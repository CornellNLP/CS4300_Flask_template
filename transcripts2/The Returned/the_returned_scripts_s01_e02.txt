 Previously on  The Returned... 
 Don't get mad at me. 
 It's not my fault. Something really weird happened. 
 I woke up in the mountains, way up above the dam. 
 Camille is here. You want to see her? 
 What are you doing? Get out! 
 [door slams] 
 Excuse me. Is Rowan here? 
 She's a waitress. 
 I don't think so. 
 I know Rowan. 
 I know where she lives. 
 [crickets chirping] 
 [knocking] 
 Rowan, it's me. Open up. 
 Go away! 
 Go away! 
 Hey, can you grab that tray? Lucy. 
 Lucy!

 Thanks so much. 
 That song was written by our guitar player, Simon, and he's gonna kick my ass for telling you all this right now, but he wrote it about a very sweet, very hot waitress he had a thing for. 
 [laughter and cheers] 
 And apparently, she liked it a lot, because tomorrow morning, she's marrying this lucky son of a bitch. 
 Right on, dude! 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not quite sure how you managed it, buddy, but congratulations. 
 To Rowan, Simon, may you live happily ever after. 
 Cheers. 
 [cheers and applause] 
 We'll be back after a short break. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 [cheers and indistinct chatter] 
 Congratulations. 
 Yeah, thanks, man.

 [sighs] 
 This is bad luck. 
 What? 
 You're not supposed to see me on our wedding day. 
 I thought that was only in your dress. 
 [grunts] 
 Nope. 
 No wedding dress under there. 
 I'm serious. I'm serious. 
 You have to go, so I can get ready. 
 [sighs] 
 We barely slept. 
 Oh, is that my fault? 
 You started it. 
 Simon? 
 Hmm. 
 What? 
 Nothing. I'll tell you later. 
 Tell me now. 
 No. 
 Later. 
 I'll get it out of you. 
 I have ways. 
 Don't you dare. 
 Don't. Don't. 
 [laughing] No, stop! 
 Ah! Stop. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 [chuckles] 
 Seriously? 
 Seriously. 
 Are you happy? 
 Oh, baby. 
 [Pachelbel's  Canon in D  playing] 
 Maybe you'd be more comfortable waiting in the office? 
 He's coming. 
 He's always late. 
 Rowan. 
 No. 
 No, he's coming. 
 [door clicks and creaks] 
 [woman vocalizing] 
 [somber music] 
 [mournful orchestral music] 
 [muffled sound] 
 [echoing] How about your vows? 
 [echo gone] Rowan? 
 Um, we were gonna write our own. 
 I haven't gotten around to mine yet. 
 It doesn't have to be Shakespeare or scripture. 
 I can give you a few templates, help get you started. 
 Yeah, that'd be great. 
 [whispers] I got to pee. 
 Ladies' room is right down that hall. 
 And how are you two doing? 
 Any nerves? 
 Cold feet? 
 Are you kidding? 
 I've been trying to get her to marry me since, what, our second date? 
 I'm excited. 
 [cell phone vibrating] 
 Ah, excuse me. 
 Nikki, what's up? 
 Sheriff, there's been an attack... 
 A young woman, in the underpass near the town hall. 
 Is she alive? 
 Barely. 
 She was stabbed, multiple times. 
 I'm on my way. 
 Go. Go. I got this. 
 Give me a kiss. 
 Now get out of here. 
 Call you later. 
 Pastor, thank you. 
 I'm so sorry for ducking out early. 
 I understand. 
 Be careful. 
 [toilet flushes] 
 [water gurgling] 
 [door rattles] 
 [eerie music] 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah, I was looking for a missing persons report for a little boy... 
 Eight years old, maybe younger, brown hair, brown eyes. 
 Why are you asking? 
 Because yesterday, when I was on my way home from the clinic, I saw this boy. 
 It was late, and he looked like he might have been lost. 
 Did you ask him if he was lost? 
 I was driving, so I just saw him. 
 Look, I'm... I'm sorry. This is stupid. 
 I'm sorry for wasting your time. 
 Wait, you said you saw the color of his eyes while you were driving by? 
 In your car? 
 Yeah. 
 What's your name, miss? 
 Julie. 
 Julie... 
 [clears throat] Han. Dr. Han. 
 Please come with me, Dr. Han. 
 I need to take your statement. 
 [eerie music] 
 [gasps] 
 Sorry, I didn't know you were in here. 
 I died, didn't I? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you afraid of me? 
 I'm afraid of myself. 
 I'm gonna use the other bathroom. 
 Would you guys please stop looking at me like that? 
 You're freaking me out. 
 Another pancake? 
 Can I have two? 
 Sure. 
 Hey. Pancakes? 
 So this is what you're gonna do, just act like everything's normal? 
 No, obviously nothing is normal, but we still have to eat breakfast. 
 So, please, sit. 
 [sighs] What is he doing here? 
 Did he stay the night? 
 No. I asked him to come over. 
 Why? 
 You know why. 
 How do we know it's even her? 
 Lena. 
 Haven't you heard of identity theft? 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 You're being ridiculous for believing that there's any way that this could be Camille. 
 Who the hell else would I be? 
 [door slams] 
 Hey. 
 Lena. 
 Why am I the only one in this family living in reality? 
 She can't just come back like this. 
 It's not possible. 
 Okay, but she's here, and it's up to all of us... 
 What? Just pretend she didn't die four years ago? 
 Act like she's the baby Jesus? 
 Want to keep your voice down, please? 
 You think you can hide her? 
 Why bother? 
 Your favorite daughter's back from the dead. 
 Why not throw a Goddamn party? 
 Stop it. 
 Gonna hit me again? 
 [somber music] 
 Victor? 
 Okay. 
 Now you're gonna talk to me. 
 I just got back from the police station. 
 Why isn't anybody looking for you? 
 Did you run away from home? 
 Did somebody hurt you? 
 Where are you from? 
 Do you understand English? 
 Victor, why won't you talk to me? 
 [sighs] 
 What happened to Simon was a terrible tragedy. 
 I know how much you've struggled. 
 Revisiting all those feelings must be very difficult, but it's going to be different this time. 
 You and Tommy are going to share a long, happy life together. 
 How could you possibly know that? 
 God only gives us what we can handle. 
 Apparently God thinks I'm Noah and Job combined. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 Do you want to get married? 
 Of course. 
 Tommy is so good to me. 
 He's... he's so good to Chloe. 
 But then a part of me is just... 
 He deserves better. 
 Why do you feel that way? 
 [sighs] 
 Last night, I... 
 I thought I saw Simon. 
 It felt so real. 
 I thought I was over it. 
 I thought I was better. 
 Rowan, it's perfectly reasonable for you to be thinking of Simon so close to your wedding day. 
 But I believe once you truly accept that you and Tommy are going to be happy together, that Simon would want that for you, then you'll find peace. 
 It's very important to make peace with our ghosts. 
 They mean us no harm.

 Yeah.

 [door clicks and keys jingle] 
 Hi, Julie. 
 Hi, Annie. 
 Hey, little guy. 
 You're just cuteness on a stick. 
 Victor, right? 
 Yep. 
 He's family, huh? 
 Yeah, he's my nephew. 
 How long is he staying? 
 I'm not sure. 
 So terrible about Mr. Goddard, isn't it? 
 What do you mean? 
 You haven't heard? 
 Suicide. 
 He jumped off the dam. 
 Wasn't he a patient of yours? 
 I mean, why would he do that? 
 Was there something wrong with him? 
 Was it cancer? 
 He didn't leave a note, so everybody's wondering. 
 When did this happen? 
 Yesterday. 
 Okay, we got to go. 
 Sorry to give you the bad news. 
 Bye, Victor. 
 What's the matter, Victor? Cat got your tongue? 
 We didn't really know her that well. 
 I mean, none of us talked to her that much. 
 When did she start working here, Lucy? 
 Ah, end of last summer? 
 Yeah. I think she's from Seattle. 
 Hey, there was this guy here earlier. 
 He totally stiffed Tony on the check. 
 He was talking to Lucy last night. Weird dude. 
 Yeah, totally sketchy. 
 What's he look like? 
 Uh, dark hair. 
 Probably 25-ish. 
 Yeah. 
 Medium build. 
 He was wearing a black suit. 
 Hey, Shane. 
 Lena. 
 Anyway, if that guy comes around again, just give me a call. 
 Will do. 
 Good luck. 
 We just need you to come down to the station, answer a few questions. 
 About Lucy? 
 Yeah, about Lucy. 
 [guitar and drum music] 
 [feedback ringing] 
 [laughter and indistinct chatter] 
 [bells jingle] 
 [drum flourish] 
 Check. 
 [somber piano music] 
 [eerie musical flourish] 
 Was Lucy alone when she left? 
 Yes. 
 Did you follow her? 
 What? No. 
 Well, what did you do? 
 I, um... 
 I swept the floor, I closed the bar, and went home. 
 Can anyone corroborate that? 
 I guess not, no. 
 Is that because you didn't go home? 
 What? 
 You followed Lucy into that tunnel, and you attacked her. 
 No. 
 You stabbed her, and you left her for dead, just like that woman seven years ago. 
 That wasn't me. 
 I wasn't charged with anything. 
 Just because we couldn't prove it then doesn't mean it wasn't you. 
 Seven years ago, October 31st, at 1:00 a.m., witnesses spotted your truck running a red light two blocks away from the scene of an attempted homicide. 
 A woman was stabbed several times in the stomach. 
 There were bite marks. 
 [sighs] 
 It was a miracle she survived. 
 I told you a thousand times, I did not hurt that woman. 
 Just like you didn't hurt Meredith Williams? 
 Carmen Santos? 
 Jen Rodriguez? 
 And now Lucy McCabe? 
 That's impossible. 
 What's impossible, Tony? 
 You sick... 
 That's enough, Banks. 
 You can step out. 
 Here's the deal. 
 I believe you. 
 But I got this feeling there's something you're not telling me, man. 
 Something that could help us put this guy away. 
 Am I right, Tony? 
 Is there something you want to tell me? 
 As you know, Jack and I had our issues before the accident, But there was a lot of love there. 
 That's the family Camille remembers. 
 I don't think she even understands we've separated. 
 And now you're hoping to work things out with Jack, now that Camille's back. 
 A week ago, I would have said it was impossible. 
 But now, the impossible's happened. 
 I've got my daughter back. 
 It's not just about us anymore. 
 I understand. 
 I hope you do. 
 Profound loss changes you. 
 For better or worse, you and Jack aren't the same people you were before Camille's accident. 
 I am concerned that if you try to re-create this marriage that you once had for Camille's benefit... 
 [sighs] 
 That's not being honest with yourself or her. 
 Is that your professional opinion? 
 That is the opinion of someone who cares about you... 
 And who doesn't want to lose you. 
 I couldn't have gotten through the last four years without you. 
 Hello, Doctor. 
 Hello. 
 Manage to get some sleep? 
 Not a wink. 
 So I guess you know I'm a zombie. 
 [chuckles] 
 You're not a zombie. 
 Oh, yeah? What am I then? 
 You're a miracle. 
 [somber music] 
 I was at your funeral. 
 I saw you in the casket. 
 And yet, somehow... 
 Here you are, with a second chance at life. 
 So all the other kids on the bus died? 
 Then why am I here? 
 That's for you to find out. 
 I don't want to be a miracle. 
 I just want my normal life back. 
 [gentle music] 
 [paper rustling] 
 Hey. 
 [sighs] 
 God, you were so handsome. 
 [sighs] 
 I want you to know that just because I'm marrying Tommy, it doesn't mean I'm ever going to stop loving you. 
 You're always gonna be a part of my heart, a part of my life. 
 I tried to forget you. 
 I had to. I... 
 I had to find a way to go on living without you. 
 But the truth is, I don't want to. 
 I don't want to let you go. 
 I know you don't really exist, but that doesn't scare me anymore. 
 I'm glad you've come back.

 Hi, it's Lena. Leave me a message. 
 And I'll call you back, probably. 
 [line beeps] 
 When did you realize she was gone? 
 Half an hour ago. I went to check if she was sleeping. 
 She'd torn up Lena's room, and she was gone. 
 Okay, did you call Lena? 
 Yeah, she's not answering. 
 It's okay. We'll find her. 
 Jack, what if we don't? 
 [sobbing] What if she never comes back? 
 Hey, that's not gonna happen. 
 [sobbing] 
 [somber music] 
 [sniffs] 
 Damn it, did you come straight from the bar? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm going to look for her. 
 Well, let's take my car. 
 I don't think it's a good idea for you to be driving right now.

 What happened?

 I saw Hunter. 
 He didn't even recognize me.

 I'm sorry. 
 You and Hunter weren't that close, were you? 
 We were in the same class.

 Moved on.

 So, Mr. Moran, we've got a problem. 
 According to our records, you're supposed to have died six years ago. 
 Want to explain how that works? 
 You're the cops. 
 Do you know Rowan Blackshaw? 
 Why are you asking me that? 
 Because Simon Moran was her boyfriend. 
 Fiancé. 
 Yeah, who died, six years ago. 
 Why are you asking me about Rowan? 
 Identity theft is a serious crime. 
 Do you realize that? 
 Why won't you answer my question? 
 What's going on here? 
 Lock him up. 
 For what? 
 [door closes] 
 [sighs] 
 [door rattles] 
 Where have you been? 
 [sighs] Why? 
 What's the worst that can happen? 
 I'm already dead. 
 [knock at door] 
 What? 
 What did you do to my room? 
 How's Ben? 
 You guys hang out a lot? 
 [crickets chirping] 
 [eerie music] 
 [creaking] 
 Get some sleep, okay? 
 Are you afraid of the dark? 
 Guess what. 
 So am I. 
 Good night.
