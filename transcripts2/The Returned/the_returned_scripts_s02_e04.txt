 Previously… 
 What do you want? 
 I’m also looking for someone. 
 You shouldn’t draw, Louis. 
 My name’s Victor. 
 Your dad was nicer? 
 Maybe he’ll come back too. 
 He’s not dead. 
 Your colleagues were all killed with a handgun. 
 We’ve found 21 bodies. One is missing. 
 Your son is waiting for you. Bring him to us. 
 You were terrified when Simon came back. 
 You were right. 
 The bite marks on the deer don’t match the teeth of an animal. 
 It was eaten by a human. 
 What was that? 
 It’s Milan. He’s looking for us. 
 What does he want? 
 To do harm. 
 Her sister is dead. 
 Help her join her sister. 
 Do it! 
 That’s why we’ve returned. To help them join us. 
 Those who are keeping us from leaving… 
 Why aren’t they like us? 
 No one was waiting for them. 
 Was someone waiting for you? 
 I don’t want to talk about it. 
 35 YEARS AGO 
 You’ve done everything you can to help your son, to keep him from hurting people and stealing. 
 You’re not responsible. 
 Sometimes, a father’s or a mother’s love is not enough. 
 Let me help you. 
 Let me help you put Virgil back on the right track. 
 Where are my parents? 
 Who are you? 
 Virgil… 
 Go away. 
 Dad? 
 Go away. 
 MISSING PERSON 
 He’s beautiful. 
 Mom. 
 Mom! 
 Where’s the baby? 
 It looks like he needed a mother. 
 See how happy they look. 
 What happened to them? 
 They died during the flood of the old village. 
 She just had a baby. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 Your child is safe, now. 
 She’s not bleeding anymore. 
 She needs a bandage, now. 
 It could get infected. I’ll see what we have in the bathroom. 
 What? 
 You don’t look like each other anymore. 
 Let her breathe. 
 Camille… 
 Don’t worry. 
 We’ll take care of you. 
 Mom… 
 My dear… 
 You’ve found anything? 
 No. 
 There’s nothing. No bandages. 
 She needs some painkillers. 
 Maybe we should ask in the house next door? 
 I’ll go. 
 No. 
 I’ll go. 
 You should stay with Léna. 
 Hello. 
 I didn’t mean to scare you. 
 Sorry. 
 Are you the one who brought me home? 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 You need help? 
 My daughter is wounded. We don’t have anything to fix her. 
 Wait here. 
 I’ll see if I can find something. 
 Can you help me? 
 Do you think she’s dead? 
 I’d rather you didn’t talk to me. 
 Who’s that? 
 I’m not sure your mom would agree. 
 It’s OK. 
 Come in. 
 Hi. 
 Take this. Come. 
 She’s such a pain. 
 Who’s in the living room? 
 I don’t know her. 
 She’s just returned. 
 What happened to her? 
 I don’t know. 
 Do you think she’s dead? 
 You would know if she was. 
 I would? 
 You can feel that kind of things. 
 For example, I feel that you know that girl. 
 Her name is Léna. 
 She’s your sister. 
 How do you know that? 
 You too, you can feel what’s hidden from you. 
 Haven’t you noticed? 
 Git it a try. 
 Your name is Virgil? 
 Well done. 
 You ride a moped. 
 Are you OK? 
 I saw what happened to you. 
 Hi, buddy. 
 Could you help me, please? 
 I know I’ve done bad things, but I got it. 
 I’ll behave. 
 Help me. 
 Come on. 
 Toni. 
 Serge, come with me. 
 Eat, Toni. 
 Look. 
 You let him go. 
 Look. 
 Look what you’ve done. 
 That’s what happens when you disobey. 
 Take this. 
 What have you done, Serge? 
 Help me. 
 I’ll forget what happened. 
 Don’t be afraid. 
 I won’t do anything to you. 
 I won’t punish you. Trust me. 
 They mean you no harm. 
 So… 
 There. 
 Their hand… 
 Their face. 
 We lost the signal for several minutes, then… 
 According to the geologist, this area is accessible from another place. 
 Should we send our men, commander? 
 Inspect the vicinity. 
 Alcide, help me. 
 It’s them. They took him, I’m sure. 
 Who did? 
 Them. 
 I can’t tell them, but you, you can believe me. 
 Help me find my son, please. 
 They won’t let you leave this place during the investigation. 
 Why? 
 Chloé called us to report that the baby was missing. 
 Chloé did. 
 And the doctor who delivered your baby was questioned. 
 He noted that you have a risky behavior. 
 They think I did it? 
 How can they think that? 
 Of course you did it. 
 You tried to kill him while you were bearing him. 
 I saw you. You got what you want. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Are you feeling better? 
 How did you come in? 
 I brought you here. 
 Are all these people dead? 
 He’s dead too? 
 Yes. 
 You think there’s a link between all these deaths? 
 I don’t know. Maybe. 
 And this boy, have you talked to him? 
 No. 
 But he was at the Helping Hand, the night of the flood. 
 You know him? 
 Yes. 
 His name is Louis Lewansky. 
 I know where he used to live. 
 Mr. Lewansky? 
 Hello? 
 What do you want? 
 Sorry. 
 I saw you at the window, so I thought… 
 You scared me. 
 You scared me too. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 The police say there were people in the house next door. 
 Have you seen anyone? 
 Why? 
 Answer me, it’s important. 
 Yes. 
 Who? 
 It was Simon. 
 He promised me he wouldn’t leave me alone. 
 I know where Milan is. Come. 
 I’d rather stay here. 
 You promised you’d help me. 
 He seems worried. 
 No, he’s hungry. 
 No. He misses his mom. 
 Adèle? 
 They’re just two strangers to him. 
 They’re not strangers. 
 What do you mean? 
 He can trust them. 
 You can, too. 
 You know them. 
 I told you you’d see your parents again. 
 Look. He’s quiet, now. 
 Don’t tell them who you are. 
 They think that child is you. 
 
 
 
 No sugar. We can’t find any. 
 Thanks. It’s nice of you. 
 Are these biscuits any good? 
 Yes. 
 Is there anyone else in the hamlet? 
 No. 
 The… 
 The house below, Mr. Lewansky, do you know what happened to him? 
 Are you family? 
 No. 
 A few years ago, I used to come to his place to give him insulin shots. 
 I’m a nurse. 
 Six months ago, he collapsed and fractured his skull. 
 He was taken to hospital. 
 Is he still there? 
 I don’t know. Maybe he’s dead. 
 Are there any relatives who would know where he is? 
 He used to live like a hermit, all alone. 
 You know what happened to him? 
 His wife and his two boys were murdered. 
 It was 35 years ago, but he had never recovered from it. 
 My husband also died at that time. 
 He was at church when the disaster happened. 
 The dam burst. 
 All those who where at church died. 
 He usually never went there, but I was sick, so he prayed for me. 
 I’ve never gone to church again. 
 It’s here? 
 Yes. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yes, thanks. 
 What is this? 
 I don’t know. 
 The house below, that is burned out, it was Mr. Costa’s. 
 He committed suicide just before the flood. 
 Do you think there’s a link? 
 For a long time, this hamlet was called “the hand of God”. 
 Did you know? 
 No. 
 Since it’s on the heights, those who lived here were saved from the flood when the dam broke. 
 But in the following years, many survivors died. 
 Violently. 
 As if God was taking back what he had given. 
 Did the person you are looking for… die at that time? 
 Yes. 
 It’s my father. 
 Audrey? 
 Are you OK? 
 Yes. 
 Your mom… 
 She’s looking for you. 
 Where is she? 
 I don’t know. 
 Here. 
 Go ahead. 
 Don’t be scared. 
 Audrey, my daughter… 
 She’s dead. 
 She came back the same night as you did. 
 Some soldiers saw her in the forest. 
 Did you see her? 
 I’m not like Pierre. You can trust me. 
 My brother used to kill young women. 
 He ate their stomachs. 
 I killed him to stop him. He had to stop. 
 Save me, please. 
 My God… 
 Your neck… 
 Help me. 
 Get me out of here. I’m begging you. 
 Your daughter… 
 What about her? 
 What about her? 
 Are you OK? 
 What did he tell you? 
 Nothing. 
 Did he talk about Audrey? Does he know where she is? 
 No. 
 What happened? 
 He has… 
 He has scratches on this neck. 
 He seems to suffer so much. 
 He doesn’t suffer. 
 How do you know? 
 He can’t suffer anymore. 
 He’s revealing his true face. 
 They had no pity. 
 We shouldn’t have any for them. 
 You shouldn’t get up, honey. 
 Sorry. 
 For what? 
 For leaving you alone. 
 I’d rather get in through here. 
 Are you OK? 
 You’re worried about your sister. 
 Yes. 
 I’m afraid of what might happen to her if she stays here. 
 I know how your mom and your sister can get back to town. 
 Really? 
 I can get them back. 
 But not you. 
 Why? 
 We need to stay together. 
 If one of us is isolated, we’re all in danger. 
 Who made you believe that? 
 Lucy did, didn’t she? 
 Remember what happened at the Helping Hand. 
 They rejected you. 
 They wanted to hurt you. 
 Léna too. 
 She didn’t. 
 You have hurt her too. 
 To defend yourself, because she rejected you. 
 Like my parents when I came back. 
 If you went back to them today, they’d understand. 
 They’d be happy to see you. 
 That’s what I thought too. 
 That’s why I went back, even though Lucy told me not to. 
 I thought that they had understood, that they had accepted. 
 But no one can accept this. 
 Lucy was right. 
 That’s what we do. 
 We unwillingly cause the death of the ones we love. 
 Where is he? 
 Just here. 
 I’ll take care of it. 
 Go get your brother. He’s waiting for you. 
 Here. 
 Thank you. I hope I’m not too much trouble. 
 Where else would you go? 
 You seem pretty lonely to me. 
 Who is this? 
 Milan. 
 He was the owner of the café. 
 Everybody knew him. 
 A brave man, someone you could count on. 
 He helped me after my husband died. 
 He helped many people. Because after the disaster, we were all alone. 
 The police, the government, no one was there. 
 Fortunately, we had people like him to prevent looting and burglaries. 
 He created vigilance groups to discourage any burglars. 
 The Lewanskys were killed during a burglary that went wrong? 
 That what people say, but it wasn’t the truth. 
 What happened? 
 People were afraid. 
 Afraid of Mr. Lewansky? 
 No. Afraid of the little boy. 
 Vic… Louis? 
 People said all sorts of stories about him. 
 Weird stories. 
 Like what? 
 They said what happened what his fault. 
 The dam burst. 
 People said he was the devil. 
 But why? 
 People were a little crazy, back then. 
 We were lost. 
 We wanted someone to blame. 
 There were so many deaths. 
 You need to have experienced that to understand. 
 Jérôme? 
 What? 
 Can you help me? 
 What is this? 
 Think about it. 
 No! 
 What happened to you? 
 How did you die? 
 We’ve joined the circle. 
 We’ve found the passage. 
 Please. 
 Come. 
 Are you OK? 
 I’ve brought you something to eat. 
 I’ll get you out of here. 
 Don’t! 
 Please. 
 We need to leave. 
 They’ll come and get him. 
 Lucy… 
 I knew I’d see you again. 
 I’ve never given up on you. 
 I did it to save you. 
 I love you. 
 I forgive you.
