 Previously… 
 The bite marks on the deer don’t match the teeth of an animal. 
 It was eaten by a human. 
 What was that? 
 Let us leave, Pierre. 
 I can’t do that. 
 She’s like them. 
 They can make us commit suicide? 
 We need to leave. Come with us. 
 I can’t. 
 You said none of us could stay alone. Or we’d end up like the others. 
 Don’t you trust me anymore? 
 Did your father die when the dam broke? 
 He designed it. 
 You need to stop building the dam. You believe me? 
 You were with Victor? 
 He wanted to leave. 
 He wanted to find you. He was worried about you. 
 You decide on everything. 
 I don’t decide on anything. 
 You can count on me. I’ll help you to see this through. 
 I need to get back my son. I’ll be back with Nathan. 
 36 YEARS AGO 
 Good evening. 
 Good evening. 
 I don’t have money, but if you hire me, I’ll have a drink. 
 It’s calm around here. 
 And I already have a staff. 
 Too bad. 
 What are you doing around here? 
 Are you moving in? 
 I’m looking for someone. 
 Tell me who. I know everyone, here. 
 He’s not here yet. 
 A man? 
 No, a little boy. 
 Where are you from? 
 From far away. 
 I’m really tired. 
 Shall I offer you this drink? 
 All right. 
 I’ll take care of you. 
 Thank you. 
 THE RETURNED 
 Lucy. 
 It’s too late. 
 What happened? 
 I’ve lost them. 
 They don’t trust me anymore. 
 They’re in danger because of me. 
 I’m sure everything isn’t lost. 
 I took revenge on Milan. 
 Milan? 
 I hurt one of them. 
 I had to protect them, all of them. 
 I failed. 
 The baby is gone. 
 So are Adèle Werther and the Ségurets. 
 Are you OK, Major? 
 Yes. 
 What about the little boy? 
 He’s gone, too. 
 We have set up roadblocks, and patrols in all the valley. 
 Good. 
 I’ll check it out. They may be waiting for us. 
 Wait. 
 Take this. 
 Take it. 
 I’m coming with you. 
 Where will we go? 
 Wait, Dad. 
 What? 
 You have to help me. 
 Help you do what? 
 We’ll go to the hospital once we have left. 
 It’s because I’m far from the others. 
 I can’t stay with you. 
 I need to join them. 
 No, you can’t do that. 
 Please. 
 Léna and Mom won’t listen to me. 
 You have to make them understand. 
 You’re in danger with me, and I’m in danger with you. 
 That’s not true. 
 I’m begging you. 
 He lost his nerves. We had to shoot him. 
 What’s happening? 
 Several of them were at the gymnasium. 
 They got away. 
 The captain and a soldier have died. 
 We need to find them. 
 What do they want? 
 Do you know who I am? 
 You took my drawings? 
 I remember you. 
 You came to see me. 
 You told me what would happen. 
 I didn’t listen to you. 
 How did you know? 
 About the dam? 
 He’s not responsible. 
 If I had listened to you, we would all had been saved. 
 I can’t change anything. 
 Who is it? 
 It’s Julie. 
 Something will happen to her? 
 You believe me? 
 Where is she? 
 Even if I tried, I wouldn’t be able to save her. 
 I’ll help you. 
 Mom? 
 Please. 
 She’s not moving. 
 She’s not moving. 
 Pull over, Jérôme. 
 It’s the military? 
 They have set up roadblocks. 
 What are we going to do? 
 I know another path. 
 This is where you were living? 
 Yes. 
 I’ll check upstairs. 
 What are you doing? 
 They have left. 
 They must have got to the forest. 
 You knew. 
 No. 
 Why have you brought me here? 
 I thought Lucy would be here. 
 She asked you to do it? 
 To take me away from Nathan? 
 I also want to find our child. 
 I want us to be together. 
 You’re lying. 
 What did you do to him? 
 Adèle, I promise you… 
 Stop it with your promises. 
 Stop it. I don’t believe you anymore. 
 You promised you’d always love me. 
 I don’t trust you anymore. 
 Adèle… 
 Let go of me. 
 Adèle! 
 Why did you do that? 
 Why did you do that? 
 I wanted to be with you. 
 I didn’t want to be alone anymore. 
 I’m sorry. 
 I won’t leave you ever again. 
 Help me join Nathan. 
 I’m begging you. 
 Have you found Adèle? 
 No. 
 Do you know where Simon Delaître is? 
 No. 
 But he was here. 
 He was hiding with Adèle Werther. 
 Tell me what you know. 
 All those rumors about what happened six months ago, those stories told by some people, are they true? 
 Have dead people come back? 
 Yes. 
 You’ve seen one of them? 
 Yes, I think. 
 At first, I was scared, too. 
 But we shouldn’t be scared of them. 
 On the contrary, I think… 
 We have to help them do what they have to do. 
 What do they want? 
 To understand what happened to them. 
 To find their loved ones. 
 But maybe they don’t know that themselves. 
 Lieutenant. 
 Who are they? 
 We found them in the forest. 
 Next to the domain. 
 They won’t give us their identities. 
 They were living in the domain? 
 Most likely. 
 Take them downstairs and keep a close watch on them. 
 All right, Lieutenant. 
 Take them downstairs. 
 Don’t do that. 
 I’m begging you. 
 Don’t do that. 
 It’s not the military. 
 Hide, Camille. 
 It’s Frédéric. 
 Why are you here? 
 She’s here? 
 What do you want? 
 To protect you from her. 
 Back off. 
 Frédéric… 
 Don’t attack them. 
 Let us leave. 
 Please. 
 Camille! 
 Camille! 
 
 
 
 Are you OK? You need to take a break? 
 I’ll be fine. 
 Watch out. 
 What is it? 
 Someone is here. 
 Adèle! 
 Sweetie. 
 Adèle? 
 It’s not her. 
 It’s not Chloé. 
 What’s happening, Jérôme? 
 Turn around. 
 I can’t. 
 Stop the car. 
 Camille… 
 Camille is not breathing. 
 Camille… 
 Is she really dead? 
 Pierre. 
 You need to talk to us. 
 You told us we were safe here. 
 We trusted you. 
 We obeyed. 
 We did everything you told us. 
 But Sandrine… 
 She died. 
 She chose to join her daughter. 
 She chose to die. 
 No, that’s not true. 
 She died because of you. 
 Because of you, the Helping Hand is not safe anymore. 
 Those who don’t feel safe can leave. 
 Do you know where to go? 
 Yes. 
 Let them leave. 
 Are you sure? 
 Stop searching the forest and remove the roadblocks. 
 All right, Major. 
 Others are here, too. 
 It’s thanks to the child. 
 They trust him. 
 Let’s go find the others. 
 Do something. I’m begging you. 
 What happened to her? 
 She wanted to die. 
 You don’t. 
 Étienne… 
 You were with us in the clearing. 
 Milan… 
 Has he returned, too? 
 Most likely. 
 You’re here to take revenge? 
 No. 
 No one wants to take revenge. 
 We are as you want to see us. 
 They’ve come for us. 
 Wait. 
 Don’t go with them. 
 It’s where I belong. 
 Among them, I don’t suffer anymore. 
 I need you. 
 I don’t know who you are. 
 You should forget about me. 
 Let’s go. 
 Thank you. 
 Will I see you again? 
 Don’t worry. 
 I’ll be back. 
 Milan? 
 Pierre. 
 You didn’t make the gesture. 
 I should have listened to you. 
 You were right. 
 Only those who make the gesture will be saved. 
 That’s what you said. 
 No one is saved. 
 I was wrong. 
 The little boy didn’t want all that. 
 Dying has no meaning. 
 See how alone I am. 
 You won’t be alone anymore. 
 Claire… 
 Wait. 
 They mean her no harm. 
 I need to join them. 
 We have to let her go. 
 No… 
 Don’t worry. I won’t be alone. 
 Take good care of Léna. 
 I can’t live without you. 
 We won’t be apart. 
 We’ll always be together. 
 You felt it earlier. 
 I can’t. 
 I’ll be happy. 
 Where are we? 
 Our hideout before the domain. 
 They’re here? 
 Maybe inside the cave. I’ll check it out. 
 Wait. I’m coming with you. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 Simon? 
 35 YEARS AGO Dad. 
 But you’re dead. 
 Yes. 
 Don’t tell anyone I’m here. Never. 
 Yes? 
 Dinner is ready. You’re coming? 
 Yes, Dad. 
 Hello? 
 Please come. I’m not feeling well. 
 Dad! 
 Don’t leave me. Please. 
 Come back. 
 Come back, Dad. 
 Let us leave! Stop! He has to come with me. They’re waiting for you to take care of them. Them, who? You know what will happen to her if she stays with you. What are you doing? I don’t want you to die. You did your best. Shut up. Victor, I won’t leave you. You understand? I won’t leave you. I want you to live. Of course, I’ll live. Please, let me go. If I leave, you’ll be safe. You’ll be happy. I won’t be happy without you. I’ll be unhappy. I saw you with that child. What child? The one in my dream. You’ll be happy with him. Believe me. Make my dream come true. Please. Come. You have to help us. They’re counting on you. It’s Adèle’s child? Yes. He can’t come with us. You need to take care of him. I’m sorry. I can’t make it. I can’t live without you. If you want to, you can change things. She believes you. Julie… Julie… Victor… Julie… Where are they? They have left. We can’t stay here. Here. They were out of raspberry. I took strawberry. It’s perfect. You don’t want some? No, thanks. Victor! Wait. Victor, you’re coming? Thanks. What the… Olivier.
