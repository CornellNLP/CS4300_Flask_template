 Previously… 
 I did it to save you. I love you. 
 Bring your son to us. 
 He misses his mom. 
 Chloé called us to report that the baby was missing. 
 We need to leave. They’ll come and get him. 
 What’s that blood? You did it again? 
 I had to keep you from hurting people. You couldn’t help it. 
 Claire and Camille, I don’t know where they are. 
 I’m also looking for someone. I can help you. 
 Sorry for leaving you alone. 
 You shouldn’t draw, Louis. 
 My name’s Victor. 
 Your dad was nicer? 
 Maybe he’ll come back too. 
 He’s not dead. 
 People were afraid of the boy. 
 Louis? 
 People said he was the devil. 
 MRS. COSTA 
 35 YEARS AGO 
 3 MONTHS AFTER THE DAM BURST 
 I know you. You’re one of my husband’s students? 
 Yes. 
 What’s that? 
 A dog. 
 That woman is pulling a strange face. 
 It’s you. 
 Really? 
 Is she sleeping? 
 No. 
 Good evening, Mrs. Costa. 
 Good evening. 
 You’re coming, Louis? 
 Thank you, Mr. Costa. Say goodbye, Louis. 
 Goodbye. 
 Goodbye, Louis. 
 What’s happening? 
 She has a problem with her son. 
 No one wants to sit next to him. 
 The other kids laugh at him. 
 He drew this? 
 He drew the same thing dozens of times. 
 He can’t be the only one traumatized by what happened. 
 He drew that before the dam burst. 
 Before? 
 Soon, they’ll blame him for this. 
 Did you walk the dog? 
 No. 
 If I break a leg, it will be your fault. 
 Titus! 
 Titus! 
 Titus! 
 Titus! 
 Stupid dog. 
 Titus! 
 Titus! 
 Titus! 
 Come here, Titus. 
 Titus! 
 Come on. Your turn. 
 My turn. 
 We need to leave. 
 What’s happening? 
 Julie. Something will happen to her. 
 We need to warn her. 
 How do you know? 
 I just do. 
 Come with me. 
 What about your mom? 
 We don’t need her. 
 You know they won’t let us leave the domain. 
 Come. 
 What are you doing? 
 I’m leaving. 
 Hello. You’re Mr. Lewanski’s visitor? 
 Yes. 
 Come with me. 
 Are you a relative? 
 Not really. 
 Not really? 
 Actually, I used to look after him at his place for a long time. 
 You’re a nurse? 
 Yes. 
 Hello, Mr. Lewanski. 
 You have a visitor. 
 Come in. 
 What’s your name? 
 Julie. 
 Julie has come to see how you’re doing. 
 Come closer. 
 You can talk to him. He can hear you. 
 Tell him anything you want. What you did yesterday, for example. 
 He’s in a coma? 
 You didn’t know? 
 No. 
 I’m sorry. 
 I thought you knew. 
 What’s with him? 
 He’s been in a coma for six months. 
 He fell and has a head trauma. 
 We couldn’t find any relatives of his. 
 Do you know any? 
 No. 
 It’s a good thing that you’ve come. You’re his first visitor. 
 You know where you’re going? 
 Let’s go back. 
 No. 
 Please help us. 
 It’s an old heater, but it’s still effective. 
 The room should be warm soon. 
 I have more blankets. 
 Thanks. 
 Is the baby OK? 
 I think so. 
 I’ll inform the doctor. 
 Don’t. 
 Are you sure? 
 Don’t tell anyone. 
 All right. 
 I’m not sure we can trust him. 
 You don’t have to stay. 
 I’ll keep a watch outside. 
 What are you doing? 
 I’m going with him. 
 Stay here. 
 Close the door. 
 Watch over the others. 
 Do you know where he took the baby? 
 No, but we’ll find him. 
 Don’t worry. 
 Camille. 
 Careful. 
 Is Audrey back? 
 No. 
 She must have left the domain. 
 I doubt it. 
 We can’t leave here. 
 I managed to come here. 
 Don’t worry. 
 We’ll find a way to leave this place. 
 You need to get some rest first. 
 Is Dad OK? 
 Yes. 
 Does he know you’re here? 
 No. 
 Why? 
 We had a row. 
 Why? 
 It’s hard to explain. 
 He’s forgotten about us? 
 Are you crazy? 
 He’s been looking for you and Mom for months. 
 How could he forget about you? 
 It would have been simpler if you had forgotten about me. 
 Don’t say that. 
 We’re not leaving each other anymore. 
 SCHOOL BUS TRAGEDY: NO SURVIVORS A THIRD YOUNG WOMAN HORRIBLY MUTILATED TRAGEDY AT THE NIGHT CLUB “302”: MORE THAN TEN DEATHS SUICIDE OF A SCHOOL TEACHER ON THE DAM SHOOTING OF THE LEWANSKIS: A BURGLARY THAT WENT WRONG 
 It doesn’t seem like they were all drawn during the same period. 
 Some look more recent than others. 
 DAM BURST 
 Did your father die when the dam broke? 
 No. 
 Actually, he designed it. He was the construction engineer. 
 And… how did he die? 
 That’s what I want to find out. 
 ARCHITECT ÉTIENNE BERG 
 Hello? 
 I’m Audrey. Audrey Sabatini. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Yes. 
 I can’t find my parents. Do you know where they are? 
 Come in. 
 Don’t worry. 
 She was in the bus with Camille. 
 We know what happened to you. 
 It’s very big. 
 It’s near the mountain. 
 All the houses look alike. 
 Where is that domain? 
 I don’t know. 
 I think it’s after the shopping mall. 
 Can you trace it back? 
 I don’t want to go back there. It’s too dangerous. 
 All these people are keeping us from leaving. 
 Camille, Claire and Léna need us. 
 Help us find them. 
 I can’t. 
 Come. 
 Take a look. Tell me where it is. 
 What’s that? 
 Look at the map, Audrey. 
 Where is it? 
 I don’t know. 
 You have to remember. 
 We just want you to help us find them. Look at the map. 
 We’re here. 
 Try to remember where you’ve been. 
 Retrace it backwards. 
 I think it’s there. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 Where are my parents? 
 Have they left town? 
 No. They’re at the Helping Hand. 
 The Helping Hand? 
 Why are they there? 
 I’ll tell them you’re here. 
 I’m coming. 
 I’d rather you stayed here. 
 I don’t want to stay alone. 
 Listen to me. 
 No one will come here. Trust me. I’ll come back with them, OK? 
 Please hurry. 
 So? 
 He should see a doctor. 
 Emmanuel is a doctor. He knows what he’s doing. 
 We could take him to the hospital. 
 We’re fully equipped, here. 
 Pierre? 
 Everyone is ready. 
 What are you doing? 
 We need to find Toni and those who helped him escape. 
 We need to keep them from hurting people. 
 We need to leave. The police is at the door. 
 Come, Chloé. 
 No, stay here. 
 Don’t worry. I’ll make them leave. 
 He’s told them. 
 No, I haven’t told anyone. 
 You can trust me, Simon. 
 I won’t repeat the same mistake. 
 
 
 
 Hello, gentlemen. 
 Father. 
 May I help you? 
 Has Adèle Werther come to see you? 
 No, why? 
 She has disappeared. 
 We’re looking for her. 
 I’ll let you know if she comes here. 
 What’s over there? 
 The presbytery. 
 My accommodation. 
 Can we have a look? 
 Sorry, it’s the orders. 
 Stay here. 
 Someone is here. 
 No one is here. You can trust me. 
 We’ve found the missing police officers. 
 Sorry? 
 Their bodies were hung to trees. 
 On some of them, we’ve found bite marks. 
 Not animal bite marks. 
 Human bite marks. 
 Who could have done that? 
 I know all the stories that people tell. 
 About the dead. 
 I believe them. 
 It’s Him, isn’t it? 
 He’s testing us? 
 I’m scared, Father. 
 Go back to sleep. 
 Go back to sleep, Nathan. 
 It’s OK. They’re gone. 
 Wait for me here. 
 Audrey is at my place. 
 She’s waiting for you. 
 No. 
 It’s not her. 
 It’s not Audrey. 
 Yes, it is. 
 She’s terrified by what’s happening to her. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Go to the Lake Pub. 
 Don’t tell Pierre. Go with Yann find your daughter at my house, and leave town immediately. 
 When you’ll be in front of her, it will be obvious. 
 You won’t have any doubts. 
 What’s the matter? 
 I was looking for Frédéric. 
 I hoped he knew where Léna is. 
 If we find out anything, we’ll tell you immediately. 
 I’m sure of it. 
 It’s going to sting. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yes. 
 We need to leave tonight. 
 We should wait for your father. 
 He can’t come here. He doesn’t know I’m here. 
 We can only count on ourselves. 
 They won’t let us leave. 
 We’ll try and defend ourselves. 
 We’ve already tried. 
 You’re hurting me. 
 Sorry. 
 What happened? 
 They showed up all of a sudden. 
 They pounced on us. 
 What did they do to you? 
 To Camille, nothing. 
 But they hit me. 
 They hit me until I collapsed. 
 They won’t let us leave. 
 Here, at least, we’re together. 
 The three of us. 
 Esteban? 
 Esteban? 
 Esteban? 
 Esteban? 
 What’s wrong? 
 We’ve been trying to speak to him. It looks like he can’t hear us. 
 Esteban, are you OK? 
 Esteban? 
 Esteban, look at me. 
 Don’t touch him. 
 Esteban? 
 You’re annoying! 
 Leave him be, Camille. 
 Esteban, stop doing this! 
 Camille! 
 Stop it, Camille! 
 He’s faking it! 
 Don’t you see he’s faking it? 
 The old dam is here. 
 The cave-in, here. The new dam, over there. 
 Exploring the cave-in has revealed numerous galleries linking the lake to the groundwater under the town. 
 What we don’t understand is that no topographical survey has showed those cavities up to now. 
 We need to precisely determine the watercourse. 
 We might have found why the flood is persisting in this area. 
 The water that is flooding the town would come from the lake? 
 That’s right. 
 If you know where the water flows, can you cut it? 
 It’s a wide network. 
 Several places are accessible, and we’ll be able to take action, hoping it will be enough to slow down the water flow. 
 Operations are in progress. 
 We’re counting on you. 
 MISSING PERSONS 
 Julie? 
 I was looking for you. 
 Mr. Lewanski’s eyelids moved. 
 His nervous system works at intervals. 
 There’s a good chance he won’t wake up soon. 
 You should go home. 
 I have plenty of time. 
 Give me your number. 
 I’ll call you as soon as something happens. 
 I’d rather wait. 
 Where do you live? 
 Downtown. 
 There’s no one left there. 
 I used to live there. I moved. 
 Where do you live now? 
 Sorry, I didn’t mean to pry. 
 You were missing? 
 No. 
 What happened to you? 
 Nothing. 
 You’re hiding? 
 Come with me. 
 This wing is closed. 
 You can stay here. No one will come. 
 Are you hungry? I can bring you some food. 
 Thank you. 
 Your family must be worried, don’t you think? 
 Maybe they think you’re dead. You should let them know. 
 I don’t think anyone is worrying about me. 
 You must have some friends. 
 Parents? 
 They’re dead. 
 I’m sorry. 
 See you later. 
 My name’s Ophélie. 
 Mom? 
 Mom? 
 Mom, it’s me. 
 Mom, look at me. Look at me, Mom. 
 Look at me! 
 Who’s that? 
 Mom… 
 I wanted to make sure I wasn’t dreaming last night. 
 Esteban… 
 He’s weird since this morning. 
 Weird? 
 He doesn’t react. 
 He doesn’t answer. 
 He’s like the others. 
 It’s because his parents are dead? Because of what I told him? 
 That would have happened to him, anyway. 
 He’s alone, now. 
 He’s not alone. We’re all together. 
 Will we become like him? 
 We are like him. 
 You won’t leave me by myself? 
 I won’t. 
 Never? 
 I promise you. 
 Wait here. 
 They can slow down the flood. They’re closing the area to do research. 
 We need to cross. 
 Tonight or tomorrow morning. 
 I’m sure there’s another path to the northeast. 
 I’m coming with you. 
 Hello. 
 My name’s Toni. 
 Serge is not here? 
 Who are they? 
 I don’t know. They don’t talk. 
 They can’t stay here. 
 We can’t kick them out. 
 Where are they coming from? 
 I don’t know. 
 Do you think they’re like us? 
 Look. They seem to know you. 
 I don’t know them. 
 Serge! 
 You don’t know them? 
 No. 
 Yes, you do. 
 They were in the tunnel? 
 Is that it? They all were in the tunnel? 
 You killed them! 
 Huh? 
 Adèle? 
 Miss? 
 Alcide? 
 I was waiting for you. 
 Don’t move. 
 I won’t hurt you. 
 Stop. 
 It’s you. 
 You’ve kidnapped the child. 
 No. 
 I’m looking for him too. 
 I’m scared too. I’m scared for him. 
 Feel how strong my heart is beating. 
 Where are the others? 
 They’re waiting for me to come back with Simon and the child. 
 Then we’ll leave. Help me find them. 
 My colleagues. 
 What did you do to them? 
 We did nothing. 
 I saw them. I saw the bodies. 
 You think we’re capable of doing that? 
 It wasn’t us, Alcide. We tried to protect them. 
 We didn’t want them to lash out on them. 
 We hung them to the trees so that they can’t be hurt any more. 
 Who could hurt them? 
 You have to believe me. 
 We didn’t hurt them, and we won’t hurt the child. 
 Why do you want him? 
 I won’t be able to find the path without him. 
 I’m begging you. 
 Everyone’s fate depends on you. 
 You want to hold him? 
 Hold his head. 
 Take him under his bottom. 
 Can we baptize him? 
 Don’t tell Mom, please. 
 I doubt your Julie is here. 
 She’ll be back. 
 You want to wait here? 
 All right… 
 You could have turned on the light. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. 
 If you need anything, just ask. 
 I wanted to know… the police officers on the posters, do you know if they were found? 
 They’re dead. 
 You knew one of them? 
 Yes. 
 I’m sorry. 
 Esteban? 
 Esteban… 
 Let him. 
 Who are they? 
 His new family. 
 He’s like them, now. 
 Mom? 
 Where are they taking me? 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 You took a wise decision. 
 You like this? 
 Good. There’s nothing else. 
 How did you know they would let us leave? 
 I had a nightmare. It was how it happened. 
 A nightmare? 
 Yes. 
 Do your nightmares often come true? 
 Always.
