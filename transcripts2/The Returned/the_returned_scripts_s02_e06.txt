 They were all killed with a handgun. 
 Previously… 
 We’ve found 21 bodies. One is missing. 
 You’ve kidnapped the child. Why do you want him? 
 I won’t find the path without him. Help me, then we’ll leave. 
 Audrey is at my place. 
 Where are they taking me? 
 Wise decision. 
 I’m also looking for someone. I can help you. 
 Did your father die when the dam broke? 
 No. He designed it. 
 If I can understand this combination, I’ll know where and when Claire and Camille will be back. 
 We’ll leave this place. 
 They won’t let us leave. 
 I’m leaving. Something will happen to Julie. 
 Julie has come to see you. We couldn’t find any relatives of his. 
 The child would have been unhappy. 
 What child? 
 The one in your belly when he attacked you. 
 You killed them! 
 10 YEARS AGO Don’t go in there. 
 You scared me. 
 Well… 
 What are you doing here? Are you lost? 
 Are you OK? 
 Don’t go into the tunnel. 
 What’s in the tunnel? Something frightens you? 
 Do you live in the neighborhood? 
 Don’t go in there. 
 I’ll take you home. 
 It’s over. It will be OK. 
 They have to leave. You shouldn’t have let them in. 
 We can’t do that. 
 Where would they go? 
 It’s not our problem. 
 Yes, it is. 
 It’s our problem. 
 I think I know one of them. 
 She used to work at the bank. She would often come to the Lake Pub. 
 She was very nice. 
 She lived with her parents behind the media library. 
 Her name is Esther. 
 Do you think her parents are still here? 
 No. 
 They must have left. 
 You don’t know that. 
 What if they’re still here? 
 We have to go. 
 You have to bring their daughter back. 
 No… 
 You have to do it. 
 You have to redeem yourself. 
 It’s like a second chance. 
 I haven’t asked for anything. 
 I’ll help you, Serge. 
 Are you lost? 
 No. 
 I didn’t think it was this far. 
 We need to keep going. 
 What the hell is this? 
 I’ve already seen this near the old dam. 
 Maybe it’s them. 
 Maybe they did this. 
 Someone is here. 
 I hoped you’d come. 
 My dear. 
 You want some coffee? 
 Yes. 
 You look better. 
 Is your sister still sleeping? 
 I don’t know. 
 I’ll check on her. 
 Camille! 
 Mom… 
 Go away. 
 Mom? 
 Calm down. 
 Get out of here. 
 What’s going on? 
 Mom, stop it. 
 Put that down. 
 Get out. 
 Get the hell out of here. 
 I’m going. 
 No, Mom! 
 Drop the scissors. 
 Drop the scissors. 
 Drop them! 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Are you crazy? 
 So? 
 The level has lowered. 
 It appears we were right, then. 
 Captain, we need you. 
 He seems to be smiling. 
 I’ll prepare his bottle. 
 Adèle… 
 Don’t be afraid. 
 Something happened. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yes, I’m fine. 
 I’ll bring you some water. 
 No. What happened? 
 The military have found a body. 
 And it would appear that it is Thomas. 
 They’re not sure? 
 No, but… it’s very likely. 
 I’m sorry. 
 I want to go there. 
 I’m not sure it’s a good idea. 
 I need to see him. 
 She used to live in one of these buildings. 
 Are you sure? 
 Did you live here? 
 Do you remember anything? 
 Don’t insist. She doesn’t talk. 
 It’s useless. 
 I’ll see if there are still people. 
 There’s no one left. 
 Toni. 
 Maybe we can leave her here. 
 Where is she going? 
 Toni! 
 Are you sure it’s her? 
 I’m not, but the police officer who saw her at the hospital was. 
 He’s been seeing her photo all day for six months. 
 Could he talk to her? 
 No. 
 He saw her in a corridor with a nurse. 
 She must have left. 
 Is she… 
 Is she like Toni Garrel? 
 Maybe. 
 You want us to go to her place? 
 No, we’ll take care of it. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I knew we were the same size. 
 It’s yours? 
 Yes. 
 Thanks. 
 Mr. Lewanski has awaken from the coma. 
 Can I see him? 
 Just five minutes, then. 
 Hello, Mr. Lewanski. 
 Do you recognize me? 
 My name’s Julie. I used to nurse you at your place. 
 I know your son. 
 Louis. 
 I was with him. 
 And he’s fine. 
 I know… what happened to him. 
 He talked about you. 
 And he’s waiting for you. 
 He needs you. You need to hang in there. 
 Your wife… and your son, Paul… they’ve come back, too. 
 And they’re together, the three of them. 
 You mustn’t… 
 What did you say? 
 What’s happening? 
 I don’t know. 
 Please step aside. 
 Stay with us, Mr. Lewanski. We’re taking care of you. 
 Are you OK, Mr. Lewanski? 
 Lay him down. 
 We’re taking care of you. 
 What are you doing? 
 I’m taking Nathan to the police station. 
 They’ll see he’s OK. 
 What? They won’t let you leave. 
 They’ll keep him. 
 They have no reason to. 
 I’ve done nothing wrong. 
 Come on, Chloé. 
 No. 
 I’m staying with Dad. 
 As you like. 
 How is he? 
 He’s stabilized, but very weakened. 
 Who are you? 
 I told you. 
 Stop lying to me, already. 
 I trusted you and allowed you to see him. 
 Because of you, he had an heart attack. 
 I’m sorry. 
 Are you really a nurse? 
 Yes. 
 What happened? 
 Nothing… I don’t know. 
 Could you talk to him? 
 Yes, a little. 
 What did you say to him? 
 It’s complicated. 
 Why don’t you trust me? 
 You wouldn’t believe me. 
 I would. 
 No. 
 Try. 
 Mr. Lewanski is… the father of a little boy I know. 
 And I had taken care of him for a while… and I told him about that. That’s it. 
 A little boy? 
 Yes. 
 Paul? 
 No, Victor… Louis. 
 According to his medical record, Mr. Lewanski only had one boy. 
 He died 35 years ago. His name was Paul. 
 Who’s the child you’re talking about? 
 He had two boys. 
 Not according to his medical record. 
 This child, when was he born? 
 You have to help us. 
 You’re a restless sleeper, aren’t you? 
 What’s that? 
 Someone is here. Come. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 It’s you. 
 Help! 
 Help me! Mom! 
 Tell us where the others are. 
 I don’t know. 
 You said you were with them. What’s their names? 
 What are these scratches? 
 I don’t know. 
 See if she has others. 
 Mom! Let go of me! 
 Stay still. 
 What are you doing to her? 
 Nothing. Go back upstairs with me. 
 I want to see her. 
 That’s not possible. 
 Just five minutes. I’m begging you. 
 Let go of me! 
 I need to see she’s not Audrey, that she doesn’t look like her. 
 Sandrine. 
 She does look like her. 
 She’s nearly the same. 
 She has her voice, her eyes, but she’s not your daughter. 
 She’s here to deceive you. 
 Audrey is dead. 
 She won’t come back. 
 It’s too hard. 
 We’ll help you. 
 They’re probably somewhere near us. 
 We need to find their weak point. 
 Thanks to you, to your lucidity, to your confidence, we’ll hopefully find it. 
 Mom! Mom! 
 Calm down! 
 Come. 
 
 
 
 You think it’s them? 
 Probably. 
 Can we recognize them? 
 What do you mean? 
 Do they have distinctive marks? 
 No. 
 Camille hasn’t changed. 
 Neither has Audrey. 
 Are you feeling better? 
 He wanted to make her come with them. 
 I couldn’t let him. 
 I had to stop him. 
 I have to protect her. 
 We have to protect her. 
 Camille is not like them. 
 You should get some sleep. 
 You’re right. 
 My Léna, will you stay with me for a little while? 
 Yes. 
 It was the guy from yesterday? 
 His name is Virgil. 
 You shouldn’t let him in. 
 Didn’t you do the same thing with Frédéric? 
 You’re scared of him? I’m like him. 
 Stop it! 
 They’re not like you. 
 They can hurt us. 
 No. 
 Mom told me what happened when you tried to leave. 
 What did she say? 
 They attacked you. 
 They hit her. 
 No on attacked her. 
 It was like earlier. She hit herself. 
 You saw what happened. Virgil didn’t mean any harm. 
 Why would she do that? 
 I don’t know. 
 They didn’t attack you? 
 No. 
 They were around us, but they didn’t come close. 
 Mom thought they attacked her, but it was her. 
 I had to make her stop. Her face was covered in blood. 
 Virgil told me he could get you and Mom out of the domain. 
 You need to listen to him. You two can’t stay here. 
 She’ll kill herself. 
 Leaving you here by yourself is out of the question. 
 All right? 
 I’ll never leave you. 
 Who’s that? 
 Come with me. 
 I don’t understand. Where was your child all this time? 
 I don’t know. 
 Yesterday morning, you found him at your front door? 
 Yes. 
 Why didn’t you come here immediately? 
 I went to see Father Jean-François. 
 I trust him. 
 All right. 
 We’ll examine your child for any after-effects. 
 You’ll stay with us during the investigation. 
 To make sure the child is not in danger. 
 About Captain Mezache… 
 How did he die? 
 The investigation’s still in progress. 
 I’d like to see him. 
 That’s not possible. 
 It’s been months. I need to see him. 
 I’m sorry. It’s the procedure. 
 And… 
 After six months, his body is… 
 I just need to feel his presence. 
 I won’t stay long. 
 The military are in charge of the investigation. 
 Please. 
 Yes? 
 Can I be alone with him for a moment? 
 Just a minute. 
 You shouldn’t do that. 
 You should keep the image you had of me. 
 I want to make sure you’re dead. 
 You want to know how I died. 
 He did that to you? 
 It’s Simon? 
 Who else? 
 How can you trust him? 
 You know what he’s capable of. 
 Miss Werther needs to stay here. 
 We’ll take care of the child. 
 Hail Mary, full of grace. 
 Our Lord is with you. 
 Blessed are you among women, and blessed is… 
 Hi, Chloé. 
 You remember me? 
 Stay away from her. 
 You’re waiting for the bride, this time? 
 If you touch Adèle… 
 No one will hurt her as much as you. 
 Shut up. 
 You’ve ruined her life. 
 You’ve made her miserable. 
 I love her. 
 No, you don’t. 
 If you did, you wouldn’t have killed yourself. 
 I won’t leave her again. 
 Then she’ll end up like you. 
 Whatever you do. 
 I don’t believe you anymore. 
 Yes, you do. 
 Come with us. 
 No. 
 It’s over. 
 He’s alive? 
 Come. 
 Tell her you’re sorry. 
 Tell her you’re sorry! 
 I’m sorry… 
 I’m sorry. 
 Where is the little boy? 
 What do we do? 
 We’ll take them to the Helping Hand. 
 Are you sure? 
 We can’t leave them here. 
 I’m sick of this. Come. 
 Sit down. 
 We won’t wait all day. 
 Don’t move. 
 Or what? 
 Don’t make me shoot. 
 Go ahead. Shoot, cowboy. 
 Shut up, or… 
 sh1t. 
 What have you done? 
 Do you remember your last name? 
 Or someone you know? 
 Maybe family members, or friends who could recognize you? 
 Those who did that to you? 
 I’ve lost her. 
 You’ve lost who? 
 I love her. 
 I told her. 
 I’ve never told her before. 
 I’ve lost her. 
 Camille. 
 Camille. 
 What are you doing? 
 I’ll get help. Wait for me. 
 What? 
 We have no choice. 
 But they’ll lash out at you. 
 You said they won’t hurt us. 
 You’re the one they want to keep from leaving. 
 How will you do that? 
 I’ll find my way back. 
 I’ll be back. Take care of Mom. 
 Wait… 
 Excuse me. Yes, Frédéric? 
 Calm down. 
 Tell me what’s happening. 
 Are you sure she’s dead? 
 Yes, she’s not breathing. 
 She’s not moving. 
 Yes, it’s her, I’m sure. OK, see you later. 
 Lucho! 
 I can’t let you in. 
 Pierre… 
 Pierre is sending me. 
 He thinks she’ll trust me. 
 Sorry, Sandrine. 
 Let me in. 
 Mom… 
 Julie? 
 You’re leaving? 
 Mr. Lewanski is getting a bit better. 
 I can’t let you talk to him yet, but you can stay at the hospital in the meantime. 
 Thanks, but it’s pointless. 
 Where will you go? 
 I don’t know. 
 Don’t go. 
 He needs you. 
 Where will you stay? 
 Your neighborhood was evacuated. 
 You can stay at my place. 
 How do you know where I live? 
 You told me. 
 I didn’t. 
 You’ve read my medical record? 
 It’s just that… 
 After what happened with Mr. Lewanski, I was afraid. 
 You won’t tell me anything about you. I wanted to know… 
 You know what happened to me? 
 Yes. 
 Sorry, I shouldn’t have, but… 
 Your distress, I know what it is. 
 I can help you. 
 You can recover from it. 
 You know what it is? 
 Yes. 
 I followed a patient who was assaulted too. 
 She managed to rebuild a normal life. She even could have another child. 
 What are you talking about? 
 About what happened to you in the tunnel. 
 I’m sorry, I thought… 
 I was pregnant, wasn’t I? 
 I don’t know. 
 Tell me. 
 Yes, you were pregnant. 
 You didn’t know? 
 No. 
 Ophélie? 
 Mr. Lewanski is awake. He told me about a Julie. 
 Mr. Lewanski has regained consciousness. 
 He wants to see you. 
 I’m not afraid of you. 
 Dad! 
 Ophélie told me you wanted to tell me something. 
 It’s about Louis, isn’t it? 
 Your medical record indicates… that you and your wife only had one child. 
 Paul. 
 But there’s nothing about Louis. 
 It’s because… he’s not your son, is he? 
 You adopted him? 
 Hi. 
 You’re lost? 
 What’s your name? 
 Come. We’re going home.
