 male announcer : Previously on  The Returned...  
 He got out! 
 [screaming] 
 Do you know how stupid you are? Do you? 
 Tony : Maybe he was just hunting. 
 Louise : Hunting what? 
 Henry : I know who you are. 
 You killed my mom. You killed me. 
 Hello, Henry. 
 Tell them who you are. She's Camille. 
 She's not my cousin. She's my sister. 
 Lena, you're not making any sense. 
 You shouldn't be out of the hospital. 
 Lena : Why don't you tell them why I was in the hospital? 
 She wants me dead like her. 
 Lena? 
 Lena?

 Bag her. I'm resuming compressions. 
 She's flatlined. No pulse. 
 Stay with us, Lucy. Come on. 
 Liz : She's catatonic. She's in defib. 
 Body temp 92. Blood pressure dropping.

 Time of death: 2:26.

 Pupillary reflexes are good. Brain function's normal. 
 What's her BP? 
 Liz? 
 110 over 60. 
 Is that good? 
 For someone we thought was clinically dead? 
 Yeah, that's pretty good. 
 What happened? Why am I here? 
 Someone attacked you. 
 You were stabbed. 
 When they brought you in, you'd lost so much blood that you slipped into a coma. 
 An hour ago, you went into sudden cardiac arrest. 
 Your heart stopped. 
 I was stabbed?

 Jack : If I knew where she was going, I wouldn't be calling the police. 
 Yes, I understand she's an adult. 
 Let me say it one more time. 
 My daughter is hurt, and she left the hospital. 
 Thank you. All right. 
 [line trilling] 
 Hi, it's Lena. 
 Leave me a message, and I'll call you back probably. 
 Honey, it's me again. 
 I know you're upset, but you have to call me back. 
 We're all very worried about you, okay? 
 I love you. 
 It's not like she's dead or anything. 
 Lena's fine. 
 I can feel her. 
 Like we used to. 
 Remember that winter that you took us all sledding in Silver Springs? 
 Lena broke her ankle, and I felt it. 
 Mom and I were still on the top of the mountain, but I knew she was hurt. 
 Fine, don't believe me. 
 No one's saying we didn't believe you, honey. 
 It happened the day of the accident too. 
 I felt her right before. 
 What do you mean, you felt her? 
 She wasn't sick that day. 
 She was with Ben having s*x. 
 You guys are so clueless. 
 Camille? 
 Why was Lena running away from you last night? 
 Did... 
 Did you do something? 
 Claire. 
 You think I hurt her? 
 That she's gone because of me? 
 Camille. 
 What if Lena's right? 
 What if Camille isn't who she used to be? 
 Camille is our daughter. 
 So is Lena. 
 [keys jingle] 
 [birds chirping]

 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Adam. 
 It's okay. You're safe. 
 You're safe. 
 Where am I? 
 My cabin. 
 Look, I found you passed out by the river. 
 Just take it easy. 
 [whimpers] 
 Look, I was gonna take you to the hospital, but... it looks like you've already been, and I figured... 
 I figured you left for a reason. 
 Look, I couldn't just leave you out in the woods, so I brought you here. 
 [sighs] 
 [breathing unsteadily] 
 What happened to your back? 
 It's a long story. 
 Do you have any aspirin or... or whiskey? 
 It hurts like hell. 
 No. 
 I have something better though. Just wait here. 
 I remember leaving the Dog Star. 
 [sighs] 
 I remember walking. 
 Then what? 
 Well, the doctors said I was found in the tunnel under the highway, but I don't remember being there. 
 I don't remember anything else. 
 What about him? 
 Does he look familiar? 
 Yeah. 
 I met him at the Dog Star. 
 He was looking for a girl who used to work there. 
 Is he the person who attacked you? 
 [sighs] 
 I don't... 
 I don't remember. 
 But it could be him. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 We'll talk more later. 
 You just get some rest now. 
 Doc? 
 Stay here. 
 [door closes] 
 [eerie whispering] 
 Did you hear that? 
 Hear what? 
 Nothing. Never mind. 
 What are the chances of her getting her memories back after something like this? 
 Something like this? 
 I've never seen something like this. 
 No one has. 
 There's no medical precedent. 
 Three hours ago, this girl was dead. 
 And now? 
 She's fine. 
 All right. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah.

 Can I help you? 
 I'm Claire Winship. 
 Lena's mom. 
 Oh, Mrs. Winship. 
 Sorry, I'm, like, half asleep. 
 May I come in? 
 Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. 
 So how's Lena? 
 I mean, we were really worried about her last night. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Lena never came home. 
 She's not answering her phone. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, she was saying some pretty crazy sh1t. 
 Guess she was kind of out of it, painkillers and all. 
 What happened to her back? 
 The doctors aren't sure. 
 She should be in the hospital. 
 Did you call Ben? 
 Ben hasn't heard from her. 
 Is there someone new maybe? 
 Somebody I'm not thinking of? 
 A boyfriend? 
 Well, there isn't, like, one. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, Lena... sh... she knows a lot of different guys. 
 But last night, I didn't see her with anyone. 
 Sorry. 
 [birds chirping] 
 What is it? 
 Nettles mostly, some ground-up whitebark pine and a bunch of other stuff. 
 It's my ma's recipe. 
 Okay, this is gonna hurt. 
 But it'll make it better. 
 Mm. 
 Trust me. 
 Okay. 
 Do you live here by yourself? 
 Um, I used to live with my ma and my brother, but my ma died. 
 And your brother? 
 He did something I can't forgive. 
 I had a sister. 
 I wasn't good to her either. 
 What happened? 
 I did something unforgivable too. 
 
 
 
 [somber music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I think that's why this is happening to me. 
 I should be dead. 
 Me too. 
 But we're not. We're here. 
 Maybe it's not too late to be different. 
 Hey. I got your message. 
 Did you find Victor? 
 No. 
 But we picked up a homeless woman we think may've been with him. 
 Witnesses saw them together at the diner. 
 She skipped out on the check, so we picked her up this morning. 
 W... what about Victor? 
 She says he walked off while she was in the restroom. 
 You don't think she did something to him? 
 She seems off but not violent. 
 Look, she says she's George Goddard's wife. 
 George Goddard's wife died 29 years ago. 
 She's probably off her meds, but she does seem to know a lot about him. 
 George was a patient of yours, right? 
 I was thinking maybe you could talk to her a little, get her to open up. 
 If she does know where Victor went, maybe she'll tell you. 
 [door closes] 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Julie. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 A shrink? 
 I'm not that kind of doctor. 
 May I sit down? 
 Do you have any food? 
 I am starving. 
 I was George's doctor. 
 I saw pictures of you in his house. 
 So then you believe me? 
 That I am who I say I am? 
 Hmm. 
 George said you died in the flood. 
 Do you remember that? 
 [sniffs, clears throat] 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I remember the sound mostly. 
 It was like a strong wind, but there was no wind. 
 And then there was the water. 
 Oh, it was black as tar. 
 A stew of sludge. 
 Broken trees. Glass. 
 Ugh, floating cars. 
 [sighs] 
 Yep. 
 It felt like the whole world was being swallowed up. 
 And the little boy, why were you with him yesterday? 
 He's like me. 
 Victor died in the flood too? 
 Hmm, you mean Henry? 
 No, he died before that. 
 Do you know how? 
 Some men broke into his house looking to rob the place. 
 That was terrible. 
 Killed his mother, and then they killed him. 
 How is this possible? 
 The more pertinent question is "why." 
 There has to be a reason for us being here, right? 
 How do you know if you're dead? 
 There's only one way to find out. 
 You don't seriously believe any of that, do you? 
 Look at me. 
 That woman met Victor at the Triple C two days ago. 
 She doesn't know anything about him. 
 She's crazy. 
 What if she's not? 
 What are you saying? That she's dead? 
 Maybe she and Victor aren't the only ones. 
 What? You mean you? 
 Hey, I was there, okay? 
 You fought like hell, and you survived. 
 That man didn't kill you. 
 You don't get it. 
 It would be a relief to find out that I'm like her. 
 It would explain why I haven't been able... to feel my life. 
 Can you feel that? 
 [birds chirping] 
 Come with me. I want to show you something.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Richard and I grew up together. 
 We dropped out of school and went on the road together to see the country, to... to have adventures. 
 We made it as far as Caldwell before we ran out of money. 
 Richard said it would be easy. 
 Nobody was supposed to be home. 
 Your mother was reading a book in the living room when we came through the back door. 
 I had no idea he was gonna do... what he did. 
 And he told me to go search the house, and that's... that's when I found you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I brought you out here to show you that the man who killed your mother, who killed you, he's dead now. 
 And he died a slow and horrible death from cancer. 
 It took... it took five years to eat him up. 
 Henry, I've spent the last 29 years of my life trying to live... trying to make up for that night. 
 I've devoted myself to trying to... help others. 
 But I see now that maybe that's not enough. 
 Maybe that's why... you've come back.

 I am asking for your forgiveness, Henry. 
 But I understand if you can't give it.

 You just sit and watch her get drunk and go home with strangers?

 She can do whatever she wants to.

 Voices in my head, whispering things, scary things, things I don't want to hear. 
 I don't expect you to believe me. 
 He was supposed to be at your baseball game. 
 He told your mom he was tied up at work. 
 The truth was he was at the bar. 
 He said there was ice on the road... but really he was drunk.

 And he wants me to tell you...

 He's scared for you.
