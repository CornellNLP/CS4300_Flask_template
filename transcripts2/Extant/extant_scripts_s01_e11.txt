 Molly:  I went to space on a 13-month solo mission. I didn't come home alone. My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich. His name is Ethan. He's the prototype. This is a story about earth. 
 Ethan! 
 A story about family. A story about surviving. 
 Previously on  Extant...  We received a distress call from the Aruna Station. We believe there are no survivors. KATIE: Dad? I'm gonna die up here. What kind of father... sends his daughter into harm's way like that, Alan? SPARKS: What does he want? YOUNG KATIE: He wants out. If you take him, I can come, too. Mommy. SPARKS: She's real. My wife is in danger. Perhaps it will be safer for Ethan to join us here. Mr. Yasumoto doesn't want us to leave this place. I need you to go find Julie, and tell her to get you out of the building. ETHAN: I need to find Julie. We're in trouble. I can take you to her. We have lost our souls to machines. We need a reckoning. Starting right here. Meet Dr. Mason. Dr. Mason is an expert on theories of extraterrestrial life. (bird chirping) You had better stop this car. (tires screeching) This is for your own good. Your own good. You want to meet your son? (alarm sounding) Tell me what to do. BEN: Start with your access code. MOLLY: Something's wrong. Harmon. Oh, God. Oh, God. The baby's not here. Molly, it's getting stronger. You have to stop it. Harmon! Harmon! Harmon! (Odin laughs) Hey, why don't you get that game you keep bragging about? See how good you really are. Oh, I'm good. Oh, yeah? I'll be the judge of that. Can I help you? Uh, I was just headed to the kitchen. Wanted to get myself some tea. I can call the chef. He can send it up here. I don't mind walking. Oh, it's no trouble at all, sir. Are you sure? I'm positive. Is there anything else that you need? No, no. I was just thirsty. (conversation continues indistinctly) (Molly crying) Harmon? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Molly. Okay. We've got to get out of here. Who was he? Dr. Mason. One of Yasumoto's scientists. He came here to help me get the baby. Yasumoto? Hideki Yasumoto? Yeah. He was your silent investor. He was behind all of it. The Aruna mission, Claypool... And you're working with him? Well, I thought I was. We'd better get out of here before he wakes up. What are you doing? Something terrible is about to happen. (phone rings) Dr. Mason. MOLLY: Call your men off. Do not send them after Sparks. Tell them to stand down. I'm afraid I can't do that, Molly. Sparks has the baby. We can't let him get away. This was not our deal. If you send them in there to try to take the baby like this, they will die. Just like at Claypool. I'm sorry. I can't wait any longer. Okay. We have to get to Sparks before they do. On your knees! On your knees. Now! Hands where I can see them. Sir? They've apprehended Molly Woods. What about the Offspring? Closing in now. We have a sniper in place, ready to take out Sparks on your signal. Not until the Offspring is safe. Are you all right? Anya, I killed him. I killed Kryger. Like you said, we have to make our peace with it. We need to find a safe place. Somewhere we can lie low until we can be sure no one's looking for us. Alan. MAN (over radio): Eyes on vehicle. Closing in now. You'd better stop them now. Ma'am. He'll think you're gonna hurt him. Take me to him! I can help you! Ma'am! Not another word. Please step out of the vehicle, sir. Open the back door. Slowly. I don't think you want me to do that. Open the door. (multiple shots firing) MAN (over radio): Gunfire! Friendly! Friendly! Who's shooting?! MAN 2: Who's in contact?! (gunfire continues over radio) Okay, look, listen, if you keep me here, he'll come for you next. He'll do anything to protect me. I'm his mother. (gunfire continues, men grunting) Sanders, stay in position! I don't want to die. That's an order, Sanders! (gunfire continues over radio) (bullets ricocheting) How'd you get here? We tracked Anya. When we got to the cabins, it... looked like you were in a trance. What happened to you? I got close to the baby. Sparks told me I could see him, and then, all of a sudden, I was in this... this dream world. But it was different than all the other times. Ten years ago, I got into a car accident with my boyfriend, but he died. I was pregnant at the time. I know about the accident. Right. Well, in this dream, I was with the baby that I lost. And I looked down, and I saw him in an incubator. And he was so little, and... and I touched him, and I-- and I felt his heartbeat. And then, something happened, and he was in distress, and... and I had to save him. But this time, I actually could. He's creating an entire fictional world now. He's getting stronger, Molly. Oh, my God. (phone rings) Yes. You got all of your men killed. I sent my men for your protection. For his protection. Well, he's done everything in his power to get away from you. So, I'm done. Whatever it is you want with him, I am not gonna help you. Unfortunately, you may not have a choice. You still need to bring me the baby. Oh, really? Why? I imagine you'd like to speak to your family again. You can interpret that however you like. (tones chime) (clicking, hissing) (clicking, hissing) John. I didn't see you there. Sorry to interrupt. How is Ethan? Well, he's been asking all these questions I don't have answers to. I've shut him down until we, uh, we're out of this mess. Curiosity is part of the human experience. Doesn't that run counter to your mission statement for Humanichs? Well, this is one experience I don't want him to have. Let my staff know if there is anything you need. Thank you. Run translation, Japanese to English. Running translation. (talking in Japanese) VERDISIGN: It's been too long between doses. The aging process is accelerating without warning. Prepare the final dose. The vial can only sustain you for a matter of weeks. Without a synthetic reproduction... Our efforts to synthesize the substance have failed. Excuse me, sir. Yeah. Your tea. Thank you. Sir. It's not a choice. Even if we get the baby from Sparks, he doesn't want anything to do with Yasumoto. He needs to know that he's gonna be with someone who's gonna protect him. What about the ISEA? The ISEA? Let me... We can't go to the ISEA. I don't trust anybody there. There's one person there I know for sure is clean-- Ryan Jackson. He's acting director since Sparks disappeared. Sparks kept a very tight circle of people in the know. Jackson wasn't one of them. He knows nothing about this? Nothing. We'll need the baby as proof, but then Jackson can help us expose Yasumoto. You'll get your baby and your family. Hey, isn't that Sparks' car? Kern. She's unconscious, but she's breathing. I'll call an ambulance. Do you live around here? Down the road? Why were you here? The lady lets me play. The lady at the counter? She lets me play in the boxes in the back. Only when they're closed. Do you remember what happened? I know you're scared, honey. But we're gonna make sure you get home, okay? The other lady wanted the car. What lady? We're closed. I'm gonna need your car. (chuckles) There's a phone in the back, if you'd like to call AAA. No. I need your car now. Listen, I don't want any trouble. If you're reaching for a weapon under there, you should know this won't end well for you. I'll just take your keys. I'm calling the cops. I wouldn't do that. (crackling) (woman cries out, body thuds) She left in the lady's brown car. Brown car. Okay, um... Do you remember anything about that car? Did it have two doors, four doors? The ambulance is on its way. And they're sending a squad car. We have to go. Do you want to come with me and wait outside until they get here? Is that the brown car? (beeping) (tones chime) (clicking) (hissing) Sir. We searched the office. I don't know how that boy is missing. I have a team sweeping the tower, and there's no sign of him. I need a team in the office right now. I took you in. Made you my guest. You made us your prisoners. You-you put my wife in danger. The danger she is in is entirely of her own creation. I was trying to help her. Check the safe. The vial is still there, sir. Where's Molly? Keep him quiet. Where's Julie? I... left a message for her. She'll call us back. Hey, can I tell you a secret? Yes. (sighs) Actually... I don't know if I should tell you. Tell me. It's not a very nice secret. I want to know. Yesterday, Julie said that your dad was thinking about shutting you down. Maybe that's why he was arguing with Mr. Yasumoto. I don't think so. He's worried you're too advanced. He built you to learn like kids your age, but you're way smarter than that. You're even smarter than he is. He said I was growing up. Yeah, but human kids don't grow up at eight years old. But... No, maybe I shouldn't have told you. You're probably right. You look tired. Do you need a flip? No, I don't think so. Well, maybe I should just check, just to be sure. I guess. Okay. I'm sorry what I said about your dad, I just... ...don't want anything bad happening to you. (beeping) I'm running low on power. You're okay. Ethan? (sighs) What if somebody saw us? We have to be more careful. We have to stay calm. The police will be looking for the car. There could be drone footage. We can't hide forever. That's enough. Sweetie? You want something to eat? No. We are part of something extraordinary here. And you said it yourself-- there are consequences. I came all the way here because I trusted you. You need to trust me now. Daddy? Whose side are you on? You have to choose. 
 
 Well, that's the car. So, this must be the place. Molly, wait. What does he want from you? Every time your baby has created an alternate reality, he's had an agenda. At the roadblock and at Claypool, he turned the black ops against each other to protect himself. He gave Sparks a vision of his daughter, and Sparks helped him escape. And when got near to him, he put you in a fantasy world. So what does he need from you? I think he's frightened. Of what? He showed me that baby for a reason, okay? Maybe he wants me to see him as that child. In the fantasy, I saved the baby. Maybe that's his message. He's alone and-and afraid in a world that he just doesn't understand. And he needs his mother to save him. And maybe he knows how badly you want to be a mother. He knows everything about us. Who we've lost, what we care about. Maybe he's manipulating you for some other reason. You don't know that. You're right, I don't. And I really hope I'm wrong. I'm gonna go to the office, and see if I can figure out what room he's in. Hindus believe Vishnu entered the womb of a human woman. Buddha entered the world as his mother's dream. A white elephant. All the great storytellers speak of divine birth. Where is my wife? There is very little room for Joseph in Mary's story. But that doesn't mean he isn't necessary. You will play a part in what comes next. What are you talking about? Wh-What's coming next? The beginning of a new world. And it all began with Molly. She brought him here. No, you won't live to see it. You're dying. And you're running out of whatever it is that's keeping you alive. (quiet laugh) Molly will bring me what I need. Ready to finish what we started? Walk. Toward the bathroom. If you make me do that, I can't promise he won't hurt you. Open it. Open it! (grunts) (gasps) They left me. He's gone. It's over. Dad? I'm gonna die up here. (crying): I just wanted to... (thumping nearby) Whatever you do, do not recover the ship. I repeat-- do not recover the ship! You covered up your own daughter's death and sent our people into harm's way. Ryan. You have to understand how powerful that being is. The things it allows you to see. Please, Molly. Losing Katie and then to see her again. To touch her. To be, to be able to hear her laugh. You just can't understand that. I understand exactly what it is to lose a child, Alan. Especially when it's taken from you. Where is he? I told Anya we had to stop. That we were crossing a line we could never come back from. You crossed that line a long time ago. And I'm trying to make it right. Please, Molly, Anya wouldn't listen. She told me that I had to choose. And then she took off with him. Where are they going? If I knew, I would tell you. When did this start? As far as I know, the Aruna was the first mission where Yasumoto co-opted Sparks. Let me assure you I'm gonna do everything in my power to make this right. Well, Sparks is right about how powerful it is. We've both seen firsthand what it's capable of. But he's never tried to hurt me. He's only ever tried to protect me. So, when we find him, I think it has to be me... alone. Well, he's gone to great lengths to get here. If we are gonna find him, we have to figure out why he's here and what he wants. We can keep pushing, but it... it sounds like Sparks has no idea where his wife has gone. Forget Sparks. It's Yasumoto who sent the Aruna to those coordinates. Somehow he knew contact was possible. We have to find out what else he knows. He has your family. How do we get him to talk? We give him exactly what he wants. Sir, you have a call. Molly? I have him. I'm ready to make the exchange. How did you do it? I followed Sparks to the motel where he was keeping him. I have both of them. Tell him. SPARKS: She's telling the truth. Bring my family to Jefferson Garage on 15th Street, third level. Come alone. How can I trust you? I've got something you want. And you've got my family. One hour. VERDISIGN: Incoming call, Odin. Odin, what's up? Hey. Yeah, I'm glad I caught you. I, um... I'm at John and Molly's house with Ethan. Apparently John and Yasumoto had some kind of argument? (beeps) An argument? What are you talking about? I don't know. Um, Ethan was looking for you, and, uh... John said he wanted you to get him out of the building. Did he say why? No. And I couldn't find you, so I took him home. Okay. Okay, yeah. I'll, I'll come by now. Stay there. Okay, see you soon. (beeps) What happened? You just woke up. (tires screeching) Are you okay? Where's Ethan? He's safe. I got him out of the building. Where is he? In the van. Go ahead. See for yourself. Walk. Stop. No! No! What are you doing? You don't have the baby. If you did, I'd be dead right now for threatening your life. Maybe he knows you're bluffing. I'm not bluffing. Wait! I'll drop it. You need this to stay alive. How did you get it? Check your safe. See if what's in there is real. You couldn't. Are you willing to take that chance? Place the weapon on the ground. I thought I was gonna lose you. But you came back. I told you I would. Julie called. She's at home with Ethan. I'm gonna go see them. I know you have to stay here, see things through. It's almost over. I promise. Hey. Oh, hey, John. What's going on? What happened with Yasumoto? Uh, it's a long story. You mind if I tell you some other time? Hey, Ethan. How are you? What's going on with him? I don't know. He was fine this afternoon. I think he's probably just tired. I wouldn't worry too much. MOLLY: Do you know why he's here? You put this whole thing in motion. How did you know I would make contact, and how did you even know where to look? My baby is out there somewhere, scared and alone, with a power we can't even begin to understand. And the only way we're going to find him is to know why he came here and what he wants. You're dying. Why do you think my baby can save you? I don't have an illness, Molly. I have the terminal condition we're all cursed with. How much do you know about Claypool Industries? I know you used it to funnel money through Sparks to put the Aruna in harm's way. That's not the whole story. I used to work for Claypool. Many years ago. I was married. She was pregnant with my child. We were poor. I was a miner. The owner of the company, Joseph Claypool, One day... ...I was mining a new impact site. I fell into a deep hole and was trapped. (rumbling) There was no rescue effort, no attempt to save my life. I came to terms with death. I prayed for it, welcomed it. But I was not alone down there. The meteor, more precious than anything I'd ever mined before... Each day, I expected to die. But strangely, I survived. My injuries healed. (tapping sound) A month after being swallowed by the earth... (men's voices clamoring) ...I walked out of it healed. Days later, I came back for the rest of the substance that kept me alive. That's what this is? Claypool gave me a stake in the company to buy my silence. Eventually, with the help of the substance, I outlived him. I outlived them all. I spent the money on research to discover the origin of that rock. It took 25 years to find the rest of that asteroid and its orbit. Another 29 years before we landed on the moon. That's a long time to wait. Over 140 years. And the deeper we explored in space, the closer we got to that asteroid, until finally we sent the Aruna. We found something far more extraordinary than the substance. We made contact with the architect of eternal life. So the Aruna and Kryger and me... all of this was because you were afraid to die? We were both chosen, Molly. I found the rock... ...you brought this life force here to earth. And we want the same thing. The promise of a life without the consequence of death. Your child offers that chance. You could be with Marcus again. Isn't that what you've always wanted? If it wasn't an illusion, but a reality... wouldn't you do anything? Where's Sparks? D wing. Richards is debriefing him. Why? Molly! (gasps) (door opens) MOLLY: Sparks. You'd never let Katie go. I should have known that. You're too late. It's already done. What did you do? What did I do? Shouldn't you be asking yourself the same question? Any word from mission control? BEN: No word, Sean. And they received my message? BEN: It seems our sat comm is down. Running a systems check now. Thanks. (whirring noises) FRENCH ASTRONAUT: This is the Triomphe trying to contact the Seraphim. Come in. Hey. Hi. Yes. This is Sean Glass on the Seraphim Station. We are requesting to dock with your station. Has this been scheduled with mission control? No. We just performed a 5-8-4 retrieval. 5-8-4? Is it one of ours? It appears to be an ISEA-issue craft. We'd like to dock with your station. Okay. I'll guide you in. Ben, initiate docking protocol. BEN: Initiating. (computer chimes) Sean Glass? Hi. Yes. Welcome. Sorry. Haven't had any human contact in about a month. So, you found an escape pod? We towed it in. There was only a faint signal. No signs of life. Until we opened it and then... well... She said she's one of yours. Sean? Katie? (footsteps echoing)
