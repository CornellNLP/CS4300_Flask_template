 Molly:  I went to space on a 13-month solo mission. I didn't come home alone. My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich. His name is Ethan. He's the prototype. This is a story about earth. 
 Ethan! 
 A story about family. A story about surviving. 
 Previously on  Extant...  It's a pleasure to have you back, Molly. You were missed. Her husband John gave  a presentation to your board today, but was denied funding. A gesture from you could put us closer to the family. KERN: He passed away before I came on board. Were you close? MOLLY: Yeah. He was a good guy. I'm Gordon Kern. The new deputy director. I'm asking for some time. As my friend. Molly, this goes straight to Director Sparks... I can't lie. We have to go right now. No! Ethan! He's changed. And so have you. That's the consequence of our family being apart for so long. It takes time to reconnect. Well, I'm trying. It feels like you're pulling away from us. (thumping) (thumping continues) (thumping continues) (thumping continues) (thumping, tumbling, clattering) Hey. Everything all right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm, you know, just... a little fuzzy, still. Here. 140, on the dot. Oh... ooh... Oh, it smells good. You know the hardest thing about being in space? The coffee's awful. That's the hardest thing? (laughs) Absolutely. Wow. Okay. Where's Ethan? Uh, still in bed. Okay, well, I'm gonna start breakfast and you get him dressed, okay? On it. I knew you wouldn't have time to go shopping for Andrew's party. What's Ethan giving him? A video game: Space Invasion. Nice. Thanks for doing that. Sure. Hey, whatever you do, stay away from the cake. I'm taking you to a late lunch at Endre's. Uh, already been arranged. First date table, right on the patio, chocolate soufflé. What's the occasion? We have a lot to celebrate. Your safe return, my new lab. What do you think? I think that's great. I took care of this for you, too. Party at the museum at 10:00, you bring Ethan to me by 1:00, I take him to meet Yasumoto, by that point we'll definitely both need a drink. And that's where lunch at Endre's comes in. It's everything in here with the reminders. I better get going. Hey, hey. Mm-hmm? Got to look sharp. That's better... What does "look sharp" mean? This is looking sharp. Bye. Behave. (laughs) Well... guess it's just us chickens. Sam. Alan. Good morning. What can I do for you? Molly's results. Her reentry physical. Any idea when we're gonna hear from the lab? Well, we should have them by tonight. Tomorrow at the latest. I'm sure she'll be fine. You'll have them as soon as I have them. Thank you. Sure. (elevator bell dings) Morning, Julie. Good morning. I got you coffee. Molly's home. Made a pot. Great. Welcome to our new home. What do you think? (chuckles) Right? Programming is here, already up and writing our new protocols. Manufacture and Assembly finally have instant access to the printers and the learning centers. What time did you get here? 5:00. Sharing is caring. Hey, Tops. Band's back together. Yes, it is. (chuckles) Hey, flesh printer goes by me. Our station is here. There have to be some perks to being in charge, right? From your garage to that wonder of a warehouse to... this? What? I'm just wondering what you said to Yasumoto to turn it around. I'd like to know that myself. Ms. Dodd. (quiet chuckle) Wow. When did you get so good at this? I played a lot with Dad and Julie while you were gone. Do you want to try? Yeah. Sure. Okay. Oh, man, I forgot how hard this was. (groans): Oh. I'm sorry. (chuckles) Dad says you have to be patient. Yeah. Do you want to try again? I have to go get ready for Andrew's party. I like the museum. Me, too. When I was your age, that was my favorite place in the whole world. But space is your favorite place now. Right? Nope. It's right here. With you and Dad. Countdown to liftoff. T-minus 30. JOHN:  A Humanich is born here. They live their first few years as a program, growing and learning, much the same way we do. The same way your daughter did. My daughter didn't spend her first three years in a box. No, but her brain spent that time writing its own sort of program. And that's exactly what we're doing here. We allow a brain to write its programming just like a human would. And when it's developed enough, we put him in a physical body. Or her. Or her, exactly. I-I hope you can see there's really nothing to fear here. The rise of the machines. Help me. Help me. (Julie giggles) I'm not worried about the robots destroying us, Dr. Woods. I think we're perfectly capable of doing that ourselves. I don't understand. Let me ask you a question. If your machines become so human that we establish genuine connection with them, what does that do to the one we have with each other? I don't know that that's a reasonable concern. (scoffs) Well, then you should spend some time with my daughter. She's closer to our home Verdisign system than she is with me. Well, Humanichs are different. They're still machines. They can't give back. Then you should spend some time with my son... I think he could convince you otherwise. I didn't come here to be convinced, Dr. Woods. I came here because, for some inexplicable reason, Mr. Yasumoto went around the board to fund your project. I came to tell you face-to-face, I don't intend to take that lying down. You don't have to. The war's over. I won. Thank you for the tour. Don't worry about her. We've got Yasumoto. We've got much more than that. We've got Ethan. (thumping) (thumping continues) (groans) (grunts, gasps) (groans) It's okay. It's okay. (thud in distance) His process speeds are picking up. Uh, he's going to the Natural History Museum with his mom. Just excited. Probably a lot to take in. Mom? Mom? Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay. Why don't you go join them. Go on. (elephant bellows, trumpets) ♪ ♪ (growling) (elephant bellows) (kids gasping, elephant trumpets) (trumpeting, bellowing, growling) (trumpeting) (kids exclaiming) (chattering happily) Molly, thank you so much. Oh. Andrew really wanted Ethan to come. Wow, look at you. Oh, right, you didn't know. (chuckles) A lot can happen in 13 months. I heard that Ethan's going to school soon. He's got orientation tomorrow. He's so excited. Was it hard to get him in? Uh, well, you know, John's been working with the school. (splashing sounds) Ooh. (kids chattering happily) Hey. They're going to the Mariana Trench. Can I go, too? I'll take them. Okay. Thank you. MOLLY:  Thanks for coming. It wasn't easy. Sparks is breathing down my neck about your results. So what happened? I don't know. I passed out, okay? I had this pounding in my head, and then I had this pain in my stomach and then I... I don't know, I had some kind of vision... Molly, we have to tell Sparks. No, not yet. I don't understand. I don't know if I can trust him. Why not? Harmon is alive. What are you talking about? He didn't kill himself. I saw him last night. I was taking out the trash and there he was... he told me not to trust the ISEA or anybody. The ISEA? But they're family. Why? I don't know. But he's so scared of 'em he actually faked his own death. What the hell is wrong with the guy? There were abnormalities in his brain scans, some sort of neurovirus. That he got from where? The Seraphim? I don't know. Okay. Well, what do you know? I compared your brain scans to his. And you have the same abnormalities. Molly, whatever happened to Harmon Kryger is happening to you, too, and that scares me. Could a hysterical pregnancy actually show up as a positive in my blood? I mean, could the abnormalities in my brain actually cause that? This is not in your head. You are pregnant. I tried for ten years. I don't get pregnant. But you are. (sighs) Okay. I need an ultrasound. I need to know for sure. Okay. I just cannot put you in the system. I-I have to find a place where... I can do this off the books. Okay. Molly, we can't find Ethan. I turned around and he was gone. Where was he? Marine Bio Hall. Go. Go. Please step back. The Chain of Evolution is not an interactive display. I see you are interested in the Neanderthal. I can tell you more about him, if you like. Okay. Neanderthal Man went extinct about 30,000 years ago. "Extinct"? "Extinct" is to no longer exist. Why did they go extinct? Extinction happens for many reasons. In almost all cases, strong species survive and the weak ones die. It's called survival of the fittest. What happened to the Neanderthal? Homo sapiens came to Eurasia, where the Neanderthals lived,  and they were better able to survive because they were stronger and smarter. What's a Homo sapien? Homo sapien is the name of the species You, for example, are a Homo sapien. No. I'm not. I apologize for my mistake. What species are you? MOLLY: Ethan! There you are. This is my mom. I see you are interested in the Neanderthal. I can tell you more about him, if you like. No, thank you. Come on. Let's go. Bye. Have a pleasant afternoon. Ethan, you know you shouldn't run off like that. I was worried. I know. Dad said the same thing, that I'm not supposed to wander off. Do we have to tell him? No. We don't have to tell him. Like a secret? Sort of. Dad says secrets are mean. Well, they can be. But sometimes people keep secrets so that other people don't worry about things that they don't need to worry about. Like Dad would be really worried if he knew you ran off. And he'd be really worried if he knew I fell down. Why would that worry him? Well... he might think I'm sick. Are you sick? No. I'm just getting back to Earth, that's all. Are you weak? No. So I'll keep your secret if you keep mine. Okay. Oh. (chuckles) Good deal. Let's go. (rock music playing) (music cutting in and out, power buzzing) What's going on, Ben? BEN: I'm detecting interference from the solar flare. Am I gonna be losing the pleasure of your company? BEN: Harmon, there's an energy surge in sector three. Flare-related? (power whirrs and buzzes, shutting down) (alarm buzzing) What's going on, Ben? Ben? (hatch clicks, hisses) 
 
 Mother? Hey. What do you think? Wow. I mean, this is unbelievable. Amazing what a couple of billion buys. JULIE: Hey, Rabbit. Hey, Molly. Hi, Julie. How was the party? Great. Hey, bud. Want to see your new arm? I'm gonna be big. I'll hook it up, let you pick your own nose. (others chuckle) VERDISIGN: John, sorry to interrupt. It's time for your meeting with Mr. Yasumoto. Let's go, buddy. Ethan. You're gonna be great. Wish us luck. Good luck. (chuckles) Good luck. See you at lunch. Okay. Well, you know what, congratulations because... I know. It's-it's so crazy, right? (both chuckle quietly) It's so great for Ethan to have you back. God, 13 months. That's such a long time. Yeah. But, you know what, I'm glad to be back. Well, I could show you around... Actually, I have something that I really have to do, so, um... rain check? Sure. Uh, Ethan told me he had so much fun with you while I was gone, and... Well, thank you. It's no problem. See you. Bye. Do you like dinosaurs? Yes, sir. He spent the morning at the Natural History Museum. Are you interested in science? My mom and dad are both scientists. Yes, I know. Very good ones. How do you like your new facilities? They're perfect. In every way. I'm glad. Thank you again. I feel like I should mention I had a visit from one of your board members today. Ms... Ms. Femi Dodd. She seemed troubled. Ms. Dodd doesn't share my optimistic view of the future. Let me ask you, Dr. Woods: Ten years from now, or 20, what do you see happening with Humanichs? I see them living and working side by side with humans. No different from us. He really is astonishing. How is your wife since her return? Molly? She's, uh... she's good. Still recovering. It was a long mission. YASUMOTO: I'd love to meet her. We'll have to arrange a dinner. And, of course, you'll bring Ethan. That would be great. Dr. Woods. (elevator bell dings) Hey, Ben, I need access to security footage from the Seraphim, please. Sure, Molly. What part of your mission would you like to view? Uh, not mine. Harmon Kryger's. What is your specific request? There was a solar flare on his mission. Take me to the time right before the flare hit and run it through, please. Just a moment. I'm sorry. Access to that footage is above your clearance. What about the experiment cams? Do I have access to those? Yes. Okay. Take me to Lab Cam B. Same time frame, please. Loading footage. Fast-forward. Play. Take me to Lab Cam A. Same time frame. BEN: Loading. What is he barricading there? BEN: I'm not sure. What's behind that door? BEN: I'm sorry, Molly. I've been directed to terminate this session. (beeping) MALE VOICE: Attention. Your tether has become dislodged. Your medical information can no longer be monitored. (tires screech) Molly! Get in! Come on. Get in. Get in the car. Get in the car. We followed the signal of her monitoring tether. She left it in the bathroom. She's gone? And before she left, she used our system to access footage from Kryger's mission. Do you want me to bring her back in? Let's give her a little more rope. I gotta call my husband. He's been waiting. Phones don't work out here. It's part of the appeal. Okay. What is going on? I tried to tell them what I saw. At first I thought, well, that they just... they just don't believe me. But it's more than that. They said I was schizophrenic. Crazy. I started to think maybe I was crazy. I tried to access footage from your mission. Ben locked me out. So what is it they don't want me to see? I saw someone. Mother? (latches clank) (grunts with effort) (power whirrs down and up) (gasping) N-No... No. (air hissing) (air hisses) Mother. No. (latches clanking) No. ELECTRONIC VOICE: Airlock evacuation initiated. No. No. ELECTRONIC VOICE: Door armed. KRYGER:  They made me see her again, just like she was  before she died. I know it was real. I know what I saw, and I know what I did. Harmon... Sam compared our brain scans. They're both showing the same abnormalities. That could be the reason for our visions. What caused the abnormalities? Did-did they expose us to radiation? Did they... did they dose us with something? What? I don't know why they would do something like that. To test the effects of deep space on the body. To see how we perform under stress. We thought we were doing experiments? We were the experiments. Well, we need proof. Okay? Because right now, all we have is our stories. Look what my story got me. They'll bug your phone, they'll follow you, they'll force you into quarantine, and if you tell anybody, nobody will believe you. Not even the people you love. (indistinct conversations) Kryger saw his mother? Yup. She's been dead for almost 30 years. Who did you see? Marcus. (sighs) Molly. I'm so sorry. You know, what kind of experiment could they be doing where we both would see people that we loved and lost? I don't know. I really don't know. He looked exactly as he did the morning he died, before he left the house. It was real. Is that why you haven't told John? I tell John what, exactly? That, uh... I had a psychotic episode in space, or that I had a vision of my dead boyfriend and now I'm pregnant with something I can't explain? (wry laugh) I mean, really? Sam, I'm scared. That the minute I tell him, everything's gonna be different. Molly... he loves you. (sighs) So much. Yeah, but... I need to know more. (dogs barking, howling) The equipment's old, but it works. Hop up here. I'm gonna try to make you as comfortable as possible. (grunts) You good? (sighs, groans) Yeah. All right. (dogs barking in distance) Here we go. (sighs) Um, can you lift up your shirt? Yeah. (grunts) All right, just relax. This is gonna be cold. (sighs) Okay. And you are gonna feel some pressure. Okay. (tapping keys) Where are you? Here. What? See for yourself. Completely normal. 14-week-old human fetus. (heartbeat thumping) With a baby's heartbeat. (sighs): Oh. (sighs deeply) Molly. What did you do to me? I don't know what you mean. Really? Well, I'm 14 weeks pregnant. And 14 weeks ago, I was in space. Alone. Are you sure? 100%. We're really good friends, right? Yeah. Then, just, please... tell me what you did to me. (sighs) Molly... I didn't do anything. I wouldn't lie to you. The ISEA would never do something like that. I wouldn't do it to you, as a friend. Hell, I brought you into this program. You're family. Well, if you didn't do it, then who did it? If it was someone here, I'll find out. I promise you. You were supposed to protect us. (car door shuts) Molly's pregnancy changes everything. I wasn't sure when Kryger came back. His behavior was too erratic. But with Molly there can be no doubt. You think we found them? I think they're already here. If that's true... if they're here... we're way out of our depth. We have no plan for this. (sighs) One step at a time. What have we done? I'll tell you what we've done. We've honored Katie's sacrifice. This all started with your daughter, Alan. You should be proud. Hmm. (sighs) (electronic pulsing) (female voice speaking Japanese) Are you coming downstairs soon? (sighing heavily) (door closes) Look what we did. I've got leftovers. I'm not sure the soufflé can reheat. John... I'm sorry. Y... I was at the lab with Danny and then, uh, Sam came by... Why didn't you call me? I was worried. Because I couldn't, okay? That's it? I just couldn't. I'm sorry. If you're not ready to talk about what's going on with you, that's fine. If you need time, take it. You don't have to do this by yourself. You're here now. With us. I know. I'll heat you up a plate. He-he needs to know you're all right. Okay. I drew you a picture. You did? Can I see? Hmm... I put the family in the spaceship, so that they'd be safe. Safe from what? Extinction. Extinction? Where'd you learn about that? At the museum today. It's where the stronger, smarter species survive. It's okay... I kept your secret. Let's see... what else did you draw here?
