 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission. I didn't come home alone. The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen. My other child... is a lifelike android. 
 Mom? 
 He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs. These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future. But where does that leave us? Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct. What if it's our time? 
 Previously on Extant... Run! Molly : Shepherd released that virus. A lot of the hybrids have been exposed. [Coughing] My son Ahdu is dying. There are some... you cannot trust. Molly : Ares. Ahdu : And... Terra. Good night, Rabbit. Good night, Mom. You have obviously done something to his memories. I was protecting him! There are good Humanichs, and there are bad Humanichs. Lucy : My upload is going into all of those Humanichs? Lucky them. I never installed Lucy's limiters. Do you realize what you've done? Charlie : Lucy is one of the bad ones. Good-bye, Julie. What did I do? If I turn myself in... they'll release Kelsey. Shepherd : Where's Molly? You killed her. [Coughing] Richter : You exposed her to the virus. You wanted me, Toby. You got me. God, what have I done to you? [Monitor beeping rhythmically] Nate : Get her core temp down. Up the RecMesc for the pain. I need samples, full metabolic panel. I need to run the viral DNA against the database. What are we looking for? Oh, I don't know. A woman's dying of a virus she created. Maybe we're looking for a cure. Fiona : Doesn't look as if you have much time. I would steer the conversation quickly to the matter at hand. How many hybrids have survived the virus, how many there are around the world. Yes, Madam Secretary, I know what we need. Then go get it. [Door hissing open] [Door hissing, latch clicks] [Quietly]: Sorry about all the... poking and prodding. You should study me. Learn from me. What I could've been. I need to ask you some questions, you know, uh, 'cause... you're the only one who can give me answers. I gave you an answer. They're not the enemy. I can't take that on faith, Molly. So you steal John's work... to create an army of Humanichs. Machines to hurt living creatures. Soldiers, to win a war. You want war. They want peace. You're wasting your time, Toby. The human race? Not worth saving. You don't mean that. I don't have time to say things that I don't mean. You killed John, didn't you? I swear to you, I had nothing to do with John's death. You're gonna die one day, too, Toby. You should try speaking the truth. Does the soul good. I need to know how many survived... and where they went. You want answers? Well, first... there's something I want. So, I hear we have a problem. Lucy. Lucy is the problem. Care to elaborate? She overheard us talking about potentially shutting her down, and she attacked me. Well, you were talking about shutting her down. It's both human and Humanich, is it not, the will to survive? A-All due respect, I think you're missing the point, here. Lucy tried to kill a human being. Not only does that go against Humanich protocol, but it raises into question the safety of any Humanichs with her operating system. It also begs the question why you were talking about shutting her down in the first place. She was showing indications of a very defiant streak. Charlie : We wanted to nip it in the bud. Madame Secretary, I have two dozen operational Humanichs, all on standby. I want your authorization to shut them down... and to suspend activation for a thousand plus. Because they all have Lucy's programming. Yes. No virus in the history of the world has ever been 100% lethal. Did you know that? Humanichs are the ultimate solution to the hybrid question. Yeah, well, what's your solution to the Humanichs question? We have promised our allies Humanichs who will be operational and available immediately. The hybrid threat cannot be contained without them. Now, I'm not a technical person, but your concerns sound like glitches that can be fixed. So I suggest you fix them. Fast. Okay. So now what the hell do we do? We get those limiters put back on fast, and download them into all those other Humanichs before they're activated. All right. We can't screw this up again. Shepherd : Ms. Gelineau. There's something you need to know. We have Molly Woods in custody. She's dying. What? Her final wish is to see Ethan. Dying of what? Nate : We recovered the hybrid bodies for research. We're going to conduct some tests. Ethan... I'm leaving you this video log... in hopes it helps you fill in the blanks one day. You're gonna be looking for answers. You know, I still am. I tried to be a good mother, wife. Didn't always come easy. I don't know why. [Raspy breathing] My mother died when I was about your age. Your grandpa... [Inhales] Well... you know Grandpa. Quinn [distantly] : Baby girl. [Raspy breathing] [People laughing, talking] Quinn : Baby girl! Molly : Daddy? One and the same. [Laughing] Mmm! Brought you some cotton candy. [Laughs] What's happening? This is our very special day, you... are going to have the time of your life. [Maniacal laughter] Take the restraints off. Why, are we gonna play chess? No. Molly Woods has turned herself in in exchange for your release. Where is she? We're doing all we can for her. Doing all you can? You mean like releasing a virus that's killing her? Where the hell is she? In quarantine. Now listen, you were there. You saw them. What can you tell me? 'Cause I need something. Oh, you need something. I'm not telling you anything... until I see Molly. [Children shouting, laughing] Hey, let's play that Alien game first, all right? Molly : Okay. Can we? Quinn : Yeah, that's why we're here, that's what I said. Man : Good to see you. I wish Mommy was here. Oh, well, uh, she had to run some errands. Uh, but, uh, this is our special day. Wait. That's Ethan. Quinn : What's the matter? Who? Ethan, wait! [Groans] Come on, baby. We don't have very much time. Come on. Come on, baby let's go. We're going to go this way. I never meant to hurt Lucy. I don't want to hurt anyone. Ever. And you never will, Ethan. You're not like the others, like Lucy. You have humanity. And the other Humanichs, like Lucy, they don't have this? I don't think so. Ethan, when I changed your memory function, I was trying to keep you from the pain of losing your parents. Ethan, your mo... Molly is very sick. What's the matter with her? Turns out that her body went through some... pretty unusual changes after her pregnancy. What kind of changes? There are parts of the hybrids inside of her... that are making her feel more like them. Ethan, Molly may not get better, and the thing she wants the most is to see you. I'd like that. But first... there's something we need to do. You sure you're okay with this? I'm sure. All right. See you on the other side, bud. Verdisign : Root core has been accessed. Are you sure you wish to proceed? Memory download is commencing. I put the family in the space station, they'd be safe. Want to try mine? Okay. Mom! You made me drop my ice cream! Have this one. This is how my dad taught me, and I fell a lot. Dad, let go. Ethan! Did you want to teach me more? John : Ethan! Verdisign : Memory download is complete. [Sighs] It's done. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Julie. Hi, Rabbit. I need tissue, blood, bone marrow panels up now. I need matches to Molly's results. Tommy, bring up the previous viral constructs. Let's see if we missed anything there. Naomi, we're gonna take the little girl... see if there's anything different about her pathology. I'm hungry. Anyone else hungry? [Beep, door hissing open] Hey. It's me. Crazy couple of weeks, huh? You, uh... turned my world upside down, and then you gave it a good shake. But, you know what? I wouldn't change a second of it. You opened my eyes, Molly. Y-You made me see things in... myself and other people that... I never would have found on my own. That's what you do, you... you make the world see things. That's your gift. You are the bravest and strongest person... that I've ever met in my entire life. You fight this. You beat this virus. Damn it, don't you give up. People, they-they need you. I need you. I, um... got a bottle of scotch in my office. That's my drink of choice. Man [distantly, echoing] : They call it a game of chance... There is no chance. [Carnival music plays] They call it a game of chance. But here at the carnival, there is no chance. Here, everything happens for a reason. In your line of work, there are no coincidences. That's right, little lady. Quinn : Now, you leave my daughter alone. She's not interested in playing any of your games. Now, baby girl, if we linger, we gonna miss the chance to play Galactic Attack, huh? Come on. Whew, you never know what kind of characters you're gonna meet in a carnival. I guess that's part of the charm. Here we are. Quinn : Hey, what do you know about that? That's Mrs. Caber, the next-door neighbor. Um, now, baby, here. You get busy bringing these aliens back to Earth, okay? And don't you wander off now, you know? Gonna pay my respects. I don't want to be alone, Daddy. Don't worry, I'll be back. Please. Want to help the Galactic Attack? Here's the thing about tofu tuna. It tastes like tofu that's been stored in dirty socks. Tommy : You ever wonder what real tuna tasted like? Nate : Every time I eat sock tuna. Why I'm eating genetically engineered tofu instead of... What the hell? Nate : Naomi? Terra : I think you're looking for me. That ain't half bad. 25 years old. It's a gift from the president. Let me ask you something, General. How is it you make a virus like that and not an antidote? We didn't have the luxury of time. And I didn't know that Molly was... You care for her quite a bit, don't you? I hate playing catch-up. Aliens. Intelligent life-forms from another galaxy. I've seen some things since this started I never thought I'd see. Seems to me, it's not about what you see. It's what you do about what you see. Oh, well, this the, uh, moral high ground you're about to take again? Terrorists aren't born, they are made. They're made by dropping bioweapons when you say you have a peace treaty. Or by wiping out a platoon of your people because you may or may not have a shot at a single high-value target. Oh, so now we're talking Second Kuwait, not about hybrids. I lost a lot of men. And walked away from the fight. It didn't seem like my fight anymore. Something you learn when you're the one giving the orders: sometimes there are no good decisions. It's just a lesser of two evils. And from my seat, that's the best that you can do. Evil is still evil, General. Even when it's lesser. She thinks I killed her husband. Molly does. So do I. He was my friend. Your friend that just happened to have an accident... while you were stealing his program out from underneath him. Seems awfully coincidental, don't you think? Yeah. And I don't believe in coincidences. But you do believe he was murdered. Yes, I do. Man : She can't you hurt in there. It's a Faraday cage. Faraday cages. The copper in the walls and the ceilings block radio transmission frequencies. It also blocks hybrids from emitting electro-magnetic impulses. Yeah. So don't worry. We're not worried. [Chuckles] I want to go in first. Just for a second, okay? You will be all right? Okay. 
 
 [Beep, door hissing open] [Monitor beeping rhythmically] [Door hissing, latch clicks] Molly, I don't know if you can hear me. But I brought Ethan here. I just wanted to talk to you first. A couple things. Things I want to say. Things I want you to understand. They were gonna shut Ethan down permanently. So I took him to save him. [Crying]: And the reprogramming... He was just hurting so bad. I was so wrong. I was so foolish. But John loved you, Molly. He loved you to the very end. I swear. The night he died, he was so angry. And he said I was being naive. Molly, I... I think I may have somehow... gotten him killed. He was right about the Humanichs. He said I was making a deal with the devil. I've made so many wrong choices, Molly. But I promise you... I won't ever do that again. Girl : Where's my daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Where's my daddy? Don't worry about it. I'm sure he's around here somewhere. Hey! Wait, come back! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! [Moaning] Daddy? Daddy! Honey... I remember now. You brought me here... so you could have your tryst with Mrs. Caber. Baby girl... [Crying]: How could you? Wait! We do it and we do it now. Wait. What are you saying, Julie? I'm saying I don't care what happens, I'm not making the wrong decision again. Shut the program down, Charlie. You realize we could go to jail for this. Yeah, I do. Okay, just so we're on the same page. I need the security doors opened. Of course, General Shepherd. Happy to help. Terra. It worked. They thought I was dead. We tried it Ahdu's way. And now we do it mine. [Gun cocks] [Gunshot] All right, here's... here's what I know. John went to Humanichs, he got in a fight with Julie. Leaves, she makes a call to some encrypted number. And-and an hour later, John was dead. No, Julie Gelineau is not a killer. Yeah, but whoever she called... Yeah, Anna, my colleague. She doesn't have the authority. No, whoever made that call came from above. But every time I sniff around, the trail goes cold. Maybe you're not inhaling deep enough, General. Don't you think that I want to know the truth? [Laughs softly] You know what? Maybe it's this... presidential scotch kicking in, but I actually believe you. Sometimes decisions are made that leave no fingerprints. And there are people above me, nameless people who always get what they want. No matter the cost. That's right. Did John have any enemies outside the GSC? What? I don't know, man. I'm just thinking out loud. Yeah, one. Who? Nicholas Calderon, but that was a long time ago. Richter : Stop that image. Pause image. Go-go-go back. Rewind. Stop. You've got hybrids. And not the warm, fuzzy kind. Security. We have a breach. [Alarm buzzing] Charlie : Damn, another shut down failure. Cancel the install. I mean, the limiters won't reload. How is that possible? Evolution. They've changed. Their-their decision trees have grown new branches. What I'm saying is do not take them off standby mode. And what we're gonna need to do is begin a physical disassembly. For real? Yes, Carol, for very real. Arms in one box, heads in another? If we have to. And come on, guys, we need to do this right now, before they learn how to turn themselves back on. Alert voice : Attention. This is a call for the immediate deployment of the Humanichs force to the GSC. Repeat. This is a call for the immediate deployment of the Humanichs force to the GSC. [Carnival music playing] ♪ ♪ [Child giggling] [Film projector clicking] JOHN: Molly, it's been over... Molly : Weird how? Ethan : To be back in my body again, but bigger. John : It was a mistake. Ethan : It was like I was a bird... Molly : A mistake? This, what you've been doing... I'm an astronaut! It's my job! [Overlapping voices] John : Yes, I-I did. I lied. Turns out you... [Quinn clears his throat] Oh, there you are, baby girl. You know, sometimes... we see things and we misunderstand. Yeah. And you tried to convince me that I didn't see anything. You said I could get cotton candy. I'm sorry. Sorry about what? Because you got caught? You lied to me, Daddy. You brought me to this carnival so you could see your mistress. And you used your nine-year-old little daughter! It's not like that. It's-it's complicated. You were screwing the neighbor. What's so complicated about that? Then you should have said something. Not screwed your lab assistant in our house! [Cell phone ringing] Go ahead. Answer it. You answer it... and they tell you about the crash. And they tell you that Mommy's dead. [Phone continues ringing] Her car ran off the road and hit a tree. All while you were back there with Mrs. Caber behind the ride. So go ahead, answer it. Answer it, you b*st*rd. [Phone continues ringing] [Maniacal laughter] I can't find my mom. I'm lost! Me, too. I'm lost, too. Maybe we can help each other. There's your mom, right there. No, she's not my mom. I want my real mom. Kid's lost, huh? He's looking for his m... Miss? Hey. You all right? No. Ethan : Mom, it's me. I have to go. Ethan : Mom? Please don't go. I have to go. Mom, I'm here. I think my... My special day is over. Ethan : I know who I am. I know who you are. Mom, it's me, Ethan. I'm here. Please don't go. [Alarm sounds] [Line ringing] Julie : This is Julie, leave a message at the beep. [Beeps] [Computer chirps] Electronic voice : Incoming call. Incoming call. Incoming call. This is Tobias Shepherd. Uh, hello, sir. This is a code red. We have hybrids here in the GSC. We've had casualties already. Their intent is clear. If you don't deploy the Humanichs now, I have to assume that the casualty rate here will be 100%. But Julie and Ethan are there. Along with about 700 others. All counting on you. Take them off standby. And God help us. ♪ ♪ [Maniacal laughter] [Child shouts in distance]: Mommy? [Maniacal laughter] ♪ ♪ [Maniacal laughter] [Carnival music plays] [Monitor beeping rhythmically] [Molly groans] What's wrong with her? Electronic voice : Medical alert. Code blue. [Gasping] Life functions critical. We're under attack. I need to take you to a secure bunker. This woman needs a doctor now! That's impossible, we're in lockdown. Mom! Somebody do something! Medical alert. Code blue. [Gasping] Life functions critical. ♪ ♪ You don't have to take that ride right now, baby girl. I made up my mind. What are you doing? She's trying to decide whether she's gonna take that ride. Why? Uh, she's given up on us. Richter : Ah, the easy way out. Quinn : Mm, looks like it. Eh, why bother? So you both are a part of me, projections of my thoughts and feelings, right? So why don't you tell me why I shouldn't get on this ride? Quinn : Hey, hey, you're right, baby girl. People are hopeless. They make mistakes that they don't learn from, and even when we try to help them, they screw up again. This is your idea of helping? Quinn : Molly, y-you can give up. And you have every right to do so. But here's the thing about this world. Now, you may decide that, uh, things will never change, and there's nothing you can do about it, and you still try your best anyway, huh? That's what keeps us from going under. It's the struggle. Mistakes are what makes us human. All of us. But forgiveness, that gives us humanity. It's time, baby girl. It's time to forgive me, forgive John and forgive yourself. I should have been a better wife and mother. Eh, you and everybody else on the planet. John cheated on me, Daddy. I couldn't forgive him. Just like I couldn't forgive you. Loving doesn't come easy to me. Can't you see, Daddy? I've been running from you and Mrs. Caber... my whole life. Room for one more. Wait, baby, come on, you can't change the past, but you can change the future. You are the future. With you, the human race evolves. Without you... Carny : Time's running out here, doll. Ethan : Mom, Mom. Don't go. Ethan? Okay, wait. I want to go back... I want to go back! Let me go back! I want to go... It's too late, lady. You've made your choice. [Alarm sounding] Ethan : Mom, wake up. Please wake up. [Alarm sounding] [Monitor flatlines] She's gone, honey. No. No! We have to go now. No, I won't. Let's go. Let's go. Now! [Monitor flatlines] [Door hissing closed, latch clicks] [Alarm sounds] There's poetry to it, isn't there? They make a virus to destroy us, we release viruses to destroy them. Hey, we're counting on you. Electronic voice : System overload. [Monitor continues flatlining]
