 What's your recommendation? 
 Taalr : Release the virus... 
 in conjunction with the deployment of the Humanich army. 
 Run! 
 JD : You exposed Molly to the virus. 
 I'm dying. 
 Did John have any enemies? 
 Yeah, one. 
 Molly, I have to tell you something. 
 I'm going to Calder... 
 Nicholas Calderon. 
 Lucy is the problem. 
 Julie : She attacked me. 
 We got to shut them down. Come on, guys, right now. 
 Before they learn how to turn themselves back on. 
 I need the security doors opened. 
 Of course. 
 Shepherd : We have hybrids in the GSC. 
 If you don't deploy the Humanichs now, the casualty rate here will be 100%. 
 Take them off standby. 
 We're counting on you. 
 Female electronic voice : Medical alert. Code blue. 
 This woman needs a doctor now! 
 That's impossible, we're in lockdown. 
 JD : What are you doing? 
 I made up my mind. 
 [Flatline tone] 
 [Music box playing] 
 [Distorted sound of child's laughter] 
 [Overlapping, distorted voices] 
 Who's there? 
 Child [distorted] : Mommy! 
 What did you do to me? 
 [Flatline tone] 
 [Gasping] 
 Man over P.A. : Building security has been breached. 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 Please evacuate immediately. 
 Female voice : This is a temporary measure, employed for your safety. 
 Do not panic. 
 No, no, no! 
 Override. Shepherd. 4930. 
 Female voice : I'm sorry, General Shepherd. 
 Your override has been denied by the system. 
 P.a. : Please evacuate immediately. 
 We shouldn't have left her. 
 She's gone, honey, there's nothing more we can do. 
 Male voice : This is a level-one lockdown. 
 Hey, kid! 
 Ethan! Ethan! 
 I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't go back in there. 
 Get off me! Ethan! 
 Give me your tie. 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 Female voice : Fire detected. 
 Please evacuate immediately. 
 Male voice : Level-one lockdown. Please... 
 There's been a breach of the virus containment unit. 
 Hybrids have infiltrated. 
 How many? 
 Varying reports. We've released Humanichs into the building. 
 They have orders: shoot to kill. 
 Molly. 
 If she's still alive. 
 Dead or alive, I'm not leaving her here. 
 Take the stairwell to level two. It's already been swept. Go. 
 Come on, let's get out of here! 
 [Gasping, coughing] 
 [Crackling] 
 Julie : Ethan! 
 Ethan! 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 Lucy? 
 How is that possible? 
 [Elevator bell chimes] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 [Crackling] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Muffled]: Help me! 
 [Alarm blaring] 
 Let me out! 
 Mom! You're alive! 
 Ethan! Let me out! 
 Open the door! 
 Female voice : Password error. 
 Password error. Password error. 
 Lockout overridden. 
 I knew you'd come back. 
 Come back from where? 
 You died. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Molly? 
 I thought we'd lost you. 
 Guess I'm not that easy to lose. 
 We got to get out of here. 
 Right now. 
 Terra's here. 
 Well, Ares is, too. He's gonna blow the place up. 
 I got to find her. 
 Whatever we do, we do it now. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on. 
 [Alarm continuing] 
 Molly? 
 I thought you were... 
 Guess I wasn't finished here. 
 What's happening? 
 Hybrids in the virus containment. There's a hostage situation. 
 You know how many? 
 Not sure. 
 The security feed is out. 
 Humanichs have been instructed to shoot hybrids on sight. 
 Computer voice : Plasma mine armed. 
 Plasma mine armed. 
 Nate : Molly. Molly! We gotta get out of here. Molly. Hey. I'm going in. No. Molly... It's Terra. Stay here and watch for Humanichs. Please. Terra! Open the door. I need to talk to you. Please! [Door lock blipping] Hello, Molly. Hi, Terra. Toby. Molly. I have always loved you. You know that. [Elevator bell chimes] Female voice : Tier level four, access is suspended. Sorry, no access to the virus containment without General Shepherd's express authorization. If you don't release the elevators, I'll have to use force. Humanichs are forbidden from harming humans. It's a violation of basic robot protocol. [Crack] I'm not a robot. They said you were dead. I came back, just like you. We're survivors. Not for long. Okay, you push that button... you start a war. One we will not win. There's more of us than you think. Not enough. Then our names will ring in the ears of every human and hybrid for eternity. That's not you, Terra. You've been with Ares. He's not weak like Ahdu was. Well, he left you here to die. Now, I held you in my arms not that long ago. Don't you remember? I remember. Yeah. Molly : Our people... didn't come clear around the universe so you could die. We came to live. You're not one of us. Yes... I am. I shed the last of my old life today. Woke with clear eyes... and an understanding of what can be. We... can build the future together. Even if I believed you... [Sniffles] it's too late. The others are gone. [Sniffles] There's no way I'm getting out of here alive. But what if you could, Terra? [Alarm blaring] Come on... Murderer. That's what you are. Why should I listen to anything you have to say? He's a killer. He wants us all dead. That's not true. I can see what's in your head... your heart. Then you can see that I don't want to hurt you. 'Cause you're too young to die. And I can get you out of here. Safely. Yeah. Please... [Whirrs, powering down] We got to go. Humanichs are on the way. Shepherd : Evacuation tunnels down the hall. Look for a panel by the heating vent. Take this phone, only I can call it, and I will. Okay, come on. Let's go! JD... Hey! I need your handcuffs. [Ethan panting] Ethan... What's wrong? Are you okay? Something's happening. Wait, he's one of them. A Humanich. Molly : All Humanichs aren't killers. The same goes for hybrids. And humans, for that matter. I won't hurt you. I promise. Guys, we gotta move. Let's go. [Lock beeping] How many were there, General? Just one, a suicide bomber who lost her nerve. Headed toward the south wing. Wait... Check the evac tunnels. Hey, I said the south wing. I have other orders. From who? A higher authority. And who's that, exactly? [Explosion thunders] [Power whirrs, equipment clicks] Are you sure we're safe here? My buddy Ray's got this place cloaked in ferrofluids, so from above it just looks like a black hole. What about food? Enough food here to get us through the winter. What's that? That thing? It's a little TV. Thing's so old that it won't even leave an electronic footprint. Newswoman : We're getting preliminary reports of a bomb blast that ripped through the GSC Intelligence Wing. The blast is linked to a teenage terrorist who is reportedly connected to former astronaut Dr. Molly Woods and former Patrol Special Officer JD Richter. This is a terrorist group with mysterious intentions. Who are these people, and what do they want? [Static buzzes, crackles] We didn't do it. J.d. : You know what I think? I think Uncle Ares left us a little parting gift. Molly : Mm-mm. She's telling the truth. Somebody's setting us up. So what, Shepherd just revoked our hall pass? No. He wouldn't do that. JD : No, of course not. It must be Colonel Mustard in the library with the freakin' candlestick. Where are you going? He thinks we did it, and so will the rest of the world. Okay, look, you can't go out there. It's dangerous. I'm gonna figure this whole thing out. Okay? I promise. Man : Initial reports, five dead so far. But the rescue crews are still digging. The intelligence floor was wiped out, sir. Do you have names of the deceased? These four died in the blast, and this one due to bodily injury. Bodily injury? Preliminary reports say "broken neck." I'm glad to see you're all right, Tobias. Nate Malone, he was on the virus team. He was a good man. They all were. The hybrids escaped through the evac tunnels. Only a handful of people with top security clearance know they exist. Those tunnels have been there for over 50 years, you know. They could have found them any number of ways. And Molly Woods? What do we know? Well, the Faraday Wing was destroyed, but we think she flatlined before the blast. Find her body. I want proof of her death. Of course. And, Toby... I want the name of every employee with security clearance who knew about those tunnels. We may have a mole. Fiona : Casualties are never easy to explain to a mother or spouse, or a commander in chief. This one gives me pause. [Sighs]: Very well. He attempted to keep us from the virus containment. He was protecting somebody. Who? I don't know. There were hybrids in the building with bombs. Lives hung in the balance. I had to take swift action. And so... I killed him. Regrettable... but necessary. I thought so. Madam Secretary, we've identified the bodies. All those missing have been accounted for, except for Molly Woods. Dispatch a Humanichs team. Find Molly Woods and bring her in. Dead or alive? Either. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, but he's not seeing... It's all right. I lost Ethan. I know there were casualties... Well... he wasn't among them. [Relieved sigh] I had a local GPS on him and it cut out. If Lucy finds him, she'll hurt him. Why would she want to hurt Ethan? Sir... Lucy attacked me. A Humanich attacked a human? Yes! Ethan pulled her circuits out to save my life. We decommissioned her. We put her in a box. Someone overrode us and put her back into operation. "A higher authority." What? Why haven't you gone to Anna with this? The night John Woods died, I went to Anna and... I told her that he was thinking about shutting us down. Anna : Hello? It's Julie. I think I may have just really screwed up. Start from the beginning. I'll take care of it. Half an hour later, he was dead. Anna's the only one who could have put Lucy back into operation. I mean, who else could it be? I'll investigate this quietly, but in the meantime, it has to stay between us. I'll look for Ethan, make sure he's safe. Shepherd : Computer access. Show me the latest file on Nicholas Calderon. [Sighs] 
 
 Did I fall asleep? You did. You needed it. Molly, we need to talk about what I saw in that room. Your... your skin, I don't know, it was like... It was like you had molted or something. I know. I'm changing. I've been given a second chance at life. I'm stronger. I'm more alive. And I saw things. What kind of things did you see? What did you do to me? [Phone buzzes, chimes] It's Shepherd. He wants to meet. Screw Shepherd. You can't leave here. Your face is everywhere. We finally have an ally in this fight. Now that's progress. Can't you see that? Listen to me. All right? I know a guy. He runs a vanishing service. He's like an international coyote. He can make us disappear. Disappear? To where? I don't care. Throw a dart at a map. Somewhere safe. There is no "safe"... until I see us through this. There is no "I" here, Molly. We are in this together. [Sighs softly] [Whispers]: I know. Right. You're not the only one that's been given a second chance. Look, I... I don't believe in that "destiny" crap, I-I just don't. But when I add up all the things that had to happen to bring us together... [Sighs] that's all the proof I need to know that the universe... has a couple miracles up its sleeve. Even for us. Well, the only way out... is to finish what we started. I got something for you. [Sighs]: You're gonna need this. You're gonna wear it like a hood. It's got a reflective coating. It'll block facial recognition from any kind of security cams. But it's not gonna do anything if a Humanich spots you. This will. No. I... Molly... No. Take it. I'm not gonna lose you again. [Sighs] Okay. ♪ ♪ I will see you soon. ♪ ♪ [Door opens and closes] [Alarm blips, lock clicks open] Hello, Julie. I need to find Molly Woods. She died. You're lying. No, I saw her die in the Faraday Wing at the GSC. There are cameras everywhere, you know. You shouldn't have tried to kill me. You were malfunctioning. I shut you down. How... How... could I be rebuilt and rebooted? Is that what you want to know? That's classified. If I find out you lied, I'm going to be very angry. Say hello to Ethan. Terra didn't set off that bomb, Toby. You have to believe me. I know. A Humanich killed Nate Malone today. No. That's not possible. The rules and protocols for the A.I. programming don't allow that. The rules are being rewritten. By who? Nicholas Calderon. Now, what do you know about him? All I know is that he and John created the Humanich prototype together. They had a huge falling-out, and then... His work took a turn for the dramatic. Blew up a defense building in Wichita a few years back, swore he was just getting warmed up. Cal-der... Cal-der. Right before John died, he left me a message. I thought he was going to "call" somebody, but he was going to Calderon. Maybe John stumbled upon his plan to hijack the Humanichs program. So you think he killed him? Yeah. And he has a greater scheme: total subversion of the Constitution, a complete coup, without any fingerprints. To what end? To stoke up enough fear about the hybrid threat, and we'll create more and more Humanichs to protect us. So the Humanichs are now answering to Calderon? Yeah. But how could he know about the hybrids? [Laughs softly] He has an old friend right down the hall from me, a perfect ally. Taylor. Who? A threat assessment computer that he and John created for us, way back. Calderon knows Taylor like the back of his hand. We've had geniuses put in firewall after firewall, but he could just blow right through that. So everything Taylor knows is now in the hands of a madman? Yeah. Now I am gonna find Calderon and I am gonna take him down. But in the meantime, you, Terra, JD and Ethan, you need to disappear. No more killing on my watch. You are a good man, Toby. Now... Now, listen, keep the phone. I'll call. Mr. Richter? Mr. Richter? I can't sleep. I tried powering down, but I can't for some reason. [Sighs]: Yeah. Powering down. I get that. All right, well... what do you do... when you can't power down? Play a game. What kind of game? Spherical chess. [Sighs]: Spherical chess. You lost me at "chess." Are you up for learning something new? Always. Yeah? I have an idea. I raise you five chips. Five chips, huh? You trying to clean me out? All right. I call. Show 'em. Full house, jacks over twos. Texas hold 'em's really fun. I'm surprised you stayed in with three twos. Yep, I'm surprised, too. Playing poker with a computer... I should have my head examined. So, what are your intentions? Intentions? With my mom. Okay. My intentions are to keep her, you, and your friend Terra there safe. How does that sound? Sounds... good. [Slightly distorted]: G-G-G-Good. You okay, kid? I'm not feeling very well. Like what, like a stomachache? Excuse me. I think I need to run... [Slowing]: a diagnostic. Ethan? Ethan! [Knocking on door] Something's wrong with Ethan. Oh, my God. Ethan... He was running some sort of diagnostic... Nobody left me a robot handbook. Ethan! Mom? I'm... overloaded. What's happening? [Electronic whirr, blipping] He's burning up. He's running at 200% capacity. Okay... I'm gonna have to protect your neural net from overloading, so I'm gonna have to do a hard shutdown, okay? You ready? [Whirrs, powering down] If we don't get him help right away, he could have permanent damage. Terra, JD and I are gonna have to take Ethan somewhere. I need you to stay here. Do not open the door. Do not make a peep. We're gonna be back in a few hours. Can you do that? Will he be okay? Yes. We're all gonna be okay. We're gonna leave here first thing in the morning. Lock the door behind us. Have you located Molly Woods? Not yet. But there's something I'd like you to see. Lucy : The hybrids knocked out most of our security cameras, but the Virus Containment cam runs off auxiliary power. We found this reflection. Lucy : Enhance 266 to 145. Stop. Move in. Stop. Track 77 right. Stop. Enhance 34 to 44. Again. [Fiona sighs]: Ah... We have a traitor in our midst, Madam Secretary. Verdisign : Julie, you have a visitor. [Knocking on door] Molly? Sorry we didn't call. We couldn't risk it. We need your help. Julie : You did the right thing in shutting him down. His processors are not responding. Like they're off on another task or something. D-Do you think he's damaged? No. It'll take me some time to restore his backup. We'll know more then. [Computer beeping] Go make yourself a drink. Don't worry, I got this. [Softly]: Okay. [Whirring] Taalr : Tobias Shepherd, identification confirmed. Taylor, what is the current status of Nicholas Calderon? Nicholas Calderon has been a fugitive for the past seven years. Despite all our efforts his whereabouts are unknown. He designed you along with John Woods. They made the first iteration of me. The breadth of my capabilities has been improved upon a billionfold since then. When was the last time Calderon accessed you, Taylor? Taylor! I'm not at liberty to say... in light of your recent status. Shepherd : Wh-What? Your clearance has been revoked. [Alarm blaring] My clearance? Due to the charges brought against you. [Alarm continues] [Elevator bell chimes] Get him! Shepherd : Get off me! Toby, you're under arrest. Shepherd : On what charge? Aiding and adhering to a known enemy. Treason. So, Shepherd says that Nicholas Calderon hijacked Humanichs... and killed John. Yeah. And Toby's gonna find him. He's gonna shutter the whole Humanichs project, and there's gonna be no more hybrid kill squads. I wouldn't count on that, Molly. Okay. Well, at any rate... he told us we need to lay low, get out of sight. So those "vanishers"... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those papers are ready and waiting for us whenever we need them. [Sighs]: Good. Molly, you said that... you saw some things when you... when you died. What did you see? I went to a place that I used to love... and I remembered some things that I tried to forget. But you remember them now. Yeah. And I... I came to a place of forgiveness. Molly, you're not telling me something. What is it? What... What did you see? Molly... what did you do to me? Hey. Molly. Talk to me. I saw you... and you were dying. And I think I killed you. All right, just so you know... you're definitely not the first woman to have that particular dream. No, no, no. That's all it is, Molly, all right? That's... It was a dream. But what if it's not? Julie : Molly? Molly : What's happening? Julie : I-I don't know. Mom. Ethan. Are you okay? I have a message. From who? Dad. Where is Molly Woods? Shepherd : She's not your problem. Fiona : Illuminate me. Get rid of the guards. Out. [Door hissing open] Hybrids didn't blow up the Intelligence wing. I suppose it was ghosts. Yeah. Something like that. Nicholas Calderon. [Chuckles] Calderon is the fever dream of every law enforcement agency in this country. Santa Claus would be easier to find. Lucy was decommissioned by Julie Gelineau. Did you recommission her? Because I didn't. The Humanichs have been taken over by Calderon. He's giving them direct commands. He's inside their head. And who's in yours? What? When Shayna Velez resigned, she sent me a note warning me of your obsession with Molly Woods. [Groans] She said your judgment had been compromised. I should have taken it more seriously. We've all been compromised. We've been playing Calderon's game. He's pulling the strings. Fiona... We're on the wrong side in this war. He ginned up the hybrid threat... to launch a worldwide Humanichs revolution. Can't you see? Peace with the hybrids is the only way. There's no virus that can kill them all. And those that remain will procreate, and the madness will just start all over again. Pretty soon, we'll have a police state run by Humanichs, controlled by Nicholas Calderon. You need a good lawyer, Toby. And a better psychiatrist. As the nation mourns the victims of the GSC bombing, anti-terrorist units have been deployed in a worldwide search for the bombers. In a statement from the White House, officials said, quote: [Knocking on door] "We will hunt down these cowards at all costs. Justice will be swift and severe." Hello, little dove. It's time to come home. Shepherd : Edward? Yes, sir. Is this your third tour with me now? Fourth. You ever know me to violate the code of honor? No sir. Then would you do me the favor... of letting me walk these halls one last time with dignity? Sir... Come on, I'm asking. Soldier to soldier. And what kind of soldier would I be if I did that? Well, not my kind. Let's go. John's voice : Molly? This is John. If you're listening to this, it means I'm dead. I built this message into Ethan in the event of a worst-case scenario. That scenario has happened. A Humanich has killed a human being and breached the primary protocol. This is a harbinger of, uh... greater crimes to come. There's only one thing that can stop them. The person who has been entrusted with guarding this is Nicholas Calderon. He's your only hope. [Ethan collapses onto bed] Which is it? Is Calderon the savior or the devil? Maybe he's both. ♪ ♪ [Engines whirring, whooshing] Ligar para Molly Woods. [Phone rings, blips] Toby? Toby... [Distorted]: Molly... [Explosion thunders over phone] Toby!
