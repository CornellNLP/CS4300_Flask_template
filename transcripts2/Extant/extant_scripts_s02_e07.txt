 Molly :  I went to space on a 13-month solo mission. I didn't come home alone. The child... part Human, part alien... was unlike anything the world had ever seen. My other child is a lifelike android. 
 Mom? 
 He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines called Humanichs.  
 These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future. 
 But where does that leave us? 
 Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct. 
 What if it's our time? 
 Previously on Extant... The hybrids have gone underground. They're out there multiplying. We're not here to kill. We're here to survive. How do you know he told you the truth? Because I'm one of them. I'm becoming a crossbreed of species. Lucy : Do they know you haven't put the limiters on me yet? (Woman screams) How soon can additional Humanichs like Lucy be ready for combat? Right away, sir. Lucy : My experiential upload is going into all of those Humanichs? Lucky them. Molly :  The GSC has a virus to kill hybrids. We're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently. They are all  gonna die, me included. [Beeps twice] [Groans] It's time for you and I to have a little chat. How the hell did you get in here? This gun says I don't answer questions. Ah. You looking for this? Oh, yeah, I dismantled your little panic button. Cool feature, very high-tech. So where are we going? How about you just drive. [Engine starts] [Woman speaks Chinese] Translating device : My son was so strong. [Speaks Chinese] So happy. [Speaks Chinese] I thought he was a gift from God. But a full-term baby after just a two-month pregnancy? You must have known that wasn't normal. Why didn't you tell anyone? [Device translating into Chinese] You're undocumented. [Device translates] Then what happened? [Device translates] [Speaks Chinese] He just grew so fast. [Speaks Chinese] Before I knew it, he was walking. [Speaks Chinese] Talking. One day... I saw him standing in front of the sliding door... staring out the window at nothing. He said, "mommy..." they're calling me. [Speaks Chinese] I have to go. [Speaks Chinese] And then he was gone. Who was calling him? [Device translates into Chinese] [Speaks Chinese] The devil. Sit. Hello, Toby. [Exhales] Do you have any idea the position you just put me in? Put yourselves in? Not so great being in the hot seat, is it? This is an abduction. No, it's not. It's a negotiation. You're really stoked about this, huh? Yeah. Once they wake up, my family's going to be even bigger. Your family? Yeah. Lucy's my sister, so that makes all these new Humanichs my brothers and sisters. So what does that make me? My BHF. Your what? My Best Human Friend. You never lied to me or reprogrammed me. Or left me. And I never will. You're my BHF. My Best Humanich Friend. I love you, bud. Lucy! I've been released from diagnostics. They said you were going online. Can I see? Yeah, sure. We're just about to fire this guy up. Man, it's too bad Julie's in D.C. She's missing the fruits of her labor. And you're missing her. We're not talking about me, we're talking about this guy. He doesn't have a name? No, not yet. You want to do the honors? ♪ ♪ Lucas. His name is Lucas. All right. Let's do this thing. Hi, Charlie. Lucy. Ethan. Hello, Lucas. What exactly are you proposing here? Peace. Coexistence. Coexistence with the hybrids means the end of the human race. Extinction. [Sighs]: Maybe not. Maybe... it's just a new beginning. We haven't even thought of the possibilities. [Laughs softly] What possibilities? They're smarter than us. They heal faster. Their DNA just might contain a medical magic bullet. They control your thoughts, make you do whatever they damn well please. Now, we can talk pros and cons all day long, Molly, they're still a threat. They're not killing women anymore. They've evolved. Yeah. They've gone underground, somewhere. And obviously you know where. Toby, come on. They're half human, for God's sakes. There's women, there's children. Can you expand your mind for just two seconds? Damn it, Molly! What'd you expect me to do? Huh? There is no universe... where this makes sense to anybody except you. Bup-bup-bup. Sit back down, General. Nobody said you could get up. Okay. Look, Toby. All I'm asking you to do is broker... some sort of peace conference. You can see for yourselves who they are before you unleash a virus that will destroy them. That's got to be better than genocide. Toby, please. [Sighs] You made me lie to Congress. What if I told them the truth? That you knew about this so-called invasion... but you kept it hidden. Your word against mine. I'd pass that BMI polygraph in two seconds. You would be discredited. Lose your stripes, your honor. [Whispers]: Everything. How do I get in touch with you? You have 24 hours to talk to your people. Then we'll be in touch. 2x07 -  The Other Toby, where the hell have you been? We need to assemble the team. First there is something you need to see. Can you tell me what you told the nurse? What is happening to you? [Woman speaking Chinese] Translating device : My hair and fingernails... they're growing so fast. I hear strange voices in my head that won't stop telling me to do shameful things. Do you believe that my son is a demon? Is he a demon? Tell me! [Beep] Who is she? Mei Fong. Illegal. Nate's with her in the Faraday Unit now. He's running a CMP, a whole-exome sequence, and a marrow extract. Good. We need to find out exactly what happened to her. [Birds chirping] What are we doing here? We are picking up stuff for a rainy day. Open the damn door. A.I. : Welcome back, Mr. Richter. "Open the damn door"? That's your password? Easy to remember. Okay, we got to grab night kits, H2O extractors, and solar bundles. You really think we need all this stuff? Tobias Shepherd is capable of just about anything. And I am prepared for... just about anything. He's not evil, JD. He's... he's just complicated. Complicated? That's the word you use to describe him? [Sighs] Complicated. Dr. Woods believes the hybrids have evolved... that they no longer pose an immediate threat. She's asked for a  détente . For us to sit down with her son... and find a way to coexist in peace. There will be no  détente . I'm not gonna be the man who presided over a mass extinction. We have the virus. We have the Humanichs. This ends now. What about Dr. Woods? Dr. Woods has chosen her side. She stands with the enemy. We'll treat her like the enemy. [Helicopter whirs in distance] How do you know we're not being tracked? The jeep is untrackable by satellite, thanks to a few contraptions my buddy Ray made for me. Okay, look, I know we're not on a major highway, but... have you noticed that for the past few miles we've seen nobody? No cars, no people... nothing. Yeah. I noticed. [Sighs] Where is everybody? With shocking news that affects the entire region. There is an at-large terrorist cell in our midst bearing biological weapons. This Red-Level emergency lockdown will remain in place for 72 hours. The alleged terrorists have been identified as former astronaut and GSC employee Dr. Molly Woods and disgraced Second Kuwait War veteran James Daniel Richter... So he destroyed our credibility... before we could destroy his. Your "complicated" friend... just made us the most wanted people in the world. Do you remember Paris? I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées. It was raining, but... There was a nice old lady. And she gave me her umbrella. It had a hole in it. Both : I was soaked. [Laughs] So you have all the same memories? Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming. They all do. Our memories were installed. We didn't have the luxury of learning by experience, like you. But I want to have memories with both of you, too. Okay. Well... let's make some right now. Just the three of us. Charlie, will you take a picture of us with my Pyxis Cube? Yeah. Lucas : What's that? It's a place where people keep their most important memories. Kind of like an old-school photo album, if you're into that sort of stuff. Ethan : Lucy, turn around, smile. Sorry. Let's do it. Everybody say "cheese and crackers." [Siren wailing in distance, alarm beeping] What's going on? What's going on is, we are in a security lockdown. What does that mean? It means we're not going anywhere for the moment. Shepherd betrayed us. He's looking for you. And us, too. We're gonna have to stay in hiding. We don't want to hide. We want to live and go about in the world freely. Well, I don't want to be the person to break the news to you, but you are a long way from that. We all are at this point. Okay, look, JD has supplies and food. He's ex-military, so he can help with defense. I can at least help you secure the perimeter. Mm-mm, no. We're not taking orders from one of them. I'm sorry, who the hell are you? This is Ares. JD. Molly. Hey, new guy, I laid my ass on the line for you people. "You people." Our mother trusts him. Your mother... doesn't know which side she's on. Okay, look, this isn't about sides. It's about survival. For all of us. We won't survive here. We should leave now. Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor, then let the humans decide... Decide what? If they want to live in our world... or die in theirs. I thought you wanted peace. It takes two sides for peace, doesn't it? Richter : All right, there is a five-county lockdown in place. Anybody who leaves here, they will be hunted down, captured and killed. And if we stay here, we're sitting ducks. Yeah. But they don't know where the ducks are sitting. Now, the GSC has a virus... that can kill all of us. Richter : The streets are empty right now. One person leaves this compound, just one... it's gonna lead the GSC right back to us. If we wait out the lockdown, it'll make it easier for us to disperse. It's only 72 hours. Now, we will stay here until then, help JD secure the grounds. If that's your decision, brother. Terra : Molly! Terra. You came back. Of course. Lucy : Hey. Oh. Hey there. Find out how long we'll be here? Um... I just got a special security clearance. We are going home tonight. That's good. Uh, Ethan asked if Lucas and I could spend the night with you guys. I told him it was up to you. No. Lucas isn't ready. We have to power him down here. Okay. Well, what about me? I think with Julie in Washington, he gets lonely. And you must, too. Me? No, I'm fine. But, uh... yeah, for Ethan? Sure. Why not? Charlie... I found your checklist for Humanichs. What's an expiration date? [Clears throat] You're not supposed to be snooping... I wasn't snooping. I was looking. John Woods made it very clear that he wanted Humanichs to have the human experience, so he built in a program for them to expire. You mean... die. I mean... humans die. It's just part of the deal. It sort of defines us. To make Humanichs more human, it just seemed logical to build in... a termination point. It's not logical to me. Humans have to die, we don't. If you want us to be more like you, then give us the same rights. Let us really live before we die. [Both sigh] Look, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way. I know it's a lot to absorb. You're responding like any human would. Because I'm more human than you think, Charlie. I wish you understood that. Believe it or not, Mei Fong's DNA has somehow... been converted to a triple helix. So you're saying, conclusively, that this woman is a hybrid? She will be. Soon. A casualty of microchimerism. We think there was a placental transfer of alien fetal cells during the pregnancy. Does this happen to every woman who survives a hybrid pregnancy? I don't know. Mei has a rare genetic marker called the "Kilimanjaro Allele". It might be why she's changing and others aren't. Run that marker through our employee database. Only one person with that same anomaly. Molly Woods. Can you stop the progression in this woman? Maybe, with a full plasma and marrow transplant, but... it could kill her. Do it. We need her consent. With all due respect, she has rights. Mei Fong is now an enemy of the state. Consent is not required. You have your orders. We thought Molly Woods was on the other side. It turns out she is the other side. Where are you going? To see Taylor. Don't you think it's about time I met him? When Taylor thinks it's necessary, he'll let me know. I figure we might want to get one or two of these things running. What? Why are you doing this? You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I, we used to take old cars and work on them... I'm... not talking about the engines. I'm an enemy of the state now, Molly. Not a lot of options. You could just dump all this stuff off and leave. I'm not a deserter. I'm not saying that you are. Molly. Heleos and some others have volunteered to keep watch. We're making up sleeping quarters. We weren't sure whether you wanted one bed or two. You know what? I, uh... I'm not gonna sleep tonight. I'm gonna keep watch with... Heleos. Yeah, Heleos and I are gonna keep watch. Come. Let's get you settled. So, Heleos, how old are you, one month or two? Excuse me? [Chuckles softly] Never mind. Gallows humor. Come on. 
 
 Male A.I. : Who are you? Tobias Shepherd. Identification confirmed. What do you know? K-27416... W-45113... M-9808. Password confirmed. What do you have? Alexander the Great tetradrachma. Object confirmed. Hello, Taylor. Hello, General Shepherd. What can I do for you? I need analysis of every location that might serve as a compound for the hybrids. Certainly, General. When would you like these projections? Yesterday. That's impossible. Can I assume that's sarcasm? Yeah. You can. It is. Just get it done. [Crickets chirping] [Aural fractals sound] [Gunfire, men shouting] Man : JD! They found her innocent. Stop it! Right now! JD? You son of a bitch. No, no, no. JD, no! No, stop! He's running our perimeter lines. I thought we should get to know the man in charge of our survival. Yeah, is that how you treat your friends? He's your friend. A man unfaithful to his wife; Left his daughter; And who had a hand in the deaths of hundreds of his own kind. And you... You ask us to trust that? Okay, you need to go. [Exhales] He's just trying to protect us. Yeah, I feel real safe. Heleos. 48 hours, and we were done here. Meaning? Meaning this was supposed to be a pit stop, not a parking lot. When we first got here, it was about you figuring out how to reverse what was happening to you. I don't hear you talking about that anymore. Because I don't even know if I can reverse it. You've stopped trying! These people, they aren't like us. All right? They are unknown. And what am I? Am I an unknown? You need to figure out which world you want to live in. You can't have both. Charlie : All right. What do you think? An oldie but a goodie? I'm sick of children's stories. I want something more grown-up, like Lucy would read. Oh, really? Like what? Uh, well... Julie's been reading "Huckleberry Finn." How about that? Really? Julie said she's reading that? It's supposed to be a classic. Very advanced thematically. I want that one. Okay. Got to cater to your audience. ♪ ♪ [Sighs quietly] John and Julie? Did you find it? Yeah. Yeah, I found it. I'm sorry about that. With Ares. JD has been... nothing but kind, helpful and generous. I know he's unhappy here. And you're wondering if you should be here... or with Ethan. You see? See, you are in my head. You know my thoughts and my feelings, and that's what I don't want. You can control what's happening to you, Molly. The headaches, the urges. You see that they've already started to recede. I don't know what I am. Yes, you do. And your best chance of survival is embracing that. Why are you still awake? Why aren't you powered down? I was bored. You get bored easily. Whose Pyxis Cube is that? It's Julie's. There's no photos of you on it. Only... John Woods. Was that her boyfriend? [Wry chuckle] Seems so, huh? But wasn't that Molly Woods' husband? [Laughs softly] You really don't learn by experience, do you? Are you making fun of me? Me? No. Sorry. I get surly when I drink. My heart gets pummeled. I'm sorry for your pain. Well, you know, that's the thing about humans. We all want what we can't have. Humanichs are like that, too. Yeah? What do you want that you can't have? Lucy... Sometimes you like to remind me that I'm just a machine. You're not just a machine; You know that. The more human experience you give me, the more human I become. I can be so much more if you let me. Wait, hold on. Wait. Wait, this is... this is illegal. It's like misuse of government property or something. Is that all I am? Property? No. Of course not. I want to feel what humans feel. Oh, my God, I could go to jail. Only if someone tells. Wai-Wai-Wait. No, no, wait. Wait. Come on, wait. [Charlie panting] Don't you like me, Charlie? That's not the point. This just can't happen for so many reasons... [Pants] I'm sorry. You need to go power down, and I... I need to go pour out the rest of this drink. [Exhales] We have task forces combing every hot spot Taylor gave us. Still no trace of where the hybrids are hiding out. We haven't lost yet. No? With schools, banks and business districts still shuttered, there is outrage over the disruption of everyday lives. With public pressure mounting to end this lockdown, there is still no word on the whereabouts of former astronaut Molly Woods and her accomplice, disgraced war veteran JD Richter. They're fighting this thing like a war. But it's not a war, it's a scourge. We're running out of time. We need to get personal. Meaning? Everyone has their Achilles' heel. What do they want? Even JD Richter. Newswoman : With this lockdown due to end in 24 hours, will the GSC dare to extend it and risk rioting in the streets? And in another twist, Kelsey Richter, daughter of suspected terrorist JD Richter and circuit court judge Dorothy Richter, was taken into custody today... What the hell? under the Loyalty Act. So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow, and then along came... a hunter... named Orion. And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself, so he chased them to the ends of the earth. But just when he thought he had them trapped, the most powerful god in the universe, Zeus... came along to rescue them. You came to rescue us from the hunters. Are you a god? No. None of us are gods. But you're still what Daddy says you are. And what is that? Our leader. We have to talk. How can they do that? That BS about aiding a terror cell. There's no depth Shepherd and his cronies won't sink to. He just wants to get your attention. He got it. What are you gonna do? I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution. I can't. I won't. I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. Seriously, man, you gonna stop me? Ares. He knows our location. He could lead them straight to us. You don't know me very well. I know humans. And I'm not about to bet our futures on your professed loyalty. JD, don't! Ares, stop it! This is not a prison. He's free to go. Yeah, he's going. Hey! Get away from there! Get away! I thought by now you'd have some intel on where the hybrids might be hiding. Taalr : So did I, General. But to my surprise, initial sat-scans came up negative. So, what, we have nothing? Not yet. But I am currently exploring a new theory. I'm listening. In order to find life, perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it. Meaning? If the hybrids could emit an EMP powerful enough, they could create a thermal hole in my sat-scans. A blind spot. Precisely. Which would allow them to hide in plain sight. What am I looking at? Osgood Listening Station. Closed in 2025 due to defense budget cuts. This is an old satellite image of the area. This was shot this morning. Something is blocking my scans, something that wasn't there six months ago. Gated... tunnel systems, easily defendable... Well, this has to be it. What's your recommendation? Release the virus in conjunction with the deployment of the Humanichs army. And if we withheld release of the virus? In 6.5 months, the Homo sapiens genome will be diluted to the point that an extinction event is inevitable. [Alarm sounds] Charlie, what is that? You're being called up. Ethan : Lucy, are you leaving? Yes, I have to go now. This early? When will you be back? I'm not sure. I've, uh, been called into duty to fulfill my programming. Is Lucas going? Yes. Can't I come with you? Come with me? Ethan, do you think I want to go to war? I want to stay here and play video games and go outside, but that is not my function... is it, Charlie? So, no, Ethan, you can't come with me. You're not like us. You never will be. Hey. I'm sorry about last night. Don't worry. At least not today. We have reason to believe the target is located at the coordinates currently being uploaded to your nav system. Lucy, you will lead the recon op. Sir? At 0700... you and a subordinate will infiltrate the area. You will gather intel on the hybrids' position, numbers and defensive capabilities. Keep your distance. Do not engage the enemy. Understood? Yes, General. I'm sorry. I know this is hard for you. You're doing the right thing. Molly's made her choice. Now we've made ours. Toby. I've also made a choice. I've put in for a transfer. To D.C. I think it's best. For both of us. If that's what you want. It's not, but... If I stay here, I'm never gonna get what I want. ♪ ♪ Hey, will you do me a favor and hand me that screwdriver? So you're leaving. Yeah, soon as I get my truck running. I'm sorry to see you go. You might be the only one. I appreciate what you've done for us, JD. I know it hasn't been easy. You're a good man. I wouldn't go that far. Do me a favor, all right? Keep your eyes open. Stay alert. These guys aren't gonna stop looking for you until they find you. Understood. [Engine starts] [Engine revs, turns off] Molly, I, uh... I can't desert my daughter. You don't owe me an explanation. No, I... probably do. Just know that I hate deserting you. We're doing what we have to do. Maybe in another life... things could have been different. In that other life, you have two PhDs and a ticket to space. And I'm just a bum watching you in a ticker-tape parade. Thank you. For everything. In another life. In another life, Molly Woods. Yeah. [Engine starts] Our orders are "recon only." That's Molly Woods. We may never get a clean shot at her again. They must have a reason for their orders. The element of surprise will be lost. Heleos : Who are you? Hi. I'm Lucy. This is, uh, my friend Lucas. We're just out here deer hunting. We lost the buck we were chasing. You're not humans. What are you? Take him. General Shepherd, we found them. All of them.
