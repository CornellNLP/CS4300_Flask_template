 Previously on "Blood & Oil"... 
 We have a deal... 
 Immunity of any past indiscretions in exchange for... 
 A digital confession from your father that links him to the stolen report. 
 This phone is an exact replica of Hap's. 
 The only difference is the FBI has this one bugged. 
 You've got to distract him long enough to make the switch. 
 Consider it done. 
 I haven't been telling you the whole truth. 
 There was this new play with Hap's ex-wife. 
 He flew me down to Houston to seal the deal, that's all. - To Houston? 
 I didn't want to tell you until the deal was done. 
 So you lie to me instead? 
 I'm gonna go stay with Jules for a while. 
 Oh, my God. Jules! 
 Jules! Wake up! 
 I never should have sold you that report. 
 You will do what's necessary, or you'll go down, too. 
 FBI! 
 Carla Briggs, you're under arrest.

 [Buzzer sounds] 
 [Door opens, hinges creak] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hi, babe. 
 Hey. 
 Leave it to you... Even make jail look glamorous. 
 Mm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How are you holding up? 
 I'll be fine. 
 Nothing a warm bath and a mimosa won't cure. 
 Uh, the feds... 
 They say they have a recording of you. 
 Do you know what you said? 
 I was talking that weasel Myron off the ledge, and I got careless. 
 I must have said something inflammatory enough to land me here. 
 Well, I've got a whole team working on your release. 
 Carter thinks their recording of you is outside the scope of the warrant, so he's pretty confident that everything will get thrown out and all the charges dropped. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hap, what about the FBI bug? 
 It's probably still in the house. 
 How do you think it got it in? 
 I'm working on that, too. 
 My father's wife? 
 It was supposed to be Hap. 
 I'm not at liberty to speak with you about ongoing investigations. 
 Well, that wasn't the deal, okay? 
 The reason I agreed to work for you people was to take my father down. 
 No, the reason why you agreed to work with "us people" was for immunity from prosecution, which we awarded you. 
 So as far as I'm concerned, our business with you is finished. 
 Unless, of course, you would like for us to look deeper into all of the unsolved crime in Rock Springs. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Beep] 
 Wick : Hello? 
 It's Cody. 
 Jules is in the hospital. You need to come down here. 
 Your security detail went over every inch of your house when you were gone, and they still can't find the listening device. 
 It's got to be here... Somewhere. 
 Everybody that came in or out went through security. 
 Maybe it's somebody on your staff. 
 No. 
 My team vetted everyone. 
 I mean, there's got to be somebody who wasn't checked. 
 Ahh. 
 Me and Carla, but we didn't go through security. 
 [Scoffs] We know it wasn't her. 
 [Wand whirring] 
 [Beep] 
 [Beep] 
 Son of a bitch. 
 They cloned my phone. 
 How'd that happen? 
 ♪ 
 Jules. You want to come join me? 
 I'll be right there. 
 I know. 
 ♪ 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I, uh, brought you these. 
 Calla Lilies. 
 My favorite. 
 You know it's harder to find Calla Lilies in Rock Springs than it is to hit a gusher? 
 I mean, who knew? 
 I was thinking... if we just quit the whole oil business, start a chain of florists, what do you think? 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I know I screwed up, all right, in more ways than one. 
 And, uh, I just want you to know that I love you, and that you're still my wife, and I just want you to come home. 
 Please. 
 I told you, Billy. I just... I need some time. 
 Yeah, but we can't fix anything if we're apart. 
 Yeah, but I can't fix it if we're together. 
 So just... just give me some time, please. 
 Yeah. 
 Sure. Whatever you need. 
 [Static] 
 Hap Briggs' phone just went dead. 
 He must have found the bug. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 D.C. wants an update. 
 I'll be back. 
 ♪ 
 [Car horns honking] 
 When I agreed to aid this investigation, I only had three stipulations. 
 Don't get my son involved, don't let Hap Briggs get off easy, and handle the... 
 Get you the U.S.G.S. Report before it was admitted into evidence. 
 Your terms couldn't have been clearer, Ms. Briggs. 
 Well, you failed to come through on the first two. 
 So hand over the report, and we'll call it even. 
 I wasn't able to get it. 
 Hap's lawyers are playing hardball. 
 But don't worry. 
 I'm still on it. 
 You still on it is what has me worried. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I thought you two had broken up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, isn't this a picture? 
 You're both here. Great. 
 I must have fallen asleep waiting on the big reunion. 
 Wait a minute. You're... you're okay? 
 I thought... 
 You thought what, Hap? 
 That I tried to kill myself over one of you two? 
 In your narcissistic dreams. 
 But Cody said that you... 
 Cody's a friend. 
 She's worried about me. She thinks I'm in denial. 
 But the truth is, I was pissed off at the both of you, so I drank too much and took a couple pills, all right? 
 I'm just a lightweight. 
 So you're okay. 
 Yep. Fine. 
 And I'm about to be a whole lot finer [scoffs] Once I get a few things off my chest. 
 First things first, Wick knows about us. 
 And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he forgives you. 
 Wick? 
 I don't. 
 Which is why he asked me to bug you for the feds. 
 He's trying to put you in jail. 
 Well... I'd expect that from you, sadly. 
 But what's your angle? 
 Well, Wick here enlightened me to the fact that I'm not the only woman you've been screwing. 
 Apparently, there is quite a list. 
 I don't know why you're smiling. 
 With your lies, you're as bad as he is. 
 Jules, you should have talked to me. 
 I am done talking to you, Hap. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 And now that the air is clear, I'm feeling surprisingly better, so the two of you can take your manipulative asses and get out of my room. 
 Go on. 
 Go to hell. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, you're the one that got her to do it, huh? 
 Wick, now is not the time to be walking away from me. 
 What kind of a son did I raise that betrays his father? 
 You were sleeping with my girlfriend! 
 Do you understand that?! 
 She cared about me, and you sabotaged it. 
 It was the one thing that I cared about, and you... you had to ruin it, didn't you? 
 My relationship with Jules started a long time ago, and it had nothing to do with you. 
 Why do you think I tried to get you to end it with her? 
 I wanted to avoid causing you any pain. 
 Do you listen to yourself? 
 Do you believe the words that you say? 
 I wanted to make you pay for all the times that you made me feel like crap. 
 I wanted to see you rot in jail. 
 [Laughs] 
 And you even screwed that up. 
 Yeah. 
 Because your wife took the bullet for you. 
 You don't need to bring my wife into it. 
 Okay, then how about your daughter? 
 How about Lacey? 
 How do you think she's gonna feel about you after she finds out you were sleeping with my girlfriend, huh? 
 You are an old man, Hap, blessed with one gift... 
 Finding oil where people can't. 
 You know, at some point, you're gonna look back on your life and the only thing you're gonna see is oil, the only thing that you love and maybe the only thing that loved you back. 
 Well, at least it didn't disappoint me.

 Tip : Always in the middle of it, ain't you, Wick? 
 [Keyboard keys clacking] 
 Damn. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Beep] 
 Hey, Tip. 
 Give me the good news. 
 Tip : There is no good news. 
 I've been forced to close the case on the rig fire. 
 Why? 
 Well, I'll tell you, but you're not gonna like it. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey. What's up, man? Hey. 
 Can I speak to my mother? 
 Yeah, come on in. 
 Annie : Wick! 
 Hi. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Dad knows. 
 I had it out with him. We're done. 
 So if your offer still stands, I'm in. 
 Well, of course it does. 
 I'm so happy to hear this. 
 Billy, Emma, say hello to our newest partner. 
 Welcome aboard, man. Thanks. 
 Emma's our geologist. 
 Hey. Wick. 
 Hey. 
 Well, hopefully, you're the man who can answer our riddle. 
 We bought the piece of land next to your father's, but it turns out both parcels are bone-dry. 
 Are you sure? 
 I mean, all my dad ever talked about was how this land was gonna be the play of his lifetime. 
 Yeah, well, what does he know that we don't? 
 The U.S.G.S. Survey. 
 Yeah, all roads seems to lead back to that, don't they? 
 Did you ever see it? 
 No. I wish I did. 
 He never trusted me enough to let me fully in. 
 Well, I'm just thrilled you're with us. 
 And don't worry. 
 We'll get our answers another way. 
 I'm gonna tell you something, Lacey, and you're not gonna want to hear it. 
 Wick was the mole. 
 No. 
 Daddy, you're wrong. 
 He promised me that he would never help the feds. 
 He lied. 
 He admitted it to me himself. 
 In fact, he took great pleasure in telling me. 
 Why? 
 Why would he do that? 
 Well, he's going to tell you that it's because I'm evil and that he found out that I... 
 [Sighs] 
 Have a relationship with Jules. 
 What? 
 Yes. 
 He's gonna try and spin this in the worst way, Lacey, but the truth is, my involvement with Jules started a long time ago. 
 I'm not perfect. 
 I admit that. 
 I don't know. Maybe I'm also angry about this. 
 What is this? 
 That's the police report from the rig heist. 
 Wick is the one who stole from me and left me there to die in the rig fire. 
 But there's no proof. 
 This is still unsolved. 
 It's unsolved because Tip found out that the feds gave Wick immunity. 
 Now, why would Wick need immunity if he wasn't guilty? 
 I just don't believe that he could do this to you. 
 Dad, immunity can be granted for anything. 
 Maybe the feds think that he was involved with the stolen U.S.G.S. Survey. 
 Maybe it has nothing to do with the rig robbery. 
 Maybe. 
 God, you two are always looking for the worst in each other, and it's got to stop. 
 If you knew for certain that Wick had nothing to do with that night, could you forgive him? 
 I could try. 
 Then I'm gonna prove it to you. 
 Jules : Cody. Oh, thank God. I am dying to get out of here. 
 This place is full of sick people, not to mention the patients. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, luckily for you, as soon as your discharge papers are ready, I can take you home. 
 Aww, I'm about to leave. 
 You didn't have to get me flowers. 
 These aren't for you. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughing] Oh, okay. 
 Sorry. 
 Billy brought them to the pharmacy. 
 Mm, really? 
 He... apologized, and, uh... 
 Well... 
 He asked me to come home. 
 Yeah? What did you say? 
 I told him I needed time to think. 
 [Sighs] I don't know, Jules. 
 It's just with all the lies he's been telling. 
 He's just lost, you know? 
 This town does that to people, Cody. 
 So don't make a mistake you'll regret. 
 Good guys... they are in short supply around here. 
 Take it from me. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, Jules. 
 You got it. 
 [Scoffs] Where is that nurse? 
 I feel like your discharge papers were supposed to be ready about an hour ago. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Updating your Facebook status? 
 Or are you swiping right on your new tinder match? 
 Uh, excuse me? 
 See, I'm trying to figure out what is so compelling to distract you from the cancer patient in room 323 who's been waiting for a fentanyl patch for the past half-hour. 
 I don't think that I'm the person you're looking for. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Let me guess. 
 You're on break. 
 Wow. The downfall of society in a nutshell... 
 Nurses who care more about their Instagram feed than their patients. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, for your information, doc, I'm not a nurse. 
 I'm a pharmacist, and I don't have Instagram. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 But if your cancer patient's in pain, you should prescribe her morphine in an I.V. Drip with a pain button. 
 She'll get relief four times faster than she would with a patch. 
 I see you've met my friend Cody. 
 Cody, this is my doctor, Alex white. 
 Oh. 
 Well, that explains why you want to go home.

 When pressed, you'll remember that you left her alone long enough to steal the report. 
 Myron : You want me to alter state records and commit perjury? 
 Have you lost your damn mind, Carla? 
 Oh, now you have a conscience? [Beep] Annie : Heard enough? What do you think happens when Hap hears this recording? My husband loves me. He'll understand that what I was doing was necessary to protect us. Carla, there are only two things that Hap loves more than his wives... His money and his kids. If you think he's gonna welcome you home after he hears this recording, then you don't know how an alley fight with Hap Briggs ends. What do you want? Give me the U.S.G.S. Report. I'll get you out of here, and Hap will never hear this recording. You have that kind of power? What do you think? Give it some thought. It's not every day someone hands you a "get out of jail" card. Literally. [Buzzer sounds, door opens] [Keys jingling] [Lock disengages] [Keys clatter, door closes] Billy : Cody, hey. Hi. What's going on? What are you doing? I thought about what you said, and I think you're right. Taking time apart isn't the answer. We need to be together to work through this. [Sighs] That's great, babe, but, uh... Billy, I finally found the last two cold beers at the back... [Clears throat] Oh. Yeah. Oh. Uh, Cody, this is... This is Emma. And, uh, Emma, this is my wife, Cody. Hi. I've heard so much about you. I'm Billy's new partner. New partner? Mm-hmm. Wow, a lot's changed in the last 24 hours, huh? Well, I'm not new, actually. I'm Clifton's granddaughter from the land auction and the trip to Houston. Huh, Houston. Mm-hmm. I'm guessing he didn't tell you about me. No, he did not. No, I haven't, but, uh, I was gonna talk to you about it. I actually think I understand. No. No, you don't. Emma's a geologist. That's all she is, just a geologist. And Emma's leaving. Cody, just so that you know... There's nothing going on between us. Nothing more than trying to beat Hap. Yep. She's right. That's the, uh... That's the truth. There's nothing going on. I'm sure it is. But if it's not an issue, then why didn't you tell me about the hot geologist? [Chuckles] Cody. No, and why neglect to tell me that you flew to Houston with her? You are blowing this way out of proportion. No. No, I'm actually trying to save our marriage, and I just keep finding more lies. Well, if you'd let me explain it to you... How do you not get this? The fact that you have to keep explaining things... That's the problem. That's why we're broken. [Sighs] [Door slams] You know, I thought Hap would have poisoned you against me for what I did. Well, you got Carla out of the house, so it wasn't all bad. Look. I know dad's always been hard on you, and I've never listened to him. You know that. But you lied to me. If you'd put dad in jail, I mean, I wouldn't be talking to you. If you only knew what he did than you would... I know. He told me. About Jules. Yeah, it's horrible. It's unforgivable. [Sighs] He said that he did it because he was angry at you about the rig fire. What do you mean? I mean, he thought that you had something to do with what happened that night. [Scoffs] So that's why you invited me here. To play "good cop"? [Scoffs] No. Is that it? No! I invited you here because I want the truth. So tell me. Did you do it? [Laughs] He sleeps with my girlfriend, and you take his side. I'm... no, this isn't about taking sides. All that bull about having my back. You've never had my back. You had Hap's back. That is not true. I'm just... I'm just giving you an opportunity to come clean. Just tell me. What really happened that night? You are definitely his daughter. 
 
 ♪ Well, I've been back-channeling this judge. So, Sam, you're my lawyer. You tell me how hard is it to set a new bail hearing? Carla : He can't because I'm already home. I'll call you back. [Telephone receiver clicks] How'd you get out? Hap, what's going on? I thought you'd be happy to see me. [Laughing] Well, I... I've been working with the lawyers day and night to try and get you a new bail hearing, and you walk in here free as a bird. The feds over-reached. It turns out their warrant precluded them from recording anyone but you, so they had no choice but to send me on my way. Tell me the truth, Carla. Did you cut a deal? A deal? No, Hap. Don't you see? They want you to be suspicious of me. That's why they did it this way. They want you to turn on me. You know how they work. Luckily for us, they underestimate the strength of our relationship. I'm your wife and your partner. And you love me. I do. They're coming for us, Hap. Your ex-wife, too. She is relentless. No one is more aware of that than me, Carla. I've decided to expedite plans on McCutching. I was hoping you'd say that. We're gonna drill 24/7 before Annie gets her hands on that survey. Well, thanks for waiting. How'd you get that survey? What survey? All right, so here it is. If this is Hap's parcel and this is ours... Then this is the oil. 70 billion barrels worth of beautiful black crude. 70 billion? That would make it... The biggest untapped oil reserve in the world, located under the Black Elk Reservation... Hap : Here. But that's sacred land. The tribal council will never let us put rigs there. That's what Hap was banking on, which is why he bought the land next door. No doubt he was planning on slant-drilling. Right under the reservation, we siphon out their oil with our straw from our land. The reservation remains pristine, and we all get rich. But we would still need the rights. Don't you worry about that. We'll get them. And when we do, we will be... The richest oil family in the country. All we have to do is persuade the chief... That we are the only partners that can drill that oil, and this is her. Hap : Chief Elaine Whitecloud. I've got a meeting with her tonight. So put the champagne on ice. 'Cause we're this close to the pot of gold. Cody : She's this drop-dead gorgeous woman in my house getting my husband a beer like it was the most natural thing in the world. All right, come on, Cody. Do you really think something's going on between them? I don't know. They've been working together for weeks. If there was nothing going on, then why wouldn't he tell me about her?

The oil business is not for the faint of heart. You think Hap Briggs became Hap Briggs by playing nice? [Scoffs] Ask my grandfather. You're gonna be a success some day. I knew it from the moment you tried to con Clifton out of his nest egg. [Chuckles] You need to do it your way. Trust your gut. Trust your instincts. Don't give up on yourself, Billy. You can't give up on him, Cody, or your marriage. But what do I know? I'm just an E.R. doctor with a poor bedside manner. [Laughs] That's true. Thank you. For what? For being a friend. Just when I needed one. Oh, I should probably go back inside now. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Yeah. Here's a good idea. Annie's expecting us, so why don't you get yourself some black coffee? Come meet us when you're ready. Yeah, sounds like a... Sounds like a good idea. But, uh, hey. Uh... thank you. For what? Just listening. You know, being here. It means a lot. It's my pleasure. It's nice to talk about things other than oil derricks for a change. Yeah, ain't that the truth. ♪ I told you. Those photos reveal nothing. Come on. Let's go get dinner. It's on me. Lacey, what... What is that? You can't see anything. It's just a watch. That watched belonged to my grandfather. I'm sorry, Lacey. I'm sorry. God, how could he do this? He almost killed our father. You always said you wanted to know the truth, right? Not this truth. [Cellphone chimes] That's dad. He wants us at the tack room for a meeting with that chief. Now that you know, what are you gonna do? You know, Carla, it's a lot more fun on my side of the table. You're welcome to join any time. Hard to imagine anybody could be happier without you, isn't it? [Clears throat] S-sorry we're late. Yeah, what'd we miss? The fireworks are just getting started. Well, hello, Billy. Hap. If it isn't Hap's pride and joy. Well, if it isn't the original evil step-monster? [Giggles] Hey, Annie. Hi, babe. Hi. Well, this is quite a crack team of wildcatters you've put together, Annie. Well, I'll bet on heart and hunger every time. Billy : Why don't you just go ahead and underestimate us again, Hap? That's always worked out well for you. Elaine : Why does it seem like I'm about to sit down with the Hatfields and the McCoys? Lacey : Oh, don't worry. We're nothing like them. We just turn on each other. Hap : Everybody say hello to Chief Elaine Whitecloud. And speaking of family, where is this son of yours? He'll be here any moment. Promise. I actually believed him when he said there was nothing going on between them. I feel like such an idiot. Hey. Don't do that to yourself. [Sighs] Maybe it's all a misunderstanding, and this is just gonna be a funny story you'll end up telling your kids someday. Yeah. Maybe. For what it's worth... [Sighs] If you were my wife, the only use I'd have for another woman would be to tell her how amazing you are. Thank you, Alex. [Inhales sharply] I got to get out of here. [Laughs] Yeah. Good night. Good night. [Door opens] Finally. Here's my son. W-w-wait a minute. He... he's your son? Yes. Dr. Alex White, meet everyone. Hap : Doctor. Hap Briggs. Alex : Pleasure. Jules? So much for a fun girls' night out, huh? Yeah, sorry I disappeared on you. What'd I miss? Uh... The end of my marriage. What's wrong? [Sniffles] Um... [Laughs] When, uh, Alex said he needed to see me, it was to tell me that I'm... Pregnant. What? And I don't know if it's Hap's or Wick's. I'm sorry. [Sobs] It's okay.
