 Previously on "Blood & Oil"...  
 Wick knows about us, which is why he asked me to bug you for the feds. 
 You were there at the rig fire. 
 I've gone through the photos a dozen times. 
 It's just a watch. 
 That watch belonged to my grandfather. 
 God, how could he do this? 
 If I don't give these people what they want, they're gonna kill my son. 
 70 billion barrels. 
 Located under the Black Elk reservation. 
 So you're here to see Chief Whitecloud, too? 
 Great minds. 
 It's not every day two oil companies come chasing after our mineral rights. 
 ♪ 
 Alex : If you were my wife, the only use I'd have for another woman would be to tell her how amazing you are. 
 Thank you, Alex. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 What? 
 And I don't know if it's Hap's or Wick's. 
 ♪ I got 99 people ♪ 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ Tell me 99 things ♪ 
♪ I got 99 reasons ♪ 
 Good morning, Hap. 
 It's a beautiful day, isn't it? 
 Annie, any day I close a $1 trillion deal, it's a beautiful day. 
 Chief Whitecloud called you here, too? 
 Well, yeah. 
 Only to sign the largest oil deal in American history. 
 Oh, here she comes. 
 So be graceful in defeat. 
 It is Christmas. 
 ♪ 
 Hi. 
 Annie. 
 Hi, Elaine. 
 Hap. 
 Sorry for the short notice. 
 I wanted you both to hear this from me. 
 We're not going with either of you. 
 What? 
 You're not taking any outside bids? 
 We're not saying no. 
 We just need to explore all of our options. 
 Thanks for your understanding. 
 [Music continues] 
 And thank you, Annie Briggs, for costing me $1 trillion. 
 I'll have my accountant send you the bill. 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ 
 You're sure this was Hap's cup? 
 Positive. 
 It's about time I got some answers, eh? 
 [Chatter] 
 Cody : Relax, Jules. 
 As long as the baby's healthy, everything else will work itself out. 
 I promise. 
 Right. 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 Cody. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Nice... this is a nice surprise. How are you? 
 I'm good. 
 Sorry to interrupt this little reunion, but if we could... 
 Right. 
 Of course. 
 Sorry. 
 I have good news, Jules. 
 You have a perfectly healthy baby. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 And the paternity result? 
 The lab ran some tests on the DNA samples you brought in for both men. 
 So when you're ready... 
 Here are the preliminary results. 
 ♪ 
 Excuse me, I need a moment. 
 [Door opens] 
 ♪ 
 Thank you for everything. 
 I don't know what she'd do without you. 
 You know I'm here for both of you. 
 ♪ 
 I'm gonna go find Jules. 
 [Door closes] 
 Come on. Let's get you home. 
 ♪ 
 Excuse me. 
 I'd like the medical file on a patient named Jules Jackman. 
 ♪ 
 Brigitte, I want garland hung from every mantel. 
 The house needs to be ready for the family party tomorrow night. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Excuse me. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 I told you not to call unless you had something. 
 Well, I definitely have something for you. 
 Check your in-box, Mrs. Briggs. 
 [Footsteps] 
 Cody. 
 [Sighs] 
 Sorry, I just came to get some of my stuff. 
 You shouldn't be moving out. You should be coming home. 
 Don't you think it'd be a little crowded here with your girlfriend? 
 My girlfriend? 
 Emma. 
 The one you were kissing last night at the Tack Room. 
 Cody... 
 No, no, no, Cody, listen. 
 I... we were drinking. 
 I was pissed off, okay, and she... 
 I mean, she kissed me, you know. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I know that sounds ridiculous. 
 I mean, I saw you go off with Alex. 
 I didn't know what to think. 
 Well, we're friends. 
 And unlike you, I don't need to fall into the arms of someone else to make myself feel better. 
 ♪ 
 [Sighs] 
 How did we get here? 
 I don't know. 
 I think it's this place. 
 [Sighs] 
 It takes everything that's good and turns it bad, you know? 
 Every deal becomes some opportunity to use someone, and every opportunity becomes another chance to screw someone over. 
 ♪ 
 You know, sometimes, I just... 
 Think I was happier in Florida. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Even with the yellow flies and hurricane season? 
 [Laughs] 
 The truth is, I'd give anything to go back to that version of me. 
 Of us. 
 ♪ 
 Then... 
 Why don't we? 
 ♪ 
 I'm willing to take another chance on you. 
 On us. 
 ♪ 
 Look, if that's not what you want, then you just... You really got to be honest now. 
 No, I do. 
 It is what I want. I just... 
 ♪ 
 I got to tie up some loose ends. 
 Okay. 
 ♪ 
 Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. 
 I'll be at the Tack Room at midnight, bags packed, car loaded. 
 If you're not there, I'm leaving without you. 
 It's now or never, because I'm not looking back. 
 ♪ 
 [Sighs] 
 [Beeps] 
 Hey, Lace. 
 Hi, Dad. 
 Well, that was a hell of a morning on the reservation deal, wasn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 You're not here to talk about the deal, are you? 
 I have to tell you something, Dad. 
 You okay, kid? 
 I know that look. 
 It doesn't mean good news. 
 Dad, um... 
 I'm sorry to interrupt, but something's happened. 
 What's up, A.J.? 
 It's the Saudis. 
 I think they killed my son. 
 ♪ 
 I miss you, Dad. 
 A.J. : I miss you, too, Khalid. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too, daddy. 
 [Shouting in Arabic] 
 [Whistle blows] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Gunshot] ♪ [Sighs] That was 30 minutes ago. Then the link went dead. I mean, they must know I'm working for you... otherwise... A.J., you don't know anything for sure yet. ♪ Play that back, just the last part. [Cellphone beeps] I love you, too, daddy. [Shouting in Arabic] [Whistle blows] There. [Screaming] I know that sound. That's the shift-change whistle. Out at one of the rigs. They don't blow whistles at the rigs in Saudi Arabia. Your son isn't in Saudi Arabia, because that's one of my rigs. Right here in Rock Springs. And if he's here, we're gonna find him. Zager, get me security. Loop in the sheriff. ♪ [Knock on door] Carla, hey. May I come in? Sure. I-i guess. You're looking surprisingly well, considering. All right, Carla, I'm not in the mood for your games today. So if you don't mind, I've got work to do. You're a lot of things, Jules, but I would have never pegged you as unoriginal. Getting knocked up just to keep your man? A little trite, isn't it? How the hell do you know about that? The question is, does my husband know he's gonna father another child? I'm assuming you're not here to help plan the baby shower. Jules: So what are you here for, Carla? To threaten me? To make you an offer. I will pay you 50% over market value for the Tack Room. [Laughs] And provide a generous allowance for you and your child for the rest of your lives. In exchange, you move away, you never speak to Hap again, and you never tell him about your baby. So you want to buy me, right? Is that it? Come on, Carla. What makes you think I would even consider taking a penny of your money? Because you betrayed Hap, and he hates you for it. And when he finds out about the baby, he'll sue you for custody and he'll win. Chances are, you will never see your child again. Think about my offer, Jules. You won't get a better one. ♪ Thank you. [Cellphone beeps] You were right, Hap. Audio forensics just confirmed the match. Mr. Menendez, your recording matches the whistle that's right here on the eastern side of Briggs Oil company. How long before you find that boy? I don't know. We checked every home within earshot of that rig. Right now we're onto this area right here, which is the last quadrant. Man : Alpha team leader to Sheriff Hamilton, come in. Excuse me. Sergeant. We're at 122 River Walk. Lights and TV are on inside. No one's answering the door. Okay, back off. Maintain surveillance. I'm on my way. What... y-you think my son is there? Well, we're about to find out. Why don't you come along? I'll call you guys. ♪ Hey. I, um, I brought this for the kids.  Oh, nice. I guess I'll just leave them here?  Nurse : That's fine. Alex : Cody. Hi. You didn't have to do this. Oh, I remember you saying the kids in your clinic didn't have a lot of toys, and it's Christmas. Every kid should get to open a present. Well, thank you. That's very thoughtful of you. Sure. I-I'm glad you're here. I wanted to tell you that I'm going to be going away for a while. Really? Why? A friend of mine called. He's with Doctors Without Borders. They're short staffed for the holidays. In Haiti. Wow. I'm going to help my mother get everything in order here first with the oil deal. But when I spoke to him, he said they could use a good pharmacist on the team. [Chuckles] I... I can't, Alex. I actually... I'm leaving, too. ♪ Billy agreed to leave Rock Springs and go home. Well, you must have been very persuasive. I think Billy finally realized there's more to life than oil. Well, it's a big loss. There aren't many women like you in this town. Thank you. [Sighs] ♪ Bye. Goodbye. ♪ Moving into position. ♪ Go. ♪ Open door on the left! Staircase, right! Room, clear. Clear. Clear.  Entering back room. ♪ Suspect! Stand up slowly. Turn around. Face me. Drop the weapon. Turn around. Face me. ♪ Drop the weapon. Echo. Suspect dead. Repeat... suspect is dead.  A.J. : It's Van Ness! Sh-she's Saudi intelligence! She's the one that has my son! A.J., wait! Khalid! Khalid! Whoa.  My son! Easy.  Did you find my son? We haven't found your son. They killed my boy!  No! Listen to me...  Khalid! Listen to me, listen to me. I need you to go back to the truck, understand? [Thud] You hear that? Call again. Okay. Khalid! [Thud] Come with me. This way. Come, come, come. ♪ Call him again. Khalid. Khalid! [Thud] Khalid, if that's you, I need you to come out very, very slowly, Khalid. ♪ Daddy. Khalid! Daddy. ♪ [Siren wails] Man : Coming out. [Siren continues] [Police radio chatter] Right this way. We'll take care of you. [Indistinct shouting] [Vehicle door opens] [Knock on door] [Sighs] Alex. Do you have a minute? [Sighs] To, uh, talk about your team's proposal. Yeah, sure. Come on in. I mean, I'm not sure there's much to talk about. [Chuckles] You're taking outside bids. Cody and I are leaving Rock Springs. We're going home. Wow.  Mm. Um... I'm sorry to hear that. [Sighs] 'Cause I was quite impressed with your bid. [Chuckles] Really? Your numbers were fair, but we're mainly looking for a partner we trust. And I can't help but think that maybe I found that guy. Well, lucky for that guy, I guess, right? Luck has nothing to do with it. I say you earned it. Wait... What, you're gonna give me the mineral rights? You're exactly the type of guy that we need to protect this land while it's drilled. [Sighs] Yeah, well, um... [Clears throat] I already told Cody I'm going back to Florida with her, so I'm not gonna go back on my word again. Yeah, it's a dilemma, isn't it? Yeah. But what if... What if Emma and Wick were your eyes here? I mean, I could oversee the whole operation from Florida. Would that work? No. I need you here, on the ground, front and center. And you're the one that I trust. Look, I get it. You're in a tough spot. Yeah. But if you leave, this deal is off the table. And that's a shame. For about a trillion reasons. ♪ Let me know what you decide. Yeah. ♪ So, what do I do? You tell Alex that we'll take the deal. I mean, Cody will understand. No, no, man. She won't. She'll say I haven't changed and she'll go home without me. Emma? What do you think? I'd like you to stay. I would. [Rock music playing] But that would be me being selfish, so... As your friend, I'd tell you to take your wife and drive out of here as fast as you can. Let us figure out how to salvage the deal. If we can salvage the deal. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Billy. If Cody can't understand that... Emma : Don't listen to him. You'd say anything to beat your father. Don't you think he's gonna feel a little resentful when he's going back to Florida to open up a laundromat instead of building an empire? [Cellphone rings] ♪ Taught every thief all he knows ♪ [Sighs] Unbelievable. What is it? My mother has brought in a new partner. My father. Billy? Hey, Billy. [Door closes] You're working with him? It was a business decision. Why didn't you even ask me first? Alex came by my place today. He wants us to have the mineral rights. He gave them to you, huh? [Sighs] Yeah. Well, this really is cause for celebration. No, not for you. I control this one. All right, without me, this deal is null and void. Billy, you're being unreasonable. There are huge advantages to pooling our resources. No, no. I started to work with you to beat him, not to make him richer. You two are made for each other. This deal is dead. [Door closes] Don't you worry. It'll be a cold day in hell before I let him ruin our deal. 
 
 [Muffled rock music playing] I still can't believe you're actually thinking of accepting Carla's offer. What have I got left? You're leaving and I have hurt everyone I ever cared about. Still thinking about Wick, huh? Oh, you know, only all the time. [Music continues] Well... You can't let Carla run your life, Jules. So, what, I should just stick around here and tussle with Hap over our kid for the rest of my life? No. No, I don't want that. What I want is what you've got. A man who loves me. He'd give up his whole life just to be with me. I'm gonna miss you. Yeah. Really gonna miss you, too. [Music continues] [Knock on door] Hold on a second, I'm coming. What do you want? May I come in, Billy? You have a lovely home. [Scoffs] Yeah, well... It'll be on the market tomorrow. I'm sure you can make a competitive offer. You're gonna leave Rock Springs? Yeah. A man on the verge of closing a $1 trillion deal? Pulling up stakes and going home? I decided I don't want to be here anymore. That don't sound like the Billy LeFever I know. Yeah, well, maybe it took me coming here to realize what's important to me. Who's important. You know what I love about this town? The weather stinks and the sushi will kill you. [Chuckles] But it has one thing to offer. It can make your dreams come true. ♪ That's why thousands of people come here every day. You know what the difference is between them and you? They're still dreaming. Yeah, well... Dreams change. I don't think so. I'm gonna tell you something that you're probably not gonna want to hear, but, uh... We're not so different, you and me. I saw that right from the start. You came into town like I once did, too damn brash and too stupid to even consider failure as an option. [Scoffs] What we had was a dream. Do you know what happens when you abandon your dreams? They don't dry up and blow away. They lodge in your gut and they gnaw at you until there's nothing left. Except the memory of what you once wanted to be. I made a promise to Cody. Cody will understand. In fact, if she really loves you, she'll be right there by your side. And then you know what? You really will be like me, Billy. You'll have it all. ♪ And let there be light. [Laughs] You do love playing God, Hap Briggs. A role that some think that I was born for. Merry Christmas, partner. Merry Christmas. [Chuckles] Wick. Carla : Merry Christmas. Anyone else need a drink? Yes, thank you. Carla : I heard we're all joining forces. Yes, all for the greater good. Speaking of which, has Billy shown up yet? Chief Whitecloud is sending over contracts for Black Elk. If he doesn't show up to sign, our alliance is over before it begins. [Chuckles] If I know my boy Billy, he'll be here. Enjoy. Thank you. ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ 
♪ glory to the newborn king ♪ [Sighs] Well, I'm glad you decided to be the bigger man and come tonight. After everything that he's done to us, how can you just let it go? Pretend like nothing ever happened. That's what families do. They forgive and move on. ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ Hap : Billy! ♪ I'm glad you made it. Sir. Well, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and, um, you're right. I want it all. [Chuckles] I wanted to come and tell you personally. Right, yeah. Um... And you're sure about this? Yes. The technician at the lab said it's highly unusual, but it does happen. Thank you, Dr. White. I want you to call me if you need anything. ♪ [Door opens] [Indistinct conversations, glasses clinking] Alex : Hey.  Mm, hi. Thanks for giving us a moment. No problem. You know, before you go... [Rock music playing] I want to give this to you. A plane ticket. Round trip to Haiti, in case you change your mind about coming. [Chuckles] Or if things with Billy don't work out. [Music continues] ["Deck the halls" playing] [Indistinct conversation] [Music continues] There was a part of me that hoped you'd come to your senses and were long gone with Cody by now. Yeah, well... How am I supposed to walk away from something like this? [Music continues] After I sign the contracts, I'll explain to her that a deal like this makes it possible for us to take care of our families forever. It's not just my dream... It's our dream. Be careful. Sometimes the guys that want it all end up with nothing. [Music continues] [Chuckles] Turned out to be a pretty nice Christmas. Yes, it did. Come here. [Music continues] You look beautiful. Thanks, Dad. You don't look too bad yourself. [Laughs] Yeah. Hey, uh, when you came into my office yesterday, you had something to tell me. What was it? It doesn't matter right now. 'Cause I got the feeling that you were gonna tell me something about Wick. ♪ If something's bothering you about Wick... You got to tell me. Lacey? [Sighs] Dad...

What's so important? ♪ You know, as a parent, you're never really sure that you're doing the right thing for your kids. But sometimes, it becomes abundantly clear... When you've done them wrong. Okay, I think I know where this is going. Look... Wick, just let me finish. ♪ I haven't been a good father to you. Th-there's just no other way to explain it. I'm sorry for that. But you need to explain something to me. What do you mean, explain? How could you put a gun in my face? Dad, what are you... How's that feel, Wick? To be looking down the barrel of a gun and somebody that you love is pointing it at your face. I know how that feels, don't I, Wick? ♪ Don't I? Yeah. You know how that feels. ♪ But what are you gonna do? Are you gonna shoot me? ♪ [Sighs] No. ♪ [Gun thuds] ♪ You've been crying out for my attention your whole life. I never gave it to you. Not in the way you needed. So if you pointed a gun at my face, there's only one reason. I pushed you into it. ♪ Forgive me, Wick. So that I can forgive you. [Voice breaking] And we can move forward. ♪ [Voice breaking] Yeah, I forgive you. ♪ Lacey : I bet you and Khalid are happy to be going back home. We talked about it, and, um... And we decided we're already home. What I'm trying to say is, Khalid and I would love to stay here in Rock Springs. But what about your wife? Ex-wife. As soon as the papers come through.

[Cellphone beeps] Thanks for getting back to me. Yes, it is. Let's have some champagne. So, this is the moment where you run off and convince the girl that she can have it all, right? [Sighs] Yeah.
