 Previously on "Blood & Oil"... 
 I'm not one of the dudes who robbed Hap Briggs. 
 That boy had a partner. 
 Was Wick with you at the siphon job? 
 No. Neither of us were. 
 He finds out the truth, he's gonna come back to kill me. 
 You need to disappear. 
 Hap : Come work for me. 
 Briggs Oil needs you. 
 You got something. 
 Ada's married. 
 I don't want you messing things up around here for any of us, so keep it professional. 
 There's nothing I'd love more than to see you openly, but we can't do that to Wick. 
 So, what are we doing here, Hap? 
 I have a chance to prove that I'm worthy of my greatest privilege... you. 
 All : Hear, hear! Hear, hear! 
 I need your help. 
 Okay, you know the oil business better than anybody. 
 Please, just teach me. 
 I'll get back what Hap took from us. 
 'Cause I know how much you hate him. 
 Dr. Kipling : So, how have you been feeling? 
 Oh, you know, I've just been really... pregnant. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 I've been working double shifts at the pharmacy, and so I barely sleep anymore, which is fine, because it gives me plenty of time to plan and organize, which are two different things entirely. 
 And I hear some pregnant women talk a lot, but that's not happening to me, so... 
 Yeah, we're lucky that hasn't happened yet. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, all of it is normal. 
 And all of it symptoms of this little miracle. 
 [Heartbeat] Oh, my God. We made that. Him. It's a boy. [Chuckling] He's very healthy. Yeah. He... he's, uh he's perfect. [Chuckles] Hey, I have an idea. We should have a housewarming party. Mm-hmm. Meet our neighbors and invite our friends into our new home. [Exhales sharply] Yeah. What? We're having a baby, Cody. Yeah. I mean... I know. His foot's pressing on my bladder right now. No, I just look... I just want to be a good father to him, C.J. That's all that matters to me. I want to be a success, you know? I want him to be be proud of me. As proud to be my son as I will to be his father. I know what you're thinking, but no one, not even Hap Briggs, makes it overnight. [Chuckles] So that's why I will always place my bet on you, because I know that your next great idea is right around the corner. Mm. [Chuckles] ♪ What? Babe, you're brilliant. Just right around the corner. Hey. I'll explain later. You're a genius. Okay. I'll be back.  Bye. ♪

♪ we're burning up like fire ♪ [Laughs] [Sighs] [Laughs] Wow. Ahh.  [Laughs] Now, that's what I call a nice breakfast. [Sighs] Yeah, well, you know what they say. Most important meal of the day. [Laughs] [Sighs] What? Nothing. It's just for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful. Like all my problems are going away. ♪ We're burning up like fire ♪

♪ Hey, Lace. Where's dad? He called, said it was important. Well, I think he's still up climbing Mount Carla. But, uh, he should be down soon. Okay. Not an image I needed this morning. Thanks.  [Chuckles] Hey... Let's go take a walk by the river. We haven't done that since we were kids. Sound good? Well, it sounds like my little sister is trying to protect me from something. And you don't have to. It's not like that anymore, Lace. I'm fine. Dad and I, we're in a great place right now. It's... honestly, I kind of know what it's like being you. Being me? The good child. [Laughs] The kid who lives up to her father's expectations all the time. Okay, seriously... Morning, son. Hey, Pop. Did Lacey give you the good news? No, not yet. Well, she's going to stay home and work for the old man. Welcome, Lacey Briggs, to Briggs Oil. [Chuckling] God knows we could use the help. [Sips] Come on, Lace. I got things I got to catch you up on. Lacey : Okay. I don't know why he had to tell you like that. I do. Taking jabs at me is his favorite hobby. [Ringing, beep] Billy : Hey, Clifton, it's me. I may have found a way to make our fortune while we wait for the right piece of land to drill, okay? Picks and shovels, baby. That's how people got rich during the gold rush. And you know what? You know what our picks and shovels are? Tanker trucks. We don't drill the oil... we move it. I got us, like, a crazy cheap deal on four of 'em, man. I'm coming over right now. You better be ready for me. [Breathing heavily] [Knock on door] [Clears throat] Hey. Is your grandfather here? Hey, where'd he go? Billy...  Clifton! Hey, Clifton!  Billy. I'm telling you, I had the best idea ever. We're gonna make us a fortune. We're gonna lease tanker trucks. Billy.  Where is your granddad? Billy!  What? My grandfather had a heart attack. He's in intensive care. If either one of you starts crying, I'm gonna have Nurse Ratchet out there kick you the hell out of here. [Chuckles] Clifton, what... What'd the doctor say? Aside from advising me not to eat the cream of chicken, I'm gonna be fine. Hey. That's great news, isn't it? That was a pretty good plan there, Billy. What was? [Chuckles] The tanker trucks. I heard that message. That was a hell of a notion. That was a good idea, wasn't it? So, do you want to buy the tankers? Oh, Billy, I-I want to. You don't know how much. But, uh... Starting a new business is a young man's game. Besides, you know that Hap Briggs would be three steps ahead of us all the way. Yeah. Probably would, wouldn't he? Billy, you don't need me. All you need to beat Hap Briggs is leverage. Tried that once. [Chuckles] Yeah, you made the same mistake I made 30 years ago. You thought Hap was your friend. Yeah, well, Hap doesn't have any friends, does he? No. He uses people to get information. And he uses that information to get what he wants. To beat Hap Briggs, you've got to be Hap Briggs. ♪ Pull! Dammit! Pull! Wow, you're really off today, Hap. Something on your mind? That missing money from Jules' birthday party ever show up? I know what you're thinking, but there is no proof of that. I don't need proof. That kid finds trouble. He always has. It got me to thinking again. Could Wick have been one of the gunmen that damn near got me killed out there at the rig? You need to make peace with your son, Hap, one way or the other. I don't have the answer. Then I need to find someone that does. Pull! Hey, Tip. Don't tell me this is Savannah. [Door closes] College graduation last May. Oh, man. I remember when you were sworn in, she was just a little bitty thing. Long time ago. [Sighs] Some of us aren't so fortunate to have our kids turn out to be what we hoped for. Can I help you with something right now, Hap? I want to ask you a tough question. All right. I-I just... I just want the truth. Do you have any reason to believe that Wick was part of that robbery out at Nirvana? Now, Hap, I can't discuss an active investigation... Tip, was my son out there that night? Father-to-father. Officially, I don't have the evidence to charge Wick with a crime. Father-to-father, your son knows a hell of a lot more about what happened out there than he's telling. That's father-to-father. ♪ Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ♪ Cody : Your menu sounds great for our housewarming party. Now we just have to talk about price. There's no discussion. This party's a gift from the three of us. No charge. And no arguments. [Laughs] Thank you. ♪ You fall through the trees ♪ 
♪ and you pray with your knees on the ground ♪ Uh, hey, where's Kess? I feel like I haven't seen him around much lately. He's been busy with the truck... Running around, lining up vendors. You know.  [Cellphone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I'm about to be late. I'm gonna go meet Jules. Would you do me a favor and just lock up when you're finished? Thank you. Bye, Finn! ♪ And we all still die ♪ 
♪ what will you leave behind? ♪  [Door opens] ♪ Oh, we all still die ♪  [Door closes] ♪ So, I was thinking we can cook the food on the truck and warm it in the kitchen. Or we can talk about how I can't stop thinking about you. [Both chuckle] You can lie to your friend. But we both know that Kess hasn't been around lately. I have. For you. I'm sorry. I can't do this. I'll be on the truck. Toward you. Yep. [Machinery whirring] Lacey : Dad asked me to run a P&L, see how we're tracking versus budget. We hitting our timeline? We're on schedule. Okay. You good? Wick? Yeah, I'm great. couldn't be better. [Machinery grinding, indistinct shouting] What's going on? Man : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stop! You know what to do! Sounds like the drill bit. Hold that line!  Get me the pipe tallies. [Scoffs] We got to call the geologist.  No, I've got this. I don't want to have to run this string back into the ground, okay, guys? Let's move it.  Hey! What's the problem here? We hit a chert carbonate formation. Now I got to trip the entire string and put on a tri-cone bit. In English, pal. Turns out drilling this well is a lot more complicated than I was led to believe. Okay, well, you'll handle it, right? As soon as you agree to compensate me and all my crew for all the extra work. [Chuckles] Okay, listen, slick. This little shakedown operation you got going might have worked for you in the trailer park you grew up in, but not on me, okay? We're not renegotiating anything. Thanks for letting me know. She's all yours. [Whistles] Pack it up, boys. Let's go. Hey, what the hell are you doing? You still don't understand? I'll put it in English. I quit. Hey, don't you walk away from me! Looks like your brother sure knows how to make friends, right?  Hey, I'm talking to you! Says the guy who lies for a living. Look, all I know is somebody better fix this before your father finds out. Hey! Are you listening?! You walk out on Briggs Oil and you're burning a very long bridge, my friend. Hey, we're not done here! Damn it! [Engine turns over]  [Sighs] ♪ Yo, buddy. Miss me? What the hell are you doing here? You were supposed to get lost and stay lost. That's where I was headed, till the accident. Now I need a doc for my wing and some cash. I'm thinking 20k should cover it. 20k? [Chuckles] Are you insane? I don't have that kind of money. Well, that's the number that works for me and guarantees that I stay quiet. Or what? You're gonna tell my father? Tell the cops? Go ahead. Talk. You're the one with a murder on your hands! [Grunts] I'll tell them that it was your idea! You told me to pull the trigger. That makes you as guilty as me. Okay. Okay. I-I...I can... I can probably get a couple thousand together by tomorrow night, okay? So in the meantime, why don't you just... Just get a motel room, and I'll text you when I get the rest of the cash, okay? I'll see you tomorrow night. Do you think I bought enough? [Chuckles] Yeah, if you're having octuplets. [Laughs mockingly] Oh, look, it's your future mother-in-law. Hi, Carla.  Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? You look beautiful, as usual. Glowing.  Thank you. Hap and I took the jet up to Big Sur. There was an amazing spa. You ladies would love it. Big Sur. Sounds a bit above my pay grade. [Both chuckle]  Well, then have Wick take you. Yeah. The Briggs men act tough, but five minutes at the spa and even Hap was purring. That's quite an image. [Cellphone chimes] Is everything okay?  Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, just my bar manager. Delivery mix-up. Probably should take care of that. Ladies. Bye. Sounds like he can't live without you. So he says. ♪ You leave me breathless ♪ Well, isn't that lovely? A gift from your weekend trip with your wife. [Scoffs] Just open it, will you? [Laughs] A sea flower. Your favorite.  Mm-hmm. It made me think of you. Yeah, what did Carla get? 10 dozen crystal roses? Oh, come on. I didn't come here to fight. Or for anything else, for that matter. I want to talk. You know, I do business with everybody... Kings and presidents. When it comes to having someone to talk to [sighs] Not so many. Yeah, well, we always were pretty good at talking. Amongst other things. All right. [Chuckles] So, what's going on, Hap? I have reason to suspect that Wick was part of the theft out at Nirvana. What? You think Wick was one of the siphoners? And may have been the guy that had the gun stuck in my face and almost got me burned to death. You know, I keep waiting for him to... to grow up. And I think I may just have to accept the fact that Wick is gonna be one of those guys that just always makes the wrong choice. [Scoffs] You're serious. I wouldn't joke about something like this. You are actually stooping this low. What? You suddenly have suspicions about Wick right after I give you back your necklace. You're just trying to drive the two of us apart. Jules, no...  That's why you're sitting there, making up stories about your son... so you can get me back. I just wanted to talk. This is not about me. Oh, who are you kidding, Hap? It is always about you. Just leave, will you? Please? ♪ [Door opens, closes] 
 
 [Indistinct conversations] ♪ So, now you're retracting your alibi from the night of the robbery? Gary said that if I didn't cover for him that he was gonna tell my father I was the one that gave him the rig codes, which I did not. And you're telling me all this now because... I'm tired of lying to you. I'm tired of Gary's threats. I'm tired of the blackmailing. I just... I want it all to end. Okay. So what if I tell you that I'm really not interested at all in putting Gary away for stealing that oil? I want him for Spinks' murder. Well, then I'd tell you that he admitted it to me. Told me he killed Spinks, blamed him for the siphoning. You willing to testify to that? Absolutely. Yeah, there's only one problem, Wick. Your friend Gary has disappeared. Well... I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow night. Apparently he's busted up and needs some money. I was thinking there might be a solution that... Works for the both of us. ♪ [Knock on door] I told you to leave! I'm not gonna keep doing this with... Hi! Hey. Cody. Sorry. I thought you were my m-manager. Just got into a bit of a tussle earlier, so it's... Good, because, um, I need your opinion on these dresses for the party. Should I return these? Because this one's okay, but this one's, you know... It's, like, sort of parachute-y, and... You know what? Actually, don't answer that. I'll show you. Sure. Why not? I could do with the, uh, distraction. Yeah, your bar manager sounds like a real handful. He has his charms. Sometimes he can be a little bit too persistent. Some days I could just do without the drama. Just have a normal life with a husband and a... And a kid. Like you, you know? W-when... was the last time you took a vacation? Never. I haven't left Rock Springs in years. You know, I don't actually know what I was thinking. This isn't... it's not parachute-y at all, so... Thanks for the fashion advice. Um... I actually... I have to go meet Millie, so... I'll see you later at the party. ♪ Wick. Thanks for coming in. I appreciate it. [Door opens] [Laughs] [Sighing] Geez. Think he's telling the truth? Doesn't matter. When Gary finds out that Wick rolled on him, he'll turn right around and roll back our way. So first I'll catch a killer, and then I'll catch a Briggs. Billy? In here. What are you doing? [Sighs] I'm just trying to find a market that Hap hasn't cornered yet. You know, he's, like, got every single... What are you doing? [Sighs] Ow. Mm. Ooh. Thank you.  For what? For being a fiercely loyal, dedicated... And loving husband. Where is this coming from? [Sighs] [Chuckles] I'm just thankful for who you are and what we have. That's all. You are really pregnant, aren't you? Mm! Yeah. I am. And, um... [Sighs] Maybe it's the pregnancy brain talking, but... Do you think it's possible that Jules and Hap are having an affair? What? No. [Laughs] Okay, it adds up. She told me she once was in love with an older man, a man she couldn't resist,  and she was not herself at her birthday party. And last week, I saw him coming out of the back door of the Tack Room. Really?  Mm-hmm. And then I saw in her apartment some gift from Big Sur. Hap and Carla went to Big Sur last weekend. Yeah, I know. [Sighs] She's my friend, and now I know this horrible secret. Well... It's not about the secret. It's what you do with it. [Indistinct talking] ♪ Word is that production was down for several hours. You want to tell me what the hell happened? Well, we had a problem with the drill, daddy. All right. Explain to me why we lost our best driller for half a day. Dad, let me explain, please. Show some modesty, would you? Wick fixed the problem. He put a performance bonus on the table to smooth things over so the driller and his crew agreed to work a third shift to make up for the lost time in exchange for a 5% bump. It was 5%... Right?  Yeah, 5%. I mean, we're lucky it was only a couple of hours. It could have been days if it wasn't for Wick, dad. Nice work, Wick. All right, carry on, kids. You didn't have to do that. Do what? Solve the problem, cover for me, like you always do. Wick, you're my brother, all right? I know it's not how this business or our family normally works, but what is so wrong with us just looking out for each other? Everyone sees me for what I am. You see me for what I could be. ♪ All right, let's get it back up! Yes, I put the cash in to cover the check. ♪ Make way, make way ♪  It should clear now. ♪ You've never seen the likes of me ♪  Okay. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. ♪ Hey, babe, what you say? ♪  [Cellphone beeps] Hey, man. Everything okay? ♪ You're gonna make time for me ♪ A check bounced, but the bank cleared it all up. It's... It's nothing. You sure? 'Cause, uh... Doesn't seem like nothing. ♪ You're no longer in control ♪ You're not around. Moving money between bank accounts... Cash drops disappearing. I don't know what you're talking about. Hey. Don't worry, all right? I haven't said anything to Ada. So, what is it? Craps? Poker? Ponies? ♪ Blackjack. At the Indian casino up the road. How much? Everything Ada and I have earned since we opened. [Whistles] [Sighs] You know... I owed 100 grand back in Chicago. Sports books. Lost everything. Even my girl.  What did you do? I found a little magic, but, uh... It's not for everybody. Please. If you know a way to save my business and my marriage, I'll do anything. Then you are in luck, my man. 'Cause this truck... Is good for selling a whole lot more than just chicken. ♪ Hey, Billy. I was surprised to get your call. Yeah, well, I know what a fan you are of surprises. Well, I'm eager to hear what was so urgent. Have a seat. [Sighs] Okay, then. You know, I thought that we were gonna be friends, Hap. I really did. Well, I'm sorry I disappointed you, Billy. Maybe one day you'll thank me for... giving you your first lesson in the oil business. I'm not here to thank you, sir. But I would like to show you what a good student I am, which is why I came here to talk to you, you know? About family. Family. Yeah, your son, for instance. Or... Sorry... your son's girlfriend. You know, the one you've been screwing. What do you want, Billy? I want my 5% of McCutching play back. Or we add Carla to this conversation. [Laughs] Asking for 5% of McCutching is like asking for 5% of the world's gold reserves. And besides, that would make us partners again, and I was under the impression that you're not that fond of me. Oh, I never said anything about partners. I want cash, seven-figure advance. And when McCutching's online, I want the royalties put into a trust for my kids and their kids after them. See, I told you that this was all about family. Okay, then. [Dialing] Carla : Yes? Carla, sweetheart, can you come in here for a minute, please? Sure.  What are you doing? Well, if you have something to tell my wife, you should tell her. Mm. Hi, honey.  Hi. Um, Billy drove all the way out here to see you. Billy, what is it? Everything okay with Cody? Hap. Hap. [Sighs] Yeah, everything's fine, Mrs. Briggs. I made a mistake. You have a good evening. What was that all about? [Laughs] Nothing. Just a student flunking his final exam. Don't give it another thought, my love. ♪ So... [sighs] This is hard for me to say. [Chuckles lightly] Um... I don't have a lot of friends up here, so the ones I do have are really important to me, and I want you to know that. Okay. [Both chuckle] Is everything all right, Cody? I know that you're having an affair with Hap. [Laughing] What? I haven't told anyone, and I'm not going to. Look, I'm not sure where you got that idea from, but... you're wrong. I saw that box from Big Sur. Right. [Chuckles] Jules. Hey, I... I'm not here to judge you. I just don't think that you should be in this secret alone. [Sighs] Obviously, I never meant for things to get this complicated, but, you know... I ended it. At least, I think I did. [Chuckles] The problem is, Hap Briggs isn't exactly an easy person to say no to, so... And honestly, I'm not even really sure that I was ready to say it. [Sighs] He's Hap Briggs. I get it. [Chuckles] [Cellphone vibrating] [Sighs] Speak of the devil. [Cellphone beeps] Now is not a good time. Uh-huh. [Cellphone beeps] Cody, when you said you didn't tell anyone, did that include Billy? I tell you something in confidence, and you use it to, what, blackmail Hap Briggs?! No! I didn't. I just wanted to beat him, okay, one time, that's it. Oh, oh, okay, so that's a justification, then, for betraying me and my friend? No, I'm... I'm not trying to justify it, okay? Hap would have done exactly the same thing. Only I didn't do it because I'm not that kind of person. But you tried.  [Sighs] Can't you see that that's just as bad? No, here, take this. This is yours. Put it away. I tried to do the right thing, Cody. You know what? 'Cause out here, the rules are different. Whose rules? Hap's rules?  Yes. I am trying to make a life for us here. I am trying to put down roots, and you are alienating anybody who tries to get close! No, that is not what I'm trying to do, okay? That is not true. The one friend I cared about. You know, she's not coming tonight, and she probably will never set foot in this house again, and I can't say that I blame her. Cody, I'm sorry. Okay? I have to go to the pharmacy. I said I'd take an extra shift. W-why are you going... Because one of us has to work. What about the party? I'll be back before it starts. [Scoffs] [Door slams] [Mid-tempo piano music playing] [Music stops] [Laughs] Do you remember that weekend I went away and came back and the patio window was broken? And you said it was your fault, because you had been practicing your Baton and it flew out of your hand and broke the window? Yeah, I remember. You know I knew it was Wick all along, right, and his piss-drunk friends. [Sighs] I didn't bust him, because I was so moved by you protecting your big brother. Dad... He's a grown man, Lacey. You cannot keep covering for him. He's trying. All he wants is to make you proud. [Sighs] What changed when I was gone? A lot. And this time... Just twirling the baton can't fix it. [Sighs] I wanted Wick to succeed here. Then let me help him. I got to tell you something, Lacey. Hmm? The McCutching play is much bigger than anyone knows. If done right, it's gonna make the Texas oil fields look like a can of Quaker state. [Chuckles] Our competition is gonna catch on soon, and when they do, it's gonna get ugly, fast. I need my best and my brightest around me. Wick is not one of them. [Sighs] Okay, testing. Hello? Can you guys hear me? Okay, good. [Exhales sharply] You think the guy will show? He'll show. Soon as we get him on tape admitting to the murder, we will move in, all right? Okay, he's coming. [Breathing heavily] You got the cash and the pills? Yeah. Hey, hop in. I want to talk to you for a second. No way. I'm not getting in your car. [Panting] Okay, fine. No, no, don't get out. Don't get out. Don't get out! Just give me the stuff and I'll be on my way. All right, listen to me. We got to figure out a way to keep you safe. Good, he's still in range. All right? I'm worried about the murder investigation. What about it? [Feedback] What was that? You're not alone, are you? You're setting me up! Gary, that's not... That's not what's going on here, all right? Calm down.  You're a dead man! Listen to me.  You hear me? Dead! Now.
