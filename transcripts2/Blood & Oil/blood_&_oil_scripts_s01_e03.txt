 Previously on "Blood & Oil"...  
 All we got to do is ditch this tanker and we walk away clean. 
 There's already a cash reward for you fellas. 
 You boys are probably worth more than the oil. 
 Slugs in him will match the slug I found out at your rig. 
 Ms. Briggs? 
 How's my dad? Is he gonna be all right? 
 [Chuckles] Oh, he'll be all right. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 I'm gonna let you in. 
 A share of this deal's gonna cost you 500k. 
 What do you mean, you bought it? 
 I committed to something with Hap today, okay? 
 Why can't we do both? 
 Because there's not enough money to do both. 
 I don't think I'm gonna be able to go in with you after all. 
 I got to take care of some things on the home front first. 
 Wick : This is Jules Jackman... my girlfriend. 
 Hap Briggs. Twice in two days... 
 This is starting to become a habit again. 
 We shouldn't automatically discount anyone. 
 No son of mine would put a gun in my face. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Jules : Another nightmare? 
 Yeah, well, that's what you get for trying to kill your own father. 
 Coward. 
 [Gasps] [Birds chirping] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Another nightmare? 
 [Sighs] 
 No, it was quite the opposite, actually. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Oh, yeah? 
 What was it then? 
 Well, I could tell you... or I could just show you. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Carla : You okay, Hap? 
 Hap : I can't stop thinking about that night and Wick. 
 You were wrong. No way. 
 No way would he have done something like that... 
 Steal from me and put a gun in my face. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry I ever suspected him. 
 I got to bring him back into the fold and remind him of what it means to be my son. 
 [Cellphone buzzes] 
 Goldman's coming in with the numbers for the McCutching deal. 
 I'll set a meeting for tonight. 
 I think I'll ask Lacey to join us. 
 She may as well sit in while she's home, learn a little about the business, how it works in the real world. 
 The more Briggs, the better.

 Bang, bang. Yeah, it's dangerous being an oil siphoner in the Bakken. 
 I'll count on you to solve this one, sheriff.

 I need to put it on my frosted flakes. 
 Billy? 
 Billy : Hmm? 
 Hungry, pregnant woman... Help. 
 [Chuckles] Sorry. 
 I just can't stop thinking about that environmental deal with Hap. 
 Just feels like we missed the boat on that one, you know? 
 No. 
 No, you didn't. 
 You took care of your family, you bought us this house, and you invested in your friends, and I'm really excited to go into the restaurant business with Kess and Ada. 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] Look, I just want to be able to give you everything you deserve, whether it's this house or hot sauce for your cereal. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I know. 
 And inside deals with Hap Briggs is a way I can make that happen. 
 Good, you're here. 
 Get that can and paint the other side. 
 I want this tanker out of here asap. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We can't move anything right now. 
 I got a buyer lined up on the reservation. 
 I want this oil gone, and I want my money. 
 Garry, listen to me. There is way too much heat. 
 Do you understand? 
 You think I don't know this?! 
 I should've never listened to you. 
 Genius idea getting back at your old man by stealing his oil. 
 Hey, hey. 
 You're the one who upped it from grand theft to murder! 
 Spinks was gonna turn us in! 
 And you didn't even think about offering him a piece of the profits, huh? 
 Make him a partner instead of killing the guy?! 
 Listen to me. 
 Listen to me. 
 We're gonna sell this oil, okay? 
 I promise you, but we have got to let things cool down. 
 We got to be smart because the guy who's looking for us, I assure you, he is. 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] Yeah. 
 Billy : Hard to believe, isn't it? 
 Two weeks ago, I was gonna open up a laundromat. 
 I can tell you, it's a hell of a lot more fun making profits in the millions than it is in quarters. 
 Yeah, well, I, uh... 
 Still thinking about the one I left out there on the table... 
 Rock Springs response. 
 Well, that one didn't work out quite like I thought it would. 
 Wait, you lost money? 
 Oh, no. No, no, no. 
 [Chuckles] 
 No, but I only tripled my profit on it. 
 Wait, what do you mean? 
 You sold it already? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I flipped it to Schlumberger this morning. 
 That's the funny thing about a boom.

 Hap : I remember standing on a parcel of land just like this one, looking out over all of our rigs. 
 You must've asked me a thousand times, "Daddy, how do you get that oil out of the ground?" 
 [Chuckles] I was so damn busy back then, I... I never answered you. 
 So, what'd you want to show me? 
 Right there. 
 Koala 1? 
 You were born premature. 
 Koala was the Incubator they had you in. 
 And I, uh... 
 I bought this parcel of land the day you came home. 
 It was always meant to be your first well. 
 Why didn't you ever tell me that? 
 We haven't been talking that much lately, have we? 
 This is the one we do together, son.

 That all right? 
 Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 Ha-ha! Hey! Whoo! 
 Now it's a party. 
 I'm so excited for you guys!

 Tell me. 
 Do you want your G650 in glossy or matte?

 So, Lacey, are you excited for your first meeting at Briggs Oil? 
 Yes, it's a dream come true, pop... 
 A Friday evening looking over earnings reports with old men in suits. 
 Yes! [Laughter] 
 Maybe you should skip it then, spend some time with your friends while you're in town. 
 I would, but I think my father's grooming his kids to take over the business, so one meeting can't hurt. 
 Right, Carla?

 Uh, this is Jules. 
 I got to take this. 
 Lacey : Oh, make sure you tell her the good news.

 I'm Finn Wyler. 
 And I told you there were no jobs, Finn Wyler.

 And the answer's still the same. 
 I don't need a chef. 
 What can I help you with, love? 
 Realistic question... 
 Why don't I cook you a meal? 
 You're gonna love it, I promise. 
 You don't even have a résumé! 
 I ran a food truck in Chicago, and I swear to you, they were lined up around the block. 
 All right, great. Tell you what. 
 I'll give you a call when someone quits or needs a ride.

 Hap : How's your education coming? 
 Billy : [Chuckles] Oh, you know... 
 I'm learning how to join pipe for the drilling rig. 
 Of course, that's not quite the education I had in mind.

 Heard you and Wick have a new play in the works. 
 Koala, I think it's called. 
 Listen, if you're looking to sell any equity, I'd be interested. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You don't give up easy, do you, son? 
 Well, would you? 
 [Chuckles] Well... 
 There's always more money to spend on a drilling rig. 
 That's for sure. 
 Hell, I spend half my time raising financing. 
 How are those Geo reports looking? 
 Productive. 
 Well, maybe I could help you cover some of the final costs, if you're open to it, sir.

 Wick?! 
 Take Billy over to Koala 1 and show him around! 
 The new rig? Why? 
 He's thinking about coming on board as an investor.

 This is so much further along than my other play. 
 It's already pumping fluid. 
 I mean, how much longer till this thing's online? 
 This isn't a guided tour, okay? 
 You got questions, ask the tool pusher. 
 You really don't want me in on this, do you? 
 You're  not  in on this. 
 All right, this is a father/son project. 
 Look, man, I'm not trying to come between you and your dad. 
 I'm here as a potential investor. 
 That's all. 
 I'm not your enemy. 
 You know what else you're not? 
 My partner. 
 What? [Scoffs] 
 Hey [Chuckles] wait, buddy, look, I'm trying to be cool, man. 
 But let's be honest. 
 I wouldn't be here if Hap didn't want me to. 
 I'm sorry. What are you saying? 
 I'm saying that maybe your problem isn't with me. 
 It's with your dad. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What is this... A little frontier therapy? 
 Look, my father and I, we've had our differences, okay, for sure, but that's behind us now, and the last thing I need is you poking your head around, reminding him of all the things that I'm not. 
 Well, you don't need my help in that department, do you? 
 I think you remind him of what you're not all by yourself.

 We're bringing it  online  together. 
 Capitalizing it is my department. 
 You said this was my birthright. 
 Shouldn't I have a say on who's gonna be involved, or at the very least... 
 No! Hell no! 
 You told me you wanted a second chance to prove that you could be responsible, that I could trust you!

 No word to me, no apology or "we should talk." 
 I can see you're still hurt. 
 Yeah, and I can see you're still perceptive. 
 I'm sorry.

 Yeah, I met that guy once.

 I mean, this is... This is actually happening. 
 It's like out of a movie. 
 [Sighs] And it's ours. 
 Wow. 
 Woman : I know, right? 
 Let's go say hi to your partners. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Hi! Hi. 
 Very exciting, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 This must be your first oil strike. 
 Sure beats the hell out of a rig fire, though, doesn't it? 
 [Chuckles] Hap: Sure does. 
 Are you two ready for the first day of your new life? 
 We'll see. [Chuckles] 
 Wick : Hey, man, I'm sorry about the other day. 
 Sometimes I... Speak before I think... hit, too. 
 It's a bad habit. 
 Hey, listen, my bad habits are a hell of a lot worse. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, you want to go see the control room, see where all the magic happens? 
 Sure. 
 Uh, yeah, actually, if you'll excuse us, too, I want to go show Billy our new food truck. 
 He's not the only smart investor in the family. Oh. 
 We know. You're the one who negotiated us up 5% on the McCutching deal. 
 [Both laugh] 
 I bet they think they have the golden touch. 
 It sure seems that way, doesn't it? 
 All : [Chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! 
 Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! 
 Ahh! $400 a bottle? 
 Hell, I'm worth it. [Chuckles] 
 Today, you're all worth it! 
 Give me a case of Cristal, sweetness. 
 Tip : You win the lottery, LaFramboise? 
 It's not a crime to put some money back in the local economy, sheriff. 
 No, it's definitely not a crime. 
 Why don't you take a look at these photographs right here? 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 And I want you to tell me if you think  that  is a crime. 
 'Cause I think it is. 
 Cody : I can't believe this! 
 Seriously?! That's amazing! 
 I think it's closer to 150 meals. 
 In an hour! 
 We're out of red chilies. I'll get some from the van. 
 Hey, babe, come on. 
 Hap says we're almost there. Let's go. Okay. 
 I'll be back, partner. 
 I need another special! 
 One special... all day. 
 Hey, uh... 
 You got something. 
 Thank you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Ada's married...  Happily  married. 
 I know that. 
 Do you? 
 Because you flirt... A lot. 
 [Sighs] I don't want you messing things up around here for any of us, so... 
 Keep it professional, got it? 
 Got it. 
 Strictly professional, darlin'.

 Man : 20 feet! 
 It's really happening? 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Kind of like watching your dreams come to life, isn't it? 
 It never gets old. 
 Man : 10 feet! 
 Hey, come on. 
 2 feet! 
 This is it! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Aah! 
 [Cheers and applause continue] 
 [Laughs] 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 [Laughs] 
 Aren't you glad I decided to invest in this? 
 Oh, you did? 
 Yeah, right. 
 Isn't it supposed to keep going? 
 [Sighing] Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 It is. 
 Hap? 
 Why'd it stop? 
 What happened? 
 Billy : What the hell happened? 
 Why'd it... why'd it stop? 
 It was a spike hit. 
 A-a spike? A... what's that? 
 It's a little pool of oil under pressure. 
 A little bit pokes through, and it makes a little spout. 
 That's it. 
 That... what do you mean that's it? 
 That's... There's no more oil? 
 Not today. 
 Go ahead and cap it, Tommy. Yes, sir. 
 Hey, hey, hey, w-w-what about our investment? 
 Oh, well, yeah, that's a... That's a tough break. 
 But we'll use the money and continue to drill and... 
 Push deeper. 
 Maybe in a few years, this well might produce something yet. 
 Ah, damn it. 
 You knew this well was a dud, didn't you? 
 All that B.S. about Wick and the investors... 
 You played me. 
 You  asked  me  to get in on this deal, remember? 
 Yeah, because... 
 You promised me it was gonna be a hit. 
 Not every well is a gusher. 
 Sometimes you drill a dry hole, but that's not on me. 
 That's reality. 
 When you met me, you told me you wanted to learn the oil business. 
 Well, guess what, son? 
 You just learned. 
 ♪ 
 [Sighing] 
 The samples I tested were negative. 
 I'm sorry. If you can't deliver on this, there are others who can, Ahmed. 
 No. 
 I'll give them what they want. 
 I have another way in. 
 You used me, pop! 
 You... Said that Koala 1 was our well... 
 The one that we drill together! 
 It was our well. [Scoffs] 
 Then about six weeks ago, I discovered that it might be dry. 
 I wasn't for certain until today. 
 Damn right I used you. 
 I needed to get McCutching back. 
 That's the prize. 
 [Sighs] A trillion dollars' worth of oil. 
 Billy had no business having that in his hands in the first place. 
 So, why didn't you just say that before? 
 [Sighs] 
 We've left a lot of blood on the floor, you and me. 
 I didn't always have time to teach you, and you damn sure didn't want to learn. 
 But you impressed me today... 
 With Billy. 
 You were the bigger man. 
 And I know you didn't want to do it, but you did it for me. 
 Well, now it really is time for me to teach you. 
 I want you as my partner on the McCutching play. 
 That's  the one we do together. 
 Pop, I want that. 
 I want that more than anything in the world. 
 You know that. 
 We're gonna achieve great things together. 
 [Chuckles] 
 One thing, Wick. 
 If you're gonna be in this with me... 
 I mean,  really  in this... 
 You got to stay focused. 
 Yeah, of course. You've got to eat, drink, and sleep oil. 
 When you go to bed at night, you got to dream about oil. 
 When you rise in the morning, you got to be thinking about oil. 
 You can't let anything... 
 Not a woman, not even a good woman... 
 Pull your eyes from the prize. 
 Wait a minute. What are you... 
 What are you saying? 
 You got to end it with Jules... now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 ♪ 
 Get some rest. 
 Big day tomorrow. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Wick : What? We got a problem. 
 I got popped for boosting the oil. 
 You got to get me out of here. 
 Well, w-where are you? 
 I'm in jail. 
 The sheriff thinks I had something to do with Spinks' murder. 
 Are you listening? 
 They're gonna want me to flip, and you know what'll happen if I do.

 [Crickets chirping] 
 Billy : [Sighs] 
 I can't believe I was so... 
 So stupid. 
 I lost all of it. 
 We have a house and a food truck. 
 Kess and Ada make some damn good chicken. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] 
 It's you and me, Billy. 
 That's what... That's what counts. 
 [Sighs] You and the baby... 
 Our family... 
 Will never want for anything. 
 [Sighs] 
 I did not see this coming today. 
 But you know what? 
 When the time comes, neither will Hap Briggs.
