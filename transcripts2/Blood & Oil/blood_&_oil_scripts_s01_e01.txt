 Natural gas. 
 Just comes up with the oil. 
 They're just burning it off. 
 Why don't they collect it? 
 They're making so money up here they don't bother picking up loose change. 
 (Horn honks) 
 Billy! 
 Billy : Cody and I would just like to say thank you for the big send off, and for investing your hard-earned money in us. 
 We're opening three laundromats in North Dakota, 'cause that place is booming. 
 We're not gonna let you down. I promise. 
 We won't. 
 That's right. 
 We're gonna return 10 times your money. 
 (All cheer) 
 Wanda : I want you to have it. 
 Cody : But this was Memaw's. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She went to Orlando in the '20s during the land rush. 
 You take care of yourself. 
 I'm scared. 
 I want to thank the pretty girl over in the corner... 
 (Chuckles) 
 My wife, Cody. 
 She is my high-school sweetheart, my wing-woman, and my best friend. 
 So, thank you for joining me on this grand adventure of a lifetime. 
 Cheers! 
 (All cheers'ing and cheering) 
 (Indistinct conversation) 
 Well, for better or for worse, Billy. 
 For better or for worse.

 Cody! Cody! Cody! 
 Are you okay? 
 Hey, talk to me. 
 Nice driving, Dale Jr. 
 Oh, thank god. 
 Woman : Due to the overwhelming call volume, it may take Rock Springs Police Department 24 hours to respond. 
 Thank you for your patience. (Sighs) We'll call home in the morning and tell them we hit a rough patch. (Scoffs) And say what? "Sorry you invested $37k in big entrepreneurial plan, but we screwed the pooch before we ever got up there"? (Sighs) I don't think so, Cody. Well, we had these machines insured, right? Because I remember, we could've either insured all the equipment or you could've purchased three more washers. And I distinctly remember we decided to insure them. (Sighs) I need help, babe. What? To pick up our insurance. Billy! ♪

What? You got no place to crash. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, we were actually just planning on, uh... On, uh, camping in our truck, but, um... But we totaled the truck, so... All right. Well, your best shot is probably the Patchwork Hotel out by the train station. Great. You're gonna love it. Five-star. Yeah? Hey, anybody want to see cowboys versus indians better get outside! Oh, my god. You're such an idiot! I just don't care, lady. Oh, my god. No. Ain't no one cares what you got to say. Pipe down, lady. I don't want to hear it. Man : Go home, lady. Go home. You know what? Do it. You have no idea what you've done. (Laughs) Yeah! We are taking this animal. Get away... get away from the moose. No. We're taking... Step back away from... No. No! Lady! No! Move along, lady. Step away from the moose! You're making a huge mistake! Come on, now. Garry! Garry! 300 yards, one shot. I was laying out. He just posted up. Pow! I had to show my hunting buddy first. You shouldn't have taken a white moose, Wick. What are you talking about? This is a state record, I'm telling you. Look at it. You're gonna have to leave the state to keep from getting your head kicked in. Oh, you... You see this? Whoever kills a spirit animal is cursed. Really? Yes! That's right. Well, then the spirit animal shouldn't have been on Briggs land. Calm down. Get your hands off my trophy, lady. Hey, hey, hey. No! Untie it. You want to get shot, lady? Wick, come on, buddy.

Me? You. What are the charges, tip? Drunk and disorderly. (Scoffs) Disturbing the peace. And being a constant pain in my ass. (Indistinct conversations) So, this is the Patchwork Hotel. I guess so. This is like a campground. Come on. Seriously, next time you got to promise me we're gonna make reservation before we get here. Oh, cheer up, kid. Yeah. This ain't bad. This is bad. Stop. Don't move.

Our children. Yeah. Yeah. The real question is what'd you do to this barbecue? Yes! It's unbelievable, Kess. Come on, man. That is my secret red-pepper sauce. Ahh. Ooh. It's got that kick. Yes.

(Bottles clink) See? It's not so bad. Cody : Just when I'd lost all faith in humanity, you meet someone special. You okay? Yeah. Kess is taking me to where they parcel out rig jobs in the morning. You're just gonna jump in, start roughnecking? Yeah, well, those washing machines aren't gonna replace themselves. (Sirens wail) (Scoffs) Surprised my old man didn't bail me out himself. Mr. Briggs was too upset to come. Yeah, I bet. ♪ (Dog whines) You're better now. Come on. Let's go. (Horse neighs) You are aware of how much land the Mandans control around here, right? Just how excited do you think they're gonna be seeing a Briggs Oil truck come rolling over the hill after what you did last night? I guess I'm not current on my native American superstition, pops. Sorry. Hey, you've taken trophies all over the world. I figured you'd be proud of me. The next time I'm proud of you, Wick, it'll be the first. I wasn't proud when you quit college. I sure as hell ain't proud that you're running around all over town scamming deals that are never gonna play out, trashing the family name. You think I'm just gonna toss you the keys to the kingdom and watch you drive it over the cliff? I'm taking a different tack with you. You're going to work on a rig. Duchess, here. So, the bitch got to you, huh? Keep talking about my wife. Uh-huh. You start pushing mud first thing. (Spits) (Indistinct conversations) Come on! Sorry, boys. All the roustabout gigs are gone, all right? (Men groan) Aw, hey, man. Listen, listen. I need a job that pays cash today. Please. All right. You can push mud. It pays 100 bucks per. Whoa. A lot of guys can't last half-day doing that. Yeah, well, how hard can it be, right? (Laughter) Come back tomorrow, you tell us. Jules : I retrofitted each unit with a kitchenette, so it's really more like an apartment. Don't you work at the Tack Room Bar? I own it. Around here, you've either got two jobs or two houses. Yeah, well, right now we don't have either. (Sighs) I promise you, with the demand up here, this place won't last the week. Somebody stole the frame on that one. Sleeps just fine. How much is it? $2,000 a month. Firm. I'm feeling sick. That's what everyone says when they hear the prices up here. (Airplane engine whirs) (Dogs barking) Hap : Ben, you want to grab them? Go on. Well. I missed you. (Chuckles) Mm. I missed you, baby. You remember that, uh, weaselly V.P. From Goldman? Isn't that every V.P. At Goldman? You mean Singer. He mentioned a bombshell coming out of U.S. Geological. Since when do New York bankers have patch intel we don't? Since they got new thermal mapping technology. Singer acted like I already knew about it, so I stove-piped him and he kept going. We got to get that report, Hap. Before it comes out. Well, I'm betting you already invited our old buddy the oil commissioner to our party, now didn't you? He's seated right between us. I knew there was a reason I married you. (Thunder crashes) Come on, man. Keep it moving. Right there! Hold that thing down. Get it going. Get it going! Slow down, son. They're not paying you by the shovelful. Last time I saw you, you were in a bit of a situation, huh? Yeah, I wasn't worried. What were the Mandan Indians gonna do, huh? Nothing. Your last name's Briggs, yeah? Too bad you're not Hap's son. Yeah, that's too bad. The baron of the Bakken's your old man? (Indistinct shouting) I've read all the stories. Dirt farmer's son. Wildcatter. Man's a legend. Yeah, only if you don't know him. What are you doing out here with the fish? What'd the b*st*rd say? Oh, yeah. "Learn the business from the muck up." What the hell does he know, anyway? I could blast through this shale faster than any tool pusher he's got. Waste of my damn time. (Indistinct shouting) Irv : Mrs. Carlson, I'm gonna do your refill, but you got to follow these tags. You cannot drink alcohol with this. It's gonna be as long as it's gonna be. My eczema's killing me. I am sorry. Doc, come on, put a rush on it. Okay, I'm not a doctor, and everything in here's on a rush, all right? Oh, come on, man. Why you got to be such a jerk? Uh, 'Scuse me, sir? What? Corticosteroid cream mixed with coconut oil will knock back eczema. What? All right. Coconut oil. Cortico's in five, coconut oil's in the grocery store. Thank you, young lady. Sure. No problem. (Truck beeping) Man : There's got to be something in there! Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Whoa! Stop! The wire! Stop! What are you whining about man? [Bleep] You're gonna knock the whole thing down! (Wires warbling) Whoa! Watch out! (Men yelling) ♪ Bloody hell! You could've killed us! What are you doing?! You were on the rocks! It's not on me! He was backing me in! I am not his spotter! You are fired! Go to the office and turn in your credentials. Hey, cost me a job, slick. Pushing mud? Please. I just did you a favor. Wick Briggs. I saw you back that truck in. Wha... (Laughs nervously) You weren't paying attention, boy. That's a million-dollar mistake. I had nothing to do with it. It wasn't my fault. (Grunts) You're a lying son of a bitch. Get up, man. Stop acting like a damn coward. (Men shouting) (Grunts) You are out, boy. No cards, no clubs, no cash. Are you hearing me? You're out! (Scoffs) You don't deserve to be my son. (Thunder rumbling) Hi. Wow. You look good. Is this... Is this ours? Yeah. Yeah, 1,000 bucks. Here. What are you doing? Robbing banks over here? Yes, I am. No. I got offered a job at the pharmacy in town today. Mr. Youngerman advanced me my first paycheck, so... But you dropped out of pharmacy school after two years. Yeah, well, apparently that's good enough up here. Mm. Said he'd take every waking hour I could give him. (Laughs) It's a foot in the door. Yeah, you like it? Christmas lights and everything. Mm-hmm. Oh, that a girl. Look at Cody LeFever marching down the field, throwing first downs. Yeah, that's me. (Chuckles) Well, um, I had a little setback today. What's that? I got fired. You got fired. Hey, yeah... How? It's your first d... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen. Listen to me. It's okay. It was just a job pushing mud. It's still a paycheck. This place is hopping. I'll find another one. I'll find something. Promise? (Sighs) Babe. I'm sorry. I haven't felt this bad in a while. Must've caught a bug or something. Hey, you look at me. (Sighs) I'll do anything to take care of you, you know that. Promise. A lot of promises. I know. But this one I really mean. You know, those other ones... (Laughs) (Soft music plays) Time to flush some Mormon pheasant, don't you think? Give me the gun. (Chuckles) You don't need one, honey. Commissioner, Hap and I are so glad you could join us. Thank you. Happy birthday to you, Hap. Well, thanks, Myron. So happy you could be here. Thank you. I'll be with you two in just a minute, all right? I hear Salt Lake's putting a squeeze on you to get a temple built in Rock Springs. Oh, I'm, uh... I'm squeeze-proof, Carla. (Chuckles) Of course you are. But I guess you've heard the rumor that our dear governor's been hiking the Appalachian Trail. I have. And when that rumor goes public, there's gonna be a recall. Then I shall, uh, pray for spiritual guidance. (Chuckles) You don't need spiritual guidance, Myron. You've got me. A smart oil and gas commissioner with the right backers could be sleeping in the governor's mansion. And that temple, well, the governor gets to approve whatever he wants. (Sighs) You're a little crooked. Hap, this is unbelievable. According to Myron's report, the richest areas of the Bakken shale are on land previously thought barren. That's the four bears Indian reservation. Those plots been drilled harder than a Tulsa whore. The old Wells didn't go deep enough. The Bakken reserves are at least 10 times previous estimates. Bigger than the Saudi Ghawar field. Come on. Yes. Hey, now! (Laughs) Well... Except... Tribe is gonna be pissed because Wick shot that damn moose. Doesn't matter what they say. This property will give us access to the oil. You're good. Cody : May I help you, sir? Prescription pick up. Richard Ford. Okay. Sir, are you in our system? As is my phone number. What time do you get off, darlin'? I'll get your prescription. (Cellphone rings) Ford here. Yes, sir. Driving out to McCutching Ranch right now. Yes, Mr. Briggs. Buying the property is my top priority. I will close it asap. Crash job. Thank you, Mr. Briggs. (Cellphone beeps) Here's your hemorrhoid cream, sir. Apply twice a day. Next. 
 
 ♪ You usually only come around my place when you want something. (Sighs) You gonna kick me out, too? You know me. I'm a giver. Hap cut me off. Oh, baby. That'll blow over. You two fight all the time. Well, it's different this time, apparently. Cut you off like how? (Scoffs) Cut me off. I'm out of the house. I'm out of the will. I'm cut off. So what if Hap cut you off? There's opportunity everywhere up here. I started this place with nothing but a keg of beer and $2,000 in cash. Hap doesn't think I can do it on my own. But he's not the only one that can make money. Who cares what Hap thinks? I'm here for you, Wick, no matter what. You know that, right? (Scoffs) Well, I'm glad he did it. You take his money and he owns you. Well, fine, then, you son of a bitch. I'll make my own way. So, what's your play? To get mine. To get mine. ♪ (Sighs) Oh, boy. (Sighs) You get on the wrong side of Briggs Oil, nobody will touch you. Well, you know what you need? Besides help with that boot? Wife who loves me? Oh, I was gonna say a steady job. (Scoffs) Oh, what was that? A steady job? Yeah, a steady job. What is that supposed to mean? Well, you know what, I overheard this land man in line today at the pharmacy. He was talking to Hap Briggs on his... on his cell. Are you listening to me? I'm listening. He was telling him to pay top dollar for this McCutching Ranch or something. It sounded like some real big secret. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Was in line today? Mm-hmm. Said it had to be done today. Crash job. Are you listening? McCutching Ranch. McCutching Ranch, huh? Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm listening. I'm just trying to get a job. I hear you're hiring. Hm. Well, you know, we have a very intense vetting process. Oh, is that so? So I don't know if you're gonna make the cut. Oh, really? Mm. Well, we'll see about that. - Mm-hmm. Oh... How's the job interview coming? (Sighs) You're hired. Billy : So, if I understand this correctly, the only way in or out of the McCutching Ranch is through this parcel here? That's right. That plot is currently owned by... A Mr. Clifton P. Lundegren. Clifton P. Lundegren. Clifton P. Lundegren. Got it. Hey, thanks. ♪ I never knew them mineral holders held the right of way. Even on a person's front porch. Which one of them oil thieves you working for? (Laughs) Well, I did a spell on the rig. But, you know, I'm branching out on my own now. (Laughs) You're pissing up a rope if you think you're gonna be wildcatting around here. Well, listen, I'm just looking to develop this land. For a car wash. (Laughs) (Laughs) Car wash! I'm serious. I haven't seen a clean car or truck since we got here, you know? Hell, I've been here 70 years. I-i ain't seen one yet. Do realize we're 10 miles out of town, don't you? Yeah, well, hey, Rock Springs is booming. I mean, this here could be a retail strip in a few years. You know that, right? Tell you what I'm gonna do for you, young buck. I'm gonna sell you that option. But it's gonna cost you a pretty penny. $70k. (Sighs) That's too rich for my blood, sir. $75k. Every time you try to counter, the price is gonna go up. Just keep talking. Well, let me see what I can do. Buffalo : $100,000 and it's yours today. I can put $10,000 down. We might could make that work. Let me guess. You're doing it for the frequent-flier miles. Something like that. You sure there isn't anything wrong? It just seems so cheap. I know. But it's a liquidity crisis. I got to let her go for $75,000 cash today. Baby. Hi. Hey. I mean, did I tell you our luck was gonna change or did I tell you it was gonna change? Look at this. Whoa. (Laughing) I mean, we got a line on a bottleneck plate that Hap Briggs is gonna have to pay up the nose for. (Laughs) I mean, I already locked up a $75,000 deal with the guy that owns the parcel. Oh, you made dinner. It looks great. I have... yes. I-i have news. That cash is gonna look like pocket change when we lock up that parcel. I mean, I had to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, but, look, when it all works out, it's gonna be golden. You... you borrowed $75,000? Yeah. I had to. No, no, no. I know... I know it sounds crazy, but look, baby. I mean, a miracle just fell into our lap. It's a sign, C.J. I mean, this is it. This is the reason we came down here. Billy... I mean, you roll the dice in a town like this. And it is just boom! You know? I'm pregnant. You're what? I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Oh, baby. Come here. That's wonderful, sweetheart. Pretty boy land man from Briggs Oil dropped by here. He offered me $150,000 for the option on that easement. Wait, what? So... We had... we had to go all-in to get your money. You can't back out on us right now. What... (laughs) I'm not backing out. See, those Briggs people, they're the ones that screwed me last time. I can't give you that discount for nothing. Tell you what. You bring me $100,000 and cut me in for 25% of whatever business you're gonna put in out here in east nowhere... Sir... which I know damn well is not a car wash. We cannot do $100,000. We can't. We... we definitely can't. Well, suit yourself. Briggs people will be out here tomorrow at noon. You get here before 'em... We got ourselves a deal. We gave it our shot and it didn't pan out. And there's no shame in that. But we are living in a parking lot... It's okay. With our unborn baby. It's not okay, Billy. It's not okay. Listen, i-i know that this was our dream, but... But, you know what, this... it... This changes things, you know? This is... This is a sign. This is... This is a real sign. A sign for what, Cody? Wh-wh-what are we gonna do, go home? Tail tucked between our legs? Why not? Because we've lost all of our friends' and families' money! I mean, we are buried in debt. I can't do it. I'm not gonna do it. I mean, you... You promised me a year, and it's been a week, Cody. Well, the baby changes that. It doesn't have to. (Scoffs) Don't quit on me. I'm no... Don't quit on me. Please. Your time's up. Your family's leaving in the morning. Cody. Hey, Garry. Rumor has it a Halliburton semi got jacked south of 85 last week. I hadn't heard that. Whose gear's this? Just a little deal I run on the side. Strictly to the trade. How much would a jacked truck net? Hypothetically speaking? Depends on the equipment. Used rigs and rods, $25k per. Hypothetically. (Scoffs) That's chump change, man. You're playing pickpocket when you got a jewelry store right across the road. What are you talking about? Siphoning. That's a whole other deal. Rig keys, codes, inside access. (Keys jingle) One tanker of Dakota's sweet crude's worth about 20 of your little stagecoach jobs. I'll get us in. You get it sold.

Cody : (Chuckles) Look, I'm prepared to offer you a three-year lease for $1 million, sir. (Chuckles) Non-starter, son. We don't even know if there's oil down there yet. Well, you bet big on the McCutching land, and that's right next door. Why'd you do that? Yeah, without our access parcel, your McCutching land is pretty much worthless. So, it's, uh, the price of the ticket. Billy, that's an ambitious play you're attempting. But you got a little problem. We're just gonna wait you out. We can drill on that land next month, next year. Do you have that kind of time, Cody, with a new baby on the way? It's just a wild guess. I noticed you weren't drinking. Have you two picked out a name yet? We were leaning towards Hap Jr., as a matter of fact. (Laughs) That's good. You know, I've come to learn that these leaseholders have 60 days to commence drilling or the mineral rights get transferred to the next highest bidder. Turns out that's a law. Seems like we're both short on time. (Chuckles, spits) We'd also like a working interest going forward. A piece of the... A piece of the... A piece of the pie... Pie. I think it's called, right?
