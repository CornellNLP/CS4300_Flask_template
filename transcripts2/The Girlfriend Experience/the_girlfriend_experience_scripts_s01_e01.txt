 (DOOR OPENING) 
 Hi! 
 Hey... 
 Come in. 
 Woah... Did you come in that? 
 What? 
 I mean did you, like wear that...? 
 Oh, no, I wore it with a jacket. 
 So where's the guy? 
 He's at a meeting, but he left his credit card on the room. 
 Do you get room service? 
 What's your most expensive bottle of champagne? 
 $700? 
 More expensive... 
 What's your most expensive bottle of wine? 
 $900? 
 Can we get both? 
 Great. 
 Yeah, can I also get an order of the roasted chicken? 
 And then can I get the calamari? 
 (WHISPERING) You want anything? 
 (WHISPERING) French fries. 
 And a side of French fries. 
 For two. 
 Okay, great! 
 Thank you. 
 (SOUND OF PHONE HANGING UP) 
 They have a spa? 
 Yeaaah! 
 Christine Reade... 
 Hi! 
 Hi! 
 (WHISPERING) "Enhancement of battery-operated machines..." 
 "Enhancement of battery-operated machines by graphene nanosheets" 
 "Graphene nanosheets, graphene nanosheets, graphene nanosheets ..." 
 I'm particularly intrigued by your firm's involvement with the graphene nanosheet patents... 
 "Styrene-butadiene..." 
 Can I just see this? 
 "Styrene..." 
 "Styren-butadiene." What is it? 
 It doesn't matter, they just want to hear their own words repeated back to them. 
 I'm definitely interested in your firm's involvement with the Styrenbutadiene rubber. 
 ♪ (THEME MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 Where did you go to undergrad? 
 What's the most useful piece of advice you've ever received? 
 Hi, Christine Reade. 
 Keep breathing. 
 (SOUND OF TURNING PAGES) 
 We will also be examining a range of contracts related to intellectual property, including confidentiality agreements, also known as non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs... 
 And non-compete clauses. 
 Christine Reade, I'm here for my interview. 
 This is a year-long, competitive internship. 
 Only two out of the ten interns will be offered a position at the end. 
 How will you handle this environment? 
 I welcome the competition. 
 I recognize that both teamwork and competition are necessary components for problem-solving. 
 Why Kirkland? 
 Because you're focused. 
 I'm particularly interested in the litigation work you're doing with catheter-based cardiac procedures. 
 I feel that your client base is at the forefront of medical technology. 
 Anything else? 
 I'm sure we'll be speaking to you soon, Christine. 
 (SOUND OF ELEVATOR OPENING) 
 She's particularly interested in that aspect of what we do... 
 She wasn't bad though. 
 ♪ (BAR MUSIC AND PEOPLE CHATTING) 
 Any follow-ups? 
 One. 
 What about you? 
 No, not yet. 
 It's still early. 
 I just don't want to end up at some pro bono shop. 
 It's not like I want to be a lawyer anyway. 
 You make them money...

 Tell me what you like about this. 
 You can stay the night. 
 I have to get up early. 
 That was fun though. 
 I like you. 
 What? 
 I said, "I like you." 
 Thanks. 
 See ya... 
 (SOUND OF DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) 
 (SOUNDS OF BUSY OFFICE) 
 Hi, I'm Christine Reade. 
 Christine, right? 
 Yes. 
 Take a seat. 
 Do you have any I-9's? I'm all out. 
 Thanks. 
 Here... I need you to sign this NDA. 
 It basically it says you agree not to discuss any cases outside of Kirkland. 
 And we are going to be assigning you to... 
 David Tellis. 
 His executive assistant is Susan King. 
 He's in Office 324. 
 Got it. 
 That's the break room, through there. 
 You've got supplies... 
 That's important, paper, cups, I don't know, stuff. 
 Here we've got Tariq's office. 
 Tariq, it's Christine. 
 Welcome. 
 And that's Carson, he's the big guy. 
 Yeah. 
 Over here, we have Erin's office, and Erin is... not here. 
 Executive assistants... 
 Interns... 
 We've got the IT room in there, and further on down here, we've got the coffee room, and the ladies... 
 You do know he's a partner, right? 
 Yep, joined 2000, made partner in 2006, B.A. in biology and computer science, Yale Law '94, Cal Tech, '90... 
 Oh good, good, you know how to google. 
 Um, now that's David there, we're just going to wait here. 
 File a complaint. 
 That's Erin. 
 They're growing impatient. 
 What time does he get to work? 
 Ahhh, 7:00. 
 Tell them we're doing it in the most cost-effective way. 
 You tell them, I'm not your f*cking assistant. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Hey. 
 Have you got a moment? 
 Not really. 
 (DOOR SLAMMING) 
 Right then um, let's get you started on some cease and desist letters, shall we? 
 That way. 
 (SOUNDS OF TYPING ON KEYBOARD) 
 Chicago-Burnham Law School, right? 
 Yes. 
 Carrie, right? 
 Christine. 
 Did you write this? 
 Yes. 
 Did someone tell you to write it this way? 
 That's a yes or no question. 
 No, I-I thought the language... 
 It's a cut and paste job. 
 Don't get clever. 
 You cut and paste. 
 I was just trying to make the language more exhaustive, and not leave room for doubt that not only is the client's patent new and novel but in this particular... 
 Okay, just stop, stop, stop. 
 Follow me. 
 Sit down. 
 (DOOR SLAMMING) 
 Do you know what this is? 
 A hip replacement. 
 Right. 
 Do we give two sh1ts about replacing your grandpa's hip? 
 No. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We don't give a sh1t about your grandpa. 
 This is what we give a sh1t about. 
 The silicon. 
 The coating. The material. 
 The "proprietary process" if you want to use a law school term. 
 The sh1t that makes this thing new and novel. 
 So make the language nonspecific to the medical field? 
 No one reads cease and desist letters. 
 Here's 50 of them. 
 I haven't read them. 
 They get filed and I'll never see them again. 
 "Cease. Desist." 
 The words mean sh1t. 
 It's a required paper trail. 
 Understood. 
 Good. 
 So cut and paste the letters. 
 Control-C. Control-V. Control-C. Control-V. 
 Cut, paste... 
 I pray you know what I am referring to. 
 I know how to cut and paste. 
 David. 
 I know. 
 Un-huh... 
 We have paying clients. 
 This is not law school, Carrie. 
 Christine. 
 I know. 
 I was making a joke. 
 Funny. 
 (SOUNDS OF STUDENTS ENTERING CLASSROOM) 
 Patent litigation is the most expensive and time-consuming of all the types of lawsuits to initiate and/or defend. 
 Now, one of the grounds for invalidating a patent is lack of enablement. 
 A patent application must disclose sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. 
 He wants to buy me a new car. 
 What should I tell him? 
 I'll take a new car. 
 Here, take my picture. 
 I'm gonna act surprised. 
 (SOUND OF GIGGLING) 
 Is it awful? Lemme see. 
 He'll love it, I dunno... it's got the backpack, on campus, the whole college-girl thing. 
 What's his name? 
 Garrett. 
 How old is he? 
 He's 55, but he looks good for his age. 
 (SOUND OF TYPING ON SMART PHONE) 
 My... friend... took this... 
 She is... my hot study partner. 
 Is Christine as beautiful as you? 
 Yes, she's even hotter and much smarter. 
 I'm not sure that's possible. 
 You should meet her. Are you...? 
 Are you pawning me off? 
 No! OMG, you are mine! 
 Whoa! Whoa! That was just getting good. 
 No, you're gonna think it's creepy. 
 Why? 
 You're just... 
 I'm just what? 
 
 
 
 ♪ (SOFT BAR MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Show me. 
 Okay. 
 Seeing you in your real life, as a student, made me hard. 
 I'm glad. 
 I was thinking about you when I took that. 
 In what way? 
 How wet I got when you pulled my panties to the side... 
 Hey! 
 Greg! 
 It's Craig. 
 It's okay, I don't really remember your name either. 
 Avery, this is... 
 Craig. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 So how are you? 
 I'm good. 
 Good. 
 Ummm... 
 Avery's had a really hard day, so we're just in the middle of a serious conversation. 
 Oh, sure... 
 I'll call you. 
 Yeah, good. Great. 
 You f*cked him, didn't you? 
 How wet I got when you pulled my... 
 (SOUNDS OF WILD GIGGLING) 
 Oh look... 
 Tell him you miss his tiny pen1s. 
 Okay... 
 (MORE GIGGLING) 
 Wait, this-this is it, coming up. 
 Yeah, right here, thank you. 
 This is it? 
 I don't have any cash. 
 Yeah, it's so far away from everything, I know. 
 I feel so bad for you. 
 (TAXI DOOR CLOSING) 
 Oh, good. 
 The cleaning lady came, so I don't have to be embarrassed. 
 (SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ECHOING IN HALLWAY) 
 (SOUND OF UNCORKING WINE BOTTLE) 
 So you just live here now? 
 Yeah, he likes the idea of me being here while he's away. 
 I get a free place to live. 
 Symbiotic. 
 So you guys are living together? 
 He's only gonna be here twice a month, so not really. 
 I can't afford to be doing that right now. 
 Yes, you can. 
 We're young and... 
 That's all I got, but young is enough to drink to. 
 (SOUND OF CLINKING GLASSES, GARAGE DOOR OPENING) 
 So I think that's the one he wants to give me. 
 And then... 
 These are never driven because I guess the salt messes up the paint job in the winter time. 
 But I guess in the summer, he takes them on road trips.

 Sorry, wait, this is him, I'll be right back.

 Yeah, we went out and had a few drinks. 
 Where are you? 
 I miss you. 
 I can't wait to see you. 
 I wish I could kiss you right now. 
 I love you, too.

 The one-the one at Kirkland. 
 No... 
 Yes, one of the interviews, the one I got at Kirkland.

 Okay, um, I-I'll call you on Saturday and I'll explain everything.

 Yes. 
 Yeah, if you last that last-call kind of look. 
 Am I gonna be seeing more of Stacy? 
 I hope so.

 Are you one of those kind of girls that needs to talk to her man every five seconds? 
 I guess I haven't really met anyone that I want to talk to every five seconds. 
 That makes me sad. 
 How do you guys know each other? 
 We used to date in high school. 
 Oh, well, how- uh, how did it end?
