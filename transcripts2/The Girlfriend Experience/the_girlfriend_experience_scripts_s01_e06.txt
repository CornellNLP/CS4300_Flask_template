 (PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Want to get a beer? 
 Right now? 
 Yeah. 
 It's not going to trial, I got it. 
 Checks go to Quorta. 
 Still the same. You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly. David didn't say. He must have said something. He must have given a reason why. No, he didn't. He doesn't have to. He just said he wants a new intern. Just let it go. Michael amended his will two months ago. I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family. $500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne. Are you Chelsea Rayne? (SOUND OF CHRISTINE BEING PULLED UNDERWATER) Don't ever do that again! (BACKGROUND SOUNDS OF BUSY RESTAURANT) Chelsea... Hi. Hi. I thought that was you. Small world. How have you been? Good. It's great seeing you. You look beautiful as always. Jack... Alex. Alex... Jack. Alex. Pleasure to meet you. You guys just had lunch? You should try the sea scallops, they're amazing. I had them last time. And the escargot? Incredible. Anyway, I don't mean to intrude. I just wanted to say hi. It's good seeing you. You, too. Take care. Alex. We have a problem. I spoke with Peter Gramercy, off the record. Cilic's kids are now aware that you've been left half-a-million dollars of their father's money, and they're going to fight it. I could have predicted that. We should assume they're gonna do their best to expose you as an escort, which could also open you up to criminal charges. Do you know what the estate's worth? Did Gramercy tell you? Again, off the record, Twenty-two million. And they're willing to drag their father's name through all of this, for a fortieth of the estate? Could be a bluff, but we should err on the side of caution. (SOUND OF JACK UNBUTTONING CHRISTINE'S BLOUSE) (DEEP, EROTIC BREATHING) (SOUND OF JACK MOANING) (MORE EROTIC BREATHING) What was the name of the man you were with the other day? Adam? No, it's Alex. Oh, Alex. That's right. That's right. Do you often see... older men? I mean I assume he's... a client of yours, right? Given his age. Am I right? Can I ask you something? Will you tell me the truth? Sure. What's your real name? It's Annabel. Where you from? D.C. Arlington. Do you like being an escort? I met you. There are four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a two-car garage. The master bedroom is on the upper level. The floor to ceiling, wall-to-wall glass provides stunning views of the lake. Look around. Take your time. (SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRWAY) So what do you think? Would you live here? Are you kidding? In a heartbeat. You would? Are you asking me to move in? I don't know. Maybe? I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. But not bad, though, right? No, it's beautiful. Some close friends of mine, Steve, and his wife, Ana, are throwing a dinner party this Thursday. You'd really like them. Sometimes Steve and I do business together and Ana owns The Cermark, that really cool art gallery in the West Loop. So it's a double date? If you want to think of it that way. I told them that we've been seeing each other. So, will you come? Yeah? Yeah. I mean I have to check my schedule, but I'm sure it's fine. Great. You make me really happy. You know that? You, too. To both of you. ♪ (SOUND OF JAZZ RECORDING) I'm really happy we finally get to meet you. Jack's been talking about you for weeks. Really? I haven't seen Jack this happy in a while. He doesn't deserve you. Guilty as charged. You don't deserve me. New couple! I'm embarrassed. I don't know what to say. Don't be. He's the one who should be embarrassed, hiding you away for so long. (SOUND OF ELEVATOR DESCENDING) Do you want to come back to my place? I'd love for you to see it. Okay. Come in. (FRONT DOOR CLOSING) Make yourself at home. Can I get you a drink? I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. (SOUND OF POURING DRINK) You're gonna go, now? It's one a.m. I wasn't expecting to stay the night. I have something to take care of in the morning. Like what? I had a wonderful time tonight. I feel very close to you. I feel very close to you, too. (SOUND OF KISSING) Will you call me tomorrow? Yes. Go to sleep. I need you to do a clearance search on these, asap. Make note of anything that seems even remotely questionable. I'm on it. (SOUND OF TYPING ON KEYBOARD) Hi, what's your name? Corey. Hi, Corey, I'm Christine. I'm having some trouble accessing some files on the main frame. May I have your last name? "Reade." With an "e" on the end. And which files are you trying to access? David Tellis'. XHP. I just accessed them yesterday. You don't have authorization anymore. Your access has been terminated. You'll need Tellis' approval. Okay. Thank you. No problem. 
 
 (SOUND OF TRAFFIC OUTSIDE BAR) Congratulations. Thank you. ♪ (LIVE JAZZ PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) (MUFFLED VOICES OF PARTY-GOERS) ♪ (JAZZ MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY) Don't take a picture. This is so cute. (SOUND OF JACK AND CHRISTINE LAUGHING) (CLICKING OF CAMERA) Stop touching me there! I'm sorry, I'm really ticklish. (MORE LAUGHTER) It's not funny. Oh, absolutely not. (CLICKING CAMERA) (SOUND OF FARAWAY TRAFFIC) My wife and I used to do this on sailing trips. You were married? I should have said "ex-wife". No, I just never heard you talk about her before. I didn't feel like I knew you before. Well, you do now. I will admit it. I do wish you were a little mad right now. You want me to trash talk your ex? I do actually. (JACK'S LAUGHTER) No. No, she's great. It was me. It's always about me. I'm sorry. Thank you. What's he offering? Can you get it higher? Eighty-five? Ho-hold on a second. (SOUND OF BANTER BETWEEN CHRISTINE AND MAN AT POOL) Okay. Where are you going? Back in the water. You wanna come? In a minute. I'll watch you. Your loss! (SOUND OF JACK PULLING CHRISTINE UNDER WATER) Don't ever do that again! You're getting out? I'm done. I was just playing around. I have something for you. What is it? Show me. Only if you answer one question. Go for it. What happened today? I have a thing about small spaces. Sorry. When you dunked me... No, with the guy. What guy? The guy that you were talking to at the pool. Did you know him? No. He asked me if I was alone, I said "no". Were you attracted to him? I was so out of it because you just... Just answer the question. I didn't have time to think about it. I'm so infatuated with you, I-I... I wasn't even paying attention. For now. Here. I bought the house. The one overlooking the lake. I don't know what to say. I bought it for us. So that we'd have a place of our own. So we didn't have to keep going to hotels. You can decorate it however you want. I thought you would like it. No one's ever done anything like this for me before. (SOUND OF CHRISTINE KISSING JACK) ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP AND ENDS ABRUPTLY) Can I see you Tuesday? Yeah, that should be fine. I'll just check and get back to you. Last night was incredible. It was amazing. I'll get back to you about Tuesday. (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR CLOSING) (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR OPENING) Forgot my phone. Did you leave it upstairs? I always do this. Sorry. Found it. You'd lose your head... ...if it wasn't screwed on. It's true. Bye. (SOUND OF ELEVATOR MOVING) Can I speak with Erin for a moment? Sure. Is it a good time? What is it? I hear you're heading the XHP case now. Yes. I'd love to be involved and help in any way I can. I was involved when David was heading it and I'd like to see it through. It's a bit of a mess right now, but I'll see what I can do. If they were smart, you'd be the new Managing Partner. Is everything okay between you and David? Yeah. It's fine. So, how's work? Fine. They're on a hiring freeze. Less positions, more profits. Who knows how long... Where do you intern again? A small law firm in midtown. Peters and Morgan. It's two guys. It's awful. (SOUNDS OF LOVE-MAKING) You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? It turns you on. Getting paid. Yes! Say it! It turns me on. (PASSIONATE BREATHING) (SOUND OF JACK'S EROTIC SIGHING) Take it in all the way. (SOUND OF JACK CLIMAXING) (SATISFIED GRUNT) (BUSY CITY SOUNDS) (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Hello? Hey, I miss you already. How did you get this number? You gave it to me. What's the problem? I didn't give you this number, Jack. (SOUND OF MOVING TAXI ENDS ABRUPTLY) Hey. Hey. Congrats on the promotion. Thank you. So my phone got stolen. And my sister got some weird texts. So if you got any weird messages... I haven't gotten anything. Okay. Well, great news for you. Yeah. Congratulations again. Excuse me. 936... 51... 85... 984... 53... 92... 10... 598... (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 236... I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to call you back. (CELL PHONE CONTINUES TO BUZZ) Christine? Hey, I didn't hear from you yesterday and I got worried... (SOUND OF HANGING UP CELL PHONE) (CELL PHONE STARTS BUZZING AGAIN) (CELL PHONE CONTINUES TO BUZZ) (CELL PHONE CONTINUES TO BUZZ) (CELL PHONE BUZZES AGAIN) I do not want you in my f*cking life, Jack. Do you understand? NEVER CALL ME AGAIN!
