 [theme music comes up] 
 I bought this place for late nights at the office, since Megan and I are having problems. 
 [erotic breathing] 
 You feel so good. 
 [passionate kissing] 
 I can't. 
 I can't stop thinking about you with other women. 
 Take it in all the way. 
 Who sent you that? 
 You sent it. 
 That's your f*cking email! 
 I didn't send that. 
 It didn't just go to me, too. It went to everybody. 
 Miss Reade sent over a video recording of you having s*x with her in your apartment. 
 You're through. 
 f*ck! 
 f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! 
 f*ck! 
 Somebody sent the tape to Chicago Lister. 
 They just ran a story, you like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 Say it! 
 [cooking] 
 Should I open a bottle? 
 Yes, please. 
 Get out of there! 
 I'm starving. 
 Well, it'll be done soon, you can hold off till then. 
 Out! 
 Alright, Dad. 
 Hurt my leg. 
 It's good to be back. 
 How are they doing? 
 Why don't you ask them? 
 Maybe I'll take them to a game this weekend. 
 Did Holgrem get back to you about Strauss & Hauer? 
 He did not. 
 Still waiting for the initial offer. 
 I'm really happy. 
 You don't have to keep saying that. 
 But I am. 
 It's true. 
 Then just show us. 
 [opening refrigerator] 
 [closing refrigerator] 
 [pouring drink, re-corking bottle] 
 [opening laptop] 
 [closing door to study] 
 [pushing play button on keyboard] 
 Take it in all the way. 
 [sound of man sighing erotically] 
 You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 Say it! 
 It turns me on! 
 [man grunting during s*x] 
 [pushing play button on keyboard] 
 [man sighing erotically] 
 Take it in all the way. 
 You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 [man panting during intercourse] 
 Say it! 
 It turns me on! 
 [sounds of busy airport] 
 The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking. 
 Hey! 
 Here, let me get this for you. 
 Thanks for picking me up. 
 Yup. 
 [car engine on highway] 
 If you have something to say, just say it. 
 We haven't heard from you since you sent that email. 
 Why aren't you returning our calls? 
 Well, what do you want me to say? 
 Are you serious? 
 What the f*ck is wrong with you? 
 You sent an email with a video attached... of you f*cking some dude to your family and colleagues. 
 You forced your mother and father to watch you get rammed by some... 
 [laughter] 
 It's not funny. 
 I didn't send that. 
 Then who did? 
 You can tell me. 
 Look, I know what you were doing. 
 I can't believe you're a pro... I can't even say it out loud. 
 Then don't say it out loud. 
 Did something happen to you? 
 Like when you were little? And you didn't say anything or...? 
 Because I-I honestly can not understand why you would do something so f*cking stupid. 
 Because I like it, okay? 
 [car door closing] 
 [dogs barking in neighborhood] 
 Do you want help with that? 
 No, that's fine. 
 Are they home? 
 Yeah, they're here somewhere. 
 Mom! 
 Dad! 
 [Christine's footsteps in hallway] 
 [back door slamming] 
 Yeah? 
 She's here. 
 They're out here! 
 Be nice. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, there! 
 Happy Anniversary. 
 Oh yeah, thanks. 
 So we were hoping you'd you'd come. 
 Why wouldn't I come? 
 Well, you know, we-we know you're busy, honey. 
 You've got lots on your plate. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Hey. 
 Happy Anniversary. 
 Thanks. 
 You're all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I made up the couch in the den... 
 I uh, didn't know you were coming, so we didn't get a chance to clean up your room. 
 I told you guys I was coming. 
 No, actually, Ahhh, I haven't heard from you in a few weeks. 
 Sorry, sweetie, your, your room, we kind of turned it into a bit of a dumping zone. 
 That's fine. 
 Okay, well, I need to get ready. 
 I'm gonna help Mom. 
 Do you guys need help with anything? 
 No, we're okay. 
 Yeah, we're good. 
 Your mom and Annabel picked up everything last night. 
 Grandma got in. 
 She's looking forward to seeing you. 
 Yeah, I haven't seen Grandma in so long. 
 Yeah. 
 Alright, I'm gonna go put my stuff downstairs. 
 Welcome back! 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 [back door shutting] 
 That wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. 
 I've been here ten minutes. Just wait. 
 No, she's gonna be caught up in the party. 
 It's not gonna be so bad. 
 I mean, you had to know that we would be upset. 
 I wasn't thinking about you guys when I was f*cking him. 
 What are you wearing to the party? 
 Probably something really sexy. 
 Okay... 
 Right, I'm sure Mom will love that. 
 You ready? One, two, three! 
 [party-goers cheer and applaud] 
 [general laughter] 
 So your mom was just telling us about what you've been up to in Chicago... 
 What did she say? 
 Oh, lots of things... 
 Uh, your school, your job... 
 She says you're doing great. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, no. 
 [baby wailing] 
 He's like, not again. 
 I haven't been to Chicago in years. Is it still as expensive? 
 Not really. 
 Ummm... Maybe compared to here. 
 That's what people tell me. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Gram, can I steal Christine for a second? 
 Take her away. 
 You're not talking to Gram about the video, are you? 
 'Cause Mom and Dad don't want her to know. 
 Of course, I'm not talking to Gram about the f*cking video! 
 I'm not an idiot, Annabel! 
 Okay, well this is all very unexpected for us. 
 Well, I'm glad you guys found a way to make it about you. 
 What are you gonna do about law school? 
 I don't know. 
 Are you going to finish? 
 I haven't decided. 
 
 
 
 [guests chatting, Annabel's footsteps] 
 I don't know how you guys do it... or did it for every day for thirty years. 
 Thank you. 
 I love you so much! 
 And I'm not gonna cry. I'm not. 
 To my mom and dad, everyone. 
 Cheers! 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Cheers sweetheart, cheers baby. 
 [laughter and applause] 
 I love you. 
 Do you want to say anything? 
 No. 
 [whispering] Just say something. 
 You guys made Annabel and I believe that we could be anything. 
 You made me feel like I could be whoever I wanted. 
 Our power got shut off when I was, I think, three. 
 Annabel was seven. 
 Ummm, and I don't know how, how you did that... 
 Had children, no money, and had to explain to them why? 
 But... they acted like it was planned. 
 And-and Dad told me that that's how the pioneers lived... 
 So... [laughter] we spent the rest of the night telling scary stories in the dark. 
 And you guys just made it seem like a big adventure. 
 And... 
 It still is. 
 And... 
 I never realized how hard that must have been for you. 
 Ummm... 
 Happy Anniversary! 
 [applause] 
 I am who I am because of you. 
 [dance music playing on sound system] 
 Do you want another drink? 
 Yes. 
 White? 
 Sure, yeah, if that's okay, thanks. 
 A red and a white, please. 
 [sound of music, party-goers chatting] 
 Thank you. 
 You're Christine? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Andrew Wyatt, I work at the high school with your mom. 
 Oh, cool. 
 What do you teach? 
 Math and physics. 
 Nice. 
 You're studying law at Chicago-Burnham? 
 Yeah. 
 Second year, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry, I uh, I know all about you. 
 Your mom talks about you all the time. 
 I'm sure she does. 
 You get home often? 
 "Home" as in "here"? 
 Yeah. 
 No, no. 
 I was gonna say next time you're in town, we should grab a drink. 
 Yeah. 
 [slow dance music comes up] 
 Hey! 
 Hey yourself. 
 Mom abandon you? 
 Yeah. 
 She's out front with the girls. 
 Oh. 
 Having a good time? 
 Yeah, it's pretty fun. 
 Yeah, it's a good party. 
 It's a rager. 
 Lots of old people. 
 I got news for you, honey: We're old. 
 Wanna dance? 
 Yeah... Yeah, sure. 
 ♪ Make it up every step of the way ♪ 
♪ It's not a movie or a book or a screenplay ♪ 
♪ Always trying just to keep my cool ♪ 
♪ Instead of taking it in ♪ 
♪ Like a first time fool ♪ 
 [slow dance music fades out] 
 Have a safe trip. 
 Take care. Thanks for coming, guys. 
 Great to see you. 
 Thanks for having us. 
 Alright, yeah. We'll be in touch. 
 Bye, guys. 
 No, she is doing great... 
 She loves her internship and they really love her. 
 She has one year left in law school? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a lot to manage, but you know, she's always been really good at juggling things. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 That's a good quality to have. 
 Yeah. 
 We're very proud. 
 You should be. 
 Mmm-hmm Christine, you would be proud of me. 
 It was really great to be here, congratulations. 
 So great. 
 Thank you. 
 Really beautiful evening. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 See you Monday. 
 You too. 
 'Night. 
 [footsteps in distance] 
 [sound of moving a glass] 
 [running water in sink] 
 Can't sleep? 
 I'm still wound up from the excitement. 
 Yeah, we all are. 
 [sound of faucet running] 
 [Christine drinking water] 
 I had a really good time tonight. 
 I really liked seeing you and Dad happy together. 
 Do you think that seeing you all over the internet like that makes me happy? 
 Do you? 
 Do you think that that's what I had in mind when your father and I decided to have you? 
 [soft moaning] 
 Here I thought you were so independent. 
 I was so proud of you. 
 You're on your own, all right. 
 [Christine packing] 
 You're leaving? 
 Yeah. 
 I have a job interview. Dad's gonna take me to the airport. 
 On a weekend? 
 Yep. 
 What kind of job are you interviewing for? 
 Just another internship. 
 Stop lying to me. 
 I don't want to be around Mom. 
 Like some breakfast? 
 No... 
 I'll get something at the airport. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, I'll uh, I'll take your bag to the car. 
 Okay. 
 I'm leaving. 
 Mom? 
 I'm leaving. 
 Okay. 
 Have a safe flight. 
 Thanks. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Be careful. 
 Okay. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Okay, I love you. 
 Love you. 
 [car door closing] 
 [sound of car starting up] 
 [sound of car on highway] 
 So that uh... was some video. 
 I didn't send that. 
 My ex-boyfriend sent it. 
 He was mad that I broke up with him. 
 Is that true? 
 Yes. 
 Want me to break his legs? 
 Yeah, if I don't f*cking break 'em first, piece of sh1t. 
 [trunk closing, airport noise] 
 Here you go. 
 Here, honey. 
 No, no, no, I don't... 
 No, take it, take it. 
 Just to cover... 
 Honestly, I really don't need it. 
 Changing your ticket and... 
 Get yourself a bite to eat before you get on the plane. 
 I'm sorry I ruined your anniversary. 
 Stop it, stop it, hon. 
 I'm glad you came. 
 Every-Everybody is. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too, sweetheart. 
 Safe flight, huh? 
 [theme music comes up] 
 [car door closing] 
 [door opening and closing] 
 I'm back! 
 Mar...? 
 Honey! 
 A little hair of the dog? 
 Something like that. 
 Where's Annabel? 
 Oh, she went to Vanessa's. 
 How's traffic? 
 Ahh, it's okay. 
 [birds singing] 
 You know, honey, that uh, that video... was shot by a jealous ex-boyfriend. 
 Boyfriend? 
 Yeah. 
 Ooohh... 
 Don't be naive. 
 She's always loved the attention. 
 She doesn't care how it affects us. 
 She's always been selfish. 
 It's the truth. 
 [dogs barking in distance] 
 [busy airport terminal] 
 [theme music comes up] 
 There you go. 
 Spread your legs. 
 Really slow. 
 Yeah, that's great. 
 So how did you find my reel? 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Online. 
 You have good reviews. 
 Alright, that's good. 
 Great, yeah. 
 You from Chicago? 
 Actually I grew up in Paris. 
 Nice. 
 Does this kind of work ever make you scared? 
 No.
