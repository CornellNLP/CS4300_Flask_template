 Previously on The Girlfriend Experience... 
 No, you're not getting the point. 
 No, I think I'm getting the point. 
 Look, if you don't want to come, that's fine. 
 No, I want to come. 
 I'm just... curious. 
 It's just drinks. 
 Also, he calls me Ashley. 
 Ashley? 
 It's my online profile. 
 You find guys online? 
 I find everything online. 
 I get it. 
 I don't need that. 
 It's just a gift. 
 I know what it is. 
 Should I be Chelsea? 
 You can be whoever you want to be. 
 (BACKGROUND NOISE, UNIVERSITY LOUNGE) 
 How's it going? 
 Hey. 
 It's been pretty non-stop. 
 Let me get this to you now. 
 You know, some of Stacy's friends are having a party over at Logan Square tonight. 
 You want to come? 
 Does Stacy want me to come? 
 Yeah, she's the one who asked me to invite you. 
 You should come. 
 You'd really like her. She's pretty incredible. 
 Did you tell her about us? 
 Not yet. But I'm sure she'll understand, it's in the past. 
 Don't be naive. 
 Cash it soon. 
 You're so cynical. 
 See ya. 
 I want you to amend claim 32. 
 Hold on. 
 You've got great organizational skills. 
 It's all up here. 
 I know where everything is. 
 I'm hearing some rumors... 
 Christine... 
 Ben Holgrem. 
 Learn this guy's face. 
 He's the devil. 
 My client is suing the sh1t out of his client. 
 I heard XHP is unhappy with you. 
 Tell Susan to hold my calls. 
 (SOUND OF OFFICE DOOR CLOSING) 
 He wants you to hold his calls. 
 (SOUND OF TAPPING KEYS ON COMPUTER) 
 I mean it's not something that I want to make into a career, but I actually enjoy it. 
 I like meeting new people, I like having s*x. 
 And I only do it a few times a month. 
 (SOUNDS OF WORKOUT MACHINES) 
 Do you meet all your clients online? 
 A few. 
 This woman, Jacqueline, vets them for me, and takes care of the bookings. 
 Why? Do you want to meet her? 
 I could introduce you, if you want. 
 No, just curious. 
 Okay. 
 But there's a difference between being curious and actually following through. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 If you meet Jacqueline, she's gonna wanna book for you. 
 You're smart and hot and funny. 
 You just have to want to do it. 
 I mean I get off on it. I like the rush... 
 All the attention, knowing he wants me. 
 Then there's the money. 
 And at the end of the day, if I don't get along with a client, I just move on. 
 All I really have to do is listen and ask questions. 
 And f*ck? 
 Yeah. 
 And f*ck. 
 (DRONING SOUND OF EXERCISE MACHINES) 
 (QUIET PURRING OF TAXI ENGINE) 
 (SOUND OF SHUFFLING MONEY) 
 Here's sixty. 
 Thanks. 
 (SOUND OF CAR DOOR CLOSING, TAXI PULLING AWAY) 
 (DOORBELL RINGING) 
 (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Hi. 
 Hi, come on in. 
 You're gonna have to play catch up. We're two deep. 
 Think I can handle that. 
 Look who's here? 
 Chelsea! 
 Hi. 
 Hey, glad you came. 
 Me, too. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 No, it's interesting because we have some sizable estates, and there's no better sport than watching the wealthy try to hang onto their money. 
 Or try to get some they think they deserve. 
 It just never gets old. 
 Really? 
 So it's not just the same story over and over again with different names? 
 Not yet. 
 And I've been doing this for 20 years. 
 Huh. 
 Do you have a lawyer? 
 Me? No. 
 Seriously? You should. 
 You can be my lawyer. 
 I would happily be your lawyer, but then... this would have to stop. 
 Why? 
 We're just starting to get to know each other. 
 (SOUND OF TAXI) 
 (TAXI SLOWING TO STOP) 
 Keep it. 
 Welcome. 
 Are you checking in? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you have any luggage? 
 No. 
 (SOUND OF ELEVATOR RISING) 
 (SOUND OF HOTEL DOOR OPENING) 
 Make yourself comfortable. 
 (SOUND OF ENVELOPE BEING PUT IN PURSE) 
 We're good? 
 Yeah. Great. 
 Drink? 
 Yes, vodka, please... um, with soda. 
 ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP SOFTLY) 
 Thanks. 
 (WHISPERS) Come here. 
 (HEAVY, PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 Do you like that? 
 Yes. 
 (MORE PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 (HUSHED SOUND OF HIGH-END RESTAURANT) 
 Yeah, listen, my 12 o'clock's here now, so I gotta run, but we'll talk about it later, okay? 
 Yeah... 
 We'll sort it out, I'm not worried. 
 Okay, bye-bye. 
 Jacqueline. 
 You are Christine. 
 I am. 
 You didn't tell me she was so beautiful! 
 She's great. 
 Federal Circuit has a monopoly on all patent appeals. 
 It was established by Ronald Reagan and is hardly met a patent it doesn't like. 
 If they make an error interpreting patent code, then every later judge is obliged to follow their ruling. 
 The whole system is a complete mess. 
 It's so great you know this stuff. 
 Stuff like law? 
 Yes. 
 I do realize it's the result of years of hard work and school, and that's your passion. 
 Well, it's costing me enough. 
 It'll pay off. 
 At least from this end. 
 Now I already have a couple of exceptional men in mind who I think would love you. 
 Do you have any photos? 
 Okay... 
 We'll get you some. 
 Don't worry, no one will ever see your eyes. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Where do you want me? 
 Just up against the curtain. 
 That's perfect. 
 (CAMERA CLICKING) 
 You look great. 
 Angle your chin up a little bit. 
 Beautiful. 
 Now just slowly start to unbutton your blouse. 
 (CAMERA CONTINUES CLICKING) 
 Perfect. 
 (MORE CAMERA CLICKING) 
 Beautiful. 
 Yeah, just chin up just a little bit. 
 Beautiful. 
 And turn to face the window. 
 Great. 
 Just lift the back of your skirt up a little bit. 
 Gorgeous. 
 Beautiful. 
 (MUFFLED SOUNDS OF STUDENT STUDY HALL) 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 It's whatever you're comfortable with, and how much you wanna get paid. 
 I want to make sure that you're matched properly. 
 For reasons I will let you figure out, most of your clients will be white and approaching middle age. 
 It should also be enjoyable for you. 
 I mean the more you enjoy it, the more they will too. 
 My big question is... 
 Why would I go with you when I can do this myself? 
 You mean why pay me? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it's just math really. 
 And quality of life. 
 The hours that you would spend finding and then vetting clients could be spent with clients, making money. 
 I'm the infrastructure. 
 You don't work for me, you work with me. 
 And if you're unhappy... you leave. 
 There's no contract. 
 I already have one client. 
 Hmmm... 
 At least I think I do. 
 Okay, well, he's all yours. 
 Can I tell you about Ryan? 
 He's assertive. 
 He knows exactly what he likes, but everyone who's seen him had a great time. 
 What are you comfortable with? 
 Did you and Avery talk about it? 
 A little. I mean I get the gist of it. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Bareback blow jobs? 
 Overnights? 
 Dinner at the Y? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm fine with all of that. 
 Great! 
 
 
 
 More wine? 
 (QUIET INTERIOR SOUNDS OF CLASSY RESTAURANT) 
 Chelsea? 
 Ryan... 
 You're late. 
 I'm always late. 
 She's older. 
 Of course she is. 
 So you have one sister. What does she do? 
 She's a math teacher. 
 What grade? 
 Middle school. 
 Any kids? 
 One. 
 A boy. He's 4. He's got a lisp. 
 A lisp? 
 That's cute. 
 What's his name? 
 Sean. 
 Bullshit. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Come on, you gotta rehearse this stuff. 
 Look, I know you're new, but Jacqueline should be runnin' bio drills with you or something. 
 Okay, she doesn't have a kid. 
 She could have 10 kids. 
 She could be a he. I don't care. 
 I think you should move closer, "Chelsea". 
 Okay, "Ryan". 
 How was your day? 
 (SOUND OF HOTEL DOOR OPENING) 
 (SOUND OF SPORTS ON TV) 
 Are you on the pill? 
 Yes... 
 But I'd like to use a condom. 
 Yeah, I don't have any. 
 I do. 
 Let's go to the bathroom. 
 (HEAVY, EROTIC BREATHING) 
 (SOUND OF PLASTIC WRAPPER) 
 (PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 Face me. 
 Perfect. 
 Just like that. 
 f*ck. 
 (SHORT, QUICK EROTIC BREATHING) 
 (SOUND OF MAN CLIMAXING) 
 Water is included. 
 Electric would be separate. 
 Take your time. 
 I think this place is great for you. 
 It's too expensive. 
 I can't afford this. 
 What if I cover the deposit? 
 And if you keep working, it'll figure itself out. 
 Emery, this is part of the process. 
 I'm not trying to manipulate you! 
 I'm sure that when you come down... 
 Hey, we're doing everything we f*cking can! 
 Hello? 
 sh1t! 
 We already gave you a chance. 
 This is how things move. 
 Don't f*cking lecture me on how things move! 
 Three mistrials. 
 Three f*cking mistrials, David. 
 Explain to me why I need to hear anything else out of your mouth other than you f*cked up. 
 This is not the time to switch counsel. 
 You will lose if Kersner sees you have doubts. 
 Do you get that? 
 I think what David is trying to say... 
 I don't need to hear the same goddamn words in a different tone. 
 I completely understand where you are coming from, Emery. 
 We, or maybe I should just speak for myself, I just want to know how to fix this. 
 How do you see this moving forward? 
 He didn't say. I don't know. 
 Maybe his wife's coming to town or maybe he's just not that into me anymore. 
 Either way, I have to pack up my sh1t and leave. 
 It's really not that big a deal. 
 Just stay with me until you figure it out. 
 Maybe Jacqueline can lend you money. She charges enough. 
 How much are you paying her? 
 Same as you... 
 30%. 
 Kind of steep, no? 
 Yeah, but it's pretty standard. 
 Why, you don't like her? 
 No, she's great, I just... 
 30%'s a lot. 
 That's all. 
 You can tell me if you don't like her. 
 I like her. 
 Don't tell her I said anything. 
 Of course. 
 (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR CLOSING) 
 So, you can sleep in here. 
 Obviously, I haven't slept in it, but it seems comfortable. 
 Ahhh, if you need to do your laundry, it's the... closet right next to the kitchen. 
 Yeah. 
 This place is really nice. 
 Yeah. 
 Still getting used to it, but I like it. 
 How much do you pay for it? 
 Probably too much. 
 Don't you have loans to pay off? 
 Yeah, Jacqueline actually put the deposit down, so that helps. 
 So you can take "in calls"? 
 No, I am paying her back. She was just helping. 
 Oh. 
 Here. 
 Just pay me back when you have it. 
 I have credit cards, I'm fine. 
 Speaking of which, let's go to lunch. 
 It's on me, it's the least I could do. 
 We'll have the forest mushrooms, the kale salad, the ahi tuna tartare, diver scallops and two mimosas... 
 Please. 
 Thanks. 
 (MUFFLED SOUNDS OF UPSCALE RESTAURANT) 
 You deserve it. 
 We deserve it. 
 So how is work? 
 Which work? 
 I'm currently burning a candle at three ends, which I didn't know was possible. 
 Maybe one should go. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 For now, it's fun. 
 And have you noticed that people are f*cking insane? 
 (SOUND OF CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Hello. 
 Christine. Hi, it's Jacqueline. 
 Listen, I have someone I'd love you to meet. 
 Are you free for lunch on Thursday? 
 Yeah, I can make that work. 
 I'm so sorry to hear that. 
 When did she pass away? 
 It's been eleven months now. 
 That's gotta be hard. 
 I think it's been harder on the kids. 
 Are you close to them? 
 I was... 
 Least I think I was. 
 But they're adults now. 
 They've got their own lives. 
 Why it's so nice to spend time with someone and just talk. 
 Especially to a... to a beautiful young woman. 
 We can talk whenever you like. 
 (SOUND OF CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Jacqueline? 
 Oh, she-she's wonderful. 
 We're having a really nice time together. 
 Declined? 
 Well, that's surprising. 
 Yeah. 
 Hang on. 
 I'm just gonna use the restroom. 
 Okay... 
 2226. 
 (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR CLOSING) 
 (SOUND OF TAKING OUT WINE BOTTLE) 
 (SLOW FOOTSTEPS IN HALLWAY) 
 (SOUND OF WOMAN SIGHING PASSIONATELY) 
 (SOUNDS OF ROCKING BED, COUPLE HAVING s*x) 
 Christine... 
 What is it? 
 Was having problems sleeping. 
 I'm really sorry, I shouldn't have brought him here. 
 Can I lie down beside you? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry, I should have asked. 
 I can give you half for letting me. 
 I'll give you $500. 
 I don't want your money. 
 Jacqueline won't call me back. 
 She won't tell me why. 
 Go to sleep. 
 I have to get up at six in the morning. 
 Oh really? f*ck, I'm sorry. 
 You're really warm. 
 Thank you for being there for me. 
 Of course. 
 Kiss me. 
 (SOUND OF WOMEN KISSING) 
 (EROTIC BREATHING)
