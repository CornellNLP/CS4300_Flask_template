 Previously on The Girlfriend Experience... 
 You do this kind of stuff all the time? 
 [pushing button on keyboard] 
 You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 Who sent you that? 
 Who sent it? 
 Say it! 
 It turns me on! 
 You sent it. 
 I didn't send that. 
 Look! 
 That's your f*cking email! 
 It didn't just go to me, too. It went to everybody. 
 It's all over for you. 
 It turns you on getting paid. 
 [hyperventilating] 
 What... what's the matter? 
 Someone needs to call 911. 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Okay, okay. 
 [urgent crying] 
 [forced breathing] 
 Try to breathe normally. 
 Everything's gonna be fine. 
 [Christine's difficult breathing] 
 Just breathe normally. 
 [more normal breathing] 
 That's good. 
 Okay, show's over! 
 Everybody back to work! 
 I'm David Tellis. 
 Managing Partner. 
 Is Christine gonna be okay? 
 Do you need to take her to a more private room? 
 Just tell me what you need. 
 She'll be fine. 
 Is there someone who can take her home? 
 Yeah. 
 Kayla... 
 Can you call a cab and go with her? 
 Yeah. 
 Can you call now, please? Thank you. 
 Everyone, back to work! 
 Kayla'll take care of you, okay? 
 [Christine's breathing more regularly] 
 [city in background] 
 Make sure you stay with her until she gets into her home. 
 Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. 
 Go slow. Watch your step. 
 [taxi door closing] 
 Do you wanna stop and get something before you get home? 
 Is there anything you need? 
 I'm fine. 
 Are you hungry? Do you want a hamburger or something? 
 Maybe. That actually sounds kinda good. 
 It does? 
 Uh, can we stop at Max's on Adams? 
 [door opening] 
 You have a nice apartment. 
 Are you okay? Do you want me to stay? 
 I'm good. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll see you. 
 See you. 
 [door opening and closing] 
 [shower water falling] 
 [soft erotic moaning] 
 [passionate sighing] 
 [tapping keys on keyboard] 
 [typing on keyboard] 
 I don't know how you feel about this, but I'd prefer to meet at my apartment, instead of at a hotel. 
 I'd just be more comfortable, if that's okay with you. 
 I've been with other women who, um, I can give you their numbers if you want to speak with them? 
 No, you sound wonderful. 
 That's very considerate of you though. 
 [taxi door opening] 
 [taxi door shutting] 
 O'Hare. American Airlines. 
 [taxi accelerating] 
 Hey, Abby. 
 We're worried sick. Why haven't you returned my calls? 
 I can't talk right now. 
 What the f*ck is going on? You're scaring me. 
 I'm fine. 
 Mom is really upset. We all are. 
 I can imagine. 
 But I can't talk about it right now. 
 I have to go into work. 
 Wha... what was that video? Why did you send it? 
 I have to go. 
 Thank you. 
 Passport please. 
 What is the purpose of your visit? 
 Visiting friends. 
 Where are you staying? 
 At the Essex on Richmond. 
 How long you staying? 
 Three days. 
 Hi, I have a room under Christine Reade. 
 I have you down for three nights. 
 Is the room quiet? 
 Yes, it's away from the elevators. 
 Great. 
 I'll need to see ID and a credit card. 
 How many keys? 
 Just one. 
 [elevator ascending] 
 [knocking on front door] 
 Just a second! 
 Hi, how long is this gonna take? 
 It's an overnight service. 
 You'll have them tomorrow by 8am. 
 Great. Here. 
 Thank you. 
 [Christine taking a shower] 
 [door opening and closing] 
 [high heels on marble floor] 
 I'm here to see Dennis Masterson. 
 And your name? 
 Amanda Hayes. 
 One moment. 
 [concierge dialing] 
 Mr. Masterson? Amanda Hayes is here to see you. 
 Certainly. 
 Penthouse Three. 
 Thanks. 
 [footsteps on marble floor] 
 Can I get you something to drink? 
 No, thanks. 
 This is for you. 
 Wow. 
 How was your flight? 
 It was good. 
 Thanks. 
 It's just something small. 
 It's from a little boutique. She hand-makes all her jewelry. 
 It's a bracelet. 
 I hope you like it. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Would you...? 
 Help me? 
 Sure. 
 I love it. 
 Really? 
 They have others. If you're in town for a few days, we can go together and pick out another one. 
 I like this one. 
 Would you like to look around? 
 Yes, um, I'm just gonna call my driver and tell him it'll be a while, I wasn't sure if you'd changed your mind. 
 Sure. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Yeah I'm gone I'm gonna be a while. 
 Okay, great. 
 Thanks. 
 The view's amazing. 
 You wanna see something fun? 
 Sure. 
 Wow! 
 You can also adjust the temperature, lighting and the sound system. 
 Do you want to try? 
 Sure. 
 Here. 
 Also controls the TV. 
 That's amazing. 
 Should we sit down? 
 [erotic breathing] 
 That feels good. 
 [passionate sighing] 
 [rapid, climactic breathing] 
 [hard gasps with orgasm] 
 [man gasping for air] 
 [return to normal breathing] 
 I think it's best if you leave. 
 Whatever you want. 
 [footsteps on stairway] 
 I had a really nice time. 
 I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me. 
 I can stay if you want to talk about it. 
 No, you need to leave. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 [shower water falling] 
 [typing rapidly on keyboard] 
 [exercise machine] 
 [Sound of piped-in bar music] 
 Got Stoli on the rocks? 
 You bet. 
 Start a tab. 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 How's the food? 
 Good. 
 What are you having? 
 The roasted chicken salad. 
 Sounds good. 
 So what... uh brings you to Toronto? 
 Work. 
 Oh yeah? 
 What do you do? 
 I don't mean to be rude, but I've had a long day and I just want to be alone. 
 I was just making conversation. 
 Understood. 
 Hi, this is Amanda. 
 Hi, Amanda. 
 I saw your ad on Ceres Amore. 
 What's your name? 
 Rick. 
 I'm looking at your photos right now. 
 I take it you like them? 
 Yeah. 
 What color are your eyes? 
 They're green. 
 What are you looking for? 
 What does your face look like? 
 I've been told I'm beautiful. 
 I don't think you'll be disappointed. 
 And when you cum? 
 What does your pussy taste like, bitch? 
 [cell phone buzzing] 
 This is Amanda. 
 Yeah, I saw your ad. Are you still in Toronto? 
 Yes. 
 Are you available now? 
 No, not until 6pm. 
 How much an hour? 
 A thousand an hour. Two-hour minimum. 
 You're okay with other women? 
 Yes. 
 I'm staying at the Trump, Room 5501. 
 What's your name? 
 Gary. 
 And your last name? 
 Barber. 
 Do you have any references? 
 Yeah, they'll be here. You want their numbers? 
 Yes, please. 
 [removing plastic cover] 
 [revolving door] 
 [busy city street receding in background] 
 [knocking on door] 
 [door opening] 
 Amanda, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Dana? 
 Monica. We spoke earlier. 
 Thanks. 
 Uh, do you party? 
 No, I don't. 
 But I'm fine with it. 
 They do, just so you know. 
 [snorting cocaine] 
 You're Amanda? 
 Yes. Gary? 
 That's Dana. 
 Here. Sit down. 
 Hi. Nice to meet you. 
 Thanks. 
 [Gary sighing] 
 So, Amanda... 
 Who are you and what's your story? 
 Wow, that's a tough question, um... 
 I was born in Philadelphia. 
 I live in Chicago now. 
 I'm on my second year of law school... 
 Want something to drink? 
 Sure. 
 You two look like you'd like each other. 
 You wanna kiss her? 
 Yeah... She's hot. 
 [gentle kissing] 
 You want a blow job? 
 Maybe later. 
 I wanna see your tits. 
 Show me your tits right now. 
 So when did you get here? 
 About an hour or so ago. 
 Around five. 
 I got here at noon. 
 I need some water. 
 You want anything? 
 No thanks. 
 I'm good. 
 This is how it was the last time, too. 
 How long have you known Gary? 
 This is only my second time seeing him. 
 So from you're Chicago? 
 Yeah. 
 And how long are you in town for? 
 Just a few days. 
 Do you work here often? 
 No, it's my first time. 
 It's... fun. 
 It's almost nine. 
 How long are you booked for? 
 Three hours. 
 I'm gonna go tell him I'm leaving. 
 [high heels on marble floor] 
 [high heels on carpet] 
 We're leaving. 
 I don't want you to go. 
 I want you both to stay. 
 Are you staying? 
 Yeah, overnight. 
 How much am I paying you? A thousand an hour? 
 Fifteen hundred. 
 [entering code, opening safe deposit box] 
 Here's ten thousand. 
 [snorting cocaine] 
 Here, count this to make sure. 
 [shuffling bills] 
 [elevator ascending] 
 [busy city street] 
 Taxi? 
 Yes. 
 How are you today? 
 Good, thanks. 
 Are you enjoying Toronto? 
 Very much, thanks. 
 Have a good day. 
 [car door shutting, taxi accelerating] 
 [piped-in bar music playing] 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Nice dress. 
 Thanks. 
 Who is it? 
 Halston. 
 Something to drink? 
 Ummm, I'm gonna wait. 
 Did you get some sleep? 
 A few hours. 
 Mmm. 
 Wonder how Dana held up? 
 She might still be there. 
 Maybe I would be too, if I liked to party. 
 Are you solely cash-based? 
 No, I set up a company and can take credit cards, but my clients rarely want to use them. 
 So you're new at this? 
 Eight to nine months. 
 I'm looking to expand my client base. 
 I'm trying to get rid of mine. 
 I've been doing this for six years. 
 It's just so easy. It's like going to an ATM. 
 But, what do you want to do? 
 I don't know. Have kids. 
 Oh, there they are. 
 [cell phone buzzing] 
 Hey, Colin. 
 Nice to see you. 
 You must be Amanda. 
 Hi. 
 I'm so sorry. Um, would you just excuse me for a second? 
 Sure. No problem. 
 Hey Martin, I'm just in the middle of something. 
 Could I call you back? 
 I need to speak to you now, if possible. 
 Okay, hold on. 
 Yes? 
 I've been trying to get a hold of you. 
 Are you okay? 
 You got the email? 
 Yes. Can you come in and meet? 
 I'm out of town. 
 Somebody sent the tape to Chicago Lister. 
 They just ran a story. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm just out of town. I needed to get away for a while. 
 We need to deal with this. When's the soonest you can get here? 
 I don't know, I'll have to check flights. 
 Tomorrow morning? 
 How bad is it? 
 Why don't we talk about it when you're here? 
 Come by my office as soon as you get in. 
 You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 Yes. 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 Say it! 
 It turns me on! 
 [man grunting during s*x] 
 [theme music rises powerfully, then stops abruptly] 
 Have you been to Aria yet? 
 That's the one in the Four Seasons, right? 
 Yeah, it's actually really good. 
 I ordered you a white wine. 
 Great. 
 I was starting to worry you were gonna bail on me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You have my full attention. 
 You smell good. 
 Thanks. 
 You from Toronto? 
 No... Originally uh, from the Midwest. 
 [inaudible conversations in the bar]
