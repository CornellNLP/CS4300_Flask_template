 ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP) 
 Michael amended his will two months ago. 
 I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells. 
 $500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne. 
 Are you Chelsea Rayne? 
 (PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Will you tell me the truth? 
 Sure. 
 What's your real name? 
 It's Annabel. 
 I'm really happy we finally get to meet you. 
 Jack's been talking about you for weeks. 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Hello? 
 I miss you already. 
 How did you get this number? 
 What's the problem? 
 Uh, someone sent you this. 
 I do not want you in my life, Jack. 
 Never call me again! 
 Learn this guy's face. 
 He's the devil. 
 My client is suing the sh1t out of his client. 
 It's not going to trial. 
 I got it. 
 I will make sure it is not going to trial. Tell me what my choices are. I wanna hear you say it. I'm gonna go. I'm leaving your money on the table. Christine? Who the f*ck are you? Tomorrow you're gonna call Peter Gramercy. And you're gonna tell him that you're disclaiming any and all interests in Michaels Cilic's estate. If you don't make this call, everyone will find out what you really do for a living. (SOUND OF HAIR DRYER BLOWING) My clients would literally kill for your hair. I hope they wouldn't literally kill anyone. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Sorry, I just... Okay. Yes? Peter Gramercy's office just sent over a disclaimer request. I could probably get you the money... Okay, so do that. But they say they have enough to prove prostitution. Excuse me, I just... Oh. I insisted on a gag clause. The money will be held in escrow for a year. If they breach it, try to out you, it'll render this agreement null and void and they'll have to pay you the money. Fine. But what is their case against me? "Hi, we hired some asshole to solicit s*x from a top-notch law student with no record, who turned him down. Can you arrest her?" I mean, yes, they can. It doesn't matter what the truth is. They have money. They're angry. - They will smear you, dear. Please don't call me "dear". I'd sign it. f*ck you, Martin! Hey, don't get mad at the messenger. He left the money for me! You know what we gotta do? Find you a boyfriend. You're not funny. I'm just juggling a lot right now. So is every other student. But I'm particularly concerned about your recent attendance, or lack thereof. I'm allowed three absences. I don't understand why there's cause for alarm. You're up to three already. It's not like you, that's all. I'm just making sure you're okay. I'm fine. Well, I'm glad to hear you're fine, but if you miss one more class, you'll have to take the course over. I got it under control, I know what I'm doing. Okay. Well, as long as you're aware. Now, soon after, frustrated with the process, he drafts a new summary, which then... Well, what does he do next, Christine? He needs someone to sign. Someone? Uh, a-a qualified... Well, there's a name for it... Justin. POSITA. And what does that mean, Christine? Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art. Correct. So, our client uses a POSITA, who, in this case, happens to also be his buddy... Christine! Just wanna talk. Look-look, I miss... I miss you. This is weird for me, too. But you've given me no other option here. This is not an option. Yeah, well, you-you're not returning my phone calls, my-my emails, my-my text messages... I- I feel like you've... you've painted me into a corner here, you pushed me into a corner, and that's-that's why I came here. I'm sorry, I don't know you. Christine, look... Don't go, don't...! Look, I just... I want to talk, okay? Turn the car off, I want to talk. I just want to talk! I want to talk! (SOUND OF CAR ENGINE ACCELERATING) You f*cking piece of sh1t! You f*cking dick! Back me into a f*cking corner! You wanna play victim, you f*cking dick? I will f*ck you up! (SOUND OF CAR STOPPING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hi, you've reached Ana. Can't get to the phone, so leave me a message. Thanks. Hey, Ana, it's Annabel! Finally calling about lunch. Um, I just wanted to know if you're available tomorrow? Call me back on my cell phone, um... or text me, either way. Alright, thanks. I feel weird talking to you about Jack because, obviously, you and I don't know each other very well. But I would not do this... if I didn't have to. I'm sure this is uncomfortable for you, because, obviously, you're very close to Jack and I'm his... ex-girlfriend... Essentially. Sure, okay. But I... I just... I... I just want you to check on him and see if he's okay. I would call him, but I-I honestly don't feel comfortable calling him. To be completely honest, I feel scared to call him. I... I don't think he would do anything to you. I wish I could agree with you. I still don't understand what he did that was so alarming. You need to do what you need to do, but... I don't want to put you in the middle of this. I feel terrible. I just... I just would like you to talk to him because his behavior needs to stop. He's threatening me. And disrupting my life. And I don't want to have to get legal about it. ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP) Because that would break my heart. ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) (SOUNDS OF CITY STREET) Hi there. Umm... That'll be $55.26. Was this in yesterday? Yeah, yesterday. How much it is? $55...? Uh, $55.20... Here's $60, keep the change. Oh, thank you. (CITY SOUNDS CLOSE IN) ♪ (THEME MUSIC AND CITY SOUNDS BUILD TO CRESCENDO) (PEACEFUL, FARAWAY SOUNDS OF THE CITY) (SOUND OF SIREN PASSING OUTSIDE) (SOUND OF TAPPING KEYS ON COMPUTER) (SPANISH-LANGUAGE FOLK SONG) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE GIGGLING) (MORE TAPPING KEYS ON COMPUTER) (SOUND OF LAUGHTER FROM COMPUTER WINDOW) (MORE LAUGHTER) Hey! Who's your friend back there? (MORE LAUGHTER) Lick him. You're sick. (SOUND OF CHRISTINE LAUGHING) You have excellent cheekbones. Thanks. (MORE TAPPING KEYS ON COMPUTER) Hi. What's your name? Okay. What are you doing? (SOUND OF MAN TAKING DEEP BREATH) Don't talk. (SOUND OF CHRISTINE'S EROTIC BREATHING) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE m*st*rb*t*ng) (SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING FROM MAN ONLINE) (SOUND OF MAN CLIMAXING) (SOUND OF COMPUTER TOP SLAMMED DOWN) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE EXHALING DEEPLY) sh1t! 
 
 (SOUND OF RESTAURANT PATRONS CHATTING ON TERRACE) ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP SOFTLY) ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) Christine? I was just leaving. Yeah, I can see that. You look nice. Yeah, I was just meeting some of my friends here, having a drink. Right. What are you actually doing here? I could ask you the same question. What? Are you following me? I was having lunch with my friends. Stop. I don't have time for this sh1t. I saw who you were sitting with. You need to think twice before entertaining childish conspiracy theories. Is that a threat? I'm just saying... it would be in your best interest not to mention a coincidental meeting between two friends. Clear? Hope you had a nice brunch. (SOUND OF DIALING NUMBER ON CELL PHONE) (SOUND OF PHONE RINGING) I'm at the third table from the entrance on the right, I'm wearing a pin stripe suit and admittedly, I'm in the loss of hair department... I'm so sorry, Simon, but I'm gonna have to cancel our date. This is very unprofessional. I know, I'm so sorry. Something actually came up last minute. It's not going to trial. I got it. I will make sure it is not going to trial. Our deal still stands. Checks go to QUORTA. (SOUND OF TAPPING ON KEYBOARD) It's not going to trial. I got it. I will make sure it is not going to trial. Our deal still stands. Checks go to QUORTA. It's not going to trial. I got it. I will make sure it is not going to trial. (SOUND OF PHOTOCOPY MACHINE) Hey. Oh hey. Umm... So I just- I got a call from I.T. They noticed that my password was being used on multiple computers at the same time, so... Okay. Well, I need more time. I'm just trying to find the files that you can't find. Yeah, I... Kayla, I'm trying to help you. Well don't, okay? 'Cause I don't want to lose my job. So... Don't use my password. Fine. Okay. Skip wants to see you. He's not happy. You wanted to see me? Ahhh... Why did you change my language in the Eisner application? You told me to err on the side of caution. Our client's Claim 15 seemed dangerously close to CME's already existing patent. "Seemed"? I asked you to run a simple clearance search, verifying facts... Not opinions. Our client isn't paying us for your opinion. It was a suggestion. I noted that in the margins. Next time, keep them to yourself. (LAWYERS CHATTING AS THEY PASS) (SOUNDS OF KNOCKING, DOOR OPENING) Christine Reade... Do you have time? Okay. You can go in. (SOUND OF DOOR SHUTTING) Look, I know we're not friends. Of course, we're friends. Great, we're friends. There's something I need to talk to you about. About David? Is this personal? Yes... No, no. Um, I have-I haven't talked to anyone about this because it could open Kirkland up to a malpractice suit. Um, you're heading XHP now, so I thought I'd tell you. David's intentionally throwing the XHP case. That's a very serious accusation. It's not an accusation. What's this? Play it. It's not going to trial. I got it. I will make sure it is not going to trial. Our deal still stands. Checks go to QUORTA. I have more. Like what? You should talk to the opposing counsel. To Ben Holgrem. ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP) (SOUND OF DOOR OPENING) Come in. (SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING) ♪ (THEME MUSIC FADES OUT) Have a seat. She knows about QUORTA. (DOOR OPENING) Hi, Mom. Christine, hi! Is this a good time? Uh, not really. What is it? A man just called the house, asking for you. He wouldn't leave his name or number. He said it was urgent. Did he say what it's about? No, but he asked if I was your mother. Well, what did you say? Well... I didn't tell him anything. I don't know who this person is. And he didn't he say who he was?  - No. Did you ask? Of course. I'm not stupid, Christine! I'm sure it was fine. I don't think there's anything to worry about it. It's probably just like a sales call or something. Okay. Thought you'd want to know. I don't think there's anything to worry about it. I'm gonna call you back. Okay. ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) (SOUND OF MOVING SHUTTERS, SLIDING DOOR CLOSING) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE TESTING LOCKED DOOR) ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) (SOUND OF REMOTE CONTROL) What are we going to do about her? I don't think she has much. If she did, she would've gone straight to the police already. Not if she wants leverage. Leverage for what? I don't think she's that smart. Look, I don't have a dick. And Ben's not dumb enough to dip his into some crazy, bitch intern. I'm not going to prison. He's not going to prison. By all means, if you'd like to, David... Maybe it'll all just blow over. Shut up, Ben. Christine... Come by my office, we'll finish our talk. Okay. I really don't think we should shy away from Heron. They're offering 30% equity. The profit margins could be huge. And what if they're not profitable? How soon can we terminate their contract? Six months after the application's approved. Six months? Think about it. (SOUND OF TAPPING ON KEYBOARD) (OFFICE TELEPHONE RINGING) Skip Hadderly's office this is Christine Reade. What did you tell Ana, you f*cking c**t? (SOUND OF HANGING UP RECEIVER) (OFFICE TELEPHONE RINGING AGAIN) Susan, will you set up lunch this week... with uh, in-house at Heron? Mm-hmm. Include Tariq Barr. Okay. Anything else? No, that's it, thank you. (SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING) ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP) Take it in all the way. ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? It turns you on, getting paid. (SOUND OF MAN GRUNTING DURING s*x) Say it. It turns me on! (SOUND OF MAN GRUNTING LOUDER) Take it in all the way. You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? It turns you on, getting paid. ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP POWERFULLY) Say it. It turns me on! (MAN GRUNTS)
