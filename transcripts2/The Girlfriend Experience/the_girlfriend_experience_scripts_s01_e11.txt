 Previously on The Girlfriend Experience... 
 Mom is really upset. We all are. 
 I can't talk right now. 
 What was that video? Why did you send it? 
 I have to go. 
 [man having orgasm] 
 I think it's best if you leave. 
 Whatever you want. 
 So you're new at this? 
 Eight to nine months. 
 I'm looking to expand my client base. 
 How much am I paying you? A thousand an hour? 
 Fifteen hundred. 
 Here's ten thousand. 
 Colin. 
 Nice to see you. 
 You must be Amanda. 
 Hi. 
 I'm so sorry. Um, would you just excuse me for a second? 
 Hey Martin, I'm just in the middle of something. 
 Can I call you back? 
 I need to speak to you now, if possible. 
 Somebody sent the tape toChicago Lister. 
 They just ran a story. 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 [passionate breathing] 
 Say it! 
 [sound of taxi driving] 
 [cell phone buzzing] 
 I'm glad I didn't scare you away. 
 Hmmm, not at all. 
 I was hoping to hear from you again. 
 Where are you? 
 Chicago. 
 Can you come see me this weekend? 
 I can't, I'm taking a break for a while. 
 But we can talk like this. 
 It's my fault. 
 You don't want to see me. 
 That's not true. I'm happy to see you. 
 There's nothing wrong with what we did. 
 Could I see your face? 
 I can't. 
 Is there something else you'd like to see? 
 Yes. 
 [erotic breathing] 
 Excuse me. 
 Sorry, am I in your way? 
 No need to apologize. 
 How's your day? 
 How do you think? 
 Well, I can only imagine, especially for interns. 
 What exactly can you imagine? 
 Just have a lot to take in. 
 I wanna make something very clear. 
 You're making me feel very, very uncomfortable. 
 Yeah, uncomfortable how? 
 What-what are you talking about? 
 I think you know what I'm talking about. 
 Interns are just all stretched too thin? 
 You're all overworked. 
 I don't think that's what you meant. 
 I dunno what you're talking about... 
 Okay. 
 Let's all just take it down a notch. 
 Are you waiting for me to f*ck you? 
 Yeah. 
 And if I don't? 
 Then I'll have to fire you. 
 David Tellis was your boss? 
 I was his intern. 
 I wanna sue for sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. 
 Kirkland might argue that you intentionally brought this on yourself. 
 That you incited these reactions and recorded them to file a lawsuit, but, given the balance of power between you and David Tellis, you have a strong case. 
 I have something else. 
 You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 Yes! 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 So this could be misconstrued as an act of prostitution. 
 How do we all wanna handle it? 
 Christine knowingly made the tape with her boyfriend at the time. 
 They were role-playing. 
 And the fact that his voice is distorted? 
 It was obviously put out to humiliate and shame Christine. 
 She broke up with him a month prior. 
 So are we saying he released it? 
 At this point, it doesn't matter who released it. 
 Kirkland mishandled it. 
 The goal is to force a settlement. 
 Okay, got it. 
 We should set a follow-up with Chicago Lister to get out Christine's side of the story. 
 Do you feel comfortable doing interviews? 
 Yeah, I have nothing to hide. 
 Good. 
 Make sure to stress your embarrassment. 
 It's important to get people to sympathize with you. 
 I am extremely embarrassed. 
 As you can imagine, this has been very humiliating for me. 
 It was a private moment between two adults that I didn't think would be seen. 
 Did you accept money in exchange for s*x? 
 I'm not answering that question. 
 Are you concerned that your law career is over? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 I've worked really hard, and spent a lot of money to get to this point. 
 You could go into private practice. 
 Is that a joke? 
 No. 
 No, I'm being serious. 
 I'd like to remain optimistic, but unfortunately as a woman, it's difficult to be seen as a sexual person and a competent professional at the same time. 
 Unless s*x is your profession. 
 You did say you like to get paid for s*x. 
 I like s*x. 
 I was role-playing. Is that a problem? 
 So you knew you were being recorded? 
 Yes. 
 Again, it was a private moment with a person that I cared about. 
 The tape was for us, not for the public. 
 Why did your ex release it? 
 I don't know who released it. 
 Well, his voice is distorted on the tape, and you said you broke up with him a month earlier. 
 You don't think there's a connection? 
 You don't think he did it out of revenge? 
 Again, I don't know if he released the tape. 
 We ended on good terms. 
 So... 
 You're not angry, at all? 
 Of course, I'm angry! 
 I'm angry that my family and friends have to deal with this. 
 I'm angry that I lost my internship. 
 I'm angry that Kirkland didn't handle things better and that people jumped to conclusions before hearing my side of the story. 
 Go ahead. 
 Go ahead. 
 Hi. 
 Hey... 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 There's nothing to worry about. They don't have any evidence. 
 Just let me do the talking. 
 I'm not worried. 
 Miss Reade? 
 Yes. 
 I'm Justin Grevillius, aide to Assistant District Attorney Stanley. 
 I'm Martin Bayley, Miss Reade's attorney. 
 We spoke on the phone. 
 Yeah. 
 This way. 
 We saw theChicago Listerstory. 
 Who is the man with you in the video? 
 He was a former boyfriend of my client. 
 She doesn't want to reveal his identity. 
 Why not? It's a criminal act if he hacked her email. 
 We don't know who emailed the tape. 
 Well, we could find out. 
 Doesn't matter, my client doesn't want to press charges. 
 Why not? 
 Cause you're engaging in prostitution? 
 There was no money involved. 
 My client was simply role-playing. 
 You don't have a case. 
 Why do you want me to delete all our correspondence? 
 Is it 'cause you're worried I'm gonna tell someone about us? 
 I'm not worried. You're gonna do what you're gonna do. 
 Does Megan know? 
 Did you tell your wife about us? 
 I don't understand why you won't talk to me. 
 I don't know what I did wrong. 
 I miss spending time with you. 
 Stay the f*ck away from me! 
 You are f*cking insane! 
 Miss Reade's lawyer also sent over a video recording of you having s*x with her in your apartment. 
 Is there something else you wanna tell us? 
 No? Nothing? 
 You're through. 
 [sound of office noise in background] 
 [office door opening and closing] 
 [muted silence] 
 [David packing briefcase] 
 I'm leaving for the day. 
 You have a call with Lisa Harrison at three. 
 Do you want me to re-schedule? 
 I'll have to get back to you. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine, thanks. 
 
 
 
 [car door unlocking, opening] 
 [car door closing] 
 f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! 
 [painful breathing] 
 David's intentionally throwing the XHP case. 
 That's a very serious accusation. 
 It's not an accusation. 
 Play it. 
 It is not going to trial. 
 I got it. I will make sure it is not going to trial. 
 Our deal still stands. 
 Yeah. 
 The check goes to Quorta. Still the same. 
 What do you know about Quorta? 
 Nothing. 
 Well why do you think she came to you? 
 I'm not entirely sure. Maybe because I took an interest in her, as a young woman starting her career. 
 Did she mention her sexual relationship with David? 
 No, not to me. 
 She's threatening sexual harassment and hostile work environment lawsuits. 
 We're going to have to negotiate. 
 We want you to be part of it. 
 You need a woman to be there. 
 You'll be taking David's position as Managing Partner. 
 Your client accessed confidential files without permission, sent a sexually-explicit video of herself to the entire staff at Kirkland, targeted her co-workers, and secretly recorded their reactions, violating state wiretapping laws. 
 She purposely created this scenario to make herself look like a victim and bring suit. 
 Well, that's one way to look at it. 
 But from another perspective, one of your managing partners coerced a young intern into a sexual relationship. 
 He publicly humiliated her in an effort to discredit her and to stop her from revealing information that could damage your firm. 
 Are you suggesting Tellis sent out the s*x tape himself? 
 Are you sure that he didn't? 
 At the end of the day, it doesn't matter. 
 If my client continues to go public with further details about your firm, you will lose. 
 The rest is just noise. 
 Write her a check. 
 Christine? 
 Jacqueline? 
 Wow, it's so good to see you! 
 Are you, ahh, meeting someone? 
 I am, actually. 
 My lawyer. 
 Oh good! 
 So tell me, what've you been up to? 
 How's the apartment? 
 It's great. 
 I'm just getting settled, starting to feel like it's mine. 
 I think I know what you mean. 
 Wow, that is... just a beautiful top. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm really happy to see that things are going so well for you. 
 I've actually gotta get going. 
 Okay, I understand. 
 [busy restaurant in background] 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Kirkland's gonna settle. 
 They wanna resolve it immediately. 
 How much? 
 A million. 
 They're insisting on a gag clause. 
 Can we get more? 
 You should take it. You don't understand. 
 You've already won. 
 [laughter] 
 Do you know him? 
 No. 
 We could have met at my office. 
 It's fine. 
 [signing, shuffling papers] 
 There are two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, hardwood floors, a washer/dryer, and a gourmet kitchen with a granite island. 
 There's also an indoor pool and a 24-hour fitness center. 
 It's a quiet building. 
 Mostly professionals. 
 Hi, Amanda... 
 Hi, Dennis! 
 I missed seeing you. 
 I miss seeing you, too. 
 How are you? 
 I'm good! 
 I want to touch you. 
 [Dennis m*st*rb*t*ng] 
 I wanna cum on your face. 
 Do it. I want you to. 
 [Dennis climaxing] 
 [Christine reaching orgasm] 
 There's a number of options, depending on your income. 
 I'm keeping a low profile. 
 At the moment, I'm just camming, which isn't very much money, but I plan on starting back up again in the next few months. 
 I understand. Whenever you're ready. 
 One option is to go off-shore, but that can be very costly to set up and maintain, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're making a substantial amount of money. 
 Another way is to set up a corporation anonymously, either in Wyoming or in Nevada. 
 You'll be the sole shareholder, but the registered agent will be the primary contact. 
 And they'll go on public record, not you. 
 And most importantly, you can declare your income to the IRS, which will keep them off your back. 
 Is Amanda your real name? 
 Yes. 
 Show me your face. 
 You'll have to meet me in person to see my face. 
 Show me your pussy. 
 Push it up to the front of the screen. 
 [man's erotic breathing] 
 [man reaching orgasm] 
 [sound of soft kiss] 
 You're so beautiful, Meg. 
 [sound of sensual kissing] 
 I missed you. 
 Please stop saying that. 
 [passionate sighing] 
 Take off your shirt. 
 I wanna keep it on. 
 I wanna feel your skin. 
 I wanna keep it on. 
 [erotic breathing] 
 I can't... 
 Huh? 
 I can't! 
 I can't. 
 I can't stop thinking about you with other women. 
 David... 
 Chris. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 Good. Jim's gonna meet us in the conference room. 
 Great. 
 So how's the family? 
 Great. 
 Thanks for asking, how's yours? 
 Kids aren't in jail yet, so it's a good week. 
 [men laughing] 
 You need anything? Water, coffee? 
 No, I'm good. 
 All right. 
 And thanks for making the time. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Well, people talk. 
 Hmmm. 
 But we know that you're a good lawyer and uh... 
 We wanted to get your side. 
 Well I'm not exactly sure what you've heard, Christine Reade, an intern, accused me of... uh, being sexually involved with her, and it wasn't true. 
 She's unstable and had a nervous breakdown. 
 I discussed it with the other partners and we decided the best way to minimize the damage was to part ways. 
 And how long were you at Kirkland? 
 Fifteen years. 
 Well, that's unfortunate. 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 Say it! 
 It turns me on! 
 [man having s*x] 
 [recording ends] 
 [man's heavy breathing comes up] 
 Take it in all the way. 
 You like getting paid for s*x, don't you? 
 Yes. 
 It turns you on, getting paid. 
 [man moaning with sexual pleasure] 
 Say it! 
 It turns me on! 
 [man climaxing, then silence] 
 [speed-dialing, cell phone ringing] 
 It's David. 
 I wanna see you. 
 [sounds of opening package] 
 [Christine arranging s*x toys] 
 [sound of cell phone buzzing] 
 Yes? 
 It's David. 
 I wanna see you. 
 Why? 
 I wanna talk. I have something I need to tell you. 
 I'm meeting someone. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 You're not staying? 
 I have to be somewhere soon. 
 I thought we were gonna have lunch. 
 What did you wanna talk about? 
 You know I'm no longer at Kirkland. 
 Can I get you something to drink? 
 No, I'm not staying. 
 Oh, let me know if you change your mind. 
 I'm not at Kirkland. They let me go. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't know that. 
 What did you think would happen? 
 You recorded our conversations. 
 You recorded us having s*x... 
 I didn't do anything wrong. 
 I thought we could have a serious conversation. 
 So did I. I was an intern. 
 You just wanted to f*ck me and get rid of me when it wasn't convenient for you anymore. 
 You didn't seem to care about my career. 
 What "career"? 
 I didn't ask for this. 
 I just dealt with it. 
 So you don't have a job at Kirkland anymore, how is that my problem? 
 You have connections. 
 Go out and get another job and stop blaming me. 
 You recorded us having s*x, and you used it against me. 
 You planned this. 
 Welcome to the club. 
 And that video of you f*cking that guy? 
 You were f*cking him for money. 
 How the f*ck do you know? 
 You're guessing. 
 You were paid to be there. 
 Everybody's paid to be everywhere. 
 It's called an economy. 
 You just want the money. 
 I want everything about it! 
 I f*cked people, David, but I didn't f*ck them over, like you were doing with XHP. 
 And you started this, you wanted this! 
 And I'm selling, yeah, but I know exactly what I'm selling, and they know exactly what they're buying. 
 Yeah, cause you're a f*cking whore! 
 What did you say? 
 You called me a f*cking whore. 
 Say it again. 
 [splashing water] 
 [Christine's rapid footsteps] 
 [elevator door closing, elevator descending] 
 [man's erotic sighing] 
 Don't stop. Keep going. 
 Are you close? 
 Don't talk, just watch me.
