 When did she pass away? 
 It's been eleven months now. 
 That's gotta be hard. 
 What I should do is I should just stay here with you. 
 I'd love that. 
 Well, I'd be happy. 
 You got lazy and lost XHP. 
 I got this. 
 You know, I'd really like to think I was right considering you for Managing Partner. 
 Learn this guy's face. 
 He's the devil. 
 My client is suing the sh1t out of his client. 
 Speak of the devil... 
 Did you two come together? 
 Ah. 
 He's signing but he wants Erin to head it. 
 (SOUND OF DOOR SLAMMING) 
 Want to get a beer? 
 You tell me your goals. 
 (PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 (STATIC ON CELL PHONE) 
 Hello? 
 Uh, you're breaking up a little bit. 
 Is this a uh, secure line? 
 It is. 
 Sorry, I just have really bad reception. 
 I asked how you got my number? I got your number from Kevin Young. Okay. Listen... There's one more thing, I'm travelling with my wife. I understand. Do you? I do. Is it okay if I call you back Tuesday and we can confirm and sort out the details? Of course. I'll speak to you soon. Great. Thank you. Bye. Sounds like business is going good. Yeah, it's fine. That's good. To be honest, I'd rather spend all my time with you. Oh, yeah? Just as long as you know I don't expect that from you. You know that, right? I know. Okay. Just being honest. Okay. What we should do, you and I, is sit down, and figure out an arrangement and make that happen. Yeah, that'd be amazing. I'd love that. Me, too. Ah, thought you'd forgotten me. Now, you want something? No, thank you. Cheers. Is there any way we could be alone? A bottle of vodka, get some popcorn... Maybe get two bottles of vodka. Oh, and the girl wants, she wants canned tuna, so see if you can find some of that uh, dolphin-safe stuff, any organic, you know what to look for right? Okay. Dolphin-safe, that's the way to go. (SOUND OF MOTOR ON DINGY ACCELERATING) (EROTIC BREATHING) (SOUND OF THUNDERSTORM BREAKING) (SOUND OF SPLASHING WATER) (SOUND OF WAVES, THUNDERSTORM IN DISTANCE) Michael! (SOUND OF WAVES BREAKING ACROSS YACHT'S STERN) Michael! Michael? ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP SOFTLY) ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) Michael! Michael! It's great, huh? What's the matter? ♪ (THEME MUSIC SOFTENS) ♪ (VOICES MUTED UNDER THEME MUSIC) (SOUND OF YACHT'S MOTOR ACCELERATING) ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS, THEN FADES OUT) (SOUND OF PHONE RINGING) Peter Gramercy. Hi, this is Chelsea Rayne. I got your message, just calling you back. Yes. I represent the estate of Michael Cilic. The estate? He passed away last Thursday evening. Cardiac arrest. My condolences. He named you as a beneficiary in his will. I was hoping you could come by my office, so that we could go over the details. ♪ (PIPED-IN BAR MUSIC) Sam? Are you Chelsea? This is Shannon. Hi... Chelsea. Excuse me. Yes, sir? You serve a 18-year-old scotch with ice that looks like it came from a soda fountain? Could I have a more substantial block of ice back there? I'll check, sir. Yes, please check. And if you don't have the proper ice, just leave it neat. Right away. So, how'd you guys meet? Do you want to...? No, go ahead. Uh, a mutual friend's birthday party. It was pretty funny. I uh... I didn't like him at all. I- I thought he was really conceited. He wouldn't talk to me. I must have asked him about a hundred questions, and he just- he wouldn't say anything. Turns out he's just shy. I'm not shy. Yes, you are. No, I am not. Yes, you are. Okay. That's enough. Well, it seems like you guys have a lot of fun together. You guys wanna do some shots? It's a $12,000 watch. Makes phone calls, never lost a second. She is $3,000. Where the f*ck is she? I know. Yeah. (SOUND OF CHRISTINE CRYING) (TURNS ON WATER) (SOUND OF SPLASHING WATER ON CHRISTINE'S FACE) I mean what am I paying her for exactly? - I don't know. I guess to leave. No, don't talk about money. Sweetie, why don't we call you a cab? No, no. I'm fine. Oh honey, can you...? Should we go over here? (SOUND OF TRIPPING ON RUG) (LAUGHS) This damn rug! No. Are you okay? I'm so sorry, I never do this. It's okay. Three thousand f*cking dollars. Do you need to use the bathroom again? Let's just get her clothes back on. (SOUND OF FAUCET RUNNING) (CELL PHONE BEEPS) (SOUND OF CELL PHONE RINGING ON OTHER END) Hello. Are you sleeping? (PASSIONATE SIGHING) ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS POWERFULLY) Harder. Harder. What's going on with you? Nothing. (SOUND OF DAVID GRUNTING) (EROTIC BREATHING IN SYNCH WITH THRUSTS) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE CLIMAXING) Did you cum? Yeah, did you? No. No... I'm... Are you stressed out? No. I promised I'd take my kids to school. You can just tell me to leave. I'm not your friend. Maybe I can be... at some point. But not at four o'clock in the morning. Feel free to crash here. Take a shower. Whatever. I gotta go. (SOUND OF FALLING WATER) (DOOR OPENING, CLOSING) David? David, is that you? (SOUNDS OF AN INTRUDER) (KEYS JINGLING) (SOUND OF ARRANGING FILE BOX) I'll be out in a second. (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR CLOSING) ♪ (SOUND OF SHOWER STILL RUNNING, THEME MUSIC BUILDS) (DOOR CLOSES) (ELEVATOR DINGS) Christine, hi. Erin. I thought I heard someone. You're here early. Yeah, I just wanted to get here before the day starts getting crazy. Get some work done. Is that something I can help you with? No, just... getting familiar with David's work, going through my own process. Oh, I'm sure you are. You want to grab lunch today? We can talk about your experience at the firm so far. I have an opening at two. Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. I'd love that. Cool. I'll see you at two. 
 
 But uh, you know, when we find it, we will, so... oh gentleman, I just have to go but you listen... It's not official, and the committee still needs to make the final vote, but it's clear the way everyone's leaning. I'm sorry, I'm not clear what you're saying. They're promoting you to Managing Partner. Next week. Goes without saying, don't tell them I told you. That's... That's great, that's... Huh... I just wanted to give you some lead time so you could get things in order. What about XHP? Erin's heading it. You don't have to worry about that. Managing Partner is a high-level position. I've been working with XHP for two years. I'd like to see it through. Continue working closely with Erin on it. If you wanna put in the extra time, go for it. But you're only getting one salary. (LAUGHS) I know. We'll consider it pro bono work. (CHUCKLES) Congratulations. Mmm. You know, I've heard great things about your work. How's it going with David? It's great. I'm really learning a lot. It's really impressive how much he can juggle. The Sancerre. (SOUND OF GLASSES CLINKING) Thanks. Are we ready to order? Not quite yet. Did you know he's going through a divorce? It must be a trying time for him. He didn't uh, mention that. Seventeen years. Megan... You met at the party. He's got two kids, Chris and Kyle. Sixteen and fourteen. I shouldn't bring it up. I just thought you should know, in case it changes his behavior at work. Sometimes he doesn't think before he acts. But... You work with him. You're smart. I'm sure you've noticed that. Yeah, I mean he- he definitely knows what he wants. Yeah. That's a great way to put it: "He knows what he wants." Thank you for being honest with me though. Anytime. (ERIN CLEARS THROAT) So thorough. You're leading this now. You got me into this. Into XHP's pants? Mmm... His name is Emery. Well, the names change, you're just using the tools at your disposal. How's Christine? Nice deflection tactic. As your intern? That's not what you were asking. I don't need your help. Yes, you do. No, I don't. If anything, I can focus better without you in my f*cking face, making snarky comments. They're promoting me. To Managing Partner? No, to Head of Maintenance. Yeah, Managing Partner. Sorry. That was shitty. I just wanted to let you know before they did. I asked to stay on XHP with you. Thanks for the consolation prize. I know. You deserved it. No, I didn't. Have a seat. You live in the city? Yes. Okay. Well... Michael amended his will two months ago. I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family. I'm sure this is very hard for them. $500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne. Are you Chelsea Rayne? All Michael left was your telephone number. He said you two had become very close. We were very close. You'll need more than a telephone number to prove your identity to the Probate Court. Do you have an attorney? We saw each other once or twice a week for the past four-and-a-half, five months. He was always generous, but I did not expect this. I'm sorry, I don't have any other lawyers that I trust that I can talk to about this. Mmm, admittedly, I was looking forward to a nice lunch and a little bit of... You know. I didn't know this was gonna be a business lunch. Okay, how many um, "clients" or... "men" do you see? Is that necessary? So I'm gonna help you, but you gotta be straight with me. Come on. A few, including you. Does your family know? No. If you decide you want this inheritance, and uh, you're willing to prove that you're Chelsea, it becomes public record. Anyone has access to the will once it goes through Probate. I'm gonna have to think about that. Well, take some time. Can I ask you another question? Go ahead. Ask away. Why would two lawyers from opposing teams share information? Unless the judge ordered it, they would have no reason to. That's illegal. That's-that's collusion. Right. What kind of case is this? Medical patent. What's it worth? Billions? There you go. There's a whole host of reasons right there. You sure that's what's going on? No. No, I can't be certain. Now, I got a question for you. This, me and you, now. This is business, right? It's always been business. (SOUND OF MARTIN'S LAUGHTER) (BACKGROUND NOISE OF LAW OFFICES) You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly. Why? I don't know. Talk to Evans? David didn't say. He must have said something. He must have given a reason why. No, he didn't. He doesn't have to. He just said he wants a new intern. Skip's great, you'll like him. Just let it go. I don't think this will take that long, will it? Well, I cancelled the coffee, I doubt we'll be done before it gets here. You boys take it easy on me, alright? (CHUCKLES) Before we make our final decision, we'd just like to hear from you, how you see our firm moving forward. Think of it as a... conversation. Right. Casual conversation across from five men staring at me. Look... You know me. I'm not an idealist. We need to move in directions which may not feel right. The market is changing at a rate that is exponential our current resources. (CAR UNLOCKING) I want to see you. I'm sorry, we can't keep doing this. I know. Just one more time? Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, she is. Mmm-hmm. (WHISPERS) Just a second. She's just an intern. There's nothing to worry about. I checked everything. It's not going to trial, I got it. I will make sure that it is not going to trial. Yeah. Our deal still stands. Yeah. Checks go to Quorta. Still the same. Alright, I gotta go. (SOUND OF CHRISTINE KNOCKING ON DOOR) Sorry, I had to go to the bathroom. Who was that? That? That was Ben. You met him. He and I... We used to know each other... From college. Yeah. Ben Holgrem, I met him in your office. His client's suing the sh1t out of our client. You know. You're still in school? You'll get it, when your friends start working for different sides. I don't have any friends. ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP) (WATER RUNNING) (WATER TURNS OFF) Are you waiting for me to f*ck you? Yeah. And if I don't? Then I'll have to fire you. Your skin. It feels so good, I want to pass out. Oh, man. ♪ (THEME MUSIC BUILDS) ♪ (THEME MUSIC FADES OUT) Hey... We're really happy to have you on board. I'm just gonna have you read a few articles of the work I'm doing so-so you can get up to speed. Okay? Great. And Sara, could you- could you get our copy of the Eisner application? And listen, if you need anything at all, door's always open, okay? Great. Thanks, Skip. Thank you. Yeah. Don't be fancy. Okay. I promise I won't make it more complicated than it has to be. Just cut and paste. Real easy. Okay, great. (SOUND OF DOOR TO RESTROOM CLOSING) (SOUND OF TOILET SEAT CLOSING) ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES BACK UP) Are you waiting for me to f*ck you? Yeah. And if I don't? Then I'll have to fire you. (SOUND OF REWINDING) It's not going to trial, I got it. I will make sure it is not going to trial. Our deal still stands. Checks go to Quorta.
