 Previously on The Girlfriend Experience... 
 But I actually enjoy it. 
 I- I like meeting new people, I like having s*x, And I only do it a few times a month. 
 This woman, Jacqueline, vets them for me and takes care of the bookings. 
 Why? Do you want to meet her? 
 I can introduce you, if you want. 
 You just have to want to do it. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 My big question is... 
 Why would I go with you when I can do this myself? 
 The hours that you would spend finding and then vetting clients could be spent with clients, making money. 
 I'm the infrastructure. 
 You don't work for me, you work with me. 
 And if you're unhappy, you leave. 
 There's no contract. 
 Don't worry. No one will ever see your eyes. 
 (CLICKING CAMERA) 
 Maybe his wife's coming to town, or maybe he's just not that into me anymore. 
 Either way, I have to pack up my sh1t and leave. 
 Just stay with me until you figure it out. 
 Jacqueline won't call me back. 
 She won't tell me why. 
 (EROTIC SIGHING) 
 Hi. 
 Hey, I don't have much time, I have back-to-back meetings all day so... 
 I hear it went very well with Michael. 
 I hope the whole widower thing wasn't too intense. 
 It's fine. I know what the deal is. 
 Okay. 
 I'm worried about Avery. 
 Why won't you talk with her? 
 Because she is erratic and unreliable. 
 She needs some help. 
 She's staying with me. 
 She's not in school. She's broke. 
 How is that my problem? 
 She said you're taking clients away from her. 
 (LAUGHS) 'Course she did. 
 She loves to play the victim. 
 I have a business to run. 
 I have to judge pretty quickly whether I should work with someone. 
 Because the difference between being basically able to trust someone and really being able to trust someone is huge. 
 What are you getting at? 
 Christine, she booked clients that I gave her on the side without telling me. 
 Is that something you condone? 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Look, if you want to help her, help her. 
 But if you're smart, you'll keep your distance. 
 Don't let her seduce you. 
 Sorry, I really do have to go. 
 Just... 
 Be careful with Avery. 
 Okay? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 How's it goin'? Good. 
 Good to see you. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Do you understand how much I'm trusting you by telling you this? 
 And why it took me a while to call you back? 
 It's really interesting. 
 You think I'm f*cked up. 
 Not at all. You seem very clear. 
 I am. 
 So how's business school? 
 (MOANING) 
 (SOUND OF MAN GRUNTING) 
 (SOUND OF MORE REGULAR BREATHING) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 (ELEVATOR DINGS) 
 Akers is out. 
 Really? 
 Barr confirmed it this morning. 
 Hey, Neil. 
 Come on in. 
 I hear you're leaving. 
 Who told you? 
 Carson? 
 Yeah, it was a tough decision, but you know how it is, David. 
 I have my family to think of. 
 But who knows, maybe I'll hate it and come crawling back in a few weeks, begging for another chance. 
 Oh, I'm giving you LSI and Polycom. 
 And XHP? 
 I'm taking them with me. 
 I don't know what else to say. 
 They came to me, David. 
 Fair game. 
 How long have you known you were leaving Kirkland? 
 Your ten o'clock with Novak. 
 Hey, XHP are yours. 
 If they're unhappy with the work I did, not much I can do about it now. 
 I just wanted you to know, in case you need any help... transitioning. 
 Oh, I appreciate you offering. 
 You and Carla still coming on the 14th? 
 Wouldn't miss it for the world. 
 It's Carla's favorite. 
 Great. 
 We'll have a few in your honor. 
 Akers is a snake. 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 He won. You got lazy and lost XHP. 
 Understand? 
 I completely understand. 
 I have no f*cking idea how to absorb this loss. 
 They accounted for 5% of our billing. 
 I understand. 
 Please stop saying that. 
 Let me fix this. 
 How? 
 Trust me. 
 I can get them back. 
 Wright is being unreasonable. 
 These kinds of cases, they take time. 
 He knew there were gonna be mistrials. 
 I can turn him around. 
 I got this. 
 I'd really like to think I was right considering you for Managing Partner. 
 Christine... 
 Call accounting, and get a record of all the hours we billed for XHP last quarter. 
 Got it. 
 Get it for the entire year. 
 f*ck! 
 (SOUND OF APARTMENT DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) 
 Hi. 
 Have you seen Jacqueline lately? 
 We had coffee last week. 
 Did she talk about me? 
 No. 
 Really? 
 Are you sure my name didn't come up? 
 Not even once? 
 Yes. You didn't come up. 
 'Cause she's still not returning my phone calls. 
 And I know she got to Garrett. 
 I know she did. There's no other way. 
 He was obsessed with me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Do you want some? 
 No. 
 I dropped out. 
 Officially. 
 You withdrew? 
 Yeah. 
 I hate it. I wanna do something else. 
 How's your coveted internship going? 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Blackmail her. 
 f*ck up her life. 
 I'm so glad not to be in f*cking law school anymore. 
 Who knows, maybe I'll go on vacation. 
 I love vacations. 
 ♪ (PIPED-IN BAR MUSIC WITH HARD BEAT) 
 Kevin? 
 Chelsea? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Jacqueline wasn't kidding. 
 You're stunning. 
 Thanks. 
 So, did she get the transfer? 
 I assume so. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 So you're here 'till Friday? 
 Yeah... 
 Yeah. 
 And do you come to town often or...? 
 No, not very often. 
 Ah, about once every other month or so... 
 Although that could change. 
 Why is that? 
 Because of you. 
 Whoa... 
 Kevin, slow down. 
 For your own sake. 
 I can tell already. 
 Sorry. 
 I guess I'm just a little nervous. 
 It's been a while for me and... 
 I'm married... 
 And you're just... spectacular. 
 I'm glad you think so. 
 We have time. There's no need to rush. 
 (EROTIC BREATHING) 
 Relax. 
 Touch me. 
 (MORE EROTIC BREATHING) 
 (MUFFLED SILENCE OF PLUSH HOTEL ROOM) 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Hello? 
 Avery? 
 She cleaned out my accounts. She took all my money. 
 What? Who? 
 Jacqueline. 
 What are you talking about? 
 She had access to your bank accounts? 
 Yeah, I know. It was stupid of me. I'm sorry. 
 
 
 
 (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) 
 Avery? 
 Avery? 
 (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR SWOOSHING OPEN) 
 (SOUND OF DETERMINED FOOTSTEPS) 
 Hi! What a surprise. 
 Cleaned out her accounts? 
 You know what? You know, now's not a good time. 
 You f*cking used Avery! 
 Avery used us both. 
 You're a f*cking leech! 
 (SOUND OF CRASHING PLATE) 
 (SOUND OF RAPID, ANGRY FOOTSTEPS) 
 f*ck! 
 (SOFT KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Got a minute? 
 Close the door. 
 (SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING) 
 What were you gonna do? 
 Make a deal. Reduce our rates. 
 I'm not convinced that'll be enough. 
 Everyone's got their price tag. 
 Yeah, that much I know. 
 You look tired. 
 You have a way of avoiding the point. 
 I don't wanna bring you into this. 
 Office, can you hold please? 
 (SOUND OF RAPID FOOTSTEPS) 
 You're late. 
 I know, I- 
 I had a doctor's appointment. Sorry. 
 Erase "sorry" from your vocabulary. 
 Just be on time. 
 (SOUNDS OF RINGING PHONES) 
 Hey... 
 What is it? 
 Um... 
 There's something I want to talk to you about. 
 Okay. 
 I'm thinking of leaving Jacqueline... 
 Breaking out on my own. 
 Ahhh... 
 Well, she called me. 
 I was wondering about that. 
 I don't want to put you in the middle of this. 
 And you know I love spending time with you, and I'd hate to do anything to jeopardize that. 
 I just... hope you'll still consider seeing me. 
 And if you're not comfortable with that, I can wait. 
 Come here. 
 Come on. 
 Now how long have we been seeing each other? 
 Nearly two months. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 And I'm here with you. 
 You're the one I want to be with, not Jacqueline. 
 Oh, come here. 
 Just let me know how you want to handle it. 
 It's all good. 
 Thank you. 
 (SOUND OF PHOTOCOPY MACHINE, RINGING PHONES) 
 ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP SOFTLY) 
 Susan, you didn't happen to see who put this on my desk, did you? 
 What is it? 
 Just a copy of an XHP affidavit. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Did you see who dropped this off for me? 
 No. 
 Was it a messenger? 
 Check the log. 
 Kirkland and Allen. 
 Sure, and how can I direct your call? Okay, please hold. 
 (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR OPENING) 
 Kirkland and Allen. 
 ♪ (THEME MUSIC GROWS STRONGER) 
 ♪ (THEME MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY) 
 It's already been scanned. 
 How's your dad? 
 Oh, you know, it is what it is. 
 I tried that sushi place you showed me on North Broadway. 
 Mmm. 
 There's Wright. 
 The fact that he's here is 50% of our battle. 
 Glad you could make it. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Sure. 
 What are you drinking? 
 Scotch. 
 Same as me. 
 I'm sure you know why we asked you here. 
 We would very much like to continue our relationship with both yourself and XHP. 
 Well, can we talk results? 
 'Cause we're in legal limbo and I just can't... 
 I love to talk results. 
 I can't justify what you call "a series of mistrials" with a deal I'm pretty sure I could pull off with my eyes closed. 
 I understand. 
 But these cases take time, Emery. 
 Mistrials are a hazard of our trade. 
 It may happen 10 or 15 more times before we get the verdict we want. 
 I know it feels like you're being put through the wringer. 
 I am being put through the f*cking wringer! 
 I can't believe I'm having to explain this to you, the lawyers we pay to solve this! 
 XHP is now projecting negative $300 million for this year. 
 Look, if you're gonna do a sales pitch, tell me how XHP wins. 
 It's clear you guys get paid whether we profit or not. 
 What is Akers offering you? 
 You know I can't discuss that. 
 Of course. 
 What if we could commit to three months for free, to get you back on our team? 
 I'd have to send it upstairs. 
 Six months. 
 Work with us. 
 Neil Akers is an excellent litigator, but moving your business to a new firm will cause a whole new series of setbacks. 
 How much will it cost you to get them up to speed? 
 (SOUND OF ELEVATOR CLOSING, FOOTSTEPS) 
 (SOUND OF DIGITAL DOOR KEY, FRONT DOOR OPENING) 
 Real sweet couple. 
 Can't thank them enough. 
 They own a chain of liquor stores and keep coming back to me to broker. 
 And now with this hotel they want to buy, it would really put me... on the next level. 
 And it would mean that you and I... 
 What would it mean? 
 I'm just so happy to see you! 
 I'm happy to see you, too. 
 There are things I want to tell you. 
 I- I shouldn't... 
 You can tell me. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 I know I don't know you well, but I feel like I do. 
 Your eyes... are so honest. 
 I know-I-I know that sounded like a-like a line but... 
 I can't get you out of my head. 
 And I don't want to. 
 That's sweet. 
 You don't have to say that. 
 I know I don't have to say that. 
 So many things I wanna tell you. 
 Just tell me. 
 (SOUND OF CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Hey Abby, I'm late for class. Can I call you back? 
 Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I'm coming to town. 
 When? 
 Tomorrow. 
 Tomorrow? What time? 
 I'm not sure yet, I'll probably get in around three. 
 Okay, okay... okay, I love you, bye. 
 (SOUND OF HURRIED FOOTSTEPS) 
 sh1t! 
 Sorry, I got stuck in traffic. 
 Is there any way I can make up the test? 
 I'm afraid not. 
 You have ten minutes. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Now I'm paying you to get me proprietary information. 
 What part of that isn't f*cking clear? 
 Get me some useful information. 
 Hi. 
 You alright? 
 Yeah... I got screwed. 
 I need to shake it off. 
 Wanna get drunk? 
 Sure. 
 He got fed the wrong information. 
 His source f*cked him. 
 I told him not to bite. 
 Twenty million gone 'cause he got sloppy. 
 How long have you been partners? 
 Too f*cking long! 
 Promise... 
 I won't talk about it anymore. 
 I like hearing you talk about it. 
 It's good for you to talk about it. 
 I like talking to you about it. 
 I like you, Chelsea. 
 I like you, too, Ryan. 
 Where're you really from? 
 Just outside of Philly. 
 Both my parents are teachers. 
 My mom teaches 5th grade English, and my dad teaches math in high school. 
 What do you like to do? 
 Be alone. 
 (SOUND OF RYAN LAUGHING) 
 You want to get married? 
 I don't believe in marriage. 
 Do you want kids? 
 No... 
 Hands down, no. 
 What do you want? 
 I'm studying law. 
 I believe that. 
 I won't ask what kind. 
 Patent. 
 Are your siblings as smart as you? 
 No. 
 My brother's great, though. 
 Just the two of you? 
 Yep, just one brother. 
 You're so smart... and I'm so selfish. 
 I'm leaving Jacqueline. 
 Just tell me where to send the money. 
 Take off your clothes.
