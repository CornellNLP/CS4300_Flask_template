 Felipe, where are they? 
 Right over there. 
 I mean, what could I do? 
 I pay for the coffee. 
 I pick up the dog, and I tell the cop that I'm with animal control, undercover. 
 I still have the dog. 
 [Laughter] 
 A million dollars? 
 Heck yeah, we got a deal.

 Hank Cramblin, what a legend. 
 How is your father? 
 He went insane. He lives in a nuthouse now. 
 Oh. 
 Well, the next time you see him, you tell him Sally Pomerantz from Chicago said hello. 
 He won't understand that. 
 Talking to him is like talking to Bugs Bunny. 
 Well, then you tell him, "What's up, doc?" 
 Thank you. 
 That'll mean a lot to him. 
 Sally Pomerantz. 
 Just as lovely as I'd always imagined. 
 I mean, wrong color but... just as lovely. 
 Yeah, he imagines everyone black. 
 I suppose it's because I'm black. 
 Oh, that could be. 
 Could be. 
 That could... 
 Could... 
 Both : Be. 
 Carter, we are on our way out because we already ate here. 
 Look at these stains on our ties. 
 Look at the receipt. 
 I'm guessing all the agencies are in town because you're hearing pitches for your new campaign. 
 Well, Cramblin would love to throw our hat in the ring on that. 
 Oh.

 But, you know, I'm just not sure that your firm is what we're looking for right now, gentlemen. 
 Oh, sure, 'cause you're probably gonna go with these fine folks from Chicago 'cause that's where you make your cars. 
 Wait a minute. No, you don't. 
 Where do they make their cars, Sam? 
 Right here in Detroit. 
 Come on, Carter.

Open on dad driving through the rain in a brand-new Chrysler 300. Across town, his daughter walks into a tattoo parlor. Hands a pile of cash to the man at the counter. Biker-type dude, like, a real mean guy, like, a neo-nazi. Yeah, she points to the sign that says "nipple piercing," takes off her shirt, pulls down her bra. We see everything. Yes. Cut to... Dad races across town. Close-up. Biker's meaty, hairy hand grabs the daughter's nipple. Pulls it out as far as it'll go. Oh, it's farther than you think. Yeah, it's way farther, man. Biker pierces the nipple. Daughter moans. Drop of red blood rolls down her milky black breast. No, milky white breast. I pictured black. Keep going. In the reflection, the drop of blood rolling down the daughter's breast, we see the father standing in the window. He sighs. He smiles. Says, "my baby's all growed up." "Got to let her fly." Chrysler. Time to fly. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! You know, the more I think about it, I don't think we can show a boob in a commercial. No. No, we can't. They wouldn't let us air that nursing home commercial with a boob in it. And that was just an accident. Hey, Judy? Two more beers. You got it. Two beers. Hot or cold? Well, cold. Come on, man.

Thank you, Judy. Thanks, Judy. You want a doggie bag for your beers? What are you talking about? That's a dumb idea. [Smooth rock music] ♪ ♪ We're dead. Eddie's gonna kill us, and we have got nothing on this Chrysler pitch. We'll come up with something. No, we won't, man. We're dumb. Hey. Hey.

It'll just be like a piece of bag out there. Nobody's gonna ask anything. No, I know. He's not answering. I'm so sorry. He has never missed a meeting like this. It's fine. Just very unprofessional. Let me call his cell phone. Call his cell phone? What are you gonna call it? What? You have to do stand-up. I will, I promise. That's weird. Someone's coming out of the woods with a bag of chips on their head. You know, that is weird. [People murmuring] That's Carter Grant! Oh, my god! Did you see that guy? [People gasp] Is he dead? Call 911! Hold his head! Hold his head! Over there! [Laughter] I still have that dog. Oh! [Laughs] Hey, Carter. Hey. Hey! Remember us? Like, when's the last time you remember seeing us? At... at the steak house. Yes, because that's the last place we saw you. Great. We... we just... We brought you these. Oh. Thank you. We just want to say... Yeah. You know, get well. Feel better. Thanks. And, uh, also, you know, we've got a great pitch for you, when you're ready to hear it. Ah. I'm sorry, guys. I really appreciate you coming down here, but, um, we ended up going with Pomerantz and Klein. What? Why didn't you wait until you heard our pitch? Honestly, I only scheduled that meeting out of respect for your father. Well, we'd still love for you to hear the pitch. Who knows? You may reconsider. Well, fellas, with all due respect, you do late-night commercials for furniture stores. Don't you think Chrysler's a little bit out of your league? You know? [Laughter] Excuse me? Out of our league? Oh, man! Well, yeah, right? Now you're definitely gonna hear the pitch. No, I'm not. Yes, you are gonna hear the pitch. We worked the pitch, and you're gonna hear it. You're not gonna pitch to me in a hospital! Uh-huh. Open on... Both : Joe Louis's fist. Mm-mm. No, no, no, no, no. We see an auto worker driving through town, looking at the sights he knows. The people, the places. His friends, his dad. I'm not listening. Mm-mm. No, you know what? He's not listening. He doesn't want to hear it. Very well, I'm pulling the plug on your ass. Do it! Kill him! Wait! Say good night, pal! Bye! I'm not on life support, you idiot! Why idiot? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? [Stammering] Let's just all calm down here a little bit, okay? I'm sorry. Okay, we're all sorry. Best of luck, guys. It's nothing personal. It's just business. It's just business. We understand. Just business. Okay? And this is e-business we're in. Yes. For sure. Yes. Every Chrysler is like the city of Detroit on four wheels. Come on, man. And this is the top, top of the bottom line. Now, this one... This one's a three-seater. It's not virgin plastic, so it's made from other stuff. This could be a bottle... Can you excuse me for one second? Eddie, we are so sorry. Boys, I got to tell you, when that commercial aired, wife and I went at it pretty bad. I mean, I had my bags packed. I was out the door. And we decided, you know, "let's just make love one last time." For the first time ever, we tried woman on top. It was amazing. Then we tried it again, woman on top. Wasn't a fluke. I was able to last longer. It was like I was able to stall while she got what she needed. And then, when she was done, I flipped her over, and I went real fast, so I got what I needed. That's great, Eddie. Very cool, very cool. Spent the rest of the night in the hot tub, just laughing and talking. I found out her favorite show is "Scandal." I didn't know that. I love "Scandal." Oh! That night, I remembered I was married to my best friend. We thought you were gonna be mad. Mad? Your commercial saved my marriage. [Bright music] Great.
