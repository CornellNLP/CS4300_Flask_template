I'm looking for a good time. Well... you found one. [chuckles] [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Cock-a-doodle-doo! [birds chirping] Hey. That was good. Yeah. So... until the next time. [funky music] I mean, well, there's got to be a lot of reasons why she'd leave $300 on my nightstand. Sure, maybe she broke something and she wanted to pay for it. Morning hot dogs for Sam and hot dogs benedict for my lady. Thank you, babe. Well, she did rip my Superman underwear when she took them off. Well, there you go. But if that's true, she wildly overvalued them. Not if you account for sentimental value. You loved those. I did love those. You did. Well, that's it. Both : That's it. We figured it out. That's easy. That's actually pretty easy. That's one of our best mysteries. No. Sam, she thinks you're a whore. Chrissy! Why would she need a prostitute? She's amazing. Hold on.

Now, where's the remote? Rachel's giving a press conference, and she said she's gonna work my name into her speech. I would like to assure the people of Detroit that I have done no wrong. And at the Sam time... Psh, barely. I'm sorry, at the same time, I would also like to apologize to Speaker Roberts for... calling him a minion. [laughter] Any questions? Look at him. [reporters clamoring] Over here. Right here, right here, right here. Councilwoman, I have a question for you. Hey. Hey, babe. How are you? I'm good. How was your day? Anything happen? You know Cheryl who works on the line next to me? Of course. Turns out she was an undercover boss. No sh1t. Yeah, fake hair, fake nose, everything. She's, like, the CEO of Chrysler. Wow. Yeah. How was your day? Sam's a full-on prostitute now. Yeah, monochrome suit, earring, the whole nine yards. What an idiot. Such an idiot, getting all dressed up, having drinks at fancy hotels. Then going upstairs for dirty, meaningless s*x with no strings attached. Monochrome suits, earring, the whole nine yards. No names, just sweat and bodies. Monochrome suit. [scoffs] What do you want for dinner? Milk and cheese, please. You can't have dairy. Pizza. [both laughing] [both sigh] I got you something. It's a Pandora bracelet. 'Cause, you know, that's the nature of our relationship. We both give each other things, you know. Yup, this one's a heart, you know, for obvious reasons. This one's an owl because you finished college. And this one's a soccer ball because it's rad. I'm sorry. Sam, did I misinterpret something? What do you mean? [mumbling] Are you a prostitute? What? [mumbling] Are you a prostitute? I'm sorry, one more time. [whispering] Are you sure you're a prostitute? M-me? Of course I'm a prostitute, all right? Just checking. Good. Good night, Sam, or whatever your real name is. It's Sam. From the lady. I don't want it. Hey, wait... I'm a fricking whore. 
 
 [dance music] ♪ ♪ Sam. What is the meaning of this? "Get satisfied today by Sam 'The Man' Duvet"? Tim, she pressed me about really being a prostitute; I freaked out. You know, I thought I got to create a paper trail. This is offensive. Tim, I'm not actually a prostitute. No, I'm offended you didn't come to me to produce this ad. I could have done so much with you. Can't even see your nipples. How's it doing? Not bad. A lot of texts, mostly wang pics. The real mistake was using my actual phone number. Oh, sure, yeah. [cell phone chimes] Oh, come on. Oh! Tim, you think this is all worth it? Do you think she really likes me? No, man. I think she thinks you're a fricking prostitute. Yeah, but I really, really like her, and, you know, maybe if I keep this up long enough, she'll discover that she really, really likes me too. [chuckles] Like in "She's All That"? Exactly like in "She's All That." I have a delivery from Councilwoman Gwinnett for Sam Duvet? Councilwoman Gwinnett would like to see you at the charity event tonight at the Detroit Institute of Arts. She'd like you to wear this. [soft guitar music] ♪ ♪ Tim, a tuxedo, a charity event, a museum? Mm. Tim, tonight might be the night. You did it. You "She's All That'd" her. I sure did. [lounge music playing] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] Change in plans. I need you to get out of here. Get out of here? Yes. And who is that? Is that another pro? Does he have an ad in the paper? Because I do. That's my husband. Husband? Yes. You're married? Sam, would you keep your voice down? I will not keep my voice down! Okay, Sam, you need to pull it together. I mean, what am I to you? A man that I pay for s*x. Yeah, but when we met, didn't you feel a connection? No, not really. You were at the Jefferson Hotel. You were holding a single rose. That's the signal for a honey boy open for business. So that's all I am to you, huh? Just some honey boy, huh? [loudly, voice echoing] That's all I am, just some big dick for money, huh? Is that it? Just a veiny wang with a knot at the end and two huge, pendulum balls? Is that all I am, huh? Yeah, just a guy with a Joe Louis fist in his pants and a freshly bleached butthole you could eat off of? Mwah! Mama mia. Is that it? Well, Rachel, this huge, honking pecker is attached to a body, and that body has a heart and a soul and a brain and arms, feet, neck, and... and... and... and... and... Sam. Yeah, I know. I lost the thread there. What was I s... And just a huge pecker! [slow R&B music playing] ♪ ♪ From the lady. ♪ ♪ Thanks for the drink. I'm looking for a date tonight. That's gonna cost you. [chuckles] How much? $1 million. A million dollars? Worth every penny. No, thanks. What do you mean, "No, thanks"? We're pretending. What's it matter? A million dollars? It's pretend money. Okay, what does a million dollars get me? [chuckles] Salad tossing, to completion. [laughs] $500,000. Ooh! Fine, I'll do it, but my pimp's gonna kill me. Say, pretty boy, what's your name? Sam Duvet. Ugh, Tim, that's nasty. You could pick any name in the world, and you pick my brother's? My name is... Chrissy Cramblin. That's my name. I'm not good at making up names. Just come on. My name? Bubba Sparxxx. [slow rock music playing] ♪ ♪ Hey, pal. You all right? I don't want to talk about it. Scandal rocks local government as Councilwoman Rachel Gwinnett was caught using city funds to buy the services of a local male prostitute. Oh, no. My parents are gonna see this. Don't worry. They won't know it's you. The honey boy in question, Sam "The Man" Duvet, was confirmed to be a prostitute thanks to the following unreleased ad. Are you a party girl? I can dance all night, baby. [dance music] Touching. Licking. Butts. [yells] ♪ ♪ Orgasmic. Well, how'd they get that? I sent it in. It's the best thing we've ever done, Sam. We now go live to Councilwoman Gwinnett's press conference. Once again, I apologize to the city of Detroit. I've let you down. I should have never consorted with that bimbo. And the worst thing is, he wasn't all that good. Oh, well, she's lying about that. Sure, I know. He wasn't all that good. And he had an aggressively medium wang. She's lying! She's a liar. Next up, Red Wings fans have something to cheer about, as they recover two frozen bodies from the ice. See those girls playing pool? One of them was looking at you. Come on, I'll introduce you. No way. Oh, don't be nervous. I'm not nervous, Tim. You're just a terrible wingman. Fine, I'll just stay here. You go on over there. I'm just some guy at the bar who doesn't even know you, doesn't love you. Go on, buddy. Thanks, buddy. Yeah. [slow bluesy rock music] I got next. Well, that means you'll be playing me. Oh, does it? Mm-hmm. I'm Sam. Vickie. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sorry, ladies. Don't. I don't know this guy. But I want to say... Why would you touch me? He seems like a great guy, the kind of guy you'd be proud to bring home to your parents. Just thought I'd drop by and say that. I'll get out of your way. ♪ ♪ [both laugh] That was weird. Right? Well, he's not wrong. Oh, really? Yeah. Mm! So you playing eight ball? Yeah. I'm sorry. I just realized that last interaction may have come across a little weird. That's because I forgot to introduce myself. My name's Mike Cyclops. I work for NASA. NASA? And let me just tell you, there is a lot they're not telling you, man. Trust me. I worked security at Area 51. Got kicked out for banging one of the aliens. She was hot too. She, he, it... It had everything, and I love that. Oh, God, I miss her. I really do. ♪ ♪ Uh... [laughs] Uh, so what... I'm sorry. Oh, for [bleep]... I lied. I do know him. I was his Uber driver. I just wanted to come over here and tell you that, in case you felt that there was an undeniable preexisting chemistry. Yeah, I'm an Uber driver. It's actually pretty fun. It can be fun. Yeah, all right. Yeah, great. ♪ ♪ So... Two fricking stars? Are you kidding me? After you farted in my car? Tim! Didn't even roll down the window. Ew! Tim, why are you doing this? I don't know. I think, deep down, I want to sabotage your relationships so I can have you all to myself. He's a piece of sh1t. Uh... So, uh, Veronica... Vickie. Vickie. Whatever. Vickie, yeah. I couldn't help but notice you were watching me, checking me out from over at the bar. Yeah, you're that prostitute from the news, right? [laughing] I was never really a prostitute. Let's make that clear. She just paid me for s*x. [yells]
