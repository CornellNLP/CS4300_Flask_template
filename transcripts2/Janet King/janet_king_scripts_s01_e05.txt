 It's not an offer. I still have to go through an interview. 
 Yeah! Wednesday the 30th. 
 I know. I saw the email. 
 You read my private messages? 
 You told me to look in your mail. 
 You didn't have to read them. 
 You didn't have to have... 
 You have to control everything! 
 How do you find the defendant, Dianne Vasilich? 
 Guilty. 
 My client is an innocent woman. 
 She and her son have been imprisoned for a crime they did not commit. 
 Janet King's gung-ho approach in this trial has caused a serious miscarriage of justice. 
 A bushwalker just found Steven Blakely's body. 
 Who buried him? 
 I have no idea. 
 You find us this third man or Dianne and her son will walk. 
 Steven Blakely was murdered and buried with a cricket bat, which Mr Cranford would have known if he'd buried him, which he most clearly did not. 
 Mr Moreno, I find you not guilty. 
 You are free to go. 
 Blakely's murder was just a small part of it. 
 If you want to sort this mess, ask yourself - how did Alex Moreno manage to get acquitted? 
 Tim Clarke, my child p0rn man. 
 You get f*ck away from her! 
 Get the f*ck away! 
 What the hell? 
 That's what you did in Adelaide. 
 You're a filthy f*cking rapist. 
 You're nuts, woman. 
 I'll look after you. 
 Who is she? 
 Touch her and I'll kill you. 
 You forced her into your car. 
 I saw you. 
 Leave my dad alone. 
 ♪ Theme music I tried to talk him out of charging you. ♪ 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Lots of witnesses, apparently. 
 Yeah. 
 And the jerk is playing the victim for all he's worth. 
 There was a moment, when I was... when I was watching him with the girl, just a... just a second... where I thought about letting him go... letting him do whatever he was going to do to her... just so there'd be something... 
 Just so there'd be something concrete against him. 
 You shouldn't have been anywhere near him. 
 That's so much better than fighting. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I know it's late. 
 Let me guess - fraud. 
 Child pornographer. 
 The criminals aren't the only ones who need your attention. 
 I've missed something. I don't know what, but I've missed something. 
 Find it in the morning. 
 It's serious. 
 It's always serious. 
 No, this is serious. 
 You're not a cop. Solving Blakely's murder is not your responsibility. 
 I know that look. 
 Another half hour. 
 A girl could die waiting. 
 Please? 
 (Baby cries) 
 We had our chance. 
 Tony : They're fast-tracking the Vasilich appeal. 
 Just been served the defence submission - public interest and all that crap. 
 First we had to hurry up and prosecute her because of the bloody supersensitive public, now we have to unprosecute her even faster. 
 sh1t. 
 It plays right into the AG's hands. 
 Another nail in the coffin of jury trials. 
 Let the Court of Criminal Appeal sort out another mess juries have got us into. 
 It's all our fault of course because we're too bloody good at our jobs. 
 That's how they'll spin it. 
 Can I put my bags down first? 
 No, I want you in as much of a lather as I am. 
 Fast-tracking means it's right on top of us. 
 We need to look at Judge Renmark's decisions over the last few years as a matter of urgency. 
 Can't we just focus on one crisis at a time? Is Renmark a crisis? 
 Forget about the Moreno case. 
 Danny Novak was messing with your mind. 
 Why would he bother? 
 Other than he's a murdering arsehole, no idea. 
 Your place or mine? 
 Yours. Just give me five. Erin? 
 Pull Judge Renmark's decisions over the last two years. 
 What, why? 
 Something was dodgy in Moreno. 
 What do you think? 
 Congratulations on your promotion. 
 I wish I didn't have to wait to be a Crown before I get to wear all this. 
 Appearing in a suit doesn't feel like such a big deal. 
 Being promoted to a solicitor advocate is a big deal. 
 Now I'm starting to feel a bit nervous. 
 Good - you're taking it seriously. 
 It's a training position. 
 You'll only be given simpler matters to start with. 
 Like the simple matters thrown at me when I first joined the DPP? 
 It's what you wanted, remember that. 
 You applied for it. You'll be fine. 
 Thank you for all your help. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 Yes, you did. 
 You know you did. I'll never be able to thank you enough. 
 You can get me another cup of tea as I prepare myself for the Dianne Vasilich appeal. 
 They're pretty gross, eh? 
 I didn't get your message till this morning. 
 I'm so sorry. What happened? 
 I wanted to kill him. 
 I don't blame you. 
 No, I really wanted to kill him. 
 Tony's going to hit the roof. 
 He's not having a good morning. 
 A cup of tea for me. 
 Very thoughtful. 
 You're out of luck. 
 This one's for Janet. 
 Wouldn't want to steal anything of Janet's. 
 Best not. Talk to you later. 
 Very close those two, aren't they? 
 Erin helped deliver Janet's twins. 
 There's a whole lot of images I wasn't expecting this morning. 
 By the way, congratulations on the Dirty Harry act. 
 Word travels fast. 
 We're jealous. You did the one thing none of us had the guts to do. 
 Lina, it's going to be fine. 
 You'll get a slap on the wrist and both sides of the bar table lining up to buy you a drink. 
 Oh, and you'll have to undergo months of compulsory counselling. 
 I could lose my job. 
 Now, there is the upside. 
 I'm the obvious person to run it. 
 You think Dianne Vasilich is guilty? 
 That's not relevant if I think we got it wrong. 
 What's this, a self-flagellation thing, is it? 
 A mistake is made, you want to take the rap, restore your reputation? 
 This has nothing to do with pride. 
 Yes, it does. Pride, ego, face - call it what you will. 
 You're not following due process. 
 Trial lawyers never run appeals. 
 That's why we have an appellate section full of weirdy geeks who get off on academic fine points. 
 I know this case. 
 There won't be time for anyone to get their head around it. 
 It's loaded, you know that. 
 It has been from the start. 
 All the more reason for one of the whisperers to have carriage of it. 
 Then if there's a lynch mob, they can deal with it. 
 You're happy for one of them to be cannon fodder? 
 Jesus, do you have to argue with everything? 
 I'm trying to protect you. 
 I'm a grown-up, Tony. 
 I don't need your protection. 
 I need those judgements of Renmark's on my desk in half an hour. 
 Sure. 
 And whatever you've got on the Vasilich appeal. 
 You want me to instruct one of the whisperers? 
 You'll be instructing me, whatever Tony says. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 An unexpected pleasure. 
 I've been going over the Alex Moreno case. 
 Waste of time. The judge got it wrong. Happens all the time. 
 A judge who's known to be pro-police? 
 He might have had a fight with his wife or a bourbon with breakfast. 
 He might have an undiagnosed brain tumour. Who knows? 
 Judges are just another variable we deal with every day. It's done. 
 We move on to the next catastrophe. 
 Just like that? 
 What's the alternative? 
 There wasn't anything about the case itself, Moreno, that was out of the ordinary? 
 I'd really like to help you with your conspiracy theory, but I was there, watching Caroline, the informant, asking myself, 'Does she make a good witness? How does she handle the courtroom?' 
 If we're going to use cops to trap paedophiles this way, I'd like to know I've got the right people in the job. 
 I like to do this with all my undercover people. 
 You might call me a control freak. 
 I just want to make sure that the resources are productively utilised. 
 What are you wasting your time for? 
 I thought you guys were up to your eyeballs. 
 I'm a control freak too. 
 Why don't you put that energy into keeping Dianne Vasilich in prison? 
 She murdered a good friend of mine. 
 Thanks for the coffee. 
 Child : Please! I just want to go outside. 
 Don't! 
 I don't like it. 
 It makes me feel funny. 
 I don't like this game. 
 Sorry. Can I disturb you for a moment? 
 I heard about you being charged. 
 Seems like everyone has. 
 Maybe this unit isn't right for you, Lina. 
 I could talk to Tony on your behalf. 
 I can talk to Tony by myself. 
 I thought you wouldn't mind if it came from someone else. 
 I saw the email about the solicitor advocate position. 
 You've organised Erin's career, and now it's my turn? 
 You're not still working on Clarke, are you? 
 Until Tony tells me not to. 
 Tony's got his hands full with the Vasilich appeal. 
 You know you can't work on this if you've assaulted the defendant. 
 Are these photos from... 
 From a Russian website, yeah. 
 This is Ruby Moreno. 
 Her father was the child groomer, the one Renmark acquitted. 
 The photographer? 
 Are you sure? 
 I saw her in court. 
 She was there with her mother. 
 It's not Moreno's house. 
 You sure? 
 It's not his home. 
 He lives in one of those open, warehousy-type places. 
 Inner city, very groovy. 
 Do you know if he owns any other houses? 
 Not that we could find. 
 Nothing in his or his wife's name. 
 This changes everything. I'd love to have another go at the creep. 
 Thanks for bringing it to my attention. 
 Will you bring Moreno in? 
 No point, we'd just tip him off, but I'm happy to put him under surveillance. 
 I'll find out about his daughter and her friends. They might be involved. 
 Do we have a date of birth for her? 
 In this photo she could be 12, or 17, 18. 
 I can find out. 
 She's 14 or 15, from memory. 
 Prove she's under 16 and we get Clarke. 
 Was there anything else about Moreno that didn't make it to the brief, something you suspected but couldn't prove? 
 He's a creep who takes pornographic photos of children, including maybe his own daughter. 
 What else did you have in mind? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 We should stop meeting like this. 
 People will talk. 
 My office has received an application for a pardon for Dianne Vasilich. 
 What? They haven't even started the bloody appeal yet. 
 I asked you to sort this out. 
 We did. She was convicted, if memory serves. 
 I don't want anyone to think this government has locked up an innocent person. Shut it down. 
 You're the number-one prosecutor in this State. 
 I want you to run this appeal and win it. 
 That's a specialist job. 
 I don't want to read that pardon petition. 
 It'd be a dangerous precedent. 
 We need this conviction to stand. 
 Of course. 
 I'll have a word to the Chief Justice, see if we can organise something about the bench. 
 You're starting Vasilich without me. 
 I asked him to look at it. 
 I know the case, Tony. I have time. 
 You want the good news or the bad news? 
 The good news is, our esteemed Attorney-General cares so much about us, she wants to know about every single thing that comes across our desk. 
 She wants to be involved. 
 Warms the cockles, doesn't it? 
 The bad news is she's dragging you off the field and sacrificing me to Their Honours of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
 That's ridiculous. 
 You can't run this case. 
 Thanks for the vote of confidence. 
 Sorry. I meant, as Director of Public Prosecutions. 
 No, you're right, I can't run it. 
 But as I've discovered, as DPP, I have even less power than I had before. 
 I'm nothing more than the AG's factotum, a word that sadly sounds ruder than it actually is. 
 So, I'll start with these and meet you in hell. 
 The Renmark judgements are all on your desk, the last two years, plus an article he wrote for the Law Journal and a paper he delivered last November at the Australasian Convention of Jurists. 
 Thanks. I'd better get on with this for Tony. 
 Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Bloody HR are leaning on me to take some of my 300 years' accumulated leave. 
 I get a call like that every two weeks. 
 This time they're not taking no for an answer. 
 Bullshit. Now? 
 They want you to step up and run my patch. 
 What about the Blakely case? 
 I'm running the investigation of the biggest shitstorm this department's seen in years. 
 I tried to suggest somebody else, but they wouldn't budge. 
 You're free to take on the High Commissioner. 
 We have this Cranford scumbag right in front of us. 
 He knows who was involved. 
 We've got to keep leaning on him. 
 Don't worry. The task force continues, just without you. 
 Who are they bringing in? 
 A guy called Ramesh Nahar. 
 I don't know him. 
 Apparently quite thorough. 
 I feel so much better now. 
 Has he ever handled a homicide? 
 Perfect. 
 It's not all that bad. 
 Means they've got their eye on you. 
 The timing's sh1t, but ultimately, it's great for your career. 
 You ready to start the handover? 
 Thought you might give me a lift home. 
 I could do that. 
 They've pulled me off the task force. 
 I have to mind the fort for Jack Rizzoli for a couple of weeks. 
 They've promoted you? 
 It's babysitting. 
 The guy they've brought in to do my job, Ramesh Nahar, spent all day reading. 
 Wants to see every piece of everything before he makes a move. 
 We could all be dead by then. 
 That does mean you've gone up a rung. 
 It means that they've taken me off Blakely. 
 What's the obsession with promotion? 
 Having a criminal wife hasn't affected your career. 
 I'm not shitty with you. 
 You've hardly spoken to me. 
 I've hardly been around! 
 You haven't really been around since Blakely died. 
 You know why I don't like vigilantes? 
 Other than the total breakdown of society? 
 Because they can get it wrong. 
 They can get themselves killed. 
 What if that scumbag Clarke suddenly hit back at you, really lost it? 
 There were a lot of people around. 
 What if there weren't? 
 What if he had a knife? 
 Leave that stuff to us. 
 So you can get knifed instead of me? 
 That would be my preference, yeah. 
 If Jack doesn't come back, will they keep you in his job, behind a desk? 
 I'd go crazy. 
 Better crazy than dead. 
 Ooh, bubbles. 
 Bubbles! 
 This is so much easier, with the two of us. 
 Yeah. 
 They look so cute together. 
 Hey, don't do that. 
 Do what? 
 Take a photo of them in the bath. 
 Relax. They look gorgeous. 
 Don't! 
 Got to have something embarrassing for their 21st. 
 You take photos, put them on the computer, we get hacked, who knows where they end up? 
 A couple of kids in the bath? 
 Yes, a couple of kids in the bath. 
 OK, fine. Point taken. 
 This is what I was talking about. 
 An innocent picture taken by a doting parent, or a still from a video in a Sydney house that ended up on a Russian p0rn site and was downloaded by a man in Homebush? 
 Oh, how terrible. 
 A beach house? 
 Well, she's wearing swimmers. 
 Dolphins on the wall. 
 People always decorate beach houses with beachy stuff. 
 It's weird - the beach is just out the window. 
 I can even tell you which beach, but I guess the cops already told you. 
 No, they haven't. 
 See here? 
 What? 
 There's a reflection. 
 The lighthouse. 
 I never noticed that. 
 I think it's Point Galloway. 
 We used to go to that part of the coast every January for years and years. 
 Whose house is this? 
 We're off. 
 Already? 
 Mothers' group likes to get to the cafe early, make sure we all get seats. 
 I'll let you know if I hear anything from St Bart's. 
 Fingers crossed. 
 You need a hand? 
 I'm fine. Do it all the time. 
 Ashleigh Larsson? 
 How long has Janet been sleeping with Erin O'Shaughnessy? 
 Did you know about this affair? 
 Did you know she organised a promotion for Erin at the DPP? 
 Janet? 
 She was on the selection committee. 
 Just get inside, Ash. 
 I'm happy to speak to you first. 
 You promoted your lover, Erin. 
 Would you describe this promotion as typical of the gay mafia operating within the DPP? 
 How dare you invade the privacy of my home? 
 Do all your lovers get promoted? 
 That is not why Miss O'Shaughnessy was promoted. 
 How does it feel, being responsible for jailing an innocent woman? 
 You're on private property. 
 Senior Crown Prosecutor Janet King today denied an improper relationship with DPP solicitor Erin O'Shaughnessy. 
 Miss King has further denied allegations of a gay mafia within the DPP, and that Miss O'Shaughnessy's recent promotion was based on anything other than merit. 
 Jesus, it's everywhere. 
 You could read about it on Mars. 
 There was only one reporter. 
 The rest of the world's caught up. 
 Gay mafia. 
 Just the kind of bullshit muckraking this department needs. 
 How did they know where I live, hmm? 
 (Phone rings) 
 No bloody comment. Is Ash alright? 
 No, not really. 
 She's stuck in with two kids, doesn't want to venture outside. 
 But the two of you... 
 You're asking me if she thinks I'm guilty? 
 I'm an insensitive baboon. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, if you want to go home... 
 I don't care if they hassle me about my work, but my family? 
 Just as well I'm the bunny in the headlights doing the Vasilich appeal, isn't it? 
 That's the golden lining, is it? 
 (Phone continues ringing) 
 Who would think that Janet and I... 
 Not me. I can vouch for you having screwed your way through half the male legal fraternity. 
 That doesn't help. 
 But for someone who doesn't know you as intimately as I do, you and Janet seem very close. 
 Friends. 
 I know. Friends. 
 You and I spend a lot of time together. 
 You and Janet hugged. 
 So have you and I! 
 But I'm not gay. 
 Because it's Janet, it's ridiculous to assume we're lovers. 
 Someone saw her take you into the conference room and close the door. 
 That's the type of thing we wouldn't do if we were having an affair. 
 I know, I know. I'm just trying to put myself in someone else's shoes. 
 Someone who's out to get me, or Janet. 
 Can you see how it might look from their perspective? 
 OK, so it might look suss. 
 That's one thing. 
 But ringing some current affairs show and spilling it to them? 
 Why would anyone do that, and which of those arseholes was it? 
 You and I are really in the sh1t now, aren't we? 
 I'm very sorry this has happened. 
 The gutter press can be so brutal. 
 Can I get you anything? 
 No, I'm fine, but thank you. 
 I don't blame you. 
 Erin is a beautiful girl, and she knows how to use it. 
 You're not the first to be caught in her net. 
 At least in your case, it's not adultery. 
 You have to be married to commit adultery, and you're not even really in a relationship, in the eyes of the Lord. 
 Lust can make fools of us all. 
 f*ck off, Tracey. 
 
 
 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Phone continues ringing) 
 Close the door. 
 Isn't that going to look suss? 
 Can you just close the door, please? 
 You alright? 
 Do you think it's Tracey? 
 Tracey? No, no. 
 She's as bigoted as they come, but she loves this place. 
 She'd never do anything to create adverse publicity. 
 Someone's happy to do it. I really think we should keep the door open. 
 Someone might have seen us. 
 The door's fine. 
 How's Ash? Is she OK? 
 She'll get there. 
 Would it help if I talked to her? 
 I don't think so. 
 She doesn't think there's anything going on? 
 Of course not. I can still come round, see you guys? 
 I think it's better if we just leave it for a bit. 
 Fair enough. 
 Just for a while. 
 For the Vasilich appeal, finding Blakely's body constitutes new evidence, evidence that was available or could have been found with due diligence. 
 As opposed to fresh evidence, which wasn't in existence at the time of the trial? 
 Correct. 
 If the police had done their job and found Blakely's body before charging Dianne Vasilich, we wouldn't be in this situation. 
 Possibly, but just because she didn't dispose of the body... 
 They're going to argue that this new evidence means this conviction was, one, unsafe or unsatisfactory, two, was wrong in law or three, constituted a miscarriage of justice. 
 You don't need me. 
 Not so fast. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 I'm not getting on the floor. 
 But these are part of the defence submissions. 
 I don't need a bloody map to tell me that Vasilich and her son couldn't bury Blakely. 
 Oh, for God's sake! 
 Of course. 
 What we want to argue for is a retrial, correct? 
 Definitely. 
 What do we need to argue to achieve that? 
 We need to show that there is no lurking doubt. 
 We need to show the conviction is safe, despite the new evidence. 
 Lurking doubt? 
 Lord Widgery, Crown and Cooper, 1969. 
 'On the basis of the general feel of the case as the court experiences it, there may remain a lurking doubt in the minds of the appellate judges which makes them wonder whether justice has been done.' 
 General feel? Crap. 
 They're not going to decide an appeal on feelings. 
 On the other hand, the High Court of Australia has stated that the question of reasonableness of a jury's verdict is a question of law and not of feel - the court's function is analytical, not instinctive. 
 If the High Court says that, why are we bothering with all this lurking doubt bullshit? 
 Because all judges, and lawyers, use intuition. 
 Any decision anyone makes is never purely analytical. 
 Emotion plays a huge part. 
 It's one of the things that's been proven in neural-plasticity studies. 
 The brain's wiring emphatically relies on emotion over intellect in decision-making. 
 You should have an affair with Janet. 
 She can get you promoted to the appellate section, and you could play with all the other little whisperers. 
 Let's not contradict the High Court in front of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Not this time, OK? 
 Just got to get my bulldog clip. 
 (Door opens) 
 I'm working in here today. 
 Yeah, Tracey said. 
 No distractions. 
 I'm sorry about what's happened. 
 Thank you. 
 And about giving you attitude over the Clarke stuff. 
 I was out of line. 
 I know you're just trying to help. 
 Has Tony given Clarke to anyone else yet? 
 I think he's avoiding me. 
 You still have prints of the photos from this website? 
 Boxes and boxes of them. 
 Could I borrow them this morning? 
 And the website address. 
 This photo was taken near the lighthouse in Point Galloway. 
 On the South Coast? 
 But I don't know which street, and I don't know who owns it. 
 If I find more photos featuring Ruby Moreno and this house, I may find a way to identify the exact location. 
 Caroline Martin and the police will be able to... 
 I haven't got time for that. 
 This house has to belong to Moreno. 
 The person who's hidden the camera needs constant access to change batteries. 
 That camera is taking video of naked children, and someone is selling those images to p0rn sites. 
 I know, but... 
 I'm not asking you to look at this yourself. 
 I know it's not appropriate, given what's happened. 
 There are tens of thousands of them. 
 That photo is just the beginning. 
 That's why I need to start now. 
 Can you just get me those boxes of photos, please? 
 I get more visitors here than in my office. 
 Have you got time to listen to an opening for Vasilich? 
 I'm refuting lurking doubt. 
 You're stalking Renmark? 
 We're drowning in work, and you're stalking Renmark? 
 Someone leaned on him. 
 No. 
 Danny Novak says someone leaned on him. 
 There's a big difference. 
 How else could he get Moreno so wrong? 
 Past his use-by date. 
 He's always been pro-prosecution, you know that. 
 This is an about-face overnight. 
 There's no such thing as overnight in the criminal justice system. 
 There's months between decisions. 
 Something's wrong. 
 Let it go. 
 No. Can't. 
 If there's any truth in this, Tony... 
 Look, you want it to be true because you think it takes the pressure off you. 
 Now, I know it's been difficult since you've been back. 
 'Disastrous,' isn't it, the word you're reaching for? 
 This is all going to blow over - 
 Blakely, Vasilich, this impropriety thing. 
 Some footballer's wife will get busted for shoplifting, then suddenly life will be peachy. 
 Peachy? 
 I've never used that word in my life. 
 (Knock at door) 
 You'll want to see this. 
 Following recent allegations in the press about Senior Crown Prosecutor Janet King, the Government has appointed recently retired Judge Granville Renmark to inquire into the functioning of the office of the DPP. 
 He'll be interviewing past and current staff of the Department of Public Prosecutions and anyone else he thinks relevant. 
 It is vital this state has a strong and effective prosecution service. 
 I've asked the Director of the DPP and his staff to give His Honour their full cooperation and assistance. 
 First I've heard of it. 
 Judge Renmark will report directly to Cabinet. 
 Would it help if I don't take the job? 
 You'll take the bloody job. 
 Renmark. Tell me that's a coincidence. 
 Of course Janet knows I want to be a Crown one day. 
 She's been a sort of unofficial mentor since I started at the DPP. 
 And Miss King was on the selection panel? 
 One of three, yes. 
 You see each other socially? 
 Yes. There's nothing wrong with that, is there? 
 When did you discover that you and Miss King shared the same... lifestyle choice? 
 Which particular choice are you referring to? 
 Our shared love of Tolstoy? 
 French films? The Sydney Swans? 
 Unfortunate when our private desires conflict with our public duties. 
 You were the one who proposed the creation of the position of solicitor advocate? 
 Yes. 
 And you created that position with Miss O'Shaughnessy in mind? 
 If you had any sort of relationship outside the office with an applicant, you should have stepped back. 
 As a Crown Prosecutor, you're held to the highest standards. 
 You must be unimpeachable, above reproach. 
 Just like a judge. 
 Yes, just like a judge. 
 I'd tread very carefully if I were you, Miss King. 
 Thank you for the warning, Judge Renmark. 
 Not that way. 
 There's a mob of reporters. 
 Thank you. 
 That beach house doesn't belong to Alex Moreno. 
 If I wasn't going to look at the Clarke photos, I needed to do something. 
 I tried to think like Richard. 
 I used the reflection of the lighthouse. 
 I measured the angles, narrowed the location down to a street, figured it must be one of the six houses on that street. 
 They could only be on one side of the street to catch the reflection. 
 I did a title search on all six. 
 And? 
 No.26 is owned by a company called Blue and White Holdings. 
 The director of that company is Steven Blakely. 
 Steve Blakely knew Moreno? 
 Must have. 
 I found dozens of photos of naked children taken in the same house. 
 The question is, did he know what Moreno was doing there? 
 There's an easy answer to that - no. 
 If Dianne didn't kill Blakely, we're looking for another murderer, another motive. 
 He found out what Moreno was doing and Moreno killed him? 
 Or they were in it together, they fell out, Moreno feared exposure... 
 Steve Blakely's producing p0rn? 
 It's possible. 
 It's also possible that every family that has stayed in this house has had photos taken of them without their knowledge. 
 Why are you looking at this? 
 Wild conjecture is my job. 
 I have found a link between Moreno and Blakely. 
 You don't want to think you prosecuted the wrong person. 
 That's not why. 
 What, then? 
 Intuition. 
 Bullshit. 
 You've got Moreno under surveillance. 
 Maybe you need to do more. 
 Like what? 
 I don't know. Something. 
 I'm not even on the task force right now. 
 Tell me who I need to talk to. 
 Alright. Talk to me, OK? 
 I want this sorted just as much as you do. 
 Fantastic views. 
 We've been renting it twice a year during school holidays for three, maybe four years now. 
 My daughter loves it. 
 You rent it through the owner? 
 Through an agent, a local outfit - 
 Dunphy's. 
 Is there a problem with the house? 
 Something happen? 
 Perfect place for taking photos. 
 You do work while you're there? 
 I don't even take a point-and-shoot. 
 Don't go in for the holiday-snap thing. 
 Video? 
 Never use it. 
 October the 9th. 
 What were you doing that night? 
 October? It was a fair while ago. 
 I'm not sure what I was doing. 
 No idea at all? 
 No, sorry. 
 You want to give it some thought? 
 OK. 
 October. Wednesday. 
 I could have driven down to Coogee, taken the dog for a walk. 
 I often do that midweek. 
 On your own? 
 No, I had the dog with me. 
 OK, so the real-estate agency checks out. 
 The Moreno family stay there twice a year, pay by credit card. 
 All above board. We still have him under surveillance. 
 So we just wait? 
 Welcome to my world. 
 Heard a rumour you might be interested in. 
 Apparently, Renmark volunteered himself for the inquiry. 
 Make of that what you will. 
 Someone in reception for you - 
 Maya and Drew Blakely. 
 Are they here to see Tony? 
 I don't think he's expecting them so soon. I don't think he's here. 
 I called them in early. 
 I want to explain why I won't be handling things. 
 Should I join you, explain the approach we're taking? 
 No need. The intricacies of an appeal will be lost on them. 
 I'll just reassure them. 
 Leave them with me. 
 We just get shunted to the next available lawyer, is that how this works? 
 I understand how you feel, but Tony is the most senior advocate we have at the DPP. 
 He's highly experienced at appearance work. 
 They know what they're doing. 
 Do the police know how Dad's body got to be out there? 
 No. 
 This woman might be declared innocent? 
 If her appeal is successful, it doesn't mean she's innocent. 
 It means the court doesn't think it was reasonable for the jury to convict her. 
 It turns on a question of doubt. 
 You don't doubt that she killed Dad, do you? 
 The only person who can ever know that without doubt is Dianne Vasilich. 
 I believe the jury did reach a reasonable verdict on the facts in front of them at the time. 
 She hated Dad. 
 There's no way she'll get off. 
 It's always a possibility, and you need to prepare yourselves for that. 
 Do either of you know if your father knew a photographer called Alex Moreno? 
 Not that I know. 
 Why do you ask? 
 Do you recognise that bedroom? 
 Yeah, that's our beach house. 
 The girl is Alex Moreno's daughter. 
 We believe the photo was taken with a hidden camera. 
 The police found the photo on a p0rn site. 
 Someone's making p0rn at our beach house? 
 Yes. 
 You think our father had something to do with this? 
 I don't know. 
 That house is with an agent. 
 We only get to use it a couple of times a year, in the off-season. 
 Whoever put the camera in needed constant, easy access to the house. 
 Did you ask the agent? Did you? 
 Why should the automatic assumption be my father had something to do with this? 
 It could be anyone. 
 Let's put it on the dead man. 
 He's not here to defend himself. 
 That makes things really neat and tidy for you, doesn't it? 
 Is that why you're not doing the appeal, because you think that my father is a child pornographer? 
 It might not be your father. It might be someone associated with him. 
 This is what we're trying to establish. 
 Maya? 
 I just think that we should just leave... we should just leave Dad out of this. 
 Maybe it was Dad. 
 He, um... 
 He got me to buy him a stack of security cameras through my IT company a couple of years ago. 
 I got him a trade discount, gave him the receipts. 
 I never asked what he wanted them for. 
 They could be for anything. 
 They could be for the police. 
 Yeah, yeah. I don't know. 
 Maybe it's cop-related. 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 What size were the cameras? 
 State-of-the-art, and small. 
 You'd never see them if you weren't looking for them. 
 You don't happen to have copies of the receipts for those, do you? 
 He was a police officer. 
 He was very security-conscious. 
 This doesn't prove anything. 
 Why can't you just shut up? 
 (Knock at door) 
 Janet. Thanks for explaining things. 
 Tony Gillies, Director of Public Prosecutions. 
 I believe you'll be joining us in court today. 
 I'm sure Janet's run through what to expect. Pretty dry stuff. 
 We shouldn't oppose the appeal. 
 What? 
 I'm sure now that Dianne Vasilich didn't kill Blakely. 
 Don't spring this sort of sh1t on me when I'm about to front up to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
 You know what the Chief Justice has done? He's stacked the bench. 
 Clearly, he's sick of all the media attention and political interference. 
 He wants to make it crystal-clear to the AG that she has to butt out. 
 I've got Jonathan MacLeod, a judge hell-bent on abolishing the jury system. 
 I've got Michael Manzarelli, who I turned down for a job as Crown and Bernie Lane, a former defence silk. 
 I mean, it's a total set-up. 
 So unless you've got video footage of Moreno with his hand on a bloody great shovel, I'm not going to play nicely with the other children. 
 In the matter of the appeals of Dianne Mary Vasilich and Brian Patrick Vincent against the Department of Public Prosecutions, an appeal against conviction. 
 If the court pleases, Gillian Warden. 
 I appear for the appellant. 
 Ms Warden. 
 Tony Gillies. I appear on behalf of the respondent. 
 Mr Gillies. No jury here for you to play to today, I'm afraid. 
 Your Honour. 
 Your Honours, I would like to speak to the submissions before the court on behalf of the appellants. 
 We've all read the submissions. 
 You're pushing at an open door, Ms Warden. 
 As Your Honour pleases. 
 Your Honour, in the submissions before the court... 
 If I could stop you there, Mr Gillies. Sorry, Your Honour. 
 Your submissions were very comprehensive. 
 There's no need for you to elaborate. 
 If I might, Your Honour, raise the issue... 
 We're in a position to rule on the appeal today. 
 We're ready to give our decision now and our written judgement will follow. 
 As Your Honours please. 
 Mrs Vasilich, Mr Vincent, if you could please stand. 
 Speaking on behalf of my brother judges, we have read the submissions prepared by counsel on your behalf, and we hereby allow the appeal. 
 In relation to one count of murder and of accessory after the fact of murder, we order the convictions be quashed and an acquittal be entered. 
 Loathe as I am to interrupt, if Your Honours are of a mind to allow the appeal, I wish to be heard on the merit of remitting the case for retrial to the Supreme Court. 
 We've already determined the matter, Mr Gillies. 
 You are free to go. 
 All rise. 
 f*ck it. 
 She paid Franzen to rough Blakely up. 
 I'm arresting her for conspiracy to murder. 
 We've got all the evidence we need for that. 
 It's a publicity nightmare. 
 Just let it go. Just drop it. 
 Well done. 
 There's some stuff that's been shot in Steve's beach house that's somehow found its way onto a Russian p0rn site. 
 sh1t. 
 Drew reckons Steve bought a couple of dozen tiny surveillance cameras through him. 
 The receipts check out. 
 I mean, these cameras are just perfect for spying on little kids without them knowing. 
 Don't you just hate it when all that work you've put in turns up something you just didn't want to find? 
 I'm afraid Janet King gets the prize for that bit of work. 
 She's wasted at DPP. Wasted. 
 Sometimes we see too much. 
 We get stressed out, our defences are down. 
 See these other guys making all this money, and we struggle to pay the mortgage. 
 Then we realise we've got easy access to whatever we want - money, drugs, p0rn, girls, kids. 
 I'm not offering excuses... I'm just trying to make sense of how it happens. 
 Steve's dead, and all this sh1t's floating up. 
 I don't know what to think anymore. 
 We never did. 
 Yeah, but Steve? 
 Now I... I don't... 
 f*ck. 
 I've got to piss. 
 What's your excuse for leaving so late? 
 I'm prey for the paparazzi because I'm a wild lesbian who's shagging her boss to get ahead. 
 If only they knew how tragic my love life really is. 
 About as tragic as a crazed solicitor attacking an innocent man at a railway station? 
 Any word about your job? 
 Too much else going on. 
 I suppose that's a good thing. 
 Is it? 
 Feels like I'm in limbo. 
 Do you know what you want to happen? 
 Other than Clarke getting locked away for life, I don't know. 
 I don't think I can keep going, not in that department. 
 That's the first time I've said that out loud. 
 You know, I really terrified myself. 
 I didn't think I had that in me. 
 I always suspected you were ferocious. 
 Anyone still out there? 
 Looks like lesbian s*x scandals aren't worth staying out all night for. 
 Anyway, we should be celebrating. 
 It's not every day you get a shiny new job. I am so proud of you. 
 I shouldn't be worried, should I? 
 Oh, God, no. 
 There's a new scandal every day. 
 Ash, of course not. 
 I know how flattering it is when someone young and gorgeous has a crush on you. 
 Erin doesn't have a crush on me. 
 You spend a lot more time with her than you do with me. 
 You seriously think I might do something like that? 
 I don't know. Don't make me the bad guy just for asking. 
 Well, I'm not the bad guy. 
 We're tired, and the kids... 
 This is not about being tired. 
 Maybe in some ways it is about being tired. 
 Let's face it, it hasn't exactly been a sex-fest around here lately. 
 I am not sleeping with Erin or anyone else. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I wish I'd never said anything. 
 Come here. 
 No, no. 
 Just don't. 
 Listen. 
 I would never do anything to jeopardise us. 
 You and the kids are my world... and you have me completely. 
 Yes? 
 Yeah. 
 Come here. 
 (Babies cry) 
 So much for the stroller theory. 
 Maybe we could put them in the car, drive them around a bit? 
 It's worth a try. Come on. 
 Let's take the beast. 
 Why don't we swing by the gelati place on the way out? 
 (Sirens) 
 Police over radio : We'll be moving them tonight to separate safe houses. 
 I thought I should make it easy for yuou. 
 A perfectly honourable course of action. 
 I don't trust myself anymore. 
 I've compiled a list of people who might hold a grudge against you. 
 I don't need this. I know who did it. 
 If I tell you the truth, no-one needs to know, do they? 
 Terry Renner's looking into the organised crime... 
 This has nothing to do with a drug dealer I put away five years ago. 
 You don't think it happened? 
 I don't know. 
 I didn't see it. 
 It happened! 
 Both our families are being attacked by someone. 
 I just don't know what his involvement is. 
 They nearly died because of me That's all that matters. 
 Resign now and go back to private practice.
