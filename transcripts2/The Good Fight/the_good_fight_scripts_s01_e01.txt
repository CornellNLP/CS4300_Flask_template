 I'm a lawyer. 
 Oh, babe. 
 (both laugh) 
 Oh, my God! 
 I'm a lawyer! (screams) 
 (whispering): I'm a lawyer. Oh, my God. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 ♪ Nostalgia sweet... ♪ 
 I'm resigning. 
 To go where? 
 Nowhere. 
 I'm retiring. 
 Howard : Oh, my God. 
 When? 
 Two weeks. 
 I don't want to leave you in the lurch. 
 So, I'll just, uh, finish out the Kendall case. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 We're top heavy. 
 Eight name partners. 
 I'm ready to live my life. 
 Write a memoir, take a deep breath. 
 Well... congratulations, Diane. 
 (applause) 
 Thank you, David. 
 Receptionist : Good morning. Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee, Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan, Tannebaum & Associates, how may I direct your call? 
 I heard they fire half of us in the first month. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard that, too. 
 We should stick together. 
 Uh, I'm Lili. 
 Maia. 
 Uh, pretty ring. What is it? 
 Oh, it's a rosary ring. 
 Are you religious? 
 No, no. 
 (sighs) Just nervous. 
 (both chuckle nervously) 
 Stand up! 
 Those seats are for clients. 
 Follow me and try to keep up. 
 (all murmuring) 
 Lockhart, Deckler, Lee is the result of a merger of three mid-sized firms. 
 We are now the largest civil litigator in the Midwest, and you are lucky to be here. 
 As new associates, you can be fired at any time, and many of you will be. 
 This is not lawyer camp. 
 We are not here to help you learn. 
 You are here to help us. 
 If a partner needs their dry-cleaning, treat it like a clerkship for Justice Kennedy. 
 Any questions? 
 This is a depo dump. 
 We need to know what is in every one of these 85,632 documents. 
 Come forward when I call your name. 
 Michael Baer. 
 Uh, where do I work? 
 David Yoo. 
 Lili Brenner. 
 Maia... 
 Maia Rindell? 
 How are you doing, Maia? 
 Good. 
 No, no, no, here, you take these. 
 Say hello to your parents for me, will you? 
 Sure. 
 Oh, by the way, this came for you this morning. 
 Burl Ferrand. 
 Rebecca Luzzatto. 
 Maia :  Mom. 
 Please don't send me anything else, okay? 
 Um, I appreciate it, you know I do, but, uh, it's making me look, um... 
 I don't know, entitled. 
 Are people not being nice to you, dear? 
 No, Mom, they're being great. 
 It's the attention. 
 You know, I want to just... blend in. 
 Do you want me to ask Diane to put you in your own office? 
 No, Mom, no, please, okay? 
 Are you sure? 
 Because we can call Diane. 
 No. Everything is fine. 
 All right, we got to go. 
 And, uh, I'll check in with Diane later. 
 No, Mom-Mom, it's okay. 
 Henry : Love you, sweetheart. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Receptionist :  Good morning. 
 Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee, Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan... 
 (receptionists talking over each other) 
 Enough with the lilies. 
 You know, some of us have allergies. 
 Oh, I'm actually a new associate here. 
 Good for you. 
 Just go tell your head florist... no more lilies. 
 Maia Rindell? 
 Maia. 
 How you doing? 
 Good. 
 (chuckles) Your first day as a lawyer. 
 Good. Mm. 
 Your parents called. 
 Oh, God, I told them not to. 
 No, it's all right. 
 They're worried you might be being ostracized. 
 Oh, they have got to stop. 
 Really... 
 It's okay. 
 There is an empty office downstairs that I can... 
 No, no, please. 
 Oh, come on, I-I don't want anything. come on... let your godmother spoil you a little bit. 
 Diane, please. 
 Oh, I have something for you. 
 This was given to me by Pearl Hart, the first female public defender in Chicago. 
 Now it's yours. 
 Seriously? 
 I'm retiring. You're starting. 
 It's fitting. Like a baton. 
 Now it's your turn to carry it. 
 Oh, I haven't done anything yet. 
 I hadn't, either. 
 This will force you to, okay? 
 Let's make the most of my two weeks left of mentoring. 
 Take notes on this deposition. 
 Afterwards, I'll ask you what you think we should offer as a settlement. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Lucca. 
 Ms. Lockhart. Hello. 
 I didn't know you joined Reddick and Boseman. 
 Four months ago. 
 Oh. 
 Alicia, too? 
 No, just me. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 Shall we get started here, or do we... 
 Diane, sorry I'm late. 
 Judge Monroe stopped me in the elevator. 
 How is everyone? 
 So, this is so confusing. 
 Which side am I on here? 
 Eeny... meeny... miny... 
 (laughs) 
 Okay. 
 Woman : Someone help! 
 (men grunting) 
 Leave him alone! 
 Man : Ow, I'm sick! 
 Woman : Leave him alone! 
 Man : I'm sick! Let me up! 
 Let me up... 
 You shot that video, didn't you, Mr. Hunter? 
 Yes. 
 Would you tell us what you saw? 
 I saw these cops tackling Toby. 
 And that would be Mr. Toby Kendall, the victim right here? 
 Objection as to "victim." 
 Really, Diane? 
 The gentleman's in a wheelchair; his parents have to feed him. 
 Now what do you want me to call him, um... 
 "happy participant"? 
 Diane : "Arreste" is good by me. 
 Adrian : No, you can preserve your objection for the record, but that right there is no "arrestee." 
 (video resumes, men grunting) 
 Woman : Stop! Stop! Stop it! 
 Stop! 
 (video stops) 
 Adrian : That kick to Toby Kendall's head, that was completely unprovoked, am I right? 
 Yeah. Toby just lay there. 
 Adrian : All yours, Diane. 
 You keep referring to the plaintiff as "Toby" 
 Do you know Toby? Are you friends? 
 Should I ask Mr. Boseman if he wants to answer that question? 
 Objection. 
 Diane : Okay, let me ask you again. 
 Do you know Toby? 
 Man : He's a friend. 
 And were you together that night... trying to break into cars? 
 We didn't break into anything. 
 Because you were caught, Objection. before you could... 
 He's already answered the question. 
 Adrian, why don't you sit down? 
 Because I'm too passionate. 
 Oh, okay. 
 (Diane chuckles) 
 Uh, Mr. Hunter, this video. 
 Adrian, would you mind rewinding? 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 (video rewinding) 
 Diane : Is this... the beginning of the recording here? 
 Yeah, what-what do you mean? 
 This is where you turned on your camera, right here? 
 My cell phone, yeah. 
 Diane : There was no other footage before this moment? 
 Diane, what do you have? 
 Did you know that your video has metadata attached to it? 
 Even if you try to erase it, the metadata tells us that there is one minute and 20 seconds missing from the head of it. 
 Objection! 
 Diane :  Well? 
 $4 million. 
 Why? 
 The video. 
 It's bad. 
 We've been asked to keep the settlement under $500,000. 
 By... 
 Cook County. 
 They fired their last civil law firm for being profligate. 
 Oh, here they come. 
 Just play the radical. 
 Come on, I'm bad at it. 
 Are you kidding? 
 You scare me. 
 Not with Diane. 
 She'll know. 
 Diane :  You are robbing the taxpayers. 
 No, Diane, no, you're implying that this so-called missing video shows something nefarious. 
 I'm not saying anything other than what the police report states. 
 Come on, Diane, you know you got to give up something. 
 $140,000. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Cook County will no longer have a gun put to its head with these lawsuits. 
 Seriously... gun to its head? 
 How nice to be able to talk in metaphors when people like our clients have a literal gun to their head. 
 Adrian : Look, Diane, I understand you want to impress your new client with your toughness, but look at the optics. 
 You got three cops... three white cops... kicking the crap out of this defenseless kid. 
 Yes, this poor, innocent car thief. 
 So that's your strategy? Blame the victim? 
 No, this is our strategy. 
 Your firm has personally enriched itself to the tune of $180 million with these police brutality cases. 
 You are robbing the tax dollars coming from the city's most vulnerable African-American communities... 
 Diane, when did you get so cynical? 
 You should be on this side of the table, not... 
 We're both using this case, Lucca. 
 Why don't you just stick to the facts? 
 Adrian : Okay, all right. 
 We'll come down to $4 million, but that's it. 
 And I'll go up to $400,000. 
 We'll see you tomorrow, Diane. 
 Maia. 
 Research everything you can on recent police brutality payouts for the last ten years. 
 If you need another associate, grab one. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I ask something? 
 Sure, go ahead. 
 (door closes) 
 Are we on the right side on this one? 
 (exhales sharply) 
 We are on a necessary side. 
 People I thought with all my heart were guilty turned out to be innocent. 
 And people I thought were saints... they, um, they weren't. 
 That's why you don't go on instinct. 
 You wait, you listen... and watch. 
 Eventually, everyone reveals themself. 
 Hey, we're pooling our resources. You want to join? 
 No, it's all right. Thanks. 
 (whispers): Where were you? 
 I'm only a third of the way through this. 
 A partner just gave me an assignment, and I can pull another associate onto it. 
 You want to do it? 
 Yes! 
 Yeah? Okay. 
 (all arguing over each other) 
 Wait, hey... wait a second, wait a second. 
 It's a pose. That's all. 
 They will come up. 
 We don't want to bury too much time in this, Adrian. 
 Adrian : Barbara, look, Cook County, they're trying to break our backs on this thing. 
 We bend here, they use it against us on the next suit. 
 Lucca? 
 You know Diane. Will she come up in her offer? 
 I think Diane's got something to prove and she's out to prove it. 
 Adrian : So what? 
 I have something to prove. 
 We all have something to prove. 
 She's retiring? 
 Yes. 
 She wants to go out with a win. 
 Let's get her up to a million, and move on to the next. 
 No, Barbara, she wants to cave. I'm telling you. 
 We'll talk when you get her to a million. 
 Lucca, where was the support? Huh? 
 I was asked a question, that's all. 
 Yeah, you don't think I can take Diane down? 
 No, I just think I'm not helping. What is this? 
 Ask for CFO Kendrick, with the accent. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I'm getting held up at the corporate level. 
 She'll raise her tone. 
 Come on, help me out. 
 Mr. Boseman, I... 
 (in English accent): Yes, hello. 
 Adrian Boseman calling for Mr. Kendrick. 
 Well, he'd love to talk to him now if he could. 
 He's just popping out to lunch. 
 (chuckles) 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 (whispers): That was fantastic! 
 Narrator : After graduating from law school with honors, Diane became an assistant district attorney. 
 She made her reputation as someone who fought hard for the truth, and after five years... 
 Oh, my God, was I ever that young? 
 I can't believe you're leaving us, Diane. 
 Oh, not in spirit. 
 If you ever think of coming back, you don't go anywhere else first. 
 I promise, Renee. 
 Wait a minute... you promised me. 
 Diane : Oh, Ethan. 
 (both chuckle) 
 We have partners I'd throw out the door to make room for you. 
 Wow. Well, it's... it's good to be wanted. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Hi. (chuckles) Lenore! 
 Oh, look at you. 
 Wow, wow. 
 (chuckles) 
 Congrats. 
 Maia tells us what a great mentor you are. 
 Oh, she's such a doll. I love her. 
 By the way, uh, Glenn's been trying to reach you. 
 We're running out of time on the Provence house. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, my God, I am so jealous. 
 Provence! 
 Yeah, but only if I make the down payment. 
 Well, yes, I wanted to get my ducks in a row first. 
 You know, your investments are working so well for you, Diane, I was wondering if it's not smarter to borrow the money, and leave it in the fund. 
 Hello, darling. 
 Oh, there they are, the power couple. 
 Congratulations. 
 So when are you two getting married? 
 Maia : Mom, no! 
 Lenore : Why? There's no Supreme Court excuse anymore. 
 Have you talked to your uncle? 
 Who, Jax? No. 
 Mm. 
 He didn't talk to you about the fund? 
 No, why? 
 Nothing, just you two are so close. 
 If he calls you and asks you to talk to anyone, call me first, okay? 
 What's going on, Dad? 
 Nothing, you know Jax, he tends to talk kind of wild. 
 I don't want to make everyone crazy. 
 Okay. 
 Good night, honey. 
 Good night. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Maia : Do you see that car in the background? 
 My parents own one just like it. 
 It's not the car they were breaking into. 
 I know, but, uh, well, do you see the perimeter light on? 
 That's what happens when someone bumps it. 
 It has four perimeter cameras, and they automatically record and save to its hard drive. 
 You're saying if we contact the owner of that car, they'll have a video of this encounter? 
 It's on its hard drive. 
 They can't erase it. 
 Good job! 
 Thanks. 
 I like these daisies much better than the lilies. 
 (phone rings) 
 Hey, what's up? 
 What? 
 Amy : They have a warrant. 
 They're searching our apartment. 
 They're asking if we have a joint bank account. 
 What? Why? 
 I don't know. 
 They've impounded our computers and they're looking for documents on your parents' business. 
 I think it's about your dad. 
 (chuckles) Check this out. 
 Maia, I have to call you back. 
 (line ringing) 
 Dad, the FBI are searching my apartment. 
 They say it's about you. What's going on? 
 So, you're saying Mr. Kendall was high on PCP? 
 Yes. He was crazed, grabbing for our guns. 
 How could you... 
 Your accountant is on the line. 
 Tell him I'll call him back. 
 He says it's important. 
 Andrew : ... That we're trained to recognize. 
 When we saw how he was acting... 
 (thunder rumbles) 
 Dad! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Go see your mom. It's okay. 
 Oh, Dad. 
 Sweetheart, listen to me. 
 Everything's gonna be fine, I promise. 
 I know. 
 I love you. I didn't do it, Maia. 
 I know, I know! 
 Glenn, what's going on? 
 Is it the house? 
 No, what? 
 When? 
 I don't understand, I just... 
 
 
 
 Reporter : Many on Wall Street are asking, is Henry Rindell the new Madoff? Earlier today, the FBI shuttered the invitation-only investment fund, calling it a multibillion dollar Ponzi scheme, whose collapse has decimated the accounts of many of the nation's liberal elites. 
 Glenn, what about my... my retirement money? 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Reporter : This makes the operation seem profitable and legitimate even though no actual profit is being made. 
 You've been working out. 
 Yeah. 
 With someone not me. 
 You were busy. 
 With $8.3 billion in assets, it'll be... 
 I know her. the fourth largest Ponzi scheme in America... 
 I hope you didn't have any money wrapped up with them. 
 My aunt did. 
 God, I'd sure hate to be her right now. 
 Talk about the most hated person in America. 
 The name originated with Charles Ponzi, who promised 50% returns on investments in only 90 days. 
 Reporter 2 : ... Shuddered at the invitation of the investment fund, calling it a multibillion-dollar... 
 (door opens) 
 Ponzi scheme... 
 Man : Lenore? 
 Lenore : Rupert? 
 Hey! 
 Lenore : Did you see him? 
 Rupert : Yes, yes, yes. 
 Henry is fine. 
 Good, good. 
 Hey, Maia. 
 Amy. I'm glad you're both here. 
 What's going on? 
 Your dad needs your help. 
 Your Uncle Jax made a deal with the feds. 
 Oh, my God, he's a monster. 
 What's he saying? 
 That Henry created the Ponzi scheme. 
 Oh, my... 
 Rupert : Jax claims he had nothing to do it with it. 
 He was just a fig leaf for Henry's scam. Come on. 
 Lenore : That is insane. That doesn't even make sense. 
 Jax traded stocks. 
 We were just the ambassadors. 
 That's why it's important that we all agree on our understanding here. 
 Maia? 
 Yeah. 
 There are signatures on on each one of the money transfers. 
 I need you to take a look at them. 
 Actually, we should go. 
 What? No, no. Why? 
 We shouldn't be here for this. Let's go. 
 What are you talking about? I just need Maia to initial these documents. 
 Rupert. 
 You're Henry and Lenore's lawyer, not Maia's. 
 Well, I'm the family lawyer. 
 That's not true. 
 Why are you arguing with him? Maia. 
 Dad's in trouble. We need your help. 
 Maia, just look at these documents. 
 Rupert, do we have attorney-client privilege? 
 Well, no, but we're covered by your mom's privilege. 
 Do we have attorney-client privilege? 
 N-no, but... 
 You're not my lawyer, then. 
 Mom. 
 God, what does this mean? Um... it means I basically lost half my life. 
 I don't have a retirement. 
 My wife and I will have to work until we drop dead. 
 They should go to jail, every single one of 'em. 
 Even the daughter. She had to know, too. 
 I-I just worked 20 years... for no reason. 
 Woman : My husband and I will lose our house, our cars, everything. 
 Our kids will have nothing. 
 We've lost everything that we've worked for. 
 Almost everyone... 
 That was hard. 
 You did good. 
 It's a nightmare. 
 You're gonna need a lawyer. 
 Diane? 
 Yes? 
 Are you hearing this? 
 It's all gone? 
 Well, the Rindells have $13.8 million on hand, and that's from an initial investment of $8 billion. 
 They never invested a cent? 
 Not after 2008. 
 The housing bubble. There was a shortfall, and they made it up with money from new investors. 
 But I steered people to them. 
 The Women's Fund, all their money. 
 I even told Emily's List to put their 401k there. 
 I know there's a lot for you to process, Diane, but... we need to think about a few things and act fast. 
 The escrow? 
 Yes. 
 There will be a penalty, but we must get out of it now. 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 And you need to delay your retirement. 
 The government might freeze your account and put you on a living-wage budget. 
 What? Why? 
 Well, they can claw back past earnings and distribute them among all the victims. 
 That's what they did with Madoff. 
 But my personal account... that is my money, isn't it? 
 No, not necessarily. 
 They'll allow you to keep a subsistence-level amount of cash, but they might freeze the rest. 
 So am I broke? 
 Well, I don't like to talk that way, but... you can't live the way you've been living for more than a few months. 
 You'll need to keep your job. 
 Or maybe sublet this apartment. 
 Is there a reason you and your husband are delaying your divorce? 
 What? 
 You and your husband are separated, right? 
 Yes. 
 Well, if your separation is permanent, then you really should consider memorializing with the divorce, otherwise, his accounts could be frozen, too. 
 This is a nightmare. 
 Again, you need to act first. 
 And the first thing is to delay your retirement. 
 Diane : This is not just about my financial situation. 
 I'm also afraid I would miss practicing the law. 
 I was in the midst of the Kendall deposition, and I thought, uh, "My God, I love this... this is what I do." 
 So what do you propose? 
 That I not leave. 
 That I close the case, and, um, that I stay on. 
 In what position? 
 This position. My-my current position. 
 You signed your exit agreement. 
 Well, yes, but I would suggest we rip that up for the moment. 
 Unfortunately, I don't think that works for us. 
 Why not? 
 Well, we're kind of top-heavy, like you said. 
 We already reorganized around your leaving. 
 This is my firm. 
 No, it was your firm. 
 Look, if you want to stay on as an emeritus, we can discuss that. 
 And lose my equity? 
 What is to keep me from taking my clients out the door with me? 
 Where would you take them? 
 So, um, I was thinking about what you said at the party. 
 That you would have partners thrown out the door to make room for me. 
 Now, you're looking for an emeritus position? 
 Uh, no, a... partnership. 
 I mean, I'm not... looking for my name on the door, but... 
 Well, let me talk to my partners. 
 So I was thinking about what you said at my party, and I realized... why am I leaving the law? 
 We're not done breaking the glass ceiling. 
 You're not retiring? 
 No. 
 But I am leaving my old firm. 
 I was, um, hoping to join you. 
 What's going on, Renee? 
 What do you mean? 
 I've been to three firms today. 
 A month ago, they would've been climbing all over themselves. 
 Uh... it's a tough time, Diane. 
 No, it's not. That's bull. 
 Diane, you're not a spring chicken. 
 Oh, so it's ageism, with my book of clients? 
 Call them, Diane. 
 How many will actually go with you? 
 How many lost money with the Rindells? 
 I'm not the Rindells. 
 You referred them to people. 
 The Chicago Women's Fund? 
 It's out $82 million. 
 They may have to close their doors. 
 Just give it some time. 
 It's a bad time right now. You're poison. 
 No firm will hire you. 
 Just let it pass. 
 You want a divorce? 
 Your accountant called. 
 Without a divorce, Kurt, your finances will suffer from the same, uh... from the same... thing. 
 It's about money, not about us. 
 What do you want? 
 No, this is... this is in your lap. 
 I didn't leave you. 
 Actually, you did. 
 You slept with your student, so... 
 Okay, my accountant said that... my bank account will be frozen. 
 A divorce will, uh, save your account and just memorialize what we're doing now. 
 Which is? 
 Living apart. 
 How are you? 
 I'm great. 
 I'm broke and out of a job, but, hey... (scoffs) bad things happen to good people. 
 You're out of a job? 
 Yes, I signed my exit agreement, and they... 
 (crying): ... they won't... 
 Oh, my God. 
 This is my life, and it's... it's over. 
 It's gone. (sniffs) 
 I'm losing my apartment. 
 I'm unemployable. How is that possible? 
 How is my life suddenly so... meaningless?! 
 It isn't. 
 How can you work so hard every single day of your life and have nothing to show for it? 
 Not a friend! 
 I'm a friend. 
 Kurt? 
 I feel bad enough already. 
 I don't want to be responsible for your going broke. 
 Divorce me. 
 Receptionist : Good morning, Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee, Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan, Tannebaum & Associates. 
 Diane. I am so sorry. 
 Are you okay? 
 That depends... will I get my money back? 
 I'm sorry, my lawyer's directed me not to answer that. 
 Then don't ask me. 
 We may have a little opening right here. 
 Go for the jugular. 
 Mr. Kendall, tell us which car in the parking lot you were hoping to steal. 
 Objection. 
 It is a completely fair question. 
 Not in evidence. 
 Not close to being in evidence. 
 Can I ask my question, please? 
 Sure, I'm just preserving my objection for the record. 
 Diane : Which car was it, Mr. Kendall? 
 Was it the sports car here? 
 That's the one they found with the window broken. 
 Uh, I don't-I don't know. Um... 
 I-I don't remember. 
 You don't remember which car you were there to steal? 
 Come on, Diane, is this what you're left with... badgering someone in a wheelchair? 
 Excuse me, objection as to badgering. 
 I understand you're not happy with your life, but don't take it out on our client. 
 Okay, we're done here. 
 Man :  There you are. 
 I want this firm to know she stole my money. 
 My kids are not going to college because she stole my savings. 
 You can't get away! 
 I'm gonna sue you for every single cent! 
 Then do it! 
 But right now, get out! 
 When they see you cry, it makes them happy. 
 So get it out of your system here. 
 You're on the other side. 
 I had a friend. 
 Went through the same thing. 
 Said it was hell for a few months. 
 Harden yourself. 
 Ignore what people say. 
 Keep your head down and keep working. 
 You're a new associate? 
 Work is your friend. 
 Don't watch TV, don't look at the Internet. 
 Do you have a book? 
 Then read it. 
 Keep it with you at all times. 
 Don't give them the satisfaction... of making eye contact. 
 It's hard. 
 But it ends. 
 Woman : That's the video, Mrs. Lockhart. 
 Excuse me? 
 The car video. The one you asked for. 
 Oh, right. 
 Oh, and, uh, Mr. Boseman is here to see you. 
 He... what? 
 Did we have a negotiation? 
 No. 
 (sighs) 
 Okay, give me a minute. 
 Hmm. 
 Adrian. 
 Hey. 
 I didn't know we had a meeting. 
 No, no, we didn't. 
 Uh, we're not. 
 I'm here to chat. 
 How you doing, Diane? 
 (chuckles) 
 Come on, sympathy doesn't suit you, Adrian. 
 What do you need? 
 You. 
 Me? 
 I... want you to join our firm. 
 (laughs) 
 You're broke, Diane. 
 You're looking for a place to land... and nobody wants you 'cause of this Rindell scandal. 
 I'm tired, Adrian. I want to go home. 
 You know, we're in the midst of expanding. 
 You could be... our diversity hire. 
 (both laughing) 
 (laughing): Well, if this is about the case, it doesn't make any difference. 
 I mean, even if I joined you, I can't use what I know. 
 It's not about this case. 
 It's about the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one. 
 Diane... we don't want you to beat us. 
 I would much rather you help us beat them. 
 I'd be a partner? 
 Yes, and you'd be back on the right side of things. 
 Why aren't you afraid of the Rindell scandal? 
 I'm poison. Haven't you heard? 
 Yeah, here's the thing, Diane. 
 The Rindells ran an... invitation-only investment fund, and you know what? 
 (clicks tongue) 
 They never invited black folk. 
 You got screwed here, Diane. 
 And you know the best response? 
 You come with me, and you screw 'em back. 
 Explain it to me... what did you do? 
 Okay, I... 
 What did I... 
 I called an audible. 
 Ugh. 
 It was an audible, Barbara. 
 Don't act like that's a thing here. 
 You made a decision by fiat. 
 You didn't care what the rest of the partners thought. 
 No! I saw an opportunity, Oh. and I thought it was an opportunity What opportunity? that we would all appreciate. 
 What opportunity? 
 Diane Lockhart's firm will be representing Cook County on every single one of their police brutality cases from here until eternity! 
 Now, at the very least, we just stole away their strongest attorney. 
 At the most, she helps us with strategy. 
 She can't tell us anything. 
 Not on this case she can't, but on every other case going forward she can. 
 Barbara, are you worried about losing the firm's culture or something? 
 If that's what you're worried about we can make sure... 
 Adrian, stop. 
 You want to know what I'm worried about? 
 Yeah, yes, I do. 
 Every rumor I hear about Lockhart is that she doesn't know her place. 
 She's not gonna be happy until she's in the inner circle. 
 You're describing yourself, Barbara. 
 (laughing): You're describing me. 
 We're ambitious people, and we need people like that around to grow this company. 
 Lucca. 
 Yes, but we don't want people who are only happy when they're giving orders. 
 Lucca, you worked with Diane Lockhart. 
 Yeah, for a year. 
 This is not helpful, Barbara. 
 Did you like working with her? 
 I don't think it mattered. 
 She was a partner; I was an associate. 
 Yes, and if she came here, it would be the same thing. 
 Would you like that here? 
 Oh, God, Jesus. 
 God, help me. 
 Since when is that the criteria here? 
 Lucca? 
 Should we bring in Diane as a partner? 
 Yes. 
 Why? 
 She's a good lawyer. 
 She's passionate, idealistic and cunning. 
 (laughs) 
 Anything else? 
 No. 
 She would be an asset. 
 Thanks. 
 (door closes) 
 Well... 
 (clears throat) 
 ... that went in a different direction than I thought. 
 She can't be a name partner. 
 I didn't offer her that. 
 Junior partner is fine. 
 With an equal equity draw. 
 Don't you ever call an audible again. 
 You got it. 
 (women moaning) 
 Oh, my God, they're saying they have a s*x tape of us. 
 "TMZ Exclusive Footage: Maia Rindell Lesbian s*x Tape!" 
 Oh, God, don't look at it. Just close it. 
 Oh, my God, it's like waving a red flag at a bull. 
 Suddenly I'm a lesbian temptress? 
 This isn't even us. This person has a tattoo. 
 Okay, listen to me, you have to stay sane, okay? 
 You have to ignore this stuff. 
 Man (on TV) : They're obviously lying. All of 'em, right? 
 The whole family. 
 Hey. 
 (man continues speaking indistinctly on TV) 
 Are you leaving? 
 Yes. 
 For where? 
 Another firm. 
 I don't want a divorce. 
 Maybe it's smart, but I... I don't want it. 
 They'll freeze your account. 
 Let 'em. 
 Kurt, you're not a cowboy. 
 We don't live in a world with cowboys. 
 I don't want the door to close completely. 
 It is closed between us. 
 Then divorce me. 
 But I won't do it.

 I'm leaving here and going to Reddick and Boseman. 
 Oh, the bunch of schvartzes? 
 David : You can't do that. 
 Yes, I can. 
 You give them proprietary information, we'll sue you. 
 I don't need to. 
 Howard : Well, what about the police brutality case you've been working on? 
 I'm handing it off to you. 
 Ugh. 
 Oh, and you may want to look at this. 
 The police were unprovoked. 
 I could be wrong, but it looks like a $6 million payout to me. 
 Anyway, good-bye. 
 It was fun. 
 Want the door closed? 
 Could you please stand up? 
 Stand over there. 
 Is there anything on this desk that is yours? 
 Uh, no.
