 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 What do you want me to do? I can't do everything at once. 
 I can't. 
 Solomon Waltzer. I'm here to see Diane Lockhart and Adrian Boseman. 
 Oh, they'll just be a minute. 
 Look, I only have two hands. What do you want me to do? 
 Balloons for Lucca Quinn? Leave them here. 
 [CHUCKLES] Mr. Waltzer. 
 Lemond Bishop. 
 You assisted on one of my cases a few years back. 
 Yes, Mr. Bishop. How are you? [LAUGHS] 
 [SIGHS] Things are, uh, not bad. 
 They're returning to normal. 
 I've, uh, taken up golf. 
 [LAUGHS] I wish I could. 
 The knees. That's why God created golf carts. 
 Can you hear me? Hello? lan, no, I'm off the elevator now. 
 I just... 
 How's he doing? Yes. Thanks for asking. 
 Uh, sorry. No, I... 
 I was just saying that I think what Malcolm needs is just a little more, uh... 
 What in the hell? 
 Uh, no, I'm sorry. It's just something at work. 
 Let me call you back. 
 What is... what is going on? Drawing up a prenup. 
 Are you serious? With Colin Sweeney? He murdered two of his wives. 
 One. And he was found innocent. 
 What is going on with this place? 
 COLIN: Shut the f*ck up. No, you shut the f*ck up. 
 You're crazy. 
 Who is more of a threat to whom? Not I. Have I ever hit you? 
 You hit me all the time. No, I spank you. 
 There is a big difference. And you like it. 
 WOMAN: Don't flatter yourself. Okay, okay. Let's just calm this down. 
 You tell your client to calm this down. 
 I'm about ready to say, "f*ck your prenup.” Whoa, whoa. Now, we've settled all of the big issues here. 
 Equitable distribution, that is huge... 
 I have not agreed to that. You... you see what I'm up against? 
 She's nuts! She'll be the death of me. [PHONE CHIMES] 
 If you're lucky. God, and she's like a drug. 
 I hired a lawyer. You what? 
 Yeah, for this and the other case. The Foreign bullshit. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices. Naftali, that is a very complicated case. 
 You really should let us handle it. No, my new lawyer. 
 He wants to meet us at his office now. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] Solomon is here. 
 MAIA: Okay, I've got another one. 
 Oh, come on. 
 This is not funny. Who is doing this? Marissa? 
 No, I don't think so. Is it the partners? 
 Because I already said I don't want a shower. 
 Look, this one came with a note. 
 Give it here. 
 "Congratulations on your non-shower." 
 "Your non-shower?" Who writes like that? 
 Could you pass me my cell? 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] 
 Lucca, they called me in. Wait, what? 
 Did you send me balloons? I don't know. Do you have balloons? 
 Colin, I have 84 balloons. What? 
 There are 84 balloons in my office. MARISSA: Oh, my God. 
 Someone's overdoing it. And make that 96. 
 Lucca, I sent you one set of balloons. I don't know who's sending you the rest. 
 They're all from you! Look, could you just call Balloon Bouquet Express and tell them to stop. I think there's been a mix-up. 
 Colin. We're ready for you. 
 Lucca, I have to call you back. They're telling me right now whether I'm the Democratic nominee. Right now? 
 Yup. I'll call you back. 
 So here we all are. Small talk's over with. 
 And we have no cases outstanding against each other. 
 So what can we do for you, Sol? The Chicago PD case, you did well. 
 Well, thank you, Sol. You didn't give up. 
 We're young and scrappy. [DIANE LAUGHS] 
 Yes, you are. 
 I wanna consider a merger. 
 Of our firms? Yes. 
 You're the whitest white-shoe law firm in Chicago. 
 Why would we want to merge with you? 
 For security and legacy. 
 We have offices in Washington and London. 
 You'd have your pick of clients, all the prerogatives of senior partners. 
 And why us? You beat me. 
 [LAUGHS] I'm not used to being beaten. 
 No. 
 You just got written up in the Sun-Times about your lack of African-American lawyers and clients. 
 I believe they said you were... hypocritical? 
 You're buying diversity, Sol. 
 Yes. ADRIAN: Ah. 
 And I'm willing to pay for it. 
 We join you, how do we not become the minority lawyers? 
 Contractual language. I want that not to happen. 
 You think I'm being hypocritical. I'm not. 
 I want what you want, a firm that reflects the make-up of America. 
 And If I have to pay to do that, I'm willing. 
 [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] 
 ADRIAN: All right. Wait, just wait! 
 Wait! I'm sorry. 
 One at a time. I'll go first. 
 "One at a time, I'll go first." Seriously? 
 What kind of leadership is that? I was in the meeting. 
 You weren't even there, Julius. Whose fault was that? 
 I was available. Can I make a proposal, please? 
 Solomon runs the biggest law firm in the Midwest. 
 He's offering us all equity partnerships. 
 He will guarantee we will not be swamped. 
 All right. How does he guarantee that? 
 We will have off-ramps after the first year and after the second year. 
 Yeah, but we don't own our lawyers. We don't own our clients. 
 Yes, let's talk about our clients. 
 What I mean is even if we decide to go independent, even if we make that choice, our clients may not follow us. 
 Yeah, I mean clients like Lemond Bishop, the top drug dealer in Chicago. What? 
 I was coming to work today on the phone with my police captain husband and what do I see in reception? Lemond Bishop. 
 This is a man who is responsible for threatening my family, threatening my son in preschool. 
 Lemond Bishop has been our client for a year now. 
 Why didn't I know this? Well, we don't advertise it. 
 And we only assist his personal attorney with bigger cases. 
 Then in the conference room, I see Colin Sweeney, who's killed what, two of his wives? One. And he was found not guilty. 
 Liz, this is not the subject, Liz. No, no, no. We were just arguing about losing our identity to Solomon Waltzer. 
 What is our identity? What are we becoming? 
 Defense attorneys. Bullshit. 
 Even defense attorneys draw the line. 
 Why are we drawing the line at my clients? 
 I mean, what about the double homicide, what about the union boss? 
 Wait, wait, no, no! Not the double homicide! 
 Ladies, let's not get... [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] 
 ADRIAN: Hold on! Wait! 
 ...drug dealers... 
 Okay! I am really late for a prenup negotiation. 
 This is what I'll say. 
 Let's meet back here at six and we will hash this out. 
 Is this your prenup with Colin Sweeney? 
 The man's a client, Liz. Hmm. 
 Now, we can talk about getting rid of him later if we need to. 
 I'll be back in two hours. [PHONE RINGS] 
 ADRIAN: Yes, yup. I am on my way. 
 Do we have a problem? I didn't think so. 
 You're late. I'm here with this demon. 
 I'm not a demon. Now, she's a demon with a lawyer. 
 I warned you, Mr. Sweeney. It would only be so much time before she got her own attorney. Oh, God. 
 And we're back at square one. No, no, no, no, no. 
 We already have lots of language in place, Mr. Sweeney. 
 Yeah, they can rip it up. But they won't. 
 They won't what? [GASPS] 
 I need to get on with this. I downed a little blue pill recently, so the clock is running, n'est-ce pas? 
 I've been shot, Mr. Sweeney. Call 911. 
 9112 Please, don't believe that nonsense. 
 I'm serious. I've had the seven hour erection. 
 I'm serious. am too. 
 Signing a prenup for me has always been such an effort... 
 Excuse me. 
 Call 911. I've been shot. What? 
 I've been shot. Call... I need an ambulance. 
 What are you talking about? I've been shot! 
 Oh, my God. Just... yeah, please. 
 Hello? Uh, there's... there's been a shooting. 
 Reddick, Boseman, and Lockhart on the 23rd floor... 
 It's an emergency. Someone's been shot. 
 Mr. Boseman. Is it because I'm a woman? 
 Marissa. You're interviewing men to replace Jay. I'm here. 
 I thought I was doing a good job as an investigator. 
 Marissa. No, I just wanna know why I'm not being given a chance to be the sole investigator. 
 [WHISPERS] I've been shot. 
 Call 911! I did. They're asking what happened. 
 A bullet to the chest. We need paramedics now. This is life and death. 
 Hold this to your chest, Adrian. Hold it. Where is the shooter? 
 On the floor? Elevator. 
 Come on, come on. 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] [GASPING] 
 Oh, dear God. Not more. 
 Go down the hall and get Diane and Liz. Tell them Boseman's been shot. 
 This is my first day. They're the partners at the end of the hall. 
 Tell them Boseman has been shot, now. Security. We've had a shooting here. 
 It was someone on the elevator just a minute ago. 
 So stop anyone who's coming down. Hold them. 
 No! This is not a drill! Do it! Adrian Boseman has been shot! 
 The shooter was on the elevator. DIANE: Are paramedics coming? 
 Yes. No, don't shut down the elevators either, the paramedics are coming. 
 Let me hold it. 
 DIANE: Tell security to meet them out front. 
 No, no, no, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be just fine. 
 [WHISPERS] I'm doing bad. You're doing great. 
 Look at me. Look at me, Adrian, look at me. 
 Just look in my eyes, right here. 
 I am right here. I am right here, okay? 
 [SLOW MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [BREATHING] 
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
 I'm going with him. Not in the ambulance. 
 No, I'm his wife. 
 You'll still have to follow, ma'am. Adrian, I'll meet you at the hospital. 
 [GASPING] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 Where's the victim? At the hospital. 
 Or heading to the hospital. I'm not sure which. 
 Are you a witness to the shooting? Yes. I mean, no. 
 I was here, but I didn't see... There were a lot of calls. 
 I wanna speak to Liz Lawrence. Reddick? 
 Oh, she went to the hospital too. Hi. I'm Marissa Gold, the investigator here. 
 Adrian Boseman was shot in the chest. He was still conscious when he left and he said there was an assailant in the elevator. 
 Description? He didn't have one. 
 I called down to have security stop anyone who was leaving the elevators. 
 We'll need this floor cleared. And I'll need those elevators locked. 
 Arlo, you talk to security downstairs. See if there's any security footage. 
 ARLO: Yes, sir. Because I like canoes... kayaks. 
 Kayaks, you simpleton. Okay. Kayak. 
 Mm-hm. So much better. 
 Put that in the contract. Don't call me simpleton. I want that in the contract. 
 No, what you want is to kill me. You wanna get me in a kayak and kill me. 
 Mr. Boseman, I'm at the law firm and it's getting pretty heated here. 
 Do you want me to just reschedule for tomorrow? 
 Where is he? Will you give me a call, please? 
 Why am I facing this nightmare... 
 She's thinking a two-hour surgery. How bad? 
 I don't know. A collapsed lung, but we'll know more soon. 
 Here we are again. What do you mean again? 
 The chemical scare and this. The chemical scare wasn't real. 
 I need your client list. 
 Look, we're investigating, but the shooter was in the elevator. 
 The crime scene had hundreds of people moving through it and more people riding up and down in it. 
 The surveillance cameras? None in the elevator, and the lobby cam didn't pick up anyone unusual. 
 But again, we don't know who we're looking for. 
 If we knew... Attorney-client privilege. 
 Attorney-client privilege is not a suicide pact. 
 Look, whoever shot Adrian wanted to kill him, and Adrian is alive, so this isn't over. All right. Let us talk about it. 
 That's all I ask. 
 Listen, we can't do that. We don't know if the shooter was one of our clients. 
 Adrian was on TV. It could be anyone who saw him. 
 They need someplace to start, Diane. 
 And without that list, this is a needle in a haystack. 
 We are officially prohibited from giving our list to the police. 
 Right. Officially. 
 No. 
 MAN: There he is. COLIN: Thanks. Thank you. 
 Colin, you're our man. I'm flattered, Frank. All right. 
 Well, just don't take it for granted. 
 Even though Democrats have always won in the first, these are strange times. 
 Well, I'm gonna go out there and kick some butt. 
 Great. That's why we chose you. All right. Thanks. 
 Thank you. Um, your girlfriend, Lucca... 
 Yeah. She works at Reddick/Boseman, the law firm, right? Yes. Why? 
 Well, I don't mean to unnerve you, but I just got a text, there's been a shooting there. I'm sorry, what? 
 A shooting. A friend on another floor says paramedics are taking someone away. 
 [STAMMERS] Who? He didn't say. You should call her. 
 Uh, yeah, I... Um, yeah, uh, excuse me. 
 I'm sure everything's all right. 
 [LINE RINGING] 
 AUTOMATED VOICE: Your call has been forwarded... 
 ...automated voice messaging system. Hey, all right. 
 Lucca Quinn is not available. At the tone, please record your message. 
 Hey, Lucca, uh... When you've finished recording, you may hang up... Hey.

 [HORN HONKING] 
 [BRAKES SCREECH] 
 NARRATOR: Has the rat race gotten you down? 
 Do you dream of spotless beaches and cool breezes? 
 If you act now, Come on! we have a once in a lifetime offer... 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! 
 ...Tree trip to Belize. All you have todo is... 
 Has the rat race gotten you down? What the f*ck? 
 Come on! [HORN HONKS] 
 Lucca? I'm awake, I'm awake. 
 More balloons? You're okay. 
 Yeah, I'm just trying to take a nap. Why? 
 You don't know what's going on? What do you mean? 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Hey, Mrs. Reddick. 
 I need our latest client list. Sure. 
 You want me to call Julius for it? No. 
 No. Do you have access to it yourself? 
 I should, on my computer. 
 Would you email it to me? Yeah. Right away. 
 [LAUGHING] What? 
 [PHONE CHIMES] 
 This is unofficial? Yes. 
 Husband and wife? Yes. 
 The world's gone crazy. Mm. 
 I can't remember when it was sane. 
 My daughter says the same thing. 
 She's a journalist. USA Today. 
 She can't remember a time when reporters weren't screamed at or spat upon or targeted. 
 And that's after two years. 
 What will it look like two years from now? 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 Well, you're a font of optimism. [CHUCKLES] 
 One has to remember normal, or every new outrage will be absorbed and accepted. 
 I studied medicine. It's Wilder's law of initial value. 
 You have to know how a body acts unaffected by stimuli so you can judge the stimuli. 
 What good is judgment if you can't do anything about it? 
 What's the good of eyesight if you have nothing to look at? 
 I think we're gonna need some time to discuss your proposal, Sol. 
 Don't worry about that. That's not why I'm here. 
 I like Adrian. I just wanna make sure he's well. 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] Oh, excuse me. 
 Hello? MAN: Diane, I'm here with five unexpected visitors. Mr. Lester? 
 Yes, and I'm speaking to you from Lemond Bishop's house where five representatives of the Chicago Police Department have forced their way in and are insisting on questioning him. 
 About what? About a shooting at your office. 
 They're insisting Mr. Bishop qualifies as a quote unquote person-of-interest. 
 Put them on the line. 
 Mr. Bishop's lawyer... 
 They're, uh, declining the invitation. 
 Look, I was under the distinct impression that who is and who is not a client is considered privileged information. Am I mistaken in that belief? 
 No, and I don't know how they found out he was a client, but I'm on my way. 
 Please tell Lemond not to say anything until I get there. 
 Believe it or not, I knew that. 
 [HORN HONKS] 
 No, but I need you to help me with Lemond Bishop. 
 The police are questioning him. Wait, Diane. 
 I'm trying to catch up. Where is Adrian? 
 He is still in surgery. But the police are already questioning Bishop about his shooting. Oh, my God. Did Bishop... 
 No. I mean, I don't know, but that wouldn't make sense. 
 Listen, we're short-handed and we need to put up a good show for Bishop. 
 Yeah. I got it. I'm on my way. 
 What do you mean? You're on your... Where are you going? 
 Aclient's house. I'm okay. You're going to Lemond Bishop's. 
 I heard. Colin, I'm okay. 
 It's sweet you rushed here, but I'm okay. 
 Lucca, he's the top killer in Chicago. No, he's not. 
 He's out of prison, he's going straight. 
 Oh, my God. Are you crazy? How can you be so naive about your own clients and so cynical about everything else? I have to go. 
 No, no, no. Lucca, the person that shot... 
 ...that shot your boss is still out there. It could be Bishop. 
 That's not Bishop. That's not what he does. 
 Yeah. He just hires other people to kill for him. 
 Colin, I have to do my job. The same way you have to do yours. 
 Okay. All right. Then I'm coming with you. 
 No, you're not. 
 I'm not your property. You're not my husband. 
 Then what am I to you, Lucca, huh? 
 I don't know. I really don't. 
 I need you to push all of Adrian's cases and meetings just until Friday. 
 JULIUS: Are the doctors being that optimistic? 
 No, but we will deal with it on Friday. 
 We have to appear optimistic. [LINE BEEPS] 
 Listen, that's my call-waiting. Okay. Keep me in touch. 
 Hello? MAIA: Oh, my God, Diane. 
 I can't get ahold of anyone. Is it true? 
 Yes. But I'll have to call you back. No. No. 
 I'm at the Sweeney prenup. They want to continue. 
 All right. Just tell them we will be in touch on Friday. 
 Hey, it's Sweeney time. 
 Diane, Sweeney wants to do it alone. 
 Maia, I need you to take care of this. 1 will call you in an hour. 
 Adrian Boseman is in the hospital. There was a shooting... 
 Okay. This is a trick. This is a lawyer trick. 
 I don't even know why that matters. 
 You can sign this prenup right now, Mr. Sweeney. 
 Yes, unless you want to be a little girl. 
 Oh, my God, when she says that to me... 
 No, sir. We are not signing this. Why? You're not a lawyer. 
 You're the coffee girl. I am Mr. Sweeney's lawyer and we object to the kayak exception. Why? It's a small matter. 
 All of Mr. Sweeney's fortune goes to Miss Amado if Sweeney is killed in a kayak accident? Are you serious? 
 I'm not going to kill him. How many times do I have to say it? 
 [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 I'm not sure why I'm being treated this way. 
 This will be dealt with quickly. 
 Ms. Lockhart. 
 Captain. 
 Mr. Bishop, your name is listed as an officer in Downstate Movers. 
 A company associated with... No, no. You gained entry into Mr. Bishop's house on the basis of an ongoing investigation. 
 Is that what they told you, Mr. Lester? 
 LESTER: Correct. I will permit you to ask Mr. Bishop questions only if they directly relate to that investigation. 
 Where were you at 11 a.m. today, Mr. Bishop? 
 At Reddick, Boseman, and Lockhart. 
 The law firm where Adrian Boseman was shot? 
 Yes. I had a meeting with Mr. Boseman, then I left. 
 So you were at the firm 40 minutes before the shooting? 
 I don't understand the theory here. 
 Do you think he went there in order to case the joint? 
 What was the meeting about? No. We're asking Mr. Bishop not to answer that question due to attorney-client privilege. 
 Are there any firearms in the house? We're asking Mr. Bishop not to answer that question. It's irrelevant to your investigation. 
 You think firearms in the house is irrelevant? 
 I think the relevant question you're looking for is did Mr. Bishop use firearms to shoot Adrian Boseman? 
 What about narcotics? 
 We're asking Mr. Bishop not to answer that question... 
 Ms. Lockhart, we are trying to find out who shot your partner. 
 No, you are using this investigation in order to intimidate Mr. Bishop because he's the one that got away. 
 You have legitimate questions, ask them. If not, stop wasting our time. 
 IAN: All right, everyone out. [SIGHS] 
 [CAR DOORS SLAM, ENGINE STARTS] 
 Fix this, Diane. 
 I came back to you because we did good work together, but this is not okay. 
 How did they even know I was a client? I don't know. 
 But we will fix this. 
 I had nothing to do with Boseman. 
 And this puts a bull's-eye on my back. 
 We will take it off. 
 How many months? Uh, eight, sir. 
 They grow up so fast. 
 Cherish every moment. 
 So this Captain Lawrence is married to one of your partners, isn't he? 
 Liz Reddick has nothing to do with your account. I do. 
 Yes, Chinese walls, I know. 
 In my experience, Chinese walls are porous. 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] DIANE: Uh, excuse me. 
 Uh, Maia, sorry, this is not a good time. 
 Sweeney just got a call from the police. They wanna question him. 
 sh1t. Where is Sweeney supposed to go? 
 First district. In an hour. 
 No, tell Captain Lawrence we'll do it in our offices. 
 How did you know it was Captain Lawrence? 
 [SIGHS] Wild guess. 
 The police are just pursuing their own agenda. 
 [SIGHS] I should call Dipersia. 
 If he knew what was going on, he would come back. 
 Right, he would. 
 Why did you leave your last firm? I'd been there too long. 
 You get stale. 
 Well, we're looking for diversity, and we need someone who'll start immediately. 
 [PHONE VIBRATES] Do you need to get that? 
 Do you mind? It's a friend who's about to give birth. 
 Oh, my God, no, no, answer, answer. 
 Lucca, are you all right? LUCCA: It's not me. It's Boseman. 
 He's been shot. What? 
 He's in surgery at Harbour. They think he'll be all right, but... 
 Oh, my God. What happened? Someone came to the firm. 
 We don't know who and the police aren't helping. 
 I'm on my way. Wait. Don't you wanna know more? 
 I'm on my way. 
 Thank you for the offer, but I have to go. 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 DIANE: Liz? Liz. 
 Can you hear me now? Liz, I just got off the freight elevator. 
 What's his status? How is he? 
 He's out of surgery. But they think it's gonna be a long recovery. 
 It's hard to hear you, where... where are you? 
 The twenty-second floor. The police have cordoned off the twenty-third. 
 Listen, I just came from your husband questioning Lemond Bishop. 
 And in about 20 minutes, I will be supervising his questioning of Colin Sweeney. 
 Well, that makes sense. They are our most violence-prone clients. 
 Liz. Neither had a single solitary reason to shoot Adrian. 
 We don't know that. Yes, we do. 
 Did you give your husband our client list? 
 Diane, our partner was shot. He has a bullet in his chest. 
 And I'm gonna move heaven and earth to keep him safe. 
 I understand that, but your husband is not working for us. 
 I don't tell my husband how to do his job. 
 Yeah, well, it'd be good if he returned the favor. 
 Hey, you're back. Hey, have you seen him? 
 Yeah, he's in here. 
 He's our investigator. 
 How long ago was he out of surgery? Two hours. 
 Did the police question him? Yeah, but they didn't get anything. 
 We need to make a list of all our clients for the last two years. 
 A list of all the people we beat in civil suits. 
 I already pulled their files. 
 Adrian. Can you hear me? 
 Adrian, it's Jay. Can you hear me? 
 If you can hear me, nod. 
 All right, good. Good. 
 Did you see the shooter? 
 Did you recognize him? 
 You didn't recognize him? 
 Was he black? 
 Good. He was white? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 What'd he say? He didn't see the shooter clearly, but what he did see was that he was Caucasian. 
 And his face was mostly covered with a scarf. 
 A red scarf. That's all he saw. 
 Okay. We should check the lobby security camera. 
 Yep. On our way. 
 Anything? 
 
 
 
 Yeah, the problem is the security cameras in the lobby use varifocal lenses. 
 When they zoom in and out, they lose pixels. 
 A lot of Chicago Police monitors are set on autofocus, so when a varifocal camera is hooked up to an autofocus monitor, it degrades the image. I just fell asleep. 
 Which is why we can see things the cops can't. 
 Wait, is that a red scarf? JAY: Looks like it. 
 He must've gotten off on a low floor and took the stairs down. 
 What's under the cap? 
 JAY: It looks like a do-rag. 
 How many white guys wear do-rags? 
 Let's take a look at the clients. 
 Which law firm? My life has been law firms for the last two weeks. 
 This law firm. Upstairs. Oh. I had a meeting around 11:30. 
 Just before the shooting. Maybe we should, uh, meet alone without Naftali. No, I want to know what I'm marrying. 
 Did you and Adrian Boseman argue? No. 
 Don't lie, Sweeney. The police will find out. 
 You argued with Boseman. I didn't. Yeah. Because he's your lawyer. 
 I'm calling a halt to this. IAN: I'm not done. 
 Uh, Maia, why don't you take them into Lucca's office to discuss the prenup? 
 What happened to this place? It's like a cattle auction. 
 The police moved us down a floor. Yeah, look, balloons. 
 Wow, very professional place you have, Sweeney. 
 It makes me feel really confident. 
 One of the reasons I liked this firm was you were able to handle the police. 
 I'm afraid you've lost that skill. What is this? 
 The location where I want my files sent. 
 I don't understand. That's my notice. 
 I'm taking my business to another firm. 
 Let me get Diane. No, she intimidates me. 
 You are intimidated by a duck. 
 Thank you for all your help, Millie. 
 NAFTALI: Maia. Maia. Goodbye. 
 Where are you going? Mr. Sweeney, which firm? 
 I've been asked not to say. 
 Okay. Uh, give us the afternoon. 
 Which firm is it? 
 No, I don't think you should be sending your files to Mr. Lester. 
 Listen, can we just... 
 Uh... 
 Yes, let's... let's just speak about it later, thank you. 
 Where is he going? Well, he won't say, but he wants the files sent here. 
 No, that's his home address. 
 And... and Bishop is replacing us too and he won't say where. 
 Bishop? Yes. 
 What are you doing in here? It's the only quiet place. 
 Listen, someone is coming after our clients. 
 I know, I was just going to tell you. Brandon Hayakawa is leaving us. 
 Did he say for where? No. 
 He's gonna send the address for the transfer of files within a week. 
 Someone's taking advantage of Boseman being out. 
 We've got to get on the phone with all of the clients. 
 Get all of the partners together. We should've made these calls earlier. 
 Who do you think it is? 
 Diane, how's Adrian? 
 Thank God. 
 Well, he's a fighter. 
 Okay, what? 
 No. Who said that? 
 I'm with Charles Lester right now. 
 And I asked him straight out where the files are going and he mentioned you. 
 Well, he's not telling the truth. 
 Adrian is in the hospital. I would never take advantage of that. 
 Then why would he lie? I have no idea. 
 Diane, you and I are on the same side in this fight. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 WOMAN: Charles Lester is on the other line. 
 Diane, hold on one second. 
 Charles, what's wrong? 
 Actually, it's Charles's assistant, uh, I have Diane Lockhart here. 
 She says you approved the files being sent to your offices. Is that true? 
 No, she's bluffing you. 
 Hold the files for a week. 
 MAIA: Thank you, I'll relay. 
 SOLOMON: Diane, I'm sorry. I don't know why Charles is saying this, but I can try to find out where he's going, you know, which firm. 
 Yeah. Thank you. No problem. 
 Oh, and Solomon, can we meet later on in the day to discuss the merger? 
 You really want to? Don't you wanna wait until Adrian is well? 
 No, I think it's a good idea to get the outline of the merger down. 
 All right. How about 5:00? 
 Five would be perfect. Thank you. 
 What did he say? 
 That we should meet. 
 [INHALES] 
 DIANE: Straighten your tie. 
 Don't sit on the floor. 
 Go to the law firm on the eighth floor, and ask for the use of their chairs. 
 I think it's time to get rid of the balloons. 
 I agree. 
 [POPPING] 
 JAY: So these are all our white clients? 
 Right. Frank Gwinn. 
 He was the shoe salesman, right? Yes. 
 JAY: We lost this case? MARISSA: Yes. 
 But Maia and Lucca were his lawyers. Mm-hm. 
 So why would he shoot Boseman? 
 The shooter didn't even get off the elevator, he just shot whoever was in front of him. 
 You think Boseman was just unlucky? I do. 
 What about Keith Fisk? The TV writer. 
 We won for him, but all he got was an apology. 
 That doesn't seem like the act of a TV writer. 
 Really? It does to me. 
 Guess we can rule out Ruth Eastman. And Maia. 
 Have we ever thought it might be Sweeney? I mean, he is a wife-killer. 
 Maybe. But there are two I'd put at the top of the list. 
 Dylan Stack and Felix Staples. Okay, where are they? 
 Well, Stack was having legal trouble because of us. 
 JAY: He's fighting in federal court. MARISSA: And he's out on bail. 
 And Staples lost his book deal. Could be either one. 
 Something about the red scarf screams Felix Staples to me. 
 No, they can sue the person who leaked it. I'm just the citizen journalist wanting to communicate it to the worl... 
 Let's see what he's up to. 
 Hey, have you talked to Adrian? Yes. 
 He tell you the assailant was Caucasian? 
 I'd rather not say. 
 That would mean eliminating half of our clients as suspects. 
 Possibly. No, definitely. 
 Boseman might not be certain of what he saw. He was in shock. lan, you are using our client list to find Adrian's killer, right? 
 What else is there? Advancing your agenda? 
 Given that someone shot your partner, I would think that my agenda is your agenda. 
 Diane. 
 There's a chance I might've made a mistake. With the client list. 
 What's going on with our clients? Solomon is coming after them. 
 We need to check in with our top clients. 
 Okay. Well, uh, I'll make some calls. 
 Uh, Julius and Lucca are splitting the list, and seeing who's happy. 
 Good. I'll, uh, I'll see what I can do. 
 And Diane... I'm sorry about that. 
 Hey, um... 
 I haven't been myself lately, so I'm sorry about that, too. 
 Well, you sound like yourself today. ldo, don't I? So let's start over. 
 Yes, good. 
 It's a two-woman job. 
 I'll talk to you. Very soon. 
 Lucca. Yeah? 
 Can you ask Colin about Solomon's representation at the DNC? 
 I think we should go after them. Sure. 
 But he won't have any control over them. 
 Well, he will now that they've endorsed him. 
 Endorsed? Yes. The First Congressional District. 
 He didn't tell you? I just heard from Julius. 
 Anyway, can you talk to Colin? 
 I think losing the Democratic business would... would devastate him. 
 Yeah. I will. 
 Solomon. How are you? Good. 
 You're a little tight for space here. Well, it's temporary. 
 May I also suggest you use my offices? 
 Two blocks away, I've got more than enough space. 
 Oh. Good. It'll give us a feel for the merger. 
 Yes, exactly. So you had some thoughts on the merger? 
 1 did. What were they? 
 Um... well, it's more visual than verbal. 
 Really? 
 I'm intrigued. Let's see. 
 We don't know each other well enough for me to know if you're kidding. 
 You've been going after our clients. That's not what I've been doing. 
 You've even managed to snare a few. 
 Everything has been totally above board. 
 You figured you could cherry-pick the most lucrative ones, dump the rest, and, uh, pick the carcass clean. Where do you get this? 
 The thing is, we are not a carcass. 
 At the moment, we are reeling from our senior partner getting shot. 
 But we will recover, and we will fight to hold onto our own clients. 
 And, just so you know, we are coming after yours. 
 Now you're being silly. No. 
 I realized it's all right that the world is crazy. 
 As long as I make my little corner of the world sane. 
 Diane... Now, get the hell out of my office. 
 COLIN: Lucca? 
 You came. Of course I came, you called. 
 What do you need? 
 Um... 
 So, uh... [LAUGHS] What? 
 You didn't tell me about being a congressman? 
 Oh, yeah. This morning. 
 Well, technically, I'm just endorsed, not an actual congressman. 
 Colin, you're the only Democrat running in Chicago's First against a Nazi. 
 You are a congressman. 
 Congratulations. Thanks. 
 And you didn't tell me. Yeah, well, there was a... 
 ...a lot going on. You asked me, "What am I to you?" 
 And I didn't answer. Yeah, you did. 
 No, I didn't. 
 Is that your answer? Yeah. 
 Okay. Okay. I'm still confused, but going with it. 
 I need you to talk to someone for me. 
 [LAUGHS] Who? 
 Frank Landau. Head of the Democratic Committee. 
 You really think that's Felix Staples? 
 Do you? 
 I don't know. I mean, Staples is all talk. 
 He'd never fire a gun. 
 "Please, Chicago. More dead lawyers, please.” That's Felix? A tweet two weeks ago. 
 Does he blame us for losing his book deal? 
 Well, yes. But I don't think enough to kill. 
 Is he in Chicago? MARISSA: Yeah. 
 For a speech at an alt-right Fight Club. 
 Frank, what's the emergency? Oh, I just wanted to chat. 
 Heard you were expanding here. Thought I'd congratulate you. 
 Yeah, I was gonna call you in the morning and brief you on it. 
 Anything that will embarrass the Democratic Committee? 
 No. More diverse clients, more diverse lawyers. 
 That's good for the Democrats. That's good for everyone. 
 What about Lemond Bishop? 
 What about him? 
 I heard you signed the top drug dealer in Chicago. 
 I don't think that's quite true. 
 You didn't sign Lemond Bishop? 
 No, I mean he's not the top drug dealer. 
 He's moved onto other things. Bullshit. 
 And what about Colin Sweeney, the wife-killer? 
 Did you sign him up, too? Who's telling you this? 
 Does it matter? Is it true? 
 You didn't think this would be a conflict of interest? 
 Frank, let's talk about this tomorrow. 
 No. I've had overtures from Diane Lockhart at Reddick/Boseman. 
 Might look good being represented by a black firm. 
 The question is, do you want to marry? 
 You're my addiction. What choice do I have? 
 You have one choice: no prenup or I keep the kayak exception. 
 I'll have to ask my lawyer. No kayak exception. 
 But we will allow a stipend in the case of divorce that doubles your current expense. 
 But only if Sweeney doesn't die under suspicious circumstances. 
 Do we have an agreement? 
 Okay. 
 [GROANS] Mm. 
 This, uh, bullshit case against me, the Foreign, uh... 
 Corrupt Practices? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I want you to do it. You're fired. 
 Go. 
 Hello, ladies. Mr. Lester, it's good to see you. 
 I think you know Liz Reddick. We've had dealings. 
 No hard feelings, I hope. Water under the bridge. 
 Good. I've done things in my life I'm not proud of. 
 But I want you to know I've turned over a new leaf. It's a new me. 
 Good to know. 
 Uh, so what can we do for you, Mr. Lester? 
 Very simply, we don't need our files sent anywhere. 
 We think we acted too harshly. We're staying. 
 Come on, don't play hard-to-get. We have a lot of business here. 
 You're right. Thank Mr. Bishop for staying loyal. 
 We have a bright future in front of us. How could we not? Great to see you all. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, it's part of being a defense attorney. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Are you going to the hospital? Oh, yeah. 
 You too? Yes. I'll drive. 
 Okay.
