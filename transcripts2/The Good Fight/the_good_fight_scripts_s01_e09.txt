 [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PHONE RINGS] 
 Any last-minute advice? 
 No. Just tell the truth. 
 Anything you admit here can't be used against you so take advantage of that. Hm. 
 Was your first year anything like this? 
 No. 
 But, my guess is, my fourth year will be. Things are getting weirder. 
 They are, aren't they? It's the world. 
 You're weathering it well. 
 Thanks. 
 [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] 
 You can go in now. 
 Breathe and smile. 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 Come on! 
 I brought my client in for a voluntary interview, not a group interrogation. 
 Hi! That's not for you. We're in here. 
 [CHUCKLES] Come on. They won't bite. 
 Ha-ha-ha. Let 'em through, guys. 
 Hi. Sorry, they're painting in the hallway, and the only way in is through the sixth degree room. 
 So, sorry about that. Um... Hi, I'm Lucca Quinn. 
 Hi. This is my client Maia Rindell. 
 Hi. Yeah, I know. The NSA sent over some of your e-mails. 
 Ha-ha! It's a joke. I'm punchy today. 
 I'm Federal Agent Madeline Starky and, uh... why don't we have a seat and chat? 
 Uh. 
 Oh. 
 [CLATTERING] 
 There you go. Thank you. 
 I'm out of breath. 
 Ah. So, Maia, thank you so much for coming today. 
 Um... we really appreciate your help with this investigation. 
 I know this has not been easy on you. 
 You understand Maia is here under the terms of the proffer from the US Attorney's Office? 
 Absolutely, this is your queen-for-a-day session. Yes. 
 Nothing my client says can be used against her. 
 If she answers truthfully, that is correct, and I know you will, because it's a felony to lie to a, um... federal agent. 
 18 USC 1001. Wow, that's exactly right. 
 So, you understand that the proffer doesn't immunise you from perjury? 
 I do. Great. Good! So, here we are. 
 [BIRD SQUAWKS, THUDS] Ooh! My, gosh. 
 You see, what happened there is, the light hits the window, you know, in a particular way, and the birds fly right into it. 
 Sad, really. 
 [SLURPS DRINK] 
 OK, um... I am going to take some notes, if that's all right with counsel? Go for it. 
 Maia, let's talk about your parents. 
 How did this Ponzi scheme begin? 
 Maia doesn't know how this Ponzi scheme began. 
 Oh, right, right, my apologies. 
 Um... let me be a little more discursive. 
 Let's look at this as remembrance of Ponzi schemes past, huh? 
 And, um... anything that comes into your mind about your parents or your Uncle Jackson, you just spill it. 
 OK? And I'll just sit here and I'll write it down. 
 [BIRD SQUAWKS, THUDS] 
 [DOORS PING] [PHONE RINGS] 
 Diane. I need you. 
 We got a call from the courthouse, another brutality case. 
 Now? 
 Guess who the cop is. I'm bad at this, Adrian. 
 Andrew Theroux. Seriously? 
 Seriously. The case that brought us together, hm? 
 See, he stops a motorist for expired tags, kicks him in the head. 
 How do you know this? I got somebody down at County. 
 I pay him $300 if he gives me a heads-up on brutality cases so we can get this dirty cop off the Force once and for all. 
 Morning. Morning. What do we got? 
 This is one of the worst I've seen in a while. 
 Anybody else seen him? Uh... family members? Lawyers? Anybody? 
 No. Theroux brought his load in last night. He's all yours. 
 Good. Give us a half-hour with him. 
 Are you my lawyers? DIANE: We hope to be, Mr... 
 Newson. Todd Newson. 
 Look, I didn't do it. The cop just searched my car. 
 When was this? Last night. Uh... about midnight. 
 It looks like they, uh... cleaned up your injuries pretty good. 
 Where did he kick you? 
 Should I say he kicked me? 
 What are you in for, son? Possession. 
 MAN: Guard! Ugh! Where are the handy wipes? 
 [TOILET FLUSHES] I need my Purell! 
 This is abuse. Oh, dear God. 
 Diane Lockhart. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Did Alicia call you? She said she couldn't take my case. 
 Uh... no. So, you're the brutality victim? 
 Isn't it terrible? I... Look at this. Hm? Hm? 
 Do you have any idea how hard it is to get blood out of Egyptian cotton? 
 Oh! 
 And now no Purell! 
 I was driving down 290, at around two in the morning, with Naftali. 
 Who's that? A... a friend. Adventurous. 
 Israeli. Her father was a general. 
 Don't get her started on the Six-Day War. 
 She loves seeing me in pain. 
 The bruises on your face, how do we know those aren't from Naftali? 
 No, Naftali knows never to hit me in the face. 
 Only the back and the thighs. 
 So, you have bruises on your back and your thighs? 
 Mm, slight bruises. Mostly scratches. 
 What that woman can do with the end of a paperclip... 
 I know I'm not a good witness. 
 Talk to her. Naftali Amado. 
 She'll say exactly what I said. OK. 
 They're out to get me, the same way they did with Rodney King. 
 We've got a lot in common, he and I. 
 Can't we all just get along? 
 [DOOR BUZZES] 
 What do you think? Oh, he's the Devil. 
 Ha-ha! And, unfortunately, the Devil is our best chance to get Theroux kicked off the Force. 
 Uh... 
 Um... 
 I'm not sure how to start. Well, here, let's try this. 
 From our forensic accounting, the first criminal act, the first one where new funds were used to pay off old debts, was... 
 September 15th 2008. 
 Any thoughts? That was a long time ago. 
 Um... 2008? Mm. 
 I would have been 17. 
 Do you remember what you were doing? 
 I was probably in school. 
 Well, it was the day Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Does that help? 
 MAN: Breaking news. Stocks all around the globe are in a free fall at this point... 
 HENRY: Holy God! 
 The Dow expected to open down... 
 Oh, my God! What? ...over 300 points as fears of a... 
 Anything you remember could help. 
 If you're not sure of a memory, just say you're not sure. 
 This is not an isolated event. Oh, God! What are we gonna say? 
 What are we gonna do? Stop! Stop it! 
 You have to get Jax. I've been all day making calls. 
 MADELINE: Maia, do you recognise this name? 
 Michael Hannigan. He was an investor in your parents' fund. 
 Yes. 
 And he was at your house on September 15th? 
 Yes. OK. 
 And your parents spoke with him? Yes. 
 Jax was there too. 
 Um... my Uncle Jax, he was there and... and spoke to him. 
 To Hannigan? You're sure? 
 This is temporary, Mike. 
 You pull your money out now, you're out eight mill... 
 Yes. Yeah, my mom, she, uh... she called Jax and he came over to tell Mike Hannigan that if he pulled his money from the fund, then he would be out something like eight million dollars and the best course was to keep his money in. 
 And what time did Jax come by? 
 I was still doing my homework, uh... so... probably about four in the afternoon. 
 OK, and how long was he there? 
 I think two hours, because he was... he was gone before dinner. 
 MADELINE: And you had dinner with your parents? 
 You can't always be promising 12 per cent. 
 Well, it's not about what we prom... 
 Yes. Good. 
 Now, here's the problem, Maia. 
 I have your mother's computer calendar, and, uh... 
 Pardon me. I'm still a bit of a Luddite. 
 I need it printed out and, uh... 
 Luddite. God, I hate that word, don't you? 
 I don't think I have an opinion. It's like meme. 
 It's one of those words that makes the English language so ugly. 
 The calendar? Yes. 
 So, on this day, your mother says you had a gynaecologist appointment at 3pm, uh... with a Dr Regina. 
 So, here's the problem. 
 I'm not sure how you could have seen your Uncle Jax at your house at 4pm, when you were at a doctor's appointment at 3pm. 
 Excuse me. You're asking about something that happened nine years ago. 
 I know. Look, I'm on your side in this. 
 I know that memory can be faulty. I'm just trying to get to the truth. 
 Maia. Were you there at the doctor's appointment? 
 Iwas. Uh... maybe I... I saw Jax and Mr Hannigan later. 
 Or another day maybe? 
 No, no, I don't think so. It... it was on that day. 
 Well, here's the problem. 
 The distance between Dr Regina's office and your house is 12.4 miles and there was very heavy traffic that day. 
 How do we know that? My minions, my FBI minions. 
 They know everything and they give me hard copies. 
 So, by the time you would get home with your mother, it would have been 5:30 and your housekeeper said she served you dinner right at 5:30. 
 What did Jax say? 
 Jax says he was never at your house at all. 
 That is not true. He was there. But you can't remember when? 
 No. No, but I... I remember that he was there. 
 You know, when I was, um... about eight, I was on Bozo's Circus and you're too young to remember this, but it was a really big deal. 
 I was sitting in the audience with my mom, and I was chosen for the grand prize game, which is another very big deal, and I remember as I got that ball into bucket number six, and the confetti was all over the place, the crowd was roaring, and last year, my mother showed me some pictures from that day. 
 I wasn't on The Bozo Show. My older sister was. 
 See, the mind has an odd way of turning wishful thinking into actual memories. 
 OK. I think we should take a pause there. I want to confer with my client. 
 Oh, absolutely. Please. And remember, this is queen-for-a-day. 
 So, no gotcha questions here. 
 MAN: Go around! Go around! 
 Painters. Sorry. Just go out that door, door you came. 
 [CHATTER STOPS] 
 Uh... sorry. We're just, uh... 
 There's the painters, so... 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 OK, here's my advice. She is not your friend. 
 She's trying to catch you in lies. I'm not lying. 
 I understand. I know you're trying to protect your parents, but she can see you doing that. 
 So, don't talk about Jax being with Hannigan unless you have a specific memory. 
 I don't want to hurt my dad. 
 I know. But your proffer only covers you if you don't lie. 
 If you lie to protect your dad, you might get him off. 
 But you'll end up in jail. 
 All rise! The Honourable Don Linden presiding. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 No, Steve, I have it. 
 [GRUNTS] No. 
 [PANTS] 
 OK. 
 Oh! Well, I guess I won that bet. 
 Mr Sweeney. How nice of you to join us again. 
 I am an innocent man, Your Honour. 
 Your Honour, our client has very deep roots in his community. 
 And a private jet on standby at O'Hare. What is the charge? 
 Resisting arrest. No, aggravated battery. 
 Wait, what? Your Honour, this is a misdemeanour. 
 No, a felony. 
 Mr Sweeney struck out at the officer, striking him in the head and face. 
 This is gross overcharging. All lives matter... 
 Don't get cute, sir. Shut up, Colin. I'm finally on your side. 
 ADRIAN: Your Honour, we ask that Mr Sweeney be released on his own recognisance. 
 He's a victim of overzealous prosecution. 
 He all but has a target on his back, Your Honour. 
 Gee, I wonder why. 
 Bail is set at three million dollars. Next. 
 Attica! Attica! DIANE: [WHISPERING] Shut up. 
 You're smiling. Why? 
 Felony, aggravated battery, against a police officer. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 We can put Theroux on the stand? 
 Yep. If they kept it to a misdemeanour, we couldn't. 
 So, Colin Sweeney is gonna do his one good deed, get a dirty cop kicked off the Force. 
 Boo-ya! [BOTH LAUGH] 
 [SLURPS DRINK] 
 [BIRD SQUAWKS, THUDS] 
 Yep, you missed an entire flock. [LAUGHS] Did you two get everything settled? 
 There was nothing to settle. But we talked and we're back. 
 Good. 
 So, Maia, I want you to take a look at your mother's calendar, OK? 
 You'll see that you two have a few appointments listed over the years and not just the gyno. You see? 
 For example, on October 3rd, you had another appointment with Dr Regina and, uh... then, on October 23rd, you went with your mother to her dental checkup, and on November 4th, the two of you went to see a movie. 
 Do you remember what you saw? No. 
 Why don't you take a good look at that and put a check mark next to the ones that you remember? 
 Well, the worry is not STD... 
 Maia has a boyfriend. 
 What can I do to help, Doctor? 
 Thank you. So you and your mom were together at these times? 
 Yes. 
 As far as I remember, yes. 
 OK. Well, here's the problem. 
 It would be easier if you would just tell us a problem before there is a problem. 
 Your mother wasn't with you at these appointments. 
 What do you mean? 
 That's when she was off sleeping with your Uncle Jax. 
 She used as an excuse these appointments in her calendar so she could meet with your Uncle Jax at his home. 
 Maia had no way to know that. 
 Yes, but just because her mother has it in her calendar doesn't mean it's true and Maia shouldn't confirm it if it's not true. 
 Some of those dates are true. None of these dates are true, Maia. 
 Every two weeks, your mother met with your Uncle Jax at his home. 
 Since 2008. 
 Is it possible that your mother is working with your Uncle Jax to set up your dad? 
 My client cannot answer that. ‘Cause here's the problem, Maia. 
 You were used as a cover so your mother could sleep with your uncle for several years. 
 You didn't suspect anything? 
 [LENORE AND JAX LAUGH] 
 No. 
 MADELINE: OK, and in that same time frame, did you ever suspect your parents of their Ponzi scheme? 
 I think we should take a break for lunch at this point. 
 I'd like to go for a few more hours. No. Let's take a break. 
 MADELINE: Sure, if you insist. 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 [SNORING] 
 [SNORTS] 
 Nat, you need to get some sleep. Yeah, what do you think I'm doing? 
 We have another client who was brutalised by a cop. 
 You do know I work for COPA, not for you? 
 Civilian Office of Police Accountability. 
 Just in case you haven't noticed, we are civilians. 
 You're not civilians, you're parasites. 
 It was during a routine traffic stop, Nat. 
 You'll want to write this down. Guess who the cop is. 
 Andrew Theroux. 
 And when... when was this? Last night. 
 You're bringing a suit? Yep, another six million. 
 Who's the victim? 
 Every citizen deserves equal protection under the law. 
 Who's the victim? Just give him a chance. 
 Adrian? 
 Colin Sweeney. 
 ADRIAN: All right. OK, OK. [LAUGHS] 
 The cops have been following this guy around, looking for some kind of payback, man. 
 He dragged him out of the car and kicked him in the head. 
 COPA has to investigate. ADRIAN: It's not about Sweeney. 
 It's about getting this piece of sh1t off the Force. 
 Come on, come to court. We're gonna put Theroux on the stand. 
 All want is an open mind. Come on. [CONTINUES LAUGHING] 
 That was Internal Affairs? 
 That was COPA and they're not gonna investigate. 
 Destroy Theroux on the stand. He'll be back. 
 At first he was agitated. 
 Then he got belligerent. It seemed to me that he was on drugs. 
 I haven't used drugs in 20 years. Shh. 
 Whisper quieter, Mr Sweeney. I can hear you up here. 
 Sorry, Your Honour. 
 I think my eardrum is damaged from when the officer hit me last night. 
 Objection, Your Honour. Sustained. Shut up, Mr Sweeney. 
 And how did you react to his struggle, Officer? 
 I tried to use only as much force as was necessary to gain his compliance. 
 Unfortunately, he chose to attack me, and, I'm sorry to say, did some damage. 
 These bruises here and here? Yes, sir. 
 If 1 did that, don't you think I'd have some marks on my hands? 
 THEROUX: I'll need some corrective surgery to reset my teeth. 
 Jay, it's Diane. I just forwarded you a picture of Theroux's injuries. 
 I never thought I'd say this, but I think there's a chance Colin Sweeney is telling the truth. 
 Maia. We're back in. 
 Hi! Well, I hope you both had a nice lunch. 
 I'd like to keep this under three hours. 
 Certainly. See's? No, thank you. 
 See's? No. 
 My husband picked out all the good stuff. 
 What's your husband's name? 
 Uh... Mic... Michael... son. Why? 
 How long have you two been married? 
 I Googled you over lunch. You're not married. 
 Ah. Hm. 
 You got me. 
 You were also instrumental in the convictions of Blagojevich and George Ryan. 
 Did the folksy thing work on them too? 
 Well, there was one lawyer in one of the cases, and I'm not gonna say who. 
 We weren't interested in his client. 
 We only asked him to come in for a how-do-you-do meeting. 
 Uh... but this lawyer was so aggressive and so suspicious that we decided to probe further into his client and that client is now in prison. 
 Sweet story. It's a true one. 
 Are you advising me not to represent my client? 
 Far from it. 
 I think it would benefit both of us if Maia were to offer all she knows. 
 Undiluted. 
 What do you need, Miss Starky? 
 Well, I'd like to turn to the Foundation, the Rindell Foundation. 
 You're one of three board members? Uh... yes. 
 And you... When was the last time the board met? 
 Uh... I don't know. Um... a few years ago? 
 If you have the answer, you can just tell her. 
 Well, uh... well, I think the last board meeting, and only board meeting, was June 18th 2011. 
 Do you know of any other dates? No. 
 OK. That doesn't bother you? Tell me what you mean. 
 Well, it's a foundation with 65 million in assets and you only met once? 
 Well, the foundation wasn't my idea. 
 Uh, it was... It was your parents'. Yeah. 
 Yes, but it was for a good cause, for malaria prevention in Africa. 
 Oh, and how much did you spend on prevention? 
 Yeah, but I just want to know how much we're sending. 
 Well, honey. You know, it's a lot, uh... honey. We're not skimping. 
 [HARRY LAUGHS] 
 I don't know. 
 That's OK, Maia. You were just a figurehead. 
 That's not a bad thing. You're not in trouble. 
 Yeah, but, Dad, I mean, it's got my name on it. I have to know. 
 Um... OK, I'll... I'll have Jax open the books to you. 
 Just give us a few weeks. OK. 
 MADELINE: Do you need a moment? 
 No. 
 So, let's talk about the day the foundation was formed. 
 You get it? Right here. 
 Affidavits? Here. 
 You just saved his ass. Thank you, Jay. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Good to know. 
 Hello, Officer Theroux. Hello. 
 This is a familiar spot for you, being questioned about police brutality. 
 Objection. Argumentative and rude. 
 Sustained to the first. Overruled to the second. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 DIANE: Officer, um... do you work out at Savoy's Gym? 
 Uh... yes. Why? 
 Do you recall, yesterday afternoon, sparring with a 19-year-old welterweight named Hector Peraza, who, according to eyewitnesses, knocked you out? 
 That's bullshit. He didn't knock me out. 
 My apologies. But you sparred with him? Yeah, I held my own. 
 This was before you went on duty? Yes. Why? 
 DIANE: Isn't it possible that these bruises here are the result of punches thrown by Hector Peraza? No. 
 Well, these are photos of cuts and lacerations inside your mouth, Officer Theroux. Objection. Not in evidence. 
 These are police photos, Your Honour. We didn't take them. 
 Unless you want to throw out all your photos, Mr ASA, overruled. 
 Do you see these lacerations, Officer Theroux? 
 Those lacerations are in the same shape as this. 
 The mouth guard at Savoy's Gym. 
 You guys are good. 
 ALL: ♪ Happy birthday to you 
 ♪ Happy birthday to you... 
 MADELINE: So, this was your 18th birthday? 
 Yes. [CLEARS THROAT] 
 And that's when your parents gifted you the Rindell Foundation? 
 Uh... yes. 
 My parents, they knew I was interested in Africa. 
 I had read that malaria kills one million kids a year and that it could be prevented with mosquito netting. 
 So, they wanted me to run an effort to pay for the netting for, uh... 60 per cent of African children. 
 Wow. Well, that is a good cause. Thank you so much for doing that. 
 Can I ask you who else was at your party? 
 Uh... a lot of people. 
 How about your girlfriend, uh... Amy Breslin? 
 Yes, she was there. 
 But she wasn't my girlfriend at the time. 
 Uncle Jax introduced us. She was just entering law school. 
 And your boyfriend was there too? 
 I have to get back. 
 MADELINE: Maia, was he there? 
 Yes. OK. That's not complicated. [CHUCKLES] 
 OK. And Diane Lockhart, was she there? 
 [NO AUDIO] 
 Yes, she was there too. 
 Are you sure you don't want one? They're delicious. 
 From your husband? [CHUCKLES] OK. 
 Now, did you hear Miss Lockhart offer any legal advice to your parents? 
 OK, I'm gonna stop you. This is not material covered by the proffer. 
 Anything that has to do with the Ponzi scheme is covered by the proffer. 
 Hearsay conversations which may be subject to attorney-client privilege... 
 Actually, my current case is a homicide. 
 My client is accused of killing a mutual fund manager who worked with Bernie Madoff. Ooh. Really? 
 Do you know him? Bernie? 
 DIANE: Mm. No. Do we, Lenore? Maybe Jax. 
 MADELINE: All I'm asking is if she has a memory. 
 LUCCA: That's not what I'm saying. This is a fishing expedition... 
 I have to get back. 
 Call me. MADELINE: Wait, wait, wait. 
 If she has a memory, I will hear it. This is a fishing expedition... 
 Lenore, do you think that Ruth Madoff knew what her husband was doing? 
 Oh. 
 No. Why? I think she didn't want to know. 
 No. [EXHALES] 
 DIANE: How could she not know? 
 LUCCA: You are digging. No, hold on just a sec. 
 Here's the problem, Miss Quinn. 
 We have a lot of problems here, don't we? 
 These foundation documents were signed by Maia, and she signed them, she just admitted, on the night of her birthday party, her 18th birthday. 
 So she is responsible for any crimes committed by this foundation. 
 LUCCA: Our proffer is about Maia's involvement with this fund, not Diane Lockhart's advice. 
 MADELINE: I hate to be the bad guy here, but millions of dollars were being parked into that foundation to hide them from an SEC audit. 
 That is a felony crime. 
 Now, unless Maia tells us about Diane Lockhart's advice to her parents, we will stop this questioning now and prosecute. 
 I need to be 18 for those documents to be official? 
 Yes, and you were. You signed them on your 18th birthday. 
 We had my birthday party on a Saturday and, well, I didn't turn 18 until the following Tuesday. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You know, maybe I will have one of those candies. 
 Nice try, Agent. 
 Is this the kind of finesse you used on Blagojevich? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Nice, Maia. Lucky. 
 No, I've seen lucky. That was smart. 
 I have another witness, Your Honour. Naftali Amado. 
 You said she was on your side. She is. She was. 
 Naftali. 
 Hello, Miss Amado. Hello, man. 
 You were with Mr Sweeney when his car was pulled over, isn't that correct? 
 Ken. We speak English here. 
 Ah. Yes. Hebrew makes me so hot. 
 What happened after you were pulled over? 
 The policeman, he comes over to us. 
 He says, uh... we need to show the... erm... erm... the... lice...? Licence? 
 Yes. But, uh... Mr Sweeney is very, very... hot. 
 He gets out of the car, punches the policeman. 
 Oh, that is outrageous. You are outrageous. 
 You li... You sit back down. 
 
 
 
 Excuse me, ma'am. That is my job. 
 Please, Mr Sweeney. Any more questions, counsellor? 
 Nothing further. 
 Ah! Painting's done. You can come in this way now. 
 Mm. Here you go. 
 Have a seat. 
 I'd like to apologise for the uncomfortableness... 
 [CHUCKLES] ...earlier this afternoon. 
 It was all on me. My bad. I'm sorry. 
 I don't want things to be tense between us. 
 We don't either. Good. So we're friends again? 
 Sure. [CHUCKLES] OK, good. 
 Maia, um... let's talk about when you did become aware of the Ponzi scheme. 
 You said it was when the press reported on it? 
 Yes. [BIRD SQUAWKS, THUDS] 
 And not before? Uh... that is correct. 
 You graduated from law school in 2016, right? 
 Yes. Was it a big day? 
 I don't understand. 
 Well, there was a celebration at your parents' house. 
 HENRY: To a fantastic year! Whoa! 
 Yes, there was. 
 Your parents were there? Amy's parents were there? 
 LENORE: Oh, thank you for being here. 
 Yes, Sam and Connie. OK. Sam and Connie. 
 Were you living with Amy at the time when you graduated from law school? 
 I was. 
 Did Amy ever ask you about the possibility of her parents investing in your parents' fund? 
 She asked about it and I told her that to start an account, it... it was a minimum of $200,000. 
 Her parents didn't have that kind of money. 
 According to my information, and I could be wrong, your parents did make exceptions to that requirement. 
 Is that a question? No, this is one: 
 Did you ever ask if an exception could be made in the case of Amy's parents? 
 Oh. Ugh. 
 ADRIAN: Just... 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Why would she lie? I don't know. 
 She's such a naughty minx. It could be her idea of a joke. 
 Mr Sweeney, please take this seriously. 
 I imagine a felony arrest for drug possession could get her deported. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Who are you again? A partner here. 
 Where does the drug possession come in? 
 There was nothing in the crime report. 
 Well, partner, I'm just theorising here. 
 But we were on our way to a chemsex party in Arlington Heights. 
 Mm-mm. Wait, wait. We need to stop right there. 
 You need to speak in hypotheticals. But why? 
 We can't put you on the stand, knowing you will perjure yourself. 
 You can only relate something that is true or potentially true. 
 God, I love the law and everybody takes it so seriously. 
 Your party? Yes, chemsex. 
 Chemse... No? 
 Oh! Drug cocktails then s*x. Oh, most enlightening. 
 Hypothetically. SWEENEY: Yes. 
 Naftali and I were hypothetically on our way to this party, where we were hypothetically going to supply the synthetic cathinone. 
 Then why was there no mention of drugs in the police report? 
 Naftali threw them out the window when we were stopped. 
 Uh... hypothetically. 
 Adrian? 
 I think we're in trouble. 
 I was scanning police calls, following Theroux's movements. 
 He was calling for some K-9 Units to the scene of the pullover. 
 f*ck. They found them. 
 Yeah. What are you gonna do? I don't know. 
 When the facts are on your side, you pound the facts. 
 When the facts are not on your side... 
 Come on! Are you kidding me?! Counsellor! 
 Sit down right now. You'll get your turn. Continue, Mr ASA. 
 Again, Officer Theroux, did you conduct a search this morning in an area adjacent to the Dan Ryan Expressway? 
 1 did. And what occasioned that search? 
 The night before, I witnessed an object being thrown from the suspect's car... 
 Come on! Why did he not search the night before, Your Honour? 
 This is bullshit! 
 Sir, you will stop right now, or we will discuss contempt charges. 
 Go ahead. Well, that is a good question. 
 Why didn't you search the area the night before? 
 THEROUX: I did, but there is thick brush there and a gully. 
 I couldn't find anything so I went back with a K-9 Unit this morning. 
 Talk about a convenient memory! Ma'am. No. 
 Thank you, Your Honour. Please. 
 Tell the court what, if anything, you found. 
 A white plastic bag, containing approximately 1.5 grams of a synthetic cathinone commonly known as bath salts. 
 Nothing further. 
 Why aren't they introducing the dashboard cam into evidence? 
 Mr Boseman, Miss Lockhart, are you both done pounding your table? 
 ADRIAN: I apologise, Your Honour. 
 But given the significance of the officer's new testimony, I'm curious why we're not seeing his dashboard video of the encounter. 
 JUDGE: Good question. Mr ASA? 
 Your Honour, there's nothing exculpatory on that recording. 
 ADRIAN: That's a relief. 
 My guess is you would like to see it. If it's not too much trouble. 
 JUDGE: The State has three hours to provide defence with the video. 
 Adjourned. [GAVEL BANGS] 
 [SIREN WAILS] [MAN TALKS ON POLICE RADIO] 
 [SIREN WAILS] [MAN TALKS ON POLICE RADIO] 
 [WOMAN TALKS ON POLICE RADIO] 
 [MAN AND WOMAN TALK ON POLICE RADIO] 
 [TAPS KEYS] 
 Huh. 
 Huh. 
 You want a rental, you gotta talk to the office. 
 No, I need a name. Last night, you drove someone. 
 A man in a suit. 
 This man. 
 [SCOFFS] What did he do? Nothing. 
 He's a witness to a car accident. 
 Richard Hess. 
 Where was he headed? Some party in Arlington Heights. 
 How are you, Rich? 
 Do I know you? 
 I don't think we've officially met but I know you know Colin Sweeney and I think he may need you to testify on his behalf. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Come on, man. He was leading you to a party in Arlington Heights, the chemsex party, but his car got pulled over. 
 This is you on the dashboard videotape. 
 You waited a few minutes for them but then told the driver to keep going. 
 Since you're obviously a little dense, let me dumb it down for you. 
 f*ck off. 
 This guy definitely saw something but he won't testify. 
 Can we pay him? Hypothetically. Mr Sweeney. 
 We can treat him as a hostile witness. 
 Why won't he testify? 
 He doesn't want it to come out, where he was going. 
 And where was that? 
 JAY: The s*x party Mr Sweeney was going to. 
 What's his name? Richard Hess. 
 Why? you know him? No. 
 You will not put him on the stand. You have no right. 
 He saw what happened. You don't know that. 
 I insist that you not contact him again or I'm hiring other lawyers. 
 So, you did beat up that cop? No. What? No. 
 Why don't you want us to get this guy? I don't need a reason. 
 I'll be in your office, Diane. 
 I think I understand. What? I don't. 
 Richard Hess is a Florida real estate billionaire, who's been sent to Chicago to vet ambassadors. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Oh, don't act like that. 
 What's the point of being rich if you can't buy what's for sale? 
 An ambassadorship? 
 I gave over a million dollars to his campaign PAC. 
 Membership has its privileges. 
 So, work your magic and make these charges go away. 
 I need to look clean. Then get Hess to testify on your behalf. 
 This drug testimony from Theroux hurts you. 
 No. Find another way. 
 Police brutality is your speciality and I'm a bona fide victim here. 
 It's not just the black people who get brutalised. 
 Uh... it's people like me, the misunderstood. 
 The white billionaire wife-killer, allegedly. 
 Oh, God. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Maia. 
 She's trying to suggest you knew about the Ponzi scheme, and you waived Amy's parents off. Yeah, I know. 
 Did you? No. 
 You don't sound definite. 
 Did you tell him my father's IRA comes to 110,000, that he's got another 30,000 in T-bills? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I don't know. I... 
 You don't know if you waived Amy's parents off? 
 I know this has been hard. 
 I know these months have been hard on you, and you feel, rightly or wrongly, guilty for your parents' actions. 
 No, that's not what this is. 
 You don't even need to be conscious of it, Maia. 
 Your guilt could just be colouring your memories. 
 You could be seeing yourself as more culpable than you are. 
 It's your Catholic guilt. 
 You are condemning yourself. 
 That's fine for the confessional, but here it has real repercussions. 
 They could put you in jail. 
 Your father would really turn down $140,000? 
 Well, he does it all the time. 
 Did you really tell your dad? 
 Lucca, I didn't tell my dad. 
 Didn't tell him what? 
 About Amy's parents' investment. 
 I pretended to, but I never told him. 
 What do you mean? Of course I told my dad. Why wouldn't I? 
 OK, this isn't good. You're ready to admit you killed Biggie. 
 I must have somehow known about the Ponzi scheme. 
 Otherwise why wouldn't I have let Amy's parents invest? 
 That doesn't mean anything. It does, Lucca. 
 I knew. 
 The problem is the drugs. The Judge was listening to us on everything else. 
 It's the drugs thrown out the freaking window. 
 So, we use Hess. We convince Sweeney, he has to use his vetter. 
 No, we need to go at the drugs, Diane. That helps us with COPA too. 
 They want to kick Theroux off the Force. We just... 
 [EXHALES] We haven't given them enough of a reason to do it. 
 Then we're stuck. 
 Diane? You happy here? 
 What, at your firm? Yeah. 
 Yes. Why? I don't know. You wanted to retire. 
 [LAUGHS] Yes. 
 Well, life has a way of reminding you of who you are. 
 Mm. 
 Guess I'm not the retiring type. 
 Are you happy here? 
 [LAUGHS] Gotcha. 
 I like getting the better of people, and... keeping something alive. 
 You know? Look out there, all those employees, and realising they might not have jobs if I don't keep this going. 
 Yeah, that is a good feeling. 
 OK. Time to go home. 
 Let's get dinner some time. 
 OK? That would be nice. 
 Mm. 
 Possession. It was possession! Stupid! 
 What? 
 I am so stupid. It was right there in front of our eyes. 
 What was? What was his name? Uh... 
 Oh! -Umm... 
 Todd Newson. 
 Are you familiar with Officer Andrew Theroux, Mr Newson? 
 Oh, yeah. He's the one that pulled me over a few nights ago. 
 What happened? 
 I was driving home from my mom's house. He pulled me over. 
 Said I was switching lanes without signalling. I wasn't. 
 He asked me to step out of the car so he could search it. 
 Then he handcuffs me and says I'm under arrest for possession of heroin. 
 Were you in possession of heroin? No, he planted it. 
 ADRIAN: In fact, weren't the charges eventually dropped? 
 Yeah, just today. The other cops say this happens a lot with him. 
 Objection, Your Honour. Yes, sustained. 
 But you might want to reconsider your charge here, Mr ASA. 
 Nothing further, Your Honour. Thank you. 
 Mr McGrath? Nothing further. 
 The witness is dismissed. 
 Hey. Thanks. 
 Uh... 
 It's really not necessary. 
 HENRY: It's no big deal. JAX: It's an SEC audit. 
 Of course it's a big deal. 
 Would you two be quiet? 
 Hey, hon. We'll be right out. 
 I don't think we should entangle your parents' money with my parents'. 
 Is there something wrong with the fund? 
 Are you good? 
 I don't know. 
 Listen, Maia, I can think of a dozen reasons why you didn't let Amy's parents invest. 
 First and foremost, you didn't want to mix up finances with love. 
 That makes complete sense to me. 
 You think so? Yeah, I do. 
 [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] 
 You ready again? Last tennis visit. 
 [CHUCKLES] J-K. 
 That's "just kidding". It's what the kids say. 
 [KNOCKING] I wanted to thank you for your help. 
 You're welcome. 
 And I wanted to let you know that no good deed goes unpunished. 
 About an hour ago, some billionaire was named the next ambassador to Germany. 
 I lost it. I'm sorry to hear that. 
 I can't believe I wasted four months trying to learn German. 
 Ich nicht. 
 Well, I'm sure you'll survive. 
 Also, it'll free you up for our lawsuit against Cook County. 
 Thoreaux's been kicked off the Force, but we've got a six million dollar civil suit in the works. 
 Uh... no, I'm not doing that. 
 Uh... yes, you are. No, sorry. 
 I'm trying for Ambassador to the Vatican. 
 Again, thanks. 
 I'll drop by again. 
 Are you ready to finish this up, Maia? 
 She is. 
 You asked me why I didn't want Amy's parents to invest in the fund, and, the truth is, it just seemed like a bad idea to mix family and finances. 
 In my experience, Maia, whenever somebody says "the truth is", that usually means it's not. 
 That's not... I like you, Maia. 
 I think you're smart, I think you're perceptive, and I think you committed a crime here. 
 I think you knew about your parents' Ponzi scheme and I'm going to recommend prosecution by the US Attorney's Office. 
 This was a proffer session. Yes. But she lied. 
 I'm sorry.
