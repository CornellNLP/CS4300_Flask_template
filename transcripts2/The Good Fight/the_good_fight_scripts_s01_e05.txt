 [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] 
 WOMAN: Can you show me on this doll where he touched you? 
 GIRL: /t was everywhere. It was... 
 1 didn't do it. She's lying. 
 WOMAN: We still need to answer the subpoena. 
 Yeah, well, I have the answer. "Go to hell." 
 1 didn't rape anyone. 1 didn't molest anyone. 
 It just makes me sick. 
 It's this campaign. They think they can say anything about me and make it stick. 
 So are we the anti-Trump firm now? That's not what this is about. 
 That's a First Amendment issue. How is it a First Amendment issue? 
 We're talking about a TV network, not the US government. 
 That is not a First Amendment issue. 
 The Trump administration is pressuring the TV network. 
 That makes it a First Amendment issue, Julius. 
 We're talking about a network that shot an episode and chose not to air it. 
 You voted for the man. Oh, there it is! 
 There he is. The black man who voted for Trump. 
 You voted for him, not me. Wait, gentlemen, please. 
 The only question before us is whether we take this case. 
 Uh, I'm sorry. What is the case? 
 A writer I know is on one of those Chicago shows. 
 He wrote a ripped-from-the-headline episode about Donald Trump. 
 A fictional Trump. It's based on the accusation that he raped a 13-year-old. 
 Whoa, whoa. There was no accusation. The lawsuit was dropped. 
 And the accuser never even let her name go public. 
 Because she didn't wanna go up against the president, the same president... 
 If it was Obama or Clinton, you would have been fine with that. 
 Can we please stay on topic? Anti-disabled people, anti-women... 
 The network delayed the broadcast, so the writer put it online. 
 And the network is suing for theft? 
 Yes, for $12 million. Ooh. 
 He was afraid they weren't going to show the episode due to their fear of the president. 
 He's lost his lawyer, so he's asking us to represent him. 
 Hello! This is not about politics. 
 I know that. Tell him. What's your strategy? 
 You can't argue against the theft. He's proud of his crime. 
 I'm not saying we should argue against theft. 
 Julius, Julius, I'm saying we should use the whistleblower laws. 
 Mm-mm, Adrian. He was not fired. 
 Exactly. He wasn't fired, Adrian. What's your legal strategy? 
 If we take this case, you need to argue something. 
 Try fair use. 
 In what way, Diane? 
 Copyright material may be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism. 
 That's criticism. 
 Our client is quoting the work to show the chilling effect on his network. 
 People, it's good. It's good. 
 Adrian, do you have a minute? 
 OK, why are we doing this? 
 Chicago TV production. It's blowing up, Barbara. 
 And there'll be even more tax breaks next year. 
 You wanna expand into entertainment. 
 I wanna put us on the map more strongly as a Chicago firm that handles local cases. 
 Then why isn't it a mistake to go up against the studios, especially on a case we're gonna lose? 
 It's an audition. We show their lawyers we can give ‘em a run for their money. 
 My guess, they'd much rather have us inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in. 
 Uh, we need to talk to Diane today. 
 Hey, can that wait a week? Not if we wanna be consistent. 
 We've always insisted that equity partners have the capital contribution within a month. 
 OK, I need you to do it. 
 How come I always have to do all the dirty work and you get to go and have fun in court? 
 ‘Cause you're so good at the dirty work. 
 I hate when you disguise curses as compliments. 
 I'm going to court. Mm-hm. 
 Maia Rindell, please. 
 This article is completely false. It is untrue. 
 So you bought the jewellery before your parents' Ponzi scheme? 
 No. I never bought the jewellery. 
 Was it a gift? 
 No. There is no jewellery. This article is false. 
 It quotes witnesses. 
 Here, it says the owner of Madame Rudolph's Antique Jewellery said they sold you ten pieces? 
 And that is made up. Did you try calling the store? 
 So you're saying there is no Dolly Rudolph, proprietor of Madame Rudolph's Antique Jewellery? 
 I'm saying there might be a Dolly Rudolph, but I have never met her, and I've never bought any jewellery from her. 
 Huh. MAIA: Did you try calling the store? 
 I just don't understand how this article could get so much wrong. 
 What she's saying is the article's a part of this trend in fake news. 
 It makes up stories to encourage click bait. 
 Yes, but this isn't the only article. 
 Here. 
 These are 12 different websites, a lot of them well-respected, all saying that you did the exact same thing. 
 So how do you account for that? 
 I think the fake news was picked up by other websites as if it were real. 
 And why would they do that? Because the story is fun. 
 It has a clear villain... me. Oh, I don't know, Ms Rindell. 
 I don't think there's anything fun about this story. 
 Did you try calling the store? 
 What about this article about you visiting your father while he was awaiting trial? 
 What did you guys talk about? YESHA: That was a personal visit. 
 I was there as well as Mr Rindell's attorney, so... 
 No, no, not that visit. 
 I'm talking about the other two visits, when Maia went by herself. 
 That's more fake news. There were no other visits. 
 Yesha. 
 At this point, we'll interrupt the questioning so Maia and I can discuss. 
 Sure. 
 Why don't you figure out which is fake news... and which is not? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 What's wrong? What? 
 Uh, nothing. Why? You just have a look. 
 Mrs Kolstad wants to see you now. Are we in trouble? 
 What? No. Because I need this job. 
 Oh, I'll keep that in mind. 
 We've had to make a difficult decision here. 
 Uh-oh. What? 
 Well, that's what we tell associates when we release them. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Well, it's not quite that. 
 The capital contribution. Oh. 
 Yes, we know you're having trouble releasing it from your old firm. 
 But we need to insist. 
 No, I understand. 
 The partners voted. 
 If we don't get the contribution in a week, we'll need to make you of counsel. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 OK. 
 You may wanna think of getting a lawyer for the firm. 
 Mike Kresteva was just questioning Maia. 
 You went and saw your father again? 
 Yes. Why? 
 He asked me to download from my Uncle Jax's computer a list of clients called the Schtup List. 
 The Schtup List? What's that? 
 It's a list of VIP clients in the fund that Jax did special work for. 
 Um, backdating profits for tax purposes, transferring funds to other accounts... lllegal activities? Mm-hm. 
 And your father thought he could use this against your uncle? 
 Yes. 
 So you do know, by doing this, by helping your father, you've implicated yourself in wrongdoing? 
 He's my father. What could I do? 
 You can keep yourself out of jail. 
 Who is it? My lawyer? 
 Mr Rindell? Hello. I'm Mike Kresteva. 
 OK. Do I know you? 
 No, but I think I can help you. 
 Hi, Your Honour. Hi. 
 Hello. 
 I'm Amber. Tom. Nice to meet you. 
 Can I just say this is a very simple matter, Your Honour. 
 It's stealing. 
 It doesn't matter if it's a stolen purse or a stolen episode of TV, it should be treated the same way. 
 And yet here we are in civil court, Your Honour, not criminal court. 
 That's a funny approach, complaining that we're not going hard enough on your client. 
 I'm simply pointing out that Ms Lutz... 
 Wood. Wood-Lutz. 
 ...Ms Wood-Lutz has elected not to press criminal charges here, something she would do if this were a simple matter of theft. 
 It's also true that stolen purses don't usually cost $12 million. 
 Your Honour, the only reason we are here is because Ms Wood-Lutz's client has an issue in front of the FCC and they're afraid that the Trump administration... 
 My gosh. No. ...will decide against them. 
 I submit, Your Honour, my client is a scapegoat. 
 No, Your Honour. Can I speak, please? 
 Her client needs to prove themselves tough to this administration so they'll decide in their favour on the O&Os, Your Honour. 
 I don't even know what that means. Well, actually, I don't either. 
 Owned and operated TV stations. Right, so I don't understand. 
 Are you saying that your client didn't post the episode online? 
 No, he did. 1 don't understand, Your Honour. 
 What's the defence? Fair use. 
 JUDGE: Hmm. 
 OK. I'm game. Let's hear it. 
 Hi, Danny. 
 No, no, everything's fine. 
 It's just that thing we talked about with my apartment. 
 I think I wanna look for something not as grand. 
 Diane? Someone is here to see you and he has a present. 
 Uh... Danny, can I call you back? 
 OK, good. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Do you want me to stay and take notes? 
 No, thank you. 
 She's... chatty. 
 She is that. So how are you? 
 Good. You? Good. 
 You called? 
 Oh. 
 Uh, no. When? Last night. 
 I picked up, but you hung up. 
 No. No, that must've been an accidental dial. 
 I think my phone is... 
 Anyway, I'm sorry. 
 I was gonna call you anyway. Um... I have a favour. 
 I've agreed to give a speech on ballistics to the police union. 
 Really? Well, that doesn't sound like you. 
 Yes, it isn't. [LAUGHS] 
 I was hoping that you could read it. 
 Sure. Is tonight OK? 
 Yes. I have to give it tomorrow. 
 Hmm. And... thank you. 
 Oh. 
 So you didn't believe the network would broadcast the episode? 
 Sorry. Can I object here? Calls for speculation. 
 No. Overruled. Thank you, Your Honour. Mr Fisk? 
 They kept changing the broadcast date, pushing it back over and over again. 
 They never expected Trump would actually win. 
 When he did, they wanted to bury the episode. 
 That's why you put the episode online. Yes. 
 There's been a chilling effect at the studio and the network. 
 They're worried about the Donald holding grudges. 
 Who knew network execs sh1t their pants over 3am drunk tweets? 
 Objection, Your Honour. Can we not swear? 
 Yes, we cannot. Mr Fisk. I'm sorry. 
 I found the idea that they would censor themselves for Trump terrifying and I wanted to point that out. 
 So you put the episode online as a public service. 
 Hey, look, let's not go overboard here. He's not Nelson Mandela. 
 But I get your point. Counsellor, do you have anything? 
 Yes. Uh, let's see. 
 The definition of fair use is that 
 "brief excerpts of copyrightable material may be used”. 
 Brief. So, how long was that episode that you wrote? 
 42 minutes. 
 And how long was the excerpt you put online? 
 Because of the way I structured the episode, I needed to show the whole thing. 
 It was a matter of... OK, I know you wanna talk more. 
 But just answer the question. 
 I put the whole thing online. It was the only way to prove my point. 
 Why couldn't you prove your point by using a small part, a brief part? 
 Because it required the whole thing. All right. Nothing more, Your Honour. 
 Redirect, Your Honour. 
 How much did you make by uploading the episode? 
 How much did I make? Nothing. 
 Because this was a political move, not an economic one? 
 Exactly. All right. Anything else, counsellor? 
 Yes. I have a quick rebuttal witness. But it'll be really brief. 
 I'm Vaughn Yenko. I am a co-executive producer on the show. 
 OK, so that means you're like a writer? 
 No. 
 But... yeah, mostly. 
 Mr Fisk insists that he put his episode online as a political statement. 
 Is that true? Objection, Your Honour. Hearsay. 
 I think this is a hearsay exception, Your Honour. 
 Prior inconsistent statements. Yep. Overruled. 
 So I should answer, Your Honour? Oh, please. 
 It's not true, him putting the episode online for political reasons. 
 Fisk thought this episode was his best work. 
 And he thought it was going to win him an Emmy. 
 That's bullshit. Oh, you think you're God's gift. 
 This is about you being jealous. You stupid f*cking Yale asshole. 
 Yale is better than Princeton. Say that to Michelle Obama. 
 Stop it. Yale can wipe my ass. 
 JUDGE: Gentlemen, stop. Can wipe it. 
 Stop! Now, look, I hate Yale as much as the next guy, but no one is helping their case by arguing here. 
 OK, I get it. Sorry. 
 Now, you're arguing that he posted online for career, not political reasons. 
 I am not arguing, Your Honour. That's what the evidence proves. 
 Well, the evidence proves a lot of things. 
 All right, here's my decision. 
 Fair use is a joke here, counsellors. I mean, he put the whole thing online. 
 Now, I think the two of you should get together and decide damages. 
 Because, counsellors, you lost. It's a loser case. 
 Thank you, Your Honour. 
 You could only make me change my mind, counsellor. Bye. 
 So I guess that's it, huh? They're gonna bankrupt me. 
 No. That is far from it. 
 We're just getting started. 
 Hire me. I'll defend your firm with my last breath. 
 Mr Kresteva wants to tie together several accusations against our firm, not just our work on police brutality cases but also our connection to the Rindell Fund. 
 So we need a lawyer for the whole firm. 
 That's me. OK. So how do we defend ourselves? 
 Oh, we fight. It's a new civil rights. 
 And I will march with you, my bros, till my dying breath. 
 It's like Immortal Technique rapped... 
 "Yo, load the f*ck up, locked and loading." 
 "Remember to break that window when the cop comes in." 
 "Blow that m*therf*cker's head off." 
 So, that's what we need to do, blow their mofo heads off, OK? 
 Hmm. 
 Uh, excuse me. Yeah. 
 Tell me you have someone else in mind. What? 
 Do you have another lawyer in mind? 
 Yes. Who? 
 Someone unorthodox. 
 How unorthodox? Do you have a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 MAN: Diane Lockhart. 
 Excuse me. Mr Gross, how are you? 
 Oh, you know, harried, angry, worried. Yeah, that just about sums it up. 
 These are my lawyers. They wanna spend my $18 billion. 
 Hello, gentlemen. I heard you switched firms. 
 Yes, I was thinking about changing... An all-black firm, right? 
 Reddick, Kolstad... Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad. 
 Right, right. So you're not a name partner any more. 
 No, there's so much pressure to keep proving... 
 God, I hate Chicago, but here I am every week trying to bring the hog butcher into the 21st century. 
 Well, it's good to see you, Mr Gross. 
 I'm not very happy with my firm. 
 Looking for a fighter. When can I come see your office? 
 Whenever you want. 
 So this lawyer's a part-time dentist? 
 No, just someone who finds good deals on offices. 
 Is this "someone" up to facing Kresteva? 
 That's the hope. WOMAN: You can go in now, Ms Quinn. 
 This is feeling like The Wizard of Oz, Lucca. 
 Hello? WOMAN: Hello! 
 [GASPS] 
 Lucca Quinn! 
 How are you? I'm very well, thanks, Elsbeth. 
 How are you? Good. 
 Now that I'm out of the hospital. Oh. Were you sick? 
 No. Maybe. There was some disagreement about that. 
 Oh! 
 God, you're tall. Who are you? 
 Adrian... Boseman. Oh. 
 He's the head of our firm. Oh. How do you do? 
 I'm well, thank you. Excuse me. 
 What do you two need? 
 Uh, our firm needs a lawyer. 
 And Alicia once gave me a piece of advice. 
 When in trouble, hire Elsbeth. 
 Alicia Florrick? I like Alicia. How is she? 
 Searching... Alicia Keys. 
 Uh, Ada, no. Cancel. 
 [ ALICIAKEYS: "GIRL CAN'T BE HERSELF"] 
 I'm sorry. Um, Fantasia's out sick, so I have this thing. 
 Uh, Ada, cancel! Ada! I think it's still trying to recognise my voice. 
 Volume down. So... what's the problem? 
 Mike Kresteva. Do you know him? 
 No, but that doesn't mean anything. 
 He's heading up a task force. 
 They seem to be targeting our firm. Why? 
 We take on a lot of police brutality cases, and there are certain folk who think we win too many. 
 Kresteva has subpoenaed most of our firm. 
 There's nothing there, but... he's determined to find something. 
 Well, the fact that you know what you already know, well, it means there's something more you don't know, so... how do we find out what you don't know? 
 Are you asking us? 
 No. That's my problem. Just me. Let me see what I can do. 
 Give me, uh... a day. 
 OK. 
 Dad. 
 It's only bail. 
 I know. 
 God, I thought I'd never see this house again. 
 You OK? You look thinner. 
 I'm good. 
 The food lacked, you know. 
 What happened? I mean, why did they change their mind about bail? 
 I don't know. I'm hoping because their case is falling apart. 
 They didn't say? 
 Is that Maia? Yes, I called her. 
 Maia. Oh... 
 Look at this family. Back together again. 
 Like nothing happened. You're being sarcastic? 
 No, it really feels that way. 
 We called for pizza. Can you stay? No, um, I... 
 I'd better get back to Amy. Maybe tomorrow. 
 Your dad's talking to the FBI tomorrow. 
 About what? Oh, you know, this and that. 
 They're on a fishing expedition. We've done nothing wrong. 
 And they know it. [PHONE RINGS] 
 That's more friends. 
 Fair-weather friends, but it's good to be in fair weather. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Did Mom say anything to you about Uncle Jax? 
 No, just that Jax is sticking to his lies. 
 LENORE: Oh, hi, Gracie, yes... 
 Dad, I came over here one night and Jax was here... with Mom. 
 I know. She said. She did? 
 Yes, she was trying to convince Jax to change his story, to tell the truth. 
 Dad, no, it was more than that. It was just the two of them. 
 Oh, don't worry, honey. Mom told me. It didn't work. 
 I love you, sweetheart. It's the Michaels. 
 John wants to talk to you. 
 We'll talk. You look good, Maia. Johnny boy, how are you? 
 Isn't it wonderful, having your dad home? 
 Mmm, yeah. I wonder what Jax thinks? 
 I don't know. I haven't seen him. 
 Come to dinner tomorrow night and bring Amy. 
 Oh, unfurrow that brow. It'll give you creases. 
 Oh. 
 Mm. 
 Not happening. 
 Oh. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It's not as bad as it looks. KURT: Really? 
 It's just technical. 
 You testify in court all the time and you make it understandable. 
 That's an interrogatory with a jury of 12. 
 This is me in front of 500 people. 
 500? Whoa. 
 OK. 
 Well, the subject is... 3-D technology in ballistics. 
 No. No, the impact of interferometers on 3-D renderings. 
 The subject is 3-D technology in ballistics. 
 And as far as I can tell, this is about the use of lasers to magnify imperfections on a bullet casing, right? 
 Yeah, using an interferometer to create what is... 
 Right. 
 And you can magnify a bullet casing up to two microns? 
 Yes. OK, and how small is that? 
 Just give me a real-world example. 
 I mean, just talk to me. Come on, take a sip. 
 Tell me how small two microns are. 
 Two microns are about one fiftieth of the width of a human hair. 
 Good. You just said something I understand, so start there. 
 I mean, just take a single human hair and imagine you had a knife that could cut that hair into 50 thin slices. 
 What else? 
 Did you drive here? No, a cab. 
 Good. 
 Drink up. 
 This is our cost for the episode in question, and this is our best and final offer, but I can cut to the chase. 
 We're willing to cut our ask to $6 million, but we want a public apology. 
 Take your time with it. 
 This is our... This is our counter. 
 Just so you know, we already cut our ask in half. 
 We're not ready to entertain... 
 Take your time with it. 
 f*ck you. 
 Here come the shitstorm. 
 Your Honour, sorry, but we have cut our ask in half, and they have bullied me... 
 If this is supposed to be a joke, counsellor, I'm not laughing. 
 Your Honour, they're asking us to pay damages ona TV show they never intended to broadcast. 
 No, Your Honour, I'm sorry, but that's untrue. It's a valued show. 
 Look, they won round one, Your Honour. 
 Our client dropped the episode on the internet. 
 This is round two. What are the damages? 
 And we would argue there are no damages. 
 When Donald Trump was elected president, the network decided to dump the episode. 
 And they can't claim damages on something that is worthless. 
 Your Honour, I am stunned. I don't even know how to respond. 
 I don't either. So let's hear from the witnesses. 
 Thank you, Your Honour. Yeah. 
 Yeah, but he's giving us the names. He's cooperating. 
 And we never agreed to anything other than his bail. 
 I'll... Let's deal with this later, OK? OK. Bye. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. Do I know you? 
 No, I don't think so, which is weird, because we've been moving in the same circles for years. 
 OK. Who are you? 
 Oh. Um... 
 Elsbeth Tascioni. 
 Oh, sure. 
 I don't like eating alone, do you? I do, actually. 
 Reminds me of school. That soup looks good. What is it? 
 I don't know. Check, please. 
 Yeah, they're a little slow here, but that just gives us longer to get acquainted. 
 Check, please! 
 I represent Reddick, Boseman & Kolstad. 
 Ah-ha. So they hired someone. Well, good for them. 
 Uh, look, here's the thing. Um, this is my lunch break, Ms Tanjoni. 
 Oh, Tascioni. Yeah, whatever. 
 So, you're making a deal with Henry Rindell. 
 You heard my phone call? 
 Yes. But I also saw that Mr Rindell was released on bail. 
 You must have some sway in the Department of Justice. 
 I do, and I've never heard of you. 
 That's because I'm just little old me. 
 "Little old me" who follows people and listens to their phone calls. 
 Oh, your check came. Let me treat. No, no. I got it. 
 Here's the thing, uh... Oh, Elsbeth. 
 Elsbeth. I do have some sway at the DOJ. 
 And I think you'll find I'm a pretty tough foe. 
 You go after me professionally, I'll go after you personally. 
 And I tend to win. 
 Yikes. That sounds scary. 
 No. Just telling the truth. 
 Don't follow me. Don't listen to my phone calls. 
 The defence calls Mr Maurice Weintraub to the stand. 
 Objection. Your Honour, I'm sorry. 
 But Mr Weintraub isn't on the defence witness list. 
 We're calling him as a rebuttal witness, Your Honour. 
 Mr Weintraub was on the plaintiff's list. 
 Well, then, he's on a list somewhere. Let's get him here. 
 Mr Weintraub, when did your network plan to air Mr Fisk's episode? 
 Quick correction. It's not his episode. 
 The episode he wrote. 
 No. For the purpose of copyright, we wrote the episode. 
 The studio and the network, we paid Mr Fisk for a work for hire. 
 OK. Then let's discuss the episode you wrote. 
 It must've been hard facing that blank page, sir. 
 What did Hemingway call it? Objection, Your Honour. 
 I guess I'd call it sarcastic badgering. 
 Sustained. Unsarcastically. LUCCA: OK, then, let's try this. 
 When did you decide to air this episode? 
 Sometime in May, but now it's been online, there's no value in doing so. 
 And how many episodes of this show does your network air every year? 
 22. 
 Didn't you order 23 episodes this year, sir? 
 Yes, that's true. 
 And didn't you order 23 episodes not at the beginning of the year, as you usually do, but after you decided you couldn't air Mr Fisk's episode? 
 Yes, that's right, when we realised Mr Fisk had put the episode online, we knew we needed an additional episode. 
 Yeah, but this happened before he put the episode online. 
 Objection. Counsellor is testifying. 
 JUDGE: Sustained. 
 OK, well, here is a memo to the show's writing staff asking for an additional episode. 
 Could you read the date there? 
 November 18, 2016. 
 Wasn't that before my client put the episode online? 
 AMBER: Objection. Beyond the scope. JUDGE: Sustained. 
 Isn't it true, sir, that after Trump won the presidency, you were worried the episode would offend him? 
 So you decided not to show it. [PHONE BUZZES] 
 That's why you needed a 23rd episode. 
 No, sometimes we just... 
 It's a popular show. Sometimes we order more episodes. 
 OK. Nothing further. 
 Mr Boseman, a word. 
 I hear your firm is looking to branch out into other areas of expertise. 
 We're always looking for opportunities. 
 If you don't mind some unsolicited advice... 
 Is it free? 
 You'll find that entertainment law is an extremely small pond. 
 This little performance you're putting on will only help you up to a point. 
 When you embarrass men like Mr Weintraub, you've passed that point. 
 You are a real kick. Yep. 
 And I'll kick your ass if you're not careful. 
 Oh. I can't wait. 
 You're not bad. 
 No, I'm good. 
 Well, a little sarcastic maybe. Judges don't like that. 
 This is so helpful, being graded. Thank you. 
 I think we have a sarcasm problem here. Is there some reason why you're here? 
 Yes. I spoke to the assistant attorney general on your firm's behalf. 
 I don't think you'll be having any problems any more. 
 Hmm. 
 The usual response is thank you. 
 Yes, thank you. 
 
 
 
 He's now coming after our firm for our connection to the Rindell Fund. 
 We've had to hire a firm-wide lawyer. 
 What? Yeah. Thank you. 
 OK. OK, now I'm pissed. 
 Yeah, you look it. Thanks. 
 FISK: It was fantastic. You were fantastic. 
 Did you see his face when you made him read the date? 
 You made him read it. It was classic. 
 It was like Perry Mason. Yep. 
 I think we've taken this as far as we can, so we should think about a possible deal. 
 What? 
 I'm sorry, I... We have them on the run now, right? 
 We don't have a smoking gun. 
 Without that, we have to assume we're gonna lose the case on the merits. 
 What we're left with, Keith, is trying to get the network to agree to a dollar amount you can live with. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 Oh, wow. So we should talk about your assets. 
 It'll ruin me. You don't think they'll take my Prius, do you? 
 No. Oh, hi there, Diane. 
 Mr Gross. Look at this place. 
 A real African-American law firm. I love it. 
 Everywhere you look. Except here. White, white, white. 
 Marissa. Yep, I'm leaving. 
 No, no, no. Wait, stay. Take some notes or something. 
 Sure. I'll just sit right here. 
 So, Diane, I am thinking of adding your firm to my Midwest business. 
 What do you say about that? I say that's a great idea. 
 Good. Yeah, we could use a little fight in our legal department. 
 You'll get that here. Fighting is in our blood. 
 I know. You know how I know that? No, actually, no. 
 This case you're bringing against the networks for sucking up to Trump. 
 Isn't that great? No other firm would take it. 
 GROSS: Exactly. Everybody's so afraid of that guy. 
 But I say we do to Trump the same thing the Republicans did to Obama. 
 Don't settle, don't negotiate and don't back down. 
 MARISSA: Wait till you see the way they go after the network in court. 
 GROSS: See that? This is why I'm here, Diane. 
 I just have a bunch of old-fart white guys who don't know how to fight. 
 That's why I'm thinking about coming here. You guys know how to fight. 
 So let's fight. Indeed. 
 Um, could you just give me one minute, Mr Gross? 
 Here's my worry, Ms Tascioni. Maia and I have attorney-client privilege... 
 Yes, and so do we, because I represent the firm. 
 Yes, but some of these issues are only Maia's. 
 Hmm. 
 Then she should quit the firm because her issues are hurting the firm's interests. 
 YESHA: I don't think that's... What do you wanna know? 
 Why is your dad out on bail? 
 I don't know. 
 What names might he have given to Mr Kresteva? 
 Maia, I don't think you should answer that. 
 My dad had me download and give to him a list of all the VIP clients that the fund did illegal work for. 
 And you think he gave them those names? 
 Yes. 
 Did you look at the list? Yes. 
 Were there any names connected to this firm? 
 No. No, I looked them all up. 
 There are no clients, no lawyers from this firm. 
 Are you sure? Because he found someone... 
 I like that lipstick. That's a good colour. 
 Thank you. What is it? 
 Dior. Rouge. 
 I mean, it could be Chanel. No. 
 There is a Reddick Boseman lawyer connected to that VIP list. 
 Who? You. 
 You implicated yourself by downloading that list and getting it to your father. 
 But that would require your father turning on you, and he wouldn't turn on you, would he? 
 OK, let's leave this here. 
 And I will try to find out something more. 
 Oh, and if your dad asks anything more of you, Maia, I urge you to say no. 
 He might be doing something at Mr Kresteva's bidding in order to lighten his sentence. 
 He might also be recording your conversations. 
 I hate to talk that way, but... you pay me to be suspicious. 
 OK. I'm going. Bye. 
 [MOUTHING] 
 How do you feel? 
 You didn't have to come. I know I didn't have to come. 
 Thank you. It's the last time I'm doing this. 
 MAN: Ballistics expert, Kurt McVeigh. Just picture them all naked. 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 [EXHALES] 
 You'll like me even if I f*ck up? [ will. Break a leg. 
 Good evening. 
 Take a hair from your head. 
 Now imagine that you can split that hair down the middle not once, not twice but 50 times. 
 That is the equivalent of two microns. 
 To be effective at ballistics, that is the measure that we need to be discussing. 
 Thanks for coming. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Great. I mean, you didn't rush. 
 You made all your points comprehensible. I mean... 
 Rindell's still reluctant to give up her name. 
 No, just a more aggressive posture, that's all. 
 Yeah. OK. 
 I'm home. Bye. 
 Say, D. What's happening? Where are you? 
 WOMAN: Back here. 
 Oh... the ice cream. I totally forgot. I'm happy to go back out. 
 No, no, no, we got some. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Sounds like you've been drinking already. 
 Mike, you're late. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. Uh, yeah. 
 I just... wasn't expecting to see... 
 Your friend from work. How come you've never introduced us? 
 I said the same thing. Mike is so private at work. 
 I was shopping at Trader Joe's when Elsbeth heard my last name and we started talking. 
 About you skinny-dipping in Hawaii. 
 She got that out of me. We were so sunburned. Oh, my God. 
 And she invited herself over? 
 No, I invited her. I didn't wanna drink alone. 
 Then Elsbeth offered to help me address all of the thank-you notes for our anniversary. 
 It was my pleasure. I just love this kitchen, by the way. 
 You are so sweet. And the study. 
 Oh, yes, I love your study. The way you make the whole thing work together. 
 You were... I'm terrible with colours. 
 ...in my study? 
 Yeah, on my way to the bathroom. 
 I see. Mike, come on. Give me a kiss. 
 Elsbeth was just saying how fun you are at the office. 
 He is. [CHUCKLES] 
 I'll be right back. 
 In college, Mike was a cheerleader. Oh. 
 And I was the shy girl. 
 You weren't shy. was. 
 No. The way you are now? 
 That's because I'm drinking. Oh. 
 But Mike really pulled me out of my shell, didn't you? 
 Yeah. Thanks for dropping by. 
 Oh, yes. I guess I should go. 
 No, no, stay for dinner. Oh, no, no, no. 
 Maybe, uh... Maybe some other time. 
 Yes. And we have that lunch date. Oh, yeah? 
 When's that? Next week, right? 
 Right. I'm treating. No, I'm treating. 
 I'll walk you out. Oh, don't bother, Mike. 
 Oh, it's no bother. 
 I could have you disbarred for doing something like that. 
 You come to my home... I was invited into your home. 
 Go through my desk, shake down my wife for information. 
 I would never shake down Diedre. She's too lovely. 
 Yeah, well, let's see what a disbarment committee says. 
 Get home safe! 
 Yeah, let's see what they say. What was your quote? Um... 
 "When you go after me professionally, I go after you personally.” I never said that. Yes, you did. At the diner. 
 That's a lie. 
 KRESTEVA: You go after me professionally, I'll go after you personally. 
 It's an illegal recording. 
 Yes, unless it's used to contradict a lie. 
 Is everything all right? Oh, yeah, just something at work! 
 ELSBETH: Bye! 
 90% of the media in this country is controlled by six corporations, Your Honour. 
 Think about that. Think. 
 A column of tanks in Tiananmen Square, for instance, is one way of controlling what people see, hear, but it is not the only way, Your Honour. 
 I thought we were negotiating. Adrian thinks we can do better. 
 A government intent on stifling the free flow of ideas need only stifle these six corporations. 
 Your Honour, we are living in Tiananmen Square right here. 
 And this young man, by putting an episode of television on a website, stood in front of those tanks. 
 And I am asking this court today to stop those tanks from crushing this young man's spirit and his defiance. 
 OK. Good speech. 
 Now can I make my decision? Oh, God, please. 
 Your Honour, we have new evidence just come to our attention. 
 Your Honour, you were just about to decide. 
 We believe this evidence touches upon your First Amendment concerns. 
 What is it? 
 The president just tweeted this morning, Your Honour. 
 "Congrats to Weintraub for standing up to another Hollywood crybaby.” 
 "Time to look into who they hire to write." 
 That tweet is prima facie government action that triggers a First Amendment defence. 
 You said this morning, Your Honour, this is not a First Amendment case, but I submit, in all due respect, now it is. 
 [SIGHS] 
 A public apology and we'll call it even. 
 No. What, you want us to pay you? 
 No public apology and we'll call it even. 
 I'll talk to my clients. 
 I hope that was worth it to you, because it won't do much for your business. 
 Is it worth it to us? 
 We'll see. 
 You don't like talking about yourself much, do you? 
 I'm just walking. 
 No, we've talked everything about me. 
 My overbearing family, my sister's parachuting record, my struggle with addiction. 
 Yeah, Diet Coke doesn't really count. 
 But nothing about you. 
 There is nothing about me. 
 Are your parents happy that you're a lawyer? 
 I guess. Oh, my God. 
 It's like a cross-examination. 
 Are they both still alive? Yes. 
 Who's your best friend? I don't have a friend. 
 Stop. Look at me. 
 Say it again. I don't have a friend. 
 I don't believe you. That's your right. 
 What? Please don't say you're gonna save me. 
 No. I'm gonna kiss you. 
 OK. 
 Then I'm gonna save you. 
 Shh. 
 [CAR ALARM BLARES] 
 [+ MINNUTES: "MORE TO LUV] 
 I had a best friend. 
 Who? A co-worker. 
 He or she? She. 
 Had? She's not a friend any more? 
 I think she is. 
 I don't make friends easily. 
 Why not? 
 I don't like to get hurt. 
 You afraid I'm gonna hurt you? 
 No, I don't get hurt by boys. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Are you offended? 
 I don't know. I don't even understand it. ow! 
 You're gonna make me act crazy. 
 -lam? Oh, yeah. You f*cked up. 
 You got me interested. 
 Hey. 
 Good morning. 
 What's with the boxes? 
 I'm looking for a new place. 
 Why? 
 Just for a change. 
 Change to what? 
 A new place. 
 Do you wanna move in together? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 It's my problem. 
 I have to get to work. 
 Diane... let me help. 
 Kurt, last night was great, but... I have to get to work. 
 JULIUS: Makes you do the dirty work. What is that? 
 Come in. Diane. Good news? 
 I think so. 
 Neil Gross saw that we won the case. He wants to come on board. 
 Yes! 58 million a year! 
 And that's in a slow year. Wait, wait. 
 I think I'm seeing a caveat here. -Asmall one. 
 What? 
 I like this firm a lot. I think it's got a great future. 
 But in good conscience, I can't encourage Neil Gross to come here if I'm only of counsel. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me, Diane? Why is Diane gonna be of counsel? 
 She isn't going to be of counsel if we get her capital contribution. 
 Diane, we can figure this out later. No, we should figure this out now. 
 What do you want? 
 I want my capital contribution to come directly from the Chumhum retainer. 
 And I wanna be made a name partner. 
 We'll have to run that by the partnership committee. 
 Seriously? 
 We will run it by the partnership committee. 
 But the answer is yes. 
 Congratulations, Diane Lockhart, full partner. 
 Thank you. 
 It's good to be wanted. 
 She's gonna be trouble.
