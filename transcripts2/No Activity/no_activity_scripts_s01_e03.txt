 Hendy : Car 72, no activity. 
 Can't believe you didn't get me anything. 
 I offered you these. 
 Hendy : I told you I don't eat that sh1t. 
 I don't eat that low-grade petrol station sh1t. 
 It's not sh1t. The guy, he told me his brother brings them in. 
 They're, like, pork and fennel or something. 
 He's a farmer. He brings them in every day, they're fresh. 
 They're really good. 
 All right, gimme one. 
 Mmm. 
 That's f*cking horrible! 
 [LAUGHS] Gotcha! 
 They're sh1t. [LAUGHS] 
 You're a dickhead. 
 Yeah. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Mate, lips and arseholes are gourmet compared to that sh1t. 
 Oh, f*ck off. 
 Imagine the worst parts of the animal just mixed in together. 
 That's inside you now. 
 [GAGS] 
 [MOCK-GAGS] Yeah. 
 [HENDY HEAVES] 
 [STOKES LAUGHS] 
 You're... [HEAVES]

 Dispatch : Operation Big Red, continuing surveillance at the docks. 
 We've got two known associates holed up at the shipping container. 
 Car 72, continuing surveillance. 
 [BUZZING] 
 Eh? Do you like it? 
 Just stop it, mate. 
 The middle woman. 
 f*ckin' stop it! 
 I won't stop it! It's good! 
 Yeah! Up and down... and up. 
 [BUZZING STOPS] 
 How good are drones?! 
 Basically, you can do anything with them. 
 It's the future, mate. The future is a drone. 
 You're taking out civilians. Pew-pew-pew-pew! 
 It's like computer games. 
 Just sit on your couch and bloody take over a bloody nation of innocents. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Yeah? You don't like a drone? 
 What does a drone actually do besides being a miniature helicopter? 
 Exactly, that's it! Imagine having a bloody miniature... 
 That's the point! 
 It's a miniature helicopter at your disposal to do whatever you want with, you idiot! 
 So what? 
 Who wouldn't want one?! 
 You wouldn't want that? 
 What can they do? 
 They can spy. 
 You know you've got, like, a bloody hot neighbour? 
 Just over the fence, have a look. 
 Hello, having a sunbake. Uh-oh. 
 You get it back on your phone. 
 A little message. Beep-beep! 
 And you check out her beep-beeps. 
 You don't see the future, do you? You don't see. 
 This is like a bloody crystal ball in front of me. 
 I don't understand how you can't realise the potential of this. 
 Shut up! 
 I will not shut up! 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 Fine, then. 
 You're not in on the deal. I was gonna let you in early, but... 
 [BUZZES] 
 It's the future, fuckface! 
 Get the... Hey! 
 April : Car 72, please report. 
 Car 72, please report. 
 Hendy : Car 72. No activity, April. 
 April : Great, thanks. 
 You okay then? 
 Yep. Yep, fine. 
 Oh, that's good. 
 Uh, yep. 
 Sounded a bit awkward. 
 Yeah, is a bit. 
 How was the date? 
 I thought you said the date went well. 
 The date went awesomely. But she's blocking me. 
 I'm texting, I'm texting, I'm calling. 
 Nothing on the radio. Like, she's an ice queen on the radio. 
 I don't know what happened. 
 It was, like, in the top two best dates of my life. 
 Maybe number one. It was maybe number one. 
 He's constantly calling. 
 I would have thought he'd be too embarrassed. 
 Like, why would he wanna relive any of it? 
 Like, let's pretend it didn't happen. 
 So I take her to an old-school classy restaurant. 
 I take her to Werriston's. 
 Ahh. Lovely. 
 Yeah. You know, not flashy. Not 'fusion'. 
 I'm a full gentleman. I take her chair out, you know. 
 I do the full thing, you know, "You look lovely tonight." 
 With the little bow like that? 
 With the little bow. 
 It was like being on a date with my dad. 
 But, like, not even my dad. Like, mygrandad. 
 Do you know him very well? 
 Not really. 
 He was really... 
 I guess it's gentlemanly, but it was a bit weird. 
 Like, it was, like... 
 "These are the things you do on a date." 
 This couple a couple of tables away have a proposal. 
 Oh! 
 Lovely. 
 That doesn't happen every day! 
 Not every day. 
 And the whole restaurant's like, "Aww. Lovely." 
 I just got really drunk to get through it. 
 And then the couple next to us gets engaged. Whoop-de-do! 
 So I go, "Oh, look at those young lovers." 
 And I think of a really painful memory to bring up emotion. 
 I was thinking about when I was 13, I was down at the yabby hole and caught the... 
 Yeah, no, the fish hook in the nuts. 
 Yeah. And I get tears in my eyes, I always do when I think of it too much, and, like, a little spillover, a little tear down the cheek. 
 Open the floodgates! 
 She doesn't know what I'm thinking. 
 But it looks like I'm thinking about them. 
 And he starts crying. 
 What?! 
 It didn't seem... genuine, either. 
 It was kind of big, ugly crying. 
 And then to top that, I go, "Garçon, a bottle of your finest fizz for the happy couple." 
 Generous. I can give. 
 Yes. 
 And then at the end, he doesn't offer to pay, and so we go Dutchies. 
 And I've paid for half of a bottle of champagne for people I don't even care about. 
 We live in totally different directions, but I insist. 
 "Let's get a cab together." 
 Oh, how gallant. 
 Yeah. Get back to her place. 
 I'm tanked. 
 Mmm. 
 He said, "I'll walk you in." 
 I went, "That'd be nice, but do go off home." 
 "I'm pretty tired." 
 I'm walking up. Turn around, he's paid, cab's gone. 
 So we get into my place and I'm, like, suddenly... 
 Something hits me. I gotta bolt to the bathroom. 
 And I am violently ill, like, both... 
 Like, violently ill for about 15 minutes. 
 And I swear he could hear it. 
 She's in there for, like, 15 minutes. 
 Hoo! 
 Must be doing all the bits and pieces, you know? 
 And I think, "Well, she's making an effort." 
 "I should make an effort too." 
 So I take off my shoes, take off my jacket, you know, just loosen my belt a little bit, sit on the bed. 
 So she comes out, right. Joins me on the king-size single. 
 And we start making out. And it's super passionate. 
 We're like... teenage kids. 
 It's really... you know, just passionate and full of energy. 
 It was like a German shepherd. 
 His, like, tongue is on my eye, in my ear. 
 Ohh! 
 Just all over. 
 I mean, I haven't brushed my teeth, Carol. 
 And I think, "Let's take this up a notch." 
 And I brought out the big guns. 
 You know I used to play the clarinet. 
 Yeah. 
 For years. 
 And still do occasionally. 
 I've heard you, yeah. The Christmas parties. 
 Yeah, yeah, so you know I'm pretty good with the puh-puh-puh... 
 With the tonguing and the... Right? So I go downtown. 
 'Cause I'm, like, "Let's show this lady a good time." 
 I don't know, he's, um, talking some sh1t about used to play the tuba, and so it's his thing. 
 I, um, think I nodded off for a bit. 
 And then I, um, just pretended to enjoy it and went to sleep. 
 Finished with a climax. 
 She's kinda sleepy, relaxed, blissed out. 
 I'm, like, I don't ask for anything in return. 
 I'm all about giving. 
 Nice. 
 Leave her there, like, smooth over the bed. 
 I kiss her, just peck on the forehead. 
 "Goodnight, sweet lady." 
 Wow! 
 Yeah. 
 You just kicked that out of the park. 
 I think so. 
 I wish I could have half of that skill. 
 I'd say it was the worst date ever, actually. 
 Bottom, bottom. 
 If you could teach me a bit of that clarinet thing, I could take that home to Wendy and just... just win her. 
 Could we not talk about you impregnating your sad wife? 
 Do we have to? Can I just have this? 
 Can we just leave this with me for now? 
 [MOANS SOFTLY] 
 Man : No sign of suspicious persons at this time. 
 There's thousands of shipping containers down here. 
 We've just gotta wait 'em out. 
 Who's that? 
 Who is that? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Got a girlfriend? 
 No. 
 Who is she? 
 Shut up. 
 You got a picture? Show us a picture! 
 I don't need to show you a picture. 
 Got any nude pictures? 
 No, I've not got nude pictures. 
 Show us the nude pictures... 
 Hey! 
 She, uh... 
 She calls me 'Mr Positions'. 
 [SPLUTTERS] 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Why? 
 'Cause of all the manoeuvres I do. 
 Oh, yeah? Mr Kama Sutra, eh? 
 I can do all the bloody... I can do all the styles. 
 Oh, yeah. What's your favourite? 
 Freelance. 
 Oh, right. 
 Just, like, any... any position she wants me in, I can bend to it. 
 There's only one or two exceptions to that. 
 The ploughman's lunch? 
 I've never got into that one. 
 Never been a fan of a pickle. 
 Splitting the bamboo? 
 What? 
 Crying monkey? 
 Really? Is that a real one? 
 The whispering frog? 
 How does a frog whisper? 
 They don't even have lips. 
 Yeah, they do. 
 Of course they've got lips. 
 How do they whisper? 
 [BLOWS RASPBERRY SOFTLY] 
 That is some hot stuff. 
 You ever done the... the blind man? 
 What's that? You just turn out the lights? 
 Yes. 
 It's just in-the-dark style. 
 The crouching tiger. The beamer. The mini minor. 
 Oh, I don't even know these things. 
 I feel like an idiot. 
 It's just young love. 
 We did the lamb cuntlet. 
 The what? 
 The lamb cuntlet. 
 Don't you mean 'cutlet'? 
 Cutlet? 
 Cuntlet. What are you saying? 
 I said 'lamb cutlet'. 
 Isn't a cutlet, like, a pirate thing? 
 Like, "Arggh, here's me cutlet"? 
 No, a cutlet's a type of lamb chop. 
 They cut down a full rack of ribs and they create the little individual kind of meat lollipops. 
 I've been having cuntlets at my nan's house for years. 
 We say 'cuntlet'. 
 She a bit deaf? 
 It's all right. 
 You're nice, man. 
 Oh... 
 Everyone's always like, "Oh, you're the best, Glen." 
 You're not. You're kinda... You're honest with me, you know? 
 You'll call a cuntlet a cutlet and I like that. 
 It's all right, mate. 
 Stop it. 
 Nah, it's all right. 
 Stop it! 
 
 
 
 You guys there? Come in. 
 Yes. Jacob? 
 Hi, it's Jacob from Port... 
 Yes, Jacob from Port Security. 
 I know who it is. 
 I've come across a bag of white powder. 
 About 350g. 
 Where did you find it? 
 Out... Not in here. Outside the office. 
 You should probably come and check it out. 
 You might be able to shed a little light on it. 
 [MUTTERS GIBBERISH] 
 Oh, for f*ck's sake. 
 Yep, okay. Just wait there, Jacob. 
 I'll come down shortly. 
 [SQUEAKS] Fuckhead! 
 Ah! f*ckin' hell. Jesus Christ. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Because you're his father. 
 [CAROL SIGHS] 
 Thanks for nothing. 
 How'd you go? 
 No good. 
 No good. Nuh. 
 Refuses to take any responsibility for his own son. 
 That's a shame, Carol. 
 Refuses to help me out when I need him. 
 You know, Lachy's been suspended. 
 I can't have him being home by himself the whole time. 
 He's been suspended for a week. 
 For... a week? 
 Yeah. 
 So, there... 
 There was a bubbler. 
 And he's... mounted the bubbler. 
 Ah, right. Okay. 
 For his own pleasure. 
 Got that, yeah. 
 I mean, I just... They're making a very big thing of it. 
 They've bloody cordoned the whole area off. 
 They've taped it up, you know? 
 Oh, poor Lachy. 
 That's a bit much. 
 I know. Overreaction. 
 I've just walked straight over to the bubbler and I have drunk out of it just to show everyone, there's nothing wrong with the bubbler. 
 Treating it like he's damaged school property. [SCOFFS] 
 Anyway, I'm just... 
 You know, and everyone knows. All the kids know. 
 And they're... You know, kids can be cruel too. 
 They can be. Oh, poor Lachy. 
 I know. Calling him names and stuff. 
 Aquanuts. 
 Bubble Boy. 
 H2Orgasm. 
 Fountain Fucker. 
 [SNIGGERS] 
 Oh, that... That is really hurtful. 
 To Lachy. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm glad it's a source of amusement for you. 
 It's not funny. I'm sorry, Carol. 
 That's... 
 Juvenile. 
 Sorry, Carol. 
 Hendy : Jacob. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 You're better-looking than I thought. 
 Thank you. You had some white powder? 
 Yes, I did. 
 Okay. 
 Little bit of white powder. 
 Couple of eggs. 
 Cup of sugar. 
 And... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 It's a cake. 
 It's a cake that says "Welcome Hendy" and that said 'Stokes' but the air conditioning's broken so it's melted. 
 So you brought me down here because you made a cake. 
 No. 
 My mum made a cake. 
 I think I told you to tell nobody that we were here. 
 I didn't tell anyone that you were here. 
 Who made the cake? 
 My mum. 
 Your mum made the cake. 
 So you told your mum on the phone we were here at the docks on an undercover operation when I specifically told you not to tell anybody that we were here. 
 It's just my mum. 
 Bit annoyed. 
 It's not appropriate. The cake's not appropriate. 
 It's just a cake, mate. 
 Don't call again. 
 I'll take the cake because it's here. 
 Welcome. 
 Thank you. 
 It's a pleasure. 
 It's not appropriate, but thank you. 
 Wasn't so hard, though, was it? 
 Okay. 
 [SPEED DIAL BEEPS RAPIDLY] 
 Yep. Yeah, they loved it. 
 This is sh1t, isn't it? 
 It's all right. 
 You know where I wish I was? 
 Where? 
 The States. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 This country... this country's gone to sh1t. 
 Why? 
 It's just negative vibes everywhere you go. 
 I just don't feel supported here as a criminal. 
 Here, you're taught to dream small. 
 I wanna dream big. I wanna go over there and blow sh1t up. 
 You know when you just wanna bloody... pull out a bloody Phillips head and f*ckin' stab 'em in the f*ckin' head! 
 Yeah. 
 You do, don't ya? 
 Yeah. And... and you mention that around here and half the time people just wanna piss on your dreams. 
 But they freak out. "Ooh, no! Bloody don't do that!" 
 It's pretty true. It's pretty kinda small-scale, isn't it? 
 Just the whole vibe over there's just supportive. 
 It's just one of... 
 I know this is gonna sound weird, but it's... it's love. 
 They just support your ideas. 
 How do you mean? 
 Okay, so, like... 
 I pitched at a meeting. 
 A few months ago, I was gonna go bloody blow up a casino. 
 Over here, okay. 
 All those naysayers are, like, "No, you can't do that." 
 "Don't bloody blow up a casino." 
 Tall poppy syndrome. 
 Yeah, totally! 
 Over there, they're just, like, "Go for it!" 
 "You blow up that f*cking casino." 
 "You get in there, you blow that fucker sky-high." 
 Follow your dreams. 
 You don't have your dreams, what have you got? 
 Nothin'! 
 You know what I mean? 
 Yeah. 
 You're a little sweetheart, aren't ya? 
 I've never been there. 
 What? 
 Never been to the States. 
 Sorry, you've never been to the States? 
 No. 
 You've gotta go, mate. 
 Hey. Stop. 
 I'm gonna take you there right now. 
 What do you mean? 
 Close your bloody eyes. 
 Close 'em. 
 What? 
 Close your eyes. 
 Open your mouth. 
 What? 
 Just open your mouth. It's good. 
 I don't want to. 
 Come on. Come on, you'll like it. 
 Welcome to America. 
 That was just a taste. 
 Wow! 
 Man : Still no sign of shipments or suspects. 
 We sure we got the right dockyard? 
 [PHONE BEEPS] 
 Oops. 
 Ah! [CHUCKLES] Oh, no. 
 Hmm? 
 Can you, um... Oh, what's that? 
 Look out there for a second. 
 Why? 
 Just... just give me some privacy, will you? 
 Why? 
 Put the binoculars on and look out the window. 
 Why? 
 Because you're my friend and I'm asking you. 
 What's happening? 
 [UNZIPS FLY] 
 [CAMERA CLICKS] 
 Oh, Jesus, Stokes! 
 It's all right. 
 What is happening? 
 I'm just taking a photo. 
 All right? For Pam. 
 Are you having an affair? 
 No! 
 No way. 
 I just met this... this lady at the airport. 
 We got our bags mixed up on the carriage. On the carousel thing. 
 We both went to grab the same bag and hit heads. 
 We had a laugh. 
 And then we went back out, we were at the taxi rank, and I was looking around and I shuffled and we hit heads a second time! 
 Mm-hm. 
 So we laughed again. 
 And anyway, she went to get in a taxi and she stopped, right? 
 She turns around and she had the courage to walk up to me and give me her card. 
 At which point, you said, "I'm sorry. I'm married." 
 Well, no. 
 No? 
 I just thought... how brave she was. 
 I mean, that... that showed real courage. 
 And I... You know, I just think that that should be rewarded. 
 So now you're sending her dick pics. 
 Well... yes. 
 It's what she asked for. 
 But, you know, there's nothing sexual in it. 
 Isn't it? I'm sorry, I thought dick pics were pretty sexual. 
 No! She's... Pam's 65. 
 65?! 
 All right, well, maybe for her there is something sexual, but for me, I'm just rewarding her bravery. 
 And you get to send your dick to people and not go to prison for it. 
 I just wanna live in a world where that kind of... bravery and beauty is rewarded. 
 We shut each other down too much, you know? 
 She took a chance, she put herself out there. 
 She was brave and I think that was beautiful. 
 [PHONE BEEPS] 
 Oh, here we go. 
 Ohh! 
 Oh, Jesus Chri... 
 Whoa! 
 How did she get the... 
 Oh, yeah, this has gotta stop. 
 Jimmy : You know, I've gotta say, you know, the boss's nephew, a bit of a cock, throws his weight around a bit, misplaced sense of humour, perhaps, bit of a silly billy, big mouth, you know, all talk, dresses like a fool, bald prick, always getting his foot out of his stupid... stupid mouth, dumb moustache, silly eyes. 
 When you kinda peel all that back, you're actually... actually a pretty special bloke. 
 I liked you immediately. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 Yeah, I'm almost gonna miss you when... when Bruce gets back. 
 Are you joking? 
 Yeah, when Bruce recovers from the injuries. 
 He's not coming back, mate. 
 What do you mean? 
 Brucey's gone. He's bloody... 
 He's brain dead. 
 No, I heard he was shot in the leg. 
 No, no, no, mate. 
 And once he gets off the crutches... 
 No, no, mate. He's gone! 
 He's a full vegetable. He's like a vegetable. 
 He's got the mind of a bloody wilted parsnip that's been sitting in the bottom of the fridge too long. 
 He's all bloody bendy. He can't... 
 Like, sentence don't come no good no more. 
 Course he can. 
 Nah, mate, he's gone. 
 His brain's gone to mush. He's like overboiled broccoli. 
 You know your nanna? Remember your nanna would make broccoli? 
 Just boil it for years. 
 Shut up. 
 For years and years, then pour it onto the plate. 
 Just shut up. 
 It's lost its lustre. 
 It's not even a vegetable anymore. 
 It's nothing. He's nothing. There's nothing left. 
 Just shut up. 
 He's like a Halloween pumpkin left out in the rain. 
 Shut up. 
 The kids are around going, "Give me lollies," but there's nothing in there, there's nothing at home. 
 I mean, he's been blanched into nothingness. 
 He's mush, mate. He's a complete vegie. 
 He's like flaccid celery. 
 Shut up, Glen. 
 There's nothing in there, 'cause he's gone. 
 He's like that weird juice... 
 Shut up. 
 You know that stuff that you go, "What the hell is that?!" 
 Shut up, Glen. 
 He's got minutes to live, mate. 
 He's gone. He's absolutely gone. 
 [DULL THUD] 
 [THUDDING CONTINUES] 
 Guys, are you there? 
 Yes, Jacob. We've been here all night. All night. 
 Are you hearing that? It's like a... 
 [GRUNTS] like a dull thudding sound. 
 [THUDDING] 
 Like a bag of potatoes being pushed... slammed up against, like, a metal surface. 
 You know what? I think we do hear that. 
 Um, okay. Well, listen. 
 We're gonna go investigate that sound for possibly the next two to three hours. 
 We're gonna need you to keep the airwaves completely silent while we do that. 
 But good work, Jacob. Please give yourself a pat on the back. 
 Yeah, all right, I will. 
 Are you doing it now? 
 Yep. [LAUGHS] 
 Say it. 
 I'm giving myself a pat on the back. 
 It's stopped.
