 Narrator : Previously on Continuum... 
 What the hell? 
 Sadler : Time traveler, hello? 
 Kiera : What year is this? 
 It's 2012. 
 Detective Carlos Fonnegra. 
 Linda Williams, Portland P.D. 
 Portland? 
 The revolution is on our schedule. 
 War begins now. 
 They shot their way in, six dead here. 
 Two in the alley. 
 Sadler : How old is your son, Kiera? 
 That's enough for tonight. 
 Kiera : 2077. 
 My time, my city, my family. 
 When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. 
 They had other plans. (EXPLOSION) A time-travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on was me. CPS official : Suit Operations is on your left. You'll dump your CMR there. See the APOC for an assignment. Firing range is upstairs. Sonic clean is down two. You follow? Down two. Yes, sir. This is the chip guy. You want me to do it? What? (GRUNTS) How does that feel? Good? Yeah. Hold your breath. Keep your eyes open. (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) (BEEPS) (SOFTLY) Wow. Is there a volume control for this thing? Just think it, it'll happen. It takes some getting used to. But with a CMR hard-wired into your cortex, you become a passive recorder of all that you see, hear and smell. It can hold up to 36 hours of vid. So, no more disputed testimony. No more bad arrests. If it was me, every man, woman and child in the Union would be chipped. Name and Tag Number. Cameron, Kiera. 11-6-914. One standard issue service weapon. One standard issue multitool. Sign here. (BEEPS) You're going to want to trust your gut out there, Cameron. Don't. Instincts are good, but what's gonna make you a great Protector is the tech. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Hold the elevator. Sadler :  Kiera? What, Alec? Sorry, just couldn't see your location there for a second. Is something wrong? No, I'm just upgrading my firmware here. Your system eats a lot of bandwidth so. Seems fine now. I look great. Yeah, you do. Boundaries, Alec. As a cop. My CMR is for business only. Why did you say that if you didn't want me to hear it? Sometimes I get nervous in social situations and I talk to myself. We'll figure it out. We're both new at this. We good? Route to the power station is clear. Lucas, device ready? It's good to go. Let's get ready to move out. I'm gonna find who did this to your dad, all right? I promise you. Linda. Sadler : Linda, Carlos is talking to you. Good morning. Oh. Hey, good morning. Any news? (SIGHS) Not a peep. They've gone underground. Yeah, Dillon wants to put together a joint task force. FBI, CSIS, RCMP all the letter agencies. Did you forget something? The funeral's today. I packed really quickly. I didn't bring dress clothes. Hey! Betty Robertson. Linda Williams. From Portland. Yeah. Carlos, do you need a ride to the cemetery? I'll see you there. You can tell her she's got nothing to worry about. Betty? You're a good-looking guy. You're just not my type. Yeah. Nothing to worry about, huh? Nope. Breakups are a bitch, aren't they? Yeah. He leave you? I left him. It's complicated. (SIGHS) Yeah, isn't it, always. Carlos. Come on, Inspector. (INAUDIBLE) Move your ass, Kellogg. We can eat on the other side. Kellog, get dressed. You deaf? Oh, sorry. My hearing is fine. Um... I, uh... I'm not going. One goes, we all go, Kellog. Or some of us go, or none of us go. Right? Tell them what you told me. Tell us what, Lucas? Kellog : That we got here fusion-powered but Lucas is trying to get us home on a 12 volt. Stop talking sh1t, Kellogg. Let the man speak. I've run the calculations a dozen times, the grid should be enough to bring about fusion and power the device, but really? I won't know for sure until I press the freaking button. Ingram : So back off. Then we move ahead, as planned. Listen guys, what if this is where we're supposed to be? You scared of another trip down the rabbit hole? No, but I see a reason to stay. Look around. What do you see? I see inequality, injustice, the rich getting richer. But freedoms still exist. The corporate rights act won't be imposed for another 50 years. We're free to tell people what's being done to them, and by who, and there's no one to arrest or execute us. Hell, even the President gets on TV and tells corporations and the rich to suck eggs. Pretty speech. But what are you really trying to say? He wants us all to stay. With our knowledge of the future, we can operate here, virtually unchallenged. The Protector knows we're here. She'll stop us. How do you even know you're gonna get us back to the right time? I made the calculations. We're good. Let's put it to a vote. Okay? Who wants to stay? Doesn't look like it's going your way, Kellogg. Let's move. Pass our brothers my regards. See you in 60 years. (PHONE RINGING) Is there a problem? Yeah, inspector wants to talk to you. Sir. This is Dan Barlow, Portland P.D. Sergeant Barlow says he works with a Linda Williams. You're not her. I can explain. You better be able to. Because if you're not Linda Williams, who the hell are you? What happens now? Carlos : Don't talk to me. Are you even a cop? Yes. You could have told me. That I share the same name as another detective named Linda Williams? Oh, yeah, what are the odds? 1.7 million Williams's at the time of the 2000 census. It's the third most common name in America. It's the third most common name in America. (SMIRKS) You know, I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt because you saved my life. Thanks. But that ends the minute you lie to me again. Understood. Okay. Now, is the part where you tell me who you really are and what you're doing here. That is need to know. Yeah, that's not gonna cut it. Am I under arrest? Not yet. Mind if I stand? (SCOFFS) Suit yourself. (SIGHS) Now what? Well now, we process you. (CLEARS THROAT) What happens when you process me? Well, I guess we're just gonna have to wait and find out now, aren't we? (WHISPERS) Alec. Wake up! What... Oh, you're talking to me? Okay, got it. Uh, processing is bad. He's going to run your prints. The cover I created for you is not gonna hold up. You going to run my prints, Carlos? I'm going to print you. I'm going to check your story. I'm gonna run you through NCIC and Interpol. Sadler : NCIC is the National Criminal Database. Interpol is an organization of world police forces focused on human trafficking, terrorism. What are you doing? That's how we're gonna solve the problem. H ow? With a thumb-print? With a truth they can accept. She seem bothered by any of this to you? She's cooperating. You get a name? No. Look, I'd be dead if it wasn't for her. I hear where you're going with that, but I need you to think for a second. She's always one step ahead of this gang. For all we know, she could be one of them. No, my gut is telling me something different. If you have a conflict of interest I need to know. I'm clear. You sure? There is no conflict. Okay. Take her downstairs. Process her. But, until we get some answers, all possibilities remain open. Including the ones we don't like. ID? It's been a hell of a day today, man. Can't wait until today is over. (WHISTLING) (MAN GRUNTS) Hey! You can't be in here! (TASER CRACKLING) (GRUNTS) (YELLS) Let's move. (SIGHS) (MACHINE WHIRRING) (ELECTRONIC WARBLING) (FIRE ALARM RINGING) Are you kidding me? You all right? We're stuck between floors. Just give it a minute. Emergency generators will kick in. Look, I'm claustrophobic. Yeah, right. (SIGHS) Dispatch : All units vicinity Hastings Substation, Hazmat team and a bus en-route containment perimeter, hazmat protocols... Hazmat? Hazardous materials. Hazardous material teams. How wide-spread is the outage? I don't know. I'm sure they're working on it. Sadler : Power's out across half the city. Look, you need to tell your team to check for an explosion with no bomb fragments or combustible residue. You think your gang has something to do with this? I need to see the Substation. Sadler : Understand. In case you hadn't noticed we're stuck in an elevator. Come on! I'm hacking into surveillance cameras at the Sub-Station now. (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) The Substation that was hit, is it nearby? Sadler :  East  6th and Clark. East 6th and Clark. We need to check it out. Correction, I will check it out. Once this elevator starts moving again, you are going to holding. (THUDDING) Finally! Jeez. (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) I'm not going to holding, Carlos. (SCOFFS) What part of "no", do you not... (GRUNTS) Sadler : No way. Did you actually just tase Carlos? That is awesome! Look, what I do isn't always gonna make sense to you. But it is important. And I can't do it without you. I can't have you following me when this wears off, so... Sorry. (CHUCKLES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) How do I make one of these function? Keys. Do you see any? Uh... (CAR ALARM BEEPS) No. Sadler : Cool! You shirt has a frequency generator? (CHUCKLES) You opened the trunk. Wait, wait, wait. The green one has a keyless ignition. Um, now what? Put your seat belt on, just in case, you know, or it will draw attention. (CHUCKLES) It's the strappy thing to your left. Okay, now press "Start". (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Now use the shifter. (CAR STEREO PLAYING) Uh, try the other handle. Have you ever driven a gasoline vehicle before? (MUSIC STOPS) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Foot on the brake! It is the left pedal, left pedal! (HORN HONKING) Put the shifter in D for drive. This is not a simulation. Not funny, Alec. (CHUCKLES) (BUZZER BLARING) (SIGHS) Be right back. Thank you, Mom. I'm starving! Alec, sweetheart! Sorry, I just... I've been really busy. New project. Yo, step-bro. All right then. Mom, is it okay if I eat this in the barn? Uh, sure. Here, do me a favor, okay. Bring in your dirty dishes in, so I don't have to buy any more. Okay. And get your chores done! Okay, thanks. Alec? I can't talk, busy. Oh. What got into him all of a sudden? I have no idea. But I do remember his father like that. So excited by his work. Here. Thanks, honey. Thanks. Sol understand you want to open an investment account, Mister... Uh, Kellog. How much did you plan to start with? All of it. 
 
 (ELEVATOR DINGS) Oh, don't act like you've never been handcuffed to an elevator before. A key would be nice. (SIREN WAILING) What happened? Someone broke his neck. Anything inside? I heard the cops say they tried to hack the grid. Shorted it and blew out the breakers from here to New West. Thanks. Oh, okay. The police just took an interest in me. What are they saying? Uh, tapping the police band. Okay, good news is that witnesses reported five people matching the description of the gang leaving the substation. Okay. Bad news is there's an APB out for you. Sadler : So, what will they do now? My hope is they locate a new power source. Hope, why? So I can track them. If they go underground and blend in, I may never find them again. You seem to know a lot about these people. Not them personally, people like them. Men and women who hate and kill to impose their views on anyone who disagrees with them. All right, well, this is a little rad, even for me. But I just sent you an image of Simon Fraser. He wrote an influential paper on the theoretical possibilities of creating a sustained series of thermonuclear micro-explosions  by beaming streams of charged ions at a pellet of Deuterium Tritium propellant. But we're looking for a time travel device, not a rocket. Yeah, but they may be powered the same way. Look, this is just speculation, but unlike a chemical or fission explosion, fusion reactions release about  four billion times more energy than the hydrogen oxygen mixture that powers the main engines on the space shuttle. And 100 times more than the fusion reactions that goes on at the Sun's core. Fraser's work involves finding a way to safely harness the energy of fusion reactions to,  in theory, make faster than light travel possible. Is this information public? (CHUCKLES) He's famous, he's on the cover of this month's Wired. What is that? It's a magazine. We have to get to him first. (DOORBELL CHIMING) Drop car turn up? No, but I got units running down all the ATM, bank and security cameras in the area. Plus, we are canvassing the neighborhood around the power station for any witnesses. Five heavily armed gunmen don't just disappear for Christ's sakes. Yes, I realize that. Look, this is hard on all of us. You vouched for her. You find her. Fix it. (SIGHS) You're hovering. I wanted to let you know I've been doing some digging. The Portland P.D. database was hacked by a third party server. That's good? Or bad, depending on who did the hacking. I'm following the Linda Williams trail back to the originating server. He or she is using TOR to encrypt their TCP streams and cover their tracks, but I've been following the gaps between incoming and outgoing packets and they're narrowing. So you're going to find out who's behind the curtain, right? Pretty soon, he's going to over-stay his welcome and I'm going to nail his ass. Good work. You're a good cop, Carlos. Thank you. But people are talking. Yeah. And I'm sure you're going to tell me what they're saying, aren't you? She's making you look like a fool. She's using you. Yeah. And you don't want to see that happen? No. I'm on your side. Actually, you know, there is something you could do for me. Anything. Find me the ID of that hacker. So on it. (DOORBELL CHIMING) Mrs. Fraser? Go away. I'm a colleague of your husband. Is he home? You need to go now. I'll call the police! I think that you and I both know the police are the last people you want to call right now. (SOBBING) They said if I told anyone where they took him, I'd never see him again. The longer you wait to tell me, the harder it's going to be for me to get him back. The Linear Collider at the University. Linear Collider? It's an atom smasher. High velocity particles, incredible amounts of energy. Kiera : Enough to power the device? I'm a genius and even I can't answer that question. But I'd bet the answer's yes. Kiera : I'm gonna need to take that phone. Take whatever you need. Please don't let them hurt him. Sadler : What's with the phone? We're going to need back up. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Fonnegra. Carlos? Linda? Where the hell are you? I need your help. My help? Okay. Come down to the station and turn yourself in. I'll see what I can do. (WHISPERS) It's her. Look, I know that's what you want. But I think I have something you might like even more. What's that? Okay, just... Linda? What? Linda said she is going to text us in 20 minutes with the address of where the gang is meeting. She says she's deep cover as one of them. She wants us to come and arrest her. Hello. Are you lost? Um, my family used to live there. Well, we live here now. Simon : I don't understand. What do you want with the Linear Collider? Wait, what are you doing? The tungsten receptors in the containment chamber are placed to collect the maximum energy from the colliding particles. Please. Tampering with the containment chamber can cause all kinds of catastrophic results. At least let me help you calibrate it properly. Ingram : I'll take it from here. Thousands of people live nearby... Get back! He's a scientist. Ingram : Engineer. In a field that doesn't even exist yet. I'm that good. We done with him? Give me a minute to test the system. (BEEPING) Simon : If you tell me what you want, I'll gladly make you required settings. Ingram : What we're doing isn't exactly in the owner's manual. Simon : You realize there is a real possibility that you could cause a complete system failure. Travis : You're going to have a system failure if you don't shut up. Simon : I know what I'm talking about. Travis : You know I'd listen to him, professor, you're not the only one here with a big brain. Dillon : She text you yet? (SIGHS) Not yet. But get this. The cell she used belongs to a woman whose husband works at the University. We called his office, they said he left hours ago. Did you try calling him? No answer. Sending a unit over to the house. Kiera : Alec, feed me a ground plan of the facility. (ALARM WAILING) Alec, there is an alarm going off, do you know what triggered it? Alec? Hey, I'm back! Kiera? Kiera? Why didn't you contact, Carlos? I'm not seeing any cavalry. I left him a trail of bread crumbs, he'll follow it. We haven't talked about your family in a while. Kiera : No, we haven't. Miss them? I think about them all the time. Is that why you left your cell phone back there? Yes. So Carlos follows you here, and you follow them there. Which for you will be home. I'm going to miss you, Alec. (SIGHS) You don't even know what you're going back to. But I have to try. It's all gonna work out. I know how this ends, remember? Carlos is going to be mad. He'll get over it. If we all go back, everybody here is safe. You really thought this through, huh? I want to go home. Power readings like that are impossible. Ingram : Billion Mega-volts in a sustained proton collision. That device is absorbing 100% of the energy. You haven't even seen the best part yet. I think the Doctor's seen enough for one night. Not if you want her to live. Any takers? Too bad. There are a couple of you that I wouldn't mind killing. (GRUNTS) Stay. Stay. Stay. Dr. Fraser, the sequence has begun, is there any way to stop it? There is an emergency override. (GUNSHOTS) Is there any other way to cut the power? Not until the cycle is complete. Excellent You may go. Oh, he's not going anywhere. I just added sparing him to the terms of our cease fire. Cease fire? Along with some discretion. Just until we get to where we're going. We? Bitch cop wants to come with us. Bitch cop does. Good. I'll take silence as agreement that my terms are acceptable. I'd shake on it, but that'd mean touching you. Go. Gutsy. Coming here, one against five. I'm counting on you all wanting to get home in one piece as much as I do. You know all bets are off when we get to the other side. Watch your back. You double check the settings? Double and triple. When the device powers up a portal opens. We go through to 2071. The year we were supposed to arrive in the first place. DO it! Okay. Everyone needs to come in closer. (DEVICE BEEPING) If you have to work catching bad guys, who's going to tuck me in? Nothing will change. So you'll be home? Yeah. Sometimes it will be me, and sometimes it will be dad. Okay. How about this? Every night when I come home, I will come in your room and kiss you. But I'll be asleep. I'll just have to wake you up. So you mean I get two tuck ins? (GROANING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) (GROANS) Travis : Sound off. Ingram : One piece. I'm good. Curtis : Intact. Ow. Ow. Travis : Where's the Protector? Cease fire's over. Lucas, get over here. Ow, ow! (GUNSHOT) Cops!! Travis : Lucas! Down! All right. Listen up! We're gonna flank them. We're going to head upstairs and see if we can draw their fire. You four, on me. Got them all! Travis : Curtis, cover me! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Travis : Lucas, way out? Way out? Outflow tubes. This way! Garza, cover! (GUN COCKS) Eat it! (LAUGHS) Yeah! (GROANS) Man down here! Cop : Get a medic over here now! We need to check in. Ingram : Travis, wait up! Travis! I don't know how to tell you this. Without the drum roll. I'm missing a piece. Move! This time the cuffs stay on Why is she under arrest? She isn't one of them. She's a hero. She saved my life. What else went down in there, Doctor? I stand by what I've said. (CAMERA CLICKS) Sam : So you mean I get two tuck-ins? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, you're getting two tuck-ins. I love you. You, too. Good night. Well, he's certainly happy. What? You promised to be honest with him. We both know the job, the nights you're not gonna make it home. Don't make promises you can't keep. That's not fair. How high is her cover? As high as it gets. Nice work. You don't seem happy. Special Agent Cameron. Get the cuffs off her. You know, you could have saved yourself a lot of trouble if you told me up-front that you were working for the Feds. But I do understand your need to keep things on a need to know. You do. (WHISPERS) Thanks. Don't thank me. It was your idea. We ran your file, and from what little we could access it appears that you have contacts that we seem to lack. I do. I'm planning on establishing a task force to take on this new threat. And we could really use someone with a deep understanding of its methods and tactics, Special Agent. Say something. I, uh... That's a yes. I could use some help until I get up to speed. Excellent I'm sure Detective Fonnegra won't mind. You two seem to complement each other. I can work with that. Carlos? Another yes. Great, we will see you tomorrow. The lady needs a place to hang her hat. (EXHALES) Lockers are down the hall. Simon at the front desk gives out the combos. Don't let him put you by the can. Can? Okay, got it. Coffee station, do not eat the doughnuts. Look, we got a lot of paperwork to fill out. Don't worry about it, we'll fill it out tomorrow. You got a service weapon? Not here. Okay. You can use my backup for now. Is this desk free? Yeah. Look, I don't know what you did, or how you did it. When we go looking for a file, we find exactly what it is we're looking for. Let's start fresh tomorrow. I'm all out of answers for tonight. Yeah, I can work with that. Need a lift? Go ahead, I might wanna clear my thoughts for a minute. Are you upset? Kiera : I have a husband and a son. And right now, I'm confronting the possibility that I may not make it back to them. I can't imagine how that must feel. The only thing that's going to get me through this is  finding a way to believe that my being here is for a reason. That what I'm doing will somehow help my family in the future while I'm here in the present. Yeah, sounds reasonable. I hope you're right. You want me to call you a taxi? Thanks. You're a taxi. That's a joke. I know. (SNIFFLES) Goodnight, Alec. Good night.
