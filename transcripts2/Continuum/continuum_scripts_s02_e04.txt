 Kiera :  Previously on  Continuum... 
 Escher : Change of plan. Kiera, you're with Elena in the chamber. 
 (EXPLOSION) 
 Man : Kiera! 
 We both know that you're not what you seem and I got a pretty good feeling those answers are gonna reveal themselves as long as someone is watching. 
 I am done getting my hands dirty. 
 He who will not yield to reason will yield to persuasion. 
 What will you do when that kind of persuasion comes looking for you? 
 Because it will. 
 Go! 
 CPS. Freeze! 
 Primary target. 
 Thermite detonators. 
 Go. 
 Put your weapons down, stay where you are. 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Tango down. 
 Searching for target. 
 Target obtained. 
 (GUNSHOTS) Elena? 
 Tango down. 
 Sam : Mom? 
 Wanna trade? 
 Mommy? 
 Hand me the detonator. 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Computer voice :  Training simulation terminated. 
 Escher : Why the hesitation, Cameron? 
 We acquired the target, sir. 
 Escher : Not good enough. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) 
 Elena : That's your problem right there. 
 Kiera : They have nothing to do with this. 
 We had this, and then you saw Sam. 
 I wasn't counting on my son being used in a SIM like that. 
 CPS uses your psych eval against you. 
 They know your weaknesses. 
 They think they do. 
 You didn't give me a chance to take down Verta. 
 I saved you. 
 You were reckless. 
 You froze. 
 Thanks for the support. 
 That's what this is, partner, whether you realize it or not. 
 Hey, hi sweetie! 
 You heard of Liber8? 
 Yeah. 
 Get out of the truck. 
 Get out! 
 Keep your hands up. 
 This isn't about you. 
 It's about big oil. 
 Tell the company you work for to stop ripping off the people. 
 Get outta here. 
 Get outta here! 
 (BEEPING) 
 Let's go! 
 (EXPLOSION) 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Go, go, go, go! 
 (TIRES SCREECHING) 
 Another one, Ladner Trunk Road. 
 That's seven in four hours. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 Well, it looks like your pals have found a new trajectory. 
 Catch me up. 
 Well, all the tankers are owned by Ultra Gas, they're targeted strikes and all the drivers were handed propaganda material. 
 That's smart. 
 Liber8 is trying to gain favor with the public by going after companies they already hate. 
 They've dressed themselves up like Robin Hood, the public is buying into it. 
 Social media is actually rooting for Liber8. 
 (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Kiera, are you there? 
 This is Cameron. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 Uh-huh. 
 (STATIC) 
 What is with the connection? 
 That's actually why I'm calling. 
 I've been experiencing this interference issue. 
 Kiera, listen. Do you remember the night that you landed? 
 Unlikely I'd forget it. 
 Well, when you crashed through 
 I knew something was up even before you called for backup. 
 How? 
 Random data suddenly  spiked up on my com-channel. 
 First, I thought it was static or interference, but now I know it came from you. 
 Random data, what are you talking about, Alec? 
 Let's call your arrival Hiroshima. 
 You get that? 
 We do have history in the future, you know. 
 Good. Then you know what Nagasaki is. 
 The second bomb to hit Japan. 
 You had another data spike. 
 Boom. 
 Are you sure? 
 Sure as I can be. 
 Someone else's future tech  just tried to access my network. 
 Similar to mine? 
 (SIGHING) Another time traveler is online. 
 You've got company. 
 Kiera :  2077. 
 My time, my city, my family. 
 When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. 
 They had other plans. 
 A time-travel device sent us all back 65 years. 
 I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. 
 Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. 
 What they didn't plan on was me. (THUNDER RUMBLING) You're positive it originated from this location? 49. 175 North, 122.586 West. It's as close as I can get. I've got it, looks like a garage sale. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (CHILDREN PLAYING) Dan : You look a little lost. Ah, well, 49 degrees North and 122 West, so no, not lost. Okay, now I'm lost. Oh, uh, Kiera Cameron. Vancouver PD. Have you seen anyone around here this morning unusual, or a little odd, maybe, uh, besides, besides me? The person that I'm looking for might have been wearing a very distinctive suit. Copper... Reflective... Most of this stuff is my mom's, but I do remember something like that. Or not. Or I did, but I sold it. I wish I could be more helpful. It's imperative that I find that suit. Uh! Could I speak with your mother? I mean, you said this stuff was hers. I don't know about that. It may be significant to the investigation. If you give me your number, I'll see. And that is not just an excuse to get your number. People need excuses? With good looking lady cops? Usually. You might be right. Might be? The data spike, it may have come from  another suit like mine. I knew it. (SIGHING) Thanks! Your welcome. Sorry... Everything okay? Yep. You have to track that spike. Alec, I need you on this. I'm barely operational  at my palatial digs, my mobile unit is a joke... Okay, so go home. I hacked into the Aldergrove weather radar  and paired it with a lighter network that I'm not supposed to know about. It's a weird combo, but it might work out if it happens again. You built a time travel app. (SIGHING) If you have to call it that. Wait, the traveler's already here so... What? If it happens again, I'll let you know, okay? Alec? I'm Emily. Meet to please you. Sorry. Alec. (LAUGHING) Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. (CHUCKLING) I've seen you in here before. I come here a lot. Ingram : Travis, oh Travis. Now you are going after gas stations. You know once people have to start lining up for fuel, they are going to be pissed at you. Yeah, he's using the attacks to spread Kagame's message. That's too smart for Travis. You always underestimated him. (SCOFFS) Clearly you did as well. How bad was it? Well, they hit ten fuel transports in the mainland all with the same message, big oil is enslaving the people, price gouging, raping the Earth, etcetera. Tapping into the public's growing sense of conspiracy. Yep. You know, for terrorists, they sure have a flair for PR. Think Sonya's behind this? The violence is more Travis's domain. (SIGHING) Maybe they got back together? I think it's safe to say they're still on the outs. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Well, whoever's behind this, they've sure got the public's attention. (SIGHING) Ah, Section 6 calling? Actually, no. You know, it's okay, I'm dating other police departments, too. Kiera Cameron. Hi. Great. I'll meet you there. Let me guess, going somewhere? Gotta see a guy about a suit. Rex : Um, it feels weird. Well, get out here and show me. You know, I could just use my med uniform, maybe throw a tux jacket over it? (EXHALING) Come on! That's fantastic! It's a dead ringer for Captain Armstrong's suit! (LAUGHING) It's a bit tight. We call that "form-fitting." Yeah, okay. You know, it's Patrick's big day, what if he goes as Armstrong? Patrick told me he's going to be General Carter. He can't resist those medals. Yeah. (SIGHING) Best five bucks I ever spent! Oh! I don't know. I think maybe Junior Medical Officer Keaton, that's more my speed. Be the hero, baby. You're mine. (IN A RUSSIAN ACCENT) And if you can't trust your Second Lieutenant Rosara, then who can you trust? I need to know you have my back, Rosara. You know I do, Captain, and when you're ready for more... Uh! Save it for the debrief... How long has your mother suffered from Alzheimer's? Six years. The doctor says she's done pretty well, considering. She's still there, you know. But sometimes I'm her son, other times... But this is palliative care. She in liver failure now. That's why we're here. I really appreciate you letting me come visit. Hopefully it's a good night. She really perked up when I mentioned you were looking for this suit. Hi, Mom, I brought that police officer we talked about. Hi, Mrs. Stanton. How are you feeling today? Partner! Yeah. You look just the same, Kiera. Elena? What took you so long? In the first months I looked for anyone else from the execution chamber that might have come through with me but... No one. No one. When did you get here? 1975. Look like everybody else, sound like everybody else, but you're a freak. Time traveler? No one understands, who can you tell? But you must have, I mean, you got married... I never told. I wanted to be normal. And my husband, he gave me that. And so much more. What about your husband, Kiera, and Sam? Didn't they come with you? Elena, when you came through, you were wearing your CPS uniform, right? Yes. Yes, so... I took it out kayaking, you know? I've loved that since I was a kid. I went out this morning. You all right, Mom? Mmm. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) He swore he was going to be Mederic. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEERING) You look great! (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Captain? Oh, at ease, General. I think I out-rank you. You may be in charge of this wedding, General, but I booked the restaurant. (LAUGHING) Glad you're here. Dude, it's your big day! (SIGHING) Two cutest comfort assassins in the room. Rex : Yeah. You guys um... Oh, well, you know... (SCOFFS) Every time she comes over, I'm still surprised. Rex, the girl loves you. Right, yeah, a college dropout. A guy that runs a dry-cleaning store. I don't think so. She sees the man. I'm glad she does. (SCOFFS) (GRUNTING) Rex! Ah! I'm on fire! Rex! Man : Get some water! Ah! Come on! (GASPING) You all right? Yeah! I am! I'm fine. Oh, you're so stupid! (LAUGHING) (BEEPING) What's the problem? I'm not sure and that's what worries me. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) She was always mysterious about her background. Said her life really started when she met my dad. That's sweet. How do you know her? Our mothers were friends. Elena helped out my mother more times than I can count. But she recognized you. They probably kept in touch. So, she got married, had a family... Dan : Four kids. Once we were all in school, so was she. She studied urban planning, then went to work for the city. He's boasting about me. Because you deserve it. I deserve chocolate. I'm old, and I'm cranky, and I want chocolate. I'm on it, Mom. Elena : My eldest. The younger ones are all married with kids. Not Dan. Do you have it on? Almost always. Does it make you feel safe? Elena, Alec Sadler is here. He's a teenage boy. You're sh1tting me. We connected the night I came through. Suddenly, he was just, in my head. All the time you were here, you never heard anything? I turned my CMR off years ago. I felt like it was always looking for voices that weren't there. It drained me. (CHUCKLING) I could have never made it through four kids with that thing turned on. What about your suit? I put it away in a box somewhere. I'm sorry. You couldn't have known. 
 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) We hit all five targets. Good. Make sure they're in and out in 10 minutes before the cops can react. Hey, we were professionals before you bought the franchise. I... I still think we should have it looked at. It's fine, I'm fine. No, it's weird. What kind of material doesn't burn? There are all kinds of flame retardant material out there. I guess you'd know. Dry-cleaning god that I am? That's not what I meant. (DOOR CHIMING) (MAN GRUNTING) Hey! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) I'm calling the cops. Man 2 : Get rid of this guy. (GRUNTING) Rex : Go! I hate heroes. You better get going, hero. Rex! Oh, my God! Rex! Oh, Rexy! (LAUGHING) Oh, you're such a bad dog! (GUNSHOTS) (SCREAMING) (GROANING) Whoa! Go closer! (REX PANTING) Get an ambulance! Travis : I want that. And get me those plates. Say please. Sonya : What's it mean? Remember, I found a way to track the protector but she shut us down... That code disruption. At first I thought it was Cameron but these data packets come from a different source. Someone else? Kagame came through weeks after us. This could be someone else from the execution chamber. Find them. Travis is choosing his targets well. It's like you two never broke up. I don't condone the violence. But the message doesn't suck. It's like he's trying to send you little love notes. I doubt that. You're really good to her. She deserves it. She's always been there for me. You know? Sadler :  The suit is active again. I've got coordinates. Have a good night. Good night. Man : Those guys were off their meds. It was chaos in here! Then, the guy walks in, takes two shots to the chest, and walks away. The place would have blown up if he wasn't here. He saved my life! Was he wearing something that resembled a uniform? Form-fitting, shiny? I don't know about that, but he sparked like an electrical storm when that asshole shot him. Hey, hey, hey, is he that superhero that's taking down Liber8? Gardiner : Was it, Miss Cameron? Someone wearing a super suit? Did you ever hear of anything like that? (CHUCKLING) Look at this ass clown. I mean, you can clearly see the Syndicate tattoo right there on his arm. I think I liked Travis more when anarchy was his end goal. He could really score some points with this endeavor. (SIGHING) Looks like Sonya might be rubbing off on him. He's still got his wild side, beatings, weapons... There's our hero. Excuse me. Kiera :  I thought you said there was only one event.  Missed one. You gotta get your head in the game, Alec. You mean your game? "Alec, track down the suit. " "Alec, find the bad guys. " You know how powerful these suits are. I don't need you to tell me about something I invented. You're right. I'm sorry. Is there any way we could track the suit if the owner wasn't wearing it? Well, the suit has certain latent functions on its own. Something called a positional contact relay. It's basically like a homing beacon. It'll ping the user's CMR and then you can triangulate the suit's location. What if it's out of power? That's doubtful, I mean these suits can draw a charge from any power source they come in contact with. Even kinetic energy can be absorbed. Can we turn it on with some sort of remote? Let me guess, someone's standing right beside you? Oh, crap. Exactly. So? Well, if you can find the actual traveler,  and get them to turn on their CMR, then we could link it to the suit and send a steady signal. Any idea how to find them? I'll call you back. Gotta go visit a sick friend. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) (CHUCKLING) Your garage sale guy did not know what he was selling. Maybe he did. You gonna give me one of your Rosara speeches? Captain, save the jokes for the epilogue? This is not a TV show. This is your life. You were shot! And now you think you're invulnerable because of that stupid costume! You saw what happened. Yeah. The wedding? I should have been burned! When I put that thing on, something happens, something bigger than me, I saved that guy's life! What about yours? Okay. Okay, look. It was a fluke. I'll get rid of it. Okay. It just feels like the world's gone crazy. Make sure you don't. (SIGHING) What do you want? Well, you shouldn't have to drive alone to see a sick friend. (INHALES) Look. We have mutual interests stopping Liber8, restoring order... Why don't we just help each other? I don't think our methods are compatible. I'm sure you could talk to your Mr. Escher and let him know I'm one of the good guys, no? Ah, so it's Escher you really want. Well, he's the one pulling your strings, isn't he? You seem to think so. (INHALES) Tell you what, let's drive over to Piron Corps right now, we can all sit around and talk about Section 6? Maybe after I visit my sick friend. You're connected to these terrorists. Maybe just in the way that a good agent becomes close to whoever he or she is tracking. But, until you get truthful with me, we're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Hmm. Our first date. (SCOFFS) It's not starting well. Well, next time I'll bring flowers. Come on. (ENGINE STARTING) (DOOR OPENING) Beth! Oh, Beth, you brought your husband. Yes, I did! He really wanted to say hi. Didn't you, honey? It's so good to see you, you look well. Are you still a marine biologist, Ben? I remember the dolphins. So pink. Mmm, hmm, in China well they're so memorable. I'll be outside. Excuse me. (SIGHING) You are sharp as a tack. Who's the asshole? Federal agent. He thinks I'm special. He's right. Listen, partner. I think Liber8 knows about your suit. I can't let them get their hands on it, and I need you to help me find it. I don't know what I can do from this bed. Can you turn on your CMR? If you can connect with the suit, Alec can trace it, it's like a homing beacon. Uh... Turn it on... It didn't feel good. I know it makes you nervous, but when we were together during the wars, I always felt safer with you as my partner. It's been too long. You were always the strong one. Not anymore. It scares me. I know. But I'm right here with you. (BREATHING DEEPLY) All right. Do it. Go ahead, Alec. Sadler :  You sure? Yeah. What about your new boyfriend? I can handle him. Okay, here goes. I'm cycling all other CMRs. (BEEPING) (GRUNTING) Elena? I forgot how it feels. It's so powerful. When I find the suit, I'll switch it off. There it is, I've got it. I'll get an address. (BEEPING) Sonya, it's live again. You do have a partner. Carlos is my partner. He's a good cop. I'll be the judge of that, when I meet him. I'll see what I can do. You should go. You ready to lay down some cover? Deal me in. (STATIC) Yes, everyone. Where is she? Where is she? Escher? You're looking for Escher, the mystery man? You don't know anything. I'm here, she's not. You wanna roll the dice? Come on out, hero. Strip down now, I'll go easier on you. (GRUNTING) Pretty hand, shame to detach it. (GRUNTING) (GUNSHOTS) Are you hurt? Well, you shot me! Yes, but you're not hurt. Perfect. That suit won't protect you forever. (GUN CLICKING) Sonya : Drop the gun. This again. You're not gonna shoot me. You'd have already pulled that trigger. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) You've been busy. Take off the suit, you might live! You don't need that uniform. Need. Want. Semantics. (GRUNTING) (GUNSHOTS) (GRUNTING) Ah! (STEAM HISSING) (SCREAMING) Put it down, and you get to walk away. Is that what you told Travis before you shot him? You're a lot smarter than I give you credit for, Garza. It's not too late to reconsider. You made my bed, I like lying in it. I don't want to hurt you. (GUNSHOTS) sh1t! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) Let's move! (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOT) (GRUNTING) We gotta go! (GUNSHOTS) (REX GRUNTING) Damn it! (CELL PHONE AUTO-DIALING) Civilian down, I need an ambulance. Suspects heading East from 95 Parker. You've got one, too? Shh, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. Rest. We're getting you help. I thought it would make me a hero. You don't need a suit for that. (SIRENS WAILING) Okay. Okay... Okay, all right, okay, okay. Okay... Okay, I'm just going to open the... (SOBBING) Rex... Is he okay? Ma'am. Agent Gardiner. Where's the suit? Where's the suit? Was he wearing the suit? Go away! Was he wearing the suit? Stop! Don't shout at her. Save it for the debrief. Here you go. You're bringing this here? Is this some sort of elaborate attempt to get rid of me? I deactivated it, there's no signal. I knew you'd wanna play with it. Plus, I don't think this place is on Liber8's radar, so you should be safe. This place is only temporary. How temporary? I don't know, we'll see. Look, I kinda have some stuff to do. Like what? All right... You have a life. Trying to. (SIGHING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Alec! (CHUCKLING) Hey! Hey, sorry I'm late. No, I just got here myself. (BOTH LAUGHING) What? You lost a bet, right? You forgot to save a country from a burgeoning debt crisis and this was your punishment? To date below your level? Right, because smart and funny is such a step down. Do I really seem like a date-a-jock kind of girl to you? I don't know, I'm just thinking about the fact you called me smart and funny. Oh, but there's plenty of time for you to disabuse me of that notion. Well, I'll give it my best shot. I guess you drink coffee? Um, yes... What kind of coffee? Carlos : Are you sure this is okay? Kiera : Yeah. Just a heads up, she's a little scattered, she might say some things that don't make sense but she insisted on meeting you. I think she wants to check you out. (CHUCKLING) Sounds like a good friend. She's more than a friend. Thanks for the support. That's what partners do. Hi. It's okay. Dan, this is Detective Fonnegra. Nice to meet you. Likewise. We managed to get most of the family here, she knew us all. Remembered everything. Never checked out, not even for a second. She came back for most of the night. But she wasn't even that sick? The doctors said that kind of resurgence isn't unusual just before death. I'm so sorry. Dan : Don't be. We had a beautiful goodbye. You were a tonic for her. I don't know if that's true. She said you should have this. She must have read it a dozen times. Only Connect. It's a little sermon, really, about ending isolation. She wanted you to know that she loved her life, and you can too. Excuse me. I'm sorry for your loss. Sure you don't want to go out there with them? Who would have imagined, she has such a beautiful family. (SIGHING) Am I ever going to meet your family? You have no idea how much I would love that. Have you seen your son lately? Oh, yeah... (SOBBING) I see him all the time.
