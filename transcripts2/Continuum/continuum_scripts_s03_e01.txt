 Previously on Continuum... 
 What the hell? 
 Tell me everything. 
 My name is Kiera Cameron, and I came here from the year 2077. 
 Who is this? 
 CPS Officer Cameron. 
 How are you in my head? 
 How are you on my computer? 
 Evolution is on our schedule. 
 The war begins now. 
 Alec. 
 You lost a bet, right? 
 Right, because smart and funny is such a step down? 
 Emily, it's ok. 
 I love you, too. 
 You know who else will be heartbroken? 
 Alec, after he learns you work for Escher. 
 I need you to pull me out. 
 He loves you, and you love him. 
 You'll stay on the contract. 
 Where's Alec Sadler? 
 It's me. 
 I need a clean up on location one. 
 You call them "freelancers". 
 They have tattoos. 
 It's a series of dots between their fingers. 
 What do they want? 
 I swore an oath to protect the world from those who would abuse technology to pervert and exploit the past, the present, and the future. 
 I have to accept the truth. 
 That I may never get back to him. 
 It doesn't mean I have to stop trying. 
 You don't get to dictate the terms of our little arrangement. 
 Ugh!!!! 
 We came back here to change things, not embrace them. 
 I've always had trouble with my past. 
 It looks like some of it is catching up with me. 
 Do you know where you're gonna go? 
 Probably Thailand? 
 Really? You have to hop on a plane right now? 
 That flight has been delayed. 
 Travis got into the lab. 
 You gave him access. 
 He's going after Escher, he needed the suit! 
 Please don't hurt her! 
 Too late. 
 Guns down, now! 
 Acquire the targets. 
 [gunfire] 
 Run! Run! 
 Emily! 
 [Gunshot] 
 She's dead, you asshole. 
 And I hold you responsible. 
 Alec doesn't know how dangerous Escher is. 
 Kiera, you were right about everything. 
 Emily, Escher... he told me he installed an anti-matter machine here at Pyron. 
 If you can somehow get the time travel device, I'll be able to send you home and this whole nightmare will be over. 
 Are you sure you can do this? 
 Let's find out. 
 How much time do we have before Escher figures out what we're up to? 
 I'm sorry, Kiera. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm protecting my family. 
 Alec, he is not family. 
 He is a threat. 
 He's my father. 
 Time travel's not just some technological marvel, Kiera. 
 It's the family business. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Stay where you are. 
 I can make things right. 
 And then I will destroy the device and nobody will ever use it again. 
 That's all I've ever wanted. 
 To put the pieces back together and return to my family. 
 That might be true, but there'll still be an anomaly. 
 A glitch in the continuum. 
 You. 
 Alec! I can go home! 
 I know. 
 But I have to save her. 
 No! 
 Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Call security. 
 Ugh!!!!! 
 Oh god, oh god. 
 What about Lucas? 
 It's being arranged. 
 The damage has passed. 
 Except for Sadler. 
 He's no longer our concern. 
 In this timeline. 
 [beginning to sob] 
 [muttering] I killed you. You're dead. 
 I killed you. 
 You're dead. 
 I killed you. 
 I killed you! 
 [yelling] 
 I'm sure you have a lot of questions. 
 I don't have time to get into details. 
 We slipped up. 
 You slipped up. 
 Me? 
 You let him manipulate you. 
 You let him use you. 
 Escher? 
 Alec Sadler. 
 Where is Alec? 
 Not where, when. 
 You know him. 
 You know the chain of events that pushed him to this point to betray you. 
 To use the time travel device for his own needs instead of sending you home. 
 So I need to ask you specifically: when is he? 
 [Panting out of breath] 
 Holy sh1t, it worked. 
 Emily. 
 Emily. 
 He went back to save Emily. 
 I need specifics! 
 I don't have them. 
 Sequence of events leading up to her death. 
 You should know them, your people killed her. 
 Just answer the question! 
 We can always use other methods. 
 A week, maybe. 
 Kellogg let Travis into the lab. 
 Emily and Alec escaped, went to Jason's. 
 That's where I ran into them and then your people showed up. 
 It's confusing. 
 She's ready. 
 How are you alive? 
 I killed you. 
 I remember. 
 Soon you'll know everything I know. 
 Soon you'll see the battlefield for the first time. 
 Battlefield? 
 This is a war, Kiera. 
 And every war has one thing in common with every other war. 
 Death. 
 And sacrifice. 
 sh1t! 
 Who are you? 
 Jason. 
 Who are you? 
 Who am I? 
 I'm your father. 
 Don't say that, that's private! 
 I mean, who are you? 
 I'm me! 
 I'm from the future. 
 Nah, I'm from the future. 
 The future a week from now. 
 Oh, are you sure? 
 Yeah, pretty sure. 
 So then you're here to change things? 
 Yes, yes. 
 Emily is in danger, ok? 
 I need to change things a little, a tweak here, a push there. 
 Keep Emily from getting killed. 
 What? 
 And then I'll deal with Escher. 
 Escher. 
 Can I help you? 
 How can I help you? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 I'm Katherine. 
 I'm the keeper of this cell. 
 Head freelancer? 
 If you like. 
 The dead man tells me I'm going to get some answers. 
 Curtis is of the opinion I'm wasting my time with you. 
 Try me. 
 One hundred years after you were born, a war started. 
 Will start. 
 This is not a war for land or wealth, this is a war for everything. 
 Time travel is Pandora's box, Kiera. 
 Shortly after you left your time, technology found its way into the hands of criminals who saw only opportunity. 
 It's a popular strategy, going back in time for selfish reasons. 
 Laws were passed and the technology was confiscated, but some damage had already been done. 
 The only way to prevent these abuses was to put in place a safety net that was built around an idea. 
 A common desire to protect history. 
 We would react to these incursions and minimize their impact. 
 One man made the sacrifice to journey back 1000 years to establish an order. 
 A temple of a sort. 
 He built a following that would evolve over time, always ready to neutralize these threats from the future as they became apparent. 
 Sounds like a cult. 
 Myself, people you see here, we are simply guardians of history. 
 We are just like you, trying to prevent injustice and criminal abuses. 
 You're not from the future? 
 No, and we encourage our members to avoid time travel, unless it has been approved for strategic purposes. 
 You could have put an end to all of this at the execution. 
 That would be suicide. 
 Against my belief system. 
 You just mentioned sacrifice. 
 The important part of all of this, the part that concerns you personally, Kiera... 
 Destiny is not set. 
 Time is not immutable. 
 The continuum is like a tree. 
 It can grow wild, or it can be cultivated. 
 We are on the red side of the tree. 
 When your young friend Alec used his time travel weapon, he created a whole new branch of the continuum. 
 A new story. 
 He no longer exists in this time line. 
 Do you know what that means? 
 He'll never grow up to be the Alec Sadler of 2077. 
 He will never create his empire. 
 Your future. 
 It means that, in a roundabout way, we are all now fighting for the same thing, Kiera. 
 Continuity. 
 For us, it means the tree will remain cultivated and healthy. 
 For you, it means you can return to your family. 
 But that might never happen now. 
 By allowing Alec to travel back, we've all become complicit in a crime. 
 And unfortunately, due to the nature of this crime, there's not much my people can do. 
 But you, on the other hand. 
 You might be able to correct this mistake and get home to your loved ones. 
 I'm still listening. 
 Hello? 
 Anybody? 
 Anybody here? 
 We don't have much time. 
 What're you doing? 
 I'm disabling all the CCTV surveillance in this place. 
 I can't be spotted. 
 I also have to keep tabs on other me. 
 I can do that by tracking his cell phone. 
 Oh and get the suit. 
 Ooh, what happened to your face? 
 Huh? 
 Your uh, your face. 
 What, is it bad? 
 It's actually kind of badass. 
 What happened, did you get into a fight? 
 Huh? 
 Sort of. 
 It's complicated. 
 It always is. 
 You ok? 
 Yeah. 
 Ok. 
 So listen, we need to talk about... 
 No, you listen. 
 Excuse me? 
 Look, I don't know what kind of messed up scheme you're planning with Sonia and Travis, but it's not happening anymore. 
 I'm changing all the door codes and getting rid of that other CPS suit so you won't be leveraging that or anything else to save your own skin. 
 Understood? 
 Um, I would never... 
 Trust me, you already did. 
 Ok, slow down. 
 What's all this about, kid? 
 You seem a little rattled. 
 Not yourself. 
 I can't talk about it. 
 Is something going on with your girlfriend? 
 You stay away from Emily. 
 She's not really my type. 
 Besides, I found out some things... 
 Stay away. 
 Fine, I'll stay away. 
 But you need to know... 
 I already know what I need to know. 
 Ok, you're scaring me. 
 Yeah? 
 Mmmhmm. 
 You want to protect your future? 
 You know I do. 
 Then start focusing on the real threat. 
 Escher. 
 In a few hours, Kiera's going to arrest Lucas and recover the rest of the time travel device. 
 Is that right? 
 So... 
 So if Escher gets his hands on it he will use it. 
 Ok. 
 Sure. 
 But without an adequate power source, he's... 
 He's got one. 
 Escher built an anti-matter lab at Pyron designed specifically for the time travel device that you and Liber8 brought back. 
 You're supposed to be so smart, you do the math. 
 Ok, so what. 
 Escher goes back to the time we all arrived and kills us all. 
 After that, well, I guess the world's his oyster. 
 That's how you stay on top? 
 So you and your friends are supposed to protect the time line. 
 That's right, and we've been doing just that for a thousand years. 
 Didn't everything get screwed up when I came back here with Liber8? 
 Wasn't a new branch of your tree created at that point? 
 Indeed. 
 And the reason we were collecting people like you and Liber8 was so we could repair the damage you've caused. 
 Were collecting? 
 That is no longer a viable option. 
 Alec has caused a much larger problem. 
 But if everything's already gone haywire, how am I supposed to make a difference? 
 That's just it, Kiera. 
 When it comes to history, the scale is irrelevant. 
 Thousands can perish and nothing will happen. 
 But one person can radically shape history. 
 Alec Sadler is one of those people. 
 Maybe you are, too. 
 I think you're all out of your minds. 
 I think you're delusional. 
 Kiera. 
 You killed Agent Gardner, positioned me to take the blame in order to get me out of the way, and now you want to be friends? 
 Things changed. 
 I'll say. 
 Let me go, and I'll think about it. 
 We can't let you go. 
 Don't miss out on an opportunity to help yourself, Kiera. 
 Help everyone. 
 I think we're done here. 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [fighting grunts] 
 Ahhhh!!!!! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [gunshots] 
 [gasping for air] 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Let's grab what we can and book. 
 Who are they? 
 Why do you think I know? 
 A hunch? 
 They seem to be interested in you. 
 Some kind of cult. 
 From as near as I can tell, they've kept the lid on time travel for as far back as you can go. 
 Formed some kind of secret society to stop people from changing history. 
 We should burn this place to the ground. 
 What about the others? 
 There's no time. 
 This place will be on lock down any minute. 
 You in or out? 
 What about us? 
 When we get out of here? 
 You don't mess with me, I won't mess with you. 
 I warned you she'd be difficult. 
 She's CPS, she's not gonna wake up as easily as you think. 
 They've been brainwashed to think a certain way. 
 She'll eventually see the logic. 
 By then it'll be too late. 
 I told you killing Gardner was a mistake. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 There are more important considerations for Kiera. 
 Leave it to me. 
 She's a mother. 
 You wouldn't understand. 
 
 
 
 (Over PA): Unauthorized exit, sector one. We have a security breach. 
 [alarm buzzing] 
 Hey, you realize you change one thing a whole bunch of stuff is gonna change because of it. 
 It occurred to me. 
 Yeah, well you might want to be careful about what you change because... 
 Gotcha! 
 Alec? 
 Hello? 
 Okay... 
 We shouldn't... 
 Yeah. 
 Shh! 
 [whispers] Go!!! 
 [fighting grunts] 
 [Gunshot] 
 We should double back. 
 Throw them off. 
 They'll go past, we'll keep them ahead of us. 
 Exactly. 
 You're acting weird. 
 Can't a guy admire his beautiful girlfriend? 
 I suppose. 
 What happened to your head? 
 Oh, I took a pretty good bump. 
 Knocked me out, even. 
 I've been forgetting things, too, so if you see me and I forgot everything since last time, that's probably why. 
 Uh huh. 
 Uh, so Thailand. 
 Excuse me? 
 We should go. 
 I've always wanted to go to Thailand. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Great minds think alike. 
 When do you want to go? 
 Hold on, you're serious? 
 I am. 
 What? 
 Listen, I need to tell you something. 
 It's ok. 
 Whatever you need to tell me won't change the way I feel about you or change my mind about leaving. 
 Now I gotta go take care of things, I'll call you, ok? 
 This is gonna work. 
 Kiera. 
 Nice maneuver. 
 Pulled something similar back in the rebellion only it worked out backwards. 
 How's that? 
 I ran the same flanking maneuver by my lieutenant, he thought it was a great idea, only we did an end run. 
 I got caught in the rear and fell behind. 
 I watched as my entire squad got captured and taken prisoner. 
 I only escaped because I fell, I was stupid. 
 Stupid saved your ass. 
 That time. 
 This place is a maze. 
 And it's full of rats. 
 sh1t!! 
 [Gunshots] 
 That is going to attract some attention. 
 They're gonna find us. 
 I'll divert, stall them and give you a chance to escape. 
 No, I'll do it. 
 Garza. 
 You can bring the cops. 
 Stupid won't save my ass this time. 
 Alright, I'll come back here with the police, bust you out, and we'll shut down this operation. 
 I can trust you, right? 
 I will come back with help. 
 What was that? 
 Time to move. 
 Give me ten seconds to draw them, and then go. 
 Hurry back, now. 
 There she is! 
 sh1t!! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Ahhhhh!!!!!!!! 
 Over there! 
 Target down!! 
 Moving on her!!!! 
 Grab her!!! [struggling grunts] Don't move!!! [thunder and lightning] [fighting grunts] [thunder and lightning] [thunder and lightning] Garza? Dead. I suppose it doesn't matter now. You can't escape your fate, Kiera. [electrical charges] Neither can we. What's going on? This time line is starting to collapse. It will die, and so will we. Nothing can change that now. You told me I could make a difference. You told me I could help myself, that I could get back to my family. You can. How? I can show you. Think of this as a life boat. Seriously? I'm supposed to get in this thing? It's perfectly safe. Have you used it? No. Then how do you know it's safe? This technology has been around for hundreds of years. It's a distant cousin to the time travel device that brought you here. That's really not making me feel better about this situation. If I'm wrong, either way you're dead. And if you're right, I get in this thing, I get to live and everything in this time line dies. Nothing can change that now! But you can set things right. Make sure Alec doesn't rob you of your future or your chance to get home, Kiera. There has to be another way. There isn't. This is the only way to get what you want, and in a way, the only chance we have to survive, too. Or some version of us. You don't belong in this time. That I know. Neither does the other you. I'm sorry, the other me? The Kiera that now exists in Alec's new time line. Do you have anything for me? Kiera thinks that Lucas is behind it and can intercept. Julian Randal just walked out of here because I don't have a damned thing I can hold him on. I just yanked the next possible mayor of this city in for interrogation, but I can't hold him because the prosecutors can't agree on charges. Somebody's head needs to be delivered. [Door slams] [elevator ding] Check it out. My god, are you ok? Uh, yeah. It's just a little bump. Um, I don't have much time. I have some intel. Well, don't keep us in suspense. First off, you'll find Lucas in his van underneath your favourite bridge. You know that one that blew up when he first arrived? I'll get an ERT on this ASAP. We should move quickly. Two Alecs, two of me. I would highly recommend avoiding the other you at all costs. What if she's the only one I can count on? There are some uncomfortable considerations to face if you're looking for solutions. Solutions? I'm sorry, what does that mean, solutions? Look, I'm not in a position to make predictions. That's a bit vague. I know and I'll explain. But first I'm gonna need your hand. Also, don't bother looking for Agent Gardner. He's been murdered. What? You can blame the freelancers. They're gonna pin it on you if you don't get ahead of this. Where is all this coming from? It's complicated. Really? Look, it doesn't matter. I have to go. Alec... I'm worried about you. What's going on? Some things may not make sense in the next few days. All you need to know is that I'm sorry for what I did. Hey Kiera... Alec... the ERT is mobilizing, let's go. [sirens wailing] Hold it right there! Get out of the van, now! Keep your hands in the air! Come on. You're not as smart as you think you are, huh? Surround the perimeter. Is that what I think it is? Yeah. It's a little more advanced than the one you're used to. I'm aware of that. We have to get moving. We're losing our window of opportunity. I will fix this. You have to. Even as we speak Alec is changing the course of history whether he knows it or not. I get it. Good luck. Ugh!! How did you find me? I think we both know it wasn't easy. Well I hope it's worth the trouble. Yours and mine. I don't think we've been properly introduced. My name is... I know who you are. What can I do for you? Well, it seems you and I have mutual interests. I wouldn't know. Uh, Alec Sadler. Anti-matter. Time travel. I've got this sick feeling we're both working from the same play book. If that were true? Well, if we keep stepping on each other's toes, Mr. Escher, sooner or later one of us is bound to get annoyed and push back. My money's on me, by the way. I'll take those odds. This confidence is just a facade for you, isn't it? Somewhere to hide. But you can't hide forever. I'm not hiding. Matthew. I'm right here. And I'm counting on you staying right here. [Gunshots] [out of breath] You? Keep it down, Garza. What are you doing? Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you? Do you? That's what I'm doing right now. Listen to me. Down the hall you'll find some tunnels. Make a left at the first intersection, follow the sound of water. It'll lead you to a spillway, and your freedom. What about you? I'm gonna distract them while you get away. Who are these people? Look, it's a long story and I don't have time to tell it to you. Suffice to say they have much bigger problems now than worrying about you and Liber8. No, that's not enough! Garza, go. And don't get caught. I won't forget this. Fine by me. Show me your hands, Kiera. I surrender. Hello, Katherine. Have we met? We've met. I don't think so. In another time line. Keep talking. Perhaps it's best if I show you. She's telling the truth. Codes are authenticated. By you. Why did you let Garza escape? An old debt. Plus you told me you have bigger issues to deal with than Liber8. I did. There are two Alec Sadlers in this time line. What else did I tell you, Kiera? To make things right, that we want the same thing, to protect the future. First, you dismantle your plan to frame me for Gardner's murder. I'm no good to you as a fugitive. And then? Two Alec Sadlers means two possible futures, and I have to determine which Alec Sadler will bring forth the future that you and I both want. And what happens to the other? Oh, Kiera. No. No! [sobbing] No! I changed things. [sobbing] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
