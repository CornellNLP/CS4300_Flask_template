 Narrator :  Previously on  Continuum... 
 Thought I'd let you sleep in. 
 This didn't happen . And it'll never happen again. 
 There's some pinhead CSIS agent here. 
 It's Gardiner here, I want you to run a check on an outfit called Section 6. 
 You know, I protected you and you lied to me. 
 Martin : It was politics, it wasn't personal. 
 Congratulations on your win. 
 We're done. 
 Wait, I know you, blue eyes. Yeah. 
 You were at the execution. 
 You're just like me. 
 You're from the future! 
 So what exactly are we dealing with here? 
 2,000 pounds of classified gel concentrate. 
 Military grade. 
 We will write history together, brother. 
 This battle isn't over. 
 It's hardly begun. 
 We will meet again. 
 You know there are other time jumpers here. 
 No, I'm talking about the Privateers. 
 The, uh, Freelancers. 
 Mr. Escher. 
 The truth is, I'm the one that sent you back in time. 
 And you're not going to believe why. 
 You followed me? 
 Where's Kagame? 
 Kagame was in the building when it exploded. 
 He also told me that after he died today, he wanted me to do something important. 
 He wanted me to succeed him. 
 (GASPING) 
 (CRIES OUT) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (DOOR LOCKS) 
 No. No. 
 Somebody... 
 Somebody let me out! 
 Let me out! 
 God! No! 
 No! 
 Kiera! Are you okay? 
 My head is killing me. 
 Okay. Um, let me get you something. 
 I've got some meds in my travel kit. 
 It feels like something went wrong with my CMR. 
 Your CMR? 
 Mom? 
 Oh, sweetie, come here! 
 I'm fine. I didn't mean to wake you up. 
 I don't know, a download went wrong or a chip failure. 
 Don't worry, it's getting better already, I promise. 
 Can we talk about this? 
 I don't think so. 
 Kagame was very specific. 
 I take over Liber8. 
 I have no doubt. 
 You've proved your loyalty time and time again. 
 But I want you to think more about what that loyalty means. 
 You can't do this. 
 I know you're better than Kagame. 
 You can't do this, not to me. 
 If you can't be with the person you chose to... 
 (GUN CLICKING) 
 sh1t. 
 (EKG BEEPING) 
 Doctor : Clear! 
 No change. 
 Doctor : Charge of 300. 
 And clear. 
 Nothing. 
 (EKG GOES SILENT) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Call it. 
 Somebody write up the paperwork. 
 Good effort, guys. 
 (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) 
 What the hell is that? 
 (WHIRRING) 
 (EKG BEEPING) 
 (GASPS) 
 Get out of the way, you guys! 
 Man 2 : Out of the way, out of the way! 
 Man 3 : Move it! 
 Move it! 
 Argh! 
 Sonya! 
 Hey! 
 Sorry guys, authorized personnel only. 
 It's cool, we've got authorization. 
 You saw nothing. 
 Are we clear? 
 Then run. 
 That the last one? 
 Yep. 
 Sorry I couldn't help more, man. 
 We went through a major raid in Warcraft and. . you know how it is. 
 Yeah. 
 So what's with this last-minute move, anyway? 
 Problems at home? 
 I just needed a change. 
 Oh, hey, uh... 
 So, um... 
 Oh, yeah. Right, sorry. 
 I forgot. 
 I'm a little short, I'm gonna have to hit an ATM tomorrow. 
 (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) 
 Alec, it's me. 
 This is my fourth message. 
 Maybe your phone's not working. 
 We should really talk about the message from you, you know who. 
 Call me back. 
 What message? 
 (SIGHS) Please don't do that. 
 You wanted to see me, here I am. 
 And I should be grateful? 
 Well, considering the ignominious way you used me and then tossed me away, I'd say uh... 
 I'd say yeah, grateful would be an acceptable response. 
 I'd say it's the pot calling the kettle black. 
 Really? You show up on my boat after the explosion, I take you in, no questions asked, you spend a few days laying low... 
 Hi, can I, uh... I'll have what she's having, please. Thank you. 
 And then you disappear in the middle of the night and you call me up and you act like nothing happened. 
 'Cause nothing did happen. 
 And why do I feel like you are usually the one being characterized this way? 
 Perhaps my bad behavior is simply masking a... deep insecurity. 
 It cripples me, you know, emotionally. 
 You are much more evolved than that! 
 At least I thought so. 
 Thank you. 
 What's this message about, anyway? 
 So. Why am I here? 
 A time travel device sent you and seven other terrorists 65 years back in time to foster worldwide revolution against the corporations. 
 Nice. 
 I meant here in this bar. 
 Couple of reasons. 
 First, Liber8. 
 Kagame accomplished his mission, apparently. 
 With Travis captured and Sonya in control, what's next? 
 Well, it's a multi-layered approach to. 
 . . How'd you put it? 
 Revolution against the corporations. 
 It's gonna take time, you know, to infiltrate the criminal world, the business world, the political world... 
 What's reason number two? 
 I need money. 
 Oh, but that's... 
 That's really interesting because I happen to have quite a lot of it these days. 
 Yeah, because of me. 
 Because of you? 
 And how's that? 
 I could've had you arrested, I didn't. 
 I covered for you, and here you are. 
 Rich, alive and free. 
 Are you blackmailing me? 
 Mm. 
 Well, I have to say, this only makes you more attractive. 
 The game is changing, Kellog. 
 The future might be in play, you want history to turn out like it should, so do I. 
 I want to go home to my family, I want Liber8 to fail, and I will do everything to ensure that happens. 
 How do you know the future hasn't already been changed? 
 You know what they say, right? He who pays the piper calls the... 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 What? 
 I was just starting to get over you. 
 Sorry. 
 This way, Madam Mayor. 
 What should I expect? 
 They're going to focus on the City Plaza bombing and the fact that Liber8 is still out there operating. 
 Be sure to mention the arrest of Julian Randol and Travis Verta and the death of Edouard Kagame. 
 Spin these as solid accomplishments. 
 They're gonna ask about the Liber8 links to organized crime and I've got nothing on that. 
 Say the police are following up with some solid leads. 
 Are they? They don't have anything yet, but the press doesn't know that. 
 Okay. 
 How do I look? 
 Like someone headed for higher office. 
 Let's do this. 
 (REPORTERS CLAMORING) 
 I have a brief statement to make, and then I'll take your questions. 
 (GUN FIRES) 
 (SCREAMING) 
 I understand, but don't you forget this department put Travis Verta behind bars, that's got to count for something. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Yes, but there's... 
 (KNOCKING AT DOOR) 
 That didn't sound promising. 
 The chief was asked to give his resignation. 
 He just did. 
 So what does that mean? 
 Are you fired or promoted? 
 Neither. 
 Trust me, I'm grateful, but that could all change if we don't nail this case down. 
 The city manager is gonna be running things until they can arrange for a quick election. 
 He's worried that we're going to lose control of the city before then. 
 We're not. You're damn right we're not. 
 Look, I want you to put every resource we have on this assassination and you get me an arrest before they shit-can us both. 
 All right, I'm on it. 
 Carlos. 
 Yeah? 
 What about Kiera? 
 This whole thing has Liber8 written all over it, and I don't even want to speculate about what I can only classify as the vigilante behavior that occurred last night. 
 Yeah, I'll see what I can do. 
 You okay? 
 If you're asking me if I'm adjusting to life after having a building dropped on me, then... 
 Yeah, I think I'm doing okay. 
 So look, some things have changed. 
 It's time for you to drop the superhero act and officially get back in the game. 
 No, I'm better operating outside the confines of the police department. 
 And away from the scrutiny of Agent Gardiner and CSIS? 
 Yeah, that too. 
 And by better, are you referring to the other night's escapades? 
 If it weren't for my escapades, Liber8 would've taken out the entire electrical grid. 
 That may be so, but Inspector Dillon is calling whoever pulled that stunt a vigilante. 
 Now, if the press gets wind of that story... 
 He can call it what he wants. 
 Dillon will understand. 
 Look, Dillon is under a lot of pressure right now. 
 Okay? The chief just got fired so he's going to do whatever it takes to keep his job, not to mention mine. 
 You're really both on the line for this? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 If we don't figure out who's behind the mayor's assassination and quickly, we're both out on our asses. 
 All right. 
 I'm gonna need access to the mayor's assassination files, photos, videos and to the crime scene. 
 Okay, I'll see what I can do. 
 Was the mayor in the pocket of the corporations? 
 Have you met a politician that isn't? 
 Okay, fine. 
 Then who were her enemies? 
 Well, she was pushing a lot of anti-gang legislation, so any of the organized crime outfits would be pretty happy to see her go. 
 But those are bold tactics for them. 
 So I got to say Liber8, they're trying to shake up confidence in the system and targeting public officials seems to be doing the trick. 
 Kiera, are you in or not? 
 Just to clarify, you want me to bring Liber8 to their knees, capture the mayor's killer and help you keep your job? 
 Easy! 
 He's alive. 
 Travis is alive. He's in recovery at a prison infirmary. 
 Gunshot wounds and broken ribs. 
 We need to organize a rescue. 
 The mayor was just gunned down in broad daylight, the last thing we need is to be out in the open. 
 How many cells do we have out there? 
 One less, thanks to the protector and her actions last night. 
 What are the actual numbers? 
 Half a dozen operational cells, half political, half militant. 
 Shut everything down. 
 But for how long? 
 Well, as long as it takes. 
 We wait for the dust to settle, then we get back on track. 
 After we rescue Travis! 
 I don't think you heard me... 
 Oh, am I missing something here? 
 We don't leave soldiers behind! 
 And who are you to be issuing orders? 
 Travis is still in command... 
 Travis got himself shot and captured, he can't lead from a prison. 
 So actually yes, that does make me ranking officer, do you have a problem with that, Garza? 
 Get me all the intel you can on Travis. 
 Security, anyone we have on the inside, everything. 
 Okay, so according to forensics, the kill shot came from approximately a 35-degree angle in this direction right here. 
 Now, the shooter could've been anywhere from 100 to 1,000 meters depending on their skill. 
 We've been canvassing the area, but we still don't have any leads. 
 What about these surveillance cameras? 
 Ah, they're all pointed in this direction so we have multiple angles of the mayor getting hit but almost none looking the other way. 
 Okay, you give me access to the case files and I'll get your shooter. 
 (CHUCKLES) You sound pretty optimistic. 
 Any excuse to see an old friend. 
 Experience could be a problem. 
 Well, I thought this would be a great place to get some. 
 I'm not sure that you've got what it takes. 
 I'm not sure that you're Memory Express material. 
 In here. 
 I assure you I do, I am... 
 I'm great with technical equipment, people like me mostly. 
 I'm a really hard worker with some fresh ideas, I won't let you down. 
 Well, I'll be the judge of that. 
 That's for you. 
 What can I do for you, Agent Gardiner? 
 Kiera Cameron. 
 What about her? 
 I'm looking for her. 
 That makes two of us. 
 Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know when you make contact with her, thank you. 
 And if I don't? 
 I'm sorry, don't? 
 Find her or don't make contact with me if you do? 
 Yes. 
 I don't understand. 
 I can see that. 
 Look, I'll make it simple for you. 
 You tell me why you're looking for Cameron and then maybe I'll tell you if I find her. 
 You don't wanna mess with me, Dillon. 
 Actually it's your boss and your agency I don't wanna mess with. 
 You make this personal, I will mess with you all day long. 
 You're gonna have to do better than this. 
 That doesn't look good. 
 Yeah, I'll say. 
 Betty, I need a favor. 
 Shoot. 
 I need all the available video from the mayor's assassination. 
 No problem, it's on the server already. 
 Including all of the footage from every source within a kilometer of the scene in every direction. 
 Uh... I suppose? 
 Even the ones not pointed at the mayor's assassination. 
 I'm the geek in this conversation and I don't understand what you're up to. 
 I can't really talk about it. 
 Okay. 
 I'll have it all dumped onto this for ya. 
 (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) 
 sh1t. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 There's some lady here to see you. 
 Uh, I'm busy. 
 Dude, I'm not your freakin' butler. 
 You wanna turf her, do it yourself. 
 Fine, let's get this over with. 
 Mom! 
 Alec. 
 Hey. 
 I got to run. 
 Nice to meet ya. 
 You too. 
 Um, let's go outside. 
 Sorry I never called. 
 I noticed you put all your father's equipment in storage. 
 Yeah, it's temporary. 
 Why? 
 Why is it temporary? 
 No, why all of this? 
 Leaving home so suddenly, giving up your work, living like this. 
 I can't explain that. 
 You're all I have left, you know. 
 I just... I just want my boy back. 
 Mom, I'm not a boy anymore. 
 Look, I have to do this. 
 I have to make my own way for myself, it's not for you or Roland, or anyone. 
 Look, I have my reasons. 
 Look, I better get going. 
 Of course. 
 Maybe we can have coffee sometime. 
 I'd like that. 
 Yeah, I, uh... 
 I suppose I should go. 
 Okay. 
 Bye, Mom. 
 I'm such an asshole. 
 sh1t. 
 Oh, that bitch! 
 
 
 
 Kiera? 
 I thought that might get your attention. 
 Are we really resorting to this level of behavior? 
 Look, I have work to do. 
 If you don't wanna help me, you wanna avoid me, fine. 
 I will work around you. 
 What did you upload? 
 A nasty virus. 
 Seriously? 
 No. 
 Surveillance footage I need uploaded into my CMR. 
 You wanna help? 
 You know what I'm gonna say. 
 Alec, you're overthinking the message. 
 When you get a message from your future self, telling you what my future self told me, then we can have this conversation. 
 But until then I think this situation deserves a little overthinking. 
 Okay, point taken. 
 How's the job hunt going? 
 I'm sorry, is that a touchy subject also? 
 Look, do you want my help or not? 
 Yes, please. 
 I thought so. 
 Whoa, what did you do? 
 I reconstructed the exact moment of the assassination using 360 degrees of available surveillance footage. 
 The kill shot. 
 Is this how they solve murders in 2077? 
 There are very few murders in 2077. 
 I can see why. 
 There. 
 Third from the top, muzzle flash. 
 Based on telemetry, I've got an address. 
 It's nice to have you back, Alec. 
 I'm not back, I'm just bored. 
 Yeah, right. 
 (GUN COCKING) Stay where you are, Cameron. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Same thing you are, trying to find the mayor's killer. 
 Assuming that is what you're doing here. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You're gonna answer some questions. 
 About what? 
 The City Plaza bombing. 
 About what happened afterwards. 
 I saw you, I saw... 
 I saw you survive the explosion and the fireball, and then vanish. 
 Yeah, that. 
 I'm a stranded time traveler from the year 2077, using technology that hasn't even been invented yet. 
 That's bullshit. 
 So is there anything else you'd like to talk about? 
 Yes. 
 I wanna know about the mayor, Liber8... 
 Tell me about Alec Sadler. 
 This place is a distraction. 
 Liber8 didn't kill the mayor, but there's somebody who really wants you to think they did. 
 Really? 
 Hey, Kiera. 
 I got your message. 
 Gardiner? 
 What's going on here? 
 The agent and I were just discussing some possible scenarios. 
 We're not done. 
 Well, this looks like a Liber8 nest. 
 Who stands to gain the most if Liber8 takes the heat for this? 
 Well, there's uh, political rivals, organized crime... 
 I don't know, there might even be an ex-husband out there with a beef. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 The other night, one of the Liber8 thugs had a split skull tattoo on his head. 
 What does that mean? 
 That's uh, gang ink. 
 Coalition Kings. 
 Rumor has it they've been working with Liber8. 
 Okay, then who's their rival gang? 
 Who would be the most upset to find out that the Coalition Kings were working with the big, bad Liber8? 
 You know you may be on to something. 
 Wolford has been bitching about city policies regarding his nightclub businesses. 
 Wolford? 
 Uh, Raul Wolford, he's the head of the organization. 
 We picked him up on some minor raps but somehow he always manages to beat the process. 
 Good thing I'm not part of the process. 
 Hey Martinez, it's Fonnegra. 
 I'm gonna text you an address. 
 I just wanna know if it's associated with Wolford or the West Coast Syndicate. 
 All right, thanks. 
 So what do you wanna do? 
 I probably shouldn't tell you, for your own protection. 
 Look, just give me a jump on Wolford before you issue the warrant, please. 
 Okay, there's some drawbacks to this approach. 
 Uh, legally speaking, not to mention these scumbags are dangerous. 
 Carlos, I can take care of myself and you need to keep your hands clean, you know that. 
 Method nightclub, you can start there. 
 Thank you. 
 Wait for my signal. 
 Yeah, is it gonna be a big bat projected into the night sky? 
 What? 
 Really? Never mind. 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 (INDIE MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Whoa, I got this guy. 
 Cover me, cover me! 
 (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) 
 Don't leave me hanging bro, watch my six! 
 Hold on, I got to take this. 
 Alec Sadler. 
 Hey kid, I've got some good news for you. 
 You got the job. 
 Oh, uh, thank you! 
 See you tomorrow. 
 We lost. 
 Who was that? 
 I got the computer store gig. 
 Sweet! 
 Now you can pay me the rent you owe. 
 I'm just kidding. 
 That's awesome, that's what you wanted right? 
 Yeah, yeah sure. 
 (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) 
 (DOOR OPEN ING) 
 Hello. 
 (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) 
 What do you got? Wolford and the Syndicate are linked to this apartment. 
 Then I may be looking at the rifle that took out the mayor. 
 (DOOR OPEN ING) 
 And it looks like you're gonna get to play hero after all. 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ING) 
 Wolford :  Where'd you find her? 
 Gun room, snooping around. 
 I need to search this club, your vehicle and your residence. 
 Really? 
 And then I need to take you in for the mayor's assassination. 
 This just keeps getting better and better all the time. 
 Tell me, what is it that I have to do with the mayor? 
 The shooter used your apartment. 
 My apartment? 
 No. 
 There's nothing in this city with his name on it, that's impossible. 
 What else you got? 
 You're telling the truth. 
 I always tell the truth. 
 Watch this. Take her out back and kill her. 
 No, no, no! 
 Wait, wait, wait! 
 Listen, they had to have someone on the inside! 
 Someone with access to your place! 
 You have a rival gang, what are they? 
 The Coalition? Something like that. 
 Hold up! 
 Let her finish. 
 What is this you're saying about the Coalition Kings? 
 Somebody went to an awful lot of trouble to implicate your gang in the assassination of the mayor. 
 They sent me after you. 
 They stand to gain in a number of ways. 
 Well, I wouldn't cry about it. 
 So what you're saying is we have a problem? 
 Nobody move! 
 Put your guns down! 
 Put the guns down. 
 This stinks. 
 So the ballistics on this rifle should match the round that took out the mayor, and the prints on this shell casing are... 
 Oh! They're yours, Mr. Wolford. 
 You boys are really reaching, huh? 
 I've never seen this rifle in my life. 
 That's weird, because we found it in your gun safe in your office, in your nightclub. 
 I want my lawyer. 
 See, the thing is, we called your lawyer, but, uh... 
 Apparently he's unavailable because he got picked up on some obstruction of justice charges. 
 Right, right. 
 So, uh... 
 I don't know, is there another lawyer that we can call? 
 Right. 
 Put him in a holding, we'll get you a public defender in the morning. 
 Oh, you know you're wrong! 
 You know you're wrong, right? 
 Hey, you know, you're wrong! 
 Kiera? 
 Alec. 
 I've been thinking... 
 I know. 
 No, not about that. 
 I need to see you. 
 Okay, what's going on? 
 The future. Not 2077 future, just right now future. 
 It sounds serious. 
 It is. 
 I'll come meet you, just let me take care of something first. 
 All right, thanks. 
 Agent Cameron, good work. 
 Does this mean you're back in the fold? 
 The fight that we're facing requires a little outside the box thinking. 
 I agree. 
 I'm more effective if I can avoid department restrictions and oversight. 
 Yet, maintain your support and access to your resources. 
 Nothing sticks to you or the department and I'm on my own. 
 Carlos : You know, I'm not so sure about this. 
 All right, Wolford still needs to stand trial and if his defense gets wind of Kiera's tactics, the charges may not stick. 
 Right now perception is more important than the letter of the law. 
 Wolford gets charged, we parade him in front of the press, the city sees we're in control of the situation. 
 And what if Wolford walks on a technicality? 
 Let's say he does, those bastards out there will have to think twice before they make another move. 
 Maybe it buys us some time. 
 None of this is gonna matter if what I'm thinking is right. 
 What do you mean? 
 We have to face the possibility that Wolford had nothing to do with the mayor's killing. 
 If not Wolford, then who? 
 Sonya : Candidate Martin, how is that mayoral campaign coming? 
 Just kicked into high gear, now that an election is right around the corner. 
 I guess I have you to thank for that. 
 Oh no, you can thank Garza. 
 She's the one who pulled the trigger. 
 We used gang members to plant the evidence. 
 . . I don't wanna know. 
 Deniability and such. 
 Oh, but I insist. 
 You wanted this Mr. Martin. 
 There are no half measures. 
 You are either all in, or you have no use to us or the movement. 
 You're right. 
 Great job! 
 Putting the blame on a scumbag like Wolford raises it to a whole new level. 
 Well, two for one in my books. 
 We will be counting on your support, Mr. Mayor. 
 You will have it. 
 Are we, uh... 
 Are we good? 
 You tell me. 
 You look like you could use some protection. 
 You just get here? 
 I did. 
 I spent the last couple of weeks in a prison hospital recovering. 
 Recovering from what? 
 Sonya. 
 These two inmates should not be in the same facility, let alone be allowed to mingle. 
 It's a violation of standard procedure. 
 Well, my office needs intel and we're not gonna let procedure interfere with that. 
 Alec, you don't know if his message was manipulation or genuine. 
 Well, from what you know about me in the future, what would you guess? 
 I'd say it's a 50-50 proposition. 
 Look, future you didn't get where he did by playing nice and being transparent about his intentions. 
 He's a powerful man and he protects that power. 
 This whole thing is making me crazy. 
 I mean, I want to help you, I know you're trying to do the right thing. 
 I just don't know whether or not I'm working against the message. 
 What about me? 
 You? 
 Yes, me. 
 Why am I here? 
 Why did you send me back? 
 I don't know. 
 You think you're the only one with questions? 
 What are you doing? 
 Take it. 
 Maybe you can figure out how it works, reverse engineer it into something useful and send me back where I belong. 
 That might take some time. 
 Time is all I seem to have right now. 
 The future you didn't say anything about not helping me, did he? 
 Look, I got to work in the morning so I should split. 
 We good? 
 Sure. 
 I got your back. 
 Thanks, Alec. 
 See ya. 
 What are you up to, old man? 
 I speak to you, not as who you'll become, but as an old man who knows you best. 
 You and I were given a gift from our father. 
 He died young, but he imparted in us a passion for technology and innovation. 
 What you need to know, what I tried to do... 
 Listen to me carefully, Alec. 
 I have gone down a dangerous path and I have taken the world with me. 
 Only you can prevent this future from happening. 
 No!
