 Narrator : Previously on Continuum... 
 Who has been in charge in my absence? 
 I have. 
 Yo, step-bro. 
 All right, then. 
 Are you lost? 
 My family used to live there. 
 Well, we live here now. 
 I'm a guy with a bad future ready for a fresh start. 
 We're getting information Liber8 has three possible bombing targets. 
 What type of device? 
 Unknown. The electronic signature's cloaked. 
 We'll be using eyes and ears. 
 Check your weapons and lock down your gear. 
 It's going to be one hell of a ride. 
 Greg :  Kiera? 
 Greg, are you still with Mr. Sadler? 
 He's just about to speak. Why? 
 CPS just got word that Liber8 is going to hit a high value target. 
 I am worried SadTech could be it. 
 There's no way they could get in here. (STATIC) Greg? (ALARMS BLARING) CPS just declared martial law. Liber8 terrorists got inside the safe zone. Hit a SadTech warehouse. Greg? Oh, God. Greg, please! Hang On, people! Hang on! (EXPLOSIONS ECHOING) Sonya : Travis has them assembled. Thank you, Sonya. Your loyalty to Travis is inspiring to me. Thank you. You could be forgiven otherwise. My loyalty to Travis is second only to mine for you and our cause. I'll be in shortly. What are your orders, Edouard? Due to the Protector's presence here, it seems our plan needs altering. By about 60 years. Our goals are still the same. The Corporate Congress may not yet exist, but its seeds have been planted. We will ensure it never grows. We will do this by inspiring a new generation to take up our cause and undermine the very foundations that the Congress will be built on. We will not do this through open confrontation. We are still at war... A war we will never win unless we fight it on the enemy's terms. We don't need guns to transform the world. We have the knowledge of what will happen and the power to imagine better. You're a good soldier. In my absence, you did what you thought was best. You kept our people together and most of them alive. But now, from this point forward, instead of force to win our battles, we use strategy and knowledge. How do we begin? By securing our position. Attack the Protector? Attack her we will. But not the way she will expect it. TRAVIS; Lily Jones? (SCREAMS) (PHONE RINGING) Is the Protector in sight? Tell me you got the girl. Travis : Yes. Good. Hurry. (SCREAMS) (CRACKS) It's done. I'm on the move. No change. (TIRES SCREECHING) Kiera : 2077. My time, my city, my family. When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. They had other plans. (EXPLOSION) A time-travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on was me. Hey, good morning. Morning, Carlos. Did you do something different to your hair? Nope. Huh. Something's different about you. It's the same as yesterday. Actually, Carlos is right. Don't you start. Excuse me? (MOUTHING) Alec, explain yourself. Ah, jeez. (GRUNTS) Um, I can't talk. I've got a malfunction, a serious malfunction... Alec. What I mean is, ever since your suit went on the fritz you've been acting, I don't know... Different. I have? Turning off your HUD. Trusting your gut. It's very un-future cop. Maybe I'll meet up with Carlos and we can compare notes. Even one phone call and you're a dead man. Understood. No contacting Carlos. (COMPUTER BEEPING) I can see that. Lily Jones. Age 20. That's too young to die. Look at the estimated time of death. Uh, yeah, 9:30. Why, what's up? What's the significance? Garza was shadowing me at that time. Garza was shadowing you and this is the first that I'm hearing of it? You want to take a ride? (CHUCKLES) Okay, you know what? You are right. Nothing has changed. I'm complicated. You think? Good morning. Hi. Hey, thanks for holding the body for us. What have we got? Her C2 is subluxated from C3. Someone very powerful did this. You should take a look at the bruising around her mouth and chin. How powerful? Mmm... Speculating, she was grabbed by the throat like so, lifted off her feet, straight up, one hand, then dumped here. Credit cards and money still in her wallet. So it's not a robbery. Unless somebody interrupted them. No track marks if that's what you're looking for. We got any witnesses? Yeah. Canvas turned up a homeless guy who may or may not have seen a large man exit the alley. Or Big Foot. (CHUCKLES) What about this camera up here? Anything from there? Mmm-mmm. Owner says it's just a prop, there to scare off the bad guys. Carlos : That seemed to have work well. Clayton : Uh-huh. All right, see if we could round up any of the feeds from cameras that have coverage of this area. Okay, yeah. You know, that kind of brute strength matches the description of Travis. I'm assuming that's why we're here, because you have some sort of a lead that connects this to our gang? Lily Jones was the name of a witness in a case that Section 6 was building against Liber8. The case fell apart. She recanted and when pressed to testify, she ran. She just disappeared? Yeah. Her identity was kept a secret and her files were sealed. So you are actually checking for identifying marks over there. My Lily has a butterfly tattoo on the inside of one of her wrists. Wait, hold on, your Lily? You actually know her? No. Of her. We never met. Okay, so this is either a robbery gone wrong, or this is just the tip of the iceberg. I should call my people, get an assessment. Okay, I'll have units re-canvas the area and see what we can come up with as far as footage from the cameras. Thanks. Was that true what you said about Lily Jones? I mean I know it wasn't, but you had me convinced What's going on? Lily Jones is my grandmother's name. They're targeting my family. (DOORBELL BUZZES) Travis, someone's at the door. I'm back. Get in here. How'd you find us, Kellog? I have an appointment. I like the new digs. I can't believe he's still alive. Seems reports of my death were exaggerated. That's Twain. Great writer. He's got this one about a Connecticut Yankee, and... Anyway, I bear gifts. I figured you haven't had time to discover all the wonders of this generation. All kinds of fruit, juicy, succulent. You guys got to try these oranges. They're amazing. What are you doing here, Kellog? Oh, just coming by to say, no hard feelings about, you know, leaving me to die with a bomb strapped to my jewels, Travis. Is this true? He's a deserter. Regardless. We don't ever take arms against one of our own. Even I understand you've chosen your own path. Travis, continue on the endeavor we have begun. That will allow Matthew and I time to speak. Did you steal this? Nothing so crass. With just a little memory recall, I was able to turn a small fortune in the market. I don't want anything to do with your money, Matthew. Of course not. But in terms of funding a full revolution, it's a pretty good start, don't you think? (CHUCKLES) So, now that we're back on the right foot, where do we start? We? While you were satisfying your appetites, I have been considering a more critical problem. This girl may not have been my grandmother, but if the gang is looking for Lily Joneses, it's only a matter of time before they find the right one. What, you don't know your own grandmother? Look, you know everything about me, and I hardly know anything about you. Do you think it's fair? She died in her 50's. I was only four. So do you think it's a coincidence, or are they really targeting you through your family? I wish I knew but... I got to go. Hey, so Betty is tracking down all of the Lily Joneses in the area. (MOBILE BEEPS) Should have word back soon. Ready to go? I'm gonna have to catch up. Have you found a solution? Yes, this is a DNA testing kit we can use to be definite about the results. Lucas will modify it to be instantaneous. But we still need an original tissue sample for a baseline. I'll get it. No. Sonya will go. Take Garza, get what you need. (SIGHS) What, no hello? The last time I met you here you were carrying a live grenade. Then, we almost got blown up by a mine. So forgive me for not being polite. I'm exciting to be around, what can I say? So this is a Kevlar optional affair? For you. Not for your ancestors I just met with Kagame. The danger is real. They're going after your grandmother. I already know that. Why? Well, to get rid of you for starters. And it's all your fault. You had to threaten Lucas with killing his grandparents. That got them all going about what might happen if one of our ancestors were killed. And now Kagame, he wants to try a grand experiment to test our paradoxical vulnerability. Cupcake? So that makes me what? The guinea pig? Squeak, squeak. How'd they even know my grandmother's name? Kagame, he has his ways. But why would he have that information about my family? Hell if I know. Look, I don't know all the details about how our escape was arranged, but I do know that the guards were in on it. Who knows how high the conspiracy went? Maybe whoever arranged it told him. So you're telling me that I might be here for a reason? Part of some bigger plan? Given what's happened, does anything seem too far-fetched to you? What? If you think I have ulterior motives, join me on my yacht tonight. How about lunch? Deal. Thanks for the lunch. You can pick up the check. Carlos. Yeah, look, I spoke with my contact at Section 6. They confirmed that the gang is going after our witness and that she's in town. So they killed the wrong girl. And they're just gonna keep going until they get the right one. Okay, then we need to round up all the Lily Joneses in the lower mainland, put them in protective custody. Here you go, sir. Can we get it done? Well, we don't have a choice. Thanks. (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN) Hey! Hey! (PANTING) Sorry, I'm late. Where's... What the hell happened to you? Bike messenger. I stepped out on the street, and I didn't even see him. You kidding me? Are you okay? Yeah. What do you got? Uh... Well, I had Samantha look up all the Lily Joneses in our age range. There's eight of them, nine if you count our dead girl. We've got their addresses. I've sent units to their homes, but it is daytime so they could be at work or school. But at least we've got some leads. We can cover more ground if we split up. That's a good idea. Okay, I'll requisition you a cruiser. Thanks. They're like drones, blissfully unaware they're being trained into subservience. Well, those that seek the truth will find it. This has been programmed for the Protector's DNA. You can use it to match with the girls'. You think she's going to just sit there while I perform your test? Then kill her first. That's not what Kagame wants. Why are you so sure one of the Lilys is here? I just know. You've searched her before, haven't you? You've googled your grandmother. I knew that she lived here for a little while. Sol looked up the names and some of the data. This woman, she's exactly like my mom said her mother was. She's smart, she's intelligent, she's involved in the community. You've been stalking her. Maybe. What are you going to do? You just gonna walk up to her and say, "Hello, I'm your future granddaughter"? Wait, there she is. Um, I got to go! There you are. Here I am. And then I guess he got a little upset about that... Kiera : Lillian Jones? I'm Detective Kiera Cameron. May I have a word? Uh... Yeah, I'll see ya later. Miss Jones, your life is in danger. Dad's waiting for us to start. Let's go. Uh, yeah, about that, um... I'm gonna have to take a pass on the meeting today. I'm in the middle of something really big. What, and you think Dad isn't? Honestly? What Roland does kind of gives me the creeps. So, if you'll excuse me I have more important things to do than sit around with a bunch of conspiracy freaks wearing tin foil hats. Whoa! Whoa, hold on. Wait! You're always going on about how important whatever you do is. Like you're saving the frickin' world or something. How 'bout spending a little more time with your family, huh? You're not my family. This whole grass roots activism of yours isn't changing the world. It's a joke. You want to change the world, you got to leave the living room first. We may not be a real family, Alec, but we're the closest thing you've got. And you're saying terrorists are killing women with my name and you can't give me specifics? No. I think I might lose it. Please try and stay calm. What do I do? Well, if you come with me, I'll take you into custody, get you somewhere safe. Okay. Kiera : Here. (PHONE RINGING) Excuse me, I've got to take this. Cameron. Hey, I just got word that a Lily Jones was involved in an incident. An incident? Yeah, an assault of some sort. Details are pretty sketchy. Where? Broadway and Granville. They've got the assailant, too. Tell them to use extreme caution. Way ahead of you. Look, I'm leaving the precinct now. You go and get Lily, I'll deal with the assailant. 
 
 You're at one of the best universities in the country. Your parents must be very proud. Yeah, they are. (CHUCKLES) They wouldn't be named Jim and Alison by any chance, would they? No. Kevin and Eve. Miss Jones. I'm gonna need you to come with me. Is this a joke? Uh, this is the victim. That's Lily Jones. Let's go! Get me the hell out of here! sh1t! Let's go! You may want to get a tetanus shot. Thanks. Are you done eyeing me up? Are your parents' names Jim and Alison? Did they send you to come get me? 'Cause I'm not going. And you can't make me. I'm emancipated. And that girl owed me money. I was just trying to collect. I don't owe you anything, you delinquent. Hey! You can't arrest me for a misunderstanding. I'm not arresting you. Then let me go. No, you need to come with me because your life is in danger. Oh. I get it. Are you here to help? Clean up the street kids? Don't bother. I've never done anything more than smoke a joint. This just keeps getting better. Who's the chick? There's a terrorist group killing women named Lily Jones. You're Lily Jones. She's Lily Jones. I'm taking you both to the station for your own protection. I thought you said you weren't going to arrest me! I'm not. Relax! I guess we're in a unique club. I mean, it's not every day you get chased by a terrorist. It's very Terminator. Shut up. I like your necklace. Is it a butterfly? I'm actually always looking for little stuff like that. Blah, blah, blah... Hey. Okay, I'm just trying to make the best out of a bad situation. You wouldn't know a bad situation if it bit you on your Dolce & Gabbanas. I'd rather take my chances against terrorists than sit here listening to her. Just let me out anywhere. Not until you're both safe. How do we know you aren't the danger? That badge could be fake. You could just be some psycho kidnapping us. Right. (TIRES SCREECHING) Let go! Let me go! Lily : Ow! Just take me, bitch. One Lily Jones is dead already. I am trying to prevent that from happening again. Are we clear? Everything is going to be fine. Okay? I promise. Oh, God. Um... Unroll the window. I am not letting you out of this car until we get to the Precinct. I'm gonna puke. Whoa! No, no, no, no! Not in my purse! Roll down the window. Okay, okay, okay. (RETCHING) (SIGHS) That's much better. Do you have a weird taste in your mouth? Kind of like you've been sucking on a nail? Yeah. How'd you know? I had that when I was pregnant. I'm only a couple of days late. Okay. But we still need to (ALARMS WAILING) Oh. Are you guys Okay? (LILY COUGHS) Are you okay? We got to get out of the car. We got to get out of the car. Stay down. (GUNFIRE) Come here. Okay, pull her out, pull her out. Let's go. Stay down. Down, down, down. Stay down, stay down, stay low! Down, down, down, stay down, stay down. (GUNFIRE) (GRUNTS) Go that way, behind that car. Where's my back up, Alec? Carlos is on route. Just hang tight. (GUNFIRE) Kiera, can you hear me? Kiera : Stay down, get down, get down. Kiera, are you okay? (SIRENS WAILING) You Okay? Yeah. Are you okay? Are you sure we're safe? Carlos took other Lily to the station. We're going somewhere safer. I think you missed a few brands back there. Have friends much? What do you mean by that? You're all like, "Do this, do that, get in the car, "someone's trying to kill you." You're kind of bossy. Look who's talking. Yeah. I'm a kid. I'm supposed to be like that. You're the adult. You're supposed to be nice. Get in the car. Please. (PHONE DIALING) (PHONE RINGING) Why aren't you using your CMR? Because I have company. I need you to track down some people for me. (PHONE RINGING) You're a mind reader. Kellog, I need you to be on call. Just say the word. I can have her gassed up and ready to go in an hour. I got to pee. Thank you. I just figured they would be looking for us everywhere, airports, bus terminals, train stations... Us? My relative and I. You found her? Okay. Listen, for this I'll expect nothing in return. We can save that romantic harbor cruise for another... (DISCONNECTS) (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Matthew? I understand you've been a busy little bee. Flitting about, pollinating. And straying into things you shouldn't. Now, someone has to pay the price. Mister Kellog, what's going on? Why did these people take me? Maddie, Maddie... Are we clear? What's this all about? (DISCONNECTS) (PHONE RINGING) Lily, how, uh... How's it going in there? Lily : I've got six more seconds. (PHONE RINGING) False positives happen all the time, right? How are you feeling? Scared. That's understandable. Are you kidding me? This is a frickin' nightmare. I'm not old enough to have a kid! I'm 17! What are you looking at? Nothing. Sorry. This is horrible. My life is ruined. Lily...--' (SIGHS) It's a boy. I'm gonna call the clinic. I think it's 1,400 life credits or something. Is that what you want? I just thought that with everything... I was (SIGHS) going to give this to you on your birthday next week, but considering the circumstances... (GASPS) Will you marry me? Yes. Yes. Yes. (PHONE RINGING) Lily, having a baby doesn't mean giving up on your dreams. A child can add to them. You don't get it. I don't have dreams. I don't have a job. I don't have a regular place to crash. I didn't even finish high school. I'm just... I'm going to get rid of it. Before you go there, Lily, think about this. Talk to the father. Jake? (PHONE RINGING) Yeah, that's a great idea. As soon as I tell Jake, he's gonna ditch my ass. Lily... For all you know, he'll love this baby. Most people go through their lives thinking they know exactly what the future holds for them. They've got a fantasy about what the world is. But sometimes, you're going through your day and bang! There's an explosion and everything you know is gone. And it makes you wish you'd done things differently... (PHONE RINGING) You going to get that? What? They took her. Took who? Maddie. My grandmother. They found out that I tipped you. And now they're going to use me to get to you. Get to me how? They want a trade. Maddie for Lily. Are you sure the girls are safe here? We read how the precinct was attacked. Betty, Betty... How do we know... Because our security systems have been upgraded, we're equipped for anything. I still haven't heard a sufficient plan on how you... Please, please, just talk to Betty, okay? She'll take care of everything. (PHONE RINGING) What are you doing? Where are you going? I got to take this. Good luck. (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Okay, hey! This is how it's going to be. Whoa! Hey, where are you? I've got a precinct full of Lilys and their parents... It's like herding cats. I'm, uh, with my Lily. Okay, well, Dillon's breathing down my neck. He wants to know what Section 6 wants done with these girls. I don't have any news. (SIGHS) That's uh... That's great. But I do have someone else I need you to track down. Please tell me it's not another Lily. Not exactly. I'll text you the name. (DISCONNECTS) Is everything okay? I still haven't changed my mind. When I found out I was pregnant I didn't think I was ready, either. I was fresh out of the military and starting a new career. Having a child was the last thing on my mind. What happened? I told my boyfriend. You're still together? Married. So are you going to tell me why I've been rammed into and chased and shot at? That's complicated. I'm not going to do this. I'm by myself. I don't even have family. You don't have to. This little girl is the opportunity for you to start a family of your own. And one day, she will grow up and she will have a daughter of her own. And you will find yourself surrounded by so much love, you'll wonder how you ever got so lucky. How do you know I'm going to have a girl? Oh, just a hunch Lily, I'm going to ask you to do something dangerous. I need you to trust me. Yes. Yes, okay. Uh... He's ready. Say what you will about Kellog, he's very resourceful. You know, I'd get suspended for pulling a stupid stunt like this. I'll take the heat if anything goes sideways. Damn straight you will. Promise me you'll think about telling Jake. He may surprise you. That's if we make it out of here alive. We Will. We have to. We're good? We're good. Is that her? Send Maddie over. First you send over the girl. Change of plans. That's not her grandmother. No... That's my mother. Is she pregnant? Yes, with me. Garza, give him what he wants. Let's go. Go ahead, they won't hurt you. You okay? Okay... Hey! I'm not good with this, but I'm good enough. Bye-bye. Lily : So that's it? I'm free? We've I've still got to get you... Wait a minute. (GUNFIRE) Get down, get down. No, no! No! (GUNFIRE) Call 911. (GUNFIRE) It's going to be okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. Hey, hey. Stay with me, stay with me. It's going to be okay. There's an ambulance on its way. (MADDIE SOBBING) Ambulance is coming, okay? Just stay... Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die! Don't die. Listen, stay with me, stay with me! (GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION) Stay awake! Hey... You're still alive. You think I care about that? The ambulance is on its way... (SNIFFLING) (WEEPING) Come here. It's okay. Kiera! Sam! Dad! Hey, buddy. Where have you been? Sadler changed the location of our meeting at the last minute. He wouldn't let me tell you for security reasons. We left SadTech 20 minutes before the blast. I tried to call but communications were down... Don't you ever disappear like that again. If I ever lost you... (SOBBING) Jake can do his graphic design anywhere, so as long as this new place has Internet access... You take care of her. Bye. Thank you, Kellog. I appreciate this. See you soon. You know, Kellog is going to cash in this favor. Kiera : I can handle Kellog. The bullet that killed Maddie,  according to Kagame's experiment, it should have killed Kellog as well. Why didn't it? That's precisely the problem. If Kellog had died or disappeared when Maddie was killed, then we would have definitive proof that this timeline is connected to the one you left. So, what does this prove? (SIGHS) Unfortunately nothing. Maybe Maddie wasn't Kellog's biological grandmother. Maybe you are on a new timeline, or maybe you aren't and there is no paradox. I don't know. The absence of proof isn't proof of anything. Well, hopefully Kagame now believes they can't get to me through my family. That's one less thing to worry about. I gave my word. My word. You behave like a mad dog and I will put you down. Mom. I found the necklace. It was underneath your bed. Thank you, sweetheart. It's really old, isn't it? Yeah. My grandmother gave it to me when I was a little girl.
