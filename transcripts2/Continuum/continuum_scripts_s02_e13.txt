 Narrator :  Previously on  Continuum... 
 You call them Freelancers. 
 They have tattoos. 
 It's a series of dots between their fingers. It's the DNA results from that test that I did on Jason. He's my father. Ms. Cathers was working on a high security project for SadTech. This case is being bumped upstairs. But, sir... Officer Cameron, dismissed. This feels great! This is what you want? (SCREAMING) No! Emily! Whatever this is, it got that SadTech engineer killed. And it has something to do with the Liber8 executions. My supervisor purged the record. Like it didn't even happen. But you're not gonna leave it at that, are you? Someone was murdered for this information. And it's my case. Even if CPS wants to bury it. She uncovered a possible Liber8 escape plot involving an explosive device. And a connection to a murdered SadTech engineer. I'll have to look into this. Of course. But please, let me know if anything comes of it. Is there something else? My wife is supposed to work the execution. I don't want to bother Mr. Sadler, unless there's a verifiable threat. I know exactly what you mean. I'll keep her away from the action. Make sure nothing happens to her. Thank you. His wife is the officer who investigated the murder of our friend. What if she digs deeper? There's something to be said for a cop with determination, integrity, and a... Desire to uncover the truth. We don't see much of that these days. We're in a delicate position. Leave it with me. I'll see that steps are taken. Yes, sir. No! Kiera? Are you okay? My head is killing me. Okay, um, let me get you something. I've got some meds from our travel kit. It feels like something went wrong with my CMR. Your CMR? Today is the day. The end of Liber8 injustice. Finally. Ah, it feels... What's this? Work thing. You all right? Yeah, it's funny. It's like a memory that's almost there and then it's gone. That ever happen to you? All the time. You know what? I was thinking we could meet after work? Go to the prison together? Sounds great. Kiera. See you after work, sweetheart. Meet you on the train. Have a good day. Very funny, mister. You can have him when you're done. Soy milk, again? The Liber8 terrorists don't know that we've uncovered their plot. They'll find out too late and the execution will unfold as it must. Why let the charade go so far? Because so long as they think they have a chance of escape, we can ferret out their co-conspirators on the outside! Their false hope gives us a powerful means of control. Control I mean to preserve at all costs. That's all for now. You have an explanation? I had no choice. Ramona Cathers was approached by someone with inside knowledge. She was going to expose us. Approached by whom? A sect of some kind. Believers. They are aware of your research and claim a dogmatic responsibility to intervene. The Freelancers. Excuse me? Stay on this. Report directly to me. We need to take this Freelancer threat seriously. That's precisely why I invited you here today. You're the only one I can trust with this. I won't let you down. Kiera :  2077. My time, my city, my family. When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. They had other plans. A time travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on was me. Well, this is unexpected but a pleasure. Hope this has something to do with our previous conversation. You sat right next to Emily and pretended not to know her. I sent her to protect you, Alec. Protect me and steal from me! When Emily developed feelings for you, I worried at first that she would compromise herself. But an agent devoted to the subject, Alec, is an agent devoted to the cause. Well, I'm glad it was convenient for you, because she's dead, you asshole! You know, if you'd never done this, she'd still be alive. But you gave her that job, to protect me! And now... Alec, I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. That wasn't my intent. You know, I don't even know why I came here. Except for to make you realize that I hold you responsible. If you want me to bear responsibility, I will. Now tell me what happened, help me to understand. The woman is Maya Hartwell. 22, no fixed address. You ID the suits? Yeah, we think they're affiliated with the same group that stole the Liber8 corpses from the morgue. So possibly connected to Gardiner's death. Oh, I'd say it's a good bet. You're trying to exonerate Cameron, I see that. But you were supposed to bring her in. Now, CSIS thinks that you're involved and that's put me in a bad position. I need her in here and I need her to answer these questions, if you want to move past this. She's being pursued and she's gone to ground. You'd do the same thing. I wish I shared your belief in her. Just call off the APB. Get CSIS off her tail. Just like that? All is forgiven? You want her to come in? She has to feel like she has a safe landing. Let her know that she still has friends here. I'll do my best. (PHONE VIBRATES) Fonnegra. Carlos, are you okay? Yeah, I didn't fall off a roof. You? What happened to Emily? I need you to tag Fonnegra's call, now. Now! Carlos? She's dead. Kiera, you tried your best. That's debatable. You need to come in. I can protect you here. Yeah, I... I have to talk to Alec first. GPS puts her at Cordova and Cambie. No specific address. Hey, get me Ed Lam in internal affairs, please. Here he is. Hey, guys! I would've happily come to visit if you'd simply invited me. I got a text message from my source inside the police department. Why are Kiera Cameron, Alec Sadler and Escher meeting at Piron right now as we speak? What're they up to, Matthew? Answer the question or I'm gonna blow your hand off. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now, let's not make any snap decisions. We had a deal. Travis : Your money comes with too many strings. We're not puppets. You're fools if you don't listen to what I have to say. New information. Changes everything. Blow his hand off. No! Listen to me! I predicted Escher was gonna be a problem! Yeah, for you. For me! Tell that to Garza! What about Garza? Whoever snatched her is connected to Escher. Which makes him a problem for all of us. A terminal one. Could you give us a moment please, Marco? Thanks, Marco. The kid made the time travel device whole again. Escher's got an anti-matter power source. Devoted an entire floor of Piron to set it up. Put the two together, you guys could actually get back to the time frame you wanted. Change the course of the revolution when it counts most! Naturally, I'll hang back here, do my part to lay the groundwork. Whoa, whoa! You're testing my patience. When that thing works again, a guy like Escher is gonna use it. What if he goes back? And? He goes back in time to before we get here, lies in wait, and then kills us all upon arrival. (KELLOG COUGHS) One of dozens of possible scenarios that all play out the same way. No more revolution, no more competition. Everything just the way it was. But we're all dead. Well, I'm guessing you've got some ideas. Hey... This is me. So Emily was with Kiera when she was shot? She was until Kiera went after the device. Leaving an unarmed Emily to fend for herself. Don't try to put this on Kiera. You still have a part to play in all this. I know I do, that's why we're talking. Alec, I have always had an abiding interest in you. And when Liber8 and Kiera arrived in this time, I could no longer stand in the shadows. I want to help you. I want you back in my life. Back in your life? What is that supposed to mean? It means that we're family. Excuse me? I'm your father, Alec. I know who my father is, it's not you. If someone else is claiming to be your father... He doesn't have to. He's a DNA match! DNA? Jason. You think Jason's your father? I know he is! The fire had to be authentic. For me to protect you. It was the only thing that I kept. No, keep it. Keep it! I know it's a lot to process. With everything I've learned... The work you've left behind... What I've done, what you've done. It's like we've been working together this whole time. I was hoping you'd see it that way. There's something that I want to show you. It's directly below us. Something that I think will bring us closer together. Kiera : Alec? What're you doing here? I heard about Emily. I'm so sorry. You should have been by her side. That's what you were supposed to do. If you had, she'd still be alive! I made a decision that I thought was the right one. Yeah, for you. It's my only chance to see my son. I reacted... Your selfishness killed her! Alec, I know this hurts. But Escher is the one that put Emily in harm's way. He put her there to protect me. He's manipulating you. (GUN COCKS) Hands where I can see them, Cameron! Alec, I never meant to hurt you. In any way, I'm sorry. (HANDCUFFS CLOSE) Alec, I know what you must think of me. And I probably deserve it. But that man cannot be trusted. He's family. What do you know about that? Get her out of here. Alec. Alec, please. I will always blame you. Do you understand me? Always. (SIREN WAILING) Kiera? Look, I know you can't talk but... You were right about everything. Emily, Escher... He's up to something. He told me he installed an anti-matter machine here at Piron. If you can somehow get out of this jam  and get the time travel device, I'll be able to send you home, and this whole nightmare will be over. Thanks, Alec. (INDISTINCT TALKING) You tracked my phone call to Kiera. I had my orders. Thought you lost a taste for that. You're just lucky you weren't with her, or you would have been arrested, too. Yeah, well, I have a feeling that's not far off. I don't know what's happening here anymore. You know, Betty. You just haven't decided what you're gonna do about it yet. I need you to requisition some evidence from lock-up. Can you do that for me? That's not what I usually do. Yeah, does anything around here lately match that description? Are you gonna do this for me, or am I gonna tell Dillon that you're the Liber8 mole? I talked to a contact at IA. He traced your calls and texts. You did the rest. What happens now? That depends. Dillon : Carlos says I've got it wrong. He thinks that you've been set up for Gardiner's murder. Says there's something unusual about the evidence. It's all just a little too neat. It's funny. Of all the people that I've met since I arrived here, I would have picked you as one who knew me. Trusted me, even. I would have picked me to be that guy, too. But things change. Not things... You. You lost what you had when Nora showed up, and you wanted to get it back no matter what the cost. You didn't care who got hurt in the process. We have enough to charge you for Gardiner's murder. And it doesn't really matter whether I trust you or not. CSIS is gonna come in here. They're gonna take over this investigation, and they are going to corroborate the ties to you and Liber8. Let me guess. Escher is providing them with the evidence? Kiera. You know you could buy yourself some goodwill here. Just tell me what you know. I'll go to bat for you. The way you used to go to bat for all of us? There's no need for you in here, Detective. I'm okay, Carlos. 
 
 What the hell is that? I'm sorry. For what? For this. You shouldn't have done that. Yeah, there's an epidemic of that going around lately. Carlos, don't! You're throwing away your career. I know how much it means to you. The career I want isn't here anymore. You need to get home. You better go. Ever since I got here, you were the one person who never failed me. Look, save the speech for when you get home. That is what you're doing, right? I don't think I'll be around in 2077 but... Look me up, will you? See how I get out of this mess. I will. Thank you. Goodbye, Carlos. Carlos! Don't throw away your whole life. Just come back inside, please. I know we can figure this out together. It's way too late for that. I'm a cop, Betty. I still want that to mean something. Why don't you come with me? Where would we go? I don't know... We'll figure something out. Hey, who's there? Jason! Are you okay? Yeah. I think so. You come here to hide as well? To hide? Yeah, from the Freelancers? Yes, I think it's safe here. Yeah? Oh, good. Kellog : Looking for something? Where's the device, Kellog? Safe. It's not gonna work without this. I wasn't planning on going anywhere. Well, I'm not in the mood for games. What do you want? I've been thinking about it. Sometimes you get so deep into the game, that you lose sight of the goal. Of the win. I don't have a lot of time. That could be true. She's nowhere. Surveillance cameras? Nothing. Like she wasn't even here. But I found Fonnegra. So to speak. I need everyone's attention. As of this moment, Kiera Cameron is public enemy number one. She should be considered armed, and extremely dangerous. If you encounter Agent Cameron, take all necessary precautions. Add Carlos Fonnegra as number two. He's done. Give me the device, Matthew. Matthew? That might be endearing if it wasn't so damn manipulative. This is no manipulation. This is a straight up threat. You give me the device, or I kill you. It's as simple as that. The device isn't here. And killing me won't solve your bigger problem. But it would make me feel so much better. What bigger problem? Escher. Travis... Who knows what else. What are they called? Freelancers? You wanna get home. You'll need to save the kid. Your investment at risk? Alec is in danger. Kiera, he's right. Alec needs you... Alec doesn't know how dangerous Escher is. I bring you Alec, you bring me the rest of the device. And feel free to take out Escher as your gratuity. When I was your age, younger, I believed in the value of technology. People believe that they are free, but the reality is they've never been more enslaved. So you intend to re-write history using these convicts? Liber8 wouldn't exist if it weren't for me. Perhaps they're nothing more than a manifestation of my conscience. What if you're wrong? What if they go back and nothing changes? Plan fails? I have to try. To do otherwise... I couldn't live with that. Or die with it. Ensure that the power generator in the room below triggers the device. Send them back. Why me? Because you'll inherit my failure if I don't succeed. And I wouldn't wish that on anyone. You can count on me, Father. This technology isn't supposed to be possible! No, it isn't. It's a launch pad, Alec. To the past, to the future. To our future, Alec. But we need the device to make it work. Kiera will never give it up. Sadler :  She doesn't trust you. What if you gave her a second chance? She feels guilty about what happened, convince her that you want to send her home. I'm not that good of a liar. Escher :  it's simple if you cloak it in the truth, Alec. Okay, what am I telling her? That you've hacked the security protocols. Gained access to the lab on the 34th floor. 34th floor, good to know. Hello, Kellog! Nice place you got here. I'm just here to check up on our little arrangement. She's on her way. You're one of them! I used to be. The Freelancers recruited me, when I was your age. So Mom knew about everything? No. She thought I'd been murdered. That's why she never said anything to anyone. She was afraid. And the fire? I wanted out. It wasn't an option. I could handle the Freelancers coming after me, but not the two of you. The death of Marc Sadler made you both safe. Or it did until Kiera showed up. Kiera? What is that supposed to mean? Kiera changed everything. He's expecting you. I know. Thanks for getting me the suit, Protector. Makes me feel whole again. (GROANS) Playing field's even, now. You really think you can beat me? (GROANS) (GROANS) Didn't have to end like this, Cameron. You could have joined our fight. (YELLS) When are you gonna wake up? You're the villain in this tale. (GROANING) Where are you going? We both know this fight won't go the distance. I'm going to get Alec, get Kiera's piece of the time travel device, before the police clean up the place. No, you stay here. Our deal was I give you Kiera and Escher, in return for Alec being left alone. I am a man of my word. Don't touch that! I'm gonna make Sadler pay for this! For this pathetic life. But first... I'll start with you! Too bad, Cameron. (GROANS) (GRUNTS) You should have stayed home, Protector. (GROANS) (SCREAMS) (COCKS) (GROANS) I don't know who you people are. But this isn't business anymore. This is personal. (GUNSHOT) Hi. Perhaps you can help me. Any idea where the anti-matter lab is? I'm very glad you're a man of your word. Oh, Matthew. What is it? Things have spun out of control in this time. Trouble is waiting for me at every corner. And I fear it's only gonna get worse. Are you reneging on our deal? Quite the opposite. I'm coming with you. What happened to you? Travis happened. But he's dead now. Where's Escher? I bought us some time. This could have been me. Hey, a guy can dream. What is he doing here? I'll explain later. Are you sure you can do this? Let's find out. Kiera : How much time do we have before Escher figures out what we're up to? Sadler : Not long. Okay, I'm gonna send you back, just prior to the moment you left. Why? Because if you don't stop Liber8 from traveling back the first time, then your future remains uncertain. But if you send me back from before the time that I came then there could... There could be two of you? Yeah, possibly. I don't know, maybe the time continuum won't allow for it and one of you will be erased. Maybe by sending you back I can stop you from coming in the first place and this you ceases to exist. I don't know, it's complicated. It's a leap of faith. It is. (CLATTERING) The couplings are secure. Building up a charge now. Time coordinates are set. Your temporal matrix seems stable. This is it. Alec, I just wanna say... Don't bother, Kiera. No, I do. He really means don't bother. Nice to see you, Matthew. I'm sorry, Kiera. Alec? It was the only way to get the device back. Kiera : Alec. What are you doing? I'm protecting my family. And our legacy. I don't understand. Myself, Alec, Jason. Time travel is just not some technological marvel, Kiera. It's the family business. Who are you? A friend. I'm here to prevent you from making a mistake. You have no idea what I'm doing here, friend. In specific terms, no. But I swore an oath to protect the world from those who would abuse technology to pervert and exploit the past, the present and the future. Alec, he is not family. He is a threat. You don't get it, Kiera. He's my father! What's she doing here? It was just fine until you showed up. There was no one after him, there was no gun to his head. I protected him! You exploited him. And you exposed him. And now I know my son is not safe, unless he's by my side. Man :  Sentenced to death... (INAUDIBLE) Stay where you are. Hello, Warren. All these years I thought you were dead, Sadler. Make any sudden moves and you will be. Step away from the device. You want to protect the time line? Send me home. I can prevent Liber8 from ever coming to 2077. I can make sure none of this ever happens! (BEEPS) I can make things right. And then I will destroy the device, and nobody will ever use it again. That's all I've ever wanted. To put the pieces back together, and return to my family! That might be true... But there will still be an anomaly. A glitch in the continuum. You. I'm prepared to die for what I believe in. I don't think you are. I say we roll the dice. Man :  Prisoners, take your positions on the table. What the hell? Kiera : Alec... I can go home! I know, but I have to save her. Alec, no! No, Alec, no! No! (KIERA SOBS) Damn. (GRUNTING) (WHISPERS) Where am I? What about Lucas? It's being arranged. The damage has passed. Except for Sadler. He's no longer our concern. In this time line. Kiera : I killed you... I killed you... You're dead. I killed you... Woman : Let me out of here! Curtis, behind you! I gotta get out of here! God damn it! Woman : Why can't somebody help me? Curtis, I wanna go home! Let me out of here!
