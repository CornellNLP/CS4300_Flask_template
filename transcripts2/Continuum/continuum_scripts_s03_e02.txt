 Previously on Continuum... 
 He went back to save Emily. 
 Emily is in danger. 
 I'm from the future. 
 The future a week from now. 
 In a few hours Kiera is going to arrest Lucas and recover the rest of the time travel device. 
 I need to change things a little. 
 A tweak here, a push there. 
 What are you doing? 
 Disabling all the CCTV surveillance in this place. 
 Two, Alec's! Two of me! 
 I have to determine which Alec Sadler will bring forth the future that you and I both want. 
 Don't drop that. 
 You acknowledge by order of the GCC that these items are subject to forfeiture under the Life Debt Relief and Rectification Statues. 
 Yes, yes just get on with it please. 
 Now that both your parents are deceased will you be remaining in the residence or return at the housing for credit? 
 Mom. 
 We're staying. 
 We've always lived here. 
 Suit yourself. 
 Citizen chip. 
 Try not to sell everything. 
 Are we getting close? 
 There are a few items I'd like to hold onto. 
 Sentimental value, you know. 
 Hold-backs are subject to a 10 percent fee to cover the cost of the service call. 
 Of course they are. 
 Nostalgia's a waste of space and energy. 
 Look. 
 Isn't it amazing? 
 Old media. 
 Hannah, where did you find this? 
 Back of the closet. 
 You don't understand. 
 This cannot stay here. 
 Kiera don't! 
 Don't! 
 What are you two doing? 
 That's contraband. 
 Seditious printed material. 
 I didn't even know we still had this. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Sentimental value only, right? 
 You are all in a world of trouble. 
 [sobbing] No. 
 [sobbing] No. 
 Who killed me? 
 Who killed me? 
 Which one are you? 
 I guess that answers which one you are. 
 You betrayed me, Alec. 
 You used me to get the time travel device to you. 
 Where is it? 
 I hid it. 
 It's safe. 
 And the other one? 
 What other...? 
 The one from this time line. 
 The one that dead me just recovered from Lucas. 
 Did you take it? 
 Is that what you came back for? 
 What? No, no!! 
 I just got here. 
 I had nothing to do with this. 
 Really? Because in the time line without two Alec Sadlers I don't get shot in the head. 
 I want to know who did this. 
 I don't know. 
 I just left you in the future. 
 Yes. 
 And now the future is catching up with you. 
 Do you have any idea the damage you've done? 
 Kiera I had to save her. 
 It was my only chance. 
 You've destroyed everything. 
 My family may never exist now thanks to you. 
 I know. 
 I know and I'm sorry. 
 I wasn't thinking. 
 If I'd known you'd end up like this, she would end up... 
 You see that? 
 You're not the only one who had to make a deal with the devil. 
 You're one of them? 
 The Freelancers sent me back to clean up your mess. 
 It is the only way I'll ever get home. 
 What does that mean? 
 I have to get rid of one Alec Sadler. 
 It might as well be you. 
 ♪ 
 Mr. Mayor! 
 Ah, it's the mayor. 
 Where are my manners? 
 I don't know you. 
 Don't worry about me. 
 Attorney-Client privilege. 
 Aha. 
 Ladies, can you um, give us a minute? 
 Okay just... 
 (whispering) 
 So you're a lawyer? 
 What's our connection? 
 Well, you work for Liber8. 
 I work for Liber8. 
 Gord Solomon. 
 Attorney. 
 Reputation Management. 
 Problem Solver. 
 Do I have a problem that needs solving? 
 Well that depends. 
 Travis and Sonya are back together. 
 Your ploy to pit them against each other seems to have backfired completely so that could qualify, yes. 
 [sighs] 
 Don't stress my friend. 
 Don't stress. 
 They have no immediate need to exact a painful and bloody revenge. 
 In fact they have plans for you. 
 Big plans. 
 The road to legitimacy they call it. 
 And it involves me, and City Hall and all the influence you can bring to bear. 
 Exciting stuff! 
 Come on, let's do a bump. 
 Let's be friends. 
 Be my friend. 
 Raincheck! 
 What's going on? 
 What is this? Someone we know? 
 [rain and thunder] 
 You could say that. 
 Carlos, I can explain. 
 Is this some kind of sick joke? 
 I know this is a lot to take in but I need your help. 
 With what? 
 Getting rid of her. 
 Me. 
 You could have done that yourself. 
 You wanted me to see this. 
 It makes it easier to explain. 
 When someone travels back in time to a point where they have existed, they will run into themselves. 
 And it causes problems. 
 I'm guessing he's got something to do with this? 
 Leave me out of this. 
 There are two of him as well. 
 Alive. 
 Is this something to do with Escher's murder? 
 Wait, what did you say? 
 You heard me. 
 When did this happen? 
 Earlier today. 
 What did you do? 
 Me? 
 You came back to save Emily, now Escher's dead and we have this little problem. 
 It wasn't me. 
 That's the thing, Alec. 
 It was you. 
 You wanted to change things? 
 You've changed everything. 
 Which one are you? 
 Which one of you is the Kiera that I've been working with the last year? 
 Which one of you is my partner? 
 My friend. 
 Cameron. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Hey. 
 How are you doing? 
 The network is down. 
 It's not handshaking with your CMR. 
 I can't hear or see what you're doing. 
 That's weird. 
 I'm sure it's nothing you can't fix, Alec. 
 That's the thing. 
 I lost all power here yesterday. 
 The CCTV system is down and all my maintenance subroutines are being blocked by another internal program, I can't figure out how or why. 
 Plus a bunch of stuff is moved or missing around here. 
 Including the time travel slice. 
 Have you been down here? 
 Yeah. 
 I took the slice. 
 I was at the lab looking for Emily. 
 Emily? 
 Don't worry about it too much right now but you and I need to have a serious discussion about her. 
 Okay. 
 This isn't going to be about the birds and the bees, is it? 
 No. 
 But just as important. 
 I'll stop by later, okay? Okay, bye. Holy sh1t. Any luck? Yeah. I know a place that I can stash a body. For a while. Just until I find out who killed her. Me. Carlos I know it's hard to reconcile all these contradictions, but believe it or not, I know you just as well as she did. Maybe even better. The Carlos I know stood right beside me when everybody else turned their backs. Your partner is still very much alive. [elevator ding] [knock at door] What's the latest on Escher's murder? Did a full sweep of the gallery. So far nothing. We're getting eyewitness statements and getting CCTV footage of the area. I want this made a priority. Escher was a friend of this department. Understood. Congratulations on your victory Mayor-elect Martin. What can the department do for you? Thanks. But I'm not here to talk politics. That's a refreshing change. What are you here to discuss? A deal. You're with Liber8? I'm not with anyone. They contributed to my campaign but by the time I realized who they were, it was too late. Bullshit Jim. You knew exactly who you were dealing with. I thought I could handle them. I was wrong. And now they want their pound of flesh. So you come to us in exchange for what? I need immunity. Really. Immunity in exchange for information. Details regarding Liber8. Associates, hideouts, financials and intel. And how is it you know these details? Immunity. Maybe. You need to give us a taste before I agree to anything. Hey. What's that? None of your business. Kiera I'm on your side. Really? Because I just covered up your theft of the time travel slice from other you. I'm not here to clean up your messes, Alec. I'm sorry. It was an impulse move. How is other me doing anyway? Desperately trying to figure out who sabotaged the network link to my CMR. I'm assuming that was your handiwork. Yeah I thought we'd have some awkward moments if he could hear and see everything we're up to. Good point. Although knowing you it won't take other you long to figure things out. How's Emily? She's fine. Don't screw up her life now that you've gone to all this trouble to save her. The best thing that you can do right now Alec is leave her alone. I think whoever killed me was after the time travel device. Dead me had just recovered the pieces from Lucas. Can't you replay the CCTV link from the lab? I deactivated it when I arrived. Why? I couldn't risk him seeing me. But I've been thinking. If her CMR link was still active then there's a good chance that your killer's image is still in the buffer of my... his system. I just need access to the equipment. I can get you in. Is he there? Yeah. Alright. What? You're just going to walk in? He doesn't know I'm not me. Besides, he and I have something that you and I don't. What's that? Trust. Any luck reconnecting us? On all fronts, no. Just one of many things going on down here I can't explain. Oh, good. You found it. Yeah. Under some equipment. What's going on? Nothing. I recovered the pieces from Lucas. I put them on your desk. Maybe Jason found them and wanted to put them someplace safe. And the blood? What blood? A few drops where I found the slices. I have no idea. What are you not telling me Kiera? Nothing. There is nothing to tell. This is good news. I'm one step closer to getting home, right? You hold onto it. You still have the missing piece? Yeah, I'll get it to you. You know Piron was working on a stable anti-matter power source? And bought LaRoche Energy. But I'm kind of worried that Escher's research might have died along with him. Alec, about Escher... What about him? I just think that it... [cell phone buzzing] Is everything okay? That DNA test that I did on Jason... it's a match. He's my father. I got this one. Regular gang business not interesting enough for you, Marco? You just had to hitch your wagon to a terrorist organization. This is bullshit. We don't want anything to do with Liber8. I never said anything about Liber8. What? No snappy comeback? Even want to speculate who ratted you out? Well let me guess. He just won the election and he wants to clean up his mess. Things would go a lot smoother for you if you just cooperated. Come on, man. City Hall's in the pocket of Liber8. You guys are in bed with big business. sh1t, I can't even tell you who the bad guys are anymore. Travis. I knew you'd get away. We gotta talk. We do. What's happening? Just the first step in a whole new battle strategy. Let's go. Jason. Dad. You know I never got to know my father. Have a feeling that you and I share that. So how's the changing history deal coming along? Actually that's why I'm here. In the other time line I came here with Emily in the time travel device. It brought all the freelancers. There was some shooting. She was killed. That's today. [knocking on door] You expecting someone? [knock] Hide hide hide hide hide hide. Hi. Hi. Sorry to just barge in like this. No it's good, it's fine. I just need to talk to you for a second. Oh yeah, yeah. I get it. It's one of those days huh. I, uh, I actually brought this. That's uh, dangerous. So I ran some DNA tests on you. Mhm? Where's Emily? She's on her way. Oh that's no good. That's no good. Emily... I know you're my father. Hmm. Did you hear me? Hm? Are you going to say anything? Uh, I'm not your father. No you don't understand. We're genetic matches. Father and son. Oh sh1t. Oh of course. Yeah. [coughs] So then... you're my son? Maybe. Maybe? Hey. I got your message. Just turn around. What?!! Walk. Okay, whoa, what's happening? I'm saving your life. Really? Really. Enough. You've been acting weird ever since yesterday. What's going on? I promise I'll explain everything to you ok, one day. Just give me some time to figure things out. Can you do that? Yeah, I can do that. Whatever you want Alec. Okay come on. 
 
 [elevator ding] What is going on? Oh he's moving in. [elevator ding] Ah, your friend. I'll handle this one. What are you doing here? Being a good citizen. I happened to be in the general vicinity when Mr. Escher met his unfortunate end. Hm. Of course you were. You don't seem surprised to see me alive. Should I be? What do you want? Just getting ahead of the shitstorm. And you better make sure I don't get forced into any legal situations where I have to say anything about certain things. Certain time travelers. Who are they? I don't know. Time travelers. They're no friend of the Protective, or us. What makes you think we don't have to worry about them anymore? Something the Protector said to me right before she sprung me. They have bigger problems than us. The Protector got you out. Yeah. I'll give you two a minute. You were right, Garza. Kagame was more interested in his own legacy than what was best for Liber8. I believed him because he was my teacher, my mentor. I believed the path of resistance could be shaped by dead man's final wishes, and I believe differently now. Convenient. To ensure change we must strike at the heart of the problem and strike hard. We need to rid ourselves of outsiders and reconnect to the truth that united us in the future. And how exactly do we achieve that? Well, if the enemy won't meet us in the battlefield then we must bring the battlefield to them. Give me a second. Woah woah woah woah. Your pal here was caught in the gallery's CCTV sitting with Escher, seconds before he was killed. I might have left that part out. I'm prepared to make a statement, Detective. Yes I was meeting Mr. Escher for a business face-to-face, nothing more. I came in voluntarily. Heh. What do you want me to do here? You want to pursue this? Be my guest. I have nothing to hide. Okay. [phone ringing] What's up? Nothing good. I need you back at your lab. It's not actually my lab. I can't just waltz in there whenever I want. That puts me at a distinct disadvantage. Well, you were stealthy enough to install the firewall in my CMR uplink. I need you working on solving my murder. Besides, you've always been really good at looking out for yourself, Alec. You are never going to let me live this down, are you? Not in this time line. I'll find a way to get you into the lab. I need a ride. So call a cab. You're supposed to be protecting me. Uh, no. You wanted protection which is why you're camped out here. That's not the same thing. You want to stay safe? Stay put. The City Board of Trade needs to speak to me in person. You want the top corporate CEOs in the city to come here? I really don't care. Either way I'm still down an office. Your honor. Well you should care. From what I understand, your relationship to the Piron Corp is very important to you. Being a new board member and all. What's that supposed to mean? Well it means you can point fingers because my association with Liber8 has allowed me to accomplish my goals, when you've done exactly the same thing with Piron. You compromise because that's what happens if you want to make a difference. Well maybe you don't like results. I am nothing like you. Keep telling yourself that. I need an ambulance at the stadium precinct. Oh hi. What the hell happened in there? I gave my statement. Like I said there's nothing connecting me to Escher's killer. Well, directly. I know what you did. I do a lot of things. You'll have to be a little more specific. You killed him. You killed Escher. Oh come on, don't pretend to be all broken up about it. Okay, that was odd. Can we focus, Matthew? Oh yeah, sorry. Where were we. Uh, oh yeah. We were playing a game where you seem to think you know what's going on, and that's supposed to have some kind of effect on me. Well you can save your breath because nothing you have to say is going to get you whatever it is you want. Escher was Alec's father. Huh. That I did not see coming. Alec doesn't know yet and I don't want to tell him. But I'm guessing that your little business arrangement is going to get just a bit difficult when Alec finds out you murdered his dad. I see your point. What do you want? I want what's going to happen anyway. Stay away from Alec. Um. Which one? And there it is. You really want to play this game with me Kiera? How did you find out? Well you just told me. And I'm smart, I did the math. What's that mean? Some things are obvious when you pay attention. And, you know, time travel's involved. Can we just hit the lights and get around this mess? I'm gonna be late. We can't do that sir. (Dispatch): Unit 16, cardiac arrest reported in your vicinity. The corner of Hamilton and Davie. 16 en route. We're right around the corner. Seriously? Guys, I don't have time for this! Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to settle down. We've received a 911 call and we're the closest support unit. I am ordering you to ignore that call. [sirens wailing] How long is this going to take? Oh not long at all. Congratulations on your win. Now we're all very proud of you. What do you want? Well your campaign promised accountability. We just want to make sure that you keep that promise to the voters. We've prepared a list of your demands. My demands? Our demands. I thought we all wanted the same thing, Jim. You to live. Go. Corporate interests in this city have absorbed and perverted democracy at its heart. Voters elected me to put an end to this corruption. It stretches from the boardroom to the police department. The pillars of legitimate business are merely fronts for large-scale thievery and extortion. Do you have any idea how stupid we look? Is this coming through live? It's on Liber8's website so anyone can pick it up. Alec's here. Oh, hey. Hey. What's with the kid? Inspector Dillon, meet Alec Sadler, my personal tech genius. I asked him to come in. Nice to meet you. [clears throat] I think he can help us locate the mayor. And how is he going to do that? I can hear you, you know. Then answer the question. I don't even know what we're talking about. Show him what you can do. You there? Mhm. Right, you can't talk to me in front of the other me. Nice work getting the other Alec out of here. I'm accessing your CMR. Hopefully I'll be able see who killed you. We might have a problem here. Looks like some serious video interference. Holy sh1t there's two signals. You okay? It's that DNA thing. Turns out I got it backwards. Whatever it is, I'm here for you Alec. Thanks. So listen I think I figured out a way to find out who killed the other you. Looks like both Kiera's were sending video at the time the other you was killed. Can I talk to you for a second? It may take some time but I might be able to unscramble the corrupted video. Get a good look at your murderer. Is this is your Alec or is it our Alec? What are you getting it? You know as much as I've come to terms with all the time travel super suits multiple everybodies, I need to know who I'm dealing with. Is this the Alec we can trust? Really Carlos? All I know is that this Alec has never given me any reason to believe that he wouldn't come through for us. We're all making this up as we go along, Carlos. None of us are immune for making bad decisions. No matter what time line we're from. There's some background stuff here I might be able to key into. Might be able to narrow down a location using triangulation. Well the kid knows his stuff. Great, what you got? Well the video is completely masked. Bouncing off a zillion servers so I can't possibly track the origin, but there's some background noise and video interference that may be specific to electromagnetic radiation in the area. Gotta admire his tenacity. Enough. Enough what! What? Found him. Found the mayor. Really? No way. Yeah, the live signal was being spoofed big time. But I had a worm running from months ago  from when Lucas planted a virus on our system. It was just bued in the digital signature. I activated it, and traced it back. Lucky break. Totally. Do you have an address? Yeah, I'll text it to you. Oh great. Good work, Betty. Thank you. Thanks. This is it. Abandoned warehouse. Of course, it's always an abandoned warehouse. Oh Jim. One of you should probably just shoot me now. You still there? Yup. The other you is headed back to the lab so you might want to get yourself out of there. Alright, I'll reset the network asap. I can keep working on the CMR playback of your murder remotely. Don't worry Kiera, we'll find your killer, I promise. Thank you, Alec. We'll get you out on bail tonight, but with your priors you're looking at some prison time. I can do the stint just fine. Do me a favour. Anything within reason. Put me in the same cell block as this guy. Hey Jim! You're a dead man!!! You understand me? A dead man! Where you gonna go? Sit your ass down. I'll get to you as soon as I can. In the meantime, keep your mouth shut. [chuckles] It's a way too late for that, counselor. But all this, penny-ante corruption pales in comparison to the promises that I was made by corporations such as Vickernail, Sunmanto, Vermitas and even Piron who all wanted me to... [sighs] So what do we do? Nothing. Nothing? No charges. Nobody wants to put this guy on the witness stand. Too much to lose. Hell, even Liber8 looked like heroes for kidnapping this scumbag. Nah, he's done. He just committed political suicide. If he's smart, he'll never show his face in this city again. Liber8 played this one well. Hearts and minds. I thought we were done. You know, I've always had a soft spot for wayward redheads. Orphan Annie. Anne of Green Gables. I don't have all day, Kellog. Well now that Daddy Warbucks is out of the way, I'm betting you're looking for a new sponsor. I'm finally free of Escher's grip and now you want me to work for you. Woah woah. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I really think this is a win-win for you. You get to stay close to lover boy and I keep your lies, real name and impressive rap sheet out of circulation. Fine. Bluff called. You want to tell him? Go for it. I think I know Alec well enough, he'll get over it. See ya. I'll raise you. Then raise me. Escher. Bullshit. You connect me to that, we both go down. Besides we both wanted him dead. What you need to realize is never mess with a girl who shows a propensity for deadly force. That's true, but that's not what I was thinking. I was thinking how you know Alec well enough to know that he would not get over you killing his father. Escher was... Mhm. I just found out myself. It's good to be in business with you, Red. Wow. I didn't know you were in the market. Neither did I. I was in the neighbourhood. I saw the For Lease sign and I recognized it immediately. This is the home I grew up in. My parents, my grandparents. We all lived right here. I learned some pretty hard lessons in this place. [Thinking] What are you doing? Calling CPS. Yeah, I see multiple prohibited items. We're going to need a forensic cataloging team in here. Search the entire premises. How much is that going to cost me? Believe me ma'am; the cost is the least of your worries now. Unregistered media, analog or printed materials, physical video or audio media is classified contraband and subject to seizure under Section 702 of the Domestic Intelligence Surveillance Act. It must be surrendered immediately. That's what the law says. You have it memorized. I was bringing that box to you. I don't want this on my record. I plan to join the military. Fight against the subversives. Really? I have a public service recruitment pass. It's um, it's worth 1000 life credits to me if you use it. I can transmit it via Citizen chip. No CPS search? No. And, I'll knock 10,000 off your mother's LifeDebt. It won't zero it out but it'll come close. Okay. I'll come back for the rest of this later. You know ma'am, you could learn a thing or two from your daughter. You don't think, Kiera. That was a commitment you just made. They'll expect you to honor it. I intend to. I can't believe you. Tell me you did that to get me out of trouble. I didn't. I believe in this war, Mom. I want to make a difference. I'm gonna try to calm Hannah down. Prove to me that I can trust you, Alec. Prove to me that you're the one that can send me back to my time. I'm done with time travel. I'm out of the family business from this moment. I just want to make sure Emily's happy. That's all that matters to me. The longer I'm involved with all of this, just the worse it's going to get for you and me. The other me, that is. The important thing is that you love her. She loves you. As long as you don't tell the other me the truth then everything will work itself out. What about me getting back to my family? Is that just going to sort itself out? I don't know. All I know is if there is a way back for you then I'm not the guy to help you find it? Who is? You know who. Hey. Hi. Want some help? Actually I think I need to be alone tonight. Start tomorrow? Okay. [moody music] [gunshot] [moody music] ♪
