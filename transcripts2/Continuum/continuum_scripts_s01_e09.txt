 Narrator : Previously on Continuum... 
 He was anticipating my every move! 
 More advanced than you? 
 I've been thinking, about you and me. 
 There is no you and me. 
 Your secret's safe with me. 
 Ready to make a change, Julian? 
 It was for the cause. 
 For Liber8. 
 You're always saying we need to stand up... 
 No. I never advocated violence. 
 Show a little bit of respect! 
 I'm done with you, from this moment on. 
 CPS official : Whiskey Romeo Bravo, in pursuit of suspects. 
 Requesting assistance. Whiskey Romeo Bravo, searching. Over. Kiera : This is Vancouver CPS. Hold your position. What the hell happened back there? You told me you were going for a job interview! And I got so much more. You know what this is? Of course. They're thermalite detonators. That's why I stole them. I know I'm your brother and all, but this is crazy. Kagame's supposed to meet us here. Liber8? You told me you were done with that. Alpha One, Tango spotted. Let's go. Come on! Positive identification, Matthew and Laura Kellog. Requesting permission to engage, sir. CPS officer : Whiskey Romeo Bravo, permission granted. Over. Firing. CPS officer : Whiskey Romeo Bravo, report. Positive contact, two suspects. I think one of them is injured. On descent. Stand by to mobilize. (CRIES IN AGONY) You gotta go. You gotta go, Matt. I'm not leaving you. I'm not leaving you. Get these to Kagame. Now. No. He'll find you. Just run. You gotta go. Go! You've only got seconds. You're gonna go to jail. (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (SIGHS) The country. It's amazing! Yeah, if you like the smell of cow crap. Fertilizer can be used to make bombs and you're part of the gang task force, so... Mmm-hmm. Oh, come on, we get a day in the country! We can see horses and cows... It's amazing. Excuse me, sir, we're looking for Mr. Randol. Mmm-hmm. That's me. I'm agent Kiera Cameron, this is my partner Detective Carlos Fonnegra. We'd like to talk to you. All right. Well, we're talking. Question is, why? Sellers of ammonium nitrate are required to call us when a large fertilizer order's placed. And you've been identified as someone making such an order. So, you're what? The sh1t police? We got 10 working acres, five more in the back field. Hardly use enough fertilizer to be suspicious. Well, they said you ordered 1,500 kilograms. Well, that's impossible. Okay, can I see your invoices for all of your recent purchases? You put it like I have a choice. I, uh, found Brandy's warming blanket. Roland : All right, good. Oh, my God, what are you doing here? Roland : You know my son? Kiera : 2077. My time, my city, my family. When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. They had other plans. (EXPLOSION) A time-travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on was me. Alec, do you know this woman? Uh, no, not her You, you were on the news last month, right? A suspect in a murder case. Yeah, I was, uh, cleared of all suspicions, that was a mistake. And now that we've got that sorted out, let me see those invoices, Mr. Randol. Yeah, of course. I've nothing to hide. Alec, uh, put her in the pasture. I'll, uh, I'll keep an eye on the boy. Okay. The "boy"? "What are you doing here?" You startled me. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I didn't know this was your farm. Your father ordered a large supply of fertilizer. We have to check these things out. He's my stepfather. It's probably for the back acre. It's been fallow. You wanna see my setup? This is impressive. Right? Wow. Hey, what did you do to it? I hacked it And black is so much cooler than copper. Ask any nerd. It just needs one more systems check. If you're gonna be around the next 20 minutes, I can do it now. I've missed you. Alec, do you have a license for this? Uh, yeah, that's my stepdad's, and he does. I just use it to kill rats. They get into the equipment and chew on the cables. Is your stepfather involved in anything that might seem radical? Roland's not some al-Qaeda in the making, if that's what you're thinking. But... There's no buts. Your stepbrother Julian was involved in those riots a few months back. That was nothing, just teenage angst. (SCOFFS) You're scanning me? Are you serious? After everything I've done for you? Where's the trust? I could ask you the same question. Are you hiding something, Alec? No, I'm not hiding anything. You know what, this is gonna take longer than I thought. We should probably get back. Your partner's probably wondering where you are. Well, we bought 438 kilograms this year. How much did they say that we ordered? Uh, 1,500 kilograms. No. Okay, can you show me where you keep the fertilizers, so I can check it out? You don't trust our word? Mr. Randol, if I go back to my boss and tell him I didn't personally inspect the property, then he's just gonna send someone else out here to bother you. So if you wanna make things easier... What would be easier is if the government didn't poke its nose in where it doesn't belong. (CLEARS THROAT) (SIGHS) All right, come on. Vickerdale Enterprises have patented terminator seeds that kill the crops of neighboring farms and then take root in that farm's soil. They advocate mono-cropping, which strips the land of its nutrients. This will continue, and by 2030, all food cultivation will be controlled by Vickerdale. Hey, you know what Dad's doing? Oh, there's a police officer here investigating some mix-up with an order of fertilizer. He's showing me where they keep the fertilizer. Mr. Randol, where's your son Julian? Julian : What do you want? Hey, do you boys know anything about a fertilizer delivery? No. Uh-uh. Detective Fonnegra wants to look inside the storage barn. Well, does he have a warrant? Roland : He doesn't need one. I'm gonna show him what's inside. What's going on? Nothing. Where'd this lock come from? Don't look at me. I didn't do it. Get the bolt cutters. Julian, you were involved in the riots recently, isn't that correct? My son made a mistake. We've had a talk, he's been punished. Unless you wanna jail him for poor judgment, I suggest we drop the matter. I think you'll see that this has all been a huge mistake. Whose van is this? Kiera : Oh, my God. Looks like we're gonna have to take you in for questioning, Mr. Randol. Yeah, I'm calling this in. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Drop the gun! Mr. Randol, get away from the barn. Hoyt, what are you doing? Drop the gun! Julian, get their guns and phones. Drop the gun, Hoyt. Julian, this is not the way to go. Boys, think about what you're doing. Julian, listen to me, listen to me. Carlos : I know you boys think you're helping your friend by coming out here, but you're committing a major crime. Oh, we're beyond that. Kiera : No, you're not. We can all go home, it ends easily. No one gets hurt. You can help stop this. It's all just been one big misunderstanding. Ann : Roland? (GUNSHOT) (COCKS SHOTGUN) Everybody down! On the ground now! Weapons on the ground! Carlos : Give me your phone. Look out! (GUNSHOT) Carlos! Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon or your partner dies! (MOANS IN PAIN) Drop it! Roland : Julian, my God, what are you doing? Julian! We're in control now. We're in control now. You sure know how to show a girl a good time. Oh, yeah. Nothing says fun like a GSW. See if you can find something to bind these towels with. There's only one guy on the other side of the door. I figure we can take him down, grab his gun The more we move you... We've gotta get you to a hospital. No, no, no. I'll be okay. (GROANS) There's not many options in here. I'm just gonna give him this. Hey. I thought you could use this Sewing kit would've been more helpful. How's he doing? Oh... What's going on out there? Uh, Julian and Hoyt are meeting outside, they've got Roland and my mom in the kitchen at gunpoint. Roland convinced them to let me bring this to you, but I'm supposed to go right back. Alec, I don't know how but you're gonna have to help us get out of here. I don't know, I mean, they're watching me pretty closely. And this door's pretty thin. I'm sure Gates can hear what we're saying right now. Gates : Pretty much. (MOANS) You know, I think this kit's gonna be helpful after all. (DOOR OPENS) Just me, I'm just leaving. I'm gonna see if my mom has any food. Do you want anything? Yeah, a sandwich would be... Okay... Okay, they're coming back and they're expecting me. You and Carlos get out of here while I distract them. (WHISPERS) Okay, what about you? I'll be fine here. I'm not leaving my mom. So what's the plan? Get to the car, radio for help. Get the hell out of here. Sounds like a good plan. Great. Ow! You think you can do this? Yeah, I got it. Kiera : Don't die on me now. Oh, we Fonnegras are pretty hardy stock. Good cake, Mrs. Randol. Ann : Thanks, Dan. (ANN SIGHS) Julian, listen to me. No. Listen to me! Now we're gonna tie up our prisoners. That's the plan. Prisoners, that's what we are now, huh? Be quiet. If you'd just think about it, you'd understand. Understand what? This is the next logical step, Mr. Randol. You taught us the corporations don't care about us. They're in control of the government, we're on our own, and you were right about all of that. (DISHES CRASHING) Sorry. Now, the bastards took your damn farm. But what you weren't right about was that a grassroots movement could stop them. We don't need civil disobedience here. We need revolution. Roland : Boys... We're not children. No, you're right, you're men. Old enough to think things through. Now, I understand your frustration, I get it. But if you continue down this path, you're gonna be stopped before you can start. I don't hear anyone coming to stop us, Mr. R. (CLEARS THROAT) Hoyt : All right, we gotta cover our tracks. Dan, get the keys to the cops' car. No, no, no wait! I... Wait, I can get the keys. Kiera : Just a few more steps. Where are the keys, Carlos? Front right pocket. Aren't you gonna buy me a drink first? (KIERA LAUGHS) Still have your sense of humor. All right... (GUNSHOT) (GUNS COCKING) Hoyt : Where do you think you're going? Woman operator : 9-1-1... (COUGHING) Mom, are you okay? Dan, put the gun down. You're startling her. Don't try anything! We won't, Dan. We're not gonna try to escape. Just put the gun down. I admire your spirit. But it'll get you killed, you know. My partner needs help. You don't want the blood of a cop on your hands. (CARLOS PANTING) Listen, the sooner you cooperate, the sooner you'll get help. Sir, there's a hostage situation at a farm in Surrey. Do we know who? No confirmation, but it's the place where Carlos and Kiera were going. Oh, my God, Julian, the detective is hurt really badly. He needs a doctor. I know what he needs. We've got a dying cop... You're holding us hostage... ls what you have in the barn some kind of bomb? Hoyt : Everybody, shut up! All right, here's how this is gonna go down. No one is gonna die. We're gonna tie you two up, and we're gonna quietly make our way out of here, all right? With a little luck, someone will eventually come looking for you. My partner is not gonna make it that long. Julian, he needs a doctor. We'll call an ambulance from a payphone once we're gone. Our fight is with the corporations. Fair enough. (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) I thought I said to get their phones. I did. Well, you obviously missed a couple. What do we do now, Hoyt? Give yourselves up. I'll tell them you didn't mean to shoot Detective Fonnegra. I'll say that it was an accident. (SIRENS WAILING) Hoyt : Phil... I want you to go out to the storage barn and keep watch until I get there. I have a better idea... We start the revolution now. Ram the van into the police barricade. We do Day One right now, that's it. No, we need to escape. We're gonna make our statement on our terms, not theirs. What's Day One? Theseus Day. He was a warrior who unified the people of Athens. He was also pushed off a cliff when people turned against him. Yeah, well some challenges are worth the risk. I've seen thousands of innocents killed for a cause. Do you know what they called the activists? Dan : Heroes? Murderers. If you want your message heard, don't use violence. Carlos : You guys should turn yourselves in. Become celebrities. The police are gonna have this place surrounded within minutes. You cannot escape. No, they don't know the place like I do. We can do this. I want spotters in place. Cordon off the perimeter. Full sit-rep briefing in 10 minutes. You got it. Got two of mine inside, Fonnegra and Cameron. You understand that when a bomb is involved, public safety is top priority, then officers on the scene. If we can't negotiate, then we go in. Look, I know how this works. If it comes to that, just make sure your team knows who's who. They're beginning surveillance. What you need is a diversion. Hoyt : Shut up! No, she's right. Oh, good, you're listening to her now. Just hear me out... We tell them we're gonna detonate the bomb. Instead, we blow up the propane tank. They're gonna think that's the bomb. When they're looking for the dead bodies, we're gone through the woods. Except that we happen to have five witnesses who know exactly where we're going. No. We're not gonna kill them, that's not what we're about. You got a psychological profile on this guy? My people are working on it. Do you have a sense of their arsenal? Not yet. Is that all the guns? Looks about right. That's not all of them. Hoyt : What are you talking about now, bitch? What did you say? Nothing. Hey, I got your dad's rat pistol in my workshop. Hoyt : Dan, go get it. Uh, he's never gonna find it in there. All right, just don't do anything stupid. Go with him. Julian : Gates! Go lock those two in the pantry. Let them get used to our presence, then we'll make contact. Bradley... Randol's record is clean. Vickerdale Enterprises bankrupted him two years ago. He's been living on his wife's property, holding anti-corporation rallies since then. Clearly, he's escalated. Sir, we've got a sighting. Kids. He's using kids. Wow. First person shooter. (GUNSHOTS) Hey, stop! Sorry, I'm just checking my emails. Uh, I think the gun is behind that suit somewhere. (GROANS) One for the good guys. 
 
 Kiera : I have a plan. Yeah, you wanna tell me what it is? Of course not. Alec :  Kiera? Alec. What? I don't have much time. They're expecting me back soon. You've got me here. What do you want me to do? Connect me to Inspector Dillon. Who are you talking to? Okay, just a second. Aw, come on. Did you patch me through to their phone? Good and ready to go, sir. (CELL PHONE RINGS) This is Dillon. Bingo! (DAN MOANS) Hello? Sir, it's Cameron. Kiera? Bradley! Hey, can we keep it down! Kiera, what's the situation? How many assailants? Five. Armed with handguns and shotguns. There are three hostages. Two of them are in the kitchen. One of them is in the barn. Carlos and I are in the pantry, and Carlos has been shot. Dillon : How bad? Kiera : It's not good. Listen, They are going to explode the propane tank as a diversion  and escape through back roads. I'll have the chance to take out the leader. Cameron, this is ERT Commander Bradley. My team are in position, let them do their job. Stand down, keep your partner alive. Kiera : With all due respect, sir. I am unwilling to stand down because if nothing is done, my partner dies. Bradley : Cameron. Listen to me very carefully... The first priority is to defuse that bomb before Randol can detonate it. What's going on? Kiera : No, sir... Hello? Roland Randol is... He's a hostage! She's gone. Hello? Sir? Wow, you really got a good shock from that. Told you not to touch that wire. You okay? Hey, what are you doing? Just getting more towels for the bleeding cop. Is Cameron gonna screw this up? I trust her instincts. Yeah, well the last thing I need is a hothead running around, getting people killed. She's not gonna be a problem. I hope you're right. Everything's gonna be okay. (BREATHES HEAVILY) You're a lousy liar. Despite all the lies, I still trust you. More than anyone. Although your name's probably not even Kiera. My name is Kiera Cameron. I have a little boy and a husband that I'm likely to never see again. If I don't do everything right while I'm here, they may never exist. And the only friend I have... I lie to him every day. (WHISPERS) But  I  hate it. (SNIFFLES) I'm sorry, Carlos. Can I get this to the cops? Why are you being so cooperative all of a sudden, huh? You got the guns and the manpower. I'm not stupid. Drop it off, then come back. (DOOR OPENS) I think you can use these. Yeah, towels, thank you. Okay, then. (PHONE RINGING) Answer it. Don't answer it! They're trying to help! (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Is anyone gonna answer the phone? (PHONE RINGS) (BEEP) Hello? Mr. Randol, are you there? Yes, I'm... (ANN GASPS) Yeah, yeah, I'm Roland Randol. Mr. Randol, this is Martin Bradley of the VPD. Carlos? This is my plan. I'm gonna lead them all outside and one by one, I'm gonna pick 'em off. You're a good man, Carlos. (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) You have hostages, one of them hurt, Carlos Fonnegra, how is he? He's alive. The others, are they okay? Julian : Yeah, yeah, they're okay. Roland, can I call you Roland? I know what happened with your farm, I can only imagine... All right, enough chitchat! We are not afraid to die to have our statement heard. Who's speaking now? Mr. Randol? The world has turned its power over to the corporations. We cry out for our rights and no one listens. We voted against them, nobody listens. The only way to make people listen is to give our lives. Hey. Wait, we're listening. We've got TV crews, we've got press, Internet. What the... (GROANS) If I see a cop within 100 yards of this place, I kill everyone! No, no, no, wait! Nobody has to die. Gates! Stay here. Tell us what we need to know. Mr. Randol? (GUN SHOT FIRING) Mr. Randoll Shots fired! All units, go! Hoyt : You let them escape? Julian : What the hell happened? Damn it! You okay? (BREATHES HEAVILY) We've got to find them. Ugh! Hey, get up. You're coming with me. Stay with the hostages. No, Hoyt, stick to the plan! Bradley! Bradley : What the hell? Hoyt? Alec. Alec! Alec! Hoyt? (PANTING) (GRUNTS) Okay, tie him up, put him in the pantry, get Dillon on the phone. Tell him the house is clear, and when the EMTs get here, bring them to Carlos immediately. Okay. Roland : Alec, what's going on? I'm going after Hoyt. (FOOTSTEPS) Theseus! ERT OFFICER 11 Cover! Now! Take a shot. (GUNSHOTS FIRED) ERT OFFICER 23 Return fire! We've got gunfire being exchanged on the northeast corner  and a sniper in the storage barn. The bomb is in the barn. A stray shot could set it off. Hold fire on that position unless you can get a clean shot. Roger. I just got a phone call from someone inside the house claiming the house is clear. Get your team to the house, see if you can recover the hostages. Roger that. Reporter : We have now confirmed, a militant group headed up by Roland Randol have taken hostages on a Surrey farm. Sonya : What's going on? Theseus. It's started. Reporter : ERT are on the scene and we've had reportings of gunfire. We'll have more as the story develops. Well, isn't there something we should do? They could kill him. No, don't worry. Everything I am, everything I become will be the result of events unfolding on that farm. ERT OFFICER 32 Get back! (INDISTINCT TALKING) Ugh! (SIGHS) ERT officer 4 : Move, move, let's go! Roland : Alec, quick! Get your mom. (EXCLAIMS) Ann : Oh, my God! Get your mom. Oh, my God. Check that those back roads are covered. Where are we on the hostages? Approaching the house. ERT officer 5 : Move, move! ERT officer 6 : Go, go! What are you doing here? You said you were gonna leave. (PANTING) I came back to get you. What? Are you gonna take him hostage? (PANTING) I'm here to help you. If the cops find you they're not gonna let you go, Dad. Son, look at me. Look at me. Listen to me. Just listen, okay? Listen, if you want me to come with you, I'll come, okay? (BREATHES HEAVILY) I'm beggin' you, don't do this. Don't! Get out of the way. Gates : Hey! What? Let's make a break for it. You go, coward. We didn't build a bomb for nothing. Don't move! Put the gun down, turn yourself in. You know that's the only way this ends. I... I'm warning you! (GUNSHOT FIRED) It just went off. Julian... OFFICER ON LOUDSPEAKER This  is  the VPD- Put your weapons down and come out! Alpha one, Tango's in the house. Positive ID, Randol. (BREATHES HEAVILY) You made your statement, Son. I understand, God! (SIGHS) You came back to save me and I will stand beside you, I swear to God I will, but... (SIGHS) It's over, Son. There's nowhere to run. It's over, Son. I love you, but please. No. Please. No. Please. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. No. It's all my fault. No. I'm so sorry. (SOBBING) (SNIFFLING) (GUNSHOT FIRED) (GLASS BREAKS) (SCREAMS) No! (WAILING) No! Target's down. We got him. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No! (CRYING) That's my mother! What are you doing? What are you doing? You killed my husband. You asshole, that's my mother! Identify yourself. I'm Alec Sadler, this is Ann Roland, this is my mother. We're unarmed. These are the hostages. (ANN WAILING) Target terminated. He was not a target, he was my husband. He was my husband. (SOBBING) Where's the other boy that was here? (SIREN WAILING) Put your guns down now! This place is surrounded. Hoyt, do as your friend is doing. It only takes one bullet to make our statement. We'll all be martyrs. The message will be heard. Ugh! (GASPING) (SIREN WAILING) Alec? They're done talking to your mom. You can go in now. How's Carlos? He's critical. But they're taking him to the nearest hospital. I'm so sorry about your dad. He's my stepdad. Yeah. Should I go with him? Dillon : He's in good hands. Why don't you let me take you back to the precinct, we'll get you debriefed. You Okay? Yeah. He's out of surgery. Doctors say he tolerated it well, whatever the hell that means I hear Fonnegras are pretty hardy stock. They say his prognosis is good. Go home and get some sleep. Okay. (SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLES) Permission to come aboard? These older scotches have a subtle smoky aftertaste that's divine. Just take a sip. Ora... (SIGHS) Ora gulp. You, uh, you in a hurry? Well, that depends. Does this conversation come in interesting? Hey, you're the one that came to me. I seem to be present for all of your significant losses. Your grandmother, your sister. You've only got seconds. You're gonna go to jail. (COUGHING) I'm not leaving you. Get up. Not yet! Now I'll go. Kiera : I'm sorry. You're doing your job, right? I mean... You made it sound like it's your fault. Besides, what happened in the future stays in the future. Look, for what it's worth, I forgive you. Why? Let me put it this way. You and I will never be able to relate to these people the way that we relate to each other. The two of us are in on a joke that eight billion others on the planet won't ever get. I can think of a few others that might get it. Forget about them for a second. You know I'm right. Why else would you be here? Getting drunk. I'm married. There you're married. Here you're alone. Like me. Tomorrow's not promised, Kiera. Maybe it's best to stop living for a future that might not even happen. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Man : Do you recognize my voice? Yes. Stay where you are. Within the hour I will have someone pick you up. They will give you clothes and food and a safe place to stay. Then we will meet.
