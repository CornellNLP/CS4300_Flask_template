 Teresa : This season on "Queen of the South"... 
 What are you reading there? What are you doing,  gato? 
 (gunshot) Aah! 
 Don't move. 
 You leave me now, you die. 
 Teresa : I was running from Epifanio and stumbled into Camila's new route. 
 She could've killed me. She didn't. 
 They killed Guero. 
 Are you working for that  puta? 
 What happened? 
 I shot him. 
 That's not who I am. That's not who I want to become. 
 I'm going to be governor of Sinaloa. 
 It's my business, too. 
 You can't run the business and be in an election. 
 Camila : The only thing my husband cannot afford is to fight a war. 
 So while he's distracted, I'm gonna take over. 
 Isabela. 
 This is about you. 
 You just want to use me against him. 
 These coordinates. 
 I'm gonna have to go back to Mexico. 
 Why shouldn't I call Epifanio and tell him you're here? 
 Why not kill you? 
 Brenda! 
 Run!

 Brenda? Brenda!

 So nice to see you again. 
 Man : (speaking Spanish)_ 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Senor Vargas, do you have anything to add to your comments on cartel violence last night? 
 Does this signal a deeper wave of cartel conflict to come? 
 I have no further comments on yesterday's unforgivable violence. 
 Today's a day for the people of Sinaloa to have their voices heard. 
 And if they make the right choice, I guarantee that for the next six years, this state will enjoy prosperity. 
 Thank you all very much. Thank you. 
 One last question, Senor Vargas. 
 Senor Vargas, one last question, please. 
 Last question.

 Have you heard from Batman yet? 
 No. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What about my wife? Think she got to him? 
 At this point, anything is possible. 
 I want everyone on the payroll to have their eyes and ears out for anything out of the ordinary. 
 I can't have any more surprises.

 ♪ ♪ 
 Some surprises are better than others. 
 The Mendoza girl, they found her. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Bueno. That's the kind of news I like. (Latin music playing) ♪ ♪ Isabela? ♪ ♪ (music silences) Thank you, Violetta. At least someone has some respect around here. Do you girls want something to eat? No. Well, I have to go to a meeting now. I'll be back shortly. Take your time. Violetta, could you finish the tutoring later, please? Of course. No! I want her to stay and hear everything. She's the only person I trust. I need people I can trust now that I can't show my face in school anymore. (tense music) Talk to your mom. ♪ ♪ Isabela, look at me, please. There is a reason for what I did. I was forced to be away from you. That's not true. Oh, yes, it is. I know I told you I had to go because I needed to tend to the business in Texas, but the truth is, your father drove me away. And I came back home to reclaim my life. And you... you are the most important part of it. ♪ ♪ I went through so much during our marriage. I built this business. You know how hard I worked. And he wanted to control it. And to control me. He wanted to turn me into something I'm not. That's right. A mother, his wife. Those things you are not. ♪ ♪ Why is it that he is allowed to be a father and a husband and a businessman, and I am not? You left. ♪ ♪ This is gonna work out. You'll see. ♪ ♪ (phone buzzes) Hello? I'm on my way to the airport now. Camila : Good. How's it going? Any reaction from Epifanio? Well, he won't retaliate until after the election. It's then when we should be ready. Have a safe flight. (dramatic music) Let's go. ♪ ♪ Keep an eye on her. ♪ ♪ Where is Brenda? My recommendation? You better start worrying about yourself, Teresita. ♪ ♪ You caused a lot of problems for one  morra,  eh? (tense music) ♪ ♪ She keeps looking at me. What is it? Do you think that I'm pretty? Teresa, do you know what the hardest thing is when you get shot in the face? Chewing. I haven't had a  pinche  piece of steak in weeks. And I used to live off that sh1t. No cow, no pig. The only pig I get is this piece of cartilage they used to rebuild my cheekbone. It suits you. ♪ ♪ (speaking Spanish)_ ♪ ♪ (speaking Spanish)_ Get back to the campaign headquarters... I want them again. Aurelio. Epifanio. Thank you for coming on short notice. Of course. How are you? Good to see you again. Good to see you, too.

All of Don Epifanio's lieutenants are supposed to be in Culiacan. No one's supposed to be here. Juan Carlos is here. I'm looking at him right now. (indistinct chatter) He's arriving at Jorge's. Xander's here too. If something's going down, you should tell me. ♪ ♪ Don Epifanio? Pardon. Si. Our federale says something's going on. Juan Carlos is at Jorge's with Xander. They're all gathering together having a meeting without you. What does that mean? He's not supposed to be in town. We'll have to find out. Hello. ♪ ♪ Teresa Mendoza, this is Aurelio Casillas. Mucho gusto. The book your boyfriend, Guero, gave you is causing his cartel as much grief as it is ours. And unfortunately, there are a lot of stories about me and my dealings with Don Epifanio in that book. Who did you give it to? Who's holding the book for you? Is that even true? I don't think it is. I don't think you gave it to someone. I think you're just trying to save your life. Doesn't matter what you think anymore. Why not? Because like I told El Limpiador, if something happened with us, I would disappear. The information would go out. You missed the deadline. It's gone to the Mexican government, the federales, the press, the DEA, and the rival cartels. If the federales don't kill you, the other cartels will. Epifanio : She's lying. She's trying to keep us unstable, keep the ground moving beneath our feet. It's a tactic of my wife's. And you learned it very well. I can see you picked up a few things. Are you willing to bet on that? I know every trick in Camila's book. This is how she deceives us into thinking that she has the upper hand. Doesn't make sense. If the book is out, how does that help me? She's right. She would not be of use for us if that were true. We'll kill her. (chuckles) Don't underestimate the cunning of what you are witnessing. It's a craft. She's simply buying time. I don't think she gave the book to anyone. (tense music) Imagine living this type of warfare for 25 years. ♪ ♪ What about your friend at El Limpiador's? She didn't have the tutelage of Camila's. And what those men back there are doing to her? (chuckles) ♪ ♪ If we don't have a name within an hour, it's because there isn't one. ♪ ♪ One hour. ♪ ♪ She's all yours. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ (intense music) ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ (speaking Spanish)_ Sit, please. There is one thing about my husband. He is a very gifted liar. Took me many years to find that out. Those poor voters, they never stood a chance. (tense music) Anyway, gentlemen, we're here to discuss business, so I'd like to start now. I'm sure you're all aware that ever since I left, profits have dropped 15%. I made a deal with Jimenez. I gave them a piece of my Dallas operation, and in return, they will move our product. In addition to that, I want to regain market share, and in order to do so, I need to increase shipment by 30% a month. How? We don't have the infrastructure to move that amount. Ah, but we do now. You see, I told my attorney to acquire a trawling company. It's a fleet of eight ships. Enough to move what we need. The name of my attorney is Teo Aljarafe. Those are his business cards, and you'll take one before you leave. He's gonna be handling our legal affairs from now on, so if you have any problems with law enforcement or any legal entanglements, you are to call him. Do you understand? (speaking Spanish) Good. ♪ ♪ Sweetheart, welcome. Please have a seat. We're discussing new business. Get out. I want to talk to my wife. No. They don't take orders from you anymore. They work for me now. I don't know what my wife told any of you, but let's put an end to this nonsense now. You work for me. She's not, nor will she ever be, running this business. So leave, go home. Now. All of you. (clears throat) ♪ ♪ 
 
 What do you think you're doing? This is my business. I built it. And you took it away from me. So I just took it back. You're gonna regret this. You're not getting away with this. Think I'm just gonna stand by and say nothing? Actually, yes. That's exactly what I think. Because if you make a move against me, everything I know about you and your past will come out. What do you think that will do to your political career? So, yes, my love, you're gonna do nothing. And I'm afraid you're not welcome here anymore. It's time for you to leave. ♪ ♪ Oh, look. (chuckles) You've won. You see, it's not such a bad day for you after all, Governor. ♪ ♪ Where's my daughter? She's home, with me. Where she belongs. You really think I'm gonna let you keep her away from me? Probably not, but it won't matter. She'll choose me. She knows who you are now. I'm done protecting you. It's ironic. You were always asking if I was trying to turn her against you... when it's really the opposite. ♪ ♪ (snaps fingers) ♪ ♪ (man speaking Spanish) ♪ ♪ Time's up,  puta. I bet you 2,000 there are no copies. She gave that book to no one. Right,  mamacita? In fact, I bet that book is under a mattress. (grunts) (groans) (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ (banging) ♪ ♪ (grunts) Don't move. Don't reach for your gun. Oh, you gonna shoot? You gonna shoot? You're not gonna shoot.

And you're about to take one yourself. Turn on the news. (speaking Spanish)_ We better get you the hell out. Get you back. I'm gonna arrange a plane. What has he done? James : He's lit our world on fire. I'm coming to get you. (tense music) ♪ ♪ (gun clicks) Can you point that somewhere else? Just drive. We looked for you everywhere after you escaped Culiacan. Now tell me, how did you get to Texas, start working for Camila? Her men brought me to her when they found me on one of her mule routes. Is that where you're taking me? To see Camila? No. So where are we going then? To El Limpiador's. I need to get Brenda. (chuckles) Are you crazy? No one is expecting me to be back. When Gato was raping me, why did you try to stop him? 'Cause it ain't right. I don't care what the circumstances are. And believe it or not, I'm not the worst person in the world. I know. I just killed the worst person in the world. (phone chimes) Who's texting you? They probably found Gato. Get it. ♪ ♪ What is it? It's Epifanio. He's using the military. He just took out Xander and Juan Carlos. He's killing everybody and burning everything. He destroying everything so Camila can't have it. You're lucky you're here. Epifanio would have killed you once you were no longer useful. Give me the phone. (phone buzzing) Hello. Teresa : It's Teresa. I know what Epifanio's doing to you. If you want to survive, you have to meet me. I'm in Mexico. What are you talking about? You wanted to know why Epifanio was chasing me. I have a book Guero gave me with names, numbers, locations. It has information about you, your husband, and how you got to where you are. If you want to get out from under this, come meet me at El Limpiador's. Higueras. I know where that is. Go now. It's not a good idea just to walk up to El Limpiador's farm. ♪ ♪ At least not the front way. Do you know the farm? Yes. Why would you help me? Seeing what's happening to my friends, and you letting me live, it's more than that  pinche cabron  Epifanio would ever do for me. ♪ ♪ Teresa, you don't need to hold a gun on me. Gato deserved what he got, but the rest of our guys didn't. They were my friends. ♪ ♪ Now let's go get yours. ♪ ♪ Isabela? Isabela? Isabela? Isabela? Isabela, we have to go. Get your stuff. Now. Violetta, go downstairs. The driver will take you home. Thank you, Camila. I'm not going anywhere. Isabela, we have to go. We're going to Dallas. Dallas? Not a chance. You expect for things to be the same since you left? I spent a year without you with him. He took care of me, and right now, he just became governor, if you haven't noticed, and you stop me from being there with him. I noticed he became the governor. You have no idea how much I noticed. Now we have to go. Come on. I'm not going anywhere. I am not asking, Isabela. Come on. Get off of me. I don't want to leave! Isabela, we don't have time for this, come on. Grow up. I hate you! Well, you can hate me all you want and you can blame me for whatever you need. I don't care, Isabela. Stop! You're not going with your father. I am your mother and I will protect you, even if it is against your will. This isn't about Dad. This is about you. I don't want to be with you. And if you take me right now, I'll never forgive you. Besides, all I'll do is just come back here anyway. (tense music) ♪ ♪ Fine. ♪ ♪ I do love you. ♪ ♪ Barbaro... Take her back to him. Take her to her father's house. (door opens, closes) Camila?

(grunting) (gagging) (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ Camila : Turn around. We're not going to Higueras. We're going to the airport. I thought you wanted to meet Teresa and get the book. How do I know she wasn't asking me to meet her with Epifanio's gun to her head? Maybe the book doesn't even exist. Maybe it's an excuse to get me there. I underestimated Epifanio way too many times. Never again. I think she's telling the truth. Yeah? Why? Because if I know her, I know the one person that she mistrusts more than you. It's Epifanio. I believe her. Are you willing to bet your life on it? James : I am. She was trouble for me. She'll be trouble for you, too. (tense music) (man speaking Spanish on TV) (grunting) (man speaking Spanish on TV) Jose?

The disease of corruption and violence, brought on by the murderous cartels, who for too long have ruled over this great state through fear, needs to stop. Now they will know what it is to be afraid. During these attacks, over 50 cartel members were killed and hundreds of millions of dollars of cocaine destroyed. But it wasn't without a cost. Six soldiers gave their lives to help eradicate those who would poison, corrupt, and kill our children. Today, we honor and salute them and their families for this ultimate sacrifice.
