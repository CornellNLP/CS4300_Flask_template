So... you're a runner? [phone beeps] [line trilling] [activates speakerphone] [line trilling] Yeah? Epifanio. Yes, hello, my love. Why are you sending me a stupid message at night Just like I said.

I said I'll do it. Get her prepped. What's the point? She'll just die too. Don't worry about her. Better her than the girl you spent months training. I don't care about her. I care about getting those drugs to Han. But if she dies first, what's the point? You hired a chemist you shouldn't have, not me. So you don't have another choice but to drive faster, now, do you?

I want to dump everything I have out there and quietly start buying stock in the company stated in those documents. You want to take over a trawler company? Yes. They have a small fleet of fishing boats. And I don't want any paper trail. Okay, well, if you dump your stock in these other investments to do that, you will... lose a ton of money. I know. More than a ton. What I'm trying to say is... there must be a reason. Another way to say it is there must be a reason why you're showing up here, coming to me, whom you don't know. An even simpler way to say it is... I know who you are, and I know what you do. Cherry mint? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Is that not a terrific candy? Sour. But sweet. Like life.

Well, if by challenges you mean I take great interest in even the tiniest minutia of certain laws... and take advantage of them for my client's best interest, then... yes. I want you to guide my financial interests with an eye for the... minutia. I don't want my husband to know about it. And you're gonna get rich doing it. Richer.

I like talking to you. I'm starting to believe you miss me. Might as well come home. Why risk it? You know, we get along so well now. The charm of distance. Listen, I asked about this girl. Nobody has seen her. How much manpower am I supposed to put on this? How deep does this need to go? And I don't want you to hold a grudge. I know how you can get, and I don't want you to think I'm not taking this seriously. I believe you are taking it seriously. If I find her, do you need her dead or alive? Does it matter? Preferably alive. I'm asking you for the last time. What does that girl mean to you? I told you already. So, you're not gonna tell me what this is about?

[sighs] I'm feeling sentimental today. Okay, 12 months. We'll revisit the terms next year. ♪ ♪ Hey. She did it. ♪ ♪ Epifanio agreed to our terms. ♪ ♪ You don't seem pleased about that. I just don't think he would concede so easily. Well, maybe he's reaching out. Maybe it's his way of making peace. Or maybe he doesn't think I'm gonna be here next year. You know, this Mendoza girl? Keep an eye on her. I think she might be more useful than I thought. I want you to talk to her. You need to get her to trust you. Tell her, if she's thinking of running away, she shouldn't. If she's thinking of going to the police, they will send her to the ICE, and they'll ship her right back to Mexico. And sooner rather than later, my husband will find her. Tell her, if she wants to die, she should run. If she wants to live, she should stay with me. ♪ ♪ So, it looks like you're all settled in. Sweet dreams.
