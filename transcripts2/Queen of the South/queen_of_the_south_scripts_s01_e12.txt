 I want out. I can't be here anymore. 
 Is not about what you want, is it? 
 I killed a man because of you. 
 I'm just afraid the police will see that way. 
 Brenda : What is this? It doesn't make any sense. 
 Teresa : We need to figure out what it means. 
 You pay her, and you get that book. 
 They're dead... Eric, the bodyguards... they're all dead.

I know; I was married to one of those guys. El Limpiador, he's a money launderer. He probably has five times that amount lying around. And 250,000 is not enough money for us to disappear.

As a businessman in the private sector, I've had to stand up to these people. I have to fight with politicians whose cartel interests were more... more important than the interests of the Mexican people. Have I failed at times? Yes. But after yesterday's violence, I see only one more reason why I not only can but I must be the great leader the people of Sinaloa need and deserve. Vargas is for the people, and under Vargas, you and your children will be safe. Only I have the courage and the knowledge to end this violence, and I will. Thank you.
