 TERESA: Previously on Queen of the South... 
   CAMILA: Sinaloa has a right to know who you are. 
   EPI: What? 
   CAMILA: Isabela has a right to know about your hypocrisy. 
   -Where's Cole? 
  -Do I know you? 
   You know exactly who I am. 
   Teo did a good job of hiding your ownership  in shell corporations. 
   I'll give you 3 million for 100 keys. 
   If all goes well with my customers,  I'll take the rest of it and deliver 27 million. 
   How would you like to own my business? 
   I will sell it to you. 
   POTE: (speaking Spanish) 
   ALONZO: Teresa Mendoza. 
  This is Agent Loya. 
   Our offer's still on the table  if you choose to cooperate against Camila. 
   TERESA: Are you okay? 
  -Only if you have a gun. 
   (gunshots, man yelps) 
   (gun fires) 
   Look what we have here. 
   Camila Vargas, you're under arrest.

   ♪  (woman speaks indistinctly over PA) 
   What do you need me to do? 
   You're gonna cover for me. 
   Keep things status quo while I'm here. 
   Work alongside James. 
   Whatever you need, I'm ready. 
   CAMILA: Yes. 
  You are, Teresa. 
   You're here because of me. 
   I called the DEA agent. 
   You saved my life. 
   Again.

   ♪  I just made a deal. 
   You'll get extra protection in here. 
   You think we can trust them? 
   I mean, if we bought them, someone else can too. 
   Our guy in the Sheriff's Department trusts him  You'll be safe. 
   Cole said it's a bad search. 
   You'll be out in a couple days. 
   Until then, you and Teresa  will be working together, holding up things. 
   The priority is to assure our associates  that everything's well. 
   Excuse me. 
   TERESA: I'll be right back. 
   The minute I'm gone, you end up in here? 
   She's not ready, Camila. 
   I can handle the business alone. 
   If it wasn't for Teresa,  we wouldn't have anything worth protecting. 
   Hi. 
  Excuse me. 
   Where you from? 
   You got a lot of balls, coming at a stranger like that. 
   That woman I was talking to,  she comes from a very important family in Sinaloa. 
   Lil Traviesa. 
   Lil T. 
   Teresa Mendoza. 
   I have business to discuss. 
   So let us get to it. 
   I'm selling all my business to you, Boaz. 
   You'll have complete ownership. 
   Colonel Cortez will remain as your operational partner. 
   Reynaldo will keep the pipeline  with the product coming from Colombia. 
   And I will retain no supervisory nor veto power,  as long as it doesn't  interfere with my duties as governor. 
   What if your duties include stopping my business? 
   Our people rely on the cocaine production  for their survival. 
   I'm a pragmatist. 
   I have no desire to end that. 
   As long as you conduct yourself  as a proper businessman,  we have no issues. 
   REYNALDO: I'm sure Boaz understands  how profitable stability is  and will make a fine partner. 
   Being a cabrón is a choice. 
   But with all this money,  I'm sure I can be a nice guy. 
   (soft chuckling) 
   CORTEZ: I'm wondering, Governor,  when a great warrior decides to retire,  how long before he misses the thrill of the battle? 
   If he doesn't have the fight in him any longer,  never. 
   My family will be my priority, but... 
   I have one condition. 
   Camila is in jail, and her business will be crippled. 
   You did an excellent job, Colonel. 
   (brooding dramatic music) 
   You may continue going after her business,  but not her life. 
   Ever.

   Oh, it's nice of y'all to visit. 
   I thought Camila might have been  keeping you in the cage with her. 
   About that, she'll be out in 48 hours. 
   It's a bullshit charge. 
   Business is status quo. 
   Oh, status quo, huh? 
   What say you, princepesa? 
   I got your assurances on that? 
   Yeah.

   El Puño  was Boaz Jimenez's main enforcer. 
   I took care of him when you guys were down in La Paz. 
   This... 
   is payback. 
   (soft brooding music) 
   JAMES: We'll take care of it. 
   We'll get you more protection--  I don't give a rat's ass about your cocaine! 
   That's my boys down there! 
   We have commitments, payments to El Santo.

   We're gonna handle it. 
   GEORGE: You bet you are. 
   ♪  Why the DEA would blow their wad  on this mosquito-bite charge is beyond me. 
   It's textbook bad search. 
   They planted the gun  and a whole whopping eighth of an ounce of coke,  neither of which they can prove is yours. 
   It's laughable. 
   It's still a felony. 
   But you're a first-time offender. 
   You have 48 hours till your bail hearing,  and then you go free. 
   The prosecutor  will drop the indictment, and the DEA knows this. 
   This will crumble, Camila. 
   Have you spoken to your wife yet? 
   Not yet. 
   We have nothing to worry about with her. 
   (soft laugh) 
   She confronted me. 
   She knew where we were meeting, and when. 
   Somebody fed her that information. 
   Uh, Kelly Anne knows  what crossing me will get her. 
   I've got you covered. 
   ♪  Well, I didn't say your protection  would come without a cost. 
   I'm gonna need to think about this. 
   Keep looking for alternatives. 
   If the DEA does come up with something on your business  in the next 48 hours,  this... 
  is your only option. 
   I'm not a stupid woman. 
   I'm a Longhorn with a law degree. 
   And I live a lifestyle that most people would kill to have. 
   And you don't get those things by being a stupid woman. 
   Kelly Anne, what did you do? 
   (distant chatter) 
   Um. 
   I confronted Camila Vargas. 
   After you showed me that picture  of her and my husband. 
   And I--I followed him, and I waited. 
   And obvious--she-- she denied everything. 
   But then I went home and I saw on the news  they're just slaughtering people. 
   They're just slaughtering people like sheep. 
   And I don't know what the f*ck I'm supposed to do! 
   -It's okay. 
  Okay! 
  -What am I supposed to do--  Okay. 
  It's okay. 
   Take a seat. 
  It's okay. 
   You made a mistake. 
   (soft brooding music) 
   Now, I can protect you,  but I'm gonna need your help to do it. 
   Okay. 
   We're looking for a smoking gun. 
   Paperwork connecting Camila to Colibri Trawlers. 
   Your husband's firm handled the deal. 
   Everything about the company's ownership records  are buried offshore. 
   But Cole might still have those papers in his possession. 
   So you want me to search my house,  because then you won't need a warrant. 
   If you find those papers, we keep Camila behind bars. 
   Then we'll talk about how we keep you safe in the long run. 
   Okay? 
   (soft dramatic music) 
   Boaz hit us 'cause he thinks Camila's weak. 
   I'm gonna arrange a sit-down with him. 
   We broke him out of DEA custody last year, so  that should earn us enough good will. 
   Strike a truce. 
   I mean, we need a deal, not more bloodshed. 
   Pote took out his enforcer. 
   This is not about money. 
  It's personal. 
   It's always about money. 
   Till it isn't. 
   I think we should speak to Camila before--  There's no way. 
   So here's what's happening. 
   I'm gonna meet with him. 
   You're gonna sit tight. 
  And that's it. 
   (car chiming) 
   POTE: You don't need guns to sit tight. 
   I told Camila I wanted to be her partner. 
   She asked me to handle business while she was gone. 
   Are you with me? 
   Always the hard way. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   Claro que sí. 
   I'm sorry to interrupt your business. 
   It's not business. 
  This is pleasure. 
   I'm designing a home. 
   Architecture intrigues me. 
   I don't know much about it. 
   Oh, but you do. 
   The building is just like a business. 
   If the foundation is weak,  the structure will never be stable,  and eventually, everything will come tumbling down. 
   (soft brooding music) 
   Camila's charges are weak. 
   She'll be out in a couple of days. 
   This won't affect our business. 
   Except for the disruption of her distribution routes  through Corpus Christi. 
   Give me one good reason  I shouldn't back out of this right now. 
   This is a temporary situation. 
   It's being handled. 
   -By you? 
  -Yes. 
   The attack on our ships wasn't a setback. 
   It's an opportunity for both of us  to expand our business. 
   How so? 
   Guarantee me you won't stop distributing our product  and I'll tell you. 
   You asking me to close the deal  before you even pitched. 
   That's a rather bold move, Miss Mendoza. 
   It's not bold. 
   It's smart business,  for both of us. 
   My brother... 
   (horse nickers) 
   My brother used to love the horses. 
   Me? 
  Not so much. 
   (spits) 
  This place smells like sh1t. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   Given the situation at hand,  I thought it best not to add fuel to the fire. 
   You struck while Camila was in prison,  because you think she's vulnerable. 
   Let me assure you, she's not. 
   And yet the blood of a dozen dead mayates  taints the waters,  while I benefit from the fruits  of a deal you made with the madman, huh? 
   An attack on our transportation  is a direct attack on us. 
   And that warrants retaliation. 
   (clicks tongue) 
   But you're not here for that. 
   I'm here to save bloodshed on both sides. 
   (horse neighs) 
   And to make a deal which we can both benefit from. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   The moment that your buyers try our product,  they won't go back to yours. 
   We got the connect with El Santo. 
   And one stolen shipment's not changing that. 
   (soft dramatic music) 
   So what are you proposing? 
   We'll not expand into your territory in West Texas. 
   And you and Epifanio will cease any and all moves  against our business immediately. 
   That's your offer? 
   I get to keep what I already have? 
   If this lasts for 60 days,  no moves on either side,  we can negotiate a wholesale  for some of the Bolivian product.

   I have connections on the streets  that would take care of sales,  and muscle to back it up. 
   You got a street gang? 
   You've lined up infrastructure and some heat to protect it. 
   And with Las Sombras, we will have soldiers  in every single city in the Southwest.

   Set you up?

   What about the other paperwork in Camila's name? 
   That's to protect me. 
   See, you and I, we work for the same person. 
   And only one of us is stupid enough  to think that Camila  won't throw you to the wolves to save her own ass.

   Yes. 
   It's--it's a lot of excitement today. 
   But I'll have plenty of time to relax very soon. 
   You know,  I still cannot comprehend  how do you walk away from your life's work? 
   My life's work's my family.

   You are far too hard on yourself, compa. 
   You once called Camila  my weakness. 
   And you were correct, Colonel. 
   Had anyone else done the things that Camila did  on our so-called war,  the solution would have been obvious. 
   Get rid of her once and for all. 
   My heart didn't let me do this. 
   But apparently your sicarios in Dallas  had no such obstacle. 
   The word I received is that they tried to  take her life.
