 TERESA: Previously on "Queen of the South"... 
   I deal in nothing less than metric tons. 
   We'll take the ton. 
   EL SANTO: I shall expect the first payment within the week. 
   -(giggles) 
  -This is my wife, Kelly Anne. 
   Hi. 
   CAMILA: I need you to do something for me. 
   Camila Vargas is a cold-blooded criminal. 
   GARRETT: She'll get word soon that we're here  and now we come for whatever she's got left. 
   (gunshot) 
  Ah. 
   Where's my mom? 
   There's something I couldn't tell you over the phone.

   I'm so proud of you.

   I do. 
   And do you understand that if we don't  get that first payment, a fleet of El Santo's hit men  are gonna be on the next flight to Dallas. 
   El Santo gave us no choice. 
   I don't remember asking you a damn thing. 
   TERESA: He said take a metric ton or nothing. 
   I understand it put us in danger. 
   So why'd you do it? 
   Because now you have a choice. 
   With nothing, you don't. 
   It was a gamble. 
  I made it alone.

   Why is he still alive? 
   He saved my life when he didn't have to.

   You're making judgment calls now? 
   Teresa makes 'em, you pat her on the back. 
   I make 'em, I'm insubordinate. 
   She did exactly what I asked her to do and more.

   That was before Bolivia. 
   She's happy with what we've done. 
   No, she's happy with you.

   CAMILA: Epifanio. 
   Isabela received a necklace with El Santo's logo on it. 
   Now, she has no clue what it is, but we do. 
   Why is El Santo threatening our daughter, Camila? 
   El Santo's my new supplier now. 
   I have a payment due to him in a week,  so I guess the necklace is a reminder. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   You went into business with this religious lunatic? 
   You destroyed everyone I did business with  then left me nearly with nothing. 
   You really think I was not going to rebuild? 
   She's our child, Camila. 
   Listen, how much is the payment to this man? 
   $3 million.

   Then I'm gonna take the coke you got from them,  move it myself, and pay off that psychotic zealot.

   You don't get to tell me how I earn. 
   EPIFANIO: When your earning  threatens the life of my daughter,  you're God damn right I do.

   All my friends at my new school wanna play it. 
   I'm glad. 
  Listen, I have to go. 
   I love you, okay? 
   Don't let those bad guys get you. 
   I won't.

   Well, at $2,000 a bottle, it should be. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   ♪ I remember that first time Epifanio and I  could afford a bottle like this. 
   You think it's a better drink. 
   But then you realize, it's a better life. 
   ♪ Epifanio's distributors are ripe to be lured back in  for two reasons. 
   First, we have a superior product. 
   CAMILA: It's what coke was in the '80s. 
   No adulterants, incredible euphoria,  absolutely no come down. 
   -And second-- -They can't get product  because we blew up Epifanio's tunnel. 
   Good.

   400 kilos a week. 
   He looks like a kindly grandfather,  but don't let that fool you. 
   ♪ He came up in the Korean mob,  deadly and ruthless. 
   ♪ This is how you turn $1 million a month  into $5 million a week,  if we succeed.

   This is your father. 
  (lifts, drops receiver) 
   Does she think that I don't know she's with  that pinche Kique Jimenez? 
   You have more pressing family issues. 
   We just received word from our Dallas distributors:  Camila is trying to steal them back. 
   She's got meetings set up already. 
   One is with our Southwest U.S. 
  distributors, Ki-Moon. 
   I offered to pull her out of the fire with El Santo  with my money, and she does this. 
   (chuckles) 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   Anyone who meets with her is declaring their betrayal to me. 
   It should be dealt with accordingly. 
   She's just going to keep going. 
   Your wife put your daughter in danger. 
   Compa, isn't it time  that we put an end to her right now? 
   (dark music) 
   No.

   But don't touch my wife.

   She is respectful. 
   She is. 
   So the merchandise is of the highest quality, Mr. 
  Kim. 
   And unlike Epifanio's product,  it can be delivered to you today. 
   I was assured that Epifanio's delivery issue  will resolve itself shortly. 
   No, his delay's costing you millions of dollars. 
   And he's charging you 30,000 a kilo. 
   You can get ours today at 25,000. 
   You'd be getting a better product  for half a million dollars less. 
   And at what price does loyalty become for sale? 
   All this talk about money. 
   I apologize profusely. 
   Teresa's young. 
  I have high hopes for her. 
   It's difficult to teach this business to those whom you love. 
   My own son, Ki-Wan... 
  (laughs) 
  (speaks Korean) 
   My wife and I worry. 
   Well, you're fortunate to have the relationship  you have with your son. 
   I'm ashamed to admit that Epifanio  is attempting to separate me from my own daughter. 
   Sung-Shil will be saddened to hear. 
   In the midst of your own family turmoil,  you invite into your home. 
   -I am honored. 
  -And I am honored to know  that even if you came to say no to me,  you're still open enough to bring your taster. 
   His palate is without question. 
   And I'm sure he'll find our product unlike anything  you can find available anywhere.

   Almost everything, anyways. 
   You trying to make me regret that? 
   I don't know, man. 
  I'm grateful. 
   I just--I don't know if Camila feels the same way. 
   La Paz was one thing. 
   You're gonna have to prove yourself in Dallas. 
   You're gonna meet a guy--Delaney. 
   He's gonna sell you some equipment we need. 
   Why me? 
   If Camila knew I let a snitch watch her stash,  she'd kill us both. 
   Take the truck out front. 
   Watch yourself. 
   Will do. 
   CAMILA: After the little stunt Epifanio pulled on us,  I need to send a message. 
   Well, I'll do what I can,  but I don't usually handle divorce settlements. 
   Well, I don't trust anybody else digging about my business. 
   Can I count on you to protect my interests? 
   That you can. 
  Absolutely.

   You know, family is everything to Ki-Moon. 
   I knew you were gonna use money to lure him in.

   Both local-- (TV clicks off) 
   Epifanio did this. 
   And then he tried to have us killed. 
   I never thought it would come to this. 
   You saved my life. 
   Thank you. 
   You're welcome. 
   So...let Guero live. 
   $3 million, courtesy of Epifanio Vargas for our payment  to El Santo. 
   Epifanio's gonna be contacting you  to arrange the pick-up of the coke. 
   That should be an enjoyable phone call. 
   I'm gonna need a minute. 
   Come on. 
   Denny's contact at the Dallas P.D. 
   said he was almost caught today. 
   JAMES: So the cops know he's in town. 
   You were right. 
   I should've taken care of it in Bolivia. 
   JAMES: He can't stay here. 
   I'm not ready to make that decision yet. 
   We first have to move the product. 
   You're not giving it to Epifanio. 
   JAMES: We have another payment to El Santo in a week. 
   (sighs) 
   (dark music) 
   He threatened your daughter. 
   You were right about Guero, now you're second guessing it. 
   I don't know where this is coming from, Camila,  but this isn't like you. 
   -This is messy. 
  -Well then I clean it up  like I always do. 
   Get that filthy money out of here. 
   ♪ Hi. 
   Your friends are really nice. 
   Yeah, Deborah pisses on her husband. 
   -What? 
  -Yeah, I know. 
   Well, Roger wasn't getting it up anymore,  so they decided to try a little something new  and it actually worked for a little while. 
   The only problem is now when Debbie goes into  a public restroom, she kinda gags a little bit. 
   (laughs) 
   And you see Misty over there? 
  She's been having an affair  with her husband's partner for the last three years. 
   And then Tina, she ran up a hundred grand  on her husband's AmEx card last month. 
   Doesn't know she's about to be cut off. 
   We all kinda gave up our lives for the fairy tale,  but the thing is, the fairy tale is bullshit. 
   Why are you telling me all of this? 
   I'm a notorious over-sharer. 
   I just wanted you to know that we ain't perfect. 
   There's a lot of skeletons in these walk-in closets. 
   What's yours? 
   My skeleton? 
   How much time do you have? 
   (laughs) 
   I think your boss, Camila, is sleeping with my husband. 
   So that's why you asked me here? 
   I know the position that puts you in. 
   She's your boss. 
   But I hope, as a woman, you understand  the position that puts me in. 
   Yeah, of course. 
   (dark music) 
   Is it true? 
   Camila's happily married. 
   She wouldn't do that.

   Epifanio, hello. 
  (phone beeps) 
   I trust you have received the money I sent for your payment. 
   EPIFANIO: We need to make arrangements for me to pick up  El Santo's product. 
   Yes, thank you so much for the payment.

   Bristol dropped by 16, check on that pharma short with Stu. 
   $250,000 buy me a hello but not a meeting. 
   If you're looking to invest,  I'm afraid my broker days are over. 
   But I can refer some people. 
   CAMILA: Stock is not a stable commodity. 
   But I believe a private jet company is. 
   My company's not for sale, and I'm not looking for a partner. 
   If you're looking to buy in aviation, I'd suggest Delta.
