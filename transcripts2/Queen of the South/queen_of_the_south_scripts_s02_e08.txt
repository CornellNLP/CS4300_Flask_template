 JAMES: Previously on "Queen of the South"... 
   I never had a first anniversary before. 
   I love you. 
   LOYA: Guero's dead. 
   Aah! 
  Uh! 
   I deal in nothing less than metric tons. 
   We'll take the ton. 
   There's no way we can distribute this amount. 
   If we don't get that first payment,  a fleet of El Santo's hit men  are gonna be on the next flight to Dallas. 
   I understand I put us in danger. 
   Devon Finch gets a hundred offers a day. 
   CAMILA: I'm not interested in investing  in Finch's companies. 
   I'm interested in distribution  and money laundering through them. 
   Today we announce the formation  of a joint U.S. 
 -Mexico drug task force.

   ♪ Feliz cumpleaños, a la jefa. 
   Gracias, Pote. 
  It's a beautiful cake. 
   Thank you. 
   -Salud. 
  ALL: Salud. 
   This lovely gift from my family  and not a single word from my only daughter. 
   I hope you enjoy your decorative spoons. 
   Beautiful, Pote. 
  Well done. 
   Your lawyer didn't forget you. 
   It's beautiful. 
   I still have to receive the only present that I need. 
   Devon Finch. 
   He's not gonna work with us. 
   Then we're gonna have to twist his hand, don't we? 
   We need his transpo, he needs our product. 
   He just doesn't know it yet. 
   All of you are going to Chicago. 
   You're gonna spread El Santo's dust on the streets. 
   And I can guarantee you that once his clients  -get a taste for it-- -They'll come to us. 
   CAMILA: And so will Devon. 
   He thinks his business is untouchable. 
   We're gonna show him it's not. 
   You're gonna find his Tastemaker  and make him buy from us. 
   And if he doesn't, then what? 
   Then we're just gonna have to strike. 
   Spreading coke on his territory is one thing. 
   An outright attack on his operation... 
   that's just asking for trouble. 
   I never had to ask you twice to do something. 
   Today is not the day to start, James. 
   I'm going to need intel on his jet  before we can move on. 
   Can you handle it?

   He's trying to shut you down. 
   Or plan another attack. 
   Either way, it's crucial that this works. 
   Come. 
   Devon's Tastemaker throws a party for his customers  every week at Chicago's best hotel. 
   I need you to get him to try our product  while James works on the other customers,  the high rollers who play poker at the party. 
   Once Devon grants us a proper meeting,  You, Pote, and James can come back home. 
   Guero won't be joining you. 
   I need him to go to Chicago  to research Devon's planes. 
   But after that, either you cut him off  or I will.

   TRUESDALE: Gentlemen, this is day one of our joint task force. 
   Colonel Cortez's agents have been briefed  and Governor Vargas is dealing with the press. 
   Camila Vargas is in business with a Bolivian supplier  named El Santo. 
   If you do not stop her,  there will be more bloodshed. 
   The Bolivian product has shown up in Dallas. 
   And we also made a seizure tied to a trawler company  we believe Camila owns, Colibri Transport. 
   The company's owned by a shell corporation. 
   We need papers to prove Camila's the owner,  but we connect those dots, we got her dead to rights. 
   I've been watching their drop-offs. 
   Most of 'em come here every other day  from Devon's jets for distribution. 
   They use his hotels for the other drops.

   GUERO: Give or take 15 minutes. 
   They change up the transpo to look legit, though. 
   Laundry trucks, kitchen supplies.

   ♪ If I'm still standing here when Camila comes out,  I'm a dead man. 
   And if you're still standing here--  She will hunt us both. 
   That's not what's gonna happen.

   Pote's here for you till I get back. 
   You can count on him. 
   Hey. 
   I'll be back soon, all right? 
   I promise. 
   (gentle, somber music) 
   ♪ I love you.
