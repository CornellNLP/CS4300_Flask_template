 TERESA: Previously on "Queen of the South"... 
   EL SANTO: Now you are one of us. 
   I shall expect the payment for the metric ton  within the week. 
   My life is on the line with El Santo. 
   Not yours or Camila. 
   Look what we have here. 
   Camila Vargas, you're under arrest. 
   You walk out of here and never come back. 
   Princesa's dad is gonna kick me to the curb like basura. 
   (laughs) 
   Apparently your sicarios in Dallas  tried to take Camila's life. 
   (gunshot) 
   (gunfire) 
   The priority is to assure our associates  that everything's well. 
   Give me one good reason I shouldn't back out of this  right now. 
   It's an opportunity for both of us  to expand our business. 
   Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale. 
   You got a street gang. 
   -Lil T. 
  -Teresa Mendoza. 
   These are the ownership documents  filed for Camila's Trawler company. 
   TERESA: I never signed these papers. 
   -If she puts up a fight... 
  -Then kill her. 
   (gunfire) 
   (screams) 
   TERESA: In the morning, we're gonna go back to Dallas  and take what's rightfully mine. 
   (goat bleats) 
   EL SANTO: (chanting) 
   (shouts) 
   (somber music) 
   (children speaking Spanish) 
   EL SANTO: (singing) 
   Teresa Mendoza... 
  Teresa Mendoza... 
   Teresa Mendoza. 
   (chanting continues) 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   ♪  TERESA: I brought the two of you together for a reason. 
   Thank you for allowing us to meet here. 
   You know, I heard legends about you for years. 
   Kid burst up outta nowhere like a goddamn Roman Candle. 
   Carvin' out an empire with nothin' but his big-sized-brain  and certain amount of elegant violence. 
   I'll admit, I was curious to meet you as well. 
   You disappeared a competitor of mine out of South Africa  a few years ago,  as I came to deliver  a bit of "elegant violence."  I'd love to hear how you did that... 
   after Ms. 
  Mendoza tells us what's on her mind. 
   I'm leaving Camila. 
   Starting off on my own. 
   I would like to keep working with both of you. 
   She ain't exactly one for flowery speeches, huh? 
   No, she's not. 
   Nothing has to change. 
  The deal remains the same. 
   Big britches you're trying to fill, girl. 
   There ain't no trial run on this. 
   I know the risks. 
   DEVON: But do you know the consequences? 
   If you do succeed,  you will be responsible for more than just your own life. 
   The burdens of leadership are not small. 
   I understand that. 
   And I understand the business up to this point  has been unstable. 
   Profits will continue, but the drama will end. 
   What's your POV on this, Chewy? 
   Everyone has a right to the throne. 
   If they can take it. 
   Fortunately for you, the appetite  for your Bolivian connection  seems unquenchable. 
   As long as you have El Santo's product,  you have me. 
   I have it. 
  The deal remains the same. 
   I'll sell it to you, and no one else. 
   You'll receive details for the pickup and delivery tomorrow. 
   Thank you. 
   I can feel your eyeballs on me. 
   (chuckles) 
   You haven't given me your answer. 
   It ain't what you're looking to hear, baby girl. 
   I'ma have to think on it. 
   Took heavy losses when that Jimenez fellow  disrupted our shipment. 
   Thinking maybe smuggling guns and ganja  might be just enough for little ol' me. 
   You know the profit on guns--  Don't you try and math me. 
   That gun goes for 50K right there. 
   And that's just one. 
   You think this is about money, girl? 
   I'm truly sorry for your loss. 
   Me too. 
   And I'd like to keep my boys  fat and happy. 
   And a whole lot less dead. 
   You're making promises that you cannot back up  to dangerous men, Teresita. 
   That's how you get killed. 
   If I don't pay El Santo, I'm dead. 
   Camila has the cash and the coke. 
   You got nothing. 
   That's why we need to get it. 
   Camila's facing federal charges. 
   They're gonna have to move the coke out of the country  as soon as possible. 
   We must steal it back before they do. 
   Oh! 
   You want to rob Camila Vargas? 
   I need that product. 
   Not only to pay El Santo. 
   It means freedom. 
   It's only you and me. 
   We don't have the muscle to go against James  or Camila's men. 
   That's why we can't do it alone. 
   (foreboding music) 
   ♪  CAMILA: Teresa was a stray mutt  when I met her. 
   I brought her into our family,  let her sleep under my roof... 
   Well, what did you expect  after she called the DEA to "save" you? 
   Once someone's in bed with the feds,  you can't ever trust them. 
   You tried to warn me. 
   I should've listened. 
   I opened my arms to that girl  and she spit in my face. 
   Let her die in the cold with the other dogs. 
   Sometimes dogs try to return home  even after the door is closed. 
   Well then, make sure there's no food in the house. 
   Do you understand? 
   And James... 
   they're transferring me tonight to a maximum security facility. 
   I heard it's gonna be a beautiful evening. 
   I want to see the sky. 
   (Spanish rap) 
   ♪  LIL T: That's my uncle. 
   He's our leader. 
   Took a .22 three times to the back, point blank. 
   Pow pow pow. 
   My uncle took that puto out with his bare hands,  crawlin' around like a pinche salamander and sh1t. 
   He ain't nothing to f*ck with. 
   That dude over there eyeballing us... 
   That's Chucho. 
   That's my uncle's number two. 
   Stop! 
   (music stops) 
   Who the hell are you? 
   You ain't welcome here. 
   You said you spoke with him. 
   Figured it was better in person. 
   -Tio, this is-- -I'm not talking to you. 
   (tense music) 
   ♪  I'm here to talk about business. 
   Wrong place, wrong time, Esa. 
   I heard you're a businessman. 
   I'm looking for a partner. 
   Go home, business lady. 
   I'm not leaving here without talking to you. 
   And you're gonna listen. 
   The f*ck you just say to me? 
   You can either turn around and leave  or die standing here. 
   ♪  Yo, what the hell, are you stupid? 
   Do you know who this is, fool? 
   I don't give a f*ck who this is! 
   He's a Vargas sicario. 
   I'm not here for a fight. 
   I'm here to make a deal. 
   My name's Teresa Mendoza. 
   I think we can help each other. 
   How come you ain't talking to Los Treintas? 
   Last time I checked, you got those pussies running for you. 
   Los Treintas works with Epifanio. 
   You working for Camila? 
   I was. 
   But I'm on my own now. 
   She has something of mine. 
   I need help taking it back. 
   -What? 
  -Cocaine. 
   Going up against the cartel is serious sh1t. 
   What you offering? 
   The Vargas and Jimenez Cartel consolidated  in one cartel. 
   Your enemies are united. 
   You're gonna need real firepower to protect your people. 
   I have something that you need. 
   -Guns. 
  -And product. 
   Work with us, we arm your men  for the fight you know is coming. 
   Plus, you get 10% of the profit  of the product that you help us get back. 
   -We get the guns first? 
  -Yes. 
   You got balls. 
   But if this sh1t is true, then... 
   the enemy of my enemy is my homie, right? 
   That's some serious cash you're offering for a little muscle. 
   TERESA: I believe in a fair deal. 
   All right. 
   You get us the guns... 
   we'll help you get your coke. 
   (dramatic music) 
   ♪  I told you, I don't want to hear anymore about it, Isabela. 
   Papi, she needs our help. 
  Please. 
   You may think you know your mother, Bela,  but I know that woman better than you should ever hope to. 
   You want her to bend, to change,  but she's made of the hardest steel, my love. 
   We will break before she does. 
   And I won't watch that happen to you. 
   She's better right where she is. 
   You had me fooled, Papi. 
   You told me what you went through as a kid. 
   I thought that kind of struggle makes someone's heart bigger. 
   But you're a small man. 
   How dare you talk to me like that?! 
   You never struggled one day in your life. 
   -I saw to that. 
  -You don't think I struggle? 
   You don't think I'm in there with her? 
   That she didn't leave me too? 
  Are you that blind? 
   -Isabela! 
  -Don't. 
   I'm staying with Olivia at her family's ranch,  and I'm not coming home until Mom does too. 
   - Well, enjoy your stay. 
  Like mother, like daughter! 
   Spoiled and pigheaded! 
   I gave you that beautiful life, Bela! 
   And it can all be taken away! 
   Just ask your mother! 
   I need guns, and I need them fast. 
   (laughs) 
   Something tells me you ain't taking up skeet shootin'. 
   It's business. 
   (chuckles) 
   My daddy killed all these animals. 
   Every single one. 
   Even Timothy here. 
   What kind of man kills a goddamn beaver? 
   I don't know. 
   Not a happy one. 
   I'll tell you that much. 
   He died sad, alone, and empty. 
   And rich as sh1t. 
   I'm not doing this to get rich. 
   That's a story a lot of people tell themselves at first. 
   How about this-- I got an open slot on my crew. 
   Been a while since we had a squaw in our tribe. 
   You could be my Pocahontas. 
   (laughs) 
  Or maybe I'll be your Pocahontas. 
   We could figure that out along the way. 
   Thank you. 
   But we both know I have to do this. 
   What's in it for you, really? 
   Is it revenge? 
  That's what you want? 
   There's a better way of doing business  than the way Camila does. 
   And I know you believe that too. 
   (sighs thoughtfully) 
   (somber music) 
   ♪  I delivered a small arsenal  to a backwards-ass group of skinheads about a week ago. 
   Dudes were sketchy as sh1t. 
   Big plans, little brains. 
   Plus they insulted Bilal, so f*ck 'em. 
   But don't you let one of those hillbillies kill you, girl. 
   'Cause we got an empire to build. 
   JAMES: A friend will be giving you a gift  The moon's gonna be full at 8:00 tonight. 
   8:00 p.m. 
  That's beautiful. 
   I hope I get to see it. 
   I'll be looking for a window. 
   Talk soon. 
   (intercom blaring) 
   All right, Camila's our priority. 
   We move at 8:00. 
   All this product and cash, it can stay for now. 
   But I want our best men on guard, 24/7. 
   I'm gonna check to make sure everything's in position. 
   TERESA: The coke and cash from Devon's first payment  is at the warehouse. 
   But security's doubled. 
   Okay, we have some time now. 
   We need to get to the location George gave me. 
   James' man won't move the product without him there. 
   But we don't know how long he'll be gone. 
   We have no choice. 
   Once I get the guns to Big T,  we'll have the muscle we need. 
   You're giving guns to thugs. 
   That's a stupid decision, Teresita. 
   Trust needs to be earned. 
   I didn't have to trust you, but I did. 
   And if you hadn't sent Guero away,  we would have someone better helping us. 
   You thought I didn't know. 
   Guero and I were planning to escape. 
   Then you talked to him. 
   He needed to go. 
   That wasn't your decision to make. 
   I was trying to keep you safe. 
   If I don't do this,  El Santo will kill me. 
   You should know better than making a deal with a psychopath. 
   Would you question Camila like this? 
   You are no Camila. 
   Look, if you're not gonna help me,  please leave. 
   I'll take care of myself.

   What about James and his men? 
   They're gone. 
   You won. 
   The coke is yours. 
   Just go. 
   OLIVIA: Why isn't Pedro letting us leave? 
   It's been hours. 
   We can't just sit here and wait  until they decided whether or not they're gonna kill us. 
   Kill us? 
   I didn't do anything. 
   Hey, shh, shh, shh. 
   I think he's leaving. 
   Isabela, Olivia, we have to go! 
   No! 
  If they catch you, they'll kill us! 
   -Look at the window. 
  -Bela, don't! 
   (overlapping speech) 
   They're escaping! 
   (indistinct shouting) 
   No! 
  Stop it! 
   -No! 
  -Leave me alone! 
   Ahh. 
  You in love with this pretty boy, Princesa? 
   No! 
  No! 
   You monster. 
   PEDRO: I'm a monster? 
   This pendejo's dad killed my dad. 
   Took everything from us. 
   stole my father, stole my life. 
   Stole all of our lives. 
   You're a liar! 
   (groans) 
   PEDRO: You let your father cut me off. 
   I'll never forgive you for that. 
   Now me and my family are gonna receive $5 million,  or I'm going to cut both your throats. 
   You know my dad won't pay a dime for me, Pedro! 
   Who said anything about Boaz paying? 
   Epifanio gave the order. 
   But maybe money ain't quite sweet enough revenge. 
   No, no, no, cabron! 
  Don't touch her, Pedro! 
   (screams) 
  We're family! 
   We grew up together! 
  Please! 
   (gasping) 
   Pedro... 
   you only want them. 
   Can I please just go? 
   KIQUE: This isn't you, man. 
   Please, Pedro. 
   (gunshot) 
   Olivia, no! 
   (gasping) 
   No, no... 
   Product is all here, but... 
   we couldn't find any money anywhere. 
   James must have stashed it somewhere else. 
   It's okay. 
  Just take it to the drop-off on time. 
   Everyone gets paid. 
   Orale. 
   POTE: I told you. 
   You're no Camila. 
   And I meant it. 
   You're better. 
   You got a heart. 
   You got something to say, Princesa? 
   You stupid, pathetic wannabe gangster. 
   You think my father ruined your life? 
   I hate him more than you can ever hope to. 
   I'm not gonna ask him for five million. 
   I'm gonna ask him for ten. 
   Kique and I get two  and you and your cousins get eight, and we go free. 
   You want revenge? 
   Be a man and do it yourself. 
   You think you got leverage, bitch? 
   I'll kill you right now. 
   And you don't get nothing. 
   -Put me on tape. 
  -You think I'm stupid? 
   My father won't pay you anything unless he sees me alive. 
   Put me on tape, I'll get you your ten million. 
   Then Kique and I go free. 
   (tense music) 
   ♪  FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Breaking news from Dallas. 
   Federal authorities are reporting  that accused cartel leader Camila Vargas  was apparently broken out of custody  while en route to a high security facility last night. 
   For more on this story, we turn to our reporter--  (breathing heavily) 
   I thought you sent Cortez to do your dirty work. 
   And here you are. 
   Bravo, mi amor. 
   Face to face in the end. 
   Just like the man I always knew you were. 
   I didn't break you out of prison to hurt you, Camila. 
   Your daughter begged for your life. 
   I wanted to bring you home to her. 
   But now I have some, ah... 
   some terrible news. 
   Isabela. 
   She told me she was going to Oliva's family's house. 
   A few hours ago, I received this video. 
   Mami, Papi,  I'm in trouble. 
   I've been kidnapped. 
   I haven't been this scared since I turned eight. 
   CAMILA: We have to find her. 
   EPIFANIO: If we attack, they'll kill her. 
   (sniffs) 
   They will pay for this. 
   Devon will pay $27 million  for the other 900 kilos. 
   Then we can pay El Santo  and live another day. 
   And you're gonna trust the delivery  to a bunch of street thugs? 
   We have no choice. 
   He uses separate locations for product delivery  and money drop-off. 
   I need to be on the money side. 
   You could've gone, to keep an eye on the product. 
   You have too many enemies tonight. 
   Where you go, I go. 
   Thank you. 
   (tires screech) 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   (ominous music) 
   ♪  El Santo found me. 
   I'm late with his payment. 
   No weapons. 
   I'm one of them.
