 Woman : Previously on  Queen of the South: Everyone seems to be messing with my business. 
 We're late with everyone. No one has their shipments. 
 Teresa. 
 Yeah, hi. 
 When you first came into our church,  you mentioned you needed to get back to Mexico to retrieve something of value. I might be able to get you there. 
 You're making a mistake, Allen. 
 Allen : It's one time. 
 You are my supplier, not Eric. 
 Get me my money or I'm cutting you off. 
 Camila : You have proven you can be relied upon to do what I need. 
 Turning to $2 1/2 million into five. It's not an easy trick. (gunshot) ♪ ♪ Just do what I say and nothing will happen to you. (gunfire) Teresa : I know you're scared.

(groaning) Stay with me, man. Stay with me. (suspenseful music) How's he doing? He's not good, man. Where's the doctor? Not here yet. I can see that, genius. Camila says he's on his way.

I think in the back. It's okay. I know how hard this was for you. I know. But do you really think you could have gotten out of that hotel room without doing what you did? No. So it's not like you had a choice, right? That  cabrón  was going to kill you. And he wouldn't have blinked or shed a tear. Life is for the living. Now pull yourself together. We still have work to do. Television announcer : Three people are dead following a shootout and a horrific accident on Interstate 30 today. The incident may have involved rival gangs and drug cartels. Give me the info you got on the maid. The maid in the room. She won't say anything. She was scared. This isn't a robbery anymore, Teresa. It's a murder investigation. The cops, they tend to lose their sense of humor at this point. We can't be tied to this. She's the only one who saw your face. I didn't get her name. I specifically said take a picture of her ID. She was scared. I threatened her. So you didn't get it. I didn't get her name. Why? That's the first thing I told you. I threatened her. She was scared. I didn't get her name. Camila : Enough. You know what's done is done. Call Denny at the sheriff's office. He'll track her address for us. That's what he's paid for. (phone vibrates) Doctor's here. James : Denny, it's me. I know it. I know, it's a shitstorm. Look, there's a maid who's a witness. Is she saying anything? Well, I wish she didn't say anything, but it's the way it is. I need her address. It's not coming from me. It's Camila. So don't say sh1t about it. Just get it done. Doctor : How long ago was he shot? The charger : Coming up on 40 minutes. Doctor : All right. Get his legs down flat. Don't elevate the legs. Not with a torso wound. Okay, we're gonna have to turn him over. Check for exit wounds. Okay. All right, move the towels out of the way. Get ready to roll him over. Everybody ready. On three. Ready? One, two, three. (Tonto groans) Easy. One, two... There's no third exit wound. Flaco : What does that mean? Doctor : It means the third bullet's still in here. We need to lay him back down. Come on, come on, easy. sh1t. Hey! We need a hand over here. You! Come on.

They're all dead! What? James, you don't know this? Is that what you're telling me? Look, Leon, you just woke me up, man. You're coming at me with sh1t I can't digest. Just back up a sec. Leon : My brothers got hit, do you understand me? They're gone, James. They're dead. All right, listen to me. This has nothing to do with me or the people I work for. We met, I got the dope, they got the cash, end of story. Uh-huh, not end of story, James. This is a mess. Turn on the damn news. All right. Look, Leon, let me make some calls. I'll get back to you as soon as I got something, okay? Leon : I'm on a plane. When I land, I want answers. Seems like they got a brother. He's flying in. He's on his way. It sounds like trouble. I'll think of something. One bird at a time. Find that maid. How is he? It's a wait-and-see thing. What, you want to take a chance and drop him off at emergency? You know we can't do that.

You got everything? Yeah. Okay. (phone ringing) Hello? Brenda, it's me. I'm in trouble, okay? I need your help. Teresita, what's wrong? I just need your help, okay? Okay. What's happening? (door chimes) It's early. (gun cocks) Camila. You had me a little nervous there. We're actually a bit late. Usual drop time is 2:00, right? Yeah. Camila : I wanted to deliver it personally. I thought you were dry. And I thought you were listening. I told you it was a temporary thing. Consider everything back to normal. 100 total. You got the door? (inhales sharply) Holy sh1t, that's nice. That's really nice. So, uh, so you're back. I never left. Was just a rumor. There's just one problem. Oh, yeah? And what is that? (engine idles) (engine shuts off) (door chimes) What's the matter? Not who you expected? Don't you belong in North Texas? You don't belong here. Person can get in trouble in my territory. ♪ ♪ I know you're not authorized to take me out. You're not. I mean, even you're smarter than that. What are you doing here? What's in the bag? Just a little something to help out a friend. He doesn't want your help. Allen. Yo! Allen. Get your ass out here. Camila just told me you don't want my coke. I told you, it was just temporary. Why you telling Allen you can get him sh1t when you know damn well you can't? She just delivered. Camila : Look at your little birdbrain doing these little birdbrain calculations. You see, Eric, there's things you know and there's things you don't know, and then there's things you don't even know you don't know. Eric : So that's it? You got your answer. Go back to North Texas. I'll see you around, Allen. You're betting on the wrong horse. (door chimes) Camila : Don't worry about him. He gives you trouble, just call me. Denny. Name's Maria Sanchez. That's her home address. Listen, you really took a dump on this, you know that? We're getting way too much attention. I know. Four dead bodies. Department's buzzing. The deal was, you're not supposed to make us look bad. Let's call it rare occurrence. I appreciate the favor. So does Camila. (phone vibrating) ♪ ♪ Yeah. Leon : Yo, James. It's Leon. Just landed. Want to see you. Yeah, I'm thinking the same.

Mom, who is she? What do I do? We are not like them. Let her go. Let her go, Angel. Let her go. Why are you here? What do you want? There are people coming for you, okay? I tell the police nothing. I say nothing. I believe you, okay? But all these people care about is that you're not a threat to them. You're a witness. You saw my face. But I want to help you. We cannot waste time. Listen to me, they're on their way. We have to go. Go where? You said you have family in Durango, right? Are they still there? My father, my uncle. We are going to the police. No, you can't. This people, own the police. Listen to me. Does anyone here know you have family in Durango? No. Okay. Then you have to go back to Durango. If you stay here, they will find you and your son. (sobs) We didn't do anything. I know. That's why I'm here. How long? How long do we have to hide there? You can never come back. I left there to get away from all of this. I have built a life for my son. ♪ ♪ You're wasting time. I'm sorry to hear about what happened. Me too. Me too. I'm sure you could imagine. Yeah. So let's talk about my brothers.

What do you know about the Jimenez cartel? They run half of Texas. We have the other half. Why? Got a text from my brother yesterday. Okay. He said someone from the Jimenez cartel threatened him at the hotel bar. He told you that? He didn't tell you? No. No, he did not, because if he did, I would have warned him. A threat like that is not a joke. The guy said to be careful dealing in Texas. Told him to go home. Did he say what the guy looked like? No. Well, then how does he know it was Jimenez? I don't know, James, that's just what he said. Why? You doubt it? I don't know what I think, man. It could be Jimenez. Do we have problems with them? Sure. But maybe it's just some jokers pretending to be Jimenez. Look, let me call my boss. We need to figure things out. There was a maid. Might be able to identify somebody. You know about that? How'd you hear about that? I heard about it. I'll check on the maid too. But look, it's not gonna be easy. There's a lot of heat on this. I'll give you a beat, then I take things into my own hands. You won't have to. I promise. We'll figure this out. ♪ ♪ (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (indistinct conversation) Man : No, I'm telling you. That's how much you're supposed to pay.

Look, she didn't show up to work. We're just worried. You know when she's gonna be back? She mentioned she's running errands. Maybe a couple hours. All right, thank you. Jesus. Come on, Annabelle.

Everything I owe you. ♪ ♪ You know, Camila, I have to be honest with you. I didn't think that you were going to be able to make your payment. See, Jaime, all my life, men have underestimated me. I've grown used to it. See, most men are very basic creatures. They can't seem to see beyond my legs. So sometimes I use that to my advantage and others, I just depend upon it. Anyway, now that my debt is settled I assume our mutual trust is restored? And most important, my credit, separate from Epifanio's. Absolutely. And you're forgiven for being late on your payment. Good. And you're forgiven for letting my husband know about our arrangement and trying to undermine my business. You see, I know everything. I know he's the one's that's been putting the works on me all this time. I know he's the one that arranged the shipment from you to be busted, putting me in this mess. Just as I know he empowered Eric and the Jimenez cartel to put a move on me. So I know everything. It's okay. You can speak freely. Who told you? I had my suspicions. Call it an instinct. And you just confirmed it. I'm not angry, Jaime. I understand this wasn't personal. I know that your business with Epifanio is more valuable than mine. But not for long. I'm going to increase my business, so starting next month, I want to double my shipment from you. We have no objection to that, of course. But we know that Epifanio keeps a tight rein on things in Texas. He might object. No, he won't. How can you be so sure? He won't have a choice. ♪ ♪ James. Where are we with the maid? I'm still waiting on Denny. Should be soon, though. James : But this Leon guy, the brother? This gold-tooth b*st*rd? He's trouble. You know, even if we take care of the maid, I'm telling you, this guy's not gonna stop until he's got blood on his hands. Tell him I want to meet with him. You want to meet with him? Why? Just set up a meet. I have an idea. Just make sure to find that maid. ♪ ♪ May I help you? Is Father Ramon here? Yes, he's counseling a parishioner. Can you tell him Teresa Mendoza is here? Uh, yes, sure. I will let him know. Thank you. Teresa. Are you okay? No, I need the tunnel. I need to get these people back to Mexico. I bring good people over, not back. I don't know them. I hardly know you. How can I be sure I can trust you? You can't, but if you don't, this woman and her son will be dead. I don't have any vans leaving until the weekend. I don't need a ride. I just need directions. Leon. Camila Vargas. I'm sorry for your loss. Did you find anything out? I assume you know who I am? Who my husband is? You know our names, our reputations are of the utmost importance. So when you come into my town and accuse my men of having something to do with this, this is why you're here in front of me. No. I'm here because your man made a deal with my brothers, and now they're dead. Although he said he had nothing to do with it, I can make a lot of problems for you while I'm here looking for who did. You're smarter than you look. Just give me some answers. I'll be out of your hair. You're talking about going after a cartel. I don't care about the cartel. I'm not after their territory. I'm after the men who killed my brothers. You sure you want to go down this road? You do understand that if you attack a cartel, it just won't go away. We have swamps down there for people who come looking. What's his name? I can give you the man that engineered this hit. But you didn't hear it from me. You see, I have an agreement with the Jimenez people, and I'll be violating my accord if I put a move on this man. Lucky for you, then, I don't have an accord. His name is Eric Watson. They call him the Birdman. And this is where you can find him. Are you sure? Took a lot of work to find that out, but nothing happens here without me eventually knowing about it. So do it quickly, and then... get out of my city. ♪ ♪ (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, sh1t. I don't believe this. ♪ ♪ (phone vibrates) Take the next right. (hip-hop music) ♪ ♪ We've got a problem. ♪ ♪ (knocking at door) ♪ ♪ It's okay. You seem surprised to see me, Camila. What's the matter?

So bring her back to me and we can forget this ever happened. I'm not gonna be responsible for what you want me to do. Teresa, look, Camila doesn't know about this. I haven't told her yet. She doesn't have to know. But I need you to bring the maid back. She won't say anything. James : You have to trust me. Look, I'm trying to stop you from making a big mistake here. Wherever you think you're going, whatever you think you're doing, Camila will find you. We can keep this between us. I need you to come back. No. (dial tone) It's okay. They don't know where we are. (sighs) God will forgive you for what you did to us, but I won't. Brenda : It's okay. You did what you could. I need to go with them. No, you don't need to go... I need to go with them. No. Listen to me. I need to go back to Mexico to get what I told you can save our lives. We have no choice. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
