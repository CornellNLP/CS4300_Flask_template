 Previously on "Queen of the South"... 
 I need papers for me, my friend, and her son as soon as possible. New names and passports. 
 Need to get out of here. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I thought that you said everything was okay. 
 Everything is not okay. We need to disappear. 
 The Colombian shipment is arriving in Texas today. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 We're late with everyone. No one has their shipments. 
 People are wondering if there's change coming. 
 Why? 
 What the hell is going on up there? You know how much this cost me? 
 Someone knew the truck was coming. 
 Epifanio (over phone) : When was the last time you did a purge to see if anyone is talking to the DEA? 
 Maybe it's someone on your side. 
 Do I have to worry about you, Teresa? 
 No. 
 (brakes screeching) 
 (gunfire) Get down! 
 This is an act of war. 
 If he finds out I was trying to buy coke from the Colombians, we'd be at war with him, too. 
 How did it go? 
 Good. Did we go too far? 
 No. Keep going. 
 Hey, James. Those Florida people... 
 You said they have 25 kilos to sell. 
 We're gonna steal it. 
 Get up. 
 It's 4:00 in the morning. 
 Move, come on. 
 Where are we going? 
 I said where are we going? 
 You'll see. 
 (dark music) 
 ♪ ♪ Teresa, I need you to do something. It's important. Today is a different kind of business. Turning $2 1/2 million into 5... it's not an easy trick. You're gonna be taking the same risks as everyone. So I supposed you have the right to know what goes down... and how it goes down. Some guys are coming in from Florida this morning. We're gonna meet them, and we're gonna rip 'em off. You have proven you can be relied upon to do what I need. I don't know everything about you. You only reveal what you want. You're smart. Smart enough to understand why I protected you and kept you alive and kept you a secret from Epifanio, right? Why is that? I make him vulnerable. Because of what you saw his men do to Chino. You understand you're only leverage for me, right? But today, we have to take a risk. If something happens to you, I lose my leverage. I understand that. But if we don't succeed today, I don't have anything left, and leverage means nothing. And with nothing, I cannot protect you. So we all lose if we fail. I know you're scared. Use that fear to stay alive. After all, you're a survivor. Be in touch. (car engine starts) (car alarm beeps) (dramatic music) (coughing) (speaking Spanish) (sobbing) (speaking Spanish) Tell me. What time did you go to work today? (speaking Spanish) If you cooperate with me, this will only take a few minutes. You gonna help me out here? I want you to tell me everything about your work. Everything about that hotel. I want to know about the security cameras, and I want your pass key. They reset the keys every day. We only get them when we come in. If you tell anyone we were here, we will come back for you. Do you understand? Okay. (faint Latin music) Open the door,  cabrones. What the hell are you locking the door for? Creepy ass neighbor keeps coming in so we locked it. What neighbor? The one in the bathrobe selling the Xbox. Oh, right, yeah. Scored on three milligram tabs. Sweet. Yeah. You figure it out? I'm not stupid. Yes. Childproof. (speaking Spanish) I mean, you do have a child, so... Pendejos. Why are you so angry? 'Cause I don't want to be here. I don't want to be here. I just want to get back to the life we had in Sinaloa. You have no idea. You have no idea what kind of life I was living there. The clothes I had. The... the furniture. The... look at this place. Look at me. And my son, anything he wanted his father got for him, and now, what are we sleeping in? Some sleeping bag in some shitty ass motel. Oh, it's... it's not that bad, yo. That's easy for you to say. You don't have kids. No, my son is gonna have a future. In this world, you don't become what you want to, you become what you have to. (knocking) Where are my Benjamins at? An Xbox like this is hard to find. You know I'm gonna have your money. I need it today. Well, I don't have it today. By tonight I'll have this sh1t I'm working on sold, you'll have your money. (sighs) You know, 11C is interested. (chuckles) Oh, my God. Don't be so dramatic, Hector. It's a used Xbox with a left trigger jam from Sriracha. I'm just saying, I got options. Anyone can make methamphetamines. Using items that can be purchased in your local store, it's really not as hard as it looks. We're working today with three milligram tablets. This is the stuff that holds the pill together. The goal of this process is to extract the pure pseudoephedrine from cold tablets. The tools we're using are crude but dangerous. Methyl alcohol from gasoline additives, ether from spray cans, and lithium from batteries. Ingredients for making meth are legal, inexpensive, and easily available. Ha. It's dissolving into the ether layer, see that? He was right. It's as easy as making cookies. Why are you telling me this like it was your idea, Ricardo? Now that you've seen my meth tutorial, subscribe to my channel to learn how to make LSD from backyard pool chemicals. So simple. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ This is it. Now we wait. Oh, yeah. Texas, man. Let's do this. I'm psyched to do this. I'll be psyched when we unload this and we're on our way home. Uh, he doesn't like people touching his bag. (phone ringing) Yeah? They're here. Okay. All right, this is the tracker. When you're ready, you take it out. Just holding the edges, don't touch it flat on. The charge lasts two hours. Where do you get this? You can get anything on the black market these days if you can afford it. All right, you should go. (car beeping) (funky music) ♪ ♪ Pull the car over. ♪ ♪ (phone ringing) (speaking Spanish) Camila (over phone) :  Estas solo? Si. So I was sitting thinking that ever since you left, things have been happening to me. Bad luck. Camila (over phone) : What if you did tell him, Cesar? That you're taking drugs from Colombia behind his back? And you're three times bigger than he knows? That you hide that  puta,  ridiculing him with your team? That you plan on taking him over? You tell me. If I had told him, he'd kill you. And you know that. Camila (over phone) : Yeah. I'm in a bit of trouble. And I'm beginning to think he's encouraging it. The shipment's lost. From Mexico, from Colombia. Everyone seems to be messing with my business. Eric  el Cabron  is stepping all over me and Epifanio hasn't done anything about it. You know, Cesar, there are lots of ways to kill someone. Camila (over phone) : Destroying my business. Making me go back to Mexico. Back to him... that would be death to me. If he is behind these things, I don't know anything about it. Sometimes bad luck is just bad luck. Yeah, that may be so. But my instincts are seldom wrong. If he found out something, he may also know that you hid something from him when you were here. (speaking Spanish) I'm sure Epifanio... (speaking Spanish) (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ (camera shutter clicking) ♪ ♪ (phone vibrating) James. What's up, man? John, you in yet? Yeah, man, we made it. James (over phone) : Welcome to town, bud. How was your flight? It was good, good. Where are y'all staying? We're close. In the city. James (over phone) : Nice. Hey, it's all gonna be cool? It's gonna be all good, brother. Thanks for reaching out, man. We are psyched about getting this deal done. James (over phone) : All business. I like that. James (over phone) : Listen, I thought we'd meet at this place I know. Hey, you know, I think I'd like to be the one to pick the place out when that time comes, if that's all right? James (over phone) : No problem. It's just, I thought, I know Texas. Us Broward County boys, we did our homework, too. We know all about Texas. I'll pick a spot and give you a call. James (over phone) : Sounds good. I want you to be as comfortable as possible here. Yeah, we'll be in touch. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ (elevator dings) ♪ ♪ So everything's cool? I had to set some boundaries, tell him what's up. But that's how it's done though, right? That's right. (chuckles) ♪ ♪ (both speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) (both speaking Spanish) I now know your name. The people I work for can find you and your family. So you have to be quiet and do what I say.

I'll hear you. Just do what I say and nothing will happen to you. Okay? (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ Where are those goddamn Tums? Jesus, Reggie, it's gonna be fine.

Come on in. It's okay. Sorry, Sue, go ahead, babe. Yes, I promise I'll call her. I double promise. Two vodkas. (indistinct chatter) Why the sh1t is that guy staring at me for? (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ Why's he staring at me, man? ♪ ♪ 
 
 Are you Reggie? Yeah. Who are you? He asked you what your name was, Sancho. My name is not important, but my message is. Yeah, what's that? Go back to Florida. Because if you're thinking about doing a deal with Camila Vargas, that's gonna be a problem for other people who control this territory. And, amigo? You don't want to be a problem for other people. I don't know what you're talking about. No one's doing any deal. Just want to get a drink. Going home. That's it. I'm done, I'm done. Nope. Nah, I'm gonna be outta here before you know it. (chuckles) Yeah, Reggie's Reggie. What do you expect? He sh1ts himself first sign of rain. Hey. Can you bring more shampoo? Sure. What's wrong? (phone rings) What's up, John? Slow down, slow down. He was Mexican, and he said we better go back to Florida. Slow down, slow down. He knew our names. Well, at least he knew my brother's name. What'd he look like? He had two prison tats under his eyes, tear drops. How'd this guy know, man? Reggie (over phone) : They must've been following us from the get-go, from the airport. Wait... wait a sec. Did the guy have, like, these beady little eyes that look like two piss holes in the snow? Beady eyes? Beady eyes. What, you know him? Yeah, it's the Jimenez cartel. The Jimenez cartel? What the sh1t do they have anything to do with this? James (over phone) : Relax. He's just trying to scare you. They're trying to make problems for us, not you. James (over phone) : You're in our territory and they know it. I don't know how they know you're here. Maybe one of your guys in Florida opened his mouth. Who knows? It's gonna be okay.

You're never gonna see me again. Just come on up. Bueno. Come on, I'll put you back here. I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay, hang on.  Oye. How much longer is this gonna be? About half an hour or so, give or take. Is it gonna be ready tonight? 'Cause I got a guy on the phone that wants everything we got. Everything? Who do you think you're dealing with, a  pinche  school kid? Yeah, we'll be ready. Jesus. Smells like chemicals so bad in here. Yeah, it's supposed to. Drugs are chemicals. Trust me.

Yes, and I said the best swimmers drown and you told me I was being paranoid. Well, I think my husband's messing with me. And if I'm right about that, he could know many things. Maybe even what we're doing. So here's what I want you to do. You're gonna use one of your colleagues, someone who's sloppy, overconfident.

Well, with great risks come great rewards. I see in you a man that takes what he wants. I saw that ever since I first saw you. And I liked it. But it's not for me I'm asking you to do this. It's for you. So you can protect yourself. So why do I have the feeling that one of the goals of this entire thing is getting me to cross the line for you? Come on. No one's that good.
