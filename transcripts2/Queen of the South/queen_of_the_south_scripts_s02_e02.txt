 CAMILA: Previously on Queen of the South... 
   MAN: You don't know me, Teresa. 
  Guero's dead. 
   We had a deal. 
  No time if I talk. 
   My boss is done with all that. 
   Help us take down Camila. 
   Do you have any idea what you're asking me to do? 
   I told you I didn't want my hands dirty. 
   EPIFANIO: This is Aurelio Casillas. 
   The book your boyfriend, Guero, gave him  is causing his cartel grief. 
   There are a lot of stories about me in that book. 
   You have a top lieutenant in prison. 
   (explosion) 
   CAMILA: I can take him out of there for you. 
   And if you do, Camila, we will be friends. 
   (distant horses neighing) 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   (door closes) 
   What, you don't sit down to eat in Dallas? 
   Sit. 
   You know how to make a guy feel welcome, Jimenez. 
   Want me to light some candles,  or are you here to pet the horses? 
   No, I'm here on business. 
  Maybe show some respect. 
   So you want a statue because you jumped from the kid's table  to the table with men? 
   (grunts) 
   (laughs) 
   Finally, the man I've heard so much about shows up. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   (tense music) 
   ♪  (gentle piano music) 
   ♪  Consultant. 
   Executive consultant. 
   Titles and appearances are very important for these people. 
   Especially for you and I. 
   I gave you that dress and those shoes for a reason. 
   I hope they look good because they feel horrible. 
   We're here on business. 
   One drink. 
  Top shelf only. 
   Never finish the glass. 
   Now, tell me, are you gonna wear that dress,  or are you gonna continue to let it wear you? 
   That's Cole Van Awken. 
   He's the owner of the law firm that brokered the purchase. 
   Teo Aljarafe's boss. 
   Must be around somewhere. 
   Camila needs product. 
   Can you get it for us or not? 
   I don't see any money. 
   It's on Camila's word. 
  The money will come. 
   She's working on it now. 
   We got your brother out. 
  Seems like you owe us. 
   Come here. 
  Let me show you something. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   Míralo! 
  (clicks tongue) 
   I'm hosting the cartel race this year. 
   And this horse-- this horse was a lock. 
   I invested millions,  and now the only money I'll make back is from his dick. 
   That's a shame. 
   But what's your point? 
   Just because something was once valuable  doesn't mean it still is. 
   Given the current climate,  most would be fearful to do business with Camila. 
   But if you want any product,  you're gonna have to pay in cash. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   -(chuckling) 
  -I'll see you later. 
   (overlapping chatter) 
   -Mrs. 
  Vargas. 
  -Hi. 
   -Lovely to see you. 
  -This is Teresa. 
   -Teresa. 
  -Nice to meet you. 
   So your shipping business really seems to be taking off? 
   -All thanks to your firm. 
  -Hmm. 
   Teo did a very good job with the purchase. 
   Great lawyer. 
  His timing not so much. 
   KELLY ANNE: Hey, sweetie. 
  -Oh. 
   Camila, Teresa, this is my wife, Kelly Anne. 
   Or as I like to call her, my highest paid employee. 
   (chuckles) 
   Your house is beautiful, Mrs. 
  Van Awken. 
   I picked out every piece in this place. 
   The last name just came with it. 
   -Call me Kelly Anne. 
  -Teresa. 
   I'm an executive consultant with Camila's company. 
   Executive. 
   Isn't that impressive? 
  You hear that, honey? 
   -Hmm. 
  -Huh! 
   -Beautiful dress. 
  -Thank you. 
   Nice meeting you. 
  If you'll excuse me. 
   Sure. 
   -Excuse me. 
  -Nice to meet you. 
   Are we in business? 
   Jimenez agreed to sell, but it's cash only. 
   Our credit's gone. 
   How easily men forget. 
   His brother would be rotting in jail if it wasn't for us. 
   King George said he'd ship for us,  but I don't think he can wait long,  so we need that cash fast. 
   I think Teo can help us with that. 
   Excuse me.

  -Hi. 
   ♪  Come on. 
   ♪  What's all this? 
   -Privacy.

   You just told us.

   Yeah. 
  We cannot afford that. 
   Let's get out of here. 
   ♪  I don't care what Cole says.

   I'm a businesswoman. 
  An executive. 
   Isn't that right? 
   What's your drink of choice? 
   Oh, don't tell me. 
  You're a cerveza girl. 
   Was that racist of me? 
   Asking a Mexican if they like cerveza? 
   (chuckles) 
   I was a kept woman once. 
   See, now we're getting somewhere. 
   But a cartel came,  killed everyone I love,  and sent me running for my life. 
   Never looked back since. 
   (chuckles)

   Multiple times. 
   Lots of cash changing hands. 
   Millions. 
   Which is exactly what we need. 
   We'll have to be smart about it. 
   We will be, but we have no other choice. 
   We need cash now. 
   Find Teresa and meet me at the house. 
   Had a little bit of trouble with Epifanio. 
   I had to get out of Culiacán. 
   You left me. 
   It wasn't up to me. 
   You left. 
   Teresa, please. 
   Please what? 
   I had to run from our life... 
   because you were dead. 
   Look, Epifanio, he was-- he was on his way to kill me. 
   (softly gasps) 
   All right, they had to do something, okay? 
   -If I could go back-- -Who's they? 
   The DEA.

   Yeah, only after I knew you were out of there.

   Living in a safe house doesn't mean you're safe. 
   (gasps) 
   (exhales) 
   And a gun in the closet... 
   can't save you. 
   All this... 
   means nothing if you die wearing it. 
   Camila knows this very well. 
   She thinks that she knows the truth  about poor girls from Culiacán. 
   What truth? 
   That nothing distracts like glitter. 
   Camila will surround you with distractions.

   This year, the honor goes to our good friend Manuel Jimenez. 
   And out of the four other bosses,  I don't have to tell you about Aurelio Casillas. 
   I doubt he's forgotten you, Teresa. 
   He may still want you alive. 
   ♪  A million dollars minimum lets you in the race. 
   Then the money moves from our hands to a holding cell. 
   Then the man inside, "El Contador,"  he verifies the amount by weighing it. 
   Then the money moves to counting machines  just to make sure it's real. 
   POTE: Tons of cash,  but the place is a vault. 
   Every safe can be cracked. 
   Maybe we don't have to steal it. 
   If we pick the right horse,  just give us the money,  and the odds will pay us whatever we need. 
   That's if we had a million cash to get in. 
   We don't need it. 
   Just need to make them think it's a million.

   I can help you look the part. 
   Your instinct will keep you alive. 
   But loyalty... 
   Loyalty cannot be taught. 
   You know how James came to me? 
   Before the enemy was my husband,  the Castillas cartel was fighting us over territory. 
   So to send a message to Epifanio,  they put a hit on me. 
   CAMILA: James had just gotten out of the Service. 
   He was invisible to me. 
   Until he wasn't. 
   I don't know if it was instinct  or if he was trying to climb up the ladder,  but doesn't matter. 
   When the assassin came for me,  James proved his loyalty. 
   No weapons. 
   Not one word spoken. 
   And it was done. 
   Action... 
   That's loyalty without question. 
   He's been with me ever since. 
   Money's a little short. 
   He must've taken some out before I got to him. 
   But we're good now, right? 
   We're good. 
   Your mistake cost a life. 
   James just fixed it. 
   That's loyalty. 
   Listen. 
   You'll be safe. 
   We'll be all around you. 
   You don't cross Camila Vargas. 
   I know. 
   And it's a good thing I don't have to. 
   -You do. 
  -(scoffs) 
   Cheer up. 
   You're finally working for the good guys. 
   (sighs) 
  Oh, man. 
   Okay. 
   Now, from where I stand,  you got two choices. 
   You go order that overpriced steak  and you get Camila talking,  or... 
   we go tell your family you'll be missing  the next couple years for statutory. 
   (phone buzzing) 
   Teo, what's going on? 
   About those funds you requested. 
   I think I may have a workaround. 
   CAMILA: Yeah, I figured you might. 
   We'll talk about my cash flow over dinner. 
   Where are you thinking? 
   CAMILA: Same place. 
   Usual time. 
   You got it.

   Why are you doing this for me? 
   It's like I said. 
   We're in this together. 
   Thank you.

   Setting me up? 
   With who? 
   The DEA. 
   Had Teo been successful,  they would be investigating me too,  and that I cannot have.

   Teo was a risk to both of us. 
   Was?
