 Woman : Previously on  Queen of the South... 
 Epifanio : You leave me now, you die. 
 What did she do to you? 
 Epifanio (over phone) : That  puta  and Guero stole from me. 
 If you find this girl, let me know. 
 Epifanio has men everywhere looking for her. 
 Whatever he wants her for, it's very important. 
 Important enough to pretend she doesn't mean anything. 
 James : The second she takes an interest in you, it's gonna be harder for you to get out. Just do small things when you're asked. 
 She'll get bored with you. 
 Camila : When life gave you a choice about what to do with the man that stole from us... 
 Just let him go. 
 You chose mercy. That was the wrong choice. 
 Women in this business, we cannot afford to look weak. 
 When I agreed to do this, I didn't mean antagonizing  one of the largest businessmen in Sinaloa. 
 Camila : Everything my husband has, I help him build. So if you're afraid of him, you have to be afraid of me too. Teresa, where are you? Why aren't you here? Find a coyote who can take you to Dallas, Texas. Brenda : This better be worth it, Teresa. You tell me. Is America as bad as everybody says it is? You're gonna love it here. (train horn blows) (man rapping in Spanish) ♪ ♪ (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ Did you take my toothpaste? ♪ ♪ Puta. There's a flower that grows in the darkness. It's called  lirio de los valles.

I want to show you something. (indistinct chatter) James : It's your first delivery alone. You're moving up in the world. (cell phone chimes) Here's where you're going. I've texted you both deliveries. These are the addresses. The first one is Sandra. She's expecting you. You deliver; you bring the money back to Camila's club. It's this one. Okay? You do not stop on your journey. That's how you get robbed or killed. I don't care if you hit something... a cat, a dog, a priest. You do not stop. Is that clear? Here's the key. You might have to pump the gas a few times to start it. If you get busted, you say nothing. You just give them this card. It's a lawyer. You don't say anything. I think I've proven that already. Yeah, and it's been proven to me that people need reminding. So remember what I've been telling you. You've been given a job to do. So be smart, and don't even think about running. I guarantee you that sh1t will not work. (cell phone ringing) Yeah. She's leaving now. (engine turns over) (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ Woman (over PA) : Jerry Collins, your client is waiting in the showroom. Jerry to the showroom, please. Camila, so good to see you. Jerry. Let me get you an espresso. We have your favorite, Kopi Luwak, straight from Sumatra. Nobody else in Dallas can get it. Oh, I'm not here for the coffee. Something wrong with the car? No, nothing like that at all. It runs like a dream. As a matter of fact, I like it so much, I'm gonna buy four more. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I want them delivered to Mexico. Not a problem at all. Shipped to your place in Sinaloa? No, they're not mine. They're gifts. Gifts, that's very gracious. Fully loaded, all the bells and whistles. There's a service we've been offering to our select customers: bulletproof glass, armor tech doors. It's very popular in Qatar. What am I looking at with that? I'm not so gracious. I understand. Good decision. Shall we discuss colors? Um, ruby red, emerald green, beluga black, and white. When can you have them delivered? The custom colors are going to take a few weeks, but I can get you the white one immediately. Send the paperwork to my office. ♪ ♪ (speaking Spanish) ♪ ♪ (both speaking Spanish) ♪ ♪ (people speaking Spanish) That's Eduardo... People don't like people who talk so much, Tony.

(speaking Spanish) Say hi. Say hi. Hi, Teresa. I miss you. I miss you,  chiquito. Okay, well, I can't wait to... Yeah, yeah. Brenda : We're at some supermarket. It's the biggest gringo supermarket I've ever seen. Lonestar Supermarket. No idea. Brenda : Are you sh1tting me? Teresa : Ask someone for directions to Oliver Street and 11th. Okay, there's a restaurant called Emilio's Café. Emilio's Café, okay? (train horn blows) Hello? How you doing? Hi. I'm Teresa. James sent me. Chris. Sandra's on her way back. Come on in. I'm not gonna bite you. Mind if I pat you down? Can I offer you something to eat? No, thanks. How's traffic? Okay. Usually it's hell around this time. (laughs) You must be lucky. You ever thought about going to the casinos? Go ahead, use the counter over there. It's cool. Last time I went to the casinos, I won $53. (dramatic music) Chris : You see, that morning, I lost a $53 pair of sunglasses. My girlfriend at the time, she was pissed. She gave them to me. But out of spite, I went back in there and won my money back. (laughs) Five minutes on that blackjack table. Whoo-hoo! So you from Mexico or Guatemala? Mexico. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Know how to cook that Mexican food? Teresa : Yeah, I do. My grandmother taught me how to cook. Hell yeah. (sniffing) Yeah, I like women that can cook. I could sit still for that. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. ♪ ♪ Chris : Truth is, when it comes to me and food, I'm so country, the last time I had a seven-course meal, it was possum and a six-pack of beer. (sniffing) Oh, good sh1t. (sniffs) Oh, yeah. How about you? You want to do a line? Teresa : No, I'm good. I like my women high. And can cook. (yells) Chris : Wendell! (gunshots) (groaning) Wendell : Ah, sh1t. Oh, sh1t. Woman : Hey, hey, hey, be careful. He pumped that sucker. sh1t. You got more guts than you could hang on a fence. Cesar : It's very important. This again? I said I'd call him. Doesn't he have better things to worry about, the soon-to-be governor? Cesar : That's why I'm the one taking care of this. Camila : So how do you know she's still not in Mexico? (cell phone ringing) Yeah? James? It's Teresa. James : What's wrong? Hey, James. This is Sandra. Yeah, we got some issues over here. Your girl's okay. They tried to hang us. But the rope broke. James : What's the damage? Sandra : One dead asshole, one 'bout-to-be-dead asshole. But you need to get over here now. What's happening? I'm on my way. We've got a problem. Sí? I have to go. ♪ ♪ (soft music) ♪ ♪ See? It's gonna be fine. Let's see what we have in here. Let me see. Good? You. Me? You look like her. Thank you. Let's go outside and play. (scoffs) I'm sorry? I didn't travel a thousand miles to America to get sexually harassed by some shady-looking gringo. Do I look like a whore to you? Look... Is that what I look like? Like a whore? No, I'm... Mom, I'm hungry. Oh, my God. Mi'jo,  this is... this is terrible. This is... okay, honey,  mi'jo,  okay. You woke him up, and I was hoping that he would sleep all day so that I wouldn't have to feed him. Now I'm gonna have to feed him. Mi'jo,  I know. I'm sorry. No, just give me some money, and we can pretend that you never tried to lay hands on me. What? Just give me some money, and we can pretend that you never tried to lay hands on me! Okay, okay, all right. It worked. I know. It worked. Shh. (scoffs) Excuse me? You know, I didn't travel a thousand miles to America to get sexually harassed by some shady-looking gringo. (tires screeching) ♪ ♪ This one alive, Sandy? He was a minute ago. (groaning) Yeah, still alive. Are you hurt? Who gave you the confidence to do this? No one. You're bleeding so bad, you cannot even lie properly. Is it Eric from Jimenez cartel? The Bird Man? Was it him? (coughs) It's okay. We'll get that sorted out. You got another drop-off. No. Send someone else. She's had enough for today. You go back to the club now.

 (indistinct police radio chatter) Good afternoon, Officer. How can I help you? Do you have any idea how fast you were driving? Oh, I'm sorry, Officer. I don't. Officer : Wake her up. Um... I said wake her up. She's tired. Can she just... I'll give you my registration. I don't want your registration, César. You know, the truth is, I was really hoping you were reaching for a gun in there. And then Garcia here, he's gonna redecorate this Chrysler with pieces of what used to be you. I see. Camila Vargas. You're not as dumb as you look. Both hands on the wheel. Oh, you think you're the bad guy? Dirty cop bad guy? You're not, my friend. I'm a real bad guy, Officer Bradley. Hey, come on, now. You're gonna have to wake up. Let's go. Get up. Cesar : You're making a mistake, Mr. Bradley. Very big, very big. I'm going to find everyone who you ever had a kind feeling for, and I'm... and I'm gonna make them pay for this mistake today. Come on. This way. Watch your head. Cesar : I promise. I promise. (groans) ♪ ♪ (dance music playing) ♪ ♪ James : I've seen a lot of girls in my time who are trouble. And you are trouble. Did you see what he hit you with? Got to get me one of those. You know, you were lucky today. If Camila didn't have a few state troopers on her payroll... What is she gonna do with Batman? That's between them. Between us, I've got a plan for a future. And it doesn't include getting killed by crossfire meant for you. Don't expect to get lucky again. Where can I get ice? Ice machine's down the hall. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ Camila : You surprised me by coming here. She is. I'm sure of it. Because you're here. I know your loyalties are with him. But given the circumstances... If I kill you tonight, he's going to know I did it. I can't get out of this gracefully. So you're going to go home tonight. You decide whether to tell Epifanio what you know... or not. Epifanio's going to win the governorship. He told me once he's settled, he's going to reclaim the throne, the throne he promised you. And then Epifanio's going to sleep peacefully that night, knowing he has everything. When I return to Mexico, if you become my ally, I'm going to compensate you in the way you deserve. With me, César, you can make real, real money. ♪ ♪ (dance music playing) Camila : You can go now. You saved my life. Thank you. Why? I have my reasons. Go get some rest. James : I still think it's a mistake. We should've given her back to Epifanio in the first place. Not all cards are meant to be played at once. She has a purpose. Her time will come. And Batman? I mean, do you really think you can trust him? I don't know. But I'll be ready if it turns out I can't. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ (sobbing) (speaking Spanish) Yeah, tired. I need a bed. I need a shower. (both speaking Spanish) Listen to me. I can't stay. I can't stay with you tonight. Why? I need to go. Just take this money, okay? Get some food here. There's a motel just across the street. Go there, get a room, and I'll come for you tomorrow, okay? What's going on? Are you okay? Are they here? No. Listen to me. Listen to me. They're not here. They're not here. I left something in Mexico that can save our lives, okay? I just need to figure out how to get it. Everything's gonna be fine. Just wait for me tomorrow, okay? I'll be back. I'll be back here tomorrow. Tomorrow. I need to go. I'm so sorry. Don't leave the room. Okay. ♪ ♪ I'm okay. You don't come to see a $1,000-an-hour lawyer this late at night if you're okay. Better? Yeah. You know the trawler company I asked you to buy? There's no physical way to prove that I'm the one that's buying it, right? No chance. It's set up through shell corporations. It's impossible to trace back to you. Why? One of Epifanio's men, a very dangerous man, came down today to look into my business. I'm afraid they're gonna start to dig deeper into everything, attempting to understand what I'm gonna use a trawling company for. And what do you plan on using it for? I told you. I'm gonna take over my husband's business. And shipping is an important part of that. Do you want me to sell it? What would I want you to do that for? No, as long as it's done quietly, you don't have anything to worry about, right? I did my job. Good. You're not afraid of... of a war? This is not a war yet. And even if there is, I'm gonna win. You're not used to this. No. Do you like it? Breaking the rules? Skirting the law? You just made me think of violating ten laws in the state of Texas. Why stop now? Let's get through with this first, and then maybe you'll get what you want. ♪ ♪ Papi! Papi! Epifanio (over phone) : I need an update before midnight, Juan Carlos. I'll have a better idea if I can ship by dawn. Now, that's the kind of answer I like. By the time the minute hand strikes 12, your phone will ring. Papi! Papi! Epifanio : And tell Miguel that I said that he needs to be more respectful when stopped by police. There are some problems I can't get him out of. Okay. I'll tell him. Papi,  come outside. You have to see. Okay. Are you Juan Carlos Ortega? Yeah, what's going on? You got a delivery. From who? They just said "a friend." (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ It's good to have friends. (line trills) Juan Carlos (over phone) : Hello? Did I choose the right color? Yes. Pleases me to know you remember. Oh, I remember many things, including the amounts of money you used to make before I left. So you've been paying attention all the way from Texas? Enough to know that now that Batman runs things, you don't own a part of the building anymore. Sometimes you have to accept the way things are going. Or not. You know, because if things go back the way they used to be, it's so much sweeter. When have you ever known me not to have a plan? I like what I'm hearing. Keep talking. Changes are coming. I'll be in touch. ♪ ♪ (breathes deeply) The Queen : Like I said, there's a flower that grows in the darkness,  lirio de los valles. So many reasons it shouldn't exist. It must be celebrated. You are one of those flowers. So you may as well bloom, because it's gonna be dark for a while. ♪ ♪ . What is it about society that disappoints you so much? Sometimes I dream of saving the world, saving everyone from the invisible hand, the one that controls us every day without us knowing it. What if this all went away? The city, the money, all of it? Hey, kiddo. Exciting time in the world right now, exciting time. Tell me about your father. He had leukemia, made me swear to never tell anyone. Finally I got so worried, I told my mom. I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry. He shoved me so hard, I fell backwards out the window. I was eight years old. If you don't take this deal, you'll become like me,  losing everyone's respect. I gave up everything for this case. I don't want you to. I'm not working there. They killed my mother. If you want to change things, perhaps you should try from within. That would erase... All the debts we owe them. Every record of every credit card, loan, What do we all do now? Guys, this isn't about what we'll do tomorrow. This is about what we did. They're free because of us. Jesus, what did I do? I told you we shouldn't have done this. I'm a little concerned for Tyrell  because he was acting very strange last I saw him. I know you're behind it, fsociety, the server, Colby, Allsafe. You're the one constant in a sea of variables. No matter what anyone tries to do, I will never leave you. I will always be right here. Do you understand that? They're gonna try and get rid of me again, and I need you to not let them. Listen to me. I will never leave you. I will never leave you alone again. I am Mr. Robot. I've always told you we'd end up working together, Elliot, but still I have to know, why did you do it? I wanted to save the world. [soft music] ♪ ♪ Why this mask? It's a bit silly, isn't it? [phone vibrating] Wellick. I see. I understand. James, yes. Yes, I'm aware of Mr. Goddard's request, but it needs to be removed this moment. Can you escalate it? Thank you, James. ♪ ♪ It should be ready. [tense music] ♪ ♪ What is it? It's happening. ♪ ♪ It's almost as if... something's come alive. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [glass shattering] Oh, my God. This is your fault! It's your fault! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry! What did you do, you son of a bitch? He's bleeding! It was an accident. God says there are no accidents! Son, son, please talk to me. Talk to me please. God help us, he's bleeding. The neighbors are looking. This is embarrassing. Son, son, wake up. Wake up! God, is he okay? Ask if he's okay! Can't you see he's not responding, Magda? It's your fault, it's your fault! It was an accident. God says there are no accidents. I'm so sorry. Please call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! [monitor beeping] As you can see by the images, everything appears to be normal, which is good news because there were no lesions from the scan, no hemorrhaging or bleeding, mild concussion, a few stitches. The forearm, however, is broken, so that will require a cast. And how much will that be? Excuse me? How much will the co-pay be? Well, that's something you need to discuss with the billing department. We'll talk about that later... Shut up. You've lost your job. We have no money. How are we supposed to pay for this on top of all your other bills? Don't touch me. I told you, there won't be any bills. Mr. and Mrs. Alderson, please, I'm going to have to ask you to step outside for a second. I'd like to talk to Elliot alone. Elliot. Elliot, I want you to know that you are going to be just fine. Now, that was quite a spill you took today, but I promise, you have a long and healthy life ahead of you. Now, Elliot, there are just a few questions that I need to ask you, and anything you tell me... [voice distorting and fading] [tense music] ♪ ♪ [I Monster's "Daydream In Blue" playing] ♪ ♪ ♪ Daydream ♪ 
♪ I fell asleep beneath the flowers ♪

♪ Such a beautiful day ♪ Time to get up. ♪ ♪ Today started just like yesterday and the day before that and the day before that and every day for the last month, a loop, my perfectly constructed loop. This is going to be affecting our economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant. The FBI announced today, and we can confirm, that Tyrell Wellick and fsociety engaged in this attack. They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond. We will respond proportionally, and we will respond in a place and time that we choose. That's not something that I will announce at a press conference. At 8:00 a.m. my daily program begins by having breakfast with my friend, Leon. There's this one episode where they go to this Chinese restaurant, and they're just waiting for a table the entire time. Like, they don't even eat at the end, bro. He just discovered "Seinfeld." Maybe I'm overthinking it, though. And talks way too much about it. It's really f*cking with him. It's really f*cking with me. But it's perfect for me. I don't have to say anything. I can just listen. God, man, that Kramer dude, if I knew him in real life, I'd knock his ass out. At 10:00 a.m. I help out around the house. More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road. Right now it's sort of the Wild West. At 12:00 p.m. I have lunch with Leon. And then there's this one where they're stuck in a garage the whole time. Like, what? That's not a TV show, bro. Where's the story? It just makes no sense. At 2:00 p.m. we'll check out a basketball game. Hot Carla, the local pyro, is usually there. She's become like my personal totem. You ain't sh1t. Whoo, three points, bitch. [yelling] I still don't understand why people like sports. They get so emotional over the weirdest things.
