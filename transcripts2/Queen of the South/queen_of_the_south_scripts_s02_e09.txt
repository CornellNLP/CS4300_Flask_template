 TERESA: Previously on Queen of the South... 
   You want a war, Epi, I'll give you--  -Tu hermano! 
  -(speaking Spanish) 
   Today, we announce the formation of  a joint US-Mexico drug task force. 
   CORTEZ: He's brought the war here. 
   Isn't it time that we put an end to her? 
   Do what you got to do to stop Camila's business. 
   But don't touch my wife. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   I want to be part of the business. 
   Don't forget whose house you're in and who built it. 
   Good afternoon. 
  I'm Devon Finch. 
   Finch isn't the only distributor we can work with. 
   No, but he's the one I want. 
   All of you are going to Chicago, and make him buy from us. 
   We just caught a break in Chicago. 
   Take Colonel Cortez with you. 
   Something's wrong. 
   (grunts) 
  (blows land) 
   What are you doing, man? 
  The DEA don't roll like that! 
   (gunshot echoes) 
  Hey! 
   Here, take your car. 
  Meet Devon. 
   We'll get him help. 
   Well, you wanted my attention, Miss Vargas. 
   Now you have it. 
   I'm leaving. 
  There's something I got to take care of. 
   (dramatic musical flourish) 
   (dramatic electronic music) 
   ♪  Pote says James needs a few more days to recover  from the beating Cortez gave him. 
   so they're gonna stay in Chicago until he's ready to travel. 
   It's really not good for me to be alone,  especially if things go south with Devon Finch. 
   You're only gonna make a deal. 
  You don't need muscle. 
   You seem very certain of that. 
   If we strike the deal, are you sure El Santo  will provide us with the product we need? 
   If he doesn't, I'll have to go back to Bolivia. 
   CAMILA: Without your boyfriend? 
   I sent him away in Chicago, like you told me to. 
   Guero was an irritating little mosquito,  draining you from your spirit, Teresa. 
   We have to secure this deal today. 
   Otherwise, El Santo's sicarios  are gonna be on the first flight to Dallas. 
   And make no mistake about it:  they'll be looking for you first. 
   (phone buzzing) 
   (sighs) 
   Is everything okay? 
   Isabela has a little mosquito of her own  that needs to be crushed. 
   She'll learn the hard way,  just like you did.

   ♪  WOMAN: Welcome to the 2017 Dallas International Auto Show.

   This is our newest model, the 458 Italia Super Coupe. 
   We sold number two. 
   We're keeping for you number one. 
   ♪  It has a top speed of 211 miles per hour. 
   The chassis improvements provide enhanced performance  over your previous models. 
   No, thank you. 
   DEVON: You know what? 
   I could add a couple more vehicles to my collection. 
   My assistant will handle the details. 
   Always a pleasure. 
   A $1/4 million purchase in a second. 
   You move as fast as your cars do. 
   You know, when it's high quality and priced fairly,  there's no need for making negotiations. 
   Fairly according to you. 
   (soft laugh) 
   You don't get to build an empire like yours  by paying top dollar. 
   Are you gonna be a repeat customer,  or is this just a test drive? 
   It depends on how much is in the tank. 
   TERESA: A metric ton. 
   There's more where that came from. 
   You can guarantee that? 
   CAMILA: There's no guarantees in my line of work. 
   If you want security, stick to annuities. 
   Otherwise, what we offer  can get you every car in this room.

   ♪  Excuse me. 
   ♪  MAN (over TV): Culiacán governor Epifanio Vargas  is returning home to Mexico today  after reportedly suffering a minor heart attack  in the States, and receiving treatment  at Dallas University Medical Center. 
   Governor Vargas was in Texas for the launch of  a joint US-Mexican task force spearheaded by the DEA  and Mexican army colonel Alberto Cortez. 
   Focus on stopping a recent rash of cartel-related violence... 
   (phone buzzing) 
   EPI: Hola, Colonel. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   But if I'm dead, it doesn't matter anyway, now does it? 
   EPI: You saved my life before. 
   You are the only one I can trust to protect me. 
   Ones Dallas is burnt for Camila,  then I will return to Culiacán. 
   Camila inhales fire like others do a rose, Colonel. 
   If you haven't burned her by now, you won't. 
   It will still look like we made our best efforts to stop her. 
   Your voters will respect that. 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   But let me remind you that Camila is not to be touched. 
   CORTEZ: That goes without saying, Governor. 
   Nothing happens  without you giving the order first.

   Are you stalking my IG? 
   You have no regard for what  you're exposing yourself to. 
   Ay, it's not like you give a damn. 
   You're hardly poster mom of the year. 
   Well, you know, Kique Jimenez is a problem,  and I'm gonna tell you why:  his uncle is dead and his father is  headed for prison or the grave. 
   Yeah. 
  I bet you wish it was Dad instead. 
   (distant indistinct chatter) 
   Nice, Isabela. 
   What? 
  You pushed him over the edge  and that's why he ended up in the hospital. 
   You should have been the one with the heart attack.

   -Agent Truesdale. 
  -Thank you. 
   What was that about? 
   Colonel Cortez briefed me on what happened in Chicago. 
   Your report seems to be missing some info. 
   Cortez claims that you lunged after D'Avila  and your lack of control led to his escape. 
   Again.

   Everything that happened in Chicago was by the book. 
   So unless Cortez has evidence to the contrary...

   Cortez has a lead on D'Avila in Juarez. 
   Guero won't step foot across the border.

   Yeah. 
  I'm sorry. 
   She had to take the call. 
   It's family. 
   But you're not her blood. 
   How did you manage to claw your way out of Culiacán? 
   A dead boyfriend,  his gun,  and an opportunity. 
   (soft chuckle) 
   That sounds like more teeth than claw. 
   What was the opportunity? 
   -Camila. 
  -So she is family? 
   What about you? 
  Where do you come from? 
   Here and there. 
   I tell you everything and you tell me nothing.

   Hello? 
   ALONZO: Teresa Mendoza. 
  This is Agent Loya. 
   What do you want? 
   ALONZO: You met me with Agent Finnerman. 
   I was Guero's handler. 
   Guero's in danger. 
   You know where he is? 
   ALONZO: He was spotted in Juarez. 
   If Guero stays in Mexico,  I think we both know his days are numbered.

   Once you've got the metric ton,  you won't have a problem  compensating for our asking price. 
   Why would I pay more per key than what I'm paying now? 
   Those numbers don't add up for me. 
   TERESA: They will. 
   Once you handle the product right. 
   You have a suggestion, Miss Mendoza? 
   You make money by running product  through your private jet company. 
   You save money by cleaning it through your hotels. 
   Those numbers make sense,  but what is coming in doesn't. 
   (soft dramatic music) 
   You're selling weaker product for 80 grand a kilo, right? 
   If you buy from us, you can charge 130. 
   I charge based on my market. 
   Your customers will pay for what we have. 
   Either they buy from you, or Camila,  but there's only one way both of you get paid. 
   ♪  My understanding is that El Santo  only deals with people he considers cult members. 
   Yeah, that's right. 
   So you've met him? 
   I went to Bolivia. 
   There won't be a problem with the supply. 
   I'll give you 3 million for 100 keys. 
   If all goes well with my customers,  I'll take the rest of it and deliver 27 million. 
   CAMILA: Good. 
   But I'm gonna need that sum to be rolled out in payments. 
   DEVON: You can't launder that amount? 
   Well, I just changed accountants. 
   My associates don't hold that much cash. 
   I handled money in Culiacán. 
   Maybe I can help to find a way.

  Finch had in mind. 
   Would you please step away while I finish my business?

   You think you're selling Devon on a good deal?

   Don't let your ego tell you otherwise.
