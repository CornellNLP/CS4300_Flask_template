 Teresa :  My name is Teresa Mendoza. I am from  México. 
 I was born poor, not that that's bad. But take it from me, I've been poor. And I've been rich. Rich is better. Believe me. Because now I run the biggest drug empire in the Western hemisphere. You could say, I'm living proof that the American dream is alive and well. And I've become good at it. And you may not agree with how I got here, but I don't care. And you shouldn't judge. Thanks to me, you always had weed for your stupid weekend dinner parties or a gram for your shitty bachelorette thing. 
 (snorts) 
 You're welcome. But the trick... is to stay alive long enough to enjoy the fruits of this labor. 
 (gunshot) 
 In this business, your shelf life is only so long. I knew this day would come. People have been trying to do this since Sinaloa. 
 (rap music) 
 (men shouting indistinctly) 
 Hola, buenas. How much? 
 A thousand. 
 Theresa :  And I kept my nose clean... sort of. I had a drug of choice. His name was Güero. A Chicano from Texas. 
 Hola. Do you need money changed? 
 Just watching you change money is enough.

 How much? 
 Brenda : Oh, my God, Güero. 
 What's taking you so long? 
 Ya cálmate m'ija haya voy Oh, my God! 
 Look how pretty you are. 
 Look at those legs. 
 Chino, look how pretty this girl is. 
 She is so pretty. 
 Oh, honey, you're too pretty to be working here. 
 Chino : What? Okay, she's pretty. Hey, you're beautiful. 
 The two of you could be twins.

 Brenda : He's always exaggerating! 
 Chino, that hurts! Don't do that! 
 I don't like that! Ow.

 You ever do that to another girl, I'm gonna find you.

 So... now that you're out of a job, you coming with us?

 Theresa :  I never really had friends or much of a family, so fate sent me a new one. Güero, his cousin Chino, and Brenda. 
 I can tell he really likes you. 
 I know this things 'cause I'm like a witch. 
 Bueno, a sexy witch. 
 (both laughing) 
 I can teach you so many things. 
 What do you think about Chino? 
 He's so cute, huh? 
 He talks a lot, but that's men, am I right? 
 I mean, you always have to be like, "Ay, you're so handsome. 
 Your cock is so big," blah blah blah. 
 I mean, he's not the brightest, but at least he's not complicated, huh? 
 Are you blushing? 
 Ay. 
 (toilet flushes)

 Toma, m'ija. 
 You'll be doing me a favor. 
 I got to dump this sh1t. 
 I think I might be pregnant again. 
 Congratulations.

 Theresa :  The men I knew before treated me like sh1t, but Güero... I felt like he saw me, protected me. So what if he was a drug runner? If you came from where I come from, you'd have done the same damn thing.

 It was like... heroin. I wanted it to last forever. 
 ♪ ♪ (mariachi music) ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter in Spanish) I know that a lot of you hear the word "cartel" and think drugs and guns, but for me, being with Güero was the first time I felt connected to someone. On our first Christmas, Güero took me to meet his godfather, Don Epifanio, the head of the cartel. I knew that meant something. Perdón. Perdóname. Don Epifanio and Batman are asking for you, Güero. And you, too, cabrón. I'll just be a minute. Don't get lost out here. ("We Wish You A Merry Christmas" playing) ♪ ♪ I wanted to talk to you about my political plans. (snorts, sniffing) It's going to happen. This time next year, I will be running for governor. Felicitaciones Don Epifanio. I know you know that Camila is not happy about this, but if you think she and I are still in a negotiation about it, we are not. During the next year, you're going to see our faces less and less. Campaigns are about impressions. I need to distance myself from the business. So we are making slow changes now. And you will begin to take over day-to-day operations. But I'm a bit worried. About what? You are aggressive. I was able to cover for you. That's going to stop if I'm not here. If I'm running our thing, I have to do it the way I see it. Feliz Navidad. (door opens) (singing Christmas carols in Spanish) ...no ya basta con estos cantos de la... There he is. ¿Que pedo mi Batman, cómo estás? Don Epifanio : My Güero. Señor. Cómo estás, hijo? Bien. Mucho gusto verte. Que gusto. Hey, guys, did you hear this? In his last delivery up north, he landed on a strip of rock so small, he nearly killed himself and the reception crew. Hey, you know, I've had a good run. We all got to die sometime. Speak for yourself, man, I go a son. Your son would thank us. Believe me. Chino :  Hey, sírvanse por favor. (laughter) I'd like to thank you all for your loyalty, friendship, your hard work. To my family. Feliz Navidad. All : Feliz Navidad. And I'm looking forward to the good things that next year will bring. (mariachi music playing outside) ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter, laughter) ♪ ♪ She's the girl you told me about? Mm-hmm, Teresa. (cell phone ringing) Perdón. When your wife has to use a cell phone to call you from the room in your own house, your house is too big. Yes, yes, what do you want? Come upstairs now. Brenda : Oh, my God. Tere, look at this place. It looks like a castle. Ugh. I want to live here. Maybe we should go back to the party, Brenda. I don't like snooping around. Cabrona, rich people like when people snoop around in their house. Don't worry about it. (gasps) Look at these shoes. Oh, they're just sitting here. If there's a size six, I'm taking it. Stop it. Ay, nothing's gonna happen. Relax. Don't touch anything. sh1t. I got to pee. Is that okay? Keep an eye out. (Don Epifanio speaks indistinctly) Camila : No. Don Epifanio : Yes. Camila : It is my business too! I built this empire, and you're willing to throw it away and wash your hands of it. Don Epifanio : You are going to be by my side on the road to governor, like you've done for 25 years. And you're gonna do this. I'm not. I'm going to be governor of Sinaloa. And you're gonna help me get there. No. Yes, governor. It's my business too. I helped build this empire, and now you want to wash your hands of it? You want me to be a governor's wife? You can't run the business and be in an election. I'm talking about legitimacy. People ask questions. Our business will still run, but not with you and I at the helm, at least not for the foreseeable future. When I'm in there, we'll resume. Bigger, better more power. Camila : How long? Don Epifanio : One year in office, maybe two. The irony is insane. You're asking me to stop doing the only thing I became good at out of necessity. You forced us into this life. If it wasn't for me getting us out of that mess, running our business, you'd be back at being the dirt-poor farmer that you were. When you get like this, you say hurtful things. Well, if truth hurts, I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is. We're planning on expanding to Texas. (Don Epifanio laughs) I'll take Texas. Texas? You take Texas? Yes... away from you and your election. And you're gonna provide me with the product I need. Think of it as alimony. It's nonnegotiable, Epifanio. Maria has instructions to finish packing and send me the rest of my stuff. You'll be back. You're wrong. I'll call you when I'm settled. Don't come looking for me. And, farmer... you still use the wrong fork. (footsteps approaching) Perdón. I was just... just looking for the restroom. It's okay. It's not your fault. It's her fault. Let's blame her. I'm good with that. You? Epifanio. Teresa. I know. I've heard a lot good things about you from Güero. I'm sorry we met under such circumstances. But go ahead. Enjoy the party. I'll be down soon. Gracias. You cannot believe it. There's heat. There's wiping. There's washing while you're still on the toilet. What's wrong? (dramatic music) Theresa : Güero moved up the ranks of the cartel fast. We were happy. I know! Wait. Did you meet Batman's new morra? Oh, my God, Brenda. I met her at brunch. Really, she thinks she's so classy. She ate, like, a taco with a knife and fork. Brenda (over phone) : No, no, no, no. That's what I thought! Hey, baby. Brenda I'll call you right back. What happened? We were ambushed. We got to the landing strip, and everyone was dead. There were Federales everywhere. They just opened up and fired on me. Cessna's gone. I don't know what's going on. I don't know where this is gonna end, but I want you to be prepared. Okay, a ver... if this every rings, it's 'cause I'm dead. And you got to run to a safe house. You're gonna have money and you're gonna have blow to trade if needed, okay? And you got a passport there too. All right? Okay. If you're ever in deep sh1t, all right, you take this notebook, and you take it to Don Epifanio, and you trade it for your life, all right? Don't trust Batman. Go to Don Epifanio. What's in it? You don't want to know. All right, I mean it. Just... just... just don't read it, okay? Okay. So he'll help you out. He will. Theresa :  You want to know the truth? This stuff excited me. I thought, "This guy must really love me." A ver, mujer, say something. Teach me how to use this. (alarm blares, man speaking Spanish on radio) Happy anniversary. You like it? I love it. A bit concerned, though. You got all this in here without me knowing? In my line of business, I'm supposed to sleep with one eye open. Spoken like a true drug runner. Always looking for a way out. Not from you. I'm surprised. You usually only say things like that when I'm naked. (chuckles) Stop it! Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh. You better not. Why? Who's gonna take out the garbage? Yeah? Huh?

Wait, wait. Teresita, slow down. Toma. You have to get out of the house. What? Theresa (over phone) : They killed Güero. They may be coming after Chino. Oh, sh1t. Theresa (over phone) : What?
