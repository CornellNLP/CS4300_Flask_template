 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 I need five blue gels... cerulean blue. 
 I reserved them last week. 
 Yeah, hold on one second. 
 Hello? Yeah, Hi. 
 What's it at? 
 Hell, yeah, that's a great price. 
 Yeah, for me. 
 Let's do it. 
 We'll buy again when it gets back down to 30. 
 Yeah. No, no, don't buy it now. 
 No, we're going to sell it all. 
 Can you hear me? 
 We're gonna sell it all. 
 Hello? 
 Josh, are you still there? 
 Josh? 
 Age of technology, my ass! 
 Polk Street Station, Polk Street. 
 Open your mouth, I'll slice your throat, bitch.

 Original air date : 2000/04/28 
 The A or the C train? 
 The C train, now stopped at Spring Street... whole uptown line is shut down. 
 Let's get movin' on this. 
 Sure it's the same guy? 
 Same MO. 
 He carries a box cutter, waits till the train's almost at the station, then three seconds later, boom! 
 He's gone. 
 No one says, "How typical"? 
 Seven times in six months. 
 Makes it three times this month. 
 Hey, what's the matter with you? 
 If you must know, Monique, today is my wedding anniversary. 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 Which one? 
 Exactly. 
 Attack occurred between the Fulton and Chamber Street stations. 
 That's two stops before this one. 
 Right. 
 So the train keeps a-rolling, as if nothing happened? 
 Right. 
 What, it took her that long to find a transit cop? 
 Hey, who are you? 
 He's a reporter... works with The Post. 
 Nick Canzner. We're all working together to get this guy. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Anyway, once we heard, we shut down. 
 Did you secure the stations two stops back? 
 Got it wrapped up like a birthday present. 
 Good, and no peeking. 
 When can we get this train rolling, Detective? 
 Anything? 
 Everything and nothing. 
 That covers your ass. 
 What's your problem? 
 I hate bureaucrats. 
 Bureaucrats? Don't look in the mirror. 
 I try not to. 
 Anti-graffiti metal... resists the oil in the spray paint, resists the oils in the hands. 
 No prints? 
 Except here in the window, we've got several hundred. 
 How about footprints? 
 Just a couple of partials. 
 What else? 
 Yeah, right here. 
 If I hadn't stopped for coffee, I've would've been on a different train. 
 It's not your fault. 
 I know that. 
 All right, Jen, where did you get on the train? 
 At Hoyt-Schermerhorn. 
 I was headed up to 50th Street. 
 At the station, I stopped for a latte. 
 Did you see him at the coffeehouse? 
 No. 
 How about on the platform? 
 I don't know. 
 What did you do when he attacked you? 
 I just stood there. 
 It all happened so quickly, I couldn't believe it. 
 So much for taking kickboxing. 
 We have a description from the previous atta... 
 Excuse me. 
 From the previous attacks. 
 Does this man look familiar? 
 Well, yes, that looks like him. 
 It also looks like the Unabomber. 
 Did you get a good look at him? 
 Yeah. He was thin. 
 Sandy brown. 
 Pointy beak nose. 
 How tall was he? 
 I don't know. 
 And he had me pinned, you know. 
 He had a knife, something. 
 Did you see what he was wearing? 
 Yeah, he was wearing dark clothes and a hooded sweatshirt. 
 He was panting at me. 
 He was panting like a dog. 
 I don't believe this guy. 
 Anyway, he left his mark on my dress. 
 Arnold & Schreiber C.P.A 
 11 Astor Place Tuesday, April 4 
 I wasn't even sure what he was doing to her at first. 
 I just get so in the zone, you know. 
 On the train, ignoring all those blind people trying to sell you a keychain. 
 You learn not to see. 
 What did you see when you weren't in the zone? 
 He was on her and gone. 
 You notice him before? 
 I had just gotten on. 
 Did he get on with you? 
 I don't know. 
 You get a look at him? 
 He was white. Shorter than I. 
 How tall are you? 
 I'm 6'3"... so 5'10". 
 You look at his face? 
 No, he had a hooded sweatshirt and a heavy jacket on. 
 What kind of jacket? 
 Navy. 
 Like a pea coat? 
 I was Air Force myse... yeah, you could say it was a Navy pea coat. 
 What about his pants? 
 His what? 
 Pants, his pants. 
 Dirty, drips, streaks... like a painter. 
 I remember thinking, I don't want to get too close... 
 I don't want paint on my coat. 
 Did you notice him before he was on her? 
 No. 
 So he's on her and you're worried about your coat. 
 Today's attack, between Chambers Street Station and Fulton neatly fits into our pattern, which is that there is no pattern. 
 And we can assume... 
 That's the difference between us... you assume and we do the footwork. 
 Your footwork lead you to any profile yet? 
 Matter of fact, it did... a guy who wants to get caught. 
 So what's the problem? 
 You put decoys and ghosts on the trains and you look for pervs like you look for pick-pockets. 
 Why aren't you requesting transit cops on every train, installing security cameras in each car? 
 Hey, get with the 21st century, right? 
 We are, next year. 
 But all the computers in the world are not going to stop some guy from sticking his hand up some girl's skirt. 
 Rape, Greenberg! 
 Not fondling, not petting, not unwarranted advances... rape! 
 On your subway, remember? 
 I get on at Nostrand, close to where I live. 
 Do you get on the train the same time every day? 
 Yes, or sometimes if I'm a little late I stop for groceries. 
 So, had you ever seen this guy before? 
 He looks like everyone else. 
 Anyway, I don't look at men. 
 So, you don't know if he was on the train when you got on? 
 Yes. Maybe. 
 He ever talked to anyone? 
 Not to me. 
 Did you ever hear him say anything to the women? 
 He said something. 
 I didn't hear what he said. 
 Maybe he wasn't on the train when I got on. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Listen up, people. 
 Excuse me. 
 This is Dr. Audrey Jackson, a forensic psychologist. 
 Our friend the Deputy Commissioner decided it would be a good idea if she joined our team. 
 Oh. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 So? 
 We got a witness who saw paint spots on the guy's pants. 
 So he's a painter, construction maybe. 
 Does that narrow our list of priors? 
 We've been looking into it. 
 We found a plasterer with three priors for flashing. 
 Unfortunately, he lost a fight with a.44 last month. 
 Hardware stores, paint supply... the subway stops... what's on the block? 
 I'm all over it. 
 All right, very good. 
 Now this latest victim, the complaining witness... how does she resemble the other victims? 
 They were all women wearing skirts. 
 Women wearing skirts? 
 Is that all you got? 
 Women wearing skirts on the subway. 
 They're all different ages, different races. 
 Okay, what about body types? 
 Big, little? 
 Does he overpower them? 
 Well, he uses a knife. 
 But it's safe to say that's part of the thrill for him... overpowering them. 
 Yes, it's safe to say that. 
 Okay, I understand your resistance, but I was sent here to offer any psychological insight that may help you get this guy. 
 And believe me, we're over the moon to have your help. 
 So, what are your psychological insights? 
 On this guy? 
 Well, he's a dog. 
 What gets him off is the hunt. 
 Maybe he gets on the subway when he has an hour free, maybe he rides around all day until he finds the perfect victim. 
 You make it sound like foreplay. 
 Well, to him it is. 
 And with this kind of guy, you can't plant a decoy because he doesn't have a type. 
 So we wait. 
 We wait. 
 Wait's over, the dog found another human fire hydrant. 
 Let's go. 
 59th Street-Columbus Circle Subway Station Wednesday, April 5 
 What happened? 
 Made your life more interesting and my life a lot easier. 
 What happened? 
 Ballsy old lady sees the guy attack the girl, cries wolf. One guy wrestles him to the ground, another guy pulls the emergency brake between Lincoln Center and Columbus Circle. 
 I walk back in the tunnel, apprehend the suspect. 
 Call me the dog catcher. 
 What happened? 
 Train jerked, I fell against her. 
 You fell? 
 I fell. 
 How many times? 
 How many times what? 
 How many times did you fall against her? 
 She overreacted. 
 Maybe she underreacted. 
 I had one hand on the pole, the other hand was in my pocket. 
 Doing what? 
 I was just standing. hat's how I stand. 
 We've got three witnesses that put you on top of her. 
 Train jerked. 
 What you got on your pants there? 
 Paint. 
 You stand up for me? 
 Paint from what? 
 Window I did. 
 What do you mean, "a window"? 
 I'm not sure, I'm a little... 
 Confused... yeah, well, so are we. 
 She means you paint houses for a living, you're in paint all day long, right? 
 How do you know that splatter came from a window, right? 
 Right. 
 A window, my ass. 
 Take off your pants, please. 
 Do I have to? 
 Yeah, you do. 
 Can I say something? 
 Oh, by all means. 
 I want to explain something. 
 Please. 
 When I said "a window," 
 I meant a store window. 
 Explain further. 
 I kinda do window displays. 
 Kinda? 
 Window displays. I make them. 
 Why didn't you say so before? 
 You know, people think it's a little fruity. 
 Nah, but you're not. 
 No. 
 You like women? 
 Yeah... no, I mean... 
 Take off your pants please. 
 You like him for this? 
 Do I like him? 
 For this... for the flop sweat, the lack of eye contact, like a kid who's lying about a book he didn't read. 
 He's feeling guilty about something. 
 Maybe he's Catholic, feels guilty about everything. 
 Stay standing. 
 The seat is cold. Thank you. 
 We're going to do a DNA check on the sample in these pants. 
 We're going to match it against the seven other rapes that you did. 
 I didn't do seven other rapes. 
 It would have been eight if the old lady hadn't screamed. 
 No, sir. No. 
 There is a pocket missing. 
 There is? 
 You a lefty, or a righty? 
 Lefty. 
 Yeah, left pocket. 
 Naturally. 
 I don't see what you're getting at. 
 The oldest perv trick in the book. 
 "You want some change? 
 You want some candy? 
 It's in my pocket." 
 Only it's not coins or peppermints they find... it's your willy, Bruce. 
 No! 
 I keep my razor knife in my left pocket, it must have cut a hole. 
 Where's that knife now? 
 My tool kit. 
 Okay, Bruce, we're going to put you under arrest. 
 Well, we'll see how his story jives with the witnesses. 
 What, the older woman? 
 And the guy who wrestled him down. 
 Nobody looks at anybody on the subway, except for this guy... staring at this girl, boring holes in her. 
 Then he started to circle her. 
 On a full train? 
 He still had room to move, which is what got my attention. 
 Nobody moves on the subway until the train comes close to the station. 
 This guy had no reason to move. 
 So they were both standing? 
 He had his hands shoved deep in his pockets. 
 She was leaning up against a metal pole reading. 
 And then what happened? 
 The train jerked. 
 He grabbed hold of that metal pole so he wouldn't run into her. 
 Did he touch her? 
 As he "adjusted himself." 
 Was it the train throwing him up against her, or was it on purpose? 
 Who knows? 
 But when he bent his knees and started to rub up against her, that was on purpose. 
 What did she do? 
 Nothing! 
 That's why I said something, shouted it out to the whole car. 
 For all the times that I've stood there and taken it. 
 Enough, already. 
 Missed you at Columbus Circle. 
 Missed you, too. 
 Bruce Abbott, 41. Arrested today. 
 It's on the record. 
 What do you want from me? 
 Deep background. 
 Looks promising. 
 Is he the one? 
 People want to feel safe. 
 People should never let their guard down. 
 No, they shouldn't. 
 Chinese Wall. 
 Mushu? 
 Dim sum, 8:00. 
 Tell you the truth, I really didn't see much... not until I heard the old lady screaming. 
 She scream or say something? 
 At first all I heard her was saying, "Cut it out! Cut it out!" 
 But then she kept going on, "Somebody help!" 
 So I looked, and she points. 
 I see this guy on top of the girl. 
 On her, how? 
 On top of her, like pushing into her, you know. 
 So, I figure with everything going on, and the old lady yelling, this had to be the guy. 
 So I ran over there and put a nelson on him. 
 Full or half? 
 Full. 
 How is she doing, by the way? 
 She's been taken care of. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. You're welcome. 
 She says he never penetrated her. 
 I did a pelvic, and no signs of trauma. 
 Did you do a UV on the clothes? 
 We had our own little blacklight party and nothing. 
 She says nothing happened. 
 So she's in denial. 
 Maybe, or nothing happened. 
 Did he rub up against me? Yes. 
 Is that so different from any other day during rush hour? No. 
 Somebody's always touching you? 
 Half of riding in the subway is keeping your purse zipped, your pockets closed, your jacket buttoned. 
 What's the other half? 
 Keeping everybody else's hands in sight. 
 That's hard if you're reading. 
 No... you read a line, scan the car. 
 Read a line, scan the car. 
 And you mind your own business, which is what that lady should've done. 
 He didn't rape you? 
 No, he didn't even flash me. 
 That happened two weeks ago as we're pulling into Lexington Avenue. 
 What? 
 No matter how much they try to clean that subway up, they can't get rid of the smell. 
 Everybody's B.O., fast food. 
 I wish I had a Mustang and lived in the 'burbs. 
 Amen, sister. 
 I'm telling you, he didn't rape her. 
 I'm telling you, maybe he just didn't get the chance. 
 The seven other CW's? 
 We gotta bring 'em down here, each one, do a line up. 
 And how are we going to do that? 
 Each of these women was assaulted on public transit. 
 You going to let them take the train down here? 
 Good point. I mean... 
 Not our problem. 
 Really? 
 You think we should pick up each of these women and bring them down here personally? 
 Yeah, I do. Every time these women get on the train, if they still do, their anxiety level goes though the roof. 
 That's not a good state of mind to make an ID, which is our problem. 
 Maybe we could have the transit guys help us out on this... or not. 
 Let's bring 'em down here ourselves. 
 All seven. 
 All seven. 
 Like Ms. Jackson said, I want these seven ID's to go as smooth as possible. 
 Guess I'll still be taking cabs. 
 
 
 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 Number two. 
 Number two? 
 Number two's eyes... at least. 
 And his hands... looks like number four's. 
 Number four? 
 Yes. No. 
 I see parts of him everywhere... every man on the street. 
 Do you see him in there? 
 No... but I wish more than anything, that I did. 
 Yeah, number one. 
 I don't know, could be number four. 
 What if I'm wrong? 
 Well, then it becomes a trial issue. 
 Trial? 
 By then, we'll have the DNA results back. 
 The stuff on my dress. 
 So, it doesn't really matter if I'm right or wrong. 
 In fact, you don't really need me at all. 
 We need your ID to get an indictment in front of the grand jury. 
 Yes, but in front of a jury it doesn't matter, does it, what I see in here? 
 All that matters is that the stuff on my dress matches his "genetic material." 
 Yeah, but how that material got there, that's what's most important. 
 I don't see him. 
 You can always re-arrest him if the DNA tests ever match up. 
 That'll take a miracle. 
 They happen. 
 I'd rather re-arrest him on a lesser charge. 
 What, third-degree sexual misconduct for subway fondling? 
 Problem is, why would he cop to that if he's got a pass on the rapes? 
 Because he knows he's guilty. 
 So use it. 
 It's about time. 
 Your meter's running, what do you care about time? 
 My client can ill afford... 
 Shut up, Counselor. 
 Hi, I'm Audrey Jackson, I'm a court-appointed shrink. 
 How are you feeling? 
 I don't know. 
 Not that hot. 
 Okay, the police aren't going to charge you with the rapes. 
 They know you didn't do it. 
 I didn't think they believed me. 
 Well, they didn't, but that's their job. 
 You like riding subways, Bruce? 
 Yes. 
 The motion, you know. 
 It rocks you side to side, front to back. 
 It's soothing? 
 Yes. 
 Like, being in a womb? 
 Please, what's the point of all this blather? 
 To help him feel better. 
 That's my job. 
 Your job is to get him a better deal on a lesser charge of fondling. 
 I came here from South Dakota. 
 I was the geek, okay? 
 In a farming community. 
 I was "artistic," so I came to New York. 
 It was my dream. 
 Okay, what happened? 
 I don't know. 
 Everything just evaporated. 
 The other day, I got drunk. 
 I went to some porno place where they dance behind the window, and the next thing I knew, my face was against the glass, and I was weeping... for everything. 
 So, when you got on the subway, you had already relieved yourself? 
 So you weren't looking for s*x? 
 No, I just... 
 Just what, Bruce? 
 I was lonely... and I saw her... and then when I realized what I was doing, then I pulled back. 
 I just wanted... some contact. 
 Okay. 
 He's not violent. 
 Oh, really? He's carrying around a box cutter. 
 Yeah, to open boxes with, Captain. 
 Why don't you tell me why he's not the rapist, please? 
 Okay, look, you're looking for your classic power rapist... a guy who feels powerless, disenfranchised. 
 Yeah, right. My heart bleeds. 
 You asked my opinion. 
 He uses violence to gain control and then once he gets that control, he can use it to prove his virility. 
 Mm-hmm, and afterwards? 
 And afterwards, he goes back to feeling powerless. 
 That's why he wants to get caught. 
 This guy ran. 
 Right, he's not ready to get caught. 
 Barology 126 East 38th Street Wednesday, April 5 
 This... subway rapist? 
 Hold on, Nick, are we flirting or are we working? 
 We're always working. 
 Oh, so, you're not flirting? 
 No, I'm offering my undying love for the 10 millionth time. 
 Well, maybe tonight. 
 10 million and one, you may get lucky. 
 Really? 
 So, your subway rapist, maybe he's just trying to spread his seed. 
 Okay, why is he "my" subway rapist? 
 You're the one who's written over 300 inches about this guy. 
 And what are you saying, that if flowers and candy fail, then there's always one more alternative? 
 I'm not saying that. 
 Some people are saying that. 
 They're selling a lot of books. 
 I should write a book. 
 You should... you know these people. 
 No, I don't. 
 You do, that's why people move away from you on the sofa, Olivia. 
 You get inside s*x offenders. 
 Gee, how nice for me. 
 Well? 
 Well what? 
 I'm not moving away. 
 I can see that. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 We don't have to do this, you know. 
 I mean, it's fine. 
 You're the one that started it. 
 I know, and I want to. It's just... 
 It's just what? 
 s*x crimes, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 What, you're seeing what I see? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, you close your eyes, is that it? 
 To have s*x? 
 I have s*x with my eyes wide open. 
 Tell me what you see. 
 Let's not talk. 
 Okay, I just... 
 You just what? 
 I just want to... 
 Me too. 
 Let's pretend. 
 Pretend what? 
 That I'm the guy on the subway. 
 Okay, stop it. 
 Just for fun. 
 No, no. No, really, stop it. 
 What would you do? 
 Oh my God! 
 Wow! 
 I'm going to wash my face and my hands and my mouth and there's the door. 
 Make sure you're out when I get out of here, gone. 
 Hey. 
 Have a seat. 
 Yeah, I just wanted to... 
 It's uncanny. 
 What is? 
 How this reporter, this Nick Canzner, seemed to get right inside the head of the subway rapist. 
 Yeah, Captain, I want... 
 As if he got it straight from the horses mouth. 
 He's got quite a vivid imagination. 
 Is that all? 
 He was at my apartment, I asked him to leave and I turned my back. 
 Never turn your back on a reporter. 
 Believe me, I won't. 
 You want me to handle this? 
 No, I will. 
 Captain, there's been another rape. 
 The car's at the Delancey Street Station. 
 Unbelievable. 
 You and Jeffries. 
 Are we? 
 Delancey Street Subway Station Thursday, April 6 
 How's the woman? 
 She's like in shock. 
 She couldn't even speak. 
 They took her to the hospital. 
 Anything different? 
 One of the eyewitnesses grabbed the guy's coat and he said something fell out of the pocket, a card or something. 
 Where? 
 The stairs, on the platform. 
 Be my guest. 
 Nah, it's nothing. 
 You use the subway, why do you need a parking stub? 
 Commuter? 
 Queens, 6:50 a.m. Today. 
 Fresh lead. 
 Fresh, indeed. 
 Car's not here? 
 No, it's not. 
 This doesn't surprise you? 
 Uhhh... 
 Can I see your records? 
 So how does one claim a car without a ticket? 
 The policy is "lost ticket pays maximum." 
 It looks like this one was picked up a few hours ago. 
 Policy is "lost ticket, you keep maximum"? 
 I don't want to get fired. 
 Did you know this guy? 
 Always parks here. 
 Mm-hmm, what did he look like? 
 White. Skinny. Pointy nose. 
 What kind of car does he drive? 
 He drives a couple of different kinds... a van, a truck... but they're all from the same place. 
 A place where he works? 
 I guess so. 
 Dewell's. 
 Dewell's Painting Contractors. 
 Only one white guy... Sal Avelino. 
 How long has he been with you? 
 About a year. 
 Moved here from somewhere. 
 He's only part-time, not even that. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Because when he takes a car, you never know when he's going to come back. 
 Like this morning, he goes on a supply run, comes back three hours later. 
 I'm going to can his ass one of these days. 
 Does he go at the same time every day? 
 No, it depends on what the job is, what the errand is. 
 Few days ago, he goes on a lunch break, lasted all afternoon. 
 Well, maybe he drinks. 
 I drink. Him, it's something else. 
 He here now? 
 Should be. 
 Hey, Sal! 
 What? 
 Empty all your pockets, Picasso. 
 Can I get it back? 
 $12.36. 
 Can we voucher Mister Avelino's vast personal fortune, Detective? 
 I'm sorry, I'm just a house painter. 
 Yeah, so was Hitler... another impotent schlub who needed violence to get it up. 
 "Y" membership, credit card, driver's license. 
 Two driver's licenses. 
 Why two driver's licenses? 
 Mr. Avelino? 
 I found it, I was going to return it. 
 Yeah, but you forgot. 
 Who's Sidra Lonstein? 
 I don't know. 
 She's an organ donor. 
 Sal, who is she? 
 I don't know her. 
 Oh, that's right, you "found" it. 
 Where? 
 In the street. 
 Maybe on the job. 
 Or maybe in the subway. 
 We'll find out. 
 Now let's see what else we got. 
 Ooh, a metro card, a record of your travels. 
 Let's see where the day took you. 
 Ah, great. 
 What? 
 The system's frozen. 
 You call this doing your part? 
 It's ancient technology, what do you want from me? 
 The dates of the attacks, February 12th, March 19th, March 28th, April 11th... we need them! 
 Again, I ask you, what would you like me to do? 
 I'd like you to go sit on the third rail. 
 My client can't do a line-up right now. 
 He can rest between the IDs. 
 Okay, but he wants to be first in line. 
 You want to be number one, Sal? 
 Yeah. 
 What, is that your lucky number? 
 As a matter of fact, it is. 
 Okay, number one it is. 
 Good luck. 
 Number one. 
 I'm sorry, you'll have to wait until all five are present. 
 Number one. 
 Okay. 
 Now what? 
 We'll contact you about testifying. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Jen, you did great. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Forgot my scarf. 
 I'll get it. 
 How was it? 
 Don't... 
 Short and quick. 
 Like him. 
 That little b*st*rd. 
 Everybody stop! 
 Miss Calder, you can't... 
 I can't what? 
 Oh, great. 
 What did Jen say? 
 She said it was quick. 
 They can't talk. 
 What were you thinking? 
 It happened so fast. 
 You better start working on your reflexes, son! 
 Hey, in the street, I'm fine. 
 I got six women in there, they all start yakking at once. 
 Supreme Court Trial Part 80 
 Friday, April 7 
 Of course they identified my client. 
 They had prior knowledge he was in the line-up. 
 What was actually said, Your Honor, was that the process was quick. 
 "Like him." 
 Meaning your client. 
 Yes, Your Honor. 
 Which puts the others in a prejudicial state of mind. 
 But the absolute certainty with which the first rape victim identified her attacker, i.e. 
 Sal Avelino, has... 
 A specter of impropriety hangs over all the eyewitnesses. 
 And apart from their contaminated testimony, my client is linked to these appalling crimes by an unpaid parking stub. 
 Plus a metro card, and eight DNA samples. 
 Which, without those IDs doesn't mean anything except that they had s*x. 
 Exactly, Your Honor. 
 Your Honor, l... 
 Move to dismiss. 
 Case dismissed. 
 Consensual s*x with a stranger on the subway, holding a box cutter. 
 Now what what planet is this judge from? 
 Planet of the Apes. 
 Well, what about this woman, Sidra Lonstein? 
 She hasn't returned our calls and DMV hasn't issued her a new license yet. 
 Sal Avelino is well over 21, people... he doesn't need fake ID. 
 Seven months ago, all of her credit card numbers changed, so did her address. 
 So for all we know, she could be one of his victims. 
 And an uncontaminated complaining witness. 
 Could we be that lucky? 
 Why don't you take your partner and find out. 
 I'll go with you. 
 Where's Jeffries? 
 She's waiting to arrest him. 
 I see. 
 Detective, I want you to run this down for me, all right? 
 Thank you. 
 Help you? 
 Yeah, we're looking for Sidra, Sidra Lonstein? 
 Ah, Sidra. The cleaning lady with the Mona Lisa smile. 
 Is she around? 
 Nah, she's at work. 
 Where? 
 Subway... 34th Street Station. 
 That's five blocks from here. 
 Yeah, she always laughs about it. 
 She's gotta ride the subway to 96th Street, punch in, then back here, five blocks from her house. 
 Never complains though. 
 She must be a saint. 
 She is. 
 Nice article, Nicky. 
 Olivia, I was just going to call you. 
 Of course you were... right after I get reamed by my boss for letting you read a confidential police transcript. 
 You didn't let me read it... 
 I dug it up on my own. 
 I know you did, reporter's instinct. 
 Only problem, you see... my captain's not going to care about the details, so it looks like I screwed up. 
 Olivia, you're being too hard on yourself. 
 Yeah, why don't you save it? 
 Really. 
 What's this? 
 Read it. 
 It's a cold case. 
 You want a good story, you should check that out. 
 Philip Sternhagen. 
 Convicted of a strangulation/torture. 
 Who the hell is this? 
 A man with a rich fantasy life, who couldn't stop. 
 A man who uses women without the slightest twinge of regret. 
 Okay, okay. 
 A man like you, Canzner. 
 A man like you. 
 Anniversary? 
 Longest days of the year. 
 She's the one on the right. 
 Sidra? 
 I'm Detective Munch, this is Detective Stabler. 
 Hello, this is my friend, Kelli. 
 And is this your license? 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 How did you lose your license? 
 On the subway. 
 Some guy bumped into me. 
 You really don't have to go through all this trouble. 
 You've been on your feet all day, Miss Lonstein... it's not a problem, believe me. 
 We're all just civil servants here. 
 Oh, please. 
 I'm a janitor on the subway. 
 Well, but still, it's a tough job. 
 When are you due? 
 Eight or nine weeks. 
 I'm not really sure. 
 You know, I understand that. 
 Before my wife and I had our first child, I always thought, "nine months, 36 weeks. Boom." 
 But then it kind of turns out to be more like 10, depending on time of conception. 
 It's all a mystery. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Right. But in your case? 
 My case? 
 Your situation. 
 You told detectives that a man bumped into you on the subway? 
 What, about seven months ago? 
 Right. 
 And he took your wallet? 
 I guess so. 
 Oh, I'm so grateful you got my license back. 
 I needed to cash checks, even though I don't drive. 
 What kind of bump was it? 
 It was an accident. 
 The car was crowded. 
 Were you in uniform? 
 No, I was off-duty. 
 Were you wearing a dress? 
 Yes. 
 Why are you asking me these questions? 
 You know about the subway rapist, right, Sidra? 
 Yes. 
 You know how much damage he's done? 
 Not to me. 
 Okay, it's okay. It's just that we need your help. 
 We really do, Sidra. 
 Okay. 
 The man who came in contact with you... is it one of these men? 
 He's that man. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, thank you very much, Sidra. You hungry? 
 I don't think we have any ice cream and pickles here, but there is a machine and Detective Stabler can take you to it. 
 Take my arm, not my hand, because I'm working on a cold. 
 Okay. 
 We're going to go straight down here to the left. 
 Okay. 
 We got enough to pick him up, but... 
 She won't say rape, we don't get a conviction. 
 Then get him to say it. 
 Can I have some coffee? 
 No. 
 I have here a court order, signed by Judge Exner, to perform a amniocentesis on a complaining witness, Jane Doe number eight. 
 Amnio? For pregnant ladies? 
 That's right, you stick a needle into the womb and you get DNA from the unborn child. 
 Which we know to be yours. 
 You do? 
 Yup. 
 You're putting me on. 
 This is some kind of bluff, right? 
 You want to read it? It's technical, but what it means is, you were on that train, you lifted up those women's skirts, you were all ready to go, and you went! 
 The seven women who ID'd you... you got lucky. 
 But number eight, Sal, bad luck... you knocked her up. 
 Sidra, you feeling okay? 
 Fine. 
 You know, funny, so am I. 
 I've had a cold for a week. 
 You touched my hand and now it's gone. 
 Can you explain that? 
 No. 
 Yeah, neither can I. 
 Feed me something! 
 You'll get fed. 
 Yeah, but I haven't had anything in... 
 You. Is it you? 
 Elliot... wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 It is. 
 It's me. 
 Yeah, the girl in the flowered dress, right? 
 Tulips? Red and little yellow things, huh? 
 They said you were number eight or something. 
 I wondered if... 
 I wondered what happened, because I... 
 Because what, Sal? 
 Because I knew it, that when I did ya, that something beautiful could happen. 
 Yeah, that you'd get pregnant and you'd have my baby. 
 My baby. 
 Let's go. 
 When I get out, we'll be together, okay? 
 A family, a family, huh? 
 It's my baby. 
 It's my baby.
