 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 All right, people, listen up. 
 One Police Plaza's latest directive... bi-yearly psychological evaluations. 
 Bi-yearly for bipolars. 
 Toward this illustrious goal, they have picked one of the highest stress units as the lucky guinea pig for this pilot program. 
 Not us? 
 Us. 
 If you would please fill out this multiple choice form, you will be receiving your appointment times from our resident psychologist. 
 Any questions? 
 Will this go on our permanent record? 
 Everything will be confidential, John. 
 Yeah, but at the risk of sounding like John, what is their angle with this thing? 
 Can you flunk it? 
 And if so, then what happens? 
 I really don't know. 
 Okay, so... who goes first? 
 I do. 
 Blind leading the blind. 
 What do you want to bet they slapped a new cover on the old Minnesota Multiphasic? 
 Do you believe this? 
 Shrinks get shrunk. 
 Maybe we could use a little. 
 Hi. Can I help you? 
 Yes. They tell me to report s*x crime here. 
 Okay. Why don't you come have a seat right here? 
 Okay, go ahead, we're listening. 
 I have a fruit stand on Lex and 78th Street. 
 Out of nowhere two boys run up, grab bananas and take off. 
 That sounds like a robbery. 
 No, no. 
 You see, when I'm angry, I curse in my native tongue. 
 Which is what, Hungarian, Romanian? 
 Romanian. 
 And then this woman grabs me and begs me to help her. 
 Also in Romanian. 
 What was wrong? 
 A man... she's trapped in a situation she cannot escape from. 
 It does not translate well, but there is abuse. 
 Physical or sexual? 
 I think both. 
 What's her name? 
 She does not tell me that. 
 You know where she lives? 
 She does not tell that either. 
 She hands me this. 
 Constanta Condrescu. 
 She says, "Tell her she was right... 
 I need help." 
 And then she takes off. 
 What time did all this happen? 
 Three days ago. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x22 Slaves 
 Original air date : 2000/05/21 
 Big, big brown eyes. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Okay, let me see if I got this straight. 
 Some girl is being sexually abused by some guy somewhere in Manhattan. 
 Something like that. 
 Do we at least have a description? 
 We have the sketch artist working with the fruit vendor right now. 
 Well, what's your take on this guy? 
 Name is Mircha Cabrea. 
 Guy seems lucid enough. 
 Came to the States a few years back. 
 He's a fruit vendor. 
 Never been in trouble. 
 The only reason that he came in was to shut his wife up. 
 Apparently, he let the story slip and the wife wouldn't lay off until he did something about it. 
 Okay, assuming he's on the up-and-up, how do we know that the girl is? 
 Thousands of women are abused every day and never say a word about it. 
 We have to at least check it out. 
 What if Woodward and Bernstein had blown off "Deep Throat" as a prank phone call? 
 Prank call or not, it's three days cold now. 
 Apartment of Constanta Condrescu 207 West 95th Street Tuesdaym February 22 
 Sorry, I don't recognize her. 
 Constanta Condrescu is not a very common name. 
 What do you think the odds are that this girl would pull that name out of thin air? 
 She's my niece. 
 We're not close. 
 Are you close enough to know her name? 
 Llena. Ilena Condrescu. 
 Why did you lie to us about knowing her? 
 Where I come from, the less you tell police the better. 
 Where you come from, she's not in trouble, but she may be in trouble here. 
 And if she is, we'd like to help her. 
 Now, Ms. Condrescu... is this your niece? 
 Yes. 
 Do you mind if I borrow this? 
 Go ahead. It's of no use. 
 She reached out to you. 
 You must know where she is or who she's with. 
 I don't. I haven't seen her in three years... since she first came here. 
 And how did she get here? 
 On a student visa. 
 Which school? 
 NYU. 
 That's when we went our separate ways. 
 I'm sorry, but my shift starts soon. 
 Look, I'm going to give you my card. 
 If there's anything that you think of that may help us find her, please, give us a call. 
 We should have pressed her harder. 
 That woman is definitely holding something back. 
 We're not the Romanian Secret Police. 
 At least we got a name and a photo out of it. 
 Hey. It's Detective Stabler. 
 I want you to run a database check on an llena... l-L-E-N-A Condrescu. 
 No, C-O... Condrescu. 
 And if you don't get a hit, check NYU. Thanks. 
 Unless she flunked out or quit that's where she should be. 
 I'm going to get Munch on it. 
 No, she never showed up. 
 Does it mention why? 
 No. 
 Does it mention why somewhere? 
 Maybe in her application files? 
 Do you know how many tens of thousands of students apply to this university each year? 
 These are all student files. 
 So... this is what it feels like. 
 What does? 
 To be the suspect. 
 Just kidding. 
 Sort of. 
 Sit down. 
 Relax. 
 Yeah, right. 
 What, you can't relax? 
 I golf a little. 
 A little? 
 What's your handicap? 
 I don't know, 12, 14. 
 Must be difficult to get out to a course. 
 Well, it's a commitment, but I get out. 
 What else do you do for fun? 
 What do you mean "for fun"? 
 Tell me what you do to relax. 
 Go jogging? 
 Racquetball? 
 Walk? 
 Audrey, it's New York. 
 Everybody walks. 
 Don, come on, you see it every day. 
 Rape, murder, torture. 
 It's as sure as your morning cup of coffee. 
 And on top of that, you've got responsibilities of command. 
 I'm sorry, is that a question? 
 How well do you think you handle the stress? 
 I handle it. 
 All right, how do you handle it? 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Why don't you just come right out and ask me? 
 Ask you? 
 The question you've been tap-dancing around. 
 Do I get the urge to drink? 
 See, that's the problem with you people. 
 You ask about golfing, or jogging or whether a person was breast-fed or not... everything else under the sun. 
 Why don't you come right out and ask me about my alcoholism? 
 That's what this has all been about, hasn't it? 
 Do you want to talk about it? 
 No, I don't... but I will. 
 Yes. 
 I get the urge to drink... every day. 
 I see horrific acts of degradation, of brutality, of human evil. 
 They make me angry, they make me sick. 
 They get inside my head and I want to shut them up. 
 I know if I crawl inside of a bottle, they will stop. 
 Do you think you will? 
 Ask me tomorrow. 
 Sir, have you ever seen this woman before? 
 Excuse me. 
 What can I make you, pal? 
 You look like a wiener dog guy. 
 You don't know how wrong you are. 
 Have you ever seen this woman before? 
 Yeah, I seen her all the time. 
 Take a look, you positive? 
 Yeah. 
 Cute accent. Russian, Czech, something like that. 
 Do you know who she is? 
 Alls I know is, I made her a green ladybug. 
 Had her pegged as a red poodle type. Go figure. 
 Hey, balloon guy says he knows our girl. 
 Sir? 
  Yeah? 
 Excuse me. 
 You're sure that it was her? 
 I never forget a paying customer. 
 Except she's dropped a few pounds since that picture. 
 Yeah? You ever see her with anyone? 
 Make you a giraffe... on the house. 
 Have you ever seen her with anyone? 
 Of course, a little girl. 
 Eight or nine, excuse me. 
 Hey, here we go, kid. 
 Take another look. 
 This woman is 21 years old. 
 She couldn't possibly have an eight or nine-year-old. 
 Not her own. American. 
 You're in the heart of nanny central here. 
 Ka-ching... ah, you're a tough crowd. 
 When was the last time you saw her? 
 Yesterday. 
 Yesterday? 
 Yes. He even remembered her accent. 
 He also remembered her being serene. 
 She didn't strike him as being under the least bit of stress. 
 So three days ago she's slipping some fruit vendor an SOS. 
 Then a couple of days later, she's just strolling happily through the park with a kid. 
 So what, case closed? 
 No! 
 No, it is not closed. 
 Four of my top detectives just wasted an entire day on a wild goose chase. 
 That's 32 combined man hours. 
 I want this girl in here explaining herself. 
 Homicide just caught a dump job off the Henry Hudson. 
 Your card was in the victim's pocket. 
 The body was rolled up in a rug and dumped off the side of the parkway. 
 When? 
 The body, the rug, both are in great shape... minimum exposure to the elements. 
 So today? 
 Today, or probably some time last night. 
 Stabler : Any witnesses? 
 None that stopped. 
 Of course, no one would notice a body being hefted over the railing. 
 People dump stuff all the time. 
 Who found her? 
 A fisherman. 
 He though he found a nice little present for the wife. 
 So is this her? 
 Yeah, that's her. 
 Constanta Condrescu. 
 Something tells me she found a way to contact llena. 
 She was already dead when she hit the rug. 
 No fibers were inhaled. 
 So, what killed her? 
 Well, something stopped her heart... instantaneously. 
 What that something was, only toxicology will tell. 
 You got a time of death? 
 Between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. 
 We left her at 4:00. 
 Only an injection directly into the bloodstream would cause an attack this acute without affecting other organs. 
 The thing is, I cannot for the life of me find a puncture wound. 
 You check the white-collar junkies' hiding places? 
 Nothing between the toes, behind the knees, or in the genitals. 
 What about under the tongue? 
 For an accidental OD, that would make sense, but... it would be very difficult, if not impossible for a killer to... 
 How did the killer inject her under the tongue without signs of a struggle? 
 He had to have sedated her. 
 But it still doesn't play. 
 She hears that her niece is in trouble, beelines to this guy and has a friendly, albeit spiked, drink with him? 
 I guess so, because two hours after we gave her this message, she's dead. 
 We should have pressed her harder. 
 I took the liberty of contacting lnterpol. 
 The victim's brother... 
 Ilena's father... was also murdered back in Romania. 
 When? 
 '89, during the Ceausescu regime. 
 That's an big gap for a connection, don't you think? 
 Not when you consider the timing. 
 People assume that the good guys overthrew Ceaucescu. 
 But it was "Hello new boss, same as the old boss." Big time. 
 Maybe the Condrescu family knew where the bodies were buried. 
 Whatever happened to these two women started there. 
 All roads lead to Romania. 
 That may be so, John, but what do you say we start in Murray Hill? 
 Look at this. 
 She didn't even finish her tea. 
 I don't think she was killed here, but let's bag it up before we leave. 
 Got an address book. 
 It's open to the "C's!" 
 Please tell me we have an address for llena Condrescu. 
 No, but the page where it would fall alphabetically is missing. 
 Okay. Let's keep looking. 
 You guys in here? 
 No! 
 Canvass of the first floor was a colossal wash. 
 Not many people home. 
 Lady in 1-D, though, vaguely remembers the victim. 
 She never saw the niece. 
 Maybe you'll have luck with her work. 
 We'll take it from here. 
 Cafe Prahova. 
 Soviet bloc ex-patriots plotting coup d'etats over bowls of goulash? 
 My partner. 
 No, her niece never came to the restaurant. 
 Had they been in contact at all? 
 No. 
 There had been a big fight when llena first got here. 
 About? 
 How she got here. 
 Constanta was saving to help her come to school, but it was going to take another year. 
 Out of the blue, llena shows up. 
 Really? How did she manage that? 
 She met an American businessman at a discotheque in Bucharest. 
 She told him her story and he offered to help. 
 I assume there was a catch? 
 Well, so did Constanta. 
 She yelled at llena for being so naive. 
 She said, "Of course there would be a catch." 
 Llena started crying, said the ticket didn't cost him anything, it was frequent flyer, and that he knew of a part-time job. 
 She said he was just a nice man. 
 Do you know what this man's name was? 
 No. Just that he was American. 
 Do you think that's where llena went? 
 Constanta assumed so. 
 She tried to contact the man who gave her the ticket, but he said he'd never heard from her. 
 She tried back a few more times, but nothing. 
 Finally, she gave up. 
 Thanks. 
 Now, you requested to be assigned to SVU. 
 Why don't you tell me about that? 
 That question on your form, "Has anybody in your family ever been the victim of a rape?" 
 I checked yes. 
 I'm actually the child of a rape. 
 How do you think that affects you on your job? 
 I'm walking a tightrope. 
 I got too close to a case once. 
 A Serbian rapist was killed by his victims... and I got my ass in a sling over it. 
 But has it interfered with your ability to remain objective? 
 No. 
 You had occasion to use deadly force a few months ago. 
 My partner was about to be shot. 
 It was a reflex. 
 That's what we're trained to do. 
 Okay. 
 Say you couldn't be a s*x crimes detective anymore, what would you be? 
 Hey, sorry I'm late. 
 How did it go? 
 Cake walk. 
 What do you got? 
 It's a Persian Kashan. 
 A more expensive rug than you'd normally find in dump jobs. 
 Yeah? How much? 
 Runs around $5,000. 
 A perp with serious money, huh? 
 Or he killed her in a carpet store. 
 You pull anything out of it? 
 Your standard particles of dirt, cotton, nylon fibers... 
 Anything place or person specific? 
 A human hair. 
 Root intact. 
 Victim's? 
 No, definitely not. 
 No proof it's the doer's. 
 But I'd sure like a suspect to compare it to. 
 Air Bucharest Executive Offices 248 East 54th Street Wednesday, February 23 
 Ilena Condrescu. 
 Someone gave her a free ticket... frequent flyer. 
 I'm sorry, when did she fly? 
 August of '97. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 Don't answer that phone. 
 Anyone who calls an airline sits on hold 20 minutes, minimum, while being subjected to a Clockwork Orangian repetitive loop on the benefits of your awards program. 
 I believe that's your phone, sir. 
 Munch. 
 Out of Romania i nto JFK, maybe. 
 Someone gave llena a ticket to come here... someone her aunt warned her had ulterior motives. 
 We're trying to find out who. 
 Got it. 
 Got it. 
 And the frequent flyer is? 
 Randolph Morrow. 
 Randolph Morrow. 
 Hold for the address. 
 Hello? 
 Can I help you? 
 Llena? 
 I'm Detective Benson, this is my partner, Detective Stabler. 
 Ilena, it's okay. 
 We're here to help you. 
 We got your message. 
 What message? 
 To your aunt. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Who's here? 
 No. Mr. And Mrs. Morrow have been very good to me. 
 Where are the Morrows right now? 
 At work. And dinner has to be ready before they get home. 
 Is there anything else? 
 Yes, there's a lot more. 
 Ilena, come and play with me. 
 Ilena... your aunt was murdered an hour after we informed her that you were in trouble. 
 I don't know anything about it. 
 I've told you I never gave anyone a message like that. 
 Why would someone make something like that up? 
 I don't know! 
 All right. Regardless of who sent the message, we know your aunt came to see you. 
 I haven't seen her in three years. 
 Mr. Morrow really doesn't like dinner to be late. 
 Please. 
 We're very sorry for your loss. 
 Ilena. 
 You were supposed to start NYU three years ago. 
 Why didn't you? 
 You should have seen her when we told her her aunt had been murdered. 
 Nothing. Not a blink. 
 Stepford nanny. 
 The only time she registered at all on the emotional chart was at the thought of dinner being late. 
 It's the Stockholm syndrome. 
 Brainwashing? 
 1973, four hostages were taken during a botched bank robbery attempt in Stockholm, Sweden. 
 When the SWAT team tried to rescue them, they actively resisted. 
 After only six days of captivity. 
 And when they were finally rescued, they not only refused to testify against their captors, but they helped raise money for their legal defense. 
 Are you saying we have another Patty Hearst on our hands? 
 It doesn't take as much as you think to brainwash a person. 
 Isolation, threats of death, violence, and then random acts of kindness. 
 In as little as 72 hours, a person's psyche can be completely broken down. 
 Ilena's been there three years. 
 If that's what really happened to her, she's not gonna be of any help. 
 You gotta get back there and find out what's going on in that house. 
 
 
 
 Do you have a girlfriend? 
 Do you? 
 Have you dated at all since transferring to this unit? 
 Ah, now I see where you're going with this. 
 Does dealing with sexual deviants every day affect me? 
 The answer is no. 
 Just ask my blowup doll. 
 Do you think that this job has had any effect on your s*x life? 
 No, but I think I've pinpointed what has. 
 Believe it or not, I have serious intimacy issues. 
 I'm critical and negative. 
 I have an occasional bout of... let's see, melancholy? 
 I'm a lousy date, but a good cop. 
 So, I guess that just about covers everything. 
 Uh, no. Actually, we have 45 minutes. 
 So I suppose you want to hear a detailed account of my sexual history? 
 But how are we going to kill the remaining 44 minutes? 
 Do you always deflect personal questions with jokes? 
 Do you always deflect jokes with personal questions? 
 Have you ever experienced any sexual dysfunction since taking this job? 
 And I'd appreciate a serious answer. 
 Once. 
 Thank you. 
 When did that happen? 
 I'm not sure, but definitely within the last 10 minutes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, I'm not good at talking about me. 
 You're the expert, why don't you talk about me? 
 Okay. 
 You've been married multiple times. 
 Each wife was beautiful, spoiled, and not one of them matched you intellectually. 
 You distrust all women, any form of government, and you could smell conspiracy at a five-year-old's lemonade stand. 
 Anything else? 
 You've given up on relationships. 
 But you still believe in true love. 
 And the pain of never having found it is unbearable. 
 Anything else? 
 Good neighbors. 
 Decent, loving parents. 
 Has llena ever talked to you about the Morrows? 
 Actually, we've never really had a conversation with her. 
 I guess it sounds awful. 
 She's been here a year. 
 She's a very quiet girl. 
 You said she's been here just a year? 
 Yeah, about. 
 We heard she'd been here three years. 
 No, one at the most. 
 I'm sure. 
 What do you guys know about the Morrows? 
 She's a veterinarian. 
 Anyone who helps animals is all right in my book. 
 And Mr. Morrow? 
 A corporate type. 
 An investment banker, I think. 
 Sit. 
 The couch is much more comfortable. 
 Oh, I'm fine. 
 Ilena told me about her aunt. 
 It's tragic. We didn't even know she had a relative here. 
 So, I don't know what help I can be. 
 We never met. 
 You never met llena's aunt? 
 No, sir. 
 How did you meet llena? 
 I was in Romania consulting on some privatization issues. 
 A nightmare. 
 Ilena wanted to come to the States, we needed a nanny. 
 If only all mergers were that easy. 
 She's been with you three years? 
 Yeah, I guess it has been. 
 Listen, that chair is really so stiff. 
 Your neighbors said that they've only noticed llena this past year. 
 My neighbors? 
 Well, this is New York. 
 I don't think I could tell you anything about any of my neighbors. 
 They're very observant. 
 And they're positive that llena's only been with you this past year. 
 Can you explain that? 
 Louise? 
 Yes, sir. 
 What did we discuss about the blinds? 
 You like them drawn halfway during the afternoon. 
 And what time is it now? 
 3:30, Mr. Morrow. 
 Could you adjust them, please? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Could you do that now, Louise? 
 Thank you. 
 I have an afternoon full of meetings. 
 Is there anything else? 
 Yeah, one question. 
 Where were you Monday between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.? 
 I was in negotiations with four corporate lawyers. 
 I thank you for your time. 
 You got something on your suit. 
 The guy was a real sweetheart, right? 
 That couch was comfortable. 
 And by the way, nice move with the hair plucking. 
 You enjoyed that? 
 Yep. 
 We'll match it up with the one we found in the rug. 
 Stabler. 
 Good, what do you got? 
 What's that? 
 Thanks a lot. 
 What? 
 Toxicology just came back. 
 Constanta was killed with Beuthanasia. 
 It's what they use to put animals to sleep. 
 Morrow Veterinary Clinic 260 East 76th Street Thursday, February 24 
 Come on, sweetie. 
 Mrs. Morrow, we understand that you work Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
 Where were you last Monday? 
 Home. 
 Did llena have any visitors that day? 
 No. 
 Did your husband come home at any point? 
 No. 
 Barry, can I have some help here? 
 Sure, Dr. Morrow. 
 How're things working out with llena? 
 Oh, it works. 
 We have a routine. 
 My husband can explain it better. 
 Dropped it. 
 Do you and llena get along? 
 My husband selected her... to help me. 
 Barry. 
 How close is your husband to llena? 
 You should talk to my husband. 
 Dr. Morrow, we have a hit and run. 
 I should go. 
 Barry, can you? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a very nice facility you have here. 
 Yup, we got our own O.R. and recovery rooms. 
 Pharmacy? 
 Yeah, it's just down the hall there. 
 It's all computerized, I suppose, so the DEA can monitor you? 
 The monitoring's not as stringent as with humans. 
 Not too many poodles become crackheads. 
 How 'bout the vets? 
 Look, I really have to do a rectal, so... 
 Sure, by all means. 
 I'll tell you what, you give us a call if you think of anything else you want to tell us. 
 Sure. 
 I see you were recently injured in the line of duty. 
 Why don't you tell me what happened. 
 Sure. I was in a foot pursuit of a rape suspect, when the car he stepped into just blew to high heaven. 
 So you were only a step or two to going with him? 
 Sometimes after encountering a near death experience, an officer can get tentative. 
 Maybe just a split-second hesitation before pulling a weapon. 
 Nope, nope, nothing like that at all. 
 No? 
 No. 
 Actually, I've never felt more confident. 
 How so? 
 Well, I always knew that this day might come and I always wondered what would happen. 
 Well, the day came and I walked away from it. 
 I feel alive, you know, clear... like three shots of espresso without the jitters. 
 Are you presently in a relationship? 
 I had been in a long term relationship, but when I started working here, that pretty much ended. 
 So did dating in general, actually. 
 I guess... 
 I've been celibate... well, up until... actually, up until the accident. 
 So you're dating again? 
 A lot. 
 I guess the whole thing made me realize how short life is. 
 You've met a man? 
 Well, not a man... different men. 
 I don't know, I guess I feel restless. 
 What is it? 
 Hmm, oh, nothing. 
 No, you were going to say something. 
 No, no, it's nothing. 
 Well, a few nights ago I was at this bar, and there was this guy and he was watching me... staring at me. 
 And? 
 And we started dancing. 
 And I thought I recognized him from someplace, but I couldn't place it. 
 It's dark in the bar, so when we got outside under the streetlight, it finally hit me where I recognized this guy from. 
 And who was he? 
 A guy I'd been watching a year earlier on a case. 
 We liked him for a suspect. 
 What'd you do? 
 I went home with him. 
 Hey. Hey, you all right? 
 Yeah, why wouldn't I be? 
 I don't know, the psych exam? 
 Dr. Ciggles had me wanting to eat my gun. 
 No. No, I'm fine. 
 Monique. 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah, what? 
 I'm looking for detectives Benson or Stabler. 
 So had the inventory been fudged? 
 Vets are under a lot of pressure, so when tranquilizers like Valium or Ketamine go missing, it's just the nature of the business. 
 But? 
 Beuthanasia's another thing entirely. 
 So did Mrs. Morrow take some from the animal hospital? 
 Yeah. 
 A few months ago. 
 I couldn't figure out why. 
 The stuff's lethal. 
 You sure it's Beuthanasia? 
 Yeah. The stuff's bright pink. 
 There's no mistaking it. 
 You took a lethal drug home from work? 
 The same lethal drug that killed Constanta. 
 That was for me. 
 Why? 
 Because your husband was having s*x with llena right under your nose? 
 Sexuality is about reaching our limits and transcending them. 
 So did your husband transcend llena's aunt? 
 Is that what happened? 
 She confronted him, he killed her? 
 No. 
 We understand you want to protect your husband. 
 That woman... showed up at the door, threatened him, threatened our routine. 
 I knew what I had to do. 
 And what was that? 
 I calmed her down. 
 I gave her tea. 
 You drugged her. 
 With an injection of Beuthanasia as a chaser? 
 Your idea or your husband's? 
 It's like putting an animal down. 
 You have to disassociate. 
 Mrs. Morrow, did your husband tell you to kill Constanta? 
 He didn't have to tell me anything. 
 Police! 
 Last chance! 
 You smell that? 
 Upstairs. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You have no right to be in here. 
 Exigent circumstances. 
 Your lawyer will explain it to you. 
 Elliot. 
 Yeah? 
 Look at this. 
 We're going to need warrants for those. 
 Let's at least get him out of here. 
 Where is she? 
 She's gone. 
 She's not coming back. 
 Ilena?! 
 Ilena?! Ilena?! 
 Ilena can you hear us? 
 Llena? 
 Olivia! 
 Get me something. 
 We've got a padlock. 
 That's good. 
 Where is she? 
 Who? 
 The girl you're torturing in all those photos. 
 Honey, I'd like a mineral water, no ice. 
 And I'd like your balls in a blender, but ain't life a bitch? 
 I said it would be all right if you keep me company while I waited for my attorney, but perhaps I'll have a little quiet time now. 
 I've got some typing to catch up on. 
 Maybe you shouldn't have called her honey. 
 Women. 
 I've been trying to break her in for a long time now. 
 I'd recommend the rack. 
 Sounds painful. 
 It's excruciating. 
 You have to be careful, though, you can cut off circulation, cause permanent damage. 
 Is that so? 
 It has to be consensual. 
 Like it is with llena. 
 Mr. Morrow's attorney is here. 
 Why is the detective talking to my client after he invoked his right to counsel? 
 It's all right, Terrence, we were just discussing our common interests. 
 Now, let's get me home in time for dinner. 
 It gets worse. 
 The hair sample from the rug? 
 Not his... it's the wife's. 
 We need that warrant now. 
 Let's go. What'd you get from Morrow? 
 She's still alive. 
 Yeah? 
 He used the present, not past tense when talking about her. 
 "She is," not "was." 
 Now, we've got to find her. 
 Yeah. Before she dies. 
 How do we know these pictures exist? 
 The detectives saw them. 
 How and where did they see them? 
 When they entered the suspect's residence looking for the girl. 
 Without a warrant? 
 Exigent circumstances. Your honor. 
 They had every reason to believe this woman was in imminent danger. 
 And was she? 
 It turned out that she wasn't on the premises. 
 But they found evidence indicating that she had been held there against her will and that she had recently been moved. 
 On this basis, we should... 
 Please. 
 New York is the home of more discipline and bondage shops than you can crack a whip at. 
 Whips and chains do not necessarily denote non-consensual acts. 
 Are you kidding me, Your Honor? 
 Any idiot can see this woman is being held against her will... 
 You are very close to contempt, Counsel. 
 Judge, we need to get into this apartment. 
 You don't have probable cause, so you want me to give you a warrant so you can get probable cause, is that it? 
 Nice try. 
 All rise. 
 She's still detoxing. 
 And what was she on? 
 Ketamine. 
 It's an animal tranquilizer. 
 On the street it's known as Special K. 
 We're familiar with it. 
 In veterinary circles, it's known as the addiction of choice. 
 And hers was pretty long term. 
 I already told you everything. 
 We're not here for your crime, we're here for your husband's. 
 My husband didn't do anything wrong. 
 Mrs. Morrow, he kidnapped and tortured that girl. 
 He disciplined her. 
 He helped her learn. 
 Did you know that she was missing? 
 You're gone, she's gone... and I guess he's all alone now, except for your daughter. 
 And all of his toys. 
 He treats Tamara like a princess. 
 She's his daughter. 
 Adopted daughter. She's not even his own flesh and blood. 
 No, he wouldn't. 
 You know he can't let that closet stay empty. 
 Who's the next logical choice? 
 Forget logic, who's convenient? 
 You know he's going to do it. 
 He did it to you, didn't he? 
 Didn't he? 
 He was so... good to me at first. 
 And then he started asking me to do things. 
 So you let him hurt you. 
 I wanted to escape so many times, but I was so afraid for our daughter. 
 So you stayed, hoping that things would change, but they didn't, did they? 
 Until he abducted llena. 
 Like he said, it was so perfect. 
 A woman just in the United States and nobody would even know she existed. 
 He kept her chained in a closet for the first six months. 
 Yeah, except to rape and torture her. 
 You have no idea... what I went through. 
 That's why you never did anything for llena... because he stopped doing it to you. 
 All right, you're going to help us. 
 How easy was it to roll his wife? 
 Like dice down the shoot. 
 That's gotta hurt. She was your number one submissive, wasn't she? 
 She'll never testify against me. 
 She will. 
 We control her now. 
 She doesn't even blink without my permission. 
 She blinked. 
 See, that's where you screwed up, Chuck. 
 You broke her down too much. 
 You made her too plyable. 
 You made it easy for us. 
 Most wives'd go to the electric chair for their husbands, but not yours. 
 You really screwed up. 
 Your power is gone, my friend. 
 We took your control. 
 I control llena. 
 She doesn't eat, sleep, or urinate without my permission. 
 I control her. I do. 
 Do you like beating up women? 
 Huh, tough guy? Stand up. 
 Sit down. 
 Stand up. Stand up! 
 Sit down! Sit down! 
 Now who controls who? 
 We've been forcing every move you've made. 
 Once we start you running, it's "Screw Up City," pal. 
 You have never forced a move out of me! 
 Oh, really? We forced you to move llena, didn't we? 
 And what about this one? 
 No, that's the bathroom off the master suite. 
 Look at these welts on her back. 
 Olivia? 
 Did he break? 
 No, but I think he tipped his hand. 
 We're sure all of these pictures were taken in the house? 
 I think so, except for this one. 
 This is the only one I can't place. 
 There's no point of reference for location in it. 
 Just that corner of rug near the opening. 
 It's the rug Constanta was rolled in. 
 Where's the confession from his wife? 
 She took it out of the bedroom. 
 Been there the whole time. 
 That's impossible, the cops have been all over that place. 
 There ain't nowhere else but here. 
 Ilena, talk to us. 
 Where are you? 
 It's got to be the bed. 
 Let's go. Ready to go? 
 Llena, can you hear us? 
 Olivia, Olivia. 
 What've you got? 
 I've no idea what I've got. 
 What's that? Something there. 
 Come on, baby! 
 Come on! 
 Elliot, there's something. 
 Pull this. 
 Pull it. 
 Oh, my God. 
 She's alive. 
 Can you hear us? 
 Call an ambulance! 
 It's okay, sweetheart. 
 This is Stabler, 321 West 101. 
 I need an ambulance, now. 
 321 West 101st. 
 It's okay. 
 Tell him I didn't do anything. 
 I didn't make a sound, I swear! 
 I didn't do anything. 
 It's okay, we're getting you out of here. 
 Ilena, it's over. 
 I didn't do anything! 
 It's over. 
 Audrey : How long does a case like this stay with you? 
 A while. 
 How do you deal with it? 
 I go home, hug my kids, kiss my wife. 
 Can you discuss the cases at home? 
 No, no, I don't let that world touch my family. 
 But that world is everywhere. 
 You can't put them on 24-hour surveillance. 
 True, but it doesn't mean I have to be their window into it. 
 You have to work with a lot of cases involving children. 
 You think that hits a little close to home for you? 
 You ever see a child with no soul? 
 I have. 
 How do you handle it? 
 I think... 
 I think a lot. 
 About? 
 The crime. The victim. 
 The people that do that sort of thing. 
 What else? 
 How I could get away with killing them. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Yeah. Come on in. 
 How goes the witch-hunt? 
 Well, I've seen everybody. 
 You find any bed-wetters or cross-dressers? 
 No. 
 No, I found a commensurate level of stress and neurosis that one would expect in this field of work. 
 For the most part. 
 For the most part? 
 The purpose of this program is to identify detectives that are perilously close to a meltdown. 
 It's not to punish them, but to protect the public from them as well as themselves. 
 You can't be saying that you found somebody at that stage in my unit. 
 I did. 
 And I'm afraid I have to recommend that they be removed from duty... immediately. 
 Who?
