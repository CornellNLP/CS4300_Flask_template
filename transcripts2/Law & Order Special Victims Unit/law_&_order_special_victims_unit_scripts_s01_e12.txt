 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 Andrew? 
 Andrew, are you home? 
 Or are you out whoring? 
 Mommy, please. 
 Daddy? 
 God! No! 
 Daddy! 
 Oh, Mom! 
 Was anyone else with you besides Emily when you discovered your husband? 
 No. I had taken my son down... at his loft in Tribeca. 
 He was out at the Hamptons for a bachelor party, and he hitched a ride home with us. 
 You were with your mom the whole weekend? 
 Yeah. 
 Not that I wanted to be. 
 She is such a bitch. 
 Daddy wanted a divorce, but she didn't. 
 How come? 
 She wanted to be Mrs. Andrew Harlin. 
 Is there anybody you know of who would want to hurt your husband? 
 Define "hurt." 
 Sorry. 
 Yeah, take your pick. 
 Good old days. 
 Let's see. 
 Oh, no, not him. 
 This one I recognize. 
 He used to deliver pizza to us until then he just kind of... delivered. 
 So your husband was gay? 
 What's more than bisexual? 
 How's... compulsively orgasmic? 
 Let's say he was polymorphously perverse. 
 Which is to say that he would have s*x with... a plant. 
 Do you think there was a reason that the killer sodomized your husband with a banana? 
 He was allergic to bananas. 
 He... he used to get all covered in hives. 
 I've got to call my son Adam. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x12 Russian Love Poem 
 Original air date : 2000/01/20 
 Yeah, whoever, whatever. 
 They still didn't have to shove a banana where the sun don't shine. 
 That's just rude. 
 I don't get why she stayed if she knew. 
 I know this guy. 
 I mean, like we went to school or something. 
 I'm just saying it was disrespectful, not homicidal. 
 Pretty symbolic. 
 I'll say. 
 I know where John's going with this. 
 Whoever inserted the banana... 
 Knew Harlin was allergic. 
 He/she might not have meant to kill him. 
 It's hard to get an allergic reaction out of a dead man. 
 So, was it premeditated or a s*x game gone wrong? 
 And why are we so positive the wife is clean? 
 She has an alibi and I don't think Emily would lie to protect her. 
 I'm positive, like, I hung out with this guy. 
 We were good friends or something. 
 This may explain the widow's good mood. 
 I spoke to one of Harlin's lawyers. 
 She and the kids split all his assets, which currently stand at north of 100 million. 
 I suppose she could have been nervous about somebody getting added to the list. 
 But I gotta tell you, I wasn't getting that vibe from her. 
 She wasn't hiding anything. 
 And no crocodile tears. 
 Here's a thought. Let's see what the pretty boys and girls have to say. 
 Jeffries, I want you to pull all of Harlin's records, bills, anything. 
 You guys talk to the son. 
 See if he knows anything about the old man's dating habits. 
 And let's try to reconstruct this family's affairs. 
 Apartment Of "Bull Dozer" 
 515 West 22nd Street Monday, September 6 
 So, did we go to school together or something? 
 You from Ypsilanti? 
 No, I'm not, but I swear to God I know you. 
 I swear I know this guy. 
 No, I'd remember. 
 Maybe you know me from my commercials. 
 My banana spot's still running. 
 That's it. The banana spot. 
 What's your real name? 
 Bull Dozer is my real stage name. 
 Ah, the nom d'amour. 
 Don't I look the part? 
 I'm gonna make it. 
 You're really in p0rn? 
 No, not yet. 
 But soon, very soon. 
 I just do these cheesy commercials for the money, but I was born to be in p0rn. 
 And I'm still looking for a good p0rn talent agent if you happen to know of anyone. 
 Maybe somebody that you picked up or something. 
 So, Mr. Dozer, hey, Mr. Dozer! 
 You were saying you ended your relationship with Andrew. 
 Why? 
 Because he didn't pay for the last seven dinners. 
 He gave me nothing. 
 All he wanted to do was have s*x. 
 And we were both a top so that didn't really work out. 
 Andrew gave you some presents though, didn't he? 
 He lent me... these, to practice on. 
 Is the wife going to need these back? 
 Because I'll keep 'em. 
 I kinda doubt she's gonna even notice they're missing. 
 Apartment Of Adam Harlin 27 Laight Street Monday, September 6 
 Did you call your mother after she dropped you off? 
 No. We spent three hours in the car on Sunday. 
 That's enough for three years. 
 Traffic sucks on Sunday. 
 I was late for a friend's gig. 
 Were you and your father close? 
 Yeah, very close. 
 Till he started doing my girlfriends. 
 Then our relationship got a little sour. 
 Let's talk about your joint girlfriends. 
 Nothing to talk about. 
 Once he touched 'em, I dumped 'em. 
 Anybody recently? 
 Becky. 
 Becky have a last name? 
 Sorenson. 
 She's a painter. 
 Lives in NoHo. 
 Adam's just young. 
 He thinks small. 
 And Daddy? 
 Nothing small about Daddy. 
 Andrew was something else. 
 Kinky. 
 Enthusiastic. 
 He did things to your body that aren't even in the Kama Sutra. 
 Wow. So what happened? 
 Nothing. 
 We just moved on. 
 Andrew had a very short but intense attention span. 
 How short? 
 Two weeks. 
 Any hard feelings? 
 I think you're thinking about this the wrong way. 
 How so? 
 Andrew wasn't into monogamy. 
 Not even serial monogamy. 
 Do you know any of these men? 
 No. 
 God, that's Charlie Poe. 
 We chartered a boat a bunch of times. 
 Andrew and Charlie? 
 He chartered the boat a couple of times. 
 We know you two had a sexual relationship. 
 Look. You see this? 
 That's my family. I'm straight. 
 Really? 
 I... I don't... I'm not attracted to the male gender in any way. 
 See that? You and Andrew make a great couple. 
 And we have a few others where you're wearing only your birthday suit. 
 I never did anything, I swear. It wasn't me. 
 If you tell my wife... 
 We won't, unless it's absolutely necessary. 
 You know what it costs to put a kid through school today? 
 I mean, even nursery school? 
 Yeah, so Andrew liked o sleep with me a few times. 
 But that's it. I never did anything. He did. 
 In exchange, he helped me out with my kids' education. 
 How often did you two fellas tie each other up? 
 You mean bondage? 
 Yeah, bondage. 
 Sometimes. 
 Did he ever have you tie him up? 
 No. He liked to keep me still. 
 See, I'm very ticklish. 
 People say it's tension, but I'm ticklish even when I'm relaxed. 
 So I moved around a lot and he didn't want me to... 
 Okay, terrific. 
 Let me ask you a question. 
 Do you know any of the other guys? 
 What other guys? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I was the only one. 
 No, no. No, this was the first time for both of us. 
 That's why... 
 Nobody fits. 
 So all their records are clean? 
 Yep. 
 No motives, no angry breakups. 
 Not even the pizza guy. 
 For a 50 year old, this Harlin sure had a lot of energy. 
 What is that supposed to imply? 
 Nothing. I'm sure you and John have just as much. 
 Check this out. 
 Looks like Mr. Kink Calore spent more dough on girls than boys. 
 A lot of lingerie. 
 40 grand alone last year. 
 But you know, it could have been for the boys. It's difficult to tell. 
 This guy was truly horny. 
 Fingerprint was found in the study. 
 Belongs to a Sonya Pietrovicz. 
 Russian woman. 
 She's off the boat three years ago. 
 Green card. 
 Occupation listed as gulyashaya deyavca. 
 Every sailor knows that's Russian for hooker. 
 The Turkins Bath 143 East 8th Street Thusday, September 7 
 I understand if you don't want to strip, but you must take off... your shoes. 
 Sonya's been gone a few weeks. 
 She met Victor. 
 She says she's in love. 
 He's getting rich. 
 He owns Ecstasy. 
 Ecstasy? 
 The hottest spa in Manhattan. 
 There's a three month waiting list for a facial. 
 He's going to make millions, the b*st*rd. 
 I gave her a good job. Masseuse. 
 And she left me for that pig Victor. 
 I thought she was different from the others. 
 Different how? 
 She'll never find love. 
 It's not a natural thought process for her. 
 She treats men like she's a whore. 
 Is she? 
 A whore in America is just a hooker. 
 In Russian it's different. 
 Whores are at the top of the social scene and everyone respects them, but they rarely fall in love. 
 When they do, you'd want to be there. 
 I've been in America a long time and American girls fall in love so easily. 
 So I don't really give a damn where she is now. 
 His shoes? 
 He's allowed. 
 I know that guy from somewhere. 
 Probably Carnegie Hall. 
 He's a famous violinist from the Moscow Philharmonic. 
 No, the guy in the water. 
 A good friend. 
 A respectable businessman. 
 Ecstasy Spa 760 Fifth Avenue Thusday, September 7 
 Facial or waxing? 
 No, l... 
 Is this your first time here? 
 Detective Olivia Benson. 
 This is Detective Stabler. 
 We need to speak with Sonya Pietrovicz. 
 Sonya doesn't work here anymore, but go to room six. 
 Natasha's there. 
 They were friends. 
 But you're going to have to go alone, sorry. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm with a client. 
 Are you Natasha? Yes. 
 May I have a moment of your time? 
 Sure. I'll be right back. 
 So Sonya Pietrovicz was a friend of yours? 
 Why? Is she in trouble? 
 Maybe. 
 Her Mafia boyfriend already screwed her over? 
 And he would be? 
 Yuri. He got her the singing job. 
 Look, I thought she and I were friends. 
 We lived together for a while. 
 We went to Brighton Beach for good food. 
 Didn't she used to date the owner here? 
 Victor? 
 Everybody dates him. 
 That's how you get a job. 
 Do you know if she had an American boyfriend, Andrew Harlin? 
 Married? 
 Andrew? Maybe. 
 She met a lot of men. 
 That's why we're not friends anymore. 
 Listen, we both went for an audition at nightclub and we both sang. 
 It's simple, I have talent, she doesn't. 
 But she got the job because she started doing it with Yuri. 
 He's connected so he got Sonya the job. 
 Moscow Restanrant Brighton Beach Tuesday, September 7 
 Sonya Pietrovicz? 
 Da. 
 You got a minute? 
 Sonya, I'm Detective Benson. 
 This is Detective Stabler. 
 We need to ask you a few questions. 
 About what exactly? 
 How do you know Andrew Harlin? 
 Andrew? I don't know Andrew. 
 Well, let me refresh your memory. 
 Andrew was found strangled to death in a black leather harness, and your fingerprint was found next to the body. 
 I just cleaned his house. 
 He was so friendly, so alive. 
 I mean, his housekeeper, she needed someone to take her job. 
 She needed favor, and he needed... 
 A favor. You do a lot of favors for people. 
 We try to help each other in America. 
 What's the housekeeper's name? 
 Katya, but she's out of the country. 
 Where? 
 On vacation. 
 Where on vacation? 
 I don't know, she took her passport. 
 How long you been working here? 
 I just started. 
 My boyfriend is my manager. 
 You're a singing housekeeper with a connected boyfriend? 
 You do what you have to do. 
 Did you clean Harlin's house Sunday night? 
 I was here at night. 
 I clean up Sunday afternoon. 
 Andrew was not home. 
 That's amazing... big star like you cleaning people's houses. 
 I exaggerate sometimes. 
 Okay... let's start over again. 
 Katya, the housekeeper. 
 Katya. Yeah. 
 She ever sleep with Andrew Harlin? 
 I can't remember. 
 Please turn around. 
 Once, just once. 
 I think... I don't know. 
 Okay, we want to talk to Katya. 
 You have her get in touch with us or find out where she is. 
 By tomorrow. 
 I wonder what else she polished over there. 
 Hey, sleeping with guys is the only way she knows to get on top. 
 So, all Russian girls are whores? listen you guys, remember what they've been through. 
 Poverty, corruption, drunken abuse. 
 They learned that they have to lie. 
 And their bodies are their only asset... s*x is money. 
 So by doin' the right guys, they end up on the Forbeski 400. 
 I know this is a little culturally anthropologic, but Russia's response to the whole Monica Clinton scandal was, "We wish we had such a virile president." 
 Americans think it's just about being a whore. 
 The Russians know there's a little commerce involved in the art of love. 
 That was the Harlins' housekeeper. 
 She's not on vacation, she's not Russian, she never works weekends and her name isn't Katya. 
 A man died, Sonya. 
 And I know nothing about it. 
 But you lied to us about Katya. 
 Sometimes friends are all you have. 
 Why should we believe anything you've got to tell us now? 
 Do, do not... it's your choice. 
 Even if I could tell you, maybe you wouldn't understand. 
 What do you mean? 
 I see the way you look at me. 
 I know you look down upon what I do for a living, but there are certain things about what I do that are not so easy to read. 
 Like what? 
 It is exciting to do something forbidden. 
 My job itself is forbidden in this country... s country that is all about freedoms. 
 But more than that, I am with men who are breaking promises to their wives, and that excites them. 
 It makes them come alive again. 
 I make them come alive again. 
 I am their freedom. 
 And that is delicious. 
 In America, you are what you do. 
 I am thankful not to work in a spa, thankful not to work in a salon, and yet, and of this I am most thankful for of all, my only commitment is to my friends. 
 You mean, to Katya. 
 Why are you so uneasy? 
 It is a small community. 
 People will know I've talked to you and they won't like it. 
 Where does Katya live? 
 She lives with her boyfriends. 
 And you, where do you live? 
 I choose to live with my aunt. 
 It affords me a certain... 
 Freedom? 
 Exactly. 
 Who's Katya dating now? 
 Now? I don't know. 
 I honestly don't know. 
 Elliot, Emily Harlin is here to see you. 
 Daddy told me he loved being in love so much that he fell in love too easily. 
 All that stuff he did... it was his cry for help, but Mom could never reach out to him. 
 Did your mom know about his affairs? 
 Yeah. She didn't seem to mind, as long as it was only with guys, but once he fell in love with Katya, they fought all the time. 
 Katya...? 
 Katya lvanova... she's Russian. 
 My father said she's very beautiful. 
 Did your mom know about Katya? 
 Absolutely... she used to call her his Russian whore. 
 Daddy said that if anything ever happened to him, he kept all of his personal stuff in this secret drawer in his desk, and he told me where he hid the key. 
 So after he died, I waited till I was sure Mom had gone to get her hair done, and I got all of his stuff. 
 There wasn't much there, but I did find one thing. 
 What's that? 
 It's some kind of legal mumbojumbo I can't really understand, but it looks like Daddy was suing Katya for a lot of money. 
 And I was wondering if... 
 You thought maybe that's why he died? 
 Do you know how much your father was suing Katya for? 
 He's suing her for $2 million? 
 See, that's what I call a motive. 
 According to the complaint, that's the value of the gifts she kept. 
 Andrew Harlin and Katya had a fivemonth affair. 
 He broke it off when he found her cheating on him in the apartment he was paying for. 
 I guess Andrew wasn't as understanding as his wife. 
 Here's the hinky part... the morning after Andrew's killed, the lawsuit's dropped... by his wife. 
 After he was dead. 
 Yeah. 
 It sounds like they were working together. 
 I would say that little Katya is now our prime suspect. 
 Do we know where she is? 
 The daughter didn't know, but thought her mother might. 
 She used to hear them arguing all the time about her father paying for Katya's apartment. 
 Give my regards to the widow. 
 Okay. 
 Home Of Andrew & Christina Harlin 60 East 74th Street Wednesday, Semtember 8 
 I always wanted more red in the library but Andrew never liked it. 
 So why didn't you tell us that your husband had a girlfriend that he spent over $2 million on? 
 Oh, Katya. 
 I just assumed that you knew about the lawsuit. 
 Still, $2 million. 
 You decided to drop it. 
 Adam, would you please get our guests some drinks? 
 No, thank you, we're fine. 
 Mrs. Harlan, you told us about the others. 
 You left her out. Why? 
 Are you so sure that Katya didn't do it? 
 I didn't really think about it. 
 We think you did. 
 We think you're covering for her. 
 Me, covering for that little bitch? 
 I was probably trying to cover my humiliation. 
 How would you feel if your husband fell head over heels in love with a Russian whore? 
 Maybe she did you a favor. 
 They are everywhere. 
 They are sucking the men dry. 
 And not only of their money, but of their sanity. 
 They're ruining everybody's marriage. 
 You never heard of the "ultraNatashas"? 
 Well, they all ought to be called Katya. 
 Do you know that "Katya" is Russian slang for $100? 
 What, I'm supposed to become one of those pathetic divorcees who has to say, "And how old is your Russian?" 
 Was there also a Sonya? 
 I didn't know about Sonya, but I bet there was. 
 I bet there was a Sonya and a Natasha and a Nina and an lrina. 
 They're all little whores, little Russian sluts. Sorry, dear. 
 Where were you yesterday afternoon? 
 She drove me to a poetry convention. 
 And I want to say that I told her she should drop the lawsuit. 
 I didn't think she should keep it going. 
 Your husband was paying for everything? 
 She couldn't afford toilet paper. 
 Or an apartment? 
 A $10,000 a month apartment. 
 Two bedrooms, $10,000 a month. 
 Do you have an address? 
 I don't... check with my lawyer. 
 Yeah. Yeah, Okay. Okay, okay. 
 Listen, no, I ca... 
 I can't understand a word you're saying... hold on. 
 John, there's a very upset Russian woman on line two. 
 I can't understand a thing she's saying. 
 You speak a little Russian, right? 
 What, Stolichnaya? 
 Da? 
 Da, da. 
 
 
 
 That was Sonya Pietrovicz, the nightclub singer. 
 She's very scared and upset. 
 She's out in Brighton Beach. 
 Come on, let's take a ride. 
 Apartment Of Sonya Pietrovicz Brighton Beach Wednesday, September 8 
 It's Sonya. 
 Who's the other woman? 
 I don't know, but I better go tell babushka to stop washing the stairs. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It's pretty ugly in there. 
 Nothing like making love with a hatchet. 
 Definitely not sexrelated. 
 Detectives, this is the girl's cousin. 
 He doesn't speak English. 
 Right, right. He has a restaurant right near here. 
 He wants us to go there... and drink or talk. 
 I'm not sure. 
 He says he's very devastated about his cousins. 
 The older woman was Sonya's aunt and his cousin, very fine woman... 
 Ask him if Sonya had any girlfriends that she hung out with. 
 Yeah, she had a few and he has a picture. 
 And like her, they all look like models and talented like her. 
 That's her friend Katya. 
 Not bad. 
 Has he seen this man? 
 They don't bring American boyfriends here. 
 They come when they're homesick. 
 But there's a plus side to all this... he's offering you some borscht. 
 We have one strangled, two axed to death. 
 But why Sonya? 
 Why the aunt? 
 Sonya called here? 
 And sounded nervous? 
 Nervous enough for us to drive out to Brighton Beach. 
 Katya looks more like a martini shaker than an axe swinger. 
 We have her address. 
 We're going there now. 
 Can I help you? 
 Benson and Stabler? 
 Yeah, that's us. 
 Okay, where'd you get that? 
 You've been asking questions. 
 I have information for you. 
 It's a small community. 
 This is one of the most difficult... 
 I'd like to be calm, but... my father... he was not perfect. 
 He drank and he smoked. 
 He slept with other women in front of my mother in the same room. 
 He had his faults, but he was a good man. 
 He was a good man... great heart. 
 And my mother followed my father to Siberia. 
 Her life was his. 
 That's very touching. 
 That's devotion, that's love. 
 Do you understand what real love is? 
 Yes, I think we do. 
 We all know you police are sniffing around. 
 You want to blame Katya, but l... 
 I won't let you. 
 We haven't even found Katya yet. 
 You don't need to. 
 I killed him. 
 Who? 
 Andrew Harlin... 
 I killed him. 
 I couldn't let him treat Katya like that. 
 Who are you again? 
 I am Alexander Strizhov. 
 I bought Katya to America. 
 I arrange everything for her. 
 I... 
 She's like family to me. 
 I love her so much. 
 I'm devoted to her. 
 When that b*st*rd sued her, and I saw her pain... 
 I had to end it. 
 Sir, do you realize what you're saying? 
 We have to advise you of your rights. 
 There's no smoking here. 
 Don't worry, I know what I'm saying. 
 No one would blame me for what I did because it was just. 
 I shot him... 
 I shot him like a dog... and he deserved it! 
 He wasn't shot. 
 Shot, not shot... that's not the point. 
 I did it. I did it, and I killed him like a dog. 
 How'd you kill him? 
 That's not important. 
 What's important is I... 
 I did it! 
 Do you know Sonya Pietrovicz? 
 Sonya, the stewardess? 
 No, Sonya the singer. 
 Oh, that Sonya. 
 Yes, yes, of course I know Sonya. 
 Everyone knows Sonya... great talent, beautiful voice... but I don't really know her. What I am... 
 Did you know Sonya and her aunt were killed in Brighton Beach this morning? 
 No! 
 No! 
 How tragic! 
 Who would hurt Sonya or her aunt? 
 That's what we're figuring out... you don't want to confess to those too, make our lives a little easier? 
 I didn't kill Sonya, but I am telling you I killed Andrew Harlin. 
 Please arrest me... 
 I'm here, ready to pay. 
 Please, please, please... arrest me. 
 Arrest me! Please... 
 Let me guess... he's lying. 
 He did say he shot Harlin. 
 When we know Harlin was strangled. 
 So what makes a man confess to a crime he didn't commit? 
 He talked about love, devotion. 
 To Katya. 
 Who, when they got to this country, definitely did not return his affections. 
 So maybe he's still under her spell. 
 Maybe he thinks this confession is the red cape he's throwing down for her. 
 Does this Prince Charming honestly think we'd believe him? 
 Does he honestly think we're going to turn our attentions away from Katya and onto him? 
 From what you're saying, it sounds like that's exactly what he's hoping. 
 Hope... sometimes that's all love is. 
 Well, he's wrong. 
 Let's go find this Katya. 
 Apartment Of Katya lvanova 14 East 78th Street Wednesday, September 8 
 Katya? 
 She's beautiful. 
 Such a nice, honest girl. 
 Always gives me a big tip, even when I just say hello. 
 You ever see this gentleman enter her apartment? 
 Oh sure, all the time. 
 I haven't seen him in a few weeks, though. 
 It's too bad... he gave very big tips. 
 Yeah? Is she home now? 
 No, she left about an hour ago... very dressed up in a beautiful gown. 
 Did she say where she was going? 
 No, I don't ask questions. 
 Do you have any idea which way the taxi was going? 
 Taxi? Never takes a taxi. 
 She took her car service. 
 It's the easiest number in the book... 5550100. 
 Peninsula Hotel 700 Fifth Avenue Wednesday, September 8 
 There she is... that's her. 
 Katya lvanova? 
 So you knew Andrew Harlin intimately? 
 Are you attracted to me? 
 Miss lvanova... 
 You want to make love to me. 
 Why don't you just start answering my questions, okay? 
 Only if you answer mine first, huh? 
 And what's that gonna cost me? 
 I am too expensive for your detective's salary. 
 And I don't take money. 
 No, you just take husbands. 
 His wife sent you? 
 Who? 
 Who? 
 Who is playing games now? 
 You mean Andrew's wife, Christina? 
 I thought she wanted to open the case again. 
 You know, your friend Sonya's dead? 
 I know. 
 I'm very sad. 
 She was a very good friend, but I have to go on with my life. 
 I don't know who would want to kill her. 
 She was very innocent. 
 Innocent of what? 
 Why don't we continue this conversation down at the unit? 
 Yeah. 
 Now? 
 Now would be good. 
 Am I under arrest? 
 Not yet. 
 Then I think I say no. 
 I'm all dressed up. 
 You come down to the station tomorrow morning. 
 We've got some questions that we need answered. 
 And it's gonna take a while, so why don't you wear something a little more comfortable? 
 I am too busy. 
 Look, we know you're illegal. 
 We're not Vice. 
 We don't care how much undeclared income you have or how many gifts you've received, but if you're not at our office by 9:00 a.m., lmmigration will be at your house by 9:05. 
 That I can personally guarantee you. 
 This is America... you can't do this. 
 Sweetheart, let me let you in on a little secret... cops are the same everywhere. 
 Okay, but could we make it noon? 
 I'm not what you call a morning person. 
 I don't even know if I'll be home by 9:00. 
 You people are already working, hmm? 
 So you are used to this kind of hour. 
 There's no smoking in the building. 
 I'll come back later... 
 I can't talk without a cigarette. 
 All right? 
 Are you married? 
 Do you know Alexander "Strizhov"? 
 Strizhov. 
 Whatever. 
 Yes, very good man... has a good heart, very generous. 
 Yeah, so it seems. 
 He confessed to Andrew Harlin's murder. 
 It was him. 
 Poor Alex, such a bad temper. 
 The problem is, poor Alex didn't kill Andrew Harlin. 
 Then why did he confess? 
 That's something we were hoping you could tell us. 
 Yours and Sonya's fingerprints were found near the body. 
 I wore gloves. 
 So now you're confessing? 
 No. 
 I didn't want to break my nails on those metal rings on that stupid harness. 
 Sonya and I went to Andrew's to tease him. 
 No one gets away with treating me like he did. 
 Right, so you killed him. 
 No, I didn't kill him. 
 I let him tie me up so many times just to please him, and he sues me. 
 He appreciated nothing that I did for him. 
 So why did he sue you? 
 Wasn't it because he found you cheating on him? 
 What? I found him in bed with two men... that was it. 
 So tell me something... why'd you bring Sonya with you? 
 Because sometimes we did three some. 
 You should try it. 
 With Sonya, it was fun. 
 I don't mind... 
 I could trust her, we were friends. 
 I'm not lesbian. 
 Neither was Sonya. 
 Sonya admired me... she was very feminine. 
 But two men... nyet. 
 So you weren't too upset when you found out he was dead. 
 It's very strange about death. 
 But you have to understand... 
 I have to live my life... be secure, stable, so I have to sleep with men like him... it's an investment. 
 Then I can fall in love without a business interest. 
 Can you please tell me where you went after you were teasing Andrew? 
 I went to hear Sonya sing, and meet a friend. 
 One thing... did you put the banana in Andrew's rear end? 
 Yes. 
 He is allergic to bananas. 
 But if that killed him, it was an honest mistake. 
 Cabarets, spas, salons, rich boyfriends, hookers... what the hell are we talking about here? 
 Maybe the Russian Mafia killed Harlin. 
 And Sonya. 
 Or had them killed. We haven't looked into the Russian Mafia... maybe it's time we did. 
 But here's the part I don't understand. 
 What? 
 Everyone we have talked to has described Katya as some modernday Cleopatra. 
 Instead we get a Siberian Tammy Faye Baker. 
 Andrew Harlin was loaded... he could have had anyone he wanted... why Katya? 
 Because it was dangerous. 
 Harlin likes extremes... girlfriends, boyfriends, bananas. 
 I'm sure sleeping with the girlfriend of a Russian mobster had a certain je ne sais quoi. 
 "Je ne sais quoi"? 
 Yeah. N'estce pas? 
 One language at a time, merci? 
 Would you two go back to that cabaret joint, the one Sonya's boyfriend owns, and see what he's fronting? 
 Moscow Restaurant Brighton Beach Thursday, September 9 
 Do you know Sonya Pietrovicz? 
 Poor, poor Sonya. 
 What do you want to drink? 
 Her boyfriend here? 
 Excuse me, would you like to join our table? 
 Of course. 
 I would like to ask your lady to dance. 
 Thank you, but I don't dance. 
 Then you'll have to wait here. 
 Sweet Sonya... such youth, such ambition. 
 What a waste of great talent. 
 How'd you know I wanted to talk about Sonya? 
 My wife liked Sonya very much. 
 She always liked to listen to her sing. 
 My wife used to sing, so Sonya remind her of herself. 
 But now she very, very upset that Sonya's dead. 
 Unnecessary dead. 
 Where's this going? 
 Life is a matter of making choices... good choices and bad choices. 
 They teach this in America, too, and we Russians are trying to learn this from you. 
 That's very flattering. 
 She was always with wrong men. 
 Such as? 
 Alexander Strizhov. 
 We gave him chance. 
 We had high hopes for him, but now... 
 You've had enough. 
 What do you think? 
 What kind of choice is Alex? 
 Alex? 
 You're 100%/2 right. He was bad choice... unnecessary bad choice. 
 So Alex is the bad guy. 
 We are not bad men. 
 We are combination of good and evil. 
 I said he was wrong. 
 You got any proof? 
 What do you need? 
 To prove that he killed her, or killed Andrew Harlin. 
 I not suggest anything. 
 We are having friendly conversation. 
 I work for airline business, and you are police, and we are new in this country with new ways. 
 That's all I know. 
 Boardwalk Birghton Beach Thursday, September 9 
 Give me a call, okay? 
 Thanks for your help. 
 Thanks. Very nice. 
 Hello, my friends! 
 Hey, you're still looking! 
 So now you speak English? 
 Nyet. 
 You're starting to piss me off. 
 Because I'm drunk? 
 No, because you just spoke English. 
 When I drink, I speak every language, moron. 
 Why don't you tell us what you know? 
 I know a lot. 
 I hear yelling. 
 Then I think Sonya and Alex have s*x again, like always... he's spanking, I like. 
 But then I hear screaming. 
 Poor Sonya. 
 Alexander, as in Alex Strizhov? 
 Don't interrupt. Yes, yes. 
 So I hear yelling, I hear, "You killed!" 
 And then crash, bang, he kill her. 
 Who? Alex? 
 Don't interrupt! Yes, Alex... you're a smart man, you are wi... he's a brilliant man. 
 Excuse me, are you mocking him? 
 You're losers. 
 You're more stupid than my ass. 
 Yeah, Alex... of course, Alex! 
 Poor Alexander Strizhov. 
 Poor Sonya! 
 They all suffer like me, soaked in blood. 
 We know he killed Sonya. 
 We think he killed Andrew as well. 
 How do you know? 
 We know. 
 We just don't know why. 
 I don't either. 
 Did you know Alex and Sonya were sleeping together? 
 So? 
 Maybe she wasn't as good as me in bed. 
 That's no reason to kill her. 
 Weren't you and Sonya good friends? 
 Yes, but she's allowed to sleep with whoever she wants to. 
 Were you sleeping with Alex? 
 Not anymore. 
 So what if we were? 
 Can I talk to her alone for a minute? 
 You know how easy it would be to convict you? 
 No. 
 You were at Andrew's, you tied him up, you and your friend Sonya left fingerprints, you were being sued. 
 Come on, Katya, I know you're not an idiot. 
 A jury would find you guilty in a heartbeat. 
 I am not guilty. 
 So help us catch Alex. 
 I am busy. 
 So what, you don't care if a murderer gets caught? 
 You don't feel any fear or any guilt? 
 Who are you? some s*x machine with a cash register between her legs? 
 Or maybe you're just too afraid to get involved. 
 You got it. 
 I have got a war out there with everyone to make sure that I survive, understand? 
 Some lose, some die, and some win. 
 No one helps anyone. 
 Alex is upset because I don't want to have s*x with him anymore. 
 I have more things to worry about. 
 Like your nails? 
 You make your living sleeping with guys. 
 You should sleep with men more... trust me, it would help you. 
 You wouldn't be such a mean bitch. 
 I make my living catching murderers. 
 America's not so different from Russia, you know. 
 Especially the prisons. 
 There's no champagne, there's no caviar. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Well, fine, we'll do it your way. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 You are under arrest... 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 I'll do it, just once. 
 I guess I'm in the mood for horseradish vodka. 
 What? 
 At the restaurant Alex hangs out at, my favorite vodka is horseradish. 
 Moscow Restaurant Brighton Beach Thursday, September 9 
 What? 
 Something, something, you betrayed me. 
 Something about Pushkin. 
 John, for cryin' out loud, do we move out or not? 
 She says she's not in jail because she's too busy. 
 Okay, like we're not. 
 I can't believe these people. 
 She's saying Alex killed Andrew, so he must really love her. 
 That's great. 
 Wait... he's saying he should just get it over with... now! 
 Munch, call for backup! 
 Put the gun down! 
 Put the gun down! 
 Put the gun down, now! 
 Drop it! 
 Don't worry, I won't shoot anyone. 
 I will tell you a Russian love poem. 
 It could be long, it could be short. 
 Depends... unless you want to shoot me now and not hear anything. 
 I brought Katya to America. 
 I loved her. 
 I did everything to protect her. 
 I wanted to marry her and she left me. 
 I gave her devotion. 
 She had no gratitude. 
 My mother was always grateful to my father. 
 I went into Andrew's house after the girls left him tied up. 
 I strangled him with a rope around his neck. 
 I wanted Katya to pay, to learn she can't stop respecting me. 
 I had to teach her a bloody lesson. 
 I told Sonya... sometimes you make stupid mistakes. 
 I didn't want to kill her, but I had to. 
 I know she called you. 
 I could kill her because I didn't love her. 
 And the aunt... 
 I told her to go to the store... to buy something, but the store was closed, and so she came back too soon. 
 What else could I do? 
 Alex, put the gun down. 
 I wanted to be happy. 
 I wanted to live with Katya in America. 
 I wanted her to love me, but she hurt me. 
 No one hurts me, not even this gun. 
 See how lucky I am? 
 Let's go home, Olivia. 
 Some people consider death a blessing. 
 This was no blessing. 
 What a mess. 
 Blowing people's heads off because of some vodka induced, thirdrate notion of tragedy. 
 That's a lot of crap. 
 And for this they come to America.
