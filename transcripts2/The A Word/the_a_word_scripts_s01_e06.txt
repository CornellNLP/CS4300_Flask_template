 ♪ World, shut your mouth Shut your mouth... ♪ 
 It's your family. You're all so intense. I can't see you again. 
 Luke finished with me. 
 I've got a reading week so I thought I'd go and stay with my dad for a bit. 
 How is he autistic? I don't understand. 
 Right, no-one uses that word. If we label him now, it's over. 
 What do you think about that, then, eh, Joe? 
 Standing on top of the world. 
 The first ten years, everything was Ralph. 
 Joe isn't Ralph. 
 The morning-after pill? Why did you do it behind my back? 
 I don't want another child. 
 Except I do. 
 We have Joe. 
 He makes everything different. 
 Then there will never be a right time, will there? 
 No. 
 [WIND HOWLS] 
 Hey, Joe. 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Someone's keen. 
 Says the man who slept here all night. 
 Are we ready? 
 We will be. 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 OK, you're not picking up, I get it, but we'll be there as soon as we can with the flowers so... you can't avoid me forever. 
 [HORN BEEPS] 
 You'll be knackered. I love you. 
 Right, shall we get you ready? Come on, then. 
 Happy? 
 Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we? 
 I'm not sure we agreed on the Santa's Grotto, did we? 
 Or is that another line in the budget that you added while I wasn't looking? 
 Yes, Gary, I know. 
 Got 100 things to do, but let me just have this moment, eh? 
 101, mate. Pot washer called in sick. 
 [HE SIGHS] 
 [MOTOR WHIRS] 
 Terry? 
 I want her looking her best for her special day. 
 You're not opening up today. You're needed up the hill. 
 But Alison said we were. Did she not tell you? 
 No. 
 Not exactly on speaking terms at the minute. 
 Oh, right. 
 Hopefully that's nothing you want to talk about, is it? 
 I hope you're getting a move on, Joe. 
 Hey, what are you doing in Becky's room? 
 Hey. The sooner we get you ready, the sooner you will see Becky and your dad. Come on. Go, go, go. 
 Look at this. Look at this, hey? You little lovely. 
 You are so lucky, aren't you? Isn't this a cool-looking...? 
 Becky, just leave her alone, will you? 
 If you ignore her for long enough, she'll go back to sleep. 
 Hi. Hi. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Bye, lovely sister. I'll see you next Saturday, won't I? 
 Yeah? Yes, I will. Won't I? Eh? 
 Er... 
 Rebecca, love... next Saturday is probably not going to be great for us. 
 [SHE MOUTHS] 
 When you've got a new baby in the house... it's just, well, if people turn up without warning, it just can be a bit... 
 You know? 
 People. Yeah, I get it. I'm people. 
 Come on, Becks, don't be like that. 
 You know how I'm fixed. 
 I've got four kids and a missus who's mainlining hormones. 
 You've got five kids, Dad. Five. 
 I didn't mean it like that. OK? Look, I'm not saying don't come. 
 I'm not. I'm not. I'm just saying... 
 I bet they need you at home, though, eh? With that brother of yours. 
 No, not really. He's just a kid. Normal kid. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Thanks for dropping her off, Stewart. 
 No worries, Paul. 
 Hey, good luck with the... 
 Yeah, it's looking good, eh? 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 You're more than welcome to come in for a drink and a bite to eat. 
 All three, for gratis, for nothing. 
 Not really, bit of a rush. 
 Right, good. 
 Can you do me a favour today, love? 
 Can you keep an eye on Joe? 
 And if he's, you know, being a bit... like, you know, just calm him down a little bit or maybe bring him out here for a bit of a play. 
 Yeah, if he's embarrassing us I'll lock him in a cupboard somewhere. 
 No, come on - I didn't mean that, and you know it. 
 Why is it that parents always worry about their kids showing them up when actually they are the embarrassing ones? 
 So, what do you need me for? Sous chef? 
 Sort of. 
 Um, couple of things, mate. 
 Never walk backwards in a kitchen, and if you're carrying something behind people, you always yell "backs". 
 Backs. 
 Backs. 
 I'm liking it, Terry - quick on the uptake. 
 You'll be a chief potwasher in no time. 
 I'm actually a fully qualified barista, mate. 
 Online course, but even so. 
 Paul. 
 Yeah. 
 You're going to have to ring the suppliers about these leaves. 
 What's wrong with them? 
 I've seen more life in a pharaoh's dick. 
 Remind me why they turned you down for Saturday Kitchen again, Gary. 
 So, what do you want to talk about first? 
 You sleep in here last night? 
 Were you ignoring my calls this morning? 
 How about ice and lemon? Hmm? 
 It's the little things you forget, isn't it? 
 Well, Gary doesn't mind, do you, Gary? 
 Mm. 
 I'm sure he's heard worse. 
 Have you any idea what temperature Eddie's keeping this Indian pale ale? 
 One degree either way and it tastes like Tonto's headband. 
 Why don't you ask Eddie, Maurice? 
 I would - but he's only just coming down from his call. 
 Must be an important one, eh, Nicola, to get our Eddie going up a fell in two feet of snow? 
 Well, unless he comes with the Ten Commandments, then he's due a bollocking. 
 Joe's going to be here the whole time, is he? 
 Do you think that's wise? 
 See, it's you I'm worried about, Maurice. 
 Oh! 
 Are you going to leave it like this?! 
 Not liking the Hacienda vibe, Dad? 
 Don't worry, we've got a velvet rope. 
 Rebecca, I want one of each colour in each vase, and then a vase on each table. 
 All right? Joe can give you a hand. 
 This floor intentional? 
 It's like the unfinished look. 
 It's not a criticism. 
 It never is. 
 At last. 
 I just thought it was a feature, you know? 
 Modern. 
 I wonder why you say "modern" like other people say "sewage". 
 This floor's going to come up brilliant, mate - thematically consistent. 
 Yeah - if the theme is "we need to open before we run out of money". 
 Joe could get up here no problem. I'm just saying. 
 Well, he's not up there, is he, Maurice? You are. 
 And if you come through that floor, I'll bury you where you stand, dead or alive. 
 [GLASS SMASHES] 
 Oh... 
 OK, OK, don't panic. 
 Oh, you're all right. 
 Don't panic - Rebecca, dustpan and brush. 
 Ohh - all right? 
 You all right? 
 Joe? Right, come here. 
 You stand here like a soldier, and when somebody gives you a glass, bring it to the bar. OK? 
 Dad, he doesn't need supervising, he was just excited to see Rebecca again - he'll be fine. 
 [TRAY CLATTERS] 
 It's all right - it's all right, it's all right. 
 Oh, I brought that dress I got you - that you never wear. 
 Hey, why don't you see what your grandad's doing, eh? 
 Don't look like that - it looks lovely on you. 
 You can change in the loo. Go on. 
 That's it. 
 Phew! 
 Bloody hell, it's freezing in here. 
 Yeah - I'll put the heating on when the punters arrive, all right? 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Right... 
 Finger-food preview. 
 Mm! 
 Cod brandade with squid in crackers, and a pine nut and cucumber granitas. 
 Mm! 
 Have you got anything that's actually looked over a fence? 
 [HE SIGHS] 
 Are you getting them, Dad? The lemony notes? 
 What's it matter to you? You're leaving, anyway. 
 He's changed his mind. 
 Has he? Good. 
 Cos this tastes better than Blondie's bathwater. 
 Eww! 
 Parallel Lines tour, Lancaster Town Hall. 
 Don't ask. 
 Ngh! 
 What? 
 The phone call... 
 Mm-hm, what? 
 They've offered me the job in Manchester... and... I've accepted. 
 What, sorry? Eddie, you've what? 
 It's exciting. 
 For both of us. 
 It's the right thing. I know it, and, deep down, I think you do, too. 
 'Scuse me. 
 Backs. 
 Child. 
 [STOVE SIZZLES] 
 Joe, come on! 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 What are you doing in here? 
 If you see an empty glass, just fill it, yeah? 
 Oh, see! Perfect! You look lovely. 
 Aren't I right, Tom? 
 Don't say a word. 
 Right, you can either have a great launch or you can have Joe here, but you can't have both. 
 I've got to nip out for an hour - why don't I take him with me, let you get up and running? 
 He's part of the family, Dad - he should be here. 
 Maurice, yes, that would be great. I don't think he should be here. 
 Come on. 
 Mm... 
 Oh, there we go - hold that look. 
 You won the argument. 
 Ooh... It's Ralph, innit? 
 I'm Maurice. This is Joe. 
 Does Mum know that you were coming? 
 No. Um... 
 Mum! 
 There's this man back again. 
 Louise, er, this is Joe. Joe, this is Louise. 
 Hello, Joe. Pleased to meet you. 
 The gastro-pub's opening today. Soft opening, they call it - when it's not finished, like. 
 I know. 
 So, I was just wondering... if you fancied it - and Ralph, of course - there's plenty to drink, and finger food... squid... crackers and, er... pine nuts that have been interfered with... 
 I don't think so. 
 There you go, Joe. 
 Hey, er, lads - you'll be all right together, won't you, for five minutes? 
 Two lads together, while me and Louise go and have a chat. 
 They'll be all right, won't they? 
 Doesn't sound like me that needs convincing. 
 He wants to talk to you, Mum. 
 [MUSIC PLAYS THROUGH HEADPHONES] 
 [CHATTER AND MUSIC] 
 Hi! 
 Nice dress. 
 Yeah - you're here with your mum, so let's leave the dress out of it. 
 Who invited Luke? 
 Eh? Oh... 
 His mum must be on the mailing list. 
 Nightmare. 
 OK. 
 Luke! 
 Sorry, son - you're underage, and I've got my license to think of. 
 How about some squash? 
 Wait, Luke, stop. 
 I only came to see you - 
 I didn't want to come to some poncey restaurant in the first place. 
 It's a gastro-pub, not a restaurant. 
 [HE SIGHS] 
 No, wait, why did you want to see me? 
 I wrote this for you. 
 Probably won't be seeing me very much any more. 
 You were right. 
 About what? 
 About Joe... and your lad. 
 You were right. 
 Oh, well, yes, I know that already. 
 But I'm saying it now - and having two lads that are a bit different... 
 ...well, grandson in my case... 
 Well, we've got that in common, for starters. 
 Maurice, you're a lovely man... 
 I wouldn't go that far! 
 No. 
 Now, I know I can go in a bit two-footed from time to time, and I'm not saying we're going to be cavorting beside of Derwentwater, you know? 
 Not without a flask and knee bandages, at any rate! 
 But, you know, I wouldn't mind knocking about with you. 
 Maurice, when was the last time you asked a woman out? 
 I didn't ask Sandra out - we just found ourselves snogging at a club when the lights went up. 
 Mm - can't beat a bit of musical tongues. 
 [HE CHUCKLES] 
 It's like an arranged marriage with a glitter ball! 
 Is that offensive to Muslims? 
 I'm not sure what you can say or not... 
 The thing is, Maurice, I can't be doing with strong emotion. 
 Right. 
 I've got enough of me own - and you strike me as a man that feels everything strongly, even if you're not sure what it is you're feeling. 
 So, are you saying yes or no? 
 Are we...? 
 Maurice... 
 Are we on or not? 
 Maurice, I've just said no in as many ways as I can think of, and... 
 Ralph : Mum, Mum! 
 He went outside in the garden, and then Joe wasn't... 
 When was this, Ralph? When did it happen? 
 When did he go outside? Joe?! 
 I don't know... I made him another drink... 
 Joe! 
 Joe? 
 Joe! 
 Joe?! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Joe! 
 Excuse me, have you seen a little lad? 
 Have you seen him? 
 No. 
 Where did he go? Which way did he go? 
 He went outside. 
 I know he went outside - where did he go when he went outside? 
 Maurice! Stop shouting at the lad, you're scaring him. 
 I'll scare him if he's done anything to Joe! 
 Don't you dare talk to my son like that! Get out! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, son. 
 Can you just remember what happened? 
 He went into the garden. 
 Right - and where were you? 
 In here, making a drink. 
 And when you went outside, he was gone? You didn't see anything, you didn't hear anything? 
 Just calm down. Think about it. 
 Joe goes wandering off - you've said so yourself. 
 Now, will he have gone back home? 
 Well, not from here, I wouldn't have thought so. 
 So, will he have gone back to the gastro-pub? 
 You're right, he was enjoying himself. 
 I'll drive to the gastro-pub - I bet that's where he is. 
 Why don't you just phone Alison and ask her? 
 Because he'll be there, won't he? And if he's not there, he'll be on the road, and she'll worry, and they've got enough to worry about. 
 I'll find him, and... no harm done. 
 It's good, isn't it? 
 It's very good, yeah... and it was very good when Simon Armitage wrote it. 
 What? No, Luke wrote it. 
 Luke wrote it OUT, Rebecca. 
 That isn't the same as writing it. 
 No way, look... 
 "But said some things and never meant them, sweet nothings anybody could have mentioned, And left..." 
 "And left unsaid some things he should have spoken about the heart, where it hurts exactly, and how often." 
 Someone gave that poem to me, too, once. 
 Oh, right. 
 Eddie? 
 No. Not Eddie. 
 Come to think of it, I'm not even sure this is his handwriting. 
 Come on, Joe. 
 Come on, son, next corner. Come on, Joe. 
 Come on, son, next corner. 
 Oh, and just so you know, I know you didn't write that poem. 
 It's fake - like you. 
 Like when I pretended to come, like as fake as that. 
 Enjoy the rest of your life. 
 Rebecca, not here, not now. Please, no phones. 
 All right, I won't be needing it ever again, anyway. 
 Rebecca! 
 You are allowed to enjoy this, you know? 
 I'll enjoy it when we start making money. 
 OK, outside. 
 One minute only. 
 I don't have a minute. 
 Honestly, I don't have the time. 
 I can say it in here, or I can say it outside, but I'm going to say it either way. 
 OK? Get your coat. 
 There. 
 Now... 
 You and me are in the middle of 30 shades of crap right now... 
 Yeah, I won't argue with that. 
 ...and I lied to you about the morning-after pill, and you lied to me about how having Joe really made you feel - and I hurt you... 
 ...and you hurt me. I know that much. 
 As far as pep talks go, love, this is right up there. 
 Oh, shut up! 
 Before I kiss you again. 
 I love you, Paul Hughes, and you love me. 
 Maybe if I hadn't talked you out of getting that tattoo you wanted done in Blackpool that time, I wouldn't have had to say this out loud - 
 I could've just pointed at that mermaid with our names written on her breasts and you would have known what I meant. 
 OK. 
 We can sort this out. 
 All right? 
 You and me. 
 Do you believe me? 
 Yeah. I do. 
 Yeah, I do believe you - but that doesn't mean that this is sorted out, OK? 
 I know, I know - but for now, for today... buck your ideas up and get back in there with a smile, cos we're going to make this work - all of it. 
 The restaurant, me, you... 
 Joe, Rebecca, all of it. 
 Because we always have, and we always will. 
 All right? 
 Thanks, love. 
 Now, get back in there and make the speech of your life. 
 Oh, no! No speeches. 
 Music :  Too Much Too Young  by The Specials There you go. 
 I don't think there's an appropriate moment to discuss this. 
 Maybe not, but there's an inappropriate moment, and it's now. 
 I'm late. 
 Why do you want to stay? 
 You don't even have a proper job, and all I get is heartache and earache. 
 I'm late. 
 For what? Thought I was the one that was supposed to be late. 
 Ugh, wish I hadn't started this now. 
 My period is late. 
 Your period's never late. 
 I know. 
 That's one of the reasons I fell in love with you. 
 I think I might be pregnant. 
 That's why I don't want to move. 
 [GLASS CLINKS] 
 Ladies and gentlemen, can we have a bit of quiet, please, while mine host says a few words? 
 Speech! 
 Er... 
 Go on, mate. 
 No pressure! 
 I told my wife Alison that I wouldn't be making any speeches, and for those of you that know her, you won't be surprised to see me standing here right now doing just that. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Er... 
 So, yeah, I started with a book, how to start and run your own gastro-pub, and here we are, nine months later - we've got a kitchen, 20 tables and a launch. 
 Still haven't read that bloody book. 
 It shows. 
 I know. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Thank you, my love. Er... 
 Thank you for coming. 
 If I'd known the weather was going to turn out like this... 
 Hey, you haven't seen Joe? 
 No, I thought he was with you. 
 Now, listen, if you've had a nice time, and you've enjoyed the food, then please tell all your mates... and if you haven't had a nice time, and you think the food is shite, then, you know, keep quiet - it's free. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 The Fellside. Thank you. 
 All : The Fellside! 
 My lad's out there, and there's snow on the high ground and the forecast is sh1t, and there's people who want to get out there and get looking, what... why are we wasting time doing this? 
 Trust me, the last thing we need is a posse of well-meaning mint-cakers arse-deep in snow. 
 That's why my lads are just trying to get some ground rules in place. 
 First thing you need to know is that most five-year-olds are found close by where they went missing. 
 We've got four officers on foot and we've got four patrol cars looking in parks and streets within half a mile... 
 Right, I've heard enough, I'm going. 
 Hang on, Alison. 
 Please, love. 
 Look, let's just wait till we hear from your home, OK? 
 If he's not there, we can scale up - and sharpish, believe me. 
 He'll have gone home, won't he? 
 Course he will. I bet you, eh? 
 There, that's the most recent one. I took that last week. 
 Right. Thanks. 
 Can we get that printed off? 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 
 
 
 Joe? Joe? Joe?! 
 Joe? Joe? 
 We know what he was wearing - headphones, likely, as well. 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Hello. 
 Yeah, well, look - just use a couple of hobby bobbies to search near the garages and that near the house, yeah? 
 We have to tell him, you do know that, don't you? 
 Did you hear what he just said? He's most likely at home. 
 No, he didn't, Alison. He didn't say that. 
 Just... Look, what if we tell everyone about Joe's problems now and then it turns out he was at home all along? 
 Look... Just think about it - think about it for one minute. 
 How would that be for him? 
 He'd be the autistic kid that went missing for the rest of his life. 
 Mum's right. Don't want him to be the village freak. 
 Maurice, surely you agree with me. 
 I don't know. 
 What do you mean, you don't know? 
 You always know! 
 Yeah, just like you knew he'd be safe with you. 
 So, er... 
 You say he does do a bit of wandering off on his own? 
 No, no, he doesn't go wandering off - he goes for a walk every morning, just near the house. 
 On his own? At five years old? 
 We knew where he was. 
 And where was that? 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Sorry, guys. 
 Right. 
 Right, OK. Thanks. 
 Joe's not at the house. 
 They've searched the gardens and the outbuildings and nearby farm buildings. 
 We'll scale our operation up, but I need you to talk to the volunteers and give them all the details you can. 
 You know, medical conditions. 
 You and Maurice both said he had a bit of a problem. 
 With his hearing. 
 Well, he's, um... 
 He's a bit different to, er... other five-year-olds. 
 And... 
 He doesn't always do what you think a kid his age might do. 
 Will you, er... tell them a bit more about that, Alison? 
 Well, um... 
 He might not want to talk to you, if you do find him. 
 And, er... he might... 
 No, he will - he will be wearing headphones, so shouting his name isn't... 
 I mean, it will be worth a try, but even if he isn't wearing headphones, he tends to be a bit... 
 ...just, dreamy. So... 
 ...he could've gone off anywhere. 
 And, um... 
 Yeah, and he's not great with people talking directly to him, so... 
 He's, you know, he's not just going to come running if he sees you. 
 He loves pop music. 
 Yeah. 
 A lot. 
 Yeah. 
 So, any music that you've got on your phones or your car stereos, or your iPods, anything like that, just... 
 Cos he feels safe with music. 
 What Alison and Paul are trying to tell you is that, er... he's on the, um... 
 ...that... he's got autism. 
 Is that right? He's autistic. 
 Yes, Joe's on the autism spectrum. 
 And what does that mean, exactly, Alison? 
 You know, in terms of helping to find him. 
 It means a lot of things. It means... 
 The main thing is that he might not know that he's lost... or in danger. 
 That's the difference, that's the real difference. 
 Right, groups of two or more people. 
 We do not want to waste time looking for you, as well. 
 How long were you in the living room with Louise? 
 I'd say 15 minutes. 
 Maurice, Joe's missing... so, if you were upstairs shagging, and you're too embarrassed to say, you'd better get over that. 
 For God's sake, we were in the living room. Why would I lie? 
 Did, um... 
 Did Ralph seem overfamiliar with Joe at all when you saw them together? 
 What's this all about? All that stuff on the bus from years ago? 
 We both know that's bollocks - you said it was. 
 Yeah, it was, but... there's a child missing now, so nothing's off the table. 
 Ralph did nothing wrong then, and he's done nothing wrong now. 
 Joe ran off. He wouldn't hurt a fly! 
 You KNOW that, do you? 
 It's just a feeling I get about people, and I trust my feelings. 
 Trust your feelings enough to bet Joe's life on 'em? 
 Maurice? 
 Maurice, you can't go shooting off up the hills on your own, like some tourist. 
 I know these hills like the back of my hand. 
 You lot can all go whistling into the wind. 
 I lost him, I'll find him. 
 Look, Alison doesn't really think that, Maurice! 
 Oh, doesn't she? Well, I do. 
 No, love, listen, it's best that you stay here for when he comes home. 
 Just call me if you hear anything, anything at all. 
 Yeah, of course, I will, course. 
 Right, then, love, are you ready? 
 I've said he's got autism because people don't understand if you just say he's on the spectrum. 
 Good, yeah, that's great. 
 Right, come on, then. 
 Hang on, hang on. 
 It's just boys being stupid. 
 I just hope Joe understands why we did this when he's 16. 
 Once on the internet, always on the internet. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 Exactly, just like what Luke and his mate are writing about you. 
 That's not what I was talking about, Dad. 
 I'm going to kick his arse from here to Barrow-in-Furness. 
 Well, that's not going to help find Joe, is it? 
 Now, you listen to me, you're worth 100 of him. 
 Don't you ever forget that. 
 He's a piece of sh1t that you need to scrape off your shoe. 
 Come on. 
 You've got nothing to be scared of. 
 The police just want to ask you some questions, so you can help them find Joe. 
 I don't want to talk to the police. 
 It won't be like last time. 
 It won't. I'll knock them through. 
 Ralph, you can't go hitting policemen, love. 
 How long have we known each other, pal? 
 I told him to stay in his garden. 
 But you were here in the kitchen when he left. 
 I'm telling the truth. 
 I know, love, and so does Bob. 
 Don't you, Bob?

 Half the town's out looking for him and there's something I want to tell you. 
 What do you...? 
 What do you think of Ralph? 
 Ralph, he's the lollipop man, I see him every day. Why? 
 Why are you asking me about Ralph? 
 I don't know, he was the last person to see Joe. 
 And he's Down's, so that means he's suspicious, does it? 
 No, not at all, it's just something Bob Herd mentioned, well, reminded me of, really. 
 Something or nothing, but if I didn't tell you and you heard the rumours from somebody else... 
 What? What? 
 What rumours? What's Ralph supposed to have done? 
 Years back, a couple of bullies said he touched a girl's leg on the bus. 
 He was interviewed by the police. 
 There was nothing come of it, you know. 
 The lads admitted they were lying, you know, to wind Ralph up. 
 They're a pair of scumbags. 
 So, you've just told me that Ralph was accused of something that he hadn't done a long time ago. 
 I don't... 
 What am I supposed to do with that? 
 Why would...? 
 Why are you telling me this?! 
 Because if, God forbid, something has happened to Joe... 
 Because God forbid that you might just feel a bit guilty that Joe went missing on your watch! 
 There's no "might just" about it. 
 Ralph can't speak up for himself, you might want to just think about that. 
 Oh, God. Can you just stay here? 
 Because someone has to be here in case Joe comes home. 
 Where are you going? 
 It's just a precaution at this stage. 
 Oh, it's stupid. I just thought I'd... 
 I thought if I saw the police, I would know where he went, like, by magic or something. 
 I get that. 
 Ralph, hiya. 
 Look, you know you're not in trouble, don't you? 
 Not with me and not with Joe's dad. 
 But if you remember anything, just anything, anything Joe said, anything that you said... 
 Ralph? 
 Hey, come and sit down. 
 I don't like Inspector Herd very much. Do you? 
 No. 
 I don't like him. 
 Yeah. 
 Was there anything that happened, Ralph? Was... 
 Like, not on purpose. 
 But... 
 Were you playing a game? 
 Maybe just get a bit mixed up? 
 Alison... 
 Ralph hasn't done anything to Joe. 
 He didn't do anything to Joe. 
 He's honest. 
 Too honest, if anything. 
 Now, I know you want to talk to him, and I get that, really, but that's enough. 
 As one mum to another, I am telling you he's had enough. 
 Got to ask you this... 
 Somebody said there was, like... 
 ...like, a misunderstanding a few years back. 
 He was on a bus or something...? 
 God, that b*st*rd Bob Herd told you that, did he? 
 A misunderstanding? 
 That boy was bullied, he was lied about, he was the victim. 
 Did Bob Herd tell you that? 
 I'm sorry, I've just got to find Joe. I feel like I'm the only person that can find him. 
 [SHE INHALES SHARPLY] 
 I know that, and I know you're in hell right now... but Ralph doesn't know anything.

 Alison : Paul? 
 Paul? 
 Come here. 
 I just thought, you know, places that we'd been. 
 Yeah, I know, me too. 
 I was looking at his things. I was looking at his pictures, and his writing, and his terrible, terrible colouring-in and I just... 
 If we find him... 
 When we find him, Alison. 
 WHEN we find him. "When", not "if". 
 If I find him, I don't want to change anything about him any more. 
 I just want him back. I want Joe. 
 Joe, as he is. 
 We'll find him. 
 You remember the last thing that you said to him? 
 Don't do this. 
 Don't do this now. 
 Can't remember the last thing I said to him, and I think that I was short with him, and I just want him back. 
 I want our lovely little boy. 
 Come here. 
 We'll find him. I promise you, we'll find him. 
 OK? I promise. 
 [SHE SOBS] 
 [MOBILE RINGS] 
 Wait a minute. 
 Hello? 
 [CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO] 
 Bob? 
 This must have been where he was coming every day. 
 Look at that stuff he found. 
 Our lads missed it on the first sweep. 
 Your sister-in-law found it. 
 This is new. 
 He only had this this morning. He's been here. 
 Are you sure, Alison? 
 Yeah. 
 There's loads of those toys around. 
 No, no, because he wouldn't normally go for something like this. 
 It's only because Rebecca gave it to him this morning... and she'd been away... and he missed her. 
 Right, OK. 
 So what now, Bob? 
 We focus on this area. 
 We focus all our resources down here. 
 What f*cking resources, though, Bob? I've seen about three coppers. 
 Come here. Come on, come on. 
 Shh. 
 No, but when you see this on the news there's hundreds - where is everybody? 
 Look... with it being this close to the water, and with him being missing for this amount of time, we're getting the underwater team in.

 What are you doing? 
 What everybody's doing - trying to help find your brother. 
 We saw on your Facebook that he was missing. 
 Oh, yeah, you've been really busy online, haven't you? 
 My dad was well impressed. 
 Is there a reward? 
 Yeah, a brain. 
 I'd go for it, if I were you. 
 You just parked. Like, what use is that? 
 He doesn't even like this kind of music. 
 All right. All right, sister. 
 Well, drive.

 Don't know how you put up with her for so long, you know what I mean? 
 Her mouth is the only reason I'm not making a move there myself. 
 She's all right. 
 In the dark, maybe. 
 If you're deaf. 
 Shut up, will you? 
 But it's not as though... You know what I mean, once you've boned her, it's like, right, what have you got to talk about?

 Anything, really. 
 Anything at all. 
 Stop, stop, stop!

 Pull over. Just pull over here.

 Just pull over.

 It so definitely is. 
 Joe? 
 Joe! 
 Oh, my boy! 
 My boy. 
 Let me look at ya. 
 Oh, let me just look at you. 
 "My boy." 
 Yeah, you're my boy. 
 Oh, let me have a cuddle, come here. 
 Oh! 
 Top lad. 
 Top lad. What are you? 
 A top lad? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, you are. 
 We'll get the doc by to check him out, but he seems fine. 
 He can't tell us anything, but as far as we can make out he's nothing worse than cold and hungry. 
 Where did you find him? 
 At a bus stop. 
 At a bus stop? 
 Hey, now. Come here. 
 Now, what were you doing at a bus stop, eh? 
 Where were you going? 
 Hey, big fella. 
 How'd you get that far? 
 You must have Grandad's lungs. 
 [ALISON LAUGHS] 
 Thank you. 
 Me and you will talk again. 
 How do you mean? 
 Don't think that finding Joe makes you a good person. 
 It just makes you a twat who did a good thing. 
 What was that about? 
 Bit of old-school parenting. 
 We should get you inside. Come on, let's go home. 
 Let's get warm. 
 Come on. 
 Good job we found him when we did... 
 I think Bob Herd was about to go home and get his guitar. 
 Oh, God. 
 I blame you for this, you know. 
 All that hanging around at bus stops, you've given him ideas. 
 It was brilliant though, wasn't it, the fact that he thought of going to a bus stop? 
 On the wrong side of the road. 
 Can't have everything. 
 How do you know it was the wrong side of the road? 
 Maybe he was just trying to run away from this madhouse. 
 Fair point. 
 He wasn't running away, though, was he? He was just walking. 
 We all decided he was running away, but in his head he was just walking. 
 We're imposing our narrative on his inner state, which... we have no way of knowing anything about. 
 Anybody else feel like they've just walked into a cryptic crossword? 
 That's what happens when you try and raise the tone, Nicola. 
 Come on, then. 
 Come on, what did we sing? 
 Oh, I'm not telling you that. 
 That's not a fair question. 
 No, come on - what did we sing when we all ran out of Joe's songs? 
 Maurice? 
 Well, I might have dipped into me Sinatra repertoire in a particularly dark moment. 
 Christ, no wonder he's waiting for a bus to Kendal. 
 Will you put him to bed for me, love? 
 I just need to go and see someone. 
 Yeah. 
 [DOOR CLICKS SHUT] 
 [MUSIC SEEPS FROM HEADPHONES] 
 Hiya. 
 I'm really sorry that you had to go through that. 
 I'm sorry that Ralph had to go through that. 
 I'd have done the same. 
 Didn't stop me from hating you all for doing it. 
 Right. 
 Well, it's been a long day, you know...? 
 Look... 
 ...I hope my dad brings Joe round again. 
 Get to know you better. 
 And Ralph will always be welcome. 
 Yeah. 
 Because the village idiots have to stick together, right? 
 That isn't what I meant. 
 The angry villagers may not come to the door with pitchforks and torches any more... but just check out his Facebook page. It's a delight! 
 People will forget. 
 Yes, but he won't and I won't. 
 You've got a child that is different and that's always going to be there. 
 You've got a child that's different, Alison, so you know what I'm talking about. 
 Oh. 
 False alarm. 
 My period started. 
 Oh, right. 
 You're relieved, to be honest, hey? 
 Yeah. 
 You are relieved, aren't you? 
 Yeah, I am. 
 Sort of. 
 You didn't want to start a family right now, did you? 
 Ahem. 
 As displacement activities go, the dishwasher is a bit finite. 
 What I've got to say, there's just no way to say it. 
 Look, I know it's... 
 I know it wasn't planned. 
 I know it's scary. 
 I'm not scared. Not of fatherhood, at any rate. 
 OK... 
 I'm scared of what I thought when you told me. 
 Like what? 
 I thought, for a moment... I thought... 
 The very first thought I had when you told me... Am I the father? 
 Who else could be the father? 
 The dates. 
 When you went to Manchester to see Michael. The dates would fit, you know? 
 Michael. 
 You don't really think that, do you? 
 I don't, if I am being rational, I don't. 
 But that little doubt, that terrible, terrible idea just sweeps everything else away. 
 It just blocks out everything that's good about us. It kills everything. 
 When could this have happened? 
 When could this...? How could... how could I have slept with Michael? 
 And how can you think that about me after everything that we have done? 
 I don't want to be that kind of man, and I am. 
 I don't want to be in that kind of relationship. 
 I was looking at Ralph and all I could think was what if that was Joe, sitting there with a broken heart? 
 What if that was Joe wondering what he had done wrong? 
 What if that was Joe that had spent his life being told to trust the world, only to find that it didn't trust him back? 
 Well, we're just going to have to surround him with a family that loves him so much he won't know anything but love. 
 I think he's got more family than any child should be asked to cope with! 
 You know that thing I said? About not wanting to change him. 
 Yeah... 
 Well, I meant it when I said it. I don't think I think it now. 
 Well, I told God if he was safe I'd go to church for a year. 
 Am I allowed to break that one too? 
 No. 
 Perhaps you could mean it for just a bit longer, hey? 
 It feels like grief, doesn't it? Mm? 
 Well, that's the nearest I've had to just feeling... 
 Knowing that there's a boy in there that we could have had, but we didn't. 
 It feels like grief to me, anyway. 
 Eddie! Eddie, this is... 
 This is insane. 
 Everybody wants me to be strong and decisive. Well, here it is, me being strong and decisive. 
 I think you're confusing strong and decisive with stupid and impulsive. 
 When I fell in love with you, it's because you said things like that, and now it's things like that that drive me up the f*cking wall! 
 That can be a pattern in relationships that are going through problems. 
 And that, too. You're always on the outside commenting on our marriage, it never feels like you're actually inside it with me! 
 Eddie, please don't do this! 
 You know, if you want to move, we can move. 
 Do you really think that's what this is all about? Hmm? God. 
 You must think I am a bigger loser than I do.
