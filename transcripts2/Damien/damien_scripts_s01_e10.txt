 My boy... 
 What have they done to you? 
 To hell with you, John. 
 I know I couldn't tell you everything before, but you must believe me, it was for your own protection. 
 You see how much danger you're in. 
 I've always been on your side, paving the way so you could...

 It's a wound on the world. 
 A horrible death. 
 I thought, is this a punishment for me? 
 For her? 
 I'll never know. 
 And then I heard what you did. 
 I was sent here to investigate. 
 Investigators bring pens and notebooks. 
 Assassins carry daggers. 
 And the most clever murderers have no blood on their hands at all. 
 You sent your own daughter after me.

 You know how many deaths God's directly responsible for in The Bible? 
 The plagues, the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah. 
 Millions. 
 Do you know how many my Power is responsible for? 
 10, and most of those ordered by your God. 
 You serve a cruel lord who seeks only ignorance and His own glory. 
 Satan is the one who brings death and ignorance and darkness. 
 He... he turns away from the light, the love. 
 Repent. [Breathing heavily]

 Where would he go? 
 Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. 
 Your mother's still alive. 
 She lives outside Beirut, near your sisters, their husbands, and all their children. 
 It's nice to have such a large family.
