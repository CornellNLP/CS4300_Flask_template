 Previously on Damien... 
 Amani : Why'd you Photoshop her in here? 
 Damien : I didn't Photoshop her. She just appeared in them. 
 She must've been working on some kind of religious story. 
 These killings will stop now, even if I have to slit your throat to make them. 
 Good meeting? You have that look. 
 I have to celebrate. 
 There any good bars around here? 
 Wait, I... hey. 
 In the last few days, you've been in close proximity to a number of... unexplained deaths? 
 [GRUNTING] Hey! No! No! No! 
 I may not be able to prove it, but I know you're responsible for those deaths. 
 Out of the way! 
 Uhh! Aah! 
 No! Mommy! 
 You saved my son without even thinking. Thank you. 
 His father's in the Army, got injured in Iraq. 
 We were on our way back from the VA hospital. 
 Damien : There's always been something, like a dark cloud, hanging over me.

 It's, uh, it's good to see you. 
 My... my husband's a patient here. 
 Right. Uh, yes, he was, uh, injured in Iraq. 
 Uh, how's your boy? How's Tiago? 
 Uh, he's fine physically. 
 But falling on the tracks really shook him up. 
 Loud noises bother him. He's on edge. 
 Like father, like son. 
 Well, that was quite a scare, but I'm sure he'll bounce back. 
 Listen, Alex is upstairs. 
 Is there any chance you can come up and meet him? 
 I wouldn't want to bother him. 
 Please? 
 It would really make his day. 
 This is us. 
 Claudia? 
 Guess who I found downstairs. 
 Uh, Damien Thorn, the man who pulled Tiago from the train.

 You're a photographer, right? This is not my best side. 
 I should wait outside.

 What brings you to VA, huh? 
 There's a... there's a doc downstairs who... deals with PTSD. 
 Oh, no sh1t? Hope that train scare didn't rattle you. 
 No, no. Um, lot of other stuff. 
 I was in the field a long time. 
 The minute I got back to New York, I lost a good friend. 
 I went south from there. 
 I feel you. 
 How about you? How are they treating you here?

 I saw your photos of those guys in the 4th ID. 
 You were in the thick of it, right in the surge. 
 See, a lot of photographers, they stay out in the FOBs. 
 Looked like you were in a few convoys that took IEDS, huh? 
 Part of our group, uh, got hit coming back to the base, and we went out to retrieve them. 
 Driving through the trash, you know what that's like. 
 Told you. Garbage everywhere. So easy to hide explosives. 
 How about you? Uh... 
 How'd you end up in here? 
 I was on a routine house to house. 
 We'd been to that area before. 
 I was out in front. 
 We turned into the alleyway. 
 Torez went down. 
 Blood everywhere. 
 I pulled him to cover, got nailed under the collarbone. Shattered my spinal column. 
 [MACHINE BEEPS] 
 Torez was 22. 
 I know all about the guilt. 
 Yeah, feeling like you could have done more... that, uh... it should've been you.

 War was easy compared to this. 
 No matter how surreal it got, no matter how the rules broke down... 
 I knew how to handle it. 
 But this? 
 At least you got Claudia and Tiago. 
 That must keep you going. 
 This is killing them, too. 
 Claudia can't keep a job. 
 She's on all kinds of anti-anxiety pills, can't sleep. 
 Tiago's having his own issues. 
 Debts are piling up. We're losing our house. 
 Well, Veterans Affairs... are they no help? 
 My family would've been better off if I were killed over there. 
 Hey, listen, don't say that. 
 I know you're angry. I get it. I would be, too. 
 But... right now you have to focus on getting healthy, getting your life back. 
 I'm ending it. 
 What? 
 It's my only choice. 
 It's the... it's the best thing to do for everyone. 
 But you have a wife and... and kid. 
 In a few years, when I'm just skin and bones, can't move, can't care for myself, maybe she'd consider ending my suffering. 
 But right now it's... it's the elephant in the room. 
 You have a young son. He needs you. 
 I-I get it. It seems helpless, like you're staring down a long, dark tunnel, like you're alone. You're not. 
 You've survived so much already. 
 There's... there's a black market here. 
 Employees lift stuff from the pharmacy... morphine. 
 Plus, another guy... he did himself in a few weeks ago. 
 Plus, I've been stashing my painkillers. 
 I want you to photograph it. 
 Absolutely not. 
 You... you know how many vets take their own lives? 
 Yeah, of course I know. 
 The war... the war doesn't end over there. 
 People think that they can get by with a "thank you for your service." 
 I will publish these pictures this week. 
 I will get your story out. 
 Someone will help. 
 There's no help coming. 
 You know that. 
 I can't. 
 I've seen too much death. I've had it all around me. 
 I came here today because I can't handle it anymore. 
 I did not come here to assist a suicide. 
 You're a war photographer, aren't you? 
 Isn't... isn't that what you do? 
 Bear witness? Huh? 
 I'm just another casualty of war. 
 Please. 
 I'm... 
 [BED CREAKS] 
 I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm begging you. Please. 
 [CROWS CAWING] I don't know. I gotta think Damien's right. 
 There's an explanation for all of it. 
 For  all  it? 
 The notebook? The bird? Him never getting hurt? 
 Look, these coincidences are just that. 
 They're coincidences. 
 [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
 Are you trying to build a case? 
 What, you think Damien has something to do with Kelly's death, don't you? 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Look, you gotta be real careful. 
 You start throwing around accusations like that, you could ruin someone's life. 
 No one can disprove a negative. 
 Right? And he's tore up about the whole thing. 
 He's actually talking to someone about it now. 
 He's been miserable. 
 Do you remember that old woman in Damascus? 
 He even Photoshopped her into old family photos. 
 He needs our help, not our suspicion. 
 Do you have those photos? 
 Oh, they're in his apartment. 
 The old woman, she says all that Latin stuff. 
 And... and all of Kelly's religious notes? 
 This could mean something. 
 Just forget it. 
 Do you wanna go grab a bite to eat or something? 
 No. That's all right. I can't. I'm sorry. 
 Cool. That's... cool. 
 I will, uh, get out of your hair. 
 See ya. 
 See you.
