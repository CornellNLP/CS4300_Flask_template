 (screams) 
 Eve Winter : You can't have killed Karly. 
 She was your best friend and when she ran into you last week, you talked for hours. 
 You could be the only person that could help us find out who killed her. 
 If you could just remember what you talked about. Well, I can't. 
 OK? I can't remember anything. 
 Alesia Taylor : I know who Indiana is. 
 Catherine Ziegler. Ziegler? 
 I'm the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
 Indiana is my daughter from my first marriage. 
 She was completely off the rails. I was at my wit's end. 
 So, you sent her to live with the Johanssons? 
 How did you know them? 
 I have a friend in the police, Steve Wheeler. 
 We went to the academy together. 
 The victim's husband, Luke Thompson, is a fisherman. 
 Not much money in fish these days. 
 So, you think he's importing cocaine? 
 Yeah. Bringing it in on the boat. 
 (gunshots) 
 Police! Out of the way! Move! 
 Where are you taking Luke? 
 Luke's safe. 
 He's my suspect. I want to talk to him. 
 That's not going to happen, alright? 
 'Cause you wanted the feds in and now we're in, right? 
 So, Luke's with me. 
 Indiana : That's him. That's the guy who attacked me. 
 I'm not sticking around. 
 I'm getting my passport, get the ticket, then I'm out of here. 
 Lachlan Mckenzie : Here he is. 
 Come in. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Why didn't you tell us that you took Indiana Hope down to Rocky Point eight years ago? 
 Simple - I couldn't see how it was relevant to your investigation of Karly Johansson's murder. 
 Not your call, was it? 
 OK. 
 The truth is that Pete Ziegler wanted it kept strictly confidential. 
 I assumed that he hadn't changed his mind on that. 
 Oh, and now the fact he's DPP? 
 Yeah, way too powerful to have as an enemy. 
 I'm not an idiot, Lachlan. 
 Look, OK, anything you want to know, ask away. 
 Why the Johanssons? 
 Judith was active in the local community. 
 Karly and Indiana were about the same age. 
 I thought they'd be a good fit. 
 And Bjorn Johansson just agreed? 
 For 500 bucks a week, he jumped at the idea. 
 So, are we done? 
 Yeah. 
 Leave it with us. Thanks. 
 How's it going? 
 It's wide open. 
 Pagent didn't top himself. He was murdered. 
 Bullshit! He strung himself up. 
 No, bruising wasn't consistent with suicide. 
 Crime scene's over there now. 
 Mate, hope they don't catch you. Good luck with it. 
 (music plays) 
 I need to talk to her. 
 She's not here. Well, where is she? 
 I don't know. 
 You know it's not safe for her out on the streets. 
 Don't blame me. I was working. 
 (phone rings) 
 Oh, great. She just got bored. 
 Well, board can get you dead. Scare tactics don't work on us. 
 I promise you, Sharni, I just want to help her. 
 For Godsakes, she just went to get some books. 
 At the flat? 
 Yeah. 
 Indiana. 
 How many times do I have to say it? I don't want your help. 
 Do you know what happened today? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 A woman called Emma Tan was shot dead. 
 The feds think she's connected to Penny Bartok. 
 So? 
 So, she was dealing in drugs. 
 She was working with Karly's husband, Luke. 
 Does any of that sound familiar to you? 
 No! I told you, I can't remember. Do you want to get killed? 
 These people are not going to go away. 
 I just want to try and help you remember. 
 Have you ever been hypnotised before? 
 Most people find it a pleasant experience. 
 And don't worry, you can't be made to do anything you don't want to do, OK? 
 Are you ready? 
 I guess so. Mm-hm. 
 (phone buzzes) 
 OK, just relax and listen to my voice. 
 That's it. Focus on your breathing. Deep breaths. 
 Hey, do you know what's going on in the interview room? 
 Hypnosis. Indiana. 
 They're trying to recover her memories. 
 I want you to think back to the night you met Karly at the Cave Bar. 
 Do you think you can do that for me? 
 Mm-hm. 
 OK, great. 
 Now, just in your own time, just tell me what you remember. 
 (music plays) 
 (laughs) 
 (music plays) 
 It was great to see Karly. 
 It's been so long. 
 (music plays) 
 You sat and talked? 
 We talked for ages. 
 Do you remember what you talked about? 
 I think they are.  (laughs) 
 Lots of things. 
 So good to see her. 
 She showed me pictures of her kids. 
 What's wrong? 
 Indiana, can you talk to me? 
 (sobs) 
 Indiana, what did Karly get upset about? 
 (sobs) 
 I can't do this. 
 This is crap. What did you see? 
 Nothing. You remembered something. 
 Nothing! I can't do this. I'm out of here. 
 Indiana, I need to know what you saw. 
 Leave me alone! Eve, just... 
 (exhales) 
 God! 
 (exhales) 
 (phone rings) 
 Hello? 
 (over phone)  Hey. It's me. 
 Sorry to call so early. I need access to Luke Thompson. 
 Hang on, you interviewed Indiana yesterday without sending through a request, Eve. 
 (sighs) 
 Well, it must have got lost in the system. 
 Anyway, we tried hypnosis to see if she could remember anything... 
 What?.. about the Cave Bar. 
 Eve, you can't... 
 I should have been there for that. 
 Well, I'm briefing you now. 
 Fact is, I think she did remember something. 
 What? 
 Well, I don't know. 
 She got distressed and ran out. Great. 
 So, what are you going to do now? 
 Well, I'm just going to give her some space. 
 I was giving her some space, Eve. 
 Anyway, back to Luke Thompson. I really need to interview him. 
 Luke Thompson's not talking, alright? He's lawyered up. 
 Well, maybe you're asking the wrong questions. 
 Hey, have you got any idea what time it is? 
 Great. So, you won't mind if we have a go at him, then? 
 It's really not going to matter what I say, is it? 
 So...  (chuckles)  .. go for your life, Eve. Just go back to sleep. 
 (phone beeps)  Good morning to you too. 
 How's it going at the Pagent house? 
 Forensics are still going over the place with a fine-toothed comb. 
 Yeah? They asked you to get out of their way. 
 What? No. 
 They called you? 
 Politely requested you let them do their job. 
 There's Luke. 
 Well, just make sure we don't talk to anyone. 
 Oh, here we go. 
 Morning, Luke. We need to ask you a few questions. 
 My client has nothing further to say, Detective. 
 This isn't about the coke, Luke. That's a matter for the feds. 
 Well, my client wasn't aware of any cocaine. 
 No, of course he wasn't. 
 We're not interested in that. 
 We'd like to talk to you in connection to the murder of your wife. 
 She was so beautiful. 
 She was way out of my league, I thought, but you don't get to choose who you fall in love with, do you? 
 No, you don't. And she picked me. 
 Go figure. 
 It was like winning the lottery. 
 She was the love of my life. 
 I didn't kill her and if I knew who did, I would tell you. 
 OK. 
 You want me to tell you who I think did it? 
 Either the people you're working for or a rival drug cartel making a bid to take over the business. 
 I'll start a bid. 
 Mr Thompson is a simple fisherman. 
 He denies any involvement with illicit drugs. 
 There's a good chance they've got a bullet for you too, Luke. 
 OK, you're trying to intimidate my client. 
 This conversation is over. Hang on. 
 Have you got proof of that? 
 Got Emma's body in the morgue. 
 Do you need any more proof than that? 
 I don't care what happens to me. 
 Well, that's a cop-out, isn't it? 
 What about your kids? 
 It's going to be hard enough for Faith and Lilly without their mum. 
 You need to do the right thing by them, Luke. 
 Who else is involved? 
 We need names, Luke. 
 To catch Karly's killer, we need names. 
 Do not respond to that. 
 Naming people involved in drug importation can only incriminate you. 
 You want names? 
 Yes. 
 Luke, I strongly recommend... Shut up, Greta! 
 (inhaler puffs) 
 Bjorn. 
 What about him? 
 You want names, you go to Bjorn. How is Bjorn involved? 
 It's his operation. 
 He's been running drugs for years. 
 Oh, for Godsakes! Can't you just leave us in peace? 
 And good afternoon to you too. 
 You can't come barging into my house like this. 
 This warrant says we can, Mr Johansson. 
 We're here to conduct a legal search for prohibited narcotics, quantities of cash, financial records, computers - anything that may be used in relation to criminal activities. 
 I've just lost a daughter. You have no idea, you b*st*rd! 
 We know about the drugs, Mr Johansson. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I'm a fisherman. 
 The people you've been dealing with are very likely responsible for Karly's death. 
 What?! Oh, my God! 
 You don't owe them any loyalty. If you give us some names, then we'll take your cooperation into consideration. 
 You get out of my house. Get out! 
 In accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Act, Mr Johansson, if you are found guilty, your house, your car, everything you own, will be confiscated. 
 You will die, but your family will be on the streets. 
 Why don't you just make yourself at home? 
 Lauren? 
 Did you know about the drugs? 
 That's one of the reasons I moved out of home. 
 I'm a teacher, for God's sake. 
 I swear to you, I have never been involved with Dad's little earner. 
 OK. 
 Is that why Karly was killed? 
 It's a theory we're investigating. 
 Well, it makes sense, doesn't it? 
 Everything in life comes at a price. 
 I can't... I can't imagine how scared she must have been. 
 Lauren, this could end really badly for your parents. 
 Can you try and talk to your dad, see if you can get him to cooperate? 
 My whole life, he's never listened to me. 
 He's not about to start now. 
 (sighs) 
 Any luck with Bjorn? 
 No, he's not talking. There's a surprise. 
 Any plans to change his mind? 
 Maybe. Won't be pretty, though. 
 He doesn't care what we do to him. So...? 
 So, we arrest Judith. 
 He might just talk to save her. 
 What, have you got anything on her? 
 Well, there's the traces of cocaine in the family safe. 
 Well, that's traces. 
 That's hardly enough for a possession charge. 
 No, but you've got enough for conspiracy to import. 
 We serve the dead, Jake. That's why we're here. 
 (coughs) 
 Get your bloody hands off my wife. 
 No need to arrest her. You've got nothing. 
 Well, this is your doing, Mr Johansson. 
 You have the power to fix it. 
 Milo : Ledger books going back years and a couple of bank statements in two different names. 
 Possible fake accounts for laundering dirty money. 
 And this is the bank that Karly used to work at? 
 Mm-hm. 
 We may have just found the evidence we've been looking for. 
 You can say goodbye to everything. 
 You bastards! 
 Last chance, Mr Johansson. 
 We want the names of the people who paid you. 
 OK, take her out. 
 Judith : Bjorn! 
 Tell them! Oh, look, for Godsakes! Get her out. 
 Bjorn, tell them. Bjorn! 
 Have it your way. 
 If I give you what you want... 
 .. I'll get what I want. 
 Which is...? 
 No-one in my family gets charged and we get to keep what's ours. 
 I don't have the authority to make that deal. 
 Then speak to someone who does. 
 And I want it in writing. 
 Eve Winter. So pleased to finally meet you. 
 Tamara Davis, Deputy DPP. Hi. 
 I've seen you around, of course, but we've never actually met, have we? 
 No. No. This is long overdue. 
 Detective Sergeant McKenzie. 
 Miss Davis. 
 What's going on? 
 The DPP's ready. Let's go. 
 Full immunity for his family and a guarantee we won't go after their assets as proceeds of crime? 
 How about we throw in a set of steak knives as well? 
 I know it's an ask, but they're just the delivery men. 
 Yeah, without whom, the drugs never would have made landfall. 
 Do not downplay their role in this, Detective. 
 The simple fact is, this is our best chance at getting those responsible for the murders of Karly Johansson and Emma Tan. 
 What's Federal Police's take on this? 
 Well, given our case against the Johanssons isn't the strongest and Bjorn's long-term prognosis is poor... 
 From my understanding, he only has weeks to live. 
 Is that right? 
 It is. 
 Then we're happy to accept a deal. It's not that simple. 
 We need to get a signed statement verified, get him before the magistrate. 
 If we don't and he dies, his evidence is inadmissible and this deal will come back to haunt us. 
 We could do a bedside committal. 
 If we video his statement and have a magistrate there to witness it, I mean, that would solve any admissibility issue. 
 Alright, but I can't sign off without running it past the minister's office. 
 They are paranoid about being seen as going soft on drug dealers, especially in today's climate. 
 OK, how about I make a call and we'll see how we go? 
 Given Bjorn's health, we don't really have a minute to lose. 
 Right? 
 That's right. 
 OK, the DPP's on his way to Macquarie Street. 
 We should have an answer for you by the morning. 
 Great. Thanks. Yeah, no worries. 
 Who's up for a drink? 
 Um, maybe some other time. 
 Detective? 
 Why not? 
 Great. 
 See you tomorrow. Yeah, enjoy. 
 Now, just so we're clear, whatever we get from Bjorn Johansson, the priority is still Karly's murder, right? 
 Well, I get that's your priority, but I've invested too much time and money not to act on any new information so... 
 You wouldn't be getting any information if it wasn't for... 
 Your strategy. Agreed. 
 So, let's make a deal, alright? 
 I'll keep you fully briefed on our investigation if you do the same on yours. 
 That's a really good deal. Yeah, OK. It's a deal. 
 (phone rings) 
 I've got to take this. 
 
 
 
 Eve! Martin, hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Oh, I've just been in court wearing my expert witness hat. 
 Ah. And a very nice suit. 
 You're looking sharp. Thank you. You too. 
 Thanks. 
 Sorry we're keeping you so busy these days. 
 Oh, it has its upside - I get to see more of you. 
 Do you know what we should do? 
 What's that? 
 Catch up for a drink. 
 Actually, why don't we make it dinner? 
 Have a fun night? 
 Oh, I think you'd be pretty disappointed with my idea of a fun night. 
 I can't see how, so long as it involves you. 
 Jake, do you remember Martin Jenkins? 
 Um, how are you, mate? Keeping busy? 
 Yeah, we've just had that conversation. 
 Can I have a word? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, you guys are working? 
 Mm-hm. 
 I'll get out of your way. Keep that offer in mind. 
 Hey, I just got some new information on Emma Tan. 
 What is it? 
 Well, I can't tell you in here. It's classified. 
 Not there.  (cat miaows) 
 So, you've got access to AGO files? 
 If I ask nicely, yes. Oh, God! 
 Anyway, Emma Tan, alright? 
 Now, she's made 10 trips to South-East Asia in the last three years, alright? 
 She's been to Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and this is where she's getting the girls for the s*x trade. 
 So, human trafficking? 
 Yeah. Let me guess. 
 For Penny Bartok? 
 That's the theory. 
 Now, we've got no proof that's going to stand up in court, but she has been working for her on several fronts. 
 Valuable player, then? 
 And also a dangerous one. 
 She tries to cut a deal to save her own skin. 
 Which suggests that Bartok knew that she was about to be arrested, then. 
 Well, we suspect that she's had informants in several of the agencies. 
 Ours included and probably yours as well. 
 That explains why she's always one step ahead. 
 You know what they say - everyone's got their price. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 So, what else have you got on Emma? 
 Um, Emma? She's got no family, no lover. 
 She doesn't even have a cat. I don't have a cat either. 
 (miaows) 
 That's not mine. Right. 
 Anyway, the techies are trawling through her electronics, but nothing useful yet. 
 She had expensive taste in shoes. She drove a nice car. 
 I doubt there will be a big turnout at her funeral. 
 Well, that's sad. Yeah. 
 Cheers. Cheers. 
 This is very good, by the way. Mm. 
 Well, life's too short to drink bad wine. 
 My thoughts exactly. 
 Life's too short to do a lot of things we should do. 
 Or shouldn't. 
 (phone rings) 
 I should get that. Yeah, you should. 
 Hello. 
 Yeah, OK. I'm on my way. 
 I have to go. Mm. That's OK. 
 We're still fielding a lot of heat from yesterday. 
 There we go. Take your wine. 
 No, it's OK. You can have the wine. 
 Just... save it till next time. 
 Hope Ziegler kicks a goal, eh? 
 Morning. Morning. 
 What's...? 
 Um, it's a personal call. 
 So, Milo and I spoke to Romain Gellar again last night. 
 The bank accounts are very possibly bogus, which suggests laundering of drug money, but they weren't opened by Karly. 
 They're all really old, opened before all the identity checks that we've got today. 
 Karly would have still been at school. 
 What about Judith? 
 I'm going to have another go at her. 
 I figure it can't hurt to try and we might get something. 
 Good luck. Thanks. 
 Sally, for the hundredth time, I will call Mia and apologise for missing her concert. 
 I can't do anything more than that. You know what this job's like. 
 Yeah, well... 
 (sighs)  Look, I've got to go, OK? 
 Bye. 
 Are you alright? 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I just needed a bit of privacy in a hurry. 
 I've just been spending a lot of time with the kids lately and Sally... 
 .. well, she just took things the wrong way, imagined a future that's just not going to happen. 
 She doesn't know about Tammy, then? 
 Oh, God, no. 
 What's that? 
 Janet Pagent case files for Detective McKenzie. 
 Just put them on my desk on the end there, thanks. 
 Well, that lot'll keep you busy. Yeah. 
 Any news from the DPP? 
 Not yet. 
 Fingers crossed. 
 I have never been so humiliated in all of my life. 
 Well, you should have thought about that before you got involved in illegal drugs. 
 I know nothing about that. Nothing! Really? 
 Anything? 
 Do you enjoy being such a bitch? 
 Just abuse. Nothing useful. 
 Make sure she's ready to travel as soon as we get the green light. 
 Will do. 
 A word, boss? 
 I've been in touch with some of my mates in drugs, just seeing what they had on Emma Tan and Luke Thompson. 
 Wheeler said they had nothing. 
 Yeah, that's right, but take a look at this. 
 That's your nephew Harry, isn't it? 
 Where did you get these? 
 It's a known drug house in Newtown. 
 They ID'd your nephew as a customer, not as one of their targets. 
 Do they know what he was buying? 
 Only a small quantity of weed, but these guys deal in speed, eccies, crystal meth. 
 This one's taken two Thursdays ago. 
 And this one last Thursday. 
 He nicks out of school at recess and buys weed for his mates. 
 You shouldn't be telling me this. 
 I just thought you'd want to know. 
 Today's Thursday. 
 I know what day it is, Milo. I can't know this. 
 They're planning a raid. 
 When? 
 10:30. 
 sh1t! 
 Eve! Eve! Is it important? 
 Yes, it is. Look, I might have found something. 
 Here. Janet Pagent's work diary. Look. 
 This meeting was scheduled with Bjorn the day after she was murdered. 
 The school was conducting parent/teacher meetings at the time. 
 We interviewed him, but no red flag. However, knowing what we know now... 
 Oh, well, we'll ask him when we do the recorded interview. 
 I want to jump on this and head down there now. No, no. 
 Look, Ziegler might not even sign off on the deal. 
 If you head down there and put pressure on her, he might just tell her to take a hike. 
 Just wait. OK. OK. Alright. OK. OK. 
 Can't hurt to wait. Where are you going? 
 Personal matter. 
 Just buzz me if Ziegler calls, OK? 
 (horn honks) 
 Get in the car. Eve? 
 Harry, get in the car or so help me, I'll... 
 What the hell do you think you were doing? 
 Nothing. You were going to buy drugs. 
 No, I wasn't. 
 Yes, you were and you would have been arrested. 
 I'm sorry. Don't. Don't even. 
 See? 
 Melanie : I appreciate you saving his arse, but let's face it, all kids experiment with grass. 
 I did. You did. 
 No, I didn't. 
 No, of course you didn't. 
 Got anything to eat? 
 Help yourself. 
 That's not the point. Harry is 14. 
 I know how old my son is, Eve. 
 I'm nearly 15. 
 This goes to a pattern of behaviour. He's already had one warning. 
 Oh, here we go. I was waiting for this. 
 Waiting for what? 
 This isn't about Harry at all. 
 This is about me being a bad parent. 
 This isn't about you, Mel. 
 You know, it is so easy for you to just stand there on the sidelines and criticise. 
 I'm not! Yes, you are. 
 You have no idea how difficult it is to raise a child on your own. 
 Oh, don't I? 
 Who do you think looked after you after Dad killed himself? 
 Because it wasn't our mother. 
 (phone rings) 
 And I just put my career on the line for you. 
 Got any Vegemite or anything? 
 Eve Winter. 
 OK, so, you'll travel with a magistrate and your video of Bjorn's statement. 
 I'm so sorry I'm late. 
 Peter Ziegler : Nice of you to join us, Detective. 
 It's got our green light. 
 That's great. Thank you. 
 As I was saying, so, you'll travel with the magistrate and your video of Bjorn's statement. 
 Here's hoping you get the breakthrough you need. 
 I've got to rally the troops. 
 Can I grab a word, Detective? 
 See you later. 
 I know that you think I was a bad father, Detective. 
 Look, my personal opinion... Is irrelevant. 
 But I just want to make the point, it took me most of the night to get this deal done. 
 The minister took a lot of convincing. 
 I appreciate the effort. 
 I didn't make it home to see my family. 
 Sadly, that's pretty common in this job, but I believe what I do is important. 
 I believe that I make our society a safer place for everyone's kids, as I'm sure you believe you do too. 
 Yes, I do. 
 So, perhaps we're more alike than you care to admit. 
 Good day, Detective. 
 You took your bloody time. 
 (air hisses) 
 Got your bullshit meter ready? 
 If he tries to snow us, there's no deal. 
 Mr Johansson? 
 Lauren? 
 Mr Johansson? 
 Bjorn? 
 Oh, no! 
 No! 
 What's wrong? What's happened? 
 Daddy? 
 (sobs)  No! 
 You people, you killed him! Are you happy now? Go on! Get out! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Convenient. Maybe. 
 What the hell happened? 
 Someone got to him first. 
 So, in other words, you guys stuffed up. 
 How's your boss? 
 He's ballistic. 
 Martin : Eve! 
 You were right to be suspicious. 
 My preliminary findings tell me this is not death by cancer. 
 What was it, then? 
 Well, the late Mr Johansson has ruptured blood vessels on his eyelids and behind his ears. 
 Meaning...? 
 He was suffocated. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, someone knew he was going to talk. 
 Who knew we were coming. 
 I know the DPP office were keeping it close to their chest. 
 One or two people in the minister's office. 
 Your fed friend. 
 Or... 
 One of our people. 
 What do you want to do? 
 Keep eyes on everyone, I guess. 
 I need to ring Jake. 
 Why? 
 Get Indiana into protective custody. 
 I thought she wasn't going to testify. 
 Yeah, well, they don't know that. She's their last remaining threat. 
 (music plays) 
 Ow! What are you doing? 
 Going insane. 
 I need to get some money, get out of this place. 
 Well, you can always come back to work. 
 No, I'm still covered in bruises. 
 Hello! Make-up! 
 I don't do tricks anymore. 
 Not after what I saw at the pop-ups. 
 You know this place isn't like that. 
 It's safe. It's easy money.  (phone rings) 
 And how else are you going to get the fare? 
 Hello? 
 Indiana, it's Eve Winter. I've got a proposition for you. 
 Does it include an airfare to London? 
 Afraid not. 
 Then I'm not interested. 
 Good news is she's still at the brothel. 
 Paris would be nice. Yeah, in my dreams. 
 Sharni, got a client asking for you, darl. 
 Cool. 
 Easy money. 
 Hi, sweetie. My name's Sharni. You asked about me? 
 I did. Hi. Hi. 
 Have I seen you before, sweetie? 
 No. 
 I've just heard very good things about you. 
 (laughs)  That's good to hear. 
 So, how long would you like? 
 An hour gets you complimentary spa and champagne. 
 I was actually hoping for a double. Fantastic. 
 Anyone in mind? 
 I sure do. 
 Who? 
 Indiana. 
 Where is she? 
 I don't know! 
 Yes, you do!  (screams) 
 Where's Indi? 
 Gone to the Cross. 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Leave him! 
 Indi, quick. Come on. You've got to get out of here. 
 What's wrong? 
 They're after you. Come on. 
 Who is? 
 Some guy. Just get on. 
 Cops? 
 Definitely not cops. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Your phone! Your phone! 
 It's alright, I'm police. 
 What happened? 
 Got blindsided. 
 Oh, Jesus. Where's Indiana? 
 She's not here. She left already. Left to go where? 
 I don't know. She went up the Cross, I think. 
 Did you see who did this? 
 Some guy. 
 He went after Sharni. 
 OK, I've got a clear signal. She must be within 20 metres. 
 I can't see her. 
 Getting stronger. 
 Yeah, that guy's got it. 
 Hey! What are you doing? 
 It's alright, mate. 
 She's the police. Where did you get this? 
 Some chick on a Vespa dropped it. 
 I'm just trying to find her. Oh, you're trying to find her? 
 Where did she go? 
 She jumped on a scooter and went down Roslyn Street or whatever it's called. 
 I don't know. She went down there. 
 sh1t! 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, you're back. 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing? 
 I just thought a fresh pair of eyes on this Pagent stuff wouldn't hurt. 
 Thanks, but I've got this covered. 
 No worries. Just trying to help. 
 (clears throat) 
 Where are you going to go? 
 I don't know. Anywhere. 
 You need to get away too. Me? 
 They're going to come looking for me here and when they do... 
 sh1t! 
 OK, so... so, let's go together. 
 No, it's too risky. 
 You'll be fine. Just lay low for a day or so. 
 So, are you ever coming back? 
 I can't. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'll get in touch, just not for a while. 
 Give me some time to get my stuff together. 
 I'll give you a call. Take this. 
 No, I can't. 
 Yeah, you can. It's, like, 600 bucks in there. 
 Just pay me back whenever. 
 Take it. 
 I wish I had something I could give you. 
 We're on our way to her flat now. 
 And update the alert on the attacker - last seen King's Cross, Victoria Street. 
 Approach with extreme caution. 
 Jake : That's Indi. 
 There she is. 
 She's on Sharni's bike. 
 That's him. That's him. 
 (siren wails) 
 OK, we need backup and vehicle intercept. 
 A silver coup registration AH81RA. 
 Driver wanted for attempted murder. Considered armed and dangerous. 
 He's trying to hit her. He's trying to hit her. 
 OK, heading east on Nicholson Street towards Dowling. 
 Request immediate backup. 
 Repeat backup. Where's she going? 
 (car engine revs) 
 Go, go, go, go, go! I'm going! I'm going! 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 (crashing)  Jesus, no! 
 No! 
 Indi? Indi? 
 Oh, God. It's Sharni. 
 Sharni? Sharni, can you hear me? 
 We need an ambulance on the corner of Maclean and Wilson Street, Woolloomooloo now. 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 (siren wails in distance) 
 (sobs) 
 (knock at door) 
 We let her down. 
 Yeah, we did. 
 Can I come in?
