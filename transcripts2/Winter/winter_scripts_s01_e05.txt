 No! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Karly Johansson, mother of two. 
 I don't remember anything about the last three days. 
 You can't do this. 
 Indiana, I need to know what you saw. 
 Leave me alone! 
 We'll find out. 
 Paul Pagent launched a harassment complaint against Detective Sgt McKenzie two days before his murder. 
 We are looking at the professional standard of your investigation. 
 There he is! 
 And in particular, the role of the senior officers running it. 
 We have ID on our hit man, Edward John Duca, aka Eddie Duca. 
 Indiana, where are you? 
 I'll meet you. 
 Only you. 
 Here's your room. Shower down the hall. 
 You've got good security, you're safe here. 
 This lady here is Penny Bartok, she runs pop-up brothels. 
 By the time we find out where they are, they're gone. 
 Where does Indiana fit in? Was she working for Bartok? 
 Originally, yeah. 
 I know professional standards have been giving you a hard time. 
 Zeigler's pretty much at the heart of it all. 
 How is my boss to blame? 
 His daughter is. 
 It quotes a source within your department, Detective. 
 The Premier's office. They want to see you in person. 
 Took a phone call the day before Paul Pagent was murdered from the phone used to call Eddie Duca. 
 I need to eliminate you as a suspect. 
 Me? 
 Took a call from you around the same time. It's in my daybook. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Eve : (ON PHONE) Lachlan. What's going on? 
 Lachlan. 
 Lachlan, talk to me! 
 (SIRENS WAILING) 
 Stay with me. Stay with me. 
 Come on, stay with me. 
 I need to use your phone. 
 It'll have to be quick. 
 Thanks. 
 Sally? 
 Ah, Eve. 
 Oh, my God, is he...? No, no, he's... 
 Sally, he's still in surgery. 
 I was checking on the kids when I got the call. 
 Come and sit down. 
 I don't understand! How can this happen? 
 We don't know. 
 No matter what Lachlan and I have been through, he's a wonderful father. 
 I just can't... imagine him... 
 They said that he was in the car park, next to his car. 
 Yeah, I was on the phone when it happened. 
 You were speaking to him? So, do you know who shot him? 
 No, all I heard were the gunshots. 
 What was he working on? Was he meeting somebody? 
 I don't know. 
 Why not? 
 Sally, I can assure you, we're doing everything we can. 
 Don't you dare do that! 
 Don't you dare give me the official line. 
 I know the drill. You have nothing, do you? 
 You know I can't discuss that with you. 
 Why can't you? 
 You're the head of this investigation, aren't you? 
 Yes, I'm the head of this investigation. 
 Excuse me? 
 Boss, what can I do? 
 Check with uniforms. 
 I don't care if you have to doorknock every building in the entire city, find me a witness. 
 You want me to log that phone? 
 No, it's alright, I'll do it. 
 You know, I want to find the b*st*rd who did this but if you've lost your faith in me... 
 Would I have any reason to? 
 No. 
 Check all his calls. 
 Incoming, outgoing texts. 
 Do you know what he was working on before he left the squadron? 
 He was going through the Paul Pagent murder files. 
 I want them locked in my office. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Boss. Any news? 
 Eve : He's still in theatre. 
 How did you go with the witness statements from Chinatown? 
 They all say pretty much the same thing. 
 Milo was seen chasing Duca. 
 But we do have one witness from an adjoining building see Duca term and attack Detective Lee. 
 There was a fight and Duca fell. 
 Milo's not at fault. 
 OK, right. 
 Do a check on all of Duca's previous arrests. 
 Go back to his juvenile records, look for any names that appear more than once. 
 Got it. 
 Whoever did this is panicking right now. 
 Panicking? 
 Shooting Lachlan wasn't smart, it was desperate. 
 How's Indiana? 
 She's asleep. She has no idea what happened. 
 No idea about what? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How you holding up? 
 OK. 
 Hmm? 
 I've got something I need to tell you. 
 I have Indiana. 
 Since when? 
 Two nights ago. 
 Do you know how many places I've tried to find her. 
 She's scared, Jake. She doesn't trust anyone? 
 What about you? 
 What? 
 Well, who do you trust? 
 It's not that I don't trust you, I just... 
 The other night at your place, the call from work, that was her? 
 That was her? 
 f*ck... 
 She wouldn't come in unless I kept it secret. 
 It was the only way to keep her safe. 
 I know I should have told you. 
 Yeah, used should have told me, right. She's my witness. 
 I want to talk to her. 
 Not until I do. 
 Just wait. 
 (PHONES RING) 
 Will someone get that phone, please? 
 Eve. I'm so sorry. 
 Can I have everyone's attention, please? 
 Detective Sgt McKenzie has come out of surgery. 
 (APPLAUSE) 
 The next 48 hours will be critical. 
 He was shot twice, once in the chest. 
 The bullets have been sent to forensics. 
 Meanwhile, we've got a lot to follow up on. 
 Any information anyone has, I want shared. 
 Any lead, no matter how small, goes on that wall until it can be eliminated. 
 If anyone's got any suspicions who might have shot Detective McKenzie, anything that he might have mentioned in passing, don't hold back. 
 I want logbooks, calendars, phone calls triple checked. 
 I don't need to remind you how crucial this is. 
 Detective McKenzie was shot for a reason and I want to know what that was. 
 Witnesses? 
 With any luck. 
 I can take over if you want to go home and get some rest. 
 No, I'm good, thanks. 
 So, can you describe the man you saw? 
 Uh... He was tall. 
 Not that tall. 
 Yeah, he was. 
 Not as tall as like a basketball player. 
 Was he as tall as the detective here? 
 Um, yeah, about that. 
 Did he say anything? 
 No, he sort of just pushed past us on the stairs. 
 Is there anything in particular you remember about him? 
 Did he have a beard, glasses? 
 No. 
 And you didn't hear the gunshots before that? 
 We thought it was fireworks. 
 We didn't even see the guy who got shot. 
 Wish we did, though. It would be pretty awesome. 
 Is that his blood? 
 We're going to need you to provide a description to a police artist. 
 Do you think you can do that? 
 Yes. 
 Thanks for coming in. This is our forensic artist. 
 She will make a composite picture from your descriptions. 
 Take all the time you need. Fantastic, come with me. 
 Data came back on Detective McKenzie's phone calls. 
 There's nothing to suggest he was meeting anyone. 
 One of his last calls was to the DPP's office. 
 There's also text messages on his mobile to and from the assistant DPP. 
 Tammy Davis? 
 They're of a personal nature, boss. 
 I'm sure they are. 
 Ms Davis? 
 If this is about the story in the media about Zeigler... 
 No, are you aware that Lachlan's been shot? 
 Yes, of course. 
 I called the hospital and they said he's out of surgery. 
 There's no point in me hanging out in the corridor drinking bad coffee with his ex-wife. 
 No, of course not. 
 What can I do for you, Detective? 
 You're one of the last people to speak to Lachlan. 
 I need to know what was said. 
 Nothing that'll help you find out who shot him. 
 If you'd let me determine that, please. 
 I called him to apologise for using our pillow talk when he told me about Zeigler's daughter. 
 And I hoped that it wouldn't affect what we had together. 
 That's it? 
 He said that he'd come by later and I could make it up to him. 
 Do you know where he was going? 
 Who he was meeting? 
 No. I didn't ask. 
 I understand this must be difficult for you. 
 Excuse me? 
 It's well known that you and Lachlan were an item years back. 
 Some people have trouble letting go. 
 How did you go? Did you find anything useful? 
 You tell me. 
 Oh! 
 Dead spit. 
 Well, I may be a bit younger and better looking but... 
 Anyway, I'll take it from here, Detective. 
 Winter'll ask people how to brief before it gets distributed. 
 Can you send it through to me? 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 You and Karly must have been close? 
 Catching up after all those years. 
 Talking for ages, like it was yesterday. 
 When I get together with my girlfriends, we talk about work. 
 Who we've been dating. 
 That's not what we talked about. 
 So you can remember the conversation? 
 A little. 
 It won't help your case. 
 How did you go with Duca's juvenile record? 
 I put in a request. 
 I think the hypnosis may have triggered something but she's still not talking. 
 Did you get any sleep at the hospital? 
 No. 
 If you like, I can answer all your calls and wake you up if there's anything... 
 No, no, I'm just here to change my clothes. 
 I'm sorry about the other detective. 
 Is he going to be OK? 
 I hope so. 
 Was he shot because of me? 
 (SOBS) 
 (KNOCKING) 
 That night at the Cave Bar. 
 I remember what I told Karly. 
 I know what made her so upset. 
 I hadn't seen Karly is about eight years. 
 Not since I left Rocky Point. 
 Then suddenly, there she was. 
 Karly? 
 Indy? 
 Oh, my God! 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Look at you! (GIGGLES) 
 You look so cool. I mean, like hot! 
 She told me how she married Luke and had two kids. 
 Couldn't believe it. 
 Karly, a mum. 
 (LAUGHS) That's Faith, that's Lily. 
 Look at how cute they are! 
 I know, they're gorgeous, take after me. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 How is your mum? 
 Um... 
 Yeah, no, she's not great. 
 Dad's got lung cancer. 
 Doctors have given him three months, tops. 
 My mum's taking it pretty rough. 
 Indy : It was weird. 
 I couldn't speak. 
 I couldn't say I was sorry to hear it or I was sad for anything. 
 I just sat there. 
 Indy, what's wrong? 
 What's the matter? 
 What's the matter? Did I say something to upset you? 
 Your dad raped me. 
 I just blurted it out. 
 We'd been down the beach for a swim. 
 Bjorn followed me into my room. 
 It was all over very quickly. 
 I didn't scream or do anything. 
 Did you tell anyone? 
 School counsellor. 
 Janet Pagent. 
 Did she report it? 
 I told her not to. 
 I didn't want anyone else to know. 
 I stayed with the Johanssons another week or so but I was terrified he was going to do it again, so... 
 And I couldn't tell Karly and Emma. 
 They'd both been so good to me. 
 I just made an excuse. 
 You told them you had a job in the city. 
 I... went to see my dad. 
 Told him what happened and he... 
 He didn't believe me. 
 He said I was making it up to cause trouble. 
 Told me to stop bothering him. 
 He didn't want me coming round to the house. 
 He had a new family to project. 
 From me. 
 Why didn't you say anything? Ugh! 
 I didn't trust anyone. 
 Where did you get this? 
 Karly's daughter, Faith. 
 It's a reminder of what those little girls have lost. 
 I didn't know where it came from. 
 So you could have gone back to Rocky Point with Karly? 
 I don't know. 
 Indy... 
 Well, I'm not lying. Those days are a complete blank. 
 Don't you think I want to remember? 
 I want to know who killed Karly as much as you do. 
 I did not abandon my child. 
 I did my very best to do whatever I could to help her. 
 But when drugs are involved, no father wants to see his child suffer. 
 I called this media interview today to explain my situation and to stop further innuendo and gossip. 
 Now please, I'd ask that you respect my privacy and leave me and my family alone. 
 Indiana, if you're watching, I forgive you. 
 Thank you. 
 Your very best. 
 You sure about that, Mr Zeigler? 
 Detective Winter, what is it now? 
 Detective Sgt Winter. 
 I'd like to talk to you about your daughter's rape and the subsequent cover-up. 
 What? There's no cover-up. 
 Indiana is prone to exaggeration. 
 I stopped believing her lies long ago. 
 Well, I don't believe she's lying. 
 What do you want? 
 Everything you know about Bjorn Johansson. 
 I've told you what I know. I've never even met the man. 
 Were you ever contacted by Janet Pagent? 
 Who? 
 The school counsellor. 
 No. Talk to Wheeler, he can fill you in on these details. 
 Aren't you even going to ask? 
 About Indiana. 
 Steve, this is Eve Winter. Call me as soon as you get this message. 
 (CELL PHONE CHIMES) 
 Officer. 
 How is he? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 Still in recovery, from what I'm told. 
 Oh. You look as though you could use a break. 
 I'm going to be here for a while. 
 Why don't you duck off and grab a coffee? 
 I'm not allowed to leave my post, sir. 
 Right answer! 
 (SIGHS) You're a tough b*st*rd to kill, McKenzie. 
 
 
 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Steve? 
 Detective Lee. 
 Tragedy, isn't it? 
 Well, let's hope not. 
 Makes you wonder though, doesn't it? 
 Could be any one of us going out to meet a suspect. 
 Not knowing if this is the guy that's going to pull the trigger. 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Oh, we're old mates, Lachy and I. 
 Just wanted him to know that I won't rest until I get the b*st*rd. 
 But I guess he already knows that. 
 What about you? 
 I've got some info for Detective Winter. 
 She said she'd be here. 
 Well, I can take it for her. No, it's alright. 
 Heading back to the station? 
 Yeah. 
 Got a few leads to check on. 
 Thanks. 
 Look, I didn't know about the rape. 
 She had no reason to tell you. 
 You weren't investigating that. 
 Still need her to testify, Eve. 
 Right now she feels safe, Jake. 
 She's not safe, Eve. 
 The only way she's going to be safe is she gives her testimony at a committal hearing and Penny Bartok is brought to trial. 
 The trial could drag on for years. 
 Tear her to shreds and you know it. 
 Well, what's the alternative? 
 You going to keep her hidden at your house? For how long? 
 Look, I know you want to keep her safe, I understand that. 
 But what about all these other girls that Bartok brings on a student visa? 
 Some of them were as young as 13. 
 She dopes them up, she puts them to work in the brothel and if there are lucky, they get deported back to their own country riddled with STDs and with a raging drug habit. 
 Yeah, alright. 
 OK. 
 I'm not going to stand in your way but it has to be her choice. 
 (BEEPS) 
 Bartok : (ON INTERCOM) Who is it? 
 Wheeler. 
 (BUZZES) 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 I need to get lost. 
 You! You're supposed to be taking care of things, not turning up on my doorstep. 
 It's too late for that. 
 I bought myself some time but it won't be long before Winter figures is out. 
 Well, I can get you to Laos. 
 You can disappear from there, not a problem. 
 Just as long as I don't disappear for good, Penny. 
 Oh, you don't trust me? 
 What do you think? 
 I've left instructions with my solicitors. 
 Anything happens to me, they publish my memoirs. 
 I want the girl gone. 
 What did I just tell you? Listen to me! 
 If she testifies at that committal hearing, it's not going to matter what you've got in your memoirs. 
 Do you know where she is? 
 I've got a fair idea. 
 Indy... you're the only one that can tie Penny Bartok to this operation. 
 And without your evidence... we won't have enough for an arrest. 
 And I get that you're scared, right, I do. 
 But if you do this, Indy... you will be making a huge difference... to all those girls' lives. 
 And what do you think I should do? 
 It's up to you. 
 OK. 
 I'll do it. 
 Good girl. 
 Thank you, Indy. 
 Thank you for that. 
 OK. So now we can link Janet to Karly and Indiana. 
 But if Bjorn killed Janet to cover up the rape, he can't have killed Paul Pagent because he was dying of cancer himself. 
 Ah. 
 Sally, hi. 
 Hi. 
 Ah. 
 You bring him crime photos, I bring him pictures from the kids. 
 Sorry. Force of habit. 
 I think he'd prefer yours. 
 That's not true. Lachlan loves his kids. 
 I know about the girlfriend. 
 For what it's worth, I think that's over. 
 Perhaps. 
 I still don't have what you have. 
 Sally. 
 There is nothing going on between Lachlan and I. 
 Speak the same language, share the same experiences. 
 I'll never be able to compete with that. 
 You don't have to. 
 The truth is we were together a long time ago and it didn't work out. 
 We weren't good together. 
 I dunno. (PHONE RINGS) 
 Maybe we're too alike. 
 Excuse me. 
 Eve Winter. 
 What? 
 Well, why wasn't it distributed? 
 Yeah, alright. 
 Well, just get it over to the police media unit and send me a copy ASAP. 
 Boss. Duca's juvenile record. 
 What do you expect to find? 
 A name. 
 Why wasn't the photo identikit sent to police media? 
 No idea. 
 Oh, sh1t. (PHONE CHIMES) 
 One of Duca's arresting officers is a teenager. 
 Wheeler? 
 Exactly. 
 That's him. 
 Wheeler shot Lachlan? 
 Looks like it. 
 I... 
 He was here before, I think I interrupted him. 
 Just as well you did. Get that officer. 
 We got him. 
 No-one is to enter this room. 
 If Wheeler turns up, arrest him. 
 Arrest him? 
 Or shoot him. Your pick. 
 Need to get back to HQ. 
 ♪♪ MISSING VIDEO ♪♪ 
 I did not abandon my child. 
 I did my very best to do whatever I could to help her but when drugs are involved... 
 I don't take drugs! 
 ..no father wants to see his child suffer. 
 You're a liar. 
 I called this media interview today to explain my situation and to stop further innuendo and gossip. 
 Now please, I'd ask that you respect my privacy... 
 (SCOFFS) .. and leave me and my family alone. 
 Indiana, if you're watching, I forgive you. 
 (SCOFFS) Thank you. 
 He's just making excuses for himself, Indiana. 
 Everyone's going to believe he was a good father. 
 Poor guy just had an uncontrollable druggie as a daughter. 
 I hate him. 
 I'm going to take a bath. 
 Yes, you heard me. I want an alert on Steve Wheeler. 
 Consider him armed and dangerous. 
 Here, you drive. 
 (DOORBELL RINGS) 
 (WATER POURING) 
 Oh, hi. 
 If you're looking for the boss, she's not here at the moment. 
 Yeah, I know. She sent me here. 
 I've figured it out, others will too. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Indiana. Boss wants me to move her. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGS) 
 Just a sec. 
 Hi, boss. 
 Hey, Alesia. 
 I need you to do an immediate check on all of Wheeler's phone records. 
 Wheeler? 
 I'll explain later. 
 He's here. 
 What? 
 He's at the front door. Don't let him in! 
 (SIREN WAILS) Go, go, go! 
 Alesia! 
 You alright? 
 I'm so sorry, boss. 
 Where's Indiana? 
 Bathroom. 
 Indy? 
 Indiana? 
 Indiana? 
 I checked the laneway. No-one. 
 Wheeler must have taken her with him. 
 Why would he? 
 I mean, why not just shoot her? He's working for Bartok. 
 It's the easiest way to stop her testifying. 
 Right. 
 Where is she? 
 She's gone. 
 And where's Wheeler? 
 I don't know. 
 You're going to tell me how you let this happen? 
 It's my fault. 
 I wasn't wearing my gun. 
 I... took off my holster to stretch and then I got distracted and then the doorbell went. 
 Where's your gun now? 
 I don't know. 
 Wait. Back up. 
 What happened before Wheeler got here? 
 Indiana was watching TV. 
 She saw her dad say that stuff about her. 
 She got really angry and then she said she was going to have a bath. 
 Indiana's taken the gun. 
 When I went to the bathroom, the taps were running, the plug wasn't in. 
 She had no intention of having a bath. 
 She was gone before Wheeler got here. 
 I can check the bus depot again. 
 She's not running away. 
 I think I know where she is. 
 I did not abandon my child. 
 I did my very best to do whatever I could to help her but when drugs are involved, no father... 
 You want a top-up? 
 No, I'm good, thanks, darling. 
 I called this media interview today to explain my situation and to stop further innuendo and gossip. 
 Now please, I'd ask that you respect my privacy and leave me alone... 
 Hi, Dad. 
 I saw you on the news. 
 Indiana, if you're watching, I forgive you. 
 You're very convincing! 
 Yeah. 
 You're very convincing. 
 "I did my best." 
 When I told you I was raped... did you do your best then? 
 Put down the gun, Indiana. 
 Why didn't you believe me? 
 Why didn't you believe me? 
 Quick, inside. She's got a gun! 
 No. 
 You're not going anywhere until you've told the truth. 
 Come on, Dad. 
 Tell it like it really happened. 
 My daughter told me she was raped. 
 And I told her to go away! 
 Come on! 
 Indiana. You don't want to do this. 
 You don't care. 
 You just want me to testify at your stupid trial. 
 I care, Indy. Please just put the gun down. 
 He lied about me. 
 To the whole world. I know. I know he did. 
 He said I was a lying, drug addict prostitute. 
 You abandoned me. 
 This isn't going to help anything, Indiana. 
 I just want him to tell the truth. 
 Tell them! 
 The truth is that you were a wild child, I couldn't control you. 
 I thought that a stint away from the city would do you good, then you turn up one night claiming to have been raped. 
 Claiming? 
 He meant saying you were raped, Indy. 
 He was shocked. 
 Your father didn't know how to handle the situation. 
 He wasn't emotionally equipped to deal with it and... he reacted badly. 
 Before he knew it, he was saying all the wrong things, he didn't realise the damage he was doing. 
 Is that right? 
 Yes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (SOBS) 
 I should have listened to you. I was wrong. 
 (SOBS) 
 Put the gun down. 
 So, what happens now? 
 She'll be charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. 
 I expect you will be able to post bail tonight? 
 Bail? 
 She threatened to shoot me. 
 That's attempted murder. 
 After everything you put her through, you really want her charged? 
 She's a danger to herself and others. 
 You sure you want to face the media frenzy that will follow? 
 DPP's daughter charged with attempted murder. 
 I'm not sure they'll be so willing to buy your version of events this time. 
 We don't want her charged. 
 You've done enough damage. 
 Make it go away. 
 You win. 
 Call me when it's done. 
 What did he say? 
 He said he'll post bail. 
 What happened? 
 Indiana was charged, Zeigler posted bail. 
 He came good? 
 Yeah, Father of the Year. 
 I would like to offer my resignation. 
 Won't be necessary. 
 I stuffed up. 
 Yeah, we both did. 
 I should never have left you alone at my place. 
 But Detective... 
 You'll be set on a gun refresher course, I'm not letting you resign. 
 Any news on Wheeler? 
 No, he's gone to ground. 
 OK, could I have everyone's attention, please? 
 As you all know, our number one suspect in the attempted homicide of Detective Sgt Lachlan McKenzie is Steve Wheeler. 
 We believe he's responsible for the death of Bjorn Johansson and the attempted murder of Indiana Hope Zeigler through his association with hit man Eddie Duca. 
 Now deceased. 
 We can establish strong links with Penny Bartok and believe that he's been protecting her illegal prostitution ring and drug racket from the beginning. 
 And Karly Johansson? 
 We still don't know if he had anything to do with Karly's murder. 
 So while it would be very tempting to shoot him on site... we need him in custody for questioning. 
 Now, there's limited places he can go. 
 So I need a search on his house, I need a watch on all his known haunts, credit cards, everything. 
 Any leads, bring them to me immediately. 
 (BREATHES) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Eve Winter. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Tough way to get out of a professional standards interview. 
 They'll probably think I set it up. 
 I can't believe I didn't see it. 
 You weren't alone. 
 God, it's incredible. 
 And to think that Wheeler went to the police academy with my boss. 
 Now, these are packed full of vitamins, so good for you. 
 Thanks, babe. 
 So lucky. 
 Yeah? 
 I was talking to the nurses, second bullet nicked your rib cage. 
 A centimetre to the left, and it would have gone through your heart. 
 Comforting. 
 So, what do you need from me? 
 I'm sorry? 
 I've taken over on the Penny Bartok prosecution. 
 Zeigler had to remove himself for obvious reasons. 
 Do you remember anything that happened before Wheeler shot you? 
 An informant called me about... a pop-up brothel operating out of an old mattress factory. 
 Perfect place to hide. You need to move before he does. 
 The entrance is the black door just round the corner. 
 Is there any activity? 
 A couple of clients coming and going, no sign of Wheeler. 
 OK. Alesia, you stay here, Milo, cover the back. 
 You up for this? 
 Yeah. 
 Alright. 
 (LOUD DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) 
 You got an appointment? 
 We don't need one. 
 You seen this guy? 
 Where is he? 
 Hey! You pay me! Pay me now! 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You better be helping me, Penny. 
 Bartok : (ON PHONE) In Mentmore Street, there is a Gold Commodore. 
 Check the glove box. Alright. 
 Jack? 
 Piss off. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGS) 
 Yeah? 
 You got my gift? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
 Oh good, so take it to the loading dock. 
 Bay 16. And the ship is the Yang Ki. 
 It'll take you all the way to Laos. 
 Any activity? 
 He's got the back. 
 Go back inside, double-check every room. 
 Gold Commodore, driver's seat. 
 Nice doing business with you, Penny. 
 Yeah, send me a postcard.

 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 How you doing? 
 Any news on Wheeler? 
 Well, he wasn't in the car. We know that much. 
 We've got alerts out on him everywhere. He won't get far. 
 I'm going to get him. 
 I want to get him before Penny Bartok does. 
 Hey. You're not going anywhere, my friend. 
 I can't help feeling the last few weeks have been a distraction. 
 Wheeler, brothels, drugs. 
 None of its gotten us any closer to finding out who killed Karly. 
 Thanks to your friend. 
 And yours. 
 Don't do this to me again. 
 Oh. I wasn't planning to. 
 Get some rest. 
 So, I've got Indiana in the safe house. 
 I need to take her to Rocky Point. 
 You know, the committal hearing is in a week. 
 Well, the sooner the better then. 
 I don't think so, not this time, alright? 
 Indiana is close to testifying, I'm not going to have anything jeopardise that. 
 Hey, hang on. 
 That's alright for your case but I've still got an unsolved murder and two little girls who deserves to know what happened to their mother. 
 You always get your own way?
