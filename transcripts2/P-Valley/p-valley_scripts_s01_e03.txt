 CLIFFORD: 
Y'all better sit y'all asses down.   
 It's time for P-Valley.   
 They say if we don't pay up in    days, they gonna have our asses kissing asphalt.   
 Y'all gonna be practicing inside this new building right here.

 [GIRLS SCREAMING, CHEERING]   
 I thought you was gonna get another one of your daughter's contributions today.    
 I'ma need those    stacks I let y'all hold come end of the week.    
 Just talk to your daughter. I think I might just have to try you out on that pulpit one Sunday service.    
 Corbin just text. Say he ain't coming.    
 The brother from another mother strikes again. Ain't this some sh1t?    
 Promised Land can't start until we have the signatory of all owners.    
 But I ain't interested in making a little one-off $  million.    
 I'm interested in making $   million, and if we actually lease our land to the casino, that's what we could make over the long haul.    
 New song, huh?    
 You need to holler at DJ Neva Scared.    
 He get more bump in his bathroom.    
 There's a casino coming to Chucalissa?    
 Ask him yourself.    
 CLIFFORD: "Andre Watkins, Esquire." I don't need to talk to him.    
 Not when I got somebody else it seem he like talking to.    
 AUTUMN: You are not my pimp.    
 Oh, but I am your employer with a fake-ass ID in my hand.    
 Now, unless you don't want me to call the sheriff, let him know about the little fraud game you probably running,    
 I suggest you do as I say.

 I don't want her on the team no more.
