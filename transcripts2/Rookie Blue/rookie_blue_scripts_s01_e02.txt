 Sorry it wasn't wrapped. It was overnight. 
 Take your time, I'm early anyway. 
 I did a really nice job. 
 Looks brand new. 
 Yeah, it is, it is... 
 It's kinda had a really rough first day so, you know, fresh start. 
 Help! Police!

 Yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah, she does that. You sure he's not an undercover cop?

 "Mercury goes retrograde today. 
 Expect communication breakdown, crossed paths. 
 Nothing will go as planned." 
 Are you listening? 
 Listen, I'm just trying to get through my second shift without messing up in a catastrophic way again, all right? 
 We haven't even paraded yet. You already caught a bad guy. 
 We're just ridin' you. 
 You weren't wearing your uniform. 
 It's actually true. 
 If you're not on shift, you don't go after a subject. 
 "Heavy badge syndrome." That's what it's called. 
 Oh, thanks, Chris. Thanks. 
 Well, no, I'm... 
 No, really. No, I'm just saying follow the rules, listen to your T.O., you're golden. 
 See, now that's a horoscope I can actually get behind. 
 Oh, let me guess... capricorn? 
 Power-mad, goat of the zodiac? 
 Hell, no. I'm a Leo. Hit me up. 
 Lion of zion in the house. (Gun fires) 
 (Gasps) Oh! Whoa! 
 Oh, man. You're gonna have so much paperwork. 
 Some of you may remember a guy named Don Reaney Jr. 
 From a triple murder he committed last November. 
 Reaney? No way! Snakeface. 
 (Noelle laughs) Yeah, go ahead and laugh, but it took us months to nail him. 
 He's not as dumb as the tattoo makes him look. 
 (All) Whoa! 
 (Noelle) Look who's back in harness. 
 Thank you, thank you. Feels good. 
 Drank a bottle of Amarone, shaved, took a hot shower... with your mother... 
 (All) Oh! 
 (Laughter) All right, settle down. Pay attention. 
 Reaney here escaped from a prison transport this morning, put one guard in a coma. 
 Where'd we lose him? 
 Yonge and Gerrard, his old stomping grounds. 
 Our very own 15 division. We need to get this guy today. 
 Rookies, this is a real chance to make your bones. 
 Epstein, you're with Shaw. 
 Epstein, nice. 
 Peck, Williams. 
 McNally, your training officer today will be Sam Swarek. 
 (Man chuckles) (Woman) Wow. 
 Now it's, uh, Sammy's first shift back in uniform, so, McNally, be gentle with him this time. 
 Serve, protect and watch your partner's back. 
 Go on. Get out there. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 (Sam) It's an absolute falsehood. 
 What is up with that? 
 No, no, no. He was... half-caf with, uh, skim, two sweeteners. (Panting) 
 Are you kissing my ass? 
 It's... it's just coffee. 
 'Cause, you know, I ain't going easy on you just 'cause your parents are white shirts. Are we clear? 
 Yeah, I'm... I'm a rookie, ma'am. 
 I'm just here to listen and learn, that's all. 
 Ooh! 
 Gentlemen. 
 Ladies. 
 Cheers. 
 Yeah. 
 (Indistinct police radio chatter) 
 Feeling punished? 
 What? 
 Uh, no. No, sir. 
 Good. Tell that hair ball if he pushes you around, he has to answer to me. 
 (Snorts) Right, like I'm gonna be calling homicide. 
 Hey, I could use the company. 
 Anyway, I mean it. You need anything, call me. 
 Sorry about that. Callaghan. 
 (Female dispatcher speaks indistinctly) 
 (Engine starts, siren wailing in distance) Okay, so I'm sure you've had the talk. 
 Partners... you back me up no matter what. 
 Don't move less I tell you to. 
 It's my car, so my rules are the rules. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good, so here's my addendum. 
 I'm here because I'd rather work the streets than man the wire room until a spot in guns and gangs opens up. 
 And while I do like working the streets, I did not ask to train a rookie. I did not ask to have a partner. 
 I'm not your boyfriend. I will not be holding your hand. 
 Well, that's great, 'cause I don't date cops anyway. 
 Sweetheart, you're not my type. 
 Um, I was thinking that maybe we should look for this guy around Gerrard and Jarvis. 
 You know, if I just got out of jail, I'd want some drugs and a hooker... stat. 
 That's good. Or we can follow my lead. 
 That's great. 
 Sound good? 
 Yes, sir. 
 (Gand analog) ♪ yo, no need to freak out ♪ 
♪ unless you're freaked out ♪ 
♪ I bring the passion back in one freestyle ♪ 
♪ this ain't no accident, just a brainchild of another ♪ 
 Dude, we are gonna crack some Snakeface skull. I can feel it. 
 Action followed by more action. 
 Now shouldn't we be, uh, out on the prowl? 
 Hungry like the wolf? 
 We are looking for a weedy guy... he shows up here the same time, just like clockwork, huh? 
 Striped hoodie. Vertical or horizontal? 
 (Woman on radio) There's an open container. 
 You want to keep screwing around? 
 Or do you want to do something? 
 Do something, sir. 
 Huh? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 You notice anything? No? 
 Anything at all? 
 And would like an officer to walk through the house with him. 
 He's right there. 
 That's right. 
 Known associate of don Reaney Jr., okay? A con... 
 (Clicks teeth) A con always checks in with his dealer. 
 All right, get out of the car. 
 What? 
 Bring him over here, and don't en think about touching that gun. 
 He's probably not armed. 
 (Horn honks) 
 (Door closes) 
 (Ho honks) 
 Go get him. 
 Go, Epstein. 
 (Dog barking) 
 (Speaking indistinctly) 
 (Horn honks) 
 Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you a couple... 
 Police! Don't move! 
 I just want to talk! 
 (Tires screech) Whoa! 
 (Gasping) (Horn honks) 
 I said... I said bring him over. 
 (Breathing heavily) I tried. He ran. 
 Get up. 
 Oh, yeah? You shouldn't have let him. 
 Now we gotta book him, Epstein. 
 When you do it right, they don't run. (Handcuffs click) 
 Hey, that was your second rookie mistake. 
 What was the first? 
 Not buying my sandwich. No helmet, huh? Stupid. 
 All right, let's go. Get in. 
 Okay. Man up. 
 (Horn honks) 
 There's a red metal door down that alley on your right... red gang tag. It's open. Go up three flights. 
 Go into a small office on your left and arrest a woman named Emily Starling. 
 By myself? 
 You're 5-0, aren't ya? 
 Uh, what? 
 A cop. 
 Oh, o... okay. What's the charge? 
 Family court warrant... failure to pay child support. 
 Child support? Shouldn't we be looking for Reaney? 
 She knows him, all right? Trust me. 
 What's the matter? You got a little stage fright? 
 No, sir. It's just... 
 Where's the warrant? 
 (Dog barking in distance) 
 Already signed. 
 Go on. 
 (Alarm wailing in distance) 
 (Horn blares in distance) 
 Oh, crap. 
 Come on. 
 Hey, uh.. 
 (Beeps) 
 (Cell phone rings) 
 (Siren wailing in distance, ring) 
 (Bee) What's up, Copper? 
 Hey, Dad, great. Um... 
 I got a question for you. 
 When do I have the authority to enter? 
 Reasonable expectation of a crime, uh, life in danger. 
 Are you actually asking me for help? 
 I know. It's a switch. What about a warrant? 
 Don't you have a training officer to tell you about those things? 
 Yeah, it's just... it's... it's complicated, okay? It's Swarek. 
 Sam Swarek? (Chuckles) I'd just go ahead and kick the door in. 
 He loves that kind of thing. Go ahead. I got your back. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my... 
 Ooh! Okay. 
 (Inhales sharply) Ow. It's really solid. 
 Pick the lock then. You want me to talk you through it? 
 Dad, you taught me how to pick a lock on my 12th birthday. 
 I'm good. 
 Oh. Well, good for me, then. 
 Thanks, Dad. I'll call you later. 
 Go get 'em. 
 (Whispering) Okay. 
 Come on. (Lock clicks) 
 Yes! 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Door creaks) 
 (Indistinct police radio chatter, telephone ringing) 
 Why is my chair so high? 
 You know, I bet someone threw out the instructions to these things. Denise always does that. 
 She comes home with a make-your-own bookshelf or something, then she'll... 
 You still got that girlfriend? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Detective Barber. 
 All right. Reaney's hit the media. 
 There's gonna be tons of tips coming in, most of them are crap. 
 But I want you to keep me posted, okay? 
 Uh, sir, how do we know when they're crap? 
 Good question. Officer Nash, you got a minute? 
 Police. 
 (Door squeaks) 
 Emily Starling? I have a warrant for your arrest. 
 What? But I'm contesting that in court. 
 That was a legal u-turn. 
 Actually, it's family court. 
 Um, failure to pay child support. 
 Lady, I don't even have a kid. 
 Ma'am, would you just stand up, okay? 
 Do you understand the charges against you? 
 Your charges are crap. 
 Excuse me, gentlemen. I have a warrant for this woman's arrest. 
 They don't speak English. (Speaks Chinese dialect) 
 (Speaks Chinese dialect) Look, I actually have a warrant, okay? 
 Okay, um, it's right here. 
 So can you just stand up? Come on. 
 Put your hands behind your back. 
 You gotta be kidding me. This is not happening. 
 Hurry up! 
 Let's get this over with. 
 (Handcuffs click) 
 Move. 
 (Indistinct police radio chatter) 
 Oh, no. No way. Where the hell have you been? 
 I've been trying to reach you! 
 Emily, calm down. 
 Why are you in a uniform, Sammy? 
 My cover got blown. 
 Pedro was with me. He knows I'm a cop. 
 That means everyone knows you're a cop. 
 We don't have a lot of time here, okay? 
 Please take these off! 
 Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. We gotta get you disappeared. 
 Get her in the back, okay? 
 No, no! 
 Whoa, what the hell? 
 It's okay. She's got a point. In the back. 
 Come on. 
 Hey, what's with the fake warrant? 
 It's only fake if they look. 
 Listen, I am trying to play by the rules, okay? 
 I'm trying to play by your rules. 
 That's the thing. I... I don't actually have any rules. But, uh, hey... (Shifts gears) thanks for playing. I missed you last night. I have a life, Jerry, you know. I know the deal... no strings, we hook up... friends with benefits. (Laughs) You are so cute when you try and talk all young. Yeah? Yeah. That's why I love you. You're not one of those girls with crazy rules... you know, make the guy buy you dinner, time your phone calls with a stopwatch. Give me those. Mmm. ♪ Oh, my God. What? Oh, no, that's Boyko with his puzzle. It's a one-way mirror, see? It's cool. Jerry. (Laughs) Jerry! What? I'm not your training officer. Shh, shh, shh. (Lowers voice) You leave first. Go. All right. ♪ Got you a little something. It's no big deal. (Chuckles) It's bad luck to give someone a knife. Not if that somebody's a copper. It's a hosko. Check the blade. (Laughs) You know, now that you're on the job, in case things go south. Is that why I'm in the barn today... 'cause you're worried about me? No. Okay, maybe I, uh, put a little buzz in Boyko's ear. And buzzed what? Nothing. You know, just that you could learn something from the D's. All right, this is not the academy. You are not my instructor anymore, okay? Please don't sabotage me. That inscription is lame. It's a saying. I need to go back to my apartment. No way. First place Anton's people are gonna look. Anton Hill? You have to let me go home. Why? Something there you want? Yeah, my life, my clothes, my books, my collection... Sir, we are not even following orders. Girl's spent $900 on salt and pepper shakers. Buys 'em online. It's insane. Shut up. They're valuable. Yeah? You can steal some new ones at the bus station. Bus station? I thought we had a deal. You promised me 5 grand, said you'd help me move out west. You promised me somethin', too. And I have it. Yeah? Where? No way. It's my insurance. You're telling me I have to leave town, my life's in danger. I don't have a dime, Sammy. This is messed up. Okay, okay. We'll figure somethin' out. So now can I go home and get my stuff? No. Please. No. What are we doing? We're taking care of an informant, dropping her off with one of my guys. Reuben! Hey, bro. Swarek. You ready to work off some debt here I'm not sure he was, like, the guy. But he had this creepy tattoo. Oh. I'll show you. Can I touch your arm, or is that against the rules? Oh, it... it's legal. Huh... It's right... here. Ma'am? Oh. (Slurring) That guy with the tattoo... I have some information. Okay. Let me just grab a pen... Peace and quiet. My roommate's cool. He can be a little... (retches) Ahh! (Coughs) Okay, whoa, whoa. Okay. Yep, I got it. Okay. Maybe not. You know what? You're going to the drunk tank, sir. Chris... Officer Diaz, the gentleman said he had a tip. He puked on our pamphlets. Those are the rules. Come on. Okay, no. All right, come on. Sammy. Reuben, Emily. Hey. Babysit her. Keep her safe. I will. I'll be right back. You still going to meetings? You know it. Good. It works if you work it. Behave. Who, me or her? Both. (Chuckles) Come on. Let's get you some food. Boom! I've been shot. Where are we? (Beep) Front and Cherry, northeast corner. You're right. Probably been playing that since you were 6. Yeah, I'm familiar with it. You know, I always admired your mom making superintendent. It's not easy for a woman to rise in the ranks like that. Total workaholic, huh? Yeah, right. My mom taught me that success is 90% luck, 10% timing. Woman : All units, prepare to copy information about the escapee. Info received from officers is that he purchased crystal methamphetamines this morning. Meth. Use caution. He's probably tweaking. All right, he's paranoid and super strong. Okay, so what do we do? We get the collar before anyone else. Luck and timing, right? (Singsong voice) Luck and timing. (Door unlocks, creaks) Come on in. So this is where you live, huh? (Clears throat) Undercover, yeah... lived. Hey, took me months to put this place together. Must have been tough. (Rip) Yeah, well, you adjust, stop caring about the things you care about. Well, you cared enough about that plant... enough to water it. Yeah, well, you can't just get wasted every night and buy stuff off the TV. You lose yourself that way. "Moby Dick"... on tape? Really? (Chuckles) What, is Anton Hill your white whale? No, it's just the longest book I could find. 
 
 (Cell phone rings) (Ring) (Beep) Reuben, what's up? What? What? Stop. What? Emily's gone. She went home to get her insurance. Get the door, will ya? So what, you always keep your life savings in a mattress? Buy money for the dealers I was working undercover. Won't be missed. Listen, Emily is Anton's accountant, okay? Crazy math brain, gift for laundering money. Anton pulled her off the street, sent her to night school. What do you mean, pulled her off the street? She was hooking for him, starting when she was 12. (Sighs) You know what she wants now? To get her C.P.A. Are you gonna back me up if I give her that money? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay? (Clears throat) Emily? It's us. (Doorknob jiggles) Emily? Stand back. Check it out? Emily? Place is trashed. What happened here? Nothing good. No, sir. The tattoo's on his forehead. Yeah. Your son-in-law is probably not the guy we're looking... Disregard. Any of your tips panning out? Yeah, I smell a commendation. (Telephone ringing) (Chris) Hey, what's wrong with you? This is officer Nash with Metro police, 15 division. Do you think I'm scary? What do you mean? I mean, do I look intimidating? Do I project authority? Is this because you discharged your gun, and you're embarrassed? No, it's not. Oliver doesn't think I can handle myself. Why? You're kind of small. Are you kidding me? I'm just saying, for an officer... Stand up. Okay. I graduated from the same academy you did. You don't think I can handle my own? I... Put your hands up. Come on. Brachial stun. Hit that bundle of nerves behind the ear, you go down. Double ear clap. Pressure makes you drop like a rock. I believe you. It's cool, man. Sit down. Okay. (Scoffs) (Whispers) That was so weird. Hey, Gail. Snob. Peck's okay. No, you're hot and oblivious. Speaking of which, does Denise know that you're a magnet for badge bunnies? I'm not a magnet. Okay, you're in a long-distance relationship with your small town girlfriend. Don't you get tempted to, like, stray? (Clears throat)'M catholic. So what? Me, too. No, I mean I'm a real catholic. I don't just sleep with anybody. Did you just call me a slut? No. No, no, no, no. I meant that, you know, you're fun. You know, you're fun. You're... you're easy. No, no, no, no. Not that kind of easy. Not... Whatever. You think Anton trashed Emily's place? Yeah, they were looking for somethin'. Took Emily instead. So now what? We find out where she is. So back to the alley? We're going in the front this time. (Door bell chimes) Dewey Ling. King of the 2-ounce 8 ball. Where's Emily? (Sniffs) You guys smell anything? I thought you guys couldn't speak English. (Grunts) Uh... (Groans) Aah! Aah! Sir, do you need some help? I'm good. Maybe head up, see if Emily left anything in her office? Okay. How you doing, buddy? You all right? (Singsong voice) Rise and shine. So that's, uh, that's a pretty formal suit to get piss-drunk in. I don't suppose I could ask you to Irish that up for me a little? (Laughs) Sorry. So do you want to tell me why it is that you came into the station? Oh, um, I think I saw that guy you're looking for. I don't want a reward. Um, actually, sir, there is no reward. Um, Helen... my wife... She... she always says, do the right thing. So then, uh, so this guy that you saw, did he have a tattoo? Yeah, a big wiggly snake. Right there. How's a guy gonna get a job with a thing like that, you know? So according to this dealer, Reaney bought a boatload of meth? Yeah, yeah, but the dealer says he's not armed. Anyway, we still don't have a 20. Great. (Knocks on door) Oh, hi. Come in. Um, hi. I... I've... I've got a tip from a guy. He... he says that he saw snake... um, Reaney... go into the Birch Leaf on Queen. When? Hour ago. Now wh... who's your source? Take your time. It's just an escaped killer. He's a reliable informant. I see him around the neighborhood. He just doesn't want Reaney to know that he snitched. Well, birch leaf tavern rents rooms by the week. It could be legit. I guess we should check it out. Thank you. Okay. (Squeaks) I don't even know what I'm looking for. Files, probably. So after a little coercing,  buddy downstairs copped to seeing Emily about half an hour ago. Two of Anton's guys were with her. Did they, um... listen, do you think she's... Dead? No, they walked her out the front door 20 minutes later. She'll be fine. Unless they found what they're looking for. Then she's dead. Okay. All right. I'm Emily. Where would I hide something of value? McNally, we don't have time to play what kind of tree would you be? Let's... let's go. Okay. Ow. Hey, don't tell me where we're going. Honestly, I'm loving the adventure. (Tires screech) We need backup, sir. I mean, if Anton's in his restaurant, then we need to secure the perimeter. We need to send in tac... Not gonna happen. But he'll kill her. I mean, that's what you said. We should have every copper in 15... I never carded her, okay? So the department's not responsible. I did it to keep her safe. The minute you card a confidential informant, type their name in the computer, you might as well put it on the 6:00 news. I never carded a C.I. in my life. It's only a problem 'cause I got burned. You mean because I burned you. Okay, get out of the car. You got a bunch of paperwork to file. Get in there and start filing it. Will you at least tell me where you're going? I'm going to find Emily, okay? What else am I gonna do? I don't got any better ideas. I'm gonna be coloring way outside the lines here, McNally, and I don't get the feeling you're that kind of girl. (Tires peal, car departs) (Sirens wailing) Man : All units, cars 1505 and 1519 are en route to the Birch Leaf Tavern. Don Reaney Jr. is in room 212. 1502, 1521, please attend for assistance. Man : Kill the sirens on your approach. (Noelle) This is Williams. We'll take the back. This is Shaw. We're going to head up through the front doors. (Door squeaks) (Horn honks in distance) (Creak) All right, I'm gonna cover the back stairs. Just stay here, okay? Don't move! Okay. Not a muscle, ma'am. (Men speaking indistinctly) Police! Don't move! Hands in the... On your knees! Do not move! On your knees! Police! Hands in the air! (Siren wailing) Peck! Why didn't you follow him? You told me not to move. Terrific! Noelle! Have you got him down there? That's a negative. Guys, we gotta roll on this. 10 bucks says he's headed toward the campus. Reaney just jumped out the window. He is on street level. (Siren wailing) Man : You guys take 9. We're going 12. Woman : Roger. (Siren continues wailing) Take 3. That's east. Be careful. Stay on your radio. Yes, sir. (Indistinct police radio chatter) This is Epstein. I see Reaney. He's heading east behind the Cameron Library. I need backup. Woman : ... Heading southeast. Police! Stop! (Grunts) Stop! Hey, hey, hey! Calm down. Calm down. It's cool. I know what you're thinking right now. I do. You're thinking you could tear my head off with your bare hands, right? You're thinking, where are the real cops? When are they gonna get here? Guess what, ass box? Aah! I am the real cops! (Laughs) How do you like... I'll take it from here. You look tired. Gail, what are you doing? Wait... I need it more than you do. No, no, you don't. That' my collar. I got here first. Oh, what can I say? 90% luck, 10% timing. (Breathing heavily) Nice work, Peck. Hey, come on, sir. Let's shake a leg. (Inhales) (Beeps) I thought you'd like to know your tip panned out. We don't give out plaques or anything, but thanks. Oh, happy I could help. So you can cruise if you feel sober enough. (Chuckles) I've been sober 20 years, married 33. Fell off the wagon today. Hey, um, I'm glad you caught the guy. You did a good thing, Walter. Your wife... Helen, right? She'll be proud. Yeah, well, she'll never know. I, uh, went to her funeral this morning. (Gun cocks) How'd you know? Know what? We had, like, 80 tips today. How'd you know the old drunk guy who threw up was legit? Better yet, how'd you convince Detective Barber to follow up on it? Well, I didn't exactly tell him who it came from. You lied. I believed the guy, okay? I mean, fine, I bent the rules a little bit. But it paid off. We earned our way into the platoon, thank you very much. You need to lighten up. No, no, no. No, you need to tighten up. Well, that's how we make a good pair, Chris... the slut and Mr. Manual, getting the job done. I did not call you a slut. You know, that guy was married 33 years. She meant everything to him. I mean, imagine that... losing the thing you care about most in the whole world. (Under breath) Something of value. Traci, I need your car. For what? Swarek said to stay put. Ugh. I just need to check something. Please. (Keys jangle) Thank you. (Door opens, creaks) I'd be a willow, Officer Swarek, if I were a tree. Just so you know. (Indistinct police radio chatter) (Cell phone dialing) So what, it's a steelkey USB drive? Yeah. Can it be copied? Yeah, sure, if you work at the Pentagon. Yeah, but I thought that, you know, the Vanier case... you cracked a bunch of passwords. Not with that level of encryption. No way. (Cell phone rings) You gonna answer that? (Ring) No, I'm good. You move heroin through this place, too? (Scoffs) So, uh, where's Emily? (Sighs) Emily. Starling. Your accountant? Adding something up somewhere, I guess. I mean, how would I know? Just give her back to me, Anton. Come on. I got an entire task force dedicated to taking you down. I can have a hundred cops here in a minute. I really doubt that. Try me. No, you got no task force. You screwed up. Now you're on your own. And you're still trying to be the hero. It's Emily, or I take you in. Take me in? For what? You got nothing. If you hurt her, so help me... People get hurt. It happens. But not usually cops. So now maybe you should just, uh, walk away. The perimeter's secure, sir. Officer McNally. I brought the files. Your accounting files. Emily made a copy. Proves you're laundering money. At least we can get you for somethin'. Let's see. Emily first. Or I turn this in. You can go to prison, which, believe me, would make me a happy, happy man. Let me ask you something. How many copies of that did you make? None. (Laughs) What? I'm supposed to believe you? You have my word. Is this it? I said, is that it? Yes. It sure doesn't look like much, does it? If I had this, I'd have my case. Eight months of my life would have meant something. Take her outside. If I find out there's a copy, our little deal's off. And I will find her. You sure you're okay? Yeah, thanks. Were those the real files? Did you get a copy? I... it's encrypted. You can't. What about you? If I did, it's my insurance for when I disappear. You okay, Em? Come here. (Closes door) I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. You broke some rules. You disobeyed my order. You acted like a cop. We were a good team, me and you, even if it all went to hell. I'm gonna miss you. Woman : ♪ 'cause I'm shy and I do not want you to see me ♪ I can take it. I know. I got it.

♪ I'm trying to be polite ♪ So is it normal to be scared when you're making your first arrest? I just felt so alone, you know? That beeyotch totally stole my arrest. I mean, I took Snakeface down single-handedly. She swoops in there at the last minute... Single-handedly? Yes. Man, let it go. There'll be more. Says the babe magnet. Have you noticed that women are more attracted to you now that you're a cop? Uh, yes. You're just now noticing this? You remember what we were talking about before... the who slut thing? I meant that you were more of a-a free spirit. Well, you know what? Hey, hey. Well, great. Way to go. (Clink) Babe magnet. (Laughs) All right. Thanks for the wheels. I gassed it up. Nice! I guess the stars do lie. Well... no. 'Cause they got my day totally right. (Indistinct conversations) Officer Nash. You still got that knife? I don't know. Maybe somewhere. I'm cutting the no-strings, Jerry. (Case lock clicks open) Okay. I... I don't even know what that means. It means thank you... Mm-hmm. For the gift. And, uh, I would be delighted to have dinner with you. Dinner? New rules... take 'Em or leave 'Em. Okay. ♪ There's music in the background ♪ (Door creaks) ♪ The rain falls on the roof ♪ (keys jangle) Sir? Hey. Hey. Hey, um, listen. How do you know Anton Hill is not gonna follow Emily out west? Huh? Well, we put her on a bus to Kelowna. How do you know he's not gonna go there and kill her? Well, she didn't go to Kelowna. Oh. It's not that I don't trust you. It just seems like, uh, the fewer people who know... Right. Yeah, yeah. You really gave up the whole case for her, huh? Yeah, well... who knows what I gave up? Maybe nothing. Emily's smart that way. Were you scared in there? Yeah. You? ♪ No. I mean, you were there. ♪ (sighs) Let me take you home. (Laughs) McNally... ♪ Oh, I can't, I can't. I can't do this. I'm sorry.
