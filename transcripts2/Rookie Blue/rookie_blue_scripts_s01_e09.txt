 (Man) ♪ Thought you heard the moon ♪ 
♪ laughing right at you Hey. 
 All right. 
 How's this? 
 It's fine if you go like this. 
 Oh, come on. 
 We should have borrowed a level. 
 No. And I'm telling you, I've got a good eye, okay? 
 It's like a superpower for me. I can hang things straight all day. 
 (Chuckles) Yeah, maybe two drinks ago. 
 But I am impressed. You've lived here five months... 
 Four. 
 Whatever. But tonight you finally made a decision, and you nailed it down. You're living with it happily, kinda like with Homicide Luke. 
 Mm. 
 Took you a while to settle in there... a couple of nights of dinin' and dashin', a little should I? Shouldn't I?" 
 But now you're living with it happily. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I hooked up with Sam. 
 What? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Um, I mean, I didn't sleep with him. 
 I totally would have. 
 When? 
 The night of the blackout. 
 Why didn't you? 
 Because... the lights came on. 
 I shouldn't tell Luke? 
 You went to the guy's cabin for sexy time. 
 You are not telling him now. 
 God, they used to call me a slut. 
 And I'm assuming that this thing that happened with Swarek, your training officer, was a mistake, Yeah, best mistake of my life. (Chuckles) Yes, Traci, it was a mistake. Things with Sam are complicated, and... with Luke, they're just... they're simple. I mean, he cares about me, I care about him,  and I do want to make it work. Okay, then write his name down. Who? Sam Swarek. Okay. And drop it in the jar. Now just put it in, 'cause, honey, you gotta suck it up. Put Sam Swarek on ice. Forget the blackout ever happened. Go ahead. Put him in the freezer. That simple, huh? Well, you want to make it work with Luke, you gotta step it up. If I were you, now is the time I would become girlfriend of the year. Girlfriend of the year? Fake it till you make it. (Sighs) What is a man? A miserable pile of secrets. Good news for us... secrets are meant to be broken. I think you mean promises. Same thing. Mr. Acoustic on Yonge Street, promised he'd been robbed, promised he'd conveniently received a massive shipment of electronics right before said robbery, but promised he could not find the paperwork. I promised him we'd look into it. You think he faked the robbery? I do. And you want us to put that together? Come on. It'll be fun, kinda like doing a... a big Jigsaw puzzle up at a, I don't know, a fishing cabin. Speed trap. Trap of the speed. Wow. It's gonna be gripping. Oh, did... did you wanna switch, Gail? (Laughs) No. Can't. Assignments have already been called. Oh, please, God, give me a high-speed pursuit. I haven't driven over 50 on this job. It's getting embarrassing. Epstein, you ready to roll? Rolling, sir. Peck, Diaz, you're working together. Same car, nothing fancy. You're gonna run the beam. Epstein and I are gonna reel them in and hand out the zingers. You and me, huh? So? I'm just saying. Just remember to point it directly at the car you're targeting, all right? Yeah, I know how to use it. Okay, I was just... just trying to be helpful. Yeah, you've been really helpful lately. (Hip-hop playing loudly) This guy. Officer Shaw, we got a yellow 2-door coming at you, right Lane, doing 74. Okay, I get it. (Siren wailing in distance) Get what? What this is about... reporting your brother's partner to internal affairs. I get that you're angry about that. Chris... But you know what, Gail? I've thought about it a lot, and here's where I'm at... one, I didn't report your brother. I reported his partner. Okay? And two, that's the kind of cop I wanna be, you know? I wanna do the right thing. And... and three, I thought you'd respect that. Okay, and I... I think we can move past this, together. That's what I think. So you figured that all out by yourself? Okay. All right. (Hip-hop playing loudly) (Man) Look, I know I was going a little over...  Yeah, turn that down. Turn that down. (Volume decreases) But see, the thing is, is I got a big, big job interview, right, so I don't want... I don't want to be late for that. Yeah, what time's the job interview? 12... 12:50 is what they told me, but, I mean, if I go now,  I could probably just... just nail it. Yeah, and what kind of job? Project manager... for s... for projects. You always go to job interviews with your hockey shirt on? Yeah. Yeah, good luck with that. You drive safe now. (Man) Thank you. "Oh, Officer, please. "My speedometer's busted. My wife's in labor. I got the runs. Blah, blah, blah." You ever let 'em off? Yeah, once. There was this guy who was late for his tenth wedding anniversary. He was sweating bullets and, uh, even had the... the diamond earrings sitting there in the... in the seat next to him... cutest little blue box. I wouldn't have pegged you as a romantic. Yeah, you kidding? Hearts and flowers, Epstein, all the way. Whatever my girl wants... babies, a new roof, more babies... (Sighs) secret to a happy life, my friend. Secret to a happy life. You know what, Gail? If there's something you want me to say, then let me know, okay? 'Cause I'm tired of guessin'. It's as simple as... Okay. Did it ever occur to you, Mr. "I've got it all figured out," that this isn't just about you? Uh, sir, we got a red truck and a gray 2-door that swept by at warp nine. All right, we're on it. Did you get a plate? Uh, no, sir, they were moving way too fast. Car's tango-6-whiskey-4-delta-4. (Oliver) Nice work, bright eyes. All right, let's go. (Horn honks in distance) (Sighs) (Tires screech) You trying to make me look like an idiot? I'm not trying to do anything, sweetie. I can see that, loud and clear. (Tires screech, crash) (Siren wailing) (Siren stops wailing) (Chris) What happened? I don't know. We were right about to chase 'em, then all of a sudden, the screeching tires, then this. Don't move her. I'm gonna call an ambulance right now. You go and you check that truck. (Oliver) Dispatch, 1505. No, there's no one here! Check the floor. Check the ground. They might have been thrown. 1505. I need an ambulance at Garrison and Lake Shore right away. (Woman) Copy, 1505. Sir, there's no one in it! There's gotta be! We were right behind him! No, there isn't! (Siren wailing in distance) (Andy) This is ridiculous. (Traci) Don't even. Coffee. Thank you. Do you like artichokes? Not in my coffee. Well, I mean, there'd obviously be hollandaise sauce for dipping and steak and cream cheese mashed potatoes. Where? My house. You're the salad-in-a-bag lady. Not always. Pretty well always. Well, not tonight. Look, you don't know everything about me. (Chuckles) Okay. Okay, are you in? Hollandaise? Hell, yeah. Nice. Pfft! Girlfriend of the year. (Laughs) (Sirens wailing) (Horn honks in distance) (Chris) We didn't find anything. Hey, any luck with the plates? Oliver's running 'em now. Sir, did you find anything on the truck? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Truck's plates just went out on the system as part of a citywide Amber alert. Apparently, 8:30 this morning, security cameras recorded a 9-year-old girl getting into this truck. She has not been seen since. Guys, this isn't just an accident. This is a child abduction. Her name is Rebecca Leigh... 9 years old, on her way to school, caught on camera getting into this truck on the corner of Parliament and Winchester, 8:33 a.m. Now the truck is registered to Connor Chapman, 38. Priors? Oh, yeah, he's on the list... two counts sexual assault on a minor, one with a weapon. This is the real deal. Now noelle is handing out info packages containing known associates, last known address, everything we've got so far. Okay, guys, we are going to assume that she's still alive. Otherwise, he probably would have left her at the accident site. But let me remind you... every minute that this girl is missing increases the chance we're gonna find her... Right. You guys know the deal. Noelle, let's... let's get this done. Detective Barber will be running this from the D's office. We're getting investigative help from H.Q., more uniforms from 18 and 36, including K9. In the meantime, we'll be searching the immediate area. Stay alert. Stay on your radios. Serve, protect, and let's find this girl now. (Oliver) Yeah. You got that? I'm gonna send Peck and Diaz west from the L.K.P. All right, let's go. Let's go. I am gonna be in my car. I'll be spinning the area. You two are gonna search on foot. You're gonna stay on-scene. Uh, sir, I'd rather search, if that's okay. No, not up for discussion. You gotta wait here until ident is finished, then go over to memorial and get a statement from that woman. All right, Epstein, you gotta figure out if she's connected to this, okay? Okay, off you go. May we catch this creep. Yes, sir. (Oliver) Get goin'! (Helicopter whirring overhead) (Truck horn blares) I'm going north, away from the lake. Yeah. I've got a little girl with me, so, you know, I'm obviously hiding, trying to get my bearings. Hey, what was the description on the girl's clothes again? It's a plaid... pea-coat and a pink bag. (Train wheels clacking) (Gail) Hey! Where'd you get that bag? Oh, yeah, go right ahead. Homeless guy doesn't need a backpack. What's he gonna put in it anyway, right? Want anything else? My shoes... you like those? Hey. I'm gonna ask you again. Where'd you get the bag? Right over there. I don't know, like, ten minutes ago, just lying there. Yeah, you sure about that? Yeah, I'm living the life. Why would I lie? You know what? So sue me. I don't trust anybody with aftershave on his breath. Oh, yeah? Who do you trust, Gail? (Gail sighs) (Panting) I'm looking through it now. Yeah. Did you get anything? Well, what about the traffic cameras? I need everything that we can get on this. Jerry, Ben Leigh's here. Noelle's bringing him in the front door. Rebecca's Dad? No, I don't care if you stick wings up your ass and you fly. You get that footage here right now. (Slams down receiver) Okay, where's the mother? We need to be the first to tell the parents about Chapman, not the news. I thought she'd be with the Dad. No, they're divorced. They're barely speaking. Wait a minute. We don't have the mother? No. Okay, call her. Tell her we're gonna pick her up. But, Traci, nothing about Chapman until she gets here. Yes. Okay. Bye. Hey, that was Peck and Diaz. Looks like they might have found some of Rebecca's clothes. Ident's already heading over. So Chapman's ditching anything that identifies her, screws up our description. That's just what we need. Okay, Sammy, we got the Dad coming in. I want you to handle it. Just until I can strateg... (Noelle) Detective Barber. Mr. Leigh, Detective Jerry Barber. Uh, Ben's fine. It's nice to meet you. Listen, uh... Look, we're... we're... we're on it. Okay? Okay, we are all on it... all these people. We're doing everything that we can. Thank you. Now we're gonna be sending over a couple of officers to pick up your wife... your... your ex-wife right now. Officer Williams, if you would take Officer Nash. Uh, uh, well, someone will stay there, right, in case Rebecca shows up? Yeah, we're on it. (Noelle) Nash. Okay, Sammy. Uh, Mr. Leigh, I'm Officer Swarek. Excuse me. Let's get you settled somewhere a little more private. This is Officer McNally. She'll be joining us today. Nice to meet you. Anything you need? Coffee? Water? Um... Who is that? (Clears throat) Is he the one who took her? Uh, we can talk about that in here, Mr. Leigh. Um, just please come this way, sir. (Doorbell rings) Figures we're the ones sent to babysit the house. Crappy details like this, guys always send the women. Jerry's not like that. (Dialing cell phone) Yeah, well, you'd know. (Door creaks) Kathryn Leigh? Uh, yeah. Sorry. I was just... Wait. What's happening? Did you... Have you... Can we come in, ma'am? I'm sorry. Please come in. I'm Officer Williams. This is Officer Nash. Hi. Please tell me that you found her. Please. Uh, there's no sign of Rebecca yet, ma'am, but we're here to make sure you get down to the station right away. They can fill you in better from there. No. I mean, what if Rebecca comes home, and I'm not here? I mean, I need to clean up. Don't want the place to be a mess when she comes home. Well, Officer Williams and I will be right here, and, uh, and we'll keep you posted. There's someone waiting out front to take you right now. Well, I can go like this. Mrs. Leigh, you look fine. (Keys jangle) (Door squeaks) (Children shouting indistinctly, dog barking in distance) (Traci) Wow. She don't even really seem that upset. (Car door closes) Don't judge her. Do not judge her. Ten years on this job, one thing I learned... grief looks different on everybody. Excuse me. Can I help you? Officer dov Epstein. This woman may be involved in a child abduction. Edith, huh? She okay? (Nurse) Mild concussion. Don't know how long she'll be asleep. I just need a statement. I'll wait. Looks like you got the fun job, huh? We're running down every known address of Chapman's, anyone who might have talked to him since he got out of prison. But you're sure it's him? That's what we're assuming for now. Is he gonna hurt her? I can't imagine how hard this must be for you, but if there's anything you can tell us, anything at all, especially about this morning, that might help. Uh, we share custody. I get Rebecca every other week. I didn't see her. So Rebecca was with you this morning, Mrs. Leigh? Yes. Uh, uh, we got up. I... got her dressed. I made her breakfast. Okay. Can you tell us what she was wearing? Well, yeah. I mean, you saw it on the tape, right? She had on her plaid coat. I'm sorry. I mean, underneath the coat, Mrs. Leigh. Well, her jacket was discarded, so it'd be helpful to know what she was wearing underneath. Excuse me. Are... are you saying she doesn't have her jacket? I mean, it's freezing out there. I don't remember. I mean, she's very independent. She dresses herself. She walks herself to school. Rebecca walks to school by herself? Well, yeah, sometimes. I... We have a difference of opinion on a lot of things. That's one of the reasons why... well, Ben walks Rebecca to school... every morning, but Rebecca hates it, because she wants to be a big girl. And so a few weeks ago, I figured the school was only a few blocks from our house. I mean, I walked myself to school when I was her age, so... Me, too. A lot of parents let their kids walk to school alone. Well, lots don't. We've told her... a million times... you... you... You don't talk to strangers. You don't get into cars. Maybe it wasn't a stranger. Like you said, we've seen the tape. Rebecca didn't look coerced. Any other adults in her life, people she might take a ride from? Ma'am? I'm gonna ask you that again. Okay? Are you both telling me you have no friends, no relatives, nobody new in your lives Rebecca might take a ride from? (Jerry) Excuse me, folks. Sam, you got a minute? (Sam) Could you give us a minute please, folks? (Jerry) McNally. (Indistinct conversations, telephone ringing) What's the idea in there? What are you doing? Jerry. Jerry. A huge majority of child abductions are committed by someone who knows the child. Okay, what's the idea here? He thinks they're lying. About what? We've got video of the kid getting into this guy's truck. It's not the parents, Sammy. All right, that doesn't mean they're not involved. The Bevilacqua case.. That's totally a different situation. Come here. There's something here, Jerry, okay? She doesn't remember what her kid was wearing? Really? So? She's not a cop. I mean, she's not gonna remember every little detail. I don't care who you are. You try to remember something. You struggle. You think about it. "Brown pants" or her favorite shirt's got a heart on it." That woman's got nothing. How come she remembers nothing? Okay. Luke, you got a minute? Sammy needs some advice. Thanks. (Hangs up receiver) All right, you know what? Don't... I... I got everybody and their cousin looking at this thing. Okay? And I don't want civil suit on my hands. These people might actually be telling the truth. Okay. All I'm asking is that you talk to Callaghan, you bring him up to speed on the case, before you go in with your guns blazing. Please. (Sighs) What's the Bevilacqua case? First big one I worked as a rookie... a reported child abduction, parents were devastated, beside themselves. I believed them. We found their son, a 4-year-old boy, in Dad's hockey bag in the basement. Jeez. You wanna get to the truth? Sometimes you gotta get rough, get your hands dirty. Secrets don't come out all neat and tidy, Andy. I'm kinda surprised you haven't figured that out by now. (Door squeaks) (Exhales deeply) You gonna keep 'em together? Yeah, I thought I might. They're already starting to turn on each other. Apparently, it was an ugly split, so... I don't know. I'd separate 'em. Stay sympathetic, general questions. Just watch their body language. Oh, body language. Huh, that's good. Did you get a baseline of how they act when they're not threatened? Too late for that. It's too bad. (Sighs) Keep the questions to this morning. If the story changes, give me a call. Good luck. (Door opens) (Door closes) 
 
 Right now... we're partners, okay? And I'm still your training officer, so you don't roll your eyes at me, you don't question my methods. Yes, sir. You got a problem with that? How do you want to do this? I'm gonna talk to the Dad, and you're gonna take her into the squad room and wait for me there. Sir? Excuse me, sir? You won't even look at the girl's picture? I told you so many times already, okay? Look, there is an Amber alert right now. Please. Hey. Is everything all right? I haven't seen him! If I haven't seen him, how could I see her? That's not what I asked you. I have to work. I'm sorry, but I have to. Can I? Please? I'm sorry. He gave the same answer as everyone else, and I didn't smell any aftershave. Yeah, but what the hell is he so sorry about? (Telephone ringing) My mind is just racing, you know? Have a seat. All the things I should have said to her this morning... "You're my beautiful girl. I love you so much." Just... why didn't I walk her to school? I should have just walked her to school. It's not your fault. Yes, it is. That's the thing. I wish I could just turn it back, rewind, start over, do everything right this time, clean, fresh, you know, mother of the year. Are we allowed to sit down? I don't want to disturb any evidence. They've already searched the house, Nash. This ain't "C.S.I.," all right? Right now, the parents aren't suspects, so if you want to sit down, sit down. We're gonna be here a while. Oh, man, she is a cute kid. Yeah, well, they always are. I said you could take a seat. I didn't say you could snoop through their stuff. But what if it's relevant? What if there's... Right now we're here to watch this woman's house in case the kid shows up. All right, we're not here to build a... Ow! You all right? What's wrong? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just... I just... I just have a headache, all right? That's all. Driver's license number 3-0-8-4-9-2. Yes, that's it. Edith Larson... possession? What for? Weed? Whatever. Anything else? Excuse me? Uh, Edith Larson. "Edie," please. I hate "Edith." What am I doing here? You were in an accident on Lake Shore. Do you remember? What... am I okay? I'm okay, right? You're fine. Do you know a man named Connor Chapman? Connor Chapman or Rebecca Leigh? I need you to focus, Edith. (Scoffs) I'm sorry. I just woke up in a hospital bed. Can you give me a second? We don't have a second. There's a little girl missing, and I think you know something about it. Yeah, I know about it. I was chasing them. Chasing them? Yeah. I saw the license plate on one of those... those... (Sighs) electronic billboards that they have over the highway. This truck starts passing me... same plate number. I couldn't believe it. I was trying to dial 911. I was trying to keep up. You were chasing that truck? Is that weird? No. No, I mean, it's, uh, a little kamikaze, but I like your style. The driver... the guy... the man who was driving the truck... what was he wearing? It's important. We need a description. It wasn't a guy. What are you talking about? The driver... the person in the truck... the person I was chasing... it was a woman. (Jerry) Tell me again. According to my witness, the driver was a woman, Caucasian, mid-30s, light brown hair. Long hair. Down here. Long hair, apparently. Sounds like Rebecca's mom. Epstein, you sure your witness is reliable? The girl's got a concussion. She seems very reliable, sir. Okay, uh, good work. Get a formal statement. Stay with her in case we need an I.D. Okay, we gotta let the officers on the ground know we are now looking for a woman, and we gotta look into Chapman's known associates. We have a woman who matches that description right here, Jerry, who supposedly can't remember what her own kid was wearing this morning and who was out of our sight when that accident happened. That's who we need to take a run at. What do you think? (Luke) Sounds absolutely right. All right, let's do it. Let's do it. If it's a migraine, you need to take something. Nash, I'm fine, all right? I... I've had these before. Okay, well, look, there's a pharmacy down the block. If you tell me what you need, I can get in the car... I can't take anything for it. Why not? (Whispers) Because... (Normal voice) I'm waiting to see if I'm pregnant, all right? And I can't take anything until I know for sure. Acetaminophen. You can take acetaminophen. I took it when I was pregnant. And I bet you anything, there's some lying around here. I'm gonna find out for you. When do you find out? I mean, it's kind of exciting. You could be... Or not. It's been two weeks. Two weeks? You should take a test. I... I guess I just... What if I'm not? What if you are? She's got a pregnancy test. You wanna pee on a stick? Nash! All right, all right. I'm just checking. Here. (Pills rattle) Um, oxycodone? This is weird. Why? 'Cause it's not her name on the bottle. (Pills rattle) Megan Renforth? That's the downstairs tenant. They searched her place this morning. At least they should've. (Beep) Oh, yeah, they did. Tenant wasn't at home, but mom let them in. Keys hidden around the meter. (Traci) So you want us to go in? Uh, yeah. We can swing it without a warrant. Go in. Check it out. Take a good hard look. Okay? Call me back. (Knock on door) Megan Renforth, it's the police! We're coming in! Megan Renforth? It's the police. Oh, my God. What... what are we looking for? Uh, kiddie p0rn, keys to a red truck, drugs... anything that ties Megan to the mom or the kid. Oxycodone's pretty serious stuff, huh? Hillbilly heroin, right? Easy there, rook. We didn't just bust the French connection. No way. I used to have one of these. You know what? There should be a rule... no pink electronics. It gives women a bad name. Oh, my God. (Sets case down) Noelle? What? This is him, isn't it? It's the guy we're looking for. That's Connor Chapman. Yeah, that's the guy. "'Yes, you can!' Releasing the inner winner: The ways to be successful in life." Every year I reread it cover to cover. You? Uh, no, not since college. I needed all the mental motivation I could get back then. Oh. A guy like me... not exactly the beefiest guy in the room. Really? You look fine in this room. Oh, thank you. I, uh, thanks. (Beep) Uh, here it is. This is the, uh, woman. That's her. You sure? Yeah, that's definitely her. Outstanding. (Beeping) So they just send you the picture and then you call it in, and then everyone's all chasing around for her? Cool job or what? Yes, it is. (Exhales deeply) Okay, Epstein, great work. Sammy, get a copy of this photograph to everyone. We are now looking for Megan Renforth, 34, no priors. We know she's connected to Chapman, and her pills connect us to Kathryn Leigh. Kathryn Leigh. Now we just need to know how it all fits together, ah? Talk to Callaghan. Get him to get it out of the mother. You mean McNally. She's the one doing the interview. Woman : Megan Renforth is now the prime suspect. Check NBT for furthers. Female, white, mid-30s. Got it. All right, we need to go back. We have to find that cabbie... you know, the one that was all, "I'm sorry." Why? He said he didn't see the girl. No, he said he didn't see the guy. He wouldn't even look at Rebecca's photo. Gail, not everyone's hiding something. I don't... (Static) Dispatch, I need you to track down a cabbie. It's a Sunstar Company, Omar Shaheed. Copy. (Static) Okay. She's inexperienced, Luke. She's a rookie. She's non threatening. She can listen. Look, she's perfect for this because she's a rookie. Okay. Are you ready for this? Absolutely. Yeah? Okay, fine. Fine. If it were me, I'd go at her with the drugs, the neighbor, the boyfriend, everything. She's lying about somethin'. You know it. Let her know it. (Luke) There's no right or wrong way to do this. Remember, nothing makes a person feel worse than having something they need to tell. Let her tell it. All right. (Door beeps) (Door squeaks) What do you mean, it was Megan? She's my downstairs tenant. She was the one driving the truck right before the accident. Look, we believe she's involved with Chapman. I mean, that's... that's what we know. Megan took Rebecca, and she has a relationship with a pedophile who owns that truck. Kathryn, we also know about the oxycodone that's in your house. What we don't know... what I don't know is, um...   what it all means. I... I have no idea what it's been like for you... you know, the divorce and being alone, raising a little girl. I-I couldn't even begin to guess how hard it's been. I really want to find Rebecca. Is there anything you can do to help me? I really want to tell you. (Lowers voice) But I don't know. What do you mean? I don't know. It's been... you gotta understand it's been a really rough year. Since Ben and I split, I j... I haven't been doing very well, and I... I mean, I've been... I've been a bit of a mess, and I haven't been sleeping, and Megan... you know she's a friend, right? So she's... she had a key to my apartment, so she was helping me out with Rebecca, and... I mean, she knew that I wasn't sleeping, so she gave me those pills. And then yesterday it was just a really long day, and... I guess I took more than what I usually do. Rebecca...  Rebecca asked me to read her a bedtime story, but I couldn't because... I was zoned out in front of the TV. (Sniffles) So I guess... she put herself to bed. And she must have got up, and made herself breakfast... and got herself dressed... and walked to school by herself... (Crying) and the next thing I knew, the phone was ringing, and it was 9:30, and I was still zoned out in front of the TV. And... it was the school, and they said that she hadn't made it and that she was gone. Why wouldn't you tell us this before? (Sniffles) Because I wanted you to look for her the same as you would if I was a good mother and not if I was just a mess. Where would Megan go? Where would she take her? I don't know. I mean... (Sniffles) God... she talked about some family farm in Port Hope, but I don't know. I mean, I just... okay, no, let's just... we can start with that. (Door squeaks open) Sir, we don't have time for this, okay? Please just look at the picture. I can't. You're right. Let's take him in. No, wait. Wait. Why can't you? Look at her! She's a little kid. She's scared. She needs help. What if you had a daughter? I do have a daughter. Well, then I'm pretty sure you'd want someone to help her if she was lost. I would, but I can't. What do you mean you can't? What are you talking about? I'm not supposed to be here. You're not supposed to be here. You mean in this country? Please just tell us anything you know about her. Anything else, it's just between us. Have you seen her? Yes. What about her? They were going to the bus station. Front and York. Front and York. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm so sorry. (Siren wailing) Sir, we're almost at the bus station, I just checked with dispatch. The Port Hope bus left 15 minutes ago. They're gonna enter the freeway at the York street tunnel, and we're gonna cut 'em off there. We're on it. (Sirens whooping) (Sirens stop whooping) (Helicopter whirring overhead) (Siren wailing in distance) (Door squeaks) Everybody, just stay in your seats. Connor Chapman? Rebecca, it's good to see you. (Nervously) Hi. Her mother is a total drug addict. We were just trying to help... take her to the farm for a bit, you know? Do something nice. By kidnapping her and taking her away with a convicted s*x offender? No, no, no. You don't understand. That was a mistake. It was all lies. He doesn't have to hide who he is with me. Keep your eyes forward. I get him, okay? I let him be who he is, and he said he wasn't gonna hurt her. He promised. Okay, ma'am. Connor, tell them your promise! It's okay. (Sirens whooping in distance) (Oliver) That's my car right over there. Okay. I'm gonna close the door, okay, Rebecca? But I'm gonna come right back, all right? (Sighs deeply) Woman : Sir, please step this way. (Indistinct conversations) Sir? Sir? It's good. We're good. (Sniffles) We're good. (Sirens wailing in distance) Tough day. Yeah. Want to get a drink? No, I gotta get home. Zoe had the girls all day. I kind of want to, uh, I want to say good night to everybody. All right. Good work out there, huh? Yeah. You, too, brother. (Knocks on door) I come bearing gifts. (Chuckles) Oh, thank you. There you go. Okay. Uh, you know, not that it's any of my business, but the, uh, the weed and the asthma, it's kind of a tricky combination. I mean, not that I would know or anything. You checked my record. Busted. What do you know about asthma, anyway? (Laughs) (Chuckles) Well... between the book, the asthma and the high-speed pursuit, it's like you're me but a hot chick. Whoa. That was incredibly inappropriate. I'm sorry. So they found the little girl? She's fine? She's good? Yeah, safe and sound thanks to you... I mean, at least partly. That was very heroic. I wouldn't be surprised if they gave you, like... a citation or something. So, uh, I was thinking maybe I should just hang out here for a little while with you, you know, to make sure you're okay, you don't need anything. My hero. It's going around. (Laughs) (Door creaks open, closes) Noelle? You okay? (Door squeaks) How long are you supposed to wait? I don't know. Nothing's happening. We can wait a little longer. Yeah. We can do that. Today was amazing, hey? (Ice cubes clink) Yeah. Yeah, it was. You were great. (Chuckles) Thanks to you. When did you hang these? Oh, last night. (Sighs) It took a little Pinot Noir, but I finally took the plunge. What's going on with you and Swarek? What do you mean? (Ice cubes rattle) Secrets, Andy. They don't work. They never do. Yep. I don't want secrets. Then tell me the truth. I can't help you unless you tell me the truth. Don't do that. I'm not a suspect, Luke. Okay, and I'm not blind. (Sighs) It was one night. It was one... I didn't even sleep with him, okay? I... Then what did you do? Nothing. I'm gonna go. No. No. Luke... Please don't. Okay? Don't go. Will you stop, please? One night? I don't... I don't know what that means. I don't know what you're saying, but I do know it is not nothing. It's not, Andy. Luke, really, I... come on.
