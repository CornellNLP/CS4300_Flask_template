 You're sure it was him? 
 I don't know. 
 What the hell is he doing here? 
 I don't... 
 Car's just over there. We can do this. 
 Yeah, but what about that open spot? We might be in range. 
 We don't have much of a choice. 
 Come on. Okay. 
 Wait. 
 6:00. 
 Down, get down! 
 Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Okay. Tell me we made it. 
 We made it. 
 All right, kiss me! 
 No, no. No, you look really cute. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! What?! 
 I freakin' knew you guys were together! 
 I should write you up. 
 I'd be doing you a favor. 
 You are gross! You need help! 
 You're lucky my camera phone's broken. 
 Dov! I know where you live! I can't bel... 
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 It's all about saving the pennies, brother. 
 Gotta save the pennies. 
 You shouldn't have. 
 I didn't. 
 Who's the lucky girl? 
 Jerry. 
 I don't know. 
 Bounce in your step, twinkle in your eye... 
 I didn't know any better, I'd swear you were in love. 
 Hey, Swarek. 
 We need to talk. 
 Is this about McNally? 
 Yeah. 
 I need your help. 
 Today's her first shift back on since the shooting, and I'm just worried it's gonna be a little weird for her. 
 Okay, so? 
 So, uh, I am taking her for the night, give her a chance to unwind, clear her head. 
 But it is an hour and a half drive after shift. 
 Do me a favor and make sure she gets out of here, Doesn't get caught up in anything. 
 McNally's going up to your fishing cabin? 
 Yeah. It's her idea. 
 Oh. Oh, she just didn't strike me as the fishing type. 
 Sammy, a fishing cabin... 
 Right, right. 
 Yeah, sure, okay. 
 Uh, yeah, no problem. I won't get in your way. 
 Thanks. 
 All right. 
 You followed us last night. That was creepy. 
 No, it wasn't creepy, it was stealthy. 
 What was creepy was you knocking boots. 
 Hey, my fiancée and I we just broke up. 
 We want to keep it discreet, okay? 
 Denise wasn't your fiancée. 
 Hey. 
 Relax, okay? It's in the vault. 
 Yeah, I've heard that one before. 
 Excuse me, you can afford $200? Why wouldn't I bet on you? 
 Yeah. So... 
 All right. Fine. Fine, $200... 
 Oh, you gotta put your money down first, right, because... 
 What, you don't trust me? 
 What's wrong with you? It looks like you've been run over. 
 Yeah, by fun. 
 He was at the penny. 
 So you're hungover? 
 And we're doing community outreach. Good times. 
 Livin' the dream. 
 Coppers of 15. 
 Oh, look at that shirt! 
 Nice. 
 All right. Thank you, thank you. 
 Uh, before we start, I have a couple of messages to share. 
 First, former staff sergeant Boyko says hi from headquarters. 
 He wants to make sure you're all listening to me, giving me the respect that I deserve. 
 Second, from our wounded Officer Oliver Shaw. 
 It says, "Thank you for your wonderful cards and flowers, but please get serious... send food." 
 Okay, down to business. 
 Today is our off-duty retraining for all senior officers. 
 And, as you know, retraining is my baby, so like every year, it's not gonna be pretty. 
 Rookies, you'll be, uh, spending your paid off-duty at the local high schools doing community outreach. 
 Sweet. 
 Except for Officer Peck, Officer Peck, please join me. 
 She is so far up his balloon knot. 
 Rookies, pick up your assignments on the way out. 
 The rest of you, get ready to serve, protect and have your asses thoroughly kicked. 
 I don't think so. 
 Thanks. Thanks, boss. 
 Thank you so much. This is so awesome. 
 Sam. 
 Look, I know we haven't seen each other since the, um... 
 Look, I just I really think we need to talk. 
 Andy, it's cool. It was what it was, okay? 
 What... what? What do you mean, "it was what it was"? 
 Look, I know it's your specialty, but let's... let's try not to overthink this one, okay? 
 You're not gonna try that again. 
 Hey, you. 
 Soweare all set for tonight. 
 Yeah. You know, um... Luke, I don't... I don't really know if tonight's... 
 Hey, no, no. It's okay. I already talked to Swarek. 
 You did? 
 Yeah, it's all fine. 
 As far as he's concerned, you're all mine. 
 Great. Yeah. That's... that's great. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, Millben Tech or Renfield Prep? 
 Prep. All the way. 
 No, high school's bad enough. 
 I don't want to deal with a bunch of entitled rich kids. 
 Excuse me. That's my alma mater. 
 Figures. 
 All right, we'll take tech. This is gonna be awesome. 
 Yeah, awesome. 
 Bad associations, huh? 
 Well, you know, teen mom, unpopular, shunned. 
 Kids can be so cruel. yeah. Kids. 
 Have fun. 
 Can you please try to take it a little slower on the speed bumps? 
 You know, it figures you're hungover. 
 We're going back to high school. We're supposed to be hungover. 
 You volunteered us for the snobbiest school in the city. 
 Uh... pfft. I went there. 
 It holds a special place in my heart. 
 Yeah, you keep saying. 
 I thought your parents were hippies. 
 They were. My grandma paid. It was amazing. 
 I mean, the second I got there, I was, like, anointed the king of Renfield Prep. 
 I'm in student council, cheerleading... 
 Cheerleading? 
 Yeah. It was a coed spirit thing. 
 Well, school spirit's not really my thing, because high school was not the best time in my life. 
 You're cute and fun. 
 How bad could it have been? 
 Um, well, I spent six months trying to hide the fact that I was pregnant, and, uh, the next two years trying to hide from all the fallout. 
 So yeah, it was amazing. Oh, look, a speed bump! 
 What if they ask you, "what's your favorite thing about being a cop?" what do you say? 
 Well, I'm gonna say the feeling of polyester pants after you start to sweat a bit. 
 Seriously. I mean, how do you choose? 
 I love everything about this job. 
 I guess I could start with that. 
 Oh, Chris. It's a high school seminar, okay, not a final exam. Relax. 
 Here. 
 Are you afraid they're gonna ask you what it's like to shoot someone? 
 Uh, n... no. Um.. 
 You think they will? 
 Well, yeah. I mean, I... I would. 
 Look, Andy, you did what you had to do. 
 All right? You did your job. 
 Most cops, after something like that, everything starts to fall apart... their job, relationships. 
 Well, you still got your head screwed on straight. 
 All right? You got it together. You're solid. 
 Yeah. Solid. 
 Okay, we all know the rules. 
 Okay? The attacker wears a padded suit. 
 The officer has to fend off the attacker using his or her baton. 
 First one to make the other submit wins. 
 Thank you. Single malt. 
 Older than all of you put together. Value price... $880. 
 It goes to the copper with the best time. 
 That'd be me. 
 Hey, boss, uh... 
 I know only the unis are required to retrain, but I think it's only fair that we give the detectives a shot at the booze, too. 
 That is, uh, if the suits think they're up to it. 
 Detectives? Hold on. You want... you want to unleash these bad boys? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, I love it. 
 As much as we have, uh, cases to solve and... and murderers to put in jail, we believe it's our civic duty to assist in the reeducation of our fellow officers. 
 Oh, okay, okay. Bring it. 
 Okay, uh, Peck, clear the board. The D's are in. 
 This is a high school? 
 Technically, it's a preparatory academy. 
 Dude, you went to school in a palace. 
 Sorry. 
 Chris! 
 Look, again, I'm really sorry about the miscommunication. 
 Are you absolutely sure we got the dates mixed up? 
 I'm sure. You were scheduled for yesterday. 
 Yeah, we probably should've just called to double-check. 
 Well, hey, maybe we can come by another day. 
 Well, we have another outreach day scheduled for next semester. 
 What? N... next semester? 
 Yes. 
 Do you know how far that... 
 Chris! I'm sorry. My partner was just really excited about the talk. 
 Yeah. A... again, I'm sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 W... wait. What about saturday? Maybe they can come... 
 Let's go. Yeah, let's go. Thank you. 
 Unbelievable. I can't believe we mixed the dates up. I mean, maybe it's me. 
 No, it's not you. It's definitely me. I'm cursed. 
 No, you're just having a rough week, okay? 
 Traci said you might be going up to a cabin tonight. 
 That might be fun. You can relax. 
 You know, take it easy, forget all your problems. 
 Mm. Yeah. 
 Whoa. Hold up. sir, Do you need some help? 
 I'm okay. Okay... no, no. It's okay! 
 Hey, no. Wait, wait! Oh! 
 He's just... what's the problem, sir? 
 Dispach, this is 1505. 
 Alleyway west of Bloor and Brunswick. We need an ambulance now. 
 Yeah, we were driving down Brunswick when it happened. Yeah. 
 Well, yeah, it's a new boozecan called Viper. 
 Apparently they're serving till noon. 
 Uh, yeah, the victim's name is Jake Plummer. He's 24 years old. 
 And the medics say he's in rough shape, but he's stable enough to talk. 
 Sir? Sir? 
 Okay, I'd like to inform you I'm about to take your statement, okay? 
 I don't want any trouble. 
 Okay, good. Neither do we. 
 So why don't you just do your best to tell me exactly what happened last night? 
 Or... or this morning, I mean. 
 I don't remember. 
 I was... I was dancing. 
 A couple of guys came up. They s... suckered me. 
 Black? White? Skinny? Fat? 
 Any sort of description on their look? 
 Sir, can you hear me? 
 Sorry, Officer. We gotta roll now. 
 Okay. Okay, sir. We're on it. 
 Hey. 
 Did you get a statement? 
 Not much of one. 
 What did Detective Barber say? 
 No community service, so... I guess it's ours. 
 Okay. 
 So... 
 You guys gonna shut us down? 
 Still deciding. It might help if you step up and tell us something about this beating. 
 Kid said he was dancing, couple of guys jumped him. 
 It happens. The right dance moves with the wrong dude's girlfriend. 
 Did you see the guys that did this? 
 Jamaicans. Two brothers. 
 In here all the time. 
 If I give you 5 bucks, will you taser me and remind me I'm alive? 
 You know what I love? 
 Wrapping up early, heading back to the barn? 
 This school. You see that corner? 
 I got to second base with Sabine Mazursky right there in that corner... 
 Tenth grade school dance. 
 Do you have any idea how hard it is to get to second base at a dance I'm not really interested hearing how you groped some poor girl during a cheesy power ballad. 
 Well, that's because you're boring. 
 Now I'm gonna go flirt with the mothers against bulimia. 
 Ladies. 
 So have a couple of questions about being a cop. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Do they give you a uniform, or is it like fast food joint where they make you pay? 
 I just admire that you can make ends meet on that salary. 
 But don't feel bad... not even a supermodel could pull that outfit off. 
 What about you? You got one, too? 
 Come on, girls. Snack time. 
 M.A.B. love. I got some digits. 
 Just like old times. 
 Yeah, just like old times. 
 So you questioned the Viper victim? 
 Oh, yes, sir. 
 No, no. I... I don't need your notes, Diaz. Just give me the highlights. 
 Kay, well, the victim was really out of it. 
 He was actually beaten pretty bad. 
 Um, but the doorman I.D.'d two Jamaicans. 
 Yeah, brothers. Said they were regulars. 
 Right. Well, that sounds like a slam dunk. 
 Go down and see if you can't get a bead on these guys. 
 All right. 
 Next heat is Officer Williams versus Detective Watson! 
 Why are the detectives taking part in the retrain? 
 Oh, Sammy threw down the gauntlet. He said we didn't have the stones. 
 I think he's gonna be sorry. 
 So we should probably head back down to the Viper lounge for that follow-up. 
 Uh, yeah. Can you just give me a minute, okay? 
 I'm gonna meet you in the cruiser in ten. 
 Yeah, s... sure, I'll... I'll see you in ten. 
 How's mom? 
 What? Why would you ask that? 
 She's fine. 
 Shut up. 
 Steve, what are you doing here? Oh, hey. 
 I... I actually think he's here to check up on me, believe it or not. oh. 
 I... pfft. You kidding? You didn't think I'd miss this gong show, did you? 
 I can't believe the D's agreed to be part of it. 
 Oh, Chris, uh, this is my partner. 
 Hey, nice to meet you. Derek Bibby. 
 Yeah, I've seen you before at the penny. 
 Steve told me about that huge heroin bust you had last, uh, November. That... 
 Yeah. About $26 million worth, dozens of guys off the streets. 
 Brace yourself, Diaz. You're about to get the full Bibby. 
 All right, I think should get back in there. 
 Yeah, an ass-kisser's job is never done. 
 Would you look at that? 
 Our time is up. 
 Any interest in vice and narcotics, Diaz? 
 Oh, yeah, definitely. You mean, running on the spin team catching bad guys? 
 Yeah, yeah. I heard you, uh, caught one down at the Viper this morning. 
 Yeah, it was totally weird. We were just rolling along and then bam! 
 There he was, beaten half to death. 
 Whoa. Did he say what happened? 
 Danced with the wrong guy's girl. Yeah? 
 Doorman gave up two Jamaicans. 
 We're just about to check it out. 
 Hey, I'm not surprised. 
 Our guys have been watching that boozecan for weeks. 
 Hey, if anything comes up, let us know. 
 Yeah. 
 And next time you're down at the penny, come by our table for a pint, and I'll introduce you to some of the guys. 
 Wha... really? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, man. 
 All right. 
 Well, it was nice to meet you, Derek. 
 Yep. 
 Attacker, are you ready? Officer, are you ready? 
 I'm ready! 
 Bring it on. 
 Come on, punk. You want a piece of me? 
 Yeah! 
 Come on, come on. Let's go! 
 Hey. Hi. Sam! 
 Can I talk to you for a second? 
 Wh... what is it, McNally? 
 I already told your boyfriend I'm not gonna hold you back from the love shack. 
 He doesn't want to hit traffic. Come on! 
 It's not even like that, okay? 
 Come on! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 I wanna see blood! Push him! Push him! Aah! 
 Oh, come on! 
 50 seconds! 
 Yeah! Whoo! 50 seconds. Now that's a time to beat. 
 It really breaks down to the three different types... 
 And what part of criminology are you interested in? 
 Help! Somebody, please help! 
 She's totally fishing out right now, and I'm pretty sure she's gonna die! Please! 
 All right, everybody step back. 
 What's her name? 
 Brianna. 
 Brianna, can you hear me? 
 What's going on? Does she normally have seizures? 
 No. This shouldn't be happening. 
 We need a medic. 
 Dispatch, this is 1502. 
 I need an ambulance at Renfield prep immediately. 
 Brianna, can you open your eyes? Brianna? 
 Haven't you had enough of visiting our workplace? 
 Is your brother here, sir? 
 Yes, ma'am. Peter! Babylon a-come visit. 
 You've identified as possible assailants in a vicious beating that occurred outside the Viper early this morning. 
 A beating? What's this about? 
 Could you put the wrench down, sir? 
 Ah, they claim we took part in a beating. 
 You guys love harassing people. It's too much. 
 We're not harassing you, sir. 
 Well, are you saying that the doorman at the Viper was lying? 
 The man cannot think for himself. 
 Babylon has to pay the boy to face us. 
 You ever seen this man before? 
 This dude? He bought us a round of shots. 
 Yeah, he the one was being shadowed by Babylon. 
 Are you saying that the victim was being followed by a police officer? 
 The fella that was after your boy was definitely a cop. 
 Yeah, he's been trying lock us up for years now... 
 One boy named Bibby. 
 Bibby? 
 That's your boy. 
 So Detective Bibby, the guy who beat the victim... 
 I mean, allegedly... you actually know him? 
 Sorta. Vice and narcotics guy. Works with Steve Peck. 
 Gail's brother. 
 Okay. 
 Look, I should've been honest. It's just that coworkers aren't really supposed to date. It gets messy, and... 
 Chris. 
 I'm seeing Gail. Yeah. 
 You're... oh. 
 Anyways... 
 Okay. 
 The point is... is that Bibby was at the station earlier asking about Jake, guy in the alley. 
 He says it was related to a case he's working. 
 Yeah, well, those two witnesses just said that he's the one that beat the guy up and put him in the hospital. 
 Okay, this is a fellow officer we're talking about. 
 Yeah, you think I don't know that? 
 Okay. First rule of police work, at least according to my father... 
 You never open your mouth against another officer, not unless you know exactly what the deal is. 
 Amphetamines, maybe. 
 It's hard to tell with these drug cocktails. 
 It'd be great to know what we're dealing with. 
 I'm on it. I'll call you. 
 All right, stay here. 
 They say brianna wasn't high. 
 The medics say different, and they're not gonna know how to help her unless they know exactly what she took. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 We don't know if any of it's true, but we just thought that... 
 I thought you'd know what's going on. 
 Like, we didn't want to just walk up the line with this, so... 
 I don't know. 
 I've known Bibby, uh, ten years. 
 There's gotta be an explanation. 
 There's gotta be. 
 He's a good cop. An impeccable record. 
 I know. 
 You know, with that said, if he did anything illegal... 
 I mean, hell, you know my family, that we do not abide. 
 No, no. There's no way. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you, guys for bringing this to me. 
 I'll keep you posted. 
 
 
 
 Drugs? 
 You think brianna was on drugs? 
 Re you mental? 
 If we don't know what she took, the doctors can't help her. 
 Okay, what is wrong with you? 
 Your friend is in the hospital after inhaling amphetamines. 
 Do you not care? 
 Ampheta-whatever. 
 Speed, which can kill you. 
 Okay, my Dad's a lawyer. 
 This is harassment. 
 And we have to get back to our studies. Excuse me. 
 Well, that was informative. 
 Actually, it was. We need to get their schedules. 
 It's gonna be fine. Steve's gonna figure it out. 
 We've just got to wait it out. 
 Yeah. 
 Excuse me. 
 Uh, I'm looking for Officers McNally and Diaz. 
 Uh, yeah, that's us. Can we help you? 
 I'm Lily... 
 Derek Bibby's sister. 
 Do you guys have a minute? 
 Alone? 
 I shouldn't be here. This is all my fault. 
 Okay, just take a deep breath. Tell us what's going on. 
 My brother... he... he called me this morning. 
 He said... he said Jake wouldn't be bothering me anymore. 
 Jake? 
 Uh, the guy that got beaten. Jake Plummer, right? 
 Do you know him? 
 He's my boyfriend. 
 I mean... well, he was. 
 It's... it's okay. Take your time. 
 It wasn't working out. 
 I... I thought we were on the same page, but then... one night last week, I tried to end things with him, but he got really aggressive. 
 He hurt you? 
 He said he wanted to be together one last time, but I didn't want to, so... I can't even say it. 
 He assaulted you. 
 And you told your brother. 
 Derek just got carried away. 
 He's my older brother, you know? 
 He's protective. 
 Yeah, but if Jake assaulted you, that's really serious. 
 You need to press charges. 
 No, please. I just want this to go away. 
 Please? Just let it go. 
 I can't believe I'm thinking this, let alone gonna say it out loud. 
 You think she was lying, too. 
 I mean... averted eye contact, she was touching her nose a bunch of times, and she said it hap... 
 It happened one night last week." 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, it's textbook lying, right? 
 Look, Andy, these types of situations... 
 I know the woman has to be believed, but... 
 You think Bibby put her up to it? 
 He must've, but... 
 Peck called him. 
 Yeah. Steve Peck must've called him, right? 
 No way. No way Steve would do that. 
 Oh, come on, Chris. They're partners, okay? 
 You look out for each other. That's what partners do. 
 I should never have went to him. 
 So what do we do now? 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 You lied to us. 
 I told you. I... I don't remember anything. 
 Concealing evidence, obstruction of justice, sexual assault. the are you talking about? 
 Your girlfriend Lily... you remember her? 
 We just took her statement. She's saying that you raped her. 
 No. 
 Yeah, that her brother went after you as retaliation. 
 Come on. That's insane. 
 What would you say if I told you that we have evidence taken from a rape kit last week? 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 You're setting me up. 
 All right, look, I swear to God, I didn't rape anybody. 
 Lily said this? About me? 
 You're all in on this. 
 We're not in on anything. 
 But you have to tell us what really happened. 
 I was on the deck at their house... having a smoke. I saw him. 
 Detective Bibby? 
 Derek, Lily's brother. He was in the driveway. 
 He was pulling stuff out of his car and shoving it into an old golf bag that he keeps in the back of his garage. 
 It was stupid, but... the next night I checked it out. 
 Must've been 50 grand, easy, stuffed in the golf bag. 
 It's either stolen or drug money, right? 
 I thought he wouldn't do anything if a handful went missing. 
 Last night he told me that, uh, if I talked to anyone, that if any cop ever found me... he'd come finish the job. 
 So the kid took money that Derek Bibby stole from evidence or off the street, so Derek beats the living crap out of him, puts him in the hospital, then gets his own sister to tell us some B.S. story about getting raped. 
 Blowing the whistle on something like this? 
 I mean, we're not even fully fledged cops yet. 
 What, you just want to turn our backs and make it all go away? 
 Hey, losers. I heard your high school thing got canceled. 
 I got paperwork to do. 
 Whoa. What's her problem? Meh, who cares? 
 Hey, listen, you really got stick around and watch these T.O's try to prove that they've still got it. 
 It is so precious. 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Oh, yeah. I'm just... 
 I'm just tired. 
 Oh. I did kinda keep you up late last night, although you didn't seem to mind. 
 Peck! Next heat. 
 Okay, I gotta go. 
 You know what? I'm gonna take this one. 
 All right. 
 Samantha? 
 What? Are you following me? 
 Look, I know you're not like those other girls. 
 I looked at your schedules, and Robin and Suzie are taking bird courses, while you're loaded up with biology and chemistry, advanced mathematics. 
 So? 
 So you're here on scholarship. 
 You're not just a social butterfly who doesn't care. 
 Listen, hey. Hey, come on. Talk to me. 
 If I'm gonna help your friend, I need to know what she was on. 
 If Robin knew I was talking to you... 
 So what, this Robin chick is making you guys take amphetamines? 
 To se weight and, you know, for the buzz. 
 It's totally safe, though, as long as you're not on any meds that are contraindicated, and Bri said she wasn't. 
 Okay. Well, at least now I know what she was on. 
 Can I go? 
 Yeah. 
 Samantha? 
 How long have you been getting it for them? 
 What? 
 Those other girls... your friends... they wouldn't even know how to spell contraindicated, " let alone know what it means. 
 I don't understand. 
 I think you do. 
 Can you do that, $2, 500? That totally works. I can do that. 
 Ahem. listen, can it be in installments? 
 That would be a lot easier for me. 
 You can stop avoiding me now. 
 Listen, man, can I call you back? 
 I... I... yeah, I'll call you back. 
 All right. Okay, bye. Avoiding you? 
 Yeah, running away every time you see me? 
 Fine, it was what it was. Whatever. 
 You know, I'm not gonna overthink it. 
 But you're still my training officer, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, that means that I can come to you with a problem, no matter what that problem is or who that problem is with. 
 Sure. What, you and Callaghan fighting over who gets top bunk at the cabin? 
 Oh, that's hilarious. I'm referring to a case, Sam. 
 You know what? Screw it. 
 Nice job. Time to beat still belongs to Officer Williams. 
 All right. Everyone, let's clear the mat for our next matchup. 
 Let's see who's up next. 
 Okay, next heat we got Swarek and Callaghan. 
 Here we go. Looks like we're up, buddy. 
 Yeah. Suit up. 
 Girlfight! 
 Always keep your eye on your opponent! Let's go. 
 Okay, let's do this. 
 All right, let's do it. 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Hit him harder! 
 Hey, you like that? 
 Come on, come on. Come on! Get up! Get up! 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 Come on, Sam! Get up! 
 That's it. 
 Hey, that's enough! 
 Sam! That's enough! 
 Come on! 
 Okay, Swarek! Swarek, enough! 
 That was crazy. You see the way Swarek went after Detective Callaghan? 
 What the hell was that about? 
 I... I have no idea. 
 Chris, we have to go talk to Detective Bibby. 
 A...  and say what? 
 We can't accuse a senior officer of stealing evidence. 
 Yeah, well, we can't just leave it, either. 
 I mean, we have to at least get his side of the story. 
 I say we take ourselves out of the equation. 
 Besides, it's not our job anyways. 
 All right, we don't investigate other cops. 
 Other cops? What, Steve Peck? 
 Who just happens to be related to your girlfriend? 
 Okay, Gail's not my girlfriend. 
 She... she... well, I don't know what she is yet. I... 
 Actually, yeah, sure. Maybe... maybe I don't want to get involved. 
 We were the responding officers. We're already involved. 
 Then we'll tell Detective Barber Lily's allegations of assault, step away from it. 
 Oh, okay. So you just want to pass the buck and let the detectives decide? 
 Everyone's gonna hate us. 
 Well, you need to figure out what's more important... being liked or telling the truth. 
 What are you... you can't do this. 
 This isn't even a code one emergency. 
 What about the manual? 
 Screw the manual. 
 Oh, hey, Diaz. This your partner? 
 Let me buy you two a drink. 
 I don't think so. 
 We need to talk to you. 
 Yeah, sure thing. 
 Why don't we go somewhere a little more private? 
 No, this is good. Out here in the open is good. 
 My sister told me that she explained the, uh... situation. 
 I didn't ask her to come to you, okay? 
 She did that on her own, so... 
 I don't believe you. 
 Are you calling my sister a liar? no. 
 Okay. 
 Watch it, rookie. 
 We know about Jake stealing the money. 
 We just want to hear your side of things. 
 Where'd the money come from? 
 No idea what you're talking about. 
 Was it evidence? 
 Okay, look, I think you should be very careful where you're stepping right now. 
 You've done your little bit of police work. 
 Gold stars all around. 
 And now it's over. 
 Time to go after some real bad guys. 
 We're asking you to tell us what happened. 
 If you don't, you're gonna leave us no choice. 
 In order to maintain the integrity of the service... 
 The service? 
 What the hell do you know about the service? 
 You've been a cop for what, four months? 
 And you have the balls to come in here and accuse me? 
 Okay, you know what? Just get out of my face. 
 If you don't come clean, we're gonna have to take what we know upstairs. 
 You do, and I will systematically destroy your reputations in this service, as you know I can do. This is a brotherhood. 
 You step outside of that, and you're nothing. 
 And who do you think they're gonna believe, huh? 
 Some rookie with a train wreck for an old man, some kid who doesn't know how to wipe his own ass yet, or a detective with an impeccable record who's been on an elite task force for nine years? 
 You're nothing! You hear me? 
 You are nothing but a tube of lipstick and a badge. 
 You two realize what you're saying? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Why didn't you come to one of us with this earlier? 
 They tried, and I was, uh, distracted. I didn't listen. 
 Okay. 
 We'll start making the appropriate calls, have this dealt with, but I'm not sure I'll be able to keep you two out of it. 
 Dismissed. 
 What are you saying? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, you... you obviously do. 
 I mean, to sit here and tell me that my brother was... 
 I'm not saying Steve's involved. 
 But you are implying it. 
 Look, you... you really think I wanted to do this? 
 No, you are the one who reported it. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 I... I don't know. 
 I mean, Steve is my brother. 
 I have really, uh, no idea what I'm supposed to say to you. 
 Can I have the same? Thanks. 
 So, you went back to school today, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Did you, uh... you learn anything new? 
 Yeah, you know. same old, same old. 
 High school is high school. 
 Kids will do anything to fit in. 
 Yeah. 
 Detective Barber, saw you come in, got you this. 
 Lemon drop, right? 
 Yeah. Good man. 
 Uh, hey, if you or any other D's want something to drink later, uh, just tell the bartender you're with Epstein. I got a tab going. 
 Thanks, Epstein. I'll be sure to work that. 
 No problem. 
 What is going on with those two? 
 Nothing. No, I mean... I... Nothing that I know about. 
 I don't know anything. Why? Are you... 
 What? Okay. You didn't hear it from me... 
 Steve. 
 Diaz giving you the full report? 
 I.A. investigation is already underway, Bibby's suspended without pay till it's over. 
 That could take months. 
 What about you? 
 I had nothing to do with this. 
 Listen, I told you to let me handle it, okay? 
 But no, Mr. By-the-book here just screwed a good man out of his job. 
 Okay. All right. There's peop... 
 And for what? 
 A little punk-ass thief. 
 You obviously don't get what it means to be a real cop. 
 I'd watch your back, Diaz, 'cause no one else is going to. 
 You coming? 
 Don't, don't. 
 Gail, you coming? 
 N... no. G... 
 All right, coppers! 
 Coppers, come on, listen up, listen up. 
 Can I have your attention, please? 
 For her superior achievements of serious ass-kicking, I would like to present this... prize bottle to Officer Noelle Williams. 
 Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
 So many people to mention. 
 So many little, little people. 
 Open up that scotch already! 
 Oh, my God. 
 You are so lucky that I wasn't there today. 
 I would've totally kicked your ass. 
 Buddy, let me see the war wound. 
 Oh, I look like the bride of Frankenstein, pal. 
 Well, okay. Come here. Give me some love. 
 All right. Easy with the ribs, huh? 
 I know. 
 Give me some love. 
 Epstein! 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Drinks on me. 
 Thank you. 
 Things all right with Gail? 
 No. 
 Chris. 
 So we told the truth. 
 I'm starting to think I'd rather be liked. 
 These seats taken? 
 No, please. 
 Uh, excuse me. Move over. 
 Oh, in your dreams. 
 Okay. 
 You got some 'splainin' to do. 
 I can't believe you're sleeping with frosty. 
 What? She guessed. 
 I'm gonna be right back. 
 Did she know? You knew. 
 I didn't know. 
 I didn't know. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It took a lot of guts... reporting a vice squad guy like that. 
 Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't believe that. 
 I'm... I'm sorry I didn't listen to you before. 
 Me, too. 
 No, Andy... 
 You were right. 
 Okay? It was what it was. 
 Have nice trip. 
 Hey. 
 You're not thinking of backing out on me, are you? 
 I'm all yours.
