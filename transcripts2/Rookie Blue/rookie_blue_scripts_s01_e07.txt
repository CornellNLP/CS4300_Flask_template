 McNally, what's your 20? 
 Suspect just entered the alley behind windham. 
 Where's he headed, McNally. 
 Heading west. 
 Police! Stop! 
 We'll cut him on the front gate. 
 You reached for a broken soul, disembodied. 
 Sir, just relax. I'm not trying to hurt you. 
 Shell of a person... 
 Sir, drop the weapon. 
 And with his mighty blade, he silences the world...  And sets himself... 
 No. 
 Yeah, I keep telling you, it's not the heat. It's the insanity. 
 I'm okay. Thank you. 
 He's clean. 
 All right, well, the overwhelming smell of urine would seem to contradict that, but galahad, let's get you back to the castle. 
 One, two, three. 
 And on three again. Three. 
 Dispatch, 1519. We've got the... 
 He was coming at you pretty hard. 
 Yeah. 
 Why didn't you draw your gun? 
 I don't know. I guess I just thought that... 
 Don't. 
 Don't what? 
 Don't overthink it, okay? That feeling in your gut... you gotta learn to listen to it. 
 It's telling you what you need to do. 
 You gotta learn to trust it. 
 Okay. 
 All right? You all right? 
 How the hell did you sleep through that? 
 Sleep through what? 
 See? This is what I'm talking about. 
 Hey, Dale! Dale! 
 Hey, officer... sir. 
 You blocked me in again, man. I need you to move your truck. 
 Uh... dude, I'm in no condition. 
 Okay, well, that's fine. Just... look, just give me your keys, and I'll move it for you. 
 Right. Keys... are... 
 All right, settle, settle. 
 Day 7 of a 7-day stretch. 
 It was record temperatures this week, and the good news is it's gonna be even hotter today. 
 I know, I know. We're all running on empty. 
 But I do have three critical words of advice for the rookies... suck it up! Fox. 
 E.M.S. is overwhelmed, so we're pitching in where we can. 
 And remember, we gotta stay visible so the bad guys know we're out there. 
 This kind of heat, people aren't themselves, but it's our job to keep our cool. That's right. 
 It's a good thing some of us are just born that way. 
 All right, people, it's our last shift. 
 Ten more hours, and we all get our lives back. 
 Till then, they belong to the city. 
 That's right, so serve, protect and whatever. Go the hell home. 
 Ten more hours? I cannot tell you how much I'm looking forward to peeling off this uniform. 
 And then may I suggest a group bubble bath... 
 You know, conserve water, save the planet. 
 Next couple days, it's just me and my little guy... whatever he wants. 
 Yeah, well, I just can't wait to be a few days away from Swarek. 
 He's made me ride shotgun every day this week. 
 You know, everything I do is wrong. 
 It's like he doesn't trust me. 
 You're a great cop. 
 If Swarek doesn't trust you, he's an idiot. 
 Well, I think he knows exactly what he's doing. 
 Think about it. He spends all day with a... relatively attractive young woman, who hangs on his every word, files his reports, makes his coffee... 
 I mean, why would he give that up? 
 You're like his hot secretary with a gun. 
 Man-boy actually has a point. 
 Hey, at least he likes you. 
 I gotta spend the next ten hours with Gail. 
 Now there's a cop who needs to lighten up. 
 Cameras. 
 There's no cameras in here. 
 I'm pretty sure... 
 I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to be doing this right now. 
 Oh, my God. Please don't tell me you're thinking about protocol right now. 
 Mm. Mm. No, no. 
 It's just that I haven't got a full night's sleep in three days, and my neighbor's an idiot. 
 And I had to ride the bus to work today -. What... 
 What... is... your point? Do you think... 
 Uh, just... just not at work. 
 Okay? 
 Fine. 
 No. Good day, officer. 
 No, Gail. No... whatever. 
 That's what you look like. 
 Could've sworn you had longer sideburns. 
 I could've sworn you were a redhead. 
 Sorry I didn't make it by last night. 
 I.D.E.N.T. went long on the Lakeshore stabbing, .so I decided to stay and finish it up. 
 Ah, your loss. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, 'cause last night included me with ice cream... naked. 
 In that case... 
 McNally. 
 Okay, so I'll see you tonight? 
 Count on it. 
 Great. 
 It's true. You look tired. 
 Charming. 
 Hey, some guys think dark circles give a woman's face character. 
 Callaghan doesn't seem to mind. 
 Yeah, well, he spends more time with dead people, so it's really not that hard to impress him. 
 Hard to get your downtime in sync? 
 Yeah, well, you know, it's not a big deal. 
 It's only been a couple weeks. 
 A working Detective's kind of like undercover. 
 You always got an open case, get pretty wrapped up, lose sight of what's right in front of you. 
 This is 1505, um, Eastbound on Queen and Sumach. 
 Uh, we're in pursuit of an... ice cream truck. 
 You're in pursuit of what? 
 It's a white Mr. Delightful truck. 
 It has bells on it. 
 Police. Pull over. 
 Hey! Get your hands up! 
 Wasn't me! 
 Get your hands up! Get out of the car! 
 Get out! Get out of the truck, sir! 
 Okay. I wasn't... I... I wasn't even driving! 
 Out of the truck. 
 Shut up! Turn around. 
 1505. I need an ambulance... Queen and Logan. 
 Breaking the glass. 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Well, she's shaken up, but, uh, the medics say she's gonna be okay. 
 She's fine, you know? 
 Yeah, what about you? 
 I don't mean to sound like your mother, but I think you need stitches. 
 Eh, it's okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. 
 Let's see this. 
 Dhara Singh... 13. 
 Why is a 13-year-old driving an ice cream truck? 
 I told you, I have no idea, okay? 
 I was over at Garrison Park. 
 I closed for ten minutes to restock. 
 Next thing I know, bam, the truck takes off. 
 What, you kept it running? 
 Yeah. So? Look, I start it in the morning. 
 It goes all day, okay? 
 I'm the victim here, remember? 
 You know how much money I'm gonna lose? 
 These things are 6 bucks each. 
 6 bucks? 
 It's heat wave prices, okay? This is a business, okay? 
 Now I want that little bitch arrested. 
 I'm afraid we're gonna have to take some of these as evidence. 
 McNally? 
 Yeah, evidence, absolutely. 
 You better get some full ones there. Yeah. 
 I'm an idiot? 
 You're an idiot! 
 You're the one behind the wheel! Pay attention! 
 Shut up! 
 Body a" took body b's cab across town then refused to pay. 
 Body b" didn't like that so much. 
 Uh, who threw the first punch? 
 They both say it was the other guy. That's as far as I got. 
 Enjoy. 
 Come on. I got a plane to catch. 
 Yeah, well, you should have thought about that before going five rounds. 
 I was defending myself. This guy's crazy. 
 This man is a thief. I want to press charges. 
 I took him halfway across town. He won't pay. 
 Calm down, everybody, please. I'm gonna need both your names. 
 Look, I'm the one who should be pressing charges, okay? 
 This guy had no idea where he was going. 
 You said airport. 
 I said island airport. 
 No, you didn't! 
 How would you know? You were on the damn phone the whole time! 
 Just shut up, guys! 
 Man, look, why don't we put both of you in a cell, and you guys can figure it out on your own, huh? 
 Two men enter, one man leaves. 
 Okay, let's try this again. 
 Names, one at a time. 
 I did this with the lady in the car already. 
 Ugh! This is so lame. 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 Ladies, don't forget to stay hydrated... 
 Thanks. 
 And supple and delicious. 
 What are you, 12? 
 Uh, no. I enjoy my job. We're guardians of public safety -in a time of crisis. Water? 
 Thank you. 
 No, dov, we're actually handing out refreshments to people who aren't smart enough to realize that they're thirsty. 
 You know, negative, negative. 
 The red brick house up the street... 
 I don't know what the hell is happening, but I think somebody's in trouble. 
 Let's go. 
 Police! Open the door. 
 I'm... it's okay, really. I just dropped my salad. 
 Is everything all right? 
 I'm gonna take that as a no. 
 This must be a mistake. 
 Dhara would never steal an ice cream truck. 
 She... she's not even allowed to eat ice cream. 
 Sir, we found her behind the wheel. 
 Well, who put you up to it? 
 It was that little fat girl, wasn't it? 
 The one whose mom lets her put the piercings in her ears. 
 No, it wasn't. 
 So who was it? 
 Dhara, please. 
 Just tell the police officers what happened. 
 I don't know. I don't remember. 
 Sweetie, what about your feet? 
 Do you remember how you got tar on them? 
 Mr. Singh, maybe your wife has some idea? 
 My wife is gone. 
 It's just the two of us. 
 Do we seriously have to charge her? 
 What? The kid went joyriding and damaged public property. 
 We don't have a choice. Yeah, well, it doesn't make any sense. 
 Why? You know her? 
 Latchkey kid, single Dad who works too many hours? 
 Yeah, I kind of do know her. 
 Oh. So you never rebelled? 
 Yeah, of course I rebelled. I put on too much eye makeup or maybe made out with the wrong guy. 
 I never stole an ice cream truck. 
 Come on. Let's just go back to Garrison Park, and, you know, see if anybody saw anything? 
 It's a minor charge on a very busy day. 
 We just don't have the time, okay? 
 Sam. 
 Hey, Monica. W... what are you doing here? 
 How are... how are you? 
 Uh, A.C.'s out in lockup. 
 Now you've got six law-abiding citizens in there complaining of chest pains. 
 They're calling me over from St. Mike's to see which ones are legit. 
 Good. 
 Hi. Monica. 
 Andy. 
 That's McNally, my, uh, new rookie. 
 Right. 
 What happened to your hand? 
 Oh, it's f... it's nothing. It's fine. 
 Let me see. 
 Oh, it's... no, this is deep. You need stitches. 
 That's what I said. 
 Can we get an R.N., please? 
 Sorry. I've gotta go give nitro to some lardass. 
 Give me ten minutes. 
 Yeah. 
 Actually, we're just on our way to interview some witnesses at Garrison Park, so... 
 I wasn't asking. 
 Okay. 
 So about those witnesses that we're gonna go interview... you know, I'm good to go on my own. 
 Shaw! 
 Yeah? 
 Are you free to take McNally over to Garrison Park? 
 Well, what's in it for me? 
 Uh, she'll do the paperwork for your last five shifts. 
 She's pretty good. 
 Five shifts, huh? 
 Yeah. A lot of paperwork. 
 Yeah, I'll take a ride. 
 All righty. Good to go. 
 All right. 
 Thank you, Sammy. 
 It's false labor. I'm not due for another month. 
 Well, do you have a husband or... a partner? 
 I have a husband... Eric. He's in New York. 
 But it's okay because he's coming back tonight. 
 Well, it might be a good idea to just see your doctor just to be sure. 
 Okay. I'm gonna do that. 
 You get your groceries delivered? 
 That is so cool, you know? I was thinking about doing that, but I kind of like to pick out my own produce... you know, tap the, uh, melons. 
 I don't eat melon. 
 Okay. I just... 
 I have so much work I want to do on the baby's room. 
 So if you could just... 
 Okay, okay. Uh, we're gonna get you an ambulance. 
 No! No ambulance! I'm fine. 
 That is not fine. 
 Oh, God. My water broke. 
 Whoa, hey, don't. Don't. 
 Until they make vests that breathe, that A.C. is staying on full blast. 
 Full blast? 
 You know, in case you hadn't noticed, McNally, most people are pretty stupid, you know, and this heat just makes 'em crazy. 
 Stupid and crazy, that's just... that's a bad combination. 
 Little bit of rain, everything's gonna go b... 
 Don't. 
 What? I was just gonna say... everything's gonna go back to normal... 
 We got a 9-1-1- call for shots fired at 85 Clifford Court. 
 Shots fired. 
 Dispatch, mark 1519 responding. 
 Thanks, McNally. 
 You're a peach. 
 Caller is Michelle Ivres, or I-vres. 
 Dispatch, 1519 on-scene, 85 Clifford Court. 
 Responding to shots fired. 
 Copy. 
 Man, I hate coming here. 
 Backup units, what's your eta? 
 1511... 
 1507. We're at... 
 Okay, eyes up, McNally. Eyes up. 
 You never know what's gonna come out of these windows. 
 You do realize this is your fault? 
 I didn't jinx us. 
 Yeah, honestly, you're not making it any better. 
 Please! 
 Stop! 
 No, you... you gotta help me! It's my daughter. 
 Your daughter's been shot? 
 No, she's gone. 
 She was supposed to be back by now. 
 There were no gunshots? 
 No. It's Aisha. She's missing. 
 Let me get this straight. 
 You reported gunshots because you can't find your daughter. 
 I didn't know what else to do. 
 I mean, you cops never come up to these projects unless you have to. 
 Dispatch, this is Shaw 1519. Disregard shots fired. 
 Cancel all other units. 
 Please. You... you have to help me. 
 How old is your daughter? 
 13. 
 How long has she been gone? 
 Um, about an hour and a half. 
 This is officer McNally. 
 She'll take your information, and we'll see what we can do. 
 Please don't make that call again. 
 My water just broke... so if you could call me back as soon as you get this? 
 Ambulances are backed up at least a half an hour, maybe more. 
 Oh, look, I don't need an ambulance, okay? 
 Eric and I were having a home birth. 
 I just left a message for my midwife, and now I'm calling my doula. 
 What is a doula? 
 Birth coach for hippies. 
 I thought a birth coach was a birth coach for hippies. 
 Aah! She's not in, either. 
 I'll go get the cruiser. 
 Anna, do you have an overnight bag? 
 But babies born at home come into the world in a much less stressful environment. 
 My doula is actually my yoga instructor! 
 Just please listen. 
 No! Stay away from me. 
 Anna, please! 
 Gail! 
 Gail, can I talk to you for a second? 
 We can't let some stupid hippie endanger her baby just 'cause she doesn't want to leave the house. 
 It's not that she doesn't want to. 
 I don't think she can. 
 Anna. 
 Anna... How long has it been since you left the house? 
 You've checked the neighborhood? 
 I've looked everywhere, but I've got Kiara, and... and with this heat, I had to come back in case she came home. 
 Okay, well, it's only been a while. 
 Maybe she's just out with some friends or something. 
 Aisha doesn't have a lot of friends. 
 She's quiet, you know? Real shy. 
 She wouldn't go nowhere without telling me. 
 Okay. You last saw her this morning? 
 She begged me to go, but Kiara's been sick, and with this heat, you know... 
 I mean, it's just a few blocks away. 
 Where did she want to go? 
 Garrison Park, the one with the spray fountain. 
 Yeah. 
 You don't think there's any chance that she ran away? 
 Cops always say that when girls go missing from this neighborhood. 
 No. I know my little girl did not run away. 
 Okay. 
 Name? 
 She asked you a question. - L-train. 
 Your real name, the one mama gave you. 
 I.D. says trainoff, Linus. 
 Linus? I guess mama didn't like you very much. 
 It says you were caught stealing air conditioners from Camden Towers. 
 So? 
 So that's a seniors residence. 
 If they don't want people taking them, then they shouldn't be stickin' 'em out the windows. 
 Oh, you think that's funny, huh? 
 A little bit. 
 This kind of heat, those people could have died. 
 What the hell's the matter with you? 
 What if that was your grandma, huh, Linus? 
 Ain't nothing. 
 Oh, it ain't no thing, huh? 
 How about we lock you in a hot box with no air and see how you do, huh? 
 You probably wouldn't find it that nice. 
 You'd probably find it a little hard to breathe, huh? 
 Officer Diaz, can I see you a minute? 
 
 
 
 Okay, listen, you gotta chill out. Do you want to get written up? 
 No. I'm sorry, okay? 
 I just don't want to be here. 
 Well, none of us want to be here right now, but that's not the point. You can't do that. 
 No, I don't mean here at work. I mean here in the city. 
 Look, it's just like, nobody gives a crap about anybody. 
 Everybody's all about themselves all the time, and I just... I just don't want to be one of those people. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 You sure? 
 Because right now this whole city... 
 J... just doesn't feel right. 
 It started about, um, six years ago with crowded places, mostly... um, the mall, grocery stores. 
 I just couldn't breathe. 
 It was like there was an elephant on my chest. 
 Okay. I can see why you'd want to avoid that. 
 Normally I'm fine with medication, but I stopped taking all of that about a year and a half ago when we started trying for the baby. 
 That is a long time to be inside. 
 I know. It sounds crazy. 
 No. No, no. It's a scary place out there. 
 I totally get it. 
 Some mornings I don't even want to get out of bed. 
 Then again, I am kind of lazy. 
 Uh, okay. Uh, Officer Peck? 
 Look, what? 
 Gail. Look, hey, listen, I can't get through to E.M.S., okay? 
 There's still no sign of them. 
 Go out to the cruiser. Get the first aid Kit. 
 Why? 
 I'm gonna get 9-1-1 on the phone. 
 They're gonna talk us through how to deliver a baby. Go. 
 Strange to have you waiting on me for a change. 
 Are you sure you've done this before? 
 You know, I kind of like this. Like I've got you on a string. 
 I thought you said you didn't want strings. 
 Sam, you're a cop. 
 You're supposed to be able to tell when people are lying. 
 So your new rookie. She is pretty. 
 No, I'm just her training officer, that's all. 
 How did you last so long undercover? 
 Sam, I'm a big girl. 
 Don't lead me on if you're really into someone else. 
 We're done. 
 Your hand. 
 Right. Thanks. 
 Um, I put in dissolvable sutures, so you don't have to see me again. 
 You need to talk to dhara again. 
 There might be another girl missing from this neighborhood. 
 Okay, you lost me. 
 Okay, Aisha Ivers disappeared from Garrison Park. 
 It's the same spot that dhara stole the ice cream truck. 
 McNally, hundreds of kids go to that park. 
 13, skinny, long, dark hair. Sound familiar? 
 Well, apparently, last summer, there were two girls, same age, same description, that also went missing from this neighborhood. 
 What? 
 Power's out. I'll call you back. 
 Just lost power at the station. 
 Yeah, not just the station. 
 Power's off across the whole city. 
 Rookie, our bad luck just got a whole lot worse. 
 Yeah, honking's gonna make the power come back on! 
 Hey, sorry. Have you seen this girl? 
 No? 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, girls, hi. 
 Listen, have you seen this little girl? 
 Her name's Aisha. No? You don't go to school with her? No? 
 I can't find anyone who's seen Aisha. 
 Power's out across the whole city.. 
 People got other things on their mind... end of the world, gettin' laid or how $80 worth of meat in my freezer has got, like, two hours before it goes off. 
 So what, we shouldn't even look for her? 
 No, no. We did look. We just couldn't find her. 
 Andy, uh, the girl's 13. 
 Aisha. Aisha is 13, and around here, that's practically a grown-up. 
 Probably she just had a fight with her mom 'cause she didn't like her boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever. 
 Now she's punishing mom by playing hide-and-seek. 
 The girl who stole the ice cream truck... you said that she had, uh, fresh tar on her feet? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, come check this out. What does that look like to you? 
 Aisha? 
 She's not a cocker spaniel. 
 You know, you take upstairs. Five minutes. 
 And if she's not here, we gotta... we gotta get back to business. 
 Emergency services are overloaded. 
 I keep getting cut off. 
 All right. Well, we got this. 
 Can you not be stupid right now? 
 We have to get that woman to a hospital. 
 You know, she's obviously not in her right mind, endangering herself... and her baby. 
 I say we just arrest her and take her in. 
 Gail, she's terrified. 
 Stressing her out is the last thing we want to do. 
 We just need to keep her calm and maybe deliver the baby. 
 It's no big deal. 
 Okay. Just because we watched that really gross video at the academy does not mean we know how to do this. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 So... how are we doing in here? 
 I'm pretty sure I'm having a baby! 
 Oh, good. 
 Can you see how far I'm dilated? 
 Oh, God. I see the head. 
 Uh, you worked with a birth coach, right? 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Okay, good. Here's what I need you to do. 
 I want you to take Gail's hand and teach her how to breathe. 
 You can... you can do that, right? 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Gail, hand, now! 
 Here we... 
 Anna? 
 Yeah? 
 Your body doesn't want to wait for the medics. 
 It wants to have this baby right now. 
 So we're just gonna do what it tells us and listen to it, okay? 
 Oh, God! 
 That's good. That's good. 
 Hey, uh, Mr. Singh. Sorry. Can I have a minute? 
 Officer, we've been here two hours. 
 I'd like to take my daughter home. 
 I know. I'm really sorry. 
 The power outage has everything jammed up. 
 So we just... we just, uh, need you to fill out some child services forms at the front desk. 
 Child services? 
 Yeah, it's just a formality. 
 Whenever we bring in an unaccompanied minor, we have to report it. 
 Just right over there. They'll take care of you at the desk. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Thanks very much. Just a minute. 
 You want to sit down and wait for your Dad? 
 Okay? 
 Sorry it's so hot in here. 
 Dhara, my partner thinks she knows why you stole the ice cream truck. 
 I don't... know. I don't remember. 
 Well, she has this idea that maybe you were running away from something. 
 Dhara, did somebody try to hurt you? 
 There's another girl who might be in trouble, and I need to know what you know so I can help her. 
 Will you help me, please? 
 No. 
 Please? 
 If you tell him, he'll never let me outside alone again. 
 I won't tell him. I promise. 
 Dhara, did someone try to take you from the park? 
 A man? 
 Okay. Can you tell me what he looked like? 
 Yes. 
 Go. Keep going! Keep going! 
 You're doing great. 
 You're doing so awesome! This is amazing! Oh, my God. 
 It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're doing great. 
 Oh, my God. Okay, push! Push! 
 You're doing great! You're doing so awesome! 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! 
 One more. I see the shoulders! 
 Oh, my God. Take us home. Take us home. One more. 
 Okay, come here. Cut the cord. Cut the cord! 
 Gail, here... okay, it's good. It's here. Here it is. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Here we go. 
 You got him? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 He's so happy. 
 Hey, look, there's no sign of her down here, McNally. 
 It's time to get back to business, all right? 
 Meet me at the front entrance. 
 Okay. I'm just gonna take one more look on my way down. 
 All right. 
 Officer, what's, uh, what's going on? 
 You know your front door's busted? 
 I'm working. I've been fixing the A.C. all afternoon. 
 Yeah, it's not gonna work, not until the power's back up. 
 In the meantime, you might want to fix that door. 
 All right. 
 Did you hear that? 
 Yeah, let's open this up. 
 No problem. 
 McNally, you were right. Ice cream truck girl was running from the Rec Center over on Walnut. 
 Yeah, we're here right now. 
 The place was clear, but the front door was busted. 
 Yeah, that's how she got out. 
 Dhara said she was grabbed by an employee... big guy, brown hair. 
 She managed to fight him off and get away. 
 We're working on a name right now. 
 Hey, Aisha? It's the police. 
 Are you here? 
 Ah, came from there. What is that? 
 That's the basement. 
 Hey, you know what? You wait here. 
 I'll be back in just a minute. 
 What was that? 
 Gunshots. 
 Oh, God. 
 Officer Shaw. 
 Oliver! Oliver! 
 Dispatch, 1519. Officer down. 
 Where are you hit? 
 I took it in the vest. 
 Ohh! It hurts like hell! 
 I know. I know. Don't move. I'm gonna help you, okay? 
 He took my gun, and he's got the girl down there. 
 You gotta... you gotta go. 
 No, I'm not gonna leave you. 
 He just shot a cop. He is done. He's gonna kill her. Go. 
 McNally, be careful. 
 Oh, God. Okay. 
 Oh! Oh, God. 
 Okay. Shh. Don't say anything. Please, okay? 
 Just be quiet. 
 Police! Don't move! 
 Put your hands up! 
 Don't move! 
 Put your hands in the air. 
 Don't move! 
 It's all right. You're all right. You're okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Everything looks good, but because he's a month early, the medics would like to take you both to the hospital just to be safe. 
 I'll leave a message with your husband so he knows to meet you there as soon as he gets to town, okay? 
 Oh, no, no, no. I can't go. 
 Anna, your baby needs to go to the hospital. 
 You can stay here, but I really think you should be with him right now. 
 I'll tell you what... take my hand. 
 I'll go with you in the ambulance. 
 If you can't take it, just give me the look. 
 I'll have 'em shoot you up with so many sedatives, you won't know what's going on. 
 I mean, I might take some myself, too. 
 Okay. I'll go. 
 But I'm still not naming my baby after you, dov. 
 Okay, I can live with that. 
 Okay, I'll grab this. Baby! 
 And that's as much as you can remember? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, that's what happened, so, that's all. 
 Something else might come back to you once you have a little distance. 
 Uh, yeah, I guess. It's... 
 I just really don't think there's gonna be anything else. 
 We'll take care of the rest once the power's back and we can reach your union rep. 
 When can I get back to work? 
 As soon as the shooting's been officially cleared. 
 Seems pretty straightforward. 
 Thank you. 
 You were in there a while. 
 Your shift's been over an hour. 
 Yeah, who knew killing somebody required so much paperwork? 
 I'm so tired, I just... 
 I just want to curl up in my bed. 
 This case is big. 
 I.D.E.N.T.'S over at the Rec Center, and they already pulled up bone fragments from these two victims. 
 Could be more. And you got him. 
 Whole division's gonna know by tomorrow. 
 Yes, I guess they will. 
 I'm sure it'll mean more to you in the morning, once you've had a chance to get some sleep. 
 I'll give you a call, all right? Let you know what we find. 
 "We"? Are... are you on the case? 
 Not officially, but I offered to go over and help. 
 I was gonna go right away, but I wanted to see you first. 
 Now? 
 Okay. I mean, I... I guess I just thought that... 
 This case... is big. 
 You know, why don't I give you a ride home? 
 All right? Make sure you're okay? 
 That's okay. 
 No, really. It's only 15 minutes. It's not a big deal. 
 Luke, just go, okay? 
 I'm gonna be fine. I am so exhausted right now, I just want to go home and go to bed. 
 You sure? 
 I'm fine. 
 I'll call you first thing, let you know what we find. 
 Just got back from the hospital. 
 Shaw's already milking this for all it's worth. 
 Made me do a burger run. 
 How long is he gonna be in for? 
 A broken rib? Ah, he'll be out tomorrow. 
 Back on the job in a week. 
 God. 
 If he thought I was cursed before... 
 Are you kidding me? 
 He lost his gun. You... you got it back. 
 I'd say you're his guardian angel right about now. 
 Thanks. 
 How you doing? 
 Me? I'm... great. Totally fine. 
 Okay. 
 You killed someone today. 
 Well, I didn't really have a choice, so... 
 You wanna talk about it? 
 Not really. No. 
 Okay. 
 You change your mind, you call me. 
 Thanks. 
 Andy, you did everything right today. 
 You trusted your gut, and you were right. 
 Okay. All right. 
 I booked 62 people today. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 62. 
 And each one was a bigger jerk than the last. 
 But it all seems so insignificant next to delivering a baby. 
 Yeah, it was pretty great. 
 You know, I was pretty great today. 
 I was. 
 I bet you were. 
 Hey, listen. About this morning... 
 I don't know. I was, uh... 
 I was... I was tired. 
 And the last couple days, I've been feeling like I don't belong. 
 And I'm... I'm sorry. 
 You know, not everyone in this city is a selfish idiot. 
 Wait. What is that? 
 What is it? 
 You've gotta be kidding me. 
 Hey, is Dale here, guys? 
 Evening, officer. 
 Hey, man. What, uh, what's going on? 
 I had some stuff left over from a job, so... I just figured... 
 I hope that's cool. 
 Yeah, it's... it's cool. 
 It's... it's actually kind of perfect. 
 Right on. 
 You guys need a beer? 
 Sure. 
 You alone? 
 Yeah. 
 You wanna talk? 
 No. 
 Power's back on. 
 I guess that means everything's back to normal. 
 I should just turn a few things off. 
 Yeah, I guess everything goes back to normal.
