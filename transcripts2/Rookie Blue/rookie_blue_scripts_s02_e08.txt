 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Officers, sorry, beautiful evening. 
 Is it? Move. 
 Wow! 
 What? 
 Nothing Good. 
 Asile five. 
 You go long, I'll cut him off. 
 Okay Sir, you have a minute? 
 I don't work here. 
 I just want to talk to you. 
 Sorry, I can't.I'm in a bit of a rush. 
 5'8", athletic build, dark clothes, and a pretty funky skin condition. 
 I'm guessing you got a dye pack in the face, One of the many hazards of robbing a bank. 
 McNally? 
 Definitely matches the description we gave. 
 Watch it, watch it, watch... 
 You head across! We'll box him in! Watch that corner! 
 Stop! 
 Don't move! 
 Get your hands where I can see 'em, now! Get 'em up! 
 He's swallowing! 
 What did you swallow? 
 My pride. 
 Yeah. That's really hilarious. I am not in the mood. 
 No, really. 'Cause you're having a bad day. 
 I'm the one who's blue. 
 Rookie Blue Season 2 Episode 08 
Monster 
Original Air Date:  August 11, 2011 
 No, ma'am, we can't send another officer over. 
 Yeah, because we just sent one out an hour ago, and he didn't hear a single thing coming from your neighbor's party, so... 
 Which is exactly where I'm going after work, to crank music and annoy you, you bee-yotch. 
 Them's fighting words, if you're 9. 
 I just called an old lady a bee-yotch. 
 You not loving desk duty? 
 I love everything about this job... 
 Good. 
 But seriously? Desk duty three shifts in a row? 
 Shaw. 
 Yeah. 
 Blue guy in booking. 
 Blue guy? 
 Settle down, Diaz. Shift's almost over. 
 You know what? 
 My wife is sliding by in a bit to pick me up. 
 Flirt with her.Okay? It'll make her day. 
 Thanks. 
 It's Zoe, but you call her Mrs. Shaw. 
 Zoe, Mrs. Shaw. Okay. 
 Yeah. 15 Division. 
 Can you stop the car? 
 Can you stop the car, please? 
 Do I have barf on me? 
 You might want to wash your hair. 
 I really thought drunk guys puking on me would be over after high school. 
 Mr. Lee! 
 Easy, easy. He's having a rough night. 
 He's having a rough night. 
 We've got the smell of booze and barf in the back of our squad car. 
 Frank's gonna kill us. 
 Just as long as he doesn't make us stay late to clean it up, 'cause I got Leo in the morning, and I'm taking him for dim sum. 
 Don't talk about food right now. 
 Gail, when you are a mother, and God help that child, you are gonna realize a little puke is not such a big deal. 
 All right. Let's go. 
 Wakey, wakey -  one foot ln front of the other. Let's go. 
 You... there we go, here we go. You're gonna have a nice, long nap. 
 Aren't you just the mother of the fricking year? 
 That's it, then? Nothing else in your pockets? 
 That's all I got. 
 So, watch, belt, 40 bucks. 
 And 40 cents. 
 And what's left of my dignity. 
 You robbed a bank and pistol-whipped a manager. 
 We don't care about your dignity, blue guy. 
 Or your freedom...Braveheart. 
 Excuse us. Excuse us, clear the way. 
 That's disgusting! 
 You don't like the smell of barf? 
 We picked this guy up on Young Street. 
 He was kicking cars and screaming at pedestrians. 
 Yeah, well, he shouldn't be here. Should be at the hospital. 
 We didn't know how messed up he was until we got him in the car. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 Get his head. Get him on his side. 
 He's on his side, sir. 
 Good. Call an ambulance, Peck. 
 Dos cervezas. 
 Epstein. You off duty? 
 I swapped out my shift. 
 What, you got a big date? 
 You got a big date. Nice. She's cute. 
 She's, A.T.F. A bomb tech. We met while she was talking me off a bomb. 
 Well, hey, good strategy, dating someone outside the division. 
 That way, when it all goes to hell, you won't have to see her face every day. 
 Right. Good talk. 
 So, what do you want to do tonight? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, it's a lot of pressure. I hear you. 
 Well, there's a lot of people at work, waiting to hear how this hookup goes, so... 
 Really? 
 Well, uh, I was just thinking that we could hang out here until we go somewhere else, and then, when we go somewhere else, we could do... whatever? 
 Works for me. 
 Watch his head. 
 Yeah, thank you. I know what I'm d doing, Charlotte. 
 Yeah? Until you smash his skull into the seat back again. 
 That's nice, really. 
 Which one of you want to go along for a ride? 
 To the hospital? 
 To the observation deck of the C.N. Tower. 
 Yes, the hospital. You arrested him for public intoxication. 
 Just because he's under the weather, doesn't make his charge go away. 
 All right, I got to get up early in the morning. 
 I have upchuck in my hair. 
 You can wash it out at the hospital. 
 Evaluations are next month. 
 I'll do it. 
 Traci. 
 Martin. That's my wife, Charlotte. 
 Yeah, she's in the mood. 
 Peck, you smell. 
 You smell real bad. 
 Our system doesn't have any record of your fingerprints, and you got no I.D., so, uh... 
 Let's start with your name. 
 Grouchy Smurf. 
 I'm sure you're aware that yesterday, two men... wearing ski masks, robbed Broadway Mutual Bank at King and Church with a pistol, which, in turn, they used to beat Sunil Dhawan, branch manager, father of three. 
 Recognize him? 
 No. 
 You beat him so bad, he's still in the hospital. 
 Where's the money? 
 What money? 
 The money you stole from the bank. 
 What bank? 
 Really? 
 Come on. What did you swallow when we caught you? 
 Have no idea what you're talking about. 
 All right. 
 Here's an easy one. 
 Why are you blue? 
 I picked up a bad skin condition, or I like blueberries... a lot. 
 Or a security dye pack blew up in your face 45 seconds after you left the bank. 
 Well, that's a bit far-fetched, don't you think? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, if you think denying everything is gonna get you released, it's not. 
 Here's how it works. Tomorrow you go to court, then you go to jail. 
 In the meantime... 
 We can sit. 
 We can look at Sunil's photo. 
 And you. 
 We can look at big, blue you. 
 What do we do? 
 We wait till Jerry gets bored, runs out of steam, then we throw blue guy back in his cell, and, uh, start again tomorrow. 
 Here, you want some? 
 Jo's hand cream. 
 It's not Jo's. 
 Smells like Jo's. 
 Fine, it's Jo's. 
 It's really good hand cream. 
 She left it behind with three pens, hairbrush, and a burned CD. 
 You need to move on. 
 I have moved on. 
 You're snooping around in her desk. 
 You really want to move on? Get an ax, smash it to pieces. 
 No, 'cause I'm not angry anymore. I was angry last week. 
 Okay? I'm at bargaining now. 
 Which is why I thought that if I cleaned out her desk, then I would feel a lot better. 
 Well, do you? 
 No. 
 No, I don't, which makes me feel like I've maybe moved on to depression, with acceptance right around the corner. 
 You need an ax. 
 I got to get this. It's Traci. 
 Hey Trace. What's up? 
 Hypothetically speaking, if you were trying to prevent two newly married people from murdering each other, would you use your Baton, or go straight for your gun? 
 Followed my instructions, guy'd be in triage by now, instead of emergency. 
 Mood I'm in, I'd use both. 
 I thought you weren't angry anymore. 
 Of course I'm angry, but I'm working on it. 
 You know, I used to actually love coming to work. 
 You know? I used to feel safe here. 
 Just because we're married, doesn't give you free license to be mean. 
 I'm sorry you got turned down for med school again. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm in hell. 
 They stuck me in a room with the Bickersons, told us all to wait. 
 You're still at the hospital? 
 We brought the guy in, they took him off to emergency, and now they won't let us go anywhere. 
 What the hell is going on? Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Traci? 
 What's going on? 
 Sir, I just got off the phone with Traci. 
 She seems a little stressed out. 
 What's happening? 
 Nobody leaves. Nobody comes in until further notice. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 As of now, this division's under quarantine. 
 Gail Peck, my personal hero. 
 Why? 'Cause I screwed up everyone's night? 
 Well, my wife did have concert tickets, front row, center, which is not the kind of place you want to be when you're a 30-something, and the concert happens to be Taylor Swift. Best excuse ever. 
 Tell me about it. I don't have to host book club. 
 I hate book club. I'm so q quiting book club. 
 All right, everyone, let's get this going. 
 Everyone, this is Barb from public health. 
 Hey Barb. 
 Hi everybody. 
 Basically, Henry Lee is sick. They don't know why. 
 And since everyone from the division has been exposed to whatever it is he has, Barb wants to make sure we don't spread it. 
 And it's just a precaution. There's no reason to panic. It's all procedure. 
 We're working really hard to figure this out, so with any luck, you should be out of here soon. 
 And, yes, you all will be paid your overtime rates for the duration of the quarantine, just like last time. 
 Any other questions? 
 Yeah. When's the pizza get here? 
 Who's got the cards? 
 Right here. 
 Who's calling my book club? 
 Everybody loves a snow day. 
 Is it contagious? 
 We're not sure yet. 
 I brought him in. He barfed on my head. 
 Am I gonna get sick? I mean, do you even know what he's got? 
 As soon as the disease is defined, Barb here will start you on any appropriate medication, if you need it. 
 In the meantime, uh, Diaz, I need you directing all calls to the nearest division. 
 Williams, with me. 
 I have to phone the next shift, have 'em report to 27. 
 So you want me to take half the list? 
 Nope. Just like having you around. 
 It's like we're having a... we're having a spa day. 
 I'm on the puck, buddy. 
 Well, this isn't, uh, this isn't like my ball, my call." 
 Don't be such a baby, buddy. 
 Awfully eager for the fish that always loses. 
 Luck runs in streaks, and mine is about to change. 
 Yeah. 
 Where's Sammy? I need to make some money. 
 "Where's Sammy? I need to make some money." 
 So I thought, uh, before I settle in and take everybody's money, why don't we, uh, see if the threat of imminent death gets blue guy talking? 
 I thought there was nothing to worry about. 
 Blue guy doesn't know that. 
 Okay, wait. There really is nothing to worry about, right? 
 We got quarantined for S.A.R.S. in '03. You know what happened? 
 Snack machine ran dry, Jerry started growing himself a goatee, and I took everybody's money in poker. 
 If Frank says don't worry, don't worry. 
 Okay, but what if it is something? 
 Then worry. 
 Quarantine, huh? 
 That old Chestnut. 
 The guy you saw collapse earlier is in the hospital, he's sick, and he's contagious. 
 Well, if we're in such grave danger, why isn't she crying? 
 You should be hysterical, right? 
 Calling your boyfriend, saying good-bye to mom and Dad... 
 Do I look like I'm suppressing emotion? 
 Is that the problem here? 
 Maybe that's because, uh, well, my fiancee just slept with his ex, I haven't seen my mother in years, my father is six months off the bottle, and three weeks ago, I almost died in a storage locker. 
 So please... This quarantine thing? Piece of cake. 
 I like her. She got spunk. 
 Yeah, can I punch him in the face? 
 And fire, lots of fire. 
 Just tell us where your partner is. 
 Just tell me what time it is. 
 You first. 
 Can't do it. 
 Okay. 
 Protect your buddy.Let him spend your cut while you die alone in jail. 
 I'm done here. 
 McNally, take his dinner order. 
 Those who haven't put their orders in should talk to Chris at reception. 
 What do you want? 
 Your fiancee slept with his ex? 
 What do you want? 
 Come on. Seriously, what time is it? 
 Fine, I'm gonna order for you. 
 I'm more than happy to split it. 
 You saved my life. 
 Good point. 
 Did you get the message? 
 What? 
 15's on lockdown. 
 What's the code? 
 It's not a bomb. It's a quarantine. I'm heading over now. 
 They're not gonna let you inside. 
 Well, we can sit here and do nothing, or we can go over and see if we can help. 
 Luke, Sue. Sue, Luke. 
 How much have you had to drink? I'll drive. 
 You sure you're all right with this? 
 Near death, yellow tape... 
 You and me, it's becoming a thing for us. 
 Okay, what... what about S.A.R.S.? 
 "Flu-like symptoms, sudden onset of high fever, chills, shivering...". 
 It... it doesn't explain the seizures, though. 
 So S.A.R.S. is out. Any other diseases you want her to check? 
 Shivering, nausea, difficulty breathing... 
 Try plague. 
 Plague? 
 Yes, plague... bubonic, pneumonic, cepticemic... 
 Okay, uh, "plague." 
 "Symptoms include chills..." check, "fever..." check, "seizures..." double check, and swollen lymph nodes"? 
 Did his nodes look swollen to you? 
 I wasn't looking at his nodes. 
 What about smallpox? 
 Please. They eradicated smallpox. 
 Did they? 
 Because there's two labs in the world that still have it... Russia and Atlanta. 
 If you knew that, maybe they would have let you into medical school. 
 "Smallpox." I'm feeling lucky. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Why didn't you let me take him to the hospital? 
 You didn't want to go to the hospital. You wanted to wash your hair. 
 This is so not my fault, Traci. 
 It's nobody's fault. The guy was sick, and we didn't know. 
 Well, you should have known. 
 You're-- you're a mom, and kids are like little petri dishes of diseases. 
 I'm hanging up now! 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Would you still date me if I looked like this? 
 Yeah, probably. 
 No, not you, sir. 
 Who's calling in dinner? I got blue guy's order. 
 J-just hold on, sir. 
 So is he looking Navy blue or sky blue? 
 You haven't seen him? 
 No, I've been stuck here all night. 
 Really? 
 You want to put Chris in holding? 
 Yeah. 
 Have you ever been undercover? 
 Yeah. You remember? 
 I, you know, I was, uh, the... the gay... 
 The prostitute. 
 Yeah. That's right. 
 White pants. 
 Well, uh, we appreciate the initiative, but... 
 You know what? I'm folding anyway. We got nothing to lose. 
 McNally, you ready to prep him? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay, so blue guy really screwed up, you know? He got caught. 
 He's blue, obviously, and, uh, he's feeling a bit embarrassed, so just make him like you, you know? 
 Pretty likeable guy. 
 Swoosh this like it's mouthwash. 
 Good idea. That way, blue guy'll think you pulled me in for being drunk. 
 Okay, there's three things we're looking for. 
 Chris. 
 Name... his partner's name... and his motive. 
 Also, uh, he keeps asking what time it is, so we think that maybe his accomplice has another plan. 
 That's why we have to get to him now. 
 You can swallow now. 
 Okay. 
 Burns. 
 Yeah. Cuff him. 
 What's up. 
 Chris Diaz. Nice to meet ya. 
 Got a little somethin' there. Cool. 
 What, are you kidding me? 
 What? 
 So you worried about this quarantine thing? 
 Know anything about it? 
 No offense, man, but you look like you're in pretty rough shape. 
 Must hurt or, you know, itch. 
 I don't know if you've seen yourself lately, but you have blue all over, all over your face and your hands. 
 It's kind of like that fake suntan stuff. 
 You picked a real chameleon, McNally. 
 He's just charming him. He's warming him up. 
 Sam, you're missing a real donk-fest over here, pal. 
 You know, I'm just... I'm just getting loose here. 
 Yeah? Just flopping a set of Jacks, right under the gun. 
 You lead out? 
 'Course. Then I filled it up on the turn. 
 Barber here... sorry, buddy... pushes all in, last week's paycheck. 
 Okay, you know what? Do me a favor. Call, or shut your mouth. 
 Looks like someone's getting run over by the deck again. 
 Yeah, well, if you ask me, leading out's a bit amateur. 
 They were my cards, I would have checked-raise, smooth call, and taken the lead on the turn. 
 Callaghan. 
 Buddy, what's going on in there? Is everybody okay? 
 Yeah, real good. I just flopped a nut flush. 
 You are never gonna guess who I just took to the bank. 
 Jerry followed you all the way to the river. 
 Yeah. You know? We're fine. Go home. 
 Like a "B" movie out here. 
 We got ambulances, people in masks, it's- that's out of our control. 
 That's why we're playing poker. 
 How's Andy? 
 Great. 
 She's, uh, working a case with Swarek. 
 Just, uh... Just... 
 You know, just tell her I said hi. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 They're testing for all the hemorrhagic fevers. 
 It's not ebola, marburg, rift valley. It's not hantavirus. 
 They're gonna call as soon as they know anything. 
 I know Andy's in there, but there's nothing we can do from out here, so can we drive you home? 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 "Steak frites is a revelation... tender Angus beef adorned with tiny matchstick fries." 
 Okay, Frank... 
 Reservations. 
 We have dinner together every Friday. 
 A-at first, uh, we went Dutch, and we had a burger, but after that it got fancy. 
 You... you started paying. 
 You have a problem with me buying you dinner? 
 No, it's great. It's wonderful. I could eat steak every Friday. 
 I could eat steak every Friday with you. 
 It's just... 
 Pizza? 
 That's great. I'm actually starving. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you get any pizza? 
 I'm not eating. 
 My stomach is killing me, and I'm sweating, and my nodes are swollen. 
 Your nodes are swollen? 
 Or you could be freaking yourself out. 
 What do you know? 
 I worked S.A.R.S., swine flu, bird flu. 
 I spent more time calming people down than I did treating people who were sick. 
 You need to eat something. 
 Okay, fine, but if I'm patient zero, shouldn't I be isolating myself? 
 If it gets worse, we'll deal with it then. 
 Eat. 
 Okay. 
 What time is it? 
 All right. Meat lovers for the blue guy. 
 Hawaiian for the hustler. 
 Thanks. 
 You're a prostitute? 
 Don't judge me. 
 Yeah, 'cause I'm in a real position to mock. 
 All right. Enjoy your dinner. 
 Come on. Just tell me what time it is. 
 Tell me your name, I'll tell you what time it is. 
 Yeah. I didn't think so. 
 You robbed a bank. 
 You like pineapple on your pizza? 
 How much money you get? 
 How much money you get? 
 Why are you blue? 
 God help me, is this what it's gonna be like in jail? 
 I couldn't tell ya. I've only been there once. Couple weeks for possession. 
 Tell me something, if I kill you right now, you think I'll get a room to myself? 
 If I robbed a bank, the first thing I'd buy is a dog. 
 Then a Harley. 
 Then I'd probably move down to California and get one of those trailer things by the beach, you know, and a surfboard, wet suit... a couple of 'em. 
 I think I'd look pretty good in one of those. 
 Would you please shut up?! 
 I'm just saying, man, that's what I'd do lf I stole a whole whack of cash. 
 Well, hey, I didn't steal anything, allright?! 
 Bank took something from me. 
 I just took it back. 
 Okay. My deal. 
 You know the guy that was beat up... he a branch manager? 
 Yeah, he is. 
 So he's reeonsible for mortgages, loans? 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe he was targeted. 
 I mean, maybe this guy has a beef with his neighborhood branch. 
 Did blue guy say somethin'? 
 Yeah, Chris just got him talking. He said he didn't steal anything. 
 He just took it back. 
 Is the branch manager still at Victoria Mercy? 
 Yeah, as far as I know. 
 Who are you calling? 
 27 Division. They might as well head over there with blue guy's mug shot, see if they can get an I.D. 
 No! Hang up. Hang it up! Hang it up! 
 What, what, what, what?! 
 Just... listen. We're on quarantine, right, and as far as we know, this might be our last case, so do we really want to give it up? 
 I played hockey against those guys last season. 
 Bunch of cheatin' bitches at 27. 
 All right, so then who's out there that's on our team? 
 Callaghan...And, uh I think he's with Dov. 
 Luke, huh? 
 Well, might as well, uh, give him a call. 
 Callaghan. 
 We have a lead, uh, on the Broadway Mutual Bank robbery. 
 Andy? 
 Yeah, um, listen, I'm gonna e-mail you guys over a mug shot. 
 I need you to go over there and get an I.D. from the branch manager. 
 Is the quarantine over? 
 What's going on? Are you guys okay? 
 The branch manager's at Victoria Mercy. 
 We think he might know the suspect. 
 You got all that? 
 Yeah. Broadway Mutual Bank. Suspect I.D. I'll call you if we get anything. 
 Okay. Good. 
 Andy. I miss you. 
 Yep.Yeah, okay. 
 How'd that go for ya? 
 Henry Lee is not responding to any of the medication that they're giving him. 
 So what if I have what he has? 
 I gotta call Leo. I have to. 
 No, no, no, no, no. No. You don't want to wake him up ln the middle of the night and scare him to death over something that's probably, look, nothing's gonna happen. 
 You're right. You're right. You're right. 
 Okay, well, is there any other news on this Henry Lee guy? 
 27 sent a car over to the guy's house. 
 He's got no friends. No Friday night at the neighbors'. No next of kin. 
 Did you track down any co-workers? 
 Game, set, match! Shaw! 
 I knew it! 
 Okay, wait. Hold on. 
 You donkey! You spiked the king! 
 No the guy works 9:00 to 5:00 skimming ponds at the filtration plant alone. 
 See, that's the thing. Nobody knows anything about this guy. 
 You're telling me this poor guy's entire life was spent wading through pond scum? 
 That just opens up a whole new world of biochemical horror. 
 Jerry, if anything happens to me... 
 Nothing is gonna happen to you. 
 I just wish I was there with you. 
 Hang on a second. The doctor's back. 
 How long ago? 
 Just now. 
 What is he saying? 
 Still don't know what it is? 
 No. We're still running tests. 
 Traci, what's happening? 
 Henry Lee... 
 He just died. 
 What, 40-ounce flu? 
 Henry Lee died. 
 When? 
 About 20 minutes ago. 
 The good news is, we can do an autopsy now, start figuring this thing out. 
 I think that makes us all feel a lot better, Barb. 
 Well, what did he die of? What did he have? 
 We don't know yet. I'm sorry. 
 I know this must be very stressful, but until we know what it is, I'm afraid no one's going anywhere. 
 Now, listen, Peck has been in primary contact with the victim. 
 Until further notice, she's staying in my office, not to be disturbed. 
 My team is gonna be setting up over there. 
 We want to start taking temperatures, blood pressure. 
 We just want to monitor what's happening. 
 I'm gonna hit the snack machine before Oliver empties it. Do you want anything? 
 No. 
 No? You sure? 
 Yeah Okay. 
 You know, if that guy had just come in an hour later, I would've been at the Taylor Swift concert... teasing my wife about her middle-aged lady dancing. 
 Yeah, well, I would've been at book club dissecting Jonathan Franzen. 
 Come on, sweetie. Answer the phone. 
 You're not calling anybody? 
 My parents are asleep. So's my sister. 
 Guess I should get checked out. 
 What if we're sick? 
 Then we're sick. 
 Okay, try your wife again. 
 No, she's not answering. 
 Third time's a charm. 
 Hey. 
 Hi darlin'. 
 It's good to hear your voice. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 So maybe I should take this one? 
 I got it, Epstein. 
 No, I-I know you do, but you've had a couple, so... 
 I'm fine. Andy asked me to do this, so I'm gonna do it. 
 Okay. 
 Sorry. 
 Nobody's exploded. For me, that's a pretty good night. 
 Mr. Dhawan, I'm sorry to wake you. 
 It's okay. What do you need? 
 I'm Detective Luke Callaghan from 15 Division. 
 We believe we may have one of the men in custody who robbed your bank yesterday. 
 That's great, but I already told you guys, I didn't see their faces. They had masks on. 
 Right, but they took them off when they went outside, which is when the dye pack went off. 
 We have a photo. Epstein? 
 This guy's a client. 
 We foreclosed on his mortgage three months ago. 
 He lost his job. He couldn't make his payments. 
 Was he angry? 
 We took his house away. 
 It was bank policy. I told him that. 
 What was his name? 
 Mitchell. 
 James Mitchell. 
 You think I like waking up every morning next to a woman who doesn't respect me? 
 Maybe I'd respect you more if you supported me more. 
 Well, maybe I'd support you more if you were nicer to me, if I wasn't the source of every problem you've ever had. 
 Shut up! I'm scared, all right? 
 And all I can hear is you two screaming at each other, hating each other, when right now I would give anything to be with the people that I love! 
 Sorry. We're sorry, Traci. 
 My son is 7 years old and he's asleep, and I can't call him. 
 Maybe you could write him a letter. 
 You know, it might make you feel better. 
 Or you could make him a video. 
 All right. Ready when you are. 
 It's not a good-bye. 
 Okay. You're right. It's not a good-bye. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 We're rolling. 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 I'm at work right now, and I don't know why, but I keep thinking... you know how when it's raining and, um, you're stuck inside, and I won't let you watch TV, but, um, I always tell you that you have to make something, and you do, and it's fantastic, because you have made a car out of a box or a bus out of a box or a rockekeship out of a box? 
 Well, here's a little secret. 
 I love the rain. 
 I can't wait for the rain, because then I can be ready with a cardboard box, because that is my favorite thing to watch you do. 
 I love you so much, my darling. 
 I do. 
 That okay? 
 Yeah. 
 It was great. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just trying to put the pieces together... James. 
 Or do you prefer "Jim" or "Jimmy"? 
 'Cause we got a branch manager who just I.D.'d you as James Mitchell, but whatever you wanna go by. 
 Personally I kinda like, uh, blue guy. 
 What else do we know about you? 
 You're married for eight years. 
 You and your wife Julie just got evicted from your house, and pretty much all you have in the world ls, uh, one belt, one watch... 
 $40 and, uh, 40 cents. 
 Wait. Where's his ring? 
 What ring? 
 Well, there's a line around his finger where a ring used to be. 
 I mean, I tried talking to him about his wife, but he wouldn't say anything. 
 Hey, uh, can I talk to you for a second? 
 Excuse me, blue guy. I'll be right back. 
 What is it? 
 So if you look at his hand, you can tell that he was wearing a wedding ring when the dye pack explpled. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It's not in his bag. 
 Yeah, remember when we arrested him, he swallowed something? 
 Guess he didn't want us to know about his marriage. 
 No wonder he's protecting his partner. 
 Because his partner  is  his partner. 
 His wife. 
 We think Mitchell's partner on the bank job was his wife. 
 Yeah, her name's Julie, she's 42, no kids. 
 Okay, where is she now? 
 Well, looking at Mitchell's credit card statements. 
 They were staying at a Super 8 Motel just outside the city for almost two months, and the credit ran out four days ago. 
 So let's think this through. 
 Who's that? 
 That's Sue from bomb squad. Dov's on a date. 
 Okay, you're my husband. 
 Okay. 
 We rob a bank. Dye pack goes off. I'm blue. Maybe you're blue. 
 Well, at least we're blue together. I mean, that's good. 
 But we still have to hide. 
 'Cause the fuzz is on our tail. 
 Right. Five-o. Can't shake 'em. 
 So where do we go? 
 Well, we can't go back to the motel. 
 No, and can't call our friends. I mean, why risk it? 
 Give me that. 
 The, uh, the drugstore where you picked him up... 
 Was it anywhere around his house? 
 Yeah, same area. What, like, four blocks away? 
 That's it then. 
 Our house. Our foreclosed house. 
 Nobodydy in it. It's perfect. 
 So would you and I go home? 
 Andy, you got an address? 
 339 Cowan. 
 All right. Call 27 Division. Get 'em to meet us there with a couple of units. 
 I will do that. Will do. 
 What a night, huh? 
 Tell me about it. 
 I want to have a baby. 
 Excuse me? 
 It's... it's not just that I want to have one, I'm actually trying... have been trying. 
 That's why I work so much overtime. Saving up for I.V.F. 
 And I'm gonna do one last round, and, you know, since we started having dinner t... 
 Okay, I don't know where I'm going with this. 
 Anyway, I just wanted you to know, before we... have any more dinners. 
 Okay. 
 Okay...What? 
 Frank, what are we doing here? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay. 
 Noelle. W-wait! 
 Don't. 
 No. I-I might have infected everybody, and I don't want to get you sick... especially not you. 
 Gail, open the door. 
 No. 
 Gail. 
 No! 
 Open the door. 
 Chris, seriously... no. 
 Come here. 
 I don't want to get you sick. 
 Why? 
 Because then you're gonna get infected... 
 Gail, Shut up. and then you'll have a disease, and then you're gonna die. 
 Let's just say we did some police work, and we found out where your partner is who your partner is... Julie, your wife. 
 You keep guessing. 
 No, you know what? We're done guessing. 
 We've got units on their way over to your old house right now, and they need to know what they're walking into. 
 You robbed a bank with a gun, and if you don't have it, your wife does. 
 If she makes a move to use it, they're gonna shoot her. 
 That's how it works, so you'd better start talking... now. 
 The gun was fake. 
 You told us nothing all night. Why would we believe that? 
 We didn't use a real gun. 
 We didn't want to hurt anybody. 
 Yeah, especially the branch manager. 
 Wasn't supposed to happen that way. 
 We were supposed to go in, we were supposed to get the money and get out. 
 I just wish he hadn't been there. 
 I wish I hadn't seen him, but I did. I saw him, and I just... I lost it. 
 You put him in the hospital. 
 He put us on the street. 
 We had a house... jobs... a life... 
 And then within a month, we both got laid off. That was a year ago. 
 Yeah, what a year. 
 We asked the bank to help. We asked him. We begged him. 
 "Please give us a break. Give us... just give us a little more time." Nope. Nope, nope, nope. 
 Do you have any idea what it's like to lose everything? 
 You don't exist. 
 Nobody cares. 
 Please don't hurt her. 
 She's it. 
 She's all I got. 
 So should I take you home now? 
 Yeah, I guess you should, 'cause, you know, this is really boring. 
 All right. Let's do this. Name's Julie Mitchell, 42, brunette. 
 She may be armed, so let's look sharp. 
 Back's already covered, so we're going in the front door. 
 We'll clear the main floor before working our way up. Any questions? 
 No, sir. 
 Dov, you wanna take this? 
 Are you serious? 
 Just don't make me look bad. 
 Main floor's clear. 
 Julie Mitchell? Hands in the air where I can see 'em. Now. 
 Looks like you're going somewhere. 
 I was supposed to leave if he wasn't back by sunrise. 
 I was supposed to get away. 
 Where was I gonna go? 
 This house is the whole reason we took the money. It's everything we had. 
 Couldn't leave it. Couldn't leave him. 
 Suspect in custody. 
 Copy that. 
 H-hello? 
 Really? 
 Okay yeah. Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Charlotte? 
 It's not contagious. 
 What? 
 We're getting out of here. 
 Dex, hey. I'm sorry. I know that it's early, but, um, when Leo wakes up, can you please tell him that I am coming to pick him up for breakfast? 
 Yes, everything is fine. 
 Henry Lee cleaned the ponds at the filtration plant. 
 Somehow he contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. 
 What is that? 
 It's an amoeba you get from warm water. 
 And it's not contagious. 
 It's not at all contagious. Everybody can go home. 
 But I'll see you in a while. 
 I'll see you tomorrow, brother. 
 Yes, so will I. 
 That was a long day. 
 I shouldn't be laughing. 
 Listen, uh, I'm thinking about going to the Black Penny for breakfast. You in? 
 I can't, but, uh, I have something you need to do right now. Come here. 
 Got someone here to see you, James. 
 You're safe. 
 You okay? Yeah? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Me, too.

♪ now we can both be on our way ♪

 Too bad Dov's not here for the lockdown. Wonder how his date went. 
 It's Dov. 
 Yeah, you're right. Poor Dov. 
 We're having breakfast together. 
 I-I don't actually... I don't always do that on a first date. 
 Well, it wasn't exactly how I planneded, but... 
 Yeah, but that's why I had so much fun what are we doing? 
 You need to hit something. 
 Hit what? 
 Me. 
 I'm okay. Thank you. 
 Okay. Don't do that. 
 Your turn. 
 Nice. 
 That's what you want? 
 All right. 
 Come and get 'em. 
 Is that the best you got?
