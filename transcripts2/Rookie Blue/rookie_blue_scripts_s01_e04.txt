 Three bedrooms, two baths. 
 Landscape backyard. A little gazebo-thing. 
 It's beautiful. 
 On sale, half price. 
 Double homicide will do that to your property value. 
 Uh. You see even this is more interesting, than that movie. 
 C'mon. 
 Yeah. Okay. You're right. 
 You can pick next time. 
 So what happened in there? I mean 2 houses down here, I had no idea. 
 It's pretty straightforward. He was home, and found his wife in bed with someone else. 
 Ooh, crime of passion, huh? 
 Love... I'd be out of work without it. 
 So, what, did the guy just confess? 
 Well, no, not right away. 
 Took a little more convincing than that. 
 I just told him he'd feel a lot better if he let it all out. 
 Seemed kind of relieved when he told me. They usually are. 
 Strangely like being a therapist. 
 And here I thought homicide was all sunglasses and shiny suits, writing on glass, walking on water... 
 (Chuckles) 
 You're something else, you know that? 
 You have no idea how amazing you are. 
 (Holiday parade) ♪ everybody longs for something, I ♪ 
♪ I'd give it all again to feel el it ♪ 
 You cold? 
 (Dog barking in distance) 
 No. 
 I'm perfect. 
 (Traci) Homicide loot's got some smooth moves. 
 (Andy) No, it was perfect... 
 I mean, the whole date. 
 Romantic and honest and... 
 Actually, a little bit weird for me. 
 You know what's weird? 
 Is you guys making out in front of a murder house. 
 (Chuckles) Would it ever strike you that Luke's a little obsessed with death? 
 Well, he's a homicide Detective. It's sort of his job. 
 I'm just saying he's not perfect, which is good because perfect is boring. 
 Yeah, perfect would really suck. 
 Ew. (Engine sputters) 
 Ugh. 
 (Horn honks in distance) 
 (Andy) Afternoon, boys. 
 You all set? 
 Oh, yeah. Major undercover op. 
 This shift is gonna rock. 
 Hanging on a little tight there, Dov. 
 I don't think a John sweep qualifies as an op." 
 Is it an operation? Yes, it is. 
 Will we be dressed in uniform? No, we will not. We will be... 
 Dressed as hookers. 
 Yeah, I know it's no big deal to you. 
 You're used to being dressed like a hooker, but to me... (Laughs) 
 Okay, whose cologne is making my eyes water? 
 (Sniffs) 
 ♪ I'd give it all again to feel it ♪ 
 You guys are here... and here. 
 Cover team is here. 
 Backup here, here... and here. 
 You will not be wired, but you will have earpieces so we can talk you through. 
 Peck, run the drill. 
 Well, we need the John to offer money for a sex-related act, and then he is arrestable, so we give the signal, cover team moves in and makes the collar. 
 Good. 
 Do not let anyone touch you. 
 Do not get in any vehicle. 
 Do not go anywhere your cover team can't see you. 
 And no matter what happens, you stick to your story. 
 Eh, you're drug addicts. You're supporting a habit. It's nothing fancy. 
 All right. You guys are the fresh faces. That's why you're out there, so... this one's all on you. 
 Yes, sir. Good. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Too much? 
 Uh, too little. 
 (Scoffs) Please. You're the one who brought in the porno boots. 
 Would you shut up? 
 (Laughs) (Knock on door) 
 Nash, uh, got a request from the DA's office. 
 They want a rook to help with a murder investigation. 
 Murder, sir? 
 Yeah. Kempton University student got sliced up in High Park last night. 
 Be a good opportunity to see a homicide case close-up. 
 And you want me? 
 O... or you, McNally. Uh, you're welcome to opt out and work with Callaghan, if you want. 
 Uh... all yours. 
 Right. Then you should, uh, check in with Callaghan and, uh, tell him to wait up. 
 Wait up? Why? Where am I going? 
 The morgue. 
 Ugh. 
 Oh. Um... here. 
 Thanks. 
 You, uh, always take this long figuring out what to wear? 
 (Scoffs) You always hang around women's locker rooms? 
 Hey, you started it. 
 (Door squeaks) 
 Oh, who's this? 
 None of your business. 
 Right. 
 (Clears throat) 
 Magnetic, huh? 
 That's cool. Good idea. 
 Sir. 
 You're ready for this, right? 
 For what? 
 Tonight. 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 Good. 
 I like the leopard print one. 
 Oh, good. Good, 'cause I'm wearing the green one. 
 Good. 
 Just go wherever you want, and you do that, eh? Go. 
 Is... uh, is this the... about the cologne? 
 Uh... 'cause I... I think there might be some sort of confusion. 
 Look, I'd do anything, sir. 
 You know that. 
 But if you want me to be, uh... you know. 
 Hey, what's to know? Diaz, you're a hustler looking for some action. 
 Yeah, but... 
 (Lowers voice) but, like, a gay hustler? 
 You got a problem with that? 
 Well... no, it's just... well, it's just I don't... I don't think anyone's gonna buy it. 
 You know... 
 I'm actually very, very straight. 
 Learn to bend. 
 Uh, I bend. Not literally, but I would if it meant bringing in the bad guys. 
 Sorry, Epstein. You're on the "N" case. 
 The "N" case? 
 Yeah, you sit in your squad... on the radio. 
 You pay attention N-case we need you. 
 (Laughs) 
 You know, Dov's right. 
 He's actually much more believable a... as a gay dude. 
 Yeah, it... it's true. I shave my chest. 
 Hey, McNally. 
 (Andy) Yeah? 
 Come here. 
 (Oliver) Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Settle something. Who's gonna make a better rentboy... 
 Epstein or Diaz? 
 Uh... well, um... I'm not a guy, but... 
 Simple question, McNally. 
 Yeah. Chris, definitely. 
 (Oliver) Settled. 
 All right, Epstein, you're backup. 
 Diaz, you're the decoy boy. 
 (Oliver) Work it. 
 (Sighs) Those boots are ridiculous. 
 You know we're supposed to be low-rent prostitutes, right? 
 Yeah, well, they're not exactly high-end. 
 And who's gonna pay to have s*x with you looking like that? 
 (Scoffs) You'd be surprised. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Swarek) All right. Can you hear me? 
 Do you remember the signal? 
 Good. Now we got backup surrounding you, okay? 
 Jay, can you hear me? 
 (Siren wailing in distance) 
 Okay. Anything goes wrong, we're here. Got it?

 (frank) Looking good, Diaz. (Laughs) 
 (Noelle) No kiddin'. Check out his mameltoe." (Laughs) 
 (Laughs) Uh, there's a lump in your pants, lady. 
 (Both laughs) 
 Now that's just not nice. 
 Now look... look at that stud. That's all man. (Laughing) 
 (Laughing) Oh, yeah. Boys are gonna go crazy. 
 It's days like this I love my job. 
 I hear ya. 
 This? 
 Damn, I'd come in for free. 
 What is he doing? 
 Four stab wounds, some obvious defense wounds. 
 Looks like a 6-to 8-inch blade. 
 Those always make a mess. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Only one weapon, no other marks or bruising, so we're probably just looking for one guy. 
 Um, it says here, "no I.D. No wallet." 
 So... what? A mugging? 
 Well, could be. We'll know more once we I.D. the body. 
 Looks to be in his early 20s. Student, probably. 
 Wearing a Kempton University jacket... engineering department. 
 Good enough place to start. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I... I think, uh, maybe it was just the smell in the morgue. 
 Just formaldehyde, blood. (Laughs) 
 It's funny. I don't even smell it anymore. 
 Hmm. 
 You wanna pin these up? 
 Sure.

 Dispatch, 1505 still standing by, corner of Gerrard and Pembroke. 
 Woman : Uh, thank you once again, 1505. 
 Still have your position. Same as it was two minutes ago. 
 Just making sure. 
 (Hangs up receiver) 
 (Sighs) 
 Dispatch, this is 1505 again. 
 I'm witnessing a suspicious-looking male... 
 Caucasian, approximately 25 years of age. 
 He appears to be... picking the lock of a residence. 
 I'm gonna take a closer look. 
 (Seat belt clicks) (Woman) 10-4. 
 (Siren wailing) 
 Oh, sorry. (Laughs) 
 Disregard. Disregard. 
 False alarm. 
 His key was just stuck. 
 Looks like he might actually live there. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Woman : Copy, 1505.. 
 Man, what is with that kid? 
 Just trying to help. 
 Tell me we were never that stupid. 
 We were never that stupid. 
 Thank you, brother. 
 Man : Let's clear this channel. 
 Man : ♪ money must be funny in a rich man's world ♪ 
♪ I might crack a smile when the bottle froze ♪ 
♪ it's still one for the money, two for the show ♪ 
 For 50 bucks, I'd do just about anything. 
 (Oliver) Takedown. 
 Man : Come on. Get in the car. 
 Peck, good work. 
 All right, Jay. He's all yours, buddy. 
 That sounds pretty good. 
 (Jay) Good evening, sir. I'm a police officer. 
 You understand me? 
 No way. 
 ♪ 
 (beep) 
 (Beep) 
 (Beep) 
 Any luck? 
 Uh, gone through the last four yearbooks. 
 No joy. Maybe he was a part-time student. 
 No one at the university recognized his photo? 
 Unh-unh. 
 Not a single engineering prof, and no one in the engineering club. 
 Time of death is about 11:30. 
 He was probably taking a shortcut through the park on his way home. 
 Let's narrow it down to students with addresses within a 4-block radius of the park. 
 Meantime, why don't you organize these autopsy photos so we can keep everything straight? 
 I'm like a chef. I like to clean as I go. 
 Sir. 
 Mm? 
 Please, I... I... I'd be happy to work on the addresses. 
 Anything... anything that doesn't involve more photos. 
 Traci, you're a cop. You're gonna see dead bodies. 
 I know. It's... it's just... 
 Okay. 
 You know, I've never seen this as a particularly positive thing, but apparently men are more visual. 
 Okay... 
 Male investigators... we need more pictures to put it all together. 
 And what about women? 
 They tend to focus more on the story. 
 What does the evidence say about the victim? 
 Who was he? What happened? What doesn't add up? 
 Neither one's better, just different. 
 McNally, you're being eyeballed again. 
 Black pickup coming from the south. 
 Third time around for him. Get ready. 
 (Whirs) 
 (Whispers) Hey. Haven't seen you before. 
 (Normal voice) Yeah, well, I'm new. 
 Yeah, you're new. (Scoffs) 
 I like dogs. 
 What? 
 I like dogs. 
 Your face. (Laughs) You're not my type. 
 Get lost. 
 Are you looking for somethin', honey? 
 "Honey"? 
 (Laughs) 
 You're a dog. You don't even know it. 
 Come here, little doggy. 
 Daddy'll give you a treat. 
 You afraid you can't take it? 
 Get in. 
 No, I just... 
 Got the signal. Jay, move in. 
 Get in. 
 Yeah, I... not interested. Thanks. 
 Not interested? 
 Disregard. 
 McNally, what's... what's going on? 
 Bitch! 
 White male eyeing you. Mid 40s. Blue shirt. Beige slacks. 
 (Horns honking) 
 Look alive, Diaz. He's coming over. 
 Great. Awesome. 
 Is $20 enough? 
 Maybe. Maybe not. What do you want? 
 Somewhere more private, all right? 
 Back there, maybe. 
 Diaz, what's going on? Give me the signal. 
 Well, how about $40? 
 Or $60? I'll give you whatever you want, just not out here in the open. 
 What are you looking for? 
 Specifically. 
 My son. 
 (Horn honks in distance) 
 (Sighs) 
 Look, he's only 17. I just... 
 I can't go home until I find him. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Wha... 
 Not good. (Scoffs) 
 If he didn't communicate a price, then why the hell did you signal? 
 It was just a mistake. 
 The guy freaked me out. I... it just threw me off. 
 What? 
 You're expecting Prince Charming? 
 It won't happen again. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Fine. 
 Yeah? 
 She hasn't made a bust yet, Sam. 
 (Door opens) 
 She'll be fine. 
 (Horn honks) 
 Did you contact the police? 
 Well, sure. 
 And if he was 8 or 9, maybe it'd make a difference, but Josh is 17. He's not a big priority for the cops. 
 U... uh, how do you know he was here? 
 One of our neighbors thought he saw him downtown a few days ago. 
 He's got no money. 
 I just... I figured, 'cause... well, he's like you. 
 What do you mean, like me? 
 You know... queer. 
 You got a picture or somethin'? 
 Yeah. Uh... 
 We had a fight. 
 (Sighs) 
 He told me he was gay, and I hit him. 
 (Sighs) 
 I thought he was gonna hit me back. But he didn't. He just... he just left. 
 (Whispers) God, I'm... 
 (Normal voice) so sorry. 
 You can tell him when you see him. 
 I'll keep my eyes open, all right? 
 Thank you. 
 (Siren wailing) 
 Thanks. 
 (Indistinct police radio chatter) 
 Hey, my car. Some chick's stealing my car. 
 Yes. 
 (Starts engine) 
 (Siren wailing) 
 Dispatch, this is 1505 again. I got someone stealing a car. 
 In pursuit of the vehicle. Driver refuses to pull over. 
 Marker is Alpha, yankee, yankee, lima, 8, 0, 5. 
 Looks like... (Siren whoops) 
 No, wait. Car has stopped. (Engine revs) 
 No... okay, it's not stopped. It's going. 
 Um... (Tires screech, siren whoops) 
 Suspect is not stopping. 
 Continuing to pursue. 
 Pursuing on foot. (Turns off siren) 
 (Engine sputtering) 
 (Indistinct police radio chatter) 
 Ma'am, pull over! 
 O... out of the c... uh, suspect is traveling Southbound on Pembroke. 
 Ma'am! Stop the car right now. Hey! That is it. 
 Stop the car right now! Stop the car right now. 
 Roll down the window. 
 Woman : 1505, please report. 
 (Whirs) Sadie! 
 Man : Epstein, are you 10-4? 
 (Vehicle approaching) 
 I got it. I got it. 
 Hey, looking for a date? 
 Careful, McNally. Don't overdo it. 
 Just let it happen. 
 You a cop? 
 (Scoffs) Yeah. I'm a cop. You figured me out. (Laughs) 
 Reach in. Grab my crotch. 
 (Laughs nervously) 
 (Laughs) Teeth out of a magazine. 
 No track marks. 
 I think you're a cop. 
 Well, you think wrong. 
 If you're not a cop, get in the car. 
 Andy, just give me the signal. 
 I, uh, I can't. 
 I knew it. (Starts engine) 
 (Loudly) You're a cop, huh? Cop! She's a cop! 
 No. N... n... n... no, I'm not... 
 (Groans) 
 (Indistinct shouting) (Whispers) What? 
 (Mouths word) 
 I'm not. 
 He told me to grab his crotch. What was I supposed to say? 
 You wing it. You say, uh, "we're not giving out freebies." 
 We went over this. 
 Okay, well, it's early, so I'll just make it up. 
 (Gail) No, it's pointless. 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Why? 
 Because you practically announced that you were a cop  to every car that came near you. 
 You know, we should do a unit move. 
 There's still a lot of action happening at parkdale. 
 Maybe we could get the girls over there to beat it, but that's a serious pain in the ass. 
 Well, I'll move. 
 Not you. You're done. 
 Epstein, I need you to take McNally back with you to the barn. 
 (Dov) Roger that, sir. 
 What? Oh, come on. I know what to expect now. 
 Just give me another chance. 
 It's not up to me. That was Boyko. He wants to see you now. 
 What can I say, McNally? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Maybe if you had my back earlier... 
 I had a senior guy ask me an honest question. 
 I gave him an honest answer. 
 Hey, hey! 
 You know what, guys? I wasn't hooking and, uh, that guy lent me his car. 
 You knew I wanted a chance out there. 
 Working U.C. could have been my niche. 
 Diaz didn't even want to do it. 
 How am I supposed to... 
 O... okay. 
 You know what? (Laughs) I was hooking. That's true. 
 But I didn't steal anything! I didn't steal anything. 
 He lent it to me. 
 I certainly would've been better at it than you. Pfft. Man, Boyko is gonna flip. Yeah, it's really easy to stay out of trouble when you're sitting in a car doing nothing. Okay. I'm sorry. I did steal it. I did steal it, but you know what? He deserved it. Please, please. Okay? I got things to offer, you know. (Car door closes) Okay? I... I know guys that are holding drugs and weapons. Okay? I g... I got great tips. You know, I can make a deal. Oh, thank you, Sadie, but unlike my colleague here, I'm doing just fine without anybody's tips. Pfft. You Epstein? Yes. Boyko wants to see you in his office... now. 
 
 (Door buzzes, beeps) No, I get it. Every rookie screws up now and then, makes mistakes, but this... McNally, your training officer told me you were ready for this. I guess I should have him in here instead? No, no. I screwed up. Well, you weren't the only one. Isn't that right, officer? Sir? When you were yakking nonstop over the air, dispatch was trying to send cars out to a 9-1-1 for a multi-vehicle accident. You guys were assigned to 15 because we were told you're the best rookies in the city, but, you know, right now I am just not seeing that. I mean, are you? No, sir. No, sir. Probation doesn't just mean don't screw up." It also means surprise me." Impress me. Show a little initiative. Just go. Those boots are really something. (Scoffs) Yeah, well, they look better than they feel. Thought you were working the street tonight? (Sighs) I was, but a John called me out, and I froze. I burned a whole corner. Boyko is seriously disappointed. No. God, I am, like, the worst liar in the world. I just... I d... don't know how to do it. You ever heard the saying, "show me a man's flaw, and I will show you the kernel of his brilliance"? So my brilliance is that I'm a terrible liar? Andy, you can't think of it that way. All right, you're not a bad liar. You're an... Idiot? Honest person. You have an open face, straight up. You know how to listen. Just reframe it. Use all that stuff to your advantage. Don't... don't think of it as a weakness. Play to your strengths. Here. I've already had too many. Who are you? You perfect or something, huh? Is that your flaw? (Laughs) More important question... How you gonna make it up to Boyko? (Door beeps) Hey, you process her yet? Just getting started. Why? Come here. Okay, we screwed up tonight, right? Where does that leave us? I mean, what've we even got? Uh, we've got Boyko on our ass, you've got sore feet... and we've got a girl who stole a car in the lamest possible way. Or we have an informant who claims to have a decent tip. Look, Boyko wants us to show initiative. Maybe we deal her out for a bigger tip. Sadie. Earlier you mentioned you might have a good tip. How good we talking? So this guy has illegal guns? How many? She says she's seen at least five, maybe ten, and he told her they were unregistered. Okay. That could be considered trafficking. Look, if it pans out, I'd say, yeah, it's worth making the deal. (Cell phone rings) Oh, great. (Clears throat) Can you hold? Uh, who's your witness? She reliable? Uh... I don't... I don't... Guys, you need a reliable source if you're gonna get a warrant. What if she's got proof? Witness has got proof, you're good to go. (Beep) Yeah, go for Jerry. Uh-huh. Sorry. Good-bye. No, n... not you. Yeah, this is gonna be great, right? Yeah, are you kidding me? If Sadie's tip pans out, we dig ourselves right out of this hole. Okay. And if it doesn't? Well, she goes right back to booking. No harm, no foul. (Unzips boot) Okay, I don't want to do anything stupid tonight. I've done enough damage. It's not stupid. It's taking initiative. (Unzips boot) Besides, Boyko said it. We don't prove we deserve to be here, we're not gonna be. Yeah, you're right. Simple, all right? We check it out. No big deal. Serve, protect... Save our own asses. Let's do it to it. (Dog barking in distance) I'm telling you, that guy's got at least five guns in there, maybe more. I've seen them. Yeah, well, we can't go in there, not without grounds. Look, I thought we were gonna be able to get a little closer. You know, maybe see in. Okay, well, I'm saying they're in there. What else do you need? Uh, proof. Maybe that way we could get a warrant. Come on, Sadie. You're not the most reliable source. What if they moved the guns? What if they're gone? Okay. Okay, you want me to go in and make sure? No. 'Cause I... I can. I'll be in and out in five minutes. No way. It's too risky. Look, come on. I know this guy. I mean, every Saturday's a party night with him. Right now he's gonna be with one of the new girls in some cheap-ass room at a motor lodge. You know, he's not gonna be back till morning. Sadie. Look, I just got off probation, okay? If I go back to jail again, it's over. Please. You guys need this. I need this. We need proof the guns are in there, like a picture. You have a cell phone? I got a pager. They still make those? Fine. Take this. In and out in five minutes. All right, no sweat. Thank you, guys. I'll be back in five. Okay. My stomach is churning. That's called the thrill of the job." What about the newspapers under his clothes? What about 'em? Well, if he had them stuffed under his clothes, they must have been important to him. Under his clothes, I don't think he was reading the paper. Insulation. He was using them to keep warm. I already contacted the university to see if any of the engineering students were having financial difficulties. Poor kid was probably homeless. He wasn't homeless long. He was wearing $200 jeans. He had brand-new shoes. The only thing old that he was wearing was his jacket. How do you know his jacket's old? Creases in the arms, a few moth holes, and it was big. If it was new, you'd think it would at least fit him. Could be his Dad's or his brother's. Well, he's probably not even a student. We're barking up the wrong tree. (Sighs) That would explain why nobody at the university recognized his photo, 'cause he's not even a student. She's been in there way too long. Maybe she can't find the guns. Or maybe there are no guns. Maybe she just bailed and walked out the back door and is stealing another car. (Engine turns off) Let's hope she did bail. What if she's still in there? I don't know. I'm going in. No, no! On what cause? I don't know. I'll make up a noise complaint or something. Ugh. That's not really gonna fly, okay? Who's gonna make a noise complaint right now? There's nobody else within a mile of this place. Okay, I'll go in. No way. Yeah. I'm not even in uniform, okay? I'm just gonna go in there. I'll take a look around. It's no big deal. I'll just... I'll wing it. (Clatter) (Whispers) Ow. Wing it? (Hip-hop music playing) (Knocks on door) Hey, sorry to bother you guys. Um, crappy car, okay? Super crappy, and it's sputtering all the time, backfires, and it actually stalls every time I try to pick up speed. Anyway, the point is... is that it's stalled out there, and I kind of have no idea what to do. Probably the fuel filter or maybe the pump. No, no. If it was the pump, it wouldn't start at all. Oh. Okay, so then it's probably the filter. Yeah, I guess. Great. Um, can I get one? Sorry, lady. The place is closed. Oh, come on. Guys, I... I'm... I'm a little desperate here, okay? Do you think that maybe I could at least use the phone? It's just that my car is practically in the middle of the road, and I don't want the cops taking it. I guess I could sit on the steps until, you know, I get a tow truck. Pete, just grab her a filter. I'll meet you around back. Really? Thank you so much. I really... you're awesome. Wait here. I'll be right back. One minute. Okay. ♪ Man : Trevor McKenzie. Uh, business number 416-555-... (Door beeps) Pretty impressive. You really racked 'em up tonight. Please, folks, I... I didn't do anything, okay? I didn't even touch him. No, but you did offer 10 bucks for me to touch you. 10 bucks? Mm. Really sold yourself short there, Diaz. Have a little pride. (Door buzzes, beeps) You seen this kid? No. Hmm? Anyone? Okay. Well, if any one of you came across him tonight, you'd be doing yourself a real favor if you could tell me what you know. (Whispers) Sadie! What are you doing? I told you to wait back there. What's she doing here? You... I know you. Yeah, you're that whore that blew me off. Her car broke down. Yeah. Um, I was just driving home, and... You let her in? You better start unloading, you want to get it done. You know, we're just... we're gonna leave. Mm-hmm. So... you know the snake. Dean, we're just working together. I went looking for my snake. No snake. Tried to get me a dog. Well, the dog took off. I come back here, mm, all by myself, sad and lonely. Knock, knock, knock. Guess who's at my door? Yeah. We were really looking for car parts. No. Don't lie. Looks like my Saturday night just turned around. (Chuckles) (Door squeaks) There you go, honey. Get undressed. I don't give away freebies. Free? Just gave you a beer. Yeah. Take a hell of a lot more than that. I can tell you that much. Ah. You're like the snake. (Sets down bottle) Need to get flattened first? Okay. What does that mean? It means you want the hard stuff. Sadie, what happened? (Voice breaking) Get me out of here now! What happened? (Whimpers) I don't know. He was here. I couldn't find the guns. I didn't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? The guy's a psycho! All right, fine, whatever. Just give me the phone. Tell him you're a cop. Yeah, I can't tell him I'm a cop. I don't have my gun on me. Tell him you're a... oh, God! I'm calling Dov. Hey! Stop! Gimme that. Gimme that. (Cell phone smashes) (Velcro rips) (Beeps) (Phone rings) Hey, this is Andy. Leave a message. (Beep) (Thud) Get on all fours. (Whimpers) I said get on your hands and knees. I'm gonna poke holes in both of you. Dean, you don't get who she is. Sadie, stop. Dean... Spit it out, snake. She... Okay, just... look, the truth is... I'm not... I'm not really a hooker, okay? I was just trying something new tonight, and it turns out I'm really bad at it. That's... that's it. (Crying) (Sadie) She's a... she's a... Sadie. Sadie. Speak. (Whimpers) Speak. Speak. Dean, she's a cop. Ohh. And I'm sorry. (Crying) Look at me! What are you thinking?! You stupid bitch! Bringing a cop in here? Just leave her alone. That why you wouldn't get in my car tonight? What are you looking for? I just came back for Sadie. You watching me? That it? No. Turn around. Just let us go right now. Turn around! Snake, get over there. Turn around. Listen, Sadie's just scared, okay? She doesn't know what she's talking about, 'cause if I was really a cop, I would have a badge and a gun, and I don't... I don't have either. Unless... you wearing a wire? No. Please don't. Huh? Yeah. No wire. Hey! Anyone else in here? No. There's nobody. I swear. There's nobody else but us, okay? There's nobody else. Good. Okay. Okay. (Men speaking indistinctly) Police, don't move! Hands up now! In the air where I can see 'em! You ought to think about this, okay? You don't want to do this. What? Shoot a couple of whores? She's not a whore. She's a cop. Really? 'Cause I don't see a uniform. No badge. No gun. All I see is a piece of strange trespassing on my property. I got no option but to shoot. Okay, whatever you do to me, just let Sadie go first. It's a shame about you, honey. (Grunts) Ohh! Dispatch, 1505. Shots fired. Please send backup. 1745 Eastern. (Whoosh) (Grunting) Don't move! Put the gun down. Now! (Gun clatters) Get off me. (Panting) Face the car. Hands on the hood. What kind of cops are you?! You should have never let me in here! (Crying) (Indistinct police radio chatter) (Siren wails) Waiting for Swarek? Yeah. Matthew, do you want to look after, uh, Sadie, please? Thank you. Sir. Congratulations, Epstein. Those guys you cuffed upstairs, quick guesstimate, I'd say they were unloading at least, uh, 40 unregistered weapons. Someone's making the news. Let's just hope they leave out the part where, uh, 2 rookies from 15 put a civilian's life in danger to make the bust. Sir, we thought it was... Sadie said it was safe. Yeah, of course she said it was safe. The girl would have said anything not to go back to jail. The thing is, it's your job... to know why people are saying what they're saying. You want to be a cop, learn to read the signs. The two of you put a desperate woman's life in danger to make yourselves look good, and you nearly got yourself killed in the process. Nice work. Hey, guys. These two did good, sir. So I hear. Between the two of you, almost two dozen arrests. Thank you. It was a really rewarding experience. Oh, come on. Was it really that painful? (Chuckles) You smell good. We thought there might have been five or six illegal weapons, but as soon as I stepped into that building, I could smell there were more. I mean, I was operating on instinct... pure, raw instinct. It was... yeah, okay, mom. Um, I gotta go. I'm sorry I woke you. I love you, too. Bye. (Beep, flips cell phone shut) Long night, huh? Yeah, yeah. Turned out all right. I don't get it. (Chuckles) Really, I don't, Epstein. You're, um, a smart guy, right? You're, uh, probably could have gone to law school or be working finance. But, uh, you're just playing the angles. You're playing the funny guy. Why are you here? This is all I've ever wanted to do. Okay. So then why don't you quit playing this like it's a game, like it's something that you can win? Okay, 'cause you... you are smart, and you're fast. And... and you think outside the box, and those are all really good things. So maybe you just... Slow it down a bit, and, uh, and you... and... and you be that for a while. (Closes locker) Night. Hey. (Indistinct conversations, telephone ringing) Hey. Oh, hey. Oh, man. My bed is gonna feel so good. Oh, yeah. It was a long night. No kidding. Well, uh, well, have a good sleep. You, too. Huh.
