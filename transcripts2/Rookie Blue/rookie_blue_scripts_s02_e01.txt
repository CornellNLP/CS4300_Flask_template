 Okay, I know I had a few drinks last night, But I could've sworn when I came home, this place was full of boxes. 
 I know. I unpacked this morning. Want a tour? 
 No, that's okay. 
 It'll just be like a scavenger hunt every morning. 
 It'll be great. 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm just scattered. I got court this morning. 
 What, you got butterflies, detective? 
 Yeah, a little, before I testify. It's no big deal. 
 Mm-hmm. Well, you look great. 
 (Chuckles)

 Yeah, so do you.

 (Razor buzzing) 
 Ooh, I'm really hoping those aren't Dov's hands. (Giggles) 
 (Chuckles) You know what I'm hoping? 
 Yeah, I keep telling you, your voice will drop once puberty hits. 
 Thanks, hon. 
 Actually, I was hoping to use my bathroom, in my apartment, because, you know, I pay rent here. 
 Sorry. Sorry, bro. 
 (Horn blares in distance) 
 Six weeks off the job. It feels great to be back in action. 
 (Lowered voice) So how long is Gail gonna be here, man? 
 'cause I didn't sign up for another roommate. 
 What are you talking about? She's not a roommate. 
 Sweetie, don't put your brush in my drawer. Your hair gets in my moisturizer, and it's nasty. 
 Sorry, babe. 
 W-what? 
 Nothing. Nothing. I'm just gonna go take a pee... In your room. 
 (Horn honks, engine starts) 
 What's that? 
 A little housewarming card for your new place. 
 Apparently, that's you and Luke. 
 Aw! 
 Leo is in his purple phase. 
 Very cute. Thank you. 
 So how's the move going? You settled? 
 Uh... yeah. 
 It's great. I actually have everything unpacked. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 You, the girl who took six months To hang pictures in her last place? 
 I know. It's... it's different now. 
 It's like... It's like I know where everything belongs. 
 It's very good. 
 Is that... Boyd? 
 Yeah. 
 What is he doing here? 
 Trying to get Swarek back into Guns and Gangs, some kinda task force. 
 (Telephone rings) 
 McNally, Nash. 
 Sir. 
 Uh... I need you over at Supernova. 
 There's a concert going on there. 
 1,000 wristbands went out, and they only got room for 800. 
 You're in charge, McNally. Take the other rookies. 
 Great. Who's playin'? 
 Just another day at the office. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Man : ♪ yeah ♪ 
 I said, get down! 
 Oh, I was looking for my friends. 
 Yeah, you were standing on top of my cruiser. 
 I wasn't standing. I was dancing. 
 (Handcuffs clicking) 
 What are you on, genius? 
 Um, natural high. 
 (Handcuffs clicking) 
 Pfft. Natural high, my ass. Let's go. Let's go! 
 (Crowd cheering) 
 Man : Thank you. 
 (Trara) - Okay, okay. 
 Man : - Thank you. 
 That's enough. 
 (Speaks indistinctly) 
 Hey, Andy, what do you want me to do with the rest of the stragglers? 
 Uh, if they have wristbands, get 'em in line. 
 If not, uh, put 'em on the sidewalk. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, so, uh, I was just wondering... and it's totally cool with me either way... 
 But, uh, how long do you think you'll be staying, you know, at the place? 
 Stop shoving. Play nice. 
 Oh, you were wondering? 
 Come on, people. If you're hiding any alcohol or drugs, now's your chance to dump it. 
 Have your pockets and purses ready to be searched. 
 Better be water in that bottle. 
 Officer Epstein. 
 Come on, people. Patience is a virtue. 
 Dov? Dov Epstein? 
 Mark? Mark Johnson. How are you? 
 Great, man. I... wow. Not in a million years. 
 Dov. 
 I haven't seen you since, uh... 
 Your brother's birthday. 
 Yeah. 
 The big 2-5. Barbecue caught on fire, Where the... barbecue caught on fire. 
 Yeah, man. 
 So how's he doing? How is Adam? 
 Great. He's great. Uh... 
 Actually, I-I don't know why I just said that. 
 He died about four years ago, so yeah... 
 Uh, anyway, great to see you, Mark. Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go, people. Wait now, tweet later. 
 All right, they're letting them in ten at a time. 
 We just need to keep the rest of 'em calm. 
 (Siren whoops) 
 This is what happens when you put the word free" in front of the word concert". 
 See, I love it. That's free music. 
 That's culture to the masses. 
 Whoa! 
 (Tires screech) 
 Man : Hey! 
 Do not get any of your culture on my car, buddy. 
 (Men) - Aw! 
 That's right. Take it over there. 
 What are you practicing your "Bad Cop" routine for Guns and Gangs? 
 I haven't decided yet. 
 What's holding you back? 
 You. 
 Love working with you, McNally can't imagine my life without you in it. 
 Hey, you get to wear all that hair gel again. 
 (Dov) We've got a problem at the door. 
 I'm on it. 
 See you later. 
 (Indistinct conversations, rock music playing) 
 What's up? 
 50 more... that's it. 
 Then the doors are shutting for good. 
 Great. The crowd's gonna go nuts. 
 Let's hope. Maybe the riot squad will let me shoot someone with a water cannon. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 I haven't driven over 60 on this job. I need a little action. 
 Fine. Then go take the back of the line. They're definitely not getting in. 
 (Crowd shouting indistinctly) 
 All right, you guys, cool it. 
 Any pushing or shoving, and you're going home. 
 Sorry to bother you, officer, but security told me that the line was over here, and I was waiting over there, and I didn't want to leave, just in case... I feel ridiculous. 
 My only job was to stand in line and watch my friend's place, and now I'm not even in that line. 
 Look, I'm watching my roommate's spot. We have wristbands. 
 W-where's your friend? 
 She's just around the corner. 
 There's nothing I can do. 
 I mean, we're closing it off. 
 Look, she went to go get hot chocolate for me at Artie's. 
 I got confused. The guy said that it was to the right, and... 
 You always do what people tell you to do? 
 Pretty much. 
 Yeah, me, too. Well, used to, anyway. 
 Artie's is really good, by the way. It takes forever, but... 
 You can't hurry love. 
 That's true. (Chuckles) 
 All right, I'll make sure I get you guys in. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Seriously, my roommate has been dying to see this show. 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 Hey, boss. 
 I'm gonna keep things moving, if, uh, that's okay with you. 
 Okay. 
 Boyfriend? 
 No. He's my tr... well, was my training officer. 
 He's cute. I had a lab partner like that. 
 Acts all tough, but... 
 Oh, yeah? 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Crowd screaming) 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Gunshot) 
 (Crowd shouting) 
 (Screaming) 
 Lie back! Lie back! 
 (Gasping) 
 (Continues gasping) 
 (Shouts inaudibly) 
 1309. Shots fired. 
 Supernova, Queens Quay and Richardson. 
 Two people shot. Officer down. 
 Rush an ambulance right away. Repeat... officer down. 
 It's okay. It's all right. 
 Just let the air out. 
 (Gasps) 
 McNally, you're gonna be fine, okay? You gotta stay down. 
 Don't try to get up. All right? Looks like the bullet just got stuck in your vest. Just stay put. 
 Just try to breathe, okay? Andy. Andy, you're fine. 
 You just got winded. The bullet's stuck in your vest. 
 Okay? I'll be back. I gotta be the boss right now. 
 (Groans) 
 (Panting) 
 (Siren whoops) 
 Oh. 
 Nash, Diaz, get that thing. Move it over there. 
 Get it out of the way. 
 (Oliver) - Right here. Right here. 
 (Sam) Gunshot wound, the back of the head... the red jacket. 
 Back of the head. That's all that I can see. I got pressure on it. 
 I'm right here. 
 (Panting) 
 No, no, no, no, no, McNally. McNally, sit back. 
 Sit back, relax. It's okay, okay? 
 I need you to stay put for a second we gotta get you checked out. 
 I'm good. I'm fine. 
 I know you are. I know you are. But that blood, that bullet... 
 You're evidence, okay? Just breathe. Ohh. 
 Hey, Epstein, you're gonna stay with the girl. 
 Diaz, round up those people. Get 'em over there. 
 Don't let anybody go, all right? Get 'em all over there. (Siren whooping) 
 (Chris) Okay, everybody, I need all of you to step back. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 What happened?! 
 Uh, j... you can't go. 
 Calm down. Just calm down. 
 Kate! (Panting) 
 Calm down. Calm down. 
 Just calm down. Oh, my God! 
 (Oliver) All right, Epstein, you're gonna stay with her until further notice. 
 Okay? Write everything down... time of arrival, time that she goes into surgery, all of her doctors' names, time that she's declared... if she's declared. 
 Okay? Stay on your phone. I'm gonna go find her family. 
 Wait. What's her name? 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 Kate. I think her name is Kate. 
 (Sirens wailing) 
 Woman : I need you to bag her for me. C.T.A.S. One. 
 I have a 22-year-old female with a G.S.W. to the head. 
 G.C.S. Is a 3. E.T.A. 5 minutes. 
 What's happening? 
 Anyone notifying her next of kin? 
 Oliver's working on it. 
 Good. 
 (Horn blares) 
 Shots came from over there. 
 We got 3 casings from a .380 1 of them got trampled. 
 No sign of the weapon. 
 Peck and Diaz are rounding up witnesses. 
 The victim's roommate is heading to the station. 
 Who's helping from homicide? 
 Oh, we're tryingto reach Callahan, but he's in court all day. 
 He's got his phone off. Not that this is a homicide. 
 Looks like it's gonna be. 
 Oh, and we are going to treat it as such. 
 Detective, thanks for coming. 
 Heard most of it on the radio on my way over. 
 I'm glad to help. Got me out of a sewer. Mm. 
 Detective Jo Rosati. She was trained at homicide. 
 She works out at 27. 
 Sam Swarek. 
 Hey. Oliver Shaw. How are you? 
 Where's the rookie... the one who got hit? 
 Andy McNally. She's right over there. 
 Okay, then. Uh, I'm gonna start with her. 
 You guys look like you have the rest of this under control. 
 (Frank) - You did good, McNally. 
 Frank. 
 Jo, good to see you. McNally, this is, uh, Detective Rosati. 
 She's gonna ask you a few questions. 
 That hurt? You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 (Police radio chatter continues) 
 First of all, we're gonna need your vest, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Walter, right? 
 It's okay. 
 Just relax. Relax. 
 (Tools clatter) 
 (Velcro ripping) 
 (Velcro ripping) 
 Okay. Let's have a look. Sorry? 
 I'm serious. You're gonna have to go to the hospital. 
 Let's see how soon. 
 I'm fine, really. 
 How many times have you said that today? 
 A hundred. 
 Well, you're probably gonna have to say it about a hundred more, but good on ya. 
 McNally, right? 
 Yeah. 
 You wanna tell me what happened? 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, I, uh... 
 It's no rush, okay? No big deal. 
 I got shot once. 
 Vest, right up here. 
 Puked for three days. Didn't go to work for a month. 
 (Chuckles) I was... I was the painkiller queen. 
 I could tell you every soap opera plot for 33 days. 
 She was really nice. 
 That girl was... Very sweet. 
 Anyway, I-I let her in, And, uh, I shouldn't have. 
 I-I could've made her go home, but I-I let her in. 
 Sure. She was nice. Of course you let her in. 
 (Sighs) so... so I did, and, um, We were just talking. 
 She was behind me. 
 We were talking about, um, hot... hot chocolate, And... 
 And then there was the sh... 
 She... she got shot. Oh, my God. 
 You're doing great. 
 Okay? 
 Oh. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Hey, how you feeling? 
 I'm fine. Sam, that was really scary, And that hurt so bad. I'm all right. I'm all right. 
 It's just that I've already got this bruise that's forming, and... 
 What? 
 Sam. 
 You gotta be kidding me. You gotta get behind that truck. 
 Police. Get your hands up. Hands up. 
 All right. Allright. 
 You got any weapons on you? 
 No. 
 Turn around. Get down on the ground. Down on the ground. 
 (Clank) 
 If you got a gun on you, so help me God. 
 Give me that. 
 (Handcuffs click) 
 This is Swarek. I got a male party in possession of a .380. I'm in a lot behind the communications truck. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 (Siren wails) 
 (Siren whoops) 
 Man : Please. I'm telling you the truth. 
 It's not mine. Someone must've left it there. 
 You should be looking for them right now. (Brakes squeal) 
 I was just minding my own business, going for a walk, and I found it, okay? Look, how many times do I have to tell you? It was there on the sidewalk. I-I-I picked it up! 
 That's probably enough times. So you can shut up now. 
 Man : I was gonna turn it in to you guys. I swear. 
 Is that him? 
 Oscar Benson... 17, resides at 422 Beckett. 
 Good. Let's get started. 
 Ident's on the way over to check for G.S.R., so don't let him wash his hands. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 What the hell is G.S.R.? 'Cause whatever it is, I don't have it. 
 Oscar, it's okay. It's okay. 
 This is just standard procedure. We're gonna have you out in no time, all right? 
 But, uh, let's get you a place to sit and, um, I'll find you, uh, something to drink once we get in there. (Door buzzes) 
 (Traci) Right this way. 
 She just bought you guys about 20 minutes... (door buzzers) before that kid starts thinking lawyer. 
 She's good. 
 Yeah, she is. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 The hospital is five minutes from here. 
 Yeah, it's a very... it's a very quick trip. 
 You know that talk you were gonna give me? 
 W-what talk? 
 My first day. 
 You said that we were gonna go and get a coffee, and you were gonna give me the talk. 
 That's, uh, that's a aong time ago. 
 Not really. 
 Okay. 
 Um... (clears throat) I'm Oliver. 
 Oliver Shaw. I'll be your training officer, uh, until further notice. 
 You don't touch anything in the car until, uh, I tell you to. 
 You don't write anything down in your memo book until I tell you to. You don't talk to oth-other people. 
 You look at me first. You do as I say, not as, um, I do. 
 I know you probably think right now I'm... I'm being a bit of a hard-ass, but if it gets stressed out there, I will be, because my... 
 My job is to keep you safe. 
 This crest, uh, on my shoulder... this represents, you, McNally, and we're... we're both going home today. 
 (Police radio chatter continues) 
 (Voice breaks) That's a really good talk. 
 (Water running) 
 (Door opens) 
 Andy? Andy. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. It's not mine. 
 Where'd it get you? 
 It's just my ribs. It's fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 Ow. Ow, ow, ow. 
 Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. 
 No, it's okay. It's okay. Relax, okay? It's just sore. 
 (Door opens) 
 McNally. 
 (Chuckles) S-sorry. 
 Uh, the roommate wants... 
 (Door opens) 
 Detective Callaghan. 
 Jo, what are you doing here? 
 I'm just in to help. 
 The roommate wants to talk to you. She's in the D's office. 
 If you're up for it. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Clears throat) I hear we got the shooter. 
 Yeah, looks like. We found a kid with a gun. 
 We're just about to talk to him. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Just give 'em your statement. I'll drive you home. 
 Yeah, you know what? I understand that. 
 I'm fine, okay? 
 I want to be here. I need to be here. 
 Yeah. 
 We'd been in line for, like, an hour. I mean, she was cold. 
 She's always freezing. So I went to get us some hot chocolate. 
 And I shouldn't have gone. I shouldn't have waited for it. 
 I should've just come right back. 
 Miranda, I get what you're saying, but it wouldn't have changed anything. 
 She didn't even want to come today. 
 Kate barely even listens to music. I mean, she listens to classical. 
 But she says it helps her study. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we're just talking about Kate. 
 Okay. 
 (Door closes) 
 
 
 
 Oscar Benson... no priors, but his brother's in a gang. 
 Doesn't mean he is. 
 Doesn't mean he isn't. 
 Think it's an initiation? 
 Yeah, targeting a cop... in certain circles, that might buy you some credibility. 
 Okay, Luke, we got it. 
 What, are you serious? 
 Yeah, I called her. You were in court. I needed backup. 
 Yeah, but I'm here now, and this guy shot a cop. 
 A cop who happens to be your girlfriend. 
 I mean, unless she's not, and you just like to make out with every cute officer who takes a bullet. 
 Uh, I-it's a conflict. Okay, you do live with her. 
 Wow. Congratulations. 
 Jerry, this is what I do, all right? 
 So I'm doing something. 
 All right, your name goes on nothing, and you have to stay away from this guy. 
 Fine. 
 I'm gonna take first crack. Uh, all right with you? 
 I'm not really up for playing good cop. 
 You guys used to partner together, right? 
 Yeah. 
 She ever play good cop? 
 No. 
 Right. 
 (Door beeps, buzzes) 
 So the girl you shot's in critical condition. and guess what else. 
 You also shot a police officer, Oscar. 
 I didn't shoot anyone. 
 Can you just tell me who you were aiming for, or should I ask your brother? 
 My brother has nothing to do with it. 
 So you did it all by yourself? 
 That's not what I meant. 
 I seriously doubt that you were aiming for Kate Novatski, but I guess that's the problem with shooting into a crowd. 
 I saw a gun on the sidewalk. 
 I picked it up. 
 Why didn't you come forward? 
 I wanted to sell it. I could get 500 bucks for that thing. 
 You found it? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 (Siren wails) 
 They took her into surgery at 14:43. 
 (Siren whoops) 
 Doesn't look good. What else can I do? 
 I'll call you back. 
 (Beep) 
 (Elevator bell dings) Ms. Novatski. 
 Where's Katie? Is she okay? 
 She's in surgery right now. 
 I'll take you there. 
 You were with her? 
 I was in the ambulance. 
 Was she awake? Responsive? 
 How much blood did she lose? 
 Ma'am, a doctor will give you all that... 
 Okay, look, please. I'm a nurse at Oakville General. 
 I know how these things work. 
 They're gonna shove me into a waiting room, And they're not gonna tell me anything until she's out of surgery, so... 
 I need to know something. 
 (Elevator bell dings) 
 She was outside at a concert hall. 
 There were shots fired. 
 She got hit. 
 Where? 
 Where was she hit? 
 It's a head injury. 
 (Crying) 
 Was there any brain activity? 
 (Panting) 
 Ms. Novatski, Oh! you need to talk to a doctor. 
 (Sobbing) 
 Katie... she wanted to be a... an organ donor. 
 It was really important to her. 
 And she's young, and she's, uh... she's healthy, so with a head wound, she's a very good candidate to be a donor. 
 So you need to help me. 
 Okay. 
 (Helicopter whirring) 
 (Chris) Somebody must've seen something. we just gotta jog their brains a bit. 
 (Belches) 
 (Gail) - Charming. 
 Don't judge me. 
 Too late. 
 All right, everyone take a seat, over there. 
 All right, since none of you ran when the shots were fired, and we didn't find any weapons on you, right now you're not suspects. 
 But nobody is going home until we know everything you know. 
 Yeah, every little detail, and we really don't care if it takes all night. 
 I'll stay up all night with you. 
 You'll stay up all night washing the pepper spray out of your eyes if don't let go of me right now. 
 Ooh. (Chuckles) 
 (Chris) All right, who wants to go first? 
 How about who's had less than six drinks today? 
 Lightweight, you're up. 
 I got something, but I don't think you're gonna like it. 
 Try me. 
 2:33 P.M.... The exact time the gunshots were fired... 
 Oscar Benson was on his phone. 
 With his gangbanging brother? 
 No, with his God-fearing mother. They were on from 2:26 to 2:37 P.M. 
 11 minutes on the phone with his mother. 
 That'd be a record for me. I'd definitely shoot somebody. 
 I told you you weren't gonna like it. 
 I like anything that gets us answers. 
 So maybe he did find the gun. 
 At least we still got the weapon. Yeah. That was ballistics. 
 The gun was jammed, but the bullet we got out of Andy's vest is a match to Oscar's gun. 
 The gun jammed? 
 Yeah, that means shot number four never made it out of the barrel. It's over. 
 It's over. I just got back from the hospital. 
 Kate Novatski's not gonna make it. 
 I need a minute of your time. 
 Kate Novatski was pre-med. 
 She wrote her college admissions essay on organ donation. 
 Donor card's complete. It's the only thing her mother wants. 
 We gotta find a way. 
 Dov, as soon as they take her off the respirator, it becomes a homicide. 
 Chain of evidence, forensics, autopsy... 
 We need the body intact. 
 She got shot in the head. 
 We know what happened. 
 What do her lungs have to do with it? What the hell does her heart have to do with it? 
 D-Dov. I get it. You were there with the mother. 
 It's terrible. 
 Yeah, it's terrible, but it doesn't have to be meaningless, 'cause right now that's all it's ever gonna be. 
 But for this woman, for this family, we have a chance to do something that'll actually help 'em get through this, so come on, please. 
 (Jo clears throat) - Fine. 
 So we get a signed confession today, before they take her off the respirator, before they do the autopsy. 
 I'll make a case to the coroner, and we take it from there. 
 No, seriously, let's work it out. 
 Signed confession today, huh? 
 Yeah. It's always good to have a goal. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Man : - Get out of here. 
 Woman : - What time is it? 
 (Andy) Roommate literally laughed When I asked if Kate was involved in anything illicit. 
 Um... she's an "A" student, full scholarship. 
 No... no boyfriend, no enemies. 
 McNally, you gotta go home, okay? 
 No, I don't need to go home, okay? I don't want to go home. 
 What am I gonna do? You want me to watch some TV? Huh? You want me... you want me to take a nap? 
 (He sighs) 
 Listen, if I'm gonna figure this thing out, then I need to understand why... 
 Understand? What are you gonna understand? 
 Shots were fired. You were hit. She was hit. 
 She's on a respirator. 
 Kate. Kate's not a she." 
 It's Kate, and she was standing right next to me, And... and I-I need to know who she is. 
 Okay. Take the roommate back to residence and talk to her on the way. 
 Okay. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 I don't understand. 
 If Kate's on a respirator, then she's still alive. 
 Not exactly. The machine's keeping her breathing, but... I'm so sorry. 
 You know what? I can take you to the hospital right now if you want to see her. 
 No, I don't want to go there. Her mom is there. 
 I'm the reason her daughter's dead or... or almost dead or, like, about to die. 
 I made her come with me. I left her there, in line. 
 I let her in. 
 (Crying) 
 I thought I was being nice. 
 Listen, I-if Kate... 
 Is really who you say she is, then... then... this shot wasn't meant for her. 
 It was an accident. 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 Yes, it was. 
 Right? 
 You sound like my Philosophy T.A. 
 Always trying to make sense of everything by saying, "nothing makes sense." 
 It doesn't change the fact that she got shot And she's almost dead or... 
 (Chris) All right, what about him looked suspicious? 
 I didn't say he  looked  suspicious. 
 I said he was  acting  suspicious. 
 A person isn't suspicious. Their behavior is. 
 I'm doing my master's in criminology. 
 Oh. Well, good for you. 
 So what about his behavior made him suspicious? 
 He was sober. 
 She was standing right in front of me, and I saw the gun in her hand. Or maybe it was a cell phone. 
 It was one of those flip phones, you know, so it kinda looked like it could've been a gun. 
 Anyone cough up anything yet? 
 Uh, one guy threw up a corn dog. 
 We got the day to solve this. 
 Okay. 
 So let's solve it. 
 Okay. 
 If any of you tweeted, texted, blogged, or uploaded any cell phone photos from outside Supernova, step forward now. 
 Larry, you're up. 
 Give me your phone. 
 It's a total violation of the privacy act. 
 Listen, you grad school poser, a 22-year-old girl was murdered today, so if you have any photos of the crime scene, you better show us, or I'll arrest your ass for obstruction of justice. 
 That was so hot. 
 Let's see what you got. 
 (Giggles) 
 (Beeps) 
 You're still thinking gang, huh? 
 I guess you're not. 
 A gun like that is too valuable. 
 Gangbanger's not gonna get rid of it just 'cause it jammed. 
 Well, it's not revenge. It's not like the girl had any enemies. 
 Well, if it ain't revenge and it ain't money... 
 It's love. 
 (Engine starts) 
 I don't know where it is. I mean, I've seen her writing in a journal, but I don't know where she keeps it. 
 Okay. Is this her computer? 
 Yeah. 
 You know her password? 
 No, I would never... I wouldn't ask. 
 She was wearing that coat today. 
 It's mine. I gave it to her when I left. She was freezing. 
 You wear that a lot? 
 Every day. 
 I mean... not now, I guess. 
 We haven't talked about you. 
 What about me? 
 Well, we talked about Kate. We know that she doesn't have any ex-boyfriends, enemies. 
 Well... (Chuckles) 
 Unlike my perfect roommate, there are probably about a million people who hate my guts... 
 A few ex-boyfriends, a couple T.A.s, but it's not them that I care about. It's my friend. 
 Who was wearing your coat. 
 (Gail) Are they printing? 
 Yeah, they're printing. They're printing it right now. 
 I double-printed that last... 
 Did you send me that one from that, uh, the one kid's camera? 
 Yeah. Yeah. You got it? 
 I'm sending things over right now. 
 (Beep) 
 (Typing) 
 (Beep) 
 (Printer whirring) 
 We worked from tweets, tweet pics, tweetdeck Hootsuite, Facebook, and cell phone photos. 
 Not a clue what you're talking about. 
 All these pictures were taken moments before the shots were fired. Now it's possible someone accidentally took a picture of the shooter. 
 All right, bring 'em in. 
 (Dov) All right, everybody, I want you to grab a marker and take a look at these photographs. 
 If you've seen any of these people with this girl... the girl who got shot today... I want you to circle their face. 
 Now be sure. If you're not sure, take a pass. 
 You got something, Poindexter? 
 I know this guy from the student union. 
 (Gail) - So? 
 So I saw him today and I tried to say hi, but he just kept walking. 
 You ever seen him with this girl? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 But I've seen him with... with her. 
 That's Kate's roommate. 
 We should call Andy. 
 I'm gonna grab Detective Rosati. 
 And the student becomes the master. 
 I wouldn't go that far. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Guy's name is Adrian Sparks, 27, a grad student philosophy T.A., lives at 1493 Spadina, apartment 12. 
 Just hold on. It's Andy. She's on the line. 
 (Beep) McNally, can you ask Miranda about a guy named Adrian Sparks? 
 I'm not with Miranda right now. 
 Where are you? 
 I came to the student affairs office. 
 Miranda mentioned filing some grievances. I thought I'd check it out. 
 Hey, "Adrian Sparks" ring a bell? 
 Yeah. Miranda made a complaint against him... two complaints, actually. It's not unusual. 
 Favoritism, harassment, stalking, ignoring, "He loves me." "He hates me." 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, Adrian Sparks was her Philosophy T.A. 
 They had a relationship. 
 And she was the one to break it off. 
 Harassment, a couple of threats, and she even had to get her locks changed. 
 We're working on that. 
 Adrian was up for assistant professor. 
 We passed him over, pending the investigation. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. Good luck. 
 Thanks. 
 (Lowered voice) Okay, Kate was wearing Miranda's coat. 
 It's bright red, very distinctive. 
 Miranda says she wears it every day. 
 From a distance, the two of them look very similar. 
 Okay, McNally, go and get Miranda. We're gonna head over there, all right? 
 Sounds good. 
 (Jo) - All right, let's go. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Miranda? 
 Miranda, please open the door. 
 I just need to talk to you for a minute. 
 (Screaming) 
 Miranda? Hey! Hey, get off of her! 
 You're Adrian. 
 It's okay. It's all right. I'm a friend of Miranda's. 
 This is your ex-boyfriend, the one you were telling me about. 
 You told her about me?! 
 (Miranda) - I didn't say anything! 
 What did you tell her?! 
 Miranda, shut up! Were you at the show today? 
 No. 
 No, you know what? I don't have to do this. 
 (Gun clanks) Yes, you do. So put your hands up and turn around. 
 Please help me! He wants to kill me! He's gonna kill me! 
 Please help me! (Sobbing) 
 Stay here! 
 (Panting) 
 (Continues panting) 
 (Andy) Adrian, stop! 
 Stop! 
 (Siren wailing in distance) 
 (Gun clanks) 
 Don't move! 
 I said... Don't move. 
 (Panting) 
 Look around you, Adrian, 'cause this is it. 
 Turn around. 
 Why? 
 I wanna talk. 
 What, you gonna talk me down off the ledge? I love it. 
 No. 
 I thought that was your job. 
 Not really, so if you wanna jump, then do it. 
 So then why are you pointing a gun at me? 
 I don't know. 
 Doesn't really make much sense, does it? 
 So now we can talk... really talk. 
 Okay, fine. You go first. Why are you doing this? 
 Why not? It's what I wanted in the first place. 
 She'd be over. I'd be over. The whole thing would be over. 
 That didn't work out so well. 
 Miranda's still here. So are you. 
 It's pathetic! 
 And now Kate Novatski is... is dead Because she was cold. 
 Yeah. You're so naive. 
 (Whoosh) 
 You're just like... aah! Uhh! 
 Aah! Let go! No! Don't! 
 I just wanted it to be done! I just wanted to jump! 
 Yeah, I don't care. 
 (Clicking) 
 Let go of me! 
 (Sirens wailing in distance) 
 I just wanted it to be over!

 From nothing to a signed confession in six hours? 
 We've never done that before.

 We did it on that Cardello chain saw thing. 
 I don't think that counts. The chain saw was practically smoking. 
 Remember the, uh, Ivan Wallace fiasco?

 Felt like we'd shacked up with two chalk outlines.
