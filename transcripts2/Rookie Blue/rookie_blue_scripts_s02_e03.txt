 This is Detective Luke Callaghan. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. 
 It's me... Andy. Obviously. 
 I don't know. I just can't sleep. It must be the new place or something. 
 Anyway, uh, well, I guess you're still at work, so I'll just, um... see you when you get home. 
 Okay. I love you. Bye. 
 Luke? 
 Hello? 
 I'm a police Officer! I am armed! 
 I'm coming out! 
 Gross. 
 Stupid! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Y... you... you... what are you doing? 
 Don't sneak up on me like that! 
 I live here! 
 I know! 
 Okay. Come on. Okay. I'm gonna take this out real slow, all right? 
 I'm gonna put it down. 
 Okay. Funny. I'm sorry, okay? It's... the back gate was open. 
 It was making tons of noise, and it just really freaked me out, and I... 
 How was your night? 
 Long. Long. Jimmy Cole got shot. 
 What, that drug dealer with the ugly moustache? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Yeah, Luke, um, what the hell is this? 
 Okay, this isn't exactly how I had this planned. 
 I was thinking maybe more a weekend at the cabin, maybe get a float-plane, take us up to Whitestone. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Watch the sunset. 
 I am so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. I... I was not snooping, I promise. 
 It's just that... 
 No, no. It's... it's fine. It's fine. 
 I was scared. Well, not scared. Obviously, it's me. 
 But nervous, and I... I went, and the gate was open... 
 A... Andy. Andy. Andy, it's fine. It's great. 
 And I think I... the neighbor's dog is possessed. 
 It's great, okay? 
 As long as it ends the same way, unless you don't want to, and then that's fine. It's... it's okay. 
 I do. 
 You do? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand down. 
 Because I'm the police. 
 I said, "stand down. " 
 Because I'm the police. 
 Dov, come on! Hurry up! I need to use the bathroom. 
 I'm not finished yet. 
 Yeah, well, I need to use the shower, so can you hurry up and arrest the mirror already? 
 Gail. 
 If you need to use the shower so bad, use the one at your own damn house. 
 That's what you meant about bringing me coffee I actually did bring you coffee. 
 It's probably cold by now. 
 You know, if you'd slept over, I'd make you coffee... a nice latte. 
 You'd be drinking it right now. 
 Nah. I don't know how I'd explain that one. 
 You're not married to Dex. 
 I know, but he's Leo's Dad, and we live together right now, and I don't want to talk about that right now. 
 I called you, like, four times this morning. 
 Sorry. I just, turned my ringer off, 'cause I had an appointment this morning. 
 Why? What's up? 
 Nothin'. Just, um, got some new bling and wanted you to be the first to know. 
 Shut up. 
 Luke gave it to me last night. 
 That's a diamond. That's a frickin' diamond, Andy. 
 I know. 
 That's amazing. Oh, my God. 
 You girls need a minute? 
 Andy just got engaged. 
 No, I... 
 No way. 
 Really? 
 To Detective Callaghan. 
 Yeah, thanks. I figured. 
 Is that the ring? 
 Yeah. 
 That's gorgeous. Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice work, McNally. 
 Thanks. 
 Just if I were you, I wouldn't wear it out on the street. 
 You don't want to make yourself a target. 
 The late James Cole, Cabbagetown's friendly neighborhood crack dealer. 
 Took four in the chest last night, no witnesses. 
 It's Callaghan's case, but if it's a turf thing, it could get pretty ugly, so keep your eyes open. 
 Speaking of ugly... Oliver? 
 All right, rooks, everybody knows that Friday shifts are bad. 
 There's more drunk and disorderlies and more, uh, more domestics. 
 Friday night, full moon, that's a a hole different story. 
 Diaz. 
 Well, uh, sir, seeing as how the human body is mostly made up of water, and the moon's gravity is responsible for the earth's tides, it stands to reason that we should be affected, too, s... uh, somehow. It's true. 
 Yeah, stupid people do stupid things. It is in their nature. 
 But they will do fewer stupid things if they know we're watching, so stay sharp. 
 Stay visible. Serve. Protect. 
 You got any questions about the earth's tide, talk to Diaz. 
 Thanks. 
 One more thing. 
 I understand congratulations are in order to McNally here... on her engagement to Detective Callaghan. 
 Seriously? You're getting married? 
 Yeah. 
 Andy, way to go. That's great. 
 That's awesome. 
 You know, 'cause it didn't work out for the rest of us doesn't mean that you two shouldn't give it a try... 
 McNally. 
 Noelle. Beautiful Noelle. 
 No. 
 Come on. Please? 
 No! 
 I had him four shifts last week. 
 Well, only four. 
 Ever since he got busted down, he's been a pain in the ass. 
 No, no. An eager pain in the ass. 
 Yeah, well, I think he's got something to prove, you know. 
 The thing is... the thing is, I need this to be kind of a lighter day, you know? 
 Izzy had her pals over for a sleepover, and I overextended myself. 
 I'm totally jet-lagged, and I think I screwed up my back. 
 Not happening. 
 I'll ride with him. 
 Officer Epstein... I'll ride with him. 
 You're not a training Officer. 
 Technically, Dov just has to ride with a supervising Officer, and I can supervise and report in to you at the end of the day. 
 Yeah. I like the sound of that. 
 Yeah, but you just have to make it clear to Dov that I'm... his supervising Officer. 
 You know, just so there's no confusion. 
 I like this one. 
 Look, just... keep him out of trouble, okay? 
 Yep. Got it, sir. 
 Okay. He doesn't need to prove anything. Not today. 
 So... you're pregnant? 
 What? No, I am not pregnant. 
 It just seems like the... this engagement thing happened pretty quickly, and I figured, you know, maybe you didn't... needed to move things along and... 
 Luke and I do live together. 
 Right. What's it been? How long? 
 Doesn't matter how long it's been. I mean when you know, you know. 
 I mean, it's not like I wasn't surprised. 
 Yeah? What, did he hide the ring in a cupcake? 
 No. 
 Yeah, Callaghan's probably more of a skywriting kind of guy. 
 Was a plane involved? 
 No, it wasn't. It was... simple. 
 Well, actually, I... I kinda found the ring in Luke's stuff, and then he came home, and it just happened. 
 You found it in his stuff, and then it just happened. 
 Yeah, but I wasn't snooping. 
 Yeah, it happened, but it... in a good way. 
 Okay. And you said yes. 
 Why wouldn't I? 
 It was spontaneous and romantic, and, uh... it's a good thing. 
 Available units, we've got a 2-car collision in front of 1083 Emerson, corner of Emerson and Lappin. 
 1505. Mark us. We're on our way. 
 Look out! 
 Use the sidewalk, buddy! 
 This is 1505. We're on the scene at the 10-83. We need a bus. 
 We need you to clear the street here, folks. 
 Sir, are you okay? 
 Right of way. It was my go. 
 Yeah, I know. I'm sure it was. 
 I can't undo this thing. 
 That's okay. You know what? Just sit tight. 
 We're gonna get you out of here in a few minutes. 
 Driver seems okay. He's just a bit shaken up. 
 Yeah, well, this guy was in good enough shape to take off. 
 The guy we almost hit? 
 I guess so. 
 Well, it looks like he ran the stop sign. 
 Yeah. Or maybe he just didn't want to get caught with something. 
 What, like drugs? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay. 
 Not what I expected. 
 Officer Graham to the service desk. 
 So you think we'll be in the wedding party? 
 You know, for Andy and Luke's wedding? 
 I'm not really sure they've thought that far ahead. 
 It all happened pretty fast. 
 I don't know. They bought a house together. 
 It kinda makes sense. 
 Yeah. 
 You and Dex gonna get married? 
 Yeah, no. I'm not really into the whole marriage thing. 
 I am. Totally. I can't wait to have a big family. 
 Well, you don't have to be married to have a family, Chris. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I know. I guess I, um... 
 I guess I just kinda always saw myself, uh, you know, getting married. 
 It's weird, but I kinda can't wait. 
 Excuse me. 
 Does Gail know that? 
 I'm here about the murder, the one in the news. 
 The one in Cabbagetown? 
 That's right. The shooting. 
 Okay. Do you have any information, anything that might be helpful? 
 If I could tell you who the killer was, would that be helpful? 
 Yes. Yes, it would. 
 Well, I stopped at the sign. 
 It was my go. I hit the gas and suddenly, bam! Out of nowhere. 
 Then buddy just takes off. 
 Okay, well, these medics are gonna take you to St. Pat's and get you checked out. 
 Not until I talk to him first. 
 Okay. Anything else? 
 Not your best day either, huh? 
 There they are. That's fantastic. What've we got? 
 I got three human heads... two male, possibly one female. 
 Possibly? 
 You tell me, man. 
 Yeah, no. That... that one's a girl. 
 There's hardly any blood, though. 
 Yeah, it looks like the vics were drained before their heads were removed. 
 Neat freak. 
 Okay, all the witnesses gave, um, the same description... white guy, early 20s, brown hair, brown coat. 
 Same guy we saw fleeing the scene. 
 The car's registered to a Tanya Makin, 619 Seaton Lane. 
 Okay, so, uh, I'm gonna call and see if I can get an I. D. on Peter, Paul, and Mary here. 
 You two go to Seaton, and I'll get a T.A.C. to meet you there with a warrant. 
 Okay. Sounds good. 
 All right. 
 What kind of person cuts people's heads off and drives around with 'em? 
 Day like today, you got two options... either werewolves or zombies. 
 I'd give it to the werewolves. 
 Why? 
 Everybody knows zombies can't drive. 
 Okay, you could've at least let me drive. 
 You wanna drive so badly, take out your own damn squad car. Wait. 
 You're not allowed. 
 Is that how you want to play this? 
 Dov, I'm not playing, okay? I'm just doing my job. 
 Check it out. Up ahead on the left. 
 Do you smell that? 
 What? 
 Sweet redemption. 
 Stay in the car. 
 I got this. 
 That's an order. 
 Numb-nuts! This is the police. Stop fighting now. 
 Don't worry about it! 
 Bravo. Excellent work, Officer Peck. 
 It's last warning, and then I'm gonna tase you. 
 That is 50, 000 volts straight into the junk. 
 I had it. 
 I know. 
 I heard you practicing, remember? 
 Tanya Makin! 
 Police! Hands up! 
 Okay! 
 All clear. 
 Thank you. 
 When's the last time you saw it? 
 I parked it outside on the street last night after my shift. I swear. 
 I thought it was still outside. 
 And where do you work? 
 At the Pump & Grind coffee house on college. 
 Okay, you have no idea who might've taken it? 
 I mean, did you lend it to anyone? 
 No. 
 Husband? 
 No. 
 Yeah, I guess you're a bit young to be married. 
 A lot of boxes, Tanya. 
 You planning on going somewhere? 
 Yeah, I'm supposed to move back to north bay with my parents. 
 My roommate left me a couple weeks ago and stuck me with the rent. 
 Look, I don't know what's going on here, okay? 
 I just know that you guys are busting into my apartment, telling me that my car is gone. 
 I would just really appreciate it if somebody would explain to me what's going on. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah, Jerry, go. 
 No, she's clean. 
 We found some evidence of a crime in your trunk. 
 What? What kind of crime? 
 Well, that's still under investigation. 
 No, no, no, no, no. My laptop got lifted from work last week. 
 That's still under investigation, but I didn't get a visit from a SWAT team. 
 Tanya, you know anybody who works at Victoria Mercy? 
 What, the hospital? 
 Yeah. 
 No, why? 
 Okay. 
 We're good. Thank you. 
 Well, um, a Detective will be in touch with you about your car. 
 Whoa. What, that's it? 
 Well, for now, but, look... 
 In the meantime, if you think of anyone that matches that description we gave you, call, okay? This is my direct line. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 What'd Jerry say? 
 Victoria Mercy's lab reported three cadavers with missing heads. 
 Cadavers? You think they go with the heads we found? 
 I can't believe I just asked you that. 
 Nothing gets by you, does it, McNally? 
 Oh, kinda like the bit about being too young to be married? 
 No. Nothing gets by me. 
 She says she can identify James Cole's shooter... a junkie named Michelle Turner, mid-20s. 
 She even gave us the last known address. 
 And she saw Cole get shot? 
 She says she's a neighbor. 
 What's her name? 
 She wouldn't tell us. 
 She doesn't want to get involved. 
 Okay, so she's willing to give up the shooter by name with no evidence? 
 Guess we brought you a little too soon. 
 Yeah, that's, uh, that's fine. 
 Just try and figure out who she is and see if she has a beef with this Michelle Turner, okay? 
 Will do. 
 Okay. 
 And Detective Callaghan? 
 Yeah. 
 Congratulations, you know, on you and Andy. 
 We're all, uh... we're all really excited for... 
 Thanks. 
 Thought you were staying home today, getting some sleep. 
 Yeah, well, um... I... 
 Yeah. You don't sleep well during the day. 
 Nash and Diaz, uh, may have a witness in the Cole murder. 
 Oh, great. Anything solid? 
 We'll see. 
 That was an absolutely gorgeous ring you gave McNally this morning. 
 Or was that last night? I'm really not clear on the details. 
 Callaghan! Brother. True? False? 
 You locking it down with McNally? 
 Yeah. Yeah, locking it down. 
 Great. 
 How'd you get so lucky? 
 What's this I hear on the wire about three heads in a duffel bag? 
 Yeah, yeah. No. They... they were stolen from the lab at the old Vic. 
 Yeah, I got Sammy down there right now with your fiancée. 
 Yeah, let's just call her McNally. 
 Okay. 
 So I guess we should probably start talking bachelor party. 
 That's my cue. Congratulations, Detective. 
 E121A. 
 Well... 
 These heads... you think it's just some innocent prank? 
 Try using the words severed heads" and innocent" in the same sentence. 
 I really want to hear that one. 
 Shut up. 
 "E110." What, did we pass it? 
 It's E121A. Okay. You go that way. I'll go this way. You can give me a call. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 Excuse me, sir? 
 Sam, I got him. Have you reached... stop! 
 Put your hands up! Put 'em up. 
 What do you want? I'm busy... "McNally. " 
 I just want to talk to you about the car accident this morning, about the car you stole. 
 I didn't steal a car. 
 Yeah, I think you did. Come on. Put your hands up. 
 Why are you lying? I didn't steal anything. 
 Sam, I got him in the lab. 
 Just come get over here right now, 'cause you're... no! 
 I gotta go. 
 McNally! Don't touch me! 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. Just go. Go! 
 Are you sure you're okay? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. 
 What? 
 He bit me. 
 It's fine. Seriously. 
 And you're sure? 
 He didn't even break the skin. 
 Okay, but you start to transform... 
 I ain't gonna think twice. 
 Daniel Baird... one of my research residents. 
 Why would he be stealing the heads off cadavers? 
 I haven't the faintest idea. It makes no sense to me. 
 I mean, he had full access here. 
 He can get in and out anytime? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 When was the last time you saw him? 
 Let's see, uh... He hasn't been in for three shifts, but that's not unusual. 
 I mean, we are a hospital. People do get sick. 
 I just went three rounds with him down the hall. 
 Could he have a drug problem? 
 If you're asking whether he had access to the pharmacy, no. 
 What about friends? 
 I mean... nice guy, social? 
 What do you mean? 
 She means, is he weird? 
 I work 60 hours a week down him by choice I think I'm the wrong person to ask. 
 Okay. 
 Trace. Guess what I found. 
 A list of wedding halls for Andy and Luke? 
 No. I've got an I.D. on our reluctant witness. 
 Go, Chris. 
 Yeah, I checked the security cameras in the lot out front. 
 Guess who came here in her own car. 
 Oh, no, she didn't. 
 Yeah. Ran the plates. 
 She lives in Hamilton. 
 Hamilton? 
 So she's no neighbor? 
 No, not even close. 
 Her name's Cecile Edwards. 
 Edwards? 
 Yeah. 
 There's definitely a connection between Cecile Edwards and Michelle Turner, the woman she I.D.'d as the shooter. 
 Cecile Edwards is her mother. 
 Were you even gonna tell me? 
 Jo, I do not need to ask your permission to marry Andy. 
 Well, you do when you give her my ring. 
 It was never your ring. 
 You said no. 
 Yeah, and yet you hung on to it all these years. 
 I mean, something you were gonna give me. 
 Something you're now giving... have given... to some doe-eyed little rookie. 
 She found it. 
 All right? 
 She found it, which is great by me. 
 The only thing that mattered in that was her answer, not where the ring came from. 
 Of course it matters. 
 You wanted different things, and I respected that, but you do not get to come in here now and do this because I am happy with someone who's not you. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Clean slate. 
 Is this the Michelle Turner? 
 Yes. That's... that's her. 
 That's the girl that did the shooting. 
 Mrs. Edwards, w... we know that... 
 Michelle Turner is your daughter. 
 So? 
 She still went out with that Cole boy, and he got her hooked... on drugs, and they fought all the time, and I'm sure... I'm sure she killed him. 
 Ma'am, uh, we checked with Hamilton P.D., and we know... that you filed a missing persons report 18 months ago on Michelle. 
 Is she still missing? 
 Look, that report... it sat on the desk inactive... for almost a year. 
 She's 27 years old. 
 She worked on the street, and they tell me she has a high score. 
 She's low priority. 
 I just figured if... if I told you that she did something bad like murdered, you would go out and look for her like she was important. 
 So what does this mean? 
 That nobody's gonna do anything, right? 
 I'm a... 
 I'm afraid if she's got nothing to do with the case, then... 
 I won't waste your time any more. 
 Ms. Edwards. 
 We're gonna print out your daughter's file, okay? 
 You can read through it, and if there is anything that you can think of, just go ahead and write it down. 
 I mean, maybe there's something that we missed. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. Okay. Have a seat. 
 What'd the super say? 
 Quiet. Keeps to himself. Pays his rent on time. Typical psycho stuff. 
 Daniel? 
 It's the police. 
 God. 
 Looks like Dov and Chris's place. 
 Well, Dov's half, anyway. 
 Except for maybe this. 
 And those. 
 They definitely don't have those. 
 Brains? That's gross. 
 Clozapine. 
 What's clozapine? 
 Anti-psychotics. 
 So Daniel's schizophrenic? 
 I guess so. 
 These are dated from a month ago. Still full. 
 So what's he want with brains? 
 I don't know, and I doubt it would make much sense to us, anyway, but, I do suggest we figure out where he is, before he decides to cut the head off somebody who isn't already dead. 
 There's something happening inside that bag... spray paint, illegal fireworks. 
 Those guys? No way. 
 There's way too much apathy going on over there for pyrotechnics. 
 Weed. 
 We don't have cause. 
 I can find cause. Gail, I need to make an arrest, all right? 
 No. 
 You know, this power trip isn't gonna make me want you as a roommate any more than I already don't. 
 Whatever. I pay my share of the rent now. 
 Chris wants me there, so you're just gonna have to man up and deal with it. 
 I will. 
 Only 'cause I can wait you out. 
 Wait. You think that Chris and I aren't gonna last? 
 Actually, I don't know how you lasted this long. 
 I mean, you guys have nothing in common with each other. 
 Chris is a totally good person. 
 And I'm not? 
 I don't know. You tell me. 
 Why'd you volunteer to be my partner today? 
 To mess with me? To kick me while I'm down? 
 Dov, I volunteered to be your partner today, because nobody else wanted you. 
 Do you think you're impressing the T.O.S with this whole dive in headfirst" thing? 
 You're not. 
 You're just proving you're not ready. 
 What exactly am I looking for? 
 For something with an address. 
 Something that gives us an idea where he might hide out when he's not here. 
 I got a Jim and Dina Baird. Bend, Oregon. 
 A long way from home. 
 Yeah, with nobody to check up on him. 
 Check this out. 
 This is Daniel. 
 Yeah, this is one week at half a dose, so... things are good. 
 Things are a little bit clearer, less fog. 
 Nine days, off of medication, and, I think things are good. 
 I've just probably been going to the coffee shop a little too much, which is... which is... which is understandable, so, uh... headaches are a problem. They're consistent, and appetite has pretty much gone. 
 I need to, uh... not go down the road of the d2 receptors. That's... not possible. 
 Jeez. 
 If you can complete the circles in the right direction and you can complete... the communication between them all, that's... that's when things start to fire properly. 
 Sound like he was trying to cure himself. 
 And if you don't have that... 
 A transplant. 
 The brain doesn't function properly. 
 I'm lucky. 
 Remember Tanya saying that her laptop was stolen? 
 Well, the coffee house where she works is between here and the hospital. 
 Tanya. It's Officer McNally. Give me a call as soon as you get this, okay? 
 I... I... 
 Lock your doors, and don't go anywhere. We're on our way. 
 Yeah, I was getting to that. 
 You know, it's really not that kid's fault. 
 I mean, he's just trying to get better. He can't control it. 
 That kid stole heads. He was diagnosed, prescribed medication. 
 He chose to go off his medication. In my book, that makes him responsible. 
 Yeah, but he didn't ask for this to happen. 
 McNally, things happen to us all the time. 
 It doesn't mean we can't choose how we react. 
 Is this you trying to be subtle again? 
 Is that Tanya? 
 No, it's Luke. 
 You've reached Andy. Leave me a message after the beep. 
 It's me. I'm home early. I'll see you when you get here. 
 The door's open. 
 Police! We're coming in! 
 Tanya! 
 This is the police! 
 Tanya, it's Officer McNally! 
 Please, no! Is he gone?! Is he gone?! 
 He's gone. He's gone. We're clear! 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. 
 I just came home, and he was here. He was here in my living room. 
 Daniel Baird? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I recognized him from work. He comes in all the time. 
 I mean, he's a little weird, but usually he's pretty sweet, you know? 
 He just kept saying that he... that I didn't have to leave him, that he was gonna... he just needed more time. 
 Did he hurt you? 
 No, I hit him over the head with this... this lamp, and then... and then... and then I heard your car, and I told him that the police were coming, and then he took the phone out of my hand, and he... and he chucked... oh, my God. He chucked it against the wall. 
 Okay. Just calm down. Take a breath. You're safe now. 
 Any idea where he went? 
 No, I don't have any idea where he went. 
 I ran upstairs, and I locked myself in the bathroom. 
 He just kept screaming. He kept screaming that the police were trying to poison my mind and that they didn't want us to be together. 
 And you... he even knew who you were. 
 I mean, he kept screaming your name, like, "McNally, McNally, McNally, McNally!" 
 And, like, and then he was gonna find you, and he was gonna stop your lies. 
 What's your name? 
 Luke. 
 Luke Callaghan. What's yours? 
 I'm Daniel. Daniel Baird. 
 Does McNally live here? 
 Andy McNally? 
 She's not home right now, Daniel. 
 What can I do for you? 
 She's lying, and... she's ruining everything. 
 Okay, let's talk about that, all right? 
 I can fix it. 
 Tanya doesn't have to know. 
 Tanya? No, no. She doesn't. All right? 
 I... I'll tell her that, Daniel. 
 She doesn't have to know anything, all right? 
 You're police. 
 Yeah. 
 Daniel, I'm a Detective. I'm Luke Callaghan. 
 1519, we've got a noise complaint in your area. 952 Armstrong. 
 May I? 
 Yeah. 
 Dispatch, mark 1519. We're on it. 
 Dov. 952's over here. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Dov. Seriously. 
 Can I talk to you for a second? 
 You seen anything unusual tonight? 
 Replace the superior gyrus 4 cc's cerebrospinal fluid. 
 Have you been drinking, sir? 
 Drinking? No. No. 
 You're the police. 
 What gave it away? 
 Sir, I'm gonna need to see some I. D. 
 So the car's gonna take you to the station, keep you safe until we've located Daniel. 
 Okay. 
 Look, I don't understand. Why me? 
 You were nice to him at the coffee shop, and he thinks he was in love with you. 
 So wait. Wait. When he said he needed more time, what did... what's he gonna do? 
 He's trying to fix himself. 
 Maybe that way you'll love him back. 
 That's crazy. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you need some medical attention? 
 You don't know what it's like when you're out at night. 
 I need you to focus and talk to me. 
 Are you hurt? 
 I... I just... I gotta go. 
 I don't have a lot of time. 
 Sir, I need you to calm down. This will just take a minute. 
 Dispatch? 
 What is she doing over there? 
 Who is she talking to? 
 Mark 1519. 
 We have a 20 on E.D.P. Daniel Baird. 
 I'm strung between Dupont and Bloor. 
 That's... that's our street. That's where we live. 
 I gotta go. I don't... I don't have a lot of time. I need to finish it. 
 Finish? Finish what, Daniel? 
 Officer Epstein? 
 Subject is K.T.P... . 51-50 with a 10-60. 
 Daniel, I'm gonna need you to put your hands above your head now. 
 I gotta go. I need to fix it. 
 Put the gun down. 
 We need you to put your gun down! 
 I need to fix it. I need to fix it for her. 
 No, put it down, Daniel, please. 
 Stay down! 
 I got him. 
 We got him. Sir, don't move. 
 The guy had this. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That's Luke's gun. 
 Luke! Luke! Oh, my God. Luke. 
 It's me, Andy. He's down! 
 10-33. Officer down. 926A Armstrong. 
 All right. So, okay, he's breathing. 
 Cloths. Get some cloths from the kitchen. 
 Cloths! McNally! Get some cloths or towels or whatever... from the kitchen, all right? 
 He's still alive. 
 10-33! Officer down! 926A Armstrong! We need a bus! 
 What do I do? 
 That's good. 
 All right. Just put... apply pressure there. That's it. 
 Okay. It's gonna be all right. 
 Sam. 
 Just look at me, all right? 
 It's gonna be fine. He's still alive. 
 Just stay with me, all right? 
 He's been in there a really long time. 
 He's in the best possible hands. 
 Yeah. 
 Have you heard anything? 
 No. 
 We've got Daniel Baird sedated. 
 Found this on him. 
 Must've looked you up. 
 Yeah, well, um... 
 Luke put the house in both of our names, so... 
 How did he get in? 
 Looks like he came in through the back gate. 
 There was no lock, so... 
 How is he? 
 We got the bullets out, but, uh, he lost a lot of blood. 
 The next 48 hours are critical. 
 Can I see him? 
 Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I.C.U. is restricted. Family only. 
 I'm his fiancée. I am his family. 
 All right. Come on. 
 Sorry, boys. 
 You need this bathroom, too? 
 I just want to see if you're okay. 
 I'm fine. 
 Dov... 
 How did you know? 
 I don't... I don't know. 
 I just... something seemed off, so I dove in. 
 It's the only way I know how to do this job. 
 I'm gonna be outside. 
 I spoke to my staff sergeant, and he said we could put out another priority one bulletin on your daughter in the morning. 
 Thank you. 
 I promise, we won't forget about her. 
 Then if you don't mind, can I go over it one more time? 
 Go ahead. 
 I just heard. 
 Luke's out of surgery, but they still don't know. 
 I know. 
 So the eyewitness story was bogus? 
 She's just a mom trying to do what she has to do for her kid. 
 Doesn't always make sense. 
 Sure it does. 
 Family comes first. Can't argue with that. 
 Okay. I gotta go to the hospital in a bit. You want me to, uh put a second pair of eyes on that? 
 That'd be great. 
 All right.
