 (Sirens wailing in distance) 
 Man : You five are under arrest! Hands behind your back! 
 Cuff 'em, boys! Make it hurt! 
 (Indistinct shouting) 
 Man : Come on! Keep them like that! (Grunts) 
 Chris Diaz! 
 Traci Nash. 
 Gail Peck. 
 Dov Epstein. 
 What the hell? 
 And Andy McNally. 
 You have the right to shut up. 
 You have the right to remain calm, and you have the right to get out of these handcuffs any way you know how! 
 (Cheering) 
 (Miss TK and The Revenge's "No biterz" playing) 
 Whoo! 
 First rookie out of their cuffs drinks for free. 
 Man : Yeah! 
 Everyone else pays! 
 (Cheering) 
 Are you ready? 
 Yeah! 
 On your mark, get set, go to town! 
 ♪ No biterz ♪ 
 Steve, Steve! I happen to know that my brother has an extra key. Give me they key. 
 Man : You can put 'em on, you gotta be able to get 'em off. 
 You have to... come on. 
 Man : Partner it up, partner it up! 
 What is going on here, Peck? 
 I'm not doing anything. (Screams) 
 Ohh! 
 (Screaming continues) 
 (Laughs) 
 Yeah! 
 Unbelievable! 
 Ladies and gentlemen, meet the rookies of 15 division!

 Oh, this bar bill's gonna cost me a fortune. 
 I know. Your entire allowance. 
 Andy, you were robbed. 
 Mm, yeah, by the cheater. Robo-cheater. 
 You know what? 
 He said any way you know how anyway, so whatever. 
 I love this job so much, you know? 
 It's funny, but I love all these guys so much. 
 You don't even know them. 
 It doesn't matter we're already brothers. 
 I feel that, brotha. 
 And... and sisters. 
 And sisters. Right there. 
 How about officers? 
 Officers. 
 Yeah. 
 Officers, yeah! 
 Officers. Officers. 
 (One Republic's playing) 
 So here we are. 
 We've spent the last few months together training to do this job. 
 We've learned how to shoot and fight and drive a police car really fast. 
 I mean, we're ready. 
 I mean, they keep telling us we don't know anything. 
 Man : It doesn't matter... 
 That it doesn't matter how well we did at the academy. 
 That you might be a legacy and think you know the job inside and out. Maybe you're hip to the street. 
 Maybe you can shoot a paper target from a mile away. 
 It actually doesn't matter. There is absolutely no training that prepares you for life on the street. And on that cautionary note, welcome to 15. Serve, protect... And don't screw up. Nope. Of course not. You're a frickin' machine. Traci, we get in the car. They drive us around. I mean, anything happens, they tell us what to do. I know what to do. I spent three months at the academy preparing myself for exactly what to do. Ready for anything. Ready for anything. Chris Diaz. Six beers, two whiskeys and a stack of brand-new divorce papers. Uh... sir? Last night's scorecard. Means I'm not exactly overflowing with patience, team spirit, thrill of the job. Shall we? Uh, uh, yeah, guess I'm going. Man : Okay, so I'll see you later, all right? Hi. Great. I get Jenny from the block. That is not coming in my car. What was your name again? McNally, sir. McNally, and as in... Andy McNally. Either one's fine. Okay, well, thanks for the update, Andy McNally. Let's go. Okay. Oh. The bag? In the back. (Indistinct police radio chatter) You know, people can smell new cops like they can smell fresh paint. You look new. You sound new. We are new. I know. I know. That's my point. That's why we have to have the talk. What talk? The don't embarrass me, your radio is on the wrong side of your belt, uh, do as I say, not as I do" talk. Woman : We have a trouble unknown 306 Dunn Avenue near Jameson and King. Is there a unit available to attend? Hey, that's right over there. Yeah, 306 is a hole. I was there twice last week for drunk and disorderly. We're gonna let Noelle take that one, and you and I are gonna go have a coffee. We're gonna continue to have the talk. Okay. 1519. Are you 10-8 yet? Can you take the call? Terrific. Go ahead. It's the black button. 1519... The other black button. Oh. 1519, 10-4. Are you happy? Okay, let's hit it. (Tires screech) (Siren wailing) I called you all about 15 minutes ago. Okay. Hi. Hi. Okay, uh, tell me what's happening. It's apartment 202. Uh-huh. It's bad enough in there without people yelling and screaming. Okay. Um, McNally, get out of the car. Okay. So people are yelling. A couple of guys in there. They're going at each other. Uh-huh. It's like freakin' pit bulls, man. Ok, wait a second, they are like pit bulls or they have pit bulls? Man, I don't know... (Girl) Are you a policeman? Uh, you know, woman. Officer. Policewoman/officer. Yeah, I mean, well, yes. Can I see your gun? Oh, I'm sorry. It's really dangerous, okay? You have to be... (Gunshots) Ma'am. 1519. We have shots fired at 306 Dunn. Calling for backup. Come on. Let's go. Let's go! Now! (Dogs barking) (Door creaks) Stay right behind me. You cover me. Don't shoot me in the back. Whoa! Sir, get back inside. Close your door. 1519. We're on the first floor, about to head up the front stairs, (woman) 1505. We're almost there. Sir? Sir, gunshots fired. Shouldn't we wait for backup? We got little kids in this building. You want to wait for backup, you go ahead. You knock yourself out. (Child crying in distance) (Sirens wailing) (Tires screech) (Indistinct police radio chatter) So I just follow you in, right? Gun in, gun out? Really? Sorry. 1519. We're at apartment 202. We're going in. (Lowers voice) Tug up, tug up. Okay? Ready to go? Yeah. Police. Don't move! Hands in the air! Do it now! Okay, they're gone. They're gone! Cover them. Okay. He... Mink's over there. He's... he's... All right, Sadie. Sadie, relax. Relax. (Sadie) Okay. Keep your hands up. Don't move. Okay. Oh, God. Uh... (Panting) Okay, okay. Sir? Um... Dispatch, I have one victim, V.S.A., shot in the chest. Just stay there. Have responding units seal the building. Notify homicide and ident. Woman : Copy. Sir? Sir! What? I think we got an O.D. She's barely breathing. I wouldn't touch her with a 10-foot pole. You... you wait for the medics. She's just a kid. Get up. All units, apartment 202 is clear. -Sadie, I gotta cuff you. Okay. Now let's plug it in, okay? (Handcuffs clicking) You gotta tell me exactly... exactly what happened. I don't know, 'cause I wasn't in here. Oh, yeah? Well, that's funny, because you know what? You're supposed to be in jail. I'm on probation. (Exhales) (Whispering) One, two, three, four, five... Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Come on. We're really just supposed to sit here? I'm on the phone. We're missing all the action. (Speaks indistinctly, giggles) Uh, excuse me. Sir? Hi. Uh, quick question. Uh, I was wondering, uh, how would I, and would I be allowed to... Spit it out. Oh. Uh, can I take my gun home with me at night? Why? You know, just to, uh, to have it, to get used to it, to clean it. Take-home forms are in the second drawer. You fill one out, then I decide. Thank you, sir. Big man. Yes, I am. Man : Officer Peck to booking. I need a P.W. to do a search. P.W.... Great. Policewoman. Congratulations. Ahh. Thank you very much. (Door beeps) Sir. Picked her up at St. Joe's, stealing drugs from the nurse's station. Get her tombstone I.D., search her, put her in a cell. Sarge is on his way. What? I can't search a lady. (Door buzzes, beeps) (Door closes) Okay, uh...? Tabby Barnes. I'm 34. I live at 930 Church Street, apartment 1-D, and I'm innocent, by the way. No, I... yeah, I'm sure you are. Uh, do you have any injuries, Tabby? Are you on any medication? Finasteride, spironolactone, premarin, estroegene, estradiol. Hormones. I'm transgendered. Not bad, huh? No, it's... it's not... no, not bad at all. I'm gonna be right back. She's a chick. No. You're saying that... Dov, she's not a chick. She's a man. I'm not a man. I'm transgendered. Can you please explain to us exactly what that means? I mean, if... if you're a dude, I could search you. And if not, Gail would be delighted. (Door beeps) You search her. You book her. It's not rocket science. It's some kind of science. Sorry. Got a wallet? Ah. Tabor Barnes. "M" for male. I'm sorry, sir. I just haven't updated it. Epstein, you're up. Okay. (Sirens wailing) (Indistinct police radio chatter) Go ahead. Contain the perimeter. What about the people inside? They're all possible witnesses. So contain 'em. Don't let 'em out. Should I start taking statements? Yeah, sure. You can start by taking mine. You read here it is. Put up the tape. Sit on your radio. Man : 1509. We got some movement in the bushes back here. Oh, hey. Thanks for joining. We were looking for the shooter, but we... Shut it. We were looking for the shooter. Woman : Thought she wasn't breathing. She wasn't, but I gave her mouth-to-mouth. Ew. Let's get Courtney love out of here, 'cause the guy in there is not going anywhere. You sure? I got healing powers. That's what I hear. Kiss it better. Kiss it better. (Gasps) According to our friend Sadie here, Victim's name is Mink Barker... well-known drug dealer. (Gasps) Came in with a friend. Right now that's our suspect. He's a white male, greasy black hair, black t-shirt, and he is probably long gone. McNally, Nash, we need you guys to clear the rest of the house. No one leaves. Contain the premises. Okay. Yeah, be careful. Don't get lost. Go. Go. (Pen clicks) So what, we just... we start lookin'? Yeah, start at the top, work our way dow (Door creaks) And, uh, shooter could still be in the building, so guns drawn. Fake it till you make it. Uh... You scared? No. Are you? No. Yeah, right. All right. Ready? Okay. You take the door on the other end of this. Okay. Police! Open up! Police! Open up! Excuse me, ma'am. I just need to take a look at the premises. Uh... (Men speaking indistinctly) Police! Open up! (Men continue speaking indistinctly) That is a crappy lock. Don't move. Put your hands up. I said don't move! Stay where you are! See ya. No, I... stop! Here we go. You... (Andy) I said don't move! Or what? Traci! Uh, Andy McNally. I'm on the third floor. I've got two guys running down the fire escape. Uh, one of them matches the subject's description. Anybody on the ground? Traci! Oh! Guys, I'm running down the fire escape. I'm in pursuit of a suspect... black t-shirt, greasy hair. (Tires screech) Oh! Oh! Sir, this is a crime scene. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn this thing around. Detective? Homicide. Help yourself. Andy? Dude? Where are you? (Clatter) Andy? (Under breath) Okay, if I am being hazed right now... Police! Don't move! (Dog barking, car alarm wailing in distance) Man : Okay, look, I'm sorry. I... I wasn't thinking. Backup. 352 Dunn. Man : What was I supposed to do? (Man speaking indistinctly) Okay, okay, calm down. Police! Don't move! Put your hands up right now! Hurry up! Now! Put 'em against the fence, both of you. Aw, come on. I don't... I don't believe this. Sir, be quiet. (Grunts) Oh! Aah! Don't move! Get back to the fence right now! You don't want to do this. Shut up. Turn over. I'm serious. You gotta trust me, okay? No, I'm serious. You shut up. Resisting arrest. Fleeing the scene. Ohh. (Groans) Oh. Possession. Ow, ow, ow! Where's the gun, huh? I don't have a gun. I'm on the job. Not anymore. Get up. Come on, get up. Aah. That hurts. Go. Let's go. Okay, okay. Thank you. (Indistinct conversations, dog barking) Sir. I've been trying to radio you. Yeah? Here, turn around. Ah, see? Try turning it on. (Radio beeps) (Indistinct police radio chatter) Listen, I've made a couple of arrests. They're in the back of the car. Arrests? Yeah. For what? Fleeing the scene. Possession. One guy matches the subject description. Really? (Chuckles) Okay. Yeah, let's get 'em back to the barn, yeah. I'm starving. Uh, you know, because you said don't let anybody leave the scene... I know what I said. What do you want, a cookie? (Grunts) Man : 1503, do you copy? Amazing. What? Nothing. No, that's... that's... that's good work. Thanks. Yeah. Let's book these bad boys. You know, I just got out of ladies' prison. You're the first man that I've touched in three months. Diaz, meet Sadie Falls. She's a witness. She just got out of prison. Take her statement and search her. Yes, sir. Will do. Okay, ma'am. Come with me. Okay. Well, he doesn't live here... not a chance. Look at his running shoes... top of the line. 150 bucks easy. Calling children's aid. (Beep) You better start talking, young man. Okay, Joe, you gotta start talking to me, okay? I can't. How come? I promised. You promised who? You can tell me. I was playing a game. Mm-hmm. And in the game, you're s... you're supposed to stay in the closet until he comes and finds you. Until who comes and finds you? Are you saying you saw a different guy come into the apartment? No, I'm saying that I'm not gonna tell you anything else until you promise to help me out of here. Ma'am, according to the criminal code, you are under legal obligations to report everything you saw in there. You are adorable. Hey, Frank. (Chuckles) Frank? What's the problem? No, it's just I can't, like, make a deal with a rookie. So make a deal with me. Tell me what you saw. No harm, no foul. You're not gonna write me up? Okay. Kid came in. He was looking for Mink. He was real pissed off. He was a, uh, uh, a skinny guy, um, brown hair, orange t-shirt. About five minutes later, the gun went off. I was in the other room. Sweetie, I swear to God, I didn't see what happened. I didn't see what happened, I swear. Okay. Okay, okay. But, sir, the manual says that you have to... "But, sir, the manual says... " Listen, she was withholding evidence. Yeah, from you. Look, rook, sometimes you gotta give a little to get a little, all right? All right. Give him the statement. I can I.D. the guy. Let's get these guys processed. Now, McNally, you got that guy. Come on. Let's go. Move it. Good stuff. Good stuff. 
 
 (Door buzzes and beeps) Okay. I am gonna get this guy into a holding cell. Don't we have to book him first? Yeah, usually. That's cool, officers. I'll take it from here. Nice work. You know what's not cool? I said that I got him. No, I... Uh, where's Jeff? Who the hell are you? Hey, Sam. Buddy. I can't believe the drug squad's giving you back. Welcome home. I mean, 'cause I haven't... I haven't seen you here since I put you away. You're a cop? A cop? Man : Are you serious? No. Shut up. What the hell is he doing here? I was trying to get him into a holding cell. Maybe a little heads-up would be in order. (Speaking at once) How could you? Shut up! Everybody, shut up. Sorry, buddy. Sorry. (Handcuffs click) (Door buzzes and beeps) (Door creaks close) Sam, I'm so sorry. I... (Laughs) What do you think? I'm standing there dressed like a punk. I'm in cuffs. Many would assume I'm still undercover. Sir, it was my fault. She's a rook. She's not supposed to be running around on her own. Sam, I know. It got kinda stretched out. I asked her to clear the house. And he matched the description. I arrested him, but I didn't know. I... I told you, "don't do this. You're makin' a mistake." Okay, well, everybody says that, don't they? Is that what they say? Why didn't you just tell me you were working undercover? I told you I was on the job. I couldn't exactly break it down for you. My guy was right there... biggest mouth on the street, which is why he's my guy. Eight months. Eight months undercover, living in a hole, cultivating informants... Okay, well, I'm sorry. Finally getting people... finally getting people to talk to me, and some Bambi comes along first day, arrests a cop from her own division, trying to be a hero. Thanks, pal. Friends forever. (Sniffles) All right, little man. You see this quarter? If you can guess what hand it's in, you can keep it. But be careful. I'm a magician. No, I'm telling you, I've got a key. It's one of the fancy keys at 60 bucks a pop. Can't get 'em duplicated without a code. In... my... sleeve. (Coin clatters) No, I don't have the code, but there's a number on the key. It... Okay, buddy, look at your caller I.D. Yeah, it says police. Do you want know why? 'Cause I'm the frickin' police, and I'm telling you that I need an address. Booking's that way. Uh, she's a witness to a homicide who has definitely not breached probation. We, uh, you still need to search her... Carefully. You can search me. Oh, and, uh, Frank says to make her cough. You know, just in case she's got, um, drugs up the... the ying-yang. I am the frickin' police, and I have an address for Joe! Man : Yay. Yes! (Bang) (Banging continues) Is that working for you, huh? All the slamming and banging? I mean, I get your point. What are you doing in here? I'm being persistent. You know, I have nothing else going for me today, so, you know, when in doubt... I don't like girl guides. I don't like being raked over coals for not knowing the secret handshake. You know, console yourself. I'll probably be fired. You know what? There's still a dead guy lying in that house. Oh, and there's another guy running free and clear with a gun. So whenever you feel like this is out of your system, maybe you'd care to act like a cop for five minutes. (Laughing) I've only been a cop for five minutes. (Bag zips) What do you know? (Clattering sounds) What do you got? Victim's name is Mink Barker. Whoo! Mink Barker. If it's Mink Barker, happy birthday. It was a big surprise. King of bad dope. King of pain. You got half a neighborhood who'd love to see the creep dead. Guy's a sleazebag. Deals... deals a ton  - of junk at street level, none of it's good. Hold on a sec. There's good junk? Yeah, there's heroin that hasn't been cut with rat poison, cut glass, other drugs, you name it. We've had seven O.Ds in three weeks... it's all Barker's stuff. Now he's dead. Karma's a bitch. Okay. So then what about the gunman? I mean, apparently he came in with some other guy... you know, greasy black hair. That's why I thought it was you. (Sighs) That's Mike Kowalchuk. He's a weasel, but he doesn't have a gun and he doesn't have the balls, and this is gel, by the way. So, uh, what about the kid in the orange t-shirt? I don't know who you're talking about. Heard the shots, looked out the window, saw a couple of kids taking off down the fire escape. One of 'em ran into an empty building. It's a good place to hide a gun. Okay, which empty building? You know, the one right near where you tackled me, tried to kiss me. (Giggles) Did you guys find the gun? (Sighs) Did you even look for a gun? Well, if you saw the kid take off, why didn't you chase after him? (Sighs) Lady, I was playing a drug addict. Couldn't go down and chase him without blowing my cover. Not like it matters now. Do you mind? Hey, we need to go back to the house. (Mouth full) We don't need to do anything, okay? I don't even want to have the talk anymore. Yeah, but I just got some more information,  (mouth full) And we need need to to relay it to homicide. I talked to the undercover guy. (Chuckles) Fine. You drive. I'll digest. Okay. (Keys jangling) Dude... It's probation" with an o"... (Clicks computer key) Not pra-bation." (Typing) How was I supposed to know you're allowed to make a deal with a junkie? Uh, rock, paper, scissors... homicide trumps all. Now we know. I swear to God. It takes 15 minutes to pee with this thing on. W... where's Joe? Man : Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Well, you need to fire that babysitter. Yeah, yeah, I already did. I left her, like, ten messages. Yeah, yeah, babysitter's a her"? Excuse me? Well, it's just that's what Joe kept saying... "now how's he gonna find me?" He says it's a game you guys play. He said that? I mean, 'cause that's a hell of a game... leaving your 8-year-old kid in a closet... in a crack house.... after a homicide. Look, I told you... he was with his sitter. Yeah, I'm just gonna give her a call before you leave. Just make sure your stories line up. Joe, you want to, uh, just take a seat for a second? How long have you been using? What? (Scoffs) Sir, the officer asked you a question. I heard the question. Honestly, I don't know what you're talking about, okay? Really? Hmm. Number's out of service. (Whispers) All right. If I put myself there, and right where you are, I get it. You know I do. But what I do not get is how you left him. I mean, you just left him there alone. I didn't. I... I didn't leave him alone. I, uh... I went back three times. The place was closed off. I, uh... (Scoffs) I couldn't get in. Yeah. Sir, you should go talk to your son. (Man whispers) I'm so sorry. According to Swarek, it's not Mike Kowalchuk, why? Uh, he said, "because he's a weasel, but he doesn't have the balls or a gun." And Swarek was up there? Yeah, he was on the third floor and said he saw a guy in an orange shirt run down the fire escape and go into the building over there. You know, I can go take a look right now. I... if you find anything, don't touch it, huh? Just call me. I'll send in forensics. Okay. I'll walk you. All right. I hear you arrested him. Sam Swarek? Yeah, I did. I feel like an idiot. It's not your fault. Another context, it's actually pretty impressive. Luke Callaghan. Andy McNally. Um, yeah, my Dad worked homicide, too. Oh. So you work out of headquarters? No, I'm the lead investigator on the Zoe Martinelli task force, have been for two years. Cool. She was a rookie cop killed in 15, so I work out of 15. Oh. So I guess I'll see you. I mean, I'll... I'll definitely see you if I find anything. Um, actually, I'll probably be right back. I'll be here. Okay. Ooh. (Mocking) "So I guess I'll see you." Okay. (Dog barking) (Clatter) (Clatter) (Pigeons cooing) (Glass shatters) Oh, God! (Inhales sharply) Oh! (Whispers) Oh, crap. (Children shouting in distance) Oh! (Inhales sharply) Don't move! Oka... hi. I said don't move! All right, put your hands in the air. All right. All right. And get down on the ground! (Panting) Wow, you'd make a really good cop. Reach down and take out the cuffs. Okay. Come on! Take them out! Take them out! Put them on! Cuff yourself! Come on! Okay! All right. (Panting) (Handcuffs clanking) (Handcuffs click shut) Don't you just tell me what your name is, okay? What you doing with that gun? I... I found it. It... it was here, okay? Yeah, I know. I came in here to look for it. Man : McNally, what's your 20? I said don't move! Okay! Sorry, it's a habit, all right? Well, it's not really a habit yet 'cause I'm new, but I'm trying to make it a habit, 'cause it's... it's important, so... (Panting) I'm gonna get a few shots in here. Why don't you go upstairs and get some shots out that second-floor window? Hey, Luke? Yeah? Have you seen my rookie? She's not answering her radio. Go easy on her. It's her first day. Yeah. McNally, what's your 20? She's outside, looking for evidence. Aw, come on, pal. You think that's for real? Swarek's really pissed off. That's a payback goose chase if I've ever seen one. Well, that's where she is. (Sighs) Well, you know where I am. Listen, um... tell me why you, uh... you shot the guy in the... in the other room, huh? What, you were... you were in there? (Sighs) Yeah. You and who else? Uh, there was, um, my... my training officer and a... a prostitute, um... There was a girl on the floor. She was overdosing. (Panting) Uh... a couple... other people. What happened to her? What happened to the... (Gulps) girl on the floor? She's okay. She's okay. She's, um, she's breathing. She didn't die. She's at the hospital right now. (Panting) Hey, I wouldn't even think about running, okay? There's a lot of cops out there. Okay? So why don't you just tell me what happened, okay? You can't be... can't be 18, so everything is go. You're gonna be okay. I can help you. All right? Hey, I told you to stay down, all right?! All right. All right. (Panting) (Handcuff slick open) Don't move! All right, please don't move. Any sudden movements, and I gotta pull the trigger. That's procedure. Actually, technically, I should have done it already. Come on. Just please put the gun down, okay? Slowly. Put the gun down. Come on, man! Okay, please don't make me shoot you. This is my first day. I'm begging you, please! Come on. Come on. I'm begging you. Come on. I can help you, okay? (Panting) Just put it down. (Whispers) Come on. (Crying) She's 15. (Normal voice)Who? My sister. The... the girl inside. And she was just laying there... Yeah? And she wasn't moving. Okay, okay. It all happened so fast. That guy... the... What guy? The g... What guy? Drug dealer? I thought she was dead. I kept asking him, "wh... what happened? Tell me what she took." Then he just laughed like it funny. He said... he said it was her fault, said he was leaving her there. Leaving her there on the floor like a piece of garbage! I know. It was her fault, and you... and you... stop him from leaving. You stopped him from leaving, right? And then you came in here and you hid the gun. And now you just came back for the gun, right? (Sobbing) I still didn't mean to do it. I know. Come on. I'm sorry, man. It's okay. I'm sorry. I gotta do this, though, all right? (Whispers) It's okay. (Handcuffs click) Okay. (Exhales deeply) Okay. (Exhales deeply) Okay. Let's go, okay? (Exhales deeply) (Great lake swimmers' "there is a light" playing) I called the hospital and, uh... That guy's little sister... she made it. Good. Good, that's great. Yeah, you should probably tell him. Yeah. No, what's great is that her blood work is clear. All right, you still have to get tested, okay? Yeah. Well, I, uh, I used to work with a guy named McNally. Oh. Uh, long time ago. He was my training officer for awhile, but he... kind of... I... Well, I heard that he hit a rough patch awhile back, but, uh... but he was always a good guy. Yeah, he is. Yeah, anyway, I just wanted to say that, uh... "Fresh paint" line from before? That was his. I don't know if he got it from a book or... You know, either way, it was his first. I just, uh... I don't know. I just... I always liked it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Luke? (Knocks on door) Yeah. Thanks. Hi. Quite a day. Yeah. This is the second of... 20. 4 or 5. 20? Okay. And one more, please? Woman : Coming up. Officer. Detective. Let me know when you're leaving. I'll drive you home. Uh, thank you, but, uh, I got plans tonight. Hey. Thanks for the tip today. Worked out pretty good. Yeah. So can I buy you a drink... say thank you or apologize? Anton Hill... you know who he is? No. 70% of the heroin that comes into city comes through Anton, when he's not pimping little girls for fun. I was undercover eight months. I was two weeks away from arresting the guy. I'm glad you got your collar, but I think I'll buy my own drinks tonight. (Whispers) Okay. Hey, another day, another dirtbag. What is it Boyko was saying? Um... serve, protect, and... And don't screw up. How was I supposed to know he's undercover, huh? I mean, it's a compliment, really. Isn't it? (Laughs) (Dov) Who cares? You caught that kid. You brought him out all by yourself. Handcuffs, murder weapon? Rock 'n' roll, McNally. (Laughs) (All) Yeah, right? (Traci imitating Andy) "Yeah, Traci, it's our first day. We don't have to do anything but sit there, and they'll just drive us around." (Laughing) Oh, shut up. 26... 25... (Siren wailing in distance) Six... Five... Four... Three... (Thud) Two... One! Zero minutes. Hello, my... Hi! Mmm. (Kiss) Mmm. Dad, hey. Hey. (Sniffs) So? How was it? (Sighs) It was good. It was terrible. I don't know. I don't know. You gonna be... you gonna be okay? Oh, yeah. I'll be fine. (inhales deeply) Ah, first days are always the best. New boots, new badge. Whole world smells like fresh paint. You've been set on earth to keep it that way. Thought it was the rookies that smelled like fresh paint. Ah, you're gonna be fine. 'Cause you're the real deal, unlike your old man, who's a total catastrophe. I've been, uh... (Whispers) Dad. (Sighs) Keep it in the family. You remember... you're Andy McNally, and you're gonna be great.
