 I never got why people would spend Saturday night lining up. 
 What are you kidding me? 
 A sick D.J., a packed dance floor, beautiful women. 
 And that could be us right now, if we'd chosen different paths. 
 No way, man. Not me. 
 I mean, I'd probably be working construction at Timmons, married to Denise, baby on the way. 
 Yeah, but you're not, because we decided to serve, protect, and cruise around, looking awesome. 
 Yeah. Yes. Yes, we did. 
 1:30 in the morning, there's still a lineup. 
 I never had to line up. 
 All I did was flash my smile, show my fake I.D., and and it was, "Pull that rope aside, Mr. Bouncer, please." 
 Now it's mac and cheese,"Finding Nemo," and bed by 9:30. 
 I know. I love that movie. 
 All units, we have a disturbance at 2480 Richmond, Vestibule Nightclub. An officer is involved. 
 All right.Light 'em up. 
 Rookie Blue Season 02 Episode 02 
Might Have Been 
Original Air Date:  June 30, 2011 
 Dispatch said officer involved. 
 Get off him now! 
 Where's the officer? 
 I don't know, but we're here now. 
 Hey! Police! That's enough! 
 All right! Everyone just calm down! 
 Try it on me. 
 She started it! 
 Pepper spray, anybody? 
 Who wants to spend a night in the pokey? 
 Johnny. Stop it. 
 Because rounding up a bunch of drunks like y'all Reminds me why I love my job! 
 Check for weapons, injuries. Come here. 
 Yeah, you're gonna want to get some ice on that. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Hey Sunshine! You're coming with me! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa... 
 I'll start with her. 
 'Course you will. Let's go. 
 This is officer Diaz. I'm downstairs. Call E.M.S. I've got a possible O.D. 
 Hey, Come on, buddy stay with me. 
 Are you sure you're up to this? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I actually kind of think it's cool. 
 You know, it's like a do-over. 
 You're putting away a bad guy who got away with it six years ago. 
 I'm not saying any more, scum bucket. 
 That would be Nero Musconi, suspected hit man, but thanks to new D.N.A. evidence, soon-to-be-convicted hit man. 
 Yeah, guy spit on the body after he popped him. Classy. 
 So what do I have to do, exactly? 
 Just listen to the tapes, make sure our notes line up. 
 Yeah, we've been over it So many times, we need a new perspective. 
 Just make sure it makaks sense to somebody who wasn't there. 
 Look, I love you for doing this. 
 Yeah, though I promise you, by the end of it, You will be saying... 
 I'm not saying any more, scum bucket. 
 How's your Saturday night, McNally? 
 Just working a murder case... with Luke and Jo. 
 Was their last big case before he came to 15. 
 Yeah, they were quitita team. 
 I guess. 
 So what are you doing, exactly? 
 Just double-checking, you know. 
 I found a baby. 
 What? 
 No, I did.ln the middle of high park. 
 This woman called it in, Said she was walking her dog and she heard it crying. 
 Swarek held it while I took her statement. 
 You held a baby? 
 No, I, uh, took down a purse snatcher, two drunk drivers, And a streaking engineer student, then I held a baby. 
 Know what? I should go. 
 Lot of bad guys out there, McNally. You sure you want to be doing paperwork? 
 Well, they need me. And Luke asked me to, so... 
 Your call. Enjoy. 
 Dispatch said there was an officer involved. That would be you, Nash? 
 I don't see any other uniforms. 
 Oh no. Look at this. 
 Tell me you're not gonna shut this place down. 
 Your staff's assaulting its customers, tends to be bad for business. 
 Yeah. They left 7 bucks on a $90 tab. 
 What, that's a that's a bad tip? 
 Yeah, look who I'm talking to, huh? 
 Good to see you, partner. 
 "Officer involved," I should have known. 
 Had to say something to get your lazy ass to show up, didn't I? How are you? 
 Traci Nash, Patrick Murphy. 
 Pleasure.. 
 She was your waitress? 
 She literally threw the tip at us and then started shoving me, The crazy bitch, she goes nuts. so Johnny... 
 She pulls out some of my hair. Write that down, buddy. 
 One at a time. 
 "Pulls out some of the victim's hair." 
 One at a time. 
 You two reside at the same address? 
 Excuse us. 
 Oliver says to make this go away. Disburse everyone. 
 No one comes back to the barn. Doesn't want anyone pressing charges. 
 But Chris got punched. 
 You know how they said there was an officer involved? It's the owner. 
 He's an ex-cop. He's a friend of theirs from the academy. 
 All right, here's the deal. 
 You want to press charges, you got to come back to my division. 
 That can take a long time. There's gonna be court dates... 
 Buddy, no. I want that skank arrested. I want her charged. I want it done now. 
 That you don't want to do. 
 Johnny... 
 Let me do this. 
 Let her go. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Let her go now. 
 Excuse me. 
 I hear one of my waitresses started all this. 
 She's been fired, so how about I make it up to you? Open tab? Rest of the night? Cool? 
 Yeah. 
 Have a good night, officer. 
 Your club has a drug problem. 
 I know, but you can't shut me down. 
 It took me years to get the club where the kids actually show up. Come on. 
 Well, if it wasn't for one of 15's finest, one of those kids would have O.D.'d. 
 I know, and I appreciate it. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Here's what we'll do. I'll put a bouncer in both bathrooms, hire a few extra guys to work the floor. 
 Not enough. We've had nine complaints about Vestibule in the past year. 
 And what's worse? 
 I heard that from a reporter. 
 She quite sanely asked why 15 Division's never done anything about the drugs spewing out of your club. 
 I told her anything she reported would jeopardize our ongoing investigation. 
 Okay. You're right. lt's a problem. 
 I got a snitch in clubland. 
 No C.I.'s. Nothing complicated. I want this fast, simple. 
 I'll make it simple. Put me undercover. I'll bust the dealer. 
 What? 
 Yeah, Ollie, right. 
 You gonna try to slide your gut into a pair of skinny jeans you'll be made before the lights go on. Come on. 
 Well, anybody got any better ideas? I'm all ears. Come on. 
 You fired that waitress last night. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. Send McNally in. She can do it. And, uh, and Peck. Send 'em both in. 
 Target. 
 Do we have earpieces? 
 Nah, no point. We're not gonna be able to hear you. Music'll be too loud, but we'll be right across the street, and you will have... can I trade you? 
 Fine. 
 Okay. 
 You will have...These. 
 Personal cell phones stay here. These are clean. 
 Got a tiny little mic, in case you get lucky. 
 Push this button right here and we'll pick it up. Plus, they got a camera, okay? 
 A phone with a camera in it. 
 That's unbelievably cool. I... 
 All right figure out who's dealing. 
 Get pictures, audio if you can. And what's the most important thing? 
 Success. What? 
 Sensible shoes. 
 Make it real. You're not pretending to be waitresses... 
 You are waitresses. 
 Like, what he said, so... 
 Tell the truth whenever you can, or close to it. 
 You and Jo are done with me, right? 
 Yeah, no, it's up to us now. 
 Means a weekend of all Nero Musconi all the time, but hey, be safe, drink coffee, make good tips. We need a new sofa. 
 Sounds good. 
 What's the matter? 
 I just don't usually take it like this. 
 Maybe it wasn't for you. 
 The one undercover job that I'm perfect for, and I can't do it 'cause I got burned at the location last night. 
 Andy and Gail don't even know from waitressing. 
 She keeps saying to me it's gonna be easy. 
 And you do know? 
 The fast food goddess till I was old enough to schlep drinks. 
 Well, you're right. Working an operation like this is a good thing, Especially if you want to make detective. 
 That's my point exactly. 
 Jerry, listen. 
 Jerry, you put me on this thing, okay? Patrick's a buddy. 
 You put me in as a customer. 
 You can't go there.You're already at the scene. 
 Jerry. 
 Just one sec. You know how these drug cases get. 
 They get tossed out for the slightest thing. 
 Come on. 
 What? 
 Officer Nash here's spent some time serving bar. 
 She knows club life. You should take her. 
 Yeah, fine. Good. 
 I take it you two used to date? 
 When you say date, um... 
 Lots of crazy s*x, Lake Shore motels, lnterrogation rooms? 
 You are good. 
 You know, the nurse said it wasn't broken, but it sure feels like it. 
 Why do women always date douchebags? 
 What, instead of you? 
 No, instead of anyone who's not a complete aggro meathead. 
 It's probably a pherorone thing. Can't let it get to you. 
 I knew it. Guy's in the system. Two assault charges, one brought by a woman. 
 Do you think she knows? 
 Who are we talking about? 
 Beatrice, girl from last night. I... I got to tell her. 
 No. No, you don't. 
 Did you see that guy? 
 Yeah, I also saw her. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Look, Dov, people date the wrong people all the time. Okay? 
 And we can't do anything about it until they call us. 
 Oh no. 
 What's wrong? 
 No. I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna sneeze. 
 Ice is in the walk-in. Keep the bar bucket full. Soda's there...Sinks... 
 Kegs and wine are in the back, by the office. 
 Do we need a key? 
 Back office is off-limits to new staff. 
 You need anything, you get me. 
 And don't think you're fooling me that you've done this before. 
 I know exactly what's going on here. 
 Which one of you's sleeping with Patrick? 
 We've got a 3-inch minimum. 
 You're not working retail at the mall, honey. 
 Shut your face. 
 I don't like it. 
 It doesn't matter if we can see the front of the club. We can't hear anything. 
 They're gonna be fine. They can send us a message. 
 Until she gets hit with a rush. 
 My bet, we're sitting here a few good shifts before they even begin to get anywhere. 
 Sushi or Thai, anyone? 
 Nash likes Bulgogi. 
 What the hell is bul... 
 Delicious Korean meat thing. 
 There's a cart on Spadina. 
 Hot dogs it is. 
 H-how's leo? 
 Good. 
 He's good. He's starting grade one. 
 Grade one. 
 He's great. 
 Dating anybody? 
 No. 
 Be right back. 
 Okay. One crantini, uh, one wine, Chardonnay, I think, and three gin-and-tonics. 
 Should I be asking for I.D.? 
 The Jameses do it at the door. 
 Okay. Both bouncers are named James? 
 Or maybe it's their last name, And, uh, they're married and very traditional. 
 Two vodka martinis, one dirty, one with extra olives, two shots of tequila, and the guy over there wants something called a Sunday sling? 
 Tell him to talk to Big James. 
 Thank God it's a slow night. 
 Oh really? 'Cause for a Sunday, this place is pretty rockin'. 
 Who had the crantini? 
 Me. 
 White wine? 
 That's me. 
 Beatrice. Sorry to bother you. Officer Epstein. 
 Oh, hi. 
 I didn't recognize you without your uniform. 
 Yes. That's 'cause I am not here as a cop. I'm just here as me. 
 Is, uh, Johnny home? 
 Johnny's at work. 
 Okay. I just wanted to make sure you were all right. 
 I-I feel like things didn't get handled properly last night. 
 I was under orders to resolve things quietly, and... 
 Anyway, uh, I ran your boyfriend's name through our computer. 
 Does the name Emily Viner mean anything to you? 
 Johnny used to date her. 
 Are you aware that on two separate occasions, she called 9-1-1 on him? 
 I think your boyfriend has an anger issue. 
 I just thought you should know. 
 If you need anything, don't hesitate to call. 
 Call? 
 Us. The police. 
 Have a good night. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks. 
 Gonna be a long one? 
 Monthly reports... figure I should read 'em before I sign 'em. 
 Well, heavy is the head that wears the brass. 
 Noelle. 
 You know, uh, Max Vermeer over in 22? 
 Yeah. I drank him under the table at last year's charity basketball tournament. 
 As a matter of fact, he still owes me 20 bucks. 
 Well, I ran into him last night. 
 He's got An offer to go to Dubai. Private security consultant. 
 Nice. That means he can definitely afford that 20 bucks. 
 Well, that means that a staff sergeant position will be opening up. 
 I think you should go for it. 
 Yeah, I don't know. 
 Come on. You know you want these stripes. 
 I make 'em look good. 
 True, true, but, uh, I just... 
 I got some things going on. It's not a good time. 
 Everything all right? 
 Yeah. It's great. 
 Yeah? 
 I mean... 
 I just don't want to get stuck actually having to read the stuff I sign. 
 But have fun. 
 All right. 
 Don't forget what I said. 
 You get better tips if you smile. 
 One of my customers asked for a Sunday sling. 
 Tori said they were your specialty. What is it? 
 It's what you take Saturday night that puts you in a sling Sunday. 
 Good to know. 
 I saw blue shirt palm the bouncer some money. 
 No product changed hands, though. 
 Where'd he go? 
 I don't know. I must have lost him. 
 There he is. 
 Know what? I'm gonna go check what's back there. Cover me. 
 No, my tables. 
 Okay, can... can I get another round for table seven, please? 
 Watch the bar for a sec. 
 Wait, there's breaks? 
 Not for you. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I came to see you. 
 You should have waited at my place. 
 Yeah, well, I just got back into town... 
 You don't call. You don't text. Three weeks, I thought you were dead. 
 I get scared when I don't hear from you. 
 Yeah, yeah. I always come back to see you. 
 If we can't deal with the in-between time, then... 
 I hate the in-betweens. 
 Yeah. I was away. 
 I had to pick something up. 
 Some kid the other night almost O.D.'d in here. You have to be careful. 
 But if this goes down, it's gonna be good. 
 Like, how good? 
 Like, uh, 600k good. 
 And then that's it? 
 Yeah. 
 That's it. 
 Okay, people. 
 What's going on with Vestibule?? McNally. 
 Well, last night I overheard the bartender talking to her boyfriend, and he mentioned some deal worth $600,000. 
 Probably the main supply line. 
 You get a name? 
 We're... we're working on it. 
 If we get an I.D. on this guy, we might be able to cut this off at the source. 
 I thought I made myself clear. 
 We are on a clock with this. I need a bust fast, simple, tonight if possible. 
 We're figuring out how it works. I mean, we know that the bouncer takes the money Good. Bust him. 
 You know what, Frank? If it's the bouncers, then I think Pat Murphy can help with this. 
 Patrick Murphy isn't a cop anymore. He needs to stay out of this. So do you. 
 Burn. 
 This case is making me sick. We need a bust tonight, okay? So let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go! 
 Hey. 
 You working undercover again tonight? 
 That is the plan. 
 Yeah? 
 Does that mean you're gonna be wearing that outfit? 
 I am. 
 And I'm probably gonna be very, very tired, so I'm gonna need you to help me take it off. 
 Seriously? Could you please give it a rest for, like, a day? 
 Have you seen my sandwich? 
 No. 
 It's it's your, it's that girl. 
 Beatrice. Hey. 
 Thanks for helping out with this. It's actually harder than I thought. 
 I don't want to say I told you so, but don't grip it on the sides like that. 
 Right. Why? 
 Because it's not stable that way. 
 You wanna take up and under. Makes it easier. 
 You'd better get used to that, 'cause you're gonna be on your feet again all night. 
 Thanks, Traci. 
 So how was the van? 
 Hot, stuffy, awkward. 
 It's not easy being locked up with your person. 
 What? What are you talking about, your person"? 
 You know, that person that's wrong for you or bad for you, or maybe it's just crappy timing. I don't know. 
 It doesn't matter. You have a history. They get your jokes. 
 You can never get them out of your system... that person. 
 Yeah, you really need to get out of that van. 
 I don't want to. 
 Walk. 
 
 
 
 Well, how was I inappropriate? 
 I don't know, but she also said that you made unwanted advances. 
 No, sir, I did not. I... 
 Her word against yours, But I'I'still trying to figure out what the hell you were doing there in the first place, off duty. 
 I had some information about her boyfriend. 
 Part of an official investigation? 
 Not exactly. 
 Not exactly? 
 So you went to her house, Then inside her house were these alleged, No! Not. I did not, okay? She's lying. 
 Her boyfriend... 
 Stop talking, Dov! 
 I have to figure out how I'm gonna deal with this, whether or not to send it upstairs. 
 Any suggestions? 
 Look, just tell them what happened. 
 How? It's like the whole system's against me. 
 First Oliver tells me not to do anything, then I try to do the right thing. 
 Now Sarge is coming down on me. 
 I just need to talk to her. 
 No, you don't. 
 I know I can't...but maybe you could, right, woman to woman? 
 Dov, stick to the facts, okay, even if it does go upstairs. 
 I gotta go 'cause the van's gonna leave without me, But, Dov, it's gonna be okay. 
 All right. 
 Let's head out. Okay? Take your mind off things. 
 I can't. Sarge wants me in booking all night. 
 All right. 
 Cheese, no pickles, please, Joanna, and can I get a little, extra gravy on the side to go? Thanks. 
 It's good to see some things never change. 
 You still eat like a fat guy. I don't know how you keep those pounds off, man. 
 Yeah? Three daughters, that's how. 
 Lots of energy, big backyard. 
 How's the beautiful wife? 
 Awesome, awesome. 
 Good. 
 You haven't been in here in a while. 
 Nope, just wanted to know if you slackasses have cleaned up my place yet or not. 
 I've got a business to run, you know? 
 Yeah, I know. We're on it. We're on it. We're on it. 
 Yeah. 
 We can't all be supercops like you used to be. 
 Yeah. Look where it got me. 
 Let me buy you a drink, all right? I want to see some pictures of those daughters. 
 Soda water for me, buddy. 
 Yeah, maybe for you. 
 These hours are killer. 
 I haven't seen my boyfriend in forever. 
 Plus, he's working with his ex, which, I'm not worried, but, you know, they've got a history. 
 The only way to make it work is with a guy in the industry. 
 He is. Well, sort of. Managememt. 
 Well, what about you, Tori? You dating anyone here? 
 You mean like the owner? No. I actually earned my job. 
 Okay, I'm gonna need that round for table four, please. 
 Thank you. 
 So what does your guy do? 
 Besides ignore me? 
 If he wasn't the screen saver on my phone, I don't think I'd know what he looks like. 
 You want me to watch the bar for you? 
 I need a cigarette break. I'll be in the basement. 
 Here he is. You know him? 
 No. 
 What? I thought you knew all the drug guys. 
 Lot of drug guys, McNally, but, I'll get this out on the street, see if I can get an I.D., okay? 
 Okay. I gotta go. Look, I'm gonna get fired! 
 You gotta admit, this is fun, huh? Way better than paperwork. 
 We make a good team, you and me. 
 What are you saying? 
 Just what I said. What do you mean? 
 Nothing.  I gotta go. 
 Okay. Careful. 
 Don't have too much fun, huh? 
 So listen, I was thinking about this complaint thing. 
 Yeah? 
 Beatrice says I went inside her house...which I didn't! 
 Yeah, so it's her word against yours. 
 Exactly, but if someone was waiting in the car, they would've seen that I didn't go in. 
 Yeah, well, it's too bad you went alone. 
 But Sarge doesn't know that... and neither does Beatrice. 
 Dov, I'm not gonna lie for you, man. 
 But she's the one lying about me. 
 I mean, you believe me, right, that I didn't do anything to that girl? 
 Yes, of course I believe you. 
 Look, I told you don't to go in there, and you did anyway. 
 I was trying to do my job serve and protect, remember? 
 You sure that's the only reason you were there? 
 What are you saying? 
 Look, I'm sorry, man. I... 
 This is the, uh, the lake house. Just put a new deck on it last year. 
 Holy. Wow. All looks like a beer commercial. 
 Yeah, they, uh, they shot one up there last summer. 
 Of course they did. 
 Yeah. 
 Gotta bring the girls up there one weekend. 
 You should. 
 You know... 
 You really made the most of taking one in the knee. 
 Seriously. 
 You took the pension, you know, and you made something happen. 
 I guess. 
 Still, some days, I, uh... 
 Well, I miss being out there, you know, riding around, king of the city. 
 Drunk guys. 
 Gettin' peed on. 
 Yeah. Good times. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it's not much different than running a nightclub, except you don't have a bunch of kids dealing dope behind your back. 
 Look, Ollie... 
 I can't let these guys destroy my place. I can't. 
 I mean, everything I own is, is tied up in it. Everything. 
 Just a couple more days. 
 All right? Things are just moving a bit slower than I thought they would. 
 Why? I thought this was gonna be simple. 
 Is it ever? 
 Look, don't worry, okay? We're gonna get 'em, okay? 
 Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. I got it. You get out there. Save the world. 
 All right. 
 Thank you for dinner. 
 All right. 
 You owe me. 
 I know I do. 
 Cheers. 
 Little guy at the bar... he slipped money to Big James when he came in. 
 I'll follow him. You follow me. I'll be in the back hallway. We go on my signal. Okay. 
 Who's gonna cover our tables? 
 It doesn't really matter if we make the bust, Andy. 
 What are you, a teenager? 
 You can text on your own time. Right now you work for me. 
 So what's it take to be detective? 
 You making conversation, or you actually want this job? 
 I don't know. I thought it would be fun. 
 I'd get to order ethnic food and burp while doing surveillance with an irresistibly hot rookie. 
 Irresistibly hot? Is that what you are? 
 Yeah, I guess you're right. 
 Okay. Don't look at me like that. 
 See, it's important to me that we're able to work together, and you know I made a decision... to be with Leo's Dad, because he's Leo's Dad. 
 Yeah, which makes him a good babysitter. 
 Doesn't make him good for you. 
 We gotta hit the bricks. 
 My C.I. says there's a good chance this guy is Russell Mackie. 
 Russell Mackie?? 
 Yeah. 
 Who's Russell Mackie? 
 He's a dealer from Montreal. 
 Got outstanding warrants for trafficking, conspiracy to traffic. 
 Yeah, and we're never gonna get him if we bust some meathead doorman named James. 
 Text Andy. Tell her it's off. Whatever they do, do not bust anyone tonight. 
 Yeah, I'm doing it, but she might not hear it. It's pretty loud in there. 
 All right. I'm going in. 
 Okay, wait. Hold on. You're gonna blow the whole thing. 
 No, no, no. I'm a cop answering a call. 
 All right. Keep this on. 
 Okay, Dad. 
 Russell Mackie. 
 We got a call for a disturbance. 
 Anybody here call the police? 
 Folks? Hello? 
 All right, I don't know what's going on here, But whatever it is, it stops right now. You got it? This stops now. 
 What the hell?! 
 Look, I got him! 
 What is going on? 
 What is this? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 I I thought he was running out on the bill. 
 I could sue you, you know? 
 Don't worry she's fired! 
 What?! 
 I don't care who you're sleeping with. You're done. Now. 
 Is there a problem, officer? Because, uh, I think we've got this under control. 
 You got it under control? Yeah? You sure about that? 
 Okay 'cause we don't need any more drama in here tonight, right? 
 Good. Thanks. 
 So you're sure the guy is Russell Mackie? 
 Yeah. I.D.'s confirmed. lt's him. 
 He's been off the radar for over a year. That's a big fish. 
 All in a day's work. 
 You know, Jerry's working on warrants to get a wire set up ln the club. 
 What, so you and Peck are just supposed to play it cool? 
 Oh, my God.That's the best part. Gail got fired. 
 It was great. 
 So you'll be in there without backup? 
 I'll be fine. 
 Yeah, I know you'll be fine, but, uh, Mackie's not some punk dealer. He's violent. 
 Jo and I looked into him a couple years ago on the Kovac murder. 
 You and Jo worked a lot of big cases together, huh? 
 Yeah. We're partners. 
 I know. 
 All right. Well, I should probably get going. 
 Andy. 
 I love you, you know? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 So I'm on probation? 
 That's right. 
 There'll be an investigation. A union rep will be in touch. 
 Epstein, every cop gets a complaint. 
 Well, what exactly does probation mean? 
 It means you'll ride with a supervising officer always. 
 Like a rookie? 
 You are a rookie. 
 And don't forget it. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Poor kid. 
 I heard you and Murphy tilted a few at the Penny last night. 
 Yeah. Yeah, we bumped into each other. 
 I'd be a little more careful who we bump into. 
 You know what? That's how it goes. You got your knuckles rapped. 
 You know, it happens to the best of us. 
 You ever think about not being a cop? 
 Shut up already. 
 You know what? Next time... just do better, you know? 
 You know what you gotta do? You gotta get a haircut. 
 1540, available units, we've got a domestic assault at 2675 Carlaw. 
 That's Beatrice's house. 
 Mark 1505. We're on our way. 
 You're off the clock. You can go home now. 
 Okay, yeah, I was just setting up for tomorrow. 
 Are you okay? 
 You want a drink? 
 Sure. 
 Stop struggling, kid, I didn't do anything! or I promise, it's gonna get ugly! 
 Yeah, except knock on your girlfriend! 
 You should, uh... 
 Wait in the car? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm warning you! 
 Don't test me! 
 Get off! 
 Get in the car! 
 Ma'am, is there anyone else in the house? 
 Are you... can you turn for me? 
 Are you all right? Do you need an ambulance? Are you hurt? 
 No. No, I'm fine. 
 Did he did that to you ? Does he live here? 
 Are you sure you don't want an ambulance? 
 I have a first aid kit in the car. 
 There's nothing I can do. 
 Russell's a classic Scorpio, extreme, intense, totally frustrating. 
 Yeah, and he's probably really sexy, right? 
 And smart and funny, and you can't keep your hands off of him. 
 Sounds like you know him. 
 I know the type. 
 He's texting me. 
 So, what does your guy do for a living? 
 He does all kinds of things, most of them illegal. 
 That must be hard. 
 Go, Andy. 
 It's hopeless. 
 I keep trying to end it, and he just ignores me for weeks, I don't hear from him, he doesn't call, and then he just shows up, and you can't say no. 
 I get it. I get it. It's kind of exciting and gets your heart going. 
 So you dated a guy like that? 
 Yeah. I think we all have. 
 You know... 
 Russell's never even said he loves me. 
 I'm sure he does. 
 Why can't guys like that just come out and say the way they feel? 
 I wish I knew. 
 So your guy's like that? 
 Luke? 
 No. No, he's great. 
 He tells you he loves you? 
 Yeah. Actually he does. 
 To Luke. 
 That was great work today, detective. 
 Yeah, there's no way Mosconi walks this time. 
 It was definitely easier than I thought, going back in time like that. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Come on, scum bucket. One drink. 
 Okay. Night then. 
 Come on. Don't be like that, all right? 
 Why? What else do you want to do? 
 Night, Luke. 
 Your ears must be burning. 
 Who's she? 
 My friend. 
 That's Mackie. He's here. 
 Andy. You're Russell, right? 
 How do you know my name? 
 'cause you're famous. Why do you think? 
 This is echo 1. We need backup. 
 See, I make one friend, and this is what happens. 
 I need to talk to you. Now. 
 You're high. 
 Let's go. 
 No. I already told you, I'm not dealing with you when you're like this. 
 You been talking to the cops? 
 What? Yeah. Okay. Right. I've been talking to the cops. You are getting paranoid. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, wait! Leave her alone. Let her go, otherwise I will call the cops. 
 Oh, that's what you're gonna do, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 You're gonna call the cops? 
 All right. You know what? Relax. Stop waving the gun around. 
 Your friend here how long have you known her? 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
 Couple of days. 
 A couple of days, and you're shooting your mouth off. You stupid bitch. 
 Okay, you know, we were just sitting around having a couple drinks, okay? 
 She didn't even tell me anything. I don't even know what you're talking about, so just calm down. 
 Don't. Do not tell me what to do! 
 Don't tell me what to do! 
 Get the gun out of my face, all right?! 
 Police! Don't move! 
 McNally? 
 I'm okay. I don't know what happened. I don't know where it came from. 
 Shots fired. Vestibule nightclub. We need an ambulance. 
 Police! 
 Put the gun down. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa it's me. It's me, okay? 
 Put it down! 
 I'm putting it down. 
 Take it easy. 
 Slowly. 
 Okay. 
 I was in the back office. 
 I heard yelling. Look the guy was gonna kill her. 
 She didn't have any backup. 
 How's the nose? 
 It's it's better. Thanks. 
 Good. 
 So you were right, you know, about that girl's boyfriend. 
 Yeah. Didn't really want to be right about that one. 
 Yeah, well, she's pressing charges, so that'll probably help with everything. 
 I mean, you know, you were just trying to do the right thing. 
 It doesn't matter. You were right. 
 I shouldn't have gone over there, and I never should've asked you to lie. 
 Here you go, pal. 
 Thanks. 
 God, I can't stop shaking. This is crazy. 
 Been a while since you fired a gun. 
 Just tell me, all right? Who was he? 
 I'm sure you guys have I.D.'d him by now. 
 Name's Russell Mackie. 
 Does that name ring a bell? 
 No? 
 He was a coke dealer, you know, back in the day. 
 I'm surprised you don't, uh...Whatever. 
 What we're really trying to figure out is why he thought his girlfriend was talking to the cops. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Come on. 
 You put two rookies in there. I'm sure they let it slip. 
 I wouldn't want to be held accountable for our first few times undercover, right? 
 You know, it's a hard job. 
 Ain't that the truth. 
 So what's next? 
 You... 
 When did you start working with Mackie? 
 What? 
 Ex-cop. That that has gotta be convenient. 
 Lots of drug connections, lots of potential business partners. 
 Are you serious? 
 I saved that rookie's life. 
 And killed the only person who could connect you to this. 
 You realized we were getting too close.You had to protect your business, right? 
 Everything you got's tied up in it. 
 I took a bullet... on duty... protecting you. 
 Yeah, you did. Yeah. 
 They're executing a search warrant on the club, your condo. 
 I told them to check the lake house. 
 Go for it. Check phone records, too. 
 I know what you're doing. I know how this works. 
 Yeah, I know you do, and that's why we're not gonna find anything. 
 Brother, you got an enviable life... 
 But I wouldn't want to be you, not when Mackie's crew finds out what you did. 
 Even if they don't. 
 Ollie. Ollie! 
 I'm done. I'm done here. 
 I miss you. 
 I just wanted to get that out in the open. I wanted to say it. 
 Now we can forget it. 
 Forget it? 
 Trace. 
 It's... 
 Come here. 
 ♪ I'll put my hands in yours and hold on tight ♪. 
 It's all right. 
 ♪ let's see what we can find ♪ 
♪ if I could show ♪ 
♪ you are the gold ♪ 
♪ then you would know ♪. 
 Good work tonight. Smart. 
 Kept it real. 
 I just stuck with it, the way I was taught. 
 ♪ let me open up those pretty eyes ♪ 
 Wow! New look. 
 Yeah. It's my showered and shaved, picking up my girlfriend look. 
 Even had a nap. 
 I love you, you know? 
 I know.
