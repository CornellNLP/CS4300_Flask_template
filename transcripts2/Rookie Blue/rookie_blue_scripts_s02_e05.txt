 Are you bored yet Epstein? 
 No, M'am. 
 I am still on probation so I am happy to just watch, learn... Thank you very much. 
 You familiar with this neighborhood? 
 Yeah, 70% live below the poverty line. 
 Low-income families living in social housing communities. 
 Ghettos. 
 So what happens if we give these drivers a ticket? 
 It goes on their driving record. 
 Their insurance goes up. 
 And if they can't pay their insurance? 
 They can't drive. 
 Um-hum. 
 Lots of hardworking folks in this neighborhood... folks that need to drive to work in order to pay their bills. 
 You gotta think big picture. 
 Oh no, they didn't. 
 Oh yes, they did. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Talk to the girlfriend while I run this guy. She seems a little jumpy. 
 Evening, miss. 
 How you doin'? 
 I'm good And where are you two headed tonight? 
 We're going out to dinner. 
 Really? Fantastic.I would kill for a souvlaki right now. 
 My shift's not over for another hour or so. 
 What restaurant you headed to? 
 I have drugs in my bra! 
 Noelle! Take the girl! She's holding! 
 Hands up! Hands up! 
 Police! You're under arrest! 
 You shot me! 
 No, I did not! 
 I can't believe you shot me! 
 Shut up! 
 This is Epstein. 
 I'm in the Crawford co-op playground. Suspect's in custody Hey! Don't move. Come here! 
 You shoot this man? 
 You told him to stop. 
 My mom said people should listen to the cops. 
 Your mom's a smart lady. 
 I'm gonna have to take that slingshot. 
 Now go home. Get outta here. And no more hanging around playgrounds after dark. 
 Thanks for the backup. 
 What's going on with him? 
 Bee sting. 
 Well, ain't karma a bitch? 
 Come on. A bee sting. 
 Rookie Blue Season 02 Episode 05 
Stung 
Original Air Date: July 21, 2011 
 You took down a guy with five warrants. That's gotta be some sort of record. 
 Are we going to Black Penny to celebrate? 
 No, thank you.I'm just gonna head home. 
 Want to get a good night's sleep lf I'm gonna keep my performance consistent. 
 10-4, Officer Buzzkill. 
 Oh and hey, try not to make too much noise when you come in tonight. 
 Unique opportunity mounted unit 
 Dex packed his bags. Said he didn't want to live a lie anymore. 
 Drama queen. 
 Him. Not you, obviously. 
 From now on, I'm gonna live in the moment. 
 No more going backwards to make other people happy. 
 Sounds like a really good plan, Trace. 
 You good? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 Ready to go? 
 Have a good night, okay? 
 And get some sleep. 
 ♪ Come down, come quickly. ♪ 
♪ Look at the lights in the big city. ♪ 
♪ Sewers smoking, what the hell? ♪ 
♪ Is it toxic I can't tell. ♪ 
 Is that what the kids are listening to now? 
 My physical's in six days. I'm still two minutes slower than last month. 
 Yeah, well, you didn't have three belly buttons last month, did you? 
 How's it feeling? 
 Like I'm gonna ace my physical. 
 Yeah? 
 God, you're sexy when you're sweaty. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Then, uh, maybe we should get married in Jamaica. 
 I'm really, really sexy in Jamaica. 
 We could. My parents eloped. 
 Got up in the middle of the night and drove to Niagara Falls. 
 Yeah, it worked out really well for them. 
 I know I want my Dad to come, but I haven't decided if I want to invite my mom to the wedding yet. 
 You know you don't have to. 
 I don't know. 
 I just feel like maybe I should give her another shot. 
 I don't know. 
 I just don't want to see you get hurt, babe. I mean, to me, lt seems she made a choice when she walked out, right? 
 I guess so. 
 If you wanna mend that fence, a wedding's a perfect excuse. 
 Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, huh? 
 Yeah. Depends how many times I get married. 
 All right, I'm gonna be late. I gotta go. 
 Take it easy, all right? 
 Yeah. 
 You're on the mend. 
 Yeah. 
 On the mend? 
 Thanks to... 
 Epstein and Williams, we got a serial lawbreaker off the street last night. 
 Today we're going to build on that success. 
 All of these fine citizens have outstanding warrants and today we're gonna get 'em off our streets and into a cell. 
 Go ahead. Ask me how we're gonna get 'em. 
 How are we gonna get them? 
 We're gonna run a sting. 
 Sunray Motors is opening their new dealership on Monday, but today, they're lending it to us. 
 Nash, Peck, McNally, make the prize notification calls. 
 Use any numbers we have on file. 
 Well, good morning, Mr. Wilcox. 
 This is Sunray Motors calling, congratulating you on becoming our grand prize winner. 
 Mr. Coglin, your son has been randomly selected as our grand prize winner. 
 All he has to do is come in to our new showroom. 
 And I will personally hand you the keys to a new car. It's that simple, Mrs. Shapiro. 
 Outstanding warrants 
 Swarek is running point on this, and he'll have the showroom ready to go. 
 The back room is gonna be the command post. 
 Williams and Shaw, they'll be running surveillance. 
 Everyone in the showroom will be wearing earpieces. You will be miked. 
 Check. Check. Check. 
 Now the teams are, Swarek, Epstein, Nash, McNally, Diaz and Peck. 
 There you are. 
 Some of the suspects will be suspicious, and they may not want to give up their names. 
 Showroom is hot.Thank you, brother. 
 You bet. 
 Cheers, my friend. 
 Some of the customers may not be people who we are looking for. 
 They might be civilians in off the streets. 
 So you have to stall as long as you can, while Noelle and Oliver try to make a visual. 
 Once this happens, you will hear the signal in your earpieces. What is the signal? 
 Bohemian Rhapsody. 
 When you hear the signal, you get 'em into the office, get 'em outta sight, make the arrest. 
 We clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 All right, let's serve, protect, get these asses off our streets. 
 "Bohemian Rhapsody." 
 You showed a lot of character taking your lumps, Epstein. 
 It would be a mistake keeping you on probation. 
 Really? I mean, thank you. 
 Before you go, I, uh, I saw a posting for the mounted unit training. 
 I was thinking about applying. 
 Williams. 
 Epstein, uh, wants to apply for the mounted unit training. What do you think? 
 I think he's got his mojo back. But I'm still not crazy about the haircut. 
 Keep your nose clean, and I might even recommend you. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Hey Noelle. Are we still on for tonight? 
 Yeah, yeah. Dinner. 
 But I know with stings, there's lots of paperwork, so we don't have to do it. Do it another time. 
 I'm gonna have to eat eventually. 
 All right.See you after shift. 
 All right. 
 You've won quite the prize here, Mr. Tremblay. 
 This subcompact is a cut above the rest. It's edgy, and sophisticated... big backseat. 
 Perfect for a new family. 
 This is our first. Could you show me where the car seat straps go? 
 Of course, Mrs. Tremblay. 
 I just need to see some, uh, ldentification,Barry. 
 I wouldn't want the, uh, grand prize to go to the wrong person. 
 Got a Barry tremblay? 
 Warrant for... failure to pay child support. 
 A deadbeat Dad to one kid already. Man. 
 Bohemian Rhapsody. 
 I believe this is the child safety tab. 
 If you care to step into the office, I can show you the collision test results. 
 They're quite remarkable. 
 That'll put her mind at ease. Angie, come on. 
 Maybe you should read the manual. 
 Right this way. 
 All right. 
 Barry Tremblay, congratulations. 
 You're under arrest for failure to pay child support. 
 Man, Swarek... so awesome. He's, like, a method cop. 
 You got a little man crush, Dov? 
 No, it's just, you know, he's so good at his job that I feel like I learn so much just being around him. 
 Totally get it, man. 
 Oh come on. Like you don't know exactly what I'm talking about. 
 You all do. I know Andy does. 
 You get to ride with him all the time. 
 Okay, we get it. You want to marry Swarek, Dov. Let's move on. 
 So I was just wondering, you know, I haven't got an invitation in the mail or anything, but, uh, you're still getting married, right? 
 Because I bought a really, really expensive suit,and I'm pretty sure I lost the receipt to it. 
 Yes, we're still getting married. 
 Luke and I just have a few details to work out before we set the date. 
 We'll get this one. 
 Welcome to Sunray Motors. You must be one of our grand prize winners. 
 Yeah. Actually, I'm here to pick up the prize for my brother. 
 I can't believe this. How could you do this to me? 
 I've never been more humiliated in my life. 
 I'm gonna take the house. I'm gonna take the car. We still get the car, right? 
 No? 
 I'm gonna take everything. The dog is coming with me. I'm keeping my ring. 
 Bye. 
 Why should I go in here? I'm not a criminal Unfortunately, we can't actually, you know, give the prize away to anyone but the winner, mister, uh... 
 Say what? 
 Are you sure your brother can't make it in today? 
 Yeah. He's out of town all week, you know? 
 Well, maybe I can get him on the phone. What's his name? 
 His name's Dominic. But you know what? Dominic Summers. But never mind. 
 You know, maybe I should, uh, You got anything yet? 
 Come back this guy is gonna bolt. 
 No Dominic. No Summers. No visual match. 
 There's no hassle. 
 Well, my brother, you know... 
 All right, hey. 
 What about this? 
 I like that silver one. 
 Tony Franklin... two breach of recogs, failure to appear. 
 Yeah, brother, my ass. 
 I'm really sorry. I'll come back with my brother. 
 It's gonna be awesome, all right? See ya. 
 Bohemian Rhapsody. 
 Mr. Summers. 
 You know what? 
 Your brother shouldn't lose out over a technicality. 
 I'm sure I can convince my manager to release the prize to you. 
 Oh yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 For real, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 A'ight. 
 Yeah, let's do that. 
 Right this way. 
 Nice tie, man. 
 Thanks. 
 You're very personable. 
 I get that a lot. 
 Nice. 
 Here we go. 
 All right, uh, you guys take the librarian, and, uh, we'll take fancy pants. 
 Okay. 
 Good morning. Welcome to Sunray Motors' grand opening. 
 Well, I-I got a call on my cell. A woman said I won a car. 
 Well, then you must be one of our grand prize winners. 
 Congratulations, uh, Miss... 
 Senett. Mrs. Leigh Senett. 
 Are you sure I won? I've never won anything in my life. 
 You got a Leigh Senett? 
 We said we're sure. 
 You want to take a look at the car right now? 
 Someone should've paid her bills on time. 
 You know, I'm kinda thinking of changing the code word. 
 I'm very bored with this one. 
 What do you think of "Stairway To Heaven"? 
 Really? 
 Bohemian Rhapsody. 
 Bohemian Rhapsody. 
 You know, if you'll just step into the back office, we will have you on the road ln your brand-new car in no time. 
 Can I see the engine? 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Well, my car barely works anymore. I spend more time trying to fix it than driving it. 
 I'd just love to see a brand-new engine. - Sure. Yeah. 
 That's... 
 Thanks. 
 Here it is. 
 Dual... 
 How long is this gonna take? 
 Come on. Let me show you what you won, okay? Come on. Come on. 
 Right this way, sir. 
 Sir, come here. Check this out, all right? 
 You're looking at a 2.6-liter engine, in-line, 4-cylinder, dual overhead cams with 158-horsepower. 
 She might look small, but she's got teeth, you know? 
 I like my cars with a little panache. 
 A little panache. Well, l, she comes in Barcelona Red. 
 Okay? 
 Another one bites the dust. 
 You know, if he'd stop doing laps around the car, I could get a better look at him. 
 Because it's the bottom on the car, hey, we're gonna throw in metal rims. 
 Attaboy, Sammy. 
 You're gonna get this off with a bang, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 I know what you're saying. 
 Marco Forlan. 
 Possession warrants. 
 Busted. 
 Name is Marco Forlan. 
 You like it? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Bohemian Rhapsody. 
 What's the rule? Can I sell it? 
 If you'd like to step into our office, we'd be happy to show you all the paperwork. 
 I don't want to see the paperwork. I want you to tell me the rules. 
 Well, the rules are simple. Basically Whoa, not you. Him. 
 You know what? 
 I think I prefer to take public transit. 
 Live green, save the world, hug a tree, etcetera. 
 We got a runner. 
 Try me. 
 Marco Forlan, you're under arrest for drug possession warrants and also almost messing up my suit. 
 Come on. Get up. 
 I knew you were cops. 
 Yeah? I knew you were dirty. 
 Diaz, Epstein, you wanna get Mr. Forlan outta here and into his cell before he blows this whole thing? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Okay, everyone okay? What's going on? 
 What? 
 What's going on, McNally? 
 Nothing. We lost a suspect. 
 You what? 
 She must've slipped out during the takedown. 
 She's gone, but she left this, so... 
 If Frank finds out you two lost a suspect, the only undercover assignment you're gonna get is Mr. and Mrs. Claus at the divisional Christmas party. Go. 
 Find her now before she tells every deadbeat in town we're doing a sting. 
 Okay. 
 You look like hell. Can I come in? 
 No. 
 Nice place. 
 Wheatgrass shake? 
 God, no. 
 Have a seat. 
 Meet Joseph Kadour. 
 He's not really my type. 
 He's in the city today to sell 200 forged passports. 
 We were supposed to have four on him, but, uh, Shepherd threw out his back at aquafit. 
 So I thought, uh, you might be interested. 
 I haven't been cleared to come back yet. 
 But you have been cleared for light duty, 'cause I checked. 
 Come on. What happened to Detective Luke Callaghan, Homicide? 
 He's on the mend. 
 Kadour's making the drop at the Edinboro Hotel. 
 Edinboro. Fancy. 
 Look, they have good police rates, and we know the security team. 
 Don't change the subject. 
 Look, all we need to do is bust Kadour with the passports. 
 Okay? Then we'll sneak you back into this nursing home, you go back to being on the mend. 
 Okay. 17th floor, room 154. Bring coffes for the guys. 
 Two double-double, one regular with cream, and, uh, you already know how I like mine. 
 Give us the name of your counsel. We'll arrange a phone call. 
 No, thanks. 
 Are you waving your right to counsel? 
 Whatever's easiest for you. 
 I just have one simple request. 
 We're not your concierge. 
 All I want is two minutes with one of your detectives. 
 No. Our detectives are busy right now, Mr. Forlan. 
 Well, when they've got a minute then. 
 Yeah, well, we'll see. 
 Let's see if Jerry's busy. 
 Dov, arrestees' rights don't include chatting with detectives for fun. 
 In court, he says we didn't let him talk to a lawyer. 
 Jerry can testify that he waived his call for a face-to-face with a detective. 
 
 
 
 I'm impressed. 
 I'm impressive. 
 If we came out here in these "Cagney & Lacey" getups, and she is not home, so help me... 
 She is gonna be home because I need to win today. 
 I have not slept well in eight nights. 
 Late, steamy nights in fiancee land? 
 No. Well, yeah, but no. 
 Mom dreams. I used to have 'em as a kid, and now they're getting worse. 
 Wedding stress? 
 I guess. 
 But now right before I say "I do," Luke turns into my mother and runs out of the church, and I can't catch her because I can't find the handle on the door. 
 My baby daddy punched my boyfriend in the mouth and then moved out. 
 Just sayin'. 
 All right. 
 We really need to win today. 
 She's so busted. 
 If she runs again, I'm-a stop feeling sorry for her and her broke-ass car. 
 Leigh. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm Officer McNally. This is Officer Nash. Does Leigh Senett live at this residence? 
 Never heard of her. 
 Well, her I.D. Has this address on it. 
 Then she needs to update her license. 
 Or maybe she lived here before you did? 
 I bought this house from the bank. I-I don't... 
 I don't know who the owner was before that. 
 Okay. Thanks for your time. 
 Thank you. 
 All right, new plan. Let's check the addresses registered to her cell phone number. 
 Okay, but if that doesn't work, I'm playing Mrs. Claus. 
 Marco Forlan. I'm Detective Barber. What do you want? 
 Nice suit, detective. Italian wool, pasolini cut. 
 Okay, I'm bored of you already. 
 Be nice. I have information you want. 
 Yeah, what I want right now is a coffee. 
 Well, how about the address to a massive grow house in the north end? 
 Let me guess... you give me the address, and I talk to the prosecutor and tell him to go easy on you, maybe keep you out of prison? 
 If I had a nickel... See what he's got. Let me know if it's worth my time. 
 Yes, sir. 
 There you are, baby. 
 Nice cover. 
 Well, it was either that or "Where's my pizza?" 
 But, you know, these kinda give you away. 
 Where are the other guys? 
 We got two U. C. Guys in the room across the hall. Spin team's next to them. 
 All we gotta do is make sure Kadour goes in and makes the deal. 
 You should fire the maid. 
 You're the neat one, remember? This is how I work. 
 How long until Kadour shows? 
 About an hour. 
 In the meantime, our U. C. guys are playing a wicked game of "Would You Rather." 
 I can't believe you volunteered us for a 15-page search warrant. 
 Quid pro quo. 
 Speak English. 
 Chances are the grow house is a bust, but we fill out the boring paperwork, and Jerry lets us check it out, and maybe, just maybe, we get lucky, find something there. 
 Then I'm a lock for the Mounted Unit training. 
 I don't know, man, my application's pretty solid. 
 What, you applied, too? 
 Well, yeah. As soon as the posting went up. 
 I didn't know you liked horses. 
 Yeah, I like the idea of being a horse cop. 
 It's kinda like being a cowboy. 
 There is no way that this is a grow house. 
 That's what they want you to think. 
 Check the hydrometer. See if the numbers are out of control. 
 Okay. 
 I read this drug squad report that said some growers install pressure plates round the meter, so as soon as you step on the plates... click. 
 It shuts off the excess power to the meter so it looks normal. 
 Pressure plates, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Seems normal. 
 Have a look inside? 
 Police! We have a warrant! Hello? 
 We knocked and nobody answered, so we picked the lock, which is perfectly within our rights. 
 Pretty sweet place. 
 Yeah, apparently, it's owned by an L. A. Music producer. 
 He leased it out for a year, maybe to the wrong people. 
 Yeah, so where are they now? 
 On a fertilizer run? 
 I don't know, but let's search it before they get back. 
 All right. 
 But the first pot plant or even a watering can, and we split, report back to Jerry. 
 That plan sucked. 
 Of course her cell phone's registered to a P.O. Box, 'cause nothing can be easy today. 
 Things are looking up. 
 You take 10:00. I'll take 2:00. 
 Oh, my God, please start. 
 Leigh Senett? 
 You're under arrest. 
 You can come out, or we can drag you out. 
 What's gonna happen? 
 Well, you're gonna spend the night in lockup, and you can see a judge in the morning. 
 No, not to me, to my car. 
 It goes to impound. 
 But these things are... are all I have. 
 You live in your car? 
 My whole world is here. 
 This looks a little more promising. 
 Just just slow down, all right? 
 Drug report also said that some grow ops are booby-trapped. 
 Just gotta be careful. 
 It's not a drug den. It's a basement reno. 
 Damn. 
 Do you smell that? 
 Booyah. 
 Dov, you know, we should just call this in. 
 Call what in? That our snitch led us to a construction permit violation? 
 No. First we see if there's anything here, then we talk to Jerry. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Dov, this isn't a grow op. This is a meth lab. 
 Yeah, we gotta get outta here now. 
 Don't move. 
 Okay, listen. You're gonna be fine, okay? Bomb squad can be here ln ten minutes. 
 They'll figure out what you're standing on and disarm it, okay? You're gonna be No, no, no. Don't... don't touch the radio. What if the frequency sets it off? 
 No, no, no. Listen, you gotta stay still, okay? You gotta let me call this in. 
 We can figure out a way. We can disarm this thing ourselves. 
 What are you... what are you talking about? 
 There's gotta be a shutoff switch. 
 Okay, listen. I'm gonna go look for a shutoff switch. Okay? Don't... move. 
 We got this. 
 We got this. 
 Her warrants are all for money owed to collection agencies and unpaid parking tickets. 
 That's probably a given when you're living out of your car. 
 So what, her whole life goes to impound, and that's that? 
 Stand by. 
 Jo's working a fraud case right now, so she gave me a little primer. 
 Going by Leigh's rap sheet, she hasn't committed any criminal offenses. 
 These are all committal warrants. 
 So if she can come up with the money... 
 Then we can take her directly to the court to pay it off and then we can let her go. 
 You're very sexy when you're reading the fine print. 
 Keep it in your pants, McNally. 
 If your daughter can bring the $3,000 you owe, we can release you. 
 I can't call her. 
 Well, I know it's a lot of money, but the alternative is jail time. 
 She doesn't know I lost the house. 
 She doesn't know you're living in you car? 
 Well, she lives eight hours away, and... and she has two children, and she's very busy. 
 And I don't want her to know. 
 But she's your daughter. 
 I mean, you need help. You're in trouble. 
 I-I was supposed to pull myself together after her father died. 
 Nicole made all the arrangements for the funeral, but then she went home, and all I had to do was find a way to live my life. So... 
 Every day, I woke up and I said,  "Leigh, today is the day you're gonna get things done." 
 And I'd sit down and I'd make a list, but at the end of the day, I... 
 I was just still sitting there, trying to figure out how to get anything done. 
 Why didn't you ask for help? 
 I didn't know how. 
 The were just too many things on that damn list. 
 Nothing? 
 I'm sorry, Dov. 
 It's okay. I called for backup. 
 Okay, go wait outside. If this thing goes off, I... 
 No, man. I'm not going anywhere. 
 If this goes off, I don't want yo- 
 No, I'm staying here. 
 If I kill you, Gail's gonna kill me. 
 Listen, if you keep moving, she won't have to. 
 Tell her I'm sorry. 
 You tell her yourself. Backup's here. 
 Then we wait for our guy to buy the fake passports, then, uh, we bust Kadour with the money, and Bob's your uncle. 
 How is Uncle Bob? 
 He bought a bicycle after his heart surgery. 
 He's so slim now, you wouldn't recognize him. 
 Good for him. 
 Yeah, I mean, except for the spandex shorts, but... 
 That's a hard look for anyone to pull off. 
 Tell him I say hello. 
 You could tell him yourself. 
 I mean, just 'cause we're not together doesn't mean we can't be friends, right? 
 I mean, we were friends first. 
 Come on. It wasn't that bad. 
 I mean, when we weren't fighting about whose career was more important... 
 Okay, you know what? I never put my career ahead of you, not once. 
 You wanted that promotion more than you wanted me. It's that simple. 
 The task force was a once-in-a-lifetime gig. You wanted it, too. 
 Yeah, and I decided to stay here because I thought we were building a life together, and you got on a plane and you took the job. 
 And I've regretted it ever since. 
 The mark's in play. We need eyes in the hallway. 
 You take audio. I got the hallway. 
 We are kicking ass today. 
 Ten delinquents already on their way to the clink. 
 And only three people spit on me today. 
 That's 'cause you have excellent customer service skills. 
 Thank you. 
 Come to shower us with praise, boss? 
 Shut it down. 
 Frank? 
 Diaz and Epstein... They're in trouble. 
 What's going on? 
 Peck, come with me. 
 Babe, open up. I left my key in there. 
 What took you so long? 
 No weapons visible. 
 Police! Get down on the ground. Get down on the ground! 
 Get up. 
 I don't care if your tip leads to the biggest bust of my career. 
 If one of my guys gets hurt, I'm gonna kill you with my own two hands. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What am I talking about? 
 The grow house, Marco... There's no marijuana. 
 You know what's there, right? 
 No? Meth lab. 
 What? 
 There's a meth lab rigged with booby traps that's got one of my rookies trapped on an I.E.D. 
 The guy I get my dope from told me that's where he gets it, okay? 2255 Beaumont. 
 He never said anything about traps. 
 If you know anything... 
 You better pray nothing happens to my rookie or you're going to prison for the rest of your life. 
 What? No. 
 You understand? 
 No. No. I can't go to prison. 
 I can't go to prison. 
 You know what they'll do to me there?! 
 It's gonna be fine, Gail, okay? 
 What't'going on? 
 We don't know. 
 No one's telling us anything. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I just... I tried to stay with him. They wouldn't let me and now... 
 It's okay. 
 If anything happens to him... 
 Nothing is gonna happen to him. 
 Look, Dov's gonna be okay. 
 Duke's got his best guy on it. 
 How we doing, Dov? 
 Been better. 
 Yeah? Okay, my name is Sue. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Now I want you to listen to me. Don't move. Just listen. 
 I'm gonna slide this sandbag under you. 
 Once it's secure, I'm gonna take your hand, and you're gonna step towards me slowly. 
 Got it? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 And then you and me are gonna grab a cup of coffee, and you're gonna tell me how a guy named Dov ended up as a police officer. 
 That's actually Hebrew for bear." It's a really manly name. 
 Well, you're still gonna get me coffee. 
 Okay. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 So you're gonna take one step and then another. Nice and slow. 
 Just keep your eyes on me, okay? 
 There's no rush. We can stay here all night until you're ready. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Okay. One more step, Dov. Piece of cake. 
 In case I don't have another chance to say this, thank you. 
 All units, move in. 
 That's us, guys. Let's go. Okay. 
 Sam, what's happening? 
 ♪ let's take the long way ♪ 
♪ watch the sunrise ♪ 
♪ listen to the radio ♪ 
♪ all through the night ♪ 
♪ take the long way ♪ 
♪ 'cause I like the view ♪ 
♪ go by the shoreline ♪ 
♪ look at the moon ♪ 
 You are such an idiot. 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 No, don't joke with me right now. 
 Your venom is getting on my shoes. 
 Don't be a jackass. 
 I'm sorry. Did somebody have a rough you could've died! 
 I almost did. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just after everything I did to be seen as an equal, I'm back to being the rookie screwup. 
 Dov, shut up. 
 The only person who sees you that way is you. 
 Give me two seconds. 
 I'll be in the parking lot. 
 Okay. Cool. 
 So Jerry thinks the lab was a gang operation, making 100 pounds of meth a month, and we helped take it down. 
 So I've been thinking, I'm going to withdraw my application for the mounted unit training. 
 What? Why? 
 Well, we do the same job, man. 
 We're gonna be competing for things all the time. Just didn't seem worth it. 
 If you want to apply, apply, and we'll figure it out. 
 Yeah, well, I don't know, man. I just... 
 If it was something I really wanted, I wouldn't back down, you know? 
 I hope you wouldn't either. 
 All right, fine. 
 Under one condition from now on, we both go for what we want. 
 All right. 
 May the best man win. 
 Yeah, may the best man win. 
 I'm so glad you're all right, man. 
 Crazy kid. 
 I'd make a great witness. I remember everything... names, faces, dates. 
 What are they gonna do with him? 
 They're keeping him in custody till the drug squad's done their investigation. 
 Then who knows? 
 Leigh Senett, please. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 I brought you some tea. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I've been stuck so long, afraid to move on, and now I'm in a jail cell. 
 It's kinda funny. 
 Well, you don't have to stay there. 
 Oh, it's not that bad. 
 It's the closest thing I've had to a bedroom in a long time. 
 I think you should call your daughter. 
 You need her. 
 Life is too short. 
 Don't ever get stuck. 
 Nicky, honey? 
 I'm sorry... I'm sorry it's so late. I just, I have to tell you something. 
 No, everything's okay. 
 Well, actually, it's not okay. 
 I think I need your help. 
 Lee called her daughter, finally checked something off her list. 
 Yeah, it's funny... 
 The minute you become a mother, you're suddenly expected to know how to balance everything, how to be levelheaded and nurturing, selfless. 
 There's a lot of pressure to be perfect, and it's just something to think about. 
 I never expected my mom to be perfect. 
 I just expected her to come back eventually. 
 Well, maybe you invite her back. 
 Seize the day, reach out to her. 
 Leigh lost everything. I know why she couldn't make that call. 
 But my mom walked out of my life, and she made that decision, so... 
 I have a family now. 
 I've got you and my Dad, Dov, Chris... 
 As much as I thought I would never say this... Gail. 
 And Luke. 
 Especially Luke. 
 Well, hello, Officer Williams. 
 You look... Wow! 
 Good. Have a nice evening. 
 Jeez. Where is she going? 
 I don't know. 
 To six months of solid police work and a long sentence with no parole. 
 Welcome back, Callaghan. 
 Yeah welcome back cheers. 
 Let's take this party to the Nelson. 
 I'm gonna grab my stuff. I'll meet you there. 
 See ya. 
 Are you gonna drive? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You're not gonna join them? 
 You broke my heart. 
 She's asleep. 
 Thanks. 
 You know, it's probably one of the first good night's sleep she's had in a long time. 
 Yeah, she said her daughter would be here in a few hours. 
 She was hoping you'd get to meet her. 
 I'd love to, but I am running off of four hours sleep, nine coffees, and I just really want to go say hi to Luke and sleep till Wednesday. 
 Okay, then have a good night. 
 Yeah, you, too.
