 What about this one? 
 Gunshot. 
 Really? 
 No. 
 Neighbor's dog. 
 I think I was, like, 5. 
 Mean little bugger. 
 You or the dog? 
 Both, probably. 
 What about this guy? 
 The one on your wrist. 
 Oh, I was building a dock at the cabin. 
 There was a piece of wood with a nail in it. 
 It really didn't hurt that much. 
 ♪ you're confused but I cannot pretend ♪ 
♪ swimming cold water under the rain ♪ 
♪ your frozen hand feels sober and sane ♪ 
 Everything all right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm just... getting a glass of water. 
 ♪ like it feels ♪ 
 Hey, I was actually worried. You know, you could've called. 
 Well, I figured you'd be asleep. 
 I was up all night cleaning. 
 Hey, you know they make this thing, it's like an... uh, it's like an eraser, you can get stains off the walls? 
 You actually cleaned our apartment. 
 Well, it's a long weekend. 
 Denise is coming down from Timmins. 
 Denise? 
 Well, I haven't heard you talk about her in a while. 
 I figured you guys broke up. 
 We did once, in the 11th grade, but she took me back. 
 Is she gonna be here all weekend? 
 Why? 
 Because I just found out in the best possible way, flight attendants have a serious thing for cops. 
 Last night... two-on-one. 
 Tonight they have a friend that wants to meet you. 
 Denise wants me to propose. 
 Propose what? 
 Well, she says that, um... 
 She... she told me, actually, that it's been way too long without a real commitment, and, um, you know, seven years, so... 
 What the hell are you gonna do? 
 No clue, man. 
 You walked out on him? 
 Yeah, I did. 'Cause I'm... I don't know. 
 I'm used to being alone, you know? 
 I like to sleep in my own bed. 
 I think it's weird. 
 You're weird. 
 Okay, you're not, but you're touchy this morning. 
 I know. It's my k-i-d. 
 Leo? Oh, right. They can't spell. 
 Well, if I'd known you couldn't keep a secret to save your life... 
 I don't know why it has to be a secret. 
 Well, it's on my own terms, everyone'd treat me different, look at me different. 
 So what's up with Leo? 
 Hates me, hates my job, wants to go live with daddy, all because he can't go to the Fenelon Fair this Saturday. 
 And what am I supposed to do? 
 Tell him his Dad bowed out on him at the last minute? 
 So what's daddy's problem? 
 Oh, daddy's distracted. 
 He's slippin' it to a yoga teacher he met in N.A. 
 Who's slippin' it to the yoga teacher they met at N.A.? 
 Your mother. Hey, Chris. 
 Hey, careful. Man's on a deadline. He's gotta propose or lose the girl he's loved since he had grass on the field. 
 So... are you gonna propose? 
 Well, you know, I love her, so... why not, right? 
 Well, congratulations. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah, 'cause it's a good plan. 
 Why play the field in the big city with your best friend to your banjo-playing second cousin? 
 You know what? Denise is a special girl... 
 And I'm sure you'll be very happy together. Come on. Psst. 
 Right. And you are? 
 Sorry. It's just, you know, I have trouble sleeping in other people's beds. 
 It's just this thing that I have. 
 It's all right. I get it. It's just, you know, when you wake up alone and you wonder where someone's gone, it can kind of ruin your whole day. 
 Well, it's early. Your day could still turn around. 
 You joining us for parade? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Okay, then. Anytime. 
 Everybody's got a plan. Everyone's off to the cottage with a case of beer everyone's gonna spend three long days grilling and lounging on the dock... 
 Everyone but you, 'cause you are working. Detective Erico? 
 Go get 'em. 
 Last long weekend, there were 11 high-end B&Es... 
 Total take estimated close to $600,000. 
 Last week, they assaulted a housekeeper when she walked in on them, it's one crew, highly organized. 
 They work with a lookout, carry radios. 
 Alarm goes off, they don't care. 
 They're in and out in four minutes. 
 Want to come over later? 
 I'll scare up a couple of steaks, throw 'em on the Barbie? 
 I'm busy later. 
 Really? But I've already got them. They're filet mignon. 
 Anything to add, Detective Barber? 
 You bet. 
 Uh, one thing you should know is they are dangerous. 
 Housekeeper caught them in the act, and they put the boots to her. So what I suggest to you is proceed with caution. 
 Serve, protect... and grill when you're retired. 
 Go on. Get out there. 
 So has, uh, Noelle let you drive yet? 
 Not yet. 
 Yeah, it's fun. 
 My brother told me about this new sushi place on King, and, well, it's always full. 
 But since the suits are all headed out of town this weekend, get something to eat... 
 You and me? 
 It's not a big deal. 
 I just thought maybe if you were hungry. 
 No, no, it... it sounds fun. 
 It's just I can't 'cause I got plans this weekend. 
 Fine. 
 Sorry. 
 Whatever. 
 Some other time. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 1503, advising on... 
 Go ahead, 1503. 
 Look, no one will pass me. 
 You are so evil. 
 These people are already staring down a barrel of stop-and-go traffic all the way up the 400. 
 Oh, oh, oh! Oh! He didn't go far. 
 Stop it. 
 You involved with Callaghan? 
 I'm just saying, you might want to be a little careful, you know? 
 Callaghan's good, solid police, but, uh, he picks thanks, yeah. I can take care of myself. 
 Ah, the cat who walks by herself. Exactly. 
 The cheese stands alone. 
 You, of all people, should understand that. 
 Stand by for the hotshot. 
 We've got a B&E in progress at 37 Chadwick. 
 The homeowner is in the house and reported that the front door was forced open by a male party. 
 Light it up. 
 1505. We're en route. 
 See ya. 
 Homeowner alone with infant, hiding upstairs, bedroom closet. 
 Says she can hear the intruder downstairs. 
 Okay, hit the gas, Peck. Go. 
 I am. Wait. Is it... is it a left here? 
 No, stop. It's... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be sorry. 
 Home invasion. They'll wait, I guess. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Please be advised. There is a guard dog on the premises. 
 Get around back. Cut him off. 
 Stop! Police! 
 Sam! 
 Could you calm down if I said, "nice boy"? 
 That's it. Nice boy. Nice boy! 
 What the hell are you doing? Get that guy! 
 Okay. 
 All right. Aah! Ow, ow! That hurts. 
 Sure. It's just time's of the essence, so if I could ask you a few questions first... 
 Um, Nash, could you help out Mrs. Wright? 
 Martha. Martha is fine. Here. 
 I have to call Paul. He's at work. 
 I told him it's a long weekend. No one else is going in. 
 So no one knew that you were headed to the cottage today? 
 No. 
 No one else? You didn't stop the newspaper or ask someone to bring in the mail? 
 No, look, it was just for the long weekend. 
 Okay. 
 This guy wasn't that organized. 
 Andy chased him, said he was tripping over the cord of a $90 DVD player. 
 And she couldn't catch him? 
 Well, if it's just one guy, it's not our B&E gang. 
 That crew works in a group. 
 They're pros... and they're sure as hell not gonna be wasting their time on a DVD player. 
 There's no sign of entry or exit from the lower level. 
 This is S1. Let's let Piv handle it from here. 
 Copy. 
 Nothing down here. 
 Of course there's nothing down here. 
 Look, I know it's my fault the guy got away. 
 It's just that there was the dog, and I thought he was gonna hurt you. 
 That's why there's two of us, right? 
 One to deal with the dog, one to get the bad guy. 
 There's no one back there. 
 House is clear. Let's head out. After you. 
 Oh, hey, so I heard you pinned that dog. 
 Those German shepherds... they freak me out. 
 Yeah, bark, bite... dogs don't scare me. 
 Heavy sucker, though. 
 Yeah, so if you make it down by 2:00, then just... just come on in. 
 Okay. Yep. Well, I can't wait. 
 Okay. Bye, babe. Bye. 
 Did you just invite Denise to lunch? 
 Well, you know, it's just everyone's out of town. 
 It's dead. It's not like I'm gonna miss anything if I take her to lunch, so... 
 Except maybe the prime of your life... 
 Moments like I had last night when I realized I was buying drinks trying to decide which one I wanted to take home, and then I realized I didn't have to choose. 
 It's Detective Erico. 
 I need a good cop. Anyone free? 
 For an interrogation? 
 Pawnshop owner, interview three. 
 Tried to sell Boyko a $50,000 Rolex on the cheap. 
 We traced it back to one of our B&Es. 
 Boyko was in a pawnshop? 
 A watch costs $50,000? 
 Diaz, huh? 
 You're looking particularly good to me. 
 Can I... 
 You can watch. 
 I need... 
 Big boy's in there saying he's gonna have a heart attack if I ask him any more questions. 
 Thought I'd give him a couple minutes. 
 To do what? 
 We're primates. 
 So? 
 Chris doesn't believe in evolution. 
 So primates can't stand to be alone. 
 Stick a monkey in a cage by himself for a couple of days, he'll cuddle with a kleenex. Couple weeks, he'll droop and die. 
 Well, what if he does? 
 Does what? 
 Well, you know, have a heart condition or something. 
 He's not gonna have a heart attack. 
 He's not even short of breath. 
 The guy's lying out of his ass. 
 Just go in there and cuddle, Diaz. 
 I don't care if it was one guy or 20 guys, you cannot leave me alone here. 
 Ma'am, the suspect's long gone. 
 I haven't even reached my husband yet. 
 Please don't go... at least until he gets home. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 Officer McNally can stay with you. 
 Well, armed B&E is a two-officers minimum. 
 He wasn't armed. 
 Fine. Nash can stay with McNally. 
 Well, can I ride back with you, sir? 
 Because Officer Shaw's gone back to the barn. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 This is your occurrence number, ma'am. 
 Insurance is gonna want that. 
 Can I get you a soda or something? 
 How the hell's that gonna help? 
 Yeah. It is hot in here. 
 Uh, it's not just in here, though. 
 It's, uh, it's the whole office. 
 We're still finessing the art of interrogation. 
 That's why I wanted a rookie. 
 I needed to get a baseline on this guy, see how he acts when he's not threatened. 
 Toad on a lily pad. 
 He's barely moving... conserving his energy for his big show. 
 I told you, I get chest pains. 
 Oh, look at you. You're a mess... stuttering about a heart attack, squirming. 
 Turn off the cameras. 
 Uh, I don't think we're supposed to... 
 Turn them off. 
 This one's a rookie. 
 Likes to play by the rules. 
 Okay, Ronald... 
 I'm gonna hook you up to a lie detector. 
 There's no lie detector in here. 
 I'm the lie detector. 
 You know, you can't turn the cameras off. 
 You see me? I'm not new. 
 I've been doing this for about 11 years. 
 Somewhere along the way, I realized I can do whatever I like. Stand up! 
 I think I want an attorney. 
 I... I... I don't know where they get the stuff. 
 Oh! Okay, okay. They told me today there'd be a load of silver and China. 
 Silver from where? 
 I don't know. They don't tell me. 
 Ron! 
 Please don't lie to me! What kind of silver? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. Uh, bowls, um, trays, salad tongs. 
 Last time I got... 
 I got two bread makers still in their boxes. 
 Sorry, it's just... kind of sounds like they're robbing a wedding. 
 You know what? 
 Kind of does. 
 Sweetie, please. 
 I heard something breaking. I called 9-1-1. 
 The guy was right downstairs. 
 No, I'm... look, could you just come home? 
 No, he's not here anymore, but, um... 
 Can't you tell your client it's the long weekend? 
 Oh, my God. Come home already. 
 What kind of workaholic is this guy? 
 The douche bag kind. 
 I guess he figures she's got the dog to keep her safe. 
 Yeah, a lot of good that did. The dog didn't even bark at the guy who broke in this morning. 
 Did I tell you Gail asked me to go for Sushi? 
 I think, as, like, friends. 
 What? 
 Cold fish with Gail? Go figure. 
 My husband might be a while. 
 Um, okay. 
 Uh, maybe we should do an inventory, see what's missing. 
 He wants me to drive to the cottage without him... 
 The baby, the dog, just me. 
 You'd think he could take the weekend, right? But no. 
 And then some loser breaks into my house, and... 
 Sorry. I'm... 
 Excuse me. 
 That was Leo's day care, and it's a long weekend, so they're having a half day. And I don't know... 
 Maybe I forgot, but I don't think that I forgot, but I... 
 Okay, Traci, calm down. 
 I can't get ahold of her. 
 Fine. Go. I'll be fine on my own. 
 Half-hour, I swear. I'll be right back. 
 Okay, I'll tell the station. 
 No, no, no, no. Please, please. 
 If you tell them I'm gone, they're gonna ask why. 
 They're not gonna ask why, but I gotta say something. 
 Andy, look around. Do you see a lot of women on this job... a lot of moms with a kid juggling this job? 
 Leo is sitting there. I gotta go. 
 Go. 
 Half an hour. I swear. Thank you. 
 I'd better check on the baby. 
 Do you... do you mind coming upstairs with me? 
 Sure. 
 I don't even know what a bread maker is, and you're like, bread maker equals wedding? 
 It... it wasn't the bread maker. It was the salad tongs. 
 Yeah, me and Denise... that's what we'd always get people as a wedding gift... you know, silver ones, get 'em engraved, uh, "may these be your salad days," love, Chris and Denise. 
 Still don't really know what that means, but... 
 Good news, bad news. 
 Uh, good news is there really is only one wedding scheduled for today in Rosedale, so that kind of narrows it down. 
 Bad news? 
 Thanks to boy genius here, we gotta stake it out, which could be a total waste of the day. 
 A stakeout? Are you serious? 
 "We" as in all of us"? 
 You boys up for it? Could be, uh, could be kind of dangerous. 
 No stranger to danger, man. 
 Yeah, we're... we're totally up for it, sir. 
 All right, well, good. Suit up. 
 Sir, wouldn't we be a more intimidating presence in our uniforms? 
 Yeah, Diaz... 
 You, uh, would be a couple of uniform cops walking into the house that's presumably being watched by our bad guys. 
 Nobody is gonna take a second look at a couple more guests buttons in the front... tags in the back. 
 Come on! 
 "Human lie detector." That was amazing. 
 I thought you couldn't turn off the cameras. 
 You can't. She didn't. That was just some random remote. 
 Hey, did you see the way Erico looked at you? 
 You propose to Denise, you might miss out on your very own what kind of jerk robs a wedding? 
 Who cares? We're going undercover. 
 Where is Leo? 
 So sorry, Ms. Nash, but we had to lock up. 
 You locked him in? 
 We called his Dad. 
 Do you mind? 
 Excuse me? Your g-u-n is in my son's face. 
 What do you mean, you called his Dad? 
 You're an hour late. 
 So you just handed my kid over to Dex? 
 Please move. I don't think it's appropriate you wearing a g-u-n to pick up a child at this daycare. okay, lady, this g-u-n is safety holstered, and the trigger guard is on. I have it because it is my j-o-b. 
 So your partner has a child? 
 Sorry. 
 How does she manage, being a cop and taking care of a kid? 
 Um, well, we're sort of new, so I guess she doesn't really know yet. 
 I can't imagine. When I was your age, I didn't know what I was doing, let alone how to do it with a baby. 
 Oh, you have another kid? 
 Yeah. He's 22 now. 
 Never really got along with Paul. 
 Noah didn't make it very easy... juvenile, drugs. 
 Paul paid for rehab. Right after Noah got out, he ended up in Quinley's. 
 Prison? 
 Three years, trafficking. Crystal meth. 
 It's... well, you love your kid, no matter what. 
 Yeah, prison... it's tough. 
 How's he doing? 
 Swarek. 
 Mrs. Wright has a son from a previous marriage... 22. Uh, he was locked up a couple years ago for trafficking. 
 She doesn't tell us this at the scene? 
 Well, he's still in prison, but could you just check anyway? 
 Noah Davis, born 1988. 
 
 
 
 About damn time. 
 Sorry? 
 You boys better have David. I mean, come on. 
 My daughter's headed to the altar, and there's no groom? 
 Mr. Burton, we believe your house may be the target of a robbery this afternoon. Can we come in? 
 Uh, you... you lost you... your groom? 
 I'm here with Mr. Burton. I'll keep you posted. 
 Over and out. 
 I swear, they get younger every year. 
 Man. "Over and out." 
 Hey, you know what I would do if I was gonna knock infiltrate the alarm company? 
 You're kidding, right? Get a job to do a job? 
 I'd walk up. I would knock, flash my badge, and I'd tell them that we think their house is about to get robbed. 
 I was on my way there to get him. 
 It's not problem. Just glad you're here. 
 We're about to head out to the cottage. 
 Well, maybe you could take Leo along. 
 Jeez, Traci, I don't know. 
 I mean, it's della's parents' place, and... sorry, okay? 
 Just, it's the long... 
 Weekend, I know. 
 Well, I gotta get back to work, so maybe you could just go get me my child. 
 Hey, what'd you get? 
 Noah Davis was released from prison on Saturday. 
 Might want to tell his mom to keep better track of him. 
 Well, did he get released to anyone? 
 According to his parole officer, uh, he's staying with a guy named... What? 
 Sean Spruitt. 
 Sean Spruitt. 
 At 16 Nicholas Street. 
 16 Nicholas Street. Smart money says he's our runner. 
 We're on our way there now. 
 Great, okay. 
 All right. 
 Get to the church already. 
 Good. So you think these thieves are gonna try the old, we're making a delivery" routine? 
 Not if they know everybody's gone. 
 If it were me... throw on a mask, knock down the front door, in and out, five minutes. 
 Well, but, Jess, you have bigger balls than the average criminal. 
 50 bucks says that they show up decked out like... party rental delivery guys. 
 Double it. These guys are pros. 
 Oh, yeah? All right, well... 
 Bam. 
 Wow. I might have to hit an A.T.M. 
 We're taking pictures, for God sakes. 
 Look at you. Take a little responsibility. 
 No, I'm sorry, baby. It was last-minute. 
 They think these guys are breaking into houses while everyone's away at the church for the wedding. 
 Yeah. Well, so we're staking it out. 
 What she sees in you, I have no idea, but, son, you'd better deliver... 
 Not just today but for the rest of your life! 
 Yes... sir. 
 No, I don't know how long. 
 Baby, this is... this is gonna be huge. 
 I just... Denise? 
 I guess Denise really had her heart set on lunch, huh? 
 So where's Noah? 
 You think I'm funny? 
 You're the guy the dog took down, right? 
 I am that guy. How come you're not? 
 Noah brought doggy treats. He didn't need 'em. 
 The dog just wagged his tail and jumped all over him. 
 Man, I never could understand why people let dogs lick their face. 
 Yeah, me neither. Where's Noah? 
 I don't know, man. Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey. I... I was just along for the ride, man. 
 Noah said if I could get us past the alarm, I could take whatever I wanted. 
 So, uh, Rob mom and Dad... that was Noah's brilliant plan, huh? 
 They wasn't supposed to be there. 
 Anyhow, it's not his Dad. It's his stepdad. 
 He really hates the guy... edible thing. 
 Edible? Yeah, you know, loves mommy, wants to kill daddy. That thing. So where's Noah now? I don't know. Cops came. Dog went all ape. I ran. Noah was in the basement. You took off, but Noah didn't? I have no idea, man. For all I know, he's still down there. Why wouldn't he call me? Why wouldn't he tell me he was out? Well, I mean, you... After the whole rehab fiasco, Paul sort of made it clear it was either him or Noah. But still... Martha, I'm home! I'm up here, honey! Tell me they didn't get the video camera. That camera was brand-new. This is who they sent? You called 9-1-1, they sent her? Actually, there were a lot of officers and cars here, but I was left to keep Mrs. Wright company until you came home. You clowns didn't catch the guy, did you? Amazing. Nice work. Paul! You'll wake her. Should've known. So they let you out. Let me guess... um, good behavior? Stay away from me. Well, genius, you're headed right back there now. Did you, uh, do you want to say hi to your mother first? Leave me alone. What's the matter? What's the matter? You're scared to see her, huh? Is that it? Yeah, let me go. You little punk! Stealing my stuff. What now, huh? Off to get high? Right, your house, your wife, your stuff... I told you to leave me alone. Police! Don't move. Noah! What are you doing?! Nobody move! Noah! Come on, McNally. Come on, pick up! Mom, I just need you to take him till after I finish shift. Buddy, hey, you're gonna be at your Dad's next weekend, okay? All weekend. Thank you. Thanks, mom. Thanks, okay. Yeah, I'll see you in five. Thanks. Who's that lady with daddy? That's... your Dad's friend who has a cottage. Nash. Get everyone out of the house. I think the son's still in there. I'm not there. What the hell you mean, you're not there? Where are you? What do you think of me now, Paul? You wouldn't dare. Noah, put the gun down. Oh, big man. You got my gun. You even know how to fire it? Noah, please put the gun down. I'll show you. What are you doing, Paul? I hate you! Don't make this worse than it already is. Stop talking, okay? Don't you see? It's Noah's job to make things worse. Paul, stop it. That's how he gets her attention. Noah, listen to me. You can't solve this with a gun. you don't know what he's done to my mom. Noah, this is not Paul's fault! You treat the dog better than you treat me! I love you! Come on. You're a drug addict, a criminal. You think she wants you around? Let the woman have a fresh start already. Would you shut it? Noah, your mother loves you. Okay, she may be mixed up, but she loves you. Don't give me that, okay? I do! You know that I do! 'Cause you don't know. You don't know. Yeah? You think I don't know? I was abandoned in the middle of the night by my mother. Okay, she has an entirely new family, and I was completely erased. It messes you up. I know. I haven't seen my mother in 14 years. Your mother is right here. Don't do this. Come on. Put the gun down. Please, Noah. Just put it down. It's okay. Put down the gun. I'm sorry. Stop! Paul! In my house? You piece of trash! Don't hurt him! Paul, stop it! How do you like that? No! Get your hands off me! Be quiet! I've got the gun, sir. Don't move. I need E.N.S. on scene at 37 Chadwick. Paul, are you hurt? Hear anything, boys? No. You guys see anything? Uh, not so far. This is one sleepy street. And to think my day started out so well. Huh? Oh, yeah. Flight attendants. So what did you even do with those two girls? Well, that was the beautiful thing with these two girls. Kid's radio's on. He must be sitting on it. Yeah, every rookie does it once. I never did. I mean, they were running the show, totally and completely. Wasn't up to me. Are you lying? I mean, these girls... They really know how to take charge. That's what I'm trying to say. That's what you're missing out on. I hope I'm making myself clear, because flight attendants... In charge. You're doing the hand thing, I'm not lying. Yes. No, I'm not lying. I slept over. I knew... you slept over? Yeah, I slept over. It was late. They were hungry. They got some food, and then they had to catch a flight. You're so full of it. Okay, whatever. When was the last time you had a threesome with two smokin' hot chicks? Have you ever even slept with somebody who wasn't Denise? See the look on that groom's face today? You have slept with someone other than Denise, right? He had the 1,000-yard stare. You haven't, have you? I made out with Krista Bloom in the 11th grade, when Denise and I were broken up. Oh. Okay, good. That's going in the vault. Okay. I... have you? I don't think I can propose to her. Oh. What's... has your radio been on this whole time? It's go time, rookies. Suspects are on the scene. Looks like three bodies. Okay, boys, bodies coming in. Take down, take down! Let's go. Police! Don't move! Shaky? I'm fine. Sometimes things go sideways. It's not your fault. Yeah. What a cluster. Where's Nash? Um... what, you telling me Nash isn't here? Where the hell is she? Ask her. What happened? Do you not know the number one rule  is never, ever leave your partner? Never leave your p... whose is that? That's my son. Kid breaks into my house, pulls a gun on me,  you put me in handcuffs? This is a nightmare. Boyko's gonna have my badge. I'm great. Thanks for asking. Whoa. Hey. Hey, what? You left me alone. I... I didn't know. The house was clear. Except it wasn't. You said you were fine. Well, good thing I was, huh? Well, yeah. You never need anything. You don't need anyone. Good job. Me? I'm about to get fired. Congrats. Whatever. I'm trying to sort out exactly what happened. It's my fault, sir. I left my rookie at the house when we dissolved the perimeter. I was under the impression that the house had been cleared. What gave you that impression? We'd searched it. Noah knew the house. I mean, he knew exactly where to hide. Officer McNally, I need to understand how the hostage situation developed. Like I said, sir, my gun wasn't loaded. I forgot to load my gun this morning. You're not the first. It happens. That's why you have a partner. Let me tell you something about partners, okay? You back 'em up, no matter what. I know that. You know that? So why'd you let Nash dangle back there? Boyko's gonna be very unhappy. Yeah, well, she... Yeah. You knew she was leaving, right? You must've told her it was okay. Look, I get it, okay... what you said to that kid. Your mother left you. You felt abandoned. Now you want to stand alone. But in this job, you can't do it alone. You have to have each other's back. You stand behind your partner always. ♪ it's not like ♪

♪ sad ♪ You gonna run, or, uh, should I cuff you? You should probably cuff me. I'm really sorry about this morning. It's just... things get heavy, and I start to get vulnerable, and so I... I take off, every time. So you're a cop with intimacy issues. Join the club. Look if it doesn't work for you, you don't have to sleep over. Perfect. Then we'll just have s*x in your car. Or we could go to your place. Or we don't have to sleep at all. Go to the penny. Laugh with your friends. It'll be better tomorrow. Oh, yeah? It always is. Go on. Get out of here. ♪ and I'm turning over ♪ 
♪ on love ♪ Three members of our B&E gang locked up, and it's only Friday. Hey, hey, hey. Look who it is. Look who it is. It's the one-hit wonder. No, I'm... I shouldn't interrupt. You guys are probably gonna have a threesome. So what are you gonna do? What can I do? It's gonna be all over the division by tomorrow morning. No, I meant about Denise. Are you still gonna propose? Can we not talk about that? Why? Don't do it, man. I know, okay. I'm young. I have my whole life ahead of me. We already talked about... No, it's... it's not that. If you get married, then you're gonna have kids, and you're gonna split up, and your kids are gonna have to go back and forth every weekend, living out of their knapsack. Divorce sucks. The word is that Diaz is on... uh, is on a, uh, deadline. The man is not into comparison shopping. I can respect that. Well, I can, too. But Timmins, huh? Indeed, indeed. What is wrong with you guys? Hey, guys. Oh, hey, Denise. Let me introduce you. I've heard so much about you. Uh, this is Dov. Uh, Denise... That's... that's Gail. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Uh, have you seen Andy? Yeah, she's right... she... okay. What's his name? What? Your son. H... he's a good-looking kid. What... what's... what's his name? Leo. Leo. Huh. Well, that's funny, because I'm a Leo. You know, I... I like kids. L... love them. I... I like the, um, the zoo, you know? And I like, um... You know? Great. Thanks. You want a drink? No, no, I... I can't. I got Leo tonight. Uh, I just... I just... I wanted to thank you for going back in and talking to Boyko. I should never have left you alone. I told you to go. It's fine. The thing about juggling is, at some point, you always end up dropping the ball. Trace, you didn't drop the ball. You were there for your kid. I mean, that's the most important thing. You think it gets any easier? I have no idea.
