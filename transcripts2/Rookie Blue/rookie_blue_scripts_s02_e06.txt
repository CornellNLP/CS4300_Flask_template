 You reached Detective Luke Callaghan, please leave a message after the beep. 
 Hi, Luke, it's me. I guess we should probably talk. 
 It's been a couple of days and not that I'm a rules girl but uh, you know, it's starting to feel kind of weird so uh. 
 I know things are complicated for you, probably just trying to figure stuff out and... 
 Just call me all right? We really need to decide what we're gonna do next. 
 Okay, yeah. Thank you for calling. 
 All right, bye. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 When were you at the Edinboro Hotel? 
 Why? 
 You left your credit card there. 
 Well, maybe you can pick it up for me When you go for your day at the spa. 
 Seriously? 
 Surprise. 
 What? 
 That is so nice of you. I... 
 I feel really bad, actually. I should be getting you something... since it's your first day back on the job. 
 Let's get married. 
 We are. 
 Yeah, I don't wanna wait. 
 Let's go to city hall next week, throw a big party afterwards. 
 What do you think? 
 Well, I think the girl in me says I don't have a dress. 
 Okay, let's get one. Come on. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm great. 
 I just don't wanna wait anymore. 
 Okay. Yeah. What the hell? 
 Sure. Let's do it. 
 Let's get married. 
 Rookie Blue Season 02 Episode 06 
In Plain View 
Original Air Date: July 28, 2011 
 Next week? 
 Let me try that again. Next week?! 
 I knew he was gearing up for something. 
 He went to the cabin on Friday night, and when he got back, just... it was obvious something was on his mind. And then flowers and dinners, spa packages. 
 So where are you doing it? Have you told anyone? 
 No. No, no, no, ,no we're keeping this very small, quiet. 
 Okay, my Dad's outta town, so it's just gonna be the four of us... me, you, Luke, and Jerry. 
 You're gonna be my maid of honor, right? 
 I wouldn't miss it. 
 Okay. 
 What are you guys doing? 
 Just cleaning the place a bit. 
 Make it look a little less, you know, murder-y. 
 You all good, Gail? Can I get you anything? 
 Gail's had paralysis ever since she found out her mom was coming in tonight. 
 Superintendent Elaine Peck. 
 Super nice lady. 
 You don't know her. 
 Yeah, we had Sunday dinner, like, a month ago. She was really great. 
 She kept calling you "Craig." 
 "Craig" is a great name. 
 Well, at least we now know how to make the demon flee... speak the name of thy life giver. 
 "Open City, Open House!" Save it. 
 Brass upstairs wants us to interface with the community. That's what we do. 
 There'll be a lot of press, Community leaders, political types. 
 So I want you all to be here, cleaned up, 19:00 hours. Diaz. 
 Now apparently, Superintendent Elaine Peck will be joining us tonight as well. 
 I'm hoping that, you know, she'll... she'll like what she sees. 
 This is the first one of these for me as staff sergeant, so... 
 I want you guys to look sharp, you know, be sharp. 
 Now keep your noses clean today, okay? 
 Make me look good out there. 
 Why are you so happy? 
 Don't tell me. 
 You're jazzed about the open house. 
 My 6-year-old gets to see where I work, and he's excited. 
 So he gets excited, I get excited. It's an all-around exciting day. 
 I guess he thinks, like everybody else, we play with plastic guns and yell stick 'em up"? 
 I just think it's cool... opening doors and letting people see what it is we really do. 
 You know what tonight's gonna be? 
 A bunch of little old ladies getting fingerprinted for fun, and a bunch of little kids getting souvenir mug shots for the fridge. 
 Nobody actually wants to know what we really do. 
 Nobody really wants to know how the sausages get made. 
 Are they seriously doing souvenir mug shots? 
 Leo would actually really love that. 
 Sam, buddy. 
 No, just a bit of an uh-oh." 
 You know my informant, Marco Forlan? 
 Testifying-against-the-Jameson-Gang Marco Forlan? 
 Yeah. I can't find him. 
 What do you mean? You lost him? 
 No, I didn't  lose  him. I just I can't find him. 
 Look, he refused protective custody. 
 You know, he's a Church Street party boy. It's not my fault. 
 It's a hell of a day to lose your informant. 
 I know. 
 Do you have a last address? Maybe we can do a drive-by. 
 No, I... that's the thing. I-I don't have anything. 
 And now... the prosecutor wants to meet before the trial, And I-I-I can't find their star... Okay, hold on. 
 It's okay. We found him. 
 Yeah. Yeah, look, Forlan wouldn't stay put. He refused custody. 
 No, I know. 
 Yeah. No, I-I know. Believe me, we're doing the best we can. 
 Thanks, buddy. You really made my day. 
 Okay, I'm gonna need you guys to look around for witnesses. 
 That means alleyways, side streets, everything. 
 Sure. 
 Jerry, I think we got something. 
 McNally? 
 A witness was in the restaurant, heard firecracker sounds and breaking glass, looked outside, and saw a red 2-door fleeing the scene. 
 Yeah. Thought it could've been a black male driving, but she couldn't be sure. 
 Okay, well, was there a make or a model? 
 I got partial plates. 
 Yeah, ran 'em. Three hits. One's registered to a Kylie Penrose. 
 She's not black or male, but girl's got a rap sheet, soliciting, drug possession, and wait for it... boys in vice told us she's hooking for the Jamesons. 
 Yeah, buddy. 
 Looks like Forlan is gonna help us out. 
 Thank you. 
 So? 
 Cause of death... three gunshot wounds to the head. 
 Yeah, sharp as always. That's not what I meant. 
 It was a mistake. 
 What? 
 I'm engaged. I'm happy. Never should've happened. 
 That's the story? That's what you're telling yourself? 
 It's the truth. 
 So what now? 
 We just never talk about it again? That's it? 
 I'll take the coroner. You take the witnesses. 
 What are you looking at? I thought that went great. 
 What's your mom doing here? 
 Psych! Totally got you. 
 You are such a loser. 
 What's the big deal? If my mom was superintendent, I'd be detective by now. 
 Yeah. If my mom was your mom, you'd be gay. 
 Dov. 
 Police. Come out of there now. 
 You haven't driven your car today? 
 No. 
 So then who did? 
 No idea. 
 Kylie, someone drove your car today. 
 Well, then someone must've stolen it, because I've been home all morning. 
 Stole it and then brought it back? 'Cause it's right there. 
 That'd be very considerate of them. 
 Maybe your boyfriend took it? 
 My boyfriend's out of town all week. 
 He's not your boyfriend. 
 Shut up, Deena. 
 He's nobody's boyfriend, he's a pimp. 
 Deena, right? Can I use your bathroom? 
 No. 
 What are you doing? 
 It's just great in here. I love what you've done with the place. 
 That's not even the way to the bathroom. 
 Sorry. I got kinda turned around in here. 
 What the hell is he doing? He's not allowed to be in there. 
 Sit down. 
 How old are you? - She's 19. 
 I asked her. 
 I don't think I've done anything wrong. 
 Officer Swarek, I think we might have a problem. 
 I think Deena here might be underage. 
 Thank you, Officer Nash, but, uh, I think we might have a slightly bigger problem. 
 Especially if this gun killed our witness. 
 We're thinking the girls aren't the shshoters? 
 No way. Jamesons keep their pretty girls working in other areas. 
 But, according to the landlord, this is the guy who pays their bills Darrell Jameson... pimp, gunrunner, family enforcer. 
 Forlan had a lot to say about the guy. 
 Darrell must've heard. 
 Where's Darrell? 
 Sam's out looking for him. 
 He knows a guy who knows a guy. 
 We find Darrell, connect the girls with the gun, we're good to go. 
 What about the kid in the box? 
 He hasn't said anything since we brought him in. 
 Well, he better start talking fast. You need to get on top of things before... 
 How do you set up a conference call on this thing? 
 All I did was press a couple of buttons, and now I think the whole division's on hold. 
 I lost my Blackberry... fifth one this month, second one this week. 
 And my office is yours, superintendent. You know that. 
 Our office needs an air freshener. 
 You need me to help you dial out? 
 I need you to tell me how to tell the chief that we lost a major witness in an upcoming gang trial. 
 Today, of all days. 
 We do have two known accomplices in custody. 
 We have detectives canvassing the city. 
 We're completely on top of things. 
 Frankie, I know what. 
 You get the bad guys, and I'll make it sound good. 
 We'll get it done. 
 I know you will, Because there is no other option, is there? 
 Now do you mind if I steal my sweetheart for a second? 
 You're as quiet as a mouse. 
 "Frankie"? 
 I'm just glad she's on our side... I think. 
 This is you. 
 Can I have some water, please? 
 We'll, uh, hold the girls for 24 hours. 
 Resisting arrest. Gun's at ballistics. 
 Is there a warrant I'm not aware of? 
 Well, Sam said the gun was in plain view. 
 In plain view plain view or a plain view for Sam? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. What are we doing? 
 We're hunting. We go after the weakest member of the pack. It's Deena. 
 You want me to get Callaghan? 
 Actually, uh, take McNally. 
 Give the girl someone to relate to. 
 Smile. 
 Bit bigger. 
 Less. We're not going for scary" here. 
 Which button do I press? 
 The one with the camera on it. 
 Okay. E-mail it to your father. He's forgotten what you look like. 
 Speaking of what you look like are we done? 
 Well, I don't know, Gail. You tell me. You haven't impressed me so far. 
 Okay. Well, then let's do it. 
 When you were rookie, you broke the record for collars. 
 I know, because I dusted the trophies, I shined your medals. 
 I just don't want you to look up 20 years from now, married to some okie from Muskogee who's still on the doughnut patrol, and wonder how the hell did I get here and why didn't my mother push me just when I needed to be pushed the most? 
 Anyway... I'm gonna be doing interviews tonight at this open house thing, and I thought it would be great if we did them together. 
 Two generations of Peck policing. Sound good? 
 Yeah. Sounds great. 
 Okay. 
 You know, you should actually do something about your hair. 
 Come on, son.You can... you can talk to us. We're the police. You know, the... 
 We're the police. 
 He's a kid, not an alien. 
 A really cool kid. lsn't that right? 
 Up high. Come on. I said "Up high." Come on. Gimme five. 
 Elaine. 
 No? 
 I mean, Superintendent Elaine, uh, Peck. 
 Superintendent, Officer Dov Epstein. Pleasure. 
 The meth lab bust. 
 Outstanding work, officer. Excellent initiative. 
 Is this your witness? 
 Yeah, so we should probably just get back to work. 
 What do you have so far? 
 I'm making excellent progress. 
 Nothing, ma'am. No. Not a word. 
 Officer cool kid isn't really working. 
 It'd help if I had some backup. 
 It would help if you were cool. 
 Mom, I got this. 
 I'm great with kids. 
 Did you see... The bad man? Pow! Pow! 
 There's your answer. Call Children's Aid. You're done with him. 
 It's nice working with you boys. 
 I'm just gonna go over. 
 I gotta say, your mother, excellent judge of character and surprisingly good with children. 
 Okay, I'm gonna take you... 
 Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? 
 So, uh... Is this the room where you get all the confessions and stuff? 
 Sometimes. 
 Can we talk about this morning? 
 What about it? 
 Whose gun is it? Where'd it come from? 
 No idea. 
 We know about Darrell. We know who he is and what he makes you do. 
 Darrell doesn't make me do anything. I do it for us. 
 "Us"? 
 Me and Darrell. We love each other. 
 We're actually getting a place together. 
 You know, one of those condos that they're building down at the lake, the new ones? 
 We were actually there last week and we're picking out kitchen tiles. 
 And I like the little glass ones, but he's more of a limestone kinda guy so Officer McNally? I'd like a second with Deena. 
 Got a record there. 
 How's your first day back? 
 Lucky you. You got to see me get kicked out of my own interview. 
 Yeah, don't take it personally. She has her own rhythm. 
 So... Darrell Jameson. 
 We already know what happened. 
 He borrowed Kylie's car, he went out, shot a guy, came back to your place, dropped off the car, hid the gun. 
 All we need you to do is confirm it. 
 Mindy Karkanis, 18 years old. 
 I think Mindy was from Oakville. 
 Megan Stanheight, 17. I don't know where Megan was from. 
 What are you doing? 
 Just showing you some of Darrell's last few girlfriends. 
 No. It... 
 There's no way. He wouldn't actually do that. So... 
 Bad Johns, bad dope, bad luck. 
 This is the life Darrell is gonna give you. This is where it leads. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, door number one... 
 We bust you for the gun, whatever else we can find, you get out in a couple of years, Darrell's moved on, you end up like one of the girls in the picture. 
 Or you tell us what we already know, we take care of you, we put you up in a hotel, we fly you someplace safe. 
 Then you take it from there. 
 I mean, you might even have a chance at a life worth living. 
 So who are waiting for? 
 Lionel Jameson... one of Darrell's cousins by marriage. 
 And when's he getting here? 
 Any minute. Guy keeps junkie time. 
 When's that? 
 When it's no-dope o'clock. 
 Yeah, you're, uh, not supposed to drink it. 
 You can get any drug you want in there. 
 What you can't get's a decent cup of coffee. 
 Hey Lionel! 
 What you want, man? 
 I just want to talk. 
 Talk about what? I'm I'm clean. I'm not using anything. 
 That's great news. What are you doing here? 
 I'm going to a coffee shop to get some coffee. 
 Have mine. 
 Look, man, I gotta go, man. I got places to be, a'ight? 
 Okay, well, th-that's perfect. We'll give you a ride. 
 We can give you a ride. No problem. That's right. 
 Just five minutes. 
 Deena, what's going on? 
 They're not letting me go. 
 It's entrapment. It's coercion. It's... it's entrapment and coercion. 
 It's crap! That's what it is. 
 You have to call Darrell. 
 You know what? That's enough. 
 We'll get you out, sweetie. I promise. 
 I said that's enough! 
 What is coercion anyway? I heard you say that. 
 I don't even know what it means. 
 Deena, you did great. She bought it. 
 I know it doesn't really feel very good. 
 It's okay. You're doing the right thing. 
 We gotta move quick. When Darrell finds out she's not coming back... 
 So how long do I gotta stay outta town for? 
 It could be a while. You're definitely gonna be safe. 
 We've got you on an 8:00 A.M. flight to Halifax. Someone'll meet you at the airport. 
 What do you mean? Who's meeting me? 
 We're trying to reach your family. 
 Not my mom. Don't call her. 
 Well, Deena, you have to stay with somebody. 
 Yeah, but it doesn't have to be my mom. 
 We can, we can call my sister and her boyfriend. 
 They live just outside the city, and they have a new baby. It's really cute. 
 She's just like a doll. 
 Okay. Yeah, we can do that. 
 Detective? 
 After you give her your statement, you and I are gonna go to a motel outside the airport for the night. 
 Can you come, too? Please? 
 No. Sorry. She can't. 
 Maybe we should get someone who's just coming on shift. 
 It could be a long night. 
 Would that make you happy? 
 Yeah. 
 If that's good with you, McNally. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah. We'll make it a girls' night it could be fun. 
 
 
 
 Okay, McNally, we need to keep all the, uh, inside doors open in case we need to get her outta here fast. 
 Okay. 
 How are the sight lines from the window? 
 Parking lot, cars. Got a 180-view of the only road. 
 Good. So we can see who's approaching, Keep this place secure. 
 Do I have to sleep on these beds? The sheets look kinda uggy. 
 Darrell said that he would get me Egyptian cotton ones When we got our place together. 
 Apparently, those are the best. 
 Okay, well, um, once we get settled, I'll go out, see if I can find some sheets that are less uggy. 
 He says he heard some noise but didn't see anybody. 
 Okay, he says that, uh, he doesn't know his adoptive parents' names. 
 A big house, something about a bike they got him. 
 You ask him how he got out on the street? 
 What he's saying is, um, he ran away because they didn't want him or left him. I'm not 100%. 
 You want this? 
 What is that? 
 Don't touch him. He'll freak. 
 Ask him to roll up his sleeve. 
 Now ask him where he got that. 
 He says someone tied him up. 
 You want to get a movie? 
 If the city won't spring for it, I will. 
 I'm fine. All right? I'm okay. 
 Detective? 
 She said she's okay. I'm okay. I think we're all okay. 
 Don't stand by the window, Deena. 
 Did you guys get ahold of my sister? 
 She's supposed to pick us up at the airport, right? 
 But I know she's working days... 
 Actually, she said that's not gonna work out, but we talked to your mom and... 
 No. No way. 
 Deena, we need to get you someplace safe. 
 Well, that place is not with my mom. 
 I actually think I would feel better with Darrell. 
 Yeah, well, your mom's not trying to kill you. 
 You know what? I'm outta here. This was stupid. 
 This whole thing was just stupid. 
 No, Deena. Okay, what do you want? What can we do? 
 I want...I don't want this. 
 Okay, well, what do you want? 
 I want... I want to be someplace nice with people who don't hate me. 
 Okay, well, this is just for now. 
 And things'll happen for you. It'll get better. 
 When? 
 Now, 'cause we're gonna get a movie and or I mean, I can go out and get some magazines. 
 What kind of magazines? 
 Celebrity magazines or... 
 I don't know. I can get some wedding magazines. 
 I'm getting married in, like, a week. I have about a day to pick out a dress. 
 Wanna help me? 
 Are you sure you don't want one? 
 I just... I just need to get outta here, man. 
 And you will, as soon as you tell us where we can find your cousin Darrell. 
 These are actually pretty good, you know, cold and sweet. 
 I didn't even know I wanted one till right this second. 
 Oh, god. Oh, god. Just... I'm not feeling too good, man. 
 Well, maybe you need to score. 
 I don't do that anymore. I'm clean, okay? 
 I get it. Whatever lie you need to tell yourself to get through the day, man. 
 It's true, okay, man? 
 Great. I'm really happy for you, buddy. I am. 
 I don't feel good about this. 
 About what? 
 We're just taking an old friend for a drive. 
 Hey Lionel, when was the last time you took a ride out to the country? 'Cause we got all day. 
 Come on, man! Look, I don't know anything, okay? 
 They don't tell me anything anymore. 
 Come on. You're Darrell's cousin. He loves you. 
 Look, dude, I don't know. They're going legit or something. 
 That's all they tell me. I don't know, man. 
 What do you mean, legit? 
 The dude's buying up, like, four condos under his mother's name. 
 Why don't you guys try looking there? Maybe that's where he's hiding, okay? 
 I mean, that's where I'd go. They're pretty sweet. 
 In downtown where? 
 It's by the lake or something. I swear to God that's all I know, guys. Please just let me out. 
 Nice work, Officer Nash. 
 All right. Nice. 
 Chief, I told you that we had everything under control, and yet still you worried. 
 I have to say, that hurt my feelings, offended me on a professional level. 
 Well, my division could use some new communications equipment. 
 These phones are a hundred years old. 
 Okay. I'll take that as a compliment. 
 Craig. 
 Did that hurt? 
 No pain here, superintendent. Just... 
 Well, good. Could you get me another cup, then 'cause I don't like mine all drippy. 
 Yeah, sure. Sorry. 
 Wait. I'll walk with you. 
 So Gail said you haven't decided where you're going after 15 Division. 
 Yeah, well, you know, I'm just really happy here, you know, doing what I'm doing, for now... 
 But I, uh, definitely have thoughts. 
 What about Gail? Has she said what she's planning? 
 It's something you probably wanna ask her. 
 But I'm asking you. 
 Yeah, I just don't know lf she'd be cool with me telling you about her. No offense. 
 Who said you needed to tell her? 
 Superintendent, that was the chief's executive assistant. 
 Apparently, we're getting getting new communications tech. 
 We'll talk later. 
 You know, Chris, you really should think more about what you want. 
 And don't listen to Gail. I can be very helpful, maternal, even. 
 Sweet. 
 All right, she's gonna take a bath. 
 I'm gonna go head out and get those magazines. 
 Did we really call her sister? 
 You know, sometimes you say a thing just to get the job done, you know, like, "it'll happen for you. Things are gonna get better." 
 I actually believe that. 
 Fine. 
 Department'll get the magazines. Just, just let me... 
 Edinboro Hotel. 
 Is it nice? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. When were you there? 
 Friday. We went on a stakeout. 
 With who? 
 Just me, spin team. 
 Luke? 
 What? 
 Were you with Luke? 
 No. 
 His credit card was there. 
 Well, he might have stopped by. 
 On his way to the cabin? 
 Sure. 
 So he did go to the cabin. 
 If that's what he told you. 
 Did something happen with you guys? 
 Jo, did something happen?! 
 Just go. Get your magazines. 
 Just go. Okay? Just go. 
 You've reached Detective Luke Callaghan. Please lea... 
 Kid's asleep in Jerry's chair. 
 According to Gregor, he was in a Russian orphanage up until last year. 
 But the marks on his wrist are fresh. Must've happened here. 
 Anyway, I'm sure Children's Aid will look into it. 
 You did call Children's Aid, right? 
 Gail, your mo- Superintendent... 
 You always do what your mama tells you? 
 Okay. Apparently, his last name is Adinocki. 
 Odinochka. 
 What he said. 
 How do I spell that? 
 What happened? 
 That little bitch hit me! 
 Where is she? 
 I don't know. 
 Where did she go? 
 I don't know! 
 I checked the perimeter. I can't find Deena. 
 The door was locked. I busted in. I was worried she was hurting herself. 
 Yeah, towel rack. 
 Yeah, resourceful girl. 
 McNally We need to find Deena. 
 Why? She's not gonna testify now. 
 Well, Darrell doesn't know that. 
 He just knows that she didn't come home, Which means that she snitched. Which means he's gonna kill her. 
 Has the girl called anyone yet? 
 We cloned her phone when she was in interview with Rosati. 
 So I'm calling the spin team right now. 
 We got all available foot patrol checking all known Jameson hangouts... clubs, corners. 
 Two witnesses in one day, same case. 
 I want to be updated every three minutes. 
 Yeah. 
 And I don't want anything out there about her witness testimony. 
 Might as well paint a target on her back. 
 Sam, I got Frank here. Frank. 
 Sam? 
 Informant told us the Jamesons have some properties downtown, possible safe houses. 
 Checked 'em out. 
 No sign of Darrell. 
 We can stick around the neighborhood, see if he shows up. 
 Okay, but keep me posted, a lot. 
 Frank? 
 I have a, um... 
 Superintendent. 
 There's nothing under "Toma Adinocki" because that's not his real name. 
 It wasn't until we... 
 Officer Peck searched the missing persons photos that we found him. 
 Yeah, his real name's Toma Morev. 
 So where did "Adinocki" come from? 
 It means alone." I mean, he either made it up or he got mixed up. I... don't know. 
 Okay, you know what? That's fine. Did he see something or not? 
 No, he didn't. He was hiding. 
 Okay. 
 But we have his parents... his adoptive parents coming in. 
 Why? If it's an adoption issue, that's immigration. 
 If it's abuse, that's special victims. 
 Yeah, well, I'd kinda like to know why they've been tying him up. 
 Children's Aid will find that out, so let's let this go, guys, 'cause I kinda need you out there looking for this girl. 
 I'm just trying to make a collar here. 
 If this is child abuse, and we can prove it, that looks pretty good on 15 and you... especially tonight. 
 Fine. Just remember this when I'm working for you. 
 Absolutely, detective. You were always my favorite. 
 Jerry. 
 If this has anything to do with the Russian kid, I don't care. 
 No, uh, we found her. 
 The girl you're looking for... Deena... we got her. 
 Really. 
 Okay. 
 The, uh, spin team recorded this from Deena's phone... her cell, uh, four minutes ago. 
 At least she's not a criminal mastermind. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Where you at, D.? 
 No, I'm fine. I didn't tell them anything, though, I swear. I just, I really want to see you. 
 So let me come get you. 
 They showed me these pictures of, um, these other girls, and they were hurt really bad. 
 Deena, Deena, Deena. Have I ever hurt you? 
 No. I just want us to be together and I want us to have a home together. 
 I know Sweetheart I know. Let's just talk about it, all right? At our new place. 
 Remember the park where our kids are gonna play, you know, where we made those wishes? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 What the hell park are they talking about? 
 Any units have information on possible whereabouts of missing party, please advise S-1 on channel 2. 
 The last condo we saw, one of the Jameson properties... It had a park. 
 Yeah, they all had parks, Nash. 
 But this one had a fountain. 
 Where else do you make wishes? 
 Fine. Let's give it a whirl. But keep it off the radio for now. 
 No leaks until we get her back. 
 Just so you know, the story I'm telling the sarge, you had nothing to do with the witness escaping. 
 It's all on me. 
 That's not a story. That's true. 
 Then I guess we should probably talk. 
 You know, we have a job to do, detective. Let's just do that. 
 Backup units are on their way. 
 Keep all radio chatter on a secure channel and wait for my go. 
 If the girl shows, we pick her up, wait for Darrell to arrive, if he arrives. 
 If Darrell shows first? 
 Take him down as fast as possible. Do what you gotta do. 
 Luke lncoming Call 
 This is Echo One. Status reports? 
 1509. We're en route to the east perimeter. 
 North perimeter is cold. 
 1530. No cars or pedestrians in the southwest lot. 
 Foot patrol, do we have a visual? 
 Foxtrot's a negative on the girl. No eyes on Jameson either. 
 Stand by. 
 Possible visual on the girl. 
 Female entering from the southeast corner. 
 We marked her. McNally and I will approach. 
 We got him. He's alone. Red and black jacket, coming in from the east perimeter. 
 Police! Don't move! Do not move! 
 Police! Get down on your knees! 
 And you have no idea how he got downtown? 
 Do you know how many times he's run away since we brought him over? 
 His therapist said that it's gonna be a long transition. 
 Toma has a therapist? 
 Oh sure. 
 He's got one, my wife has one, I have one. 
 You want one, too? 
 Look, we're asking because if he has a therapist, we would expect to see any reports of physical abuse. 
 It's... 
 What about the marks on his wrists? 
 His therapist calls it the big hug." 
 Apparently Toma has something called reactive attachment disorder. 
 The whole time he was in the orphanage, they barely touched him. 
 Nobody ever spoke to him. He had to survive that. It's not his fault. 
 He screams when you touch him, screams if you even... if you even pat him on the shoulder. 
 He punches. He kicks. 
 Well, none of this is explaining the marks on his wrists. 
 We tried, uh, holding him to us with our arms, but he fought it so hard. 
 He punched. He... he was hurting us. 
 We tied his hands. 
 His therapist said that it was to show him that we love him, and maybe then he could learn to love us back. 
 So, uh, Children's Aid talked to your social worker. 
 This is really stupid 'cause it's not like you understand me. 
 Toma... 
 I-I know this might be really hard to understand, but I think those people actually love you... 
 And I think you might have a chance. 
 You guys ready? 
 Wait. Don't forget this. I don't want you getting lost. 
 You don't have to talk. It's no difference to me. 
 I mean, we've got the, uh... the statement and we've got the gun. 
 So we're good to go, right? 
 Yeah, at this point, all we're talking about is, you know, how much time you're willing to do for your crew... 
 Life, half-life, Maybe less if you're willing to help us out. 
 McNally You don't need me anymore. 
 You found her. She's safe. 
 Deena's refusing to testify. 
 She wants to take the rap for Marco Forlan's murder. 
 Deena, look at me. 
 Look at me. 
 He had a gun. He was going to kill you. 
 He was defending himself. He was defending me. 
 What about the other girls? The other dead girls? 
 It... it doesn't matter. They don't matter. 
 Okay, then what matters? 
 What matters is us, me and Darrell. 
 The gun in the apartment was mine. I shot the guy. 
 I'm 17, so I'm a minor, and... when I get out, we're gonna get a place together. 
 If I talk, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. 
 And if I don't talk, then I'll get out in, like, one year, maybe two, and at least I'll be alive. 
 Alive? 
 How can you possibly believe that? How? 
 After everything you've seen tonight? 
 What I saw was my man, and he was coming to get me, to take me home. 
 I have nothing else to say. I'd like to talk to a lawyer. 
 Andy. 
 What? 
 Do you have a family cottage? 
 No, we just... we just camped in the backyard. 
 We have a place up north. 
 Yeah, it's been in the family, for, like, a hundred years. 
 There was this one summer, I think I was 12 years old my parents and I, we drive into town. 
 I go into a store to get something. I come out, mom and Dad are gone. 
 You find your way home through the woods, on your own. 
 It's a Peck family tradition. 
 Why? 
 I guess they thought it was for our own good. 
 That... sounds horrible. 
 Gail, your mom's looking for you inside, something about an interview. 
 I don't want to go. 
 It's okay. I got this. 
 More and more women are rising through the ranks. 
 Can you excuse us for a second, please? 
 Sorry. Gail's not up to it right now. 
 She'd like to, she really would, but she's tired. 
 You're a good boyfriend, Craig. 
 Actually, it's Chris. 
 I'm sure Gail will appreciate your loyalty... 
 Even if I don't. 
 Andy? 
 Please don't do this. 
 Andy... I screwed up. 
 I made a huge mistake, and I am so sorry. 
 I know. 
 I know 'cause I-I got all your flowers and your dinners and your spa packages. 
 I can only imagine what else I was about to get. 
 Why did you still want to get married? 
 Because I love you. 
 The ring is in the lock box, where I found it.
