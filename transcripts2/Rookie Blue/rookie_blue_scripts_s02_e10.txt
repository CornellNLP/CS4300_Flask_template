 (Siren wailing) 
 This is 1504, on route to intercept. 
 Woman : Copy, 1504. Hope you're enjoying this. 
 Yeah. Why is that? 
 Oh, me and you, driving fast, chasing bad guys. 
 This really might be the last time we do this together. 
 Oh, you miss me already. That's sweet. 
 You're probably not even gonna go. All talk and no action. 
 You want action? 
 Okay, no, what I want is to catch this guy, and you know what? If he's supposed to be on Route 9, we should've seen him by now. 
 Unless he changed his plan. 
 That does happen, just not to you. 
 Huh. 
 (Tires squeal) 
 (Siren whoops) 
 (Car hissing) 
 (Static) This is 1504. We got an 11-80, Route 9, north of exit 56. 
 (Crow cawing) 
 Looks like it rolled, but... 
 (Gasps) (Gunshots) 
 Down! Down! Down! 
 (Panting) You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, you said you wanted action. 
 1504, shots fired. Repeat... shots fired. 
 Route 9, north of exit 56. 
 Request immediate backup. 
 Woman : 10-4. All units... 
 Sam, somebody's in the car. 
 1504 heard shots fired... 
 Route 9, north of exit 56. Available units, please respond. 
 Woman : Oh, my God. 
 Oh. 
 Ma'am, are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 It's just... I-I don't know what happened. I just... 
 You've been in a car accident. Do you remember getting hit? 
 No, not really. 
 I was... I was driving, and a car came flying around... around the bend, and into my lane and... 
 Okay. Do you know your name? 
 Yeah. 
 Leslie Atkins. 
 I'm... I'm fine, though. I'm fine. I'm just... 
 So we gotta get her out of there, all right? 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I just, um, I need help 'cause um, I'm pinned under this... 
 Okay, yep. 
 Okay. Uh, Sam? 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 It's okay. Just relax. Don't worry. It's gonna be fine. 
 Dispatch, we need E.M.S. 
 Got one victim, conscious and breathing, pinned inside her car, serious laceration on her right leg. 
 (Trunk latch clanks) 
 Woman : Copy that, 1504. Working on getting you E.M.S. and fire. 
 What do you mean, "working on it"? 
 How bad is it? 
 Uh, you know, it's pretty... It's pretty, um... 
 It's... it's not that bad. 
 Wow. You're a really terrible liar. 
 Uh, let's just say it's definitely gonna leave a mark. 
 Step one... examine the wound, make sure there's no obvious dirt or debris. 
 Ow! My... sorry. Okay? 
 Leslie, here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait until my partner shows up, we're gonna wrap this up, and then the medics and the fire department are gonna come here and get you out of here. Does that sound good? 
 Yeah, that sounds great. 
 McNally. 
 Great. 
 How's she doing? 
 Laceration's deep. 
 I think her leg might be broken, but it's fairly clean. 
 We got another problem. 
 They got a high-rise fire on East Lakeshore. 
 All fire and medics in the zone are there. 
 What about us? 
 They're sending units from District 3. 
 That's over 20 minutes away. 
 I mean the girl's leg's bleeding like crazy. 
 McNally, you've been trained. You know what to do. 
 Get pressure on the wound, patch it up to stem the bleeding, and do what you gotta do to keep her calm and conscious until the medics get here. Okay? All right? 
 Yes. 
 Where are you going? 
 The debris goes about a hundred yards up. 
 That's where the shots came from. I'm gonna have a look. 
 Here's the bag. 
 (Sets bag down) 
 Okay. 
 Change of plans. 
 What are you talking about? 
 (Panting) 
 Don't worry. 
 It's gonna be fine. 
 Rookie Blue; Season 02, Episode 10 
Best Laid Plans 
Original Air Date:  August 25, 2011 
 (Andy) This is all wrong. What are we even doing here? 
 What is wrong with it? 
 It's a studio, great neighborhood, it's most importantly, in your price range. 
 Yeah, it's facing north. It's not bright enough. 
 You know, this isn't just a condo I'm buying, Traci, it's my future. 
 And my future needs a lot of natural light. 
 (Scoffs) It doesn't even have parking. 
 You don't even have a car. 
 Future me does. 
 Is future you hooking up with Sam Swarek? 
 Inappropriate. 
 You knew it was gonna come up eventually. 
 Luke and I just broke up. 
 Yeah, over a month ago, and I know you're still in mourning, but sometimes the best way to get over somebody is to get under somebody else. 
 Again, completely inappropriate. 
 He's not your training officer anymore. 
 No way.  Okay, those are not in my plans, and I'm still a rookie. 
 And, you know, just getting out of this relationship, I... 
 (Sighs) Gotta lie low and get my act together. 
 How long's that gonna take? 
 (Horn honks) I promise if anything happens, you'll be the first to know. 
 Good, especially if you want to see that bright future of yours. 
 (Laughs) 
 Okay, we gotta get outta here. 
 We have three more places to look at before shift starts. 
 They're all facing South. 
 One of those places is gonna be my new home. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What makes you so sure? 
 Just have a feeling this is gonna be a good day. 
 (Inhales sharply) 
 2 minutes, 30 seconds. 
 I can see the time. Don't need you to keep reminding me. 
 Is that our game console? 
 It's  my  game console. 
 Well, you're erasing all my high scores. 
 We're just using it as a prop. 
 I'm teaching Dov to defuse an I.E.D. 
 Using a controlled blast. 
 Oh. Fun. 
 Sue doesn't think I can do it, but I've already grounded the C-4s in place, and... I got the detonator. 
 Good. Now you just have to secure the det before you're timed out. Oh, boom. You're done. 
 (Mouth full) - But I still have two minutes. 
 You put the detonator in your mouth. 
 If it sparks, it's got enough charge to blow off your face. 
 And I would hate it if something happened to this face. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Console beeps) 
 Oh, it's a remote detonator. 
 I guess you're both dead. 
 (Sets down controller) 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Sam humming) 
 Can't say I miss wearing one of those. 
 (Chuckles) Well, that's 'cause you never made it look as good as I do. 
 Oh. 
 Flattered as I am, uh, tell me you didn't come down here just to watch me suit up. 
 What do you know about James Brennan? 
 Jamie Brennan? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Forget it, man. He's out of the life, has been for years. 
 It's all about the wife and the kid and the 2-car garage in Brampton. 
 Not anymore. 
 Wife and daughter were killed in a car accident two months ago. 
 Intel says Jamie is not doing so well. 
 And you think now might be a good time to try to work him? 
 Sammy, this guy is an enforcer. He's a serious player. 
 This might be our only chance. 
 I'm, uh, putting together a team of guys who know the case. 
 (Clears throat) - When? 
 A couple weeks. 
 (Whispers) - A couple weeks? 
 Got a guy who could make an introduction, get you in the inside, working for him. 
 We'll take it from there. 
 And here's me just getting used to sleeping in my own bed again. 
 As good as you think it makes you look, the uniform's a straitjacket for you. 
 Okay, well, I'm gonna let you think about it. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Officer Nash. 
 Detective Barber. Didn't see your car in the parking lot. 
 Thought you called in sick after your big game last night. 
 What, me? Never. 
 No, I just dropped it off in the shop for a-a little tune-up. 
 What? Stella's feeling a little under the weather? 
 No, I just thought I'd get her shipshape in case, I, you know, sell her. 
 What are you talking about? That car's your baby. 
 It's just a car. 
 Besides, why drive a chick magnet when you already have the woman of your dreams? 
 Very smooth, detective. 
 Oh, you see that? I just exude cool. 
 I don't need a hot sports car. 
 You know, if you have to point it out, it's a lot less cool. 
 Y... you're right. 
 (Laughs) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So you and Sue seem pretty happy. 
 Yeah, we are. She's, uh, she's great. 
 It's good. It's good, you know, the fact that she's E.T.F. doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. 
 I mean, that's... that's something, you know. 
 Nope. Like I said, she's great. 
 (Lock clicks) 
 Dov. 
 Look, about what happened, I just wanna be clear. 
 What do you mean? 
 You don't remember? 
 Why am I not surprised? You were totally high, and it's not like you meant what you said. 
 Of course not. 
 Let's just forget it happened. 
 Okay. 
 That's a good plan. 
 (Buzzer sounds) 
 She's lifted six purses in the last two weeks, so when you bring her in, keep your hands on your wallets. 
 Moving on. I spoke to headquarters this morning about the new squad cars. 
 (Noelle) -  Yes! Bring on the equalizers. 
 Forget about the, uh, equalizers. 
 They say it's not on the budget this year. I know. (Scoffs) 
 It means that we're gonna be driving the same smelly, broke-ass cars for the next year or two. 
 So serve, protect, and drive careful. They gotta last. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Hey, uh... 
 Looks like I'm with Oliver, and you have 1507 with Dov. 
 Yeah, can you switch with me? 
 I wanna... I wanna ride with Oliver. 
 Are you sure? 
 You know you're gonna have to buy him lunch, right? 
 Yeah, I know, I know. 
 And listen to those CDs of his cousin's blues band? 
 Yeah? So? I like them. They're... bluesy. 
 All right. Hey, I'm riding with you. Gail wants to switch. 
 Oh, great. We can go to that restaurant with the bacon-flavored curly fries. 
 Dude, yes. 
 (Oliver) Dude. 
 (Helicopter whirring) 
 That your new place? 
 Yeah. I'm trying to decide between these two. 
 I still think this one feels way more me, though. 
 I know that building. It used to be a toilet factory. 
 Well, it's not anymore. It's actually very nice. 
 It's comfortable, quiet... 
 If you got any problems, just take the back off and rattle the chain. 
 Anyways, I'm going to the bank tomorrow morning. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 First-time buyer, so I get a 4.5% fixed rate on a 20-year mortgage. 
 20 years? 
 What, you think I should do 25? 
 Well, it's just a hell of a commitment. 
 Well, I'm obviously not gonna stay there for 20 years, you know, stay for five, wait till it appreciates, flip it, then move on to another neighborhood, do the same thing, and eventually I'll have my great place in the beaches. 
 Ah, the beaches. 
 Or *** West, you know. 
 5-year plan, 10-year plan. You got it all figured out. 
 Yeah. Plan's good. 
 Bet you were one of those kids that saved her Halloween candy and made it last all year, huh? 
 What, and you were the kid that ate all his candy in one night? 
 No, just the good stuff. Then I threw the rest out. 
 See, you can't do that. You gotta save the good stuff. 
 Save it? What for? For what? 
 I don't know. Later. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 (Crow caws) 
 (Exhales deeply) Okay, so I just need you to look up. 
 What are you doing? 
 Listen, you might have a concussion, so I just need to make sure that your pupils are equal and reacting to light. I just have a couple questions, okay? Okay. 
 Okay. 
 What do you do for a living? 
 I'm a musician. I'm a songwriter. 
 Really? Like, on the radio? 
 Not all songwriters are on the radio. 
 Oh. I guess. 
 I have a bunch of demos. 
 Nothing's 100% finished yet. 
 I don't want to put anything out until it's ready, you know? 
 Yeah, that's totally understandable. 
 Okay, I'm gonna try to clean this up. 
 It might hurt a little bit. Gotta get the glass out, okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right, so, um, what else do you have to do? 
 You know, what's left? 
 I just have to do a couple more tracks... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And then I'm finished probably, like, in the next two months or so. 
 Really? That's right around the corner. 
 I know. 
 (Panting) 
 Yeah. 
 I have this really amazing bottle of champagne just sitting in my apartment, waiting for me, to celebrate when I'm done. 
 Well, that's gonna taste great. 
 Yeah. 
 Why is it bleeding through? 
 Uh... I don't know. 
 Wasn't it supposed to stop? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 No, I have to wrap it a little bit tighter. 
 Oh, my... oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay, here's what's gonna happen... 
 Just relax, okay? I'm gonna wrap a little bit tighter, and then if that doesn't work, uh... 
 I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it and cut the blood flow, okay? 
 No, I don't... I don't want... 
 No, no, no, it's okay. No, no. 
 I don't want you to touch it anymore. 
 I know. I know. 
 I just want you to leave it. 
 It's not gonna be long now. I promise. It's okay. 
 (Children shouting indistinctly) 
 Thank God you're here. 
 He shot Ricky. 
 This is Partytown. This isn't supposed to happen. 
 Just, uh, start at the beginning and tell us what happened. 
 Well, I was getting changed out back, you know, trying to keep the magic alive, when, uh, I saw the office door was open, and I poked my head in. 
 There was a guy digging through the desk. 
 He took the cashbox... over $4,000... 
 And then he shot Ricky. 
 I guess I surprised him. 
 I'd be surprised, big chicken coming at me. 
 Before I could say anything, he took a shot at me, I fell back, and he ran out the back door. 
 Did you see what he looked like? 
 Hard to tell. Uh, I had the chicken head on. 
 Uh, white, 30s maybe. 
 It happened pretty fast. 
 I'm used to getting kicked and I'm used to getting punched, but this one... kinda took me by surprise. 
 All right, all right, everybody follow me. 
 It's okay. We just need to close things down for a little while. 
 Keep going. All the... all right. 
 Why would somebody shoot the mascot at a kids' play land? 
 That's like shooting your Nana. 
 Your Nana dressed up in a giant chicken suit? 
 You know what? Never mind. I don't wanna know. 
 Oh, excuse me, ma'am? Are these your kids? 
 We'll need you to take them outside. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 There's been an incident. We need to clear everybody out. 
 I would love to, believe me. 
 It's my son's 6th birthday party. 
 We have 18 kids here, eating and puking and hiding and screaming. 
 This place is pretty awesome. 
 I mean... (Clears throat) You know, for kids. 
 Yeah, it's chaos. People started screaming. 
 The kids all took off. We're still missing two. 
 What are the boys' names? 
 Elliot and... Nathan. 
 Good. 
 They're little jackasses, the both of them. 
 I should never have let them come. I mean, they don't listen to anybody, not even their own mothers. It's not just me. 
 Okay, look, I'm a Dad. I-I get this. 
 All right, kids come into a place like this, and their brains turn to cotton candy, right? 
 I'm sure they're just hiding somewhere. 
 Okay. 
 And what I want you to do is take Maria out to the van and wait with the other kids. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, we will find the boys. Okay? 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Yes. Okay. Okay, pain-in-the-ass little kids aside, we gotta remember what we're doing here. 
 Okay, we've gotta talk to witnesses, take statements. 
 Okay, see if somebody saw who shot the bird man right... in the pecker. 
 There's video surveillance. 
 It's ancient, but it might have something. 
 Good. Start there. 
 See if there's cameras outside the office. 
 What about the two kids? 
 You and me, we'll fan out, okay, see if we can flush 'em loose. 
 Okay, Peck, you're gonna pull video with Epstein. 
 Uh, actually, sir, if you don't mind, I'd like to help find those boys. 
 I mean, after all, they are just children, and they are our future. 
 Okay. Whatever. Go. Go. 
 Okay. 
 Go. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 Well, it looks to me like our guy came in through the back door by the office, but Janice the manager claims that that door is permanently locked. 
 Yeah, well, I just spoke to three different people who all said that they saw a red hatchback peal out of the parking lot right after the shots were fired. 
 Getaway car. Good enough for me. Let's get a B.O.L.O. out, sweep the neighborhood, see what we see. 
 What, you think he's still in the area? 
 Well, remember, most armed robberies happen within ten blocks of the bad guy's house. 
 They hit places they know. 
 That's very stupid. 
 Or they haven't heard the expression "Don't shoot where you eat." 
 Woman : - Elliot? 
 Yoo-hoo! Children? 
 Nathan? 
 We're the police. Get your damn asses out here. 
 It's hard to believe that didn't work. 
 What's up with you and Dov? 
 What? Nothing's up. What do you mean? 
 I don't know. I mean... 
 Ever since you guys worked the gang case, you've barely spoken to each other. 
 I mean, you've been weird with each other all week. 
 Yeah, Dov's weird with everybody. It's genetic. 
 All right, fine. I'll just ask him. 
 Chris, it's... (Sighs) 
 It's fine. 
 Well, no, it's not fine. 
 You're his roommate, too. You pay rent. 
 He's not allowed to be a jerk to you. 
 Well, he's not being a jerk. He's just... 
 (Sighs deeply) He's... Don't ask him, okay? 
 He's just feeling a little stupid. It was nothing. 
 Stupid about what? 
 Stupid about taking a bunch of painkillers on the stakeout, saying a bunch of stupid things. It's not a big deal. 
 What are you talking about? 
 It was funny, all right? He said some stuff. He pledged his love. 
 It was ridiculous. His love? For  you? 
 It... it didn't mean anything. 
 (Clomping) 
 Woman : Come on, kids. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 (Static) Peck here. 
 We found one of those sticky little sweethearts. 
 Saw an old pal of yours this morning. 
 Who? 
 Donovan Boyd. 
 (Scoffs) What'd I do wrong this time? 
 He's setting up a U.C. operation... 
 Cover apartment, new identity, whole nine yards. 
 Cover apartment, huh? 
 This one is off the grid. 
 Only contact is with Boyd and the team. 
 Yeah, for how long? 
 Weeks, months, maybe longer. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 I go in three weeks. 
 W... that's it? You're not even gonna think about it? 
 Well, what is there to think about? 
 Oh! Looks like Christmas came early. 
 (Horn blares) 
 Still warm. What, you think he ran out of gas? 
 Uh, no. I just think he's your type of guy. 
 Man with a plan. 
 Oh. 
 There's only one camera out back, but it's wide-angle, so even though he parked in a corner of the lot... (Key clicks, beep) 
 We got him. 
 Hey, Epstein, that's great. Good work. 
 So can you do that thingy where you zoom in and you clean up the image? 
 You know that doesn't actually work, right? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Here. Best I can do. 
 Whitish-gray guy, medium build, with a blurry complexion. 
 (Cell phone rings) Okay. 
 (Ring, beep) 
 Sammy, Sammy. Brother, what's going on? 
 Uh, well, we found the car. 
 He ditched it over on Whitestone. 
 Glove box is empty and the plates are gone. 
 So no way to I.D him. That's smart. 
 Yeah, my guess is either he had a partner or a second car, and he made the switch. 
 Great. So we're back to zero. 
 (Key clicks, beep) Sir, you should see this. 
 Sammy, we got a bigger problem. 
 (Key clicks) 
 Shooter's got a kid with him. 
 (siren wailing) 
 His name's Elliot Walker. 6 years old. 
 He was at a birthday party at Partytown Amusements. 
 The short answer is, no, we don't have better picture. 
 We're getting one from the school database. 
 The mother for the child is on her way down here right now. 
 Elliot was taken at 14:47. That's less than an hour ago. 
 The bad news is, it's gonna get dark soon, so we gotta work fast. 
 Worse, the bad guy ditched the car, stripped the plates, the V.I.N., so we do not know who or what we're looking for yet. 
 Detective Barber is running with this. 
 Any help he needs, you give it to him. 
 Mom's here. She knows who took the kid. 
 It's my ex, Vince. It's Elliot's father. 
 He's been fighting me for custody for the last year, but he is a drug addict. 
 God, I don't want him anywhere near my son. 
 Elliot and I... We started again, you know? 
 And I have it all planned out. 
 I just need a little bit more money. 
 We're moving out east. We're going to my... 
 Any idea where he might take your son? 
 He was staying at a halfway house in the east end. Um... Sunrise? 
 He wouldn't have taken him there. No, there's no way. 
 Not even Vince is that stupid. 
 What about family? 
 All of his family's still in Collingwood, I think. 
 Okay, Tammy, does Vince have a record? 
 Assault, possession. 
 (Tammy speaking indistinctly) 
 Robbery makes sense now. 
 Yeah, parental abduction. 
 And Dad's taking off with the kid. 
 Needed cash for the trip. 
 When the Dad's got a record and he's armed, is that enough for an A.M.B.E.R. Alert? 
 You know, let me get on the horn with, uh, Collingwood P.D. and the O.P.P. to cover the freeways. 
 Yeah, I'll get our people to do spot checks on all the other routes out of the city. 
 Very good. 
 (Plastic crinkles) One chicken suit. Returned. 
 Now you know what to wear Saturday night. 
 Afraid we have to keep the head for evidence. Sign here. 
 (Telephone rings) 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 It true the same guy that shot me is the one who took the kid? 
 Looks like. 
 But it's his father, right? 
 So the kid's not in danger or anything? 
 We hope not, but he does have a history of violence. 
 And he  did  shoot you. 
 You remember that, bird boy? 
 That's the kid's mom over there? 
 Yeah, that's her. 
 She's terrified she's never gonna see her son again... 
 (Tammy speaks indistinctly) Unless we get a lead. 
 Traci... 
 This is form B11. 
 You were supposed to fill out form B14. 
 (Mouths words) B14? 
 Yeah. Right. That one is much longer. 
 I'm sorry, Ricky, but we're gonna have to ask you a few more questions... A lot more. 
 (Sam) As far as anyone's concerned, it's a standard seat belt check. 
 Wave 'em in, get an eyeball on the driver. 
 We don't know what he's driving, so we gotta check everybody. 
 All right. 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 Man : Hello. 
 Okay, go ahead. Thank you. 
 So this undercover operation with Boyd... 
 I mean, is it dangerous? 
 Well, they don't usually do deep cover on people with parking tickets... Unless you got a lot of 'em, then it's a joint meter maid/E.T.F thing, Why? You wanna come with me? 
 Just thought maybe you could use the backup. 
 Oh? I heard last time you were in deep cover, you got chased down and tackled by a girl. 
 Overeager rookie. 
 Didn't want to make her look bad on her first day. 
 Hi. 
 Woman : - What happened? 
 All right, you can go. 
 Folks, how you doing? Got your seat belt on there? Seat belt? 
 So what's Frank think about this? 
 I haven't told him yet. 
 Really are a team player. 
 What, was I supposed to check with you before I said yes? 
 You got your 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-year plan. 
 That works for you, I'm the opposite. 
 Opportunity comes along... I want it, I take it. 
 Simple as that. 
 Oh, well, congratulations on being  so  simple. 
 Thank you. 
 (Radio chatter) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Something wrong, officer? 
 Not for you. Have a good day. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa. 
 It was just supposed to be a sip. 
 It's water. Water's good for you. 
 I don't drink enough water. 
 You're not even supposed to have anything to drink. 
 You're not supposed to have liquids before surgery. 
 And how long have I... am I gonna be in the hospital for? 
 I don't know. 
 Banjo. 
 What? 
 My stupid cat. 
 If I'm gonna be in the hospital, I need someone to feed him. 
 Okay. You want me to call someone? 
 My family's all out west. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Jangling) 
 1754 Boswell. I'm in the annex. 
 There's a cupboard to the right of the fridge. 
 His food's in there. 
 Okay. 
 Careful, okay? 
 He's kind of a jerk sometimes. 
 That's okay. I'm used to those. 
 (Siren wailing) 
 I don't want to lose my job. 
 You're a giant chicken that germy kids punch for fun. 
 Believe me, the fall from grace will not be very far. 
 If you know anything about Elliot Walker being taken, you have to tell us. 
 No, I swear, I didn't know that was gonna happen. 
 But you knew  something  was gonna happen, right? 
 Look, if you tell us now, we might be able to help you. 
 Otherwise, it looks really bad for you. 
 (Sighs) This guy came in a few days ago, said his kid was gonna be at a birthday party, and his ex wouldn't let him talk to him. 
 I mean, he just wanted to talk to him for a couple of minutes. 
 He showed me a family photo, so I knew he wasn't a perv. 
 Oh, you think you can just tell everything you need to know by looking at a photo? 
 What did he need you for? 
 To leave the back door open so no one would see him coming in. 
 He... he paid me 100 bucks. 
 And then he robbed the office, he shot you... 
 Well, that's sounds like a terrific plan, Ricky. 
 We wasn't supposed to rob anything. 
 I saw a guy in the office. 
 I thought maybe someone got in 'cause I left the door unlocked. 
 Guess I surprised him. 
 But you didn't recognize him? 
 I can't see anything in that damn chicken head. 
 Besides, you guys said he took off in a red hatchback. 
 Dude who came to see me wasn't driving one of those. 
 What was he driving? 
 (Radio chatter) 
 (Oliver) Okay. 
 (Chris) Bye, sir. 
 (Dov) That was Traci. They got a lead on the car. 
 They think he's driving a maroon S.U.V. 
 All right. Okay. Well we're getting somewhere. 
 S.U.V.'s one of the most common cars on the road. 
 Don't be a buzzkill. It's a lead. 
 Now you ladies keep an eye out. 
 I'm gonna go see if I can find some bushes need watering. 
 Um... pretty sure everything's frozen this time of year. 
 I'm going pee, Diaz. 
 I'm gonna go pee in the bushes. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Radio chatter) 
 (Sniffs) 
 Do you like Gail? 
 What? 
 What happened on the stakeout? 
 What did she say? 
 Is it true? You said you're in love with her. 
 I don't know. I was totally high. 
 Did you kiss her? 
 No. 
 Yes. I... 
 Shut up, man. Don't try and talk this thing down and laugh like everything's okay. 
 I thought you two were just finally gettin' along, with the frozen drinks and the video games. 
 But it makes sense now. You were waiting for your opportunity. 
 No, Chris, I wouldn't do that to... 
 Just shut up, Dov. Just shut the hell up. 
 (Brakes squeal) 
 S.U.V., fits the description. 
 (Static) 1504, we got a maroon S.U.V. avoiding the checkpoint. 
 (Dov) He just turned down Route 9, headed in your direction. 
 Copy that. 
 Hold you position in case he doubles back. 
 We're on our way. 
 (Static) 
 We can't get more units, the fire on Lakeshore's got priority. 
 They found him. 
 Walker's S.U.V.... avoiding a checkpoint, Route 9 they're boxing him in, (siren wailing) 
 (Tires screech) 
 (Static) 
 (Sam) This is 1504. 
 We got an 11-80. Route 9, north of exit 56. 
 It's a car accident. Major damage. 
 Yeah, I know. I'll check it out. You guys stay here. 
 (Sam) 1504, shots fired. Repeat, shots fired. 
 Route 9, north of exit 56. Request immediate backup. 
 What are you guys waiting for? Let's go, let's go. 
 Woman : ...All units, 1504 has shots fired. 
 Route 9, north of exit 56. Available units, please respond. 
 (Leslie groaning) 
 Ma'am, you okay? 
 I'm okay. 
 (Sirens wailing) 
 (Tires screech, sirens stop wailing) 
 Walker's gone. 
 Clipped another car about a hundred yards back, blew his tires, and ditched it here. 
 He shot at you? 
 Cover fire when we pulled up. Gave himself a head start. 
 Best I can tell, he and the kid went thataway toward those woods. 
 That was less than ten minutes ago. They can't be far. 
 What about Andy? 
 She's down the road with a vic in the other car, keeping her stable until medics arrive. 
 (Sam) McNally, are you good? 
 Copy. Yeah, everything's under control. 
 All right, let's go. 
 (Guns unholster) 
 (Bird cries) 
 Should we call E.T.F., wait for backup? 
 We  are  backup. 
 Walker probably just wants to get away with his son, but he might be trying to punish his ex. 
 You think he could hurt the kid? 
 It happens. 
 Fresh tracks. Two sets. 
 They're, uh, they're going in different directions. 
 Maybe they got separated. Maybe. 
 All right, Diaz, Epstein, you go that way. Stay in radio contact. 
 (Chris) Yes, sir. 
 Chris... 
 Trail splits. I'm going this way. 
 Woman : 1504, rig 16 is five minutes out from your location okay, that's the fire department. 
 Okay? They're gonna get you out of here. 
 It's all right. It's gonna be okay. 
 Come on, Leslie. Just stay with me, all right? 
 Just, like, one more minute. 
 You're gonna be home soon, and I'm gonna be listening to your songs on the radio. 
 No, you won't. 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm a waiter. 
 Waitress. (Scoffs) 
 A server. Whatever you wanna call it. 
 Really, I mean... you've been writing music and recording demos. 
 Just a couple more months, right? 
 (Crying) Do you know how long I've been saying that? 
 "Not now. I just have to wait until the plan's just right." 
 Just... (Sniffles) 
 "Just a couple more songs. Just a couple more tracks." 
 That bottle of champagne I told you about? 
 I bought it six years ago. 
 (Cries) 
 I mean, what the hell am I saving it for? 
 Later. 
 You'll drink it later. 
 (Sighs) Right. 
 Um, no liquids before surgery, right? 
 Come on, stay awake. Okay? 
 There's no way Walker's getting very far without a vehicle. 
 Another 2 or 3 miles, these woods meet the highway. 
 He could carjack somebody. He's already shot one person today. 
 (Birds chirping, , helicopter approaching) 
 Epstein. I think I found something. 
 (Sam) 10-4. We'll be right there. Epstein, what's your 20? 
 (Static crackles) 
 You should've left me alone. 
 Epstein, what's your 20? 
 (Static) 
 You don't want to do this. 
 Don't move, Walker! 
 This is not gonna go your way. 
 Put it down! Put the gun down now! 
 Put the gun down. 
 This is Diaz. We found Walker. We have a 10-33. 
 Shut up! Put the gun down! 
 He can't do that, not as long as you're pointing your gun at me. 
 I just wanna be with my son, okay? I love him. 
 I just want some time alone with him, just the two of us. 
 I'm only gonna ask you one more time. 
 Put the gun down, or I will shoot you! 
 (Oliver) Walker, it's over, all right? Just put it down. 
 Walker! We found Elliot! 
 Daddy! I wanna go home! 
 Elliot? Are you okay, buddy? 
 He's fine. He just didn't wanna play the game anymore. 
 (Radio chatter) Vincent, do your son a favor and show him you know how to do the right thing. 
 (Oliver) Put the gun down now and get on your knees! 
 Slowly. 
 Slowly. 
 (Radio chatter continues) 
 (Chris) Down. Down. Give me your hand. 
 Elliot, I'm sorry! Okay, buddy? Daddy loves you! 
 (Handcuffs clicking) (Oliver) You're good. Let's get this kid into the warm. 
 (Engine crackling, hissing, and popping) 
 Why does it smell like a campfire in here? 
 (Leslie coughing) 
 (Trunk creaks) 
 (Clattering) 
 (Metal clinking) 
 We can't wait anymore. I gotta get you out of here. 
 I'm gonna get this underneath you, okay? 
 So we can make enough room so you can pull yourself out of there. 
 Leslie, I'm gonna need your help. 
 (More crackling) 
 Just hold on. 
 Hold on. 
 (Coughing) I can't breathe. I can't breathe. 
 It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Okay, Leslie. 
 (Andy panting) All right. Okay. 
 When I say go," you have to pull yourself up no matter how much it hurts, okay? 
 All right. Okay. 
 (Clanking) 
 (Leslie coughing) 
 Hold on! 
 Aah! Okay? All right, go! 
 Go! Go, go, go! 
 (Gasps) 
 (Panting) Okay. Come on. Come on. Ready? (Grunts) 
 Just grab... grab... 
 Aah! (Groaning) 
 (Gasps) Aah! 
 Aah! 
 (Panting) 
 All right. Okay? 
 (Groaning) Okay. Okay. 
 (Panting) 
 Like I said... 
 No problem. 
 (Extinguishers hissing) 
 (Sam) - Shaw. 
 What? 
 Take Elliot. 
 All right, come here, Elliot. 
 Go on. 
 (Oliver) Hi, Elliot. This is my friend Casey. 
 (Radio chatter) 
 Andy?! 
 Andy? 
 Sam! 
 I'm okay. 
 I got her out, like, just before it went up. 
 If I had known the car was gonna catch on fire... 
 Hey, it's okay. 
 Even the medic said she's gonna be fine. 
 You should've radioed. 
 You were miles out. And, you know, car was on fire. 
 I had that whole thing to deal with. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Did you get the boy? 
 They found him, yeah. 
 Good. 
 (Radio chatter continues) 
 Pretty intense out there, huh? 
 (Metallic clank) 
 Just glad it worked out. 
 (Radio chatter) 
 (Locker door clanks) 
 Chris... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, I don't want to talk right now. 
 And I'm not gonna say everything's okay just cause you almost died... Again. 
 So it's that last button right there, Elliot. 
 (Click) And look. 
 Isn't that cool? Watch this. 
 (Siren whooping) (Laughs) Okay. Is that amazing? 
 Now if you wanted it to... Oh, here we go, little man. 
 (Gaps) Hey, baby! 
 Mommy! 
 Hi, sweetheart! Come here! Cone here! 
 Hi, baby! Hi, baby! Oh! 
 Ohh! (Sniffles) 
 (Kisses) You okay? 
 (Elliot) Yeah, I'm okay. 
 You're okay. You wanna go home, baby? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah? Let's go home, buddy. Oh! 
 (Jerry) All right, let's get you home. 
 Chris, wait up! 
 What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? You kissed my best friend. 
 Whoa, Chris, it was not even like that. 
 What... you know what? Save it. 
 'Cause I don't care how high Dov was, I know you, Gail, and I know there is no way you would let anyone get close enough to do anything unless you wanted them to. I gotta go. 
 (Sighs deeply) 
 (Zips up bag) McNally. 
 Hey. How's it goin'? Hell of a day, huh? 
 Hey, the hospital called. They need your notes for the postmortem on the woman in the car. 
 What? 
 Atkins? Leslie Atkins. 
 Yeah. Leslie's alive. 
 Seriously, she's fine. I got her out in time. 
 The medic said she'd be fine. 
 She passed about 20 minutes ago. 
 She had an embolism. Got into her bloodstream on impact. 
 Hit her lungs, and that was it. 
 I got her out. 
 I mean, she... She was fine. 
 Uh... 
 Hey, I'm sure that you did everything you could. 
 You couldn't have known. It happens sometimes. 
 You do what you can, and it looks like you got 'em, and... then you don't. 
 (Whispers) Yeah. 
 (Normal voice) Um... 
 Yeah. 
 I... can you tell Traci I'll catch up with her later? 
 I... w-where you going? 
 (Door squeaks) 
 I gotta go feed a jerky cat. 
 (Door creaks) 
 (Cat meows) 
 Aw. Somebody's hungry. 
 (Continues meowing) 
 (Lock turns)

 Hi. Come here.
