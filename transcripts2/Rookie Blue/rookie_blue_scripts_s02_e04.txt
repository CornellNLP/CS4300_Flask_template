 Okay, maybe this is a really bad idea. 
 Okay, let me... Come on take my arm and let me help you. 
 Okay, just admit it... 
 I make a sexy nurse, umm? 
 I can do this. Please. 
 Okay, then why don't we just go back in there? 
 We can lie down, and... I'll give you a massage. 
 Okay, I also make a very sexy R.M.T. 
 I can't be in that room anymore, all right? 
 It's like I can't breathe in there. 
 The windows don't open, I'm surrounded by balloons and flowers. I mean... 
 Oh no. 
 Seriously, do I look like a tulip guy to you? 
 Luke? What do you want? Anything. 
 What is gonna make you happy? 
 I want to go back to work, I want to have not been shot by my own gun, and I want to walk down the hallway without using my fiancee as a Walker. 
 You do make a real sexy Walker, though. 
 Okay. I'll tell you what. 
 Let's go to the cafeteria, and I'll get us a scrabble board. 
 Honey, you're terrible at scrabble. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Race ya. 
 Rookie Blue Season 02 Episode 04 
Heart And Sparks 
Original Air Date:  July 14, 2011 
 I thought kids didn't exercise these days! 
 Man down! 
 Hold still. 
 You're hurting my head! 
 That's so you don't bang it, accuse me of police brutality, you little creep. 
 Stop! 
 All right.Put the pillowcase down. Get down on the ground, hands on your head. 
 Dov! 
 Got him. 
 Yeah, he got him. 
 Down now. 
 He's got him. 
 This is Epstein... 
 Yes, he does. 
 All hail the conquering heroes. 
 Can I not? 
 Broke up a dogfighting ring in Little Portugal. 
 Bunch of guys stealing house pets, using them as bait, giving them a taste of blood. 
 You... you personally broke it up? 
 Well... We were there. We were near. 
 No. 
 Just... no, just... 
 No. Chris, we can't keep that. 
 No, yeah, look look, we just we're just gonna keep him till we find his parents, okay? We're like his, uh... 
 We're like his foster parents. 
 We're already Dov's foster parents. 
 Bite me, Casper. 
 You know what, Chris? 
 You decide who you want licking your feet tonight. How about that? 
 It's like "Sophie's Choice"... only different. 
 I love this little fellow already. 
 We'll talk later. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't worry, little buddy. Her bark's worse than her bite. 
 You know, sometimes...I don't get that guy. 
 One of life's great mysteries. 
 Time for a little "Death Domain"? 
 Want to play till he gets back? 
 Are you ready to be humiliated? 
 Game on. 
 b*st*rd. 
 Bye, you. 
 Bye, mommy. 
 You gonna be working late again tonight? 
 I'll try and be home by dinner. I know you got hockey. 
 Don't worry. I already told 'em that I couldn't make it. 
 It's fine. Just get home when you can. 
 Serious, it's cool. 
 Thank you. 
 I can do it. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. Thank you. 
 Hey. 
 Hi there. 
 I didn't know you'd been working late. 
 Yeah, I have, a few times. 
 'Cause I've been working late every night for the past two weeks, and I don't remember seeing you. 
 You've been working late every night the past two weeks? 
 Don't change the subject. 
 I don't know what to do about Luke. I mean, I've tried everything... action movies, crosswords, sudoku. I've even offered to play poker. 
 What is gonna cheer him up? Don't say p0rn. 
 I would have thought the poker. Maybe a little p0rn. 
 Shut up. 
 Guy's all hopped up on painkillers. Give him a break. 
 I know. I mean, I know the doctor said that he could be down after the surgery, but I am doing everything wrong. I'm saying all the wrong things. 
 Well, give him some space. 
 I don't like space, because space doesn't involve me doing something. 
 You know, it's kind of like time. 
 Time doesn't work for me either. 
 Time and space... two things that don't work for you. 
 Pretty much. 
 Dale from next door is taking the dog out this afternoon. 
 You better watch yourself with the dog, man. You heard what Gail said. 
 She just being mean. 
 You don't dump the pooch, Shorty might dump you. 
 So what? You hate having Gail around anyways. 
 You're right. I do hate having Gail around. 
 So what do you care if she dumps me? 
 Tell him. 
 Because... Gail's awesome. 
 Little side bet last night, right before I crushed your friend here. 
 It was a total fluke.I had a bad game. 
 Yeah, right. 
 What? 
 I had a bad game. 
 So Epstein's got to spend the entire day admitting that... 
 Gail's awesome. 
 Yes. 
 So you two actually had fun together? 
 All right. Listen up. Another garage fire last night, north edge of 15 Division. 
 Detective. 
 That's four this month, two in the last week. 
 So keep an eye open. 
 If there's one thing we know about firebugs, it's that they love to watch their target burn. 
 Kind of like me watching you burn last night. 
 What a rush. 
 Peck! 
 Yeah. 
 Care to share? 
 No, we're good. 
 Detective Barber. 
 Officer Nash. 
 What are you doing? 
 Well, Oliver keeps coming up behind me, grabbing my gun out of my holster, and saying... 
 "What if I was a suspect? You'd be dead by now." 
 So I'm just trying to practice somebody stealing my gun. 
 Let me see your interview stance. 
 Yeah. There's your problem. 
 Drop your elbows. 
 Tuck 'em in. 
 Okay. 
 You got to feel your gun at all times. 
 What are you doing later? 
 Why? You gonna text me for a hook up? 
 Already have. 
 Really? 
 Couple of "L.O.L.s," a few "O.M.G.s"? 
 Little bit. 
 Where the hell's my phone? 
 Hey Nash. Hot call. And by hot," I mean there's a laundromat on fire at Aldermere Mall. 
 Arson? 
 I don't know, do I? Because I'm not a mentalist. 
 Let's go. 
 Start with the other store owners. We need statements. 
 If this is our guy, good chance he's somewhere around here, watching. 
 The place was self-serve, so it was empty at the time. That's the good news. 
 We're gonna track down the owner with the alarm company. 
 In the meantime, we need names. 
 Find out who saw what, and report back... 
 Burnt my pants. 
 Yeah. 
 Peck. 
 I would talk to him, but, um, you know, since I... what is the word? 
 Humiliated  Officer Epstein in Death Domain last night... 
 I can respect that. 
 Epstein, all yours. 
 Peck, you're awesome. 
 Excuse me, sir? Can I talk to you for a second? 
 You can't go in there yet. It's very unstatabl so... 
 What a mess. 
 Kind of wish it had burnt to the ground. 
 Why? Easier investigation? 
 No, we just wouldn't have to spend all day with the hose monkeys. 
 A guy's insecure enough... other guys... without having to watch last year's charity calendar work it out for the ladies. 
 Shaw, come on. 
 Every girl knows it's what's inside the counts. 
 Man, that's feeble, McNally. 
 Weak. For that you get guard duty on the door. 
 Seriously? 
 What? 
 Okay. 
 This is pretty cool, huh? 
 Looks like the same guy. Looks like we might have a shot. 
 All right. I don't love fire, okay? 
 Nobody likes fire, Noelle. 
 No. I'm serious. 
 I spent my entire childhood worrying about fire. 
 Are... are we gonna go out this window? That window? Climb down that tree? 
 I kept bugging my mom, you know? I had at least eight exit strategies. 
 And what'd your mom say? 
 She gave me a plan, a little map. 
 Plan "A", plan "B", plan "C". 
 Pretty good strategy. 
 Yeah, she was a pretty good mom. 
 Yeah, the place was already in flames when I smelled the smoke, so I called 9-1-1 right away. 
 Yeah. Do you know the person who owns the building? 
 I've seen him around. Don't know his name, though. Sorry. 
 Wish I could help you out more. 
 All right, let's go. Come on. 
 I had a whole cycle to wait, felt like a latte. 
 I got back, place was locked up. 
 Looking round, trying to figure out how to get in and get my pants, when, "boom!" 
 Yeah? Anybody else watching? 
 That girl there. 
 Excuse me. You mind if I ask you a few questions about the fire? 
 Can't.I got to go. I'm sorry. 
 It's not gonna take long. I just need your name. 
 I'm actually not asking you You are so busted. 
 You're not allowed to interrogate me. 
 We are not interrogating you. 
 We're just asking for your name and address. 
 Yeah. Go ahead. Keep asking me questions. 
 Trust me, I know my rights. 
 My Dad's an excellent lawyer. 
 See, this is when I'm glad I don't have kids. 
 I only need one of you guys to stay. 
 Finders, keepers. 
 It's not that particular dog. lt's all dogs. 
 They have perpetual puke breath, and they just love you unconditionally. 
 Only gonna keep him for a couple of days. 
 Yeah, what if you don't find the owner? 
 Hello? 
 Here. 
 Excuse me? Sir. 
 Do you mind putting that down for a moment? 
 Jeez. 
 Scared me. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yeah, we need to ask you a few questions about the fire. 
 Ryan? 
 Yeah, Ryan Miller. 
 Do I know you? 
 Chris. 
 Chris? Chris Diaz? 
 It's good to see you, man. 
 How you doing? 
 I mean, look at you. You look like a cop. 'Cause you are a cop. 
 Chris Diaz. You know, God... He used to play cops. 
 I never thought you'd grow up to be one. 
 How's your mom doing? 
 Good, thanks. 
 So you saw the fire? 
 No, I got here after it was out. 
 Yeah. 
 You got anyone who can verify that? 
 Yeah, sure, my wife. 
 You're married. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you know the guy who owns the laundromat? 
 Yeah. His name's, um, Ron Hannah. 
 I'll let officer Shaw know. 
 Okay, you don't go anywhere. We still need to get your statement. 
 Who's her Dad? 
 "Donald Sharpe, of Sharpe & McCarthy Sullivan." 
 Great, terrific, best in town. 
 We sure she's guilty? 
 Well, four garage fires and now the laundromat, all within 2 Miles of her school, plus the arson for dummies kit in her knapsack. 
 You coming? 
 We're not allowed to interrogate her. 
 So you'll sit there and be my witness as I don't interrogate her. 
 Detective Barber? 
 Yes, Officer Nash. 
 I'm still kind of new here, right out of the academy. 
 Well, let me tell you, we are all thrilled with your performance so far. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 But I'm confused. When a young offender commits a crime like, I don't know, arson, is the punishment community service or juvie? 
 That's a good question. 
 It all depends, Officer Nash, on whether the young offender is friendly, cooperative... not threatening to get their daddy in here and make my life a living hell. 
 Detective Barber to reception, please. 
 Speaking of. 
 That's great, Kevin. Thanks. Tell you what, why don't you put Finlay on it? Thanks. 
 Detective. Donald sharpe, Esther's Dad. 
 Jerry Barber. So we got her in interview. 
 Well, that's good. Good, good. 
 Must be some massive mix-up. 
 You didn't, uh, take her statement yet, did you? 
 No, no. No. 'Course not. Waiting for you. 
 That's good. That's great. 
 Must be some reasonable explanation. 
 Got to take this. Sec. Yeah. 
 Michael. 
 Hey, that's great. 
 Tell you what, can I call you back in five? 
 Of course we're still on for tonight. 
 We're all good. 
 All right, how do you spell "Hannah"? 
 Couple of h's, a's, n's, I don't know. 
 Okay. I'm gonna go call this in. 
 Chris. So that that guy knew your mom? 
 That's the last guy I ever thought I'd have to deal with. 
 I mean... A city this big... 
 So what? They used to date? 
 Yeah, for a few years. Guy took off when I was 10. 
 He was your stepfather? 
 Are we done here? 
 We still need to get a statement. 
 Yeah. Go for it. I got nothing to say to that clown. 
 Clown... What? 
 Ma'am? Ma'am.Ma'am! No, no, no. You can't go in there. 
 My husband... he's in there! 
 Nobody's in there, okay? No, the door was locked. 
 That his car! 
 Okay, just... hold on a second, okay? Stay here. 
 Neil. 
 Ma'am! Ma'am, you can't go in there. lt's dangerous. 
 Ma'am! The roof is unstable! The building is about to collapse! 
 Ma'am! The building's unsafe! Stop! 
 I just said the building's not safe! 
 McNally...Copy, McNally?! 
 Yeah, we're here, we're here. 
 We're okay, but I think we're stuck in here. 
 No, you've got to stay still, you got to stay still... what... whoa! 
 You know what? You guys stay right there. 
 You're not going in there. Anybody barges in, the roof could come down, okay? 
 Fire's called for a backup. 
 What the hell were you thinking, letting her go in there in the first place?! 
 Obviously, I didn't let her. 
 So what? She's in there with the body? 
 Yeah, and the body's wife. Sam, she's fine. 
 McNally, how you doing in there? 
 Yeah, we're okay, it's just... trying to keep things calm. 
 Copy. 
 How did this ever happen? 
 You know what? We already have a suspect in custody. 
 Ron. Ron, I'm so sorry. 
 Mrs. Hannah, please. 
 Lidia. 
 Lidia, please. We have to keep the evidence clean.Okay? 
 No, no, no. You just have to stay away from the body just for a little bit you shouldn't even be seeing him like this. 
 I have to get him out of here. 
 I know, I completely agree with you, but right now we need to stay calm. 
 Okay? It's very important to stay calm. 
 Okay. 
 What's McNally's cell number? 
 No, I want to speak to her privately. I don't want the wife listening. 
 Look, it's a crime scene. 
 If I can't be in there, I want to know what she's seeing, at least. 
 It's too dangerous for the fire department in there, but you're gonna have her rooting around? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, you're not thinking clearly. 
 We have a suspect in custody, whose father's a hotshot lawyer. 
 If this place collapses, we need to know everything we can before it... 
 If you've trained her well, she's gonna be champing at the bit to do her job. 
 Speed-dial three. 
 Who are number one and number two? 
 Officer...Nash. How's my girl? 
 Daddy I'm sure I don't have to tell you, but anything she may have said to you is inadmissible. 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Obtained without permission. 
 Kevin. 
 That's great. 
 Thank you, my friend. 
 Yeah, no, no, no, I'm I'm at the station already. 
 You're a good man. 
 Her lawyer is on his way. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. 
 Maddie. No... hey. 
 I'll be ten minutes late. 
 Yeah. 
 It's a minor delay. 
 
 
 
 I did it. 
 What? 
 She didn't mean that. 
 Don't be stupid, honey. 
 Not you. 
 Put toilet paper in the windows and lit it. 
 The curtains caught first, then everything went up. 
 I'll call you back. 
 This is not admissible. 
 This is privileged. 
 You know what the best part is? 
 When the windows blow out. Boom. 
 Esther, shut it. Now. 
 Okay. 
 There was a body in that fire, so your daughter just confessed to a homicide. 
 Now look... Give me a second. 
 Can you see it? 
 Yeah. 
 You're looking for eschar. 
 For what? 
 Eschar, a blackened skin around the throat, like a ring or a necklace. 
 The skin gets constricted when it burns, makes it impossible to breathe. 
 Okay, I... Honestly, I can't make anything out that, uh, that distinctive. 
 Then look around his mouth, his nose. Do you see any lines of soot? 
 Yeah, but I really... I can't... I can't tell. 
 All right. 
 We'll get you out of there soon. 
 Okay. 
 So we can't confirm anything. 
 We don't know whether Ron Hannah died in the fire, or he was already dead when it started. 
 Sorry.Did you want to speak to her? 
 Can I have my phone back? 
 Yeah. 
 McNally, one more thing. 
 While you're in there, find out what the wife knows about Esther Sharpe. 
 Okay. 
 Does the name Esther Sharpe mean anything to you? 
 No. Who is she? Maybe she's customer. Why are you asking? 
 No, we're just trying to figure out who might be responsible for this. 
 I am responsible. 
 What? 
 It's my fault he was here, opening earlier, staying later, all to make us more money. 
 Every morning, I get up early to make him breakfast, but this morning, my alarm didn't go off. 
 He was already gone. He must have left so early. 
 It's okay. 
 I can't breathe. I can't be in here with him like this. 
 No, Lidia, Lidia, stop... 
 I need to get out. 
 No. You can't. 
 Just hold on. 
 Sam, are you there? 
 Right here. 
 Listen, how much longer? 
 They're working as fast as they can, you know? 
 Okay. Well, Mrs. Hannah is... very uncomfortable. 
 We're both uncomfortable in here. 
 I hear you.Just don't move around and don't let her touch anything, okay? 
 Yeah, I know that, but it's really hard. 
 Okay, I'm gonna put the phone down for a second. 
 I'm here if you need me, okay? 
 Lidia? Lidia? 
 Yeah. 
 They're on their way right now, okay? So I just I just want you to talk to me. 
 Talk about your husband. 
 I don't want to talk. I want out. 
 Okay. Tell me how you met Ron. 
 Internet. 
 Okay. Dating web site? 
 It was web site, yes, where... 
 European women meet men from North America. 
 Okay. 
 And then a woman I work with... she is older and not as pretty, and yet she moved to New York. 
 New York. So I come here. 
 Okay, and you met Ron. 
 I think, if I don't like him, I'll leave, but he is nice... 
 Lonely. He hadn't met the right person until me. 
 How much longer? 
 You know what? Just a few more minutes. 
 You're doing great. You can do this, okay? Just keep talking. 
 You are distracting me. You are very good police. 
 Everybody loves a fire guy, hey, brother? 
 Never have to make an arrest. All you have to do is pour water on things. 
 They're gonna get her out of there. 
 Sam, these guys know what they're doing. 
 I know. 
 Good. 
 And once she's out, might be a good time to talk to her. 
 About what? 
 About...I don't know. 
 Whatever. 
 Okay. You know what? We're gonna hear sirens in a few seconds. 
 Okay? So, um, how about, uh, the business? 
 Was the business not going well? I mean, what happened? 
 We could never get ahead. 
 I told him I didn't care, but it was keeping him up at night... the worry. 
 He promised me certain kind of life. 
 I don't hear trucks. I don't hear anything. 
 Life... life and marriage, you know, sometimes, you know well, most of the time it doesn't work out how you promise, you know? But love... 
 When you love each other, that's what matters. 
 I loved him! He never knew! I never told him! 
 No, no, no, no. He knew. Lidia? He knew. You know why? 
 Because you made him breakfast every morning. 
 You hear that? Okay. Okay. Okay, just breathe. We're gonna be fine. 
 Hold on to me, and just breathe. That's it. 
 Let's make it work, guys. Yeah. 
 In there. 
 I've got her on the phone right now. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Sam! 
 Follow me, walk where I walk, and keep your head up. 
 We're gonna use the saw. Tell 'em to stay back, get under something solid. 
 Andy? Andy, you there? 
 Sam, yeah, yeah, I'm here. 
 They're gonna cut through, all right? 
 You guys got to find some solid cover, stay back. 
 We got to go under the desk. 
 I can't. 
 I know. 
 Look, we can't. We ha... we can't go anywhere else. 
 Okay? This is the only place that's stable in here. 
 We've got to go under there. Okay? You can do it. 
 Oh, God. 
 I got here around 9:45. 
 I didn't even know there was a fire until I saw the trucks. 
 Chris, Andy and the wife are okay. They got them both out. 
 We should probably call Luke about Andy. 
 You know, I think he'd probably want to know. 
 Yeah, she'll call him when she's done with Jo. 
 Chris, we really should go back and finish taking Ryan's statement. 
 What part of, "I've got nothing to say to that clown," didn't you understand? 
 The clown" part. 
 Look, I don't want to talk to him. All right? 
 My mom gave everything to that guy. Okay? 
 She was a... she was a complete basket case, and he made her that way. 
 And when he finally left... 
 She lost it. 
 I mean, it was... 
 It was... it was bad. 
 Look, he... he didn't have time for us then, so I don't have time for him now. 
 Okay, okay. 
 You stay here. I'll get a statement. 
 So Ron Hannah's broke. He feels really guilty. He's in terrible debt. 
 So you think he set the fire for the insurance money? 
 You're a romantic, huh? 
 I just think he probably read the papers. 
 You know, sees that there's a bunch of fires in the area and decides he'll copycat. 
 Okay. So he sets the fire. Fine. How's he get stuck in his office? 
 I don't know. I mean, maybe it went up faster than he thought it would. 
 McNally's got pretty good instincts. 
 Is that right? 
 While you were in there, the girl confessed... all four garages and this one this morning. 
 O-okay. Well... I'll just go get cleaned up, then. 
 Well, she was in there with the wife. You were not. 
 Yeah, okay. I'll check out her hunch. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't talk much to Hannah, but he seemed friendly with the rental car guy. 
 He spent most of his day in the parking lot, drinking coffee with him. 
 Okay. So I'm gonna need you to sign the statement, once we have it typed. 
 Chris Diaz... I'm his girlfriend, and... 
 You should know that he turned out amazing. 
 That's good. 
 I'm glad. 
 Kid had it pretty rough. 
 Yeah, I'm sure you leaving didn't help things. 
 I take it you never met Tina? Chris's mom? 
 She was always on that kid. 
 She had all these crazy rules. 
 He tried to make himself dinner once, and he stood on a chair to get some spaghetti out of the cupboard, and he spilled the whole box. 
 Tina made him stand on that chair for three hours. 
 A little kid, white as a sheet, and his knees were buckling... 
 The day I called child services was the day she kicked me out. 
 Your Dad always that busy? 
 God. Makes me feel like the best mother in the world. 
 My kid still gets mad at me, though. 
 When I work late nights, hides my keys, pretends he's got a sore throat. 
 It works about half the time. 
 But it's a fine line. 
 Got to be careful how much you want to sacrifice just to get a bit of attention. 
 Did somebody, uh, actually die in that fire? 
 Man named Ron Hannah. 
 He was the owner. He was married. 
 I didn't do it. 
 So why were you there? 
 My school's two blocks away. I saw the fire, and I got off the bus. 
 And what about all that stuff in your backpack? 
 I was gonna torch the utility shed after fifth period. 
 You get anything off that welding guy? 
 Yeah. I did. 
 Okay, what's going on? 
 Are you so awesome that you convinced Chris to get rid of that puppy? 
 You know, there's a really big difference between us and Chris. 
 Not sure I like being lumped into the Gail camp, but...  proceed. 
 He's used to looking after things, and we're used to being looked after. 
 If he wants the dog, he can keep it. 
 Okay, what just happened? 
 Okay. So the kid didn't light the fire. 
 I'm sure Detective Rosati will follow up on what you said. 
 Yeah, what if she doesn't, huh? 
 Besides, they're always telling us to do more proactive policing anyway. 
 Yeah, but... 
 There. 
 Cover me. 
 Yeah. 
 Not that I'm a party to this clear violation of the rules, but, uh... 
 How can we help? 
 You talk to Ryan? 
 Yeah. 
 What'd he say? 
 Nothing much. 
 Okay. Move over. Cover me. 
 Okay, what is going on here? 
 I'm just smelling for gas. lf Ron Hannah started the fire, maybe he brought a can of it to work. 
 Yeah, unless he didn't start it. 
 Well, then who? 
 Bet that rental car company's got gas. 
 What's his name? 
 Nappo. Joey Nappo. 
 Mr. Nappo. Andy McNally, 15 Division. 
 I already talked to the police. 
 Yeah. 
 You said you didn't know the guy who owned the laundromat. 
 Yeah, but according to the other tenants, you guys were afternoon coffee buddies. 
 Not anymore. 
 Is that Ron? 
 I just spoke to his wife, Lidia. You know her? 
 That's all he ever talked about. 
 She's the reason he asked me. 
 How much he offer you? 
 $10,000. 
 He wasn't supposed to be in there. 
 He was gonna go home. 
 He was gonna lock up and tape a note on the door saying, "Back in five"... 
 This whole thing was to help him start a new life. 
 How's it going with little Miss Firestarter? 
 Her Dad took her home, she's got an order to appear in the morning, so I guess we'll see what happens. 
 Probably nothing, with a father like that. 
 Where is my phone? 
 You're not working late tonight? 
 No way. What I need is a hot bath, not more overtime. 
 Yeah, two weeks straight of O.T. must be a little burnt out. 
 $10,000 that's how much one round of in vitro costs. 
 I'm killing myself just trying to get pregnant. 
 So you should take a little time off. 
 I can't. 
 I mean, one, I can't afford it, and two, when a woman takes time off in this job, everybody starts talking. 
 She's either having a nervous breakdown, or she's having a baby. 
 I don't know which is worse. 
 You should talk to Frank. 
 I don't think so. 
 I'm serious. He's discreet. He'll run a smoke screen for you, You know, tell everyone you're studying for the sergeants' exam or something. 
 You're good at this. 
 Don't change the subject. 
 Congrats on the confession. 
 I can't believe it. 
 I pour my heart out to you in eloquent text messages, and you lose your phone? 
 I didn't lose it. I can't find it. 
 Traci, I'm miserable. 
 We talked about this. 
 I know, I know. I get it. 
 You're tough, beautiful, sexy, and ambitious, and you're throwing away your happiness 'cause you think it's gonna make you better at work. 
 Here's the thing. 
 I'm telling you firsthand, from personal experience Jerry. 
 You. You're Jerry? 
 What are you doing here? 
 "Tuesday still lingers," Dex. 
 All right. 
 Just take this. 
 Here's the thing. 
 No, no... lt's good. It's good. 
 Dex... 
 Are you okay? 
 Show's over. 
 You got a minute? 
 Yeah, yeah. Come on in. 
 The... the minute's not now. 
 The minute is really later, tomorrow, next week, even. 
 Can we book an appointment or something? 
 Is this about a fire? 
 No. 
 No, it... it's more personal, kind of, but not in a big deal" kind of way, just... 
 Okay, how about Friday? That new Italian place on King? Say, 7:00-ish. 
 W... that's not... w... uh, uh, sure. Sure, that... that'd be nice. 
 Okay. So I'll... I'll see you then. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Ident found a plastic pill bottle melted in Ron Hannah's pocket. 
 Still waiting on the results from toxicology. 
 Okay. 
 Well, the guy was probably unconscious by the time Joey Nappo set the fire. 
 Suicide. 
 Yeah, looks like, uh, he wanted his wife to have the life insurance money, too. 
 So what, you love something, you set it free? 
 Not me. Me, I like to keep the things I love close. 
 Hold 'em in a death grip, never let 'em go. 
 Who does that? 
 What kind of person actually... 
 What? 
 Okay, so... so Ron Hannah starts talking details about torching the place, right? 
 And... and Joey just says,"Sure, yeah, no problem, buddy. 
 Give me 10k, and I'll light the fuse for you. 
 Well, it's illegal, but he didn't know Ron was gonna kill himself. 
 Yeah, but if the guy's your friend, you'd think that he'd give him some time to think it over. 
 I mean, you don't have to light the fricking match. 
 Time and space, McNally. You said it yourself. None of us are experts. 
 Except you. Time and space, and you're a bona fide savant. 
 I'm there when it matters. 
 Sam. 
 What? You need a ride? 
 No. No, I don't.Thank you. 
 Okey-doke. 
 Thai, sushi, or Chinese? 
 Whatever. You pick. 
 Chris is gonna want pizza again. 
 Have you ever met Chris's mother? 
 No. Why? 
 I'm thinking she might have been a little out there. 
 And maybe that's why... 
 Chris is with me, because I'm nuts just like his mother. 
 No, Gail. You're not nuts. You're... 
 Don't. 
 No. I mean it. You're awesome. 
 Really. 
 Dov. 
 What are you guys talking about? 
 The dog. We should keep it. 
 Yeah, we, uh, found the owner today. 4-year-old kid in Riverdale. 
 You okay? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Remember when, that guy bit me, and they made me see a shrink? 
 Come on. It's time you stopped feeling sorry for yourself. 
 You know, what I love about you is your sympathetic nature? 
 You didn't die. 
 Florence Nightingale over here. 
 Yeah, get... get rid of those, too, please. 
 Seriously, though, this is great. I feel like I can breathe in here again.
