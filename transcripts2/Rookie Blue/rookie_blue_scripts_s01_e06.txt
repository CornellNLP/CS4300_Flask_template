 (Traci) You know, maybe we could get him for jaywalking. 
 I mean, he just... he ran right through traffic. 
 Too obvious. 
 Loitering? Those little shorts... he's probably not got any I.D. on him. 
 Oh, now see, there you go. That's... that's public indecency. 
 That's a criminal code violation. 
 We're gonna have to search him. 
 Well... 
 I gotta tell you, Nash, When it comes to men, putting on this uniform is like putting on an invisibility cloak. 
 ♪ come on and get the minimum ♪ 
 Help me! Help me, please! Stop him! 
 1525. 1525. Sounds of gunshot, possible injured party. 
 Black S.U.V. headed west on Scadding. 
 Start an ambulance! 
 ♪ collected at the borderline ♪ 
 My baby's in the back! They've got my baby! 
 (Traci) Police! Don't move! 
 Drop your gun! 
 (Noelle) Nash, don't shoot! There's a baby in the vehicle! 
 There is a baby in the vehicle! 
 Police! Don't move! On your knees! On your knees!

♪ in your new life ♪

 Oh, my God! 
 Is she okay? Thank you.

 Yesterday, Officer Williams, Officer Nash, apprehended this man, Jayson Kraker... carjacker who almost got away with that baby yesterday. 
 Good job. (Officers cheering) 
 (Frank) Okay, now Kraker... he's also our prime suspect in last week's murder of the tourists in that parking garage. 
 Homicide's working on that. 
 Now we got Kraker's gun. 
 The only problem is we can't find the bullet to link him to the murder. 
 And Kraker's accomplice is still at large. 
 Most likely armed, definitely dangerous. 
 You know the drill. 
 That's it. You have your assignments. 
 Congratulations, Officer Nash. 
 Yeah, it's too bad the other guy got away. 
 Why are we all being held back doing our regular assignments? 
 I mean, we should be out there looking for that other carjacker if he's so dangerous, right? 
 You mean, like the time I busted up that international gun smuggling operation? 
 Follow my lead. 
 (Chuckles) Will do, Officer Epstein. (Chuckles) 
 (Gail) Will do. 
 Come on. 
 I'm working on it. I'm working on it. 
 All right. Gimme... gimme that. Gimme. 
 Ah, Detective Barber. 
 Wow, look at that face, that baby face. 
 I finally feel like I'm seeing the real you. 
 Okay, shut up, and I'm never playing poker with you clowns again. 
 Just bring more money next time so we don't have to bet your facial hair. 
 Whoa, you look great. 
 Really? 
 Come on, choirboy. Time to roll. 
 All right. You ready to catalogue some evidence? 
 Yeah. I guess searching stolen cars is my reward for being such a hero. 
 Wanna trade? 
 No. 
 No talking. You're driving. 
 Save me. 
 Hey, Sammy. 
 Yeah? 
 Win big last night? 
 Yeah. 
 Feeling generous? 
 No. 
 How about you give me McNally for the day? 
 What, are you detailing my, uh, rookie to homicide? 
 Bosses want more bodies on the carjackers. 
 Mayor's coming down hard, too many headlines. 
 Bad for tourism. 
 Serve, protect, keep the mayor happy. 
 At least you got Kraker in custody. 
 Yeah, now all I have to do is prove he did it. 
 What do you say? 
 Yeah, fine. She's all yours. 
 Really, seriously? 
 Yeah. Have fun. 
 Last poker game, Jerry took Sam for over $400. 
 It looks like revenge was sweet. 
 Do you play with them? 
 No, that table's too easy. 
 Plus, I'm a great bluffer. 
 Wait. Did you really need an extra body on this case? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, you're not just choosing me because... you know. 
 No. 
 Swear. 
 That's a sign of bluffing. 
 Andy... 
 I'm just checking. 
 (Chris) 1507. Check. 
 Woman : Copy, 1507. You test too. 
 The other carjacker's still on the loose. 
 Maybe we should drive by some parking garages. 
 Wow. Mr. Rule Book wants to take initiative. 
 No. 
 We're two rookies riding together. We gotta lay low. -(Man) This is 1505... 
 Okay, why don't you just leave that thing off, Chris? 
 It's illegal to ride without your seat belt. 
 Well, real cops don't wear seat belts. 
 Oh, what? So you're a real cop, and I'm not? 
 You said it, not me. 
 Man : This is 1511... 
 Let me ask you something, Gail. 
 Anything. 
 Why are you so mean? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I need a traffic car to banner and spring for a single-car collision. 
 1507 responding, on our way. 
 Two pizza crusts. 
 Hey, do you think Gail likes me? 
 I don't think she likes anyone. 
 Are you sure? 'Cause she laughs at my jokes. 
 She's laughing at you, as in, not with you. 
 One vodka bottle, empty. 
 I don't know. I think she has a little crush. 
 Oh, come on. Ew! 
 Relax. I'm not saying I'm gonna hook up with her. 
 I'm just saying, you got to admit she's kind of sexy. 
 No, I don't. 
 One pair of undies. 
 Boy shorts, actually. 
 Ugh! Can you please explain to me how bagging panties is related to carjacking? 
 I have no idea. Ask Noelle. 
 Uh, you ask her. 
 She scares me. 
 Oh, tell me about it. 
 Oh, look at that. Box of condoms. 
 Nice. I'm starting to get a whole picture of a romantic evening that played out in this car. 
 In your world, this is romantic. 
 Come to think of it, you and Gail are perfect for each other. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 (Chris) 1507 on the scene. 
 Woman : E.M.S. is en route. 
 Sir, an ambulance is on its way. 
 It might be better if you just sat tight. 
 I tried to brake. I... I... I did. 
 The car seemed to have a... a... a mind of its own. 
 I can get a statement from you once the paramedics check you out, okay? 
 It was an accident. 
 I've never had one, not... not in 50 years. 
 Is... is he okay? 
 (Chris) Is the lady hurt? 
 She wasn't involved. 
 She came around the corner, she saw this, she called 9-1-1. 
 Uh, no, no, sir. Sir, you should wait for the ambulance. 
 No, no. Is... is he dead? 
 Who? 
 D... did... did you check? 
 Chris! 
 Okay. 
 Keep an eye on the driver. 
 (Chris) 1507. We've got an injured cyclist here. 
 Where's the ambulance? 
 Sir, can you hear me? 
 I don't understand. We have his gun. 
 But we can't tie it to the murder, and Kraker knows it. 
 The bullet went through the victim's neck, severed the jugular and exited. But there was no bullet found at the scene, so where'd the bullet go? 
 Car. 
 Car went to impound. 
 They tore it apart into tiny little pieces. 
 Well, I know how much you like surprises. 
 I hate surprises. 
 I got a tip from one of the nurses in emergency. 
 About? 
 I'll let you know if I'm right. 
 Ooh, you're not one of those guys that has to be right all the time, are you? 
 I don't mind pretending you're right sometimes. 
 We're gonna say hello to one Benjamin Kelly, 21. 
 Short sheet... shoplifting, theft under a thousand. 
 Suspect? 
 Not yet. I just need to talk to him. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. Hey, hey. You... you got the wrong guy. 
 What are you arresting me for? 
 Nobody's arresting you. 
 I didn't do nothing. 
 We heard a rumor you suffered a serious injury last week. 
 Hey, have a seat. Have a seat. Sit down. 
 Just want to ask you a few questions... on how you got that 9-millimeter bullet in your head. 
 Uh, is there anyone you'd like us to call? 
 Huh? No. Uh, no. I, uh, I live alone. 
 Um, any family? A... anyone you work with? 
 Work with? At my age? 
 I'm actually flattered. 
 Well, the E.M.S. will finish checking you out. 
 You're a very nice young man. Very courteous. 
 You're a... you're a good boy. 
 (Jerry) Diaz. 
 Yeah. Excuse me. 
 Oh, of course. Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. 
 He tell you what happened? 
 Uh, cyclist swerved in front of him, car had a mind of its own. 
 You know... (Scoffs) should be mandatory retesting for every driver over 50. 
 I think he's in shock. Poor old guy. 
 Goes out for a drive, ends up killing someone. It's awful. 
 Yeah? A little bit worse for the cyclist, wouldn't you say? 
 Okay, I'm gonna wait for the coroner. 
 You and Gail make sure the old guy's car gets to impound. All right? 
 Uh, yes, sir. 
 Okay. 
 Man, what the hell have you been smokin'? 
 How could I be walking around with a bullet in my head? 
 Where are we taking him? 
 We're not taking him anywhere. We're taking evidence. 
 He just happens to be along for the ride. 
 Hey, he can hear you, jackbrain. 
 Yo, give me my phone back, man. I want to call my lawyer. 
 I know my rights. 
 You haven't been arrested. 
 Well, then this constitutes... unlawful... containment! 
 Unlawful confinement. 
 Which is not applicable here. 
 Uh, this is more, uh, investigative detention. 
 We are taking him to the hospital, right? 
 Oh, yeah. And we're gonna get an X-ray of that bullet. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no. Hey, hey. 
 I don't do hospitals, okay? 
 Look, they're gonna give me a needle or something. 
 I don't want anything to do with that. 
 You should've thought of that before you got hooked up with a bunch of carjackers, jackbrain. 
 I don't like x-rays. They freak me out. 
 Okay, well, then try to get your mind off of it. 
 Maybe tell me what happened when the guy got shot at the parking garage. 
 I don't remember any parking garage. 
 I got a bullet in my head, remember? 
 You know, you dress pretty nice for a guy who doesn't have a job. 
 Who says I don't have a job? I freelance. 
 Is that so? 
 (Chuckles) Yeah. 
 I mean, look, a regular job just doesn't pay enough. 
 I got a lot of expenses. 
 I'm serious! 
 Yeah? 
 Look, I got a sick mama. (Laughs) 
 A sick mama. Wow, original. 
 Wow. You have a hard time trusting people, don't you? 
 No. 
 You know... you look really trustworthy, so I'm-a tell you the truth. 
 I got a lot of people relying on me. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah! A lot of people. 
 Look, I'm like their personal A.T.M., okay? 
 (Laughs) Shut up. 
 Don't laugh. It ain't funny. I'm serious. 
 Officer, look. It's not easy trying to be the hero. 
 It really isn't. 
 (Luke) They're ready for us. 
 Don't look so scared, Benny. 
 Officer McNally will hold your hand. 
 The object measures just under a centimeter. 
 Right, with a 9-millimeter bullet. 
 It entered here, partially penetrated the skull, embedded itself in the frontal lobe. It's... 
 Oh, hold on. It's in my brain? 
 If you're going to get shot in the head, the frontal lobe's the best spot. 
 And, uh, it also was slowed down by... I understand it... it passed through another victim? 
 Exactly. 
 No way. I wasn't there, all right! 
 I live in a rough neighborhood. 
 It was a stray bullet. 
 Are you in any pain? 
 A lot of pain. I think I need painkillers. 
 Look, um... can... can you remove it? 
 Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. 
 You asked for an X-ray. 
 Listen, just... 
 Yeah. The fact is that people can survive years with shrapnel lodged in their bodies. 
 So I'll... I'll be okay. 
 I can live with it, right? 
 My concern here is the bullet. 
 I need this to put a murderer in jail. 
 And I need the patient's consent in order to proceed. 
 Yeah. And I don't give it. 
 Fine. I'll get a search warrant. 
 McNally? 
 You stay here. Keep an eye on our man Benny. 
 I'm gonna talk to the prosecutor. 
 There's a surgeon on shift who's willing to operate. 
 Okay, but we're sure that, you know, he's involved? Like, he's not just a witness? 
 There's a bullet inside his head that killed a man that we all know came from Kraker's gun. 
 I need that bullet. 
 Okay, what do I do if he tries to leave? 
 Keep him talking, gain his trust. 
 If anyone can do it, it's you. 
 Who knows? Maybe you can convince him to do it. 
 I'll check on you later. 
 Those pills should knock him out for a couple hours. 
 I'll be back. 
 Okay. 
 You doing okay? 
 Oh... I don't like hospitals. 
 I think I like sedatives, though. 
 Benny, can we please talk about last week? 
 Last week? 
 The parking garage. 
 I know you saw Kraker shoot that man. 
 You know, it just would... it would really help me out if you could tell me exactly what happened. 
 Or not. 
 Gail, your seat belt. 
 Crap. 
 Wait, what are you doing? 
 I got blood on my shirt. 
 Can you stop staring? 
 I'm not staring. 
 So what did the old geezer have to say for himself? 
 He's, like, a retired schoolteacher. 
 He's 80. 
 Shouldn't have been on the road. 
 You know the guy that he killed? He has, like, kids. 
 Poor guy was on the way to work. 
 You know, the driver was probably on, like, a senior's cocktail. I've seen that before. 
 Senior's cocktail? 
 Yeah, my grandmother was on it. 
 She was on, like, ten different kinds of medication, and she just acted like a crazy bat out of hell at the slightest provocation. 
 He didn't seem crazy. 
 In shock, maybe. But he called me a good boy. 
 That's really creepy. 
 Right? 
 Probably high as a kite. 
 You know, I probably should've asked him about that... like, if he was on any type of medication or anything. 
 Yeah, Chris, you probably should've asked him that. 
 You gonna put your belt on? 
 Putting my seat belt on, okay? I'm buckling up. 
 You happy? 
 Excuse me? 
 Where's the guy in 402? 
 Uh, he... he woke up, had to go to the can. 
 Hey. 
 Sammy, you gotta change that ringer, man. It's deadly. 
 Yeah. (Turns off ringtone) 
 What? 
 (Andy) I need your help. 
 I thought you were with Callaghan. 
 Yeah, well, he left me in charge of guarding some evidence. 
 Well, it's a witness, actually, it's a witness with some evidence. 
 McNally, I already have a headache. 
 Look, I lost the witness, okay? 
 And the doctor said he was gonna be asleep for hours. 
 The doctor said? The doctor is not a cop. 
 Where's Callaghan? 
 Okay, listen, I gotta find this kid before Luke finds out that I lost him. 
 And I care because, uh... 
 You care because if Boyko finds out that I screwed up this carjacking case, take a wild guess which training officer he's gonna drag into his office and scream at for half an hour. 
 All right, all right. All right. Calm down. 
 What do you need? 
 Okay, Luke brought in this kid, Benjamin Kelly, and all of his personal effects are in booking. 
 See if you can find his cell phone. 
 Jeez. 
 Oh, and, um, Luke took the car, so could you pick me up? 
 Please? 
 Yeah. 
 This one just came in. 
 It's an accident. Contents need to be catalogued. 
 Sure thing. 
 Yes? 
 Uh, we were just wondering, uh, if there was anything in particular we were looking for, with regards to the carjackings. 
 You know how some people say that, uh, there's no stupid questions? 
 They're wrong. 
 Dov, this is just overflow from the impound lot. 
 Okay, we're painting a fence here. We're rookies. 
 This has nothing to do with the carjackings. 
 Uh, we've got some bills... paid. 
 Pen. Broken pen. 
 Maps, folded. 
 And a tin of, I don't know, friggin' peppermint. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 Hi. Join the fun. 
 Yeah, we were actually on the scene of this one. 
 Oh, whoa. Let me guess... uh, old guy. 
 How'd you know? 
 Nothing says golden years like a tin of peppermints. 
 Fatal? 
 Uh, yes, for the cyclist that he hit. 
 Yeah, we're looking for, uh, any evidence of too many meds. 
 If the driver was taking a lot of pills, it might explain what happened. 
 See, Chris is kind of worried about the old guy. 
 I think it's sweet. 
 Well, knock yourselves out. 
 Yeah, we'll take it from here. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 I'm telling you, Gail totally wants to get with me. 
 Now I'm not saying I'm gonna ask her out, but... 
 Please shut up. 
 What's with you today? 
 Who is she? 
 Keisha Simmons. Number one on Benny's speed dial. 
 Oh, thanks for bringing her in. 
 Yeah. Remember... she's under no obligation to answer any questions, so... don't push your luck. 
 Be nice. Ask the important questions first. Got it? 
 Yeah, got it. 
 All right. 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 What did Benny do now? 
 I just want to talk to him. You a friend of his? 
 Ex. Very ex. 
 Never-want-to-see- the-bastard-again ex. 
 Hmm. 'Cause you're number one on his speed dial. 
 Yeah, and the last time he called, I told him I didn't want to talk to him... not then, not ever. 
 What do you want to talk to him about? 
 He's helping us with an investigation. 
 Helping the police? 
 Doesn't sound like the Benny I know. 
 The other cop said I was free to go any time I wanna, and I wanna. Uh, okay, well, if you hear from him, tell him to call me? 
 Sure, but I'm not gonna hear from him. 
 Listen, does Benny have a sick mother? 
 Mm. His parents are dead. 
 He used his mother's funeral excuse on me twice. 
 Okay, well, if you were trying to find him, where would you look? 
 I wouldn't look. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, I was thinking that maybe we should check out... 
 Previous addresses? 
 I'm way ahead of you. Here's his latest. 
 37 Seneca Drive... Dabramo, initial's m." 
 Any warrants? 
 None in the system. 
 Maybe it's a girlfriend. 
 Yeah, maybe. You know, if this guy was a witness to your carjacking murder, you'd better hope you find him before Kraker's buddy does. 
 Well, Benny didn't seem too worried about that. 
 Well, I should really go with you. 
 No, no, no, listen. I totally screwed this up. 
 I need to fix it. So just lend me the keys to your truck. 
 I'm gonna go look at the address, and then you can blow the whistle on me and ruin my entire career. 
 I'm sorry. You want to borrow my truck? 
 Okay, we can just go talk to Boyko right now. No problem. 
 Brakes are touchy, all right? 
 Just careful. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, pal, I thought, uh, Callaghan has your rookie today. 
 Yeah, well, Callaghan's busy. 
 Oh. 
 What? I'm helping her out. 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
 Find anything? 
 Mm, gramps needs to pay his auto club bill. 
 He's got perfect penmanship, but there's no pill receipts. 
 Is there, uh, any numbers? Anyone we can call? 
 Nope. 
 There's gotta be someone. 
 Maybe if we knew where he was going... 
 Wait. That's weird. 
 What? 
 Well, that's the cyclist's address in the beaches... and that's where we found him dead on the side of the road. 
 W... what? 
 Oh, this is... this is great. 
 We're stuck here handling the world's grossest evidence while everybody else is out working actual cases. 
 I know. It's disgusting. 
 Absolutely nothing cool about this job. 
 Can I see that? 
 What is it? 
 Uh, it's a saber from "The righteous war of the pontoon pirates." 
 Which is? 
 Video game. Man, I always wanted one of these. 
 Never got it. 
 Now okay, what is with you today? 
 Leo's Dad bought him a toy gun. 
 So? 
 I don't want Leo playing with guns. 
 What? Were your parents letting you play with guns? 
 No. My mom only bought us educational toys from Sweden. 
 We were on a strict diet of peace, love and baby... whoa! 
 Blood. 
 No way. 
 Yes way. 
 That is so coffee. 
 No, it's blood. I'll bet you 20 bucks. 
 We'll go ask Noelle. 
 Not it. 
 Oh, come on. She likes you. 
 She's had it in for me since day one. 
 Okay, fine. I'll go ask her. You, uh, bag it up. 
 Okay, okay. All right. I'm going. 
 Hey. Oh. 
 It's not what it looks like. 
 Sorry. 
 They're hormones. Shut the door. 
 I'm really sorry. I had no idea. 
 It's... it's harder than it looks. 
 I need the mirror to... to hit the right spot. 
 This must look pretty desperate, huh? 
 Fertility clinic, sperm donor... you know what I see when I look at this thing? 
 I see nine years... nine years with the same guy who didn't want kids. 
 Same guy who just had a baby with his new girlfriend. 
 Well, I don't know. 
 I see someone who wants something so much that she's willing to stick a needle in her ass to get it. 
 You know, it's not easy finding someone, doing this job. 
 I don't want to scare you, but it's true. 
 Well, having a kid's not gonna make it any easier. 
 I don't want to scare you, but that's true. 
 Is this your first time? 
 Yep. 
 I gotta do 'em twice a day for two weeks. 
 And it's, uh, kind of wigging me out. 
 You know, like, stabbing yourself with a needle... it's a little... counterintuitive. 
 You want me to do it? 
 Thing is, uh, Boyko's gone in a few weeks, and I'm up for a promotion. 
 So if this... if this doesn't work out, then I want those stripes. 
 And if, uh, if anyone finds out, I'll know it was you. 
 I won't tell a soul. 
 Hey. What's happenin'? 
 Sorry, I'm still trying to track down this prosecutor, which is taking a lot longer than I thought. 
 Oh, oh, totally. Cool. You know, you should take your time. 
 How's our guy? Please tell me you've talked him into giving up the bullet so I can get the hell out of here. 
 Uh... 
 Hang on. I'm getting another call. 
 It's the prosecutor. I gotta go. Call you back. 
 I... 
 Come on. 
 Hello, Benjamin. 
 How'd you find me? 
 You're coming with me. 
 I can't. 
 Okay, then I'll arrest you. 
 What? 
 Let's go! 
 Okay, all right! Just give me a minute. 
 Benny, who are you talkin' to? 
 It's okay, mama. It... it's for me. 
 There better be a damn good explanation for this. 
 Officer, if he's giving you any trouble... 
 Mama, this is Officer McNally, and I've been... I've been helping her out. 
 It's true. 
 He's been helping me out. 
 Well, then, come on inside. 
 Don't just stand there! 
 Okay. 
 Look at me. Look at the state of this place. 
 You gonna take all day down there? 
 Want a cup of coffee? 
 Oh, no coffee, thank you. Uh, we're actually in a hurry. 
 You're Benny's mother? 
 Foster mother. At least, I was. 
 Too much of a smart-ass now to listen to me anymore. 
 Marie Dabramo. 
 Andy. 
 Doesn't stop you telling me what to do. 
 I should have thrown him out years ago. 
 Yeah. That why you want me to visit you every day? 
 Benny, you almost done down there? 
 He's a good boy, most of the time. 
 But I could've drowned by the time you got here. 
 I told you I was gonna be here, and I am. 
 Okay. 
 That should hold for now. 
 I'll fix it for real later, okay? 
 Later? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, you're not gonna leave me with this mess. 
 Mrs. Dabramo, I'm sorry. 
 Benny's assisting us with a really important investigation. We've gotta go. 
 Yeah. I... I mean I promise I'll be back, okay? 
 All right? Mwah. Thank you. 
 You're not gonna assist anybody dressed like that. 
 No, we really don't have time. 
 No, I've got a fresh shirt out here for you. 
 I know because I washed it. 
 So where's the other guy... Detective fancy pants? 
 He's meeting us. 
 Why are you with him, anyway? 
 I'm detailed to homicide. 
 Shots fired at 37 Seneca Drive. 
 I need backup. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, you saved my life. 
 I'm sick and tired of you lying to me, Benny. 
 When are you gonna admit you were working with these carjackers, huh? 
 Okay, okay. I... I was at the parking garage. 
 But I didn't know Kraker. I only knew the other guy Mike. 
 He told me him and one of his boys were gonna boost some stereos and that they would pay me to keep six. 
 Lookout. 
 Is that really the truth? 
 I needed money. All right? 
 But then they... they jacked the guy's car, and I didn't know they had a gun, okay? 
 I swear I didn't know they had a gun. 
 The guy freaks, he runs right at me, and Kraker shoots him. He falls right on top of me. 
 I go down. I'm covered in blood, and I got this crazy, crazy headache. 
 Then I realize... he's dead... and I got this. 
 (Who's Mike? 
 Mike Simmons. 
 Uh, I spoke to a Keisha Simmons. 
 That's Mike's sister. 
 You didn't tell Keisha you were looking for me? 
 Well, I... I said you were helping us out. 
 She must have called her brother. 
 Gotta play closer to the vest, lady. 
 But the way you kept your mouth shut with Marie, I... I owe you one. 
 McNally, how you doing? 
 Good. 
 Good? 
 Man, she saved my ass. 
 Yeah, she's got a lion's heart, this one. 
 Yeah, you can't go there, okay? 
 Got the guy who shot at you, pulled him over on elm Avenue. 
 Is his name Mike Simmons? 
 As a matter of fact, it is. 
 We got the shooter in custody. 
 That's what Sam just told me. 
 Why are you even here? 
 I... 
 The thing is, I, um... 
 Actually, it's my fault. 
 Officer McNally brought me. 
 I needed to pick up a few things and... and see my mom... 
 You know, if I was gonna do the operation. 
 You still need the bullet, right? 
 Nice work, McNally. 
 I'll take him to the hospital. You finish up here. 
 Well, we don't have to operate. He was there. 
 He saw the whole thing. Can't he just testify? 
 Come on. With his record? 
 Yeah, but even the doctor said surgery might not even be necessary. 
 Yeah, she also said she would operate if Benny gave his consent. 
 He's a kid. He's an uneducated kid who... 
 Who's making the first decent decision of his adult life. 
 He's doing this because of me. 
 I don't want him doing this because of me. 
 Andy, it is not your job to save people from what you think they should or shouldn't do. 
 It's your job to help close this case. 
 Okay? 
 You're the officers from the accident. 
 How are you feeling, Mr. Peterson? 
 A bit shaky. 
 I suppose I'll survive. 
 The nurse will be by any minute with the discharge papers. 
 Mr. Peterson, I'm Officer Peck. 
 You should know that we found the map on your GPS system. 
 You... you had no right to search through my personal things. 
 You knew Donald Cross. 
 Who? 
 The man you ran over this morning. 
 The man you killed. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 I'm not gonna listen to another word of this. 
 We have evidence, Mr. Peterson. 
 The GPS system in your car shows the route that Donald took every morning when he cycled to work. 
 You planned it. The guy was your student in the '80s. 
 That's when you sexually assaulted him. 
 You're a nice boy. You wouldn't listen to these lies. 
 His wife told us he was gonna have you arrested, and she also told us that Donald was contacting other students. 
 You don't want to listen to that vicious little bitch! 
 Hey, you watch your language, Mr. Peterson. 
 You keep that bitch away from me! 
 Just like Donny... telling lies, out to get me. 
 I want my lawyer. 
 Fine. You can call your lawyer from the station. 
 But right now you're under arrest for the murder of Donald Cross. Come on. 
 You know, Benny, you could still... 
 I know what you're gonna say. I'm not doing this for you. 
 Then why are you doing it? 
 That man in the garage... he died in my arms. 
 You think I want this in my head? 
 Any of it? 
 I'm getting it out. Maybe it'll help. 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 Hey, being a badass has not been working out so good. 
 I mean, look at me. 
 I got a freakin' bullet in my head. Hello. 
 I figured the odds have gotta be better playing one of the good guys. Wish me luck. 
 Okay. Good luck. 
 I'll be waiting here when you wake up. 
 I bet. Make sure I don't run away again, huh? 
 Damn straight. 
 Peace! 
 Chris, what is taking you so long? 
 I'm ready. 
 Hey. We caught a murderer. 
 Hi. 
 We did. We caught a murderer! 
 If you hadn't have been so nice and wanted to look for his prescription... 
 If you hadn't thought he was creepy... 
 Did you see the look on Jerry's face? 
 Did you see Boyko's face? 
 We should celebrate or something. 
 Yes. 
 I mean, uh, do you want to get a drink? Are... are you free? 
 Whoa. A drink? We just solved a homicide in one day all by ourselves, and you're asking me for one drink? 
 Or... or two? 
 Two! Wow, I got you up to two drinks, Diaz. 
 Do you have a curfew or something? 
 'Cause we caught a murderer. 
 We did. 
 We did. 
 We caught a murderer. 
 And you don't need a note from your mom to go out.

 I should have known. 
 I should have known it wasn't blood. It was just coffee. 
 Another red-letter day for Officer Epstein. 
 Ha ha! Thank you. 
 So what were you and Noelle talking about for so long? 
 I don't know. Family stuff, kids. 
 You still worried about Leo? 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. Yeah, you know, I am. 
 'Cause he's not growing up with the same advantages you had, Epstein, with your big ol' family, educational toys, never playing with guns. 
 Whoa. Who said I never played with guns? 
 I said I wasn't allowed to play with guns. 
 Why is it such a big deal? 
 Doesn't need to be such a big deal. 
 It's just a little piece of plastic, you know? 
 It's just a little toy. 
 But I look at my kid, and he's got this gun out, and he's pretending to shoot people dead. 
 ♪ when they aren't looking ♪ 
 It makes me feel like... like a disreputable single mom with violent tendencies? 
 You're not. 
 You're... you're a cop who carries a gun to protect people, and you've got a little kid who wants to be just like you. 
 Well, if you say so. 
 Wildest boy I ever had. 
 Five foster homes before I got to him. 
 It's a miracle he turned out as well as he did. 
 Hmm. I'm sure a lot of that had to do with you. 
 He's a good kid. 
 Just needed someone to see past his record, see who he really was. 
 He's really lucky to have you.

 I didn't know how to number it. 
 You can take care of that. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Wait. Stop. 
 Wait. 
 This isn't your fault. 
 The surgeon... she would have never operated if she thought this was gonna... 
 I know. She said it would be risky. It's nobody's fault. 
 It's just a fluke. 
 It was. 
 This bullet is gonna put a killer behind bars. 
 You should feel good about that. That's a good thing. 
 No, it's not a good thing, Luke! 
 You know, maybe it's right. 
 Maybe it's... it's a part of being a good cop. 
 But you know what? I don't even know anymore. 
 All I know is that he was a good kid. 
 He was a decent kid. 
 You know what? This isn't... this isn't even about the bullet. 
 Okay? It's... it's not about the bullet. 
 I don't know if I can... even if it's right, I cannot be this kind of cop. 
 People are gonna get hurt. 
 People are gonna die... good people, no matter what we do, in spite of what we do. 
 I'm sorry, Officer McNally. 
 It doesn't matter what kind of cop you want to be. 
 That's just something you're gonna have to get used to. 
 That's the reality. That's the job. 
 Why don't you let me finish this up? 
 I'll meet you at The Penny. 
 Are you coming in for a drink, pal? 
 Oh, so you're still feelin' it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Hair of the dog, my friend. It's the only cure. 
 Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm just waitin' for my keys. 
 And you, my friend, ought to go straight home and go to bed. 
 Yeah, yeah. You're taking care of everybody today. 
 Are you, uh, are you waiting for your rookie? 
 No, I told you. I'm waiting for my keys. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, uh, Sammy, training officers and rookies... can't... 
 I'm gonna go. I'll be at The Penny if you... want to... yeah, anything. 
 All right. 
 Hi. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, good night. 
 Thank you for the car. 
 Heard about your witness. 
 Ugh. Yeah, he was never a witness. 
 He was always just evidence. 
 It's.. 
 This job is... 
 I guess I just have to get used to it, right? 
 You need anything? 
 Want to go for a drink? Need a ride home? 
 No. I just need to... 
 Actually, what do you know about plumbing? 
 Jump in. 
 Can't wait to see where this is going.
