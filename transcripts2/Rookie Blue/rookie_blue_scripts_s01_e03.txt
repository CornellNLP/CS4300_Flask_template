 Open up! 
 Dad, are you in there? 
 This is Tommy. Leave a message. 
 (Horn blares) 
 (Andy gasps) 
 (Whack) 
 (Glass shatters) 
 (Panting) 
 (Glass clinking) 
 Dad, come on. Come on, please wake up. 
 Come on, get up. Please! Dad, get up! (Slaps face) 
 (Man speaking indistinctly on TV) Get up! 
 Hey. You're okay. 
 You're okay. 
 (Grunts) 
 What are you doin' here? 
 We were supposed to meet for lunch. 
 I called you, like, 18 times. 
 The phone's off. 
 (Horn honks in distance) 
 Hey. What's going on with my window? 
 Like I said, you didn't answer my calls. 
 So? 
 You know, what is wrong with you? 
 You know, this is exactly what happened last year when I found you with a bunch of booze and sleeping pills. 
 Come on! 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 I'm glad you got me up. Dad, it's not fine. 
 (Grunts) I, uh... 
 (Exhales deeply) 
 I promised I would help set up Fite Nite. 
 You're going to Fite Nite? 
 Well, it's a fund-raiser for retired cops. 
 I'm a retired cop. 
 Yeah, and you haven't gone since. 
 Well, it wasn't exactly a... 
 A gold watch exit, you know? 
 Look, don't worry. 
 I'm not gonna drink. Not tonight. 
 It's a new leaf, I swear. 
 Come on. Help me out, will ya? 
 Come on. Keep moving. 
 I am moving. 
 There you go. All right, but keep your guard up, all right? You don't want to get hurt, you gotta protect yourself. There you go. 
 Do you guys realize that a rookie from 15 division has won Fite Nite every year for the last... 12 years? 
 Jab, jab, cross. There you go. That's good. 
 Man, if you lose, everybody is gonna hate you. 
 That's good. Jab, jab, cross. All right? Oh! What are you... 
 Sorry! Sorry! Man! 
 Dov, you're not helpin'. 
 Hey, guys, you know, there's a briefing in 20, right? 
 You know, even if you don't win, they'll still respect you. 
 Good luck. (Door creaks) 
 (Sighs) Bitch. 
 Hey, hey, come on. Shake it off. Let's go. 
 Come on. One, one, two. All right? Those swipes comin'. 
 These bullets are designed to go through your vests. 
 They're designed to kill police. 
 That's their purpose. 
 2 cops killed in what, the last 18 months? 
 (Lowered voice) Hey. What happened to you? 
 It's a long story. 
 Officer McNally. Good lunch? Tasty dessert? 
 Sorry I'm late, sir. 
 You guys are eyes only. 
 Anything goes down, you call it in. You sit tight. 
 You know your assignments. Nash, Epstein, you're in the truck. 
 Diaz, you're here with me. Peck, McNally, you're on the back of the building. 
 Peck, since you were here for the briefing, you're in charge back there. 
 All right, kids, we roll in five. 
 Give me five minutes to get cleaned up, okay? 
 Yeah, take your time. 
 (Police radio chatter, indistinct conversations) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. It's you. 
 I can see how you made Detective. 
 Hey, you, uh, you going to fite nite? 
 Yeah, soon as I'm off shift. 
 Um, actually, my friend Traci's fighting. 
 Chris has been coaching her all week. Are you goin'? 
 I got a suspect in interview, but if I ever get done, yeah. 
 McNally, step it up! 
 Gotta go. 
 (Clears throat) 
 Woman : Can I get a radio check on channel 2 for all tango units? 
 (Dog barking in distance) 
 This is Epstein. We've got eyes on our U.C. 
 Man : Tango 4. Check. 
 Woman : Tango 3. 
 Man : He's approaching the front doors of the building. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 (Jerry) Okay, let's get settled. Here we go. 
 No way. That's Boyd? He's gotta be 20 pounds lighter. 
 Yeah, U.C. looks good on him. 
 (Chris) That's our guy? 
 No, that's my guy. 
 He's been working Beljac for three months now... 
 Who should be here any minute. 
 Can he hear you? 
 We can't give him an earpiece. 
 That's why we got the apartment wired. 
 Good. Okay, let's clear the operational channel. 
 (Static) What's wrong with the level? 
 (Frequencies squeaking) 
 Whoa. Hello, bad guy. 
 You have any bullets I might purchase? 
 Oh, yes, I do. Here's some money. 
 Uh, would you like to count said money? 
 Yeah, well, I guess... I guess I should. 
 20, 40, 60, 80. You guys got this? Check, check check? Okay, well, here's the party. Is that Boyd? I thought the camera added 10 pounds. Don't you have work? Yeah, paperwork. Buddy, it's the worst. Okay, S.W.A.T.'s teed up. How about eyes? Two in the building, two in the bucket. You definitely drew the long straw. I know. It's awesome. This is a major takedown, pal, and you are a crucial part of it. So I need you to go down the stairs, out the door one block west, three buildings north. Okay. Uh... what am I doing? I'll take a large black. Jerry's a double-double with sweetener. Oliver? Yeah, no... no-fat chai latte. Man : We're looking for a silver SUV being driven by the target... Beljac, Caucasian, 5'10", 41 years of age. (Mouth full) What are you doing? I need to pee. I forgot. I was all psyched to be gearing up for surveillance. And how stupid are we? "Who wants to be in the bucket?" We actually put up our hands. Are you kidding me? Surveillance is awesome. We're right in the middle of the action. Should've worn a diaper. Oh. How about this? And what kind of aim do you think I have? Hey, can I leave the van if it's a medical emergency? Not if you ever want to be cut loose. (Grunts) Have you ever been white-water rafting? You dating anyone these days? Um, nope. Nope. You? It's just that you and Swarek seem kind of friendly. Hmm? I'm not saying he's not adorable in a sort of bossy, rough trade kind of way. Just... just be careful. Okay? That's all. I mean, he... he's your training officer, and you're a rookie. It's kind of a no-no. It's actually a rule. Yeah, well, it doesn't need to be, 'cause he's not my type. Oh, shut up. He'd be anybody's type. (Chuckles) Okay. He's all yours. Look. Silver S.U.V. That's him. Uh, Peck here. Silver S.U.V. heading southwest on Green Street. Too much tint to see how many occs. (Whispers) "Occupants." Okay, guys, we got eyes on Beljac. He's heading up Green Street. Keep 'em peeled. (Telephone ringing) What'd I miss? Jerry's sweetener? He likes the blue kind. Give that man a headset. Man : Tango 9. We've got eyes. SUV's approaching fleet. (Clears throat) Peck, McNally, what are you seeing? He's heading south on Fleet Street, sir. Epstein, Nash, he's coming at you. Roger that. (Plastic bag crinkling) He's parking. We got him on the street. (Men speaking indistinctly) You guys hearing that? (Men shouting indistinctly) (Frequencies squeaking) What's he saying? He, uh, he's saying that he loves you. The level's screwed. No, there's background noise. Some kind of argument. But who's arguing? Where? Somebody gonna do something about that? We can't lose this wiretap. (Men arguing indistinctly) Who's hearing this? It's up here, sir. Where is here," McNally? Third floor, southwest end of the hallway. (Indistinct arguing continues) The target Beljac... he's headed for the building. Okay, this is a problem. I'm calling Boyd. Let me put my rooks on it. Wait. Are they up to it? Peck, McNally, make 'em shut up now, whatever it takes. Okay. Follow my lead. (Indistinct arguing continues) And do not shout "Police!" (Lowers voice) Roger that. (Man) Mind your own business and get the hell outta here! Somebody needs to get up there and stop it. Can you hear me? Man, get outta here! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Keep your voices down. There's been a complaint about the noise. I'll give you a complaint. This guy is out of his mind. Shut up. Look what this drunk did to my face. A drunk? You think I'm drunk? Come on, pal! Hey! Peck, McNally, hurry up. The target's in the building. Man : Get off me! Hands, head now. (Handcuffs clicking) Come on. (Man) You're not taking him? (Gail) Just shut up! Target's heading up the north stairs. Quiet. You're right on top of him. Shh! (Lowered voice) It's under control. (Knocks on door) (Frequency squeaks, static) We alone? And Beljac's in the apartment. Here, have a look around. Let's see what's in the bag. Count it. 48 cases. 50 rounds per case, so that's 2,400 rounds. There's the money shot. What do you think? A lot of dead cops. Target is leaving the apartment. Happy trails. Ahem. And... Takedown. Takedown. (Tires screech, siren wailing) Those guys are just backup. Real S.W.A.T.'s in there already... smoke bombs, dropping through ceilings on pulleys. Nope. They're in the next door apartment. What? Jerry told me. (Men speaking indistinctly) Woman : Target is in custody. Repeat... target is in custody. (Laughs) (Police radio chatter) Ahem. All right. (Police radio chatter) Who the hell is that guy? One of Beljac's crew? He saw the S.W.A.T. guys. We're not allowed to leave the van. No one else is seeing this! He's getting away! Don't! This is Epstein. I have one of Beljac's crew fleeing the scene! (Police radio chatter) Police! Out of the way! (Traci) North entrance on... (Speaks indistinctly) Square! (Man coughing) Do not move! We got him. We got him. Other hand. (Handcuffs clicking) (Jerry) Dispatch, this is barber. Woman : Go ahead, Detective. Second suspect has been apprehended. I need 1522 to stand by for transport. Man : 10-4. Nice. Hey, you know why I punched him? You know why? He was gonna hit her. Can you sit back, sir? He was! I swear! He walked in. We were just talkin', havin' a coffee... (Chuckles) You don't smell like coffee. Yeah, what she means is you stink, so get your face away from the cage. And then he grabbed her around the neck. What was I supposed to do? Look, you're gonna have all the time in the world to tell this to a judge, all right? They're only been married for three years, and he hits her all the time. She comes in to work... she'll complain to anyone who's listening. What was that for? I told him to sit back. You all right? Yeah. I'm sorry, okay? I'm just sayin'... you got the wrong guy. (Horn honks) (Door squeaks, police radio chatter) (Indistinct conversations) Did you, uh, find a bathroom yet? Nice work, Detective. Congratulations. I need to talk to officer Nash. I know. I'm sorry. I held it as long as I... What the hell were you thinking? You left the surveillance van. The guy was taking off. Your orders were to stay in the van. Traci, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna... I'm gonna have to report this. Are you reporting Dov? Epstein was just backing you up. Oh, my God. This is about the other night, isn't it? What? I told you I was training with Chris. This isn't personal, okay? Well, that's funny, 'cause it feels incredibly personal. Okay, you're gonna get a copy of the report after the boss sees it. Jerry. Maybe he was right. Maybe we shouldn't have left her alone with her husband. We were just there about the noise, Andy. That doesn't matter. I mean, if she's in trouble... Yeah, well, she could have said something. She didn't have a chance. It was by the book. I know. It's just... it feels... Her husband looked creepy. So she married a creep. There's really nothing that we can do about it. You did such an awesome job, you go back and book him. What happened? She forgot to pee before she got in the truck. Kind of went downhill from there. (Velcro rips) Traci, hey. Please don't be nice to me. I can't handle that right now. Okay. Just making sure you're all right. Jerry's reporting me. Apparently, I didn't follow orders, and I burned the surveillance van. The list goes on. But hey, it's not personal. So you're okay, though? I'm fighting. Don't worry. Your nails. I know. They're gross. The fight that Gail and I broke up at the apartment... the husband's face was all scratched up. A man wouldn't do that, would he? Scratch? No. Men don't scratch. We're gonna knock 'em dead tonight. You're in the women's locker room. Okay. Hey. Traci's gettin' her gear. What are you still doing in uniform? That kid I arrested... he won't cough up his name. You're not coming? You gotta cheer for us. I gotta go through mug shots, figure out who he is. I know the guy, okay? He's not gonna talk. There's nothing we can offer that's... that's gonna make him give this up. What happened? Beljac showed up short. He only had 2,400 rounds on him. He still goes away, though, right? Yeah, but that doesn't keep the rest of the bullets off the street. "Off the street"? They even have paved roads where you're from? You get your John Doe's name yet? Working on it, sir. Well, be finished working on it. Right away. What about Fite Nite? I know. I just want to look them up, see if we missed anything. Missed what? You know our job is just to shut them up, right? I know, but the guy we left at the apartment had scratches all over his face. The guy we arrested didn't scratch him, 'cause men don't scratch. Maybe they have a cat. Okay. Melanie Harlowe. Same address. And she charged her husband with assault two years ago. Maybe she was just defending herself. We gotta go back. No, we don't. We left her alone with him. (Man shouting indistinctly) See? You hear that? So they scream at each other, Andy. That's not cause. Okay, well, what then? I mean, we knock on the door, then he knows we're here. Yeah, but isn't that the point? No, because then the second we're gone, he's gonna pick up where he left off. You know, maybe I should just go around and check through a window. We're the police, Andy. We can't go looking through people's windows. (Melanie screaming) Let's get him. (Screams) Police! Police! (Shouts indistinctly) Come here! Up against the wall. Hands behind your back! It's okay. That's all right. You're okay. Melanie! Shut up! You're gonna be fine. (Panting) Dispatch, I need a uniform car to transport a subject to the barn. (Andy) Okay, it's gonna be fine. (Chuckles) Oh, you think that's funny? I didn't... I didn't do anything. Andy? What? You better not. Not until they take a photograph. (Whimpering) Right. Okay. Okay. (Melanie crying) Oh, my God. Here. All right. It's okay. It's all right. Okay? I came back for you. I'm gonna help you. Okay? Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. (Crying) (Indistinct conversations) Hey, Nash. You know, you have some heavy shoes to fill. Sarge here... he fought his rookie year. Certainly did. Kicked some ass. And guess what? That's why I'm the boss. Well, she's looking good, sir. We've been working really hard. Well, she better be. I just bet 500 bucks on you. (Crowd shouting indistinctly) No pressure! It's gonna be great. We got about half an hour. You want a... you want a soda water or something? Mr. McNally! (Slurring) Traci Nash! How's it going, huh? It looks like you're in tough. (Crowd shouting indistinctly, jump rope whooshing) Sh... she's a rookie? A ringer. Not even police. She's been temping at 17 for a couple of weeks. That's a secretary? Ah, she's sandbaggin'. Just relax, kid. You know, you... you look her right in the eye, eh, punches in bunches. Whatever you do, don't let her scare ya. You'll be fine. I'm bettin' on ya. Yeah, yeah, come on. Well, go easy on the scotch, Mr. McNally. It's a long night. (Crowd continues shouting indistinctly) 
 
 (Knocks) (Door buzzes, beeps) Sorry to bother you. Uh, it's just the kid, the one we... Whoa. The one who we... who ran from the S.U.V. mm-hmm. I ran his prints. Nothing. I looked through every single mug shot. No police force has ever heard of him. I thought maybe somebody else wanted to take a run at him. While you go to Fite Nite? Nice try. How you making out with Beljac? Shut up. You know what? Go get the kid. Go get him? Yeah, bring him here. He doesn't want to tell you who he is, let's stick him in with his boss. You want to throw him in there? What? No, you put him in there. We're going for coffee. (Door beeps) Man : This is 1513. We're headed back to the barn. Woman : 10-4. Have fun at Fite Nite. Are you sure you're gonna be all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. He's behind bars, right? Yeah, he's about to be. Good riddance. (Chuckles) Ow. The look on his face when you guys came through that door... he didn't know what hit him. (Laughs) You know what he does the morning after? He makes me coffee, and he sprinkles cinnamon on top of it. A couple years ago, I reported him. He got locked up. Got up the next morning, and I made my own coffee. That afternoon, he was... he was out. They let him out. Hey, it's gonna be different this time. You know, all that they made him do is sign something, and then he was back. Oh, God. Um, you know what? Can you just drop me off? Uh, uh, just pull over here and let me out. It really wasn't that bad, and I should have known better inviting Bruce over for a drink. I... I knew that Dan would get mad. No. The guy almost broke your nose. You didn't ask for that. No. You're right. I didn't. (Chuckles) Look, you're safe tonight. I promise. All right? It's gonna be different this time. Okay. (Sighs) Okay. Okay. Um, do you mind if I, uh, roll down the window? Yeah, yeah. (Whirs) (Exhales deeply) You gotta forget about everybody who's out there, okay? The chief, Boyko, all the detectives... it doesn't matter, all right? You gotta stay focused. Keep it internalized. Keep it in here. That's your psych-up talk? No, this is my psych-up talk. I think we should forfeit. I'm serious. I don't want to see you get hurt. You haven't fought in five years, and she's a ringer. Nash! Don't hit below the belt. Don't hit behind the neck. Give me a clean fight. Good luck. No problem. You sure? I got this... champ. Hey. Just got Melanie's statement. He was on her the second we left. Well, it's a good thing that we went back. Yeah. And I considered leaving him in his cell with his belt, 'cause I really wouldn't mind seeing the b*st*rd string himself up. (Laughs) Anyway, I didn't. We got a little problem. Judge says we can't hold the husband until the trial. Seems he has the right to work to support himself. So we have to let him out? Two hours. Two hours? What do we do? (Sighs) We gotta find her someplace safe. You picked a good one... cop killers. How do you think that makes people around here feel? (Door beeps) Do what you want to me. I'm not saying anything. If you're so tough, how come you've never been arrested before? Okay, here's the deal. You're ruining my night. This event's about to start... free scotch, hot, sweaty chicks banging into each other. Thing is, I don't get to go till I figure out who you are. So why don't you just tell me as a personal favor? (Telephone ringing, police radio chatter) Please? (Door beeps) I told you, I'm not saying anything. (Door closes) (Speaks foreign language) Where did he come from? (Handcuffs clicking) Caught him fleeing the scene with an illegal weapon. Sit down. You carry a gun, you're gonna get yourself in trouble. This from the man selling illegal bullets. How old are you? 24. 24? Your parents were cops? Is that it? You wanted to be just like them? No, actually, my parents were hippies. They hated cops... about the only thing they ever agreed on. I'm not supposed to be talking to you. So you went against your family's wishes. Why was that? Always knew I wanted to be a cop. So you could catch bad guys like me? Maybe. Maybe it just seemed like a way to help people out. You want to help people out? Take a look at this kid. This kid could be anything in the world. He could be you, if he would just get his head screwed on straight. You want to carry a weapon so badly, why not be like him? (Sniffles) Aamin, look at me. (Sniffles) Don't tell me what to do. Look at me. (Sniffles) I can do the time. I know you can... But I don't want you to. All right, you want to help people... really want to help people? Why not start with him? How? Get out your notebook. (Door buzzes, beeps) Oh, uh, can I talk to you for a second? Seriously? (Chuckles) Look, I'm tired. I drank way too much coffee, and I'm missing Fite Nite, which I have never done before. So this better be good. Uh, it's about the kid, the one from the s.U.V. That I threw in interview. I got his name. You got his name? You got his real name? That's amazing. We've been talking to a fence post in there, pumping quarters into him for hours. We got nothing. But you tell me you got a name? Let's go to Fite Nite, dude! Beljac. I know his name! Aamin Beljac. He's your guy's little brother. (Door beeps) (Door closes) You know, I don't even have a toothbrush. It's okay. It's a shelter. They have everything here. And they know how to protect you. Yeah, and it's a bunch of strangers. Well, try to look at that as a good thing. I mean, no matter what happens, at least Dan doesn't know where you are. You are gonna keep him locked up, right? Yeah, as long as we can. Good. Good. He has a right to be jealous of Bruce. (Sighs) It wasn't just coffee. Bruce and I had a thing a couple months back. Dan doesn't even know. It doesn't matter. He's still not allowed to hit you. I can't believe this is me, my life. I'm gonna sleep here tonight. (Sniffles) (Velcro rips) Here. Listen, call me on my cell anytime, okay? Yeah, no matter what happens tonight, you're safe here. Okay. So what now? I thought you wanted to go to Fite Nite. I do. Well, then let's go to Fite Nite. ♪ Ah! Serve, protect. You knock this chick back to 17! Yeah! Is that the chief? Hey, Nash, get over here. Richard, this is officer Nash, one of, uh, 15's finest. So I hear. Good luck out there. 15 needs to win, Nash. Well, I'll do my best, sir. All right, com. You're quick. You're fast, and you're just as smart as this chump, all right? Yeah. Let's do this thing, all right? Okay, okay. Let's go! (Crowd cheering and whistling) (Bell dings) Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth bout of the evening. In the blue corner, from 17 division, weighing in at 134 pounds... Morgan "The Strapper" Stanwell! (Cheers and applause) And in the red corner, the pride of 15, weighing in at 131 pounds... Traci "Boom-Boom" Nash! Nash! Ladies, let's dance! (Cheers and applause) (Bell dings) ♪ Woman : ♪ there are choices ♪ Come on! Push her out! Push her out! ♪ (grunting) Good job! Traci! (Continues grunting) ♪

(Crowd shouting indistinctly) (Bell dings) Well, I mean, at least she's back up on her feet. You say the word, and I'll throw the towel in, okay? You don't have to do this. You kidding? This is the good part. Hey. Hey. Hey. You look... great. Thanks. (Chuckles) Why am I doing this again? I have no idea, but since we're here, you might as well win. Come on, Trace! Pretend that she called you a slut or something. (Laughs) (Dings) ♪ (cheers and applause) Whoo! (Grunting) Come on! You got her! (Continues grunting) (Crowd continues shouting indistinctly) Come on! Stay up! You got her. You got her. (Both grunting) (Crowd cheering) In your corner! You okay? Look at me. Are you okay? ♪ (bell dinging) Aah! (Crowd cheering and whistling) Yeah! (Cheering continues) Hey! Congratulations! I hope I do as well as she did. You're fighting? No. I kind of wish I was, 'cause you would have thought that was cool. A little bit. Mm. Let me buy you a drink. It's open bar. Well, then buy me a drink. Wow, what a gentleman. (Chuckles) Uh, yeah, you know, I'm, um... rain check? Yeah, you know what? Uh, I might be at the black penny later. They're keeping it open late, so... Okay. Hey. Hey, get your hands off. I said get your hands off me! (Grunts) (Crash, men grunting) (Grunts) Dad, what are you doing? Stop! Let go! (Andy) Stop it! Okay. Let me alone! Don't touch me! What are you doing? You said you weren't gonna drink. I only had a couple. You promised me. Well, maybe I shouldn't have. Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have gotten drunk. Maybe you shouldn't have hit that guy. You know how hard it is for me to be back here? Know what that guy said to me? I don't care what he said to you. I really don't care. All right? I have to work with these people. You're embarrassed of me. (Sighs) Dad, that's not what I meant. Yeah, but you are. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? I... It's fine. Okay? All right, drinks are on me, buddy. Yeah, they're free... the only time they're gonna be on him. (Laughs) Hey! (Chris) Hello. There she is. Hey. Ooh. Are you, uh, you all right? Never better. Missed a great fight, man. She kicked ass. Yeah? Congratulations. Where's, uh, where's the guys? Two beers. What happened with the bullets? Uh, we got 'em all. But forget about that. Oh, man, that's great! How was the fight? Tell me about the fight! Tell me about the bullets! Um, okay, so, uh, the kid we arrested? Yeah? Turns out he's Beljac's little brother. Thank you. (Dov) As soon as Beljac figured out we had him in custody, he gave up on the bullets. Decent guy, actually. Didn't want his brother doing hard time. Really? Yeah. What? That's... that's... wow. (Dov) Huh? Guess you owe me an apology. You all right? The kid I chased... sounds like it was a good thing I left the surveillance van. Sounds like you wouldn't have made your case otherwise. Traci, you still disobeyed an order. I still gotta write it up. Now I told you it's not personal. You know, but you didn't have backup, and the kid had a gun. Sorry for giving a damn, all right? Sorry for caring about your safety. Caring about my safety by reporting me? Care about whatever you want. I can look after myself. Traci, I'm sorry. I won the fight, by the way. Hey, that was a nice fight. I mean, she came back, right? Of course she did. Traci's got heart. Yes, but humiliation is a pretty great motivator, don't you think? How would you know? Your godfather's the chief of police. Who's left to impress? Oh, sorry. Was that a secret or something? Listen,  I can't hear you. You need to slow down, okay? Calm down! Melanie, what? Did you answer? What? No, I... (Scoffs) They let him out 15 minutes ago. Who? Melanie's husband. Andy, she's at a shelter. She's fine. Yeah, but he called her, she answered, and she told him where she is. Well, then she's an idiot. What, did you make her answer the phone? You know, at this point, this is really not our job. We enforce the law. We don't fix screwed-up relationships. Yeah, well, I told her that she'd be safe from him. Well, I didn't. Fine.

♪ the life that I thought through is gone ♪ Thanks. Sorry about that... About Dov. Oh, God. Yeah, whatever. As if I care. Dov and Traci... they got a thing. Anybody with connections, they think they're working the system. Oh, and you don't? (Bell dings in distance) I don't know. But... you work hard, you do your job, you keep your head down... Maybe you get noticed. Maybe you don't. Doesn't matter. It's not why we're here. (Scoffs) 'Cause my Dad... he's talking to the chief. And yes, he's my godfather. My mom... she's probably, I don't know, yukking it up with the head of homicide. My brother's probably yakking with Boyko about the good old days. You know, maybe it makes a difference. Or maybe it doesn't. I really have no idea, 'cause it's not like anybody tells me anything anyway. You know, except... "Be a good cop," you know? "Do us proud." Gail. It really doesn't matter. You sure? Mm. No. ♪ Thanks for coming with me tonight. I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to ask. It's fine. It's just that I promised this woman that... You shouldn't. This job, you don't promise anything. Yeah. Melanie. Hey. Hey. He just kept calling me, and I felt really stupid not answering. What? He's here? What happened to good riddance"? Look, he knows this is messed up, okay? He feels terrible. We're gonna work things out. What does that even mean? What, so he's gonna make you coffee with cinnamon tomorrow? Maybe. Or maybe I'll make it for him. I don't know. It's none of your business! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Look... he needs me. And you won't see us again. He promised. I don't belong in there. (Car door opens) You can't do this, okay? You can't let him come in... He's never promised before, okay? It's gonna be different. I know you don't get it, but he's my husband. I completely get it. I gotta at least give him a chance. I... Melanie. I'm sorry. Hey. She... It's not up to you. You okay? Yeah. (Car doors close) (Engine starts) (Dog barking in distance) (Siren wailing in distance) Hey. Rough night? (Chuckles) Me, too. Boyko gave this to me... congratulations after the big win. (Laughs) Yeah, right. That's pretty great. I guess. (Inhales sharply) Ohh. Come on, you were badass tonight. I mean, you know why I started boxing? Huh. Crappy boyfriend in high school. He used to fight. I got into it. But when I started it, I... I would beat the hell out of someone, get angry. All those times I got called slut," got dumped... (Pops cork) it felt good to hit... to be hit. Must have felt really good tonight then. Yeah, but you won. It was fun. I mean, it was fun for a while. But now it just feels like crap. I totally get that. Look at me and my Dad. He completely humiliates me in front of everyone tonight, and I'm the one saying sorry. It's pathetic. It's no wonder you always date the wrong guys.
