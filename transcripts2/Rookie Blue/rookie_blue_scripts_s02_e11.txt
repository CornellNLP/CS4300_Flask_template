 (Siren wailing in distance) 
 And the worst part is, is I wanted Dov and Gail to get along. 
 I mean, I wanted them to spend time with each other. Man. 
 Yeah, well, the minute I decide to tell Sam about my feelings, he's gone, like... magic. 
 Really mean magic. 
 You're not gonna get away with this! Clifton, get back here! Hey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Stop! Police! 
 (Bat clatters) 
 Take it easy, officer. Take it easy. 
 Give me your hands. 
 Ohh. (Grunts) 
 (Handcuffs click) 
 Ohh. (Pants) 
 You've gotta be kidding me. 
 Look who I just caught. 
 (Horns honk in distance) 
 Did this man attack you? 
 Kind of. 
 Clifton. 
 I was just trying to talk some sense into the boy, stop him from making a very serious mistake. 
 No, you were sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. 
 That's only 'cause I believe in you, son. 
 I run a street program, and Clifton here, during the holy sacrament of confession, told me something he was fixin' to do that was very stupid, and I had to step in. 
 So what'd he say? 
 I can't share that with you. I'm bound by an oath. 
 Yeah, well, we're bound by an oath, too. 
 (Lowered voice) He's a priest. He can't be lying. 
 Pfft. Priests lie. Ever see that wafer they call bread? 
 Yeah. Come here. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Handcuffs click) 
 (Sniffles and grunts) 
 (Sniffles) You know, it's bad when you can't believe a priest. 
 (Man chuckles) Don't believe in me, brother. 
 Save it for the man upstairs. 
 God sees the big picture. 
 Like it or not, he has a plan for all of us. 
 Yeah, well, if I'm living God's plan, you can let him know that his timing's off. Way off. 
 Rookie Blue; Season 2, Episode 11 
A Little Faith 
Original Air Date: September 1, 2011 
 Absolutely. 
 Hey. What's, uh, what's going on? 
 Yeah. Okay. Okay, fine. Yeah, no. Keep... keep walking, but I didn't do anything wrong, so I'm done feeling guilty for something I didn't do. 
 Chris, come on. It's been weeks. 
 I mean, you have to get over this. Nothing happened. 
 That's not the point, okay? 
 You let him in. You went around behind my back, and you let someone get close to you. 
 You and Dov were my family... 
 And you're mine. 
 And I just stood there and let it happen. (Chuckles) 
 (Sighs) 
 Do you believe in anything? 
 Because of what happened with Luke? 
 Yes, and Sam... 
 You know, leaving like that. 
 (Sighs) Well, having faith means believing in things that don't always make sense. 
 The tooth fairy doesn't make sense. I  am  the tooth fairy. 
 Last week, Leo lost a tooth. Cost me 20 bucks. 
 20 bucks? 
 Tooth fairy didn't have any change. 
 I might not need three, but it'd be good to have, uh, you know, a few fresh faces ready, people who work the area. 
 (Lowered voice) They're totally talking about us. 
 I-I think I impressed him with the workbook stuff, so... 
 Would this have anything to do with the case Swarek is working? 
 Swarek working on a case? I... 
 Guy disappeared on me in the middle of the night. 
 Nothing but a voice mail. 
 (Whistles) Now that's just -- that's just rude. 
 Pick Peck. Pick Peck. 
 Well, I'm not choosing Peck. 
 I mean, she'd stick out in any crowd... 
 (Chuckles) 
 So I guess I'm gonna go with... eesh... McNally, Nash... 
 I don't know. Epstein? 
 Epstein? I think Diaz might be a better bet. 
 Ohh. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna stick with Epstein. 
 Epstein. Yeah. 
 Okay. Last but not least, I want to let you know that, uh, some of the rookies will be sitting out of rotation today. 
 Detective Donovan Boyd is sending three of them out on the infamous scavenger hunt, so wish 'em luck. 
 McNally, Nash, Epstein, stay behind with Boyd, and he'll brief you. 
 Peck, Diaz, you two are riding together. 
 Everybody, let's go. Come on. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 You'll be dropped off in nowheresville. Plainclothes. 
 No money. No wallet. No phones. No guns. 
 Goal is simple. Pick a character, and whatever you do, commit to it. 
 Uh, h-how do we know who we should be? 
 Be yourself, or be the opposite of yourself. 
 I don't care. Use what you know. Know what you don't know. 
 That clear it up for you? 
 No. 
 Be back here at 6:00 A.M. in uniform with as much accumulated money and drugs as possible. 
 (Chuckles) Wh... I will judge the drugs by street value, not by volume. 
 Okay. Wait, wait. No, no, no. How do we do that? 
 Come on, rookies. You are sophomores now. 
 You know how to spot a dealer. You know where they sell it. 
 Now it is your job to go a learn how to buy it, so go. 
 And, hey, you know, look, be safe out there. 
 It's not a competition. 
 All right. $20 says McNally takes it. 
 $20? Uh, let's make it $60, because Nash is taking it. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. Noelle's right. (Rips velcro) 
 McNally's got this thing... locked (High-pitched voice) up. 
 Yeah? You want to put your money where your mouth is, homicide? 
 (Normal voice) Uh... yeah, no. 
 Oh, ye of little faith. 
 Hey, what's the line on Epstein? 
 Epstein? 
 Are you betting on us? 
 Uh, no, not on you. No. 
 Nobody thinks you stand a chance. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (Chuckles) Uh, no problem. Don't mention it. 
 This sucks! 
 I should be undercover, 'cause I blend, and you... You're a born natch. 
 You have to admit, it's totally ridic. 
 Would you stop cutting your words off halfway, okay? 
 It's new. I don't... I don't like it. 
 Although there is something really brill about this sitch. 
 Stop it. 
 We get to spend the whole shift together, and we're meant to talk, Chris. 
 Don't make me get all mushy. 
 We were good together. 
 Not really. I mean, think about it. 
 We weren't normal. Yeah, but what is even normal? 
 In a normal couple, you have a mama bear and a papa bear. 
 You're more like Goldilocks. 
 Yeah, she's the only human in the story, so I'm gonna take this as a good sign. 
 Yeah, worming your way in where you aren't invited, trying out different beds to see which one fits. 
 Chris, I didn't try out different beds. 
 Yeah, well, in the metaphor, you did. 
 Woman : We've got reports of a disturbance in Mount Pleasant Cemetery. 
 Caller said she heard yelling and saw three male suspects chasing a fourth through the cemetery. 
 Mark 1505 responding. 
 (Clicks) 
 (Siren wails) 
 Aw. Look how sweet. 
 This must be where mama bear and papa bear are buried. 
 Look. 
 Holy... 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Great. Never been better. 
 Okay. Come on. Come on. Just put your hands down. 
 What about your coat? 
 You're freezing. Here. Take mine. 
 What happened to you, man? Who did this to you? 
 No idea. 
 Your wallets, phones.  Rápido, rápido. 
 One... one, two, three, and one, two, three. Great. 
 Nothing but the clothes on your back. 
 Nice. 
 Now before you go forth, young soldiers, hold out your hands. I have a present for you. 
 One, two, three. 
 Bus token. Just in case. 
 Just in case what? 
 In case you need a bus token. 
 Come on, people. Don't let me down here. 
 You cannot let them see you scared out there. 
 If you're nervous, get closer, and they won't see you shake, okay? 
 Have a little faith in yourselves, guys. 
 (Door opens and closes) (Sighs) 
 (Tires peal) 
 Ha. 
 It's a start. 
 ♪ 
 How much you get for these again? 
 10 cents. 
 10 cents? That's it? 
 Yeah, but if you get a hundred, that's 10 bucks. 
 See ya, guys. Where you going? 
 Hey, buddy dropped us in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a bus token. Doesn't take a brain surgeon to realize we're supposed to take the bus downtown. Maybe it's for emergencies. 
 He said use what we know, so... I'm using what I know. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. Hi. 
 Uh... (Lowered voice) Traci, follow my lead. 
 (Normal voice) Hi. Hi. Sorry. Um, my name's Candice. 
 I'm in town for a conference... 
 (Chuckles) A silly conference, really, on overwriting... 
 Insurance overwriting, new avenues. 
 Anyway, um, we were actually on a shuttle to the airport, and... 
 Well, she had to pee, so we got off at the last hotel stop, and I stupidly followed her, and then when we came back out, the shuttle was gone. 
 That's terrible. 
 I know. I know. All of our bags, purses, everything is gone. 
 I mean, it's a nightmare. I am living a nightmare right now. 
 Is there any way that we could get a ride? 
 Sorry. I'm already late. 
 Okay, but maybe just as far as you're going, you know. 
 Uh, we could squeeze in. 
 Look.... just grab a cab. 
 Wow. Thank you so much. That's really generous. 
 Okay. Take care. Good luck. 
 20 bucks. That's, like, 200 of your bottles. 
 Yeah, and you're also Candice the insurance overwriter. 
 Overwriter. Overwriter. Underwriter? 
 It's insurance underwriter, isn't it? 
 Pick your character and commit. 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 Is there another number we can reach your mother at? 
 (Sighs) She's probably at her boyfriend's. 
 Okay, so what's his number? 
 He doesn't have a phone. Can I wash my face now? 
 (Sighs) All right. Well, we left a message at your mom's house. 
 Does she check messages? 
 Nope. 
 Well, how are we supposed to get ahold of her then? 
 If you find out, let me know. 
 All right. Well, in the mean time... 
 (Papers rustling) 
 Can you tell me exactly what happened? 
 Look, I told you. They were robbers, bandits. 
 Whatever. I just... I want to get my coat, and I want to go home. 
 It's okay. You know what, pal? 
 (Coughs) You don't have to say a thing. 
 (Beeps, shutter clicks) 
 So you're a liar. Did you get that? 
 Yep. 
 Hey. (Beep, click) Now what else we got here? 
 "Dip stick." That's original. 
 (Beep) 
 Turn to the left. You know a girl named Sarah? (Click) 
 Sarah wasn't there. 
 Actually you're probably right. "Touch Sarah and die." 
 That's probably Sarah's brother... 
 (Chuckles) or Sarah's boyfriend, maybe? 
 Can I, uh, talk to you guys? 
 Yeah. 
 (Lowered voice) So I found him on a social networking site. 
 Someone just posted a hate page about him. 
 The administrators are two teenagers from his high school... Cooper Well and Sarah Jones. 
 Okay. Good work.

 Young and eager, really wants to climb that competitive insurance ladder. (Chuckles)

 Pool.

 Sarah and Cooper's mom and Dad agreed to this little sit-down, so we could figure out who tied up our boy here. 
 Sarah saw him staring into her bedroom window. 
 I was so creeped out. 
 Then he stole a bracelet off of our teacher's desk and put it in my locker. I almost got expelled. 
 I wasn't trying to get you in trouble. 
 I just wanted to give you something. 
 So this was payback?

 They'll call the cops. Obviously, I don't like cops. 
 Okay, so you're just gonna let her die?

 Aw, man. I can't believe this.

 What? 
 A brick. That Cooper kid? He's in the hospital with serious injuries. That's some great advice, man. 
 I just wanted Finton to press charges. That's all I meant. 
 You laid it on thick for that kid because it made you feel like a man who could stand up for himself, when really, you're just as scared as he is. It's a rookie move, man What'll happen to Finton? 
 You start a criminal record for a kid like that, you might as well say good-bye. 
 Got to make this right, buddy. 
 We did good. 
 She's gonna be okay. 
 Yeah, I hope so. 
 You coming? 
 I'll meet you back at the station.

 Yeah, must be what it's like to wait for your kids to come home by curfew. 
 Yeah. Well, might be the closest we ever get to knowing that. 
 Nah, I don't think it's the closest we'll get. 
 Think the universe has a plan? 
 For us? 
 Oh, yeah. It was undoubtedly fate that brought you into that bar tonight. 
 (Laughs) 
 Mm-hmm. Okay, I might remember you saying something about it, but I didn't know you were gonna be there. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I didn't. 
 I never thought I'd see anybody I knew at the Alpine Inn...

 Least of all, you. 
 My one chance to be whoever I want to be, and I choose Candice who works in insurance.

 Epstein appears to be the winner, by a large margin. 
 Not that it was a competition. Yep. 
 Pay up, losers. 
 You bet on me? 
 Yeah, you're, uh, you're a simple kid, Epstein. 
 A little Doubting Thomas in your ear, and you're gold. Thank you. 
 (Pats back) 
 How'd you do it? 
 I made friends with someone, got him to trust me, and then, when he wasn't paying attention, I stabbed him in the back. 
 Turns out I'm pretty good at it. 
 (Telephones ringing, indistinct conversations) 
 Chris? 
 Can I, uh, can I go home with you now? 
 No. 
 Come  on. 
 This is not like you. You... you forgive, you... you understand, you give second and third chances. 
 You love puppies and ice cream, and you have faith in people. 
 Yeah. (Sighs) 
 I just don't have faith in us. 
 Your hair's sticking up, has been all night. 
 I don't really care, Diaz. 
 Welcome to the doghouse. 
 We are not in the doghouse. 
 We're out in the cold, and it's over.

 Hey. 
 Look at you. 
 Heh. 
 If you want a coffee and a muffin, though, you got to get to the back of the line, officer. 
 No, thanks. 
 Well, I hope you're not here to arrest me, 'cause I'm a little busy right now. 
 No, no, no. No, uh, it's this kid. 
 I know this kid who might be in a bit of trouble. 
 I want to find some way to help keep him on the straight and narrow, and... 
 (Speaks indistinctly) 
 I was kind of hoping, if maybe he did some volunteer work for your project, the prosecutor might be more lenient. 
 Well, you know, I can always use a helping hand. 
 Good. Great... thank you. 
 You know, it takes a brave man to hang on to hope in this day and age. 
 Uh... you mind if I stick around for a bit? Help out? 
 I'd like that. You can start right here. 
 All right. Cool. Hey, guys.

 You're quiet. 
 I'm just tired, that's all. 
 Right. 
 You know, big night, a lot to process. 
 Sure, yeah. Running into Swarek like that... must have reinstated your belief that something's meant to happen with you guys. 
 Ah, I didn't really think about it. 
 Okay, stop lying. 
 What? 
 I can't believe you went back there. 
 (Sighs) Who said I went back there? 
 That is the dumbest thing you have ever done. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 What? I couldn't help it. 
 (Groans) 
 Andy, you have to promise me you're never going back there. 
 It's way too dangerous, you have no idea what kind of case he's in the middle of. 
 I know, I know. One time thing, Trac. 
 Was it good? 
 (Groans) Heavenly.
