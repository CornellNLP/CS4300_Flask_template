 All right, everybody. Load and make ready. 
 (clicking) Chamber a round. 
 This scenario is called shoot, don't shoot." 
 If your target looks like a bad guy, shoot it. 
 If it does not... Peck? 
 Don't shoot! That is right. 
 Are we ready? 
 (officers) yes, sir! 
 All right, let's make some good decisions. 
 The range is hot! 
 (Tegan and Sara) 
 ♪ no, I'm not ready ♪ 
♪ for a big, bad step in their direction ♪ 
♪ no, I'm not ready ♪ 
♪ for downtown trash and void collection ♪ 
 (Oliver) prove safe! Benches down. 
 ♪ cityscapes, cities change before they die ♪ 
♪ four blocks I should mention in a song ♪ 
 Let's take a look here. Nice shoot-- 
 Under controlled circumstances, that is. 
 But we all know that out there in real life, Things are never controlled. 
 They are unpredictable, wild. 
 So holster your guns. 
 Come on. Put 'em away! 
 Now drop and give me 15. What?! 
 You have 15 seconds. Do it! 
 ♪ ...And over it and over them ♪ 
♪ uh-oh, oh, no, uh-oh, oh, no ♪ 
 (Dov) he's just trying to mess us up! 
 Epstein, shut it. 
 Okay, everybody up! Load your clips. 
 (clicking) 
 Faster! Benches up! 
 (thud) 
 (shell casings clattering) 
 ♪ no, we're not ready for fair distribution ♪ 
 (Oliver) prove safe! 
 All right. 
 Epstein, you shot a man carrying a cell phone. 
 Probably he's going to sue. 
 You're gonna be working for him for the rest of your life. 
 Peck, Diaz, not bad. 
 Also not good. 
 (sighs) 
 Toughie Nash, you didn't shoot at all. I thought it was the mother. 
 (Oliver) oh, is it? 
 (Traci) no. 
 No, it isn't. It's a bad guy. 
 Where are you? I'm dead. 
 Nice. McNally, you got your bad guy. Congratulations. 
 But not before you shot him up like a piece of swiss cheese. 
 What does this mean, sir? 
 I mean, do we fail our recertification? 
 Well, what this means is, um, you're all still rookies. 
 (laughs) 
 ♪ I know you feel it, too ♪ 
♪ it all seems so untrue ♪ 
♪ when you get up and over it and over them ♪ 
 (sighs) I feel like my whole life Is like that shooting range. Collateral damage? 
 Yeah, except half the time I don't even know What my target is. 
 What did Oliver call it? Controlled situation. 
 Controlled circumstance. Yeah. 
 And, Dov, your circumstances with Edie Were anything but controlled last night. 
 Oh, please, please, please-- a little roommate respect here, Thank you very much. Thin walls? 
 We gotta nail up some egg cartons or something, Because-- oh, Dov. Dating a stripper. You're such a cop cliche. 
 Uh, don't you mean cop fantasy? Because, uh, Most men would kill to be in my position. 
 Or should I say positions? 
 Pfft. 
 Couldn't do it, man-- I mean, date a stripper. 
 Don't you ever feel weird? No. 
 Hey, how are things going with you and Jerry? Confusing. Baby, boyfriend, the job-- 
 Might as well throw 'em all in a blender. Look, could we not talk about this? 
 I mean, some of us are newly single. Would you grow a pair? 
 You know what, Gail? 
 This whole thing with your brother isn't my fault, And we have to work together, so... 
 So can't you be nice to me? 
 That's the pair you grew? 
 Whoo! Bravo. 
 Why am I the only one who's ever on time for parade? 
 Because your Dad flies you in on "Peck force one" 
 Every morning. 
 (laughs) are you coming? 
 Yeah, I'll meet you in there. 
 Callaghan, how's it goin'? 
 Never better. I hear you got a big day ahead of you. 
 I guess. It wasn't my call. 
 Things just happen to you, don't they, Sammy? 
 Tell me... 
 (clears throat) 
 You ever take responsibility for anything? 
 You take care, buddy. 
 (chuckles) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Do you need something? 
 No, just-- 
 I got a lot to do, unless this is work-related. 
 Well, we haven't even talked since you left, so I thought-- 
 I don't have time. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe later then. 
 Hey. 
 Have a good trip. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (man laughs) 
 Hey, McNally-- 
 (door closes) 
 (Frank) okay, listen up! 
 I'm looking for a word-- 
 A word to describe The rookie recertification this morning. 
 It's a 6-letter word. 
 Anyone, can you help me? Anyone? 
 Fiasco. 
 That's the word. 
 Fi-as-co. 
 (marker clatters) you get to carry a gun, but you gotta know how to use it-- 
 And prove it. 
 It's been five months since the Academy, And you neophytes still can't improvise. (whispers) neo-what? 
 McNally, you were the only rookie To be recertified... Barely, And as a reward, I'm sending you to Sudbury. 
 What, sir? 
 Sudbury. To transport a prisoner. By myself? 
 No. 
 Swarek, uh, brief your rookie. 
 End of shift, the rest of you have a date With the firing range. That's all. 
 Serve, protect and keep your eye on the target. Please! 
 You can't do it. 
 You can't go on a holi-date with Swarek, Not after what happened. I have to! Traci, he's my T.O., okay? 
 It's not a holi-date. It's an assignment. 
 Well, just get Frank to reassign you. Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna talk to my staff sergeant About my man problems. Mm. Yeah, okay. You're right. 
 I'm just gonna igre him. That's gonna work. Listen, listen, listen. 
 Why don't you just pretend that it never happened? 
 Pretend to be his friend. Oh, friend. Yeah. 
 (whispers) I can't be friends with Sam Swarek right now! 
 Um... Okay. Just--listen, you can do this, all right? (sighs) 
 Just forget the past And act like this thing with Swarek never happened. 
 You can do it. You can do it. 
 Great idea, Traci. 
 Thank you. 
 (whispers) yeah. 
 Noelle, 15's finest... 
 No. 
 Take McNally up to Sudbury for me. Hell, no. 
 Please. I'll do your paperwork. 
 Please. Please? 
 (laughs) oh, you are working the dimples. Yeah. 
 Wow. You must really want this. (laughs) I do. 
 I hate prisoner transports. Mnh-mnh. No. They're not that bad. 
 You're stuck in a car all day with a jailbird, And then you gotta buy 'em a hot dog just to shut 'em up. Williams, please, just do me this solid, please. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 I don't know what's going on with you and this rookie, But whatever it is, work it out. 
 You look like hell. What's up? 
 (lowered voice) I can't find my notes. 
 What? The basement double murder, The witness Swarek and McNally are picking up in Sudbury-- 
 That case, my case. Yeah. Yeah. 
 I have to testify first thing in the morning, And I can't find my notes. 
 What do you mean, that you can't find them? 
 (normal voice) my notebook from that day. 
 I-I don't know. I-I must've misplaced it. 
 Well, sometimes you just have to double-check. No, no. I checked. 
 I've been doing nothing but checking the last 24 hours. 
 I turned my office upside down. Still, there's nothing. 
 It's not--it's not there. It's just... (sighs) oh, Jerry, losing your notes is almost as bad As losing your gun. Yeah, I know, Traci. 
 It was during the time of my divorce, and I-- okay, what about the prosecutor's office? 
 I mean, don't they keep a-a dummy sheet, A copy of the notes? Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. 
 I'm gonna call the prosecutor's office. 
 I'm gonna admit that I totally screwed up, And I'm gonna look incompetent on the stand, And then I'm gonna watch as the murderer goes free. 
 Why don't I do that? Ohh, I don't feel good. Oh. All right. Okay. All right, all right. 
 Yeah, I just gotta drop these files off, and I'm-- did you bring the... Thing? 
 You look like hell. What's up? 
 Wh-- 
 (Sam) I knew I guy that used to do this impression. 
 He could do it like he was hanging, Like, uh, his neck was broken, you know? Like this. (laughs) (laughs) 
 Officer Swarek. McNally, you ready to go? 
 Uh, yeah, about that-- I just... See ya. 
 Yeah, is there a problem? No. 
 Good. Well, yeah, actually. 
 Yeah? Yeah, because I think we really need To lay some ground rules. I drive. You shut up. Sound good? 
 Look, I know the manual doesn't really cover Whatever our situation is, But I do think that if we just act polite, okay-- 
 Not fake polite, real polite-- and we act as friends, And--and share the driving,  Then this will go just fine. What are you saying? You want to be my friend? 
 (siren wailing) 
 Okay. I'll pretend you're Traci. You pretend I'm Oliver. 
 Okay. Get in. 
 I'm driving... 
 Friend. 
 (sighs) 
 (engine starts) 
 ... Sudbury-- 
 The big nickel. 
 I mean, that's what the town's known for, right? 
 A big nickel shaped like a... Big-- nickel. Yeah. Giant chump change. 
 We're going to pick up a prisoner Named Ray Donald Swann-- 
 Small-time drug dealer, witnessed a double murder. 
 We're bringing him in to testify. 
 So what, five hours there, five hours back? Not the way I drive. 
 (tires peal) 
 So this prisoner that we're picking up at Sudbury jail... 
 Ray Donald Swann. 
 Yeah, what's history? Found in a basement apartment With a half kilo of coke and two dead dealers. 
 Dealers were shot in the face. 
 Must've ripped somebody off big-time. 
 Swann was there partying-- a no-no, 'cause he's on parole. 
 Swann was a bystander. He's lucky to be alive. 
 Oh, so we're just bringing him back To testify against the shooter. He was the only eyewitness. 
 He cut a deal. He's getting a year off his sentence. Oh, pfft. You know, I hate plea deals. 
 Happens all the time. I know, but, you know, it just doesn't make it right. 
 Just part of the dirtbag food chain. 
 What about Anton Hill? 
 All that work that you put in undercover. 
 You know, you'd be pissed if he got flipped For a lighter sentence. I never actually got Hill, remember? 
 So not really relevant. Yeah, but, you know-- 
 Try not to overthink it. 
 (scoffs) you compartmentalize a lot, don't you? 
 We're friends, so I'm gonna let that slide. 
 So this prisoner, Swann-- is he dangerous? 
 If he was, do you think they'd be sending you with me? 
 You know what? What? 
 I'm gonna let tt slide. 
 Are we done talking? Yes. 
 Good. 
 (Dov) what's wrong with you? Huh? 
 You break Chris's heart. You won't talk to him. 
 You know he's fragile. What do you care? 
 Who are you? 
 (slurps loudly) 
 Is it supposed to be a full moon tonight or what? 
 Why? Is it crazy out there? No, no, no, honey. Crazy does not begin to describe it. 
 You're not gonna believe what I just brought in. Well, try me. 
 All right. Got this call to a house on brock. 
 8-year-old boy is kicking a soccer ball Around his backyard... Mm-hmm. 
 Finds a male, fully naked, sleeping in the geraniums. Oh? 
 He runs inside. His mom calls it in, hysterical. Right. Welcome to the neighborhood. 
 Mm. Yeah, guy's wasted, right? 
 Mnh-mnh. No, no, no. See, this is the full moon part. 
 I shake hi he comes to. 
 He's lucid, but he says he can't remember his name. He have I.D.? 
 Nada. 
 Nada. A filthy, naked John Doe. That sounds like a job for... 
 (singsongy) Peck, Epstein! Peck-stein! 
 (chuckles) oh, I kinda like the sound of that, actually. Mm-hmm. 
 Uh, rookies, find our John Doe some clothes. 
 Little miss put-upon. What is going on over there? 
 Wow. 
 (door closes) hey. 
 Hey. Hey. Hi. 
 I feel so naked without my gun. 
 (chuckles) yeah. So--so what are you guys up to? Yeah. 
 Babysitting a John Doe for Noelle. Yeah, he says he's got amnesia. It's very soap opera. 
 Oh. Where are you guys headed? 
 Uh, interview room. 
 Sounds interesting. 
 (laughs) it's not. Yeah, most--most definitely not... Interesting. 
 So see ya. 
 (Chris) see ya. 
 Okay, so we gathered up all the information That might pertain to the double murder. We'll go through all the witness statements, All the evidence. Yeah, we'll help you remember. 
 I have to testify in less than 4 hours, And it isn't just about the facts. 
 I gotta bring them into the room-- 
 You know, the way bodies were laid out In relation to the door, how many windows there were, How the room smelled, how the light came-- you gotta testify about the way the room smelled? 
 Yeah, sure, if asked. There is a killer on trial, And if I look at all unsure about what happened, He might walk. Okay, well, let's-- let's put it all together. 
 Just--you put us in the room. Yeah, we'll do whatever it takes. 
 Okay, great. Take this. Go through that. Okay. Sure. 
 All right. Okay. You take that and go through that. Okay. 
 Hey, what kind of music Do you like listening to when you drive? 
 Nothing. I like to be alone with my thoughts. 
 Hmm. What thoughts? 
 My own private thoughts. 
 Okay, like, what's one of them? Are you allergic to silence? 
 (laughs) what are you talking about? 
 I'm silent all the time. Good. 
 I know what you're doing, okay. 
 Who can stay quiet the longest? 
 I don't think so. 
 (clears throat) come on. What kind of music do you like listening to? 
 Rush. I'm a big rush fan. Who? 
 Yeah, I like the who. 
 Classic rock, you know. 
 All right, scan around. 
 Find me some free. 
 Free? 
 (static) 
 (radio frequencies tuning) 
 Give me that. 
 Oh. Well, I... 
 Okay. 
 Wh-whoa! Okay. 
 Mr. Doe, uh, any luck, uh, remembering that name? 
 No, sir. Nothing. 
 Uh, how about an address? 
 Wish I could help ya. 
 Date of birth? 
 Okay, we're--we're obliged to contact mapleview mental health, So, I mean, maybe they can help you out. 
 Wh-what's he doing? 
 I try not task. Officer Epstein? 
 Don't worry, Mr. Doe. 
 We're gonna figure out who you are. 
 Follow me, buddy. Let's roll. 
 You hungry? 
 Yes, definitely. 
 You care where? 
 No, no. I'm easy. 
 Diner it is. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Okay, this is really awkward. 
 Are we not gonna talk at all? 
 You wanna talk? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Let's talk about the job we're on. 
 There's some basic rules for picking up a prisoner. All right. 
 (clears throat) don't get too cozy with 'em. 
 Always assume the body is dangerous. 
 And treat him the same as he treats you. 
 Great. 
 Well, I mean, at least the drive is pretty-- 
 The leaves and--and the colors of the... 
 Leaves and stuff. 
 You know, you're the one who's making this awkward. 
 I'm doing everything I can just to make this feel Even a little bit normal. 
 (silverware clatters) 
 You know what? You're stubborn. 
 Forget it. I give up. I quit. 
 It's not like it can get more awkward anyway. 
 Miss! Miss. 
 Problem here, officer? 
 There's a problem with my b.L.T. Really? 
 Yeah, I think you better call a ham-bulance. 
 Can I get you anything else? 
 Well, my partner here was wondering  If you have any hen-ways on the menu? What's a hen-way? 
 About 3 pounds. 
 (laughing) 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're such an idiot. 
 But still feeling awkward? 
 I gotta say, I did not expect ham-bulance From someone like you. 
 Someone like me? 
 Yeah. You're just so serious all the time. 
 See? I hate that. 
 What? 
 "why is Sam always so serious?" 
 I've been getting that my whole life. 
 When I was in third grade, I went out and bought the biggest joke book on earth. (laughs) yeah, obviously memorized it. 
 All 101 jokes. 
 (laughs) 
 Couldn't even make my own sister laugh. 
 You got a sister? 
 Yeah, Sarah. She lives in st. Catherine's. 
 Oh. 
 Well, it was a long time ago, So maybe you just need a new joke book. 
 (dog barking in distance) 
 (Sam sighs) 
 I've never done this before-- transport a prisoner. 
 I've never been friends with a woman before. 
 (laughs) well, they sent me, so how bad can it be? 
 Let's go find out. 
 
 
 
 (door creaks) 
 You know, for a guy with his sheet, he's not too bad. 
 He's polite at least. 
 Good to know. Thanks, brother. 
 Yeah, no problem, man. Good luck. 
 Mr. Swann, I'm officer McNally. This is officer Swarek. Hey. 
 (handcuffs clicking) we're gonna be escorting you to the prosecutor's office. 
 Turn around. 
 Friends call me Ray. 
 We're not your friends. 
 Not yet. 
 See ya, Ray. 
 (Ray) see you later. 
 (clank) 
 Hey, thanks a lot for letting me have the cuffs up front. 
 Appreciate that. 
 Yeah, no problem. It's a long ride. 
 No, no, really. It was a nice thing to do. 
 So, uh, how long have you been a cop there, Officer Mc... Hat? What was it? McNally. 
 Oh, yeah. Um... Well, not too long. 
 You like it? Yeah, some days. 
 I guess it's like any job, huh? Yeah. 
 Got its ups and downs. Yeah? What do you know about having a job? 
 Oh, hey, man, before I got picked up, I was apprenticing for a tool and die maker. 
 I was trying to put the past behind me. 
 Guess you could say we're both newbies. 
 That's enough talking, McNally. Huh? Oh. 
 (whispers) sorry. Didn't mean to get you in trouble there. 
 We're not allowed to talk. 
 (normal voice) that's the way you roll, right, chief? 
 Strong, silent type. I can tell. 
 Like to build up a mystique, keep those ladies thinking There's a lot more going on behind those smoldering eyes Than there really is, huh? 
 (laughs) how am I doing, officer McNally? 
 Right on the money, I bet. 
 No offense, man,  But, you know, th-there are other ways to deal with people. 
 I don't mean to be a jerk. 
 It's just that... You know, every moment offers you The opportunity to find out something new about yourself. 
 The buddhists, you know, they call it a beginner's mind." 
 Ah, see? I see that skeptical look there, John Wayne. 
 But a beginner-- they see all possibilities. 
 An expert--few. 
 You should be proud and happy that you're a beginner. 
 Why don't we all begin to shut up? 
 Ray Swann was in the corner in cuffs. 
 We had two bodies on the ground, multiple gunshot wounds. 
 There was cocaine on the table. Oh, no. Hold on. No, it wasn't-- 
 It--we're--uh... It--it was on the dresser. 
 And then... Um... 
 What? 
 Come on. 
 Whoa. Uh, sorry, but, uh, I'm using this room. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Come on. 
 Okay. Uh... 
 I came in. 
 Okay. 
 Followed by detective Callaghan. 
 Okay, so... It's a basement apartment, So should I duck? Sure. Whatever. That'd be great. 
 Okay. 
 (imitating Luke) Jerry. (imitating Jerry) Luke, hey, brother. 
 This looks like a double homicide. Double trouble. 
 Yeah. Okay, stop. Uh... 
 I wouldn't say something like that. 
 (normal voice) you totally would. But I didn't. 
 What did you say? 
 You know what? This isn't, uh, gonna work for me. 
 Am I not convincing enough? I thought I was-- Jerry, wh-what are we missing? 
 I don'know! That's the point. 
 Fine. Okay. 
 I'm just gonna go through all the evidence again, And I'll be in the squad room, trying to help you. 
 (door opens) 
 So should I take it from the top? (door closes) 
 No. 
 Oh. 
 I don't see any photo I.D. or fingerprint matches. 
 No missing person reports. 
 How can someone just not exist like this? It's insane. Yeah. Whatever. 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 Don't let my real police work get in the way With, uh, whatever it is you're doing. You know, I'm actually doing my work. 
 I'm filling out paperwork, And I'm admitting this guy to mapleview. 
 And in two hours, he's their problem. 
 Roger that. 
 I'm gonna see if I can get any hits on the description. 
 Would you say his eyes are brown or hazel? Dov, this is an E.D.P. call. 
 I mean, if he is faking it, he's pathological. 
 If he actually has amnesia, that's a mental health issue. 
 It's not our problem. How can you not be excited about this? 
 I mean, this is a mystery. We're cops. We solve mysteries. No, we don't. 
 We serve, protect and hopefully get our frickin' guns back. 
 Just trying to seize the day here. 
 Unlike you, if I want to make detective, I'm gonna have to actually work for a living. 
 Why do men always wait until the last minute To fill up with gas? It wasn't the last minute. 
 Yeah, it was empty. 
 We would've been running on fumes the rest of the way home. Needle on empty means a quarter tank. 
 No one asked you. Empty means empty. 
 It's a good thing we're friends, Because this would be a major bone of contention Between us. You guys aren't friends. 
 Yeah, we are. Oh, come on. Look, you got nothing in common. 
 Then there's the power dynamic, right? 
 I mean, you gotta boss her around all the time. 
 You're running around trying to please him at every turn. 
 (laughs) no, I'm not. Ah, he's got a lot of expectations. 
 You kinda feel like you owe him something, don't ya? 
 Well, let me tell ya. Friends--they don't owe. 
 They do 'cause they want to do. 
 If I buy you a hot dog, will you shut up? 
 Put mustard on it? Please? 
 He just likes silence. 
 Hey, how long you guys been sleeping together? 
 What? No, we're not. 
 No, we're friends. 
 I just... 
 I'm gonna pay for the gas. 
 Why didn't you just go at the gas station? 
 Because the men's room is out of order. 
 Okay, so then go in the women's. 
 Skulking out of the ladies' room. 
 All right. I'll be back in two minutes. (sighs) 
 Don't talk to the prisoner. Don't get out of the car. 
 Don't do anything. All right? 
 (grunting) 
 (gulping and gasping) 
 (voice straining) was there peanut oil in the hot dog? Why, are you allergic? 
 Okay, there's an epi in the medikit. Just hold on. 
 (thud) 
 (grunts) 
 (gasps) 
 I screwed up. Yeah, you lost the prisoner! Okay, we gotta get him back now! 
 (scoffs) I didn't think he would try anything like that. 
 Yeah, clearly! You know, you've been talking to him all morning Like he's your best friend! Since we got in that car, You've been more interested in making friends Than getting this job done right! Look, you told me to treat him like he treats me. I did. 
 This isn't a tea party with your freakin' dolls, McNally! 
 And you don't open the door when the prisoner's feet  Are facing you. That you should know! 
 You overthink every little thing, But when something matters, you don't think at all. 
 Well, we've got to call for backup. Yeah, and tell 'em what? 
 We lost the prisoner 'cause he was choking on a hot dog? 
 Besides, it'll be two hours before they get here. 
 It'll be dark. He'll be gone. Okay, I'm sorry. 
 If we don't get this guy back before nightfall, we're screwed. 
 Well, then let's go. 
 (birds chirping) 
 Maybe you should just come clean. 
 You know, tell the prosecutor you lost your notes or-- 
 Or not. 
 So? 
 I mean, don't you rember seeing it? 
 When would I have seen it? Um, maybe last weekend. 
 Are you blaming this on the fact that Leo and I stayed at your place? I don't know. Is it a coincidence That the first time you guys stay over, Your son draws on my freshly painted living room walls And my notebook goes missing? Jerry, I don't think that's the reason Your notes are missing. I mean, friggin' Leo might be using my notes As a coloring book as we speak. Excuse me! "friggin' Leo"? 
 Uh, uh, I could just go. Oh, come on, Traci. You gotta admit, The kid doesn't exactly pick up after himself, right? He's 6. 
 Okay, he's 6. 
 (sighs deeply) 
 You know, it's just, when we were married, My wife took care of these things and... 
 (door closes) 
 I think I might've played that one a little differently. 
 You know what, Diaz? You're right. 
 I'm gonna call the prosecutor. (beeping) 
 (birds chirping) 
 He went that way. 
 No, don't touch that! It's poison oak. 
 Wow, haven't spent much time in the country, have you? 
 I don't own fishing cabin, if that's what you mean. 
 I'm a city boy, McNally. 
 I can fix your car blindfolded and cuffed. 
 Would you care to participate in this little manhunt? 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) wait, wait, wait. 
 W-wait a second. What? 
 Ugh. 
 Are those Swann's handcuffs? 
 (click) no, McNally. They fell off a freakin' beaver. 
 Call the ham-bulance. 
 (sighs) 
 We're wandering around in the forest Like a couple of morons. This is--this is a nightmare. 
 It's getting dark. 
 We've got an hour left of decent daylight. 
 (panting) Sam, what if we don't find him? 
 We'll find him. What if we don't? 
 I don't know. 
 You'll get thrown under a bus, I'll get thrown behind a desk. 
 (branch snaps) 
 (mouths words) (lowered voice) what was that? 
 (grunts) oh! 
 Sorry, sorry! 
 (whispers) sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 (panting) 
 Okay, home. Now don't think. 
 What's the first thing that pops into your head? Family. 
 Family? That's great. 
 Uh, what does this family look like? Don't--don't think. 
 Uh, there's a man and a woman and, uh, some children, Maybe a dog, and they love each other-- 
 Okay, I told you he was faking it. That-- 
 Mr. Doe, that's not a real family. We'll try again. 
 Uh, occupation. Don't think. 
 Job. Job. Can you be more specific? 
 Can you give me your hand? 
 I'm not gonna bite it. 
 Yeah, they're rough. He uses these. All right. 
 Blue collar guy with a nice family. 
 Sounds pretty good to me. Sign me up. Yeah. Oh, more good news. 
 I ran your prints, and from what we can tell, You don't have a criminal record. Really? 
 Does that surprise you? Well, you gotta wonder about a guy Who winds up naked in a flower bed. Okay, Mr. Doe, I ve finished your paperwork So you can go with the people from mapleview now. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Excuse me. 
 What are you doing? We're not done here yet. 
 We still have more Word association exercises to do. I really appreciate your efforts, officer, But I-I don't think--I don't think we're gonna get there. 
 Okay. Um... 
 I'll, uh... I'll keep running identity searches, and, uh-- 
 But don't think I'm gonna forget about you. 
 Well, if I do figure out who I am, I hope I'm as good a guy as you are. 
 But, hey, maybe that's why Nobody's filed any missing persons report. 
 Maybe nobody wants to find me. I could be a real jerk, right? 
 Maybe's a blessing not be who ever I was. 
 Right? 
 Wow. You take such detailed notes. 
 You have to. 
 You know, the first time I testified... 
 (grunts) 
 I got in the box, and right as I started talking, I realized that I forgot to put the accused's name in my notes. 
 No way. Yeah, I couldn't lie about it, either. 
 Your notes are your notes. 
 You don't get to rewrite history. 
 Uh... 
 Detective Barber? 
 Hmm? 
 The guy you arrested for the murders-- 
 His prints were on the gun, right? 
 Yeah. Otherwise, we wouldn't have made the case. 
 Well, it's just that... 
 The numbers on these I.D.E.N.T. forms are different. 
 What? 
 (papers rustle) 
 Here at the top corner, uh, These catalogue numbers should match, right? 
 Because they're copies. 
 But the last two numbers are different. Yeah, you're right. I.D.E.N.T. mislabeled it. 
 Oh, no. What? 
 Ray Swann had a weapon, but he didn't fire it. (beeping) 
 The I.D.E.N.T. report should've had Ray Swann's prints On the murder weapon. The--the witness is the shooter? 
 He's our killer. Come on, Sammy, pick up. 
 (birds chirping) 
 (branch creaks) 
 That's gotta be him. 
 He's trying to wait us out. 
 (sighs) once it gets dark, he's home free. 
 We gotta flush him out. 
 What do you want me to do? What you do best, McNally-- 
 Okay. Wait. Uh, what is that, exactly? Talk. 
 Your mouth is your best weapon. 
 A good copper should be able To talk themselves out of 98% of all confrontations. 
 What about the other 2%? Th's what I'm here for. 
 Hey, Ray! 
 I know you can hear me! 
 You know you don't have a chance Of getting out of these woods, right? 
 I mean, k-9 and s.W.A.T. Are already on their way! 
 You have a plea deal. 
 Okay, the second they get here, that's gone. 
 You're going back to jail. 
 So let's just call them off, Ray, seriously. 
 Come out now! 
 We'll just forget this whole thing! 
 (panting) 
 Sam! 
 (footsteps rapidly approach) 
 (grunting) 
 (thudding) 
 (grunts) no! (gasps) 
 Where's your partner? 
 (panting) 
 (grunting) where are those dogs? 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 Shh. 
 (muffled grunts) 
 I'm just gonna squeeze, squeeze, and you're gonna pass out. 
 (whimpering) 
 (whispers) it's okay. Shh. 
 It's okay. 
 And then I'm gonna get your gun, and you're not. (muffled cries) 
 (grunting) 
 Uhh! 
 (gasping loudly) 
 (groans) aw, man. Oh! Okay, okay. 
 Okay, okay. Aah, my shoulder! 
 (panting) 
 You okay? 
 Right as rain. How you doing? 
 You're breaking my shoulder, man. You're breaking my heart, buddy. 
 (groaning) come on! I want a lawyer. 
 Yeah, we'll get right on that. (handcuffs clicking) 
 Oh, man, your knee! 
 Okay, so Frank's letting us do the recert end of shift, So chunk up, little man. 
 Come on, are you still weepy about Mr. Nobody? 
 Wow. You really are that cold. 
 Oh, right, and you're the big-hearted ambassador Of goodwill, aren't you? You're such a hypocrite. 
 Hypocrite? 
 Yeah. A stranger walks in off the street. 
 I work my butt off to be a nice guy And try to figure out who he is. 
 But not something I'd expect you to understand. Get what? 
 No, what, that it might be nice to have a different past So nobody could hold it against you? 
 So maybe your so-called friends could see you as a fellow cop And not some white shirt waiting to happen? 
 (voice breaks) yeah, Dov, I really can't imagine that. 
 (inhales sharply) 
 Sorry. It's okay. 
 I cannot wait to get back to civilization. You haven't done a lot of camping, huh? 
 What, you mean like with a tent? 
 Yeah, my Dad used to take me every summer. 
 Told you, I'm more of a city boy. 
 In the summers, my sister and I used to go to day camp-- 
 Parks and rec. 
 Did try to go to the beach this one time. 
 We were on a bus About a half an hour out of town, and... 
 Sarah kind of freaked out. 
 What, was she afraid of the water? She was afraid of... Uh, everything. 
 When she was 13, Sarah was attacked by this group of guys. 
 Yeah, pretty messed up by it. I was only 9 at the time. 
 (tape tearing) I didn't really get it. 
 Tried everything to cheer her up. 
 Hence, the joke book. 
 Yeah. 
 Nothing really worked. 
 You were 9 years old. 
 I'm sure you did everything you could. 
 She didn't, uh, need cheering up. 
 She just needed someone to protect her. 
 So you became a cop. 
 Your leg's good to go. 
 You want to try putting some weight on it? Yeah. 
 It's great. Thank you. 
 I'm really sorry for freaking out on you. 
 Hmm. 
 Look... 
 Whatever happened... 
 Between us... 
 Uh... 
 You know, Luke's a good guy. 
 He's reliable, solid. 
 He is. Yep. And a hell of a detective. 
 Doesn't impose, doesn't judge, just looks at the facts. 
 Which is probably what he's doing right now. 
 St give him some time. 
 (whispers) yeah. 
 Good to go? 
 Yeah, as long as you drive. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Detective Barber, This is Ray Donald Swann. 
 (shackles clinking) 
 He's a snake in the grass, and he's, uh, all yours. 
 Hello, Raymond. 
 You're under arrest for the murder Of Mark Daniels and Carl Damaso. Let's go. (door slams) 
 (door buzzes, beeps) 
 (sighs deeply) 
 See you around, pal. 
 See you around, buddy. 
 (chuckles) 
 (door buzzes, beeps) 
 Have a good trip? 
 You know what? You're an idiot. 
 Excuse me? 
 Nothing happened with McNally that night. 
 I tried. She shot me down. 
 She's crazy about you. Don't screw it up. 
 (door closes) 
 (indistinct conversations, telephone ringing) 
 I see you swallowed your pride, called the prosecutor. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, but now that we got another potential shooter, It changes everything. I'm gonna be up all night. 
 I don't even know what my testimony's gonna be yet. Jerry, I'm not your wife. 
 What am I to you? 
 (lowered voice) Traci, I-I really can't talk about this right now. 
 Talk about it. 
 The ink on my divorce isn't even dry yet. 
 Okay, this--this... 
 This is all new to me. 
 Okay, well, you know what? 
 I'm gonna go shoot. 
 Okay. 
 We're due at the firing range. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 Look, I'm trying to-- skip it.

 Um, if we've--if I've-- 
 It's fine. Judged you--
