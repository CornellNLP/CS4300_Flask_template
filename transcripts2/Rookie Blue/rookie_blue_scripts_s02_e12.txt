 What are you doing? 
 Putting on my shirt. 
 I wouldn't have made you for shy. 
 I'm not being shy. I'm just... you know... 
 Wire's off. Camera's off, Andy. 
 Prove it. 
 Happy? 
 Very. 
 Grapefruit or cranberry? 
 Orange. 
 Grapefruit. 
 I'm never doing this again. 
 I think you said that the last time. 
 You're the one that called me. 
 I don't even have your number. 
 Too risky, all right? The less you know about what I'm doing, the better. 
 I don't even know anything. 
 I mean, other than the fact that you hang out in dive bars and flash cash, make friends with Jamie Brennan. 
 That guy is no joke. 
 Forget you ever met that guy. 
 Okay. 
 I don't need to know anything. 
 You know, unlike Sam, J.D. Is a perfect gentleman. 
 Brings me juice to bed... 
 Holds my hand, and he actually calls me. 
 Well, J.D.'s an open book. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 What do you wanna know? 
 Favorite ice cream. 
 What? 
 What? 
 That's your first question? 
 I'm a badass drug smuggler, and that's what you wanna know? 
 What? Everybody likes ice cream. Everyone has a favorite. 
 Okay, pistachio. 
 Except for that. 
 No. 
 No one chooses pistachio. 
 Yes. 
 No, ever. 
 J.D. Was 6 years old. He went to visit his father in Maplehurst Penitentiary. 
 It was the first time he ever met the guy, so he was a little nervous. 
 But when he got in there, his Dad gave him a pint of pistachio ice cream. 
 They ate it together, and he wasn't so nervous anymore. 
 Rookie Blue S02E12 "On The Double" 
 -=Original airdate: September 8, 2011 =- 
 You, uh, you all right? 
 Fine. 
 And does your physio know you're lifting this much weight? 
 I mean, you're supposed to be strengthening your back, not injuring it again. 
 I'm sorry, man. It was my bad. I should've had that. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Wicked plan, though. 
 W-what do you mean? 
 Give your buddy faulty barbells, weight slips, bam. Ex-buddy killed instantly. 
 W-wait. You-- you know I would never... 
 I'm kidding. 
 I mean, you gotta know. 
 It's a bad joke. I'm sorry. 
 Look, Chris, I really screwed things up with Gail. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Now, don't-- Look, it is what it is. 
 Okay? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Feels good to be back to normal. 
 Got that right, brother. 
 "Brother"? 
 You sound just like Oliver. 
 Next thing I know, you're gonna be asking me to buy you lunch. 
 Nice! If I want your opinion, Diaz, I'll ask for it. 
 Now go get me a sandwich. No pickles! 
 All right. Okay, I got one. 
 You wanna know the rules, go ask your mother, 'cause I don't play by the rules. 
 Swarek? 
 Yeah! 
 I-it was good. It was good. 
 Okay, I got-- I got another one. I got another one. Okay. 
 Are you sucking up to me, Peck? 
 'Cause I don't mind, just long as you know it's not gonna get you anywhere... 
 With... me. 
 That's not how you do Noelle. Noelle is more like, uh... 
 Are you sucking up to me, Peck? 'Cause that is not gonna get you Jack. 
 Just, uh, getting my gym bag. 
 Looks like she's been living out of that gym bag. 
 Yeah, I didn't even know she had a gym bag, actually. 
 All right. 
 Ella Jane Tulip is a bitch. 
 Well, with a name like that... 
 Who is she? A prostitute? Junkie? 
 Leo's classmate. 
 What, you're mad at a second grader? 
 That was Leo's teacher on the phone, and my son is refusing to go to school because this Tulip girl's been picking on him. 
 Trace, kids pick on each other. It's the circle of life. 
 Derek McKinley called me "Jerry Barbie" until I was in high school. 
 What, you want me to send a couple guys over there, rough her up? 
 It's tempting, but no. 
 I already told Leo that fighting back is not the answer. 
 There is good in everyone. You just have to find it. 
 So you lied to him. 
 Trace, one thing that I've learned in this job is to expect the worst out of everyone, and if I'm wrong, great. 
 But some people-- a lot of people-- are just plain bad. 
 I choose to believe in the fundamental goodness of human nature. 
 You called a 7-year-old a bitch. 
 In a moment of weakness, and I feel better. Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 You, uh, working the afternoon shift? 
 No, I already told you. 
 I took the day off to finalize my mortgage. 
 Right, right, right, right. 
 So, uh, which one did you buy? 
 You know the one on the corner with all the windows? 
 I actually showed Sam all the pictures before he disappeared. 
 I remember. It's beautiful. 
 Thanks. You wanna come? 
 I wish I could, but, uh, I gotta turn these cameras back on and start behaving. 
 Another eight hours without a wire, and Boyd might actually notice. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna miss you. 
 How long's it gonna be? 
 Yeah? 
 It's Brennan. I brought coffee. 
 J.D., come on. Open the door. 
 What? 
 Coffee's getting cold. Open up. 
 What? 
 So... how are things? 
 What, like you don't know every single detail? 
 I'm not sure I wanna know every detail. 
 I'm just asking how things are, since, you know, you and Chris-- 
 Why does everyone care so much? 
 You're lucky your life is so quaint. 
 Quaint? 
 Stable, solid, not worth gossiping about. 
 No offense. 
 Why would I take offense, Gail? 
 Home invasion in progress. 193 Dowling. Suspect is still on scene. 
 Car 1504 responding. We're on it. 
 Calm down. What happened? 
 I heard gunshots in the apartment right above me. It's apartment 202. 
 Stay there. Stay here. 
 1504 on scene at 193 Dowiwng. Going in. 
 Copy that. 
 This is the police! We know you're in here. Identify yourself. 
 Police! Don't move! 
 Please don't shoot! I'll do anything you want! Just don't kill me. 
 Nothing. 
 Okay, I'm gonna check the other room. 
 I'll--I'll do anything you say. Just don't shoot me. 
 You don't have to keep saying that, okay? We're not gonna shoot you. 
 Come on. 
 Place is clear, but we have a body in the upstairs apartment. 
 Oh my God. Kevin. She-- she killed him. 
 Who killed him? 
 One of you guys-- a cop. 
 A police officer? Are you sure? 
 Her-- her name tag was right here. 
 What was her name? 
 Peck. Her name was Peck. 
 What? 
 So our witness says he ran through here, then jumped to the unit below? 
 All right. 
 Single bullet wound straight through the heart. 
 Looks amateur to me. Look how many times the shooter missed. 
 I thought you were a better shot than that, Peck. 
 Well, what do you know? Kevin Reynolds. Dealer with a bad attitude. 
 Guys in 27 liked him for a drive-by last year but couldn't make it stick. 
 Nash, you run this down to the car. Put it through the CPIC. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Now this blood over here-- that's not his. It's too far away from the body. 
 Well, the other guy-- the scaredy-cat witness-- he didn't have a scratch on him, Luke. 
 Okay, well, maybe the, uh, shooter got hit in the exchange. 
 Guys, can we get a piece of this? 
 Yeah. 
 Take it down to the lab. 
 See if our "Officer Peck" is in the system. 
 You know I didn't have anything to do with this. 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fairly convinced. 
 Good. 
 Yeah, but, you know, the thing I really wanna know is why someone's running around in your uniform shooting drug dealers. 
 Nice place. 
 Thanks. 
 "Moby Dick." Impressive. 
 Not really. Helps put me to sleep. 
 Yeah, you know what's funny? I've got that same lamp. 
 Is that why you're here, boss-- to compare home furnishings? 
 No, I'm here to make it clear that nobody does business out of my warehouse without talking to me first. 
 Okay. 
 I'm serious. 
 Guys say you can get practically anything you want. 
 I'm wondering how exactly that happens. 
 "God's good grace." 
 What does that mean? 
 That's the name of my boat. 
 It's docked at the Harbourfront. 
 Why? You, uh, want in on anything? Just let me know. 
 Thank you. I was in. 
 That didn't turn out so well. 
 How do you mean? 
 Long story. 
 I got time. 
 Look, you probably know the gist of it. 
 Okay, humor me. 
 What have the guys told you? 
 They say you're a fair boss. They say you've had a rough year. 
 Tell you about my, uh, wife? My little girl? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry. 
 You wanna grab, uh, something to eat? 
 I got nothing here, but there's a half-decent diner around the corner. 
 Nah. I'm good. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Wouldn't wanna intrude. 
 So.. when are you gonna let me meet her? 
 Did you get us coffee, babe? 
 Candice? 
 Jamie, right? 
 Yeah, we met the other night at the bar. 
 You remember. I'm touched. 
 I mean, kicked my ass in pool. How could I forget? 
 To Candice. Thanks to you, boss. 
 There's an armed killer on the loose, wearing an official police uniform-- uniform that belongs to an officer in this division-- my division. 
 Yes, sir. 
 How? 
 I believe the uniform was stolen from my car last night. 
 You of all people should know not to leave your uniform in the car in clear view. 
 If I had known, I would have reported it right away. 
 I forgot it was in my car. 
 You have three uniforms, Peck. How hard is it to keep track of three uniforms? 
 Yeah. I-I thought one was in the dry cleaner's and the other one was at a place I used to live, and I-I knew that for sure that this was in my locker, so-- 
 Stop! There is no excuse for this. You understand me? 
 Officer Nash. 
 Detective. What's this? 
 This is Kevin Reynolds' cell phone. We have to find someone to notify. 
 Don't you have a file on him? 
 Yeah, we have a long file on him. 
 Just, nothing in the system about a next of kin, so, uh, I'd start with the speed dial. 
 Hey, vigilante mama. 
 Officer Peck, I got a guy, uh, double-parked over here on Carlton. 
 Can you go issue him a ticket, with extreme prejudice? 
 Yeah. 
 Peck, you got a minute? 
 Can it wait? I'm just on my way to go murder somebody. 
 I just have some questions. 
 This is from the one camera in the lobby that actually works. 
 Yeah, I've never seen her before. 
 You didn't notice anybody hanging around your car last night? 
 No, the street was completely empty. 
 All right, where were you coming from? 
 Why? 
 Someone may have followed you, targeted you-- somebody who knew you were a cop. 
 No one was targeting me. I was alone. I was just, you know, visiting someone. 
 Private dwelling on Hinsgton Street. 
 All right, then. Address. 
 333 Hingston Street. 
 Celeste, the all-night psychic? 
 What, you know her? 
 Yeah, we used her on a missing persons case last year. 
 You know, she's not very good. 
 Yeah. 
 No kidding. I... I think she put a curse on me. I just, I... 
 How tall are you? 
 5'7". 
 And weight. 
 120. 
 Suspect we're looking for was wearing your uniform, so-- 
 Fine. 130. 
 I just couldn't get on the plane. 
 I tried to leave, and I ended up missing the plane, and I stayed. 
 Glad you did. Woman like you doesn't knock on my door every day. 
 True. 
 You probably think we're crazy. 
 No, I get it. Sometimes you just know. 
 Excuse the interruption. You two have fun today. I gotta go. 
 Okay. See ya. 
 Thanks for dropping by, boss. 
 Yeah, we'll talk later. 
 Okay, this is really bad, okay? I gotta get outta here. I gotta go! 
 Not for another 15 minutes, Okay? 
 15 minutes? Why? 
 Because we have to make sure he's gone. Do you understand? 
 Are you sure 15 minutes is even enough, huh? 
 Maybe 20. 
 What? 
 Okay, ma'am. Thank you very much. 
 I don't have any guns on me. Nothing. Multiple gunshots... One dead body... Some guy jumps out of a window, and no witnesses? Basic survival instinct. People keep to themselves. Nobody talks. Well, Gail says there's a witness on this floor. He was on the stairwell when they arrived on the scene. It's a good thing she was on patrol when it happened. Why? Perfect alibi. Well, nobody would actually think Gail would be capable of murderer Well,"nice" wasn't actually her strong suit. "Mean," on the other hand... I've never met someone who could dish it out like Gail Peck. She is kinda awesome. Jonathan Gupta. G-u-p-t-a. I heard a commotion and peeked down the stairs to see what was the matter. Then I heard the gunshots. A moment later, I saw the lady officer running away. I hope she is okay. I want to thank you for trying to rid this building of all these drug-dealing bastards. Well, actually, that first officer-- So sorry you were only able to shoot one of them. Actually, that first officer wasn't-- Sir, did you say all those drug-dealing bastards"? Well, you shot Kevin, right? Well, not us, exactly. And Carson threw himself through the window-- not to his death, unfortunately. But you did arrest him, yes? Well, that leaves Danny. Who's Danny? I don't know his last name. He lives in one of the town houses across from the park-- used to be a nice kid. Now he's a drug-dealing b*st*rd like the others. Did you see Danny this morning? No, I didn't. But you will let me know if you manage to track him down and shoot him, yes? Anything else I can do for you? Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 
 Do you know this person? Yeah, she's the cop who tried to kill me this morning. Cop impersonator. Yeah, whatever. We have reason to believe there was somebody else in the apartment-- another dealer named Danny working for you and Kevin Reynolds. I don't know what you're talking about. You got nothing on me. Actually, we've got you breaking into the apartment downstairs. I told you. The cop came in. Yeah. She pulled out a gun. I... ran. That's it. We know the shooter is the approximate height and weight of this fine officer behind you, so anything you can give us-- ethnicity, hair color, eye color--be a big help. You're Peck? Who's the other Peck? Your sister or something? Actually... There is no other Peck, okay? She stole my uniform, she tried to kill you, and now she's trying to kill this other guy. And you know what? I really don't care if she does, but I would just rather she wasn't wearing my uniform when she did it, so why don't you tell us... Where this lowlife meth dealer is? And maybe we can save his life. Da-Danny baker. One-- One Parkside South. Yeah, no, I know that I am not Kevin. I'm calling to find someone who knows him so that I... Pardon? You kiss your mother with that mouth? Hello? Detective. Yeah. I've called 20 of the numbers on Reynolds' phone. 17 have hung up on me. Okay, what about the other 3? I hung up on them. He's not a very popular guy. It doesn't matter. His sisters are on their way down here, all right? They heard that some cops were swarming around his apartment, and they wanna know what happened. Did you tell 'em he's dead? No, 'cause we don't do notifications on the phone, so you'll have to tell them when they get here. You want me to do it? Yeah. You know, just use my office. Candice, where you headed? Just, uh, downtown. Queen Street. I heard it's pretty cool. All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift. No, that's okay. I'm fine. Thank you, though. No, I insist. Okay. Yeah. If you insist. You've been in town a week, you're only going shopping now? Been spending a lot of time in bed. J.D.'s a lucky man. That's what I keep telling him. What I don't get is why is he making you take a cab to Queen Street? He's not. It's my choice. You can't go shopping with a man hanging around bored out of his mind and making you feel guilty every time you wanna try a few things on, and when you're ready to go, you know, he's gone. Half an hour later, you find him at an electronics store watching football. You don't like football? Where did you say you were from again? Wisconsin. Right. Everybody loves football there. So you think the shooter knew these guys personally? Let's ask Danny Baker. He's a minor, few counts of possession. Probably one of Kevin Reynolds' low-level drug dealers. But this fake cop-- She is going to a lot of trouble just to take out a couple dealers. It's a crime of opportunity. Probably saw your uniform laying in the backseat of your car, decided to steal it, impersonate an officer, try to intimidate or kill someone. What's your take on the suspect? Well, I'm pissed that there's a killer out there pretending to be me. I am kind of impressed she took down a violent drug dealer all by herself. You asked me what I thought. Hi. I'm officer Nash. I'm Nadia. This is Sonya. We're Kevin's sisters. We heard there was trouble in his building. What'd he do this time? We're not posting his bail again if that's what this is about. Actually, why don't we take this somewhere a little more private? Wow, detective's office. Kevin's moving up in the world. Homicide. This looks bad. Did Kevin hurt somebody? I'm very sorry to inform you... That your brother is dead. How? He was shot. Who shot him? I-I can't share all the details right now, but as soon as we find out what's happened, I'll let you know. I'm sure this must come as a shock. Actually... no, it doesn't. Don't even get me started on Favre, seriously. He's the iron man of the NFL. Don't hack on him just 'cause he didn't finish at Green Bay. He finished his career three times. All the guy does is retire. J.D. like football? Come on. I wouldn't date anybody who doesn't like football. Tell you he spent time in prison? He said his father did time and that, you know, these things tend to run in the family. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what he was saying. That didn't send you running. I didn't know him back then. It's different now. I thought we were going downtown. We are. Just have to make a stop first. I knew he'd end up like this. Please. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Kevin was gonna get himself killed sooner or later. He was getting death threats in junior high. He set a neighbor's car on fire. With the neighbor still in it. Hid a bag of weed at his girlfriend's house. She almost went to jail for it. He used people. Kevin didn't care about anybody but himself. You must think we're terrible, talking about our brother like this. No. No, no. She's a cop, sonya. I'm sure she's seen it all. Is there anything else? Do you need us to sign something or... No, I guess not. Un-unless you can think of anybody who might have wanted him dead. I wouldn't even know where to start. All right, if this Danny kid's a target, there's a chance our impostor might already be on to him. So look sharp. You guys got the back? Yes, sir. Yeah? Danny Baker? Yeah, but, um, I can't talk now. Can you come back when my parents are home? Danny, we have reason to believe you might be in danger. He's going around the back! We got him. Chris, incoming. Let me go! I didn't do anything! Chill, all right? We're here to protect you. I don't know anything. Let me go. Look, man. Just take it easy, all right? Meth. Danny, you come with us. Let's go. Heard you had to give your first death notification. How was it? It was fine. Weird. I don't know. Everybody hated the guy. Yeah. He was a meth dealer, a menace to the neighborhood. Yeah, but these were his sisters, and they looked like they were going home to throw him a party. You still think there's good in everyone? Great.You find something good about Kevin Reynolds, you're a better detective than I am. Don't be so cynical. I'm a cop. I'm realistic. Not all cops think that way. You sure about that? So beautiful out here. Really should come back with J.D. when it gets a bit warmer. You just met this guy. How do you know you can trust him? I don't know. 'Cause when I met you guys at the bar that night, it just felt like we had a connection or something, you know? So a girl shows up in a bar with her stripper best friend then shacks up with the first guy she has a connection with? That's the story you're trying to tell me? I'm not trying to tell you anything. Come on, Candice from Wisconsin. Fine. My Dad is an alcoholic, and my mom left us. So I chose the route of stability. You know, I moved out, and I got engaged to Mr. Nice guy, and guess what. He cheated on me the week before the wedding. So after that, decided to get out of town with my best friend, who, yes, is a stripper but a very nice person regardless. We end up at a dive bar. I meet J.D., and for the first time in a really long time, I was starting to have fun, so I stayed. Let's go. Get out. So how long has it been? Since you got high. Whatever. Detective Callaghan says he's gonna be a while. I already told you I don't know anything. Why are you keeping me here? Your parents are deceased. You're underage. You got caught with 2 grams of meth. Unless we find more in here. What are you doing? That's my private stuff.You can't do that. 'Course we can. Danny, we're trying to help you. Kevin Reynolds is dead. Targeted. If you know the name of the woman who did it, you need to tell us now. I don't know any woman! So this is yours? Who is she? Girlfriend? Maybe you two were in on this together. Rip off your buddies, take over the business. No, it wasn't like that. This isn't her fault. Whose fault is it? It's mine! Then Christmas 2007, I buy Izzy a Packers Jersey. She's so happy, she cries-- cries from happiness. Couple months later, it's the Jets, then the Vikings. You have any idea how many jerseys this guy's cost me? You see this? This is how much I love hearing that story again and again and again. Believe me, everyone here knows how you feel about Brett Favre. Excuse me. Sorry. What's up, Nash? I need to know. I'm working on this case-- Detective Callaghan's case, and I'm just... Wondering what you think about... Look, spit it out, Nash. What do you need? What can we help you with? What are you wondering about? Do you believe in the basic goodness of mankind? Trick question. Don't joke. She's trying to be a good cop, and that's a very important question. So you agree. It is possible to find some good in all people? No. What's going on? Detective, do you believe that if you look hard enough, you can find good in everyone? You know I'm a homicide detective, right? Detective Callaghan? Yeah. We know who the shooter is. Your sister's name is Lindsay Baker. 22 years old, works at Value Town. Didn't show up to work today. Danny, where were you supposed to meet her? Look, we know you talked to her and that she told you to bring her these clothes. Look, if you wanna keep talking to him, I'll, uh, check in with the hospitals. Okay. What do you mean? Your sister didn't tell you? She got shot. While she was shooting at Kevin, I guess he decided to shoot back. I don't believe you. Okay, fine. There was a lot of blood at the crime scene, and not all of it was Kevin's. Danny, look, your sister is out there alone, and I know you wanna protect her, but she's in a lot of trouble, and she needs to go to the hospital. Are you lying? No. I'm not. She's at Allan Gardens. Supposed to meet her there once it got dark. You wouldn't even know you're in the city. I used to come down here with my wife. And then Maggie got pregnant. I'd come out and have picnics by the lake with Gracie. House in the suburbs, Two-car garage. We thought we were living the dream. Well, we were living the dream. What happened? They died. Car accident. Two months ago. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it was a freak accident. Well, that's what they think, anyway. Not sure. Maybe my past came back. I wasn't always a nice guy. I did some terrible things. Thing is, they paid the price, and all they ever did was, uh, love me. Like you-- had a rough go of it, but, uh, now you met J.D. now you think you're in love. You think he's the answer. But he's not. What is he, then? He's garbage wrapped in skin. Look, I don't wanna see you get hurt. I'm not gonna get hurt. Go home. Wisconsin's calling. Jamie... Look, there are a lot of hotels downtown. I don't wanna see you there tonight. Okay. Yeah, she came in a little while ago, said she needed a place to sit for a while. I didn't realize goofing off was such a serious offense for you guys. You know, she's not the first cop to come in here at night and take a nap. Which way did she go? I didn't see. She's gotta be around here somewhere. All right, I'll take the right. Drop the gun now. Where's Danny? He's fine. He's at the station. You know, he's really worried about you. He told us where you were. You're really hurt, so why don't--why don't you put the gun down and let me help you? No! I needed help six months ago. Danny was using crystal meth, and then he started dealing to keep using. I found this gun in his backpack. He's 16 years old, and this is what he carries with him. So you broke into my car and started dressing like a cop. I put it on, and people started listening to me. In about ten seconds, a bunch of real cops are gonna come around that corner and shoot you dead. Okay. Okay? But you and I both know that your brother will never recover from that. You think we don't care, that's fine. But he does. Lindsay, put down the weapon! Please. I'm not gonna ask you again! You're Peck. Yeah. That's my uniform you stole and got bullet holes in. You all right? She's bleeding. I need an EMS Here. You heard her. Call it in. No. I cleaned it up already. I put gauze on it. Guy at the drugstore didn't even charge me, 'cause I'm a cop. Yeah. You're not a cop, Lindsay. So it looks like we are both gonna be getting out of work on time tonight. You'll be pleased to know everyone around here agrees with you. Some people are all bad. You win. Well, Trace, you asked a bunch of cops if they thought people were dirtbags. You didn't stand a chance. So I guess I lied to my son. A couple of years ago, Kevin Reynolds was in a hit and run. Please, Jerry, I don't wanna hear any more horrible stuff this guy did. I don't. He broke his wrist, and instead of going straight to the hospital, he picked up a dog that was hit by the other car and he carried that dog four blocks to the vet. How do you know that? Well, I was one of the uniforms on the scene. I tracked him to the animal hospital on Bathurst Street. Did that really happen? I would tell Leo it did if he asked. What are you doing here? Did you get your mortgage? No. What happened? I screwed up. I think I screwed up. I saw Sam. Andy, what are you think-- I know. The guy from the bar showed up. Jamie Brennan? Yeah. I mean, when I was at Sam's place, he came by, and he ended up driving me out to Cherry Beach. Oh my God. Jamie Brennan, enforcer with the North End Guys. He's a primary suspect in... Six murder cases?" That's just what they know of. I mean, two of them were tortured to death. Did he make you as a cop? I don't know. I mean, I-I kept it together, but, you know, maybe the real Candice would've been really scared, you know, that some strange guy picks her up, and I... He told me to stay away tonight. He said he was gonna go and see Sam. So call Sam and tell him. I don't have his number. I gotta tell Frank. No, you can't. They're gonna shut down the whole operation. I can't risk this. Okay, maybe Brennan knows. Maybe he's figured it out. I mean, what if he hurts Sam? What's up, McNally? Sir, um, I have something I need to tell you. How many times have you been to his apartment? Once, after the first time. Twice. Do you have any idea what you've done, McNally? Not only have you embarrassed this division, and me personally, but you've jeopardized an undercover operation that's been underway for months! You've put an undercover officer's life in danger! I know. I'm sorry. Get me guns and gangs. Frank, you got a minute? We got a situation. We need to talk, now. Stay here. What is it? Who is it? Open up. It's me. So what's happening? Where's, uh, Candice? She's not back yet. I was thinking about that-- that boat of yours. Okay. I thought, uh, maybe hit the Alpine, have a couple beers, talk a little business. Yeah? Good. If you're not too busy-- I don't know-- watching the football game. No, man. I'm good. I'm not a big football guy. So I'll meet you there, yeah? No use taking two cars. I'm right outside. Sure. Right, thanks. Child Services is taking Danny down to the hospital to see his sister. He's agreed to a rehab program for kids at Sunnybrook. What about Lindsay? She'll be back on her feet and ready for trial in no time. Okay, you know what? Luke, I called my mom. I asked her to pull some strings, maybe get her a half decent lawyer from Legal Aid. You know Lindsay told me that wearing the uniform made her feel like a powerful person. God, I wish it was that easy. You are a powerful person. That doesn't look good. Gail. We've, uh, we've been talking. Yeah, not about anything that... happened. Or didn't-- or didn't happen. No, just about whether, you know, the three of us could go back to being friends again. You know, like normal. Like the way things were before. Yeah. You were never normal. We were never friends. But, hey, sucking up to me makes you feel better about yourself, knock yourselves out. She's back. Yep. Williams, Shaw, come with me. Okay, bring them around. Be there in two. All right, let's go. Yeah, I got one, two, three, four, five. Trace, what's going on? I don't know. Something about Swarek and a problem with the wire. Give me your car keys. Here. McNally, what are you doing here? What is she doing here? I don't know. Don't step on the evidence. Look. All non-necessary personnel I need you to clear outta here, please! Jerry, what's going on? What is she doing here? No. Get her outta here! Get her outta here right now! Sam. Let's go. No! Where's Sam?! Sam.
