 All right, all right I admit Epstein's better than I thought he'd be. 
 Yeah. He's the reason 15's gonna own 27. 
 27 is a superior division. 
 I'll bet you anything. 
 100 bucks. 
 100 bucks. 
 100 bucks you guys shut up, please. 
 Dude, you were unreal today. 
 Nah, it's... it's nothing. I took a couple lessons to get ready. It's no big deal. 
 No big deal? 
 You were on fire out there. 
 You're like the urban cowboy... on fire. 
 Right? Come on. 
 And it's the first day. 
 I mean, most of us couldn't even get up on the horse the first day. 
 You're gonna fly through this training, bro. 
 All right, come on. We're here. Let's go. 
 I just gotta get my stuff together. 
 What stuff? 
 You know, my things, my stuff. 
 Okay. 
 Go ahead. I'll catch up to you. 
 Nothing. It's nothing. 
 I-I think I tweaked my back a little bit on that last jump, but I'm fine. 
 Well, is it bad, like, hospital bad? 
 No. No, it's... 
 Yeah, it's bad. 
 Rookie Blue Season 02 Episode 09 
Brotherhood 
Original Air Date: August 18, 2011 
 So any cute boys at horse camp? 
 I don't know. I wouldn't know. I don't care. I'm over cops, completely over them. 
 I would have thought it'd be the perfect time to get right back up on that horse. 
 No, I want to be alone right now. 
 Andy McNally, lone wolf? 
 So? 
 I get it. I like it. 
 Alright. 
 Ladies. 
 How's the back? 
 Back's fine. It's my heart that's broken. 
 You know how long I've been looking forward to this mounted unit training? 
 Yeah, I'm surprised they cleared you to get back out on shift. 
 No, I'm... I'm fine. It's just a lateral muscle sprain. 
 No big deal. As long as I take a couple of these... every few hours, I'm good to go. Just... 
 No cantering for a while. 
 The reins go under the horse's mouth, but last time the reins go over... 
 Really? I mean, come on. 
 It's like I'm not already having a crappy enough day? 
 Chris was just teaching me the difference between riding Western and English. 
 What, were you taking notes yesterday? 
 Yeah. I mean... 
 Dov really wouldn't know because he's too busy popping pills and icing his back. 
 Thanks, babe. 
 You're quiet. 
 So? Arrest me. 
 She is not feeling the love today. 
 That's my thing. 
 All right, guys. We're gonna be late. We should probably hit the parade. 
 Do you want me to call wheel-trans? 
 No, it's okay. I'll just take your broomstick. 
 Callaghan. 
 Kirkus trial. 
 Evidence box 9 of 26. 
 If these get too heavy, you give us a holler. I'll call you a rookie. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 And lift with your legs. 
 Right. 
 You know, hey, hey. Come here. 
 I got something I wanna run by you, all right? Something personal. 
 I say go for it, brother. Shave that back. 
 Ass. You're an ass. 
 Where to start? Where to start? 
 How about the mounted unit training report, day one? 
 Happy? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't be. 
 It says here,"Your rooks showed up nervous, rode tight, came generally unprepared. 
 The candidates from 27 division fared far better. 
 Sir, if... if I might... 
 Skip it, Epstein. 
 You're the only one who got a decent report. 
 Now you all might think that this mounted training is no big deal, special skill to pad your résumé. 
 But I went to bat for you on this, told them that I had 3 rookies from 15 who was worth their time. 
 Look at the person next to you. 
 For a second, if you would. Go ahead. 
 All of you. 
 That is the person that deserves your very best. 
 And I expect much better from you today. 
 Moving on. 
 Detective Callaghan is prepping the Kirkus trial. 
 Officer Williams testifies tomorrow morning. 
 Now the rest of you, get out there. Do your best, because that's what we do. 
 You all right? Epstein? 
 Officer Williams, you got a sec? 
 You may be the best rookies downtown has to offer, but you don't know squat about horses, and that's all that matters to me. 
 So hit your stalls, tack up, and let's learn how to ride. 
 Of course I don't know squat about horses. What's that guy's problem? 
 You want me to ask him? 
 No, I don't want you to ask him. 
 I swear, this job attracts power-tripping, insecure control freaks. 
 Not you. 
 Guy. 
 I swear, Diaz. I don't know how you get any work done, man. 
 Don't even try, Samuels. I'm off cops. 
 Shucks. I should have pounced back at the academy when I had my chance. 
 You never had a chance. 
 I love you. 
 Well, at least I get to hang out with my buddy Diaz over here. 
 I've been trying to get together with this guy for ages. 
 But then my best old friend here gets a girlfriend and... 
 Not just a girlfriend. A Peck. 
 Seriously, man. Nobody's ever been such a good friend, you know that. 
 Dude. 
 It's just so good to hang out with you again, man. 
 Dude, right? 
 Yes! 
 Remember, remember, remember? 
 What? 
 Screw horse camp. 
 This is what I love right here... the open road, serving, protecting. 
 Picking up losers all day long. 
 I happen to enjoy my job. 
 S. One, attend 1582 Spadina for a bomb threat. 
 Female caller said there's a bomb in the restaurant kitchen. 
 ATF is on scene. Request units for backup. 
 1519 on it. 
 Sweet. Things are looking up. 
 Right, 'cause you get to see your new girlfriend Betty Bombsquad? 
 You know what? There's a lot you could learn from Sue, okay? 
 She's fearless, courageous, hilarious, and she doesn't have a clove of garlic where her heart's supposed to be. 
 Really? 'Cause there's actually a couple things you can learn from Chris. 
 Well, I guess we're both with the right people. 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Traci Nash flying solo. 
 Yeah, I like it. It's nice and quiet. 
 Lucky you. 
 All right, so I need you guys to keep everyone outside the perimeter. 
 You find anything yet? 
 I just got here. 
 Cleared it, but we still have to sweep. 
 Could be a swatter. 
 What the hell is a swatter? 
 Someone who calls in a fake bomb threat to see his awesome girlfriend in action. 
 So what, we still don't know if there's a bomb in there? 
 Some woman called it in, tried to, uh, block the number. 
 Took our binary guys about five seconds to crack it. Here. 
 Mary Vu, 1290 Carlaw. 
 All right, let's go. 
 If you don't mind, I'll, uh, steal Epstein here. I could use him on scene. 
 Keys. 
 Looks like I'm riding with you. 
 Yeah, so much for quiet or nice. 
 Officer Williams? Noelle? 
 Noelle, you got a minute? 
 How's it going? 
 Trial prep... it's... it's... It's good. It's going good. 
 No, I'm talking about the whole baby thing, the wanting to have one, the I.V.F.? 
 Everything's fine. Thanks for asking. 
 Noelle... 
 You know, I think we should talk about this. 
 You do, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I don't. 
 Got it. 
 Ma'am, how many times do I have to tell you? No more pictures, please. 
 Seriously? 
 See you smile, ah? 
 A-a bomb threat? 
 Call was traced to your cell phone. 
 It wasn't me. 
 So you're saying your phone called all on its own, ma'am? 
 I don't even know where it is. Someone must have stolen it. 
 So someone stole your phone, called in a bomb threat, and then put it back in your pocket? 
 Guess so. 
 Don't test me. 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 Well, you should be. 
 Well, I'm not. 
 What do you say, Officer Nash, we take her back to the station... and find out the whole story? 
 I'll meet you on the street! 
 Do it! 
 Mary! 
 I got her! 
 Mary, hold up! 
 If you want to arrest me, go ahead! I have nothing to say to you! 
 What is going on here? 
 Seriously, Mary, what's going on? 
 I have nothing to say to you. 
 Mary, you gotta tell us what you know. 
 Is there a bomb in that restaurant or not? 
 I have to pee. 
 Not gonna work. 
 I just took you five minutes ago. 
 What do you want from me? 
 The truth! 
 It's the easiest thing to remember. Why did you call in a bomb threat? 
 That restaurant is a known hangout for gang activity, okay? 
 If you are connected, we're gonna find out. 
 I worked there for six months washing dishes. 
 The owner never paid me a cent. 
 I wanted to get back at him. 
 You're lying. 
 You're scared. 
 You don't know me. 
 No, but I do know what it's like to be acting all tough when really you're terrified. 
 You can trust me, okay? 
 Mary, you can trust me. 
 That is a surveillance photo taken at David Ing's wedding. 
 Shangri-La Banquet Hall, two months ago. 
 This is Officer Swarek. He works in our Guns and Gangs Unit. 
 That's you, Mary, uh, cuddling up to... I'm guessssg that's your boyfriend... 
 And you guys are sitting next to Tommy Chan, crime boss of Wah Ching. 
 I have to pee. 
 Well, fire away. You won't be the first person to go in here. 
 And when you're all done, you're gonna tell me how you know Tommy Chan. 
 Can I speak to you a minute, Officer Swarek? 
 I think I can get her to talk. 
 With all due respect, sir, I was building a report. 
 Epstein says the restaurant's clear. No bomb. 
 All right, you wanna start with finding out why she called in a hoax, please? 
 That I can do. 
 All right, here's how it goes. 
 On the whistle, you mount your horse, weave through the slalom course place your cup of water on the second pole without spilling a drop. You got it? 
 All right, McNally, you're up. 
 I can't wait to see McNally try. 
 Eyes forward. Find a spot for your turn. 
 Head up! 
 Next. 
 Dude, you are so going down out there. 
 In your dreams, Edmonton. 
 Edmonton! Just like the old days, brother, back at the academy. 
 Diaz. Samuels. 
 Are you nervous? 
 No, man, compared to what I've had to go through, this is a friggin' holiday. 
 Why, man? What's, uh, going on? 
 Diaz! 
 Looks like you're up, man. 
 Work your magic, brother. 
 All right. Come on. 
 All landed immigrants from Hong Kong the last five years. 
 Are these just the men? 
 Wait, wait, wait. Go back a photo. Let me see him. 
 That guy? 
 Yeah. 
 There's no record of him. He's not even a known associate. We need a name. 
 Sue Tran. Drinks with A.T.F. Do I go? 
 Why wouldn't you? 
 Because she's, like, "The Hurt Locker." I'm a rookie cop. 
 Dov, if you stayed home every single time someone was cooler than you, you'd be like one of those ladies from "Grey Gardens." 
 Stop trying to be all Swarek about everything. 
 You may as well just tell her how you feel about her. 
 Bingo. 
 We got a match. 
 I know you don't think so, but... 
 You can talk to me, Mary. 
 I mean, sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger. 
 You gotta think of it like... confession. 
 This is Officer Epstein. You've already met Officer Peck. 
 Coffee. 
 You made me run after you. I am not getting you a coffee. 
 No, it's just... the smell. 
 Kenneth Chan... arrived from Hong Kong two years ago, sponsor Bo Chan, relationship... great aunt. 
 Mary, what can you tell us about your boyfriend Kenneth? 
 He ask you to make that call? 
 Can she put the coffee outside? The smell is... is... 
 You're pregnant. 
 Always having to pee, supersonic sense of smell. I should've known. 
 And Kenneth is the father. 
 Mary? 
 He not like his family, all right? 
 But his cousin Tommy always pressuring him,"Come. Work for me." 
 Kenny always say no, but when I told him about the baby, he says we need the money. 
 Right. The gangster with the heart of gold. 
 Where have I heard that story before? 
 Maybe from every girlfriend of every banger I've ever met. 
 So... sorry if we don't empathize. 
 I don't care! I telling the truth. 
 Last night he tell me. He says I can't tell anyone. 
 He going to work for his cousin, join the gang. 
 So why would he make you call in a bomb threat to a rival gang's restaurant? 
 He didn't! 
 I just... I just want to buy some time, shut the place down, convince him not to do it! 
 Do what, exactly? 
 Wah Ching initiation. 
 Tonight at the restaurant, he going to kill someone. 
 The Wah Ching, Chinese gang. 
 Huge in the late '70s, early '80s. 
 Chinese immigrants who'd come over from Hong Kong with nothing to lose, and these are their kids, Wah Ching's second generation. 
 Gangbanging is all they've ever known. 
 All right, and that makes them even more dangerous. 
 Tommy Chan here... he's now the acting Dai Lo. 
 The boss? 
 Yeah. You speak cantonese? 
 No, sir, you just put him at the top of the pyramid. 
 All right, listen up. 
 Two weeks ago, a truck carrying 200 grand worth of Wah Ching merchandise was hijacked, probably by a rival triad. 
 Is it heroin? Opium? 
 Counterfeit designer watches. Sell for 30, 40 bucks a pop in Chinatown. 
 Look, Kenny Chan's hit has to be retaliation for the truck robbery. 
 If we don't pick him up, someone gets shot. 
 All right, so Officer Swarek and me... We're gonna cruise Chan's regular haunts. 
 Peckstein, the aunt who sponsored him, sells ginseng over in Chinatown. you're gonna go and have a little chat with her. 
 And, Nash, since you built a report with the girlfriend, get her discharged. 
 On it, sir. 
 All right, we've got about four hours to find this garbage and get him off the street before he shoots somebody. 
 Okay, let's do it. 
 Epstein. 
 Yeah? 
 That's my line. 
 Great to see Samuels, huh? 
 Not really. What happened with you guys anyway? 
 I mean, you guys were inseparable at the academy. 
 Yeah. I don't know... Hours, different divisions. 
 I guess. 
 Officer McNally, can I speak to you, please? 
 Yep. 
 If I'm not back in ten... 
 McNally in riding pants. God, I love my job. 
 I really do, you know that? I love being a cop. 
 Me, too. 
 It's all I've ever wanted, dude. 
 So, uh, so what's going on? 
 Nothing, really. It's... 
 No. Come on, man. Maybe I can help. 
 Well, a few weeks ago, I was riding solo, back end in a 10 out of 12. 
 I was up at least 30 hours straight. 
 Fell asleep at the wheel, brother, wrapped my cruiser around a pole. 
 Are you serious? 
 I mean, a-are they investigating? 
 Well, yeah, you know, standard stuff... how fast I was going, you know, how many shifts I worked in a row, was alcohol a factor? 
 Was it? 
 No. God, no. Dude, I learned my lesson from last time, man. 
 But they are looking into my past record. 
 Yeah, I know. I know. Long time ago, right? 
 But the thing is, someone is, uh, supposed to call you. 
 What? 
 Dude. Come on, man. It was me and you in the car. 
 You were the only other guy there. Who else are they gonna call, man? 
 And you gave a sworn deposition, so... 
 Look, are you asking me to lie for you again? 
 No. I'm saying maybe we should just stick to the same story. 
 You know what, man? It's just been so great hanging out with you. 
 I... you know what? I'm sorry I just... 
 I'm sorry I even brought this up. I mean, this is... 
 I feel an obligation as your best friend to tell you, to give you a heads-up, you know? 
 They probably won't even call. Don't worry. It's good. 
 Me? 
 No. God, no. Me. 
 "Miss you. Wish you were here. X.O.X.O., Chris." 
 There's a man who doesn't hide his feelings. 
 Yeah. 
 What does that mean? 
 Uh... nothing no, no. He's uh... 
 Dude's my best friend, all right? It's just... he's not exactly complex. 
 Are you calling my boyfriend simple? 
 No, I'm calling him amazing. 
 He's got such a big heart, you know, he's like a big, uh... Border Collie. 
 Officer McNally, you're riding a horse, not playing the accordion. 
 Well, how am I supposed to hold the reins? 
 How I told you. 
 How did you tell me? 
 By opening my mouth and making words come out. 
 Wow why are you being such a jerk? 
 Honestly, I mean, this is supposed to be fun, you know, riding horses out in the fresh air. 
 This is supposed to be a break from drugs and domestics and dead bodies. 
 Where was your last homicide? 
 When or where? 
 Where. 
 Jane and Finch. 
 Last week, the corridor in front of the sub shop? You worked that? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Us, too. 
 After you left, when everybody was too afraid to come out of their houses. 
 What do you mean? 
 I rode up there with a few guys, and the kids ran out in the street to see the horses. 
 Their parents came, too. 
 People returned to the streets, which makes the neighborhood safe. 
 I'm from that neighborhood. 
 People don't trust cops. 
 But these aimals, these horses... they humanize us. 
 I just love this unit a lot. 
 Did I really look like I was playing an accordion? 
 A really big one, very badly. 
 22 seconds flat. 
 Nice work, McNally. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 All right, listen, brother, that thing that I wanted to run by you... 
 Yeah, right, the personal matter. 
 Don't say it like that, though. 
 What? What did I say? 
 "Personal matter." You make it sound like I can't hoist the sail or something. 
 You can't hoist the sail? I can't help with that, brother. 
 No, listen, that is not what I'm talking about here, okay? I got the opposite problem. When Zoe and I got married, she made three rules. 
 She said that if I stuck to the rules, we'd have no problems. All right? 
 There is no hard drugs, there is no head spins, no strippers. 
 No head spins? What are head spins? 
 I did some break-dancing in my teens and my early 20s. 
 You never did any break dancing. 
 That's not... that's not the point. That's not the point. 
 Price's retirement dinner last weekend... 
 Yeah, I was there. What about it? 
 Yeah, no, after the dinner, some of the boys moved the party over to Jilly's. 
 Strippers. 
 Not, "Oh, strippers." This is the first time... 
 What? 
 First time in 14 years of marriage that I ever broke one of her rules. 
 All right. 
 Okay? Now this is my question... do I tell her? 
 I don't know. 
 Yes, 100%. Tell her. 
 Good. Okay. 
 Thank you, brother. 
 You're welcome. 
 Let's go get some dim sum. 
 Sure. 
 Hot water with lemon? You okay? 
 It's for a girl we brought in. She's pregnant. 
 The hoax bomb threat. And she's still here? 
 Yeah, paperwork is taking forever. 
 Right. She did it to protect her sad-sack boyfriend from making a terrible mistake. 
 Sam doesn't believe her either. 
 What, you do? 
 Well, then you go with that. I mean, the whole time we've been dating, your instincts have only been wrong once. 
 Medieval times? 
 Yep. 
 How was that not fun? We got to swill mead. 
 You're a good cop with good instincts. Trust that. 
 Milady. 
 One hot water with lemon. 
 Thank you. 
 It's all I can stomach. 
 Are you kidding? I lived on ginger tea and arrowroots. 
 You have a kid? 
 Yeah. I have a son. He's 7. 
 You look great. 
 Well, you know, it helps when you have them in high school. 
 High school? 
 It's okay. It's not a secret. Not anymore. 
 Your husband... He a cop, too? 
 I don't have a husband. 
 So you raise him on your own? 
 Pretty much, yeah. My mom helps out a lot, though. 
 My mom in China. 
 Well, still, she must be pretty excited. 
 I can't be part of this. 
 I agree. 
 I can't bring a kid into that. I know. 
 But I don't know how I going to do it on my own. 
 Your paperwork has come through, Mary. 
 You're free to go. 
 Come on. 
 I'm gonna give you a lift. Okay? 
 It was, like, ten minutes ago, man. I swear to you, I saw him myself. 
 And you're sure it was Kenny Chan? 
 He was leaving the nightclub Fluid. Go check it out, man. He can't be far. 
 All right. Don't buy drugs. 
 Thanks, Sammy. 
 So what do we think Kenny Chan is doing in the entertainment district at 4:00 P.M. on a Tuesday afternoon? 
 Picking up a piece, maybe. 
 Maybe he's picking up a piece. 
 Restaurant? 
 Sounds good. Let's go. 
 That way. 
 Here, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny. 
 Here, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny. 
 Peck here. 
 It's Swarek. We got a 20 on Kenny Chan. We think he's armed. 
 I need you and Epstein outside his apartment in case he shows up there. 
 Roger that. 
 Stake out the apartment. Like anything is gonna happen there. Please. 
 Are you okay? 
 Always the bridesmaid, never the bomb squad. 
 What are you babbling about? 
 Not so loud. 
 I have very small listening cones. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 Nothin'. 
 Dov? Dov, how many of those have you taken? 
 Excellent question, Officer Peck. Not one I can answer, but excellent question. 
 Oh my God. You're totally stoned right now. 
 Dov, we're on duty, and we're trying to find an armed gangster, and you're higher than a kite. 
 Here, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Okay, home sweet home. 
 I will call you as soon as we know anything. Okay? 
 You all right? 
 I'm fine. 
 Okay. 
 But, uh, would you mind just staying for a bit? 
 Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'm, uh, at the end of my shift, and my kid's with his Dad tonight. So... 
 Do you have ginger? 
 Yes. 
 Honey? 
 Yes. 
 Lemon? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, why don't you take a seat? I'll make you some of that famous ginger tea. 
 I can't believe you're stoned on duty. 
 I took the right dose. 
 Must be having an adverse reaction. 
 Yeah, you and me both. 
 Be cool, Gail. Be cool. 
 Shut up. 
 You have any 5-cent candies? 
 You know what? Actually, keep talking, 'cause I'm gonna tell your girlfriend every little thing you said next time she comes over to watch one of her stupid dancing shows. 
 I love that she watches stupid dancing shows even though she can't dance. 
 I love that she's pretty and funny and smart, pretty much the most incredible girl that I've ever dated. 
 The only thing wrong with her... 
 She's dating an idiot for a boyfriend who's higher than a lab monkey? 
 No. The only thing wrong with her is that she's not you. 
 What? 
 I mean, if she was you or if I was Chris, I'd believe in luck of the soul, the possibility of anything. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 And I'd marry you. I would. 
 And we'd open our presents on Christmas morning, not Christmas Eve. 
 And I'd take a desk job. 
 I hit 50. I lose my hair, my mind, listen to jazz, embarrass our kids. 
 Our kids... with their straw-colored hair and your eyes... 
 I'd wake up every morning and wonder at my dumb, dumb, dumb luck. 
 If I was Chris. 
 Why is the place empty? 
 Plenty of room to shoot somebody? 
 Maybe. 
 Red star hoodie. 
 Thank God for gang symbols. 
 Kenny Chan, stop where you are. On your knees. 
 Hands where I can see them. 
 Wrong guy, Sam. Get up. 
 Good evening, officers. 
 Tommy Chan. 
 I believe you're looking for my cousin Kenny. 
 You can search all you want. You won't find anything. 
 Shut up. Check his texts and his calls. 
 Turn around, put your hands behind your back. 
 Last text was two minutes ago. 
 What's it say? 
 It's Cantonese. I don't know. You can, uh, speak Cantonese? 
 No? You? Yeah? Can you translate this for me? What does this say? 
 "It's her. Mary is the leak." 
 Mary? 
 "Mary is the leak?" 
 That's Kenny's girlfriend. She called in the bomb threat. 
 It wasn't gonna be a hit. It was a test. They fed her bogus information. 
 And she called us. 
 She walked right into it. 
 Mary Vu... that's who they're gonna kill. 
 Mary Vu's not picking up her cell. 
 All right, call Peckstein. Let's start with getting 'em over to Mary Vu's place. 
 We'll drop Tommy off and meet 'em there. 
 Gimme that. 
 The phone, Dov. 
 Peck here. 
 Where's Epstein? Where are you guys? 
 King and Spadina. What's happening? 
 All right, the hit's on Mary Vu. 1290 Carlaw. 
 You gotta get there right now. 
 1290 Carlaw. We're on it. Okay. 
 It's as bad as they say, isn't it... labor pain? 
 Worse. 
 Great. 
 But then it's crazy. 
 'Cause, like, minutes later, then you have this child lying on your chest and it's like... amnesia. 
 Blissful amnesia. 
 Dov? Dov! 
 I'm okay. 
 I don't believe this. Dispatch, this is 1519 we're heading to 1290 Carlaw. We need backup. 
 Copy. 1503 and 1522, please proceed to 1290 Carlaw. 
 Gail, I'm okay. 
 Shut up! 
 I'm just gonna grab your tea. I'll be right back. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Put the gun down. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Turn it off. 
 Officer Nash? You okay in there? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just relax. 
 Get on your knees. Please. Just get on your knees. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Give me your gun. 
 Take it easy. 
 Come on. Just give me your gun. 
 No. 
 Kenny? 
 Get back in the living room! 
 What the hell are you doing?! 
 You talked to the cops? 
 I told you you couldn't tell another living soul, and you talk to the cops?! How could you? 
 What the hell else was I supposed to do? 
 What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot me? 
 Stay back! 
 Calm down. 
 Everybody just calm down. 
 Well, somebody obviously beat us here. Who's in car 1504? 
 Look who I'm asking. 
 Dispatch, this is 1519. Who the hell is in car 1504? 
 1504... is Nash's car. 
 Okay, call her. 
 You can still go back on this, Kenny. 
 No. It's over. 
 No, it's not. 
 You can still walk. You haven't done anything yet, not really. 
 You can still get outta this. 
 She told us because she loves you, Kenny. 
 She wants to get out of here with you, somewhere safe, and you can do that right now. 
 You can still do it. You can still walk away. 
 No answer. 
 Get back in the car. 
 Gail, I'm fine. 
 Get back in the car. 
 What happens when backup gets here, and I'm sitting in the squad car? 
 We tell them the truth. You had a really bad reaction to some medication you're on, and that's it. 
 It wasn't safe for you to go in. Now get back in... get back in the car. 
 Sit tight. Just stay here. Watch the door. I'm sure it's nothing. 
 Give me your pills. 
 How are we supposed to make it? 
 We will make it. 
 We need money. 
 So we do what we have to do. 
 Listen to Mary, Kenny. 
 If that means washing dishes, that's what we will do, for her. 
 You will do it for her. 
 Okay? You're gonna do it all for that tiny little person in there, the one that's making your girlfriend so sick right now. Okay? 
 You can do it. 
 You will make it. 
 Police! 
 Officer Nash, is everything okay in there? 
 Yeah, come in. You can cuff him. 
 Kenny Chan, you're under arrest for assault with a weapon. 
 I didn't want to do this. 
 I never wanted to do any of this. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Must've been nice to hang out with Samuels. 
 You guys are like old friends, huh? 
 Yeah, we were. Just haven't seen him in a while. 
 Maybe that's why he signed up. 
 You know, it wasn't until he heard you were gonna be here that he showed any interest. 
 What? 
 Will you excuse me a second? 
 Wow, you clean up good. 
 I just sent my daily report off to your staff sergeant. 
 You wanna know what it says? 
 No, I don't. I don't care. 
 You know what? I had a lot of fun today. I feel better than I have in a long time. 
 Go out with me. 
 Pardon me? 
 I'm a lot better with horses than I am people, but I would really like to take you out. 
 Nope. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm not ready for that. 
 You just... you'd be a rebound, and, uh, I think you deserve better than that, but thank you. 
 For what? 
 I really needed you... and this. 
 Hold on a second. Did you fudge my competition time 'cause you wanted to ask me out? 
 Absolutely. 
 So you're gonna be harder on me tomorrow? 
 Absolutely. 
 Great. 
 You knew I was gonna be here, didn't you? 
 That's the only reason you signed up for this training. 
 Whoa, bro no, don't don't don't bro" me, okay? 
 Look, I don't know what happened this time. 
 Okay, I wasn't there this time, but I do know what happened last time, and here's what I know. 
 Okay, we went out, you got hammered, you wouldn't give me the keys, you did 120 in a 60 zone, and you wrapped your car around a tree. 
 Okay, and then I lied about it. That's what I know. 
 Yeah, you know what? And if you say that, they'll just know you covered for me. 
 You'll go down just as hard. 
 I know. 
 Chris, you worked hard for this, man. You worked way too hard for this. 
 I know! Okay? 
 Which is why I'm gonna do it again. Which is why I'm gonna lie for you again. 
 Cool. 
 Listen, some of the guys are going out... 
 What, for drinks? 
 Yeah. 
 No, man, I'm out. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You still at that girl's place? 
 Yeah. I don't want her to wake up alone, so... 
 You think that conspiracy charge on Tommy Chan will stick? 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, that lawyer's suit's worth more than my car. 
 Long odds. 
 Yeah. 
 Jerry, we're good, right? 
 What do you mean? 
 We're gonna be good, right? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, you're a good cop, good instincts. What does your gut say? 
 Yeah, we're gonna be good. 
 Good answer. 
 Sammy. 
 Thank you so much. Thank you so much, brother. 
 What for, man? 
 Well, I just... I talked to Zoe like you told me to, told her about the strippers. 
 And? 
 Well, she told me not to come home tonight! 
 What the hell are you doing asking me for relationship advice? 
 Well, you got me, man. I don't know. 
 Just give her some time, brother. She'll come around. She'll come around. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Guess what. Until then, you're buying. 
 And guess what. I'm your new roommate. 
 Okay. You wanna talk, talk, the thing is, I know what you're gonna say, and I-I get it. 
 I agree 100%. You can't do it. You can't. I mean, I wouldn't. 
 Can't what? 
 You can't start dating a 38-year-old woman who wants a baby so badly she's working every overtime shift so she can get to pay for very expensive fertility treatments. 
 I mean, why the hell would you jump on board for that? 
 I mean, we haven't even kissed yet. 
 Thanks. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Where's, uh, where's Peckstein? I mean, they should be here by now. 
 I know. I missed 'em today. 
 Don't tell Gail I just said that. 
 Oh God. I make a terrible lone wolf. 
 You do. 
 Okay, if I tell you something, you promise just to keep it between us? 
 Sure. 
 I love being a cop. 
 Andy... that's not a secret. All right? Cheers. 
 All right. I'm gonna call Gail. Be right back? 
 All right. 
 You know, I really don't mind driving you home. It's really not a big deal. 
 No, it's okay. The nurse said I was fine, you know? 
 I'll just stick to juice. 
 Okay. 
 I told Chris we'd meet him inside. 
 Okay. 
 Gail? 
 Don't. 
 Okay. 
 We should go in. 
 Yeah.
