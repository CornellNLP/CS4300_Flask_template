 [man] Previously, on Penny Dreadful: City of Angels...   
 [Molly] And what if I have feelings for Detective Vega?   
 Strong feelings?   
 Your flock need to feel as if you're married only to the church.   
 All the good work you do in the world can go away.   
 [Linda] If you think you're bringing that German whore into my house...   
 You will be checking into a sanitarium.    
 [girl] Tommy? Tommy?    
 - [breathy scream] 
- [hyperventilating]    
 [Lewis] Germans get that rocket, the fight's over.    
 Kill him.    
 [groaning]    
 I'll tell you who the other f*cking guy is!    
 - [heavy slam] 
- [groaning]    
 Tiago!    
 Your f*cking brother, and you didn't tell me!    
 [Lewis] Hazlett was the beginning.    
 - You killed him. 
- What?    
 Him, the wife, the kids.    
 Reilly too, of course.    
 You're going to San Quentin, and you're not coming out.    
 All you still get to decide is whether you go as a rat or as a goddamn legend.

 Yeah.    
 [bird caws distantly]    
 You're in need of a shave.    
 I could help.    
 Yes, I've become quite adept at that.    
 Jesus washed the feet of his disciples.    
 I shave the faces of mine.    
 The ones at the soup kitchen anyway.    
 You really do that?    
 I have no pride before my congregation.    
 They would smell it a mile off.

 Captain gave us the week off.    
 Reward for a job well done.    
 - So this Mexican boy... 
- He's not Mexican.    
 He's a Chicano. It's different.    
 I didn't mean anything.    
 Can we not talk about work?    
 James Hazlett was important to me.    
 You know that.

 [Goss] Dare to imagine a future with me, Brian.    
 No war, no poverty.     
 Only the greatest minds and hearts walking side by side to live and flourish together.     
 The place you shall find the destiny you so richly deserve.     
 Your mind is an indispensable asset to our new Eden.     
 You see that stretch of land right over there by those oaks?     
 That is to be the location of your very own laboratory.     
 You'll have all the state-of-the-art equipment of which you could ever dream, and one day, you'll share your beautiful ideas with the Fuehrer himself.     
 The Fuehrer?     
 This is to be his new Eagle's Nest, his heart and home in the new world, surrounded by God's good nature.     
 You see, this is what people don't understand about us.     
 We are builders, not destroyers.     
 I am architect, a city planner.     
 So what pleases me is this, imagining the future in your mind, and bringing it to life in stone and steel, building a new, better world for everyone.     
 What if I can't figure out the engine for the new rocket?     
 Oh, you will.

 Well, this is how it is with your mother.     
 When is she coming home?

 It may be some time yet.     
 And you know, sometimes things change in our lives.

 Little Frank and I, we had nothing like this.     
 Do you have any special things like this in your home?     
 We have a set with ivory handles from my grandfather, but we only use them on rare occasions.     
 Yeah.     
 Rare occasions, I see.     
 Oh, Maria, I'm sorry.     
 This must be so strange and confusing.     
 To be honest, it is strange for me too.     
 I'm only here to help.     
 But I know how highly Peter thinks of you.     
 I just... I want things to be good, yeah?     
 I want us all to be happy.     
 Of course, Mrs. Branson.     
 I have one more thing to ask of you, if I might.     
 Well...     
 I'm worried about Frank.     
 This whole change is so frightening for him.     
 I think it would help if he stayed with Tom in his room.     
 He's so fond of him.     
 Well, of course we can dec...     
 But I think also, Trevor is getting older and should have his own room.     
 Yeah?     
 Would you like him to have mine?     
 It's just, I know you don't often spend the night.     
 I was thinking you could have the room by the garage.     
 [Peter] Ah, yes, hello.     
 How are my two best girls settling in?     
 Oh, we were just discussing how to settle the boys.     
 Would you prefer I move to the room next to the garage,     
 Dr. Craft?     
 Uh...     
 Oh, I, uh, yeah, I think that would be best.     
 For now, that is.

 What I had was the Yiddish theater.     
 My family had a troupe that performed in a tavern back east.     
 No spaceships.     
 But we had King Lear, Faust, and dozens of our own plays, all in Yiddish.     
 Well, guess what.     
 Not everyone loved our little Jewish theater so much.

 My father was there.

 Well, they happen in Pasadena, and we get along just fine.     
 But if the boys are to speak another language, should it not be German?     
 Oh, I'm being silly.     
 Never you mind.     
 Hm, Maria has known the children since they were babies.     
 She is a good woman.     
 Yeah. Yeah, she is.     
 I shouldn't have said all that.     
 I was just trying to act like a woman who belongs in a house like this.     
 [sighs]     
 I lived with a woman who belongs in a house like this.     
 I was miserable.     
 Until I met you...     
 ...I was but half alive.     
 But now I dream of everything all at the same time.     
 With you...     
 ...I am the man I was meant to be.     
 And all those dreams, they will come true.     
 You will be a strong man for your family, an important man, and the world will watch.     
 This I promise you.

 How can you sleep with that wheel squeaking all night?     
 I like to know he's there.     
 He makes me feel safe.     
 I'm scared.     
 There's nothing to be scared of.     
 [Frank] I know.     
 But I am.     
 I miss my father.     
 Can I get in bed with you?

 Fine.     
 You can get in bed with me.     
 Sorry, my hands get clammy when I'm scared.     
 Do you miss your mother?     
 Yes.     
 Do you think she still loves you?     
 Yes.     
 I love you, Tom.     
 We're brothers now.     
 And brothers love each other.     
 Don't they?     
 Yes.

 His house is very modern.     
 Much more expensive than he can afford on a councilman's salary.     
 That's family money. What else?     
 Here are your martinis.     
 He bought a new tie to impress me.     
 Of course he did.     
 Has he talked about his father?     
 No, he never does.     
 He won't even drive down Townsend Boulevard.     
 Hm.     
 Run as he might, he can't escape his bloodline.     
 He's not as foolish as you think.     
 - You think not? 
- No.     
 He's awkward and ungainly, but he has a passion for his work, for the city.     
 For you.     
 You're to be congratulated, Kurt.     
 You've done your job admirably.     
 I suppose so.     
 Does that icicle heart of yours begin to melt?     
 I bid you to remember this.     
 Your only use to me is as the icicle.     
 Otherwise you're only one more unnecessary American.     
 Yes, sir.     
 Look, the kid's just too dangerous and jumpy as the Chinaman's cat.     
 He's on our side, he's on their side, he doesn't f*cking know.     
 So we've got him hidden for now.     
 Because of this one rocket he's working on?     
 Point is, with an engine big enough, the V-  has a killer range.     
 Old Adolf can press a button in Berlin, and, boom, there goes part of London.     
 You put that rocket on a ship or submarine,     
 and, boom, there goes part of New York or Washington or God forbid Hollywood.     
 Maybe not such a loss.     
 But we need to protect that kid,     
 because if they find him and get that rocket, ball game's called on account of apocalypse.     
 So we're following them?     
 No.     
 So what are we doing here?     
 You know I have family in Germany?     
 My distant cousins.     
 I met them once.     
 They came here, and I took them to the beach.     
 They liked it. 
Who doesn't like the beach?     
 You like the beach?     
 - Sure. 
- Sure.     
 Anyway, second cousin,     
 Manny's his name.     
 Sweet guy. Lives in the Rhineland.     
 Practically in Belgium, this is.     
 Used to cross the border to buy chocolates, because they were cheaper, right?     
 That's how much it was almost Belgium.     
 Sent me some chocolates once. 
They were good.     
 And cheap.     
 So... two years ago, Germany invades the Rhineland.     
 You probably didn't know. 
No one cared much.     
 This wasn't so good for Manny though.     
 See, he was what they call a degenerate.     
 A Jew and a queer in one fucked-up package.     
 This they don't like.     
 This they cannot have.     
 So... they stuck him on a meat hook.     
 Took films of it and sent it to Berlin so Adolf could have a laugh, right?     
 On this meat hook for hours, I guess.     
 While they filmed it.     
 This is who those people are.     
 And my friends Sam and Anton... were good men.     
 And the time comes, you say enough.     
 Enough.     
 You with me?     
 I'm with you.     
 Good man.     
 How?     
 They got their big Nazimobile parked around the corner.     
 We follow them there, bang, bang.     
 Walk away.     
 Serve and protect, right?     
 That's the idea.
