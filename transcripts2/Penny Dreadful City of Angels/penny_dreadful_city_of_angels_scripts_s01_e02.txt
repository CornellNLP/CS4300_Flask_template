 You are the first Chicano detective

 I guess I should say, welcome to Homicide, Detective Vega.   
 [Townsend] The transportation committee has voted in favor of the Arroyo Seco motorway.   
 Construction will continue Monday morning.   
 This is our home!

 We have a white family from Beverly Hills butchered in some kind of a voodoo ritual.     
 Now we have a mob of Mexicans shooting down cops in the street.     
 City Hall needs this resolved, and resolve it we shall.     
 How do we do that, sir?     
 You need to conclude the Hazlett case.     
 Follow up on the victims, do any f*cking thing you want, but bring me a Mexican head on a plate.     
 Any Mexican head?     
 Just to be clear, you want us to conclude the Hazlett case, not solve it?

 What's it matter, Alex?     
 After today, it's too politically sensitive.     
 No one will touch it, and I go back to zoning goddamn crosswalks in Torrance.     
 Forgive me for saying so, but four dead police officers isn't just a tragedy.     
 It's an opportunity.     
 The people of this city are terrified right now.     
 They're locking their doors and turning out their lights, scared their gardeners are gonna hack 'em to pieces with their machetes.     
 What the people need is a champion... to defend their interests, to be their voice, to channel their fear and anger into something constructive.

 His passing was a great loss to the temple.     
 Uh-huh.     
 Did he have some kind of job here?     
 Why do you inquire?     
 It's a simple question, ma'am.     
 He was a deacon in our organization and had various obligations commensurate to that position.     
 - Such as? 
- He was one of our bursars.     
 One of the money guys. 
Must have been a busy fella.     
 Without the donations of the faithful, we could not carry out our good works.     
 I'm all for good works.     
 Detective, I don't know what more I can say.     
 Mr. Hazlett was a valued member of the church.     
 There's nothing more to add.     
 Did he have an office here?     
 Well, he has a construction business downtown.     
 But did he have an office here for his bursarial work?     
 Yes, but the public is not allowed back there.     
 Now, if you will excuse me...     
 Then how about you just show me, just real quick?     
 My partner will stay here.     
 I just need to take a gander at his things, got to be thorough, dear.     
 You wouldn't believe all the forms I have to fill out back at the station.

 These three guys are in this French Foreign Legion fort in the middle of the desert, and all these Arabs are about to attack.     
 All the other soldiers are already dead, right?     
 So they put the dead bodies around the fort so the Arabs will think that there's a shitload of them defending the place.     
 It's a con, right?     
 That's what this case is.     
 The bodies all painted up and left in the LA River, the Mexican crap, the words written in blood on the f*cking wall...     
 Come on. It's all too much.     
 It's fake.

Who has something to gain?     
 Who wanted Hazlett dead?     
 Something to do with the money?     
 Five will get you ten.

 Mrs. Gloria West.

 The city of Los Angeles has never lost four police officers in a single day.     
 The animals that assassinated Officer West and his brothers must be brought to justice, for this city can no longer live under the shadow of their anarchy.     
 They fired first.     
 They shot our boys down in cold blood.     
 They had no mercy, and we can show none to them.

 And what was the cause?     
 Why did they kill Officer West?     
 Why did they leave Nicholas without a father?     
 Not for money, not for food.     
 They did it because of a road... a motorway they don't like.     
 Well, I say that very road must now be a symbol of something larger.     
 It is our golden pathway to the future, and no pack of dogs will stop it.     
 Tomorrow I will introduce a motion in the City Council to rename it the Maynard West Memorial Motorway.     
 For Officer West, for all of us...

 Sister Molly.     
 My name is Detective Santiago Vega.     
 I'd like to ask you a few questions, if I can.     
 Oh. Uh...     
 Of course. M-may I continue?     
 Yes, ma'am.     
 I'm here about James Hazlett. 
You knew him, I understand.     
 That's right.     
 He is, um...     
 [clicks tongue] 
 Was  a deacon at our temple.     
 A fine, tall man.     
 I feel his loss greatly.     
 He was involved in the finances, wasn't he?     
 [Sister Molly] I believe so.     
 Uh, my mother oversees that part of the business.     
 I do other things.     
 Yes, I-I know that. 
I saw you earlier today.     
 [dish clinks]     
 How was I?     
 Uh, great, and the songs were great.     
 Everyone likes the tunes.     
 [plates clattering gently]

- Hmm?     
 Mr. Hazlett... you said he was "a fine, tall man."     
 I-I meant tall as in upstanding.     
 That's what I meant.     
 Hmm.     
 Did you know him well?     
 Oh, not especially.     
 Um, we had dinner at his house once last year.     
 Oh, no, um, it was the year before, my mother and I.     
 But I found it's difficult getting too close to the parishioners.     
 Why's that?     
 - [dish clangs] 
- They become attached.     
 Did Mr. Hazlett?     
 [laughs]     
 No.     
 He was always very levelheaded.     
 Even-keeled, I'd say.     
 But as I say, uh, we don't like to get too friendly, lest they become attached.     
 Aren't they attached to you anyway, your parishioners?     
 Well, to the temple, not to me.     
 I'm "that woman on the stage" or "that voice on the radio."     
 Otherwise I don't really exist. 
[chuckles]     
 Hey, fella, get back to the truck.     
 No, it's fine.

 You are a detective.

 My life is...     
 Well, it's busy.     
 I tour, I do the radio show, and record the songs.     
 But I didn't get into it for all that.     
 My calling is pastoral. 
I-I just want to help people.     
 Same reason you chose to join the police force, I suppose.     
 I guess so.     
 But you're not sure?     
 No, I'm sure.     
 I didn't have much of a choice, really.

 What do you have against Bette Davis?
