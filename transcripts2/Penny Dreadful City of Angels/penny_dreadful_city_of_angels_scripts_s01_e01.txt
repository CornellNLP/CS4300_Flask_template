 The city council has approved the recommendation.

 I was born in Los Angeles County Hospital,     
 Mr. Townsend, as I believe were you.     
 Don't you dare bandy words with me.     
 You would build a motorway that cuts through the heart of Belvedere Heights... through the house where my mother lives, through her kitchen, through the shops and the cannery     that are our jobs, all so that you could drive to Pasadena with no stop signs.     
 What, sir, would you say if I was to put a motorway

 [LIGHT LAUGHTER]     
 My name is Peter Craft.     
 And I live not too far from here.     
 I have two boys.     
 Tom and Trevor, they are called, and I will do anything to keep them safe.     
 So if there's a fight down the street, I keep my boys out of it.     
 Why should their noses get bloodied in someone else's fight?     
 Hmm? What is it to do with us?     
 This country has a duty to keep its children safe too.     
 And yet I hear so much talk about America going down the street and getting involved in someone else's fight.     
 Surely, Europe is Europe and America is America.     
 Why should we throw our children into the quarrels of nations so many miles distant and so very alien to us?     
 What has it to do with America?

 I am Richard Goss of the building-architecture firm, Goss and Ossenberg.     
 How do you do?     
 Mr. Goss.     
 [CLICKS TONGUE]     
 Thanks for meeting here.     
 Our dear Alex thought discretion was advisable.     
 And why's that?     
 A gift from the Fuehrer.     
 My firm is doing some work on the Reich Chancellery, making everything more... monumental.     
 We've also done much work on the autobahn, the motorways of Germany, this is, for many years now.     
 Oh, I get it.     
 You wanna start building motorways here.     
 Only we can't hire foreign companies 'cause of national security concerns.     
 This is of no matter.     
 Really, sir, what we want is to make you the mayor of Los Angeles.     
 You are a man we believe with whom we can work.     
 I'm one member of the city council.     
 That's all. Mayor is a long way off...     
 Not that far, especially if we keep the transportation committee in the public eye, get you on the radio more.     
 Allow us to help.     
 And in return?     
 More motorways for us to build some government contracts skirting perhaps some of the military's more onerous regulations.     
 What we want is a sympathetic ear, no more.     
 - For which you'll pay. 
- Indecently.     
 You see, we believe this place is the future of America.     
 What is New York but a filthy remnant of Old World beliefs filled with rat peddlers?     
 But Los Angeles... this is a place where a man can live under the sun     
 and spread his arms... where there's breathing room.     
 The Fuehrer looks here and dreams.     
 Do you know what I did yesterday under specific orders from Berlin?     
 I measured streets, selecting that one which is most appropriate for a victory parade, wide enough for our panzer tanks.     
 It's Wilshire Boulevard, by the way.     
 You got big plans.     
 [RICHARD] They're more than plans.     
 This is happening, sir, as we speak, all over the city.
