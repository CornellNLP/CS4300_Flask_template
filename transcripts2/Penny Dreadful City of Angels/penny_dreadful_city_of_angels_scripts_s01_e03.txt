 I'm Fly Rico.   
 You know the Cat? Find me there.   
 [Peter] Hello, Mrs. Branson.   
 Why, Dr. Craft! Hello.   
 [Peter] Would you like to join us?   
 [Elsa] Where is your wife?   
 [Tiago] Sister Molly, I'm here about James Hazlett.    
 Have you been saved, Detective?    
 Are you offering?    
 [Townsend] The Arroyo Seco is finished.    
 And with Hazlett dead, we got no one to build the damn thing, anyway.    
 [Alex] Don't we, though?    
 A firm with your best interests at heart.    
 What the people need is a champion to channel their fear and anger    
 - into something constructive. 
- Like the motorway.    
 [Sam] We seen him before?    
 [Lewis] Sam, you and Anton

 It was last week we parlayed, huh?     
 Uh, I had to work nights, you know?

 Or whatever the f*ck you are?     
 City's got a curfew now for you folks, as of about ten minutes ago.

 [Rico] Sorry sons of bitches cut my suave threads.     
 Sometimes the cops bring razors to slash up our clothes so we're not Pachuco anymore, right?     
 Baby, I'm Pachuco stark naked strutting down Wilshire.     
 But you're white.     
 Bite your tongue.     
 My parents are from Sevilla, in old Spain.     
 I was born in Mexico and moved to LA when I was three, so yeah, I'm not really a spic.     
 I'm a dago.     
 [Rico] They coming into the Cat now?     
 Holy Mary, what the f*ck next?     
 [Rio] Next they shoot us down     
 like Belvedere Heights-way.     
 [Mateo] That's what it was.     
 They were shooting us down like dogs.     
 They would've used f*cking tanks if they had them.     
 Don't think they don't.     
 Brother, when are we gonna get active?     
 - We have to fight. 
- Fight who?     
 - Who you got? 
- [Rico] The cops?     
 Los gringos?     
 [Rio] What more do you need, Rico?     
 They come into our neighborhood, they come into our club, they beat us up, they put us in jail for jack sh1t, and what do we do? How do we fight back?     
 We sit there stealing purses and jacking cars.     
 Where's our pride?     
 We gotta get our piece of that American dream.     
 - That isn't for us. 
- That's exactly for us.     
 You take what you want. 
You make your way up.     
 You use your brains. You use your nerve.     
 No one's gonna give us anything, Rico, so we make them.     
 First we make them look.     
 Then we make them scared.     
 We are Pachuco.     
 We are Chicano.     
 We are Aztec. We are spade.     
 We are wop. We are dago.     
 We are chink. We are queer.     
 We are everything they fear, and we go out dancing.     
 [dramatic music]     
 Easy now, mamita.     
 You're gonna scare our baby boy.     
 She's right.     
 What does a Chicano have?     
 His skin.     
 [somber music]     
 Let me tell you skin, ese.     
 Minute I was born, I was thrown out like garbage.     
 Mother's a stone junkie.     
 Daddy... who the f*ck knows?     
 sh1t, I did everything to survive this city.     
 I stole. I whored.     
 I ate the white man's trash right outside his restaurants.     
 ♪     
 Then one day I meet this man, Papa Pachuco from Juarez.     
 He gave me this.     
 Now I wear this skin with pride, with style, and I ain't gonna throw it all away on some crazy war with gringos we never gonna win.     
 - So we do nothing? 
- How do we beat them?     
 How we gonna do that?     
 We make Los Angeles bleed.     
    years ago, you know what this was, where we're standing right now?     
 It was Mexico.     
 It's our city, Rico.     
 We found it. We made it.     
 We built it. We take it back.     
 Before we hit the trenches,     
 let's get this boy fly.

 Get my friend one of these, Sammy.     
 Use the Rose's, not that domestic crap.

 Thank God you met me. 
You're so sheltered.

 Fights off scurvy, too, so that's a plus.     
 So... I'm taking a couple of days off.     
 Oh, okay.     
 [Lewis] I haven't used any vacation time in about, well, never, so I figure I'm due.     
 Where are you going? 
You leaving the city?     
 f*ck, no. I hate leaving LA.     
 But I gotta bury this pal of mine named Anton.     
 He's got no one, no wife or anything,     
 'cause he's a miserable cuss, so I figure I'll do it.     
 That's good of you.     
 Oh, yeah.     
 Me and all the wailing Jews.     
 It's gonna be a riot.     
 Right? Ambrosia, my friend.

 No f*cking scurvy in heaven.     
 [both laugh]     
 Oh, by the way,     
 Sister Molly was f*cking Hazlett.     
 It's all in there.     
 Temple records and real estate contracts from his office.     
 So he buys this love nest, in Malibu, no less, but he uses church funds, so it's tax-exempt.     
 He goes to a lot of trouble to hide it, so I figure he doesn't want the dragon mother to know, and why is that?     
 So he can f*ck the daughter as the waves roll in.     
 I told you she's a fraud.     
 - You don't know that. 
- Of course I do.     
 Only reason men hide anything is for money or for pussy, and Hazlett had plenty of money.     
 Take the valise.     
 You run it down and tell me I'm wrong.     
 Looks like we got a new suspect, partner.
