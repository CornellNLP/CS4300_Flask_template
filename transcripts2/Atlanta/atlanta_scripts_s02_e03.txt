 Okay.   
 Ooh-wee, I am fuming, y'all.   
 So I was taking my ten-year-old, Destiny, to school this morning.   
 Now, she loves that   .  radio station.   
 It's like the hits or top    hits or something.   
 This rap song comes on.   
 And it was just... disgusting.   
 It's... you okay, baby?   
 Want a juice box?    
 So, uh, I-I looked up the lyrics.    
 And the song is by this guy, Paper Boi,    
 and I'm gonna read y'all what was playing.    
 So there's gonna be some cussing.    
 But it's not my words.    
 Okay, so here it goes.    
 "Bitch, I need reparations.    
 N-Niggas tired of dancing like The Temptations.    
 Sell a dime bag or that new crack, fentanyl.    
 The same reason Prince killed.    
 My dick is like a tree trunk.    
 Baby, catch this tree sap.    
 Kicked you out the condo.    
 This ain't the place you sleep at.    
 Baby, slide on the dick.    
 You can do it all night.    
 You can be my baby mama.    
 You can't ever be my wife."    
 Here's where it gets crazy, y'all.    
 "Said no to college 'cause it's no fun.    
 Mo' drugs and mo' guns.    
 But I still might have to slap a trick.    
 Shout-out Colin Kaepernick."    
 (CRYING): I'm sorry.    
 It's just, like, this is what was on.    
 ♪ Uh, told a bitch you m*therf*ckin' right ♪    
 ♪ Told a bitch you m*therf*ckin' right. ♪    
 (LAUGHTER)    
 (WHOOPS, TRILLS)    
 Hey!    
 Oh, boy, I can't believe that single went gold already.    
 Yo, that white woman crying,    
 that was the best thing that could've happened to us, man.    
 Their tears are powerful.    
 They are. They really are.    
 Yo, I was gonna send her ass a gift,    
 but, uh, she was slick hatin', though.    
 (LAUGHTER)    
 Oh, man. Hey, y'all fellas want another round of shots?    
 Oh, hell yeah, man.    
 - Yeah. 
- Sure, man.    
 BARTENDER:     ... it's on me.    
 Not even gonna charge 
y'all for these, all right?    
 - Oh, thanks, man. 
- Thanks.    
 Matter of fact, might 
take one with y'all.    
 Oh, all right.    
 - Oh... 
- Hey...    
 White tears.    
 Oh, it tastes like free.    
 Ah.    
 Look, we got to talk about...    
 Yo. Y-You're Paper Boi, right?    
 Yeah, man.    
 Man, see, listen, I was trying to see    
 if I could kick some business with you, brother.    
 Like, I got a handle on a couple...    
 Well, actually, you know, we're kind of off the clock right now,    
 - so, like, we're just... 
- Man, f*ck you, dude!    
 I'm talking to Paper Boi.    
 Okey-dokey.    
 BARTENDER: Anyway, man, so...    
 put me on.    
 Huh?    
 Put... me... on.    
 I'm trying to get like you, you know.    
 - I need this sh1t. 
- MAN: Order up. Let's go, now.    
 Yes, sir, it'll be right up.    
 (BARTENDER MUMBLING)    
 Okay, that was... weird.    
 Man, that sh1t be happening all the time now, man.    
 It's kind of cool.    
 You know? 'Cause people recognize you.    
 ALFRED: Yeah, man, that's overrated.    
 Nah. I don't think it is 'cause, like,    
 I'm always getting stunted on.    
 I would love to be the person who can stunt on somebody.    
 You can stunt on anybody you want.    
 Hey, man, sh1t. Look, welcome to Atlanta.    
 Man, all you need is some money.    
 I don't even think it's that.    
 I once bought a homeless person a McDonald's meal.    
 He threw it away right in front of me.    
 Stunted on right there.    
 ALFRED: Look, trust me, man.    
 This town run off stunting on people.    
 Them streaming checks come in yet?    
 - Monday. 
- It's gonna be good, right?    
 It's gonna be less than you expected,    
 but more than I was, so...    
 Oh. Coolio 'cause I need that money, yo.     
 I feel you.     
 I feel... I feel everything.

 You're not gonna believe what happened today.     
 What happened today?     
 VAN: You know how we've been trying     
 to go to this Beyoncé concert?     
 This heifer Kristina goes out and buys herself a VIP ticket.     
 ♪ She asked me who died... ♪     
 That means we can't sit together.     
 And not everybody can afford     
     extra dollars for a f*cking VIP ticket.     
 And she's like, "Well, maybe I can meet all y'all afterwards.     
 Maybe."     
 She stunted on you.     
 She stunted on me.     
 Well, you know what? This weekend...     
 Mm-hmm.

 'Cause it's all love, right? 
Hey, man, I love you, bro.     
 I wouldn't hurt you. I'd never put a hand on you.

 Damn, this place is kind of nice.     
 Yeah, and it serves alcohol.     
 'Cause, you know, when you're drunk,     
 the one thing you want to do is sit in a chair for two hours.     
 - Yeah, totally. 
- Yeah.     
 - May I help you? 
- Yeah, uh, can I get, uh,     
 two tickets for  Fast & Furious?   
 Oh, regular or VIP?     
 - What does VIP get you? 
- It doesn't matter. Two VIPs.     
 - Okay. 
- Yeah.     
 I'm sorry,     
 but I can't take a bill that large.     
 It's all right, um... just use my debit.     
 Mm-hmm. Uh, can I see an ID or a driver's license?     
 Thank you.     
 Okay. I got to make a copy of these every time we swipe it,     
 so, um, are you good on tickets?     
 You got to make a copy every time you swipe?     
 Yeah, I know it's crazy. 
It's a new policy, though.     
 Yeah, but...     
 Yeah, I don't want a bunch of copies of my debit card     
 and my driver's license all around, you know?

 Give me the money back. I-I'll leave.     
 Yeah, but you already came inside.     
 You still need to pay.     
 Hurry up!     
 Oh, my f*cking God.     
 Hey.     
 We all know that the bill was real,     
 but the owner was tripping.     
 Sorry about that.     
 That was definitely racist.     
 Yeah, what the f*ck? This is supposed to be     
 a celebration, man.     
 Yeah, I know.     
 Let's just get some food.     
 No, no, no.     
 I know where we're going.

 - to run this city was money. 
- Mm-mm.     
 Money is an idea, man.     
 Look, there's a reason that a white dude dressed just like you     
 can walk into a bank and get a loan,     
 and you can't even spend a $    bill, man.     
 I mean, you need to start acting like you're better
