 Hey, yo, man, wake up. 
 Hey, man, you gotta get up, aight? 
 You gotta leave. It's getting late. 
 [bottles and cans clattering] 
 Wh... 
 What time is it? 
 It's like noon. 
 Look, the party was straight and everything, but... but now I got to clean up all this sh1t. 
 [chuckles] I mean, it's like I mean it's like I know y'all, but I don't know y'all, you know? 
 I mean, we cool, but we ain't cool. 
 [bottles clang] 
 Where is Alfred? 
 Who? 
 Al. 
 Paper Boi. 
 Oh, he dipped a while ago. 
 You know, it's like my niggas, but y'all ain't my niggas. 
 I mean it's like I know y'all, but I don't know y'all, man. 
 [bottles clang] 
 Where's my jacket? 
 People just tearing up sh1t. 
 Somebody poured a beer in my Brita pitcher. 
 I mean it's like I f*ck with y'all, but I don't f*ck with y'all, man! 
 It's.. it's like a... a blue bomber jacket. 
 Have you seen it? 
 Nah. 
 But I did see when somebody tried to light my trash can on fire. 
 [bottles clang] 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 It's all burned up on the inside. 
 [chuckles] I mean, I was gonna get another one anyway, but... but that's besides the point. 
 I mean, it's like we boys, but... 
 But we ain't boys. Yeah, I get it. 
 Have you seen... it's got a patch on it. 
 You know? 
 Like a seal... 
 Can we hurry up and get some food? 
 I'm, like, dying.

 Hello? Hey. What's up, Al? Um, did you pick up my jacket yesterday? [indistinct speech over phone] Dang. No, I just... I just thought maybe you picked it up. Um... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna retrace my steps, try and see if I can find it. All right? All right, cool. Peace. Free Chicken Sandwich Day, nigga. Hey, what's... Listen, you owe me $10, man. No, I mean...

Okay, don't lie to me. I'm... I'm not lying to you. Look, are any of the girls from last night here right now? One of them might have my jacket. Okay, what she look like? She... she was blonde. She had blonde hair. Was it short blonde hair? Uh... No, it was... it stopped at, like, her... shoulders. Nah. Well, wait. She like a hot yellow broad? She was kind of light-skinned, but not... not super light-skinned. Okay, was she thick? Was she skinny? She was pretty thick. Big titties? Not the biggest titties. Like, they were... they were... they were pretty big, yeah. Was she tall with a fat ass? Kind of. I don't know. She... she was like her. She l... she looked like her. Nigga, them titties ain't big. I... whatever. I don't... I don't know the titty median here. I've been working here for two years, and I ain't never seen nobody that look like that. Sorry. Aight. It's cool. Thanks. Uh, wait a minute. You just gonna leave and not take my phone number for the music video? Oh. Uh, yeah. See, you think I'm playin'. I'm so serious. I know. You better call me. Okay. Told ya. [cell phone unlocks, clicks] Shots gon' make this night! Tittys and bittys and tittys. Tittys and bittys and tittys. Tittys and bittys and... no, not... [indistinct chatter] I hate shots. You know that, right? [rap music playing] Hey. What you doing? [indistinct chatter, cheering] Gotta get in the Uber! Whoo! [laughs] I got shotgun. I got shotgun, nigga. I got the front. Man. That's right, man, to the back. Aight. Aight. Hey, man. Hey, what's your name, man? What you doin'? My baby mama's cousin gonna drop me off. This nigga, man. Hey!

[hip-hop music from phone] [humming] Yo! E-money. Hey. What it be like? Hey, guys. Sup, bro? Sup? Thanks for waking me up this morning. We... we didn't wake you up. Yeah, I know. [sighs] I woke up at 11:30 with Joe screaming at me. Word? Yeah, he was pretty mad. Why? 'Cause we, like, ruined his house. Like, we set, like, a trash can on fire or something? [laughs] Right. Oh, yeah, that did happen. Yeah. Yep. Hey, that girl, Kim, threw that blunt in the trash. Mm. [laughs] Man, we was drunk as hell. That was cold. Yeah. Yeah, well, he's pissed. Well, so what? f*ck him, man. I can barely remember last night, man. Well, you don't need to. You Snapchatted the whole thing. Uh, yup. How else we gonna let niggas know how we livin' out here? [chuckles] Most of this rap sh1t is appearances, right? Yeah, appearances of money. Look, we need to start stuntin' on niggas more. All right? That's what we need to do, bro. Stunting's a kind of a trap. We should probably make a little bit more money before we start showing it off. Oh, my God, man. How you suck the fun out of everything. See, that's... that's black people's number one problem. Man, they don't know how to have fun. I really disagree with that being black people's number one problem. See how he goes? You know what I think? I think if we spent the time we spend thinking about not spending money, spent that time on spending money, then it'd be time well spent. But all the rest of that... you know, I... Here, let me see your phone. I need to contact that Uber driver from last night. I think he's got my jacket. Thanks. Don't flip through my photos, man. Let me get some of them, man. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Speaking of money, how you think these sunflower seed companies make money? They're only 75Â¢ a pack. Hey. Um, yeah, this is, uh, a customer of yours from last night. Uh, yeah, I think... yeah, the rappers. The rappers. I think I left a... a jacket in there? It's a... it's like navy blue bomber. And now they're coming out with all of these different flavors. You got barbecue. Yeah, check, please. Thanks. Teriyaki. Mmm. Sushi. Sushi, nigga? Catfish. You got all kinds of different brands. I don't know if I want no sushi seeds, man. No, they're delicious. Sushi sunflower seeds? Yeah, yeah. Hey, why you didn't get those? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, thanks. Yeah, I'm... Yeah, I was looking all over for it. Uh, could you bring it to, uh, 24... Don't really support sushi. I think it's a bigger issue... Uh, all right. Than people talk about. But how is it... wait, man. Yeah, okay. It's not like they killing the sushi and putting them in the seed, bro. Oh, so that's artificial? That's artificial. All right. Hmm. Yeah. Bye. Damn it. Mind... mind blowing, man. I wonder why the... there's... it's not real sushi. It's all right, man. It's okay. 
 
 Found my jacket. both : Hey! Brap! He wants me to pay $50 to drop it off. Damn. Wait, Fidel from last night? Yeah. F-money? Ooh, these Uber niggas is ruthless, boy. I was hoping maybe you'd...

Here we go. Bailin' his ass out again. I guess. Man, you didn't even bail my ass out when I was actually in jail. What do you mean, "I guess"? I guess we're doing this again. Oh, hey, man, we can go get some Jamaican food, boy. [Jamaican accent] Oh, Jamaican. Hell yeah. The curry goat. The curry goat. The curry goat. I wonder how they catch those goats, man. Yo, where is this nigga, man? This some bull. Uh, he told me to meet him here. I don't know if one of these is his houses or what. Well, call his ass again. This negro stakeout sh1t shouldn't take this long for no jacket. "48 Hrs." All black cast. Does that even work? [chimes ringing on phone] Oh. It's probably him. Second time it's me. Hello? Hey, is this Earnest Marks? Uh, yeah. Who's this? It's me, uh, you know? Senator K. [laughs] Yeah, the rapper. You manage Paper Boi, right? I love his music. Tell him we'll work on something. Uh, that'd be dope. Yo, man, you guys should come to Chicago. Yeah, that... are you asking us on tour? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, just get ready, man. Aight, just think it. Yo. That was Senator K. He wants to go on tour with you. Wait, Senator K? Yo! That boy's music is  fuego! What, you see Fidel? No. Uh-uh. Something off. No, man. [engine turns over] What? Wait. What are you talking about?

I need everybody to get out slowly. All right, I'm turning off the car, man. I got your six! Hands up! Dude, you don't got to point the damn guns, man. Slowly, gentlemen. Turn around. Put your hands on the car. Look, my hands right here, man. Step it out! Hey, what the hell is going on? What are you gentlemen doing down here? Man, we're just waiting on our Uber driver. Open your legs. Do you have any weapons or narcotics on you? What? Do you gentlemen know Fidel Arroyo? F-money? Hey, hey, yo, yo! What you doing to my car, man? It's a safety precaution. Are you guys here to purchase drugs or weapons from Mr. Arroyo? We here for a jacket. My jacket. There he goes. Get down! Oh, take him, take him! [gunshots] Oh! Ooh! Coming in. Checking for weapons! Yo, come on. Clear the area! Clear the area! Did y'all really need all them bullets, man? Just stay there, sir. [indistinct radio chatter] Keep an eye on that bush! Suspect is down. Repeat, suspect is down. [screams] Get up! He's dead. Don't touch me! Why? [sobbing] Ma'am, it's okay. [baby crying] [sighs] Could you... could you check his pockets? That's my jacket. Could you check in... could you check in his pockets? His pockets... like, is... I left something in it... in the pockets. [baby crying] [woman sobbing] There's nothing. All right, thank you. I'm gonna ask you to leave. It's like a secret pocket in... All right. No. No. Go. Back up. Go. [sighs] Sorry about the jacket, man. That whole thing was, uh... [sighs] pretty crazy, though. And cool. Yeah. Yeah, it was a little cool. [chuckles] It's fine. I'm not even mad about the jacket. Hey, man. It's for you. For what? It's your 5%, or whatever. This is a lot. It's all yours. Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna go in the house. I ate them two blunts when the cops came. So tonight... tonight's gonna be weird. [laughs] Are you coming in? No, I'm...
