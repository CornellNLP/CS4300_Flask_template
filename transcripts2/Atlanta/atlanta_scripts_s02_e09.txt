 EARN: Yo, we should probably get moving.   
 You know, the    about to be crazy.   
 Oh, and your fit's on the table.   
 Yeah.   
 Hey, man, if you want this money,   
 we need this college fan base.   
 And, you know,   
 first it's this, then it's Spring Fling,    
 and that's $  K guaranteed.    
 (MUSIC CONTINUES FAINTLY)    
 You heard me, right?    
 Nigga, I heard you.    
 $  K.    
 You do realize I'm trying to make you more money?    
 - That's how  I  make money. 
- Look, no shade,    
 but we both got different standards of living, a'ight?    
 - Yeah, that's true, but obviously... 
- Where y'all going?    
 - Oh! 
- Oh, f*ck, man!    
 Tracy, man, what'd I tell you    
 about breaking in my goddamn apartment, man?    
 This .   almost sliced your ass.    
 (CHUCKLES) But, nigga, you know I'm staying here.    
 Yeah, but what happened to "one week," Tracy, man, huh?    
 One week was months ago.    
 Man.    
 You know what? Whatever, man. Whatever.    
 Where y'all going?    
 We're going somewhere not fun.    
 We're leaving right now. 
It's-it's... We got to leave.    
 - (LAUGHS) That's funny. 
- Right now.    
 'Cause I ain't asked when. I asked where.    
 Man, we doing a show.    
 At Statesboro. For free.    
 TRACY: Yo, let me roll, man.    
 You need security, right?    
 Look, all I need is a hotel floor, bruh.    
 EARN: We're not staying in a hotel.    
 Plus, don't you have to tell your P.O. if you leave?    
 (LAUGHS) Damn, yo, you Fulton County Police or something?    
 Yo, hold on, hold on. 
Bring it back, man.    
 What you mean, no hotel?    
 Hey, Earn.    
 You're not allergic to jicama, are you? By chance?    
 I don't... No. I don't know. Listen...    
 - Cool. 
- It's not a hotel, per se,    
 but-but I think    
 it might be better. Huh?    
 - The f*ck I'm looking at, Earn? 
- Oh, wait.    
 Th-That's the girl when both our phones died.    
 Exactly. And I found her on Instagram.    
 And guess what? She love you.    
 And she runs the Pajama Jam.    
 Okay, we can just stay    
 with her and pocket the money from the hotel.    
 Ooh. She cute as hell, too, boy.    
 You stay trying to be slick.    
 Man, I am slick.    
 Her roommate? Treasurer.    
 That means Spring Fling next year.    
 - (SCOFFS) 
- That's, like...    
 probably more than $  K    
 if I can, you know, sweet-talk her.    
 All right, man. We'll see.    
 You know, any bad bitch    
 with over  K followers, it could be tough.    
 You know, she got an unrealistic worldview    
 on how the world works.    
 She only got, like,     followers.    
 That's even weirder.    
 See.    
 Oh, found my fork.    
 - Yo, I'm ready. 
- Hey, hey, hey, man.    
 - Oh, I'm ready, too. All right. 
- Yeah.    
 Let's do this, baby.    
 Oh.    
 We're...    
 we're not gonna have enough room.    
 And we're leaving right now.    
 Nigga, I'm ready right now.    
 Yeah, man. $    for security right here.    
 - Bring all black, boy. 
- Say no more.    
 Come on, man, we're leaving.    
 Oh, sh1t, let me get my jacket, bro.

 Mm-hmm. (CHUCKLES)     
 (CHUCKLES) Can I tell you something?     
 I had a dream about you.     
 We were holding each other,     
 naked by this river,     
 and you were this beautiful white crane.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 And I was this magnificent crocodile.     
 (BOTH LAUGH)     
 And we were just laying there.     
 - Hmm. 
- Holding each other for warmth.     
 And then I ate you.     
 There was blood everywhere.     
 And then this, like, intense light     
 just shot through my belly.     
 And I knew that meant that we were connected.     
 I knew this would happen.     
 Eventually.

 - How am I the problem? 
- Man, you gonna     
 act like tonight wasn't a bunch of your bad decisions?     
 Did you not see Tracy throw a girl down     
 - a flight of steps? 
- I saw it.     
 And it happened after she threw a cup at me     
 for talking to another broad, man.     
 And speaking of which, that bitch...     
 Man, that bitch was crazy from the start, man.     
 And you knew that.     
 And you still put me in the same room with her ass     
 so you could save the same amount of money I would     
 have made in an hour or less off the block.     
 Tracy escalated a harmless situation.     
 - (SIGHING): Bro. 
- You saw that, bruh.     
 Nothing was about to happen until something happened.     
 I've been talking to Clark County's manager, man.     
 About what?     
 The f*ck you think, Earn?     
 Managing me. Actually managing me, man.     
 sh1t I could be getting,     
 sh1t I should be getting out here.     
 (SIGHS)     
 Look, you family, man, and I'm trying to ride with you,     
 but sometimes that sh1t ain't enough, bro.     
 'Cause money is important.     
 I see exactly what's happening out here.     
 It's getting colder, it's getting harder to eat.     
 I need sh1t, Lottie needs sh1t. You need sh1t.     
 I gotta make my next moves     
 my best moves, man, so...     
 Something gotta shake.     
 I don't think you're cut out for it.
