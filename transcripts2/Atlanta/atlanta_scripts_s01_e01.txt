 Nigga, if you don't get out of my face....

 No, don't do that to us. 
 No, no, no, no no. 
 I think I'm being more than fair, calmly asking for compensation. 
 So let's go, bro. 
 No, y'all staying broke tonight. 
 Well, you trying to get in the club before 10:45, which means you trying to get in before 11:00, which means you also broke. 
 Nobody's stunting on anybody here. 
 Ain't no one stunting on anyone here. 
 Bitch, will you please shut the hell up? 
 Don't talk to me like that! 
 I'll talk to whoever however I want, if you got a problem with it, we can settle it, but my car was not involved, man. 
 Hold on, hold on, man, I'm getting crazy déjà vu right now. 
 Okay, where's the dog with the Texas on him? 
 Oh, there he is. 
 That's a trip, man. 
 Yo, what's your man on? 
 Yo, worry about this mirror, man. 
 Just get another mirror. You Paper Boy. 
 You rich, right? 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 You Paper Boy? 
 You know it.

 Mucking... what the hell is mucking, Paper Boy? 
 Man, you know what it is, I explained in the hood, nigger.

 I had a weird dream. 
 I was swimming in this pool, but it was like the ocean and I was swimming with the seaweed, but it wasn't seaweed, it was, like, hands. 
 And I was swimming with this girl. 
 And she was saying if the hands grab you, they pull you down and drown you, so swim above them. 
 Hmm. That's deep. 
 I know. 
 I think it's about society, 'cause, like... 
 Who's the girl? 
 I don't know. 
 What she look like? 
 She was fat. 
 And not interesting. 
 Okay. 
 You jealous? 
 I'm disappointed in your story, 'cause you're first saying that she's fat and annoying, and then you all of a sudden turn around and you're making out with this bitch. 
 I never said we were making out. 
 Were you making out? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we were. 
 [laughs] 
 Oh, man. 
 I know you. 
 No, you don't know me. 
 Mmm... oh, no.

 You're so stupid. 
 [giggles] 
 I don't care. 
 Mm. 
 Tell me you love me. 
 [laughs] 
 Why did you just laugh? 
 'Cause you always say that, and I'm always, like, "of course." 
 Then why don't you just say "I love you"? 
 I love you. 
 [scoffs] 
 Uh-oh. 
 She's awake. 
 She's gonna kill us all with her cuteness. 
 You remember you have Lottie tonight, right? 
 Hey, there. 
 Of course I did. 
 [mouthing] I did not. 
 'Cause I have parent teacher conferences. 
 Also, I don't always want her at your parents' house. 
 She lives here. 
 I promise she won't be at my parents' house. 
 I'll pick her up after work. 
 And if you're gonna be staying here, I'm gonna need your help with rent. 
 I'll get it to you tonight. 
 What time are you coming back? 
 I don't know, probably like 11:00? 
 11:00? 11:00's a little late. 
 You, uh, taking the parents to Magic City's? Follies? 
 You know, Cheetahs is actually a better spot for that. 
 I have a date. 
 You're with Daddy tonight. 
 Mommy's going on a date with some corny dude. 
 Yeah, some corny dude. 
 What? 
 No, this is a great environment for you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 You have a nice flight, now. 
 Excuse me, sir...

 I know, right? 
 That was just rude, man. 
 Hey, yo, Compound was lit last night.

 Hey, yo, Earn.

 Gotti. 
 [laughs] 
 How you look when you high at work. 
 Van's dating other people. 
 She's gonna kick me out the house. 
 I'm also broke and I can't sign anyone up 'cause I'm not an old lady. 
 Can I go to the Caribbean on this? 
 Well, of course you can, honey. 
 I'll even give you an extra flight. 
 As long as you keep flirting with me. 
 Oh, okay. 
 This bitch is amazing. 
 That's really rough. 
 I don't know, I would watch. 
 That's more rough. 
 Hey, yo, you heard that new Paper Boy mixtape, man? 
 I heard it's coming out this Friday, man. 
 His last one was hot.

 Used to? There was a turd the size of my arm waiting for me when I got home yesterday. 
 You supposed to be so smart, you can't remember to flush? 
 That wasn't me. 
 It was you. I checked. 
 You better eat something real.

[clears throat] Cookie? Thanks. So, Zoo Tycoon... You want in on Paper Boy. What? No. Please, man. People ain't just nice, Earn. When was the last time you were nice to a girl you weren't trying to smash? This morning. You talking about your daughter, man, that's gross. No, it'd be gross if I was trying to smash. I don't want a handout, I want to manage you. Manage? You know where the word "manage" come from? "Manus," Latin for hand. Probably, but I'm gonna say no for the purpose of my argument. "Manage" come from the word "man," and, uh, that ain't really your lane. My lane? Yeah, man, I need Malcolm. You too Martin. You know what they did to him? They killed him. Didn't they kill Malcolm, too? Oh, no, they say that. But ain't nobody seen the body since the funeral. That's how funerals work. Alfred, you already Malcolm, okay? You have that already. What you really need is a silent wild card, somebody who's about the money, the opportunity, who can play both sides if needed. Oh, like Don Lemon. Fair point, let me rephrase what I'm trying to say. Oh, wait, wait, wait. It's 4:30. Oh, damn, man, we late. No. Since when? I'm doing business. Hey, you want a manager a rapper, but you can't do business hot? VH1 is hiring interns. And that sound like a joke, but they actually, they tweeted that this morning. How's Princeton, by the way? Still on that year off? Three years is a long year off. I guess. I think I know what happened. I really think you don't. Look, man, is there somewhere we can talk for real? 'Cause... I'm sorry, who is this dude? Darius, man. Man, I'm fine with talking... When you first walked in; I gave you cookie. No, yeah, I remember who you are. Look, I'm not asking for money. You should be, ain't you homeless? Not real homeless. I'm not using a rat as a phone or something. Don't be racist, man. That make you schizophrenic, that don't make you homeless. Wait, wait, not if it worked, man. No, if you could use a rat as a phone, man, that'd be genius. I mean, there's like five rats for every one person in New York alone. Everybody would have an affordable phone. Yeah, man, I mean, it'd be messy, but... worth it. Is he your manager? [sarcastically] Rappers need managers. I'm just trying to get paid right quick. Yeah, man, rap is D-E-D. Ded. [giggles] This isn't about rap. If we do this right, your kids can live good, my kids can live good, Darius's kids. I can't have kids. I'm sure I'll find out why when the time's right. When is an appropriate time to talk about my balls getting smashed? Right now, apparently. Look, I'm not dumb. You're older, you have no real fan base. You're not white and/or selling s*x. I sell s*x, man. Hey, track 28. Yeah.

Well, you not my manager, Earn. I still know people at Diamond House. Promoters. People who manage big time artists now, man. Oh, boy, you think you slick. You coming in here, acting like you saving me, when really, I'm saving you again. Nigga, I'm trying to help you. Man, nigga, I ain't seen or heard from you since my mom's funeral. And the first thing I hear out your mouth is "let's get rich." Walk, man. What's up, dude? Earn? Yo, what's up, man? Yo. Good. Did you just come from that dumpster? No. How are you? Oh, yo, I'm good, man. I didn't know you were in town. Uh, yeah, I've been low-key, man. Yo, obviously... oh, dude, if I knew you was in town, I would've hit you up with this party last night. Yo, we needed a real DJ. This dude... well, he can't spin worth of sh1t, but then he goes and he plays Flo Rida. No! Back to back. So I calmly pull him aside, I was just like, "Really, nigga?" You actually said that? Yeah, man, I had to. Cool. You know that song "Paper Boy"? Yeah, "Paper Boy" by Paper Boy. Yeah, I've heard it. sh1t's fine. Dude, the streets love it. Y'all should play it. Yeah, for real. Yeah. You guys should really play it. Uh, I mean, KP picks all the music. Well, slide it past him. I mean, KP will usually spin some records for some scratch up top. How much? Half a stack. $500? Am I buying the station? Everything is who you know. Then introduce me. Yeah, I'm gonna introduce every dude in Atlanta with a mixtape in my box. Come on. I'm not every dude. Uh, you kind of are. Look, I don't have $500. I make 5.15, plus commission. I got to pay rent tonight and my parents won't let me in the house. It's like those drug commercials, only not funny. Man, you know how niggas out here are. I mean, he usually charges a full safe. Then what's in it for you? Why am I so lucky? What's your cut? Oh, I'm not about that, I'm too busy, man. I mean, it's just business. You give me the money, I pass it on to KP. But you know, it's probably for the best. Music business is gross. All right, man, well, you know, it was great seeing ya. I'm taking over for Speedy tonight. All right? Keep it locked. What's up, my dudes? What's up, bro? Hey. Hey. That guy ever say nigger around you? Yeah, right. I'd break my foot in his ass. Right. Hey, um... what's your name? Prince, man. For real? Yeah. Hey, how late are you here tonight? [hip-hop music playing] ♪ ♪ [chuckles] ♪ ♪ What's up, Uncle Riley? Hey, what's going on, Al?

Hey, um... hey, look, I know you don't know me... my name's Darius. Um, I was just wondering, could I measure your tree? No, not right now. Not right now? That basically means no, man. Look, I got a question. So Earn want to manage me. Really? [chuckles] And I don't trust him, no offense. I understand. That's what's messed up. I don't really think I know Earn anymore.
