 Hey. Let me ask you a question. 
Did you see the news last night?    
 Them savages from Atlanta that went into that T-Mobile store,    
 drove they car in there,    
 - got away with about     phones. 
- Yeah, man. It's crazy out here.    
 I mean, it's-it's that time of year though, I guess.    
 Yeah. Crazy.    
 Hey, yo, and that reminds me, listen.    
 If you know somebody that needs a iPhone,    
 tell them to holla at me if they with T-Mobile.    
 - I got the hookup on the low. 
- Got you, man.    
 - I appreciate that.

 So what we doing now?    
 (STAMMERS) Like I said, man, the usual.    
 All right, the usual, damn.    
 Usual, gonna have the usual.    
 You don't want to do nothing different?    
 No, man. Look, I got, I got a photo shoot coming up, man.    
 - So I just... want to look good. 
- Oh!    
 Oh, you got a photo shoot coming up.    
 - Yeah, man. I mean... 
- Oh, you Hollywood now, huh?    
 Nah, man. It's just a write-up for me in a magazine.    
 Yeah. My boy done went all Hollywood.    
 It's a write-up in a magazine,    
 and they want to take some pictures,    
 so that's-that's what I'm doing.    
 Hey, you dating Kim Kardashian now? That's what that is?    
 No, Bibby, man.    
 My boy done went straight Hollywood on me.    
 - That's good, though. 
- It ain't no Hollywood, Bibby.    
 - I ain't going no Hollywood, man. 
- Huh?    
 You know what, that reminds me, as a matter of fact,    
 I'm glad you brought that Hollywood sh1t up.    
 Me and my girl snuck in the AMC the other day, see a movie.    
 We was looking at the movie posters on the wall,    
 and guess how many movie posters they got on there    
 with black people on them.    
 - Guess! 
- One.    
 - Zero! 
- Zero.    
 It's sad, man.    
 Key and Peele put a movie out with a cat in it,    
 they put the cat on the poster.    
 They dressed the cat up like a nigga instead of    
 putting two niggas that made the movie on the poster.    
 So was it a cat in a suit or just looked like a nigga?    
 It was... You know, you know a cat,    
 what a, what a nigga cat look like!    
 Okay. All right, man. I got it.    
 - It's f*cked up. I know. 
- It is.    
 sh1t's nuts out here. I'm glad somebody agree with me.    
 See, that's why I like you. You smart.    
 Smarter than a lot of them. Why I like you.    
 Oh, you got somewhere to be?    
 - Yes! Bibby, man. Yeah, I said that, man. 
- Oh, sh1t, my bad.

- Oh, sh1t. Don't worry about that.     
 Don't worry. That ain't nothing.     
 Yeah, I got the cut, the usual. Uh-huh.     
 Get you ready for Hollywood.     
 That reminds me, hey, did you see that basketball player     
 that hit all them people at the club in that invisible car?     
 - That sh1t on YouTube. 
- Yeah, man.

 Them people, them people be out there. Just come on this way.     
 We ain't going out the front?     
 Oh, goddamn.     
 Hey, fam, what your cable situation looking like?     
 - What? 
- Yeah, your cable.     
 'Cause, listen, I'm with Clear Cable now.     
 I'm working with them on the side.     
 So if you sign up with me, I'll make sure you're taken care of.     
 - You know what I'm talking about? 
- I'm straight, Bibby.     
 Well, fine. Do this for me, then.     
 Take these business cards, pass them out at your show     
 or take them to a studio or something.     
 Throw them at the crowd, whatever you got to do.     
 Make sure you pick up my loosies, though,     
 'cause them ain't cheap.     
 "Klear Cable." With a "K."     
 Clever, right?     
 Toothpick?     
    cent.     
 I'm good, man.     
 (DOG BARKING)     
 Hey. Yo, my man. Hey. 
Where your mom at, boy?     
 Where your...? Oh, baby, I'm here!     
 You a hour late. Come on, Omari.     
 Hour late? What you talking about?     
 Let's go. We're going. Let's go.     
 - Come on. 
- Wait, baby. Calm down. Calm down.     
 Bibby, I ain't got time for this.     
 - Move! 
- Baby, I'm here now. What you doing?     
 - This ain't none of my fault. 
- Whose fault is it?     
 It's his fault!     
 You always got some type of excuse, man!     
 No, this not no excuse this time.     
 Seriously, this is his fault.     
 He called me, talking about his car was broke down.     
 You know what I'm talking about? And I was on my way home to you.     
 I had told him. He said, could I help him.     
 I was like, "Nah, I got to go do the right thing."     
 You know what I'm saying?     
 But he start crying and stuff.     
 Talking about his engine.     
 Yeah, he had queef engine or something like that.     
 And his carburetor had jaundice.     
 So I then had to go and pick him up off the side of the road.     
 'Cause only reason why I did that     
 is 'cause of all that Jesus stuff you've been teaching me.     
 - You know what I'm saying? 
- Mm-hm.     
 You're supposed to help.     
 - What would Jesus do? 
- Why he wearing a cape?     
 He a magician! How I supposed to know?     
 Listen, baby, look. Look, now.     
 I'm trying to do the right thing.     
 I only did this 'cause of you.     
 You've been trying to get my life right.     
 It's been 'cause of you I'm doing this.     
 I wouldn't even help the nigga had it not been for you.     
 That's why I even came over here to tell you.     
 I wanted to thank you for all the stuff...     
 You-You done changed my life. Thank you, baby.     
 - Hurry up. 
- Thank you.     
 Come on, baby. Here.     
 My man, come on, let's get it. Let's go.     
 I ain't got all day.     
 Oh... hey. I wasn't talking to you.     
 I was talking to my man. Come on, bro.     
 Bibby, man, I know you kidding me with this sh1t.     
 I know you ain't just gonna cut his hair

 Listen, I know, but he had an appointment, though.     
 - Nigga, so did I!

 Five more minutes.     
 All right, little man. There you go.

 The water's not running.     
 I thought you said you paid the bill.     
 I did pay the bill!     
 Well, I guess I'm imagining things, huh?     
 Thought I paid that bill.     
 You're a magician?     
 No.     
 That's what Bibby said.     
 - Well, Bibby's an idiot. 
- That's mean.     
 Can you show me a trick?     
 Little man. I just told you I wasn't a magician, okay?     
 What's wrong with your hair?     
 Are you sick or something?     
 - The hell? 
- That was your trick?     
 MARY: And now the power?!

 You know Donald Trump and them biz out here.

 (CHUCKLES)     
 
 
 
 You know why it's f*cked up? Hey.

 'Cause your crazy-ass daddy was supposed

 You can save that. I don't care at all.     
 Hey, you got to explain that to your mama.

 Damn, with you skipping school.     
 You know, for the record, I never wanted you.     
 Yo, Alfred!

 Anybody else pee a little bit when we had that wreck?     
 Just me?     
 Hey, yo, Al, listen.     
 Hey, sorry about the hit-and-run thing,     
 but you know I can't go back to jail, baby.     
 I just can't do it. 
I don't weigh enough.     
 You know, I'll be somebody girlfriend immediately in jail.     
 I don't f*ck with no jails.     
 Just passing by the Atlanta pen make my boy-hymen hurt.     
 Hello?     
 Smooth, what's good, baby?     
 Oh, no, baby. I ain't busy.     
 You should've been called me. 
I got that on me right now.     
 No, I'll bring it to you right now. Don't be ridiculous.     
 I'm on my way. I'll be right over there.     
 Yeah, I'm on my way. No big deal.     
 Hey. I left something in my truck.     
 Let's get you that haircut.

 See, no problem. Looking good.     
 Ready.

 and then you almost killed me with your goddamn driving, man.     
 Ruined? Nigga, we had a good day today.     
 I took you to mentor to some kids. You're welcome.     
 And then we-we ate at that white lady house.     
 And then we hit that Asian lady from the back,

 Then we came back up here, I cut your hair.     
 I know good and goddamn well he ain't drop my money.
