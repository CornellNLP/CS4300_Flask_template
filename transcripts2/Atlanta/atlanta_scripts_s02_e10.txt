 (LAUGHTER)     
 So, do you know why you're here today, Alfred?     
 Racism. Not everybody's gonna like me.     
 Well, no, that's not it.     
 Waleed came here today because he believes     
 you stole his graphing calculator.     
 Hmm. Racism.     
 He  did  steal my calculator.     
 I know he did.     
 - No, I didn't. 
- He's lying.     
 I bought one from him.     
 It was the one that got stolen.     
 My name was already engraved in it.     
 Prove it, 'cause that's a lie.     
 This is exactly why we don't allow     
 the buying and selling     
 of any items here on school property.     
 You definitely know that, Alfred.     
 I've told you that several times.     
 Well, if that was true,     
 then both of us are guilty.     
 You'd have to write me and him up.     
 So do what you got to do.     
 (INHALES, EXHALES)     
 Okay. Alfred, go back to class.     
 And if I hear about you selling anything,     
 I'm gonna send you to I.S.S. Got it?

 I will write you up, boy.     
 Go to class!     
 Wait, so what's going on?     
 Devin has the exact same shirt as me.     
 Well, pretty much.     
 One of 'em's bootleg, though.     
 - What? 
- Fake.     
 So?     
 Your shirt looks fine to me.     
 But if it's fake, everybody's gonna roast me.     
 Forever.     
 Remember how Thomas got his nickname?     
 Who?     
 Thomas Jones.     
 Doo-doo Jones.     
 Oh. Yeah.     
 Well, is your shirt fake?     
 I don't know.     
 Doesn't seem like a big deal to me.

 Gonna be major differences

 The cell walls, for instance.     
 So, when we're looking under the microscope,     
 we are going to locate     
 the key differences.

 Denisha, sit up. You can't sleep here.     
 My head hurts.     
 MRS. BANKS: Remember you said you were going     
 to do some work today?     
 DENISHA: So?     
 Everybody, go ahead and break into your lab groups.     
 Denisha, do we need to go and talk outside?     
 No.     
 We talked about this at the meeting.     
 Are we gonna have a good day today?     
 I don't know. Are we?     
 This one's a plant cell.     
 Are you sure? I couldn't tell.     
 There's a chloroplast in there.     
 Hmm, I thought that was a mitochondria.     
 You're pretty smart, Earn.     
 RACHAEL: Look at this one.     
 The thing on the right is a vacuole, right?     
 I think so.     
 Last one.     
 Yeah? Let me see.     
 You got a thread on your shirt.     
 Um... it's an animal cell.     
 All done.     
 Hey, yo, is that him? 
That's him. Come on, come on.     
 - Come on, come on. 
- Oh, sh...     
 - Hold up, hold up, hold up. 
- Yo, yo, yo.     
 (BOTH LAUGHING)     
 Oh, sh1t. Look at this.     
 Nigga, where did you get this fake-ass FUBU from?     
 A thrift store?     
 My shirt's not fake. I got it at a regular store.     
 - (LAUGHS) 
- How much it cost?     
 I don't... My mom bought it for me.     
 BOTH: Oh!     
 - Come here, come here. 
- Hold on.     
 Look at him trying to hide his fake shirt.     
 Don't try and hide that sh1t now. It's too late, nigga.     
 My shirt's not fake.     
 Uh, I don't know, man. 
It looks fake to me.     
 Hey, this nigga ain't got on FUBU.     
 - He got "FEBE."

 What's up? You got that homework?     
 Left it in my locker.     
 Everyone's talking about you and Devin's shirt.     
 Yeah, I know.     
 People in other grades know about it.     
 Well, your shirt is real,     
 so you ain't got nothing to worry about.     
 Everybody's gonna roast the hell out of Devin, though.     
 It's gonna be bad. You can't wear no fake sh1t here.     
 Nobody knows whose shirt is fake.     
 Johnny's not even here.     
 Yeah, he is. He came in late,     
 but he was in Ms. Wells' class with me. He's here.

 - Oh, yeah, man, that's weird. 
- Yo. You got to help me.     
 Why? What's wrong?     
 It's my shirt. Somebody has the same one as me     
 and now everybody's saying one of us has a fake shirt.

 - What are you doing? 
- Nothing.     
 - I was trying to be cool.

 (DOOR OPENS)     
 Everyone, please settle down.     
 I came to let you all know something very serious.     
 Your classmate, Devin Myers, committed suicide last night.     
 (CHRIS LAUGHS)     
 We're not sure why,     
 but we've heard a couple of things.     
 It seems Devin's parents had just gotten divorced,     
 and he was dealing with it pretty hard.     
 Now, if anybody needs to talk about what happened,     
 please visit Mrs. Lindell in the counselor's office.     
 Mrs. Banks or any other teacher will write you a pass.     
 Thank you, Mrs. Banks.     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 MRS. BANKS: I think it's good to remember     
 that we all have     
 personal things going on in our life     
 that other people may not know about.     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 So...     
 - Hi, Mrs. Banks. 
- Oh, hello, Denisha.     
 MRS. BANKS: But... let's try to be

 - (CHUCKLES) Hey, Earn. 
- Hey, Auntie.     
 GLORIA: I got a call from the school.     
 One of your classmates died.     
 - Yeah, Devin. 
- Hmm.     
 - Did you know him? 
- Kind of.     
 That's so sad. She seemed to think     
 maybe some of the older boys were messing with him.     
 You better say something if somebody tries harassing you.     
 People will bully you your whole life if you let 'em.     
 - Yeah, they will. 
- You got to stand up for yourself.     
 Mm-hmm, and you and your cousin     
 got to look out for each other.     
 You guys look out for each other, now.     
 Boy, get your feet out that chair.

 - You ready? 
- Yeah, I'm ready.     
 I'm gonna lay out a suit for you,     
 so you'll need to add a black belt.     
 A suit? Why I got to wear that?     
 Because I said so.     
 You want to make a good impression.     
 My mother always said,     
 "You got one chance to make a first impression."     
 LORRAINE: Mm-hmm. True indeed.     
 But it's gonna be all hot...     
 GLORIA: I don't care.     
 You are a black man in America,     
 and when you meet people, you need to look good.     
 Your clothes are important.     
 That's true, Earn. You need to wear the suit.     
 GLORIA: Oh, and I got you another one     
 of those FUBU shirts.     
 It was on sale.     
 Don't say I never did anything for you.
