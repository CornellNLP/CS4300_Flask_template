I hate the club; I hate... people at the club, I hate... This sh1t is pointless, it's like a money suck. Can I give you some advice? Sure. Leave. No one is keeping you here. But if you're at the club, that means you deep down want to be at the club. You're not special. To be fair, you don't look the usual type. What's the usual type? That guy. Excuse me, sir. Sir. You need to move up out of here. We don't do that in here. [scoffs] [scoffs] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... so you hit his car? Uh, yeah. No... I had to. So then I go back and sit in my car... Mm-hmm. and I'm crying. Well, fake crying. [cracks up] [both laugh] And the guy comes up to me and he's like, [as man] "Damn, I was gonna let you go, baby girl, but my car's f*cked up!" Oh, no. No... no, you know what? Whatever to that nigga, man. Whatever. Hey you want to get a photo? Mm-hmm. Let's get a phot... Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Nigga, hey, hey, hey, where you going, Ansel Adams? Man, you don't want to get a exclusive photo of Team Paper Boi? No, I'm good, man. Wait. Man, look. You sure? Marcus Miles got his pet peacock here tonight. And it's got a leather jacket on. That's front-page news. Nice shoes, bro. [camera snaps] [laughs] Yeah, man. To that nigga, man? Whatever man. Hell, let's... let's toast it up, man. Yeah. Toast it up. 
 
 See, he's tell them some bullshit about how VIP is at capacity but he can hook them up. See, there are four of them, but he says he only has two wristbands. See, if only two go, they feel special. They have a better time. [chuckles] Everyone needs to feel special sometimes. Even if it's some janky nigga telling your two friends they can't come in. Why do you think p0rn exists? Wow. You were Marxist until you got kind of sexist. [scoffs] Then why am... why am I here? Tell me that. The same reason everyone else is here. To feel good about yourself and stunt. [imitates buzzer] Wrong. I'm here for work. Exactly. You want to make more money to feel good about yourself like everyone else. And you're stunting by playing like, "Oh, I came here to handle business like a boss." No... no. No... Don't be an asshole... okay? You asked. [scoffs] All right, then, I guess I'll just take the check, Tiresias. You better tip. Hey, Ken. What's up, hon? You want the regular? Fire alarm. [muffled club music] That nigga called the cops on me. What? And that wasn't even the crazy part. Oh, come on. Then he goes, "Oh, sh1t, my gun", runs back to his car an stashes it in the bushes. Damn, girl, you wasn't scared? Scared for what? The cops was on their way. I straight told on his ass. [laughs] Oh, I was just gonna top you off, big dog. No, no, no, I... I can top myself off, dude. I got you. I can top myself off, man! Who the hell are you? I'm a promoter, man. Well, actually... actually, I'm a rapper from Harlem, you know. You know A$AP Rocky? Well, I don't know any of them, but... I went to school with Janice. Isn't that? Yo, I got... I got a CD that's about to drop too, man. I got like four followers on MySpace... [voices blur indistinctly] [club sounds blur indistinctly] [glass knocks over] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. He cool, man, he with me. Nigga, who are you? Hey. Hey! All you niggas, get the f*ck out of my section! Get up, let's go! Hey... hey... hey, wait... you... you, hey, come on. Come on, not y'all, y'all cool. Come on back here. [chuckles] Okay, girl, let's go. 'Cause Marcus Miles' section is over there with the bottles. No. No-no-no-no-no, I'm bout to get bottles right now. Hey, hey! Sweetheart! Yeah, over here. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Marcus Miles has just bought the entire bar tonight! [cheers and applause] So we will no longer be serving drinks. All : What? He owns all the liquor in the club, and, uh, I think he's leaving. [crowd murmuring] Hey, f*ck you! So... [indistinct talking] [laughs] You broke! [lighter clicks] No, I could hook it up. [R&B music over radio] Bro, what are you doing in here? I want m... [barfs] I want my money. I want my $5,000. Oh, you mean your $750? W... what? Let me explain something to you. You know what it takes to run a club? The expenses? Well, let's do some math. We paid for the flyers. And then your boy exceeded his alcohol order limit. [gags] And then we had to pay for extra security because Paper Boi's a thug. And that's not cheap. And then, he was supposed to perform. What? No. Yeah. He was supposed to perform. So all in all, you guys get $750. And that's me being nice. Nigga, that wasn't the deal, man... Hey, don't start that with me, m*therf*cker, 'cause I don't play that sh1t. That's what I'm paying you. Now, you better check your tone and get the f*ck up out of my office before I go get the heater. ♪ I don't care. No one to love me ♪ 
♪ I don't care. No one to think of me ♪ 
♪ I don't care. No one ♪ Damn, this sh1t lame. [scoffs] It ain't even 2:00 a.m. yet. Yeah, this is so wack. [chuckles] [sighs] But at least it wasn't a complete loss. I met a cool-ass nigga. Me? Well, hold up, okay? Hold up, baby. [phone rings] [video game playing over TV] Yo. Hey. Hey, man, were you go? We leaving. Yo, I'm already at the crib, bro. What? Mm-hmm. I guess I had on the wrong color wristband or something. Now I'm on this Zoo Tycoon. Nigerians, man. Hey, hey, Janice... hey. Hey, man, let me call you back, all right? Yep. [slurps] Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey, baby. Hey, wait, wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. Let's exchange information or something. Yeah. You can follow me on Instagram. Come on. Well, I have a boyfriend. [laughs] Wait, what? Oh. That's so sweet. I'm for real gonna check out your music on SoundCloud. Come on. Are you serious? [sighs] A boyfriend? So you been wasting my time this entire night then? Wasting your time? Wait... We had a good time, right? That's why you came here. To party with cute girls like me and have a good time. We did that. Yo, what the f*ck! [groans] Hey... hey, man. Hey, where you been? Look, we need to get out of this club before I punch somebody in the face. Man, you get our money? Earn. Man, he f*cked us, man, like he... He only gave us $750, man. I'm sorry, man... I just don't scare people like you, man. Like, niggas know I drink juice and sh1t. f*ck that! We getting our f*cking money, man. What's up, Earn? Nigga, what's up, Swiff, what are you doing here? You know sweaty-ass Tony, it's that nigga birthday man. Ah, no, nigga ah... Let's go! [Baby Huey's "Hard Times" plays] Okay, this nigga in my ear. Just follow, just follow. Oh sh1t. ♪ Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare ♪
