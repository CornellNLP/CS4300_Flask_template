 MARTIN: Maybe you're all torn up inside because  getting away with murder didn't feel bad at all. 
 DR. MARSH: Martin? 
 No, it felt good. 
 DR. MARSH: Martin? 
 Anything you'd like to share? 
 Well, I... 
 I am speechless. 
 I mean, I had no idea we had such a Casanova in our midst. 
 Hector! 
 I enjoy making love. 
 Well, that much is clear. 
 DR. 
 MARSH: Actually, Martin, I was asking you if you'd like to share about yourself. 
 This is your first session back, and you've seemed preoccupied. 
 So tell us: How are you doing? 
 I'm, uh... good. 
 - Really? 
 - Well, I suppose I am a... 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 little worried about my boy. 
 What are you...? 
 JESSICA: Why haven't you been seeing your therapist? 
 Good morning, Mother. 
 Nice ambush. 
 I'm worried. 
 I haven't gotten a bill from Gabrielle in months. 
 - You're paying my therapy bills? 
 - Darling, I've been paying that woman for over years. 
 And let's just say, at her rates, she has nothing to be depressed about. 
 I've... taken a break from therapy. 
 What happened? 
 Whatever it is, you can tell me. 
 Even if it is sexual in nature... 
 It's nothing. 
 Really. 
 I'm fine. 
 And how is your family? 
 Incredible. 
 Both my kids are in such a good place. 
 - (GASPS) 
 - ♪  Did a bad, bad thing...  ♪ I have never felt prouder. 
 Just the life of a serial killer's son. 
 It's a psycho roller coaster. 
 Well, he's in a tricky spot, my son. 
 And there are things troubling him that he buries deep inside. 
 - Why? 
 - You wouldn't understand. 
 I married your father. 
 Try me. 
 MARTIN: Well, these feelings, um,  you know, they're-they're building up. 
 With no way to get out. 
 Mother, I know you want to, but you can't help me. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, surely there is someone on this earth that you  can  talk to. 
 He's only got me. 
 Dear old dad. 
 (LINE RINGING) 
 BRIGHT: Why are you calling me?  My boy. 
 It's dad.  How's my little hero doing today? 
 Let's see. 
 He barely recognizes himself anymore because of what he's done. 
 His dreams are a horror movie stuck on repeat.  And the only person he can talk to about it (WHISPERING): Is a narcissistic psychopath. 
 - Oh, fun. 
 - Not fun.  I think Mother is starting to... sense something. 
 She probably thinks it's sexual in nature. 
 I'm not talking about this. 
 Well, I know you're not, and that's the problem. 
 Come visit. 
 (SIGHS)   It's been so quiet around here.  Oh, and I have news. 
 Uh, as of today, I have access to the yard. 
 Oh, it's all very exciting... 
 Sunscreen, yard fights. 
 I have to go. 
 You know, it's not going away, Malcolm... 
 The guilt. 
 Take it from me.  What are you doing? 
 Setting the table. 
 (HORNS HONKING OUTSIDE) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Are these...? 
 Is this what you used? 
 (CHUCKLING): The family silver? 
 - (SIGHS) 
 - No, I'm just, uh, shocked at the sight of you doing chores. 
 Huh. 
 Hysterical. 
 It is strange, though, how little I remember from that night. 
 I remember being there. 
 He was there. 
 You showed up. 
 And then there's a gap. 
 That's dissociative amnesia. 
 It's one of the ways your brain protects you from a trauma. 
 Cool. 
 Let's talk about something a million times more fun. 
 I'm moving back to my apartment. 
 That's great. 
 Uh, did Mom freak out? 
 No, which actually freaked me out. 
 Malcolm, I am so glad that you're here. 
 Your sister has mountains of clothes to move, and I am in charge of boxes. 
 You're helping her move? 
 Of course. 
 I wanted to help her. 
 Just like I wanted to help you. 
 Okay, what is it? 
 Something's changed. 
 She stopped playing the piano, too. 
 Oh. 
 Is there still vodka in your orange juice? 
 All right, enough. 
 What exactly do you two think you're doing? 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 We're meddling. 
 Please, I don't meddle. 
 I mother. 
 This sudden interest in our well-being... 
 It wouldn't have anything to do with you and a certain lieutenant, would it? 
 - Gil? 
 - (JESSICA SCOFFS) 
 Wait. 
 You and Gil are...? 
 Oh, are you mad? 
 No. 
 There is absolutely nothing going on with me and Gil Arroyo. 
 I don't believe you. 
 - Well... 
 - (PHONE BUZZING) 
 - It's Gil. 
 - Oh. 
 Ask him about Mom. 
 Hmm. 
 Does he let you wear his turtlenecks? 
 - Ainsley, enough. 
 Malcolm? 
 - Hmm. 
 Not a word, or the NYPD will be investigating your murder next. 
 (CROW CAWING) 
 JT. 
 I've been calling. 
 - How are you? 
 - I'm fine. 
 - Hands up! 
 - Yo, I got my badge! 
 Stop fighting, boy. 
 - Busy. 
 - You sure? 
 'Cause when I say, "I'm fine," I'm always lying. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 I got enough on my mind with this creepy-ass case. 
 (WHIRRING) 
 (GARBLED RADIO TRANSMISSION) 
 Morning. 
 Ah, it's beautiful in here, isn't it? 
 Well, e-except for this, I guess. 
 - Holy... 
 - Watch it, Bright. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Restraints. 
 Holy water. 
 And the crucifix. 
 I'm not religious, but this is... 
 Ritualistic? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Look at us. 
 Finishing each other's sentences, even from up here. 
 The victim is Father Ramon Reyes,   . 
 He's been at the church for    years. 
 EDRISA: This is amazing. 
 He's been expertly exsanguinated. 
 JT: Gil. 
 This is Sister Agnes. 
 She found the body and called    . 
 I'm sorry, Sister. 
 Can you walk us through what happened? 
 I had been assisting Professor Shaw with the restoration of the cathedral paintings. 
 I was downstairs, and then, when I came up, I saw this... 
 - evil. 
 - BRIGHT: Sister Agnes, did Father Reyes perform exorcisms? 
 Seriously, Bright? 
 Well, this is  The Rite of Exorcism.  And it's well used. 
 Pretty sure this is our victim's blood. 
 So, answer the question, Sister. 
 I-I can't talk about this. 
 That's not a "no." EDRISA: Who-Whoever it was, they left a note. 
 The blood... it makes a symbol. 
 What does it say? 
 Uh, looks like Hebrew or... 
 Aramaic. 
 It says, "Abaddon." Abaddon the Destroyer, angel of the abyss from Revelations? 
 So now we know our killer's name. 
 Who is it? 
 Oh, you know... 
 the devil. 
 Look, um, you should go back to the rectory, Sister Agnes, get some rest. 
 I'd rather work at the studio. 
 Ugh. 
 This is all so... 
 Catholic. 
 Well, I was going to say "insane," but... 
 Did you know Father Reyes well, Professor Shaw? 
 Well, just in passing. 
 Call me Jonah. 
 You're not a member of the church? 
 No. 
 I'm a conservator, preserving the paintings with Sister Agnes. 
 We've been working on a Madonna and Child the past few months. 
 Did you know he was an exorcist? 
 You'd see people come and go. 
 - Hear things. 
 - (DOOR OPENS) 
 - (DOOR CLOSES) 
 - Excuse us. 
 Archbishop Argento? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Officers. 
 Thank you for being here. 
 I only just heard. 
 We're very sorry for your loss. 
 I'm overcome. 
 But we must trust that faith will help us find the light. 
 Outside of faith alone, we're going to need to see Father Reyes's records. 
 Every person he exorcised is a suspect up to this point. 
 I am sorry, but I can't discuss Father Reyes' work or share his records. 
 They contain our parishioners' confidential information. 
 You understand. 
 We do, Your Eminence. 
 Thank you. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 What was that? 
 The archbishop just obstructed justice, and you thanked him for it. 
 It's called establishing a rapport, Bright. 
 It's the way things get done, especially with the church. 
 Have a little faith, okay? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Nietzsche said that faith means not wanting to know the truth. 
 Nietzsche, hmm? 
 Kid, what is going on in that head of yours? 
 Nothing. 
 I'm fine. 
 Then give me a profile. 
 Right. 
 Uh... 
 consistent wounds speak to a methodology, and the bloodletting... 
 This killer was performing a ritual of his own. 
 Obviously, our demon did not want to be exorcised. 
 We're not looking for a real demon. 
 No, but what if our killer identifies as one? 
 They could be suffering from possession trance disorder. 
 It's a kind of dissociative disorder. 
 The symptoms present like possession. 
 How does bloodletting figure into this? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Not yet. 
 But... 
 I do know another killer who bled his victim dry. 
 Oh, beautiful. 
 Just beautiful. 
 I'm so glad you came. 
 Smells like urine. 
 Oh, that'll be the urine. 
 Shall we? 
 (CHAINS JINGLING SOFTLY) 
 So tell me, son, how are you? 
 Yeah, you're going through quite a change. 
 I wouldn't call it that. 
 Where have I heard that before? 
 As I recall, we were on a stroll just like this when I first explained the birds and the bees. 
 (CHUCKLING): Oh. 
 Oh, you were shocked at the changes your body... 
 Are you gonna help me with my case or not? 
 Oh, I can do more than help. 
 Um, after you called, I had a splendid idea. 
 Now, we have so many... special minds here. 
 Why not call in an expert? 
 BRIGHT: Who is that? 
 Friar Pete. 
 An old neighbor. 
 He was ejected from his monastery for extreme views, and then went on a killing spree. 
 The Friar Flayings. 
 I've brought him on to consult. 
 Wonderful. 
 (METALLIC CLINK) 
 Care to confess your sins? 
 Oh, that's a marvelous idea. 
 You two should talk. 
 I'm trying to solve a murder. 
 An exorcist was killed, bled to death. 
 Our medical examiner counted precise incisions. 
 It's an ominous number...   . 
 Jesus spent days in the wilderness fending off the devil. 
 As for four... 
 Well, perhaps the four humors, considering the cuts. 
 How about Hans von Gersdorff? 
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
 Of course. 
 Hans von who? 
 Gersdorff. 
 th-century surgeon who determined the points by which a human would best be bled. 
 He goes into great detail in his  Field Guide to Surgery.  The illustrations are lovely. 
 Oh, medicine has nothing to do with it. 
 The killer is obsessed with ritual. 
 Catholic ritual. 
 Oh, I'm surprised you don't see the connection. 
 Well, they used to go hand-in-hand. 
 FRIAR PETE: For centuries, exorcisms were prescribed to patients suffering from the bubonic plague, mental illness, lead poisoning. 
 Guys, the victim didn't die years ago. 
 There's no connection between exorcism and medicine today. 
 FRIAR PETE: Not true. 
 Today the church can't perform its rite without permission. 
 MARTIN: Well, isn't that helpful? 
 Permission from whom, Friar Pete? 
 A physician, Dr. 
 Whitly. 
 (CROW CAWING) 
 So, can you believe Gil got the archbishop to open up his files? 
 A Catholic neurologist recommended his patient see Father Reyes as a last resort. 
 This isn't about evil. 
 It's about a sickness. 
 The doctor said his patient Norman is untreatable... 
 Violent, disturbed and possessed. 
 Sounds plenty evil to me. 
 (CROW CAWING) 
 How long has Norman lived up here, ma'am? 
 Five years now. 
 He wanted his own space. 
 We agreed it was for the best. 
 Does he take any medication? 
 Not anymore. 
 Norman? 
 It's Mother. 
 You have visitors. 
 Can they come in, Norman? 
 NORMAN: All right, Mother. 
 Whatever you do... 
 stay inside the lines. 
 (OVERLAPPING, EERIE CHATTER IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) 
 (PLAYING EERIE, SLOW HYMN ON PIANO) 
 (DOOR CREAKING) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (FLOORBOARD CREAKS) 
 Hi, Norman. 
 I'm Malcolm,     and this is JT. 
 What's up, man? 
 (PLAYS JARRING CHORD) 
 Mother said you were coming. 
 Good. 
 We're trying to find out who killed Father Reyes. 
 Do you know anything about that? 
 When was the last time you saw each other? 
 Last week. 
 He came to the house. 
 Do you ever go and see him? 
 If I lived up here, I'd sneak out that window all the time. 
 No. 
 No, there's no salt out there. 
 Father Reyes told me I had to stay... here. 
 The salt keeps him out. 
 Who? 
 NORMAN: The demon. 
 Father Reyes shouts at him, but still... 
 ...he finds me. 
 What does Father Reyes shout? 
 "The power of Christ compels you!"   
 Excuse me. 
 I have to practice. 
 He's got to be the guy, right? 
 - I'm not sure. 
 - Are you seeing what I'm seeing? 
 Norman believes he's possessed. 
 Okay, he's clearly mentally ill, but he doesn't leave this house. 
 He won't even cross an inch of salt. 
 I wonder what would happen... 
 Dude, you heard the lady. 
 Don't. 
 I have to test him. 
 I have to cross this line. 
 No, you really don't, Bright. 
 - Bright... 
 - (WOOD CREAKING) 
 NORMAN: Do you have a favorite hymn? 
 I know "You Are Near"... 
 See? 
 Nothing happened. 
 ..."There Was a Fountain Filled with Blood," "Hail Mary: Gentle..."   
 I knew it was you. 
 (LOW-PITCHED): You're a demon. 
 (CHUCKLES): Uh... 
 No, Norman. 
 I'm not a demon. 
 I could smell it on you the moment you walked in. 
 You are like me. 
 That's why you came here. 
 JT: Bright. 
 What do you mean, I'm like you? 
 You're a killer, too. 
 I did it. 
 I killed him. 
 - Bright, step back. 
 - (GUN CLICKS) 
 - It's okay. 
 - (PANTING) 
 Why did you kill Reyes? 
 NORMAN: He wanted it out, but it doesn't want out. 
 He's in my blood. 
 He's in your blood. 
 (SHOUTING) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 (ELECTRICAL CRACKLING) 
 JT: Malcolm Bright, always crossing the line. 
 JT called from the hospital. 
 Norman's sedated. 
 Does he remember confessing? 
 Probably not. 
 Norman suffers from recurrent identity disturbances, voice changes, memory loss. 
 Okay, now, what the hell do you have? 
 Hmm? 
 JT told us what happened. 
 You provoked Norman. 
 I provoked Norman to test a theory. 
 GIL: That he's the killer? 
 Norman ticks a lot of boxes. 
 Father Reyes performed exorcisms on him for a year. 
 That's plenty of time for him to learn that Aramaic. 
 And time to develop motive. 
 It tracks. 
 - It doesn't. 
 - Are you serious? 
 JT said the guy went full Linda Blair. 
 That's the problem. 
 When I crossed the line of salt, it triggered Norman. 
 He became frenzied, out of control. 
 Father Reyes's murder displayed total control. 
 -    precise incisions. 
 - BRIGHT: Right. 
 If Norman was triggered by Father Reyes' exorcism, he couldn't perform the bloodletting. 
 So we're looking for a possessed person with a steady hand? 
 How does somebody learn medieval bloodletting? 
 BRIGHT: I know that. 
 They read the manual. 
 What the hell is this? 
 My father gave it to me. 
 Hans von Gersdorff's  Field Guide to Surgery,  from     . 
 It's the how-to for the system of bloodletting our killer used. 
 He must have read it. 
 I-I know it sounds insane. 
 DANI: For this case? 
 Not really. 
 I mean, I interviewed a nun who knows Aramaic. 
 Maybe she knows something about this, too. 
 (SIGHS) 
 There it is, all packed and ready to go. 
 I couldn't have done it without you. 
 Aw, well... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 What now? 
 We could order dinner. 
 - Watch a movie, mix a cocktail? 
 - I think we should talk. 
 The moving, the meddling. 
 When you're upset, you keep busy. 
 - You're distracting yourself. 
 - Oh, that's absurd. 
 What on earth would I have to distract myself from? 
 Gil. 
 I checked your phone. 
 Seven missed calls from him? 
 I... 
 I can't believe you. 
 Okay, I-I shouldn't have snooped. 
 But something is clearly going on, and we're just not gonna talk about it? 
 - We are WASPs. 
 It's what we do. 
 - (SIGHS) 
 Mom. 
 But you like Gil. 
 Just talk to him. 
 (SIGHS, GROANS) 
 I will. 
 After I have one final night with my very wise daughter. 
 - (GLASSES CLINK) 
 - (LAUGHS SOFTLY) 
 Sister Agnes? 
 - Yes? 
 - Sorry to interrupt. 
 The archbishop said we could find you here. 
 Are you familiar with this book? 
 I, uh, don't think so. 
 Why? 
 I think the killer was using it for inspiration. 
 They believed that Father Reyes had evil in him. 
 You're troubled. 
 Prayer helps, you know. 
 Therapy, prayers, pills. 
 What's the difference? 
 God. 
 Whatever burdens you, give it to him. 
 He will carry it for you. 
 No one can carry this. 
 GIL: Bright? 
 Over here! 
 Ainsley? 
 - What are...? 
 - You have to tell them, Malcolm. 
 - Tell them what? 
 - What you did. 
 You can't keep it a secret. 
 They'll find out. 
 They're detectives. 
 We have to fix this. 
 You know what Dad would do. 
 No. 
 Not like that. 
 - Not again. 
 - You have evil inside you. 
 Use it! 
 Oh, I was, um... 
 asleep. 
 Yeah, we noticed. 
 Why are you wearing body armor? 
 Because you fell asleep. 
 Your nightmares are... 
 kind of epic. 
 Yeah. 
 Tell me about it. 
 You give any thought to whether you want to make a statement? 
 I'm thinking I... wait a beat. 
 You know, let things... 
 shake out. 
 What things? 
 Look, I know you've got my back. 
 But what about them? 
 You think they'll play nice if I file a grievance about a fellow cop? 
 I'm about to be a father, and I'm already looking over my shoulder now. 
 If I escalate this, who's to say things don't get worse? 
 Do you think I'm wrong? 
 Can I be straight? 
 I don't know. 
 Nothing about this is right. 
 You good, boss? 
 Been checking that phone extra today. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Sometimes you got to wait. 
 See how things play out. 
 Thanks for driving me home. 
 Can't believe I fell asleep. 
 You're welcome. 
 Though you might want to work on your light reading choices. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 The book... 
 was not in my dream. 
 That nun was. 
 Sister Agnes. 
 Which was weird. 
 Are you sure you're not into this religious stuff? 
 Could've fooled me. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Come on. 
 No one captures the destitution of the soul like Goya. 
 It's creepy, Bright. 
 Well, Goya... 
 was actually quite the romantic. 
 Of course, he went insane. 
 All the best artists did. 
 Their work destroyed them. 
 Are you any different? 
 You've been on edge lately, even for you. 
 You want to talk about it? 
 I'm fine. 
 Really. 
 Hmm. 
 How about you? 
 It's bad out there. 
 It's always bad. 
 Difference is people are paying attention. 
 It's like they just realized that the world is racist and cops target black people. 
 JT and me don't get a pass. 
 I swear this job is gonna kill me. 
 Like your painter. 
 Who, Goya? 
 Well, the job didn't kill him. 
 It was the lead in the paint. 
 What is it? 
 Lead poisoning. 
 From the paint. 
 It causes dementia... 
 paranoia... 
 symptoms that manifest like possession. 
 Sister Agnes and the professor, they're restoring old paintings. 
 
 
 
 We have to get to the cathedral now. 
 Archbishop Argento? 
 I can't believe you're here. 
 We were just about to call. 
 - What happened? 
 - It's Sister Agnes. 
 She didn't... 
 she didn't show up for work today. 
 Professor Shaw, the Madonna that you've been restoring, are you in contact with lead white paint? 
 Yes, but we wear masks and gloves. 
 I... 
 Why? 
 I don't understand. 
 Sister Agnes could be suffering from paranoid delusions brought on by lead poisoning. 
 She thinks she's possessed. 
 (NEARBY BANGING) 
 What was that? 
 It came from the crypt. 
 But we're the only people here. 
 Bright, stay with them. 
 Dani, JT, you're with me. 
 Let's go. 
 ♪     (NEARBY BANGING) 
 (LOUDER BANGING) 
 Jonah? 
 She's going to be okay. 
 I taught her. 
 I taught her how to handle the paint. 
 I-I did. 
 Call for backup. 
 This is Detective Tarmel. 
 We need backup at Mott Street. 
 Do you copy? 
 Come in. 
 OFFICER (OVER RADIO): Who is this?   
 Tarmel, Major Crimes. 
 OFFICER: This is a police channel.   
 Impersonating a cop is a finable offense,   Detective Tarmel.   
 Lead poisoning. 
 I didn't expect that. 
 Poor Agnes. 
 Tell me, Your Grace. 
 Do exorcisms ever work? 
 In some cases, yes. 
 Although... 
 I don't take you for a believer. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I wish. 
 I really do. 
 To say, "The power of Christ compels you," and what's wrong disappears? 
 Would make my life so much easier. 
 Nothing's ever easy. 
 Forget the prayers and the rites. 
 Priests spend most of their time listening. 
 Anything you want to discuss? 
 JONAH: I told her to use the mask, wear the gloves. 
 Use the mask, wear the gloves. 
 Use the mask... 
 Boss. 
 (NEARBY BANGING) 
 - (MUFFLED MOANING) 
 - It's okay. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 (MUFFLED SOBBING) 
 Sister Agnes, who did this to you? 
 Told her, told her, I told her. 
 I told her. 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 Is that the painting they've been working on? 
 ARGENTO: Yeah. 
 He ruined it. 
 It's Jonah. 
 He's the one poisoned by the paint. 
 (MUTTERING) 
 Don't. 
 - Huh? 
 - You need to go. 
 I'll keep an eye on him. 
 - Okay. 
 - Father? 
 Lock the doors behind you. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 (LINE RINGING) 
 Mr. 
 David, I need emergency phone time. 
 King me. 
 (GATE CREAKS) 
 Mr. 
 David, please! 
 - I'm winning. 
 - It's Malcolm. 
 My boy? 
 What's wrong? 
 I need you to tell me everything you know about lead poisoning. 
 I found the killer, and he's hallucinating because of the lead paint. 
 MARTIN: Bravo. 
 Good work. Like all the grand masters... Michelangelo, Caravaggio... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that. But what I don't know is how to fix it. How can I help him, counteract the poison? MARTIN: No, no, no, no, no, no.   He's in a full-blown psychotic state.   You'll wind up like van Gogh's ear. No, lock him in a room and don't let him out. Got it. And what if I'm locked in the room with... - ...him? - Ah. Jonah, it's okay. You're hallucinating. All that old paint. You came into contact with lead. I'm manipulating the paint with my fingers to achieve a classical effect. I made it beautiful. BRIGHT: No. It made you sick. Made you act out what you saw in that book. No. Think you're possessed, but you're not. No. This isn't real. MARTIN: That's lovely, son. Your bedside manner is excellent. Nice and calm.   Jonah? Listen to me. There's no demon inside of you. JONAH: Oh, you're wrong. I am Abaddon! Abaddon... the Destroyer. Malcolm, you remember Friar Pete? What does it mean? Your son is going to die. Gotcha. Well, Malcolm, I don't think a talk-down's gonna work in this instance. Okay, what do you recommend? Friar Pete, in your expert opinion? Exorcism is the only way. Exorcisms don't work. Possession isn't real. MARTIN: No, but psychosis is.   Now, you may not believe in exorcisms,  but deep down, you know that evil is real. (SIGHS) You made sure of that. Okay. How do I perform an exorcism? Just repeat after me. Oh, you got to be kidding. MARTIN: Look, I know it's a crummy pla, but it's all we got, son.   You have got to commit to this. (EXHALES) (INHALES) Humiliare sub pontente manu De.   Humiliare sub pontente manu De.   Da honorem Deo et Patri omnipoténti.   Da honorem Deo et Patri omnipoténti.   MARTIN: Oh, with gusto!   You gotta sell it! Deus repellit! Deus vincit!   Deus repellit!   - Deus vincit!   - (SHUDDERS) Dominus autem misit ad infernu.   Dominum autem misit ad infernum!   (GRUNTS) I see it now. The darkness. The evil. You have it, too. What? No, ignore him. Just say the words. The power of Christ compels you! (GIGGLING) The power of Christ compels you. Repeat it. Believe it! Louder! The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ  compels you!   The power  of Christ - compels you! - No. No. No, no. (GROANING): No... No! (SHOUTS) (CLATTERS) MARTIN: What was that?  What-what happened? Son? Son?      (EXHALES) I finished the ritual. (EXHALES) (CHUCKLES) All right. Well done, team. (LAUGHS) When we call for backup, you come. You know exactly what I'm talking about. He identified himself! (SIGHS) This is bad. Don't you hide behind that. JT: And it'll only get worse. They made that clear. Every damn day for ten years, I put my life on the line like every other cop here. But those guys didn't see that. They just saw a Black man. And they put a gun in his face. The union needs to hear that. This doesn't end unless we end it. You're not alone, JT. I have to protect my job. My family. This is my family. I know. I'll take care of it. ♪      (DOORBELL RINGS)   (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) - Gil. - Well, there she is. - Hmm. - I'm glad you reached out. Another day, I would've sent out a search party. (SOFT CHUCKLE) Yes. Well... Been a while since I was here. Since we were together. Months. So much has changed. And somehow, I am busier than ever. Busy? (EXHALES SOFTLY) (SIGHS) Jess, what is going on here? We were talking. We had plans. I thought we had... a real thing going. - (EXHALES) - I know you came to see me at the hospital. You signed the guest book. What happened? I'm cursed. You overheard Dani and me. (SIGHS) But she wasn't wrong. I'm broken. My marriage with Martin, this world that I grew up in, it has sh... shattered me. And anyone who tries to get close gets cut. - That's not true. - Gil,     you were stabbed because of me. And if we were to try this, if we were to... for real... I would feel that worry and guilt every waking moment. What guilt? Jess... Jess, you saved me. (JESSICA EXHALES) Then let me save you again. You should go. Please. (JESSICA SIGHS) (DOOR OPENS) (GASPS) (DOOR CLOSES) How much of that did you hear? Not much. Just the part where you said our family is cursed. - Mm. - Dad ruined us all. - Ainsley... - Mom, no. I told you to be honest. And you were. (EXHALES) You're a little broken. And... I may be, too. (CHUCKLES) Which is why I'm not moving out. I'm staying here. With you. Case closed. Huzzah! (CHUCKLES) Who knew Hans von Gersdorff was in the zeitgeist? Thanks again for the help. MARTIN: I-I obviously didn't do enough. What bothers you, my boy? Come on, you can tell me anything, my son. Come on. Unburden yourself. (SIGHS) It's just, uh... I'm the one who decided to dispose of Endicott's body. To lie to Ainsley. Cover the whole thing up. That was me. Or... maybe it was me. (SCOFFS) How's that? You possessed me? Well, isn't that what parenting is? Your mother and I, we are the power that compels you. I mean, usually to brush your teeth or pay your bills, but you knew exactly what your sister needed. You knew how to save her. Because of... You. (SCOFFS) Because you're a part of me. Well, uh, why, yes, I am. (STAMMERS) You haven't always, uh, appreciated that, but, uh... (SIGHS DEEPLY) I'm coming to terms with it. And that's a good thing. Son, I-I'm... (DOOR UNLOCKS) Well... (STAMMERS) I'm-I'm speechless. It's not a good thing for you, Dr. Whitly. See, I know you're there now. And I can lock you up. Tune you out. Even... leave you behind. (KEYS JANGLE) (DOOR CLOSES) (CHAINS CLINKING) GUARD: Halt. You look troubled, Martin. Well... It's my son. It's been my mission these, uh, these many months to-to shore up our bond. But... What, my son? My boy. He needs me now more than ever, and there is nothing I can do in here, trapped behind these walls. I've... (EXHALES) I gotta get out of here. I've got to be free. I have a Bible study, a service for the faithful who are interested in... Exodus. Perhaps you should join our flock. Exodus. Perhaps I should.
