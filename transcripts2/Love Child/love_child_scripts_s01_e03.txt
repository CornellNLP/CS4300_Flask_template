 Please, please let me see my baby! 
 Why can't I see my baby? 
 Can you find out who adopted my baby? 
 Just remember, when you get out of this place, you keep going. 
 Don't ever look back. 
 I've been thinking about the Stanton girls and the way they're treated. 
 It's a system that works perfectly well. 
 That is rubbish. 
 You're a midwife here. 
 That's all. 
 If you want to be something else, leave. 
 Or I will take the first opportunity to get rid of you. 
 You know I just found out we have a good friend in common. 
 Lawrence Faber. 
 Bloody good doctor. 
 Speaks very highly of you too. 
 You're not going to be its daddy. 
 You won't be able to give it away. 
 I've done it before. 
 Matron! 
 Matron, open the gate! 
 What have you done? 
 I made a mistake. 
 I changed my mind. 
 I want my baby back. 
 Johnny : Join us. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Anti-war rally, next weekend! 
 Join us, Belmore Park, next weekend! 
 Get a job, ya hippie! 
 Join us, Belmore Park! Anti-war! 
 You layabout! 
 Join us. Thank you very much. 
 Next weekend. Belmore Park. 
 Let's get high together.

 Now, remember to stay calm and just tell the social worker exactly why you want your baby back. 
 It's pretty obvious, isn't it? 
 'Cause she's mine. 
 No, you need to project responsibility and maturity. 
 That is what she's gonna be looking for. Annie! 
 Hi! 
 How are you? 
 Yeah, good. 
 So good to see you. 
 You drove all the way from Newcastle in your undies for your kid? 
 Yeah. Lucky she didn't stop for petrol, eh? 
 (ALL GASP) 
 Oh, my giddy aunt! 
 Man : Hey! What is this? 
 (ALL LAUGH) 
 Woman : Oh, get away! 
 Are you for real? 
 You are so beautiful. 
 Now, there's something you don't see every day. 
 Hark! 
 What light beyond groovy window breaks? 
 All you need is love, but not from me. 
 Kiss this, Shirley. 
 Hey, hey! Bloody hell! 
 Girls, find something else to look at. Police! Call the police!

 I'm sorry, Annie, but it's just not possible. 
 You did sign the consent form. 
 Yeah, but I... 
 Woman : Willingly? 
 As I recall, she couldn't wait to get away from here. 
 Yes, but now she's had some time to think, and she's changed her mind. 
 Yeah. 
 Sister, it's good of you to be so supportive of the girls, but we do know what we're doing. 
 Annie's baby's gone to a very good home. 
 No, you...you have to give her back to me. 
 She's...she's my daughter. 
 Carol : I'm sorry, Annie. 
 But the adoption has been finalised. 
 In time, you'll understand. 
 This is for the best. 
 You don't understand. 
 No-one understands. 
 Thank you. 
 Joan : Annie! 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 You did well. 
 Next time I need your help, I'll ask for it. 
 Annie. 
 Annie. 
 Annie, sweetie, I'm so sorry. 
 I won't give up. I can't give up. 
 I know, but, darling, I don't think there is anything else we can do. 
 Stop! No-one...understands. 
 Man : Sister. 
 We'll need to transfer Mrs Adams The labour ward is overflowing, I'm afraid. 
 That social worker in there is a disgrace. 
 Well, I know she likes a drink, but disgrace is a little harsh. 
 Mrs Thomas, we'll have you into a cubicle as soon as possible. 
 Alright? 
 The system is stacked against them. 
 It's the only system we have. 
 Well, it needs to be changed. 
 Fine. Then change it. 
 After your shift. 
 How could you run around with your willie all out? 
 Viv : I liked it. 
 There has been far too much work and not enough willie around here lately, if you ask me. 
 For goodness sake. 
 Patricia? 
 Patricia : Yes, Matron? 
 You have a visitor. 
 (PATRICIA GASPS) Mummy! 
 Hello, sweetheart. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 What are you doing in Sydney? 
 Just...shopping. 
 You look well. 
 Still quite petite. 
 Is Daddy here? 
 This is from both of us. 
 A few little things from Mark Foy's. 
 Though I'm sure Matron's feeding you well, when you behave. 
 Patricia's no trouble. 
 She's one of our good girls. 
 Mother : Always has been. 
 Mostly good. 
 I've missed you. 
 Patricia, why don't you give your mother a tour of Stanton House? 
 It's a lovely old building, isn't it? 
 Mmm. 
 This is the dormitory. 
 Over here's where I sleep. 
 This is my bed. 
 Oh, Mum. 
 You must meet my friend Martha. 
 She sleeps just here. 
 Hello. 
 Martha : Patricia's our princess. 
 That makes you the queen, eh? 
 I think... No. 
 Clean sheets, girls. 
 Get them beds made! 
 They've got you in with all types, haven't they? 
 Even black girls. 
 Well, Martha's nice. 
 This place feels like a reform school. 
 Does it? 
 Looks like it hasn't been painted since before the war. 
 You can't stay here. 
 Are you going to get me out of here? 
 Well, can I come home? 
 I'll speak to your father. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 What's the word on Annie? 
 All the girls want to know. 
 No luck. 
 Mmm. 
 Well, she should have known. 
 Once her 30 days are up, there's nothing she can do. 
 30 days...? 
 On the consent form. 
 You only get 30 days from the birth of your baby to change your mind. 
 What? 
 I need to check something. 
 Joan : The wrist tag from Annie's baby. I kept it in my locker. 
 She has 30 days to change her mind, right? 
 She still has two days left. 
 Well, it's not just about the date. 
 Does she have a job, a place to live, money in the bank to support the child? 
 And what if she did? 
 Well... 
 If she ticks all those boxes, does she get her baby back? 
 In theory, yes, but all of those things need to be proven to my satisfaction. 
 And I set the bar very, very high. 
 Is that clear? 
 That's all I needed to know. Thanks. 
 Annie? Hey, Joan. 
 Oh, man, you were there too. 
 Did I really do what I think I... 
 Later, Johnny. 
 Annie? 
 Annie, you in there? 
 Annie! 
 Right. 
 What? 
 It's not all over. There's still a chance you can get your baby back. 
 What? 
 We need to find you a job. 
 How do you mean? 
 My mother has a friend who needs a nanny. 
 Looks like I'm going home! 
 I can't believe it. 
 I'll be able to see Robert again, and we can finally make plans for the wedding. 
 That's great, Pattie. 
 Get what you want, then. 
 Happy ever after in Melbourne. 
 Have your baby on one of them trams. 
 Then we can read about it in the paper. 
 Well, I'll write to you, Martha, and...we can all keep in touch. 
 Don't worry. Once we've had our kids, then we're out of here, gone. 
 You're just getting away a little bit earlier, princess. 
 Thank you, Sister. 
 I thought we had an understanding. 
 The adoption of the Carmichael baby has been finalised. 
 Not yet, though you obviously want it to be. 
 Why are you leaving the door open for her? 
 I have no choice. 
 You have discretion. 
 The hospital board would have backed you. 
 The law is the law. That adoption was not done by the book. 
 And we both know it. 
 If you open this up, you could undermine the whole system. 
 It's our job to focus on what's best for the child. 
 "Our job"? 
 Matron, if people start asking difficult questions about that adoption, the first door that they come to will be mine. 
 So my job is the one on the line here. 
 There is a family's happiness at stake here. 
 You know what needs to be done. 
 Phillip : The cops will usually turn a blind eye, but when you do it in broad daylight and in a car... 
 Look, for God's sake, don't wear that to your committal. 
 Phillip. Hi. I'm so sorry to interrupt. 
 No, that's OK. We were just finishing up. 
 Joan, this is Simone. 
 (MASCULINE VOICE) He's all yours. 
 I need your help. 
 There's a pattern emerging here. 
 Sounds like a private adoption. 
 Private? 
 Well, not through official channels. 
 But say you're in the market for a kid, you don't want to wait in the queue, all you need is a contact somewhere like Stanton House. 
 And that's legal? 
 Not anymore. 
 But you can get anything you want in this town if you know the right people. 
 Even a baby. 
 Look, could you do me a favour? 
 Could you look into it for me? 
 I just need to know what Annie's legal rights are. 
 You still haven't paid me for the last lot of help I gave you. 
 I paid you in kind. 
 Oh! So, same arrangement, then? 
 I come highly recommended. 
 No. 
 I might get a reputation I don't want. But thank you. 
 Have a seat, Annie. 
 Thank you. 
 So...did you bring any references with you? 
 References? What do you mean? 
 From your last employer. 
 Oh. I've actually never had a job before. 
 But I am... I am really keen, and I will work incredibly hard. 
 Have you had much experience with children? 
 Yes, I have, actually. I practically raised my little brother, Ronnie. 
 He's five years younger than me. 
 And I'll have my... my daughter with me as well. 
 Your daughter? 
 Yes. 
 She's just a baby, but I'm sure I'll... I'll manage with... 
 And what about your husband? 
 Um, well, he is...away. 
 Away? Where? 
 In the country. 
 Where's your wedding ring? 
 Um... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I have no interest in having a girl like you living under my roof. 
 Finally discovered our secret hideaway? 
 Worst-kept secret in the entire hospital. 
 You coming to Baxter's farewell party tonight? 
 No, no plans. 
 Your loss. 
 I hear there'll be men. 
 You could do with one. 
 Hey, listen, about Annie Carmichael. 
 Oh, not again. 
 You're getting very involved with your patients. 
 She is not my patient anymore, and the reason I'm supporting her is because I believe her to be in the right. 
 Listen. I know these girls. 
 They say they want their babies back, and 9 times out of 10, they can't cope. 
 The kids end up wards of the state. 
 A word to the wise - drop it. 
 I just spoke to a lawyer... 
 You what? 
 Yes, and somebody took that baby from the nursery the night it was born. 
 What are you accusing me of? 
 I want to know who authorised that adoption. 
 I want to know where that baby is. 
 You are so far out of line. 
 (GASPS) 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Carol's made an official complaint. 
 I'm being hauled in front of the bigwigs this afternoon. 
 It's not right. 
 They can't sack you, can they? 
 Anyway, let's just try to worry about Annie for now. 
 Now, she's got a place to stay at the Oasis, but she's going to need a job and money in the bank. 
 And most importantly, she's got to convince that social worker that she's able to look after that baby herself. 
 Good luck with all that. 
 We have to help her. 
 She's our friend. 
 She's not your friend. The only thing you have in common is this. 
 That's not true. When I first got here, she stuck up for me. 
 She wants her baby back. 
 Isn't that worth fighting for? 
 Well, what do you want me to do? 
 Help her sell her car. 
 By tomorrow? 
 Improvise. 
 Is there anything that I can do? 
 Just wish us luck, princess. 
 You're going home, remember? 
 Wait here. I'll be back for you shortly. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 
 
 
 Sister Millar, I said we'd call you when we're ready. 
 What's the point? 
 The decision's already been made. 
 We all know how this will go. 
 Let's not bother with the charade. 
 If that's how you feel, we have no choice but to terminate... 
 There's some things you need to know... That will be all, Sister. 
 ..about the adoption practices at the Stanton House. 
 This is completely irrelevant. 
 Not for Annie Carmichael. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm not finished. 
 I think you are, Sister. 
 You're having a problem with the staff, you come to me first, some bloody kangaroo court. 
 I found her in my office. 
 So what? Did she kick your door in? 
 Sorry for the time you've wasted, gentlemen. Back to work, Sister. 
 This hearing's over. 
 What was that? 
 I just saved your job. 
 Oh, I can fight my own battles, thank you very much. 
 If you think that, you're a fool. 
 I just stopped you throwing away your career over something you can't change. 
 I was trying to help a young mother get her baby back. 
 What makes you think you know what's best for that baby over everyone else? 
 Annie made a mistake. 
 She shouldn't have to pay for that for the rest of her life. 
 And how is losing your job gonna help her? 
 Look, you have an opportunity here. 
 You could become one of a ...a handful of female obstetricians in this country. 
 Isn't that something you want? 
 Possibly. 
 Well, the men in that room can stop you from even finishing your degree. 
 Smarten up. 
 I can report complete success. 
 Oh, that's wonderful! 
 Are we going to catch the train, or can I fly? 
 We hardly need a plane to cross the Harbour Bridge. 
 I'll organise a taxi tonight. 
 To where? 
 We have a choice of two hostels, both lovely, run by the Mercy nuns. 
 You can choose. 
 This one has the most beautiful gardens, but with this one, you get your own little kitchenette. 
 Uh... But you said, uh... 
 I thought you were taking me home. 
 And you will come home, after you've given up the baby. 
 I spoke to your father. 
 Mm-hm. 
 It's for the best. 
 Chin up, sweetheart. 
 I'll be back this evening to pick you up. 
 Mum. (CLEARS THROAT) 
 You heard from Robert? 
 No, Patricia. 
 Hi, Pattie. 
 Hi. 
 Shove over. 
 Guess what. 
 What? 
 My mother's going to...pay for Annie's nursery furniture. 
 What? How did you talk her into it? 
 Well, I didn't, but... she has an account at Mark Foy's, and I think I know how to forge her signature. 
 I'm starting to like you. 
 It's too bad you're going. 
 Cop! 
 (LAUGHS) Afternoon, officer. 
 Viv : What can I do you for? 
 Well, there was a report of a streaker this morning, so I'm here to take your statements. 
 Right now? 
 From all of us? 
 Well, anyone who saw anything. 
 Well... That was just me. 
 No need to bother the others. 
 Great. Great. 
 OK, well, I'll report to Matron Bolton. No, no need. 
 Follow me. 
 I'll show you what happened. 
 Yeah, but I... 
 Right this way. 
 Let's go shopping. 
 Ooh-ooh! 
 I'm sure he took off this way. Maybe he went back down Darlinghurst Road. 
 This is the short, tall, blond fella, with dark hair? 
 Sorry, the more I think, the more confused I get. 
 But he was definitely naked? 
 Oh, yeah. I could describe that part in detail for you. 
 I bet you can. I bet you can. 
 (STRUMS GUITAR) 
 Hi. Naked man. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Beautiful day. 
 Is it? 
 Hey. Um... I don't suppose anyone needs any work done around here? 
 Like, um, cleaning or laundry. 
 I need to get a job so I can get my baby back. 
 Good afternoon. 
 Hi. 
 I'm here to see Annie, not you. 
 I'm sorry about this morning. 
 Sorry for what? 
 Embarrassing you. 
 You embarrassed yourself, not me. 
 Are you sure you want your baby back? 
 Yeah. I'm sure. 
 Ever looked after a baby? 
 Have you got any idea what's involved? 
 I'll learn, just like everyone else does. 
 Shirl, she wants to keep the baby. 
 What's wrong with that? 
 The reality is not like the fantasy. 
 Ever. 
 Well, fetch your keys. 
 Apparently, we're selling your car. 
 (ENGINE REVS) 
 Afternoon, boys. 
 Do you girls come with that car? 
 If you're lucky. 
 I still don't understand why I have to be the hired help. 
 OK, if you would like to pretend to be my mother, go right ahead. 
 I would be very happy to see that. 
 I can play rich and sassy.

 I, um...I found some takers for your laundry business.

 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Is the baby kicking? 
 Is it? 
 No. 
 It's...nothing. 
 I've, um... 
 I've got to go to work. 
 Thank you, Johnny, for everything. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 You're welcome. 
 He is so nice. 
 Well, I should get back too. 
 Hey, thanks for this morning. 
 Give them hell tomorrow. 
 Get your little girl back. 
 You're gonna be a great mum. 
 Darling, where's your suitcase? 
 The taxi's waiting. 
 Uh... 
 Um, I read all the...the pamphlets about the other places. 
 They look... 
 They're nice hostels. 
 I'm glad. Which one did you choose? 
 I'm going to stay here. 
 What? 
 Well, if I can't come home with you, I'm just gonna stay here and have this baby with my friends. 
 Don't be ridiculous. Get your suitcase and come with me now. 
 Patricia! 
 I'm not going! 
 This is my decision! It's my baby! 
 Get your suitcase. 
 Let go. You don't have to worry. 
 I worry constantly about you, Patricia. Now get your suitcase... 
 No! Let go of me! 
 I don't like you! Get out! 
 And, um, give my best to Dad. 
 I love you. 
 I know that. 
 (SOBS) 
 (UPBEAT SONG PLAYS) 
 Not your scene? 
 Not till now. 
 I'm just wondering if I could leave without appearing rude. 
 Can I get you a drink? 
 No. 
 But I need to find Carol and apologise. 
 Of course. She's over there. 
 It's probably the right thing to do. 
 It's not for me. It's for Annie. 
 In any case, Carol doesn't trust people who don't drink, so, uh... 
 You might need these. 
 Come on. 
 Let's get it over and done with. 
 Ooh. Hang on. 
 There you go. 
 Carol. 
 Look who I found. 
 Don't be like that. 
 She brought a peace offering. 
 Good luck. 
 Drink? 
 Alright. 
 Listen, I'm... 
 I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have been in your office. 
 You just couldn't stop yourself, could you? You wanted that file. 
 Anyway, it doesn't matter to me one way or another. 
 I've been promoted. 
 (COUGHS) What? 
 I knew you'd be pleased. 
 I start at St Vincent's next Monday. 
 Came through today. 
 Thanks for the drink. 
 Listen, Carol, I'm... 
 I'm very sorry about what I did. 
 Listen, Joan. 
 You're lucky that McNaughton is sweet on you or you wouldn't have a job. 
 Please. 
 Please, just give Annie a fair go tomorrow. 
 You should have trusted me. 
 Joan : Annie? 
 I've done it, Joan, done everything on the list. 
 I think I can get my baby back. 
 Annie, that's... 
 That is marvellous, but... 
 Darling, it's not a certainty. 
 It's gonna happen. 
 I can feel it. 
 But I'm scared. 
 Shirley's right. I haven't got a clue how to take care of a baby. 
 I've never even held one. 
 Do you think I could have a hold?

 Excuse me. Have you seen Carol? 
 Try the office. 
 (PANTING) 
 Carol? 
 Oh! Uh... 
 When...when you're done, could I have a moment? 
 I'm a very discreet person. 
 I would appreciate it. 
 Of course, I know if there's ever anything that you can do for me, you will. 
 Annie Carmichael will have her application assessed without prejudice. 
 Of course. 
 That's the professional thing to do. 
 Thought you'd gone. 
 No. I need a drink. 
 Join me? 
 Who's up for stealing the nurses' piano for a real singalong? 
 Oh, dear. 
 You know who Baxter's gonna be working for in the UK? 
 Our old friend Lawrence. Poor man. 
 He's gonna have his hands full juggling that idiot and a new baby, that's for sure. 
 Lawrence had a baby? 
 Yeah, we should probably send a card or something. I thought you knew. 
 No. 
 Wow, a baby! 
 Yeah. 
 Well, if that isn't cause for celebration... 
 I think I've had enough. 
 Oh, Doctor, where's the fun in being in control all the time? 
 Joan : Baxter! 
 You call this a party? 
 Turn the music up. 
 Come on. You can't dance if you can't hear the music. 
 (MUSIC BLARES) 
 Joan : Quiet. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 You know what? 
 I'm not gonna sleep with you. 
 That's good. 
 So you... 
 You might as well just go home. 
 That's not why I'm here. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, no, I get it. Oh, I see. 
 No. You're here... 
 You're here to save me from making a spectacle of myself again. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 All it took was one mention of Lawrence to get the party started. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 You know that your friend Lawrence... he's a b*st*rd. 
 Tell me something I don't know. 
 I had no idea that you two were, uh, involved. 
 Involved? 
 That word makes it sound very polite. 
 I was going to have his baby. 
 His baby? 
 Mmm. 
 What happened? 
 I listened to him. 
 And he said it was gonna ruin both of our lives. 
 He made you get rid of it? 
 He made me think... that that was my choice. 
 And it was meant to make everything better. 
 But don't... 
 Don't you dare pity me. 
 I don't want your pity. 
 Let's get you to bed. 
 Where are we going? 
 To bed. 
 I love bed. 
 Ooh, carry me. I'm a princess. 
 This way. Oh! 
 (LAUGHS) 
 You know what? 
 I'm still not gonna sleep with you. 
 OK. 
 Now or never. 
 Well, never's a very long time. 
 Not for me, it isn't. 
 I intend to live for a very, very long time. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 That's good. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (GROANS) 
 Easy. 
 Everything's spinning. 
 Do you believe in happily ever after? 
 Depends. 
 You know, I think I'm just starting to. 
 Carol. 
 Mmm? 
 Carol changed her mind. 
 Did she? 
 Uh-huh.

 Of these... investigations have been launched, and 11 men have been convicted for refusal to obey a call-up notice to... 
 We've got a problem. 
 Carmichael girl. 
 You need to do something. 
 (TRAFFIC PASSES OUTSIDE) 
 Oh, no! 
 No! 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Big night? 
 Yeah. 
 I brought you something. 
 Got a copy of the adoption laws for your friend and a draft letter to the Judge in Equity. 
 You'll need to lodge it by 4:00. 
 She's also entitled to a mother's benefit. 
 It's...a one-off thing. 
 It ...it might help. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry for being so crazy. 
 (SOBS) 
 Um... I've got a bail application in 15 minutes. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 This is beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, I've reviewed your application and your living and financial arrangements. 
 And? 
 And I see no reason to refuse your application. 
 You mean it? 
 Carol : I'll draft a letter to revoke consent today. 
 You'll be granted custody of your daughter. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, uh, when? When can I see her? 
 As soon as practicable. 
 You do understand that there'll be certain...sensitivities with respect to the other family? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Well, I'll get it underway, then. 
 OK. 
 I'm gonna get my baby back! 
 Thank you. Thank you... 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm gonna go tell the other girls. 
 Ooh, my bag.

 So, we done? 
 We are done. 
 Ooh, sorry. 
 Matron. 
 Annie. I need to talk to you in my office. 
 (GASPS) Annie! 
 Annie! 
 How'd you go? 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 I don't know how best to say this, but... 
 We've just received notification. 
 Your baby died three days ago. 
 Matron : Complications from whooping cough. 
 I'm very sorry for your loss. 
 In time, I'm sure you'll realise... this is for the best.

 We're down here. 
 How was your day? 
 All the better for being here. 
 Can I fix you a drink? 
 Oh, yes, please. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Oh! Hello, my little Rose. 
 Daddy's home. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Did you have a good day? 
 Little chubby legs. Look at that.
