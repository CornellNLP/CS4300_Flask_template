 I'm Joan Millar, the new midwife. I'm here for orientation. 
 Frances Bolton, Matron. 
 You were supposed to meet me at the hospital. 
 This is Stanton House, a home for unwed mothers. 
 You are under-age, Vivian, and your parents have signed you over to us for the term of your pregnancy. 
 You run this place like a farm! 
 You don't care where the babies end up, so long as it's not with their mothers. 
 Get out of here! You're morally bankrupt! 
 Get out of here! How many lives have you ruined? 
 Please! Please let me see my baby! 
 I made a mistake. 
 I want my baby back. 
 Your baby died three days ago. 
 I have lied for you. I have falsified records, all because you needed to give your wife a child and couldn't wait. 
 Peace and love, copper! 
 Johnny, it's not going to happen. 
 We could keep the baby, your family. 
 He's very premature so his lungs are underdeveloped, but he's breathing on his own. 
 You, me, a sick baby, no money, the government after us. 
 Joined up. They said they'd waive my sentence if I put in two years of nasho. 
 You were supposed to be arriving back as a doctor. Married. 
 Where are we now, you and me? 
 I don't want to destroy your marriage. 
 In another universe, maybe things would have been different for us. 
 Shall we? 
 She's your baby. 
 You're a midwife here. 
 If you want to be something else, leave, or I will take the first opportunity to get rid of you. 
 You topped the state in your obstetrics exam. 
 Congratulations... Dr Millar.

 We need to prep Mrs O'Reilly for a caesarean section. 
 You might want a second opinion, Doctor. 
 If there was someone qualified to give me a second opinion, I'd ask for it. 
 You're still only a junior resident here. 
 I suggest you start behaving like one. 
 I'm not answerable to you, Matron. 
 In fact, it's the other way around. 
 Right. Bear with us, Mrs O'Reilly. 
 We'll have that baby of yours out safely before the year's over. 
 Aah! 
 Do you think this means he's out of intensive care for good? 
 If he keeps improving like this, he might be home in a few weeks. 
 I'm so frightened I'm going to hurt him. 
 You won't. 
 His wound is healing nicely and his blood tests and chest X-rays are all excellent. 
 You can stay with him for a while if you like. 
 I'll see in the new year with him. 
 I've got a shift to finish at the Blue Moon. 
 Alright. I'll let the nurses know. 
 Maybe we should have a drink later, when you finish up. 
 I can't. Back-to-back shifts. 
 You've worked every day for a month. 
 I'm a junior resident. 
 Where are all the other junior residents? 
 Playing cricket. 
 They've got nothing to prove. 
 Joan! Joan! Joan! Can you come, please? I need your help. Please. 
 She fainted right into my arms. 
 Did you ask for the casualty doctor? 
 They said we'd have to wait for hours. 
 We thought she was having her baby. 
 Ooh, not yet. This is going to need stitches. 
 She reckoned someone was chasing her. 
 Maybe we should call the cops. 
 No! No police. 
 Right, you two need to go before I have Matron to deal with. 
 This is hers. 
 Right, what's your name? 
 This is going to be a lot easier if I know what to call you. 
 I can't stay here. 
 You've lost a lot of blood and this wound needs to be treated. 
 Please let me. 
 Look, do me a favour - look into this light. 
 Was this an accident or did someone do this to you? 
 Accident! 
 I thought the window was open. I wanted to see the fireworks. 
 Good thing you didn't stick your head through first. Hey! 
 Settle down! Settle down! Please. 
 I told you I have to go. 
 No, you can't go anywhere. 
 I'm sorry. He can't find me. 
 Who can't find you? 
 Who? 
 No-one. 
 Alright, look, keep your hand tight over the wound. 
 I'm going to go get some sutures and some dressings, alright? 
 Come on! 
 Idiot! 
 Ignore him. 
 Listen, you just stay here, OK? Keep that tight. 
 Sorry. I didn't... I may not have been here for the past month, but the last time I looked this was a hospital, not a fun park. 
 Dr McNaughton, my father is Henry Bowditch. 
 I don't care if your father's Henry bloody Kissinger. 
 You will not treat my hospital as your personal playground. 
 Is that clear? 
 As a bell, sir. 
 Good. 
 Dr Millar! 
 Happy New Year. 
 I thought you'd resigned. 
 I did. 
 My replacement fell through and the board asked me back. 
 I have to attend to a patient. 
 Down here in casualty? 
 It's New Year's Eve. We're understaffed. 
 Well, I'm happy to lend a hand. 
 Lead the way. 
 Oh! It's so far down. 
 Hey, look up. 
 After all that, we didn't even go into the club. 
 Hmm. 
 It's not all bad. 
 Ahem... 
 Where did you get that? 
 Nurses' quarters. 
 That girl looked so scared. 
 She looked like me when I got here. 
 This time next year I'm going to be in Melbourne with Robert. 
 You'll be back in Tamworth. 
 No chance. 
 When all this is over, I'm staying. 
 Stanton House? 
 In Sydney, you dope. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I don't know. 
 Airline hostess, travel the world? 
 Oh, my baby's kicking. 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Bet it's a girl. 
 There he goes again! 
 Oh, wow! 
 Could have severed an artery. 
 How did you do this? 
 She fell out of a window. 
 You're a silly girl, aren't you? 
 That baby of your looks like it's almost cooked. 
 When are you due? 
 We should think about getting her admitted upstairs. 
 OK, there you go. 
 Hop up, and let's see about getting you a bed somewhere. 
 No! 
 Doctor, can I just have a word with you outside for a moment? 
 The girl is clearly traumatised. 
 Most people that come to hospital are. It's the nature of the place. 
 She needs our help, not your judgment. 
 You're talking to her as if she's a child. 
 As far as I can see, that's exactly what she is. 
 A very pregnant one. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Shh! It's nearly midnight and I think we should all count the new year in together. 
 Here we go. 
 Oh! Ten! 
 Nine! Eight! Seven! 
 Six! 
 Five! Four! Three! 
 Two! One! 
 Happy New Year!

 Happy New Year! 
 Happy New Year, darling! 
 Here you are. 
 Are you alright? 
 No, you're not, are you? 
 Here, let me see. Oh, dear. 
 You've opened up your stitches. 
 Look at me. 
 Whoever it is you're afraid of, they can't hurt you while you're inside this hospital. 
 You understand that, don't you? 
 I really want you to trust me. 
 What's your name? 
 What's your name? 
 Gail. 
 I'm Joan. 
 I'm here to help you. 
 I'm going to get you to put this arm around me. 
 And on the count of three you're going to get up. 
 One, two, three, up. 
 I'd like to contact your parents and let them know where you are. 
 No! 
 Please... 
 My father, he doesn't know that I'm pregnant. 
 I've been running for months. 
 Gail, what happened to your back? Did someone do this to you? 
 Dr Millar, you're wanted in theatre. 
 Um, don't let her out of your sight. 
 So tell me about Mrs O'Reilly. 
 I can do a caesarean. 
 I'm sure you can, but she asked for a male doctor. 
 She's 40 years old, third pregnancy, the baby's in breach position. 
 I'll use a Pfannenstiel incision. It's a transverse cut... 
 I know what that is. 
 If I'd known you were coming back, I would have applied to do my residency somewhere else. 
 This is extremely uncomfortable. 
 It's untenable. 
 I'm sorry you feel that way. 
 I'm sorry you don't. 
 Welcome back, sir. 
 Is your wife well? 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 Why didn't you tell me he was coming back? 
 I thought it might be a nice surprise.

 Oh, hey, slaves! You missed a spot. 
 I suppose you were there till the bitter end? 
 Danced in the New Year. 
 How about you? 
 Oh, yeah. We had our own party. 
 Matron shouted the booze. 
 Hmm. 
 Hey, listen, Martha, there was a girl that was treated in casualty last night. 
 Do you think you could maybe check on her and see how she's going? 
 What's her name? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, what ward was she admitted to? 
 What do you think I am, a magician? 
 Quick, quick. 
 Oh, here comes trouble. 
 I'm outta here. 
 You just know something's crawled up her bum when she puts her mouth like that. 
 It's like a chook's beak. 
 Enjoying your work, girls? 
 Vivian, my office, please. 
 It was one night - the only night we've been out in months. 
 You have a visitor. 
 Hello, darling. 
 Mum. 
 So much stickier in the city, isn't it? 
 Do you miss the dry heat from home? 
 There's not much I miss about home at all, really. 
 It's been so many years since I've been to Sydney. 
 It's much busier now with all the cars. 
 I'm sure Dad could have told you something about it after he come back from drugging me and dumping me here. 
 I'm so sorry I let that happen to you. 
 Are you, Mum? 
 Let's sit. 
 What do you want? 
 I wanted to see you. 
 You've had seven months to come and see me, or write me a letter, ring. 
 Why now? 
 There's something I want to talk to you about. 
 Your father and I have separated. 
 He's left you? 
 He kicked me out. 
 You haven't... moved to Sydney, have you? 
 No, I'm staying with Aunty Rae. 
 I've just made so many dreadful mistakes. 
 Viv, I... I want you give me another chance to prove that I can be a good mother. 
 How am I supposed to do that? 
 Well, I want you to come home, Viv. 
 With the baby. 
 Six years of medicine, the top 2% of the population. 
 You guys are the smartest people in the country. Well done. 
 Very clever. 
 Except... I don't give a rat's arse how you got here, who your father is, what grades you got or uh, who you slept with. 
 Right now, in this hospital, you are on the lowest rung of a very long ladder. 
 And every rung of that ladder is going to cause you pain and misery. 
 This much I can promise you. 
 Now, people will call you 'Doctor'. 
 Don't listen to them. 
 You're not doctors. 
 You won't be doctors for years and... some of you not even then. 
 Ground rules - nothing, and I repeat, nothing happens in obstetrics and gynaecology without my say-so. Is that clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good. 
 Bowditch... you and Holt will be working with Dr Robinson. 
 And lose the tie. You look like a bloody circus clown. 
 Hagen, Matthews, Clark, you'll be working with Dr Sigley. 
 Millar, you'll be working to me. 
 And wipe the pancake off before someone sticks a tenner down your front and asks for an hour of your time. 
 Go on then. You must have something to do. 
 Millar, did you find a bed for that girl? 
 She spent the night in casualty. 
 Oh, bugger. I'll see what I can do. 
 In the meantime, organise the usual tests. 
 Yes, sir. 
 What kind of petty power games are you playing here? 
 Those things will kill you. 
 You just aged me ten years, Doctor. 
 Ah, impossible. 
 Listen, there's a patient I need moved to Stanton House. 
 An unmarried mother? 
 No idea. 
 It'd only be until a bed became available here. 
 Well, you know the procedure, Doctor. 
 I'm not asking your permission, Frances. 
 She just wanted to say hello? 
 Nothing else? 
 No. 
 I can't believe she'd just show up out of the blue like that. 
 After all these months, why come at all? 
 Good question. 
 The only thing that scares me about being a mum is that I might turn into my own. 
 Presently there are a number of other girls staying here. 
 Vivian, Patricia, Helen, this is Gail. 
 Hello. 
 You've met. 
 No. No. 
 Breakfast is at 5:30 and laundry duties commence at 6:00. 
 You're in safe hands here. 
 How was your meeting, Vivian, with your mother? 
 Oh, brilliant. Thanks for asking. 
 Seems to me you girls could do with a refresher on hospital corners. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, they put me here. 
 Have you decided to give up your baby? 
 Give it up? 
 That's what happens here. Babies are put up for adoption. 
 Gail, listen to me. No-one can make you stay here. 
 And nobody can make you give up your baby. 
 You have to make sure that you don't sign anything the Matron gives you. 
 Do you understand? 
 Yes. 
 Don't sign anything! 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. I spy... 
 Oh. 
 Why didn't you tell me he was back? 
 I didn't know till yesterday. 
 You can't work with him. He steals babies. 
 This is my career, Annie. 
 Have you forgiven him...? 
 No, I haven't. 
 I'm sorry. I just... 
 It's OK. 
 I understand. I do, I really do. 
 Would you like me to give Deanna her shots? 
 The nurse said she was... 
 Go on. Let me, please. 
 I never get to see her anymore, especially now I live here with these cavemen. 
 Hmm. You like that? 
 Come on. 
 Are you going to give up your baby? 
 That's the plan. 
 I can't imagine doing that. 
 I couldn't imagine being pregnant, and yet here I am. 
 Was he your boyfriend? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you love him? 
 I thought he was alright until I discovered that his spine was made of jelly and his mouth ran overtime. 
 Better off without him, then. 
 Yeah, figured that out a long time ago. 
 What about the father of your baby? 
 I wanted to get pregnant. 
 I thought if I had his baby then he'd have to want me. 
 So you trapped him? 
 Oh, I haven't told him yet. 
 But what if he doesn't want a baby? 
 Well, then at least I'll have something that's a part of him. 
 So who were you running away from last night? 
 I assume it wasn't your boyfriend. 
 My father. 
 When he's angry, he's... 
 What? 
 It's not fair of you to keep showing up like this. 
 Viv, just hear me out. 
 Go home! Work it out with Dad. 
 I know me being here is a shock and I understand why you're angry. 
 Now, I've had plenty of time to think. 
 You're only 17, you need to live your life, I understand that too. 
 So let me take the baby home. 
 You don't even need to come. 
 I can raise it on my own. 
 I'm young enough. People won't know. 
 Where would you say it came from? 
 I'll just make something up. 
 I'd say I went away. 
 This way, you'll always know that it's safe. 
 Safe? 
 With you? 
 There's no way, Mum. There is no way on earth that you are going to raise this baby. 
 Not this time. No. 
 The girl admitted last night, her file. 
 Take it to Stanton House for me, please. 
 Right away. 
 Doctor, Gail didn't mention anything to me about relinquishing her baby for adoption. 
 She's an unwed mother-to-be who needed a room. 
 She should stay here in the hospital. 
 Oh, I see. 
 So you'd have her sleeping in the corridor? 
 I saw Annie, and we... 
 Anyway, how's the, uh, baby? 
 Is the baby alright? 
 She had her immunisation boosters. 
 Which ones? 
 All of them. 
 Did you tell her to watch out for a fever? Rose is prone to them. 
 If it spikes above 39, she should bring her in immediately. 
 The baby's name is Deanna. 
 And Annie knows what to do. 
 I hope so. 
 You girls will pay attention because this is the last time I explain this. 
 Yes, Matron. 
 You will position a flat sheet over the mattress. 
 The long edges and the foot edge should hang below the bottom of the mattress and the long edges should hang equally. 
 Tuck the foot edge under the mattress from corner to corner. 
 Make sure the sheet lies smoothly. 
 The folded edge of the sheet should form a 45-degree angle from that corner on the surface of the bed. 
 Should we measure it, Matron? 
 It won't be necessary. 
 A good rule of thumb is that both edges of the sheet should be lined up and vertical. 
 Oh. 
 Bring the sheet corner on the bed over the edge of the mattress and tuck the hanging edge under the mattress tightly. 
 Did everyone follow that? 
 Gail? 
 You lost me a bit. 
 At which point, dear? 
 Right after, "This is the last time that I explain this." 
 Enough! 
 That is enough! 
 That is enough of that. 
 You girls may think that hospital corners are a laughing matter... 
 Get up now. 
 Gail? 
 Stop it. Stop being ridiculous. 
 I can't. It hurts. 
 Matron, she's not joking. 
 Matron. 
 Alright, get her up. 
 Foetal heartbeat's thready. 
 Slow breaths. 
 BP's 130 over 90. 
 We need to deliver this baby. 
 It hurts so much! 
 I want oxygen and 100 milligrams of pethidine IM. 
 Deep breaths, Gail. Slow breaths. 
 You're not taking my baby! 
 No-one is taking your baby, Gail. 
 Look at me. 
 I promise you I am here for you and your baby, and everything's going to be alright, OK? 
 You're doing really well. Good girl. 
 Bowditch, I need you! 
 Me? 
 Now. 
 BP's falling. It's placenta praevia. 
 She's eight centimetres already. 
 Help me here! 
 She should be in theatre. Will we call Dr McNaughton? 
 She's haemorrhaging. Set up for an emergency C-section. 
 Put in an IV. 
 Make sure it's a large cannula and prepare two units of whole blood. 
 There's no time to get to theatre. The baby's almost here. 
 We'll have to continue. Nurse, call Dr McNaughton. 
 I can deal with this. 
 How's she coping? 
 Blood's in and BP's stabilising. 
 Let's just focus on getting this baby out. 
 OK, Gail, you're going to have to give this your best shot. 
 Ready? 
 Baby's head's crowning. Good girl. 
 It's almost here, alright. 
 Next push, I want you to give it everything you've got, Gail. 
 Push with everything you have, right? 
 Establish breathing and heart rate. 
 Is my baby alright? 
 He's going to be fine. 
 Alright, ten units of oxytocin into her IV infusion. 
 Let's get this placenta out. 
 Yes, Doctor. 
 Shh. There we go. 
 OK. 
 I hope Gail's alright. 
 She's in good hands. 
 You're not allowed to be angry with me. 
 I think you were a bit hard on your mum this morning. 
 You don't know what you're talking about. 
 I think it's lovely that she wants to raise your baby. 
 How do you know that that's what she wants to do? 
 Cos I heard you two talking. 
 You should at least consider it. 
 Wouldn't it be better than your baby going to some strangers? 
 You shouldn't listen to conversations that have nothing to do with you. 
 Viv, if you've got a chance to keep your child in your life, why wouldn't you take that? 
 Hey, Viv. 
 Hey, Pattie. 
 Shouldn't you two be lying down, or resting, or something? 
 You know, that is exactly what Matron said. 
 But we said, "No, Matron, We couldn't possibly lie down and rest when there's all this work to do. The hospital's depending on us." 
 Uh, Viv, I'm going to need you to come down the station with me. 
 She's in here. 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 Hey, Mum. 
 Mum. 
 Mum. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, gosh, darling, I'm so sorry. 
 Oh, I don't know what happened. 
 Where's your purse, Mum? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 I had it. It's got our tickets in it. 
 What tickets? 
 To Tamworth. 
 Do you know what I thought? 
 I thought you could play netball again because you always love netball and I'm sure those girls would love to have you back on their team. 
 Just... Get everything back to normal again. 
 Is that what you call it? 
 I had a couple of drinks. That don't make me a drunk. 
 You can call yourself whatever you want. 
 But you had your chance and you stuffed it up. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I am... Very sorry for everything. 
 But don't hate me. 
 I don't hate you, Mum. 
 But you are not having this baby. 
 And I'm not coming back to Tamworth. 
 What am I going to do, Viv? 
 Everybody is leaving me! 
 Help me. 
 Is my baby alright? 
 Yes. You had a little boy, 
 7.5 pounds, so not quite so little. 
 Just like his dad. 
 There was so much blood. 
 Yes, well... 
 The placenta was obstructing the baby's birth canal. 
 That's what was causing all the bleeding... 
 I'm not giving up my baby. 
 I know that. 
 I haven't signed any papers. 
 I know. It's alright. Shh. 
 Gail, I'd really like to contact your family... 
 No. 
 At least let them know where you are and that you're alright. 
 No. 
 What about your boyfriend? 
 No! 
 When he sees the baby, he's going to fall madly in love with it. 
 I know he will. 
 Well, do you have a contact number for him? 
 I can call him for you if you like. 
 Millar, you were due on rounds half an hour ago. 
 I'll be with you shortly. 
 I want you now. 
 You sleep. 
 Nothing happens in obstetrics and gynaecology without my say-so. 
 Those were my exact words. 
 It was an emergency. The girl had placenta praevia. 
 Of course it was a bloody emergency! 
 One you could have predicted if you'd examined her properly in the first place. 
 The patient was transferred to Stanton House without my knowledge. 
 I didn't have time to diagnose. 
 No, no, no. Not good enough! 
 You could have killed her! 
 There you go. 
 Can I get you anything else? 
 No, thank you. 
 I'm so sorry you had to see this. 
 Well, I've seen a lot worse. 
 So, mum, uh, does this a lot? 
 Enough. 
 It must have been hard growing up. 
 I spent years making excuses for her. 
 She had the gall to pack me off to this place because people might talk. 
 They were talking alright, Mum... but it wasn't about me. 
 When you finish that, do you want me to drive you back to Stanton House? 
 What'll happen? Will you book her? 
 No, no. Once she's slept it off, I'll drive her back to her hotel. 
 You'll put her on the train home? 
 Yeah, if you want. 
 Thank you. 
 Please. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, baby. 
 I know it hurts. 
 Nearly done. 
 Almost. 
 Yeah, he's looking a lot better. 
 Hmm. 
 Once his haemoglobin levels are back to normal, he should be fine. 
 I'm not real good around blood. 
 I noticed. 
 It's funny, you don't seem to have a problem with corpses. 
 Hey, for what it's worth, I thought you were terrific today. 
 You saved them both, mum and baby. 
 Have you seen my baby? 
 We're not allowed near the nursery. 
 It's a boy. 
 Oh! What are you going to call him? 
 James Paul. 
 Who's James then? 
 I just like it. 
 What about Paul? 
 As in McCartney! 
 John's my favourite. 
 I like all the disciples' names. 
 You haven't signed anything yet, have you? 
 No. No. 
 Good. 
 Oh, is that my baby? 
 Yes. I snuck him out to come and say hello. 
 Oh, he's so tiny! 
 Can I touch him? 
 Oh! 
 Hello, James. 
 You look exactly like your daddy. 
 He's so beautiful. 
 I can't believe that he's mine. 
 Time for you two to go now! 
 And time for this little one to go back to the nursery. 
 No! You're not taking my baby! 
 It's OK. James just needs to go back to the nursery... 
 No! Oh! I feel sick.

 She's haemorrhaging. 
 Out now! Resus.

 Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 
 Come on! 
 Dr Millar, she's gone. Stop. 
 Nine, ten. No! No! 
 Just stop, Doctor. 
 Get off me! 
 Seven, eight, nine, ten. 
 No! 
 Stop it. 
 No! No! More adrenaline! 
 Seven, eight... 
 Dr Millar, stop. 
 Gail, come on! Breathe! 
 No! No! No! Get off me!

 In mercy and love, blot out the sins she has committed through human weakness...
