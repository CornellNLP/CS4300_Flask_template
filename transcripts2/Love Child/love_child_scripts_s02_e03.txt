 Oh, my God. That's Robert! 
 Hey. 
 Oh! Oh! 
 I've booked a church. 
 It's a Catholic church. 
 It's business. Winners and losers. 
 I don't like that sort of business. 
 Don't bet. 
 If you think you can hoodwink me in order to take advantage of my girls, then you're very mistaken. 
 I don't want anything to do with your girls, or you. 
 You hang around with him because he makes you feel good, but he's only after you for your money. 
 Be quiet! 
 You're just as big a slut as the rest of us. 
 He's my son! 
 Johnny was a pacifist when I met him. 
 He felt he had to sign up so he could look after me and the baby. 
 And that's what got him killed. 
 You're not Joan. 
 Wrong colour for a start. 
 ..eight, nine... Get off me! 
 His mother died because of me. 
 I owe it to her. He has the right to know who his father is. 
 I know this man. I saw him at the Save Our City demo. 
 If Greg Mathieson gets his way, this community will be demolished to make way for his high-rise monstrosity and ordinary people will not be able to afford to live here! 
 Yeah! 
 But today we draw a line. 
 Scumbag! 
 You can't keep him here. 
 I've told you repeatedly... 
 What are you charging him with? 
 I'm asking you to leave quietly. 
 He didn't do anything. 
 He's the one who got hit. 
 This is not OK. I want to see him. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I've asked you to leave. 
 Get your hands off me! You pig! 
 Get off me! 
 All of them out! 
 I've come to speak to one of the men you arrested. 
 Name of? 
 Jim, I think. 
 Jim Marsh? 
 Can I see him? 
 What the hell do you want with a sewer rat like him? 
 It's personal. 
 He's being charged and processed. 
 You can wait over there if you want. 
 I really, I want you here when the baby's born. 
 Shhh! I'm on the phone. 
 Could the girls who've already been given their arrival papers, move over to the wall so we can deal with everyone else. 
 I don't know when exactly but it's soon. 
 Yeah, the baby decides that, Robert. 
 Helen, show these girls up to the dormitory, please. 
 There are no spare beds, Matron. 
 There are fold-out beds in the storeroom. 
 I love you too. 
 I can't hear anything. 
 Can we just keep it down a bit? 
 OK, girls. Follow me. 
 No! Matron! 
 Get upstairs and help. 
 It's not a hotel. 
 An orderly line, please! 
 Right, which of you were here first? 
 My cousin Judith, who I grew up with, fell pregnant to her husband, Scott. But they were killed in a tragic bus crash near Werribee. 
 Robert and I knew there was no-one that could take their poor orphaned child, so we adopted it. 
 Will anyone believe that? 
 Robert reckons they will. 
 Your mum knows you're pregnant. 
 That's why she sent you here. 
 My parents don't talk to me anymore since I told them I was, ah, becoming a Catholic. 
 Not at all? 
 I've been cut off. 
 Pattie. 
 Don't do anything. 
 You should be resting. 
 If you are up to working, then so am I. 
 Where are you going to say you've been for eight months? 
 Finishing school? 
 You sure you want to lie like that? 
 Bad karma. 
 What does that mean? 
 It'll be with you for the rest of your life. 
 And your kid. 
 Well, if it means Robert and I can have a family, then that will be worth it. 
 Oh, he kicked! 
 He? 
 I think it has to be. I think he's going to be a ruckman for Hawthorn. 
 Patricia, my office, please. 
 Vivian, get back to bed or I'll have you discharged immediately. 
 Yes, Matron. 
 Martha, Dr Bowditch was looking for you. 
 Not him. What does he want? 
 Do I look like a message service? 
 Ah. 
 Come on. 
 Your adoption papers. 
 I've told you I'm not signing those. I'm going to keep my baby. 
 You think you're here to be pampered for eight months and then leave at your own convenience. 
 Pampered? 
 You may have noticed that space is in very short supply here and there are plenty of girls who are prepared to do the right thing who'll happily take your place. 
 It's not the right thing! 
 I'm doing the right thing! 
 Robert and I are getting married. 
 Is that so? 
 Where is he then? 
 He's working, but he'll come when the baby's born. 
 You stupid girl! 
 He's a callow hobbledehoy who's already left you twice... 
 He loves me! 
 ..and he'll leave you again just as soon as it suits him. 
 You just hate the idea of anyone else being happy, cos you're a barren old cow! Ah! 
 You are free to leave whenever you want. 
 Well, I'll go now then. 
 Hey! We need some water and I want to make a phone call. 
 Two minutes. 
 Hey! 
 You deaf? I'm speaking to you! 
 Jim? 
 What do you want? 
 I've come to talk to you about a girl called Gail. I believe... 
 Never heard of her. 
 I found a photograph of you in her things. I believe you two were... 
 I've had my photo taken a lot, missy. 
 What, you work for the government? 
 No. 
 She came to Kings Cross Hospital... 
 Look, if you're here running some bullshit errand for Greg Mathieson, I'm not playing, OK? He can come if he wants to talk himself, and not send some shitkicker. 
 You should really get that cut seen to. 
 It'd be a shame if it got infected and your head had to come off. 
 Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Shirley, are you there? 
 Did you find his father? 
 No. 
 How long till he's adopted out? 
 Not long now. We're under pressure to move faster. 
 It will be easy to find him a family. He's a beautiful boy. 
 Shirley hasn't been in to feed her son in two days. 
 Why not? 
 I thought you might know that. 
 I don't know how many times you need to be told. 
 Chris is downstairs. He wants to see you. 
 What did you say to him? 
 Nothing. I would never say anything about you being... 
 Not another word! 
 Chris. What's happened? 
 I just got out of the boob. 
 What? Sorry? 
 Jail. 
 Didn't know who else to call. 
 Could use a feed if you've got one. 
 Of course. 
 Come with me. 
 Not taking the food out of the mouth of some poor banged-up girl, am I? 
 Probably. 
 What... did you do? What crime? 
 Just SP stuff. Bookmaking. 
 Got pinched once too often. 
 Chris... 
 Hand on heart, I never hurt anyone. 
 Never stole a cent. 
 They still put me in with the rapists and the killers. 
 How long...? 
 How long have you been living here? 
 Longer than the furniture. 
 Is there a Mr Bolton? Kids? 
 If I were married I'd hardly be living here. 
 What are your plans? 
 Find a place. Get a job. 
 A legal job? 
 I run a good book. 
 You should try to make something of yourself, something worthwhile. 
 Get myself a good suit, eh? 
 Have a shave? 
 Couldn't hurt. 
 Tell you what - 
 I could murder a beer. 
 I don't have any but I could get you some. 
 I'd love you forever. 
 That's the best soup I've ever had. 
 While you're looking for somewhere you could stay here. 
 Well, ah, um... OK. 
 Er, before when I asked about a Mr Bolton, I wasn't... 
 Pardon? 
 I didn't mean to give you the wrong... 
 Oh! No. No. 
 No, I wasn't implying... 
 I'll be back shortly. 
 Shirley. Please open the door. 
 Brandy? 
 I went to the club. 
 I saw Annie. 
 Shirley, I'm so sorry. 
 He never wanted to be over there. 
 I had a bad feeling about it from the moment he left. 
 Have the army told you anything? 
 No. I'm not entitled to any information because we weren't married. 
 What about his family? 
 They don't talk to me either. 
 You can't hide in here forever. 
 Ben needs to be fed. 
 How can I care for him? 
 You have to. 
 He'll be well enough to be home in a few weeks. 
 What kind of a home is this? 
 Annie manages. 
 Does she? 
 Ask her. She has a career, picking up glasses and pouring drinks for a dollar an hour. 
 How do I buy nappies, clothes, food? 
 You are one of the only women to go through Stanton House and keep their child. 
 Don't underestimate that achievement. 
 What if it was a mistake? 
 Ah... Please don't do that. Ah! 
 Don't do that. 
 Don't touch me. 
 Leave her alone! Stop it! Scat! 
 Come on. 
 There's soup in the kitchen upstairs. 
 Matron, I'm sorry I spoke to you the way I did. 
 Well, perhaps you'll think twice next time. 
 I can't sign those papers. 
 I can't. 
 And when you find yourself alone on the street once again, but with a child in your arms, without your family, without your fiance, who will rescue you then? 
 Robert will. 
 I know he's not perfect but he has a good heart. 
 Go on. 
 Sign. 
 You charge that bloke that hit me? 
 You'll be notified when your case comes up in the Local Court. 
 Miss it and you'll go in. 
 You bastards are all in this together. 
 Hey, what's that about? 
 She told me her name was Abigail. 
 Abigail what? 
 She never said. 
 You don't know her family? 
 We met at a Moratorium rally. 
 We weren't together very long. 
 And she just... disappeared. 
 Beautiful Abbie. 
 She was in love with you. 
 She was young. 
 A lot younger than you, that's for sure. 
 I didn't take advantage of her. 
 She was a grown-up and we had a great time together. 
 I never would have hurt her. 
 I had nothing to do with whatever killed her, if that's what you're thinking. 
 I know that. 
 She died in childbirth. 
 She was pregnant? 
 Yes. 
 Are you sure it's mine? 
 If anyone was in a position to know, she was. 
 She told me she was on the pill. 
 That's neither here nor there now, is it? 
 I'm just saying it's her word for it. 
 There are blood tests we can do, tell us more. 
 How much more? 
 Gail was blood type O negative. 
 So is he. 
 If you are too, the chances of him being yours are pretty high. 
 What then? 
 You choose. It's up to you. 
 I don't have eight arms. 
 Get rid of these files for me, Martha. 
 Just dump you rubbish and expect me to sort it out. 
 Matron. 
 Those files are for the social workers' office. 
 Alright. 
 I do need to go to the incinerator. 
 Now, please. 
 Everything has to be now. 
 Do it now, Martha. 
 Hurry up and throw this out. Hurry up and take this baby. Hurry up and just do this and that. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Martha! Wait up. 
 I've been trying to catch you for days. 
 Oh, well. 
 Thorpie's playing the Tin Shed Friday night. 
 What? 
 Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs playing Sydney Stadium on Friday night. 
 You want to go? 
 Never heard of them. 
 Oh, it'll be a blast. 
 They're knocking the old place down in a couple of months, building the Eastern Suburbs Railway. 
 Last concert ever. My shout. 
 Um... 
 No-one has to know. It'll be our secret. 
 Save yourself the embarrassment. Take a white girl. 
 What? 
 Oh, no, I didn't mean it like that! 
 Martha, I only meant if there was a reason you thought... 
 The door! 
 Locks from the inside. 
 Why do you think I jammed it open? 
 How do we get down? 
 You tell me. 
 You should jump. 
 Oh. 
 Where's Joan? I asked for Joan. 
 She can deliver your baby when the time comes. 
 Just lie back and relax for me. 
 Let's take a look at you, OK? 
 Do you think it's a boy or a girl? 
 Can you tell? 
 Not until it arrives. 
 I did the ring test. 
 I tied a hair around a ring and I swung it in front of myself, and it went in circles, so I think it's a boy. 
 You're supposed to do that test with a wedding ring and I haven't got one yet. 
 Robert would like a boy but I'd love a little girl. 
 You've felt him kicking? 
 Like a horse. 
 He nearly knocked me over yesterday. 
 No problems? Cramping? Bleeding? 
 No. 
 Would you excuse me a moment?

 Will you get in trouble? 
 It's only a pre-eclampsia tutorial. 
 I'll make it up. 
 Cocky, aren't you? 
 You've got to be confident to be a doctor. 
 What kind of doctor faints at the sight of blood? 
 Who said that? 
 Word gets out. 
 Oh! I'm supposed to get these to the social workers' office. 
 What's wrong? 
 That's not Patricia's writing. 
 We really need to get off this roof. 
 O negative. 
 It's mine then, isn't it? 
 Well, unless Gail had a relationship around the same time with another man who's also O negative, yes, he's yours. 
 What now? 
 You choose. 
 Do you want your son or not? 
 I wouldn't know what the hell to do with a kid. 
 You could learn. 
 What if I say no? 
 He'll be adopted. 
 That'll be good then. 
 Wouldn't it? 
 Gail wrote you this. 
 She wanted you to be a father. 
 I didn't even know I was going to be a father until last night. 
 You owe her something. 
 "I have money. We can go away." 
 What sort of money did she have? 
 I don't know. 
 But she wanted you to fall in love with your child. 
 And why the hell do you care? 
 He's your responsibility. 
 Not yet he isn't. 
 Grow a spine. 
 There are things that I have to do. 
 Important things. 
 Sure. 
 That make you the centre of attention. 
 So what is it...? What's wrong? 
 Just a moment. 
 Patricia... sometimes... .in the darkness, the only light we can find is within ourselves. 
 And we must find a way to believe, even when there is no hope. I'm very sorry. 
 Your baby's heart has stopped. 
 Don't say that! 
 Try it, try it again. 
 Try the machine again. 
 I've checked on the Doppler machine and there is no heartbeat. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 Maybe it was... 
 Just try it one more time, please. 
 It's asleep. 
 I couldn't fit through there. 
 I reckon I could. 
 Oh, there. 
 Give me a boost. 
 Go on. 
 Hurry! Close your eyes. 
 What? 
 Close your eyes. I don't want you looking up my dress. 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Martha. 
 Martha. 
 Martha! 
 You busy? 
 I am if it means I don't have to talk to you. 
 We're all looking for an outcome. 
 I am, you are, so let's try and make it a win-win. 
 You're kicking people out of their homes. Where's the win for them? 
 Jim, focus on the big picture. 
 What do you want? 
 You call off your dogs, I'll make it worth your while. 
 I don't understand. 
 He's been kicking hard. 
 I can feel him. 
 The umbilical cord could have got caught around the baby's neck. 
 There might have been an infection. 
 Sometimes we don't know the reason at all. 
 Dr McNaughton will be in soon. 
 He'll give you an injection that will bring on labour so you can deliver. 
 Oh, God! 
 Pattie! Pattie! 
 Pattie! 
 Oh, something's happened... 
 Sh! 
 She's signed your adoption papers. 
 What? 
 Matron. 
 She's forged your signature. 
 She's just told me that my baby died. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 She wants to take your baby. 
 We've got to get you out of here right now. 
 What? 
 We'll go back to my place. 
 Robert's not answering. 
 Where is he? 
 He said he'd be at work. 
 I'll try again later. 
 What am I going to do? 
 I need all my things. 
 It's alright. I'll get them. 
 Just calm down. 
 OK. 
 Pattie, it's OK. 
 It's OK. Come sit down. 
 Sit down. Here we go. 
 Deep breaths. Now, are you absolutely sure they are Pattie's adoption papers that you saw? 
 I'm sure. 
 I would never sign... 
 I know. It's OK. Sh now, OK? 
 Pattie... .there's no heartbeat. 
 Sorry. 
 Good girl. You're doing so well. 
 Really, really well, Pattie. 
 Alright, look, I want you to take my hand and we're going to push together, OK? One last time. 
 Big push. Ready? 
 It hurts so much! 
 It hurts so much. 
 You're doing so well. 
 You're nearly there, nearly there. 
 I want you to give me another, one last big push, right into your tailbone, OK? 
 This is my fault! It's all my fault? 
 What? 
 It's all my fault. 
 What? 
 This is bad karma. 
 I was going to say that the baby wasn't ours. 
 Now he's being punished. 
 No, that is absolute nonsense. 
 No-one is being punished. 
 No-one is being punished and this is no-one's fault, OK? 
 Big push coming on now. Ready? 
 No! Get out! You get out! 
 Get out of here! 
 I hate you! Get out! 
 What're you doing? 
 Sorry about paying attention. 
 I was always going to pay you back, plus interest. 
 Where did you get it? 
 I won it on a horse. 
 Fair dinkum. May God strike me down. 
 It's all there. 
 Count it if you want. 
 You look more presentable. 
 Hmm. It's no bad, eh? 
 Plus I got a job. 
 A real one. 
 Will wonders ever cease? 
 No-one's ever given a rat's arse about me. 
 You're the only one. 
 I'm grateful. 
 Should I? 
 That's up to you. 
 Oh! 
 It's a girl. 
 Hello. 
 I was going to call him Eugene. 
 So I'll call her Jean. 
 That's perfect. 
 She's so beautiful. 
 She's so beautiful. 
 I love you. Oh! 
 It's not done. 
 The child is dead. 
 Just let her hold her for a while. 
 What's the harm? 
 It's not healthy. 
 I think it will help her. 
 How is she? 
 Devastated. 
 It's a terrible thing. 
 The sadness will pass. 
 She'll have others. 
 You forged the signature on her adoption papers. 
 That's neither here nor there now. 
 But why? 
 You go out of your way to be despised. 
 Those papers would have given Patricia a choice when the time came for her to face the truth, that her fiance is worthless. 
 Why be so brutal? 
 There are other ways you could have given her those choices. 
 Is there anything else you want? 
 I have things to do. 
 Help you sleep. 
 I had a daughter, Grace. 
 Born five weeks premature and in this world for a day and a half. 
 She was beautiful too. 
 She's a strong girl. 
 She'll bounce back. 
 Are you and Eva still planning to start a family? 
 Eva... Eva and I... we've separated. 
 Because of Annie's baby? 
 No. Because of you and me. 
 I want to see my son. 
 You need to support the head. 
 OK. 
 His neck isn't strong enough yet. 
 Yeah? 
 Hey.

 Robert?

 Certainly not him. 
 I am never giving you my son. 
 Open the door! 
 Where is my baby? 
 I've never stopped loving you. 
 Annie? 
 Wake up! 
 Stop!
