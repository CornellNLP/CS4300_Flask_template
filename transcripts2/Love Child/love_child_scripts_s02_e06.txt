 My babies. Where are my babies? 
 They were adopted. 
 At least tell me that they're together. 
 Yes, they're together. 
 They're just flowers. 
 Girls like flowers. 
 Look, I've had enough with blokes like you. 
 Doctors? 
 Rich white blokes, like the ones that took me from my mum. 
 You're not taking my baby! 
 I promise you I'm here for you and your baby, and everything's going to be alright. 
 It is my belief that the patient's death was entirely avoidable and was caused by the negligence of junior resident Dr Joan Millar. 
 Do you think I'll be OK as a dad? 
 I think you'd be a great dad. 
 Then help me? 
 We're here to discuss the future of James. 
 I was hoping you might be able to come to some sort of shared arrangement. 
 No. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Now, here are all the documents you wanted, showing the high likelihood of his being the biological father. 
 Why are you taking such a personal interest in this? 
 I made a promise to the mother. 
 And Jim is... a friend. 
 I had an idea about the whole single bloke thing and all that. 
 Don't bring that up unless she does. 
 Let's get married. 
 It now seems inevitable that President Nixon will authorise an all-out military assault on communist strongholds across the Vietnam border in Cambodia. 
 This is certain to intensify opposition to the Vietnam war, both in America and here in Australia, where there have been calls for the commemoration of Anzac Day to be cancelled. 
 Morning, Matron. 
 Hey, did you get my messages? 
 I am working. 
 I've been preparing for mid-term assessments. 
 All the paperwork's lined up so all we need to do is show up and sign the forms and be done. 
 Oh, if it's that simple, why don't you just marry someone else? 
 It's a tough sell for a bloke - 
 "Marry me so I can have a baby." 
 Hey, come on. It won't be real. 
 It would need to look real. 
 Yeah. After we have the baby a month we'll apply for a divorce and go our separate ways. Oh! 
 Bob's your uncle. It's not like I'm asking you to sleep with me. 
 If I get married they will crucify me here. 
 Women doctors aren't allowed to be married. 
 Not allowed? 
 It's not written down, but the idea that I'm even of thinking of settling down to have children of my own will kill my career. 
 We're talking about my child, who already exists. 
 Yes, I know that, but I have spent the last ten years of my life working to get to where I am. 
 Does my son have to spend the next 20 years of his life with an abusive grandfather, to protect your career? 
 Hey, where are you taking him? 
 For a bath. 
 You're not allowed in here. 
 He's my son. 
 Out! 
 Oh, Pattie, do you have plans? 
 Uh, pardon? 
 Would you be able to take Ben? 
 I've got to fill out a job application form and take it in. 
 The club's such a bad place for him, what with all the smoke and his weak lungs. 
 And he does love you. 
 Does he? 
 Oh, I guess I can take him for a little while. 
 His bottles are in the fridge. 
 Nappies in the cupboard in my room, dirty nappy bucket in the laundry. 
 OK. OK. 
 So how late will you be? 
 Not late. Promise. 
 OK. OK. 
 Oh, is that...? 
 Deanna. Annie dropped her off, said you agreed to take her. 
 Was that today, was it? 
 Have you got the job application? 
 Yeah, they want me to type 20 words a minute. 
 Doesn't sound like too many. 
 You don't know how to type. 
 Yes, I do, a little bit. 
 I'm actually waiting on a call back from Mark Foy's, the counter job. 
 You applied for that job days ago. 
 They seemed very interested. 
 The lady told me that she liked my hair. 
 How are you supposed to apply for jobs when you've got these babies around? 
 Don't look at me. 
 I'm not taking someone else's kid to work one more time. 
 I'll manage. I'll manage. 
 If you set your sights a little lower, princess, you might actually land something, like cleaning or cooking. 
 I think those jobs are for... 
 Black girls? 
 No, immigrants. 
 Something will come up. 
 There's no free ride, Pattie. 
 Have you started your assessments? 
 I'm finishing them tonight. 
 If you say good things about me in your peer assessments, I'll say good things about you. 
 Someone might notice the collusion. 
 Can't you just help me a bit? 
 I really need to pass. 
 And why should that be my problem? 
 Eleanor, uh, the little Marsh baby, James...? 
 He doesn't have a surname yet. 
 When will his custody be decided? 
 I'm visiting the grandfather's house later today to assess it, and then Mr Marsh. 
 But, unfortunately, neither of them can provide a long-term female presence in the home. 
 That shouldn't matter. 
 Women care for children. 
 Men provide for them. 
 You have time for a chat? 
 I'll buy you a milkshake. 
 What do you want? 
 I'm trying to get a stake together for tomorrow. 
 I want to run a two-up school down at the Ivanhoe. 
 A what? 
 Two-up. 
 Anzac Day. You know, pennies on a board, heads or tails? 
 Oh, a betting game. 
 Yeah, but tomorrow's the only day of the year it's legal. 
 The thing is I'm, uh... I'm skint, but if I can scrape together 100 bucks or so, it should be enough to get started. 
 You want me to give you money? 
 Lend. 
 50 bucks? 
 That's a week's pay! 
 You'll get it back, dead set. 
 20? 
 Er... no. 
 No? How about a kiss? 
 Where's the bub? 
 In safe hands. 
 Give us a sec. Hey, Viv! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Um, I've been transferred, a little place up north called Byron Bay. 
 It's on the beach. You heard of it? 
 No. 
 I'm going to buy a block of land, build a place. 
 I'll miss you. 
 Will you? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I don't suppose you'd want to come with me? 
 Are you... proposing? 
 I...um... yeah. I guess I am. 
 I mean, you know, it wouldn't have to be, uh, straight away. 
 You know, I could go... 
 I'll go there and set up... 
 Look, I know this is really quick but I'm leaving in a couple of days. 
 I have a job here. 
 Just... just... think about it. 
 We'll be living on a beach. 
 Go swimming every day. 
 Um. Tell me tomorrow night. 
 I'll... I'll take you out. 
 Anzac Day tomorrow - everything's shut. 
 Er, no, Blue Moon's open. 
 I'll book us a table. 
 Just think about it. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm going to fail. I can feel it. 
 There is no such thing as fail. 
 If the assessment's unsatisfactory... 
 ..we repeat. I know. Same thing. 
 Maguire, Vivian. 
 It's my first one. 
 Bowditch, Simon. 
 Martha, can you give me files on all the babies I've delivered in the past month? 
 Haven't you got records of your own? 
 Yeah, I just need to double check. 
 Move. 
 Millar, Joan. 
 Thank you, Martha. 
 Enfelder, Glen. 
 Herben, Stuart. 
 You served? 
 Bougainville and Morotai. 
 I was in Malaya. 
 You Matron Bolton? 
 Yes. 
 Greg Mathieson. 
 I know. You're a property developer. 
 I've seen you on the television. 
 Much happier when I'm not in the limelight. 
 Making worthy progress all the same. 
 Sorry for your loss. 
 Thank you. 
 I wanted to talk about the adoption of my grandson. 
 Unfortunately, that's not up to me. 
 They say you have more power behind the throne than you let on. 
 Sounds like vexatious rumour. 
 May I come in? 
 Please. Sit down. 
 Marching tomorrow? 
 Of course. 
 You? It'd take more than a few unwashed cretins to keep me away. 
 I have a niggling respect for those unwashed cretins, strangely. 
 Never get into a war you don't know how to win. 
 Vietnam's not like the others. 
 How long were you in Malaya? 
 Three years. Wretched business. 
 I got back, I expected my wife to have moved on, but she waited. 
 Loyal to the bone. 
 I loved her for that. 
 What happened to her? 
 If she was still with you, I'm sure you would have been granted custody of the baby by now. 
 She died. 
 Then it was just me and Gail, my daughter. 
 Did you marry? 
 Yes. He was a soldier too. 
 He never returned. 
 Well, perhaps we'll see each other tomorrow. 
 Quite possibly. 
 There won't be too many of us. 
 I'll buy you a drink. 
 I'd like that. 
 Do you think I could see my grandson? 
 Of course. 
 This way. 
 Thanks, fellas. 
 Cheers. 
 I have, er... I've changed my mind. 
 Let's... let's get married. 
 I won't pretend my performance has been great. 
 I've been inconsistent, patchy, even. 
 And it's taken me a while to get over my haemophobia. 
 What are you doing? 
 Self-assessment. 
 The first part of the assessment process. 
 These are all the files I could get. 
 This is so good of you. Thank you! 
 Don't go overboard. 
 It's just a couple of files. 
 No, but any help I can get is unreal. 
 They're boomerangs, yeah? 
 Pardon? 
 They've got to come back. 
 Ah. 
 Boomerangs. 
 Have you ever...? 
 No. 
 Sorry. 
 Show me? 
 You're talking yourself down a bit. 
 Yeah. I figured better to be honest. 
 Rubbish. 
 You've got to talk yourself up. 
 You think? 
 Say you've got excellent communication skills and a determination to improve. 
 You've got a really good heart. 
 You might be the loveliest girl I've ever met. 
 I'm looking for Dr Millar. 
 Um... Yeah, I think she's up in maternity. 
 I don't know where. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry. Excuse me. 
 If you see her, can you... let her know I'm looking? 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 I had to get some things. 
 Don't worry. The groom's not here yet. You look nice. 
 I love weddings. 
 Don't get too excited. 
 This one's get in, sign, get out. 
 OK, something old, something new, something blue. 
 Old, from the op shop. 
 Lovely. 
 Open it. 
 New and blue. 
 I can't see these getting a run any time soon. 
 Something borrowed? 
 Me! Are you sure this is a good idea? 
 No. 
 Is this him? 
 Oh, good to see you've made an effort. 
 Jim, this is Shirley, my witness. 
 Bridesmaid. 
 G'day. 
 Where's yours? 
 What? 
 Your witness. 
 Oh, we'll grab someone inside. 
 Come on. 
 At least tuck your shirt in. 
 Before you are joined in marriage in my presence and in the presence of these witnesses... 
 Can we just skip the unnecessary bits? 
 I'm in a little bit of a hurry. 
 That's fine. So am I. 
 Is there any reason why you cannot be married? 
 Like consanguinity? 
 No. 
 What? 
 Oh, he's asking if we're related. 
 No. 
 Rings? 
 No. 
 By the authority vested in me by the state of New South Wales, I now pronounce you man and wife. 
 Congratulations. 
 You may kiss the bride. 
 Eh, shall we? 
 Let's just sign. 
 I've been looking for you. 
 Oh, I know. Dr Bowditch told me. 
 I wanted you to assist me in theatre, the tubal ligation. 
 Mrs Hamilton. 
 Yes. Where were you? 
 I had a family emergency to attend to. 
 You left the hospital in the middle of the day for almost three hours without telling anyone. 
 I know, I'm sorry. 
 I didn't realise I'd be gone for so long. 
 Parents? 
 Sorry? 
 You said you had a family matter. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Everything's alright now? 
 Yes. 
 I got you in at 9:30 tomorrow for your face-to-face interview. 
 Right. 
 It's the best slot - not first, but early enough so your inquisitors are still paying attention. 
 You think I need special favours? 
 You know better than anyone, it's not a level playing field. 
 Married? 
 I didn't realise you were engaged. 
 No rings? 
 Oh, we'll get to that. 
 It's, um... 
 It's been such a whirlwind. 
 You haven't known each other very long. 
 Um... 
 To be honest, no. 
 It was really the welfare of baby James, the baby, that brought us together. 
 And sometimes you know when you've just met your kindred spirit, don't you? 
 Love is a powerful thing. 
 It is. 
 So true. 
 So you're fully prepared to be a mother to this child? 
 Yes. 
 And work as a doctor, full-time? 
 It can be done. 
 Tell me how. 
 We'll share the duties and your family... 
 My family's very supportive. 
 And I am 100% committed to giving baby James all the love and care that he needs. 
 Look, just tell us if we can have my son. 
 I'll speak with the Equity Court, and that should just be a formality. 
 We're gonna have him? 
 9:30 tomorrow morning, we'll finalise the paperwork. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, can it be a little bit later than 9:30? 
 I'm already putting myself out doing this on a public holiday. 
 Do you want baby James? 
 Yeah, we want him. 
 We want him. 
 Thank you. 
 Matron. 
 Have you told Chris that he's your son? 
 I saw him here. 
 Have you told him? 
 That's not your business. 
 But you're his mother. 
 Why wouldn't you want him to know that? 
 What we want and what is right aren't always the same thing. 
 I thought you would have worked that out by now. 
 But why is it right? 
 Why? 
 I don't understand. 
 Why is it better that my babies never know where they came from? 
 What harm could it do to let me know where they are? 
 I don't want to steal them. 
 I just... 
 I want to know. 
 Newborn children are a blank slate ready to be written on by their environment. 
 Disruption of that process only leads to pain for all concerned and the stalled development of the child. 
 How can anyone know that? 
 It's science. 
 Many books have been written. 
 I can lend you some. 
 But there has to be something of me in my baby girls. 
 They can't be totally blank. 
 The Nazis thought that. 
 It's called eugenics. 
 They were wrong. 
 Do you know where my babies are? 
 No, and I wouldn't tell you if I did. 
 You have to move on, Vivian, for your own good. 
 I am trying. 
 I am. 
 I just can't stop thinking about them. 
 That will change when you get married and have other children. 
 
 
 
 Hello. 
 Pattie! 
 Ah, look. 
 They're multiplying. 
 Lilah's friend down the hall had to race off because there was an emergency, and there was nobody else to take him. 
 Have you applied for any jobs? 
 Ah... no. 
 So no jobs, and my room's a nursery? 
 Martha, it won't be for very long. 
 You keep saying that and nothing changes. 
 Pattie, you've been looked after your whole life. 
 It's got to stop. 
 Stop bludging off me. 
 The Prime Minister, John Gorton, comes forward to lay his wreath, as we remember those who landed at the Dardanelles to be baptised with fire and sword, and lay down their lives in the service of king and country to safeguard the safety of their loved ones, that they might live on in peace. 
 A grateful nation remembers and sal... 
 Early start, sir. 
 Plenty to do, assessments and whatnot. 
 Ah, Matron, I know we spoke earlier about funding for Stanton House. 
 Yes. 
 I'm afraid the board has decided to review that operation altogether. 
 Review? 
 You mean close? 
 These straitened times. 
 But you can't! 
 What will happen to all my girls? 
 Where would they go? You can't! 
 There are other institutions. 
 But, sir...! 
 It's not immediate. 
 You've got three weeks. 
 Annie! 
 Annie. 
 Yeah? 
 Annie, look. It's you. 
 Oh, are they running that already? 
 Hey, look. 
 Hey! Spunky girl! 
 Thanks, Viv. 
 Dr McNaughton? 
 Bright-eyed and ready to go? 
 Yes. 
 I thought your written assessments were very good, by the way. 
 Thank you. Can I change my 9:30 interview for a later time? 
 No, no. The schedule's settled. 
 There's something very important that I have to do. 
 Your assessment isn't some trivial moving feast. 
 I'm adopting Jim Marsh's baby, and it's happening at 9:30, so... 
 That's... that's ridiculous! 
 You're a single woman. 
 Jim Marsh and I are married. 
 You saw the autopsy report on the baby's mother. 
 She had broken bones, scars on her back. 
 Her father was responsible for those injuries. 
 I couldn't let him get that baby. 
 You got married to save the child? 
 Yes. 
 Or to allay your own guilt over not saving his mother? 
 11:00. 
 Can you keep this to yourself? 
 Don't be late. 
 It doesn't have to be common knowledge. 
 Spinner takes the bets against kip. 
 Over 70 bucks down against kip. 
 You right? Anyone else? 
 Nope? Rightio! You all done? 
 Come on, spinner. 
 Spinner's got the kip. 
 Up they go. 
 Go, spinner! 
 Yay! 
 Two heads! Spinner wins. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, mate. 
 You've seen a girl before. 
 Chat amongst yourselves. 
 I'm going to have a drink. 
 Your 20. There's another 20 for being a sport. 
 Thank you. 
 What's up? 
 Got a head like a beaten favourite. 
 Did your grandparents teach you to gamble, Chris? 
 No. They were God-botherers. 
 Roll in their graves. 
 I've got 100 down! 
 100 down taking bets against heads. 
 What about you? 
 I'll take your money. 
 Oh, will you? 
 Yeah, I will. 
 Anymore bets? Rightio. Anyone else? 
 Hundred! 
 Go, spinner! 
 Heads! Hey! Spinner wins again. 
 Sorry, mate. 
 Here we go. This is the big one. 
 I've got 200 bucks against heads. 
 I'm taking all of your money here. 
 Alright. You? 
 Yeah. 
 You're going to try and take my money, mate. There you go. 
 Good luck. 
 Spinner's got the kip. 
 Come on, spinner! 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! 
 Oh! Two heads. Sorry. 
 Spinner takes it again. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Toss them again. 
 Eh? 
 They didn't spin. Toss 'em again. 
 Mate, it wasn't a floater. 
 It was a fair toss. 
 You're cheating. 
 Bullshit. Get your... 
 Get him outside! 
 Get off! 
 Look here, mate, eh? 
 Oi! 
 Leave him alone. Rats! 
 Chris. Chris. 
 Your self-assessment - it's, uh, different to the way your colleagues have assessed you. 
 In a good way? 
 Well, you say that you've got excellent communication skills and a determination to improve. 
 Your colleagues seem to be in general agreement that, um, you're an idiot. 
 Joan too? 
 No, she was kinder. 
 Confidence - that's important. 
 I liked your self-assessment. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 You've been seen running around with a black girl. 
 Pardon? 
 A filing clerk or some such. 
 Do you want to be a doctor in this place? 
 Yes, sir. Of course. 
 Put a stop to it. 
 Hey. 
 What can he see? 
 Well, he's still learning to focus, but if you get up close, he can see your eyes. 
 You'll need to get some things for him - a proper cot, a chest of drawers. 
 I can get on it today. 
 Shops are closed today. 
 Well, I can go borrow some things from the hospital. 
 I'll do that right away. 
 Thank you so much, Eleanor. 
 Thank you. 
 Best of luck. 
 Thank you. 
 Bye. 
 See you. 
 Bye. 
 Oh! 
 So you'll be right with him? 
 Yep. He feeds every four hours. 
 Yes. I've made up three bottles of formula and then if you run out, there's boiled water in the fridge. 
 I've labelled all of it. 
 No worries. 
 OK, when you change him, make sure to use the... 
 ..nappy rash cream. 
 Alright. Hey, see you round, eh? 
 OK. Well, you, you can call me, or I suppose I can... 
 Have a good day at work, dear. 
 Alright, dear. Um... 
 I'll see you later. 
 Bye. 
 Hey, it's you and me now, bub. 
 Big day. 
 Your colleagues consider you to be an excellent diagnostician but you're inclined to emotional attachment. 
 I'd say that's fair. 
 And bossy. 
 Bossy! Really? 
 Lacking humility is probably a better way of putting it. 
 Not altogether attractive in a woman. 
 Yes. I'm sure that's true. 
 But, overall, I'd say you've had an outstanding few months. 
 Well done. 
 Dr Millar, just a moment. 
 There is one subject we haven't covered, and we probably should - the death of Gail Mathieson. 
 I thought that had already been... 
 Who's Gail Mathieson? 
 She was a poor girl who exsanguinated after a late-diagnosis placenta previa, New Year's Day. 
 You were responsible for that? 
 At the time, the girl was unidentified, but we now know that she's the daughter of Gregory Mathieson. 
 Greg Mathieson? The businessman? 
 Yes. 
 You guys go. I'll see you out there. 
 Hey! I think I did alright. 
 Oh! What did I tell you? 
 Yeah, your advice was good. 
 Got me through, I reckon. 
 Hey, er... 
 I think you're great. 
 You too. 
 It's just... I don't think this is going to work. 
 Us. 
 I just don't have time for a girlfriend. 
 I don't want to be your girlfriend. 
 I told you that before. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 Just... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm not. 
 Hurry along. 
 Your mates are waiting. Yep. 
 You told me the board had dealt with Gail's death. 
 At the time I thought we should let it go. 
 But now we've found out who she was... 
 We knew who she was weeks ago. 
 I thought you liked honesty and transparency. 
 This is because I married Jim Marsh, isn't it? 
 Why would I care about that? 
 It's probably time you told him about the details of his girlfriend's death, though, don't you think? 
 Yes, it probably is. 
 Do you love him? 
 You did alright today. 
 How was the march? 
 Fine, thank you. 
 What's this? 
 An address you're not legally entitled to know. 
 Is this where my babies are? 
 If you make any kind of contact I'll deny all knowledge of how you came by it. 
 Oh, Pattie... Shirley, I can't. 
 I've got to run some errands... 
 No, no, I'm not going to ask you to do anything. 
 I just want you to have this. 
 Why? 
 You've been a godsend to me and Ben. 
 Without you, I'd be handing him over to strangers. 
 No, I can't take that. 
 Of course you can! 
 In fact, you should go into business. 
 More and more women are working. 
 They need someone reliable to look after their kids. 
 You'd be great at that. 
 You're already the face of women's lib round here. 
 Maybe you should start living it. 
 Oh. 
 Hey, Martha, I've got rent. 
 You got a job? 
 Um... yeah. I think I did. 
 Are you OK? 
 I'm great. 
 You got me and I got you. 
 Let's go out. 
 There you are. 
 I was hanging out downstairs. 
 Work to do. 
 Is this where my daughter stayed when she was here? 
 Yes, briefly. 
 Thank you for taking care of her. 
 I think we might have that drink. 
 You look like you've had a few already. 
 I only see these blokes once a year. 
 Still the best mates I've got. 
 Social worker's given my grandson to Jim Marsh. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I hadn't heard. 
 He got married to the doctor, apparently. Sealed the deal. 
 What doctor? 
 The woman, Millar. 
 She's the problem. 
 I'd be a good father to him, I would. 
 I'd make sure he had everything he wanted. 
 I'm sure you would. 
 How do I get him? Tell me. 
 Once an adoption order's been finalised... 
 There's got to be a way. 
 You've been doing this for years. 
 It would have to be demonstrated that the baby's parents weren't fit and proper guardians. 
 You need money? 
 Pardon? 
 You make this happen for me, I'll give you whatever you want. 
 This one just around there. 
 Tuck his arm under. 
 You want a beer or something? 
 Oh, no, thanks. 
 Dinner? It's chops and mash. 
 No. 
 How was your thing? 
 My what? 
 Your test thing. 
 Alright. 
 Did you pass? 
 Not sure yet. 
 I'm sure you did. 
 Well, if you're here to check up on me, we're doing fine. 
 Actually, I, um... 
 I came to... 
 You know what? 
 I'd love to stay for dinner. 
 Stay the night. 
 If you want. Let's play pretend. 
 Do you drink wine? 
 I drink anything, but I won't have any tonight, thanks. 
 Oh. I ordered... 
 I just ordered some champagne. 
 Oh, Pete. 
 Save your money. 
 I can't go with you. 
 I should have proposed first. 
 Oh, no. No, no, not at all. 
 I don't even think I'm ready to get married anyway. 
 Look, if it's about, like, a job or something, I mean, I can... 
 I'll find one for you. 
 You wouldn't have to leave until then. 
 I have to stay here, in the city. 
 Well, come whenever you want. 
 I'll be there. 
 You'll wait for me? 
 Sure. You're the girl I want. 
 Dance with me.
