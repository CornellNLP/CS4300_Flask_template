 So tell me, are you planning on finishing your medical degree? 
 I don't know. 
 Possibly. 
 When the time comes, you could do your residency here, under me. 
 Your baby died three days ago. 
 Annie's gone. 
 Where? 
 Don't know. 
 Doctor? You're the doctor that delivered my baby. 
 My baby died. 
 We're like the pet dog the Yanks took to their bullshit war. 
 Hey honey. Wanna spend some time with a man? 
 What? 
 See what you got, come on! 
 Johnny, leave it! 
 So you're against the war but in favour of fighting? 
 Have to get back before Matron knows I've been out all night. 
 So what if she did? 
 Would it be that bad? 
 She can't know about you. 
 I've told you that.

 Your check-up's in six weeks, but please come into the clinic if you have any trouble at all with the breastfeeding. 
 Oh, I've stopped. The young doctor said a bottle would be best. 
 Did he? 
 Patrick : She said, "Doctor, am I more likely to get pregnant 
 "if my husband wears boxers instead of Y-fronts?" 
 I said, "Love, you'd have a better chance if he didn't wear anything." 
 Uh, why did you tell Mrs Morton to stop breastfeeding? 
 Uh, thought she'd find the bottle easier. Oh. But she's 19 years old. 
 Her husband's just been laid off work. 
 So now they're going to need to find money for formula. 
 If they can't afford to provide for a child, then they shouldn't have had one. 
 He'll make a great obstetrician. 
 Top of this class. 
 He treats people like cattle. 
 Those formulas, they don't have enough iron in them. 
 They're full of sugar. 
 Better than they used to be. 
 Yes, but if breastmilk is available, it should be used. 
 Wait, let me get you a soapbox. 
 I'm pretty sure you left one around here somewhere. 
 You know I'm right. 
 If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 
 Finish your degree. 
 You've only got one exam left. 
 I can't. 
 I've been told I have to repeat the last two years of my studies if I want to graduate here. 
 Two years? 
 Mmm. 
 They're not going to bend the rules for a midwife. 
 Wait, which exam was that? 
 Obstetrics. 
 Ironic, really. 
 Hardly feels real. 
 Only seven more weeks. 
 Well, depending on the size of this baby, Is that safe? 
 You just stick to your plan. 
 Something you want me to do, Matron? 
 Thank you. 
 I've got you a job as a records clerk. 
 It's simple clerical work. 
 Shouldn't take you long to get the hang of it. 
 Are you sure you got the right girl, Matron? 
 All your friends will be heading back to jobs and families when they leave here. 
 It's time you started thinking about your future. 
 So, filing. 
 You know I only went to Grade 6? 
 You can read and write, can't you? 
 I can recite the alphabet backwards if you want me to. 
 Could be quite useful. 
 One of these signed authorisation slips is required before a file goes out. 
 When it comes back, it's filed in alphabetical order, names facing outwards. 
 This section is the maternity and social workers archives. 
 All the information is strictly confidential. 
 Any questions, Nurse Tracey will be happy to help. 
 Hello. 
 (WHISPERS) 
 She has no sense of humour. 
 Sister Millar! 
 What are you doing at seven o'clock tomorrow morning? 
 I will be going to bed after an all-night shift. 
 Why? What are you offering? 
 Well, there's a board meeting here, and the dean of studies, Bob Flannery, will be there. 
 Now, he's agreed to meet you to talk about sitting your final exam. 
 How did you manage that? 
 He's a mate. And I gave you a glowing reference. 
 Really? 
 Mmm. 
 I... 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank me yet. 
 Bob's a bit of a dinosaur. 
 Ah! Coming from you... 
 I'll expect four legs and scales, then. 
 And you'll need to impress the rest of the board if you're thinking of applying to be a resident. 
 A resident? 
 Yes, they'll want to be sure you're prepared to stay here. 
 I am. 
 But by far the most important thing, don't make me look bad. 
 I won't. 
 You can manage that by yourself. 
 Annie? 
 Annie! 
 Oh, I've been so worried about you. 
 Where have you been? 
 It's so good to see you. 
 Moving around. 
 I couldn't face home. 
 I didn't think my room would still be here. 
 You been paying for it? 
 No, you don't need to... 
 I'll pay you back. 
 Annie, you keep... 
 You keep your money. 
 So, what are your plans now? 
 (SIGHS) Find a job. 
 Keep busy. 
 Stay out of trouble. 
 Sit down. 
 Man : Get your back up on the wall! 
 Man 2 : Alright down there? 
 Man : Come have a look at this. 
 Man 3 : That's my room! 
 Hey! 
 Excuse me! What's going on? 
 Joan : What's going on? 
 It's OK. 
 We're just looking for someone. 
 Who? 
 You can't just barge in here like this. 
 What is this sh1t? 
 He's a photographer. 
 I'm sorry, this is really inappropriate. Boss! 
 Joan : Out. 
 That's not him, but he was there. 
 Man : Did you see this officer assaulted earlier this morning? 
 Man 2 : I didn't see a thing, man. 
 Man 1 : Bring him. 
 Let's see if we can jog his memory. 
 (GROANS) 
 Shirley : Johnny! 
 Hey, beautiful. 
 Look at you. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Johnny, what's going on? 
 Nothing. 
 Hey, do you want to see 'Hair'? 
 'Hair'? The musical 'Hair'? Yeah. 
 I've got a friend at the Metro. 
 He can get, um, free tickets. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought it was sold out. 
 Not if you know the right people. 
 Yeah, that would be wonderful. 
 OK. 
 What happened to your shirt? 
 You look like no-one owns you. 
 Go inside and change it. 
 Yeah, yeah, I will. I will. 
 Do you promise me everything's alright? Cross my heart, hope to die. 
 Pattie : How about that time that we went on that horse and carriage, we went down Collins Street? 
 Would you do that for me? 
 Oh, that's so gallant. 
 Pull up stumps, Pattie. 
 Guess what! 
 I get to work in the Records Office. 
 Cool! That's good for you. 
 Pattie : So, uh... 
 Robert. 
 You're definitely coming, Robert? 
 You just don't know when. 
 Robert, listen. 
 Man : At the third stroke, it will be 9:33 precisely. 
 Pattie... 
 I don't want to talk about it! 
 At the third stroke, it will be 9:33 and... 
 Annie : Hello? 
 You're too late, sweetheart. 
 Auditions finished half an hour ago. 
 I was actually looking for Johnny Lowry. 
 He works at the bar. 
 Haven't seen him. 
 Oh. 
 Well, when you do see him, could you tell him that Annie was looking for him? 
 And that it's all clear at the Oasis. 
 What? 
 What were the auditions for? 
 They're over. 
 I could sing something for you. 
 Maybe some other time. 
 (SINGS)

 OK, you can sing. 
 I don't need a singer. 
 Well, I really need a job. 
 My dresser just ran off with the bass player. 
 Wages stink, hours are long. 
 Can you sew? 
 Saw Shirley's, from 1956. 
 She had a baby girl here when she was 15. 
 That's why her and the matron are so tight. 
 That's pretty careless. 
 Imagine having to come here twice. 
 When I get out of here, I am never coming back. 
 Yeah, we know. Robert's coming. 
 Martha : So you going back home when this is over? 
 Oh, I hadn't decided yet. You? 
 Got no home to go to. 
 Pattie : Well, what happened to your family? 
 Dunno. 
 Nuns told me to forget about them Oh, that's just awful, Martha. 
 This is me and my mum, from before they took me to the mission. 
 She's got your smile. 
 Yes. 
 Pattie : Aww! 
 Imagine if there was something about your mum in those files. 
 What? 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Yes? 
 Doctor, I just... Oh... 
 Is this OK? 'Cause I can... 
 Of course. Come in. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Annie. I... 
 I got a job, so I can, um, start paying you back the money that you gave me. 
 There's no need. 
 Why did you...put me up in that posh hotel for a week and give me that money? 
 Ah. Well... 
 Seemed like you'd had a rough time and, uh... it seemed like you deserved a break. 
 ..that you wanted? 
 Oh. 
 The idea of a residency is very exciting. Thank you. 
 I'm sure. The first woman here. 
 I'm sorry. Are we interrupting? 
 No, no, no, it's fine. Come in. 
 Annie, this is Eva. 
 This is Dr McNaughton's wife. 
 I'm sorry. Of course. You... 
 You two haven't met. Stupid. 
 Well, I won't keep you. 
 Thanks again. 
 Of course. 
 It's lovely to meet you, Mrs McNaughton. 
 Likewise. 
 Wow, she's... 
 Annie : She's really beautiful. 
 Yes. We think so. 
 Well, I'll see you later. 
 OK. 
 Annie : 'Bye. 
 So how was her, uh, check-up? 
 Clean bill of health. 
 Ooh! Still says he doesn't know the bloke who hit you. 
 Why don't you help him with his memory? 
 Maybe he's telling the truth. 
 And maybe he isn't. 
 Do it. 
 If we don't send a message to these arseholes, they'll think they run the joint. 
 You get that? That kid there has done nothing wrong. 
 You're a cop. You got hit. 
 Someone pays. That's how it works. 
 Let's go, boys.

 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Why are we meeting at the stage door? 
 Because I organised us some backstage passes. 
 That way, we can meet the cast and see the show. 
 Something like that. 
 Oh, can I...? 
 Wow. How cute. 
 'Bye! 
 'Bye. 
 And there was no-one on the end of the phone. 
 So do you think Robert doesn't exist? 
 Or maybe he's dumped Pattie and she just doesn't want to admit it. 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Who's that? 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) 
 We're looking for a man who we believe might be involved with one of your girls. 
 My girls aren't allowed contact with men outside their families. 
 His name is Johnny Lowry. 
 He's a friend of Shirley Ryan's. 
 No, that can't be right. 
 This man assaulted my officer, Matron. Where is Miss Ryan? 
 She's...out. I don't know when she'll be back. 
 Well, call us as soon as she is. 
 Such a great show. I loved it. 
 Do you think you could get me tickets? 
 I will try. 
 Thank you for taking me. 
 I have to thank Jason. 
 Jesus. 
 Hey, man, what happened? 
 They're looking for ya. 
 Shirley : Who? 
 Who's looking for you? 
 Mike? 
 Shh. 
 The cops. I'm sorry. 
 I had to tell 'em. 
 Tell them what? 
 Nothing. 
 Tell me. 
 There was a f... 
 There was a fight at the demo. 
 What'd you do? 
 I... I hit a cop. 
 What? 
 I didn't mean to. It just happened. 
 You lied to me! 
 I'm sorry. I... 
 You bloody idiot! 
 Baby, please. 
 No. 
 I was going to tell you. 
 When? When they hauled you away? 
 You're a fool. 
 (GROANS) 
 Shirl. 
 Hey. 
 Get away from me! 
 Oh, God! 
 Get Dr McNaughton. 
 It's gonna be OK. 
 She needs to stay calm. 
 But it's too soon. Can you stop it? 
 She's 32 weeks. 
 She's having contractions. 
 I'll take it from here. 
 I'd like to stay. 
 You, out. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Can I help you? 
 Can you pass on a message for me? 
 Shirley Ryan. 
 Tell her I love her. 
 Please, take a seat. 
 Joan : Contractions were four minutes apart. 
 There's been some slowdown but not much. 
 Shirley? 
 Shirley? 
 Shirley. 
 We're giving you alcohol to slow down the contractions, so you might feel quite drunk right now. 
 Will it stop the baby? 
 Patrick : You need to stay as calm as possible. 
 Do you understand what I'm saying? 
 Yes. 
 Close your eyes. 
 Try and get some sleep. 
 Shoes. 
 My cue's coming up. 
 Be a doll, chop me a line? 
 Cocaine. In my bag there. 
 It's illegal. 
 Not in here, it isn't. 
 We have a special backstage dispensation. 
 (SNIFFS) Whoo! 
 Showtime.

 Woman : Thank you so much for waiting.

 Frances. 
 Don't sit up. You need to rest. 
 There's a young man in the waiting room. 
 He told me to tell you he loves you. 
 Frances, I'm sorry. 
 Let me guess. 
 He's the father of your child. 
 I remember a letter you wrote me. 
 One of many. 
 Allowing you and your husband to make a new start without the burden of an unwanted child. 
 Do you remember that? 
 Johnny followed me down here. 
 You didn't tell him to leave. 
 I tried. 
 Not hard enough, apparently. 
 You lied. 
 I didn't. 
 You certainly made every effort to conceal the truth. 
 What's the difference? 
 Have you ever intended to return to your husband? 
 Yes. 
 I did. 
 I...do. 
 You have to believe me. 
 Why would I do that? 
 Man : Johnny Lowry! 
 Please. Not now. 
 You're under arrest. 
 No. 
 Shirley! 
 Let go of me! I can't leave! 
 No, stay... 
 Johnny. 
 Stay here! 
 That is my child! No! 
 Matron : Shirley! 
 Shirley! 
 (GROANS) 
 Man : Get him out of here! 
 Johnny : No! 
 Oh! 
 Shirley : Oh, God, no! 
 (GROANS) 
 OK. 
 Big push on the next contraction, Mrs Ryan. Big push. 
 You have to push, Shirley. 
 You have to. 
 The baby is coming whether you like it or not. Please. 
 One big last push. 
 Ready? Ready? Push with me. 
 (SHIRLEY GROANS) 
 Joan : Push. 
 The baby's almost here. 
 Forceps. 
 Scissors. 
 There we go. You did it. You did it. 
 You did it. Deep breath. 
 OK, we've got a flat baby here. 
 Someone note the time. 
 Patrick : Susie, can you pull the screen? 
 OK, there's no heart rate. He's not breathing. Start compressions. 
 One, two, three. Bag. 
 One, two, three. Bag. 
 What's wrong? 
 Patrick : One, two, three. Bag. 
 One, two, three. Bag. Stop. 
 Still no heart rate. Continue. 
 One, two, three. Bag. 
 One, two, three. Bag. 
 One, two, three. Bag.

 (BABY CRIES) 
 (GASPS) 
 Good boy. 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 What's that? Your confession. 
 It's attempted murder. 
 What? No. 
 I didn't confess to anything. 
 Did you hear Mr Lowry's confession, Constable? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I didn't mean... (GROANS) 
 (COUGHS) 
 Put him in a cell. 
 He's very premature, so his lungs are underdeveloped, but he's breathing on his own, so that's a very good thing. 
 Is he gonna live? 
 We'll give him the best care possible. 
 You need to rest, OK? 
 He's in the nursery. 
 I can show you if... 
 No, no, no, I can't. 
 Are you sure? 
 Well, I want to get you expressing. 
 We'll keep up your milk supply. 
 Do you want me to try to get word to Johnny? 
 (SIGHS) Yes. 
 He should know. 
 After she's expressed, let's give her something to help her sleep. 
 You gonna be right for the meeting? 
 You're good at this. 
 Honestly, this time of night, I don't know why I even bother. 
 Oh, here, let me. 
 That one. 
 Now, where's Mama's little... 
 Whoa! 
 Be careful! 
 Hey. Sit up. 
 Stand up. Sit down. 
 Oh... 
 Are you alright? 
 No, I'm not bloody alright! My ankle. I'll see if there's a doctor. 
 Forget the bloody doctor. 
 There's an audience out there. 
 Go on, get out there. 
 Cover for me. 
 I can't. 
 Yes, you can. Go on! Yes! Go!

 (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) 
 Why did you miss your final exam in London? Seems a very odd decision. 
 It was for personal reasons. 
 I had a family crisis here, and in hindsight, My heart rules my head when family is concerned. 
 Well, if you were to be allowed to sit this exam, what are your plans when you complete your degree? 
 I'd like to specialise - obstetrics. 
 It's an area I feel very passionate about. 
 We put a lot of time and money into training our specialists. 
 You're an attractive woman. 
 Who's to say you wouldn't throw that investment away with a good husband and babies of your own? 
 I'd like to think I could manage a career and a family. 
 Spoken like a true modern woman. 
 Thinks she can do everything. 
 Well, if I can't have everything, I'd settle on being allowed to sit my last exam, rather than wasting my time repeating my last two years of study to satisfy some stupid rule. 
 Sir. 
 (KNOCKS) Morning, Sister. 
 But I don't get it. Where's my file? 
 All the Aborigine files were removed. 
 In accordance with the dissolution of the Aborigines Welfare Board. 
 Unlikely. You haven't seen her for 17 years. 
 What if there was? 
 Can you help me get it back? 
 That's impossible. 
 I have no idea where it is. 
 I know you help girls. 
 Like you helped Shirley. 
 My only interest in the girls who come here is the babies they're carrying. 
 The fact they have made appalling choices is completely irrelevant to me. 
 I don't believe that. 
 Well, you should. 
 You can't keep me here forever. 
 You charge me. 
 Bail me. I don't care. 
 I need to see my son. 
 You know, my mother always hated the idea of me being a cop. 
 Lies awake at night, worrying that I'm gonna get... 
 I will sign anything you want. 
 Actually, I've been doing a little bit of digging into draft resisters. 
 Apparently, the government's looking for you. 
 Poor little thing. 
 He looks so alone. 
 Those sheets are for the general ward, aren't they? 
 Yep, we were just on our way there now, actually. 
 Shirley! He's gorgeous. 
 Did Johnny really hit the copper? 
 Yes. I believe he did. 
 Matron : Vivian! 
 Go. 
 He's survived the night. 
 That's encouraging. 
 Have you seen him? 
 No. 
 Do you have the final consent form for me to sign? 
 No papers for you yet. 
 Your baby's not healthy enough to be adopted. 
 What'll happen to him? 
 Depending on his health, he'll go to an orphanage or a charitable home. 
 It's not something Or there is one other option. 
 You could keep him. 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 You should be in bed. 
 Now, I've left messages for a lawyer friend about Johnny. 
 It's too late. 
 Once the government get their hands on him, they'll throw him in military prison. 
 I saw your son this morning. 
 His breathing's improved. 
 He's a real little fighter. 
 Come on. 
 Let me take you to see him. 
 If I see him, I won't be able to give him up. 
 Shirley, you're his mother. 
 Premmie babies, they do better with He knows your voice. He's been listening to you for months. 
 I know about premmie babies. 
 He might never be right. 
 You can't give up on him. 
 I know you must think I'm a monster. 
 I'm not brave enough to manage by myself with a sick child. 
 And even if I had Johnny, he couldn't cope. 
 Well, he'd think he could, but he couldn't. 
 So... 
 It's time. 
 Turn around. 
 Where's the van? 
 Where's the van? 
 Alright. 
 Let's go. 
 You and me. 
 I'm not gonna fight ya. 
 Yes, you are. 
 If I win, you go to military prison. 
 If you win, you get to leave. 
 Leave how? 
 This is your charge sheet This is a set-up. 
 The Defence Department doesn't know you're here yet. 
 You have my word. 
 Come on, man. I... 
 (GROANS) 
 Please don't leave me hanging. 
 Well, Bob said you were very opinionated and that you asked a lot of excellent questions. 
 Unless you pass your obstetrics exam next month, he really doesn't see how you'd be able to apply to be a resident here. 
 I can sit the exam? 
 He said yes? 
 Yeah. 
 I... 
 Thank you. 
 Look at you.
