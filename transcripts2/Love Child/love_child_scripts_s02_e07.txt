 You might be the loveliest girl I've ever met. 
 You've been seen running around with a black girl. 
 Do you want to be a doctor in this place? 
 Yes, sir. Of course. 
 Put a stop to it. 
 I don't think this is going to work. 
 You don't seem to understand how serious this situation is. 
 Tell me why you weren't with her. 
 I don't have to tell you anything! 
 You have no right to judge me. 
 You and Chris have been a wildfire. 
 He says that he loves me. 
 You're going to find out sooner or later. 
 He's Matron's son. 
 Matron, I know we spoke earlier about funding for Stanton House. 
 Yes. 
 I'm afraid the board has decided to review that operation altogether. 
 You mean close. 
 I should have called for you in the first instance. 
 What's that - an admission of liability? 
 Yes. It was an error in judgment. 
 I now pronounce you man and wife. 
 Jim Marsh and I are married. 
 You got married to save the child? 
 Yes. 
 Or to allay your own guilt over not saving his mother? 
 The death of Gail Mathieson. 
 You were responsible for that? 
 At the time the girl was unidentified but we now know that... she's the daughter of Gregory Mathieson. 
 The social worker's given my grandson to Jim Marsh. 
 How do I get him? 
 Tell me. 
 It would have to be demonstrated that the baby's parents weren't fit and proper guardians. 
 Make this happen for me. 
 I'll give you whatever you want. 
 Here are the rules of the Ouija board - we put our fingers on the glass and ask our question to the spirits. 
 What kind of spirits? 
 Dead ones. 
 OK, fingers on the glass. 
 This is great, like when we were all together in Stanton House. 
 Only enjoyable. 
 Spirit, are you there? 
 Spirit... 
 Oh! 
 It's here! 
 Viv, you go first. Ask something. 
 Oh. 
 Um, will I be a nurse? A good one. 
 Oh! 
 Shirley, ask your future. 
 I don't need a ghost to tell me I'll be a lackey at the club for a while yet. 
 I'll go. 
 Dear spirit world, will I be successful one day and have my own account at Mark Foy's and sign my cheques with a really fancy pen? 
 I knew it! I knew it! 
 My turn. 
 Will I marry Johnny Farnham after he's crowned King of Pop and live in a mansion and eat fondues every night? 
 Was that Deanna? 
 Annie's baby? 
 Hang on. 
 Don't you want to know if I'm going to marry Johnny Farnham? 
 Annie! 
 You coming in for the sBeance? 
 No, I've got to put Deanna down. 
 Come in when she's asleep. 
 It'd be great. 
 The gang back together. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 Are you alright? 
 You look a bit pale. 
 Yeah. I'm just... I'm really tired. 
 Have you told Chris about Matron? 
 No. And, you know, you should have never said anything to me in the first place, 'cause it was none of your business. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought I was protecting you. 
 I thought it would be better for you to know. 
 Yeah, well, it wasn't. 
 I was happy. 
 Well, you still can be... 
 Can't you? 
 Yeah. 
 The ghosts are getting antsy. 
 What are you doing? 
 Martha. 
 What do you want? 
 Can we go somewhere? 
 Coming in for the sBeance? 
 He can't. He's leaving. 
 Look, I know I'm not your favourite person right now but there's something you need to know. 
 I found your mother. 
 I tried to contact St Bridget's Mission where you grew up but the place was shut down in 1963 and the records went into storage. 
 I got my father to pull a favour with a mate in the government. 
 They're both Masons. 
 You told your father about me? 
 I said it was for a friend. 
 Did you say your friend's an Aboriginal girl? 
 No. 
 Anyway, I found out your mother changed her name and she moved a couple of times. 
 It took a while but... that's where she lives. 
 I thought you didn't want a bar of me. 
 No, that's not right. 
 I was a drop-kick. 
 So you want me to be your girlfriend now? 
 I just want to say I'm sorry. 
 You're using this stuff to say you're sorry? 
 I spent years looking for her and you just turn up with it! 
 Who gave you the right? 
 Don't you want the option? 
 I'm not your charity case, Simon! 
 One of us could be a bigamist, huh? 
 You're not taking this very seriously. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Divorce is a very serious business. 
 I'm just saying one of us is going to have to stand up in a courtroom and say that we were at fault. 
 That's what this list is about. 
 Number four - you've got to admit to being a violent drunk. 
 Oh! 
 That's a great advertisement for a doctor. 
 Why don't you just admit to being unfaithful? 
 Do I have to say who with? 
 You could have been a serial adulterer. 
 We've only been married six weeks. 
 Oh, you've worked hard. 
 All I'm saying is it's going to be easier for you than for me. 
 I don't want to be made out to be some sort of seductress. 
 Is the judge going to be happy if I stand up in court and admit to being on the ran-tan with a different woman every night? 
 The whole point of this thing is so I get to keep him. 
 There is another way, you know. 
 We could just leave things the way they are. 
 That wasn't the deal. 
 It could work but. 
 I'm happy. 
 You're happy. 
 Great job, girls. And again. 
 Even bigger smiles this time. 
 You're all looking fabulous. 
 Let's try a different pose now. 
 Can we get some more powder? 
 Is this for the 'Daily Mirror'? 
 Half-page ad. 
 Should bring the punters in. 
 Here, test shots. Have a look. 
 Looking good. You've done well. 
 Thanks. 
 OK, girls, we're going to take a break. Ten minutes. 
 Hey, you don't look too flash. 
 Have a rough night? 
 Deanna's restless. 
 She's teething. 
 Hey, let's go away. 
 Where? 
 I don't know. 
 Somewhere warm. 
 Cairns. Darwin. 
 A holiday? 
 Or we could move there. 
 Move? 
 Yeah. 
 And do what? 
 Just... go. 
 Annie, I've got stuff happening here. 
 This is the first real job I've had in my life. 
 You too. 
 You've got great stuff happening. 
 Hm. 
 Why would we chuck that in? 
 Is this a test? 
 Hey, we can be happy, can't we? 
 I don't know if I can. 
 Matron, sorry. 
 What is it? 
 I've had an idea. 
 Always cause for alarm. 
 I want to give classes to the Stanton House girls. 
 Not about contraception, not what Joan used to do. 
 Classes about giving birth and adoption and all that. 
 You're not a teacher. 
 Yes, but I've been there. 
 I know what they're going through. 
 I know a way to make their lives easier. 
 And yours too, in the long run. 
 The long run. Hmm. 
 Please. 
 I think it would make me a better nurse. 
 We'll see. 
 Sir. 
 Good morning. 
 Morning, Frances. 
 I have been working my way through the mid-year nursing staff assessments. 
 Oh. We just finished ours. 
 In terms of my teaching work, I've been looking at trying to improve adverse outcomes on the wards. 
 Mm-hm. 
 I was reminded of the unfortunate death of that girl on New Year's Day, Gail... 
 Mathieson. 
 Yes, that's it. Terrible business. 
 Indeed. 
 Dr Millar didn't call on you when she should have. 
 Procedure wasn't... 
 Is there a point to this? 
 There was no inquiry. 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 The case was presented to the board and dismissed. 
 Dismissed? 
 Yes. 
 A patient lost their life under Dr Millar's care. 
 It was clearly negligence. 
 Turns out it wasn't. 
 Still, knowing Joan, as we both do, I find it extraordinary that she didn't take some responsibility. 
 At the very least resign... 
 Leave it alone, Frances. 
 You don't agree? 
 Joan did the right thing. 
 She gave me a letter admitting culpability but she really has no case to answer. OK? 
 Of course. 
 Joan. Hey, can you come here? 
 Hello, there. 
 Who taught you how to make this? 
 No-one. Just made it up. 
 Listen, can you take a look at this? 
 I was washing him with the, you know, wash cloth thing. 
 Hm. 
 I think I pressed to hard. 
 It's just the soft spot on the baby's head, where the bones haven't joined up yet. It's really nothing to... 
 It kind of started pulsing. 
 It's fine. 
 It's nothing to worry about. 
 I've told you that, Jim. 
 I understand your concerns but perhaps I can help. 
 Jim, this is Patrick McNaughton, head of obstetrics. 
 G'day. 
 Nice to meet you. May I? 
 Yeah. 
 It's quite normal to see a fontanelle pulsating, but the bones will join up soon enough. You're sure? 
 Yeah, he'll be fine. 
 Great. Thanks. 
 That's exactly what I said. 
 Yeah, well, got to get to work. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 Yeah. You too. 
 Joan. 
 You have a lovely family. 
 Hi, Annie. 
 Hi. 
 Hello, Deanna. 
 You take a seat. 
 Thanks. 
 So... your blood results have confirmed anaemia. 
 It's an iron deficiency. 
 It explains your headaches and all your fatigue. 
 Is it bad? 
 Not if you eat more red meat, it's not. 
 But there's an underlying cause for your anaemia, Annie. 
 You're pregnant. 
 How could I let this happen again? 
 How could I be so stupid? 
 Annie, accidents happen. 
 Just try to relax. 
 No, how am I...? 
 This can't be right. 
 There has to be... Can we...? 
 We need to retest. 
 Because I can't... 
 OK. I can retest if you like. 
 I can retest but... Look... 
 Oh, my god! 
 You, you're a great mother. 
 I can't have this baby. 
 I can't. 
 What will the baby's father have to say about that? 
 Does he have a family, sisters, a mother, grandparents? 
 Just tell me who I need to talk to. 
 Annie, those procedures are not performed at this hospital. 
 They won't allow it, alright? 
 Look, I don't want to be the one to tell you what to do but I don't want you to make a decision too quickly about this. 
 I was there. 
 I was where you are, in London. 
 And I try not to regret it. 
 Go home. Get some rest. 
 And then you come back and you see me. 
 OK? 
 Dr Millar was responsible for the death of my daughter? 
 As she admits. 
 So she could have been saved? 
 It's possible. I'm very sorry. 
 Is this criminal behaviour? 
 Let me guess. The hospital's denying all responsibility? 
 They will do whatever is necessary to prevent a scandal. 
 So how does this get me my grandson? 
 Make a claim of negligence, then you can force a settlement that requires on official reprimand of Dr Millar. 
 Once that's done, I'm sure the Welfare Department would also be interested in the fact that she married the baby's father a few weeks later. 
 A sham marriage with just one purpose - to stop me getting the baby. 
 You only have to demonstrate they're not fit and proper parents. 
 You're a resourceful woman. 
 I can be. 
 And if memory serves me correctly, you also promised me some... 
 Resources? 
 A deal's a deal. 
 I don't understand you. 
 You are such a disappointment, Simon. Dad... 
 Do you know much we've invested in you? I know. 
 You're just pathetic. 
 Grow up and be a man! 
 Dad. 
 Asking your father and his mates to do you more favours? 
 Just told him I failed my mid-term assessments. 
 I'll be repeating. 
 There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Guess what happened this morning. 
 What? 
 The squatters down at Victoria Street donated all of these toys. 
 Oh! 
 My mum taught me how to sew on one of these. 
 I wonder what she's doing now. 
 Probably wondering what you're doing. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 But I'll show her. 
 I'll be successful and she'll read about me in the newspaper. 
 And she's going to feel so proud. 
 Pattie...? 
 Will you come somewhere with me? 
 It's a nice house. 
 Looks like it's from a picture book. 
 Well, are you gonna knock? 
 How did she get to live in a place like this? 
 Yeah, maybe she works here. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Is that her? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, she's so... 
 Fair? 
 Fancy. 
 That pant-suit's French. 
 I'm sure it is. 
 Hey, I'm here. 
 You can do this. 
 Hey. 
 Yes? 
 It's me. 
 Martha. 
 Martha. 
 I can't believe it! 
 You're here! 
 I'm up at the Cross, work at the hospital. How long...? 
 We can't do this now, not here. 
 Why? What's wrong? 
 Who is it, Carla? 
 Carla? Is that your name now? 
 It's really best you leave. 
 But I just got here. 
 Carla? 
 It's the girl from the club, about the raffle tickets. 
 I have to go back in now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Wait! 
 This is you and me, before I was taken away to the Mission. 
 I don't know anyone in that photo. 
 Thank you so much for stopping by. 
 Have a nice afternoon. 
 Why didn't she invite you in? 
 What did she say? 
 Martha, was that her? 
 It was her! 
 We'll get to that after smoko. 
 This the board we're doing? 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 If you want to get Barry, I'll get Mack and we'll work on this one after lunch. 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 Oh, hello. 
 Hello! 
 Hello. You haven't been climbing up ladders with him, have you? 
 Yeah, he loves it. Eh? 
 Up, down, up, down, like Luna Park. 
 Not like these blokes. 
 You don't know what to make of a bloke with a kid, do you? 
 Not in a kangaroo pouch. 
 You look like a bloody nancy. 
 Um... I need to get some things from your place. 
 I should stay at the residents' quarters every now and then. 
 Don't be a killjoy. I'm expected to stay there and I have to tread carefully. 
 Stay one more night.

 No, I'm not interested. 
 I don't believe a word you say. 
 It's Mathieson. 
 Well, try whatever you like! 
 Prick. 
 He reckons Gail's death wasn't an accident. 
 He's got a letter from you saying you're responsible. 
 Either he's forged it or he's lying. 
 Hey, you got time for a cuppa before you go? 
 Would she have died anyway? 
 There's no real way of knowing. 
 An earlier diagnosis would have allowed for a caesarean section but, as it was... there was no time for that. 
 New Year's Day. 
 You didn't think to mention it? 
 Is that why you agreed to marry me? 
 I wanted to help you. 
 If you didn't feel responsible for Gail, would you still have married me? 
 You wouldn't! 
 Yes, I would have! 
 I wanted you to be James's father. 
 No! You knew nothing about me! 
 You hunted me down, lectured me about right and wrong, stuck your nose in, all to make yourself feel better! 
 Because I made a promise to Gail! 
 Mathieson says he can use this to take the baby. 
 He can't! 
 He says he can. 
 No! We'll fight him. 
 Oh, Joan, you're being...! 
 No, I'll go, eh? 
 You'd better get to work. 
 That's what's important. 
 How does Mathieson know about my involvement in Gail's death? 
 I didn't know he did. 
 Except you gave him my letter of liability. 
 What? No... 
 How else would he have gotten it? 
 I have no idea. 
 You are the only person with any reason to do something like this. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I saw you at that assessment meeting. 
 You couldn't wait to publicly humiliate me. 
 That was a mistake. I'm sorry. 
 I should never have told them about your involvement in Gail's death. 
 Liar! 
 You are such a liar. 
 I was stupid. I was childish. 
 You can't stand the fact that your wife left you because of what happened between us. 
 It has nothing to do with Eva. 
 And I'm the one who pays for it! 
 You're not being unreasonable! 
 Mathieson is going to take the baby! 
 Do you hate me that much? 
 No. I could never hate you. 
 You must! 
 Why else would you do this? 
 I love you! 
 What are you doing? 
 I was waiting for you. 
 What does it look like? 
 Have you been here all night? 
 Since 3:00. I was worried. 
 Well, don't be. We're going out. 
 I'll come with you. 
 One minute you're all over me, asking me to run off with you, the next, you won't even open the door. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Chris, can you please just leave me alone? 
 I thought we were having a good time. 
 That's what it's all about, isn't it? 
 Having a good time. 
 Look, if you want to crank things up a notch, I'm cool with that. 
 It's just... I'm not used to a full-time thing with a chick. 
 Chris, please just... 
 Annie! 
 Annie! Just please tell me what's going on. 
 No, I don't want to talk about it. 
 Annie! Tell me, please. 
 OK. I'm pregnant. 
 Pregnant. 
 Mine? 
 That's great! Far out! 
 You and me... 
 No, no, no. It's not great. 
 It's awful. 
 No, I'll look after you, OK? 
 You won't have to worry about a thing. 
 I'm not keeping it. 
 What? 
 Don't talk bullshit. 
 No, no, no, I'm not keeping it! 
 Stop saying that, Annie. 
 No! No! 
 Why? Why? 
 Why can't we? 
 Obviously these are just rough. 
 I would do bigger diagrams if I was giving a talk. 
 The girls don't need to know any more about s*x. 
 I do. 
 Scoot. Laundry. Now! 
 I told you it's not about s*x. 
 It's about contractions and how long it takes and what the baby's doing. 
 And then afterwards how you feel. 
 I have rehearsed this moment for decades but I just couldn't find the words. 
 It was the hardest thing I've ever done, to hand my little boy to another woman, not knowing when I'd see him again. 
 Why did you give me away then? 
 Because... 
 Your father was gone... 
 Wait. 
 Russell. 
 He was a farrier. 
 Beautiful man. 
 Killed? 
 I never heard. 
 I had nothing, Chris. 
 You were losing weight, jaundiced, hungry, sick all the time. 
 You nearly died. 
 It was all for you, to protect you. 
 Protect me? 
 By leaving me... with a couple of sadists? 
 She treated me like sh1t. 
 And her old man used to beat me with a brass buckle for the smallest thing. 
 Even when you could have come back... you didn't. 
 I didn't want to ruin what you had. 
 I've never stopped loving you. 
 Forgive me. 
 We'll do it. 
 It'll just be us, a family. 
 It's that simple, is it? 
 Please. 
 We'll go away. 
 Like you said, we'll go up north to Cairns and start again. 
 We could go to the other side of the world and she's still going to be your mother. 
 Our baby's grandmother. 
 So you're going to punish our baby for that? 
 It's not even a baby yet. 
 Annie, Annie, it is. It's growing... 
 No, it's not. 
 It's the size of a pinhead. 
 I'm not having that woman's grandchild. 
 I'm not. 
 It's better if we just call it quits. 
 The club's all yours. 
 I think you were easier to find than I was. 
 Got time for a chat? 
 What did they tell you on the Mission? 
 That you and my dad were drunks, lazy, didn't want me. 
 That's not true. 
 We adored you. 
 Yeah, so you let me go. 
 Let you go? No. 
 Your dad was up the river, catching dinner. 
 I was still at work. 
 I used to housekeep for a very well-to-do widow. 
 I missed the bus. 
 I was only half an hour late. 
 The black cars had come by then, rounded you and a few of the other children up. 
 Your dad chased those black cars to the end of the road. 
 But you were gone. 
 He died a few years later, his heart broken. 
 Both of us walking ghosts. 
 They took you from me. 
 My only baby. 
 How did you end up in the city then? 
 I worked the switch at the GPO, passed myself off as Carla, a Spaniard from a good family in Perth. 
 Changed the way I spoke, dressed, ate, made new friends, married Ernest. 
 Did you even look for me? 
 Of course I did, for years. 
 Is there anything else you need to know? 
 My birthday. 
 22 February 1950. 
 Oh, if only you would have come to me ten years ago. 
 Let's just start from now. 
 I can't. 
 If I tell Ernest about you, he'll know that everything I've ever said is a lie and I'll lose it all. 
 What about me? 
 We could see each other... in secret. 
 You're my mother. 
 I'm so sorry, Martha. 
 Bad day? 
 Oh, the worst. 
 You? 
 Bad few weeks. 
 Hoping yesterday was the worst of it. 
 Hey, I was going to share this with some of the boys. 
 Don't look at me. 
 I don't know where they are. 
 You don't even live here anymore, do you? 
 I do now. 
 Swig? 
 It's a bit early for that, isn't it? 
 Yep. 
 Go on then. 
 Can I ask? 
 I think I just found, and then lost, the two most important people in my life. 
 Ah. 
 Careless? 
 To say the least. You? 
 I've lost out. 
 I've seriously lost out. 
 I heard you didn't pass your mid-term assessments. 
 I don't care about that, although Dad's coming back this afternoon to help plead my case. 
 That's embarrassing. 
 Should you be...? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I reckon. 
 OK. 
 Have you ever thought... if I could just take one moment of my life and do it again, that everything would be OK? 
 All day today. 
 Doesn't help much, does it? 
 Nah. Nah. 
 Johnny won. He's the king. 
 Oh, it must have been all of our extra votes. 
 I should have told my mum I was married to him. 
 She'd have me in her fancy house then. 
 You can go back and see her. 
 She's already been here. 
 What? When? 
 This afternoon. 
 Made me feel like nothing. 
 I dreamt about her all these years. 
 Martha. 
 Look at those dresses. 
 Oh... Good afternoon. 
 I'm Patricia Saunders. 
 I'm Martha's friend. 
 Yes. 
 Well, I just wanted to say that Martha is a really good person and she's been through a lot but all us girls at Stanton House, she really keeps us together. 
 What's Stanton House? 
 It's a home for unwed mothers. 
 She has a baby? 
 Ah, that's her story to tell. 
 It's not mine. 
 Is your husband home? 
 No. 
 So we can talk. 
 Good. 
 He's the problem, isn't he? 
 My situation is more complicated than you realise. 
 It must be, because to turn Martha away is... 
 It must be. 
 You've already lost her once. 
 Dr McNaughton. 
 Mr Mathieson. 
 Thank you for coming. Please. 
 I thought the head of department would have a bigger office than this. 
 Ostentation is a very unattractive quality, especially in a doctor. 
 Now, I hear that you have a letter of Dr Millar's. 
 I do. 
 I don't suppose you'd tell me how you came by it. 
 I don't suppose you'd tell me how you know I have it. 
 No matter. You've got it - that's the main thing. 
 I'm very sorry for your loss. 
 If I bring a charge of criminal negligence, will you support it? 
 Of course. What happened to your daughter was a travesty. 
 Why was that woman in charge of my daughter? She's a novice. 
 Desire to prove herself, hubris. 
 I think the letter makes those inferences quite clear. 
 Do you have it? 
 "Although I was explicitly instructed by Dr McNaughton not to act without clear guidance from him, I chose to anyway." 
 If I bring this charge, it could damage the hospital. 
 There's a chance you'll be caught in the crossfire. 
 I wouldn't think so. 
 To be honest, I'd rather not put you through it. 
 Or anyone else. 
 I just want my grandson. 
 I know. 
 But I can't see that happening. 
 And how does it feel to be Queen of Pop? 
 It's great, of course, but the pressure has been absolutely immense. 
 Because you won last year too, didn't you? 
 I did, and the year before. 
 And let me tell you, it doesn't get any easier waiting for those votes to come in. 
 And I heard a rumour that you and a certain King of Pop are going to tie the knot. 
 That's right! 
 Johnny asked me last night and he gave me this lovely ring. 
 That must have cost a mint! 
 Lucky he's a king, eh? 
 And do you have any...? 
 I told Ernest... my husband. 
 He wants to meet you. 
 Oh. 
 Shh. Shh. 
 Hey, shh. 
 You're OK. 
 Mate, there's a bloke you've got to meet. Come with me. 
 No, I can't. 
 He wants to give us money, man, for the campaign. 
 Nah, look, I just put the kid down. 
 He's talking thousands of bucks. 
 What? Who is he? 
 A politician from the other side. 
 How long will we be? 
 Half an hour. 
 Alright. I'll get Briony from upstairs to look in. 
 She's having a party. 
 What did you say to Chris? 
 Why? 
 He was off the air. 
 Gave me the keys and told me the club was all mine. 
 He quit? 
 Yeah. 
 Congratulations. 
 Oh! Come here and dance with me, you beautiful creature. 
 Jim let you off the leash? 
 I am officially off the leash. 
 I am leash-less.
