 "Mrs. Colin Ryan". 
 -Are you married? 
 Come on. 
 Colin sent some photos. 
 I thought you'd like to see them. 
 Your baby died 3 days ago. 
 Complications from whooping cough. 
 I have lied for you, I have falsified records, all because you needed to give your wife a child who couldn't wait. 
 You know what, I'm still not gonna sleep with you. 
 Never. 
 Ever. Ever.

 Why would they send me the birth certificate? 
 I know, it seems like a cruel joke, but I thought you'd want it. 
 Wish I got to hold her, just once. 
 What's next? They gonna send me the death certificate, too? 
 No, that will be issued to the baby's adoptive parents. 
 I've seen it, anyway. 
 What? Uh, when? 
 The day Matron told me my baby had died. 
 She showed it to me. 
 Why would the Matron have the death certificate? 
 Your baby would've died in another hospital.

 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Found this underneath my pillow. 
 It's my file, from the Aborigines Welfare Board... 
 I have no idea how you came by that. 
 I'd keep it to yourself if I were you. 
 The thing is, it's got all this stuff about me going to the mission and then working for Mr Wilder, but there's nothing about my parents in here. 
 I doubt there's a conspiracy. 
 The Aborigines Welfare Board has been slapdash for years. 
 But there's this one piece of paper that has an address on it, in Parramatta. 
 Could this be my mother's address? 
 I advise you to focus on your future, Martha, not your past. 
 You're due to start work in the office now, aren't you? 
 Yes, Matron. 
 Sister Millar... I've swapped you over to the nursery. 
 Dr McNaughton's been here all night and needs a break. 
 I'm sure, as an aspiring doctor, you'll be a big help. 
 Sure. 
 Matron, Annie Carmichael was sent her baby's birth certificate yesterday. 
 It's a cruel system. 
 Is she alright? 
 Yes. 
 She said you showed her the baby's death certificate. 
 I don't know why she'd say that. 
 So you didn't? 
 Of course not. 
 Why would I have it? 
 Do you know which hospital the baby died in? 
 St Vincent's. 
 Whooping cough? 
 Yes, it was a distressing day for all concerned. 
 Annie's confused, that's all. 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 Down to Biochem, please. 
 And thank the technician again for me? 
 What are you testing for? 
 Bilirubin levels. They've been on the rise for the past 12 hours. 
 You look terrible. 
 Thank you. 
 Have you had any sleep at all? 
 Just keep the milk up to him. 
 He'll be fine. 
 I'll put money on this one. 
 Patrick : Out! 
 It's cool. 
 I was just... 
 I said get out! 
 You're a walking bloody infection! 
 Get him outta here! 
 I'm sorry, I'm ... 
 He is the father. 
 Shirley, your husband has been injured and flown home from Vietnam. 
 He's in Concord Repat Hospital. 
 Shirl, hey... 
 Joan says he's got my eyes. 
 Shirley? 
 I've tried to see you a hundred times since he was born. 
 They keep telling me you're asleep or busy. 
 I don't know what to say to you. 
 We have to give him a name. 
 He has to have a name. 
 Johnny, there's every chance he will either die or be retarded. 
 I don't believe that. 
 Yeah, well, what you believe and what's real aren't the same thing. 
 Ever. 
 You're so full of fairytale endings. 
 One needy child is enough. 
 Don't make me cope with two, please. 
 So the plan...we made... to be together? 
 It was your plan... not mine. 
 Annie! Annie! 
 Hey, there you are. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Rick Allen. 
 I was at the show last night, in the front row. 
 Right. 
 Can I help you? 
 Uh, yeah, I hope so. 
 I thought you were really great last night. 
 Thanks. 
 What do you want? 
 I'm putting a record together and I'm looking for some backups and, yeah, I reckon you'd be perfect. 
 (CHUCKLES) Right. 
 This is a leg-pull, right? 
 No, no. 
 No. 
 You have a great voice, and I want you to work with me. 
 Joan : St Vincent's? 
 Do you have an epidemiologist on staff that I could speak with? 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, hello, I'm calling from the Department of Health. 
 I was wondering if you have the details of any infant fatalities from whooping cough over the last six months? 
 Great. 
 Really? 
 You're 100% sure? 
 Thank you. 
 (HANGS UP) 
 Joan : Matron lied. 
 I called St Vincent's. 
 No deaths from whooping cough over the last four years. 
 You lied. I thought we were meeting for a boozy lunch. 
 I was looking forward to an afternoon of role-play. 
 You in your nurse's uniform, me playing patient. 
 Phillip! 
 I think Annie's baby might be alive. 
 That's a hell of an allegation. 
 I know. 
 That's why I'm talking to you about it. 
 You're not even trying anymore to hide the fact that you're using me for free legal advice. 
 That's because you're the only person I can talk to about this. 
 You are the only person I trust. 
 How can we find the death certificate of Annie's child? 
 It's difficult business trying to find something that you don't think exists. 
 Maybe you should try and find an adoption record. 
 How do we do that? 
 'We'. (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, you're such a tease. 
 I'll need all of Annie's medical files. 
 Thank you. 
 I have to go back to work. 
 Hey, be careful. 
 You're playing with people's lives here. 
 He's a little jaundiced. 
 That's common in young babies. 
 Is it bad? 
 It usually fixes itself, not always, which is why we're doing blood tests every few hours. 
 Why is it happening now? 
 He was doing well. 
 You have Rhesus negative blood and your baby is Rhesus positive. 
 Sometimes, antibodies from your blood can cross over into his and start chewing up his red blood cells. 
 This is my fault. My blood. 
 No, no, no, it's nobody's fault. 
 We're all badly designed when it comes to blood types. 
 Thank you, Kerry. 
 (TENSE MUSIC) 
 That address could be anything. 
 Somebody could've dropped it in the file by mistake. 
 Don't be such a wet blanket. 
 Matron says I should just forget it. 
 But what if your mum's there? 
 I know. 
 But why isn't there a name or something? 
 Let's go and find out. 
 Go to Parramatta? 
 How? It's all the way out of the city. 
 Get the train. 
 Can't be that hard. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 We'll all go. 
 It'll be an adventure. 
 What if I have to go to the toilet? 
 Oh, come on. 
 What if Matron finds out? 
 What if we get hit by a meteor? 
 Don't sheets go in the basket? 
 Oh, no, I wanna steal this one. 
 It's in really good condition. 
 I'll go with you. 
 We'll be there and back before the sun goes down. 
 Pattie'll cover for us, won't you, Pattie? 
 They sent me away. 
 Oh, what's happened? 
 He got some blood tests back. 
 He started shouting and then he sent me out. 
 Draw me 10 mils of blood, please. 
 What are the numbers? 
 Too high. 
 Please, what's happening to him? 
 Is he gonna die? 
 No, he won't die. 
 Can you wait outside, please? 
 Thank you. 
 10 mil, please. 
 Matron : Dr McNaughton, I've brought Dr Parker down from Paediatrics... 
 That won't be necessary. 
 Bryce, sorry you were dragged down here. 
 You've been here for over 30 hours. 
 I said get out! 
 This is my patient. 
 I'll decide who treats him. 
 Are we clear? 
 You will not die. 
 What are we up to? 
 160 mils drawn, 150 replaced. 
 You're going to collapse. 
 Please let me take over. 
 You're not a doctor yet. 
 Patrick, what are you doing? 
 Is his colour better, or am I going crazy? 
 Mm, it's better. 
 You might be going crazy as well. 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 Patrick : Think we're done. 
 It's good. 
 He's good. 
 You're a good colour now, aren't you? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Shirley? 
 Thank you... for everything. 
 Mr Lowry? 
 Your son is making slow progress. 
 You deserve to know that. 
 Thank you. 
 I keep thinking I'll leave for a while, but... 
 Yes, you're attached. 
 But you need to understand, you have no rights in this situation. 
 I know you think I'm some stupid kid... a home-wrecker. 
 I do. 
 I love her. 
 Yes, yes. 
 And she's dealing with a very sick baby, her husband is back in the country, and she has the maternity blues. 
 So, what good are you? 
 Colin's back? 
 She didn't tell you? 
 Well, what does that say? 
 If you love her, if you really  love her, you'll accept that she'd have none of these problems if you'd never met her and chased her until she slept with you. 
 That is what happened, isn't it? 
 You're poison in her life. 
 Grow up. 
 Oh, we can't go to Parramatta now. 
 It'll be too late. 
 Rubbish. Only take us an hour to get there. 
 Once Matron goes back into the hospital, we can duck out. 
 Pattie : So, what's the excuse again? 
 Oh, for goodness sake, Patricia! 
 Could you just tell me? 
 I have to use the toilet. 
 I was called up by the ward sister to clean up after an accident. 
 Martha has to go take files to another part of the hospital. 
 Which...which part of the hospital? 
 Who cares? 
 Make it up! 
 She's gone. Let's go. 
 Ooh, uh, Pattie? 
 Yeah, no, I've got it. 
 I know what to say. 
 Can you lend us some money for the train? 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Come in. 
 Have you come for the keys to the room? 
 You can have it for a few more days. 
 Are you going to see your husband? 
 Yes. 
 Wear the purple dress. 
 You look good in that. 
 I'm not interested in creating a good impression. 
 It broke my heart when you turned up here again. 
 After all those years, making a decent life for yourself. 
 I know. 
 How'd you let it happen? 
 I was alone. 
 I'm not good at that. 
 And Johnny was... 
 Are you going to tell your husband about the baby? 
 How can I not? 
 The survival rate for babies as young as yours is very low. 
 I know. But he's strong. 
 He's a fighter. 
 If you tell your husband and the baby dies, you'll be left with nothing. 
 Eva and I... we had another daughter... born five weeks premature. 
 Yes. 
 Grace. 
 Your wife mentioned her to me. 
 She lived for 32 hours. 
 Beat every complication except the Rhesus factor. 
 The doctors didn't pick it. 
 You can't project your own loss onto every sick child. 
 You'll go mad. 
 I know. 
 Well, I'd better apologise to Dr Parker for yelling at him. 
 Mmm. 
 Maybe. 
 Apologies are overrated. 
 Yeah. 
 He's an idiot. 
 He is, isn't he? 
 He's an idiot.

 Sorry, I meant to be home. 
 It's been a crazy couple of days. 
 Could've called. 
 I did. You didn't answer. 
 Oh, hello, darling. 
 How are you? 
 I've packed. 
 So if you have a shower, we can go. 
 We're driving up to the farm... for Mum's birthday. 
 Ohh... You have to come. 
 I can't. 
 You've been at work for over two days. 
 I need to be on call. 
 Why? 
 Premmie baby. 
 Newborn Rhesus. 
 Same disease that took our little one. 
 Are you the only doctor in that bloody hospital? 
 Eva, don't do this. 
 You're the head of the department, not some junior resident. 
 Sometimes I think you'd rather be married to that place than to me. 
 I didn't plan it this way, OK? 
 But if I'm the best person to deal with the situation, then I have to do it. 
 A baby's life is at stake. 
 You have no idea how charming I had to be to get this. 
 Tell me you don't find these meetings the tiniest bit sexy? 
 Oh, great, that's exactly what I need. 
 What now? 
 I'll give my friend the information. 
 He might let me spend an hour or two with some of the files. 
 You get a knock on your door tonight, I expect you to answer in a trench coat and nothing else. 
 I am not doing all of this for fun. 
 Goes without saying. 
 I'm doing this for Annie. 
 You bet. 
 She deserves to know the truth. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I love you. 
 OK, you got five seconds to say something, otherwise I'll know I've made an idiot of myself. 
 I'm gonna be on 'Bandstand'. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 Rick Allen's going on tomorrow and he wants me to do a duet with him. 
 I'm gonna be on live television. 
 Wow, that's... 
 Oh, that's amazing! 
 Well, we'll have to tune in. 
 I'm terrified. 
 No, don't be. You'll be great. 
 I'm sure you'll be great. 
 You think so? 
 Yes. 
 You're gonna knock their socks off. 
 Viv : Does it ring any bells? 
 Martha : It's green. 
 It's been a long time. 
 Might've had four coats of paint since you were here. 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 Maybe we should go back. 
 Hey, hey, hey... your mum might be in there. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Maybe we should leave a note or something. 
 I didn't bring a paper and pencil. 
 Come. 
 (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Woman : Yeah? 
 Viv : Oh, hi. 
 Hi, my friend and I are looking for a woman that we think might've lived here once. 
 What was her name? 
 Daisy. 
 Viv : Daisy. 
 Woman : Oh, never heard of any Daisy living here. 
 How long ago? 
 17 years. 
 Woman : No, well, we've only been here for three years. 
 Some old bloke was here before that. 
 Do you wanna come in for a cuppa? 
 Viv : Sure. Thanks. 
 Sorry, sorry. 
 Martha! 
 Bloody stupid idea. 
 Maybe she knows something. 
 No! 
 I should've listened to Matron, not you. (CRIES) 
 Martha! 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) 
 You should be in the laundry. 
 I had to go to the toilet. 
 And where's Vivian? 
 Think she was, uh...called up to the third floor of the hospital. 
 There was some kind of accident and she has to help clean up one of the wards. 
 What kind? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't suppose Martha was recruited for this vital work as well? 
 I saw her just a couple of minutes ago. 
 Think she was just carrying some files... to the office. 
 Alright. 
 Patricia? 
 They've gone to Parramatta, haven't they? 
 Yes. 
 How's your mum? 
 She still crook? 
 Um, yes. 
 It's been a long few months. 
 Mm. 
 You must be sick of hospitals by now. 
 Did a fair bit of thinking on that stretcher bed in the middle of the bloody jungle. 
 Sure. 
 Been a pretty ordinary husband, Shirl. 
 Yeah, you put up with a lot. 
 That's all gonna change. 
 You need to rest, get better. 
 Hey. Hey, hey. 
 I mean it. 
 We draw a line today, and everything that happened before that, that's over, gone. 
 Start again. 
 Oh, I have to get back to Mum. 
 How long do you think you'll be here? 
 Couple of weeks. 
 Then maybe we can go back to Brisbane, eh? 
 Come again tomorrow? 
 Sure. 
 (POIGNANT MUSIC) 
 Colin? 
 I've had a baby. 
 ..that was a lie? 
 I needed an excuse to be here. 
 How long you been seeing this other bloke? 
 About a year. 
 How did it start? 
 Oh, it doesn't matter. 
 Matters to me. 
 He was putting posters up on telegraph poles... in Fortitude Valley. 
 He, um... 
 He what? 
 Told me I was beautiful. 
 That's all it took? 
 I didn't jump straight into bed with him. 
 When did ya? 
 It was... (SIGHS) 
 ..about a week later, I think. 
 I can't remember exactly. 
 Did you have s*x in our bed? 
 No. 
 No. 
 I promise you. 
 What's his name? 
 I'm not telling you that. 
 Tell me. 
 No. 
 You don't need to know. 
 What's he do, then... for a crust... eh? 
 Some high-flyer? 
 Pots of bloody cash? 
 He's a barman... and a draft resister. 
 How old is he? 
 You're hurting me. 
 So you're shacked up, are ya, with this kid and your baby? 
 No. 
 The baby's sick, in Kings Cross Hospital. 
 (SIGHS) I should be with him. 
 I have to go back to my son. 
 He needs me. 
 Did you ever love me? 
 I wanted to. 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC) 
 Martha, can you talk to me? 
 Nothing to say. 
 We should go back another time. 
 You never know. 
 I do know. Crazy's not good. 
 It's bullshit that you can afford. 
 I can't. 
 I don't wanna listen to you anymore. 
 Matron : Girls. 
 Patricia tells me you've been very busy around the hospital today. 
 Oh, yes, Matron. 
 You've got some catching up... 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SOMBRE MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 Joan : You'll be disappointed. 
 No trench coat! 
 Oh. 
 You're right. 
 I'm disappointed. 
 Hi. 
 I... You expecting someone else? 
 No. 
 I was just, um... A friend. 
 But... No, nobody. 
 Come in. 
 Thank you. 
 Have you slept yet? 
 House is too quiet. 
 Eva's taken Rose away for the weekend. 
 Um...well... 
 Can I get you a drink or something? 
 Sure. 
 I wanna run an idea by you. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Survival rates for premature babies are bloody terrible, right? 
 And everyone's been focusing on humidicribs, neonatal wards filled with high-tech equipment. 
 Well, I say we let the other hospitals worry about that stuff. 
 Right, but hasn't there been a funding submission to the board... 
 Exactly.  Right, we take that and we put it into research. 
 I know that I can lift survival rates 50%, 60%. 
 You can? 
 Mm-hm. 
 And you can help me. 
 But there's a reason those babies don't survive. 
 Come on, that's bullshit. 
 Why the hell do you wanna be a doctor if you don't wanna beat the odds? 
 You have a Messiah complex. 
 Playing God, it gives you a thrill. 
 It does. 
 I'm just trying to save the lives of children. 
 (SCOFFS) Mm. 
 Same thing, cloaked in martyrdom and humility. 
 I came here to share an idea with you. 
 No, you came here so that I would fall at your feet and call you a genius. 
 God's little helper. 
 Really? 
 So, God can pour himself another drink... for God's sake. 
 (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) 
 (EMOTIONAL MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 (GROANS) 
 What time is it? 
 It's almost 9:00. 
 Mmm. 
 You needed the sleep-in. 
 Hmm. 
 I should get out of your hair. 
 Yes, you should. 
 Annie's singing on 'Bandstand' today. 
 Annie Carmichael? 
 Mm. 
 So where are we now? 
 You and me? 
 I don't want to destroy your marriage. 
 So we go on like it never happened. 
 Oh, well, isn't that how it usually works? 
 I don't know. 
 I've never done this before. 
 Are you going to break my heart? 
 If you pass your final exam, I'd still be honoured to have you as my resident next year. 
 Well, I'm not sure how we'd do that now. 
 You should go. 
 Good luck today. 
 Thank you. 
 Shirley : They say he could take the breast soon. 
 Did you tell your husband? 
 Yes. 
 What now? 
 I suppose he'll go back to Brisbane and sue for divorce. 
 No doubt. 
 This is for you and the baby. 
 I sold everything. 
 What? 
 Whatever you need... whatever it takes... I'll get it. 
 And you owe me nothing. 
 You're Colin? 
 Wouldn't have picked you as Shirley's type. 
 In my experience, she likes men. 
 You're not coming in here. 
 And how are you gonna stop me? 
 You can hit me, if you want. 
 I deserve it. 
 But you are not seeing my son. 
 (BABY BURBLES) 
 Hey. 
 You came back. 
 What's a family break when we're not together? 
 And I thought we should talk. 
 Annie : Oh, look at the time. 
 I'm gonna be late. 
 What if I'm not ready for this? 
 You are. 
 Sometimes you just have to close your eyes and take the plunge. 
 Besides, all the girls are going to be watching you. 
 So you can't chicken out now. 
 Good luck. 
 Break a leg, or whatever they say. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, knowing my luck, I probably will. 
 Go. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I didn't have time to go through the mountain of stuff at Births, Deaths and Marriages, so I went looking for death notices in the paper, just to rule it out, and I found this. 
 Your boss lost a baby. 
 I know that. 
 Yeah, but look at the date. 
 It was only three weeks before Annie had her baby, and now he's got another one. 
 (TROUBLING MUSIC) 
 Brian Henderson : Thank you. 
 Top of the 'Bandstand' this week. 
 I think it's a pretty good one. 
 And I now declare this 'Bandstand' to be well and truly open. 
 Hey. 
 I'm so sorry you didn't find her. 
 Doesn't matter. (SNIFFS) 
 I got by alright this long. 
 I've got something for you. 
 Here. 
 It's a glory box. 
 Oh, that...that's yours! 
 No, it...it's for you. 
 See? 
 We've got sheets and some lovely tea towels and doilies, and a Royal Albert cup and saucer. 
 Who's gonna marry me, Pattie? 
 Well, somebody lovely will. 
 You're so beautiful. 
 What about you and Robert? 
 Viv : Hey! 
 Annie's on! 
 Bill and Boyd - nice to see they still make a lovely couple, really. 
 They're not the only pebbles on our beach, of course. 
 We've also got Rick Allen and Annie Carmichael. 
 She looks beautiful. 
 (Cover of Petula Clark's "One In A Million" plays)

 I can't believe I know someone on TV. 
 She looks wonderful.
