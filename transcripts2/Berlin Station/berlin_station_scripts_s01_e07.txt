 Previously on "Berlin Station"... 
 Our agent, Bora Osman, has asked losava to send one of his relatives to Syria. 
 Clare Itani? 
 She will be acting as the ISIL bride-to-be. 
 I'm a bride for the Caliphate. That's the setup. 
 Get a confession, and we finally bring down losava. 
 Okay, I'm in. Sign me up. 
 You are involved with Clare. 
 It is out of the question. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Golda : You made some important people in Tel Aviv very happy. 
 You want to be nearer to your son, don't you? 
 Good. 
 Robert : Where the f*ck is her husband? 
 What the f*ck are you doing here? 
 DeJean is here. 
 Can we get him out of there? 
 Call it off. Someone's nabbed Iosava off the street. 
 You're coming with us, or we will kill you both! 
 What? 
 Get them out of there, now! 
 Abort. I repeat, abort. 
 [ All screaming ] 
 sh1t! 
 Down! 
 In pursuit, blue van... Berlin plates, Bravo-Walker-Alpha 2-6-4-7. 
 They're not in the van. They ran a bait and switch. 
 A rendition in the middle of an operation? 
 What the... What's the matter with you?! 
 I'm gonna get our officer back with or without your f*cking help, and when I get her back, I resign. 
 Hey, hey, stop, stop. 
 f*cking find her. 
 Stop, stop. 
 We got to f*cking find her. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 We have to find her.

 Daniel : Hector? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 [ Panting ] 
 Ruth losava just made contact. 
 Yeah, I-I understand. 
 But as fast as you can. 
 Hey, everybody, listen up. Listen up. 
 At 3:38 A.M., Ruth losava contacted headquarters via an anonymous Internet video call. 
 That's 6 hours and 35 minutes after the abduction of Clare Itani. 
 She has also requested a call with this station at 4:00 A.M. sharp. 
 Now, Johnson and his team are working to trace the origins of the call, but right now, we're negotiating. 
 And I just... I want to make it clear to everybody here, uh... 
 I'm gonna do whatever I can to bring her back here safe and sound, okay? 
 Now, I know it's late, and I want to thank everybody for hanging in there. 
 Langley will help facilitate the call. 
 So, what, we stand around for a pep talk while you, what, negotiate? 
 Ruth losava is an ISIL radical. 
 They don't negotiate. They decapitate. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 You want us to go after Clare with guns blazing? 
 Jesus Chri... I... You know, I would have thought you'd have learned your lesson after you recklessly inserted yourself in the mall with an unapproved weapon. 
 Someone had to shore up your poor judgment. 
 Oh, give it a f*cking rest, Hector! 
 What kind of f*cking incontinent, geriatric call was that in the first place, sending Clare to the gallows? 
 Get out. 
 Gladly. 
 Hector, we need you. 
 There is no f*cking "we" anymore, Daniel. 
 [ Door shuts ] 
 All right, four minutes. Back at it. 
 Let me go after him. 
 No, I need you here, Daniel. 
 If Hector's out there acting on his emotions, snooping around, and this thing leaks before we find Clare, she's as good as dead. 
 Okay, all right, just tread lightly. 
 Lock him down and keep me in the loop, okay? 
 You got it. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 And you are? 
 Paul. 
 Paul. 
 In quotation marks, I assume. 
 I see you've taken your own security precautions. 
 But I have the disadvantage of not knowing your real name while you know mine. 
 That puts us on distinctly unequal footing. 
 Well, I hope that tonight's concerns will have little to do with you or me. 
 You people can be very polite when you want something. 
 You want something, too. 
 I don't see why we can't be civil about it. 
 Well, Paul, my husband, Aleksandre, has been abducted off the street on the whim of civilized men like yourself. 
 When you turn over my husband, she's yours. 
 And Aleksandre and I are given safe passage to Syria. 
 Well... 
 That transaction's easier said than done. 
 We have certain steps that we have to follow, such as proof of life... 
 Confirmation that she's alive and unharmed. 
 And I need the same of my husband. 
 I'll make contact again in two hours. 
 Frau losava... 
 Robert : Wow. 
 Please don't tell me that's the new face of ISIL. 
 Danke. 
 What, you're following me? 
 Yeah, kind of. 
 I just wanted to say there is a "we" here... 
 You and I, whether you like it or not. 
 All right. I take it you have a plan. 
 Same as Frost... Find Clare. 
 What, you know something he doesn't know, or are you counting on the good Lord to show you the way? 
 All right, so Frost put you up to this. That figures. 
 No, I put me up to this, not just for your sake, but for Clare's. 
 Daniel, you're a company man. 
 There's no harm in that. So was I once. 
 But tonight, you're in bad company. 
 And you're no good to anyone running around Berlin on some cockeyed manhunt. 
 Well, who's gonna find her if I don't? 
 We're on it, Frost's on it. The Germans are looking... 
 The Germans?! f*ck the f*cking Germans! 
 Okay, f*ck the Germans. You clearly have a better plan. 
 What's step one? Get wasted? 
 I want to find that van. 
 Oh, go on. 
 Robert's guys did a sweep. They didn't find anything. 
 They think it was a decoy. 
 Jesus. 
 He gets in one f*cking car chase, and he thinks he's f*cking Vin Diesel. 
 I'd prefer to look for myself. 
 What... What, the impound? 
 [ Siren wails in distance ] 
 That's my boy. 
 I'll drive. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's MI6, the Russians. 
 Who else would want losava? 
 You're forgetting one name... us. 
 I haven't forgotten, but not during an operation. 
 Clay : There you are. 
 I'm sorry for the circumstances. I just received the cable. 
 We're at a loss here, Clay. 
 I am well aware. 
 The last thing we want is to lose an asset in the field. 
 Clare is not an asset. She's one of my people. 
 And the only way to get her back is to swap for losava. 
 We can't trade what we don't have. 
 We just got word Romanian Intelligence was involved. 
 Uh, Valerie Edwards, Global Affairs. 
 Why on earth would SRI do that? 
 We've seen no intelligence linking losava's network to Romania. 
 We have. 
 Apparently, SRI have had their eyes on him for some time. 
 Iosava has heavy involvement in the black market in Bucharest. 
 Okay, regardless, I need proof of life if this negotiation's gonna go forward. 
 We've already reached out to the Romanians. 
 Oh, come on. That's it? 
 You reached out? That... That's all you got? 
 And you are? 
 Robert Kirsch, Deputy Chief. 
 Robert, you know as much as I do now. 
 Clay, she's 28 years old. 
 This is her first tour. We really need her back, okay? 
 Then let's get on it. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 f*ck! 
 75 minutes till Ruth losava calls, and we got jack sh1t! 
 Light a fire under Johnson. 
 Just... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Johnson. 
 Tell me you have good news. We've tracked her log-in session through a global proxy chain of six hubs, but we've hit one that I think is under the control of Chinese Third Department. 
 We're unlikely to crack it anytime soon, but we're trying. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 [ Sighs ] You wouldn't happen to have any of those, um... 
 Oh, thank you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I know it's my Western privilege talking, but... 
 I fail to see how someone can go from that to someone who's willing to kill and be killed for an archaic, misogynistic death cult like ISIL. 
 [ Sighs ] Fell for the wrong guy, I guess. 
 Right. Because women can't fall for bad ideology, only bad men. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Why don't you go home, get some sleep? 
 I'm going for a food run. 
 Is kebab okay? 
 It's the only thing that's open. 
 [ Scoffing ] Yeah, kebab. That's perfect. 
 [ Siren wails in distance ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Hans? 
 [ Cellphone buzzing ] 
 [ Beep ] Yeah? 
 Frost : Um, I'm sorry I haven't called, Hans, but I've been dealing with Washington. 
 Hans : About what happened at the mall or what happened to Aleksandre losava? 
 I'm going to ask you this once as a friend. 
 You don't even have to ask the question, Hans. 
 Because in what world does it make sense that I would risk the life of one of my officers to take losava? 
 Your masters have wanted to all along. 
 Tell me, Steven, did Langley finally get its way? 
 They would never do that in the middle of an operation. 
 Look, Hans, um... 
 Does your team have any leads as to where Ruth might have taken my officer? 
 Not yet. And now I must meet with Chancellor Merkel to convince her the gunmen who shot up a mall aren't linked to the refugees. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Camera shutters clicking ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Speaks German ] 
 Uh-huh. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 If there was a clue left behind, don't you think it would be with the police in an evidence bag? 
 Hector : Theoretically speaking, yes. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 What? 
 "I do." She left a message. 
 [ Scoffs ] What, a marriage proposal? 
 No, no, no, no. She... She borrowed a-a ring from me this morning, said she needed it for cover. 
 Wait a second. 
 What? 
 Wedding. 
 That's what I'm saying. 
 No. 
 No, the neighborhood. 
 "Vedding." 
 Maybe that's the message. 
 Oh, Clare, you genius. 
 And you, Daniel Miller, well done. 
 [ Telephone ringing ] 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, put him through. 
 Valerie? I got someone here who wants to talk to you. 
 Hey. 
 Hector, where are you? 
 At a roadblock. 
 At least the Germans know a manhunt is in order. 
 You're going after her? 
 And if I was? 
 Officially, I'd have to tell you to stop, insist you come back to the embassy. 
 Yeah, well, Frost sent me home, so scratch that option. 
 Unofficially. 
 Hold on a sec. 
 Auf wiedersehen. 
 [ Shouts in German ] 
 Answer me this, Val. 
 What would Clare have us do... Sit back and negotiate, or turn over every stone until we found her? 
 Both. 
 Fair enough. 
 So will you help me? 
 I'm listening. 
 She left a message in the van. 
 We're heading to Wedding. 
 I'll make some inquiries, yeah. 
 Can you give me access to Brown Bear? 
 It's Clare, Val. It's all or nothing. 
 Meet me there in an hour. 
 Brown Bear? 
 Means she has my back. 
 And yours. 
 Hector : I need smokes. 
 Sandra, it's Daniel. Do you have Steven? 
 Daniel on line one. 
 [ Door shuts ] 
 [ Phone beeps ] 
 [ Sighs ] How's he doing? 
 What if I told you we were onto something? 
 What do you mean you're onto something? 
 You're supposed to be locking him down. 
 Events took a turn. 
 I'm not getting any younger here, Daniel. Come on. 
 We searched the van. 
 Wait, you broke into a f*cking impound lot? 
 Listen, Clare left a message that seems to indicate they're holding her in Wedding. 
 Jesus. 
 Where in Wedding? 
 That's all we have right now. 
 Yeah. Okay, well... 
 Come back here for a debrief, and I'll get a team on it. 
 No, you already have a team on it. 
 No, no. No. He's a mess. 
 He's too close to this. No. 
 We don't have time for all that. 
 I got to go. 
 Da... [ Sighs ] 
 [ Train clicking ] 
 Jesus. 
 What are these, street-cam photos? 
 You guys hacking the German database willy-nilly now? 
 I told Hans Richter that Israel has had its own eye on losava and is just as fed up with CIA entitlement issues as he is. 
 And he just handed you these? 
 He has a fondness for me. 
 The guy is gayer than a picnic basket. 
 You know that, right? 
 [ Chuckles ] Not in the '80s. 
 I don't want to know. 
 Thank you, Golda. 
 I need you to bring me something in return. 
 I need the file from December 7, 2010, code name "Antoinette." 
 You kidding me? A woman's life is on the line, you're asking me to steal you a f*cking file? 
 Bring it to me before noon today. 
 f*ck that! No way. We're in the middle of a crisis here! 
 Jesus! 
 Which just got better, thanks to us. 
 Besides, a crisis means distraction. 
 "Antoinette," Robert. 
 Tel Aviv is counting on you.

 Now, was I attempting in a more legal means to have him arrested? Yeah, I was. 
 But somebody did take him, and I've been doing everything I can in my power to get him back.

 Now, if... if I had him here in Berlin under my watch, I'd make the exchange myself. But I don't. I don't. 
 But those who do have him aren't acting in my interests any more than yours.

 "They"? 
 Ah, she speaks. 
 Just answer me this. 
 Are you even a Muslim, or was that, too, part of the act? 
 I am. 
 I believe you, and yet I find myself even more disappointed than if you were a kafir. 
 Why is that? 
 They can be tolerated in their ignorance. But you? 
 You reject the Prophet and still call yourself a believer? 
 I happen not to see it that way. 
 Of course not. 
 You see it whichever way suits you best, whichever path is most convenient. 
 The drive-thru mentality of the West. 
 Everything easy, within arm's reach. 
 And instead of rejecting that, you embrace this disposable God. 
 That was my error. 
 I do not speak from judgment but experience. 
 I was like you once. 
 Then you saw the light? 
 And you thought, "Allah wants us to suffer"? 
 You are already suffering, my dear. 
 The system you live in is sick. 
 Why do you think more and more girls come to me, wanting to join the caliphate? 
 Because they're young and impressionable. 
 Because they have rejected the West's attempts to brainwash them into a life of endless consumerism.

 [ Scoffs ] 
 Aleksandre... 
 But maybe they lied. 
 No. No. 
 No. 
 They lied to us. 
 No, no. 
 It's not true. It's not true, Frau losava. 
 Cut the feed. 
 Cut the damn feed! 
 [ Computer beeps ] 
 Listen to me. Do not do thi... 
 There's a way out of this. 
 We had a deal, Steven. 
 Oh, no. 
 Now we don't! 
 There was never going to be an exchange. 
 You know it as well as I do. 
 [ Speaking Arabic ] Aleksandre losava for this disposable thing, this hypocrite! 
 There is no God but God. 
 Shut up! 
 All of you. 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 Listen, there's still a way out of here. 
 There is a way... 
 No, there isn't. 
 There's a way out, but if you pull the trigger... 
 [ Gunshots ] 
 [ Shell casings clink ] 
 Let her go. 
 Daniel : There's SWAT team outside. There's no officers. 
 It's just me and him. 
 If you put the gun down... and let her go... you can still get out of here alive. 
 I love you, Clare. I love you. 
 My freedom comes from you people? I don't think so. 
 Just shoot this c**t already, will you? 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 Oh, f*ck! Down! 
 On the f*cking floor! 
 Get down! 
 Jesus. 
 [ Gasping ] 
 Clare, no, no, no, no, no. No. 
 No, baby. No, baby. 
 Hector. 
 Shh. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 No, no, no. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 [ Sighs tearfully ] 
 What are you doing? 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 You sure you picked the right celestial pony, lady? 
 I sure as hell wouldn't bet on paradise right now if I were you. 
 Hector. 
 Hector, you're better than this. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 No, I'm not. 
 I'm the worst this fucked-up agency has to offer. 
 [ Bones snap ] 
 [ Gasps ] 
 [ Breathes heavily ] 
 [ Cellphone buzzing ] 
 Yes? 
 Valerie? It's Daniel. 
 Where are you? 
 We're in the warehouse. 
 What happened? 
 Ruth got away. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Where's Clare? 
 Valerie... I am so sorry. 
 Listen, we need an anonymous tip called in so that Clare can be found. 
 If word gets out that Hector and I were here, we'll be on the next plane back to headquarters before Clare's in the ground. 
 I'll have it arranged. 
 [ Cellphone clicks ] 
 [ Siren wails in distance ] 
 Steven, Hans is on line two. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Excuse me, please. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 Hans. 
 I'll keep this brief. 
 I know the Americans renditioned losava. 
 For the sake of your family, if not our friendship, I'm warning you to brace yourself for the consequences. 
 Hans, wait. Langley's not playing straight with me. 
 The story is breaking now. 
 Did... 
 [  News theme music plays  ] 
 News anchor :  No rest for the infamous Thomas Shaw this evening, and no mercy for the CIA. 
 A new leak has named Steven Frost as chief of the CIA station in Berlin and the man behind the illegal rendition of Aleksandre losava. 
 Iosava, a German citizen and alleged Georgian terrorist was plucked off the streets of the German capital last night. 
 If there's one secret that does seem to be able to remain safe these days, it is the identity of Thomas Shaw. 
 For more on this breaking news, let's cut to a press conference. Here's a statement made by Krischan Ganz, head of German Intelligence, just a few minutes ago in Cologne. [ Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' "The Mercy Seat" playing ] Hector : You and me joined at the hip again... That's either fate or a cosmically bad idea. With you, Hector, it's one and the same thing. Daniel : Where'd they post you after Chechnya? Hell. They sent me to hell. Hurt a man the first time, and you feel it. You hurt a man a second time, and you excuse it. And then you justify it, and then you exploit it. ♪ And I think my head is burning ♪ 
♪ And in a way, I'm yearning to be done ♪ Daniel, you're a company man. There's no harm in that. So was I once. But tonight, you're in bad company. I'm the worst this fucked-up agency has to offer. ♪♪♪♪
