 Previously on "Berlin Station"... 
 You're Thomas Shaw. 
 I know about De Vos, the black site, the murder of Claudia Gartner, Ingrid Hollander, all of it. 
 You can take your mind games to the Germans. 
 You don't wanna do that, Sherlock. 
 The Germans got to me before you did. 
 You're free to go back to whatever agenda you choose after Berlin Station is sufficiently crippled. 
 I'll turn myself in before I give you Shaw. 
 And what about Julian De Vos? 
 I'm sure the boys in maximum security would love to dress him up as Shirley Pimple. 
 I told you. 
 Yeah. 
 I've been thinking of ways of changing the system. 
 It would involve me taking on a new identity. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Just... just get on that f*cking boat and go. 
 Steven : Frank Dupont, former Special Activities. 
 You were contracted to kill Julian De Vos? 
 I shot him, sure. 
 Unless you got eyes on a body yourself, never count 'em for dead. 
 Robert : Clay Williams is here. 
 Just when you thought things shouldn't get any worse. 
 I need to close out the Iosava case. 
 The Germans think that I took Iosava. 
 So what exactly are you doing here? 
 Hans didn't mention he arrested Zoltan Vasile, the thug that took Iosava? 
 No. 
 Give this to Sandra. 
 Steven! 
 [Cell door closes] 
 You'll be happy to know that I've dug up something deeper than dirt on Ms. Edwards. 
 Valerie : An unscheduled meeting with Golda Friedman. 
 Are you a double agent for Mossad? 
 I don't work for Golda. They work for me. 
 Then prove it. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Uhh! Aah! 
 Come on. 
 Daniel : There weren't better ways to make amends than Thomas Shaw? 
 Hector : Not from my vantage point. 
 Danny? 
 You touch my cousin, and I will kill you. 
 Julian, just tell me where you are. 
 Teufelsberg. 
 [Electricity crackles, tires peal] 
 I accept the fact that I choose to work for an imperfect institution, like a big boy. 
 You want sprinkles on that vanilla cone, big boy? 
 You should have just come with me when you let me go. 
 No. 
 [Gasps] 
 Daniel : Go on, as far and as fast as you can. 
 There's a picture on my desk. 
 Maybe you should look at it, Daniel. 
 You run, too. 
 They'll be here soon enough.

 My name is Thomas Shaw, and this is my final message. From the start, I have tried to make the Central Intelligence Agency accountable for its actions. I have not always succeeded, but I have tried. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Birds chirping] Patricia: Why did you let him go? 
 Hector's not free. He never will be. 
 It all makes sense now, the way you never tell me anything... your sudden vanishing acts. 
 You became your father. 
 Cold, absent. 
 Was he that way because of his job, or did he choose to become a spy because it was perfect for him? 
 What about you? 
 It's the only thing I was ever any good at. 
 [Line rings] 
 Emergency situation. 
 Marjorie Dennis Toledo. 
 I need to be brought in, someplace off the books. 
 I have a civilian with me. 
 [Line rings, line connects] 
 Did I wake you? 
 I never sleep, Robert. You know that. 
 I need your file on Aleksandre Iosava. 
 Iosava? Still? 
 What is it with that little man? 
 Clay Williams has been busy boxing up all the Iosava intercepts, and the digital versions have mysteriously been erased. 
 Nothing Clay Williams has done is kosher. I suspect a cover-up. 
 What are they covering up? 
 I won't know until I can compare our intercepts with your file. 
 Then let's trade. 
 No, there's no time. 
 If my suspicions are right, then I can get leverage over Clay and salvage my career. 
 With all these Berlin fuck-ups in my corridor file, I'll... I'll top out at GS-15, 
 I'll never get my SES. You wanna try selling a washed-up instructor to Tel Aviv? 
 Bring me your intercepts, and we compare them to our files. 
 No, no, no, no. Berlin was the sole recipient. Only the Station's hard copies exist,  and they're being watched over by a Headquarters stiff. 
 I need to take your file to the Station. 
 Okay, um, how about this? 
 Our January summary just crossed my desk. 
 You want it? 
 Get me the Chief of Station Overview. 
 I can't do that. 
 I give you everything, Robert... the Iranian Behruz, Iosava surveillance, a path to promotion. I support you. 
 It's time for you  to start supporting us. Tomorrow afternoon, location Hosea. 
 You bring the Overview, I will bring the Iosava files. 
 Unbelievable. 
 I accuse you of selling out to Mossad, and this is how you answer my accusations? 
 [Tablet clinks] 
 There is no answer, Valerie, and you know it. 
 [Wrapper clatters] 
 The only thing I can do is my job. 
 I'm using my liaison contact to compare our transcripts to Mossad's. 
 She wants the Chief of Station Overview. 
 You are  not  giving Mossad the true names of our agents. 
 Okay. [Sighs] 
 All right. 
 Well, let's just pack up and go home. 
 Call it a day, why don't we? 
 Getting clarity on Iosava is the only way to figure out what Clay Williams is up to. 
 It may shed light on what happened to Clare. 
 Hell, if we're lucky, we might even save Steven in the process. 
 Am... am I missing something? 
 Yeah, life in prison for treason. 
 There's one way we're gonna handle this, and you're gonna do exactly what I say. 
 Is that understood? 
 [Cell door unlocks] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door clanks, locks] 
 They're treating you well? 
 It's been a while since I've spent this much time alone. 
 So, I, uh... had time to think about some things. 
 [Sighs] 
 Like... 
 Why didn't Daniel Miller turn Shaw over to you, when he knew my freedom depended on it? 
 And you. You could've quietly let me leave the country. 
 I would've done it for you. 
 There wasn't time, Steven. 
 You convinced me to push a joint operation that ended in bloodshed. 
 It may be noble in America, but not here. 
 Oh, well... Oh, how does a German court produce an arrest warrant that fast? 
 Nobody is that good at their job. 
 We're known for our efficiency. 
 Then I started to think about Thomas Shaw. 
 And for months, he would randomly hit station after station all over the world. 
 Then all of a sudden, he decides he's gotta focus entirely on  my  station. 
 Thomas Shaw works for you. 
 ♪♪ 
 Just tell me where he is. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 So you can clean up the last of the evidence, find Shaw, and then kill him? 
 [Hands slap sides] 
 Do your colleagues... do they even know about this, Hans? 
 Do they? 
 No. 
 It's just you. 
 Maybe Esther Krug? 
 Why? 
 What... Why would you want to kill my station? 
 What, I-I-I didn't... 
 You have to  ask,  Steven? 
 After you've listened to all of Germany's telephone calls and read all our mail? 
 After you have dragged us into a war on terror that  you  started? You think that with the Marshall Plan, you bought this continent? You did not. You did not. 
 That's politics! Don't hide behind that. 
 You f*cked me over for months...  months ... while you smiled in my face. 
 I wake each morning feeling breath on the back of my neck. 
 You feel it, too. 
 No, I don't. 
 You know, the only thing that I really feel is stupid because I actually thought that you were my friend. 
 [Hand slaps side] 
 The things we do to hold on to our position. 
 We move too fast. We sacrifice our friends. 
 We push ill-advised operations in shopping malls. 
 Let's stop lying to each other, Steven. 
 Everything we do is to delay the inevitable. 
 Tomorrow, we both lose. 
 Today, I win. 
 [Sighs] 
 See, you have no idea where Hector is. 
 You haven't won a thing, Hans. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Cell door unlocks] 
 [Cell door closes] 
 [Keys clank] 
 Thank you. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Typing] 
 [Line rings] 
 [Beep] 
 Hey, it's DeJean. I need to fly the unfriendly skies. [Birds chirping] So this is where you all hide. [Horn honks in distance] When they come, what's gonna happen? They will get us out of the country. This is my home, Daniel. This is Max's home. I know. But even if the BFV didn't follow me to you, they still know you're my cousin and they will find you. ♪♪ Still here. Robert needs me to get into one of my agent files. Russian code clerk. Time-sensitive. She'll be gone tomorrow. Better be. [Telephone ringing in distance] [Lowered voice] I can't believe I'm letting you f*cking do this. [Whispers] It's your plan. You wanna do it? No, this is your mess. I'm not going to prison. [Keypad beeping] [Safe door opens] Got it. [Sighs] [Whispers] This is so f*cked up. [Whispers] Just make the copies. Come on. Hi there. I work with Daniel. What's your name? This way. [Doors close] You're Clay Williams, counterterrorism. And you're Daniel Miller. Come on. Give me some good news. Tell me how your mission's going. Thomas Shaw. What are you talking about? Jemma Moore and I put together a lot of harebrained schemes to try to being Shaw down, but when she told me about a case officer-turned-analyst in Panama who wanted to go it alone, I said she was crazy. Was she? Look... I don't know who Shaw is, but I do know the Germans are running him. Hans Richter's afraid that I'll make this public. He just tried to kill me. f*ck me. The BFV is targeting an American diplomat in the middle of Berlin? They've gone completely off the rails. I'm pretty sure that he's outsourcing it to some criminal gangs. From where I'm standing, it makes no difference. She and I need to be exfilled. She won't leave without her son. He's in Munich. I'll arrange for both of you and the kid to go stateside. Just like that. Welcome to the seventh floor. ♪♪ Have you heard anything? The Germans are barely speaking to us. [Whispers] Oh, God. But they know better than to mistreat Steven. He gave me this for you. [Sniffles] Do you mind taking a drive? No. Sure. [Car alarm chirps] This is a file on Zoltan Vasile, the Romanian who kidnapped Aleksandre Iosava, the man the Germans think that Steven hired. Well, did he? No, Kelly, he didn't. Well, I wouldn't know, would I? He didn't. Yeah, well... guess you do know him better than I do. [Sighs] So what do we do now? We see if we can't find Zoltan Vasile. [Birds chirping] There was a moment I thought you were not going to show up. [Groans] You make me sad, Golda. In 1983, I was running a Lebanese agent. He was with me for over a year before I brought him to meet my chief. At this meeting, the moment he shook my chief's hand, he blew himself up. I barely survived. My chief did not. You, Robert, have only been with me for a month. Well, I hope I live long enough to have as many fun stories as you. I don't know why you're so interested in the Iosavas. There was never anything to them, other than child brides in the desert. What are you talking about? Why are you telling me this now? If Steven Frost wants to make a fool of himself, why should Mossad stand in the way? Robert Samuel Kirsch, Federal Bureau of Investigation. We're taking you into custody for espionage. [Under breath] Oh, f*ck. Okay, okay. You f*cking kidding me? Let's go. We will look out for you. Thanks, Golda, but I think I'm f*cked. She buy it? No way to tell with her. Can you get these f*cking things off of me, please? ♪♪ It's good to finally meet you, Mr. Richter. Mr. Williams. [Chair clatters on floor] I hope you haven't come all this way to demand Steven Frost's release. No, no, I wouldn't presume to. That's a man who's made some poor decisions, and he needs to face the consequences. So you are saying, officially, that Steven Frost authorized the rendition of Aleksandre Iosava? [Chuckles] Um, well, I'm not saying anything officially. There's a reason we are meeting here. It's clean. No one can hear us. [Piano playing lightly] You're running Thomas Shaw. And in order to keep that a secret, you've been trying to kill Daniel Miller. Who the f*ck does that? Huh? Now you give me Shaw, and we'll straighten this mess out. You, on the other hand, are trying to frame Steven Frost for the Iosava rendition, when we both know he didn't order it. You have Zoltan Vasile in custody? Come on. Huh? He's in prison, under the protection of the Prosecutor's Office. Okay. Let's do a little free trade here, Hans. You take care of Zoltan Vasile. I'll take care of Daniel Miller. Surely you're not that indifferent to your own people? [Scoffs] Hans, how the hell did you survive the Cold War? What we do, we do for our countries. That's a given. And sometimes that means we're the janitors. We have to get a big mop and clean everything up. If it ever came out that you were running Shaw, more than your career would go down the toilet. I'm throwing you a lifeline. ♪♪ 
 
 [Birds chirping] [Bell tolling in distance] Shouldn't they have been here by now? There's a lot to arrange. I doubt we're their top priority. That's them? sh1t. [Blinds clink] We need to go. ♪♪ [Cellphone rings] Hello? Wherever you are, get out now. You're too late. Are you... You were running him. You and Hans, you were running Hector. Now you're trying to kill us. No! I... [Line disconnects] [Birds chirping] [Doorbell rings] Johnson, it's Daniel. Listen, I have a strange request, but it's important. It's in Hector's desk. ♪♪ Headquarters fed us a line from day one. It's clear in every goddamn transcript. The Iosavas may have been a nasty pair of matchmakers, but they were never grade "A" terrorists. Or you were fishing for a cover story. Okay. Look, we're in this together, like it or not. All right? So soon as Johnson collects our intercepts from the SCIF, we'll take everything we've got here down to the Station and have a proper reckoning. [Door creaks] [Door closes] [Floorboard creaks] [Loud clatter] [Paper rattling] [Ring] Yeah? Thank you, Johnson. All the Iosava intercepts... shredded. [Cellphone thuds] [Sighs] Now  do you believe me? You know what? Let's knock off, get a few hours of sleep, wake up to another f*cked up day tomorrow. Whoa. You think you're sleeping here tonight? I know you don't like me, Valerie, but do you really want a Mossad bullet in the back of my head? I don't know. How long do I get to decide? Why did Langley do this? That's what we're gonna find out. [Airplane engines whirring] I'll tell you, I was surprised when our Air Force attaché told me he'd just received a landing clearance request for the Director's plane. I don't have a lot of time, Franzen. I have a letter for the Ambassador. It's from the White House. I'll deliver it. No, I will deliver it. You don't need to copy Headquarters about our arrival. I will do that. James here will draft a message for your commo to send. Let's go. [Sighs] You're alive. Barely. Probably not smart to be here. Probably not. Clay Williams... he's trying to kill you. He made a deal with Hans. [Exhales] Why did you call to warn me? I'd be one less person that knew you and Hans were running Thomas Shaw. My death makes you safer. Yeah. Probably does. Germany's interests are more important than your feelings. Didn't you tell me that? Of course I did. And they are. We almost had something, didn't we? [Whispers] Yes. [Breathing heavily] Where did Hector keep the files that he copied from the Station? Hmm? [Gasps] He would have kept a cache. We never found it. ♪♪ [Door unlocks] Ms. Mason, yes? I'm afraid I have difficult news concerning Mr. Vasile. Well, my old cover worked, but that's the only good news. Zoltan Vasile is dead. They told me he hung himself. Do you believe it? No. Todd, I want to introduce Michael Scheel from the Director's Office. Michael, good to meet you. It's been a long flight, sir. If I may... [Papers rustle] White House, huh? [Clears throat] [Sighs] And to be handled in CIA channels only? There's a cable on its way to you, sir. It says I can't even call back on my secure terminal. I don't think the President wants the NSA listening in on this one. Well, you, uh, you wanna tell me what this one is? [Door closes] I'm gonna need this cable sent off, stat. Of course, sir. [Typing] This guy's been linked to Paris, Brussels. And last week, his name came up in an interrogation about an imminent terror attack on Manhattan. The Saudis, as usual, don't know what they have. But I've got a ticking clock and a chair for him at a black site in Morocco. I just need to sit him in it. What are the Saudis holding him for? Sodomy. Sodomy? [Sighs deeply] Like I said, they don't know what they've got. And given that he worked for Saudi Intelligence in Berlin, I think it's best we don't tell 'em. [Door closes] Now I've got the CIA Director chiming in with the White House. How dangerous is this guy? You okay? [Voice breaks] How did this all happen? What? All of it. I thought the Iosavas, um, I thought it was important. I thought it was crucial. People died, Robert. Clare died in a f*cking warehouse. [Sniffles] Don't tell anybody I cried. I will kill you myself. [Sniffles] I don't know why I'm trusting you. I don't know if you're telling me the truth. Here's the truth. Golda knew I was pissed at Steven after the Iran conference. She thought she saw an opening there to turn me. I played along, figuring... eventually, I could feed Mossad whatever we wanted. Headquarters approved. I guess we never got to "eventually." What will you do? Move in with you, clearly. [Chuckles] [Knock on door] Hey. Hi. Hi. Why would the Germans want to kill the man who kidnapped Aleksandre Iosava? Because Zoltan Vasile's confession wouldn't have led to Steven. But that's the question. Why does Hans Richter want Steven to go down for the rendition? And why would headquarters lie to us about the Iosavas? Can you take a message to Steven? Yes, of course. [Cellphone rings] [Ring] Hello? Daniel. Where are you? Is this where you've been hiding out? Where's Hector? I need your help. [Door opens] [Window whirs] Hans : In two days, he'll meet with the prosecutor and be able to prove his innocence. Good. When are you seeing the prosecutor? Don't say I never did you a favor, Steven. [Door closes, locks] Steven :  How are you? Absolutely wonderful. I didn't go see Sandra. And... I did not give her your gift. Oh. Oh. [Sighs] He's alive and well. Good. Good. The Iosavas... All the information you got from Headquarters was completely true. Clay Williams is not covering anything up. [Door opens] I'm afraid our time is up. [Whispers indistinctly] [Inhales deeply] [Whispers indistinctly] [Footsteps depart] [Door closes] [Exhales deeply] I'm in hiding... from Clay Williams. Clay Williams shredded the Iosava intercepts. Most of which were lies. Headquarters was pushing their own agenda with the Iosavas, and now they're trying to cover it up, framing Frost for the rendition. What about Zoltan Vasile? Zoltan Vasile mysteriously hung himself in a German prison. sh1t. Hans killed Zoltan Vasile for Clay. In exchange, Clay was gonna kill me for Hans. Wait. What are you talking about? Is that why Clay's in Berlin? No, he's not here for me. [Whispers] He's here for Thomas Shaw. That's it. [Normal voice] Clay drummed up an obsession with the Iosavas to try and flush Shaw out into the open. Distribute false intercepts to a small circle of people and watch to see who leaks them. An eyewash. But the fake intercepts were so good that somebody at the Agency believed them. Decided to kidnap Iosava... One hand didn't know what the other was doing. [Cellphone rings] And Steven's paying for it. Yeah? He says it's an eyewash. [Door closes] Steven agrees. I got what you asked for from Hector's desk. Thank you. What's this? What are you doing? We can prove the eyewash if we can find copies of the original intercepts. Copies? Yeah. Thomas Shaw made copies. How do you know that, Daniel? Because I know who he is. Hector is Thomas Shaw. Hector? [Whispers] No. Valerie... Okay. So if Hector is Thomas Shaw, then who the f*ck are you? I was sent here to find him. I'm the one who turned the spotlight on Berlin. I opened the door to all of this. And we need to close it once and for all. No. [Beep] Golda. Hans. I have information. My people spotted some Americans of interest at the Kollhoff Tower. Robert Kirsch, Daniel Miller, and Valerie Edwards is already inside. What are they doing? They are debriefing a mole they have been running inside the Reichstag. Why are you telling me this? Because I always pay people back. [Click] [Beep] [Door opens] [Door closes] _ [Door opens] [Door closes] [Beep] [Speaks German] Welcome to Europe's fastest elevator. In only 20 seconds, we'll be already at 90 meters high. At a speed of 8.5 meters per second, 30 kilometers per hour, and we're already there. [Elevator bell dings] [Elevator door closes] [Indistinct conversations] Clear so far. [Brakes squeal] Four coming in, Robert. Got it. Thanks. [Elevator bell dings] [Speaks German] Valerie Edwards! Okay. Okay. Hey! Oh! I'm an American diplomat. We got company. I swear to God, if this doesn't work out, I'll f*cking kill Hector. And if it does? I'll f*cking kill him anyway. [Grunts] [Grunts] Uhh! Uhh! [Fire alarm ringing] [Grunts] I got it. [Alarm continues ringing] Get the f*ck out of here. Go. Hey, guys. What's going on? Robert Kirsch? Yeah, that's who I am. Why? What do you need? Hey. Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Take it easy. Where's she going? [Alarm continues ringing] ♪♪ [Silenced gunshot] [Grunts] [Woman screams] [Grunts, groans] What do you got? Where is it Daniel? Where is it? Huh? Where is it? You son of a bitch. [Grunts] ♪♪ Daniel's voice :  My name is Thomas Shaw, and this is my final message. From the start, I have tried to make the Central Intelligence Agency accountable for its actions. I have not always succeeded... But I have tried. And along the way... I ruined the lives of many people. Now I need to be accountable for my own actions. [Silenced gunshot] The CIA's hunt for Thomas Shaw, through what it calls an "eyewash," has resulted in too many deaths, too much destruction. To what end? They still don't know who I am, and they will never know. All that's left of their deceit... are broken bodies and broken lives. It would be irresponsible to continue on my path. It would make me no better than they are. And so... goodbye. Some will ask who Thomas Shaw was. A man. A woman. A collective. In Berlin, people on the street say, "I am Shaw"... men, women, children. The fact is, we're all complicit. We all know something is wrong. We've known it for a long time. But we do nothing. Exposing wrongs is not the same as righting them. Governments are not moved by shame. Actually changing things with your own hands? That's the hard part. If Thomas Shaw represents change, then show me the change, and then I'll say that I was him. Until then... we could be anybody. [David Bowie's "Memory of a Free Festival" playing] ♪ The Sun Machine is coming down ♪
