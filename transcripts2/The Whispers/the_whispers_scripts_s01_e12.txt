 When the blazing sun is gone. 
 When he nothing shines upon. 
 When he nothing shines upon. 
 Then you shine your little light. 
 Twinkle, twinkle in the night. 
 Then the traveler in the dark... thanks you for your little spark. 
 He could not see which way to go... 
 If you did not twinkle so. 
 I am telling you, there is no way that Minx would have let this happen, sir. 
 Wes, over 50 people saw her burn the president's daughter. 
 I'm very... I'm very aware of the situation. 
 It's the same burn mark that was found on Dr. Benavidez, Thomas Harcourt. 
 [Sighs] 
 How do you explain that? 
 I don't know, but I... I know there's another explanation for this. 
 Yeah, one of these kids is inhabited... not my daughter! 
 Let me talk to her. I'll... 
 Do you really think you're an impartial judge? 
 Claire. 
 Please. Please. 
 Wes, I can't. 
 I can't do... I can't be the one. 
 Okay, just... just go... just go and ask her what really happened, okay? 
 Please. 
 You're the only one I trust. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 You can leave. 
 [Sighs] 
 Minx, I need to talk to you. 
 If I can understand what happened out there, what happened to Cassandra, I can help you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You want me to prove I'm not Drill. 
 Can you? 
 Well, if I was Drill, wouldn't I want to trick you into thinking I'm not? 
 So... [Sighs] no matter what I do... 
 Besides... [Scoffs] why do I have to prove it? 
 Shouldn't you have to prove I'm guilty? 
 Why don't we try something? 
 I'm gonna take your gloves off. 
 You want me to touch you? 
 Like you did Cassandra, yes. 
 But... 
 Aren't you scared? 
 I'm trying not to be. 
 I don't want to do this. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. One more thing. 
 [Sighs] 
 Can you tell me what Orion is? 
 I don't know... you say you want to help me, but you keep asking me questions. 
 I do want to help you. 
 I do want to help you, Minx. 
 [Sighs] No, I don't believe you. 
 Why would you say that? 
 'Cause you don't like me. 
 No, that is... that's not true. 
 You want me to be guilty. 
 No. 
 You want me to be Drill. [Scoffs] 
 'Cause then you get everything... 
 Don't you? 
 All I want right now... is to find Drill. 
 Do you really think it's gonna be that easy? 
 So, Dr. Benavidez told you about Drill? 
 Not exactly. 
 See, she was frightened... couldn't give me the full story. 
 That's how it usually works with whistle-blowers. 
 They give you a bread crumb and hope you find the truth and leave them out of it. 
 What's the bread crumb? 
 Harbor Point. 
 She told me to dig into the real story. 
 That's when I learned about the meltdown, what happened afterwards, and how Drill was responsible. 
 So you know what Drill is. 
 As far as I can tell, it's a secret government nuclear-testing program. 
 Now, whether Drill is an acronym or a code name... 
 I'm still working on that one. 
 But that night, at Harbor Point, something went wrong, and children in the surrounding area started getting sick, including your son. 
 So in order to contain the situation and keep the truth from getting out, our government issued a round-up. 
 Now 87 children are locked up with no hope of ever getting out. 
 I just need confirmation. 
 I think we're done here. 
 Just give me something. 
 The public, they have a right to know what's really happening. 
 [Sighs] 
 You think you're gonna be able to hide this much longer? 
 Other news outlets, they're already chasing the story. 
 Please. 
 [Sighs] 
 Wait. 
 He's right. 
 It's just a matter of time. 
 How about we make a deal? 
 You help me get what I want, I'll give you the biggest story of your life. 
 Henry. 
 I need to ask you something. 
 It's about Minx, isn't it? 
 You were right there. 
 You saw what happened. 
 I don't want to get Minx in trouble. 
 Neither do I. 
 But right now, we really need to know the truth. 
 She... 
 She grabbed Cassandra. 
 And you're sure about this? 
 'Cause, Henry, I need you to be 100% sure that it was Minx. 
 Silas, walk us through that night... the night that you saw Dr. Benavidez get killed. 
 Can you do that? 
 Okay. 
 What were you doing out here so late at night? 
 I had to go to the bathroom... but I got lost. 
 There was a light from one of the offices. 
 She was talking on the phone... the doctor. 
 What was she saying? Do you remember? 
 I don't remember the words, but she sounded worried. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 She saw something bad on the computer, I think. 
 Then what happened? 
 There was a sound. It came from there. 
 Someone was there, but I couldn't see who. 
 So the doctor, I think she saw who was there, who was at the door, and... 
 Silas, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 There was this funny noise, like... A zap. 
 No. No. 
 Stay away! 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 The doctor... she fell down. 
 She stopped moving. 
 And you saw who it was, didn't you? 
 She didn't see me at first. 
 I tried to get away. 
 [Thud] Then she saw me. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 She said she was going to kill my mom. 
 [Crying] 
 She said if I told anyone... 
 Is my mom okay? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 She's okay. 
 I need to know if you're sure... 
 It was Minx that you saw. 
 It was her. I swear. 
 We have something. 
 We were able to recover partial fragments of Dr. Benavidez's hard drive. 
 Here's the activity log from that night. 
 At 11:06 P.M., she made an entry into a notes field. 
 At the same time, she was talking to an unidentified number. 
 No trace yet of who she was talking to? 
 Not yet, sir. 
 But at 11:09 P.M., her call was disconnected. 
 The next activity... 12:28 A.M. 
 That's after her time of death. 
 Someone accessed that same file, somehow bypassing her security password. 
 They then erased the last note that was made. 
 Any way to recover the note? 
 Unfortunately not. 
 But I was able to determine which file was modified. 
 Millicent? 
 That's Minx's real name. 
 Drill was covering his tracks. 
 The doctor must have found some kind of evidence that proved Minx is Drill. 
 That'll be all for now. 
 I believe I have what I need now. 
 But since Wes has asked for your input, Agent Bennigan... 
 What's your professional opinion? 
 Wes... 
 It isn't just the burn mark. 
 Silas... he knew details that he could have only known if he was actually there, and you heard his voice... a child his age can't fake that kind of fear. 
 Okay, so he saw something... 
 We both know that witnesses... and Minx's file, if something was erased... 
 We don't know... We don't know what was in that file, Claire. 
 All I can do... is look at this like you and I have been trained to do. 
 I wish... I wish... more than anything that I could conclude something else. 
 Claire. Claire. Claire. 
 Please. 
 Please. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Sniffles] Okay. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Clang] 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 Thank you, Agent Bennigan. 
 [Water running] 
 [Metal clangs] 
 Jessup : What are you doing? 
 Jessup, he's right. 
 The truth is gonna come out... maybe not today, but soon. 
 Let's make this work for us. 
 Us? 
 And how exactly does that work? 
 Reporters have to fact-check, right? 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning I tell him everything that's really going on with the kids, with Drill. 
 His first call's gonna be to the White House for confirmation. 
 After that... 
 Pressure's on. 
 They're gonna have to release the kids, or they're gonna have to deal with the backlash of the public. 
 You mean panic. 
 'Cause that's what we're talking about here. 
 It's only a matter of time. 
 Time is something that I do not have. 
 I want my son home now. 
 I want those removed. 
 I'm sorry, sir. I have my orders. 
 This is ridiculous! She is a child! 
 Come on. 
 Sir! Sir! 
 Minx : No, stop! 
 I'll have no choice but to escort you out. 
 Do you understand? 
 Yes. 
 10 minutes. 
 That's what you've been cleared for. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You okay, sweetie? 
 [Whimpering] 
 You have to get me out, daddy. 
 Honey, I just need a little more time, okay? 
 How much time? 
 All right? 
 I know they're gonna do something to me. 
 Sweetie, I will not let them hurt you. 
 I promise, okay? 
 All right? 
 I'm scared. 
 I know. 
 But you and I... we just need to be brave right now, okay? 
 [Crying] 
 Okay, baby. It's all right. 
 [Smooches] 
 Alright? 
 Hey. I understand. 
 It's okay. 
 Hey. 
 Do you remember, uh... 
 You remember when... When you were little and we used to... We used to say that poem, the one that would make our fears magically go away? 
 You used to know it by heart. 
 Twinkle, twinkle, little star... 
 You remember? 
 Huh? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Twinkle, twinkle, little star. 
 How I wonder what you are. 
 All right? 
 Up above the world so high. 
 Like a diamond in the sky. 
 When the blazing sun is gone, when he nothing shines upon. 
 Minx, say the words, honey. 
 No. 
 Hey, I need you to... 
 I don't want to do this. 
 Okay, then you shine your little light twinkle, twinkle all the night. 
 Okay? 
 You're testing me. 
 Baby, it's just... 
 [Sniffles] 
 I can't... I can't think of the words right now. 
 My brain's fuzzy. 
 Daddy. Daddy, please. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's okay. 
 [Sobbing] Daddy, please. 
 It's okay. 
 No. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay, sweetheart. 
 You don't have to say the words. 
 [Sniffles] 
 You're my dad. You're supposed to believe me. 
 [Whimpering] 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Sobbing] 
 Girl : Why didn't Minx tell us she was Drill all along? 
 Boy : They've me these questions all day. 
 Why can't I just go home? 
 Girl : We shared all our secrets together. 
 I don't know what to tell them. 
 Drill is just our friend. 
 I don't know what I did wrong. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Henry? 
 Are you there? 
 It's Minx. Can you hear me? 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 I need your help. 
 You need to talk to your mom, tell her I'm not Drill. 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 I swear, Henry, I'm not Drill. 
 You have to help me. 
 Please. 
 Do you know what they're gonna do to me? 
 Aren't you my friend, Henry? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Henry, why aren't you answering me? 
 They're gonna kill her, Claire. 
 She's my daughter. I cannot let that happen. 
 Wes, that's not Minx. 
 Even if you're right and Drill has taken possession of her, that doesn't mean she's gone. 
 What if, somewhere inside her body, my daughter's still alive? 
 Thomas Harcourt said that when... 
 Thomas was 8 years old when it happened. 
 What if he was wrong? 
 And what if he  wasn't? 
 Wes, we already missed our chance to end this once before. 
 Yes, and my wife was killed, so I am well aware of the consequences, Claire. 
 [Sighs] 
 Minx... 
 Is all I have left. 
 If I lose her... 
 So I need you to look at me and tell me that you are certain she has gone. 
 That is not fair. 
 Look at me in the eye and tell me she's dead, that the promise that I made to her when she was a little girl means nothing and that there is no hope that I will ever get her back. 
 And then... 
 Then I will believe you. 
 
 
 
 Haley : Sir, we have good news. 
 We now know which of the children has been possessed. 
 Who? 
 It's Wes Lawrence's daughter. 
 I know. It's unfortunate. 
 My daughter, she's... 
 Perfectly fine. 
 The other children, they're... they're all safe. 
 So we could release them, then. 
 With all due respect, uh, we don't know how much influence he still has over them. 
 Right now, the most prudent course of action is to keep them all locked up until we know for sure Drill has been neutralized. 
 Yes. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 I know I made the wrong call, Haley. 
 Excuse me? 
 I shouldn't have let him go. 
 I know that now. 
 This time, we'll make the right decision. 
 The questions is, how? 
 I believe we actually have the perfect weapon to accomplish our task. 
 Sean : Three months ago, I was sent to the Arctic to test an experimental weapon. 
 It was an electron-pulse device designed to emit an electrical charge equivalent to 100 lightning strikes. 
 Unfortunately... Things didn't go as planned. 
 We brought him to us. 
 He saw the energy, and he came right at me. 
 "He"? 
 When I saw that blue light... 
 That was when I knew that something was here. 
 "Something"? 
 Something not human. 
 Wes : I just need more time. 
 Where are the guards? 
 Oh, God. 
 No! 
 I'm sorry, Wes. 
 Where is she?! 
 You have to believe me. 
 I take no solace in what needs to be done. 
 Sir, you don't have to do this now. 
 I just need a few more days, so... 
 To what? 
 T... To remove Drill from her body. 
 So now you're talking about exorcism? 
 Listen to yourself. 
 Sir... 
 No more negotiations, Wes. Please. 
 We're going to end this today. 
 No, no. I'm sorry, sir. 
 It's best if you weren't here for this. 
 Sir, sir. 
 Please, you can't... you can't do this. 
 Please, escort them out. 
 You can't do this. She is an 8-year-old child! 
 Mr. Secretary, please, give us... 
 Damn it! 
 Talking about using this thing on a child? 
 Haley : It's not a child, sir. It's an alien threat. 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 Do it. Just get it over with. 
 I'm not leaving here! 
 Get off me! 
 Wes. Wes, Wes, Wes, Wes. 
 [Guns cock] 
 [Panting] 
 I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry. 
 There has to be another way, Claire. 
 There has to be another way. 
 [Vehicles approaching] 
 What is that? 
 That's how they're gonna do it. 
 That's how they're gonna kill Minx. 
 [Panting] 
 We have to do whatever it takes. 
 We have to save her. 
 Sean : What happens if the president says no? 
 That's not an option. 
 This isn't on you, Claire. 
 Isn't it? 
 You did what you had to do, just like I did. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I just talked to a reporter, gave him the whole story. 
 Sean, why would you do that? 
 Because this exposes everything. 
 They'll be forced to let our kids go. 
 That's the only way we get Henry back home. 
 I have to go. 
 I'll call you as soon as I can. 
 I just got off with the press secretary. 
 Now it's their move. 
 Wes : My contact at the White House, she's not making any promises, but she's trying to get us a meeting. 
 Okay. Let's go. 
 Mr. President, I'm sorry for the interruption. 
 Excuse me, gentlemen. 
 Uh... We got a call from the  Baltimore Observer. 
 They, uh... 
 They know about Drill. 
 How long do we have? 
 Well, they say about two hours, but I'm confident I can get them to hold the story... 
 That won't be necessary. 
 Excuse me? 
 It'll all be over in about two hours. 
 I want to go live before the story breaks. 
 Sir, I have to advise against... 
 Do you understand the kind of panic that this could cause? 
 No more than if the leader of this nation is caught lying to the very people who elected him. 
 No more hiding. No more secrets. 
 This is what must be done. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Oh, and, Alan, one more thing. 
 Get those children home. 
 I want my daughter back. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Where are they taking us? 
 How should I know? 
 [Engines shut off] 
 Man :  In a few minutes, we're gonna go live to the White House, where President Winters has called a last-minute press conference. 
 Wes : Please. We don't have much time. 
 Okay, I just... I need... 
 Wes, I'm... 
 I need five minutes with him. 
 Wes, I'm trying, but now this press conference has come up. look, you just... you just tell him that... that there's an alternative, okay? 
 We don't have to pull the trigger right now. 
 He'll know what I'm talking about. 
 Okay. I'm trying. 
 Please. 
 You don't understand how important this is. We don't have time. 
 Okay. 
 Please. 
 [Computer beeping] 
 [Sighs] I can't tell you what a relief that is. 
 I'll be right there. Thank you. 
 [Beeps] 
 They're letting the kids out. 
 So it worked. Looks like Oberon came through. 
 What's Oberon? 
 Secret service code name for the president. 
 Each family member of the family has one. 
 They all start with the same letter... first lady, she's Olympia. 
 And what about the daughter? 
 Uh, don't know that one off the top of my head. 
 Sean. 
 Orion. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 [Beeps] 
 Sean, I can't... I can't talk right now. 
 Claire, it's Cassandra. She's Drill. 
 What? 
 Orion... it's Cassandra's secret service code name. 
 What? 
 You were right. 
 It isn't Minx. 
 Copy that. Olympia and Orion on the move. 
 He's in the White House. 
 Drill framed Minx. 
 So Cassandra burned herself. 
 Henry?! She must have. 
 Minx? 
 With the evacuation of the children, there was so much chaos that we... we weren't looking at her. We were looking at Minx. 
 What about Silas? He said he saw Minx. 
 He was telling the truth about everything but who he saw. 
 It was Cassandra who caught him. 
 She's the one who threatened to hurt his mom. 
 What about Maria's computer file? 
 Cassandra knew that we'd be able to retrieve it, so she doctored Minx's file. 
 Oh, Claire, I... 
 Go. 
 Stop them. I'll try to get to the press room. 
 Okay. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Children shouting excitedly] 
 Woman : Honey! 
 Man : Hey, buddy. 
 Girl : Mommy, daddy, I'm here! 
 Henry? 
 Dad! 
 Okay. Come here. 
 Assistant : I'm sorry, Mr. Lawrence, but Secretary Frommer is not available. 
 Tell him it's not Minx. It's Cassandra. 
 I can leave word that it's urgent. 
 Damn it! 
 [Shakily] Twinkle, twinkle, little star... 
 [Voice breaking] How I wonder what you are. 
 Up above the world [sniffles] so high... 
 Like a diamond in the sky. 
 [Breathing shakily] 
 When the blazing sun is gone... 
 When he nothing shines upon... 
 Then you show your little light. 
 Twinkle, twinkle... 
 All the night. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Cassandra : You look nervous. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, I suppose I am a little. 
 Do you remember what you always tell me when I'm scared? 
 "Be brave." 
 All right, well, I will, uh... I will try to keep that in mind. 
 Wait, w-what are you... what are you saying? 
 The president, he's the target? 
 Claire : But it doesn't make any sense. 
 If Drill wanted to kill the president, he could've possessed Cassandra a long time ago. 
 Why wait this long? 
 Press conference. 
 He's not after the president. 
 What do you mean? 
 The broadcast. 
 Jessup, it's a live feed. 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 I'm Special Agent Claire Bennigan. 
 Please, I need you to listen to me. 
 The press conference... You have to stop it. 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to step back. 
 You don't understand. This is how he's gonna do it. 
 Winters : My fellow Americans... 
 To friends watching around the world... 
 Be brave. 
 That's what my daughter said to me before I walked in here. 
 Such simple words from a child, but not always easy to do. 
 [Minx sobs] 
 Then the traveler in the dark... 
 Thanks you for your tiny spark... 
 [ Sobs ] 
 Mr. Secretary. 
 I'm sorry, sir. It's... i can't. 
 Walk me through each step of the launch sequence. 
 I'll push the button. 
 Be brave. 
 We all do. 
 'Cause what I am about to tell you may be hard to accept. 
 Halt! 
 [Engine revs] 
 Halt! Don't move! 
 Stop! Look out! 
 We're on him! 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Tires screech] 
 For the last few weeks, our country, our world, has been battling a secret war provoked by a silent and deadly enemy, an enemy unlike any which we've fought before... an enemy not from our world. 
 [Murmuring] 
 This being did not come to our world in peace. 
 But before we succumb to panic,  I am here to tell you that this war is over and we have won. 
 The alien threat has been captured, contained. By the time that we are done here, it will have been destroyed. Woman :  Sequence initiated. Weapon will fire in 60 seconds. What's the matter, sweetheart? Weapon will fire in 50 seconds. I'm ready to see my mommy now. Weapon will fire in 30 seconds. Wes : Sir! [Banging on door] Sir, it's not Minx! She's not Drill! What is he doing in here? Please open the door, sir! No. No. No. She's gonna do it. Wes, you do not want to be here. It's Cassandra! It's the president's daughter! Sir!  Weapon will fire in 15 seconds. She's gonna send the signal. [Shrieking violently] 10... 9... Tech aide : Mr. Secretary. 8... 7... There's been an incident at the White House. 6... Yeah? 5... 4... Oh, my God. Stop the countdown. ...3 ...2 ... Sequence aborted. [Indistinct murmuring] [Gasping] Cassandra? [Breathing heavily] Henry : Is that Drill? Sean : Yeah. It is. Did he send the signal? [Static] I think so. What does this mean? It means we're in trouble. [First lady sobbing] My angel. What happened? Don't worry, Claire. I'm not going anywhere. [Sobbing] No, daddy. It's okay. Get me out! It's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Get me out! Okay. It's all right. It's all right. Okay. It's okay. [Whimpering] Come here. Here we go. All right, okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. All right. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You're safe now. I knew you'd come for me, daddy. [Sighing] Okay. All right. All right. It's okay. It's okay. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are. Wes : Minx? I was just saying the poem you taught me. Oh. What? Did you have another bad dream? I'm okay. I'm not scared. Oh. Well, I'm very proud of you. But just so you know, if you ever are scared, if you ever need me, I promise I'll always be here. I know, daddy. There.
