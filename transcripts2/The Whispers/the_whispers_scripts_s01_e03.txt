 Previously on "The Whispers"... 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Drill. He says you're "it." 
 [Gasps] 
 My friend Drill. He speaks through the lights. 
 Jackson Bellings, age 10. 
 Detonated a homemade bomb at Westings Designs. 
 "Under the influence of an imaginary entity named 'Drill.'" 
 There was someone across the street, watching the building. 
 Jessup :  Clearly this guy is Drill. He's convincing the children to do stuff. 
 [Gasps] 
 You know who he is. 
 It might be my husband. 
 He was my patient last night. 
 He doesn't remember anything. 
 All he knew was the last three months. 
 Sean :  But I've been having these dreams. 
 I don't know what they mean, but they're important. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 A maze? Where does it lead to? 
 Alex :  Your 8-year-old daughter downloaded top-secret defense files? 
 If Sean is here, why didn't he come home? 
 Ever since you were with her, everything has gone wrong. 
 There's something I need to do. You're gonna help me. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Henry :  [Imitating airplane engines] 
 [Imitating gunfire] 
 Mayday, mayday! I'm hit! Repeat! I'm hit! 
 [Deep voice] Captain Bennigan, save yourself, come home. 
 [Normal voice] No way I'm letting this guy go. 
 [Imitates gunfire] 
 I got it. I'm coming home. 
 [Imitates airplane engine] 
 Made it safe and sound. 
 Claire :  Please. Talk to me. 
 You can't just leave like this, Sean. 
 Say something. 
 [Sighs] I can't... 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 These past two years, ever since Henry's... 
 Don't. Don't blame me for that. 
 I don't. I don't. I don't. 
 God, Sean, when did it get so hard to talk to you? 
 I don't know, Claire. 
 Why don't you ask your conscience? 
 You can't just volunteer for a mission... 
 And leave. 
 [Zipper closes] 
 We have to talk about these things. 
 If you think running away is gonna fix anything... 
 Who says I want to fix this? 
 Don't say that, not after everything we've been through. 
 Why? 
 [Sighs] 
 Why did you do it, Claire? 
 Please. 
 Answer me one question... 
 Do you love him? 
 No. 
 But you had to think about it. 
 What about Henry? 
 What do I tell him? 
 [Breathing raggedly] 
 [Door closes] 
 Willie :  Claire? 
 Aren't you going into the office? 
 No. 
 Mom... 
 Claire, what is it? 
 He's alive. 
 Sean is alive. 
 Aw, honey... 
 [Sighs] 
 I... 
 No, I know. 
 It sounds crazy, but I'm not crazy. 
 I saw him. 
 And he saw me, too. 
 Only it was like... 
 It was like he was looking through me, like... 
 Like he didn't even know who I was. 
 I talked to a doctor who treated him two days ago. 
 She said that... [Sniffles] that clearly he's experiencing some kind of... of memory loss. 
 At least that explains why he didn't come home. 
 This wouldn't be the first time he didn't. 
 No, that was different, Mom. 
 He blamed himself for what happened to Henry, and he just... he couldn't... no,  he  didn't blame himself... you did. 
 Decisions are easy. 
 It's living with the consequences that's the hard part. 
 And for a while... 
 Neither of us was very good at that. 
 Sean was not a perfect husband. 
 Yeah. God knows I was not a perfect wife. 
 But, he... Mom, he's back, and... 
 What they are saying about him, what they think he's done... 
 I can't believe it. 
 I have to find out what's really happening. 
 We have a 50-mile search perimeter in effect. 
 All state and local uniforms are on alert. 
 I'm confident, sir. He can't hide too long. 
 And Agent Bennigan, where's her head on this? 
 Well, she hasn't come in. 
 She hasn't answered her phone. 
 But if... [Sighs] But if I may be Frank, sir... 
 You think she's a liability. 
 I think any involvement would be seriously imprudent. 
 I'm not gonna disagree with you there. 
 This one's yours. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 But let me just put a little perspective on this for you... you're hunting down a man thought to be the deceased husband of one of your colleagues. 
 Whether he is in fact guilty, your investigation will bare that out. 
 But let's save the judgment on Agent Bennigan. 
 She'll take care of her business, you take care of yours. 
 Sean :   Jag 37! Jag 37! 
 I am off flight plan! Repeat, I am off flight plan! Man :   Do you read me, Captain Bennigan? Please respond. Over. I'm losing altitude! Jag 37! Captain Bennigan, can you hear me? Does anyone hear me? I'm losing altitude. Do you copy? Jag 37! I'm punching out! Eject, eject, eject! [ Static, warbling ] I've lost him. I... I got nothing. He's not on the radar. [  Warbling ] [  Whispering ] [  Screeching ] Captain Bennigan, do you read me? Over. [Knock on door, door opens] Renee :  Sir? I'm sorry, but they're ready for you. Okay. [Sighs] [Door closes] Security footage from the bombing at Westings. [Sighs] With all due respect sir, why are we looking at a place Sean Bennigan was a month ago? The last confirmed spotting of the suspect was last night. Sean Bennigan is a highly trained soldier. If anyone knows how to hide, it's him. We need to go back and learn what he's after. And what am I always telling you guys? Sometimes the best way to find where a man is going... Both :  Find out where he's been. Thank you. Play. Willa :  Jackson Bellings, age 10. Mother worked at Westings... that's how he got inside. Three casualties. Any sign of Bennigan? Not in any of the footage. Play it again. [Click] Stop right there. [Click] What's he looking at? Uh, s-slow it down. Frame by frame. [Keyboard clacking] There. In the corner. Looks like he's waiting for something. Not something... someone. There's... there's a door in the hallway. Someone just walked in. Whose office is that? David Miller, one of the victims. He wasn't just a victim. He was the target. Where are you taking me? Please, I have money. I can get you $10,000 right now... maybe more. I was supposed to be at work by now, they'll be looking for me. Are you listening? That woman, the one who's looking for me, who is she? She's with the FBI. What do they know about me? Dr. Rosen :  So, you said his name was Drill, right? And what makes Drill such a good friend? I don't know. Is he a good listener? And what else? He doesn't keep secrets from me. He always tells me the truth. And that's important to you, knowing the truth? But you can't actually see Drill. Isn't that right? Why does everyone care about that? [Sighs] Because they're worried about you. Drill tells you to do things... things that get you in trouble. [Sighs] Like Daddy's computer? Exactly. Now, you knew that was wrong, didn't you? But Drill said he needed me and I was the only one who could do it. Minx... Now, you're 8 now. You know the difference between right and wrong, real and imaginary. [Sighs] You don't have to invent friends, Minx. There are a lot of people, real people in your life, who want to be there for you. But Drill needs me. No. Drill's not real. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you, Minx? That I should stop playing with Drill because he isn't real? Exactly. So, right here, right now it stops. Can you do that, Minx? Good. It's just... What? [Sighs] I don't think Drill's gonna like this. The best way to find where someone's going... [Sighs] is to find out where they've been. Brent :  The bombing target... David Miller, low-level tech at Westings. We interviewed his daughter, said he was acting strange in the weeks prior to his death, thought he was being followed, people were tapping his phones. Turns out, maybe he was right. What do you mean? Well, two minutes before he was killed, he sent an e-mail. Somehow it got corrupted in transit, bounced back, never reached the intended recipient. The main body of the e-mail was un-retrievable, but the attachment... We managed to salvage this. What exactly am I looking at here? We're not sure, but check out who the recipient of the e-mail was supposed to be... page three. You're sure this is him? Yeah, the head of the nuclear regulatory commission. I need to know where he is now. [Monitor beeping] Vitals are looking stable. Diagnosis good. [Knock on door] I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't realize you were with a patient. It's okay. I'm just examining my mommy. Well, she's lucky to have such great care. Oh, she does. She has my friend. He's going to fix her. Oh, he sounds like a great friend. He's the best friend in the world. Hey, uh, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for Harrison Weil, and I was told I could find him here. That's my daddy. Are you gonna ask him the questions like they were asking me? Who was asking you questions? Claire. Do you know her, too? Minx :  Will Daddy be home for dinner? Don't know, sweetie, but I'm sure he'll try. Daddy always tries. Why don't you run ahead and wait in the car, and I'll be there in just a minute. Okay. [Sighs] So? Dr. Rosen :  Well, I think we made some really good progress. Minx seems to understand that Drill is not real. [Car door closes] Ah, I can't tell you what a relief that is to hear. But I still think she should continue to see me, you know, get to the real root of the problem. What do you? [Sighs] The fact that an imaginary friend manifested in her life at this age is actually quite unusual. Now, most times, this kind of behavior is indicative of a lack of stability, something she's having a hard time understanding, maybe problems at home or... My husband and I, we're... Working out some things. It's fine. [Chuckles] I mean, lots of families have problems, right? Of course they do. I just wanted to offer. If you were interested... [Beeping] Oh, thank you. It's just not really a good time right now. [Static] [Indistinct conversation] [Warbling] I can't do it. The doctor says you're not real, Drill. He won't let me play with you anymore. ♪  Play nice, play nice, people  ♪ 
♪  ho, ho, ho, ho  ♪ 
♪  play nice, play nice, people  ♪ 
♪  oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh  ♪ Drill, stop it. [Volume increases] ♪ play nice, play nice, people  ♪ [Radio turns off] [Bell dings] [Breathes shakily] Don't. [Bell dings] What do you want? [Cash register beeping] Oh. Shaving cream. Razors. There... scissors. Pay. Ask for the restroom. [Bell dings] [Cash register beeping] Man :  That'll be $18.97. Bathroom? Around the side of the building. [Bell dings] What the hell are you doing, Sean? You know they're going to find you. They haven't found me yet. You said you needed help. What do you want me to do? Where are we going? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? You kidnapped me for a reason! You must know! I don't know. I never know... not until I get there. That's how this works. [Telephone ringing] [Ringing continues] [Click] Jessup : Hello? Hello. Claire Bennigan's line. But... We got him. 
 
 [Monitor beeping] Wes :  Uh, so, your daughter said the FBI had been asking some... questioning her. Yeah, they wanted to talk to my daughter, something to do with my wife's accident, but why is the D.O.D. Suddenly interested... No, sorry. We're not. I actually... I came about something else. Someone at Westings Designs tried to send you this... Right before he was killed. We're curious if you know what it's about. How long ago was this? About a month. Why? Do you have any idea what you have here? [Sighs] Hi. [Door opens, closes] I'm looking for someone. He was... he was in here a few days ago. I have many customers. I can't help you. What about this? Can you tell me what these numbers mean? Someone scribbled them down. How am I supposed to know? And... and this... this man, do you recognize him? No. Look again. I have never seen that man before. Maria :  Listen... You need help. That's why you're here. No, I mean professional help. I'm not a psychiatrist, but they could try to figure out what happened, how you lost your memory. Oh, I went and saw one of those a few months back. And? He said I was crazy. [Breathes shakily] Please. Please just let me go. [Electricity crackling] I promise I won't tell anyone. You have my word. Please. [Sobs] [Sirens wailing in distance] [Engine revs] [Sirens wailing] [Crackling continues] [Whispering] What are you doing? Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh. I'm listening. To what? [Sirens wailing] It's a message. [Muttering] What's it saying? Run. [Tires screech] [Sirens wailing] [Tires screech] [Guns cock] They're gone. You can't be here. Please, I just have a few questions. You must leave. If he catches you... Just tell me... [Paper rustles] What is this? You don't understand. I do. I understand that this is a hawala. People come here to send and receive money from overseas. And I also understand that some hawalas are used to move illicit money. I don't care. I don't care what you're doing. I'm just... I'm just looking for this man. He's my husband. Please. Please. I'm not leaving until I get some answers. The numbers on the receipt, it's an account. Your husband, he's been here a few times. Yesterday, he received a payment. Yesterday? And before that? Maybe a month ago. That's Westings. We don't always get to choose who our husbands become. Now, please, you must go. [Indistinct conversations] [Metal grinding] What do you want from me? Just tell me what to do. I need you to help me. I need you to help me get here. I don't understand. Where is... I don't know until I get there... just like all the other times. Wait. So, each of your tattoos, they... they represent a place? Sometimes a person. I told you I don't know until I get there. What happens when you do? [Engine turns over] Nothing good. Drive. [Gear clicks] [Engine shuts off] Mm. Hi. I hoped I wasn't. But it turns out, that's exactly what I was doing. [Sighs] I just have to make one last call, and I'll be in after that, okay? Yeah. Yeah, how did you know? [Chuckles] Just give us a minute, okay? [Chuckles] [Sighs] Wes... Claire... It's about Sean. I know why he came back, and I know what he's gonna do. Who? You said he was getting money from somewhere in the middle east? Once, just before the Bellings bombing, and then again yesterday. Okay, it... it all... it all fits. He's... he's gonna make his next play. And what is it? Wes? Tell me. Okay. [Zipper opens] This was... This was found by a tech at Westings Industrial. It's a-a cooling pipe at one of the nuclear plants that Westings provided for. These here... these are bad. Now, the tech was gonna report it until a kid named Jackson Bellings... Claire :  Detonated a bomb in his building. So the message never got to where it was supposed to go... The head of the nuclear regulatory commission... Harper's father. whose annual safety-inspection trip was cut short because his wife was in an accident. And that's how it's all... Yeah, it's all... all connected. [Sighs] So, what? We... [Sighs] Sean is trying to cause some kind of meltdown? Yes. But the problem is, we don't know where. Uh, the... The commission will send inspectors to each facility, but we need to know where Sean is headed today. Okay. Okay, let's... Think like him. He uses kids, right? But not just any kids. He chooses them carefully. They all have access or information that he wants. Okay, well, how does he get them to help? Brainwash, bribery... No, that's how this... Imaginary friend comes in. A what? I don't know. I don't know how Sean does it, but each of these kids claims to have a friend named Drill that no one else can see. Claire. What? Minx... She has a friend named Drill. [Rain falling] Somewhere up ahead, there's gonna be a road on the right. When you get there, turn. It's further. It's further. It's further. It's further on. Just go further. What do you think you're seeing? I can't explain it. It's like déjÃ  vu. I just... It just feels familiar. It's hard to have déjÃ  vu when you've got no memories. [Breathes deeply] Keep your eyes on the road. [Breathing heavily] Let go. We're getting close. I feel it. The next left. There, there. Take it. [Exhales sharply] Right again. Again. [Tires squeal] I feel it. How about I ask  you  a question? Why did you have a gun in your house? You afraid of somebody? The only person I'm scared of right now is holding a gun at me. [Engine revving] [Tires screeching] [Air hissing] Minx, I'm Claire. I know who you are. You do? You're the lady who makes Mommy cry. This is our home. You brought that woman into our home. Minx might be our only chance of finding out where Sean is. I didn't have a choice. I'm sorry. He  did. He chose to use Minx because of what you did... what both of you did. I swear to you, if anything happens to my little girl... I'm sorry. I am. But grown-ups... [Sighs] We make mistakes, sometimes big ones. I am trying my best to make up for it. And we can talk about that some other time if you want to, but right now I have to ask you some important questions. I need to know about Drill. No. Drill's not real. Dr. Rosen said so. [George Bizet's "Habanera" plays] [Woman singing in French] You know that's not true, don't you, Minx? You know that Drill is real. He asked you to play a game, didn't he? What did he ask you to do? You're just trying to confuse me. I just need the truth, Minx. Tell me about this game. We played lots of games, but not anymore. I stopped talking to him, and he got mad. Maybe if I stop talking to you, you'll go away, too. ["Habanera" continues] I can't go away, Minx, not until I know what Drill had you do. I don't care. I don't want to talk to you. [Voice breaking] I hate you. I hate you. Stop it. Can't you see you're upsetting her? Hey, honey. Hey. It's okay. No. I hate you, too. Mm. Oh. [Sighs] I know you're upset. Hey. Mommy, make her go away. She's gonna hurt us. [Sighs] We need her right now. [Inhales sharply] Mommy, no. Minx, please. Please. Tell her about the game. Okay. ["Habanera" continues] [Horn honks] [Thud] [Tires spinning] [Car door opens] Man :  Oh, my God! Call 911! Call 911! Can you hear me?! Can you hear me?! Come on. Hello? Hello? Yes. Yes, I need an ambulance. Um, we're on the corner of Lexington and 8th. Lexington and 8th. Lexington. Minx :  He wanted me to go on Daddy's computer and look for the treasure. And what was the treasure? It was these... F-funny-looking pictures, like a maze. Minx. [Clicking] Is this the picture? Only a s-small part of it. There's more. I can show you. What do you mean, honey? I have the papers upstairs in my room. [Insects chirping] [Grunting] [Breathing heavily] [Whimpering] It's... it's some wiring schematic, some kind of electrical grid. And this... It's the logo for the Harbor Point nuclear power plant. That's where Sean's going. Wes :  I understand what I am asking, and, yes, I need that to happen now. And that's all the gas attendant saw? Believe me, I understand what I'm asking. When? No, no. I'm on my way. Okay. [Beep] Sean, he has a hostage. It's Dr. Benavidez. What... what does she have to do with anything? Okay, I just spoke to the security guy at Harbor Point. They're putting it on lockdown. Honey, I need to go. It's okay. Go. [Sighs] I'll call you. [Engine turns over] [Car departs] [Breathing heavily, whimpering] [Electricity crackling] Somebody help me! Help! Somebody! [Breathing heavily] I told you we're here. [Wind gusting] No. Don't, don't! [Crackling stops] [Breathing shakily] [Alarm beeping] Hey, take a look at this. Could be a sensor malfunction. Maybe. Protocol says to call it in. [Cellphone vibrating] [Monitor beeping] [Whispering] [Beep] [Beep] [Beep] Mommy? [Indistinct talking over P.A.] Drill, I did what you said. [Whispering] Mommy! [Weakly] Harper. What happened? Where am I? I knew he was gonna do it. I knew he was gonna help you. [Door opens] Oh, my God. Mommy's fixed, Daddy. Drill saved her. [Sighs] Henry :  [Crying] Please, Drill. Find him. [Sniffles] Find my daddy and bring him home. I promise... I'll do anything. Please, Drill. [Electricity crackles]
