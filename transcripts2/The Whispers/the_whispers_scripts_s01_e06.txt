 Previously on "The Whispers"... 
 Claire : Each of these kids claims to have a friend named Drill... [Electricity crackles] that no one else can see. 
 Wes : Minx was not chosen at random. 
 She was chosen because of my job. 
 She does exactly what this "Drill" thing wants. 
 Drill's the one who brought daddy home. 
 Aren't you happy? 
 Wes : Claire, he's not the same person. 
 He is. He's just forgotten. 
 It's pretty clear you and I weren't friends before, were we? 
 I have to go back to where it all started. 
 The answers we need, they're... they're there. 
 [Groans] 
 They found it. 
 [Warbling] 
 [Rumbling] 
 Captain :  Mr. Lawrence, we apologize for the turbulence. 
 We're beginning our descent into Andrews air force base. 
 If you wouldn't mind sitting down and buckling up, we'll be on the ground in about 30 minutes. [Electricity crackling] [Rumbling continues] [Electricity crackles] [Whispering] Henry? Henry? Henry? Henry, where are you? [Thud] [Gasps] Hi. Henry? Did you have a good sleep? Henry? I know these kids. They're Drill's friends. [Sighs] [Smooches] That's right. You met Minx. She came to the house. What about them? Why do you have their pictures? Because I am trying to get to know Drill and how he picks his friends. What about the others? What do you mean, "others?" There's more, mommy. Drill has lots of friends. [Sighs] Minx : I miss you, daddy. Wes : I miss you, too, sweetheart. How's everything there? You and your mommy having a good day? I guess so. Where are you? At work. At your office? No. No, I have to be somewhere else today. Where? Kind of far. In a special place. Special how? Like... Secret? I... I can't talk about it right now. Maybe later, when we're all together, okay? I have to go now. I'll be home as soon as I can. Okay, I love you. I love you, too. [Beep] [Sighs] I'm sorry Drill. He wouldn't tell me where he brought it. [Whispering] [Sighs] Dr. Catherine Tully. Mr. Lawrence. Thank you for coming. There are very few people we could call under these circumstances. When we spoke on the phone... I... I know. You... you thought it was a prank. [Scoffs] When you dedicate your life to studying the outer reaches of the universe, you come across your fair share of crazies. [Chuckles] You could say the same thing about politics. [Both laugh] Well... Are you ready to see it? I believe I am. Yes. This way. Extraordinary. Is it... Some kind of meteorite? We were hoping you could tell us. That blue... It... it's like nothing I've ever... careful. It seems to hold some kind of a charge. You've touched it? Yeah, in... in transport, there was turbulence. Mm-hmm. A-and... And... What? [Sighs] It's hard to explain. It seemed like it was... It was defending itself. [Scoffs] You do realize we are making history. [Clears throat] History's already been made, Dr. Tully. This... Is about the future. But you'll have access to whatever you need. All we ask in return are answers. Is it a weapon? A vessel? Where did it come from? How did it get here? I'm sure I don't have to remind you how vital it is that until we know what we're dealing with here, we maintain complete and total secrecy over the situation. Of course, sir. Yes, sir. How's Henry? He misses you. He doesn't understand. [Sighs] Sean, I... Thank you for visiting. I... I know they're... they're not making it... [Breathes deeply] Easy. Yeah, of course. I wish I remembered... Us. It'll come. Don't worry. Sean, I need to ask you something about your tattoos. Henry, he... He told me that there are other children who have been contacted by Drill. Whatever your connection is to him, I was hoping... I could help you find them. Yes. [Sighs] I'm sorry. Uh... My mind, it's... What is it? It's... it's just... This feeling. It's... it's like... A pull. Like one of your visions? No, this is different. This is like something is grabbing me from the pit of my stomach and pulling. When did it start? Last night. I haven't... I haven't felt like this since, uh... Since the desert. Not since Mali. Wes... Went to Africa yesterday, to Mali. What for? I don't know. Did he find something? I don't know. I don't know. I'll ask him. I... I got a message. I'm meeting him. Claire, whatever... whatever's happening, promise me... promise me that you'll... you don't remember this about me. But I'm pretty good at taking care of myself. That's not what I'm worried about. I'm glad you made it back, Wes. I'm sorry. I was really worried. No, it's... it's... it's okay. I called Lena when I couldn't find you. It's all... Claire. It's okay. I'm fine. I just... I'm sorry. Okay, I'm fine. Claire. I hope she didn't think that... I'm okay. Look, I... I wanted to call you. It's just... the answers, they just... they just came so quickly. The answers to what? Where the fulgurite came from. Wes... I... I found something in the desert in Mali, something beyond incredible. It may be the key to understanding Drill. I mean... It may... It may explain everything, Claire. You... You don't seem to be... Because I knew. Sean... he told me that he felt something. Oh, of course he did. Okay. That he hasn't felt since the desert... After his crash. And you believe him? Come on, Wes. You know as well as I do that he's connected to this thing somehow. Yeah. What exactly did you find out there? What is it? I... I can't. I already said too much. There... there... there are... you... you can't tell me? Look, there are people who I answer. It's not like the bureau where we could just share. Oh, no. Don't pull that, Wes. Don't big-time me like you are some... Okay, that's not what I am doing! It's... It's not what I'm doing, okay? I wish I could share this with you, but... You think you're in control of this thing? You think all the answers just... just came together? You were led to Mali by a child. Your secretary's son, under the direction of his imaginary friend... I'll let you go ahead and guess what his name is. It's time you stop thinking about what you found and start thinking about why you found it. Drill wanted it here for a reason. Someone better find out what that reason is... Before... Before what? Hmm? Before it's too late. [Car door closes] [Engine turns over] Claire : You want answers. I can get them for you. You think a group of children can tell us what happened in the meltdown at Harbor Point? I think they can tell us a whole lot more than that if you will just let me talk... Claire, I can't put you back on this case. Think of who's involved... your husband, your son. Because of what my son told me, we have already tracked down another kid who is involved in this case. 7 year old boy caused a car accident. The guy on his bike was killed... A therapist. The kid said his friend Drill made him do it. Put them in a room together. Our best shot at figuring out what is really going on here is to get them to talk. What makes you so sure they will? That's what kids do. If one has a secret, it's... it's easy enough to stay quiet. But when they're with their friends, secrets become very hard to keep. [Sighs] [Siren wails in distance] Would you give us a minute? Thank you. [Clears throat] Where's Wes Lawrence on all of this? At the D.O.D. Following his own leads. He's not using you to run his game? No. No. Gathering the kids is my idea. But if we learn something from it, I will tell everyone that it was yours. You hold this here in house. Keep it small. Nobody else knows but us. Agreed. Thank you, sir. Uh-huh. Do you think you'll be able to get all the families to go along? Almost all of them. We're keeping it together. What about you? All I can do is keep Henry talking to me. As long as he's doing that, I... I figure maybe I have a chance. It's nice... Being able to talk to someone who understands. I assumed you and Wes had... No, it's... It's not the same. He's not a mom. Is this the part where I'm supposed to forgive you? I don't deserve your forgiveness, Lena. I'm not asking for it. Then why  are  you here? I am here because I am having a discussion group with the other kids who have been contacted by Drill to see what we can learn. I was h-hoping that you would let Minx... Be one of your guinea pigs. No. No. It will just be a quiet conversation. The other parents have agreed to participate. We don't know these people. I... I  don't know these families. What if... What if the other kids plant something in her head? What if getting them all together is exactly what Drill wants? Well, we don't know what Drill... Mommy? Yeah, um... Honey, did you need something? Can I watch TV? "The Red House" is on. Uh, yeah, sure. But just half an hour, okay? Okay. Look, I get it. You're the expert, and I'm just some stay-at-home mom. No, that has nothing... Claire. I know what's best for my daughter, and I'm not comfortable putting her in a room full of strangers, not when she's this vulnerable. We're all vulnerable. I'm sorry. Have your group, but Minx won't be there. [Door opens, closes] [Birds chirping] Frommer : So, uh, how are you handling all this, son? Wes : Fine, sir. I reckon this is the closest you've come to knowing what it feels like to face down the enemy. I have been fortunate in that way. Do you think it puts you at a tactical disadvantage? I don't understand. Never having been in battle, do you think it puts you behind the 8-ball when it comes to running this operation? I think if it wasn't for the work I've done, you wouldn't know there was a battle, sir. Touché. Well, I really, uh... I really just - wanted to congratulate you. Uh, when I first moved up the ranks, one of the hardest things for me to learn was how to delegate. It seems you're way ahead of the curve. I don't follow. Well, allowing Claire Bennigan to gather those children, ask them questions about Africa, about Drill. Oh, I, uh... You didn't...? I'm sorry. I just assumed... No, we... We discussed ways to gather intel. I just... See, see, see, uh, when you've actually been in battle, son, you learn even your allies need a little oversight. I trust Claire completely. Well, I trust my brother. Doesn't mean I'm gonna let him share a bed with my wife. I don't think Claire... Do you know who's gonna be there? Do you know the questions she's gonna ask? Is there a containment plan if there's any sensitive material disclosed? Let's try that question again. How are you handling all this, son? Agent Bennigan. I'm just... one second. What the hell is going on? I was going to ask you the same question. This is exactly what I didn't want... Cameras, security measures. Who ordered all this? Wes : I did. [Keys jingling] Captain Bennigan. Yes? Do you know who I am? I'm Hailey Frommer, Secretary of Defense. I don't get a lot of visitors here. Well, you can't break into a nuclear power plant and expect to be treated like a war hero. But I... I'm getting ahead of myself. Uh, tell me, Captain, do you know how you ended up in the middle of the Sahara Desert? No. No recollection of the mission you were on when it happened? No. Hmm. All right. But you didn't come all this way just to get answers you could have gotten from my polygraph, did you? Why  do  you think I'm here? Because the walls here have ears, and they heard me ask my wife what Wes Lawrence was doing in Mali. So why don't we just talk about that? Don't push your luck, friend. The last man that showed me this little respect is living out the rest of his days in Gitmo. I just want to know what happened to me,  sir,  and I have a feeling whatever Mr. Lawrence is doing in Mali might get me some of those answers. So you and I both want the same thing. It seems we just have different strategies on how to get it. See you soon, Captain. 
 
 [Knock on door] [Door opens] Claire : They're nervous. They won't open up in this environment. I know you. You'll draw them out. That's not the point. The point is you went behind my back. I gave their parents my word. If any of these kids know anything about what we're up against, we need to make sure... that it's contained? You gonna lock them up in some secret government site, too? I'm just trying to keep everyone safe. Do you really think I'd put my own daughter at risk? [Chuckles] You need to call home more. Claire, don't. Your wife... She said no. I guess she knows you better than I do. We never should have agreed to this. Honey, please. Our son was cleared of any charges. It was an accident. They just want to talk to the kids. I'm sure nothing will happen. I don't even know why I'm here. I just posted something on a mommy-and-me website about Jane's imaginary friend. Next thing I know, the FBI is calling. He's not imaginary. Excuse me? Trust me. He's real. Claire, you didn't say anything about cameras. They look like lab rats in there. What the hell is going on in here? My daughter just has an active imagination. Please, please, please. Please. I understand how you all are feeling. I seriously doubt that, Agent Bennigan. My son... he's in there, too. I know this is a lot more than what we discussed. What exactly are we dealing with? I don't know. I... I don't know. But I am hoping that by bringing the kids together, we can push everything out into the open. No more secrets. Do you promise us that they are going to be okay? I won't let anything happen to our kids. Let's get started. Agent bennigan. Can I speak with you a moment? Yeah, of course. It's about my wife. How is she? She's completely recovered. The doctors, they're not sure how it happened, but Harper says Drill did it. I... I don't know what to think. I know. When I say Amanda's better... Yeah? She's, um, having a hard time being back at home. She's scared. [Sighs] She can't sleep. She wakes up every half-hour to make sure Harper's still in bed. Last night, she wanted to lock the door to our room. It's killing her feeling this way. It's gonna take time. Yeah, but what if she's right? What... What if...? We... we can't see or hear this thing. So how in the hell are we supposed to protect our children from something like that? I know Claire. She's the lady who's gonna ask us questions. What kind of questions? About Drill. We shouldn't say anything. Drill wouldn't like it. She's my mom. But she's not Drill's friend. Lucas : They think I did something wrong, but I seriously did not know that man was gonna hit a car. Now Drill doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Maybe it's 'cause you turned. Drill doesn't like it when we get older. What are you doing? You know that's not a mirror. This is how they watch us. Minx : Yeah, I like you a lot. You're my friend. Mm-hmm. You're for sure my best friend. Mommy said I couldn't go. Some kind of play group. [Static] I think they're talking about you. Claire :  We're just here to talk. If any of this starts to feel uncomfortable, Okay? Henry : Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's begin. But we've already talked to you. I know, Harper. I know, but I thought that it would be nice for all of you to meet one another. You're all Drill's friends. Does Drill know that we're here right now? I didn't tell him. Me neither. Drill doesn't like it when we keep secrets from him. Claire : But Drill wants you to keep secrets from your parents. Does that seem right? Jane : But Drill helped me. I used to be afraid of the night. My mom and dad, they own a restaurant. They work very late, so our neighbor watches us. I'm afraid something bad will happen, like they might not come home. But Drill promised me he'll keep them safe. All I had to do was help you find your way. Drill said it was a treasure hunt. You helped me find my dad. Drill brought him back to us. He also made me hear again. When I was little, I got sick, and I lost my hearing. After that, I was all alone in my head. I didn't like that. But then I heard this voice. It was the coolest thing ever. And now I can hear everything again. Harper : See. Drill just wants to help us. Why can't you see that? I'm trying, Harper. But because Drill doesn't talk to grown-ups, sometimes it's hard. Why do you think that is? Why won't he talk to us? It's her. Henry's mom. She's the one who doesn't like you. So I don't like her. She's the one who doesn't like you. Jane : Maybe it's because grown-ups only hear what they want to hear. Drill doesn't like that. [Chuckles] But I'm listening to you now. I'm listening to all of you. Drill helped each of you get something. But what about him? What does he want? Kelly? Okay, this is it. Drill wanted something brought back here, something that he needed. Do you know why that is? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Does anyone know why? Maybe that was the thing he was talking about. What thing, Harper? It's okay. You can trust my mom. He said he was sad. He misses his family, like I missed my mommy when she was sick. So there are others? Others like Drill? I think so, but they're not here. [Electricity crackling] Drill had to come first. He had to find the food. [Static, crackling] Wes :  Claire? Claire! Jane? What's happening? It's him. He's here. [Warbling] [Breathing heavily] Claire, it's okay. We're coming in. Harper : Don't be mad, Drill! We wanted to tell you! Stay right here. Stay together. Drill! Wes? I'm scared of the dark. Wes, open the door, Wes. Open it. I can't. It's not working. We need to get them out of there right now. [ Indistinct shouting ] Sir, you need to see this. You didn't do anything wrong. Wes? It's okay. Let's... we're scared, Drill. I swear, I didn't talk! Ethan... Ethan, you didn't do anything wrong. None of you did. Shh. [Whimpering] What do you want from us? Why are you here? Harper! Lucas! It's locked! Stop, stop, stop! Stop, you're gonna scare them! [Muffled shouting] They're gonna open the door in two seconds. Your parents are right outside. Henry, Henry, what's going on? Ethan : Stop crying! Is Drill here? What's happening? He's not talking to me right now. What about you, Kelly? Is he saying anything? Wes : What is that? [Indistinct shouting] Step back! Step back! Please step back! Kelly, what is he saying? The door! Man : Open it! [Beeping] What's happening? Henry :  I hear him. Mommy, he's here with me. Henry, is he hurting you? No, it... it doesn't hurt. Wes : What's it doing? Claire? Claire! Harrison : Harper, honey?! Damn it! Lucas?! I'm right here! Take it, take it, take it. Get back! Here we come! Oh, God. Harrison : Harper?! Honey! Ethan? Step back from the door. Wes : Claire? [Electricity crackles] Harper... where is she? You okay? Henry, you okay? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What happened? Did you see anything? Yeah, we got it. Claire, we saw him. What do you mean, you saw him? On the thermal camera, he was... he was with Henry. Is he still? No, he's... he's gone. Do you know what this means? Kelly : Agent Bennigan? I have a message for you from Drill. Claire : What is it? He says you're not gonna win. What is he doing to my son? [Crying] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Sobbing] What is this? That is what the children call "Drill." He or it appears to be some form of energy. That's why he's able to manipulate electricity. Uh, sir, he's not... he's not just manipulating it. One of the children said he came here looking for food. That explains why there was no radiation after the meltdown. He consumed it. Catherine : I think we have something. Wes : Well, I'm glad to hear that. We were able to extract a core sample of the rock. The outer layers, they're known elements... Iron, nickel, iridium. But as we get closer to the inner layers, we can't determine the composition. We can assume that on its journey, it picked up various materials, creating an outer shell. We can't pinpoint the exact origin. But given the presence of aluminum and titanium alloys, we can at least posit the direction. Here. At some point during its journey, the rock passed through Chi Sagittarii, approximately 220 light-years from earth. So, you're saying whatever this is... it's definitely some kind of vessel. Dr. Tully? I'm getting something. What is it? It's emitting a frequency. It... It's weak, yes, but can we get a visual? Wes : What am I looking at here? It's like it's calling someone, something. It's communicating. With who? Sir. We have a situation with Captain Bennigan. Looks painful. You're a hard man to get ahold of. Oh, my God, Sean. It's okay, Claire. Your husband just wanted some attention. He wants answers, Wes. I'd say he's entitled to them. We both are. What did you find in Mali? You brought something back, didn't you? Did you tell him? No. How do you know, Sean? How do you know? Because something is calling me. Are you gonna let me answer? [Static] [Laughs] Mommy, why is that happening? It's... It's just some static. Minx. I want to meet your friend Drill. Do you think... Could I talk to him myself? I doubt it. He only talks to kids. I know, but he likes games, right? I know I'm a grown-up, but I'm a really good sport. That's true. How about this? We'll play a guessing game. You stand outside the door, I'll ask the questions, and you tell me what he says. It'll be fun. I... I don't know. [Whispering] [Electricity crackles] Mommy, Drill says yes. He wants to play with you. So, your boss paid me a visit. Is that right? Yeah, doesn't seem like a particularly forgiving man. You gonna catch hell for this? Mm, it depends. On what? If he finds out. You're married. Yeah. How long? Over 10 years now. You were young. We were. What's her name? Lena. Any kids? I... I have a daughter. She's 8. That's right. You mentioned her before. "Minx," wasn't it? Yeah. And she's caught up in all this, too. [Sighs] Looks like we have something in common. Okay, Minx. Uh... Ask Drill how many fingers I'm holding up. [Whispering] Three. Drill says to keep going. What am I holding in my hand? [Whispering] My headband. [Electricity crackles] [Whispering] Good news, mommy. Drill likes you. He says you can play with us. Thank you so much. You're the best mommy in the whole wide world. Be careful. [Whispering] [Rumbling] [Breathes deeply] [Distortion] Sean. Sean, what's happening? Hey, hey, look at me. You okay? Are you okay? [Breathing deeply] Claire. I remember. [Breathing shakily] I remember everything.
