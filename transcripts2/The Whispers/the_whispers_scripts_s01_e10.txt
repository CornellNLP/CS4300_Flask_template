 Previously on "The Whispers"... 
 My wish came true. 
 What did you wish for? 
 For Drill make you and daddy love each other again. 
 Here's what we know about the entity. 
 It travels electrically, through power cables, so it can be identified by a heat signature. 
 He uses kids, but not just any kids. 
 He chooses them carefully. They all have access. 
 Thomas : His whole planet was dying. 
 He needed to send a signal back to the others. 
 Mr. President, we learned how to kill Drill. 
 He can posses the body of a child. 
 Once he does, he can be destroyed. 
 Mr. Brewster : He never goes outside. 
 He's always on the computer. 
 Well, that's what kids do today. 
 They play on the computer. 
 Maybe we should take his away, then. 
 Let's just sign him up for some sports or... 
 He's not you. He doesn't like sports. 
 Well, we don't always get to do what we want, do we? 
 And you know what? It's about time Nicholas learned that. 
 Seriously? He is a 10-year-old boy. 
 Why don't you take him to the park? 
 I... I see other kids playing there all the time. 
 Yeah, the other kids pick on him. 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 [Whispering] 
 Who is that? 
 Who's there? 
 [Amplified whispering] 
 Stop it! Go away! 
 Just go away! Leave me alone! Stop it! Stop it! 
 [Crying] 
 Nicholas? Nicholas? 
 What's wrong? 
 Nicholas, are you all right? 
 [Gasping] 
 Baby? 
 I heard a voice... Like a ghost. 
 What are you talking about? 
 He says he wants to be my friend. 
 A ghost? 
 Maybe if he made some real friends, he wouldn't have to invent imaginary ones. 
 Come here, baby. You're okay. 
 Okay. 
 How long are we gonna live like this? 
 Until we know we're safe. 
 How will we know when that is? 
 I mean, if Drill can posses a child... 
 Lena. 
 We know how close he is with Minx. 
 What if... [Sighs] 
 What if he chooses her? 
 That's... that's why we have monitors, sensors all over the house, okay? 
 If he tries to go near Minx or any of us, we'll know. 
 How will knowing stop it from happening? 
 He finally got to sleep. 
 Just took three stories and a children's aspirin. 
 Said he had a headache again. 
 He had one last night, too. 
 Everything he's been through, to only have a headache? 
 Pretty tough kid. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Pretty tough mom, too. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Insects chirping] 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 [Amplified whispering] 
 No! 
 Minx?! 
 No, Drill! Leave me alone! 
 You stay away from her! 
 [Gasps] 
 It's okay, daddy. He's gone now. 
 Okay. What did he want? 
 He said that he'd forgive us for everything we've done if... 
 If I help him make a new friend. 
 Okay, what... what... what friend, honey? 
 Did he... did he say who it is? 
 No. You said not to talk to him anymore. 
 Good. 
 So I didn't. 
 Good. 
 It's okay, baby. You did good. 
 We're just trying to figure out what Drill is up to. 
 I don't know. But whatever it is, it's gonna happen soon. 
 How do you know? 
 Because he said he needed to play with his new friend  now  because... He's running out of time. 
 Claire : Time for what? 
 We don't know. 
 Well, if Drill's looking for a new friend, that means he needs access to someone. 
 Or something. 
 But what? A-a new energy source? 
 Well, we know he tried to call his friends, and we destroyed any possibility of that. 
 So what would he want to do next? 
 It doesn't matter what Drill wants. It's what  we  want. 
 It's this thing out of lives for good. 
 Now, the only way we're gonna do that is to stop reacting to Drill. 
 We need to get a step ahead of him. 
 Okay, but how? 
 The same way we would if we were tracking any other killer... we profile Drill. 
 What are his habits? How does he choose his victims? 
 And what happens when you find him? 
 We all know what it's gonna take to kill Drill. 
 Are we really willing to go that far? 
 Henry : Dad? 
 Yeah? 
 I... I don't feel very good. 
 Is it your head again, sweetheart? 
 No, it's all over. 
 I got it, Claire. I'll take him to the doctor. 
 You guys find the b*st*rd that's been hurting our kids. 
 Okay. How the hell do we do that? 
 We know he feeds on energy. 
 We know he travels through power lines. 
 So there has to be some kind of evidence of that, right? 
 Trail of breadcrumbs telling us where he's been, hopefully where he's going next. 
 Ah, there you are. Good afternoon. Agents, what can I do for you? 
 We're wondering if you've noticed any anomalies in energy consumption over the last few weeks... spikes, dips, anything out of the ordinary. 
 Guess it depends on what you mean by "out of the ordinary." 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Beeping] 
 What are those? 
 Brownouts. 
 They're not uncommon in the summer heat, when, uh, people crank their A.C., but it's been pretty cool lately, so... 
 Can you pull up the addresses? 
 Yeah, sure. Over here. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Beep] 
 There you go. 
 There's a school, playground... 
 Harbor Point nuclear power plant. 
 Bureau office where we interviewed the kids. 
 Wes' house. 
 My house. 
 Capitol University Hospital, last night. 
 [Sighs] This is him, Claire. 
 That one, from this morning... what's this spot? 
 Don't know. It's restricted. 
 One of those government buildings. 
 Usually NSA, D.O.D. 
 Uh-huh. 
 We need to know what's there. 
 Okay, Claire. I... I'll make a few calls. 
 [Beep] 
 Mr. Lawrence. 
 Talk to me, Theo. 
 Okay, so, we looked at the four thermal images that you brought to us. 
 The first image is from 10 days ago, directly after he consumed the energy from the meltdown. 
 Now, the most recent image is from today. 
 Now, these images might look similar to the naked eye, but they're not. 
 From one image to the other, the I.R. Energy is changing. 
 Theo? Layman's terms, please. 
 Uh, your alien has dissipated. 
 It's literally getting less powerful. 
 That's not possible. 
 It's continually eating... lights, power lines, et cetera. 
 Maybe it's different where he's from. 
 But in this planet, in this atmosphere, he's basically chewing celery. 
 I don't understand. 
 It takes more energy to chew celery than the celery can provide, so a human being eating nothing but celery... will starve to death. 
 Hey, Nicholas. 
 Can we ask you a couple of questions? 
 I guess. 
 When you were born, did the whole hospital get stretch marks? 
 [Laughs] 
 Just leave me alone, okay? 
 Please! 
 Okay, let him go. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Electricity crackling] 
 [Screams] 
 Did you see that? Let's get out of here. 
 [Whispering] 
 What did you say your name was? 
 [Whispering] 
 Thank you for saving me, Drill. 
 [Whispering] 
 Okay. 
 [Whispering] 
 How can I help save you? 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 The location you asked about... there's a good reason why it's ghosted on the map. 
 DSN. 
 The deep space network. 
 It's a system of transmission equipment used to track, receive, and send messages to orbiting spacecraft. 
 We destroyed the rock, so Drill, he must be looking for another way to send out the signal. 
 While he still can. 
 When he told Minx that he was "running out of time," this is what he meant. 
 Now, according to my team, Drill is getting weaker every minute of every day. 
 Now, if we can keep him away from DSN or, more importantly, keep him from feeding, them maybe we don't have to kill him, 'cause maybe he'll just die off. 
 Wes... 
 I think I know how we do it. 
 Wes? 
 [Knock on wall] 
 [Sighs] Lena, what's... 
 What's going on? 
 Honey, I think I forgot my sweater upstairs. 
 Would you go check for me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 What's this? 
 I'm scared. 
 If this thing can possess a child... 
 I can't lose her. 
 Not to something like that. 
 If Drill really wants Minx, there's not a place he can't find her. 
 It doesn't matter if he knows where she is if he can't get to her. 
 We're taking a cruise from Baltimore to the Caribbean. 
 If Drill travels through power lines, then... you're taking her where there aren't any. 
 It's a good plan. 
 It's not a good plan. 
 It's a  great  plan. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I don't want you to leave... either of you. 
 Well, we're not  leaving.  We're just taking a vacation. 
 Okay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Smooches] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I couldn't find it, mommy. 
 That's okay, sweetie. Come say goodbye to daddy. 
 Hey. [Smooches] Come here. 
 Now, listen to me. 
 You be a good girl for your mother, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. [Smooches] 
 [Chuckles] Take care. I love you. 
 Bye, daddy. I love you, too. 
 See you soon. Bye. 
 Mwah. 
 Okay, off we go. 
 [Wheels roll] 
 Sean : It started as a headache. 
 Now he's saying he's hurting everywhere. 
 Feels tired, weak. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is a hospital, Sean. 
 Why not just bring him to his pediatrician? 
 I wasn't sure if his unique circumstance was the thing that might be causing any of this, so I thought if anybody understood, it was you. 
 I know what you're thinking about those kids from last night. 
 But Henry's not like that. He's a good boy, Maria. 
 You think he wouldn't do whatever Drill asked to save your life or his mother's? 
 We're all good, Sean, until we have something to lose. 
 Haley : Have you lost your mind? 
 Black out an entire city? 
 Not the whole city, sir. Just the parts that... 
 Do you have any idea of the panic it would cause? 
 Oh, we do, sir. And by all means, we are open to any ideas you have to capture the alien loose in our nation's capitol. 
 Watching the grid, we can identify his signature. 
 The next time he shows himself, we shut the power down grid by grid, block by block. 
 We drive him, funnel him right where we want him. 
 Wes : A secure, abandoned building by the water. 
 A safe zone with no people, no electricity. 
 Yeah, and then what? 
 We starve him out. 
 With no energy to feed on, no way to leave the area... and how long will that take? We can't truly predict... wait, you want to bring Washington to its knees, and you can't even tell me how long it's gonna take? 
 Sir, I don't care how long it takes because if we don't do something today, Drill could bring this country to its knees by tomorrow. 
 The DSN is secure. 
 Even if Drill can access the electrical system, operating the satellites requires security codes that change daily. 
 There's no way he can access... he accessed a secure nuclear facility while were outside, waiting for him to get there. 
 He will find a way, sir. 
 He always does. 
 [Sighs] 
 I... fine, fine. I'll come in early. 
 But tell Bishop he owes me, all right? 
 That's three times this month. 
 And it's always me that gets the call. 
 Why is that? 
 I do have a life, you know. 
 No, I'm not trying to make more of this than it is. 
 Just a schedule's a schedule, right? 
 [Clicking] 
 Yeah, well, tell that to Bishop. 
 Tell him I can't do it tonight. 
 Claire : How's my boy? 
 I'm worried about him. 
 Maria's still examining him. 
 Still? 
 I thought you'd be home by now. 
 Yeah. Hopefully soon. Why? What's wrong? 
 We're blacking out the city, Sean. 
 But to help make sure that Drill doesn't find out, we can't tell the public, so... 
 You know it's gonna be a madhouse out there. 
 Yeah. Get home as soon as possible. 
 Okay, I don't want the two of you out on the streets when this hits. 
 Okay. 
 The school was shut down three years ago, so we got complete control of the campus. 
 Neighbors? 
 Compliant so far. 
 We've evacuated nearly all of them. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 What do you got? 
 All right. 
 These give us what the thermal cameras are showing, and this one's tapped into the city power grid. 
 [Beep] 
 Mr. Secretary, can you hear me? 
 Loud and clear, Wes. 
 Everything is in position. 
 We're just waiting for eyes on the target. 
 Jessup : Any sign? 
 Not yet. 
 Where are you, you son of a bitch? 
 Is that him? 
 It's the same energy draw as the brownouts you isolated before. 
 Looks like a park in Columbia Heights. 
 [Breathes deeply] What do you think? 
 President Winters : You better be damn sure, Mr. Lawrence, before I blind this city. 
 We're sure, Mr. president. 
 Then shut it down. 
 [Beep] 
 [Powering down] 
 Minx : What is it, mommy? 
 It looks like we're delayed an hour. 
 Okay, honey. Why don't we go sit over there? 
 [Indistinct talking over P.A.] 
 [Insects chirping] 
 Drill? 
 Where are you? 
 I brought what you wanted. 
 Look who's back. 
 I'm supposed to meet my friend. 
 Sorry. Your friend ain't coming this time. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause he told me. 
 What? 
 It was pretty cool. 
 He said he couldn't stay here and that you have to follow the lights to find him. 
 He also told me you're all right, and we should give you a chance to show it. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck, Nicholas. 
 
 
 
 Haley : We're getting the first crime reports in now from the blacked-out areas, Agent Bennigan. 
 Well, that's to be expected, sir. 
 Question is, how long do you stand around at the dance till you realize you've been stood up? 
 Maybe you should tell me, sir. 
 My dates always showed. 
 [Sighs] 
 Come on. Where are you? 
 [Horns honking] Man:  We're monitoring the situation as best can. 
 Obviously, the conditions are just horrendous for anyone in Baltimore today. 
 Because of these power outages, traffic... Almost home. Shouldn't be too much longer, okay? Did the doctor tell you what's wrong with me? Uh, we had to leave before the test came back, but I'm sure it's probably nothing to worry about right now, okay, little man? [Siren wails in distance] But what if it's not nothing? What if it's Drill punishing me 'cause I won't play with him anymore? Drill's not gonna hurt you, Henry. In fact, mom is out there right now, making sure that he can't hurt you or anyone else ever again. [Indistinct shouting in distance] Okay. [Sighs] [Electricity crackling] [Tap on shoulder] What? He's here. [Beep] 8th and Jefferson? 8th and Jefferson. Are you sure it's him? There's nothing on the grid at their location. If Henry says it's there, I say we go for it. Claire : If we black out that grid, they'll be stuck right in the middle of it. Sean : Claire, we're gonna be fine. Just do it. [Beeping] Take out grid 8. [Beeping] [Indistinct conversations] [Powering down] [Horns honking] [Indistinct shouting] Man : Of course. No, stay in the car. What's going on? Hey. We're gonna be fine. Okay? It worked. There he is. [Beep] Claire: Look at all those brownouts. It's like he's starting to panic. He must be trying to find a way out. Well, let's give him one. Funnel him straight to us. Take out 5, 6, and 7. [Beeping] [Horn blares] [Tires screech] [Crash] [Engine revs] [Horn honks] Let's go! Back up! [Tires screech] Henry : You did it! Sean : We did it. On our way now. First star on the right? And straight on till morning. [Crash] [Beeping] I'll be damned. It's working. How close is he? Almost home. [Beeping] [Claire sighing] [Camera powers up] Where is this son of a bitch? He's inside the school. He's here. Go dark now. [Powering down] It worked? It seems so. Without any power source, he can't move, right? That's the idea. I think we can assume he's not gonna be too happy about this. Man : I need some help here. [Hazard lights clicking] Woman : You okay? [Indistinct conversation in distance] [Ringing] [Heart beating] [Siren wailing] Henry? Henry? [Seat belt clicks] [Exhales sharply] [Metal creaks] [Grunts] H... Henry? Henry? Henry? Son? Dad? Okay, don't move. I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? [Metal creaking] [Grunts, gasping] Minx : We can't go, mommy. Honey, we've been through this. I don't want to leave daddy here. He's gonna come meet us as soon as he can. Honey, here. Come. Look, I don't like the idea of being away from your dad any more than you do. But... Drill doesn't care about  us.  He's after  you. And we need to keep you as far away from him as possible. Man :  Breaking news... the nation's capitol has been taken down by a mysterious blackout. What's happening? [Sighs] I don't know. We need to find your dad. Claire : Have you heard from Lena? Yeah, she said she'd call me when she gets far enough out to sea. Hopefully, you'll be able to tell her this is all over, she and Minx can come home. Sean and Henry would like that news, too, right? I like him... Sean. He's... he's a good man. Yeah. Yeah, he is. It's funny. I think I had to lose him...  really  lose him... to understand exactly what it was I needed to save. I feel the same way... About Lena. I guess I just forgot who she really was. [Indistinct conversation in distance] There's something there. What? There. You see? Wes, there's a kid inside. How? Drill. He must have lured him. He knew what was happening. He took a hostage. Sir, we need to get the kid out. No, what we need to do is hold our position. I can get to him before anything happens. For all we know, that kid may be part of a trap. I will not allow you or any of my men to take that risk. I need you to stay here, Claire. Wes, I'm going with you. Claire. What the hell are you doing? I ordered you to stand down. I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary. I'm disobeying those orders. Wes, this is insubordination. Yes, it is, sir. Taxi! Oh, come on, Wes. [Busy signal] [Car door closes] Excuse me. Can you get us into D.C.? Sorry, lady. The city's closed. Look, I'll pay you whatever you want. I'd love to take your money, but I'm telling you there's no way in. Man : You guys need a ride? I just dropped my sister off. I'm heading back home. Uh, he said the city's closed. [Chuckles] I know the city inside and out. I can find a way. [Breathing heavily] If we're gonna find that kid... we need to split up. Okay. Keep your coms on. As soon as anything feels off... I'll call in. Okay. [Clang in distance] Wait. Wait! [Panting] Claire, what's happening? I saw him. He was here. [Whispering] We're not here to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. I'm following the kid. Where are you? Uh, somewhere on the second floor, the West side. Okay, I'm coming. Drill. [Electricity crackling] He's here. Drill. He can't move. Claire : Be careful. [Whispering] [Screams, groans] How is he doing that? How is he moving? Man : He must have consumed what little energy was in that thermal monitor. He can't go far. [Breathing heavily] Wes. Nicholas : See, Drill? I told you I could get them here. [Whispering] Henry? [Moans] Be honest. Talk to me. Hey. Dad, my head still hurts. Okay. Hold on. We'll get you out of here, pal. You just stay right there. Put your head right back there. Man : Hey! What are you doing out here? My son, he's stuck. Well, let's get him out. [Indistinct shouting in distance] On 3. 1, 2... [Both grunt] [Metal creaking] Thank you. [Breathing heavily] Henry? Come on, son. Okay. Come on. [Whispering] Stop. Says he doesn't want you coming any closer. Okay. Just tell us what your name is. Nicholas. Nicholas... We have to get out of here. Not until you let Drill out. He's hovering right above him. This is not happening! You're not getting out of here! [Whispering] Wes, he's moving closer. Okay, stop. Just... Just talk to us. Your husband... uh, he's not a fan of cruises? Excuse me? Your wedding ring. Oh. Uh, he had to stay behind to work. What's he do? Wes : Why us? You could get your energy from other stars, other planets. Why come here? [Whispering] He says their future is dying. [Whispering] And they need a new one. But how can we give that to them? [Whispering] He says you don't need to worry about that now. I don't want to do this any more. I want to go home. Okay, Nicholas. Listen to me. Listen to me. Everything is gonna be okay... If you just do exactly what I tell you to do. [Whispering] What is he saying, Nicholas? [Whispering] He says you never tell the children the truth, that things aren't gonna be okay. We're just trying to protect them. [Whispering] He says you don't even listen to us... not like he does. You're too busy playing your own games with each other, too busy to really love us. [Whispering] But Drill loves us. Nicholas, I need you to listen to me now. Drill says you're good at tricking kids. No. No, that's not true. I am just trying to help you, Nicholas. [Whispering] He says you can't even help your own son... [Whispering] that he's the one who gave Henry his hearing back, and that he can make Henry love him again when he tells him what you did, what the two of you did. You stay away from Henry! Drill, my head feels funny. We need to stop this. [Electricity crackles] Wes? [Groans] No! What are you doing?! He's starting the possession, Wes. It's... it's so hot. [Electricity crackling] Aah! It's so hot! It's burning! Please make it stop! Drill, you say you love them, but you don't. You wouldn't do this to someone that you love. I'm burning! I'm burning! Sir, you need to turn the grid back in. He's gonna take the kid. I can't do that, Wes. Do you understand what that means? Burning! It means we end this. Ow! Please, make him stop! Drill, stop it! Mr. President, I know you're seeing this! This is not who we are. We can't do it this way. Sir, we may not get another shot. [Screaming] This is our chance to destroy the enemy. Yes, at what cost? "At what cost?" We make these decisions every day, Wes. As difficult as this sacrifice is, it's ultimately a small price, when you consider... if you think this comes at a small price, you're wrong. Wes, we can't let this happen. I know. Mr. president, before you were commander in chief, you were a father. You are a father. And Nicholas, he has a father... a father who you will have to face and explain why you allowed his son to die. For that father, there will be no solace. So for that, I assure you this is no small price. Let Drill go. Please. Nicholas : Please! Please stop! We will find another way. Open up the grid. Mr. President, I have to advise you... that's an order. [Groaning] [Panting] [Crackling stops] [Sighs] Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. This is not over. You hear me? I will hunt you down. I will destroy you. Mark my words, you will never win! [Electricity crackling] Are you okay? [Sighs] I can't thank you enough. Oh, I'm not gonna take your money. Please. No, y... You needed a helping hand. That's all I offered. Oh. I was worried you were gonna be some crazy killer or something. I'm sorry. Well, I'm happy to allay your fears. Thank you. Bye-bye. Goodnight. Goodnight. Okay. [Sighs] Made it home, buddy. Go turn some lights on. [Sighs] Hey, dad? Yeah? I never got a chance to thank the man who helped us. I told him we'd call in the morning. It just goes to show you, when you need it, people will come to the rescue. Come on. President Winters : You think I made the wrong call? May I be frank, sir? I'd expect nothing less. I don't think you made the wrong call. I  know  you made the wrong call. And now that he knows we're after him, there's no telling what he might do. And that, sir... That is on you. Claire : I'll be home soon. Okay. [Indistinct conversations] They're home safe. Good. [Sighs] How's Nicholas? They think he's gonna be fine. [Siren chirps] [Sighs] [Cellphone ringing] You need to take that. Yeah. Goodnight, Wes. Goodnight, Claire. [Beep] Lena : Wes? Hi, honey. Oh, thank God. I was so worried. You girls far out? No. No, Minx and I, we changed our minds. We're home. Lena, I... [Chuckles] Okay. Come home. Okay, bye.
