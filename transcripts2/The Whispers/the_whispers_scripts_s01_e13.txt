 Previously on "The Whispers"... 
 Drill's been here before, back in 1982. 
 His whole planet was dying. 
 He needed a way to send a signal back to the others. 
 Sean : And your father works with signals. 
 Mr. President, we learned how to kill Drill. 
 He can possess the body of a child. 
 Once he does, he can be destroyed. 
 It's Cassandra! It's the president's daughter! 
 The press conference. This is how he's gonna do it. 
 He's gonna send the signal. 
 [Shrieking violently] 
 Many questions after yesterday's incident at the White House, with the revelation that an extraterrestrial being had taken harbor inside the body... 
 But reports are trickling in that the visitors used the broadcast to send some kind of message. 
 What that mess... 
 Riots erupting all over the world. 
 The real danger is not the possibility of invasion. 
 It's how the fearful public will react to the possibility. Man :  We still haven't heard from the White House on the condition of Cassandra Winters. And while a nation prays for its leader's only child, the biggest question in everyone's mind is... Are we under an alien attack? At this moment, that is the only thing we need to be focused on. We're monitoring activity on every deep-space satellite we have. The international community has reached out with support from their military, as well as scientific... With all due respect, sir, if you're looking for an answer to your question, there's only one person who can give it to you... Drill. He's being transferred to a secure location as we speak. We will use whatever measures are necessary to break him down. And if there is an alien invasion coming, we will find a way to stop it. And what makes you believe he's gonna tell us a damn thing? Because we have to believe in something, sir. [Cellphone vibrating] [Beep] Hey. I've been calling you. Are you all right? Yes. I'm sorry. I tried to stop it, Sean. I'm sorry. I just... I... I couldn't... I know. I know. Just... just come home. I can't. Not yet. I have to talk to her. To  him... And find out exactly what that signal meant. I've been trying to figure that out, too. In 1982, another signal of Drill's was intercepted by a guy who worked for NASA. Thomas Harcourt's father. That's right. Yes. Anything... Anything you can find out. How is Henry? Are... are he and Minx...? They're fine. They're upstairs playing. Claire, I... I need you to promise me something. If it turns out that today... That today is the last day, we need to be a family. I'll be there. I promise. Okay. [Beep] [Breathes deeply] Henry : I'm sorry for what I did to you. I should have believed you when you said you weren't Drill. It's okay. No, it's not. I was a bad friend. Drill was the bad friend. I wish I never met him. Then... Then my mommy would still be alive. I'd give up my hearing to make that come true. I was wondering... Would you teach me some sign language? Sure. What do you want to learn? How do you say... [Sighs] "I hope somebody makes Drill pay for what he's done"? Hello, Claire. What can I do for you? To start... You can leave Cassandra. Spare her life. She was dead the moment I took her. What you see here is nothing more than a suit. A husk. Does that make you feel bad, Claire? You don't get to ask the questions. All right. You go ahead. I have nothing to hide. What you did at the White House, were you sending out a signal? I was. What did the signal mean? I guess you might call it... The beginning. The beginning of what? You already know, Claire. Harper told you what was coming the first time you met. Domination. Sean : Mr. Harcourt, I'm truly sorry about your son. Yes, the... doctor at the hospital, she told me how you tried to save him. I appreciate that. I wish there was more I could do. Well, then we have that in common. Look, I've been watching the news. I figured you'd be calling. So then you heard Drill's signal. I heard more than that, Mr. Bennigan. I heard the answer. You know, there's one thing I haven't heard from you yet. Claire : And what's that? A thank-you. Why the hell would I thank you? Because I saved your husband's life, fixed your son so he could hear again. And still... You treat me like a villain. You corrupted our children. If parents paid more attention to them, I wouldn't have been able to. But they're always alone, watching TV, playing video games. So who's really corrupting the children, Claire? [Door opens] [Door closes] [Footsteps approach] Anything new? Listen, I'm authorized to negotiate with you on behalf of the United States department of defense. You're clearly intelligent. You must know about our military capability. Surely there must be some agreement we can reach to prevent harm coming to both of our people. You both had opportunities to stop this, but you failed because you weren't willing to do one simple thing. And what's that? Sacrifice. If you were willing to sacrifice that boy in the blackout, I would have been trapped there, unable to contact my friends. And... your wife would still be alive. Don't even mention her. Or what? You'll kill me? It would be a shame to miss your friends, especially after you've done all the work. Not quite all the work. There's still one more thing to do. And what might that be? Haven't you listened to a word I've said? If you want to win the game, you must be willing to sacrifice. What's he doing? [Electricity surging] Did he just kill himself? Why would he do that? He wouldn't. Not without a reason. I...Hope... Someone... punishes... Drill... [Whispering] [Whispering] [Whispering] That was Sean. He's with Ron Harcourt. Apparently Drill's friends... They answered. What do you mean, "answered"? They sent a message like the one he heard in '82. He thinks that maybe, if he can translate it, h-he can send one back to them and try and... Okay, I'll... I'll... I'll alert the Pentagon. You have him call me the second he gets something. I will. I'm headed home now. H-honey, have you seen my glass of... there it is. [Rattling] Woman : Nicholas. Nicholas, open this door. Nicholas? Are you out there? Nicholas, let me out! Jessup : Where are you going with that? Conference room. They're coordinating with the national guard. Uh, when you're done, I want to send some units out to check on some families. These are the kids that were picked up in that round-up. Jessup? Tam, what are you doing here? I just... I wanted to see you. Uh, I'll get you that list in a minute. [Indistinct conversations] Now is not really the best time... I know. How's, uh...? Oh, it's... Not too bad. I never thought I'd be having a... Me neither. Listen, I... I thought maybe we could talk. [Siren wails in distance] I know. And I have no business even coming here, but if this is it, if this is the end... Tam. Then I want to spend it with you. I got a job to do. For once in your life, Jessup, just forget about your job. Come with me. Be with me. [Horns honking] Woman : Let me go! [Indistinct shouting] Excuse me. Would you mind just w-watching the car for a second? Sure. Thank you. Did you see three kids just walk through here... Claire Bennigan? Yes? Mother of Henry Bennigan. Yes. I think it's safe to assume any attack would come from the sky. So... so the fact that the... The last rock we found was buried under the Sahara desert doesn't mean anything? Wes, we know it crashed when it collided mid-flight with Sean Bennigan's plane. Okay, that doesn't mean there's not other things out there. We know that there were other visitors in 1982. How did they get here? Where... where... Where's  their  rock? All I'm saying is that any choice we make now will be purely based on assumption. And what are you always saying? You can't fight an enemy if you don't know what they want. Well, that's what you were supposed to find out before the only person who could tell us blew himself to smithereens. There may be another choice. We just need to give them time. Give  who  time? At NASA, when we heard sounds from space... [  Shrieking ] They would get translated into a series of codes. Mostly numbers or letters that look something like this. That's the signal I picked up just before Drill arrived in 1982. And this from yesterday... [  Shrieking ] Which was translated by the computer as  this  series of numbers... 111215, 111215, over and over. I know that number. Hmm? I know that number. These tattoos... I have them everywhere. They mean something. Or meant something to Drill. Do you think that we could use these a-as a Rosetta stone to figure out a language? Henry : Dad? There's a strange lady staring at our house. [Chuckles] Hello. Can I help you? Perhaps. Are you Sean Bennigan? I am. The father of Henry Bennigan? You want to tell me what this is about? [Chuckles] [Scuffling] [Grunting] Are we ready? Hey, Claire. It's... it's... It's me again. Uh, just wondering where you guys are with the... With the message. The natives are getting restless over here, understandably. I'll... I'll try you on the home phone. [Beeping] [Ringing] [Sighs] Where the hell are you, Claire? [Inhales deeply] [Panting] Oh... Sean. Sean. Sean. Hen... where's Henry? Where's Henry? I know. I know. I know. I don't know. I... Where are we? [Breathing heavily] [Metal rattling] Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Bennigan. Who the hell are you people? Just think of us as friends. Look, I don't know what you want from us... It's not about what  we  want, Mrs. Bennigan. Just sit tight. It'll all be over soon. Our son? Where is he? We just need to know he's okay. Henry is fine. [Breathes deeply] All the children... Are fine. [Thunder rumbles] Harper, I understand you were a tremendous help with our friend. Drill and I helped each other. That's what it's all about, isn't it... Helping each other. Just like you helped me today. [Chuckling] Correct. And while it doesn't seem like your parents understand... Someday they will. [Horn honks] This is how I'm supposed to get there. So, where should we go? I don't care. As long as I'm with you. What is it? That girl... I know her. Hey, Harper. Do you remember me? I work with Claire Bennigan. We spoke with you about Drill. I was wondering... Hi. I'm agent Jessup Rollins. How do you know little Harper here? I'm just a friend of the family's. Is that right, Harper? She's just a friend of the family. I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Mrs. Hollander. Mrs. Hollander. Nice to meet you. Good to see you again, Harper. Take care of yourself, all right? What was that all about? That's exactly what I was wondering. Okay, I just need to call my partner, okay, and then... Oh, Jessup. I wish you hadn't seen that girl. So, you're gonna kill us? I don't believe so. Then why are we here? Because that's what Drill wanted. We all have a part to play, Mrs. Bennigan. And if we're patient, we all eventually find out what it is. What else did Drill want? Just for everything to go smoothly. You mean for the invasion. Was it called an "invasion" when the pilgrims came to the new world? Or was it called "progress"? An effort to teach the savage natives a better way of life. Did Drill tell you that? When? Before or after they picked up bits of him off the floor? [Chuckles] Drill said you'd try to get under our skin. Drill only talks to children. How do you... Because Drill doesn't just discard his friends, Mr. Bennigan. He doesn't move them aside when someone more useful comes along. Once Drill makes you his friend, you're his friend for life. You didn't meet Drill recently, did you? You met him when you were just a girl. We forget the things that made us happy when we were a child. We lock them away in our brain to make you... Make way for love and work and other grown-up things. Sometimes... All it takes is a little something to jog your memory, and it all comes flooding back. [Footsteps approach] [Chains rattle] Drill's death... What? It was just a trigger. That's why he did it. These people, they're like some kind of... Sleeper cell. 
 
 Wes : Claire? Hello? [Knock on door] Claire? Sean? [  Shriek repeating ] Minx? I think you need to see this. This feed is showing the view from the S.O.R. telescope at Kirtland. What's happening? Those stars... Are they moving? Those aren't stars, sir. They're coming. [Breathing heavily] Would you at least tell me your name? Oh, our names don't matter, Mrs. Bennigan, any more than yours do. Is that why all the visitors are called Drill? Perhaps. Or maybe it's because, to them, no one matters. Everyone is interchangeable, a means to an end. Do you know what the end looks like? That will be enough. Thomas Harcourt, he met Drill in 1982. I'm guessing that's... That's right around the time that you met him. He found out what the end looks like... Just a few days ago, when he wouldn't tell Drill what he wanted to know. You think we don't know about Thomas? All Drill's friends... We're connected. We all have our part to play in the coming. Oh, my God. How many of those are there? There's no way to know. This is just one satellite. Where the hell is Wes Lawrence? Wes : Minx? Minx? Henry? Minx? Minx? Baby? [Grunts] [Panting] [Cellphone ringing] Jessup : Hello? Can you hear me? Jessup? Hey. Uh, I'm in trouble here. Yeah, I think we all are. Where are you? I'm in a trunk. I think it's mine. Okay. Just... Just hang in there, okay? Have you seen Sean and Claire? No. What the hell is going on? Okay, that's what I... I'm trying to figure out. Just keep your phone on you. I'll track you. Hopefully, wherever you're going, they'll be there too. [Horn honks] Where do you think you're going? Well, this is where I'm supposed to be. Sorry. This area's closed. Where are your parents? They're where they can't cause any more trouble. [Beep] I need... I need a TAC team out on Walnut and Layton. Just get them to me now, okay? [Beep] Woman :  We're getting reports of various missing persons. If you recognize any of the people shown here, please call your local police department. Tonight, we continue to ask the public to stay home and remain calm. [Indistinct conversation] With curfew in effect, the phone lines at police stations across the country are already being overwhelmed. And now there is a new development. We're getting reports of various missing persons. If you recognize any of the people shown here, please call your local police department. Tonight, we continue to ask the public to stay home and remain calm. [TV chatter continues] [Camera shutter clicks] [Indistinct conversations] Still waiting on confirmation from a government official, but reports are trickling out that the visitor used the broadcast to send some kind of message to its people. What that message was, no one seems to know. But we've learned that... Hey. Uh, we could really use some water. I'm afraid that's not possible. Drill said you weren't to be trusted. [Metal rattling] [Sighs] [Indistinct whispering] Yes, I believe the red-haired boy belongs to them. Did something happen to my son? My son. Nobody move! Wait! Wait! Wes, don't! What are you talking about? She won't shoot me. Either your gun goes down or he does. Jessup... Wes, don't. Tam, why are you doing this? Because when I was a kid, I believed Drill was here to help us. I still do. [Gunshot] [Gasps] What was that? Sean! You think this is just about you and your child? No, I know... I know it's much bigger than that. Good, then you'll understand if I have to... No! [Gunshot] [Sirens wailing in distance] [Gasps] Jessup. Are you okay? Yeah. Thank you. They're all gone. There was... there was equipment here, uh, papers. What about kids? W-were there any kids here? No. Just adults. Ron Harcourt? I'm sorry. Ron's dead. I found him at your place. That was the bureau. They got Henry. What? How? I don't know. But he's safe. Police brought him in when they found out who he was. And... and Minx? I haven't heard anything. Sorry. Man :  We break in for this live update. Woman :  According to a source inside the Pentagon, there has indeed been visual confirmation of the visitors. So it seems that their arrival is not a question of if, but when. They're here. Sir, we're getting reports from other cities experiencing the same blue lights. Other cities? New York, London... Paris, Bordeaux, Seville, Marbella... Tindouf. How did you know? Because Drill led me there to all of them. Well, what if, I... In all these... Henry! Hey. You okay? Henry? Are you okay? Does he know where Minx is? Henry... Where is Minx? Don't worry. She's where she needs to be. Do you know what you're supposed to do, child? You don't have to be afraid. I'm not. We all have a part to play. This is mine. And you remember where to go? Drill made sure I wouldn't forget. [Wind howling] Frommer : The president has authorized the use of extreme measures. How would you classify "extreme"? We're gonna detonate warheads in space, enough to generate an E.M.P. field in the flight path of the visitors. Your associates used that technique down here to destroy the rock. Hopefully we'll have the same success up there. A pulse of that magnitude would take out our entire security grid. I'm aware of the risks. We're out of options. Maybe not, sir. Look, let me work on something. I'll get back to you. [Beep] How long do we wait? We don't. Initiate the launch. Ron Harcourt thought there might be a message inside the signal? Yeah, something that would have been important to Drill. Okay, and the kids, they can hear him. So we don't need Drill to translate the message. What we need is... A child. Man :  Warheads have reached the outer atmosphere. Targets are in sight. Impact imminent. [  Shrieking ] Claire : Henry, can you tell us what this message is saying? Henry. He's still not answering. It's like he's under some kind of spell. 3... 2... 1. Contact. Repeat... contact. It looks like a direct hit, sir. What's happening? [Explosions in distance] [Indistinct conversations] It must have worked. What worked? The warhead, they... we did it. [Siren wailing in distance] Henry? Henry, is it over? Are they gone? Henry. Henry. Can you hear me? [Voice breaking] Henry? Please... Look at me. Look at me. I know you can hear me. I know you're in there somewhere. No matter what happens, I will always love you. [Breathing shakily] Always. To the moon and back. Henry. Henry. Look at my hands. Can you hear me? Tell me... What does the message... In that signal mean? What's it trying to tell us? What's he saying? He's saying... The message is a question. "Are the children ready?" What does that mean? It means we got it wrong. They're not here for our planet. [Sniffles] They're here for our children. If they're here to take our children, the question is, where are they taking them from? A gathering of 100 kids shouldn't be too hard to find. Y-you're assuming that they're gonna be together. No. Wait. There was a map at the compound. I took a picture of it. Here. Let me. [Beeping] Can you tell what they're marking? No. I can't blow the image up any further... it breaks apart. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, look. Count up the marks. I bet there's one for each kid. That's where they're headed. They're waiting there to be... We need every available agent now. I'll call, but it is a madhouse out there. Look, I... I don't care about monuments or about businesses. These are our children. Do you know which one of those spots is for Minx? Do you think you can take us there? We don't have much time. Sean : There's a few places marked in these woods, it's hard to tell exactly where from the photo. Okay. We should split up. Take this. I'll call if I see her. I will too. Okay. We'll go this way. Come on. [Exhales shakily] Minx! Minx?! Minx, it's daddy! I'm... I'm here for you, sweetheart! Sean : Minx! Minx? Minx?! [Twig snaps] Minx? Minx! Claire : Anything? No. Minx! Minx?! Sean, wait! Are you sure? Keep going. She's just up ahead. Over that ridge. I don't see her! She's... she's not over here! Henry, what are you doing? I'm sorry, mommy. Oh, no. [Gasps] Minx! Minx? Claire : Sean! No! No! Dad? [Panting] Henry. [Panting] What happened? Where's mommy? It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Woman :  In the aftermath of the aliens' departure... Man :  Blink of an eye, thousands were taken by the visitors. Woman :  From the United States, Europe, and as far away as Africa, all under the same circumstances. Reports of the missing continue to trickle in. Man :  And while the world mourns, we're left with only one question... Where are our children?
