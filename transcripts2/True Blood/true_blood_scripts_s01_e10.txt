 Scene 1: At Bill's house - Sookie, Sam 
 Sookie and Sam are screaming. He's at Dean's place, on the bed. 
 Sookie (shouting):  What the hell are you doing here? 
 Sam:  Nothing. Sleeping. 
 Sookie:  Did you touch me? 
 Sam:  Hell no, I swear. Sookie, listen. Bill asked me to look after you while he was away. 
 Sookie:  Did he ask you to do it buck-naked? 
 Sam:  No, no. 
 Sookie:  I want you out of here. Now. 
 Sam:  Listen, listen, Sookie. I need to tell you something about me, something I've never told another person. 
 Sookie:  Oh, my God, it's you. You're the murderer. 
 Sam:  No, no, Sookie... 
 Sookie:  Oh, my God, you killed my grandmother. 
 He tries to touch her and clam her but she hit him and run away, to the bathroom. She closes the door behind her and hinds in the shower. The door is open. Sookie sees Dean behind it. Dean becomes Sam. Sookie is stunned. 
 Sam:  I'm not the killer, I swear. I'm a shape-shifter. 
 Sookie:  Shut the f*** up.

 Scene 2: In the woods - Miss Jeanette, Tara 
 Tara and Miss Jeanette are on the ground in the woods, and Miss Jeanette prepares her stuff for the exorcism. 
 Tara:  What's that for? 
 Miss Jeanette:  Give me your hand. 
 Tara:  Why? 
 Miss Jeanette:  "Why, why, why? Why's it have to be in the woods? Why's it have to be before dawn? Why 799.95? Why, why, why?" You think knowing the answers will save you? Shut up and give me your hand. 
 Miss Jeanette spit in Tara's hand. 
 Tara:  You nasty b****. 
 Miss Jeanette:  That's cleaner than anything you've ever touched. Hold it on the fire. Keep it there. Angelica root and spit. A lot stronger than holy water. You got poison oozing out your pores. You live near a highway? 
 Tara:  No. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Cook with a microwave or talk on a cell phone? 
 Tara:  Who doesn't? 
 Miss Jeanette:  I don't. All that pollution and technology, that's how demons travel. That's why I stay away out here in the woods, away from civilization. Rub it on you face. 
 Tara:  Are you serious? 
 Miss Jeanette:  You make sure to get around you eyes. That's the demon's doorways. 
 Tara rubs on her face the potion she has in her hands.  Miss Jeanette gives  her a small bottle. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Drink. 
 Tara begins to drink. 
 Tara:  Jesus, what the hell is it? 
 Miss Jeanette:  Snake juice. 
 Tara:  It's made from snakes? 
 Miss Jeanette:  No. it snakes down in you, coils around that evil and rapes it out. All of it. Every last drop. 
 Tara continues to drink. 
 Scene 3: Jason's basement - Amy, Eddie 
 Amy takes blood from Eddie. 
 Eddie (asleep):  Jason? 
 Amy:  If I were you, I'd get my filthy mind off of him. What is it that you vampires say? "Jason is mine." 
 Eddie:  It's not like that. He's a good person. 
 Amy:  Are you implying that I'm not? 
 Eddie:  Well Jason isn't planning to kill me after I'm no longer any use to him. 
 Amy:  Sophomore year of college, I walked away from an academic scholarship so I could go to this Guatemalan village, help build their first irrigation system so they could have fresh water, crops that didn't give them dysentery. So don't you dare get morally superior on me. I am an organic vegan, and my carbon footprint is miniscule. Because I know that, ultimately, we're all just a single living being. But you are not. 
 She beats him on the shoulder. 
 Eddie:  What the hell? 
 Amy:  You got a clop forming. 
 She beats him again. Eddie shouts.  
 Amy:  Here. Okay, I need tape to keep it at that angle. 
 She opens a drawer and finds empty bottles of Tru Blood. 
 Amy:  Jason, Jason, Jason. 
 Eddie:  I was half dead. He only tried to help. 
 Amy:  He shouldn't told me about this. Why wouldn't he tell me about this? 
 Eddie:  I won't tell him if you won't. 
 Amy:  Withholding is tantamount to lying, and I can't have that in our relationship. This is so beneath us. 
 Eddie:  Jason lives you. He never cared about anyone before. He even thinks that you might be the one. 
 Amy:  You talk about me with him? And he said that? He said that he thinks that I might be the one? 
 Eddie:  Amy, if I die here, Jason will never forgive you even if he wanted to. He's not as evolved as you are. 
 Amy:  I know. 
 Scene 4: Outside Bill's house - Sookie, Sam 
 Sookie:  A shape-shifter? 
 Sam:  Most of us refer to ourselves simply as shifters. 
 Sookie:  Well, how many of you are there? 
 Sam:  Thousands, tend of thousands, maybe. We don't exactly have a newsletter. 
 Sookie:  Do you come from, like, a family of shifters or something? 
 Sam:  It's hereditary, so yeah, I suppose. But... I was adopted. And the family that took me in... we just never talked about it. 
 Sookie:  Can you turn into anything, like cats, birds? 
 Sam:  Cats, sure. Yeah, I can do bird, but flying's hard. Dog's the easiest for me. People like dogs. Most other animals leave you alone. 
 Sookie:  I used to scratch your belly in the parking lot at the bar. 
 Sam:  That wasn't me, that was a real dog. I need a live animal in order to shift. You know, as a model. Kind like an imprint. 
 Sookie:  Can you turn into another person? 
 Sam:  Humans are too complex. Despite what you might see at the bar. 
 Sookie:  Can you do it any time, or what? 
 Sam:  Yeah. Yeah, but it wears off if I fall asleep. And on a full moon, I can't stop the shift. 
 Sookie:  Like a werewolf. 
 Sam:  We're not werewolves. Hey, werewolves are dangerous, nasty creatures. Do not call me a werewolf. 
 Sookie:  Werewolves exist too? What else is there? 
 Sam:  More than you could imagine. 
 Sookie goes and seats on the stairs. Sam follows her. 
 Sookie:  I can't... Life is getting too weird, too fast. Could a werewolf have killed Gran? 
 Sam:  I suppose it's possible. 
 Sookie:  Oh, my God. Bill's been dragged off by vampires and now I find out you're something I never even knew existed. (She cries. Sam seats beside her and put his hand on her shoulder) Don't! 
 Sam:  I thought you would understand. 
 Sookie (shouting):  Why? Because I'm dating a vampire? 
 Sam:  You know what' it's like to live with a secret. 
 Sookie:  I don't hide who I am. 
 She goes in front of the door. 
 Sam (shouting):  I wanted to tell you for years. 
 Sookie (shouting):  I kissed you. And I know you wanted to do more than that. Were you gonna tell me before or after? 
 She enters in the house.  
 Scene 5: In the woods - Tara, Miss Jeanette 
 Miss Jeanette:  Spit, smoke, root. Cleanse the body. Cleanse the soul. Snake, seek, search, find. Bring it to the light. The light. 
 Tara:  F***, my stomach. 
 Miss Jeanette:  It's angry. It's digging its claws so it can hold on. Don't you fight back. Let your body be the battleground. You let that demon destroy itself. 
 Tara:  I feel sock. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Let it go, let it go. Let it go. Let go of all that sickness, all that rage, all that anger, all that hate, all that self-pity. It's just fuel for the demon inside of you. 
 Tara:  F***. 
 Tara vomits. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Come forth, demon. Leave this child in peace. Come into the light. Show yourself. 
 Tara sees a small girl in the woods. 
 Tara:  That ain't real. 
 Miss Jeanette:  What's there? Tell me what you see. 
 Tara:  It's me standing right over there. It's me. 
 Miss Jeanette:  The demon will take on any form to stay alive. It knows your weaknesses. It preys on your fears. (She gives Tara a dagger) Only you can destroy it. 
 Tara gets up and goes to the girl. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Don't let it fool you, Tara Mae. You stand up to that demon. 
 Little Tara (to Tara):  No, Mama, please, don't hurt me. 
 Miss Jeanette (to Tara):  One of you must die. 
 Tara kills little Tara with the dagger. Little Tara disappears. Tara sees blood on the dagger. She cries.  
 Miss Jeanette (coming to her):  Good girl. Good girl, good girl. Good girl. It's all over now. That demon is gone forever. 
 Scene 6: In Jason's bathroom - Jason, Amy 
 Jason is in the bathroom, looking in the mirror when Amy comes. 
 Amy:  You spend more time on your hair than any man I've ever met. 
 Jason:  The trick is to make it look like you didn't do nothing. It's harder than it might seem. 
 Amy:  I don't think you need any help looking good, you know it. 
 Jason:  I think I might have had one too many beers last night. I feel like I been shot at and missed, sh1t at and hit. 
 Amy sits on the cabinet. 
 Amy:  We need to talk about Eddie. 
 Jason:  Okay. 
 Amy:  Well, I've been thinking. The way that we've been treating him, it's just really uncivilized, you know? 
 Jason:  Yeah. I do know. 
 Amy:  We can't let him go, of course but we can try to make things just a little bit more comfortable for him. Do you know what Stockholm syndrome is? 
 Jason:  It's a disease. 
 Amy:  Not exactly. It's something that happens to people who are kidnapped. It's like, over time, they start to get closer to their kidnappers. It's kind of like being part of a family. 
 Jason:  Really? 
 Amy:  All we need to do is make Eddie love us. And he already loves you. And eventually, we wouldn't have to keep him locked up. He could just be in the house with us like he's... 
 Jason:  Like a pet. 
 Amy:  Yeah. And we could travel with him. 
 Jason:  Yeah. 
 Amy:  We could sell his blood when we need money. And just live out of backpacks and see the whole world. We just need boots and a map. 
 Jason:  I ain't never seen snow. 
 Amy:  Tibet. We can climb the Himalayas. We can visit the Dalai Lama. 
 Jason:  And snowboard naked. 
 Amy:  Right, I gotta go to the store. I wanna get Eddie some Tru Bloods. 
 Jason:  Really? 
 She kisses him. 
 Amy:  I love you. 
 He kisses her.  
 Jason:  I love you too. 
 Amy:  I love you more. 
 She leaves.  
 Jason (looking in the mirror):  Oh, my God. You are even better looking than you were yesterday. 
 Scene 7:  At Tara's house - Tara, Letti Mae 
 Letti Mae is sleeping on the sofa when Tara comes home. 
 Tara:  Mama. Mama, wake up. 
 Letti Mae:  Baby, where you been? I've been so worried. 
 Tara:  I had the exorcism. 
 Letti Mae:  Tara, are you...? 
 Tara:  It worked, Mama. It worked. 
 Letti Mae:  Jesus answered my prayers. We're saved. 
 They hug.  
 Letti Mae:  Both if us, saved. You did a brave thing, Tara Mae. I am so proud of you, my baby. 
 Tara:  My whole life, I thought you didn't... I thought... 
 Letti Mae:  I forgive you. 
 Tara:  get dressed. I'm taking you out to celebrate. 
 Letti Mae:  Anywhere you wanna go. How about Mamaw's Mudbugs over in Keachi? That too far to drive to? 
 Tara:  Are you kidding? I'd drive anywhere for you. 
 Scene 8: Outside the Merlotte's - Sam, Sookie, Terry, Arlene 
 Sam is putting the lanterns. 
 Sam (to Sookie):  Sookie, could you reach me up another box of lanterns? 
 Sookie:  I'm kind of busy right now setting up your bar. (To Terry) Thank you, Terry. You are so sweet and reliable. I always know what to expect from you. No nasty surprises. 
 Terry:  That's just because you don't know me very well. 
 Arlene arrives. 
 Arlene (to Sam):  Oh, Sam. These lanterns are just precious. But they ought to alternate colors. Like boy-girl seating. 
 Sam:  But they're already in place. 
 Arlene:  Oh, it won't tale a minute to change. 
 Sam:  All right, Arlene. 
 Arlene:  Don't you think they should hang in little scallops, like a gingerbread house? It'll be more romantic that way, not like some hick barn dance. 
 Sam:  What do you want it to look like? 
 Terry:  A debutante ball. 
 Arlene:  Hug your neck. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I'll be right back. Thank you, Sam. 
 She goes in. 
 Sam:  How did you know what she wanted? 
 Terry:  My cousin Portia was a deb in Shreveport when she turned 18. Every Bellefleur woman's been doing it since they started having them before the revolutionary War. 
 Sam:  It must be nice to come from such an old family. 
 Terry:  All families are old, Sam. Some just keep better records. 
 Flash back: 
 Sam is on the sofa, in his house, and there's a dog barking.  
 Sam's mother:  Sam, hush that dog up. What are you doing to get him so riled up? 
 Sam is shaking, he falls down on the floor. 
 Mother:  Mitch, there's something wrong with Sam. 
 Sam runs to the kitchen, then goes out, remove his shirt. 
 Mother:  Lord in heaven. 
 He becomes a dog, in front of his parents, and leaves. 
 End flash back. 
 Arlene:  Sam. Sam. Don't put the red ones next to the green ones. This ain't Christmas. (She begins to go. To everyone) Hey, get that dog out of here. 
 Scene 9: Lafayette's house - Lafayette 
 Actress (tv):  Don't shut me out, please. 
 Lafayette:  Georgia, your replacement just showed up. (With an other actress) Thought you said you were gonna get rid of her quick. 
 Actor (tv):  B****, I love you, you scandalous w****. 
 Lafayette:  Take you man. Take his ass. 
 Actress:  ... and company. 
 Lafayette sees from the window the senator coming 
 Actor:  Shut up. Shut up and get upstairs. 
 Lafayette:  You better walk down them stairs like: (he walks how she should do it). 
 Lafayette goes to open the door. 
 Actress:  Oh, I forgot to tell you, Georgia. I saw the picture... 
 Lafayette opens the door. 
 Lafayette:  Well, this as unexpected pleasure. 
 Senator:  Hey. 
 Lafayette:  Hey. 
 The senator comes in.  
 Senator:  I can't stay long. 
 Lafayette:  Boyfriend, I can make you stay longer than you ever thought you could. 
 Senator:  Actually, I had something else in mind. 
 Lafayette:  What? 
 The senator gives him money. 
 Senator:  A little V-juice? 
 Lafayette doesn't take it.  
 Lafayette:  Sold out. (he lies on the sofa) What? AIn't nothing I can do. My supplier only comes out after dark, if you know what I mean. 
 Senator:  Damn it. I have a speech tonight. 
 Lafayette:  You got the stage fright? 
 Senator:  yeah. 
 Lafayette goes near him.  
 Lafayette:  I could help you with that. (He takes the money) You know I can. 
 Senator:  I can't mess up my clothes. 
 Scene 10: In Tara's car - Tara, Letti Mae 
 Letti Mae is eating and Tara drinking. 
 Tara:  I love how Mamaw's Mudbugs is exactly the same as when we used to go there when I was little. Remember? 
 Letti Mae:  Yeah, until I lost my license. First thing in the morning, I'm going down to DMV. 
 Tara:   What's wrong? 
 Letti Mae:  I don't know. Maybe one bucket was enough. 
 Tara:  I told you not to suck the heads. 
 Letti Mae:  Oh, good Lord in heaven. 
 Tara:  Hold on. I'll find us a drug store get you some Pepto. 
 Scene 11: At a drug store - Tara, Miss Jeanette 
 Tara arrives and asks someone who works there for help. 
 Tara:  Excuse me. What aisle's the Pepto-Bismol on? 
 Woman working:  Aisle 7. Right over there. 
 Tara:  I know you. 
 Woman:  No, I'm sure you've mistaken me for someone else. 
 The woman begins to go but Tara follows her. 
 Tara:  Miss Jeanette. 
 Woman:  No. I'm needed up front, ma'am. 
 Tara:  No, I know your face. Don't run away from me. 
 Tara catches her and removes her wig.  
 Woman/Miss Jeanette:  Hey! 
 Tara:  You took advantage of my mama. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Don't touch me. 
 Tara:  Don't touch you? I ought to kill you, b****. 
 Miss Jeanette:  I will call the police. 
 Tara:  Go ahead. Tell them how you charged me 800$ to spit in my face and poison me. You know what? I'll call them myself. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Wait, wait. 
 Tara:  What was in that sh1t you gave me, that snake juice? 
 Miss Jeanette:  Ipecac syrup and a small amount of peyote. It's perfectly safe. 
 Tara:  I puked my guts out. I hallucinated stabbing a little girl. What the f*** of person are you? 
 Miss Jeanette:  Look. I got a son in prison, another one in Iraq. I got a daughter with diabetes, and three grandbabies I gotta take care of. I do what I have to for my family. Same as you. 
 Tara:  I actually believed you had fixed me. Oh, my God, I am such a f*cking dumb-ass. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Listen. Just because Miss Jeanette ain't real doesn't mean she can't help people. You saw how it worked for your mama. She still sober? 
 Tara:  Once she finds out about you, she'll be drinking again. 
 Miss Jeanette:  Well, maybe she don't have to find out. Faith's a powerful thing. 
 Tara leaves. 
 Tara:  F***, f***, f***. 
 Tara joins her mum in the car.  
 Letti Mae:  You get something for me? 
 Tara:  They're out. 
 
 
 
 Scene 12: Outside the Merlotte's 
 Arlene and Rene are dancing. Sookie is alone, on a chair, drinking when Terry comes.  
 Terry:  I'd ask you to dance, but I don't dance. 
 Sookie:  Thanks anyhow, Terry. Sometimes, crowds makes me feel guilty for not having fun like everyone else. And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty. 
 Terry:  Guilt is a useless emotion. Or so I've heard. 
 Sookie:  I just wish Bill was here. 
 Sookie:  There's some dead people I wish was still around too. 
 Scene 13: At the vampire tribunal -the Magister, Bill, Eric, 
 Luisa, a vampire, removes one fang from the vampire.  
 Magister:  I****. You fed on a human that belonged to another. Three months of starving till your fangs grow back will teach you better manners. Brothers and sisters of the tribunal, is this fair? Is this just? 
 The vampires:  Yeah. 
 Magister:  Now, Luisa, the other one, please. From the root. 
 She removes the other fang.  
 Magister:  Sentence passed and executed. The trial is concluded. Best of luck. Moving on. This looks interesting. Eric Northman, sheriff of Area 5. 
 Eric:  Magister. 
 Magister:  Well, then. Bring me your murderer. 
 Scene 14: Jason's basement - Jason, Eddie, Amy 
 Jason helps Eddie to drink Tru Blood. 
 Jason:  It's nice not to have sneak it to you no more, ain't it? 
 Eddie:  Yeah, it is surprising. 
 Jason:  See? I told you Amy wasn't a psycho. The more time you spend with us, you'll see she's an amazing woman. 
 Eddie:  What made her change her mind? 
 Jason:  Well, she wants you to live with us, like a part of the family. I do too. 
 Eddie:  She tell you about finding the Tru Bloods you brought me? 
 Jason:  You're lying. Well, what did she say? 
 Eddie:  She said that withholding was tantamount to lying and that your relationship was better than that. 
 Jason:  F***. God, that even sounds like her. 
 Eddie:  She's playing you, Jason. 
 Jason:  No, she is not. Ain't nobody plays Jason Stackhouse. 
 Eddie:  If you don't let me go, she's going to kill me. 
 Jason:  She would never do that. She's a... 
 Eddie:  Psychopath? 
 Amy's voice:  Jason, we're late. 
 Jason:  Yeah, I'm coming. 
 Amy comes down. 
 Amy:  Bye-bye, Eddie. We'll see you in a few hours. I was thinking we could bring one of the TVs down here. Does that sound good? (To Jason) Come on. 
 She leaves. 
 Jason:  You're wrong about her. 
 Jason leaves. Eddie's phone rings.  
 Scene 15: At Eddie's house- Lafayette 
 Lafayette (on the cell):  Eddie, where you at? I'm at your crib. The door was wide open. This is f***** up as f***. Call me when you get this message, b****. (He closes his phone) Jason F****** Stackhouse, you bigmouth motherf*****. 
 Scene 16: Outside the Merlotte's, at Arlene and Rene's party 
 Arlene and Rene are dancing. 
 Arlene:  Honey, let me set a spell. I'm sweating all over this dress. 
 Rene:  What, you won't dance with me? That's a fine thing at your own fais do-do. 
 Arlene:  Go ask Sookie to dance. The poor thing's got nobody here. Everyone's afraid of her. Go on. 
 Sookie is alone, and Rene goes to her.  
 Rene:  You look lonely as a cloud. Ain't right. 
 Sookie:  Why, thank you, Rene. Arlene is a lucky lady. 
 They dance. 
 Rene:  Not everyone likes a coonass like me. 
 Sookie:  I do. So does Bill. 
 Rene:  I don't have nothing against vampires, you know that. But you're a good girl, Sookie. I think you deserve better. 
 Sam:  Mind if I cut in? 
 Rene gives Sookie to Sam and leaves. Sookie and Sam dance.  
 Sam:  Okay, truce? It's not fair you being mad about something I can't help. 
 Sookie:  I'm mad that you didn't trust me enough to tell me. You hid the most important thing about yourself. 
 Sam:  So what? You're with Bill now. 
 Sookie:  Yeah, and you're with Tara. Another thing you didn't tell me. 
 Sam:  There's nothing to tell about. 
 Sookie:  Oh, does she know that? Or the fact that you can turn yourself into a dog? 
 Sam:  It's none of her business. And you know what, I didn't tell you because I knew this is how you'd react. But you're right. I didn't trust you. I trusted my instincts, and they were dead-on. 
 He leaves.  
 Jason and his friends are talking and laughing when Amy comes. 
 Amy:  I think I'll get another beer. Do you guys..? You want one? 
 Hoyt:  Oh, no. 
 Amy:  Babe? 
 Jason:  Oh, no. I'm fine. 
 She leaves. 
 Hoyt:  I think she's my favorite girl you ever dated. Where'd you meet her at? 
 Jason:  It's kind of embarrassing. Fangtasia. 
 Rene:  What? The f*** you doing there? 
 Hoyt:  The vampire bar? 
 Jason:  The only reason I went there was because there was this band playing that I like. 
 Rene:  You one brave motherf***** going there to see them play. 
 Jason:  It's just a bunch of losers wearing black. Amy and I could tell y looking at each other we didn't belong there. The one thing sort of led to another. Never did see the band. 
 Hoyt:  Oh, Gid, I wanna be you. 
 Rene:  So this is it? She the one who's gonna take Jason Stackhouse off the market for good? 
 Jason:  I don't know. 
 Rene:  Now, what you waiting for? Life is short. You find a good one, you keep her. 
 Jason:  You're right. I never felt this way about any girl before. I think that's maybe why... (lower) I think I lost the upper hand in the relationship, you know? 
 Hoyt:  That sucks. 
 Rene:  What sucks? You take it back. 
 Jason:  Take it back? 
 Rene:  Take it back. You say "Woman, this is what I want. This is the way it's gonna be" and if she don't like it, deep down she'll respect you. She can't help ot. It's her DNA. 
 Hoyt:  Well, well, now I want to be you. 
 Jason:  F*** you. 
 Rene:  Hey, and if she don't respect you? She ain't someone that you wanna be with anyway. Okay? 
 Rene leaves. 
 Hoyt:  He's right. 
 Maxine comes. 
 Maxine (to Hoyt):  I've been keeping an eye on you, Hoyt. That is your third beer, and that is two too many. You set that down. Right now. 
 Hoyt:  You know, I plan on having about six more beers. And enough tequila to drown a Mexican sea captain, woman. Excuse me. 
 Scene 16: The vampire's tribunal - Magister, Bill, Eric 
 Bill:  Longshadow was choking the girl and would have killed her. 
 Magister:  So you murdered a higher life form for the sake of your pet. You broke an ancient and fundamental law. You decreased our numbers at a critical time on our history. Very bad. Very, very bad. 
 Bill:  Magister, Longshadow broke the law first. She was mine and he knew it. He would have killed her and fed from her. 
 Magister:  Hello, human. Irrelevant. Happens every day. 
 Bill:  He was stealing from Eric. 
 Magister (to Eric):  Sheriff? 
 Eric:  Yes, Magister, it's true. Longshadow was a thief and a liar. He was hurting my business. 
 Magister:  The business part, that is a serious offense. 
 Bill:  And it was the human who exposed Longshadow. Would you tell him, Eric? 
 Eric:  The only reason the girl was there was because I called her. 
 Bill:  To protect your wealth. 
 Eric:  To protect my wealth, yes. Magister, she is... valuable. 
 Magister:  Humans exist to serve us. That is their only value. 
 Bill:  There are those among us who think differently. 
 Magister:  Do you question my authority? I am the Magister. I was trained in the Inquisition and I am the adjudicator for every vampire territory in North America. As the humans say, the humans you love more than your own kind: Back your s*** down. 
 Bill wants to speak. 
 Eric:  Bill. 
 Magister:  Well, you haven't bored me. That works in your favor. And you seem to be obedient to your sheriff. 
 Eric:  For the most part. When it matters, yes, he is. 
 Magister:  The usual sentence is five years in a coffin chained with silver. During which time your body will waste to leather and sticks. You'll probably go insane. However... I'm feeling a bit... creative. 
 Scene 17: Arlene and Rene's party 
 Hoyt, Rene and Jason are playing. Arlene, Sookie and Amy are talking, seated around a table.  
 Arlene:  You know what I live most about Rene? Aside from his fine little Cajun butt. He's good to the kids. He's good to me. All the rest were fixer-uppers. But Rene, he's solid all the way to the foundation. I can count on him. And I've never had that in all my life. 
 Amy:  I know what you mean. I mean, I never knew I could have something like what I have with Jason. I'm not about to let anything destroy that. 
 Sookie:  I don't know anyone can trust anybody these days. They're always keeping things from you. You don't even know who people are or what they are. 
 Amy:  Well, you know what I love about Jason? Everything is just right there on the surface. You never have to wonder what he's thinking. 
 Sookie:  Yeah, because he ain't thinking. 
 Arlene laughs. Tara arrives. 
 Tara:  Hey, girlfriends, what's up? 
 Arlene:  Tara. You look... You look great. 
 Tara:  Prom night, 2000. I ain't wore it since. 
 Amy:  Well, it still fots you. 
 Sookie:  Tara, come here. 
 They go aside. 
 Sookie:  I've never seen you like this. Is this because of Sam.? I saw you. In his office. Why didn't you tell me? 
 Tara:  It's none of your business.

 Sam:  Oh, hey, Andy. You want a beer? 
 Andy:  I don't drink. 
 Sam:  Okay. 
 Andy:  Had me a very interesting conversation with a man at the naked community over in Beaumont. That's right, I already told you. Last night. Before you ran off to avoid talking to me. What's your story, Merlotte? Who's you people? 
 Sam:  I was adopted. That's the truth. At 15, I was on my own. 
 Andy:  Fifteen, huh? Where'd you go? Who took you in? I need to know what your life was before you brought up property in Bon Temps and women started getting killed. 
 Sam's Flash back: 
 He's 15. He arrives home. The door is open. The home is empty. 
 Sam:  Mom? 
 There's nothing in the kitchen. His room is still the same, with all his things.  
 End flash back. 
 Andy:  Sam. Sam. Where the hell did you come from? 
 Sam:  I come from the same place everybody comes from, Andy.

 Tara:  Listen. I have a situation. A very serious situation. And I need your help with it. Right now. 
 Andy:  I'm here on official police business and we're in the middle of a conversation. 
 Tara:  Well, let me wrap it up for you. He doesn't know anything. He didn't do anything. And he doesn't give a s***. Come on Sam. 
 Sam and Tara leave.

 Tara:  Quit acting like my d*** boss and just f*** me, please. 
 Sam:  Hey, did you have that exorcism? 
 Tara:  Can't you be a normal guy and go with it? 
 Sam:  Because I'm not a normal guy. 
 Tara:  Well, who the f*** cares? 
 Sam:  Damn it, Tara. I'm a person. I'm not a prop for you to use every time you need to feel better. 
 Tara:  Sam, please. I'm not right. 
 Sam:  You're not the only one with demons. Well, what the f*** do you want from me? 
 Tara:  I don't want a goddamn thing from you. I don't want nothing from nobody. 
 She leaves.
