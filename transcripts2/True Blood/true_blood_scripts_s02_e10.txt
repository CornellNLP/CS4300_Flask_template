 Scene 1: Hotel Carmilla/Bon Temps - Sookie, Eric, Jason, driver, man, woman 
 Sookie walks in the corridor. She enters in Eric's room. He's crying. 
 Sookie:  Eric. 
 Eric:  Godric is gone. 
 Sookie:  I know. I'm so sorry. 
 They kiss. He bites her. Suddenly Sookie wakes up; it was just a dream. 
 Sookie is in a car. 
 Jason:  What are you dreaming about? 
 Sookie:  Bill. 
 Jason:  This kind of reminds me that bus ride back from All-State. Nothing looks exactly the way I left it. Know what I mean? 
 Sookie:  I've never been away before. Seems like something's different to me tough. 
 Jason:  Yeah. (Looking outside) What the hell? Look at this guy. 
 Man outside to a woman:  Let go! 
 The two people fall on the car. 
 Driver:  They just ran in front of me. 
 Jason, Sookie and the driver go to check on them. 
 Sookie:  Are you all right? 
 They have black eyes. 
 Jason:  What the hell's wrong with your eyes? 
 Man:  Let's go. 
 Jason:  Wait, wait, where you going? 
 Woman:  We gotta find Sam! 
 Man:  It's almost time, man. 
 They leave

 Scene 2: Sookie's house - Eggs, Maryann, Carl 
 Maryann and Eggs decorate a tree. 
 Maryann:  What do you think? 
 Eggs:  I think you've outdone yourself. 
 Carl arrives with a dead bird. 
 Maryann:  Feathers. Perfection. I'm thinking more meat. 
 Carl:  Five more pounds of ground chuck? 
 Maryann:  Think about who this is for. Let's aim higher. 
 Carl:  Corn-fed Kobe it is. 
 Maryann:  You're finally getting it, Karl. I want the two of you to bring me the most expensive meat. Organs, kidneys, livers, anything you can find. 
 Eggs (he has black eyes):  You want us to go kill something so it's extra fresh? 
 Maryann:  No, don't worry. I have other people bringing us something living to sacrifice. 
 Scene 3: Andy's hotel room - Sam, Andy, Arlene 
 Sam is hiding in the room when someone comes in; it's Andy. 
 Sam:  Any sign of anybody outside? 
 Andy:   No. No bug-eyes here. Just a hangover. 
 Sam:  Thanks for going over there. 
 Andy:  Station was totally empty. Cells were all wide open. They think I'm a bad cop. You should see the square. Looks like New York City or something. People banging their heads on posts. Graffiti everywhere. People pissing all over the sidewalk. This whole town's going down the crapper. 
 Sam:  Yeah, trust me, I know. 
 Sam changes his clothes. 
 Sam:  I got no idea how we're going to deal with a goddamn maenad. 
 Andy:  A mae-what? 
 Sam:  Wait, you don't remember any of what I told you last night, before you passed out and spent the whole f*cking day in bed, sleeping off your bender? 
 Andy:  You said... Maryann Forrester was to blame for all of this. The bug-eyes and the craziness. 
 Sam:  Yeah, and the people showing up dead with their hearts cut out. In the back seat of your car? 
 Andy:  She did that? 
 Sam:  Yeah. She killed Daphne too. 
 Andy:  f*ck me. We got another serial killer. 
 Sam:  Listen. She is a supernatural creature. She is immortal. She has powers. And she's not leaving till she gets what she wants, which I think is me. 
 Andy:  What's she want you for? 
 Sam:  I think to cut my heart out while a bunch of naked people watch, all for... Dionysus or Satan, or some God who has horns. 
 Andy:  People thought I was crazy because I thought I saw a pig. 
 Sam:  Well, you did see a pig. And you were right. That pig was a part of all this. That pig was... doing some of Maryann's dirty work for her. 
 Andy:  Well, if what you say is true, we need to kill that bitch. 
 Sam:  She don't die, remember? 
 The phone rings. 
 Sam:  Hey Arlene. 
 Arlene (on the phone):  Sam, you gotta come to Merlotte's. 
 Sam:  Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. 
 Arlene:  There's a mob. They've got Terry and they are coming for me next. 
 Sam:  Arlene, I've already seen you all caught up in Maryann's weirdness. 
 Arlene:  Oh, Jesus, I know, but she's after us now, and she's crazy. I mean, she is Hannibal Lecter crazy! And I'm scared she's gonna get my kids! And nobody's even picking up the phone at the sheriff's office. 
 Sam:  All right. All right, I'll be right there. 
 She hang up. 
 Scene 4: Bill's house - Jason, Sookie, driver, Bill, Maxine, Hoyt, Jessica 
 Jason (on the phone):  This is Jason Stackhouse. Just want to let y'all know a couple of folks got hit by a car up on the square. But they... they ran off. 
 Sookie:  Ask them what the heck's going on all over town. 
 Jason (on the phone):  And if somebody could call me back and tell me if we've been attacked by terrorists or what. (To Sookie) f*cking answering machine at the sheriff's office. 
 Sookie:  Bill. There's something seriously wrong going on in Bon Temps. I can feel it. 
 Maxine (going out of the bathroom):  Well, if it ain't the vamper and his vamper lover. 
 Jason:  There's those f*cking eyes again. 
 Hoyt:  Mother, come back here. 
 Jessica:  Oh, thank God you're home. She's gone, like, totally batshit. 
 Bill:  What the devil...? 
 Jessica:  I had nothing to do with it, I swear! 
 Hoyt:  At first I thought maybe it was just a bad reaction to her new diet pills... 
 Maxine:  Get out of my way. 
 Hoyt:  ... but then we saw practically the whole town's got these eyes. 
 Bill:  How long has she been like this? 
 Jessica:  Since last night. 
 Maxine:  And I will be, for as long as it takes for him to get his offering. 
 Jason:  That sounds f*cking fucked-up. 
 Hoyt:  She's been on about Sam Merlotte and how they're gonna offer him to God. 
 Maxine:  Why don't you offer yourself up to me, Jason Stackhouse. You... dirty... little... monkey. 
 Hoyt:  Mama! 
 Bill:  Does she ever calm down? 
 Hoyt:  Playing Wii gets her to focus. But I wouldn't call it calm. 
 Maxine now plays at the Wii. 
 Maxine:  I'm gonna crack open our f*cking skull, bitch! 
 Bill:  So she says God is coming? 
 Hoyt:  Yes sir, and that everybody's waiting at Merlotte's so they can catch Sam and they can take him over to Maryann's. 
 Sookie:  Maryann's? Where's that? 
 Hoyt:  Well, it's your house. 
 Sookie:  What? 
 Maxine:  They're gonna rip that boy open and serve him up like barbecue! 
 Sookie:  Hoyt, has anyone been attacked by something with claws? 
 Hoyt:  Well, I heard Arlene say that that poor woman you found in Andy's car had her back scratched up pretty bad. And then I also heard somebody say that Daphne had some kind of weird scar on her back. 
 Sookie:  The new waitress at Merlotte's? 
 Jason:  There's a new waitress at Merlotte's? 
 Bill:  We should talk to her. 
 Hoyt:  She's dead. She had her heart cut out just like the other one. 
 Sookie:  Fudge! 
 Jason:  I'm going to Merlotte's and find out what the hell is happening on my turf. 
 Bill:  Jason, if this is the same creature we think it might be, you do not want to go anywhere near it, trust me. 
 Jason:  Mr. Compton, I ain't about to sit back and let monsters destroy my town. 
 Sookie:  Jason, this would be one of those times to use your head. 
 Jason:  Oh, I am. I ain't never been so clear in my whole life. This here is the war I've been training for. 
 Sookie:  Jason! 
 Bill:  He can take care of himself. We've seen that. 
 Sookie:  Be careful, you hear? Drive straight up to Merlotte's, get inside as fast as you can, and do not go into the woods by yourself. 
 Jason:  I won't. 
 Sookie:  I mean it. 
 Jason:  I know. Come here. 
 Jason leaves. 
 Sookie:  And where is Tara? 
 Hoyt:  She's been partying pretty hard over at Mary... it's just something that people say. "Party over at Maryann's." 
 Sookie:  I gotta get over there. 
 Bill:  After you. 
 Sookie and Bill leave. 
 Hoyt:  Should I have gone with them? 
 Jessica:  And leave me alone here with her? No f*cking way. 
 Scene 5: Merlotte's - Sam, Andy, Arlene, Terry, Jane, people 
 Sam and Andy arrive at Merlotte's; it's empty. 
 Sam:  Arlene? You here? 
 Andy:  Empty. Like the sheriff's office. 
 Sam:  No, there's people here. I can smell them. Arlene? 
 Arlene:  Sam? Ph thank you, Sam, for coming so fast. I know how much punctuality means to you. 
 Sam:  Are you all right? 
 Arlene:  I am now. Because soon he'll be getting what's his. 
 People come all around Sam and Andy. 
 Sam:  sh1t. 
 Andy:  Not this sh1t again. 
 They all have black eyes. 
 Arlene (to Terry):  At least shoot the cheap liquor! Bottom shelf, bottom shelf! 
 Terry:  We call this move "stress inoculation." f*ck. 
 Sam (to Andy):  Come on. Back door. 
 Arlene:  They're getting away! 
 Terry:  Go get him! 
 Sam:  Follow me! 
 A man:  I'll get you, Sam Merlotte! 
 Sam:  Hard! 
 Another man:  Cut his feet off! 
 Andy:  Freaks! 
 A woman:  m*therf*cker! 
 Sam (to Andy):  In here! In here! 
 Andy and Sam go in the big refrigerator. 
 Sam:  Damn it, this door don't lock from the inside! 
 Andy:  I can't hold it! 
 Sam locks it with something. 
 Sam:  Here. Okay, that'll do it. 
 Terry:  Hold up a second. We have our EPW right where we want him. And there ain't no place for him to go. 
 Jane:  And what does that mean? 
 Terry:  It means we have secured the target. Mission accomplished! Bodenhouse. Go call Maryann and tell her she can come pick him up. 
 Andy (to Sam):  We are f*cked. 
 Sam:  We're still alive. 
 Andy:  For now. What are we gonna do? Are we gonna have to kill them all? 
 Sam:  Even if we could, these are our friends and neighbors. 
 Andy:  And cousins. 
 Sam:  Right. We can't kill them. 
 Andy:  We are f*cked. 
 Sam:  Yes, we are. 
 Man on the phone:  Hello. 
 Jane (on the phone):  Hi. Peanut? 
 Man:  You sound nice. 
 Scene 6: Lafayette's house - Lafayette, Tara, Letti Mae 
 Tara:  It burns where I'm tied up. It burns like fire, Mama. 
 Letti Mae:  Tying her up's not making her better. 
 Lafayette:  I done told you, it's for her own good. Ours too. 
 Letti Mae:  Tara, Tara, baby. Tell your mama what you need. 
 Tara has black eyes. 
 Lafayette:  Tara, you strong than whatever this is and you know it. Now, get the f*ck up out of there! 
 Letti Mae:  If only Miss Jeanette were still alive. 
 Lafayette:  She don't need no damn backwoods witch. She need Thorazine and a padded cell. 
 Letti Mae:  "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. and forget not all his benefits. Who forgives all your iniquities." 
 Lafayette:  "Who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from destruction. Hallelujah, God." Jesus and I agreed to see other people. But that don't mean we don't still don't talk from time to time. 
 Lafayette:  You've been good to my Tara. If I hadn't left such a hole in this girl, maybe whatever's in there wouldn't have crawled in. 
 Lafayette:  I kicked her out on her birthday. I was feeling all poor, pitiful me because of the sh1t I had brought on myself. If I wasn't acting like a stupid little bitch, I would have seen trouble coming after her a mile away and I would have handled that sh1t. 
 Tara:  He's coming. He's on his way. And he's gonna kill us all. 
 Scene 7: Sookie's house - Sookie, Bill, Lafayette, Maryann 
 Sookie and Bill arrive at Sookie's house. 
 Bill:  What in God's name...? 
 Sookie:  Whatever the hell it is, it reeks. 
 They enter the house. 
 Sookie:  Tara? Tara? 
 Hell cell phone rings. 
 Sookie:  Lafayette, where is Tara? 
 Lafayette (on the phone):  She with me. I need to know when you gonna be back on town. 
 Sookie:  I'm here in what used to be my living room. 
 Lafayette:  Sook, you gonna have to get up out that house now. 
 Sookie:  Is Tara okay? 
 Lafayette:  I ain't half as worried about her as I am about you up in that f*cking house. Get out. Run! 
 Sookie:  Be right there. 
 She hangs up. 
 Sookie (to Bill):  Come on. 
 Maryann:  What are you doing in my house? 
 Sookie:  This is not your house. 
 Maryann:  It is now. 
 Bill:  I strongly suggest you remove yourself immediately. 
 Maryann:  My, you found yourself quite a specimen. Though I daresay there's nothing stopping him from one day leaving you cold. 
 Sookie:  You don't scare me. 
 Bill:  Sookie, go now. 
 Bill bites Maryann. 
 Maryann:  yes. Ravage me! Ravage me! 
 Sookie:  Bill! Bill! What did you do to him? 
 Maryann:  What are you? 
 Sookie:  None of our business! Bill, let's get out of here. 
 Maryann:  That was fun! What are you? 
 Sookie and Bill leave. 
 
 
 
 Scene 8: Merlotte's - Sam, Andy, Jason, Terry, Arlene, people 
 Andy:  Aren't you glad I didn't take your advice and quit drinking? This could save our lives. 
 Sam:  And if I'd left this town when I wanted to, nobody'd be in this situation. 
 Andy:  Don't beat yourself up, Sam. You've been real good to this town. Even if you're a sometimes-nudist. 
 Sam:  What if Terry had shot that guy in the head instead of the shoulder? The people are gonna start dying soon. 
 Andy:  People are already dying. Nancy Levoir, Daphne... hell, I never even knew her last name. 
 Sam:  Landry. Daphne Landry. If that was even her real name. 
 Andy:  I heard y'all was close. I'm real sorry. 
 Sam:  Thanks. 
 Andy:  When I was growing up I had a nanny. Her name was Annie. Annie the nanny. She used to say to me that... in the country of the blind, the one-eyed man was king. I think she told me that because she thought I was... one of the blind. But you... you got the burden of being the one-eyed man. I envy that. 
 Sam:  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Andy:  I don't either. 
 Jason arrives at Merlotte's. 
 Jane:  Sam? Do you know anybody named Peanut Burch? I wish I could remember. I know there's something I was supposed to do. 
 In the diner: 
 A woman (to a man):  Harder! Harder! Asshole. 
 Jason:  Oh, mama. 
 A man:  That's good. 
 Jason:  All right! This party's over! Come on! What the hell is wrong with you people? Piece of sh1t! Let's go! 
 A man:  Hey, asshole! 
 Jason:  Hey, Terry. 
 Arlen:  Terry! 
 Jason:  Come here. 
 Terry:  Ambush! 
 Jason:  Okay, stay chill. Nobody needs to get hurt. 
 A woman:  Yeah! Nail her! 
 Terry:  Wait, stop! Don't hurt my special lady. 
 Arlene:  Do it! I need a haircut anyway, baby. 
 Terry:  No. 
 Jason:  Yeah, I'm gonna do it! 
 Terry:  Timeout. Time the f*ck out! All right, Stackhouse. Name your demands. 
 Jason:  Okay. Here's how it's gonna be. Y'all go and leave, every last one of you. Leave us alone and then you can have her. 
 Terry:  All right. The order is to retreat. Immediately. God damn it! When I give an order, you follow it. Now get on out of here. We will unfuck this situation at a later date. Move it! Fall out! Out! Out! Left, right, left! Come on, then! Double-time. Let's go! All right, Stackhouse. You gonna hand her over. 
 Jason:  Keep moving. Move! The faster you move, the quicker you get her. 
 Everybody's out. Jason gives Arlene to Terry. 
 Arlene:  My hero. I love it when you get all military like that. Where's your guns? 
 Jason closes the door. 
 Scene 9: In Sookie's car - Sookie, Bill 
 Sookie:  Bill? 
 Bill:  I'm all right. 
 Sookie:  No, you are not all right. None of this is all right. I'm calling Eric. 
 Bill:  I will not turn to Eric. 
 Sookie:  I gotta get you to Dr. Ludwig! 
 Bill:  Sookie, what happened back there? What did you do to her? 
 Sookie:  I don't know. I swear. It was Maryann that attacked me in the woods. Even though I don't have a scar, I could feel her there on my back when she was touching me. 
 Bill:  I will kill her. 
 Sookie:  Good. How? 
 Bill:  Tara has been under Maryann's influence. Maybe she can be of some help to us. Give me your wrist si I can heal. 
 Bill feeds from Sookie. 
 Scene 10: Merlotte's - Jason, Sam, Andy, Terry, Mike 
 Jason:  Sam, it's Stackhouse. You can come on out. They're gone. Look, I got rid of all them saucer-eyed M*therf*ckers. 
 Andy:  Bullshit. 
 Jason:  I swear on my gran's grave. 
 They open the refrigerator's door. 
 Jason:  Oh, Andy, hey. 
 Andy:  Let's see your eyes. 
 Jason:  My eyes? Oh. Now get out here. I locked all the doors. 
 Sam:  Hey, thanks, Jason. But... I don't think they're gonna let up till they get me. 
 Andy:  How the hell did you get them out? 
 Jason:  I threatened to shoot a bunch of nails into Arlene's brain. But guys, come here. If we gonna get out of here, we gonna need even a bigger divergence. 
 Terry (who came in Merlotte's):  There's Sam Merlotte! Get him! 
 Jason:  That ain't exactly what I was talking about, but you work with what you got. Go! 
 Everyone is now back at Merlotte's around Sam, Andy and Jason. 
 Terry:  Sam Merlotte. There is no escaping, Sam Merlotte. The God Who Comes always gets what he comes for. And as for you, Jason Stackhouse. Not cool. 
 Jason:  There ain't no moral god gonna come nowhere near you people. 
 Mike:  And God ain't gonna be happy with you, Jason. I bet he'll eat you. I always wanted to know what human flesh tastes like. 
 Sam:  Guys. You guys, you gotta save yourselves. 
 Andy:  We'll get you out of here, Sam. 
 Sam:  Then what? She's not gonna let up. Ever. No, I'm ending this. 
 Andy:  No f*cking way! 
 Sam:  Maybe this'll all stop with me. 
 Sam goes to the people and they take him. 
 Andy:  No! 
 Scene 11: Lafayette's house - Tara, Lafayette, Letti Mae, Sookie, Bill, a girl 
 Lafayette:  Tara. Tara, would you snap the f*ck out of it! 
 He slaps her. 
 Letti Mae:  Lafayette! 
 Lafayette:  This has got to be the worst motherfucking intervention in history. 
 Someone knocks at the door. 
 Lafayette:  Oh, thank God. Sook. 
 Lafayette opens the door; it's a girl. 
 Girl:  Hey. How's it going? 
 Lafayette:  Never been better in my whole goddamn life. Come back later. 
 Girl:  There's no such thing as later during finals week. Calc so blows. 
 Lafayette:  Excuse me. Excuse me. I ain't selling tonight, Cream Cheese. Okay? 
 Girl:  Come on, I'll pay extra. 
 Lafayette:  You ain't hearing me. 
 Girl:  Well, I ain't leaving till I get the V. 
 Bill arrives and grabs the girl. 
 Bill:  Oh, you are leaving. 
 She leaves running. 
 Lafayette:  Slow your row. It ain't even me. Talk to your boy, Eric. He the one got me pushing the sh1t. 
 Sookie (arriving):  Where is she? 
 Lafayette:  You can come on in. 
 Sookie:  Tara. What's happened to you? 
 Tara:  Get me the f*ck out, you c**t, or I will kill you. 
 Lafayette:  We are loosing her, Sook. 
 Sookie:  It's all... dark. Nithing. 
 Letti Mae:  You see into her head? 
 Tara:  Stop trying to rape my brain. 
 Sookie:  I can't see or hear anything. It's not her. It's... she's gone. 
 Lafayette:  Don't say that Sook. She in there. Just... just keep trying. 
 Sookie:  I know, but what am I supposed to do? 
 Bill:  You have to go further into her mind than you ever have before. 
 Sookie puts her hands on Tara. 
 Tara:  You try and kill yourself? I don't blame you, with your fucked-up life. 
 Sookie sees the orgies. 
 Sookie:  There's something I can't... I can't cross. An abyss. 
 Bill:  I will glamour her. 
 Letti Mae:  What? 
 Bill:  It may help. 
 Sookie:  I don't want to hurt her. 
 Bill:  If we leave her like this, who knows what harm may come to her. Or us. 
 Bill:  Tara. You can feel my influence, can't you, Tara? Don't fight it. Let me in, Tara. Let me in. 
 Scene 11: Merlotte's - Arlene, Jason, Sam, Andy, Terry 
 They are all outside Merlotte's. Sam is attached on the top of a car. 
 Arlene:  Thank you, Sam. Thank you for giving us all this gift so that he can come into the world. 
 A voice:  Silence! It is me, the God Who Comes. (We see Jason as a God) I have come, and now I am here. 
 Mike:  You're the God Who Comes? 
 Andy (to Jason):  Horns. You need horns. 
 Jason:  Well, go get them. (To everyone) Sam Merlotte, you are my offering! People, your work here is done. Go home. 
 Jane:  Really? 
 Jason:  Oh, yes. He is the best offering ever. You will all have... great weather and... good crops. Now leave. 
 Terry:  Bullshit. God has horns. 
 Andy puts branches behind Jason's head. People see them as hornes. 
 A man:  Is that really god? 
 Sam:  Lord. Lord. Smite me. 
 Jason (to Andy):  What's he saying? I can't hear. 
 Andy:  I don't know. 
 Sam:  Smite me, Lord. 
 Jason (to Sam):  I don't even know what you saying, man. 
 Sam:  Smite me, m*therf*cker. 
 Jason:  I smite thee, Sam Merlotte! Die! 
 Sam disappears. 
 Andy:  What the f*ck just happened? 
 Jason (to Andy):  I got no f*cking idea. 
 Jason:  There. Happy? 
 Terry:  Well? Yeah. 
 Jason:  Tell your leader I am very pleased with my offering. 
 Jane:  Thank you, God. 
 Jason:  You are welcome. You're all blessed. Now go. 
 Terry:  Squad. Report to Maryann for debriefing. 
 Jane:  Anybody who wants to de-brief me can do so right now. 
 They all leave. There's only Jason and Andy left. 
 Andy:  What the hell happened to Sam? 
 Andy:  I don't know, man. I don't know. 
 Sam appears. 
 Sam:  I'll explain later. Just help me put these f*cking flares out before they start a fire. 
 Andy:  That's the last drink I will ever take. 
 Scene 12: Lafayette's house - Bill, Tara, Sookie, Lafayette, Letti Mae 
 Bill:  Tara, let Sookie in. 
 Sookie:  It's not working. 
 Bill:  Tara, you are safe here. You have to do exactly as I say. 
 Tara:  I am not your f*cking slave girl. 
 Lafayette:  If ever there was a time to listen to a white-man Tara, this would be it. 
 Letti Mae:  Jesus, please, Jesus. 
 Bill:  Let Sookie in. Sookie, now. 
 Sookie sees the orgies and other scenes. Tara's eyes become normal again. 
 Tara:  Oh, my God. I'm crazy. I'm really crazy. 
 Sookie:  No. No, it wasn't you. It's not you. 
 Tara:  Mama! I'm sorr... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mama. 
 Letti Mae:  I knew it wasn't you, baby girl. I knew it wasn't you. (To Sookie) Thank you. 
 Sookie:  I need some air. 
 Sookie and Bill go out. 
 Tara:  Eggs. I gotta go get Eggs. 
 Lafayette:  No. 
 Sookie:  I've known Tara my whole life, and every trace of her was gone. Replaced. And I thought vampires were the only ones who could hypnotize people. 
 Bill:  No offense, Sookie, but humans are shockingly susceptible to about every form of thought manipulation. 
 Sookie:  It's all coming from Maryann. All of it. They eat people's hearts. But she wants more. She wants their souls. And that chant. 
 Bill:  Chant? 
 Sookie tells the chant. 
 Bill:  Bacchus. 
 Sookie:  Bill. I've seen that look on your face before and I don't like it. 
 Bill:  I read about some ancient creatures many years ago. But I always assumed it was just a myth. But I believe Maryann might be one. 
 Sookie:  What is she, and more importantly, how do we kill her? 
 Bill:  I do not know how to defeat her, but I know one vampire who might. Might. But if I'm gonna make it by daylight, I must leave now. 
 Sookie:  Let's go. 
 Bill:  I must do this alone. But I'll be back by morning. And Jason and Sam, Tara and Lafayette... you can do more good for them here. 
 Sookie:  You're right. I left everybody before and look what happened. 
 Bill:  Can you do... whatever it was that you did to Maryann...? You do that again? 
 Sookie:  I don't know. I don't even know what it was that I did. 
 Bill:  All right. You keep your friends safe, and by all means, you stay away from your home. Promise me. 
 Sookie:  Promise. 
 Bill leaves. 
 Scene 13: Bill's house - Maxine, Hoyt, Jessica 
 Maxine:  But I never get to go to the party! You know how many invitations I've passed up to stay home with my crybaby son? 
 Hoyt:  No, you always go, and you always drag me along with you. 
 Maxine:  Oh, you selfish little sh1t. 
 Hoyt:  You can spew as much venom as you want, mama. I'm not letting you get anywhere near Merlotte's. 
 Maxine:  You could come with me, maybe meet a nice girl instead of that devil slut. 
 Jessica:  I'm getting tired of this sh1t. 
 Hoyt:  Treat Jess with respect, or I'm gonna lock your ass up in that cubbyhole until Vampire Bill get home. 
 Maxine:  Oh, you're Dirty Harry now, huh? Because you're dipping your penguin dick in that vamper tramp? You are cut from the same cloth as your daddy. You are both half-men. 
 Jessica:  Miss Fortenberry... 
 Hoyt (to Jessica):  Just calm down. 
 Maxine:  A half-man and a dead whore. Who else would have either of you? 
 Hoyt:  Jess, don't.
