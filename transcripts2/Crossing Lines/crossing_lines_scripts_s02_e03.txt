 Allo? 
 Hi, Tom. 
 Good morning. 
 Hello, Jaques. 
 Oh, my God. Tom! 
 Okay, take cover, take cover now! 
 How many ways in and out of the seventh floor? 
 What is going on? 
 Someone is shooting from the seventh floor! How many ways? 
 Just the stairwell and the lift, that's it. 
 Kill the lift. Call the police, tell them there is a mass shooting at this address. 
 Shouldn't you just wait for... 
 Police! I am armed! 
 This is Probationary Officer Annette... 
 Know the biggest mistake a rookie makes? 
 When they draw their weapon, they only see what's directly in front of it. 
 It's called tunnel vision. 
 What time is her mother coming? 
 She said she would be on the 5:00 p.m. from Paris. 
 Imagine how hard that trip will be. 
 Probably easier than her last trip. 
 Well, on the last trip at least there was hope. 
 What is it about morning in The Hague, huh? 
 The light looks like a Vermeer. 
 Oh, you know Vermeer? 
 Does that surprise you, Louis? 
 Kind of. 
 What's in the box? 
 Anne-Marie's things. 
 Don't forget that. 
 Actually, I thought... you might want it. 
 Yeah, I'd like that. Thanks. 
 Carlton, do you have a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 Hickman wants her nameplate? 
 It's not so surprising. 
 Good morning, all. 
 Hey, glad to officially have you on board. 
 Glad to be on board. 
 Welcome. 
 Grazie, Eva. Grazie mille. 
 You speak Italian? 
 And Dutch, and German, and English. 
 What about Irish? 
 Sorry, nobody understands Irish. 
 Amen. 
 Is this me? 
 Uh... yeah. Yeah, it's yours. 
 This the sniper in Paris yesterday morning? 
 Five dead, including two police officers, a young rookie with her training officer having breakfast. 
 Wrong place, wrong time? 
 Appears that way. 
 This what you wanted to show me? 
 No. 
 It's about Rebecca. 
 She's going to be our prosecutor. 
 I hear she was good. 
 Very good. 
 Is she ready? 
 Yes. I think so. 
 Major? 
 Yeah? 
 I'm sorry. Dorn is here with Moreau, the Paris detective? 
 I'm coming. 
 Okay. 
 If I can be of help, you let me know. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Here. Louis, Hickman, you recognize Moreau? 
 He's just come from that horrific sniper shooting in Paris to request our help tracking the shooter. 
 There was a note left by the shooter. 
 The original is being tested for evidence, but I... I brought you a photocopy. 
 "The proles will refuse to bellyfeel blackwhite. 
 One hundred million Euro by Thursday, or five more will die somewhere in Europe. 
 You cannot stop me. W.S." 
 By Thursday? May I? 
 Tomorrow. 
 "Bellyfeel blackwhite?" What the hell does that mean? 
 It's Newspeak, which is, of course, the language that George Orwell created for 1984. 
 What does it mean? 
 Ah, well, in Oldspeak, it... roughly it means, 
 "You can't pull the wool over the peoples' eyes." 
 In this particular instance, I... 
 I think it means that instinctively people will reject the notion that black is white. 
 Black is white? 
 It's one of the central premises of the book. 
 The authoritarian government insists that citizens unquestioningly believe things that are inherently untrue. 
 Such as black is white. 
 He signs it "W.S." 
 Well, because the main character in the novel is Winston Smith. 
 Wasn't Winston Smith a bureaucrat? A functionary? 
 I don't remember him being violent at all. 
 No, he wasn't. And certainly, he didn't kill anyone, and of all people, he would not be participant in the multiple targeting at random. 
 Well, then, maybe he's just doing this to throw us off. 
 A killer like this usually doesn't do anything without reason. 
 He can't honestly believe anyone's going to give him that money. 
 Moreau, has he been in contact with anyone since he left that note? 
 No. No one. 
 Well, then, he's not expecting to get any money. 
 He's using this as a ruse to keep us from understanding what his true goal is. 
 Which starts with understanding 1984. 
 The square, it must have more than five people in it. 
 Why'd he stop shooting? 
 Initially, we thought people must have run away. 
 But there was only one shot heard. 
 One shot that killed five people? 
 No, no, but there was only one shot heard. 
 And then the female officer ran across the square into the building. 
 She took a grand risk. 
 Is that when he shot her? 
 She wasn't shot. 
 There was a confrontation at the site of the shooting. 
 He pushed her out the window, seven floors to her death. 
 So you're taking the case? 
 Yes. But I have a question. 
 Does your boss know you're here? 
 Moreau, go to the scene. 
 I'll get it authorized in the Court. 
 That should be enough to handle any objections that Laveaux might have. 
 You'll be more comfortable inside. 
 I feel like a child on her first day at school. 
 First day back to school, and it's a school in which you excel, Rebecca. 
 Here goes. 
 Well, it's not as elegant as the one you left. 
 Please. It's absolutely fine. 
 Come with me, Rebecca. 
 I have to get authorization from the Court allowing our team to track the sniper in Paris. 
 It's a good place for you to start. 
 I think that you should be a part of this case right from the very beginning. 
 Can I... I just need a moment to freshen up. 
 I'll just be down the hall. 
 Oh, God, what am I doing here? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I can do this. 
 Carl? 
 I'm missing something, something right in front of me. 
 Well, stay on it. 
 We don't have much time, and even less to go on. 
 There are only three victim files? 
 Yes, a sanitation worker, a bicyclist, and an au pair, but we found no connection. 
 Yeah, but there were five victims. 
 What about the officers? 
 You want to investigate them? 
 We need to know who they were. 
 What is it? 
 Two Parisian officers were murdered, so our detectives are not going to be happy about an outside agency intruding on their case. 
 The only reason for use to be involved would be another shooting in a different country. 
 That's it, that's it. 
 That's what's bugging me. 
 "Five more will die somewhere in Europe." 
 If he had said, "Five more will die," the assumption would be that he meant Paris and we could not be on the case. 
 This note has the exact right phrasing to ensure that we are involved. 
 You think it was planned. 
 I don't know, but... 
 I got a hard time with the concept of coincidence. 
 I've felt more welcome in the ladies changing room. 
 Really? I've never been welcome in one. 
 Sebastian, check up there if there is any evidence. 
 Arabela, come with me. We'll talk to the witnesses. 
 Tommy and Eva, look at the tactical. 
 Do you want to know how he did it? 
 Mostly why he did it from there. 
 Commissaire Laveaux. 
 This scene is closed. 
 I have an authorization from the ICC. 
 This has nothing to do with the ICC. 
 Two Parisian officers were killed. 
 You can't just come in here... 
 You're right. You're right. 
 You're right. You're right. You're right. 
 The man who killed your comrades left a note threatening to do the same somewhere in Europe. 
 We will participate only if the case takes us outside of France to another country. 
 Until then, we want to provide assistance. 
 You lost two officers and I know what you feel, the pressure you are under. I just want to help. 
 I give you my word. 
 Show them the scene. 
 Thank you. 
 ... today in Paris where a sniper opened fire in a public square not far from... 
 ... National University... 
 Whiskey? 
 ... at 9:00 a.m. this morning, two French police officers... 
 Double. were killed, along with three other civilians. 
 The victims were pronounced dead at the scene. 
 The medical examiner has determined... 
 ... were struck, execution-style, with a single bullet to the head. 
 Police have not released the identities of the victims, pending notification... 
 Another. of next of kin. 
 Tearing up our authorization form from the Court? 
 Did I, or did I not? 
 Ah... 
 Seeger, this one has much to teach you. 
 I think you all do. 
 The coffee cart owner is ready if you'd like to talk to him. 
 Yeah. 
 It's not optimal. 
 The other side of the square would be. 
 The sun would be behind him at this time in the morning. 
 Maybe he isn't that experienced? 
 Nobody who can hit a moving target from this range is an amateur, especially shooting into the sun. 
 My guess would be military training. 
 A lot of it. 
 There are other reasons to use this building, though, despite the sun. 
 For instance, this floor being under construction. 
 Like Hickman says, that's probably no coincidence. 
 I'm ready for some scans. 
 Jaques Lemière. L-E-M-I... 
 The other officers have your name. 
 We just want to know what you remember. 
 Remember? I remember all of it. I... 
 I will never forget. 
 How can I ever forget something like this? 
 I mean, you watch television, but you don't think it will ever... 
 Not to you. Other people, but not you... 
 Jaques... breathe. 
 Now, sit and take a sip of water, and relax. 
 Look at that. 
 What? 
 The window frame, the one he fired from? 
 There's a smooth, almost perfect covering of gases and gunshot residue. 
 On what part of the frame? 
 All of it. 
 Top, bottom, sides. 
 It's an even dispersement in all directions. 
 That's why no one heard the shots. 
 I had just brought out Jean's breakfast. 
 Jean? 
 Yes, the local officer who walks this area. 
 The one with the female officer? 
 Yeah. Yeah, Anette, his trainee. She was... 
 What happened to her was... 
 Jaques, stay focused. 
 Okay. 
 The officer arrived and ordered coffee? 
 No. No, I prepared his order first. 
 First? Before he arrived? 
 Yes, Jean is here every morning, 9:00 sharp. He is very methodical. 
 Was. He was methodical. 
 What happened next? 
 Um, I was taking another order, and there was a shot. 
 A shot. 
 Yes, one shot, like... like a crack. 
 I turned, and could see it came from this building. 
 I saw the smoke, saw the rifle being pulled back in, and I heard Anette make a sound, and then I saw Jean. 
 He was... he had been hit. 
 That one shot hit the officer? 
 Yeah. 
 And then Anette ran off toward the building, and it was only after that I... 
 I noticed other people on the ground, other people that had been shot. 
 After the officer ran off, the others were already shot? 
 Yes. 
 You're sure. 
 Yeah, I'm sure. 
 "Bellyfeel blackwhite... " 
 "Bellyfeel blackwhite." 
 "Bellyfeel... " 
 My team has gone over this note many times. 
 It doesn't seem to make much sense, huh? 
 We're going through 1984 as well. 
 Forensics came back on the original. The note is completely clean. 
 No prints, no DNA. 
 Can't be easy to handwrite a note and leave no prints or DNA. 
 Same thing I thought. 
 Four shots in the time he had and from where he shot is remarkably good. 
 Knows his way around forensics, too. 
 No prints or DNA on the note. 
 Are we looking at a cop? 
 Sure starting to look that way. 
 And we also know why no one heard any shots. 
 Yeah. The ScanGen picked up gunshot residue and gas particles on the window frame in a wide, in a wide diffuse pattern. 
 Evenly spread, the way a suppressor would dispense the gases. 
 But they did hear one shot. 
 Yes, the last one. 
 The one that killed the older cop and drew the rookie. 
 Those officers weren't wrong place, wrong time. 
 They were the targets. 
 The officers were the target? 
 The only shot that anybody heard was the one that killed the older police officer. 
 The witness said when the officer was shot... 
 The others were already on the ground. 
 The audible shot was the last one. 
 He used a silencer, but he wanted the last shot heard. 
 Why? 
 Eva said it. To draw the young officer to him. 
 Why go to all this trouble to kill two officers he could have shot while they were having their coffee? 
 Because he wanted a show. 
 Sir? He says he's the sniper. He calls himself Winston Smith. 
 That's him. That's the note, "W.S." 
 I'm sorry, sir, he asked specifically for Major Daniel. 
 Sebastian, trace the call. 
 Winston Smith? 
 I'm calling from a prepaid cell phone that cannot be traced. 
 Then we should talk in person. Let's meet. 
 Do you find this funny? 
 No. There is nothing funny about murder, Mr. Smith. Nothing. 
 You have my note? 
 Yes. 
 Then I'm guessing by your attitude you also have my money? 
 You surely know that we need more than a day to raise that sum. 
 The European Central Bank holds money from every country in the EU, does it not? 
 28 countries contributing just over three and a half million each. 
 A statistical blip. 
 100 million is no blip. 
 Keep that phone with you. I'll call you in the morning. 
 You asked for me. Do we know each other? 
 Everybody knows you. 
 You and your team are quite famous. 
 But that could be undone doublefast, even vaporized. 
 What the hell was that? 
 I guess that's more Newspeak, like 1984. 
 The money is more plausible if you split it in 28 ways. 
 You'll never get 28 countries to agree. 
 Have you ever watched a session of the European Parliament? 
 I'm not asleep. 
 But you are in the dark. 
 I watched the sun go down. 
 There was no reason to turn the light on. 
 Sun went down two hours ago. 
 How did it go in Paris, at the shooting scene? 
 Routine. 
 Dorn is making some calls about getting the money. 
 No cases at home. 
 Good idea. 
 Agreed. 
 So... what is troubling you? 
 I'm not sure I can do this, Louis. 
 Everything seemed foreign to me. So... changed. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 This work is too important. 
 If you're not capable, you should not do it... 
 I didn't say I wasn't capable. 
 I mean... what do you expect, the first day after six years? 
 You are the one who said you want to quit. 
 I've never said quit in my life. 
 I'm sorry. 
 If you think I'm not capable of this job, you're going to be very surprised, Mr. Daniel. 
 Very surprised. 
 You will be a star. 
 You always are. 
 Okay. 
 Now, I'm ready for bed. 
 I'm not really tired. 
 Did I say tired? 
 Did the word tired ever come out of my mouth? 
 What time is it? 
 I... 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nurse! Nurse! 
 What time is it? 
 Shh... What? What, baby? 
 How long? 
 Let me get the doctor, okay, and then I'll explain it all to you. 
 Everything, okay? 
 Yes. 
 
 
 
 What? 
 Where? 
 Are you the team from the ICC? 
 Major Louis Daniel. 
 Detective Ripchen. 
 We appreciate the assistance. 
 We've never had anything like this... 
 We are not assisting. 
 This same man killed five people two days ago in Paris. 
 This is a cross-border, systematic, ongoing crime. 
 This is ours now, officially. Your superiors have been notified. 
 Well, no one told me. 
 Then make the call, and when you learn I'm right, turn over any witness information to Detective Seeger. 
 Let me make some calls. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that was pretty straightforward. 
 We have work to do, so let's do it. 
 Hey, mate. McConnell, Berger, Seeger and Vittoria from the ICC. 
 Yes, we heard you were coming. 
 All the bodies are still in the spots where they fell? 
 All five. 
 Medics didn't work on them? 
 They were all shot through the head. There was nothing to work on. 
 Where did the shots come from? 
 We don't know. 
 No one heard a single shot to give us a direction to look. 
 He used suppressors. 
 There were some searches of the rooftops, but no evidence was found in the dark. 
 There will be another search this morning. 
 I might be able to use the ScanGen to establish a bullet path, a trajectory through the victims. 
 If we can do that with two or three, we can triangulate. 
 But you'll need to know the exact position they were in before they were shot, though. 
 Yeah, whether they were sitting or standing. 
 Did the family members stay? 
 Yes. They are in the mosque. 
 The Imam and his wife are taking care of them. 
 We can see if they remember whether they were sitting or standing. 
 While we scan the bodies. 
 Famke? 
 Can you put the kettle on? 
 I found some old books in storage. 
 Doesn't anyone read the law around here anymore? 
 You are... ? 
 Rebecca Daniel? We met yesterday? 
 Well, I know who you are, but you're here, and it's only 7:00 a.m. 
 Don't worry. 
 I don't expect you to be here this early. 
 No, no, I love it. No one ever... 
 Let me put those books away. 
 Famke... right now I would love a cup of black coffee. 
 Okay. 
 Then... I want legal precedent on multiple homicide and all lesser included gun and battery charges, in Paris, France and Sofia, Bulgaria. 
 I want to be ready to charge this sniper properly when they catch him. 
 The books can wait. 
 You mean if they catch him, right? 
 Oh, Famke, you clearly don't know my husband. 
 Come on, you son of a bitch! 
 Funny, you usually say that right to my face. 
 I don't think I've ever caught you calling me names. 
 "Keep that phone with you. I will call you in the morning." 
 That's what he said to me. 
 I was there. 
 He lied. 
 Did he? It's still morning. 
 He killed five more people. 
 He said he was going to do that in the note. 
 "Five more on Thursday". As far as I can tell, this whole thing happened right about midnight. 
 He waited until Thursday. 
 He didn't even give me a chance to get the money. 
 "Me?" 
 Us. 
 He didn't give us a chance, and I'm sure that he would argue that point. 
 He said "on Thursday." 
 That has passed, but you don't really think this is about the money, do you? 
 What is it about? 
 That we don't know yet. 
 Hey, lads! We might have something. 
 Not yet. 
 So, I was able to scan the bodies and establish the path of the bullets as they passed through them. 
 Arabela, can you turn off the lights, please? 
 Okay, these lines are bullet trajectories. 
 Well, Arabela and I were able to talk to the companions of the victims about their position before they were shot. 
 Most of them were very specific. 
 For instance, victim one was sitting cross-legged on a blanket watching the movie, victim two was sitting up with his fiancé leaning back against him, and victim three was walking through the aisles coming back from the loo. 
 Now, when I add that information to the modelling... 
 That's the highest point. 
 Well, this point definitely covers the entire square. 
 I'll go get the ScanGen and see if we can find any residue, make sure this is the right spot. 
 Hey, don't bother. 
 "Minority of one." 
 Mean something to you? 
 It's another reference to the book. 
 The lead character asks if being a lunatic is just being a minority of one. 
 Just because I don't like to read doesn't mean I'm not good at it. 
 Guys. 
 Enjoying yourself? 
 There is nothing enjoyable about murder, Mr. Daniel. 
 Nothing. 
 You're not interested in money. 
 I'll be dead long before I can spend any of it. 
 What do you want? 
 You used to be French, right? 
 I am still French. 
 No. You're European now. 
 A citizen of the European Union. We gave up our identities, Louis. 
 We let a bunch of bureaucrats throw away centuries of individuality for easier trade. 
 For money. 
 Even your team is an abomination. 
 What are you doing on a rooftop in Sofia, Bulgaria? 
 That's how it works. How the collective takes over. 
 First they change your money so you're on shaky economic ground, then they take over the familiar forms of local government, like the police. 
 Everything you know changes until you're just like a cog in the wheel like Winston Smith. 
 A functionary. 
 Oh, Louis. Really? 
 Isn't that beneath you? 
 What is it you want? 
 I want my message out. 
 I want people to hear what I have to say, and I want you to do it, you and your team of b*st*rd cops. 
 You want me to deliver your message? 
 Mm-hmm, at a press conference before the world's cameras. 
 And if I don't? 
 I have five rounds for tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. 
 How will I contact you to give you an answer? 
 The press conference will be the answer. 
 Or not. 
 I'll get the message. 
 Arabela, tell the press we'll make an announcement. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Wait, wait, there's... there's something else that we need from them. 
 We need to know where on the continent that chopper's images are broadcasting live. 
 Absolutely live. 
 He saw me. He saw me raise the finger. 
 Yeah. Well, most networks add a 30 second time delay for breaking news, in case something too shocking happens. 
 I'd like to find out what the network considers too shocking to show. 
 The list gets smaller every day. 
 All right, listen up. 
 The press doesn't like to talk to the police in groups. 
 They don't want to look like they're being bullied. 
 But separately, they all want to make out like they're your friend so they can call on you later for a story. 
 Any cop who trusts the press is an idiot. 
 Let them think you will cooperate. 
 Let them think you're friends. 
 That's right. Hand out cards, give them your cell number. 
 Can I give them his cell number? 
 Aye, and I'll give them yours. 
 Who gave you my cell number? 
 You don't want to know. 
 Louis, finding where those images are broadcasting live will give us an area to look in, but we need to find a way to narrow that down. 
 You have an idea? 
 Yeah. 
 Based on who I think he is. 
 You think? 
 I'm pretty sure. 
 And if you're wrong? 
 People may die. 
 People are dying now. 
 What do you got? 
 Only four sources broadcast from that particular chopper live without any delay whatsoever. 
 A station covering west coast of Spain and Portugal. 
 And all of Norway. 
 Half of Austria, and all of Switzerland. 
 Not Sofia? Not locally? 
 They weren't broadcasting anything at all. 
 It's too close for them. The bodies are still on the ground. 
 Spain and Portugal are too far for what he's capable of doing. 
 Paris, home, now Sofia, and, apparently, home again. 
 Norway seems too far as well. 
 It is. Our best shot is Austria or Switzerland. 
 You guys should head in that direction on the chopper. 
 And do what, man? 
 Austria and Switzerland is a pretty big search area. 
 Leave that to me. 
 What do you mean? 
 I'm going to do this press conference and I'm going to narrow it down. 
 Didn't he say he wanted Louis to do the press conference? 
 Who is doing the talking will be the least of his problems. 
 Especially when he hears what I have to say. 
 But won't that put more victims at risk? 
 Only if it doesn't work. 
 I'm not the guy you want on a raid of a sniper's house anyway, am I? 
 And I want to meet this Mr. Winston in person. 
 Sebastian, you should stay and we can check out any information that comes in. 
 We will be on the sat phone. 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 My name is Carl Hickman. I'm a retired New York City detective who now works for the ICC's investigative team out of The Hague. 
 We are currently assisting the Sofia, Bulgaria police in investigating this latest cowardly attack by the same man who shot a number of people in Paris a couple of days ago. 
 We have actually been in contact with this piece of sh... with this perpetrator, and he asked us to have this press conference... 
 Cowardly's right. 
 Shooting people from the roof of something, they don't even know they are targets. 
 Kind of like hunting though. 
 It's nothing like hunting...  
 ... could make a point is by murdering 10 innocent people and demanding... 
 Another. 
 Mein gott. How about just asking? 
 ... but never mind what he wants. 
 Here's what we're going to talk about instead. 
 I'm going to tell you how you can help us catch him. 
 You know how after police catch a serial killer, the neighbors always say that they had no idea? 
 "He was such a quiet guy, he never bothered anybody." 
 Well, that's not this guy. 
 That's not the make-up of a personal cause perpetrator. 
 This guy's not quiet. This guy bothers everybody. 
 You know him, but you're not friends. 
 In fact, he doesn't have many people that he tolerates and he has no friends because he's a jerk. 
 And he complains. Loudly. 
 He will have complained repeatedly about the formation of the EU, and about the loss of individual identity under the new system. 
 And he might have said, at different times, something very similar to these words, 
 "We let a bunch of bureaucrats toss out a century worth of individuality just to make trade easier. 
 For money." 
 Or something like... 
 "The collective takes over. 
 You know, first they change your money, then they change the police, and then they change the government and they crush you like you're nothing, and you're just a cog in the wheel." 
 That's this guy. 
 So help us catch him, and call the number that's flashing on the bottom of the screen. 
 If this guy sounds familiar, call us. 
 Thank you. 
 Hickman. 
 Are you sure? 
 The description fits him perfectly. 
 Plus, the caller said this guy's obsessed with 1984, and that was not public info. 
 Did they tell you his real name? 
 Alexander Fuster, Austrian National. 
 There are some newspaper articles about an Alexander Fuster who fought for the French Foreign Legion and then headed a SWAT team. 
 Europol referred him for prosecution after an on-duty shooting. 
 Prosecution? 
 According to the reports, a rookie cop misidentified a hostage as the bad guy, and Fuster killed him before he had any authorization. 
 Maybe that's why he took his time with the rookie in Paris. 
 I'll let you know what happens. 
 All right. 
 Austria, outside Klagenfurt, the south border. 
 It's time. 
 The cabin is about a half kilometer in. 
 We have a soft perimeter right now. 
 Tell your men to find cover. 
 He's a fierce accurate long-range shot. 
 Alexander, come out! 
 Are you okay, sir? 
 You are completely surrounded! 
 Don't make this... 
 Tommy, how good is he? 
 One of the best I've ever seen. Why? 
 He could have shot me both times. 
 He shot high. 
 Well, you don't know that for sure. 
 Major, I don't think that's... 
 Alexander! 
 I am coming out of cover! 
 Unarmed! Let's talk! 
 Let me know when you have a shot. 
 Yes, Major. 
 You didn't bring me here to shoot me without talking first. 
 You have something to say to me. 
 Come out. 
 Alexander. 
 Busybodies like you ruined my life. 
 I didn't pull that trigger. 
 I had no intention of hurting that hostage, and Europol knew it. 
 And they had no authority to be in Austria, much less telling me and my men what I could do. 
 Europol, Interpol, and now your ICC. 
 Leave the local police alone, can you do that? 
 The world is getting smaller. 
 Every day, a bit smaller. 
 And swallowing people. 
 Swallowing lives, swallowing individuality. 
 I am not losing my identity, it's growing. 
 I am a citizen, not just of France, but a citizen of Europe, of the world. 
 When people realize that Italian sergeants and Irish cops are bullying their sovereign citizens and killing people they have no jurisdiction over, they will rebel. 
 No one has to be killed by anyone. 
 I have a shot. 
 Me, too. 
 I have two snipers of my own, and right now, they both have shots. 
 Are they good? 
 Very. 
 Because if they can't get a shot off before I do, then it's lights out for you. 
 For both of us. 
 But the difference is, I am prepared to die. 
 I've mailed manifestos to all the major papers of Europe. 
 I've taped videos for the news networks. 
 You don't have to die for your message to be heard. 
 Your smaller world is a visual one. 
 Today, you pretty much do have to die to make your point. 
 You made your point... for nothing. 
 Michel, we're going to go with terrorism as well. 
 Rebecca... we will not be prosecuting the sniper. 
 I'm sorry? 
 The team, he made them kill him. 
 Is Louis all right? 
 Oh, fine. They're on the way back home. 
 Good. 
 Thank you, Rebecca. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Did the team go home? 
 Yeah, yeah, everybody just left. 
 Did, um... 
 Anne-Marie's mom, did she come by today and... and get her stuff? 
 No. 
 Oh. 
 She called. 
 She came all the way to Amsterdam and then she couldn't face the office. 
 She said coming here made it too real, too final. 
 Shari, my... my friend from the carnival, she... she woke up last night. 
 Oh, she did? Why didn't you tell me? 
 Ah, just, uh, didn't find the time today. 
 How is she? 
 The doctors say that she's better than... than they'd... than they'd hoped. 
 But... ? 
 She wants to know how long she was unconscious. 
 I think she really wants to know what happened. 
 Fair question. 
 Yeah. It's the answer that I don't like. 
 What's the answer? 
 Rough stuff happens to people around me, Louis, good people. 
 I'm not crying about it. 
 It's just true. 
 I have known you for years. 
 Nothing bad's happened to me. 
 I said "good people." 
 Want me to come with you, to be your moral support? 
 No. 
 Some walks you've got to do on your own, you know? 
 Yes. I do know. 
 Thank you. 
 Should be for everyone to see.
