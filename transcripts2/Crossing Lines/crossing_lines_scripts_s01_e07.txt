 Buongiorno, Ragazzi! 
 Hey. 
 Hey. I brought love. 
 Love? 
 Uh-huh. Bocconotti. 
 "Boccone" means "mouthful," but I call them "Boccone del Amore," which means "Mouthfuls of Love." 
 Oh, they're a little bit like windbeutel. 
 "Windbeutel?" 
 You know what's wrong with Germany? 
 You don't use passion in your food names. 
 Yes, we do. 
 "Sauerbraten?" "Wier Schnitzel?" 
 Wiener Schnitzel is Austrian. 
 Tommy, which would you prefer to eat? 
 Something called "sauerbraten," or something called "Mouthfuls of Love?" 
 Anything quiet. 
 Didn't shakespre already say, "A rose by any other name is still a rose." 
 Yeah. 
 But that was about smell, and smell is not love. Smell is smell. 
 I'm going to go where people know how to be quiet. 
 Did you party again last night? 
 Chill out, mother, will you? 
 He needs more love. 
 Tommy. 
 Sir. 
 Your irishman smells like a distillery. 
 Good morning, Dorn. 
 There's something I need to show you. 
 This is the hotel room I was in last week in Moscow. 
 You were in Moscow? 
 I secreted a camera to send back these images. 
 The ICC gave me my own aes-encrypted wp to wifi. 
 They found it in less than a minute. 
 They are unusually good. 
 You were not supposed to go. 
 The point, Louis, is that Dimitrov knew. 
 He knew I was there. 
 He knew I was looking for him. 
 Those are his men. 
 Are you absolutely certain that the Marianski kidnapping had nothing to do with him being my source? 
 I'm sure. 
 The kidnapping was planned by the ex-wife. 
 To hurt him, for his money. 
 She confessed. 
 And you've said nothing about my looking into this? 
 No. No one. 
 Except Rebecca. 
 Oh, I told it to Rebecca. 
 She went back to Paris yesterday. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Rebecca, 
 I'm coming home this morning. 
 Oh! 
 Louis, that's lovely. 
 Could we have lunch together? 
 Are you asking me on a date? 
 Yes. 
 I'd love that. 
 Good. 
 I'll see you at noon. 
 Okay, see you. 
 Anne-Marie? 
 Yes? 
 I need to go to Paris for the day. 
 Anne-marie :  Okay. 
 Anne-Marie? 
 Do you know where Hickman is? 
 Anne-marie :  He said he had to run an errand. 
 [Clears throat awkwardly] 
 Do you speak English? 
 Doesn't everybody? 
 We're certainly trying. 
 May I see the manager? 
 Do you have an appointment? 
 No, but when he knows what I'm here about, he'll want to talk to me. 
 I'm afraid you can only see Mr. Stoop with an appointment. 
 So let's make an appointment. 
 He has nothing free till Monday. 
 [Sighs] 
 You don't need to check? 
 No. 
 We have procedures in place. 
 You're not the type to hide behind procedure. 
 I'm not hiding. 
 No, you're sitting at the help desk, keeping your fingers busy so that the rest of the staff can see that you're still prepared to get your hands dirty even though you're wearing a 1,000 Euro suit. 
 And your nametag says "Secretary," but "Anika" is no more a secretary than the secretary of state, and you don't follow procedures, you write them. 
 It's pronounced Ahh-ni-ka. 
 Oh, "Anika." 
 And my suit cost 800 Euros, and, though I'm moderately impressed and just a little bit flattered, you still can't see him. 
 Anika, I'm going to give you a way out of our little impasse by asking you to put this account number under his nose, along with the magic word "Carnival." 
 Please? 
 Please. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Berger. 
 Hickman :  Keep the line open. 
 Okay, you have five minutes. 
 Where's your panic button? 
 Anika :  Excuse me? 
 Where's your panic button? We're about to be... 
 [Shouting] Everyone down! Down! 
 [Firing weapons] 
 [Screaming, yelling] 
 [Fires gun] 
 Down on the ground! 
 [Fires gun] 
 Man : Are you deaf of stupid? Get on the floor! 
 [Shooting out cameras] 
 Your attention, if you please. 
 I'm not here for your money, I am here for the bank's money. 
 What they have stolen, I am stealing back. 
 For most of you, this will go smoothly and efficiently, and you can get back to your lives. 
 However, there may be one or two who believe this is a time for heroes. 
 Wolf : Hit the glass. 
 [Firing] 
 Wolf : The phone. 
 [Firing] 
 He only misses if he wants to. 
 So... are there any heroes amongst you today? 
 Anyone who would like to interfere in our business here? 
 Because if you do, we will not only kill you, we will kill every single person in this bank.

 Crossing Lines 01x07 
The Animals 
Original Air Date July 28, 2013 
 What's going on? 
 [Yelling over cell phone] 
 It's Hickman. 
 He seems to be inside a robbery. 
 Dorn... 
 Can you take care of Paris for me, please? 
 Your American is inside a bank robbery? 
 Quite an unlucky fellow. 
 Bad luck or coincidence? 
 Coincidence is a concept I have a great deal of difficulty with. 
 Get your cell phones out and hold them in your right hand where I can see 'em! 
 Lot of great big bags to bring to a robbery. 
 Three, four, five bags. 
 Yes, I can see that. 
 Fully automatic machine pistols. 
 Who are you? 
 [Gunman shouts angrily] 
 Come on! 
 Come on. 
 That's it, go on. 
 Hey... 
 Where's your phone? 
 My right hand is disabled. 
 I can't hold a phone in it. 
 What? 
 You said to use my right hand. 
 What's going on? 
 Says his right hand don't work. 
 Are you trying to be funny? 
 No. 
 You think you're John Wayne? 
 Not even close. 
 Use your left hand. 
 I got this one. 
 Sorry, Wolf. 
 No worries. Get the manager. 
 You know why I wear a wolf mask? 
 You smell like a wet dog? 
 Wolves are adept at seeing their way through traps. 
 They have an uncanny talent for reading the lay of the land. 
 Hunters even report them digging up traps and deactivating them before they become a problem. 
 You're not going to become a problem, are you, John Wayne with the crippled hand? 
 Should I deactivate you? 
 No problem here. 
 [Crunching] 
 He hung up. 
 I got a trace, though. 
 He's at the International Bank den Haag. 
 I told the locals we have an officer inside. 
 He said six robbers, five bags of equipment, and full auto pistols. 
 I can get inside the security cameras. 
 Man : Move! Move! Get in there! 
 Move it! 
 Look what I found in the closet. 
 The bank manager and a fat lady and her husband. 
 She's not fat, she's pregnant. 
 Get on the floor! 
 Face down! 
 She can't lie on her front because of the baby. 
 I was hoping you'd let her go, keep me instead. 
 And I was hoping you'd do as you're told so I don't have to waste two bullets. 
 Woman : Please! I will do it! 
 Haven't you got enough hostages? 
 Why don't you let her go? 
 Keep your mouth shut. 
 Let's get the lady a chair. 
 What are we, animals? 
 Come on, my love, sit down. 
 You, too. Cozy up. 
 There now, is that better, John Wayne with the crippled hand? 
 Mr. Bank Manager... 
 The vault key. 
 Key? 
 The vault's on a time lock. 
 Which opens in 365 seconds, and requires the key which you wear around your neck. 
 Sorry... 
 I'm getting very tired of being questioned. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why was that young couple here to see you today? 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm not big on repeating myself. 
 They applied for credit. 
 A loan. 
 Ah. Were they successful? 
 Were you successful? 
 Were you able to acquire a loan? 
 What did you want, something for the baby? 
 It's okay, sir, we didn't... 
 What did you need? 
 Furniture, for the nursery. 
 Furn... a bed for the baby and he said no? 
 Manager : No, I didn't have a choice! 
 What's that? 
 Wolf : Do you work? 
 Father-to-be : Yes. Yes, I work. 
 Mm-hmm. Every day? 
 Every day. 
 Please, sir, it is not his fault. 
 Our credit is not good. 
 Now, how can it be that you get to refuse this hardworking young couple the funds to look after their newborn, and somehow they think it's their fault? 
 We have a formula... 
 Scores, which... 
 I'd like you to reconsider, Mr. Bank Manager. 
 Can you do that for me? 
 Can you put aside your formulas and your scores and act like a bloody human being? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 They can have it, anything they want! 
 No. Please... 
 Now, I know you're not predisposed, culturally, to silence, but I need you to understand this is not an audience-participation sport. 
 [Shouting in protest] 
 [Police yell, bark orders] 
 No! No, no, don't shoot! Don't shoot! 
 They put a bomb on me! 
 [Shouts of alarm] 
 Don't shoot! They put a bomb on me! 
 Don't shoot! 
 [Explosion rumbles outside] 
 Am I making myself clear now, John Wayne with the crippled hand? 
 Okay, I want a sniper on that balcony. 
 I want one on that balcony, I want one on that roof. 
 Why did they kill Mr. Stoop? 
 He gave them the vault key. 
 They seem to want a show. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 Now that woke the cops up. 
 I'm monitoring their frequencies. 
 Good. 
 Mr. Pig, prep the doors. 
 Mr. Tiger, head upstairs, if you please. 
 [♪] 
 Right there. 
 You're sure? 
 Yeah. Completely. 
 They in the vault? 
 Yeah, it's the right area. 
 They need to drill? 
 Each camera, one shot. 
 Guy's good. 
 Good? 
 To hit those little cameras, the guy's excellent. 
 Eva : Yeah, but why shoot the camera for a simple robbery when you're wearing a mask? 
 Back that up. 
 He's shooting goofy-foot. 
 What's "goofy-foot?" 
 Well, left-handed, but standing like a righty. 
 You see? 
 The wrong foot's in the front. 
 Nobody shoots like that. 
 They have more than enough time to rob the place and get out. 
 They don't seem to be in a hurry. 
 Bank robberies average six minutes between passing of note to an escape. 
 These guys have been inside for almost 10. 
 Their van is already in police custody, so even if they do come out, they're not going to go anywhere. 
 Unless they don't plan to come out the front door. 
 The first thing you look for when you plan these things is a way out. 
 I mean, wouldn't you? 
 As far as I can tell, they don't have one. 
 Well, yeah, that's maybe exactly what they don't want us to see. 
 How they're going to escape. 
 That's what I mean. 
 Yeah, and Hickman said that they brought a lot of equipment into the bank. 
 I'll pull city records to see if there are any points of hidden egress. 
 Sebastian... Hickman's phone? 
 It's not working. Permanently. 
 What happened to your hand? 
 Accident. 
 Oi! 
 Didn't wolf tell you to shut the hell up? 
 Whatever your boss says. 
 He ain't my boss. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Wolf : Pig? 
 You okay there? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, no worries. 
 I've got it. 
 Do you want me to cripple that hand even more? 
 Don't get yourself in trouble. 
 I've been thinking that maybe my share should be a little bigger. 
 I mean, I did take most of the chances. 
 You've been thinking. 
 Okay, I've got a voice recognition hit on the ringleader. 
 Alex Vaughn. 
 British national. 
 Tommy : Alex Vaughn is out of prison? 
 Paroled two years go. 
 Louis :  You know him, Tommy? 
 Tommy :  He had a drug trafficking crew in the '90s. 
 Says he became radicalized in prison and turned to organized anarchy  and anti-capitalism. 
 He's suspected of a shooting at the G8 summit in 2010. 
 They're anti-capitalist bank robbers who are greedy? 
 Tommy :  No, they're w*nk*rs with guns. 
 [Ground shatters] 
 [Sniffs and groans in disgust] 
 Aw, that is really unpleasant. 
 I used to work on a perfume counter, all I can smell is flowers. 
 Well, maybe you should do the recce? 
 Maybe you should get down there. 
 [Tool whines] 
 Where is my negotiator? 
 Tommy : I don't think it'll matter. 
 We're from the ICC. 
 One of my team members is in there. 
 The cop is one of yours? 
 The w*nk*r in charge is called Alex Vaughn. 
 You can't trust him. 
 This gets better all the time. 
 Do you have a mobile command post of some kind? 
 It's being set up now. Why? 
 Because we shouldn't be standing here. 
 Don't look up, but they have a sniper with them. 
 [In Irish accent] You must be joking. 
 [Sniffs and coughs in disgust] 
 All is good! 
 See? 
 I told you I had it all down. 
 That is why I think it's fair to talk about a larger remuneration. 
 You want to renegotiate. 
 Yeah, exactly, a renegotiation. 
 [Wet slice] 
 Consider that our final offer. 
 Wolf! 
 Suits are here. 
 Showtime. 
 Police! 
 [Police yell, chatter] 
 He wants to talk to you! 
 There is a picture... 
 No, no... ah! Ah! 
 Hey, hey, hey! Be gentle with her! 
 She's pregnant! 
 Be gentle, please. 
 Are you okay? 
 Okay. Be gentle, please. 
 Okay, it's procedure. You're going to be fine, okay? 
 Trust me. 
 Give me the phone. 
 You're going to be fine. 
 This is Chief Helstrom. 
 Wolf :  Oh, yes, we know who you are, Robert. 
 We are very well prepared. You'll be getting a list of demands soon. And in case you're thinking of trying something, what you're looking at is only a small amount of what we brought. We have enough explosive in here  to level three blocks. Am I making myself clear? Why aren't they leaving? Because this isn't a robbery. It isn't? They've been in the vault 20 minutes, and almost every bag they brought with them is right there on the floor. What do you mean? They haven't taken any money. Are there any guns hidden here, anywhere? [Whispering] Guns? Um... There's a security office in the back corner, but I don't know what's in there. Okay, look, I'm a cop. You are? And if the opportunity presents itself, I may need you to divert them. No, he said he would kill everyone... Anika, look, they wired the front door with explosives, and they're walking around here without their masks on. Whatever they're doing, they're not going through it to leave 20 witnesses to talk to sketch artists. Oh, no... Now, I may not get the chance, but if I do, I'll need your help. Can you do that for me, Anika who pretends she isn't the one who's running this place? [Whimpers] Look, I want every man on duty down here now! I was wrong. They're not just w*nk*rs with guns. Nope. They're w*nk*rs with bombs. Yeah. We'll help where we can. PETN is as volatile as it gets. They're definitely not coming out of the front door. I'm thinking maybe I should get up high, try and locate their sniper. Keep my eye on him. All right, good idea. Okay, good. 
 
 [Knocking insistently] You are ready? Ready? Louis did not tell you I was coming. No. My apologies, Rebecca. May we come in? Yeah. We need you to come back to The Hague. Why? May I explain on the way? [Quietly] Damage nothing, but be extremely thorough. Always. They've wired some of the doors with PETN. There's a lot of that  on the open market lately. It's the ordnance of choice for terrorists. Explosives don't help them get away. It only keeps us outside. I'm going through the city planning schematics to see if there is anything nearby they could be accessing for an escape. Listen, if you find anything, let me know, okay? Anne-marie :  - Will do. - Thanks. Officer : One of the hostages is definitely a cop, unit ten. Excuse me... Did you just broadcast that? I'm gone. What are you doing? I said I'd pull out if anything went wrong. What went wrong? I can't say. I need an eye in the sky for this. Well, send the pig. Pig's got his own role to play... Look! I'm sorry, all right? But as soon as everything's ready here, I'm going my own way. [Quietly] Want me to take care of tiger? No, he'll come round. Wolf... I need to tell you something. Not now. Yes, now. Rabbit : We seem to have an uninvited guest. It seems I have... painted myself in a rather dangerous corner. Is there anything I can do? I don't think so. I mean, you haven't told anyone about my hunting for the man who put the bomb in your garage, have you? What does that have to do with this corner you've painted yourself into? I believe I am on the trail of the man who ordered the bomb to be planted. Last week in Russia, I was very close to him. He knew I was coming. And what do you... If there are any bugs, that man will find them. [Sighs] How long have they been listening? I assure you, they will only have been listening for talk of the investigation. They will not be concerned with things of a personal nature. Are you talking about s*x, Michel? Because there are a good many things "of a personal nature" that go on in a marriage that don't involve s*x. But then, you wouldn't know about that, would you? I didn't mean to minimize the intrusion, Rebecca. I remember the first case I brought to you as a prosecutor. It laid the groundwork for establishing rape as a crime of genocide. You took those Tutsi women aside and you told them not to be angry, that anger would hurt their case, that personal anger would cloud every aspect of the trial. Do you remember? I remember. I need you to not take personally what these men did. They listened to us... to us talk, to us hold each other, to us crying. These animals, they took my son away, and then they took my grief. They've left me nothing. Did you find the sniper? No. Doesn't mean he isn't around, though, so tell everyone to stay as unexposed as possible. [Cell phone rings] Yes? I want six Porsches lined up outside, all black. And I want one pilot and a Gulfstream ready to go at Rotterdam Airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Antwerp International, and Gilze-Rijen Airport. Is that clear? You want six Porsches and four planes? Not planes, Gulfstreams. And you have one hour, or I'm turning this bank into an abattoir, starting with the cop we have amongst our hostages. How did they find out? Eva said a uniform broadcast it on the radio. They must be listening. What's that? Security-camera footage. Wish they hadn't disabled them so quickly. I want to see what happened before they entered. Before? Hickman said there were six of them, right? Only five came in. So, one was already inside. I'm not Hickman, but something made him suspicious enough to dial you. Let's see if I can find it. Which one of you is a cop? I'm not big on repeating myself, but this is important, so one more time. Which one of you is a cop? My money's on you, daddy to be. No, I'm a brick-layer. No one else fits the bill. Come on, sport, on your feet. Admit it. No... Admit it! Please! Look at you, copper haircut, copper clothes... There's a copper in those eyes! Admit it! No, it's him! [Whispers] I'm sorry. The cripple? Bloody scraping the barrel for cops, huh? He can't even hold a phone. Did you search him? You told me... You said to get the phones... Get him on his feet and search him. Hmm... What's this? I was working with the Dutch police on a drug ring. That was confiscated from someone this morning. It's police procedure to walk around with evidence in your pocket? It was a seize and destroy operation. Oh, and you just forgot the destroy part? It's not your work, it's your works, baby. Some cop. A crippled junkie. A junkie with stones, I'll give you that, but a junkie nonetheless. No, no, no, he isn't capable of being a problem for us, and I never would have guessed it was him without you. You know what that means, don't you, sweetheart? It means you're a grass! A stoolie! An informant! And there's nothing I hate more than a grass! [Yelps in fear] Get some rope and cut it. You're making a mistake. Pig, give me your gun. I might have something. Eva :  Tell us. There's an old sewer system that runs right under the bank. It hasn't been used for years. It's unstable, but that's probably how they're leaving. Any idea where it comes out? Everywhere. But most of the exits are sealed permanently. I'm narrowing down to any possible escape routes. [Cell phone rings] It's only been 30 minutes! Wolf :  I'm coming out. And I'm not alone, so you'd better not try anything! Yeah. Everyone is here. Helstrom : I want every man and woman on duty down here now! Every man and woman on duty... [Whimpering softly] [Officers shout] Tommy : Tell them not to shoot, chief! That's not the bank robber! That's not Vaughn! Are you sure? The robbers just want to keep everybody busy. Tell your officers to stand down! One bullet could blow us all away. You need to think about what you're doing. Shut up. You've been screwed. I said, shut up. All right, clear back, come back. Everybody, stand down and clear back. Clear back! Answer one question. Why did wolf take your gun? He said he needed your gun, right? Why? To tape. He could have taped any gun to that guy's hand. [Anika cries, muffled] It's okay. Don't move. It's gonna be all right. Yeah? There's no timer... Only a detonation cord. Is it attached to a remote device? Pulling out the cord will defuse the bomb,  but there may be people watching from inside. Watching? For someone to get close. Where's your security guard, your inside man? I'm guessing that fox stabbed him with the knife that she gave you. He's probably dead, right? And you're holding the murder weapon. Okay. I'm going to remove the cord. I want you both still. Your prints are on the guns that are left. Your prints are on the knife. Your prints are on the explosive vest that was on the manager, the pieces that are laying out there. Your prints are on the vests with the people outside right now, the vests that they're wearing. And if you press that button, your prints are gonna be on that detonator, too. They're long gone, and they've dumped this whole thing right in your lap. [Breathing nervously] All of them had gloves on... except you. He was my friend. [Anika yelps] [Sobbing in relief] Hickman :  A lot of great big bags to bring to a robbery... [Typing rapidly] Sebastian! I'm running a suspect through facial recognition. How many are there? Six. Five men, one woman. Did you see a man with one glove? The American? They know he's a cop. It's not a bank robbery. Anne-Marie identified one of the robbers. Her husband is in a prison that sits right on top of the old sewer system less than a mile away. Head for Scheveningen Prison. We're sending you coordinates. We'll explain to you as you're on the way. Go. Go! We'll call you from the road. [Cell phone rings] Berger. Sebastian? Hickman? Are you okay? The bank's secure. I've got one in custody. He surrendered. Anne-marie :  - Surrendered? Yeah, I can be very persuasive. But the doors are wired and ready to blow. Tell whoever's outside, do not come in without a bomb squad. Pretty sure they dug a tunnel. Any idea what's under this bank? Sebastian :  An old sewer line that leads under a nearby prison. We think that's where they are going. I doubt this cell is going to work underground. Do you think you can track it? Any chance i can get you not to go? None. [Groaning in pain] [/i] [Anne-marie]: The female robbers' name is Sheila Ganz. her husband, Konrad Ganz, doing 25 to life, was just transferred there.[/i] The old sewer line goes right underneath that prison. And Ganz was Alex Vaughn's cell mate in the U.K. Fox : It's here. We're under the prison. Give it to me! Okay... Down. [Explosion rumbles] You all right, mate? [Chuckling happily] Hey, hey, plenty of time for that later, eh? Come on. This is the one. Wolf : Hey, keep it down, keep it down. Quiet. Fox : This is it. Wolf : Just keep moving. [Distant, indistinct murmurs] Wolf : Quiet, keep it down. Should be about another 100 yards... Come on... Guys. Hickman's stopped. He's at first Avenue and Holmgren. Tommy :  Yeah, we're only a few blocks from there. Come on, come on, come on. What's he doing? He's still at that same spot, signaling us that something is happening. Eva : Okay, you go to the sewers. I'll stay here. Up already? Don't move! Keep your hands where I can see them. Game's up. You're on your own. Run. Run! Stop! Down! Down! Down! On your knees now! Knees! Far enough! You? Me. How the hell did you get away from pig? I helped him realize what a mess you left him in. I should have killed you when I had the chance. Probably. I'm still going to. Drop the weapon. How did that happen, the hand? Birth defect. [Chuckles] Yeah... No, no, no, they would have never let you be a cop with that. What was it, line of duty? I'm not going to ask again to drop that gun. Were you a junkie before you got hurt, or is that all post-wound? I'm not a junkie. [Chuckling] What the hell was a crippled American cop doing in a bank in the Netherlands? Playing John Wayne. [Fires] All right! All right, all right, all right, you got me. You got me, you got me. That was... pretty impressive. Shot the gun out of his hand. Yeah, well, I was aiming for his head. I told you, I'm not left-handed. Male officer :  Unit four, we have five in custody. Female officer :  We were told there were six. Was he one of them? No. You sure? I'm out of here, Louis. Are you shooting up? I need to know. It's a numbing agent. It's called Lidocaine. I shoot it into my hand. I tried the pills, but you know what? They're just not strong enough. Are you sure? [Chuckles ruefully] Am I sure? So now he's shooting up. Don't worry. My name is on this team, my reputation. I'll take care of it, Dorn. They found three listening devices in your flat. Did you remove them? No, of course, I did not remove them. We will use them to deliver information to Dimitrov that we want him to have. It's the best weapon. Rebecca will never... You think of Rebecca now? Now? You did not call her, Louis. You didn't warn her that I was coming instead of you, that I was coming with a technician, that any of this was happening. Where is she? I-I don't know. Louis : Has anyone seen my wife? Sebastian : She just left. She left? Eva : About 10 minutes ago. You're not coming? I'll pass tonight. Really? Aye. Good for you. [Sighs] [Dialing number] Hello? Hi. Yeah, it's me. I'm fine. I'm fine! Just listen. I need you to, um... I saw Colin today. Aye. I need you to tell him that I saw him. No, he'll know what I mean. All right? And I need you to tell him to call me. I want to speak to him. Can you do that? Love you, ma. All right. [♪] [Cell phone rings]
