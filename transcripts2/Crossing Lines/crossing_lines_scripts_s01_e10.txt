 Hickman : Previously on  Crossing Lines... 
 All of my work, my back-up files, it's all gone. 
 I was hacked! 
 Why are you mad at me? 
 Because I traced them, Eva. 
 The attack came from Italy... 
 From the Italian police. 
 Where is Anne-Marie? 
 We don't know. 
 Eva : She never came in. 
 One of her old colleagues says they're waiting for a report from her on some prisoners. 
 Carl! 
 I have to go, Louis. 
 Someone I know may be in trouble. 
 From Phillip Genovese? 
 At the carnival? 
 How do you know the name Genovese? 
 Louis : That's the guy who hurt you. 
 Leave Shari out of it. 
 She's not a part of it! 
 [Gunshot blasts] 
 Genovese : She is now, Sport. 
 [Thud] 
 This could be stronger than you're used to. 
 Either way, it's going to help take the edge off what you gotta do. 
 [Fires] 
 [Explosion] 
 You and Rebecca have to go underground. 
 Get out of your Amsterdam apartment  move quickly, Louis. 
 Rebecca went back to Paris. 
 Rebecca! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Genovese : You can't kill me... 
 [Gasping for air] 
 Oh, God... 
 [Yelps and groans in pain] 
 [Screams in agony] 
 [Batting at gun, groaning in pain] 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Genovese's voice echoes]  Let me help you... 
 Now, this could be stronger than you're used to, but maybe not. 
 Either way, it's gonna take the edge off what you gotta do. No, no... [Groans groggily] [Shouts in alarm] Shari... Shari? Somebody help me! Hold on, Shari. Stay with me. You're alive, baby. Stay with me. I thought the caravan I grew up in was bad. Seems a little bit more than just bad hoeeping, doesn't it? Like it was done to send a message? What's that? Tarot card. Fortune teller bollocks? The death card. "Let's have some fun." [Helicopter whirs] I need a jet at the warsaw field, fueled up and ready to take me to Le Bourget, and then I need a car when I land, to drive me into the city. And I need a tactical team to go to this apartment as fast as they can. They need to get there as fast as humanly possible. Stay with me. Come on. [Screams in pain] [Whimpering in agony] [Groaning] [Gasping] [Grunting in pain] [Breathing slows, all goes quiet] [Muttering] Shari. Come on, baby. Shh. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on. Hickman! It's me, mate, it's McConnell. Tommy. Hey. Tommy... Who did this to you, mate? What are you doing here, Tommy? The major sent us. This woman needs a hospital now. Yeah. Look, he shot her. She isn't breathing too well. She needs help. This is North Holland Unit Nine. Locate my GPS signal. I'm at a traveling carnival. I don't have an exact address. I need an ambulance and backup. Hickman? Anne-Marie, it's Eva again. We're really worried about you. Can you just give us a call as soon as you can, please? Baci. "Baci?" Mm-hmm. It means "kisses." We say "bussi." Almost the same. Well, at least you have passion in your passionate words. There's hope for you yet. That's every file she has with absolutely no indication where she might be. [Sighing] I know. Well, we're not giving up, are we? Who said anything about giving up? Isn't her old partner in Calais? It's just a couple of hours down there. Maybe her files there have a clue. Okay. Should I try just one more time for good luck? Okay. [Vibrates] [♪] Crossing Lines 01x10 
New Scars Old Wounds, Part 2 
Originally Aired August 18, 2013 Is it Anne-Mano. No. No, it's, uh... I'll-I'll be there in a sec? Everything all right? Yeah, it's just personal. Okay, take your time. Yeah, okay, thanks. Where have you been? You really love me this much? What? Well, you left me 20 messages. I've never had a woman pursue me like this. What did you do to my friend? Are you talking about the German? Yeah, I'm talking about the German. What did you do to my friend? Eva, he tried to illegally access our files again last week. I told you if he did, I would make him pay. Put it all back right now. Eva... No, I'm not joking, Lorenzo. Look, you took all of his work. If you don't return it, I will call your superiors and make an official report, because what you did is a crime. As is accessing our police files, our confidential records. He just got the information he needed for our cases, that's all. Listen to you protect him like a lioness. I was right to be jealous. You are lovers. Put it all back right now, or I will call your superior. Are you sure you want to do that? What do you mean? If this scandal goes public,  his files will be made public, too. His files? There is a great deal of information  about his personal life I'm sure he wants kept secret, especially from the ICC. What kind of information? Ask your friend  which he would prefer... Losing his files, or his secrets going public. [Stabs tire, air hissing] [Air hissing] Son of a bitch... garbage guy? Is this you? How'd you free yourself from your girl, man? Ain't no way you dragged her all this way. That's far enough. Well done. Damn, that's well done, it really is. Drop that gun, or I will shoot you right now. Unless I'm crazy, that's the piece that I left for you, right? So it's got one shot in it. Drop it now! You think by getting louder, it's gonna improve your situation? Listen, I have lots of bullets. You have one. Oh, and you're leaning, so judging from that, you sampled some of that dope I left for you, huh? So you're single-shooting left handed, and you're riding that horse. Odds are really in my favour, Garbage. And you know what? That doesn't even include Butchy right there with the Mac-10. I'll count to three. One... Butchy, Mac-10. Two... You brought this on yourself. Kill him, Butch! [Shots blast] Tommy, give me your ankle gun. You really suck at teamwork, man. She personally wanted to drop off the women at a shelter she trusted. Then she said she would go back to The Hague and send reports from there. That's the last you saw of her? Standing right where you are. She never came back to our offices, though. That's not the behaviour of the Detective Sergeant San I worked for. Yeah, not what we've come to expect either. What kind of mood was she in? I mean, she looked worried or something? No, she was... just Anne-Marie, you know? A little awkward, a lot efficient. Her information on the trafficked women was very good. They were exactly where her source had said they would be. Do we have any information on this source? No, she always kept that to herself. She didn't even leave any records behind in Lyon. She took all her files with her to The Hague. Yeah, we went through all of them. Nothing. Listen, she seemed good, yes? She made a nice arrest, two traffickers, and she rescued four girls. Exactly what she loved to do. Last I saw her, she was so happy. [Power whirs to life] [Gunshots blast] [Fires, bullet ricochets] That's your one! [Firing] [Glass shatters] I see your little pal's given you a gun. A five-round snubby? Two down. Game on! [Stumbles, clattering] Damn! [Fires] That's three! Two left! [Shoots] [Returns fire] You're not a very good shot, Carl. Why is that? Drop it. [Blow thuds heavily] Take that, big fella, huh? [Shoots] [Gun clicks uselessly] That's five, garbage boy. You're empty. You're done. [Blows thud] [Stuffed animals squeak] [Squeaking] [Spits] [Whistles, taunting] Where you going, man? [Groans in pain] Police! That's enough. Shoot him! Shoot him, Seeger! Police! He knows who you are, just bloody shoot him! [Fires] [Groans in pain] Are you all right? Aye. Just wearing him out, you know. "Shoot him, shoot him!" It was pretty high-pitched for someone who's wearing him out. Is that girl all right? Yeah, the ambulance is taking care of her. There's more backup on the way. Seeger : Where's Hickman? Come on... we both knew it was going to end this way. I mean... you don't want to live anymore anyway, right? I mean, you're a cop... Who can't even hold a gun. I might as well have just cut your balls off. [Fires] Hickman. You all right. He's not dead. Cuff him! Now! [Sobbing desperately] Right now! All right, she's got him, she's got him. She's cuffing him, all right? The adrenaline's pumping, I can't... What do you mean, man? When the ambulance gets here, you tell them that I think I did... I think I did heroin. What? Yeah, I think a large... a large dose. It might be lethal. You tell them... Tommy... Tommy, they gotta counter it, you tell them to give me... [Gasping] I need narcan! Okay, man, all right... Hickman, hold on! No sign of him? None. His car is in the garage, though. So he was here. What was he working on? Louis? No, this wasn't him. I'm sorry? This was something I was working on. Something that appears to be out of control. Would you care to explain? No, not to you. When Louis was still with the 36, he was working on a very large drug case. There were some arrests? Not that I... Yes. Heroin poppies from Afghanistan. There were maybe 30 arrests made. You know the investigation very well? I didn't work on it. Is there someone around who did? Doesn't work in the field anymore. Well, where can I find him? Her. Uh... At the office. She was made a clerk not long after. Remember the first time you tried to kiss me? I turned away. I wanted you so bad, but... this... this... I'm so sorry. Everything, every woman I ever get close to... gets hurt. Please get better. Get better and forgive me. There he is. You feeling better? Couldn't feel too much worse. Looks like you could say the same. Ah, no worries. I've got a hard head. Just like him. Has he woken up yet? Not a peep. You gave him a good concussion. .45'll do that. Wanna tell me who he is? He runs a trafficking ring. Drugs? People... Kids. b*st*rd. They used the carnival. Snatch a kid in one area, put him through the carnie network, kid's out of the country in a day. What country? All over. Europe... Asia... North America. He's who did this. Should have killed him. It's good that he lived. I got a lot of questions for him. I'm trying to update the major, but I can't get ahold of him. Don't bother, I quit yesterday. Yeah, but I didn't. And I shot a bloke and beat up another one. Beat him up? Yeah, well, until she came in and shot him in the knee. Still, that's gonna mean paperwork somewhere down the line. Well, good luck with that. It's weird, though. First, Anne-Marie, now the major. No word on her? No. Eva and Sebastian went through all her files, then they went to Calais. I just talked to them, but... nothing. They're on their way back now. Can I ask you something? Of course. What kind of things were in your files? Excuse me? I mean, not the scangen, but you told me that you also have personal stuff, too. Very. Like what? Well, I think the word "personal" sums it up nicely. Okay, sorry. I was just curious. I'm a woman. [Sighing] Aw, what the hell? This officer has quite an impressive record. There were also problems. Why was she removed from the field? s*x. Excuse me? I had an affair with a superior. She was made a clerk to safe the unit embarrassment. And what happened to the superior? He was promoted. Well, be that as it may, I need your help. My help? I'm from the ICC, and I'm looking for a man who may be in grave danger, a man with whom you worked at one time. Who? Louis Daniel. He and his wife appear to be missing. Appear to be? They both may be in trouble, or she is missing, and he's trying to find her, or they're both in hiding somewhere, but I don't believe I have the luxury of waiting to find out. Who would be after him? A man that you apparently helped him with an investigation of. Alexander Dimitrov? Exactly. Then you're right. He's in a lot of trouble. Wow, it's a bad accident, huh? It's pretty burned up. Excuse me. What's wrong? This car. It could be Anne-Marie's. 
 
 [Monitors beeping steadily] [Genovese groans] Over here. I'm probably the one in the middle. I can't... I'm-I'm numb up here. Did... Did you shoot me in the head? And I lived? You can't kill me. My old partners in New York, they're putting together the extradition papers right now. You'll be there end of the week. You have any idea the minimums you're gonna do for child abduction and trafficking? And trust me, upstate New York is not the place a short eyes like you wants to do time. I ain't no short eyes. I never touched those kids. I found them on the street... Do you think anybody gives a crap about that distinction? When you're sentenced, and you take that walk from the defendant's table to the tombs... the last thing that you're gonna see before you go into the tank will be me... Smiling, from ear to ear. By the way, I thought about just killing you. But what could be worse than leaving you to live the life you're going to live? We arrested 28 members of the gang, most of them small players. The highest we got was mid-level distribution. Why no higher? Dimitrov killed everyone above them. Everyone? Within 24 hours. The entire operation. Traffickers, importers, exporters. From Paris, to Afghanistan, to Russia. Dozens of people. He sacrificed them all to keep us as far from him as possible. Is that unusual? Not for him. So this has happened before? This? A drug ring connected to him has been broken up? It happens all the time. Then why? Why has he gone after Louis so personally? Mr. Dorn? Dorn. Just Dorn. He's on the phone for you. Louis? Dimitrov. In Commissaire Laveaux's office. When did this accident happen? Two nights ago. Another motorist noticed a fire below the embankment and called it in. By the time I got here, the fire brigade had the flames all out. Where's the driver? There was a body. It was burnt badly. Was that a female? I couldn't honestly even tell you that. Did you take the license plates? There were none. And the driver's identification burnt up. The body is still unidentified. Sebastian : There are footprints! I can't tell for sure, but it looks like someone walked away. There was a body, Sebastian. Not necessarily hers. Dammit, if I had my equipment, we could use it to follow the traces. Is this the phone? We're almost ready to trap and trace that call. He called me. You think he cares about being traced? Still, I think we'd better trace it. As long as he has Rebecca and Louis, he has the upper hand. No one is to do anything that might jeopardize them. You have no authority here. That may be so, but I promise you I am not the man you want as an enemy. We won't need to trace the call anyway. What? He wants a meeting. How do you know... Why else would he call, sir? This is a show he's putting on. Now, if you'll take your hand away, I will indulge him. [Music pounding] This is Dorn. I've wanted for quite some time to talk to you. You might have called my office. I'm in the telephone book. I needed to really get your attention first. Then you have it... fully. The address is popping up on inspector Claire's cell phone now. [Cell phone beeps] When? One hour. Did you know he had your cell number? No. It's more show. He wants to meet me in an hour. Would you like someone to come with you, sir? No, thank you. But I would appreciate a backup team nearby. Do you think you might arrange that, Commissaire? I'll see who I can spare. Thank you. Thank you, Moreau. So, what else happened? About? Well, a s*x scandal in a Parisian police unit doesn't usually raise an eyebrow. When Commissaire Laveaux took over, he thought everything came with the job. Everything? Including me. I stabbed his hand with a letter opener the first time he reached for me. So... The affair that you had was with the former Commissaire? Be careful, sir. I will be. Thank you. Have you told the major? No, I can't get ahold of him either. [Sighs] All right, just...  stay there until you hear from... I don't know, someone. What's up? That was Eva. Her and Sebastian found a wreck from two days ago, a burned up car. And? She's sure it's Anne-Marie's. Where was the accident? Outside South Holland, not far from... What is it? There's a body in the north Holland morgue, an unidentified female from an accident burned beyond identification. She's been there two days. Oh, God... Tommy, wait... No! If it is her, I'm not leaving her there alone any longer! Just wait. Arabela, stay with Genovese. I'll be back soon as I can. My boss is on his way. I'll be fine. He's dangerous. Never forget that. Go. Dammit, the major isn't answering either. Didn't he say where he was going? No. He just told Tommy to watch after Hickman, and asked us to follow up with Anne-Marie, and then he disappeared. A scan of the area would give us a much better idea of what happened. Sebastian... What? I have something to tell you. What? Umm... I told my old unit in Rome to do a cyber security check. No... No, but I did it because I really thought they needed to know how easy it was to get into. I only got into static databases, criminal records. I know. I told them that. They barely even have firewalls on those things, Eva. There was nothing vital. I would never go into anything top secret or critical, even if I could. I know, it's just... It wasn't you. I just wanted them to be careful, and I thought, if it's so easy for you to get into, then who else could do the same thing? And it was my old... country. My... How could you do this to me? I really didn't want to hurt you. I was only trying to... You lied to me for months! I did it because... God... everything I ever worked on. Gone. No. I can get it all back. I have some personal effects of the victim if you want to examine them. We've taken DNA samples and dental impressions, but without something to compare them to, it's going to be difficult. If it's who we think it is, her mother is a physician in France. We'll need to have her provide samples as well. Sure. Could we have a moment of privacy? Yes, of course. I was here... God, was it only yesterday? I was this close to her. Come on. We don't know if it's her. "Dear diary... Today, I saw my first real bad guy." No offense, but you're a detective from North Holland, right? Big day is having some farmer get overly friendly with his barnyard companions, right? Meeting me, that's gotta be a pretty big trip for you, huh, beautiful? Ever stepped on a piece of dog crap? Walking in the park or something? At the time, it seems like a really big deal. "What am I going to do? I have dog crap on my shoe. How terrible." But then you wash it away, and an hour later, you've forgotten it even happened. I feel like you're going to be that for me. You seem like a really big deal now, but when you're convicted and back in America, you'll be the piece of dog crap I once washed off the bottom of my shoe. Commander. Inspector Seeger. Just finishing off my notes for the arrest report. So, everything's all right in here, huh? Perfect. Absolutely perfect. [Music pounding] This way. Upstairs. [Sighs heavily] If you come back down... "If" I come back down? Maybe I could dance myself again for you. Well, in that case, I will be sure to make it back down. It was my ex-partner. He is responsible for taking your information and putting a virus in your machines. But you can get the files back? He says it's up to you. Either you lose your files, or he makes them public. Public? God... You can have it all back again. What do you want to do? Call him. If it helps find Anne-Marie, tell him I don't give a damn what he does with the files. Are you sure? Michel Lechnya Dorn. Sit with me. Not if I am surrounded. You're worried about a pistol? I could have had this entire place incinerated the moment I knew you were here. The difference between us is you didn't. The only reason I didn't is because you and I have something to deal with first. Even so, there are a great many other differences between us. [Snaps fingers] This thing with Louis Daniel has gone far enough. Louis Daniel is a fly. Less. But you bombed his vacation home. You tried to kill him, did kill his child. Did I? Are you saying that you did not plant that bomb? Please. Of course we did. What is interesting is your assessment of targets. I mean, he wasn't even home at the time, was he? But why her? Because you and that bitch put my brother-in-law in prison. Rebecca was the target all along. It was an end. Who is your brother-in-law? Anatoly Bardov. Bardov? Yes. I was married to his sister. He is a war criminal. A rapist, a murderer, a soulless monster. Why is one side deemed criminal... Monsters as you say... And the other side's crimes swept away? Your nation attacked the Chechen people without provocation. We were soldiers. Our leaders sent us to fight, we fought. "Just following orders" is not good enough anymore. Bardov raped and butchered a group of 15-year-old and 16-year-old girls. No one ever raped them. That was a lie. And you called them "girls"? They were snipers. They killed dozens of our men. We found them with their rifles, their scopes. There was a trial... They murdered my wife and children. Where is the justice for that? What Chechen dog stood trial for that? Do you know the Budyonnovsk Hospital hostage crisis? Yes. 1500 hostages, all civilians, 123 were murdered. The dead included my Kristina, Bardov's sister, and both of my girls. They were 8 and 7, and they weren't soldiers. So you'll forgive me for not weeping for your teenage chechen snipers. What do you want? A deal. If you ever want to see the Daniels alive again, I want my brother-in-law brought here. What? I want to take him home. How am I supposed to do that? You have signed him out for questioning 11 times since he was imprisoned. They let you take him every time. Alone. [Chuckles] You are a legend, Dorn. So, sign him out again, only, this time, bring him here. You have 24 hours. All right, I'm going to go to the office and look through Anne-Marie's things. For? An address, a phone number. We need to call her mother. And if you can't find any contact info in her desk? Oh, God, there's got to be something around there somewhere. I'll go through Louis' files. Right. What do you need me to do? Go to the hospital. Check on Genovese. Come on. Come on... [Computer beeping] Yes. It's working. [Scanner beeping] Eva, look. I told you. Someone walked away. Someone with smaller feet, and not in boots. She could be out there somewhere? The accident happened two days ago. And it's getting dark, and it's really starting to snow now. Okay, come on, we'd better hurry up. Where's the guard? Arabela? Arabela! Arabela... [Groans groggily] What happened? It was my boss. He attacked me. He helped him. I'm sorry, Tommy. Genovese's gone. [Cell phone rings] Dorn? I need your help, Hickman. Come again? I need you and the team in Paris  as quickly as you possibly can, at the headquarters of the 36. I quit yesterday! Louis is in trouble. What kind of trouble? There is every possibility  that he will be dead by tomorrow afternoon. I'll call the team. Thank you. Anne-Marie... [Cell phone rings] Hickman. Genovese :  Hey, garbage boy... Guess who's out of the hospital. I can't wait for round two. [Cackling] Sir? Can we do anything? I've spent my entire life tracking and capturing war criminals. Despots, tyrants, some of the worst mass murderers in the history of mankind. Men who have not dozens, but thousands of victims on their ledger sheets. Hundreds of thousands. Men who are steeped in the greatest agonies one can imagine. [Desperate pounding on door] Rebecca knows. Louis knows. [Frantic pounding on door] They must know. Dimitrov must know... [Desperate pounding] That regardless of what it means for them, for me... I can never allow one of them to be set free. I can't. I won't. Never.
