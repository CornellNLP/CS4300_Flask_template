 Good work, boys. 
 Antonio! Antonio! Look at me. 
 You have to do like this. 
 Yes, Father. 
 The sun is going down. 
 We should get San Pietro in the water. 
 Come on, boys. 
 My good people, I give you San Pietro. 
 It is on this day we commence the festival to celebrate the loving holiness he brought to this land... of great fishermen. 
 Viva! Viva! 
 Che bei fuochi d'artificio. 
 Eva! 
 Ma sei tu! 
 Sì. 
 Che bello! 
 Come stai? 
 Bene. 
 I didn't know if you were going to make it. 
 Have I ever missed the festival? 
 I know how busy you have been with your new position. 
 I've been following all of your adventures. 
 Well, "adventures" is not really the right word. 
 But, yeah, I guess it's nice to do some good. 
 Some good? You do a lot of good. 
 If my brother could see you now. 
 I know he would be so proud. 
 I don't think my father would have liked my life choice. 
 He chose the life he did. 
 Doesn't mean he didn't want different for you. 
 Help! There is a body in the water! 
 Quick! 
 Just over there. 
 Oh my God! 
 Antonio, Antonio, don't look. Stay back, all of you boys! 
 Don't look! Stay back! 
 Probably a fisherman who fell overboard somewhere. 
 I'm sorry the children had to see it. 
 So am I. 
 We'll know more once we can I.D. the body but... that won't be easy. 
 I would say, he has been in the water at least a week, maybe more. 
 Look like, uh, a titanium femur. 
 Yes, I think it may be. 
 I took a picture of the serial number. 
 I may have a person who might be able to identify this body. 
 Eva. 
 I need you to run something for me. 
 Well, hello to you too. 
 You call and expect me to drop everything. 
 Are you busy? 
 No, not really. What do you need? 
 A body washed ashore during a festival I'm attending. 
 And the victim has what looks like, titanium femur I guess. 
 Give me the serial number. 
 The serial number is Hotel, Kilo, 1, 2, 4. 
 Ok, it's running. 
 What's the festival? 
 Celebrating local fishing. I'm in Italy. I'm in Ostia. 
 My uncle is a priest here. 
 A priest? 
 Yeah. 
 It's my father's brother. Can you believe it? 
 Bet they had some interesting discussions. 
 Ah, well, you don't know the half of it. 
 Got a hit. 
 What is it? 
 Implanted two years ago. 
 Juan Paolo of Teruel, Spain. 
 Thanks, Sebastian. 
 Sergeant Vittoria? 
 We've got it: Juan Paolo, de Teruel, Spain. 
 Well, that was fast. 
 Well, that's the way we do it. 
 Grande. 
 This is not the way I envisioned our festival. 
 Yeah, a body... 
 I have done so many funerals before, but this is... 
 I know. 
 This is different. 
 I've seen far too many. 
 Come back with me. 
 At least we can eat something together. 
 I don't know, I'm not really hungry, Uncle. 
 Eva... 
 I don't see you enough. 
 And I don't want this to be the memory I have until the next time. 
 I don't want it to be the memory either. 
 Ok, let's have something to eat. 
 But I need to go back soon to the ICC, I can't be long. 
 I'll take whatever time I can get. 
 Earlier tonight in Ostia, Italy... a decomposed body washed ashore during the town's festival Di Antonio. 
 Despite the decomposition... 
 Italian police were able to identify the body, as that of Juan Paolo of Teruel, Spain. 
 Sergeant Vittoria. 
 Have you checked the throat? 
 Excuse me? 
 The body that was pulled out of the water. 
 Have you checked in the throat? 
 Who is this? 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 A shell? 
 That's what the medical examiner found... lodged in the throat. 
 It's a bivalve mollusk. 
 A scallop. 
 They're very common in the Mediterranean Sea. 
 Well, this was placed there post-mortem. 
 I'm going to assist on the investigation. 
 I do agree, it's suspicious. 
 But a single drowned body is not exactly our jurisdiction. 
 I know, Major, but this is a town close to where I grew up. 
 I know a lot of people there. It's really personal for me. 
 The question is, how the hell this guy got Eva's number? 
 That's the question to answer. 
 The number was blocked. 
 The call came from Tarragona, the landline registered to a Mateo Cruz. 
 He's a reporter? 
 Barely. 
 He writes the travel section for the "Noticias Nacionales", a Tarragona newspaper. 
 Could be how he got the number. 
 Newspapers pay for access to reverse directories. 
 I will notify the Spanish authorities. This is information they are going to need. 
 To be a suspect, Louis. 
 Well, I can notify them from here too. 
 This started in Italy, I'm still an Italian sergeant, Major. 
 I'm sorry, but I don't need your permission to do this. 
 Okay, but I'm sending Arabela and Tommy to meet you there. 
 I don't need any help. 
 It's not about need. 
 This is team, Eva. 
 All right, Sir. 
 Who are you? 
 What's going on? 
 Inspector Jefe, what's this? 
 Are you Mateo Cruz? 
 Yes. 
 Well, you're under arrest. 
 What for? 
 Suspicion of murder. 
 I... I didn't kill anyone. 
 Then how do you know about the shell in the victim's throat? 
 Ladies, you're gonna want to see this. 
 Jackpot, mate. 
 Please, just let me explain. 
 You can explain this to Inspector Campo when he gets you back to the police station. 
 Let's go have a chat, Mateo. Come... 
 I already told him. 
 What? 
 I already told him everything. 
 Did you? 
 They won't listen. 
 That's why I called you. 
 Maybe you could help. 
 Help? With what? 
 This, the case. 
 Someone's killing young men. 
 By the looks of it, you are, mate. 
 Let him talk. 
 Seriously? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it won't hurt to listen for five minutes. 
 Tell us. Talk, please. 
 Ok. 
 Last year, when I was in San Sebastián... 
 I heard about a few missing tourists. 
 Then, when I work the assignment in Tarragona... 
 I found out there were a few more. 
 People there talk about it like it was a legend... but I decided to look into it. 
 When the men were found at different places along the Mediterranean... 
 I was able to get a hold of the autopsies. 
 They were all classified as accidental. So, it wasn't hard. 
 And that's when I noticed the shells being found in the throats. 
 And... and no one found this suspicious? 
 Por favor, more than 1500 people a year drown in the Mediterranean. 
 Finding shells or other sea creatures on the body, is not exactly uncommon. 
 Oh yes, but the fact it was the same shell... can be curious. 
 So I took the information to my boss, who told me that it wasn't my job. 
 Then, I went to the police, who told me they'd look into it... but I could tell, they looked at me like some... conspiracy theorist. 
 And then yesterday, I saw the body of Juan Paolo found in Italy. 
 And you saw me. 
 Yeah. 
 I did a story on your team a few months ago, a gambling scandal. 
 That wasn't true. 
 I'm sure it wasn't. 
 But I did some research, and you guys are able to resolve amazing things. 
 So I thought maybe... you could help. 
 What do you think? 
 This is all speculations. 
 Technically, there's no evidence that homicides have been committed. 
 And you? 
 There's almost a dozen missing persons... if he's telling the truth, then we have a prolific serial killer on our hands. 
 Get him dressed. I need him to come with us. 
 No. 
 Senora, that's not possible. 
 Why not? 
 This man has cost an investigation to be started. 
 Of course you can talk to him from his cell, at the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, ok? 
 Perfect, then. 
 I did not do anything. 
 I'm gonna go with him. 
 Eva... 
 We can't ignore this. 
 Eva, are you sure his alibi stands up? 
 Well, of the six abductions we can connect to this case, travel records show he wasn't even in Spain for three of them. 
 And in the other three cases, he was at home in Tarragona. 
 I believe him, Major. 
 It's not enough of a reason. 
 That's not completely true. 
 I really believe he just stumbled on it. 
 And anyway, there's no evidence to hold him here, so... the Spanish police's gonna let him go. 
 At the moment, whether he did it or not, is not the concern, Eva. 
 You all know that the team has to be invited in on an investigation. 
 Is there even an investigation ongoing here? 
 But, sir, if he is right, we at least owe it to the victims to look into it. 
 I'm with Dorn. This is just some nut job with too much time on his hands. 
 If we can prove something is going on, we will bring it into the Court. 
 You're going to look into it. 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 I grant the team a modicum of latitude, Louis. 
 But until there's actual evidence, it will be a very sort leash. 
 All right? 
 Ok. 
 Hickman. 
 Ok, Eva. This is your show now. But as Dorn said... you need to watch our boundaries until we can get sufficient evidence. 
 Yes, sir. 
 You can use my villa. 
 I've got all the information there. 
 It's not a bad idea. 
 Yeah. Contact me when you get there. 
 And Eva? 
 Yes, Major? 
 Don't make me regret this. 
 I won't. 
 You're really gonna let a member of the press in on an investigation? 
 He's done months of work on this. 
 Could be an asset to us. 
 And? 
 And after Sebastian's problem in the news... it would not hurt this team to get a little good press. 
 It's your call. 
 Yes. 
 But in my dealings with them... journalists are not to be trusted. 
 Especially when they come with good intentions. 
 Thank you for doing this. 
 It's not for you, it's for them. 
 I just meant, thank you for believing me. 
 Eva believes you. 
 I'm operating on a very thinly veiled suspicion. 
 Ok, so... where do we start? 
 These are drownings, I'd say, we start in the water. 
 All right, I've got all the information digitized to you. 
 Ok, Sebastian, it's not about where the bodies were found, but where they went into the water. 
 All right. 
 I'll take where each body was found along points in the Mediterranean... calculate the estimated time of death, and chart current patterns along the water. 
 I can get it down to a stretch of Spanish coastline... between Valencia and Barcelona. 
 That's 350 kms. 
 There's way too many variables to get it exact: marine life, boat activity... 
 Well, it's a start. 
 Seeger. 
 This is Doctor De Luca from the Ostia morgue. 
 Yes? 
 I just concluded the autopsy from the victim of last night. 
 There seems to be something... 
 ... odd. 
 More odd than the shell being found stuffed in her throat? 
 Not odd like that, "curious" would be a better word. 
 Although the body was soaked with salt water from the Mediterranean... 
 I found a trace amount of fresh water in her lungs. 
 So, he was drowned somewhere else? 
 That would be my finding, yes. 
 Ok. 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 Fresh water was found in the lungs. 
 Which means the killer could have drowned them anywhere inland, and then... dumped them in the Mediterranean. 
 There's more than 1800 rivers in Spain. 
 That just made this a little more difficult. 
 Louis. 
 The Court has authorized further investigation as long as the Spanish approve. 
 Thanks, Dorn. But you could have called. 
 You're using a journalist as the source. 
 I believe he can be helpful. 
 He's a journalist. 
 We can't afford any more bad press, Louis. 
 I know. 
 The Ostia morgue are running tests on the water found in the lungs. 
 They're trying to pinpoint the lake or river it may have come from. 
 I wouldn't hold my breath though, no pun intended. 
 Dorn was able to get authorization as long as we get Spanish approval. 
 That's not gonna be easy. 
 Well, I'm kinda doubting how much the water will give us. 
 We should start looking at victimology. 
 I could run backgrounds on the victims. 
 Yeah. 
 I've done that already. 
 Most of them were here alone on holiday. 
 Backpackers hiking across Europe. 
 But that's where the connection seemingly stopped. 
 Sebastian can run a more thorough search. Until then... 
 Maybe it's not the people, but the places. 
 According to Mateo's research, two most frequent abduction sites is Saint-Jean Pied de Port in France, and Roncesvalles in Spain. 
 Wait for the lab results on the water, see why these places were chosen. 
 You guys check out Roncesvalles, Hickman and Sebastian will go to France. 
 And we'll meet you in Tarragona when I can. Ok? 
 I can tell why you wanna spend holiday here, it's so beautiful. 
 Not quite as beautiful as you, but it has its moments. 
 Seriously? 
 What? 
 Let's keep it in our pants, mate. We're on this wild goose chase 'cause of you. 
 Goose chase? 
 Never mind. 
 I've been here many times. 
 Perks of being a travel journalist. 
 Blogger. 
 Roncesvalles has a rich history. 
 This is where Charlemagne was defeated in 778, in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. 
 La morte di Rolando. 
 Nothing's more attractive in a woman than intelligence. 
 What the hell, Tommy? 
 Look, while you two are making goo-goo eyes at each other, I've got my eyes on this case. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 That. 
 So this the same kind of shell found in our bloke's throat? 
 Yeah. 
 Of course. 
 How could I not have seen it? 
 Do you have any idea what they're talking about? 
 Hi, any use? 
 Eva? 
 No we haven't found anything yet. 
 We may have. 
 Look around you. 
 Do you see any scallop shells on rocks or anything? 
 Now that you mention it, we're at the last place one of the victim's was seen. 
 And, we're looking at the shell logo right now. 
 And they're everywhere in the city. 
 Right. 
 Meet us in Spain. 
 I might know how he's choosing his victims. 
 You guys are gonna fill us in on your little secret? 
 He might be picking off his victims on the way of Saint James. 
 Camino de Santiago. 
 Yeah, Santiago de Compostela. 
 Yeah. 
 I know the place. 
 My father used to take me on the pilgrimage there when I was a little girl. 
 Yeah, its two most popular starting points are in Saint-Jean Pied de Port and Roncesvalles. 
 You know, the logo for the trip is the scallop shell stuck in the victims' throat. 
 So basically, we're looking for a religious nut along the road filled with religious people? 
 Like looking for a specific needle among a stack of needles. 
 And the way's thousands of kilometers long. 
 If he's sticking to a pattern... he's already looking for the next victim. 
 And no way to narrow where he's gonna go next. 
 I'm sorry, that's... all I have. 
 I wasn't exactly expecting company. 
 Well, I had it worse I guess. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, make yourself... at home. Please. 
 Which one do you know? 
 Excuse me? 
 This is not just about a story, is it? 
 You're too invested. 
 I just want justice. My brother. Oscar. I'm... I'm sorry, Mateo, I... 
 No, no, please, don't. Don't be. 
 We... really lost him a long time ago. Drugs. I hadn't talked to him in years, until he called me from Le Buis, in France. He told me he'd found a new way. I didn't know he meant, "The Way". Then the Sicilian police called. Told me he'd drowned. 
 And that's when you started investigating? 
 I've never really been there for him. It was an embarrassment for me, the family. He was sick, and we did nothing. 
 I know the pain of losing your family. 
 And the feeling.. helpless. 
 Both of my parents were murdered. It's why I do what I do. 
 
 
 
 That was the Ostia morgue. They were not able to find anything in the trace water sample. 
 If we can't figure out why this guy's drowning his victims, then... 
 What if we are looking at it wrong? 
 There were trace amounts of fresh water in the lungs, but... the body had been in the heavily salted Mediterranean, for what, days? 
 What if the body wasn't dumped into the sea? 
 But rather floated into it. 
 Know how many rivers flow in the Mediterranean? 
 Not as many as you'd think. 
 Three main ones are Po, Rhône and Ebro. 
 Ebro's in Spain, but it's almost a thousand kilometers long. 
 Inspector Chief Campo, por favor. 
 What are you thinking about? 
 If he's sticking to a pattern... maybe there's a body floating towards the Mediterranean as we speak. 
 Yes. This is Major Daniel from the ICC. 
 I assume you received our authorization... from the Criminal Court. 
 And then we need a favor of you, and your men. 
 Near Tortosa, Spain Buenos días. 
 Inspector Campo, how are you? 
 Fine, thanks. You? 
 Good, good. 
 My men found a body. 
 How can we be sure this is even connected? 
 Excuse me, can I borrow your tweezers? 
 Of course. 
 Gracias. 
 Can you please follow me? 
 Does this answer your question? 
 We will transport the body to the morgue, in Zaragoza. 
 It's the first time we have a fresh body. 
 There could be clues that washed away with the others. 
 I will tell Eva to go to the morgue. 
 I'll meet her there. 
 I will too. 
 Never heard you volunteer for a morgue run. 
 I just don't trust that tosser. 
 He's been all over Eva since we took the case. 
 You're worried that he's bothering her, or that's it's working? 
 The church of San Bartolomé. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Bartolomé was one of the apostles of Christ. 
 He even witnessed the Ascensión. 
 This is landmark number 9 on this map I have. 
 You're doing the Camino too? 
 It's my twentieth time. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah, it's... 
 My mother used to take us in it every summer when I was a boy. 
 Lucky you. 
 Yeah, lucky. 
 Are you Catholic? 
 Not really religious. 
 I'm taking a cultural studies class at my university, and... this seemed like a pretty ace way to spend my summer. 
 I'm Pedro. 
 Walter. 
 Well, since this is your first time, you must let me buy you a drink in this great tavern in town. 
 Well, it has been a long walk. 
 Why not? 
 Great. 
 I've never actually waited for an autopsy before. 
 Are they usually this long? 
 I'm sure they can take longer. 
 If it wasn't for you, Campo wouldn't have ordered it immediately. 
 Lucky you met me then. 
 Not so lucky for the dead bloke. 
 I didn't mean... 
 I'm gonna go get a coffee. 
 I'm pretty hungry too. 
 Would you like anything? 
 No, thanks. 
 I'll wait here. 
 Ok. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Listen, I just want you to know we are on the same team. 
 What team is that, mate? 
 Justice. 
 Really? 
 This isn't just about you getting a good story for your paper? 
 Maybe you just like the scenery. 
 Do you mean Eva? 
 If there is something going on between you two... I didn't know. 
 Just because I don't like you, doesn't mean I'm interested in Eva. 
 That's good to know. 
 They found something. 
 In the initial examination, I was able to locate a puncture wound on the victim's neck. 
 Well, drowning someone isn't easy. 
 He's probably drugging them. 
 Exactly. 
 So we ran a toxicology screen... and we were able to find a massive amount of ketamine in his system. 
 Ketamine, like the horse drug? 
 Damn, I wanted to be in Burgos by now. 
 Since it's my fault you're behind, why don't you let me give you a lift. 
 You're driving? Isn't that cheating? 
 I said it was my twentieth time. 
 I've earned the right to cheat. 
 But I won't tell on you. 
 You know, why the hell not? 
 This is my car. 
 It's open, get in. 
 Ketamine? 
 It's a horse tranquilizer mostly. 
 It's also a narcotic. 
 And this guy's injecting it. 
 Well, if it's so easy for him to have access to injectable ketamine, he might be a vet. 
 Or works around one. A tech or a receptionist. 
 Sebastian? 
 There's a lot. I need something to narrow it down. 
 Do you have any reports of missing ketamine? 
 No. 
 Veterinarians aren't regulated like doctors or hospitals. 
 A vet can basically order as much as he wants. 
 What about a spike in ketamine orders? 
 Mateo, in your estimation... 
 When was the first murder committed? 
 About a year ago. 
 There are three veterinarians in the area. 
 In Alagón, Estella and Tafalla. 
 We're about 20 minutes outside of Alagón. 
 We will take the other two. 
 What's the office address? 
 It's not an office. 
 It's a residential address. A farmhouse. 
 Ok, let's go. 
 What... 
 You're safe. 
 Then why am I tied up? 
 I have to get my mother. 
 She's gonna be here really soon. 
 She just likes to see the people I baptize. 
 Baptize? 
 Every sinner needs to be absolved. 
 I'm not... I didn't sin. 
 I seem to remember you said you weren't very religious. 
 That doesn't mean I'm a sinner. 
 Yes. 
 Yes it does. 
 Ok, copy. 
 They did not find anything in Estella. 
 There's a truck in the driveway and some lights are on. 
 Someone's home. 
 Shall we wait for the others? 
 They're still miles away. 
 We can handle a suspect interview with... 
 Doctor Javier Almora. 
 He's 60. 
 Hey, a 60 year-old veterinarian. 
 What's the plan? 
 The plan? 
 Yeah. 
 The plan is we're gonna go and interview this suspect, and you're gonna wait in the car. Here, crack a window if it gets stuffy. 
 No, wait. 
 You cannot just cut me out now. 
 What if this is the guy? 
 Probably this is not the guy, Mateo. 
 And if he is, it's better for you to wait here anyway. 
 But... 
 You're not a cop, I'm sorry. 
 You've got to wait here, ok? 
 So, what's your problem with him? 
 Who, Don Juan back there? 
 If you give him a chance, you might find he's not that different. 
 Really? I'm a cop, he's a cop groupie... trying to get involved in a murder he should have nothing to do with. 
 His brother was one of the victims. 
 Help! 
 Help! 
 Help! 
 Help! 
 Help! 
 Maybe no one's home. 
 Maybe. 
 May I help you? 
 Hello sir, we are from the ICC. 
 ICC? 
 We're police officers. 
 We're looking for Doctor, uh... Javier Almora. 
 Is he home? 
 My father? 
 No, not.. not... not right now. 
 When will he be back? 
 We have a few questions we'd want to ask him about his vet business. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, can we come in and wait for him? 
 I don't think so. 
 Why not? 
 My mother... she doesn't like people in her house. 
 But I could ask her. 
 Yes, please, that's a good idea. 
 Mama? Wait here. 
 Wait a minute. 
 What is it? 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Eva... 
 Eva? 
 Eva, can you hear me? Eva... 
 Eva... 
 Eva! 
 Eva! 
 Eva! 
 You, on the bed! On your feet, up! Up! 
 I got a body. I got a dead body! 
 Tommy! 
 Tommy! 
 Tommy, come here! 
 Eva! 
 Tommy! 
 Eva! 
 Eva! 
 I'm here! 
 Where is he? 
 It's clear. He's gone. 
 I found the father. 
 Alive? 
 Not for a long time. 
 sh1t. 
 Let's get the car. 
 Where's Mateo? 
 He must have taken him. 
 And he's got the key! 
 Don't you see I'm saving souls? 
 How dare you interfere? 
 There's no sign of them on the road. 
 I have my men searching the Ebro river. 
 We will find him, Eva. 
 After he's already been drowned... 
 Eva... 
 We told him to stay in the car. 
 So what, this is our fault now? 
 It's not our fault, but we shouldn't have left him behind. 
 Look, something in this house is gonna tell us where he is. 
 Here, take a look. 
 That's odd. 
 What? Aside from the fact we just rolled a guy out of here drugged to the eyeballs, destined to drown. 
 No, this. 
 That's not original. 
 It's some kind of home-improvement. 
 What? 
 Like a secret room? 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 You've definitely watched too many horror movies. 
 Can you smell that? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 Is she... 
 Dead? Yeah, I think, yeah. 
 This must be Mommy. 
 Hickman... 
 Yeah? 
 Look. 
 She's baptizing him. 
 They're not able to positively identify him as Javier Almora. 
 He's been deceased for close to a year. 
 That's when the drownings started. 
 Son's name is Pedro Almora. By not reporting him dead he's been able to keep his veterinarian credentials, and keep ordering the ketamine. 
 Wait, when he wouldn't let us in the house, he said something about his mother. 
 Yeah, well... 
 There's nobody there. 
 Just found the mother in the basement, and it ain't pretty. 
 I'm thinking her and dad died roughly at the same time. 
 So what? Parricide? 
 Maybe. And then we saw this. 
 We're thinking it's some kind of baptism. 
 It's starting to make sense. 
 Religious pilgrimage? Drowning? 
 So he's baptizing them? 
 Yeah, and he looks none too happy about his own in this photo, which makes me think it was a common occurrence. 
 Can I take a look? 
 Yeah. 
 The mother forced him to do it. 
 And now he's continuing her legacy. 
 I know this place. 
 I don't know who you are... but I'm sure you're a sinner. 
 My mother says... everyone is. 
 The only way to get rid of it... is by baptism, you know? 
 So be happy. 
 Beloved in the Lord, when the Saviour sent out his apostles, he said unto them, "Go ye, and teach all nations: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have planned for you. 
 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. 
 Do you accept the Lord as your saviour? 
 *** with *** permission, I baptize thee in the name of the Father! 
 Of the Son! 
 And of the Holy... Holy Ghost! 
 Stop! 
 Don't move! 
 Don't move! 
 Mateo! 
 Breathe! 
 You're all right, mate, you're all right. 
 Shouldn't you be resting? 
 I hate hospitals. 
 Anyway, I've got a hell of a story to write. 
 Well, you did right by Oscar. 
 Maybe. 
 Listen... near-death experiences make me hungry. 
 You want to grab something? 
 I'm buying. 
 The least I could do. 
 Not like... not like a date. 
 Unless you want it to be. 
 If not... 
 I do. 
 Ok. 
 Don't you have to tell them that you're leaving? 
 You kidding? 
 They might make me stay. 
 Oh, then I'm gonna take you to a very nice restaurant. 
 Oh yeah? 
 It's a place where my father used to take me when I was a child. 
 They make a very good "pinchitos" there. 
 Ok. 
 Surprise me. 
 I will.
