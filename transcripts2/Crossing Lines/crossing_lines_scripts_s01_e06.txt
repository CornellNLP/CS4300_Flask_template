 [Gunfire, grunts] 
 No! 
 Sebastian : We have a similar Florence case. 
 Eva : Rich victim, double-tap kills with 7.62s... 
 Sure looks like the same team did both. 
 This is the message... 
 "10 million Euros in cash, by 6:00 tonight." I thought it was five million? The price has doubled. Why? Because I am in charge. Mama? Oh, God! Maxim :  Please pay. These people have killed. They will hurt me. Scrambled voice : The ransom is 10 million Euros,  by 6:00 P.M. tonight. It's only 10 hours! I need more time. You don't have any more time. [Explosion roars] [Radio chatter] [Quiet conversation] Security : Bring it here. Move that car back, please. First, disconnect everything from the power. A surge could fry the CPUs. How could they have set a bomb here? Well, clearly, they've been planning this for quite some time. What about the family computer? Hard drive. I have everything, if I need to access it again. It was a small bomb in the security hub. Pretty much the only room damaged. Clever, though. Just took out the main power. Hickman : Where's Louis? Tommy : He's upstairs, gathering stuff before we evacuate. [♪] Maybe housekeeping has the day off. This laptop may help. Mm-hmm. I think we should get outside. What the hell kind of security did you hire? Excuse me? First, they let Maxim get kidnapped, then somebody plants a bomb in their office. So this is all their fault? Fault? I don't think they are smart enough for blame. You okay? How was I ever married to that? There was an explosion? Tommy : A small, controlled blast in the security hub. A guard was injured. And... the kidnappers? They called, but... We're waiting for a new contact, and it appears that they caused the explosion. Marianski's right about one thing. That bomb means the kidnappers were inside your house. [♪] They're all out of the house. Good. I've never seen those police before, though. It doesn't matter. Haven't we always been told  to abandon if anything unknown happens? Just make the second phone call. But... - Now! [♪] [Phone buzzes, vibrating] I have a call. The number says blocked. Don't let it ring too long. Yes? What? She wants it on speaker. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Okay. Do we have all your attention now? You already had our attention. The bomb was unnecessary. Katya, scrambled :  What we heard was Mr. Marianski refusing to meet the demand. We answered his refusal. You now have until 2:00 P.M. We will contact you in two hours exactly, via Skype... Or you will never see Maxim again. [♪] Will you be able to get a computer running in two hours? I can set one up in 45 seconds, madame. Time's not a factor. When you're set up, go though this. It's Maxim's. Captain Geroux? May we use your station in town? Of course. We should go, right now. Why? That phone call, she waited until I was in the group, until I could hear, even said "okay" just as I got here, and then she asked if she had all of our attention. Meaning? Meaning that I think she's watching us. [♪] It is Katya. In Florence. I think you need to let our superiors know. I brought a deal to Yan, and he said he got authorization to carry it out, But now, I'm not sure he actually told anyone. [♪] Crossing Lines 01x06 
Special Ops, Part 2 
Origianl Air Date July 21, 2013 We've prepared a place for you to work. Mr. Marianski. Now would be a good time to start gathering the money. I'm already working on it. [♪] Hickman : One hour until contact. We'll be ready. [♪] Did we have to kill the girl? You have regrets? She wasn't a threat. You know we had to kill her. And you know why. Now is the wrong time to get weak, Masha. We are close to done. Huh? Do I need to worry about you? ♪ ♪ Because I need it liquidated, Francois. Stop questioning me. No, don't call me back. Do it! French bankers. They act like they own my money. Will you be able to get it? It won't be easy. Madame Pelletier? Is there any news? No. Not yet. I need you to list all workmen who have been in your home in the last few months. Workmen? Yeah. Construction workers, utility workers, anyone with tools. Someone planted that explosive, and evidence techs just uncovered this. Your camera system was definitely compromised. For how long? There's no way of knowing. Cameras inside, too? It appears so. Why? Are you worried, Mr. Marianski? Were you doing something inside you shouldn't have been? I don't even live there. Doesn't mean you have nothing to hide. What did you say? Things like this are generally done by people dressed as workmen. That list will be very helpful. Thank you. Louis? [♪] Yeah. Louis, what's going on? What do you mean? What was that about? Look after yourself, Carl. Major Daniel? Yeah? Laptop's not Maxim's. It belongs to the girlfriend, Laure, which might actually be more helpful, because if she was involved, there might be evidence on it. Ah. Let me know. [♪] [Laughing] Detective Vicente. Look who's home. Florence was never my home. Well, Italy was, until you accepted a detail to the Netherlands. You sound jealous. Why? Are the men handsome there? How did you know I'd be here? Your friend at the I.C.C. Was snooping through our computers... again. He doesn't snoop. He just gets information we need to do our job. I am notified when he does that now. Thank you for that. I never should've told you. Why are you so interested in such an old case? Because we have a similar one in Cannes. Our case is closed. It's a total resolution. No, it's not! I have a hundred questions. Where was he held? How was the turn-over handled? Was ransom paid? How much? And how were the demands delivered? Make an official request. Listen. I'll do this for you. You go back to your team. I'll get the information to you through the proper channels. I have a victim being held by kidnappers now, so I don't really have time for "proper channels," okay? Where are you going now? The only witness worked at the school, so I'm gonna start with her. And then you gonna have dinner with me? You never change! I got a special place that's gonna blow your mind! [Blows a kiss] [Knocking] Senora? [Speaks in italian] [♪] Katya. Please. So, what do you remember about the Allesandro Cosanza kidnapping? Allesandro? Mm-hmm. Ohuh... I thought that case was closed? I'm not from the same unit as the first investigators. And you're listed as the only witness. Why was there no one else? Uh, what unit do you work for? Please answer my question. The school was closed. I was here early that morning, for a meeting. With whom? [Chuckles sadly] With Allesandro, actually. But, um, unfortunately, he never made it into the building. But why were you meeting with him? I wanted to show him some options for moving on after graduation. But he was only in his second year. So you needed to schedule a meeting during off-hours to discuss something that wouldn't happen for the next two years, is that correct? You know, um... It was a very traumatic event in my life that I'd rather forget. Lieutenant Vicente handled it. You should contact him. I'm only trying to understand what happened, to apply it to a current kidnapping we have going on. Another kidnapping? Yeah. [Phone ringing] God, that's horrible. [Sighs] But, as you see, I'm very busy, and I really don't know more than what is in that report. The officers were very thorough. Okay, then. Well, thanks for your help... "Katya"? Yes. Mr. Marianski. Is it bad news? Do you know more than you've said? What? [♪] Could this be because of a business dealing with your old colleagues? I've been a legitimate businessman for more than a decade. But you weren't before. Far from it. Look, you can ask me anything, investigate anything. Names, dates... I don't care. Maxim is the only good thing I ever did. I would die for him. Excuse me. [♪] Hey. Guard's gonna make it. Marianski called them stupid for letting it happen. I don't know about stupid, but a bomb planted in the security hub does scream operational flaw. You know what else it screams? Inside job... And we're running out of people on the inside. [♪] I have a delivery for Mr. Marianski. [♪] 10 million. Thank you. You got it all? Of course I did. ♪ ♪ [Skype alert pings] You are late! I still have two more minutes. You were supposed to sign in at 10:55! Know where I was? Talking to a cop about the last kidnapping. She was connecting dots to this one. Did you tell her anything? Of course not! Then forget about her. This will be over in a few hours and we'll all be rich. Patch me through. [Katya sighs] [Skype alert pings] [♪] Katya's voice, scrambled :  Pay attention. I want to see my son! Pay attention and watch carefully. Maxim's life will depend on it. I want to show you something. These... Are two standard air tanks. Each one has got 187 minutes of air. Remember that number. It will be very important to your son's future... Or lack of. This tube... Connects one of the tanks to a thing we call... "The box." You can't breathe inside  unless one of the air tanks is providing the air. Here is a little camera... And here is how it works. Maxim goes into the box. We switch one of the tanks on. That gives him 187 minutes of air. The ransom drop will be in 180 minutes... Exactly 2 :00 P.M. At the Cannes Marina. That gives our courier 7 minutes to get away, make the phone call to say he's okay. Then... We'll switch over the air tanks  and tell you where to come and get him. Oh... And it doesn't matter who does the drop-off... The cops, the lawyers... You can send an army, Well, I think you'll get it. [Sobbing breath] Showtime. Maxim : No! No! Please don't hurt me! Down! [Maxim grunts] No! Don't hurt him! [Maxim pants, grunts] [Maxim gasps and pants] [Mrs. Marianski sobbing] ["The Box" closing] [Lock clacks] There. Maxim, muffled : Help me! 187 minutes until switch-over... Or suffocation. Your choice. [Sobbing] One more thing. Maxim, muffled : Help me! Remember the little camera? Maxim : Help! Just in case things do go bad... You can be with him all the way until the end. Maxim :  Help me! Oh, no! Don't hurt him! [Mrs. Marianski sobbing] [Pounding lid, grunting] Help me! It's me again... Katya. You wanted to know when they made contact with the parents? They just set up a drop. They put the guy in the box. You didn't know, did you? [Sighs] Now, police came here today... a woman. Asking questions about the last one. I said nothing. You have to believe I didn't know this was freelance. Yan told me it was all approved! I didn't know! 
 
 [Click] Hello? Hello! ♪ ♪ [Maxim exhales] Oh, my God. [Pants for air] We have a feed. Something's coming through. Mr. Marianski. Hello? Eva? Where are you? How did you get on this Skype? [Voices in hall, chatting] I'm in the flat of a woman named Katya. She was the only witness in the Florence kidnapping,  and she worked at the art school  the victim attended. Art school? You know it? Didn't Maxim go to an art school in Italy for a while? Yes, the Centro di... Centro di Restauro. I just left there. It's a block from here. The connection between the victims. Katya. She's a guidance counsellor. She handled Maxim's enrollment. Asked me a hundred questions about him, and about you. There are three screens here. One of them has Maxim in some kind of a small box, and another one is showing a fireplace and a brick wall... An empty room? Before we switched over to the box cam, there was a man on camera. They left the connection open? With Katya. That image is coming from where they're holding him. Can we use this to find them? Maybe... Eva? I'm going to tell you how to locate the I.P. address of those laptops. If they're acting as the communications server for the operation, then all the other computers should be routed through them. Then we have a chance. Right. I'm ready. Okay. The other laptop with Maxim's feed, is it a Mac or a pc? What? - The symbol on the laptop. Is it a Mac or a pc? What symbol? [Gasps] Eva! Turn around! No! Get up. [♪] [Chair clatters] [Women grunting] Get the gun! Get the gun! [Women grunting] [Blows landing] [Katya crying out] [Eva screams] [Thud] She's gone. Eva... [Katya gasps] [Both panting] Where's Maxim? [She pants] Where's the box? It doesn't matter. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? I knew it wasn't authorized. I knew and they'll know. [Wheezing] We're all dead anyway. It... Doesn't matter! [Eva yelps as muffled shot fires] [Gasps] [Stunned gasping] [Cell ringing, Eva wheezing] [/i] Hello?[/i] Eva! Are you all right? Yeah, I'm... I'm all right. But the lady, Katya... [Panting] She's not... [Eva continues wheezing] She's dead. I still might be able to use the laptops to locate them. I will call you. Major. You need to get going. Why? What... The ransom. Yeah. [Wheezing] Laure... You said you'd take me dancing before the party. Don't forget the party after. Why... You deserve tonight, baby. Why did you do this? He thinks his girlfriend did this. So what? His heart breaks like everyone else's. Did you really just say that? Shut up. [Snickering] [Chuckles] Where did that come from? Sometimes, I hate you. "His heart breaks like everyone else's!" [Door slams] [♪] Be careful out there, major. Okay. I wish I could show you how much I appreciate what you are all doing. A bonus at Christmas time wouldn't be turned down. I'll remember that. [♪] What? I'm not a cop anymore. Uh, no. No, no. I just, um... I need to show you something. [♪] [Cell rings] Dorn. Louis. I don't know, Dorn. You don't know? I can't tell if it's connected or not. He says it's not. You asked him? Not directly. Listen, I am in the middle of something now. I don't think you should go to Russia until we can be certain  Dimitrov doesn't know. Right. Good idea. Thank you, Louis. [♪] [Speaking Russian] [♪] [Sighs] [♪] I think you're right. What should we do about it? Nothin'... Yet. Maxim :  Is someone watching this? Anyone? Someone? It's not like you could answer, right? But I need to say something to my parents. You were right about Laure, mom. It's all because of her. I was stupid to believe anyone could like me for me. But I've been thinking about me  and you and dad. [Breathes heavily] Why were we always so angry? [Shivers wearily] You mad at dad... Dad mad at me, me mad at everybody. The whole house was angry all the time. I hated it. And, right now, honestly... I can't remember why it was like that. It's no use to be mad. All I want to do is go home and be together. Be strong, son. Help is coming. Tell my parents I'm sorry...  [He takes sobbing breath] [Wheezes] ...And I'm going to miss them. [♪] I have it, the empty room. [♪] Where do I find Maxim? [Latch clacks] Tommy, the target is on the move. I have it, major. North. Louis :  Stay as far back as you can until he makes the call. We need them to change that tank over. Captain Geroux and his men will track it from the ground. Don't lose that money. You got it, boss. Louis :  Maxim has only five minutes of air left. [♪] [Breathing softly] Hushed : Look! The room! You don't need to whisper. It's a one-way connection. They don't know we can see them. Yan :  Yes, yes, yes, yes! Masha! "Masha"? He named her. Yeah. Yeah. Yan : He's got the money. He's got the money! [Laughing] Go and change the air tanks. I'll tell them that they can pick him up. Can you isolate those faces? Running them through facial recognition software now. [Air hissing] [Maxim pounding on lid] Yan :  Come on, come on. I think they've changed the tanks over. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up! Katya's not going to answer. Come on! Tell us where you are! Pick up! Where the hell are you? Okay, the male is named... Yan! - Pick up! What the... [♪] [Shots firing] [Gasping] Oh, my God! [Shell casings clatter] No! You have to find him! He has only three hours! They're following the money! Mrs. Marianski : You have to! Oh, God! They don't know! They don't know where he is! Let them work! It's okay. It's okay. Let them work. We still have a good track, right? Still going straight north. Anne-Marie, calculate the exact amount of time we have left! The exact amount! [Tommy]: Guys? - Go, Tommy! The tracker... ...it's stopped moving. Call them in, Tommy. Take him down. [Tires squealing] Against the wall! Shouts : Where is he? The guy in the box? What do you want? I just delivered! I was told to put them in that can! Who paid you? I work for the courier company! Get him out of here! Yeah, all right. He didn't know anything. He's just a delivery man. [Frustrated sigh] Anne-marie : Time's running out. What are we gonna do? Now's the time. Hickman : May I have a moment, please? Alone? I don't understand. What's going on? It's all right, monsieur. [♪] Anne-Marie? Mm-hmm? Would you say that's a window? What? Look at the glass, on the table. Is that a window reflected in it? Maybe... Let me enhance this. I'll get an image of the landscape outside. And we should look through all the footage we've been sent. You know, the ransom, it's almost exactly what Lev has left. They couldn't have known that... But his financials were on your computer. Does he know that? I mean, you had to figure we would find that out. [Words catch] Uh... That must've been left there when we... when he moved... And the cameras, the bomb... H... How could they have gotten into and out of your home without being seen? And when I said that the cameras inside... were probably compromised, Caroline, you didn't even blink. I'd think the notion of those kidnappers watching you walk around your house would have bothered you just a little. I must not have... Was that to put pressure on Lev? You knew the insurance was cancelled. You knew he'd balk at the amount? Did you need a final convincer? A bomb? No. I would never, I... Caroline, on Laure's Facebook account, she sent a message to her sister about Maxim's surprise party, about how she was supposed to take him to the club, and then to the party, but nobody was supposed to know... And that she was excited that you... trusted her enough to help you surprise him, that you, Caroline... Gave her the address to that non-existent party. [♪] I don't know where they are holding him. That was their one condition... That I wouldn't know until they had the money. Tell me everything you know. Everything. The other one went so well. Maxim was a new student at the art school when the other boy was kidnapped. I overheard it... the woman, Katya, was on the phone with the kidnappers. She didn't know I was there. At first, I was going to turn her in, but... I thought, "let's see how this goes." "See how it turns out." I guess I was already thinking about Lev, and hurting him. I hate him so much. [Sobbing breath] When the other boy, Allesandro, was returned safely, completely unharmed, I went to see Katya and told her that I would turn them in, unless we could work together, and that my ex-husband was very rich and... What about the girl? Why was she killed? I don't know. Do you have any idea where they're holding him? [Sob escapes] [Cell rings] [Grunts] Louis? It was not Dimitrov. Are you sure? Yeah. It was the mother. She set it up to hurt Marianski over personal issues. Thank you, Louis. [Speaks russian] [♪] [Speaks russian] We have an image of the landscape outside the house. I enhanced the reflection of a window in the glass on the table. I have a geo-profiling program that I can feed it into, see what matches that area. Look! [Dispatch radios crackling] What? There. Doesn't that look like a radio telescope, on the hill? Oh, it sure does. We can triangulate with the landscape from the window reflected in the glass. Come on! Yes! Is that live? No, it's a satellite image. Tommy. We believe Maxim could be in a very isolated area. You need to find it fast. Shoot. I'm going to send you some nav coordinates to your PDA. We think this is where Maxim is. It's an isolated farmhouse, surrounded by whitish stone outcroppings. Anne-marie :  There's a radio com tower a half kilometer north of the farmhouse. Tommy : All right. Louis :  Tommy, we don't have a lot of time. [Maxim wheezing on video] [♪] Hickman :  It's in a small valley, Tommy. The farmhouse should be in the center. Nothing! Sebastian :  You're looking for a radio tower and a farmhouse nearby. I don't see it! [♪] Tommy :  I'm just seeing fields, mate. Louis :  Tommy, the air is running out. [Weak wheezing on video] Tommy :  No, wait, wait! This might be something! Tommy : This must be it! Send me down there now! ♪ ♪ All right. I have him. Yeah, he's breathing. He's good. [♪] He's got him. ♪ ♪ Lev : What will happen to her? Can she afford a good lawyer? The best. Good. What she did is inexcusable... But I'm not blameless in it. [Louis pats Lev's arm] So I guess the Christmas gift won't be necessary? [Laughs] I was just joking about that. Still... I'm fine with it. What do you mean? $30,000 seems more than fair to get my son back. [♪] I need to... There's a lot to explain to him. Quietly : Yeah. [♪] Papa... [Door creaks open, then shuts] [♪] I'm sorry. It's all right. I don't want to forget. Rebecca... I know. [♪] [Knocking] I saw the light. Come in. Come in, please. Sit. You wanted to know if Genovese had left again? I did. A bunch of them left. Genovese, the manager, the boss. They all left in a hurry. For good? They said they'd be back in a few days, but something seemed to be bothering them. Thank you. You're welcome. Shari? Don't go. [Breathing heavily] [♪] Yes. It's SB335. [Chuckles dryly] Yes, I had a very bad night, but it's okay, I have the money. All 30,000 of it. [♪] [Sighing heavily]
