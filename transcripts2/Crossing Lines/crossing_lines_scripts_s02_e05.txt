 Why not? 
 Because you are not staying out all night with some older boy. 
 Julian is not some older boy. He lives down the street. 
 That doesn't change his age. 
 Mom? 
 Please! 
 Why doesn't Julian just come here for dinner, and then you two can watch a movie? 
 So Dad can sit between us? 
 Just next to you. 
 See? 
 This is so unfair! 
 Oh, my God. Frank! 
 What happened? 
 I had an accident. 
 Come in, please. 
 Dankeschön. Thank you. 
 Who are you? 
 Wait! What are you doing? 
 Mr. Deprez? 
 Anne? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that's right, that one. 
 Eric, I have to go now. 
 I'll call you tomorrow, okay? 
 Okay, Daddy. 
 Chief Inspector Galland? 
 I'm Investigator Hickman from the ICC? 
 Right, yes. 
 These are my colleagues, Berger, Vittoria. 
 Hi. 
 We spoke last night, sir. 
 Thank you for coming so soon. 
 German police is working on a series of six takeover home invasions that started a little over than a month ago. 
 Like this? 
 Not quite. 
 No one was murdered. 
 The perps overpowered and blindfolded the families, and then just took money and property. 
 But the violence has been escalating somewhat with every incident. 
 If these are the same people, the violence escalated a lot more than somewhat. 
 You mean... 
 Is the entire family dead? 
 Yes. 
 The father was briefly conscious when the uniforms arrived. 
 He only said one word, "German" 
 German? 
 I assumed he meant the perpetrators, but I can't be sure. 
 The call was anonymous. 
 You couldn't trace it? 
 Right. 
 Shall we? 
 No, thanks. 
 I've seen enough. 
 I'll be here if you have any questions. 
 Looks like they were more interested in damage than theft. 
 I've sent all the German files over to the office. 
 We'll get a full inventory of missing items, but I remember electronics and jewelry stolen. 
 Easily fenced. 
 Oh, God... 
 Never gets easier when it's children. 
 No. 
 You should get your scanner over here, Sebastian. 
 Doesn't look like there are any ridge impressions. 
 Probably gloves. 
 They wore boots. 
 See here? 
 Have a look. 
 Wait a minute. 
 I recognize the logo. 
 It's German motorcycle gear. 
 I think there were two boot prints just like this found in the mud at the scene in Germany. 
 I've got the pictures somewhere. 
 Here we go. 
 I have the boot prints from both scenes on my screen. 
 They look pretty identical to me. 
 The same kind of boot is circumstantial. 
 Close to the same size, too. 
 "Close to." 
 This murder scene is less than 50 miles away from the last home invasion in Germany. 
 That's a relatively small area to have two different patterns running. 
 But not impossible. 
 Is it enough to take to Dorn? 
 It's enough to try. 
 Look, tell Dorn if these are the same guys, then... then this could get worse, because they've got a taste for it now. 
 Famke, it's lovely. 
 I heard you say orchids are your favorite. 
 Well, it looks kind of lonely there. 
 "If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly... our whole life would change." 
 The Buddha. 
 Indeed. 
 Louis has a potential case for us. 
 Potential? 
 Well, because the cross-border elements are not yet certain. 
 Six German cases, one in Belgium, but I need a list of all the similarities to see if there is a pattern that I can present to the Court. 
 We don't a lot of time. 
 If this is the same group, they've already murdered an entire family in Veviers. 
 Sebastian is bringing his equipment in. We need to identify who called this in. 
 Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. 
 And then we'll know why they wanted to stay anonymous. 
 These the family phones? 
 Father and mother. We're having the sim cards processed. 
 Did you find the girl's phone? 
 Teenage girl must have a cell phone. 
 We didn't find one. 
 Where's her room? 
 Second door upstairs. 
 I'll go upstairs. 
 Her texts stop at 21:52. 
 Sebastian, what time did the emergency call go out? 
 22:05. 
 13 minutes later. 
 There's something else. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Eva, and this is Hickman. 
 Do you know the people up the street? 
 The people? 
 Tell me you don't know which people I mean? 
 The family with a dozen police cars out front. 
 Your name is Julian, right? 
 Yes. 
 Know how I know that? 
 You stopped texting her ten minutes before the police were contacted. 
 Do you mind if I have a word with him? 
 No. 
 He's having a bad day. 
 Do you know what happened to Anne and her family? 
 Did you go over there last night? 
 Yes? 
 Did you find them? 
 Anne wasn't answering my texts. 
 I should've known something bad was happening. 
 How would you know? 
 There was a white SUV parked outside. 
 It had a German tag. 
 I saw it earlier, but didn't think. 
 Then it sped out of here past my house. 
 Just one vehicle? 
 Because there are two sets of tire tracks. 
 The other set is probably from Mr. Deprez's new car. 
 They must have stolen it. 
 Did you see how many? 
 I only saw the woman. 
 A woman? 
 Blonde. 
 She got out of the SUV and went to the door. 
 They used a woman as a decoy. 
 She went to the door first. 
 The family let her in. 
 The doorbell. 
 The Court did not grant its approval. 
 They did not? 
 No, it was sympathetic with the nature of your evidence, but... it was their opinion that the cross-border implications were circumstantial, and they need a concrete connection. 
 The Court is the Court, Louis. 
 Yes. 
 I will persevere. 
 Thank you. 
 The woman should be the last person to touch the doorbell. 
 The kid said the door was already open when he got here. 
 There is a fresh print. 
 What is it? 
 A hit. 
 Her name is Silke Beck from Essen, Germany. 
 Probably why the father said German. 
 She has a record. 
 Arrests made in Denmark and France for drugs, prostitution, and petty theft. 
 No violence, though? 
 She's the decoy. 
 Acts like she needs help, maybe plays hurt. 
 Gets the family to open the door. 
 Exactly. 
 Explains why none of the home invasions had forced entry. 
 What does that say there under identifying marks? 
 Tattoos? 
 A thorny rose wrapped around her right arm. 
 Black angel wings on her shoulder blades. 
 On her lower back, a skull wearing a knight's helmet with the words "Property of Max." 
 I'd like to have a word with Max. 
 Is just her being German enough to make it cross border? 
 No. 
 I've talked to the State Police in Germany. 
 There was a print on the doorbell, but there was no match in their system. 
 I've sent them a print of our scan for comparison. 
 Good. 
 That skull logo, I've seen that somewhere before. 
 Do you have a tattoo recognition? 
 Yeah, that. 
 It's the logo of the Kavalier Motorcycle Club. 
 I've dealt with them before. 
 They're one of the most infamous biker gangs in Europe. 
 Some German cities asked the government to ban their activity altogether. They're a disaster. 
 Biker boots, biker tattoos, biker chick. 
 If it walks like a duck... 
 Then it's a biker gang. 
 If it walks like a duck it's a biker gang? 
 Berger speaking. 
 Are you sure? 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Silke Beck's print is a match to the print found at the scene in Germany. 
 That's the... connection. 
 Good work. Come home. 
 We have bikers to catch. 
 The Kavalier Motorcycle Club has been around since the '70s, but its heyday began with the EU's relaxing of borders. 
 Their territory has expanded across Europe and beyond. 
 The number of chapters has doubled in the last decade. 
 They mainly deal in arms, drugs, and extortion. 
 Now we can add home invasion and homicide to their accomplishments. 
 Yeah, but why these homes? 
 I mean, how are they picking these victims? 
 Could they be elaborate hits? 
 I mean, they have been known to engage in contract killing. 
 Are any of these victims likely to be targets of value? 
 We haven't received the files yet, but there doesn't seem to be anything unusual about these victims. 
 Up and down the income scale. 
 I mean, scattered all over the place. 
 These crimes appear to be premeditated, but if there's a pattern, I don't get it. 
 Eva, anything about the white SUV your witness saw? 
 Not yet, sir. 
 I'm checking footage from traffic cameras at intersections nearby. 
 In Germany as well. 
 I doubt they'd use the same SUV for all the crimes. 
 If it hasn't been dumped by now, it will be soon. 
 I'm out! 
 Silke... 
 No. No, I'm out. 
 Okay, let's talk. 
 Talk? 
 There's nothing to talk about. 
 What they did in there, that was just... 
 It was... 
 It got out of hand, and Wulf is sorry about it, aren't you, Wulf? 
 Sorry for wh... 
 Yeah. Sorry. 
 He's not sorry. 
 He's an animal. 
 Watch your mouth, bitch. 
 Bitch? 
 Are you going to let him talk to your woman that way? 
 Are you my woman? 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Well, "I'm out," doesn't sound like it. 
 We were only supposed to take stuff. 
 What they did in there, that was just... 
 It just... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I... I just can't do that again. 
 Shh... Come here. 
 Come here. 
 Drive the SUV out and dump it and ride back here with Toad. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 I just can't do that again. Please, never again. 
 You don't have to. 
 Never again. 
 There was just a vehicle fire off the E40 in Walheim, Germany. 
 White SUV, stripped of plates and serial numbers. 
 A woman's body was recovered from the inside. 
 Silke Beck. 
 They killed her? 
 Looks like they're cleaning up behind them. 
 They know they've gone too far this time. 
 Which makes them more dangerous. 
 Even if it is Silke... and we need to confirm that... we cannot wait around on this, Louis. 
 But we need a real witness. 
 These are the hard copies of all the German files. 
 What do you mean a real witness? 
 Silke Beck was the only evidentiary connection. 
 Everything else is circumstantial. 
 It's enough to get authorization to investigate, but not a conviction. 
 We need to get on the inside. 
 An undercover operation? That could take weeks, months. 
 We have days. 
 Well, I can do that. I'm ready for it. 
 No. Not this case, Eva. 
 Well, I'm the most qualified person here. 
 They just lost their female decoy. 
 If they're going to do another job, they're going to need a woman. 
 We just saw how they treat women. 
 Carl's right. Even if you survived the initiation, they will tell you nothing. 
 I'll leave you to it. 
 Yeah. 
 What we need is a German male who knows how to ride a bike. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Yeah. 
 Riding a bike's on my resume. 
 I know. 
 No, this is insane. 
 I'm sorry, but Sebastian has zero experience in undercover. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. 
 We don't need him in that deep, only on the periphery. 
 You blend in, keep your eyes and ears open, inform us of their plans. A couple of days, you're out. 
 Yeah, I... can do that. 
 Major, this is crazy. 
 Eva, Sebastian will need a crash course in undercover technique. 
 Understood? 
 Yes, sir, understood. 
 Arabela and Carl, help Dorn build an alias for him. 
 Your first undercover. 
 What kind of bike do you ride? 
 A dirt bike. Once or... 
 Once. 
 Come on. Who tells the whole truth on a resume? 
 Start by thinking like they think. 
 They just committed a major crime, so they're hot right now. 
 They'll be extra-alert. 
 You need to make them look at you not as a threat. 
 How? 
 By not being interested in things a cop would be. 
 And not trying too hard. Trying looks suspicious. 
 I think we need to fabricate a gang-oriented criminal career that never quite intersects with Kavalier, but comes very close. 
 No, we have excellent people who can do the documentation for you, and they're very quick. 
 I have a good in for Sebastian. Peter Forst. 
 I arrested him a few times, and he's worked for me as a C.I. 
 His brother was a full patch Kavalier outlaw who took the fall for a murder he did not commit by order of the gang. 
 He died in Scheveningen Prison, and his brother wants payback. 
 He'll make the introduction. 
 Your persona will have to be as much like your real self as possible. 
 The more you change, the more you have to keep track of. 
 For example, your name. 
 Keep your first name, so you won't forget how to answer to it. 
 Sebastian's not a good biker name. 
 Yeah, I know. How about... Bash? 
 Bash? 
 My nickname from middle school. I know, I know. 
 Okay, it's cool. 
 It's okay. 
 Bash. 
 Yeah. 
 We will say Peter and Sebastian were cell mates. 
 Sebastian's story better be airtight, right back to kindergarten. 
 These are very dangerous people. 
 Let me test you whether you're a cop or not. 
 Snort this line of coke. 
 On parole. Gotta piss in a cup tomorrow. 
 Screw me on the pool table in front of everyone. 
 Show me what you got. 
 What I got is the clap. 
 If you want to take a chance, let's go. 
 Where did you do your time? 
 Scheveningen. 
 I know that place. Which cell block were you in? 
 How long were you in for? What color are the walls in the dining hall... 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down! 
 No, you don't think! You either know it, or you're lying. 
 Yes, come. 
 Fast work. 
 Hold on, hold on. This is wrong. 
 Arabela, the driver's license was issued three years ago. He was... 
 Bash, he would have been in prison at that time. 
 Have them make it four years ago, and make it look like it's four years old! 
 You have a wire in your jacket. 
 GPS on your phone 24-7. 
 We'll have your back. 
 If it gets bad, just... give us the signal and we'll be inside within 60 seconds, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Ciao. 
 Ciao. 
 Right. 
 
 
 
 Wow. 
 You look great. 
 Not too great. 
 Perfect. 
 Sebastian... 
 Be careful. 
 We're in position. 
 Bash? 
 What's up, Peter. 
 It's been a while. 
 You ready to do this? 
 Yeah. Are you? 
 Private party. 
 It's cool, Kurt. He's with me. 
 Max knows he's coming. 
 Hi, Kaspar. 
 Two Pils. 
 Take it easy, man. 
 You don't know these guys. 
 I've seen what they do. 
 Back door's padlocked. 
 If something happens, we have to go in through the front, but there are security cameras everywhere. 
 I wasn't expecting that in this dump. 
 Well, they have a lot to worry about. 
 Oh, and another for my friend Wulf. 
 Hey, Wulf, this is Bash. 
 We were cell mates in Holland, together. 
 If the club is looking for anyone in the field of computer hacking, alarms, he's your man. 
 He's the best. 
 Is that right? 
 Oh, yeah, definitely. 
 We used to talk all the time about it in Scheveningen. 
 And I was telling Bash he should really meet you guys about working... 
 Why don't you shut your gob, you stupid little bitch? 
 If I want to ask for a job, I'll ask myself. 
 If you are as good as Peter says you are, why don't we have you demonstrate? 
 In the back. 
 Now. 
 That ain't part of the script. 
 Let him go with it. 
 Just him. Little bitch. 
 Yeah. 
 We are not... 
 Who the hell is this? 
 This is Bash, a friend of Peter Forst. 
 Claims he's good with alarms. 
 I think we're all full up on tech support, aren't we, Lenz? 
 I didn't claim anything. I didn't come here for a job. 
 I came for a beer. Peter's got a big mouth. 
 You hack security systems? 
 Not on parole, I don't. 
 Good to meet you. 
 Wait. 
 This is a remote-code cam lock safe. 
 Can you open that in three minutes? 
 Two. 
 Okay, you've got two minutes. 
 That's a gun! I'm going in. 
 Wait! 
 Wait. Give it a minute! Wait. 
 Time it. 
 Good luck. 
 And... go. 
 It's 15 seconds to the door. 
 Okay, we have 45 seconds at least to make a move if he messes up. 
 I hope that's enough time. 
 It is enough. It is. Calm down. 
 What was your name again? 
 Bash Kortig. 
 Where you from? 
 Berlin. 
 What part? 
 Hermannplatz. 
 Excuse me? 
 Hermannplatz. 
 Where did you do your time? 
 Which stretch? 
 20 seconds. 
 The house you met Peter in? 
 Scheveningen. 
 Scheveningen? 
 Whoa. 10 seconds to spare. 
 Can I have my damned beer now? 
 Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. 
 That was close. 
 I heard you like to work old school. 
 Old dogs, I guess. 
 It's too perfectly random. 
 The pattern is no pattern. 
 There has to be some way that they're choosing these victims. 
 Maybe they're just looking for families? 
 Home invasion number two, a single man. 
 And small-time burglaries? 
 These guys are arms smugglers and drug runners. 
 They usually only kill other gangs. 
 So why, all of a sudden, they're attacking civilians in their homes, for what? 
 To steal televisions and necklaces? 
 It is too much of a change. 
 Like I said, it's hard to teach an old dog a new tricks. 
 You trust him? I don't trust him. 
 I can smell a cop a mile away, but we use him on this final job tomorrow, then he can follow Silke into the grave. 
 Who the hell is it? 
 Max has a message for Bash. 
 Details on a job tonight in Lembeck. 
 I have the make and model of alarm system for you. 
 Securicorp DX12. 
 No problem. 
 Sebastian. 
 Major, I have a location. 
 Lembeck is 42 kilometers above Essen. 
 Population 5,300. 
 We can rendezvous with the SWAT team there. 
 The DX12 is a custom alarm. 
 There can't be too many in a town of that size. 
 If we can narrow it down, this could be the break we need. 
 Sebastian, listen to me. 
 Hang in there and don't worry. We will be watching your back. 
 Yes, sir. 
 They're still there. 
 I guess we need to find a way to shake them off tonight. 
 Create a little diversion. 
 Got it. Thank you for your help. 
 What's up? 
 SecuriCorp have three locations in Lembeck with that model of alarm. 
 One is a fitness club, one is unoccupied, and the other is... a private residence. 
 Tommy, we've got the coordinates of the probable target coming your way. 
 Go, let's go, let's go. It's all right. 
 Fast as you can, fast as you can. 
 Okay, let's get everybody out of here. 
 What is your problem now? 
 I don't get it. 
 If you know he's a cop, why take a chance? 
 What chance? 
 We need someone who can get us through that alarm system, and Wulf kills him. 
 But you know he's being tailed. 
 We are taking care of that. 
 What if it doesn't work? 
 Then I guess Wulf is going to be caught tonight. 
 Silke was right, he's out of control. 
 We can take care of everything at once. 
 They're on the move. 
 None of the other victims had alarm systems. 
 So why a family with one tonight? 
 Cars. 
 Cars. 
 Do you still have those photos, the... the ones of the tire tracks? 
 Here. Two sets of tracks. 
 One for the SUV, the other for the family car. 
 Across the street, the neighbors had a brand new BMW, but... they steal this family's car. 
 Why would you steal a car worth 15,000 Euros when there's one worth 50 just across the street? 
 They stole a car at every location. 
 Stolen. 
 Stolen. 
 And they're all the same make. 
 Every family had the same make, all brand new cars. 
 No wonder they didn't steal the Beemer across the street. 
 But why this make? 
 Let's run some serial numbers and find out. 
 What's happening, Eva? 
 I can't hear their voices. 
 You'll get it back when we are done. 
 That's it. 
 Give the jacket to Klaus. 
 Major, I've lost his mobile signal. 
 Do you have eyes on him? 
 Yeah, but they all look the same from here. 
 Do you still have a fix on the wire in his jacket? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I have five of them in the van. 
 Three of them just took off on bikes heading east on the 58, another three back towards Essen, along with the jacket. 
 Why did we have to change? 
 We never wear leathers on the job. 
 Yeah, I get it, but why did we split up? 
 You ask a lot of questions. 
 Hey! 
 On the 14th of last month, a car carrier from the factory in Bratislava was rolled out, headed for Amsterdam, but was hijacked just south of Cologne. 
 About an hour away from Essen. 
 Three weeks before Kavalier began its reign of terror. 
 According to company records, a second car carrier was dispatched on the same day, headed for Cologne. 
 All seven vehicles stolen from the victims were on that carrier. 
 They hijacked the wrong car carrier. 
 Wait. 
 Doesn't this gang deal in heroin that comes out of Bratislava? 
 Yes. 
 Well, you can hide a lot of dope in the doors of a cheap cars. 
 Sebastian's mobile signal is back. 
 34 Laurenstrasse. 
 Oh, no. 
 What is it? 
 That's Peter's flat. 
 Sebastian's cover is blown. 
 Almost there. 
 Lembeck already? 
 Not Lembeck. 
 The real job. 
 I think we can find where he's really going. 
 The last car was registered to Gerta Kaufman. 
 In Lembeck. 
 No, Alpen, 50 kilometers west. 
 Are you sure? 
 Definitely. 
 Tommy, Eva, listen. 
 The target is Alpen, 19 Birtenstrasse. 
 I can be there in 20. 
 This is just an input device. I need to disarm the main box. 
 Okay, then where is it? 
 Usually with the other utilities. 
 Let's go. 
 Here we go. 
 That one? 
 They'd be better off with a dog. 
 I would just cut its throat. 
 Come on, kill the alarm and open the gate. 
 30 seconds. 
 This isn't an Olympic event. 
 20. 
 It's not as easy as just cutting the red wire. 
 Bingo. 
 What is this? 
 You resist, you get hurt. 
 You take whatever you want. 
 I know! 
 Come on. Let's get what we came for. 
 The alarm has an automatic alert if it isn't reset in time. 
 Where are your car keys? 
 What? 
 Your car keys! 
 Downstairs! It's in the drawer in the kitchen. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Where are you going to? 
 She told you where the car keys are. 
 So? 
 Come on. 
 Let's have some fun. 
 Hey... 
 Tie these two up. 
 Wrists and ankles this time. 
 The boy can watch. 
 Car keys... 
 Car keys... 
 We really should get going, man. 
 That alarm could go off any minute. 
 Shut up. 
 Cop. 
 Cop? What are you talking about? 
 First, we're gonna have some fun with that woman, and then I'll show you how we have a really good time. 
 Bring that bitch down. 
 Here! Down on the floor! 
 Police! Drop your weapons! 
 Get on the floor. 
 Get on the floor! 
 Maybe you ought to drop yours, lady. 
 Eva, don't. 
 You've got three seconds. 
 They will kill them. 
 You got that right, Bash. 
 One! 
 Two! 
 Don't do it, Eva. 
 Three! 
 Sebastian! Sebastian! Sebastian! 
 You got him, mate. You got him. 
 He's done. He's done. 
 Are you okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 We got them. 
 You did great, man. 
 It's over now. 
 Bingo. 
 Jesuss Look at that. 
 The Essen police just arrested Max, the biker leader, packing to make his escape. 
 Without his drugs? 
 He probably thought he still had this coming. 
 Good job, everyone. 
 Oh, that was all Sebastian. 
 Yeah, where is Bash, anyway? 
 He's on a call. 
 Do we know who he's talking to? 
 Don't know. 
 Must be someone very important, though. 
 No, I know it's early. Is he awake yet? 
 Can I just say hello, please? 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Erik? I told you I'd call. 
 Did you have a good sleep? 
 That's cool. 
 All right. 
 Hey, hey, hey, listen, I hope to see you really soon, okay?
