 [Low laughter] 
 Genovese : Hey! 
 [Shot fires] 
 [Gasps awake] 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 Do you want a coffee? 
 No. I need to get moving as quickly as possible. 
 What do you need them to think? 
 [Sighs] 
 That there is no pressure on Dimitrov at all. 
 Will they believe that? 
 No. 
 Never. 
 But they will believe that I am looking for him in the wrong place. 
 Is he still in Moscow? 
 No, he's about 190 kilometers south, near Tula. 
 Where do you want him to think you are? 
 He has a rather large presence in Poland, so it's logical for me to be there, and I have numerous contacts in Warsaw who will help sell the ruse. 
 Would you actually go there? 
 Yes, of course, and then I will go underground, but anyone who is watching me would believe I am still there. 
 So, I will say we spoke, that you are going to Warsaw and to follow... 
 Yeah, but be careful. 
 Small talk. 
 Just a couple having breakfast. 
 Talk about the... 
 Michel, we know how to talk to each other. 
 Of course. 
 But you must explain that you are moving to the Amsterdam apartment, that you are leaving the French flat empty. 
 How will we know if it works? 
 It will. 
 What if it doesn't? 
 It will. 
 [Knocks] 
 Shari isn't there. 
 She never came home. 
 Do you have any idea where she went? 
 Said she was going by you. 
 Well, if... if you see her, would you tell her that I came by? 
 Sure. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 Hey. Hi. 
 What did you do? 
 Excuse me? 
 A number of my files were raided last night. 
 Your files? 
 My computer files! 
 I was hacked. 
 They went through everything. 
 My new device plans, my scangen files, my personal files, everything. 
 Why are you mad at me? 
 Because I traced them, Eva. 
 The attack came from Italy... 
 From the Italian police. 
 [Slams door] 
 [Sharp knocking] 
 Hey, garbage guy! 
 [Knocking persistently] Hey! 
 Anybody in there? 
 [In a breathless voice] Yeah. 
 Are you the garbage guy? You the cleaner? 
 When the carnival's open. Sometimes. 
 Oh, well, that's nice, because, uh, some bad stuff happened last night. 
 What bad stuff? 
 Someone knocked over the porta-johns. 
 All of 'em! 
 It's a big mess. 
 I mean, there's two types of people in this world, right? 
 Those that knock the porta-johns over, and those that gotta pick this crap up. 
 Guess which type you are. 
 Yeah, I'll get it, I'll get it. 
 Are you American? 
 What? 
 Are you deaf? 
 What I said was "Are you American?" 
 You sound American to me. 
 Yeah, I'm from all over. I'm a mutt. 
 Okay, mutt. All right. 
 Start cleaning this crap up! 
 Stinky poo-poo! Everywhere! 
 I can smell it from here! 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Yeah? - Who is this? 
 Who is this? 
 Inspector Seeger. 
 Whom am I speaking to, please? 
 Did you say "Inspector"? 
 Yes, sir. 
 What do you do? 
 What do I do? I work for the ICC. 
 The criminal court? 
 And, uh, can I look that up somewhere? 
 Excuse me? 
 Verify it. 
 Well, you can look at the name plate on my desk. 
 What time? 
 What department do you work for? 
 North Holland. The Netherlands. 
 Yeah, well, how about this, Inspector North Holland? 
 How about you tell me why the hell you're calling me? 
 Oh. 
 Of course. 
 Rude of me. 
 Because I'm standing over a dead woman in an alley and yours is the last number she dialed on her cell phone.

New Scars, Old Wounds, Part 1 
Originally Aired August 18, 2013 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Anne-Marie! 
 [Phone continues ringing] 
 Anne-Marie, answer your bloody phone! 
 [Continues ringing] 
 McConnell. 
 In French : Oui, bonjour. Vous parlez Francais? 
 Only enough to order over-priced wine. 
 Excusez-moi? 
 No Francais. 
 Okay, I'm looking for Detective Sergeant San? 
 Anne-Marie? She's not here. What do you need? 
 I have been expecting a report  from the arrests she made the other night. 
 And you're a cop? 
 Yes, from her old unit in Lyon. 
 Listen, we have two men in holding we must release soon without reports. 
 I'm sure she'll be in any time. 
 What's your name? 
 Tell her it's Pare... 
 Francois Pare from Lyon. 
 She has the number. It's her old desk. 
 All right, mate. Cheers. 
 See here? 
 This is the I.P. address of the computer that hacked mine. 
 It's based in Rome. 
 How close can you trace it? 
 How close? 
 Yeah. Can you locate the actual computer? 
 Why? 
 So I know who it was before I call and scream at someone. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So you're saying you have no idea who did this? 
 Yeah, I'm saying that I have no idea. 
 Because remember, you said you were going to tell them about me? 
 I also remember that I told you, Sebastian, that I was joking, remember? 
 I don't know how close I can get to the specific computer. 
 Every time I try, I get kicked out of their system. 
 It's like it's just waiting for me to retaliate. 
 So how can that be? 
 Somehow, they have all of my information, and are set up specifically to track my usage. 
 They can shadow me almost anywhere on the web. 
 I'll handle it. 
 They have personal information, Eva. 
 Very personal. 
 Yeah. 
 I got it. I said I'll handle it. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Berger. 
 Sebastian, I need your help with something. 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. Breakfast? 
 Just a cup of tea. 
 Did you sleep well? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Did you sleep well? 
 Yes. I slept fine. 
 I did not. 
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Do you know why? 
 No. 
 It's because I saw Dorn yesterday. 
 Did you? 
 Yeah. 
 He found Dimitrov. He's going to Poland. 
 Poland? 
 Outside Warsaw. 
 That's where he believes he can catch him. 
 That's great news. 
 I know. 
 When will he be going? 
 Today. 
 Good. 
 This is almost over, Rebecca. 
 It's almost over. 
 Yes... 
 [Slams phone down] 
 [Eva cursing in Italian] 
 [Whistles appreciatively] 
 Wow, that sounds hot. 
 Everything sounds hot to you. 
 I don't mean like that. 
 I mean, it sounds like you're pissed off. 
 Well, I am pissed off because nobody at my old office ever answers the phone. 
 What is it with everyone and their old offices today? 
 [Sighing] What do you mean? 
 One of Anne-Marie's mates from Lyon called earlier about some arrest report she never did. 
 That doesn't sound like Anne-Marie. 
 I know. 
 Have you talked to her at all? 
 She wasn't here yesterday, and I haven't seen her today. 
 No. Maybe Hickman knows where she is. 
 They spend a lot of time together. 
 Where is he? 
 Sebastian went to meet him somewhere, with the scangen. 
 A crime scene? 
 I guess so. 
 How come no one ever tells me anything? 
 Hickman : All I know for sure is that there's a dead woman. 
 And if it's who I think it is, it's not going to be from natural causes. 
 Who do you think it is? 
 Someone I know... intimately. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 But how do you... 
 Whether it is her, or it isn't, I asked you to come here because I want to help these folks have every advantage in figuring out who did this. 
 Sure. 
 I can't imagine the North Holland P.D. 
 Has a whole heck of a lot of resources. 
 Do you have any idea who might have wanted to hurt her? 
 Not yet. 
 You've got everything you need? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you sure you want to come back with me to Amsterdam? 
 I'm sure. 
 I'm bored of waiting around here for you to come home. 
 Let's go, then. 
 [Shutters clicking] 
 Are you Hickman? 
 Inspector Seeger? 
 Arabela, please. 
 Arabela, this is Sebastian Berger. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I work with Sebastian at the ICC. 
 Sebastian brought along some very special investigative equipment. 
 It might be helpful. 
 Helpful? 
 Evidence identification and collection. 
 We don't need any help. 
 Well, you never know, right? 
 Wrong. 
 This way, please. 
 [Shutters clicking] 
 Do you know this woman? 
 Oh, my God. 
 She's not... 
 It's not who I thought it was going to be. 
 But you do know her? 
 She's pretty disfigured, but yeah. 
 Yes or no? 
 Yes. Her name is Anika. 
 She's a bank manager in Amsterdam. 
 Do you recognize her? I doubt her mother would recognize her.[i] 
 I hope she doesn't have to. 
 It's the bank manager. 
 From the robbery. 
 The one that outed you as a cop? 
 Yeah. 
 Really? 
 I would have never... are you sure? 
 Yeah, it's her. 
 It's Anika. 
 Why would she call you? 
 That's the same thing I was going to ask. 
 A 10-second call was the last thing on her cell. 
 A 10-second call to you. 
 Give us a minute. 
 I'm sorry, was that a question? 
 Is it true? 
 You already know it is. 
 If you're going to try to catch someone in a lie, ask the question before you give them the answer. 
 Okay... 
 What did she want? 
 10 seconds doesn't mean we talked, only that she dialed my phone. 
 You're saying the call didn't connect? 
 I'm saying you have no evidence that it did. 
 "This is Hickman. I'll call you back." 
 Come again? 
 Your no-frills outgoing message takes less than two seconds. 
 That leaves an eight-second window. 
 A hang-up would have resulted in a three-second call. 
 That's not evidence. 
 True. 
 But her cellular provider already verified the call went through. 
 There you go. 
 I had a feeling you had more. 
 A connection was made. 
 It's still not proof that we talked. 
 Are you saying you didn't? 
 That's private. 
 I'm sorry? 
 What we talked about has to do with an ongoing investigation. 
 Into what? 
 Sorry. 
 That's unfortunate. 
 No, what's unfortunate is that you think I had something to do with this murder. 
 I don't believe I ever said that. 
 You know what, I just got tired of your game. 
 I'm not finished. 
 I only came here because I thought your victim was someone that I'm close to. 
 That does not describe me and Anika. 
 I have nothing else for you. 
 How long has the other woman been missing? 
 I didn't say she was missing. 
 No, but I told you I was standing over a dead woman. 
 If you thought it was the person you're close to, she must be missing. 
 Two missing women, with you in common. 
 That's unfortunate. 
 If you're going to arrest me, then why don't you do that? 
 Otherwise, I'm going to back my office at The Hague. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Carl Hickman, you're under arrest for the murder of Anika Hauten. 
 [Sighing] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Yes? 
 Louis? 
 [i]It's done. They will think you are going to Poland. I'm on my way to the airport now. We're on the train. We're going to Amsterdam together. For now. I'm sorry? Good luck, Dorn, and thank you for taking this for us... For Etienne. Don't thank me until I've succeeded. I have faith. Let's hope it's not misplaced. It's not. I will tell her. Call me when you can. I'll call you when I get back. [Sighs] He sends you love. Will he be all right? What do you want me to tell you, the truth? Yes. You want the truth, but you lied to him this morning. I lied? Yeah. You told him that we know how to talk to each other. But we don't. Not anymore. You're not going to believe this. What's up? Hickman asked me to go to a crime scene with him, to gather some evidence. Is that a case for us? No. It's a single murder. How is Hickman involved? They arrested him for it. You're kidding. They arrested Hickman for murder? The victim is that bank manager, the one that outed him as a cop during the robbery. Is that why they think he did it? I'm not sure the detective even knew that. All she said was that the bank manager made a phone call to Hickman before she died. That doesn't seem like a whole lot of evidence. No. Wasn't the woman at the bank blonde? Yeah. Very blonde. Well, this woman had dark hair. She dyed it? Apparently, but... how would Hickman know that? He recognized the body straight away. The hair colour didn't even seem to surprise him. And why would she call him? [Cell phone rings] Major Daniel. It's Eva. When does your train arrive? About an hour. Why? Hickman has been arrested. What? Yeah. Arrested. When? Just now. I'll be there as soon as I can. What is it? I won't be able to go to the Amsterdam apartment with you. [Sighs] Is that supposed to be a surprise? Oh, please. Could you just, once, be understanding? For once? Yeah. Hickman has been arrested... I don't... I don't care. Well, I do. I have to. Fine. I'm going back to Paris. Excuse me? On the next train back. Our flat is still bugged. Well, if they want to listen to me pack, they can listen. We said we are going to Amsterdam together. We've said many things many times, Louis. The plans always change, and always end with me in that apartment, alone. If they've been listening, they know that, too. This will not seem odd to them in the least. This is my job, all right? My job! [Clears throat awkwardly] What? What! What do you want me to do, just ignore it? All I ever asked was for a little balance. Balance. Yes. That's not the reason why you hate me. I don't hate you. Yes, you do. You blame me for Etienne. Oh, please. You think I don't see it in your eyes every time you look at me? I've never blamed you. [Laughs mirthlessly] Do you remember this morning I told you I didn't sleep well? The truth is I haven't slept well once since that night. I have the same dream. I come home, our house is burning, and you are on the ground, with Etienne in your arms. And you keep saying something to me, over and over. Do you remember... what you said to me that night? [Whispers] "What did you do?" What did I do? What did I do? So, you can leave me in this hell, you can divorce me if you want. You can get on with your life if you want. Just don't tell me it's because of my team, or my job. Not only do I work for the ICC, I'm a former NYPD detective. Do you really believe that I murdered this woman? I want to show you some things, and when I'm finished, I'm going to ask you one question. One? One. A few weeks ago, you were a hostage in a bank robbery, during which my homicide victim... a fellow hostage... informed the robbers that you are an officer and put you in grave danger. The robbers then found a hypodermic kit on you, exposing you as a drug abuser. My victim then filed an official statement with Amsterdam Chief Helstrom and, apparently, also with your boss at The Hague, Major Daniel, attesting to your drug use. I can't imagine this went well for you. A week later, after the robbery, my victim reported 100,000 Euro missing from the vault, despite the fact that every other witness reported the perpetrators never took any money and none was found on them during their arrest. After that, you went to my victim's flat for six minutes. Then you left. She exited a few minutes later in a great hurry with two bags, one of which was found at the murder scene. She went to the bank, where she was no longer employed, illegally accessed their computer systems and closed an account, an account held by a traveling carnival, which winters outside of Amsterdam, where you work and live. The 10-second phone call she made to you was 15 minutes after closing this account. She was then found beaten to death with what my examiner is calling tremendous rage by a person who knew her, and you refuse to tell me what the phone call she made to you was about. Finally, while you were with me at the homicide scene, my colleagues found, behind the trailer you reside in, the other piece of luggage she left with. It had a compartment ripped out of it at some point. I don't know what was in it, but 100,000 Euro is a pretty good guess. Are you finished? Yes. What's your question? What would you do if you were me? I'd lock me up. 
 
 Do we know anything new. We waited for you. Where is Anne-Marie? We don't know. She never came in. One of her old colleagues says they're waiting for a report from her on some prisoners. Major Daniel? Yeah. I'm Commander Bergen. They told me you were coming. Hi. Where is Hickman? He's fine. Why don't we talk in my office? Come on. All right. A 20-year homicide detective murders an acquaintance, leaving behind a Mountain of circumstantial evidence, and then props the perfect piece of physical evidence against the back wall of his home. So, you don't think I did it? Not anymore. Well then, what the hell am I doing here? My boss doesn't quite understand the concept. I need something to change my commander's mind. What can I do? Tell me about the phone call, or the investigation it was about. Give me a logical explanation for any of this. I'm sorry. You'd rather go to jail than tell me about your investigation? If those are my only choices. I need to get out of here, inspector. I told you, there's a woman. The missing woman? Apparently so. Inspector? Can you bring your files? Now? Yes, sir. I'll be back. I'll be waiting. [Eva speaks Italian] It's almost all circumstantial. Yeah, but that's a lot of bloody circumstance. Did Hickman know that the bank manager made an official statement about his drug use? Yes. How did he find out about the statement? I told him. He asked me. I told him. You told him? Yes. You didn't think it could possibly make him angry with her? No. I don't lie. Not to my team, not to Detective Hickman. Sorry, this is all too perfect. I don't disagree. Eva and Sebastian, go back to the scene, take your scangen, see what you find. Okay. Tommy, go to the morgue, take a look at the body. I love a good autopsy in the morning. I'll take you. I'm going there anyway to check with the medical examiner. [Starts engine] When was the last time you saw her? Leaving the scene to take the rescued women to a shelter in calais. And then? Then I assumed she would go back home to Amsterdam. My investigator says she was supposed to send you reports? And if we don't get them soon, we'll have to let the prisoners go. Okay, listen to me, if you hear anything from Anne-Marie, please let me know immediately. Yes, of course. Thank you. Okay, here we go. What? It's not working properly. What does that mean? No... No, no, no, no... What is it? It's infected. The code seems to be eating itself! What? Damn it! The whole scangen program seems to be affected. I need to get back to the office to access my back-ups! How could that happen? I told you, I was hacked... From Rome. As you can see, there is a tremendous amount of blunt-force trauma about the face. Any idea of the weapon used? We haven't been able to locate any residue to get a material sample. You won't find any weapon residue. Why not? Because that was done with fists. Are you sure? I was a bare knuckle fighter. I am very sure. Is this possible? The killer would have to be very powerful. But it's possible? Oh, definitely. Here's what else I'm sure about. These wounds exclude Hickman. How? Whoever did that, did it with two hands. Left and right. In case you haven't noticed, Hickman can't pick his nose with his right hand, much less punch someone hard enough to do that. What about these gashes? If it was done with fists... A ring. A big one. A ring with an initial. Well, he'll be busy for a bit, then. When he does get back, we've got something very special planned for him. Yes, "we." Me and his little friend here. Mm-hmm. Aw... Yes sir, I'm very sure and the coroner agrees with me. The blows were clearly struck with both hands. Inspector Seeger? Yes, sir? We've located information on the victim's family. You have? They're local, and we'll need them to come down to make a positive identification. Of course. Will you be making the death notification, or would you like us to handle it? No, I'll go. Okay. Least favourite part of the job. I never met a cop who didn't hate it. But, you know, as bad as it is to notify a family someone isn't coming home, it doesn't bother me as much as the unidentified bodies we get. This one, for example. Car accident. Body burnt up. Vehicle burnt up. No plates, no VIN? Coroner is hoping dental records or DNA will help. Imagine waiting for someone to come home who never does, and you'll never know why. I'll go with you if you want, to notify the other victim's family. I'd appreciate that. [Explosion] [Metal and glass crunching] They're releasing you. Why? Tommy proved that the victim was beaten with two hands. First time this ever helped out. The killer was wearing a ring. Monogrammed. With the letter "G." Son of a bitch. I think we need to talk. Not in this building. [Silenced gunshot snipes] [Gunfire] [Shot snipes] [Helicopter whirrs overhead] When? Good. Good. The police let him go. Let's go make a homecoming. Carl! I have to go, Louis. Someone I know may be in trouble. From Phillip Genovese? At the carnival? What did you say? How do you know the name Genovese? That's the guy who hurt you, yes? Was it Anne-Marie? Anne-Marie? Yes, did she tell you about him? She knows? That's why she's gone? Oh, God, no, Louis. I asked her to run his name months ago. Where she is today has nothing to do with that. Well, she never betrayed you. Good, so how do you know? Louis, how do you... You knew the day you came to the carnival. You left people behind in New York, people who care about you. They called me when you moved here. How long were you watching me? I just checked in from time to time. You spied on me. As a friend. That's not good enough. You're probably right. I'm not talking about this right now. Where are you going? I'm going to a carnival, because Genovese is my mess to clean up! I can't let you do that, Carl. Excuse me? You are a member of my team. I can't let you become a vigilante. You know what, you're right. Yes, I am. I quit. No... Sebastian? It's all gone. What is gone? All of my work. My back-up files, it's all gone. How? What am I going to do now? Sebastian, I need you to pull yourself together. Can you do that? [Helicopter whirring overhead] Major said to get back here fast. Yeah, well, he's in with Sebastian now. Where's Hickman? Major says he quit. Seriously? Mm-hmm. I hope that isn't my fault. It's not. But I need your help. Zatrzymaj! Prosze zatrzymaj! If you don't want to be involved, I understand. Are you kidding? I don't get to do something like this too often. Good. Let's get ready. [Cell phone rings] Major Daniel. Louis, thank God. Dorn? It was a set-up, Louis! The whole thing. They knew I was coming. They must have known that we discovered their bugs. You and Rebecca have to go underground. Get out of your Amsterdam apartment  and find somewhere else to stay. But Dorn, she went back to Paris! Shari? Oh, my God. [Clang and clamor of carnival funhouse] [Tinny funhouse music] [Creepy, haunted laughter, screams] Genovese! I'm here! Genovese, over P.A. : I got a pathetic story for you. You know our Dutch bank broad? Anika? She wouldn't cop to who had her close down my bank account, but I knew that she didn't do that on her own. Hickman shouts : You didn't have to kill her! Genovese, over P.A. :  That's beside the point. She's not the first chippy that needed a broken nose before they start talking. I punched her once... And she told me everything. Everything. She robbed the bank, she said I could have the money. And then you know what? You know what she did? She sold you out. She said, "It's Hickman. His name is Carl Hickman!" I couldn't wait for you to find out! I wanted you to know. Genovese :  Yeah, but... I didn't have a clue who Carl Hickman was, man. I mean, I know now. You traveled halfway around the world, to come and get me in that crappy, dump trailer, but I swear to God, I had to search you, man. I didn't have a clue. And you know what? Given our "history" together, Carl, that is pathetic. [Light switch snaps] Did you actually come by yourself? Where's Shari? That's pretty ballsy for a one-armed carnie crap scooper. This is between me and you! No, that changed when you sacrificed little Anika. Leave Shari out of it. She's not a part of it! [Gunshot blasts] She is now, Sport. Come on! And face me, you son of a bitch! [Light switch snaps] [Blow thuds] It's more like a son of a whore, but that was an honest mistake. Did you bring any kids with you? Ah, you got me with that one. [Kicks thud heavily] [Groaning and coughing in pain] A revolver, really? Carl? You really think six bullets is enough to come at me? It only takes one. Shut up. [Coughing] Stop talking. [Groaning in pain] I know you probably can't see this right now 'cause you're also blurry-eyed, but this gun here, this is the one that I used to kill the fortune teller. There's one shot left in the chamber. Oh. Oh, and before I forget. She'd left a message for the police, telling them that when you got back from jail, you were all crazy. You were all, like, wild-eyed and crazy. It was just crazy! Know how I got her to do that? She was a lot stronger than that little Dutch girl, I'll tell you that, but in this case... Not such a good idea for her. [Helicopter whirs] So... You are going to get discovered sooner or later, and you got a lot of explaining to do, right? Um... This right here... [Handcuffs rattling] Just... Smells of sort of murder-suicide, doesn't it? It does. But you're gonna have to drag little miss fortune teller over there to the gun, you have shown a lot of determination in the past. In fact... Let me help you. Little Anika, she told me about another one of your issues. Now, this could be stronger than you're used to, but maybe not. Either way, it's going to help take the edge off what you gotta do. You know, I thought about just killing you, but I kind of did that already, in New York, didn't I? I mean, what could be worse than leaving you to live your life the way you're living it now? Twice. [Mouths silently]
