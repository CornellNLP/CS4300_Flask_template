 Everybody knows, Amélie. 
 Are you serious, mate? 
 Bit early for a game, isn't it? 
 Where the hell are they playing anyway? 
 Japan. Tokyo. 
 Asia? Not even football? 
 Game's a game, right? 
 Not even close. 
 Where is Major Daniel? 
 Uh, I don't know. Maybe he's still at home. 
 No, he's not there, and he's not on his cell. 
 May we have a word? 
 Sure. 
 No, Sebastian. 
 Alone. 
 Oh, right. Sorry. 
 Something wrong, sir? 
 I received an anonymous correspondence. 
 About? 
 Type "ICC scandal" into your computer. 
 The story just broke. 
 We've traced it back to a source within the Italian Police Services. 
 Italian? 
 It will be in all the European newspapers tomorrow. 
 Do you have it? 
 Yup. 
 "... Severe misconduct of a recently established unit... at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. 
 The tech expert of the team, Kriminalkommissar Sebastian Berger, hacked into numerous... " 
 "European police databases." 
 Yeah, but I only collected data which was relevant to our cases... when there was no time to go through official channels. 
 Yeah, and I'm sure that's true, and I will deal with that at the appropriate diplomatic level. 
 If that were the extent of it, I would not be concerned... 
 It's very early for a football match. 
 The game must be important. 
 It's only on while I update my files. I was barely even watching. 
 Do you have a gambling problem? 
 I don't have... no, I don't have a problem. 
 I used to, but I've given it up. 
 When? 
 When? 
 When did you give it up? 
 Before you came to the ICC, or did you gamble from these offices? 
 I don't see how it matters when... 
 30,000 Euro! 
 Excuse me? 
 I was also copied with a transcript of files... that show that you owed a gambling debt of 30,000 Euro, which you cleared with a single payment. 
 Where did you get the money? 
 I... 
 That's... 
 It's personal. 
 That is your answer? 
 Not a whiff of corruption must touch this court or the vital work that is done in these offices. 
 Not the slightest smell of it. 
 And an investigator making the salary that you make who suddenly has 30,000 Euro to pay off an illegal gambling debt... is not a whiff. 
 That stinks to high heaven. 
 That is why "when" matters. 
 Yeah, but... 
 Kommissar Berger, you are hereby informed that you are under an internal investigation by the ICC into bribery, corruption, extortion, illegal gambling, and your activities are restricted to these offices. 
 You are not to leave, do you understand? 
 Yeah. 
 EVERY IS GOING TO KNOW, STEFAN Crooked. It's just crooked! 
 You cannot mean that. 
 I most certainly do, Rebecca. 
 We have an obligation to protect the Court, to protect its integrity. 
 Michel, the Court is stronger than... 
 No! 
 I asked those judges to trust me with this idea of Louis, and they did, and now the trust that they've placed in me has put their reputation in jeopardy, the reputation of this entire body! 
 Whether we like or not, the team is the public face of the ICC. 
 Oh, dammit. I have to go to Serbia. 
 I'll be back at the end of the day tomorrow. 
 I want you to monitor the investigation. 
 If you suspect that Berger has done anything even remotely illegal, I want to know about it immediately. 
 To prosecute him? 
 To the fullest extent of the law. 
 All right, two minutes. 
 I told you, you don't need to. 
 And I told you I want to. 
 More coffee? 
 I can get it. 
 All right, here we go. 
 Bacon, eggs, and toast. 
 All-American breakfast, coming up. 
 Come on, just a couple bites. 
 The doctor... the doctor told me to tell him if your appetite... 
 My appetite is fine. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You need to go to work. 
 I guess I do. 
 I do, I'm sorry. 
 What time will you be... finished? 
 Late. 
 I have an appointment with a... a realtor, a listing agent. 
 I'm thinking of renting a flat. 
 Like a real, permanent flat? 
 More permanent than this. 
 A flat sounds nice. 
 Yeah. 
 Hiya, Seeger. 
 What are you looking at me like that for? 
 You haven't read the papers? 
 Papers? Who wants to read a load of shite first thing in the... ? 
 What? Where is he? 
 In his lab with Eva. 
 Tommy, wait. 
 You haven't read the whole thing. 
 Whatever! 
 Well, they can't say that you're corrupt. 
 I told them. 
 They weren't convinced. 
 Convinced of what? 
 Sebastian is up on a corruption charge. 
 Because of this shite? 
 It's my own fault. 
 Why are you biting the bullet on this? 
 Everything you did was sanctioned. 
 The Major knew you were going into those files. 
 I don't remember him worrying about it back then. 
 The databases aren't the problem. 
 I told you, you didn't read the whole article. 
 He was gambling, too. At work. 
 Sorry, Sebastian. 
 How did they find out? 
 I kept the records. All my wins, all my losses. Stupid. 
 I created this mess. 
 What are you going on about? 
 I told my former colleagues about his hacking. 
 You did what? 
 Tommy, it's all right. 
 Why the hell would you do that? 
 Because I wanted to make sure they did a security check. 
 That's even stupider than him keeping the files in his computer! 
 Can you lower your voice, please? 
 Please, guys! 
 Let's let everyone else fight about this. 
 I've got enough without that on my conscience. 
 What if they kick you out? 
 They wouldn't do that. 
 Wouldn't they? 
 What the hell would we do then? 
 We use that damned ScanGen for everything. 
 Well, I can show you how to use it. 
 Yeah, as if I'd ever be able to... 
 No, no, no, I meant Arabela and... 
 Yeah, well, they might be able to... 
 Where would you go? 
 Home, I guess. 
 What do you mean, you'd go home? 
 Berlin. 
 You already know? 
 Kathrin? 
 Know what? 
 That I need your help in Berlin? 
 Let me get this straight. You want us take a look at these suicides? 
 Last night was the third this month. 
 Two in Berlin, one in Munich. 
 All young adults who seemingly had everything to live for. 
 A gifted student scientist already being honored for his work. 
 A musician on the brink of recording an album. 
 And last night, Amélie Weurfel, a girl who graduated with honors on her way to a major university. 
 By all accounts, the most popular girl in her school. 
 Well, she jumped 40 meters from a rooftop to an asphalt car park. 
 Suicide does not fall under our mandate. 
 Normally, I would agree. This isn't normal. 
 Are you saying you think they were all murdered? 
 Every indication is that they were all physically alone at the time of their death. 
 Physically alone? 
 This is Amélie's phone. 
 It was recovered at the scene, but wasn't found near her. 
 It appears she threw it before she jumped from that roof. 
 We processed it. 
 The circuitry inside has been... fried. 
 Remotely. 
 Is that even possible? 
 Yeah. 
 So you think it was working when she went up there. 
 And after, someone erased what was on it. 
 All three victims had phones at the scenes, all fried the same way. 
 I believe someone is using the internet to influence these kids into killing themselves. 
 The time between suicides is getting shorter with each one. 
 Only four days between the last two. 
 If I'm right, there may be someone out there right now we could save. 
 And they may not even know yet that they need help. 
 Come on... 
 Naughty, naughty, Stefan. 
 How did you get that video? 
 Very naughty. 
 But you must have hacked me. 
 That video, it's not what you... 
 It isn't what it looks like! 
 Then you won't mind it going public? 
 You can't show this to anyone! Please! 
 I'm going to show everyone. 
 Everyone will know. 
 Please... 
 There is a phenomenon called "Cluster Suicides"... when people belong to the same group. Could this be that? 
 We looked for a connection, there's nothing on the surface. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Different schools, different social groups. 
 All they had in common is they were successful and had a lot of friends. 
 Doesn't sound much like typical suicides. 
 I have the case files in my office. 
 Is he all right? 
 Who? 
 I saw the paper on the way here. 
 Yeah. 
 He's actually fine. 
 He's not as concerned as you'd think. 
 Yes. That sounds like Sebastian. 
 There are definitely files removed. Destroyed, really. 
 Like a bomb went off inside. 
 There's a fragment of a trail, but I need a full IP, and the target device to trace it back. 
 Then could you restore the files? 
 Maybe. 
 Why should he? 
 Why should he what? 
 Why should he do anything for the ICC? 
 Because it's his job. 
 Do you not know what's going on here, man? 
 I know that he's being investigated, yeah. 
 They're trying to screw him is what they're doing. 
 Tommy, stay out of this. 
 Are you corrupt, Sebastian? 
 Did you take a bribe to pay off the debt? 
 A bribe? 
 He paid off a very large debt, and they'd like to know where the money came from. 
 How large? 
 30,000. 
 30,000? 
 Where the hell did you get the money? 
 Look, I didn't get it illegally, and, no, I never took a bribe. 
 Then let them investigate. A good cop gets investigated all the time. 
 I had a boss who used to get rid of anyone didn't have an Internal Affairs beef at least once a year. 
 And? 
 What's he supposed to do? 
 What I didn't do was to take it out on potential murder victims. 
 Look, are you going to tell them where the money came from? 
 I don't think they have a right to ask. 
 Then that's your decision. Live with it. 
 And until they tell you you can't, you do your job. 
 For them. 
 The team will only do background investigations on the victims until I get your call. 
 Yes, Dorn. Thank you. 
 Hello, my love. 
 You have a new case? 
 Yes. 
 Someone may be using the internet to convince people to commit suicide. 
 That's awful. 
 Where? 
 In Germany. 
 I'm fairly certain suicide isn't a crime in Germany. 
 We're not going after the victims, only the one convincing them. 
 But can inducing someone to do something that isn't a crime be a crime? 
 In this case, it should be. 
 I'll research it back at my office. 
 Thank you. So now... what can I do for you? 
 I came to warn you. 
 Michel told me about Sebastian Berger. 
 He wants him prosecuted. 
 No, he does not. 
 Louis, he was very clear. 
 He wants the Court protected. 
 That's a very different thing. 
 Well, if your Sebastian did anything wrong, there will be a prosecution. 
 I don't believe he did what it looks like he did. 
 So it's nothing then? 
 I did not say that. 
 Sir? Sorry. I'm sorry to bother. 
 No, I was leaving. 
 Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, Eva. 
 Yeah. 
 What do you need? 
 Well, we've done all we can here, so Arabela and I thought we might go to Berlin and see what we can find there. 
 Let's hold any travel until Sebastian finishes his work. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sir? 
 Yes. 
 If the only problem is where Sebastian got his money to pay his debt... 
 I gave it to him. 
 You did? 
 Yeah. 
 I saved up money for a holiday. 
 But Sebastian didn't tell me that? 
 Well, I guess he didn't want me to be involved. 
 Should I make a statement? 
 No. It won't be necessary right now. 
 Sebastian found something. 
 Among the items erased from the phone... was a series of photos and webcam videos. 
 This is the jumper. 
 How long do we have? 
 She won't be home for an hour. 
 She was definitely waiting for him. 
 Do they know they're being filmed? 
 They don't act like it. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That's her mother's boyfriend. 
 Sweetie, sweetie. 
 I recovered more than 300 text messages threatening to send this recording to everyone, her friends in school and, of course, her mother. 
 Last message was at 0722. 
 Coroner estimated her death at 0720. 
 He texted her while she was on the roof? 
 Didn't want her to change her mind. 
 Which is why she threw the phone. 
 She was harassed into killing herself. 
 Can you identify who sent the texts? 
 I can tell you the name, but it's only a screen name. 
 "Sensenmann". 
 It's German. It means, "Grim Reaper". 
 We are going to Berlin. 
 What, me too? 
 I doubt there's anyone else who could solve this. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Sebastian! 
 How are you? 
 Uh, not my desk any longer. 
 Wow, when? 
 Last month. 
 "Polizeihau" what? 
 She's been made Chief Inspector. 
 Like a boss? 
 Like the boss. 
 Congratulations, Chief Inspector. 
 Thank you, Major Daniel. 
 I need to call the au pair, and then we can get started. 
 Oh, yeah. How is the little guy? 
 Eric. 
 Right. Eric. 
 He's amazing. I'll be back. 
 Now, Carl and Arabela, talk to the last victim's mother and her friend? 
 The creep? 
 The witness. Don't make it personal. 
 Sure. 
 Tommy and Eva, go through the other victim's files and see if there is anything. 
 All right. 
 Yeah, I have the street address of the IP that sent the video file. 
 He needed a lot of bandwidth for that. 
 It's from an internet cafe not far from here. 
 I'll go with you. 
 Can I go? 
 It's a lead I should be part of. 
 Please. 
 Thank you. 
 You're trying to make me look good, aren't you? 
 I'm expecting a call. 
 You're lucky the scouts aren't coming today instead of tomorrow. 
 EVERYBODY WILL KNOW PLEASE DON'T DO THIS EVERYBODY WILL KNOW We're sorry to have to talk to you at such a terrible time. 
 You are from the ICC? 
 The Criminal Court? 
 Yes. A special investigative unit. 
 For suicide? 
 I asked you not to use that word. 
 But she... 
 Sorry, darling. 
 We're interested in Amélie's acquaintances. 
 Her friends? 
 More people she might not want to share secrets with. 
 Secrets? 
 What secrets does she have? 
 We don't mean anything specific. 
 You don't believe it was a suicide. 
 We do believe she hurt herself. 
 We're just trying to understand why. 
 Could we speak alone for a moment? 
 Why him? 
 He's not her father. 
 I know. 
 It's me. 
 I'm the one that wants to be alone, Madame. 
 I asked my partner to occupy your... Mr. Keppel. 
 Why? 
 So... we may speak freely as women, about Amélie. 
 Maybe you could show me her room? 
 It might be helpful. 
 Okay. 
 This way. 
 You look tired. 
 Ever tactful, Sebastian. 
 I don't mean it badly. 
 So it's a good tired? 
 Well, your new job must not be easy. 
 Well, being responsible for all the investigations is intense. 
 More than I thought it would be. 
 We have three open homicides, two armed robbery patterns, and an unsolved home invasion tied to a series of them in Essen, and I can't find a single piece of evidence. 
 And you still have time to work these suicides? 
 Well, everyone deserves to be considered. 
 Let me ask you, did... 
 Amélie have anyone who really didn't like her? I mean... 
 I mean, serious dislike. 
 She was very popular. 
 Look, I'm not passing judgment. You're all consenting adults. 
 It's kinda creepy, and a lot shitty, but it's your life. 
 I don't follow. 
 Amélie was being harassed by someone who hacked into her webcam on her laptop. 
 They took videos. 
 Recorded what was happening, and then threatened to expose her by making the videos public. It's why she... hurt herself. 
 Expose her? What was there to expose? 
 I want you to listen to me very carefully. 
 They remotely controlled... the camera in her laptop and recorded what was happening in front of it. 
 And where was her laptop kept? 
 Oh, no. Oh, no... It wasn't... 
 Did she know someone who would threaten to make those videos public? 
 Your... The other cop, is she... 
 No. 
 She is not telling Amélie's mother any of this. 
 God knows she's had a rough enough time. 
 I'm going to take that laptop. 
 We'll have someone analyze it. 
 We... we didn't... 
 It was only... 
 We... we loved each other. 
 I don't really care, pal. 
 You're the one that has to look in the mirror. 
 The videos were definitely sent from here. 
 Would they have to know each other? 
 Not at all. 
 How would the person sending the file know where to send it? 
 Well, every person in here on a device is broadcasting their personal information. 
 It's there for the taking, if you know where to look. 
 And where is that? 
 There's a server inside this cafe. 
 It's providing the Wi-Fi everybody is attached to. 
 But your device has to talk to it, making your unique identity vulnerable to anyone who can hack into that Wi-Fi. 
 Is it hard to do? 
 I just did it. 
 With a proper laptop, you can gather everyone's passwords, log-in's, personal information... 
 That's what got you in the paper. 
 But not what got me in trouble. 
 Come on, I have enough to trace the sender. 
 Already? 
 I'm not just pretty. 
 Yes, Dorn, I will let you know what we find. 
 Sebastian is here. 
 Because we need him here. 
 Yes, I'm sure. 
 Thank you very much, Dorn. 
 
 
 
 Yes? 
 Sorry, I was just waiting for you to get off. 
 Dorn got the authorization to look further. 
 I guess they still trust us then. 
 It means they trust Dorn. 
 Did you find something? 
 The victim's don't appear to have known each other. 
 Why would you harass a perfect stranger? 
 It's lucky we have Sebastian. 
 Never would have got this far without him. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah. 
 The money that Sebastian came up with? 
 Don't tell him I told you, but I gave it to him. 
 Did you? 
 Aye. 
 With my family history, he probably wants it kept a secret, but that's the story. 
 Well, we will talk about this back home. 
 I can make a statement... 
 No, Tommy. At home. 
 Well, that wasn't strange at all. 
 They... are in love. 
 That poor mother. 
 Did you... ? Did you tell her? 
 Tell her? No, of course not. 
 God... 
 Imagine knowing your daughter killed herself not to hurt you. 
 She loved her, I could feel it. 
 If Amélie had the courage to tell her, it probably just would have blown over. 
 Well, I guess sometimes it's hard... to see past the trouble right in front of you. 
 Hi. 
 How did it go? 
 Her laptop. 
 That's good. 
 With the IPs I got at the cafe, I should be able to trace he path back to its origin. 
 Can we use your office? 
 Sure. 
 He's good. 
 The best. 
 No... Please... no... 
 I have it. 
 Where is he? 
 The messages are coming from Denmark. 
 Copenhagen. His name is Anttis. 
 Tommy, watch out here, especially the windows. 
 Computer nerds don't run, do they? 
 They certainly don't fight. 
 Very amusing. 
 Police! 
 Is it the music? 
 No. 
 Yes. It is the music. 
 Shoot him. If you need a statement, knock. 
 Thanks for being a good citizen. 
 Popular with his neighbors. 
 Police! 
 Die, you orc scum! 
 Hey pal! Hey! 
 What? 
 Police! Stop! 
 What the hell? 
 Don't move. 
 They found the computer guy... 
 Damn, I'm sorry. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 So you haven't been hacking into web cameras, threatening people? 
 Never. 
 The transmissions were traced here. Text messages? 
 You said you were looking for a hacker, right? 
 They must have hacked me, too. 
 We can trace everything back to you. No sense denying. 
 Rebecca. 
 Two things. 
 Number one, the judges want you and Michel to explain what happened with Sebastian. 
 As soon as this case is finished. 
 No, they want you to come today. This evening. 
 You said two things. 
 Yes. 
 Suicide hasn't been illegal in Germany since the 1700s. 
 You'd have a hard time winning conviction on anything other than simple harassment, if that. 
 Maybe some computer hacking charges. 
 Though they are not clearly defined in international law. 
 In any case, certainly not murder, or accessory to. 
 Probably why the subject does not seem worried. 
 What do you mean, threatening? 
 I'm sorry? 
 You just said "sent threatening texts". 
 What exactly did they say? 
 What were these so-called threats? 
 The threat is to expose the victim's secrets. 
 If it's true, how is that a threat? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, if you simply tell someone... you're going to expose a secret, how is that a threat? 
 So we are hoping someone at the internet cafe knows the computer guy? 
 They just, sent me a text message. He looks pretty memorable. 
 About what you saw in my office. 
 You don't have to explain to me. 
 My son called. 
 He doesn't understand why I have to work so much. 
 He will one day. 
 This keyboard shouldn't even be working with all this sticky stuff all over it. 
 I had a boss once say a good cop always washes his hands before he pisses. 
 Same boss who fired guys for not getting investigated? 
 Different boss. 
 Why does that logo look so familiar? 
 We have a problem here. 
 There's a bunch of new texts to someone named Stefan... sent through this machine, but they didn't originate here, and the IP of the recipient is coded. 
 Sebastian, for tech dummies, what does that mean? 
 There's a new victim I can't identify, and the real hacker could be anywhere. 
 Wow, it's almost more busy now than it was in the middle of the day. 
 It's an online world. 
 I don't even have a computer at home. 
 Seriously? 
 That's surprising? 
 Well, it's none of my business, but Eva, she said you and Sebastian, you were kind of like an item. 
 And computers were just one of the things we didn't have in common. 
 I got it. 
 Excuse me, have you seen this man? 
 Well, you practically confessed. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Is that right? 
 No. 
 I was just asking how... saying you're going to do something without demanding a specific reaction is a threat. 
 What do you mean, specific reaction? 
 An "or else"? 
 I'm going to punch you in the mouth. 
 What? 
 I didn't say, "or else". Do you still feel threatened? 
 Eva. 
 Yeah. 
 I have to go back to The Hague. 
 The judges want to talk to me. 
 Is it about Sebastian? 
 Yes. 
 Do you know him? 
 The texts use your system as a proxy. 
 Yeah. 
 They come from outside your network, but there's no way you didn't see them. 
 No way you didn't know they were being sent. 
 These are new texts. Who is Stefan? Is that your next victim? 
 His replies are getting more desperate. 
 Are you going to let him die, too? 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Put your hand down. 
 How the hell is any of this illegal? 
 Guys... 
 He's right. 
 Rebecca just called. We have nothing to arrest him on. 
 I don't care, you should see these texts. 
 The new victim is getting very desperate, Louis. 
 Can you track where he is? 
 Excuse me, have you seen this man? 
 Sebastian, what are you doing? 
 I cloned Antti's drive. 
 I can see anything that goes through it in almost real time. 
 There are more messages going out to Stefan right now. 
 How can it not be illegal? 
 If suicide is not illegal, causing someone to do it is not either. 
 So it's okay to convince someone to face-plant into a car park, but the ICC wants you to go after Sebastian cause he lost a bunch of his own money? 
 Or someone else's. 
 Right, someone else's. 
 No... 
 What? 
 He just got a new message with instructions on how to make a noose. 
 Carl. 
 Yeah. 
 I have to go back to The Hague. 
 I heard. 
 You need anything? 
 I think it will be all right. 
 Well, let me know. 
 Yes. 
 What kind of person sends a strange instructions on making a noose? 
 Son of a bitch! 
 What? 
 That's the same. 
 It's the same as the sticker, the button that we saw in his apartment. 
 Antti and Amélie must have gone to the same summer camp. 
 Erlebnis Camp, Wiesenfelden... 
 No one recognizes him. 
 Half of them didn't really look. 
 Too engrossed in their virtual world to be bothered by people dying in the real one. 
 Cross-referencing Amélie Weurfel and Erlebnis Camp. 
 Here, she's listed as an alumni, four years ago. 
 She would have been 14. 
 Type in Gross. Martin Gross. 
 He's another one of the victims. 
 Yup, he's here, too. Same time. 
 Here's a list of the campers from then. 
 Do we have a Stefan? 
 Stefan Hoster. His address is here in Berlin. 
 Any chance he still lives there? 
 A 19-year-old still living with his parents? Pretty damned good. 
 What's that? 
 Something's being sent to Stefan. 
 Oh, no. 
 Sebastian? 
 Yeah, we're back. 
 Listen, are you still at the cafe? 
 We're just leaving. 
 He's sending a video right now! 
 What? 
 Someone at the cafe is uploading a video through the Wi-Fi. 
 It will take some time at the speed they have to work with. 
 Look at any of the screens that are open. 
 They'll have a status bar filling up. 
 Okay... 
 We have a possible line on the new victim, too. 
 I'm on my way to you with Tommy, the rest of the team are going to his house. 
 Okay. 
 I hope you know what a status bar looks like. 
 This is it. 
 Who? 
 Can you stop the upload? 
 I can try. 
 Keep an eye on him. 
 He's not going to be happy... 
 What are you doing? 
 That's my computer. 
 It is? 
 Kommissar Eichholtz, LKA. 
 You're the police? 
 What is your name? 
 Anka. Jostun. 
 No, leave me alone. Stop it. 
 Please... 
 Anka, we know what you've been doing. 
 Do you? 
 It needs to stop. 
 Not yet. 
 You need to tell me how to delete this upload. 
 And why would I do that? 
 Because Stefan might hurt himself. 
 Well, I hope he does. 
 You hope he does? 
 Anka, you've caused a lot of people to hurt themselves. 
 Not a lot. Four. 
 Do you know who they are? 
 What they did? 
 It doesn't matter what they did... 
 Well, it matters to me! 
 My parents, they made him go all the way to Germany for summer camp. 
 He was alone in a strange country, and all he wanted was to be their friend. 
 They were the popular kids there, and they let him think that they liked him, they let him hang out with them. 
 He was a fat, pimply-faced boy who never had any friends, and they made him feel like he was special that summer. 
 Amélie even pretended to be into him romantically, and he actually believed her. 
 He sent letters home that summer, about how he had fallen in love. 
 In love! 
 She played him perfectly. 
 She even let him hold her hand, and they took pictures of that, a pathetic nobody holding the hand of the prettiest girl he had ever seen, and that's where Stefan came in, the worst of them all. 
 Peter couldn't see her face when the picture was taken, but he did later, when Stefan posted it all over the internet, his naked body displayed for the joke. 
 Pictures of him cleaning up after them... just looking at Amélie when she was doing something. 
 It was love in his eyes, but Stefan, he made it look... dirty, sick. 
 The shy kid who had made it through life by pretending not to be there, he was suddenly everywhere. 
 Humiliated. 
 Laughed at. 
 Mocked. 
 But he ended it in our bathtub, his wrists cut open. 
 I found him, but it was too late. 
 His name was Peter Jostun, and he was my little brother, and he matters to me. 
 So I did the same thing they did. 
 I found their secrets, their hidden moments, and I told them I'd make them public. 
 Only I gave them a chance they never gave him. 
 So they could kill themselves before being humiliated. 
 Yes. 
 The easy way out. 
 I can do it myself... 
 I just spoke to Eva. 
 They were able to resuscitate Stefan. He's going to be all right. 
 But I can't hold her very long. 
 No, and she has all his secrets. 
 There's nothing to stop her from doing it again when she gets out. 
 Except me, in all my spare time. 
 Kind of sucks being the boss. 
 Okay, we're ready to go. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 Good luck with the home invasions. 
 I'll need it. 
 It's about Eric. 
 What about Eric? 
 Well... he's about the right age. I mean, we would have still been going out when he was conceived. 
 Are you asking if you're his father? 
 It's not such a crazy notion. 
 Of course you are. 
 What kind of slut do you think I am? 
 No, no, no, no, no, but I mean... why didn't you tell me? 
 Why would I? 
 Do you think I wouldn't want to be part of his life? 
 I wouldn't want you to, Sebastian. 
 You lost everything when we were together... our house, our car, you gambled it all away. 
 It took me almost four years to get out of debt. 
 I don't want that for Eric, and I don't want it for me. 
 But I've changed. 
 Yeah, so I've heard. 
 No. 
 I'd like a chance to show you that I really have changed. 
 I know it will take some time, but I'm willing to take the time. 
 But until then... could I at least call once in a while? 
 Talk to him, and teach him some things? 
 That could be... 
 I think that might be nice. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Just talked to the hospital. Stefan's parents are with him. 
 Good. 
 So, Sebastian... 
 Don't tell me. You gave him the money. 
 Who the hell would believe I had 30,000 Euro? 
 Anyway, you already know who gave him the money. 
 Did Sebastian tell you? 
 He would never give you away. 
 Then how? 
 It's something you would do. 
 Both Eva and Tommy confessed to it. 
 Good. Good, that's what partners do. 
 Family. 
 That too. 
 Here comes my meeting. 
 Do you want me to tell him that I did it? 
 Who would believe you had 30,000 Euro? 
 Yeah, all right, right. 
 I thought you were in Serbia. Welcome home. 
 Thank you, Hickman. 
 It's cold out there. 
 Louis... 
 I restricted Sebastian Berger to these offices until the investigation was concluded, and you released him. 
 Why? 
 I know all I need to know. 
 You know, or you knew? 
 I knew. 
 You knew about the gambling, and you did not tell me? 
 I paid his debt. 
 Sebastian Berger is not corrupt in any way, he's just very bad at picking football winners. 
 It cost a lot in his life. 
 It should have cost his place on this team. 
 He never used ICC equipment to bet, and he has not gambled since coming to me about it. 
 He came to you? 
 He was afraid owing so much could compromise him. 
 He offered to quit. I refused. 
 Are you certain you have all the facts, that it's over? 
 He made a bad mistake. 
 I've made many myself. 
 Luckily, someone always helped me. 
 Whoever sent me those files and sent them to the newspapers, they were intent on making us look corrupt, to embarrass the ICC. 
 I'll issue a statement tomorrow... saying that we have conducted an internal investigated... and found nothing of note, and then if that "anonymous Italian" wants to press, he will find a formidable enemy waiting for him. 
 Thank you, Dorn. 
 Where did you get the money? 
 Oh... our savings. 
 Does Rebecca know? 
 Not yet, tonight. Would you like to come with me? 
 Not on a bet, Louis. Not on a bet!
