 Previously on  Good Witch. 
 I need to know if I'm imagining this thing that seems to be between us. 
 You're not. 
 I'm not pregnant. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I deserve more for what I'm bringing to her business. 
 You stole my investor! 
 Is that Zimbabwe? 
 Victoria Falls. 
 Is that you? 
 Base jumped off the highest peak. 
 Full-time archeologist, part-time adrenaline junkie. 
 Present. 
 So... paragliding in Turkey, cave-diving in Mexico... 
 What haven't you done? 
 Oh, uh, teach at a tiny Midwestern college. 
 Live in a small town. And not use my passport for six months. 
 I just took a job at the university over in Blairsville. 
 What about you, after we parted ways? 
 I did my fair share of traveling. 
 And then you ended up here. 
 Yeah, this place called to me. 
 And you could hear it all the way on the other side of the world? 
 Actually, it was Vietnam. 
 Do you ever wonder what would have happened if you hadn't left me in Istanbul? 
 I didn't leave you alone. 
 You left, but I felt like I abandoned you. 
 Oh no. There was no abandoning by either one of us, just moving in different directions. 
 Well, it wasn't the same without you. That dig, and then after that dig. 
 Yeah, I missed you guys too. 
 All of us? Maybe more one than the other two? 
 Do you still keep in touch with them? Mark and Brook? 
 Yeah, a postcard here and there. I guess we all lost touch over the years. 
 Look, now that I'm here to share what I know with the next generation of archeologists, we have a chance to catch up, right? 
 Do you still believe in fate? 
 I do. Do you? 
 I believe that I'm... really happy that I took this job. 
 Good to see you again, John. 
 You too. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Do you maybe want to borrow a rake? 
 I'm good. I have a system. 
 Yeah. 
 It's a bad system, but it's a system. 
 Hey, how are the driving lessons coming? 
 Well, Mom and Brandon both mean well, they really do, but they are horrible teachers. 
 I don't know. I just want to get enough experience behind the wheel to pass my driving test, but they're both so worried about safety, which, believe me, I get, driving a car is serious, but Brandon wouldn't even hand me the keys until we finished a 20-point safety check which included changing a flat tire and... 
 Grace. 
 Yes? 
 Pun intended, what are you driving at? 
 Will you please teach me how to drive? 
 You want me to teach you? 
 Yes. You might be my last hope. 
 If it's okay with your mother. 
 Wait, really? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes! No, it's perfect with her. 
 Wait, that's Nick. Today. After school. 
 Great. 
 Beep beep. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 Hey. 
 Why are you so happy? 
 Uh... 
 Your dad just agreed to teach me how to drive. 
 And you want him to? 
 Yes, of course. 
 I have a very strong feeling that he is gonna be better than Mom and Brandon. 
 Do you have practice after school? 
 Yeah. 
 But you don't want to go? 
 The truth is I'm only playing because it's making my parents happy. 
 Wait, wait, Nick. 
 Come on, you love to play. 
 Not anymore. 
 And I can't quit. 
 Okay. 
 Smells good. 
 Try one. 
 Since when do you bake? 
 Oh, Sam, please, it's not nuclear fusion. If you can read a recipe, you can bake. 
 Cassie, I hope this is okay. 
 Of course, guests are always welcome to use the kitchen. 
 And I made extra so you can serve it with tea. 
 That's very thoughtful. You really should join us for tea someday. 
 Well, thank you, but my job does not allow for "tea time". 
 Did Grace talk to you? 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Just wanted to make sure you were okay with it. 
 I'm sorry, did I... did I miss something? 
 Sam is gonna teach Grace to drive. 
 Wow. Sam, aren't you a little busy with work and Nick to find time to teach someone else's child to drive? 
 Grace isn't just "someone else's child". 
 She's Grace. And for important things, I always find the time. Thank you, Sam. 
 Happy to help. 
 Best location on the market. 
 Street traffic and foot traffic. 
 The owner is making a number of modifications and upgrades that aren't reflected in the rent. 
 It's a great deal. I think you and I both know quality when we see it. 
 We do. 
 The plumbing checks out. 
 Brand new water heater and all the pipes are newly retro-fitted PVC. Looks good. 
 Great, thanks. 
 I do have someone else who's interested in the property. 
 Might even be willing to pay more. 
 Surely, I don't have to tell the number one realtor in Middleton what a quality tenant looks like, do I? 
 Promise to have lunch with me to celebrate the closing? 
 I promise. 
 Hey. Where's Beth? 
 She's holed up in her room. 
 She won't talk to me. 
 I can understand... 
 If the situation was reversed and she called off the wedding, it'd be me up there not talking. 
 But I'm not a bad guy. 
 I know. You clearly love Beth, which is why you've always done what you thought she wanted you to do. 
 Beth has a really strong personality. 
 I know if I told her what I really felt, we'd fight. 
 Just like my parents. 
 They fought all the time when I was growing up and I hated it. 
 After three years of dating, Beth doesn't know who I am. 
 It's my fault. I've been dishonest, and she doesn't know the man she'd be marrying. 
 Then introduce her to that man. 
 Show Beth your true self. 
 I wouldn't know where to start. 
 I just hope one day she'll understand and forgive me. 
 Thanks for waiting. Dessert is on the house. 
 Oh, you need water. Oh! Thank you. 
 There you go. Be right back with your bill. 
 You know, you really don't have to fix that. 
 I already did. 
 Well, you sir have just earned yourself a free piece of fresh apple pie. 
 I'd rather a kiss. 
 Maybe you can have both. 
 Where's your order? You must be starving by now. 
 No, I just came straight from Abigail's. I ate there. 
 You ate with the woman who stole my investor and quit without notice? 
 No, I didn't do that, I was working a job and I always pack a lunch when I'm working. 
 Hey wait, hey. 
 How about dinner tonight? I'll cook and you can just sit back and relax. 
 That sounds nice. I could use a break, but I can't tonight. 
 Abigail always closed for me and she's not here. - (dishes crashing) 
 Look, just as soon as I have a spare minute, though. Okay? 
 Are you okay? 
 I made your favorite pancakes. 
 Well, Cassie helped. 
 But I asked her to. There were no chocolate chips for the eyes, so I subbed raisins. 
 You shouldn't have come here. 
 I'm trying to be supportive. 
 I'm sorry you're not pregnant, but we have to move on. 
 If I would have been pregnant, would you have been upset? 
 That's a big hypothetical. 
 I'm at Grey House and not at home because even though you won't answer the question, it's clear you don't want to have a baby. 
 And I do. 
 Eve? 
 Look, I just want you to know, I know what it's like to deal with an overbearing ex. 
 Mm-hmm. I think you handled her beautifully. 
 Better than she deserved. If my ex had the nerve to tell the person I liked to back off, well, let's just say you were much more polite than I would have been. 
 Good morning, Mrs. Cranston. 
 Good morning. 
 I'll be right with you. 
 Thank you. 
 FYI, I'm team Cassie all the way. As if there is a team Linda. 
 I mean, Cassie is such a sweet, classy lady. And I'll tell you, if Linda ruined your chances with her... 
 Why don't we get Mrs. Cranston signed in? 
 Of course, Dr. Radford. 
 If you need any help, just let me know. 
 It feels weird to be working again, but really good. Thank you, Cassie. 
 I think you're exactly what the store was looking for. 
 Honestly, after the accident, my hands weren't the same. 
 I've had a lot of doctors tell me the same thing... 
 I need to learn to live with it. 
 And that's why you had to quit at the salon? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, your bracelets are beautiful. 
 Thanks, I made them myself. It's just a hobby. 
 What can I do? Put me to work, please. 
 Well, I need to organize and string these beads to use for decoration. 
 I can do that. 
 Is that okay, with your hands? 
 Why don't I... do what I can, and I'll stop when my fingers give out. 
 Sounds like the beginnings of a good plan. 
 These are the supply invoices that I need you to sign, when you get a chance. 
 You're not talking? 
 Why aren't you talking? 
 You know, I was going to tell you this later, but there's been a change with The Middleton Small Business Association Awards venue from the civic auditorium to the Town Hall. 
 Good news though, you don't need a permit for the Town Hall. 
 I'm sorry, I cannot read your writing. 
 You can email me. 
 Not take everything you thought you knew about what a mop can do and throw it right out the window. 
 Looking to buy a new mop? 
 Uh, I don't know, maybe. 
 I'm guessing that you're not here for the TV. 
 Maybe my new guest? 
 Tara. 
 She's angry with me. 
 She thought she was pregnant, but it turned out to be a false alarm. 
 Yeah. She told me. We had a long talk. 
 Well, the false alarm is turning into a real alarm. 
 She wants to start a family. Now. 
 What do you want to do? 
 If I knew that, I wouldn't be here watching infomercials. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I told you I'd pick up Nick today. 
 Oh, I thought you'd be too busy with Grace. 
 Oh, Dr. Radford. Mrs. Radford. 
 Oh, I go by my maiden name, Wallace. But Linda is fine. 
 I'm so glad I ran into the both of you. I just wanted to say that Nick is a different kid this year, so whatever you're doing at home, it's working. 
 Okay, so what you're saying is we should continue to spend time together as a family? Just the three of us. To help Nick. 
 Uh... if that's what you're doing, then, right, please continue. 
 Please excuse me, duty calls. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, looks like we've received our marching orders. 
 I wanted to apologize for canceling  our wedding at the last minute. 
 Clearly Larry and I... I guess we don't belong together. 
 You don't have to be the perfect couple to be perfect for each other. 
 Beth... 
 No... 
 No more talking. I called the airline, I'm going home. 
 Okay. 
 Goodbye, Cassie. 
 I'm sorry, but you can't leave yet. Neither of you. 
 You have to decide what to do with all the wedding arrangements you had me make. 
 It's all paid for, so you have to figure out where to send it or how to donate it. 
 Normally, I would help take care of things, but I have a new employee and I don't want to leave her alone. 
 Do we really have to do this? 
 Well, if you don't cancel what's been ordered and redirect it, it's all gonna come here. 
 I find the best way to sort things out is to write them down. 
 Trust me. You'll be glad you did. 
 You're not turning the car on. 
 I'm aware. I'm nervous. 
 I see that. Why? 
 Because all of my other driving lessons were disasters, okay? 
 And I'm afraid that I'm going to fail my test. 
 I don't fail tests. I pass them, right? I don't just pass them, I set the curve. 
 You're gonna be great. 
 But in order to be great, you are going to have to turn on the car. 
 (engine starting) 
 We have ignition. 
 Ha! 
 (entrance bell ringing) 
 Stephanie. Hi. 
 Sit. Ugh. 
 My back is killing me. 
 Here. Use this with heat at night and you'll be back into fighting shape in no time. 
 It's my own special blend. It's Frankincense, cypress and white fir. And this is Rosa Damascena. 
 For my back too? 
 Your head. It's good for stress. 
 You know, if your cousin hadn't abandoned me, I wouldn't need oil or heat or... head herbs. 
 I just... I can't get over the fact that Abigail just betrayed me. 
 I mean, she just waltzed in and stole my investor and used him to further her own career. 
 If you keep thinking too much about what's bad, you may end up losing what's good. 
 Okay. I don't wanna talk about Abigail, I want to talk about that tall dark stranger I saw walking you to your car last night. 
 John Dover. 
 He's an archeologist teaching at the University. 
 We knew each other in college. 
 Young love? 
 We were friends. We traveled around with other friends. 
 Well. Even from afar, I could see a spark. 
 Ha! (giggling) 
 That was fantastic. 
 I mean, seriously, you should really be a Driver's Ed teacher on the side. You killed it. 
 I don't think so. 
 Seriously, you did. And I have to be honest, I was a little hesitant at first to go on the freeway, but once I did, I did great. 
 Well, first time. That's understandable. 
 Your decision not to let that big rig pass was... interesting. 
 Wait. He wanted to pass? 
 He did. 
 Oh no, you see, he was waving at me. 
 He wanted you to move over. 
 He sure was polite. Wow. 
 Well, whatever he was, you were a little too close. 
 Well, it didn't feel too close to me. 
 So when are you free tomorrow? 
 This business is a lifelong dream of mine. 
 I want to get started right away. I found the perfect location. 
 I don't want to lose it. I would never ask you to break the rules, but if there's anything that you can do to help me out... 
 You're not saying anything. 
 (whispering): I'm not supposed to talk. 
 Doctor's orders. Usually a business permit takes three months to issue, but... 
 I could expedite the process. 
 I only ask one small favor in return. 
 I need you to promise to spend a day with a "K-buddy". 
 A what? 
 A kindergartner. It's my new mentoring program. 
 So I would have to... 
 Spend one day with a K-buddy and your permit is as good as done. Ahem! 
 You, Madam Mayor, have a deal. 
 I love kids. 
 You should know, today, with Grace and I'm not one for drama we almost died. 
 Sam. 
 She unknowingly played chicken with an eighteen-wheeler. 
 You took her on the freeway? 
 No. I didn't. 
 She took me before I could stop her. 
 I saw my life flash before my eyes, twice. 
 How was Grace? 
 Oh, fine. She thinks the trucker was honking and waving her on. He wasn't. 
 Too late to tell her they've upped the driving age to 18? 
 Sam... 
 I'll take her out again. 
 You're a good sport. 
 But you owe me. 
 Sure. I'll be happy to pay up. How about dinner tomorrow? 
 Suddenly, risking my life seems worthwhile. 
 How did I know I'd find you here? Hi, Cassie. 
 Linda. 
 Listen. I got us all tickets for a college basketball game tomorrow night. 
 That sounds like a perfect mother-son outing. 
 Nick is looking forward to us doing this as a family, Sam. 
 We can do it another night. 
 Your schedule is always so free... 
 How nice for you. For all of us. 
 Okay. 
 Hi, Cassie. 
 Hi. 
 See ya later. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 I just finished the inventory, I deposited last night's cash at the bank, and I ordered more shopping bags from your supplier. 
 Great. 
 What else can I do? 
 Oh, there's always so much to do at the Bell, Book and Candle. 
 I'm sure you'll find something. 
 Hello there. 
 John. 
 My chef made a mistake on your order, so we're gonna have to redo it. There'll just be a slight delay. 
 This is fortuitous. 
 Yeah. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Excuse me. 
 Can I get my salad? 
 The kitchen is running slow today. 
 Oh, is it? 
 Everything okay? 
 Anna. My girlfriend. She's overseas. 
 Oh, long distance relationship. 
 For now. 
 When is she coming here? 
 I don't think small town living is for her. 
 You never know until you try. Or ask. 
 She's not happy unless she's on a dig, with a war breaking out all around her. 
 And you? 
 Me? 
 Yeah, I'm starting to see the beauty of small town living. 
 Here you go. On the house. 
 Welcome to Middleton. 
 Thank you. 
 Any friend of Cassie's is a friend of mine. 
 Good to know. Ladies. 
 Oh, come on. The girlfriend that is conveniently out of town and has no plans to ever come and see him? 
 Face it, this "fake girlfriend" is just a way for him to save face in case you are not interested in him... 
 Unless of course you are interested. 
 And then he says, all dramatic but sweet, "I don't know what I would have done without her." 
 He's talking about Cassie, of course. And then she says: "How am I supposed to compete with that?" I don't know how she ever would. 
 Have you met his ex-wife? 
 Dr. Radford. Uh... 
 Keep up the good fight. (chuckling) 
 Was Martin just talking about the private conversation I had with my ex-wife? 
 Please don't yell. 
 I'm not. 
 You are. 
 Eve, my private life is just that. It's private. 
 No one likes a doctor who seems distracted. 
 I was just trying to help. 
 I'm not distracted. 
 I think Martin would disagree. 
 Well, Martin... Stop. 
 Please. 
 Stop talking about everybody and everything. 
 This is a doctor's office, it's not a talk show. 
 Ta-da! 
 It's beautiful. 
 I saw it was damaged and I thought I would do something for you, for all you've done for me. 
 You did a wonderful job. 
 Ah, I was the only girl who opted for shop in my high school class. 
 You do have an eclectic skill set. 
 That is a nice way of saying I have a lot of different unrelated skills. 
 You never know how things are related until all the pieces come together. 
 Okay. Maybe we take a rest from parallel parking. 
 No, no. We can't. 
 This is the one thing that I have not mastered yet. 
 Okay... then let's do it. 
 Really? 
 What are we doing? 
 We're looking at this from a different angle. 
 Parking like this is all about angles. 
 Angles? 
 Like geometry. 
 Ooh, I aced geometry. 
 Then you should ace parallel parking. 
 Yes. 
 Don't think of this as a car, think of this as the middle box that you've got to get between two other boxes. Picture the angle, think about where you want the car to go, where you want to go. 
 And the steering wheel is your pencil. 
 Huh! I think I get it. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. I feel good about this one. 
 Geometry. 
 The steering wheel is my pencil. 
 I feel good about this one. 
 Okay! Not there, but close. 
 Yeah. 
 Alright, it's time to hit the highway? 
 Sure. 
 (giggling) 
 Next time we'll get away for a proper meal. 
 Deal. Abigail wanted me to resurface all her countertops, but I told her I had a better offer. 
 Ben, that's a paying job. 
 You're way more important to me than a job. 
 Are you always so thoughtful? 
 Can I get a triple macchiato with skim milk and extra foam? Thanks. 
 Hey. 
 I've been trying to call you to set up our lunch date. 
 That's so funny, I didn't see any missed calls. 
 You know what? I'll call you later. 
 Great. 
 I can't believe I ever trusted that woman. 
 You're letting this thing with Abigail consume you. 
 I am not. 
 You are. 
 You care way too much about all the bad things in your life... and if you're not careful, ou may lose what's really good in your life. 
 Cassie... 
 Okay, well, we both love halibut, so let's split that. 
 Thirty pounds of halibut? 
 You can freeze it. 
 Fine with me. 
 Good, and I think that we should donate the flowers to the Middleton hospital. 
 Fine by me. 
 Great. 
 Wait, no, not fine by me. The flowers are fine, but the truth is I hate fish. 
 Since when? 
 Grade school. 
 So you lied about liking fish? 
 I didn't mean to lie. 
 Okay, so what else have you lied about? 
 You don't want to know. 
 I'm asking. I want to know. 
 Fine. I hate our new couch. 
 Is that all? 
 I'm allergic to your cat. 
 I hate to hike. The list goes on and on and on. 
 Okay, so you've just been going along with everything I wanted? 
 Yes. Mostly. 
 But how is that possible? 
 You saw what I wanted you to see. 
 Which was what? 
 The man that I thought you wanted. 
 That's not really me. 
 What are you doing? 
 I was waiting. I didn't want to intrude. 
 It seemed pretty intense in there. 
 They've been fighting all night with that list you gave them. 
 I can't believe they were gonna get married. 
 They're not fighting. 
 Oh, no? What do you call what they're doing? 
 Communicating. Maybe for the first time. 
 Every couple needs to do that, don't you think? 
 Thanks, Mom. 
 You know, we can go again. 
 It would be fun. 
 It would be fun. 
 'Night, guys. 
 Goodnight, sweetheart. 
 'Night. 
 'Night. 
 Goodnight, Linda. 
 I'm sorry that you missed your dinner with Cassie. There'll be other dinners. 
 I don't know, with her ex-boyfriend in town, maybe not. 
 Oh, she didn't tell you? 
 Anyway, good night. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Just want to earn my keep. 
 You know, you can't stay at Grey House forever. 
 Come home. 
 I'm not ready. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 There is a gigantic "but" in that statement. 
 This isn't just a whim or a phase or something I'm gonna get past. 
 I want to be a mother. 
 I feel it in my bones this is something I should be doing right now. 
 What about school? 
 I can work around it. 
 We don't have any money saved. 
 No, we don't. And our place is too small. 
 If we put our minds together, we could come up with a million reasons why having a baby isn't the right time right now. 
 But can I ask you something? 
 Sure. 
 When is the right time? 
 When will everything be so perfect that it'll be right? 
 It's never the right time. It's just... time. 
 And I know you're gonna be an amazing dad. And I know it'll be scary, but we'll be doing it together. 
 I want to have kids. 
 But when I told you the other day that I was relieved that you weren't pregnant, that it was a false alarm... I was just being honest. 
 And I want to keep being honest with you. 
 I'm not ready. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, your voice just isn't healing as well as I'd hoped. 
 Did you really not speak for 72 hours? Martha. 
 You can't give your speech. 
 If you use your normal voice, let alone a public speaking voice, you could cause permanent damage to your voice box. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Martha, what's wrong? 
 Oh, she can't speak. 
 And now she can't give her acceptance speech. 
 Well, sometimes being there means more than words can express. 
 For you. 
 Is this my tea that tastes like coffee? 
 It is. 
 Thank you. But what did I do to deserve the free delivery service? 
 You are teaching Grace how to drive. I think I owe you more than some hot tea. 
 So, I hear there's a new guy in town. 
 Oh yeah, John Dover. 
 We traveled around together after college with some friends. 
 Well, it's good to catch up with old friends. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Radford. 
 Oh! Thank you. I've got patients. 
 Sure. 
 Hello. 
 I have to get something off my chest. 
 I was hurt and upset that you stole my investor and quit, leaving me in a total lurch. 
 But I've done a lot of soul searching recently and... 
 I forgive you. 
 Oh. 
 I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it for me. 
 You're gonna have to live with what you did and how you treated me, but as of right now, at this moment, it's over. 
 Hi, Chuck. 
 So Stephanie, you dodged a bullet, huh? 
 The building you were gonna rent? They had a small electrical fire. And after the fire, they discovered all sorts of code violations. 
 The building got condemned. 
 Wow. 
 More than "wow". 
 If you'd signed the lease, you would have been on the hook for all the repairs. 
 You're welcome. 
 (half whispering): I have a bone to pick with you. 
 Did I do something? 
 No. You've done nothing. 
 You made a promise to me and my little K-buddy. 
 Now pay up or our deal is off. 
 You have one day. 
 And I want my lunch. 
 We just wanted you to know that we finished canceling all our plans. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, for being so understanding. 
 A letter for you. I needed to sort some things out. 
 It helped to write them down. 
 I'm glad I did. It usually does. 
 What? 
 I was up all night sorting through this whole mess and I couldn't sleep, so... 
 I wrote you a letter too. 
 Sometimes, when we can't find the right words to say, we can find the right words to write. 
 I started writing about the wedding, but ended up writing about Beth. 
 I should have more confidence to be myself with you. 
 I should have been more honest. 
 I know you wrote this for me, but maybe you want to read it to Larry? 
 Larry, I'm so sorry. 
 What do you have to apologize for? 
 That you felt you couldn't be honest with me about your wants and your needs. 
 I'm so sad you didn't trust me to like you for you. 
 I just wish this had all come out sooner. 
 I kinda feel like we ruined something really great. 
 What if we... started over? 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you, Cassie. So much. 
 Peace offering. Oatmeal and chocolate chip. 
 They're some kind of hybrid. There's also sugar cookies in case you're allergic to either oatmeal or chocolate. 
 I'm really sorry, Dr. Radford. 
 I know it was wrong to share your personal life with patients. 
 I grew up in Middleton and everyone pretty much knows everything about everyone else. 
 That's the wonderful thing about growing up here. 
 People know what's going on in your life because they care about you. Look, I can help you find a replacement. 
 Someone more professional, a little less chatty. 
 Okay. 
 Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are my favorite. 
 Sit down. 
 I heard that you're having problems with your dog? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, you know the secret to training any dog, don't you? 
 The treats. 
 This jewelry is perfect. It's like it was made for this case. 
 I'm glad you think so. 
 But these necklaces and bracelets and earrings, I know my inventory, and these didn't come from here. 
 I made it. I used to bead all the time, but I got so busy at the hair salon... 
 I forgot how much I love doing it. 
 So, you overcame the limits you had put on yourself. 
 I guess I did. 
 Well, I would love to keep you working here with me, but I think you found your passion again. 
 You helped me. 
 You helped yourself. 
 Thank you, Cassie. 
 Hey, neighbor. 
 Hey. 
 Linda told me about your ex-boyfriend moving to town. 
 And to be honest, it kinda threw me. 
 Not because he's your ex, but... I just wish you had told me. 
 John Dover is not my ex-boyfriend. He's a friend. 
 But you didn't mention him. 
 I didn't think it mattered that an old friend is teaching at the university in Blairsville. 
 Linda. 
 I should have known. 
 Forget it. 
 It's okay. 
 No. It's not okay. It's Linda, she's constantly winding me up. 
 I don't condone her actions, but I do feel sorry for her. 
 You are like a good-looking Dalai Lama. 
 (laughing) 
 The Dalai Lama is a spiritual advisor to millions. 
 I'm just being kind to your ex-wife. 
 But you are pretty good-looking. 
 (laughing) 
 Thank you. 
 Can we try dinner again? 
 Absolutely. 
 Great. 
 I love the freeway. 
 Okay. 
 I care about you too much to let you keep driving on the freeway without saying this. 
 Okay. This little square is us. 
 Aw. 
 And this big rectangle is that truck. 
 Oh. 
 Here's where the big rectangle squashes the little square. 
 Ouch. 
 And the little square didn't check blind spots... 
 ...before the little square changed lanes. 
 Because the little square didn't have the right of way. 
 So that trucker wasn't waving me through? 
 He wasn't. 
 I guess I better work more on my freeway driving. 
 Yeah, you should. But hey, we'll get you there. 
 All of this will end up with you getting your driver's license. 
 Thanks, Sam. 
 And this is the flower fridge. 
 So, what do we do next? 
 Um, do you know how to cut flowers? 
 I'm not allowed to have scissors. 
 Let's see what Auntie Abigail can do about that. 
 I'm not allowed to have ice cream either. 
 Well, it's all part of the K-buddy program. 
 Cool. 
 Why flowers? 
 Back in New York, I lived off of 28th, right near the Flower Market, and every day I would walk past the most beautiful flowers. 
 So you love flowers? 
 I also love that the only other flower shop in town just went out of business, leaving me with tons of customers and no competition. 
 Enjoying your lunch? 
 Thanks. 
 Who's that? 
 That's my new Abigail. It's a trial run. 
 I'm sorry I got so crazy. 
 I was worried about you. 
 You were... and you weren't afraid to tell me what I was doing wrong. 
 I haven't had that in someone I dated. 
 Thanks. 
 I worked things out with Abigail. 
 Good. (laughter) 
 I am proud to be here to present this year's community leader award to our very own Mayor, Martha Tinsdale. 
 Well, uh, the Mayor has a speech... 
 Just a moment. 
 Instead of her planned speech, the Mayor would like you all to know what her good friend Cassie recently reminded her: that having you all here to support her means more than any words can express. 
 So, Mayor Martha Tinsdale. 
 John. 
 Uh, I brought wine. 
 Your favorite. 
 Can I come in? We have a lot to talk about.
