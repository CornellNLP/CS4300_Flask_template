 Previously on  Good Witch... 
 Wish we could switch parents. 
 Your mom would understand why I want to go to London. 
 Hillcrest Hospital might offer me their Chief of Staff job. 
 I'm totally committed to us having kids, there's just a lot of change coming our way. 
 I'm glad we reconnected. 
 (Ding!) 
 Ah, this place is amazing. 
 Yeah, for such a small town. 
 Middleton offers a lot of unexpected things. 
 True. 
 Feels good to stretch my legs. 
 Yeah, but we've been poring over resumes for an hour. I did not think it would be this hard to find a field supervisor. 
 The perfect person is out there. I have a feeling. 
 With your help, I'm sure I'll find them. 
 Nice work. 
 So tell me, how can I pay you back for all this work? 
 Buying me dinner is enough. 
 You're letting me off cheap. 
 Come on, I wanna do something really special for you. 
 To be honest, this is as much fun as it is work. 
 That's how I see it. I wish my students would have a quarter of your enthusiasm, and focus, and patience. 
 It seems like no one wants to wait for anything anymore. 
 And archeology is about delayed gratification. 
 Yeah, trusting your instincts. 
 Continuing ahead even when all the evidence is against you. 
 Faith. 
 In the face of doubt. 
 You have that. 
 So do you. 
 We both have a willingness to wait for something good. 
 Even if you can't see it, you can feel it. 
 Like minds. 
 (theme music) 
 (knocking): Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Did you get today's paper? 
 I did. It's on the counter. 
 Ugh, I swear, that paper boy hates me. 
 I just wanted to look at the forecast. 
 Isn't it on your phone? 
 I don't like what my phone says. 
 My friend Doug is coming to town next Saturday and he thinks we can play golf. 
 Oh. It's freezing! 
 As long as there's not snow on the course, he'll play. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, he's pretty hardcore when it comes to sports. But it doesn't look good. 
 But forecasters are usually wrong, aren't they? 
 The weather can change instantaneously. It's mercurial. 
 Which means they are wrong more than they're right. 
 That's one way to look at it. 
 (sniggering): It's the truth. 
 Your truth. 
 (text alert) 
 Sorry. Ugh, Hillcrest Hospital. 
 The Chief of Staff job. 
 Yeah, they want to send a representative to talk to me. You know, it's a great opportunity that a few years ago I probably would have jumped at. 
 But things have changed. 
 Yeah, well, Like the weather. I've changed. 
 Between my practice and Nick, I'm already short on time. 
 I told them I'm not interested, but they're not giving up. 
 They know a good thing when they see it. 
 I know I can't do a job like that unless I give my life over to it, completely. 
 Balance is important. 
 Nick's important. 
 Oh... I'm sorry. 
 No, I got it. 
 Oh! That's pretty. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 When I was little, before I lost my parents, we used to spend our summers at a cottage on the lake. Some of the best family memories I have. 
 Hmm! 
 My friend told me Middleton is a sleepy town. 
 Peaceful, yes, but vibrant too. 
 Depends on what you're looking for. 
 Peaceful. 
 Cassie Nightingale. Welcome. 
 Can I take your bag up to your room? 
 No! I'm good. 
 Once you get settled in, I can go over all the activities that are going on in Middleton this week. 
 Something tells me you are not here for the sights. 
 Just looking for some rest. I had a minor procedure recently. 
 Nothing too serious, I just thought I'd take some time before going back to work. 
 I tried staying at home, but I kept getting called in. 
 There's no rest in the tech field. 
 Something is always crashing or not working. 
 Your room is down the hall, last door on the left. 
 I'll show you. 
 Nope, I've got it. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, I wish all our guests were like that. 
 Quiet? 
 Easy. 
 Yes... easy. 
 This is nice. 
 Yeah! 
 Although, I feel the store isn't holding as much appeal as your phone. 
 (laughing) 
 Guilty! Sorry. 
 (laughing) 
 There's drama at school. 
 Brenda just sent out invites to her sweet 16 party and everyone is talking about who is and isn't invited. 
 Hmm... 
 I was. 
 That sounds fun. 
 Yeah! 
 No. 
 Those big parties kind of make me uncomfortable. 
 Oh, well, how about something smaller? Movie night at Grey House? 
 You could invite a few girlfriends. 
 Yeah, or we could just hang out. Maybe we could make a batch of the snickerdoodle cookies. 
 Sure, if that's what you want. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Okay. 
 Cassie! 
 Tom! 
 And Grace. 
 Hi, Mr. Tinsdale. 
 You are growing up so fast. 
 You'll be off to college before you know it! 
 Tom, I have something for you. Hmm... 
 For your sinuses. 
 How did you... 
 Oh! Thanks. How much do I owe you? 
 Ten dollars. 
 Here. 
 Thanks. Don't forget your receipt. 
 Is there anything else? 
 Ugh... 
 I do need a present for Martha. 
 Your 30th anniversary. 
 Yes. 
 Oh! Do you have something special planned? 
 Should I? 
 Well, it'd be nice for the both of you. 
 It's more about Martha. 
 She is very big on our anniversary. 
 Hmm! Maybe you were thinking about something festive? 
 Festive... You mean like a party? 
 Oh! It's a great idea. 
 I had a party for Martha when we were first married. 
 She worried so much about everything, she couldn't enjoy it. 
 Well, what she doesn't know... 
 A surprise? 
 That's another great idea! 
 But I can't keep a secret that big from Martha. 
 Hmm... 
 No. 
 No, I can't ask you to do it. 
 Consider it a gift to both of you. 
 Cassie Nightingale, you are an angel. 
 Thank you. 
 I can't find the spoons. 
 Ice cream for lunch? 
 It's a healthy snack full of calcium and... I just want a spoon. 
 I re-arranged everything. 
 This is the third time this week. 
 I'm not even going to mention what you did to my sock drawer. 
 Look, I can tell you're bored. 
 I am. 
 Maybe you should think about going back to school sooner. 
 I'll think about that, but in the meantime... 
 You should find something to do. 
 Like a hobby? 
 Yeah. 
 I saw this today. 
 Community art classes. 
 For adults. Beginners. 
 Great! I think you should do it! It'll be good for you. 
 And for the kitchen. And for me. 
 And for my socks. 
 You want me to cater an anniversary party for Martha? 
 It wouldn't work without you. 
 How many people? Pass hors d'oeuvres or multiple courses? 
 You know what, I'll just work up a tasting menu and Martha can decide. I'll just give her a call. 
 No, ugh... Tom wants it to be a surprise. 
 Oh! No problem. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 I can keep a secret. 
 I can! 
 Hey, Ben. 
 Hey! I fixed the brackets for your shelf. 
 Oh! 
 This is a nice surprise. 
 So, what's up? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 Cassie is planning a surprise anniversary party for Martha and I'm going to cater it. 
 Oh. 
 What? It's not a surprise from Ben. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 The deadline for the application is coming up. 
 I'm still checking out the program. 
 Greg said a semester abroad in London would be a great life experience. 
 Nick, it's not a 2 week vacation. 
 It's 4 months in a foreign country. 
 They all speak English. 
 You're doing well in school. 
 Right! I've totally earned this. 
 What if you fall behind? 
 I won't. 
 Greg said that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
 While I respect Greg's opinion, your life has just begun. You're gonna have lots of chances to do things like this. Most colleges have study abroad programs for juniors and seniors. 
 Why won't you let me go? 
 I need you to explain to me why you want to go. 
 I have. 
 Not really. Not in any detail. 
 Maybe I could read your essay. 
 The study abroad requires that you write a 1,000 word essay on why you want to take part in the London program. 
 I think reading that might help me make my decision. 
 I love your new hair. 
 Thank you! I needed a change. 
 But you don't really want to talk about my hair, do you? 
 Martha's party. 
 Stephanie. When it comes to gossip, that woman has more leaks than the Titanic. If you really want to keep it a surprise, cut her loose now. 
 So, what do you say? 
 Martha is so high-maintenance. 
 Yeah, but this is a surprise party, so Martha won't be involved in the planning. 
 I'm really busy at the store. 
 You really need my help, don't you? 
 If you help Martha, you'll actually be helping yourself. 
 I don't fall for reverse psychology. 
 I know. It's your choice. 
 Okay, fine. 
 You won't regret it. 
 Look, it's Alexis' brother... 
 Greg? 
 Mmm-hmm! 
 You haven't met him yet, have you? 
 No! 
 Perfect. Greg! 
 Hi! I don't believe you've met my cousin, Cassie Nightingale. 
 Ah! It's nice to finally meet you. Alexis is a big fan. 
 Thank you. Send her my love. 
 Alright. I better get back to work. 
 Don't be a stranger! 
 Okay, that is a first. 
 What? 
 I've never had a man play hard to get before. 
 How do you deal with it? 
 Ah! 
 Abigail... 
 I'm just asking. 
 He was just in a hurry! 
 Looks like you might just actually have to work for this one. 
 That'll be a change. 
 (laughing) 
 Something different. 
 Could be fun! 
 Maybe just what you're looking for. 
 Or who I'm looking for. 
 Aren't you cold? 
 It helps me think. 
 About? 
 Everything. 
 You care to elaborate? 
 (laughing) 
 You know, when we were horseback riding, it reminded me how much I love the outdoors. 
 You did seem at home in that saddle. 
 Living in New York and working so much, I didn't get to do things like that. 
 And I didn't really miss it until I got out there again. 
 Our connection to nature is very primal. It's in our DNA. 
 Oddly, that makes sense. 
 (laughing) 
 You know, the lake house? 
 Yeah. 
 The ad we saw in the paper. 
 Maybe if I got a place like that, it'd be a way for Nick and me to get outside, you know. Do things together. Here. Like I did when I was his age. 
 Sounds like you had an epiphany. 
 Yeah. I might have. 
 You know... You know a lot about the area. 
 Yeah. 
 Could you go with me? 
 Sure. 
 Great! I'll set something up for Sunday morning. 
 I'll call the agent and get a key. 
 Great! 
 Yeah! It could be. 
 Oh! I do have to be back early, though. I've got a lot of party planning to do. 
 Ah! Martha's surprise anniversary party? 
 Yeah, I hadn't told you about that yet. 
 Oh, the guy at the food market. 
 He told Eve. And Stephanie told him. 
 So, are you coming? 
 Are you hosting? 
 I am. 
 At Grey House? 
 No! 
 Where then? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Well, at least that part's still a surprise. 
 Mmm-hmm! 
 See you! 
 I am totally stressing about the menu for... 
 (whispering): ...Martha's party. 
 What? 
 Abigail's doing the flowers. 
 Was I not supposed to tell Abigail? 
 It's supposed to be a secret. 
 Yeah, from Martha. 
 No. You're not supposed to tell anyone. 
 Ben probably would have told her anyway. 
 Oh! 
 You look like a woman on a mission. 
 I need answers. 
 My anniversary is coming up. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. You have an anniversary? 
 Yes. All married people do. 
 Have you seen Tom lately? 
 It is a small town, and in a small town you are bound to run into people you know all the time. 
 So, Tom hasn't mentioned our anniversary... that means either A, he's forgotten, or B, he's planning something behind my back. 
 You could just ask him. 
 In our marriage, the duty of marking our anniversary has always been his responsibility. 
 But it's both your anniversaries. 
 Yes, but the responsibility for romance lies with the man. 
 I think keeping the romance alive is a shared responsibility. 
 Well, we'll just have to agree to disagree. 
 Just promise me that if either of you hear anything from Tom, you'll let me know. 
 See... I got this. 
 So, are you going to Brenda's party? 
 Ugh, I don't think so. 
 How's London going? 
 I have to write an essay about why I want to go. 
 That doesn't sound too bad. 
 It's homework. 
 Why do you want to go? 
 I told you, because London is cool and parent-free. 
 You know, it rains almost half the year there. 
 Yeah, I can deal with rain. 
 180 days of rain? 
 You'll be stuck inside a lot and you won't know anyone. 
 But I'll be on my own. 
 That's kind of my point. 
 Are you jealous that I'm going? 
 I'm not. 
 I just want to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. 
 I do. And I'll be fine. 
 So wait, you got in trouble for what at your art class? 
 For mixing our oils with the water colours. 
 "Our" oils? 
 Donna. She's so much fun. We share a station. 
 Oh, nice! 
 Yeah. Her and her husband Chad own their own candy business. 
 Ugh! 
 I can't remember if it's saltwater taffy or peanut brittle that got them started, but they have a whole store now. 
 They are very well off. 
 I think you'd really like Donna. And Chad sounds nice. 
 You haven't met him. 
 Which is why I wanted to invite both of them over, to get to know them better. 
 We need to expand our circle of friends. 
 Why? We have a very full circle. 
 We don't. All our friends here are your friends or your family. 
 Well, maybe we can meet them for dinner. 
 I want to have them here. Entertain in our home. 
 Or I could go back to rearranging the kitchen. 
 Dinner sounds great. 
 Uh-huh! 
 The representative from Hillcrest hospital is here to see you. 
 What? 
 The representative from Hillcrest. 
 I told them I wasn't interested. 
 Well, what do you want me to tell them? 
 Just send him back. 
 What? 
 It's not a "him". It's a "her". 
 Well, send her back. 
 Okay! 
 I'll be out front if you need anything. 
 Thank you, Eve. 
 I'm Valerie Hanson, from Hillcrest. 
 Hi. I'm... 
 Dr. Samuel William Radford. 
 Near perfect MCAT score, top five of your graduating class, chief resident during your training, lead fellow, board certified trauma surgeon and head of one of the busiest ERs in New York City for almost a decade. 
 Hmm! And I told your boss I'm not interested. 
 He's better at taking "no" for an answer than I am, which is why he does what he does, and I do what I do. 
 What do you do? 
 I'm a closer. 
 (laughing) 
 Look. I'm flattered, but I'm happy here. 
 Give me a chance to change your mind. 
 I can spare 15 minutes. 
 I only need 5. 
 
 
 
 Hey, you wanna see a movie tonight? 
 Sure! So, I was thinking... 
 That I don't get to pick the movie? 
 Yeah. I am definitely tired of superheroes taking more than three hours to save the world... no matter how cute they happen to be. 
 I see subtitles in my future. 
 (laughing) 
 What I was thinking is that I can't ask Martha what kind of cake she would like, but you can. 
 You could casually drop cake into a conversation. 
 How do you casually drop cake into a conversation? 
 What? Like, Hey Martha, you need to winterize your pipes. 
 That makes me wonder what kind of cake you like. 
 (laughing): Okay. Point taken. 
 Are you sure you want to do this? 
 Yes. I love catering big parties. 
 Why? 
 Because you get to be a part of everyone's best moments. 
 Weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, engagements... 
 All the good and happy things in people's lives. 
 That's why I want Martha's party to be perfect. 
 You make it sound romantic. 
 To me it is. 
 I really think you should reconsider opening a catering business. 
 I lost my investor. 
 I remember that. 
 But he isn't the only person that can invest. 
 He's the only person I know. 
 I could find you an investor. 
 How? 
 I have a lot of friends you don't know about. 
 That's sweet, but let's just forget about it, okay? 
 Fancy! 
 Perfect for Madam Mayor. 
 Tom wants the location to be very special. 
 I don't see why you just don't have it here. 
 Tom wants it to be someplace Martha's never been, so they can go back and enjoy the memories. 
 Sounds like a lot of work. 
 He loves her. 
 That also sounds like a lot of work. 
 (bang) 
 Dan... what is it? 
 I... I was reading. I must have fallen asleep. 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 No. 
 You look like you've seen a ghost. 
 I think I did. 
 I was sound asleep until I heard this bang. 
 I sat up in bed and that's when I saw her. 
 The ghost? 
 A shadowy figure in the corner of the room. 
 What did she look like? 
 She was young, pretty, but she looked sad. She didn't say anything, but she was looking right at me. 
 I turned on the light and she was gone. 
 Is everything alright in here? 
 Dan, this is my son, Brandon. 
 Look, I know what I sound like and if I were you, I wouldn't believe me either, but I did see a ghost. 
 She was as real as the three of you. I swear. 
 A ghost? 
 Have you ever had any reports of apparitions in the past? 
 Last I checked, Grey House was apparition-free. 
 Yeah. Because, no offense, but ghosts aren't real. 
 When we see something out of the ordinary it's a sign we need to pay attention. 
 Don't worry. We we'll get to the bottom of this. I promise. 
 I think we should switch your room. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll have George bring up a key. 
 You're not buying this ghost stuff, are you? 
 The guy is off his rocker. 
 I mean, if you said you saw something, that's one thing. But you are you. 
 Just because we can't see something doesn't mean it isn't there. 
 Okay. But you should keep an eye on that guy. 
 I get a funny feeling. 
 Done. And agreed. 
 Now, as much as I'd love to stand around chatting about nonexistent ghosts, Tara sent me here for- 
 For my chicken vindaloo? 
 She's planning a dinner party. 
 She's keeping busy. 
 Looks like you two are planning something as well. 
 Yeah! Tom enlisted me to plan a surprise anniversary party for Martha. We were thinking about the restaurant overlooking the golf course. 
 Jack's. 
 Impossible. Not the restaurant. 
 But keeping a secret from Martha? She'll smell it a mile away. 
 Well, then we'll just all have to go the extra mile. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Hey! 
 What's this? 
 Lunch. 
 Well, thank you! 
 Do you want to share? 
 Oh! I thought you'd never ask. 
 There is... two of everything in here. 
 What? Is there? That's weird! 
 Okay. Let's see. 
 Lahmacun? 
 With beetroot. 
 And homemade! 
 There's a vegan restaurant by the college run by this family from Turkey. Very authentic. 
 Reminds me of... 
 Istanbul. 
 Uh-huh! 
 So, I thought of you the other day. 
 I was rock climbing. 
 Oh. Cedar Bluff? 
 Rocky Hollow. 
 It's beautiful up there. 
 Yeah. When's the last time you went? 
 Ages. To be honest, no one in my immediate circle likes to hike. 
 Hiking is meant for patient souls not needing a quick fix. 
 I was in Scotland before this. 
 The Isle of Skye... life changing. 
 Yeah. There is nothing like standing alone surrounded by nature. 
 It helps you understand your place in the universe. 
 It helps you understand the world! 
 Most people like to know where they're going. But me, I like not knowing my destination until I get there. 
 You used to love that too. 
 I still do. 
 Then come with me sometime. 
 Hiking? 
 Yeah! I found a place at the park, near some waterfalls, peaceful, beautiful... 
 Alter Falls? 
 No. 
 I know this area pretty well. 
 Well, I think there are things around here that you haven't seen, even though you think you have. 
 Maybe Middleton can still surprise you too. 
 I still can't believe you got me here. 
 Persistence. 
 I said no to lunch. 
 This isn't lunch. I just wanted you to see your new office. 
 Not my office. 
 I know you are the right man for the job. And I always get my man... professionally speaking. 
 Well, the job is very intriguing. 
 And the office is nice too. 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 But I have my practice to think of and being the only doctor in Middleton, I have to think of the town too. 
 I can't abandon it, or them. 
 Understandable. But maybe we can find a way to work around that. 
 I also have a son who's going to college soon. 
 I have a son too! 
 But he's 12, not quite ready to leave the nest. I have to ask, are the teen years as bad as they say they are? 
 (laughing) 
 There are ups and downs. But Nick's doing great right now and I want to spend as much time with him as possible. 
 But if your son's going to college soon, you might want to secure something that will allow you to ramp up your career in the future. 
 The next step would be to meet some of my colleagues. 
 Would you like to take the next step? 
 Hmm... 
 I have a feeling that Martha would like hydrangeas and baby roses. 
 I saw her wedding photo, and she had that bouquet. 
 What are you up to? 
 You do seem preoccupied. 
 I'm just sitting here. 
 Looking for someone? 
 No one in particular. 
 Oh look! There's Greg. 
 It would be rude to not say hello. 
 And you are never rude. 
 Hey there! 
 Hello. 
 We seem to keep running into each other. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 Maybe we should make a plan to run into each other? 
 I like that idea. 
 How about lunch? 
 I love lunch. 
 Me too. 
 We just met and we have so much in common already. 
 I almost feel sorry for him. 
 I think he's exactly what Abigail needs. 
 Yeah, how about 12:30? 
 Hey! Working on your essay? 
 Ugh... Yeah. 
 I can't wait to read it. 
 Hey, I am... going to look at a lake house tomorrow. 
 For what? 
 For... us! 
 You want to buy a lake house? 
 Yeah, I thought it would be fun to have a vacation place for the weekends. 
 To do what? 
 Well, I don't know! 
 Fish, jet ski, hang out on a boat. 
 I guess that'd be kind of cool. 
 Especially if you get it before I go to London. 
 I brought you some tea. 
 My favourite! 
 Thanks, mom. 
 Sure. There you go. 
 So, how are things going? 
 Oh great. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, actually I forgot to tell you. I aced my lab in Honours Biology. 
 Great! Nice. And what about Sam's office? 
 I love it there. 
 Eve is so nice and Sam, he's a really good doctor. 
 It's not too much with school? 
 No, no! 
 And don't worry! I am totally on track to getting straight A's again. 
 Well, grades are important, but there are other aspects to school, like hanging out with friends. 
 I know. 
 I just haven't really been up to doing that lately. 
 Is there a problem? 
 Some of the girls at school? 
 No. Really. Everyone is fine. 
 Well, I can tell that there is something... 
 Well, I mean, Nick might go to London. 
 And Lori is away on assignment in L.A. 
 Brandon and Tara are totally into that baby thing. 
 Eve said Sam might take the job at the hospital... and I mean Abigail... if it's not her job, it's another guy, so... 
 I'm here. 
 No, I know. 
 But you have Bell, Book and Candle, and all of the guests... 
 Do you feel like you and I don't spend enough time together? 
 It's just We aren't all together like we used to be. 
 Everyone is kind of doing their own thing. 
 We could make cookies. 
 And watch a movie. Just us. 
 I'd love to. 
 But biology calls. 
 Right. Okay. 
 Love you. 
 I love you. 
 And if you change your mind, I'm here. 
 I know that. Thanks. 
 So, I met with the hospital administrator for Hillcrest. 
 Oh! How was it? 
 She's intense. 
 And she was in full sell mode. 
 She came by the office unannounced, and before I knew it, I had agreed to meet her at the hospital the next day. 
 They know you'd do an amazing job. 
 It is a great opportunity, I just don't know how I could do that job and spend any time with Nick, let alone keep my practice. 
 Keeping a balance is a challenge. 
 Yeah. It is. 
 Why are you stopping? 
 That's the third time I passed those signs. 
 I just made a huge circle again. 
 You did? 
 I don't think these directions are right. 
 There's no Forestview Drive. 
 Eve's use of the Map app is questionable. 
 What about your phone? (laughing) 
 No signal. 
 We are off the grid. In a way. 
 Well, maybe that's the sign to turn back. 
 No. You're definitely going the right way. 
 Here. 
 May I see that? 
 It's about a mile ahead, that way. 
 So you take a left and then the first right. 
 You got that from this? 
 I did! 
 That's definitely a sign we should keep going. 
 Ahem! 
 Okay, Mr. Quiet. What is up with you? 
 Nothing. 
 Have you started your London essay? 
 If by starting you mean opening up my laptop, then... yeah. 
 Well, don't worry. 
 It's always hard to begin a paper. 
 I don't see why I need to write a huge essay anyway. 
 They probably just want to make sure that you've done your research on London and the program. 
 Did you know that London is 6 hours ahead? 
 Yes! 
 It might make it hard to Skype with people back home. 
 And it's an 8 hour school day over there. 
 Challenging. 
 Seriously, who does school for 8 hours? 
 You! 
 If you go. 
 You do still want to go, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Absolutely. 
 Hmm! 
 ♪ I think the universe is on my side  ♪ 
 ♪  Heaven and Earth have finally aligned  ♪ 
 ♪  Days are good  ♪ 
 ♪  And that's the way it should be ♪ 
 I'm glad we stayed with it. 
 It is stunning! Wow! 
 Do you want to start with the boathouse? 
 I do. Yeah. 
 Beautiful part of the lake. 
 It's gorgeous.

 This isn't the way to the bistro. 
 No, I wanted to show you something. I think this would be a great place for your catering business. 
 Oh! 
 Ben... I don't have the money to do it by myself. 
 I found you an investor. 
 You what? 
 Surprised?

 Nice. 
 The people are selling it all, so I get the boat, the jet skis, everything. 
 Nick's going to flip. 
 Yeah. 
 So, this is your first year teaching? 
 Yeah, I was working for my family's foundation. 
 They believe in giving back. 
 Oh! Me too. 
 I have just been so busy with my flower shop that I haven't had time to do any real volunteer work. 
 Your business is booming. 
 You just opened. That's so fast. 
 I have a way with people. 
 How so? 
 I was able to persuade a lot of people that my flower shop was a good idea, and then things just fell into place. 
 Persuade? 
 Yeah. 
 My investor, my realtor, the mayor expedited my license. 
 Well, you certainly had a way with my sister. 
 I have a way at swaying people to get them to do things the way that I want. 
 I can see that. 
 I'm just gonna go take care of this. 
 This looks like the original wood. 
 They did a lot of renovations, but they tried to use as much original material as possible. 
 Someone really loved this place. 
 I really love this place. 
 Yeah! 
 I'll probably have the pipes checked, though. 
 Yeah. If they aren't copper, they might need to be replaced. 
 Remind me to show you pictures of Grey House when I first got to town. Let's just say, I am fluent in "old home". 
 Your seventh language? 
 Yes, I guess so. 
 So what do you think? 
 It might need a little updating. 
 But most things benefit from a bit of renewal, right? 
 I'm not much of a renovator, I'm more of a 'buy it already done' kind of guy. 
 But it's got it all. 
 What? 
 The potential for a beautiful retreat, and a place for you and Nick to create memories. 
 I'd be willing to help. 
 You would? 
 Yeah! I think my energy and effort will be well-spent. 
 And appreciated. 
 Very much appreciated. 
 Dan... 
 I'm exhausted. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Every time I doze off, I get this feeling and then I jolt up and I see the ghost again. 
 The same woman from your first room? 
 I think so. Has this happened before? 
 No, never. 
 But this is an old house. 
 It is. 
 And old houses... 
 Well, did something happen with a woman who lived here? 
 I can assure you, Grey House doesn't have that kind of energy. 
 The ghost is back? 
 I'm going to check out. 
 Maybe that's best. 
 No. You're too tired to drive. 
 Stay another night. Please. I think this is where you need to be. 
 Just one more night. 
 If he starts walking around at breakfast saying he saw dead people, he's going to frighten our guests. 
 Present and future. 
 Face it, that guy needs professional help. 
 He does. 
 What are you doing here on Sunday? 
 Catching up. 
 How was the lake house? 
 Nice! Really nice. I'm considering it. 
 By the way... Valerie called. 
 Hmm... 
 I heard the hospital really wants you. 
 I am very well-informed. 
 I don't doubt it. 
 Are you also considering taking the job? 
 I told her no, but it looks like they're still considering me, doesn't it? 
 Well, you look nice. 
 Thank you. 
 Is that our wedding china? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't you think that it's maybe a bit much? 
 I just want the Bryants to feel comfortable. 
 Do they need china to feel comfortable? 
 Why did we register for them if we weren't going to use them? 
 I'm a guy... I don't know. 
 And... are you wearing that? 
 We're using our good china. 
 Yeah. 
 I just think that shirt is a little casual. 
 So, because of the dishes, I have to change my shirt? 
 Only if you want to. 
 I'll go change. 
 They're here! 
 I'll get it. 
 Tara! 
 Welcome... both of you! 
 Hi. You must be Chad. 
 Yeah. Nice to meet you. 
 And Donna. 
 Hello. 
 Brandon. Hi. 
 Oh wow! These are too pretty to eat. 
 You're going to love the chocolate laced lollypops. Do I smell baked Brie? 
 Yeah. 
 So... You're in the candy business. 
 Yes. Are you a grad student like Tara? 
 I'm a cop. 
 Cool! 
 You want a drink? 
 Absolutely. 
 All right. 
 Yoo-hoo! I just need some flowers for my office. 
 Okay. 
 So... Have you had any big orders from my husband lately? 
 No... 
 Oh. Oh! 
 I love this. 
 You can't have that one. It's for Cassie's par... 
 Par? 
 As in party? As in Cassie's having a party? 
 A party I don't know about? 
 John? 
 George let me in. 
 Are you ready for our hike? 
 We didn't make plans. 
 When did we ever need plans? 
 It's late. 
 Which is why we should leave now so we don't miss the sunset. 
 John... 
 Are you free now? 
 Yes. 
 Well, then be free. 
 Come with me. What's the worst that could happen? 
 We end up hiking in the dark. 
 I'm not afraid of the dark, are you? 
 I always had trouble saying no to you. 
 So don't. 
 All right, let's go. 
 Now that's the Cassie Nightingale I know.
