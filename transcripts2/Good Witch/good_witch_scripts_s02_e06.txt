 Previously on "Good Witch"... 
 I'm going to London! 
 What? 
 I can't give you $50,000. 
 How's Grace's training coming? 
 If you ever need to replace me, Grace would be a very good candidate. 
 Just you and I could go out. 
 Where should we go? 
 How about I surprise you? 
 ♪ 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 Well, for someone who hadn't been on a horse in a while, you seem pretty comfortable. 
 Well, you're an excellent guide. 
 And great company. I've really enjoyed this. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 So, uh, this particular risk was worth taking? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I think if you're not taking chances, you're not really living. 
 Well, there's something to be said for the occasional leap of faith. 
 That's a bit of a change of attitude. 
 You have that effect on me. 
 You're saying you're ready to take a leap? 
 (CHUCKLING) Waiting for the opportunity to present itself. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Is Alexis up? 
 She is. 
 I'm surprised she's still here. 
 I'm not. 
 We should call the police. 
 Alexis : Please don't. 
 So is this some sort of scam you're running? 
 Check in to a place, charge a bunch of stuff and then take off? 
 I had planned on paying you. 
 But you see, my father cut me off, and it's why I'm here in the first place. 
 I thought that my brother could talk to him, give me my credit cards back. 
 But he didn't want to do that? 
 No. He agrees with my dad. 
 Agrees? 
 They both think it's time that I get a real job. 
 I thought that my brother was gonna settle up the bill, but then he refused to. 
 You've asked him to do that kind of thing before? 
 I have. 
 When he wouldn't help, I didn't know what to do, so I tried to leave. 
 Are you going to call the police? 
 Yes. 
 I think we should at least call Brandon. 
 No, this isn't a matter for the police. 
 But can I trust that you won't leave until you've settled your account? 
 Yes. I promise. 
 Um, big mistake. 
 I don't trust her. 
 I'm willing to give Alexis a chance. 
 Someone needs to. 
 Uh, Dad, I need you to sign these for the study abroad group. 
 Uh, yeah, I'll, uh... I'll look them over tonight. 
 Come on. You backpacked all over Europe. 
 Yeah, after college. 
 You've never even gone on a trip alone. 
 There's a group of us going. 
 To another country! 
 It's London. 
 It's still a foreign country. 
 And a whole ocean and a long plane ride away if anything happens. 
 Yeah, in a country where everybody speaks the same language. 
 And I'm practically an adult. 
 The key word being "practically". 
 Just... 
 Give me some time to catch up, okay? Look into it. 
 All right. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hey. 
 So my mom said I could drive to the party this weekend. 
 Your mom is so cool. 
 (GIGGLING) She is. 
 Sometimes I wish we could switch parents. 
 Your mom would understand why I want to go to London. 
 London? 
 Yeah. 
 Study abroad. 
 For how long? 
 A semester. 
 I'll stay in my dorm and I'll be on my own. 
 Well, more on my own than I am here. 
 Wow. I've never been out of Middleton. 
 I think when it comes to travel, I take after my dad. 
 I'm more of a homebody. (GIGGLES) 
 You could come. 
 You could come, too. It'll be a blast. 
 No. I would miss my family too much. 
 Grace. 
 What? 
 In a few years, you're going to be in college, not at home. 
 What's the difference? 
 I guess a few years. 
 We're gonna be late. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Andrew. 
 What can I get for you? 
 Actually, I brought you something. 
 Office and cell number. 
 Are you leaving? 
 Finished all my depositions. 
 I was going to ask you for your number but I thought that was maybe too... 
 Well, I decided to give you my number. 
 That way, if you never want to hear from me again, you just don't have to call. 
 But I hope you do want to hear from me again. 
 Yeah. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 My bracelet broke. 
 Oh, no! 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I'll bring it back to Cassie and get it fixed. 
 That's sweet. Thanks. 
 I haven't heard you play in ages. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, you could find a new band to play with. 
 I was always better at managing than playing. 
 What's wrong? 
 I can tell you want your den back. 
 You're sitting in a room with no furniture. 
 Message received. 
 It's not the den. 
 Then what? 
 It's... 
 Starting a family. 
 It's so real. 
 It was always real. 
 No. It was hypothetical, us having kids, but... 
 Now, the food, the baby furniture, my den. 
 Now it's getting real. 
 It was always going to get real. 
 Everything is gonna change. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 I am totally committed to us having kids, but there's just so much change coming our way, whether we like it or not. 
 I'm just trying to wrap my head around that. 
 Ben : I can't believe that faucet broke again. I just fixed it. 
 Well, it often takes more than one crack at a problem to solve it. 
 Hmm. 
 You and Stephanie not speaking? 
 We broke up. But we're good. 
 You two don't look good. 
 I saw Stephanie with some suit-and-tie guy at the bistro. 
 She's good. 
 Better than when she was with me. 
 You don't need to wear a suit to be with Stephanie. 
 Maybe not, but there's probably a lot a guy like that can give her that I can't. 
 Well, she just wants kindness, honesty, loyalty... 
 I offered that. 
 It wasn't enough. 
 Sometimes, we have to lose something to really understand how valuable it is. 
 Tell me, how's it going with the job in Barrington? 
 Well, I'm on my way to meet the developers to hash out a contract. 
 The commute will be terrible, but it might be a nice change. 
 You know, what with everything that's happened and all. 
 John : Cassie! Cassie, I got it! I got the grant! 
 From the Hedder Foundation? 
 Yeah. It came down to the two of us. 
 We both had to present in front of the board. 
 Ten people, 15 minutes, seven figures. I killed it! 
 Let me guess, you started with the story about the caves in South Africa? 
 And finished to applause. Thank you very much. 
 Hey, sorry to interrupt. 
 Uh, sorry. Ben, this is John. John, Ben. 
 Hey there. 
 Congratulations on... 
 Whatever's got you so excited. 
 I'm heading to the Maldives for a dig. 
 John's an archeologist. 
 Oh! Like Indiana Jones. 
 (CHUCKLES) Uh, kind of, but without the whip. 
 Nice to meet you. Good luck with that. 
 Thanks. 
 Cassie. 
 We have to mark the occasion. 
 Tonight. Dinner. 
 Oh, I have to do inventory. 
 Inventory? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 No? 
 You can do inventory another night. 
 Come on, you're the only one who understands the significance of this dig. 
 I'm sure there's someone at the university who understands it as well. 
 But I don't want to celebrate with strangers. 
 I want to celebrate with a friend. 
 Come on, don't leave me hanging. 
 Ah! Okay, dinner. In the name of scientific progress. 
 Okay. 
 Grace : Yes, of course. We'll be happy to reschedule. 
 Okay, enjoy your vacation, talk to you next week. 
 Bye-bye. 
 So? What do you think? 
 I think... 
 I'm missing files. 
 Yes. 
 And all the paper off my desk. 
 Yes. You see, I figured that since the electronic calendar for Sam was such a huge success, why not go paperless? 
 Paperless? 
 Yes. 
 (GASPS) 
 Helps us, helps the planet. 
 (GIGGLES) I came in early. 
 Sam let me in. He loved the idea. 
 I'm not totally finished yet but I've got most of everything scanned into the computer already. 
 I mean, come on, you've got to admit, Eve, paper is a little old school. 
 Here. Let me show you something. 
 Okay. 
 Here is the client database. 
 Okay. 
 Click here and you can see their chart, personal history, upcoming appointments. 
 Everything. 
 What if something happens to the computer? 
 Oh, I set it to automatically back up. 
 And all of the papers on your desk are already in here. 
 Whatever I didn't know, I put in a miscellaneous file, which is right over there. 
 As for the papers that we do need, such as insurance, rental agreements, well, that is all right here. (CHUCKLES) 
 How are things going out here? 
 Good! 
 Excuse me. 
 Hmm. 
 I, um... 
 I'm not sure if Eve likes the whole idea of going paperless. 
 Maybe she has a feeling if we replace the paper, she might be next. 
 But Eve is awesome. 
 It was something she said last week. 
 I think she's having a rough time settling in with me, and here at the office. 
 Maybe she just needs to be reminded of how important she is. 
 I've told her. 
 Mom always says that words can only get you so far. 
 I don't know what else I can do. 
 My head is exploding. 
 My own special blend. 
 You'll be feeling like yourself again in no time. 
 I told Michael I wouldn't loan him the money for his new business and it's been wreaking havoc on my body. 
 Michael isn't very happy with you. 
 He won't even speak to me. I can't stand it! 
 Which is why I've decided, when I get home tonight, I'm just going to write him a check and put this whole awful incident behind us. 
 Hmm. 
 I always think time gives perspective. 
 I don't need more time and I have a very clear perspective. 
 Wait, look, there it is. 
 A split end! 
 And I have chalky skin! 
 I mean, have you ever known my hair or complexion to be anything less than perfect? 
 I accidentally took George's keys this morning. 
 Oh, how fascinating. 
 Since I can't get away, would you take them to Grey House? 
 Oh, well, it really isn't in my way... 
 Honestly, I can never say no to you, can I? 
 Thanks, Martha. 
 Mmm-hmm! 
 Cassie : Hmm. 
 Have you figured out how to settle your bill? 
 I don't know what I can do to pay you back. 
 I guess you might as well just call the police. 
 That's not gonna help you. 
 Thank you. 
 I really am sorry. 
 I know you are and I accept your apology. 
 But I'm not the only one you have to make amends to. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Can I get your word that you won't leave Middleton until you make things right with everyone involved? 
 (WHISPERS) Okay. 
 Doug, this Stephanie, she owns the bistro. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Doug's an old friend from New York. 
 We were in the wars together. 
 ER. 
 Doug is the best trauma surgeon in New York. 
 Sam, you're being far too modest, he was the real star there, not me. 
 Well, we are very lucky to have him here in Middleton. 
 You sure are. 
 (GIGGLES) Excuse me. 
 Well, this has been great. 
 I hardly ever make it up this far north of Chicago. 
 Well, I'm glad you did. 
 There's something I forgot to tell you about. 
 I was playing tennis with Gary Nelson last week. 
 Our old boss from the hospital? 
 That's right. 
 He said the CEO of Hillcrest Hospital called him. 
 They're looking for a new chief of staff. 
 Hillcrest here? 
 Uh-huh. 
 They were calling about you, Sam. 
 Gary said the CEO told him that getting you to run Hillcrest would be a coup for them. 
 Chief of staff, huh? 
 Big time in a small town. 
 Stephanie : Careful, hot plates. 
 Ooh, you okay? 
 Ugh. I'll survive. 
 I'm just a little distracted. I heard a rumor. 
 At least, I hope it's a rumor. 
 Is Ben taking a job in Barrington? 
 He is. 
 But that's the next town over. 
 He's planning on commuting. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, it seems like Ben's moving on, so maybe I should do the same thing. 
 Andrew gave me his number. 
 He's nice. 
 No, he's perfect. 
 (STAMMERING) He's the kind of guy I always thought I would end up with. 
 Andrew would be the safe choice. 
 But sometimes safe isn't as rewarding as it is safe. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi! 
 Steph, could I trouble you for a cup of black coffee to go? 
 Coming right up. 
 Beautiful bracelet. 
 Oh. It's broken, actually. 
 I was just on my way to your store to find out if you could repair it. 
 Oh, sadly, I can't. 
 But I'll give you the name and address of the artist. 
 She's local and she can fix you right up. 
 Great. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Good luck. 
 Those are pretty. 
 If you're here for more free flowers, you've come to the wrong place. 
 I'm here because I don't know how to pay you back. 
 I'm not as forgiving as my cousin Cassie. 
 Hi. Welcome to Abigail's. I'm Abigail. 
 This is my brother Greg. 
 You coming? I gotta get back to work. 
 She's not. She's staying. 
 I am? 
 You need to work off your debt. 
 I just booked a last minute wedding and I need help arranging centerpieces. 
 The only thing I know how to do with flowers is order them. 
 Then for your sake, I hope you're a fast learner. 
 I've never worked anywhere. I have no idea what I'm doing. 
 Are you sure you want me to stay? 
 I'm sure. 
 Start dethorning. 
 You're welcome to come back and pick up your sister when I close. 
 I'll see you later then. 
 I look forward to it. 
 Ow! 
 Hey! 
 Hello. 
 I was wondering if you had any... 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I see you were expecting me. 
 Nick is not giving up on going to London. 
 I loved my time there. 
 Yeah, but would you send Grace there? 
 I would. I'm sorry. 
 But they're so young. 
 I trust her. 
 Yeah, but... 
 One of the hardest things we can do as parents is letting go. 
 I felt like I finally got Nick on the right track. 
 He's doing great in school, he's happy with his mother. 
 He hasn't been in any serious trouble since we left New York. 
 He's doing great. 
 (SIGHS) I just don't think he's ready to be on his own. 
 I don't trust that he'll make good decisions when he's faced with tempting choices. 
 Hmm. We can't stop our kids from making mistakes any more than our parents could stop us. 
 How can you be so okay with all of this? 
 Maybe it's because my child doesn't want to go to London. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Excuse me. 
 Hello? Hey, John. 
 Yeah, no problem. 
 Yeah, I can meet you at the restaurant. 
 Okay, I'll see you tonight. 
 Dinner with the good professor? 
 Yeah, I'm helping him celebrate. 
 He just got a big grant to fund a dig in the Maldives. 
 That's definitely worth celebrating. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, maybe tomorrow night I can come over and you could give me a crash course on your London experience. 
 I'd love to. 
 And then, maybe after, play a few hands of poker. 
 All right. What are we playing for? 
 I'll leave that up to you. 
 Pennies. 
 (CHUCKLES) High stakes it is. 
 Oh, speaking of high stakes, I just found out that Hillcrest hospital might offer me their chief of staff job. 
 Oh. What about your practice here? 
 Yeah. I don't want to give it up. 
 You miss working in hospitals? 
 (CHUCKLES) I won't lie. 
 Hospitals, ERs, that's really been my thing ever since med school. 
 You're considering it? 
 I guess I am. 
 Grace, can you see if we can push Mrs. James' appointment back 15 minutes? 
 I'm on it. 
 Okay. 
 (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) 
 (NERVOUSLY) Eve? 
 What? 
 The computer crashed. 
 That doesn't work. 
 Sam : Ladies. 
 Did you send me my afternoon schedule? 
 Uh... 
 Computers are down. 
 Oh. Just give me a hard copy. 
 (INHALES) 
 You have Mr. Crenshaw at 3:30 for a follow-up on his chest X-ray. 
 Then a 20-minute break, and Mrs. Schofield is in at 4:15. 
 She's looking for a physiotherapy referral. 
 Thanks. 
 (WHISPERING) No problem. 
 Oh, and can you free up some time for me tomorrow? 
 Just push my appointments back an hour or so. 
 I've got a meeting at Nick's school. 
 I'll call your patients and reschedule. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 So what do we do? 
 We need to get someone in here to fix the computer so we can rearrange Dr. Radford's appointments. 
 I need the schedule and the contact info, and it's all... 
 In there. 
 I didn't do all the charts, so... 
 Yes, but if I don't have the schedule, then I don't know who to call. 
 You know what? 
 Let me call the computer guy. 
 Yes. 
 I am the one who made the office go paperless. 
 Let me help. 
 Thanks, Grace. 
 
 
 
 George : Martha? 
 (GASPS) 
 Oh! 
 Honestly, George! 
 What are you doing skulking around? 
 I can't skulk, I live here. 
 Never mind. 
 I understand these belong to you? 
 I could've sworn those were right here. 
 Have a lovely evening. 
 We've got a problem. 
 Cassie gave me those keys. 
 Not the keys. 
 The giant pothole at the corner of James and Elm. 
 A pothole? 
 It nearly blew out my tire the other day. 
 I'm sure that your retelling of the malfeasance that happened to you and your automobile will no doubt be as riveting as this conversation. 
 However, my son is waiting for me at home, so perhaps we could deal with this issue at a later date, hmm? 
 Your campaign slogan said, "I always have time." 
 So sorry, no time. Michael is expecting me. 
 Constituent to mayor... 
 (SIGHS) 
 We need to talk. 
 Please, continue to rivet me. 
 I took some pictures. 
 Of a hole in the road? 
 I have some video, too. 
 Wonderful. And so thorough. (CHUCKLES) 
 Come on, I'll show them to you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 John : Thank you. 
 To the future. 
 And the past. 
 Congratulations, truly. 
 This Maldives excavation will be extraordinary. 
 So much to do. I have to finalize the proposal. 
 I have to put a team together... 
 What? 
 I was thinking you could help me sort through all the applicants. 
 Sure. 
 Oh... 
 None of this makes sense. 
 What's that? 
 I'm at the right place at the right time, finally. 
 What doesn't make sense about that? 
 That the right place is Middleton. 
 Well, I told you it was special. 
 It's not just the place. It's the people. 
 I'm glad we reconnected. 
 Me, too. 
 Thanks for this. I didn't want to celebrate alone. 
 You're a good friend. 
 So, what did the computer guy say? 
 Well, good news. He got the system back up. 
 Great. 
 Bad news, he can't recover any of the files I scanned in, including the master appointment calendar. 
 What are we going to do? 
 We're going old school. 
 What? Oh. 
 We need to find my Rolodex. 
 So you need to go through all the boxes in the storage room and the ones I brought from home. 
 You got it. 
 Just one thing. 
 Mmm-hmm? 
 What's a Rolodex? 
 It's like a big plastic wheel with cards. 
 It has my backup contact info for all the patient files. 
 Hey, that will give us the phone numbers we need. 
 And then we need to find my backup calendar. 
 And that will tell us who we need to call. 
 Exactly. It was on my desk, in my papers. 
 I scanned everything into the computer. 
 I don't remember seeing a calendar. 
 It was just a sheet of paper. 
 All the papers you scanned from the files got mixed up in the back waiting to be shredded. 
 Shredded. 
 You know what, Eve, you should just tell Sam that I messed up. 
 No. We can fix this. 
 And once we do, no one needs to know anything about it. 
 You know, I am so lucky to be interning with you. 
 Thank you, Dr. Radford. 
 Oh, sure, anytime. 
 Just spring cleaning. 
 Yep. 
 Okay. Great. 
 Here. 100 dethorned roses. 
 I always thought the roses in those arrangements were some special kind of thornless rose. 
 I had no idea someone had to do that by hand. 
 I need you to hot glue the ribbon over there to these vases, like this. 
 I sense you have the soul of a very crafty person. 
 That's going to take forever. 
 Well, time is money and you don't have any money, so you owe me time. 
 Will this finish it? 
 Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
 Okay? 
 Stephanie : Got your message. 
 Hi! 
 You know, when people order flowers from you, they expect you to deliver them. 
 But you're so close. 
 Oh, yeah, she's working for me. Temporarily. 
 Ah. 
 Here. 
 There's no card. 
 They're from Ben. 
 Ben sent me flowers? 
 He did. 
 Thanks. 
 It's not me you should be thanking. 
 (CELL PHONE CHIMES) 
 Oh, my brother wants to know what time I'll be finished. 
 Well, I close at 6:00. 
 But I doubt you'll be done by then. 
 So let's talk about this brother of yours. 
 I didn't see a ring. 
 He's single. 
 Nice. 
 He's never had a serious girlfriend before. 
 And why do you think that is? 
 Well, he... 
 Don't stop. 
 You can glue and talk. 
 Tara :  What's this?  CASSIE:  For you. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Brandon's grandmother knitted this. 
 Aw, that is so sweet! 
 Three generations of Russells have worn these. 
 Oh, you should really keep all this. 
 Well, Jake would have wanted Brandon to have those. 
 He would have wanted both of you to have those. 
 I don't have anything from when I was a baby. 
 Everything got lost when I went to live with my aunt. 
 Yeah, my parents died when I was so young, I don't think anyone was making sure I had keepsakes, it was more about whether or not I had a home. 
 I've been thinking a lot about my mom lately. 
 Instinctively we want to hold on to the past because change is scary. 
 But I think we can make it less scary by being super prepared. 
 Were you? 
 I was more ready to be a mother than a wife. 
 Mostly because I didn't have good role models. 
 My foster parents had a bad marriage. 
 So how did you deal with everything? 
 I took a big breath, I closed my eyes and I jumped in with both feet and a full heart. 
 I messed some things up and other things I got right, and somehow it all worked out because I wasn't alone anymore. 
 I had Jake, and together, we rode out the bad times and we celebrated the good. 
 Outside, you guys, Mom's got to work to do. 
 (CHILDREN LAUGHING) 
 They're really cute. 
 I have three adorable little monsters who look a lot like children. 
 What have you got for me? 
 Oh, um... 
 Here. 
 Oh, yeah, I can fix that. Have a seat. 
 Thanks. 
 My wife really loves it. 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 (CHILDREN LAUGHING) 
 You really have your hands full here, huh? 
 (CHUCKLES) Sometimes I can't believe this is my life. 
 How so? 
 I was a free spirit. 
 I never stayed in one place for very long. 
 I lived an artist's life. 
 And now? 
 And now I'm a mom. 
 You don't miss the free spirit stuff? 
 I don't even remember my life before my husband and kids. 
 I try to live in the now, not the then. 
 Kids help with that, you don't have time to go back and rethink everything, you have to be in the present, for them. 
 You seem very calm. 
 (LAUGHING) Living in all of this chaos? 
 Oh, I didn't mean... 
 No, no. It's true. 
 I have a beautiful chaotic life that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world. 
 You're so sure. 
 The way I look at it, with big risks come big rewards. 
 And some big messes. (LAUGHS) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Michael :  This is Michael. Leave me a message.  (BEEP) 
 Michael, please call me the minute that you get this. 
 I'm so sorry, I was thinking... 
 Hey, Mom. 
 By the time I got home to talk to you last night you were gone. 
 I was delayed talking to George. 
 So I waited up and then I called... 
 I just needed to blow off some steam. I feel better. 
 I'm so glad you're okay. I was... 
 Are those new sneakers? 
 I didn't have any cash, so I put them on your credit card, I hope that's okay. 
 Dad told me that you changed your mind. 
 He said you were going to write me a check. 
 I was, before I spoke to Cassie. 
 And then I got some perspective. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means no money for your business idea. 
 It means I need to stop helping you figure things out. 
 You need to stand on your own two feet. 
 Why? 
 Because it's better for you. 
 Is this because I bought the shoes without asking? 
 Oh! No, no, sweetie. 
 This is because I love you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hey. 
 So, you have a meeting with my teacher about London? 
 Yeah, late afternoon. 
 He's awesome. 
 Um, maybe I should go with you when you talk to Greg. 
 Greg? 
 Oh, my... My teacher. 
 I know he's your teacher, but you call him Greg? 
 He thinks formality's kind of old-fashioned. 
 He says we should all be equals. 
 I think, um, I should talk to Greg by myself. 
 Sorry. 
 Dr. Radford, there's a Mr. Graham on line one. 
 From Hillcrest. 
 Hmm. Thanks, Eve. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I think Hillcrest wants me to run their hospital. 
 Cool. 
 Well, I'd be home a lot less. 
 You should do it. 
 College is not that far off. 
 Three years and I'm gone. 
 Well, I've got stuff to do, so, see you at home. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I just wanted to thank you. 
 For what? 
 The flowers you sent. 
 I didn't. 
 Abigail said they were from you. 
 She made a mistake. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, well, sorry to bother you. 
 But you're here. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Ben, I was never embarrassed by what you do or who you are. 
 I am embarrassed by the way I acted, though. 
 I'm not going to change who I am. 
 And you don't have to. Neither of us do. 
 But, Ben, we belong together. 
 Or at least we deserve the chance to see if we belong together. 
 I should go. 
 I just hope you find someone who deserves you. 
 Hey! 
 What was that? 
 A goodbye kiss. 
 It didn't feel like goodbye. 
 Maybe we can call it a... 
 Starting over kiss? 
 Yeah. 
 Remind me to thank Abigail. 
 For what? 
 Making a mistake on those flowers. 
 Well, maybe we should send her some flowers. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Is Abigail home? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Oh, I just finished all the vases she wanted me to glue gun. 
 For your cuts and burns. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Sounds like you did some real work today. 
 Yeah. I have never worked so hard in my entire life. 
 I can tell. 
 I definitely paid off my debt to Abigail, but not to you, and that doesn't feel right. 
 You took a chance and proved to yourself that you are more capable than you thought. 
 (SCOFFS) You mean by working? 
 Yes. And because of that, I consider your account settled. 
 So what's next for you? 
 Well, I called my dad and talked to him. 
 Greg talked to him, too. 
 And when I go back home, I'm gonna look for a real job. 
 Well, sounds like a good start. 
 I just hope somebody will take a chance on me the way you did, hire me. 
 Hmm, well, you have faith in yourself now. 
 Other people will see that, and the rest will fall into place. 
 Thank you for trusting me enough to let me work for you. 
 Well, you didn't let me down. 
 She did a really good job. 
 Oh, one more thing. 
 I gave my brother your phone number. I hope that's okay. 
 Consider your debt paid in full. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 You know, you could have had her do work around here or the shop to pay you back, too. 
 Oh, she did the work she was supposed to do. 
 Stephanie called. Her and Ben are back together. 
 Really? 
 Why do I have a feeling that you had something to do with that? 
 I might have accidentally sent her a flower arrangement from Ben. 
 She just needed a little push to be reminded what a great guy he is. 
 You don't let great guys get away. 
 That was very sweet. 
 Also, if they're back together, then I don't have to listen to her whine about it anymore. 
 Hey. Okay, so I found the Rolodex thingy, but I can't find the calendar in those papers anywhere. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Eve, I think it might be time to tell Sam. 
 No. 
 I can fix this. 
 Oh! 
 Here, I'll get it. 
 Hey! That's my backup calendar. 
 Oh, that? I thought that that was trash. 
 It was here the whole time. 
 We've got to start calling people. 
 Eve, I'm so glad that you were here to help save the day. 
 Hey, the system seems to be up and running and not one glitch during the crash! 
 You both did a great job troubleshooting. 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Dr. Radford's office. 
 I know what you did. 
 Eve did it all. 
 You really are your mother's daughter, aren't you? 
 I am. 
 Uh, Mr. Braithwaite? 
 Sam. Please, call me Greg. 
 I'm glad you called. Have a seat. 
 Well, Nick is really excited about the idea of studying abroad. 
 That's a great learning opportunity. 
 See, I don't think Nick is really as interested in the educational part as he is the freedom part. 
 Really? 
 I don't think he's ready for this kind of trip. 
 What kind of trip is that? 
 The kind where I'm not there. 
 I'll be there, and there will be other teachers. 
 Nick's young and impulsive. 
 And he hasn't always made the best choices. 
 He's very mature for his age. 
 He's becoming more mature. 
 You're referring to his trouble in New York? 
 Nick told you about that? 
 My parents divorced when I was young, too. 
 I know, whether you want to or not, you grow up faster and learn to become more self-sufficient because of that. 
 Nick talks about our family? 
 He talks about a lot. 
 He wants to do this. 
 He's an extraordinary kid. 
 But he's still a kid. 
 I think he's ready for it. 
 I don't. 
 I can talk to him about your concerns if you want. 
 I'll talk to him. 
 He's my son. 
 I know you probably mean well, but I know him. 
 And he needs structure, guidelines, rules, a system in place that supports that. 
 I'm that system. 
 It is "study" abroad. It's not a vacation. 
 There is plenty of structure. 
 I don't want to lose the progress that he's made since moving here. 
 I don't feel like this is the best choice for him. Now. 
 Maybe when he's a senior. 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 I'm sure you are. 
 Tara : You bought a changing table? 
 It's not the one from the catalog. 
 No, it's better. 
 Because you picked it out. 
 I thought you wanted to take a breath. 
 I got this fixed for you. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, this den, it's about who I used to be. 
 It's time to change that. 
 The way I see it, I'm not losing a den, we are gaining a baby's room. 
 Really? 
 Everyone looks back and wonders if they took the right fork in the road. 
 Well, this is our fork. 
 And we're headed the right way. 
 We can handle any change that comes our way because we're not alone. 
 Full house. 
 (SAM GROANS) 
 Are you going to give me an opportunity to win my money back? 
 You shouldn't have gone all in on that last hand. 
 You knew I was bluffing? 
 And yet you took my pennies anyway? 
 Never bet what you're not willing to lose. 
 Really? I thought you were all about taking chances. 
 Some things aren't worth losing. 
 And sometimes the gamble pays off. 
 I demand a rematch. 
 Oh, you want to take me on again? 
 Oh, confidence. 
 Well, I did just win. 
 True. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Here, try this. 
 Oh, that's good. Chili? 
 Wait! Wait, don't tell me. 
 It tastes like meat, I so want to believe it's meat. 
 Suspension of disbelief. 
 Works for me. 
 Yeah, works a lot of things. 
 Hey! 
 Abigail! 
 Hi. 
 Oh, good, I'm starving. 
 Well, I made plenty. 
 Great. I'll take a big bowl. 
 Um, with cheese and sour cream, too, please. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Ahem. 
 Ooh! 
 I love poker. I'm in. 
 (EXHALES) 
 (SNICKERS)
