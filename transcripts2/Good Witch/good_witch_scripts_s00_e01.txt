 (SOUND OF STORM) 
  Derrick, it's Jake. 
  I'm parked at the corner of 3rd and Main. 
  I'm going out on foot patrol. 
  I don't know Jake. 
  It's a pretty rough neighborhood; lots of little old ladies who know how to swing a purse. 
  Very funny. 
  (CAT SOUND) 
  Hello? 
  Hello? 
  (CAT SOUND) 
  Anybody there? 
  - Walter? 
  - Hm? 
  Ah, Walter! 
  Come on. 
  What are you doing out here? 
  They kicked me out of the motel. 
  Well you can't stay here Walter. 
  What am I gonna do? 
  Come on. 
  You can stay in the jail tonight and tomorrow you gotta find a place to live. 
  You can't live in an alley. 
  Thanks Jake. 
  Thanks. 
  All right. 
  Okay. 
  Come on. 
  Can you get up? 
  Yeah. 
  Come on, put your arm on me here. 
  That's it. 
  George what are you doing up? 
  Lori's having nightmares again. 
  I stayed up to keep her company. 
  Again, huh? 
  I was hoping those were over. 
  Children have nightmares. 
  Yeah, but not like this. 
  It's been three years. 
  It started when Jenny it's been hard for all of us. 
  I miss my daughter too. 
  You know, I appreciate everything you've done, but I can get some help in here, give you a break. 
  Don't worry about me. 
  Worry about your kids. 
  I mean every day. 
  (music) 
  Daddy. 
  Honey, I'm sorry. 
  I didn't mean to wake you. 
  The monsters are back. 
  Well I promise we're going to do something about those monsters. 
  Can you sleep here? 
  Please? 
  Okay, I'm going to check on Brandon and then I'll come back and sit with you for a while. 
  And if those monsters come around, I'll arrest them. 
  You can't arrest monsters. 
  Everybody knows that. 
  Brandon why aren't you in bed? 
  I'm not tired. 
  It's a school night. 
  Turn off the computer and get to bed. 
  Brandon! 
  Listen I thought maybe Saturday we'd go done to the park and throw the ball around a bit. 
  What do you think? 
  Whatever. . 
  Okay, we'll talk about it tomorrow. 
  (music) 
  Come on, hurry up. 
  I'm tired. 
  I'll make you a deal: I'll trade you your dream monsters for a real one. 
  What do you mean? 
  Never mind. 
  (EERIE SOUNDS) 
  The Grey lady. 
  What? 
  I just saw the Grey lady. 
  - Where? 
  - In the window up there. 
  - I don't see anything. 
  - She was there. 
  You're just imagining it, just like you imagine all your other monsters. 
  It was her. 
  The ghost of Grey house. 
  Whatever. 
  Come on, we're gonna be late. 
  But I really did see her. 
  Wait. 
  (music) 
  (music) 
  Good morning Derrick. 
  What are you doing here so early? 
  My job. 
  - Something going on? 
  - No. 
  I didn't think so. 
  I'm heading out Cruising the streets of Middleton. 
  That should take all of 10 minutes. 
  Well, I can't sit around here all day like you do. 
  Don't know it till you've tried it. 
  (music) 
  Mrs. 
  Tinsdale. 
  - Chief Russell. 
  - Martha. 
  Good morning. 
  What can I do for you today? 
  I am astounded that you let that drunken Walter Cobb out of jail. 
  I just saw him leave here and stumble down the street. 
  Now it's your responsibility to keep our streets safe. 
  Okay, I'll have a talk with him. 
  Oh, you need to do more than talk. 
  Anything else? 
  There's a rumor going around that someone is occupying Grey house. 
  Grey house. 
  Who would want to live there? 
  Probably some little old lady with 15 cats. 
  Several members of the Citizen's League have reported strange smells coming from the place. 
  Smells? 
  What kind of smells? 
  Chemical smells, which makes me wonder if someone hasn't set up a drug lab. 
  A drug lab. 
  In Middleton? 
  You need to check on it. 
  I will. 
  - I'll check on it right away. 
  - Good. 
  - I'll meet you there. 
  - No, you don't have to do that. 
  Chief Russell, as chairperson of the Citizen's League, it is my responsibility to keep apprised of all developments in our community. 
  You're right. 
  I'll see you there. 
  Nosy old bat. 
  I think she wants to be mayor more than her husband. 
  More like Emperor. 
  Come on Lori. 
  (DOGS BARKING) 
  (DOGS BARKING) 
  I'm sure it's nothing, - but just stay behind me. 
  - Gladly. 
  Seems pretty quiet. 
  Mrs. 
  Perkins saw lights switch off last night. 
  Police department. 
  Hello? 
  Hello? 
  Hello? 
  - Anybody back there? 
  - (CAT SOUND) 
  Welcome. 
  Your name please? 
  Cassandra Nightingale. 
  Do you ? 
  Do you reside on these premises? 
  I live here, if that's what you mean. 
  You you own Grey house? 
  Grey house? 
  This residence. 
  Is that what you call it, Grey house? 
  Hm. 
  Yeah, I like the vibe. 
  This property is yours? 
  Well that's what it says on the deed. 
  I didn't realize that anyone had moved in. 
  It's been empty for such a long, long time. 
  Ma'am, I'm very sorry for walking into your home. 
  Miss. 
  Miss. 
  I'm Chief Russell, with the Middleton Police Department. 
  This is um Mrs. 
  Martha Tinsdale. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  So you'll be living here by yourself. 
  Oh, no, no, I have Isis. 
  Isis? 
  Isis is your cat? 
  Not exactly, it's more of a mutual admiration society. 
  Yesterday downtown; was that you that I saw walking into the alley? 
  Chief Russell, how would I know what you saw yesterday? 
  Only you know what you saw yesterday. 
  As the new owner, what are your plans for the property? 
  Oh, I'm not a planner Mrs. 
  Tinsdale. 
  Well, I assume demolition and then new construction. 
  Well, I think it has character. 
  Character? 
  I see the beauty beneath the surface. 
  Miss Nightingale this community has standards. 
  I can sense that. 
  Martha. 
  My apologies. 
  I did see the Grey lady this morning. 
  - You've got to believe me. 
  - I believe you. 
  - Whatever. 
  - No you don't. 
  You're just saying that. 
  Just drop it will you? 
  What happened to the dog? 
  (DOG BARKING) 
  Okay, okay. 
  (DOG BARKING) 
  Here he comes! 
  I know, I know, you're a good dog. 
  It's your master that's the beast. 
  Now I want you to go home and stop scaring those children half to death, and I don't want to see that kind of behavior again. 
  All right? 
  Now go on. 
  Go. 
  How'd you do that? 
  I've always had a way with the fur people. 
  I'm Cassie. 
  Cassie Nightingale. 
  I'm Brandon. 
  This is Lori. 
  You two all right? 
  We'd better put something on that. 
  Why don't you come inside? 
  You live here? 
  That's right. 
  But this is Grey house. 
  Don't you know it's haunted? 
  So I hear, but surely you two brave children aren't afraid of some little only ghost? 
  Told you I saw someone. 
  Well, you'll have to excuse the mess. 
  I haven't had time to do much cleaning. 
  Come on. 
  Why don't you sit down? 
  LORI: What did you whisper to that dog? 
  I told him that it was very bad manners to eat children. 
  These are special healing herbs; my own recipe. 
  They'll fix you up in no time. 
  There you go. 
  Good as new. 
  Oh, you smell like Jasmine. 
  It's my mother's perfume. 
  Well I can see why she likes it. 
  Would you like some gingerbread? 
  - Gingerbread? 
  - It's fresh out of the oven. 
  (CAT SOUNDS) 
  Isis, calm down. 
  That big dog went home. 
  Here you go. 
  Okay we've got to be going. 
  Thanks for your help. 
  Come back and visit. 
  Anytime. 
  Good afternoon. 
  Black with sugar. 
  Did I guess right? 
  Yeah, thanks. 
  And I hope you like turkey. 
  Why are you doing this? 
  You look like you skipped breakfast. 
  I don't need your help lady. 
  No, but I need your help. 
  Can't move boxes on an empty stomach. 
  Let me know when you're ready. 
  Hey Jake! 
  Wait a minute. 
  Hey, Rusty. 
  Jake look, just look at him. 
  He's ruined. 
  What, Attila, what's wrong with him. 
  He won't bark, he won't growl no more. 
  He just sits there with his nose under his paws. 
  - That's a bad thing? 
  - She did this. 
  Who? 
  That witchy woman over in Grey house. 
  She did something to my boy. 
  Miss Nightingale? 
  She did something that's unnatural. 
  Come on, you can't be serious. 
  I'm dead serious and I want to file a complaint. 
  Okay, I'll look into it. 
  You just watch your back or that witch will take the bark out of you too. 
  She's a witch. 
  Witches don't exist. 
  But she can do magic. 
  Magic doesn't exist either. 
  Maybe she's the Grey lady. 
  Lori, you're driving me crazy. 
  Why don't you just leave me alone, okay? 
  Lori Not so fast where is it? 
  I don't have any money, not today. 
  My grandpa packed my lunch. 
  Let me see. 
  I guess I'll just have to take this instead. 
  Tomorrow, tell your grandpa you want money instead of this crap. 
  If you don't, you're not the only who's going to get hurt. 
  What do you mean? 
  It'd be a shame if anything happened to your little sister. 
  You leave her alone! 
  Grandpa. 
  Hey Brandon. 
  You used to box right? 
  A long, long time ago. 
  Can you will you teach me how to fight? 
  What do you want to learn how to do that for? 
  Well, I just want to be able to take care of myself. 
  Well, I wouldn't make much of a sparring partner. 
  Why don't you ask your father? 
  Something wrong? 
  Just forget about it. 
  - Chief Russell? 
  - Hello again. 
  Did you come to deliver those community standards? 
  Oh, you have to understand, Mrs. 
  Tinsdale she tends to get a little passionate about things. 
  Hm. 
  Passion is good. 
  Come on in. 
  Uh, watch the boxes. 
  Would you like some herb tea? 
  It's my own special blend. 
  Who's that? 
  The infamous Grey lady. 
  She was here when I arrived. 
  She looks like you. 
  Do I look that cracked and faded? 
  Oh listen the reason I'm here is about this disturbance with the Doberman. 
  Oh, that. 
  Well don't blame the dog, I mean, he's just unhappy being chained up all day. 
  Well, no one's blaming the dog. 
  The owner is blaming you. 
  He's thinking of pressing charges. 
  Rusty, the owner, claims that you changed his dog somehow. 
  Well yeah, I did. 
  Oh. 
  Well, I had a talk with him. 
  Well, you talked with Rusty? 
  No, with the dog. 
  What exactly did you say? 
  I told him he was a good dog and his master was a beast. 
  Of course, I didn't want the children to hear - so I whispered - The children? 
  Yeah, the dog got loose and chased them into my yard. 
  Okay, so Attila was on your property. 
  That's right. 
  Okay, Rusty didn't tell me that. 
  The little girl Lori scraped her knee, - so I treated her. . 
  - Lori? 
  Did she have a brother named Brandon? 
  You know them? 
  Yeah, I know them. 
  They're my kids. 
  They didn't tell me about this. 
  Well they probably didn't want it on their police record. 
  I'm sure they told their mom. 
  No, no, their mom their mom died three years ago. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  They're wonderful kids. 
  - I know. 
  - Thanks. 
  Would you like that tea now? 
  Or coffee? 
  Because I know that cops drink coffee and donuts. 
  - Dozens of them. 
  - Yeah. 
  They also wear those big dark glasses so - nobody knows what we're thinking. 
  - Right. 
  Oh, maybe some other time. 
  - Okay. 
  Sure. 
  - Thanks. 
  Drop by any time neighbor. 
  Or come see my new shop. 
  Shop? 
  Yeah, I'm opening a small shot on 3rd and Main. 
  When? 
  What's today? 
  Tuesday. 
  A week from tomorrow. 
  My ads in the paper. 
  Well, you're taking on a lot. 
  I like a challenge. 
  Well I'll see you later Chief Russell. 
  Jake. 
  Call me Jake. 
  Everybody calls me Jake. 
  Well then I guess lucky that's your name. 
  It's a trick. 
  A trick? 
  Bye. 
  How's it going? 
  Intense. 
  Almost as intense as being chased by a dog over at Grey house. 
  Did you want to tell me about that? 
  Not really. 
  So I hear you want to learn how to fight. 
  It's nothing. 
  Somebody bothering you? 
  Just forget about it. 
  You got a problem with somebody you know you can talk to me about it. 
  Okay well when you're ready to talk I'm here for you okay. 
  Trying to hide from me dweeb? 
  Hand it over! 
  - Is this all of it? 
  - It's everything. 
  Good. 
  See you tomorrow you little creep. 
  Bell, Book and Candle. 
  Jake. 
  Good morning. 
  Look at this place! 
  This was vacant. 
  It was boarded up. 
  Yeah, I've been working on the inside since I got here. 
  But still Well, if you make up your mind you want something, all the obstacles seem to vanish. 
  You've got a lot of interesting things. 
  Now all I need is customers. 
  Herbs. 
  Oh, they're all perfectly legal officer. 
  You're not under investigation. 
  I like the masks. 
  Thanks, they're from my travels. 
  You travel a lot? 
  Life's a journey, not a destination. 
  I travelled a lot. 
  I mean, my parents moved around a lot. 
  An Army brat. 
  So I swore when I get married I'm going to stay in one place just for the kids. 
  It's not every dad that gives his daughter a big hug before he leaves for work. 
  - She tell you that? 
  - No, Jasmine. 
  You're daughter loves to pour it on. 
  Oh, I can't even smell it. 
  Oh really. 
  It's a beautiful scent. 
  It was my wife's favorite. 
  You all must miss her very much. 
  Here, take a whiff of this. 
  Whoa! 
  That'll clear your sinuses. 
  Yeah, it'll do a lot more than that. 
  How much? 
  Five dollars. 
  Satisfaction guaranteed. 
  It's a bargain. 
  You're my first customer. 
  Thanks. 
  Well, good luck with the shop Miss Nightingale. 
  Cassie. 
  Cassie. 
  Cassie. 
  And on your left is Grey House, so named because it's original owner Elizabeth Merriwick was fond of wearing Grey. 
  Now as you see the house has suffered from decades of neglect. 
  Another example of Middleton's Motto: Looking to the Future, Building on the Past. 
  Moving right along Maybe they'd like to hear the legend of the Grey Lady? 
  Just a local legend popular with school children and the deluded. 
  Apparently she married some sailor who hoisted anchor then left her to languish and perish nearly a century ago. 
  It's a depressing story. 
  His name was Captain Charles Hamlin, splendid in his naval uniform. 
  It was love at first sight. 
  They spend two passionate months together till he was called to duty, never to return. 
  But every night for 28 years Elizabeth kept a light burning in the window until one night the light went out and Elizabeth was found dead of a broken heart. 
  Anyway, that's one version. 
  Hello Mrs. 
  Tinsdale and hi everyone, I'm Cassie Nightingale, - owner of Grey House. 
  - Oh! 
  Would you like to come inside for a tour? 
  We're on a very tight schedule. 
  Well, the invitation is open, anytime. 
  And if you'd like you can stop by my new shop on Main, - The Bell, Book & Candle Shop. 
  - Your shop? 
  What do you sell? 
  Infinite possibilities. 
  And moving right along come along ladies. 
  - Thank you, that was wonderful. 
  - Nancy! 
  Hello Lori. 
  Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. 
  I'm not scared. 
  How's your knee doing? 
  It's all better. 
  Dog's not bothering you anymore, is he? 
  No. 
  Can you. . ? 
  Can I what? 
  Can you do something about monsters? 
  Are monsters bothering you Lori? 
  Can you make them go away, like you made the dog go away? 
  When are they bothering you? 
  - At night. 
  - I see. 
  Monsters are a bit trickier than dogs. 
  They really can't hurt you but they make you think they can. 
  I have something in mind that might help. 
  Do you know what this is? 
  It's called a dream catcher. 
  This is a special one blessed by a Lakota Shaman. 
  The webbing catches bad dreams before they reach you, letting good dreams pass through and trickle down the feathers. 
  You need to hang this over your bed. 
  Maybe your father will help you do it. 
  My grandpa will do it. 
  Your grandpa? 
  He helps take care of us. 
  He's lived with us since Well after you put this over your bed, I need you to do something very important. 
  You must'nt, under any circumstances, dream of bunnies tonight. 
  - Bunnies? 
  - That's right. 
  I can't emphasize this enough. 
  You must not dream about soft, furry, cute little bunny rabbits. 
  But how can I not dream about bunnies. 
  I can't control my dreams. 
  Just say to yourself over and over, I will not dream of bunnies, I will not dream of bunnies. 
  Bunnies stay away. 
  I will not dream of bunnies. 
  That's it. 
  I will not dream of bunnies. 
  Now you're getting it, just keep saying that. 
  I will not dream of bunnies. 
  I will not dream of bunnies. 
  Cassie? 
  Jake. 
  Hey, I just wanted to say thank you for helping with the dog. 
  Oh, what's this? 
  They are almond cookies dipped in milk chocolate. 
  They are called harvest moons. 
  Hi, I'm Derrick Sanders. 
  I'm the other half of the Middleton police force. 
  Hello Derrick. 
  Cassie Nightingale. 
  Cookie? 
  Sweet. 
  An old family recipe. 
  Always cooking up something. 
  So how's the shop? 
  Ah, still slow. 
  Even with the ad. 
  Well I should probably get going because you never know when a busload of cosmic seekers might stop by town. 
  Well give it time. 
  People just need to get to know you. 
  Yeah, and I want to get to know them. 
  Enjoy. 
  Cassie. 
  You didn't have to bake cookies. 
  I was more than happy to clear up the little disagreement with the dog. 
  What is with this door. 
  You have a magic touch. 
  Depends what I'm trying to open. 
  Take some of those home for your kids huh. 
  Yeah, I'll hide these from Derrick until I'm off duty. 
  Don't wait too long. 
  Best when they're warm. 
  That's the witch I've been hearing about? 
  She's different. 
  She's different all right. 
  Hi. 
  Hello. 
  Can I help you find something? 
  I'm just looking, - thank you. 
  - Oh, you were with the group. 
  Yeah, - that's right. 
  - I'm Nancy. 
  Nancy Perkins. 
  Cassie Nightingale. 
  Hi, I work just a few doors down at the travel agency. 
  Oh, a pleasure to meet you. 
  Who were those ladies anyway? 
  Business people, mostly, from out of town. 
  Like me. 
  Martha has a vision for Middleton. 
  The town's been struggling ever since the plant closed. 
  So she's a visionary. 
  These are wonderful. 
  Essential oils, flower essences; I'm very much into aroma therapy. 
  This one smells like cinnamon buns? 
  Yeah that's an aphrodisiac. 
  It's my own little mixture. 
  You you're joking? 
  Oh no, you put a few drops on your husband's collar before dinner time and by dessert he's primed and ready to go shall we say. 
  Does I mean, does it really work? 
  Why don't you give it a shot? 
  If it doesn't I'll give you your money back. 
  Oh no, no. 
  I I I don't need it. 
  I'm not suggesting you do. 
  Just consider it a fun little experiment. 
  Oh, uh, okay. 
  Great. 
  - That's five dollars. 
  - Thank you. 
  Now to get the full effect you should put a few drops into some candles and have them burning at the dinner table. 
  Do you have children? 
  No. 
  We tried, but Oh, well, then you won't have to worry about sending them off the grandma's. 
  Let me know how things turn out. 
  I will. 
  Thank you. 
  Martha? 
  Afternoon Nancy. 
  Oh, what have we here? 
  Oh, just a little something for my home. 
  Mrs. Tinsdale, please. 
  Come on in. 
  Excuse me. 
  I was just hearing about your revitalization plans. 
  Middleton's a special place and it attracts a special sort of person. 
  Well thank you. 
  I love it here. 
  This town has a gracious kind of beauty and we work very, very hard to keep it that way. 
  We hold tight to our traditions here in Middleton. 
  Sometimes if you hold on too tight to what you have, - you end up choking it. 
  - Oh. 
  Is there something in particular you're looking for? 
  What are these? 
  Oh, Celtic symbols from the old world. 
  Very fashionable. 
  They look like symbols used in witchcraft. 
  I don't like what I see here Miss Nightingale. 
  It's a magnet. 
  If you touch it to your forehead it aligns your polarities, clarifies your vision. 
  I have an optometrist Miss Nightingale. 
  Now this is said to bring inner peace. 
  (SCREAMING) 
  Mrs. Tinsdale, are you all right? 
  Let go of me! 
  I have had it up to here with your masks! 
  Oh, what brings you home so early? 
  Cookies. 
  Nice. 
  Hey, go ahead. 
  Take two. 
  - Daddy! 
  - Hi honey. 
  Oh! 
  Cookies! 
  Can I have one? 
  You just brushed your teeth. 
  Oh, go ahead. 
  But brush them again after. 
  And you should go to O'Malley's tonight. 
  Come on, you used to love to go down there and sing the old songs Oh, I think I'm just going to head to bed. 
  You feeling all right? 
  Yeah, I'm fine. 
  I'm just a little tired. 
  I'll see you in the morning. 
  - I will not dream of bunnies. 
  - What? 
  I will not dream of bunnies. 
  Okay. 
  Where did you get this? 
  Cassie gave it to me. 
  It's a dream catcher. 
  It catches the bad dreams and only let the good dreams get through. 
  When did you see Miss Nightingale? 
  Today. 
  I went over to the Grey Lady all by myself. 
  She's really nice Dad. 
  Honey you shouldn't bother her. 
  She's got things to do. 
  Okay, good night. 
  Good night daddy. 
  I will not dream of bunnies. 
  Martha? 
  Why aren't you on duty? 
  We changed the schedule. 
  Well I visited her little shop of horrors today and when I politely suggested that some of her merchandise might not be appropriate for Middleton, she pushed me over a display. 
  You can't be serious? 
  I want you to arrest Cassie Nightingale! 
  Walter? 
  Jake. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Mr. 
  Cobb used to build houses. 
  He knows wiring, plumbing, woodwork. 
  He knows it all. 
  He's helping me fix the place up. 
  Well fair exchange for food and a place to stay. 
  Good night folks. 
  He's a godsend. 
  Of course, I believe the right people always show up when you need them most. 
  I didn't recognize him. 
  I almost didn't recognize you without your gun and badge. 
  I'm afraid this isn't a social call. 
  Oh? 
  Cassie, there was an incident today at your shop with Mrs. 
  Tinsdale. 
  She did take a tumble over one of my displays. 
  I hope she's all right. 
  Well it depends on your definition of all right. 
  She wants to file assault charges. 
  Assault? 
  Yes. 
  Cassie, Martha's the Mayor's wife. 
  You know she could cause real trouble for you. 
  So what should I do? 
  Well you might have to come down to the station and make a statement. 
  You might. 
  Until then, try not to worry. 
  Tell me some good news then. 
  Hm. 
  I got home early tonight - with the cookies. 
  - Yeah, what'd they think? 
  Lori was very happy. 
  She liked the cookies too. 
  I'd hide that wine with Walter around. 
  Oh, I'm not worried about Walter. 
  You are very trusting. 
  I'll take that as a compliment. 
  Ah, you need any help? 
  No, I got it. 
  Looks good. 
  Morning, dad. 
  Hey honey, how'd you sleep last night? 
  I didn't hear a sound. 
  What? 
  What's the matter? 
  I dreamed about bunnies all night long. 
  Bunnies? 
  - They were everywhere. 
  - Not monsters? 
  - There were not monsters! 
  - So that's good right? 
  She did it. 
  She really did it. 
  She made the monsters go away. 
  You mean that dream catcher thingy really works? 
  It's true. 
  She's a witch. 
  A real live witch. 
  A witch? 
  But she's a good witch. 
  Okay, get ready for school. 
  No more monsters. 
  Do you know this woman, our new neighbour down the street? 
  Oh yeah. 
  Hey Brandon. 
  How can I help you? 
  You got rid of Lori's monsters. 
  Well I'm glad to hear they're gone, but Lori got rid of them by herself. 
  But you can do magic, right? 
  Well everybody can do magic Brandon. 
  I need something big. 
  What? 
  I need someone turned into a frog. 
  Permanently? 
  At least till the end of the school year. 
  Okay. 
  Well, how about a goat instead. 
  See, contrary to popular belief, it's hard to shrink someone down to the size of a frog. 
  Can you really do that? 
  Who is this person anyway? 
  His name's Kyle. 
  He's a bully. 
  Told anyone? 
  No, - he warned me not to. 
  - I see. 
  So then, this goat/frog thing is flexible as long as he's turned into something less threatening. 
  Yeah, I guess. 
  Well, it's not going to be easy. 
  I'm going to need your help. 
  My help? 
  In order for this to work I need you to do four things. 
  First, you must keep this crystal with you. 
  Second, go to Kyle's home and remain there for at least five minutes, third you have to introduce Kyle to your father, and finally Kyle must touch this crystal and you need to return it to me. 
  How am I supposed to do all that? 
  I don't know. 
  I don't make the rules. 
  I realize it's going to take some courage. 
  Okay. 
  I'll try. 
  I'll be waiting for the crystal. 
  Mr. Mayor, I was just about to call you. 
  Can you charge her? 
  Mr. Mayor, there's not enough evidence to support Martha's allegation. 
  It's her word against Miss Nightingale's. 
  Martha's not going to be too happy to hear this; and when Martha's not happy - I'm not happy. 
  - I can't change the facts. 
  I want you to find out everything you can about this Cassandra Nightingale. 
  The ownership of Grey House has always been murky. 
  Now that developers are interested in the property she arrives one day, out of the blue, with the deed. 
  You don't find that a little suspicious. 
  It's it"s unusual. 
  Jake, this is a critical time for this town. 
  We want Middleton to appeal to new investors; solid business people who pay taxes; taxes to help us meet the city payroll, which includes your salary. 
  Mr. 
  Mayor? 
  No, all I'm asking is that you do a little digging. 
  Aren't you a little curious about her? 
  I am. 
  You got any money? 
  No. 
  Yeah, don't lie to me boy. 
  I don't have any. 
  Yeah, well check your pockets. 
  Come on, empty your pockets. 
  What are you doing here punk? 
  - I - You followed me home. 
  - You're so dead. 
  - I don't want to fight. 
  Go on, you can throw the first punch. 
  What's the matter, you scared? 
  You scared, little chicken? 
  I'm not going to fight you. 
  Then why are you here? 
  I I just thought maybe - we could hang out for a while. 
  - What? 
  Yeah, maybe go inside and play some video games or something? 
  You think I want to hang out with a loser like you? 
  Get lost. 
  What'd I ever do to you? 
  You think my dad ever gave me lunch money? 
  Not once! 
  Spends all his money on booze. 
  Well what about your mom? 
  She ran off when I was six. 
  Why don't we - we could go to my house. 
  - What? 
  I've got video games, some cool ones. 
  You're either the stupidest dweeb I've ever met or you've got some guts after all. 
  Jake, the background check on Miss Nightingale. 
  What'd you find? 
  Searched every possible database and apparently this woman doesn't exist. 
  Local police, State, - FBI - And Interpol. 
  Not even a parking ticket. 
  Birth records, military records. 
  Nothing! 
  Well she has a deed to the house. 
  She claims it was given to her. 
  By who? 
  There's got to be something. 
  Well I did find a Cass Nightingale. 
  She was New Zealand's top female body builder - in 1987. 
  - No, don't think so. 
  Jake, the only thing that we know for sure is that Cassandra Nightingale's name is not Cassandra Nightingale. 
  What about the ad she ran. 
  There's a very good picture of her. 
  This paper's from two weeks ago. 
  So? 
  She still looks the same. 
  I mean, since when did you ever keep a newspaper past noon? 
  Just scan the photo and run it against missing person's database. 
  Look, I got a better idea. 
  Why don't you go over there and talk to her? 
  Oh, gotcha! 
  Hey Brandon? 
  Hey Dad. 
  This is Kyle. 
  A friend of mine from school. 
  Hi Kyle. 
  Hey. 
  Is it all right if he stays for supper? 
  Yeah sure. 
  I should call his parents. 
  No! 
  I'll call. 
  Okay. 
  Might be better if I did. 
  No, he doesn't like us giving out our number. 
  I'll take care of it. 
  Okay. 
  Hey, why don't I order a pizza? 
  Yeah, that'd be great. 
  You know what? 
  You've got a cool dad. 
  Well, how's the pizza boys? 
  Pretty good. 
  Thanks dad. 
  Good. 
  Can I talk to you for a sec? 
  Sure. 
  Is something going on with Kyle? 
  Do you know his parents? 
  - Hey, well if it's nothing - I think I think Kyle's dad is mean to him. 
  Mean to him how? 
  Kyle, he doesn't have a mother either and his dad, he's always screaming at him. 
  He never gets him anything to eat. 
  I think I think he even hurts him. 
  Would he be willing to talk to me? 
  Dad, I don't know. 
  I'll try and convince him. 
  Okay. 
  I'll do something about it, I promise. 
  Thanks dad. 
  All right. 
  Oh, can you tell Cassie you met Kyle? 
  Why? 
  She said you needed to meet him. 
  Nancy. 
  Oh, you look positively glowing. 
  Do you have any more of that oil? 
  - You can't be out already? 
  - No, no, I just I want to make sure I have plenty on hand. 
  Well, yeah. 
  The oil may help a little, but don't downplay your role in it. 
  It is like a second honeymoon and it is so much better than the first. 
  Just promise me you'll give the poor man - a break every now and then. 
  - Oh he's enjoying it too. 
  - Oh, I'm sure he is. 
  - Thank you. 
  Oh, excuse me. 
  - Jake! 
  - Hi. 
  Martha dropped the charges. 
  She had no case. 
  Oh, that's great news isn't it? 
  Thank you Jake, you're a miracle worker. 
  I think you're the one working the miracles. 
  I had a talk with Brandon last night. 
  I think you had something to do with that. 
  I plead the fifth. 
  I know my rights. 
  And Lori is sleeping like like little girls should. 
  That's great news. 
  Who are you? 
  What do you mean? 
  Where are you from? 
  Well, I'm from all over. 
  How far back do you want to go? 
  Were you born - October 24th, 19 - Jake, you don't ask a lady questions like that. 
  Your name's not Cassandra Nightingale is it? 
  It is my name. 
  You're so good at getting everyone else to open up. 
  Why can't you? 
  My parents were performers, traveled all over Europe. 
  It was a magical time. 
  They died in a car crash outside Zurich and I was sent to a foster family back in the US. 
  That must have been hard. 
  They were so strict on me. 
  Killed the magic. 
  So I ran away and I made sure that no one would ever find me again. 
  And you've been running ever since. 
  Not running. 
  Experiencing new places. 
  Like Middleton? 
  Hey, if you like new places, there's this French restaurant, it's on route 20 and no you've been to Europe, you probably think this is Terrific. 
  Yeah? 
  Friday? 
  7? 
  Make it 7:20. 
  7:20? 
  That way I'll pretend it's 7 and I'll be there on time. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay. 
  - Good. 
  - Yeah. 
  All right, thanks. 
  Bye. 
  I mean, see you then. 
  I will not dream of Jake Russell. 
  I will not dream of Jake Russell. 
 
 
 
  She is scaring away every last hope this community has of attracting investors. 
  Her black magic shop is a dagger through the heart of our lovely business district. 
  Now if the police won't do anything about it, then we as citizens must take action. 
  Martha, don't you think you're judging Miss Nightingale just a little harshly. 
  These are the dark arts that she's practicing and selling right under our noses. 
  You know Nancy, perhaps you could better understand the gravity of the situation if you too had children to protect. 
  My own two sons, Dylan and Michael tell me that at school they call her the Witch woman, - and for very good reasons. 
  - Oh, is that true? 
  She makes strange potions. 
  She converse with animals and she has that drunken Walter Cobb living under the same roof with her. 
  Now is this really the sort of thing that we want here in Middleton? 
  No. 
  Good. 
  Then let's show her exactly how we feel. 
  Oh, can I help you? 
  I just wanted to meet the lady who is the talk of my household. 
  I'm George O'Hanrahan. 
  Lori & Brandon's grandfather. 
  Oh, grandpa, it's so nice to meet you. 
  I'm Cassie Nightingale. 
  Hi, I know who you are. 
  Oh George, don't believe everything you hear. 
  The Bell, Book & Candle. 
  Interesting. 
  I think I have something inside that you might like. 
  Oh? 
  A shamrock from the emerald isle. 
  Now how did you know I'm from the old sod? 
  Was it the name O'Hanrahan, or my devilish good looks? 
  Oh, just a lucky guess. 
  My grandfather was a County Claire man. 
  Lived a stone's throw from the cliffs of Moher. 
  I always wanted to stand on those cliffs. 
  Why don't you? 
  Go back to Ireland? 
  No, at first we couldn't afford it, then my little girl Jenny came along and then we really couldn't afford it and then now there's a sensible reason. 
  No George, never do the sensible thing. 
  Getting old. 
  Sure beats the alternative. 
  Do yourself a favor. 
  Hide this away, bring it out again when there's a full moon. 
  A full moon? 
  Yes, that's the time to reconsider your impossible dream. 
  - How much for this? 
  - Oh no. 
  It's a gift. 
  No, I couldn't. 
  Just promise me you'll do it. 
  Thank you. 
  Important City Council Meeting. 
  Please, come voice your concerns at the meeting. 
  Important City council meeting in two weeks sir, please come voice your concerns. 
  Bell, Book & Candle as a black magic store must be closed down. 
  Please, come voice your concerns at the meeting. 
  Have you seen this? 
  You're not going to let the old biddies on the Citizen's Committee do this to Miss Nightingale, are you? 
  Are you? 
  She doesn't deserve this. 
  So you've fallen for her spell too. 
  Nothing of the sort. 
  About dinner; it'll be stew and cabbage. 
  Actually I've got Working again huh? 
  No, I've got a casual dinner thing, just to thank Miss Nightingale for all she's done. 
  What do you think about that? 
  I think it's a grand idea. 
  Thank you very much sir. 
  Thank you. 
  Excuse me, madam, may I have a moment of y our time. 
  Sign the petition. 
  Stop the Bell, Book & Candle. 
  Voice your concerns to City Council on November 1st. 
  I'll be coming. 
  Well, thank you for your time. 
  Thanks. 
  Martha? 
  What are you doing? 
  - Exercising my rights as a citizen. 
  - What about her rights? 
  Well clearly you won't do anything so you leave me no choice. 
  What do you hope to accomplish? 
  Article 237 of the City Ordinance states, and I quote, 'if said business is shown to not be in the best interest of the community, it's license can be revoked'. 
  And who decides that? 
  Concerned citizens of Middleton. 
  Clearly you're not one of them so kindly step aside. 
  Martha, you're obstructing the sidewalk and the entrance to that store. 
  Go ahead, arrest me! 
  Our campaign could use the free publicity. 
  Help! 
  Police brutality! 
  Why didn't you call? 
  Well there's nothing you can do; not this time. 
  Mrs. 
  Tinsdale is a royal pain. 
  Middleton's a lovely place, but I wonder if it's the right place for me. 
  If the community doesn't want me Well the Citizen's League is not the community. 
  Several people have stopped to sign her petition. 
  Which people? 
  You can't let these busybodies run you out of town. 
  They have their reasons for wanting me to go, so I wonder do I have a good reason to stay? 
  Well, there's your home, your business, all the work you've done. 
  You can't leave now. 
  About tonight, I think we should cancel. 
  You're the chief of police, you can't appear to be taking sides. 
  I'm a citizen too. 
  Who works for the mayor. 
  I don't want you losing your job over a thank you dinner. 
  Besides, you've already said thank you to me many times. 
  Cassie I'm going to close up early. 
  Say hi to the kids. 
  Close the Bell, Book & Candle. 
  Sign our petition. 
  Make your views known to city council. 
  Come over here right now. 
  We need you to sign this. 
  As a parent, you must know how important this is. 
  Hello? 
  Could you sign our petition? 
  Please sign our petition. 
  Close the Bell, Book and Candle. 
  Excuse me? 
  Have you signed our petition? 
  Dad? 
  Hey Brandon. 
  Kyle wasn't at school today. 
  I'm worried that something's happened. 
  He's going to be fine. 
  He's with his grandmother in Newton. 
  Is he gonna be okay? 
  He's going to be all right. 
  You did the right thing telling me. 
  Thanks for helping him dad. 
  Sure. 
  Hey, what is this? 
  Cassie gave it to me. 
  It's Irish eyes. 
  I got this old Irish song going through my head. 
  It's driving me nuts. 
  I don't know how to stop it. 
  Well why don't you try listening to some different music. 
  (Song Danny Boy) 
  I don't believe it. 
  Shouldn't you be getting ready? 
  Didn't you have a dinner date? 
  Oh, change of plans. 
  But you're still gonna see her? 
  I don't think so. 
  Look Jake, it's time you moved on with your life. 
  It's time we all did. 
  Well, I just think with everything that's going on in the community - it's just not - Stop making excuses! 
  When there's a full moon over head, tired me Celtic. 
  Tired me Celtic. 
  Walk in the Celtic way. 
  What does that mean? 
  Sometimes you really get my Irish up, you know that? 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Do you still want to go for dinner? 
  - Well I thought we decided - No, I decided that I don't care what people think. 
  Well in that case, won't you come in. 
  I think I have a perfect solution. 
  Why don't we dine in? 
  - Well, I don't want you to have to cook. 
  - Oh, no, I love to cook. 
  Haven't you noticed? 
  I'm always cooking. 
  Look at this. 
  They really treat Walter well. 
  No, Walter is out for the evening. 
  Oh? 
  Oh! 
  Well, I was hoping you might stop by. 
  How could you know? 
  Sometimes you just have to believe and take a chance. 
  You ready to take a chance Jake? 
  I think I already have. 
  Why don't you open the wine and I will get the first course. 
  Sue Ellen Brock. 
  What? 
  You wanted to know my name, the one my parent's gave me. 
  Oh, - so do you want me to call you Sue? 
  - No. 
  Good. 
  You seem more like a Cassandra to me. 
  Definitely a Nightingale. 
  You like to be a mystery don't you? 
  A little mystery deeps things interesting. 
  I'm interested. 
  I know a few facts, but I don't know you that well. 
  I'd like to. 
  Oh, no, no, it's your turn. 
  Tell me something about you that I don't know. 
  Okay, let's see. 
  When I was 13 I broke into the bell tower and replaced the cassette and at noon when chimes were supposed to play, the whole town heard my tape of Led Zeppelin's Whole lot of Love. 
  Oh, I'm telling the police. 
  And after a life of crime, running on the lam, I decided to clean up my act. 
  That's when I decided to bring Jenny and Jenny and the kids here. 
  That was the plan. 
  But plans change. 
  So how did you get here? 
  She brought me here. 
  Jake, I'm the great, great granddaughter and sole surviving heir of Elizabeth Merriwick, the Grey Lady. 
  What's left of her family has finally come home. 
  Through the Grey Lady. 
  When I found out I had property here in Middleton I I took it as a sign to come here and settle down. 
  And since you got here you've had nothing but trouble. 
  Well now, that's not all true. 
  Cassie, the City Council meeting is the day after Halloween. 
  It's really blowing up to be a storm. 
  Oh, but I love storms. 
  Somehow that doesn't surprise me. 
  All right, no more about that. 
  Not tonight. 
  Your perfume is nice. 
  Hm, you noticed. 
  I like it. 
  It worked. 
  You always seem to give people exactly what they need. 
  What do you need? 
  What do I need? 
  A home. 
  You have one. 
  A home is more than a house Jake. 
  I want a place where people will accept me as I am. 
  You'd be surprised how hard that's been for me to find. 
  You're so beautiful. 
  Thank you. 
  (CLOCK CHIMES) 
  Midnight, my favorite time of day. 
  Trick or treat. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you, bye. 
  Do I really have to wear this? 
  You need to get into the spirit of things. 
  Get in touch with your inner child. 
  This inner child is about to have a tantrum. 
  And what about you? 
  I mean, what are you going the wear? 
  Don't you recognize the Grey Lady? 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Oh Trick or Treaters, go wait for it. 
  And remember double treats to anyone brave enough to trick or treat at Grey House. 
  Trick or treat. 
  Why you scallywags, walk you off the plank with the point of sword, feed you to the sharks. 
  They'll crust your bones into powder and use them as cannon fodder. 
  I think that's a little too realistic. 
  Come in, come in. 
  And what are you supposed to be? 
  A witch. 
  She insisted. 
  Don't you know witches aren't very popular around here? 
  I don't care. 
  I want to be a witch when I grow up. 
  Oh, uh, Jake's running a little late. 
  I know who you are? 
  You're the Grey Lady. 
  Yes, and I've come to haunt the party. 
  Ohhhh Did you tell your friends at school? 
  How many do you think will come? 
  I don't think anybody is going to come? 
  Why not? 
  Well, they wanted to but, their parents wouldn't let them. 
  Oh, I see. 
  Well, I hope you're hungry because we have plenty of treats. 
  - Cassie? 
  - Yes Lori. 
  Now that I've gotten rid of the monsters, how do I get rid of the bunnies. 
  I warned you not to dream about them. 
  I couldn't help it. 
  Well the only way to get rid of dream bunnies is to have them chased by dream puppies. 
  Puppies? 
  - Wiggling, face-licking puppies. 
  - Oh no. 
  I will not dream of puppies. 
  I will not dream of puppies. 
  - (KNOCKINNG) 
  - Hm. 
  I'll get it. 
  - Nancy! 
  - I heard there was a party. 
  - Yes, come in. 
  - Thank you. 
  Cassie, this is my husband Bill. 
  - Pleasure to meet you. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  I have some incredible news. 
  I'm pregnant! 
  Oh, that's so wonderful. 
  I still can't believe it. 
  We've been trying for so long. 
  We'd given up hope. 
  I'm so happy for you. 
  I love you. 
  I love you too. 
  Uh, guys. 
  - Party's that way. 
  - Oh, sorry. 
  Honey, why don't you head on in. 
  I'll be right there. 
  - Don't be long. 
  - I'll miss you. 
  Did you have anything to do with this? 
  Well, I've been accused of a lot of things, but not getting someone pregnant. 
  I think maybe your husband was the culprit. 
  Yes, but my doctor was so pessimistic. 
  Oh, well, sometimes it's just a matter of relaxing and letting nature find a way. 
  So it wasn't magic? 
  Oh, it's most definitely magic. 
  Hi George. 
  Here it is, your itinerary for Ireland. 
  It should be quite a trip. 
  To the cliffs of Moher. 
  Tiny question. 
  Why did you insist I book you flight during a full moon? 
  Ah, better runway visibility. 
  This will show her. 
  Come on let's go. 
  That was awesome. 
  (GLASS BREAKING) 
  Hey! 
  Police! 
  Stop! [knocking.] Trick or Treat dweeb. 
  Kyle! 
  You didn't think you could get rid of me that easy. 
  Thought you two might want to catch up. 
  Thanks dad. 
  So where's the party? 
  In here. 
  Everyone, this is my friend Kyle. 
  - Kyle, this is everyone. 
  - Hi. 
  Hey Kyle. 
  Thanks Brandon. 
  Nachos. 
  Hey, sorry I'm late. 
  Where's your costume? 
  Well I'm pretending to be a police chief. 
  I don't think I'm fooling anyone. 
  Here. 
  I don't need this anymore. 
  And cancel the goat. 
  Gotcha. 
  Not the biggest turnout. 
  Oh well, at least it's the people that matter the most. 
  I think we need more candles Jake. 
  - Will you help me? 
  - Sure. 
  Where are they? 
  There should be some on the top shelf. 
  - These do? 
  - Yeah, those are fine. 
  Um something I have to tell you. 
  Thanks to Martha and her minions, with the city council meeting tomorrow, I mean, let's face it, they're going to win. 
  You've got friends. 
  We'll stand up for you. 
  No, that's not enough. 
  So what are you saying? 
  I'll have to close the business. 
  No Cassie. 
  - I don't have a choice. 
  - Well, what will you do? 
  I'll have to sell Grey House. 
  I'm sure the city would make an offer just to get rid of me. 
  No, you said getting that deed was a good sign. 
  Well maybe I misread the sign. 
  I think I have to move on. 
  No. 
  You can't leave. 
  Lori Just use your powers to change their mind. 
  I think you have the wrong idea about me. 
  You're a witch. 
  Lori. 
  Who says I'm a witch? 
  You do magic. 
  I don't want you to go. 
  Well, I don't think I have a choice. 
  You appear out of nowhere and disappear just as fast. 
  Honey I need a moment with Cassie. 
  Thank you. 
  Jake the situation is what it is. 
  I'm just being a realist. 
  You of all people should appreciate that. 
  You've been running so long you don't know how to stop. 
  I want to stop. 
  I want to stay. 
  But I'm afraid. 
  Well you've got to find some of that courage that you've given to so many of us. 
  Jake, it's Derrick. 
  Over. 
  Go ahead Derrick. 
  Cassie's shop's been vandalized. 
  I caught the boys who did it. 
  You better get down here. 
  I'm on my way. 
  Derrick, - Michael and Dylan? 
  - Yeah, I caught them red handed. 
  They did a real job on your shop. 
  Did you call uh ? 
  Oh yeah. 
  I don't believe it. 
  Do you know how much trouble you two are in? 
  You're the one who's going to be in trouble - once my dad gets here. 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh, you poor things. 
  Sweetie! 
  Put in the back of a squad car like common criminals? 
  That's right Martha. 
  Well what are they doing here? 
  They're going to be booked and then they'll go in front of a judge in juvenile court. 
  - You can't do that! 
  - The broke the law. 
  They vandalized Cassie's shop. 
  Tom, do something. 
  Don't let him do this. 
  Surely we can work something out. 
  I'm sorry Mr. 
  Mayor, for you and your boys Jake, stop a minute and think. 
  You know and I know what it means - if you go through with this. 
  - Yeah, I know what this means. 
  I know exactly what it means. 
  Miss Nightingale didn't do anything wrong. 
  Your boys did, because someone put in their heads that everyone in this town needs to act the same and look the same. 
  But Cassie is different and we're all the better for it. 
  Are you going to let him talk to you that way? 
  You don't belong here. 
  Just get on your broomstick and get out! 
  Oh, hey, Derrick, put these two in a cell. 
  They need a little quiet time to think about what they've done wrong. 
  - Tom? 
  - Wait a minute. 
  I'm not pressing charges. 
  You don't have to protect me Cassie. 
  No, it's about the boys. 
  I don't want their lives ruined over this. 
  Just let them go Jake. 
  I've made up my mind. 
  You two boys go wait in my car. 
  Well, none of this would have happened if it weren't for that vile shop of yours. 
  The sooner that we're rid of it the better. 
  Martha! 
  This crazy vendetta of yours has turned our two boys into a couple of juvenile delinquents, and it stops here! 
  Miss Nightingale, I'm equally at fault in all of this. 
  I apologize. 
  My boys are going back to your shop and fix - What? 
  - And fix the damage they've done. 
  Mrs. 
  Tinsdale and I will pay you - for any additional damages. 
  - But Tom Not another word! 
  Thank you. 
  You could be the next mayor. 
  Of course, there is a residency law. 
  You'd have to stick around for a couple of years. 
  I don't want to be the mayor, I just want A real home, with people who love you for who you are, like me. 
  You've cast quite a spell Chief Russell. 
  Does that mean you're staying? 
  (SOUND OF TOOLS) 
  Yeah, that's it. 
  Good job boys. 
  Well see, you have some friends in Middleton after all. 
  How's it going. 
  Well I think these boys have a future in renovation. 
  - I should go in a check out the damage. 
  - Yeah. 
  Hey Brandon? 
  - How's it going, Dad? 
  - Good. 
  Well, it doesn't look so bad. 
  Oh Jake, don't handle broken glass. 
  Right, you're the that broom? 
  How did that get here? 
  Somebody must have brought it. 
  No, no, the door was locked and you haven't been here since so I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation. 
  Sure looks like a witch's broom. 
  What are you implying? 
  You're not a witch are you? 
  Silly.
