 - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Derek? 
  I'm just doing a little window shopping. 
  I'll be back in around 20. 
  No rush, Chief. 
  There's not much going on. 
  What about a blue cashmere scarf, Derek? 
  Oh, thanks, Chief! 
  But won't it clash with my uniform? 
  For Cassie. 
  Otherwise I pretty much have my Christmas shopping done. 
  What about jewellery, Derek? 
  I mean, Cassie's tastes aren't exactly traditional. 
  Ah, you're right. 
  What do you get a woman who can conjure up anything? 
  Hmm. 
  Derek, I think I see someone. 
  I'll catch you later. 
  10-4. 
  Chief Russell! 
  Hello, sweetheart. 
  Hi. 
  Hi, you looking for someone? 
  I thought I saw someone who I knew, but Well, this is the season to reach out to old friends. 
  Aren't you cold? 
  Oh, no, I just came out to check my window display. 
  Doesn't that make you want to step inside? 
  - When did you get the automatic doors? 
  - I didn't. 
  Hey. 
  Can you do that in uniform? 
  I'm the chief, I can do whatever I want. 
  In that case, do it again. 
  I've decided. 
  The wedding should be in April. 
  Hmm April can be very unpredictable. 
  - So can you. 
  - Hmm, I suppose. 
  But when it comes to Christmas, I can be very traditional. 
  Oh, I love the season. 
  Can't say the same for everybody in my house. 
  Oh? 
  You know, Christmas really hasn't been the same since Jenny passed away. 
  Yeah, they miss their mom. 
  I got my Christmas shopping done. 
  Except for you. 
  I have the only gift I need. 
  You're my bride to be, this has to be the perfect gift. 
  What's this? 
  An astrological calendar. 
  For this year. 
  There's two weeks left. 
  People have a lot to do in these two weeks. 
  Tell me about it. 
  Why don't you keep it? 
  Jake, it's not your only gift, just think of it as a stocking stuffer. 
  Thank you. 
  So? 
  Any luck? 
  Oh, no, but I should have a positive ID any minute now if it's who I think it is. 
  No, I meant did you find something for Cassie? 
  Oh, no, not yet. 
  It's gotta be the best Christmas gift ever. 
  Well, yeah, she is your fiancée. 
  It's not that, Derek, it's Cassie spent a lot of sad Christmas mornings at that foster home. 
  Maybe when you two finally pick a wedding date next year will be a little different. 
  We've been trying to pick a wedding date for months. 
  Give me this. 
  Jake, how are you going to find a wedding date next year? 
  This is this year's calendar. 
  Leon Deeks. 
  What? 
  Leon Deeks. 
  In a message from State Prison, "Leon Deeks was released from federal prison two days ago". 
  I knew that's who I saw. 
  Served 10 years out of a 15 year sentence. 
  How do you know this guy? 
  Do you remember the Shelbyville National Bank robbery? 
  - I remember hearing about it. 
  - He was the robber. 
  What do you think he's doing here? 
  I think he's either here to visit his ex-wife and daughter who still live in Middleton, or Or what? 
  After the robbery, I was the one who arrested him and sent him to prison. 
  Whoa. 
  "Whoa" is right. 
  Let's take a drive through town. 
  See if he's still window shopping. 
  How much did Deeks walk away with? 
  $100,000. 
  Still missing. 
  Are you alright? 
  That wind, it just loves to open and close my door. 
  - Who are you? 
  - I'm Cassie Nightingale. 
  The proprietor. 
  Welcome. 
  So, uh, you did all this? 
  Excuse me? 
  All this work. 
  It's so broken down. 
  Oh, yeah, I suppose it was pretty run down. 
  I was just glad I was able to give it a second chance. 
  I love second chances, don't you? 
  I don't know. 
  I'm still waiting for my first. 
  - Are you from around here? 
  - I used to be. 
  Then maybe you know my fiancé, Jake Russell? 
  Yeah, Chief Russell. 
  Yeah, we go way back. 
  Are you hunting for anything in particular? 
  - Huh? 
  - In the shop? 
  Uh, what's that back there? 
  Feathers? 
  Peacock feathers. 
  Just got them in. 
  I'll just be a minute, they're still in the box. 
  Feel free to look around! 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Merry Christmas, over there! 
  Here we go Merry Christmas. 
  Well, look who's finally decided to emerge from his room! 
  Hey, Grandpa. 
  Tinsel or no tinsel this year? 
  You decide. 
  You you're going to help me decorate, aren't you? 
  Uh, no, I'm headed out to a movie with my friend. 
  We'll be grabbing pizza later. 
  - I guess your dad knows? 
  - Of course. 
  I'm outta here. 
  Back before 10:00. 
  - See ya. 
  - Well, Lori, looks like it's you and me tonight. 
  Dad's going out with Cassie, so How about you and I stir up a batch of Christmas cookies? 
  Christmas cookies? 
  You know the little round ones you like with the powdered sugar? 
  Sorry, I'm going to a sleepover with Amy. 
  - Didn't Dad tell you? 
  - Oh no. 
  No, he didn't. 
  Oh, there's my ride. 
  Later! 
  Resolved that Betty will repaint her business sign out by the highway. 
  What? 
  Passed! 
  But I need that sign for my bakery to do business! 
  Uh-uh, ASAP, Betty. 
  We want the holiday shoppers visiting town to feel good about Middleton. 
  It's all about the gracious, traditional image that we want to project. 
  But your slogan? 
  "Turn left for the best sticky buns in the state!" - Ugh! 
  - Well, they are It's just so tacky. 
  After all, Middleton is not a truck stop! 
  So, if there is no further business, everyone have a very merry Christmas, the happiest of holidays, etcetera, etcetera, and so forth. 
  This session of the Middleton Citizen's League is hereby adjourned! 
  Whoo! 
  Have you thought about my proposal? 
  About Cassie Nightingale? 
  Inviting her to join the Citizen's League? 
  Oh, my dear Gwen. 
  I thought you were joking! 
  Oh, Martha? 
  Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor. 
  - Gwen. 
  - Hello, dear. 
  I love my new gavel! 
  A little present to myself. 
  Martha, walk with me a minute. 
  Oh, well, you'll have to walk quickly. 
  I'm late for my mani-pedi. 
  Martha, this isn't easy for me to say. 
  I just finished talking with our business manager. 
  - It's about our real estate investments. 
  - What about them? 
  They failed. 
  What do you mean? 
  We've lost everything. 
  - Not the Orlando condo? 
  - Everything. 
  Martha, we're broke. 
  All our money is gone. 
  How can that be? 
  We're not destitute. 
  I still have my mayor's salary, our house. 
  But there will have to be some changes. 
  Oh, Tom You know how I hate changes! 
  Well, for a start you have to get a job. 
  A jo - What about the Citizen's League? 
  - A paying job. 
  Until we get back on our feet. 
  I don't understand! 
  How could this have happened? 
  What's happened to a lot of people. 
  We'll pull through. 
  And we'll talk more tonight, okay? 
  Oh, and Martha? 
  Until further notice, please do your own nails. 
  I wonder if we're going to get a white Christmas this year. 
  - I hope not. 
  - How come? 
  I mean, why waste a perfectly good snow day when we're going to be off school anyway? 
  Think the stores will be open after the movie? 
  Maybe. 
  I want to get my mom something different this year. 
  Any ideas? 
  A snow shovel? 
  Hello, Jake. 
  - Hi, honey. 
  - Hi. 
  What a nice surprise. 
  Well, speaking of surprises, - I've got one for you. 
  - Hmm! 
  - Have a seat. 
  - Okay. 
  I got your Christmas gift. 
  Jake, I already told you, you don't have to give me anything. 
  No, you gave me this calendar, and I've been looking at it, and I decided one gift deserves another. 
  So this is the most exciting gift that I can imagine. 
  Well, I could do with a little excitement. 
  My bed and breakfast gets very quiet over the holidays. 
  Cassie I want to give you a family for Christmas. 
  What do you mean? 
  I mean let's get married. 
  I think I already said yes. 
  No, I mean now. 
  Jake Russell, when did you get so spontaneous? 
  The day that I decided you were the one for me. 
  Oh, maybe my personality is rubbing off on you. 
  Come on, we've been trying to set a date for this wedding for months and something always gets in the way. 
  What was the excuse last time? 
  Mercury in retrograde. 
  Okay, well, the calendar that you gave me says "This is the perfect time to forge new partnerships and initiate long-term plans". 
  Does it really say all that? 
  Hmm Jake, Christmas is only seven days away. 
  Not on Christmas. 
  On Christmas Eve. 
  Pull a wedding together in six days? 
  We'll get everybody to chip in. 
  Oh, so little time, so much fun. 
  Cassie, I want you to wake up Christmas morning with the family you've always wanted. 
  We're going to put the magic back in Christmas for you and the kids and George, and on Christmas morning we'll wake up one, big, happy family. 
  We have some news. 
  We finally set a date for the wedding! 
  When is it going to be? 
  Christmas Eve. 
  - That's great! 
  - That's um Yeah, six days, I know. 
  Is it going to be at Grey House? 
  I would think Grey House is going to be a little too cozy for our guests. 
  We wouldn't want to leave anyone out. 
  Uh can you get it together that fast? 
  We're going to need everyone's help. 
  Starting right now. 
  Who wants to help me do some baking? 
  I do! 
  How 'bout you, George? 
  Uh, I'm feeling a little tired. 
  I think I'll take a nap. 
  It's going to be a perfect wedding. 
  - Yeah. 
  - A magical wedding. 
  Come on! 
  I'm afraid we might need more than magic. 
  I think we may need a miracle. 
  Hmm, well, fortunately this is the season of miracles. 
  Thank you. 
  No, I tried to object, Gwen. 
  Martha can't tell me what to paint on my own sign. 
  Well, I'm just about I'm going to call you back later. 
  Hello, Martha. 
  - Coffee? 
  - Actually, that's not why I'm here. 
  Martha, I told you I just can't afford to re-paint my sign. 
  Whatever you think best. 
  Um okay. 
  Then what can I do for you? 
  Betty I've decided to take a more hands-on approach to helping our community. 
  How do you mean? 
  Well, I thought I could start right here. 
  Perhaps as a hostess, welcoming people as they enter. 
  Are you asking me for a job? 
  In a manner of speaking. 
  I simply thought that with the holidays, you might use a little assistance. 
  You know, I might have an opening. 
  Why don't you just let me talk to Marty in the kitchen. 
  In the kitchen? 
  Oh, no, no, no! 
  I thought something perhaps that would showcase my people skills! 
  Such as a hostess! 
  Leon Deeks was about to rob that cash register until my wife threw her hip into it. 
  Martha stopped a robbery with her hips? 
  I hope you're not joking, Deputy, because this is no laughing matter. 
  I'm aware that Leon Deeks is back in Middleton, Mayor Tinsdale. 
  What are you doing about it? 
  Well, first of all, we're going to have to talk with all the business owners in Middleton. 
  We do not want a repeat of that Shelbyville Bank job 10 years ago. 
  No, sir, we do not. 
  That's why I'm keeping my eye on him. 
  24/7, Jake. 
  This town is flush with holiday cash. 
  For the next week, Leon Deeks is your one and only priority. 
  A DJ for the reception? 
  What sort of music? 
  All sorts! 
  Yeah, that's right, and any Christmas carols you can dance to. 
  Thank you! 
  Ah, dried sage, sprinkled sea salt spirit stones Hello, Derek. 
  You working on a potion? 
  No, making a list for the ceremony. 
  Well, just here on orders from the chief. 
  Going up and down the block. 
  Making sure that all the shop keepers are being extra careful. 
  Hmm, is there cause for alarm? 
  No, just better to be safe than sorry. 
  Plus, it gets me out of the office. 
  And you can do your Christmas shopping. 
  Yeah. 
  Is there someone special you're buying for this year? 
  A young lady, perhaps? 
  I wish. 
  You do? 
  Hmm How can I help you with that? 
  Got a sister? 
  No, I'm afraid I don't. 
  Well, maybe I'll write a letter to Santa. 
  Now, that's the spirit. 
  Oh, and Derek, don't forget my pie plates. 
  I need them back. 
  So I can cook you up something new. 
  Right. 
  There you are! 
  Come help me decorate the tree. 
  Mom, why did you waste your money on that thing? 
  Because it's Christmas. 
  Why don't you put the star on top? 
  Remember that? 
  How could I forget? 
  You made that when you were five years old. 
  With a lot of love. 
  Life was pretty nice back then. 
  A long time ago. 
  Sweetie Merry Christmas, Ruth. 
  Leon Dad? 
  How you doing, angel? 
  You're so big. 
  Last time I saw you You were sentenced to 15 years? 
  Why are you here? 
  Well, I'm out. 
  Got five years off for good behaviour. 
  Why are you here? 
  Why not? 
  We're family, right? 
  We were. 
  Look, Ruth, that was a low blow sending me divorce papers while I was stuck in the pen. 
  But I forgive you. 
  You forgive me? 
  Yeah. 
  And to prove it, I'm going to make this the biggest, best Christmas our little girl ever had. 
  Jodi, if you could have anything, anything at all what would it be? 
  I I don't know. 
  Keep thinking about it cause I'm getting it for you. 
  No. 
  You are out of my life, and I am going to make sure you stay out of Jodi's - if I have to take you to court to do it. 
  - Mom! 
  - Hey, she's my daughter, too, alright? 
  - No. 
  Get out. 
  At least let the kid decide for herself. 
  Get out and don't you ever come back. 
  Oh, which of these invitations do you prefer? 
  Uh, which one do you like? 
  - That one. 
  - Me, too. 
  Good. 
  And I have to run to the florist. 
  There's been a run on poinsettias, but I think I can swing it. 
  We have a bigger problem than that. 
  I know, the golf course and the VFW turned us down. 
  Cause they were both nine months in advance. 
  But I think it'll all work out in the end. 
  Cassie, it's not about the venue. 
  It's about the marriage license. 
  They have new I. 
  D. 
  requirements, and some of your records don't exist. 
  Yes, I suppose I have had a chequered past. 
  Well, I'm looking for the court documents, but six days till Christmas and with people gone for the holidays What are you saying? 
  I'm saying that unless we can prove that you're Cassandra Nightingale We might have to postpone the wedding. 
  Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas. 
  Thank you very much. 
  Have you got all your Christmas shopping done? 
  - Hello, Merry Christmas! 
  - Hi! 
  Hello, Betty. 
  Can I help you? 
  Um, I'm just looking. 
  Let me know if you need anything. 
  Okay. 
  What are you doing? 
  People come into the store so stressed this time of year, a little incense helps lighten the energy. 
  Hmm. 
  You know what? 
  It smells really familiar. 
  Almost smells like Like what? 
  Like my apple ginger pie. 
  Mmm. 
  How is that even possible? 
  Oh, you'd be surprised at what's possible. 
  Hmm. 
  You know, I'm a big fan of that pie of yours and about a dozen other things on your menu. 
  I was wondering if if you could cater my wedding. 
  When is your big day? 
  Uh, Christmas Eve? 
  That's a tall order. 
  But I'd love to. 
  Oh, I know how busy you are this time of year. 
  Yeah, this season it's always rush, rush, rush. 
  Right up until Christmas finally arrives and I can go home and relax in my easy chair all day. 
  Alone. 
  Oh, wow! 
  God that sparkles! 
  Oh yeah, I placed that there to take advantage of the light. 
  Try it on. 
  Me? 
  Oh, no, I I'm not really the type to wear jewellery. 
  Are you sure? 
  You know, I should probably get back to the bake shop. 
  Okay. 
  Merry Christmas, Martha. 
  What? 
  Oh, yes, I suppose it is. 
  Oh, and be sure to send me your wedding menu as soon as you can. 
  I will. 
  Hello, Martha. 
  Miss Nightingale I have been in and out of every shop on this street. 
  Oh, and not one bag to show for it! 
  Oh, I haven't been buying, I've been I've been so busy. 
  With the Citizen's League and the Christmas Decorating Committee and of course the Heritage Society, although, thank goodness that's winding down now for the holidays. 
  Well, you know, I've been busy, too. 
  I guess you heard the good news. 
  - The wedding. 
  Congratulations! 
  - Yeah. 
  Thank you. 
  I hope you can make it, I know it's very last minute. 
  And Christmas Eve. 
  The Mayor and I have several long standing social obligations. 
  You understand. 
  Well, it would mean a lot to me if you could be there. 
  You really know how to make a party come alive, Martha. 
  I do? 
  Yes, I suppose I do. 
  Huh. 
  Make a party. 
  So can I count you in, then? 
  Leon! 
  Jake Russell. 
  What, no backup? 
  Tough guy. 
  Can I talk to you? 
  Yeah, go ahead talk. 
  What are you doing in Middleton? 
  I'm visiting my family. 
  You remember? 
  The ones who have been without a husband and a father for the past 10 years? 
  - Thanks to you. 
  - I didn't rob a bank. 
  Still haven't found the money. 
  I told them where I hid that money. 
  It's in a warehouse in Shelbyville. 
  - Wasn't there. 
  - No? 
  It's not really the money that's bothering you, is it, Chief? 
  What's bothering you is the family you destroyed. 
  My family. 
  You did that on your own, Leon. 
  I was doing my duty. 
  Don't give me a reason to send you back there again. 
  Yeah, don't worry about me, Jake. 
  Worry about yourself. 
  Oh, thank you! 
  Mom's been kind of wired lately. 
  Maybe something to help her, you know chill. 
  Spa in a box. 
  Lavender bath oils, relaxing facial, and magnetic stones to place on her pressure points. 
  I've got it! 
  I've got it! 
  Got what, Martha? 
  The Christmas spirit? 
  No, no, no, no! 
  My new career. 
  I'm going to be a personal wedding planner, and you are my very first client. 
  Well, that is very thoughtful of you, Martha. 
  I'll handle it all. 
  Music, menu, colour scheme theme! 
  From your, wait for it, 12 drummers drumming, to your partridge in a pear tree. 
  That sounds like you have some very big plans. 
  They have to be big! 
  I expect potential clients to take notice and hire me for future events! 
  Now, for the seven swans a-swimming, I was thinking ice sculptures! 
  You know, I don't want to dampen your enthusiasm, - but how much is this going to cost? 
  - Not a penny. 
  I intend on working gratis. 
  It's only fair. 
  It is my vision, after all. 
  Well, I have a vision, too. 
  So maybe we could have a meeting of the minds. 
  Well, then, you need to make some decisions immediately! 
  Luckily, I brought swatches. 
  By the way, I would keep my eye on her if I were you. 
  I believe she's Leon Deeks' daughter. 
  If you know what I mean. 
  Hey, guys! 
  Hi, Lori! 
  Cassie Dad wants you to sign these so he can get the marriage license. 
  Something about permission to search for your birth records? 
  Getting married sure is complicated. 
  It takes so many people to make it all come together. 
  Lori, would you look after this? 
  This is the ring your father's going to give me in the ceremony. 
  It belonged to my mother. 
  It's beautiful. 
  Yeah, it's one of the few things I have of my mother's. 
  So I need you to take very good care of it until the wedding. 
  You can count on me. 
  Oh, in that case, would you watch the store for one minute? 
  I've got to run down and pick up my wedding dress. 
  Dress? 
  Oh, it has to be white! 
  It can't be off-white! 
  We can't have you clashing with the ice sculptures! 
  Okay! 
  She acts like she's the one getting married. 
  Okay. 
  I think my mom's really going to like this. 
  Speaking of gifts, what are we going to get Cassie for Christmas? 
  I don't know. 
  She's so amazing, the gift has to be amazing, too. 
  Yeah. 
  Hey, Jodi, any ideas for my new step-mom? 
  Where'd she go? 
  She must have stepped out. 
  Brandon, where's the ring?! 
  Beats me. 
  I left it right here on the counter! 
  It's gotta be here someplace, okay? 
  Where? 
  It couldn't just disappear! 
  Lori We've got to find it. 
  What are we going to tell Cassie? 
  We're not going to tell Cassie! 
  She's got enough on her mind. 
  Just keep looking! 
  Oh! 
  Hi, Brandon! 
  Hi, Jodi. 
  Lori, what are you doing here? 
  I was just, uh going for a walk. 
  You guys been shopping? 
  Yeah, I got my mom that spa in the box. 
  I was all set to buy it when I saw her outside the shop. 
  So I cleared out fast. 
  Better go hide this under my bed. 
  Bye, Brandon. 
  I know why you're here. 
  You came over to accuse Jodi of taking the ring. 
  No! 
  Thought maybe she stole it, right? 
  Because of who her dad is? 
  Lori, I want to find it, too - Brandon, I You're as bad as Martha Tinsdale! 
  What's wrong, honey? 
  What do you mean? 
  Well, for one thing, you haven't complained once about doing all this Christmas shopping with me. 
  - I got a lot of things on my mind. 
  - The wedding. 
  That and what happens after. 
  I'm moving out. 
  To make room for the newlyweds. 
  George, you're such a romantic. 
  That's why I fell for you. 
  This is your chance to start a new life. 
  Ask yourself, "What does George O'Hanrahan want?" More than anything? 
  To put these packages down. 
  My arms are killing me. 
  Well, why don't you lug them to my place? 
  - And I'll put on a pot of coffee? 
  - You're on. 
  Let's get this stuff under the tree. 
  I don't have a tree. 
  You know I'm leaving for San Diego tomorrow. 
  You had to remind me. 
  - You don't want me to go? 
  - That's not what I meant. 
  I know how important this trip is to you, Gwen. 
  Well, you're important to me, too, George. 
  You know that. 
  It's just It wouldn't be Christmas without my grandchildren. 
  You understand. 
  I do, I really do. 
  I love Christmas with my grandkids. 
  Then what are you saying? 
  I'm going to miss you, Gwen. 
  Oh, I'm going to miss you, too. 
  But I'll be back before you can blink. 
  Just in time for a happy new year. 
  - Merry Christmas! 
  - Merry Christmas, thank you very much. 
  Dad? 
  Lori! 
  - Honey, have you got a problem? 
  - Yeah. 
  Brandon. 
  Brandon? 
  - What's wrong? 
  - Well, I lost Cassie's wedding ring. 
  - You you did? 
  - And I think Brandon's friend Jodi knows where it is. 
  Why would she know? 
  Because she was right next to it when it disappeared! 
  And I never said she stole it! 
  I just wanted to talk to her about it. 
  But now Brandon acts like I hate her or something! 
  And I don't hate her, but What if she does have the ring? 
  I need to get it back! 
  Alright, what did Cassie say? 
  Well, you can't tell Cassie! 
  Alright. 
  Well, I'll, uh I'll talk to Brandon. 
  Well, maybe he'll listen to you. 
  He sure doesn't listen to me. 
  Alright, it's going to be okay. 
  You go home, okay? 
  Your dad's got work to do. 
  Do you think we'll find it? 
  Oh, we'll give it our best shot. 
  - It's a steal. 
  - What? 
  The scented shaving soap. 
  It's only $4. 
  99. 
  That is what you were looking at, wasn't it? 
  Uh, yeah, yeah. 
  Here, take a whiff. 
  That's not bad. 
  Sandalwood. 
  Very popular with family men. 
  The women in their lives just love it. 
  Oh, that's not for sale. 
  It's for the Santa who rings the bell outside my shop. 
  I don't see him. 
  Where is he now? 
  Carl's got a touch of the flu. 
  Children's fund is going to miss out on all those donations. 
  Yeah, well, things are tough all over. 
  I'm surprised you never noticed Santa before. 
  Especially since you spend so much time in this part of town. 
  I've been out and around window shopping. 
  Got a lot of time on my hands these days. 
  You know, with all that extra time, why don't you make good use of it? 
  All the kids will love you. 
  You gotta be kidding It'll be a wonderful way to show people you care. 
  And since you'd be right outside, you can pop in anytime and warm up with a cup of my mulled cider. 
  I wonder if it fits. 
  Looking at you, I would say it's a perfect fit. 
  Brandon, may I have a word with you, please? 
  Soon as I finish this level. 
  Hey. 
  I was just about to show Brandon how to make a customized Christmas ornament for Jodi. 
  Well, I'd just like to have a word with him before the two of you get started. 
  Hmm. 
  Alone. 
  Ah. 
  You want the old man to take a hike. 
  It's what I need, a hike. 
  Why are you angry with your sister? 
  Cause she accused Jodi of being a thief! 
  According to Lori, she never said a word to Jodi. 
  She was going to. 
  I guess Lori thinks that just because Jodi's dad robbed a bank it runs in the family. 
  Well, Lori's very upset. 
  About the ring and you. 
  And Brandon, Jodi was right beside that ring when it disappeared. 
  You know, the whole town's against her. 
  They think she's some sort of gangster. 
  I expect this from Martha Tinsdale. 
  Not from my own father. 
  Brandon. 
  - Later. 
  - Hey, Brandon Hi. 
  Hi, uh maybe this isn't the best time. 
  No, there's no time like the present. 
  Alright, well, uh I have the flow of the ceremony. 
  I have to get a copy of this to the minister, except Except what? 
  Well, I'm having trouble finding one. 
  Sometimes I wonder if all of this is going to work out. 
  Oh, it will. 
  Trust me! 
  We'll find a minister and a venue, and we'll get our license. 
  No, not that, Cassie. 
  I got Brandon mad at me, he's fighting with his sister. 
  Lori's upset. 
  And George he's feeling like he just wants to get away from us all. 
  I just want to give everyone a family Christmas. 
  It's hard to have a family Christmas when you don't have a happy family to celebrate it. 
  Hi, thank you. 
  Oh, wow, so many gifts! 
  Well, it is a wedding shower, right? 
  Betty, I just, I can't thank you enough. 
  Oh. 
  Wait till you try your wedding cake. 
  Oh, that reminds me! 
  You're going to have to sample some of that sparkling wine before I order it. 
  Betty, um Every woman deserves a little sparkle in her life. 
  I want you to have this. 
  A gift? 
  Cassie, I couldn't Oh, look at all those gifts. 
  You deserve one, too. 
  It is pretty, but It's not really my style. 
  Well, I'll tell you what. 
  Try it for a few days, and if you don't like it, I'll exchange it. 
  You don't have to do that. 
  Customer satisfaction is my priority. 
  If you insist. 
  - I'll go get the wine. 
  - Okay. 
  Yoo-hoo! 
  Season's greetings! 
  Oh, well, fashionably late, as usual. 
  - Martha, you shouldn't have. 
  - What? 
  I didn't. 
  Your gift is on back order. 
  Voilà! 
  Partridges in a pear tree! 
  Wow. 
  Do we need that? 
  Oh, we need several of them. 
  One for each table. 
  Oh, even the menu isn't that grand, Martha. 
  Yeah, Betty's right. 
  I ordered comfort food. 
  Oh, wedding's aren't about comfort, for goodness sake. 
  If they were, people would be getting married all the time. 
  Oh, I ordered your cake. 
  Five tiers! 
  Oh, uh Betty's doing the cake. 
  Oh! 
  Really? 
  What kind? 
  Well, we decided perhaps a yellow sheet cake. 
  Sheet cake? 
  Oh, my dear Betty. 
  Cassie's cake has to be at least as tall as the pear trees. 
  Am I right? 
  Why don't we let Betty do the cake? 
  I see. 
  Well, it's your funeral. 
  Oops, I mean wedding. 
  Martha, I so appreciate all you've done. 
  Do you? 
  Do any of you? 
  I had a vision. 
  Nine ladies dancing, eight lords a-leaping, and Well, a sheet cake would just compromise the entire affair. 
  I mean, who would hire me after that got around? 
  Nope, I'm afraid that I am going to have to bow out. 
  I'm sorry to hear that, Martha. 
  Well, I couldn't have attended anyway. 
  I have a previous engagement! 
  Ho, ho, ho. 
  Ooh, you're feeling jolly as well, huh? 
  How can we have a Merry Christmas if everyone's so miserable? 
  Everybody? 
  - Well, my family anyway. 
  - Hmm. 
  Including you? 
  Guess so. 
  Why? 
  Because I don't have the A dress. 
  For the wedding. 
  The one I wanted was too small. 
  Well, why don't we have it let out? 
  We're all constantly growing. 
  Aren't we, Lori? 
  Yeah, what's the rate on that room? 
  That much? 
  Um Nothing lower? 
  I thought for some reason, um, rooms would be lower in Montreal. 
  I guess not. 
  Thanks. 
  Brandon. 
  I didn't hear you come in. 
  Montreal? 
  Yeah, um, a friend of mine has a restaurant up there. 
  Cool. 
  I thought I'd go for For a visit. 
  A long visit. 
  - Hello? 
  - Mrs. 
  Deeks, hi, I'm Cassie Nightingale. 
  - We spoke on the phone? 
  - Of course, please come in. 
  Thanks. 
  Rumour has it you're the best seamstress in all of Middleton. 
  Thank you. 
  I have a little emergency. 
  Uh Can you let this out two inches? 
  It's a very delicate material. 
  - Is there enough fabric? 
  - Let me see. 
  - Yes, I can do it. 
  - Oh, you're a life saver! 
  Listen, I know you have this colour thread upstairs. 
  If you want to wait, it'll only take a few minutes. 
  - Perfect! 
  - Please make yourself at home. 
  Thanks. 
  Dad? 
  Sorry, I heard voices and thought No, it's just me. 
  Your mom's fixing a dress for me. 
  She is going to love that spa in a box. 
  Oh, yes! 
  You know what? 
  I forgot to give you something the other day. 
  A coin? 
  It's a gift. 
  A dollar. 
  - Thanks. 
  - It's a silver dollar. 
  Is it worth more than a regular dollar? 
  Well, that depends on how you spend it. 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Merry Christmas, Middleton! 
  Merry Christmas. 
  Ho, ho, ho oh! 
  That's the spirit. 
  And a prosperous new year to you. 
  And to all of us. 
  It's only two days till Christmas, and I still don't know what to get you. 
  That's okay. 
  I was going to make you this Christmas ornament, but pretty lame, huh? 
  Brandon I'm sure I'd like just about anything if it came from you. 
  Yeah, but What do you really want? 
  I, uh don't think there's much chance I'll get what I really want for Christmas. 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Happy holidays to you! 
  Oh, thank you. 
  Got any change? 
  Just this. 
  Oh, nice coin. 
  What's it worth? 
  A dollar? 
  Maybe it's worth something. 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe it'll make somebody have a better Christmas than me. 
  Merry Christmas, Santa. 
  Jodi? 
  Mommy, there's Santa! 
  Can we please say hi to Santa? 
  What a sweet family. 
  Merry Christmas, Santa. 
  Merry Christmas! 
  Thanks, Santa. 
  See ya. 
  - Bye, Santa! 
  - Merry Christmas. 
  Merry Christmas. 
  Yes, I'm making truffles for the wedding guests. 
  So if you could just double that order Yes, I know it is a lot of chocolate but as I always say, you can never have too much love or chocolate. 
  Oh, thank you so much. 
  Hello, Derek. 
  - Hi. 
  - Keeping our streets safe? 
  Thanks to you. 
  Getting Leon in a Santa suit? 
  How did you manage to do that? 
  Never underestimate the magic of Santa. 
  - I have your pie plates. 
  - Oh, - how'd you like the mince pie? 
  - Loved it. 
  Well, I'm ready for my next treat. 
  Evening, ma'am. 
  Oh, Deputy, it's me. 
  Betty. 
  Betty! 
  Listen, I wanted to ask you about your cake. 
  Which frosting? 
  Beautiful. 
  Oh, yes, it's going to be beautiful. 
  But I want to know which flavour. 
  No, I meant you! 
  Oh, well thank you! 
  You know, after a day of wearing this necklace, I just had to go buy a new dress to go with it. 
  And then I had to buy new shoes to go with the new dress, and then I got a new haircut to match my new outfit, and before I knew it, I had a total make-over. 
  It's amazing how this little necklace inspired a whole new me. 
  Not new. 
  The outer sparkle just helped your inner sparkle shine through. 
  I'll say. 
  I'll say chocolate frosting. 
  Not that it's my cake, but, you know, I'm sure whatever cake you make is is going to be great. 
  Thank you, Derek. 
  Um I'm going to go back to my bake shop. 
  I'll, uh, I'll walk you. 
  Okay. 
  Say, what are you doing Christmas Day? 
  Cassie, you're really doing a good job on those. 
  Thank you. 
  Mmm, thanks. 
 
 
 
  I got our wedding license. 
  What?! 
  That's terrific! 
  Really? 
  - How? 
  - I just told the county clerk that you'd been paying state and federal taxes under the name Cassandra Nightingale for years and that if it was good enough for the Internal Revenue Service then who were they to say otherwise? 
  Brilliant! 
  We're on a roll! 
  Now all we have to do is figure out a place to have the wedding. 
  Well, what happened to the garden club? 
  Well, they won't let us use their solarium for the wedding. 
  Something about the body heat from the guests wilting the lilies. 
  That's ridiculous! 
  Well, they've got a point. 
  You and I have a way of raising the temperature all by ourselves. 
  Jake lighten up! 
  Sorry, it's just It's Christmas. 
  Everything's either booked or closed for the holidays. 
  Well, not to worry. 
  I have a plan. 
  Yeah, you always do. 
  I also have our minister. 
  He's happy to drive down from Lakeville. 
  Apparently he and George go way back. 
  Yeah, George He's talking about moving. 
  To Montreal. 
  He's got a friend that owns a restaurant there. 
  What? 
  But You and the kids have to get together and figure out a way to talk him out of it. 
  Cassie, we're not even talking. 
  Well, I've got to get back to work. 
  Why don't you stop for a cup of coffee on your way to keep warm? 
  What? 
  What's that smile about? 
  I just remembered that I'm marrying you on Christmas Eve. 
  Just a coffee, please. 
  Betty! 
  Just the usual, Chief Russell? 
  Yes. 
  The, uh Okay. 
  Well. 
  Is this seat taken? 
  It is now, I guess. 
  Brandon You can't still be mad at me. 
  Why not? 
  You still think Jodi's a thief. 
  I never said that. 
  It's tough on Jodi. 
  She has such a big heart. 
  She hides it cause she has this rep around school. 
  All because her dad was in prison. 
  You know, I was beginning to think that you were very close-minded. 
  But you're not. 
  Not when it comes to your friend. 
  She's funny. 
  And fun, you know? 
  The things she says, the way she dresses. 
  She's different. 
  In a good way. 
  That's why I like her so much. 
  Who does that remind you of? 
  Your friend, Jodi. 
  She sounds an awful lot like the woman that I'm gonna marry. 
  For all the same reasons. 
  Christmas special? 
  They, uh top it with red and green sprinkles. 
  Well, you let me pay for that. 
  Cassie already did. 
  Really? 
  Yeah. 
  She sent me down here. 
  Said I deserved a treat. 
  So, what brings you here, George? 
  My feet. 
  I was just out for a long walk, and I thought I'd knock on your door. 
  Is this herbal tea? 
  No, something stronger. 
  Irish breakfast. 
  Oh. 
  How'd you guess Mr. 
  O'Hanrahan would be paying you a visit? 
  I always feel welcome here. 
  Hmm, Grey House. 
  Dear old Grey House. 
  Something wrong, Cassie? 
  Oh, it's just an old house and it needs a lot of TLC. 
  It's a big responsibility. 
  Well, you're up to it. 
  After the wedding, Jake and I will be staying at his house, and I can't be two places at once. 
  Are you sure? 
  Now, George Hmm maybe running a B&B is a hands-on job. 
  And half the time I won't be here. 
  Oh, I want to hold on to Grey House, but But without the B&B income, I'm just not so sure anymore. 
  Ah, but I've been doing all the talking. 
  So is there something on your mind? 
  Oh, nothing. 
  It's funny how, uh a long walk sometimes will clear your mind. 
  Want a cup of coffee, Chief? 
  No, thanks. 
  Are you sure? 
  You look a little tired. 
  I'm fine. 
  - You working overtime? 
  - Yeah. 
  You've been out here almost every day. 
  Yeah, that's right. 
  Except tomorrow. 
  Cause you're getting married. 
  I got that covered, too, Leon. 
  Yeah, I bet you do. 
  Well, we'll see you around, huh? 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Merry Christmas! 
  Merry Christmas! 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Thank you very much. 
  Got the dress! 
  It's all fixed up! 
  And ready for the big night. 
  Oh. 
  Thanks. 
  It's not about the dress, is it? 
  Lori, you can tell me anything. 
  I don't have the ring. 
  I lost it. 
  You gave it to me, you trusted me, and I let you down. 
  Oh, honey. 
  No tears. 
  Okay? 
  But you told me it belonged to your mother. 
  You said it was all you had left from your old family! 
  I have my memories. 
  And those can never be lost. 
  And now, I have my new family, too. 
  So let me tell you something about that old ring. 
  It has a mind of its own. 
  I've misplaced it before and that ring always finds its way back to me. 
  - Hello, Miss Nightingale. 
  - Hello, Martha. 
  If you've come to ask me back, I'm afraid Well, I didn't come for that. 
  I was wondering if you had those colour swatches that you showed me. 
  I might. 
  I was ordering table cloths, and there was this one shade of ivory Oh, yes, here it is. 
  Yes! 
  What on Earth is this? 
  My ring! 
  How did it get in there? 
  Well, what matters is you found it, Martha thank you! 
  Heavens that day in your shop. 
  I emptied my purse on your counter and after I swept everything up again I must have I feel just terrible! 
  You're not angry? 
  Of course not. 
  I suppose I shouldn't have quit on you like that. 
  Leaving you high and dry at the very last minute? 
  Oh, I had such an extraordinary event planned for the two of you. 
  I know! 
  That's why I recommended you to a wealthy client who's getting married in the spring. 
  You did? 
  You have such energy, Martha, and enthusiasm. 
  You're bursting with creative ideas! 
  And I think the job pays well, too. 
  What a lovely, unexpected gesture. 
  Why unexpected? 
  Well, for you to think of me after all that I Well, it is the season where we think of others first, don't we? 
  I don't know what to say! 
  I know you and the Mayor have other plans for Christmas Eve. 
  But the invitation is still open. 
  After all that I've done? 
  Ah, but there's so much more to do, isn't there? 
  Well, if your plans change we'd love to see you there. 
  Merry Christmas, Martha. 
  And to you. 
  Brandon! 
  Cassie found her ring. 
  That's good. 
  So now you must feel just great. 
  Pretty good. 
  Not great. 
  Why not? 
  I went to see Jodi behind your back. 
  Maybe I should have just told you what was bothering me. 
  That's what big brothers are for, right? 
  You're more than my brother, right? 
  You're my friend. 
  Aren't you? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I am. 
  Maybe I didn't act like one, though. 
  Sorry. 
  Official wedding photographer, reporting for duty. 
  Look at you! 
  Wow! 
  - Here you go. 
  - Thanks. 
  Where's Jodi? 
  I'm going to go get her. 
  I hope she has a good time tonight. 
  - Christmas is never much fun for her. 
  - Hmm. 
  Never say never. 
  - Where are you going? 
  - Oh, down to the shop. 
  Don't you have a wedding to get to? 
  Yeah, I forgot my sage. 
  Jodi and I could get it for you. 
  - Would you? 
  - Yeah, it's on the way. 
  Oh, thanks! 
  Alright, just a small bunch of dried sage. 
  I want to burn a little before the ceremony. 
  Clear the air. 
  Make way for new beginnings. 
  Here you go. 
  Okay. 
  Cassie? 
  About your cake I am so sorry. 
  Um, it was in the back of my van, and unfortunately, so was my neighbour's dachshund Oh, no! 
  Yeah! 
  This tiny dog ate the entire thing! 
  Now I am trying to get you another one, but I am totally sold out. 
  And every other bakery from here to the state capitol closed at noon. 
  Betty, put it out of your mind. 
  You get back to all the other items on your menu. 
  But it's your wedding cake! 
  What'll we do?! 
  Well, the first thing to realize is that baking is about mixing together the right ingredients. 
  I have no idea what you're saying. 
  Then look at it this way: you just brought great joy to a dachshund this Christmas. 
  Hello? 
  Hello, George? 
  Um, do you have cake mix? 
  I'll have to check why? 
  Well, I need a wedding cake for 35 guests in, um two hours. 
  Uh, George? 
  I'm here, uh A little shocked, but I'm still standing. 
  Maybe Lori could help you move things along? 
  I'm counting on you two. 
  Okay Great. 
  Do you know how to tie one of these? 
  George? 
  Are you there? 
  Was that Cassie? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it was. 
  What does she want? 
  A miracle. 
  Derek? 
  Chief, I found Leon's car. 
  But I can't find him! 
  Okay, stay on Main Street, stay with the car. 
  As long as you have the car, he's not going anywhere. 
  You got it? 
  Copy that, Jake. 
  No cake mix? 
  Even if we had all the ingredients, there's not enough time. 
  Hey, I know it looks impossible, but don't forget you've got George "Never Say Die" O'Hanrahan in your corner! 
  So, what are you going to do? 
  Beats me. 
  Derek? 
  Yeah, hi. 
  How are you? 
  Really? 
  You don't have any other way to No? 
  No, it's not your fault, no. 
  Merry Christmas. 
  I hate to ask. 
  That was the minister. 
  His car broke down, he has no other way to get here. 
  Maybe Derek could shoot up there in the squad car? 
  No, Derek's on duty. 
  Even if he could drive 100 miles an hour, it's a round trip he'd still never make it on time. 
  Well, ask people to wait. 
  Maybe we can serve them these cookies. 
  Oh, honey, we can't do that to people. 
  Not on Christmas Eve. 
  What good is a marriage license if we don't have a minister to tie the knot? 
  Robert Kowalski and Teresa Quinn? 
  - Who? 
  - Who? 
  The names on your wedding license. 
  Well, they must have given me the wrong one! 
  I've been so busy, I didn't even bother to open it! 
  Jake That's it. 
  The wedding's off. 
  No, it can't be! 
  I'll have to speak to Cassie. 
  Do you know this would be the first promise I've ever broken to her? 
  Only be a minute. 
  Oh, no problem. 
  She said a small bunch of dried sage. 
  Hanging from the ceilings. 
  Um, don't most people usually hang mistletoe? 
  Cassie says it makes way for new beginnings. 
  I wish my family could make a new beginning. 
  What do you mean? 
  You're so lucky to have your family and a dad like Jake. 
  I used to. 
  When I was little, ten years ago. 
  You remember that far back? 
  Like it was yesterday. 
  Me and my dad laughing I'd stand on his shoes and he'd waltz me around the room. 
  I keep those memories up here. 
  Locked away like treasure. 
  I take them out at night before I go to bed, and that's why I remember him so well. 
  Do you want to go to the party now? 
  Sure. 
  Cassie Jake, don't you know it's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding? 
  I know. 
  Honey we can't get married. 
  Greetings! 
  Martha, Tom, so glad you made it. 
  There's something I have to tell you. 
  We've run into some roadblocks and I'm afraid Ah, yes. 
  The wedding. 
  Wh what's this? 
  I got a call from my friend at the county office about a mix-up, so Martha and I ran over and straightened it out. 
  Our wedding license! 
  They want to know if by any chance they gave you a different license? 
  Cause there is a very anxious couple named Kowalski in Lakeville who want to get married two days after Christmas. 
  Well, we can send it with the minister after our ceremony. 
  Uh, the minister can't make it. 
  Why? 
  Car trouble. 
  So, even if we have this license, I don't see Well, you don't, but I do. 
  I'll get someone to marry you! 
  In the next five minutes? 
  My dear, I happen to have connections. 
  - Me? 
  - Yes, you! 
  By the power vested in you, etcetera, etcetera! 
  Why not? 
  Well, it's been a while. 
  Well, Mayor You can take those. 
  I know what I want to say. 
  Martha, thank you. 
  Thank you for everything! 
  Everything? 
  Whatever do you mean? 
  Well, you got us our license, our officiate, and the venue. 
  Do you remember when you told me that the Heritage Society was winding down for the holidays? 
  You really are a great wedding planner, Martha! 
  Well, anyway It's time for you two to start your new life together. 
  Jake, would you escort our guests? 
  With pleasure. 
  Cassie did a wonderful job. 
  It's a beautiful room. 
  Who gives this woman to be married to this man? 
  I do. 
  Dear friends and family, we are gathered here today to witness the loving union of Jake Russell and Cassandra Nightingale in the sacred bond of marriage. 
  Jake, please place the ring on Cassie's finger. 
  Cassie, with this ring I give you all that I am and ever will be. 
  With this ring, I thee wed. 
  Cassie, please put the ring on Jake's finger. 
  As I place this ring on your finger, I give you all that I am and ever will be. 
  With this ring, I thee wed. 
  At this time, Jake and Cassie would like to say their own vows to each other. 
  Cassie, not long ago you came into my life. 
  And nothing has been the same since. 
  Words can't easily express all that you've given me. 
  In fact, I can only think of one. 
  Magic. 
  I love you. 
  Um, Jake You gave me a home when I had none, a home in your heart. 
  And you gave me a family when I had none. 
  And I will love and cherish them as I will love and cherish you. 
  Doesn't take a crystal ball to know that you and I will be each other's strength and hope and joy. 
  And, um this is my promise to you. 
  A love that's never going to end. 
  By the authority vested in me as Mayor of Middleton, it gives me great pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife. 
  Jake, you may kiss your bride. 
  I've got something to show you. 
  Is this a wedding cake? 
  It's a cookie cake. 
  I took all the baked goods at hand and Lori and I used icing to hold it all together. 
  Oh, George, what would we do without you? 
  Cassie what if I stayed here? 
  In Middleton? 
  That would be great, George. 
  Not just Middleton. 
  In Grey House. 
  I could run the place. 
  What an interesting idea. 
  Well, I got it from you. 
  - Did you really? 
  - When you said you couldn't be in two places at once. 
  You know, it's a big job. 
  I could use a big job right now. 
  On one condition. 
  You wouldn't do all the work alone. 
  We'd be equal partners. 
  If you'll excuse me, I need to welcome all my guests. 
  Won't you come in? 
  How'd you know I was out here? 
  Well, you weren't in there, so I thought maybe you were out here. 
  Well, I, uh came to get my little girl. 
  Family is a very powerful force this time of year, isn't it? 
  I don't exactly have a family anymore. 
  Oh, Leon. 
  Where there's love, there's family. 
  You don't have to keep running. 
  So, come in from the cold. 
  Whenever you're ready. 
  - Thank you, Betty. 
  - You're welcome. 
  Isn't she a lovely bride? 
  Hope I'm not late for dinner Gwen? 
  Hello, George. 
  I thought only Cassie popped up like this. 
  I brought my daughter and grandchildren with me for a visit. 
  They've never seen snow, but now the weather station says no snow this Christmas! 
  Well, they're wrong. 
  Cassie's forecast is for snow. 
  Tonight. 
  - Well, I hope she's right. 
  - You can bet on it. 
  Is snow the only reason you came back? 
  You're the only reason I needed, George. 
  I guess you haven't heard, but after the honeymoon, I'm moving into Grey House. 
  Really, George? 
  It's a big house. 
  - I know. 
  - Lot's of room Yes, yes, there is. 
  It can use some of my Irish hospitality. 
  No doubt. 
  There we go. 
  Excuse me? 
  I wanted to give you this. 
  It's all there. 
  The money from the Shelbyville Bank job. 
  It was hidden under the floor of your shop. 
  Cassie's shop? 
  Yeah, well, it wasn't a shop when I stashed it there. 
  It was just an abandoned building. 
  Okay. 
  This isn't exactly the right time or place. 
  No, it is the time. 
  Cause I want my little girl to see me do it. 
  I had a plan to win Jodi back. 
  I figured I could convince her to run away and live with her dad. 
  But then I realized that you can't buy love. 
  And I don't want to run anymore. 
  So how do we know this isn't just another con? 
  It's not a crime to return the money. 
  And Leon has done his time. 
  Look, I know I've made some big mistakes, alright? 
  And I know it's going to take time for everybody to trust me again. 
  But I'm going to stay right here and do whatever it takes. 
  Cause I want that second chance. 
  I want a family again. 
  Jodi, I've never had anything but love for you. 
  And I know how much I hurt you. 
  I saw the hurt in your eyes the other night when you dropped the silver dollar off for Santa. 
  You were watching that family on the street, weren't you? 
  That happy family. 
  And that's all you really want for Christmas. 
  Not this money. 
  You said it yourself, angel. 
  I was a god guy once. 
  So can you let me be that guy again? 
  A second chance. 
  I guess a second chance is worth a try. 
  Jake! 
  I put a lock on his car, he can't go anywhere. 
  He's He's right here. 
  Yep. 
  Uh, Chief? 
  Does this mean that I'm off duty now? 
  Well, Derek, you put this in the lock-up. 
  Then do whatever you want. 
  So what do you say we get an early start on that Christmas date? 
  I'll save you a seat at dinner tonight. 
  Would this be a good time to say "Merry Christmas"? 
  It's going to be a very merry Christmas, cause tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up with my family. 
  Do you know the moment that I fell in love with you? 
  It was when I first saw you come down your stairs. 
  Well, it took me a little longer to fall in love with you. 
  It was when I reached the bottom of my stairs. 
  Of course, I didn't know what I was in for. 
  Well you still don't. 
  Cassie! 
  You are a bundle of Christmas surprises. 
  Well, there's a lot more where that came from. 
  - Really? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Look, it's snowing, just like Cassie said it would. 
  How did Magic happens.
