 ♪ 
 Sam : Thanks for the late dinner. 
 Ah, my kitchen's always open for you. 
 And the gluten was extra tasty. 
 That wasn't pasta? 
 It was pasta. 
 Oh, good. 
 It wasn't chicken. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 Well, the chicken that isn't chicken goes really well with the coffee that isn't coffee. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Mmm. 
 So, I'm going to let Linda move into my spare room. 
 For Nick? 
 Yeah, but not forever. 
 You're a really good father. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You play? 
 A little. 
 What's your game? 
 Texas Hold'em, what's yours? 
 Mmm! 
 Ah, if it wasn't for poker, I would've starved at med school. 
 (CHUCKLES) You wanna go a few rounds? 
 Absolutely. 
 But I gotta warn you, I have a really good poker face. 
 Actually... 
 You have a slight eye twitch when you aren't being 100 percent honest. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 I can prove it to you. 
 Oh, can you? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 Just lie to me about something. 
 Um... 
 Oh. You know, I do like this tea better than coffee. 
 Twitch. You don't like my tea? 
 Well, I like the company that comes with the tea. 
 No twitch? 
 No twitch. 
 Hmm. 
 Hmm. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Stephanie : I'll see you tomorrow. 
 You didn't have to drive my mom back to Grey House. 
 I wanted to. 
 Sounds like you two really hit it off? 
 Yeah. 
 Guess the real question's why you thought we wouldn't. 
 Are you embarrassed of me? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Look... 
 You don't know my mother. 
 What does that mean? 
 She's nice, but, she's always had certain expectations about the men I date. 
 Your mom didn't lie. 
 I didn't mean to lie. 
 Mmm. 
 And it was more of an omission than an outright lie. 
 So, when you were shuffling us around making sure we never met, that was just what? 
 That was wrong. 
 Ah. 
 Look, if you're embarrassed to let anyone know that we're dating, then why are we dating? 
 I'll see you. 
 Mom. 
 What you got there? 
 (INHALES) 
 Grace : I remember making this for Daddy. 
 You miss him? 
 Sam helps you miss him a little less, doesn't he? 
 I know that's why you don't wanna take this driving test. 
 You don't want the time you spend with Sam to be over. 
 No. 
 (CHUCKLES) Yes, but it's okay. 
 You can talk to me. 
 Talking to you will just make things worse. 
 'Cause it will make you sad, Mom, and that'll just make me miss him more. 
 Look, I can feel how badly you wanna try and make the situation better for me, but you can't. 
 No one can. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Okay, I have to go because I think Nick's waiting. 
 Okay, I love you. 
 I love you more. 
 Hi, sweetheart. 
 Mom, what's going on? 
 I'm moving in. 
 Into the spare room. 
 Your father and I both wanna live with you, so this is the perfect solution. 
 But temporary solution. 
 What do you think, Nick? 
 Great. 
 Ugh, what a mess. 
 No. You don't have to do that. 
 Yeah, I'll do it. 
 Thank you. 
 No, no, no, no, no. That goes in the disposal. 
 No, you can't put anything large in that disposal. 
 It's delicate and clogs up easily. 
 Sam, you're being silly. Disposals are meant to handle food. 
 This particular disposal can't handle more than a few grains of rice. 
 Yeah, he's right. 
 Okay, I get it. 
 Your house, no food in the disposal, got it. 
 Right. 
 Betty : Ben is very sweet. 
 He is that. 
 And successful. Self-made man. 
 Mom. 
 What? 
 Don't pretend for a second that you're okay with Ben. 
 Why wouldn't I be? 
 Ah. (CHUCKLES) 
 He's not your type. 
 And what is my type? 
 Rich. 
 I have dated and married wealthy men and not so wealthy men. 
 I don't have a problem with Ben. 
 But I think you might. 
 You should've seen him. He was so upset. 
 If you really care about Ben, you have to fight. Win him back. 
 But you have always said men should do the chasing. 
 Stephanie, you are choosing to listen to what I said decades ago instead of what I'm saying right now. 
 For the record, my last marriage was my happiest. 
 Joey. 
 And I had to pursue him all the way to Vegas. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 What's up with you not getting your license? 
 I'm not ready. 
 You're not ready for a test? No way. 
 This one is different, okay? 
 Can we please have two bagels? 
 Thanks. 
 So, I heard that your mom is moving out of Grey House. 
 Uh, yeah, she's moving in with us. 
 Okay. And how come you don't look happier? 
 I wanted there to be peace with everyone, but... 
 I never thought she'd be living at my Dad's. 
 She always has to be right. 
 Oh, can you talk to her? Tell her how you feel? 
 She wouldn't listen. 
 Okay, well then, maybe your dad can help her. 
 I don't wanna cause trouble. 
 If my dad says something to my mom, then... 
 Trouble? 
 Yeah. 
 Got it. 
 Look, my mom got what she wanted. 
 She always does. 
 What about you, Nick? 
 Does it matter? 
 Of course, it does. 
 Are you feeling bad for me? 
 Kind of. 
 Thanks. 
 Good. 
 Then you can buy me my bagel. 
 Ah. Smooth. 
 Ah. Yeah, real smooth. 
 (LAUGHING) Thank you. 
 Brandon : See you tomorrow. 
 Hey. I, uh, just wanna thank you again for taking care of my nephew. 
 Here. 
 What's this? 
 It's a gift certificate for that French restaurant in Blairsville. 
 Oh, fancy. 
 Yeah, well. 
 I was gonna bring Tara to the bistro for lunch but this is much nicer. 
 You didn't have to do this, though, I mean, Max was great. 
 Yeah, he's a sweet baby. 
 But look, man, babies are a lot of work. 
 Yes, they are. (SIGHS) 
 Bet you Tara loved Max, though, right? 
 Sure, I mean, who doesn't love a baby? 
 You need a puppy, my friend. 
 Excuse me? 
 Yeah, you gotta get a puppy. 
 It'll buy you some time. 
 My brother, before he had Max, had Bella, a rescue lab. 
 (CHUCKLES) That dog must've bought him like three years. 
 (CHUCKLES) A puppy? 
 Yeah, works like a charm. 
 Would you like some company? 
 Of course. 
 How's the work coming, any progress? 
 No, I'm afraid you were right. 
 Stephanie's not the answer to my writer's block. 
 Every day, I feel my wife's voice slipping away. 
 Well, I can tell you from experience that she's still there. 
 I wish that I believed you. 
 Belief is just a wish you make happen. 
 Thank you for everything, but I think it's time to go home. 
 Would you stop by Grey House before you leave? 
 I have a gift for you. 
 You've given me enough. It's not necessary. 
 Oh, it is necessary. 
 Then I'll come by tomorrow on my way out of town. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Sharon :   Come in. 
 Hi. 
 So, all your test results came back negative. 
 False positive. 
 Excuse me? 
 Labs make mistakes all the time. 
 The only safe way is to redo all the tests. 
 And I have two new troubling symptoms, dry eyes and dry mouth. 
 Well, you're taking an antihistamine with a decongestant. 
 It's a common side effect. 
 Well, I'm allergic to horses. 
 Hmm. You have a horse? 
 Yes, Mr. Butters. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 For a doctor, you're very easy to talk to. 
 Um, Eve mentioned you were single. 
 Is that right? 
 (DOOR CHIMES) 
 Good morning, Cassie. 
 John. 
 Did you get my flowers? 
 The arrangement was beautiful. 
 I found this book. 
 It catalogs other artifacts from the same period as your   Horse with Groom. 
 Ha. Be still my heart. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Wow. 
 So, how goes it at the university, settling in? 
 Um, I'm about as settled as I think I can get. 
 But working at the university does have its perks. 
 Do you remember Bert Branter? 
 Do I remember the foremost authority on the Indus Valley Civilization? 
 Yes, I remember him. I even met him once. 
 Well, he's speaking at the university tonight. 
 You wanna come? 
 Yes. 
 It'll be fun. 
 You're probably the only person I can think of who would think a lecture on the Indus Civilization is fun. 
 Hmm, not the only person. 
 Martha. I left Michael at home. He was just getting up. 
 Oh, poor lamb, he's exhausted. 
 (SCOFFS) From staying out late hanging out with his friends. 
 He's very popular. 
 He should be exhausted from working. 
 A job will not keep him here, in Middleton, but a career will. 
 He needs to be gainfully employed by the end of the week. 
 Things are in the works. Irons and fires all over. 
 Don't worry, I've got this. 
 What happened with the job at the bank? 
 Sadly, that interview didn't pan out. 
 He didn't get the job? 
 He didn't go to the interview. 
 (SIGHS) 
 That job wasn't right for Michael. 
 He shouldn't be an assistant at his age. 
 Enough is enough. 
 Either you have a talk with Michael or I will. 
 But, Tom. 
 Ahem. 
 Seems my sign has hopped across the street. 
 I had a feeling I might find it here. 
 I had no choice. You know Sophie quit? 
 There are no shortcuts to finding the right employee. 
 I don't have time to meet with a bunch of people. 
 I think you're looking for an easy solution to a complicated problem. 
 What does that mean? 
 That finding someone to replace Sophie isn't your only issue. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Look, I have 50 centerpieces to finish tomorrow night. 
 I need help, and everybody I know seems to be busy. 
 You think my sign will bring in someone to do all the work for you? 
 Yes. 
 You already tried that with Sophie. 
 Cassie, your sign is simply the easiest and quickest solution to my problem. 
 Okay? End of story. 
 I thought it was great. 
 Where have you two been? 
 Poulter Academy. 
 Why would you be there? 
 I set up a tour for Nick. 
 Nick has a school. 
 Yes, but... 
 And he's doing very well, there. 
 Um, and I have homework. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Did he say he wanted to switch schools? 
 No, but I can tell that he isn't being challenged at Middleton. 
 If he has a prayer of getting into a decent college, he needs a better school. 
 (SIGHS) Are you trying to drive him away? 
 Because if that's your intention, you're doing a bang-up job. 
 If he wanted me to stop, he would ask me to. 
 Seriously, leave him alone. 
 He's not a project, he's your son. 
 I thought Linda got all her bags. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Linda has a lot of baggage. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Well, I bet Nick is happy to have her back home. 
 He's not. Linda can be overbearing. 
 Hmm, people who are controlling are usually driven by fear. 
 I think Linda just likes to tell people what to do. 
 You know, Nick is lucky to have you. 
 Ah, he's a good kid. 
 If putting up with Linda, is what it takes, well, that's a sacrifice worth making. 
 When it comes to your child, there isn't anything you wouldn't do. 
 I'm not the only one. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 You're awfully dressed up for a Wednesday night. Hot date? 
 Hot lecture on the Indus Valley Civilization. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 John knows how to show a lady a good time. 
 Do you wanna come? 
 No. 
 I had enough of the Indus people at my third year cultural anthropology class. 
 Hmm. 
 I was desperate for an elective. 
 Emphasis on the desperate. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 But you have a good time. 
 Oh, I will. 
 Need a ride? 
 Isn't that out of your way? 
 Oh, it's only about eight or ten miles from the place I ordered pizza. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. No problem, I actually have a ride, but next time. 
 Okay. 
 Hi. 
 I'm working. 
 I know. 
 Brought your favorites. BLT, fries and two desserts. 
 Thanks. 
 You didn't need to do this. 
 I'm really sorry for what I did. 
 It was wrong of me, lying to you. 
 I've been doing some thinking. 
 When we first met, you thought we were too different to be together. 
 I just needed to learn to be more open. 
 That's just it. I don't think that's how a relationship should work. 
 You shouldn't have to learn to wanna be with me. 
 You should just wanna be with me, not be embarrassed. 
 I don't think we should see each other anymore. 
 Ben. 
 My treat, for the lecture. 
 Uh, no, no. You came with me, my treat. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 We can eat first. 
 Then, we'll have the strength to arm-wrestle each other for the bill. 
 (CHUCKLES) I really enjoyed the lecture. 
 I could tell, you asked more questions than anyone. 
 I can't believe Bert remembered me. 
 You are kind of unforgettable. 
 So, I have this, uh, Formal Archeology Department function tomorrow night. 
 And I don't have a plus one. 
 Anna can't make it. 
 You'll have to dress up and it'll likely be boring, including bad food and bad speeches, but I'd love to have at least one person there I know. 
 Hmm. With a buildup like that, how could I say "no"? 
 Is that a "yes"? 
 That's a "yes". 
 I think I like hearing you say "yes". 
 Well, then ask me if I'm hungry. 
 Are you hungry? 
 Yes, let's order. 
 All right. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Thank you. 
 I'm glad we got to do this. 
 Dad? 
 What's up? 
 I'm supposed to be at school and you're supposed to be at work. 
 Yeah, speaking of school, do you really wanna switch? 
 Yeah, it'll be easier. 
 Than what? 
 You know, when Mom wants something, it's easier just to go along. 
 (LAUGHING) Yes, but if you don't wanna go to private school... 
 Hey, you have a say in this. 
 Your opinion matters. What you want matters. 
 But Mom likes it her way. 
 And you're afraid if you don't go along with what your mother wants... 
 Dad, it's fine, okay? 
 It's between me and Mom. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yoo-hoo! 
 Abigail : Martha. 
 Is that a new jacket? It's very bold. 
 Oh, well, I... 
 My dinner has been moved up by an hour. 
 No problem. 
 How are my centerpieces? 
 You know, I think I'm gonna actually have to slow down because they'll be ready too soon. 
 Nobody wants wilted flowers at a dinner. 
 There's only two! 
 I will need all 50 there at least one hour before the dinner starts. 
 They will be there, on time and ready to go. 
 I saw your help wanted sign. 
 I hope I don't need to remind you how important this dinner is to me, to my position in the community. 
 I understand. 
 Well, good. 
 Because I'd hate for you to get a reputation as a businesswoman whose word cannot be trusted. 
 Hmm. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Ah, did you see that truck I passed? 
 (LAUGHING) Better than that, it saw you. 
 True. 
 And you still don't wanna take your test? 
 Ugh, no, I'm not ready yet. 
 Wait, unless you think I'm taking up too much of your time? 
 I promised that these lessons would end up with you getting your license, and they will. 
 However long it takes. 
 Thanks. (CHUCKLES) 
 Wow, your office is really cool. 
 (LAUGHING) Nobody's ever called a doctor's office "cool" before. 
 Well, it's not just the office, it's what you do here. 
 And I love science. I'm in AP chemistry and biology. 
 Double-threat. Should I call ahead to Stanford and reserve your room? 
 (LAUGHS) I actually wanna go to Yale. 
 I'm also in AP physics. 
 (SCOFFS PLAYFULLY) Is that all? 
 (LAUGHS) Hey! 
 (PHONE CHIMES) 
 Oh, um, I'm so sorry to drive and run, but I'm gonna be late for my study group. I'll see you later. 
 Hey, Grace. 
 Yeah? 
 Nice job today. 
 Thank you. 
 Hi. 
 Oh. 
 Is this, uh, Grace's? 
 
 
 
 (DOORBELL RINGING) 
 Hello. 
 Hi. Cassie asked me to come by. 
 Are you, by any chance, Carl Winstead? 
 Wow! 
 I am such a fan. 
 Carl : Thank you. 
 I was just reading this or, rereading this. 
 Apparently, Cassie's a fan too. She has all your books. 
 This is the third time I've read this and I still, I can't put it down. 
 That's sweet of you to say. 
 You write the most beautiful love stories. 
 My wife, she taught me a lot about love. 
 Ah, so, she's your muse. 
 Yes. 
 You know, when my husband died, I was inconsolable. 
 And a friend gave me one of your books. 
 And reading your novels, somehow allowed me to forget for a bit how sad I was. 
 Got me through the first year. 
 I recently lost my wife. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah, it's been overwhelming. 
 Of course, it is. 
 What are you doing for yourself? 
 To keep your mind not quite so focused on grief? 
 You have to find something. 
 It's the only way you're gonna get through it and survive. 
 Where's my PlayStation? 
 Your father, he lets you play way too many videogames. 
 Honestly, just try it for a week, you'll see. 
 Hey, come here for a sec. 
 Listen, I was thinking that I would come and watch your practice today. 
 Uh, it might be canceled. 
 It might be canceled? Is it canceled or not? 
 I'm, I'm not sure. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Nicky, you know I can tell when you're not telling the truth, right? 
 It's right there, the raised eyebrow. It's your tell. 
 Ever since you were three years old and knocked that vase over in our living room and blamed it on the dog. 
 We didn't have a dog. 
 Exactly! Not a good liar then, not a good liar now. 
 (SIGHS) Mom, I don't wanna be on the team. 
 Nick, you've made a commitment. 
 Yeah, but still... 
 And you're very good at it. 
 But I don't like it. 
 Oh, look, it's only until the end of the year. 
 Next year, you'll be at Poulter, and if you don't wanna play basketball, then, sweetheart, you don't have to. 
 Poulter has an excellent squash team. They're nationally ranked. 
 You like squash. 
 Hey, there. 
 Oh, hey, Sam. 
 This is Grace's. 
 Oh, she'd be heartbroken if she lost this. 
 She gave it to her father when she was a little girl. 
 I think I know why she doesn't wanna take her driving test. 
 She misses her dad so much. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. 
 Hard enough losing Jake, but watching Grace and Lori and Brandon lose their father... 
 I've never known loss like that. 
 I hope you never do. 
 And like everything you do, you make it look effortless. 
 You can talk to me about this, anytime. 
 I'm a pretty good listener. 
 Grace would be really upset if she knew we were having this conversation. 
 What conversation? 
 There's nothing worse than seeing your child in pain, knowing no matter what you do, you can't fix it for them. 
 (EXHALING) 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Come in. 
 Hey. 
 Michael! 
 Come, come, sit. 
 Michael, there is a slight problem with your father. 
 Is this about my cell phone bill? 
 No... Wait, what bill? 
 (SIGHS) Never mind. 
 No, your father is insisting that you get a job. 
 Now. 
 (SIGHS) Dad doesn't get me, but you do. 
 That's why I love you. You're always there to protect me. 
 But don't worry, Mom, I have a meeting later on today. 
 You have a meeting for a job? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Where? With whom? Can I help? 
 I don't wanna jinx it. 
 Say no more and I will ask no more. 
 Oh, and I used your car and it's on empty. 
 Do you want me to fill it up for you? 
 What a sweet and thoughtful gesture. 
 Should I put it on your credit card? 
 Oh. (CHUCKLES) 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Thanks, Mom. (KISSES) 
 And so, when everything gets back into the lab, Eve'll give you a call, okay? 
 It'll be fine. 
 Sharon is trying to schedule a bunch of tests. 
 She's on her way back from the farm. 
 (SIGHS) I'll call her back. 
 She's becoming a real pest. 
 What? 
 Sorry. 
 No, it's okay. 
 It's great, actually. Call Sharon back. 
 Get the number for that farm where she boards her horse and get them on the phone for me, please. As soon as you can. 
 Ben broke up with me. 
 He's being totally unreasonable. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 It's broken. 
 Hello, we're talking here. 
 As I was saying, Ben is being completely unreasonable. 
 When it comes to relationships, it's important to find someone who loves you for who you are, but you have to love them for who they are too and you have to admit, you haven't been as enthusiastic as Ben has about the two of you dating. 
 That's true. 
 No one asked you. 
 Okay, but it's still true. 
 You know what I think? 
 I think that maybe all this is for the best. 
 Ben and I don't belong together. 
 Maybe we shouldn't even have started dating. 
 If you really believed that, you wouldn't be here. 
 No. (SIGHS) 
 I really think it's over. 
 It's not working. 
 It's not broken. You're just not using it properly. 
 Your intention was to only serve yourself. 
 But I won't be serving anybody, because there's no way I can finish the centerpieces on time and Martha's going to take my business tonight when her dinner is flower free. 
 So, you're giving up? 
 I can't do it. Not by myself. 
 Wouldn't it be better to try and fail than to just fail? 
 No, what's the point of putting in the effort if you know there's no hope of succeeding? 
 (DOOR CHIMES) 
 There's always hope. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi, Sam. 
 Abigail. 
 I need to ask you a favor. 
 Name it. 
 May I take Grace to the hospital, later today? 
 Hospital? 
 Oh, you know that thing that I'm not supposed to know or talk about? 
 Yeah? 
 I got a plan. 
 I think you're rubbing off on me. 
 And taking her to the hospital will help? 
 Should be just what the doctor ordered. 
 Pun intended. 
 Well, good luck. 
 I got this. 
 Now, I have to go see a man about a horse. 
 Literally. 
 I can't believe Sam is still on the market. He's such a catch. 
 So, what should we order? 
 (SIGHS) Well, when I thought I might be pregnant, I went online, and there was a long list of things you shouldn't eat. 
 Oh, now you can have whatever you want. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oysters? 
 We can split a dozen. 
 All right, but you order your own souffle. I'm not sharing. 
 (BOTH LAUGHING) 
 I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 For being all over the place about wanting to start a family. 
 Hey, you are the sweetest, kindest, most caring person I know. 
 You're already a great person, so you're gonna make a great mom. 
 Are you saying you're ready? 
 What do you think about getting a puppy? 
 A puppy? 
 What happened to your room? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Mom fixed it. 
 (SCOFFS) Was it broken? 
 Dad. 
 It's your room. 
 Yeah, you always tell me it's a mess. 
 And that I should move where my desk is. 
 Well, I might think that, but it's your space. 
 Mom is... 
 I can see you're not happy. 
 But I should be. 
 We're all together and there's no fighting. 
 But you're not. 
 I love Mom. 
 She loves you. 
 She hasn't lived with me since I was a kid, not full time anyway. 
 I can talk to your mom, if you want. 
 Linda : Talk to me? 
 About what? 
 Um. 
 Mom, wouldn't you be happier in your own place or back in New York? 
 Sam, did you put him up to this? 
 No, no, no, no, no. This wasn't Dad. 
 Nick, you don't know what you need. I do. 
 I have your best interests at heart. 
 (SIGHS) Nick. 
 It's not okay. 
 You're so determined to control him, that you're gonna lose him. 
 You can make things easier for him. 
 I just don't know if you will. 
 So I needed to drop off some lab work and I just thought you might wanna come with me. 
 Thank you. This place is great. 
 We do share an affinity for science. 
 We do. 
 We don't get to see enough of you, Dr. Radford. 
 He's a fan favorite around here. 
 Thank you. 
 The nurses really like you here. 
 Oh, well, this place has a terrific staff. 
 What is this? 
 I decided to take on an intern or two from your high school at my office. 
 And as soon as I get the principal to sign on, it's a go. 
 For somebody interested in science, it would be a really good learning experience. 
 You know anybody? 
 Why me? 
 Look, um, I see a lot of people at their very worst moments. 
 Especially when I was running the ER in New York. 
 Death and dying is part of what I deal with every day. 
 But I've learned that one way to heal from loss is to give your heart something else to love. 
 Not to replace what it is you lost, but just to make the emptiness less empty. 
 I know you miss your dad. 
 And I wish I had more to offer you than an internship. 
 But what do you say? 
 I say, I better schedule my driving test. 
 You're ready. 
 I am, thanks to you. 
 (CHUCKLING) 
 The question my heroine poses to herself is, "Can you have a once in a life time love twice in a lifetime?" 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Oh, don't apologize, this has been a real treat for me. 
 I didn't recognize that passage. 
 It's from his upcoming book. 
 It's something I started before my wife died. 
 It's beautiful. You really should finish it. 
 A gift is totally unnecessary. 
 Open it. 
 I acquired this notebook at an estate sale in England. 
 The woman who sold it to me said that the owner was a famous English writer. 
 Apparently, it was the only blank notebook in his library. 
 She said he kept it to remind him of the darkest time in his life. 
 A time he lost his voice. 
 It's too much. 
 I was just holding it, waiting for the right person. 
 And that's me? 
 This inspiration you have, it doesn't lie within anyone else. 
 Not your lovely wife. 
 It's in you, and only you have the power to unlock it. 
 Your wife is always with you. 
 You don't have to find her. She's always there, in your heart. 
 If you give up writing, you'll have lost two things you love. 
 And your fans need you. 
 There's a shortage of love stories in the world. 
 Well, then, I better keep writing. 
 Thank you, Cassie Nightingale, for everything. 
 Sharon : You think I have Lyme disease? 
 How? 
 It's passed into the bloodstream through the bite of a deer tick. 
 But I'm not around deer. 
 Your horse is. At that farm, where you board him. 
 But all those other doctors I saw? 
 The test for Lyme disease is unreliable until after the first two months. 
 In the early stages, the flu-like symptoms are often misdiagnosed. 
 You're sure? 
 Both the tests came back positive. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Can I get better? 
 Sure, but it might be a long road to recovery. 
 And you may have some permanent side effects that you have to monitor, treat... 
 But I'm gonna do everything in my power to get you feeling better. 
 And you won't be alone. 
 I'll be with you every step of the way. 
 Thank you, Dr. Radford. 
 Sure. 
 I know you want to say it. 
 I don't need to say, "I told you so." 
 Or that I was right and you were wrong about Sharon. 
 (CHUCKLES) But you just did. 
 Did I? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (DOOR OPENING) 
 Hey, Sam. 
 Hmm, you want some tea? 
 Uh, no thanks. 
 Erythropoietin. 
 The hormone that regulates the rate of erythrocyte production. 
 35 across. 
 Mmm-hmm. Thank you. 
 I can't stand to start a puzzle and not finish it. 
 We have that in common. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Oh, hey, Sam. 
 Hey. 
 Did you tell her yet? 
 Uh, I was just about to. 
 Tell me what? 
 I'm going to be interning at Sam's office. 
 If that's okay with you? 
 Of course. 
 Uh, but I need to take my driving test first. 
 That way, I can fully concentrate on the internship. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 I'm totally psyched. (CHUCKLES) 
 Thanks again, Sam. 
 Sure. 
 Thanks for helping me solve that puzzle. 
 You know there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you guys. 
 Hmm. 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Nick told me that you were here. 
 So listen, the disposal is backed up, and it's making these grinding noises. 
 Clearly, it's defective. (CHUCKLES) 
 Clearly. 
 Yeah, excuse me. 
 Thanks, Sam. 
 So, I Imagine you've heard that Sam got Nick to support the idea of me going back to New York? 
 No, Sam hasn't said a word, but knowing Nick, he's speaking his own mind, not Sam's. 
 Cassie, he's a child. 
 No, look again. You aren't seeing Nick for the young man he is. 
 Well, either way, it doesn't matter because with both of them against me, I am not gonna win this war. 
 It's not a war. It's your family. 
 And it's not about winning, it's about love. 
 Linda : Nick, can you come here? 
 Mom? 
 Sweetheart, I, um... 
 I have a little bit of bad news. 
 It seems that my CFO has unexpectedly quit, and the board is requiring me to go back to New York right away. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. 
 (CHUCKLES) Oh, no. 
 No, honey, I'm... I'm... 
 I'm not going because of anything that you said. 
 I know that you were upset, and we all say things we don't mean when we're upset. 
 This has everything to do with my job, which I have to be in New York to do. 
 I have an entire company depending on me. 
 And you, you have your... 
 You have your dad here to take care of you. 
 You'll be back, right? 
 Of course, and you will come visit me. 
 I will. 
 Love you, Mom. 
 I love you, too. 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 I love my son. 
 Then you did the right thing. 
 Martha, did I miss it? 
 The ballroom is empty, did I get the time wrong? 
 I didn't have a truck, so I had to carry them by hand and then, I... 
 No, you didn't miss it. 
 The dinner is not in the ballroom. It's in Conference Room B, which is down the hall and to the left. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Go and find Chief Sanders and he'll get you some help to carry the centerpieces. 
 I have to go and finish working on my opening remarks. 
 Oh, my. That is stunning! 
 Thanks. 
 You know, there is a City Council welcome luncheon next week. 
 I'm gonna phone you later with my order. 
 Abigail? 
 Yeah? 
 You're five feet from the finish line, dear. 
 Go and get those flowers where they're supposed to be. 
 Chop-chop. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 My pleasure. 
 Sorry, no food. 
 I tried to get the last two cheese blintzes, but sadly, I lost that to a tenured literature prof. 
 Forgive me. 
 John. 
 Hey, Bill. 
 And this must be Anna. 
 Uh... 
 Cassie. (CHUCKLES) 
 My mistake. 
 Oh. It's okay. Cassie's an old friend from my college days. 
 So you two went to college together, huh? 
 We did. 
 Yeah. We haven't seen each other in 20 years, and now we're both living in Middleton. 
 Amazing. 
 Yeah. You're right. It is amazing. 
 So, when will Anna be joining you? 
 Uh, she won't. 
 We decided to make our temporary break permanent. 
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 That's the Dean. If you'll excuse me. 
 (CHUCKLES) Sure. 
 Bill : Thanks. 
 Hmm. 
 (ENGINE STARTING) 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Thank you. 
 I was gonna tell you. 
 That you and Anna broke up? 
 Yeah. 
 What happened? 
 Well, we were apart more than we were together. 
 Wow. That can be fixed. 
 We're still better apart. 
 It's a beautiful night. 
 Yeah. 
 But not as beautiful as that night in Ibiza. 
 Oh, but less scary. (LAUGHING) 
 In my defense, it was Brooke's idea to wedding crash. 
 (SIGHS) 
 It's kind of chilly. Do you wanna go back inside? 
 No, I like it out here. 
 Thank you. 
 (CELL PHONE RINGING) 
 Um, sorry. 
 Um... 
 Oh, I have to take this, I'm sorry. 
 Hey, Sam, is everything okay?
