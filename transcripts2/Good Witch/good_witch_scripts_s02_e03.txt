 Previously on  Good Witch: It's clear you don't want to have a baby. 
 Been great working for you. 
 You're quitting?! 
 Will you please teach me how to drive? 
 John! 
 Can I come in? 
 Linda told me about your ex- boyfriend moving to town. 
 Is there someone else? 
 You were fearless. 
 Oh no, I wasn't. An armed militia stops you at the border; it's kind of a big deal! And you, you're the reason we got through. Hey, Mom! Oh, hi! Hi! Sam, Grace, this is John; he's an old friend. both : Nice to meet you. Grace and John : Hi! So, how's the driving lesson? Oh, I killed it, right? Well, you are too modest. She's becoming quite a parallel parker. Oh yeah... well, sit, both of you. Oh, I would love to but pre-calc is calling my name. It was nice to meet you, though. You too, Grace. Thanks, Sam. Bye. Would you like a glass of wine? Oh, I don't wanna interrupt. I was just about to ask Cassie to authenticate a Chinese artifact for me. Ming or Tang? That's what I need you for. You authenticate art? Um, I studied art history in college; it's just a hobby. She plays a mean game of Scrabble in Farsi. Farsi? Yeah, Cassie speaks five languages..? Uh, six! Six. I stand corrected. Listen, I have to get back to a faculty thing, so... Just bring it by the shop. Thanks, I will. Nice to meet you, Sam. Nice to meet you. Bye. Hm! What? Well, this has been educational! Authenticating art? Oh well, it's my past. Yeah, but I think the good archeologist is trying to unearth it. Mm-hm. (theme music) Ryan. Cassie Nightingale. You're back! Yeah, I had some unfinished business, I figured I'd drop by and say hi. Well, I'm glad you did! Um, maybe we can have lunch? Yeah, we do need to talk. Well, just say when and where. OK. Tomorrow. At that new place in Yorkville. One o'clock? Great. It's a date. Not a "date", it's a... you know. I do. (cell ringing) It's my inspector; I sold my house just... Hey, there. Can you just give me a second? Thanks. I gotta take this. I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Great. Hello? Yeah. OK. Stop that. Stop what? Smiling. But you like it when I smile. Not when I'm trying to stay mad at you. How could anyone stay mad at this face? (stifled snort) Ah... Come on, can we just table the baby talk for now? I guess we can do that. Great. But not forever. I know. (door closing) I've got to feed Nick breakfast and Linda stripped my kitchen of all gluten. Well, studies have shown that... that you should be able to have whatever you want in your kitchen? And that is why I'm here, to borrow bread and cereal and then, tonight, I'm taking back my kitchen one box of pasta at a time. Good for you! You know, I still can't get over you being an authenticator of art. I am! You never said! Well, it's not something that comes up in conversation. Ah... You know, there's a new gallery opening over in Blairsville. We could go check it out. I didn't know you were into art! ...love art! Really? Yes! What's your favourite period? The... blue period. I can't wait to discuss all things blue with you, soon. Thank you! Mm-hm! Those are beautiful! Thanks! Positively guaranteed to make her swoon. Cassie, hey! Hi! What do you think? Well, you've obviously found your passion. Hi, Sophie! Hey! Business is booming. I love being the only flower game in town. But it's just you and Sophie? Mm-hm! Derek! I have this arrangement for Stephanie from Ben. Isn't the Bistro right on your way to work? Uh... Say no more. Thank you. Such a sweet, helpful man. Abigail... What? Who doesn't like to be the bearer of fresh cut flowers? A small business lives or dies on how much effort the owner is willing to put into it. I'm working 24-7. Ouch! (phone ringing) Abigail's Flower Market. No problem. Got it; Thursday. (Beep!) That was Martha; she ordered 25 centerpieces for her town hall banquet meeting... in three days. Great! No problem. We'll just have to work double time. Well, sounds like you've got everything under control! Don't I always? Why don't we go to Blairsville for an early dinner? Oh, I was thinking we could get pizza and watch the game. Uh-huh... You wanna go out, don't you. OK, I'll tell you what, I'll record the game, we go out for dinner. Really? Yeah! I'll swing by after work and pick you up. Perfect. Table 3 asked for you. OK! Hi! What can I do for you? Stephanie. Mom! Heh heh heh! You're here! Hmm! Hmm... (knocking) I'm running a little behind, sorry. Mrs. Benton. Uh, it's "Miss". I'm single. Oh! My mistake. And it's Sharon. Well, Sharon, why don't you tell me what brought you in today. FOP. FOP? You think you have  Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva? It's a pretty rare disease! (laughing): I think there are only... 700 confirmed cases. I know. What are the odds, right? One in 2 million, actually. Um, Sharon... (sighing): ... Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive is a rare genetic disease that causes the body's fibrous tissue, ligaments, muscles to transform into bone. (sighing): I'm so relieved that you've heard of it. My last 2 doctors couldn't even pronounce it. Let me guess; you been online. Yes. What makes you think that you have this incredibly rare disease? (sighing): I have this dull ache throughout my entire body, especially in my ankle. Why don't we take a look? Oh, and then, there's this, my big toe. It's totally malformed; classic symptom, right? Why don't we run some tests and get an X-ray of that ankle? If you think that's what's best. (knocking) Come in, Chief Sanders! (more knocking) (to herself): For goodness sake! (then): How many times do I need to tell you that you don't need to keep knocking if I've said "come in"! Michael! Hey, Mom. You're home! OH! Ah! (sniveling): You're too thin; we must feed you immediately. (little snicker) Oh, I'm so sorry, your order is almost ready. It's just really crazy here, today. Ah, are you OK? Ugh! My mother's here for her annual visit. I love when Betty comes to town. (with a little laugh): Well, that's because you aren't on the receiving end of all her well-meaning but annoying advice. She loves you. And I love her. But she drives me crazy every time she comes to town and, since she never bothers you, can she stay at Grey House? Yes, absolutely! Great. Here you go! So... has she met Ben? Absolutely not! She's gonna love Ben, everyone does. But she won't approve of him. You're sure it's your mother who doesn't approve of Ben's job status? I like Ben, I do, it's just... (sighing): ...we're so different. I don't know, I think things could work out between Ben and I, but not if my mother gets involved. Hiding him from your mom isn't gonna help things; it may actually make things worse. Lunch for two! So, who's your date? I'm authenticating some art. Mm-hm! (snigger) The man at the far table looks familiar. He should; he's been in here every day all week. Fifteen fifty. So? Ming Dynasty, 1400 AD. It's extremely well preserved, no sign of repair or restoration. It's a lovely piece, but it's not the only one of its kind. Man, you would've made an amazing archeologist. I love the past, but I have found more joy focusing on the here and now. Well, not me. When I'm on a dig, I can imagine what life was like in simpler times. I like that. Yeah, but when looking back sometimes, we remember things how we thought they were, instead of how they really were. True. Very true. I would love to take you out. Pay back the favour. How about lunch tomorrow you pick the place. I have plans with... a friend. Well, you let me know when your schedule clears. (door opening) Hey! Hey! I got back from my run and you guys were gone! Yeah, well, Mom was on one of her quests looking for freshly pressed juice. "Pressed", like a... suit? It's good for Nick. Pressed juice is full of nutrients and vitamins and Nick needs that, especially now that he's working out twice a day. (He sighs, then she sighs.) I got rid of all of that. Yeah, I put it back. You know, if you wanna poison your body, you go right ahead, but our son deserves better. I'm gonna be late for school. I'll drive you. Hey, listen, I wanna try that new Greek restaurant tonight, you, me and Nick. My treat, OK? Hey, Cassie. Hey, Brandon. I told Grandpa I'd handle grocery shopping for him while he's away this week. Do you have a list for me? I do! Great. You know, George usually picks up the pastries for the guests' breakfast as well. Oh, I can do that; Bistro's on my way. Yeah, I think the Bistro's an excellent idea. (little laughs) Hey, it's the good doctor! Ryan! Are you back? Yeah, I am! Temporarily? Depends. On..? Ah, a lot of things. Does Cassie know you're back? Yeah, she does, actually. We're having lunch today. So, you're still single? Yes and Linda's still in town. Ooh... right; the wife! Ex-wife. Ex... Can't be easy. Great for my son, though. Yeah, of course, of course... Listen, I'll tell Cassie you said hello. Great! Hey, you ready? For your lesson, yep! Was that just Ryan? Yeah, it was. I didn't know he was back in town. Neither did I. It's lovely. Oh! It is! My wife always wore wraps like this. She was always cold. How long... since your wife passed away? If you were divorced, you wouldn't still wear the ring. Ah. A few months ago. My condolences. Thank you. I'd like to purchase it. Consider it a gift. Thank you! Of course. Hey! I'm here to pick up the order for Grey House. Thanks. (baby cooing) He looks just like you. (laughing): Hey, man. Don't joke. Actually, his mom says that to everybody in the family. Personally, I think I have better hair. Meh... Brandon, meet Max, my nephew. Hello, Max! Emergency came up with his mother, so... I'm on uncle duty. Oh! Hey, uh... you think you might be able to watch him for a little bit? I gotta run by the station. But you're off today. I am, and that means that Don's in charge. Which is why the dispatcher's threatening to quit and... come on. I gotta bring some things over to Grey House. That's perfect! I can swing by Grey House; I'll meet you there! OK. Yes! Just rock him, alright? He likes movement. Yeah, well, you know, what I like is punctuality. Don't worry, as long as Max has his pacifier, it'll be easy! Thank you! (blowing out air) (cooing) How in the world can you be afraid of squirrels? Oh, how can you not be? Their little diabolical paws, their scrunched up faces and that squirrel darted right in front of us on purpose. You give him too much credit. He was messing with me. Spiders. What about them? They're my squirrel; I hate them. But spiders are good luck, whereas squirrels... ...menacingly dart out at the traffic on purpose? Yes, exactly. (chuckles) This has been fun, teaching you to drive. Well, it's not over yet. True! You probably have time for one more lesson before you test. And you don't need a ride? No, I'm fine. See ya! OK, bye-bye. These are all from Sharon. At this point, she needs her own dedicated phone line. You do know she has a reputation, right? Not that kind of reputation! She's in that book club that I joined. Mm-hm, rumour is, she spends most of her time going from one doctor's office to another. Yet, she never gets better. Think she's a hypochondriac? I don't think she's actually sick. As much as I trust the diagnostic ability of your book club, my gut tells me that something is wrong. OK... you're the doctor! I am. But when you find out that I'm right and you're wrong, I so get to say, I told you so. So, I was thinking, cocktail hour with a specialty drink, and then, a formal sit down dinner. Steak and lobster. Ooh! A real celebration! What do you think? Tom?! Tom!! What do you think? Michael's welcome home party. He's moving back because he got fired and he's broke. He quit that terrible job. It was unsuitable for his intellect and his abilities. He was a waiter in a themed restaurant. So you agree! Completely beneath him. He's... he's special. He's a real talent. Martha, he's an adult and he's gotta grow up someday. Let's make that "someday" now. Maybe we should have his party at a restaurant! Your cousin Jennifer just got engaged. Shy little Jennifer getting married before you; it's inconceivable! Ugh, OK, she has been dating her fiancé since middle school. It's not only conceivable, it's a little bit anticlimactic. I just don't like the idea of you alone. I want you to put yourself out there, you.. you need to date, you need a plan! OK, if I fall in love and it all works out, I'll get married. That's not a plan, that's a dream. Thanks, Mom. Just came in to get a potted plant for my mother and I'm leaving with 2 dozen roses! Such a good son! (chuckle) And handsome too! Ha! It's OK, Sophie, I got this one. (sigh) Thank you so much. This arrangement that Martha ordered is very complicated and time consuming. Oh, you'll get it! You always do. (sigh) 
 
 Hi! Wow! Abigail, this place is great! Thanks! Sit? I don't know, you look very busy, it's fine. I'm never too busy for my favourite cousin. Girl talk? Always. (little chuckle) Oh! Let me, let me, it's OK. Thanks. Ah, I've just been working so hard on this big order from Martha, I must just be exhausted. Oh, well, if you want, I'm happy to help. Only if you want to; Sophie's a little overwhelmed. Just layer each vase with an even mix of pebbles and then Sophie will add the flowers. OK! So, tell me, what's it like to own your own business? It's super fun! So you guys are good here, then? What? Great, 'cause I could really use a break. Oh. Ha. So, uh, you sold your house? Yeah, but it failed the electrical inspection. You should get a second opinion, another inspection. There's a backlog of inspectors, it would take too long to make an appointment. I bet Martha would help you out. I think she has not forgotten that I helped bring that mall project to Blairsville. Well, people can surprise you. Yeah... sometimes, in good ways and sometimes, in not so good ways. I surprised you, that night. Yeah. What happened? I mean, I didn't imagine what was going on between us before that night and I know I did not imagine what I saw between you and Sam. I think I want an explanation. When Sam almost kissed me... I was as surprised as you. That he wanted to kiss you? That I wanted to kiss him. So why aren't you two together? Because I'm still not ready to be with anyone. So there's still a chance that maybe, when you are ready, we could start again? I don't feel that way about you. I thought I did but I don't. OK. Look, we were friends before we were anything else. Yeah, but I always wanted more. I'm so sorry. Me too. 'Cause I can't forget how I feel and just go back to being friends. (sigh) (birds chirping) Brandon? Where are you? Back here! I got your text, what's the emergency? Oh! Oh wow! That's really cute! Well, don't get any ideas. Too late. Where did the baby come from? Hi! Um, this is Derek's nephew, Max. Uh, here. Oh! Uh... Where's Derek? He's stuck at the station. Hello! (cooing) Oh my goodness! Um, here. Oh! Ha ha. (cooing) Oh, you're a natural. Ha ha! But seriously, I need you to take him 'cause I need a break. Oh, why don't you just stay? We'll do it together, it'll be fun. Ah, almost. You just need to put a little more arc on it. Uh, Mom texted; said she was making chicken. OK. Uh, Dad? Yeah? I gotta ask, did you and Mom ever get along? Oh yeah, sure! When we first got married. Well, what happened? People change. We... changed. All I can remember since I was a kid was... you two fighting. Now, it's like a normal family. It's nice having Mom around. Well, she loves you very much. Hey, Grace! Oh! Hey! What's up? You ready for your last driving lesson? Um, actually, I was thinking about that and... it may not be our last. Why, what do you mean? I thought maybe I would postpone my driving test. It's just I have a lot going on and I can always take it next year. Plus it'll give you and I more time to practice. You're ready. I don't think I am. Anyways, you guys have fun. I won't keep you. What was all that about? I don't know. Enjoy. Mom! Don't look so surprised. I just thought you were doing that walking tour of downtown. Oh, I'd much rather spend time with you! Hey! Oh, why don't you head back to Grey House and relax, and I can... I just got here. Right, OK, I, um, I just need to see a customer but you stay, right here, OK? Hi! (embarrassed chuckle) So, let's just head out of here. (laughing): Wait, I was just gonna sit at the counter. Oh! Why would you wanna be inside, it's so beautiful out. Who's that woman you were talking to? Oh, no one. Hey, here's an idea, since it's so busy, why don't I personally deliver a late lunch to you once the crowd dies down. I was just gonna have a snack. Snack, lunch; whatever! Heh heh! OK..! OK! (chuckles) (little chuckle) Aah... Who was that man? Oh, uh, just a customer. Ah, see, your attitude is part of the problem. That cute man could be... more than just a customer. Hm. (door chimes) Martha, you are beaming! Michael's home. And all is right with the world. He quit that horrible job in California and he's decided to move back to Middleton permanently. Oh, so he'll be looking for a job locally? Uh-uh! Not a job; a career. Ah... Hm... This is infused with amber, which ancient civilizations believed contained rays of the sun. Amber's restorative and has the ability to light a fire under people, so to speak. To help with Michael's career. Oh, well, thank you! But no. Michael doesn't need any hocus pocus. He will be gainfully and properly employed by tomorrow. I... I pulled a few strings and I set up a job interview for assistant to the Middleton bank president. I'll have Michael's career on track in no time. Well, tell Michael I wish him luck. My dear Cassie, luck is not necessary when you're a Tinsdale! (snigger) Hey. Aw, what took you so long? I had to go to 2 different stores to find the right diapers. I've never seen so much stuff come out of something so small! (chuckles) Yeah, but he is awfully cute. Aw, he hates me. What, how can you say that? Here. OK. Come here, buddy. Oh yeah. Ah! Why does he like you more than me? It's not a competition. Yeah, says the guy winning. Hey, I'm wearing a t-shirt I found in the trunk and I smell like baby puke. Honey, there are no winners in this room. He's probably just hungry. But if we feed him, he's just gonna use up all the diapers again. Check the bag, there's probably a bottle of formula. Uh, yeah. So, warm it up and, um, test the temperature on your wrist. I used to take care of Grace when she was a baby. Didn't you ever babysit when you were young? No. And I was an only child. Don't worry, buddy, I'll test it before I give you the bottle. (glass shattering) Just to be safe. (baby cooing loudly) Yeah, well, would it kill you to give her a smile? What's bothering you? Your forehead gets a certain pattern when you try to figure something out. And that's a pretty big medical file, there. (sighing): There is something wrong with this patient and I don't know what. Hm. But I'll figure it out. I like that about you. My tenacity? One of your best qualities. (chuckles) Um... Ryan is back. We had lunch... Um... I meant to tell you. But you were hesitant. Ryan brings up a lot of things for me. So, how was lunch? Ugh... complicated. How did you leave things? Well, he wants something from me that I just can't give him no matter how much I care about him, so... not well. Hm... Seeing Ryan and talking to him just made me realize that, right now, I'm not ready for anything more than friendship. Duly noted. And look, as... your friend, who... just wants you to be happy, I really hope you're able to patch things up with him. Thank you, Sam. And for the record, if I had been Ryan, that wouldn't have happened. 'Cause I never would've left you behind. It's hard, huh? I was just... Quiet! He just stopped crying. (sighing): I can't take anymore crying. He's a baby; it's his primary mode of communication. (baby whimpering) Where's his pacifier? (whimper) He just had it! (Baby starts to cry.) We have to find it. When I left him with you, he had it! Hey, we need to hold the line, here, can't turn on each other! OK, OK. Maybe there's a spare. Ah, no luck. Hm... Oh! Kitchen. Kitchen, what? Tara, he can't walk! What do you think; he took it out, crawled into the kitchen and still fully made his way back? I mean, he's a baby, he's not Delta Force! (cooing) Found it. Hiding in plain sight! (cooing) There you go! See? Everything's OK. Hey! Hi! (conversations) Does she know who it's from? No. Well, she does bear a striking resemblance to your wife. It's uncanny. I know you don't wanna hear this, but... Stephanie's not the answer to your problems. (phone ringing) (banging into the door) (key rattling in latch) Sophie! (phone still ringing) Sophie!! (sigh) (Beep!) Abigail's Flower Market, this is Abigail speaking. Hi, Martha! Uh... Sorry! 25 more centerpieces for the banquet. Yes, that does make 50. Yeah, of course, of course; got it. Two days. (breathing in) No problem. (Beep!) Sharon called; she wants another appointment. Well, let's... squeeze her in. (taking a deep breath): Doc... you DO see what she's doing, don't you? What are you talking about? She's crushing on you. (guffawing): That's nonsense. OK! But watch yourself 'cause from where I stand, you're like a turkey walking around, one day before Thanksgiving, clueless and on the menu. (conversations) Michael! Hey, Mom. Well? Tell me how the interview went! When do you start? What's your salary? Any perks? Will you have your own assistant? No, I didn't go. Mom, being an assistant at my age is not what I had in mind. I wanna hold out for something better that showcases my talent. Oh... (cell ring) I gotta take this. Danny! Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, hold on. Mom, I was gonna go meet Danny, you know, from high school. Do you have any cash? Just enough to get me through the week. Ah! You're the best, Mom. It's good to be home. Hm! Well, hello there! Oh! Hi! What's up? Well, I was at the Bistro, studying, and they had one piece of that chocolate cake that you like, so I got it for you. As a thank you for the lessons. Well, that's thoughtful! Hm, thanks. Actually, glad you're here. You are?! Yeah, I wanna talk to you. Me? Sit down. Aah... What's going on? Why don't you wanna take your test? I'm just not ready. Heh! Was it... our lessons? Oh, no-no. You're a great teacher. You didn't do anything. Are you... having trouble at school? No. Home..? No. And I'd prefer not to really talk about it. OK, I won't push, but... if you do wanna tell me, I'm here. Thanks for the cake. Yeah. (little chuckle) (sigh) Hello, there! Hi! Uh, do you know where the sugar is? Uh, sugar... uh, I don't. Oh, you're not a guest here. No, no, I'm just here to do some work for Cassie. You were at the Bistro today, right? Yeah. Hey, you were talking to Stephanie. Oh, you know Stephanie? Very well! Me too! Really? I'm her mother. Thanks a lot. Oh! Oh! Hi. Hi! Uh... how goes the hunt for a new inspector? Not good, actually. If I don't find someone quickly to give my house a clean bill of health, that deal's gonna fall through. Well, some losses are worth fighting for. Oh! Sorry, I... You know, it's my fault anyway; I should've waited for my guy to do the work instead of... Oh! Hello! Martha? Goodbye! Martha. Martha! (big sigh) I know you don't owe me any favours. But I need a new electrical inspector. I can have someone at your house later today. (sighing with relief): I owe you. I owe you, thank you. Oh, I'm not doing it for you; I'm doing it for Cassie. Because any friend of Cassie's is a friend of mine, no matter how traitorous he may have been in the past. Hm! Because  it makes the most sense! No! Why shouldn't I move into your spare room? This is not some cute romantic comedy where the divorced parents live together for the sake of the child and everything works out in the end. Look, Sam, this whole family thing is no picnic for me either. I am trying so hard to stay current at my job that I have worked my entire career to land. But I'm not in New York, I'm here. Because I love our son too. I wanna move in to be closer to my Nick. OK?! Derek! Sorry, I'm late! Ugh... Hi! Where's Sophie? She quit. Ah! That happens when employees are overwhelmed. Sophie wasn't overwhelmed, she just wasn't a go-getter. I'll find other people to help out. Don't worry, things always work out for me. Well, new business thrives or dies on reputation. If you don't deliver an important order to a very vocal town mayor, I think Martha will make sure everyone hears about it. I'm the only flower shop in town. The one in Blairsville is 3 times the size and delivers. People will think twice about going to a place that has proven to be unreliable. Give them a discount and tell them thank you very much for waiting. OK? Uh, table for 2, please! I'm... treating my new friend! Ah... (door opening and chimes) I came to say goodbye. Your house passed inspection? Oh gosh, no. But Martha's inspector referred me to a reasonable electrician who can do the job quickly so the sale can go through. Well, sometimes, we all need a little rewiring. Mm-hm. You told me that sometimes, people can surprise you. Hm! Listen, I didn't... exactly leave things with you in a very good place and yet you helped me. Thank you. You said you couldn't be my friend, but I never said I couldn't be your friend. Yeah... I guess we've come full circle, haven't we. Well... maybe that means we can start all over again. I think we just did. Friends hug, right? Yeah, good friends hug. (crickets) (door opening) (door closing) Hey! Oh... (cooing) He's adorable. How long has he been here? All day. Derek's on his way over now. Did you, uh, pick up everything I need at the Bistro? (little sigh) Ahem! You wanna talk about it? No! Aah... Linda. I'm at an impasse. Marriage may not be forever, but kids are. So I have a choice, I can either make Nick happy and be miserable or make myself happy and hurt Nick. (He sighs.) I heard Ryan left town, are you OK? Yeah, it's always a little sad when friends leave. Friends again? We patched things up. I'm glad. Thank you. So, do you have any of that tea that tastes like coffee? I do and I am making pasta tonight, for dinner. Ah, gluten! (laughing): Yay! Let's! OK!
