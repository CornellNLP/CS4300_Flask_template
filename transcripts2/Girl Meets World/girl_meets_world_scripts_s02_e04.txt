 Somebody read that. 
 "History will be kind to me for I intend to write it." Winston Churchill. 
 And he did. 
 Who's gonna write their own history here? 
 What is history? I keep forgetting. 
 History is time passing. 
 Oh, yeah? How much time? 
 Someone once said, "100 years from now, all new people." 
 100 years. 
 Wrong. 
 You set me up. 
 When should you guys begin to make your own history? 
 Right now. 
 Good. 
 So, today we're talking about Winston Churchill. 
 When the new people come, how do you want them talking about you? 
 Nicely? 
 How long do we have before history makes its decision about us? 
 What if they're writing it down now? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Chapter one: Introduction. Please read. 
 "There is a comfort in knowing that history is fixed. You can no sooner change history than you can change the nine planets in our solar system from Mercury to Pluto." 
 All : Oh... 
 What? 
 Nice job, Mr. Matthews. 
 What'd he do? 
 He just showed us history books can be wrong. 
 You can change history. 
 I don't get it. 
 How can she not know? 
 Look at the bird! 
 She doesn't know because she has us. 
 The Riley committee. 
 The committee exists to keep certain information away from Riley. 
 Like what? 
 Everything, really. 
 Listen, this committee can't protect her for the rest of her life. 
 She's getting too smart. 
 She's looking for a bird. 
 Well, someone's gotta tell her. 
 You do it. 
 Nah... 
 You do it! 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 Peaches. 
 See, we've all been protecting you from something. 
 You know Pluto? 
 Pluto? I love Pluto. 
 Everybody knows that. 
 Pluto's a little cutie-pie. 
 The smallest planet with the biggest heart. 
 I love Pluto so much, I would kiss it on the face. 
 Not doing it! 
 You're doing it! 
 Honey? 
 Peaches? 
 Pluto is not a planet anymore. 
 What's that you say? 
 They made a scientific discovery that Pluto's not a planet anymore. 
 Will you be okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I am too old now to flip out over something like that. 
 Dad, please continue. 
 You sure, sweetie? 
 Please, continue. 
 Okay. 
 All right, guys. 
 So, we're talking about who we are now, and who we hope to be someday. 
 How will we write our own history and decide what's important to us? 
 They found a 100-year-old time capsule in Boston last week. 
 Could we do one of those? 
 I love that idea, Farkle. 
 In fact, we did one of those when I was in high school. 
 We were gonna see what became of us in 15 years. 
 Wait a minute... We were gonna see what became of us right now! 
 15 years is right now. 
 We were gonna go back and see how much we've changed. 
 Yeah, well, I hope some of us never do.

 Promise me we are not driving to Philadelphia to dig up stuff from 15 years ago. 
 I promise. 
 Where are the shovels for something else? 
 We don't have shovels. 
 Well, where would one buy these shovels? 
 The hardware store, if one was going to buy shovels, but one isn't. 
 Well, where would one find this "hardware store" if one was? 
 Promise me you're not coming back here with shovels. 
 I promise you I am not coming back here with shovels. 
 Then where are you going? 
 I think you know. 
 Say it! 
 Shovels! 
 How can they just do that? 
 She works her whole life to become a planet, and then it's just taken away from her. 
 Do our hopes and dreams even matter? 
 Well, in 15 years, we're gonna find out. 
 A buffalo nickel. That's what you're putting in the time capsule? 
 Yeah, my grandfather gave it to me for... anyway, my grandfather gave it to me. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, for what? 
 Pappy Joe gave it to you for what? 
 Don't call his grandfather pappy Joe. 
 It actually was pappy Joe. 
 You knew that? 
 Eh, it would've been anything I said. 
 Why'd he give you the nickel? Why? 
 Nothing. He gave it to me for being a good little boy. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, tell us. 
 I was a little kid, I want to a kiddie rodeo, and I was the only one who made it the whole eight seconds. 
 You rode a bull? 
 It was sort of like a bull. 
 Here comes funny. 
 I rode a sheep. 
 (Laughing) 
 It's a real thing! It's called mutton busting. 
 Riley, you're laughing at me? 
 No... 
 I wanted to be a rodeo star. 
 But, I got older and gave up on it. 
 Aww, don't ever give up on your sheep riding dreams. 
 You go out there, and you become the best sheep rider the world has ever seen. 
 Mom, what are you doing? 
 As long as I'm here, I've decided to give out valuable life-living advice. 
 Like Cory and Topanga. 
 So, you all come to me when you're feeling lost in this world, and I'm gonna fix you right up. 
 Nah, we're good. 
 Do not let your sheep-riding disappointment prevent you from dreaming dreams. 
 As I look back at my life, the only regrets I have are the dreams I gave up on too soon. 
 Wow. Thank you. That's good advice. 
 Yes, it is! 
 Hey, nice trophy, the Farkle. 
 Thanks, the Maya's mom. 
 It's my science fair lifetime achievement award. 
 Forget science, you dream dreams! 
 But... 
 Okay. 
 What are you putting in, Maya? 
 Nothing. No hopes, no disappointments. 
 What about you? 
 I don't know why it's so important for me to care about something that's so far away. 
 But, I do. 
 I'm putting in Pluto. 
 Well, it's small enough. Ha! 
 Too soon? 
 Back from the hardware store, are we? 
 Shovel. 
 Hmm... 
 Please tell me you didn't drag Shawn into this? 
 I did not drag Shawn into this. 
 (Banging on the door) 
 Who's that? 
 I think you know. 
 Topanga, you all right? 
 Yeah, I'm fine, Shawn. 
 Oh, then it's Cory. Oh my gosh, it's you. 
 All right. What do the doctors say? 
 How long does he have to live? 
 Not long. 
 All right, buddy. 
 We are gonna do everything we've ever dreamed of, and in whatever time you have left, we're gonna do everything. 
 We're gonna go to your favorite restaurant, we're gonna take all the rolls. 
 They want you to take the rolls. 
 No! 
 Oh, it's okay, Shawn, I bought the shovels myself. 
 Cory, pay the money. Have the professionals dig. 
 Shawn, he's fine. Everybody's fine. 
 No. He's not fine. 
 He called me over here, said it was a matter of life or death. 
 He's not fine. 
 I had to make sure you'd come. 
 Nobody bye-bye? 
 Everybody whoop-di-whoo! 
 Why am I here? 
 Cory remembered the time capsule from high school. 
 It's 15 years. 
 He wants to drive to Philadelphia to dig it up. 
 Oh... 
 Okay. 
 Whatcha doing with that shovel, buddy? 
 I was in Philadelphia! 
 (Yelling) 
 Road trip! 
 Who wants to go instead of me? 
 I'll go. I'll do anything with anybody. 
 No deal. 
 There's not enough room in the car for you and all your words. 
 What's this here? 
 This is what we're putting in our time capsule. 
 Oh... 
 Nope. Not good enough. 
 These things are important to us. 
 Why are there only three of them? 
 I'm not playing. 
 Oh, you're playing! 
 Nice shovel shirt. 
 They got plenty left. 
 I don't see how. 
 Mr. Shawn. 
 Miss Katy. 
 How are you? How's the writing? 
 Well, I was doing a story in Philadelphia till my friend here brought me to New York so we could go back to Philadelphia. 
 How's the acting? 
 I was playing a waitress at the nighthawk diner, and now I'm playing a waitress here. 
 It's your real life. 
 It can't be. 
 Well, I'm kinda liking this movie. 
 Come on! It's a chance to go back and see what time has taught us. 
 Come on, it's our history! 
 You and me, Feeny, Shawn and Angela. 
 Give me a shovel. No reason. 
 Give me a shovel and your head. 
 Who's Angela? 
 Oh, you know. Someone who used to be in my life. 
 Ah, yes. Well, we all have one of those, don't we? 
 Do you miss her? 
 I know I'd miss Riley and Maya if I didn't see them for a long time. 
 Do you think your old feelings will get all stirred up for her? 
 And you'll miss her? And you'll go back and live wherever she is? 
 Do you never miss? 
 Yeah, Mr. hunter, you gonna get some feelings all stirred up? 
 Maya, all of a sudden, I think we should be going with them. 
 Do you think we should go? 
 We're going with you. 
 All right. 
 Katy, do you mind if we take this one off your hands for the weekend? 
 Have fun, baby girl. 
 All right, girls, grab a shovel. 
 We're digging up the past! 
 Yay. 
 
 
 
 Come on, Topanga! Put some back into it, will you? 
 (Whispering) I have blisters! 
 And, it's not exactly like I'm wearing my shoveling shoes. 
 What about you guys? 
 We're on a mandatory break. 
 Hey, I thought we were only doing every other hole. 
 You said you knew exactly where this thing was buried. 
 Well, it's in this general vicinity, yes. 
 How is this fun? 
 You said this was gonna be fun. How can anybody make this fun? 
 I made one for Maya's head. 
 You're supposed to be digging. 
 Oh, but I was digging for an hour, and all I found was this old metal box. 
 Cory... 
 What? 
 I'm concerned. 
 What's there to be concerned about, Shawnie? 
 That. 
 (Gasping) 
 Mr. Matthews. 
 Mr. hunter. 
 We meet again. 
 Detention? 
 Big boy detention. 
 I won't do well in big boy detention. 
 Feeny! 
 Fee-hee-hee-hee-heenay! 
 What, what, what, what... 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey... 
 (Hissing like cats) 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Mrs. Matthews. 
 How you doing? 
 Put back my flowers. 
 Except for those. 
 I'll attend to those myself. 
 Excuse me. 
 Is he a good father, you poor, poor, little girl? 
 I'm very lucky. 
 Hmm. 
 Is he a good teacher? 
 I think he's the best there is. 
 Oh. 
 But, he says you are. 
 Oh. 
 And that's what you were digging for? 
 It's our time capsule, remember? 
 I remember everything. 
 We wanna see how time treated us. 
 If we turned out like we hoped we would. 
 Got any advice for us while we're all out here together, Mr. Feeny? 
 Well, yes. 
 It's been a long time, and you're still together. 
 What else do you need to know? 
 All right, I'll go first. 
 Now, no one knows what anyone else buried, right? 
 Yeah, that was the deal. 
 Don't open it. 
 Yeah, wouldn't you rather believe your lives are perfect? 
 You make a good point, girls, you do. 
 But, here's another point. 
 Have you even met me? 
 There it is. 
 It's the jean jacket. 
 It's the first time we said "I love you." 
 And it still fits. 
 Time has been good to you, Topanga. 
 Time has been good to us all. 
 And that's how you do the time capsule! 
 Okay, your turn. 
 Okay, don't overreact. 
 Why would I overreact? 
 Because I know you're going to misinterpret this. 
 Let's see. 
 "Dear Cory, if you would let it happen, I think you and I could have a future." 
 Topanga, what's wrong with this? This is great. 
 It's not from her. 
 Aah! 
 It's from Lauren. 
 Who's Lauren? 
 Well, before we got married, your father met a girl at a ski lodge, and she really liked him. 
 Matthews, you dog! 
 Is this why we never go skiing? 
 Why would you do this, Topanga? I... 
 I buried a symbol of our love. 
 Cory, I was threatened by this because I was young. 
 The jean jacket was the first time we said "I love you." 
 But, I almost let this little piece of paper hurt us because I was young. 
 You always knew, but I didn't understand that our love will last forever. 
 And that nothing could hurt it. 
 I buried this because I hoped that when we opened it, I would be sitting next to you, and that I could go like this. 
 Here goes. 
 All right, here goes. 
 Ah... 
 Shakespeare's sonnets. 
 Vivaldi's four seasons. A Van Damme movie ticket. And lip gloss. Kiwi mango. Ah, me and Angela. We were gonna be Cory and Topanga. I guess there can only be one Cory and Topanga. But, still... Me and Angela. I wonder what she's up to nowadays? Bye, Shawn. See, life works out better if you don't get your hopes up. Shawn will get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Pluto is not a planet anymore, and my mom and me are just my mom and me. Pluto is a planet. Sorry, Riley, but you're the only one who says it is. You heard them tell the story, Maya. There was a time when my father was the only one who knew he and my mother would always be together. Even when everyone else said that they wouldn't. He knew. And so do I. And so does your mother. Because she's right. Dream dreams, Maya. You're going to get everything you want in life. How is it possible that you can still have hope for me? Hey... I have hope for something four billion miles away. You have always been right here. I know that Angela and I used to just be able to sit together. We didn't even have to talk. You didn't talk? No. We'd just be with each other. Am I ever gonna find that again? Maybe you'll find something different? Yeah, is different better? Maybe, if you give it a chance. Shawn, why didn't you end up with Angela? She ended it and walked out on me. Time has taught me that's not good for a relationship. I put this stuff in the time capsule because I thought when we opened it there might be someone there for me to love. I'm not gonna have that. Don't be such a jerk! Women used to like me, right? (Knocking) Come in, Uncle Shawn. How'd you know it was me? My family doesn't knock. They're pigs. Okay. What? You know how they say Pluto isn't a planet anymore? Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Doesn't that kill you? No. Pluto is still out there for me. I don't care. You weren't afraid to love somebody once. Yeah, well, I... I'm done with that. I don't have that, I'm not going to have that. You are. There's someone out there for you. So, you're saying Pluto is Angela? No, I'm saying that Pluto is believing in something out there no matter what anybody says. Especially you. Because there is. How are you not getting this yet, buddy? You believe in me? I do. I don't know what I'm supposed to be for you. Can you just be out there for me? Yes. I can do that. I want to do that. What do you call that? It doesn't matter what you call it. I just wanna know that you're there. Okay. I'm there. Okay, I'll go first. You putting in your sheep nickel, Billy Bob? No, I changed my mind about that. I'm not putting in a reminder of when I gave up on a dream. Your transfer slip. I'd rather be reminded of when something good started. Me next. Your science fair trophy? Wasn't important enough for this. Your favorite orange turtleneck. It was the one I took off when I felt like I was nothing. But, you guys wouldn't let me be nothing. And since it's us that's gonna be together when we open this, I can't wait to see the something that I am. Riley, Pluto? Yeah. Still Pluto. Whenever we open this, I hope I haven't stopped believing in things. Okay, I'll play. But, you guys have to leave. Your parents and Shawn didn't tell each other what they were putting in, and that's the way I want to do it. I'm hoping we'll all be surprised. Hey. Whatever it is, I hope it works out the way you want it. Me too. Hope is for suckers. Hi, Shawn. Um, we're closing up, but I could get you something for the road? Uh, yeah, that'd be great. Actually, no. Feel like sitting down for a second? Yeah. No, I do. Yeah. Whew. Did you want to talk about something? We don't have to talk. We can just... sit here. Will that be okay? (Laughs) That was great. Now talk? Yeah, would that be better? Mm-hmm. It's certainly harder, but I found it can be, yeah. Lip gloss. Yeah, I put this on when I don't know what's happening. What flavor is that? Cinnamon spice. Is that better than kiwi mango? It's different. Is different better? Well, I guess that depends on the life you're having. For me, yeah, I'd take different. I'm ready for different. How about you? You hear they're talking about making Pluto a planet again? Yeah. How about that?
