 Why do we have to sneak out of the house if we're not doing anything wrong until we sneak onto the subway? 
 You think you're ready to just walk by your parents? 
 I think I'm ready. 
 Let me see your face as you walk by your parents. 
 "Why are you making that face at us, Riley?" 
 Because I'm sneaking onto the subway. 
 Out the window. 
 Let's go. 
 Daddy, what are you doing here? 
 Being smarter than me. How come you're always smarter than me? 
 Here's what I'm thinking. 
 It's not your world yet. It's still my world. 
 Because if it was your world, Maya would have you on the subway already, thinking you put something over on me. But you didn't. 
 Know how I know? Look at ya. 
 You're right here. 
 How long do I have to live in my father's world? 
 Until you make it yours. 
 Riley, do you know what I want more than anything? 
 Go ahead, make it yours. 
 I will. And when I do will you still be there for me? 
 Topanga : Right here. 
 We'll be right here. 
 (Theme music playing) 
 (Busker drumming) 
 Weasel! 
 Maya! 
 Who's the new chick? 
 "Chick"! 
 Down here I'm a chick. 
 No wonder my parents don't want me on the subway. 
 You're slouching, Maya. 
 Thanks, Gretchen. 
 (Drumming continues) 
 Whoa, Riley. You don't do lip gloss. 
 Oh, what I forgot to mention is that I'm completely reinventing myself. 
 I ride the subway now, I have kiwi lips now and I'm just as cool as you now. 
 Yeah? Let's see how cool you can be when you look at him. 
 (Giggles) 
 Yeah, you're gonna need some lessons. 
 Okay, let me show you everything you need to know about boys and girls. 
 Hi, I'm Maya. You're really cute. 
 We should hang out sometime. You make me happy. 
 You don't pay enough attention to me. This isn't working out. 
 It's you, not me. We can still be friends. Not really. 
 He's available. We just broke up. 
 Are you okay? Do we need to talk about it? 
 You still want to be like me? 
 I want to be exactly like you. 
 I think too much and you don't think at all. 
 See, you get me. So let's not think. 
 (Screams) 
 Hi. 
 We were just talking about you. 
 You used to go out with my friend Maya. 
 I'm Lucas. 
 I love it. 
 Perhaps someone would like to give their seat to someone older? 
 Oh, not you, sweet potato pie. 
 Please don't make me move. 
 I just want to see where this goes. 
 I've just worked a 12-hour shift and I just want to see where this goes. 
 Mmm-kay? 
 Mmm-kay. 
 That was great. 
 You're welcome. 
 What if that was the best moment of my life? 
 What if nothing ever happens for me again? 
 (Screams) 
 It's for you.

♪ I'm singing "go-o-o." ♪ Did you have trouble with the homework? Piece of cake. You didn't do it, did you? I don't even know where my books are. They're here and they're heavy. (Bell rings) You have to do the homework, Maya. This teacher's insane, a total nutjob. I think there's something seriously wrong with him. Hi, honey. Hi, daddy. You're late to your father's class. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Matthews. You wrote her a note. I did? He did. You did. "Riley is late. Deal with it." Well, you got my signature down pretty good this time. Oh, it was easy. You write like a girl. Okay, let me get back to jamming some learning into your heads. The civil war. The civil bore. Thank you, future minimart employee of the month. Would I be making more money than you? The civil war! Anybody? A war we fought against ourselves. What, you actually studied it? No, I'm actually living it. People, people, are we here to learn or not? What do you mean, Farkle? I've been in love with Riley since the first grade. But I'm also equally in love with Maya. Some might say the great mystery of the universe is who's gonna be the first Mrs. Farkle. You don't want this. Bring it on. I always thought he'd wind up with back-of-the-class Brenda. Ew, yuck! Actually, the great mystery of the universe is how you could love two women the same who couldn't possibly be more different. We're not so different. May I overstep my bounds, sir? You always do. Riley is the sun, warm and bright and lights up my whole day. Maya is the night, dark and mysterious. And the night has always been a mystery to me. Because I go to bed at 7:30. How could I love these two different women? How could I not? Thank you! I am Farkle! So we were indeed trying to find out who we were as a people. Who am I? What should I be? History shows that bad things happen when you don't know who you are. Who are you? I don't know who you are. Subway boy. I'm Lucas Friar from Austin, Texas. Oh, new student, Mr. Friar? Yes sir. Great, you're just in time for today's assignment. Have a seat. Okay, so we... So I'd like you guys to open your books to page 48. Now I'd like you to turn to page one. Now I'd like you to read from page one to 48. (Kids groan) Oh, too bad on you. Okay, so for tonight's assignment, I'd like you to write me a three-page essay on anything... Anything at all that you guys believe in so strongly you'd fight for it. That! I'd fight for no homework. I come here every day. Why can't you teach me everything I need to know while I'm here? Whoo! Not Whoo. He gets our days. Let's take back our nights. No homework, more freedom. Who's with me? (Chanting) No homework, more freedom. No homework, more freedom. No homework, more freedom... This is it, kid. You want to be like me? Stand up. No homework, more freedom. Whatcha doing? I'm making a choice about who I want to be, about whose world I want it to be. Riley, I know you. You know exactly who you are. Who am I, Dad? You're just like me. Yeah? Would you do this? No homework, more freedom. Farkle, are you with us or not? No homework, more freedom. No homework, more freedom... My education or my women? My education or my women? My education or my women? Oh, it's happening again, sir. ♪ I'm singing go-o-o." ♪ Ma! Ma! Whatever this is, do not put me in the middle of the two people that I love equally. Just kidding, c'mere, honey. My teacher followed me home. Can we keep him, can we keep him? Please say no! She walked out of my class. She's trying to be Maya. Why would you want to be Maya? She's cool. She has a wild side. She does what she wants. But you're such a good person. Who cares about that? Do you really think I'm one of those girls who follows all of the rules and never gets into trouble? I was hoping. You think I'm well-raised. Half. How important is it that you don't know me at all? "Let's get married!" "Let's have a kid!" "Let's have another kid!" Well, you listened to me, you big stupid! Am I the type of person who always plays it safe? Is this who I'm going to be for the rest of my life? Am I ever going to take a risk that changes my destiny? Do birds know how to smile? Why is cake always so delicious? Will my drawings ever get any better? Are you making fun of me? No, I think just like you because we're twins. We're not twins. Ma-aaaa! Aww, look at him looking for a place to fit in. Do you think he'll sit with us? Ladies. Both : Farkle! Interesting lunch-line dilemma: Sloppy Joe or chicken pot pie? Or sloppy Joe? Or chicken pot pie? Is that all you got? That's it. Same time tomorrow. There he is. Invite him to sit down. With words? You're ready for this. - What do I say? "Hey, Lucas, looking for somebody special?" I can't say that. "Hey, Lucas, looking for somebody?" Too forward. "Hey, Lucas." Like we're on a first-name basis? "Hey." 
 
 Hey. Hey back. Hi. You're sitting here. Is that okay? Can you excuse me for just one sec? (Squeals) How ya doing? Dad, you have a choice here. You can either understand that this is just a boy talking to me in the cafeteria... I'm gonna do whatever you say next. But this is so innocent. Honey, fathers don't see anything as innocent. We see it as... What's the opposite of innocent? Right here. Please don't embarrass me. I'm just going to talk to Mr. Friar about geography. You know, I've been to a lot of places. Never been to Texas, though. What part of Texas is closest to Mexico? - That'd be El Paso, sir. Great. Let's go right now. So... did you do the homework? No, I didn't do the homework. The question on everybody's kiwi lips is did you do the homework? No. I'm one of the founding members of the homework rebellion. You think I did my homework? I think you did mine too. I did, I did and I really liked it. Riley, don't save me. What? Let me be me. Oh, you got two desserts? Angel's food cake. And devil's food cake. Let me guess who's who. Hey, Farkle's just hungry. Not everything is about you. Hi, I'm glad you're back. Hi, me too. Hi. Apparently you have a better sense of direction than I anticipated. You are a really good-looking guy. Okay, so... Today we're gonna find out if anybody here believes in something so strongly they'd fight for it. Maya. Yes sir. Present your homework. Can't do that, sir. Why not? - I didn't do my homework, sir. Why not? - That's what I'm fighting against, sir. Oh, this could go on for a while. Farkle Farkle Farkle Farkle. (Snores) Farkle Farkle Farkle. I didn't do my homework either. Oh really? Yeah. We're the same now. I don't believe in homework. Guess what, Riley? That doesn't make you the same as Maya at all. I have something to say. Wow, I don't know what to do. I've never seen this before. The floor is yours, Ms. Hart. Get up, Farkle. You're gonna want to be awake for this. Is it our honeymoon? No, you missed that. Now it's time to hand in our essays. Oh, Farkle goes first. Farkle always goes first! All right, everybody who did their homework, put it on your desks. Careful there, Ms. Hart. Are you sure about this? I got this. Okay. The burning of Atlanta led to the end of the civil war and to peace. I believe that peace is worth fighting for. Hey, that's a pivotal part of my diorama! And there goes Virginia. The burning of the homework led to the end of the homework rebellion... because there was no more homework. All right, all right, that's far enough, Maya. I get it. No homework, more freedom! (Spurts) (Screams) (Alarm ringing) Okay, so those work. Is this still part of your presentation or is this actually going on? Why didn't you stop your friend? It's not what I do anymore. You're better than that. I'm just letting her be her. Ms. Hart, you have detention. The principal will determine if it goes further than that. Ms. Matthews, please leave. I deserve detention too. No, you don't. You didn't do anything. And because you didn't do anything, your best friend is in very deep trouble. All right, Farkle, you can get down now. Well, you're actually quite comfortable, sir. Thank you, Farkle. Get off! Farkle isn't going anywhere! Down, Farkle. You're looking at us pretty hard there, Mr. Matthews. I just want to stand by my girl. You missed the moment to stand by your girl. You were so busy trying to be her, Riley, you forgot the best thing you can do for her is be you. Riley, take Farkle for a walk. Listen, for as long as I can remember, it's always been Riley and Maya. Now I always believed a friend helps another friend out of trouble, not into it. I'm sorry. I am too. Because you go too far. Do you understand me? I have nobody at home who helps me with my homework. Riles? Yeah? If we can't hang out with each other as much anymore, don't worry about it. Wait. Why wouldn't we... He's going to make you end the friendship. He said that? He's really upset with me. He loves you. I don't think so anymore. I just want you to know that I get it wouldn't be your fault. (Laughs) Beyootiful! You two little bumblebees got a sweet thing going. But where's your hunk? You ain't got no hunk, you ain't got no story! I haven't been your good friend. You're my best friend. She's your best friend! Best friends are important. I got a best friend. I'm not talking to her right now. I go too far. And I don't think that's gonna stop. I'm bad for you. Did he say that? He will. This is your stop. Don't be me. You don't go as far as me. No. No. No! Do not push her off this train! You do not push your best friend off the train. I'm not you. That little girl pushed those doors open with the power of love. You are not allowed to abandon our friendship! I would never do that. Riley, I'm pushing you away because I'm not good for you anymore. Only I decide that! You know why? Why? Because if this is my world now, the first person I want in it is you. You're gonna save me, aren't you? I am. Where is he? There is no way I'm gonna let you break-up my friendship with Maya! Is that what you think I want, Riley? No. What you said you really want is for me to make the world my own. And you want me to do my homework. Well, I'm doing it right now. Here's what I think is worth fighting for: This is my best friend. She's gonna get me into trouble and I'm gonna get us out of it. And I did. Because here we are. Look at us, Dad. We're right here. My civil war is over, Dad. I won. What happens now? Friends, family... and all you other subterranean mole people... we're here today to celebrate Riley being Riley. Now some may call this a New York City subway pass. But you, Riley, can consider this a ticket to the world. You think I'm ready? You showed us you are. Riley, I've already met the world. It's your turn. Hey, this isn't so different from Texas. Look, there's a pony. That's a rat. Ladies. Farkle. So where do you wanna go? Don't know. Big world. Ours now? Yeah, but my Dad did say I have to be home by 5:00. Don't worry, he wrote you a note. Conductor : Next stop, Astor Place, 14th street... And the world. You guys came back and waited for us? Hey, we told you we were always gonna be here for you. Yeah, Riley. It's not so easy handing over the world without making sure everything's going to be okay. Well done, Mr. Matthews.
