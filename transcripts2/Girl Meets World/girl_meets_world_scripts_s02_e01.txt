 Riley Matthews from Greenwich village, New York City, the United States of America, the continent of North America, Western hemisphere, the Earth, the solar system, the universe. 
 The mind of God. 
 And in the middle of all of it, is John Quincy Adams Middle School, me and my friends, because we are the center of the universe. 
 At least, that's what I thought. 
 Who's ready for a brand new year? 
 Why are you still in bed? 
 Is he gonna be my teacher? 
 No. We are not doing that again. 
 That was crazy. New year, new teacher, get excited, because you and your friends are the kings of middle school now. 
 First day of the new year! 
 Why are you still in bed? 
 Are you gonna be my teacher? 
 No! Your mother and I went through that with Mr. Feeny. 
 Yeah, our teacher from sixth grade to college. 
 How could that happen? 
 In an unexpected... 
 But completely believable way... 
 Every year. 
 (Mouths) 
 What up, losers? 
 No, no, no! No doing that, girls. School! 
 Who's gonna be my teacher? 
 Your teacher? Whoever loses. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I'm telling you, girls, I'm gonna be teaching your lives to a whole new group of students! 
 Do you believe him? 
 I can't even believe we're starting off the new year without first talking about how when we were on the subway and you took Lucas by the face... 
 (Laughs) 
 We... are not talking about that! 
 We're kings. 
 We're kings, Matthews. 
 You don't get to tell us what to do anymore. 
 Get out. 
 Okay, but that was the last one. 
 Dad, you have to let us learn how to walk through life on our own two feet. 
 Hmm, you think they'll be back? 
 No, I think they're gonna go with this. 
 Maya and Riley: Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. 
 Ah. 
 Hello! It is us, the kings. 
 Hey, look at your feet. They're naked! 
 Eyes up here, buddy. 
 Hey, Riley, your dad gonna be our teacher again this year? 
 He said he's not. 
 I'll believe it when I don't see it. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 All summer. 
 Hey. 
 You have to talk about it. 
 She's right. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, hey. 
 (Bell rings) 
 Glad we talked about it. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Bye. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I know it's gonna be my father. 
 I can't look. 
 Scared. 
 (Sighs) Okay. 
 Ready? 
 Quick peek. 
 One, two, three, go. 
 Did you see what I saw? 
 Oh yeah. 
 Then why are we covering our eyes? 
 Because it's gonna go away, I don't want it to go away, and it's gonna go away. 
 Y-y-y-y-ay! 
 Thank you. Girls, take a seat. 
 Your seats. 
 Yeah, okay, let's get started. 
 Belgium, 1831. 
 Y-y-y-y-ay! 
 This is gonna be our best year ever. 
 Let's just get up, go over, and look at him up close. 
 Yes? 
 He said, "yes." 
 What do we do now? 
 I'm gonna touch him on the face. 
 Sit down! 
 You two strike me as a couple of girls who are used to special treatment. 
 I don't know who your last teacher was, but I don't do that. 
 Farkle time, sir? 
 Go ahead, kid. You gotta Farkle, you gotta Farkle. 
 No, this is where he takes over the class. 
 Oh. He takes over the class, you just talk without raising your hand, and these two just do whatever they want? 
 Yes? 
 Pretty much, yeah. 
 You know what? I wanted to make a difference. 
 I wanted to shape young minds. 
 I wanted to dedicate my entire life to being an influential person who commands respect! 
 I quit! 
 What happens now? 
 You did this!

The other guy wouldn't give me Farkle time. Yeah, he didn't like it at all when we talked. It's true. It was like he wanted to talk all the time. I don't think he knew that history class is supposed to be about our lives. Galileo. Everyone believed that the sun revolved around the earth... Except for him. Everyone thought they were the center of the universe and that everything else circled around them. I know somebody who circles around me... Little too closely. Is that what you think's happening here, Riley? We're in the eighth grade now. We're a year older. We should be able to head off and explore without you. Okay. And you guys think you're ready? Born ready. I'll get there! You know what we're gonna do, Matthews? We're gonna transfer out of here. Yeah! Yeah? Yeah! Lucas? Farkle? I don't think so, Riley. I really like him. I like the way he teaches us, I like how we're talking right now, and he doesn't stop us when he could if he wanted to. (Chuckles) Wait. Why don't you stop us? Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it? Well, we're done with you. Thanks for the lessons. Buy yourself something pretty. Thank you. Oh, you're gonna need transfer slips. I knew it. He's gonna keep us here on a technicality. Go ahead. Beat it. Look at us, riles... two young, independent women taking their own road, making their own way with their guts and their brains. Needing nothing from nobody from this moment on! Here comes funny. Riley and Maya: Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. We think we're the center of the universe. We think everything revolves around us. We depend on the sun for light, for warmth every morning, every day. And when it's gone... We sleep... Trusting that in the morning, it will always come back again. Auggie. Oh, Topanga. I'm dropping off your helper for the day. Oh, good, big, strong man. That's me! Mrs. Svorski used to attract all the big, strong men. You know what happened? What? No, I'm asking. (Laughs) Okay. Oh, Topanga. Yeah? We need talk. You need to spend more time here. Well, Mrs. Svorski, how can I do that? Mrs. Svorski, tell me the joke. You quit shark lawyer job, and you help turn this old-world place into place for young people. But, this place has been here for so long! Is too long, creaky. Is tired. Knows time is up. Ding! (Laughs) How can a bakery know that it's time is up? It knows. You my partner. You bring new life. I need you here. Mrs. Svorski! Tell me the joke! Okay. Is not Ukrainian bakery. Is my-krainian bakery. (Laughing) It's not funny any more. I know. You think I need little pootchkie like you to tell me joke isn't funny? In old country, I had variety show. It was called Mrs. Svorski's not so happy hour. Can you make it funny for me again? Can you tell your mommy world is changing, bakery need to change, too. Mommy, do it. (Chuckles) 
 
 But, this place is so charming. It's so... you. Yeah, people come, people go. Reminds me of song I sang at end of variety show. Oh, here we go. ♪ Make new friends, treat them right ♪ 
♪ 'cause you never know who is spy ♪ Okay, how's this? I'm gonna spend a little more time here and I'll also try to find someone to help you out. Also, you change name of place. What? No, this place will always be Svorski's. No such thing as "always." Now place Svorski's, soon place Topanga's. World keep turning. Life go to next people. This has always been good idea. Transfer slip! Poom! And poom! Greetings, new classmates. Riley Matthews. Ready to be your friend. 'Sup? I'm Maya. You don't look me in the eyes. You two are late. You two don't talk. You two sit there and there. There and there? (Chuckles) No, no, we sit together... In the middle of everything. Move! (Yelps) Bye-bye. (Sobs) Excuse me. Were you two trying to have a moment? You two don't get a moment. This is not the you two show. We were told it was. During the gold rush, people left the comfort of their own surroundings in the hope of finding greater riches in an inhospitable land. Excuse me. I will not warn you again, side-person! (Gasps) You tell her, mom. You failed me. Ha! I saw a goat give birth. Hi. Hi. Wait a minute! Students number six and seven! That's us? I believe so. Students number six and seven? Hey, at least she's talking to us. Yes? Get out! Fine! Well, at least we get a dramatic exit! (Footsteps in unison) Oh, come on! Here's what's funny. If you're standing on the moon, you'd think the earth was revolving around you, instead of the other way around. It's really all about perspective. It's hard not to believe that you're the center of everything... Until something shows you you're not. Our town, by Thornton Wilder. My favorite play. You can't teach English. It's all about the history... There you go. ...of people just like you and me, mostly about not taking what we have for granted, and a girl who gets a chance to take one look at the life she left behind. "Just for a moment now we're all together. "Just for a moment we're happy. "Let's really look at one another." Hello, girls. You're back? Yes. As bad as this is... Everything else is worse. Well, welcome back, ladies. You're just in time for today's lesson. Did we miss anything? Nah. We're just putting everything back in place. The real lesson begins right... (Snaps) Now. (Sighs) Face it, we are never going to escape him. He's everywhere. How are we going to be kings of anything if everywhere we go... We might run into my... mom? What are you doing here? Is my-krainian bakery. Still not funny. Not funny? I'll tell you what's not funny. This place loses $1.50 on every bulochki. I bake with love. How can you put price on love? (Chuckles) Watch me. Ooh! Ka-ching! Bakery window. Bakery window right now. (Laughing) That's nice. So, your dad's at school, your mom's at our hangout. That's nice. You're laughing at me? Inside, I'm crying so hard. Auggie, this is for you. Is flour shaker from Ukraine. Antique, like me. You take now. You are little Baker. What should I do with it? Keep safe, treasure always. Very important what in there. Thank you, Mrs. Svorski. Thank you, Mrs. Svorski. Oh, thank you, Topanga... And Auggie. I can't escape them, Maya. My... my parents are constantly circling me... Like planets. Hello. Riley. (Chuckles) I haven't seen you in 20 minutes. Do you miss me? 'Cause I missed you. (Groans) Auggie, come here. I miss you too, bud. Mrs. Svorski. I have someone who I think can be the perfect manager for when I can't be at the bakery. This person know way around food game? Absolutely. She's also very colorful. She really gets into whatever she's doing. Sounds like good woman. Mmm. Oh! Sorry I'm late. (Ukrainian accent) My donkey died on way here. Oh. Smells like being back in kitchen in Ukraine. Waiting for Tato to come home, hoping he has not lost last finger in field mower. Oh no, no, he did. Oh, poor Tato. He can never win at "paper, rock, scissors." Always know rock is coming. One... Both : Two, three! Rock! I like her. Mom. Ohh... Mayabushka. (Normal voice) I am gonna be here all the time now, baby girl. How great is that? (Laughing) Mom... you can't be here. Dad, mom, you're everywhere. We just need some space. It's like you're circling around us. I'm sorry. You think we're circling around you? Yes. Oh. I see. So, I guess we're all done with the parenting? Yes, it seems we're all done with that part now. Good job, Topanga! Good job, Corey! Remember that whole potty-training thing that we did for her? And now she wants to leave? Oh, I loved every minute of that. Good times! So, you're okay with this? Oh yeah, we understand. You're a grownup. You know everything there is to know. Yup, you're ready to move away. Well, I mean, I'd like to stay in my own bedroom. Okay. You'll just drop us a line when you get married and have kids? (Scoffs) Mom, I just don't want you to be everywhere. Okay. Well, when you need us, we'll be at home. And I'll be back there, staying out of your way. Okay. Good. So, nobody feels bad about this? Well, let's see what happens. So, you are here now? I'm here now. Good. Ready? So... Here we are. Kings. The sun doesn't go around the earth. We're the ones moving. We orbit the sun, because we need it. We need its light and its heat, and if it wasn't there, we'd be dark and alone. I wasn't in Mrs. Svorski's orbit for very long, and I missed out on someone wonderful. My brother knew better. He was her very good friend. We think that we're the center of the universe, but the truth is... We need to circle the ones we love for as long as they're here. We need to hold them close, because no matter how far we travel, they are the ones who hold us in place. It's gravity, and without it, we would just all float away from each other. We are not kings at all. We are just... tiny little specks. My name is Riley Matthews from Greenwich Village, New York City, the United States of America, the continent of north America, the Western hemisphere, the Earth, the solar system, the universe, the mind of God. That's from our town, my father's favorite play. "Just for a moment we're all together. "Let's really look at one another." Good night, Mrs. Svorski. Good job, Riley. I know you're gonna miss her, buddy. She gave me her flour shaker. That's really nice. (Rattles) What's inside? It's a note. Maybe she wrote you a note. Mrs. Svorski's voice: Is not my-krainian bakery. I'm dead. (Laughing) I love you guys. (Clicks, ringing) (Ringing) (Beeps) Hello, Mr. Matthews. Hey, Mr. Feeny. You doing okay? Yes, Corey. I'm still here. Great. That's great.
