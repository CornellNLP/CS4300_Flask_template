 Previously on "Quantico"... 
 We're on lock-down, ma'am. 
 There's been an incident at the guard station. 
 Call your mom. 
 My parents are alive. 
 Look, I-I know. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Charlie may have helped plan the attack today. 
 It's time you tell me who Mark Raymond is. 
 What do you want to know? 
 We'll say everything that we need to say to each other and then never see each other again. 
 The Voice : In the Senator's purse is an identical bottle. 
 You'll need to swap it out. 
 I tried Natalie's cell. No response. 
 You were simply telling the truth. 
 Wow. 
 That is a lot to process. 
 Yeah. 
 The conspiracy goes back all the way to Quantico. 
 The terrorist... 
 We've been calling them the "Voice." 
 I thought it was someone from our class, but it could be... it could be anyone there. 
 What are you thinking? 
 About what? 
 How you lied to a Congressional committee when you said that Elias Harper acted alone? 
 Or the bomb that was strapped to Agent Vasquez to keep you in line. 
 Or maybe you want my thoughts on you sneaking Vasquez and that bomb into our office to steal classified Intel from an FBI server. 
 I mean, I hope there was nothing important on there besides, oh, I don't know, all the security measures for the upcoming presidential election. 
 I had no choice. 
 Ah, yes. 
 That convenient recurring line of anyone you say has been forced to work with this terrorist since it all began. 
 Elias Harper, the hacker Duncan Howell, Natalie... and how'd it turn out for them? 
 You yourself just informed me that this terrorist, with whom you apparently share a cellphone plan, detonated Agent Vasquez, threatened the life of everyone you say you care about, and tasked you into further tricking me to swap out the prescribed medication of a United States senator for something that you believe to be, but can't be certain, is harmless. 
 Did I... I leave anything out? 
 Nuance? 
 How can you be sure that these pills aren't dangerous? 
 Your lab analyzed them. 
 They're blood pressure medicine. 
 The only side effect is elevated body temperature. 
 And this terrorist said that if anyone else learned about what was going on, their lives would be in danger, too. 
 And yet you still told Simon and me. 
 [Laughs] I can't... 
 I can't figure you out, Parrish. 
 I mean [chuckles] you have no fear in having just admitted to a dozen federal crimes, not to mention if I look closely enough, accessory to murder, and if you're at all to be believed, you've just willingly hung a target on my back to save your own without compunction. 
 So, if you were me, would you believe a word you just said? 
 Hmm? 
 I don't know, Hannah. 
 What do you think? 
 Well, yeah, I believe you. [Scoffs] 
 And now I'm gonna go brief the Director. 
 [Norah Jones' "Happy Pills" plays] 
 Liam : I've been concerned about Parrish since the attack. 
 How's she doing in counseling? 
 She's strong... a survivor. 
 Built to be an agent, just like her father. 
 Drew Perales. 
 He's the one that shot the armed assailant. 
 Taking a life is never easy, but he doesn't seem to be affected by it. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How was the shrink? 
 Spent most of the session talking football. 
 She's a Lions fan. Can you believe that? 
 That's all you talked about? 
 Fletcher! You headed to breakfast? 
 Yes, but if the ladies start crowding our table again, you've got to share the love. Repeat after me... 
 "This is Brandon. His heart was recently broken. 
 Can you fix it?" [Laughs] 
 Woman : Shelby Wyatt's a bit of a question mark. 
 She was there when Perales took out the terrorist, but it doesn't seem to have made an impact.

 ♪ So pick up your piece and go away from here ♪ 
 Liam : Will Olsen. 
 He seems uncomfortable with the outpouring of emotion on campus. 
 He's burying himself in his work. 
 Dude, what did I tell you about studying before 9:00 a.m.? 
 Why are you reading that? 
 I already told you everything that you need to know. 
 No. You told me how you created an alter ego to sneak back in and how you promised them money in order to rise through the levels faster and how you're secretly working from within to take it all down, but there is so much more, like how they kidnap people and send them to farms in foreign countries or how their money comes from owning the patent to podcasting or how they believe that our skin is poisonous. 
 You think what I'm doing is crazy? 
 No, I think it's dangerous and cool. 
 And I'd love to talk about it for five to seven minutes. 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe later. 
 Liam : The Amin twins. 
 Man : We've put a pin in that. 
 They were in direct contact with the terrorists. 
 We can't discuss either sister publicly until OPR's investigation is over. 
 OPR... Office of Professional Responsibility. 
 They're gonna want statements from you both. 
 They already know that Raina was undercover at the cell's house. 
 They just don't know if you were there on your own or under orders from Miranda. 
 ♪ Got to get you out ♪ 
 Man : How's Miranda doing? 
 She's taking it day-by-day. 
 OPR's left messages, but she hasn't... 
 She shot her own son. 
 Well, she shouldn't have let it get to that point. 
 She's in trouble, Liam. 
 What's your assessment of the class overall? 
 It's one thing to tell a shrink that you're okay. 
 It's another thing to actually be okay. 
 Today's exercise will show me how they're really doing. 
 Hi. 
 Did you sleep well? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Um, about... last night... 
 And this morning. It was fun, right? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Um, but I just, um, want to make sure that we talk about everything else. 
 Do you mean my parents? 
 There's nothing really to talk about. 
 It's no different than before. 
 They were dead to me then. They're dead to me now. 
 Shelby, you can't mean that. 
 There are so many better ways to spend the next 10 minutes than discussing my parents. 
 [Giggles] 
 I don't know what to do. 
 It was an off-book operation, and I'm just a trainee. 
 If I tell them Miranda was involved, she'll be fired, and if I lie, I'll be kicked out. 
 Not many couples can say they've both been kicked out of the FBI. 
 Raina : It's not funny, and we're not a couple. 
 I just hate hearing you this upset. 
 Can I still see you this weekend? 
 I haven't seen you since New Year's. 
 I don't know. It's hard to get away. 
 It wouldn't be if you told your sister about us. 
 Simon... 
 I'll call you later. 
 We were all reminded of something last week. 
 Life can spin out of control at the drop of a hat. 
 You guys went through something harrowing, and you should be commended. 
 All of you. Not just Perales. 
 But here's the thing. 
 In the field, what you went through, that's called Monday. 
 And how you deal with it is the focus of today's exercise... crisis management. 
 As agents, you need to be able to keep your wits about you at all times. 
 You have to be able to confront the doubts and fears that live within all of us. 
 Because if you can't, you don't stand a chance against the bad guys. 
 So gather up your stuff. We're gonna go on a little trip. 
 [Sighs] Last time we spoke, I know things got a little heated, but I hope I can count on you. 
 For what? 
 Well, in the time of crisis, a group needs a leader, and you're that leader. 
 I didn't ask for that. 
 Yeah, well, a leader never does. 
 But if you care about your friends, you'll step up. 
 They're gonna need you today.

 First round's on you, rich boy. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Hannah, stop. If you tell the Director, someone else that I care about will die. 
 Okay. The FBI has a system for handling madmen. 
 It's called the chain of command. 
 This person's in the FBI. 
 The second you call the Director, they're gonna know. 
 Stop. 
 You're gambling with the lives of everyone I care about, including Ryan. 
 Okay. 
 I'll hold off telling the Director for 24 hours, but there's one condition, non-negotiable. 
 I'm in charge of the investigation. 
 Anything that happens from this point forward, my call. 
 Done. 
 Okay, so this plan clearly involves Claire Haas, so we need to stay on her, find out where she's going. 
 I'll get us put on that detail. 
 Thank you. 
 Since when do you and Alex have conversations that don't end in screaming? 
 You up to something? 
 Yeah, like trying to get her kicked out of the Bureau once and for all. 
 That shouldn't be too hard after that crap she pulled yesterday. 
 And me stupidly believing she changed. 
 I wish I could help, but I have a meeting with the Secret Service. 
 Haas' team just changed her itinerary. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I guess she lost some ground in the Midwest, so she's making a last-minute trip to Ohio tonight.

 The terrorist had me give Claire a three-day supply of pills, right? 
 Yesterday, today, and tomorrow? 
 Right.

 Simon, you see anything? 
 Besides Andrew Holm failing a take-home midterm? 
 Nope. 
 Look, thanks again for the facial recognition access codes. 
 No problem. All right. Stay sharp, people.

 Senator Haas? 
 May I have some water?

 Pollard : This drill is simple.

 By the time this plane's on the ground, we'll all be dead. 
 No, that is not true. 
 We're gonna save you. Everyone can live this time. 
 I promise you. You have my word. Please. 
 Wyatt. 
 Please do not let go. Okay? 
 We can... We can all make it this time. 
 Shelby. 
 God. 
 I'm sorry. You lost. 
 Then we go again. 
 Alex. 
 We go again and again until we win. 
 Shelby : Alex, I'm done. 
 What, you don't want to win? 
 There is no winning. 
 They're just gonna come up with another way for us to lose. 
 Isn't that right, Liam? 
 Yes. 
 This is what's called a lose-lose situation... an unwinnable scenario. 
 A Kobayashi Maru. 
 Exactly. 
 It's a situation you will encounter in the field and you need to be able to recognize it so you know you have no choice. 
 I know it seems maddening. 
 Sometimes, the only answer is that there is no answer. 
 Sometimes the plane just has to go down. 
 You're dismissed. 
 Shelby. Shelby, stop. 
 Liam. 
 Liam! 
 You want me to be a leader, then let me be the one to tell you this. 
 That was cruel and unusual, even for you. 
 Shelby's parents died on a plane. 
 You made her relive it over and over again? For what? 
 It's a lesson every NAT has to learn, regardless of history. 
 Remember the HRT drill Week 4? 
 If you hadn't made it through, you might not be here now lecturing me on how to do my job. 
 Yeah, well, we both know if you'd had your way, I wouldn't be here right now. 
 I asked you to take a leadership role in a time of crisis. 
 Don't blame me because it didn't go well. 
 You can learn from this, too. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay. 
 So what don't I know about Shelby? 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Crowd screaming] 
 FBI! Do not move, ma'am. 
 No. No, stop! Wait! I'm FBI. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 You have the right to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's okay. You didn't know. 
 Just like I didn't know. 
 For 15 years, I imagined myself on that plane. 
 I wondered what it was like for my parents. 
 I wondered about the chain of events. 
 When... When they knew about the hijackers and if they tried to subdue them. 
 When they realized that the plane was going down. 
 And the worst part of it is I talked about it. 
 I-I gave speeches. I-I hugged other survivors. 
 This is a huge part of who I am, and it's all been a lie. 
 Every last word. 
 My parents made me do that. 
 And why? 'Cause... 
 [Voice breaking] 'Cause they wanted to get away from me? 
 They left me behind. 
 No. 
 Who leaves their teenage daughter without saying a word? 
 And what... what could I have done that was so bad that they had... 
 No, no, no. 
 No. 
 They left me, Alex. 
 [Sniffles] 
 What if... 
 [Sobs] 
 What if there was a reason, you know? 
 A reason that they needed you to think that they died? 
 My mom lied to me for years about my father. 
 I mean, I wish she didn't, but she did. 
 And she did it to protect me. 
 What if they did it to protect you, too? 
 Don't assume the worst. 
 Now that you know, find out more. 
 You deserve to know the truth. 
 [Sighs] 
 This isn't just about Shelby Wyatt. 
 Hey, man, I don't... I don't want to talk about this. 
 You know, I-I already told you that. 
 Well, if you want to take down Sistemics, there are other ways. 
 Tell me why you're after them. Let me help. 
 I'm on a rescue mission. 
 Who are you trying to rescue? 
 Ross Edwards. 
 He's my best friend. 
 We joined together, and then a few months after, my dad pulled me out. 
 Ross tried to leave, too, but they wouldn't let him. 
 Nobody ever heard from him again. 
 He just disappeared. 
 You don't understand what Sistemics will do to hold on to a person. 
 So I need to find him. 
 I need to get him out if he's even still alive. 
 And in order to do that, I have to meet with the head of the church, and it's hopeless if that's Dan Berlin 'cause he'll know that I'm me and then... 
 Then he'll just throw me right out. 
 This doesn't have to be your Kobayashi Maru. 
 There's another way. 
 [Door opens] 
 Nimah : Hey. 
 [Sighs] 
 You want to talk? 
 You don't want to talk. You want to lecture. 
 That's not fair. 
 But it's true. 
 We don't match, Nimah... not anymore. 
 You're mad about Charlie? 
 Yes. 
 I am. 
 Because if you hadn't blown my cover, Charlie would be home safe with his mother now. 
 The woman who recruited us trusted us... the woman you want to abandon. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I never wanted to abandon her. 
 But if you lie, you won't help her, either. 
 If they catch you, everything that Miranda wanted for us... the mission... will disappear. 
 How can there be a mission if you don't trust me? 
 How can I trust you if you lie? 
 You never used to lie before. 
 I lied about the cell because I wanted to protect you. 
 I didn't want anyone to get hurt. 
 And I didn't go home during holidays. 
 I went to see Simon Asher. 
 Simon? 
 Yes. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Pollard : Trainee Amin, let's go. 
 It's time for my statement. 
 Hannah : I'm being benched. 
 Suspended from active duty till further notice. 
 Plus mandatory counseling. 
 I'm so sorry. I... 
 I can't let you take the blame for this. 
 Let... Let me go talk to them. 
 Maybe I can convince them to go easy on you. I... 
 They did. 
 I'm lucky I'm not being brought up on charges. 
 Trust me. This is better. 
 Why didn't you just tell them the truth, Hannah? 
 You were gonna go to the Director in 24 hours anyway. 
 I thought about it. I did. 
 But I don't know. 
 As I sat in that room with all those people yelling at me for overreacting, all I could think of was, "Any one of you could be the terrorist." 
 [Sighs] 
 The FBI can't stop what's happening. 
 And clearly, neither can I. 
 What if it can't be stopped? 
 Hey. 
 You're the leader now. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You'll find a way. 
 The whole world thought you were Public Enemy Number One, and you proved them wrong. 
 I mean, and today, we foiled an assassination. 
 Claire Haas is still alive, which is how I know that you will find this person and you will stop them. 
 Because you already are. 
 Just... do me a favor. 
 Anything. 
 No matter what happens, don't bring Ryan into this. 
 He needs to sit this one out. 
 I promise. 
 This is all you now. 
 What the hell happened tonight? 
 The Secret Service said you were standing right next to Hannah when she discharged her weapon. 
 It was pitch-black in the auditorium. 
 It was total chaos. 
 Her finger slipped on the trigger. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You honestly expect me to believe that the best agent that I've ever known accidentally fired her service weapon 40 feet from a Vice Presidential candidate? 
 Think what you want to think. 
 You want to know what I think? 
 I think you knew Hannah was looking into you. 
 I think she was close to proving exactly what it is you've been up to since you got back, and you couldn't let that happen. 
 That's insane, Ryan. 
 So... So you set her up to take the fall. 
 But here's the deal. 
 You're not in the clear because I'm coming after you now, and I will do whatever it takes to catch you. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 The OPR agents are finishing up the interview. 
 You can wait... 
 Miranda. 
 I told them everything, including you were under my supervision, Raina. 
 I was gonna lie for you. 
 I could never let you do that. 
 I made mistakes, but I'll always own up to them. 
 You two are too important to me. 
 I can't let my errors in judgment affect your future. 
 I am so very proud of you both. 
 Man : Raina Amin, we're ready. 
 Will : Can I have your attention now? 
 I have someone I need you to meet. 
 Danger, Will Olsen! You know... 
 I'd like to introduce myself. My name is John Baskin. 
 I guess it's time to stop being scared of the Sistem. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, we're the same, you and me. 
 I was on the stairs, afraid to ascend to the next level. 
 Dude, you're... you're freaking me out. 
 Why? I-I'm just acting. 
 Look. I-I used to mimic people as a kid since I'm not good at social cues. 
 I still study them today. 
 Come here. 
 See? 
 It's... It's how I get to know people. 
 And I couldn't figure you out, but... 
 All right. Anyway, so I've been studying some Sistemics videos. 
 What... What... 
 Why would you do that? What... 
 So I could help you go undercover, help you find your friend. 
 I-I-I appreciate that, but we're... we're talking about very dangerous people here. 
 I-I can't ask you to risk your life... 
 But you're not asking. I'm volunteering. 
 Okay, look. 
 When I was 9, I lost my sister in a car accident, and she could have lived, but my father wouldn't let the hospital give her a blood transfusion. 
 He was a Christian scientist. 
 Let's just say I'm not very fond of institutions that hurt the people who believe in them, and I'm not scared of them, either.

 All righty, then. 
 John. 
 Alex : You need a spot? 
 I'd say no, but... 
 Yeah, when I have ever taken no for an answer? 
 [Sighs] Exactly. 
 [Laughs] 
 All right, look. Um... you were right. 
 I was projecting. 
 I thought I'd worked through some stuff, but clearly, I have more work to do. 
 And you know what? 
 Maybe... Maybe I'll never finish, but I... 
 I shouldn't be telling you how to feel. 
 It's okay. 
 No, it's really not okay. 
 Um... 
 [Sighs] 
 You were just trying to be honest with me, and I... 
 My father used to say that there's no such thing as the truth. 
 There's what you think, what the other person thinks, and then what the world remembers. 
 That sounds complicated. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 He was. 
 And he's also the reason why it's hard for me to believe someone's being honest when they say they are. 
 You can believe me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 See? I'm not used to that. 
 But I'm working on it, okay? 
 I am... I'm... I'm working on trusting the people that I'm close to and it's... Yeah. 
 Are we close? 
 Um... 
 Um... 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'll take it. 
 I missed the Kobayashi Maru... the unwinnable situation. 
 [Laughter] 
 I always hated that one. 
 Yeah. 
 Probably because it had so much to teach me. 
 [Norah Jones' "All a Dream" plays] 
 I hate when I cannot solve a problem. 
 Caleb : The operation hit a snag, but I solved it. 
 Do you remember my roommate Will Olsen? 
 Dad, he's perfect. 
 Even when I know that there is no easy answer, I can't stop fighting. 
 Raina : I can't see you this weekend.

 I'm sorry, Simon. 
 Maybe sometime in the future.

 [Voice breaking] And that's what I did, too. 
 It is time for me to say goodbye... 
 What? 
 As your teacher. 
 [Sighs] 
 For now, at least. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Thank you. 
 I know you and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but with Miranda on leave, we are short a counselor. 
 And you're someone that the NATs already feel comfortable with. 
 Feel liking coming back? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 You don't have to hurt anyone else. 
 Hannah Wyland has been suspended. 
 She's been punished enough. 
 Please just... 
 The Voice : Oh, Alex. I'm going to miss you. 
 What do you mean you're gonna miss me? 
 We're almost done. 
 All that's left is your final mission. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 [Cellphone beeping] 
 I don't understand. The plan failed. 
 Claire Haas is still alive. 
 Why aren't they more upset, Simon? 
 What if the plan didn't fail? 
 What do you mean? 
 What if all that tonight was just a smoke screen to stop you from seeing what they were really doing? 
 [Sighs] 
 Look. 
 This is a police report from tonight. 
 Someone took advantage of the blackout and broke into Columbia's most secure lab. 
 Was something stolen? 
 They don't know. 
 They'll update the report throughout the night, but those labs were underneath that theater. 
 You know what Miranda always taught us. 
 There are no coincidences. 
 Oh, my God, Simon. Do you know what this is? 
 Our first real clue.
