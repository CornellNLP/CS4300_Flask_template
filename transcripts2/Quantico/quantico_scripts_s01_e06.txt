 My name is Alex Parrish. My life took a very drastic turn. It all started nine months ago at the FBI Academy. 
 How do I know you won't lie to me? 
 Maybe you already have. 
 Simon likes  you. 
 Miranda : My son was serving two years, and he's up for parole. 
 Shelby : You think some anonymous hackers are gonna get you out of this? 
 It's time to tell my story. 
 You got a leak in your unit. 
 Somebody tipped her off we were coming. 
 You didn't give us up. 
 I don't think she did it. 
 We're streaming to over 12 million people. 
 If you could say anything, what would it be? 
 I am innocent. 
 ♪ 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 Newscaster :  We have some new video related to the Grand Central bombing two days ago. 
 FBI sources released this video  in response to an interview yesterday, where the chief suspect, Alex Parrish... 
 They framed the brown girl. 
 ...claimed she is innocent. 
 FBI officials think the box Parrish is seen carrying likely contained the final detonator that started the chain of explosions. 
 I was delivering flak jackets. You don't need to yell at me. I'm not accusing you of anything. ...show growing public support for Parrish. But the FBI claims this video essentially proves her guilt. So you'll help me, then? Caleb was stationed in San Diego. He requested for a New York assignment days before the attack. I need you to talk to him, Shelby. Caleb hasn't spoken to me since Quantico. I highly doubt he's gonna start now. Look, as much as he and I have our issues, I can't imagine a world where Caleb Haas is a terrorist. You know what he's capable of. You know his past. And everyone's up for grabs right now. ...files found on social media,  photo-sharing apps, and security-cam feeds. ♪ [cellphone vibrates] Everything okay? They're trying to hit us back with data mined from personal accounts. Well, that was a matter of time. But they're only looking for  me in the footage. If I can see what the FBI is seeing, I might be able to find Caleb. I'll look into it when I get in. Okay, thanks. [cellphone beeps] [sighs] [groans] What was that? It was just O'Connor.

Thank you. It sounds very current and uncomplicated. [both breathing heavily] ♪ Where's the fire? I have a carefully timed route to avoid a walk of shame. If anybody should be worried, it's me. I have a reputation to live down to. I can't be seen spending all my time below the Mason-Dixon line, as much as I like the landscape. Say the word, and I'll secede. End before it gets boring, right? No, I-I have a better idea. You want to get dinner? I kind of told somebody I'd have dinner with them already. Do you want to meet me in my car when I get back? [chuckles] Yeah. ♪ What kind of man loves like this? ♪ Oh! My bad, Miss Wyatt. No, no, no. That was all me, Mr. Fletcher. Man : Looks like I just won a bet... how long it would take JFK and Jackie O. to get together. Caleb : What, Shelby and Brandon? The two richest NATs? Where have you been? They avoid each other all day, then disappear all night. Or do you think they just meet up to discuss how pretty their babies will be? ♪ What kind of man loves like this? ♪ She still isn't in, sir.

♪ Yes, I know you're fine ♪ 
♪ ♪ But I've got something that will blow your mind ♪ What?! ♪ And I'm not going down with the rest of you ♪ Liam : Miranda? You've missed some work. Charlie hid my keys from me. This is the same crap he was doing before. Hey. They were in the front door. Fine. He didn't hide them. But he is playing games with me. I should have never let the court remand him to my care. It's only been three days, and it's already clear that this is a huge mistake. One that I'm gonna have to live with for the next year if I don't lose my mind first. And the worst part of this is... I don't trust him. I don't trust him. And I don't trust myself to catch him. The boy tried to shoot up a school! Who knows what he's planning to do next? Maybe you're losing some perspective here. You know, you're stuck in this house... Do you know he's never accepted responsibility for what he tried to do? Maybe he's afraid to talk to you. Maybe he'll talk to me. He used to like me. What are you gonna do, Liam? Huh? Throw a football around with him? Call him "pal"? Go to work. Okay, maybe if he thinks you trust him, even a little bit, he'll stop hiding and open up. Vera : The art of surveillance. Watching people in their own environment. It's one of the most important tools an agent will use. These images are from computers across the country, being watched by DITU... Digital Intercept Technology Unit... housed here at Quantico. DITU watches what happens online as it happens, making it  the  most powerful surveillance tool you've never heard of. If somebody posts a manifesto against the President, a DITU agent will be the one who sends the I.P. address to Secret Service. Now, technology changes, so do surveillance methods. However, one thing will always remain the same. You don't know we're watching. Surveillance is intimate. You're looking for what someone doesn't want you to see. [light laughter] Or things someone's desperate to share but they're too afraid to be judged. So, are you ready to see what someone's really thinking? [siren wailing] All right, good news and bad news. You ready? The good news is, DITU is being run out of the command post. They're aggregating every photo, video, traffic cam, social-media post... anything from around Grand Central, before or after the attack. What's the bad news? Only personnel assigned to DITU have access to it, and you'll never believe who that is. Caleb : Booth! So, how'd you swing this, Haas? Besides being the fastest-rising FBI agent in Bureau history? By telling everyone who will listen I'm gonna make sure they reinstate the chair for your ex-girlfriend. ♪ [sighs] Alex : Caleb's running the op?! That's convenient. Yeah, well, he has friends in high places. Yeah, people who just gave him unlimited access to footage that shows what he  really was doing at Grand Central. He's gonna hide his tracks. He doesn't know I'm on to him. Ryan, I need to see what he sees. Well, that's gonna be hard, considering who's watching over him. Clayton : Caleb. You have everything you need? Don't worry, Dad. We'll catch her. There is a long-standing FBI policy prohibiting family members from working on the same op. There's also an FBI-trained terrorist on the loose. I think that trumps policy. I volunteered. Because of the other day? Because unlike you and O'Connor, I can keep my personal and professional lives separate. The Bureau needs men who are focused, not men who can't see through the fog of their mid-life crisis. Let me do my job, okay? Is there anything I can help with? ♪ [computer beeping] All right, all set. Now, once I install the PairViewer software on Caleb's computer, you will have a mirror of whatever he's looking at. Okay. If he sees it, you see it. Now, they're gonna try and build a timeline from the moment of the explosion, working backwards, so... keep your eyes open. Got it. All right. Hey, Simon? Yeah? Be careful when you sneak into Caleb's computer, okay? If... Let's just get the evidence to clear your name, okay? I'll be sneaky. Promise. It's not like we didn't both learn how, right? Miranda : As you can see, hidden cameras and microphones can be disguised almost anywhere. Inside a Hogan's Alley apartment, actors will stage scenes in which they reveal intel vital to an FBI case. Each of you will select one of these pieces of surveillance equipment, install it, and use it to find that intel. Is it better to watch? Is it better to listen? Choose your location and your equipment wisely. Good luck, and remember, someone is always watching. ♪ Fly as a mother ♪ You and Booth, huh? [scoffs] Well, it's promising, you know? Which is a nice surprise, given my history. Well, next time you and he have a nice surprise, maybe you could warn me if it's gonna be in our room? Oh, I'm sorry. Am I not as discreet as you and Caleb? So, you and Elias... is that a thing? [scoffs] That is no "thing." ♪ I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company ♪ You and Alex? We're friends. ♪ Looking high and low ♪ It did sound very friendly this morning. Alex : True love? Just lust. In the past, all the guys I dated I thought of as marriage material, and I always ended up getting hurt. Not with Caleb. It's not complex because  he  is not complex. There's no feelings, no talks. Just us and an empty room. Or sometimes not an empty room. [both laugh] Hey. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just trying to figure out when or even  if  I should tell Alex some stuff. You ever worry about that? How someone might react to something in your past? Raina : I don't understand. Why would anyone go into an empty room and make love to someone they have no connection to? Mm, who said anything about love? All Caleb is is an athletic and energetic stand-in until the right one comes along. Even more depressing. What? Haven't you ever wanted the company of someone for... fun? I made my choice, and I'm proud of it. When I meet the right man, he'll be glad I did, too. My advice... you got something to tell Alex, don't wait. Get in front of it. Do it face-to-face. ♪ Hide away, hide away ♪ 
♪ Looking high and low ♪ If you do... ♪ Someone let me know ♪ Let me know if it works. ♪ Where do the good boys go to hide away? ♪ Man, what are you doing? This is my room, not the kitchen. What? I thought we could spend some time together, you know? Catch up. I used to come by all the time. Yeah, until my dad found out about you and my mom. And then I never saw you again. I guess you really cared about her, huh? You put up a good fight. You have no idea what happened between the three of us. Well, you're here, he's dead. Does that mean you won? [sighs] Do you miss him? I don't miss anyone. 'Cause I never had anyone. My dad never liked me, and my mom never trusted me. Ignored then, suffocated now. And somewhere in the middle... the school. Are you kidding me right now? You wanted people to pay attention to you. That's what I'm doing. I don't want anything from you. If you want to talk to somebody, you go and you talk to my mom, and you ask her why she was so desperate to get rid of me that she made the whole thing up! You know, you're not a little kid anymore, Charlie. You're a grown man. And grown men don't hide behind lies. And grown women do? [sighs] [sniffles] [chuckles] You're on her side. So you wouldn't understand. So why don't you just pack up and eat your bit someplace else? ♪ You mind if I borrow this? Get out of my room. ♪ Vera : Meet our surveillance suspects... Edward and Donna. Married three years, they're behind on their rent and they have a failing corner store. And yet the bank tipped us off last week that several hundred thousand dollars in cash was deposited into their account. So we suspect Edward of being involved with organized crime. Now, will the piece of equipment you installed in Hogan's Alley enable us to hear or see what Edward is involved in? Go on. Impress me. I noticed you put your bug under the sink. That was smart. I tried to think of where in my home I have real conversations. Never had real conversations in my home. You must miss Elias, then. It's a shame you don't spend your day off together. I don't want to spend my day off with him. I meant I'm glad you found someone who makes you happy. I have. Do you think after you wake up tomorrow, maybe we could go... Yeah. Just a second. That empty apartment would be the perfect place for us to sneak away to. Hmm. You mean after your date? I'll see you there. Yeah, well, what about all these cameras? ♪ How long have you guys been together? We're not. I'm more like her butler. Which was fun the first time we role-played that, but now I'm, like, stuck in it. And you're complaining? Well, she's got a date tonight with somebody that she actually likes, and I'm stuck here, sitting on my hands, waiting to see whether or not she's gonna take me out of the bedstand when she gets back. [chuckling] That doesn't happen to Haas men. Yeah, I can see why. It makes them unattractive. Find out who she's going on a date with tonight and take them out. ♪ Unattractive? I'll give her a B-plus for effort. C-minus for hand placement. [sighs] When can you and I get some real time together? Maybe grab that cheeseburger at that diner down the road? Is this you asking me out on a date? You are familiar with the concept? Well, I was kind of hoping... to ask you out first. Well, what the hell were you waiting for? For you to finish your task. ♪ Simon Asher just asked me out. [laughs] From the way he talks to us, I never really believed he was gay. Miranda said not to get close to anyone, especially Simon. If she had her way, we'd be quarantined until she needed us. Nimah, I'm not like you. I believe in following rules. If he asks again, just make sure he knows I am not interested. You're good at that. I put that book in his room so I'll know he's okay. [chuckles] If you wanted to know if he's okay, then you  talk to him. You think I haven't spent every visit over the last two years asking him, "What did I miss, and how did I miss it?" I'm done asking questions. If he's planning something, he's not gonna tell me. I learned that the hard way. He's not a minor anymore, Miranda. So your surveillance operation is potentially illegal. If his parole officer found out, Charlie would be in a halfway house, out of your sight. So if you really want to lose track of him, keep doing what you're doing. Vera : Congratulations. Each of you have earned a spot on the live-surveillance exercise. Vasquez, you run point. Haas, you'll act as a DITU analyst. Caleb : Let me guess... we'll be surveilling each other, secrets will be revealed, and lessons will be learned? Usually, that is how this goes down. But I think you're up for a challenge, Mr. Haas. This time, you will be surveilling... me. We're looking into you? But we know you. You  think  you know me. You only know who I am inside this building. There are things you do not know. And in order to figure that out, you have to follow me and everyone I talk to outside of these walls. Those of you who do well will know who I am and what I'm planning. Otherwise, you'll be tapped out. I'll be on the move in 20 minutes, but you can start panicking now. [horns honking] ♪ Simon : Come on. ♪ I'm in. You're 15 minutes into the exercise. You have eyes on Miranda. So, what do you know? We have two teams on Miranda herself, including Booth and Parrish at her house. And on campus, Miranda just talked to a marine in dress uniform. We need to discover what his connection is to the Assistant Director. Maybe he knows what she's planning. Hey, Brandon, intercept and interview. On it. I will catch you later. ♪ What do you have for me? We need someone by the main gate as Miranda exits. On it. Oh, and don't worry... I'll make sure the only person tapping Brandon out tonight is you. So, you figured it out. Oh, you are a better analyst than I thought. And you're more predictable than I thought. I look forward to your romantic wedding announcement in the  Financial Times. ♪ That's Liam's car, and Miranda isn't here. Yet. Maybe Liam spending the night  is  Miranda's plan. Hey, I-I'm sorry about before if I... I made it awkward. [chuckles] Like I'm doing now. How about we get eliminated from this futile exercise on purpose so we can have a real conversation without everyone around? Wait, you'd... you'd fail just so we could talk? Nimah : I'll meet you in my room. ♪ Trainee Vasquez, you don't know Miranda's plan. What are you gonna do with the agents you have left? How about we follow her assistant? Intel says that she has Miranda's computer on her, and she's on the move. So get someone on it. Way ahead of you. Fletcher? What you got? Asset moving toward you, heading to her car. I don't have a car to follow her with. I got you. Behind you, there's a black GLK350. Keys are in the center console. Ignore the condoms. Well, Liam's not alone. Thermal scan shows two warm bodies, which means our potential for scandal has just increased. Alex : Ooh. In the meantime... bam. Now it's a proper stakeout. Did you at least get us coffee? Oh, my God. You stole this from Simon, didn't you? No. Yes. Yes. I did. [laughs] What? Liam :  Hello? Miranda :  Hey. So you were right. You win. If Charlie's gonna do something, me watching him isn't gonna stop him. I'm glad you came around. You don't have to stay. Let him have some freedom, right? Oh, and, Liam? Thank you. Wait. Charlie... who's he? Caleb says Miranda's son. Just out from juvie on possession of unregistered firearms. Liam : That was your mother. I, uh, think I'm gonna take off. Charlie :  Watch me cry bitter tears. [static] Oh! We're getting interference. Yeah, you think? Let me see if I can get our mikes clear. Okay. Vasquez : Intel came back that Miranda's computer wasn't with her assistant. Uh-huh. Why is Fletcher following her? Because game, set, match... me. You told me to take out the competition. I heard the assistant was heading for a three-day weekend in Maine. So that means no date with Shelby tonight or tomorrow or the night after that. Brandon's gone. You're a moron. I'm the one dating Brandon. She lied to me? 
 
 ♪ Charlie :  You said you were leaving. Leave. Liam :  One more thing before I do. It's gone... the interference. Maybe it passed. I'll wait here. I can't really move right now. That is Felix. He went to Georgetown... full scholarship. That is June. She took a year off to study performance art. Really pissed her parents off. And that's Louisa. She retook the S.A.T. three times 'cause she thought she could do better. [chuckles] And once made her father stop traffic to help turtles cross the road. And she's my daughter. We don't talk very much. And why do I care about your terrible parenting? Each one of these kids is alive because your mother stopped you from killing them. Instead of visiting graves,  their parents get to visit dorm rooms. And every time Louisa ignores my call, at least I know she's alive. And there's still hope she'll forgive me one day. Do you get that you almost took that hope away? ♪ Alex : He's been rewinding for hours. He's not stopped. He's looking for something specific. He is... you. No. He's going too fast for that. He'd miss me. I think he's looking for himself. Wait. What was that? Hmm. He just deleted something. Maybe it wasn't important. Simon, I need control over Caleb's computer right now. Simon : Of course. Want me to get you a unicorn while I'm at it? Look, as long as he is at his desk, the second you take control, he will notice, report it, and find you. Well, pull the fire alarm, steal his car. I don't care. Can you please get him away from his desk so I can see what he trashed? Simon : All right, I might be able to get you 60 seconds to drag the file from his trash to your computer, but that is it. That's fine. If the file's large, you're not gonna have time. I'll get Caleb off his desk. Call Ryan so he can tell you when the 60 seconds is up. Got it. [cellphone vibrates] O'Connor for you, again. ♪ Liam : Booth? What the hell are you doing here? Can't talk right now, sir. Sir? [chuckles] That's... that's rich. Are you so far off the reservation that you're spying on  me  now? I had no idea that you would be here. So, what... you're spying on the Assistant Director? Are you trying to get yourself arrested? No. That's not why I'm here. Wow, you really can't let it go, can you? Booth, I told you, your job watching Alex Parrish is over. You really need to stop talking right now. As far as I'm concerned, your standing as an agent in the Bureau is finished. The Assistant Director actually had us surveilling her for an assignment. Congratulations. You just blew your own op with Alex. ♪ [engine turns over] Alex, wait! Alex! Alex! ♪ Do you like the tea? I... [chuckles] Yeah, I do. Does Elias like tea? I'm... I'm sorry, I-I shouldn't have brought it up. It's okay. Um... at a certain... point in my life, it became easier for me to... ...to let people believe I was gay rather than show them who I really was. So they wouldn't see the real me, who I am. And the longer that that went on, the... more comfortable it got. It gave me boundaries. Just like you have boundaries. I have boundaries until I know I can trust someone. Do you trust me?

So, you just wanted to make sure that  I  knew that I wasn't good enough for you... that I could take the car out for a spin, but I could never afford it. That is not how I think of you. I know exactly how you think of me. Caleb, I like you. Okay? A lot more than I should. Every time that we're together, I don't want to leave when it's over. But I came here to do one thing, and that's become an FBI agent. But when I'm around you, it's like... it's like I forget that, and I just become a girl. And I cannot let that happen. This is too important to me. Listen... I really need this to be what it is. You know, the fun thing we do when we have the time, not the thing that takes time away from what it is that we're doing.

But, I don't know, drinks turned to dinners, which turned to walking around the city late at night, which turned to... We didn't want this to happen. We pushed it off as long as we could, but then last week, we thought, you know what? Why don't we just... why don't we just spend a few days together, you know, and see if there's really something there. So I told everyone I was taking a vacation to Buenos Aires. I even bought tickets. We checked in to the Andaz by the library, and... Well, you know the rest. We didn't think that we would run into anybody. We had no idea that Caleb was even in town.
