 Previously on "Quantico"... 
 This is you, but it's not you. 
 It's Mark Raymond. 
 Shelby : I wanted to apologize. I've been unfair to you. 
 If you ever want to sit and talk. 
 Now's not a good time. 
 Samar : You'll do what you promised? 
 Yeah, I'll do it. 
 A student? You slept with her. I'll expect your resignation in the morning. 
 You could be wrong about Charlie? 
 I know who he is. 
 Someday, everyone else will, too. 
 It's your job to stay out of my way, down in Operations. 
 The Voice : You weren't the terrorist before, but now you're going to be. 
 The Voice : Listen carefully. Tomorrow morning, you will receive a package at the FBI field office. Do not open it until I give you further instructions. 
 [Groans] 
 We've been trying to decode this terrorist's voice all night, and we still have nothing. 
 Okay, the algorithm they're employing... it's complex. 
 It's gonna take time to unmask them. 
 But we don't have time, Simon. 
 Whoever they are, they have all the security details of the candidates for next week's elections. 
 This package is the next part of their plan. 
 We will get ahead of them. 
 I promise. 
 Natalie died because I failed to do exactly that. 
 What makes you think I can now? 
 Because I'm here. 
 I can't make the same mistake twice, can I? 
 It's gallows humor. 
 Okay, so how do we derail their plan without them knowing? 
 Getting the candidates' security details changed is a start, but you don't have clearance for that. 
 Ryan does. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 And I'll try to figure out who the voice behind our terrorist is. 
 First one of us that doesn't end up in jail or dead wins. 
 No more gallows humor, please. 
 I wasn't joking.

 Miranda : I'd like us all to welcome Senator Claire Haas. 
 [Applause] 
 I asked Ms. Haas to be our enrichment speaker this morning because... we are going to discuss one of her cases. 
 February 3, 2008. 
 Does anyone remember what happened on that day? 
 How about you, Perales? 
 Super Bowl 42. 
 Giants won 17-14. 
 Spoiled the Pats' perfect season. 
 And an hour after the game ended, five Giants fans got into a fight with four Patriots fans in the parking lot of a New Haven club. 
 One of the Patriots fans was killed. 
 Is this a hate crime? 
 What if I told you that the Patriots' fans were black, the Giants' fans white? 
 Anyone reconsidering? 
 And if I told you that the white male who was charged with stabbing and killing the black male had once belonged to a militia group? 
 So, what if I told you at the time of the stabbing, Mr. Connors had reformed? 
 What if I told you that he had married a black woman and had three beautiful children with her? 
 Confusing, isn't it? 
 It's the FBI's job to investigate and prosecute violent hate crimes. 
 But determining which violent offenses were motivated by bias is one of the toughest jobs the FBI has to do. 
 So, you are going to look at cases that were presented to the FBI for investigation. 
 And using the evidence on-hand, you will decide if this is a hate crime or merely violent offenses, all right? 
 You could have told me that you were coming to speak at enrichment. 
 Well, actually, I'm here to spy on you. 
 And as part of an oversight committee regarding funding, I'm touring Quantico. 
 Lunch together when my tour is done? 
 Ms. Wyatt could join. 
 Or not. You can tell me then. 
 You look like you're trying to do long division in your head. 
 Well, I guess I was just a little naive to think that Caleb and I still had a chance. 
 But he's not talking to me. 
 Settle something. 
 Caleb... into Shelby or not? 
 Her ever-changing emotional state directly affects my ability to get a good night's sleep. 
 So, what's the deal with Caleb? 
 I, uh, I wish I could tell you, but, uh... 
 He's not just Caleb. 
 What are you talking about? 
 He has an alter ego named Mark Raymond who wears different clothes, uses a different computer, and last night, one of them started sleeping with an envelope that he got from a woman at a diner. 
 Two sides to Caleb... 
 How intriguing. 
 Oh, no. 
 Last four times you called someone intriguing, you ended up having intercourse with them. 
 Please don't. Caleb's my roommate. 
 I just want to know what's inside that envelope. 
 Let's start there. 
 Liam : Hey. Um... 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Miranda found out what happened between us. 
 Hey, sorry to interrupt your little moment here, but back in the pros, if they cut you, they did it fast. 
 Yeah, well, this ain't the pros. 
 And don't get comfortable. I meant what I said. 
 I'm on my way to Miranda's office now. 
 Look, he has a lot on his mind. 
 He's just... If you're defending him, you're just as much a part of the problem as he is, okay? 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Miranda : Hi, Nimah. 
 I don't have time to talk right now. 
 I'm expecting someone. 
 Do you have Raina, a trainee, working an undercover assignment outside of Quantico? 
 Did you willingly send her to a potential terrorist cell knowing she hasn't finished her training, knowing the kind of person that she is? 
 Ms. Amin. 
 You're not here to question my judgment. 
 Someone has to. 
 [Sighs] Raina, where are you? 
 Miranda, I'm at the cell house. 
 Everyone is gone, and they took the guns. 
 Raina, get out of there. 
 I need to call this in. 
 The Voice : Listen carefully. 
 Tomorrow morning, you will receive a package at the FBI field office. 
 Do not open it until I give you further instructions. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Aren't you five floors above your pay grade, Parrish, or did you just come up to use our FedEx account? 
 I was actually looking for Ryan. 
 Well, if it's FBI business, you can talk to me. 
 If it's personal, you can do that on your own time, or you know, not at all, 'cause we have a pretty busy day up here. 
 The JTTF is giving the candidates their counterterrorism briefing for the campaign's final days, and you twisting the knife further into my ex-husband... it's not on the itinerary. 
 [Cellphone buzzes] 
 Oh, my God. I thought I told...

 In the Senator's purse is an identical bottle. 
 You'll need to swap it out with the one you're holding. 
 What is it? Poison? 
 If I wanted to kill the senator, she'd be dead already.

 You've met on numerous occasions. 
 You were both there that day at Quantico.

 Raina, I need you to go to my house, bring Charlie here where he's safe. 
 So, you wanted my official resignation. 
 Raina Amin infiltrated the cell that took Charlie. 
 Excuse me? She did it on her own. 
 I only found out about it later. 
 Oh, and you let her continue? 
 I don't answer to you, Liam. 
 Don't you get self-righteous with me. 
 Crossing the line with a trainee is not the same as putting one in danger.

 We're not good for each other. 
 Look at you. 
 You're here right now instead of being undercover. 
 I cloud your judgment. 
 And you keep me off my game, too. 
 People were shooting at me with real guns today, and... and all I could think about was you. 
 I want to do this job, and I want to do it well, and I... 
 I can't do that with you in my head. 
 So, what? It's... it's the FBI over me? 
 It's me over us. 
 Well, why can't you have both? 
 I'm brand-new, Ryan. 
 And I can't lose everything that I've ever wanted because of... because of some guy, no matter who that guy is. 
 Even if it's you. 
 [Sighs] 
 We still have eight minutes. 
 [Sighs] 
 Thanks for the beer. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 You were working for my parents, lying to me for 13 years. 
 13 years. 
 I was poor. 
 I needed the money. 
 I didn't know who you were. 
 I didn't know who they were. 
 I just did what they asked. 
 Took money from you to give to them for a small cut. 
 And the more I got to know you, the worse I felt. 
 So you conned me out of another $5 million? 
 That was my husband. 
 Hmm. 
 I begged him not to do it. 
 She did ask me to give the money back to you. 
 After everything I've done to you, I know you can't forgive me, but I want you to know, it doesn't matter if we don't share blood. 
 You are my sister. 
 You and I... 
 We're nothing. 
 You are as dead to me as my parents were. 
 You're as dead to me as they still are. 
 I just wanted to look you in the eye and tell you that myself. 
 [Siren wails, Police radio chatter] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Liam : Two right there and one over there. 
 Right now! Go! 
 Stay off that line. 
 Not you. Go around that way. 
 Go, go, go. Keep a safe distance from the house. 
 Everyone away from the windows. 
 Talk to me. It doesn't have to end... 
 Everyone off the couch! 
 Give me the phone. What did you do, Raina? 
 Let's go. Let's go. Move. 
 Ahh, the line went dead. Take that. 
 Talk to me. Talk to me. 
 It doesn't have to go down like this. 
 What's his name? What's his name? 
 Derrick. 
 Rishan. 
 My Muslim name is Rishan. 
 You are not a Muslim. You're a thug. 
 You have perverted the true faith. 
 What do you know about my faith? 
 Everything! 
 Everything that you pretend to know. 
 I know that if you kill me, you will miss your shahada. 
 And I know the Qur'an does not teach you to hate. 
 Hate is what this country feels for true believers like me. 
 I pray you find peace. 
 Rishan, no! 
 You're right. 
 Killing Raina out of vengeance? 
 The Front taught me to be smarter than that. 
 We wanted to strike a blow to the FBI and we failed today. 
 Killing you will have to be enough. 
 Take it. 
 I said take it! 
 Prove you're a true believer... or die with her, man. 
 Prove it. 
 It's okay, son. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's all right. 
 Charlie : [Inhales sharply] 
 [Breathes shallowly] 
 [Groans] 
 It's over, Charlie. 
 Baby, it's over. Give me the gun. 
 No. 
 Come on, give me the gun. 
 I know. It's okay. 
 I'm... 
 I know. 
 I didn't know everything. 
 It don't even matter now. 
 [Crying] 
 Mom, I didn't know everything. 
 It doesn't even matter now. 
 Come on, now. 
 Charlie, please. 
 Give me the gun. 
 Please listen to your mother. 
 I can't. 
 No. Charlie, you got to give me the gun. 
 The cops outside... they're gonna arrest me. 
 Liam : Give me a sit report. 
 Agents' Voices : Suspect is armed... black male, age 19, short hair. 
 Snipers in position. 
 Green light when you have it. 
 Miranda : Son, please. 
 [Groans] 
 And it's gonna be prison this time. 
 It's gonna be life because I got priors. 
 Listen to me, Charlie. 
 They will shoot you on sight after shots fired in a hostage situation. 
 Son, come on, please trust me. 
 Charlie : No! 
 Come on, trust me, son! 
 No! No, I don't trust you! 
 I can't go back! 
 Agents' Voices : Armed target approaching east window. 
 I just need a second to think. 
 Charlie, get down. 
 [Groans] 
 Charlie, get down! 
 Agents' Voices : Target locked. 
 Charlie, get down! 
 [Groans] 
 Mom. 
 [Screaming frantically] 
 No! No! 
 Go, go! We're going in! Go, go!

 [Crying] I just didn't want him to get killed. 
 [Alarm beeps] 
 Time's up. 
 We got to warn everyone. 
 They're all in danger now. 
 Oh, my God. How? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 If you have to hurt someone, it should be me. 
 Not my friends. Me, you understand that? 
 The Voice : Why would I do that? 
 You did exactly what I asked. 
 You're proving more useful than I imagined. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 But, I... 
 [Knock on door] 
 Open up. It's Hannah Wyland. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Look, Hannah, I can explain. 
 Okay, so after you left, I tried Natalie's cell. 
 No response. 
 I tried her ex-husband, called her family, No one's heard from her in days. 
 It's as if she just disappeared. 
 That's what I was... 
 Okay, so I traced the e-mail that she sent asking for "emergency personal leave." 
 It didn't come from her computer or her phone. 
 It was bounced from a remote server... untraceable. 
 There's no reason why Natalie would do something like that, which means she didn't do it, which means I had to consider t he horrible possibility that you, unstable, out-of-control, paranoid Alex Parrish, America's least wanted... weren't lying, incorrect, or insane. 
 You were simply telling the truth. 
 I just... 
 So I swapped the pills, and now before I'm arrested and tried for treason alongside the two of you, will someone please tell me, did I just poison the next Vice President of the United States? 
 Oh, my God, Hannah. Just shut up. 
 Because if I did... 
 Just shut up and stop talking! 
 Are you ready? 
 Um... 
 Yeah, go ahead. It's your turn.
