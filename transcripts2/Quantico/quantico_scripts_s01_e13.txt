 My name is Alex Parrish. I'm an FBI agent. In July, a terrorist blew up Grand Central Terminal in New York. But before that, I was still a trainee. These people were my friends... or at least I thought they were. One of them is a terrorist. And now I'm racing to find out who they are before they strike again. 
 Miranda : Meet the class above you. 
 Liam : These are the people that are gonna spend the day kicking your ass. 
 You're Alex? 
 Relax, Tebow. 
 [Whistle blows] 
 I'm gonna smack you around. 
 You're just gonna try not to bruise. 
 I don't feel like going back in there right now. 
 Take me somewhere? 
 I'm your teacher. 
 The woman you thought was your sister has been kidnapped. 
 Please help me. 
 I know there is someone else, Ryan. 
 When's this gonna end? 
 The Voice : The first time I saw you at the Academy, I knew what you were capable of. 
 You weren't the terrorist before, but now you're going to be. 
 If you want to remain safe, you're going to do exactly what I say... both of you. 
 Which is what? 
 Return to work in the morning and then wait for further instruction. 
 But I... 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Oh, my God. I'm so... I'm so sorry. 
 How did this even get on you? 
 Vasquez : I have no idea. 
 I must have been drugged, like you were. 
 The last thing I remember is leaving the hearing to walk to the subway. 
 And when I woke up, it was on me. 
 Alex, l-listen to me. 
 Listen to me. 
 You were right this whole time. 
 Elias was just a puppet, and now we are, too. 
 You said you were looking into everyone in our class, right? 
 [Sniffles] 
 What did you find? 
 Okay. [Breathing heavily] 
 Elias called in a tip on the orders of the terrorist to frame me. 
 The idea of our class was just a red herring. 
 So, what are you saying? 
 It could be anyone you've ever met? 
 No, not anyone. 
 Because that person on the phone just told me that they saw me the first day at the Academy. 
 They had my fingerprints from orientation. 
 We need to start all over again. 
 We need to... We need to look at everyone who was there from the first day at Quantico... field counselors, the other classes, Liam, Miranda, just... 
 Ryan. 
 Ryan? 
 This is all my fault. I missed the bigger picture. 
 How could you think straight? You were running for your life. 
 For someone with a bomb strapped to their chest, you're thinking straight. 
 I was always better than you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We're gonna find whoever's doing this, okay? 
 And we're gonna stop them. 
 And you are going to survive. 
 Liam : So, you survived the integration. 
 Now, instead of toe-to-toe, you are one unit, one class. 
 Time to leave the animosity behind.

 Okay. 
 Khaled says whoever took his wife finally made contact. 
 They're demanding $5 million cash for her safe return. 
 I mean, do you even have that kind of cash? 
 Actually, don't answer that. 
 On one hand, how could I possibly pay the ransom for someone who conned me for over a decade? 
 But then [sighs] I don't know. 
 On the other hand, she's... she's the only semblance of family I have left. 
 Look, if you want to find out who's behind it, you got to follow the money. 
 The question is, is it worth $5 million to find the answer? 
 How could we even follow the money? 
 It's in Croatia. 
 W-With my father's help, if you're willing to let me get him involved. 
 Well, at least you asked this time. 
 Do it. 
 My suspicions were correct... 
 Mom said you never went home for New Year's. 
 I was visiting a friend. 
 And you lied to me, to her? 
 He who makes peace between people by inventing good information is not a liar. 
 Don't quote your Hadiths to me. 
 What friend? I know all your friends. 
 You used to tell me everything. 
 You always thought so. 
 Miranda : I've told you before about the dangers of secrets. 
 Now it is time you learn their value. 
 In the field, secrets can very quickly become currency. 
 This week, we are going to talk human intelligence. 
 Who knows what that means? 
 Intelligence gathered by means of interpersonal contact, as opposed to more technical intelligence-gathering disciplines, such as signals, imagery, messaging, and signature intelligence. 
 [Light laughter] It was a rhetorical question, Dr. Olsen. 
 Which he answered correctly, by the way. 
 But... who are these people you're using these methods on, and what kind of intelligence are you gathering from them? 
 It's time you learn how to source informants. 
 When approaching a source, it is imperative that you know everything about them that makes them tick... their interests, their fears, their pressure points, and, of course... their weaknesses. 
 When you know how to exploit a weakness, you can get a person to do almost anything you want. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 They're just as scared of you. 
 [Sighs] I don't have my badge yet. 
 My reinstatement interview is in an hour. 
 I'd say show them your I.D., but I'm pretty sure everyone knows who you are. 
 She's with me. 
 [Beeps] 
 Thank you. 
 I'm surprised you're still talking to me. 
 Yeah, what you believe in on your own is your business now, as long as you show up here and do your job. 
 I'm going to the morning briefing. 
 I'll head upstairs with you. 
 Oh, they didn't tell you? 
 Tell me what? 
 You don't work upstairs anymore. 
 On whose orders? 
 Hannah : Mine. 
 [Sighs] I'm sorry. 
 Hannah, I didn't know that... 
 That I'm the Special Agent in Charge of the Joint Terrorism Task Force? 
 Well, since everyone above me was murdered when the bank blew up, I was next in line. 
 So now it's my job to get the JTTF back up and running. 
 And it's your job to stay far, far out of my way, down in Operations. 
 Did I do something to piss you off? 
 You mean besides turning the deaths of 32 of the finest agents the Bureau's ever seen into your own last stand? 
 You may have come to your senses and said what the commission needed you to say, but until I'm sure you meant it, you're gonna work your way back up to good standing. 
 If this is about Ryan, you should know that... 
 [Chuckles] Oh, that's the thing about you. 
 You make everything so personal. 
 See, when I walk through those doors, I leave my personal life outside. 
 Now, if we were to run into each other on the street, at a café, on the subway, two feet outside the front doors, sure... maybe then I'd tell you how much I don't like you or respect you or particularly enjoy the fact that you used my ex-husband and his considerable feelings for you as a bulletproof vest not once, but twice in your fugitive escapade. 
 But in here? 
 In here, we talk only about the work, and we do so without question because that's our job. 
 So what you're gonna do is you're gonna keep your head down and your nose clean and perform mostly clerical duties for agents upstairs, and you're gonna do so with no questions. 
 Do you have any questions? 
 No, you don't, because there are no questions. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Okay, that's not the ringtone of a Bureau-issued phone. 
 Yeah, well, they took my Bureau phone when they suspended me. 
 That's my cell. 
 I'll get you a new one. Don't answer that down here. 
 Yep. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Ringing continues] 
 Hello? 
 The Voice : I want the contents of JTTF server room 33. 
 You and Natalie have two hours to get them. 
 I-I don't even have clearance to the JTTF server room. 
 I-I don't know how... 
 I have faith in your resourcefulness. 
 I'm sure you'll figure something out... both of you... because, if you don't, Natalie dies. 
 But... 
 All right. Let's do exactly as we talked about, and you'll be fine, okay? 
 Hey. So, I just got this, and they asked me to check if it was working. 
 [Beeps] 
 Special Agent Parrish. You're good. 
 Can I check my clearance? 
 Sure. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 It's good to be back. Thank you. 
 Okay, to access the server room, we need two things... an access key card and a master thumbprint to delete the internal records of whatever it is that we have to download. 
 There's only one JTTF agent in New York who has high enough clearance to have a master thumbprint. 
 Who? 
 The Agent in Charge. 
 Hannah Wyland. 
 Okay, I'll get the thumbprint. 
 You work on the key cards. How many are there? 
 I.T. would have one. 
 You'd never get it off them. 
 And the ASAC next in line to her. 
 Ryan Booth. 
 You guys aren't talking much these days, are you? 
 You mean since we broke up because he was still in love with you? 
 No, we aren't. 
 I know he feels bad about it, but... 
 Can you use it? 
 Weaknesses... everyone has them, but everyone can be exploited in different ways. 
 You can use their family. 
 You can exploit their honesty, their sexuality. 
 Whatever you use will hit close to home. 
 Earlier, you noticed each other's physical weaknesses.

 Now you're going to team up and assess their emotional ones. 
 Can you turn someone, even if they're one your own? 
 ♪ You keep calling, you keep calling ♪ 
 The first step is identifying personality types... 
 ♪ Saying that you want it back ♪ 
 .. using the Myers-Briggs test. 
 ♪ All my loving, all my loving ♪ 
 Seems like a definite extrovert to me. 
 You know, more of a feeler than a thinker. 
 Mm. Seems more like a provider to me. 
 [Chuckles] Natalie would know, huh? 
 ♪ You ripped it out and you chewed it ♪ 
♪ And the more you talk, you prove it ♪ 
 Um, provider it is. 
 ♪ Yeah, you prove it ♪ 
 Know the 16 types. 
 Are they a guardian, a healer, or a performer? 
 A born performer. 
 Oh, wrong. 
 We've known him longer than you. 
 He's a clown... trust me. 
 Like Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Madonna, Caleb Jacob Haas is a dynamo... similar qualities to a performer, but a dynamo encapsulates a need to keep things at a fast pace rather than let them turn real or emotional. 
 Uh, but given that you're a commander, Nimah...

 Miranda : Knowing your target is half the battle in turning a source.

 He is serious, a rule-follower. 
 ♪ Are you joking? Are you joking? ♪ 
 A complete introvert. 
 ♪ I can't, I can't ♪ 
 Looks like an inspector to me. 
 I'm an extrovert, in case you were wondering, in every way. 
 ♪ Yeah, you ripped it out and you chewed it ♪ 
 Miranda : Step two... once you have identified the personality, what is the best approach to turning your fellow NAT? 
 We need to figure out his weak points, which, at this moment, may be the double Dutch? 
 Since providers are sensitive to the needs of others, the best way to turn them is to be direct. 
 Ohh. Directness is so something a "visionary" would suggest. 
 Coercion's the way to go. 
 Providers value their family and friends. 
 Threaten that, and he'll turn. 
 Why am I not surprised a champion such as yourself would want to take advantage of someone's openness? 
 I think this is all a bunch of B.S. 
 Put a gun to his head, or mine, and we'll find out already. 
 Flattery is the way to go with Caleb. 
 Make him feel pretty and important. 
 Let him call you any celebrity names that he wants. 
 Or not? 
 Studies on FBI sourcing techniques show that money is effective 45% of the time, coercion... 75%, and a sense of civic duty... 83%. 
 But if you feel that hollow platitudes are the best method, who am I to quibble? 
 Miranda : In the field, you only get one shot, so choose the best one or you fail. 
 Iris : Quid pro quo is rational enough for an inspector to bite. 
 I say we send that to the EAD. 
 Shelby : I'm not sure that bribery is the best way to break a rule-follower. 
 I would convince him that he's doing the right thing. 
 Who said anything about bribing? 
 I offer him something... he offers back. 
 What do you have to offer him? 
 Do you really want me to answer that question? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Caleb, you choose. 
 Which one of us should approach him?

 And here I thought the Croatia Project was just a cutesy name for a future pub crawl. 
 A tip... it's all about Mexico City these days. 
 Croatia... is none of your business. 
 Guess all those government tech contacts I made during my trip for my first startup won't come in handy, then. 
 Caleb : Shelby, come here. 
 Brandon : I'm a very good listener, in case you didn't already know. 
 If you need to try out a sourcing technique on someone you're sleeping with, you're doing something very wrong. 
 Sorry. You don't have to tell me. 
 I just... 
 My ex is suing me for sole custody of Renata. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Come here. 
 What are we doing down here? 
 This is what your dad suggested? 
 Having her interrogate me again? 
 No. As soon as you transferred that $5 million this morning, they were able to trace it. 
 The woman you know as Samar Hashmi, Haifaa Said, hasn't been kidnapped. 
 She is alive and well and hiding out in Zagreb. 
 And with Samar being discovered, their con needed a new face. 
 And at $5 million, they could buy as many as they want. 
 You've been conned long enough, Ms. Wyatt. 
 If anyone asks for more money, do not pay. 
 Forget these people ever existed and let us take it from here. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm not. 
 They don't get to take my money. 
 We're gonna get it back. 
 Miranda : You all did well. 
 You did very well. 
 You accurately identified your peers' personality types and proposed strong approaches to turn them. 
 But there's no substitute for real-life experience. 
 The true test of your ability to cultivate human intelligence will happen in the field tonight. 
 You will go to a location where the FBI has hopes of cultivating real sources which means you will approach a source with the goal of having them call the number on these cards and agree to cooperate. 
 You only get one card because you only get one chance. 
 [Whispering] I have to go. 
 Where is Raina going? 
 You know that the two of you can't be seen in public at the same time... you know that. 
 But I got the last exercise. 
 She wanted to sit this one out. 
 Your assignment will be The 10th Justice, a local D.C. hangout popular with... corrupt congressmen, politicos, and ambitious aides. 
 You will have one hour to recruit an informant. 
 Do not disappoint. 
 Ryan. 
 Hey. I thought you called in sick. 
 I'm feeling better. 
 But you should keep a little distance. 
 Is it weird for you to be working together? 
 Oh, me and Hannah? 
 Me and you? 
 Me and Alex? 
 You just wanted me to say that so I could hear how crazy it sounds, didn't you? 
 Well, I know it's crazy, which is why I put in for a transfer. 
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that... because I'm trying. 
 I like Hannah, and I'm being nice to Alex. 
 In fact, I thought I'd take her to lunch. 
 That's nice of you. 
 But you're going to pay for it. 
 Seems only fair after everything you've put me through.

 [Knock on door]

 Look, I know you blame me for hurting Ryan, but [sighs] I had no one else to turn to when I was framed. 
 He's the only one who's ever believed in me. 
 Right, because he has integrity, decency, and honor. 
 Are you still in love with him? 
 [Chuckles] Okay. 
 Is that why you came in here, just to press my buttons? 
 No, actually, just to press this one. 
 Tech support left it at my desk when I was gone, and I couldn't figure out how to mobile-access the Bureau's network database. 
 Hand it over. 
 Okay. Are you serious? 
 What? 
 I told you... You're in Operations. 
 Your new clearance level doesn't allow for off-network access.

 What do you believe would cause a person like her to keep secrets from her family?

 I might need some help at Customs. 
 Deal. 
 How do I get in touch with you? 
 Here's my card... with my name. 
 Trainee Parrish, you have just failed this exercise. 
 What? You're an agent? 
 The test wasn't, Can you turn me? 
 It was, Can I turn you? 
 [Scoffs] 
 I failed, too. 
 What? 
 Which is even worse than your fellow NATs that came up empty. 
 Whenever you are approaching someone, they are approaching you, reading you, searching you for a weakness to exploit. 
 They can use money, s*x, ego, the dignity of a cause... whatever it takes, to turn you on their side, because the information that you have in your head is always more valuable than what is in theirs. 
 Never forget... a bad approach costs us nothing. 
 A bad agent costs us everything.
