 My name is Alex Parrish. I'm an FBI agent. In July, a terrorist blew up Grand Central terminal in New York. Nine months before that, I was still a trainee. These people were my friends... at least, I thought they were. One of them is a terrorist. And now I'm racing to find out who they are before they strike again. 
 My son made a plan... an attack. He's up for parole. 
 Charlie, who did this to you? 
 Clayton : Your girlfriend. 
 Been giving away money to a woman she says is her sister. 
 You got what you wanted... setting me up. 
 I got a call from someone. 
 They disguised their voice. I had no choice. 
 Hey! 
 It's safe. You can let it go. 
 Alex : We found the bomb. 
 [Explosion] 
 The bomb in the hotel was a decoy. 
 But what was his plan? What blew up? 
 Alex : The Command Center. 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 [Clears throat] 
 I believe that Elias Harper did not act alone. 
 I was there in that hotel room, and I know in my heart that every word about his being manipulated is true. 
 That was Special Agent Alex Parrish giving her first day of testimony at the hearing  to investigate the deadly attacks in New York City more than three months ago. 
 Parrish still believes that Harper, the man the FBI Claims is responsible for the deaths of hundreds, including 32 FBI agents, was actually just the fall guy for a terrorist mastermind who remains at large. 
 And now her claims are gaining widespread acceptance. The FBI is just going after Alex again, but she'll prove everyone wrong,  just like after Grand Central. Woman : That's making Parrish, the FBI's former most wanted, also its most controversial. Many in Washington feel Parrish is just playing on people's fears... that includes vice presidential candidate Claire Haas. Her husband, Executive Assistant Director Clayton Haas, was one of the 32 agents killed in the second attack. There is no doubt in any reasonable person's mind that, despite his claims, Elias Harper acted alone. You can put the game back on, Mike. And I, along with my colleagues... [Indistinct conversations] On the house. Keep your chin up. Thanks. Can I buy you another? My drinks are free, and you're not my type. Really? ♪ Pretty, if the sun won't shine ♪ All right. How 'bout I list five things about you to prove that I'm right and if any of them are false, you get to sit down and buy me a drink. Go. One, you're vain. You just had your teeth whitened a couple months ago instead of getting that cavity filled in your bottom right molar... shows up when you smile. Two, you're materialistic. That Bremont on your wrist probably costs more than I make in a month, which brings me to three... you do this a lot. Your friend over there bailed as soon as we started talking. You're used to girls falling all over you in bars, even though, four, you've never really had a meaningful relationship. No one's ever broken your heart 'cause you've never let a woman close enough, which tells me, five, you're bad news. You're not interested in anything real. So I, uh, can't sit, then? [Inhales deeply] No. You don't get to sit. But... ♪ You're just too good to lose ♪ 
♪ And I can't refuse ♪ 
♪ So don't make me choose between the two ♪ [Breathing heavily] Okay. Stop. Stop. What? Did I do something? I'm sorry. It's just that I can't. I can't. Uh, at least let me get your number. You know, I'm the CTO of a telecom company. With my clearance, I can get any number I want... even yours. We'll see about that, now, won't we? [Sighs] ♪ Now you've come this far to meet me ♪ Pollard : The second half of your training begins now, and it's not gonna get any easier. Parrish, you're dragging. [Sighs] Good form. Keep it up. What happened to us? We used to be the top in our class at P.T. We just let ourselves get distracted. Have you heard from Booth? No. Nothing. [Sighs] You're lucky. Being followed around by your ex all day gets old fast. Well, so is being booty-called by Bitmoji every night. That's it. Starting right now, the only thing we focus on is our training. We block out all the noise. Preach. [Whistle blows] Let's go. Maxwell : Do you remember what any of your kidnappers looked like? I already told my mom. They had me blindfolded the whole time. Did they have accents? American. Nothing special. [Sighs] Why don't you tell me about your escape? There's nothing much to say. They didn't tie me up tight enough. Charlie, Agent Maxwell is just trying to find the men who did this to you. Well, ma, I can't remember what I can't remember. Why don't you step outside for a second? Let me talk to Agent Maxwell alone. [Door closes] How's your family? I still remember the look on your mom's face at graduation. Look, Miranda. He's tired. I know. He hasn't slept for days. I know. He just needs more time. The terror cell that took Charlie is part of the Islamic front. We believe they're planning an attack here, as we speak. Out of respect for you and everything you taught, I can give you one more day. But if Charlie doesn't start bringing us names, faces, I'm gonna need to bring him down to the field office, and you won't be allowed to be present. [Keyboard keys clacking] ♪ ♪ [Clears throat] I just came to ask what you want me to do with the 40,000 Saudi Riyals that have been sitting in my account for a week, courtesy of your half-sister, all-con-artist, Samar. Caleb, I can't right now. Just leave me alone, okay? Tidying up? I came here with a lot of questions. Got the answers that I needed. A clean slate... that's a powerful thing. You know, you once said I was the best. Well, saying goodbye to this is the only way I can be again. We doing this? Now or never. ♪ ♪ Alex : What's going on? Miranda : Trainees, meet the class above you. They are one month ahead of you in their training, which means they're better, faster, and smarter than you. And more prepared for what's to come. Take a good look, 'cause these are the people that are gonna spend the day kicking your ass. In the field, you will face off against enemies who are always one step ahead of you. That's why, today, you'll face off with a class of nats that is that step ahead. We like to think of this as Quantico's version of color wars. Or, as I like to call it, the turning point. The grading for this exam will be very simple. The winning class will choose five from the losing class to go home... [All groaning] Any trainee they want. So, good luck, and may the best class win. [All murmuring] We got this. ♪ ♪ [Knock on door] The hearing's in 30 minutes. We can't be late. I know. I'm nearly done. How much do you miss JTTF right now, huh? Yeah, I love orphaning my cases for a babysitting detail. What are you doing? Comparing Elias's cellphone records that the Bureau submitted as evidence against those of the cellphone company's internal records to see if there have been any omissions or keystroke errors. You know, I mean, mistakes happen... I'm living proof. You know, if you change your statement, you can come back to work. No, no, no. The only reason why I'm not at work is because Liam and Miranda put me on "trauma leave." And you know what? I was in that hotel. I was with Elias. I heard what he said. I... So did I. And I spent weeks, along with Ryan, Shelby, Simon, the twins, and The Bureau, trying to find a single piece of evidence that supported the mastermind theory, and there wasn't any. He made it up to stall us. He just wanted to get everyone into the bank that mattered. Just because you don't find evidence doesn't mean there isn't any. We need to find the needle. There is no needle. If there was a second terrorist out there, something else would have happened by now. [Police radio chatter] You'll tell Alex Parrish what I said? Cop : Why don't you come down? And you can tell her yourself. I can't do that. I'm sorry. Stop! [Distorted voice] Listen very carefully. There's a bomb underneath Grand Central. It was placed there by an FBI agent, part of a class that entered Quantico last September. I understand the bureau has assembled a version of this 911 call with the voice unscrambled. May we hear that now? [Normal voice] Listen very carefully. There's a bomb underneath Grand Central. It was placed there by an FBI agent, part of a class that entered Quantico last September. You need to evacuate immediately. Do you recognize the voice on that recording, Mr. Asher? [Camera shutters clicking] Elias Harper. He blew up Grand Central, and then, four days later, he blew up the FBI's emergency command center. [Camera shutters clicking] And do you believe Elias Harper acted alone? Let me remind you we are an impartial committee, and it's important the views you express here today are yours and yours alone. I'll ask again... Do you believe Elias Harper acted alone? Yes, sir. I do. [People murmuring] Mr. Asher, how are you so certain? Because I've spent the last three months of my life taking apart everything Elias ever said to me. I walked away from the bureau... This city... My entire life, all so that I could make sense of what happened. And there is not a doubt in my mind that Elias Harper acted alone. He hated the FBI. He made his career taking apart their cases in court. The attacks were Elias' way of making a statement, and 32 agents paid the price for it. [Camera shutters clicking] ♪ ♪ This may seem like a game, but I can assure you it is not. Each trainee will be scored individually. At the end of the day, the scores will be tallied for each class. Whichever class has the most points wins. Whichever class loses has five members sent home. [Whistle blows] Don't forget they vetted our applications for background checks. They know us, but we don't know them. Well, I guess we better level the playing field. Melissa in admissions still have that crush on you? ♪ He can bring it, bring it all day long ♪ 
♪ All over my lemon wong ♪ [Locker door slams] ♪ Nobody will get to see ♪ Alex : Drew Perales... born in Humboldt Park, drafted in the first round by Chicago, but retired after just two seasons to lead a class-action lawsuit against the NFL. Need to be pretty fearless to go up against the NFL. Hmm, sounds like a man who's not afraid of a good fight. Pollard : Parrish, Perales... you're up. You're Alex? Relax, tebow. Blow the whistle. ♪ ...this fat lady sings ♪ [Whistle blows] ♪ And when I see his face ♪ 
♪ I feel like I could win the race ♪ 
♪ and when he calls... ♪ Dr. Will Olsen... got his PhD from Harvard at 22. Antisocial tendencies include gaze avoidance and obsessive verbal memory. He worked at the jet propulsion laboratory at NASA. Oh, great. Yeah, he's literally a rocket scientist. ♪ ♪ Caleb Jacob Haas... born December 17, 1990, in Chevy Chase, Maryland, to Clayton and Claire Haas. Graduated sidwell friends at the bottom of his class. Okay, rocket man, here's how this is gonna go down. I'm gonna smack you around a little silly, and you're just gonna try not to bruise too much, okay? ♪ And when I leave him for ♪ 
♪ I couldn't ask for any more ♪ Liam : The man who cracks the firewall first wins 10 points for their class. ♪ He won me, game, set, and match ♪ [Keyboard keys clacking] [Beeps] Okay, here's how this is going to go. I'm gonna slap you around a little silly, and you just try not to bruise too much, okay? ♪ You can look, girl, but you can't touch ♪ Did I do something to offend you? Or is this how you got half the guys on campus to fall in love with you? Said the guy who posed nude for men's health. I had a sock on only 'cause I was cold. You shouldn't talk too much. It slows down your breathing. So does pacing yourself so you can do this... [Gasps] When the time comes. Shelby : Iris Chang... born in Shanghai, raised in Beverly Hills. Graduated valedictorian from Harvard-Westlake and enrolled at USC where she founded six startups and successfully sued all her business partners out of their shares. Sorry. Forgot to take my rings off. She fights dirty. ♪ When he calls my name ♪

♪ I wouldn't send ♪ 
♪ I wouldn't send him back ♪ [All cheering] ♪ He won me, game, set, and match ♪ [Cheering continues] ♪ ♪ Hey, Mom sent that care package. That's nice. But you didn't want to bring it back with you after New Year's? It was too much to take on the plane. Wait. I thought you drove. [Exhales sharply] Why are you interrogating me? Miranda, how is Charlie doing? Miranda : He won't talk to me. He won't talk to the agents. I don't know what he's afraid to say, but we need answers. How about letting me try? I've been researching the Islamic front. We need the experience. You invited Samar here? Are you spying on me again? She messaged me, asking if I ratted her out, and I said no. Thank you. So, what's your play? What do you mean? I mean, what's your play? You're dealing with a con artist. You can't just confront her. You have to con her back. Caleb, I can do this on my own, and I want to. Miranda : We've done this color wars exercise 20 times since I've been at Quantico, and this is only the third time that the two teams have been tied. What? Which means we're going to conduct one final exercise... class against class. Get your guns. You're going to Hogan's Alley. Upper class, since you've done this drill before, you'll be the hostage takers. Lower class, you will be the HRT team deployed to apprehend them and save the five hostages from this warehouse. The rules are simple... kill or be killed. [Sighs] Shelby. Stay away from me. You don't mean that. I've left you dozens of messa... Just stop. We have nothing to say to each other. You destroyed my life, my career at the bureau. I had nothing to do with that. Because of you, every single person in this city knows that I slept with my boss, the next vice president's late husband. My face was on the cover of every paper, every tabloid. I had to move back to Georgia just to get away from the paparazzi. Everything that I had accomplished up to that point was wiped away, and according to you, it was for nothing, because we didn't get the bad guy. You weren't in that room with Elias... I was. No, you're right. I... I was in the room with 100 people who barely got out alive as the walls were caving in on us. I was in the room with the 32 people who didn't get out alive, some of whom I tried to save with my own hands but couldn't, including Clayton. And now... I am being forced to defend my actions because you won't let this go. I'm the same person, Shelby. You used to believe in me. Now I know that I was wrong. Agent Parrish? [Sighs] [Sniffles] Yes? [Clears throat] I'm sure you've heard about Duncan Howell. Duncan Howell? N-no, I haven't heard. He took his own life [Sighs] last night. Before he did, he asked me to deliver a message to you. [Exhales sharply] He said, "Tell her... I thought I didn't have a choice." Does that mean something to you? Deckerman : Assistant Director, when Harper was a trainee at Quantico, were you concerned about his mental health? No, I was not. Interim Deputy Director, I'll ask you the same question... were you ever concerned? No, Mr. Chairman, I was not. Now, did either of you ever see Harper display any violent attitudes or opinions, either before or after he was dismissed? Mr. Chairman, Miranda and I will blame ourselves for not seeing the signs in Harper for the rest of our lives. His contempt for the Bureau's cases, his grandiosity, his need for admiration, his pointing the finger at others to deflect anyone from looking at him... we see those signs now, but we should've seen them then. In your opinion, did Elias Harper act alone? Yes. Yes. Now, we've heard from over a dozen of your agents, and they all say the same thing, except for one. Why does Alex Parrish, an agent that you once described as a bright star, disagree with you? Alex Parrish was one of the finest Agents I've ever trained. If anyone's to blame for her delusion, it's the bureau itself. After the Grand Central bombing, we fell for Harper's plan to frame her. Turned her into a fugitive. We broke her. [Camera shutter clicking] He backed you, in his own way, even though you hijacked his entire agenda. He's under a lot of pressure from the White House to close this case. Even if it means selling the public a lie? I read the report, Alex. There's not a shred of evidence to support what you believe. What about... what about Duncan Howell, the hacker who helped me discover the second bomb? Before he jumped, Miranda, he told the cop to tell me, "I thought I had no choice." Someone got to Duncan, probably the same person who got to Elias. What you're doing is not healthy. Not everything is a conspiracy. Miranda, we're still not safe. You have to believe me. I'm telling you. Elias knew it was someone from our class. That's how they knew how to frame me. Alex, the thing about being an agent is that you cannot always think that you're right. You were right about Charlie. You should know better. Hey. Is your mother around? I'm Nimah. Which game are you playing? The box. You're stuck in a room, and an FBI trainee is sent in to interrogate you on the D.L. [Chuckles] You're very clever. But Miranda didn't send me... I volunteered. So? Your mother is worried. She knows you wouldn't talk to her about what's happened. Would you be more comfortable talking to me? I don't know you. You don't know me. And you sure as hell don't know the people who took me. It's a miracle that I am alive right now. And I'm not saying a word to jeopardize that. [Sighs] Let me try. You interrogate him? Are you serious? I've been pushing your buttons my whole life, haven't I? Man : All right, let's go. This may be a drill, but our careers are on the line, and they have the advantage on us. It's us versus them. We win... we stay. They win... five of us go home. Which means there's no room for error. We need everybody doing what they do best. Let's do this! [All shouting] 
 
 ♪ ♪ I've got a sentry on lookout. South entrance. Iris. North entrance secure. I need my eyes in the sky, Caleb, now. Okay. I got eyes on the hostages. It looks like they're on the east side of the warehouse, and I count 1, 2, 3 bags of cash in the back. You say when, I say dead. Clear to fire. Ding-dong. The witch is dead. Sentry down. Clear to breach. Wyatt just took out Iris. Good. Now we know they're following the HRT playbook to the letter. Approaching the south entrance. Approaching north entrance. Caleb, what are we looking at? North and south entrances are all clear. Hostage takers are still in the east wing. And I still got my Mr. Robot Swagger from my analyst days. Good shooting, Tex. Sit tight, sweetie, and watch us take down the rest of your friends. Ready to breach on my command. Sounds good to me. [Sighs] Remind you of anything? Grow up. [Chuckles] 3... 2... 1. Move, move, move. Moving toward hostages in the east wing. [Paintball guns firing] We've got company. When you said cleared, you forgot to mention the nats waiting for us inside the damn door! What do you mean? I'm looking at the feed right now. It's all clear. I have company, too. What's going on? You've got to be kidding me. They hacked the CCTV footage. They put our live feed on a loop. They're cheating. [Indistinct shouting] That doesn't explain how they knew exactly when we'd breach. Iris: Because, while you were flying blind,  we've heard every word. Do you think we didn't know you'd take me out first? Everybody, double back now. It's an ambush! [Indistinct shouting] Aah! Man : Man down! [Knock on door] [Sighs] [Clears throat] You gonna invite me in? Yeah. Come on in. Um... It's a nice place. You needed a change? [Scoffs] [Chuckling] Yeah, well, when a terrorist builds a secret passageway into your apartment and frames you for mass murder, burning a little sage doesn't really cut it. [Chuckles] W-why are you even here? I mean, you haven't returned my e-mails or my phone calls or my texts for... for months. [Sighs] Brian Goldman. Brian who? The guy you hooked up with last night... tall, good-looking, works for a telecom company... ring any bells? Look, we know you stole his key fob. First, you looked into Elias, and now you're looking into Duncan. Alex, when's this gonna end? Fine. Tell Brian Goldman it wasn't personal. Ryan : Duncan Howell killed himself. The bureau's not treating his death as suspicious. Yeah, well, neither am I. No? You're just searching through his cellphone records trying to find a better data plan? I was trying to find Mia. Duncan was my friend. He risked his life for me... and for you, too, from what I remember. And I don't care what you say... he did not kill himself. Someone got to him, Ryan. Alex, you're... I'm what? Say it. Say it. You think I'm crazy. Everyone else at the bureau said it... your girlfriend, Natalie. She's not my girlfriend anymore, and you know that. Only thing I know is that I'm not wrong about Elias, and a lot of other people out there think so, too. They only think that because they believe in you, Alex. And I believe in you, too. I believe you'll make the right decision once you see this. It's a copy of the plea deal that Duncan signed with the district attorney's office four days ago. He pled on two counts... unauthorized access and computer fraud... in exchange for a reduced sentence of 7 to 10 years. Duncan was going to jail? That's why he killed himself. Alex, there was no boogeyman. There was no mastermind. I don't think that you're crazy. I think... [Sighs] I think you're in pain. I think that you went through something awful, something that doesn't even make any sense, but that doesn't change the fact that Elias killed all those people. I know there is someone else, Ryan. You didn't hear Elias. He was so scared. He was so ashamed. He wasn't lying. He just wanted someone to forgive him. Ryan. [Sighs] I came here as a favor. I thought, maybe, given our history, that I might be the one to finally get through to you, but... I can't, 'cause this isn't about the truth... this is just about you. Ryan, I... [Door closes] Alex, we need to fall back. I can't override the security hack. If you stay, you're flying blind. I can't. They've covered all the exits. Unless someone makes a decision soon, it's game over, anyway. No one's going home. We're staying, we're fighting, and we're getting out alive, with the hostages. Roger that. If we're flying blind, so should they. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Fire at will! [Indistinct shouting] [Grunts] Woman : I'm down! Three more confirmed kills. No sign of the hostages. Reload. Get down! Enemy down. 14 to go. Brandon : One more for the team. [Laughs] [Indistinct shouting] Well, it looks like your little plan didn't work out so well. You guys still don't get it, do you? We already won. No sign of the hostages or the money. Hold your fire. Look, they set us up. I don't know how, but they did. What's going on? You guys killed four hostages while the bad guys were running out the back with the money. Alex : They dressed up the hostages so we'd shoot them. They broke the rules. Criminals don't play by the rules. Because there are none. That doesn't mean that they can hack the CCTVs. You mean unlike the 900 CCTVs hijacked by that botnet last year, or pretty much any nanny cam ever, or Ariana Grande and the doughnut shop. Okay. I want you on my team on trivia night, but that's it. This is so unfair. Poor little righteous rich girl. I vetted you, remember? Why don't you vet this? Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Enough! You're angry. Good. Stay angry. Remember why you lost today. Every time you step into a perpetrator's apartment or a trafficker's hideout, they have home-field advantage. They will have had a lifetime to prepare for a fight. You have 60 seconds. You can't let them send five of us home over this, Liam. I'm sorry. [Camera shutters clicking] Over here. Move over here please. Deckerman : We are now back in session. Thank you, Agent Parrish, for returning to us this afternoon. I was subpoenaed, Congressman. It is essential that we hear all of your thoughts. Now, I've been told that you have prepared a statement. Yes, I have. You may proceed. "To my friends and family, my fellow agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and my fellow New Yorkers who've suffered these unspeakable tragedies... I know how painful these past few months have been for all of us. And I know many of you in this room blame me for what you see as prolonging your suffering. You say I've divided a city because I don't accept your explanation, which is why we can't move on from those two fateful days in July. But I won't apologize for that. I can't. The search for truth isn't easy, and when I joined the bureau, I took an oath to support and defend our country... Which is why I'm reversing my position today. Man : What? Woman : What? What? No. I can find no evidence that contradicts the bureau's findings that Elias Harper acted alone. It's time for all of us to move on. [Camera shutters clicking] Alex, don't give up.

We didn't break the rules... you did. Are you saying we had something to do with this? Yeah. Of course you did. Back up. Or what are you gonna do... give me a fake scar? Trainees, trainees. That's enough! As some of you may already know, the five that were expelled this morning were cut from both classes. Why? Because we know that the exercise was not fair. So...

She told me. When I was in high school, I wrote an article. It was for the school's newspaper. It was about the spy planes that were always flying over our community in Dearborn. Three days later, the FBI rushed in during homeroom, and they interrogated me for 10 hours. What did you tell them? I told them that I am an American citizen and that I loved my country, but all people can see is this. I have no idea what you mean. I'm a 19-year-old black kid with priors. I sneeze, and everyone on the plane has a heart attack. Try asking a stranger for directions. Try buying a bag of fertilizer for your vegetable garden. [Both chuckle] You haven't been sleeping, have you? When you sleep, you're back there with the men who took you, right? Men? Two of them were my age. How many were they?

Woman 2 : We believed in you and you li... [Scoffs] [Cellphone ringing] [Sighs] [Ringing continues] Hello? [Distorted voice] It was so sad seeing you lie up there today, Alex... Especially when I'm the only person who knows you were right... Because I'm the one you've been looking for all along. Hello? Who is this? [Distorted voice] 227 West 10th. Come alone. [Sighs] Where's Brandon? Oh, no, this is our punishment. We don't just get mixed classes, but we all get new roommates, too. And [Whistles] Since you can't pick up on social cues, how about this? Yeah, there you go. Go build a robot. Uh, all right. What'd you find? I did an ISP search on all the e-mails that Khaled gave us... and, um, you're wearing my shirt. Do you want it back? [Sighs] No. I don't know who's sending these e-mails, but I figured out where they're coming from... Croatia. ♪ ♪ In this job, you will make a lot more enemies than you do friends.

[Cellphone rings] Alex : What do you want, and why am I here? [Distorted voice] All this time you've been helping me do what needed to done, and I've never been able to say thank you. I've never been able to ask how you were doing. You're strong, but I never realized how strong. It's impressive. The first time I saw you at the academy, I knew what you were capable of... what we were capable of. But our relationship took time. And now here we are, three months after Grand Central, a year after Quantico, and you're still helping me. Helping you do what? Finish what we started. Look at your phone. Tell her I had no choice, like Elias Harper. She'll know what that means. You don't have to jump. Come down so we can talk. No! Duncan disobeyed me, but you won't. [Metal clangs] Who's there?! [Siren wailing in distance] You weren't the terrorist before, but now you're going to be. Listen closely, Alex.
