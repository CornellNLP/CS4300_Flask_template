 Jimmy : What would you do with a second chance? 
 Before you answer, let me give you some advice. 
 Second chances can be a real monster. 
 [Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Bad Moon Rising" plays] 
 I'm gonna call the police. 
 No need for that. 
 ♪ I see a bad moon rising ♪ 
 That same music over and over. 
 I'm gonna get the cops up here. 
 FBI. Will that do? 
 ♪ I see trouble on the way ♪ 
♪ I see earthquakes and lightnin' ♪ 
 Neighbors are complaining about the noise again, Dad. 
 ♪ I see ♪ 
 Why don't you go ahead and let me have that smoke, too? 
 Come on. 
 I was having a lot more fun before you showed up. 
 It's 3:00 in the afternoon. 
 Are you planning on getting dressed today? 
 I will take it under advisement. 
 What's all this? 
 Is this my case? 
 You're working my case now? 
 [chuckles] Someone has to. 
 Six bank jobs in 12 months, dead security guard, nobody locked up for it. 
 [chuckles] In my day, we would've done... 
 What needed to get done. 
 Yeah, I'm pretty much aware of that. 
 [toilet flushes] 
 [keys jingle] 
 Dad, is somebody else here? 
 Oh. Hey. 
 I was just on my way out. 
 Duval, this is Bettina. 
 Bettina is a member of my, uh, music appreciation club. 
 We meet once a week. 
 Don't worry. 
 He's too old to really do much of anything. 
 And how much does not really doing much of anything cost him? 
 Don't answer that! 
 It's impolite to talk about money. 
 My son should know that. 
 Don't be rude, Duval. 
 I'll see you. You know where to find me. 
 Oh! Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Oh, geez. 
 Are you here for the music appreciation club? 
 The music... I'm sorry. The what club? 
 Gracie, I thought I told you to wait in the car. 
 Well, I wanted to come say hi to Grandpa. 
 I'll see you next week. 
 Who was that? 
 No one. Gracie, as long as you're here, go ahead and empty the rest of that bourbon in the kitchen sink. 
 Grandpa, what does the doctor say about mixing your meds and bourbon? 
 Oh, that I had to give one of them up. 
 Can't remember which one. 
 Oh, you know, I used to have a lot more records. 
 You know what happened to them? 
 Yeah, they're with the boxes from when we shut down your house... after Mom died. 
 Ah. 
 They're up in our attic. 
 I can go up there when we get back. 
 Remember? Dad's taking me on a College Gracie tour. 
 You can take the time? 
 It's two days with my daughter. 
 I've been on this case for a year. 
 You know best. Kiddo. 
 Gracie, come on, let's go. 
 Okay. 
 I, uh, I poured a little of the bourbon into a glass by the sink. 
 Oh, you are an understanding child. 
 Gracie? 
 You'll always be the Sheriff. 
 [chuckles] 
 Don't let your father hear you say that. 
 He doesn't like it. 
 [both chuckle] 
 I'll see you later.

 I thought maybe it was anxious. 
 Maybe it's a bit of both. 
 The board needs me to do interviews to ease the shareholders' minds. 
 They'll ask what you've been doing, Otto. 
 [speaking twin-speak] 
 Not in twin-speak, Otto. In English. 
 You won't tell them, will you? 
 No. 
 I won't tell them. 
 It works with the fish. I want to go to human trials. 
 After mice, rats, and chimps. You know that, Otto. 
 But we can't wait. 
 You're too sick, Mary.

 Jimmy : What the hell are you doing in my son's office?! 
 Just take it easy. 
 I asked you a question. 
 Answer me! 
 Look me in the eye! 
 Or we will both find out if I remember how to throw this knife. 
 No, don't do it! 
 Unh! 
 [groans] 
 Man : Get what we need. 
 Clean this place up like it never happened. 
 Go to hell! 
 I got a better idea, Sheriff. 
 You were depressed, drinking too much. 
 [grunts] [coughs] 
 After what you put your family through. 
 I'm surprised it took you so long to do it. 
 All right, get him over! 
 What? 
 Do it! 
 He's seen our faces! 
 Come on, man, do it now! 
 My son will catch you! 
 No, Mr. Pritchard, he won't. 
 [gasps] 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 [guns cock] 
 [police radio chatter] 
 Reporter : In what is being ruled  a suicide,  ex-King County Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard took his own life nearly 15 years after stepping down from his office in the wake of a widespread corruption scandal. 
 Pritchard is survived by two children and one grandchild. [beep] 4-year-old Otto Goodwin, unable to connect with the world around him, constructed a private language consisting of over 3,000 words. His twin sister, Mary, was the only person he taught it to. He would speak to her. She would speak to the world. Within a few years, he would give Mary the algorithm for Lookinglass, and she would turn it into a $10-billion social-media giant. Morgan : Mary, when you and your twin brother started Lookinglass nearly 10 years ago now, did you ever imagine you'd end up with a billion users? Otto wrote that code to help people connect. That number one billion shows how hungry people are to connect with each other. But human connection is something that Otto has always struggled with, and he spoke only to you till he was 9 years old and then only the language of his own invention. And people are saying two things. I want to put these to you very strongly tonight. The obvious question for you... Otto : Come on, Mary. ...is Otto burnt out? Say yes. Can Lookinglass survive without him? Say yes. Otto's become very distant, almost disappeared off the face of the Earth,  and his absence has created a vacuum where competitors can pounce into the market. I'm sorry, Otto. Mary says no. Why? Doesn't she know that by the time we find another donor, it'll be too late? Why would she say no?! You know why, Otto. Your sister still hasn't given the go ahead for human testing. But it's the only thing that'll save her! ...a lot of waiting. Arthur, how long will Mary be in New York? She has one more day of interviews. Okay. He's essentially just disappeared. Okay. Most concerning... Switch the serial numbers. Procure the body. She is going to be angry. You know that. ♪♪ [beeping] [beep] [ping] [monitor beeping] What did you do, Otto? Please don't be mad. Arthur, terminate the process! Turn it off! Turn it all off now! Arthur : Yes, Mary. Give me a moment. Please, Mary, don't. We had no right to do this... to take a body without asking! Shutting down in 25 seconds. Please, Mary, don't! We need to send him back. He shouldn't be here! Please, let me just tell you who he is first. [beeping continues] It's who we've been waiting for. [beeping continues] You don't have to die, Mary. His genetic variation is 1 in 10 million. 15 seconds. It works with him, Mary. He's here to save us. Please don't leave me alone. My father, Jimmy Pritchard, was in the department for 30 years, and... they didn't even send a couple of lousy motorcycles. Without departmental honors. He didn't expect anything of anyone. Didn't expect anything of me. All right, that's... that's enough now, Helen. Mm! You've had too much to drink. Oh! [laughs] Well, it's the only thing he taught me. Meet me in my office. [cabinet closes] You remember the guard they killed on the first job? You've got to be kidding me, partner. We're not working today. I got to thinking, maybe he was in on it, and they were cleaning up when they killed him. So I pulled his phone records. Okay. Pulled his phone records, and... Nothing connects him to it. Why can't we get these guys? Duval, that's for tomorrow. Today's about your family, your dad. My dad would've wanted me to work today, believe me. His cells, recoded for optimum growth and capacity, will allow us to begin Mary's treatment on schedule. Arthur : Otto, may I ask a question? What is it, Arthur? If the specimen in the tank regains consciousness, what should I refer to him as? Jimmy Pritchard is dead. Refer to him as... Proprietary Goodwin Technology. Should I run that name by Mary? [telephone ringing] [glasses beeping] [indistinct conversations] Mary? Your oncologist is on the line. Thank you, Doctor. As always, I appreciate your discretion. [breathes deeply] What's our current price per share? $476.98. Still holding even... good. The interviews you're doing have stabilized the stock. Let's line up some more. Set a meeting with P.R. Right away. Ted talks have always wanted you, as well. They've always wanted Otto, but they'll take me, so make that happen, and, uh... [sighs] Okay, Alexa. What's with the mother hen look? I'm sorry. Can I ask what the doctor said? My numbers are getting worse. Chemo still isn't working. Then is it time to let the board and the public know your ill and that your illness is what's distracting Otto and... Get ahead of the story? Of course, you've already considered everything. Otto's not ready for anyone to know I'm sick. I'm just your assistant. And this is probably not my place, but if the chemo isn't working, won't Otto have to start getting ready? There are no other treatments, are there? Phase one complete. Should I attempt to restore consciousness? [monitor beeping] Mom and Dad believed in God, Otto. They would've said what we're about to do should be left to God. [beeping continues] They would've said we'd be punished for what we're about to do. They would've wanted us to take care of each other. [beeping continues] From now on, no more decisions on your own. Do you understand? [beeping continues] I promise. Initiate phase two, Arthur. [beeping, electricity crackling] [guns cock] [camera shutters click] [beeping, crackling continues] [gasps] Mary, please restate. I am not programmed to recognize twin-speak. ♪♪ Phase two complete. [coughing] [sighs] [breathes deeply] Your cigarettes have been removed. [sighs, grunts] [sighs] And who would you be? My name's Mary... Mary Goodwin. I don't want you to be afraid. Do I look afraid? [grunts, coughs] So [coughs] did we, uh... do I owe you for something? No. You don't owe me anything. What are you doing in my apartment, Mary? You know this is your apartment? Good. That's really good. Yeah, I know this is my apartment. I want to know what you're doing in it. And why you took my smokes. Because they cause cancer. And what about your name? Can you tell me your name? Well, let's see. I've had it for 75 years. It's Jimmy Pritchard. What are you... some kind of... visiting nurse? Social worker? Is that it? Did my kids send you to check on me? Well, you can put in your report to my special agent son that I know who I am. I don't need anybody to take care of me. And I feel fine. I even got my appetite back. I thought you might be hungry. I made a sandwich for you. [muffled] Mmm, God, that's good. Usually, my teeth would bother me with something like this. [inhales deeply] [plate clinks] Mr. Pritchard, can you tell me the last thing you remember? Why is my hand like this? Who are you? His respiration rate is rising. Mary Goodwin. I'm here to help you. [birds chirping] Then why is my... hand not my hand, Mary? My voice sounds funny. Was there an accident? No. Not an accident. You've been through something, but it's going to be okay, I promise. What do you remember? [sighing] My son's house and... [sighs] ...a bridge. There used to be a mirror right here. Why did you take it down? Because we need to do this slowly. Do... what... slowly? I know you. Blood pressure 170 over 120. I know you. You're one of those... The hell are you doing in my apartment? I think we need to stop now, okay? No! [beep] We need to stop now, okay? Mary... You're gonna feel tired. ...get out of there! I need you to sleep. When you wake up, we can start again. Okay, but right now... Aah! I fell! [crying] I hit the ground! I... [crying continues] I hit the ground. [gasping] I died. Oh! [breathing heavily] [sighs] Why didn't the sedative release?! It did release. His body needed 12 times the prescribed amount. He's stronger than predicted. [birds chirping] We need to know how much. Keep him sedated until we run more tests. I can't. The capsule under his skin is now empty. [sighs] [sighs] [metal clatters] [grunts] [grunts] Jimmy : Open it! [pounding on door] Let me out! [grunts] [clattering] [alarm blaring] He's broken through the back wall of the room. He's in the house. [breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [sighs] [beep] Mary : We're offering you another chance. What? Why did you do this to me? You have a very rare genetic precursor which allowed us to recode and regenerate your cells. I don't know what any of that means, but this... this is  me.  But this isn't  me! This is the best version of you. You're the first to journey all the way back. To get another chance. [sighs] Don't you want it? [monitor beeping] With another chance, maybe you don't have to end it that way. [sighs] Is... is that what people think? They think I jumped... off that bridge? Your memory's been through a shock. You might not be ready to remember what you did. No! There was a break-in in my son's house. I caught them, and then they threw me off that bridge. No, wait. It was not a... not a... not a break-in. They were... they were looking for something, but... I was just an old man, so they just... tossed me like a bag of dirt. I was just an old man, wasn't I? I don't care if you believe me. My son is in trouble. [grunts] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [heart beating loudly] [bird cries] [insects buzzing] [wings whirring] [leash rattling] [dog growling, barks] 
 
 ♪♪ [dog barking] [breathing heavily] [dog growling] [dog panting] Nice day for a hike. Yeah, it is. Trainer, right? Gym or private? Private? What do you do... TRX, P90X, kettlebells, SLT? Because... you feel this? [sighs] No matter what I do, there's like 2% that I can't get rid of. Feel that. [birds chirping] Yep, I feel it. Are you taking new clients? [sighs] Um... no, not right now. Okay. See you then. [chuckles] ♪♪ Mary : He was in the Sheriff's department for 30 years. He'll try to find out who broke into his son's house. He'll try to solve the crime. Mary, I don't mean to disagree with you about Mr. Pritchard's current intentions, but my list of his priorities ranks law enforcement below women, alcohol, and music. [up-tempo music playing] [indistinct conversations] Hi! Hi. [chuckles] What? It's loud in here! Do I know you? No, but... I know a friend of yours. Jimmy Pritchard. He said you hang out here. Sheriff Pritchard killed himself. Yeah. Yeah, I read about that, but he said that if I ever need anything, that I should see you. And what do you want? I want to go to your place. You say you're a friend of Jimmy's? Uh-huh. I didn't see you at his funeral. You were at m... You were at the funeral? Yeah. How was it? Uh... real sad... I guess? No. There was hardly any weeping. Big turnout? Would you like to buy me a drink? [chuckles] The thing is, I'm kind of tapped out right now. And so concludes our time together. But... but I'm a friend of Jimmy's. Then you should understand the nature of our relationship. [up-tempo music continues] Don't move. Room's single use, bro. You look fit. You do kettlebells? Do I do kettle... Answer. [grunts] Found your secret. You a cop? I'm just gonna need your bankroll now, buddy. [groans] Huh, I'll have to get a handle on that. [up-tempo music continues] [chuckles] This will do.
