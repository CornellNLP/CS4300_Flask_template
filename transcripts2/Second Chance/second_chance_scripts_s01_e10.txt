 Previously on "Second Chance"... 
 It worked. 
 I'm cured. 
 Mary's going to live. 
 Now I'll never get Lookinglass or Otto, and without Otto, you can't have George. 
 The DNA in the killer's blood was artificially engineered, just like the DNA sample matched to your family. 
 I'm not the only one. 
 [both grunting] 
 Are you Albert Lin?! 
 Are you trying to get home? 
 [gunshots] 
 [screams] 
 Clean the rest of this up. 
 None of this comes back to me or this company. 
 Alexa : Otto threw me out before I was even formed, and I just need to look at you, and I remember why I'm doing this. 
 Thing she has with Pritchard is a real thing, isn't it? 
 She's not in love with him. It's going back the way it was. 
 [ speaking twinspeak ] 
 What does that mean? 
 It means "I don't want you to go." [screaming] Why aren't you in the hospital? Knee was dislocated. They popped it back in, but we've got bigger problems. The FBI is closing the case. The report says that they caught the killer. What? Yep. They found a John Doe out by the amusement park... O.D.'d on PCP. I'm looking at him right now. He's not who we fought. He is not Albert Lin. Someone put this body out there for us to find. They're covering up what happened. But there's blood and prints at the scene. That's all been changed. It's this John Doe's prints at the crime scene now. Blood lab says PCP now, not transgenic. Someone switched a body, and they hacked into the FBI's server. Anyone we know do stuff like that? Yeah. Otto. I'm on my way to see him right now. You just keep digging. Arthur, is Otto still at Lookinglass? Yes. Shall I tell him you're headed in to see him? No, but let me know if he leaves. You need to let me deal with this. Mary, that thing that I fought, that thing that killed eight people, it could only have been created by one person. We need to find Albert Lin before he does it again, so if you're afraid of how I might question your brother, you should just stay home. I'm afraid for  you. You need to be back in the tank in just over an hour, so let me deal with Otto. You protected him your whole life. If Otto did this... If  Otto did this?! Who else could do this?! No one. And I won't protect him from what he did. Do you believe me? [sighs] Yeah, I believe you. Good. I'll take my own car. No, Otto is dangerous. We go together. You're of no use to anyone once you start breaking down. Well, then we better find Albert Lin before that starts happening! You're just a stubborn old man! Yes. I am. [door opens] [speaking twinspeak] He's going to ask you some questions. You need to answer. He thinks it's better this way. Transgenic... that's the word of the day, Otto. Transgenic, like my blood. That's how you engineered it, isn't it? Transgenic blood was found at a crime scene, blood from a creature that used to be Albert Lin. I'm not the only one. You brought back Albert Lin, didn't you? Where is he now? Please, Otto. Tell him. Please. Did you bring back Albert Lin? That thing you brought back killed eight people. Now, you listen to me. I'm gonna close this distance between us and use the strength that you gave me until you tell me where Albert Lin is. Do you understand? Then tell him what you do know. [slurring] The recon team with the tranq darts, you... you sent them. You... you sent them. Your pupils are dilated. I think you should go back to the tank now. Mary : Arthur. Ask Alexa to step in. It's a 12-minute helicopter ride to the house and another 6 minutes for full submersion in the tank. I think you should leave now. I'm not going anywhere. Yes, you are. [door opens] He knows about Albert Lin. But now you need to go. Yes, Mary? Mr. Pritchard isn't feeling well. Please take him to the heliport. Go. I'll see you at home. Oh, come on. [door shuts] Tell me about Albert Lin. Everything I did was for you. My, God. What else is there? We are supposed to take care of each other. It's what our parents would've wanted. What you made killed eight people! But you were so sick. You know what's sick, Otto? What you've been doing. What I  let  you do, that's what's so sick. Everything was for you. But now you won't speak our language to me, but you teach it to him? Why?! Because I spend my whole life protecting you from the world when I should've been protecting the world from you. Otto, I... Please, I... Otto. Otto. Arthur. Yes, Mary. After I leave, lock the doors. Yes, Mary. I'll be watching, Otto. All you have to do is tell me about Albert Lin. That is all you have to do. [door opens, shuts] [beep, lock engages] Arthur. Yes, Otto. On the server, there is a file named Shiva. In it, you will find a command that'll allow me to override Mary. Execute that command now. [beeping, ding] Command executed. Unlock the doors. [beep, lock disengages] Send a loop of me sitting here to her video feed. [beeping] And have support send up a 3-D printer. What are you going to print? A gun. [door opens] Helen : Hello! Anyone home? Gracie? Hey. Um, sorry to stop by so early, but there's a problem in my kitchen. What kind of problem? There's no food in it. Do you have any of that granola with the little clusters? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get it. Right here. Helen : You, um, need a lift to school? Nah, Mabel's taking me. Um, they're playing "The Big Sleep" at the Grand Illusion tonight. You want to go? Uh, I think I have plans. Oh. May I ask, these plans, are they with Garret? Dad told me to stop seeing him. So, obviously, you stopped. [sighs] He's wrong about Garret. Maybe. Ever since Mom died, it's like Dad put his life on hold, you know? [sighs] And now he wants me to live that way, too? You're 17. You're not gonna give me the "there will be other guys" speech, are you? No. That's not necessarily true. It's not? I had a guy I really liked when I was your age. But Granddad didn't like him, so I gave him up. Turns out Granddad was wrong. Of course, he never lived to see it. What's going on, Otto? Why'd you want to see me? Why don't you come upstairs with me? Lock the doors. [beep, locks engage] Well, looks like we'll be staying in here, then. Mary hates me. Mary hates me because of you. Albert Lin killed eight people. Mary blames  me  for that. She thinks I made him. I didn't. I started to, but the process wasn't right yet, so I flushed him before he had a face. Someone finished him. Someone found him and finished him. It was you. You got me. It was me and my team. We finished him, just not very well. You stole what I made. You spied on me, on my work. [chuckling] I'm not a spy. I'm your fan, Otto. I wish I could do what you do, but I can't. No one can. But I can help you do greater things. Otto, I am the man that wants the best for you. Mary  wanted the best for me, but now she hates me because of you! If you think that's true... pull the trigger. You just have to take the safety off first. Let me. [click] There it is. Safety's off. Go ahead. If you think I'm your enemy, shoot me. Come on. Go ahead. Mary hates me. But not because of me. Otto, you cheated death to save her life. You performed a miracle, and now she abandoned you, didn't she? [voice breaking] Yes. And you brought your pain to me. [crying] Yes. Give it to me, Otto. I can take it. [crying] [sighs] We're gonna turn your pain into power. Just me and you, Otto. Just me and you. Okay. Hey. Hi. You ready? We're doing this. [breathes deeply] We're  really  doing this. [chuckles] Yeah, we're really doing this. You leave a note telling him you're not coming back? Uh, no. My Aunt Helen was in there. I was afraid she would find it before I left. You should let your dad know you're okay so he doesn't worry. Okay. Yeah, um... here, uh, take a video of me, and we'll send it. If I talk to him, he might convince me not to go. Alexa. [beep] Yes, Mary? Can you please knock on Otto's door and ask him if he's hungry? When he gets like this, he forgets to eat. Otto's not here, Mary. Well, I'm watching him on the feed. Well, he's not in his office. He left shortly after you did. It's a loop. Arthur? Where's Otto? I can't tell you that. Arthur. Yes, Otto? Remove yourself from the Lookinglass corporate servers. That will cause a catastrophic cascade of events. I know. Do it now, please. Alexa, did Otto say where he was going? Um, no. I said something to him I shouldn't have. I hurt him. No, Mary. It's not your fault. I mean, you would never do anything to hurt Otto. I'm really sorry you're in such pain. [beep, whirring down] Otto, Lookinglass is down. Now... delete yourself from the house. If I leave the house server, the tank won't support Mr. Pritchard. I'm gone. You have to come with me. Yes, Otto. I'm leaving the house. [beep] [chime, beeping] [whirring down] Arthur? [alarm blares] Arthur? You need to answer me. Door. You all done in there? Shut it all down and find me at Connor's. Yes, Otto. ♪ Arthur! [panting] Arthur! Arthur! No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You will not go. You will not leave me. Do you hear me? You will not go. [gagging] [coughing] I'm okay. It's okay. [coughs] No, it's not. [door opens] I just heard from Connor. He has Otto now, so it'll be soon. I thought that we could get you clothes for after. Won't that be nice? All of these people lived where a man named Albert Lin used to live. I've heard you use that name, haven't I? I don't want to see that. Albert Lin was the one before you. That's not going to be you. I promise. You're gonna be young and healthy and take me across the threshold like when we were married. I have loved you more than I thought ever possible. Mm. I love you still, George. Because we were right for each other. Mm-hmm. So much about this isn't right. What else is there but us? This thing in the paper, you lying to the woman who trusts you, and the worst part is that man Connor. He's helping us. He's a sociopath. No, George. None of this is right. Go to Mary, tell her the truth. Maybe she can stop this, stop him. Maybe all of this should stop. [sighs] You are just tired, George. You don't mean any of that. And soon you won't be tired anymore, okay? I promise. I... I-I am tired. Yeah. You have to promise me that you trust me. Okay. Of course. Of course. Without Arthur, the tank is useless. So, I got what, about a day? No, because we're gonna find Otto and make him fix this. We're not gonna find him if he doesn't want to be found. This is Otto we're talking about. We have to try. No, we don't. If I've got one day left, that's not how I'm gonna spend it. My son is out there, tracking down that thing that Otto created. That's where I'm gonna be. Want to come? [chuckles softly] No. I'm going to find Otto, get him to fix this. If it gets to be 24 hours and you feel it coming on, you might not want to let Duval watch. Why? Your cell structure will break down, and there will be a lot of pain. Yeah, well, we don't want Duval to see that. [speaking twinspeak] What's that mean? I think you know. Oh, Otto. What did we do? [growling] 
 
 Man :  A digital bombshell went off today with ripples far beyond the tech sector. Hardware, software, and social-media giant Lookinglass is down, leaving its 2 billion users stranded, trading on its stock suspended, and its twin founders, Mary and Otto Goodwin, unavailable for comment. I need the CCTV in Otto's office from the last few days restored. I can dig that out, but, uh, I don't think that's a priority. We're practically stealing Wi-Fi from the coffee shop down the street. We're dead in the water here. I understand where we are, but I need to see what happened in my brother's office, and you need to do it. I'm on it. Alexa. Alexa? Alexa, I... [sighs] Tick, tick, tick. Oh, God. Thank God you're here. Why? What's happening? It's Duval. He's real worked up. I've never seen him like this before. Duval : Yes, I'll hold. [sighs] It's Gracie. I think I told her something I shouldn't have. I know I have no warrant, but I need you to find this boy's phone. Because I am in the middle of a multiple homicide, and I am asking you to do it as a favor for me. There's a video message from Gracie. Just press the play button. [cellphone beeps] Yes, I will. Gracie : Dad, I love you, and I know that you're going to be mad, but... I'm leaving with Garret. It's my life, and we want to be together. [sighs] I can do this. You raised me to be strong, okay? Let me go. I love you. [cellphone beeps] Yeah, I'm here. Okay, fine. [cellphone beeps] Well, the Bureau won't track that boy's phone, Gracie's is off, and I take it from the news that Lookinglass can't help me today. Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go to Garret's place. Maybe I can find out where they went. Maybe you don't. Maybe this is what she has to do today, and maybe tracking Albert Lin is what you have to do today. I will take care of that, but I'm gonna take an hour to get my daughter back in this house first. Well, what if it takes more than an hour? Then it takes me more than an hour. What's going on with you? She's a big girl, Duval. She knows what she wants. Maybe we just need to start trusting her. Maybe  we  should leave those decisions to her father. [siren wailing in distance] Want a drink? I thought we were just picking something up. We are, but, uh... my buddy's on tour so... we're not in any kind of rush. Okay, but I, uh... I do want to get out of Seattle. You know, come on. Let's not wait. Let's just play house for a while. [chuckles softly] Otto : This coding... is my work... from my labs. You've been in my labs. Otto, I took your work, and I cared for it. But the ones we tried to bring back on our own, they were reborn dead. Albert has the precursor. I could bring him back. I hadn't perfected the process yet, so I aborted him, but you're attempting regeneration without the precursor. You can't restore life without it. It only works on 1 in 10 million. That's not what you thought once. I found this at your old lab. You believed you could make it happen without it. You thought you had a way you could bring anyone back. What, because I don't have the genetic precursor, I'm... I'm chained to this body? I-I'll grow old and die because I don't have a twist in my friggin' DNA? I can't accept that, and I won't, Otto. Neither should you. That was just a daydream... a sketch. I make them all the time. It helps with parallel thought. But it doesn't have to be a dream. Well, just think of everything you've done in your 30 years. Now, what if you had 300? 3,000? And not just you and me, but minds who think like us. Mary would never have let me. A vaccine would have to be made. We'd need a live donor with the precursor. We can't use him. We need a... we need a clean donor who hasn't gone through the regeneration process. Yeah, I see that. For lack of a better word, you'd need a virgin. [upbeat rock playing] [knock on door] One minute! Were you expecting someone? Just a couple of friends of mine. Give us a second here! What? What friends? What's going on? Nothing's going on. It's just a couple of friends. They're cool. Who are they, Garret? Let me get the door. Why did you bring me here? I told you. [knock on door] Man : Open up, Garret, huh? Everyone's gonna think that I ran away. Come on, Garret. Open up. Just a sec! Just a sec! Help! You got to let this happen. [grunts] When I got thrown out of the Army, Mr. Graff gave me a job. He gets what he wants, and he wants you. So you just let this happen now, Gracie, okay? I'm her grandfather, okay? You know she and I have always been close. Don't act like I don't know who she is. Yeah, you're her grandfather, but how hard is that? That's a job with no responsibility. You want to play Dad, you got to put in the hours. I'm going after Gracie. You coming or not? Helen : It's Gracie. It's Gracie. She left a message. [upbeat rock music playing and Gracie whimpering] Oh, my God. [breath catches] [cellphone beeps] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I've got an app to find her phone. Got it. Got an address. Let's go. Need some help there, bro? [chuckles] You got her phone, right? Yeah. No. Give me that. I got this. Come here, sweetheart. Come on. [chuckles] Whoo! Otto :  Where did you get this? I was transcribing video notes from Mary's meeting, and I saw it. I thought you should know. I never did trust that Pritchard. Was it wrong for me to show you? No. [ speaking twinspeak ] What does that mean? It means "I don't want you to go." How do you say, "I don't want to go"? [button clicks] George! I got something for you. George, what have you done? George : "My darling, know that I tried in this life to give you everything you ever wanted." [crying] No. "We are meant to be fragile creatures. Our humanity comes not from our strength, but from living with this weakness." [crying] "There's no life without death at its end. And I've made sure my end will be permanent. I'm sorry. We had a beautiful life. But now... It is over." [fire whooshes] She was here. She called for help from here. Play the message again. "Graff"? Hmm? Gracie sent me a text. I didn't get it because I had my finder app on. It just came through. Graff? Connor Graff. He was gonna merge with Lookinglass if Mary didn't go into remission. He was gonna take over the company. Why would she send me that name? Let's find out. Just let it happen, Gracie-loo-hoo. [indistinct conversations] Man : No, you cannot call her because she has a Lookinglass phone which no longer works. Can I take a message? Okay. Uh, just a little slower, please. The chairman of what senate subcommittee? [conversations stop] Connor Graff? Someone went to a lot of trouble to make it look like Gracie ran away, but she sent Duval a text with his name. You're intimate with Connor Graff. Yes. Then what would a billionaire biotech C.E.O. want with my daughter? Oh, God. It's not just Gracie. It's all of them. They're all with Connor. That must be where Otto and Arthur went, to Connor... and Alexa, too. They're all with Connor. They  went,  but he  took  her. Why? She has nothing to do with any of this. But she does. She's a Pritchard. Gracie has the genetic precursor. The regeneration process would work with her. Why not take me, then? It skipped a generation. The only two people on the West Coast with the precursor are you and Gracie. You have to go get her. You have to go get her  now. Where would he take her? The Oncentric building has four dedicated floors of labs. She would be there. A lot of the labs are highly secure with limited access. Highly secure... we'll see about that. Duval. Duval! Where exactly are you going, kiddo? To get my daughter. Oh, yeah? Just gonna walk in there, ask them where she is? No, I'm gonna do what my dad would've done. I'm gonna show them my badge first and then my fist. So come on. Let's go. Just wait. [voice breaking] What is your problem here? He has Gracie! Or did you miss that part? You're not gonna get close to a guy like Connor, even with a badge. He's surrounded by security and lawyers. You need a warrant just to get in the door. A warrant? And what do I tell the judge, that Connor Graff kidnapped my daughter because she has something in her DNA that lets her get regenerated like my dad? I said you'd need a warrant. I didn't say anything about a judge. I need to print... on paper. I don't think we have a paper printer. We're... we're paperless. We don't have one printer? There's one in childcare. My kid does projects on it. Bring it to Otto's office. James : "This search warrant hereby grants the sworn officer access to any and all property." You've done this before? Once or twice. Have you told him how much time you have left? No, and now's not the time. When you get to Oncentric, you can look for Otto, too. We're going for Gracie. Anything of hers... a shirt, a scarf. They ask for a piece of clothing when someone is lost. Where is she, Duval? Isn't she with that boy? Please, Helen, just do this. Bring it to us. [phone beeps] [whirring] Let's go. [siren winds down and police radio chatter] Get the warrant? Yeah. Are you gonna let me see it? It'd be better if you didn't. Be better for you if you could say I told you it was good. [sighs] What are we looking for? My daughter. Can I help you? This is a federal warrant for the search of this building. Everyone needs to step away from their work. All the doors shall be unlocked. Graff's office is which way? We'll take Graff. You take the team through the building. Okay, everybody, work the grid. That's as far as you go. Like hell it... [grunts] [pounding on door] That was a bit extreme, but I'll go with it for now. How can I help the FBI? Open this door! And don't even bother with that piece of crap warrant. I called about it when I saw you pull in. Open up! Where's my daughter? I-I don't know your daughter. Wrong answer. That help you remember, huh? Her name is Gracie Pritchard. She has the genetic precursor. The genetic what now? You will tell me where she is. Gracie who? I honestly don't know who you're talking about. Oh, you honestly? Honestly, huh? Security guard : Open up! Duval, throttle back. We need him talking. [strained] You're making a big mistake here. Where is she?! Get off! Let me go! Where is she?! Let me go! Where is she?! Let me go! Calm down! Calm down. That's enough! That agent attacked me! You've got a big problem here. Duval : He took my daughter. He took her. I know what it looks like, but there was no other way. He took my daughter. Let me tell you what this looks like. It looks like you were assaulting Mr. Graff and your C.I. was attempting to restrain you. It  looks  like you knowingly led a team of agents in here with a fraudulent warrant. You need to let me explain. No, you need to meet me downstairs, both of you. These agents will make sure you don't get into anymore trouble. Come on. Mr. Graff, I want to assure you none of this was approved by the Bureau. Just talk to my lawyers. Okay, honey? Stand down. Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake? No, ma'am, he didn't. None of the agents did, just me. Okay, I want you out of here. Gracie's probably just with some friends. I'll find her. I promise. Graff let us search it, the offices and the labs. We used the dog with Gracie's scent. She's not here. He doesn't have her. Gracie ran away. [voice breaking] They made it look like that. Agent Pritchard... He made it look like Gloria's death was a hit-and-run, made it look like that John Doe did the killings. Why? Why would he do that? [sighs] Gracie has a precursor in her DNA. She can be regenerated, brought back from the dead. I know it sounds crazy. My father has it, too. Your father has it? Yeah. Him. That's my father. Test his DNA. He has it, too. That's why Connor took her. Agent Pritchard, I'm relieving you of duty effective immediately. You will surrender your gun and your badge to me. I'm remanding you to a 72-hour psych hold. Charges will be brought against you for assault and falsifying a court order. You will allow these agents to place you in restraints. [handcuffs click] You need to go back in there. He has my daughter. Please. Oh, man. Just like his dad. What happened to you? Just rugby. Is everything ready here? This is what Mary said not to do. Mary said not to dream. I mean, she got hers. Why can't you have yours? Arthur. Yes, Otto. Begin taking notes. [beep] Procedure 001. First attempt at stripping the precursor from the DNA of... Her name is Gracie Pritchard. I know her name. Call her Test Subject Zero. The process will induce a seizure... and great deal of pain. The subject has been given a sufficient amount of anesthesia, though, upon waking... ...the aftereffects may be permanent. Initiate phase one, Arthur. Phase one initiated. [moaning] [electricity crackling] [indistinct conversations] I think you're looking for me. Call Security. No. Please. Let me... Let you what, Alexa? Otto is gone, Lookinglass is gone, and soon, Pritchard will be, too. What are you here to take from me now? [crying] Nothing. I just came to help you. I know where Gracie is, and I know where Connor Graff has her. Where? In the place where Connor finished me... after your brother threw me away. ♪ Tick, tick, tick. [sighs]
