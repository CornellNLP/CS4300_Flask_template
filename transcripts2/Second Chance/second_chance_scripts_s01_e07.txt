 Previously on "Second Chance"... 
 Woman : Disgraced Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard took his own life today. 
 You're the first to journey all the way back... to get another chance. 
 James : I know you. You're one of those rich computer Twins. 
 Otto re-coded your white blood cells to fight the cancer in my blood. 
 You brought me back to save you. 
 Otto : The donor grows much stronger than any of my models anticipated. 
 Why does he think he's my father? 
 Because he is. 
 I have more than six months to live now. 
 I don't want to prepare for my end anymore. 
 I need to call off the merger. 
 Now that the merger's off, I'm not going to be able to get Otto. 
 I need you to get me Otto's lab work and notes. 
 If I can't have Otto, I need his work. 
 Don't forget what you want. 
 [Beep] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Beeps] 
 [Beeps] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Beeps] 
 Can I help you? 
 [Slurring] Delexda. 
 Alexa. 
 But really close. 
 [Chuckles] This is amazing. 
 This... this is magic. 
 Poker night? 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 [Sighs] 
 It smells like there was drinking involved, as well. 
 Why are you here? 
 I'm dropping off paperwork for Mary. 
 I'll help you to your room. 
 Ooh. But I barely know you. 
 Here we go. 
 You're very strong. 
 I'm fine. I'm strong, you know? 
 All right. 
 I'm... I'm really... 
 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 [Beeping] 
 Arthur: Alexa, you're not authorized to be in this portion of the house. 
 Ignore him. He's not real. 
 Okay. 
 He's a computer, you know? 
 Okay. 
 [Groans] 
 All right. Here you go. 
 Yep. 
 Alexa, you're not authorized to be in this portion of the house. 
 Pipe down, Arthur. 
 She's just helping out an old man. 
 [Beeps] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I want you to be nice. 
 Why wouldn't I be nice? 
 Because Helen is bringing a man. 
 A man? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I always thought she was a, uh... 
 I just never... I've never seen her with a man. 
 Do you not remember what you did to every boy she brought around the house growing up? 
 If they just left running, we called that the Pritchard. 
 If they left running and crying, then they got the full sheriff. 
 That was for her own good. 
 Those high-school boys were all bad news. 
 Well, this is one of those high-school boys, so I'm warning you... just be nice. 
 Which one? 
 Wally Luskin. 
 Wally the weasel?! 
 He dealt weed and... and he drove a molester van. 
 I bet he got the full sheriff. 
 Look, she hadn't seen him in years. 
 They ran into each other a few months ago, and they hit it off. 
 She says that Wally has changed. 
 She needs this to work. Do you understand? 
 Uh, Duval, you remember Wally. 
 I do. 
 Been a long time. 
 It has. Good to see you. 
 And this is my other brother, Jimmy, I told you about. 
 Jimmy. Just like your dad. 
 I mean, the... the name, not... not that other way. 
 What other way? 
 Why don't we order some drinks. 
 Can we... 
 So, Wally, what do you do? 
 Wally is in law enforcement. 
 I'm a parole officer. 
 Parole officer? 
 A P.O. Uh, that's not law enforcement. 
 Duval : [Clears throat] 
 It's a very valuable service to the recently incarcerated. 
 That's what I told him. 
 You know, Wally gets down on himself, but he helps people who need it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] And... and Helen ran all the way home. 
 She did. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, we all went around, and we got her some wine. 
 You okay, Wally? 
 Yeah. Everything's great. Thanks. 
 It's the best egg foo yung in the city. You're not hungry? 
 Duval, come to the bar with me. 
 Let's get another round, huh? 
 Anybody want a drink? 
 Wally : Um, just a beer. 
 Helen : Yes, a beer. Thanks. 
 I think it's going really well. 
 A parole officer? That's not law enforcement. 
 You think she'd know better than that. 
 Why are we up here? 
 The waiter could have gotten more drinks. 
 He won't look me in the eye. You notice that? 
 Only people with something to hide do that. 
 Leave it alone. 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 [Sighs] Wally the weasel. 
 You run a guy off, and as soon as you're a little bit dead, he thinks he can crawl right back in. 
 [Beeps] 
 Aah! 
 Arthur, don't do that. 
 This location is not in your routine. 
 Are you lost? 
 [Sigh ] I'm following this guy in the car down the block. Helen and Duval thinks he's changed, but he's up to something. I saw it. Who's this guy? Arthur, can we listen in on that car over there? My technology is only available to you if you are performing a public service. Is it a public service? Yes, it's a public service. I can access the car's Bluetooth. Wally : How many more times? Jasper : What's it to you? I sign my name on your card, says you were with me when... when you weren't. Yeah, and you're getting paid for it. I know I'm... I'm getting paid. What are you moping for, huh? You got it the easiest in this. You sign your name, and the money goes in your account. Two more days and you're done. Now, you gonna sign my card? Arthur, is there any chance you recorded this? [Beeps] I have made a digital file and sent it to your phone. Attaboy. Wally: I sign my name on your card, says you were with me when... when you weren't. Jasper : Yeah, and you're getting paid for it. And don't get all Bill of Rights on me. Okay? I know I can't use it in court. But Helen's parole-officer boyfriend... he's taking money to alibi an ex-con. He's taking money to say he was with someone when he wasn't. Did you bring that list of Wally's parolees like I asked? Yep. Nope. Oh. Uh, no. No. Okay. No. Him. Yes. That's him. That's the guy. Jasper Willitz... robbery, armed robbery, assault, assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery. This guy runs crews. Look, he did the casino heist in Reno. He did the jewelry store in redmond. He's setting up a crew right now. Wally's a perfect alibi. I'll break it to Helen. I'll let you know when it's over. She's my kid. I can tell her. My old apartment, huh? Is it weird that she lives here? Not as weird as your living in the fake version of it in Mary goodwin's basement. What's the DVD? "The Notebook." She likes it. I'm using it to clean up your mess. My mess? I didn't break my oath as a law-enforcement officer. Lately. Hi. Hey, there. Come on in. [Sighs] Didn't want to leave any trace of the old man, huh? Oh, just the opposite. I actually moved here to, uh, feel closer to him. I think he'd love what I've done with the place, don't you? Yeah. I mean, he was always asking me to bring him more... crystals. So, what is the big announcement? I can't stand the anticipation. Well, Helen, it's like this. In life, there are two kinds of people. Wait a minute. Is that "The Notebook"? Oh, my god. What happened? What's wrong? Well, it's Wally... And, uh, he's on the take. What? That's how you tell her? Yeah, I mean, band-aid, zip, done. Duval, is that true? Say it isn't true. How do you know? Well, I followed him. And why would you do that? Why? He didn't seem right. Were you looking for something to get him for? He is breaking the law. Yeah, wow. I thought this was it. I... I thought Wally and I had found each other. Duval, is Wally a bad guy? Yeah. I think he is. You know, when dad kicked him out that time and I stood up for Wally... Dad called me an idiot. My own dad called me an idiot. And you know what? He was right. He was right. Just go. Both of you. Go! [Sniffles] [Door opens, closes] [Hair dryer whirring] I got into Otto's lab like Connor asked me, and I managed to get quite a bit of Otto's regeneration code. I'm just sending it to him now. There it goes. Yeah. You feel bad for betraying Mary's trust. I feel bad about betraying Mary, but... Otto threw me out before I was even formed. Connor just said I need to remember why I'm doing this. And I just need to look at you, and I remember why. Otto, listen, uh, the guy my daughter's dating... he's into something big. He's being paid off to alibi this ex-con. He... he's a parole officer. Uh, the weasel. We call him the weasel. Ja-Jasper, his parolee, is putting money into Wally's account. We just need to find out who else he might be paying. I don't think he's listening. Otto? Otto. Please step away from him. He's not talking to me now? He's not talking to anyone today. Duval : We could use his help to find out where that money's coming from. Not today. It's the anniversary of our parents' death. Otto doesn't talk on this day. I'm sorry. [Siren wails] I'm sorry to intrude, Mary. Let's go. Go where? How else do you plan on tracking that money? This is about your daughter? It's about an armed crew planning a hit somewhere in Seattle. But it... yeah, it's also about my daughter. And, duval, I'm assuming this isn't at the FBI because he's gotten you some kind of information you can't use. That's the size of it. What's your daughter's boyfriend's name? Wally Luskin. He's a parole officer. Arthur. Bringing up Wally Luskin's financial records. Oh. It's so illegal I shouldn't look. Any deposits? $120,000 in the last six weeks in $10,000 increments. Jimmy : Any idea where it's coming from? The money was moved through various banks, but its source is masked. It is a sophisticated security protocol I am unable to penetrate. What if Mr. Pritchard was going to force another transfer from the source? Yes, Mary. The digital trail would be open for a short time. I should be able to trace it. What are you two talking about, force another transfer? If you can find a way to reactivate Wally's accounts, there might be enough time to trace it back to the source. This is too sophisticated for that thug, Jasper. He's got somebody behind him, someone who knows what he's doing. Five years ago, you ran a $1 billion hedge fund. Then came the string of DUIs and finally the vehicular manslaughter. You haven't spoken publicly until now. What changed, Mr. Mellenburg? Tammi, thank you for asking. The short answer is that I'm dying, and... and that clarifies the mind. As you know, I received the maximum sentence... 25 to life... and with my diagnosis, I'll die here. I was angry at the judge who handed down my sentence. Now, uh... I see he was right. Right in what way? People need to pay for... for what they've done. My time in prison has taught me to be strong... To be able to face the truth. Without justice, no one is free. Woman: Do you have any remorse toward the family of the 17-year-old you ran down with your car? Is Helen not coming? Nope. Thought it would be better to do this just the three of us. Do what? [Beeps] Wally: I sign my name on your card, says you were with me when... when you weren't. Jasper : Yeah, and you're getting paid for it. [Beeps] I think I might throw up now. Duval : Got two questions for you. What are you planning? Who else is involved? I-I don't know what they're planning. I don't... I don't know who they are. This place has a soundproofed room downstairs. Do you want to see it? O-okay, look. A few months ago, that parolee Jasper came to his check-in and said that I'm gonna sign his card even when he doesn't show up. I-I said, "Why would I do that?" He said 'cause they've already deposited money in my account. He says it looks like I'm being paid for something, so I might as well go ahead and go along with it. And if you said no? I did. But then I saw the money was in my account, and I panicked. I tried to go to my supervisor, but I choked because I knew he wouldn't believe me. 'Cause you're a weasel? No. Look, I'm not like you Pritchard boys. Your dad was a badass. He would have told Jasper to just go and shove it. I-I didn't know what else to do. Wally... [Sighs] You got to come with me. You got to take me in? I guess I get that. I just didn't want to lose Helen. You know, it took me 25 years to get back to her. After your dad... when he threw me out, I just... I kept going. I just didn't want to lose her. Wait. What if, instead of taking him in, we use him? Use him? Yeah, yeah. Play him off against Jasper, you know? Uh, maybe you tell your boss that he was working with you the whole time. Holy crap. You want to save him. He's weak, Duval. He's not bad. I-I'm weak. I am, but not bad. I already have a C.I. I'm having a hard enough time explaining. Mary told me that she could trace the money during a transfer, so maybe Wally goes back to Jasper, says he wants more money or he'll turn him in. It'll open the door wide enough to trace the funds. Why is Helen mad at me? It's not my fault she picks lousy guys. Well, it's not like you were her role model or anything. Hey, I paid for your psychology major. I don't need it used against me. You and Helen both. It's like you're trying to ruin this. Ruin what? First stakeout with my son. Car, snacks. I was looking forward to this. Did I really call her an idiot? Oh, make up your mind. Either dig in your heels about being right or feel bad about Helen, but this back-and-forth is giving me whiplash. 
 
 [Motorcycle approaching] What do you want? Why am I here? Uh... Uh... You gonna say something or what? Come on, Wally. I'm starting not to like this. I'm, uh... I'm... He's not gonna make it. I'm turning you in. Yeah, I'm gonna stop this. No, no, no, no. He can do this. Come on. Jasper : You're turning me what?! Wait. Unless... [Groans] unless... unless you give me double what it's been. Look, I need the money. Why do you need more money, Wally? I got a woman in my life. Okay? I want to give her things. Look, if I'm doing this, it's got to be double what it's been or... yeah, I'm turning you in. [Breathing heavily] [Chuckles] You got a girl, huh? All right. I'll get the money. [Chuckles] Well. Yeah. He did it. He did. He hit me in the face. Yeah. But I did it. I wish your dad could have seen it. I got a feeling he did. Go to Mary. Tell her the money's moving. I'll stay on Jasper. All right. Ugh. [Beeps] [Cellphone vibrates] [Beeps] Jasper : Hey. It's me. The parole office wants a raise. Oh, come on. [Horn honks] [Horn honks] [Cellphone rings] [Beeps] Yeah? Where are you? We got to go. Some car has been following me for the last couple miles. I'm taking the long way. You're being tailed? It's probably just a coincidence, but I'm not taking any chances. I'm on Jasper. Where are we with the money? $10,000 was just deposited into Wally Luskin's account. Arthur, you should have some time to trace it back to its source. I calculate eight minutes until the digital trail closes. Tracking now. They're working on it. Come on, Mr. Mellenburg. It's time for you to get zapped. Let's get you to your radiation appointment. So, what are you fighting so hard for to stay alive? If I were you, I'd lay down and give it up. I fight for everything. It's how I made $1 billion. [Chuckles] Well, that money's not doing you any good now, is it? How we doing? Arthur? The security encryption is unknown to me. It seems to have no source. Damn it. I lost him. What? It's what happens when you have one car on a tail. We should have a team... an FBI team. I'm gonna find out where that money's coming from right now. What are you going to do? He can help us, can't he? If he were here today, yes. I swear to god you two are from some other planet. He's right here. Now, you need to wake him up so he can help us find who's at the end of this money trail. And either you do it or I do, and you won't want to watch. You should have gone to the FBI. There's a lot of things that I should have probably done with my life, but that timer says we have 4 minutes left. Aren't real lives out here more important than what's going on in his head today? I made a promise to my brother... To protect him. I get it. I thought I was protecting my daughter, but I was just standing in her way. Arthur. I am sorry, Mary. I cannot find the source of the money. 7-year-old Otto : 'So not gas. It's plasma. It's the fourth state matter they used to think there were only three states, but now they know the sun is actually the fourth state. Adult Mary : Otto, I need you out here. It's time to let go. Otto. Don't go to the end this time. Listen to me. You didn't kill our parents. You can forgive yourself. You didn't kill them. Come out of the car. You can do it. You can forgive yourself. It's not gas. It's plasma. It's the fourth state of matter. Some superclusters form parts of... Otto, that's enough. Which are also parts of... Otto. Shh. I'd like to go just one day without him talking. [Horn honks, tires screeching] There's nothing else I can do. Arthur: One minute left to trace the money. Why does he think he killed your parents? Otto : Because I did. Prison. Jasper is an ex-convict. That made me think of prison. Prison networks are secured differently. You have to know what it is you're looking for to trace the hack. Arthur. Prison. Well, can you tell us who? That'll take a little more time. I've traced it to granite hills correctional facility. Here we go. All right. We trained for this. Been to that mile marker every week. Do it like we drilled and everything goes smooth as smooth... And the money will be in your accounts by the end of the day. According to Otto, there are 98 people... staff and inmates... at the prison who have privileges and access to a computer. He's gonna narrow it down by the time we get there. [Cellphone rings] Yeah? The user is an inmate. Brian Mellenburg. I remember that name. Some hedge-fund jackass got all coked up, killed a woman in a hit-and-run. Brian Mellenburg. Mellenburg is being transferred today for his radiation appointment. And something else. He was that man Jasper's cellmate. I used to have six limos, you know that? One for every day. Biggs : Oh, yeah? What did you do on the seventh day? Chopper Mostly. Sometimes the boat. But... You can't take it with you. You can say that again. What the hell's going on? I believe... My ride is here. [Gunfire] Whoa! Whoa! You think if Helen knew who I was, she'd forgive me for what I said? I don't remember calling her that. I mean, what kind of father calls his kid an idiot? Did I ever call you that? Yeah. But I knew it meant you loved me. Really? No. Just need a little more time to prepare myself for the softer side of you. That's a damn prison van. Stay right there. Do not move. FBI. I'm FBI. Do not come closer! You were transporting Brian Mellenburg, weren't you? They took him. Who? Who took him? Fake cops. Fake cop car. So you see why I don't trust you. Just stay right there! Why is that wheelchair empty? Because he got up and walked away. Jasper's rap sheet said robbery. I thought it was a heist. You know put is Wall-Street guy in my cell five years ago. I never seen anyone so scared. But I never seen anyone so smart. That first day, after I beat the crap out of him, he says to me, his mouth all full of blood, "You know violence." [Gunshots] "You know violence," he said. "I think we can work together." And now you're rich. And now you're free. One's for the car. One's for the cabin. Don't spend a dime for two years. Don't change your habits, either. We're going to replay an interview Brian Mellenburg did one day before his spectacular prison break. Mellenburg : As you know, I received the maximum sentence... 25 to life... and with my diagnosis, I'll die here. I was angry at the judge who handed down my sentence. Now, uh... I see he was right. Man, I screwed that up royally. My son's pissed off, my daughter's got a broken heart, and that guy on TV's just laughing at me. Interviewer: Right in what way? People need to pay for... for what they've done. My time in prison has taught me to be strong, to be able to face the truth. Without justice... No one is free. [Beeps] Everyone here looks so angry at me, like I'm some public enemy. I served my time. Duval : But you're on parole, which I'm about to violate and send you back. On what grounds? I'll find something. Or you can tell us where Mellenburg is. How should I know? You have four years left on your sentence, Jasper, if I violate you. You're Willing to do that for your old cellmate? [Cellphone rings] Jimmy : Duval, you got Jasper down there? Yes. At the FBI, where sworn law-enforcement officers work. Listen, Mellenburg... he's after the judge who sentenced him. I saw an interview. These... these wall street guys... they play for keeps. He didn't break out just to lay down to die. He wants justice. He wants revenge. The judge. That's a good theory. Thanks. Listen, you got to do whatever you got to do to protect that judge. You got to go hard on Jasper. You got to find out what mellenburg's plan is. You got to go real hard on Jasper, Duval. Like I said, we looked into it. The judge went down in a boat accident eight months ago. Got to go. [Beeps] [Sighs] "What is my freedom?" By Brian Mellenburg. Most guys lay there in jail, they think about the cigar, the wine, the good meal, and the women. But not me. That's not my freedom. I'd lay there and I'd think about doing all that, knowing that you, judge... knowing that you were right there in a cage. That is my freedom. I got eight months of food here. That's about how much time I got left to live, and I'll give you enough to stay alive so that I can watch you... Every day. And when I get to my end, I'm gonna open your cage. Keep the chains on you, of course, but open your cage so when I die and the animals come for me, they'll come for you, too. Yeah, I've had a lot of time to think. You think mellenburg is paying him to keep his mouth shut? [Elevator dings] Can I help you with something? I'm a parole officer. I was alerted that my parolee Jasper Willitz is here for questioning. That's right. In relation to the Brian Mellenburg escape? Is there something you need to tell us about your parolee? Yes. Uh, my parolee Jasper Willitz was with me during the time of that prison break. What? It was a field visit. I signed his card. He was with me the whole time. It's my obligation to tell his attorney that. I'll bring him out. Not so fast, Wally. My father put you up to this? Your father? My brother. My brother. What's going on here, Wally? I'm a parole officer doing my job. Pritchard, can I speak with you? Jasper : What? You want more money for coming down there to alibi me out? No. I want to know where Mellenburg is, and you're gonna tell me. Oh, look at the little tough man. [Chuckles] What, you grow a pair, huh? No. Brought a pair with him. Uh-oh. I'm not Wally that you can use as a punching bag, am I? [Groans] [Crunches] Aah! Aaah! Aah! [Groaning] I can see it worming its way through your head now. "This guy... he's a lot stronger than I am, isn't he?" Ask him again, Wally. Wally : Where's Mellenburg? Screw you! The both of you! [Grunts] What do you say we give him the full sheriff, huh? Wait. What's that? See, the full sheriff is when he counts to three and then you start crying. One, two... Aah! You're breaking my hands! Aah! [Cellphone rings] You have him, don't you? [Groans] Well, he wasn't gonna talk to you, was he? And he talked to you? No, actually. He talked to Wally. Hey, Wally. You tell Agent Pritchard what you found out. Hi. You might want to get a pen. Okay, you take highway 30. Get off at the old road. And then, apparently... [Opera music plays] [Man singing operatically] [Rumbling] [Helicopter approaches] [Door bangs open] FBI, freeze! Freeze! Drop the knife! Drop it! On the ground! [Music and singing continue] Get him out of there. Sorry, Mr. Mellenburg. We barged in before you could finish it. How did you find me? Wasn't me. It was an old man and a weasel who tracked you down. But I'm the one that gets to put you back in your cage. Get him out of here. What do you want? He should never have called you an idiot, your dad. Thanks. I'm sure he said some messed up stuff to you, too. No, I-I don't think he understood you, Helen. You just try to see the best in people, and I think he saw it as a weakness. I saw the best in my dad, even if he didn't see it in himself. You know he loved you, don't you? Even at the end, you were always his little girl. [Voice breaking] You're gonna make me cry. There's a reason you still feel like he's around. It... Oh. Well, it's a damn ambush. Helen, I can't explain. I don't have a lot of time, but you need to come with us. Trust me. I'll get... I'll get my keys. What was going on here? Emotional honesty, Duval. [Indistinct conversations] Oh. It's another damn ambush. I'm sorry I lied. I can't take it back. And I know I have no right to ask this, but, um... I have to go away for... A little while. But I was hoping that when I get back, we could... we could start again. Going away? [Sighs] For how long? 8 to 12 months. It's a good deal. For his cooperation leading to the arrests. Helen, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. I just want to know... What you said to me then... is it still true? Will you leave, too? No. I will always be here with you, Otto. Nothing can ever change that. Okay. It's, uh, time to go now, Wally. To jail. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go to jail now. Hey, Wally, listen, um... It's not gonna be easy. You know that, right? But you can do this. You can be tough. I've seen you do it. If you ever doubt yourself, just know that the Pritchard boys... we don't. [Smooches] Oh. [Chuckles] You were so young and handsome. And you... you were the most beautiful bride that ever said "I do," huh? Connor saved me, and he's gonna save you, too.
