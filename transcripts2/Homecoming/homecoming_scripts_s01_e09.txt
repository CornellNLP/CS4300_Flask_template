  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  - Heidi Bergman? 
  - Yes. 
  - Hi. 
  Colin Belfast. 
  - Hi. 
  - Ready for the interview? 
  - Uh, of course. 
  Come with me. 
  Amazing building, isn't it? 
  Uh, yes, beautiful. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  So, what happens next? 
  I'll file my report. 
  The complaint will be elevated. 
  There'll be an investigation. 
  They'll establish what happened, decide who's responsible. 
  What about me? 
  What do you mean? 
  I I was there, I was I don't know. 
  Someone like you, that that's that's not what they're after. 
  Like me? 
  At at your level. 
  An employee. 
  But I deserve to be punished, don't I? 
  For what I did. 
  I don't know. 
  (CAR DOOR CLOSES) 
  (RUSTLING) 
  - Morning. 
  - Morning. 
  (BOX DROPS IN TRASH) 
  (ELLEN GRUNTS) 
  Mom, I really don't want to talk right now. 
  Well, I do. 
  Well, then, we disagree. 
  I, uh I hope you know there's nothing you could tell me - that would make - People trusted me, Mom. 
  I lied to them. 
  All right. 
  It's not all right. 
  Well, what if it's not? 
  So what, then? 
  You don't understand. 
  What don't I understand? 
  That what you were doing down there was fishy? 
  I knew that the first time you told me about it. 
  Well, you'd just gotten your degree. 
  You had, what, three years experience? 
  And they wanted you to run that whole thing, a company like that? 
  Pay you that salary? 
  (SCOFFS) 
  Fishy. 
  I'm sorry, Mom, but you don't know what you're talking about. 
  People make compromises. 
  You did what you had to do. 
  You took a job. 
  My job was to help them. 
  Maybe it wasn't. 
  You know, they kept you busy down there, but whenever we did talk, you know how you sounded? 
  Happy. 
  Just just brimming. 
  I was just telling you what you wanted to hear. 
  What am I supposed to do now? 
  Go to work. 
  (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
  - (DOOR OPENS) 
  - WALTER: Heidi? 
  Hi. 
  - Come in. 
  - (DOOR CLOSES) 
  This is Walter Cruz. 
  May 15, 2018. 
  Week six. 
  What happened to the fish? 
  Uh, I got rid of them. 
  Just figured it was for the best. 
  I couldn't get into it. 
  I saw there's some new guys here. 
  Cafeteria's jammed. 
  Yes, we're expanding. 
  Well, something must be working. 
  Right? 
  Congratulations. 
  Thank you. 
  Um, they told me about my deployment. 
  So that's been interesting. 
  How do you feel about that? 
  Good. 
  Yeah, no, um I'm excited, actually. 
  I think Shrier might be able to come. 
  - No, Walter. 
  - Well, I know he's with his family, but it's possible. 
  Shrier needs more time. 
  Well, sure, but it's possible. 
  He could get fixed up, just like you did with me, and then he'd be able to go back. 
  That's possible. 
  You're right. 
  It is. 
  Or even Lesky. 
  Whoever it is, once you get to know people, they start to become like family. 
  Or they don't, and you pretend. 
  But, um Look, the point is this will all go by really quickly. 
  I mean, that last deployment felt like it was just one long day, so this will pretty much be the same. 
  You'll see. 
  And you aren't worried about going back? 
  No. 
  Um, and and this is what you you want for yourself? 
  I want to be done. 
  And this is how we get it done, so If I don't go, they'll just find some kid who has no idea what he's getting himself into, so it's better this way. 
  I'm not scared, if that's what you meant. 
  I know what it's gonna be. 
  It's just that you'd talked about how Yeah, Heidi, I know, but Do you want to come to work every day? 
  No. 
  Right. 
  You sometimes feel like, "f*ck this job. 
  " But you come anyway, right? 
  You know it's nothing you can't handle. 
  It's pretty much the same thing. 
  Besides, redeployment will be what, nine months? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I'll be free. 
  Might come back and visit you. 
  If you wanted. 
  That would be nice. 
  You don't have to humor me. 
  No, I'm not. 
  I just may not be here, is all. 
  Well, where are you going? 
  I don't know. 
  It isn't always up to me. 
  Okay. 
  Well, wherever you end up, I'll just have to track you down. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  You might be a totally different person by then. 
  No way. 
  I'm not changing. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Anyway, um I really appreciate what you did for me, Heidi. 
  Thank you. 
  You're welcome. 
  I don't think I'd be able to go back if it wasn't for you, so Did I s say something or ? 
  Walter, if (BEEP) 
  Hey, I, uh I haven't eaten. 
  Would you like to go with me to the cafeteria? 
  Oh. 
  Uh Well, I I already ate, but sure. 
  I didn't think that was allowed. 
  Well (CHUCKLES) 
  I mean, it is your last day. 
  What are they gonna do? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yeah. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Okay. 
  - Yeah? 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  Let's go. 
  (CHILDREN CHATTERING IN DISTANCE) 
  (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV) 
  LYDIA: Yeah. 
  Uh-huh. 
  I understand. 
  I understand. 
  And what is the drop-dead latest that we can let you know about that? 
  Let me call you back. 
  MAN (ON TV): All right, Jordan, Trish, this is our fourth property today. 
  LYDIA: Look at you. 
  So, what did he say? 
  Who? 
  The DoD guy. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  The DoD guy. 
  He's gonna file it. 
  I should've just stayed here. 
  I f*cking panicked. 
  (COLIN SIGHS) 
  I just made everything worse. 
  And how do I explain that - You don't have to explain. 
  - No, I do. 
  I do, Lydia. 
  That's what I'm trying to say, okay? 
  There's gonna be consequences to Could lose Are you talking to Ron? 
  Yeah, this afternoon. 
  His office. 
  - Then we're gonna be fine. 
  - I Ron doesn't even like me. 
  I don't I don't fit in with his whole thing. 
  Ron doesn't need a friend. 
  What does he call you? 
  What, a killer? 
  A killer. 
  That is what Ron needs. 
  But what I did, it Doesn't matter what you did. 
  Baby, you don't understand. 
  No, I do. 
  (SIGHS) 
  You boys take care of each other. 
  I have to tell you something. 
  Okay. 
  Um (COLIN INHALES DEEPLY) 
  Should we put it in the box? 
  No, no, I I want to say this. 
  - No. 
  I don't want - (DRAWER OPENS, SHUFFLING) 
  I did something. 
  Something happened. 
  And telling me about it isn't gonna change that. 
  So what do we do? 
  We put it in the box, and we move forward. 
  (WRITING) 
  (TEARS PAPER) 
  Good. 
  (DRAWER SHUTS) 
  There. 
  It's gone. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I'm gonna miss that guy. 
  ENGEL: See this water fountain right here? 
  This is my water fountain. 
  Nobody uses it but me. 
  But if you do use it, don't wipe your boogers on it. 
  Why would I wipe my boogers on it? 
  Hey, Walt. 
  You know the thing about you? 
  What? 
  You're always halfway somewhere else. 
  - Am I? 
  - Yeah. 
  What's it sound like in there? 
  Where, in my head? 
  Yeah, is there, like, really loud music? 
  Some days. 
  Yeah. 
  Well (SIGHS) 
  looks like we missed it. 
  Um, just give me a minute. 
  Take a seat.

  (CHATTER STOPS) 
  (MURMURING) 
  (DOOR SHUTS)

  What can I say? 
  I don't like to eat alone. 
  DARA: Okay, can we talk about this later, please? 
  AJ: Yeah, sure, but I have to know by tomorrow morning. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  - So - Hi. 
  Can I take that? 
  Hey, Heidi. 
  What are you feelings about aged meat? 
  Oh, it's What? 
  - Why are you asking her that? 
  - Because, I'm saying, people hear the words "aged" and then "meat," they get all spun out about it. 
  Did that table just get here? 
  - Yeah. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  - MAN: Sit down. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Okay, I need to start over now. 
  MAN: Now you gotta clean it up. 
  AJ: If you were listening to what I'm saying Hi. 
  Welcome. 
  Did you guys have a chance - to look at the menu? 
  - DAD: Hi. 
  - Milk, milk, milk. 
  - Uh, can you just bring us a ton of bread as quickly as possible? 
  - Thanks. 
  And maybe some crayons. 
  - That's a good idea. 
  - Thank you. 
  - AJ: all about labeling. 
  Just like wine. 
  And that's exactly my point. 
  - WOMAN: Ma'am, excuse me. 
  - DARA: What is? 
  - WOMAN: Ma'am. 
  - AJ: What is the difference between wine and meat for a consumer? 
  - MAN: Miss! 
  - AJ: Freshness, right? 
  - People want fresh meat and aged wine. 
  - MAN: Miss! 
  Can I get - some more coffee? 
  - AJ: So why are they different? 
  It's all about the packaging. 
  - This is basic persuasion 101. 
  - DARA: Meat wine? 
  AJ: No! 
  What I'm saying is if - Thank you so much. 
  - MOM: Thank you. 
  How's everything? 
  - MAN: Fine. 
  Thanks. 
  - MAN 2: Excuse me, ma'am. 
  - MAN: Thank you. 
  - You're welcome. 
  Miss? 
  My food? 
  I've been waiting. 
  - Oh. 
  Let me check on it. 
  - AJ: you cut it down. 
  I just don't understand how you have something that's fresh, and you have something that's not fresh, - and then - MAN: We're still waiting on that ice tea, ma'am. 
  - and then it's a good idea. 
  - 'Cause you're making it sound stupid. 
  - DARA: What? 
  Maybe it is. 
  Yeah. 
  - AJ: Okay. 
  Dara, your section. 
  - COOK: Dara. 
  - DARA: Sorry. 
  AJ: What is your problem? 
  - Why can't we just powwow about it? 
  - MAN 3: Ma'am. 
  - If you'd just agree - Then leave. 
  - Oh, my f*cking God! 
  - (GASPING) 
 
 
 
  Look what you did!

  Yeah. 
  Sure. 
  This is pretty good, actually. 
  Yeah, the food here's not bad. 
  You've never eaten here before? 
  We're not allowed. 
  That doesn't seem fair. 
  You're right. 
  It's not. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  I was thinking about that road trip. 
  - Oh, yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  What about it? 
  Just how that would be, how I'd never done that. 
  Well, maybe that's a problem we need to fix. 
  I think you're right. 
  Let's do that. 
  When I get back. 
  What was the name of that town again? 
  Um Fish ? 
  - Fish Camp.

  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
  PEOPLE: Good afternoon.

  Belfast fled the interview. 
  I drove Bergman home. 
  And she confirmed this scheme? 
  Well, as much as she could. 
  She was she was upset. 
  And so you'll you'll be elevating this to the inspector general?

  (LOUD WHOOSH) 
  (SIGHING) 
  Well, this looks fine. 
  Okay. 
  You know, we've we've seen a lot of people, lot of options, uh, some very experienced candidates, but, uh What is experience, Heidi? 
  What is it? 
  Yeah. 
  I mean, it's really just familiarity, right? 
  Familiarity with the past, with how things are, but what about the future? 
  What about the way things could be? 
  Um I I think I I see what you mean. 
  What we need is passion, focus, relentless commitment to something that might not be clear in the moment because it doesn't yet exist. 
  You'd be amazed how hard it is to find people like that. 
  You're you're asking, do I, um do I have those qualities? 
  Yes, I am. 
  Um well, I know that my experience is somewhat limited and my my training doesn't directly apply, but I am certainly, um, eager to you know, play a play a role in, um in making in in being part of, um uh, this. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Well, that's great. 
  Listen, thank you so much for coming all the way down here.

  You're looking for someone who won't hold back, who is willing to build their life around this work? 
  That is me. 
  That is what I want. 
  I I am ready to just put my whole heart into this and, uh, just give it everything I've got, from beginning to end. 
  Absolutely. 
  Um (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
