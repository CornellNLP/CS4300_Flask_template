  I warned him about her. 
  You know, I told him about the trees. 
  But Walter, he never Warned him about what? 
  They were hiding there. 
  And I I couldn't couldn't explain it right. 
  She knew everything anyway, so What did she know? 
  - Who was hiding ? 
  - Shh.

  - What what did Heidi Bergman know, - Mr. Shrier? 
  - Remember, okay?

  Shrier, just what did she know? 
  What did she ? 
  Hey, everything okay here, Joe? 
  Anybody? 
  Guys, come on. 
  We have to practice. 
  Look, going home, you're gonna see some old friends. 
  They may not get everything that you've been through. 
  All right? 
  They may even say some stuff that makes you uncomfortable we're just gonna role-play that. 
  That's all this is, just some role-play. 
  Anyone? 
  Guys, it's just a drink with an old friend. 
  That's all this has to be. 
  That's it. 
  Engel, you're week one. 
  Why don't you just try it? 
  Give it a whirl, see what happens. 
  I can't imagine that, man. 
  What part?

  Okay, great, okay. 
  Welcome home, bro! 
  Oh, it is so good to see you. 
  You, too, friend. 
  Yeah. 
  Gosh, you know, while you were gone, I met a lot of great people. 
  - I'm happy to hear it. 
  - Yeah, this one guy, I mean I guess I'd call him my best friend. 
  And I can't really stay long, because we have tickets to a local sporting event. 
  Oh, well, that sounds great. 
  Yeah. 
  Oh. 
  Do you want to come? 
  - Sure. 
  - Oh. 
  Shoot, we didn't get you a ticket.

  Yeah, man. 
  - Heidi - So, what are you gonna do now that you're back, hmm? 
  I don't know. 
  I was thinking maybe take a couple weeks, relax. 
  So, when you get tired of that? 
  I was thinking of driving out west. 
  Well, that sounds like a good idea fresh start.

  It took me a long time to make my way here. 
  And what is it that you did before? 
  Before. 
  Um, let's see. 
  I was a receptionist. 
  I got promoted to HR. 
  Laid off. 
  So I moved back home with my mom. 
  You know, tried selling real estate for a while. 
  I met a guy who was married, um, and I thought, if I left everything behind and moved two states over, it would definitely work out with him. 
  It did not. 
  I moved back home. 
  Um office manager. 
  Quit. 
  Warehouse manager. 
  Quit.

  I say - Can you close the door, please? 
  - It's my room. 
  - What's even the point of this? 
  - It'll be funny, I swear. 
  Okay? 
  - You know, what'd be funnier is if we, uh - Look, it won't work. 
  - You can't get close enough. 
  - No, that's what I'm saying. 
  - We use a sheet - Uh-uh. 
  We get a bike tire.

  How much? 
  About a hundred K.

  No, I'm saying you gonna get a job. 
  Right? 
  You'll buy a house. 
  - So? 
  - So you'll be a taxpaying civilian. 
  All right, but if they can fix us, right? 
  Then why didn't they just ?

  Listen, I'm gonna spend a couple more days down here, tie things off. 
  Okay. 
  You mean in Milwaukee? 
  So I follow her, and she takes the harmonica to Cruz's room, and they were in there for quite a while, alone, just the two of them. 
  - What are you doing? 
  - Shh. 
  Anyway, I thought I should let you know. 
  Uh, again, this is Craig from the facility.

  - It's, um 6:40. 
  - The f*ck are these rocks? 
  - People like it.

  - You can reach me on my cell The world doesn't just stop because f*cking Ron decides - Colin, he's your boss. 
  - that he wants to hang in the middle of the work week. 
  That man is so - Hi! 
  - Hi! 
  - Come on in. 
  - Great! 
  Thank you. 
  - This is stunning. 
  - Gorgeous. 
  - Really. 
  Hi! 
  Nice to see you! 
  - Hi! 
  This place - is incredible. 
  - Mm. 
  I love how, um just simple it is. 
  We tried the whole big house thing the lawn, the pool. 
  - It just wasn't for us. 
  - Yeah. 
  Um, I I know what you mean. 
  Kate, do we have sage in the garden? 
  Yes, Chef. 
  I think we're supposed to leave now. 
  Well, I would love to see the garden anyway. 
  Right this way. 
  So how's it going with the Homecoming thing? 
  You guys are over at Mirror Pond, right? 
  Yeah. 
  Right. 
  Good. 
  You know, we're, uh We're just squatting at the complex for now - until Geist builds that - The Wellness Center. 
  - Right. 
  - Right. 
  So, you know, by then, we should be in a proper facility. 
  Making due. 
  Mm. 
  We really appreciate you guys inviting us, Ron. 
  Um you know, the truth is I've been so buried, I haven't really had a chance But you must be feeling good about it. 
  I mean, if you're gonna take your hand off it for the day. 
  Well, to be honest I'm not feeling good, Ron. 
  You're not? 
  No, I'm feeling great. 
  Oh. 
  That that's what I love about you, man. 
  You're a throwback. 
  You're a killer. 
  You bring this thing home for me, I could see you moving up to Redwood. 
  And then maybe we get you out to the farm. 
  Meet Mr. 
  Geist. 
  - He's hilarious. 
  - Hmm. 
  Yeah, the table's set, my friend. 
  Thank you, Ron. 
  Don't thank me. 
  Just get it done. 
  I'm gonna step outside for a second just to check in with the sitter. 
  - Go for it. 
  - Okay. 
  Mm. 
  Hey, Colin. 
  What's up? 
  Heidi. 
  I appreciate you picking up. 
  Oh. 
  Well, sure. 
  S sorry. 
  Did I miss one of your calls, or ? 
  Heidi, what are we doing here? 
  Uh, you mean here at Homecoming? 
  Yes, Heidi. 
  At Homecoming. 
  What's our mission? 
  Well, we are treating PTSD like a cancer, something to be eradicated, not just managed. 
  And? 
  Well, and To those To those ends, we are using medication to delete the harmful responses to the traumatic memories. 
  Good, and and - you're on board with that? 
  - Yes. 
  Of course. 
  I'm sorry, Colin. 
  Did we get some negative feedback or something? 
  Whoa. 
  Do we need negative feedback, Heidi, to remember to stay on our game, to know that our asses - are on the line? 
  - No, of course not. 
  I'm just wondering if there's something specific that you're referring to. 
  Yeah, there is. 
  There is. 
  Oh. 
  Does this have to do with the chair thing yesterday? 
  The chair. 
  No, Heidi Heidi, I'm talking about your little encounter with Walter Cruz, alone in his bedroom. 
  How do you know about that? 
  I know all sorts of things, Heidi. 
  It's my facility. 
  What the f*ck were you doing, Heidi? 
  Uh, Colin, it was a private conversation. 
  Because I'll tell ya, if it was anybody else, uh No, it was a situation where it'd be pretty clear what you were doing, what you were, you know, up to. 
  And I I realize, how taken out of context, this might seem inappropriate. 
  No, it's completely inappropriate. 
  I mean, there's no question of that. 
  No, and I'm sorry if I might have stepped over a line. 
  No, that's not what I'm talking about, Heidi! 
  I'm talking about what you did. 
  What did I do? 
  What you gave to him. 
  - Oh, the harmonica? 
  - Yes, Heidi. 
  - The harmonica. 
  - Oh. 
  I I'm not following you. 
  Okay, it didn't occur to you the kind of effect that an object like this could have? 
  Like something directly tied to the emotions that we're trying to delete? 
  Okay, Heidi, what do we know about triggering flashbacks? 
  Huh? 
  How does that work? 
  It's a, um, confluence of rele Right. 
  A confluence of relevant stimuli, like sounds, smells, touch. 
  - I know. 
  - Oh, you know? 
  Oh, and and yet, you still handed him a big f*cking chunk of that, huh? 
  With no idea, uh, what it could potentially combine with, what it could trigger? 
  I mean, do you not see what an enormous f*cking liability - that creates? 
  - No, I do, I do, but I Oh, wonderful. 
  So then, what I want to know then is, if you did it on purpose. 
  If you deliberately tried to undermine what we're trying to do here, or if you're just so naive and and dimwitted No. 
  - I was just thinking. 
  I was - Oh, wait. 
  - So you admit that it was deliberate? 
  - No. 
  I I just think, with with Walter, we might be able to preserve certain Okay, h hold on, hold on. 
  Wait. 
  So, wait. 
  You're advocating that we take our experimental trials, our our clean data sets, and and we do what with them, Heidi? 
  - No. 
  No. 
  Uh - What? 
  We, uh - We take a sh1t all over them? 
  - I know No. 
  Is that, is that what you're saying, Heidi? 
  - Just to sh1t all over them? 
  - No, I'm not - Oh, yes, you are. 
  Obviously, you are. 
  - No, I'm not saying that. 
  I mean, if I were trying to, you know, to just completely compromise our results, just just totally f*ck them up, this is what I would do. 
  Uh, I I, um I just feared we were losing Cruz entirely, so I made a judgment that Oh. 
  Oh, so this wasn't an erratic, emotional outburst on your part? 
  You were doing your job, you were you were trying to help? 
  Yes. 
  Okay, well, listen to me then, Heidi. 
  Stop helping. 
  Do what I'm telling you to do. 
  Review the memory, observe the effects, record the data. 
  Understood? 
  Yes. 
  If something like this happens again, trust me, I will find out about it, and you will be out on your ass. 
  And then what will happen to your little boyfriend? 
  So put your emotions aside and do your f*cking job, understood? 
  - Heidi? 
  - Yes. 
  Understood. 
  Oh.
