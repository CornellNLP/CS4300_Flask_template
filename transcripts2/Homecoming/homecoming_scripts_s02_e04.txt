 Okay. 
 So we've outlined how you identified soldier who met your desired profile. 
 I'd like to go back to the ingestion. 
 All right. 
 Your corporation was aware of the possibility of overdose. 
 Overdose is always a possibility. 
 But the men were not informed they were being medicated. 
 They did sign waivers, accepting full responsibility... 
 No. We lied. 
 The protocol was unacceptable. 
 What happened to them after this, uh... 
 Bergman incident? 
 - The men? 
- Yeah. 
 They completed the cycle. 
 Cutting them off midstream was too dangerous. 
 And... and then? 
 Most of them returned to active duty without further symptoms. 
 Wait. 
 Are you claiming now that the program worked? 
 No, the program as Colin...as Mr. Belfast conceived it, was unethical. 
 - It was wrong. 
- And after that...

 Yeah. 
 It went well. 
 They appreciated that we came to them. 
 I think we might be okay. 
 Well, all right. 
 Good job. 
 Now, this... it's a nine-grain mush. 
 Mmm. 
 There you go. 
 - Thank you. 
- Hey. 
 It's not good or anything, but you won't be hungry again for days. 
 I was hoping to show you, um... 
 There's some ideas that I've been working on. 
 We're thinking too small with the roller. 
 We're missing opportunities. 
 Uh, yeah, well, as far as... 
 Sir, if you'll just look, we're keeping ourselves in a box, an echo chamber. 
 The roller has potential far beyond our traditional audience of... 
 Right. I get it. 
 I've been using it myself. 
It's more than stress relief. 
 I can do things now that I couldn't before. 
 - Audrey. 
- Yes. 
 It's great work. 
Very creative. 
 But... 
 We're not doing the roller anymore. 
 W-what... what do you mean? 
 We're not doing it. 
 At all? 
 Right. 
 If this is because of what Colin did, 
 - I can promise you that... 
- No, couple of rotten guys. 
 - Just get 'em out? 
- Yes, exactly. 
 No, that's not gonna do it. 
 That's like, uh... what's that movie with the... the blue guy? 
 He's got that... 
That golden lantern, lamp, or whatever? 
 Um, Aladdin. 
 No, no, sorry. 
No, it wasn't a lamp. 
 It was a ring. 
It was golden. 
 Little blue guy. 
 Oh Lord of the Rings. 
 Right, that one. 
 So the little guy, he's... he's got his ring, and it makes him feel good. 
 He loves it. 
 But it changes him, right? 
 His eyes get really weird, and his skin turns, and it's a bad scene. 
 Every minute of every day, everything he does, it's just for that ring. 
 And he doesn't even realize it. 
He thinks he's happy. 
 I'm sorry. 
I don't... 
 I thought we could make people's lives just a little easier, and then... 
 I've been out there every day. 
 It's all I've been thinking about for years.

 Hi. 
 Name and ID. 
 Walter Cruz, 010168. 
 I'm looking for my medical records. 
 There was an explosion, an IED, and I thought I had surgery, so I just... 
 Okay, one moment. 
 I'm not seeing that. 
 - What? 
- Surgery. 
 What do you mean? 
 I was blown up, 
 so they had to have treated me, right? 
 Oh, treatment. 
 One moment. 
 I'm just saying, something did happen to me, so... 
 One moment. 
 Treatment. 
Yes, I have that. 
 Great. 
 Administered by Geist Emergent Group. 
 That's a private contractor. 
 So they did the surgery? 
 I'm not seeing that. 
 Okay, but they treated me, right? 
 Yes. 
 What kind of treatment? 
 They're a private contractor. I don't think I can... 
 Sir, please step back. 
 Well, you just told me Geist did the treatment. 
 I just want to know what kind of treatment. 
 Right, but we didn't treat you there. 
 That's a private contractor. 
 What the f*ck does that mean, private? 
 It wasn't us. 
Outsourced. 
 - Contract... 
- But you have the information 
 on your screen, okay? 
 Why can't I just see it? 
 I'm sorry. 
 What the f*ck are you smiling about? 
 I'm not. 
 Look, all I'm asking... 
 It was hard for me to come down here, okay? 
 There's no one I can... 
 It's hard for me to talk about this. 
 You can understand that, right? 
 I can submit a request to the contractor. 
 Great. Yeah, great. 
Let's do that. 
 - Submitted. 
- Okay. 
 What do I do know? 
 You wait. 
 What, like, get another number? 
 Um, no. 
 They'll get back to us in eight to 12 weeks. 
 Eight to 12 weeks? 
 Well, officially. Sometimes it's longer. 
 Longer than 12 weeks? 
 Just to tell me what you already know. 
 I'm losing my f*cking mind here! 
 Sir, I need you to calm down. 
 Why can't you tell me what's on that screen? 
 Because it's private. 
 Private. 
 Sure. 
 Sir! 
 Wow, well, thank you so much for taking the time. 
 This is quite a spread you've got here. 
 - That's all jojoba. 
- Uh-huh. 
 That's a great crop. 
Lot of... lot of uses. 
 Oh, that's fascinating. 
 - Mm. Eh, people call it a goat nut. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Because it's supposed to look like goat testicles. 
 - Hmm. 
- I checked. It's true. 
 Oh, well, of course you did. 
 Huh? 
 Oh... 
 Oh, uh, excuse me, is that, uh... 
 Can we stop here? 
 - Can we... can we stop here? 
- Down here, sure. 
 - Yeah. 
- Thank you. 
 Oh, wow. 
 So these are all the berries. 
 Yeah, for now. 
 Soon, this will all be ground cover. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, once we get the berries out, we got to give the soil a chance to breathe. 
 What... what do you mean, get them out? 
 We don't need them anymore. 
 Came to our senses, thanks to her. 
 Huh. 
 Well, I hate to be a difficult guest, but I can't let you do that. 
 What does that mean... let me? 
 Well, this is awkward. 
I thought I had good news. 
 We want to partner with you. 
 Who? The... 
- Pentagon. 
 Yeah, we want as much of this as possible as fast as possible. 
 I don't understand. 
You're saying... 
 Well, you were very clear in your presentation. 
 The problem was the protocol, the implementation. 
 The substance itself was... 
 Well, yes, but... 
 The men that finished the program, it helped them... Isn't that what you said? 
 - No, I just... 
- No, the whole f*cking thing... 
 What we did, no good can come of that. 
 Well, I just totally disagree. 
 I think you were way out over your skis. 
 Mistakes were made. 
 My people, we do this work every day. 
 All you're asking for is just the extract. 
 That's what you'd need. 
 - Yes. 
- Audrey. 
 Now, we can't help you. 
 You'd be compensated. 
 Like, out the ass. 
 You're not listening to me. 
 Well, I think you're not listening to me. 
 Do you have a time machine? 
 - A what? 
- Any of these plants... 
 If you eat them, will they send you back in time? 
 - No. 
- Well, then the toothpaste is out of the tube, Leonard. 
 You can't go back and un-plant this plant.

 We need it, which means it's ours. 
 What about you? 
 You know all about this, the plant, the juice. 
 Well, yes, but... 
 All we need is someone to help make it happen, 
 someone with ideas and solutions, with some f*cking competence.

 "All I need is someone who knows how to grow it, pick it, and ship it." 
 That's you. 
You've done all that. 
 I was Colin's assistant. 
I wasn't... 
 Colin spent half of his life in the Delta One Sky Lounge trying to get a f*cking upgrade. 
 - I know. 
- Meanwhile, you were the one overseeing production, start to finish, right? 
 Yeah. 
 You said you wanted to matter there. 
 I do. 
 Leonard is not gonna listen to you. 
 He's too much like Colin. 
 - Bunda... 
- Boo-nda. 
 Okay, well, whatever her name is, 
 she believes in you. 
 She sees something in you. 
 
 
 
 But what if she's wrong? 
 You inherited a mess, Temple. 
 And you're gonna get things back on track. 
 You're gonna take a f*cking criminal investigation, 
 and turn it into a gigantic new contract, 
 a whole new business model. 
 So have a sip of that wine 
 and think about that for a second. 
 Hmm... 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Of course, I'm right.

 I'll tell you one thing... 
I'm gonna take Colin's office. 
 Do it. 
You are so legit right now. 
 This is your moment. 
 Right. 
 Okay, what? 
 Things aren't done. 
They're still... 
 Of course. 
I was just saying 
 if this works out... when this works out... 
 - Mm-hmm. 
- We had talked about... 
 - The baby idea.

 I went to go look at donors today. 
 And I found some really cool Vietnamese guys, 
 some great options. 
 So she can be just like us. 
 Sorry, who is she?

 - Don't worry. 
- What about your job? 
 I'll work up until I can't anymore, 
 and I'll take off a few weeks. 
 Weeks? 
That's nothing. 
 Okay, months. 
Three months, six months. 
 I'll do whatever it takes. 
 I know you don't believe things are gonna work out, 
 - but I promise you... 
- You can't. 
 Temple, every day I go into work, 
 I deal with the shittiest of people, 
 the lowest of low behavior.
