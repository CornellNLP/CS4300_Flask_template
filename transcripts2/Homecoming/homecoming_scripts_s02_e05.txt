   Bro, you like comic books? 
   Uh, not really, no. 
   You got any Adderall? 
   Cruz, Walter! 
  Got a visitor. 
   Who is it? 
   Some lady. 
   Lady. 
  Is it my mom? 
   Wouldn't be my first guess. 
   ♪ ♪  - Are those necessary? 
  - Regulation. 
   So it says here that you assaulted a computer? 
   I'm sorry. 
  Who are you? 
   I'm Jackie. 
   Hi, Walter. 
  I am with Vets4Vets. 
   What is this, the VA? 
   No, we're independent, all volunteer-based,  but they did notify us about your situation. 
   Look, I apologize, okay? 
   I lost my temper, got out of control. 
   Hey, you don't need to apologize to me. 
   I don't care what you did. 
  I'm just here to get you out. 
   - Out? 
  - Yeah, that's we do. 
   Bail relief, short-term housing, stuff like that. 
   Vets4Vets. 
   Let's talk. 
   Come on, let's have a seat. 
  Let's talk. 
   What's the catch? 
   I bail you out, you agree to an evaluation. 
   Answer a few questions. 
   And then I see if we offer any services  that we can refer you to so this does not happen again. 
   Yeah, this definitely will not happen again, I promise you. 
   Hey, you are not the first guy to go into an office  and forget his manners. 
   I have done way worse. 
   - What kind of evaluation? 
  - A conversation. 
   Easy stuff. 
  We could do it over a beer. 
   Look, whatever you decide,  can I say one thing? 
   Sure. 
   ♪ ♪  When I got back, I knew something was wrong with me,  but I couldn't explain it to anyone. 
   It was like the people around me were keeping a secret. 
   Like we were in a movie,  and everyone knew we were in a movie except for me. 
   But what I learned  is that this happens to almost all of us. 
   Those fucked-up thoughts that you're thinking right now,  that you are feeling, you are not alone,  and you are not crazy. 
   You're just having a completely sane reaction  to some fucked-up circumstances. 
   That's it. 
   Circumstances are fucked-up. 
   And I took a bus all the way out here. 
   I don't even know where the f*ck we are right now. 
   So can you please grab a beer with me? 
   Yeah, sure.

  - Got to get down to the roots. 
   Okay, so that will take longer. 
   For all this, two weeks? 
   Now don't f*cking gouge me here, Hector. 
   Fine, 14 days. 
   - Good morning. 
  - Morning. 
   Let's get out of the f*cking sun, huh? 
   What... 
  what are they doing? 
   They're ripping it all up before... 
   she can get her hands on it. 
   Leonard, we need to... 
   Women sure have taken to life in the military, huh? 
   Generation or two, and they're as bad as the men. 
   What'd she say when I left? 
   Bunda? 
   Yeah, ha. 
  Bunda. 
   That's what I wanted to talk to you about. 
   Oh, not now with the sketches or whatever. 
   We're dealing with a fire here. 
   - This isn't a sketch. 
  - What is it? 
   An injunction. 
   What the f*ck is an injunction? 
   Guys, you need to stop! 
   Hector! 
  Stop! 
   "Critical military technology"? 
   What are they talking about? 
   The berry. 
   The berries? 
  That's... 
  they can't do this. 
   I talked to Legal. 
  They can. 
   It's my farm. 
  I live here. 
   You'll still own the company and the land,  but this material, this product,  it belongs to them now. 
   Why do you have this? 
   We spoke after you left. 
   You and Bunda? 
   She explained the situation. 
   Why you grew up quick, didn't you? 
   You can shove it up your ass. 
   Or take it to the Pentagon or wherever  and shove it up her ass. 
   I'm gonna clear this ground. 
   - Hector, get going! 
  - They can't! 
   Leonard! 
   "All parties are barred from the destruction..."  I can f*cking read! 
  I know what's in there. 
   "Or removal of any plants or means of production  related to the IP."  I'm not afraid of their f*ckin' IP. 
   I'm not talking about you. 
   Hector, the rest of them, they'll go to jail. 
   Is that what you want? 
   And then she'll bring in her own people and do it anyway. 
   This is happening. 
   All right, fine. 
  Guys! 
   - Stand down! 
   Thank you. 
  Um, now let's...

   ♪ ♪  So these notes are just for my boss. 
   You ready? 
   - Yeah. 
  - All right. 
   In your words, what do you feel led to the incident at the VA? 
   Uh... 
   unrealistic expectations, I guess. 
   What do you mean? 
   Well, I had a question about my treatment,  and for some reason I thought they'd answer it. 
   Yes. 
   That was optimistic of you. 
   - Yeah. 
  - What was the treatment? 
   They wouldn't tell me. 
  That was the problem. 
   What was your question about? 
   You're airborne, huh? 
   Yeah. 
   What was your MOS? 
   Are you gonna tell me what happened? 
   I just need to put it on my little form. 
   Okay, look, down at the VA, I lost control. 
   That's on me, okay? 
  You can tell your boss that. 
   I will, but I need... 
   And honestly, I appreciate the bail. 
   And I appreciate your interest, I do. 
   But if we keep talking about this,  I'm gonna get mad all over again. 
   So how about you just mark me "Evaluated"  and we drink a beer instead? 
   Sure. 
  That's not a problem. 
   - Great. 
  - Not a problem at all. 
   13F E4. 
   My MOS. 
   Artillery support? 
   3/187th. 
  Iron Rakkasans. 
   Wow. 
  That is hardcore. 
   I was the chick in the unit. 
  They put me on comms. 
   And was supposed to wash out, but I got really good at it. 
   The Zen of intel flow,  What do I know? 
  Who needs to know it? 
   Then I got deployed to Syria. 
   Damn. 
   We were dropping RAP rounds from 30 clicks. 
   We were so far away from the action,  and we were basically FOBBITs. 
   "Mushrooms, kept in the dark..."  "And fed sh1t."  Yeah. 
   Wow. 
   Then I got home,  and I found myself sitting in an apartment  under a freeway behind a Petco. 
   f*cking rented furniture. 
  Alone. 
   - American dream, bro. 
  - Exactly. 
   I used to spend all day, and I mean all day,  cleaning up that place. 
   Then I'd go out and I'd get hammered,  I come back and I'd pass out. 
   Rinse, repeat. 
   Rinse, repeat. 
   Until one day, I just... 
   I, um... 
   What happened? 
   I was driving to the gym,  and this guy with a man bun cuts me off. 
   One of those samurai top knots? 
   - Exactly. 
  - Jesus. 
   So I pull up next to him to explain his mistake,  and the fucker wouldn't even roll down his window. 
   So I found myself driving 110, chasing down his Tesla. 
   And lucky for him, those cars are fast. 
   You were gone, huh? 
   Oh, yeah, the police had to stop me  with one of those nail strips. 
   And even then, I'm like,  "I served. 
  Dude has a man bun. 
   What, you gonna lock me up for... 
   driving while veteran?"  Shoot, they tried to get me for looking at a monitor. 
   That's it? 
   Not exactly. 
   Guard comes up, tells me to drop it. 
   Then his little friend sneaks up behind me  and sh1t just gets crazy. 
   Next thing you know, I'm f*cking zip-tied. 
   One of them hands me a brochure for PTSD counseling  for the triggering incident I just experienced. 
   Check it out. 
  Look. 
   Oh, sh1t. 
   You are not making this up. 
   How can anybody make this sh1t up? 
   So what was on the screen? 
   I don't know. 
   I didn't see. 
   They did have me getting me treatment at this place though. 
   Geist. 
   Geist? 
   That's what they said, yeah. 
   What does that mean? 
  What... 
  what kind of treatment? 
   I don't know. 
   My unit got hit with an IED when I was over there. 
   Me, my buddy Shrier, this guy Lesky. 
   Ever since then I got this... 
   this big hole where the war was. 
   So you don't remember this place? 
   - No. 
  - Huh. 
   I mean, that's kind of what I wanted to see. 
   I thought maybe if I could just get some information... 
   Everything would start to make sense? 
   Yeah. 
   Optimistic though, right? 
   If you knew half the sh1t I've seen, from lost records,  to mismanagement, to just flat-out wrong. 
   They don't know what the f*ck they're doing over there. 
   - It's a total mess. 
  - Yeah, I know, but... 
   I had surgery. 
  I mean, my mom, she... 
   - She told me that when... 
  - When you first came back? 
   Yeah. 
   Everything was a blur for me those first few weeks. 
   Well, me too, but she did say it though. 
   Yeah, but maybe she was trying to scare you. 
   I mean, think about it, you bump your head,  you start feeling better, maybe you go back. 
   But if she tells you you had brain surgery  and you were in some sort of coma,  maybe you stay where she knows you're gonna be safe. 
   Does that sound like her? 
   What, lie to me for my own good? 
   A little bit, yeah. 
   God. 
   I mean, what if I really did just bump my head  and I'm making myself f*cking crazy for no reason? 
   Man, look, you're a waste of my time. 
   - What? 
  - You're barely f*cked up. 
   You're a really great guy who just had a rough day. 
   That's it. 
   So what, you're gonna put that on your form? 
   Of course. 
  With pleasure.

   He was looking for something else. 
   He's totally harmless. 
  He's such a sweetheart.

   The Ag Team has some ideas about increasing output  so you can restart the program and... 
   Oh, that... 
  we're not doing that. 
   Oh. 
   So then can I ask... 
   what are you gonna do with it? 
   - The juice? 
  - Yeah. 
   What do you think we should do with it? 
   Well, right now, we're in a box, an echo chamber. 
   We're thinking way too small about the product. 
   Such a waste. 
   Uh, of what? 
   Of you. 
   You should be running this place. 
   But so your plan is... 
   You know what, just stop it. 
   Your mind, I know, it wants to rush in  and nail everything down, what are we doing,  what is this product, blah, blah, blah. 
   It's all gonna just choke off creativity. 
   Okay. 
   I mean, you'll end up with the roller  or that PTSD thing down in Florida. 
   I mean, those are fine ideas. 
   - But what if... 
  - But what if what? 
   We open the door and let the f*cking crazy world in. 
   Whatever happens will be better than anything we come up with. 
   I'm not sure I understand. 
   You know, something happens at a school  and the kids are all freaked out. 
   Or Brazil thinks that if they de-traumatize 40,000 pigs,  it will make the bacon taste better. 
   Does Brazil think that? 
   I don't know. 
  I have no idea. 
   That's the point. 
   And the DOD does this kind of thing? 
   When they get a taste of it, they will. 
   And we just sell it  to whoever and... 
   Let the best idea win. 
   Doesn't that seem good?
