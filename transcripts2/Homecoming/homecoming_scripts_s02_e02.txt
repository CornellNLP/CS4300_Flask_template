  I didn't know what to say to Leonard. 
   I didn't know he was involved with the launch. 
   He's not. 
   This was supposed to be done by now. 
   I know. 
  The first balloon guy said  he couldn't rig anything that high. 
   So we had to get another balloon guy,  - and he said that it was... 
  - The DJ has all the music? 
   Oh. 
   Wait, was I supposed to... 
   Yes, Lane, you were supposed to. 
   We need to set the right tone. 
   Not a problem. 
   Uh, tell me about the tone. 
   What is the point of delegating this  if you're just gonna come back to me  with questions about every little detail? 
   Oh. 
  Sure. 
   Uh, we could do something that's fun but chill  and, you know, optimistic.

   We'll get everyone's feedback afterwards. 
   Please, have a seat. 
   I think I got some tangerine rind,  unless I was imagining that. 
   Okay, well, why don't we just hold off on all the comments  until everyone's had a chance  to complete the experience, okay? 
   Thanks. 
  Let's go again. 
   Where is Leonard now? 
   The greenhouse? 
   He's been in there all night, I think,  because the maintenance people went in  at, like, four this morning to feed the bugs. 
   He threw mulch at them. 
  Said he had to write a speech. 
   A speech about what? 
   This is the caterers. 
   Lemme just... 
  here... 
   I'm sorry. 
  I thought I gave you shipping.

   Let me find out about that. 
   Did you switch the catering service? 
   What do you want me to do with these? 
   - What? 
  - The rollers. 
   I'm off that project now, right? 
   Just find someplace for them, okay? 
   I'm kind of busy. 
   Sure thing, boss.

   ♪ ♪  I get canker sores from all citrus,  not just oranges. 
   - So for me... 
  - Right. 
  Yeah. 
   Uh, I think we've covered that, right? 
   The canker sores? 
   Does anyone else have any negative associations  with, um, citrus? 
   I do. 
   Give me more, though. 
   You don't like citrus because... 
   It's too easy. 
  You're, like, pandering. 
   "Pandering." Okay. 
  Interesting choice of words. 
   How did you arrive at that specific word? 
   Well, what I think he means is that  you're treating your customers like children. 
   So this is what you guys do? 
   - You make air freshener? 
  - No. 
   We make a full range of household products. 
   Soaps, cleaners, adhesives... 
   - You make soap? 
  - Yes. 
   And it's all plant-based. 
   Now, Devon, "pandering." That's a strong word. 
   - Let's try to unpack... 
  - I need to go to the restroom. 
   There's a bathroom near the sample area. 
   That's where we're finishing up today. 
   I'm not feeling well. 
   This is an emergency. 
   I need to use the restroom, please. 
   We're almost done. 
   Okay, Devon, we were talking  about your associations with citrus  being at odds with the core values of Geist. 
   Nixon, get out of there. 
   Good morning. 
   What do you want? 
   Why do you wanna speak at the launch? 
   Leonard, did you hear me? 
   I'm watching Airwolf. 
   It gets me fired up. 
   Well, they might not have Airwolf in jail. 
   You should bear that in mind before you... 
   Well, they might. 
   Guess we'll see. 
   You know you can't do this. 
  We need to... 
   Why are you talking to me like that? 
   Like what? 
   Well, like you know me. 
   Like we're some kind of team. 
   Two weeks ago,  I didn't even know  your f*ckin' name. 
   You know it now. 
   We can get through this, Leonard. 
   I know it feels like... 
   No, it doesn't feel... 
   I can f*ckin' see what's going on around me, okay? 
   I don't need therapy about it. 
   What I need is a f*ckin' chain saw. 
   I'm trying to help you.
