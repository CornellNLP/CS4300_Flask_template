 COLIN: How should we sum up? 
  Let me tell you a story. 
  We had a guy come in, three tours, great record. 
  The kind of guy you just You know what, I guess this is on a, on a personal level. 
  It's the kind of guy you just root for. 
  You know, smart, articulate, tons of potential. 
  He came into the program with anxiety, sleeplessness, fantasies of self-harm. 
  In the opening weeks, there were incidents of paranoia, even violence. 
  We were losing him. 
  Now, I I don't have to tell any of you what that's like, watching these guys slip away. 
  This is a month later. 
  "I feel great. 
  "For the first time in a long time, I'm looking forward to things. 
  " Now, of course we will keep a close watch over the next 18, 24 months, but for today, you can pick any metric you want: heart rate, sleep cycle, cognitive response. 
  Our guy is not "coping. 
  " He's not "making the best of it. 
  " He's cured. 
  He is cured. 
  And now what does he want more than anything? 
  He wants to get back to work. 
  (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) 
  Very impressive. 
  - Thank you, Colonel.

  The same dose as him, a week six? 
  I was hungry. 
  You are Okay, I I don't, uh, I don't understand this. 
  So then, and then you forced a a second meal on Walter Cruz, who'd already had his full dose? 
  - Yes. 
  - But that level I mean, he's he's already completed his cycle. 
  - He'll he'll be, uh - Adversely affected. 
  Adversely aff He's gonna be f*cking incapacitated! 
  The symptoms will take some time to leave his system, - if that's what you mean. 
  - H how long? 
  I don't know, a a year? 
  At least. 
  But what's the use, then, in H how can we deploy him like that? 
  (MEN WHISPERING IN BACKGROUND) 
  I guess we can't, you're right. 
  - Mr. 
  Belfast, maybe - Uh - Where is he now? 
  - Domestic reassignment. 
  Domestic You mean you sent - Mr. 
  Belfast? 
  - Stop. 
  He experienced adverse effects. 
  That's the protocol, isn't it? 
  He belongs with his family now. 
  COLIN: Why are you doing this? 
  I told you. 
  He doesn't want to go back. 
  So you f*cking reformatted him? 
  Are you insane? 
  It's possible. 
  Okay, you know what? 
  Nothing stops, you know that, right? 
  I I'm at the DoD right now. 
  They're they're talking about using the program institutionally, preemptively, even. 
  So if this is some kind of, you know, emotional, vindictive uh, I'm gonna be fine, okay? 
  Trust me. 
  Geist rewards results and I deliver. 
  You know what that means? 
  Huh, Heidi? 
  It means I'm headed to Redwood and you're heading to whatever f*cking suburb I pulled you out of. 
  - Colin, is there anything else? 
  - What? 
  Is there anything else you'd like to discuss? 
  I thought we were a team, Heidi. 
  I I really tried to mentor you, and you're just, you're taking all this hard work that we we did and you Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Colin, okay? 
  I just don't have a lot of time. 
  Don't move. 
  I'm coming down there and I'm gonna screw your f*cking head on straight, - you hear me? 
  - I won't be here. 
  What? 
  Hello? 
  Hello? 
  f*ck! 
  I - Good afternoon, Colin. 
  - Where's Ron? 
  I'm not sure. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  Okay, well, while we're waiting, uh, you mind grabbing me a coffee? 
  - How was the funeral? 
  - The what? 
  Your aunt in Milwaukee? 
  Right, yes. 
  Thank you. 
  Or was that in Florida? 
  Hmm? 
  You went to Tampa as well, is that right? 
  I don't think I can bring you in on that. 
  It's it's really Ron's call. 
  Why did you go Tampa? 
  Well, I go to a lot of places, Audrey. 
  It's kind of part of the job. 
  What were you doing at the Homecoming facility? 
  What what was I doing? 
  Yes. 
  Uh, let's just wait for Ron to get here, okay? 
  And then you can take your little notes or whatever it is you do. 
  What happened to your face? 
  It's I (CHUCKLES) 
  Okay. 
  I see what this is. 
  Look, Audrey, I think it's great that you're ambitious. 
  I do. 
  I love it. 
  Okay? 
  We need all kinds here. 
  But let's remember who you are, and who I am. 
  Okay? 
  Now why don't you step outside and see if you can track Ron down? 
  Ron's not coming, Colin. 
  Why not? 
  He's not with us anymore. 
  What do you mean? 
  Ron's running the new division. 
  We're launching the roller. 
  Yes, that will all continue, just without Ron. 
  When did this happen? 
  Today. 
  Today? 
  Why? 
  Ron overextended himself. 
  And so what are you doing here? 
  I'm in a new role. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Should we continue? 
  When you were at the facility, did you confront a Department of Defense investigator What is what are what is What are you looking at there? 
  and offer a sort of confession and then taunt him? 
  My back was to the wall, Audrey, okay? 
  I was trying to Okay, you know what? 
  He's filing that complaint, okay, that that's just reality, so we should focus on that. 
  Okay. 
  What do you suggest? 
  What do I suggest? 
  We give them someone. 
  A rogue employee? 
  Yeah, that's right. 
  Disobeyed protocol. 
  Exactly. 
  Bergman got, I don't know, emotional, - and she - Not she. 
  What? 
  We're not talking about Bergman. 
  This describes your role in what happened. 
  You should look it over and What, you think you could fix this without me? 
  Who who eliminated the memory hiccup? 
  Who pivoted the medication to comfort management? 
  The the roller, Audrey, that's all me. 
  Mr. 
  Geist and I discussed all of that. 
  If you take responsibility for your actions, it would mean a lot to him. 
  It could affect your future here. 
  You talked to to Geist? 
  Yes, at his farm. 
  Have you been? 
  No, I I I haven't. 
  It's a beautiful property. 
  I am so excited for you, Audrey. 
  I'm so excited that they have finally recognized your skills, and I am here and willing to assist in any way possible. 
  I'm a problem solver. 
  I really I really am. 
  You were a problem solver. 
  What? 
  But now you are a problem. 
  And this is the solution. 
  (VOICES CHATTER IN DISTANCE) 
  - (DOOR OPENS) 
  - CORY: Walter? 
  We're gonna move you to a chair, okay? 
  Hey, buddy, nice and easy. 
  (MUFFLED): Here we go. 
  Let's get you on your feet. 
  There you go. 
  A few steps There you go. 
  There we go. 
  (DOGS BARKING) 
  Heidi? 
  Heidi? 
  (VOICE ECHOING): Heidi? 
  (KNOCKS HARDER ON WINDOW) 
  Heidi. 
  (KNOCKING) 
  (ECHOING): Heidi, open the door. 
  (SOUND SLOWS, DISTORTS) 
  Heidi, open the door. 
  - Honey? 
  - (SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL) 
  (DOGS BARKING) 
  Heidi look at me. 
  Heidi, unlock the door, honey. 
  Unlock the door. 
  Unlock the door, honey. 
  Unlock (KNOCKS) 
  Heidi Here's your car, soldier. 
  What have you done to him? 
  (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
  Hello. 
  Hi. 
  Do you remember me? 
  Yes. 
  I would like to talk to you. 
  What do you want? 
  Just to to tell you what happened, what we did. 
  Now? 
  What's that gonna change? 
  Nothing, but you would know the truth, if that's what you want. 
  You can sit. 
  The facility housed, um, 18 soldiers at a time. 
  We used their medical records to find men under 30 who had certain symptoms, basic PTSD markers. 
  The men all signed waivers. 
  They were used to that. 
  And then we began the sessions. 
  We would identify a target memory. 
  Something they did? 
  It didn't have to be, just something resonant, something intrusive. 
  We delivered the medication through meals over the course of six weeks, and each week we would, uh, discuss the targeted memory to see if the response changed. 
  What does that mean? 
  To see if the memories were deleted. 
  That was your job? 
  Yes. 
  The therapy, the activities it was all for appearances. 
  All that, just so that you could send them back? 
  Yes. 
  He thought you were helping him. 
  I know. 
  GLORIA: It worked. 
  Whatever you did. 
  Walter called me to tell me that he wasn't coming home. 
  He sounded happy. 
  But then, two days later, the Geist people called to tell me to come get him. 
  I didn't know what to think. 
  Then I got your envelope, the recordings. 
  Those belong to Walter. 
  I was trying I understand what you did. 
  I don't forgive you. 
  I don't want you to. 
  Those years were taken from him. 
  Walter wanted to believe. 
  That was the best thing about him. 
  And you used that. 
  I understand. 
  I do. 
  I've learned that there are certain objects or cues from that time that could bring back Walter's memories, and if I Why would we do that? 
  So that he can remember He's finally back to who he was before this whole mess. 
  The war, what you did to him, that place. 
  I just You want to help Walter? 
  Yes. 
  Then stay away from him. 
  You made mistakes. 
  My son paid the price. 
  Now you want to come back for another try? 
  He doesn't want that. 
  Any of it. 
  He's finally where he belongs. 
  HEIDI: So, what did we say, Yosemite? 
  Yeah, or around there. 
  Where do we stop? 
  I don't know, I guess we'll just go until we've gone far enough. 
  What are we looking for? 
  We'll know when we see it. 
  Gas station, hardware store, little cafÃ©. 
  Right? 
  Up in the mountains, by the creek. 
  One stoplight, that's it. 
  And then we just disappear. 
  Wait, don't we need jobs? 
  Nope. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
 
 
 
  Why not? 
  Well, it's gold country, isn't it? 
  Yeah. 
  Or it used to be. 
  Yeah, well, there's gotta be something left. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Sure. 
  Guess we don't need much. 
  - What, a couple million? 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  Yeah. 
  We'll get a cabin by the creek, big pile of firewood, wake up with the sun. 
  We'll just head out to the creek and we'll We Pan? 
  (BOTH LAUGH) 
  Yeah, we pan for gold. 
  I mean, how hard could it be? 
  Yeah, it's just sitting there in the creek. 
  Right? 
  We just pan it out. 
  (BOTH LAUGH) 
  Get all the gold we need and we'll be rich. 
  Or we don't find anything. 
  Right. 
  Claim's tapped out. 
  The winter comes. 
  The roads close. 
  But we keep trying. 
  The storm hits. 
  We're stuck. 
  We use up all the firewood, and we freeze to death. 
  Could happen. 
  But we died trying. 
  - It's honorable is what it is. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  And we don't care what anybody thinks because we're dead in the snow. 
  WALTER: Just a couple of snow angels. 
  No one to bother us. 
  Or maybe we get lucky. 
  Right. 
  Hey, you want to hang on to this? 
  Just while I'm gone. 
  Sure. 
  This food is very good. 
  - I'm impressed. 
  - I know, right? 
  Heading out? 
  Want some coffee? 
  Ooh! 
  I am el hombre Lobo On the prowl for a restless night I got her right here in my sights Got a fuse that I can light She's tremendous, she's dynamite She is a formidable opponent She could put up a hard-won fight Got her head screwed on real tight Being the bomb is her birthright She's tremendous, she's dynamite (BIRDS SINGING)

  Deck's turning into a real m*therf*cker, huh?

  (CHUCKLES) 
  WAITRESS: Hey, Walter.

  This just seemed like a nice place, this town. 
  Here? 
  Yeah, it is. 
  It's kind of the end of the road, if you're into that sort of thing. 
  And you are? 
  Into that? 
  I guess. 
  I've always wanted to come out here. 
  Me, too. 
  You know, I was sort of just driving around and I saw this little place for sale. 
  - A cabin? 
  - Yeah. 
  Near a creek?

  To see the empty road at happy hour gleam And resonate Just like the gates Around the holy kingdom With words like "lost and found" And "don't look down" (ENGINE STARTS) 
  And "someone save temptation," and please Remember me As in the dream We had as rug-burned babies Among the fallen trees And fast asleep Beside the lions and the ladies That called you what you like And even might Give a gift for your behavior A fleeting chance to see A trapeze Swinger high as any savior But please, remember me Finally And all my uphill clawing My dear But if I make The pearly gates I'll do my best to make a drawing Of God and Lucifer A boy and girl An angel kissing on a sinner A monkey and a man A marching band All around a frightened trapeze swinger Nah, nah nah-nah Nah nah-nah Nah, nah Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah I'm complying here. 
  I'm a team player.
