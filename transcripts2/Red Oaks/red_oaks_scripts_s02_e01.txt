 What happened to your roommate? 
 She fell in love with her dance teacher and moved out. 
 I thought about getting another one, but... you know, I like the quiet. 
 And I figured a spare room might come in handy. 
 So is that where I'm sleeping? 
 If you're bad. 
 Wow. These are really good. 
 You think so? 
 Yeah. 
 Not that you weren't good before, but... these are really something. 
 It's hard not to be inspired here. 
 What's this? 
 It's just a little something I saw in a shop window on the Rue Saint-Honoré, like months ago. 
 Wow. 
 I knew your old one had broken. 
 And I thought you could use it to document your visit, like a journal. 
 Now I feel like a total jerk. I didn't bring you anything. 
 It's not true. 
 ♪ ♪  (woman singing in French) 
 And that's what's so amazing about the French, they have this completely different attitude towards life. 
 What do you mean? 
 Work is not the center of their lives. 
 It's sharing a bottle of wine at lunch, or... or lingering over a meal with friends until way past midnight, or making love in the morning, even if it means being late to the office. 
 But is that everyone, or just your average French office worker? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, it sounds awesome. 
 I just wonder if you can stay up all night, drink wine at lunch, and still be a great artist or write an amazing novel. 
 Sometimes I wonder if that is not the whole point. 
 It's not the paintings that you leave behind that are important, it's how you lived. 
 Like this, what we're doing right now. 
 This is the real canvas. 
 All right, is the water boiling? 
 Yep. 
 Do you wanna hand me the snails? 
 Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 sh1t, some of them got out. 
 They're making a break for it? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't really wanna touch them. 
 It's like the lobsters in Annie Hall, only slower. 
 (laughs)  Oh, kiss me, David. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (chuckles) 
 Have things gotten any better at school? 
 No. 
 It's so crazy that they don't offer any film classes. 
 Well, it's community college. It's for people who wanna become computer programmers or paralegals. 
 Only thing they offer is a class in TV production for Communication majors. 
 But, f*ck, who wants to work in TV? 
 I think you'd make a cute paralegal. 
 I would look terrible in a skirt. 
 I have "knobbly" knees. 
 Oh, no you don't. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 They're here. 
 We went to Montmartre today to see Truffaut's grave. 
 You like Jules et Jim? 
 Oh, it's the best. 
 I love that it has a narrator. 
 Uh, you know, not voiceover, but someone actually telling the story, who knows everything about the characters... what they're thinking and feeling, and even stuff they don't know about themselves, which is ironic 'cause Jules and Jim and this girl Catherine that they both love, they've been living lives of total freedom from convention and morality, and that that's gonna keep them young and happy forever. 
 But they're not. And it doesn't. 
 Sorry. My English, it's, um... not very good. 
 (speaking French) 
 You ever get homesick? 
 For New Jersey? 
 How often do you talk to your folks. 
 My father calls about every week from his work to yell at me about how much I'm charging to his credit card. 
 (both chuckle) 
 But overall, we're getting along much better. 
 I think it's healthier for us to have an ocean between us. 
 How's your father? 
 (sighs)  Not great. 
 He's still pretty bummed about having to close his accounting business. 
 Did he find a new job? 
 Not yet. 
 It must be hard for him, having to try to find work at his age. 
 I think most things are hard for my father He's just one of those people who doesn't seem capable of being happy. 
 It's funny. 
 What is? 
 How we're nothing like our parents. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 (chuckles)  Why are you making that weird face? 
 I'm concentrating. 
 On what? 
 Not getting a boner. 
 Say something to distract me. 
 Um, when do Bergen Community's winter sessions start? 
 Next week. 
 Are there any classes you're even a little interested in taking? 
 Not really. 
 You wanna make movies, right? 
 Yeah. 
 So make them. 
 It's not that easy. There's a ton you have to learn. 
 And it's expensive. You need cameras, film stock, sound equipment, lights. 
 With a film program like NYU, you can borrow that stuff, but it's pretty much impossible to do on your own. 
 It's not like being a painter or a writer, where all you need is paper. 
 I just hate to see you give up on a dream. 
 (doorbell rings) 
 Our Indian food. 
 I'll get it. 
 Don't move a muscle. 
 (speaks French) 
 Surprise! 
 (laughing) 
 My darling! Mwah! 
 (laughing) 
 I told you we should have called you first. 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 We're gonna let our baby girl be alone on New Year's Eve? 
 How are you even allowed to leave the country? 
 What? I'm innocent till proven guilty. 
 And I'm not gonna be proven anything, because it's a bullshit case. 
 And that rodeo clown Giuliani, he knows that, so don't even get me started. 
 The judge didn't put any travel restrictions on your father's bail. 
 Go wherever I wanna go. 
 So you guys came straight from the airport? 
 Hello! Look at this. I'm such a mess. 
 Your father was so excited to surprise you, he's just like a little kid. 
 Surprise! 
 How long have you guys been planning this? 
 No plans. 
 Spur of the moment. Just like that. 
 We used to do this all time. 
 Before you, when we were dating, we would just do that, we'd pick up and go anytime we want. 
 Take a tooth brush. 
 Thank God we got a room at the Bristol. 
 That's a lot of luggage for just toothbrushes. 
 How long are you staying exactly? 
 I don't even know. Give us the tour. 
 Uh, wait. 
 Wow, look at this. 
 Are you eating? You look very thin. 
 Oh, my God. Look at this place. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Darling, this is adorable. 
 Oh, it kind of reminds me of the place we had on the Upper West Side. 
 Yeah, except we had elevators. 
 I love these old buildings. You can almost smell the history. 
 That's paint fumes. 
 Speaking of which... 
 Let's see how those expensive art lessons are coming along. 
 How are we doing. All righty. 
 Look at that. Isn't that something? 
 Oh, okay. Very nice. Very nice job, sweetheart. 
 I can't speak to the likeness of it, but, uh, you know, you certainly got the posture. 
 Posture? 
 They're beautiful, darling. 
 You know what else is beautiful? Fruit. 
 You see a lot of paintings of fruit. 
 Lighthouses? 
 Doug! 
 A pony. You can paint a pony. 
 You don't have to be staring at a pony's ass. 
 All right. Oh, okay, who's this fella now? 
 Um, that's my friend Sami. 
 Sami. How do you get them to pose for you like that? 
 I pay 40 francs an hour. 
 40 francs an hour? 
 They don't give you, like, a friend discount, huh? 
 It's nice that she's generous with her friends. 
 With my money. So technically, I'm being generous to her friends. 
 Darling, I'm so tired. Can we please check into the hotel? 
 I'm exhausted. 
 Great idea. 
 Yeah, you should rest up. 
 We just got here. 
 We have plenty of time to catch up later. 
 That's right, darling. 
 Yeah. 
 Will you get us a dinner reservation somewhere? Somewhere nice? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 All right. 
 Just unpack and rest. Rest up. 
 It'll be good. Come on. 
 Doug! 
 Doug : Yeah, okay. All right. 
 Let's go. All right. 
 So what we say, like, dinner tonight, like 7-7:30? 
 Something like that? 
 Yeah, perfect. 
 See you tonight. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Holy sh1t.  (chuckles) 
 What are we gonna do? 
 So what is this big surprise you keep promising? 
 Just another minute. 
 Why don't you have some more wine? 
 Mom? 
 Hmm. 
 It's a boy. 
 Don't be so sure. 
 I'm telling you, I know her, so you better prepare yourself. 
 Surprise. 
 Hi, Mr. Getty, Mrs. Getty. 
 You look nice. 
 Thanks. You, too. 
 Man : Et vous, Monsieur. 
 And I'll have the "loop de mere." 
 Merci. 
 Merci, mademoiselle. 
 I'm just going to run to the toilette. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 (footsteps departing) 
 It's the lying that I'm most pissed off about. 
 I'm sorry? 
 All that horseshit last summer. 
 You want the bonus money so you can get yourself an apartment in the city. 
 It wasn't a lie. It wasn't a lie. 
 Oh, really? Did you get a place? 
 Well, no. I was going to, but I dropped out of NYU, so it didn't make much sense. 
 So then you took my money and bought a plane ticket to come here to schtup my daughter. 
 Your poor father, he was so looking forward to spending some quality time with you. 
 That's not my fault. 
 I don't think you know how much stress he is under. 
 You do realize he can go to prison. 
 He might even be banned from working on Wall Street for life. 
 (snaps) 
 You think about that. 
 Tout fromage? 
 What? No. Just the check. 
 (both speaking French) 
 Who the hell eats cheese after a meal? 
 The French. 
 Well, that's why they're not a superpower anymore. 
 'Cause their priorities are all messed up. 
 Okay, let's get you home to bed, baby. 
 Yes. We will all feel better after a good night's sleep. 
 And tomorrow, remember, we have a very long day of sightseeing. 
 
 
 
 Hmm? 
 Monsieur. 
 Mmm. 
 Can I? 
 David, don't be silly. 
 Please. 
 Sure. 
 'Cause it's a big one. 
 Uh... of course. I mean, I wouldn't have offered... 
 Daddy, no. 
 Darling, please. 
 No. 
 I think that's very generous of you, David. 
 Thank you. 
 There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 I'll pay you back. 
 No, it's okay. Really, it's fine. 
 Here we go. There you go. 
 Well, see you in the morning. 
 You know, I just wanna say a little change of plan. 
 And for the record, this is not my idea. 
 We're gonna check out of the Bristol, and we're gonna stay with you. 
 (singsong)  Surprise. 
 David, wait. Don't go. 
 It's okay. 
 No, I'll make them get a hotel room. 
 No, they're your family. 
 Then we'll all stay at my place. It's big enough. 
 And we're all adults. 
 Definitely not. 
 It isn't fair. 
 I don't want them to ruin our time together. 
 They won't. I promise. 
 I just think its best for everyone if I find someplace else to stay. 
 I guess you're right. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll check into some youth hostel or something. 
 What? No. 
 Come on. 
 Where are we going? 
 My friends' Claire and Etienne's place from the other night? 
 I'm sure they won't mind if you sleep on their sofa for a couple of nights. 
 Interesting. 
 Thanks again. 
 Sweet dreams. 
 (switch clicks) 
 (passionate moaning in distance) 
 (siren in distance) 
 Bonjour. 
 Hi. 
 You sleep okay? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Good. 
 You want to join us? 
 Excuse me? 
 With us. 
 For food. 
 Oh. Oh, sure. 
 Oh, yeah. Great. 
 Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Yeah.

 Just not sleeping. That facacta bed she's got is killing my back. 
 Can we please move back to the Bristol? 
 No, we can't. I flew 3,000 miles to spend time together as a family. 
 And that's what we're gonna do. 
 Bad enough I gotta share with this little fucker. 
 (exhales) 
 I don't get it. 
 It's a man with a dead tiger on his head. 
 What's to get? 
 No, him. 
 I don't get what she sees in him. 
 Skinny little merink college dropout. 
 He'll end up being a shoe salesman or something. 
 You know what I don't get? 
 Why you're letting this boy get under your skin more than the others she's brought home. 
 That's another thing. She never brought him home. 
 Why? We used to have such a good relationship. 
 Not all this sneaking around. 
 Darling. Please. 
 Try not to ruin our time here together. 
 Who knows when we'll be back here, hmm? 
 You're right. 
 Hmm. 
 You're right. 
 Now. 
 If you are a good boy... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ...I will let you buy me something expensive.

 You know that always cheers you up. 
 It kind of does.

 What the hell kind of place is this, anyway? 
 Isn't it fun? You would never find a place like this in New York. 
 Thank God. 
 This is what you get when you elect a socialist. 
 Does anyone know the time? 
 Oh, wait a second, I do. It's almost midnight. 
 It's really gorgeous, Mom. 
 I know! 
 Could you die? I'm going to be buried in this thing. 
 It looks very nice on you, baby. 
 You know what looks nice on you? 
 Hmm? 
 Lipstick. 
 I can't believe it's almost 1986. 
 I can't believe your father and I have been married 25 years this summer. 
 Really? Wow! 
 Wow. What's your secret? 
 Not asking stupid f*cking questions. 
 Daddy. 
 I need another drink. 
 Let me get that for you. 
 Will you get me one, too? 
 Sure. 
 I hope your using protection. 
 Mother. 
 Excuse me. Hey, chief. Yo. 
 Buddy. What's with this guy? 
 He must hate Americans. 
 Guess they forget if it weren't for us, this would be a beer garden. 
 Think you'd take a shot at Feinberg for the club championship next summer? 
 I don't know. 
 If you wanted to, we could train this winter. 
 I'm teaching at a club downtown. 
 Don't. 
 No, Nash says he has a friend at one in Midtown, so... 
 Not that, this. What you're doing, don't do this. 
 What am I doing? 
 Trying to bond. I don't need it. 
 Oh, I thought I was just making conversation. 
 Look, I'm gonna be straight with you. 
 You're a nice enough kid. 
 You're just not good enough for my daughter. 
 And I don't say that to offend you. 
 This is not about me being an overprotective father. 
 This is just me being a good judge of character. 
 In my line of work, you get very good at picking winners. 
 And when I look at you, that's not what I see. 
 There you are. What's taking you so long? 
 Come on. We gotta go. It's time. 
 David, hey. 
 Come on. What's wrong? 
 Uh, nothing. No, I...

 Did you say something to David? 
 Hmm? What? 
 Ever since New Year's Eve, he's been acting kind of subdued. 
 No. We had a little talk. 
 About what? 
 You know, his future and his intentions with my little daughter. 
 Okay. we're ready. 
 Darling, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye. I love you. 
 You take care of yourself. Don't get too skinny. 
 And call us, all right? Darling, we gotta go. 
 You bet. 
 Bye. 
 David. 
 Doug : Need some money? 
 Muchas gracias. 
 Doug : Take some. You'll have it. 
 You gotta a nice little life here, sweetheart. 
 I know the plan is for you to come back in May, but I was thinking... 
 Why don't you extend your stay a little bit? 
 And what about school? 
 You transfer. 
 They have a nice thing at the Sorbonne. 
 I mean, Mom and I would miss you, obviously, but we'll come visit. 
 It's not like we don't know our way around now. 
 Think about it. It's an idea. 
 Sweetheart, we gotta go. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 We're gonna miss the plane. 
 Okay. 
 Darling. 
 Jesus Christ.

 Have a good flight, Mr. Getty.

 Don't worry, darling.

 Okay. 
 It's the longest week of my life. 
 You okay? 
 Huh? 
 Fine. 
 Oh! 
 ♪♪ 
 I don't want you to go. 
 Me neither. 
 Then don't. 
 What do you mean? 
 It's not like there's anything waiting for you back home in New Jersey. 
 I mean, you hate school. 
 You said yourself that it's a waste of time, and you wanna drop out. 
 So do it. 
 What would I do here? 
 Learn French. 
 Travel. Make short films. 
 Well, for starters, I couldn't afford it. 
 I mean, this trip has wiped out most of my savings. 
 What would I do for money? 
 I'll support us. 
 No. No way. 
 Give me one reason. 
 'Cause you wouldn't be supporting us. 
 Your father would. 
 And I'm pretty sure there's a rule about how long a person could stay in a foreign country. 
 God. Don't be so rational. 
 Well, I don't know how not to be. 
 I'd like to. I really would. 
 I'm just... 
 It's not that easy for me. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 The summer will be here before you know it. 
 You'll come home, and we'll be together. 
 Unless I don't. 
 Don't what? 
 Come home? 
 My father offered to let me stay and transfer to the Sorbonne. 
 Wow. 
 Is that what you want?
