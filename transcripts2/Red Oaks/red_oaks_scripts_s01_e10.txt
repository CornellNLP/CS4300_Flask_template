 [footsteps] 
 So have you talked to Karen? 
 Hmm? 
 Well, sometimes people just grow apart. 
 At least drink your juice. 
 You look nice. 
 Oh. Thanks, sweetie. 
 I've got my real estate license exam today, so wish me luck. 
 You don't need it, Mom. 
 You're going to do great. 
 Sam : Come on, buddy. 
 We got to go. We'll be late. 
 Okay, well... 
 Listen, you know it's been a tough summer. 
 Your father and I want you to know that if you ever need to talk to anyone, we're here. Okay? 
 And change is good. Right? 
 For all of us. 
 Come on. 
 Okay, Bye-bye. 
 Let's go. 
 Sam : Geez-Louise. Okay. 
 Well, get them from Other Expenses. 
 Look... No, no, no. Not in that file. 
 Like two or three below. 
 Here, give them to me. Give them to me. 
 Thank you. 
 [phone rings] 
 All right. 
 This is what I'm looking for. 
 [ring] 
 Fine. Call them and... 
 David, would you get the phone, please? 
 [ring] 
 I don't know where their... 
 Certified public accountant. 
 Wheeler : Dude, you look f*cking miserable. 
 I just drove past you. 
 I asked you for spreadsheets... 
 Where are you? 
 Just come outside. I'm outside, baby. 
 Let's go. Let's party. I'm here to rescue you. 
 Don't they know this is America? 
 You have some old tax returns of theirs? 
 Wheeler : Dude. 
 What are you doing with Getty's car? 
 Ah, just getting it washed. 
 Figured I'd make a little detour, see how you're doing. 
 Nice. 
 So? 
 How's it working for your pops? 
 Remember the scene in Apocalypse Now when Martin Sheen loses his sh1t in a Saigon hotel? 
 [laughing] That bad? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 I heard Barry decided not to press charges. 
 Mm-hmm. Only on the condition I pay for the camera he claims got busted when I hit him. Between that, paying for the cake that got trashed, and some other damages, I'm pretty much wiped out. 
 The money I saved all summer? Gone. 
 Me, too. 
 What about the money you made dealing? 
 Went to repay Ganz, plus I had to, uh, sell my car. 
 The Trans? 
 The Trans Am. 
 How's Misty? 
 Oh, boy. 
 She hasn't talked to me since she found out about all that sh1t. Coke stuff. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What are you going to do? 
 What about you and Karen? 
 Nothing. 
 It's terrible. It's not good. 
 You still thinking about getting a place in the city? 
 I can't afford it, not without that bonus Getty promised me. 
 I'm stuck here. 
 This sucks. 
 No. No, no, no, no. f*ck our attitudes, man. 
 We're a bunch of crybabies. 
 I'm not letting you give up. 
 I'm not giving up. I'm just being realistic. 
 You're being a pussy, and it ends now. 
 You're going to get in this car. 
 We're going to drive to the club. 
 You're going to find Getty, and you're gonna ask for your job back. 
 Hell, you f*cking beg if you have to. 
 You really think it'll work? 
 No. No way. 
 But you got to at least try. 
 That's what life is, man. It's a game... 
 David, come on. Enough chitchat. 
 It's time to get back to work. 
 Very good to see you, Mr. Myers. 
 My, uh, stepfather says hello. 
 How are you? David, let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Come on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You all right? 
 [engine starts] 
 David, where are you going? 
 David. 
 Mr. Getty? 
 What the hell do you want? 
 My old job back. 
 Why? Season's over. 
 Not quite. There's one week left, which means we don't have much time to get your ready for the club tennis championship. 
 I'm ready. 
 With all due respect, sir. 
 I don't believe you are. 
 I see that your tennis elbow has flared up again, which tells me you're pro-netting during your serve and that your timing is off so you're hitting the ball too late. 
 Nobody knows your game like I do. 
 You need me. And I need that bonus. 
 Okay. 
 See you on the court. 
 Aah! 
 [no audible dialogue] 
 [no audible dialogue] 
 Go. 
 Nice. 
 [grunt] 
 Yeah. 
 [horn honks] 
 Ship : Aloha. 
 Where's Wheeler? 
 All right. I don't know, dude. 
 Hey, does anybody know where Wheeler is? 
 [brakes screech] 
 All right, just keep coming up. 
 That's fine. Just a little farther up. 
 Hey, Misty. 
 Just wait. Can you talk? 
 I'm late for work. What? 
 Listen, I just want to let you know I sold my Trans Am to pay off my, uh, coke supplier, so I can't give you a lift home unless you want to, you know, go with my mom and my brother and sister, which wouldn't be that cool. 
 No, I'm fine. I'll get another ride. Thanks. 
 Hey, wait. Um, Ganz offered me a chance to work off what I owed him, but I said no. I'm done. 
 No more selling coke. 
 From now on, just sticking to weed. 
 Why'd you do it in the first place? 
 For the money. 
 And to impress you. I mean, Jesus Christ, I just wanted you to think I was cool. 
 I can think of a million better ways. 
 I thought you were a smart guy. 
 I am a smart guy. 
 f*ck. 
 Hey, what did you decide about community college? 
 [sigh] Classes start in two weeks. 
 Awesome. 
 What about you? 
 What are you doing this fall? 
 Actually, funny enough, you inspired me to give school another try. 
 So thank you. 
 Seriously? 
 Don't get me wrong. 
 I still think higher education is mostly a scam invented by the futon industry, but... 
 Yeah. Right. it beats sticking around here. 
 It's not so bad. 
 All right, well... 
 [snap] 
 ♪ ♪ [ukulele] 
 Spirits? 
 Yeah? Shim-shim-shimmy? 
 So first you start with the waves. 
 Waves. Up and up and up. 
 Other side. 
 Kind of sing your praises of the birds. 
 And shimmy. 
 Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. 
 There you girls go. 
 You girls are so good at this. 
 All right, girls, go get some free ice cream up there. 
 Go, go, go. Good job, everyone. 
 [girls squealing] 
 Yay! 
 Go ahead, boys. 
 You guys can go get some ice cream. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 How are you? 
 Fine. You? 
 Yeah. Uh, good. 
 Barry decided not to press charges. 
 I figured you probably had something to do with that, so thanks. 
 Yeah. You're welcome. 
 Uh, it's been weird not talking. 
 I know. 
 Maybe a good thing, you know? 
 Gave me time to think about the stuff you said about me needing to grow up. 
 I was just upset. 
 Yeah, but not wrong. 
 I do need to grow up. 
 And I've been trying to think more about the future, but it's not as easy for me as other people. 
 I mean, look at you. You've known since you were 14 that you wanted to be a nurse and have a big house with kids and a cat. 
 [sigh] I... I just, you know, wish... 
 I wish I knew I wanted the same things, but I don't. 
 I mean, maybe... maybe some day I will. 
 But right now... 
 I don't know. I just don't know. 
 I wouldn't mind you not knowing what you wanted if I just knew... that you... wanted me. 
 You know. 
 Give me a seltzer and lime. 
 Staying away from the hard stuff today? 
 Hydrating. 
 Hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 Right, for the big match. 
 You got it. 
 So, uh, how's the kid been as coach? 
 Kid's been good. 
 Tough? 
 Mm. 
 That's good. 
 Hey, did you ever end up getting that boat? 
 Alas, I did not. 
 Well, you are wise to wait because rumor has it Galexa's stock is going to split by the end of the year, so you can get yourself a whole fleet of boats. 
 I sold. 
 You what? 
 All of it, two weeks ago. 
 In the middle of a rally you cashed out? 
 I came out ahead. I still made money. 
 Nothing. Not any real money. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Ah... Okay. 
 So you're back. 
 Guess my father couldn't survive without you. 
 I don't feel like talking right now. 
 I'm confused why I haven't heard from you since New York. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm confused why you never told me you had a boyfriend. 
 Mark and I are not together. 
 Well, your dad thinks so. 
 Well, he's mistaken. 
 Ever thought of setting him straight? 
 That would just make him angry. 
 Isn't that the point? 
 I mean, come on, Skye. We both know. that's the only reason why you asked me to the city: because you're bored and spoiled, and you like to use guys to piss off your folks, which is fine. Whatever. Have fun. 
 Just do me a favor. Leave me out of it. 
 Mahalo. 
 What's this? 
 A virgin G&T. 
 So tonic? 
 And lime. 
 Mm. 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 Come on. What's a guy got to do to turn that frown upside-down? 
 Just give me time. 
 I'm in no hurry. 
 We can go slow. 
 There it is. 
 What can I say? I have a gift. 
 Getty : All right, is everybody having fun? 
 [cheering] 
 Yeah! 
 All right. Well, it's hard to believe another summer is coming to an end, uh, but there's plenty of fun left, including the Red Oaks Men's Tennis Singles Championship. 
 Not, uh, not to plug myself, but I will be competing in that. 
 You'll win. 
 All right, honey, not in front of everybody. 
 As is our tradition here at Red Oaks, we have... Our very own Nasser is going to sing a song he has prepared in honor of this year's Labor Day Luau. 
 Nasser, step on up here. 
 How about a hand for Nasser? 
 All right.

 David : Get ready. 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
 He's a baseliner, so you're going to want to hit the ball deep with plenty of top spin. 
 Have you been seeing my daughter? 
 What? No. 
 No? 
 No. 
 Man : Hey, what's going on? 
 We hung out, like, one time. 
 But, you know, she's not interested in me. 
 She was just doing it to piss you off. 
 Well, it's working. 
 Nasser : All right, gentlemen, let's get this started, shall we? 
 Getty.

 I hear you've been training a bit. 
 A little bit. 
 Haven't got to play as much as I'd like to, between work and all the charities my wife's got me involved in. 
 Just save the excuses for after the match. 
 We'll see, buddy. 
 Okay.

 Man : Douglas Getty? 
 Yes? 
 FBI. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Excuse me. On what charges? 
 Insider trading securities and mail fraud, aiding in the filing of false documents, providing false statements to the government, and conspiracy. 
 That's horse sh1t. 
 That is total horse sh1t. 
 Horse sh1t. You know that, right? 
 No, Dad, no. 
 Don't you think for a minute I don't know what's going on here. 
 Please, this is about insider trading? 
 This is about you-know-who in the mayor's office, hmm? 
 You don't have the decency to do this at my husband's office. 
 You have to come here and embarrass us in front of all of our friends, you piece of sh1t! 
 Don't worry, darling. Everyone, just enjoy yourselves. This is so stupid. 
 They don't know what they're talking about. 
 Oh, my God. Don't worry about it.

 Hey, bite me, dickface. 
 Happy Labor Day. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. Taking off? 
 Yeah. Will I see you around next summer? 
 Maybe. Maybe not. 
 What do you mean, maybe? 
 I was just trying to play cool. 
 That's a bad idea. 
 You think so? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you're right.

 Yes, this. Well, unfortunately, I won't be needing this for some time. 
 What about your boat? 
 I decided to purchase a new car for my wife instead. 
 And there she is. 
 She decided to take you back? 
 My sweet bam-bam? Yes, she did, indeed. 
 She always does. She pretends not to, but she misses me dearly. Wouldn't you? 
 It's a nice car. 
 Ha ha! 
 It's like i always say : the smart money is in the stock market. 
 Herb : Heh. 
 I got to hand it to you, kid. 
 I didn't think you'd last the summer. 
 Me, neither. 
 You going to come back next year? 
 I hope so. 
 Well, just in case I kick the bucket before then, I'm going to give you a piece of advice that I wish I had taken when I was your age. 
 Okay. 
 Don't become a bean counter just to please your old man. 
 You'll only grow to resent him, and worse, you'll be unhappy.

 David, your mother and I want to give you a heads up about some of the changes that might be on the horizon. because we love you and because, you know, we want you to be involved in some of the decisions, like, uh... well, whether you should go to a less pricey school, like, uh, I don't know, Montclair State or Bergen Community College... which, by the way, has a solid accounting program. 
 And, uh... where you're going to live in the fall because we're selling the house. 
 Your mother and I are getting a divorce. 
 Well, technically, it's a trial separation. 
 But I think it's going to stick. 
 So we'll sell the house, and your mother will be the listing agent. 
 I told you that we're going to sell, didn't I? 
 Okay. 
 That's all you have to say? 
 No. 
 I don't want to be an accountant. 
 I know. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Give your old man a hand. 
 [ball bounces] 
 Well, I'm going to take a stab and say she's not here to see me. 
 Go on. Go talk to her. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 My father wanted you to have this. 
 He said you earned it. 
 Things must be pretty crazy at your place, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 The house is crawling with lawyers. 
 I had to get out of there. 
 The reason I came is I wanted to clear something up. 
 Okay. 
 I didn't ask you to New York just to piss off my father. 
 No, I, um... I asked you because I think you're funny and... very cute when you're confused, which is a lot of the time. 
 And I thought it would be fun. 
 And it was. 
 Oh, I like you. 
 Ha ha. 
 Which, ah... that is a... very difficult feeling for me to have right now. 
 Why? 
 Because I'm leaving for France. 
 Oh. I thought your dad wasn't letting you go. 
 Yeah. He, uh, he changed his mind. 
 He didn't say, but, if I had to guess, I'd say he just wanted to spare me the whole ordeal of the trial. 
 How long are you going to be gone? 
 A year. 
 Wow. Okay. 
 Ugh. Yeah. 
 I know. 
 That's a long time. 
 Yeah. 
 So, uh, I guess I'll see you when you get back. 
 No.
