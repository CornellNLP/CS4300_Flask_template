 Dude, you got this. 
 It's no big deal. 
 Just be chill. 
 Where do you want me? 
 The light's better over there. 
 Ready? 
 No. 
 But y... yeah. 
 Let's see what we're working with. 
 Keep in mind it's pretty cold. 
 Don't talk. 
 Is... Is something wrong? 
 Did you want me to stand differently or... 
 No. 
 You're perfect. 
 Don't mind me. I'm not looking. 
 Mom, what the hell! 
 I'm just putting in some fresh towels. 
 And here, take this because... 
 Mom, no! 
 With all the sweating in those tennis shorts, you'll get jock itch. Ask your father. 
 Will you please get out of here? 
 Fine. Don't listen to me. 
 They're your genitals. 
 Great. Cool. Great. Okay. 
 Oh, by the way, your father and I are going to therapy, and then he's taking me to the movies, We're gonna see that one with the space people and Wilford Brimley, and it's called Coconuts. 
 Cocoon, Mom, it's called Cocoon. 
 Yes! That's it. 
 That's it. Yeah. Please, get out, please. 
 Okay, I'm going, I'm going. 
 Go. 
 It's not like I haven't seen your pen1s before. 
 I've got to get out of that house. 
 I hear you, man. 
 You and Karen still thinking about getting a place together? 
 She wants to. I don't know. 
 I like her. She was always nice to me in high school, way nicer than any girl that hot has any right to be. 
 You're a lucky guy. 
 I know. She's so nice. 
 And great. 
 And nice. 
 Nice. 
 Yeah. 
 It's great. 
 Finish this for me. I got to go meet that guy. 
 You're really going to do this? 
 Yeah, man. I'm tired of having, like, 12 bucks to my name. 
 And Misty doesn't want to spend the rest of her life with a guy who drives a Matador. 
 Tell Karen I said happy birthday. 
 I will. 
 [engine starts] 
 [honk honk] 
 Okay, here's the drill. 
 When a customer wants to buy some White Pony, he'll roll up, hand you his keys, and ask "Are you the party king?" 
 Gotcha. Uh, White Pony, keys, party king. 
 You okay? 
 Sure. Why? 
 Because you're acting jittery as f*ck. 
 No, I'm cool, man. I got this. 
 I'm your man, honest. 
 I'm counting on you. 
 Now let's talk about the drop. 
 When it's time to resupply... 
 [voice distorted, slow] 
 [no audible dialogue] 
 Hey, Herb. 
 Hey. What's up, kid? 
 Your balls drop yet? 
 Any day now. 
 Ha ha. 
 How did your old man take the news? 
 What news? 
 That you don't want to be a bean counter. 
 Oh, I never said I didn't. 
 I mean, I don't know. I mean, maybe I do. 
 I'm still figuring things out. 
 So you haven't found yourself yet, huh? 
 You know what we did back in my day to find ourselves? 
 No, what? 
 Killed Nazis. 
 Boo. 
 [gasp] Jesus Christ. 
 Oh, my God. Hi. 
 Ah. Oh. What are you doing here? 
 Just came by to wish you a happy birthday and to give you this. 
 That's really sweet of you. 
 You didn't have to do that. 
 I appreciate it, but it's... Oh. 
 Art... Uh, this is yours? 
 My art show. Opening is tonight. 
 Wow. That's really great. Congrats. 
 You should come. 
 It's going to be cheese, vino, art. 
 I would, but David is actually taking me out for my birthday. 
 Oh. You should come by after. 
 And bring him along, unless it's past his bedtime. 
 Stop. 
 I'm incorrigible. 
 So what are your plans for Karen's birthday? 
 Uh, I figured I'd wait and just see what she wants to do. 
 Boychik, do you know nothing of women? 
 What do you mean? 
 Birthdays and anniversaries are not merely special occasions. 
 They're tests, often final exams. 
 Fail to take them seriously, and you know what happens? 
 What? 
 The teacher starts shtupping the other students. 
 She said she didn't want me to go to a lot of trouble. 
 [laughing] Yes, of course. 
 When a woman says that, she means the exact opposite. 
 Trust me, dear boy, she wants you to go to a great deal of trouble, the more the better. 
 Oh, really? Well, I've... I've... 
 Hey, it's okay, David. Don't panic. 
 Now we've still got plenty of time. 
 I'll cover your lessons here this afternoon, and you run to the store. 
 Yeah. 
 W... wait. What am I buying? 
 Flowers, preferably roses. 
 1 dozen long stem. 
 Red only, no pinks or yellows. 
 Why not pink or yellow? 
 Pink implies friendship, and yellow is for pregnant women. 
 Next, purchase these items in the following order: champagne, chocolate, strawberries, condoms. 
 And as for a motel, find something classy. 
 My folks are going to be gone all night, so... 
 Even better. After a nice dinner, when the dessert menu comes, take her by the hand and tell her you have something special planned at the house. 
 She'll set one foot in that door, see the bubbly on ice and the rose petals adorning the bed and spontaneously ovulate, which is why you'll need the condoms. 
 You got all that? 
 Yeah. It's good. 
 Okay. Now get... get going. Get going. 
 Thanks, Nash. 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Are you the party king? 
 Hey, uh, that would be me. 
 I party all the time. 
 Yeah. For half a piece? 
 Cool.

 What's up? 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 Nothing. Why? 
 Uh, do you maybe want to get dinner? 
 Uh, just yeah, you and I? 
 My cousin Pam, she's coming from Ohio. 
 I told her I'd set her up with a really cool guy while she's here. 
 Oh. 
 You know, I thought... 
 Yeah. 
 No, it'll be so much fun. 
 Me and Steve will pay for everything. 
 Oh. Uh, yeah, I don't know because, uh... 
 Come on, Wheeler. I'll be your best friend. 
 Sure. Why not? 
 Oh! Yes. Great. 
 Oh, you're a lifesaver. 
 All right. 
 Ha ha. Thank you. 
 Sam : I don't understand why a grown man can't have a ham sandwich. 
 Judy : Because I want you to live long enough to meet your grandchildren. 
 My father lived till 84 on a diet of Lucky Strikes and brisket. 
 Okay. Did you hear that? 
 Now you see what I'm dealing with. 
 This is exactly... 
 It feels like we've gotten a little off subject. 
 Judy, I'm very interested in something you said at an earlier session about how you sometimes don't know who you are. 
 Oh. Well, that's true. 
 You know, I know that I'm Mrs. Myers. 
 I know that I am the wife of Sam. 
 I am mother of David. 
 But when I try to find... look down and see what's underneath, it's just, uh... it's just... blank. 
 You feel there's an empty place where a person should be. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 How long have you felt this way? 
 Well, for a long time. 
 I mean, Sam and I, we married young. 
 I... You know, we married right when I graduated secretarial school, and, you know, I was a housewife when everyone else was going to happenings, going backpacking through Europe, to having s*x with strangers. 
 Oh, for God's sake. 
 So you feel like you've missed out on a lot. 
 I have never even been out of the United States. 
 What, are you kidding? 
 We've been to both sides of Niagara Falls.

 I don't get it. So you're blaming me because you didn't go to Woodstock, you didn't get to be a hippie? 
 Have you heard a word I've said? 
 Have you heard anything I've said? 
 You know what? This is pointless. 
 I don't even know why I bother because it is clearly a waste of everyone's time. 
 Judy, please. 
 No, I don't want to sit. 
 Please, sit. 
 Thank you. 
 Judy, Sam, what you're experiencing is not uncommon. 
 Sometimes in marriage, we misplace our connectedness. 
 And just need a little nudge to find it again. 
 I don't know what you people are talking about. 
 Oh. Of course he doesn't. 
 A lot of our couples have found the connectedness they misplaced along the way with the help of something called MDMA. 
 It's short for methylenedioxy methamphetamine. 
 Just think of it as empathy medicine. 
 What does it do? 
 Well, Judy, it breaks down the walls of anger and defensiveness and increases trust and compassion. 
 Drugs. 
 Hush, Sam. 
 Drugs. No, I just want to get this straight. 
 They're doctors. 
 Listen, they sound like dope peddlers. 
 I... I understand your concerns, but let me be perfectly clear. 
 MDMA is used for therapy only. 
 It's perfectly legal, non-addictive, and never used recreationally. 
 Sam, I was skeptical, too, at first, until I tried it myself. 
 What, you've done it? 
 Yes, Judy. Some years back, Kenda and I went through a rough patch after I slept with an old high school flame. 
 And it was MDMA that helped us find our way back to each other. 
 [chuckling] 
 Thank God. Sam, relax. 
 You're going to enjoy it, I promise. 
 Takes about 45 minutes for it to kick in. 
 But don't take them now. 
 Wait until you're in a safe place where you can be fully present for one another. 
 I can't believe we're doing this.

 Oh, yeah? 
 My dad ran over our dog in the driveway. 
 Oh. 
 That's, um... awful. 
 I'm really sorry.

 Would have been better if he ran over my older brother.
