 (man coughs) 
 Hi. 
 Not really sure how this works. 
 Why don't you tell me how long it's been since your last confession? 
 Uh, never. 
 Never? 
 Nope, I'm Jewish. 
 But I've always wondered what goes on inside these things. 
 Wouldn't you be more comfortable speaking to your rabbi? 
 Nah. 
 I don't really trust guys with beards. 
 I'm sorry, you don't have a beard, do you? 
 No. 
 Okay, good. 
 Um... 
 Is there something troubling you that I can help you with? 
 Hmm. 
 How long you got? 
 I mean, is there something weighing on your conscience you'd like to confess? 
 To confess? 
 Well... 
 Uh, I cheated at tennis last week. 
 But it was kind of on the line, could have gone either way. 
 And, uh... 
 I lied to my wife. 
 I told her we were out of gin. 
 I poured it down the kitchen sink. 
 Anything else? 
 Well... 
 If you were to ask our state's attorney, he'd say I'm guilty of financial crimes, but the guy is such an asshole... 
 Sorry, pardon my language. 
 And are you? Guilty? 
 What, did I do anything that half of Wall Street isn't out there right now doing? f*ck, no. 
 Sorry, again. The language. 
 We'll tally up the profanity and deal with it at the end. 
 Okay, that seems fair. 
 Uh... 
 I like it here. Nice. 
 Smells like cinnamon. 
 (chuckles) 
 Some parishes are doing away with confessionals. 
 Why? 
 The feeling is that modern Catholics would prefer to see their confessor face to face. 
 See, that's what's wrong with the world. 
 Nobody can leave well enough alone. 
 You know, as soon as you got everything figured out, you're going along pretty good, then the rules change. 
 There's one thing that doesn't change. 
 What? 
 God's love for us. 
 Yeah, well, I don't really believe in God. 
 But, I mean, no offense. 
 He believes in you. 
 Okay, well... 
 Tell him I could use his help. 
 Actually, I should get back. 
 I don't want to be late for my own trial. 
 Go in peace. 
 Thank you. I'm not sure how this works. 
 There's a collection box outside. 
 Consider it the swear jar. 
 (chuckles) 
 Fair enough. 
 Thank you. 
 It was good talking to you, Padre. 
 You, too. 
 Phew. 
 Good morning, my beloved. 
 What are you doing? 
 Merely watching you sleep. 
 Not in any creepy or obsessive way, of course. 
 Am I that interesting? 
 Riveting. 
 If you were on television, I would watch you every week. 
 Then way you breathe in... and then out. 
 Well, I have had a lot of practice. 
 (chuckles) 
 You are a delight. 
 I've never seen a house with so many mirrors. 
 Thank you for a wonderful evening. 
 Oh, my darling, I should be thanking you. 
 I'm... I'm sorry we didn't... 
 Hush. Don't apologize, my dear. 
 I'm happy to just spoon. 
 We have our whole lives to f*ck. 
 (laughs) 
 I'll see you soon. 
 (murmuring) 
 All rise. 
 (man clears throat) 
 Mmm. 
 How could you mess up a screwdriver? 
 It's only two ingredients. 
 Sorry, Herb. 
 Just get me a vodka and prune juice. 
 What's that called? 
 A Russian enema. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing tonight? 
 Uh, I don't know. Why? 
 I checked with my parents, and they said it was okay if you came over to give me a private lesson. 
 Oh. 
 Is six cool for you? 
 Um... 
 Great. See you then, Okay. 
 Jail time. 
 At this time, we will recess for lunch. 
 Court will resume in exactly one hour. 
 (dialogue inaudible) 
 Why aren't you at the club? 
 I didn't have any lessons this morning, and I figured he could use the moral support. 
 f*cking trial. 
 What a farce. 
 Can you believe that state's attorney? 
 Looks like a f*cking lounge act with that comb-over. 
 That's the real crime. 
 Hey. 
 Hello. 
 Here's your mail. 
 Why the post office can't understand that we don't live together anymore is beyond me. 
 Hmm. 
 So, how've you been? 
 Fine. 
 You sure? 
 What's that mean? 
 David is worried about you. 
 No, he's not. 
 At his age, they're not capable of thinking about anybody but themselves. 
 Mmm, not our David. 
 Yes, our David, and it's fine. 
 He should be worried about himself instead of drifting along aimlessly. 
 I know. 
 That's the thing with their generation. 
 You know, they don't want careers, they want callings. 
 Not enough to get a paycheck. 
 Maybe. 
 You know what it is? 
 They never fought a war. 
 Oh, God, Sam, don't even say that. 
 No, you know what I mean. 
 When I came back from Korea, I was happy just to have a job where nobody was shooting at me. 
 Move into a house with five guys, we ate ketchup sandwiches. 
 Didn't talk about job satisfaction, we talked about sports or girls. 
 Do you think we should sit him down and have a talk with him? 
 I don't know. 
 He's not a kid anymore, he's 21 years old. 
 He'll always be my baby. 
 What is that? 
 Pastrami on rye. 
 Sam! 
 Take it easy, it's tuna salad. 
 We got married near here. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 City clerk's office, fourth street. 
 A block that way. 
 My father wasn't about to pay for any big wedding, or any wedding, for that matter. 
 So, we jumped on the C-train, and came down here, brought my friend Brenda as a witness. 
 (chuckles) 
 We didn't have a pot to piss in back then. 
 You know how big our first place was? 
 280 square feet. 
 Seriously? 
 Yeah, it was a dump. 
 Had more mice than windows. 
 But we didn't care. 
 We just wanted to be together. 
 I could do it again if I had to. 
 But he can't. 
 That man loves what he does. 
 Let those M*therf*ckers take that away from him, it will kill him. 
 What do you say, gorgeous? 
 Come on, let's go grab a little lunch. 
 Where are we going? 
 Jerry knows a great Italian joint, right around the corner. 
 You want to join us? 
 Oh, thanks, but I have some stuff I need to do. 
 Okay. 
 Bye, David. 
 Bye. 
 Nobody pushes a button? 
 Hi-ya, Sam. 
 Harry. 
 Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, any luck finding that Soon Hi? 
 No. 
 No, the guy at the Korean embassy said the chances of finding somebody with the last name Lee are about one in a million. 
 Actually, 40 million because that's how many South Koreans there are. 
 Well, therein lies your problem, Sam. 
 You're searching in the wrong country. 
 What? 
 She's not in Korea, she's here in the states. 
 What? 
 I got in touch with a friend of mine at INS. 
 He tells me she immigrated here in 1963. 
 Four years later, she became a naturalized citizen. 
 You're kidding me? 
 You're sure it's her? 
 Only one way to find out. 
 What's that? 
 Her last known address. 
 I think she's right outside of Scranton. 
 (laughs) 
 All these years, she's living two hours away from me. 
 (laughing) 
 Happy hunting, brother. 
 Jane is a blank student. She studies for hours before every test. 
 The answer is a, meticulous, b, relaxed, c, lackadaisical, d, apathetic, or e, lethargic. 
 Oh. 
 Was that your leg? Sorry. 
 You're totally blushing. 
 No, I'm not, it's just... it's really hot in here. 
 What's going on in here, you two? 
 Nothing, Mr. Collins. We're just going over some vocab because there's vocab on the test. 
 It really trips people up if they don't know they're, um... 
 How much am I paying you an hour? 
 Daddy! 
 Just kidding! Mom and I won't be out too late. 
 I left some money on the credenza if you want to get pizza. 
 Sadly, her mother and I are having dinner with the neighbors. 
 Anybody here had s*x? 
 Just me? 
 That's odd. 
 (chairs moving) 
 Talk to you later. Yep. 
 I'm not much of a cuddler after s*x. 
 I'm good for maybe, like, one hug and then I'm like, "Could you get me a water? 
 You know, from the 7-11 across town?" 
 (laughing) 
 While you're there, just get an application, take the job, work there for about a year, come back, then maybe I'll be ready to cuddle again. 
 (laughing) 
 I like s*x. It's the dating part I'm not good at, you know? 
 Everybody asks the same questions, like, "What school did you go to?" 
 "What year did you graduate?" 
 "How long has that sore been on your lip?" 
 (laughs) 
 Can I get a little help? 
 How long do we have to stay? 
 Will you please stop being a grump? 
 I'm not being a grump, I'm just beat. 
 I've had a long week. 
 How do you think I feel? I'm coming off a double shift. 
 Yeah, so wouldn't you rather go to your apartment and rent a movie or something? 
 We can stay in anytime. 
 And we're here to support Zan. 
 Zan doesn't like me. 
 Zan doesn't like anyone. 
 So you admit it? 
 Oh, here it is. 
 What's wrong? 
 We hardly ever get to see each other anymore. 
 So I was looking forward to it just being us tonight. 
 One hour. 
 Okay? 
 And then you can have me all to yourself. 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 Here we go. 
 Mmm. 
 What is this? 
 Schnapps and Dr. Pepper. 
 I figured I'd better use one of the bottles from the back of the liquor cabinet so my folks wouldn't notice. 
 I can't let you drink this, Tabitha. 
 Why not? 
 Because you're underage which means your brain is still developing. 
 And because Hitler drank Schnapps. 
 Let's not talk about Hitler. 
 Whoa, whoa, Tabitha. Wait. 
 What's wrong? 
 We can't, I'm your teacher. You're 17 years old. 
 Only until next month. 
 Even so, it just wouldn't be right. 
 It's not what your father's paying me for. 
 I guess you're right. 
 I'm sorry, Tabitha. You're a great girl. 
 I just... 
 What the f*ck? 
 Eli, what are you doing here? 
 That's my girlfriend! 
 Ex-girlfriend. 
 Yeah, I'm still in love with you. 
 Well, you should have thought of that before you fingered Cindy Chang. 
 I'm just going to let myself out. 
 (shouts) 
 Stop! Eli! 
 You were so great. 
 The crowd sucked. 
 Oh, really? I didn't think so. 
 They were laughing. I was laughing. 
 I mean, what? 
 I guess some of it worked okay. 
 My diaphragm bit always kills. 
 Oh, that was so funny! 
 Oh, and I also loved that joke about the birthmark of Gorbachev's head. 
 I'm always confused, do you call them jokes or bits or... 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 You just surprise me. 
 My father's trial was supposed to start today. 
 Yeah. 
 My mother's been leaving messages on my machine all week trying to get me to come. 
 But I figured, why? 
 It's not like there's anything I can do. 
 It's... it's really something, isn't it? 
 It's all toilets. 
 It really makes you consider this everyday object we take for granted as, like, domestic sculpture. 
 Hey, kids. 
 Zan! 
 This is Simon and Adelaide. 
 Adelaide teaches life drawing at the new school. 
 And this is Skye, we work together. 
 Hello. 
 Hi, and this is my boyfriend, David. 
 Zan, your installation is amazing. 
 It takes Duchamp's Fountain to a whole 'nother level. 
 Thanks. 
 You shoot it on Standard or Super 16? 
 Super 8, actually. 
 Are you a filmmaker, too? 
 Aspiring, I guess. 
 I was going to go to NYU, but it didn't work out. 
 Oh, you're lucky. Those are four years you would never get back. 
 Oh, you didn't go to film school? 
 God, no. Brown. 
 What was your major? 
 Semiotics. 
 Does your film have a title? 
 Crapper. 
 Fitting. 
 To be honest, it's not what I would have chosen for tonight. 
 It's not really representative of my recent work. 
 Hey, does anyone feel like joining me for a little... 
 No, thanks. 
 I just took a cat valium. 
 Kids? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I will. 
 Excuse us gals while we go powder our noses. 
 (laughs) 
 I just think you two would really hit it off if you had a chance to get to know each other. 
 I mean... 
 Uh-huh. 
 David is super into film. 
 Especially French New Wave. 
 He's obsessed with Erich Rohmer. 
 Of course he is. 
 He's just in a bad mood tonight for some reason. 
 Look, Skye, you don't have to defend him to me. 
 All right, I get it. There's comfort in the familiar. 
 I didn't break up with my high school boyfriend until... junior year of college. 
 David isn't my high school boyfriend. 
 Oh. 
 I mean, we've only been dating for, like, a year. 
 Hi. 
 I'm starving, want to go over to sixth street and get some Indian food? 
 No, I don't want to eat, I want to dance. 
 Come on, come on, dance with me. 
 It'll cheer you up. 
 I don't need cheering up. 
 Why are you being so lame tonight? 
 I'm not being lame, this place is lame. 
 I don't get it, I thought you'd be inspired. 
 What, by a bunch of pretentious posers and a movie about toilets? 
 I think you need to be a little more open-minded. 
 Come on, where's that sexy break-dancer I used to know. 
 Wishing he was somewhere else. 
 Fine. 
 We can go? 
 You can. 
 I'm staying. I'm having fun. 
 Well, will you be okay getting home by yourself? 
 Of course, just go. Excuse me. 
 Gingivitis can progress to periodontitis which can lead to bone resorption and eventually, tooth loss. 
 Are you all right? 
 Oh my God. 
 What happened? 
 I got beat up. 
 By who? 
 That kid, Eli. 
 What, your student? 
 Okay, let me take a look. 
 Is it bad, doc? 
 Okay, change of plans, gang. 
 Instead of gum inflammation we're going to jump ahead to emergency dentistry. 
 Misty, prep a chair. 
 All right. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was just dropping off a box of cat toys to your dad, but I didn't want to wake him, so I was going to leave them. 
 Oh, cool. 
 Late night snack? 
 Oh, yeah, I was at this stupid art opening in the city and there wasn't any food. So... 
 Do you remember that time senior year when we cut class and we just drove to Asbury Park and we sat on the beach and ate KFC? 
 And it was super windy. 
 And then the seagull, like, stole the chicken wing? 
 Yeah, which, if you think about it is just wrong. 
 Totally gross. 
 Cannibals. 
 Uh... 
 You hungry? 
 Me? Um... 
 I mean, you know, it's not like I'm going to eat all this by myself. 
 Well, what about your dad? 
 His cardiologist doesn't want him eating fried food. 
 (chuckles) 
 You know what? Why not? 
 Okay. 
 It's not just about capturing form. 
 Mmm. 
 Or reproducing the real. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm trying to invite the spectator into the work. 
 Right, of course you are. 
 Start a dialogue. 
 Skye, where do you keep the corkscrew? 
 Uh, it's, um, on the counter. 
 By the sink. 
 Technically, you're very proficient. 
 That's not the problem. 
 Oh? 
 Yeah, the problem is a lack of point of view. 
 Something to say. 
 Like I tell my students, perspective, voice. 
 Call it what you want, it's missing. 
 You can feel it. 
 There's this emptiness to your work. 
 They're like, uh... 
 Cadavers. 
 Which, don't get me wrong, can actually be quite beautiful. 
 But, these aren't. 
 Uh, okay. 
 (sobbing) 
 How are things with Skye? 
 Complicated. 
 Sorry. 
 No, I mean, good complicated. 
 For the most part. 
 We just had a fight. 
 Not really a fight so much as a disagreement. 
 Never going to be able to fit into my wedding dress. 
 You still have a month to Jazzercise it off. 
 Please don't remind me. 
 You nervous? 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 Actually, if I'm being honest, I'm kind of freaking out. 
 Why? 
 I don't know, just... 
 Getting married's like, a really huge deal. 
 You know, there's lot of decisions, like, do I want roses or tulips? 
 Chocolate cake or vanilla butter cream? 
 And then there's the big one. 
 "Do you take this man?" 
 How am I supposed to answer that? 
 I'm pretty sure you're supposed to say "I do." 
 But do I? 
 I mean, I do, now that I think, but... 
 How do I know I'll feel the same when I get older? 
 'Til death do you part is a really long time. 
 It's overwhelming. 
 It's weird to think how much less complicated life used to be. 
 Not even that long ago. 
 I know. 
 I kind of miss it sometimes. 
 Me, too. 
 Thanks, again. 
 Sorry, I didn't know where else to go. 
 No, it's okay. 
 It was so scary, Misty. 
 I remember thinking, like, whoa, dude, this is how it ends. 
 And then, who's gonna remind Nana to take her pills? 
 You're a good guy, Wheeler. 
 Yeah, after this, I'm swearing off women. 
 Maybe just underage ones? 
 Yeah, but they're the only ones who are interested in me. 
 That's not true. 
 All right. 
 That was a mistake. 
 It was. 
 I mean, what were we thinking? 
 We weren't, that's the problem. 
 I'm a terrible person. 
 No, you're not, this is my fault, not yours. 
 No, I kissed you first. 
 Yeah, I didn't exactly stop you. 
 How could I even do this to Barry? 
 I mean, he's so good to me and he loves me so much. 
 He really does. 
 I just keep thinking that maybe I did this on purpose, you know? 
 Like maybe I secretly wanted this to happen. 
 Why? 
 So I could have an excuse not to marry Barry. 
 You don't need an excuse, Karen. 
 Do you love him? 
 Yeah. 
 I really do. 
 But that's what's so confusing. 
 (door opens) 
 Oh. Heya, kids. 
 Hi, Mr. Meyers. I'm really sorry, we didn't mean to wake you. 
 Oh, no, no, don't be silly. 
 It's good to see you. 
 I am looking forward to your wedding. 
 Won't be long now. 
 I know. 
 I'm gonna get going, 'cause it's late. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, I almost forgot. 
 Um, well, Barry and I were wondering if you would consider maybe videoing the wedding for us? 
 Wouldn't that be kind of awkward? 
 Not for me. 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 A sweet girl. 
 Nice you two could remain friends. 
 Yeah. 
 One wing won't kill you. Go ahead, I won't tell Mom. 
 Oh, Mother of God.
