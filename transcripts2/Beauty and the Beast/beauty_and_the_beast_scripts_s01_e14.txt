 Catherine :  Nine years ago, I witnessed my mother's murder. 
 I would have been killed, too, if it hadn't been for Vincent. Vincent :  I was part of an experimental special forces group. Their goal was to create the perfect super soldier. But something went wrong. You're him. If that cop had booked you, Muirfield would have been here before the ink dried. There's a secret organization that's obsessed with the same creature you've been studying. You'll join us. After this conversation, I get a sense I'm either with you or I'm dead. I'd like you to meet my brother. This is Darius. Dinner? You know if I could be with you, I would, right? While I'm standing here waiting to hear the amazing reason you're destroying evidence. I'll put in for a new partner in the morning. Catherine :  Turns out you can't control your heart. Damn thing just does what it wants. Heather : Oh, my God. Okay, this is bad. It's going to be fine. Okay, you don't... you don't understand. My sister sees me kiss a guy, she Googles him down to his high school yearbook. Maybe she didn't get a good look at me. No, the lights were on. She totally saw you. Vincent, Alex saw you, and we had to put her on a bus to get her away from Muirfield. She had to give up her entire life. I don't... I don't want that for my sister. Catherine, Alex was part of my old life. Okay, Heather knows nothing about me. Okay. It's not like she's ever seen you before. Right. I could just be some random guy you picked up at a bar. I'm sure that's happened before. Yeah, all the time. Yeah. Random guy. Never seen me before. Never see you again. Except you probably will-- later. But right now, you should probably, uh, go deal, yeah? Yeah. Uh, rain check. Bye. Heather? Heath'? Hi. I am so sorry. Hi. I am so sorry. No, no, no, it's okay. I was just so excited about my date, and I... Oh, right, with Joe's brother. How'd it go? Forget about my date. Who was that guy? That? That was just some random guy I met at a bar. (chuckles) Some random guy? Yeah. Thank God you came out when you did. Before I, uh, did anything stupid. Catherine? That was Vincent Zalanksi, wasn't it? The-the guy that you took to Dad's wedding? I didn't bring anyone to Dad's wedding, remember? No, I know. It's just, I saw you dancing with some guy that looked a lot like him. He's Ass, isn't he? Who? (laughs) Ass-- the guy with all of the issues, the guy that ran back to his ex, the one that you swore you would move on from. No wonder why you're trying to hide him. You know, we're just... we're still navigating, you know, where we are exactly. Seemed like you knew where you were about 30 minutes ago. You should invite him to Joe's award thingy. With all of my work people? Uh-huh. No, and you're going to be working the entire time. You're not even going to be able to talk to him at all. Well, I am an assistant event planner, not a cater waiter. Once the party's going, I'll totally have time to hang out. Okay, he's just... he's not great in crowds. Then have him over for dinner. Heather. I'm not going to grill him. No, Catherine, I just want to meet him. All right, a lot of people bring their boyfriends over to meet the family. That's what normal sisters do. I just... I feel like you're sneaking around on me. Heath'. No, okay, look, listen, I... I am on your side. If you like this guy, I want to like him, too. I just don't want you to lie to me. Okay. Okay, I will ask him. Okay. Okay, what happened to "I'm some random guy"? She recognized you from the wedding. She thinks you're Vincent Zalanski, this mysterious "Ass." Ass? Yeah, and the more of a mystery you are, the more suspicious she gets. But if you come over for dinner, then you'll become less mysterious. It will normalize you, and then maybe she'll stop digging and-and we can keep her off Muirfield's radar. Why don't you just tell her that this Zalanski is some ass who blew you off and disappeared into the black hole of New York City? Because it's a lie. Vincent, I have two... two important relationships in my life besides you. And I already lost Tess. She filed for a new partner. I just... I don't think I can lose my sister, too. So, what, sharing a slice is gonna alleviate all sisterly suspicion? Yes... and from then on, you can be this nice E.R. doc who gets to hang out  in  my apartment. Somewhere without razor wire surrounding it. Maybe some walls. Mm-hmm. A door we can close. A door would be nice. (door closes) JT : Catherine. What's up with your buddy Evan? (laughing) Did I walk in on something? Oh, no, just a delivery order. So, Evan-- I haven't heard from him in a couple of days. His morgue was bugged by Muirfield. I'm a tad worried. I wouldn't worry. I saw Evan last night, and I think he probably just hasn't called 'cause he got dumped. Um, I'll see you tonight? Yes. (clears throat) Law enforcement personnel only. Actually, I'm Dr. Sorenson. I work with your girlfriend, Claire. I think we can all stop pretending she was ever my girlfriend. You got onto something that's of interest to us. Apologies if it affected your personal relationship. I've moved on. Attacking me in the middle of a police station is probably ill-advised. (chuckles) Seems like your non-girlfriend gave you the wrong impression about us. Remarkable. What you have figured out on your own-- cross-species DNA sequencing-- that took our people years. You would be an asset to our organization. You make it sound like I have a choice. Of course you have a choice. You think we want people working for us who don't believe in our cause? What cause? To cover up this creature you've created? Dr. Marks, you obviously got into this line of work to put away monsters. This creature is dangerous. It needs to be contained. But the choice is yours. (knocking) I'll get it. What are you wearing? I thought we said casual. This is festive-casual. No, this outfit is serious pressure. I don't want him to feel like this is a big deal. Well, he should feel like it's a big deal. I mean, he's meeting your sister. (quietly): It's festive-casual. (knocking) (sighing): Okay. Hi. It sounds like I'm underdressed. No, no, you're perfect. It's just the three of us. It's a safe, controlled environment. Heather : Hello. Okay. Heather, this is Vincent. Hello. Hi. Hi. He brought flowers. Oh. Here. Thank you. So, Vincent, I've heard so much about you. Oh, yeah, I hope, uh, not all bad. Just that he's a doctor and... And there's still so much more I want to know. Oh, I'm an open book. Maybe we should let Vincent eat before we give him the third degree. No, she-she can ask me now. Oh, really? So, why'd you run out when I walked in on you two the other night? Uh, because Catherine was nervous of me meeting her only sister. Right. Yeah. So, how'd you guys meet? Well, we were... I asked him. Outside a bar. What bar? Heather. And I looked into her eyes... And you just knew? Yeah. So, then, why did you go back to your ex? Uh, because I'm a complete idiot. Who was... afraid of the incredibly intense feelings he has for your sister. Yeah. Okay. (laughs) Um, I'm going to go put these in a really nice vase. (sighs) (knocking) Heather : Ooh, I'll get it! I thought we were the only ones. Maybe the delivery guy forgot something? Delivery guy is wearing, uh, a lot of cologne. Hey, you made it. I hope I'm not too late. No, no, you're perfect. Come on in. So, you guys, this is Darius. You know, Joe's brother. Darius : How you doing? Uh, yeah, great. (clears throat) Isn't this fun? Yeah, it's great. ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x14 ♪ Tough Love 
Original Air Date on February 21, 2013 I just mentioned it to Darius in passing. I wasn't even sure if he'd show. Oh, really? Festive-casual. (scoffs) Okay, fine. You know what? Whatever. Unlike you, I actually want you to meet the guy that I like. And I don't see what the problem is. I mean, we have plenty of food. No, I promised Vincent it would just be the three of us. And he just said that he has intense feelings for you. And besides, doesn't it look like they're getting along? Wow, so a club promoter. Uh, so, uh, what club? Wednesday night at Paint, and Thursday over at Dubstep. I've heard of them. Good. That means I'm doing my job. You know what? You should text me sometime, huh? Hook you up with VIP. That sounds cool. I will check it out. Cool. Uh, Heather says you're a doctor. What hospital do you work at? Actually, uh, he's in between right now. Oh, I thought you just said... I actually just got a new job, and I haven't told you yet. Oh, you should've told me... Yeah. ...honey. Dinner? Mmm. That's good. (phone buzzing) Yeah. One second. ♪ (amplified heartbeat) Darius : ...companies begging me just to use their brand. These sponsors, they give you free swag, and they act like you owe them something. Catherine : Don't you? I just... I mean, nothing's free. You always have to give something back. Cat... No, that's cool. My brother's a cop, too. Vincent, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, he's fine. You're fine, right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know what, Vinnie? You should give me your card. My line of work, I could use a doctor on call. Fight breaks out... No, actually, I think he's pretty busy with work. Mm-hmm. I mean, I gather. Oh, yeah. I only ask because, you know, you look like you can take care of yourself. That's a pretty serious cut you got on your face. Yeah, how did you, um... It was a fight. Accident. It was an accident. Fight. (laughter) Uh, more wine? Heather : Oh. (laughs) How did you do that? I am such a klutz. (laughs) Uh, Darius, Heather says that Dubstep is amazing. Yeah, we totally have to go. And I know you two like to dance, so... The pictures from Dad's wedding-- you guys are on the dance floor. There is a picture of us? Mm-hmm. Well, Cat's back is to the camera, but it's definitely you, Vincent. Actually, the proofs are in my room. Yeah. Actually, would you excuse me? I just got to, uh, check in at the hospital. Yeah. Um, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned the scar? No, no. You know, it's just... meeting family for the first time, it's always kind of... Hey. I, uh... I was just gonna grab those photos for Catherine to look at. So you were gonna go into my bedroom? Y-Yeah, I... I should've asked first. (scoffs) You know what? You might be this sweet talker and you got me flowers and all, but I think my first instincts about you were right. And I don't trust you. I... I'm sorry. Yeah. Me, too. Thank you. You're welcome. You know what, I got to take off. Something at the hospital. But, uh, nice to meet you and thank you for dinner. No, I'll-I'll walk you out. Here. Thanks. (both sigh) I am so sorry. I know that was awkward. Yeah. We got to get that photograph. Yes, I know. That's the first I heard about it. I'll get it. Trust me. I actually already tried, but your sister caught me at her door. We cannot risk having any more people know about me. Yeah, I didn't know that Darius was gonna be here, obviously. Um... But I think it's okay. He's Joe's brother. He's a good guy. No, he is hiding something. Well, you're hiding something, and you're a good guy. Okay, it didn't go according to plan. No. But I think it was just a normal, awkward, family dinner. I don't know. Because of this, you can come in the front door tomorrow. Mmm, better check that with your sister first. Yes, I will talk to her. She'll be fine. And then we can hang out in my room without whispering. We're whispering now. That's because we're not alone. Heather : Is everything okay? All good! (laughs) See? Normal. Hmm. Yeah. Photo. Yes. Of course. Bye. Hey. Do you think we could talk? I would love that. Let's go in the interrogation room. Or I could buy you a cinnamon dolce latte across the street. Actually, um... Is it a case? Well, come on. I'll fill you in. Okay. Hey. What's going on? We need to talk about Vincent Zalanski. Uh, what about him? He doesn't exist. A lot of people aren't on Google. Yeah, but they're on the Social Security database, or NCIC or DMV, or registered as a doctor. Maybe he changed his name. Cat, you're a cop. Why do people do that? Because he's hiding from the law. He's definitely not hiding from the law. Really, Cat? Because last night I caught him snooping around my bedroom like he was about to steal something. Okay, what is this? Is this some sort of intervention? Good cop, bad cop? No, try friend and family, and you're lucky I'm even here. I've been this close to writing you off. Tess, I am sorry that I haven't been very open with you, but that's going to change. Heather saw Vincent at dinner, and okay, he was awkward, but... He was more than awkward. He obviously didn't want to be there, and you weren't yourself. You spent the whole night talking for him. You weren't even there. Okay, you know, it's called, um... it's called hyper-vigilance, and it's a red flag. A "red flag"? That you're in an emotionally toxic relationship. Okay, I am not. Heather : And you're covering for him. I mean, how did he really get that scar? It was a fight after a motorcycle accident. Trust me, okay? This... this is a misunderstanding. First of all, we can't trust you anymore. And second, there's no misunderstanding this guy's clearly had a bad effect on you. You disappear during work hours, you lie about who you're with, not to mention, I caught you tampering with evidence. It's like you're a completely different person I am not. What about you guys? It's not like either of you are in the most functional relationships. Cat, this is about our relationship with you. Okay, what? You want me to choose? Between you and him? Tess : You know what? Yes, or I start reporting what you've done. 
 
 Joe : Hey. What's going on in here? Girl talk. That mean you two are partners again? Depends on Cat. We're working it out. (phone vibrates) (Joe clears throat) I was just here, um, getting feedback for the centerpieces for your big shindig tonight, so, um, I-I'll see you later. And, uh, I've got to go and see if something came in for us. She doesn't know. That's not what your thing is about with her? You and me? No, I would never. (sighs) About tonight... Miranda's coming. What happened to the business trip? I don't know. I-I guess she's trying. Oh, okay, so after years of ignoring you, she senses you pulling away, so she shows up? Tess, I am going to talk to her after the party. I'm ready to leave her. Don't do it for me. You should do what feels right. My marriage doesn't feel right. Neither does an award for leadership or integrity. You know, Clinton was one of my favorite presidents. You are so not helping. Oh, come on. Tess and Heather gave me an ultimatum-- you or them. Catherine, the photograph... I got it, and if she notices it's missing, I'll just tell her that I wanted it. Okay, that's great, but... Not exactly. Um, you made Heather so suspicious that she and Tess ran your name through Social Security. So now JT's gonna have to hack into the database and add it in. Catherine, your sister, she posted those photos online, including the one of me. Okay, um, I'll tell her to take it down. JT's already deleted it, but if Muirfield are running facial recognition scans, they may trace it back to her computer. Oh, my God. If something bad happens to her because I wanted some kind of normal... She just got the proofs, okay? That means it was only up for a short window of time. But if she made a scan, then there must be a digital copy somewhere. Okay, I'll get it, but we have to keep Okay. an eye on her just to be safe. We will. Okay. Heather : Okay, so let's just take care of that. Hey. Hi. You got a minute? Um, uh, yeah, sure. I saw you posted those pictures online. Yeah, people might want copies. I looked for the flash drive everywhere. I couldn't find it. Because it's in my bag. Could I get it? Why? Okay. Heather, Vincent, he he can't have his picture posted anywhere. Why? Because he's a criminal? No, he's not a criminal. Heather, okay, I... I need you to trust me on this, all right? Vincent, he's... he's dealing with certain things, and... and I love you, and I can't have you involved in them. So I need you to give me the flash drive and promise me that you will never post his picture again. Oh, my God, you're... you're picking him over us. I don't understand why I have to pick. Heather, I invited him to dinner because I thought you were on my side. I am. It doesn't feel like it. One awkward double date, and you decide that he's a criminal. You show up at my workplace, you talk to my coworker, you interrogate me in my interrogation room... Because I can't just stand by and let you ruin your life. I am not ruining my life. I'm the responsible one, remember? Whenever you're in trouble, who do you come running to? Yeah. That's right. I talk to you. Because that's what normal siblings do, but you just... you don't know how to be normal, do you? God. Heather! Heather. (sighs) You know what? You say you don't want to choose, but I think you just did, so here. You got your photo back, but Vincent Zalanski just cost you your roommate. Heather, wait! (sighs) So, how's it feel to be the finest of New York's finest? Um, you got to tell me. (laughs) I read all about your club-- top ten New York hot spots. Yeah, but I'm not protecting and serving. Oh, no, no, you're serving, and you are driving a Porsche. Meanwhile, big brother driving a squad car. So, who's the family jerk now? You still. Seriously, though, I am so damn proud of you. Thanks, man. Joe : Uh-oh. Here comes your new girlfriend. No drama in my precinct. Hey. You think it's a bad idea to drink on the job? You're asking a guy who works in a club? Clearly, I'm looking for a yes. Hey, you okay? Uh... no. (laughs) You want to get out of here? Okay. You ever driven one of these before? (laughs) No. Why? You want to? After you. (laughing): What? (crowd chatter) Hey. Uh, so, I know Heather probably told you that I picked; I didn't pick. I don't know why I have to. Wait. You picked? Heather didn't tell you about our fight? I haven't seen Heather. Oh. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. You give me a do-over, we become partners again. You see that I am fine, and you tell Heather that I'm.... I'm not giving you a do-over with fake-named Vincent in the picture. Vincent's not actually a fake name. Oh, whatever. You are so much prettier than she is. Still no do-over. (sighs) God, where... where is Heather? I'm checking every security camera in the precinct. Tell me I'm being paranoid. Vincent : You said you had a fight. I mean, maybe that's why she's not answering. I know, but I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on her, and what if...? What if you're right? What if Muirfield traced your picture to her computer? Maybe  I  was being paranoid. Okay. Okay, she's with Darius. See? But you said he was a liar. I thought we were worrying about Muirfield. We were. Ok, hang on. A black SUV followed them. Okay, you got plates? No, I can't make them out. If-if anything happens to her, I will never forgive myself. Okay, we'll find her. We're just gonna track her phone. Okay. 212-555-0180. I need to talk to you about, uh, that creature. Okay, I got to call you back. I have a decision to make-- an opportunity, actually-- but it would come at a cost. And I'm trying to figure out if it'd be worth it. What kind of opportunity? A way to hunt this thing? Evan, let this go. Look, I know that you know this thing exists. That bike messenger that you said that you killed in self-defense had cross-species DNA all over him. And your car crash. I saw someone, some thing pull you out of that wreckage. Okay, I... I want to talk about this, I do, but it's not a good time. Look, I just... Look, just tell me why you won't pursue it. Because I'm not a scientist. No. You're a homicide detective, and this thing kills people. Criminals. It kills criminals. There you go again, protecting it. Evan, I'm sorry. (loud club music playing, crowd chatter) (whooping, cheering and whistling) Heather! Cat? What are you doing here? Heather. Why aren't you answering your phone? What? Your phone-- you weren't answering it. I'm mad at you, remember? And I can't hear it. Okay, where's Darius? He's at the bar getting drinks. Why? What's going on? Okay, when I... when I couldn't find you, I checked security footage. There were guys following you. In a black SUV? Yeah, those are Darius's friends. (sighs) (laughs) Oh, my God. Why? What did you think? No, it doesn't matter. I... I love you, and I don't want you to move out. Okay, I-I don't, either, Cat, but... What about Vincent Zalanski? I don't feel safe around him. All right, maybe I overstepped, surprising you at work. I... No, you were worried about me. I get it. Just, looking for you today, I... I never want to feel that way again. I will... I will break up with Vincent Zalanski. We can burn his photo together. I'm done. Good, 'cause he's kind of sketchy. And he's here. What, you can do this. Okay. Okay. Darius, since when do you pay with your own money, huh? Let's go somewhere less crowded. Let's go. Now. It wasn't Muirfield. Yeah, I heard. I also heard about, uh, you wanting to burn that photo. Uh, are we breaking up, or...? Just for Heather's benefit. We can't do this anymore, Vincent! You're right. I don't think she heard you. You're right, Catherine. We should break up. I should have just stuck to the original plan. Never seen you before, never see you again. Catherine, you didn't want to lose your sister. So I put her in danger? It wasn't Muirfield this time, but she did post that photo. And I put you in danger, too. I can't believe how selfish I was to even attempt it. No, you weren't being selfish. You just... You wanted this to be a little more normal. The reality is, you can't have that with me. Wait. Are you being serious? You know, just before we pretend break up, maybe you should consider whether it should be pretend. (whooping, cheering, whistling, loud club music playing) Hey. Hey. Excuse me. Hey, have you seen Darius? He's down the hall. Got it. Thanks. Darius? (grunting) Darius! Darius. What are you doing?! Get out of here! Leave him alone! (gasps) (muffled groaning and gasping) My sister's a cop! Shut up. Heather, shh! Look, if you guys do any... (grunting) Hey... Listen, I said, man, I told you, I'll pay you back. I got a big club night going off tomorrow night. Okay? VIP, big money. I'm-I'm good for it. What about her? She tells her sister, the cops start looking at us? We're not gonna let that happen. What are you gonna do? Not us. You. You brought her in, she's your problem. (panting) Ray : She's gonna talk about us, it's all gonna come back to you. Your hero brother is gonna find out what a real loser you are. It's your finger on the trigger. I... (growling) (groaning) (growling) (panting) Heather? Heather? (panting) Oh, no. (siren blaring) (sirens continue wailing in distance) Vincent? What's wrong? (whispers): I killed him. Who? Darius. (soft gasp) Oh, my... oh, my God, is she okay? Yeah. There were these guys, and... they told him to kill her, and... he was gonna do it, he was gonna pull the trigger, and I... I didn't know what to do. I just... You know I didn't mean to. (phone ringing) (exhales) Heather? Are you all right? I'll be right there, okay? Okay. ♪
