 Basically, the animal nucleotides are taking over from the human ones. 
 And whatever it is...  it's changing. 
 Catherine :  He's becoming less human. 
 He says it's mutating; becoming more animal. 
 I should probably go. 
 Heather, uh... 
 I need your keys. 
 I need to go and find somebody. 
 ♪ 
 Heather : Is that her? 
 Is that Cat? 
 Stay in the car. 
 Heather : Wait! Evan...! 
 (growls softly) 
 (growls softly) 
 NYPD! 
 Who's out there? 
 Cat... Cat, can you hear me? 
 Oh, my God... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Heather, I need you! 
 Heather (crying) : Cat...! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God! Is she okay? 
 She is bleeding everywhere. 
 That's the least of her problems. 
 She's barely breathing. 
 What?! 
 Decreased inhalation on the right side. 
 Well, then get her to a hospital. 
 She won't make it to a hospital. 
 Her lung is collapsing. 
 I need you to go back to the car, get that flask of vodka that you had. 
 I need a knife, and a glove, and a rubber band. 
 Okay... 
 You're going to be all right, okay? 
 Just hang in there. 
 Just stay with me, all right? 
 (car door shuts) 
 Come on, Heather! 
 Here, here, here. 
 Great. That's great. 
 Well done. 
 Okay... 
 Okay, this is the compress. 
 Give me your hand. Give it here. 
 What?! 
 Put pressure on it, and hold down. 
 Keep holding it down. 
 Okay. 
 We can't let any more air get in. 
 I think I saw something in the trees. 
 There's nothing out there. 
 Just stay focused, okay? 
 Everything's going to be fine. 
 (crying) 
 You're doing great; just keep that pressure on. 
 I'm going to replace that with this glove, all right? 
 Now keep the pressure down on that. 
 Okay... 
 Wha-wha...? 
 Trust me. 
 (puncturing) 
 Okay, Heather. 
 Breathe. 
 (labored gasp) 
 Breathe... 
 That's it. 
 That's it. 
 That's it. 
 (anxious sigh) 
 (weak exhale) 
 She's going to be fine. 
 Okay, you need to call 911, tell them you have an officer down with a bullet wound, okay? 
 We need a Medevac to New York General immediately. 
 (weak, labored breathing) 
 Just keep breathing. 
 (siren wails in distance) 
 (siren continues, getting closer) 
 Nurse (distant, echoing) : Hey, you're awake. 
 (echoing fades): Don't worry... it's all going to be fine. 
 I have... no idea where I am. 
 New York General. 
 You were Medevac'd in last night. 
 First-timer, I take it. 
 Well, I called and said the other bed was broken, so you could have some peace and quiet. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't really need any crazy roommates right now. 
 Speaking of, um... have you seen my sister? 
 A small version of you, teetering around on heels, reeking of vodka? 
 Sounds about right. 
 She wouldn't leave your side. 
 I finally gave her a banana bag for her hangover and sent her home to sleep. 
 You did great in surgery. 
 Both of them. 
 Both? 
 What are you talking about? 
 The police said you crawled out of a mangled car. 
 Apparently, some do-gooder doctor found you, performed a needle thoracostomy on you in the field, with a pocket knife. 
 If it wasn't for him, you'd be dead. 
 And I'm guessing from that look, you know who he is. 
 He must be special. 
 And then some. 
 I had someone like that once. 
 (sighing): And as much as I'd like to over-share, I have rounds. 
 Um, the doctor will be in shortly. 
 Hang in there. 
 Thanks. 
 (phone vibrating, buzzing) 
 Tess (over phone) : Cat, I'm so sorry. 
 I just got the message. 
 I should have been there for you. 
 I'm on my way now with John Hughes movies and Red Vines. 
 Vincent. 
 What if someone sees you? 
 Playing doctor is kind of in my wheelhouse. 
 Besides, I, uh... 
 I needed to see you. 
 Thank you. 
 My nurse told me about that procedure you did. 
 Yeah, uh, about that... 
 The amazing roadside save. 
 Catherine, uh... 
 Vincent, I'm alive because of you. 
 It wasn't me. 
 It was, uh, it was Evan, actually. 
 I, uh, I just ripped the car door off, I got you out, and, I wanted to stay, uh, to help. 
 But, I just... I couldn't, you know, get back to... being me. 
 And, uh, Evan pulled up, so I had to make a choice. 
 He was your best option. 
 You still saved my life. 
 If you hadn't got me out of that car, Evan never would have gotten to me in time. 
 Well, if he hadn't shown up though, then what? 
 Sure, I can pull a car door off, but you needed a doctor and... 
 I couldn't help you, you know. 
 In that moment, all I could do was... watch you slip away. 
 You know, I thought that I lost you. 
 You didn't lose me. 
 I'm right here. 
 And... I accept all of what you are. 
 That's what I was coming to tell you. 
 I was driving into the city. 
 Even though your DNA is changing, that doesn't have to change things between us. 
 You know you say that now, but just wait until I sprout whiskers and a tail. 
 (phone beeping) 
 Um... 
 It's Evan. 
 He's on his way up. 
 You know if I could stay, I would. 
 I know you would. 
 Uh... 
 You should probably know that Evan might have seen me on the road last night. 
 (whispers): Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye.

 Seeing Red 
Original Air Date on January 24, 2013 
 Cocky grin, bit of a swagger, flowers... 
 Someone's feeling good about themselves. 
 Just thinking about how much you owe me for saving your life. 
 Didn't I just save  your  life? 
 Wasn't that you a couple weeks ago... psycho subway killer? 
 Yeah, the statute of limitations on that expired days ago. 
 Did it? 
 Thank you. 
 I couldn't lose you. 
 So, you are a roadside surgeon. 
 You know, if I could make six figures a year doing that, I would not be in a basement cutting open dead people. 
 And, the way that you pulled me out of Heather's car... 
 Pulled you out? 
 No, I just bravely slammed on the brakes, so I didn't flatten you. 
 So, I was... already on the roadway when you found me? 
 Yeah, you must have crawled out before you lost consciousness. 
 You did lose a hell of a lot of blood. 
 So, I guess I'm a living, breathing miracle. 
 You are to me. 
 Could I...? 
 Yeah, of course, um, do you thing. 
 Uh, I'll check back with you later. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, it's not something wrong with my X-ray, is it? 
 Oh, no. No, no. 
 Everything's... everything's fine with you. 
 Um, weird question: The doctor that came in here earlier, do you know him? 
 I don't know which doctor you're talking about. 
 He's tall, um, he was wearing a lab coat, had a scar on his face. 
 Another nurse saw him walk out of your room. 
 Uh, yeah, a doctor did come in here to check my chart. 
 I didn't recognize him though. Why? 
 (sighs) 
 Still cool to over-share? 
 Always. 
 I know this is going to... sound crazy, but... the doctor I saw is supposed to be dead. 
 It was Vincent Keller. 
 Hey. 
 So, I've been thinking, maybe you're mutating DNA could be another evolutionary step. 
 Like, a-a new manimal ability breaking through. 
 Anything physical changing? 
 I don't know, man, I guess. 
 My eyes have been playing up on me. 
 Probably just allergies, but who knows. 
 We can't really predict how you'll evolve. 
 Maybe you'll change genders like a clown fish. 
 (laughs) 
 Come on, that was a joke. 
 Yeah... 
 What? 
 I saw Alex today. 
 Alex Salter? 
 Yeah, I didn't talk to her, I just, I ran, you know. 
 Like I did ten years ago. 
 You have to stop beating yourself up, man. 
 You know, I never got to say good-bye and... 
 I never even reached out when I got back. 
 And you had a damn good reason. 
 Muirfield was hunting you. 
 If they found you anywhere near her, they'd-- 
 No, you're right, you're right. 
 I never wanted her involved in any of this. 
 The return of reason? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (laughs) 
 My favorite part. 
 I was actually off the campus to get some of my own. 
 Sarah's an earth sciences professor, emphasis in evolution. 
 Sarah...! 
 Thought I might hit her up with some veiled mutation questions. 
 Good for you. 
 Hey, just remember to, uh, make sure I'm not turning into a female clown fish, okay? 
 (laughs) Or are you? 
 Funny. 
 (phone vibrating, buzzing) 
 Heather : You should've seen Evan. 
 He was, like, ripping his clothes off, and I was all Meredith Grey, like, holding the bloody compress for him. 
 Thanks for all the details. 
 Yeah. 
 Wait... (groans) am I holding you up, or are you holding me up? 
 I am so sorry. 
 Or hung over. 
 Could-could I just run to the pharmacy really quickly? 
 A coffee plus aspirin and I'm good to go, I promise. 
 I'll be right back. 
 You go. 
 I'll just be right here. 
 I'll be holding this wall up. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 (groans) 
 Did you get my message? 
 I told you it isn't safe to come back here. 
 And I didn't want Heather to overhear. 
 Okay, so what's going on? 
 Evan trying to hunt down the vigilante again? 
 More like my nurse. 
 You might know her-- 
 Alex Salter. 
 Who is she? 
 Uh... we were just friends. 
 We grew up together. 
 Her, me, JT, my brothers, you know... and, uh, and later, we-we were pretty close. 
 Well, that explains it. 
 Explains what? 
 Why she was such a wreck. 
 No... no, no, no, no, no. 
 You're just misreading her. 
 It's been over ten years. 
 She saw a ghost. 
 No, Vincent, I'm not misreading her. 
 I should go; Heather's going to be here any second. 
 (car alarm chirps) 
 It's me. 
 Two soldiers came to your mom's house. 
 They said you were dead. 
 Alex... 
 I was... I was a part of a Special Ops force. 
 Okay, I... I had seen too much, and... 
 I knew too much. 
 I threw dirt on your casket, Vince. 
 (crying) 
 What could be so bad that I had to do that? 
 I know that this is going to be hard to understand, okay? 
 But you have to believe me. 
 I promise the funeral was... it was to protect you and everyone I cared about. 
 Alex, my enemies, they were out there; they were watching. 
 I mean... they are still out there. 
 You could've come to me. 
 No, no, it was far too dangerous. 
 You would've been caught in the crossfire. 
 These people, they are dangerous, and they want me dead. 
 This... whole secret life... what do you do? 
 It's not much of a life. 
 Who else knows? 
 Fine. 
 Wh-What about the detective? 
 Who is she? 
 And don't say no one. 
 She's just, she's a cop that they assigned me to. 
 All right? 
 She looks out for me. 
 She's like a, like a handler. 
 You should've just given up on me. 
 I loved you. 
 Alex, when I saw you today in the hospital-- 
 You mean, when you ran away. 
 I have... played this moment over and over in my head for years. 
 Okay? 
 I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry. 
 I can't do this. 
 Alex, I wanted to contact you every day. 
 Okay? Believe me. 
 Every day, but... it was easier to imagine that you had some perfect husband, and three perfect kids somewhere. 
 I wanted that in my life, once. 
 We both did. 
 But I just... 
 Couldn't move on. 
 Am I going to see you again? 
 A stuffed bear? 
 How pathetic am I? 
 No... you? 
 Not even on the Richter scale. 
 Your loser partner, closing in on a ten. 
 Wait, no Red Vines? 
 (sighs) 
 Who knew 11 was even possible? 
 I'm sorry. 
 There is no way we could've known what would happen to me. 
 You have to let it go, okay? 
 Okay. 
 No, not okay. 
 Shoulders aren't lifting. 
 What's up with you? 
 You said you were staying late to work on stuff. 
 (sighs) 
 Fine. Um, well, you know, last night in the precinct, Joe and I had a couple drinks, maybe more, and it got... weird. 
 Weird, how? 
 Naked weird? 
 No. But he's married. 
 And even if they're having problems, I don't want to be sloppy seconds. 
 You know, the other woman thing sucks. 
 Yeah, you never know where you stand. 
 Okay, if we don't drop this, I'm going to break out into a rash. 
 What's on the laptop-- p0rn? 
 No... 
 Uh! My turn to pry. 
 (groans) 
 Well, a little Facebook stalking. 
 Alex Salter. 
 And he's... 
 A she, my nurse. 
 I don't know, a little detective thing. 
 Tess : All right, well, if you want to know who's changing your bed pan, ditch the social media crap, and get on the NYPD database. 
 That's a little bit deeper than I wanted to dig. 
 I got a hit. 
 She doesn't have a record, but she filed six police reports in three months. 
 She complained of someone following her, checking her e-mails, wire tapping, and breaking and entering. 
 But there's no signs of forced entry. 
 Are there any leads? 
 Well, it's Precinct 86. 
 Those stooges haven't even looked into it yet. 
 Only thing they did was make notes. 
 "Paranoid and delusional." 
 That's pretty big words for those guys. 
 But, then again, your nurse does sound a little 5150. 
 (yawns) 
 Okay, this is going about as well as my love live, so... why don't I let you rest? 
 Okay. 
 Thanks, Tess. 
 You got it. 
 See you tomorrow? 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 (auto-dial beeping) 
 (line ringing) 
 What? 
 Catherine : I think that Alex is being watched. 
 She says there's some faceless person following her. 
 They tapped her phone, broke into her apartment. 
 Well, it wasn't Vincent. 
 He never went to see her, he always said it was too painful. 
 He cared about her too much. 
 Well, does it sound like someone else we know? 
 Walks around without a face... taps into electronics without being detected. 
 JT, what if this is Muirfield? 
 Oh, God. 
 Put Vincent on the phone. 
 I need to warn him. 
 I can't. 
 Why? 
 I-I'm guessing he's with Alex. 
 (sighs) 
 (monitor alarm beeps) 
 (car alarm chirps) 
 (gasps) 
 I saw you with your little soldier boyfriend. 
 That was him, right? 
 I bet he's gonna miss you. 
 I've been thinking about this for a long time. 
 (gunshot) 
 Stop! (groans) 
 (gasping) 
 I don't even know how to thank you. 
 (grunts) 
 How did you know I'd be in trouble? 
 I, uh... I didn't. 
 I was just stopping by to say thank you for the great health care. 
 Or maybe you started keeping tabs on me, because of Vince? 
 Of him coming to see me, I mean. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Vince told me everything. 
 Obviously, that's... that's just what you do when you're somebody's handler. 
 Alex, uh, who was that guy? 
 Uh... 
 I'd never seen him before, but... he seemed to know me. 
 He said he'd been thinking about doing this for years. 
 Detective Chandler, he might be the person that's been watching me. 
 I had a break-in a few weeks ago. 
 Oh, really? 
 Did, uh, they take anything? 
 No. 
 It was weird. 
 I think whoever it was just went through my closet.

♪ You came when he called... 
 (knocking at door) 
 Vincent : Alex. 
 Alex, it's Vince. 
 Open up. 
 Vince? 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Uh, Catherine called and left a message. 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, she's... she's amazing. 
 Your handler, she... she saved my life. 
 Right. 
 Alex : I, uh... wasn't sure if I was gonna see you again. 
 Vincent : Yeah, well, I'm-I'm here now. 
 Is she in there? 
 Alex : Oh, yes, sorry. 
 She's right in here. 
 She's in the bedroom. 
 "Handler"? Really? 
 I didn't know what else to say, I... 
 Sorry, uh, no trace of the perp. 
 Well, they already dusted for prints so I figured it was a long shot. 
 But he was in the apartment? 
 Yeah, we think a couple weeks ago, so any scent of him is probably long gone. 
 They find any other evidence? 
 A hair, some mud from shoes, but I never heard back. 
 Probably booked it into Property without analyzing it. 
 Sometimes it's easier to call someone crazy rather than face the facts. 
 You stay here with her. 
 I'll be back. 
 (wry laugh) 
 Cat, what the hell are you doing here? 
 Following up on evidence. 
 Yeah, of course, but when you called it in, I thought you were actually calling it in. 
 Sit down. 
 Okay. 
 (groans) 
 Your bandage is bleeding through. 
 Did your doctor release you? 
 Yeah. 
 He said he was fine with my recovery. 
 Take down your jacket. 
 Evan, you don't have to do this. 
 Look, if he's not going to look after you properly, I sure as hell am. 
 (sighs) 
 (groans quietly) 
 By the way, my nurse said your work was "exquisite." 
 She said that only the best-trained surgeon could have pulled that off. 
 Not a medical examiner for NYPD. 
 Another time, Cat. 
 You, uh, get a match on that hair? 
 I did. 
 But why are you digging around in an old case from Precinct 86? 
 Just a favor. 
 And because it's Precinct 86. 
 Point taken. 
 Yeah, I pulled a name and a photo. 
 He's an ex-con, released a couple of months ago. goes by the name of Connor... 
 Connor Sorvino-- he was shot twice in the takedown. 
 He had three months in recovery, and the hospital records I pulled, they showed you as the attending. 
 Oh, my God. 
 We used to call him "Con Man." 
 He-he thought he was in love with me. 
 He kept asking me to marry him, but I said... 
 What is it? 
 Over-share, remember? 
 I... said I was already in love. 
 That my heart belonged to someone else. 
 Uh, okay, uh, Catherine, you got to put a call out on that guy. 
 He's dangerous. 
 It's not as easy as that. 
 Forensics will sweep this place and Alex's car. 
 Alex : Meaning they'll... they'll find Vince's DNA? 
 No, no. We can't have that. 
 Vincent : I'm not having you walk around like some kind of target. 
 Alex : Use me as bait. 
 I'll have you two looking out for me. 
 No. 
 If we could draw him out. 
 That's not a good idea. 
 Just listen. 
 Connor's hacked my e-mails, I know it. 
 Sometimes he forgets to mark the new ones "unread." 
 If I write to a friend and say that I was taking off after a shift to be with the guy I love. 
 Catherine : We don't know if he'll take that bait. 
 Wait, are you saying that this is a good call? 
 It's not your call. 
 It's mine. 
 (typing) 
 (indistinct conversation) 
 ♪ 
 (explosion thunders, people scream) 
 Over here; come with me. 
 Come with me! 
 This way! This way! 
 (alarm buzzing) 
 Damn it! 
 What's wrong? 
 She was just here! 
 She's still here. 
 We'll find her. 
 (panting) 
 Okay, come on. 
 This place is a damn echo chamber. 
 I can hardly hear them. 
 It's gonna be quicker to find her if we split up. 
 Or you find Connor first. 
 And then what? 
 I don't think I can cover up for you again. 
 Alex's life is at stake. 
 Just be careful. (sighs)

 Connor! Connor, please! 
 Stop! Please, you... 
 Please, you don't...

 Alex : You don't have to do this! 
 I-I was good to you. 
 I-I took care of you. 
 That's why you would've been the perfect wife. 
 All you had to say was yes. 
 (gasps) 
 When I saw you with that Army grunt, I knew you'd never love anyone else, that no one could take the place of... (clicking in distance)

 Please... let me go!

 Great! 
 I can't see you. 
 But if you don't come out... how will you ever save her from me? 
 No? 
 Okay. 
 But you just remember... this was your choice. 
 (growling) 
 How'd you do that? 
 (switches clank, generators whirr) 
 Vincent : Alex! 
 Alex!

 Fricking night vision? 
 That is so cool.

 Man, you'd be an ugly chick. 
 Yeah, and sending you out to buy bras would've been awkward. 
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't think gender reassignment's on the mutation menu. 
 Thanks. 
 So, why is it happening now, then? 
 I think it's been happening for a while, we just missed the symptoms. 
 You, roaming around on autopilot-- there's a physical toll to evolving so fast. 
 So, what, they're basically growing pains? 
 Think about it: what you developed in a week, most species would take a million years to pull off. 
 Yeah, well, I'm just glad it happened when it did. 
 Must have felt pretty good to save Alex. 
 Yeah. Yeah, it did. 
 Anyway, aren't you late for office hours? 
 (knocking on door) 
 Evan : Dr. Forbes. 
 Evan Marks. 
 NYPD, Medical Examiner's Office. 
 Do you have a moment? 
 Is there a problem? 
 Uh... I got, like, 50 exams to grade. 
 No, not at all. 
 It's about something that you wrote eight years ago, on cross-species DNA. 
 It's a strange subject. 
 But I'm curious on the paper that you published on it. 
 Oh, yeah, the whole "Dolly the Sheep" thing went down and I was trying to ride that wave. 
 But that was years ago. 
 Well, you raised some very valid questions back then, on how to splice species, and how to reverse it. 
 Well, it wasn't as breakthrough as I thought. 
 It was a dead end. 
 See, I don't think it was. 
 In fact, I'll go on further and say that I have evidence that a cross-species creature exists. 
 All right, I'm on the edge of something groundbreaking. 
 But this isn't exactly my area of expertise. 
 I could do with the help of a biochemist... and I was hoping that it'd be the man who published a paper on it. 
 You really want out of that morgue. 
 I just don't want someone that I care about to end up in it. 
 You... think this thing's a threat to her? 
 Or... him? 
 I would include you in all aspects of the investigation. 
 We'd share research, information, everything. 
 Even the spotlight. 
 So, what do you say? 
 I can help you with that. 
 The, uh... the dressing part. 
 No, I got it. 
 (clears throat softly) 
 What do you got there? 
 What? What is it? 
 Show me. 
 (sighs) 
 You took this? 
 I didn't mean to. 
 It really... it was an accident. 
 Um... 
 I don't know. 
 I guess I, uh... 
 I wanted to know him. 
 Hey, that guy isn't completely gone, okay? 
 Not when you're with her. 
 You and I... we came together out of some pretty dark places. 
 It doesn't mean that this isn't real. 
 It doesn't mean that it's good. 
 Is this your way of dodging you and me? 
 Think about it. 
 You know, why are we still stuck here? 
 You know, why don't you and me move forward? 
 It... it's complicated. 
 No, I think it's convenient that it's complicated. 
 Remember that I've watched over you for years.
