 (music continues over radio) 
 Wow, dollar Lemon Drops, and all of Westchester shows up. 
 Yeah, never underestimate the power of cheap booze. 
 And a hot, new, Ivy-educated bartender. 
 You want me to close for you. 
 No! 
 (chuckling): Yes! 
 Okay, maybe a little bit. 
 Go. 
 All I have waiting for me are LSAT practice tests. 
 You're the best! 
 Your fortune, Dolly. 
 Thank you. Now, I am totally gonna hire you if I ever get arrested. 
 Or divorced. 
 Mm. 
 Bye.

 Woman : Hello. 
 (sheepishly): Hi, Mom. 
 I'm like AAA but with outerwear. 
 Would you put that on? 
 It's freezing out. 
 I'm so sorry I dragged you all the way out here, but the good news is I made a lot in tips. 
 Enough to cover tuition? 
 Eh. Books for, like, (chuckling): one class. 
 Already a lawyer like Dad. 
 You're just lucky I was on call. 
 He would've killed you. 
 That wasn't luck. 
 You always come running when I need you. 
 What are these guys doing? 
 Hey! We're closed! 
 Hello, we're closed! 
 We're good here! 
 Get in my car.

 Catherine :  Everyone told me it was a wild animal-- a coyote, a bear. 
 That this thing I thought I'd seen was just the result of my concussion or post-traumatic stress. 
 You know, the men who'd killed my mother beasts. I believed them... until now. ♪ ♪ (siren chirping) (siren chirping) Hey, Detective, what you doing? Just give me five. Zeke! Hey. Sorry. Ooh! (chuckles) Um, you know my boss hates his wife, which means he never wants to leave work, which means I don't get to... Which means you didn't get my text. What? At first your job was kind of a turn on. Now it's kind of a drag. Like tonight, if I want to smoke pot... Look, you can smoke pot. I don't care. Woman : Hey! Z-babe! "Z-babe"? Sorry, Cat. It's just been stressing me out. Really? That's what you texted me? We got to bust. You know what, Z-babe? This wasn't working for me either. Security! That guy's got pot on him. Guys... (phone ringing) Chandler. Woman :  You should've tased him. "Kind of a turn on." So what, he was in it just for handcuffs? Don't guys know they just remind us of work? Tess, he didn't ask for the cuffs. (sighs) You have a blind spot for douches. See, when I date a douche, I know he's a douche, which is why I'm on a man cleanse. Good, 'cause you can be my date to my dad's engagement party. Special Crimes. 911 got a call off her cell at 8:32 tonight. No recording. Blunt trauma to the head. No wallet, no ID, no hotel key. Robbery homicide? And leave behind a Louis Vuitton? You know how much these things cost? No, and not every robber knows their Louis Vuitton. I knew it was a Louis. Regardless, it's a pretty public place to rob and kill someone. And this is a five-star hotel. Okay. Then can we get some five-star service? Maybe take a look at some security footage? Yeah? Oh, great. An injured woman walks into a hotel, no one even blinks. You got to love New York. So where is our bad guy? That we don't know, but we did ID the vic off cell records-- Ashley Webster. Not a hotel guest. Hey, boss. Google says she's executive editor at  Couture Bleu Magazine. She have a husband? Boyfriend? Lesbian lover? Yeah, husband-- Alex Webster. Big fashion photographer. They're, like, a Page Six power couple. So, where is Mr. Powerful now? Haven't been able to track him down. But CSU did lift prints off a button. Hey. Get me the results. Right. Catherine : AFIS got a hit, and it's not the husband. Guy's name is Vincent Keller. What are his priors? None. Looks like he's military. He's dead. Specialist Vincent Keller, MD, New York City. Killed in Afghanistan by enemy fire, 2002. The rest is redacted. So, how do a dead guy's prints end up on a fashion editor's buttons? I would say talk to his family, but look, next of kin, they've all passed, too. MD. He was a doctor. Here. ER resident, St. Benjamin's. '99 to 2001. Okay. Let's find some colleagues. See if they know something. Tess (distantly) : Cat? Cat? (normal voice): Hospital? Yes. Let's do it. Woman :  Dr. Keller. 'Course I remember him. Most of these residents come in cocky, thinking they know everything. Keller wasn't like that. You know he lost his brothers in the towers? No, we didn't. Yeah, he was here that day. Kept waiting for 'em to be brought in. Never came to work after that. That's why he enlisted. So, you haven't seen him since? For detectives, you two don't know very much. No, we know he's supposedly dead. Supposedly? There's a plaque in the lobby with his name on it. You remember anyone he hung out with, someone he would've reached out to? Keller wasn't exactly social, but he did have a roommate. "JT Forbes, medical researcher." This is where he lives-- a chemical plant? Researcher-- maybe he works from home? Yeah, or it's a meth lab. Just my type. Oh, a little Zeke rebound? You can make out in that. This'll be condos in two years. Guy needs a new decorator. JT Forbes? NYPD. Mr. Forbes, open up. (rock music playing in background) JT Forbes? I'm Detective Chandler. This is Detective Vargas. Uh, this isn't about that speeding ticket, is it? 'Cause I'm gonna pay. No, we're here to talk to you about a former roommate, Vincent Keller? Vincent Keller? Vincent Keller. It sucks, you know? What happened. (turns off music) So young. So, I'm assuming you haven't heard from him recently? Like voices or...? No, like him. His fingerprints just showed up at a crime scene. Oof. Sounds like you need new fingerprint guys. Or is there any reason Mr. Keller might want people to think he's dead? Maybe he was in trouble... JT : He was in Afghanistan. Of course he was in trouble. Tess : A woman was murdered in the Stanwyck Hotel last night. Maybe you read about it? Think we could take a look around? Uh, listen, I'd love to help you guys, but I gotta take off. Bio-chem class to teach. Okay, well, let us know if you think of anything. Totally. Did you clock the stairs? Yeah, too bad creepy digs aren't grounds for a warrant. But, you know, maybe if you hook up with him... Or you break your man cleanse. (footsteps approach) What the hell did you do? That was her. ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x01 ♪ Pilot 
Original Air Date on October 11, 2012 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Do you want a beer? No, no, I don't want a beer. I want you to tell me what the hell your prints are doing at a crime scene. Look, a woman was in trouble. Trouble? Trouble, trouble how? I mean, did you...? No, JT, I didn't hurt her. Well, congratulations 'cause now we've got  her  at our door. Yeah, well, I didn't know it was going to be her case, did I? Her case. Wh-What... Have you been keeping tabs on her? Vincent, you broke every rule: no interacting with anyone, no entering a building... Yeah, I know what the rules are, okay, I made them. It's been years, all right? It starts to feel like a prison in here. What prison has a flat screen and an Xbox? And if it's so hard for you, why'd you stop helping with the antidote? Yeah, because you know what the definition of insanity is, JT? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, okay? That's why. All right, this is it, JT, this is my life. Okay. All I'm saying is, if Catherine Chandler starts asking questions, alerting Muirfield that you're alive... we're both dead men, and I don't mean "on a piece of paper" dead. I mean dead like  dead  dead. (siren chirps) Evan, please tell me that you have something. I've got a pair of Louboutins in an evidence bag. What size are you? You are so callous. Okay, so the head wounds are too superficial to have killed her, but she does have signs of low oxygenation. Suffocation, strangulation? No ligature marks, but she does have some rash. Possibly poisoning? But here's the weird part. I can't take much more weird. Bruised sternum, cracked ribs. You see that from CPR sometimes. So, after the killer left, someone tried to save her? Why wouldn't they have stuck around? That's your job. Oh, I did find a hair. DNA? Way to bury the lead. Um, keep me posted. Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night? I've got premiere tickets. Free movie, open bar. What, that flight attendant on layover? Permanently transferred to Dallas. By you or by the airline? Well, it was coming up to three months. I may have pulled some strings. (phone beeping) Oh. Our vic's husband surfaced. Always the husband. See, this is why I stick to three months. Yeah, well, in this case, our prime suspect is a dead guy. I've never seen him before. And you were at your studio all night? Yes. I'm sorry to have to ask this, Mr. Webster, but anyone who can confirm that? The security guard. Oh, and, uh, I have the proofs that I was developing. Were you at a club as well? No. No, I was at a fund-raiser. I dropped in there on my way to the office. Did she go with you? No, no, she had to work. She just landed a big promotion. She started out as an intern there. Time-stamped from last night. Mr. Webster, that promotion-- you think it would have earned her any enemies? You'd have to ask her assistant Emily. You have a sleeping bag in there? I probably should. It's a 24-7 gig. I mean, it was. But, Emily, was anyone jealous of Ashley's promotion or up for that job, too? Maybe the beauty editor, but... The beauty editor? Chloe London. She thought that she deserved the job, but, I'm sorry, Ashley was the fashion editor. Evan : Cat. DNA just came in. Can I talk to you for a sec? So who is it-- Vincent Keller? It's corrupted. Oh, you're kidding. Thing is, you know how you're always talking about your mum's case? Not always, but... Evan, you're making me nervous. No, no. I just wanted to give you a heads up. The mass spectrometer's probably just dirty. Cross-species DNA. ♪ Your ancient threat ♪ 
♪ I can hear it from the garden ♪ 
♪ I can see it coming ♪ 
♪ I can see it come for miles... ♪ Tess :  A little Zeke rebound? You can make out in that. (phone ringing) Hey. Tess : Hey, nice catch with JT's car, except I just woke up three of his students. All confirm he was teaching Molecular Cellular Methods 2 that night. Yeah, I'm here. I don't see you. Creepy warehouse-- I was up early, thought I'd check it out. No, that's what I'm telling you-- there's nothing to check out. I'll call you later. Hello? Catherine :  NYPD. I've got a warrant. Mr. Forbes. (rustling) Mr. Forbes. Mr. Forbes? Mr. Forbes. I know you're up here, I can hear you. (rustling) Vincent : He's teaching class. I need you to step out where I can see you. Sir, I'm not going to ask you again. (quietly): Okay. You're Vincent Keller. You look pretty good for a dead guy. I did not kill that woman. And I didn't mention a murder, but since you brought it up... why were your prints at the Webster crime scene? Look, I was out driving. I saw her collapse. She hit her head, she needed help. So you followed her into the hotel? I tried to resuscitate her. You gave her CPR. You're a doctor. She had been poisoned. How would you know that? (phone buzzing) Your phone. Hey, has tox come back on the Webster case yet? Our telepathy is working. Positive for lethal doses of nicotine. Cat, I just gave you cause of death. Yeah, that's great. Okay. I got to go. I'll see you at the cinema at 9:00, yeah? Yeah, sounds good. (phone beeps off) How'd you know she was poisoned if you didn't kill her? I have a good sense of smell. You can smell poison? Look, I did not hurt her, okay? But you were a witness. Look, I need your help. There was hair found on the body, matches DNA from an old murder case. That night did you see anything? Why do you have that? I need to know why you have that. I... Tess : Catherine. No one can know I'm here. Why? Why does everybody need to think you're dead? Please, you know I did not hurt that woman. Tess : NYPD. Please. We're not done here. NYPD. Hey. It's all clear. What the hell are you doing? You were right, there's nothing here. Come on, let's go. Come on. Hi, this is Detective Catherine Chandler, NYPD. I need to speak to Special Agent Hernandez. Transferred when? Joe's waiting for an update. Two minutes. Okay, then who can I speak to about a case he covered nine years ago? All right, nicotine, when ingested, kills in seconds. Security footage is longer than that, so it must have been absorbed through her skin, in which case it can take two to four hours to work. So where was she during that period of time? We checked her date book, hard drive-- no appointments, she wasn't at work. Great, great, great, so we are nowhere. I can't wait to tell the DA. (distantly): How's our dead vet fit in? 
 
 ♪ ♪ (distantly): Hello. Cat. (normal voice): Dead vet-- how's he fit in? He doesn't. Well, you were suspicious enough to execute a search. Dead, not dead-- this isn't an identity case. We need to focus on finding the source of the poison. Ashley was a fashion editor. You want to kill her, you probably don't do it with window cleaner. Then, what do you do it with? Woman :  Do you really think Ashley  was poisoned by something that came from the beauty closet? Ms. London, we're trying to figure out what happened, and since you're the beauty editor... That is a hair product, not a body lotion. Does everyone get their samples from the beauty closet? If they're nice to me. They sign them out? And log it. Do you have any idea how much these stuff costs? So Ashley Webster being promoted over you, doesn't sound too nice. Okay, we're done here. Ms. London... Chloe : I don't mean to be rude, I have an editorial meeting that started five minutes ago. This is Ashley's office. It's the executive editor's office. Oh, so you got that promotion after all. Not the way I wanted it. Look, I may not have loved Ashley, but I didn't kill her. (knocking on glass) Now if you'll excuse me, I have an issue to get out. I trust the two of you can find your own way out? Yeah, we sure can. It's Ashley's stuff. Pregnancy test. There's two missing. So Ashley was pregnant? Autopsy wouldn't have caught it if it was early enough. Husband didn't seem like he knew. Maybe it wasn't his. So maybe she was cheating, husband found out? (phone ringing) Chandler. This is Special Agent McCleary, FBI. You called about a contaminated DNA sample linked to the murder case of Vanessa Chandler? Yeah, I was hoping we could meet up? (man speaks indistinctly over P.A.) Detective Chandler. Agent McCleary. I appreciate you doing this. Hope it wasn't too out of your way. Well, I wouldn't want to be the reason you were late for your son's birthday. (chuckling) Did you bring it with you? I did. The analysis looks corrupted, but the numbers are identical. Well, we'll take a look. (blade snicks) (grunting) (Catherine cries out) (yelling) (man cries out) (music playing through earbuds): ♪ Just call me angel ♪ 
♪ Ah, ah ♪ 
♪ Just touch my cheek before you leave me... ♪ (both groaning) (grunting) (yelling) (pained grunt) (growling, Catherine gasps) (blows landing, grunting) (grunting) (man screaming) (gun clatters) Hey! Hey, I know you're down here! Come out, come out! Hey! Come out here! I know you're here! I know you can see me! (horn sounding) (horn blaring) You're him. So, are we gonna talk about it? You need to keep this clean and dry. Avoidance. One of my favorite techniques. How about a drink? Can you drink? Not such a good idea. Maybe not for you. Look, my roommate is home... Hey, I-I-I promise that I will be quiet. It's just... three people did just try to kill me, and, uh... you killed two of them. I think we got beer. Great. It's just a hobby. Here. Um, yeah, my mom, she... she used to have this stuff lying around, too. She's the one, nine years ago. So, um, what happened to you? Did someone do this to you? (faint voices echoing) I should've asked questions. (faint voices echoing) Any word from your brothers? They're still trying to get everyone out. (echoes):  They're still trying to get everyone out. But I was too angry. Confused. So you enlisted. Yeah. (closing door echoes) Once I got over there, I was tapped. They told me that I had the chance to be part of something great,  that I could make a difference. It was called Operation Muirfield. They told us they were vitamins, antibiotics,  steroids that would protect us. What were they? Like I said, I should've asked questions. All I know is that they changed our DNA. (automatic gunfire) They made us stronger,  faster... better. They heightened our reflexes, our senses. That's why you could smell the poison. Yeah. But something went wrong. Anytime the adrenaline kicked in, we became monsters. They couldn't stop us. We couldn't stop us. So they gave orders to shut it down, to eradicate us all. (chopper blades whirring) (men shouting) (explosion) How did you survive? Luck. (wry laugh) So... all of this... for an antidote. It doesn't work. You've just been hiding out here? Yeah. JT's the only one I can trust. Except you, you go out there and you save people. No. No... you do. You saved me, and you tried to save Ashley Webster. I guess it reminds me of who I used to be. A doctor? Human. You should probably leave now. Vincent, that night nine years ago, why were you there... I already told you more than I should. That agent on the platform was from Muirfield, okay? You're on their radar. Why? Vincent, does this have something to do with my mom? I don't know anything about your mom. I'm sorry, okay? But you can not come back here. It is too dangerous for the both of us. No, I just... Just go. Go. Tess : There you are. I've been calling and calling you. Were you with Zeke? What? That glow. What glow? The s*x glow. It's all over your face. I don't have a glow. I'm just excited. I found the murder weapon. Evan said he went through everything. It's what's not here that's important. Look, the sign-out sheet. Ashley signed out four products the day before she died. Our guys only found three. Killer probably took the fourth. So someone put poison in Ashley's True to Color Blonde? Catherine : Hey, Evan, any way to tell if that nicotine was absorbed through Taylor's scalp? I'll check her hair follicles. You do realize that I waited for hours and hours last night? This one stood me up. Oh, my God, the premiere. Movie was lousy. Good swag bag. Then I got called into here. My guys found these in the power couple's bed. Oh. Bedbugs? That rash I showed you was actually bites. Since these things are little bloodsuckers, they carry the DNA of whoever's been rolling around in those sheets. Your vic wasn't pregnant. It was the hubby that was stepping out. Can those mini vampires tell us who with? Sorry, ladies, we're not open yet. Actually, I'm Detective Chandler, and this is Detective Vargas. Tess : Alex's proofs from the night his wife died-- that was you. You were having an affair with him. Alex told me not to say anything. He said it would just make me look guilty, especially 'cause of the prenup. What prenup? If he cheats, he loses everything. But I didn't kill her, I swear. Catherine :  It's not just this hostess. We have bedbug DNA... Hey! ...from four other women. I'm eating here! Alex Webster had access to the poison, and he had motive-- the prenup. Except there was no prenup. I just read the forensic accounting report. If he wanted out, all he had to do was file for divorce. Now, if you will excuse me, I have some FBI nonsense to deal with. (clears throat) Sir. What's going on? I don't know. Bodies from the subway. Vincent :  The agents on the platform were  from Muirfield. You are on their radar. It is too dangerous for the both of us. Don't see you guys out here very often. What's the occasion? Just following orders, Detective. Of course, we're gonna need to take that back. Of course. Just making sure you're not stealing our case. Detective Chandler. Vincent : Hey. (gasps) Oh, my God, you scared me. You're the one snooping around my place. Hey, some military guys just showed up. They took the agents from the platform away. You didn't talk to them, did you? No. I asked them what they were doing, and I came straight here. Yeah, well, you shouldn't have done that. I wasn't followed. I needed to warn you. Look, you need to leave. No. Listen to me. Look, I lost my phone on the platform. What if the Muirfield people have it, and they know about you? This is why you have to stop all contact with me. What about my mom? I know what it's like to lose someone you love, but you need to move on. You can't tell me to just move on! Well, so what? You'll solve your mother's murder, exact justice? Trust me, it does not end well. Well, I'm gonna take my chances. You don't get it, do you?! No, I do! You can't tell me everything, and that's fine. I don't need all the answers, but last night-- that was the first time since my mom died that I haven't felt crazy. (inhales deeply) You are crazy showing up here alone! I could kill you in less than a second! Now go! (roars): Go! (panting) Catherine :  Last night, I realized that I was  thinking about your wife's case the wrong way. Sometimes things aren't what they seem. You can't tell who the real monsters are. I didn't kill my wife. We just spoke to a woman you're having an affair with, and I have DNA that proves there are at least four others. You made every one of your women fall in love with you and think that the only thing standing in the way of their fairy tale ending was some pretend prenup. Mr. Webster, I don't think you killed your wife. But you are the reason she's dead. I need a list of names. Everyone you slept with during your marriage. You owe it to Ashley. Hey. Are you looking for Chloe? I'm her new assistant. Actually, Emily, uh, we want to talk to you. Catherine : Look, we appreciate how helpful you've been, but you forgot to mention one thing. Alex. Alex? Alex Webster-- you were having an affair with him. Tess : The missing pregnancy tests-- we assumed they were Ashley's, but you used them, didn't you? That's why you had saltines in your purse. I don't know what you're... The sign-out sheet. I'm pretty sure if we showed this to an expert, they'd confirm that this was you signing out Ashley's True to Color Blond. No. Uh, Chloe ran the closet... You wanted us to think it was her so that you could run off into the sunset with Alex. But there was no prenup. That's impossible. He lied. Just like he lied to all his women, including the one that he was with the night that you killed Ashley. I'm not even pregnant anymore. I lost it. You tell us where the bottle is, we'll make sure that the DA knows how remorseful you are. (distant siren wailing) Are we okay? You've been having secret conversations, you executed that search without me, and my brother's investigating the subway case... he found this on the platform. What were you doing on the F train? All right, just forget it. Just know I'm here, no judgments, you ever want to talk. Hey, it's Devil and Prada. Nice work. Hey, as long as I get to be Devil. So I'm not letting you celebrate your big case alone at your father's engagement party. What's the dress code? Evan, you don't have to do that. Oh, come on. Free drinks, and I'm assuming your vapid stepmother insisted on a good caterer. You're just doing this out of... Charity. Yeah, poor little single girl. Did Tess tell you about Zeke? No, Joe did. How does Joe know? (laughs) I don't know. But I wouldn't ask him now. He's just found out the department has to shell out for a new spectrometer. Yeah, I took a look over some old cases. Six more samples, all with the same corrupted DNA. Six. Really? Yeah, so I guess we'll see what's what once we get our new spectrometer. Maybe you weren't so crazy after all. Right there. What are you gonna do? Check. (footsteps approaching) Hi. Hi. Hi? H-Hi? Did I miss something, or...? JT, you mind? Wow. Just, you look... I have an engagement party. Right. Look, I know you're gonna try to kick me out. I get it. I-I get what it's like to hide out and push people away 'cause you don't feel deserving. Do you know why I keep asking about my mom? Because I'm the reason that she's dead. If I hadn't left the stupid vanity mirror open... But, Vincent, I just found six cases of you trying to save victims around the city. You're not a monster. I would know. There are a lot of guys out there that are, but... You saved my life. Twice. Catherine, wait. You're not the reason your mom's dead. They were tracking her. I'm not sure why, but it wasn't your fault. (gasps) Catherine :  Sometimes it feels like everyone's moved on, but they all miss you in their own way. ♪ And the arms of the ocean are carrying me... ♪ Mom, there's not a day that goes by when I don't think about you. The good news is... I know now I'm not crazy. I saved by a beast. He didn't get there in time to save you, but he's still out there. And I have a feeling that now, we're going to have to save each other. ♪ Never let me go, never let me go ♪
