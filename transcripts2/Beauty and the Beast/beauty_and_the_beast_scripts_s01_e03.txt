 Catherine :  Nine years ago, I witnessed my mother's murder. 
 I would have been killed, too,  if it hadn't been for Vincent. 
 Vincent :  I was part of an experimental special forces group. 
 Their goal was to create the perfect super soldier. 
 They made us stronger, faster, better. 
 But something went wrong. 
 They gave orders to kill us all. 
 Somehow I survived and have been in hiding ever since. Catherine :  Until a case brought me back to him, but also alerted the group that experimented on him. Now we're both in danger. Vincent : And our best chance at survival  is if we save each other. ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x03 ♪ All In 
Original Air Date on October 25, 2012 A law clerk leaving in the middle of the afternoon? My college roommate's surprise party is tonight, Your Honor. See you bright and early. Bye. Don't drink too much. (car alarm chirps) (tires squealing, engine revving) (grunts) (screaming) (grunts, tires squealing) (gasping, tires squealing, engine revving) Oh. ♪ 
♪ ♪ Leave the lights on... Yeah, I'll check you out online tomorrow, okay? Okay. Hey. Do you not have a job? What are you doing here? Okay, I know it's risky. It's just, I have no other way to reach him. I can't go to the warehouse. He doesn't have a phone, no e-mail. Yeah, no Twitter, either. You know why? He can't have any followers. Everyone needs to believe he's dead, or he will be for real. Okay, it's just, we said that we'd be in touch, and I haven't heard from him in, like, a week, so... What? He hasn't called? You know they say if you haven't heard from him in three days, he's just not that into you. JT, I... I'd move on. Do you not understand what's going on here? He is a genetically-altered... killing machine... That is why I'm here. You're not the only one who worries about him, okay? I hadn't heard from him. I just wanted to make sure that he's okay. He's fine. Okay. Why are you still standing here? (sighs) Can you just give this to him? "How are you?" You risked this for a "how are you?" Just sign all of our death certificates, "How are you?" ♪ 
♪ Always thought you could be more like me ♪ 
♪ More like me... Heather : Maybe next, we should break in the... kitchen. Catherine : Heather. And... you are  not  Brian. Josh. Josh. Josh. Great digs. (laughs) Uh... yeah. Okay. What are you doing home? Uh, we are low on the assignment rotation, so I thought I'd get a workout in, which... you clearly did. (laughs) I am so sorry. No. No, it's okay. You're making yourself comfortable in your new apartment. Yeah. Speaking of, Dad wants to know who you're bringing to the wedding. He thinks you're not filling out the RSVP card because of the plus one. I am busy. It takes five seconds to lick the envelope. What about that cute medical examiner you work with? Evan? He is a total player. You like players. I do not like anyone right now. Just invite someone because Dad's freaked out. He thinks you're going to be alone forever. (phone ringing) It's work. I need to get in the shower. Can you make sure that Josh is not in it? (laughs) I'll tell Dad it's in the mail. (siren chirps) Catherine : I just walked in on my sister and a friend christening my apartment. Ooh, I'd charge extra rent for that. Not quite as salacious. Hit-and-run. Why is Joe here for a hit-and-run? Well, it looks like a homicide. Victim's Judge Hanson. The immigration judge? Yeah, they played squash together. Hanson helped Joe's housekeeper get her papers. Man : Hey, it's the Estrogen Squad. That's still as hilarious as the first ten times you said it, Wilansky. (sighs) Security cameras missed a direct visual. Law clerk caught the whole thing. The driver went straight for him, Lieutenant? then reversed back over. Thank you. Sounds personal. Personal and merciless and gross. Clerk got the plates. Car's registered to an Iris Sodkovic. She's a waitress at the Club Veraban. Sodkovic. Veraban. They both sound like they could have been cases of his. Sodkovic was. The judge just deported her brother three days ago. Oh, so maybe a little sisterly payback? Sounds like it. Address on the registration. We're on it. Uh, Wilansky and Boggs are point. Of course, we miss the high profile case. Nothing personal. They're up in the rotation. You two, back them up on the arrest. Blood and tissue along here. Engine's still warm. She must have just gotten home. Hey, we're gonna go around the back. Uh, we got this. Just call for an impound and sit tight. Can you believe I had to partner with that guy for two years? Strange to mow someone over with your own car and not even wipe the blood off the fender. Well, maybe Iris is inside getting a paper towel. It's Vargas. I need a tow and forensics team on standby. Hey, Tess, isn't that, uh...? You Iris Sodkovic? NYPD, stop! Tess : Stop! (grunting) Please, please. I have green card. You're under arrest for the murder of Judge Brian Hanson. What? He-He's dead? (horns honking) She said she has a green card. What? If she murdered a judge, why would she be worrying about that? Uh, I'd worry about having a green card, too. Prison in Bosnia probably makes prison here feel like a five-star resort. Yeah, but it seemed like she didn't even know he was dead. Look, as much as I'd like for Wilansky to actually have to work to close this thing, it feels like a slam dunk. Driver reversed over the judge. We assumed it was to finish the job, but maybe he knew there were cameras, and he wanted the plates seen so that he could frame Iris. Frame Iris? Cat, this is not our case. Even though we're the ones who took her down. I'm gonna remind him. Iris? I'm Detective Chandler. We sort of met earlier today. (door closes) Where were you at 4:00 this afternoon? Walking home. Was there anyone with you? No. Is there anyone who can corroborate? Was there a witness, someone who saw you? I... I can't. Why not? I can't help you if you don't talk to me. Okay. (siren wailing (rustling) Heather? Heather? (door creaking) JT : So you and Catherine have decided to keep in touch? Carefully. So now I'm your carrier pigeon, passing notes like I'm back in high school. (sighs) What? Apparently not tonight. She's here? So "carefully" means not careful at all. Got it. JT, come on. (knocking) Hey. Hey. I got your note. What note? You already wrote her back? Vincent, how do you know? I saw her. Where? When? Who? Around 4:00 on 123rd. 123rd-- that is her apartment. That's near school. But seriously, who are we talking about? A suspect in a case. That's what you're in touch about? You gonna start going on stakeouts? No. I saw Catherine arrest a woman who was innocent, okay. I thought she should know, that's it. Wait. You-you  saw  me arrest her? And earlier, at the school...? Have you been following me? After the attack last week, I've kept tabs, yeah. JT : Okay. We're all gonna die. I'm getting a Tums. Um... well, did you see what she was doing? She was walking, alone. Um, she had a paper bag. What was in it? Where-where was she going? I don't know, okay? I'm not Batman. I don't watch over the citizens of New York. No, it's just... it's frustrating. I had this feeling she was innocent, and now you've confirmed it. You're a witness, but you can't come forward. No, I can't, okay? I can't get involved. JT : Exactly, so stop writing notes. Thanks for the confirmation. ♪ Well, she's without ♪ 
♪ The money in paper ♪ 
♪ Sat around... ♪ (music stops) Autumn cleaning? Medical Examiners Association's paying me a visit. Turns out that my old assistant wasn't filing the paperwork the right way. Is it a big deal? Well, they've been known to bring down the hammer, send an M.E. off to-- what's the American version of Siberia? Well, I hope that doesn't happen. What would I do without you? I'm sure you'd survive. What's up? Uh, Hanson case. Did CSU's come in with any prints or hair or any odd personal items from the vehicle? Nope. Guess it's low-priority with the perp already in custody. But we're waiting for DNA results from the car. What about the autopsy on the judge? He was just here. Bloody mess. You know what two tons of steel can do to a man's insides? But now look-- so clean, you can see yourself. How about  seeing  anything that might suggest a different theory or suspect? Is this his stuff? What are you doing? I am dotting my I's and crossing my T's. Aren't they Wilansky's I's and T's? V&P Valet. 17 East 34th Street. That's the same block that Iris worked at. What are you thinking? Well... maybe Iris and the judge were connected by more than just her brother's deportation case. I take it you're not the pizza guy. Not that he would ever bring pizza in here. (Evan chuckles) (siren wailing in distance) Catherine :  Who was bartending two nights ago? Sam. He's right over there. What can I do for you? Your valet's not here yet. Do you guys use, uh... this company? We do. Do you recognize him? The judge who was recently murdered? Yeah, he's been in here a couple of times. He was murdered? Hit-and-run. The stub was in his pocket. Wow. Um... let me get the owner for you. Yo, Dane! Yeah? Up front! Please. You, uh, do you remember this guy? Yeah. It's, uh, Iris's guy. What about him? He's dead. And Iris is accused of murdering him. Were they in a... relationship? Uh... I don't know if you'd call it that. I mean... she worked him, but... Because of her brother's case? She couldn't get over the fact that she'd gotten a green card and he'd been denied. Hey, look, I don't want to get anyone into any trouble, but, uh, I did see him and Iris have an argument by the bathrooms a couple of nights ago. I don't know what it was about, but she was pissed. After her brother's ruling. Okay, so the press were all over the Hanson case, and I swear Wilansky got Botox'd just for photo ops. So, where are you, 'cause I'm about to puke. Yeah, don't do that. Thank you. I'll let myself out? I am at Iris's apartment. (whispers): What?! Wilansky will kill you if he finds out. I went by the club that she works at. Turns out her and Hanson were in a relationship. Okay, so now she has  two  motives to kill him: her brother's case or some lovers' quarrel. Or... maybe it's a third party. Maybe an ex-boyfriend or one of the judge's old girlfriends? This isn't our case. Yeah, but I don't think she did this. Why, 'cause she's a cute girl? You don't take her seriously as a criminal, just like Wilansky doesn't take us seriously as detectives. Tess, I am not the enemy. And... there's a men's extra large shirt in here. Judge Hanson wasn't an extra large. Wilansky's coming over to gloat. I got to go. Did you watch and learn? (muffled coughing in distance) (girl coughing) (gasps) It's okay, it's okay. I'm a police detective. You're safe. My name's Catherine. What's your names? (coughs) Do you speak English? M-My name is Cena. She's Mila. ♪ What now? (pants) Okay, I know you don't get involved, but I-I need your help, just this once. It's about the case, Iris... I'm not Batman, remember? You say that, but... those six cases I found of you saving people... Yeah, I go out at night sometimes. If I stumble across something, I will help out, but I don't go looking for it. Iris has two little sisters, and one of them is sick-- she can hardly breathe. So take her to the ER. They're here illegally. I take them to the ER, they'd get reported, they'd get sent home. I can't, okay? I can't be seen. I would be putting you, me and JT at risk. Okay, but you won't be seen, because they're in hiding, too. Vincent, please, you're a doctor. I  was  a doctor. I'm sorry. Do you remember what that was like? Helping people? Just this once. (siren wailing in distance) Catherine : Cena? Mila? It's Catherine. I brought a doctor to see you. It's okay. He's here to help. Um... I'm just gonna sit right here, okay? I need you to put this under your tongue. It's okay. It's okay, see? See? Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. Stethoscope. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna need her to lean forward. (speaks quietly) Okay. Deep breaths, okay? (Mila breathing steadily) (sighs) Okay. Thank you. Take this. (sighs) 103. I'm gonna have to get ahold of JT. 
 
 (phone beeps) You have a phone? Hey. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, look, listen, you got a pen? Okay, write this down before you react, okay? I'm gonna need a nebulizer, .05% albuterol. 100 milligrams cephalexin q.i.d. for ten days. Yeah, and... oral prednisone, 7.5 migs. Get them from the university lab, okay? There you are. Yeah. I just... Don't tell me you went to the impound, too. No. Wait, did you? Yeah, turned out MEA's quite thorough. They kicked me out of my own lab for the past eight hours, so with no place else to go... Did you look at Iris's car? No. I went to the impound to check out last year's models. Okay, did you find anything? Some dandruff, some dirt and 13 different sets of partials. That's a lot of people in her car. Well, she worked at a high-end club. She probably got valet service. But you know Iris confessed, right? She did  what? (door opens) Iris, why did you confess? Tomorrow is arraignment. The lawyer says plea is best. Ten years instead of life. Ten years?! You're innocent. I found your sisters. I know about Mila and Cena. What did you do with them? They're safe. No one else in my department knows about them. Mila was sick when I found her, but a doctor friend is taking care of her. They're who you were coming home to when the judge was killed, right? They're your alibi, but you can't tell anyone? If they come here, they will be put back to Bosnia. Probably killed. There is no alibi. I did it. I know you didn't. But whoever did knew you'd make a great suspect. Who knew about you and Judge Hanson? That we were friends? Your coworkers thought it was a little more than that. Who-- Dane? I never slept with the judge. I just make friends, trying to stop him from deporting my brother. How'd you know I was talking about Dane? We were together. I told him nothing was going on with the judge, but he didn't believe me. He was very angry. You think he did this? Which means you didn't. (door opens) I need you. I have a signed confession that's now tainted because a cop repeatedly spoke to a perp behind the back of counsel. Iris was confused. Cat, is there something that you're not telling us? I haven't found anything definitive yet. This fishing expedition ends here. You're home till further notice. Need your gun and badge. And, Vargas, you knew about this, too? She didn't do anything, Joe. Lieutenant. And she knew enough about what you did. Desk duty, rest of the month. You're both dismissed. Tess. I am so sorry. It's just, uh, Iris, she... You're still on this? Look, believe me, I wish Wilansky got this wrong, but this is how it works and these are the rules, so next time you decide to take a swan dive off the cliff, don't forget, you're dragging me with you. No, I know that, of course I do. Do you? 'Cause I know you carry a lot of baggage, Cat-- questions about your mom-- and you disappear inside yourself, and I get that, but lately you've been off the rails-- going to Iris's apartment without telling me, going M.I.A. for the night. I know for a fact that this woman is innocent, Tess, I do. You're suspended and I'm on desk duty. You need to drop this now. Vincent : Hey. (gasps) Shh. I didn't mean to scare you. You are lucky I don't have my gun. What happened? Are the girls okay? The day of the hit-and-run, the girls saw a man come into Iris's apartment and take her keys. What? They used Iris's car to kill the judge? Vincent :  Yeah, they said they couldn't see who he was through the vent, but they said he had  a knife in his arm. Probably meant hand. I wonder if it was her boss. They were a couple, but when I talked to him, he acted like she was just another employee. In fact, he was jealous of the judge. So you think he did this? Yeah, but there's nothing I can do about it. I'm suspended. I have no badge, I have no gun. I can't even get a warrant to find her keys, but I don't need one to get into Dane's club. Maybe I could find Iris's car keys. Wait, you're gonna go alone without your partner? I'll be fine. Hey, uh... thank you for coming through. ♪ I am titanium ♪

Needed a pen. (closes drawer) So it turns out that you're Iris's ex-boyfriend. Any reason you didn't mention that? Because I knew it would lead to this kind of BS, which isn't exactly great for business. I have two eyewitnesses that saw a man on Tuesday taking Iris's keys out of her apartment. I'm betting they'll recognize your face. The hell they will. I got 200 witnesses that confirm I was here all day Tuesday. So why don't you turn around? Let me watch you walk that skinny little ass the hell out of my club. Charming. ♪ I am titanium... (thunder crashing) Did you do this? Did you do this? I let you get away with a ton of crap. No, I'm not taking the fall. (grunts) Who was that on the phone?! (alarm chirps) You just called someone. Who was it? Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, God. He is fine. He does not look fine. What are you doing here? You said you didn't have a gun. I also said that I would take it from here. Look, he called someone after you left his office, okay? It was about the girls. It sounded like it was to whoever did this. So you thought you would beat the information out of him? This, this is why I don't get involved. You're right, I shouldn't have asked you, but you're the one who left me the note. So, what are you saying, that I shouldn't have? No, I just... I can't figure out how this is supposed to work. I can't go to your loft, but you can just show up at my work. I can't call you, but JT has your phone number. It's a burner for emergencies. Oh, my God. Tess was right. I have swan dived so far off the cliff. This guy is unconscious. I said he would be fine. And it is all on your terms, which means I'm alone in it. Yeah, well, join the club. Vincent :  Yeah, they said they couldn't see who he was  through the vent, but they said  he had a knife in his arm. He was murdered? Look. Thank you for the medical consult. Truly you saved that girl's life, but I've got to go by the book to see this through. I will take it from here. (phone ringing) (groaning) First of all, I am sorry. I will never treat you like a non-partner again. You could ditch me for a week and still be the best partner I ever had. All right, what's going on? Okay, you remember how Iris-- she didn't seem like she knew anything about the judge being murdered? That's because she didn't. She was going home to see her two little sisters. Why didn't she just say so? They're here illegally, she's got them in hiding. She thinks they're gonna get deported just like her brother did, and I think that they were smuggled here by Sam. Bartender guy? Yeah, and apparently coyote guy. In '09 he was brought up on charges of smuggling people in from Eastern Europe. Guess who the presiding judge was. Hanson. So this was some kind of retribution? More like insurance. So Sam panics. He sees Iris cozying up to the judge who almost put him away. He gets nervous that she's giving him up in order to get favorable treatment for her family, so he wants to shut them both up. He kills the judge and he frames Iris. And we prove this how? Sam's nasty bar spittoon. I snagged it from the club tonight. I'm banking that Evan will find DNA that matches one of the DNA samples found in the car. (phone ringing) Oh. Our warrant's working. This is Vargas. We've got the location of Sam's phone. 123rd. He's at Iris's apartment. He's going after the girls. We have to tell Joe. (soft breathing) (creaking) (yells) What the...? (muffled yelling) What the hell is going on? I thought she was suspended. Well, looks like you took down the wrong perp, Wilansky. All right, Unit One Charlie. One Charlie. Looking for? White male mid-20s, medium build, brown hair. Presumed armed, definitely dangerous. He might have two little girls as hostages. All right, let's move. Move. And remember the knife tattoo on his arm. Move. Go, go, go. You better be right. (phone ringing) Chandler. Hey. It's me. I got the guy who did this. What? Don't worry, he's conscious, okay? I'll hold him till you get here. Where are you? I'm at Iris's. JT has the girls. Okay. We're already here. You need to get out  now. (footsteps) Go, go, go! (panting) (siren wails) Go left! (police speaking indistinctly) Clear! (siren chirps) (panting) Hey, this place is empty. What's up? They must have heard us. They're somewhere in the building. All right, fan out! Let's go, let's go! Let's sweep the rest of the building! (growling) (grunts) (muffled shout) (growling) (muffled shouting) (growls) (muffled shouting) (Sam grunting) (growls) Catherine (panting) : Stop! He's out, he didn't see you! Vincent, stop! We need him alive. I prove that he's guilty, Iris goes free. Stop. Vincent. Vincent, those girls are okay because of you. You saved a child's life yesterday. Wilansky :  What the hell? How'd you disappear and suddenly have the guy? That's female energy for you. (engine starts) We placed the perp  in Iris's car  at the time of impact thanks to DNA material, which you asked Evan to test, even though it wasn't your case. We were backup. Which turned out to be chewing tobacco, which matched the chewing tobacco that you stole from a club that you entered without a warrant or a badge. Okay, but on the other hand, we tracked Sam to Iris's apartment with an actual warrant... Hold on. And based on protocol, with these infractions, she should be demoted... to garbage. Is that code for something? It's code for garbage. Come on, Joe, she broke the case. She broke a lot of rules, but on behalf of my friend Judge Hanson... I'm glad you did. But as head of this department, rule is... I got to give you desk duty. One week. (softly): Nice work. I spoke with a caseworker at the State Department. I explained to them that your sisters are key witnesses in a high-profile prosecution. He thinks we can get them asylum. I didn't want to expose them, Iris, truly, but... I didn't have a choice. You saved their lives. Not just me. (excited shouting) ♪

♪ Don't ask... (phone rings) Hey. How'd the inspection go? Are you celebrating? I believe I am, if drinking to excess in the privacy of my lab qualifies as a celebration. So, it went well? Everything was in order. No demerits. Inspector Man barely made eye contact with me as he left the door. You know, I didn't think I was nervous, yet I find myself flooded with relief. Me, too. Who would I rope in to my off-the-grid investigations if not you? Well, come any time. My door is always open. I went to the morgue. The samples were there. Just as you suspected. We'll understand more once these are analyzed, but... it's now confirmed-- Vincent Keller is very much alive. And Catherine Chandler is going to bring him to us. It's time to act. ♪

That you can... communicate or be in the outside world. I wish I was Batman, too. I just wish you were a normal guy. Ouch. That was not what I meant. Without all the baggage. Okay. What I am trying to say, badly, is that... I get it. In order to be in contact with you, it has to be on your terms. It's just... you know, it's hard. But I'd like to make it work.

You can't go there. Unless it is a dire emergency. How am I supposed to know what qualifies as a dire emergency? You call me and you ask. (chuckles) Don't get too excited.
