 Catherine :  Nine years ago I witnessed my mother's murder. 
 I would've been killed, too, if it hadn't been for Vincent. Vincent :  I was part of an experimental special forces group. There goal was to create the perfect super soldier. But something went wrong. You're him. Vincent :  Muirfield is still out there,  and they want me dead. I have evidence that a cross-species creature exists. I could do with the help of a biochemist. And I was hoping that it'd be the man who published a paper on it. Catherine :  My nurse, Alex Salter,  you might know her. We grew up together. We were pretty close. Alex :  I used to fantasize about leaving New York  and never coming back. The sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can start living. I want to be with you, Vincent. Alex is willing to give up her life to go with me. ♪ 
♪ 'Cause you're not welcome anymore ♪ Oh, how about screw him? You said yourself, he chose the other woman. He didn't really choose her, he chose the things that come along with her. Which makes him an ass. You're moving on. Cold Turkey. Let's sing. He is an ass, isn't he? She has no idea what she's getting into with him. What is she getting into? You know, he's got issues. Well, what kind of issues? ♪ I'll survive ♪ 
♪ I will survive ♪ 
♪ Hey, hey. Man : Thank you, Heather. Up next, Tara with "Safety Dance." Okay, why was that just a solo? Cat's guy's got issues. What guy doesn't? He's not married, is he? No, that is your problem. You're married? No, and we're no talking about me right now. And now you really have to tell me. Okay, he's got... (clears throat) he's got some form of PTSD. What, like flashbacks? No, more like a bad temper. Not-not toward me. Tess : What? Okay, Cat, I thought you said you were done with bad boys. He's not a bad boy, he is sweet and heroic and... Apparently abusive. It is not like that at all. We just had this really deep connection and he understands me like no one else. What happened to "he's an ass"? Yeah, and do you not think we understand you? Let that other girl deal with his issues. She doesn't even know his issues. You know what I think? You should tell her. Yeah, I am so not going to do that. Heather : What? Why? Because it's spiteful, vengeful, vindictive? And you're afraid he'd hate you forever. Yeah, see, we understand you. You're still hanging on. No. You did just call him heroic. Okay, maybe I'm hanging on a little. But I am not telling her. Besides, I am moving on, cold turkey. It is over, done, finito. Okay, well here's to "I am woman, hear me drink." All Together : Cheers. Woman (on TV) :  Things are not as they seem. (gunshot on TV) Interview the neighbor. Okay, I know this is therapeutic for you, but these shows freak me out. Could you just turn it down a little? I mean, even the narrators voice is creepy. (knock on door) Maybe it's the neighbor. (feigns laugh) You know, if that's Ass, you're not letting him in. It's not him. He doesn't knock. (knocking continues) Who is it? Alex Salter. What? Um, nothing. Just-just work. Coming. It's fine, all good. Okay, well, hey, don't finish that ice cream. You'll regret it in the morning. (sighs) Hey. Sorry, it's so late. I just got done with my shift and you're on my way home. No, I was up, so... (gunshot on TV) Uh, that would be research for a case. How did you get my address? Uh, from your hospital file. Hope that's okay. Uh, no, that's fine. That's my sister's. Um, so, what's up? Well, I wanted to ask if it would be okay to take Vincent away for the weekend? Uh... Because I know about his work in Special-Ops. And that people have it out for him. Okay, so, he told you about... things. I hope that's okay. I mean, we were engaged once. No, no, no, no, that's good. Um, so did he tell you anything else? You know, besides the fact that people are after him? Uh, you mean that everyone is supposed to think he's dead? Is there more? Nope, that-that seems like plenty. Yeah, and I'm still not really clear what the rules are, which is why I'm here. Before I brought up this whole cabin idea to him, because you're his handler... Ah, you thought that you would check in with me first. Yeah. I mean it'd-it'd just be one night. My family has a cabin upstate. It's totally isolated. It would just be the two of us. Sounds fun. Oh, my God. It was out favorite place. You know, before. And we have a lot to... catch up on. Yeah, like your plans to move to Africa. So, he talked to you, too. I am his handler. (awkward laugh) It's just... strange. I've, uh, never had to share him before. No. No, you're not sharing him. Uh, in fact, in the future, you should probably go to him with all of these sorts of things; these weekend away kinds of things. You know, anything actually. Great. Yeah. All right, I'll just leave you to your work. Have fun at the cabin. Thanks. (door opens, closes) ♪ Found a thread to pull ♪ 
♪ And we can watch it unravel... ♪ Hey. If you're auditioning jogging buddies, I don't want the part. I came to apologize. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. About? That Alex showed up to your place, that she asked permission to... Go on a romantic weekend together? Look, uh, it's not just going to be about some romantic weekend away. So, you're going. Yeah, I'm-I'm thinking about it. Look, I don't want to hurt you, okay? But Alex and I, we've got so much to talk about. You're mad. You can sense that? Catherine, this isn't about her over you, okay? Right, it is about your future. Yeah, one where I don't have to hide all the time, where I might actually get to practice medicine again. In her parents' cabin? You think this is crazy. What if you lose control? Alex sees you, she freaks out, calls the cops. And what about her safety? I'm not going to hurt her. Just the idea of you going anywhere with someone who doesn't know who you are. Who I am? It's not what I meant. It's what you said. Vincent, what are you even doing here? I don't know. I-I thought that maybe I should... What, get my blessing? Because I am not actually your handler. I wanted to make sure you're fine with all this. You know, maybe get your opinion. My opinion is that I am cold turkey. What? Go, don't go, tell her, don't tell her... Well, I am going to tell her. Fine by me. Okay, then. Well, this has been helpful. Good. (sighs) ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x12 ♪ Cold Turkey 
Original Air Date on February 7, 2013 Tess :  So, how are you today? How we doing? Today's a new day. Hello? I think I sent him into a cabin in the woods with her. What? Yeah, he came to see me thing morning. I was trying to be all tough and cold turkey and I made him run in the other direction. Made him? I don't, I think he was wavering. Maybe I should call him and tell him not to go. No, no, no, no phone. We're going to focus on work. All right, pick a case. Uh, missing octogenarian, prescription drug ring at New York General, stolen jewelry from Tiffany's... Wait, New York General? Uh, yeah, Narcotics has warrants on a bunch of people, mostly nurses. You're kidding. All right, all raids start at noon. They don't want anyone tipped off. Okay, well, (clears throat) let's raid her. Her apartment is right near my favorite ice cream shop. Done. Um, I will meet you there. I just have an errand to run, okay? You're gonna call him. (phone line ringing) Pick up, pick up, come on. (door closes, sighs) (phone line ringing) JT, I need to talk to Vincent. We're about to raid his girlfriend's apartment. We are? Who's "we"? (sighs) Narcotics. Alex has been stealing meds from the hospital to use at her clinic. They have a warrant. They left for the cabin already. What? If his prints show up in the system again... You know, if you really wanted to protect him, you should've told him not to go. I am not his handler. And you could've done the same thing. I tried. Meanwhile, I am protecting him. You know your little pal Evan is 12 hours away from presenting his cross-species DNA findings to the National Genetics Association. Okay, we are going to do this raid in 49 minutes. Vincent's not picking up his burner. Do you have Alex's number? No, and there is no cell phone reception up at the cabin. Where does she live? I'll go. Yeah, and leave your fingerprints all over that place? No. I've already been there and I know where all of the mementos and letters are. You sure you want to do that? Want to?

I swear, every time I'm on this highway, I crave a strawberry milkshake. Well, we can stop if you want. Is that allowed? Yeah. You don't have to clear that with my handler. Oh, no, should I not have? No, it's fine. There's probably some things we should talk about if, you know, we're gonna move forward. "If"? Sorry, when. When. (chuckles): Yeah, I know, I know. There's so much that I have to figure out. When I'm gonna give work two weeks notice, what I'm gonna do with my apartment. But you're not talking about my logistics, are you? Uh, no, not exactly. It's just... What? Watch the road, the road. What? Watch the road. Sorry. I hate driving. I don't get to look at you. (clears throat) Okay, talk to me. Okay, uh, what about the flight? The flight? Yeah, it's not just a passport issue. I mean, there's cameras and security and dogs. There are sick people everywhere. We could go somewhere we could drive to. Central America, Mexico. You know how much I love margaritas. Yes, I do. (chuckles) All right, let's just start with a milkshake. I'll never say no to a milkshake. Watch the road. Road, right, right. Nothing so far. She has pill bottles in the bathroom, but they all have legit prescriptions. Oh, well, next raid. But I found this. New lingerie. Maybe she has a boyfriend. Or maybe she bought herself some new bras? Not according to the receipt. Maybe he's an ass, too, and look, if he's in on the drug thefts, she could hide the stash at his place. It just... it seems like a bit of a stretch. Yeah, but if we could just find out who he is... Okay, you're right. You check the kitchen; I'll finish up here, and whoever finds something last has to buy ice cream. How about cocktails? Done. (sighs) It's a bug. I can see that. You can speak; I disabled it. What the hell was a bug doing in her apartment? Obviously, Muirfield's back. But how did they get onto... Vincent attacked Alex's stalker. His DNA was probably on the body. Okay, Evan cannot present today. Evan? JT, Muirfield might have heard that Alex was going away to a remote cabin with Vincent. You better get up there. Me? No, no, no, no. I-I am not walking into their little... I can't do it. I have to figure out a way to stop Evan before he stands up in front of 200 people and presents Vincent's DNA reports to the world. Okay, but I already cleaned her apartment, and there was lingerie. So you're not gonna save him because he's with another girl because you told him it was a good idea? I did not tell him it was a good idea. I-I am supposed to be moving on. I was trying to take the high road. How about taking the Long Island Expressway, exit 91. There was a small engagement party there. Seriously? I'm sorry. I know how hard this is. I just hope they have their clothes on when I get there. Alex : Is it like you remember? Yeah, actually, it is. You sound surprised. (sighs) Feels like it's even colder in here than it is out there. Yeah, I'll get the fire going, huh? Okay. My parents left champagne. I-I don't really drink anymore. Oh, it's healthier. Yeah. Besides, it's too cold for champagne. Oh. Looks like it might snow outside. No snow in Mexico. So how's your Spanish? Uh, it's pretty rusty. Look, Alex, uh... before we start laying down all these plans, um, I need to finish what I was trying to say before. Okay. Uh... There's a reason why I've been in hiding. Are you worried I'm gonna reveal your identity? Because someone could try to beat it out of me. I wouldn't say a word. Alex, it's about your safety. I know people are after you. I mean, that's why we're going halfway around the world or to Mexico, to leave it all behind. Some of it we can't leave behind. Hey, I... I know there are risks, but I'm an E.R. nurse in New York City. Nothing freaks me out. Vincent. I'm in. I'm gonna make dinner. Okay. 
 
 (sighs) (phone rings, beeps) Hi. Get your errand done? Yeah, just on my way to New York General to follow up. No, Narcotics is already on it. Oh, and the boyfriend's a dead end. Oh, good. I mean, just now we can have some more down time. You sound weird. Is it the guy? Uh, kind of. All right, that's it. I'm cancelling my plans with Mr. Married. You and I are hanging out. No, no, no, Tess, it's okay. I just really need some time alone right now. All right, well, whatever you do, don't call, um... I don't even know his name. At this point, why bother? Is it okay? Yeah, it's great. Well, that's good, 'cause it's still only one of three dishes that I actually know how to make. You sure you can't have some wine? I was part of a... experiment in the military. Okay. It's just that, uh... Well, it didn't go as planned, and that's what I needed to tell you.at, uh... So-so what, do you have post-traumatic stress or... Uh, no. It-it's more complicated. Um, I am more complicated. You're not. Maybe your circumstances are, but I know you. No, you don't. You don't. I'm, uh, starting to feel like you don't want to do this. I do. Then what? Does your handler not think it's a good idea? Alex, I told you, it-it's complicated. No, you said you were complicated. I don't know; look, I'm just... I'm trying to do the right thing here, and I just... I want you to know what you're getting into. Vince, I told you, I'm in. Look, people fantasize about leaving their lives all the time. We actually get to do it. Go where nobody knows us. Start a clinic. Help people. I guess I could have virgin margaritas. What? Shh. Wait here. Whoa. Man : Hey. I guess you saw me coming. Yeah, uh... (chuckles) What's going on? I'm really sorry to bother you. It's just... my truck broke down, (distantly): and I'm completely useless when it comes to this kind of thing-- I don't know a lug nut from a... I don't even know. There's no cell service around here. Tell me about it. Oh, where's your truck? A mile up the road, maybe. About to give up when I saw the lights. Can I, uh, take your car? Oh, of course. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. It's starting to get really cold out here. Be right back, okay? Okay. JT. Justin Timberlake, huh? I get that all the time. (whispering): We need to talk. No, I don't need the DNA. I'm just gonna present the cross... Cross-training. I'm in, dude. I'll buy you a soda, and we'll talk all about it. Please tell me "buying a sod"" isn't a euphemism for something. Yeah, for "your morgue is potentially bugged." You have to stop. No more samples, no more, uh, analysis, no presentations. I have to do that presentation to get our grant. Forget the grant. Okay, I didn't want to have to tell you, but... there's a secret organization that's obsessed with the same creature you've been studying. A secret organization? Yes, and they will stop at nothing to keep others from finding too much out. ♪ Dunh-dunh-dunh. I'm serious. You need to walk away now. Or what, some science nerd's gonna beat me up, make sure that I don't get the grant first? They've spent billions and billions of dollars developing genetic weapons. And at any rate, who knows? Maybe this is something they've created and they're just trying to cover their tracks? There is way more at stake than some measly grant. And you know this how? I just do. You just do? Right. Look, I know this sounds crazy, and-and I have no proof, but... You know, my first set of samples was stolen, my second was corrupted. I'm starting to think that I've got a frustrated competitor working to derail my efforts so he can get his own recognition. Wait, you think that I...? Okay, you have trust issues, buddy. Me, Mr. "Secret Organization"? You know what, I'm gonna go work on my preparation and my measly grant. Alex : Vincent? No, it's Catherine. Chandler. I'm sorry, I tried calling. What are you doing here? I'm looking for Vincent. It's urgent. He's not here right now. You want to come in? It's freezing. Where is he? Is there something going on between you two? Alex, that's not what this is about. That wasn't a "no"" I just need you to tell me where he is. He just went to help some guy with his truck. He'll be back. What guy? When was this? You just missed them. He'll be right back. Okay, what direction did they go in? I didn't notice. What-what's going on? Is he in trouble? He might be-- that guy could have been a trap. A trap? No. He seemed totally harmless. And how would anyone even know that we're here? There was a listening device in your apartment. A what? Alex, he has a handler for a reason. There are people that are tracking him. You told me it was okay to take him away. Because it wasn't my decision to make, it was his. But he could've been more clear with you. No, he has been clear, and I've dealt with PTSD before. PTSD? Alex, I'm sorry, but I have gotta go find him. Well, I'm coming with you. No, he left you here for a reason. But if he's in trouble... You are staying here! He is protecting you in more ways than you know. Here, take this. If anyone gets close to you, use it. Man : It's been making  a weird noise for weeks. I should've taken it in. I just kept putting it off. Hey, what are we doing? The truck's up... Hey! How many? I don't know what you're talking about. Benny's Garage? Grease under your nails. If your truck was really broken down, you'd know how to fix it, right? Seriously, man, all I know is that I was supposed to meet my girlfriend an hour ago. How many? Dude, I don't... (gasping) Three. What did they tell you? To get you to the truck. And then? They'd take it from there. They gave me a thousand bucks. Told me they were bounty hunters. I need the money. They're not bounty hunters, and they don't like witnesses, so I'd start running. What about my truck? Forget your truck. Just get as far away from here as you can. This cloak-and-dagger bit's wearing thin. Lila Burrows. Who? 22-year-old female, blood clot, ended up dying on your table? Surprised you don't remember her, considering she's the reason you left England. Records are sealed, but when you're being tracked by a secret organization, you acquire basic hacking skills. I was cleared of everything. Legally, but seems your conscience couldn't take it. You left six weeks after the suit was filed. You even changed specialties. No tragic loss of life in a morgue. What's your point? That this is something you don't want people to know, and I'll make sure they do, unless... You're blackmailing me? I'm trying to save your life. I'm not asking for money, just for you to find something else to research. Or what? You're gonna go running around the precinct spreading gossip? Those people are busy solving actual crimes. This partnership, it's over. (breathing heavily) ♪ (twig snaps) (grunts) It's clear. What are you doing here? I found a bug at Alex's. What? Narcotics did a raid because of her clinic. You shouldn't be here, Catherine, it's dangerous. So dangerous, you leave your fiancée alone? I'm trying to keep it away from her. Keep what away? Whatever's out there, or the fact that you might transform? You can't help it, can you? Every interaction we have, you have to constantly remind... Every interaction? Yes. The other day in the park, you said yourself, it's who I am. You know that's not what I meant. What about your dad's wedding? You know, I show up, we had one dance, you tell me to leave. I had just found out you were mutating. No, my DNA was mutating, not me. And then I came after you. Vincent, from the first moment I met you, I have seen you as a person, and you know it. This is your issue, it's not mine. I told Alex about the experiment, okay? Yeah, she thinks you have PTSD. That's the cover story I told my girlfriends over karaoke. It's not a bad thing when someone knows the darkest parts of you. (footsteps) They're here. How many? Three. Come on. Okay. (gunshots) Get down! (gasps) (Vincent growling) (growls) (gasps) (growls) (gasps) (growls) (neck snaps) (low snarl) (panting) I retract what I said before. I'm glad you were here. I get that you want a different kind of life. Yeah, but even though I try and get away, they still find me. Vincent, I didn't want you to have to hide from Muirfield  and  her. Wait. What? Alex... (gasps) Stay away. Alex, it's okay. I saw you. I saw everything. Okay, just let me explain. Okay. Alex... Alex, put the gun down. What you saw, that isn't who he is. He's the same guy you've always known. No. Trust me. Put the gun down. Come on, Alex, put it down. (sobbing) (crying) It's okay. Okay, I'll be at the car. The experiment that I told you about... Alex, they changed my DNA. You ripped those men apart. Please, I would never hurt you. Okay. I guess you know now why I stayed away all those years. Is it permanent? I've been trying to find a cure. But, uh... Alex, I'm sorry. Okay, I-I just wanted to go away with you. You know, somewhere peaceful where we could help people. You know, I thought... I just thought it wouldn't happen. I can't. We can't. I guess I got caught up in a fantasy. I'm going to... drive myself home. Yeah. You are so busted. You were with Ass, weren't you? Oh, my God, what happened? (sighs) What happened... is he needed me. Cat... No. No, I'm talking life and death. Oh, my God. Seriously? Is he okay? Yeah, he's... he's okay. For now. Cold turkey's so hard. Yeah, I know I am supposed to be... strong and move on, but... But maybe being strong is following your heart no matter what? Just my own little theory. I won't tell Tess. Tess might actually like the theory. She's been calling all night. Some guy blew her off. Oh, no. Yeah, maybe you could bring over your leftover pint of ice cream. I so do not want that in our freezer. (chuckles) Actually, I have a better idea. JT : What do you mean you let Alex go? You think holding her hostage was going to help the situation? What if she tells someone? I-I mean, the cops searched her apartment. They're going to want to talk to her. You're right. While you were frolicking in the woods, the cops got a warrant. Somebody noticed all the medication Alex has been stealing for the clinic. My prints... Catherine got rid of any trace. (sighs) Oh, man. I am such an ass. Can't say I'm going to argue with you there. (sighs) (phone ringing) Ah, get it, I got to go. Didn't expect to hear from you. I didn't expect to call, but I found a bug in my office. I'm assuming not a cockroach? I ran it for prints; they're classified, the prints. Not to mention this is no low-tech, inexpensive device. Look, uh, I'm not going to lie to you, it's not great. It means you're on their radar. But... bright side, now you can take precautions, protect yourself. Well, I canceled the presentation. There goes your grant. Our grant. About that blackmail thing... I was just trying to get my message across. I don't want anyone to know. But since you do... I send her family a check every month. But you weren't found guilty. Doesn't mean I don't feel it. We all have skeletons. Care to elaborate? No. Point is, whatever happened, it's none of my business. Forget I ever mentioned it. Thank you. (knocks on glass) Hey. I'm actually just heading out. Oh, this won't be long. Um, I just... I need to say thank you. For what? For this? Your photos and letters from Alex's apartment. You know, I keep trying to move on, but it's kind of difficult with you. I don't want you to. Catherine, the things that I said about the way that you see me, it was wrong, okay? It's my issue. I just, sometimes I wish so badly... I wasn't what I am. Catherine, I know that I can't be with someone who doesn't know everything about me. She does now. Okay, who doesn't accept everything about me. Vincent, I can't be your second choice. You're not. Really? Because if Alex had accepted you, you... you'd be with her right now. In that ridiculously romantic cabin. Not happily. It was never about... taking off with Alex. It was about a better future for me, okay? But I know now that that better future isn't her, Catherine. It's you. I will do whatever it takes to make this right. Vincent, there's nothing you can do. Obviously now that Muirfield's back and Alex knows, I will help, but... But you and me... I need to protect myself right now. Heather : Cat, come on. And I need to be there for someone who's always there for me. Of course. Hey. I'm not going anywhere, okay? Tess :  I'm telling you, I'm the worst singer in the world. (moaning) It didn't stop you last time, come on. And, seriously, I am not doing this by myself again. Tess : Fine, what did you request? Catherine : That you and I stay away from asses. It's not going to be easy-- he already texted. Don't text him back. What am I saying, text him, don't text him, just know that if he breaks your heart again, I'm here. I'm not heartbroken. Back at you. (music begins playing) It's starting. Mm, nice choice. ♪ Don't go breaking my heart ♪
