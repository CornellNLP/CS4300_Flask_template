 Previously on  Beauty & the Beast... 
 (woman screams) 
 Dad! 
 There was no match between Catherine's blood and your father. 
 (growls) 
 Vincent! 
 Don't shoot. She's my daughter. 
 Vincent! 
 It's okay. It's over. 
 All that matters is that you're back safe. 
 I never stopped looking for you. 
 Who are you? 
 Aren't you a little concerned about what Muirfield did to Vincent? 
 He's a little scary. 
 Vincent would never hurt me. 
 Cat, you said yourself he doesn't remember you. 
 (growls) 
 There are more of them out there. 
 Who pays for that boat? 
 Is someone controlling you? 
 I don't even know who you are! 
 (gasps) 
 (growls) 
 (gasping) 
 (distant phone rings) 
 (phone beeps) 
 Hey, it's Cat. 
 I think I have an idea about how to deal with this whole Vincent situation. 
 Just got one little hitch. 
 I can be there in 20 minutes. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 Woman : Morning! 
 Heathe? 
 Hey, I was just trying to catch you before work. 
 Uh, yeah, just give me two seconds. 
 All right. No worries. 
 I brought coffee. 
 (sighs) 
 Hi! I am so sorry I haven't called you back. 
 I know you wanted to talk, so... 
 No, don't worry about it. 
 You've been super busy, and it's not like I've been around either. 
 I haven't slept in my bed in weeks. 
 Hey, is something wrong with your neck? 
 Uh, nope, just slept on it funny. 
 You know, I get it, you've been helping with Dad's house, and-and Brooke, and you are so the better daughter. 
 No. I'm the unemployed daughter. 
 But, um, that maybe is about to change. 
 What, you got a job? 
 Senior event coordinator at QMK. 
 It's one of the top PR firms in the country. 
 Wow. That is amazing. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 It, um, it's in Miami. 
 Okay, maybe a little less amazing. 
 But you know what? 
 I haven't decided if I'm gonna take it yet. 
 I mean, we just lost Dad, and, um, they need me to let them know by tomorrow. 
 You need advice? 
 Yeah, and to talk about stuff. 
 Okay, well, I have to meet my boss this morning, but let's get together later, have a coffee, and we can make a pros and cons list. 
 Yeah. And, um, chat about life... and Dad. 
 Totally. 
 We will figure it out. 
 Yeah. 
 What...? 
 Uh, initially, yes, and then I got this deep tissue massage that was probably too deep. 
 You think, you think I need a scarf? 
 Yeah, people are gonna think you have an abusive boyfriend. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, okay. 
 Thank you. 
 (jump rope whirring) 
 Hey. 
 Vincent, hey. 
 Hey. I'm-I'm sorry, but I knocked. 
 Oh, uh, it's okay, this is where you live... or lived. 
 Uh, keeps me motivated. 
 The beat, not the lyrics. 
 Have you seen Catherine anywhere? 
 Do you know if she's okay? 
 Oh, she's great. 
 Happy to have you back. 
 We-We both are. 
 Look, if-if you're sensing any weirdness on her part, it's probably just that she wants you to remember, and I know that's a lot of pressure, but... 
 Yeah. Look, could you just tell her that I'm sorry? 
 Don't apologize. 
 It's like head trauma; these things take a while. 
 But I can fill in some blanks for you, you know? 
 Relationship highlights. 
 No. No, that's... 
 Just so you're familiar with the facts. 
 I'm not expecting to jog anything, so, uh, you crashed her dad's wedding. 
 That was a big moment. 
 Uh, oh, and the hotel pool. 
 We thought we'd cured you, so you two went to the Ashcroft and got swimsuits at the gift shop. 
 But, I-I know cause it was on my credit card, but you don't have to pay me back. 
 I hurt her. 
 Physically? 
 She was... asking questions, things that I can't talk about. 
 And I got, I got frustrated, and I got overwhelmed. 
 I just, I felt cornered. 
 But she's okay, right? 
 She seemed to be fine, but... 
 But what? 
 If I can't tell her... 
 I feel terrible about it, okay? 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Could you just tell her that it'll never happen again and I will stay away? 
 It's just... after everything you two have been through, I don't know if that'll be what she wants. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I don't want to hurt her and I can't tell her the truth, so... just please check on her. 
 (phone rings) 
 Condor? 
 You at your computer? 
 No, I'm heading there now. 
 I found another target, but I may have been exposed. 
 That's why I'm calling you first. 
 I'm sending you the details right now. 
 It's not much, but if you... 
 (gasps) 
 Sir? 
 What the...? 
 (glass breaks) 
 Agent Tucker, are you there? 
 (blow lands, gasps) 
 The final seconds can be unbearable or peaceful, your choice. 
 (thud, squish, Tucker screams) 
 Tell me how you found me. 
 Screw you! 
 Who is this? 
 (phone beeps) 
 So, how are you? 
 Obviously, I've been better. 
 I'm wearing a non-regulation scarf. 
 Right. Sorry. 
 It's just that he's never done anything like this before. 
 We both know that someone's controlling him, but when I came at him with questions... 
 No, of course not, but this isn't exactly a domestic violence case. 
 Vincent is more of a victim than anyone. 
 But this isn't just about him anymore, it's about the public. 
 You told me yourself that Muirfield made beasts for profit. 
 We already know that they sold one, which means they probably sold others. 
 There could be metaphorical scarves everywhere. 
 And I can't just be direct and ask him about it, clearly. 
 Right. 
 So you said you had an idea? 
 You were on Vincent's houseboat, you saw the sat-phone and the computer. Those things, they hold answers, or at least leads to whoever's pulling his strings, so we can cut them. 
 You want to sneak on his boat? 
 Man : I'm sorry. 
 He's a super-charged beast with hyper senses. 
 What if he catches us? 
 That's just it, it shouldn't be "us". 
 You and Tess should be backup, then I can go in there. 
 And if he catches me, I can just say I came by to say hi. 
 Hi? That's your big idea? 
 You are so literal. I would obviously come up with something better, like, "I'm here to talk about our relationship." 
 Vincent and I were just together romantically. 
 But I am offering to use our relationship to our advantage. 
 I would pretend to still be pursuing him, when in reality, we'd be investigating to find out who's doing this to him. 
 Okay, on the phone you said there was a hitch. 
 Is there one, other than the obvious? 
 Yeah. He can sense when someone isn't being honest. 
 That's a pretty big hitch when you're talking about basically going undercover. 
 Maybe there's a way around it. 
 (phone rings) 
 I still care about him, that's honest. 
 It's Tess. 
 Okay, she doesn't know about... 
 Just, she already has problems with Vincent... 
 It's not my story to tell. 
 I get that I can't be with him, but I just can't hear it from her. 
 Catherine, I'm gonna answer the phone now. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, you have both of us. 
 You find anything? 
 It looks like we may have another beast attack. 
 ♪ Beauty and the Beast 2x02 ♪ 
 Liar, Liar 
Original Air Date on October 21, 2013 
 Body was discovered about a half hour ago. 
 I heard them describing the victim's wound on Dispatch, so I jumped on it. 
 Gabe : We know who he is? 
 There's no wallet, no phone, but the car's registered to the FBI. 
 FBI? We need to get hold of that security footage before anyone else does. 
 You think this was Vincent? 
 No way. He kills bad guys, not government officials. 
 We don't know that yet. 
 Gabe... 
 I don't want to hear about that boat. 
 Whose boat, Vincent's? 
 You just said this wasn't him. 
 Your partner wants to go undercover, pretend she's his girlfriend, even though she is his girlfriend, even though he doesn't remember that. 
 To find out who's controlling him. 
 We've got a dead FBI guy, and you're still on saving your boyfriend? 
 I'm on protecting the public. 
 Whatever's going on with Vincent,  Man : Detectives. 
 Special Agent Reynolds. 
 I heard you might have one of ours. 
 Actually, we don't have an I.D. yet. 
 Well, then why don't you fill me in on what you do know? 
 Agent Reynolds, Catherine Chandler. We met before. 
 Thomas' daughter? 
 Right. 
 At your dad's tribute. 
 Another morbid occasion. Uh, but if you give me your card, I will happily keep you updated on our investigation. 
 Actually, I think we're gonna take this over from here. 
 I hate to seem territorial, but this hasn't been ruled a federal investigation yet, so... 
 (phone rings) 
 Excuse me a minute. 
 Well, who is it that rules...? 
 JT, this isn't a good time. 
 Listen, if Vincent ever does something like this, you need to call me ASAP. 
 Wait-- so he  did  kill an FBI agent? 
 What? No. 
 I-I mean, I don't know. 
 I'm talking about what he did to you. 
 He was just here. 
 First, I thought he felt guilty 'cause he doesn't remember you, so I gave him the Cliff Notes version of your relationship. 
 Okay, hold on one second. 
 When was this? 
 Uh, like, an hour ago. 
 Tess! 
 Do we have a time of death? 
 45 minutes ago. 
 I'll call you back. 
 JT just alibied Vincent out, so it was another one. 
 I don't know if I'm relieved or disturbed. 
 I'm not saying that Vincent's laptop wouldn't be helpful right now, but he is a human polygraph. 
 Tess, you know those party tricks you used to do where you taught people how to cheat them? 
 I need you to teach me. 
 Sweating's the key indicator of lying. 
 So we're blocking the sweat glands. 
 Isn't he going to smell this? 
 Gabe : It's not deodorant. 
 It's antiperspirant. 
 Okay, this can't be good for my skin. 
 Put this in your shoe. 
 Okay. 
 Ow. 
 Pain raises your vitals. 
 So does lying. 
 We need to get you to keep your heart rate and your blood pressure the same when you're lying and when you're not. 
 Okay, so I press on the tack when I'm telling the truth. 
 But not when I'm lying. 
 Yes. 
 Okay, let's start with something we all know is true. 
 Do you like ice cream? 
 Yes. 
 And you're pushing on the pin? 
 Yes. 
 Now we have a baseline. 
 She's good at this. 
 Then again, you've had to lie on account of Vincent for over a year, so.... 
 All right, next question. 
 What's with the scarf? 
 I've been wondering all day. 
 I got a hickey. 
 No change. 
 A hickey? 
 Oh, my God, so we are doing all this to save your boyfriend. 
 No, this is before I realized that he has too much baggage right now. 
 Whatever, she passed. 
 She did? What was the lie? 
 I don't like ice cream. 
 Okay... let's get her on that boat. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Condor. 
 We have a situation. 
 Is it Tucker? 
 I was on the phone with him when it happened. 
 And I think the new target did it, sir. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I heard him ask Tucker how he'd found him. 
 Who is this guy? 
 Could be one of a few. 
 Tucker's job was to identify them and report to me, which he failed to do. 
 Well, he tried to get an e-mail out. 
 All I've got so far is "Friday at 5:00, it's a..." 
 Is a what? 
 I'm still trying to access more from the file, sir. 
 No time. 
 Get to the crime scene. 
 Figure out what beast we're up against. 
 If it was on to Tucker, it won't be long till it's on to us. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 You must be the one he was going to send after me. 
 Why don't you come out and introduce yourself in person? 
 Aw, but this is so much more fun. 
 Well, I don't play games. 
 It's not a game. 
 It's magic. 
 And I know all your tricks. 
 Listening for my heartbeat? 
 Ba-bum... ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum. 
 (laughing) 
 So what's happening Friday at 5:00? 
 Try and stop me. 
 I'll make sure you're crossed off that list sooner than anyone intended. 
 You don't know about the list, do you? 
 I'd be careful if I were you. 
 (siren chirps) 
 Are you here? 
 I just came to talk about our relationship. 
 Tess : Don't volunteer information. 
 I'm just practicing. 
 How are my vitals? 
 Elevated but stable. 
 That's because I have a tack in my shoe. 
 His laptop's open to an e-mail that was sent at the time of the murder. 
 There seems to be an attachment. 
 It looks coded. 
 Tess : He's coming. 
 I'm downloading the file right now. 
 No, no, no, forget the file. 
 He's moving fast, and he looks pissed. 
 Her pressure just went through the roof. 
 Got it. 
 (door opens) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 How did you, uh...? 
 The door was unlocked. 
 Look, um... 
 I'm-I'm so sorry about what... 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I just came to talk about our relationship. 
 Good. Great. 
 Uh, can I get you a water? 
 At least she's not over-talking. 
 What? 
 What? 
 I thought you just... you said something else. 
 Did I? My-my thoughts are just swirling in my head. 
 Yeah, of course they are. 
 Look, I'm sorry, I just... I cut you off. 
 You came to say something. 
 Please, say it, I deserve it. 
 You can't do that again. 
 You just, you can't cross that line. 
 You could've... 
 I know... 
 I know and believe me, it is killing me. and I would understand if you never want to see me again. 
 This can't just be because of a hickey. 
 Well, obviously I do-- 
 I'm here, aren't I? 
 You're scared. 
 It's just my shoe, it's killing me. 
 Look, can we just, maybe start again? 
 Because I was having such a great time with you, up un... 
 So was I. 
 So, um, it would have to be with-without... 
 Without me asking any questions? 
 Yeah, you know, kind of like "don't ask, don't tell." 
 Like that ever works. 
 Yeah, we can just talk about current events and the weather. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How about tonight? 
 I mean, I could come by yours... if you're free and... 
 7:00 p.m. maybe? 
 Yeah, that sounds great. 
 Okay. 
 Catherine? 
 Uh, thank you. 
 For what? 
 For giving me another shot. 
 (knocking) 
 (door opens) 
 JT, thanks for coming. 
 The FBI are all over this case, so we need to crack it before they start seeing beasts, too. 
 This is what you need decoded? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a file that was sent to Vincent at the time of the murder. 
 We're hoping they're connected. 
 Oh, what's Vincent gotten himself into now? 
 Not to be nitpicky, but whoever it is got into him. 
 All right, good news. 
 The security camera in the garage was adjusted, so we don't have to worry about exposure, but the I.P. address is a dead end. 
 Well, do the names Larchman, Gaudet and Thorncliff mean anything to anyone? 
 Sounds like a law firm. 
 Uh, then it says, "Friday at 5:00." 
 So, what... he's got an appointment with an attorney? 
 He does have plenty to sue over. 
 No, they're art galleries. 
 Art galleries? 
 Okay, I'm sorry, I know you want to figure out what's going on with your boyfriend, but just tell me what this has to do with Tucker's murder? 
 Tess, he was killed by a beast. 
 We know Vincent has tracked a beast in the past. 
 So you think he's following this new one? 
 I think someone sent him to track him. 
 Maybe I can find out what Vincent knows on our date. 
 You have a date with him, after...? 
 It's not a real date. 
 I wasn't planning on it happening. but we can use it as part of our investigation. 
 Right, a "don't ask, don't tell" investigation. 
 In the meantime, why don't we investigate our victim? 
 Well, right now I have a date with my sister. 
 And that is real. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 It's you. Uh, Condor. 
 Tucker's dead, who else would it be? 
 His killer, he called me from the crime scene. 
 He was there, waiting for me. 
 You have a description? 
 Uh, barely, he's fast. 
 And British. 
 It is Sebastian. 
 NYPD is investigating Tucker. 
 I just learned they're also looking into art galleries, all of which are owned by Nigel Clifton. 
 What they don't know is that Clifton's son Sebastian was a Muirfield project who escaped when we exterminated Muirfield. 
 So is that why he's on your list? 
 You put two and two together? 
 Because that's what we're doing here, right? 
 You've got a list of names. 
 Tucker's job was to locate them. 
 And then I eliminate them, one by one. 
 Just trying to keep people safe, remember? 
 Is that why I'm on the list too, sir? 
 Who told you that? Sebastian? 
 He's just trying to throw you off. 
 Okay, why should I believe you? 
 Because if I betray you, you could kill me in seconds. 
 Now, Vincent... you've got to trust me. 
 You are not on the list. 
 But Sebastian is and we've got to stop him before he kills again. 
 So, what happens Friday at 5:00? 
 Unclear, sir. 
 Look, you said Sebastian's father owned art galleries, right? 
 I think they were listed on the file that Tucker sent through. 
 I-I guess that's how he trailed them all the way there. 
 Well, wait, why would the NYPD know this? 
 There was no cell phone at the crime scene. 
 Vincent, I'm not the one you need to be worried about. 
 I think we've had a security breach. 
 Not on my end, sir, I would know. 
 Are you sure? 
 
 
 
 ♪ Opened the gate to welcome my fall ♪ 
♪ Right down to the bait... 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I got here early. 
 Clearly. 
 That is a long list of pros. 
 They're just things like weather, I mean, you can't make life decisions based on them. 
 Talk to everyone in California. 
 Yeah, but California doesn't have humidity. Another con. 
 So, it's just... me and humidity? 
 Well, it's better you're a con than a pro. 
 It means I actually like being around you. 
 Um, if this is something that you really want... 
 I know that we've been through a lot, you know, losing Dad, but you're not gonna lose me, too. 
 I think that's what I'm afraid of. 
 Okay, then I will buy five round-trip tickets to Florida right now, if that makes you feel better. 
 No, it's, um, it's not just about the distance. 
 Um... 
 You know how I've been trying to tell you something for a while but you've just been so busy? 
 Um, it's-it's about Dad. 
 When he had his accident. 
 Uh, we both gave blood. 
 Um... yours wasn't a match. 
 What? 
 I mean, he's still your father, obviously, he raised you... 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 (laughs) 
 So, you're telling me that biologically Dad and I aren't... 
 Or maybe they got it wrong. 
 I mean, hospitals make mistakes all the time. 
 Hospitals? 
 So, they told you this? 
 Heather, that was three months ago. 
 Yes, yes, I-I should've told you... 
 You've kept this from me this entire time? 
 It's just, we've been like ships in the night... 
 It doesn't take very long to say, "Dad is not your dad." 
 I'm not defending it, I'm just saying, it's not exactly something you blurt out over voice mail. 
 I was waiting for the perfect moment, okay? 
 And-and you weren't in the right headspace. 
 Okay, so this is my fault? 
 It's not either of our faults, Cat. 
 We just lost our dad. 
 Your dad. 
 I didn't want to pile this on you. 
 And he was your dad. 
 Just like you're still my sister. 
 So if you think about it, this really doesn't affect anything. 
 Well, I am feeling pretty affected right now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Heather, go to Miami. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Did I get the time wrong, or...? 
 No, no, I just... 
 I've had a really intense day, and I-I needed to walk it off. 
 Work? 
 I wish. 
 These are beautiful. 
 You know, we, uh... never really talk about your work. 
 Well, we probably shouldn't start now. 
 If whatever it was crossed over with what you're doing... 
 I mean, that's what we said, right? No questions? 
 Right, just stick to current events and the weather. 
 We could always talk about what you want to do tonight. 
 Are you hungry? 
 (heartbeat racing) 
 Not really. 
 Yeah, but let me ask you, uh, what case are you working on right now? 
 A homicide. 
 I don't think that we should... 
 Who? 
 (heartbeat racing) Vincent, if you're sensing something, I just found out my dad's not my dad, and my sister's known for three months and it's just a lot for me to process. 
 You know what? 
 Let's just take a rain check. 
 Vincent, wait. 
 The door was unlocked. 
 I just came to talk about our relationship. 
 Well, we can just stick to current events and weather. 
 You can't do that again. You just can't cross that line. (phone ringing) (sighs) Hey. Tess : Hey. I actually think your undercover idea is a good one. No. I think he busted me. He knows that I was there investigating him. What happened? Oh, I had this terrible conversation with Heather and I, uh... forgot I was undercover. You should have seen his face when he realized I was lying to him. He thought I was giving him a second chance. Look, I know you were doing this to get back with your boyfriend. Well, you might've, but I didn't. I know you thought you were protecting the public. Well, the good news is, you are. Those art galleries on Vincent's computer? I traced Agent Tucker's DOT card. He parked near every one of them. He must've been tracking the same beast at the galleries. Does that mean the FBI knows? I don't think so, or Tucker would've had a tranq on him. You know, he probably thought he was tracking an art thief or something. Point is, Vincent's probably after him. You need to go back undercover, That's what we do. (line ringing) That's my other line, I'll call you back. Chandler. Vincent : Hey, it's me. Hi. Hi. Look, um... I didn't mean to run out like that before. I was just, um... I was just, uh, so overwhelmed. I know, um... I had a memory. What? Yeah, uh... were you and I ever at a... like, a swimming pool? What are you talking about? Well, were we ever in a, um, you know, like a pool? Like a hotel pool? Yeah. You just had this memory in my hallway? Yeah, I mean, I can't explain it. I just had this memory of us buying bathing suits at some gift shop. Oh, my God, Vincent. I know. It's crazy, right? So, uh, I was thinking we could go back there, you know? Maybe it might trigger more memories. Yeah. Yes, of course. Okay, well, I'm... I'm free in an hour. Wait, you want to go right now? Yeah, why not? And bring your bathing suit, we're going swimming. 'Cause that's what we did before, right? Yeah. Um, I'll see you soon. Yeah, okay. (dialing) (line ringing) JT : Hello? JT, you said you gave Vincent a Cliffs Notes version of our relationship. Did that include a hotel pool? Yeah, why? Was I not supposed to tell him about that? No, he just pretended to remember it. What? Yeah. But why would he do that? Because he realized I was investigating him and he's trying to throw me off his trail by sending me to a hotel pool. Maybe he just wants to see you in a bathing suit. No, JT.

Says here this is  Time Out New York's  event of the week. Clifton commissioned it in honor of his only son, Sebastian. Wait, so this really is about art? I think it's about the son. He was British Armed Forces, KIA'd in Afghanistan. Which is the same thing you'll find if you do a search on Vincent. So you think Sebastian's another one of Muirfield's experiments? And probably the one that killed Agent Tucker. And I will bet anything that Vincent's here looking for him, too. And faked that memory to throw me off his trail. What are we going to do if a beast brawl breaks out? Improvise? No, we're going to stop it before it happens. How? Did you figure out what Sebastian's doing here? No, but there's gotta be a reason that tonight's the night Vincent's been sent after him. So, let me guess: we're backup, and you're going on a "date" with him? He wishes.

♪ Ba dlu dla dlun dloday So your plan is to tranq me in the middle of all these people? If you don't tell me what's going on. We'll just blame it on an allergic reaction. Red wine and shellfish don't mix. Dip. ♪ From the front to the middle to the back to the end ♪ 
♪ Back, back, back ♪ 
♪  I wanna  ♪ Tess : So, what are we supposed to do, just wait and watch? ♪ Back, back, back ♪ 
♪  I wanna  ♪ Hello? Uh, it looks like she's getting somewhere with him. Maybe if you can find out more about that painting, we'll know what Sebastian's planning. I'll stay here and make sure nothing happens. Gotcha, boss. So, what else is happening here tonight, besides art being sold? Is Sebastian here for a good time? To, uh, see his dad, or to put his fist through someone's chest? Why would I tell you anything? Okay, I lied, but... No. You are using me to try and get information on your case, and get... revenge. Revenge? Yeah, a lot of that going around tonight. Who, Sebastian? Is that why he's here? Revenge against whom? ♪ Ba dlu dla dlun dloday I'm talking about you. ♪ Back to the middle to the front to the end. ♪ You think I'm doing all this because you hurt me. Okay. I wore a scarf all day to cover up what you did, telling myself and anyone who would listen that... that this wasn't your fault. That if I could find whoever was controlling you, I could cut those strings, and we could be together again. I lied because I care about you. You lied for a case. And the saddest part about this entire thing is that no one forced you to fake that memory, you did that all on your own. Thanks for the dance. Sebastian : She is spunky. I'll make her disappear, too. Make for a better show. Excuse me. Clifton : That's called  Friday at Five. That was the time of the week I set aside, my son and I would go to the magic store, buy a new trick. So you were close. Okay, I'm done saving Vincent, but it seems that Sebastian isn't just here to say hi to his dad. So we need to focus on keeping these guests safe. Okay, my new BFF Nigel Clifton filled me in. Apparently, Sebastian was into magic. Dad sends him off to the military, thinks he's dead. It'd make for a pretty good magic show if he reappeared during the auction in front of all these people. Dad sent him? Yeah, he's totally guilt-ridden. Vincent said something about revenge. I thought he was referring to me, maybe he was talking about Sebastian. So he's here to kill his dad in front of all these people? Revenge for what? Sending him to war. No, I'm talking about you. 'Cause that is not a hickey. Did Vincent... Tess... Okay, can we not do this now? So you've known about this, too? That was the lie on the polygraph. Okay, I'm sorry... And now is not the time. Right now, we need to figure out how to get Clifton and these people out of here before Sebastian's big show. Excuse me, sir. You need to come with me. We have reason to believe there has been a threat on your life. Well, deal with it. I hired you people to keep the riffraff out. I'm about to get up in front of all these people. It's for charity. Yes. Mr. Clifton, hi. I think I spilled red wine on your Jackson Pollack. I don't have a Pollack. Oh, that, uh, splotchy painting in the elevator? What? My backup are evacuating the guests. You need to hold off Sebastian. Tess : There's a gas leak. We've been asked to evacuate the building. We need everyone to take the stairs. Enjoying the party? I was until you and your girlfriend ruined the show. I don't see anything. Oh. Did I say red wine? I meant white. It's not like a couch. You can't just throw soda water on it and make it go away. Lady, I didn't get where I am from being an idiot. What's going on? There is a threat on your life. Sebastian : I warned you. I crossed you off that list. Yeah, there's no reception. I'm sure this is nothing to do with the threat. What kind of threat are we speaking about exactly? (bangs) What was that? Hi, Sebastian. I thought I had daddy issues. (gun clicking) (panting) (grunting) (laughs) (screaming) (gasps) Vincent! (panting) Heathe. (sighs) I'm not gonna take the job. Oh, my God. No, listen. I... I can't leave knowing that I've damaged our relationship. I mean, you're the only family I have, and I will do anything... I'm a hypocrite. I made you feel bad for not telling me, for not being honest, but you know what I spent my morning doing? Learning how to cheat a polygraph. You can do that? Yes. The point is, you had your reasons for doing what you did, and I have been impossible to pin down. No, I-I still should have come clean. Isn't that what Dad should have done? Maybe he didn't know. You're right. Maybe Mom's the liar or both. Who knows? But you're right. This doesn't change us. You're still my sister. (sighs) That's the thing, though, I just... I don't know. I haven't really felt like it. I've been avoiding you because carrying this around and-and being dishonest with you has felt horrible. Lying to someone, it changes everything. I may have had my reasons, but it wasn't worth it. Are you sure that you're not my big sister? (chuckles) And our parents didn't fudge our birth order, too. (chuckles) Take this job. But you weren't just on the con list because I hadn't told you yet. You were... You were on it because I miss you already. I've missed you for three months. The truth is I've missed you for longer, but... I can't be the con that keeps you from taking this job. (sighs) And your hair can handle the humidity. Well, so can yours, okay? You're totally buying those round-trip tickets. (chuckles) Come here. How's your BFF Clifton? Oh, drowsy and completely unaware of beasts or any dead sons coming back to haunt him. How are the feds? Blamed Agent Tucker's murder on Sebastian. Off-the-grid vet, mistakenly declared K.I.A., struggling with severe PTSD. I suggested we not release the information wide, let Clifton Senior think his son died a war hero. Agent Reynolds was surprisingly supportive. Oh, the polygraph, thanks. I wasn't sure where that was supposed to go. Hey, give me your hands. Why? (laughs) What are you doing? I just want to ask you a few questions. Tess, is this about the hickey? Because... I'm not hiding anything else. Oh, I think you are. You protected her secret for a reason. Because she didn't want to hear it from you. Or because you have a crush on her. Good night, Tess. You realize your refusing to take a polygraph makes you look highly suspicious. And you realize you sound like you're in middle school and you're acting out because she didn't tell you. ♪ You come around and make the seasons change ♪ 
♪ You come around and leave the way... ♪ Did JT tell you about the fire escape, too? I remembered it. Vincent, please don't do this right now. And I also remember grabbing you out of the way of an oncoming train. And another time we were in the woods and you had braids and it was so cold I could see your breath. Look, I know they're just flashes, but... I do, Catherine, I remember you. And I'm not borrowing from JT this time, okay? You can ask him. Even if it is the truth... It is. I'm sorry for pretending. But I couldn't trust you because I didn't remember you. But now... There are so many more lies in our relationship than just one pretend memory. There are so many things I can't ask you. What do you do? Who do you work for? Exactly. And it isn't just you who's lying. I... (chuckles) I put antiperspirant on my forehead so that I could... find out what's going on in your life. You were just trying to help me out, okay? And I didn't realize that back then, but I can see it now. Catherine, after everything that you have been through, I am not gonna push you away anymore. Maybe it's because my parents lied so much, I just... I've reached my lifetime capacity for it. This isn't gonna be forever, okay? It's too late. Heather's right. You lie once and-and... and it changes everything. That relationship that you're remembering? We never lied to each other. I just can't... I can't handle it. I can't live with any more lies. It's too hard.
