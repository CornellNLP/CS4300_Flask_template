 Catherine : From the moment we met... 
 Vincent :  We knew our lives would never be the same. 
 He saved my life. 
 And she saved mine. 
 Catherine :  We're destined. 
 Vincent :  But we know it won't be easy. 
 Catherine :  Even though we have every reason to stay apart... 
 We'll risk it all to be together. I am so in love with you. I am starting to think that you're hiding something. I'm starting to think the same thing. I got in contact with some people who will destroy this thing once and for all. Muirfield? It was an experiment-- Vincent, he was a soldier. No one can know. Remember that woman I told you about? Catherine. You have a thing for her. (basketball announcer speaking indistinctly over television) There you go, sir. That was fast. You said it was urgent. I came. It is. And is this urgent information the reason you're hitting the sauce at noon? Sauce? This is Lochlynn 18. The reason I'm drinking it is none of your business. I found your creature. Your team are gonna have to sweep the tunnels. I saw that thing enter a sewer pipe near Varick and Spring. I think that's where he's been hiding out. And you picked up the trail where? Does it matter? Forgive me if I'm being skeptical, but before I put ten agents at risk, I'd like to know that your intel is solid. Unless you want the trail to go cold, I suggest you drop the questions and deploy your team. The intel is solid. Sit down, have a drink. Yeah, we'll have a celebratory one, after. Look, if anything goes wrong, I want you to be protected. Creature mace? It's a panic button. Muirfield takes care of its own. They certainly do look out for their own. (basketball announcer speaking indistinctly over television) (grunts) Bartender : What the hell? Woman : Buddy, what's your problem? Somebody call the cops. Take it easy, step back.

♪ The bustling fervor of New York... ♪ Don't let me stop you. (laughs) I wish you could have stayed last night. I'm sorry that Heather was here. That's fine-- I had to check in with JT anyway. What's he doing now that you guys are, um...? Homeless? I was going to say "in flux." Yeah, well, he's sleeping in his office, showering at the gym, and doing his laundry in one of the dorms. Aw, you miss him. No, I miss having my own place to wash my own clothes and... take a shower for that matter. Then it's a good thing that you have a girlfriend. ♪ Burning within my heart and mind ♪

♪ And I'd never felt so all alone ♪ 
♪ It's bigger than love... And in three, two, one... (knock on door) Uh, who is it? Tess : Your damn partner. I thought we could have some girl time. But you're having boy time. Hey. Uh, (clears throat) Vincent. What? Your fly. Oh, I'm sorry. (zips, chuckles) That's what you're apologizing for? That and, um... and about the, the tunnels the other day. I just, um... I-I don't want things to be, you know, weird between us. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, the whole manimal thing is a lot to wrap my head around. But you did save my neck. And hers. It's kind of hard to hate on that. Thank you. Um, and I just, I-I want you to know that I would never hurt her. Well, you better not, 'cause I don't care what kind of super soldier you are. If you did, I... Okay, and we are going to the roof. Sorry to leave you hanging. Uh, it's, it's okay. I can, I can actually do my own laundry. Right. 'Cause that's what you two were about to do. Sorry to sock-block, big guy. Okay. (laughs) Tess :  I'm sorry. I'm just really trying to get used to all this. You know, first he was a serial killer we were chasing. And now he's Hulk with a heart of gold. You should see him with his shirt off. (laughs) I did not just say that. But since you did... No, no, s*x questions-- those are off limits. Aw, God, you're such a prude. Trust me, I'm not. (both laugh) Okay, before I dig myself in any deeper, um, there are some things we need to talk about. Serious things. About protecting Vincent. Pretty much everything I do is to make sure Muirfield or the cops don't find him. Look, I told you-- you don't have to worry about me. I'm keeping his secret. Tess, this isn't just any secret. If Muirfield finds him or anyone who's close to him... They're dead. Okay, if you're... if you're all in with us on this, your entire life-- it's gonna change just like mine did, so... you have to decide for yourself if you want this. (cell phone rings) Chandler. Uh, yeah, okay, I'll be right there. What's wrong? Central Booking. Evan's in the drunk tank. Man : Open up number three, please. (keys jingling) (door unlocking) You punched a guy at a bar? I had to. To see you. They were watching me. Who was watching you? I think we both know who they are. The people who want to catch your, um, new boyfriend. Uh, boyfriend? I don't know... What I don't understand is how you could choose him. A monster. 'Cause that's what he is. You know that, right? I don't know what you are talking about... Just stop. Okay, stop. We have been playing this game for a year now. It's done. I saw you last night with him. On your fire escape. Kissing him. Kissing that... that thing. Evan... What? You gonna tell me that I'm wrong? Go ahead. Tell me that it's PTSD from almost getting mauled in the tunnels. Or, or that I misinterpreted his DNA on your scarf. Come on. I want to hear you spin what I saw with my own two eyes. You have no idea who or what he is. What he is, is a danger to you and everyone around you. According to who? Your friends at Muirfield? The only reason I joined them was to help them erase their mistake before it succumbs to its animal nature entirely and kills you, too. He would never do that. Why? Because he loves you? Look at me, the fool. Trying to protect you. Even as we speak. Do you really think that your feelings for this-this monster are real? Evan, I know that you care about me, but... Wait. What do you mean, protecting me even as we speak? Evan. Evan, what did you do? Why did you bring me here? Why now? So I'd know you'd be safe when they came for him. No. Hey! Cat! Cat, stay away from him. Cat! JT : Thanks for helping me move these. Did you do laundry at Cat's? Maybe, why? 'Cause your spring rain scent is drowning out the raw sewage and rat droppings. Yeah, well, imagine it with my sense of smell. Oh, crap, um, I'm late. It's okay, give me the stuff. Thanks for the assist, big guy. Catch you topside? (radio static crackling) Any maintenance personnel supposed to be down here? Negative-- that's our target. Let's move. Go, go, go, go. Move, move left. Turn right... Clear. Where the hell did he go? That's not possible. He can't do that. We don't know what he can do. ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x18 ♪ Heart of Darkness 
Original Air Date on April 18, 2013 (siren wailing) (dog barking, woman calling dog) I'm happy to see you. You have no idea. Sorry I took so long. I just wanted to make sure that they weren't following us. Catherine, these Muirfield guys-- they knew exactly where I was. I'm talking precise coordinates. It just, it doesn't make sense. It does. Um, Evan tipped them off. How do you know? He told me. He saw us together at my apartment two nights ago, and then he followed you to the tunnels from there. Maybe if I had just been honest with him sooner. Catherine, come on, it's not your fault. It  is  my fault. I let him take things too far, especially his feelings for me. You should have heard him. What'd he say? That we could never be together, that our love would never work out. He was upset. He sent a death squad after me. Which is why I need to talk to him and convince him that you're not the monster that he thinks you are. If he can bring Muirfield to your door, he can lure them away. No, you're in enough danger as it is. I think it's about time I talk to him. Okay, I don't see that ending well. Listen, Catherine, they're gonna ask him how he picked up on my trail, okay? And he may deflect a few times, but eventually they will stop asking nicely and he will give you up. Okay, you know it's true, and I can't let that happen. You're gonna have to, 'cause you can't walk into my precinct for a little mano a mano. I can take care of this, okay? (siren wailing) What are you doing? And where's Evan? That is a good question. He hasn't shown up for work today. So you're tearing apart his morgue? I don't see a reason to stop. Unless of course he said something to you in the tank about the vigilante. I have connections, too. Evan is my friend, that's why I went to see him. And last I heard, the vigilante was dead. And I have some questions about the circumstances surrounding his death. I don't understand why you're singling Evan out. Believe me, I'm not. Catherine : My desk drawer was cracked open this morning. Was that you? You going through my things? Yeah. You're light on number two pencils, and I think those oatmeal packets expired about a decade ago. I'm sure you have a warrant for all of this. I wrote it myself this morning. On the grounds of "obstruction of justice." Should I be getting my union rep involved? We have a mole in the department. That chemical warehouse blowing up just as we arrived? It's all a bit too much of a coincidence. And I'm a suspect. Right now our M.I.A. medical examiner is the chief suspect, but no one's been ruled out. Vincent : Don't even think about calling her. What are you doing here? Trying to stop you from getting Catherine killed like you tried with me. They would have bugged your phone by now. You push send, and they will track her down and they will kill her. Now what? You gonna rip out my throat? Oh, it's tempting. But here's your other option: you're gonna pick up my trail somewhere else, somewhere that Muirfield will follow. Somewhere you want to live, where you can get lost and never come back. That's it? I just abandon Catherine into your so-called hands? You have no idea of the people you just signed up with, do you? They're dangerous. And you're not? The vigilante who's killed countless New Yorkers? Cat's better off with a menace like you? She seems to think so. She's just fascinated by you. That's the only reason why she's with you. Or maybe she's in love with me. You really think dragging her into your world, forcing her into some twisted relationship with a monster is protecting her? How long do you think this fairy tale will last? You're on the wrong side. You need to stop this hunt now. Hunt? You're to blame. You knew that Muirfield were after you and yet you put Catherine right in the middle of it all. You put her life on the line just so you could selfishly be with her. Are you really so naive to think that this black ops agency is just gonna let Catherine go? I know them. I know they'll ask you if you found me. How long do you think you'll last before you give up her name? I would never. They have killed men ten times stronger than you. When push comes to shove, you will break. And then who's the threat to her? There won't be a threat once you're gone. Man : Oh, oh, sorry. It's okay. I'm so sorry about that. It's okay, sir. 
 
 Hey! Hey! Hey, last car, stop running! I will not let you hurt her. What do you think you can really offer her? Do you think Cat wants to hide out like hunted prey for the rest of her life? She deserves to be with a man. (steam hisses) (gunfire) (grunts) (dialing) (line ringing) This is Evan Marks. Please leave a message. Hey, what's with the creep at six o'clock? That's Vincent's roommate. Okay. Uh... (door opens) I haven't decided anything. I'm just listening. So, is she cool? Cooler than you in a ladies' locker room. I'm JT Forbes. Yeah. I'm sorry about the whole tranq thing. What tranq thing? Can we skip this part? Happily. So, Vincent showed up at campus warning me not to go back the tunnels. I know about the raid. Yeah, well, then he proceeded to storm out, saying he was gonna deal with it once and for all. Dude was pissed. Do we have any idea where he was going? No, but I'd say at the top of the list of people pissing him off... Evan. He's involved in this, too? He thinks I'm in danger because of Vincent and that giving me up will somehow protect me. I got worried so I tried tracing a tracking app I put on his burner in case of emergencies. And? And I narrowed his location to a four-block radius on the edge of the city. And then, surprise, the signal was jammed. It's them, isn't it? That's my guess. Okay, can you guys stop talking in code? Muirfield got closer than they've ever been to him last night. And they usually don't knock just once. They've got him. We gotta go. Let me see that. I'm not leaving you with the geek squad as backup. I've been here an hour. Any chance I can go home now? Kyle wants you to wait here. He has a few more questions for you. He's an intense guy. I barely know what this is. I mean, personnel everywhere, labs on lockdown. Seems like a lot of activity to catch one target. I mean, unless this is more than just the apprehension of the creature. (chuckling): I get it. You don't even know yourself. I mean, a man at your level, you probably have to ask permission to go to the bathroom. What am I even talking to you for? I mean, you're a Muirfield man, right? Believe in the mission and all that. You don't know what I believe. What  do  you believe in? You should take a seat. (scoffs) I'm going to the restroom. Don't go anywhere. (beeps) (beeps) ♪ Oh, my... JT :  Someone want to tell me why an empty building has more volts coursing  through it than the Pentagon? Catherine : Looks like Muirfield is up and running. Half the power's probably feeding that fence. JT : Nice. I got to get rid of my hatchback. So, what now? JT : There's a transformer close by supplying power to all the buildings in the area. We take that out and we get past the electrified fence. I'll help TJ. It's JT. Catherine : It's not just the fence we have to worry about. Unless they're having an open house, how am I supposed to get in the door? All right, that's the point of a stakeout. See that? (speaks indistinctly) Their security doors are voice recognition. Okay, how's that gonna help? I doubt we're on the list. JT : Maybe we aren't, but what about Evan? He wouldn't have had clearance yet, but his ex from Muirfield would. You were monitoring Evan's phone calls, right? Do you have any old voice mails from Claire? (fence buzzing) All right, do you see any transformers? 'Cause I'm just looking at a sea of "not transformers". Keep looking. Should be right here. Wait a minute. Why do you have a constipated look on your face? Maybe we're standing on it. Uh, there's got to be a ventilation system. (quietly): Come on, come on. This it? Perfect. Hey, look, don't take this as a personal criticism, but you can't fit down a seven inch vent pipe. I can reach it from here. Wow, I carry a gun, you carry IEDs? Homemade. Let's go. Ten, nine, eight, seven, come on, six. Come on. (fence stops buzzing) (panting) (grunting) Hey, Evan, it's Claire. My flight's been delayed, but... (door beeps) (alarm blaring) (beeps) (gasps) (alarm stops) You are something else. The way you escaped in those tunnels. Phew, I've never seen anything like that. But I knew we'd find you eventually. That makes two of us. Which one are you? Agent J or K? Well, I can tell you one thing, I'm not Agent Cole. I'm assuming you're the reason he disappeared? Hmm. Older Muirfield agent? Kind of thought he was suave? Yeah. You are a fearless man. (chuckles) Unfortunately, this is the end of the line for you. You gonna chop me up, dissect me, feed me to a giant juicer? Isn't that what you deserve? Except, nowadays, we pump you full of adrenaline, keeping you wide awake while the surgeon unzips you like a duffel bag. (light growling) You can't stop progress. Man (over radio) : Sir, we have a security breach. Confirm. We have a security breach. Muirfield haven't stopped their experiments. They're trying to make a new generation of crosspecies creature. And you're just putting this together now? They want to cut you open and see what make you tick. They know what makes me tick, they made me. I was part of a highly classified, secret military experiment to create a unit of super soldiers. These people are lethal. Okay? That's why JT tried to stop you from joining them. You know JT Forbes? Yeah, we grew up together. Picture becoming clearer for you now? Grew up? I-- you mean, they didn't... What, grow me in a petri dish? Is that what you think? I-I thought maybe they intervened at the embryonic stage. My name is Vincent Ryan Keller, Specialist, United States Army. Okay, these people destroyed my life. They injected me... With cross-species DNA. Yeah. The experiments went wrong. They couldn't control us, they couldn't control their side effects. And now they want to improve upon their mistakes. They lied to me. They said that they just wanted to tie up loose ends. Yeah, well, now you and Catherine are those loose ends. So, if anything happens to her, it is on your hands. I... I don't know if I can save her. Vincent : Evan! (grunts) Who'd you let in here? Go to hell. (grunting) How you gonna get there before me? (grunts) (alarm blaring) (panting) (gasps) Kyle : Who breached security? (grunting) For the last time, who breached security? Who did you let in here?! Even if I did know who the infiltrator was, I'd never tell you. You might as well kill me. I was planning on it. ♪ (grunts) You shoot, they'll know you're here. (both panting) (Vincent growls) (groans) (alarm blaring) Catherine. I can't leave Evan. Catherine, I got to get you out of here. Catherine : Evan. Cat, you shouldn't have come. Vincent, oh my, God. Give me your jacket. Here. (groans) (winces) I'm not sure. We're gonna get you out of here. Get you help, you'll heal, and you'll get back to your life. And I'm gonna somehow convince Gabe that you're not a mole. (chuckles) He thinks I'm the mole? You or me. He's on a hunt to track down whoever's leaking the task force plans. If he thinks it's you... It doesn't matter. We're going to get through this. Catherine, we got to go. Cat, listen to him. Run. No one's running without you. Come on. Okay, there's an exit in the underground electrical tunnels. I'm gonna make sure the coast is clear. Okay, come on, slowly. (groans) Wait. Are you gonna tell her about her parents? I found it in her mother's file. You know, don't you? Yes. Look, we can't tell her, okay? Just give me your weight, come on. (Evan panting) (groans) That door wasn't in the plans. (groaning) Hey, come on, it's okay. Can you open it? I don't know. I'll give it a go, okay? (grunting) An SOS message isn't really gonna help us right now. (grunting continues) (growling) (panting) (roaring) Holy... We need more time. Pick up the pace. Catherine, we're not all getting out of here. No. No, we are all going to get out. I let my feelings for you blind me of the truth about Muirfield. I was just trying to protect you. I thought that Vincent was a threat. I called Muirfield. No, you didn't know. You couldn't... you couldn't know. Muirfield need to be stopped. I see that now. If I can help you and him get out of here alive... (roaring continues) ...I'll be really protecting you. It'd be the best thing that I've ever done in my life. The point of it, really. (banging and roaring continue) (roaring) (groaning) Evan, no! (gasps) Get 'em! (snarls) (panting) (crying) ♪ (knocking) If you're wondering what happened to Evan, I don't know. I know what happened to Evan. You do? Yeah. He skipped town. He was the mole. You're off the hook. Well, that is good to know. Um, why are you so sure? Yeah, for a minute there, I thought you might have had some kind of involvement. What changed your mind? I received a confession from Evan. Received? How? By e-mail. Quite the statement, too. He said that he'd been covering for the vigilante this whole time, that he was a symbol of heroism in an age where justice had become encumbered by red tape. He took the blame. (chuckles) He is to blame. Our I.T. department verified the e-mail was sent from his cell phone last night. It appears to be the real deal. I guess he felt the walls closing in on him. How do you always find me? I never stop looking. Maybe you should. I almost got you killed, and Evan died, and he took the blame for me at the precinct. Catherine, come on. You were willing to sacrifice your own life to try and help him, even after he betrayed you. Hey. I am in awe of you. Do you know how strong you are? Strong? I am selfish. He's dead because of me. No, Evan made his own decisions. He did what he did because he cared about you. I'm putting you at risk, too. You're taking way too much responsibility. Am I? If I hadn't shown up at the warehouse after we first met, you would have left town. Muirfield never would have found you. How does that make you selfish? I should have pushed you away, but I pulled you closer. I couldn't help it. And you think I could? In all those years that I was watching over you, making sure you were safe, all I ever wanted was to meet you, to get to know you. So when you walked up those stairs that day in the warehouse, and you had figured out who I was, and I was begging you not to tell anyone... I remember. That was the best day of my life. Vincent... No, it was, and I know it was wrong. I know I should have run right then and there, and that would've been the safest thing for you, but even though Muirfield was out there, I just... I couldn't help myself either. That's not true. You pushed me away. Do you really think I tried as hard as I could have? ♪ You've no need for them now... ♪ We put each other in danger. ♪ You lay your arrows down... That's what Evan showed me tonight. And as long as we love each other this much and will do... anything to protect each other... Hey. We are always gonna be vulnerable. But I don't know what to do now because... I can't live without you. ♪ Lay your arrows down ♪ 
♪ Yeah, you've no need for them now... ♪ We wouldn't have to be vulnerable if Muirfield was out of the way.
