  And I was dating a guy named Leonard because, 20/20 hindsight, - I loved his sister Ashley. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  And I would write monologues about her - and perform them in class.

  You are on the tip of my tongue When I think it's been too long So, is there a reason you're dressed like an Easter Peep? 
  Shane, I chose this color so it would pop. 
  Like, this L. A. 
  Times reporter is following me around all day for this profile, and I would like the article to say, like, "Alice Pieszecki Is Killing It". 
  - You know, maybe in capitals. 
  - [BETTE] 
  Hi. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  So sorry I'm late. 
  Happy birthday. 
  [SHANE] 
  Thank you. 
  It's not a big deal. 
  Everyone, relax. 
  Well, it can be. 
  I mean, you can experience true metamorphosis at 40 if you let yourself. 
  [ALICE] 
  Don't listen to that bullshit. 
  sh1t gets weird. 
  Things on your body start dropping and changing. 
  My ass, it's not obvious, but it has moved, I can tell. 
  None of us has anything to complain about. 
  Look, I I never knew I'd get this far, so I'm just happy. 
  Good, you should be. 
  Yeah. 
  Um, so we want to do something to celebrate your birthday - No. 
  - Just I said no party. 
  - Not a party. 
  - No. 
  We just have to do something. 
  I mean, it's your 40th birthday. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Oh, God, you guys. 
  [ALICE]

  Yeah. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  I know, 'cause I was laughing inside, too. 
  Oh Yeah, it has been a long time. 
  No, how long has it been? 
  - A year? 
  - It hasn't been that long. 
  You know, I know people. 
  I'm sure you do. 
  Is there something you wanted to show us?

  Just a little bit, little bit. 
  I got to say I feel like I'm going into a - No, no, no, no, no. 
  - We're going downhill all of a sudden. 
  - We're almost there, almost there, almost there. 
  - We're going down a hill. 
  - Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
  - Okay. 
  - Turn this way. 
  - Okay.

  It's the best, it's - Right? 
  - It's the best. 
  - Amazing. 
  - Dana would love it. 
  - When did you think of that? 
  - Are you kidding me? 
  I just, I mean, it's an obvious choice. 
  It's so good! 
  I love you guys. 
  Let's take a picture. 
  - I love you. 
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  Take a picture, okay.

  Um, you totally over-ordered. 
  I just thought, you know, we'd, we'd need I mean, where are we even gonna hide all of this? 
  [SHANE] 
  Hey. 
  - Happy birthday. 
  - Hey, boss. 
  Thanks. 
  Uh, do you have some checks for me to sign? 
  - Yes - I'll show you. 
  Great. 
  Tess, thank you so much for this. 
  Sure. 
  So, I know you don't like to make a big deal out of your birthday or anything. 
  I really want to do something for you. 
  [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  - [STAGE BELL RINGING] 
  - [MAN] 
  All right, last looks! 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  I had sent you a new copy of this campaign ad. 
  Did you not get my e-mail? 
  No. 
  Excuse me. 
  I don't think so. 
  Yeah. 
  What's wrong? 
  Uh [CHUCKLES] 
  I s-seem to have misplaced my campaign phone. 
  Okay, uh, when did you have it last? 
  I'll figure it out. 
  - Thank you. 
  - You know, um, Sophie and I accidentally took each other's laptops to work once. 
  Do you think that something like that might have happened to you? 
  I'll take care of it. 
  Do you think it's possible that Felicity has your phone? 
  Okay. 
  I'll sort it out. 
  You don't need to do that. 
  Would you prefer I send a volunteer? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Clap your hands if it feels good [COREY] 
  Great. 
  That's so great. 
  Chin down. 
  Awesome. 
  - Relax. 
  - Perfect. 
  Perfect, Alice. 
  Perfect. 
  Let's see that "Alice" thing. 
  Okay. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I don't want to take my picture in this. 
  Okay, honey, I hear you. 
  Do you love me, too? 
  Yeah, I love you Do you love me, too You're doing so great. 
  Hey, Nat. 
  I'm pretty sure Eli's on the loose. 
  sh1t. 
  Eli! 
  - Hey, pook. 
  I heard you won. 
  - Mommy! 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Give me five. 
  Yeah. 
  [MOUTHS] 
  - I'll be right back. 
  - Come on. 
  Hey. 
  - Hi. 
  Yeah. 
  - Thank you so much. 
  I thought wardrobe had options, but they didn't. 
  - No, of course, of course. 
  - Thank you, I really appreciate it. 
  It's my pleasure. 
  You look great. 
  - Yeah. 
  I do? 
  Yeah. 
  It's - Yeah. 
  I love this color. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  I'm Corey Campbell. 
  L. A. Times. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  While I have you, can I ask you a couple questions? 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  - I don't mind. 
  Yeah. 
  How has Alice changed from the first time you two got together till now? 
  - Oh, she's not my girlfriend. 
  - Oh, no, no, no, no. 
  - We're not, we're not together. 
  - No, no, no, no. 
  - But she is the kids' other mom. 
  - Yeah. 
  We're not Mm-hmm. 
  The woman who ran down the hall was my - Nat. 
  Nat is her - Yeah. 
  Nat is my person. 
  - And my ex-person. 
  - Right, her Yeah, right. 
  Oh, I'm sorry. 
  I assumed she was the nanny. 
  I'll-I'll let you get back to your thing. 
  - Nanny? 
  - [NAT] 
  Found him. 
  He was in the kitchen, ate all the seaweed, but he's very sorry, right, Eli? 
  - At least he didn't get the junk food. 
  - Hi. 
  - Were you in the liquor cabinet? 
  - No. 
  Were you drinking? 
  Are you a drunk? 
  [NAT] 
  Thank you for bringing Okay, I'm gonna get them changed. 
  That's really helpful. 
  Thank you. 
  - Okay, great, of course. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Bye. 
  - You look so cute today. 
  - Aw, you look so pretty. 
  - I do? 
  - Yeah, you look great. 
  - Oh. 
  - Yeah, this is Yup. 
  - Oh. 
  - This is her, this is Nat. 
  - Hi. 
  - So nice to meet you. 
  - You, too. 
  - Corey Campbell of the L. A. Times. 
  - Great. 
  So, tell me, how do you and Alice maintain a healthy work-life balance? 
  - Oh, it's - God, I don't - I'm not sure we do. 
  - It - Oh. 
  - You know, it's really hard, but we try our best. 
  But it's a joyful hard. 
  Yeah. 
  DRAMATIC MUSIC Hmm. 
  It was an honest mistake. 
  Which part? 
  It's not what you think. 
  It doesn't really matter what I think. 
  - I care about her. 
  - Do you? 
  - Yes. 
  - Because this could bring her down. 
  Do you understand that? 
  This has f*cked up my life, too. 
  I still work at the Department of Cultural Affairs. 
  Everywhere I go, people whisper. 
  They think I got here because I f*cked my boss. 
  And my marriage, - my marriage is - None of that matters. 
  Oh, really? 
  And what do you know about it? 
  How many marriages have you failed at? 
  I know that she's out there every day fighting hard for all the right things, but one wrong thing will ruin her. 
  And to the public, you are the wrong thing. 
  - This could end her. 
  - But I love her. 
  I wish the world were different, but it's not. 
  This stays between us. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [SOPHIE] 
  All right, this might sound a little risky. 
  - Yeah, what? 
  - But you've got to ask him about the diversity of his campaign staff. 
  He doesn't have any. 
  Can I do that? 
  Of course. 
  I mean, who else is gonna ask him, Jimmy f*cking Fallon? 
  Knock, knock. 
  Okay, well, you didn't, but, yeah, okay. 
  Take a look at these questions for Milner. 
  Okay, but we already have a working script. 
  What is this? 
  Yeah, I'm not asking him any of these bullshit questions. 
  I thought you wanted to be a pop icon. 
  Talking about high school superlatives is not at all what "pop icon" means. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Why are you smiling? 
  The reporter is right outside. 
  Oh, o-okay. 
  - I see what we're doing here. 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  M-Milner wants to be seen as a real guy. 
  He wants what you did with Bette Porter. 
  Okay, Drew, I would love that because Bette and I talked about her scandal and about feminism and sexism and what it's like to be queer. 
  I wonder which one of those he really identifies with. 
  Oh, you know what? 
  I bet it's feminism. 
  - A "good guy" like him. 
  - Uh. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  I bet he's, like, balls deep in feminism. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Yeah. 
  - Here you go. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Thank you. 
  I'll take a decaf skim latte. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Yeah, of course, right away. 
  She's not gonna get that for me, is she? 
  I wouldn't count on it. 
  Yeah, look, we all want the same thing here. 
  Do we, Drew? 
  Yes. 
  We all want our show to be a success. 
  My show. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  And I know you want to do your feminism. 
  Oh, hell. 
  We're still smiling. 
  - Oh. 
  - But you won't be able to do anything if your show is canceled. 
  - Ah. 
  - Look, I've been down this road before. 
  I've learned this lesson the hard way. 
  The only way to deviate is through incremental change. 
  Fine. 
  I'll ask him about his f*cking horse. 
  It's a pony, but deal. 
  [ALICE] 
  Yeah, we don't do that there. 
  - Get it away. 
  We don't do that. 
  - All right. 
  Okay. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  [GROANS] 
  Incremental change. 
  I know. 
  It's your name. 
  Your show. 
  Thank you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm sorry you had to do that for me. 
  You jeopardized the campaign. 
  I'm painfully aware of that fact. 
  And I'm pretty sure you've course-corrected worse when you were working for your father. 
  I was numb when I worked for him. 
  Ever since I met you, I can feel things. 
  And what I had to do today, it didn't make me feel good. 
  I have given up too much to be here. 
  My career, my relationship with my father. 
  And the energy that I've spent on you instead of my fiancÃ©e it's unforgivable, really. 
  And I'm fine making those sacrifices for someone that I believe in, but I just don't understand how you can throw everything away - for some woman. 
  - She's not just some woman. 
  Is this your M. O. ? 
  You do something great and then you f*ck up?! 
  - Keep your voice down. 
  - Do you have any idea how many people are working their asses off just to get you elected? 
  - I am acutely aware. 
  - Then why are you running? 
  What's the f*cking point?! 
  My sister died of a heroin overdose. 
  That is why I'm running. 
  I am running for her. 
  I am running to change the broken system that failed her. 
  SLOW, SOMBER MUSIC [SIGHS] 
  Felicity was there for me when my sister died. 
  My world shattered, and she helped me pick up all the pieces. 
  You don't just turn your back on someone like that. 
  You can be with her. 
  Or you can stay in this race and fight for what you believe in. 
  But you can't have it both ways. 
  - [CHEERING] 
  - [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] 
  Thank you. 
  And we're back with candidate Jeff Milner talking about high school superlatives. 
  So, best hair, huh? 
  - Well, what can I say? 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  I mean, what can you say? 
  Anyway, high school was a hoot. 
  I always loved school, even as a little kid. 
  And I understand we have something in common. 
  Well, if it's about loving school, I'm afraid you're mistaken. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  - [MILNER] 
  No, no. 
  - We both went to camp. 
  - Ah. 
  Yeah. 
  Well, no. 
  I actually worked at a camp as a kid. 
  You know, stapled sh1t together for the campers, made six bucks an hour. 
  - It was a dream. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  - Well, something for everyone. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  I love being outside, getting dirty, learning about science. 
  Is that where you fell in love with horses? 
  It is indeed. 
  You know, I had a pet pony at camp. 
  Her name was Tubman because I always had an affinity for Harriet Tubman. 
  Always admired her her bravery. 
  - [AUDIENCE MURMURING] 
  - SLOW, SOLEMN MUSIC Would you say Harriet Tubman was a feminist? 
  Oh. 
  Well, I, uh Well, you know [CLEARS THROAT] 
  I don't know about that, but I Uh, she was definitely a hero. 
  - What is she doing? 
  - Oh, I-I - Would you say you're a feminist? 
  - [AUDIENCE CLAMORING] 
  Well, I, uh [WOMAN] 
  We can't hear you, Jeff. 
  Uh, I think all people - deserve to be treated fairly. 
  - I'm calling his people - to get a jump on this. 
  - Yeah, good idea, Drew. 
  [ALICE] 
  Ooh, I got to tell you, that's an infuriating answer, Jeff. 
  Well, you know, your friend Bette Porter identifies as a feminist, and I don't think her actions have been particularly honorable. 
  She made a mistake. 
  She apologized for it, she's moved on. 
  It's all in the past. 
  - Why should we believe her? 
  - Because she's legit. 
  - [WHOOPING] 
  - And if she says "That relationship is over", I f*cking trust her. 
  - Can we trust you? 
  - [AUDIENCE MURMURING] 
  [MILNER] 
  I think my record speaks for itself. 
  Hmm. 
  Let's get back to the ponies. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  This is incredible. 
  She doesn't hold back, does she? 
  Nope. 
  She's always Alice. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  - [DOG BARKS] 
  - [CRICKETS CHIRPING] 
  [HUMMING UPBEAT TUNE] 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - Uh Nope, no, no, no. 
  Nobody invited you. 
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
  Okay. 
  Oh. 
  - Excuse you. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  I know you're mad at me, but I'm trying to love you right now. 
  I'm not mad at you. 
  I feel bad for you. 
  You're missing it. 
  - What am I missing? 
  - Me. 
  - I want to hang out with you. 
  - You do? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Still? 
  Always. 
  I always want to hang out with you. 
  I think about you all the time. 
  Well, do you think about me? 
  When you go to work, you go on, you know, your little runs? 
  Yes. 
  Of course. 
  It doesn't feel like it. 
  - It doesn't? 
  - No. 
  It feels like you're in your own little world, like [SIGHS] 
  Like I can't find you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Why can't you talk to me? 
  What are you so afraid of? 
  - I'm not - What-what ? 
  What have I done that makes you so afraid of me? 
  Uh, sometimes I-I think about the night we met. 
  Yeah. 
  At Akbar. 
  You had a girlfriend. 
  Yeah. 
  That scares me. 
  It does? 
  Yeah. 
  You were so willing to leave her. 
  And I-I guess part of me wonders if if-if you'll leave me, too. 
  She wasn't you. 
  Hold up. 
  - What the hell are you doing?! 
  - Holy sh1t! 
  Motherfucking cold! 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] 
  Oh, you're so cute! 
  - Don't even play. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Cute. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, my God. 
  You have a cute butt. 
  Okay, okay. 
  [MUTTERS] 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - [SIGHS] 
  Okay. 
  [SIGHS] 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - What is this? 
  This was my great-grandma's.

  Don't tell Angie. 
  I would never. 
  Did you ever think you would be spending your 40th birthday with a middle-aged lesbian and no chance of s*x? 
  [SIGHS] 
  - I wish you had told me you were a lesbian. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - You're so secretive. 
  - I don't think that's so much of a secret, actually. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  A toast. 
  To you - [SIGHS] 
  - and your birthday - and your beautiful bar. 
  - That I already f*cked up. 
  What happened? 
  [EXHALES] 
  I might have slept with Lena. 
  And she's still with Tess. 
  Ah, see? 
  I told you I f*cked it up. 
  No. 
  No. 
  It's just human. 
  I mean, I think what happens is that we all get scared, and then we do things, you know, as people, that we shouldn't do. 
  Because we don't want to move on. 
  Maybe we do, and we just don't know how, and so we end up doing really fucked-up sh1t. 
  I mean, I do, anyway. 
  My God, this pot. 
  This pot is really f*cking strong. 
  Is this sativa? 
  You're still sleeping with Felicity. 
  [EXHALES] 
  Hey. 
  It's okay. 
  [SIGHS] 
  It's really okay. 
  I just feel like such a fuckup. 
  No, you're not. 
  I really tried to end it, you know, when I first launched the campaign, but I couldn't. 
  You know? 
  And I-I don't know if I didn't want to hurt her feelings or I didn't want to hurt my feelings, because that would have been a total f*cking free fall. 
  But now now I realize I'm just f*cking sabotaging myself. 
  And it has to be done. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I have to do right by Kit. 
  Yeah. 
  Sometimes I can hear her saying to me - "Girl" - Oh, yeah. 
  "Girl you got to love the life you live [BOTH]
