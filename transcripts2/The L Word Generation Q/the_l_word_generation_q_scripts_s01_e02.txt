  [ALICE] 
  Do you really live in L. A. again? 
  I live in a one-bedroom in Koreatown with five other girls. 
  Well, if you ever need some space, I think there's some extra bedrooms in the back. 
  - Who's that? 
  - My wife. 
  - Sophie Suarez, will you marry me? 
  - Yes. 
  Yes, yes, yes. 
  [NAT] 
  Today's Alice's day to drop off the kids. 
  Oh, sh I'm sorry. 
  Did you want to take them? 
  Oh, no. 
  It's fine. 
  That's not the point. 
  Would you want to grab dinner later? 
  Sounds fun. 
  Yesterday, during a forum, a man publicly accused mayoral candidate Bette Porter of having an affair with his wife. 
  - Is that correct? 
  - That's correct. 
  - [REPORTERS CLAMORING] 
  - Shame on you! 
  Ms. Porter. 
  Bette. 
  Do you know how humiliating it is to be your daughter?

  I am damn good at my job. 
  But I want to work for someone I believe in. 
  And I came here today because I believe in you. 
  You've started your professional life in a compromised industry.

  Can you at least look at me? 
  - Nat? 
  - I thought we were about to get murdered. 
  Is somebody in there? 
  Who is that? 
  - Who are you talking to? 
  - Go home, Gigi. 
  Are you f*cking kidding me? 
  - I said, go home. 
  - Oh, my f*cking God! 
  - Should I be scared? 
  - No, she's mostly harmless. 
  [GIGI] 
  You f*cking bitch! 
  - What is she doing? 
  - Not entirely sure. 
  - She's back.

  Wow. 
  She's really dramatic. 
  - She an actress?

  Wow. 
  Okay, she's f*cking scary. 
  - [ENGINE REVVING] 
  - [TIRES SCREECHING] 
  I am so sorry. 
  This is not at all how I expected our first night to go. 
  Yeah, no, it's fine. 
  It's fine. 
  - Should I go? 
  - No. 
  No. 
  Please don't go. 
  So you were married to that person? 
  Yeah. 
  She's a really great mom. 
  Oh. 
  - Should we ? 
  - I mean, I don't see why not. 
  I keep it juicy juicy, I eat that lunch She keep that booty booty, she keep that plump That natural beauty beauty, yeah, yeah If you could see it from the front, wait till you See it from the back, back, back, back, back Back, back, yeah, back, back, back [SOPHIE] 
  Oh, my God. 
  Okay. 
  I'm inviting my whole family to the engagement party aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins. 
  I mean, you know, it's last minute, so, you know [BOTH LAUGHING] 
  I, uh, pray to God that they don't all come, but when there's free food, odds aren't great. 
  Should I invite Alice? 
  I can't decide what's less weird for her, you know? 
  [EXHALES] 
  I have to tell you something. 
  What is it? 
  I got a new job. 
  - Oh. 
  - I'm going to run PR for Bette Porter's campaign. 
  I get to be a part of something that I actually believe in. 
  Well, you should've talked to me first. 
  Oh. 
  I thought that I thought that you'd be happy for me. 
  And I thought that we were slowing down. 
  Settling into our lives together. 
  - I know I am. 
  - We are, but Yeah, but we talked before I took the job with Alice. 
  Why should this be any different? 
  [MICAH] 
  Guys, listen, I'm taking JosÃ© to Topolino for our first date. 
  You know that fancy place near La Mill? 
  I haven't actually told him this yet, but I got this gift card, you know? 
  So I just thought, like, I might as well just use it on this really cute guy and have, like, a great date. 
  'Cause it wouldn't make sense for me to go with you guys, 'cause I'd be, like, a third wheel, and that'd be weird. 
  And sh1t, that's really dumb, isn't it? 
  That's dumb. 
  - No, no-no-no, it's not that. 
  - Now I'm thinking that we probably shouldn't have our engagement party this week. 
  Of course we should still have it. 
  Yeah, but it might be too much, though. 
  [MICAH] 
  Okay, it smells like stress sweat in here. 
  Is it me? 
  - No. 
  - Yeah. 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  Hey! 
  Morning. 
  You're still here. 
  Yeah. 
  You want some breakfast? 
  I, uh, I picked up some things from the dollar store. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - Oh! 
  And, um, also got you coffee. 
  There you go. 
  How about that? 
  Thanks. 
  It's from one of those packet things. 
  Good, right? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  So, I heard three voices coming from your room last night. 
  - How wasted were you? 
  - I wasn't. 
  Seriously, though, no judgment. 
  I don't think I've ever had sober s*x. 
  I need that liquid courage, you know? 
  Or, like, I can't even tell if someone's into me. 
  Well, just try listening, and they'll tell you. 
  That's deep. 
  [CHUCKLES, SIGHS] 
  I think there there may have been - a little miscommunication. 
  - [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  You want me to get it, or can I finish my sando? 
  All right, yeah. 
  Your house. 
  You get it. 
  What? 
  Yeah, delivery for Shane McCutcheon. 
  No, she's not here. 
  Who was it? 
  What'd he want? 
  Just was curious how long you plan on staying. 
  One week. 
  Two max. 
  You know what, let's not put a max on it. 
  PULSING, DRAMATIC MUSIC [RODOLFO] 
  You needed to see me? 
  Yes. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  How do you like your new office? 
  This place is beautiful. 
  If you need anything special, ask Hector. 
  He'll get you anything you need. 
  Thank you, Pa. 
  Hey. 
  You deserve it, cariÃ±o. 
  You raised me well. 
  Thank you. 
  You raised me to do what's right and to be an independent thinker. 
  And I've worked for you for every day of my adult life, and I couldn't be more grateful. 
  But Bette Porter offered me a position. 
  She wants me to run PR for her campaign. 
  [DANI SIGHS] 
  Can you please say something? 
  What do you want me to say, hmm? 
  You want my blessing, my permission? 
  You're not gonna get it. 
  If you think she has something to offer you - that I haven't given you here - Dad. 
  Take your things. 
  I'll make sure someone walks you out. 
  SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC I proposed to Sophie. 
  So that's good news, at least. 
  That's a lot for one morning. 
  Dad. 
  - Dad, wait. 
  - We're finished here. 
  Just because you have a day off doesn't mean that I have a day off. 
  Good morning. 
  I could have taken care of myself. 
  Well, you've actually proven that's not entirely true. 
  Good morning. 
  Oh, look, that's for me. 
  - Thank you so much. 
  - You're welcome, Ms. 
  Porter. 
  Oh, fantastic. 
  Okay, so, it's mailer day. 
  So, you sit here,  
  - and you're gonna put the  
  - [SIGHS] 
  - Sorry. 
  - Okay. 
  You're gonna put these labels on these mailers. 
  Okay, how long do I have to do this for? 
  Until they're finished. 
  Can Jordi come help? 
  [EXHALES] 
  I don't really want you hanging out with Jordi right now. 
  Why? 
  I didn't ditch because of her. 
  Look, if you want to call one of your classmates to come help you I hate everyone at that f*cking school. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Well, then, I guess you're on your own. 
  Okay. 
  And do me a favor? 
  Take it easy on the f*cking f-bombs, okay? 
  Thank you. 
  ENERGETIC, PERCUSSIVE MUSIC It just rubbed me the wrong way, you know? 
  I feel like she proposed, and then she f*cked up. 
  Are you guys both gonna wear, like, dresses? 
  Why you got to say it like that? 
  I don't know. 
  I'm grossed out. 
  f*ck. 
  You know what's scary? 
  I've never actually seen what a good marriage looks like. 
  My dad left the day my sister was born. 
  Well, my parents kicked me out of the house and sleep in separate beds,  
  - so that's one way to do it. 
  - [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  - Network's here. 
  - [SOPHIE GROANS] 
  - What? 
  - [SOPHIE] 
  Well, we went rogue. 
  - Won't they be pissed? 
  - They can't be. 
  We crushed it. 
  Aren't agents already e-mailing you trying to get their clients on the show? 
  - Yeah. 
  - [ALICE] 
  Yeah. 
  See? 
  They're probably here to celebrate me. 
  Come on. 
  You got this. 
  It's all you. 
  And this is all me. 
  If Porter stands any chance of winning this, she needs to give voters a reason to look past the Felicity Adams scandal. 
  If she can do that remains to be seen. 
  Her favorability Dani. 
  Hi. 
  Great to see you. 
  Excited to be here. 
  Yeah, look, so, I'm just gonna throw you right in. 
  We got a meeting in Bette's office in five minutes. 
  - Okay? 
  - Okay. 
  If you'll just point me to my office so I can put my things down, I'll be right there. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Just take any open desk. 
  It is not that kind of party. 
  SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC Whoa, sorry. 
  - [PHONES RINGING] 
  - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  No, that's okay. 
  [BETTE] 
  It's incredible, right? 
  Judy Chicago loaned it to me. 
  I've always loved her. 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  I'll never forget the first time I saw The Dinner Party. 
  She's always had such a clear mission. 
  You know, like she never deviated from the goal. 
  - It's inspiring. 
  - [EXHALES] 
  - Don't you think? 
  - Yes. 
  Shall we? 
  [BARRY] 
  Bottom line is, and I hate to be the bad guy here, but you can't change your interview guest at the last minute. 
  You can't just interview your friends, right? 
  Well, I thought it went really well. 
  - Didn't you? 
  - [BARRY] 
  You got lucky. 
  When we bought your podcast, we bought a brand. 
  A poppy, fun, palatable lesbian brand. 
  We want to build off that. 
  I do, too. 
  I really do. 
  I It's just I'm a very curious person, and I think my audience is, too. 
  And I just want to give them a little credit. 
  You know, I think we have a real opportunity to make an impact. 
  [BARRY] 
  And we will always be completely open to your ideas. 
  But we got to stay true to our season one audience, right? 
  But they might be interested in something more substantial. 
  [DREW] 
  It's unlikely. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - [ALICE] 
  I'm I Is there ? 
  [BARRY] 
  This is Drew Wilson. 
  - Oh. 
  - [DREW CHUCKLES] 
  Big fan. 
  [BARRY] 
  Drew has written for Seth, Sarah and all the Jimmys. 
  We want you to get to know him, see where he might be useful. 
  Take some of the pressure off you a bit. 
  Let him help maintain the brand that your audience has come to love, okay? 
  I am so sorry to interrupt, but, um Uh, hmm. 
  Yeah, I don't, I don't know what that means. 
  Oh. 
  Ri uh, his school called. 
  - Whose school? 
  - Eli's. 
  Your, uh, stepkid? 
  Oh. 
  Oh. 
  [FINLEY] 
  Yeah, he's sick and, uh, Nat's in session with clients and Gigi's away, I guess? 
  So, um So - so, me, then? 
  - Uh - Looking like it, yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  Everything okay? 
  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  Um, it's a, it's, like, a sick kid. 
  [DREW] 
  Oh. 
  Family comes first. 
  Well, it They don't h-have to, if [BARRY] 
  Well, it's not a problem. 
  - Uh, Drew will fill you in. 
  - Yeah. 
  Um, cool. 
  Well, I am gonna go to school. 
  [SOFT LAUGHTER] 
  Thanks. 
  Thanks. 
  Okay. 
  All right, look, you got to call Shane,  
  - 'cause I am not doing this alone. 
  - Copy that. 
  - And he better be really f*cking sick. 
  - Copy that. 
  [DREW] 
  Uh, so, where were we? 
  I absolutely hear you. 
  We should not have gone over your head. 
  That won't happen again. 
  But we're getting some really interesting interview requests. 
  And we're excited about that, but you can't take big swings like that without our approval. 
  Well, Lena Waithe wants to come on. 
  - She's perfect. 
  - And fun. 
  Uh, maybe we could, uh, play a game with her. 
  Uh, Alice and Lena could, uh, play a drinking game. 
  - We could do it blindfolded. 
  - Yes, yes, yes. 
  - [LAUGHING] 
  - [BABBLING] 
  Yes, and she and Alice could have an honest conversation about the importance of queer representation in film. 
  - Well, sure, sure. 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  Uh, Drew will fill in the details. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Great get, Sophie. 
  [PIERCE] 
  I think we dodged a bullet. 
  If we bring up the affair again, it becomes a self-inflicted wound. 
  I think it's best if we focus on our town hall - at the LGBT Center. 
  - I hear you. 
  I'm concerned if we don't take control of the narrative, it'll bite us in the ass. 
  And what do you propose we do? 
  Get an on-the-record statement from Felicity Adams. 
  She and a mediator are available to come in today. 
  [PIERCE] 
  Wait a minute, you already reached out? 
  Sorry, I thought I was taking point on this. 
  Wait, why would she agree to come here? 
  [DANI] 
  Well, I offered a neutral location, but Felicity seemed fine to come in. 
  I can push back if you want, but I do prefer that we do it on our turf. 
  No, it's-it's fine. 
  [PIERCE] 
  Bette's already given an account of what's happened. 
  [DANI] 
  Yeah, But Felicity hasn't. 
  We want to get ahead of any potential discrepancies in your stories. 
  We need to protect this campaign. 
  [PIERCE] 
  Okay. 
  Let's circle the wagons. 
  - Bring her in here. 
  - Okay. 
  And, uh, take her up the back stairs. 
  I know how to be discreet. 
  But do you know where the back stairs are? 
  No, I don't. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I don't want Angie to be here when she comes in. 
  Kacey is taking a group out to canvass, so she can go with them. 
  Great. 
  Thank you. 
  [DANI] 
  And, looking ahead, is there anything else I need to know? 
  Meaning? 
  Is there anything else people could use against you? 
  You are scheduled to be at Glassell Park Elementary for a photo op in 45 minutes. 
  - Please have the car waiting. 
  - You got it. 
  Um, okay. 
  Well, I spent a night in jail. 
  Uh, civil disobedience. 
  The charges were dropped. 
  Okay. 
  I cheated on my ex-wife. 
  Does she know you were unfaithful? 
  [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  Yes. 
  She knows. 
  - Anything else? 
  - A friend of mine died by suicide on my property. 
  She drowned in my pool. 
  - Her name? 
  - Jenny Schecter. 
  S-C-H-E-C-T-E-R. 
  - Good luck. 
  - Hey, thanks. 
  - Call me if you need me. 
  - [DREW] 
  I will. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Except you won't hear from me at all. 
  Okay, I'll see you. 
  Nobody likes the new guy, right? 
  - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  - But I am excited to be here with you ladies. 
  I'm just here to be helpful. 
  Sure. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'm gonna go find my office. 
  Ah, I-I think it's that way, boss. 
  Definitely not that way. 
  Yeah, that guy's a real bag of dicks. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - [GROANS SOFTLY] 
  I don't want to talk to Dani. 
  I think I need a drink. 
  I'll hang with you. 
  Uh, that's okay. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - I'm-a call my sister. 
  All right? 
  - Okay. 
  All right, I'll just - You take care, buddy. 
  No worries. 
  I'll hydrate. 
  All good here. 
  - [PHONE RINGING] 
  - [SHANE] 
  Okay, okay, buddy. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  Come on, Alice. 
  - The door, get the door. 
  - Alice, focus. 
  - Yeah. 
  What do you need? 
  - Can you get me a bucket? 
  Please. 
  - Like, a what? 
  Like, a - A bucket, Alice. 
  - A bucket. 
  What's a bucket? 
  Are you okay? 
  - Okay, yeah, yeah. 
  [ELI] 
  It hurts! 
  Alice! 
  [SHANE] 
  Come on, Al, hurry up. 
  Please, this is not a drill. 
  He's gonna f*cking blow any second. 
  - [ELI] 
  I'm gonna puke. 
  - Oh, a Crock-Pot? 
  - Would a Crock-Pot do it? 
  - Yes, a Crock-Pot! 
  I don't care. 
  Just get me something. 
  Jesus Christ. 
  - Not my jacket. 
  - Oh, God. 
  Not my jacket, not my jacket. 
  [ELI GROANING] 
  - Oh, God. 
  - Oh, my God! 
  Okay. 
  Oh, God. 
  - Okay - Mm-hmm. 
  Oh, God, that smells so bad. 
  I want Mama. 
  Oh, yeah, no, I want her, too. 
  I know, I know, I know. 
  Can you get me a rag? 
  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. 
  Okay. 
  - For the f*cking kid, not for you. 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  You okay? 
  It's gonna be all right, all right? 
  It's gonna be all right, all right? 
  Mommy's gonna come home tonight. 
  Yeah. 
  Your mommy's gonna come home tonight. 
  Did you get it all out? 
  - Did you get it all out? 
  - What are you doing? 
  - I-I, I d-don't know. 
  - You want to go lay down? 
  Yeah? 
  All right. 
  You show me your favorite spot on the couch, all right? 
  - [ALICE] 
  Okay. 
  - Here, just Yeah, mm-hmm. 
  Okay. 
  [SHANE] 
  All right. 
  Uh - Is who is that? 
  - Hmm? 
  Oh, he loves it. 
  - He loves it. 
  - Yeah? 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  There you go. 
  How's that? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  That's good. 
  - Is that good? 
  All right. 
  All right. 
  [SIGHS HEAVILY] 
  - [EXHALES] 
  - You okay? 
  [WHISPERING] 
  How are you doing this? 
  - It's crazy. 
  - I mean kids are people. 
  But they're not. 
  They're, like, they're, like, half-sized. 
  They're, like, half-people. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Well, I'm glad you called me, Al. 
  You should have had kids with Quiara. 
  You're really good at it. 
  [GRUNTS SOFTLY] 
  I'm surprised she didn't convince you. 
  She didn't. 
  You miss her that bad, huh? 
  Oh, I'm okay. 
  [BETTE] 
  Alice, I'm so sorry. 
  Yeah, that's never fun. 
  Yeah, but the Crock-Pot, that was a, that was a creative solution. 
  Yeah, you know I would come, I just, I'm-I'm still here at the office. 
  I'm waiting to see how this goes. 
  - Yes. 
  She's here. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - Thanks for coming in. 
  - Don't be silly. 
  I'll be fine. 
  Let me know if you need anything else. 
  SLOW, SOMBER MUSIC  
  [FOOTSTEPS ECHOING] 
  What? 
  Yeah, no, I'm no, I'm here, I'm here.

  Go on. 
  [SPEAKING SPANISH] 
  [VIRGINIA] 
  Sophie, where do you and Dani keep your good wine? 
  [SOPHIE] 
  There's a bottle in the fridge. 
  - [SPEAKS SPANISH]

  [MARIBEL] 
  Oh, my God, girl, I can't believe you're getting married. 
  I know. 
  - [ALL EXCLAIMING] 
  - No, no, no. 
  [SPEAKS SPANISH] 
  - [SOPHIE] 
  Para mi, sÃ­. 
  Gracias. 
  - How did she propose? 
  - Hmm. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Did she get down on one knee? 
  I love a good proposal. 
  [VIRGINIA] 
  You're gonna look so good in a white suit. 
  What do you think I should do with my hair?

  Yeah, Tess is always trying to, um, buy out the owners, turn it back to what it used to be. 
  - She should. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, what we could do is just rip the f*cking TVs out, switch the menu up and clean the place up. 
  You know, it would be the only lesbian bar in the city? 
  Only one. 
  Well, then someone should just buy it and you guys run it.

  Well, our parents, our parents kick us out. 
  Religious leaders shame us. 
  And our so-called "friends" abandon us.

  That's her loss. 
  Really.

  Eli hasn't been sick like that since he was a baby.

  So you and Mona were doing it? 
  We were. 
  - And then the baby threw you under the bus? 
  - He did. 
  Well, I am surprised you could ever forgive him.

  And you're strong enough to leave if you need to. 
  You know that. 
  - [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  - But it takes - it takes true strength to stay. 
  - Hmm. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - This is a celebration time. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Let's go to the party. 
  Come on. 
  ["AUTE CUTURE" BY ROSALA PLAYING] 
  Dude, Sophie's grandma can cook. 
  Yeah. 
  Hey, hand me a napkin? 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  I didn't think she was gonna text me. 
  - That's cool. 
  - Who? 
  Girl from last night, Rebecca. 
  f*ck, I should've invited him. 
  [FINLEY] 
  Dude, next time. 
  - These have to be our last ones. 
  - Yeah, you're right. 
  I want to be drunk, but not like dizzy drunk for this girl, you know? 
  Salud. 
  Mmm. 
  Catch you on the flip side. 
  [SHOUTS] 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Hey, everyone. 
  Everybody. 
  Uh, if I could get, uh, everyone's attention for a second, um Thank you so much for being here tonight. 
  You are all so beautiful I could just cry, - but I won't. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  My two favorite people in the entire world are getting married and rather than, uh, butcher this moment with my own very questionable wisdom, I dug up something by one of Sophie's favorite poets, Alix Olson. 
  - [MOUTHS] 
  I love you. 
  - "Living, we have learned, can be both sloppy and precise. 
  And so, you choose your careful witness to your silly little life. 
  You begin to trace each other's journeys, you begin to chart each other's pace. 
  You start to notice all the sweetness and the details of their ways. 
  Because loving seeks a language of solace. 
  It speaks volumes about tomorrow when you are fluent in forgiveness. 
  Sometimes familiar becomes magic. 
  Sometimes magic needs distance. 
  Sometimes space is what shapes it. 
  And the shape is not instant. 
  Sometimes the horizon's surprising. 
  And the view is worth risking. 
  And the risk is a long wait, but this girl is persistent. 
  Sometimes a future just means that each day is worth finding. 
  And this day is a presence, and this moment is shining. 
  [MOANING] 
  Sometimes her prayers are just soothing. 
  Sometimes her face is just lovely. 
  Years, years spent searching. 
  Sometimes people get lucky". 
  So, cheers to Dani and Sophie. 
  We are all - so happy for you. 
  - [CHEERING] 
  Love you guys. 
  Opa! 
  ["OJOS DEL SOL" BY Y LA BAMBA PLAYING] 
  [QUIETLY] 
  I love you. 
  - [CHEERING] 
  - [WHISTLING] 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  - Come on, give me a little turn. 
  Show me. 
  [GROWLS] 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] 
  - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  Thanks for meeting me. 
  I'm glad you called. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I miss you. 
  I miss you, too. 
  You hold me down in the best way No quarter from These chains that I slapped on my heart for a feeling Why can't I let my demons lie? 
  Keep screaming into the pillow 'Cause your taste still gets me stupid high Oh, glory, I'm a believer Oh, glory, I'm a trier, but Wild horses Wild horses Wild horses run faster Run faster, run faster! 
  Lena, this is Bette and Alice. 
  Really good to meet you both. 
  - Stop. 
  - I didn't say anything. 
  - What's better than this? 
  - Nothing. 
  And then she is like, "Oh, I gotta go to church", on a Tuesday. 
  I'm happy to compromise with you. 
  I'm just not about to compromise with your dad. 
  You and Nat, could go get coffee. 
  Did she tell you to say that? 
  She misses you. 
  I brought two best friends back together. 
  Two or twice?
