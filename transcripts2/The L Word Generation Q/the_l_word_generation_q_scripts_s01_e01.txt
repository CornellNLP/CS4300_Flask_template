  Thank you. 
  I don't live here. 
  You know what? 
  I'll come down in a bit.

  Hello again. 
  - [PIERCE] 
  So sorry to rush you, but the graphics team needs an answer. 
  Do you like the adjustments they made? 
  Yeah, that equal sign in the E is brilliant, actually. 
  Okay, good. 
  I'll let them know you're happy, and we'll get them ready for the rally tonight.

  Thank you. 
  You know, when I was a kid, uh, my mom made me split a SlimFast shake with her for breakfast. 
  You're not our mom. 
  Oh, yeah, no, I sure do know that. 
  - Hi, hi, hi. 
  - Hi. 
  What's happening? 
  Today's Alice's day to drop off the kids. 
  Oh, sh I'm sorry.

  It's great.

  The schedule is in your calendar. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  I didn't see it. 
  - Yes, you did. 
  - Did you want to take them? 
  - Oh, no. 
  It's fine. 
  - That's not the point. 
  - No, but it really is fine. 
  No, it's really not fine. 
  It's not a big deal if she wants to take them. 
  - I - I'm okay if you're okay. 
  Yeah, and I'm the same. 
  - Both are good. 
  - None of this is good. 
  I want to go with Mom. 
  Great. 
  Problem solver. 
  It's good. 
  Are you sure? 
  - [NAT] 
  No. 
  - Yeah. 
  Really.

  Have fun. 
  - Okay. 
  Bye. 
  - Bye. 
  - I still see you. 
  - Do we do the whole time? 
  What a f*cking bitch. 
  Oh, I thought w Oh, you're serious? 
  Yeah. 
  I mean, she can't just come into our home and take over like that. 
  Well, it used to be her home, is the thing. 
  Can you please commiserate rather than rationalize? 
  Oh, Nat, I don't want to do therapist-speak. 
  Okay, she can't barge in here anymore. 
  I'm gonna call her - and tell her to - No, no, no, no. 
  If you do that, then she'll tell the kids, they'll hate exactly one person. 
  That's this guy. 
  I just want you to feel like you're part of this family. 
  Because you are. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You're cute. 
  - Yeah - I'm serious. 
  I know. 
  And you're cute. 
  Can we talk about something else now? 
  What time do you have to leave? 
  Seven minutes. 
  Do you want to see if we can do it in six? 
  - Yes, I do. 
  - Yes.

  [FINLEY] 
  You know the bartender from Black? 
  - [SOPHIE] 
  Oh, mm-hmm. 
  - She broke up  
  - with her boyfriend. 
  - Yeah. 
  And last night, I finally get a text from her. 
  And she's like, "U up?" And I'm like, "For you, Kween? 
  Yaas". 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Oh, yeah? 
  Did you say it just like that? 
  I texted it, but yeah. 
  Problem is, I only have enough gas in my car for a one-way trip to the Eastside. 
  So, I go over there, we fudge it is awesome but this morning, I snuck out, left my car, stole her bike  
  - Look at us. 
  - [TIRES SCREECH] 
  Still to work on time and sh1t, though. 
  [WHOOPS] 
  Your shirt's on backwards. 
  Balls. 
  You could give the woman her bike back. 
  Dude, I absolutely cannot do that. 
  That's so freakin' embarrassing. 
  - Morning, boss. 
  - Hey. 
  Morning. 
  Uh ooh, coffee. 
  Uh, hey, Alice, can I get five minutes? 
  Oh, no, I can't right now. 
  I have a brunch. 
  Well, I have a new guest idea I want to pitch. 
  Okay, and I want to hear it, so I'm gonna see you  
  - in the writers room at 1:00. 
  - Great. 
  I'll see you then. 
  What are these doing on my desk? 
  The art department wants you to choose the hero mug. 
  You want one lip or three lips? 
  I think they're mouth lips, but they could be v*g1n* lips. 
  Really, there's no way to tell at this point. 
  I like the three. 
  Does it block my face? 
  Is it too big? 
  - No, it's great. 
  - I like that one. 
  I'll let them know. 
  Sign that, please. 
  - [ALICE] 
  Okay. 
  - [SLOW CLAP] 
  [SCREAMS] 
  You're here! 
  [SQUEALS] 
  - [SHANE] 
  I'm here. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Here! 
  I can't believe you're really here. 
  Look at you. 
  Do you really live in L. A. again? 
  [SHOUTS] 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Hi. 
  - Look at this face. 
  - I miss this face. 
  - Ugh Oh, Finley. 
  Shane. 
  - Shane, Finley. 
  - How are you? 
  Hey, how are you? 
  This is just absolutely incredible. 
  - You think? 
  - Yeah. 
  Look what you did for yourself. 
  It's outstanding. 
  Oh, man. 
  This doesn't seem real, that you're back. 
  It's like, "Ah!" you know? 
  I promise you it's real. 
  But it doesn't feel real, I know. 
  Okay, I'm starving. 
  Can we go eat, and I'm gonna  
  - show you everything later? 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh, the little see the puppet people, though? 
  - Is that  
  - Come on, come on, come on. 
  I'll show you later. 
  Wait. 
  Wait, but but you sold the salon in Paris? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  What about the one  
  - in New York? 
  - Got rid of it, too. 
  So what are you gonna do now? 
  I don't know. 
  - Okay. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  - Okay. 
  - Do you like your new house? 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, it's, uh, it's good. 
  It's empty. 
  Let's send a bed to her house. 
  - Oh, absolutely. 
  - No, no, I can do that myself. 
  No, of course you can, but you won't. 
  I'll have Finley come help you. 
  - I don't need it. 
  - It's already done. 
  So, are you happy you're back at least? 
  Yeah. 
  I am. 
  Mm. 
  What the f*ck spilled in here? 
  - Don't look at me like that. 
  - I can look at you any way I want to look at you. 
  Have you spoken to her yet? 
  No. 
  I don't, I don't plan to. 
  Well, you know, I'm just asking you 'cause I missed you. 
  And, in all honesty, I believe I missed you more. 
  Oh, no, no, no, no. 
  I missed you more. 
  Mm-mm. 
  It's not a contest. 
  It is, and I'm gonna win. 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  I'm parenting, Shane. 
  It's a whole thing. 
  You know, and you're doing great. 
  You're doing great. 
  You know, I'm still stepping on those Legos, and those things are f*cking deadly. 
  You should switch to Lincoln Logs. 
  They're way less hazardous. 
  Oh, my God, 'cause they're round. 
  Wait, what, wait, why couldn't you all have just moved into your place? 
  Well, that wouldn't solve the problem 'cause the kids would still have to come with us. 
  - Mm. 
  - But, you know, my mom's still living in my house, so it's fine. 
  - And how is Lenore? 
  - Oh, stop. 
  - What? 
  - No. 
  Really. 
  Are you trying to f*ck my mom? 
  I'm-I'm asking you how she is. 
  I can't believe you still want to f*ck my mom. 
  - [CELL PHONE BUZZES] 
  - Excuse me. 
  She's an attractive woman, Alice. 
  Yeah, I-I'm at breakfast. 
  It's not really a good time. 
  Can I call you back? 
  [BOTH] 
  Tina. 
  ["TIME FLIES" BY RICO NASTY] 
  I don't want to be On the ground when the time flies Had so many friends going, "Wonder when it's my time" I live every day like I'll die by the nighttime It took me so long getting back to my right mind vision of race and class hold up in modern times? 
  And how does race dictate what happens to characters in the book? 
  Okay, when analyzing the characters in "Don Quixote", these are the questions I need you guys to keep coming back to. 
  Just like last week when One second. 
  Thanks. 
  Okay. 
  Uh, let's everybody write a paragraph on what Don Quixote wants when the story begins. 
  Hey, Angie, can you grab your things, go see Mr. Bennet? 
  - Okay. 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm sorry your grandma's unwell. 
  Thanks. 
  I lost my grandma when I was much younger than you and I always felt like I didn't get to say what I needed to say to her. 
  That's her. 
  - That's my cousin. 
  - Okay. 
  [LOUD RAP MUSIC PLAYING] 
  - Yes. 
  - Okay. 
  Well, I hope your grandma feels better. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Thank you, thank you.

  Tina, stop worrying. 
  Four AP classes and a school play is not too much. 
  She can handle it. 
  All right, if she falls behind, we'll just get her a tutor. 
  She's a smart kid, she'll be fine. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Yes, I will say it nicer than that. 
  Okay. 
  Bye, Tina. 
  Hey, everybody. 
  Hey. 
  So, we have several potential donor meetings set up for today. 
  Every name on the list carries tremendous weight within their communities, and all were instrumental in electing Garcetti. 
  So they're "friends of the party"? 
  Got to love the dog and pony show. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  I took another stab at your speech for the outreach forum tonight. 
  It's in your inbox. 
  Great. 
  If you could get me a hard copy on my desk, I'll make - notes as soon as possible. 
  - Perfect. 
  Ms. Porter, here are the specs for the Green New Deal. 
  Thank you, Allie. 
  All right, first up, Rodolfo NÃ¹Ã±ez, President of NÃ¹Ã±ez Inc. , an L. A. 
  -based, minority-owned investment company with a philanthropic reputation. 
  He's got pull in both the Latinx and the Persian communities. 
  Jesus. 
  That's half the city. 
  Exactly. 
  [KATIE] 
  Dani. 
  Your father got pulled away and he can't take his next meeting. 
  What happened? 
  He didn't say, but he asked that you take his 2:00 p. m. 
  - in the conference room. 
  - Who's in there? 
  Mayoral candidate Bette Porter. 
  Isn't she trailing Milner? 
  She is, but she's poised to close the gap. 
  With me. 
  If elected then Porter'll be L. A. 's first female mayor. 
  She's also the first openly gay candidate. 
  Her views are very progressive. 
  Ms. Porter. 
  Dani NÃ¹Ã±ez, Director of Communications. 
  Pleasure to meet you. 
  This is Pierce Williams, my campaign manager. 
  Yeah, I believe we met on Garcetti's first bid. 
  - Yes. 
  Good to see you again. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Likewise. 
  My father's deeply sorry, but he won't be able to make it. 
  Oh, well, I hope everything's okay. 
  I'm sure it will be. 
  Please, have a seat. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  So you work for your father? 
  I do. 
  I like to think I was bred for the job. 
  I studied Communications at Stanford and then I did my graduate work at USC, but it is possible there was some nepotism involved, if that's what you're thinking. 
  [PRODUCER] 
  You feel close? 
  Do you feel it? 
  [ALICE] 
  No. 
  No. 
  None of them are right. 
  No. 
  - They don't feel like me. 
  - At least Dr. 
  Oz is a vaginal steaming advocate. 
  I did vaginal rejuvenation in '04. 
  Have vaginas changed since then? 
  No, they have not. 
  - No. 
  - I know it sucks, but, hopefully, if we give the network this win, they'll be more inclined to allow us to stretch to include more politically-minded candidates. 
  Right, like my beloved Roxane Gay. 
  Exactly. 
  I got a phone call this morning from an old friend of mine from grad school. 
  She's working as an aide to a very interesting person. 
  Okay, listening. 
  The network wants to broaden our demographic. 
  They want to attract a more far-reaching audience, right? 
  Alice wants to keep it queer, queer-adjacent, uh, social, political. 
  Who's it gonna be? 
  I smell an Obama coming. 
  Kamala. 
  Can you get her? 
  Yeah. 
  I interviewed her for a documentary I made on criminal justice reform back when she was a D. A. 
  This is amazing. 
  You have to book her. 
  I cannot wait to ask her real but also inappropriate questions. 
  - Right? 
  - Oh, my God. 
  I'm so glad you're here this season. 
  It's all happening. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'll keep Dr. 
  Oz warm, just as a backup. 
  - Okay, we're not. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  Okay, let's get some questions. 
  Let's go. 
  We want to convert the Lincoln Heights Jail to expand our corporate offices. 
  We know it's been a hotly contested area, but we do have capital in place to invest in a project of that scale. 
  I just, I have to ask: What's the source of your capital? 
  My father's political contributions, they're made through our foundation, entirely separate from our family's company. 
  I don't think you answered the question. 
  We have a diverse portfolio. 
  Investments in everything from biomedical research to agriculture And the funding for the biomedical research, does that come from the sale of pharmaceuticals? 
  We design prosthetics for Wounded Warriors, Ms. 
  Porter. 
  I understand, but do you also invest in the production of opioids? 
  Prosthetics don't pay for themselves. 
  I see. 
  Our only interest here is finding the best person to run this city, and we believe that person is you. 
  I'm not buying what you're selling. 
  Our current mayor bought it. 
  I'm not him. 
  Ms. 
  Porter. 
  Do you know why I'm running for office? 
  I can't say that I do. 
  It's because of people like you. 
  The products you're pushing are the cause of suffering. 
  They have contributed to the worst opioid crisis our city has ever faced, and that property that you want to turn into corporate offices, that could be used as a long-term rehab facility. 
  And while I might understand the willful ignorance of a straight white man, I'm having a hard time understanding how you could turn a blind eye. 
  So I guess what I really want to know is how the hell do you sleep at night?

  - Where were you, Dad? 
  - We have a problem. 
  What is it? 
  One of our employees' son's overdosed. 
  You're going to take point on this. 
  Get ahead of it as much as you can. 
  I need you to handle him for us. 
  - I understand. 
  - Okay. 
  [DANI] 
  Jack. 
  - Hi. 
  - I can't believe this. 
  I just saw him, and he'd been clean, and  
  - I did this. 
  - No, you didn't. 
  Yeah, I did. 
  We did. 
  I mean - this is all our fault. 
  - Jack. 
  Stop. 
  Sit down.

  That is exactly what the media wants you to think. 
  They'll try to connect your work here with your son's death. 
  But they're wrong.

  We are not the bad guys. 
  Me, you, my father? 
  We are a family, too. 
  You can't let them tear us apart. 
  Yeah, I know, I know, but what we do here Stop. 
  Listen to me. 
  Your son cannot be a statistic. 
  He was a person. 
  He was your son. 
  Yeah, he was. 
  He was my little boy. 
  Exactly. 
  You're right. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Now tell me, what did he love to do? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Uh Mikey was a person. 
  He was not a salacious news story. 
  He loved life. 
  He loved to fish, play chess. 
  [REPORTER] 
  Please believe me when I say that I am deeply sorry for your loss. 
  [JACK] 
  He was funny, and he was loved. 
  Mikey was special. 
  He's handling this very well. 
  Mm-mm. 
  That's not him. 
  That's the woman you met earlier. 
  He's been coached. 
  Too bad she works for the wrong side. 
  [JACK] 
  death of my son was a tragedy that has nothing to do with my work.

  And the government, the government is meant to help in times like these.

  She slept with an employee. 
  - It was consensual. 
  - But she was married. 
  Okay, so I f*cked up. 
  I think it's because you're gay. 
  Well, I think the problem is Felicity's gay and it makes her husband feel like less of a man, I mean, whatever that means. 
  That makes the most sense. 
  But they're trying to paint you like these male predators.

  Because I didn't get that memo. 
  - I think we should. 
  Yeah. 
  - Well, I missed that. 
  [ALICE] 
  All right, let's dig in. 
  So, in case you've been living under a rock, yesterday during a forum, a man who's since been identified as Tyler Adams publicly accused mayoral candidate Bette Porter of having an affair with his wife. 
  - Is that correct? 
  - That's correct. 
  So why did you want to come on the show today? 
  I mean, why not let something like that just kind of blow over? 
  Well, because I won't be shamed into silence. 
  I mean, historically, that's what happens to women in my position. 
  We're shamed and then we stand down, but I won't. 
  - Not now, not ever. 
  - [AUDIENCE CHEERING] 
  [ALICE] 
  So, are you sorry that you slept with a married woman? 
  Well, it's tricky because I-I I don't want anyone to think that I'm okay with causing another person pain, because I'm not. 
  But I also don't want it to seem like I'm apologizing for having a relationship with a consenting adult because that's also a message that I'm not comfortable sending. 
  So you're not sorry? 
  I think I answered the question. 
  It's not that that simple. 
  Ugh. 
  It's getting a little hot in here. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  - [GRUNTS SOFTLY] 
  Can I just tell you the most frustrating part of this whole ordeal? 
  - Please. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  I mean, it's distracting. 
  People would rather focus on what's titillating than stare death in the face. 
  And the fact is, our city is in crisis and people are dying. 
  [ALICE] 
  I know that you have a very real reason that you're running. 
  A very personal reason. 
  Why won't you talk about it?

  Well, um I'm a woman. 
  I'm gay, I'm biracial. 
  Um, I'm a mother to an extraordinary daughter. 
  I'm an ex-wife, uh, a friend. 
  I think I'm a really loyal friend. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Yeah.

  Uh, I'm a daughter, I'm-I'm a sister.

  You know, I'm that part of you that wants to do better. 
  I'm that part of you that loves this city and wants to see all of its communities thrive. 
  I'm that part of you that makes mistakes. 
  And I know I've disappointed people that I love. 
  And that's not a mistake that I want to make again. 
  And I hope that my indiscretions don't cloud my greater purpose, because while I know
