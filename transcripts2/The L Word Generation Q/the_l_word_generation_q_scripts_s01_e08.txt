 - Yay! 
  - I told you! 
  I love seeing you like this. 
  - I'm in. 
  - You know who's mean? 
  - Who? 
  - Dani. 
  She processes everything alone. 
  I mean, how do I get her to open up to me? 
  Milner's team bought up a ton of airtime. 
  I'm hearing that it's going to be a negative attack campaign. 
  Your job is to help me shape my message and get it out into the world. 
  There are a lot of voices in the room. 
  So, I would like to make some changes. 
  Quite frankly, we don't know if there will be a next season. 
  We need a viral video. 
  Are you ready to hear your baby's heartbeat? 
  Oh, my God. 
  Today was really hard. 
  I didn't feel anything. 
  Aren't you scared just a little bit? 
  No. 
  You were wondering if I could get over the whole priest thing. 
  Well, I can, because you're not a real priest. 
  You have deep wounds. 
  And I don't know who hurt you, but somebody did. 
  I can't really talk right now. 
  I'm at your sister's engagement party. 
  Faith's getting married? 
  Have you told that sweet boy that you love him yet? 
  'Cause he loves you, too. 
  They were f*cking, Shane! 
  Throuples are complicated, Al. 
  I don't want to lose her. 
  You know, we've spent the last few days, Gigi and I, really getting into our issues. 
  I'm so glad I could be there to help push you guys towards hashing out your divorce. 
  - So, I'm gonna go. 
  - What happened? 
  - Oh, my grandma fell. 
  - Come here. 
  Come here. 
  I think you should have been there for her today. 
  She really needed you. 
  She knows I'm f*cking tapped out right now. 
  I-I'm giving her all I've got. 
  You're, like, the best part of my day. 
  I love the sh1t out of you. 
  What are you doing, buddy? 
  What are you doing? 
  Tonight's the night, and you can certainly feel the excitement out here. 
  Bette Porter's campaign has had quite a few bumps in the road, but people have really responded to her commitment to address the opioid crisis head-on. 
  Now, if Porter wins tonight, she not only would be the first woman elected to this office, but also the first openly gay mayor of the city. 
  It would truly be an historic day for Los Angeles. 
  The polls are about to close, and members of our team will be here Okay, everyone. 
  Here we go. 
  Polls are closed. 
  Make sure you're all on the registrar's website. 
  We hit the doors in CD 11. 
  I know that we phoned our voters this past weekend, but how many did we pull to vote? 
  I don't have any hard numbers, - but we're doing all we can. 
  - Well, I need numbers. 
  Go get me the numbers. 
  - You all good? 
  - Yeah. 
  All we can do is wait. 
  Good luck, Ms. 
  Porter. 
  Thank you, everybody. 
  Thank you. 
  - You got this. 
  - Good luck. 
  All right, ladies, gentlemen, all you gender nonconforming folks out there. 
  Are you ready to welcome the guest of honor this evening? 
  Your next mayor of Los Angeles, Bette Porter! 
  Baby You won't be messing a good thing Good luck, Bette! 
  Hi, everyone. 
  With the break of day Oh, my goodness. 
  You're not like them other men Aw, this is so sweet. 
  Hey. 
  Ah, Ms. Porter. 
  Recent polls are increasingly in your favor. 
  Would you say that you're taking this last-minute ascent as a good sign? 
  Well, you and I both know never to trust the polls. 
  Right, Maya? 
  But I have to say we are cautiously optimistic. 
  But, come on. 
  I mean, off the record, you have to admit this is really exciting. 
  Well, I-I have to admit, um absolutely nothing. 
  - No. 
  - Ugh, we're looking for me. 
  What about her? 
  No. 
  I can't believe I went from the greatest girlfriend to two girlfriends to no girlfriends. 
  - What about her? 
  - No. 
  - No? 
  - No. 
  - Give her a chance! 
  - No. 
  Please, trust me. 
  - Okay. 
  - No. 
  Ah, what about her? 
  What about her? 
  - Oh, she's cute. 
  Okay, okay. 
  - No, I like her, I like her. 
  If we'd kept our wildest dreams What? 
  Every picture's with a parakeet. 
  So what's wrong with a bird? 
  I don't know if I'm ready for birds. 
  They're so chatty. 
  All right, all right, all right, all right. 
  What? 
  Check out the woman at your twelve o'clock. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  All right, I'll be sly. 
  - That is your six. 
  - Oh. 
  I don't know clocks, okay? 
  - Everything's digital now. 
  - Hey, you guys. 
  - Hi. 
  - Angie's on her way. 
  I told her to find you two when, when she gets here. 
  - Yeah, of course, of course. 
  - We got her. 
  - Okay. 
  - Hi. 
  Who is it? 
  Wait, what? 
  Are you okay? 
  - Um - Are you okay? 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  Um, I-I-I'll be back soon. 
  - I-I-I'll call you. 
  - Okay. 
  Are you already home? 
  Hey, Bette. 
  What do you think of her? 
  Is that a parakeet? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Is that a thing? 
  Uh, they called the 11th District for you. 
  Wait, what? 
  Are you a-are you sure? 
  I mean, we weren't polling very well on the Westside. 
  - And Milner was supposed to have a  
  - I'm sure. 
  I'm sure of it. 
  The county registrar just reported it. 
  Bette. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  - We can actually win this thing. 
  - Yeah, well, that was the goal, right? 
  - Right. 
  - Yeah. 
  Hey. 
  - Hi. 
  - It's good to see you. 
  You, too. 
  Congratulations on the whole campaign. 
  Oh, thank you so much. 
  I mean, it's all her. 
  Hey, you're young, let me ask you a question. 
  What do you think of her? 
  I dated her. 
  The birds were her whole thing. 
  Oh. 
  We are outside the Porter campaign's official watch party, where we are able to confirm now that Bette Porter has won the 11th District. 
  Once again, the 11th District has been confirmed of going to Bette Porter, while Milner takes the 2nd, and this race is still too close to call. 
  Stay tuned for further results. 
  Feeling like a stranger I am afraid of it When it's too hard When I am in danger The feelings get much stranger Soph. 
  Hey. 
  - Hi. 
  Oh - Hello, gorgeous. 
  Mwah. 
  Oh, I like this. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Look at you together. 
  Guys, hi. 
  Hi, baby. 
  Oh, I'm so glad you're here. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yes. 
  You look beautiful. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, this looks amazing. 
  - Wow. 
  Yeah. 
  - Thank you. 
  Thank you. 
  Except that I have literally never been this nervous before in my life. 
  Like, I could puke any second. 
  Hey, hey, look at me. 
  - Hmm? 
  - I am so proud of you. 
  No matter what happens, all right? 
  Thank you. 
  Yeah. 
  This is cute. 
  Oh, f*ck. 
  How did we lose the 13th? 
  Feeling like a stranger Mm, that was nice while it lasted. 
  You'll get her back in, like, three hours. 
  Ooh, yeah, I'm not gonna hold my breath. 
  Okay, please, can we see a preview before your opening tomorrow night? 
  No, you're gonna have to wait like everyone else. 
  It's a painting of me. 
  All right, doesn't that entitle me to some - advanced viewing? 
  Right? 
  - No. 
  Hey. 
  I didn't know if you guys wanted limes, but, uh, I thought they looked fancy. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Thank you. 
  Also, no straws because the planet. 
  Can I talk to you for a second? 
  Y sure. 
  Everything okay? 
  - Never better. 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Men run round like a bad thing comin' Bad thing comin' Excuse us. 
  - Hey, boss. 
  - Hey, boss. 
  - Hey-hey. 
  - Oh. 
  Hey! 
  Hi. 
  Take my pills but I still get sicker Still get sicker So what do you think? 
  You think she'll win? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, me, too. 
  You know, I don't think I've ever seen her lose anything. 
  Like, not even her keys. 
  Uh-huh. 
  Can I ask you something? 
  Oh. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, sure. 
  What's up? 
  When did you lose your virginity? 
  Mm. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Okay. 
  Um I haven't yet. 
  I know you're lying. 
  Okay, yeah. 
  I was, um I was, like, 37. 
  You know what? 
  - I'll just ask Shane. 
  I think that's perfect. 
  - No. 
  - No? 
  - No. 
  No, I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk. 
  Okay, uh, whew. 
  Well I was 17, and it was with this guy who played my mom's son in a movie of the week. 
  So that was a little weird. 
  What's a "movie of the week"? 
  That was your takeaway? 
  From what I just said? 
  I guess I just figured that you'd, um yeah, that you'd never want to talk about it. 
  Yeah. 
  No, that's, like, definitely my move for sure. 
  But I don't know, I can be kind of a sh1t storm for people. 
  No. 
  You're not a sh1t storm. 
  No, I can be, and I just, like, don't really, really don't want to do that to you. 
  And I know you love Dani, and I just, I promise that none of whatever happened is gonna mess any of that up, okay? 
  Let's just, like, undo it. 
  Okay. 
  Just, like, a "select all", "delete" sort of situation. 
  I don't even know if that's right. 
  It's just - No, I - I'm not a big typer. 
  - Okay. 
  - I'm just talking words at you. 
  - Totally get it. 
  - Okay. 
  Yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  - Yeah. 
  So we're good. 
  Yeah, we're so good. 
  - Awesome. 
  - Yeah. 
  All right, I'm gonna go, I don't know make drinks with limes. 
  - All right. 
  - I'll see you in there. 
  Oh, f*ck. 
  - Hey. 
  Hi. 
  Are you okay? 
  - Hey. 
  - Did the bleeding stop? 
  - Not completely, but, um Okay, okay, okay. 
  How long have you been waiting? 
  Not that long. 
  They said it shouldn't be any more than ten minutes. 
  Okay, hold on. 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Excuse me. 
  Hi. 
  Is there a reason you're making my pregnant wife wait - to see a doctor? 
  - Ma'am, there's a process that we have. 
  - We have to go in the order that - Look, no, I-I underst I understand your process, but she's bleeding, so she doesn't have time for that. 
  - Babe, no, seriously, it's not - Hold on, honey. 
  I got this. 
  Did you hear what I said? 
  Yes. 
  We will call you up in just a moment, but if you'll just please Lady, she's not gonna f*cking wait for a doctor, so please go get one. 
  Hey. 
  Okay. 
  - All right  
  - I'm fine. 
  - It's okay. 
  - You sure? 
  All right, the doctor's, I think  
  - I think she's getting him. 
  - Okay. 
  I mean, it's just it's normal. 
  Is it? 
  Yeah. 
  I-I hear women, you know, they bleed early, and it's-it's just spotting. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay? 
  It's fine. 
  So, we've done well in the 5th. 
  If we get that, we just need one more. 
  The 3rd or the 14th. 
  Our numbers in the 5th are slipping. 
  Those negative ads really hurt her. 
  - I know. 
  - Polls as recent as yesterday have Jeff Milner leading Porter in all three of the remaining districts. 
  Porter's only path to victory is to win the 5th, where she has struggled since Milner's onslaught of negative ads were released. 
  Okay, I know. 
  And Garcetti won the 14th with 68% of the vote last time which leaves us with the 3rd. 
  - Maybe if we get the 3rd, we - Dani. 
  Dani. 
  We won the 5th. 
  We won the 5th? 
  We won - Oh, my God. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my oh, my God, we won the 5th. 
  We won we won the 5th! 
  We won the we won we won the 5th! 
  We won the 5th. 
  Bette, we've won the 5th. 
  The 5th? 
  You're kidding. 
  Just one more. 
  One more. 
  The celebration for the Porter campaign has proven to be short-lived. 
  Can you just give us a few minutes, please? 
  The registrar is now ready to call the 3rd District for Jeff Milner. 
  That means, with only one district remaining, this race has proven closer than anyone expected. 
  For both sides it all comes down - to the 14th District. 
  - Sorry, do, do you, do you want a glass of water or something? 
  - Oh, no, no, God, no. 
  - Okay. 
  Yeah. 
  The energy, I think, on both sides is shifting a bit. 
  It feels like both of the camps - are kind of holding their breath - as the results continue to roll very slowly in. 
  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. 
  Come on. 
  - May I? 
  - Yeah. 
  Go ahead. 
  - Let me just  
  - Yeah. 
  Oh, f*ck. 
  sh1t. 
  - Jeff Milner will be  
  - the next mayor of Los Angeles. 
  f*ck. 
  I'm sorry, okay? 
  I-I, I did everything that I could. 
  I I'm so sorry. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  All right? 
  You did a great job. 
  Hmm. 
  You did a great job. 
  I need to go talk to everybody. 
  Okay, I got to go find Angie. 
  Okay. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  Come on. 
  It's okay. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you, everyone. 
  I know you're disappointed. 
  I'm disappointed, too. 
  How you feeling? 
  Want some tea? 
  All right, well, I'll make some, just in case. 
  Holy sh1t, you're still here. 
  Yeah. 
  - Can you believe it? 
  - Not really. 
  What are you gonna do today? 
  Nothing. 
  Oh, bullshit. 
  You don't know how to do nothing. 
  Let's get married. 
  That's the plan. 
  No, I mean, let's do it now. 
  Oh, what, 'cause you suddenly - have time for me? 
  - No. 
  Because why not? 
  Well, you know I could think of a few reasons. 
  I'm serious. 
  You've always wanted to go to Hawaii. 
  We should just do it there. 
  - Really? 
  - Yes. 
  We-we can go tomorrow. 
  We can get on a plane tomorrow, after your show. 
  I'll book the tickets right now. 
  Well, wh well, what about our families? 
  We'll have a big party with them when we get back. 
  Um Come on. 
  This is just for you and me. 
  So we can start our family on our own terms. 
  I love you and-and I really think we should do this. 
  I just want to be your wife. 
  Hmm? 
  Come on, come on. 
  My mom is gonna kill me. 
  Mmm. 
  She'll be fine. 
  I'm gonna book the tickets right now. 
  I'm so excited. 
  I remember when Tina miscarried. 
  Yeah. 
  I was thinking about that. 
  God, it was so painful. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  - Is she okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  She'll be okay. 
  She has to, uh go back and get the D&C. 
  - Oh, no. 
  - Oh, God. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I'm so sorry. 
  Yeah. 
  How are you doing? 
  I'm fine. 
  No, I mean really. 
  How are you doing? 
  I don't know. 
  Listen. 
  Quiara is okay, and that's the most important thing. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Right? 
  Yep. 
  And we're here for you now. 
  Yeah, and if my show gets canceled, I'll be here a lot more. 
  And since I'm homeless, then I'll actually be here more than  
  - I realized a second ago. 
  - Wow. 
  We're doing great. 
  How you doing? 
  I'm I'm good, actually. 
  Milner called this morning. 
  - Really? 
  - Yep. 
  He wants me to spearhead a task force addressing the opioid crisis in the city. 
  So, that feels good. 
  You're handling this all really well. 
  Well, we went out swinging. 
  I gave everything I had to the campaign and I found a way to be myself. 
  What more could anyone ask for? 
  Absolutely. 
  Yeah. 
  That's true. 
  Hey, Finley. 
  Come here. 
  Um, can we get everyone in here? 
  Just for a minute. 
  Just kind of  
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Hey, guys, uh, Alice has something to say. 
  It feels kind of important, so - All right, guys, come on. 
  - Good morning. 
  - Morning. 
  - I, uh, I couldn't sleep last night, and I probably should have, because I've had a f*ck sandwich of a week and I'm exhausted. 
  Um two of my best friends suffered horrible losses last night, and i-it got me thinking. 
  Um You know, none of us know how things are gonna turn out. 
  Maybe the best thing to do is just stay true to who we are. 
  I have worked too hard, and I know it sounds ridiculous, but I set out to change well, I don't know, not change the world, 'cause that's but change a few people's minds about a couple of things. 
  And if we can't use this platform to do that, then I don't think I want to be here. 
  Sometimes we have to take a risk, and-and I say let's make the show we want to make. 
  Well, make the show I want to make. 
  We have to make the show I want to make. 
  So f*ck the viral videos. 
  f*ck the network mandate. 
  Sophie. 
  I want Roxane Gay. 
  You got it, boss. 
  Great. 
  The downside is, uh we might not make it, you know. 
  This might be our last show. 
  And if-if that's the case, I am so sorry I failed you. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  I-I'm not gonna cry because my eyelashes will come off. 
  But thank you for everything. 
  I would not have any of this if it weren't for you. 
  You've all worked so hard. 
  Let's go down swinging. 
  Yeah. 
  I love the enthusiasm. 
  Uh, if I could pipe in for just one second, uh, may-maybe we can find - a-a compromise. 
  - Drew. 
  No more. 
  If you can't get on board, then get the f*ck out of here. 
  So, so you're gonna, uh, get Roxane, um  
  - Roxane  
  - Roxane Gay? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, can I call her that? 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Or ? 
  - I didn't know if that was a joke. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, man. 
  So, I bought tickets to Hawaii today. 
  Sophie's never been. 
  We head out tomorrow. 
  Which island? 
  - Oahu. 
  - Oh. 
  Well, you should go to Maui. 
  No, we're going to Oahu. 
  And we're getting married. 
  Dad, she's going to be my wife. 
  I need you to be okay with that. 
  Well, uh I don't understand why you think she isn't good enough. 
  Our family had to work very hard to get what we have now. 
  She doesn't want your money. 
  It's not about that. 
  It's never been - about that. 
  - Then what? 
  I taught you - to have ambition and pride. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Her family is - Is loving and kind and supportive. 
  I don't want you to take a step backward. 
  - I'm not. 
  - Listen. 
  When you are When you come from a broken family like Sophie, that's the only way you know how to live. 
  She's not from a broken family. 
  She doesn't know stability, and I'm afraid that when things get hard, she's gonna leave you, because that-that's what she knows. 
  Dad, she's so much better than that. 
  She's not gonna leave me. 
  We love each other, and we're good together. 
  I need you to be okay with that. 
  Okay. 
  Tough loss last night. 
  Yeah. 
  It was. 
  What are you going to do next? 
  You know, I'm not sure. 
  Do you want your old job back? 
  No, I don't need a job. 
  You sure? 
  We're moving ahead with our corporate expansion at Lincoln Heights Jail, and there's plenty of room for you. 
  And how is that possible? 
  I negotiated the terms with Milner months ago. 
  So, so you bet against me? 
  No. 
  I don't see it that way. 
  Well, it is pretty f*cked up. 
  Don't talk like that. 
  You know I don't like it. 
  Yes, I do, and that is partly why I do it. 
  - Daniela - And as I adjust to the idea that I can't change you, I invite you to do the same for me. 
  It's gonna be a whole new world for us, Pa. 
  Hey. 
  How you feeling? 
  You want something to eat? 
  What's all this? 
  Oh, that's just some stuff our friends sent over, um I thought you wouldn't want to see it. 
  Why would you think that? 
  I don't know. 
  Um I'm still gonna have a baby, Shane. 
  I'm gonna try again as soon as I'm ready. 
  Yeah um yeah. 
  I f*cking knew it. 
  You knew what? 
  You were relieved. 
  - I lost a baby, and you were relieved. 
  - No, no, no, no, no. 
  I was relieved that you were okay. 
  That's bullshit. 
  What? 
  You win. 
  You get whatever you want. 
  Hold on a second. 
  That's not fair. 
  - None of this is f*cking fair, Shane. 
  - Hey, listen. 
  You knew I didn't want this, but you showed up pregnant anyway. 
  So what was I supposed to do? 
  You could have been honest from the beginning. 
  I was honest with you. 
  Well, then why did you agree to this? 
  Because I love you. 
  And I agreed to do this so I could be with you. 
  Do you want to be with me now? 
  Yeah. 
  So you're saying you would like to try again, too? 
  I'm-I'm saying that, uh I want to be realistic and to and to plan. 
  - That's-that's what I thought. 
  - What? 
  You're never gonna change, Shane. 
  Wait, w-w-w-wait. 
  Hold on. 
  I'm sorry. 
  What is ? 
  No one is ever going to love you because you're incapable of loving anyone but your f*cking self. 
  Remember this? 
  I never got rid of it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I got the door. 
  You know, all of this is just gonna sit in my garage until Yeah, I don't even know what the end of that sentence could possibly be. 
  Well, you never know. 
  Angie might think it's cool one day. 
  Doubtful. 
  So, what's next for you? 
  Uh, Sophie and I are actually going to Hawaii. 
  Yeah, we're gonna go get married out there, just-just us. 
  Congratulations. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, when you come back, I hope you'll consider joining me in the Milner administration. 
  He's asked me to spearhead a task force addressing the opioid crisis. 
  Bette. 
  It's a setup. 
  What do you mean?

  And, um he's been supporting Milner this whole time. 
  His connection to Big Pharma runs deep. 
  Milner's using you. 
  He just wants it to look like he gives a sh1t. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Was it worth it? 
  Was any of it f*cking worth it? 
  Yes. 
  Yes, I think it was. 
  I don't know anymore.

  Just, like, way down  
  - and never talk about it? 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Is that what you're doing? 
  Of course that's what I'm doing.

  This feels too good. 
  This, this is amazing. 
  Are you ready to see yours? 
  Yeah. 
  I feel like the eroticism in my work has never been this overt. 
  It's always been a thread in the conversation I wanted to create, or something. 
  Sorry. 
  I'm talking a lot because I'm very nervous. 
  Don't be. 
  I don't know anything about art, and I am so proud of you.

  I can't be this person for you. 
  I know. 
  I know that. 
  I I just, I'm sorry. 
  You said I was a good person, and I'm so clearly not that. 
  I, like, I think I really hurt her, and it made me sort of, like, realize that I really hurt you, too, and I'm just I am so, so sorry. 
  Um yeah, that's it. 
  I'm gonna f*ck off and get the f*ck out of L. A. 
  Wait.

  And you are a good person. 
  Good people make mistakes. 
  Was it was it a mistake? 
  It doesn't matter. 
  She's getting married, and I might have, like, really f*cked it up for her, - and she does not deserve that. 
  - What about you? 
  What do you deserve? 
  Uh not you. 
  Not her. 
  You guys are both, like, way better than me. 
  See, that? 
  That's shame. 
  You have to a-address that. 
  - How the f*ck do you do that? 
  - I don't know. 
  It's not a cut-and-dry thing. 
  It is a lifelong journey of cultivating self-worth, self-love. 
  Love? 
  I don't even like myself right now, like, at all. 
  And I just need I need something, like, concrete. 
  I need I need some help here. 
  Okay. 
  Anything. 
  It feels really good sometimes to take responsibility for the mistakes that you've made. 
  And you're actually already doing it. 
  - Okay. 
  - Just little things. 
  Just start small. 
  Little baby steps. 
  I got it. 
  Thank you. 
  Um, and I'm sorry for showing up like this. 
  And you are a real priest.

  - Hmm? 
  What's wrong? 
  Mom, what's wrong? 
  I'm just tired. 
  Okay. 
  Do you want coffee? 
  Something to eat? 
  No, I just need to rest. 
  We could watch TV. 
  Not now, sweetheart. 
  I knew that it would hit you eventually. 
  It's okay. 
  You know? 
  To be sad. 
  But maybe you should come with me. 
  Can you get dressed? 
  I'll, I'll get your shoes and I'll meet you at the front door. 
  Okay? 
  Do you recognize this place? 
  Of course. 
  Yeah, we spread some of Auntie Kit's ashes here. 
  I haven't been up here since then. 
  I come up here with Jordi a lot. 
  You do? 
  Well, yeah, sometimes. 
  Just whenever I'm sad about Aunt Kit or Mama T or Are you sad about her getting married? 
  Yeah. 
  I guess a tiny part of me always hoped that you two would get back together. 
  - I know it sounds stupid, but I did - No, no, no, no, it's not it's not stupid. 
  I'm really sorry that that you saw me like that. 
  It's okay. 
  You never let yourself be sad. 
  - What do you mean? 
  - Well, Mom left and then Aunt Kit died, and like, I see you. 
  You just What? 
  You just kept going. 
  I think I think that I felt that if I if I truly let myself grieve, then that would mean saying a final goodbye, and I wasn't ready to do that. 
  I guess I just try to outrun my feelings. 
  Did I ever tell you that I one time I went on a silent retreat? 
  No. 
  How did that go? 
  How do you think it went? 
  - Not good. 
  - No. 
  - No? 
  - No, not well. 
  Not well at all. 
  But, but I did learn, um, one thing that helped. 
  What was that? 
  - Uh - What? 
  Do you want to scream with me? 
  Yeah, scream. 
  I said scream. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah? 
  Okay, but you really have to do it. 
  Like, you have to fully do it for it to work. 
  You-you have to commit to it. 
  - Can you do that? 
  - Yep. 
  Okay. 
  - Ready? 
  - Yeah, I'm ready. 
  One - Two three.

  The doors don't function. 
  You're coming back, right?

  Um I'll catch you on the flip side, bud.

  Rule number one: put yourself out there.

  We got Alice and Roxane Gay coming right at you. 
  Are you and Jordi having s*x? 
  - Mom. 
  - I We literally just started dating. 
  Okay, I know that you don't want to talk to me  
  - about this, but  
  - No, I really don't. 
  I just asked Alice one question. 
  It does not mean that I'm doing anything. 
  Oh, well, look, I'm not gonna tell you that you're too young or you're or you're not ready or  
  - anything like that. 
  - That's good. 
  That's great. 
  Yeah, 'cause that would be pointless. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Right, but I-I will say that s*x is supposed to feel good. 
  - Oh, my God, Mom. 
  Mom. 
  - Yeah, for both of you. 
  - Okay, okay. 
  - Yeah, so - Got it. 
  - And if you're scared or you're feeling pressured, it's just  
  - it's not gonna feel good. 
  - Okay. 
  Okay. 
  Can this be over now? 
  I really don't Uh, sure. 
  I mean, it's the preamble,  
  - but, yeah, sure. 
  - Okay, cool. 
  Oh, my God! 
  Look at that dog. 
  Hi! 
  - Is this your dog? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi, sweetie. 
  - Her name's Lynn. 
  Oh! 
  - My God, Bette. 
  Hey. 
  - Oh! 
  Hey, Maya. 
  Nice to see you out in the real world. 
  You, too. 
  I Look, I know I'm supposed to be impartial, but I was really pulling for you. 
  Oh, well, thank you. 
  Means a lot. 
  Well, have a great hike. 
  Thanks. 
  Um, do you want to grab dinner sometime? 
  Uh, I'm not really doing any press right now,  
  - but thanks. 
  - Oh. 
  No, no, no. 
  I-I meant off the off the clock. 
  Oh, uh - Uh - You know what? 
  Just think about it. 
  - You've got my number. 
  - All right. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  - You, too. 
  All right. 
  Well, she's pretty. 
  - Stop it. 
  Don't. 
  - Just saying, that's - Stop it. 
  - This is exciting! 
  Why is it exciting? 
  - Nothing happened. 
  - You just found - the love of your life. 
  - No, that's not true. 
  I see sparks in the air. 
  And we're back with Roxane Gay. 
  I've always been obsessed with your idea of bad feminism. 
  You know, like, I really identify with that. 
  You know, I hear that from women a lot, and I think it's because, for a lot of us, we have this idea of what a feminist is as angry and man-hating and hairy, which There's nothing wrong with any of that, but, you know, there has to be space in feminism for us to be human and flawed but also to really care about the state of women in the world. 
  Yeah. 
  Thank you. 
  Can you be a bad queer? 
  Oh, absolutely. 
  Historically, in the queer community, we've tried to resist heteronormative ideas. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - And, so, these days, to be a bad queer is probably to want a wife and two kids and a picket fence. 
  I think I might be a bad queer. 
  - Oh, really? 
  How so? 
  - Well, I've been in a relationship with a really wonderful woman - for about two years. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  And we were really happy, and not too long ago, we introduced a third person into our couple. 
  Like, a poly situation? 
  With her ex-wife. 
  Wow. 
  That's certainly an original way of getting into polyamory. 
  I wouldn't recommend it. 
  You think? 
  But that is the queerest thing I could ever do,  
  - right? 
  - Oh, absolutely. 
  On a scale of one to "what the f*ck",  
  - that's way out there. 
  - Right? 
  Right. 
  'Cause I thought I was this cool, open, you know, understanding queer lady who wanted to live outside of every box, and I'm not. 
  I-I'm just, uh I'm heartbroken. 
  Yeah, that's understandable. 
  Because I just want Nat. 
  - You know, just Nat. 
  - I'm here. 
  - What? 
  - Hi. 
  What's happening? 
  Sorry. 
  Um, I'm here. 
  It's Excuse me. 
  It's me. 
  Uh Um - Can we cut? 
  - Yeah, of course. 
  - This, this isn't the show, so  
  - No. 
  Keep rolling. 
  We need this. 
  I was gonna wait for you in your office, but then I heard what you were saying, and I just I-I'm in the middle of a show. 
  Sorry. 
  Um, can I  
  - Can I go up there? 
  - No. 
  - Yeah? 
  Okay. 
  - No. 
  - No. 
  - All right. 
  - Oh, okay? 
  - Absolutely. 
  Yes. 
  I don't know. 
  I just Hi. 
  Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  I'm a huge fan. 
  - Hi. 
  - Sorry. 
  Just - Thank you. 
  - No, go ahead. 
  - I didn't Okay. 
  - Um - What's happening? 
  Oh. 
  No. 
  No, I'm not proposing. 
  I'm just trying to get closer to her. 
  Yeah, I don't do marriage. 
  Okay. 
  I want you, too. 
  I lost a marriage because I was afraid to fight for what I wanted, and I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice. 
  I love you. 
  I am in love with you. 
  And I feel like my complete and total self when I'm with you. 
  And you make me laugh. 
  Even when I'm mad, which is so f*cking annoying. 
  But it makes me love you even more. 
  And your maternal instincts are a little off, but  
  - Well, I'm-I'm  
  - Well, I know. 
  And you wake up every morning and you burn the sh1t out of their eggs, and I love that. 
  They're deceivingly hard to make. 
  Not really. 
  They're very easy. 
  Love, you tried to make it work with my ex-wife because you thought it would make me happy. 
  - I did. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I really did that. 
  - I know. 
  I mean, she's the f*cking best. 
  - I'm pretty great. 
  - Yeah, you are. 
  I love you. 
  I'm gonna fight for you. 
  Okay? 
  Just me? 
  Yes. 
  Just you. 
  Micah, please open the door. 
  Micah, I'm sorry. 
  It's not what you think. 
  I just want to talk to you. 
  Please open the door.
