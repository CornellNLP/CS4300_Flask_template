Listen, I know I said I wasn't gonna come back, and yet, here's Danny, right? I am so sorry, everyone. Oh, Steve has my gun. [Dramatic music plays] Danny. Really good to see you, Steve. How are things? ♪ ♪ Please don't shoot me. People of the island, before us swings a traitor. Any last words? Owen was right about you. You're a monster. You're a piece of sh1t! There are two types of people in this world... People who are good, and... You know what? Forget it. Last-word privileges revoked. This is bullshit! Guys, we don't have to take this from him. We can fight back. Danny's right! Steve should go in the pit. Careful, Jess. You shot Todd. You shoot someone, you go into the pit. Those were your rules, Steve. Grab him! S-Seriously, guys? No one?

I mean, we can't be too careful these days. It's fine. We're all just guarding the pit. Yeah. Who would even be watching us? Owen : What happened here? I swear to God, I'm gonna throttle that ginger. [Grunts] Oh, God! Oh, my abs. [Groans] You guys, I just saw the pit! He's got like a dozen people down there. He's lost his goddamn mind. Is Danny in there? And Jess? This is so messed up. So what are we gonna do? We need to make these people see the reality of the situation, okay? This is our home now. And why would we want to go back anyway, right? I mean, Karen, you're Vice President of the island! I would die for you, Steve. That's what I'm talking about! And, Pack, you certainly can't go back. You know, 'cause... Block your ears, Karen. You ate a guy! Hey, I know Steve! Come on, you don't have to say it out loud! So what? She can't hear me. Look, watch this. Karen. Karen. Karen. Karen! Karen. Karen! Karen. Huh. See? All I'm saying is if you go back home, you're gonna be treated like a freak. I can't go back. Exactly! Thank you! Guys, we need to make sure these people realize the truth. We're here for good.

You're not going anywhere unless Steve says. Roger, the boat is right out there, okay?! Don't you want to go home on that boat?! Look at me. Look at my face! I can't go back to the real world looking like this. Come on, man. Your face... Your face is fine. It doesn't look like... Like sausage. Don't push me. I killed a man outside Tallahassee. I'll do it again. [Florence grunts] [Groans] Oh, God! Oh, what the sh1t? [Cheering] Okay. We got to get you guys the hell out of here. Come on! Hey, Pack. Get back! Whoa! Hey.

 Owen : Don't you want to get rescued, huh? Owen, I've done things... Unspeakable things. I'm a monster! [Laughing] Yeah, you are! Hey, buddy, listen to me. Whatever you did, it can't be that bad. I ate a dude! Holy sh... wow! Okay, that's a lot to process. I got to think about that for a second. [Exhales sharply] How'd you kill him? I didn't kill him. He was already dead. I was starving. Okay, well, that's, you know... It's whatever. "Whatever"? Pack, it's gross that you ate someone, but, um... you're not a monster. Really? Mm-hmm. It's totally normal. So, people won't think I'm insane like... like Steve said? I don't think so. In fact, I think that people like when other people do crazy sh1t to survive, you know? I think they'll probably make a movie about you. Right? Like, "127 Hours"... "Alive," you know? "The Revenant." Who would play me? [Sighs] Really? Um... Don Cheadle. I love Don Don Cheadle. Yeah. He's got so much range. I know. Give me the gun. No. ♪ ♪ Get out of here. What are you doing?! Pack, you can't go home! And Don Cheadle? You think the Chead is gonna waste his talent on you?!

[Sobs] Okay, well, thanks so much for the, uh, yeah. [Music continues] Jerry : No! I'm gonna get rescued, and I'm gonna go back! No! And they're gonna write a book about me, and it's gonna be a bestseller. Someone's gonna ghostwrite the sh1t out of that book! No! [Groans] And Don Cheadle's gonna do the movie 'cause the money's right, and he's gonna win an Oscar. If you think Don Cheadle's gonna play you, you are living in the house of lies! You're done! No! [Sobs] You're not even a fun ghost! You suck, you ghost piece of sh1t. Ow!! Why fire?! Why fire?! Why couldn't you just let me fade away like "Field of Dreams"?

[Cheering] It's over, Steve. Once I fire this, we're saved. Oh, God! Ahh! Hey, hey, hey, hey! You shoot the flare gun, and I'll blow his giant head off. Hey, hey! Let's... Let's relax, Steve. You relax, Steve! I'm already relaxed! I'm very relaxed! I'm on a holiday, goddamn it! Well, well, well. Looky what we have here... The Powerpuff Girl and her crunchy boy-toy.

Also... this boar-snatching bee-otch is about to get a big, old, fat knuckle sandwich, courtesy of "Streaks." Whoo! Finally! I was beginning to think this was a dickless island. Oh, no, honey. This island's got some wee-wee, all right. Yeah! Todd, your stomach! Six-pack. I'm fine. Ugh. You look like sh1t. So why don't we make this interesting, huh? Whoa. Wow. Holy moly. A fair fight, mano a mano. You're not gonna distract me with your surprisingly supple breasts. Why don't you take a photo? It'll last longer! [Screams] [Groans] Put a shirt on, weirdo!

Do it for your lover. Owen, it's okay. Fire it, man. If he kills me, so be it. I'll do it! ♪ ♪ I've already killed Turdhole today. Don't make me kill again. Owen, just shoot it. No, Danny, I can't just... Owen, it's okay. Get off the island. Don't let him hold us hostage. ♪ ♪ "Always shoot your hostage?" Always shoot the hostage. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
