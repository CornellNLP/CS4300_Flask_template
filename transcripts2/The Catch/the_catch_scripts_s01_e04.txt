 If you can't love somebody at their worst, then you never really loved them. 
 You're not in a relationship, are you? 
 Are you? 
 In a relationship? 
 Our benefactor is expecting payment. 
 If we don't pay... 
 Ben : I will make enough off the Princess to cover all our debt and then some. 
 Who are you? 
 Michael Thorne. 
 Alice : So he's officially Michael Thorne? 
 He just opened three new credit cards. 
 We'll know where he is and what he's doing. 
 Margot : The mark is Qasim Halabi, the princess' guardian. 
 I will find out who you really are. 
 I will expose you. 
 [Grunts] 
 He's a killer. 
 And you'll never catch him on your own. 
 We were together for over a year. 
 And you're saying that, in all that time, she never saw the real you? 
 If you're thinking about her, I guarantee she's thinking about you. 
 Listen, I know you're angry, and you have every right to be. 
 Promise me you won't come looking for me. 
 Alice : I won't come looking for you. 
 Because I've already found you.

 Within the week, he says.

 Women can work here. They can go to school. 
 They can go see a doctor without asking for a man's permission.

 Take as much money as you can and disappear.

 In January 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake crippled the city of Léogâne in Haiti.

 160,000 people lost their lives that day because first responders couldn't find them in time.

 This is Gwen Ericsson, who, along with Marie Sherwood here, designed our THRUsight technology. 
 As you can see, Gwen is.... extraordinary young woman. 
 She's a genius. 
 She's a beloved member of our corporate family, and she is currently missing. 
 She left our offices Friday night and has not been seen or heard from since. 
 Has anyone been to her apartment? 
 I have. 
 She hasn't been there in days. 
 You've talked to her friends, family? 
 Everyone. 
 No ones heard from her... no calls, texts, e-mails. 
 We've tried to locate her cellphone, her laptop. 
 Did you contact the police? 
 If it was any other project, we would have, but this is THRUsight. 
 And THRUsight is the reason we signed the NDA. 
 Marie. 
 [Keyboard clacks] 
 THRUsight was designed to help located disaster victims behind walls, floors, under rubble, debris. 
 Valerie : It sees through walls? 
 Marie : Drywall, cement blocks, concrete. 
 Human flesh. 
 We can monitor your heartbeat from 30 miles away. 
 It can also target and detect troops, armaments... pretty much anything. 
 So it's a weapon. 
 It was not designed to be, but... 
 Potentially. 
 I can't believe this exists. 
 Well, we're still a few weeks away from production, but the only person that has a complete copy of the manufacturing specs... 
 Alice : Is Gwen. 
 Valerie : And now she's missing. 
 Or she's been taken. 
 Along with her laptop. 
 Taken by... 
 Any of our competitors, rival nation, terrorist group. 
 You can see why it's essential that we find her.

 Um... 
 The thing Phillip didn't tell you is sometimes Gwen does this. 
 She disappears? 
 When she can't figure something out or doesn't know the answer to something, she'll grab her laptop and go on a hike or to the beach, and I didn't tell Phillip because I thought she'd just show up [Voice breaking] like she always does. 
 But it's been four days. 
 I should've said something to Phillip. 
 I just thought Gwen was being Gwen. 
 Now, if anything's happened to her... 
 Don't worry, Marie. We're gonna find her. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 Ben : She wants me to help her disappear. 
 How much money have you already taken? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Well, you're her financial advisor. 
 I assume you've been skimming off the top. 
 That is what Qasim was doing. 
 And rightly so. 
 You're making me wish I hadn't shot him. 
 I am earning her trust. 
 You've earned her trust. Now rob her blind.

 Well, in which case, I'd like to explain. 
 Let me be clear. 
 I'm not the messenger. 
 I'm the collector. 
 I know exactly what you are. 
 I know who you are, as well. 
 You still have quite the reputation back home. 
 In fact, you've made it very difficult for anyone else in this position to measure up. 
 Have I? 
 How much have you got? 
 $1.5 million.

 We're not giving you anything.

 Why do you insist on giving away all our money? 
 Did you not see the gun she left out in full view for maximum impact? 
 You're going to have to tell the princess that you found a fleet of private jets for her to invest in or a château in San Simeon. 
 She doesn't want any of that. She feels trapped by it all. 
 And at the moment, I know how she feels. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Then sell her that. 
 Sell her what? 
 Freedom. 
 How does her writing me a check for $10 million... 
 $15 million just while we're about it. 
 Well, how does that buy her freedom?

 They'll disown me. 
 That's the idea.

 You'll be granted asylum.

 When Gwen Ericsson was in high school, she invented a device that uses sound to determine the location of explosives. 
 In 2010, after the Haiti earthquake, Gwen returned to the U.S. to develop THRUsight to help first responders locate survivors. 
 But she didn't have any money, so... 
 She partnered with Marie Sherwood, her best friend and roommate. 
 Marie was finishing her MBA at Stanford when she and Gwen launched Pegasys, a tiny startup that caught the eye of Phillip Thompson. 
 So while Gwen was busy engineering THRUsight... 
 Marie was busy engineering the sale of Pegasys to Olympic Edge, giving Gwen all the money and resources she needed to get THRUsight off her laptop and into production. 
 Until the night she disappeared. 
 And according to Phillip Thompson, Gwen never missed a deadline. 
 So we're thinking kidnapping by a rival company. 
 I have a list of possible candidates. 
 Or a dictatorship or a terrorist cell. 
 I'm looking into some of the darker corners of the Internet. 
 Any luck tracking the laptop? 
 Not yet. 
 But we do have a lead on Gwen's car. 
 Sophie was able to hack in to her FasTrak account, and on Saturday morning, she took Exit 76 off of 210. 
 What's Exit 76? 
 The San Alvarez hiking trails. 
 Call Marie. Find out if Gwen had a favorite trail there. 
 Lamplight Peak. We're headed there now. 
 Oh, and, Danny, take Shawn with you. 
 What? Why? 
 If we're dealing with terrorists... 
 I can handle terrorists. 
 Oh, he's... Just... 
 He's bigger than you are. To be safe. 
 Danny : There it is. That's Gwen's car. 
 Sophie : Looks like it's been there awhile. 
 Shawn : Maybe we'll get lucky and the laptop will be here, too? 
 I wouldn't count on it. 
 You might want to let me go first.

 Listen to me. Please. 
 You can't give THRUsight back to Phillip Thompson.

 How do you know? 
 When Marie and I first sold THRUsight to Phillip, it was on the condition he tell us every client he sold it to. 
 And he withheld that information? 
 Not officially. 
 As got closer to the launch, I started trolling black market sites for anything that looked like THRUsight, and I found a listing on a Tor site dedicated to illicit weapons sales. 
 If that's true, why not go to the authorities? 
 Because a weapon is a weapon no matter who has it.
