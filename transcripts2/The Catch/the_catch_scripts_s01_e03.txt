 Previously on "The Catch"... 
 So, if I were the right guy, you would marry me. 
 Would you? Marry me. 
 Did you just ask me to marry you? 
 [Laughing] 
 Ben : You've reached Christopher Hall. Please leave a message. 
 Christopher is gone. 
 The man I've been chasing for two years was your fiancé. 
 "Christopher Ryan Hall dies at 75." 
 The same week you met your Christopher Ryan Hall. 
 Both obits published in the New York Tribune. 
 Val? Gordon for you. 
 Tell him I will see him in divorce court. 
 Actually, tell him I'll see him in Hell. 
 There's a grieving Kuroqi princess who recently lost her father. 
 Well, what's the con? 
 The mark is Qasim Halabi, the princess's guardian. 
 I get to Qasim, we get the money. 
 I have to admit, I was jealous of Alice Vaughan. 
 I thought she'd ruined you. 
 Reggie, I love Margot. I would do anything for her. 
 You guys are my family. You know that. 
 But I am in love with Alice Vaughan. 
 You're on drugs. I'm gonna be your sponsor. 
 I want to keep you sober, and I want to keep Alice alive. 
 Coroner's report on Michael Thorne. 
 I'll put an obit in the Trib. 
 He'll use Michael Thorne's social security number to open up a credit card, and then we'll have him. 
 I am Princess Zara Al-Salim. 
 Who are you? 
 My name is Thorne. Michael Thorne. 
 I... lied to her about who I really was. 
 Zara : We all do that... in the beginning. 
 Well, we were together for over a year. 
 Lived together nine months. 
 And you're saying that, in all that time, she never saw the real you? 
 You're an idiot. 
 [Chuckles] Why is that? 
 Because you're sitting here with me and not her. 
 I'd give anything to find someone like that. 
 Well, what's stopping you? 
 You're beautiful, rich, royalty... 
 Which means my life is not my own. 
 I'm essentially their prisoner. 
 You don't have that excuse. 
 You'd be surprised. 
 [Scoffs] How are you a prisoner? 
 You know what? It's late. 
 Let's go. 
 No, one more drink. 
 Waiter? 
 It's just one more drink, Qasim. 
 Are you threatening to tattle on me? 
 No, Princess, but it's late. 
 I'm sorry. I'm confused. Who works for whom here? 
 [Chuckles] 
 My job, Mr. Thorne, is to protect the Princess from those who would take advantage. 
 Zara : Mr. Thorne has his own fortune. 
 He has no need of mine. 
 Two more, please. 
 On me. 
 So as not to take advantage. 
 That'll be all, Qasim. 
 Yes, Princess.

 He just opened three new credit cards.

 Alice : Thank you, Sophie. 
 Now go home and get some sleep. 
 We've got a big day tomorrow. 
 We are gonna catch Michael Thorne.

 This is Agent Dao. 
 I need you to run a name for me, please. 
 I need all bank and credit card activity for a man named Michael Thorne. 
 Do you see what's happening out here? 
 Does Val know? 
 I told her. 
 What'd she say? 
 That I should have Agent Shawn forcibly remove him from the premises. 
 Tell Agent Shawn to stand down. 
 Hi, Gordon. 
 Hi, Allie. [Chuckles] 
 You can't be here. She doesn't want to see you. 
 I know. I'm sorry.

 It's work. 
 We need your help. 
 He says it's a class-action lawsuit. 
 Of course he does. 
 Against Big Pharma. 
 That's a big fat lie. 
 He's trying to avoid having to deal with my lawyer, who's an even better lawyer than he is. 
 Val, Gordon's client just got here. 
 It's... 
 What? Who is it? 
 It's your sister-in-law. 
 Look, whatever's going on here, whatever emotionally coercive sneak attack you two have planned...

 Valerie : So, how long have you known? 
 I was diagnosed right after I got the new job. 
 Sooz... I didn't tell anyone.

 And you didn't tell me? 
 It wasn't my news to share, and you stopped taking my calls. 
 Why is that, I wonder? 
 Guys, class-action lawsuit? 
 Right. So... 
 M.S. interrupts the communication between the brain and the body. 
 I try to walk, but I stagger. 
 I go to pick up a glass, I knock it over. 
 It's like I'm drunk, but I'm not, so it's not nearly as much fun. 
 Now, some types of M.S. respond to medication... 
 Mine, of course, does not. But three months ago, a pharmaceutical company called MedGenix announced a clinical trial for people like Susan.

 Which resulted in me and 16 other people being taken to the ICU. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What happened? 
 I couldn't walk. I couldn't see. 
 People were collapsing, driving off the road. 
 One went into a coma. 
 I was paralyzed and blind for a week. 
 And MedGenix refuses to accept any responsibility for it. 
 Because you signed a waiver. 
 Which I signed because they lied. 
 They said there were no adverse reactions in the previous trial. 
 So you want us to prove they were lying. 
 Look, I know this is not a good time for you guys, with the divorce and everything, so I completely understand if you can't... 
 Sooz, you are my sister.

 I will find out who you really are, "Mr. Thorne." 
 And when I do, I will expose you, and I will make all the necessary arrangements to ensure the safety of the Princess. 
 So you may want to disappear... before I see to that myself.

 Uh, they didn't actually meet in court. 
 Alice : No, Val was working for opposing counsel. 
 Mm-hmm.

 So of course you had to hire her. 
 I couldn't afford to go up against her in court again. 
 Plus, you thought she was hot.

 Why didn't you just ask her out? 
 She's got a wooden leg, man.

 I mean, call me shallow, but, no, look at her. 
 She's out of my league. 
 Oh, stop it. 
 I can't believe you all met at work. 
 I'm clearly in the wrong business. 
 What do you do? 
 Susan was a V.P. at Nationside. 
 And she's got an interview next week with Edgewick Capital. 
 Oh. I know Larry Sauls.

 MedGenix made $2.5 billion last year on their M.S. drug, but it loses its patent protection next year, which is why they're testing Celinex. 
 Celinex was developed by Dr. Richard Watkins at CAL-SCI for his wife. 
 She has the same type of M.S. Susan has. 
 But Celinex wasn't expected to go into clinical trials until next year. 
 So the drug's not even finished yet. 
 That's why it's poisoning people? 
 But if that's true, the patients in the first clinical trial would've had the same symptoms. 
 So where are they? 
 Well, they're not in the published data. 
 So we need to get our hands on Dr. Watkins' raw data, see if it matches, and if it doesn't... 
 We've got him. 
 I think I know where we can get it. 
 From MedGenix? 
 From Dr. Watkins. 
 Watkins : 20 years ago, there were no approved therapies for multiple sclerosis. 
 But today, I'm able to discuss a number of exciting... 
 So, what's the plan? 
 You distract him after this with your... feminine wiles while I sneak into his office and steal his laptop? 
 Oh, sure. If this doesn't work. 
 You're hacking his laptop? 
 He was asking for it. 
 His password is his wife's name and birthday. 
 Ugh. People and their wives. 
 [Sighs] 
 So what did Val's husband do to make her want to divorce him? 
 I'm not really one to gossip. 
 He cheated... one time... and then he felt so bad about it that he went and told Val, and she still won't forgive him. 
 Wait. He's the victim in this story? 
 I'm just saying... 
 Shh! 
 Along with the regulatory role of dormant B-cells... 
 I'm just saying that if you can't love somebody at their worst, then you never really loved them. 
 You're not in a relationship, are you? 
 I don't know if I believe in them. 
 Why? Are you? 
 In a relationship?
