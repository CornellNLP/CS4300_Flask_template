 Previously on "The Catch"... 
 I'm sorry, but we can't do this. It's not good for me. Is the Christopher thing taking over? A little. Call my therapist. You are trying to make this a thing, and this ain't a thing. This was rebound s*x. How does one man outsmart us? I think he's part of something bigger. They're called the Kensington Firm. They've been operating out of London since the '50s. Rhys : You are now looking at the proud new co-owner of every Weatherby hotel in the country. The Kensington Firm is now expanded into North America But the U.S. is my territory. Was your territory. Alice Vaughan is the one who cost you America and Benji. Tell me about the Kensington Firm. What are you doing? You're on their side, you're going down with them. Pick a side. Until you do, we're done. I got a referral from your therapist. Jessica Philips, MFT. Don't hold anything back. I could use some help. Tell me everything. She was his mark. He was pretending to be in love with her for a year so that we could get close to her clients. I guess he wasn't pretending. I am sorry, sis. No, you're not. You're just trying to distract me so I won't hit you back. Oh, please. You've got no capital. You've got no infrastructure... and now you've got no Benji. All right, enough. Get out. All right, look. Alice Vaughan is a problem for both of us. If he's told her about you, he's told her about me and the firm. We have to deal with her. You want to kill her? Be my guest. See if your precious Benji comes back to you then. Or were you hoping that I would do it and then he'd hate me and not you? [Sighs] Are you gonna tell him? He'd only warn her. I have to find out what she knows. I've done some online reconnaissance and found that Alice Vaughan has her very first therapy appointment this week. So, I'll pay a visit to her therapist. I'll make her a very persuasive offer. And then, when Alice arrives... Alice Vaughan? Jessie Phillips. Please come in. ♪ ♪ So, the man you were supposed to marry stole everything from you and then disappeared? Until... I found him again. And how did that happen? I, um... started working with the FBI to find him. And when I finally did... he told me it was real... that what we had was real. And I know he can't be trusted, but... Have you seen him since? I haven't told anyone. Are you sleeping with him? He wants me to run away with him. And that's why I'm here. Because part of me really wants to do it. Well, don't worry. I won't let you. ♪ ♪ I know... you said no more showing up unannounced. Yeah, and I meant it. But you also said not to call, so... Are you here to help me take down the Kensington Firm? No. Then you can't be here. I am here to show you why you can't take down the Kensington Firm. Drugs, arson, arms trading, murder. ♪ ♪ These are the people you're loyal to? These are the people who own me. These are the people with whom I got into business before I knew any better. And now that I do... I am afraid for you. Thank you. These will be very helpful. Allie, I couldn't be more... Look, I believe you. Which is why I had Agent Shawn give me this, which I promise I will not hesitate to use on anyone who threatens me or comes into my house uninvited. Please, don't do this. If you're not gonna help me, you have to go. ♪ ♪ Rhys : Why are you so determined to get me out of Los Angeles all of a sudden? I mean, are you tired of me? [Chuckles] Am I that terrible? No, I'm just saying I'm happy to look after your interests here if you'd prefer to go back home to London. Wait, so... you'd be willing to come back to the firm? [Sighs] I would. How does my sister feel about this? Is she part of the package? Well, I haven't discussed it with her yet, but I was thinking why not have Margot take over the East Coast operations for the firm? Ah. [Laughs] I see... you want to get me out of town. You want to get her out so you can spend more nights with... what was her name? You never said. We're not seeing each other anymore. Oh, you all right? Maybe I should stick around... you know, cheer you up a bit, get Bad Benji back out to play. I think I'll be all right. What do you say? Do we have a deal? Well... let's ask Margot first. And then, if you're still alive, you tell me whether we have a deal. ♪ ♪ [Camera shutter clicking] [Beeping] Alice, Kelsey's here. Okay. So, how do you guys know each other? Me and Sophie? I was a total fangirl. Of...? Sophie's. Do they not know? She's a ridiculous singer. What? Okay. We used to be in a band together. You were in a band? There are videos I will show you. Okay, you're putting that away. Why? But they're adorable. It was a long time ago. There was a ukulele involved, and that's all I'll say. What was the name of the band? May I walk you to the conference room? I should never have signed the contract. Sophie told me not to. I didn't tell you not to. I just said you're basically signing your life away and making no money. It's a standard major-label recording contract. So, why sign with a major label? Because they spend millions promoting the record. And because they hooked me up with Nathan Ashmore. Nathan Ashmore? The songwriter-producer. He's a pop genius. He's a one-man Beatles, a one-man ABBA. Did you just put ABBA on the same level as the Beatles? He writes nothing but hits. And he saved my life. My boyfriend and I were broke. We had nowhere to live, and he moved us into his studio, paid for everything, and we recorded an awesome album together. So, then why do you want out of your contract? Because PMG won't release it. PMG is... The Panoply Music Group. Kelsey has a seven-album deal with Nathan, but Nathan's deal is with PMG. And I can't spend the rest of my life making albums with Nathan that PMG won't put out. Did they say why they won't release it? No, they won't even tell Nathan. So, let us find out for you. You would do that? For a friend of Sophie's? Absolutely. [Knock on door] Margot? [Door closes] [Keyboard clacking] Are you all right? I've been calling. 'Cause you're worried about me? You talked to Rhys, didn't you? Look, I know you're upset, but the firm has resources we don't have... that we'll never have. So, why not team up with them again? What? Just hear me out. He'd go back to London. You'd take over the East Coast. I'd run the West. And we'd all get together for Christmas? Have you lost your mind? What's the alternative? We have nothing. We're starting from nothing. And whose fault is that? Who let Alice Vaughan take everything from us? And now you want to go running off to work for my idiot brother so that you can stay in Los Angeles while I, what, disappear off to New York? Tell me why. Tell me why you want me gone. What do you want? I want you gone. You and my brother deserve each other. You're not getting rid of me that easily. [Door closes] ♪ ♪ So, just to be clear, you're choosing me over Margot? This is massive, Benji. You're really back... for good? And there's no leaving this time. For good. You'-re back in with Rhys? Not as my partner. You're my partner. I'm not working for Rhys. He doesn't even know my name. He knows your name. He just playfully chooses not to use it. Which is why I choose not to work for him. And you're not gonna have to because he is going back to London. Oh, thank you, Lord! And you and I will be running the firm's L.A. office on our terms. We'll never have to see him. Rarely have to see him. What does Margot think about it? Rhys is going to offer her New York. Hopefully she'll take it. Wow. So, that's what this is. Rhys leaves, Margot leaves so you can play house with Little Red. Tell me I'm wrong. The truth is Alice and Agent Dao decided to go after Rhys. What? She thinks if she can put him away, then I have... Does she want to die? Which is why I will do whatever it takes to keep him away from her, even if it means rejoining the firm... for now. For now. Ben, you know how these people are. You want to mortgage the rest of your life for this woman? That's what she's doing for me. This is Rhys Spencer Griffiths. He's a person of interest in Interpol's ongoing investigation of the Kensington Firm. He arrived in Los Angeles 10 days ago. What do we know about him? The heir to a textile fortune. He runs a massive import/export business. Which would make a perfect front for the Kensington Firm. You never looked into this guy? I wasn't investigating the Kensington Firm. I was investigating Christopher Hall for theft, fraud... And the murder of Nathalie Duchamp. I checked Rhys' passport. He was in Paris the day she was killed. And you told Val that the ballistics on the bullets that killed Mickey Shive were the same as those that killed Nathalie. I know you don't want to believe it was Christopher... If Christopher was a murderer, I would be dead right now. Mickey Shive was killed the day after Rhys got here. Do we know if Rhys is still here? No. I can't find any credit cards... personal or corporate. There's no phone. I called his office in London, but he's out of the country. I'll see what I can find out. Thank you. Thank you for this. Mm-hmm. Thank you, Ms. Anderson. What was that? What? Are you and Dao... No. Oh, my God, no. That's too bad. I think he likes you. [Both laugh] ♪ I want ♪

♪ I want... ♪ That's Kelsey and her boyfriend, Tyler. This is the video that got over 3 million views and caught the attention of Nathan Ashmore, hit maker, one-man ABBA, and owner of Kelsey's label, Ashmore Records. You've seen Kelsey's contract with Ashmore. Yeah, it's standard, iron-clad... no way out. Unless we can prove that Nathan or PMG haven't been holding up their side. And what would that look like? Withholding royalties, corporate or financial malfeasance. Is there any sign of malfeasance? Please stop saying "malfeasance." It's all above-board. Everything was going great until PMG refused to release the record. And we still don't know why? Actually, I may have disguised myself as a radio promoter and chatted up two very attractive women at PMG. What?! When?! PMG said they never got Kelsey's record. Nathan never sent over the masters. That's impossible. They said Nathan's still working on one last recording. That's not true. The album's finished. I've heard it. Unless Nathan's lying. How do we find out? We could send someone in undercover. I am talking about a young detective... one who also, apparently, is a very talented singer. Nathan : As I'm sure Kelsey's already told you, we have artists here from New York, Nashville, London. They'll stay a week, a month. Kelsey and Tyler have been here for two years. Everyone works together and writes together. It's like a year-round writing camp. Or an assembly line. Well, it's both, actually. We generate a lot of material very quickly here. It's not for everyone, but... would that be something you'd be interested in? Come on. You've seen the videos. Tell her how great she is. Well, actually, she won't let me see any of them. Do you have them on your laptop? Those videos are ancient, but I could send you some work tapes. So, can I ask, where did you find those lyrics to "Blue Moon"? Well, that song had like four different versions before it was "Blue Moon." But then there's this mysterious intro verse... From the Greta Keller version. [Laughing] How do you know Greta Keller? Who is Greta Keller? Oh, man. Greta Keller was a kind of proto-Marlene Dietrich, you know, musically. Wow, I thought you were just a pop guy. I am. Rodgers and Hart is pop. It doesn't get much better than that. Margot : So, after he left you, after he took your money and disappeared, when was the next time that you saw him? The next day. I knew he'd try to steal the device from a client of mine, so I rigged it to take back the money he had stolen. We just got conned. How? I have no idea. And did you speak to him? No. He called me. But we didn't talk face-to-face until... Paige Baker, I'd like for you to meet... Michael Thorne. I was wearing a wire, hoping to get a confession. And what did he tell you? And I love you. Nothing else matters. That he loves me. And then he returned the money he'd stolen from a Kuroqi princess. Margot : I don't suppose she gave you a check. She did. But her brother froze the account? So, um, has he reformed? No. He stole a diamond bracelet, which then I stole back from him. You stole? I'm doing things that I shouldn't. I'm lying to everyone in my life. The fact is... Ben is a criminal. I need to put him away. Him and the people he works with. ♪ ♪ Benji. What's he doing here? You called. You said you had a job for us. Yeah, us... me and you. Rhys, Reggie's my partner. This is a two-man job. So, let us do the job, and you can go back to London. Wait... you said he was going back to London, right? He's talking. Why is he talking? What's the job? [Sighs] I've gone to a great deal of expense and trouble to have a package delivered to the hotel. We're going to steal it. We're gonna steal a package you're having delivered to the hotel? Now he's just repeating what I'm saying. Why is he doing that? What is this package? Cash? I.P.? Drugs? Guns? What? The package is an investment which will yield unlimited returns. It's like talking to the Riddler. Rhys, what is the package? It's not "what." It's "who." We're going to steal her. ♪ ♪ So, maybe it's different in England, but that was a person, not a package. Yeah, well, "package" was code, and stealing is stealing. Except when you steal a person. That is called abduction. And we're not kidnappers. How do you know unless you've tried? Rhys, who is the woman? She's a very important artist. Her name is Leah Wells. Why is she in handcuffs? And why the U.S. Marshals? Because the American justice system doesn't appreciate fine art. She's a counterfeiter. She's an artist. She's the best in the business. And the reason she's at the Weatherby is because she's made a deal with the feds to testify against her old boss, Jordan Hamlin. Reggie : She's rolling on the head of the Hamlin clan? So not only do we have to get her away from the Feds, we have to do it before the Hamlins try to kill her. Or kill us. That's the plan. Any objections? That plan is gonna get us all killed. The plan is to call Margot and beg her to come up with a plan. It's gonna land us in prison. We need some time to research and recon. Clearly, professionalism... that is a recessive gene in your family. We can't just improvise this sort of thing. Excellent. You have to have some finesse. Well, that's settled, then. Jules : West Umberland Incorporated. That's Rhys Griffiths' shell company. I traced his credit cards. He's staying at the Weatherby Hotel. You couldn't have called to tell us that? Then I wouldn't have been able to see you. [Sighs] Have lunch with me. No. I told you... Having lunch doesn't make it a thing. Having dinner makes it a thing. Or we could just go back to having meaningless s*x. I'm fine with that. Allie. Agent Dao found Rhys Griffiths. At the Weatherby Hotel. At the Weatherby? That's where we found Princess Zara. Can't be a coincidence. I have agents at the hotel. One misstep, and we'll bring him in. I'll, uh, let you two... No, that's it. We're done. That's all I came to say. [Clears throat] I'm not even looking at you right now. Not even looking. [Chuckles] What? What happened? Nothing on Nathan's hard drive? There were e-mails. And contracts. Nathan's contract with PMG? Nathan's contract with Insindiary Entertainment. They're a p0rn company. They specialize in celebrity s*x tapes. Nathan told PMG he was still working on a final recording with Kelsey. I think we know what it is. You filmed me having s*x?! Sophie : Kelsey, let's get you out of here. Uh, hey, guys can we have the room, please? You put a camera in my room... in all our rooms... and you sold the footage. Yes, I did. Kelsey, come on. And all the profits will go to recouping the cost of your record. Kelsey, I'm trying to help you. You've helped enough, Mr. Ashmore. We made a great record, but it's not enough anymore, Kels. You need some kind of a story, and the minute that TMZ shows clips from that tape, I promise you, you will be the biggest artist in the world. For about 10 seconds. It only takes one, pal. They're gonna click on that link, watch the footage, hear the record, and they're gonna love it because it's great, because you're great. But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention. And this is how you get the world's attention. My parents are gonna see that tape. Tyler's parents... No, they won't. We'll stop the release. [Sighs] You can't. I'm sorry. I just sent the link to TMZ. The record will be out and number one on iTunes by midnight. I promise you. We'll file an injunction. We'll sue. You can, and it'll keep the story alive. It'll be great publicity, but you won't win. Tyler and Kelsey signed contracts. This is my studio. And everything that happens in it belongs to me. I promise you, Kels, at this time tomorrow, you will be thanking me. ♪ ♪ 
 
 Rhys : Our counterfeiter, Leah Wells, literally made money for Jordan Hamlin for years. But did he appreciate her? Did he make her feel loved? I'm guessing... He did not. In fact, he sold her out to the Feds, who then made a deal with Leah to testify against Hamlin. So we're gonna make her a better deal. We're gonna make her feel loved. How? She's got round-the-clock U.S. Marshals on her to make sure that Hamlin's team doesn't try and kill her. We're not getting anywhere near Leah Wells. You're not. Benji is as Assistant U.S. Attorney Terrence Davenport. At 5:30 p.m., Benji, as Davenport, will arrive outside Suite 638. I'm here to see the witness. [Beep] He'll then request a little privacy with our favorite state's witness, and then you'll offer her the following. I can get you out of here. You just have to do exactly as I say. First of all, she must demand a transfer to a different hotel because she's convinced there are criminals here. Which, of course, there are. During the transfer, my associates and I will intercept you. We'll protect you from Hamlin's thugs, and we are prepared to offer you a very generous salary for your continued services. Oh, thank God. You have no idea. All I need is your signature on this transfer request. You have no idea how screwed you are. Excuse me? I could scream right now and have you arrested. In fact, it will probably better my Witness Protection deal. You know where they're hiding me? Iowa. Oh. I give them you, and I get the beach house in Charleston. You know who they give the beach house in Charleston to? Nobody. Let's not be hasty. So, you can go back and tell your associates if I'm gonna give up my beach house in Charleston, I have a few demands of my own. You might want to write this down. ♪ ♪ You should know I'm in no position to negotiate. Oh, that's good because my terms are non-negotiable. First, I want 50% of the take. What? Second, I want Jordan Hamlin dead. Assassinated, and you should, too. Because without my testimony, he won't be in jail, which means he's definitely gonna come after us. That's an excellent point. Third, I want Paul McCartney. Write it down. Paul McCartney? I could probably get Ringo in a push. He owes me a favor, but I can't get Paul McCartney. I can't even get decent tickets for Paul McCartney. She's not talking about the Paul McCartney. She's talking about her dog. She named her dog Paul McCartney? She did. She is mental. I got that feeling. All right, where's the bloody dog? Impounded by the FBI after Leah was taken custody. So, he's at least local. Yeah, we can get him out no problem. The problem is, I'm not about to give that woman 50% of my take. Our take. We're working together now, remember? Well, why don't you make yourself useful and go and assassinate Jordan Hamlin for me, would you? Can we please just try to do this without killing anybody? [Scoffs] Is he still like this? I know. Does he not know we're gangsters? Well, he has the whole gentleman-bandit thing going on. I know, it's ridiculous, isn't it? All right, all right. We need to find another counterfeiter. There is no other counterfeiter. Leah's product is undetectable. Then we need to figure out a way around her conditions. [Sighs] All right. Leave it to me. I'll think of something. I'm not helping you with your con. I'm not asking for your help. [Sighs] But if I were... Oh, for Heaven's sakes, all you have to do is get the dog. What do you mean? The dog. You know how people are about their animals. You remember Whiskers. Oh, Whiskers. I used to love Whiskers. Exactly. So, all you have to do is get Paul McCartney and hold him hostage and lock him up until she caves on her other demands, which she will. [Chuckles] You are good, aren't you? Does this mean you're gonna come back to work? For you? For the firm. It's your family, as well, you know? Yeah, I'm not feeling very familial at the moment, about you or Ben. Oh. That because of Alice Vaughan? How is all that? Is she horrible? She is. She's beautiful. She's smart. She doesn't trust anyone or anything. And she's in love with Benjamin Jones. That sounds like someone we both know. No, no, you don't understand. She's not in love with Christopher Hall. She's in love with Benjamin Jones. He's told her his name? Bloody hell. What else has he told her? We haven't got there yet. Why? What have you been doing? It's a delicate process. So you don't know anything? What I do know is that the entire time he was lying to her about what he was, he was also lying to me about the cons and the money and everything. Oh, that is bad because that means that Alice Vaughan is not the problem. The problem... is Benji. [Heavy breathing] How many views since the release? Danny : 4.4 million and climbing. How could we not have stopped this? We tried. I called TMZ, Insindiary. I begged. I threatened. Sophie : Well, Nathan didn't break any laws. He owns Kelsey's image and Tyler's, and the video was shot in his studio with his cameras. It's technically a performance. And it's selling through the roof. So is Kelsey's album. Nathan was right. His strategy worked. Everyone knows who she is now. Is she okay? She turned off her phone. She's not answering. Did you try Tyler? I texted and left messages, but... [Computer dings] Guys, Kelsey just tweeted, "Taking matters into my own hands." Alice : That can't be good. She geo-tagged the tweet. She's at Nathan's. We should get to her before she gets to Nathan. [Siren wailing] Excuse me. Oh, my God. Kelsey. Sophie! What happened? I found her in the tub. She O.D.'d. Nathan. Oh, my God. You did this to her! Tyler, don't! If she dies, you killed her! Do not do it, Tyler. Don't do this. Stop! Enough. Alice : Nathan, enough! Enough! Let go of me! [Groans] Nathan : Thank you, Ms. Vaughan. Imagine how many hits we're gonna get on this video. [Camera shutters clicking] ♪ ♪ Tonight, singer-songwriter Kelsey Braddock has been hospitalized after an alleged drug overdose. Kelsey's producer, Nathan Ashmore, had this to say. Kelsey and I would like to thank her fans for their thoughts and for their prayers, and she wants me to let you guys know that we will see you on the road later this year to support her record. Did he just announce a tour? He did. How's Kelsey? They pumped her stomach. Tyler's with her now. But the doctor said she's gonna be okay. No, she won't... not if she has to keep working for Nathan. ♪ ♪ Margot : You say you're done with him, but you're still going after the people he works with. Why? I mean, you got your money back. You got the answers you were looking for. What do you want from them? I don't know. Justice? Revenge? It's probably not the healthiest way of moving on. I should just let it go. I should just move on. [Sighs] But then there's some... tiny, terrible little piece of me that just needs to have been right about him... that he actually is a good person, that he is that man I fell in love with. And that were it not for these other people, he'd be that guy. We'd have a chance. And I wouldn't have wasted a year of my life with somebody who... who didn't love me. I should just let him go. But then that terrible, tiny, little piece of me just keeps asking, "What if... he's the love of my life?" I think the love of your life is always the love you can't have. Is that all this is... me just wanting what I can't have? [Door opens] How'd it go with Leah? It worked, didn't it? Yeah, it worked. A brilliant solution, even if I do say so myself. Well, if that's what you want to call it. Why, what would you call it? A new low. ♪ ♪ Sir Paul. She got the message. And the paperwork? She signed it the minute she got back to her room. Jules : Her name is Leah Wells. So the Kensington Firm may be looking for a stateside counterfeiter. If they are, they'll have to move quickly. Leah signed a transfer request. She's moving to a different hotel. She'll be on the move, out in the open. He'll try to intercept. Mm. If he does, I'll be there. We'll be there. We're doing this together. Ms. Vaughan, I strongly suggest... What time is the transfer? 4:00. Then we'd better get going. [Scoffs] You'd better get going. ♪ ♪ [Indistinct conversations] We need to leave. How many agents? There's at least three Feds, more on the way. Then we go now. That's what I'm saying. No, I mean the job. We take Leah now, ahead of schedule. Are you out of your mind? Yeah. You knew that, didn't you? [Elevator bell dings] This is a mistake. We've got two U.S. Marshals on this floor, three Feds in the lobby, and two more Marshals on the way. Well, this is a mistake. There should be two Marshals outside Leah's door. Why is that door open? What the hell? They're alive. I'm guessing drugged. Never mind them. My counterfeiter's gone. So are we. [Elevator bell dings] Man : Room 638 is right this way. ♪ ♪ It's right there. [Knock on door] Jules : FBI. Open the door. [Knocking continues] No balcony. FBI. Open the door. Windows are sealed. Leah Wells, are you in there? There's no adjoining room. [Knocking on door] Jules : FBI. Open up. Rhys. Rhys, put the gun away. FBI. Open this door. Can you open the door? Behind me. Who the hell are you? Okay, we can all put our guns down. Put your gun down. Them first. Trust me. Backup is on the way. Backup? Hey, stand down. Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? FBI. Agent Jules Dao. Copy that. I got them. Now answer the question. Who are you? U.S. Marshal, and you're not authorized to be here. Copy. My ASAC would like a word with you. This way. Please. I-I'm sorry, Marshal. What did you say your name was again? ♪ ♪ You didn't have to kill anybody. They saw our faces. How else was I supposed to get us out of there? Oh, so you got us out of there? Oh, now you're gonna have a go at me, as well, are you? Wait, hold on. Where's Paul? Who the hell's Paul? McCartney! The dog! The dog's gone? The dog and the package are both gone?! Rhys. Reporter : We have very few details right now, but the victim has been identified as Jordan Hamlin, L.A.'s alleged crime kingpin. Local authorities have yet to identify key suspects in the homicide, but we are just getting word that it was Hamlin being transported... Margot. From the courthouse back to his holding cell after today's hearing. [Cellphone vibrating] [Beep] You thieving bitch! You never learn. The most important thing is to know your mark. Exactly... my mark! I didn't mean Leah. Obviously, if you're going into business with someone, it's a boneheaded strategy to threaten their dog. I suppose you killed Hamlin, too, did you? A proper business relationship requires a solid foundation. You're absolutely right about that. But you've played this all wrong. Have I? Hello, Paul McCartney. Yes. Because you didn't just steal from me. You stole from Mummy. And I'm going to tell. [Beep, click] Did you know about this? Were you helping her? No, of course not, Rhys. If you want to keep a certain redhead healthy and happy... Yeah, that's right. I know all about you and Alice Vaughan. And I can't wait to meet her. So, for both your sakes, I suggest you stay loyal to me. I'm just gonna call my mum. Tell me again why we're in business with these people. [Sighs] You needed to find out the truth. And in the process, I ended up lying to all of you. I did to you what Christopher did to me. No, Alice. Please. But I'm done now. With Christopher? The Kensington Firm... all of it. It's Dao's problem now. Not ours. [Sighs] We have Kelsey to think about. They're both so young. How old are they? Sophie : Kelsey's 20. Tyler's 19. And how long have they been at Nathan's? Two years. Which means that Tyler was almost 18 when Nathan started filming him. Oh, my God. Nathan recorded a minor having s*x. Which means he can be charged with possession of child pornography. And child exploitation with intent to distribute, which is 5 to 20 years in jail. Who are you calling? Our friend at the FBI. Nathan Ashmore's about to discover there is such a thing as bad press. [Police siren chirping] Alice : With Nathan on trial as a s*x offender, PMG will have no choice but to sever ties with Ashmore Records, and you'll be free. The thing is, Nathan was right. People know who I am. They're buying the record. So what do I do? Do I just walk away, or... You do whatever you want to do. But on your terms, not his. Sophie : You can be an indie artist. You can sign a licensing deal with a label. You two can get your band back together. What was the name of it again? Do not tell him. I want to see the videos. There are videos? I want to see the videos. But the point is, whatever you do, whatever choice you make, we're here for you... whatever you need. Thank you. Mm-hmm. The Ukulele Twins? No. Mm... Tiny Guitars R Us? No. The Twee Sisters. That's actually really good. [Chuckles] Why won't you show me your videos? Why do you want to see them? Because you won't show them to me, of course. [Sighs] Good night, Daniel.

♪ Oh, hear me, Lord ♪ Figured you'd be less likely to pull a gun on me if I showed up with the authorities. You asked me to choose. ♪ The bad in every man ♪ I choose you.
