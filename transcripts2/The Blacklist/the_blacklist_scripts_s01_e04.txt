 Okay, you booked on the ground floor, like you asked, is that right? 
 Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you. 
 Anything else I can help you with? 
 No, that's all. Thanks.

 Hey. I forgot my badge, but I got to grab these records. 
 Look, just sign in on the form. I'll run you through the system. 
 I'm in a real hurry here. 
 I wonder if I can look while you run me through. 
 Go ahead. 
 COOPER : Where are you on Keen? 
 She's still looking into this classified homicide. 
 The file she has is redacted. 
 No way she finds out what really happened. 
 RED : You've discovered something curious about your husband, haven't you, Lizzy? 
 GUARD : Hey, you're not cleared to be in here! 
 Who's your supervisor? 
 COOPER : We need to continue to keep an eye on her. 
 She's testifying today in a case from her time in New York with Mobile Psych. 
 A Mexican drug dealer... Hector Lorca. 
 I want you at the courthouse. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 [ Telephones ringing ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. [ Sighs ] 
 What's going on? 
 I've got court this afternoon. Just going over some notes. 
 Mind if I come with you? 
 Nothing would make me happier than seeing Hector Lorca being sent away for life. 
 Why do I get the feeling that you're less interested in watching Lorca than in watching me? 
 I don't know. Are you hiding something? 
 Dembe made contact. 
 Reddington wants to see you alone. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 DEMBE : You're due in Port-au-Prince at noon if we're gonna make your appointment. 
 This won't take long. Bring the car around. 
 "It was only through the efforts of an FBI profiler "that suspicion began to fall on Hector Lorca, leading to his arrest and indictment." 
 [ Inhales sharply ] 
 Well done, Lizzy. Very impressive. 
 You are aware, then, that I'm due in court in three hours. 
 Your case is about to go sideways. 
 Why? What's happened? 
 Lorca's people have reached out to me. 
 Normally, I wouldn't give him the time of day. 
 He's a vicious, little drug-lord thug. 
 Certainly nothing there to hold my interest. 
 But their request is of great interest because it concerns you. 
 What's he asking for? 
 Transportation out of the country, new identity, passport, bank account, credit cards, as well as the proper introductions to reestablish his operations elsewhere. 
 And he wants it by tomorrow night. 
 For whatever reason, Lorca is under the impression he's about to be a free man. 
 I've got a witness testifying today who's got him cold. 
 Lorca's not going anywhere. 
 Something is going to happen, Lizzy. 
 I don't think you're going to have a very good day in court at all.

 Francesca Trevino was abducted from a school parking lot. 
 Lisa Molinera was taken outside a movie theater. 
 Bill Jackson... 
 He kissed his wife goodbye one day to go for a jog. 
 Miguel Romero, Daniela Morales... 
 Roberto Pena. 
 109 victims over the course of six years... 
 Members of U.S. and Mexican law-enforcement agencies preparing cases against the criminal cartel run by Mr. Lorca. 
 They were witnesses prepared to testify against him. 
 They are all presumed dead. 
 None of them have ever been found. 
 Mr. Pena, can you please tell the court what your connection is to this tragic situation? 
 That's my son, Bobby Pena. 
 He was a member of the U.S. border patrol when he was taken. 
 I never saw him again. 
 I know who did it. 
 I saw him. 
 I know who killed my son! 
 [ Grunting ] 
 WOMAN : Oh, my God! He's not breathing! 
 [ Gavel bangs ] 
 Get the paramedics in here! 
 Bailiff, secure the defendant! I want this courtroom cleared! 
 [ Gavel banging ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 What is that? 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 What is going to happen now? 
 If the juror can't continue, they'll bring in an alternate. 
 For now, we're gonna keep you in a holding area. 
 I'll take it from here. 
 What about my wife? 
 I'll go and find her. 
 I'll bring her back here. 
 Please. 
 They got Lorca secure. 
 Just got it from the EMT... 
 The heart attack was chemically induced. 
 That juror was poisoned.

 The manufacturer has replicated the specs of the FIM-92 with a few small improvements. 
 It's lighter, more consistent tracking. 
 I'm confident your client will be thrilled. 
 [ Speaks native language ] 
 [ Cellphone rings ] 
 [ Speaking native language ] 
 Put him on. 
 Mr. Reddington is not avai... 
 LIZ : Now! 
 It seems to be urgent. 
 [ Laughs ] Yes, you also have a few dozen of those. 
 Sweetheart, not really the most convenient time for me. 
 I don't give a rat's ass. Where are you? 
 Haiti. 
 Doing what? 
 Keeping up appearances. I'm a criminal. 
 The minute I stop being one, I become quite useless to you. 
 My witness is gone. Lorca's people contacted you. 
 What did they say, exactly? 
 What I told you is what I know. Beyond that, I really can't help. 
 A man's life is at stake! 
 A man's life is always at stake... and tragically low stakes, at that. 
 I shouldn't have to remind you I did not offer my services so that I could help you round up your run-of-the-mill drug lord or what have you. 
 You all seem to be doing a perfectly mediocre job of that on your own. 
 I'm after the big game, Lizzy, the ones that matter. 
 This case matters to me, to the hundreds of families who deserve to know what happened to their loved ones. 
 No bodies were ever recovered. 
 They never got to say goodbye, to bury their dead. 
 Did you say hundreds? 
 And no bodies have ever been found. 
 What? What are you thinking? 
 Nothing. You should go home, Lizzy. 
 Pour yourself a Chardonnay and move on. 
 Your witness is most likely dead. 
 I think you already know that. 
 And if what you're telling me is true, you'll probably never find him, either. 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 How you holding up? 
 Fine. 
 Nice try. But I always know when you're lying. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. I know all your tells. 
 Right now, you're telling me that you want to be alone. 
 And that's okay, but... 
 I just wanted to say what happened today is just part of your job. 
 You know, you deal with bad people, and sometimes bad things are gonna happen, and it's not your fault. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What's this? 
 Um... 
 It's... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I mean, besides the best day ever, right? 
 Right. 
 Hey, I get it. Bad day at work. 
 Come home. Don't want to talk to anybody. 
 Especially someone whose stitches are officially oozing. 
 It's so gross. I know. 
 And you park yourself in here and cheer yourself up with memories of better times. 
 [ Computer beeps ] 
 We were in Boston that weekend. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You had that job interview. 
 Yeah. It was a great trip. 
 Yeah. 
 God, when was the last time that we did that, you know, that we just packed up the car and got the hell out of here? 
 Because we need that. Like right now. 
 You have no idea. 
 I know. 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 [ Cellphone vibrating ] 
 Do I really have tells? 
 Lizzy, you're an open book, which is one of the things I love about you. 
 'Cause I always know exactly what you're thinking. 
 [ Vibrating continues ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 Keen. 
 RESSLER : We found out where they took Pena. 
 An eyewitness saw a white van leaving the courthouse. 
 They found it abandoned 10 blocks away. 
 Traffic camera picked up the swap car. 
 Apb got a hit on the plate from local P.D. 
 The desk clerk said it was a large black duffel bag. 
 There's no sign of him, Liz. I'm sorry. 
 Has forensics been through? 
 They're going through now. 
 So far, they found a hair on the bed skirt, but we don't think it's human. 
 The desk clerk said he saw the suspect with a dog. 
 We found traces of adhesive on the walls. 
 We think he maybe used tarps or plastic sheeting. 
 It's a motel room. 
 Should be latent prints all over, and there's nothing. 
 He's wiped the place clean. 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 [ Camera shutter clicking ] 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 [ Beep ] 
 What do you want? 
 I've been thinking about your case. 
 What do you have so far? 
 I'm at the crime scene. 
 Or what we think is the crime scene. 
 You didn't find anything. 
 Not much. 
 Tape residue on the walls? 
 How do you know that? 
 Look in the tub. 
 Run your fingers around the drain. 
 What do you smell? 
 Chemicals. 
 You see, Lizzy. Now I'm interested. 
 Why? 
 The Stewmaker is in town. 
 You're going to need a plumber. 
 The Stewmaker is a true blacklister. 
 The only fellow to engage when one has a particular sort of disposal problem. 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 He's a chemical expert who turns his victims into chemical stew, thus the  nom de guerre .[/i] 
 No DNA. No nothing. 
 He makes corporeal problems literally disappear. 
 But it's much more than the proficiency of his tradecraft that gets him on the list. 
 He's a... trophy collector... 
 Remembrances of his victims. 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 Memori morti. 
 Now, you've lost your witness and with him your case. 
 But the Stewmaker is the key to so much more. 
 He's served the needs of international syndicates, repressive regimes, anyone with a need and the means to pay. 
 The Stewmaker knows where all the bodies are buried. 
 He's got the answers to hundreds of unsolved murders. 
 So, how do we get him? 
 He's notoriously cautious. I don't even know who he is or where he bases his operation. And believe me, I've tried to find him. 
 Lorca knows. 
 If not his name, he knows how to make contact. 
 Yes. 
 I suggest you encourage Mr. Lorca to share that information. 
 The Stewmaker is obviously here now, but he won't be for long. 
 And if you let him slip away, he'll be as gone as his victims and you'll never see him again. 
 MEERA : We know that Luis Pena is dead. 
 We know about the Stewmaker. 
 My client has no idea what you're talking about. 
 Cooperate, help us nail this guy, and we can talk a plea agreement. 
 You were responsible for Luis' safety. 
 I'm sure you promised him all sorts of protection to compel him to testify. 
 This is on you. 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 The government is dropping this case. 
 That is a surprise. 
 You know, the thing about narco dollars is that they always seem to find their way into some pretty unsavory hands. 
 We've got files on shell corporations, numbered accounts, all related to a mysterious Hector Lorca. 
 But you're not such a mystery anymore. 
 You're bringing money-laundering charges? 
 Based on what evidence? 
 Are you dropping this case or not? 
 This case, yes. 
 But homeland security suspects that you may be laundering money through entities with financial ties to terrorist organizations. 
 That's a load of crap, and you know it. 
 Why would they think that? 
 Because we told them he is. 
 Homeland's gonna stick you in a nice hole someplace while we check it out, and that could take some time, you know. 
 Give us the Stewmaker, and we'll set you up in a nice, cozy supermax. 
 I don't think you really understand who you're hunting. 
 This man, he is much more dangerous than your agents. 
 I'll take my chances with homeland. 
 I'm a survivor. I like my odds. 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 Once I turn you over to homeland, it's beyond my ability to help you! 
 You've helped me enough, Agent Keen. 
 You've disrupted my business, my life. 
 You've embarrassed me, my family. 
 You think you know me, with your profiles? 
 You have no idea. 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 Come on! 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 We just got the surveillance footage from the airport. 
 What did you know about the transport attack? 
 How did he know where to strike? 
 I swear to God, if you had anything to do with... 
 What you're forgetting is we want the same thing, Agent Ressler. 
 Why would he kidnap Agent Keen? 
 What's his play here? 
 I have a contract with Lorca to personally hand him a new identity. 
 That's never gonna happen. 
 Your witness is dead, you lost Lorca, and he took Agent Keen. 
 I'd say my meeting with Lorca might be the equivalent of you falling on your ass and landing in a pile of Christmas. 
 We'll need time to set up a sting. 
 He's been evading capture for years. 
 He'll be more on guard than ever. 
 Any change of plans, and we'll lose him. 
 I meet with Lorca alone. 
 An FBI agent's life is in jeopardy. 
 There's no bargaining here! 
 When confronting complex equations, the simplest solution is most often the correct one. 
 You lost her. I can find her. It's that simple. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 Then understand I take no responsibility for your safety. 
 And the FBI backs off. 
 No surveillance, no wires, or you can find what's left of Agent Keen yourselves. 
 As soon as you have information on Agent Keen, contact me. 
 I'll get backup, and we'll take him. 
 RED : No. I'm gonna make him feel safe. 
 Lorca's gonna walk, and you're gonna have to just trust me. 
 Lorca's not going anywhere. 
 And I'll never trust you. You know why? 
 Because after tracking me for years, you've come up with one undeniable truth... 
 I only do what's good for me. 
 And that is a person you can trust, Donald. 
 Now let's go. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Lorca will have questions about you. 
 You'll need breviloquent answers. 
 Ready? 
 
 
 
 Good evening, gentlemen. I'm Raymond Reddington. 
 [ Sizzling ] 
 Mr. Lorca, I'm Raymond Reddington. 
 I didn't expect two of you. 
 Oh, this is Special Agent Donald Ressler of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Whoa, whoa, what... 
 It must be open season on the FBI. I like it. 
 He insisted, dying to meet you. 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 What's he saying? 
 He's telling his man to be ready to cut off your head. 
 You want to tell me why I shouldn't? 
 One chance. Make it a good one. 
 Better start talking, Donald. 
 Red... 
 Kill him. 
 Aah! 
 [ Clatter ] 
 He's also a wonderful dancer. 
 How do you think Red got you a new I.D.? 
 New passports? 
 Established Interpol data background? 
 New history, false prints? That's all me. 
 I'm not the guy you kill, Hector. 
 I'm the guy you pay. 
 And if I don't show up for dinner tonight, you're dead by morning. 
 Is this true? 
 It is indeed. Crooked as a Corsican highway. 
 He's an asset. 
 So if you're gonna kill my inside man, the least you could do is thank him first. 
 [ Speaks Spanish ] 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Your new life. 
 I hope it's an interesting one. 
 I've also arranged a flight to take you to Venezuela. 
 You just need to sit tight for at least 12 hours. 
 No. I'm leaving now, tonight. 
 Not with my assistance, you're not. 
 You're bad for business. You've made a mess. 
 You've abducted an FBI agent. I presume she's dead. 
 I don't know. 
 In any event, the city's locked down. 
 I can't have you getting busted with my fingerprints all over you. 
 When I arrange transport, it's flawless. 
 I won't compromise my people. 
 Every sat tracking system, every surveillance camera, every law-enforcement officer in this town is looking for you. 
 No way you're getting out of here anytime soon. 
 So just sit tight. 
 Take your new identity, catch a ride on my plane, and let me clean up your mess. 
 Full-service provider, huh? 
 Yes. 
 So, where is the man holding the agent? 
 You have a problem with me disposing of this bitch? 
 Agent Keen will soon disappear. 
 That is the price for taking everything I have. 
 See, that's the problem right there. 
 You let your emotions get the best of you, which is how people wind up in jail, Hector. 
 Stupid people. 
 I need the name and location of the man holding Elizabeth Keen. 
 Are you sure it is not you who's acting on emotion? 
 It sounds personal. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You got me. 
 It is personal. 
 I want your man. 
 So let me spell it out for you. 
 You get away. 
 Agent Ressler here saves Agent Keen. 
 He looks good. 
 And everyone feels better about themselves. 
 I need a name. Now. 
 I don't have a name. 
 And I have no idea where he took her. 
 Then good luck to you, Mr. Lorca. 
 [ Zipper closes ] 
 I have a contact. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 That is all. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Tell me about the suspect. 
 Got a contact from Lorca, but it's through a mailbox rental place in G-Town. 
 Name of the mailbox renter was an alias... Bill Conners. 
 We found his driver's license at the DMV and matched his fingerprints to chemical purchases in Maryland. 
 The Stewmaker has a name... Stanley R. Kornish. 
 Runs a dental practice in Kitzmiller, Maryland. 
 Not 100%, but Kornish is definitely person of interest number one. 
 COOPER : I hope you're on your way to Kitzmiller. 
 We are. 
 [ Beep ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Time to go. 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Dog sniffing ] 
 [ Dog panting ] 
 LIZ : My name is Elizabeth. I have a name. 
 I'm a person. 
 I have a husband. I want you to know who I am. 
 Dogs are not our whole life, but they do make some lives whole. 
 Dembe, would you dial the Maryland State Office of Animal Control, please? 
 [ Dialing ] 
 [ Ringing ] 
 Come on. 
 DIANA : Maryland Animal Control. 
 This is Diana. Can I help you? 
 Yes. H-Hello, Diana. This is Stanley Kornish. 
 I'm in a bit of a panic. 
 My dog has gotten out, and I've lost my cellphone with the tracking code. 
 I was wondering if I might bother you for the code and if you could reboot the application for this mobile device. 
 He's an emotional support dog. Please hurry. 
 My heart, it's pounding, and I'm hang trouble breathing. 
 LIZ : Who are you? 
 I deserve that at least, since you're gonna kill me. 
 I mean, you understand decency, don't you? 
 At the very least, I should know the name of the person who's gonna take my life. 
 I know the name they call you out there. 
 It's disparaging, disrespectful. 
 But it's not who you are, is it? 
 It's not how you feel about yourself. 
 What name are you referring to? 
 You don't know? 
 What name? 
 They call you the Stewmaker... because of the chemicals you use to dissolve human bodies. 
 Nature. 
 What about nature? 
 It's the transference of energy. 
 Energy... 
 [ grunts ] cannot die. 
 It can only be transformed. 
 Is that what you do... Transform energy? 
 That's what nature does when the body dies. 
 But you do it very differently. 
 Yes. 
 Faster. 
 Cleaner. 
 Better. 
 Go! Go! Go! Run! 
 FBI! Hands where we can see them! 
 Oh, my God! What?! What?! 
 Let's see your hands! 
 What? What? 
 Everything's okay. 
 No! No! 
 We're FBI. 
 No! No! Where... Where are you taking my son?! 
 He's gonna be fine, ma'am. 
 You're gonna be okay. All right? 
 He'll be fine, ma'am. 
 Are you Eleanore Kornish? 
 Yes. 
 Is your husband Stanley Kornish? 
 Yes. 
 Where is he now, ma'am? 
 I don't know. He isn't here. 
 W-w-what's happening?! 
 Why do you want to talk to Stanley?! 
 Where is my boy?! 
 Easy. Easy. He's gonna be fine, ma'am. 
 He'll be fine. 
 LIZ : What about family? 
 You seem like... a father. 
 You have kids? 
 A son? 
 A son, then. 
 How old is he? How old is your son? 
 He's 11. 
 My son... He's 11. 
 I married late. 
 She's a n-nice woman. 
 I knew it. 
 A caring father. 
 What about you? Are you a mother? 
 No. 
 That's good. 
 I was... I was asked to make you suffer. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. It's my job. 
 It's my job to read people. 
 And you're not a killer. 
 I'm a lot of things, Liz. 
 There's a nerve cluster just under the shoulder muscle. 
 Just wait. 
 The pain should be quite intense. 
 [ Screams ] 
 My husband's a dentist. 
 He would never do anything wrong. 
 Where do you think he might be now, Mrs. Kornish? 
 Oh, it's the weekend. H-he likes to get away. 
 He goes fishing. 
 Where does he fish? 
 We have a little cabin up in... 
 I don't go...there. I-it's his place. 
 Tell us about the cabin. 
 It's not far. Up at Backbone Mountain. 
 Kind of in the middle of nowhere. 
 Near Lamb Knolls, I think. 
 What's the name of the road? 
 [ Sighs ] Up there, they don't have names. 
 Some of the roads aren't even roads. 
 They're just dirt paths to the woods. 
 Please, I have to know. What has Stanley done? 
 I need a chopper now. 
 I want tact ops on site within the hour. 
 And call ahead to forestry. 
 We're gonna need guys that know those woods. 
 We're getting very close, Dembe. 
 Pull in at the next shop. We're gonna need meat. 
 Tell me, how does it work? 
 How do you make them disappear so perfectly? 
 It is perfect, isn't it? 
 [ Inhales sharply ] 
 What did you give me? 
 STANLEY : A sedative. 
 It'll eventually cause paralysis, yet maintain your sensitivity to pain. 
 Hey, you don't have to watch this. Go on. 
 Why don't you go play? Go. 
 Why are you doing this?! 
 You don't take life. You clean up death. 
 Everything changes. 
 Everything evolves. 
 This is my evolution. 
 You know what I think? 
 I think this idea of you vanishing people to aid nature is a lie. 
 I think you're trying to dissolve something else. 
 Your past, maybe? 
 Whatever the horrible thing was that twisted you up inside and made you into the freak that you are! 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Police radio chatter ] 
 RESSLER : We're gonna run two team lines here... 
 One from Lamb Knolls to the southwest road, the other from the fire road back to the lake. 
 Let's move! 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Barking ] 
 [ Clatter ] 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 You know, I was wrong about you. 
 You're not perfect. 
 Hello, Lizzy. 
 The effects will dissipate soon. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Okay. 
 Shall we get started? 
 A farmer comes home one day to find that everything that gives meaning to his life is gone. 
 Crops are burned, animals slaughtered, bodies and broken pieces of his life strewn about. 
 Everything that he loved, taken from him. 
 His children. 
 One can only imagine the pit of despair, the hours of job-like lamentations, the burden of existence. 
 He makes a promise to himself in those dark hours. 
 A life's work erupts from his... knotted mind. 
 Years go by. 
 His suffering becomes... complicated. 
 One day he stops. 
 The farmer, who... is no longer a farmer... sees the wreckage he's left in his wake. 
 It is now he who burns. 
 It is he who slaughters. 
 And he knows, in his heart... he must pay. 
 Doesn't he, Stanley? 
 LIZ : No, Red. 
 He couldn't help it. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe he could change. 
 Maybe he's not damaged beyond repair. 
 Maybe he could make amends to all those that he's hurt so terribly. 
 Or maybe not. 
 [ Sizzling ] 
 Where's Kornish? 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 We've had a little incident. 
 Agent Keen needs medical attention. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 How did you get in here? 
 That's a pretty blouse. 
 Get a medic in here now! 
 It's all over now. It's over now. It's okay. 
 Everything's okay.
