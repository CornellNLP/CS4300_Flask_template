 Mm. Gorgeous, boss. Trout? 
 Sea bass. 
 So tell me about your new lady, Kenneth. 
 Lydia. Owns a fruit shop. 
 Well, so long as you're getting your five a day. 
 Lovely out there, boss. 
 Quiet place to think, Ken. 
 And a cheeseburger with onions, please. 
 And one of those skewers with pitta bread for Michael. Right. 
 What? 
 You suit an apron. 
 Are you trying to do small talk, Helen? 
 Would I? 
 Ah, the guest of honour! 
 Everyone, meet Isla Rose Cabbot. 
 Ah! She's gorgeous! 
 Hi, Ken. 
 You all right? 
 You getting broody? 
 She's got your ears, boss. 
 Alan. 
 Annie.

 Get in the car, Kyle. 
 Come on. 
 (DOG BARKS) 
 Just do what he says. Get in the car.

 I'm fed up with it, Steven. 
 Yes, I cut the crusts off. Goodbye. 
 No, it's not crab paste. Off you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Ben. The fruit does not come back today. OK? 
 Coming in at quarter past twelve on a school night? 
 I was just round at Ryan's. 
 You were drinking, son. 
 Grounded for a month. 
 She's wasting her time. 
 Steven! 
 Steven, come back here right now! 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 (PHONES RING) 
 Feeling a bit worse for wear, boss? 
 Just a touch. 
 Did you and Michael enjoy yourselves? 
 Yes. 
 Where's Annie? 
 Sorry I'm late. Got held up at nursery. 
 Boss, we've got someone downstairs, interview room 1. It's serious. 
 Helen? 
 He's on his way. Yeah. 
 Morning, sarge. 
 Morning. 
 We cleared you a desk. 
 (GASPS) They've taken my son. 
 My little boy's gone. 
 They... they came to my door and said they were social workers, and they were taking Kyle. 
 They gave me a number, but it doesn't work! 
 Katy. 
 And Kyle's left his phone, so I can't get hold of him. 
 Katy. Just take your time. 
 Tell me what's been happening. 
 Your son, how old is he? 
 He's, he's eleven. 
 And the people who took him, how many? 
 Two, a man and a woman. They showed an ID, but I didn't see. It all happened so fast! 
 But they gave you a number? 
 Yeah... it's dead. It's not a real number. It doesn't work! 
 Are they... I mean, do you think they... 
 Do you have the number, Katy? 
 Um... 
 (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
 DS Cabbot. 
 There may still be fingerprints on here, Katy. 
 Annie, can you check the number? 
 Did they say where they'd take Kyle, or when they'd bring him back? 
 No. No. They just said... 
 ... they were taking Kyle to a place of safety. 
 So they knew his name? 
 Yeah. 
 You're sure, Katy? They definitely mentioned Kyle by name? 
 Yeah. 
 And they knew my name. 
 The number's dead. 
 Look, please, we need to get out there and find him! 
 Please! 
 We will, Katy. 
 But you need to talk to me. 
 What time did they show up? 
 It was about quarter to eleven last night. 
 I... I kept trying the number, because I thought it would work, at nine this morning when offices open, so... 
 Katy, this is DC Ken Blackstone. 
 He'll take you upstairs where it's a bit more comfortable, and you can make a full statement and give a description of the people that took Kyle. 
 OK? Come with me, Katy. 
 You're doing really well, Katy. Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Social workers have no record of Kyle or Katy Heath. Neither do we. 
 Well, at best it's some kind of administrative failure. 
 At worst, a child abuse ring. 
 Posing as social workers? It's high-risk. 
 But if it is that, and they knew Kyle's name, it was planned. 
 If it's a false alarm we can always de-escalate. 
 If not, we're looking at a Cat A inquiry, suspected child abduction. 
 Annie, what with your new circumstances, I'd understand if you didn't want to be thrown in at the deep end. 
 DS Cabbot's not the first police officer in history to have a baby. 
 DI Morton. I need the duty officer at Regional, Cat A priority, suspected child abduction. 
 She's right. I'm fine. 
 OK. 
 I know I'm new to this motherhood thing, but if someone turned up at my door late at night, even real social workers, and tried to take Isla, I'd be kicking and screaming the place down. 
 She just stood aside and let her son go. 
 I'm getting bad dreams again. 
 Shh. 
 You'll be OK. 
 But actually waking up, you know? 
 I can't breathe. 
 It was never going to be easy. 
 But it's what brought us together. 
 We chose this, Chelsea. 
 I never forced you to do anything. 
 Did I ever force you to do anything you didn't want to do? 
 No, you didn't. 
 But I'm just not sure it's... right. 
 Do you trust me? 
 Chelsea? 
 Do you trust me? 
 Yes. 
 So you're happy these are good likenesses? 
 Yeah. 
 Just to reiterate, Katy, what age was the man? 
 Um, 40s. 
 She was younger. 30s maybe. 
 Annie, get these circulated to the media. 
 What about Kyle's father? 
 We're not together. 
 Does he see Kyle? 
 One day a month. 
 We don't get on. 
 He never wanted Kyle. 
 I tried to block access. 
 Why? 
 He's a criminal. He's been in gaol. 
 What for? 
 Don't know. Fraud or something. 
 He's not a good role model for Kyle. 
 We'll need a name and address. 
 Paul David Cain. 
 I'll action a TIE. 
 Thanks. 
 Katy, is there anyone you'd like us to call for you for support? 
 I don't really have many friends... 
 I don't mix with the neighbours. 
 What about a boyfriend? 
 Well, when you're on your own... 
 I don't want different men coming in and out of Kyle's life. 
 Sure. I understand. 
 What about family? 
 No. 
 Aren't your parents around? 
 I don't get on with them. Never have. 
 Moving around all the time. 
 My dad was in the army. A cook. 
 We were never in one place for more than a year. 
 Weren't your family in the military, Helen? 
 Oh. My father was in the RAF. Ground crew. 
 I hated my childhood. Couldn't get away from home quick enough. 
 I loved my childhood. 
 (RAISED VOICES) (CHILD CRIES) 
 (DOG BARKS) (SHOUTING) 
 Sorry about the mess. 
 Just don't touch anything. 
 We'll need a picture of Kyle. 
 Um... maybe in his room... 
 So, Katy, you opened the door. 
 Where was Kyle? 
 In his room. 
 Is this him? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, this is good. 
 He doesn't even like football. 
 He does now. In fact he's a Leeds United fanatic. 
 He looks happy. 
 So you didn't take this? 
 No, it must have been his dad. 
 That's where he lives. 
 We're going to have to make a public appeal. This is invaluable. 
 So you opened the door? Katy? 
 Sorry. 
 They said they wanted to come in. I wouldn't let them. 
 And then the guy from across the road came back, I don't know his name, he lives at no.92... 
 And you let this man and woman in? 
 The guy shoved me inside and shut the door. 
 Who shut the door? 
 Um, well, she did, I suppose. 
 Did they touch anything else? 
 I don't know. 
 Once inside, what did they say? 
 Serious allegations had been made, and they were taking Kyle to a place of safety, and then they took him away. 
 What did Kyle do? 
 Well, he was upset, obviously. 
 He was shouting and screaming for me. 
 Please. 
 Please find him. 
 (VOICES ON POLICE RADIO) 
 Stand back now. 
 All yours. 14 hours missing and counting. 
 Paul Cain, Kyle's father. 
 He's not home. We're trying his place of business. 
 He did two years in prison in the late '90s, financial fraud. 
 11 months ago he petitioned the Family Court for increased access to his son, which was refused. 
 Wouldn't be the first time an angry father tried to snatch his kid. 
 Turning to the worst-case scenario... Helen. 
 Yeah. Liz. Child protection register, region wide... known paedophiles, get them traced and interviewed. 
 Andy, through the records, anything with a similar MO, child abductors posing as social workers, anywhere. 
 I mean Europe-wide. 
 Ken, door to door round the estate. 
 Detailed timeline of car movements over the last 48 hours. 
 And, um... Annie. Kyle's school. 
 Teachers, classmates. 
 Sir. 
 I want a complete picture of this boy's life. 
 Routines, phone and social network activities. 
 If Kyle was targeted, they stalked him, recce'd... he had some kind of contact with them. 
 Boss, they've called a press conference at 12:50. 
 Right. Helen, can you get Katy ready? 
 There's a link between Kyle and his abductors. Let's find it. 
 I've just heard myself. 
 One of the parents phoned. 
 I'll call an assembly, tell the children. 
 Have you noticed any changes in Kyle recently? 
 Changes in behaviour, routines, anything to give cause for alarm? 
 I, I'm management these days. 
 I don't really have direct contact with the pupils. 
 Please God Kyle's OK. 
 Can you get me parents' permission to interview friends and classmates? 
 This is Kyle's class teacher, Mr Forbes. Joseph? 
 DS Cabbot. 
 Kyle? 
 (VOICES ON POLICE RADIO) 
 Hm. That's a pretty good likeness. Maybe a bit heavier. 
 He didn't look like a social worker to me. 
 More like a nightclub bouncer. 
 And the woman? 
 She had her back to me all the time. 
 Katy Heath, do you know her? 
 This side of the street and hers... very different worlds. We're in the good catchment area here. 
 That estate's a shithole. 
 Junkies everywhere these days. 
 So you were near the garden gate when you saw her? 
 Yeah. They talked to her for a bit, then went inside. 
 She invited them in? 
 I suppose so. 
 The man didn't push her? 
 I didn't see that. 
 What time was this? 
 Ten forty-five. 
 You're very precise on that. 
 I work shifts at the freight terminal. 
 Home at 10:45 every evening, like clockwork. 
 And later, did you see them leave with Kyle? 
 -No. 
 Did you hear Kyle shouting or screaming? 
 No. 
 Mrs Harris? 
 Is there something else, Mrs Harris? 
 I don't... I don't know. 
 I mean, it is terrible what's happened, but... 
 ... I'm not surprised. 
 That boy runs wild. 
 The mother works night at a pub in town, Bojangles. 
 Doesn't seem to have a babysitter. 
 The boy's out all hours. 
 I've seen him come home at one, two in the morning sometimes. 
 It's no way to bring a kid up. 
 Is it OK if I go? I'm helping with the search. 
 No, I wouldn't say Kyle was a loner. 
 Just... disengaged. So I don't really know that much about him. 
 Have you met his mother? 
 That's the trouble with parents' evenings. 
 Those that come are never those you need to see. 
 Why did you need to see Kyle's mum? 
 Kyle's... intelligent. Really bright. 
 I've not been teaching that long, but this kid... he's really clever. But... 
 ... the truth is, he's also an aggressive, disruptive little sh1t. 
 OK. Thank you. 
 Bojangles staff rota. 
 Katy works five nights, six till midnight. 
 Not what she told us in her statement. 
 Yeah, and she also said the man pushed her inside, but according to him she just let them in. 
 So our only witness sees these "social workers" arrive, but doesn't see them leave with Kyle. 
 And our only witness arrives at 10:45 every night, like clockwork. 
 Do you think it was staged? 
 There's a lot of questions, Helen. 
 Is Kyle still inside the house? Was he really abducted? 
 Is Katy hiding something? 
 Covering something up? 
 I want you to stay close to her. Family liaison. 
 She's hooked onto you, seems to want to bond with you. 
 We've got a dedicated team of FLO's! 
 I don't want a dedicated FLO. 
 I want an investigating officer. 
 You, close to the suspect, Katy Heath. 
 Katy, I need you to help me understand. 
 You let these people take Kyle. 
 No! 
 I was shouting and screaming, and the woman held me back. 
 But I was tired. They confused me. 
 Oh, God, I should have stood up to them. I was weak and stupid. 
 But I thought... 
 You thought what? 
 Kyle's dad... he's made up some story about me being a bad mother, and grassed me to the Social... I mean, he hates me. 
 It's not even about him getting more access to Kyle, it's about him getting at me. 
 Maybe he... he got these people to take Kyle? 
 He's got the money, you know, although I never see it, even though I'm bringing up his son. I mean, he owes me. 
 What he gives me is a pittance. 
 Or maybe Kyle's father is behind this. Have you thought of that? 
 We're looking at all possibilities. 
 I hope he is! 
 It means Kyle's still alive. 
 Could you two leave the house, please, Katy? 
 We need to do a full search. 
 
 
 
 (SIREN) 
 Family Liaison Officer means I'm the point of contact. 
 All information comes to you via me. 
 Anything else you think of that might help us, you approach me first, OK? 
 It's lovely out here, isn't it? 
 Mm. 
 It's also important to control the flow of information, so please, please, don't speak to anyone. 
 I don't have anyone TO speak to. 
 Except you. 
 Have you got kids? 
 Four boys. The oldest is fifteen. 
 So you're a mother too? 
 You think I'm involved here? 
 A full house search is routine. 
 We just have to rule out... 
 I'm Kyle's mum. I love my son. 
 Do you really think I'd, what... I'd kill him? 
 No. 
 D'you want another drink? 
 No thanks. 
 (TV: INDISTINCT VOICES) 
 Bloody hell. 
 Turn that up, please. Turn it up! 
 What, "his son"? 
 'Maybe if Kyle had stayed with me, this wouldn't have happened.' 
 b*st*rd! Did you hear that? 
 He walked out on me! He walked out on me as soon as I got pregnant! 
 'All I'm saying is, a boy needs a responsible father in his life.' 
 Alan? 
 'I know, Helen. I'm there.' 
 Thanks. 
 Now, I just want to find my son. 
 Do you think Kyle is alive? 
 Of course he's alive! 
 I have to believe he's still alive. 
 And I need you people to help me find him. 
 Now please. I need to see Kyle's mother. 
 Katy's not here. You can talk to me instead, Mr Cain. 
 Sir? 
 They've found something. 
 That's Kyle's dad. 
 Bring him in without me first. 
 Mr Cain? DC Blackstone. 
 Would you like to follow me, please? 
 Heroin. 
 (SHOUTING) 
 Thank you for coming. 
 I think Steven should explain why I've asked you here. 
 Spread betting. 
 What? 
 Your son has been playing bookmaker to his fellow pupils. 
 And as we know, the bookie always wins. 
 So other parents have been complaining. 
 Steven's been making quite a tidy profit at the expense of his fellow students. 
 I'm a credit to your maths department. 
 That's enough! 
 Watch your tone, please. 
 One more incident like this, and I will have to exclude your son. 
 I can assure you that won't happen again. 
 Three months grounded. 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 I'm going to have to leave. 
 I'll see you at home. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Half a kilo of heroin? Bummer. 
 Bummer? 
 If we arrested her it'd be counterproductive. 
 Katy's broken the law. 
 If she's involved in the abduction, we use this to break her. 
 Katy Heath's not going anywhere. We've got a big break. 
 If she's involved with drugs, maybe that's why Kyle was abducted. 
 Kidnap and ransom. 
 Helen... 
 Annie's right. Finding Kyle trumps everything. 
 Well, of course... 
 We're not arresting Katy yet. 
 But I need you to get her explanation of where that heroin came from. 
 Paul Cain's downstairs. I'll deal with him. 
 Kyle's school... anything? 
 Kyle's class teacher, Joseph Forbes, described Kyle as a disruptive little sh1t, unquote. 
 I'm running a full background on him. 
 He's in his late 20s. Our male suspect's in his 40s. 
 Yeah, but if we're dealing with a paedophile ring, who better to identify vulnerable targets than a teacher? 
 (DOOR) 
 Katy? 
 Look at that. 
 I need a word. 
 I don't know anything about drugs. 
 Sooner or later, you face a serious drugs charge. 
 Possession with intent to supply. 
 £250,000 worth of heroin. 
 It's nothing to do with me! 
 Does it belong to the people who took Kyle? 
 I don't know! 
 Katy, half a kilo of heroin under your floorboards and only you and Kyle in the house? 
 No friends, no family, no boyfriends? 
 Who else has been in this house? 
 What else am I supposed to do? 
 I need that. I'm on my own. 
 Who else has been in this house? 
 Men. 
 Boyfriends. 
 You told me you didn't have any boyfriends. 
 I meant no one regular. 
 I'm going to need a list. 
 Names, numbers. 
 And you're sure about that? 
 (DOOR) 
 Anything? 
 Well, no one's seen Kyle since school finished on Friday. 
 Apparently Kyle used to hang round with older boys. 
 I didn't get any names. 
 He's secretive. He's funny. He's a bully. 
 He's really brainy. Scary. 
 Always has a lot of money. 
 There's one lad here, Kevin. 
 I think he knows something, but he's not letting on. 
 OK. 
 Kevin, it's really important that you tell me everything you know. 
 Don't worry, you're not in any trouble. 
 Go on, Kevin. 
 On Saturday night, coming home from my Auntie Anne's, it was 12:00 at night. 
 We stopped at traffic lights, and I saw Kyle Heath, in Pleasuredrome. 
 Are you sure about this, Kevin? It's very important, and DS Cabbot's a very busy woman. 
 Are you sure it was Kyle you saw? 
 Yeah. In Pleasuredrome. 
 I was in Birmingham. 
 I had a meeting at my hotel yesterday. 
 Lots of witnesses. I was busy all morning, and then I heard it on the news, so I cancelled my meetings and drove straight back. 
 You moved back to the area a couple of years ago. Why? 
 My father retired. I came back to run the family business. 
 Do you have anything? Any kind of leads? 
 You recently applied to the Family Court for more access to your son. 
 Yeah. Which she blocked. 
 I walked when Katy got pregnant. 
 But it was her, not Kyle, that I rejected. 
 And she's never forgiven me for that. 
 The thing about Katy is, when she was young... 
 ... she was gorgeous. 
 She was cool, and she was quirky... she was like a star in her own little world. 
 And she thought that cos she was gorgeous, and cool, she would always land on her feet... 
 ... and she'd never have to worry about the boring stuff, like money, or where to live, or kids. 
 Some rich bloke... me, for example, would take care of all that. 
 Now all I want is a proper relationship with Kyle. 
 I get one day every month, and even then, he can't stay over. That's extortion, isn't it? 
 Now, Katy says she'd happily grant me more access if I'd come up with more child maintenance. 
 But if I gave her more money she'd spend it on herself. 
 She's using Kyle to get back at me. 
 It's not fair on the boy. 
 He needs a dad. He needs a role model. 
 He needs me. 
 Two years in Holdsworth prison for financial fraud. 
 That's got to harden you up. 
 Just the sort of place you'd meet people who might be willing, for a price, to kidnap a child. 
 I've got a business. 
 I've got employees who depend upon me... who have been working for my family for years. 
 Do I look that stupid? 
 I'll tell you this. 
 Kyle would never have been taken from under my nose like that. 
 I think Katy's involved. 
 Have you thought about that? 
 She gets all the attention, sells her story to the newspapers... 
 We're looking at all possibilities. 
 OK. 
 Can I go now please? 
 I need to search for Kyle. 
 I need to do something. 
 (MACHINES TRILL) 
 Excuse me. 
 Did you see this boy in here on Saturday around midnight? 
 Don't even think about lying. 
 Yeah. He's in here quite a lot. 
 Spends a lot of money on that one. 
 A lot of money. What's a lot? 
 £40, £50 a night, several nights a week. 
 Have you ever seen him in here with anyone? 
 Adults? A couple, maybe? 
 Not a couple, no. But Saturday night, there was a guy with him. 
 Talked to him for ages. 
 What did this guy look like? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I didn't take too much notice. 
 Could it... 
 -... have been him? 
 Don't know. Maybe. 
 Is there anything else you can help me with here? 
 The man went and got cash out. Over there. 
 Katy Heath. Another lie. 
 About? 
 Boyfriends. 
 Turns out she's had quite a few. 
 Six men have stayed in that house in the last year. 
 TIE's on them, any crimes against children or drugs convictions. 
 You might not want to bother. 
 Why not? 
 We got one set of prints from the wrapping of the drugs. 
 Not Katy Heath's. 
 But they do match a set we found all over Katy's house, the only set on Kyle's Xbox controller, his computer keyboard, his TV remote. 
 What, the heroin's Kyle's? 
 Career ladder for a drugs dealer. 
 You start at street level as a brother, get the order from the salesman, pick it up from whoever's holding, deliver to customers. In Manchester I saw kids as young as nine. 
 The drugs squad have picked up a few kids who were runners from the estate, but they hit a brick wall. 
 Can't get the name of who's behind them. 
 Boss? Pleasuredrome. 
 An amusement arcade on Rotherham Street. 
 Kyle's got a gambling habit, blowing 40, 50 quid a night. 
 Where's he getting that kind of money? 
 There's only Kyle's prints on the drugs stash. 
 So he's selling heroin and hiding it at home for someone? 
 And his mother doesn't know? 
 I can put him at Pleasuredrome from 11:30 to midnight Saturday, in the company of a man. I couldn't get a positive on our e-fit, but he used the ATM as the amusement arcade. 
 Males who used that machine, 11:30 to midnight Saturday. 
 Maybe we're asking the wrong questions... not "Where is Kyle Heath?" but "WHO is Kyle Heath?" 
 What are we doing here, Jimmy? 
 You didn't say we were coming here. 
 A lot of things I haven't told you, son. 
 I don't understand. He, he's just a little boy. 
 How can he... 
 Katy, this is about finding Kyle. 
 We need to know where he got the drugs. 
 I don't know! How would I know? 
 You must have some idea. 
 Do you know what your sons are up to all the time? I don't know anything. 
 He's out most nights till all hours. 
 No he isn't! 
 You work nights. You don't have a babysitter. 
 Here's what we know about Kyle. 
 He's involved in heroin and he's got a £50 a night gambling habit. 
 What? 
 Your 11-year-old son gambles. For God's sake. 
 Look, I don't know what to do, OK? 
 I can't cope with him on my own. 
 I was drunk when they took him away. 
 I was drinking all night because I worry about him, and he won't talk to me any more, and I was all over the place. 
 Kyle doesn't have a father, and I can't do this on my own. 
 But I don't deserve this, and I am fed up with you judging me. 
 I'm not judging you. 
 You think I deserve this. 
 You think I'm lazy and stupid, and deserve to have my son murdered. 
 You're changing the subject! What's going on? 
 Where's Kyle? 
 Where did those drugs come from? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know anything about him! 
 But if he's involved in drugs they'll kill him! He could be dead! 
 (SOBS) 
 Helen. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Annie? 
 Four names. 
 Four men who made withdrawals from the ATM at the Pleasuredrome on Saturday night. 
 Bloody hell. 
 Mark Campbell, head teacher at Kyle's school. 
 He was at Pleasuredrome with Kyle on Saturday night. 
 He knows the boy, knows his background. 
 This could be our man. 
 All right. Organise an arrest team. 
 Assigning me to a school, taking me off the front line. Good call, boss. 
 I want you to pick up Mr Campbell discreetly. 
 I don't want that lot crucifying the man before we've eyeballed him. 
 No showboating. OK? 
 Get this over to Katy. See what she says. 
 I'm really not sure I'm the sort of person Katy could bond with now. 
 Make yourself the sort of person she can bond with. 
 Annie? 
 If you question my judgement, or have issues with your assignment, talk to me in private, please. 
 You assign me to the school to protect me... 
 I don't need protecting. It's not fair on me or the others. 
 You're overreacting. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Anyone else after maternity leave, you don't bat an eyelid. 
 Why treat me differently? Why protect me? 
 Uh... 
 (MOBILE RINGS) 
 Banks. 
 Where? 
 I'm on my way. 
 They've found a body. 
 No... I can't say. It could be, but I don't know. 
 Right. 
 Look, I'm sorry I was rude to you earlier. 
 It's OK. We're all struggling, aren't we? 
 Not easy, is it, bringing up boys? 
 My eldest, Steven, they're threatening to exclude him from school. 
 What's this? 
 What's what? 
 My little boy is missing, God knows where he is, and you're moaning about... 
 What is this? 
 Sharing little confidences so you can get closer to me, win my trust?
