 MAIGRET: NIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS (2017)  
 Can we trust this person? 
 Isaac? 
 We're going to have to. 
 What if we wait a little, if we move the stones on here, in the new year? 
 We can't move them here, the police are all over everybody I know. 
 We need to move the stones now, Sarah, now. 
 Look at me. 
 Let's leave the stones and let's walk away from this. 
 Let's pack tonight. 
 What we already have will get us to America. 
 We'll be walking away from half a million francs. 
 We can do that. 
 If I'm not back by tomorrow morning,  I want you to take the items left in the store and leave here. 
 No. 
 - No. 
 I'm not leaving without you. 
 - It will not be safe for you here. 
 And I will be dead. 
 Oscar! 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 I took the wrong turning out of the town and spent ten minutes on the road to Paris. 
 Have you got the money? 
 Here, back it up! 
 Jojo! 
 Jojo? 
 Would you like some pastries? 
 They're fresh from the oven. 
 - Thank you. 
 - My husband has already left for work. 
 He'll normally eat two croissants in the morning. 
 If I leave them round the house all day I'll eat them, I know I will. 
 Just look at me! 
 If I put on any more weight, I'm going to have nothing that fits. 
 I don't know why I bother eating food any more, I should just glue it to my hips! 
 Morning, it's only me. 
 Good morning! 
 You know, one morning, you'll surprise me and say good morning back  and I'll probably have a heart attack. 
 Then you'll have to speak to another human being on the telephone  about where they should send the ambulance, and that'll upset you. 
 Turn that back on, please. 
 I'll get your coffee going. 
 The Michonnet woman has arrived. 
 Breakfast will be ready in the dining room in ten minutes. 
 Thank you. 
 I was hoping to find you risen. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Help me! 
 It is a sad day when a policeman dies. 
 I first met Claude Dumoulin 30 years ago  when we were cadets together, alongside a number of you here. 
 And after 28 years serving the people of Paris,  Claude deserved a long retirement. 
 But it was not to be. 
 The good heart with which he served the people  proved to be an exhausted one. 
 We thank you, Claude... 
 ...for your service and for your friendship. 
 I'm surprised his wife and family aren't here. 
 He hadn't spoken to Juliet for years. 
 Is he all right? 
 He will be, sir. 
 Once he's back at work. 
 So, are you taking your lady to the pictures tonight, then? 
 Well, the trouble is she only gets one evening off a week. 
 At the pictures, you can't really talk, can you? 
 You just sit side by side and stare at the screen. 
 Well, that's not the only thing to do at the pictures. 
 Janvier. 
 Chief. 
 Inspector Grandjean calling from Arpajon. 
 Louis. 
 It's been a long time. 
 Maigret, can you get some men to the Gare d'Orsay? 
 We have a suspect in a murder case who was seen boarding the Paris train. 
 - Which train did he get? 
 - We think he's on the 11:10. 
 Janvier. 
 His name is Carl Anderson and he may be armed. 
 Can you give me a description? 
 The man is tall, in his 30s and wears a dark lens in his glasses. 
 - He's travelling with a woman. 
 - His wife? 
 - His sister. 
 Embarquement immediat pour I'express de onze heures vingt  a destination d'Orleans sur le quai numero un. 
 Dernier appel. 
 Tous les passegers pour Orleans. 
 Are they policemen? 
 - Here. 
 - Carl, you're hurting me. 
 Quiet. 
 You're hurting me, Carl! 
 - I'm not. 
 - You're hurting me! 
 You're hurting me! 
 - Quiet! 
 - Police! 
 Let go of her! 
 - Put your hands up! 
 - Drop the case! 
 Drop the case! 
 - Oh. 
 - Drop the case! 
 Hands in the air. 
 - Carl? 
 - Turn around. 
 Hands behind your back. 
 Take him through. 
 - My sister shouldn't be here. 
 She is wholly innocent. 
 - Keep moving. 
 You have no legal imperative to detain her. 
 Miss, I need you to step out of the car, please. 
 She won't get out the car, Chief. 
 What's your name? 
 Where am I? 
 You're at the Quai des Orfevres  and what we need to do is we need to take you inside and ask you some questions. 
 Take me home. 
 I want to go home. 
 I understand that. 
 And, hopefully, we will get you home very soon. 
 Maigret. 
 Louis. 
 The neighbours say her brother keeps her locked in the bedroom. 
 They haven't seen her for over a year. 
 Take her home, I'll interview her there. 
 Don't let her talk to anyone. 
 Constable Bertinet will show you where. 
 And I'll talk to her, Maigret. 
 I know all murders have to be pushed by you here,  but we can handle this at Arpajon, it's clear-cut. 
 - Who's the victim? 
 - That we don't know. 
 There was no wallet on the body, so no ID. 
 But he was found in Anderson's car with a bullet in his head. 
 So was Anderson armed? 
 - Janvier, was he armed? 
 - He was, Chief. 
 Well, there we go. 
 Your name and address, please? 
 My name is Anderson. 
 With the given name Carl. 
 I am a Danish citizen, residing at the Three Widows House at Arpajon. 
 Remove your shoelaces and your belt. 
 - I will not do that. 
 - Place them in the tray. 
 I wish to maintain a modicum of dignity. 
 - If that is permissible. 
 - It's all right, Inspector. 
 Danish? 
 Can you remove your glasses, please? 
 - Has he asked for consular assistance? 
 - No. 
 I do not wish to receive consular assistance. 
 I am sure that after a brief interview  you will come to the conclusion that neither I nor my sister  are responsible for the death of the man in our garage. 
 Remove your glasses. 
 Who's the dead man in your garage? 
 I have no idea. 
 You've never seen him before? 
 Well, you're essentially asking me the same question there, aren't you? 
 - No. 
 - Well, if I'd seen him before I'd have some idea who he was. 
 And, as I've no idea who he is, I can't have seen him before. 
 They're both questions concerning identity. 
 Would you like to rephrase? 
 - Now you listen to me... 
 - Just tell us what happened this morning. 
 The Michonnet woman arrived with her overcooked pastries. 
 She's the neighbour who raised the alarm. 
 She works for you? 
 She provides food. 
 Of a description. 
 For which I pay what I can. 
 She doesn't really work for me, but is the type of busy-brained woman who enjoys being of service. 
 - And who... 
 - What time was this? 
 Usually, it's at eight, unless she's really got her teeth into the overcooking when it might be 8:15. 
 What happened then? 
 Well... 
 I saw her scurrying out in a flap, like an alarmed goose  and, when I went to investigate her concern, I found a dead man in my car. 
 How did he get there? 
 I cannot help you with that. 
 Is this your gun? 
 It is. 
 - Are you a collector? 
 - I am. 
 Of sporting firearms. 
 Both from the field and from the gaming table. 
 Why were you in possession of it when you were arrested? 
 I cannot help you with that. 
 - What does that mean? 
 - Well, I think it's quite clear what it means. 
 I didn't know it was in my possession. 
 I believed it to be in Arpajon with my collection. 
 When you saw a dead man in your car... 
 ...why did you and your sister make a run for it instead of calling the police? 
 My sister, Else, I... 
 I cannot help you with that. 
 Hello, this is Inspector LaPointe of the Police Judiciaire. 
 I'd like to do a background check on a Danish national we have in custody. 
 His name is Carl Anderson. 
 He's 33 years old... 
 Yesterday, we had supper at eight in my sister's bedroom. 
 - Provided by your neighbour? 
 - I threw together an omelette. 
 It is not beyond my ability  to provide a little bachelor's supper. 
 Then I locked my sister's door at 8:30 and retired to bed myself. 
 - Who are you? 
 - Goodness, haven't you been paying attention? 
 The Danish embassy say they have no knowledge of a Carl Anderson matching your description... 
 - I am sure they do. 
 - .. who has lived in Arpajon or any part of France. 
 - It's a common Danish name. 
 - So... 
 Who are you? 
 My name is Anderson and I reside... 
 Do you think I won't find out who you are? 
 Or I won't contact your family and tell them what you've done, that you keep your sister prisoner,  you've committed murder? 
 Why do you lock up your sister? 
 To protect her. 
 From what? 
 From it all. 
 From temptation, humanity. 
 From finding dead men in her home! 
 I protect her from it all. 
 If you'd like to take a seat, I'm sure we can make some coffee. 
 Excuse me, miss... 
 Excuse me, miss? 
 Was the Derringer the murder weapon? 
 It was fired recently, so it looks likely. 
 - I'll get Moers to run some tests. 
 - No need to involve Moers. 
 It's obviously the same calibre. 
 - I've already sent Moers to Arpajon. 
 - When? 
 I wanted him to see the dead body before it was moved. 
 - I've already ordered it to be moved. 
 - I stopped that. 
 There's nothing here that Grandjean can't handle, is there? 
 I'd just like to sit with it for a day or two. 
 There are some things I don't understand. 
 Like what? 
 I understand it. 
 He hid the body in his car to get rid of it later. 
 But why in the front seat and not the boot? 
 I don't know. 
 He's an oddball? 
 He likes being around dead bodies? 
 He was found with the body, with the weapon and he was trying to do a runner. 
 And yet that didn't disturb him. 
 I almost believe him when he says he can't help us with that. 
 - He's lying. 
 - Maybe. 
 But what did disturb him was when you mentioned his family and his sister. 
 I'd like to find out why. 
 Another day. 
 I was surprised you weren't at the funeral this morning, Grandjean. 
 - Didn't you and Dumoulin work together at the 8th? 
 - We did, yes. 
 Right. 
 You should have been there, Louis. 
 How did he die? 
 Alone. 
 He'd been dead three weeks. 
 There were bottles everywhere. 
 That's no way to go. 
 No. 
 No, it isn't. 
 - Who's that? 
 - That must be the husband of the woman who does the cooking. 
 Well, I don't envy you this afternoon, Chief. 
 Why's that? 
 You've got two women waiting for you inside. 
 One's barricaded herself in her bedroom, the other one won't stop talking. 
 So I said to him, 'I'll put the coffee on', I said, but he didn't turn round. 
 He's a weird man. 
 He has weird ways, with his blacked-out glasses  and not wanting to know anyone, he's very difficult to engage with. 
 I often feel like I have to talk for us both and end up having a conversation entirely with myself. 
 Is it usual for you to put the coffee on? 
 Yes, but this morning it was out of paraffin, so I had to go into the garage and fetch some. 
 The paraffin's kept in the garage? 
 That's right, yes. 
 And then I went... 
 into the garage. 
 Which I'm not going to do again, however much you try and force me! 
 No-one's going to try to force you to do anything. 
 - Moers? 
 - I hope you're not going to ask me if I know who he is, Maigret. 
 His clothes are from all over the place. 
 The suit's English. 
 The shirt's French. 
 - What weapon was used? 
 - A small pistol. 
 Close range. 
 You can see the scorch marks on his skin and that kind of burn means  that the barrel of the gun would have been less than two inches away. 
 - And when was he shot? 
 - From the temperature of his body, less than 12 hours ago. 
 So after midnight. 
 Like all the good murders. 
 And... 
 I found... 
 this skullcap in his pocket. 
 Was he killed in the car? 
 Well, there are no arterial blood stains,  no brain matter spoiling the interior, so, no. 
 In the garage? 
 There's no blood anywhere, so, no. 
 He was killed somewhere else. 
 Poor soul. 
 What are you doing? 
 If his clothes are from all over the place he might travel for a living. 
 And the item of clothing you're most likely to buy near where you live  are your shoes. 
 Come on. 
 Oh! 
 Are they for me? 
 They are, my darling. 
 From Rouen. 
 You always bring back something. 
 I'm such a lucky girl. 
 Thank you, Richard. 
 So, have they arrested the Dane? 
 - Yes. 
 - And charged him with murder? 
 It's all right. 
 I'm here now. 
 You've been so brave. 
 I have, I have been brave. 
 All day. 
 - Can I ask you some questions about last night? 
 - Yeah. 
 - What's your name? 
 - Oscar Vitanes. 
 How late do you stay open, Oscar? 
 We never close, do we, Jo? 
 Must be the busiest garage in France. 
 You get all the fruit trucks coming up from the country. 
 - Last night, did you see a young man arrive at the crossroads? 
 - No. 
 Mid-thirties? 
 Homburg hat? 
 Is that the one who's dead? 
 They're weird over there. 
 The house is always dark after nine o'clock. 
 You hear him sometimes shooting his guns in his garden. 
 Not last night. 
 Hello. 
 I believe you wish to talk to me. 
 Does your brother always leave his guns out or does he lock them away? 
 Aren't you going to ask me about the events of this morning? 
 Answer the question, please. 
 May I have a cigarette? 
 Yes, of course. 
 He never locks his firearms away. 
 He likes them to hand. 
 Tell me what happened this morning. 
 A gentleman would light my cigarette. 
 Will you be a gentleman? 
 This morning, my brother came into my room... 
 ...while I was barely dressed  and he said there was a body in the garage and we needed to leave. 
 Did you know who the dead man was? 
 I didn't look. 
 But I won't know him and I'm afraid I won't be able to tell you how my brother knew him either. 
 Was it your brother's suggestion that you both leave? 
 Yeah. 
 I suggested we stayed. 
 I was sure that people would understand that if he had killed someone, there would be a reason. 
 So why did you go with him? 
 We only have each other, Chief Inspector. 
 We are all that remains of our family in Denmark. 
 And my brother... 
 My brother has lost our family's money. 
 It cripples him more than the loss of his eye. 
 How did he lose his eye? 
 In a flying accident. 
 There was a fire in his cockpit  and, by the time he could bail out, it had destroyed his eye. 
 - When was this? 
 - Three years ago. 
 Are you going to ask me another question  or can I go back to bed? 
 What does he do for money now? 
 He designs fabric for Dumas & Fils in Paris. 
 Is Anderson your real name? 
 Else? 
 It is. 
 Don't be frightened of your brother. 
 I am frightened of him. 
 There is madness in our family. 
 Our grandfather killed himself. 
 But only after he had killed others. 
 The Chief wants you to check on Anderson. 
 Sure, I'll ring down to the custody cells. 
 No. 
 He wants you to go. 
 He wants you to take away his shoelaces  and his tie, sit outside the cell and wait until he gets back. 
 - He's not going to top himself. 
 - Well, if you're there, he won't. 
 Go! 
 Can you keep trying the police in Antwerp? 
 See if they know of any Jewish businessmen fitting his description. 
 Oh, what have you got? 
 Guard! 
 Guard, keys! 
 Quickly! 
 Guard! 
 Come on! 
 OK. 
 I've got you. 
 Get the belt. 
 Hurry up! 
 Untie the belt. 
 The belt! 
 Hurry up! 
 OK, I've got him, I've got him. 
 - He's all right. 
 - Get him down. 
 Get him down! 
 Why did you try and kill yourself? 
 If I'm in here, I cannot protect her. 
 And I'm in here for good now, aren't I? 
 If you help me, I can help you. 
 How can I help you? 
 By being honest. 
 A dead man is found in my car, I am found with the gun. 
 I do not know how this happened. 
 I am being honest with you, Chief Inspector. 
 And it is not helping. 
 What is your name? 
 My grandfather told me once  one of the most regressive steps taken by society in his life  had been the growing authority of the police. 
 He said that now any ill-bred man could stand in a gentleman's drawing room and doubt his word. 
 He said the first time his father was visited by a policeman, he had him kicked off the estate. 
 What is the name of your family estate? 
 You are a gentleman from a small, well-bred section of Danish society. 
 Your injuries make you instantly recognisable. 
 It's just a matter of time before I discover your name. 
 What does it feel like to be so disfigured? 
 When I bailed out of that plane,  I thought I was dying  and I thought I deserved to die, and yet... 
 I found myself praying to God. 
 Calling to him for the first time in my life,  that if I lived, I would do good. 
 My life would not be pointless any more, I would do good in the world. 
 Chief. 
 The police in Antwerp knew immediately who our dead man was. 
 His name's Isaac Goldberg. 
 You see, they knew about some diamonds from a big robbery in London passing through  and they suspected him of fencing the stones. 
 Do you know a jeweller from Antwerp called Isaac Goldberg? 
 No. 
 - If they'd let him top himself, they would have done the world a favour. 
 - That's right. 
 - They're releasing him. 
 - What? 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 No! 
 Stop! 
 Wait! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 So, we've got Goldberg's car passing into France through border control at ten o'clock last night. 
 Which means that if he was shot in the early hours of the morning, he must have driven straight to Arpajon. 
 It's a blue Renault,  registration P3016, and we need to find it. 
 The Belgian police say that the diamonds aren't at Goldberg's place,  which means he must have come to Arpajon to sell them on. 
 And as they weren't on Anderson when we picked him up,  either Anderson hasn't got them or he has yet to shift them. 
 So I want him watched every second of the day and night. 
 Why have you let Anderson go? 
 Because I don't believe that he's of any use to us locked in a cell... 
 - Why the hell not? 
 - If you would let me finish. 
 ...and because, outside, we can put him under observation. 
 And, if he's guilty, he may lead us to the diamonds and incriminate himself. 
 Of course he's bloody guilty! 
 He was found with the murder weapon on him. 
 - The gun may have been planted on him. 
 - If you would let ME finish! 
 He was doing a runner, he tried to cheat justice by killing himself  and he was keeping the body in his bloody car! 
 We don't know if it was he who put it there. 
 Somebody may have set him up. 
 If he's guilty, he'll have Goldberg's diamonds somewhere  and when he moves them, we will be watching. 
 You always think you're right,  don't you, Maigret? 
 Always. 
 Down the years. 
 But I am not one of your bloody pit ponies any more. 
 This is my investigation. 
 I should have been consulted and I did not want that suspect released! 
 I think differently. 
 And you are not the head of this investigation. 
 Jean-Paul! 
 Yeah, she's good to go. 
 Move it on! 
 Richard! 
 The police have let the Dane go. 
 What? 
 Let's check the pressure, then we're good to go! 
 - Go and find out why. 
 - I can't ask him that. 
 You can, darling. 
 No-one will think it odd. 
 See if they're charging anyone else. 
 Is that you? 
 - They let you go? 
 - Yes. 
 What did you tell them? 
 The truth. 
 The truth? 
 Well, not all of it, of course. 
 They will be keeping us under observation, I'm sure. 
 So we must be above suspicion. 
 I was afraid I'd never see you again. 
 I thought, if they let you go, you might have continued running. 
 I only lost faith when I thought they weren't going to let me go. 
 I would never run without you. 
 Hello? 
 Is it all right to come in? 
 I'm sorry, I didn't know you were back,  I would have brought two plates. 
 Have they found out who the man in the garage was? 
 I believe they have, yes. 
 If you would... 
 ...leave the supper in the dining room, thank you. 
 And have they found out who the murderer is? 
 I think I might find it difficult to sleep tonight if you're still at large... 
 or if the person who killed him is still at large. 
 Sorry. 
 I've just apologised to your detectives for my outburst and... 
 ...I owe you an apology, too. 
 I guess, out at Arpajon, I'm used to getting my own way. 
 I should first have informed you of my decision. 
 I suppose it's only old mates who can shout at each other and it not mean anything. 
 Listen, erm,  Claire's coming up to Paris tonight, she's doing some shopping. 
 Would you and Louise care to join us for dinner? 
 I'm sure she'd love to see you both. 
 We've got men watching out at Arpajon. 
 I'm trying to make peace here, Maigret. 
 Thank you, Louis. 
 That would be nice. 
 How lovely to see you. 
 How long has it been? 
 - 16 years. 
 - We were just talking about it in the taxi. 
 Well, it must be. 
 The girls have long since left home. 
 - How are you? 
 - I'm fine. 
 - Sir. 
 Madam. 
 - Thank you. 
 And how are you, Maigret? 
 We were very sorry to hear about Claude Dumoulin. 
 Well, thank you, Claire. 
 But I'm well. 
 Maigret said there was hardly anyone at Claude's funeral. 
 - Well, I know the wives shouldn't get involved... 
 - Then don't. 
 How did he die? 
 He died alone. 
 That's sad. 
 I remember when the four of us used to go out dancing with the Dumoulins. 
 Do you remember those days? 
 I've chosen to forget my dancing years and yours, Maigret. 
 And you and Juliet used to come to my mother's apartment and we'd get dressed up together. 
 Oh, that's right. 
 Then we'd go to that little bar  and wait for them to finish training. 
 Do you remember? 
 Oh, I miss Paris. 
 Do you come to Paris a lot? 
 Yes, it's my fix. 
 I need one shopping day every two months or I'd go mad out there. 
 Madame. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 And he said, the younger son said to his father,  'Give me the portion of goods that falls to me.'  And he divided unto them his living. 
 I hope she stays there all night. 
 'And not many days after,  the younger son took his journey into a far country  and there wasted his substance with riotous living.'  I wonder what he's reading to her. 
 Bedtime stories. 
 Why don't you go round the back to watch, see if he sneaks out there? 
 Are you not enjoying my company? 
 I've had worse. 
 Here you are. 
 I'll take the 12-year-old whisky. 
 - So, what are you thinking? 
 - Was it warm? 
 About the paraffin stove. 
 And why someone had poured the paraffin down the sink. 
 - Had they? 
 - I could smell it. 
 Are you certain? 
 I think someone was making sure that that Michonnet woman went into the garage this morning. 
 - Has it started yet, Jojo? 
 - No. 
 - Evening, Richard. 
 - Evening. 
 - Jojo. 
 - Evening. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Are you still my friend, Louise? 
 - Yes, of course. 
 - I think he's going to divorce me. 
 What makes you say that? 
 I think he's got a woman in Paris. 
 And I know, I know he's had them before,  but... 
 this one's different. 
 Do you know who it is? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, how is it different? 
 It sounds silly, but... 
 ...it's just different. 
 Often, when he's had women before... 
 he's been more loving to me at home, because he's happy. 
 But he's just getting colder and colder, like he's preparing to leave. 
 - Oh, Claire. 
 - And I can put up with the affairs, Louise, but... 
 ...I couldn't stand being discarded, I couldn't stand being pitied. 
 I'm sure it's nothing serious. 
 This cheque came back from the bank, because he hadn't dated it. 
 It's for a place called Chez Mireille. 
 It's for such a lot. 
 I was going to go there yesterday, but I... 
 I couldn't face it. 
 I stayed in the hotel all day. 
 I didn't want to see her. 
 But would you? 
 Would you find out if he's keeping someone there? 
 - Oh, Claire, I don't think I should get involved. 
 - Please? 
 - Talk to Louis. 
 - Please would you find out for me? 
 Got to be careful, mate. 
 It's Jojo, right? 
 Inspector Janvier. 
 We met this morning. 
 Yeah. 
 A dozen men have gone in this garage in the past ten minutes. 
 What's going on? 
 Jojo? 
 Wahey! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 - Calm down. 
 It's all right. 
 - Something's going on inside. 
 I know. 
 You know the rules, boys. 
 Just let us in. 
 Everything's all right, lads. 
 Carry on. 
 Who's going to take my bet against the guy in the vest? 
 - Five to four against. 
 - You're on, Richard. 
 This is illegal. 
 This is an unregulated fight. 
 So? 
 Arrest everyone. 
 Lock 'em up. 
 Come on, Janvier. 
 It all looks pretty harmless to me. 
 Five to four. 
 You're on. 
 - You seem to know everyone. 
 - I like to keep an eye on things. 
 He's had enough. 
 That's it. 
 - Take it. 
 Give it back to me outside. 
 - There you are. 
 Make him think you're not going to tell our Chiefs. 
 Come on, then. 
 Doesn't seem like your kind of scene. 
 It isn't, but I'm always up by the end of the evening, because these lads just bet on their mates. 
 Claire thinks Louis is going to divorce her. 
 She thinks or she knows? 
 Has he said anything to you about a woman? 
 She's asked me to check an address where she thinks he's keeping her. 
 I don't think you should get involved. 
 She has asked me. 
 There have been women before in their marriage and she's managed to come to terms with it. 
 She doesn't want 'to come to terms with it'. 
 She wants him not to leave her. 
 Sometimes, I think you don't know what it's like being married to a policeman. 
 We have to come to terms with sharing you with all the bad things happening in Paris,  let alone Louis' other women or Claude's drinking. 
 Juliet Dumoulin would say how she, she hated spending every evening  not knowing whether Claude would come home or in what state he'd come home, she felt like a prisoner. 
 Do you? 
 I know you're not like those men. 
 But I do worry that, one day, you won't come back alive,  that I'll lose you to the job. 
 I should answer that. 
 Maigret. 
 Chief, Roland and I have spent the evening going through old Danish newspaper clippings  with a Danish dictionary and we found reports of a light-aircraft accident  that happened three and a half years ago. 
 It appears in the... 
 Dagbladet,  with the headline 'Man brae... 
 braendt I flys... 
 tyrt'. 
 - LaPointe. 
 - Sorry. 
 Erm... 
 - Did you find out Anderson's real name? 
 - I did, yes. 
 And you won't believe it. 
 I might. 
 Anyway, his father's coming in tomorrow. 
 My son's name is Sievens. 
 With the given name Carl. 
 My daughter's name is Else. 
 And when is the last time you were in contact with them, Ambassador? 
 They are the youngest of my family,  close from an early age. 
 And there was always something wild about them. 
 Illicit relationships. 
 Playboy lifestyles. 
 My son grew up with no sense of duty. 
 To his family or his country. 
 Your children are much changed now. 
 Your son is very religious. 
 And keeps... 
 My son is a vain and reckless young man, Comeliau,  who brought disgrace on us. 
 So... 
 five years ago, I decided to cut them adrift. 
 Both of them. 
 I stopped their access to the family trusts  and forbade them to use our name. 
 Did you contact him since his accident? 
 I read about the accident. 
 My eldest son contacted him then  and observed his religious conversion,  but I think it is nothing but an act. 
 When fruit is rotten it cannot ripen again. 
 I came here because it was my duty to inform you of his identity  and I trust that you will not release his name to the press  or his link to me. 
 Ambassador, your son is a suspect in the murder of a Belgian citizen. 
 Do you know if he has any connections with that country? 
 I don't know anything about my son's connections. 
 Nothing. 
 And I don't wish to know. 
 Ever. 
 I'd rather not tell Anderson that we know his real name. 
 - Why not? 
 - If he is guilty, I want him to think we're not getting anywhere. 
 - It'll make him confident and he might make a mistake. 
 - So what do we do? 
 Find out if Anderson really was the contact that Goldberg was meeting at the crossroads. 
 Here you go, madam. 
 Le train a Marseille partira du quai numero un. 
 - Where is she? 
 - Over there, sir. 
 Sarah Goldberg? 
 I believe you have my husband's body here. 
 I wish to see it. 
 - Anything happen last night? 
 - No. 
 He gave her a good read of the Bible and they went to bed. 
 Last night, the garage hosted some bareknuckle fighting. 
 Bertinet's on the take there and tried to give me a donation, so that Grandjean didn't find out. 
 The neighbour... 
 Michonnet was there. 
 Maigret's found out who Anderson is. 
 - OK. 
 - Go home, get some rest, but sleep by your phone. 
 I want to be in on any arrest. 
 It's open. 
 Good morning. 
 I was just coming to inform your spies that I have to drive to Paris this morning. 
 I thought that if they saw me drive off without a word, it would be deemed suspicious. 
 Why do you need to go to Paris? 
 Today is the 15th of the month,  the day I deliver my samples to Dumas & Fils. 
 The day I get my salary. 
 I... 
 hope that is permissible. 
 Of course. 
 But I have a warrant to search your house,  I thought you might wish to be present while the search is conducted. 
 I'm afraid I have to go to Paris. 
 And we'll be searching your sister's room, so we'll need the key. 
 Of course. 
 Follow him. 
 Are you not worried that my brother will use his trip to Paris to run? 
 No. 
 What makes you so confident? 
 Because I believed him when he said he didn't know Isaac Goldberg. 
 Was that his name? 
 Aren't you going to ask me if I knew him? 
 Did you? 
 No. 
 You may go back to your search now, Chief Inspector Maigret. 
 Carl believes that if he reads the Bible to me I will sleep the peace of the righteous,  but I often need a little help. 
 Don't you? 
 You seem a sad man. 
 Tell me why you're so sad. 
 A man I knew died last week. 
 He was a good and honest man. 
 But he died alone. 
 Unloved? 
 Forgotten. 
 By those who had loved him. 
 And is that what you fear? 
 No. 
 Don't be ashamed. 
 All men seek comfort. 
 All men want to be significant, I know that. 
 It's what unites you all. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Yehei shmeh rabba... 
 ...mevarakh lealam  ulalmey almaya. 
 I tried to get you to walk away from this one,  but you were greedy. 
 You said the more we had, the better our new life would be. 
 Oh, Isaac. 
 Where were you going? 
 America. 
 Don't judge him. 
 His was a victim-less crime. 
 People with those kinds of jewels are always insured to the hilt. 
 There's no such thing as a 'victim-less crime'. 
 When you have been through what we went through in the war, then you'll know a real crime when you see one. 
 I wish to see where he died. 
 Do you know who your husband travelled to Arpajon to meet? 
 Yes. 
 And I want them to suffer for it. 
 Them? 
 Was there more than one? 
 I want to say a prayer for my husband where he died. 
 And then I'll tell you who he was there to meet. 
 What are you doing? 
 I realised you hadn't eaten all day  and your brother said you liked omelettes. 
 My brother makes terrible omelettes. 
 Did your brother know Isaac Goldberg? 
 If your brother's not here, there's no reason to be afraid. 
 We spent time in Antwerp after his accident. 
 That jeweller was one of his associates. 
 Did you meet him? 
 Me? 
 No. 
 I was under lock and key at the boarding house. 
 But Carl would sometimes tell me who he met. 
 And Goldberg was someone who could sell things on, like my rings. 
 Who else did your brother know? 
 I don't know everyone, but he did tell of Goldberg. 
 And his wife? 
 She's on her way here now to tell us what she knows. 
 If you know more, Else, you should tell me before she gets here. 
 I don't know what my brother was doing. 
 
 
 
 Oh. 
 Here. 
 If he doesn't return, will you stay with me tonight? 
 I haven't been alone at night for so long. 
 Will you lock me in and protect me? 
 What's he doing back? 
 - What happened? 
 - I got run off the road. 
 - Where's Anderson? 
 - I lost him. 
 I'm sorry. 
 - You need to get that looked at. 
 - Who ran you off the road? 
 - I didn't see. 
 Get hold of Dumas & Fils and see where Anderson is  and get every highway unit looking out for his car. 
 - Can I help? 
 - We'll clean him up. 
 So you didn't see who ran you off the road? 
 No! 
 About an hour before she gets here, Chief. 
 - Be quiet. 
 Tilt your head back. 
 - It'll help. 
 - Why is that going to help? 
 - What my mum used to say. 
 - Oh, and she was a doctor, was she? 
 Just put some pressure on it and stop whingeing. 
 If Anderson's managed to get across the border into Belgium, we'll never find him. 
 It's obvious he knows his way around the underworld there. 
 Hello. 
 Maigret's. 
 - 'It's me.' - Hello, you. 
 Are you going to be home later? 
 'I hope so.'  I hope this will be wrapped up tonight. 
 Are you still thinking of Claude Dumoulin? 
 How did you know that? 
 Because I know you. 
 Are you smiling? 
 'So is Louis going to leave Claire for his mistress?'  How do you know I checked that? 
 Because I know YOU. 
 Chez Mirielle doesn't keep rooms. 
 But Louis rents a function room there every Tuesday,  so I told Claire she's got nothing to worry about. 
 Why does he rent a function room? 
 Poker. 
 And the barman says there are girls there, sometimes. 
 But it's just Louis meeting up with old friends. 
 'I never was one for poker.'  No. 
 But I think you'd be very good at it. 
 I will see you later. 
 'Bye.'  - What does Michonnet do for a living? 
 - He's a salesman for a... 
 Er, actually... 
 Erm... 
 I don't know what for. 
 Oscar, what does Michonnet do? 
 He sells bed linen to hotels. 
 He travels all over France. 
 If he moved house, I wouldn't sell half the petrol. 
 - Oh, you're late. 
 - Yes. 
 What's going on? 
 Why are the police hanging around? 
 The wife of the man who was shot is arriving to tell Maigret who he came here to meet. 
 - How do you know that? 
 - Jojo told me. 
 The police have been here all day, searching through the Dane's house  and they even came and asked me some questions, but I'm not sure I said anything very useful. 
 They kept asking about the paraffin  and that horrid little stove the Danes have got. 
 Here they are. 
 Do you want to talk to her inside? 
 Yes. 
 Get down! 
 Get down, everyone! 
 Stay down. 
 Somebody get help! 
 It came from there. 
 - Grandjean, lights! 
 - Direct the headlights! 
 Chief! 
 Chief, are you all right? 
 Yes, I'm fine. 
 - Where are the headlights? 
 - Grandjean! 
 Not on us! 
 Louis! 
 - Over there! 
 - Move the lights over there! 
 Stop or I'll shoot! 
 Give me your gun. 
 Give me your gun! 
 I want a lawyer, Grandjean. 
 - Put him over there. 
 - Get me a lawyer now! 
 Chief, Michonnet's revolver has not been fired. 
 Look. 
 Her wounds are those of a sniper's rifle, a hunter's rifle. 
 Get back out there and see what you can find. 
 All right. 
 - Get your hands off me. 
 - You murdering little worm! 
 - Get off me. 
 - I didn't kill anyone. 
 - Scum! 
 - Keep him away from me! 
 Keep him away from me! 
 - Only the lowest scum kill women! 
 - I didn't kill her! 
 - Louis! 
 It wasn't me! 
 I didn't kill her! 
 Get them out of here. 
 Out you go. 
 There was someone else out on the field. 
 Who? 
 I didn't see his face. 
 I heard the shots and then I heard footsteps running. 
 - In which direction? 
 - I don't know, because you came running. 
 And, suddenly, I just found myself trying to get home. 
 Why were you out in the orchard with a gun? 
 - I thought... 
 - Because he wanted to kill her like he killed that Jew! 
 Because he didn't want her to talk! 
 - I didn't kill anyone! 
 - The gun has not been fired, Louis. 
 His gun has not been fired. 
 Why were you out in the orchard with a gun? 
 I want to see a lawyer, Maigret. 
 I want to see a lawyer now, before I say any more. 
 - Richard! 
 What's happening? 
 - Here. 
 - Where was it? 
 Roughly 30 metres from where we caught him. 
 That's Anderson's. 
 I looked at it this morning. 
 I'm sorry, my darling. 
 - Why? 
 Why are you sorry? 
 - I'm so sorry. 
 - Go and see if it's missing from his collection. 
 - Chief. 
 - Surely you're not involved in any of this? 
 - Move aside, madam. 
 - We need to get him in the car. 
 - No! 
 No! 
 No! 
 You've made a mistake! 
 - Move aside, please. 
 - I'm so sorry. 
 No! 
 Richard! 
 Richard? 
 Richard! 
 Oh, no, Richard! 
 Richard! 
 The rifle is from Anderson's personal collection. 
 We found two casings in the orchard. 
 I think the coroner will confirm it as the murder weapon. 
 So Michonnet must have stolen it when he heard Sarah Goldberg was on her way. 
 - He said there was someone else out in the orchard. 
 - Well, he would. 
 - Anderson? 
 - Anderson's long gone with his pockets full of diamonds. 
 We won't be seeing him again. 
 His car's been found near the Belgian border. 
 And I don't want to criticise you, Maigret, but it was a mistake to let him out of custody. 
 So... 
 we're saying Michonnet and Anderson were working together? 
 Must have been. 
 They lured Goldberg to the crossroads. 
 They killed him. 
 They were going to dispose of the body later, the wife found it and raised the alarm. 
 - Since then, they've been running away or covering their tracks. 
 - Is that what you think? 
 Yes. 
 All right. 
 Get the paperwork together for the morning. 
 Let's put a lid on this. 
 Can you handle this, Louis? 
 I should be getting home. 
 Yes, of course. 
 And thank you for all the help. 
 It was great to have the old team back together again. 
 Right, who's got the witness statement from the mechanic? 
 That was me. 
 - Oh, you're back. 
 - Oh, I didn't want to wake you. 
 I didn't want to go to bed until you came home. 
 - Was it all right? 
 - No, it wasn't. 
 Are you expecting company or are you thirsty? 
 Chief. 
 Come on in, straight through to the left. 
 - Evening. 
 - Good evening. 
 - Oh, Janvier, LaPointe, oh, please, come in. 
 - Well, I'll say good night, then. 
 - Oh, no, please stay. 
 Please. 
 What is it, Chief? 
 What's the main reason that people get angry? 
 Because they get frightened. 
 And Grandjean has got frightened twice in the last two days. 
 Once, when you released Anderson  and once when Michonnet was about to talk. 
 So what's he so frightened of? 
 You think he's involved? 
 Ten years ago,  when he left the 8th,  there were rumours about why Claude Dumoulin got him moved out of Paris. 
 That he was on the take? 
 They were just rumours, I never really knew. 
 But now he and Claire are having holidays in Nice. 
 - We can't afford that. 
 - No. 
 Even if he is on the take, like with the boxing going on... 
 ...something like this, Chief? 
 Well... 
 Maybe he's got greedy. 
 Maybe he has. 
 Because if Michonnet told the truth  that there was someone else out there in the field tonight,  who could it have been? 
 Who wasn't there with us? 
 Grandjean's constable. 
 Bertinet. 
 Wait, so was Michonnet involved, at all? 
 I think he was. 
 Because the day after Goldberg's murder, he came home in a taxi. 
 Now, he's a salesman, he travels for a living. 
 So why didn't he take his own car? 
 Because he was driving Goldberg's car and he was going to sell it on. 
 And to sell it on, he'd have to disguise it. 
 And Oscar Vitanes has a paint shop in the back of his garage. 
 So, you think that all four are involved? 
 Every Tuesday night, for the past two years,  Louis's been coming up to town for a poker night. 
 That's right. 
 So what if the four men who play poker at Chez Mireille  and hire in girls  are Grandjean, his constable... 
 ...Michonnet... 
 and the garage mechanic, Oscar? 
 Not Anderson? 
 I think they set him up. 
 I think they planted the body in his car  and made sure that Michonnet's wife raised the alarm. 
 - Tomorrow morning, do a full check on Oscar Vitanes. 
 - Yes, Chief. 
 Try and find out where Michonnet went the day after Goldberg's murder  and if he was driving Goldberg's car. 
 I'm going to Antwerp. 
 Could I ask you if you recognise any of the people in these photographs? 
 - No. 
 - Are you sure? 
 No. 
 Have you ever seen this man before? 
 Have you seen that man before? 
 I'll pay for good information. 
 Who am I trying to recognise here? 
 Richard Michonnet. 
 He's not looking very well. 
 Have you seen him round here? 
 Asking about Goldberg? 
 No. 
 Louis Grandjean. 
 Never seen him. 
 And, if I did, I'd cross the road. 
 I can spot a policeman a mile off. 
 Is that it? 
 No. 
 One more. 
 No. 
 His name's Anderson. 
 He hasn't been around for about a year. 
 He turned up for a bit  and was a religious pain in the arse, if you know what I mean. 
 He tried to save fallen women. 
 He would stand on a soap box in the street and preach to thieves  about how they should hand back what they'd stolen. 
 He's an idiot. 
 What about his sister? 
 That's not his sister. 
 His sister died. 
 Oscar Vitanes was known to the 8th. 
 He's a former boxer who got into burglary. 
 Grandjean  personally arrested him on three occasions. 
 When he got sent to Arpajon, I reckon he set Oscar up. 
 Talk to him. 
 You tell him. 
 Chief, I reckon Grandjean moved Oscar into the garage  and they use it as a front to shift on the stolen goods. 
 Using the fruit trucks. 
 'Yeah. 
 It would be easy, they pass through there every day.'  Here. 
 Michonnet shifted some of the high-end stuff through the hotels. 
 'He was known to have a briefcase displaying rings and necklaces.'  And then a bellboy in Rouen said that he was driving a red Renault. 
 The same make as Goldberg's, the day after he was murdered. 
 'What do you want to do, Chief?'  Somebody's still got the diamonds. 
 Yeah. 
 When are you back? 
 'I'm going straight to Arpajon.'  Anderson's sister died of pneumonia two years ago. 
 The woman he keeps locked up is a prostitute called Emma Brandt. 
 'They are husband and wife. 
 My contact says that she knew Goldberg.'  She knew everyone. 
 She's the link between Arpajon and Goldberg. 
 - Are you working tonight? 
 - Well, it's Tuesday, isn't it? 
 I'm always on. 
 I thought, after all the work you'd been doing at the Quai, you might have a break. 
 If only. 
 What time will you be back? 
 I wouldn't wait up. 
 All right, Bobby? 
 - See you later, Jo. 
 - Yeah. 
 Keep an eye on things, Jo. 
 All set. 
 You and Oscar have a nice business here. 
 Yeah. 
 Just one thing puzzles me, Jojo. 
 Why so many trucks need new spare tyres. 
 Every time I've come here, you or Oscar... 
 are taking an old spare off... 
 ...and putting a new spare on. 
 Would you mind if I opened one up? 
 Tell me everything, Jojo, and I'll explain to the Judge that you've been cooperative. 
 Oscar will hurt me again. 
 I'll make sure that he doesn't. 
 He and Grandjean were doing all right till she came here. 
 Else? 
 She'd give her brother a sleeping drug and come over. 
 She talked them into spending nights out in Paris,  said she was dying of boredom over there. 
 'Grandjean would have done anything for her.'  'Was it Else's idea to try to get the diamonds out of Antwerp?'  'She talked them into going for it.'  Said it would cost them half a million to get them. 
 But they didn't have half a million, did they? 
 I said to Oscar, 'Don't get involved, it's murder', but she... 
 She said that... 
 That they could pin it on Anderson. 
 Yeah. 
 She said that if he was arrested for murder he'd definitely kill himself. 
 Couldn't bear the shame. 
 She said they'd get the diamonds and she could be rid of him. 
 Who killed Isaac Goldberg? 
 The man she promised to shack up with. 
 'Grandjean.'  'They'd dump him in Anderson's car.'  Get the Michonnet woman to discover him  and Else would convince him they had to run. 
 They said Anderson would look as guilty as hell. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Who is it? 
 Carl? 
 Carl? 
 What happened to you? 
 He... 
 tried to kill me. 
 Who did? 
 Bertinet. 
 That policeman. 
 I've come to protect you. 
 Where... 
 Where were you going? 
 - Nowhere. 
 - But... 
 Your suitcase. 
 Were you leaving because I wasn't coming back? 
 Sssh. 
 I love you. 
 Sssh. 
 And... 
 And God loves you. 
 He will always be watching over you. 
 - Emma! 
 - Oh! 
 Emma! 
 There's a few extra each, now that Michonnet's gone. 
 - Is this the end, then? 
 - You can do what you like with the garage, I don't care. 
 By the time you wake up in the morning, me and the girl will be long gone. 
 - Where are you going? 
 - As if I'm going to tell you! 
 If I were you, I'd get out of here, too. 
 See you around, lads. 
 Go after him. 
 Oh! 
 Now. 
 Hey, you, stop! 
 Stop or I'll shoot! 
 Thierry Bertinet... 
 ...I'm arresting you for murder and conspiracy to murder. 
 Don't be silly, don't be silly. 
 Coming to the station just now... 
 ...I felt free for the first time in... 
 ...decades. 
 Free of the job  and free of Claire. 
 Where were you going? 
 She said she'd marry me if I took her to Monte Carlo. 
 Surely you knew what kind of woman she was, Louis. 
 She loves me. 
 We'd have been all right. 
 Even if she doesn't love me... 
 anything would be better than going home again. 
 How did you get to hate Claire so much? 
 I don't need your psychology, Maigret. 
 You and Dumoulin, you should have been priests, not policemen. 
 But you're just a couple of mugs. 
 You keep Louise in that little place you've got, while others are lining their pockets. 
 Anderson's just like you. 
 He thought he was doing some good in the world by getting Emma off the streets,  but he was just her ticket out of Antwerp. 
 - What a mug! 
 - And what are you? 
 Apart from her ticket out of Arpajon? 
 You never could read people, could you, Louis? 
 Has he talked about what happened? 
 He said Bertinet stopped him on the road to Paris  and left him for dead. 
 He must have struggled about 20 kilometres back to the crossroads. 
 Is he awake? 
 He keeps asking for his Bible. 
 Carl? 
 There's someone here to see you. 
 No. 
 Don't. 
 Don't get up. 
 Is it her? 
 No. 
 Can you get a message to her? 
 Tell her... 
 Tell her to continue with the Bible while she's in prison. 
 'There will be more joy in heaven over one sinner that repents.'  I'll tell her. 
 And tell her I'll wait for her. 
 However long. 
 I think it'll be all right. 
 Carl's heart stopped on the way to the hospital. 
 Is he dead? 
 No. 
 He seems determined to live. 
 Why? 
 For the same reason that he struggled back to you with a bullet in him. 
 Because he wants to protect you. 
 He asked me to pass on a message. 
 - I don't want to know. 
 - He said, however long your sentence, he will wait for you. 
 I don't want to know. 
 When we found Michonnet in the orchard with a gun,  he was coming to kill YOU, wasn't he? 
 You'd arranged the deal with Goldberg. 
 And he couldn't risk Sarah Goldberg identifying you  and then you implicating him. 
 I liked Michonnet. 
 He didn't want to protect me or kiss me, or own me. 
 He just saw a scheme where he could make some money. 
 Men aren't usually that honest with themselves. 
 A fantasy  or a path to redemption  or a way they can escape their life. 
 You saw Carl and Louis as ways of escape. 
 Yes. 
 And there was a moment when I thought you might be a ticket worth buying, as well. 
 But... 
 no. 
 No. 
 Maybe all men want to trap you in the end. 
 And I was sick of that. 
 I don't think Carl wanted to trap you. 
 I think he loves you. 
 And, in his strange way, he felt by saving you from the streets  he was also saving himself. 
 He's a damaged man. 
 But he's a good man. 
 And he's your husband. 
 Will you see him?
