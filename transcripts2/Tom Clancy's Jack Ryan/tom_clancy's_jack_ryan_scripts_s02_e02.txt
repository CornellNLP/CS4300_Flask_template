 (TIRES SCREECHING) 
  (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) 
  They got you on a flight out early tomorrow. 
  You'll be back in D. C. by noon. 
  I'm not going. 
  Jack I'm not going till I find out who did this. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Hey. 
  - Mike November. 
  I'm the C. O. S. 
  - Jim Greer. 
  And this is Jack Ryan. 
  Hi. 
  Sorry. 
  Mike? 
  You need to come see this right away. 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  Help me. 
  MIKE: His name is Filiberto JosÃ© Luiz Ramos. 
  He's a captain in the National Police. 
  He was in charge of the security detail that escorted you to the airport. 
  So what is he doing here? 
  MIKE: Says his wife and kids were murdered. 
  They tried to kill him, but he got away. 
  How did he manage that? 
  His dog bit the guy, and he ran. 
  He stole a car and drove straight here. 
  He wants asylum. 
  Doesn't trust the Venezuelan government. 
  - Can't blame him there. 
  - Mike. 
  Asylum for what? 
  He thinks he knows who killed Senator Moreno. 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  Asylum for his mother, too. 
  She's very sick. 
  The assassination. 
  What happened? 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  A man he'd never seen before came to him at the hospital where his mother stays, uh blond hair, blue eyes, spoke very good Spanish - but with an accent. 
  - What kind of accent? 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  - European, maybe. 
  - What else? 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  Blue eyes knew that he was a policeman. 
  He gave him about $3,000, and he told him to turn the senator's convoy at a different exit from the traffic circle. 
  You piece of sh1t. 
  (FILIBERTO SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  He didn't know that anyone was gonna be killed. 
  - He's very sorry. 
  - What the f*ck did you think was gonna happen? 
  (FILIBERTO SHOUTS IN SPANISH) 
  It was a lot of money, - and his mother was very sick. 
  - No, I don't f*cking care. 
  President Reyes. 
  Was his name ever mentioned? 
  - No. 
  No, no, no. 
  (SPEAKS SPANISH) 
  - Reyes. 
  Look at me. 
  Look at me! 
  Ubarri. 
  Ubarri, was his name ever mentioned? 
  - (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  - No, no. 
  Nothing else. 
  That's it. 
  (FILIBERTO SNIFFLES) 
  (VEHICLES PASSING OUTSIDE) 
  (HORN HONKS) 
  (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) 
  You okay? 
  Reyes did this. 
  Okay. 
  You listen to me. 
  What we talked about the other night, the Almeta, the rocket launch in the South China Sea, there's something bigger going on here, Jack. 
  Bigger than Reyes. 
  And we can both help each other. 
  This isn't T-FAD. 
  We do this, we do this together. 
  I can live with that.

  (MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY OVER SPEAKERS) 
  Goddamn. 
  Beautiful day. 
  I'll be by tomorrow to check the seal. 
  - Make sure you don't take her out till I do. 
  - Good stuff. 
  Uh, hey, Marcus, while you're here and geared up and all, you mind scraping the barnacles off the hull? 
  I'll pay you cash. 
  Off the books. 
  Sure. 
  Maybe when I'm done, I can swab the deck and take the trash out for you, too. 
  Hey, I'm just asking. 
  No need to get sensitive, bud. 
  I fix the boats, I don't clean them. 
  Just so we're clear. 
  Well, all right. 
  Sorry, I thought you could use the money, I (KEYS JANGLE) 
  Grams! 
  YVONNE: We're out here. 
  (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
  Old friend came to see you. 
  Bishop. 
  How's it going, man? 
  What are you doing here? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Do you mind if we head inside and chat? 
  It's a little hot out here, and these mosquitoes are eating me alive. 
  Sweet tea, sweet blood, as they say. 
  Excuse us, Mrs. 
  Bishop. 
  Nice meeting you, Mr. Spicoli. 
  Oh, please, call me Jeff. 
  Two Purple Hearts, Bronze Star, Navy Cross. 
  Damn. 
  That's an impressive bunch, your family. 
  Is that your daddy? 
  So, Jeff, something you wanted to talk to me about? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I need a boat driver. 
  Someone with a clean sheet who can discreetly navigate a river system, get in and out of tight spaces in shallow water, do repairs on the fly. 
  Yeah, I-I tell you, I-I've done a ton of amphibious assaults with lots of different skippers. 
  You're the best. 
  Remember Operation Pit Viper? 
  Cambodia? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  What? 
  We rocked that bitch. 
  How's your Spanish? 
  You're wasting your breath. 
  And most importantly, my time. 
  - I'm done with all of that. 
  - Oh, look it, I'm-I'm not here to try and reenlist you. 
  It actually works to my benefit that you're not in. 
  Yeah, how's that? 
  Well, this is a "off the books" kind of job. 
  Yeah, well, thanks, but no, thanks. 
  - I got a life here. 
  - Oh, absolutely. 
  Living with your grandma, fixing the props on rich people's yachts? 
  I'm sure you score a ton of pussy. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Man, get the f*ck out of my house. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Well, I hate to see talent wasted, so I'm gonna give you 24 - to think about it - Just go. 
  And don't bother us anymore. 
  Thanks for the tea, Yvonne! 
  YVONNE: Bye, Jeff! 
  You looked happy. 
  (PHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE) 
  (PHONE RINGING, WATER RUNNING) 
  (WATER STOPS RUNNING) 
  - Hello? 
  - CHAPIN: Jack, it's Mitch Chapin. 
  We're all sick about what happened to Jimmy. 
  How are you holding up? 
  I'm doing my best. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I know you two were close. 
  You get hurt? 
  Nothing major. 
  I'll be fine. 
  Oh, thank God for that at least. 
  Listen, Jack, I know this is probably the last thing you want to think about right now, but there are a lot of people that are going to want to talk to you about what happened down there. 
  I can help walk you through all that. 
  Come see me. 
  Well, I appreciate that, Senator, I-I do. 
  I I'm actually still in Caracas. 
  I thought you would've come home with with Jimmy. 
  Well, there's a few things I just need to follow up on down here. 
  If you need anything, you call me. 
  Any time. 
  Thank you, sir. 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  Uh-huh. 
  Uh-huh. 
  SÃ­. 
  (MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH) 
  (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH NEARBY) 
  JOST: Help you with something, bru? 
  - Yeah, I think I might be lost, actually. 
  - I'd say so. 
  I work for Valencia Coffee. 
  We had a shipment due in today and it never showed, so I thought Show me some f*cking I. 
  D. 
  Yeah. 
  Oh, Jesus f*cking Christ, there you are. 
  You're on the wrong f*cking boat. 
  I gave you the container ISO, right? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah, so how hard can it be? 
  - Let's go. 
  - You're right. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  It's his first week. 
  JOST: Oy! 
  Bitch! 
  I. D. "Oy, bitch"? 
  (BULLET CLATTERS) 
  Stop. 
  What? 
  (PANTING): Enough. 
  Please. 
  You obviously know enough about me, so you know I'm not stupid. 
  Fair enough. 
  Where do you want to begin? 
  I don't know, why don't we try the whole name thing again? 
  Lee Klein. 
  Lee Klein? 
  And how do you know how to do that, Lee? 
  I'm former KSK. 
  Jesus Christ. 
  I'm a private investigator now. 
  A wealthy German businessman has gone missing. 
  The family went to the government, the government wants to keep it quiet. 
  I don't understand why you're following me. 
  The last cable he sent was from the offices of Cinco Palmas. 
  JACK: What kind of business is he in? 
  On his card? 
  Pretty sure it says something like "military consultant". 
  But you and I would say that he sells toys to naughty children. 
  - Reyes? 
  - Yes. 
  - You think Reyes has him? 
  - I know so. 
  How? 'Cause my businessman doesn't always play nice with others. 
  (SEABIRD SQUAWKING) 
  I was sorry to hear about the senator. 
  You think Reyes is behind it. 
  Why the hell would you say that? 
  Well, the ticket on your desk had you flying out today, but yet, here you are. 
  I think we can help each other, Jack. 
  - Help each other how? 
  - When you get Reyes, you give me my businessman. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  And why would I do that? 
  'Cause I'm giving you your first move. 
  - (TAPS KEYBOARD) 
  - This proves Reyes killed Jimmy. 
  He knew we were getting close. 
  How much did this recording cost? 
  Just, uh, sharing whatever intel we get from it. 
  Sharing with who? 
  Where did you get this? 
  It's a confidential source. 
  MIKE: It's a confidential source? 
  I'm the goddamn C. O. S. 
  Yeah, well, I'm not stationed here. 
  Here, let me guess. 
  Five foot five, dark hair, blue jacket. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - The girl at the hotel. 
  - She was working him. 
  - Okay. 
  We're after the same thing. 
  Yeah, I bet you were. 
  MIKE: (CHUCKLES) 
  Who does she work for? 
  BND. 
  - She told you that? 
  - No. 
  But when she showed up out of nowhere on a ship, - I figured I'd give the Berlin office a call. 
  - Jesus, Jack. 
  You slept with a foreign agent and you made a deal with her to trade intel. 
  Well, technically, those are two separate incidents, but yeah. 
  - You trusted a goddamn spy. 
  - The Germans are our allies. 
  Situationally. 
  Listen, this business isn't about trust, it's about intelligence. 
  And she can be an asset. 
  You realize I have an obligation to report this. 
  Mike, she gave this to us so we would have leverage on Ubarri. 
  GREER: And not only that, the BND, they don't want their fingerprints on this. 
  They can't lean on people the way we can. 
  So what, you guys want to take a run at Ubarri with us? 
  I say we use it to create dissension in the ranks. 
  Let's put Ubarri on the chopping block. 
  Uh, recruit him and then get him to flip on Reyes. 
  That's a fair trade. 
  All right. 
  Fine. 
  No more surprises. 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  - You guys married? 
  - Divorced. 
  Single. 
  All right, great talk. 
  What about you? 
  Yeah, divorced, twice. 
  Same woman. 
  Wow. 
  You just didn't learn your lesson the first time, or ? 
  Heart wants what the heart wants. 
  GREER: Who's the lucky lady? 
  Lisa Calabrese. 
  Formerly Lisa November. 
  The ambassador? 
  Yeah. 
  Nice. 
  Right? 
  She's a formidable woman, you know? 
  They're hard to find. 
  Well, that sounds like you're not over her, so why not go for the hat trick? 
  I-I've thought about it. 
  GREER: Well, you know what they say, there's power in threes. 
  (LAUGHTER) 
  MIKE: sh1t. 
  (WHISTLING, CHEERING) 
  (GRUNTS) 
  - Goal! 
  - (CHEERING)

  (CAMERA CLICKS) 
  What the f*ck you do that for? 
  It's always good to have a picture of your buddies from the CIA. 
  - f*ck you. 
  - Now we know he speaks English. 
  Think he knows more than two words? 
  - f*ck you, too. 
  - That's three. 
  Mr. 
  Bastos, you're here because we wanted you to listen to something. 
  We thought, as Reyes's head of security, this information might be valuable to you. 
  (MIKE SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
  - Hi. 
  - Sorry, wrong floor. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - Drink? 
  Yes, please. 
  So, um, did you play the tape for Ubarri? 
  For Bastos actually. 
  Oh, smart. 
  That will put Ubarri's back against the wall. 
  Oh. 
  - Good. 
  Glad you approve. 
  - Thank you. 
 
 
 
  Harry. 
  Your real name's Harriet Baumann, and I would assume that your German businessman is BND, too. 
  Please, for the next few moments, why don't we just tell the truth. 
  His name is Max Schenkel. 
  He disappeared two months ago. 
  BND gave me one chance to find him and bring him back alive. 
  And what's he doing in Caracas? 
  I don't know. 
  Okay, let's keep playing. 
  Why were you surveilling us at the hotel? 
  The recording mentioned Reyes meeting a U. S. senator. 
  I thought something big was going on and maybe our agent - got caught up in it. 
  - Well, that explains why you were targeting me at the bar, but if you knew who I work for, then why would you give me the tape? 
  'Cause I need the CIA's help. 
  Just ask. 
  If I reached out directly and made this a joint operation, then CIA's rules would apply to Max's capture, which means that We could kill him. 
  Yeah. 
  It sounds like this is not someone you want dead. 
  No, I don't. 
  Okay, well, going forward, I suggest we work together to try and bring him in alive. 
  Pretty sure I told you to go away. 
  You did. 
  - So why are you here? 
  - 'Cause I love tacos, man. 
  There's a great place just down the road from you, La Chiquita. 
  Man, if you haven't checked it out, you should. 
  What is that, man? 
  Why don't you open it up and find out. 
  That's 15 grand. 
  You get another 15 when the job's done. 
  I told you I wasn't interested. 
  All right. 
  I can make it 40, 20 and 20. 
  But that's as high as I'm gonna go. 
  Take it or leave it. 
  You washed out of BUD/S, and you finished out your career as a dirty boat driver. 
  So you didn't become a SEAL. 
  Big f*cking whoop. 
  90% of the people who give it a shot fail. 
  But there is a world of difference between getting shot at, blown up, and doing flutter kicks on the beach while some jackass with a fucked-up haircut screams at you. 
  I have seen you handle yourself under pressure, Marcus. 
  And when people needed you in order to survive, you showed up. 
  So from where I'm sitting, you have a lot more in common with your daddy than you may think. 
  Plane leaves at 0600. 
  MacDill. 
  X-Ray Hangar. 
  And I'm not asking you a third goddamn time. 
  See you around, Bishop. 
  - How's your hand? 
  - It's fine. 
  Look, I don't know why Reyes requested this meeting, but it is gonna go smoothly. 
  We're already sitting on a powder keg, so neither you, nor you are gonna f*ck this up. 
  Formidable. 
  Mr. President, this is Dr. 
  Jack Ryan, whom you met, and this is Mr. Greer. 
  Are you with the State Department, too? 
  Sure am. 
  I'm his boss. 
  You'll have to excuse me, but it's my daughter's quinceaÃ±era today. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - LISA: Big day. 
  - Yes, it is, indeed. 
  Please, have a seat. 
  I'm very sorry you lost your senator and your friend. 
  However I have some news today that I hope you will appreciate. 
  I have made it my top priority to bring those responsible to justice, and we have. 
  The murderers were part of a radical group called Fuerzas Armadas de LiberaciÃ³n. 
  Leftist radicals long opposed to the United States. 
  So, two days ago, they took matters into their own hands. 
  But yesterday, our forces raided their camp, and we found the police uniforms and the explosives they used for their attack. 
  Four of them were killed in the raid, and the other two confessed, and they will spend the rest of their lives in a Venezuelan prison. 
  As a gesture of respect, I wanted to share the news with you first. 
  And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to attend my daughter's party. 
  LISA: Mr. President. 
  Mrs. Ambassador. 
  SeÃ±or. 
  Dr. Ryan I am very sorry for your loss. 
  I know you and Jimmy were very close. 
  I know you killed him. 
  Again, my condolences. 
  (GROANING) 
  (LIVELY CHATTER IN SPANISH) 
  (CHEERING) 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  Okay, I got to know. 
  - What? 
  - What'd you say to Reyes? 
  - I told him I know he killed Jimmy. 
  - No, seriously. 
  - (PHONE RINGING) 
  - Seriously. 
  Mike. 
  Hey, sorry I missed your call. 
  What's up? 
  Yeah, listen. 
  Filiberto, he said the man who killed his family was bit by a dog, right? 
  Yeah. 
  So? 
  JACK: Which arm was it? 
  Hang on. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Left. 
  Why? 
  All right, listen, I just came from the palace, and I saw Mateo Bastos. 
  He had an injury on his left arm. 
  Show Filiberto his picture, and call me back. 
  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
  (LOCK BUZZES) 
  Talk to Filiberto. 
  sh1t. 
  Give me the goddamn key! 
  (WATER RUNNING) 
  When's the last time you checked on him? 
  sh1t. 
  Get a doctor. 
  Go! 
  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
  (GRUNTING, GASPING) 
  (GRUNTING) 
  (CRIES OUT) 
  What the f*ck? 
  (STRAINING) 
  (GRUNTS) 
  (SCREAMING) 
  - Greer! 
  - Ryan?! 
  - Ryan! 
  - I'm okay. 
  Go! 
  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
  (GRUNTS) 
  (EXCITED CHATTER) 
  Move! 
  sh1t. 
  Move! 
  Whoa. 
  (WHEEZING) 
  (GROANING) 
  You hit? 
  - Look at me. 
  Where are you hit? 
  - No, I'm fine. 
  - Where were you hit? 
  - No, get off me. 
  Get the f*ck off me! 
  What happened? 
  He got away. 
  Did he get into a car? 
  Where'd he go? 
  I didn't see anything. 
  He got away! 
  Listen, man, are you all right? 
  I'm f*cking peachy. 
  (RAPID KNOCKING) 
  (KNOCKING CONTINUES) 
  I tried calling. 
  Are you okay? 
  Do you recognize him? 
  Is this Max? 
  Is it Max? 
  Yes. 
  All right, last chance. 
  Tell me the truth. 
  The truth. 
  Okay. 
  I was in boarding school in England when I met Max. 
  I was 17. 
  Max brought me into KSK. 
  After that. 
  We were running an operation in Afghanistan. 
  Mistakes were made. 
  My mistakes. 
  A lot of people died that shouldn't have. 
  Max took all the blame. 
  He protected me. 
  The higher-ups forced him out, and we were both offered a soft place to land at BND. 
  And then he left. 
  And why'd he do that? 
  He didn't just go f*cking missing, did he? 
  Why did he leave, Harry? 
  I know what he's doing now is bad, but I can't forget what he did for me back then. 
  He kills people for money. 
  But you knew that. 
  Didn't you? 
  Because Jimmy's murder had Max's fingerprints all over it, didn't it? 
  And you knew. 
  And you said nothing. 
  Now my friend is dead. 
  Do you know where Max is right now? 
  Do you know where he is? 
  (QUIETLY): I don't know. 
  I have no reason to believe you. 
  And even less reason to trust you. 
  Jack. 
  Jack
