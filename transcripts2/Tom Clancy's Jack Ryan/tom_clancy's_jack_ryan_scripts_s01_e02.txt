 Oh, f*ck. There is nothing about this that is good.    
 The foreign press are reporting that the base was overrun by a local militia.    
 As far as our footprint is concerned, we were never there.    
 What about our casualties?    
 Three Americans. One SOG, two JSOC.    
 Why don't we address the real reason for this brief... him?    
 SINGER: Based on biometrics,    
 DS&T have concluded with a high degree of certainty that the person we once had detained was this man.    
 His nom de guerre is "Suleiman al Bekaa."    
 We're still trying to track down his given name.    
 He appears in a few more videos like this.    
 Propaganda pieces. He never speaks.    
 We don't have an I.D. on this guy, the one playing possum.    
 Younger, deferential to Suleiman.    
 Definitely has his trust.    
 This Suleiman is ISIS?    
 We believe so, sir.    
 He's not ISIS.    
 Stand up.    
 That is to say, he may have been, but... if he was, he's not anymore.    
 SINGER: You may recognize Dr. Ryan from this evening's installment of "jihadi theater."    
 He and Jim Greer were on the ground in Yemen when the base was attacked.    
 Tell me, Dr. Ryan, how is it you know so much about this guy, and we're hearing about him for the first time?    
 I was just following the money, sir.    
 Groups like ISIS... They make most of their money from smuggling or seized oil reserves in Iraq and Syria.    
 They move that money through hawala networks.    
 It's all done analog, meaning the money's literally handed from one person to another.    
 The account we froze was from a European bank.    
 I mean, it was funded by multiple transfers from phony LLCs.    
 The money's been washed so many times, there's no way we could locate just one source.    
 - Meaning what? 
- GREER: Meaning these assholes have their sh1t wired extremely tight.    
 Now look, we all know part of ISIS's M.O. is attention.    
 If they did this, why haven't they claimed it?    
 That's not proof, Jim.    
 When he came to me with this Suleiman, I was skeptical, too.    
 Not anymore.    
 I've seen firsthand, the men that hit this site were coordinated, well-trained. They knew exactly where they were going and what their objective was. They even carried away their dead so we couldn't I.D. 'em.    
 Sue, I'd like to stand up a task force.    
 Who do you have in mind?    
 Well, given the origin of his financing, I think...    
 CTC Europe, uh, should head this.    
 [MURMURING]    
 Nate, we found this guy. 
This should go to T-FAD.    
 T-FAD will still follow the money.    
 And whatever you find, you'll share with CTC Europe.    
 I'm sure they could use the help.    
 The president's flying back from Camp David.    
 I need options to put in front of him by morning.    
 You'll have them.    
 Any questions? All right, go to work.

 [GASPS]     
 I see they fused your L  to L  vertebrae together.     
 Given the extent of your prior surgeries, I'd say you got off pretty lucky.     
 Some inflammation of the scar tissue around your thecal sac, and a moderate lumbar sprain.     
 I can prescribe some hydrocodone with ibuprofen     
 - for the pain. 
- Oh, no.     
 That's okay. No-no pills.     
 Well, ice will help with the inflammation, and when the pain subsides, I'd suggest doing some core strengthening. Maybe try yoga.     
 - Yeah, I'll do that. 
- Any questions for me?     
 Where's Epidemiology?     
 Let's obtain simultaneous blood cultures from the left and right antecubital fossa.     
 - You got it, Dr. Mueller. 
- Thank you.     
 Hey.     
 - Hey. 
- [LAUGHS]     
 - What are you doing here? 
- Oh, I just had an appointment downstairs, and then I remembered you said this is where you worked, so I figured I'd come by and say hey.     
 - Hey. 
- Hey.     
 [LAUGHS] Um...     
 Are you okay?     
 Yeah. Just, I tweaked my back a little bit.     
 Listen, I'm really sorry we didn't get more of a chance     
 - to talk at your dad's birthday party. 
- Yeah, that was, uh...     
 That was quite some exit you made.     
 Huh.     
 What was the big emergency?     
 Oh, that was a... contaminated shipment of romaine lettuce left out on a Navy dock in Bethesda.     
 It was an E. coli scare, so...     
 - Pretty exciting stuff, actually. 
- I didn't know the Coast Guard picked people up for bad lettuce.     
 Well, you know, their motto is, uh, semper paratus.     
 - "Always..." 
- Ready?     
 - Wow. 
- Med school. Lots of Latin.     
 [LAUGHS] Marines... Lots of mottos.     
 Hey, listen, I, um...     
 I really am sorry. I...     
 Apology accepted.     
 - That was easy. 
- Yeah. [LAUGHS]     
 Marina, can you let Dr. Rumack know that I, uh, catalogued these blood cultures this morning?     
 - Sure. 
- Thanks.     
 So do you get a coffee break soon, or...?     
 Uh, my shift just started.     
 Oh. What about dinner?     
 Or give you a call?     
 - I asked my dad about you. 
- Oh.     
 He said you're one of the smartest guys he's ever met.     
 - Oh. 
- But you're too good for your own good.     
 Is that even a thing? 
What does that mean?     
 Uh, moralistic, self-righteous.

 Amazing, Noreen. I owe you one.     
 Great, because, uh...     
 [QUIETLY]: I need some advice.     
 Ask him out.     
 Who?     
 The targeter from "pad" that you time your exit to every night so you can ride the elevator together.     
 Actually, I was talking about Eisenberg's fantasy league.     
 Oh. All right, what do we got?     
 Okay, Zack Greinke or Dallas Keuchel?     
 Come on. Greinke's ERA is half a point lower.     
 But SunTrust Stadium gives up  .   more home runs per three-game home stand than Minute Maid.

 Suleiman's cell phone.     
 He left it in Yemen.     
 CCI had their eggheads trying to crack it.     
 You stole it?     
 No, I-I borrowed it.     
 Sometimes you have to break a few rules just to get the job done.     
 Now, that bad boy has got full disk encryption     
 - and an eight-digit passcode. 
- Great.     
 Do you know what that means? That means it would've taken their cluster  ,    hours to crack it.     
 Because they're up there running algorithms and doing geometry.     
 - Algebra. 
- What?     
 Algorithms are algebra.     
 Whatever. My point is, people don't randomly pick passwords, not even terrorist masterminds.     
 They pick something personal.     
 A kid's birthday, their anniversary.     
 And you know more about this Suleiman asshole than anybody in the building.

 So, uh, how would you find him?     
 Suleiman.     
 We got to figure out a way to get inside his head.     
 We need to see what it is that's motivating him.     
 What motivates him? Same thing motivates all of 'em: death to the West, a new caliphate.     
 Yeah. Normally, I would agree with you.     
 But... I don't know, it's interesting.     
 There's something different about his agenda.     
 Meaning?     
 Everything he's doing, it just feels more specific, more calculated.     
 Look at the way he collected money.     
 It's... sophisticated.     
 He's like bin Laden.     
 To be, uh, clear, I gave CTC Europe the lead on this, but I need people like you.     
 You've shown, um, great initiative.     
 Well, thank you, sir, but, uh, with all due respect, that was Greer who put the surveillance team on the bank.

- Can I, uh, give you some advice, Jack?     
 You know, I've known Jim Greer a long time.     
 He's an excellent case officer, but, you know, his, uh, talents don't translate well to headquarters.     
 Yeah. You, on the other hand, I could see you, uh, being the, uh, in-house point person for the Suleiman task force and working directly with me.     
 And an op like this, uh, it's a career-maker.
