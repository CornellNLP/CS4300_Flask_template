 Tough loss for your O's last night.    
 Could be worse, Harold.    
 Could be a Mets fan.    
 LAYLA: So let's make sure we get them in by Thursday.    
 Are we on Yemeni time this morning, Dr. Ryan?    
 No, ma'am.    
 Okay, let's get started.    
 So last night we got some fresh Houthi SIGINT from the Fort.    
 You'll find the serial link in the morning e-mail.    
 CTC Europe wants to see a list of all SWIFT transactions out of Islamabad.    
 That's you, Patrick.

 Yes.    
 Yes, sir.    
 You can go in now.    
 Mmm, Jim.

 Have a seat.    
 [BOTH GRUNT]    
 So how was your leave?    
 GREER: Long.    
 I took a boat out to Nags Head. Did some fishing.    
 - Yeah. 
- Yeah.    
 Sounds calming.    
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Hmm.    
 How's Jasmine?    
 I wouldn't know.    
 I've only seen her once at her lawyer's.    
 Oh, sorry. Y-You still have a ring on.    
 I thought maybe the two of you were trying to work it out.    
 Hmm.    
 This is the, uh, this is the read book    
 that the outgoing chief    
 T-FAD had them make for you.    
 The group is mostly analysts, a couple of case officers.    
 Uh, you know, you'll have reps from, uh, Treasury and Justice, uh...    
 No one you'd know.    
 [SIGHS]    
 Uh, you know, Jim, it is what you make of it.    
 It's a backwater post, Nate.    
 And we both know it.    
 It's a second chance. And one, frankly, that not a lot of people on this floor felt you deserved.    
 Mmm.    
 Now...    
 [SIGHS]    
 Oh, and-and Jim?    
 You know, just so we're clear.    
 I went to bat for you.    
 Don't f*ck me on this.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 And Al Arabiya has a special this week on the conflict, which might be     
 - worth checking out. 
- Where can we get that from?     
 - LAYLA: OSC should have it up online, and... 
- Morning.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 I'm James Greer.     
 I'm your new group chief.     
 Oh, sh1t.     
 He was chief of station in Karachi.     
 GREER: Why don't we go around the table, just stand up, introduce yourselves, and tell me what you're working on.     
 Let's start with you.     
 Aye, sir. I'm Tarek Kassar.     
 I work PAD.     
 Currently, I'm tracking SIGINT in the region, trying to get coverage on the hawala networks     
 - out of Islamabad. 
- Very well.     
 Noreen Yang. I work Europe.     
 Uh, we just completed our second round of analysis on SWIFT transactions based on liaison data from French and Belgian assets, sir.     
 Your turn, Lance Armstrong.     
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
Uh, Jack Ryan. I work Yemen.     
 I've been monitoring SWIFT network transactions in and around Aden.     
 And...?     
 JACK: And...     
 Um...     
 Well, actually, in the last few months,     
 I have red-flagged several of these transactions as potentially suspicious.     
 GREER: Suspicious?     
 How so?     
 It's anomalous to see large, one-off SWIFT transactions to individuals, especially in Yemen.     
 And normal SWIFT transactions usually occur in patterns.     
 What's your concern?     
 What's at issue?     
 - [MOUTHS] 
- JACK: Um, it is my theory that the individual behind these transactions could be a high-level target.     
 Hmm.     
 Which one?     
 Well, now, that I'm not... [CHUCKLES]     
 - necessarily clear... 
- Who is he?     
 I believe his name is Suleiman.     
 It means "man of peace."     
 He just popped up on CTC Yemen's radar.     
 The RH assets have mentioned him as well,     
 - so... 
- That's it?     
 They heard a name.     
 What else have they said?     
 It's not about what they're saying, sir, it's about how they're saying it.     
 I mean, they're talking about this guy with real reverence, and I'm not talking sectarianism. I mean, he appeals to Shia and Sunni.     
 Wow.     
 A brand-new bin Laden on my first day.     
 Who would have thunk it?     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 So how come you're the only one that knows about this mystery man?     
 Well, one of the difficulties in cobbling together intel is dealing with two databases     
 - that aren't meant to talk to one another. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 That's why I've actually written a custom SQL query...     
 Next.     
 Uh... hi.     
 I'm Patrick. I cover Syria.     
 [ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES]     
 PATRICK: SQL query. Seriously?     
 You went there, Ryan?     
 TAREK: Ops guys like maps and graphics.     
 You should try putting stick figures in your reports next time.     
 Anyone know why he got PNG'd back to headquarters?     
 I heard he went all Colonel Kurtz in the desert, started making S.A.D. dip their bullets in pigs' blood so anyone they killed wouldn't go to Paradise.

 Hold on one second. Thank you.     
 Sir, do you have a minute?     
 For you, Bright Boy, I got five.     
 Come in.     
 What have you got?     
 I found something you got to see.     
 What am I looking at?     
 These are financial transactions through an app called TracEuro.     
 You use your cell phone.     
 Yeah, they were using that in Karachi before I left.     
 Every one of these transactions is linked to this account opened a week and a half ago in a bank in Aden by a Saudi import-export company, but...     
 the business license of that company is less than a month old.     
 This is a shell.     
 - Okay. 
- So, six SWIFT transactions have come through in the last eight days.     
 They total over $  million.     
 Of all the other accounts that I've been monitoring, only two have ever gone above six figures, and barely.     
 Large transactions attract attention.     
 Why go big now and risk popping up on our radar?     
 Maybe he doesn't even care about drawing attention, because whatever he's planning, he's ready now.     
 - This is it. We got him. 
- "He"?     
 You mean Suleiman.     
 Sir, he's real.     
 I promise you he is real.     
 Don't you think there are people on the seventh floor that would have loved this opportunity    years ago the first time they heard the name "bin Laden"?

 Ryan. My office. Now.     
 Shut the door.     
 I told you to stand the f*ck down, and you went behind my back     
 - and froze that account. 
- That was Treasury's call.     
 Oh, bullshit!     
 The ink on that demarche may be theirs, but this was your idea.     
 Listen, if you're worried about this blowing back on you, don't.     
 Okay? I'll take full responsibility.     
 Oh. Is that what you think?     
 That I'm trying to protect my career? Look around.     
 That ship has sailed.     
 And let me ask you something.     
 You've been doing this for how long?     
 Almost four years.     
 Oh, "almost four years."     
 Holy sh1t. [CHUCKLES]     
 That's, like... Wow.     
 I am impressed.     
 Now, let's say that you're actually right and Suleiman or Casper the Friendly Ghost or whoever the f*ck actually exists.     
 What do you think he does when he finds out a state entity has frozen his bank account?     
 He cuts bait and you get nothing!     
 How many people you know walk away from $  million?

 - What the hell's going on? 
- That account you froze...     
 S.A.D. and Yemeni PSO picked up somebody.     
 Suleiman?     
 No. A couple of couriers, they think.     
 Wait, you said S.A.D.,     
 - but I didn't order any surveillance. 
- I did.     
 I thought you said I wasn't "there yet."     
 You weren't. But that doesn't mean you were wrong.     
 Well, how come you couldn't have said that, instead of throwing me out of your office?     
 Because I don't know you.     
 And I don't answer to you.     
 Now, S.A.D. and the Yemenis 
are gonna run the interrogation.     
 But you're the one that knows all this financial sh1t, so I need you there to make sure they know what questions to ask.     
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.     
 What? N-No.     
 You... I can't go to Yemen.     
 Why not?     
 I'm an analyst.     
 I don't interrogate people, I write reports.
