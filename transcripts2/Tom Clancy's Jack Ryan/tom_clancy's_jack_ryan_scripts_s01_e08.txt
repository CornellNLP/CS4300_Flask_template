 He'd take your picture.    
 And then he'd charge you ten bucks for it.    
 Not a bad racket, actually.    
 He died in the crash.    
 We were, uh, extracting this family.    
 They had been marked as collaborators by the Taliban so they would've been killed immediately if we hadn't relocated them and... and Sahim just kept begging me to take him with us.    
 He was an orphan, so... he just said he wanted to go someplace safe, someplace away from all this sh1t and... at least that's what he said.

 Dr. Roger Wade from NEST,    
 Nuclear Emergency Support Team.     
 I'll let him brief you.     
 Early this morning, a Maryland dock worker checked himself into the ER.     
 He was suffering from acute radiation poisoning.     
 Cesium-    is the same isotope that caused the disaster at Chernobyl.     
 We traced the contamination back to a cargo container at the Port of Baltimore.     
 KALIE: We went back through all the video, which is how we found these two.     
 Wait, I thought DHS checked every container coming into the States for radiation.     
 Yeah, but cesium-   's almost impossible to trace.     
 From Baltimore, he would be just a few hours drive from every major city on the Eastern seaboard.     
 KALIE: We're coordinating with the Boston and Manhattan field offices, looking for potential targets.     
 In terms of casualties, what are we talking about here?     
 Depending on how much nuclear material was used, you could be looking at a nuclear fallout that could last for   years and kill thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands.

 Anybody know if the Nats are in town?     
 NOREEN: Nats are at home, O's are on the road.     
 This is the cargo manifest they used from the container to ship the cesium.     
 The only thing touched was one three-by-five-foot container of olive oil, some of its contents were removed.     
 JACK: Wait a minute.     
 How much cesium would you need to have the fallout you're talking about?

 Doesn't that look small to you?

 GREER: What do you mean?     
 In Paris, Suleiman killed that priest, but he used the death to get everyone into the church, and that's when he attacked.     
 It was a multi-step process.
