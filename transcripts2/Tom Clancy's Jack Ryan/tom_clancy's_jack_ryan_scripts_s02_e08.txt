 sh1t. 
  Let's go. 
  Yo. 
  Get up. 
  Come on. 
  You okay? 
  You're all right. 
  You all right? 
  Okay? 
  Any news on your man? 
  Guards said they took him to the palace. 
  All right, then. 
  You paid us to liberate the camp; camp's liberated. 
  This is where we part ways. 
  Wait a minute. 
  I can get you more money. 
  Got plenty. 
  Besides, what good is it if you're too dead to spend it? 
  Good luck to you, pal.

  Let's get out of this noise. 
  You gotta love countries that still put sh1t down on paper. 
  I got everything. 
  Vogler Industries is owned by two shell companies: Northlake Allied, and Cinco Palmas. 
  Guess who filed the paperwork for the LLC for Cinco Palmas. 
  Monica Herrera. 
  Look who's the signatory. 
  Wait, so who's Northlake Allied? 
  Some law firm in Philadelphia filed the paperwork. 
  Philadelphia. 
  On Thorne's computer, there was a number from Philadelphia that called him at least half a dozen times the day before Moreno was murdered. 
  - So what? 
  - Max said there was someone else. 
  Jack, we got him. 
  Cinco Palmas is Reyes. 
  We're done. 
  Pack it up, we're out of here, man. 
  Wait. 
  You mean after we get Greer. 
  When the election's over, Lisa will negotiate Greer's release. 
  Mike I'm not leaving without him. 
  We are getting these refugees out of here. 
  This is State Department's purview now. 
  Pack this sh1t up. 
  Bird leaves in ten. 
  Mr. 
  Greer, I'm very sorry the way you were treated. 
  It is unfortunate. 
  Unnecessary. 
  Why am I here? 
  You are an American spy. 
  So you will be very helpful. 
  Enjoy your meal, Mr. 
  Greer. 
  Hello? 
  It's me. 
  Jack. 
  How are you? 
  I'm okay. 
  How are you? 
  I'm good. 
  That's good. 
  Um, listen, I need you to do something for me. 
  Name it. 
  I need Thorne's phone. 
  MI5 has it. 
  So how long will it take? 
  Give me two days. 
  Thank you. 
  Bye, Jack. 
  What's this? 
  Floor plans to the palace. 
  My guess is they got Greer on level one. 
  Look at this sh1t, man. 
  I'm in. 
  You already ruined my career, so what the f*ck? 
  Radio the Peralta! 
  Tell 'em we're taking a detour! 
  Presidential palace! 
  We're going to get Greer! 
  Gear up! 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Footage of a secret prison camp in Venezuela has been released. 
  Sources within the U. S. State Department have verified its accuracy. 
  We have breaking news to report out of Venezuela. 
  Mama Hey! 
  We do not want to be in there when they breach the gates! 
  We get in there, we get Greer, and we get the f*ck out. 
  You got it? 
  Hey! 
  Go! 
  - Clear. 
  - Clear. 
  On me. 
  Get up! 
  Jack as much as you want to take Reyes out, we don't have the authority. 
  Do you understand? 
  Mike! 
  - Man down! 
  - Cover him! 
  - Go! 
  - It's a clean exit wound in and out. 
  Get him to the roof. 
  - sh1t. 
  - Move! 
  Oh. 
  You are f*cked in the head. 
  You know that? 
  Yeah, it's good to see you, too. 
  You should've left me behind. 
  Don't worry. 
  There's still time for that. 
  Get down! 
  That's for Matice. 
  Can we go now? 
  What we know right now at this time is it appears to be a group deep in the jungle. 
  Wait. 
  Where's Ryan? 
  Ryan! 
  - Son of a bitch. 
  - You're surprised? 
  - I'll go back for him. 
  - I got it. 
  I know where he went. 
  You get to the roof. 
  You hear that? 
  That's what your country thinks of you now. 
  You're finished. 
  Go ahead. 
  Assassinate the leader of a sovereign nation, and you'll see what happens to you. 
  Shut up. 
  Shut up. 
  Jack? 
  Let him go. 
  No f*cking way. 
  I told you we don't have the authority. 
  It is that f*cking simple. 
  Let him go. 
  - I told you. 
  - I said shut the f*ck up. 
  Jack Then we take him with us. 
  - We're not. 
  - He has to stand trial. 
  And he will. 
  Okay? 
  Just not by us. 
  He's got to pay for what he did! 
  Just let him go, man. 
  At least you have one smart friend left. 
  f*ck you! 
  Let's go. 
  This wasn't the best vacation. 
  Come on, dude. 
  You're milking this for all it's worth! 
  Uh-huh? 
  Bonalde! 
  Bonalde! 
  Bonalde! 
  Bonalde! 
  Bonalde Gracias! 
  Viva Venezuela! 
  You're not hungry? 
  I had enough chow on boats like this to last a lifetime. 
  Really? 
  I kind of missed it. 
  So what happens now? 
  I'm gonna drink my coffee, take a hot shower, and sleep. 
  I think you know that's not what I meant. 
  I used to sit across the table from an asset, and I swear to God I could hear their heart beat. 
  I knew when they were gonna sweat five minutes before they did. 
  That's how it has to be in the field, you know? 
  That's what it takes to be great. 
  So, you'll have your procedure. 
  You could be great again. 
 
 
 
  No. 
  I can't. 
  Not anymore. 
  It's been a hell of a run, but it's over. 
  Time to move on. 
  Move on? 
  To what? 
  When you turned me down for Moscow - Oh, boy. 
  - you know, I was surprised. 
  This again. 
  Post of a lifetime, only the best can do it. 
  You would've fit right in. 
  But you took an office job. 
  The work we were doing was important. 
  Fair enough, but it's also a job that any other person can do, has done, for every other U. S. senator. 
  - It wasn't singular. 
  - Wow. 
  Then I realized why you did it. 
  Really? 
  Can't wait to hear this. 
  When you work behind a desk, your friends don't get killed. 
  They don't get captured. 
  They don't go down in helicopters. 
  But it's the work, it's the real work that still needs to get done. 
  And if I can't do it, someone else has to. 
  It's time. 
  Sergio, can I borrow you for a minute? 
  I'm gonna get so much sh1t for this. 
  Probably get reassigned to Djibouti. 
  You'll like Djibouti. 
  It's known for its beaches. 
  At least I won't have to deal with you two assholes anymore. 
  See you below deck. 
  We need to add language that caps the appropriation and include the data set we got from the CBO. 
  And will you talk to Maggie about her amendments? 
  Senator. 
  Jack? 
  I thought our debrief was in the morning? 
  Yeah, I got in early. 
  I was wondering if we could talk. 
  Yeah, sure. 
  Can you wait for me here? 
  Take a walk? 
  Sounds like you had quite an adventure down there. 
  Yeah, I guess you could say that. 
  You all right? 
  I'll be fine. 
  I was afraid we were gonna lose you. 
  Yeah, well, we took some big swings. 
  Yeah, you hit some big targets. 
  Hey, you know what I'd really like? 
  If you could arrange a personal introduction to Gloria Bonalde. 
  I'd really like to be able to reach out to her directly during this transition. 
  Well, I'm sure something will be arranged, sir. 
  What's on your mind, son? 
  Well, sir, I think I missed something. 
  I'm gonna need your help. 
  Well, why don't you walk me through it? 
  I think I mentioned Cinco Palmas? 
  The shell company, yeah. 
  You mentioned something about it on the phone. 
  Well, that's how we got Reyes. 
  Cinco Palmas was using Vogler, the mining company, as a front, to bring in the drilling equipment, to hire the local manpower. 
  Basically, anything they didn't want to be directly tied to. 
  Reyes owned Cinco Palmas? 
  Well, that's the problem. 
  He only owned half. 
  The other half was owned by this company out of Philadelphia, Northlake Allied, but they were too well-hidden, too well-papered. 
  They had some good lawyers because I couldn't find anything. 
  The only thing I could find was a Philadelphia phone number from Rupert Thorne's cell phone. 
  That was your one big mistake, Senator. 
  When I called to arrange travel to London, you shouldn't have called Thorne. 
  Let me explain something to you, Jack. 
  You're a smart guy. 
  China controls 90-plus percent of the world's tantalum. 
  So when we found that deposit in Venezuela, I did what was right for the country. 
  What are the consequences of-of China controlling all of something that we need to produce any tech product going forward? 
  Is that how you're gonna justify murder? 
  Let me be crystal clear here, I didn't kill anyone. 
  You might as well have because you paid for it. 
  You arranged for it. 
  Jimmy was my friend, too. 
  So I'm going to ignore your emotions here. 
  You need to look at the bigger picture. 
  Reyes was a valuable f*cking asset, but he's dead. 
  Now you have relationships down there. 
  You can help us move forward. 
  And if you do, I can help you. 
  You want to run for Congress? 
  The man who killed Suleiman? 
  The man who helped save democracy in Venezuela? 
  I make that public and it's done. 
  Think, Jack. 
  There's a lot at stake here. 
  What are you doing? 
  Respectfully declining. 
  Jack. 
  Jack. 
  Senator Chapin, I'm Agent Wolff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
  We'd like to ask you some questions, sir. 
  We have a warrant.
