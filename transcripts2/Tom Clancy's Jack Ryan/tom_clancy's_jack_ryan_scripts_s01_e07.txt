 Ryan, why would the president risk American lives when he doesn't have to?     
 (SIGHS)     
 An air strike may very well kill Suleiman, but you will not neutralize the threat to the United States and to its allies.     
 This is an international organization.     
 They have cells in France,     
 Yemen, Syria, and those are just the ones we know about.     
 Sir, you drop a bomb, and we lose all vital intelligence on his larger operations, not to mention the plans that he's already put into action.     
 I believe Dr. Ryan has made his position very clear.     
 A ground assault is off the table.     
 You want an air strike, Marcus?     
 Get me confirmation that Suleiman is at the compound.

 I don't know, the North Pole?     
 Liberia.     
 I ran a manual check on every flight arriving in Azerbaijan that day.     
 One private plane chartered out of Roberts Airport in Liberia listed two French nationals bringing home the remains of a relative to be buried.     
 They took a body from Liberia to Azerbaijan?     
 Holy sh1t.     
 USAMRIID asked CTC Africa to send a rep to an emergency brief, discussing an Ebola-infected corpse that went missing from Liberia.

 Dr. Mueller, we believe that the body you reported missing was stolen by these two men and flown by private plane to Azerbaijan.     
 - Azerbaijan? 
- GREER: The Caucasus region is notorious for its Soviet scientist defectors.     
 They set themselves up at universities with research grants, and they use the labs for black biology, creating bioweapons to be sold on the black market.     
 Doctor, what we're asking is, is it possible that these two men found a way to weaponize Ebola?     
 Uh... well, EVD-  , like all Ebola strains, is transmitted directly through bodily fluids.     
 Th-The most challenging issue would be the delivery system.     
 - The delivery 
system? -Y-Yes.     
 The means of carrying the widespread infection.     
 Oxygen kills the virus, so transmitting it through the air would be difficult.
