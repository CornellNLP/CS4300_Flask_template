 He's still waiting for him to come home.     
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 Hello, sir.     
 How much to get to the border?     
 Three of those.     
 (SPEAKING ARABIC)     
 (SPEAKS SPANISH)     
 Where'd this guy come from?     
 What do you got?     
 Silver Nissan.     
 Never seen it in this area before.     
 Well, that's too fancy to be local.     
 Right.     
 Let's go.     
 But we didn't get our food!     
 Okay. I'm gonna get him.     
 Who is he looking for?     
 Gonna drop his picture into Mirc Chat.     
 See what I can get.     
 RIOT GRRL: Copy that.     
 We don't go there.     
 Our lives are in danger.     
 I have to get to the border!     
 I beg you.     
 No, I can't.     
 I have to get to the border...     
 Yazid and Fathi are here.     
 Let's go!     
 Come on, let's go!     
 (HORNS BLARING)     
 RIOT GRRL: What the hell is he doing?     
 VICTOR: Got something.     
 Abbas Al-Fathi.     
 He's POI, but he's surveillance only.     
 (CAR HORN HONKING, PEOPLE SCREAMING)     
 RIOT GRRL: This ain't good.     
 Sir, we got a situation over here.     
 Tombstone, what's up?     
 (SCOFFS) Look at this sh1t.     
 (CAR HORN HONKING, PEOPLE SCREAMING)     
 (YELLING IN ARABIC)     
 Leave them alone!     
 Come here, don't be afraid.     
 Go, run!     
 RIOT GRRL: God damn.     
 WHITMORE: Are they in the target deck?     
 One is POI, but he's surveil only.     
 Okay, well, there you have it.     
 - There's nothing you can do. 
- RIOT GRRL: Seriously?     
 We're just gonna watch these girls get robbed or raped or worse?     
 You could run this up the chain of command before you shoot me down.     
 Okay.     
 They're gonna say the same thing.     
 Tie her up!     
 Take it easy!     
 Sara!     
 Hanin, calm down!     
 Mama!     
 Calm down. Easy, easy.     
 Shh.     
 (GIRLS CRYING)     
 Don't move!     
 Did you forget? We're family...     
 You know what they'll do to me...     
 I know. Give me time.     
 I have to figure out how to get rid of this dog.     
 Kill him.     
 And tell my husband that I did it.     
 (SARA SCREAMS)     
 The f*ck?     
 You were saying?     
 - (WAILING) 
- Mama!     
 Yeah, this is Captain Whitmore over at Creech.     
 WE HAVE A POI: Abbas Al-Fathi.     
 He just got shot by an unknown military-aged male.     
 Looks like he's now about to rape a female villager.     
 Request permission to engage.     
 (CRYING)     
 (WAILING)     
 Help me, help me!     
 Someone help!     
 RIOT GRRL: Come on, come on.     
 We got to do something.     
 Someone help me!     
 Sir, I've got a shot.     
 Stand down. Stand down.     
 You do not have authorization to take that shot.     
 Do you hear me?!     
 Acknowledge my f*cking order.     
 (WAILS)     
 WHITMORE: Boy, you just disobeyed a direct order and you broke the rules of engagement.     
 Tombstone, you are relieved of your post.     
 - Get me an MP. 
- Yes, sir.     
 - Yes, sir, I'm here. 
- Need security over here.     
 I see. Yes, sir.     
 Okay.     
 Copy that, sir.     
 You are f*cking lucky.     
 Let's go.     
 (CRYING)     
 See?     
 I told you...     
 God would protect us.     
 (ENGINE STARTS)     
 God damn.     
 That was, like...     
 - God damn. 
- (LAUGHS)     
 sh1t.     
 Go ahead.     
 You earned it.
