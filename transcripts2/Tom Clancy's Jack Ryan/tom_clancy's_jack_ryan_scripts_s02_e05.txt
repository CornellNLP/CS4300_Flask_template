  So, who is he? 
  His real identity. 
  He's a German BND officer. 
  His name is Max Schenkel. 
  He's a German citizen, and he kills people for money. 
  JEREMY: And how long have you and Harry - been working together? 
  - We met in Caracas. 
  - When? 
  - A week ago. 
  I've known Dr. 
  Ryan for about three and a half years. 
  We've done a few interagency operations like this. 
  JEREMY: And what else is she not telling us? 
  I ask myself that every day. 
  Let's go. 
  Come on. 
  I'm gonna need your weapon. 
  What? 
  The shooter's still out there. 
  No, you're done. 
  She's on the next plane to Germany. 
  We can take it from here. 
  Word of advice, Jack. 
  You steer clear of her. 
  You might think she's on your side, but trust me, Harry does what's best for Harry.

  This footage is from this morning, but CENTCOM just sent it over. 
  He climbed down off that rock face about an hour ago. 
  Couldn't have gotten too far. 
  I made contact with Matice, gave him the grid coordinates. 
  I thought we didn't have air support. 
  No manned support. 
  Unarmed drones only. 
  From the USS Peralta, which is about 17 nautical miles off the coast of Venezuela. 
  Called in a favor. 
  That's a pretty big favor. 
  Well, I may or may not have had several drinks with a JSOC colonel that I met last April. 
  April? 
  As in the month after we separated? 
  I like a man in a uniform. 
  - GREER: Check it out. 
  - Nice. 
  - Can you widen out? 
  - LISA: Yeah. 
  (TAPPING KEYS) 
  Someone's burning something. 
  LISA: That must be where he's headed. 
  GREER: Call Matice back. 
  (BIRDS SCREECHING IN DISTANCE) 
  MATICE: I'm ready. 
  Go ahead and send it. 
  MAN (OVER RADIO): Confirm coordinates 7-8-6-3. 
  Break 7-5-4-7. 
  MATICE: Roger that. 
  We're on our way. 
  All right, gents. 
  Change of plans. 
  - Apparently, he saw some smoke. 
  - Smoke? 
  Yeah. 
  And he's heading towards it. 
  Probably an indigenous village. 
  Looks like we can shave off some time if we cut through this ravine here. 
  - And give up the high ground? 
  - Guys either we can walk the creek bed, - or we can break brush for three days. 
  - All right. 
  When we find that idiot, you got to let me shoot him. 
  Just a flesh wound. 
  Maybe in the calf. 
  No, let's shoot him in the hand. 
  The one he jerks off with. 
  Yeah. 
  I like the hand idea.

  You said never sit with your back to the door. 
  Well, I feel safe here. 
  Hello, Annabelle. 
  Come here. 
  (SIGHS) 
  What happened to your eye? 
  I was chopping wood for a fire, and a splinter came up, hit me right in the eye. 
  Stupid. 
  I have something for you. 
  That's so nice. 
  Where is it from? 
  South America I believe. 
  It's lovely. 
  Thank you. 
  MAX: How are classes going? 
  ANNABELLE: Hard. 
  Except for cinema. 
  Any moron can do well at it. 
  Do you think? 
  I thought you quit. 
  - I'll quit after midterms. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Too much stress right now. 
  So how are you? 
  How's work? 
  Actually, that's why I'm here. 
  I have to go away soon, probably for longer than usual. 
  Is everything okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Of course. 
  Everything's fine. 
  I just wanted to make sure that while I'm gone, you have everything you need. 
  Use this phone if you need to reach me. 
  I stored the number in the contacts. 
  Under "Ripley". 
  Are you sure you're okay? 
  I know how to take care of myself. 
  JACK: Thank you. 
  (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) 
  Hello? 
  Hello? 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  Oh. 
  Jack Ryan, look at that business plan yet? 
  Tell me something good. 
  You know what, man? 
  I actually haven't had time to do that. 
  I been a little busy. 
  Okay, uh, well, look, not to be a nudge or anything, but my mom is my business partner, and she's kind of freaking out, so Totally get it. 
  Listen, how about this? 
  I'll, uh I'll look at it tomorrow, promise. 
  Well, why don't you look at it right now? 
  Well, right now I'm trying to break into an OS. 
  - Can you help me? 
  - (SIGHS) 
  Okay, um Can you call my cover number from a landline? 
  (PHONE RINGING) 
  London. 
  Dude, I did my semester abroad in London. 
  - Oh, did you? 
  That's - It'll just take me a sec to run it through the data we scraped. 
  Have you taken the Jack the Ripper tour yet? 
  Uh, no. 
  Bro, it is so creepy. 
  You know what they say, right? 
  What? 
  That he might have been a member of the Royal Family. 
  What? 
  I know, right? 
  Okay, firewall is down. 
  We're looking for any banking sites that Thorne visited, okay? 
  Names, account numbers, transfers he made. 
  Okay. 
  This one. 
  Try that. 
  Mm. 
  And go back to this one. 
  Whoa, whoa. 
  All right, next one. 
  - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
  - MIKE: Come in. 
  Got a minute? 
  Yep. 
  Just paying half the rent on my beach house, which I never get to use. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  I sign all 12 alimony checks at once. 
  I postdate them. 
  It's like ripping off a Band-Aid. 
  What's on your mind? 
  I went to see Gloria yesterday. 
  What? 
  I First-name basis. 
  It's just funny. 
  Oh, don't be a dick. 
  What's this? 
  I got it out of Sergio Bonalde's home safe. 
  I think it's what caused him to go missing. 
  It's columbite tantalite. 
  It's the ore from which tantalum is extracted. 
  - What the f*ck's tantalum? 
  - Oh, it's critical in all kinds of manufacturing. 
  You know, circuit boards, GPS systems, jet engines. 
  A f*cking laundry list. 
  Until now, all known sources were in China or the Congo. 
  They call that stuff "Blue Gold". 
  So you think somebody found a deposit here? 
  Yes. 
  Now, Ryan said the satellite from the South China Sea was launched by this company called Vogler. 
  They've patented this imaging technology that allows you to locate mineral deposits underneath the earth. 
  It's called "flash lidar". 
  You said it's valuable. 
  How much are we talking? 
  Trillions. 
  - What? 
  - Uh, right now, China has a monopoly on tantalum. 
  They turn off the spigot, and the entire tech business worldwide crashes. 
  But what if there was another source? 
  If Vogler broke up their monopoly, that would be seismic, right? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it would be. 
  Good work. 
  You keep me posted. 
  I got to run. 
  Hey, Mike. 
  Something else I wanted to talk to you about. 
  What's up? 
  Gloria told me yesterday that one of Reyes's men - gave her daughter a bullet. 
  - Jesus. 
  I wanted to take somebody over there and train up her security detail. 
  They're volunteers, mostly. 
  Farmers, cabdrivers. 
  And we want to give them a fighting chance to protect her until the election. 
  Right. 
  Take JosÃ©. 
  - He's good. 
  - Thanks. 
  Greer? 
  - It's off the record? 
  - Of course. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER, BABY CRYING) 
  (SIREN WAILING) 
  - Buenos dÃ­as. 
  - Buenos dÃ­as, seÃ±or. 
  Ah. 
  Thank you for coming, SeÃ±or Greer. 
  Come up. 
  Goddamn elevator right there. 
  (DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  - Mr. 
  Greer. 
  - SeÃ±ora. 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  I'd love some, thank you. 
  - This is JosÃ© Marzan. 
  - SeÃ±ora Bonalde. 
  Mr. Marzan is one of our local assets. 
  He knows his sh1t. 
  One man? 
  That's all? 
  JosÃ© will be spending a couple of days with your men, training them up so that they can better protect you and your family. 
  Now, given the politics of this, I'm afraid that's all I can offer you. 
  I wish I could do more. 
  - SeÃ±or. 
  - Gracias. 
  Please. 
  I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. 
  Can I ask you something? 
  Why'd you call me? 
  This is a very poor country, Mr. 
  Greer, and I needed someone Reyes can't buy off, and I'd like to think I'm a pretty good judge of character. 
  You gonna help me pack, too? 
  I have orders not to let you out of my sight until you're on the plane to Berlin.

  (ALARM STOPS) 
  Max. 
  Max! 
  (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
  I've gone through all of Thorne's transactions on his computer, and I found this one account. 
  It's Max Schenkel's. 
  Anything useful? 
  All the payments go through a slush account. 
  Thorne completely lied when he said he was just making introductions. 
  Guess who makes a large deposit into this account the day before Moreno was murdered. 
  Cinco Palmas. 
  It's all going through that lawyer I told you about. 
  Yeah, yeah, Monica Herrera. 
  I'm looking into her. 
  Anything else? 
  I got to call you back. 
  Harry. 
  He has a daughter? 
  Yes. 
  Annabelle. 
  Why didn't you tell me this from the beginning? 
  Before Jeremy? 
  Before Thorne? 
  It may be hard for you to understand, but there are lines I don't cross. 
  Using children as bait is one of them. 
  Really? 
  - You do it now. 
  - It's that or you die. 
  Me? 
  Why didn't he kill you in that elevator? 
  The one thing he always said was never care about anyone. 
  But he does. 
  He cares about me. 
  - And about Annabelle. 
  - And what about you? 
  I learned from his mistakes. 
  I mean, how do we even find her? 
  (SIGHS) 
  She's in school. 
  King Edward. 
  We can get there fastest by train. 
  (SPEAKING SPANISH) 
  (CHATTER IN SPANISH) 
  CROWD: Bonalde! 
  Bonalde! 
  Bonalde!

  Find Annabelle. 
  Oi! 
  Get out of the car. 
  Get out. 
  - (SILENCED GUNSHOT) 
  - (GASPS) 
  - Out.

  (GROANING, PANTING) 
  (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) 
  Annabelle? 
  - Do I know you? 
  - My name is Jack Ryan. 
  I'd like to talk to you about your father. 
  I'll catch up with you later. 
  You sure? 
  It's fine. 
  Can I see some identification or something? 
  Sure. 
  So, you work for the U. S. government? 
  State Department. 
  How did you find me? 
  Your roommate told me where you study. 
  What do you want with Max? 
  He's in trouble, Annabelle. 
  I need to find him. 
  If he's in trouble, then why isn't the BND helping him? 
  I'm not an idiot. 
  I know what he does for a living. 
  Okay. 
  Well, it's complicated. 
  But he has information that we can use, so I can help him. 
  Well, I don't know where he is. 
  I haven't seen him in months. 
  But you do have a way to contact him. 
  He contacts me. 
  That's how it's always been. 
  - Annabelle, please. 
  - I can't help you, okay? 
  I have to go. 
  Did you hear about Leicester Square? 
  About the shooting? 
  About the man who was killed? 
  Your father did that. 
  All I'm asking is that you call him. 
  (GROANS) 
  (PANTING) 
  Help, help, help, help! 
  - (MUFFLED SCREAMING) 
  - Stop. 
  Stop. 
  Now I'm gonna let you go. 
  And all I need you to do is not scream. 
  I just need you to call your father. 
  Or what? 
  You'll shoot me? 
  Annabelle, he's not who you think he is. 
  He left BND two years ago, and now he kills people for money. 
  You're lying. 
  - I think you know I'm not. 
  - (PHONE RINGING) 
  Hey. 
  Where are you? 
  MAX (OVER PHONE): I want to talk to my daughter. 
  Where is she? 
  I gave her a chance to walk away. 
  She didn't take it. 
  Put Annabelle on the phone. 
  I need to know that she's okay. 
  You don't dictate how this goes. 
  I do. 
  What do you want? 
  You tell me who hired you to kill Moreno. 
  I let Annabelle go, and I leave you alone. 
  In person. 
  So I know you will let her go. 
  Well, I assume you know where I am. 
  Come on. 
  (CHATTER IN SPANISH, PHONES RINGING) 
  SeÃ±ora Bonalde Don't count out El Hatillo and Sucre. 
  The polls say those are strongholds for Reyes. 
  Social media is telling a different story. 
  The tide is turning. 
  You could still take 'em. 
  Thanks for sending over JosÃ©. 
  He's been very thorough. 
  Sounds like there haven't been any more threats. 
  Nothing new. 
  But it's hard not to worry about my children. 
  That something might happen with them because of my choice to run. 
  But I imagine they're also the reason you are running. 
  Sounds like you have children as well. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I have a son, J. J. , who's turning 16 in a couple of months, and my daughter, Monique. 
  She's 13. 
  And your wife? 
  We're divorced. 
  At least you have closure. 
  I can't imagine being in your situation. 
  I don't know what's better to hold onto hope or move on. 
  In my experience with these situations hope is not a bad thing. 
  I'd better let you get back to work. 
  (QUIETLY): Yeah. 
  - Thank you for your help. 
  - Good luck with all this. 
  Your people deserve a leader like you. 
  Buenas tardes, SeÃ±or Greer. 
  (CELL PHONE RINGS) 
  Greer. 
  We just intercepted a call from Ubarri to his wife. 
  The recording worked. 
  He knows the walls are closing in on him. 
  I'm gonna pay him a little visit tonight. 
  - (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  Buenas noches. 
  (QUIET CHATTER IN SPANISH) 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  Your boss is beginning to have doubts about your loyalty. 
  You ever been to Miami? 
  I gather it's one of the better cities in the U. S. if your English isn't so bueno. 
  Hmm. 
  I think Cassandra and Maria would like it there. 
  We can protect you and your family in exchange for your cooperation. 
  You could have gotten me killed. 
  And now you come to be my savior. 
  We have planes running counternarcotics operations out of CuraÃ§ao. 
  You take your family on a beach vacation. 
  The minute your feet hit the ground, we will have you on a plane to the U. S. 
  The cost of that plane ticket is information about Reyes' mining operation in the jungle and how it connects to the death of a U. S. senator. 
  Or I can tell Reyes the CIA is approaching me. 
  Who said anything about the CIA? 
  Enjoy your meal. 
  I'm telling you, I'm getting some really bad vibes out here, man. 
  What are you, a f*cking psychic now? 
  I did a genealogy test. 
  I'm actually part Indian. 
  All right, well I'll take point for a while. 
  You can give your imagination a rest. 
  (CRICKETS CHIRPING) 
  JACK: Stop. 
  Go ahead. 
  Everything's going to be okay. 
  Tell me who hired you. 
  Never met him in person. 
  Everything was done electronically. 
  It was Reyes. 
  All this time, is that what you thought? 
  It would make sense. 
  I can see how much it would mean if it was. 
  You're telling me it wasn't him? 
  No. 
  Who was it? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Mr. Ryan I didn't come here to unburden you. 
  But seeing your pain is a happy accident. 
  (GUNSHOT) 
  (PANTING QUIETLY) 
  - Harry. 
  - I had no choice. 
  You have to go. 
  Now. 
  Go. 
  Go! 
  (PANTING) 
  - ANNABELLE: Papa! 
  - (FOOTSTEPS RUNNING) 
  (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) 
  Papa! 
  He-he's killed him. 
  He's killed him. 
  HARRIET: I'm sorry. 
  I couldn't get here before. 
  (SIREN APPROACHES) 
  What-what he said a-about my father, what he did, it wasn't true, it wasn't true.
