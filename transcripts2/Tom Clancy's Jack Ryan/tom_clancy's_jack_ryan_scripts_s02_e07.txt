  We're good, Ryan. 
  Relax. 
  So, Vogler Industries, they're the ones that found this deposit of, uh JACK: Tantalum. 
  MIKE: Right. 
  And they stand to make trillions. 
  Yeah, if they can figure out a way to mine it. 
  The process of extraction and refining is extremely toxic. 
  So they'd be looking at a lot of regulations and red tape. 
  Which is exactly why they need the local partner in Cinco Palmas. 
  That's Reyes. 
  Can you prove that? 
  No. 
  What happens if Reyes loses the election? 
  Well, then Reyes and Vogler get nothing, and that's exactly why they killed Jimmy. 
  Because they couldn't risk exposing anything this close to the election. 
  (PHONE VIBRATING) 
  sh1t. 
  (PHONE VIBRATING) 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Hey, babe. 
  What's up? 
  Where the f*ck are you? 
  MIKE: Uh, well, I can tell you where I'm not, but I think you already know that. 
  - f*ck you, Mike. 
  - Hey. 
  I wouldn't still be here if I didn't think it was the right thing to do, and you know that. 
  Well, tell that to the O. I. G. when you're getting your balls hammered. 
  Look, just talk to Greer, okay? 
  He'll explain everything. 
  Greer's not with me. 
  f*cking JosÃ©! 
  We got to go.

  Do you like the rum? 
  This is the cheapest rum in Venezuela. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Just the soldiers and borrachos drink it, but it's good. 
  It's like, uh lighter fluid. 
  Try some? 
  (SIGHS) 
  (SCREAMS) 
  - Where did they go?! 
  Where?! 
  - (MUFFLED GROANING)

  Something funny, coÃ±o de tu madre? 
  Ah sÃ­. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yeah, your boss must be really desperate if he has to rely on you. 
  Huh? 
  - Yeah. 
  That's funny. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
  Gloria. 
  (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
  (SEAGULLS CALLING) 
  Mike. 
  Mariana here? 
  She, uh, she drove to Colombia with Roberto and the kids. 
  Listen, Mike, I don't know what to tell you, but I Don't. 
  We're past that. 
  Where's Greer? 
  I took him to the airfield. 
  From this moment forward, every word out of your mouth had better be the f*cking truth. 
  Where'd you take him? 
  Reyes' men took him to a camp in the jungle. 
  - What camp? 
  - I don't know. 
  Somewhere near Puerto Maripana. 
  - You'll take us there. 
  - I don't know the exact coordinates. 
  But even if I did, it's heavily guarded by a whole platoon. 
  Did you kill Filiberto Ramos? 
  In the embassy, did you kill him? 
  Did you tell Reyes we had men in the jungle? 
  Mike (PANTING) 
  Did you tell him? 
  He threatened my family, Mike. 
  If I didn't help, they were gonna kill Mariana. 
  I didn't have a choice. 
  Can't leave him. 
  He'll just tell Reyes we were here. 
  I won't. 
  I swear. 
  Shut up. 
  We'll take him with us. 
  We need a car. 
  It's parked behind the house. 
  Give me the keys. 
  Let's go. 
  Get the car. 
  I'll be right there. 
  JOSE: Mike (GUNSHOT) 
  JACK: You all right? 
  No. 
  We're gonna rendezvous with what's left of the S. A. D. guys, and we're gonna make our way to the Colombian border. 
  But what about Greer? 
  Once we're out of the country, I'll lobby for a rescue mission. 
  You can't wait for a rescue mission, Mike. 
  Greer has a heart condition. 
  - Jesus Christ. 
  - That's why he's in Venezuela. 
  They pushed him out of Moscow. 
  - Why didn't you tell me this sh1t? 
  - I'm telling you now. 
  I don't see a lot of other options here, do you? 
  I mean, even if we go up there, we're five guys against, what, 35, 40? 
  Do you know how much money we have? 
  - SÃ­. 
  - SÃ­. SÃ­, mi amor. 
  (GENTLE BOSSA NOVA MUSIC PLAYING) 
  Oh, no, Miguel. 
  (SIGHS) 
  - Lisa - LISA: No, I told you, no one is going to approve a military operation in Venezuela. 
  What about a humanitarian one? 
  What? 
  Greer's being held in a prison camp with about 35 Venezuelan nationals. 
  They're under military guard. 
  What are you asking me for? 
  - Black Hawks for an evac. 
  - For the prisoners? 
  Political prisoners seeking U. S. asylum, yeah. 
  Says who? 
  You? 
  Reyes has them hidden in the jungle for a reason. 
  And I doubt it's because they're friends of the regime. 
  Okay, fine. 
  I'm I will see what I can do. 
  But if this happens, it is a humanitarian mission only. 
  There are no guns. 
  There is no firepower. 
  Okay? 
  It is evac only. 
  Yeah. 
  No problem. 
  And, uh one more thing. 
  - What? 
  - Not a big deal, it's just if you know somebody who could take out a satellite for us, it'd be great. 
  What the f*ck do you think I'm made of? 
  I mean, you think I can f*cking pull miracles out of my ass for you? 
  Jesus f*cking Christ!

  (COUGHING) 
  Slow, slow. 
  (COUGHING, WHEEZING) 
  What are you, a doctor? 
  No. 
  Medicine, no. 
  Of literature, yes. 
  I am Dr. 
  Porfirio GonzÃ¡lez at your service. 
  Jim Greer. 
  You are the first man from the United States that Reyes has sent here. 
  Yeah. 
  Lucky me. 
  You must have really f*cked up to end up in here. 
  Ah I pissed off the wrong people. 
  The president of Venezuela. 
  What? 
  Hey, what are you guys in here for? 
  You have here journalists who spoke out against government corruption. 
  Politicians who challenged Reyes. 
  Academics. 
  Artists. 
  We even have a sculptor. 
  What did he do? 
  He sculpted a statue of the first lady. 
  She was naked and being f*cked by the winged angel of justice. 
  (PAINED CHUCKLING) 
  We spoke our minds, and, for that reason, we were taken from our homes and our jobs, our families left behind to wonder what happened. 
  Does the U. S. know about this place? 
  Are more Americans coming for you? 
  - (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
  - (INSECTS TRILLING) 
  You know, I can think of 17 different ways this plan of yours could go wrong. 
  Just 17? 
  - Coming with you, man. 
  - No, you're not. 
  We should do this together, Jack. 
  Listen to me. 
  If anything goes wrong, I need someone to put the pieces together and prove what Reyes did. 
  Well, that's your area of expertise, not mine. 
  You know, I'm still your boss. 
  I could go upriver, send you to break into Monica Herrera's office. 
  I really hope you don't. 
  (GRUNTS) 
 
 
 
  Don't die. 
  Can't promise anything. 
  (INSECTS TRILLING) 
  Thorne's dead. 
  It's all over the news. 
  What are we supposed to f*cking do? 
  I've spoken to corporate. 
  Everything's getting sorted out. 
  People want to leave, let them leave, but they forfeit their share. 
  What the hell? 
  Search him! 
  The f*ck are you doing here again? 
  What's the money for, asshole? 
  Figured I'd hire you. 
  You got a lot of balls, coming out here without a weapon. 
  How 'bout I keep the bag of money and put a bullet through your brain? 
  But then you guys wouldn't get the five other bags just like that one. 
  Go on. 
  There's a prison camp in the jungle, 15 kilometers north. 
  We lost a guy, and we want him back. 
  Is it the one who did this? 
  Focus on the money. 
  Two bags now. 
  Eight when we finish the job. 
  - Deal. 
  - Deal. 
  Sorry for the hostilities, bro. 
  But you can never be too careful in this business. 
  No problem. 
  Couldn't agree more. 
  (WHISTLES) 
  (MEN MURMURING) 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  PORFIRIO: We hadn't have a new prisoner here in months. 
  We don't get any news of what's happening in the world. 
  The election? 
  There's an election coming up. 
  Reyes has a real challenger. 
  If he doesn't put his finger on the scale, she might win. 
  "She"? 
  Yeah, her name is Gloria Bonalde. 
  She's my wife.

  There's a guard tower on the opposite side, and there are machine guns stationed at the corners. 
  DISCO: Overlapping fields of fire. 
  - JOST: Probably pre-sighted. 
  - COYOTE: No doubt. 
  Let me see the case? 
  (BEEPING) 
  MARCUS: Is that good or bad? 
  You sure you saw an image the last time you checked this? 
  Yeah, but that was two f*cking days ago. 
  This ambassador that's in charge of the satellite - how reliable is she? 
  - Well, to be honest, I don't really know her that well. 
  She's the ex-wife of a friend of mine. 
  Well, f*ck it. 
  We've come all this way. 
  Let's do this. 
  We're in position. 
  (QUIETLY): Low. 
  (RAPID GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE) 
  What the f*ck is that? 
  - Who's shooting? 
  - It's not us! 
  Move! 
  Psst. 
  DISCO: f*ck is everyone? 
  - (RAPID GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE) 
  - Look sharp. 
  They're not paying us enough to walk into a f*cking ambush. 
  Clear.
