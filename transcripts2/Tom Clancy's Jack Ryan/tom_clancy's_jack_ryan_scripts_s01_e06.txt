 CATHY: Thanks for taking the time to get back to me.     
 I've got some pretty interesting news.     
 I went down to see Samuel Edeke, the Ebola index patient we sent over to you.     
 The rVSV vaccine hasn't worked for him.     
 Yeah, well, that would make sense.     
 He has EVD-  , and EVD-   is vaccine resistant.     
 Right. And if you're wondering how he got EVD-  when he wasn't in any of the patient clusters, I can answer that, too.     
 What happened?     
 During the last outbreak, Samuel's uncle was the guard at a WHO cemetery where all the EVD-   victims were buried.     
 Then, six months ago, two foreign men show up.     
 They offer his uncle $    to help them dig up a body.     
 The uncle, he gets cold feet.     
 But you know what     bucks is over here, so Samuel jumps in, he replaces him.     
 Wait, what does he mean by "foreign men"?     
 I don't know, two guys who were Middle Eastern.

 She and her daughters were staying in a camp outside of Hassa.     
 They were smuggled out last night.     
 We need to know where they are now.     
 Your friend is all business.     
 Yeah, I know the people who run the smuggling out of the camps.     
 They meet a lot of young women.     
 Some of these women come to work for me, to make money for their futures.     
 Well, of course, we'll pay you for the information.     
 The smugglers take them to the coast.     
 But it's much harder than a few years ago.     
 Most boats get turned back.     
 So they have to go much further.     
 Some go to Albania, Northern Italy, Croatia.     
 It's a hard journey, I...     
 Where? Where on the coast do they leave from?     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 It's not the entrance of a cruise ship, my friend.     
 It's changing every couple of weeks.     
 They have to avoid the police, or pay them off.

 Everything but them.     
 My son...     
 I want your word you will get him back.     
 Promise me.     
 I can't do that.     
 You know I can't.     
 But I'm the best chance you have.     
 That I can promise you.     
 (EXHALES)     
 I got it.     
 I got the location.     
 That's good. Sit down.     
 (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)     
 You want to know what happened to me in Karachi?     
 I was going after an asset.     
 The guy was a deputy chief of staff for the Pakistani army.     
 A huge f*cking get if I could turn him.     
 A game-changer for the Agency.     
 I got all the right signals.     
 I... had it all teed up.     
 I knew that he had money problems, a bad marriage, so we meet.     
 In a tea house, back of the room.     
 But... (SIGHS) the guy's nervous as a cat, and suddenly, in the middle of the talk, he changes his mind.     
 Not only does he not want to work with me, he wants to throw me in a Pakistani prison, where I'm gonna spend the next ten years...     
 ... if I'm not tortured or beaten to death first.     
 So...     
 I stabbed him.     
 Walked out before anybody noticed, and he died right at the table.     
 Three days before his daughter's wedding.     
 Guy had four other kids and... (SIGHS)     
 To this day, I keep thinking, "Was there anything else I could have said?"     
 Publicly, the Pakistanis said he died of a heart attack, but privately, to our government, they were f*cking livid, as were certain other persons on the seventh floor.     
 I had shot too high.     
 Took too big of a risk, so they PNG'd me back to headquarters.     
 There is no version of this job that doesn't require compromise, not if you want to do something that matters.     
 I don't believe that.     
 I believe you can make a difference without having to make those kind of compromises.     
 I know you do, 'cause once, a long time ago,     
 I used to believe the same f*cking thing.
