 A friend of mine in the Bureau told me a story.    
 After  /  , a guy who worked for American Airlines called the FBI tip line to turn himself in.    
 He was working at Dulles the morning of the attacks, checking tickets at the gate... business as usual.    
 And these two Middle Eastern fellas come through the line.    
 They presented their boarding passes, he checked them in and waved them on through.    
 As they're walking away, he happened to look down at their shoes, and he notices they're cheap.    
 Scuffed up.    
 They don't match the first-class tickets or pressed collared shirts and new khaki pants.    
 One hour later, those men flew that Boeing     into the side of the Pentagon.

 When we were in Paris, we uncovered correspondence between Suleiman and his brother Ali.     
 They were using a video game system's online messaging app to communicate.     
 Suleiman told Ali if he got out of Paris, he would send help.     
 So if we use the same video game system to contact Suleiman, we can just pretend that we're Ali.     
 Only the people in this room and the DGSI agents that we were with in the Alps actually know he's dead.     
 Why would he take the risk?     
 Sir, their parents were killed in in the Bekaa Valley.     
 They were forced to relocate to France.     
 They grew up in foster homes.     
 His brother is the only family Suleiman's got.     
 GREER: Not to mention the little brother saved big brother at Cobalt.     
 Sending someone after him is the least he would do.

 What?     
 Want a little pancakes with your syrup?     
 You want to talk about it?     
 About what?     
 So, I talked to the C.O.     
 And?     
 He told me to take some leave.     
 Ten days to decompress.     
 Whatever the f*ck that means.     
 He ordered you?     
 As of tomorrow.     
 - So what's wrong with that? 
- (GRUNTS)     
 Go to Lake Mead, get some pussy,     
 - chill out. 
- f*ck Lake Mead!     
 It's not like taking leave is gonna solve anything.     
 Then what will?

 I... I was in the top three percent in my class at flight school.     
 And then, a month before graduation, some dickhead master sergeant comes and says,     
 "Everybody pack your sh1t. The drone program needs bodies."     
 I was supposed to be a pilot.     
 So, what, you're pissed 'cause you didn't get the duty station you wanted?     
 No...     
 It's not about me, Ava. It's this. It's what we do.     
 We sit in a trailer   ,    miles away and we push a button and someone dies.     
 It don't matter if we're   ,    miles away or   ,    feet in the air; it's the same sh1t.     
 No, it's not.     
 Pilots, real pilots, they go to war.     
 They can get shot down, they can get captured, they can die.     
 We sit in a trailer and we play video games.     
 And then we come here and we have f*cking breakfast?     
 You're my boy, but you're trippin'.     
 Every bad guy I put in the dirt is one less bomb that goes off in a market somewhere, one less car that blows up at a checkpoint full of Marines.     
 And when we check in,     
 I need to know that my wingman has my back.     
 So whatever it is you need to do to get your mind right, you go do it.
