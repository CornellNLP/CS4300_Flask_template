 Previously on The Royals... 
 After examining these genetic markers, I can say that Princess Eleanor and His Royal Highness Prince Liam are not the genetic descendants of His Royal Majesty King Simon. 
 (Grunting and groaning) 
 Stay down! 
 You're supposed to be in New York City. 
 Everything you're chasing is in New York. 
 Not everything! I have to find him. 
 Jasper from Las Vegas... 
 Armed police! 
 Get on the floor! 
 Nobody move! 
 You need the Monarchy to be looked upon in a favorable light. 
 So I don't think you'll be telling anyone about anything. 
 Besides, there isn't anything you can do to me that you haven't already done. 
 Would Your Highness like an update on the King's condition? 
 I believe you meant "Your Majesty", as I'm now the acting King. 
 'I was wondering what my life might have been like had my mother not pushed me into marrying Simon.' 
 You were my queen long before you were theirs. 
 I want to do a television interview. 
 Something seemingly informal, but controlled. 
 I'm going to ask Parliament to place the Queen in power. 
 You'll be England's final monarch. 
 The King remains in a critical condition. 
 He's unresponsive and his breathing is assisted. 
 And his assailant? 
 This man has become a person of interest. 
 (She moans) 
 Listen to me. 
 I have information for you. Meet me tomorrow at midnight. 
 My brother didn't kill himself, did he? 
 No. 
 How do you know this? 
 'Cause I'm the one that killed him. 
 Sometimes you have to fight your way in. 
 This is where the plot thickens. 
 The Royals 01x10 
Our Wills and Fates Do So Contrary Run 
Season Finale 
 'By the time you read these words, it will be done. 
 I only hope you can understand and accept why I did it. 
 And that someday you'll forgive me.' 
 Liam. Seriously. 
 Call me back. 
 There is a very small possibility that I might actually be worried about you. 
 (Phone buzzing) 
 ♪ I've walked these miles ♪ 
♪ But I've walked 'em straight-lined ♪ 
♪ You'll never know what was like to be... ♪ 
♪ Fine ♪ 
♪ I'm wasting my young years ♪ 
 You okay? 
 I had a dream we left the safe room. 
 Then they declared me illegitimate. 
 Then you got drunk, got in a fight, and blacked out in the rain? 
 Not so much a dream. 
 I brought you home through the tunnels. 
 This was as far as I could get you. 
 I'm sorry for going dark. 
 It wasn't fair to you. 
 I was just worried about you. 
 My father... 
 He's still fighting. 
 They brought him home. 
 When you feel up to it... 
 I'm okay. 
 I mean... I'm hung-over and I could sleep for a week, but for the first time in my life... 
 I opened my eyes and I was free. 
 A life lived... not destined. 
 What? 
 Something my father said. 
 Let's get out of here. You want to? 
 Okay. We can go to my place. 
 No, I mean, somewhere else in the world. 
 Me and you. Today. 
 But your father... 
 Would want this. He told me as much. 
 Pick a place. Anywhere. 
 The first place that comes to mind. 
 Rio. I've always wanted to go. 
 Perfect. You in? 
 Liam, we can't... 
 Actually, for the first time, we can. 
 We can get out. 
 Haven't you ever thought about what that would be like? 
 I always wanted you. 
 It was your world I didn't want. 
 So let's make our own world. 
 Me and you. Starting today. 
 I can't tell my father. 
 We'll tell them when we land. 
 If we tell them before we go, then we'll never go. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 The truth is... I'm not going without you. 
 You're going on a little trip. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Three years in Gibraltar, caring for the diseased and infirm. 
 Your service is immensely noble and inspiring. 
 I did what you asked me to do. 
 I declared the Prince and Princess illegitimate. 
 Yes, you did. 
 But someone might want to change those results and I'm not sure we can trust you. 
 Trust me? I don't even know the results. 
 We didn't even test the blood. 
 Furthermore, the King has been moved into the palace and requires 24-hour care. 
 His life hangs in the balance. 
 Machines are breathing for him. 
 It is imperative that I be here. 
 We'll take care of him. 
 The Royal Jet is waiting. 
 Get on the plane, Doc. 
 Or what? Lose my career? 
 Your career? 
 Is that all you think you'll lose? 
 Liam. 
 I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. 
 By order of the Prince Regent. 
 Family only. 
 If you're going to speak to me like that, Lucius, you can at least address me as His Royal Highness. 
 I'm afraid that title has been taken from you, as well. 
 Cyrus can keep the title. 
 But I'm staying here. 
 If the Prince Regent has a problem with that, he can speak with me directly. 
 The King is my family. 
 But he's not yours. 
 So get out. Rules are rules. 
 So, what? You missed the s*x? 
 I've rescinded the charges against you. 
 No apology? 
 No. Get in. 
 The King is supposedly no longer my father, everyone is being manipulated by Cyrus, no-one is to be trusted, and I can't find Liam. 
 So, ironically, I now turn to you, the one person who I could never trust, who suddenly may be the only person who can keep me from waking up dead. 
 Now get in. 
 Do you even know how to drive? 
 No. But I am figuring it out. 
 Where's the...? 
 I knew that. 
 'We do what we have to do to protect the throne... and to protect ourselves. 
 This is not the end. I promise. 
 In many ways, it is our beginning.' 
 Comfortable at my desk? 
 It's Simon's desk. 
 It's the ruling Monarch's desk, and I'm not sure if you've heard, but that would be me. 
 Rachel. 
 Your Majesty? 
 I'd like to have this desk destroyed. 
 Preferably burned beyond recognition. 
 I'd like to have the ashes sprinkled into something that will fit up Cyrus's ass. 
 Oh. That shouldn't be a problem, Your Majesty. 
 Trust me, I know just the type. 
 I know you do. Thank you, Rachel. 
 My pleasure literally. 
 So we had a little tiff. Fine. 
 But moving forward we need each other. 
 Let's simply agree to full disclosure and our alliance will be invincible. 
 We both have a monarchy to gain. 
 And yet I'm the only one with a great deal to lose. 
 Ah, yes. Dear Alistair. 
 What are we doing about our dashing loose end? 
 I'm taking care of it. 
 How? 
 I said I'm taking care of it. 
 So much for full disclosure. 
 I was joking, Rachel. 
 Oh. 
 sh1t. 
 Well, it's the other halfy. 
 Did you say I couldn't see my father? 
 Not this again. It's for the King's safety. It's nothing personal. 
 It's completely personal and we both know it. 
 So now what? Do you plan to be a problem like your common-blood sister? 
 Actually... I plan to concede. 
 I have a proposition for you. 
 This should be interesting. 
 You want me gone? 
 You want to run the Monarchy however you see fit? 
 Fine. You can have it. I'll leave today. 
 What's the catch? 
 I need the plane. 
 I assume, since I've been stripped of my title and restricted from seeing the King, the plane is off limits, as well? 
 So if I give you access to the plane, you'll leave and not return? 
 That's right. 
 Fine. I'll even arrange a car to take you to the airport. 
 I insist. 
 No, thanks. 
 I don't trust you. Just the plane. 
 What, no hugs goodbye? 
 ♪ Would you bleed for me ♪ 
♪ Lick it off my lips like you needed me? ♪ 
 So let me get this straight. 
 The King's been stabbed, Liam's missing, and you've agreed to meet some self-professed psychotic murderer and you're not worried about that? 
 Of course I'm worried about that. 
 What do you think you're doing here? 
 Well, I don't know. What am I doing here? 
 As far as I can tell, you're the go-to guy for three things, Jasper. 
 To videotape and blackmail me. 
 To go down on my mother. 
 And to protect me from a psychotic murderer who wants to meet me under a bridge. 
 Considering we've already ticked the first two boxes, I figured you'd be up for the third. 
 Okay. But we have to go to the palace first. 
 Fine. But you'll have to wait in the car. 
 Wait. 
 You said the charges have been dropped. 
 They have been. Technically, you're allowed in the palace. 
 We just don't have time for you to sleep with my mum. 
 You realize there was no videotape... 
 Yes, I know that. Thank you. 
 Dad. You scared me. 
 Are you going to New York now? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a good opportunity. 
 I'm lucky to have it. It's what I want. 
 And did Prince Liam have anything to do with this? 
 I guess. 
 It's not gonna work out. 
 I'm sorry, honey. 
 But it's for the best. 
 Focus on your dancing. Chase your dreams. 
 Everything else will fall into place. 
 You're right. I'll call when I land. 
 And, if I get it, you can send my stuff. 
 Hey, I'll bring your stuff. 
 And you'll get it. And you'll deserve it. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 I love you, Dad. 
 Trust that I do. 
 Oh, I do. 
 And I love you, too. 
 More than anything. 
 And I'm proud of you.

 Lucius. 
 I'd like you to deliver this letter for me. 
 You're the only one I can trust. 
 I will guard it with my life, Your Majesty. 
 I know you will. 
 Is Your Majesty prepared for her interview this evening? 
 As much as I'll ever be. 
 Will you tell our advisors to make sure the interviewer doesn't stray from our script? 
 I will see to it personally. 
 (Ringtone) 
 Hello? 
 'Go to your vanity. Reach under it. 
 I need you to get me something.' 
 Under my vanity? 
 In my room? 
 Yeah. Where you kept your drugs for weeks. 
 Yes, thank you, but it's my room and they're my drugs. 
 Just hold on. 
 A gun. 
 'Yeah. Be careful. 
 The safety's on, but it's loaded.' 
 You kept a loaded gun in my room? 
 'Yes. I did. 
 Now set it down on the bed and go and check above your fake armoire.' 
 You're a piece of work, Jasper. 
 Is my mother's v*g1n* up there? 
 'You gotta let that go.' 
 Another gun. You're so American. 
 'You should be glad I am right about now. That one's also loaded. 
 Set it on the bed and go to the fireplace.' 
 You could have asked me before you did this. 
 'Considering our relationship, I didn't want you to have access to firearms.' 
 It wasn't a relationship. I'm at the fireplace. 
 Okay. Reach in and up. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Great. I've got your stash, Rambo. 
 Okay. Put the guns in the bag and get out of there. 
 Use the tunnels. Don't talk to anyone. And be careful. 
 Copy that. Over and out. 
 'We don't say that. And it was a relationship.' 
 
 
 
 Thank God! I have been so worried about you. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 I have so much to tell you. What happened to you? 
 I got in a little scuffle. 
 I have something to tell you, as well. 
 I'm leaving. With Ophelia. 
 What? When? 
 Today. Right now. 
 I want you to come with us. 
 Liam, I can't. 
 You can. We can just go, Len. Leave all this behind. 
 When Dad is well and we can make things right, we'll come home. 
 Come with us. I don't want to go without you. 
 I can't. Not yet. But you should go. 
 Len...  
 You know, I never thought you'd get out. 
 But it makes me so happy that you will. 
 And that you'll be with Ophelia. 
 But I'm gonna miss my brother. 
 Promise me you'll join us. 
 There's just a few things that I need to make right before I do. Okay? 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 Your Highness... 
 Can't talk. Gotta go. In a rush. 
 I understand you've moved on to an actual suspect. 
 You bring me this man's head and you might just save your job, Pryce. 
 I notice you haven't yet visited the King. 
 You might want to do so now. 
 Your mother's with him. 
 (Steady beeping) 
 Mum. 
 Son. 
 They told me he's not doing so well. 
 He's strong. He'll pull through. 
 I don't think he will. 
 That would put you on the throne. 
 Yes, I suppose it would. 
 You can do it. I've always known this time would come, and when it did, you would handle it with grace and humility. 
 You've always been a good boy, and I'm proud of you. 
 Thank you, Mum. 
 Now, let me tell you something. 
 You have to be careful. Especially with that brother of yours. 
 You can't trust him, Simon. 
 Mum? 
 Cyrus has always been jealous of you. 
 You have to watch him. He's not like you. 
 He never was... and he never will be. 
 Your father doesn't have much time left. 
 This is your time now. 
 I'll do my best. 
 Mum. 
 I know Dad loved you, and I love you, too. 
 And so does Cyrus. 
 Do you think so? 
 Of course he does. 
 Very much. 
 What kind of mongrel leaves without saying goodbye? 
 The private jet is waiting. Rio, is it? 
 We thought it best to leave first and say goodbye later. 
 It's a sound plan. But I prefer my goodbyes in person. 
 Six years. 
 I can't believe I'm finally getting rid of you. 
 My thoughts exactly, sir. 
 Travel safe and stay in touch. 
 It's been my sincere pleasure knowing you. 
 The pleasure's mine... sir. 
 Very noble of you, Marcus. 
 Watching the girl of your dreams ride off into the sunset and letting her go. 
 Too bad she won't be going to New York for that audition, though. 
 We Kensingtons are patrons of the arts. 
 My parents hear things. 
 She deserves to be happy. They both do. 
 Of course they do. But you've been around Liam for six years. 
 What happens when he grows tired of her? 
 We both know he will. He always does. 
 She'll be the girl who gave up her dreams and can't get them back. 
 Because by then it will be too late. 
 ♪ Are you happy now? ♪ 
♪ Are you happy now? ♪ 
 What are we gonna do? For money? 
 I brought a little cash. 
 And by "a little", I mean a lot. 
 We'll be fine. 
 And then what? We have to do something. 
 Maybe I'll be a fisherman. 
 That was always my father's dream. 
 How about you? 
 I'll have a flower stand. 
 A little cart on a pretty corner somewhere. 
 Will you miss dancing? 
 It's okay. 
 We can dance together and that will be more than enough. 
 What's that? On your chain? 
 You've seen my St. Christopher. 
 But why'd you change it? 
 Yesterday, when you found me in that alley... what time was it? 
 I didn't find you in an alley. 
 I found you in the park. 
 Prince Liam. There's a call for you. 
 I'll be right back. 
 By the way, you look beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello? 
 Hello. 
 This afternoon, in an unprecedented and historic event, Her Majesty the Queen has agreed to speak candidly from within the walls of the palace. 
 Recently the world was shocked to learn that Prince Liam and Princess Eleanor are not, in fact, legitimate heirs to the throne. 
 No. They are not. 
 Can you help us understand this? 
 Before I was your Queen, I was not an aristocrat. 
 I was not royalty. 
 I was just a girl. 
 'And then I met a young Prince... who would one day become King.' 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Is this your phone? 
 No. 
 When was Dr. Cohen on this plane? 
 This morning. We took him to Gibraltar for an extended service mission. 
 I can take that. 
 'At some point I decided to live with the lie.' 
 I decided it was better for everyone if I remained quiet about the truth. 
 What was the truth? 
 'The truth is that before I met the King, I was in love with a boy who worked for my father. 
 He was my first love, and I thought he was my future. 
 But then I met Simon. 
 The boy I had once loved enlisted in the army...' and I thought that we had both moved on with our lives until... until he returned on leave, shaken by what he'd seen in combat. 
 My heart went out to him and we... 
 I'm not proud of that night. 
 It was a mistake... but it was my mistake, until... 
 I learned I was pregnant. 
 You haven't publicly disclosed the name of this soldier. 
 Are you prepared to do so this evening? 
 This is a weight I've carried for most of my life. 
 'But as a gesture to the British people, whose faith I can only hope to restore one day... I will tell you his name.' 
 His name was... 
 Henry. 
 'He died in battle...' and I loved him very much. 
 Five minutes to landing. 
 I want to see. 
 Wait. Don't look out there. Look at me. 
 In five minutes, our lives are going to change, and I want you to understand why... before it happens. 
 Okay. 
 We talk about destiny all the time. 
 But it's always about my destiny. 
 It's always been about me and that's not fair to you. 
 It's okay. We're here now. 
 It's not okay. 
 I've been so selfish with you and I'm sorry, Ophelia. 
 Liam, what did you do? 
 It's New York. 
 Why are we in New York? 
 Because you have your own destiny and your own dreams, and I can't ask you to give them up. 
 Not yet. 
 Not ever. 
 You didn't have to do this. 
 I would have been happy without dancing. 
 But... we can be happy here, too. 
 You're not staying? 
 We have our own destiny, Ophelia. 
 No matter what we tell ourselves. 
 But you're not the heir to the throne anymore. 
 What happened on that phone call? What changed everything? 
 This pendant. 
 It's not mine. 
 I don't know how it got here or what it means. 
 And Dr. Cohen's phone. 
 For 25 years he's been with our family. 
 Why is he on the Royal Jet going to Gibraltar the day after a paternity scandal? 
 My father believed in a better life for all of us, and someone attacked him for it. 
 I have to go back and avenge him. 
 I have to go back and fight his battle. 
 It's always been my destiny. 
 No matter what. 
 I met this kid on the plane tour. 
 He said, "There's our duty... and there's our someday." 
 You are my someday. 
 You'll always be the someday I want. 
 But I have to go back and you have to stay. 
 It'll be easier this way. 
 The last time I heard that was when my mom dropped me off in the States. 
 And I accepted it because I thought there'd be a someday. 
 But there wasn't. 
 There was just... wasted time and then she was gone. 
 I don't believe in someday. 
 Not anymore. 
 Lucky for you, I do. 
 And I always will. 
 I promise.

 (Closes car door) 
 She lied. 
 I thought she was going to tell the truth about us. 
 She was protecting you. 
 She was protecting herself. 
 Are the kids mine or not? 
 It's all in here. 
 Just tell me if it says goodbye. 
 Her Majesty apologizes for tarnishing Henry's legacy. 
 And she asks that you forgive her for the fabrication. 
 She also requests that you do not contact her for a while. 
 A year or so. Until things improve. 
 She promises that she loves you and she will see you then. 
 But we both know that's not true, don't we, Lucius? 
 The part about seeing me again. 
 It's too risky now that she's made such a detailed public confession. 
 Her Majesty is a radiant and brilliant Queen. 
 But she's always had a blind spot when it comes to you. 
 It's nothing personal, Captain Lacey. 
 Please tell Henry the same. 
 (Two gunshots) 
 I should have had Marcus back us up. 
 He said trust no-one. 
 You have to trust somebody sometime. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Can we not do this now? 
 I might get shot in the face in a few minutes, so just hear me out. 
 The Queen knew who I was. 
 She threatened to expose me. I... 
 It would have taken me away from you, so I took a shot. 
 And you slept with her so you could stay close to me? 
 You're so sweet, Jasper. You are. 
 Most of my life has been about odds. 
 I... figured that I had pretty much already lost you, anyway, so I... 
 I took a shot, and I... thought maybe you wouldn't find out. 
 And if I didn't find out, you were just gonna live with it? 
 We all have sh1t we gotta live with, Princess. 
 Who's he? 
 He's the only one more screwed up than you are. 
 And he's with me. 
 Just don't be stupid. I've got a gun. 
 That's fine. I've got two. 
 You said you killed my brother. Why? 
 Where I come from, a little money is a lot of money. 
 So you killed him for money? 
 I killed a man with a hammer once. 
 Killed another man with my bare hands just for looking at my girl. 
 I'm sure she appreciated that. 
 Those times were for free. 
 I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him. 
 And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him. 
 They said it was a military accident. 
 Of course they did. 
 You gotta ask yourself, who "they" are. 
 Who are they? 
 I don't know. 
 I mostly operate UAV's. 
 At least, I did. 
 Unmanned aerial vehicles. 
 Drones. 
 Drones scare people but there's a lot of money there. 
 Soon, kids playing video games will be fighting wars from their bedrooms. 
 What does this have to do with my brother? 
 I was asked to take control of a manned aircraft. 
 I was offered a sum of money to do it. 
 I took the money and I scuttled the aircraft. 
 Your brother was the pilot. 
 And what about the King? 
 I don't know about that. 
 All I know is, the Major that contacted me is missing, and I expect to be next. 
 The least I can do is try and clear my conscience. 
 Might take that into account when I get to hell. 
 They won't. 
 Yeah. 
 (JASPER) What, that's it? That's all you got? 
 No. I've also got this. 
 My major used to get calls from the palace. 
 We called it Oz. 
 So you might take care close to home, Dorothy. 
 Why did you do this? 
 I told you. For the money. 
 No. Why did you tell me? 
 They left a note. 
 Called it a suicide. 
 That's not fair. To him or to you or to anyone left behind. 
 What kind of psychopath does that? 
 So far, so good. 
 The public is praising you on your refreshing honesty. 
 Oh, that. Good. 
 Oh, Lucius. Did you do as I asked? 
 Yes, of course, Your Majesty. 
 Your message was delivered and received. 
 Very good. 
 Thank you. 
 And did you do as I asked? 
 The Prince Regent's message was delivered and received. 
 It's in her best interest. It had to be done. 
 I couldn't agree more. 
 Hi, Ophelia Price. 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 Liam! What happened? Why are you back? 
 What's he doing here? 
 It's a long story. 
 Where's Phi? 
 It's a long story, too. 
 (TEXT MESSAGE) 
 She's auditioning now... Good. Hire her and keep her there. 
 It doesn't make any sense. Everyone loved Robert. 
 Maybe it wasn't revenge. 
 Maybe it was someone who hated the Monarchy. 
 Or someone who could benefit from his death. 
 And he said the calls were made inside the palace? 
 Yeah. 
 It has to be Cyrus. 
 Liam, what if it's not? 
 If it's not... he's got this coming, anyway. 
 They told me you'd returned on the plane. I thought we had a deal. 
 I changed my mind. 
 At least we got rid of that frolicking commoner. 
 A little dramatic, don't we think? 
 You think I'm gonna stab you? 
 Like you stabbed my father? 
 I'm not gonna stab you. 
 That would be too quick. 
 You can't do that. 
 Sure I can. 
 You killed my brother. You tried to kill my father. 
 Now it's time to confess. 
 Abolition is such a cowardly choice. 
 Lucius? 
 The Queen's asking for you. 
 ♪ Never cared for what they do ♪ 
♪ Never cared for what they know ♪ 
 Admit it! You wanted to kill my father! 
 Of course I wanted to kill him! I killed him every day. 
 I poisoned him, I drowned him, I shot him in the back. 
 I killed him every day of my life. But only in my heart. 
 You're lying! 
 I'm not. 
 I couldn't do it. He was my brother. 
 And you're an idiot! 
 You tried to hit me with a fireplace poker! 
 (Steady beeping) 
 (Rapid beeping) 
 (Urgent chatter) 
 (Groaning) 
 Admit it! 
 Help me! 
 Admit it, you son of a bitch! 
 Sir. 
 Please remove your hands from Great Britain's King. 
 God speed, my King. 
 And know that I'll avenge you. 
 I'll miss you, Dad. 
 (Buzzing) 
 Yes? 
 I see. 
 I understand. Thank you for calling.
