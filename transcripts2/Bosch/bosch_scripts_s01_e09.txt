 Aw, sh1t. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Woman : Detective Bosch. 
 Detective Bosch, any word on Raynard Waits? 
 Detective Bosch, is it true that the victim was a prostitute and that her body was found in a dumpster? 
 Ask Nate Tyler. He knows all the sordid details. 
 [All speaking indistinctly] 
 She worked the neighborhood, so we talked to the manager of the Hawaiian Sands Motel where the victim tricked. 
 He didn't see Waits pick her up, neither did any of her friends. 
 Johnson : And that minivan we're looking for... 
 A security cam on a storage facility picked it up drmng into the alley 7:42 P.M., exiting six minutes later. 
 Grab a plate? 
 Couldn't see it. 
 But there's a warehouse across from the murder scene. 
 They've got a security camera in their parking lot. 
 Keep your fingers crossed. 
 Waits went through a lot of trouble to stage these murders like your mother's. 
 Why? Why is he... why is he making it so personal? 
 Both came through the system... similar past. 
 f*ckin' bromance, that's what it is... 
 Waits' idea of a box of chocolates. 
 Let me know if you find anything on those surveillance tapes. 
 You better hurry. 
 Your compadre might not be around much longer. 
 Then I'll miss your inspired leadership, captain. 
 I've learned so much from you. 
 I'm not a lone voice crying in the wildernessanymore, Bosch. 
 A lot of peopleare onto you. 
 Talk to patrol, lately? [Chuckles] 
 Mankiewicz : Okay, next, Officer Jones here is going to review the penal-code sections relating to the laws of arrest that you all received in your training bulletins. 
 [All groan] 
 All right, all right. 
 I know you know this. 
 It's a post requirement. 
 So let's just get through it. 
 Do you need something, detective? 
 If you don't mind. I'll be quick. 
 All right, come on in. You have the floor. 
 As you all know, John Stokes is now the primary suspect in the murder of Arthur Delacroix, the Laurel Canyon bones case. 
 Oh, big f*ckin' surprise. 
 Hey, let the man talk. And watch your mouth. 
 We got to assume Stokes knows we're after him. 
 He missed his last appointment with his P.O. 
 And hasn't been to work. 
 He's in the wind. 
 Yeah, whose fault is that? 
 Listen, I get where you're coming from, but Detective Bosch put the Delacroix case together. 
 We wouldn't even be standing here talking about Stokes if it wasn't for him. 
 We got to find this guy. 
 I need you to hit the pavement, dig a little deeper. 
 Edgewood : Can you even charge this asshole? 
 It was 20 years ago. He was a juvie. 
 Let the D.A. figure that out. 
 All right, pass this out, put this on your visor. 
 Check your local smokehouses, talk to your snitches... 
 Anyone who might've seen him.

 Edgar : I just spoke to patrol. 
 I asked for a little extra effort on Stokes. 
 How'd that go? 
 Edgewood busted my balls. 
 Our job's to bring him in and close the case. 
 Tyler's article? Asshole. 
 Handed Waits a f*ckin' instruction manual. 
 What's she doing here? 
 Just got assigned to detectives'... Billets' grunt. 
 Marvelous. 
 Lieutenant wants all detectives to upgrade their personnel packages. 
 Set it there. 
 Detective Edgar. 
 [Knock on door]Come in. 
 [Door closes] 
 Brasher. 
 They got to put her somewhere. 
 "They"? 
 You mean Pounds. 
 Mm. 
 Captain makes the assignments. 
 He could've placed her anywhere... vice, subpoena control. 
 He's putting it to me. I don't dig it. 
 You brought iton yourself. 
 How? 
 'Cause I didn't back her fairy tale shooting story? 
 No, because you slept with her. 
 What if she files a beef? You could be in deep sh1t. 
 Thanks for the heads up. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Pimentel : Sir, have you seen this individual at all? 
 [Latin music plays] 
 Grace.[Sighs] 
 Thanks for coming. 
 [Sighs] I could use a drink. 
 Yeah, I thought maybe you might. 
 What are you having? 
 Fat Tire, please. 
 Uh, and Templeton with a splash, neat. 
 Bartender : No problem. 
 I thought you were a Stoli girl? 
 Eh, friend turned me on to rye... 
 Kind of like it. 
 Look, Harry, I'm sorry about this morning. 
 You were right. I'm the original slow learner. 
 Nah, you were having a shitty day, and I did not make it any better. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, come on. 
 Waits, Stokes, Brasher... 
 Jesus, Harry, could you digthe hole any deeper? 
 Halfway to China.You forgot Pounds. 
 Yeah, why does he have such a hard-on for you? 
 Eh, it goes back before you were there. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 He was a lieutenant, ran the Detective Bureau... 
 Didn't know what he was doing. 
 Should've known somebody that incompetent was sure to be promoted. 
 Yeah, promoted off our hard work in spite of his ineptitude. 
 Templeton neat and a Fat Tire. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 To China. 
 Ahh. 
 My friend says that everything that happens was meant to happen... because it happened. 
 Deep. 
 Mm. 
 Is this your rye friend or some other? 
 No, same friend. 
 Close friend. 
 You are not the only dumbass in the division. 
 I am... I'm in a relationship with a colleague. 
 Oh. 
 Maybe that's why I gave you so much sh1t... 
 Mad at myself. 
 [Sighs] Mm. 
 Let's hope your friend's right. 
 Mm. 
 It's all meant to happen.[Chuckles softly] 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Bosch. 
 Waits : It's New Year's Eve tomorrow. 
 Any plans? 
 Other than finding you? No. 
 Ah, I like your can-do attitude, Harry... 
 Something else we share. 
 What are your plans? 
 Well, I do have plans. 
 Well, I'd say more of a New Year's resolution. 
 Yeah? 
 You know, Harry, these phone calls, they're just not the same as face-to-face. 
 I like to look into a person's eyes. 
 Still, I'm... I'm gonna miss these conversations. 
 How's that? 
 It's time for me to go away. 
 Go away? You mean to your magic castle? 
 Oh, you know about that, huh? 
 Sure. 
 That's where Reynard the fox goes... to wait. 
 How's that sump pump working? 
 Castle a little drier? 
 Oh, congratulations. 
 You figured out my nom de guerre... finally. 
 I'd beginning to wonder if you ever would. 
 I'm getting off now. 
 We also know about Maclaren. 
 Is that why you singled me out... 
 Dogs from the same kennel? 
 When they put you in the trunk, Waits, how'd you do time? 
 I did baseball stats. 
 You're just trying to keep me talking. 
 By the way, I know how you found out about the starfish. 
 Yeah, I was proud of that one. 
 I'm getting off the phone now. 
 We're closer than you think. 
 A bientot, Harry. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 So, we got another pic of the van from that warehouse. 
 Johnson : We got the plates, too. 
 Unfortunately, they belong on a 2001 Honda Accord... 
 Owner had it in long-term parking at L.A.X. 
 You can see the driver's face. 
 It's obscured by the visor, but look at that in the rearview. 
 It's a handicap tag. 
 Hmm. Said his mother was infirm. 
 Well, we're still going through the Maclaren files. 
 We're trying to narrow down the kids who both fit the time frame and spent time in isolation. 
 Think they might've digitized this sh1t? 
 We still have several hundred to go. 
 What else you gonna do on New Year's? 
 [Both chuckle] 
 [Baby cooing] 
 Excuse me. A-are these yours? 
 No. 
 Oh. 
 Ah, they're persols. I found them. 
 Someone's gonna be looking for them. 
 I wonder if there's a lost-and-found around here or something. 
 Oh, uh, I don't know. 
 Oh, what a beautiful baby. [Chuckles] 
 [Gasps] Hi. How old? 
 Six months. 
 Oh, he's just a little guy. 
 Look at him. [Baby cooing] 
 [Singsong voice] Hey, you. 
 [Normal voice] We have an 8-year-old. 
 Aww. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 They grow up fast. Be good to your kids. 
 Yeah, that's what everybody says. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Boy, that's such a relief... isn't it?... 
 When they finally fall asleep. 
 [Sighs] 
 Give you a little time to yourself. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Singsong voice] They do keep you busy. 
 Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 Mm. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 Bosch : No, it's downloaded. 
 It [Sighs] I... yeah, I set up the account. 
 Hold on. I'm gonna put you on speaker. 
 [Cellphone beeps] Can you hear me? 
 Maddie : Yeah. Scroll through your contacts. 
 I only have one contact... you. 
 Well, click on me, and then click where it says "video call." 
 [Computer beeps] 
 Hey, I can see you. 
 [Echoing] All right, turn off your phone. 
 Okay. [Cellphone beeps] 
 You did it, Harry. 
 Mom doesn't know what she's talking about. 
 What do you mean? 
 She says when it comes to computers, you're hopeless. 
 You're bruised. You should go see a doctor. 
 I told you I'm fine. 
 Can we please not talk about the accident? 
 Want to make sure you don't have whiplash. 
 Maddie : Mom has so overreacted. 
 Not only am I grounded, but she's monitoring my Facebook. 
 Harry, the accident wasn't my fault. 
 Yeah, well, Mads, you had no business being in that car. 
 The driver was a minor, right? 
 Not supposed to be driving other kids. 
 [Sighs] Yeah. I messed up. 
 I said I was sorry. 
 I just don't understand why she has to torture me. 
 [Knock on door] Eleanor: Maddie? 
 I'm talking to Harry. 
 See? She won't leave me alone. 
 When can I come and see you? 
 As soon as I close this case. 
 Dinner's on the table. 
 Okay. 
 I got to go. 
 Don't work so hard. 
 I love you. 
 Happy New Year. 
 I love you, too. 
 Happy New Year. 
 [Computer beeps] 
 [Baby crying] 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 [Crying continues] 
 [Hard rock music plays] 
 Oh! 
 Bottoms up. 
 Phew! 
 There you go. 
 Man : Ah! 
 'Sup. 
 Happy New Year, Pierce. 
 Same to you, George. 
 Yeah. How's that new partner? 
 Good. Thanks. How are you? 
 Ah, I'm changing tracks... going inside. 
 Next D.P. is downtown for me. 
 [Chuckles] Planning and research. 
 You? Pogue job? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Thought you loved the streets. 
 Dead end. 
 Nah. Command's where you want to be, brother. 
 [Music continues] 
 [Keys jingling] 
 [Muffled screams] 
 Waits : Here we are. 
 [R&B music plays, indistinct conversations] 
 Johnson : Need anything that'sin writing, it'd be braille. 
 And if you do get an invi... 
 Hey, Barrel. 
 Hey! Happy New Year. 
 Yeah, happy New Year. 
 Hey, Renee. 
 Hey. How are you? 
 This is Marissa. 
 Hi. 
 I love your dress. Are those peacocks? 
 Oh, well, I have a thing for peacocks. 
 Grew up in Rolling Hills. 
 There were lots of them... wild. 
 They make such a racket, people shoot 'em now... 
 A peacock vigilante. 
 [Laughs] That's awful. 
 Well, it's just a fact. Lot of ruffled feathers. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 How's Crate? 
 Great. 
 He's busting out of the hospital tomorrow. 
 Ah. To Crate. 
 To Crate. 
 Hey, guys. Get you anything? 
 Edgar : I'm fine. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 So, he's getting out tomorrow. 
 He's getting out tomorrow. 
 Starting to talk... 
 [Music continuesin background] 
 Just a minute. 
 Happy New Year. 
 Happy New Year. 
 [Woman crying] 
 [Muffled moaning, screaming] 
 Waits : Hey, sit down. 
 Shh! 
 [Crying, gagging] 
 Are you gonna be quiet? 
 Huh? Mm-hmm. 
 [Retches] Ew. 
 [Crying, gasping] 
 My baby. 
 Oh, he'll be fine. 
 Have some water. 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 [Gulping] 
 
 
 
 ♪ You said you'd always be true ♪ 
 Hey! Harry! 
 [Laughs] 
 I didn't think you'd show. 
 How you coming with those Maclaren files? 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Happy New Year to you, too. 
 Happy New Year. [Chuckles] 
 Hey, beautiful. 
 Oh, hi, Harry. 
 Edgar : Harry. This is Marissa. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Where's Grace? 
 Yeah. 
 Grace. 
 Oh. Wow. Alert the press. You're here. 
 Mwah! [Cellphone ringing] 
 Thank you. This is great. 
 [Cellphones ringing, vibrating, and beeping] 
 What's that? 
 [Keypads clicking] 
 [Ringing, vibrating, and beeping continues] 
 ♪ Well, I seen you with Miss Mary ♪ 
 Behind me is the victim's car. 
 Her 6-month-old baby, who was left alone in his stroller, appeared to be unharmed. 
 He was taken to Children's Hospital for observation. 
 Man on TV : Thank you, Tina. 
 In addition, KCYD has learned that the suspect left a macabre note in the baby's carriage... 
 Quoting now... 
 "Raynard Waits wishes you a happy New Year." 
 m*therf*cker. 
 Ms. Lyndon's husband reported her missing after she and the baby failed to return home from an outing in Echo Park. 
 Her husband says Ms. Lyndon frequently meets other mothers in the park, but today went alone. 
 Waits, the self-confessed serial killer, escaped from LAPD custody two weeks ago... 
 Billets : Where's Bosch? 
 Took off as soon as this came on... sparking a city-wide manhunt and terrorizing citizens during this holiday season. 
 What's he doing? Why this woman? 
 Eleanor : It's about you, Harry. 
 The last murder imitated your mother's. 
 This abduction, it's related. 
 How so? 
 [Sighs] 
 The woman in the alley represents how society saw your mother, as a prostitute. 
 This young woman represents how you saw your mother, as loving and pure. 
 He wants this to hurt. 
 The four other victims, he left their bodies so they could be found. 
 But this woman... no body. 
 She could be alive still. 
 I think you're right. 
 I think it's all part of his endgame. 
 I think he's using her as bait for you, Harry. 
 Thanks, Eleanor. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 You'll be asleep when I get back. 
 [Smooches] 
 Sweet dreams, Harry. 
 I love you. 
 Security was heightened at this year's Rose Parade after the abduction last night of Heather Lyndon. 
 LAPD chief of police John Tenzer has mobilized the department, putting it on tactical alert until the suspect, Raynard Waits, is apprehended. 
 Tenzer : All officers will be on mandatory 12-hour shifts, with the deferment of days off and the recalling of off-duty officers. 
 Mr. Waits' actions will not go unanswered. 
 He will be brought to justice. 
 [Metal clattering] 
 Do you need this? I will help you. 
 [Rat squeaking] 
 Do you see that? 
 I put down mothballs, they still come. 
 Please. 
 Let me go. 
 I can't do that. 
 Why? Why am I here? 
 I need you. 
 I'm sorry it's so damp down here. 
 It's been a wet winter. 
 I got to make a call. The reception's not very good. 
 Please! 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Nate Tyler. 
 Waits : This is Raynard Waits. 
 Okay. 
 How do I know it's really you? 
 Because the woman I took had a coral necklace. 
 You could check that out with the police. 
 She's still alive? 
 I didn't call you to talk about her. 
 You did a very good job writing about Detective Bosch... 
 Very touching how you described his mother's murder. 
 I-I found it very inspirational. 
 Inspirational? 
 I want youto write my story. 
 Uh... 
 Okay. 
 I can do that. 
 That's all you could say? 
 How about, "thank you"? 
 How about, "I'd be f*cking honored"? 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Like my mother used to say, "good manners cost nothing." 
 You mind if I record this? 
 Whatever. 
 Just get it right. 
 Surprised to hear from you. 
 Exclusive with a serial killer... 
 I thought you'd go straight to press. 
 I know that you think I'm an asshole. 
 I couldn't know Trent was gonna kill himself or that Waits would... murder that woman. 
 'Cause of what you wrote. 
 Look, I don't want anybody else to die, okay? 
 Call you on your cell or landline? 
 Cell. 
 You record the conversation? 
 Gimme the phone. 
 I can't give it to you. You know that. 
 Be breaking every rule of journalism. 
 Gimme the phone. You can't have it both ways. 
 If The Times found out, I'd be crucified. 
 [Sighs] 
 What if he calls back to check in on things? 
 He said he would. 
 We'll transcribe the conversation, have your phone back to you in an hour. 
 When he does call you back, tell him the profile is bigger than mine... 
 Better, too. 
 Keep him talking. See if he'll meet you. 
 Hold on. 
 I helped you out. 
 You owe me, right? 
 I owe you nothing. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Siren chirps] 
 Bosch : "My true name will come out in due course, "and it is a name that no one will ever forget. 
 "I am the only onewho knows the truth. 
 "I will expose and punish the oppressors and abusers. 
 I have built a monument to serve as a reminder of my justice." 
 He just go on like that? There anything we can use? 
 Blase, blase, blip, blip, blip... psychosis on parade. 
 Then he says, "my mother would take me to see the Lady of the Lake. 
 "My mother would say, 'you won't always have me, but you will always have the Lady of the Lake.'" 
 "Lady of the Lake"? What is that, like a movie? 
 It's a statue... Echo Park. 
 Echo Park again. 
 Heather Lyndon. 
 Also pinged this number to a vacant lot. 
 In Echo Park. 
 Center of the doughnut. 
 The night Waits was arrested with a body in his van... 
 I don't think he was looking to dump the body. 
 I think he was taking it home. 
 Well, we got 22 Maclaren boyswho fit the profile, have the A-C 1-0-2 designation, and have some connection to Echo Park. 
 That's five apiece. Let's divvy 'em up. 
 "Mark Gill... Maclaren, '80 to '82." 
 The Gill family lived on Scott Avenue. 
 Let's start with this one. 
 Hold on. 
 David Harris... 
 In and out of Maclaren '79 to '88, three years in foster care... Irene and Harlan Saxon. 
 4518 Lemoyne. 
 We'll take this one. 
 Bye-bye. 
 What's so special about Harris? 
 French connection... Reynard the Fox... 
 Yeah. 
 The catacombs. 
 Foster mother, Irene Saxon... 
 She was a French teacher. 
 Edgar : Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 [Button clicks] 
 The foster dad, Harlan Saxon, is deceased. 
 Kiz pulled his death certificate. 
 He died from mesothelioma. 
 Asbestos. What Waits said. 
 Oh, but here's the kicker, Harry. 
 David Harris fell off the grid in '93... 
 No public record of him of any kind after that. 
 Then a few months later, in '94... 
 Guess what. 
 Raynard Waits appears. 
 [Banging on door] 
 Mrs. Saxon, LAPD. 
 [Bangs on door] 
 Let's take a look around. 
 [Gags, coughs] 
 Dead body. 
 [Sniffs]No sh1t. 
 Waits said his mother died. 
 [Coughs] 
 Door right. 
 Edgar : Clear. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Coffee maker's warm. 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Grunts] 
 Clear. 
 [Gagging]Closed door left. 
 [Coughing] 
 [Both gagging, coughing] 
 Jesus! Ohh. 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 [Both coughing] 
 [Groans] Mn-mnh. 
 Garage. 
 Bosch : Clear. 
 Clear. 
 Let's get backup here, task force... 
 Tear this place apart. 
 [Radio beeps] 6-William-22. 
 I'm code 6 at 45... [Static] 
 sh1t. Rover's no good. I'm going back to the car. 
 Do it. 
 [Water running] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Flashlight clicks off] 
 David? 
 You better be alone... for her sake. 
 I'm alone. 
 Please help me! 
 This is between you and me. Let her go. 
 You said you liked to look people in the eyes when you talk to them. 
 Why don't you come out here and look into mine? 
 No, you come here. 
 There you are. 
 Here I am. Let her go. 
 You know that's not gonna happen, Harry. 
 Why even bring it up? 
 Please. Please. 
 Shh! We're talking. 
 So, how do you like it? 
 Your monument? 
 Took me 20 years. People should appreciate it. 
 Is that what you want, David, people to appreciate you? 
 Don't talk to me like that... like a f*cking shrink. 
 Can't we have a real conversation, huh, for once? 
 Sure. 
 People need to know my story. 
 [Whimpers] 
 I mean something. Do you understand? 
 Y-you know the expression, Harry, "a prophet is without honor in his own country"? 
 Yeah, I've heard it. 
 [Moaning] 
 What were your foster parents like, Harry? 
 Had several... wasn't close to any of them. 
 [Moaning intensifies] 
 The Saxons were beautiful people. 
 When they took me in, I thought I was done with Maclaren. 
 We had some good years. 
 And then pop got sick and died, and they sent me back. 
 You know all about that, Harry. 
 You know all about the darkness, don't you? 
 I do. 
 I know all about the darkness. 
 You know, Harry, I envied you at Maclaren. 
 You were strong. You could defend yourself. 
 You didn't take sh1t from anybody. 
 You didn't let anyone take advantage of you. 
 [Sirens wailing in distance] 
 They're coming. 
 Good. 
 [Whimpering] 
 Let's get this over with. 
 [Crying] No! No, please! Ohh! 
 Hurting her isn't gonna change anything, David. 
 Why are you so f*cking blind, Harry? 
 I've tried so hard, so f*cking hard, to get through to you. 
 Why can't you see me? 
 I can see you. 
 No, you can't. You can't. 
 They made me. They made me what I am. 
 Do you understand? 
 You get it? 
 I'm the monument... me, me... 
 Aah! 
 And you. 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Crying] 
 [Wailing continues] 
 It's all right. 
 [Helicopter blades whirring, indistinct conversations] 
 F.I.D. needs to talk to you. 
 Right. 
 Jesus. 
 Cannot imagine what it was like to be there, you know, with him. 
 Yeah. 
 But he's still dead. 
 Harry, you did good. 
 Bosch. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Sir. 
 Reporter : Can you give us a comment? 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 There's a happy man. 
 I'm sure he thinks this buys him a second term. 
 We'll see about that. 
 Evening, chief. 
 Proud day for the department. 
 Yes, indeed. 
 Congratulations, Irv. Good job. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Let's have a look. 
 [Door closes, camera shutters clicking] 
 You start working the media. 
 Make sure they know the lead that broke this case came outof the task force. 
 Bosch might be the hero, but we broke this case. 
 Got that? 
 Yes, sir. 
 All right. 
 Congratulations. You got your man. 
 Go to hell, Grace. 
 You think your pal Harry Bosch is out of the woods? 
 He isn't. 
 Anyways, I'd like to do a walk-through of the scene before we head back to the station. 
 Is your league rep here yet? 
 I haven't seen him. 
 Well, as soon as he shows, we'll get on with this. 
 Yeah, good. 
 [Ringing] 
 [Receiver clicks] 
 We found Waits. 
 Eleanor : He's dead, isn't he? 
 Yeah. I put him down. 
 And the woman? 
 Safe. 
 Thank God. 
 Eleanor, give Maddie a kiss for me, tell her I love her, will you? 
 Sure. 
 Good night, Harry. 
 Good work, detective. 
 What was that about? 
 Waits' gun. 
 Yeah? 
 There were no rounds in the weapon. 
 Suicide by cop... 
 By me. 
 What does it matter? 
 He's gone. 
 You have a long night ahead of you, detective. 
 I'll let you go.
