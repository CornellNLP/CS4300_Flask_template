 Edgar : I'll make it up to you. 
 I've got a hook up with a guy who'll get us a table at Mozza. 
 I'll call you tonight, baby. 
 Please, baby. I know a guy. 
 Remember to get us a gas card, or you too busy making plans to get your ashes hauled when you get back? 
 [chuckles] See, Harry, if you wasn't such a f*ckin' monk, you'd know what it's like out there. 
 It takes a lot of maintenance. Yes, I got the gas card. 
 Then let's get goin' or we're crossin' the desert at high noon. 
 [phone rings] 
 Hold up. Bosch. 
 When? 
 Send him back. 
 Nash. 
 Wants to tell us he solved the case? 
 Hm. 
 Carl. 
 Wish you'd called. 
 Gettin' ready to hit the road for Vegas. 
 Picking up your guy? 
 The extradition hearing's first thing tomorrow morning. 
 Yeah, that's sort of why I came in if you've got a minute. 
 A minute, sure. 
 Yeah. Someplace private? 
 Grab a seat. 
 Yeah, the other day... when you were asking me about Tony Allen-- 
 Yeah. 
 What's on your mind? What'd you leave out? 
 Okay. About six months ago I'm doing my rounds. 
 It's a nice evening, windows down, I roll past the Allen's house, I hear voices. 
 An argument. Two men, sounds like it could get out of hand. 
 So you thought you'd check it out. 
 Yeah. So I park. I walk down the side of the Allen's house, Allen and this other guy are in-- looks like a home office, goin' at it. 
 What about? Could you tell? 
 Money. 
 The other guy's like, "Where's my money, Tone?" over and over, and Allen's like, "Oh, I wouldn't do that to ya, I swear." 
 Other guy, he sign in at the gate? 
 I checked the log. There were no visitors for the Allens that night. 
 So he must have come in with Tony. 
 So why are you tellin' me this now? 
 You said there'd been an arrest in Vegas. 
 I was-- started thinkin', yeah, we talked about made guys, mob guys. 
 I just remembered this guy Allen had the fight with. 
 I mean, he had that vibe, the, you know-- 
 Vegas wise guy. 
 Absolutely, definitely. 
 Mobster all the way. 
 Think you could pick him out of a six pack? 
 Yeah, I think I could. 
 Follow me. 
 [sighing] Nah. It's none of these guys. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 That's the guy. That's the guy! 
 You sure about that? 
 No doubt. 
 Okay, we'll check it out. 
 Really appreciate it, Carl. 
 Thanks. 
 Am I-- Am I right? He's a made guy? 
 We talk to him, we'll ask him about that. 
 Okay. [chuckles] I-- I should shove off. 
 Uh, good luck in Vegas. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks for coming in. 
 Yeah, safe travel. 
 Joey Marks.

 Edgar : We got time for this? 
 Check in's not 'til 3:00. 
 Is it worth it? We got Rykoff. 
 On a platter. 
 Your Christmas pig. Courtesy of the FBI. 
 Feds got it all worked out. 
 Rykoff will give them Marks, and Marks will give them something on the Russians. 
 And that will give them something on their counter terrorism thing. 
 Exactly. 
 Still want to find this Layla, ask her what she knows. 
 Yeah, this is all residential. 
 Yeah, and Tony wrote it off on his taxes as an office. 
 I dig this. What is this? 
 Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis on Miles' album "Bag's Groove." 
 Sweet. What's it called? 
 "Doxy." Sonny wrote it. 
 You know a lot about this stuff. 
 A little. 
 Ever listen to anything written in this century? 
 Still catching up on the last one. 
 Pull over, this is it. 
 ♪♪ 
 Some office. 
 This is the life, huh, Harry. 
 Where did we go wrong? I mean, we could be out here poolside hangin' with these fine ladies. 
 You sure you guys don't need a warrant? 
 We're checking on her well-being, sir. 
 She was romantically involved with a man who was murdered recently. 
 Murdered? That's awful. 
 Just making sure she's okay. 
 Of course. Hope to God she's all right. 
 Bosch : Last time you saw here? 
 Ten days, two weeks. Something like that. 
 How'd she pay the rent? 
 Direct deposit, first of the month. 
 I wouldn't be expecting a deposit next month. 
 Yeah, it doesn't look like she's comin' back. 
 Did she fill out an application before she moved in? 
 Credit check, rental history. 
 We're gonna want to take a look at that. 
 I have it in the office. 
 We'll stop on the way out. Thanks. 
 When are we gonna interview the girls at the pool, Harry? 
 Left dirty dishes. 
 Cell phone. 
 No wonder we couldn't locate it. She killed it. 
 Smart. 
 What are those? 
 They're in Armenian. Religious, maybe. 
 Little girl, Layla? Grandma, maybe? 
 That's not L.A. for sure. That's the old country. 
 Remember me? 
 Ah, you're one of the assholes who busted Lucky. 
 We're looking for Layla. 
 Knock on her door? 
 Cut the sh1t. 
 You know she's gone. 
 Where'd she go? 
 No idea. 
 Soon as she heard Tony was dead, outta here. 
 You see her go? 
 Nope. 
 So how'd you know? 
 Her car was gone. Poof. 
 Where would she go from here? 
 Now that her guardian angel's gone, who the f*ck knows. 
 Why would you call him that? 
 She worked in this sh1t hole in North Vegas with some other foreign girls. 
 Not a nice place. Tony pulled her out of there. 
 A brothel. 
 I'd call it a cat house, but hey. 
 George : Yeah, still waiting on details. 
 What time? 
 Uh, tonight. 
 They said they'd let me know. 
 And this woman, Mo. 
 Yeah, I've been workin' on that. 
 Matched her face to a name. 
 Maureen O'Grady. 
 Vice cop. Mission Division. 
 Good work. 
 Yeah, well, it's a start. 
 We'll see who shows up to the party tonight. 
 When do you see Lyle next? 
 Day after tomorrow. 
 You doin' okay with all of this? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I, um-- I know it's been hard for you. 
 To make your own way in the department, find yourself, get out from under my shadow. 
 Uh, well, you know, I think I've got a really good shot of doing that with this gig. 
 You know, if I could just get to the head of that snake. 
 I'm confident you will. 
 Well, thanks. 
 This look like a North Vegas sh1t hole to you? 
 Yeah, the previous address on her rental app. 
 Bet there's no pool. 
 Everybody sit tight. 
 We're looking for this girl, Layla. 
 She used to work here, live here? 
 [speaking Russian] 
 Anybody know where she is? We need to talk to her. 
 [speaking Russian] 
 You work for Joey Marks. This is his place. 
 This is my place. 
 Hey, get the f*ck outta here. Go. Now. 
 Look, you want to tell me fairytales, I got nothin' better to do. We can stay here all day, and you can explain to Joey Marks where all his business went. 
 The girl you look for, Layla, she not been here a long time. 
 Couple years. 
 Where'd she go? 
 She's dancer. Probably strip club. 
 Dolly's? 
 She meet customer. 
 [speaking Russian] 
 Customer? 
 Customer fall in love with Lilliat. 
 Lilliat? Is that her real name? 
 Lilliat Saroyan. 
 Lilliat Saroyan. You know where she is? 
 I do not know. Please, leave now. 
 That was f*cking depressing. 
 What do you think, they traffic? 
 Someone should talk to those women, find out if they're free to leave, and who's got their passports. 
 Joey Marks? 
 It's his place, I'll reach out to Felton, let them handle it. 
 How do people live out here? 
 It's a f*ckin' desert. 
 L.A.'s a desert. 
 With an ocean. 
 It's still a desert. 
 I thought you loved L.A. 
 I do, but I know what it is. 
 [girls laughing] 
 Hmm. 
 Hey, how about some new shades? 
 Ray Bans? 
 Retro girl. Take after your dad. 
 I hope so. 
 Look, there's Monocle Optical. 
 Let's take the stairs. 
 It's on the third floor. 
 We can use the exercise. 
 I get lots of exercise. 
 Yeah, your thumbs look really strong from all that texting. 
 Ha, ha. Very funny. 
 [chuckling] 
 Thumb war? 
 No way. 
 Hey. 
 Oh. [sighs] 
 Anything else? 
 Oh, I got my Krispy Kremes, coffee, good to go. 
 Have a good day, officer. 
 All right. 
 [door opens] 
 [bell dings] 
 Asshole. 
 [sighs] 
 [phone line ringing] 
 Hey, you've reached George. 
 Leave a message. Call you back. 
 [beep] 
 Hey, uh, call me when you get a chance, will you? 
 Your mother wants to know what your plans are for tonight. 
 Did you happen to check out your groovy little case? 
 I know. It has a little cleaner in there, too. 
 [laughs] Always important. 
 Do we want to get coffee? 
 Yeah. 
 On the way out? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
 [engine starts] 
 Hey, I thought this new contract was supposed to guarantee us separate accommodations? 
 It does. Somebody f*cked up. 
 Could be worse. Could be bunking with Crate or Barrel. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Jerry, what color is your toothbrush? 
 Blue. Why? 
 No reason. 
 Seeing the family tonight? 
 Yeah. Come with. 
 No, I thought I'd hit the Spearmint. 
 Hearing's at 9:00. 
 I'll be there. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Hey, honey. 
 Maddie? 
 Daddy. 
 Maddie, what's wrong? 
 Maddie, what's going on? 
 I'm supposed to-- I'm supposed to tell you that Mom and I are both okay, and that-- 
 Maddie. Maddie! 
 Man : Don't make this difficult. 
 Who is this? 
 Harry. 
 What do you want? 
 Don't call the police. 
 If you harm them, I will tear your teeth out, you son of a bitch. 
 And you-- 
 Harry, what's wrong? 
 What the f*ck's going on? 
 Harry, what's going on? 
 Maddie and Eleanor have been kidnapped. 
 Who? Why? 
 I don't know. Marks. 
 sh1t. We gotta call Vegas Metro. 
 No! No. No f*ckin' police. 
 They said no police. 
 They always say that. 
 Look, until I know what I'm dealing with, I'm not taking any chances. 
 f*ck this. 
 This isn't our town. We don't even know where to begin. 
 I do. 
 [tires squealing] 
 Where you going? 
 Eleanor's. 
 She's got an app. Tracks Maddie's phone. 
 [tires squealing] 
 [horn honking] 
 Just don't kill us before we get there. 
 Clear upstairs. Laptop. 
 Kitchen. 
 Edgar : Clear! 
 Harry, got it. 
 It's password protected. 
 Try AKQJ10. 
 [typing] 
 Zero-1-1-0-0-1. 
 Got it. What was that? 
 Maddie's birthday. 
 Scroll up. 
 Right there. Open. 
 It's a home security system. Rewind. 
 Fast forward. 
 Play. 
 Oh. You M*therf*ckers, I'm gonna kill you both. 
 The tracking app. The pin will tell us where her phone's at. 
 They would have turned it off after she called. 
 sh1t. 
 History log can pinpoint where she was when she called. 
 There. 
 Kyle Canyon Road off 157. 
 It's 20 miles from here at least. 
 It's getting dark. 
 Nice ride. 
 It's a loaner. 
 Jerry! 
 It's Maddie's phone. 
 There's a duffel back there. 
 Hmm. 
 Da-dosh. 
 What the f*ck is this? 
 That? That's a can opener. 
 Saddle up, cowboy. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Yeah, where these from? 
 What the f*ck do you care? 
 I want to know. 
 They're clean, all right? 
 There were used in a multitude of felonies, but not by us. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Yeah, where we goin', anyway? 
 Drop house on Fig. Pick up's once a week. 
 That's tomorrow. 
 And tonight is gonna be fatter than a super gordo burrito. 
 You're crowd control, Junior. 
 Anybody comes near you, lay that fire down. You feel me? 
 Yeah, I feel ya, Mo. 
 I feel you. 
 
 
 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Bosch. 
 Man : Detective. 
 Who is this? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 You tell Marks anyone lays a hand on my family, a single scratch, and I'll kill you all. 
 Burn you to the f*cking ground. 
 Keep your cool, detective, and nothing will happen to anybody. 
 I'm listening. 
 Tomorrow morning after the hearing, Rykoff will be in your custody. 
 You're going to deliver him to us. 
 And if I do that, how are you gonna deliver my family back to me? 
 Do exactly as we say. 
 There is a truck stop just before the California border. 
 Off 15 in Primm. 
 Pull in for gas. 
 Thank the Nevada State Patrol for their escort, and send them on their way. 
 Tell your partner to go inside for coffee. 
 While you fill the tank, certain things will happen. 
 Rykoff will come with us. 
 The ladies will go free. 
 Good. 
 Marks wants to trade Rykoff for Maddie and Eleanor. 
 He's afraid Rykoff's gonna flip. 
 Must be to pull this sh1t. 
 Rykoff must have something heavy. 
 We gotta call Vegas Metro. 
 No. No cops. 
 You don't want to call the local, let's call the Feds. 
 f*ck the Feds. 
 This is my family. 
 [tires screeching] 
 [engine revving] 
 Watch the street. 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 Down on the floor! 
 [gunshots] 
 [grunting] 
 What? Let's hit it. Go! 
 Whoa. Go! 
 Go, go, go. 
 Go on. Go! 
 sh1t! 
 [tires squealing] 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshot] 
 Oh! 
 Go! Go! 
 Goddammit. 
 Marks. 
 His people kidnapped my ex wife and daughter. 
 Now he says he won't hurt them if I turn you over to him. 
 Bullshit, you wouldn't do that. 
 You got one play here. You give me something, anything that gets my family back, or I swear to God, I'll hand you over to Joey Marks in a heartbeat. 
 Who are these mutts? 
 [scoffs] 
 Brothers. 
 Samoans, Tom, Jerry. 
 Call 'em that 'cause nobody can pronounce their f*ckin' names. 
 Where do I find them? 
 Safe house in the desert. Tooley Springs. 
 Sometimes use it for sh1t like this. 
 You tell me how to get there. 
 [phone line ringing] 
 Man : Hello. 
 Lieutenant Lyle, Deputy Chief Irving. 
 Chief. 
 I'm tracking my son's phone. 
 Has he checked in with you yet? 
 He's following protocol, sir. 
 I left him a message earlier today, he never got back to me. 
 No cause for concern, chief. 
 I expect to hear from him first thing in the morning. 
 We're tracking him, too. 
 Thank you, lieutenant. 
 [gun cocking] 
 I can't see sh1t. 
 They're in there. 
 [TV playing in background] 
 [bottle caps clattering] 
 On the couch, front room. 
 Samoans? 
 Yeah. 
 Watchin' TV. 
 One's strapped. The other one I can't tell. 
 [sniffling] 
 I got an idea. 
 [distorted audio] 
 Ah, what is this sh1t now? 
 [banging] 
 Like that's gonna help. 
 I can't see through your stomach, bra. 
 Maybe it's the wind again. 
 Go check the dish. 
 And take your f*ckin' gun. 
 [door closes] 
 [banging] 
 Tom or Jerry? 
 Tom. 
 Who's in the house? 
 My brother. 
 Anyone else? 
 What's he carrying? 
 A .44. 
 [zipping] 
 You move, you die. 
 Get on the f*cking floor nice and slow. 
 [grunting] 
 Clear! 
 We're okay. We're okay. 
 We're okay. 
 [sobbing] Daddy. 
 It's okay, baby, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Whatcha doin', Harry? 
 I'm calling Felton, have him come take out the trash. 
 Okay, wait. Before you do that, can I speak to you? 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. 
 Okay? 
 You got this, Jerry? 
 I got this. 
 All right. 
 It's just-- I just-- I can't stop shaking. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 Shh, shh. It's okay. 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 I don't-- I don't want you to call the cops, okay? 
 Eleanor, you can't let these pigs walk after what they did to you and our daughter. 
 Our daughter cannot be a witness. 
 Not against Joey Marks. 
 We can protect her. 
 No. You're gonna have to find another way, okay? 
 'Cause I'm not gonna testify, and I'm not gonna let her testify. 
 Okay, but you and Maddie have to get out of Vegas by tomorrow morning. 
 And go where? 
 L.A. My place. 
 Until this blows over. 
 [sighs] Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Jerry. 
 Take Eleanor and Maddie to the car. 
 Gotta stop off at their place and get some stuff before we go back to the hotel. 
 Harry. 
 Go on. I won't be long. 
 You put a gun to my daughter's head. 
 [engine starts] 
 [engine starts] 
 [airplane engine roaring] 
 Top lock sticks a little. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 Extradition hearing is this morning. 
 We're on the road by noon back to L.A. 
 I'm home by dinner. 
 Great. I hope nothing happens before then. 
 Eleanor. 
 Nothing's gonna happen. 
 Billets is gonna send some cops to pick you up at the airport, and take you to my place. 
 They'll look in on you later. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Dad, please come with us, Dad. 
 Honey, I can't. 
 No, Dad, please. 
 Honey, I can't. 
 There are some things I have to do. 
 I promise you, none of those people will ever bother you again. 
 Do you believe me? 
 Okay. 
 Now, look, your mother's very upset, and she has every right to be, but I would never knowingly put you in harm's way. 
 I hope you know that. 
 I know that. 
 Just like I knew you'd come back for us. 
 I'll be home tonight. 
 We need to get through security. 
 Eleanor, there's a Glock in the record cabinet, and a 12 gauge on the top shelf in my bedroom closet. 
 I just want you to know where they are. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 [sighs] 
 Detective Bosch. 
 I'm Dave Warren representing Mr. Rykoff. 
 Before we waive extradition-- 
 What? You're not fighting it? 
 Well, what would be the point? 
 You got the murder weapon and you tied it to my client. 
 How it got there and who put it there is a matter for another day. 
 I need some assurances about the security of his transport to L.A. 
 We'll drive straight through, no stops. 
 That's what I wanted to hear. 
 [door opens] 
 Woman : Docket 6-2-0-5, State versus Lucas Rykoff. 
 Thank you, Tess. 
 This matter is an extradition hearing. 
 Is the State ready? 
 The State is ready, Judge. 
 David Warren representing the defendant. 
 Your Honor, if I may, at this time the defendant wishes to waive his right to contest extradition to the state of California. 
 Judge : So noted. Tess, what's next. 
 [traffic noise] 
 Be right with you. 
 Harry. 
 Yes, sir. [clears throat] 
 Uh, yes sir, this afternoon, as soon as he's processed-- 
 Hey. 
 Marks. 
 You ever come near my family again, I'll cut your strings and leave you drooling in a chair. 
 [door buzzing] 
 I don't suppose you're gonna tell me what happened last night, huh? 
 You're right, I'm not. Let's go. 
 Bosch. 
 We ran that vehicle search on Lilliat Saroyan, got a hit. 
 2012 Altima registered to this address. 
 Tony Allen's Vegas office. You lookin' for the car? 
 We found it. Been in our impound for a week. 
 She left it at the Greyhound station. 
 sh1t. She could be anywhere. 
 Oh, we'll process it for prints in case she surfaces. 
 Thanks. 
 All right, detective, remember our deal. 
 Partners on Rykoff. 
 He starts giving up secrets on Marks, I'm your first phone call. 
 Right. 
 Nevada trooper will give you a courtesy escort to the state line. 
 Appreciate it. 
 [chuckling] 
 What are you so happy about? 
 Why shouldn't I be? 
 First degree murder indictment doesn't worry you? 
 Man, I got an alibi. 
 We heard different. 
 I got no motive to kill Tony Allen. 
 Joey Marks told you to. That was your motive. 
 My lawyer's gonna shred that search warrant, and he's gonna shred you, Bosch, for planting that f*cking gun. 
 That gun gets kicked, I'm home free. 
 If that happens, which it won't, then what? 
 As far as Joey Marks is concerned, you're dead, wherever you are, the streets or in the joint. 
 Unless you cooperate. 
 f*ck you. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 Rykoff, Luke. 
 Extradition out of Vegas on a 1-87. 
 Kiko, I want him put on keep-away status, 100 percent isolation. 
 All right, when the sheriff's come to pick him up, make sure they know to put him in protective custody on a John Doe lodging. 
 Harry. 
 Not now, Mank, I gotta get home. 
 Billets wants to see you immediately, as soon as his feet hit the premises, APB. 
 Pretend you didn't see me. 
 I can't do it, buddy. 
 Bring me the head of Hieronymus Bosch. 
 Her exact f*ckin' words. 
 Ah, sh1t. [sighs] 
 Lieutenant. 
 You were just gonna leave without giving me a full report. 
 I need to get home. My family's waiting for me. 
 How are they? 
 Well, they were pretty shaky when I took them to the airport this morning. 
 Well, I can understand. 
 I can also understand why certain decisions were made in haste last night. 
 I appreciate that. 
 But-- 
 Okay. 
 You need to talk to Eleanor. 
 Get her to file on these thugs. 
 Letting them walk is a mistake, and I am compromised because you told me about it. 
 She isn't gonna change her mind. 
 They belong in prison. 
 Look, no way Joey Marks is gonna let those guys skate after screwing this up. 
 They will get what is coming to them. 
 Do you really want the full report? 
 No, I do not. 
 I just hope this doesn't come back to bite us all in the ass. 
 It won't. 
 [sighs] Go be with your family. 
 Thanks, Grace. 
 Dad. 
 Whoa, what are you people doing in my house? 
 Hey, how you guys settling in? 
 In the spare room. 
 Good. 
 Find the towels? 
 Same place they always were. 
 Brought some food. 
 What are we having? 
 Mexican. 
 Poquito Mas. Best Mexican take out in L.A. 
 And I got you a new phone. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 Why don't you go set it up. 
 Your mom and I'll put food on the table. 
 Okay. 
 I'll grab some plates. 
 How's she doing? 
 I don't know. 
 She seems fine but it could all be a front. 
 I got a friend in behavioral, shrink they sent me to last year. 
 You want I should reach out, see if she'll talk to her? 
 Oh, give it a couple of days, see how she does. 
 How'd the extradition go? 
 Routine. Rykoff waived, we brought him back, booked him. 
 Does that mean we can go home? 
 Not just yet. 
 Where'd you find this? 
 Back of the linen closet. 
 Our trip to Catalina. 
 Midwestern girl. You didn't even believe flying fish existed. 
 I still don't. 
 I see you redid the kitchen. 
 Yep. 
 Looks good. 
 So f*ckin' weird being back here. 
 Ain't it the truth. 
 He's runnin' out of the house with his, like, mask askew lookin' out of one eye, runnin' into a wall. 
 His mask askew. 
 [laughing] 
 Robbie, you are so full of sh1t. 
 Hey, you know last night. 
 Yeah. 
 Did y'all f*ckin' bump somebody in there? 
 No, bro, just the ceiling. 
 Gets their attention. 
 Well, is sure as sh1t got mine, I tell ya that. 
 All that f*ckin' drywall dusk up in my nose. 
 That sh1t is f*ckin' carcinogenic. 
 Now, what's that? 
 It's your end. 
 Mm-hm. Thank you. [chuckles] 
 Uh-huh. Oh. 
 Cap. 
 Cap. 
 How's it goin'? 
 It's goin' fine, just fine. 
 How are you all doin'? 
 Can't complain. 
 Irving. 
 I'm told you did real good last night. 
 [chuckling] Yes, you should have seen him. 
 He took out this big beaner like he was f*ckin' Ronda Rousey. 
 Uh-huh. Yeah, thank you. 
 I, uh-- I think. 
 Mm. 
 And, uh-- 
 Thanks for the dinero. 
 De nada. 
 There's good times ahead. 
 Good times. 
 You're the key that's gonna unlock a lot of new doors for us. 
 [chuckling] 
 Just glad to be a part of it. 
 Oh, no, sorry. 
 You're not a part of it yet. 
 I'm not? 
 There's one more thing you gotta do first. 
 We have a little... initiation ritual.
