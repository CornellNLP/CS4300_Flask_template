 [distant siren] 
 [helicopter whirring] 
 Morning. 
 Did you sleep? 
 A little. 
 I made some eggs. 
 I spoke to my lieutenant. 
 You can come to work with me today. 
 Help out. 
 And do what? 
 Kick down doors, join SWAT, grab up some bad guys. 
 Seriously. 
 [sighs] Answer phones, get coffee, make copies. 
 Lieutenant Billets' daughter's doing it, too. 
 And you'll get to keep an eye on me all day at the station. 
 [scoffs] I'm not even gonna be there most of the day. 
 If you don't want to, your mom can keep an eye on you here all day. 
 Is it okay with Mom? 
 I ran it by her last night. 
 Okay. 
 Mom says I should have counseling. 
 Yeah-huh. 
 Well, we'll see how you're feelin' in a couple of days, right? 
 But you gotta eat. 
 No cop goes to work on an empty stomach. 
 You should make yourself some toast, too. 
 Ugh, what is it about L.A.? 
 Is it the air or the light? 
 The way the city goes on and on. 
 [sighs] It can make you feel so lost. 
 I didn't know what was gonna happen to Maddie. 
 If they were gonna hurt her, how they were gonna hurt her. 
 I felt so helpless. 
 Me, too. 
 I was terrified. 
 So was I. 
 I keep kickin' myself in the ass for not anticipating Marks' move. 
 I should have protected you. 
 You can't protect us all the time. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Why not? 
 Something needs to change, Harry. 
 This life, the way we're living. 
 I can't help but think that... something like this was bound to happen. 
 Well, that's not on you, Eleanor, that's on Joey Marks. 
 What we do, Reggie and I, it puts us in contact with people like Marks. 
 It's his neighborhood that we live in, and that puts Maddie at risk. 
 Have you spoken to Reggie? 
 Not yet. 
 I don't know if I... will-- what-- what would I say, I mean-- 
 He needs to know, Eleanor. 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Okay. Gotta go. 
 Remember where the weapons are, right? 
 Record cabinet, bedroom closet.

 Bosch. Shouldn't a dangerous suspect like that be in cuffs? 
 Hey, guys. 
 Meet my daughter Maddie. 
 Oh, that was my first guess, then I thought, no, way too good looking. 
 [chuckles] 
 Detectives Johnson and Moore, AKA Crate and Barrel. 
 Crate and Barrel? 
 Guess which is which. 
 Maddie's here helping out a couple of days. 
 Oh, really? Finally, a Bosch who knows something about police work. 
 [laughing] 
 There's people you can learn from here. 
 These two, not so much. 
 Good to have you here, Maddie. 
 Yeah, second that. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Maddie. Welcome. 
 Hi, Jerry. 
 Don't talk to that guy. 
 Hey, Lis, this is my daughter Maddie. 
 Oh, my mom said you were coming in. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 So, I have some, like, shredding to do. 
 Sure, let's do it. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. How's she doin'? 
 According to her, okay. 
 All right, how about Eleanor? 
 Eleanor is taking a long, hard look at her life. 
 Well, being a kidnap will do that to a gal. 
 Anything else I can do, let me know. 
 Thank you. 
 Jerry, what's new? 
 Layla's visa app. 
 Lilliet Saroyan entered the country four years ago at 22. 
 Single, no relatives in the U.S. 
 Purpose of trip: tourism. 
 You need a sponsor to get a visa. 
 Check out the person/entity paying for her trip. 
 Marina Oresh, North Kingsley Avenue, East Hollywood. 
 That'd be Little Armenia. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Listed Oresh has a U.S. contact, too. 
 Maybe they've kept in touch. 
 Maybe. Bosch. 
 When and where? 
 On our way. 
 Ho-ho. D.A.'s office. 
 Rykoff's lawyer wants to deal. 
 One night in county, he's ready to flip. 
 Wouldn't you? 
 Hell, yeah. 
 What took him so long? 
 Maddie. 
 Man : [on PA] Main 9-3-2-4, report to infirmary. 
 Edgar : The clinic? 
 So the rest of the jail doesn't know Rykoff's talking. 
 He's at room B. 
 Thanks. 
 What the hell's this? Where's his lawyer? 
 He doesn't need a lawyer. 
 Since when? 
 Since he's a federal agent and he's committed no crime. 
 You're shittin' me. 
 Told you, Bosch. 
 You had the wrong guy. 
 You planted a gun on the wrong man, detective. 
 f*ck you! 
 You planted a gun on the wrong man. 
 He's our undercover agent. 
 Task force. 
 You compromised him and our whole operation. 
 I did not plant the gun. 
 If you didn't, who did? 
 I don't f*ckin' know who did. 
 And I don't give a sh1t if he's a federal agent. 
 We found the murder weapon in his house. 
 We have his prints on our victim. 
 And you gave us his travel records, which put him in L.A. the night of. 
 Oh. Beautiful. f*ckin' records are phony. 
 We needed to get him back here in one piece after you f*cked up our operation. 
 Let's everybody just calm down. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 I'm the guy who's gonna tell you how this thing plays out. 
 Let's hear it. 
 Mr. Rykoff's been undercover with the Marks organization, a trusted asset and a vital liaison between Marks and his Russian associates. 
 The Russians bring dope and women into the U.S. through cartel border tunnels, send cash and guns south. 
 They do business with the cartels, and the cartels do business with the terrorists. 
 And any day now, these tunnels will be used to move explosives and terrorists into this country. 
 ISIS and Al Qaeda here on American soil. 
 You get the picture? 
 Yeah, yeah, I get the picture. 
 Why didn't you tell me who you were, what the deal was? 
 I was undercover. 
 You found a gun in my house that I didn't put there. 
 I don't break cover for dirty cops. 
 You callin' me dirty? 
 Prove you're not. 
 f*ck you, Rykoff. And what is your real name, anyway? 
 Man, I ain't tellin' you sh1t. 
 We're not gonna tell you that. 
 It is crucial that Marks continues to believe that Rykoff is who he thinks he is. 
 You're keeping him under? 
 Yeah. I like being lucky. 
 Suits me. 
 Marks gets a hint that we've infiltrated his organization, he will shut everything down, and cauterize the problem. He's done it before. 
 So what do we do? 
 Nothing. 
 At the arraignment, Rykoff's attorney will alert the judge to a fault in the search warrant. 
 The judge'll toss the gun, he'll dismiss the charges, Rykoff will be released. 
 What about us? We have a homicide investigation here. 
 Right. You go about your business. 
 Just make sure you stay away from ours. 
 And provide us with a play-by-play. 
 So we know what the f*ck you clowns are up to. 
 Harry. Come on, let's go. 
 Daily reports, gentlemen. 
 Hey. You want to go to Pechanga this weekend, play some blackjack? You know, celebrate. 
 Oh, that was some ride. 
 Celebrate what? What was some ride? 
 Oh, uh, this-- this, uh, chick that he picked up after work last night. 
 [scoffs] 
 No, I'm tellin' you, man. 
 Junior here, he's hell on the ladies. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Yeah, right. 
 He didn't believe you. 
 I wonder why. 
 You want to go up to Pechanga? Let's do it. 
 Uh, yeah, sure. 
 I got money to burn. 
 Oh, yeah. No, I know you do. 
 All right. Let's hit the bricks, all right? 
 Ah. Another day, another dollar. 
 Let's go. 
 Billets : So, who the hell planted the gun? 
 Why frame Rykoff? 
 Somebody in the organization wanted to get rid of Allen and Rykoff. 
 Or maybe an outsider wants to make Allen's murder look like a mob hit. Rykoff was just a way to do that. 
 What about the wife? 
 We haven't ruled her out at all. 
 I'm thinkin' there's money we haven't found yet. 
 Have you heard anything from the probate court? 
 Not yet, but I've got it wired. 
 Judge makes a move, we'll know. 
 Maybe it's love. 
 What, so she's in love, and she wants Allen out of the way. 
 Not her, him. His girlfriend Layla. 
 What? I thought she didn't care about the girlfriends. 
 Maybe she cares about this one. 
 We have a possible lead to the girlfriend here in L.A. 
 Well, don't let me keep you, gentlemen. 
 [knocking] 
 [speaks Russian] What? 
 Police. Open up. 
 [speaking Russian] 
 LAPD. We're looking for Marina Oresh. 
 [speaking Russian] 
 You have warrant? 
 Just a few questions. 
 I call lawyer. 
 He gets here, you can ask questions. 
 You're familiar with our legal system. 
 [chuckles] American cops can't do sh1t. 
 Your criminals don't know how easy they got it. 
 [speaks Russian] 
 You wait outside 'til lawyer gets here. 
 Hey, you know our system, you know it can take forever to resolve legal problems. 
 Oh, I have no legal problems. 
 You will. 
 Inspections, code violations. 
 Running an illegal business out of your home. 
 What illegal business? 
 Those girls. 
 Friends. They stay with me. 
 This ain't Russia. 
 You can't bribe your way out of it. 
 Ask questions. 
 You vouched for Lilliet Saroyan on her visa application. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Have any idea where she might be? 
 Oh, she left. Years ago. 
 Visa up. Back to Armenia. 
 What was your relationship? 
 Family friend. 
 Like these young women? 
 Like them. 
 Why you looking for Layla? 
 We're investigating a murder, a man named Tony Allen. He was a friend of Layla's. 
 She never mentioned him. 
 What about Joey Marks? 
 You know him? 
 Enough questions. 
 Goodbye. 
 She knows Marks. Must be his place. 
 Part of his prostitution pipeline. 
 Layla started here. 
 Those girls are headed for the same North Vegas sh1t hole. 
 Um, get me some kettle chips and, uh-- 
 Ooh. St. Pauli. 
 And I'm driving. 
 What? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Dude, it's one beer. 
 No, you had three at dinner, bro. 
 Seriously? 
 Seriously. 
 What are you, my wife? Come on, man. 
 Uh-huh. [chuckles] 
 Come on, you should get one, too. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Come on, let's party. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Oh, ooh, get me the, uh-- the 24 ounce. 
 The tall boy. Thirsty. 
 Ahh. 
 Hey-oh, Kaman. What up, man? 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh, let's see. 
 St. Pauli. 
 Of course, no St. Pauli. 
 All right. Kammy, no St. Pauli tonight? 
 Hm, well, you're just gonna have to settle for a Corona tonight, amigo. 
 [doorbell chimes] 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshots] 
 [gunshot] 
 [gunshots] 
 George? 
 George! 
 Talk to me, man. 
 George, where are you, buddy, talk to me. 
 Talk to me, where are you? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Oh, sh1t! sh1t! 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Victor 14, I have an officer down, I repeat, my partner has been shot, there is an officer down. 
 Send an RA now! 
 Man : All units, standby, shots have been fired. 
 Officer needs help. Victor one-- 
 No, no, no, no. 
 f*ckin' dammit! 
 f*ck! 
 You know, we should replace these vanity lights with LEDs. 
 Go green. 
 Irv. 
 We're at an age, we want less light when we look in the mirror, [chuckles] not more. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 At this hour? 
 I'll get it. 
 Wash. I didn't call for the car. 
 There's been an officer involved shooting. 
 I got a call to pick you up and bring you to the scene. 
 Your son's the officer. 
 Is he hurt? 
 I don't know, sir, they didn't say. 
 I'll be right out. 
 Irv. 
 There's an officer involved shooting. 
 They, uh-- they want me at the scene. 
 Hopefully, this won't take long. 
 And I'll be asleep when you get back. 
 I'll try not to wake you. 
 [helicopter whirring] 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [siren chirping] 
 Chief Silva. 
 Chief. 
 What happened here? 
 Where's my son? Who did he shoot? 
 Your son was the victim. 
 The victim? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Where is he? 
 I want to see him. 
 Irv. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 Detectives Espinosa and Coniff, they're-- they're lead on this. 
 Sir. 
 Our deepest condolences, sir. 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [sobbing] George. 
 Oh, my boy. 
 [sniffling] 
 Tell the coroner's people that, uh-- when they're done documenting, I'd like my son's badge. 
 Silva : Of course. 
 [sighs] 
 Security footage. 
 Irv, I-- 
 I don't think that's a good idea. 
 I want to see it. 
 ♪♪ 
 
 
 
 [sighs] 
 District Attorney O'Shea is outside, wants to know if he can come in. 
 No. 
 [siren blaring] 
 All right, as we all know, Detectives Espinosa and Coniff will be leading this investigation. 
 Everybody coordinate with them. 
 Any questions? Good. 
 I'll be turning this briefing over to Lieutenant Lao of the special operations division of IA. 
 What we discuss here must remain absolutely confidential. 
 Go ahead. 
 Thank you, chief. 
 Officer Irving was part of an ongoing internal investigation of plain clothes personnel in the narcotics and vice units in the Valley and West bureaus. 
 This investigation include his partner? 
 Yes. Edward Arceneaux. 
 Over the last few months, Officer Irving had gathered substantial evidence on Arceneaux's criminal activities, and he had just met a group of his accomplices, and participated in an armed robbery of a drop house in Highland Park. 
 How many cops we talkin' about? 
 So far, a handful. 
 Investigation's still in its early stages. 
 Names? 
 He'd identified a female officer, Maureen O'Grady. 
 We have descriptions, nicknames, and audio tapes on the others. 
 All males. 
 When we know who they are, you'll know. 
 With George Irving gone, I'm not gonna lie, we're hurting. 
 We were a long way from going to the D.A. before this happened, I'm not sure where we are. 
 All right. [clears throat] So the situation here, we don't know if it's armed robbery, some gang banger, Officer Irving in the wrong place at the wrong time, or an assassination by one of these dirty cops. 
 What are the chances they found out Officer Irving was working for IA? 
 Officer Irving did not believe that he was under suspicion. 
 How involved does IA expect to be? 
 It's RHD's investigation, but George Irving was our guy. 
 We will assist you in any way we can. 
 All right, so what do we do? 
 What's our first move, do we bring 'em in? 
 I say we wait and watch. 
 If they didn't know that Officer Irving was undercover, I absolutely want to keep it that way. 
 Okay then. RHD will put O'Grady and Arceneaux under surveillance. 
 I want to talk to him. 
 To Arceneaux. 
 Officer Irving... was my son. 
 Uh, Chief. 
 Maybe you and I should step outside. 
 [helicopter whirring] 
 I think he knows who killed George. 
 [sighs] You know the rules, you can't be involved. 
 Espinosa and Coniff are running this investigation. 
 Let them do their job. 
 Don't try to marginalize me, Frank. 
 I've been on the other side of this and I know how it works. 
 You'll shut me out. 
 Go home. Be with your wife. 
 You don't want her to get the news from some reporter. 
 You need to be there, not here. 
 I'll keep you informed, I promise. 
 Can't sleep either? 
 Deputy Chief Irving's son was killed tonight. 
 Walked into the middle of a robbery. 
 Convenience store in the Valley. 
 That's awful. 
 You knew him? 
 Just to say hi to. 
 He worked patrol, Hollywood. 
 Last winter he transferred downtown to a desk. 
 Command track. 
 He was off the streets. 
 Then this. 
 [beeping] 
 Woman : [on radio] All units, this is an end of watch broadcast for police officer two, George Irving. 
 Serial number 37346. 
 On July 24, 2015, Officer Irving was killed in the line of duty. 
 Officer Irving graduated from the Los Angeles Police Academy on November 3, 2012. 
 His first assignment was Newton Division. 
 After finishing probation, he transferred to Hollywood Division, then to Valley Narcotics. 
 Officer Irving served with courage and distinction, risking his own life to safeguard the citizens of Los Angeles. 
 He is survived by his father, Deputy Chief Irvin Irving, and his mother Constance Irving. 
 [no audible dialog] 
 Officer George Irving, the city of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Police Department are forever grateful for your service. 
 They will never forget your ultimate sacrifice. 
 Officer Irving, end of watch July 24, 2015. 
 Good night. 
 [beeping] 
 A police officer was killed last night. 
 Yeah, we heard. 
 Did you know him? 
 Not really. A little. 
 You got your stuff ready to go to Lisa's? 
 I'm gonna drop you off on my way to work. 
 It's Saturday. 
 I'm workin' a case. Gotta go in. 
 I'll get my stuff. 
 Grace'll watch 'em like a hawk. 
 Yeah, I'm okay with it. 
 Makes me feel like the danger's over, and we should just go home. 
 I'm not really sure about that, so just humor me, okay? 
 Stick around a couple more days. 
 I think you just like having us here. 
 [chuckles] Yeah, I do. 
 Give me a hug? 
 Have fun. 
 Bye. 
 Thanks. 
 [water spraying] 
 I'm being tailed. 
 Course you are. 
 What the f*ck happened last night? 
 Your buddy was a snitch. 
 George? There's no way. 
 How the f*ck would you know that, anyway? 
 He worked for IA, and he wore a wire, and you brought him into our group, you dumb cocksucker. 
 f*ck. 
 Okay. So what are we gonna do? 
 You repped up, right? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 I have to make a formal statement on Monday. 
 Tell your rep you want to go IOD. 
 But I wasn't injured on duty. 
 Emotional stress. Death of a partner. 
 That'll delay the hearing. 
 Okay. 
 They'll tell you you'll walk if you give up your crew. 
 Don't buy what they're selling. 
 Yeah. I know how it works. Thanks. 
 Yeah, well, just in case you're tempted, last night's gun's got your prints on it. 
 The f*ck it d-- 
 [quietly] The f*ck it does. 
 Keep your voice down. 
 When you took down the drop house, same gun. 
 Oh, you m*therf*cker. 
 That's right. 
 So you start cuttin' deals, that weapon's gonna turn up. 
 Cops are gonna know... that you set up your partner. 
 [ducks quacking] 
 Ms. Wish. 
 Special Agent Jay Griffin. 
 Need to see some ID? 
 No, that won't be necessary. 
 You've got bureau written all over you. 
 [chuckles] 
 What do you want? 
 Your ex husband is involved in a case that's become entangled in one of our operations. 
 What kind of operation? 
 Counter terrorism. 
 We need him to share his findings with us. 
 Have you asked him to do that? 
 Assurances that people give aren't always honored. 
 So, what, you want me to spy on him? 
 We're only asking for information he should be giving us anyway. 
 [scoffs] 
 No. 
 You resigned from the bureau 10 years ago under a cloud. 
 It was a poker debt. 
 I wasn't a participant in the fraud, it was completely unconnected. 
 I admitted my mistake and I resigned. 
 Well, if you ask me, it was a bullshit charge. 
 And the waste of a good agent. 
 That's water under the bridge. 
 What does this have to do with Harry? 
 How'd you like to get back in? 
 Back in? You mean like the bureau? 
 I assume you started playing poker for a living 'cause nobody else would hire you. 
 And your bureau record's been red flagged. 
 I can change that. 
 You help us, we'll help you. 
 You're gonna expunge my record if I spy on my ex husband? 
 The bureau can't take you back. 
 But there are a lot of agencies out there that are looking for profilers these days, Ms. Wish. 
 [chuckles] 
 Here. 
 Man : [on TV] Police state that shell casings and evidence only begins to indicate the chaos that was last night in Van Nuys. 
 Tough break. 
 Anything new? 
 Yeah. 
 I heard they collected three different kinds of casings from one gun. 
 Nothin' says gang banger like mixed brass. 
 f*ckin' irony, right? I mean, the-- the kid transfers to a desk, and gets popped by some gang banger in a random robbery. 
 It's like those vets coming home from Iraq. 
 They survive that sh1t storm, then they get killed at the movies by some lunatic who thinks that sprayin' the audience with an automatic rifle is a f*ckin' video game. 
 I hear an IA captain was at the scene last night. 
 Yeah, what's up with that? 
 They lookin' at George? 
 Your guess is as good as mine. 
 Later. 
 Hey, Detective Bosch. 
 Pierce. 
 I keep thinking it's my fault. 
 How so? 
 Last year when we pulled Waits over, George keyed in the wrong plate so we could make the stop. 
 I remember. 
 I should have let it go. 
 I mean, we'd still be partners. 
 George would still be here in patrol. 
 He'd be alive. 
 Get that out of your head. 
 He was ambitious, wanted out of patrol. 
 It was just a matter of time, not your fault. 
 Be safe. 
 Man : Sad day. 
 Yeah. Thanks for coming. 
 Yeah. 
 These are the books I told you about. 
 Yeah, I got this one at home. 
 Same edition. 
 It's a new testament in Armenian. 
 Uh, Book of Prayers of St. Gregory. 
 Hm. 
 Your girl's religious. 
 Let me show you something else. 
 You recognize this church? 
 Yeah. That's, uh, Tsiranavor in Yerevan. 
 It's one of the oldest churches in Armenia. 
 What about this? What's this say? 
 Well, that tells you who the book belongs to. 
 Let's see. 
 Our Lady Queen of Martyrs Armenian Catholic Church. 
 That in Yerevan, too? 
 Boyle Heights. 
 Yes. These are ours. 
 How did you come by them? 
 They were in possession of a young woman we're looking for. Lilliet Saroyan. 
 We found them in her apartment. 
 Hm. 
 She also goes by the name Layla. 
 Is she in trouble? 
 Not with us. But she might be in danger with a group of Armenian gangsters in Las Vegas. 
 That's very distressing news. 
 You know her. 
 Any idea where she might be? 
 She said she was moving to Las Vegas. 
 I gave her the books. 
 I thought they might be of some solace, remind her of home. 
 That was, I don't know, two years ago. 
 Haven't heard from her since? 
 She called me a few months ago, in fact. 
 Said that she was engaged to be married. 
 She say to who? 
 She did not. 
 She wanted to know if she could get married in this church, and if I would officiate. 
 I said yes, of course. 
 But then she never called again. 
 You know if she had any friends here in L.A., family? 
 Not that I know of, no. 
 If you think of anything else, or if she gets in touch, would you please give us a call. 
 Of course. 
 How about that? 
 You think Mrs. Allen knew her husband was planning on marrying his lollipop? 
 And take all his money with him? 
 She didn't care about the other women 'cause he wasn't serious about them. 
 Marriage is serious? 
 As a heart attack, brother. 
 That's just what it is. A heart attack. 
 [knocking] 
 Woman : Come in. 
 They're gone. 
 You think they'll be back? 
 You sure you don't want to talk to them, huh? 
 I just want to go away. 
 I spoke with the man this morning. 
 Should be here soon. A few more days. 
 What's taking so long? 
 It's a popular passport. 
 Takes time. 
 Okay. 
 I want to thank you for your kindness, Father. 
 I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't taken me in. 
 I should be thanking you, Lilliet, for your generosity. 
 A token. 
 I could never repay you or the church. 
 When you get to where you're going, let me know. 
 I'll put you in contact with someone. 
 You don't know where I'm going. 
 I don't have to. 
 We're like the Chinese. 
 We're everywhere. 
 I'll drop you a card. 
 [door opens, closes] 
 You lied. To me. 
 The whole time. 
 George didn't want you to know, either. 
 He didn't want you to worry. 
 Don't blame our son. 
 It was his decision, it was what he wanted. 
 None of this would have happened without your blessing. 
 It was a fast path to command track, which is what you wanted for him, too. 
 I wanted him safe. 
 This was a way to make that happen. 
 You killed our son. 
 That's not fair, Connie. 
 You... killed him. 
 Oh, I can't stand to look at you. 
 Bosch : Ice? 
 No ice. 
 Grace call? 
 Yeah. 
 Maddie and Lisa are getting along like two peas in a pod. 
 Nice. 
 I'll pick her up in the morning. 
 How was your day? 
 Not bad. 
 Made some headway. 
 Girlfriend of our victim. 
 Is she the killer? 
 Might be the motive. 
 How was your day? 
 A little stir crazy sitting around here all day? 
 Matter of fact, I was, so I, uh, borrowed the car. 
 Don't look at me like that. 
 The closest I got to being snatched was by the FBI. 
 I was just enjoying myself at Echo Park, looking at the lake, who should sidle up next to me but special agent Jay Griffin. 
 That asshole? Are you shittin' me? 
 What did he want? 
 He wants me to spy on you. 
 What? 
 Feed him whatever I can about your investigation. 
 And he said he would take the flag off my record so that I could start again somewhere else in law enforcement. 
 Unbelievable. What did you tell him? 
 Told him to f*ck off. 
 I appreciate that. 
 Yeah, well, whatever I think about my ex husband, I'm not gonna spy on the father of my child. 
 Call him Monday morning. 
 Tell him what? 
 Tell him you changed your mind, but you want it in writing about your record. 
 Tell him I'm working on something good, something he'll want. 
 And you'll give it to him, but only if he puts the deal in writing. 
 Good evening, ma'am. 
 Sorry to bother you this late. 
 Coyote's been spotted in the highlands, and we're asking all the residents to keep their pets indoors. 
 Have you seen any coyote scat in your backyard? 
 Coyote scat. 
 Um, I don't think I would know what coyote scat looks like if I saw it. 
 Maybe you should go back and check for yourself. 
 Well, this is a nice surprise, officer. 
 What does your lawyer say? 
 When are we getting in? 
 Soon. 
 I told you it'll take some time. 
 What is wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Just tired of waiting, that's all. 
 We're almost there, sweetheart. 
 We're almost there. 
 Okay. 
 [laughs] 
 Are you sure you don't want to stay? 
 Can't. 
 There really is a f*cking coyote out there. 
 Oh. Well-- 
 A coyote can wait.
