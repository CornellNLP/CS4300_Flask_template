 Ooh, smoothies. 
 I need some ice. 
 It's in the freezer. 
 I'm just warming up first. 
 It's gonna be cold over there. 
 You should've started this earlier. 
 I think we have a problem. 
 All right. We can go upstairs. 
 With the ice. 
 There isn't any. 
 Oh, no. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Yeah, Burkhardt. 
 Where? 
 Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin, this is assistant principal Grace Kaplan. 
 She found the body about an hour ago. 
 Says it's Paul Lawson, a music teacher here. 
 He was the director of the music program. 
 I just can't believe this has happened. 
 It's so horrible. 
 Well, do you want to tell us what happened? 
 I saw the car when I came in this morning. 
 It's a little unusual for anyone to be here before me, that's why I walked over to the car. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 Looks to me like it happened sometime last night. 
 He's been dead for a few hours. 
 Car's locked. We kept it that way. 
 Got some evidence inside, didn't want it to get away. 
 Death by rat? 
 Looks like. 
 Oh, God, rats. I can't stand rats. 
 Coroner here? 
 Yeah. Waiting for you. 
 So is animal control. 
 Nobody wants to open the door until you guys give the okay. 
 Fingerprints done? 
 Yeah, we're good to go. 
 Open it up. 
 Let's go. 
 [Woman screaming] 
 Ooh. 
 We also found some cages in the bushes you should look at. 
 Whoever chucked these didn't make much of an effort to hide them. 
 Geiger pest control. We know them? 
 They're in northeast Portland, by the river. 
 According to the assistant principal, Lawson was here late last night rehearsing for a school performance supposed to happen on Saturday. 
 Glad I'm not a ticket holder. 
 Anyone see him leave? 
 Still checking. 
 But we got names of the four students he was rehearsing. 
 Nice house. 
 Nice cars. 
 And bad things still happen. 
 What time did practice end? 
 A little after 10:00. 
 Did Lawson leave with you? 
 No. He always stays to close up. 
 Did anybody see him leave e building? 
 Did any of you see anything strange when you left? 
 Anything unusual? 
 Maybe a car you hadn't seen before? 
 Somebody standing around? 
 We just went to our cars and left. 
 It was late, so we had to get home. 
 We still had homework. 
 Did Dr. Lawson seem a little nervous last night? 
 Maybe a little upset? 
 Yes, but that was, um... That was just Dr. Lawson. 
 We found some cages in the brush near the parking lot. 
 Did you see anybody near there when you left for your cars? 
 What kind of cages? 
 Used for trapping rodents. 
 No. 
 Well, if you can think of anything else... 
 Roddy Geiger went to our school. 
 Who? 
 His dad's an exterminator. 
 Geiger pest control? 
 Roddy wouldn't do this. 
 Geiger's son goes to your school. 
 He did. 
 He was suspended a couple days ago. 
 Why? 
 If this is about that situation, maybe you'd better speak to the school. 
 That's a very troubled boy. 
 I don't think it's appropriate to talk to the kids about him. 
 Nice house. 
 Yeah. Nice cars. 
 [Violin playing  Danse Macabre] 
 Nice music. 
 It's coming from over there. 
 Captivated audience. 
 Roddy Geiger? 
 Yeah? 
 I'm Detective Burkhardt, this is Detective Griffin. 
 Pretty good on that violin. 
 What do you want? 
 Wanna ask you a few questions. 
 You cops? 
 Yeah, we've been called worse. 
 What do you want here? 
 Are you Mr. Geiger? 
 You're here about that teacher dying, aren't you? 
 I heard all about it. 
 Well, we had nothing to do with it. 
 Take it easy, sir. We just want to ask a few questions. 
 Who died? 
 Dr. Lawson was found dead in his car this morning. 
 What? 
 You don't talk to them until I find out what they're gonna do. 
 What are you gonna do, arrest us? 
 You gonna arrest me? You gonna arrest my boy? 
 Sir, you need to calm down. 
 Don't tell me to calm down. 
 I know what's going on here. 
 They're trying to blame us for what happened up there, and I'm tired of them treating us like garbage. 
 Stop. Don't move. 
 Take your hands off of him. 
 Leave him alone. 
 Leave him alone! 
 Stop resisting! You're only making it worse. 
 I got him. 
 I don't wanna hurt you. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 You're a Grimm. You wanna kill me. 
 I'm not gonna kill you. 
 But you keep this up... You're gonna get hurt. 
 Assaulting an officer resisting arrest hasn't made this any better. 
 Now you might think about a little cooperation. 
 Where were you last night? 
 Up in the mountains. 
 A lot of mountains around here. 
 Off highway 26, past Sandy. 
 What were you doing? 
 I catch rats for a living. 
 I don't kill 'em if I don't have to. 
 I turn the healthy ones loose. 
 Can anyone testify to that? 
 No. 
 Where was your son last night? 
 Home. 
 Anybody home with him? 
 No. 
 You can kind of see the problem we're faced with here, can't you? 
 We had nothing to do with that teacher dying. 
 Your son was suspended for fighting. 
 Didn't that make you mad? 
 If it were me, I think I'd be mad. 
 Don't try to understand me. 
 How do you explain the cages being up at the school? 
 They were stolen two nights ago. 
 You report it? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 How many cops do you think they put on stolen rat cages? 
 Those kids at that school know what I do for a living, and they never let Roddy forget it. 
 You know, my boy's a prodigy. 
 Better than anyone at that school. 
 Better than anyone in this city. 
 But that didn't matter because of what I do. 
 What kind of relationship did Roddy have with the teacher? 
 Roddy didn't need him. 
 And he let Dr. Lawson know it? 
 He couldn't hide the obvious. 
 Maybe Roddy snapped last night. 
 What was the fight at school about? 
 They don't like me, I don't like them. 
 Yeah, well, you don't hide it very well. 
 Don't I? Really? That's so sad. 
 Look, I get it. 
 You're the outsider. 
 No one understands the world the way you do. 
 Maybe you shouldn't expect them to. 
 I certainly don't expect a Grimm to. 
 Do you know many Grimms? 
 I don't need to. 
 Okay, so you know all about me. 
 Because you've heard a bunch of stories about me, you know everything you need to know. 
 So if I asked these kids at school, they'd tell me everything I need to know, and it'd all be true, right? 
 Just because they don't know me, that doesn't mean that you do. 
 According to school records, Dr. Lawson reported you for attacking Carter Brimley and trey Harrison. 
 Yeah, I attacked them after they jumped me. 
 According to Marvin... 
 Marvin? 
 That little butter-boy? 'Cause he wouldn't lie. 
 Maybe this thing didn't turn out the way you planned. 
 Maybe you were just trying to scare your teacher. 
 I wasn't there last night. 
 Where were you? 
 I was at a rave. 
 Where? 
 Down by the river. 
 Be more specific. 
 It's an old building on front street. 
 Anybody there with you? 
 Only 'bout a couple hundred. 
 Could any of them identify you? 
 One. 
 Got a name? 
 So you can arrest him for putting on an illegal rave? 
 Yeah. That's my dream. 
 Look, you either prove to me where you were last night, or you go to jail. 
 You're never gonna believe this. 
 I talked to Sammy, the guy who put on the rave. 
 Your perp is DJ Retchid Kat. 
 Who's DJ Retchid Kat? 
 Tell me you know. 
 Of course I know. 
 Everybody knows. Who's DJ Retchid Kat? 
 Only the most famous raver in Portland. 
 Not that men of your age would know what I'm talking about. 
 You didn't know either. 
 Not until I talked to Sammy. 
 DJ Retchid Kat always wears a big cat head, and Sammy is the only one who knows who he is, and he swears it is your guy. 
 So his alibi's good. 
 But not his dad's. 
 Except why would he leave his cages at the school? 
 Not so clever. 
 Unless he wanted us to believe somebody stole them. 
 Then it's clever. 
 Let Roddy go, hold onto the dad? 
 Absolutely. 
 Not to mention, he assaulted an officer. 
 He deserves a little downtime for that alone. 
 You're free to go. 
 What about my dad? 
 Not until we verify his alibi. 
 You know he can't do that. 
 Pretty excited about being let go. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I had to stop him from yodeling. 
 Harper called. Dead guy wants to see us. 
 He died of a heart attack. 
 So the rats scared him to death? 
 Well, they didn't help. 
 But he was on digoxin and angiotensin for his heart. 
 He was kind of high up on death's to-do list. 
 So the rats were put in the car to kill him. 
 If they knew about his condition. 
 But no guarantee a scare like that would trigger a heart attack. 
 Prank gone bad. 
 Yeah, or a threat. 
 Then it's probably Roddy's dad. 
 A homicide occurred in the course of an intentional maiming of the victim, so it's aggravated murder. 
 I did find something interesting in my other autopsy. 
 What other autopsy? 
 Oh, man. 
 There goes lunch. 
 Speaking of... 
 A rat's stomach is like a road map to where they've been. 
 Here we have some undigested bits of your victim, and some colored cloth and nylon fibers that didn't match any of the clothes he was wearing. 
 They were chewing on something else in the car? 
 Probably before Dr. Lawson got in. 
 Take a look at this. 
 Oh, do I have to? 
 It's green and red. 
 Same colors as the music school. 
 Let's find out if it matches anything in Lawson's car. 
 "Rats dine on beloved teacher." 
 That's a little cold. 
 Guess who came to dinner. 
 What do you got on this? Press wants a statement. 
 We have one suspect in custody. 
 Has he been charged? 
 We have enough evidence, but we're not sure he's our guy. 
 We're waiting on some lab results. 
 Well, I got a dead popular teacher at an expensive private school. 
 I'd like an answer before politics screw things up. 
 What are you doing here? 
 The cops just arrested my dad. 
 What? 
 Whoever did this wanted them to think it was him. 
 Or me. 
 That's what everybody thinks. 
 You think it was me. 
 You were the one that got suspended. 
 That was bogus, I thought you knew that. 
 Why didn't you say anything? 
 They're my friends. 
 And I'm what? 
 Someone I used to care about. 
 Used to? 
 Roddy... 
 So now you're with Carter? 
 I can't do this. 
 You still love me. 
 I can't keep sneaking out to be with you. 
 And if you didn't put the rats in his car, then who did? 
 Your boyfriend. 
 He would not do that. 
 Yeah, he would. 
 To get to you, and get rid of me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I thought that this was over and done with. 
 Your father will go ballistic. 
 Please go get in the house. 
 Stay away from my daughter. 
 Stay away from my family. 
 What are you doing here, rat-boy? 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Come on. Do it. 
 I wonder what the police will say when they get here. 
 You're gonna pay. 
 Some of us can afford to. 
 The investigation is ongoing. 
 Because of the unusual nature of the death, we are taking extra measures to make sure that nothing has been overlooked. 
 Dr. Lawson was an important member of our community, and, uh, an inspiration to a lot of young people. 
 His untimely death has caused a great deal of distress, and I promise that every effort will be made to bring the person or persons responsible to justice. 
 I'll take your questions now. 
 Preliminary lab reports just came in on the fibers found in the rat's stomach. 
 Some of them were nylon, the kind found in car carpeting. 
 BMW, Audi, Porsche. 
 You know, the kind of vehicles we don't drive. 
 And neither do the Geigers. 
 The colored fibers are from blankets. 
 There's a Mrs. Jessup here demanding to see you. 
 She's got, uh... how can I say this? 
 Smoke coming out of a lot of orifices. 
 Good luck. 
 Why hasn't Roddy Geiger been arrested? 
 He came to my house and he harassed my daughter. 
 This boy is out of control. 
 He got himself thrown out of school for fighting... 
 We can't arrest Roddy Geiger or anybody without evidence. 
 Well, then get some before somebody else dies. 
 I do not want him coming to my house. 
 Why is he coming to your house? 
 My daughter went out with him a couple of times. 
 Now he thinks he owns her. 
 If my husband sees him again, I'm afraid of what he'll do. 
 That boy does not belong in our school. 
 Or in your neighborhood? 
 Shouldn't you be writing this down? 
 I am filing a report, aren't I? 
 I haven't had that much fun since that drunk threw up on me at the Christmas party. 
 Wasn't that sergeant woo? 
 It was, and I'm meeting him at Clark Lewis for a drink. 
 Wanna go? 
 Don't answer. 
 You've got Juliette, you're in love, you got a life. 
 Go live it, my child. 
 Leave alcohol to those of us who are still searching. 
 Reinigen? 
 They're bottom of the food chain, man. 
 Let me tell ya, the food in their chain? 
 Gourmet is not their forte. 
 But they're rarely violent unless they're pushed to the limit, right? 
 Correct. 
 If you know all that, what are you doing here? 
 How would you feel about talking to a... 
 Reinigen? 
 I'm not protecting anyone for you, am I? 
 Last time I protected someone for you was not exactly a pleasant experience. 
 How is that guy, by the way? 
 Were they able to sew his arm back on? 
 Uh, I don't think he's going to be beating anybody up with it again. 
 Look, you like music, right? I mean, you play. 
 I don't do parties. 
 This kid, he is pretty incredible. 
 At what? 
 Violin. 
 He got a scholarship to the Von Hamelin institute. 
 Is this about that teacher who wound up as ratatouille? 
 Okay, some people think he was involved, I don't. 
 This kid is a stick of dynamite. 
 He knows I'm a Grimm. 
 And a cop. 
 So he's not exactly open to... 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 A heart to heart, I got the picture. 
 You think he'll listen to me 'cause I play the cello? 
 Just so you know, Reinigen and Blutbaden are not drinking buddies. 
 I've never been much of a do-gooder, Nick. 
 The only bleeding heart I ever had was a... 
 I mean, that's in the past. I'm just saying. 
 Look, I was different growing up, and I have a feeling you were too. 
 Monroe, this kid just needs a little bit of help. 
 He's not a rapper, is he? 
 I mean, nothing against rappers, it's just, you know... 
 Where's the melody? 
 
 
 
 Ugh! Damn it! 
 Ugh! I can't get this damn screw loose. 
 How long has this been going on? 
 Oh, since 4:30. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm going as fast as I can. 
 Will you be done tonight? 
 What, do you think I'm gonna sleep here? 
 Aw, crap! I cut my hand. 
 Ooh, I'll get a bandage. 
 I hate this model. It's a deathtrap. 
 Look, it's trying to kill me. 
 Please, please, don't, don't hurt me. 
 Oh, God. Please! 
 What happened? What did you do? 
 Nothing. 
 He just ran out? 
 It looked like he was terrified of you. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Well, that's really weird, isn't it, Nick? 
 Maybe it was the refrigerator. 
 You know, he said it was trying to kill him. 
 Well, now what do we do? 
 Go out. 
 I'm telling you, he's got an instinct for people. 
 Most of the time, he's right. 
 Well, it's too bad Nick wasn't your partner when you met your last wife. 
 That's cold. 
 You gotta learn to say no to temptation. 
 Hey, how 'bout some dinner? 
 I'm tempted, but no. 
 I've got a big day tomorrow. I've got to get some sleep. 
 So you're paying, right? 
 I'll see you tomorrow.

 You saved my life. 
 So how have you been? 
 Busy. How've you been? 
 Busy. Which is good right now. 
 Well, you take care. 
 You too. 
 Hey, Hank? 
 I don't suppose you'd want to save me again. 
 From what? 
 My business meeting canceled, and I've got this great table, an empty chair. 
 Maybe it's time for a little payback. 
 Can I buy you dinner? 
 Yeah, sure. Sounds great.

 No thanks. 
 Ah!

 Now I don't normally do this kind of thing, but we both know who Nick is. 
 And he is not like the other ones we've heard about. 
 Capiche? 
 Believe it or not, he's worried about you. 
 And he knew you wouldn't talk to him, so he thought maybe you would talk to me. 
 About what? 
 About not being stupid. 
 He said you had talent, man, and it's true. 
 I just heard it. 
 And I've been around a lot of people who thought they had talent. 
 Yours truly is one of them. 
 But the real thing, man. 
 The real thing is an impossibility. 
 You don't know where it comes from, or what made it, but it's one of the mysteries of life that lifts us all out of the misery of average. 
 And one of the problems is you people who have it, don't think it's any big deal. 
 That just pisses me off. 
 So the bottom line is you don't throw that away. 
 Is this going well? 
 I mean, I feel like it should be a little more back and forth, ? 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 Just 'cause you're young, doesn't mean you're smarter than me. 
 Okay? So... 
 Basically what we're saying here is, uh, just don't blow it. 
 Man, I'm tired. 
 I'm not used to this intimate one-on-one thing, you know? 
 I know you're probably kind of weirded out, a Reinigen getting advice from a Blutbad. 
 It doesn't ever really happen, but listen to me.

 Hello? 
 This is officer Clay from central jail. 
 Is this Roddy Geiger? 
 Yeah. 
 I have to inform you, your father was injured when he refused to enter his cell. 
 Is he okay? 
 He's being treated in the infirmary. 
 He's got a concussion. 
 No visitors for 48 hours. 
 Maybe you arrested him once. 
 Who? 
 The refrigerator repairman. 
 Maybe that's why he was so upset. 
 Right. Yeah. 
 I didn't even think of that. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Burkhardt. 
 Hey, so I talked to Roddy. The Reinigen kid? 
 And I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I think I made some inroads, gave him a lot to think about. 
 Well, thanks, I appreciate it. 
 No problem at all. 
 I think that kid's gonna be on a little different tack now. 
 Once we got confirmation if the nylon fibers in the rat's stomach were used in German cars, we ruled out the teacher's car. 
 We ran every student registration at the Von Hamelin institute to see if we could find a match with the fibers. 
 I'm guessing half the student body drive German cars. 
 Actually we narrowed it down to just BMWs and Audis that use the nylon we're looking for. 
 But the style is only used in SUVs. 
 We clicked it down from there to a half-dozen students. 
 One of them had a fight with Roddy... Carter Brimley. 
 And he drives a BMW-x5, which is a match with the fibers. 
 Get a warrant. 
 Yeah. 
 Just talked to Sarah. 
 Roddy came over to her house yesterday. 
 He knows we did it. 
 Saying it and proving it are two different things. 
 She asked me if we did it. 
 You weren't dumb enough to say yes. 
 No, but I'm a little bit freaking out here. 
 Everybody knows Roddy is a lot better player than Carter, and the only reason he got the chair is because we got him booted, and so he could be next to Sarah. 
 Grow some. 
 Check it.

 That's what we're here to find out. 
 Then I should call a lawyer. 
 Well, that's your privilege, sir, but you'll still need to open your son's car. 
 Or we'll have to do it by force. 
 This is great. This is where my tax money goes. 
 What do you think you're gonna find? 
 There's nothing in there. 
 That's what they all say. 
 We got holes. 
 Bag it. 
 Holes? What does that mean? 
 What do we have here? 
 Not a chocolate chip. 
 And the color of the carpeting matches the fibers we've got. 
 Sir, we're going to impound your car. 
 What? 
 Tell us where your son is. 
 I'm not saying anything to you till I talk to a lawyer. 
 Well, in that case, we'll have to put a warrant out for his arrest, he'll be taken to central jail...

 Uh-huh? 
 Who? 
 He left with trey about an hour ago.

 Nick, we got a fire at the giger house. 
 You got this? 
 Yeah, got it. Go. 
 Somebody let the dogs out. 
 And I'm guessing it's the same somebody who trashed Roddy's room. 
 We'd better get to Sarah's house. 
 We need to talk to your daughter. 
 Why? She hasn't done anything. 
 We need to know where she is. She might be in danger.

 And make it look like Roddy did it so Carter could take his place. 
 Roddy was better than all of us. 
 Will you tell him that I'm sorry? 
 Maybe you should do that. 
 Guess they're gonna have to face the music. 
 Really? You went there? 
 Somebody had to. 
 You want my weapon? 
 Sarah had nothing to do with it. 
 And she didn't know her friends did. 
 Was this worth it? 
 They deserved it. 
 Yeah, that's not what I asked. 
 They never would've admitted anything. 
 Can't say I ever used rats to get a confession. 
 You're lucky no one got hurt. 
 Except Dr. Lawson. 
 Mmm! 
 How many rats? 
 What? 
 For the report. 
 How many rats do you think were down there? 
 I'm sorry. I didn't stop to count. 
 I'd like to put a million, 'cause that's what it seemed like. 
 Put a thousand. 
 No one's gonna believe a million. 
 Nobody's gonna believe a thousand. 
 What are we gonna charge this kid with? 
 Well, if it was up to me... Nothing. 
 We gotta charge him with something. 
 He took a bunch of kids and tried to hurt 'em. 
 With music and rats and violins? 
 No one forced those kids to go down there. 
 So all we got on Roddy is an illegal rave with five people? 
 D.A.'s not gonna want this, plus they gotta deal with all those other kids. 
 How's a kid do something like that? 
 Well, he was an outsider. 
 He got pushed too far. 
 No, no, I got that. 
 I'm talking about how he got all those rats to go down to that building. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 There are a lot of rats in the city. 
 Maybe they like raves. 
 Hmm. 
 It was a rat rave. 
 Do not put that in the report. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Want a slice? 
 Sure. 
 Oh! 
 [Laughs] 
 Damn! 
 That's not funny! 
 My man. 
 Oh, it's funny if you knew it was there. 
 Chuckle now, but payback's a bitch and she bites. 
 [Toy rat squeaks] 
 This will remind me. 
 [Knocking] 
 Uh, I waited until he left. 
 I-I just wanna get my tools, and I'll be out of your hair. 
 I-I-I don't want any trouble. I-I'm a peaceful man. 
 It's all right. He doesn't even remember you. 
 Uh, what do you mean? 
 From whatever time he arrested you. 
 Arrested? What are you talking about? 
 Isn't that what you're talking about? 
 Look, you're never gonna see me again, I swear to God. 
 What about the refrigerator? 
 They're sending another guy over. 
 Why can't you just fix it? 
 Look, lady. 
 I don't know what kind of games you two are playing here. 
 I got three kids at home. I don't need this. 
 I never did anything bad. 
 He's got no reason to come after me. 
 Please make sure he knows that.
