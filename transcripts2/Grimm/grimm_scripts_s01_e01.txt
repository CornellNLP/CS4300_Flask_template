 Hank, what are you doing? 
 Testing out the new equipment and getting a picture of you while you're still young and innocent. 
 Oh, well, I am getting married once, not four times. 
 Oh, you're a happily ever after guy. 
 Yeah. 
 [Giggling] 
 Detective, what are you looking at? 
 You just bought a ring. 
 That's not what I'm looking at. 
 Come on, don't ruin it for me. 
 No, she wears Armani, makes low six figures, drives a BMW, and is falling for a senior partner at her law firm. 
 Nothing but trouble, Hank. 
 Why can't you just look at her ass like the rest of us? 
 I can't. 
 Come on, Nick. 
 We have a call. 
 The hiker flagged me down. 
 He came through the ravine and said he saw something pretty bad. 
 I didn't know what he was talking about until he showed me this. 
 [Flies buzzing] 
 The rest of her is off-trail. 
 [Birds cawing] 
 How do you know it's a her? 
 Because of this. 
 Normally, we'd be able to tell by the tracks, a bear, cougar, wolf. 
 Which one is it? 
 Well, that's where this gets interesting. 
 This is the only track we found. 
 Hey, we got a boot print down here. 
 We're gonna need a cast. 
 Right away. 
 DNA'll tell us if this is your case or ours. 
 This sounds like what happened a month ago at Munson Creek Falls. 
 Same deal. Hiker and a bobcat. 
 But the bobcat wasn't wearing boots. 
 Do you hear something? 
 What? 
 Music.

 Hank, we got an iPod over here. 
 What's this song? 
 Sweet Dreams. 
 Eurythmics. 
 One of their better.

♪ Who am I to disagree? ♪ 
 I didn't know you couldn't sing. 
 ♪ Everybody's looking for something ♪ 
 Until we get the DNA results, I'll run a database on violent predators in the area. 
 Better search beyond the metro. 
 Absolutely. 
 We should also take another look at that Munson Creek Falls attack. 
 You'll be busy. 
 I'll take the iPod down for prints. 
 Back in a minute. 
 Hoo! 
 Sorry, Nick. Guess I should have worn my airbag today. 
 [Dramatic music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 We've got 23 known predators within five square Miles of the crime scene. 
 None of them rise to the kind of violence we saw out there this morning. 
 Just got a hit on a missing person. 
 University student went out jogging this morning and never came back. 
 [Laughter] 
 She left at 7:30 this morning, and I'm a little freaked out, because she's always back by 8:30. 
 Do you have a photo of her? 
 On my iPhone. 
 Do you know what kind of running shoes she was wearing? 
 Uh, pink Nikes. 
 [Typing] 
 Hard to believe that's the girl we saw this morning. 
 Sylvie Oster, positive I.D. 
 Well, at least we know who she is. 
 Man, what a way to go. 
 Just hope it happened fast. 
 Man, let's get the hell out of here. 
 Yeah. It's been a long day. 
 Big night. 
 Don't blow it, Romeo. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Metal squeaking] 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Dog yelps, whines, goes silent] 
 Juliette? 
 Aunt Marie. 
 When did you get here? 
 Hey. She was here when I got home. 
 Sorry for the short notice. 
 What, you didn't know she was coming? 
 I meant to call. 
 Sometimes I mean to do something, and I assume I usually have. 
 Well, how are you doing? Is everything okay? 
 Not as okay as I used to be. 
 She was telling me some pretty funny stories about when you were little. 
 Dead frog in the microwave? 
 Among others. 
 Come and give us a hug. 
 Here. 
 [Whispers] 
 We need to talk. 
 How bad is it? 
 Two months, two weeks, two days. 
 Nobody knows. 
 But there are so many things I have to tell you. 
 Why didn't you come here sooner? 
 I couldn't. 
 Why? 
 Just listen to me. 
 There are things you don't know. 
 Things about your family. 
 My family? 
 You're my family. 
 Have you been seeing strange things? 
 Things that you can't explain? 
 Oh, I knew it. 
 This is all happening so much faster than I thought it would. 
 When it happened to me, it knocked me on my ass. 
 I couldn't move for a week. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The misfortune of our family is already passing to you. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I know you love Juliette, but you have to end it and never see her again. 
 It's just too dangerous. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 He's here. 
 Who? 
 Hulda. 
 [Roaring] 
 [Groans] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Growling, snarling] 
 [Breathes heavily] 
 Did you kill him? 
 Yes. 
 I thought I'd lost him. 
 They're after me. 
 Never lose this. 
 Guard it with your life. 
 They'll be looking for it. 
 Nick, your parents didn't die in a crash. 
 They were killed. 
 What? 
 I didn't see what happened. 
 I just heard gunshots and called 911. 
 It happened so fast. 
 He came out of nowhere. He had that thing in his hand, and he went right for her, Hank. 
 I had no choice. 
 Take it easy. 
 Now, you go to the hospital. I'll handle this. 
 She said she knew him, and his name was Hulda. 
 I'll run his prints. 
 You want me to come with you? 
 No. 
 I'll be home as soon as I can. 
 Okay. Love you. 
 Mr. Burkhardt? 
 She's conscious now. 
 You saw him, didn't you? 
 You saw who Hulda really was. 
 I don't know what I saw or how you did that. 
 What's going on? 
 We have the ability to see what no one else can. 
 When they lose control, they can't hide, and we see them for what they really are. 
 Look, you need some rest. 
 This is no fairy tale. 
 The stories are real. 
 What they wrote about really happened. 
 You are one of the last Grimms. 
 I know it's a lot, and I wish I had more time, but everything's in my trailer. 
 Sweetie, there's so much you still don't know. 
 Look, what you said about my parents... 
 You're vulnerable now. 
 You need to be careful. 
 Don't ever lose what I gave to you. 
 I'm sorry, Mr. Burkhardt. 
 You can see her again tomorrow. 
 [Rain patters, thunder rumbles] 
 Hey, Nick. 
 You get that translated? 
 Yeah. 
 It means "Reapers of the Grimms." 
 That fits your buddy Hulda. 
 Wait till you hear what I got on him. 
 Hulda was from Boise, Idaho, where he worked as an accountant, but his prints came back as a Mr. Lindon from Chicago, wanted for assault, rape, and murder. 
 But there's also warrants matching those prints in Florida and Alabama. 
 He was wanted for assault, rape, and murder? 
 Don't let the comb-over throw you. 
 This was a bad guy. 
 Hey, Nick, Captain wants to see you. 
 What's he want? 
 Guess you'll find out. 
 If you had to shoot somebody, you sure picked the right guy. 
 How you doing? You holding up? 
 Yes, sir. 
 A first shooting is no small thing. 
 You'll be required to see the police psychologist. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Make sure you do. 
 Get some rest. 
 [Snarling] 
 [Snarl echoes] 
 How long have you been down here? 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 What is all this? 
 I don't know. 
 I'll deal with it later. 
 I'm sorry. Let's go back to bed. 
 How long did you live with Marie? 
 She was my mother from the time I was 12. 
 After your parents died? 
 Yeah. 
 You didn't live in that trailer, did you? 
 I didn't know she had it. 
 [Cat meows] 
 I think it was just a cat. 
 Yeah. 
 [Creature snarls] 
 This is what we're looking for. 
 If this is an exact match of the boot prints, it's going to be very helpful. 
 Thanks. 
 Take a look at the lab report. 
 DNA of the attacker is inconclusive. 
 Still don't know if we're looking for a man or a beast. 
 Well, we got a lead if it wears boots. 
 Based on the plaster cast, this is the boot we're looking for. 
 She's in a deep coma. 
 There was a sudden spike in the EKG this morning, but I don't have anything definitive to tell you yet. 
 Will she come out of this? 
 Well, all we can do is wait. 
 Did you know about the scars? 
 What scars? 
 A lot of them look like knife wounds. 
 They're all over her body. 
 What line of work was she in? 
 She was a librarian. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Yeah. 
 On my way. 
 Yeah, dispater, show 21. 
 We're on scene, and we're gathering evidence... 
 [Sobs] 
 I don't understand. 
 She was supposed to go straight there from school. 
 Yeah, she never showed up. 
 I looked all over the neighborhood. 
 Then I came right here. 
 Will you take care of that, please? 
 What do we know? 
 Little girl on the way to her grandfather's house. 
 Never showed up. 
 That's him, the guy with the beard. 
 Do we know he's clean? 
 No. We're looking into that. 
 That's the best photo they had. 
 We don't know what we got here, relative, ransom, or pedophile, and the clock is ticking. 
 We're gonna split into teams, section off the paths she would have taken from school. 
 Now, it's a mile and a half from the school to the house. 
 When last seen, she was wearing purple leggings and a red sweatshirt. 
 Make sure you have a copy of the photo and the map. 
 You all know your sections, so let's get out there and find her. 
 
 
 
 [Chatter] 
 Captain. 
 Yeah. 
 When the university student was attacked, she was wearing a red sweatshirt. 
 The girl that was torn to pieces? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, let's hope it's not the same guy. 
 She's supposed to cross Hunter Lane right there and then go around the park to Hildebrand. 
 The old man's house is on the other side of the park. 
 Right? 
 Right. 4753 Hildebrand Road. 
 Directly across from here. 
 When I was a kid, I wouldn't have gone all the way around the park. 
 Well, the mother was very specific about the route. 
 Yeah, right. Kids always do what their moms tell them to do. I know I did. 
 Come on, Nick. 
 I'll take this trail. 
 [Stick breaks] 
 You need to be careful. 
 You're vulnerable now. 
 This isn't a fairy tale. Nick, I got something here. Robin Howell. She must have been grabbed somewhere in this area. Careful where you step. We got a crime scene in Berkeley Park. Yeah, off Hildebrand. Hank, we got boot prints here, same kind. He took her this way. Hank, I got him! Where is she? Where is she? Look, I know she's in here somewhere. You got another place to look, we'll look, but we've torn this place apart. What are we doing here? If she's not in there, he's got her someplace else. What do you see in this guy we don't? He's got no priors. He's clean. He fits the profile... he's a loner, he's never been married, he lives across the street from a park. That's not going to get him into a court unless he sues our ass. [Cell phone rings] You shouldn't have come back. Okay, okay, okay. Lighten up. I'm just making a point. Come on. Let's grab a brew. And, by the way, you're paying for that window. You know, I never seen one of you before. I heard about you guys all my life. Never thought I'd see one up close. A Grimm. Ha! What do you know? You know about me? Are you kidding? My folks used to tell me stories about you guys. Scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. How long you been at this? You seem kind of new. Who are you? Wow, you are new at this. What, someone in your family just die? My aunt's in a coma. Ahh, that explains it. What's her name? Marie Kesler. Oh, yeah. I heard of her. Look, I don't want any more trouble, okay? I'm not that kind of Blutbad. I don't kill anymore. I haven't in years. Wait. What did you say you were? Blutbad. Vulgarized by your ancestors as the big, bad wolf. What, did you just get the books tonight? You know about the books? Of course I know about the books. We all know about the books. You people started profiling us over 200 years ago. But, as you can see, I'm not that big, and I am done with the bad thing. Well, how do you... How do I stay good? Through a strict regimen of diet, drugs, and Pilates. I'm a reformed Blutbad. A Wieder Blutbad. It's a different church altogether. You guys go to church? Sure. Don't you? Then what she said is really happening to me. I have to stop it. How do I stop it? Stop it? You can't stop it. It's who you are. So if you just got into this, you must be seeing some pretty strange things. Yeah. I am. I guess that's why you're here. No, I'm here because of the little girl. Still haven't found her yet? No. We haven't. Ah, look at this. You know where she is. Of course I don't know where she is. Did I not just tell you about my strict regimen? So how many of you Blutbads are there? First off, the plural is Blutbaden. And I don't know. We don't socialize much. Bad things happen when we get into a pack. Especially when we see red. So all those things I've been seeing... We're not things. Look, I'm a clockmaker, for God's sake. I don't go around abducting little girls. Okay, then tonight in the backyard, you were marking your territory. I wasn't pissing on my fence for kicks. Then there are more of you around here. Look, you may not know where she is, but you've got a pretty good idea who's got her. I don't bother the other Blutbaden, they don't bother me. Guess what, pal? I'm not a Blutbaden. I'm a cop. And if you know who's got her, you had better tell me right now. Please don't threaten me. I want to know who's got her. [Hinges squeak] [Girl weeps] [Door shuts] [Continues to weep] Don't be afraid. Do you like it? It's all yours. I just want to go home. You are home. What do you say we hang this up? [Humming] Do you want a chicken pot pie? I really think I should drive. No, I'm good. If this is the same Blutbad that killed that woman in the woods... Well, assuming he fed yesterday, he'll be good for a week, maybe ten days, tops. He'll just use the time to fatten her up. Whoa. I got a hit. We're close. Did you really smell him? Dude, you have no idea. Okay, this is as far as we drive. What, he's over there? Oh, he's real close. What's that? Wolfsbane. So he won't sense us. You're kidding me, right? Not if you want to stay alive. What are you doing? Well, you said he was over there. Why don't you just call him, tell him you're coming? This way. Isn't this what the bridge is for? [Groans] Sorry. Do I need something like silver bullets? What are you, an idiot? That's his place. [Groans] What's happening? I can't guarantee what'll happen if I go any closer. It's too dangerous. I might be on your side. I might be on his side. I might even go after the girl. I'm sorry. But there's nothing more I can do. I'm out of here. [Cell phone ringing] What? I found her. [Sniffing] [Knocking] I want to go home. I told you, you are home. Where is he? He's in a house on the other side of the stream. But you have to put some of this on first. What the hell are you doing? So he doesn't smell us. We're not hunting deer. Where's backup? You're the only one I called. What? I already cried wolf once. You think they're gonna believe me? Come on. [Groans] How'd you find this place? Uh, the boots. I couldn't sleep, started looking at addresses, this is one of them. What's his name? Who? The guy we're looking for. I forgot. [Sloshing] [Groans] You do know there's a bridge, right? Man. You better be right this time, buddy. You saw his boot prints, right? Yeah. Up there up by the house. The exact match? From what I could tell, yeah. You run his plates? I'm still waiting. What's the matter? Do you not trust me? Okay, let's do this. Good evening. Can I help you? Sorry to disturb you, sir. I'm Detective Griffin. This is Detective Burkhardt. Do you have a few minutes? Of course. Would you like to come in? That would be great. ♪ ♪ We can sit in here. Nice pillows. I did the needlepoint myself. Not that I tell everyone. [Timer blares] Oh, pot pie's done. Just give me a moment, and then we can talk. Okay? Are you kidding me? Hank, I really believe this is the right guy. Excuse me, sir? Sorry it's taking so long, but you know how delicate crusts are. What kind of work do you do? I work for the Government. Like you. I'm a postman. Not the most glamorous job, but I like it. Where were you between the hours of 2:00 and 4:00 today? On my route. I'd like to know what this is all about. This little girl went missing today. That's awful. You don't think I had anything to do with this, do you? We have to run down every possibility. What possibility could have led you to me? We're looking for a pair of boots. Feel free to look anywhere you want. If this guy had something to hide, he would have kicked us out. I'm leaving. I want to keep my job. [Humming  Sweet Dreams] ♪ ♪ Anything else? No. Thanks for your time. We'll see ourselves out. Hank, I'm sorry. I really thought this time... Wait. The song. What song? He was humming the same song, the one in the dead girl's iPod. [Creaking] [Roars] [Moans] [Roars] Hold it. [Gunfire] [Wheezing] Where is she? Where is she? Grimm. She's got to be in the house. Robin! Robin! Robin! Robin! She's not here. We're gonna have to call it in. I'll find the breaker. Hank! Hank, she's here! It's okay, honey. We're police. I don't know how you did it, but you did it. It's okay now. We're gonna take you home. There's so much I don't understand. There's so many things I need to ask you. Look, I love Juliette. I don't want anything to happen to her.
