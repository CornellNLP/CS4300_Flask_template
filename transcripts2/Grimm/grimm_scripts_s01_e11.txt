 Hey, honey. What's going on? 
 Just got to the opening. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't join you. 
 What do you think? 
 Not really my taste. 
 How is it? 
 See anything you like? 
 Yeah... interesting work. 
 A little Modigliani meets Matisse. 
 Hmm. You're much more of an abstract kind of a guy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I miss you. 
 I miss you too. 
 Okay, I'll see you in the morning. 
 I can't wait to get home. 
 Love you. 
 Love you. 
 I hate it. 
 Too bad. I think it's pretty good. 
 [Sniffs] 
 If you like this one, I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight. 
 Mmm... this piece exemplifies focus on the use of color as a means of emotive expression. 
 By avoiding a more literal transcription of human nature, it clearly comprises the basic tenets of fauvism. 
 Really? 
 [Small laugh] 
 Doesn't mean it's good. 
 [Laughs] 
 Are you a painter? 
 Why? 
 I'm a collector. 
 What are you collecting tonight? 
 Oh, nothing here. 
 I was just thinking about leaving. 
 You wouldn't want to have a drink with me and keep talking by any chance, would you? 
 Thanks, but no. I have to go. 
 Okay. I just have one question. 
 What the hell is fauvism? 
 You're a collector and you don't know? 
 Well, I collect what I'm attracted to. 
 It's a style  les fauves,  which is French for "wild beasts." 
 Loosely comprised of early 20th-century modern artists who used wild brush strokes and bold colors Much like a man trying to pick up a woman. 
 Here I was, trying to be abstract, but I guess I wound up being pretty simple. 
 All successful creative endeavors are simple. 
 So I must have a chance. 
 Wow. 
 I... I really can't stay. 
 Oh, I hope the print didn't put you in the wrong mood. 
 No... it's not you. I'm sorry. 
 Look, I think you just need to relax a little bit. 
 You don't understand. 
 No,  you  don't understand. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Struggling] 
 [Breathing frantically] 
 You know exactly why you came here. 
 [Screaming] 
 [Laughs] 
 Okay, baby. 
 [Roars] 
 Oh! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Screams] 
 [Retches] 
 [Sniffling] 
 Is it working now? 
 Not in the sense that I can see anything. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 It should be working. I don't get it. 
 Can you please just let me try? 
 No, no, no, no, no. All right, how about now? 
 Are you using input or output? 
 [Bang] 
 Oh! 
 [Thud] 
 Oh! Ahh! 
 What was that? 
 We just got egged. 
 [Bang] 
 [Holster clatters] 
 Stay here. 
 No, I'm coming too. 
 No, not unless you have a gun, and you don't. 
 One gun in the house is enough, thank you. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 It's just kids. 
 Oh, God! 
 Run! 
 Run! 
 Yeah, well, they egged our window. 
 They can't... no, come on. 
 They're probably scared to death. 
 Yeah, maybe this is a little overkill. 
 You think? 
 Come on, let's go. 
 I used to do crap like that all the time when I was little. 
 I mean, you're kids. 
 You dare each other to do stupid stuff. 
 There was this really, really old guy who lived on our block, and we all thought that he looked like a troll. 
 So we'd always dare each other to run across his backyard, which seemed really scary. 
 Well, my dad said that he was a war hero who'd been really badly injured in one of the wars. 
 That's why he looked the way he did. 
 Wait, so you're telling me you think these kids think I'm a monster? 
 No. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 I'm just saying that we haven't exactly been the quiet neighbors next door. 
 [Scoffs] 
 No, I guess we haven't. 
 Maybe that's something we could work on. 
 Two Eisbiber kids egged my house last night. 
 You're the monster under the bed. 
 I think some Wesen found out you're a Grimm and they're curious. 
 What's a Wesen? 
 You know, Blutbaden, Fuchsbau, Wildschwein, those of us the Grimms have been trying to eradicate for centuries. 
 Yeah, but you know I'm not like that. 
 Dude, join the misunderstood. 
 Try telling people I don't eat meat. 
 It's like I told you when we first met. 
 None of us have ever seen a Grimm before, you know? 
 You're not real, you're a scary story we tell our kids. 
 "Be good or a Grimm will come cut your head off." 
 Okay, so now I'm on some kind of Grimm grapevine. 
 You're big news in the Wesen world. 
 Look, it's not them who I'm worried about. 
 It's who they're gonna tell and who they're gonna tell. 
 You gotta deal with that before it gets any worse. 
 How's it going with Juliette? You tell her anything yet? 
 [Laughs] 
 Ah! Not quite. 
 Nada? Zip? 
 Diddly? 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 I guess Grimms aren't that brave after all. 
 [Phone rings] 
 No, no. I got it. 
 Death calls. 
 Shh. 
 Yeah, what do you got? 
 Have a nice day. 
 Where? 
 Victim's Ryan Showalter, 28. 
 Stock analyst with Mindel, Brandt, and Zoic. 
 Neighbors hear anything? Any witnesses? 
 No, haven't found anybody yet. We're still canvassing. 
 It's a pretty quiet building. 
 Surveillance cams? 
 Lobby and parking garage. We're downloading it now. 
 Who found the body? 
 Girlfriend, Amy Lewis. She's an actress. 
 She lives here, she had in audition in L.A. 
 She got back around 9:00 A.M. and found him. 
 That's her over there. She's pretty shook up. 
 I would be too. 
 We sure that's him? 
 Girlfriend I.D.'d him. 
 Says he's missing his gold Rolex. 
 She's certain he'd have been wearing it. 
 Said it's registered with the insurance company. 
 The body's completely desiccated. 
 That doesn't happen overnight. 
 When was the last time anybody saw him alive? 
 Try last night. 
 According to his girlfriend, Showalter was among the living at an art gallery opening at 8:00 P.M. 
 She spoke to him on his cell phone last night. 
 No way this guy was alive last night. 
 Hey, I found something. 
 Looks like it was bitten off. 
 Yeah, nail Polish. 
 Must be a woman's finger, but you never know. 
 At least we'll get a clean print. 
 Aah! 
 What? 
 It moved! 
 Must have been a nerve. 
 You want to pick it up again or you want me to give you the finger? 
 [Laughs] 
 That's Ryan. 
 Could be that's the phone call with the girlfriend. 
 How well did you know Ryan? 
 He bought a few pieces from me, but I can't say that I really know him. 
 Wait, who's the woman? 
 I've not seen her before. 
 I remember the hat, but I've never seen her before. 
 I thought this was invitation-only. 
 Yes, but we work from a list that a number of other galleries work from. 
 I can't say that I know everyone on it personally. 
 We're gonna need that list. 
 Of course. 
 She's leaving. 
 He's leaving too. 
 Could be he caught up with her on the street. 
 Maybe they had plans to meet up later. 
 And he didn't want to be seen leaving with her. 
 Or she didn't want to be seen leaving with him. 
 So who was seducing who? 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Sighs] 
 My experience... 
 The woman runs the relationship. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, you two seem to get all the interesting cases lately. 
 Not that I'm complaining. Love the challenge. 
 Well, I can tell you the cause of death. 
 Your victim was made to ingest something highly corrosive. 
 Some kind of acid. 
 What kind? I don't know... yet. 
 But the mouth, esophagus, and stomach lining were all eaten away. 
 Whatever it was completely liquefied his organs, which were then sucked out through this jagged incision here, in his abdomen. 
 And what could do that, some kind of embalming pump? 
 Well, those are usually used to pump things in, not out, but I suppose you could switch it around. 
 Would that explain his overnight mummification? 
 Oh, it might. 
 Now, what about the incision in his abdomen? 
 Was that a knife? 
 More like teeth. 
 It looks something like a bite mark. 
 Literally sucking the victim dry. 
 Are we looking at a revenge killing? 
 Don't know yet. 
 Victim's never been married, so we ruled out ex-wives. 
 Current girlfriend's alibi checks out. 
 Could be an ex. He was a bit of a player. 
 And the only thing missing was his Rolex. 
 We got the serial number from the insurance company. 
 Put it on a hotlist. 
 And what about his financials? 
 Not in debt. Doesn't seem to be a gambler, except maybe the stock market. 
 Well, lots of people lost money on the market, maybe one of his, uh, female clients didn't appreciate his stock tips. 
 Anybody look at our pension funds lately? 
 There's motive for homicide right there. 
 Hey, we got a hit off that finger. 
 Same print turned up at a crime scene in Phoenix five years ago. 
 Phoenix P.D. Emailed you guys their files. 
 Tox reports are on your desk. 
 Thanks. 
 Let's see what we got. 
 Well, this looks familiar. 
 Seems like your killer's been to Phoenix. 
 Victim's name was George Dixon, 25. 
 Last seen at his bachelor party. No suspects. 
 The single print is all they found. 
 Only thing taken was his fiance's wedding ring, worth 10 grand. 
 Could be she's collecting trophies of her kills. 
 A ring in Phoenix, a watch here. 
 Looking at the tox report, the victim was found in a mummified state, just like ours. 
 You ever hear of latroinsectotoxin? 
 Yeah, gargle with it every morning. 
 What is it? 
 It's an amino acid found in spider venom. 
 Why can't she just shoot these guys and keep it simple? 
 Some people don't like guns. 
 Some people don't like spiders either. 
 Well, she's already killed twice. 
 Could be more victims. 
 See if you can find another match. 
 Let me know. 
 All right. 
 Why don't you deal with Phoenix? 
 I'll follow the venom. 
 [Keys tapping] 
 "Traveling on a steamer from Singapore, "I met a Japanese doctor by the name of Hasegawa, "who I was surprised to discover shared my abilities. 
 "He gave me the following scroll, "which described a recent encounter "with a previously unknown creature. 
 I've had several passages roughly translated."

 ♪ 
 [Grunting] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Struggling] 
 Well, if you can't hold your liquor, you shouldn't be drinking. 
 What do you want from me? What are you doing here? 
 I came here to ask you the same thing. 
 Why are you and your buddies watching my house? 
 I... 
 Just breathe. 
 Come on, breathe! 
 None of us have ever seen a Grimm before. 
 Where'd you hear about me and where I live? 
 Hey, Doofus! Where's the beer? 
 You. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 I have three kids. 
 You're the one who started all this. 
 No, no. Well, yes, sort of. 
 But I-I didn't mean anything. 
 It's just that nobody believed me. 
 I didn't know how else to prove you were a... 
 You have a very lovely wife. 
 We're not married. 
 Even better! 
 Please... 
 You don't have to kill us. 
 I'm not gonna kill anyone. 
 Really? 
 Good. That's good. 
 Unless they threaten me or my girlfriend. 
 No, no, no. We... we would never do that. 
 Never. Ever. 
 How many Wesen have you told? 
 Nobody! 
 W-well, hardly anyone. 
 You know, maybe just a couple of neighbors. 
 All right, here's what you're gonna do. 
 You're gonna make sure that whoever you told and whoever they told never come to my house again. 
 Oh, fine. Sure. We can do that. 
 We... uh, right? 
 Of course! 
 You bet! Absolutely! 
 Well, I hope so... 
 'cause I'd hate to have to come back here. 
 Y-you won't have to do that. 
 Not that you're not always welcome. 
 Anytime. Anytime! 
 Good. 
 So we understand each other. 
 Turn-down service. 
 Housekeeping. 
 [Screams] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 
 
 
 Same bite marks. 
 This is a... 
 Piece of dress, maybe. 
 Let's get hotel surveillance, see who we got wearing a black dress. 
 5'7'', 120 pounds. 
 Just like our suspect from the art gallery except for the blonde hair. 
 Little black dress. 
 Same as the fabric we found in his hand. 
 Just got off the phone with the chiefs of police in Phoenix and Albuquerque. 
 They've linked your fingerprint to two more murders in Phoenix five years ago. 
 Victims were found desiccated within a three-day period. 
 Bite marks on each victim. 
 Now, there were also three murders with a similar M.O. 
 In Albuquerque five years before that. 
 Were all thought to be some sort of ritualistic killing. 
 No suspects were ever charged. 
 Three murders every five years. 
 Only two victims in Portland so far. 
 Means the ritual isn't complete. 
 They're also gonna send over a list of items that the killer took from each victim, mostly jewelry. 
 Watches, rings. 
 Look, we want to get ahead of this thing, we need to figure out how she's picking her victims. 
 She will kill again. 
 Can I, uh, give the pretty lady a hand? 
 Now, that is a really pathetic line. 
 Does that ever work for you? 
 Never. But I keep trying. 
 Well, today might be your lucky day then. 
 I actually could use a hand. 
 You can start with that. 
 Ah, the heavy lifting first. 
 Thanks, dad. Come on, mom. 
 We're late. We gotta hurry. 
 [Amused sigh] 
 Good luck. 
 Watch the offsides! 
 Oh, come on in. 
 Caught me making some Baddenwurst. 
 I was feeling sort of homesick. 
 My mom used to make this stuff all the time. 
 You want some? 
 Who's in it? 
 Okay, when my Nana used to make it, she stuffed it with, you know, whatever, whoever was around. 
 Yeah, I think I'll pass. 
 No, but mine's vegetarian! 
 No, I'm good. Thank you. 
 So you wanted to talk about spider poison? 
 Actually, I want to talk to you about spider... Wesen? 
 Is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 We don't really consider them part of the phylum. 
 Personally, I'm not a spider fan per se. 
 I catch one, I wash it down the drain, watch it squirm. 
 But only if I catch them in the house. 
 If they're outside, then live and let live, you know? 
 I found a book, there were some photos in it, but it was mostly written in Japanese. 
 Japanese? That's interesting. 
 [Goop squelches] 
 Don't expect me to translate it though. 
 Ich sprechen  some Deutsch, but that's about it. 
 There's a whole bunch of different kinds of spiders, you know? 
 Some molt, some eat their young, which I consider the height of bad parenting, but as far as we're concerned, they're pretty harmless to us. 
 Well, what about the kind that suck the insides out of their victims? 
 Oh, that kind of spider. 
 You know it? 
 Yeah. 
 I'd say that looks like a spinnetod... a death spider. 
 There's not many of them, thank God. 
 They're like the black widows of their world. 
 I really don't know much about them except they kill after s*x, which, to my way of thinking, kind of ruins the evening. 
 I wish I knew something about their habits. 
 And do they have any rituals? 
 I don't know. 
 Have you searched the web, so to speak? 
 [Laughs] 
 Actually, wait a minute. 
 Charlotte. 
 Seriously? 
 I might know someone who can help you. 
 Yeah, if she's still alive. 
 [Laughs] 
 And when you ran around the outside... 
 And kicked that goal. 
 I thought I was gonna scream my lungs out. 
 [Laughter] 
 Too bad we lost. 
 Honey, it doesn't matter if you win or lose. 
 I know, it's how you play the game. 
 Well, I guess we drilled that one in pretty good. 
 [Laughs] 
 We missed you last night, mom. 
 I know. 
 [Sighs] 
 At least I got to see your game. 
 And... I also got your dad something very nice. 
 Something he's really gonna like. 
 What is it? 
 Wow. 
 This is amazing. 
 Thank you, honey. 
 Ew, you guys are gross. I have homework. 
 Take your dishes. 
 I know. 
 I like your watch, dad. 
 This is too nice to wear everyday. 
 It's for special occasions. 
 You look fantastic. 
 I love you so much. 
 What is this place? 
 It's a  Klosterhaus,  a retirement/monastic retreat home for Wesen. 
 You guys have your own rest homes? 
 Yeah, we're not savages. 
 Except for Schneetmachers. 
 Noted. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Charlotte? 
 It's nice to see you again, Charlotte. 
 You're looking... well-ish. 
 Don't bother. 
 I know what I look like. I'm not blind... yet. 
 Come on in. 
 This is Nick. He's a Detective. 
 And he's something else. 
 He's a Grimm. 
 But don't worry, he's sort of a modified Grimm. 
 What's he gonna do to me that time hasn't already done? 
 I'm investigating a string of murders, and I think they involve a spinnetod. 
 You're helping him? 
 Well, he's sort of new at this, so... 
 I turned my back on who I was years ago, which is why I'm here. 
 How many victims? 
 Two. 
 What did they look like? 
 Mummified. Their insides were sort of... 
 Turned into  dégueulasse. 
 Gut butter. 
 In a way, yes. 
 But you're right. That's a spinnetod. 
 You're sure she's killed twice? 
 In Portland. 
 And three in Phoenix before that, five years ago. 
 And three in Albuquerque five years before that. 
 15 years. 
 Three, three, and two. 
 Yep, that'd be right. 
 Her age would be between 28 and 32, depending on when she first went through  le retour d'âge. 
 The transition. The change. 
 But she'll have to kill again, within three days of the last feeding, to interrupt the mortification process. 
 Mortification process? 
 Sounds like fun, doesn't it? 
 It's really quite not. 
 So what happens if she doesn't kill and the mortification process continues? 
 You're looking at it. 
 Can you guess my age? 
 I'm 26 years old. 
 When she told me that, I thought she was a total whack-job. 
 I mean, I didn't mean it in a bad way. 
 We're plagued by a condition that causes rapid aging. 
 The only way to reverse it is to kill and suck the lives out of young men. 
 You have to understand, this is not something we want to do. 
 We don't take pleasure from it. 
 Tears out your heart. 
 But no matter how much the kills torment you, how many tears you cry, there's no stopping it. 
 The biological imperative is virtually impossible to resist. 
 Was anything else taken from the victims... 
 Besides their lives? 
 Yeah, there was a Rolex watch taken from one of the victims. 
 [Sighs] 
 We're attracted to shiny objects. 
 I don't know why, but we are. 
 [Laughs] 
 You're not wearing any. 
 As you can see, I've chosen a life where I won't give in to temptation. 
 Not that it's always been easy. 
 You two young men look more tantalizing by the minute. 
 Okay, so, Nick, unless you have any more questions. 
 Nope, I'm good. 
 Thank you, Charlotte. It was lovely to see you again. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 She's only killed two victims so far, and if Charlotte's right, today is the third day of the mortification process. 
 Sounds like she's gonna kill again and soon. 
 Exactly. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna stay home tonight. 
 Play a little cello. 
 Um, hold on, read it to me again. 
 Yeah, that's it. On our way. 
 Don't bother to sit. 
 We just got a hit on the Rolex watch. 
 Where? 
 Washington middle school. 
 Excuse me? 
 Principal just called. 
 Ben. He's one of our seventh graders. 
 Took it home and showed it to his mother. 
 She asked him where he got it, and he said he traded it for his Mountain bike. 
 She was very upset, called the school, brought it down here, and as soon as I looked at it, I realized it was a very expensive watch. 
 I wanted to make sure it wasn't stolen, so I called the police before I did anything else, and here you are. 
 And, uh, did Ben tell you where he got the watch? 
 Another student. Sally Marcinko. 
 Sally. 
 Hi, I'm Nick. Your name's Sally? 
 Look, you don't have to be scared. 
 We just want to know where you got the watch. 
 I-I-I found it. 
 Sally, you told Ben that you took it from your father. 
 [Crying] 
 You've got the list. 
 We're looking for rings and jewelry. 
 You catch a look at the wife? 
 Bandage on her finger. 
 Excuse me. 
 How'd you hurt your finger? 
 It's not much of a story, really. 
 We're still interested. 
 I was making dinner while helping with homework while yelling at some telemarketer never to call again and I mistook my finger for a carrot. 
 Could we see the cut? 
 You're not squeamish, are you? 
 [Sighs] 
 Not so bad now. 
 Almost healed. 
 Any other body parts you want to see? 
 I told you where I got the watch. 
 Right, a swap meet. For $200. 
 A $20,000 Rolex. 
 The guy selling it thought it was a knockoff. 
 Can you hear yourself, Robert? 
 Do you know how dumb that story sounds? 
 Just because you keep repeating it doesn't make it true. 
 But it is true! 
 You never thought your little girl would take that watch to school and trade it for a bike, did you? 
 Bet your partner in crime's really pissed at you right now. 
 I swear to God, I have absolutely no idea what you guys are talking about. 
 We're talking about a woman who's killed at least eight people, and that Rolex connects you to her. 
 Now, we know it's not your wife. 
 So tell me, who is she? 
 I don't know anything about any murders! 
 Then I'm done talking to you. 
 [Door opening] 
 Rolex gives you possession of stolen property. 
 You could at least charge him with that. 
 As far as accessory to murder goes... 
 You got nothing. 
 His wife's involved. 
 I know it. 
 I should be back by 11:00. 
 Sally will be fine, Lena. Don't worry. 
 Hey, tonight's about homework. 
 You need to remember why you're here, okay? 
 Whatever. 
 I got nothing on this guy. 
 He's stonewalling and he's good. 
 We got it. 
 What? 
 Something you're not gonna believe. 
 Make me a believer. 
 We got a hit on the wife's print taken from the house. 
 It's a match to the finger that we found on the floor of Showalter's condo. 
 What? How's that happen? The wife had all her fingers. 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 But look at it. It's an exact match. 
 We found our killer. 
 Well, you get to explain this to the D.A. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 I'm gonna let her explain that. 
 I'm gonna take another crack at the husband. 
 I know about Lena. 
 I don't know what you're talking... 
 She's a spinnetod. 
 And now you know what I am. 
 What do you want from me? 
 I know she's gonna kill again. 
 Then you know I can't stop her. 
 I don't expect you to. 
 Where is she? 
 [Lightly scoffs] 
 I don't know. 
 I never have. 
 Spinnetods kill their mates... 
 So why are you still alive? 
 I first met Lena in high school. 
 And you can imagine, she was the most beautiful girl in school. 
 You've seen her, so you know what I mean. 
 And me? I didn't stand out. 
 We had this social studies class together. 
 We looked at each other and we just knew. 
 Talk about chemistry or electricity or whatever you want to call it, but we had it from day one. 
 And it's still the same now. 
 You want to ask me why she lets me live? 
 It's because there's no life for either of us without the other. 
 I'm alive because she loves me. 
 [Panicked breathing] 
 Portland P.D.! We're coming in! 
 Go, go, go! 
 Move! Move! 
 Mrs. Marcinko! 
 You guys go downstairs. We're going up. 
 Got it. Let's move. 
 Clear! 
 Hallway clear!
