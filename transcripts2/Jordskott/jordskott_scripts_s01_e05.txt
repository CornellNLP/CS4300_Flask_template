 Please note: this is a translation and requires more work. 
 Is there anything we can do? 
 She did not respond at our treatment. 
 Make sure he'll stop calling me Daddy. What if my wife will hear it. 
 What the hell are you?! 
 Do you want this? So. 
 You think I kill innocent? 
 Silver Height seems crawling with predators. 
 The family Thörnblad have always acted boldly. 
 You need it. 
 One slightest mistake, and she goes home immediately. 
 Stop! 
 What happened? 
 Eddie? 
 Is he dead? 
 Eddie? 
 Eddie ... Eddie! 
 Anybody, call the ambulance! 
 Help me! Can somebody call? 
 JORDSKOTT 
 Destroy the patch and forget about everything. 
 You know I can't. 
 What does it says? 
 There is some sort of instruction. 
 For what? 
 Yes, some kind of a trade. 
 Eve, you must listen to me now. 
 If the Nature invades you, it will never lets you go. 
 But it concerns my daughter! I will do this with or without your help. 
 What kind of a trade? 
 Yes ... 
 It's hard ... to translate word by word, but ... 
 It means: "You can exchange your daughter's life for another life. " 
 Whose life? 
 The text mentions only "The other girl." 
 Whatever you think about what I said, you need to understand you can't do this! 
 If you make this trade, because of you, someone else will have to get through, what you're geting through What does it say? 
 No. I can't ... 
 I couldn't let you do this. 
 But ... 
 Wait! 
 Olaf, that message is my only chance to find her offender. 
 But then you must promise not to do, what they're asking. 
 I promise. 
 If the change take place, the other child must be clean. 
 Do you understand what that means? 
 Does it say something when they want the change? 
 Yes, it will happen at the next full moon at its highest. 
 Yes, it will be tomorrow at midnight. 
 So, sweetie, Daddy will be right back. 
 Stay there. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Well ... What do we have? 
 Eddie Olsson, the younger brother. 
 He ... fell over the railing up there and ... 
 All right. Was it accident? 
 No, his throat was cut open. 
 The man in the pickup. 
 Damn, we must stop him now. 
 Any witnesses? 
 Yes, over there. 
 Is Wass here too? 
 Yes, he's upstairs. 
 How well are you getting along with children? 
 What? 
 My daughter is in the car. 
 Can you check on her? 
 Yes. 
 Very good. 
 Well ... 
 Who is this crazy person? 
 Perhaps it can provide us some answers. 
 He becomes sloppy. 
 It should be bagged. 
 He must somehow get into here. 
 Or, someone has jumped out. 
 Olsson had company here. 
 Who was it? 
 Esmeralda. 
 I saw her. She was quite in blood. 
 Is Esmeralda have a surname? 
 I don't know. 
 How do you know her? 
 She is from our school. 
 But she's never been there. 
 We would't invite her. 
 It was Eddie who wanted her in. 
 Would you like a glass of water? 
 Does she know Eddie? 
 He was hitting on her. 
 Though I said she's a freak. 
 They said she murdered his foster father. 
 Never believe everything you'd hear. 
 Do you know where she lives? 
 Solbergavägen. 
 What is it? 
 A youth home, just outside of the town. 
 Here you are. 
 Stop, stop, stop... 
 The damn Tree Hugs behind this. 
 They usually don't use that approach. 
 They make flyers and demonstrate. 
 When machines could work again? 
 Hard to say. 
 The damage to the engines is extensive. 
 At least one month if they manage. 
 We can't wait. 
 The forest must be cleared. 
 Then you'll have to get new ones. 
 Is it for the best to do what they want and try to solve it peacefully? 
 No, on the contrary. We'll bring several new pieces for machines this afternoon. 
 I have a meeting with Geo TBS. I'll ensure that they'll give us a green light. 
 We must not respond to threats. 
 Do you understand the risks for our children? They took Anton. 
 I am aware of the risks. 
 That's why we have Storm. 
 He is the greatest risk of it all. 
 Why wouldn't we get rid of him? 
 Storm knows exactly what he's doing. 
 Wee-Emma! 
 You stink! 
 Can I get my hat? 
 Here's your hat. 
 You should go home, right? 
 Wee-Emma! 
 Wee-Emma! 
 Hello. My name is Eva. What is your name? 
 Emma. 
 Why are you so sad? 
 They think I smell like pee. 
 It is not me who smells. 
 That disgusting Snorgeggan smells. 
 I don't want her to anoint me with it, but Mom says I have to. 
 Why is that? 
 Is it a secret? 
 You know, I also have a secret. 
 I am with the police. 
 But ... Why don't you have police clothes, then? 
 Because I'm undercover cop. 
 Promise not to say anyone. 
 I promise. 
 Now when I told my secret, so maybe you can tell me yours? 
 Mom says that goo protects me from monsters. 
 What monsters? 
 Those who live in the forest, who took Anton. 
 Why don't you catch the monsters and put them in jail? 
 I don't want them to take me. 
 No one will take you, Emma. I promise. 
 Go and play with them, they miss you. 
 Goodbye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Damn!! Damn ... 
 You b*st*rd! 
 Esmeralda is lost soul. She never felt loved or desired. 
 How long has she lived here? 
 Since she was little. 
 She was found in the woods when she was two. 
 We don't know who her parents are? 
 No. No one ever show up. 
 Has she ever been adopted? 
 Well, several families have tried, but there were always been problems. 
 Problems? 
 She was accused of acts of violence. 
 She said that she was innocent, but families wouldn't want her to stay. 
 Can you sit there, Ida? 
 What do you think, she was innocent? 
 I've only seen her to make harm for herself. 
 Self-injury? 
 She cuts herself. 
 We have seized several knives here. 
 What kind of knives? 
 Usually, they're kitchen knives. 
 Is anybody know where she is? 
 She is not so popular among the others. 
 They call her a freak. 
 She talks only with one, Linus. 
 Linus? 
 Mm. 
 Hello, Ylva. 
 Goran Wass, national CID. 
 We need your help. 
 Well ... Thank you. 
 Well, such a lively home ... you have. 
 Yes? 
 You see what's happened? 
 Yes. 
 It would get worse if we don't do something. 
 What can we do? 
 They grows on trees directly. 
 Not on trees, no. 
 So you haven't talked to her? 
 No, why should I? 
 Yes ... 
 It seems after all that you are pretty close friends. 
 Mm ... 
 Are you dating? 
 If I was dating someone, I wouldn't want her get into trouble. 
 Nope. But we're not dating. 
 No. 
 But you do not her get into trouble. 
 I don't want it either. She may have seen the man who murdered Eddie Olsson. 
 And she might be in danger. I can make sure she would be safe. 
 I don't know where she is. Okay? 
 All right. But if you talk to her, you may as well ask her to call me. 
 Yes ... I put it there. 
 Yes ... Thanks for your time. 
 Bye. 
 It's Tom. I saw that you called. Yes ... 
 Yes, I know that, but ... 
 Okay sweetie, shall we go? 
 Thanks for your help. Yes. Yes. 
 Hello. Yes, yes ... Yes, but ... 
 You think, she can do that? 
 We had an agreement. 
 Yes, I can be there ... in 15'. 
 It works. Yeah, okay. Hello. 
 Now we only do one thing, then we'll be free. Put the belt on. 
 I'm going to Rissajaure. 
 Petra's lawyer calls. The fact that you refuse talking calls doesn't make things better. 
 Does the agreement mean nothing? 
 It meanы certain rules. 
 Ida should be staying in a safe environment. 
 It won't happen again. 
 With everything is happend and your role in it do you think it is a safe place for a girl with Ida's needs? 
 More coffee? 
 No, it's fine. 
 I need to be with my daughter, and she needs to be with me. 
 But as my advice as your attorney, Ida has to go home. 
 We try again when this will over. 
 Petra never give as a chance again. 
 No. Tell her I keep my part of the agreement. Ida stays with me. 
 It might ok with you but you know what I think. 
 Thank you. 
 It's nice of you to come. 
 We will soon receive a green light from Geo TBS. 
 I have ordered new forest machines. 
 The conflict is escalating . 
 We will respond with kindness. 
 Did you think it through? We don't know what they do if we provoke them. 
 We should stop playing nicely. 
 We can't stand that pressure. 
 We'll smoke out those bastards! 
 They'll regret they ever had it started. 
 Bring your children home. Keep them inside. 
 Do as Storm has said to protect them. 
 Then let Storm do what he does best. Then it would be over in a few days. 
 And Anton? What happens to Anton? 
 Go home and take care of Oscar instead and soon Anton will be home again. 
 That's disgusting! 
 I don't want to! 
 I know it smells bad, but it is for the best. Josefine, calm down. 
 Calm down! 
 We can continue later. 
 You have to eat something, Olof. 
 You've been sitting here all day. 
 I will be all right. 
 I'm glad, that you've got company. 
 I saw Eve Thörnblad was here. 
 What did you hear? 
 Don't worry, I didn't eavesdrop. 
 Maybe you should read a little about the world. 
 You are listening to Radio Silver Height. 
 You don't drink the water, do you? 
 Is Silver Height exposed to a terrorist attack? The municipality says now that it is dangerous to drink water in Silver Height. 
 We have Asta with us on phone. 
 The water's too green. 
 What did you pay your taxes for, unless things are done properly? 
 And then all that murders! You're afraid to go out. What does the government do? 
 The town is in shock. A 17-year-old murdered by  knife this morning at the graduation party. 
 And now the water is poisoned. Things is not right there in Silver Height. 
 This is what she said. 
 I have never heard of it. 
 I hope she knows what she's doing. 
 I know why the water is poisoned! 
 I'll keep you posted. 
 If we don't do something, it will get worse. 
 More children will disappear. 
 
 
 
 Olaf? Goran Wass. Hello. 
 Gran. 
 You had something on your mind, right? 
 A lot, to be honest, but no one seems to listen to me. 
 I like to listen to. Come on in, we can find quiet place to talk . Come on in. 
 It's not the answer we've expected. 
 No, I'm sorry, but the measurement ... 
 Borje, I have neither time nor inclination to be tactful. 
 We need to blow this up, and soon. 
 There are great risks. 
 A misplaced charge would lead to disastrous consequences. 
 The only thing you need to consider: How much is this worth to you? 
 How much do you expect ... to find? 
 A lot actually. 
 I'll have to see it through. 
 Can you do it? 
 It seems that there has been no ... 
 Holmstrom, can you see Börje out. 
 Yes, yes. This way. 
 When would we expect an answer? 
 It shouldn't take long. 
 By the end of the day, at most. 
 That's good. 
 Finally! 
 Gerda ... Call a meeting. 
 Nicklas has been involuntarily committed. They think they should keep him in. You must help me. 
 Come there and talk to the doctors. 
 I can't. 
 I couldn't afford a risk to be seen there. 
 So, you let them take Nicklas away from me?! 
 Listen. Great things are happening here. 
 We are ready to blow up, an open provocation. 
 I need my children to be safe. 
 That's exactly what I ask you! 
 If you have any love for Nicklas, you will be there at 4 o'clock! 
 I'm sorry, Gerda. 
 Here, a little mashed banana. 
 Yes ... 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Yes, we ... were passing by, so ... 
 Coffee, perhaps? 
 Absolutely. Come in. 
 Come, honey. 
 Thank you for sharing it with me, Olaf. 
 I'm just glad that someone takes my warnings seriously. 
 Don't tell anyone. I'll do it. 
 Absolutely. 
 Britta, can you see Olof out? 
 Sure. Come with me. 
 What was it? 
 We're holding a press conference. 
 You think, it's a good idea? 
 Yes. 
 You had no milk, huh? 
 No, unfortunately not. 
 We must find Esmeralda. She might've witnessed the murder. If he finds her ... 
 I'm afraid even to think about it. 
 It can't be her? 
 No, Jeppe and Eddie had found with throats cut open in the same way. 
 Why on earth would she murder a taxi driver? 
 How are you? 
 Well, it's ... a bit difficult now with everything what's going on. 
 Petra want Ida come home. Part of me wants that she stays here for good. 
 Another part of me sees that Petra has a point. 
 But if I let her go now, I don't know when I have a chance to see her again. 
 No matter what happens, she will be your daughter. 
 How did you manage, when you lost Josefine? 
 It was bad. 
 Travelling home without her ... 
 Accepting that I never would see her again ... 
 Luckily I had the job, otherwise I do not know if I would be there today. 
 Ida? 
 Ida?! Ida? 
 Ida? 
 Where is she? 
 Check outside, I'll take upstairs. 
 Ida! 
 The girl is sad. The girl is sick. 
 She is disappearing. 
 This will be our secret. Okay? 
 Ida? 
 Come, we'll go to your dad. 
 Ida? 
 Ida? 
 Tom ... She's here. 
 You can't disappear like that. 
 Oh,  I was terrified. 
 No, we're better ... 
 Shall we go, honey? 
 Thank you. 
 There was no any danger. 
 No, I know, but I ... 
 Eve, if you are so convinced that the girl is Josefine don't give up hope. 
 We will find her. 
 Yes. Bye. 
 Bye, Ida. 
 Goodbye. 
 Eva. 
 It's Gustaf Boren. 
 Is it a right time? 
 No, it's ok. 
 Straight to the point. I want to offer you to buy you out of the company. 
 Okay? 
 You may not want to leave Thörnblads family business to anyone. 
 But I'll take care of the firm - And ensure that your father's legacy would be managed as well as possible. 
 I have no interest to walk in his footsteps. 
 You would do me a favor. 
 Brilliant! 
 I believe Hedman can draw up a contract. 
 Dad, I scored two goals today. 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 Hello. Take care of yourself. 
 No, I want to hear some more of it! 
 Who is Nicklas, Dad? 
 I stand by my decision. 
 Nicklas belong here, where he can get all care and attention that he needs. 
 What you doing to him, you call that a care?! 
 It is for his and others' safety. 
 I respect you as a mother of Nicklas, but that affect your judgment. 
 If you are unable to take care of him at home, I demand that he will remain here. 
 Do you know what he needs? He needs to stay home, get love and security. 
 And who fills this need? Can you hire someone to take care of him? 
 Well, maybe so. 
 Here. Here it is. 
 If Gerda take a mortgage on their house, she can hire someone part time. 
 Part time? It's not enough. 
 Help me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You can not go in! 
 Gustaf! Hello. You must excuse us, but we are having a meeting. 
 I want to have a few words with you, Borderland. 
 Hello. I have some food for you here. 
 Here. So ... 
 We need to save it from now on. 
 What is it? 
 Is it a mountain? 
 There is something below the mountain. 
 I'll be at home shortly. 
 I have some work to do in the office. 
 Make sure that the girls stick inside, it is important. I love you. 
 Buy-byu. Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 He left it in the car. 
 Take it. If everything goes as it should, this would be just a drop in the ocean. 
 Nicklas ... Take care of mom now. 
 Thank you a thousand times. 
 Now we're going home. 
 I'll make pancakes. 
 He has painted his car. We must change the search for a red pickup truck. 
 But he seems to have been alone. 
 No trace of Anton or the girl. 
 You should let someone look at your head. 
 It's just a graze. 
 What were you doing up here anyway? 
 Yes ... The police have looked everywhere, but missed the most obvious place. 
 Thanks for that. 
 What would you have done if he was still there? 
 Tell him to surrender. 
 You would have called. 
 I just listen to my guts. 
 I have a gun. 
 We are in the same team. You shouldn't take unnecessary risks. 
 Call me next time when you're about to do something stupid. Okay? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 That doesn't look good ... 
 Damn, they were fast. 
 Well, I take care of it. 
 We will stop here. Hello. 
 Can I come through? 
 No, you should probably stay where you are. 
 Here we go. Are you in? We will to run at once now. Hello. 
 Hello. 
 SVT. Have you arrest somebody? 
 If we have somebody in custody? No. 
 We run live here in five seconds. 
 We'll arrest him. 
 It's only a matter of time. 
 Olof, here we go - your pie. 
 Fine. Thank you. 
 Is it possible, that Anton's disappearance, murders and the poisoned water have something in common? 
 I want to make one thing very clear. 
 Ulla, you can turn up? 
 The murders have nothing to do with Anton disappearance. 
 And for water - is just stupid. 
 Speculation get our work more complicate. 
 What the hell he's saying! 
 Now I am afraid I have to work. 
 It was Mr Wass with the National Crime Police. 
 We'll broadcast the press conference live. 
 The press conference starts in about 30 minutes. 
 Ulla, see you! 
 Now to Foreign Affairs. Strong criticism ... 
 Wass is here. I can not find Tom. 
 It's not good. He has been already criticized. 
 You gave him the day off. 
 Yes, but he's going back to uniform in this case. 
 Busy. 
 Why, what the hell! 
 I'll call you to f*cking say that you are right. 
 Ida probably shouldn't be here now, You were right. Yes, yes. 
 Can you give me a day? I'm free today, so you can come tonight. 
 There's a train at ten. 
 We will meet you at the station. Yes. Bye. 
 Now I missed the beginning, honey. 
 May I rewind a little? 
 Yes, now we ready to get started. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Have seats. 
 I want to welcome all of you here. 
 Tom Aronsson is not here. 
 Do you have transferred his functions to Wass? 
 Tom Aronsson have to take care of more important things than sit here right now. 
 We are in a very sensitive phase of investigation and couldn't share everything with you. 
 When I am handing over to ... 
 Don't listen to him! 
 Olof ... 
 He knows the truth! He knows! 
 It is a revenge of the Nature. 
 Calm down! 
 That's why Anton is missing. 
 If we don't do something, it will happen again. 
 The balance must be restored. 
 Poisoned water is just the beginning. 
 Why don't you let people know? 
 Calm down! Get him out! 
 Nature has something to say! 
 It is a lie! 
 If you won't  listen, it will be a disaster. 
 I apologize. This was an unusual prelusion of the press conference. 
 We are about to continue. We know Gran, and he's not feeling well. 
 Quiet! Mom is here, sweetheart. 
 Here. Here. 
 Honey, honey ... Mommy's here. 
 Everything will be good again. 
 Yes. Calm, calm, calm down. 
 May I take it? 
 There you are. Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. Come, we're going home. 
 Take the bag. 
 So, honey. Give dad a hug? 
 Take care now. 
 Thank you. 
 I didn't kill Eddie. 
 Can you help me? 
 You were with the national Crime Police to prevent this stuff. 
 I do what I can. 
 And yet it continues to happen? 
 No risk there, that the truth would reveal. 
 People think that Olof Gran is just a lunatic. 
 A lunatic who can force the truth to be lighten. 
 So what should we do? 
 Yeah ... what we should've done already seven years ago. 
 He has become one of the major risk. 
 Here. Here is a nice piece. 
 You have more f*cking honor than someone human ever will. 
 Cheers to you. 
 You don't have to go that far. 
 I could've talked to him. 
 Do you think he would've listened? 
 Yes. 
 Do not forget why you're here. 
 The end justifies the means. 
 Eva Thörnblad she can also be a threat? 
 That's my problem. No one else. 
 So ... 
 It will be fine. 
 Can not you catch the monsters ...? 
 What monsters? 
 Those who live in the forest, who took Anton. 
 I don't want them to take me. 
 No one would've taken you, Emma. 
 I promise.
