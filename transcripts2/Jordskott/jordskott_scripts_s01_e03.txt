 Please note: this is a translation and requires more work. 
 Emma?! 
 Two children of board members of Thörnblads is missing, is it a coincidence? 
 Looks much better. 
 We must do measures before the explosion. 
 I wish we had time for it. 
 Do you recognize him? 
 No. 
 You said you believed in me!! 
 Hold on there! 
 You killed my son! 
 Shoot. 
 Get out of here! Go to hell! 
 Have you decided what to do about Eve? 
 She can't run wild. 
 Emma?! 
 She is gone. It's my fault. 
 I'm on my way. 
 Come on. Come on, Eva! 
 Hold on! 
 It's ok. Talk to me. You're doing great. We'll get through it, you and me. 
 Press it! 
 Come on! We can do it, Eve! 
 JORDSKOTT 
 Why didn't you take her to the hospital? 
 I have no time. 
 Where was she shot? 
 We must stop the bleeding. A rag! 
 Jesus. 
 Quick! Thank you. 
 Come on, Eve. We're doing it. 
 You, stay with me. Stay with me. 
 Thanks. Oh, sh1t! 
 The bullet is still there, it must be removed. 
 Sterilize pliers or something! 
 Come on! Oh, oh ... Come on, Eva. 
 Would be pliers ready soon? 
 The same demands as were before. 
 Leave the forest in peace and you'll get your kids back. 
 We have to stop this. 
 I have a trail. The longer we talk the colder it becomes. 
 I had smeared Emma! 
 Are you sure? 
 I followed the instructions. 
 That means they've got help. 
 But are you sure the mud is working? 
 Their developed sense of smell can't handle it.  
 It shoot ther entire nervous system down. 
 Well ... Who did help them, then? 
 I wouldn't ask "who" but "what". 
 All these things are not as cooperative.  
 I've never seen they worked together before. 
 Come on. Hold on. 
 Hold on. 
 Thanks. Hold it. 
 Are you ready? One, two, three. 
 Devil! 
 There it is, yes. 
 No pulse. What the hell ... 
 Are you ready? 
 Yes. 
 One, two, three. 
 She's lost a lot of blood. 
 Maybe it's too late? 
 You know what we should do. 
 We can't make that choice for her. 
 Otherwise she'll die . Get it! 
 You can do it. Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 There is no way back. 
 I know that. Go on. 
 Come on, Eve. You can do it. 
 Eva. 
 Please ... Don't give up. 
 Save Silverhöjds forest! 
 Come to our meeting. 
 Jeanette, wait. Jeanette! 
 Wait. 
 What do you want from me? What? 
 I have nothing to say. 
 Leave me alone. 
 I heard about your daughter. 
 I'm terribly sorry. 
 But you shouldn't be like this. 
 Tell me if there's anything I can do. 
 You don't need to be a part of that. 
 Come to our meeting this afternoon! 
 Save Silverhöjds forest! 
 Charges are too heavy. 
 Don't worry. 
 My guys know what they are doing. 
 You can't estimate a curb weight. 
 A misplaced charge can get multiply explosive force. 
 Let me do measuring before we rush anything. 
 I appreciate your concern, but we don't have time. 
 Holmstrom has done this before. 
 Made bears sh1t in the woods? 
 You don't need to be worried. You can monitor the placing of charges. 
 So, now you are one of us. 
 This is madness! 
 Everything would be good, Borje. 
 Go, take a look. 
 When would you be ready? 
 We should be able to detonate charges afternoon. 
 Continue to disclose surface. 
 We must find what we're looking for. 
 Do you have brandy? 
 Wass! 
 Eva. Eva. 
 How are you? 
 Calm down, this is good. 
 I'm glad you came back. 
 Hello. 
 Oh, why are you so startled! 
 Nicklas, wait! Where have you been? 
 Baby. Please, open. 
 Has anything happened? 
 I'm hungry. 
 Come, we'll make a breakfast. 
 You can make porridge. 
 No, better if you do. You'll do it a lot tastier. 
 We've talked about this. 
 You need to start cooking for yourself. 
 Mom will not always be there. 
 Where are you going? 
 But ... what if they'll come back! 
 They will never be here again. 
 Come, we'll make something tasty. 
 I'll be right away. 
 I do not understand, I should be dead. 
 Did you see who had shot you? 
 You didn't answer my question. 
 There is no easy way to answer it. 
 We had to give you something to help you heal. 
 You have something inside you, something alive. 
 A parasite called Earth Bullet (Jordskott).  
 It was the only way to save your life. 
 But it also means that nothing would be the same for you from now on. 
 Drink. 
 I know what you gave me. 
 Don't touch me! 
 Why save me if you'll kill me anyway? 
 It wouldn't go that far, as long as you give it nourishment. 
 Josefine ... 
 Josefine is left on the farm all alone! 
 Calm down. Where is she? 
 She is in the yard? 
 Upstairs. 
 You need to recover. 
 I go to the farm. Okay? 
 I'll get Josefine. 
 Sweetie, it's fine. 
 Hello, Tom. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Here, look. 
 Look. And this one... 
 It's from everyone at the station. 
 It comes with a bottle of whiskey, but you'll get when you recover. 
 Then I can look forward to drink whiskey this afternoon. 
 We near lost you. There always should be two officers during questioning. 
 In addition, the hearing should take place in the interrogation room. You broke the two rules. 
 Do you remember what happened? 
 I provoked her. 
 I've had no patience. One minute she was there, the other she was gone. 
 She ... 
 Did you find her? 
 No. 
 But we put out a bulletin. 
 National Crime Police takes over. 
 Wass is  managing all active investigations, so you will have time to recover. 
 I'm fine. I can work. 
 Working means moving, and you're not ready. 
 You may need to talk to someone. 
 I just need to speak with Esmeralda. 
 I need to get permit from doctors and psychologists. 
 I can't just drop it now. 
 Tom, like I said... 
 Get well, we'll see you soon. 
 Bye. 
 Damn ... 
 What is it? 
 I need my clothes. Now, thanks. 
 That'a twist. 
 I wouldn't go closer, if I were you. 
 He is hungry, and he's not so picky. 
 What ... What ... what is that? 
 He needs to eat. 
 We mustn't lose hope, Thomas. 
 We must believe they come home again. 
 Otherwise I don't know how to deal with it. 
 I do not understand how Borén can be so terribly distant. 
 Does he even knows what he's doing? 
 As long as he has majority vote there's nothing we can do. 
 If we go to the police, they put us in a nut house for life. 
 I feel so terribly powerless. 
 If only there was some way to prevent them from start explosion. 
 Do you know what it is? 
 No. 
 Do you know? 
 It's an agreement between Thörnblad and woods. 
 Where did you find it? 
 It was in a secret chamber in the farm, hidden between pages of a book. 
 Your ancestor, Adolf Fredrik's book. 
 Have you read it? 
 No, I could only read a few pages. 
 The agreement is the reason for everything what happens, huh? But how? 
 As you probably already know, Silverhöjds forests hide many secrets. 
 People lives there, people almost like us. 
 350 years ago an agreement was settled between them and your ancestor Adolf Fredrik. 
 The agreement conserve the peace if he promised to leave the northern forest untouched. 
 Your father made himself an enemy of the forest. 
 But your father wanted to restore former Thörnblads lordliness. 
 He became obsessed of the wealth it was rumored. 
 I warned him, but he refused to listen to a crazy bitch. 
 So he began to harvest the north woods. 
 He did something much worse. 
 In 1978 Thörnblad cellulose sprayed north woods with a deadly poison. 
 I suspected the worst, but nothing had been able to prepare me for what I saw. 
 The poison took all living plants, animals, and everything underground. 
 How many of them was died? 
 There's only one of them left. 
 BABY CRY It was a miracle that I found him before anyone else did. 
 They scoured woods to clear away the evidence. 
 The agreement was in the bundle, and someone could find it. 
 So I took care of it and I took care of him. 
 He was in bad shape, but I nursed him back to life. 
 I brought him up as a normal boy. 
 I gave him the name Mun. 
 It means "life" in their language. 
 After all what dad did ... 
 Why didn't Mun strike him directly? 
 He wasn't lead by revenge. 
 To restore Blood Pact between your families, that was fair for Mun. 
 And Emma? 
 Will he hurt her? 
 My Mun is not a monster. 
 Drink. 
 You're not helping Josefine by refusing to drink. 
 Yes ... It's one of the side effects. 
 You become stronger. 
 You will get used to. 
 In 1978 Thörnblad poisoned water by using prohibited chemicals. 
 But what is happening now is something else. 
 It's  evidence that they are be able to do anything. 
 Get out of here! 
 
 
 
 I have something important to say. 
 You all know who I am. But I'm not here to ask to forgive me or Thörnblad cellulose. 
 I am here because of exceptional personal reasons. 
 You can't make that kind of decision. 
 Should I let her die? 
 With all that risk, perhaps it would be preferable. 
 She can be an asset. 
 She is a Thörnblad bound to our cause by blood. 
 So you want to tell her? 
 I'll wait until this is over. 
 Now she doesn't need more information to process. 
 If it becomes a problem, it is your duty to make it go away. 
 Josefine ... 
 Where is Josefine? 
 She wasn't at the farm. 
 May be she went outside. 
 She'd never gone outside by herself. 
 It's Mun ...! 
 You can't go! 
 What happens if the gunman learn you era alive? You aren't strong enough. 
 I can't just sit here. 
 We'll find Josefine, I promise! 
 Ylva ... I gotta go to the station. 
 I found a shell. I must see if it have some traces. You have to rest. 
 Take care of her. 
 Come now. 
 You're blocking the road! 
 Move yourselves! We otto do our job. 
 Come on. We have the law on our side. 
 Even if you have the law on your side, it does not mean you are right. 
 Go home, you dirty hippies! 
 Take it easy, Lelle. 
 I'm calling the police. 
 We 're not going to move. 
 Hold On! 
 Jeanette? Thomas? 
 Are you with them? 
 Consequences would be disastrous. 
 Please Ake, you have to trust me. 
 Does Borén know about this? 
 No. 
 I have to tell him. 
 He would never stop this. 
 You have to believe us! 
 Save the forest! 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, Ake! Dammit! 
 We borrow the Earth from our children! 
 Save the forest! Save the forest! 
 Save the forest! Save the forest! 
 Save the forest! Save the forest! 
 Save the forest! Save the forest! 
 Save the forest! 
 Save the forest! Save the forest! 
 Check this out. 
 Hey, Tom! 
 Nice to see you. 
 Hello. 
 How are you? 
 Well, I'm ok. 
 Hi there. 
 Are you really going to work? 
 Oh well. 
 Hello. Hello. 
 But what the hell, Tom! 
 Easy. 
 Sit down. You're okay? 
 How are you? 
 I have to check Esmeraldas questioning. 
 Esmeraldas questioning, I have to ... 
 Victoria, you ... Bring the camera. 
 I get it. 
 Thanks You. 
 It's okay. 
 Has anyone seen the cassette? 
 Victoria, where's the cassette? 
 The camera is empty. 
 I don't know, it wasn't there. 
 What the hell. Has anyone seen the cassette? 
 What? No One? 
 No. 
 It couldn't disappear by itself. Someone must have taken it! 
 Or has it walked out by itself? 
 Tom ... Come. Come on. 
 What was that? 
 It must be here somewhere. 
 Are you sure you had a cassette in the camera? 
 In fact could you forget, that you put it somewhere else? 
 I do not know. I do not know anymore. 
 Go home. 
 I'll be fine. 
 No you don't. 
 I can't sit on my ass at home. 
 That drives me mad. 
 Sit here, then. Go through the material of the case. 
 DÑ‰ the paperwork? 
 Call it whatever you want. 
 There, calm down. Here comes food. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Neighbors called. 
 You can't shoot in the yard. 
 It is my farm. 
 Go, find whore who murdered my son instead of harassing me. 
 Put down the gun, we'll talk. 
 Are you stupid? 
 Don't tell me to take it easy! 
 Find her and shoot her in the neck!  
 It's the only thing she deserves! 
 Put your gun down now! 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Jorgen ... I found that misfit, but she got away. Old gravel pit. 
 She ran into the woods. 
 Get her! Do it for your brother. 
 Lie down. Calm. 
 Do it. Do it. 
 Josefine? 
 I don't want them to take me. 
 Where are you, Mom? 
 I don't want them to take me. 
 Josefine! 
 What are you up to? 
 You're not ready. Come on! 
 Why are you occupying the forest? 
 It's very important to exploit protected areas. 
 You can poison the drinking water. It's affected all people who live in the area. 
 There are very few untouched forests left. 
 Most of it are production forests. 
 What would you say to Thörnblad industries? 
 What they do, would have devastating implications in all area. 
 What are you going to do? 
 If we occupy the woods long enough, they will give up eventually. 
 There should be a thorough research before explosions to avoid side effects. 
 Is there something bad could happen? 
 Something bad will happen. 
 Don't do anything rash now, Boren. 
 Move on! 
 You must stop! Don't you understand? 
 Stop with this nonsense now! 
 You make it worse for your children. Come ... 
 Don't touch me! Don't touch me, I said! 
 Don't do this! You can call it off. 
 I'll talk to you later. 
 How could you?! 
 You know when you should have drink. The illness you feel because the parasite takes nutrients from you. 
 How bad it would be? 
 It will take over. 
 You will stop being human. 
 You have to know a way to get rid of it! 
 What kills one, kills the other. 
 How many people are there who have it? 
 A dozen, maybe. 
 How did they get it? 
 Some of them sheer bad luck. 
 Some have been forced. Some did it voluntary. 
 Who would agree to do it voluntary? 
 It enhances your senses. You become more observant. 
 You suddenly know about things you didn't know before. 
 You will understand what I mean. 
 Josefine ... 
 She is really bad, huh? 
 I need those. 
 What? 
 Those bandageÑ‹, I need them. 
 It's you who is chased by the police? 
 Don't believe everything they say on TV. 
 What do you need them for? 
 I'm looking for the one who was bleeding. 
 Esmeralda? 
 Search, search. 
 What are you going do to her? 
 I want to help you. 
 We have a problem. 
 Thörnblads did the explosion in the woods. 
 Mun never let the kids then. 
  Can we stop them? 
 Jeanette Eriksson and Thomas Leander tried. They and other activists were arrested. 
 Is it possible to contact Mun? 
 Flights to Mun to deliver of a message. 
 It is urgent! 
 Come on, VÃrdur, flight. 
 Sit here. 
 Eve, it's time. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 I told you we're not on vacation. 
 Over here. I brought some things to you. 
 Thanks. 
 And this. 
 I'm so hungry. 
 It is cold. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 This is for you. 
 Thanks! 
 The accident occurred today is awfully regrettable. 
 The injured workers would of course substitute for what's happened. 
 We should be extra careful so it won't happen again. 
 Jeanette Eriksson and Thomas Leander was arrested by police at the demonstration. 
 What do you have to say about it? 
 If that's right, I would say this ... 
 No parent should have to go through the horror of losing a child. 
 None of us, Thörnblad cellulose, accusing them of their actions. 
 It's just unfortunate that they choose to cope with their grief in this way. 
 Linus? 
 It is not fun! 
 People like you disgust me! You hide among us thinking that we don't see. 
 But I know what you are, your monsters. 
 I want to know where kids are. 
 You know who took them. 
 I don't know! 
 Don't lie to me! 
 It's my job to ensure that the world is free of such monsters as you. 
 You kill innocent human children. 
 You have no business here. 
 Where are the children? Answer me! 
 What do you do? Stop ... Stop! 
 Cuba ... 
 Cuba? 
 No no! 
 Yes, Cuba. I've got you. 
 What the hell are you doing here?! Stop! Stop! 
 But what the hell ... 
 "A malady ..." ... 
 "That not even the doctors ..." ... 
 "'had seen before." 
 "At first we thought it was the plague."
