 Please note: this is a translation and requires more work. 
 You and your father were not close. 
 My father was very ill. I guess he wanted to die in his own terms. 
 Haven't seen you for  seven years, since your daughter disappeared. 
 I think Anton has been kidnapped by the same offender who took your daughter. 
 Do your research, I will have mine. 
 We'll find him.  
 We didn't see him since he got sick. 
 No need to explain. 
 Wait here. 
 Does this work?  
 You know what the requirements are. 
 Of course.  
 Then we'll do it my way. 
 I've been using this for seven years. A Josefine fell before disappearing. 
 Josefine. 
 No, no, no, Eva!  
 I'm going to see my daughter! 
 She can not have visitors. 
 What dogs found ... what will ... 
 May be Anton. 
 Oscar! Are you sitting there? 
 We are supposed to have breakfast. Come on. 
 Anton want to come home.  
 Me too. He will come soon. 
 Anton want to come home now. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? Anyone there? Hi! 
 Hello ... Eva. Pekka Koljonen.  Do not know if you remember me. 
 The last time we saw, I had rubella. 
 I am truly sorry for your loss. Your father was a patient for me. 
 Follow Me. 
 If you missed and should have found him. 
 Instead, we should try to find the kidnapper. 
 Nothing suggests a kidnapping.  
 We raked all Silverhöjd! 
 They want to squeeze money from Thomas.  
 It's a possibility we examine. 
 But in that case, the hijackers would be released long ago. 
 Yeah ... I do not know. We'll have to think about. 
 Think how?  
 In large. 
 In large. How Come? 
 We must look to those who have been in contact with the girl, although nothing says she spreading something. 
 How is she?  
 No change, but stable. 
 I played some ground in the forest. 
 That's cow parsnip.  The sap has that effect. 
 No danger. With compresses, is likely to be cured in two weeks. 
 I found a bottle of morphine that my father was taking. 
 It hurt a lot, but small daily doses relieve the pain. 
 You were with him in the farm?  
 Yes I did not want to leave the house.. 
 Have you seen someone else when you were there? 
 It was long since the last time, and Johan did not get me in recent years. 
 Although he was sick?  
 Yes. 
 I tried to explain him what it should be ... but he didn't  listen. 
 Then you hear me when I have the remedy. 
 It's nothing to worry.  I'll get a compress. 
 But ... he did not try anything? chemotherapy or radiotherapy? 
 Is that what you heard?  That your father had cancer? 
 And you didn't see who was?  
 No. I heard someone behind the door. 
 Then I looked and there was nobody. He was not there. 
 Anything else suspicious? Has anyone called? 
 No, I should not have called them, but ... I was so afraid that ... 
 You did everything right, Lina. 
 Sorry. 
 If something happen, call me? Anytime. 
 And a give a Oscar. 
 I apologize. She has been a little ... frail, since Anton disappeared. 
 Someone was here and tried to get in the house. You are not worried? 
 In fact, it could have been anyone. 
 Ten days without a sign. It is increasingly like that someone took him. 
 One question ... 
 No, I have not. 
 Mmm ... Yeah ... 
 I've done everything you asked.  What else would you like to do? 
 I know, but hell I did not get it, I tell you! 
 Sorry.  
 Teddy Bear Anton came home. 
 Hello, Oscar. Sorry, what did you say?  
 Teddy Anton knocked on the door. 
 You can not run that way. Come on. 
 I suspect that is a parasitic disease that attacks the cells and controls. 
 There is a cure?  
 I never got that far. 
 But now it seems, unfortunately, I have a second chance. 
 The girl suffers from the same?  
 We need more detailed samples. 
 But ... yes, it seems that yes, I'm afraid.  
 What if there is a cure? 
 Seeing what we found with the blood of your father ... See for yourself. 
 The parasite feeds on blood. 
 Growth slowed while, probably due to nutritional deficiencies. 
 In one experiment, added a few drops of water. The effect can be seen there. 
 Is there anyone who wants to get to you through Anton? 
 I do not know ... no. 
 If you know something, say so. 
 We can not help if you do not help us. 
 I just want to go home Anton.  
 Yes, that's what we all want. 
 It was really nice to meet you again, despite the circumstances. 
 You can always come here if anything happens. OK? 
 Hey ... if dad refused to see, does no one took care of him? 
 Gerda, his secretary, was usually there. 
 Gerda Gunnarsson? Are you sure?  
 Yes, she who was visiting. 
 Sorry! 
 Is everything okay? 
 You need it. 
 No thanks. 
 No thanks! 
 Hello? 
 Nicklas! To scare people when you look well. 
 Sorry, Mom. 
 Sorry. 
 He shot a boar yesterday. 
 I'm so glad you came. 
 You visited my father often, huh?  When I was sick. 
 Why don't we go and take a cup of coffee?  Blowing much. 
 I have also baked buns. 
 Foolishly, I did not tell you how it went. Do not want to give the wrong impression. 
 You were the reason for the divorce of my parents, so ... 
 We need to talk a little. 
 We were just friends. 
 That little story, the ... 
 Our small matter, that ... 
 It sold out before you and your mom left Silverhöjd. 
 Now I helped him clean, wash and handled with practical things. 
 Excuse me, Milk?  
 Yes. 
 Did you see someone else being there?  
 No. He did not want visitors. 
 As soon as I arrived, he locked himself in his study. 
 He became very different after being ill. 
 Introverted and dark. 
 There was something that bothered him, unrelated to the disease. 
 What? 
 I've never understood what it was. 
 Beautiful necklace. it was Josefine's. 
 Was you who found him? 
 I saw the fire, so I called. 
 But it was only when the fire was extinct... that they found him. 
 Thank you for taking care of him. 
 I wish... I had gotten there earlier, but it is what it is. 
 Monday, 23rd of May. Now I'm getting worse. 
 Blood pressure is at 110/65. I'm so thirsty. 
 Friday, June the 10th. 
 Blood pressure is 112/60. 
 I mustn't drink, remember it! Of course I remember. 
 I've made preliminary aerial geophysical surveys of the area... and I strongly recommend not to intervene. 
 Gustaf, I need to speak with you. 
 Like I said, all Silverhöjd seems to be above mined ground. 
 The slightest activity could cause a shift... 
 Those sinkholes exist due to years of erosion... and intervening could worsen them. 
 Much, much worse. We're talking massive disaster. 
 Gustaf, I need to speak with you. 
 How the hell can you be so stupid? 
 Lina called the police. I was lucky to get there in time. 
 What did you tell her? 
 How this works. 
 That Anton's life is in danger if she speaks out. Lina didn't tell them anything. 
 We must keep the police out. 
 But, what if they find it? 
 Well, what do you think will happen? 
 Then the police will expose Anton to a bigger danger, is that what you want? 
 Can we refuse his demands? 
 You know what's at stake here. 
 We want the problem gone for good, and we have the solution. 
 My friend ... 
 Try to be patient. We will make sure Anton comes home again. 
 Have you ditched the teddy bear? 
 No. 
 Make sure it disappears. We don't want it to falling into the wrong hands. 
 Thursday. is it Thursday? 
 No. It's Friday. 
 I really shouldn't even be sitting here. 
 How long will this continue? 
 What's that? 
 I can't feel my pulse at all. 
 It feels as if it was... growing in here. Inside. 
 It keeps on weakening me, crawling from the inside out. 
 I must hurry now, before it's too late. 
 If only Eva would talk to me. 
 
 
 
 Hello. 
 I'm not taking any travelers. 
 And I'm not traveling. 
 What do you want then? 
 Tell me where did you take Olof Gran. 
 I could but I won't. 
 Why not? 
 I see no reason. 
 You could see one, if you wanted to. 
 I drove him to the ferry station, as usual. 
 He tends to take the ferry to Bräckö. 
 Bräckö? 
 It's closed! 
 Jeppe, I didn't see it was you. 
 But you could see the king in the bills. 
 This is private property! 
 We have to talk. I've got your book. 
 Bottoms up. Sit. 
 What's this? 
 Just some scribbles, stuff I do when I'm bored. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 You were one of the few who didn't believe that Josefine drowned. 
 That's right. I've always believed that she didn't drown. 
 You think someone took her?  
 Yes. 
 But I do not think it was coincidence that your daughter just disappeared. 
 What do you mean? 
 The Thornblad family has always been at the center of the scene. 
 For better or for worse. 
 Do you think my father had to do with the disappearance? 
 Time to go!  
 Wait! I think he's right. 
 Hey, I'll take the whole box. 
 Really? Okay, then. 
 Thanks for this. 
 As I suspected your father, I encountered resistance everywhere. 
 I was the fool ... who will accuse Johan Thornblad, your father, hero of Silverhöjd. 
 What made ​​you suspect him?  
 This. 
 The dress of Josefine? 
 The day after the disappearance thoroughly dredged the lake ... but found nothing. 
 I know, I was there. 
 Six months later, by order of the then police chief Halberstad, was dredged again. 
 Then suddenly appeared this. 
 I started to dig a little of that ... and it turned out it was your father who claimed a new dredging. 
 Do you think he planted the dress? 
 I could never prove it. When I tried, I was fired from the police. 
 Why Dad would take Josefine?  
 Probably wasn't him. 
 But on the other hand, I think he knew who who took her. 
 Your father became an enemy of the forest. 
 Jeppe! 
 Are you serious? 
 Why you think the forest of Silverhöjd remained intact? 
 Intact until your father took charge. 
 And a child is missing. That can't be a good sign. 
 There are forces in nature that can be dangerous if you wrong them. 
 Yes, believe what you want... but it's not safe for you here. do you know what this is? 
 Where did you get that? 
 It was in the farm. Can you read it? 
 I've only seen fragments and some runes here and there. 
 I'll do my best. 
 Thanks. 
 Do we have a name? 
 Jeppe. 
 Last name? 
 Known only as Jeppe. 
 He's always driven a taxi in the city. 
 Any witnesses? 
 The store owner, in the ambulance. 
 Keep the press and people away. 
 Remove that camera! 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Wass, police. Can we ask you a few questions? 
 Hello. My name's Tom Aronsson. Did you see what happened? 
 How well did you know him? 
 He used to come by every once in a while and we spoke about the weather. 
 Any relatives? 
 No, he used to live alone in a caravan outside the city. 
 We have a name. Bergman. 
 We have to find relatives. Have the experts look everywhere. 
 Wait! Come. 
 Did you find something about him? 
 No. He's not in Silverhöjd's record. 
 What about the taxi company? 
 There's no taxi company. 
 According to the records it closed in 1989. 
 How the hell could we not see it? 
 He hasn't been suspected for anything. 
 So he didn't get his throat cut? 
 Tom... Wouldn't you like to go home and get some sleep? 
 How could I sleep? Anton is missing and now this! 
 Could this taxi driver have taken Anton? 
 We'll see what the experts find. 
 Yes. I give up for today. 
 Sleep, just sleep. Winter will be ours. 
 The powerful spells heal the soil's wounds. 
 Tree crowns swelling, fir, and pine vein. donate their resin, the fairest crystal... 
 Dad? 
 Return to serenity. 
 What have you done to Josefine? 
 Written in Blood. 
 Dad... 
 Everything has a purpose. 
 Dad! 
 Deep beneath the earth. 
 What have you done to Josefine? Answer me! 
 Sleep, just sleep. Winter will be ours. 
 They found you near the shore. 
 You stood too much in the cold and also have a concussion so take it easy. 
 Are you Okay? 
 Yes. 
 Do you remember what happened? 
 Someone attacked me in the ferry, hit me in the head and tried to drown me... 
 Did you see who it was? 
 No. 
 There was a big car with smiley faces on it's lights. 
 Anything else? 
 No, it was all too fast. what did you do in the island? 
 Olof Gran lives there. 
 Did he say anything about Josefine? 
 No, Nothing. 
 Rest now. We'll speak when you're on your feet. 
 I bought you something with rum and raisin. 
 I hope you like it. Sadly I couldn't find something else. 
 I'll put a guard outside. 
 No, it's not necessary. 
 With all that's happened, you will need all the force you can get. 
 We need someone like you in the investigation. 
 I got the impression that Silverhöjd's police force is not very good. 
 You will work in the crime department. You'll have access to all our resources. 
 I want to find who took Anton, you want to find who took Josefine. 
 It could be the same offender. 
 I'm not here to solve other people's problems. Thanks, but no thanks. it's alright, I get it. if you change your mind... 
 See ya. 
 Thanks for the chocolate. 
 And I hope you like the rum with raisins. 
 The man was found last night in an antique shop outside Silverhöjd. 
 He was found stabbed to death in his taxi. 
 The police didn't reveal if the crime was related to Anton's disappearance. 
 We don't see any connection so we cannot rule out that Anton is just strayed. 
 The land here is full of sinkholes and old mine shafts. 
 Kids could fall in there and then not be able to crawl back out. 
 We've got policemen and volunteers looking for him. 
 How are you? aren't you the one who answers that? 
 How long will I stay here? 
 We want to keep you through the night, for observation. 
 The girl's blood tests are back, the numbers are normal. 
 The girl is not contagious. 
 We have also received the DNA test results. 
 Your DNA doesn't match the girl's.She's not Josefine. 
 It can't be. Repeat the test. 
 There's no doubt. 
 I have to see her! 
 Be calm, Eva. 
 She's in quarantine. 
 I don't care! I have to see her! 
 No one can see her. 
 Keep an eye on her. 
 Anton! 
 Anton! 
 Anton! 
 The worst here were petty theft and drunks driving. 
 And now all this happens at once. 
 A kid is missing, a taxi driver gets his throat sliced, and Eva... 
 What could they have in common? 
 Can Tom handle this? 
 He's bad at controlling his emotions. 
 But that's what makes him a good cop. 
 Shouldn't he be in here right now? 
 You're right. I'll call him. 
 I doubt we will find a treatment that works. 
 After seeing the scan I think the parasite should be removed surgically. 
 The images are absolutely incredible. We could go to the lab. got time? 
 Josefine? 
 It's mom. 
 Mom is here now, Josefine. 
 Darling... 
 Sleep, just sleep. Winter will be ours. 
 The powerful spells heal the soil's wounds. 
 Tree crowns swelling, fir, and pine vein. 
 Solidified Resin, beautiful crystal... 
 Return to serenity, written in blood. 
 Everything has a meaning, deep beneath the earth. 
 Everything has a meaning, deep beneath the earth. 
 Return to serenity, written in blood. 
 Everything has a meaning, deep beneath the earth. 
 Hello! hello! 
 Everything has a meaning... 
 Hello! 
 Dad sang it for me and I to Josefine. Only us can know it!
