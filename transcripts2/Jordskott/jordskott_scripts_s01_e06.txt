 Please note: this is a translation and requires more work. 
 You can exchange your daughter's life for another life. 
 If you make this trade, because of you, someone else will have to get through, what you're getting through. 
 Damn! 
 Eddie! 
 His throat was cut open. 
 Esmeralda murdered her foster father, I've been told. 
 You know what happened. 
 It will get worse if we do nothing. 
 I know why the water was poisoned. 
 Why don't let people know the truth? 
 What do we do? They don't grow on trees. 
 No ... 
 Goo protects from monsters. 
 Those who live in the forest. 
 The girl is sad. 
 She is disappearing. 
 More children will disappear. 
 A lunatic knows the truth. 
 We should've done it seven years ago. 
 Do you understand the risks for our children? 
 I'm doing this for your sake. 
 Emma, ​​wear boots. It's wet. 
 I know. 
 Do you want pancakes? 
 Yes. 
 Don't go anywhere. 
 Silverhöjds water is considered unhealthy, so the municipality will bring water tanks. 
 You should avoid even boiled water, but it's yet unclear what contaminated it. 
 The municipality is working with lab to obtain analytical results. 
 Until then, residents can fill their water jugs at the main square. 
 Emma! 
 No, no, no ... 
 Emma! Emma! 
 JORDSKOTT 
 We're closing off all main roads. 
 Can we receive cars from Forsebäck? 
 Yes. 
 Cars are allowed to leave the city after been searched. 
 One unit is on the southern link, and more to come. They have description of Emma. 
 Excellent! The Home Guard enforces the operation. 
 They'll organize search party and blocks minor forest roads. 
 This time, we are one step ahead. 
 I need Tom. 
 Has anyone seen him? 
 Thank you. 
 Good morning. Have you managed to get some sleep?  
 Can we talk now? 
 I'm going to the station first, but then you will give a testimony. 
 And I have to be here for so long? 
 I'm sorry. Rules, you know. 
 I actually bring your phone, but it should stay between us. 
 There's not much wi-fi in these walls anyway, I guess. 
 Try something to eat, too, you should be fed, and we'll see each other then. 
 It's small. How long will it take? 
 Until it's clean the water. 
 More it  eats, faster it grows. 
 Feed it properly, then. 
 Food costs money. 
 Oh well. 
 So. 
 Wass. When did this happen? 
 Okay, what's the address? 
 Yes, I will be right there. Good. 
 Bye! 
 Did you see anybody? 
 No. 
 Nothing else suspicious? A red pickup truck? 
 No. Nothing. 
 Have you received any demands or threats? 
 Phone calls? Letters? 
 The door was open, so Emma must've gone out. Jacket and boots are missing. 
 Could she have gone out on her own? 
 No, she would never do that. 
 She knows, she's not allowed to. 
 Someone took her, there must be someone who took her! 
 And you have no idea who it would be? 
 We start with the same person who took Anton. 
 No, it can't be him, because he is ... 
 Because he is ... what? 
 Two children of the board members of Thörnblad cellulose gone missing. 
 Can it be a coincidence? 
 I do not know. 
 And traces of the killer were found in the old factory, owned by the company. 
 You don't even know if you'll find Emma. 
 What a f*cking questions you ask! It is obvious! 
 You are lying. Do you know who took her? 
 I know nothing. I want to go home. 
 I just want Emma to come home. 
 I'll find someone to drive you home. 
 I don't have enough time for that. 
 It only takes fifteen minutes. 
 But we have to go to roadblock ... 
 Hello. Jeanette Eriksson. I'm meber of the board of Thörnblad Cellulose. 
 I don't know how much you know. My daughter Emma ... Someone took her. 
 Your daughter had disappeared, too. 
 She drowned. 
 What if the person who took Anton and Emma, had took Josefine, too. 
 Josefine disappeared seven years ago. 
 Did you talk to your dad about what happened to Josefine? 
 No, but I've really in a hurry ... 
 He warned us, we did not listen. 
 Have you told that to the police? 
 No, the police can't help me. 
 But you can help me. You should know what it feels like to lose a child. 
 Hello. I caught the keys, Jeanette, we can go. 
 Don;t sell your dad's stocks share to Boren. 
 Promise me that. Promise me that. 
 Yes. 
 Promise me you'll help me to find Emma. Please. Please. 
 Come on. 
 Shall we start now? 
 I don't remember much. But I know, I didn't kill Eddie. 
 Just tell us what you can remember, okay? 
 Eddie asked me go with him upstairs, because he wanted to show me something. 
 What did he show you? 
 A knife. 
 This one? 
 Did he threaten you with it? 
 No. 
 He just showed it to me ... and said he had heard that I like knives. 
 Did uou touched the knife? Will we find your fingerprints on it? 
 Then he tried to kiss me and to take my sweater off but I said I didn't want it. 
 I said no. 
 What did he do then? 
 He said I could get the knife, if I agreed to make out with him. 
 And I agreed. 
 Could've someone else been in the room? 
 Could've someone attacked you? 
 I don't remeber. 
 It's just completely black to me. 
 I must've been drugged. 
 Do blood tests, you'll see it is true. 
 It's true! 
 Yes, yes, I believe you. 
 What happened then? 
 I just remember, that ... 
 I'm alone in the room, and there's a lot of blood everywhere. 
 And I see Eddie ... 
 He just lies down there. 
 And then I run from there. 
 Through the window upstairs? 
 When you run away, did you notice a red pickup truck parked nearby? 
 I do not know. Probably. 
 Do you recognize this man? 
 No, who is it? 
 Hello. What's going on? 
 There are no signs of forced entry. 
 No obvious traces around the house, from what I can see. 
 Can you go in and ask her for a snack, so I can look round undisturbed? 
 Tom wanted me at roadblocks ... 
 It can wait. Go in and keep her occupied for a while, she needs it. 
 Hey, is there any chance I can have some coffee? Thank you. 
 You should let someone look at your head. 
 It's just a graze. 
 You've reached Eva Thörnblad. 
 I can't take your call ... 
 Victoria, you can go. 
 I think, we've done here. 
 Go on patrol of the roadblock at the northern trail. 
 Thanks for your help with ... 
 No sweet. 
 Have you seen Eva Thörnblad today? 
 Yes, in the garage, on the way there. 
 If you see her, ask her to give me a call. 
 Absolutely. 
 I know you have Emma... 
 Let me go! 
 Now you shut us up. 
 Now take it easy. 
 Hello, Ylva. What do you having today? 
 Fish. The whole money. 
 Eva! 
 Eva! 
 You've reached Eva Thorn ... 
 How are we doing with the water problem? 
 Ylva can take care of it, but it takes time. 
 For how long? 
 I'll keep you posted. 
 And what about the girl, disappeared this morning? 
 The one who took her left no trace. 
 And Eve Thörnblad? It there any chance that she'll go ballistic? 
 I have full control over her. If there would be some changes, I'll decide otherways. 
 I hope so. 
 I thought ... Damn! 
 
 
 
 Here you are. 
 Next. 
 Coffee? 
 This looks much better, Borje. 
 I'm glad you've changed your mind. 
 It'll pay off in spades long after, you'll see. 
 Although I changed my decision to positive, the conditions are the same. 
 We must do extensive measurements before we start test explosions. 
 I wish we would have time for that, but unfortunately, we don't. 
 So thanks for looking into it, and finding that nothing serious happens. 
 And as a small proof my gratitude ... 
 I want to give you this. Take it. 
 It is a great pleasure to work with you. 
 Thörnblad cellulose destroy nature! 
 They are pathetic. 
 They've got ... 
 How long do you think it will take before people start to react, Gustaf? 
 When are you going to take responsibility? 
 One day you will be condemn! 
 Thank you. 
 See you tomorrow, everyone. 
 Thanks for today. Take care. 
 This wasn't exactly cheering. 
 What's happened? 
 Olof Gran was found dead. 
 Drowning accident. 
 He had been drinking, of course. 
 Oh, oh, oh. Did you know him well? 
 We have barely spoken since he was dismissed, but we had worked together. 
 Nearly 25 years. 
 He was my supervisor, when I started here. 
 Olof was a good cop, in fact the best we ever have here. 
 Never gave up on single case, both good one or bad one. 
 He don't deserve to die this way. 
 Well ... 
 How did it go with Jeanette Eriksson? 
 Uh, Jeanette ... I found nothing, but perhaps lab people would have better luck. 
 Where's Eve? 
 I haven't seen her. 
 Have you tried to call? 
 Yes. 
 Tom, how are you? You look like you hadn't slept for days. 
 I do not remember how my bed looks. 
 May be you should rest a bit? 
 No. We have lab results on murder of Eddie Olsson. I have to go to jail. 
 Esmeralda is hiding something. 
 What is it, Tom? 
 I'm on top of it.  
 Bye-bye. 
 Eva. 
 Hi Eva, Gustaf Borén here. 
 Hope you are well. 
 I dont have time to talk right now. 
 Hedman has announced that everything is ready for purchase of your dad's shares. 
 Can we agree to a meeting, so we may sign an agreement as soon as possible? 
 Eva? I understand if you have your doubts. 
 But I am ready to buy you out at the rate of the current share value plus 10%. 
 As I said, I can't really talk right now. 
 Wait. Eva? Hello? 
 Hello. Police. Driver's license, please. 
 What's happened? 
 It is a routine check. 
 What have you got there? 
 Eva. Hello. 
 Hello, Victoria. 
 You can take the next car. 
 Did Goran manage to get in touch with you? 
 Yes. 
 A kid is missing. Sick b*st*rd. 
 Hey, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Can I ..? 
 Yes, of course. Have a good one. 
 A quarter. He's fiffteen minutes late. 
 Fifteen, sixteen, after fourteen ... 
 I'm not sure if he can come today. He has a lot on his plate. 
 He is busy with that Eva business.  
 Otherwise he would've been here by now. 
 You can't go hunting in office suit, Dad. 
 Sorry, Nicklas, the hunt isn't an option today. 
 I need to talk to your mom. 
 We can go hunting other day. 
 When can we meet with them here? 
 Within a few hours. I'd finished draw up papers since you asked me about them. 
 That's good, Gerda. I want us started as soon as possible. 
 I baked those yesterday. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you know where to start? 
 It could be anywhere. 
 The forest is huge. 
 We're going to begin the test explosion at cutting surface, where it is cleared. 
 But ... 
 What is it, Gustav? 
 Eva will sell Johan's shares, but she hasn't signed yet. 
 I want it done before we start. 
 You know Johan's plans. We can't take a risk even she would oppose. 
 Why would she do that? 
 Does she know what are you going to do? 
 She goes through Johan's things on the farm.  
 Who knows what she could find? 
 Nicklas! Nicklas, stop! 
 Nicklas, сalm yourself! 
 Nicklas, go down now. 
 Nicklas! 
 Gerda ... 
 Yes. 
 What is it? 
 You look completely melted. 
 No, I'm just a little tired. 
 Let me take care of this. 
 It's totally my fault. 
 The test are back. 
 You weren't sedated with anything. 
 But I remember nothing. 
 Are results accurate? 
 Yes, that's for sure! 
 You're lying to me. 
 So you don't believe me anymore? 
 I just want to make sense of it. 
 You said you've never touched the knife and yet we find your fingerprints on it. Why is that? 
 I do not know. 
 You don't remember. 
 Maybe, you still held the knife, when he tried to force himself on you, and you defended yourself? 
 You panicked. 
 Stop it! 
 You did not kill him on purpose... 
 Stop, I said! 
 Some of your foster fathers confirmed your violent behavior. 
 Do you know what those disgusting old men trying to do? 
 I tried to make them stop. Do you know how it feels to be so helpless? 
 Do you know what it feels like when no one believes you?! 
 You said you believed in me! You said it. You're fucker just like everyone else! 
 Help ... help ... 
 You'll soon be home again, sweetheart. 
 Please Eve, call me. 
 You have to trust me. 
 I want to help you. We can solve it... 
 What the hell ... Tom. Tom! 
 Tom... What the hell. 
 Oh, sh1t, sh1t. 
 Hold on, hold on, Tom. 
 It is Wass, it's Wass here. Send an ambulance there. 
 My god, how are you? Do you need help? Do you want a ride? 
 No. 
 You shouldn't be out here in that condition. 
 I don't need a ride, so you can go now. 
 Where are you going? 
 Forsebäck, can you drive me there? 
 All right. 
 No ... No, no. 
 Emma. 
 Mom ... 
 Yes, you would be home soon. 
 Yes, you would be home soon. 
 Come out. 
 Go. 
 Down here. 
 Down! 
 Down! 
 Did you think you could get away with it? 
 You killed my son. 
 My beloved Eddie. 
 What did he do to you? 
 What did he do to you?! 
 Do it! 
 Shoot. 
 Please. 
 Get out of here. 
 Get out of here! Go to hell!  Go to hell! 
 We're there, sweetie, that's right!. 
 Stop! I'll shoot. 
 Emma! 
 Emma! Emma! 
 Why are you doing this, you b*st*rd? 
 You can't do this. 
 If the Nature invades you, it will never lets you go. 
 Stop it! 
 You're just like everyone else. 
 We have more patients who become ill because of water. I need your help. 
 Place them in there. There. 
 Good. 
 Dammit! 
 Come on now. 
 Careful with that. 
 You'll get more soon, sweetheart. I promise. 
 I let them take her. 
 She's gone and it's my fault. 
 Emma Eriksson disappeared from her home early this morning. 
 The question is whether there is a link to Anton Leander, also missing. 
 The crimes in Silver Height have grabbed international attention. 
 Police are remaining silent about the details and possible connection between murders and missing children. 
 Emma? 
 Emma, ​​is that you? 
 Emma! Emma, ​​is that you? 
 Emma. She is gone. 
 She's gone and it's my fault. 
 Where are you now? 
 On the farm. 
 Stay there, I'll be right there. 
 How could I be so f*cking stupid? 
 Listen to me. 
 Do nothing, stay where you are. 
 I'm on my way. 
 Why are you up? 
 What is it? 
 Factory? There wasn't any bad man there, sweetheart. I checked. 
 Is it something behind the picture? 
 Should I ... 
 Wait here. 
 Have you been here with grandpa? 
 Sleep now.
