 There is no turning back. 
 We gave you something that healed you a parasite called jordskott. 
 Nothing will be the same, for better or worse. 
 I need to talk to Esmeralda. 
 Find her, Jörgen, and kill her. 
 It's you who is chased by the police? 
 The poison took all living plants, animals and everything underground. 
 You must stop, Gustaf. 
 Do not touch me! 
 No parent should have to go through the horror of losing a child. 
 The agreement is the cause of all this? 
 Hey! Wait! 
 Police. 
 It's a great responsibility to run a company of this size. 
 Borén is still willing to buy you out. 
 My advice is that you accept his offer. 
 Eva, if you sign, you take over the shares. Are you ready for the responsibility? 
 If it's about money, I am quite sure that he can raise the bid. 
 Do you have a pen? 
 Excuse me. 
 How do you feel about Silverhöjd? 
 You hardly dare go out anymore. Missing children, murder, undrinkable water, and those tree-huggers... 
 You may soon go. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Do not thank me. 
 Come with me. 
 We should lock them up for good! 
 So you know that Josefine live? 
 She has been held hostage all this time. as leverage against John, your dad, because he wouldn't stop to harvest. 
 After my father's death you were next. 
 Emma and Anton were taken for the same reason. 
 How much do you know about the kidnapper? 
 We know that they are not human. 
 He, because of my dad there's just one of them left alive. 
 It does not make him less dangerous. 
 Underestimate him not. The children will not be released until the forest is left alone. 
 We have tried to stop Borén, get him to listen, but he refuses. 
 We do not need him to listen anymore. 
 So Esmeralda do not know this ? 
 No. 
 In this case, she is a danger to everyone and herself. 
 That's why I need your help. 
 Make sure to bring her here fast. I'll take care of her. 
 Good. 
 Wass. 
 Hey, what's good. 
 We have received a call about a suspected stabbing at Silverhöjd school. 
 I come. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 It seems she's done it again. 
 Okay, go get the girl. 
 Yep. 
 IS IT OK TO COME? 
 Gonna check! 
 Hear from m??? 
 Well, we're all gathered now. 
 Thomas and Jeanette, it was you who called the meeting. 
 I hope it is because you want to apologize for your actions yesterday. 
 No, Gustav, that's not why. 
 Oh, Thomas? 
 What do you want , then? 
 Huh? 
 Eva, how nice. 
 Sorry I'm a little late. 
 I have my father's will with me. If you'd like to turn to page five. 
 You too, Gustaf. 
 There you can see that I now own my father shares in the company which makes me a member of the board. 
 Yes ... You are of course warmly welcome the board, but ... 
 Thank you, Gustaf. 
 You can sit. 
 I immediately stops Thörnblad's engagement in Silverhöjd forest. 
 Eva, you're the biggest single shareholder in the company but you haven't the majority. 
 You understand, huh? 
 If you all want to look up the last page of the document ... you can see that Thomas and Jeanette kindly sold me their shares. I have the majority to decide what I want. 
 And I decide that all operations cease with immediate effect. 
 Should it be like this?  
 I am about to go crazy! 
 Your senses are untrained, inexperienced. 
 You have to control it, otherwise it can go really bad. 
 If your senses break down, you will be crazy for real. But you can do it, Eva. 
 I want to get back Josefine. 
 We follow the plan. This will release the children. 
 You have just stopped Borén, now we're off to school. 
 We have received a call. 
 We need to go to Silverhöjd school, now. girl ... 
 I've done little sandwiches. 
 And I got drinks with it, how about that. 
 Do you prefer pear soda? Or water? 
 Hey, guys. 
 We would need to be alone here for a while. Ten minutes top. 
 I'll show you first how I do. 
 Clear your mind. 
 Start with scents. 
 Focus on them ... and sort them one by one. 
 Do the same with every sound, every taste, every feeling. 
 See them in front of you like puzzle pieces that you can move ... and delete as you wish. try. 
 It can't be done!  
 Do not rush. Take it easy, breathe. 
 Close your eyes, try to find scents. 
 Separate them. 
 Wait ... 
 What do you see? 
 Four. 
 No, three. 
 There are two people a man and a woman, and then ... then something else. 
 Don't use only what you see here, use also what you already know. 
 That's the man of the pickup and his dog. 
 The dog is seriously injured. 
 How do you know? 
 Blood. It smells different, more dead somehow. 
 There is something here. 
 An amulet. 
 Good. Very good. 
 Sssch. 
 Come. 
 Do it. 
 Do it, then! 
 Piss off! 
 Hey. 
 How are you? 
 Well, I am alive. Thanks Wass. 
 How are you?  
 I'm fine, thanks. 
 Thank me by going home and rest. 
 Yes, when this is over. 
 You have been suspended from the investigation. 
 She tried to hell murder me!  
 I will not let her ... Sorry. 
 I will not let her go away. 
 Then make sure to keep your temper in check. 
 Gloves. 
 Yes. 
 Dinner for two. 
 Esmeralda was not alone. 
 A young man from Solbergavägen. 
 Linus. 
 He seems to be a little in love with Esmeralda. 
 Is it shared?  
 He hopes well that this will help. 
 We must take him in for questioning. 
 I can do it. 
 Tom ... 
 He dislikes the police. 
 But we managed to get some contact when I was there. 
 Okay. But then you get to take Eva with you. 
 Thörnblads is innovative and doesn't fear to be influenced by the outside world. 
 Therefore, we have decided to discontinue our operations in Silverhöjd forest. 
 Thanks. 
 Why have you suddenly changed your mind? 
 We have learnt from the criticism received regarding environmental risks and concluded that it is not worth environmental risks to proceed. 
 How are the jobs?  
 Save Silverhöjd forest! 
 Thank you, thank you for coming. 
 But what about the employment? 
 For a while only , my friend. 
 You need to be a little bigger. 
 The leaves turn yellow, the water is poisoned and nature dies. 
 If we do not get you , maybe it'll never recover. But you have to grow Should you not just stay home? 
 No, the job is the only thing holding me together right now. The job and Ida. 
 She behave strangely, says Petra. 
 But that's just an excuse for me not to see her. 
 You will see her again. 
 It'll come a time after this ... which is better. 
 Do you believe it?  
 Yes, I have to believe. 
 What will you do then, when all this is over? 
 Just something completely normal. go home with Josephine, eat hot dogs and macaroni. 
 How strange trees look. 
 The cop are here, call you later. 
 A young woman sought in connection with the murder of Eddie Olsson. 
 Police stays silent on the context of previous acts of violence but warns that the girl may be armed and dangerous. 
 And where the hell are you going, Jorgen? 
 Where then, son of a bitch ?!  
 I'm talking to you! 
 You want to answer? 
 I still hear bad. 
 It was your job to take care of Eddie. 
 It's your fault that he's dead. 
 A real man would find that f*cking whore and kill her. 
 Huh, do you hear that? 
 It's your fault that Eddie is dead. 
 It's your fault. It's your fault! 
 Shut up! 
 Go to hell. Go to hell! 
 Sorry. It was not my intention. 
 Jorgen! 
 Nicklas, where are you going?  
 Nowhere. To the forest. 
 What's behind your back? 
 What should you do with it in the woods? 
 If you fall, it might be good to have. I've seen it on television. 
 Come home before it gets dark, so we have coffee later. I've made baked buns. 
 Yeah. Is it my turn?  
 Green. 
 Dad. Hey! 
 It's your turn. 
 Yes, sorry. 
 Let's see ,,. 
 Gustaf Boren, President of Thörnblads: Thörnblads is innovative and doesn't fear to be influenced by the outside world. 
 Therefore, we have decided to discontinue our operations in Silverhöjd forest. 
 Why have you suddenly changed your mind? 
 Now you get to sit out a turn. 
 Nope. 
 Sorry Yes, it is Gustaf Boren. 
 What were you thinking, what are you up to? 
 What do you mean cancel?  
 I had no choice. 
 Eva intends to keep Johan's shares, so it is she who decides now. 
 How can she do that, she has promised you. 
 Without me you would have never known about the silver. You must arrange this. 
 How the hell should I?  
 It's already started. 
 If I do not get my part of the silver I will have to secure the future of Nicklas otherwise. 
 Maybe I should call Anna-Lena... 
 Your threat doesn't matter, Gerda. 
 There's nothing I can do anyway. 
 I'm sorry, Gustaf ... but you leave me no choice. 
 Gerda? 
 Emelie, take Saga with you and and go watch a movie or something upstairs. 
 I have to talk to mom a little. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 What is it, Gustav? 
 You go inside. I'll come after. 
 You will not be at the interrogation? Nope. 
 He is waiting for us. 
 Yes ... Linus. 
 Hey. Goran Wass. 
 Hey. 
 What the hell are you doing, frigging idiot ?!  
 You may have it after. 
 I take the interrogation. Go home, Tom. 
 I am only talking to him. 
 It is perhaps best to ... come. 
 I need this first. 
 You get your mobile after. 
 What was up with this fellow? 
 Anna-Lena, we need to talk about this. 
 Honey, wait a minute. You! 
 Listen. Anna-Lena! 
 You should have told me this!  
 Gerda and I have not together anymore. addition to a son. 
 I could not help ... 
 You have lied to me. 
 How am I supposed to trust you again? 
 Our whole life together feels like a big lie. And that's not the worst. 
 The worst thing is that your son grew up without his father. Who does something like that? 
 How is Esmeralda?  
 How should I know? 
 Did you not met at the school yesterday ?  
 No. 
 Strange, because we ... 
 Do you know what we found when we were there? 
 Lunchboxes from Solbergavägen. 
 And you know what else we found?  
 No. 
 Signs that Esmeralda could have got into trouble. Really bad, Linus. 
 I know you want what's best for her, and I want too. 
 Can't you help me? 
 I do not know where she is. 
 We have just messaged today. 
 Okay. 
 Will you help me to get hold of her? 
 Thörnblads intervention in nature can have severe consequences for the ecosystem. 
 It's the middle of summer and the trees are dying. 
 We have no evidence that Thörnblad is behind, but ... 
 Hey. 
 Need help? 
 Yeah ... I was going to check if you had a charger for this. 
 Let's see . 
 I'll peek. Wait. 
 I found one. 
 So. 
 Yesterday a lead investigator Tom Aronsson was injured during an interrogation 
 The cops left, see you on the tennis court at midnight  with a young woman. She has a gray jacket, black jeans and athletic shoes. 
 A growing number are now wondering what's happening in Silverhöjd. He put it here. Look under the papers. I saw that he put it ... Calm, Linus. Give me my mobile!  Calm down! Let me go, I said. I'll have my mobile! Calm yourself!  My mobile! Nicklas! Nicklas, what is it? Nothing. Sorry, Mom. Sorry. What have you done?  Sorry. Forgive me, Mom. Do you ...? The girl is sick. I thought that I could take care of her, but ... I know it was wrong. Sorry. Josefine ... Hey . Jorgen here. Did you find Esmeralda? Boy, listen. She's too strong for you. What are you talking about?  Forget her . She killed my brother. Storm? Okay. I'll send you a link, but I have warned you. Is this really necessary?  The place is sacred to him. The only man who has been there is your ancestor Adolf Frederick Thörnblad. That was when he signed the contract almost 300 years ago. If people found this place it would be a catastrophe. Therefore, the entrance to the underworld is kept secret. This was before many people's homes. It looks different now. There was life down here. Brand amazingly, all the silver ... It must be worth a fortune. This site's value can not be measured in money. Come on. Stay here. Ylva, how do we do now? You talk, he listens. He is here now. Mun, I know what happened to your family. It was my father, Johan Thörnblad, who was the culprit. Words can not describe how sorry I am for what he did to you. I know it can not suppress the anger or sadness that you feel. I have done as you wish. The agreement between our families have been reinstated, so I ask you ,,. Give back the kids. And give back Josefine. Ylva?  He's gone. Gone? But the kids ...! Mun! Josefine! There is no point. He wants to know first if it is as you say. Then he'll let the kids. How can I trust him? When he says something, he means it. I need your help. You want me to find the tomb, the silver treasure. Yes. And there you will find what you are looking for. f*ck you, cop b*st*rd!  I'm sorry, Linus. What about him?  His pride is hurt. When he's calmed down, he may go. We have to find Esmeralda. No, let Wass, or someone else take care of it. You should rest. desktop service, we said. If you do not go home, you can put yourself at a desk. As you like. Tom. What happened to Ida with you? Hey, how weird it's you calling. She sleeps badly. Maybe because she was not allowed to stay?  And she hardly eats anything. And this weird drawing she does, over and over again. It's a girl lying in a bed and looking dead. Can I talk to her?  No, she fell right asleep of exhaustion. Expect to hear from this. Holy sh1t ... Eva? Linus! Linus! Hello? Hey, Esmeralda. Do not be afraid. I can explain everything that happened to you. Stop!  Trust me. If you get close, I'll kill you. You have never killed. Not now, either. Esmeralda ... Esmeralda, I do not want to hurt you. You do not want to hurt anyone. I murdered Eddie! He did that himself. Because of me. I'm a monster! No, you're not a monster. Listen. You have a power you do not control. What are you talking about? It is the power that murdered Eddie, and that does this to me. But stop! Stop It! Stop it! You can control this. You are not alone, there are others like you. Are there more?  Are there more like me? I will take you to her. She is waiting for you. Is that Emma? Has something happened?  No, calm yourself. We need to have a confirmation. Yes, of course. Is this Emma's jacket?  Yes, it is. Where did you find it?  That I can't tell. She must have been where you found it. It's a little early to say that now. We can't draw any hasty conclusions. We are doing everything to find her. Yes, I understand. Come. Come on, let's go. Well. Eva, do not turn off now. I have something very important to tell you. I've made a terrible mistake. You've got to pay the price. It was a long time ago now, 1978th I sprayed the forest with a poison, a prohibited defoliants. And it went horribly wrong. We didn't know it, but there lived an unknown people in the north woods. Adults and children ... lay dead everywhere. And I panicked."Burn up this! Please, get rid of it." That's why Josefine disappeared. Yes she did not drown. She lives, Eva! She was abducted because of my actions. But Josefine is sick, just like me, so it's urgent now. More children are probably going to be soon in danger. I know this sounds incredible but in this book our ancestor Adolf Frederick Thörnblad explains how it all fits together. This book, Eva, must never fall into the wrong hands. If people know what riches are hidden here, it will be a disaster. I know how the board can be stopped and the company put out of business but I am sick and need help. When you come here, we'll help each other To set things right again. You, me, Josefine and your brother. Yes, you have a brother . He is the son of Gerda, my secretary. When all this is over, we will welcome Nicklas into our family and the Thörnblads dynasty will be prosperous again, Eva. Huh? What is it?
