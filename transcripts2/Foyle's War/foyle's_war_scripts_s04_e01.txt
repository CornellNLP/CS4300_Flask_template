 [ RUMBLING ] 
 The Jerries are here! 
 The Jerries are here! 
 (US ACCENT) How you doin', ma'am? 
 It's OK. We're here to beat the Krauts. 
 Excuse me, Miss, we're lost. 
 Could you tell us the way to Hawthorn Cross, please? 
 Well, you can't get through that way. 
 You'll have to go back the way you came. 
 Thank you, Miss. Turn her around, will you, we've got to go back. 
 (WOLF WHISTLES) 
 Knock it off, you guys, we're meant to be guests here. 
 Where have you been, then, you're late. 
 Haven't you seen? 
 The Dough Boys are here. 
 What? Just now, outside. 
 Didn't you hear them? 
 Dough Boys? They'll be on their way up to Hawthorn Cross. 
 So it's true, then? 
 What? 
 The airfield. 
 What airfield? 
 You'll see soon enough. 
 Americans. Late for the last one, late joining this one. 
 I'll have another. 
 Good shot, Farnetti. 
 There it is. 
 What do you think? 
 Mud. 
 That all you gotta say? 
 What else is there to say? 
 We're how many feet above sea level? 
 You tell me, captain. 
 So? 
 Oh, come on. 
 It's been raining for three weeks. 
 Drainage? Forget about it. 
 You try to land a Fort here, it'll disappear. Captain... 
 You're on my land. 
 This is my land. 
 Hi. I'm John Kieffer, 215th Engineers. 
 You're on my land. 
 Now get back in that...whatever you want to call it and get off my land! 
 Sir, this is Hawthorn Cross, right? 
 I'm afraid we have a requisition order. 
 You should have received the papers. 
 I've received nothing. 
 Now, I shan't tell you a third time. 
 Can't you tell this guy we're on the same side? 
 Stow it, Joe. With all due respect, sir, you shouldn't threaten us like this. 
 OK, OK, we're leaving. But you shouldn't have done that. 
 We'll be back. 
 I thought you were a goner at Trondheim. 
 It was close. 
 It was a mess. 
 If it wasn't for you... 
 Forget it. 
 You're well out of it, mate. 
 Believe me. 
 I just wish I could join you. 
 After Trondheim there was Namsos. 
 Then France, now Africa. 
 It's never gonna bloody end. 
 How's Perry? 
 Jack Perry? 
 You didn't hear? 
 He went west. 
 No... I didn't hear. 
 Benghazi, poor sod. 
 Come on. Have another one. 
 No. I've got to go. 
 I've had enough of this beer. 
 How about a Scotch? 
 You'll be lucky. 
 Things are that bad? 
 I'll walk home with you. 
 No...I'm staying. 
 I'll see you around. 
 It's been good to see you. 
 I'll have another. 
 Were you wanting Scotch? 
 Will? 
 Dad. 
 You still up? 
 I waited up for you. 
 Well, I'm here. 
 Been boozing? 
 Yes. 
 That's the third night in a row. 
 I was down at the Wheatsheaf. 
 I saw Paul Milner. 
 Do I know him? 
 I was with him in Norway. 
 He's a policeman now. 
 I'm off to kip. 
 You're only here for a week. 
 I've hardly seen you. 
 I'm here tomorrow. 
 You'll see me then. 
 Dad, what are you doing up this late? 
 What do you think I'm doing? I'm waiting for you. I'm all right. 
 You shouldn't be out this late, not on your own. 
 You know how your mother and me worry about you. Dad... 
 Working in that pub. You should never have left Benson's. Dad... 
 [ PHONE RINGING ] 
 What's that now? 
 Hello. Stan Davies speaking. 
 Stan, who is it? 
 Sshh. 
 Yep. Right. 
 Yeah, I know it, yeah. 
 All right, I'm on my way. 
 What's happened? 
 A fire in Market Street. 
 I've got to go over. 
 At this time of night? 
 It's not a raid, is it? 
 Come on, these things don't happen by the clock. I have to go. 
 You go back to bed. And Susan, you get in yours. You need to rest. 
 I'm on my way. Night, Dad. 
 Goodnight, and don't wait up. 
 You're very late. 
 Oh, don't start on me, Mum. 
 I never know what you're up to any more. 
 What makes you think I'm up to anything? 
 Here you are. Take this. 
 No need to tell Dad. 
 Just...go out and get yourself something nice. 
 This is ten bob. 
 Where did you get this? 
 Tips... 
 [ DOOR OPENS ] 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Morning. Sergeant Brooke? 
 Yes, sir. You must be Mr Foyle. 
 That's right. 
 Very good to meet you, sir. 
 I've just been transferred from London. Deptford Green. 
 I wasn't too keen to be sent here, to be honest. Oh? 
 It's a bit out in the sticks. 
 I'm Sam Stewart. 
 Nice to meet you, Miss. 
 Anything else? 
 Not really, sir. 
 Oh, actually, sir, there was a fire last night in...Hilton Village. 
 Nothing suspicious, though. 
 Local lads say it was started by a spark from the fireplace. 
 Your sergeant, Mr Milner, he's gone over there. Has he? 
 Yes, and there's a gentleman waiting for you. 
 I didn't know what to do with him so he's in your office. 
 Name of Kieffer. Captain. 
 He's a Yank. 
 Have the Americans arrived in Hastings? Looks like one has. 
 I've never actually seen an American. Except in the films. 
 Jimmy Cagney! 
 All cowboys or gangsters. 
 I was thinking more of Clark Gable. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 You've had a problem or two at Hawthorn Cross, is that right? 
 Look, Mr Foyle, I don't want to get the guy into any trouble. 
 I mean, if I go to my people they're gonna come down on him like gangbusters. 
 So I thought if I came to someone local... 
 Who are we talking about? 
 This farmer...Barrett. 
 David Barrett. 
 I can understand why he's upset. 
 You know his family have owned that place since, gee, Queen Whoever. 
 But I'm beginning to feel he could be a danger to my men. 
 And why's that? 
 Well, first time we went up there he had a shotgun. 
 Took a pot shot at one of the Jeeps. 
 And there have been other incidents. 
 Blocking our path with his tractors, snooping around. 
 He won't talk to us. 
 And you're building an airfield, is that right? 
 It's on his land. 
 It was requisitioned. 
 Well, the...least I can do is talk to him. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Is that it? 
 Well, as a matter of fact... they've given us this old school as a base. 
 It's a hell of a place. 
 Damp, draughty and stuck in the middle of nowhere and... 
 Well, that's my point. I want someone to come and give us a talk. 
 A talk on what? 
 The English. 
 None of my boys has ever been out of the States before. 
 Some of them feel they've landed on another planet. 
 I need someone to come out and tell us what goes on around here. Who? 
 I don't know. A teacher, priest, whoever. 
 I don't get a chance to get out and meet many British people. 
 Say, I don't suppose...you'd be interested, would you? 
 No. No, no. You're right. 
 Not my territory, you know. 
 OK. Well, if you think of anyone, would you let me know? I will. 
 You know, until two weeks ago I didn't even know what a kipper was. 
 We need help. 
 I can see that. 
 Hey, sugar. 
 I'm sorry, are you talking to me? 
 I don't see anyone else around. 
 Well, my name's not Sugar. 
 Well, what is it, then? 
 Can I help you? 
 I'm Joe Farnetti. I'm here to pick up my captain. 
 Oh... 
 Are you a cop? 
 No, not really. You still haven't told me your name. 
 It's Stewart. Sam Stewart. 
 Sam, as in Samantha? 
 Yes. How would you like to see a movie with me tonight? 
 Sam Stewart? 
 With you? 
 That's the general idea. 
 I don't even know you. 
 Here's your chance to find out. 
 And you don't know me, either. 
 Are all you Americans like this? 
 I can't speak for the others. 
 I'm afraid I'm busy tonight. 
 How about tomorrow night? 
 Even busier. 
 I'm here for a lot of nights. 
 Everything all right? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Mr Foyle, thank you for everything. 
 Let me know how you get on. I will. 
 Farnetti. 
 Captain. 
 I'll be seeing you. 
 Clark Gable? 
 What do you think I am, Mr Foyle? 
 What are you gonna do, arrest me? 
 No, of course not. 
 That's the last thing we want. 
 The Yanks. Nobody invited them to come over here. 
 We can win the war without them. 
 Can we? 
 They come marching on to my land without so much as a by your leave. 
 Your land, I'm afraid, has been requisitioned by the War Office. 
 Not the Americans, so if you have any argument, take it up with them. 
 So they've got you on their side, then? 
 All right, I took a shot at them. 
 I was wrong to do that but I've got a temper on me and sometimes I act off the top of my head. 
 I'll pay for the damage if that's what you want. 
 No, no, no. But you should just... leave them alone. 
 Oh, that's what I should do, is it? 
 Right, let me show you something. 
 My family have been on this land for 100 years. 
 My dad farmed here and his dad before him. 
 You go back to the Domesday Book, there was a farm here at Hawthorn Cross. 
 Now this. There's gonna be a runway here, petrol dump over there. 
 Water towers, fire stations. 
 I've seen their plans. 
 120,000 cubic yards of concrete. 
 400,000 feet of wire. 
 By the time they finish here, well...there'll be nothing left. 
 Hastings is in the front line. 
 We can't expect nothing to change. 
 I don't expect anything. 
 But let me tell you this. 
 We're worried about Hitler invading. 
 What's the point? 
 The invasion's happened. 
 They take our land right from under our noses. 
 And you say we can't do nothing about it? 
 We just have to stand there and watch? 
 Well, it doesn't make any sense. 
 Bob Milner, are you in charge? 
 Stan Davies. 
 It was a spark from a fire? 
 That's what they're saying. 
 Caught the bedclothes. The whole lot went up like Crystal Palace. 
 You came over from Hastings? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a long way for a little house fire. 
 I knew the son. 
 William Grayson. 
 He didn't make it, then? 
 He died this morning. 
 I'm sorry. I knew it was bad. 
 You were here last night? 
 Yeah, but when I arrived it was almost over. 
 Started in his bedroom. 
 See, the bed is close to the fireplace and the blanket must have caught. 
 The door was locked from the inside. 
 We found the key by the bed. 
 He never got to it. 
 I don't know why. 
 There was nothing we could do. 
 Have you spoken to his old man? 
 Not yet. 
 Is it safe to go up? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Just watch yourself on the stairs. 
 According to this the fire was started by the bedclothes catching light. Nothing untoward. 
 I know, sir, but...I'd still like to look into it. 
 Over the weekend, in my own time. 
 Because...? 
 At Trondheim when I was wounded he carried me out. 
 And I hadn't seen him since then. 
 I can't believe that he came home and he died like this. 
 Well, war, you know, people die in the strangest circumstances, even heroes. 
 Yes, but I don't understand why he didn't get out. 
 He'd locked himself in but he could have opened the door. 
 There was a key right beside the bed. 
 And why was it locked in the first place? 
 All right. Look into it. 
 Did you hear him come in? 
 I saw him. 
 I waited up for him. 
 He'd been drinking. 
 He'd been drinking with me at the Wheatsheaf. 
 He'd been drinking every night. 
 It was getting to him, the war. 
 He wasn't himself. 
 Was he very drunk? 
 He could barely stand up. 
 What were you drinking? 
 Just bitter. 
 He must have had plenty of it. 
 Why did he lock the door? 
 I don't know. 
 He had nothing to hide. 
 He'd never locked it before. 
 So what happened? 
 Well, I was woken up about an hour later. 
 12 something. I knew something was wrong straightaway. 
 Was it the smoke? 
 I smelled it before I saw it. 
 The whole top floor was alight. 
 When I got up the stairs I tried to open his door. 
 Wasn't he awake? 
 I banged on the door and he heard me. 
 He shouted to me, "I can't see!" 
 And that's all he said. 
 Then the ceiling in the corridor come down and that's all I remember. 
 They dragged me out but they couldn't get Will. 
 (QUAVERING) 
 They couldn't get to him. 
 Oh, Mr Foyle. 
 Good morning, how are you? 
 I'm good, how are you? 
 I'm very well. 
 Do you...? 
 You bet. You too? 
 I do. Been looking after you, then? 
 They couldn't have been more helpful. 
 I was dropping in to get some new line. You brought this over? 
 Sure as hell wouldn't leave it behind. Brand new tournament rod. 
 Reuben Leonard. 
 Reverse guard grips. Hooded silver nickle butt cap. 
 Weighs in at four ounces. 
 How about you? 
 Well, nothing as grand as that. 
 Classic split cane. 
 10 foot? 
 9'6". 
 Heavy. 
 Keeps the bait on the move. 
 Still old-fashioned, though. 
 How do you feel about having a go with mine? 
 Well, I'd feel very privileged. 
 Good. Maybe we can go up to the river together and...I'll swap with you. 
 Mind you, I'd want something in return. 
 Oh, yes? 
 Remember that little talk I mentioned? 
 I still haven't found anyone. 
 Oh, really? 
 Brand new Reuben Leonard. 
 Best rod on the market. 
 How long would this talk have to be? 
 Well, as long as you'd like it to be. 
 Maybe we could have some dinner afterwards? 
 How about tomorrow night? 
 All right. 
 I could send a car. 
 No need. I'll get there. 
 Hooked. 
 I left Will here. How much more did he have to drink? 
 I don't know. A couple of pints. 
 He was sober enough when he left. 
 He was after whisky. 
 There is no whisky. 
 We ran out. 
 That's what I don't understand. 
 I had a few drinks with him. 
 With respect the beer here wouldn't knock anybody out. 
 I serve a good pint. 
 But according to his father he could barely stand when he got home a couple of hours later. 
 Might have gone somewhere else. 
 There's the King's Head or the Red Lion just down the road. 
 What time did he leave? 
 Don't know. Didn't notice. 
 There was a barmaid working here. 
 Yeah. Susan. 
 She'll be in this evening. 
 Do you know where I could find her? 
 I doubt if she can tell you anything. 
 I'd still like to speak to her. 
 I'll get her address. 
 Come on... 
 What is it? 
 (GIGGLES) 
 Stockings! 
 I haven't seen a pair of real stockings since... 
 ..the Christmas before last! 
 The Christmas before last? 
 I was still in college. 
 In New York? 
 Oh, tell me about New York. 
 I can't wait to see it. 
 You won't believe it. 
 Skyscrapers so tall they touch the clouds. 
 That's why they're called skyscrapers. 
 Fifth Avenue... 
 Central Park... 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 Sshh. 
 What is it? 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 Probably Farmer Giles and his blunderbuss. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 I love you, James. 
 I love you so much. 
 You're going to show me everything. 
 And I want to go shopping in Manhattan. 
 I'm gonna see a show on Broadway... 
 Hold your horses. 
 We got a war to fight first. 
 No need to be in such a rush. 
 You weren't exactly slow, Private Taylor. 
 Well, a girl like you, I was just lucky to get to you first. 
 And anyway... 
 We may have less time than you think. 
 What do you mean? 
 What do you think? 
 Well, what? 
 You know... 
 No. Tell me. 
 James, why are you looking at me like that? 
 Tell me. 
 Has anyone told you you've got beautiful hazel eyes? Tell me. 
 Well... 
 Jimmy... 
 Jimmy! 
 Well, thanks for giving up your evening. 
 It's a pleasure, sir. 
 Do I really have to stay? 
 I thought you wanted to get to know the Americans? 
 Well, if the one I met was anything to go by... 
 Forward? 
 Fresh. 
 Well, they're a long way from home. 
 Fighting a war they thought had nothing to do with them. 
 It's not any big surprise, is it? 
 DCS Foyle to see Captain Kieffer. 
 Have you heard from Andrew, sir? 
 No. 
 Sorry to ask. 
 I just haven't heard any news for a while. 
 Well, I'm not sure he's enjoying being an instructor. 
 Missing his spit. 
 Still, I'd have thought he'd have written. 
 No, not recently. 
 But he's due some leave. 
 Welcome to Saint Preserve Us. 
 Well, that's what some of the guys call this place, anyway. 
 St Mary's All Saints. Was that the original name of the place? 
 Yes, it was a school. 
 They must have been teaching survival. 
 So, a one-hour talk in the hall then I hope you'll both stay for something to eat. 
 [ RADIO ] 
 I'll bring these up tomorrow. 
 As long as it doesn't rain. 
 Thank you, Mary. 
 You should get married again. 
 I had enough the first time. 
 I don't know what I'd do without her and that's the truth. 
 You'd manage perfectly well. 
 You going to stop for a cuppa? 
 No, no, I'd... 
 I'd best get back. 
 By the way, I've got some news. 
 Ben's on his way. 
 What? 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 Well, I only got the telegram this morning. 
 He's back from Iceland? 
 He's in Greenock. 
 But that's Scotland. 
 When's he coming? 
 Well, he doesn't say. Just says, "Arrived safely, coming soon." 
 Susan will be thrilled! 
 Think so? 
 Course she will. 
 Does she ever talk about him? 
 You know how it is with young people these days. 
 The parents are the last to know. 
 I wish the two of them would set a date, give us something to look forward to. 
 Radio : 'The Americans never wanted to be part of this war. 
 And although they're now arriving in Britain, they don't want to be there. 
 They are paid more than the British. 
 They eat more than the British. 
 He's right, you know. 
 What? Lord Haw-Haw? 
 You're not serious? 
 I don't even know why we have it on. 
 I know he's a traitor but he's right about the Yanks. 
 It's all a joke to them. 
 They don't give a damn. 
 And if it hadn't have been for Pearl Harbour they wouldn't have come over here at all. 
 But now they're here, they think they own the place. 
 They're taking everything we've got. 
 Come on, Dave. Ask that girl of yours if you don't believe me. 
 What are you talking about? 
 No, no. I've said enough. 
 Thanks for the washing. 
 I'll see you in the week. 
 And I really do appreciate that. 
 Then of course there will be many things you won't understand about us. Yeah, warm beer. 
 Tea. 
 Broads in uniform. 
 Well, yes, even so, I think you'll find there are a lot more things we have in common than you'd imagine. 
 It might perhaps help to remember that for over two years now while the Germans have...bombed us they've tried to starve us. 
 We've been on our own and we might...look a little shabby. 
 A little rough at the edges, a bit quiet, perhaps. 
 But the fact of the matter is... we're very pleased to see you, even though some might say you took your time getting here. Hey! 
 But now you've arrived it's our job to make you welcome and to look after you and as long as you don't criticise the King and Queen and remember to drive on the right side of the road, that is, the left side of the road, you have every chance of seeing the war out. Thank you. 
 OK, everybody, that's about it. 
 Before you go for chow, does anyone have a question? Yes. 
 Mr Foyle, there's something I don't understand. 
 This girl came up to me in the post office the other day and asked to borrow a rubber. 
 [ LAUGHTER ] 
 So I was wondering, did she ask me to take her out? 
 Stow it, Farnetti. Rubbers don't mean the same thing over here. 
 So, if you wanna go to the john, Mr Foyle, how do you say that in English? 
 Well, I'm old enough not to have to ask, Mr Farnetti, but if you need help, you'll find there are lots here who'll be happy to oblige. 
 What? 
 I had a copper in here. 
 He was looking for you. 
 Why? 
 Someone got killed. 
 Albert Grayson's boy, Will. 
 There was a fire. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 What's that got to do with me? 
 He was here the night it happened. 
 So? 
 The copper said he was drunk. 
 I don't know what he did after he left. 
 If he was killed in a fire I can't be held responsible, can I? 
 Listen, did you serve him any... 
 Alan! 
 We've got to talk about this. 
 Decide what to do. 
 Two boys, six and nine. 
 Here's my wife, Ellie. 
 Do you miss them? 
 Oh, yes, I surely do. 
 How about you, do you have kids? 
 Yeah...I have a son. 
 You know, I've been thinking. 
 Maybe inviting some local people here for a dance, get to know us better, what do you think? Good idea. 
 Fill up? 
 I will, thank you. 
 What's wrong with you, Taylor? 
 Forget it, Farnetti. 
 I forgot. Excuse me. 
 You're not eating? 
 I haven't seen so much food in ages. 
 I don't know where to begin. 
 So...thought again about my offer? 
 What? 
 Movies. 
 Oh. Um...yes I have thought again and I've decided to say no for a second time. 
 You got a boyfriend? 
 Actually, I do. 
 Well, forgive me. I was just trying to be...friendly. 
 Excuse me, sergeant. 
 Oh, yeah, you two haven't met, have you? 
 This is Sergeant Jack O'Connor. 
 How do you do. 
 It was a good attempt, Mr Foyle, papering over the cracks. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 Them and us. 
 You need us, so be nice to us. 
 I take it you're not very happy to be here, then? 
 You tried sucking up to Hitler, that didn't work, so you went to war with him. 
 You almost lost that by yourself and now you've dragged us in. 
 No, I'm not crazy to be here. 
 Sorry about that. He had no right to speak to you in that way. 
 Oh, not at all. 
 No need to apologise. 
 You want another beer? 
 Yeah, why not? 
 So, I guess there's no chance you'll come to the dance with me? 
 The captain wants to have a dance. 
 You ever tried the jitterbug? 
 I don't know what that is. 
 I promise. No hands, right? 
 I'm just...5,000 miles away from home and I don't wanna dance with Taylor. 
 I'm sure he looks good in a dress. 
 Oh, he does. 
 Listen, I really should be going now. 
 Sam... 
 I haven't had anything to eat yet. 
 Here, take these. 
 I couldn't. I just can't. 
 I'll send them over. 
 Listen, thanks once again for coming. 
 No, well, look, it was a great pleasure helping out but there's the little matter of our arrangement. 
 The arrangement, what arrangement? 
 The Reuben Leonard! 
 Well, the day after tomorrow? 
 I'd be delighted. 
 And you'll bring me...? 
 That was the deal. 
 I'll mail them to you. 
 Or post them. Whatever. 
 'Dear Sam, I know it's been a long time since I've written and I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorrier still to have to write this. 
 I can't say I've had a good time at Debden. 
 Lots of reasons and of course I was missing you. 
 I never seem to get any leave. 
 Sam, there's no easy way to write this, but...I've met someone else. 
 I can't explain it and I feel wretched but I was going mad on my own, without you, I mean. 
 And it just sort of happened. 
 The last thing I want to do is to hurt you. 
 But I thought I should make a clean breast of it. 
 And, well, there you are. 
 God knows when I'll be home. 
 And you probably wouldn't want to see me anyway. 
 But at the very least you can begin again. 
 Good luck, Sam. 
 Don't think too badly of me. 
 Andrew.' 
 I'm sorry, Mr Milner. 
 She's not here. 
 Do you know where she is? 
 She went to see Dr Rogers. 
 She wasn't feeling too well. 
 She works too hard. 
 Why do you want to see her? 
 I'm investigating the death of Will Grayson. 
 She hasn't anything to do with that. She hardly even knew him. 
 She may have been the last person to see him before he went home. 
 I'd just like to know if he said anything, if there was anything on his mind. 
 You think he did himself in? 
 Perhaps you could ask her to look in. 
 It's important. 
 Susan's a good girl, you know. 
 She'd never get mixed up in anything that wasn't right. 
 How long has she worked at the Wheatsheaf? 
 About a year. She used to work at Benson's over at Bexhill. 
 Benson's? 
 They make chemicals. 
 They started taking on girls back at the start of the war. 
 Girls doing men's jobs. Susan thought it'd be an opportunity. 
 She's always been ambitious. 
 So what happened? 
 She didn't like it. 
 The chemicals got up her nose. 
 So she started at the Wheatsheaf. 
 That girl had her head screwed on. 
 She could do better, that's what I told her. 
 Do you know the landlord there? 
 Alan Carter? 
 Yeah, he's all right. 
 She'll be there later. 
 If you want her, that's where she'll be. 
 Thank you. 
 (GASPS) 
 You shouldn't creep up on me like that. 
 I nearly spilled the whole lot. 
 I want to talk to you. 
 What about? 
 All this. 
 Look, a man is dead. 
 We are responsible. 
 It could be murder, manslaughter, I don't know. 
 I should never have listened to you in the first place. 
 But now you're gonna listen to me. 
 What?! 
 This has got to go. 
 The whole lot of it. 
 We can't stop now. 
 Why not? 
 I need the money. 
 Can't you see this isn't about money any more? 
 It is for me. 
 I need to get out of here. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We're not stopping. 
 You can't make me. 
 We'll see about that. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 And what if I told the police about your little business? 
 I could tell them you made me help you. 
 I'm half your age. 
 Who do you think they'd believe? 
 You wouldn't do that. 
 Wouldn't I? 
 At the start you were all over me. 
 Weren't you, Alan? 
 Well, we're not stopping. 
 And if I go down, YOU go down. 
 Just remember that. 
 We're gonna have the pumping stations here and here. 
 Is that for parachute stores? 
 Exactly. 
 What about water supply? 
 It's crazy, isn't it? 
 We're still pumping water out. 
 This place is a swamp. 
 When we've finished it, we'll have to find a way to pump it back in. 
 120,000 gallons a day. 
 Can you do it? 
 I'll work something out. 
 Hey, captain. 
 Mind if I go into Hastings? 
 I got some things to do. 
 Sure, Farnetti, you got chow time like everyone else. 
 What's her name, Farnetti? 
 Hey, Farnetti, look where you're going. Relax, Dan. 
 What's eating you, Taylor? 
 Nothing, captain. Sergeant, can I have a word with you? 
 Go ahead. 
 In private? 
 Pregnant? 
 That's what she says. 
 And it's yours? 
 That's what she says. 
 Jesus, Mary, that's what I call FUBB for sure. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 She wants you to marry her? 
 I've only known her a few weeks. I can't marry her, for Christ's sake! 
 I'm 23 years old. 
 I don't want to be a dad, you know? 
 It's a bit late to think about that, don't you think? 
 Can't they...? 
 You know, don't they, over here...? 
 You don't get it, Taylor. 
 She had her claws in you the first moment she saw you. 
 She's nothing but a gold-digger. 
 She was just waiting for someone like you to come along. 
 My parents will kill me. 
 You're a fast operator, I'll give you that. 
 How long have you known her? 
 Five, six weeks. 
 And you believe her about the baby? 
 I don't know. I guess so. 
 Well, unless she has some kind of accident, looks like you're stuck with her. 
 Accident? 
 It's a war, Taylor. 
 Accidents happen. 
 Good morning, Miss Stewart. 
 Good morning, sergeant. 
 Call me Brookie. 
 Everyone does. 
 Brookie... 
 There's someone to see you, Miss. 
 Oh? 
 Private Farnetti? 
 Miss Stewart. 
 You didn't get much of a chance to eat anything last night so I said I'd bring some stuff over. 
 Thanks very much. 
 There's...there's some coffee, oranges, some cookies. 
 You know, that kind of stuff. 
 Aren't you going to get into trouble? Hell, no, we got plenty. 
 I just wanted to apologise for maybe coming on a bit strong. 
 I should have listened to your Mr Foyle. 
 You know, them and us. 
 It's just where I come from, people are really... 
 I noticed. 
 Yeah... 
 So...well, anyway... 
 Enjoy it. 
 Thanks. 
 And...I'll see you around. 
 Private Farnetti. 
 Yeah? 
 This dance, the jitterbug... 
 Tomorrow night. 
 I was wondering if the invitation was still open? 
 I'd love to come. 
 Really? 
 What about...your boyfriend? 
 I don't think he'll mind. 
 Swell. That's swell! 
 [ HORN ] 
 I'll just put it down here, then. 
 Thanks, Mary, I'll take it up later. 
 Are you going to stay up here? 
 I've got nowhere else to go. 
 It must be impossible for you, this. 
 There's men everywhere. 
 What did you mean the other day about Susan? 
 What about her? 
 Susan and Ben. 
 You seemed to think there was something wrong. No, no... 
 I was talking out of turn. 
 You don't know how much it means to me, this wedding. 
 I just want her to settle down. 
 You know what sort of girl she is. 
 She gets ideas. 
 But... 
 Her and Ben, they've known each other a long time now. 
 They'll be very happy together. 
 I wonder if any of us will ever be happy again with this war. 
 Have you seen what they're doing over there? 
 I know. 
 If I complain they'll only get the police on to it. Nothing I can do. 
 They've sent Ben up to Iceland. 
 Susan left on her own down here. 
 Oh, we're all changed, all of us. 
 I don't think we'll ever be the same again. 
 Is there something you're not telling me? 
 No, no... Don't you worry, Mary. 
 Ben'll soon be home. 
 Everything will be all right. 
 I promise. 
 You're a shirt short, I'll pick it up later. All right. 
 Come here, you little beauty. 
 How many's that? 
 Three. 
 Same fly? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's my fly. 
 I know. 
 Got it? 
 What do you think? 
 A two-pounder. 
 So, how did you get on with my rod? 
 Well, it's beautiful, it's just that I'm not catching anything. 
 It's a poor workman who blames his tools. Thank you. 
 I keep trying. 
 Been a cop for long? 
 Too long. 
 I was an engineer plodding along in a little place called North Bridge, Massachusetts. 
 This all must have come as quite a shock to you. 
 Pearl Harbour was a wake-up call. 
 You know, Christopher, I could never understand how many of my countrymen were against this war. 
 The isolationists. 
 So when did you sign up? 
 Last November. 
 A month before Pearl. 
 I had a kid brother, his name was Brian. 
 He was 25 years old serving in the US Navy. 
 Destroyer. 
 The Reuben James. 
 They were on convoy duty in the Atlantic. 
 At the end of October they were torpedoed and sunk. 
 German U-Boat. 
 115 people lost their lives. 
 Brian was among them. 
 You know what? 
 No-one noticed. 
 No-one said anything. 
 You see, nobody wanted to go to war. 
 They wanted to pretend it hadn't happened. 
 Sorry. 
 I volunteered the next day. 
 I've got a feeling I'd be better off with my old split cane, you know. 
 That's something I'm learning about you Brits. 
 If it's old, it's got to be good. 
 And you lot think that what's good needs improving. 
 Hey, I'm the one who caught the fish. 
 Well, you're the one with my rod. 
 I tell you what, let's call it even and go get a drink. 
 Warm beer? 
 Sounds perfect. 
 
 
 
 You look nice. 
 Thanks, Mum. 
 Are those new stockings? 
 Where did you get them? 
 Oh...I've had them ages. 
 I was keeping them for a special occasion. 
 Now, don't you be out too late. 
 Mum... 
 What did Dr Rogers say? 
 Oh...I'm just a bit run down. 
 I'm fine. 
 Oh, I haven't told you. 
 Ben's coming home! 
 Ben? 
 He sent a telegram from Scotland. 
 When's he coming? 
 He should be here any time now. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I haven't seen you. 
 David only told me the other day. 
 Aren't you pleased? 
 Course I am. 
 It's just...I don't want to see him at the moment. 
 Not now. 
 You know how he feels about you. 
 Mum, we haven't seen each other for months. It's not his fault. 
 You should have told me. 
 I have told you. 
 He's a good boy. 
 He'll look after you. 
 You were both so happy. 
 The two of you. At school together. 
 It'll be just like old times, you'll see. 
 Don't wait up, Mum. 
 [ BIG BAND MUSIC ] 
 Girls... 
 Hello, David. 
 Night, night. Thank you, driver. 
 Uncle David. 
 Ben. 
 You look well, you've lost weight. 
 Navy grub. 
 So how come it took you so long? 
 No trains. Troop movements. 
 Well, I can hardly believe you're here. 
 I've missed you. 
 Are you on your own? 
 Who else were you expecting? 
 You know... Where is she? 
 Come on, let's get home. 
 Yeah, but where is she? 
 Well, she's not here, is she? 
 I can see that. 
 I can't tell you what's been going on here. 
 It's... Everything's changed. 
 What? 
 Come on, let's get home. 
 Sir. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I wasn't going to come but I changed my mind. 
 Well, good for you. Not the sort of place I'd expect to see you. 
 I'm just doing my bit for Anglo-American relations. 
 Absolutely. 
 They have wonderful doughnuts. 
 You know what I'm talking about, Jack? See you later. 
 Christopher! 
 John. 
 I'm so pleased you could make it. 
 This is a colleague of mine, Paul Milner. Hello, Paul, welcome. 
 Go grab some chow. 
 Make yourself at home. Have a drink. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you OK? 
 What is it? 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, we're fine, thanks. 
 I'm a doctor. Can I help? 
 It's something I ate. 
 Let's get him into another room. 
 We'll have a look at him. 
 Just take it easy. Nice and slow. 
 [ TUNE ENDS ] 
 [ APPLAUSE ] 
 Come on, one more. 
 [ BAND STRIKES UP SLOW TUNE ] 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 I didn't think you'd come. 
 I said I would, didn't I? 
 You said you would and you said you wouldn't. 
 I'm glad you did. 
 [ TUNE ENDS ] 
 Where's Jimmy? 
 Jimmy? 
 James. Taylor. 
 He's not coming. He's sick. 
 You're lying. 
 I just left him. A minute ago. 
 With a doc. 
 What's wrong with him? 
 Maybe he heard YOU were coming. 
 [ DANCE MUSIC STARTS AGAIN ] 
 So, you want to dance? 
 You'll have to show me. 
 My pleasure. 
 Susan Davies. 
 Her parents live in the village. 
 I spoke to them yesterday. 
 About Will Grayson's death. 
 I wanted to speak to her but she was proving difficult to track down. 
 Was she involved? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'm sure of it. 
 Nylon. 
 I wonder where she got those? 
 You don't think she was involved with any of my men? 
 Well...you have a soldier here name of Taylor? 
 James Taylor. He's a private. 
 Is it possible to talk to him, would you mind? 
 You put me in a very difficult position. 
 If you're suggesting Taylor or any of my men could have been responsible for this...? 
 It does seem a possibility. 
 I'd hate to obstruct you in any way but I have to tell you my first responsibility is to my men. 
 Well, of course. I'm not even sure I can let you speak to them. 
 This is an American base. 
 Theoretically, you are on American soil. 
 Meaning? 
 All I'm saying is that a murder here could have ramifications beyond you and me. 
 Maybe we should let the MPs handle this? 
 Are you asking us to leave? 
 Hell, no. 
 No. I'm just saying... 
 ..this could be more complicated than it seems. 
 Well, a girl is dead. It's my job to find out how it happened. 
 Seems pretty straightforward to me. 
 We should both tread carefully. 
 Some local doc saw me. 
 I went to lie down. 
 After that, I... 
 I guess I fell asleep. 
 Went to lie down where? 
 In my quarters. 
 You didn't see the girl? 
 No. I... 
 I doubt I would have even recognised her if I had. 
 Your quarters lead on to the corridor where she was found. 
 I was...I was asleep there. 
 I didn't see anyone. 
 Door...closed, do you remember? 
 It was open. 
 I was... 
 I was half awake. 
 Half asleep. 
 But... 
 But I heard her out in the corridor. 
 'I don't want to see you now. 
 You shouldn't have come here. 
 Just leave me alone.' 
 Was that all? 
 There was... 
 There was something else. 
 She said something...like... she was still working and... 
 And he could see her later. 
 That was it. 
 He? 
 Whoever. 
 I tried to get up but I couldn't move and... so I think I fell asleep again. 
 Right. 
 You wear identity discs, don't you? 
 Dog tags, sure. Yeah, we all do. 
 Would you mind if I had a look at yours? 
 They're...they're gone. 
 She was engaged. 
 He won't know. 
 We're...we're going to have to tell him. 
 Who's that? 
 His name's Ben Barrett. 
 He used to have a job down at the baker's before the war. 
 The two of them met at school. 
 Barrett? 
 His uncle farms up at Hawthorn Cross. 
 He joined up. 
 They sent him to Iceland. 
 He's coming home on leave. 
 Where are his parents? 
 They were killed two years ago. 
 Bombed in London. 
 Do you mind if we take a look at your daughter's room? 
 Is this Ben? 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 That was taken about a year ago. 
 Being apart must have been hard for them. 
 It's hard for us all, Mr Foyle. 
 Well, yes. 
 Did he ever write? No, he was never much of a one with words. 
 Presents, gifts, did he send anything? 
 No. 
 Where was that taken? 
 It was taken outside the chemical works. 
 Benson's? 
 Yeah. 
 Sir... 
 ..in Bexhill? 
 Yeah. 
 Susan's diary. She always kept one. 
 I don't think she wrote much in it, though. 
 So... 
 Would that be somebody's birthday, maybe? 
 No, her birthday's the 13th. 
 Well, it was the 13th. 
 All right. Mr Davies, we'll find who did this to her. 
 Yes. 
 She had so many dreams, that girl. 
 She wasn't just going to sit around this village for the rest of her life. 
 She wanted to be someone. 
 Now that's all over. 
 Did you enjoy yourself last night? 
 Yes, sir. I did. 
 Until... 
 Yes. 
 Did you see anything? 
 Susan Davies for example? 
 Yes. 
 I saw her arrive. I saw her talking with O'Connor. 
 He wasn't being very friendly. 
 Well, is he ever? 
 Nothing after that? 
 No, sir. 
 I was dancing. 
 Yes, I saw. 
 Well, I didn't see anything. 
 And I was there. Poor girl. 
 I gather you had to treat one of the Americans. 
 A private, yes. 
 James Taylor was his name. 
 What was wrong with him? 
 A nasty attack of gastritis. 
 Can be really crippling. 
 He was in a lot of pain, poor chap. 
 What could have brought that on, do you think? 
 Something he'd eaten, perhaps. 
 Mind you, he'd been drinking too. 
 Anyway, I got him to bed. 
 That was the best place for him. 
 And the dead girl was a patient of yours? 
 Well, everyone in Hilton's a patient of mine. 
 It's a small village and I'm the only doctor. 
 And she came to see you recently? 
 Yes. 
 Because she was pregnant? 
 How did you know that? 
 It was in our doctor's report. 
 Did she say who the father was? 
 No. It wasn't Ben Barrett, that's for sure. 
 I rather fear it was one of our American friends. 
 Well, they do have an eye for the main chance. 
 And it must be said that some of the girls round here have had a bit of a spring in their step since they arrived. 
 Right, but she didn't give you a name? 
 No. But I'll tell you this, she couldn't have been happier about it. 
 She thought this new baby was going to give her a whole new life. 
 Oh, it's very sad. 
 And you're just gonna let him walk in and pin it on us? 
 Think I can do anything about it? 
 Yes, sir, you probably can. 
 Are you hiding something? 
 No. 
 I'd seen her around the village, sure. 
 But I didn't even know her name. 
 What about you, James? 
 Did you know her? 
 No... No, sir. 
 I spoke to her once or twice in the village but... 
 We talk to a lot of Jills. 
 I mean, she liked to hang around. 
 I can't tell you much more than that. 
 What's the story with the dog tags? 
 I don't know, sir. I had them round my neck at the start of the evening. 
 I was sick, I was out of it. 
 What was it you were drinking? 
 I don't know. 
 Some strong...strong stuff. 
 Are you saying someone took the dog tags while you were asleep? 
 I guess they must have. 
 What about the others? 
 Anyone else seen hanging around with this girl? 
 I can ask around, sir, if it'll help. 
 No, that won't be necessary. 
 But when Foyle comes back, which he will, we're gonna have to work with him, OK? 
 I don't see that it's his business, sir. 
 This is a US base. We should leave it to the Snowdrops. 
 It was an English girl. 
 I don't care who she was. 
 He's gonna come in here and try and pin her death on one of us. 
 That's all. 
 Dismissed. 
 Jimmy... Jimmy! 
 What is it? 
 What you said in there. 
 What about it? 
 That you didn't know her. 
 That you only spoke to her now and then in the village. So? 
 That's not true. 
 What difference does it make? 
 She's dead, man. 
 Someone killed her, man. 
 What, you think it was me? 
 O'Connor. 
 What do you want, Farnetti? 
 We should have told him. 
 What do you mean? 
 There's nothing to tell. 
 What about her and Taylor? 
 What about... 
 What about you giving her money? 
 You got a big mouth. 
 Sergeant, we can't just walk away from this. 
 We gotta tell them what we know. 
 It's none of your goddamned business, Private. 
 She was a girl. She got killed. 
 That's the end of it. 
 How did it happen? 
 If you're here, if you're asking these questions, are you saying someone killed her? 
 Is that what you're telling me? 
 She was strangled. 
 Is your nephew here, Mr Barrett? 
 Ben? 
 You're not telling me you think he's got anything to do with it? 
 Is he here? 
 Now, listen to me. 
 You don't have to be a bloody detective to know who did this. 
 It's staring you in the face. 
 The Yanks. 
 They were all there drinking and dancing. 
 It could be any one of them. 
 She was killed at the dance, then, was she? 
 Wasn't she? I presume she went to the dance because the whole village was going. 
 Everyone went. 
 And you? 
 No. 
 But you were seen. 
 I was outside the building, that's true, but I never went inside. 
 So you did go? 
 I went, but when I got there I changed my mind. 
 Taking their food like that. 
 I don't know. 
 I'd enjoy it more if I'd known it had come from Hitler. 
 So I turned around and...came home. 
 Did your nephew go? 
 No. Ben, he was here. 
 His fiancee was there, wasn't she? 
 Did he not know she was there? 
 Well, yes. 
 And it was his first day back on leave, wasn't it? 
 Well, of course he wanted to see her. He was going to go. 
 But he was dog-tired. He'd come all the way down from Iceland then Greenock then here. 
 He had his supper and went to bed. 
 So where is he now, then? 
 Couldn't say. 
 If he shows up, would you ask him to be in touch with us? 
 He'll want to see you. We all will. 
 We all want to know who's done this. 
 Did you believe him? 
 Did you? 
 No. 
 He isn't very fond of Americans, is he? 
 If Susan Davies was having an affair with an American, perhaps he knew? 
 Or maybe Ben Barrett found out? 
 He comes home on leave, finds his girlfriend pregnant by another man. 
 Should we put out an alert? 
 No, we should give him the benefit of the doubt for the time being. 
 Well, then, what are you going to do? 
 I think I'll go to London. 
 I wish I'd never come. 
 You can't just leave. 
 The police were here. 
 Want to see you. 
 I've got nothing to say to them. 
 She's nothing to me any more. 
 Ben... 
 I've only got a week's leave. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Do you really think I want to spend any more of it here after all this? 
 You've got to see them. They were asking questions about you. 
 Now you listen to me. 
 You can't tell them. 
 What? 
 You can't tell them about her. 
 Why not? 
 I know I shouldn't have told you. 
 That's why not. 
 If you tell them that you knew about her and this Taylor you know what they're gonna think. 
 What do YOU think? 
 Where were you last night? 
 I told you. 
 You want me to lie to them? 
 What do you want me to do? 
 I should leave. 
 Where have you been? 
 Actually, sir, I've been having tea. 
 I'm sorry. 
 At 11 o'clock? 
 With Joe Farnetti, an American from the base. 
 Is that the one you were dancing with? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Tell me in the car. 
 I wouldn't normally take time off, sir. 
 He said it was about the case. 
 He knows something. 
 He didn't tell me what. 
 He did say that a lot of the men knew Susan Davies. 
 They were getting stuff from her. 
 Stuff? 
 That's all he said. 
 Sir... 
 I know this isn't the right place or the right time. 
 There's something I've been meaning to tell you. 
 I got a letter from Andrew the other day. 
 And... 
 He's sort of...thrown me over, I'm afraid. 
 He's met someone else. 
 I didn't know that. 
 No, there's no reason why you should. 
 I didn't want to mention it on duty but... 
 He was very nice about it. 
 Very honest. 
 And it's absolutely true that with him in Debden and me over here it really wasn't going to work. 
 But there we are. 
 I just thought you should know. 
 Thank you. 
 I had a feeling you'd be back. 
 It's my job. 
 Want to speak to one of them? 
 Yeah. 
 James Taylor? You've seen him once already. 
 That's right. 
 Have Taylor come up to my office, please. 
 Right away. 
 There you are. 
 [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Mr Taylor. 
 Mr Foyle has some more questions to ask you. 
 Just one. 
 I don't have any more to tell you. 
 Erm... Before you became ill what had you been drinking? 
 Some sort of British stuff. 
 What exactly? 
 Liquor. I don't know exactly what it was. 
 Where did you get it? 
 Answer him, Taylor. 
 Sir... 
 Just do it. 
 O'Connor gave it to me but there was nothing wrong with it. 
 I had too much. 
 Where did he get it? 
 Susan Davies? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 A man is dead and you may have killed him. 
 And Susan Davies has been murdered. 
 You were there. 
 That wasn't me. 
 I swear to you, that was nothing to do with me. 
 Where is it? 
 Where's what? 
 The still. 
 Sir... 
 This way, sir. 
 Cuff him. 
 Give us a minute, would you? 
 Not you, Carter. 
 Sit down. 
 Oww! 
 Sarge... 
 Get him out of here. 
 I was going to get rid of it. 
 I was getting rid of it all. 
 It was never my idea. It was hers. 
 She picked up the know-how when she was at Benson's. 
 She talked me into it. Said it would be a laugh, that's all. 
 It wouldn't do anybody any harm. 
 Industrial strength alcohol, however you disguise it, can cause asphyxia, insanity, blindness, death. 
 No. 
 Will Grayson is dead because of you. 
 It wasn't my fault. 
 He didn't want his father to know what he was doing so he locked the door and drank a bottle of it. 
 The room caught fire but he was blind. 
 Blind drunk. 
 That's what your moonshine had done to him. 
 He called out to his father, "I can't see." 
 But it wasn't the fire. It wasn't the smoke. It was you. No. 
 There was a key right beside the bed. 
 But he couldn't see it to let himself out. 
 You killed him, Mr Carter. 
 No, I told you. 
 It was never my idea. 
 It was the girl. 
 I have stopped. 
 I was going to destroy it. 
 But she threatened me. She said she was gonna tell you I made her do it but it wasn't like that, it was her. 
 She wanted the money. 
 She had these plans. America. 
 How did you get that? 
 What? 
 The thing on your neck. 
 Oh... 
 I was clearing some brambles in the garden. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I never laid a hand on her. 
 I swear to you. 
 I never went anywhere near her. 
 Excuse me, I want to see Mr Foyle. 
 I'm afraid he's not available at the moment, sir. 
 Well, can you tell him David Barrett is here to see him. 
 And can you tell him... 
 I did it. I killed Susan Davies. 
 And can you tell him... 
 I want to confess. 
 I lied to you the last time we spoke. 
 I went to the party like I told you. 
 But I didn't leave. I went inside. 
 And I went in to find her. 
 Because of what she'd done. 
 Not to me. 
 To my boy. 
 I never had any children. 
 Ben was like a son to me. 
 And when I think of him up there in the cold fighting for his King and country while she was... 
 ..seeing someone... 
 A Yank. 
 I told you it'd be one of them. 
 And I was right, wasn't I? 
 I saw him with her. 
 Coming out of the barn. 
 I should have told Ben. Of course I should have told him, but... 
 I couldn't bring myself to do it. 
 He was asleep like I told you and... 
 (SIGHS) 
 Then I decided that I'd deal with it. 
 By killing her? 
 No, no, not kill her. 
 Just to see her to plead with her. 
 Oh, I don't know, I don't know what was going on in my head. 
 I went in the back way. 
 And I ran across her in the corridor. 
 We didn't talk much. 
 She didn't want to see me. 
 And then... 
 Well, then I just lost my temper. 
 That's all there is to it. 
 There's...nothing else to say. 
 Do you know that... 
 ..you could hang for this? 
 I feel sorry for Stan and Mary. 
 I mean, they'd no idea she was like that. 
 They just thought the best of her. 
 I just wish they didn't have to find out. 
 Do you know the name of the American that Susan was seeing? 
 Taylor. 
 Thank you. 
 Any feelings at all for this girl? 
 No, sir. 
 Sir, I didn't... 
 I was just so lonely. 
 I got a girl back home and I missed her so much. 
 And Susan... 
 At first she seemed so friendly. 
 One thing led to another. 
 She wanted me to marry her. 
 That wasn't going to happen. 
 My parents would have killed me. 
 Anyway, I told you, I didn't love her. 
 I know how that sounds. 
 Well, you could have told us all this in the beginning, the night she was killed. 
 The person who did this is still out there, so you haven't helped. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 I was... I was scared. 
 I was ashamed. 
 Mr Barrett? 
 Who are you? 
 We're the police. We've been expecting you to be in touch with us. 
 Yeah? 
 Can we have a word? 
 Please yourself. 
 I don't care what he said. 
 He didn't kill anyone. 
 He wouldn't have hurt Susan. 
 He's known her her whole life. 
 Her mum and dad are his friends. 
 I'm telling you, he didn't do it. 
 Why is he telling us he did, then? 
 I don't know. 
 You tell me. 
 You've just come back from Iceland, haven't you? 
 Yes. 
 Convoys, is that right? 
 I can't talk about it. 
 Would you talk to us about Susan? 
 What? 
 Susan. 
 We met at school. 
 So I gather. 
 I understand you're engaged? 
 We were. 
 Were you aware of the... relationship she was having with one of the Americans? 
 Yes. My uncle told me. 
 Did he? He says he didn't. 
 Uncle David doesn't know what he's saying. 
 Finding that out after being away for so long must have been quite a shock? 
 It wasn't a shock. 
 She was always that way if you want the truth, Mr Foyle. 
 Dreaming. 
 Never happy with what she had. 
 Even at school she wanted to travel, see the world. 
 I often wondered if she'd ever really settle down. 
 And if she did, would it be with me? 
 So...then what did you do? 
 I went to the pub. 
 Which pub was that? 
 The Royal Oak, Hastings. 
 Your uncle told us that you went to bed. 
 Well, he's lying again. 
 He thinks I killed her. 
 Don't you see? 
 He's protecting me because he thinks I did it. 
 Well, I didn't and neither did he. 
 So the two of you are wasting your time. You might as well leave. 
 Mr Barrett, you can go. 
 What? 
 You can leave. 
 I've spoken to your nephew. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying that you're free to...free to go. 
 Making a false confession is construed as wasting police time and obstructing the course of justice but I understand why you did it, so you're free to go. 
 What about Ben? 
 What about him? 
 Didn't he...? 
 No. 
 I thought that he'd killed Susan and I... 
 I thought it was my fault. 
 I did more than that. 
 I wanted him to be angry. 
 I don't know how I could have done that, Mr Foyle, but I wanted him to... 
 I just don't know how I could do that. 
 There's someone else, Ben. 
 He's taken her. 
 He's sweet-talking her. 
 And now...she doesn't want to know you. 
 I told him about her and Taylor. 
 And so God help me, I didn't spare any details. 
 I wanted to make him angry. 
 He's one of these Yanks. 
 They come over here and they don't give a damn about our boys out there fighting the war. 
 They earn twice as much as you do. 
 They've got food, they've got everything. 
 But that's not enough. 
 James Taylor. That's his name. 
 And you should do something about it. 
 So you tried to get him to go to the dance to pick a fight with Taylor? 
 I did. And that's where I thought he'd gone. 
 Not at all what happened though, is it? 
 No. 
 Susan... 
 Susan! 
 Susan? 
 I thought it must have been Ben. 
 I thought he must have come across her. 
 It was my fault. 
 And you took the identity discs? 
 How do you know that? 
 Well, somebody did and it certainly wasn't her. 
 The string wasn't broken so it would have come over Taylor's head not something you're able to do while you're being strangled, perhaps? 
 I was going to leave then I heard some men calling out his name. 
 Taylor, come on! 
 What is he doing in there? 
 Private First Class Taylor, where are you? 
 First Class what?! 
 [ LAUGHTER ] 
 [ DRUNKEN SINGING ] 
 Taylor? 
 I didn't even think about it, actually. 
 It just seemed, well, the right thing to do. 
 I wanted to punish him and protect Ben. 
 I know it wasn't right. 
 It was a wicked thing to do. 
 But to be honest with you, I... 
 I don't know how I could. 
 Who did kill her, Mr Foyle? 
 Do you know? 
 Mr Carter... 
 Yes? 
 We're arresting you for the murder of Susan Davies. 
 You don't have to say anything... 
 No. You can't pin that on me. 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 Sit down. 
 You're wrong. 
 You were heard. 
 Who, who was? 
 Yourself and Susan Davies. 
 Who by? 
 One of the Americans. 
 He was in a room next to the corridor where you killed her. 
 I don't want to see you now. 
 You shouldn't have come here. 
 Please... 
 Just leave me alone. 
 Stop following me. I'm still working, do you understand? 
 So what sort of evidence do you call that? 
 Is that a reason to kill her? 
 No, but he misheard, didn't he? 
 It was nothing to do with her still working but very much to do with keeping your illegal still working. 
 Which was the reason you killed her. 
 Blood was found under her nails. 
 What's that got to do with me? 
 From that. 
 Look, that's not... 
 I told you where I got that. 
 It's your blood. 
 I had to. 
 I had to make her stop. 
 But she wouldn't listen to me. 
 I...I couldn't make her listen. 
 And a man had died. 
 I don't want to see you now. 
 You shouldn't have come here. 
 Listen... 
 Just leave me alone. 
 I'm going to keep the still working, do you understand? 
 What are you doing, get off! 
 No! 
 Get your hands off me! 
 I never meant to hurt her. 
 Sam... 
 Sir? 
 Listen, I should apologise. 
 I've made...judgements about you and your personal life which I had absolutely no right to do and as a result I... 
 I might have spoken out of turn. 
 That's quite all right, sir. 
 I should have said something earlier. 
 Well...I'm sorry about Andrew. 
 It's the war, isn't it? 
 I suppose so. 
 Can I give you a lift home? 
 No. I'll walk. 
 You get an early night. 
 Thank you. 
 And... 
 Have a very good time. 
 Thank you. 
 Goodnight. 
 Christopher! 
 I just missed you at the station. 
 So you've finally caught the killer, eh? Yep. 
 And it wasn't the wicked American? 
 It wasn't. 
 I guess Lord Haw-Haw will be sorry about that. 
 Look... 
 [ TURNS OFF ENGINE ] 
 I might as well come straight out with it. 
 I wanna say I'm sorry, OK? 
 This business about the girl. 
 I'm new here. 
 I know how you British are always murdering each other but I didn't expect to get caught up in it. 
 So... Maybe I behaved like a jerk. 
 Well, you did what you thought was right. 
 Can we put all this behind us? 
 Of course. 
 Good. And in the interests of furthering British/US friendship I happen to have a quart of Jack Daniels in the back. 
 Don't suppose you'd care to come back to base and help me drink it? 
 To help the war effort? 
 Exactly. 
 Don't see why not. 
 Climb aboard. 
 By the way, what's a jerk? 
 Let me explain. 
 Nothing to do with dried meat? 
 Nothing to do with dried meat! 
 That's jerky. 
 That's jerky? 
 OK, look, a jerk is someone who... 
 Not even the Prime Minister knows what we're doing here. 
 They do it to us, we must be prepared to do it to them. 
 You've developed it, what's the cure? 
 I want you to marry me. 
 And I want to never let you go.
