 Same again, then? 
 I don't know, Jack. 
 It's only half past nine. 
 I have to be up at six. 
 Bloody shipyard! 
 You sit on your backside all day. 
 What have you got to worry about? 
 Ted, same again. 
 Come on, gentlemen. You've had enough to drink. Time you went home. 
 He's right, Jack. Come on. 
 I'll walk you home. Get off! 
 Jack. I don't need you to walk me home. I'm not a child. 
 It's not what I meant. 
 Think I'm scared of the dark? 
 Eh? I'll have no fighting in here. 
 Leave quiet, or I'll call the law. 
 I'm not scared of nothing! 
 Come on, Jack. 
 Just get off me. 
 Bloody hell! You don't know what's like to be scared, Derek. 
 You got a nice, cushy number. 
 Shop steward. 
 Suppose someone put a bullet right between your eyes. 
 (Fetch a copper.) 
 Where the hell did you get that? 
 Come on. 
 Put it down. 
 Ticking clock, Derek. 
 Now you know what it feels like. 
 Ten, nine, eight - 
 Excuse me. 
 Scram. 
 I'm with the police actually. 
 Police? 
 Well, sort of. 
 I was having a drink, and I really think you should put that down. 
 Why don't you make me? 
 You won't shoot anybody. 
 We're all on the same side. 
 So why don't you put the gun down? 
 We'll sit and talk it through over another beer. 
 He is not having any more. 
 Come on. 
 You don't want to get in any more trouble, do you? 
 Give me the gun. 
 Do as she says, Jack. Come on. 
 I'm just trying to make a point. 
 That's all. 
 Yes, I think you've made your point. 
 That's him. He was waving a gun. 
 You'd better come with me. 
 What's your name? 
 His name's Jack Archer. 
 REs are you? Come on, then. 
 I'll come, too. 
 I'm his mate. Woodgate. 
 That was very brave of you, miss. 
 Taking him on like that! 
 Not really. 
 I think he was just showing off. 
 And I don't even think it's loaded. 
 Er... 
 Phew! 
 Good morning. 
 Assistant Commissioner Rose for Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle. 
 Is he expecting you, sir? 
 That's neither here nor there. 
 Can you show me to his office? 
 Right this way, sir. 
 Foyle. 
 Commissioner. 
 I hope I'm not interrupting. 
 Since you mention it there are better moments, but - 
 Busy? 
 Yes. 
 What with? 
 Well, er... there's a group operating along the coast here, stealing anything from tyres to steel and timber, and selling it on to private contractors. 
 I can't see the war effort being harmed by the loss of a few tyres. 
 I wouldn't exactly agree. 
 Wouldn't you? 
 No, I wouldn't. 
 Atlantic convoys suffer because shipyards can't patch up vessels when welding plates have gone missing. 
 Trains carrying troops can't run without materials for repairs. 
 Petty crime, but with a significant effect on the war effort. 
 Yeah, yeah. All right. 
 What are you going to do about it? 
 Oh, we've managed to set up a company of builder's merchants operated by ourselves - it's taken us three months to do it. 
 I'm sure you can delegate. 
 Something else has come up. 
 I want you to take charge of it personally. 
 Have you heard... of The People's Convention? 
 Er...left-wing intellectuals based in London... 
 Intellectuals?! 
 They're Communist agitators! stirring up trouble for no reason at all. 
 They talk about people's government, people's peace. 
 Dangerous Fifth Column nonsense. 
 Though not exactly illegal as far as I'm aware. 
 One of their leaders is a man called Raymond Carter. 
 I've had word he's coming down this way. 
 He's booked into the Regency Hotel here in Hastings with his fiancee. 
 I want you to keep an eye on him. 
 I'm a bit short on time, sir. 
 I'm the one who decides what you do with your time. 
 Carter will talk to trade unionists, local councillors. Look here, you're the one talking about railway lines and shipyards. 
 He's a Bolshie firebrand. 
 He could do untold damage, disrupting day-to-day work with his ideas. 
 I can't stop him having meetings. 
 Well... you can arrest him on sedition if the need arises. 
 I remember the need arising to arrest me on sedition not long ago. 
 Well... it was a misunderstanding, eh? 
 Isn't this? 
 That's what I want you to look into. 
 Keep an eye on him. 
 See who he meets. 
 That sort of thing. 
 Then you can report back. 
 And what do you suggest I do with everything else? 
 This comes first. 
 Paul. 
 Can I help you? 
 You're the guvnor, right? 
 That's right. 
 I got word I might be able to help you out. 
 Sorry. I don't have any vacancies. 
 I'm not looking for a job. 
 Then how can you help me? 
 Are you looking for materials? 
 Everyone's looking for materials. 
 Well, not everyone's looking in the right place. 
 What are you after? 
 I've got a job over in Eastbourne. 
 Private air raid shelter. 
 We've dug the hole, but we need to shore it up, put a roof on. 
 Bits and bobs. Have a look. 
 I can get all of this. 
 Where from? 
 Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. 
 That's how the song goes. 
 All right. 
 How much? 
 That's better. 
 £15 up front. 
 And £15 more when I deliver. 
 £15 is a lot of money to give somebody I've never met before. 
 How do I know that I can trust you? 
 Now you're asking silly questions again. 
 All right. Give me your name. 
 You know my name. 
 I think it should work both ways. 
 My name's Kimble. Ian Kimble. 
 How long will it take? 
 We can do it tonight. 
 You'll need a lorry. 
 After work. 
 Eight o'clock, all right? 
 The old transformer factory at the end of Blackwood Lane. 
 I know it. I'll be there. 
 Bring the rest of the money, and I don't want to see anyone with you. 
 I'll need someone to help me carry the stuff. 
 One man. One lorry. 
 That's all you'll need. 
 See where he goes. 
 [ FACTORY SIREN BLARES ] 
 Miss Stewart. 
 I wonder if I could have a word? 
 Don't tell me. I've parked in front of the entrance again. No. 
 No. It's about that business the other night at The King's Head. 
 What? 
 A young lad with a gun. 
 Oh. How did you hear about that? 
 Didn't you get the invitation? 
 Jack Archer. 
 He's the one marrying Gwen? 
 Yes. 
 I've had his name on my mantelpiece. 
 I didn't realise it was that Jack Archer. 
 They were at school together. 
 They've always been sweethearts. 
 Oh, dear. It's a bit embarrassing. 
 You can say that again! 
 Well...he was bit drunk, that's all. 
 I know that. 
 He's a good lad really. 
 So I was wondering if you'd be prepared to put in a word for him. 
 You were there. You know he wasn't really going to hurt anyone. 
 You want me to go to court? 
 I just thought if you went up before the magistrate, as a witness... 
 I'd be glad to. How is Gwen? 
 I haven't seen her for a while. 
 She's been working. That's why. 
 What with this wedding! 
 He's a sapper. 
 I suppose that must put him under a lot of pressure. 
 Oh, yes. It certainly does. 
 It's a 15. 
 Mm-hm. 
 You done the ring? 
 Yep. 
 It's a straight Crabtree, then. 
 Yes. 
 And it's sunny side up. 
 Bit of luck that. 
 Yes, Jack. This is a really marvellously lucky day. 
 I'm stuck in the mud in a big hole with you and a bomb when I could be really unlucky and be taking Margaret Lockwood to tea. 
 Looks like a bad one. 
 What is it, then? 2,000lbs? 
 Have you finished? 
 Yep. 
 Then get the hell out of here and leave me to get on with it. Sir. 
 Do you want me to move these people back? I can do that if you want. 
 Everything all right, then? 
 What? 
 You got the fuse out yet? 
 Ernie, get the char up. 
 He don't talk much. 
 Cos he doesn't hear much. 
 That's why. 
 Typical bloody Jerry, dropping a bomb in a children's playground. 
 I bet they meant it as well. 
 How long will this take? 
 No. Thank you. That's very kind of you, but I can manage it myself. 
 Leonard, really! 
 I can carry my own cases. 
 I don't need the help of a 14-year-old boy. 
 You make a point about everything? 
 Of course. 
 Yes. Mr and Mrs Carter. 
 They telephoned this morning. 
 But they've not arrived yet. 
 I see. Thank you. 
 Good afternoon. 
 My name's Raymond Carter. 
 I made a reservation. 
 Yes, sir. This gentleman was just asking for you. 
 Oh, yes? 
 How do you do. The name's Foyle. 
 But this can wait. 
 I don't think we've met. 
 No. You're right. We haven't. 
 He's a policeman I think. 
 That's right. 
 Ah. Here to check up on me already. 
 That was very quick. 
 No. I was just... making sure you'd arrived safely. 
 You were making sure I'd arrived. 
 Not quite the same thing. 
 I can't talk to you now. 
 We had a rather beastly journey. 
 I need a wash and brush-up as does my wife. 
 Of course. 
 Why not join us for lunch tomorrow, Mr Foyle? 
 You'll want to know what we're up to. We'd be glad to tell you all. 
 That's a splendid idea. 
 Shall we say one o'clock? 
 Kind of you. Thank you. 
 There he is. 
 [ RELIEVED CHATTER ] 
 Well done, sir! 
 Over to you, chaps. 
 There she is. 
 You've got the fuse, then? 
 Yep. The gaine. 
 That's what it's called. 
 Right. You can pull her out now. 
 Remember my clearance certificate. 
 Glad you mentioned it(!) 
 Completely slipped my mind. 
 Thank you. 
 Excuse me. My name's Brenda Wilson. 
 Yes. 
 I live here. Just down the road. 
 And I want you to know I think what you do really is the tops. 
 Thanks. Me and the others have had a whip round. 
 Just to show we're grateful. 
 Hold your hand out. 
 Here we are. 
 You have a drink on us. 
 Thank you. We'll do that. 
 Are you allowed to keep that? 
 No. 
 All money received is paid into the Royal Engineers Association bank. 
 I'll send you the receipt. 
 Twerp! 
 Sir, I think our luck's finally changed. 
 A man called Ian Kimble came to see me this afternoon. 
 He hasn't got a record, but I had him followed. 
 He went back to Talbot's yard. 
 Plenty of stuff there to get his hands on. 
 I got the impression that he was working on his own. 
 I don't think he's part of a gang. 
 Is he on their payroll? 
 I didn't want to check him out in case he saw we were onto him. Right. 
 We're meeting this evening. 
 Can you handle this? 
 Yes, sir. I don't see why not. 
 OK. I'll be at home if you need me. 
 I'm sure we won't, sir. 
 It was a thousand kilos underneath the playground off the high street. 
 Why hadn't it gone off? 
 I don't know. 
 Probably too low. 
 Or it could have been a dodgy fuse. 
 Bloody Jerries! 
 They call themselves the master race and they can't even make a decent bomb. 
 I wish you didn't have to do it. 
 If I had a quid for every time you said that! 
 You should transfer. 
 They won't even consider it for another month. 
 Till then there's only one way out. 
 At least it's quick and painless. 
 Don't say that! 
 Don't ever say that. 
 Maybe they'll lock me up. 
 Mr Hammond says that's what I'm hoping for. 
 Why did you do it, Jack? 
 Why were you carrying a gun? 
 A mate gave it to me. 
 He got it off a German NCO at Dunkirk. 
 He said it would bring me luck. 
 It's done nothing of the sort. 
 I'm still in one piece, aren't I? 
 Evening, Jack. 
 Mr Rivers. 
 You coming in for tea? 
 No, sir. Thanks all the same. 
 You're not going out boozing? 
 Dad! 
 No. I'm gonna go home and get an early night. 
 Will you be at court tomorrow? 
 Of course I'll be there. 
 You taking time off work? 
 They gave me the morning off, Dad. 
 I'm not going to let him be there on his own. 
 See you inside, then. Night, Jack. 
 Night, sir. 
 I told them it was my time of the month. 
 Well, I'll see you, then. 
 I don't know how you could do it. 
 Pulling out a gun! 
 Well...it was a mascot. 
 I didn't even know it was loaded. 
 You're an idiot, Jack Archer. 
 Yeah? 
 How many of you are there? 
 Just me and the driver. 
 I want to see both of you. 
 I've got everything you want. 
 Wood. Steel. 
 Girders. Joists. 
 The lot. 
 Did you bring it here by yourself? 
 What's it matter to you? 
 Where's the dosh? 
 I'm afraid I don't have the money, Mr Kimble. 
 We're police officers and you're under arrest. 
 What?! You lousy bleeder! 
 Stay where you are. 
 Fire that and you'll hang. 
 Back off! 
 Put it down. 
 Get after him! 
 This is Chief Superintendent Foyle for Mr Talbot. 
 Alf! 
 Righto. 
 Very nice to meet you again, Mr Foyle. 
 Yes. It was - 
 It was Sibley Rotary Group. 
 You spoke to us just before Christmas. Right. 
 My brother Peter. Peter heads up the Community Service Committee. 
 Please, won't you sit down? 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, we raised £50 partly thanks to you, Mr Foyle. 
 Oh, good. 
 Yes, for Coventry. 
 What's left of it. 
 I was there in January. 
 It's terrible what the Germans have done. Beautiful cathedral. 
 I was married there, you know. 
 Are you from the Midlands? 
 No. Born and brought up in Saltfleet. 
 So we've been around ships all our lives. 
 How long have you been here? 
 This was the Hannaford Shipyard. 
 We bought it when old John Hannaford died. '37. 
 Never expected to end up at the coal face. 
 The war wasn't part of our business plan. 
 (Bloody war.) Sorry? 
 Bloody waste of time. 
 What did the Poles ever mean to us? 
 Well, Peter and I don't agree on everything. Let's not go into that. 
 How can I help you, Mr Foyle? 
 Have you got an Ian Kimble here? 
 Kimble. That doesn't ring any bells. 
 We have 400 men here. 
 We can't know them all. 
 We've got 400 men and women. 
 We have women riveters. 
 We've got painters. Even welders. 
 Everything's changed. 
 We'll be in prefabrication soon. 
 We've got the Yanks to thank for that. 
 Ian Kimble. 
 Maybe I can help you, Mr Foyle. 
 Yes. Hello. Could you bring in the wages book please, Miss Hargreaves? 
 Thank you. 
 If he's on the payroll, then he'll be in the book. Right. 
 Is that a destroyer I saw out there? 
 Aye. She's in for repairs. 
 We only work for the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping now, but we still work hell for leather. 
 Round the clock! 
 Ships get beaten up in the North Atlantic. We have to get 'em out. 
 Tomorrow isn't soon enough. 
 We have people working 14-hour days. 
 When the unions let us. 
 Thank you, Miss Hargreaves. 
 Thank you. 
 Right. Let's have a look. 
 Please, Mr Foyle, come and see. 
 That's 1-19. 
 And...Keane, Kettle, Killick. 
 There we are. Kimble. 
 Yes. He works in the storeroom. 
 Would you like me to call him up? 
 No. Not necessary. 
 Got an address for him? 
 Yes. 37 Orchard Street. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 May I ask what he's done, Mr Foyle? 
 Well... have you had a problem with stock going missing at all here? 
 No. No, we keep an inventory of everything. We run a tight ship. 
 Nothing goes out of here without our knowing about it. 
 Right. Thank you very much. 
 Thank you. 
 Any way we can be of help, you just give us a call. 
 Thank you. 
 Miss Hargreaves will see you out. 
 Thank you. 
 He's a fine member of my squad. 
 I'd like to say that since he joined me he's been involved in 28 UXBs, one exploded killing an officer and wounding several others. 
 His behaviour at The King's Head was totally out of character. 
 He was intoxicated. 
 Yes, ma'am, but if you'd been in a hole with 1,000 kilograms of high explosive and a ticking fuse between your legs, you might need a drink, too. 
 Thank you. 
 I understand there's a further witness here. 
 A Miss Stewart. 
 I hereby swear by almighty God to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
 You're with the police? 
 Yes, ma'am. I'm a police driver. 
 And you were at the public house on the night in question? 
 Yes. But I have to tell you Jack Archer didn't mean anything by it. 
 He was aiming a loaded pistol at another man's head. 
 Yes, but he didn't know it was loaded. 
 And he wasn't really aiming. 
 That is not true! 
 Thank you, Mr Roberts. 
 Miss Stewart, you're contradicting everything we've been told. 
 Well, what I mean is... he was waving the gun at everyone and everywhere, but...well, he certainly didn't aim it at me. 
 What! 
 He pointed the gun at me when he gave it to me, but he had no intention of firing it. 
 And may I say, ma'am, that Corporal Archer is a hero. 
 And what he's doing is quite marvellous. 
 And I would be quite ready to go to prison in his place. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 Well, I was the one who fired the gun in the end. 
 You fired the gun?! 
 Accidentally. Nobody was hurt. 
 Thank you, Miss Stewart. 
 Corporal Archer, you have committed a very grave breach of the peace. 
 The fact you were carrying a firearm is particularly serious. 
 In normal circumstances you would be facing a jail sentence. 
 However, we accept that you have been working under severe mental strain. 
 And in this instance one of the witnesses may have done more damage than yourself. 
 The weapon has been surrendered? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Then we are dismissing you with a caution. 
 You may resume your duties. 
 You all right, son? 
 Don't you get yourself in any more trouble, Jack Archer. 
 What about you? 
 They'll dock you a day's pay. 
 I don't mind. I wasn't going to let you be here on your own. 
 Ahem! Sorry to interrupt you, Corporal. 
 What was it now. Oh, yes. Of course, There's a war on. 
 Come on. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 Hello, Gwen. How are you? 
 Sam. 
 Better now. Thanks to you. 
 Thank you for what you said. 
 I was glad to help. 
 And congratulations! 
 Oh, the wedding. 
 Thanks. Are you coming? 
 Am I coming? 
 Of course. 
 I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
 I don't suppose you fancy a cup of tea and a sandwich or something? 
 We're only round the corner. 
 As long as your father doesn't report me to Mr Foyle. 
 I'm absent without leave, too. 
 Come on. This way. 
 I was at the yard where you work today. 
 An investigation? 
 Stolen supplies. 
 I don't suppose you know a man called Ian Kimble, do you? 
 No. 
 But there's loads of people there, though. 
 What exactly do you do? 
 Promise you won't laugh. 
 I'm a welder. 
 Why would I laugh? 
 That's marvellous. 
 I quite enjoy it. 
 It's more fun than my last job. 
 Better paid. 
 I still get less than the men, though. 
 I bet. 
 It's not fair really. 
 I'm just as good as them. 
 I learned about it in my last job. 
 The cake shop? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't see the connection. 
 Welding's a bit like icing cakes. 
 Though I shouldn't be talking about cakes right now. 
 Oh, yes. The wedding. 
 Yeah. Two weeks away. 
 I don't know what we're gonna do. 
 It's good to see you. 
 And you. 
 Next time you'll come to the yard? 
 Do you think I'd be welcome? 
 Like I was telling you there's a lot of us who believe in what you're saying. 
 And, well, things will change. 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Yes. 
 I've booked a table in the hotel restaurant. Right. 
 We can't have a cake for the wedding. 
 Well, we can, but we're not allowed icing. 
 There's a Sugar Order, would you believe it! 
 We can have chocolate, but it's not the same. 
 Mm. 
 I can't get confetti either, so I've got the girls in the office saving up the little bits of paper you get from punches - paper punches. 
 We've had to fight to get film for the photographs. 
 Why don't you wait until after the war's over? 
 That's what Dad says. 
 I can't wait for Jack. 
 You know, the work he does. 
 If we wait, he'll... 
 ..we might... never... 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I love him. 
 I've always loved him. 
 I just...I just want... 
 I'm sorry, Gwen. 
 I didn't mean to upset you. 
 Here. Have a hanky. 
 I'm sure you'll get through it all right. 
 There were fewer bombs last week. 
 Maybe the Germans are running out. 
 I haven't even got a maid of honour. 
 Jenny's in America. 
 She can't come over. 
 Why don't you ask one of the welders? 
 In fact you could have a whole bunch of them standing outside the church, wielding their welding rods. 
 It's a registry office. 
 You don't need a cake. 
 You don't need anything. 
 As long as you have each other. 
 I don't suppose... 
 I suppose I should have thought of you in the first place really, but would you be my maid of honour? 
 If it weren't for you, Jack might not even be free to get married. 
 Of course. I'd be delighted. 
 Really? 
 Yes. Why not? I love weddings. 
 My father's a vicar. 
 I know Jack would be pleased. 
 He was grateful for you turning up the way you did. 
 There's only one problem. 
 Maid of honour. 
 How am I going to get a dress? 
 I'm very glad you agreed to join us, Mr Foyle. 
 If you're going to investigate us, this is the more civilised way. 
 How did you know by the way that I was a policeman, Miss...? Sheridan. 
 But please call me Lucinda. 
 It was a lucky guess really. 
 Although I do know a thing or two about authority figures. 
 Lucinda Sheridan the artist? 
 You know my work? 
 I do. 
 My wife was a watercolourist. 
 Are you investigating us? 
 No. I'm just interested in why you're here. 
 Well, we're holding a series of meetings. Informal... 
 The People's Convention? 
 We want improved living standards, air raid shelters. 
 I don't see any crime in that. 
 Well, there isn't. 
 But you're also demanding self-determination for the colonies, restoration of trade union rights, friendship with the USSR. 
 You've been doing your homework. 
 And at a time like this, in a defence area like this, political activity such as this could be construed as provocative. 
 The government has been throwing the rulebook at us. 
 Regulation 2D. They used it to close down The Daily Worker. 
 The one paper that really supported us. 
 Artists and writers are banned by the BBC. 
 Alan Bush, one of our sympathisers. 
 They got rid of JB Priestley. 
 They're running scared. 
 This war is a mess. They know it. 
 They got us into it. And we're all suffering as a result of it. 
 You're perfectly entitled to your opinion, far be it for me to try to stop you. 
 So why are you here, then? 
 Come on, Mr Foyle. 
 You think I don't see it. 
 Getting friendly with us so you can what? 
 Arrest us in the middle of the night? 
 You're just a small cog in the government machine. 
 Raymond. The real war going on at the moment is a class war. 
 The people who are getting slaughtered in France and Africa are being sent there by officers who owe their rank simply to the public schools they attended. 
 We're all being kept in our place. 
 That's why you're here. 
 Thank you for the invitation, but I've a feeling you'd enjoy your lunch a little better without me. 
 Afraid to be seen with me. 
 Well, you wouldn't be the first. 
 Mr Carter. Miss Sheridan. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Mr Foyle, I wanted to apologise to you. 
 Raymond was very offensive just now. 
 He believes passionately in The People's Convention. 
 Sometimes he gets carried away. 
 But he's a good man. 
 He's as against the Nazis as anyone. 
 I'm sure. 
 People have written horrible things about him. 
 He was a journalist, but nobody will publish what he writes any more. 
 They call him a defeatist. 
 A Communist. 
 But we went to Coventry together. 
 We saw what had happened there. 
 The suffering of the people. 
 He can't bear the thought that it'll happen again. 
 Maybe here. 
 You think I don't feel the same? 
 Of course not. Raymond shouldn't have spoken to you like that. 
 It would certainly make my life a lot easier if you and Mr Carter felt able to return to London at your earliest convenience. 
 Is that a warning? 
 No, no, no. Just a suggestion. 
 Sam. 
 Sir. 
 How did you get on? 
 Oh. Fine, sir. They let him off. 
 Well done. 
 Sir. 
 How's the arm? 
 Oh. Hardly notice it. 
 I don't know why I've got all this. 
 Ian Kimble. Nothing from the Department of Labour. 
 He hasn't been issued with an identity card or ration books. 
 The address he gave doesn't exist. 
 I finally found an Ian Kimble. 
 I checked with Somerset House. 
 He's a local man. Born in 1920. 
 And? 
 Died when he was 17. 
 He's buried at St Mark's. 
 Right. 
 We didn't expect to see you so soon. 
 Not that you're not very welcome. 
 Anything we can do to help? 
 We've checked the main inventory. 
 I checked it. Nothing astray. 
 What can we do for you? 
 It's this man Ian Kimble. 
 He didn't clock in this morning. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 He's been dead for four years. Sorry? 
 He was just using the name. I'd like to speak to his fellow workers. 
 You're more than welcome to try, but there's no-one here that knows him very well. 
 What sort of identification did he give when you employed him? 
 The usual papers. I suppose they could have been false. 
 How was he paid? 
 Cash in an envelope at the end of the week. He'd have signed for it. 
 [ AIR RAID SIREN ] 
 Let's continue this conversation. in the shelter, Mr Foyle. 
 It never bloody ends! 
 [ KLAXON BLARES ] 
 [ AIR RAID SIREN CONTINUES ] 
 Sam! 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 This way. Come on. This way. 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 As quick as you can. 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 I don't like it. 
 It's those shakes. 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 [ PHONE RINGS ] 
 Captain Hammond here. 
 Right. Thank you so much. 
 Jack, Ernie, terribly sorry to interrupt your tea break, but we've had a call out, category A1. Where? 
 The shipyard. Talbot's. 
 Ernie, can you get the lads? 
 It's the Bomb Squad, sir. 
 Hasn't the bomb gone off yet? 
 Doesn't look like it. 
 Mark and I had better go in and check the damage. 
 Is that a good idea? 
 What is this place? 
 Part of the old shipyard. Hasn't been used for years. Been derelict - 
 Shouldn't we clear this area? 
 Yes. We will see to that. 
 Who's in charge? 
 It's Archer. The man with the gun. 
 This is our shipyard. 
 Get these people back 100 yards. 
 Why are you going in there? 
 Since you have a UXB in there it seems a good idea. 
 There is no UXB. It went off. 
 You can see for yourself. 
 If the bomb had gone off, all the windows would be blown out. 
 No scorch marks. No splinter damage. 
 What's inside? 
 Old boats. Hulls. Relics. 
 Nothing of any value. 
 Right we'll take a look. 
 Will you move back? Please. 
 You two, with me. 
 It's a Herman. 
 At least it's sunny side up. 
 Makes life a little easier. 
 Jack, look at this. 
 Not now, Ernie. 
 No. Take a look. 
 Bloody hell! 
 Pssst! 
 Bomb's over here, chaps. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 How much do you reckon? 
 I don't know. A grand. Ten maybe. 
 Fifty more like. 
 I have to say, Mr Foyle, this does put things into perspective. 
 What do you mean? 
 It was no accident the bomb falling here. We're obviously the target. 
 It makes you think. 
 We're in the front line. 
 An attack like this, it's life and death. 
 It makes a few missing supplies seem like small beer by comparison. 
 I agree, but didn't you tell me there are no missing supplies? 
 But there's a better time for this. 
 I'll be back. 
 You have men posted at bus and railway stations looking for Kimble? 
 Yes, sir. And there are road-blocks on the main roads. 
 We should get a list of everyone working in the storeroom. Sir. 
 So, did you find anything? 
 Yes, sir. Quite a big thing as a matter of fact. A Herman. 
 Not hard to spot. 
 What's a Herman? 
 A 1,000 kilogram bomb. 
 Can't think how it got there. 
 It may have fallen through the roof! 
 Can you defuse it? 
 It's a tricky one. 28A fuse. 
 Anti-disturbance. 
 The slightest vibration could set it off. So nobody cough. 
 What's your name, Captain? 
 Ralph Hammond. 
 You seem to take this all very lightly. 
 It's all in a day's work, isn't it? 
 Corporal, we'll need a quilter key. 
 What's that? 
 It's a tool designed to unlock the cap which gives us access to the fuse. 
 And if it works, we can all go home for tea. 
 And if it doesn't? 
 I'd appreciate it if you'd go away, sir. Far away. 
 Captain Hammond. 
 All right. Come along, Peter. 
 Whatever you say. 
 
 
 
 What are you doing home this time? 
 Didn't you hear? There was a raid. 
 We were sent home early. 
 Did you cop one? 
 Yeah, but it didn't go off. 
 Have you been in here all day? 
 Where else am I gonna go? 
 I've been thinking. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 London. That is the answer. 
 London? How are you even going to get out of Hastings? 
 I was down the station. 
 There were police everywhere. 
 I'll go by bus. 
 They're stopping the buses. 
 They're stopping all the cars. 
 You should never have got yourself mixed up in all this. Yeah (!) 
 What are you going to do if you even get there? 
 You've got nowhere to go. 
 I'll go to Aunt Dot's. 
 She'll put me up. 
 You won't get to London. 
 You won't get anywhere near. 
 You've got to turn yourself in. 
 It's only a load of wood. 
 I can't turn myself in. 
 It's six months. 
 You've been inside before. 
 Maybe they'll go easy on you. 
 Forget it! 
 I shot a copper. 
 What?! 
 I didn't know what I was doing. 
 It was self-defence. 
 Bill, I don't believe this. 
 Did you kill him? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, somebody had bloody better find out. 
 I wasn't thinking. 
 You can say that again! 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Like I said. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 They won't find you. 
 They don't know who you are. 
 But we need to know about the copper. 
 Do you think they're gonna put it in the newspapers? 
 No. 
 But I know someone. 
 She'll tell me. 
 I'm so glad you're going to be there, Sam. 
 I still don't know what I'm going to wear with rationing. 
 11 coupons for a dress! 
 They still take margarine coupons. 
 I haven't got any left. 
 I'll get Mum to run you up something. 
 She's making me a dress out of butter muslin. 
 I'm not sure I look my best in butter muslin. 
 They say Reed & Pettigrew will turn a blind eye. 
 But your father would have to arrest them. 
 We're not having any of that. 
 Well, at least we'll have a proper spread. 
 I went down to the food office today to get permits for the extra food. 
 Half a pound of butter for 20 guests. That won't go far. 
 Stop grumbling, Dad. 
 You don't want me to get married cos you won't have me looking after you any more. 
 Where is your young man? I thought you were seeing him this evening. 
 He didn't turn up. 
 That's not like him. 
 Maybe he was embarrassed after what happened. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 I'm surprised he didn't call. 
 I saw him at the dockyard just after the bomb fell. 
 I heard he was down there. 
 I didn't dare go and look. 
 Where is he? 
 I don't know, Dad. 
 I'm sure he'll turn up. 
 It's wrong. 
 Yes, Jack, I think we've got the message. 
 No. What I'm saying is - 
 I know what you're saying. 
 But it's too late. 
 We decided. The three of us. 
 It's wrong. 
 I'm going back to the billet. 
 You haven't finished - 
 I've had enough of this. I'm off. 
 You should go after him. 
 Why? You're the one I'm worried about, Jack. 
 This sudden attack of conscience. 
 For Pete's sake! You're getting married in a week. Cheer up. 
 'Foyle? He was here already?' 
 'Twice. He was here yesterday.' 
 He was here about Raymond Carter? 
 Raymond Carter. No. 
 No, I haven't heard of him. 
 He was asking about stolen materials, petty pilfering. 
 I see. Of course. Yeah. 
 Well, I'm afraid we're at cross purposes. 
 That's not why I'm here. 
 Glad to hear it. 
 I thought Mr Foyle was wasting his time. And ours. 
 Thank you. 
 So why are you here? 
 Is is something about this man you mentioned? 
 Thank you. 
 This man you mentioned. Carter. 
 He's a leftwing agitator. 
 He's a member of an organisation calling itself The People's Convention. 
 I haven't heard of them either. 
 We're working 24 hours in 24. 
 We've no time for politics. 
 So you haven't noticed any upsurge in what I might loosely describe as industrial unrest? 
 Well, as a matter of fact there have been certain developments recently. 
 I had a meeting with one of our shop stewards - Derek Woodgate. 
 He's a troublemaker. 
 By and large we've had no problems with the unions. 
 They support the war. 
 Good for them, Mr Rose. 
 But certain individuals in the rank and file give us the most trouble. 
 You mean strikes? 
 Strikes have been illegal since last year but it doesn't stop them. 
 One day strikes and lock-outs. 
 We've lost so many man hours. 
 Nobody does anything about it. 
 There have been no prosecutions. 
 This Woodgate, has he threatened you with strike action? 
 No, no. Not in so many words. 
 But now he wants to set up what he calls a works committee. 
 No need to say who'll be its head. 
 We met him here. There was something about the way he spoke to us. 
 Yeah. You think he's been got at? 
 No doubt about it. 
 Even his language. 
 It was socialism, the class war, the proletariat. 
 Now this man you were asking about, Raymond Carter. 
 Is he in Hastings? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 Well... a man like Woodgate, given the right ammunition, could do us much damage to us as the whole of the Luftwaffe. 
 We had a raid only yesterday. 
 Your Mr Foyle seems to have his head buried in the sand. 
 We are fighting a war. 
 All he was interested in was a handful of missing supplies. 
 There were two men. 
 One driving. 
 They must have been waiting outside the pub. 
 When the other man came out they hit him on the head and dragged him in the car. 
 I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 
 It was like something out of those Hollywood films. 
 You know, Jimmy Cagney. 
 "You dirty rat!" 
 Did you get a look at the registration plate? 
 No. I'm sorry. 
 I just wanted to get home. 
 I didn't see anything very much. 
 The King's Head? 
 We all go in after work sometimes. 
 It's just down the road. 
 Right. 
 Thank you, Miss Wright. 
 I thought it was some sort of joke. 
 But I had to tell someone about it. 
 Thank you. 
 And in Hastings of all places! 
 Whatever next? 
 This way. 
 There were three of them. 
 Archer, Hammond, and Jonesy. 
 I had a right go at him. Expecting me to give him change of a fiver! 
 He gave you a £5 note? 
 Yeah. 
 His old aunt must have left him the yacht and the castle an' all. 
 It wasn't that so much. He looked really upset about something. 
 I reckon they'd had a barney. 
 Then he got up and left. 
 Never even finished his pint. 
 Thank you. 
 Ow! 
 Sorry. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. It's just a spark. 
 You need to bathe it. 
 Shall I get some cold tea? 
 No. I'm all right. I'm all right. 
 No. Let me. 
 I hate all these new compound welds. 
 It's all in the cooling. 
 I know. 
 I always leave it too late and the metal gets all lumpy. 
 Is that better? 
 Yeah. Cheers. 
 Hardly worth it, though, is it? 
 Not even three quid a week! 
 No. 
 I don't. Thanks. 
 I forgot. 
 So did you hear anything about that business, then? 
 What? 
 The stuff that was pinched. 
 It was taken from the storeroom. 
 Where did you hear about that? 
 I don't know. 
 I heard someone saying. 
 They said a policeman was shot. 
 Never! Your dad's a police sergeant, isn't he? 
 I thought you'd know all about it. 
 He never talks about his work. 
 So you don't know if he's all right, then? 
 Who? 
 The policeman. 
 I didn't even know anyone was shot. 
 Why are you asking? 
 Just gossip. 
 I hate this place. 
 I was happier at the foundry. 
 So how did you end up here? 
 Like a BF I volunteered. 
 Is your eye all right, then? 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 I'll get back, then. 
 You're in one piece. 
 Luck of the devil. 
 When I started in Bomb Disposal we had an average life of seven weeks. 
 That was nine months ago. 
 And you volunteered? 
 It may surprise you, but I did. 
 I was in the Nancy Elsie, the Non-Combatant Labour Corps. 
 I was a pacifist. 
 I suppose I still am. 
 But I was a civil engineer before the war. 
 I felt this was the only work I could do without compromising what I believed in. 
 What about Jones? 
 He fell into it by accident. 
 Wanted to join the Royal Engineers because he thought it'd be safe. 
 Mending bridges. That sort of thing. 
 Nasty surprise when they transferred him here. 
 Do you have any idea where he might be? 
 None at all. 
 Where does he live? 
 He's billeted here. 
 His bed wasn't slept in. 
 Does he have another address? 
 Is there a wife, or a parent? 
 His parents are in Cumbria I think. 
 He has no lady friend. 
 Poor Ernest got banged about a bit. 
 He's not very sociable. Meaning? 
 He and another sapper, a chap called McClaren, were digging up a bomb buried in an allotment just the other side of Hastings. 
 Ernest went to get a glass of water, and as he left there was a bang, and he was thrown 12 feet into the air. 
 We don't know how it happened. 
 He wasn't hurt except for his ear drums. 
 He can still hardly hear, but I suppose he was lucky. 
 We never found anything of McClaren. 
 Two men were seen dragging Jones into a car last night. 
 I don't believe it. 
 There was a witness. It happened just outside The King's Head. 
 Why Ernest? 
 There couldn't be any reason. 
 I'm sure you've got the wrong man. 
 He's probably out walking on the beach or something. He'll show up. 
 Gwen! What are you doing here? 
 Hello, Dad. 
 Everything all right? 
 Yes. I wondered if Sam was around. 
 You shouldn't be bringing private matters into the station. 
 It's nothing to do with the wedding. 
 Have you seen Jack? 
 No. Look, I think I might be able to help. 
 This business down at the shipyard. 
 What do you know? 
 What Sam told me. 
 Then she's talking out of turn. 
 Dad - 
 Gwen. 
 Sam, thank goodness you're here. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 This is my daughter Gwendoline. 
 Ah. Getting married. Is that right? 
 Yes. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you, Mr Foyle. 
 I'm a bit nervous. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 I wonder if I could have a word? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Her name's Joanne Mason. 
 She never speaks to me, but this time she was being really pally, asking me questions. 
 She was asking me about that policeman who was shot. 
 This is him. 
 Oh. Are you all right? 
 I was lucky. 
 Oh. Well, she didn't know that. 
 Well, she was asking me questions about Dad, if he knew anything. 
 Sam told me you were after someone who'd been thieving, but it's funny, cos Joanne knew the stuff had come from the storeroom. 
 Well, I didn't know that. 
 No-one did. So that set me thinking. 
 How could she know? 
 Does she have a husband or boyfriend working at the yard? 
 I don't really know her that well. 
 But I have seen her with a man a couple of times. 
 Can you describe him? 
 Medium height. Quite dark skin. 
 Greying hair. 
 He's got a sort of crooked nose. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 So real name William Mason. 
 Three months hard labour for aggravated burglary and assault. 
 Two spells in borstal. Been in and out of trouble all his life. 
 You should stay in the car, don't you think? Sir. 
 [ KNOCK AT THE DOOR ] 
 Mrs Mason? 
 Yes. 
 Can I have a word with your husband? 
 He's not here. Who are you? 
 The name's Foyle. I'm a policeman. 
 I haven't seen Bill for a while. 
 He's gone away. 
 No! You leave him alone! 
 Move! 
 Everything all right, sir? 
 It certainly is, Rivers. 
 Sorry to spoil it for you, sir, but you've got a visitor. 
 Assistant Commissioner Rose, sir. 
 He's back. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 Ah. There you are, Foyle. 
 Back again, sir? 
 What can I do for you? 
 You have disregarded my orders. 
 Have I? 
 I asked you to investigate Raymond Carter. 
 I have. 
 I hear you had a cosy lunch with him. 
 That's not the same thing. 
 Nothing to investigate. 
 I beg to differ. I've just visited the Talbot brothers. 
 I've seen them a couple of times, too. 
 What you saw them about is neither here nor there. 
 While you were rummaging in their store cupboards they were facing a series of strikes which could paralyse their shipyard! 
 A shop steward called Derek Woodgate has been in talks with Carter. 
 Their Bolshie efforts could bring a vital industry to a standstill. 
 They have that much influence? 
 Remember the Communists are just as much our enemies as the Nazis. 
 I want you to drop whatever it is you're doing and deal with this man. 
 Find out about his associates. 
 While you're at it search his room. 
 His hotel room? 
 Where else? Why? 
 We have to find the evidence. 
 Regulation 18B. 
 Detention without charge. 
 I'm aware of it. 
 Well, use it! 
 Oh! 
 Who are you? 
 Samantha Stewart, sir. 
 Mr Foyle's driver. 
 Ridiculous. 
 Sorry to interrupt, sir. 
 Not at all. Glad you did. 
 I brought you the information on the British watercolourists. Thanks. 
 I wonder if you'd mind telling me what you'd be doing with these? 
 What are they? 
 Photos of Talbot's Shipyard. 
 What has all this got to do with me? 
 We just found them in your room. 
 You searched my room? 
 Mm. 
 This sort of work does you no credit at all, Mr Foyle. 
 I agree. 
 I've never seen these in my life. 
 I see. Being in possession of photographs like these in normal circumstances would lead to an arrest. 
 Is that why you placed them there? 
 But as it is I'm sorry to have disturbed you. 
 You're not going to arrest me? 
 No. Thank you. 
 They've got pits production committees in the mines, then why not yard committees here? 
 Just because there's a war on doesn't mean you can't have a voice. 
 It's because of the war that the management doesn't want to listen. 
 Let me tell you something. 
 We will have a committee. 
 We'll have one here. 
 And they're going to listen! 
 [ CHEERS ] 
 Thanks very much. 
 Derek Woodgate? 
 Yes. 
 The name's Foyle. I'm a policeman. 
 I saw you at the hotel, didn't I? 
 That's right. 
 You were with Raymond Carter. 
 That's right. What can I do for you? 
 Would you have given him any photographs - photographs of this dockyard? 
 Why would I do that? 
 It was a personal meeting. 
 Was the meeting related to... your work at all here? 
 Not really. 
 I went because I admire what he does. 
 Do you belong to The People's Convention? Yes. 
 You're a shop steward here? 
 Yes. 
 How many union members are here? 
 In the shipyard? 
 143. 
 So what, about half the workforce? 
 Your maths isn't up to very much, Mr Foyle. 
 There are just over 200 people at Talbot's. 70% are with me. 
 Right. 
 Does the name Ian Kimble mean anything to you? No. 
 William Mason? 
 Yeah. I've heard of him. 
 He's in Supplies. 
 What about these? 
 Mark Kelly. 
 Des Parker. I know both of those. 
 I've never heard of the others. Why? 
 Right. No, that's it. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, Mr Foyle. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you paid to do this? 
 Yeah. 
 So are we. 
 So are the Talbots. 
 They might pretend they're doing it for the war, but they're raking it in. 
 They make us work all hours. 
 They bring women in to do our jobs at half the rate. 
 They have orders coming in left and right. 
 But they're not doing it for the war. 
 Oh, no. 
 They're doing it to get rich. 
 You should remember that, Mr Foyle. 
 I will. 
 Good day to you. 
 What? 
 Look, there's something I want to talk to you about. 
 It's awkward. 
 I can't go into details. 
 You've changed your mind. You don't want to go ahead with it. 
 No! 
 Well, what, then? 
 I haven't changed my mind. 
 I still love you. 
 It's just... we're going to have to think about postponing it. 
 The wedding? 
 You're not serious. We can't! 
 Look, something's happened. 
 Something good. 
 I did it for you, and if it works out you and me will be set up for life. 
 You're not making any sense, Jack. 
 I'm not supposed to talk about it. 
 Says who? 
 Captain Hammond. 
 They still haven't found Ernest. 
 I didn't know he'd scarpered. 
 He hasn't. He's disappeared. 
 When? 
 Look, I want you to think about it, postponing. 
 I won't think about it. 
 We may have to. 
 I want to be with you, Gwen, you know I do. 
 It's just... 
 ..right now it's out of my hands. 
 Jack, you're frightening me. 
 You'll be fine. 
 I love you. 
 It'll work out in the end. 
 Bloody hell! Mr Hammond, sir! 
 Are you sure Mason worked on his own? 
 Yes, sir. 
 It certainly looks like that. 
 And his wife? 
 She was working at Talbot's as well. 
 That does seem that's where everything begins and ends. Yes. 
 They went back to the warehouse. 
 Yes? 
 There was nothing in there. 
 Mark Talbot was telling the truth. 
 But I found these next to the crater. 
 It's explosive. 
 Mm. That's what I thought. 
 I presume it's German. 
 It just seems strange to me. 
 That the Engineers should have left it behind? 
 Mm. A bit clumsy. So they dismantled the bomb when they were there. 
 I thought they just removed the fuse and blew it up later. 
 [ KNOCK AT THE DOOR ] 
 Yes? 
 Sir... 
 Cigarette burns. 
 Looks like it. 
 I can't understand it. 
 Poor Ernest. 
 Who'd want to do that to him, do you think? 
 I really don't know. 
 Maybe he was gambling. 
 Maybe he was seeing somebody's wife. 
 There are a dozen men here. 
 He was just one of them. 
 Tell me about the bomb at the dockyard. 
 It was a Herman. We give them names. 
 Fritz is 1,400 kilograms. 
 Herman is 1,000kgs. 
 Had a single fuse, and probably wasn't meant to blow up at once. 
 The Jerries do it on purpose now. 
 They realised a UXB causes more havoc and disruption than a simple bang, plus there's the uncertainty of it. 
 Undermining civilian morale. 
 A war of nerves. 
 Sir. 
 You defused it? 
 We had no choice. 
 It was A1 category. 
 Immediate disposal essential. 
 Detonation of the bomb in situ unacceptable in any terms. 
 But you opened it up. 
 What makes you say that? 
 You've been back. 
 The shell casing had split. 
 It's probably leaked out. 
 Where is it now? 
 We blew it up. 
 A few miles down the coast. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 You have to tell them. 
 It's rather too late for that, Jack. 
 You know that as well as I do. 
 We're just going to have to do what we do best. Keep our nerve. 
 I don't know what's wrong with him. 
 He's never been like that before. 
 It was probably last-minute nerves. 
 What, postponing the wedding? 
 Maybe it had something to do with Sapper Jones. 
 Ernest? What about him? 
 Of course, you haven't heard. 
 What? 
 I'm afraid he was killed. 
 What? 
 It happened last night, I think. 
 A bomb? 
 No. It's rather worse than that. 
 Mr Foyle is having to investigate. 
 It looks as though he may have been murdered. 
 Jack knew something was wrong. 
 That's what he was trying to tell me. 
 Do you think Jack could be involved? 
 Sam, you must promise me you mustn't say anything to Mr Foyle or to my dad. 
 I don't know, Gwen. 
 I've known Jack all my life. 
 He would never do anything wrong. 
 I don't know what's going on, Gwen. 
 I really don't. 
 But I hope you're right. 
 [ DOOR OPENS ] 
 Mr Evans. 
 You've heard, then? 
 I don't understand it. 
 People killing each other in war time! 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 And to do that to a man who's a blinking hero! 
 Well, don't you worry, my love. 
 We'll find whoever did it. 
 Mr Foyle will. 
 I can promise you that. 
 Where is it? 
 You killed Ernest Jones. 
 We did nothing of the sort. 
 Where is it? 
 If I'm not back in my barracks unharmed 20 minutes from now your money goes up in flames. 
 Where is the money? 
 Where did you get it? 
 What was it doing there? 
 That's our business. 
 You're thieves. 
 There's only one thief round here, Captain Hammond. 
 Let's get to the point, shall we? 
 I appreciate now I shouldn't have taken the money. 
 I'm prepared to give it back. 
 Very sensible. 
 But I have to be sure I won't end up like Jones. 
 Why should we want to harm you? 
 We just want what's ours. 
 All right. 
 I'll return it to you. 
 Minus £250. 
 £100 for me. £100 for Archer. 
 £50 for Jones's mother. 
 Something to bury him with. 
 Sorry. 
 Why should we pay you anything? 
 It buys my silence. At least I get something out of this. 
 There's so much there you're not going to notice it. 
 All right. Agreed. 
 So where is the money? 
 I'll call you tomorrow. 
 I'll take the money somewhere safe. 
 It'll just be me and a suitcase. OK? 
 Right. 
 Better go. 
 Archer's waiting for me. 
 Foyle. 
 Sir. 
 Progress? 
 Er...yes. I'm now in the middle of a murder enquiry. 
 I'm talking about progress into the Carter investigation. 
 Well, his business, his politics, his whereabouts are of no interest to me, nor is your involvement with him. 
 How dare you speak to me like that. 
 I don't like my time being wasted and my staff being manipulated especially when it's for your own personal ends. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 When you asked me to look into his presence here you first of all knew a heck of a lot more than you were telling me. 
 I often know more than I tell you. 
 And vice versa, Commissioner. 
 You said he'd booked at the Regency with his fiancee Lucinda Sheridan. 
 Which he had. 
 They didn't make a reservation till the following day, and though in fact Miss Sheridan and he are not yet married, the reservation was made in the names of Mr and Mrs Carter. 
 Miss Sheridan also already knew I was a policeman. 
 Would she have got that from you? 
 How would she get that from me? 
 She's your daughter. 
 Although according to her CV she paints under the name of Sheridan, her actual name is in fact Lucinda Rose. 
 And I would imagine her marriage to this man is something you wouldn't necessarily approve of. 
 That's entirely irrelevant. 
 Is it? 
 I won't ask how the photos of the shipyard came to be in his room. 
 What are you implying? 
 If he's in jail, he can't marry your daughter. 
 I asked you to investigate Raymond Carter for pre... 
 ..for precisely the reasons I told you. 
 The man's a genuine danger to the war effort. 
 It's quite wrong of you to think otherwise. 
 I admit there is a... a personal connection which perhaps I should have mentioned. 
 My daughter can be very wayward. 
 And I genuinely believe that this... this man will lead her further astray. 
 She seems very happy with him. 
 That's none of your business. 
 Precisely my feeling. 
 Which I think is where we came in. 
 My daughter no longer speaks to me, Foyle. 
 She changed her name because she didn't want to have anything to do with me. 
 But I still care about her. 
 Still worry about her. 
 You have a son? 
 Yes. 
 How would you feel if he wanted to marry a traitor? 
 Captain Hammond, sir, you shouldn't go. 
 You're absolutely right. 
 I shouldn't. 
 But thinking it through I can't come up with any alternative. 
 Go to the police. 
 I could of course. 
 But I don't fancy spending the rest of the war on the tread-mill at Reading Jail. 
 I don't suppose you're familiar with the work of Oscar Wilde? 
 What? 
 Never mind. It's... 
 If this works, you have nothing to worry about. 
 Even if it doesn't, you shouldn't have too much of a problem. 
 You can always say I ordered you. 
 Captain! 
 Forget it, Jack. 
 And remember, keep mum - at least for the next few hours. 
 2:30 it will all be over. 
 We shouldn't have done it, sir. 
 We should never have done it. 
 Yes. The joys of hindsight. 
 We should never have done it. 
 You're right. 
 But it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime moments. 
 I have no family. No wife. 
 It's not so bad for me. 
 But poor Ernest. And you. 
 [ KNOCK AT THE DOOR ] 
 Sir, the two men who supposedly worked in the storeroom at Talbot's John Richards and Tim Wilcox, now I know why nobody knew them. 
 Because they're dead? 
 They both died as children. 
 Right. 
 I think...we've got to pay another visit to Captain Hammond. 
 Where's Captain Hammond? 
 He's not here. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 I don't know where he is. 
 He left about an hour ago. 
 You're getting married soon, aren't you? 
 Yeah. Next week. 
 It would be nice if you were there. 
 There won't be a wedding if you don't do a little better than this. 
 We'll arrest you for withholding information. That's a prison term. 
 I haven't done anything. 
 Good. Where's Captain Hammond? 
 I've nothing to say to you, Mr Foyle. 
 Right. Well, I'm sorry. 
 Jack Archer, you're under arrest. 
 Come on. 
 Where's the money? 
 Where's the money? 
 What money? 
 The money you stole from the shipyard. 
 You see, the people whose money it is now want it back - understandably. 
 Jones has been killed because he wouldn't tell them where it was. 
 You and Hammond are next on the list. 
 Wouldn't it be sensible to tell us so we can get to them before they get to you? 
 Where's Captain Hammond? 
 Where's Captain Hammond? 
 Is he with the Talbots? 
 Sergeant. Mr Foyle, I can't believe this has happened. 
 Jack wouldn't get mixed up in something like this. 
 He doesn't think straight sometimes. 
 No lads do these days. 
 Are you sure you're not mistaken? 
 Yes, I am. I know this is a very difficult situation for you. 
 But would we have a better chance of getting anything out of him if your daughter had a word with him? 
 He may listen to her. I'm not sure she'd listen to me. I can ask. 
 Why don't I have a word with her? 
 Good idea. Off you go. 
 You've arrested him?! 
 Not me. Mr Foyle. 
 You promised me you wouldn't tell him what I said. 
 I didn't! 
 So why have they arrested him? 
 Gwen, Jack knows something. 
 We have to find out what it is. 
 Is he going to prison? 
 I don't know. 
 But it'll be worse for him if he doesn't help. 
 You think I can persuade him? 
 We think he'll listen to you. 
 Come on. 
 Right. I'll talk to him. 
 But after this is over I never want to see you again. 
 I thought you were my friend. 
 Gwen! 
 Gwen! Wait. 
 Gwen. 
 It doesn't matter, Dad. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 He's through here. 
 You shouldn't have come here. 
 I had to, Jack. 
 You've got to tell them want they want to know. 
 I can't. 
 They're gonna put you in prison. 
 Do you understand that? 
 Forget what Captain Hammond told you. 
 You've got to think of you and me. 
 Please, Jack. 
 All right. 
 There was part of this building. 
 A machine shop. It's condemned. 
 "Dangerous Structure!" "Keep Out!" 
 All that. 
 And it was in there. 
 What was? 
 Money. 
 More money than you'd believe. 
 Enough money to set us up for life. 
 It was easy. 
 We opened up the bomb, took the explosive out. stuffed the notes in, and carried it out under everyones' noses. 
 Where is the explosive now? 
 Hammond said you detonated it along the coast. Is that not the case? 
 We never detonated nothing. 
 He's got the bomb. 
 He's got the money. 
 He's gone to see the Talbots, hasn't he? 
 Where? 
 But where did the money come from, sir? 
 The Talbots have been claiming wages for about 400 people from The Ministry of Shipping. 
 They only have half that number working for them. What? 
 They've embezzled hundreds of pounds. 
 That's what Archer found in the warehouse. 
 What will they do with him, sir? 
 Put him in jail? 
 It'll depend on the circumstances. 
 Is that the money? 
 No. I thought I'd bring my dirty washing, you might like to clean it for me (!) 
 You shouldn't be funny with us. 
 Why not? The way the war's going we all need a sense of humour. 
 Show us? 
 All in good time. 
 I'm not a dishonest man. 
 At least I used not to be. 
 But I thought: Why not? 
 You've got to see this from my point of view. 
 My men and I, we've been cannon fodder. 
 Precious little training. 
 No support. 
 In the early days we even had to hitch lifts in civilian cars. 
 And how do we find out how the Germans make their bombs? 
 We wait till one of us gets blown up. 
 It tells us all we need to know. 
 I'll tell you something that may surprise you. 
 The man who invented the electric fuse was a Jerry called Ruehlmann. 
 He was in London just before the war. 
 He even went to an airshow and was shown plane factories. 
 He was probably sizing them up. 
 He was a guest of honour. 
 And we're mincemeat. 
 That's how it is. 
 So why not help ourselves? 
 The opportunity of a lifetime. 
 That's how I saw it. 
 My lifetime, that probably wasn't going to be all that long. 
 I think we've listened to you long enough, Captain Hammond. 
 Give us the money. 
 I thought we were meeting alone. 
 Which one of you killed Ernie Jones? 
 Then I'm very glad you're here. 
 You were lying to me. 
 You never were just going to take back the money, were you? 
 What would you have done, Captain Hammond? 
 That's what I thought. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 Aren't you going to count it? 
 This is very kind of you, sir. 
 Well, I thought so. 
 Oh. I've been meaning to ask you something, sir. 
 The money. 
 It wasn't blown up, was it? 
 No. Hammond had it in his quarters. 
 What did you do with it? 
 We sent it back. 
 To the government? 
 What would you have done with it? 
 I might have kept some. Gwen could have used it for her wedding. 
 Well, not ours to keep exactly. 
 And she's lucky she's still getting married. 
 I suppose so. 
 Do you know, I was crossed off the guest list. 
 Mr Foyle. What brings you here? 
 Not me, I hope. 
 No, no, no. 
 Malt whisky, getting harder and harder to find. 
 Forgive me interrupting. 
 I wanted to say goodbye. 
 No surprised you're off. 
 Wonderful news. 
 Isn't it? 
 What happened? 
 The Germans have invaded Russia. 
 Have they? 
 It was on the wireless this morning. 
 Churchill has promised to help Russia, so we're on the same side. 
 It's a turning point. They say Stalin has over seven million men. 
 Hitler's overreached himself. 
 The war can't last much longer. 
 We're going to London. 
 Good luck to you. 
 And to you. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Can it be possible? 
 The end of the war? 
 It would be nice to think so. 
 Well, I'm going to drink to it anyway. 
 Over by Christmas? 
 They said that last Christmas. 
 All right, then. New Year. 
 New Year.
