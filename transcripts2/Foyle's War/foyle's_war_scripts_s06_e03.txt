 What's your point, Major Kiefer? 
 Sir... 
 Just make sure we find the bodies. 
 We need to make a count. 
 The funerals... 
 There will be no funerals. 
 No next-of-kin. 
 Nothing ever happened here. 
 Colonel... 
 Ah. Here's one of them now. 
 [ SCREAMING ] 
 [ HORN BLARES ] 
 I'm afraid it's the same all over Hastings. 
 You could try the Royal, but I'm not sure they'll have anything. 
 Major John Kiefer. 
 I have a reservation. 
 Major Kiefer. Yes. 
 I suppose you're on your way home? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Glad to get back to your family? 
 Look - just give me the key, goddamnit, and let me go to my room. 
 I'm sorry. I'm tired. 
 Thank you. 
 What some bunting, love? 
 How much? 
 Two and six a quarter yard - and you don't need coupons. 
 That's outrageous. 
 You try and find any in the shops! 
 "Shift grease with Zixt hand soap!" 
 "Beecham's - the golden rule of health." 
 I hope you take my point, Miss Stewart. 
 Absolutely. 
 Short and pithy. 
 Six words, but they pin the product down in the public mind. 
 That's what we'll be looking for in a successful applicant. 
 I thought the position was for a secretary, Mr Ingleton. 
 Secretary to our chief copywriter. 
 You'd also be his apprentice. 
 We're looking for someone with imagination, someone willing to grasp the nettle. 
 Oh, that's me. 
 I'm willing to grasp it. 
 So! 
 Convince me. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Six words. A slogan I can't resist. 
 One that will persuade me to take you on. 
 Well, um... 
 Can't keep the client waiting, Miss Stewart. 
 Um... 
 Sam Stewart. 
 She gets the job done! 
 (SIGHS) Seven words. 
 Well, he's certainly an active little chap. Nothing wrong there. 
 Both of you are in good health. 
 The only question we have to ask is - is he going to wait for the end of the war? 
 How long do you think it will be? 
 The war or the baby? 
 I'm afraid I couldn't predict either. 
 But you've nothing to worry about, Mrs Milner. 
 Have you a bed at St Mary's? 
 Yes. That's where I worked. 
 Let them look after you for once. 
 Have you chosen a name? 
 We're going to call him Winston. 
 The fourth Winston this week. 
 Not surprising, I suppose. 
 Winston Milner. 
 We're still talking about it. 
 Aren't we? 
 How are you feeling? 
 Tired. I'm afraid this wasn't very well timed. 
 I couldn't be happier. 
 I bought two dozen nappies yesterday - one coupon each. 
 I don't know what we're going to do about his clothes. 
 Well, last time I saw Sam, she'd got her hands on an army blanket and was turning it into a romper suit. 
 That's a fine start in life. 
 An old blanket. 
 At least he'll be born in a world without war. 
 Oh! If he waits that long. 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Morning. 
 We've started moving stuff out. 
 I'd never have guessed. 
 I can't believe they want to close the old place down. 
 The new building on Wilder Road - it's a bit of an eyesore. 
 Nothing to do with me, Sergeant. 
 There's a Mr Griffiths waiting for you, sir. Local councillor. 
 I put him in your office. 
 I hope that's all right. Fine. 
 Morning, sir. 
 Morning. How is she? 
 Just seen the doctor, sir. 
 All's well. Good. 
 Have you heard yet, Mr Milner? 
 Not yet. 
 Promoted to DI and a dad! 
 Not bad for a week's work. 
 I haven't been promoted yet. 
 It's in the bag. 
 And when you get your pip, maybe you can put in a word for me. 
 No, not there. 
 It's the victory day celebrations. 
 Is it? What's the matter with them? 
 Well, large numbers of people out on the streets day and night. 
 The council has a responsibility, and there are certain issues we have to keep in mind. 
 What issues in particular? 
 As far as I'm concerned, none at all. 
 But as you'll see, I've been asked to chair a committee to look into all aspects of public order and safety. 
 We've taken a room at the museum. 
 It was the only space we could get. 
 Your name is at the top. 
 Well, ten o'clock tomorrow. 
 That's not a lot of notice. 
 We weren't given much notice ourselves, Mr Foyle. 
 But I'm sure we can deal with the matter expeditiously. 
 We do need to co-ordinate with the police. 
 Well, of course. 
 Thank you. 
 Bye. 
 Thank you, Mr Longmate. 
 Shall we go inside? 
 ..my wife's great-grandfather was the first proprietor of the hotel. 
 So are you expecting the next election soon, Mr Longmate? 
 Well, it can't happen soon enough for me. There are certainly plenty of Conservative MPs urging the premier to end coalition. 
 And you're confident of a Conservative victory? 
 Well, aren't you? I think even most Labour MPs expect it. 
 Is it true you're planning a victory celebration in the streets of Hastings? 
 That's right. 
 You're paying for it yourself? 
 Yes. 
 You don't think people might see that as an inducement to vote for you in the election? 
 You mean a bribe? 
 (TUTS) Well, I certainly hope not. 
 I think you underestimate the electorate, Mr Charman. 
 You ask any of my staff here at the hotel. 
 We deserve a party, and we're going to have one. 
 The fact that I'm paying for it is neither here nor there. 
 Thank you very much, sir. 
 Always glad to talk to the Chronicle. 
 Sir, we've had a notification of the committee meeting. 
 It's tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. 
 At the town hall? 
 They had to move it to the museum. 
 There's a shortage of space. 
 Nothing surprises me. 
 This whole town's turned on its head. 
 Would you like me to attend? 
 Ah, yes. 
 It would be good if you could take minutes, Miss Hylton. Anything else? 
 We're getting an awful lot of requests for rooms. 
 The telephone's been ringing nonstop. 
 Hastings, the seaside, the end of the war. 
 Where else would you want to be? 
 I've got something for you. 
 Oh, come in. 
 It didn't turn out quite as I hoped, but... 
 It was that army blanket. 
 For the baby! 
 Oh! Thank you, Sam. It's... 
 Edith will love it. 
 Any news on the move yet? 
 I still haven't got my promotion. 
 Well, they'd be mad not to promote you. 
 Oh, if you do go to Brighton, will you need a driver? 
 I don't think I'll get a car. 
 Darn. Oh, well, better show my face. 
 Yeah. 
 [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] 
 Yeah? 
 Just to tell you I'm back, sir. 
 Thank you. How did it go? 
 Not very well, I'm afraid, sir. 
 Oh? 
 I really don't know what I'll do after the war. 
 I am glad Adolf's finally copped it and all that, but a part of me can't help wishing it would go on another year. 
 Well, I'm glad we don't all think like that. 
 No. It's a stupid thing to say, I suppose. 
 I don't know. 
 This place is closing down, you're retiring, Milner's transferring to Brighton. 
 We've been together so long, I feel I'm losing my family. 
 I don't know what I'm going to do. 
 I've tried advertising, accountancy, three other offices, but nobody seems to want me. 
 I'll probably go back to Leominster, live with my parents and become a governess or something. 
 Something here might interest you. 
 Is it a job? 
 Well, sort of. 
 Organisation called SSAFA. 
 Mean anything? 
 No, sir. What is it? 
 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association. 
 Um, they help returning servicemen. 
 Help them how? 
 I'm not altogether sure, but they need volunteers, and it could be right up your street. 
 All right, sir. I'll breeze along. 
 Don't you want to reconsider? 
 Reconsider what? 
 Retiring. 
 Um...no, thank you. 
 Did you get the bread? 
 Where did this come from? 
 What? 
 It was on the front door. 
 A tiger? 
 Yes. Who put it there? 
 I - I didn't see it. 
 It wasn't there this morning. 
 What is the matter with you, Mark? 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 It must be something. 
 It's obviously upset you. 
 It's nothing. 
 Perhaps you ought to take something. 
 You're miles away. 
 I didn't get the bread. 
 All the bakers are sold out. 
 Right. Well, we won't have bread with our tea, then. 
 It doesn't matter. I'll be in late. 
 You're always late. 
 Are you going to the pub? Mother. 
 You haven't been the same since you came back. 
 I wish you'd tell me what happened. 
 You haven't been the same. 
 Radio : 'I'm I'm in the village of Luneberg, and I'm watching the German army coming into surrender.' 
 'German tanks, guns a multitude of lorries and infantrymen in their hundreds have been arriving, bringing with them beaten men.' 
 'In the midst of these defeated soldiers comes a huddle of RAF release prisoners, cheering as they go by.' 
 'It's what we've been waiting for - the end of the German army in the north.' 
 I don't understand it, sir. 
 Hitler's dead, Goering's gone mad - they say he's wearing a toga - and the rest of them are having their faces changed. 
 Why won't they announce it's all over? 
 Beats me. 
 Station, sir? 
 No. The museum. 
 Taking a day off? 
 Wouldn't that be nice? 
 Oh, I spoke to the people at SSAFA. 
 I'm seeing them this afternoon. 
 Well, that's good. 
 Do you want me to wait for you, sir? 
 What a good idea. 
 Ziegler. That's a German name. 
 I was actually born in Austria. 
 Yes. Well, it's all the same now. 
 Forgive me, but I don't see what business my nationality is of yours. 
 You don't come in here without my say-so. Obviously. 
 If you want to disrupt this committee because of my name... 
 Is there a problem? 
 No sir. Just checking the register. 
 Who are you? 
 Brown, sir. 
 Michael Brown. Assistant curator. 
 I've been asked to keep an eye on you gentlemen while you're here. 
 I'm Henry Ziegler. Dr Ziegler. 
 How do you do? Christopher Foyle. 
 This gentleman seems to have some problem with my parentage. 
 Not at all, sir. 
 I'm just doing my job. 
 All right for us to go in now, do you think? 
 Oh, certainly, sir. 
 I'll tick you off. Up the stairs. 
 Odd place for a Victory Day committee. Yeah, isn't it? 
 Oh, I think we must be through here. 
 ..fortunately, we still have supplies. 
 I just hope we're not going to be accused of hoarding. 
 Ah, Mr Foyle. And Dr Ziegler. 
 May I introduce Martin Longmate, who owns the Majestic Hotel. 
 Longmate. We've met, I think. 
 No. I don't think so. 
 Martin Longmate. 
 I feel sure I know the name. 
 You may have read about me. 
 Ah, yes? In the press. 
 I'm standing for parliament. 
 Perhaps. 
 And Miss Hylton has kindly agreed to take the minutes. 
 How do you do? 
 So are we all here? 
 One more still to come. 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 Christopher! 
 John. 
 What are you doing? 
 What are YOU doing? 
 I'm on the committee. 
 Well, me too. 
 I suppose now I come to think of it, you're the first person they'd ask. 
 How are you? 
 Much the same. 
 But you were transferred. 
 That's right. But I'm back. 
 I'm Major John Kiefer, with the 215th US Engineers. 
 We built the air base at Hawthorn Hill. 
 That monstrosity! 
 So you don't like it, huh? 
 Well, it helped us launch the invasion in Europe and win the war. 
 You know, I'm really sorry if it spoiled the landscape. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... 
 No, no, no I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 It just took a lot of the... blood, sweat, toil and tears your Mr Churchill goes on about. 
 Are you waiting for someone? 
 DCS Foyle. 
 Ah. 
 Do you work here? 
 Yeah. I'm assistant curator. 
 Yeah, I was in the Home Guard until they stood us down. 
 Now I'm back here. 
 Do you know how long they're going to be? 
 I couldn't believe it - they've got a Jerry up there! 
 Did you see that? 
 No, I can't say I did. 
 I mean, you read what that lot have been doing, Belsen and all that stuff, and it makes you sick. 
 They're not human. 
 Well, forgive and forget, I suppose. 
 Not a bit of it. We ought to kill the whole lot of them. 
 Wipe them off the face of the earth. 
 Nice talking to you. 
 Shall we start at the beginning? 
 Public order offences. 
 Like what, Mr Griffiths? 
 The destruction of public property, for a start. 
 Are you aware that several park benches have already disappeared, dismantled, we believe, to make bonfires? 
 Boy, that's the British. You come out of a war and start worrying about a few park benches. 
 Major Kiefer, I should remind you there are many hundreds of GIs here in Hastings, not known for their orderly conduct when it comes to street parties. 
 I guess you've got it in for the Yanks, haven't you? 
 I didn't say that. 
 Maybe I should remind you, Mr Griffiths, the end of the war was announced on US bases a week ago, and, ah, we didn't have any problems. 
 A week ago? 
 Actually, it was an error. 
 But uh, we didn't lose our heads. 
 No dead bodies. 
 Look, there will be offences - drunkenness, destroying public property. 
 But uh, surely to goodness, after five years, people deserve to let their hair down. 
 And you're organising a party, is that right? 
 It's to be the largest in the south of England. 
 Mr Longmate's paying for it himself. 
 I'm just doing my bit, as I wasn't able to fight. 
 You weren't fit for active service? 
 A problem with my eyes. 
 Your eyes? 
 That's right. 
 Anything else? 
 Besides park benches? 
 Right now, we need all the help we can get. 
 Our main role is a practical one. 
 Information, to begin with. 
 You worked with the police? 
 Yes. 
 Well, a bit of detective work may be called for. 
 We have thousands of soldiers searching for friends and families. 
 People have moved. 
 Many have been bombed out. 
 And then there are wounded or missing servicemen with families searching for them. 
 How can I help? 
 Well, we have people coming in every day, and every single one of them has a different need. 
 It may just be a question of clothing. 
 Don't they get demob suits? 
 That's hardly adequate. 
 No, we have a central clothing branch in London that sends out almost a million pieces of clothing a year. 
 Then there's food, housing or just a friendly face, someone they can talk to. 
 Well, that's me. 
 Miss Stewart, I think I should warn you, some of these men are more damaged than any of us really understands. 
 Fighting in a war, being taken prisoner, being injured - just being away, in some cases for years - it takes its toll. 
 I'm sure. 
 So you think you can cope? 
 I'll give it my best shot. 
 Not quite the right expression in the circumstances, but let's see how you go. 
 Bodies. 
 Thank you, Major Kiefer. 
 Hundreds of them! 
 It was nobody's fault, Major. 
 That's not true. 
 You know it's not true. 
 Who cares about truth? 
 We win the war. That's all that matters. Just get back home. 
 (ECHOING) Just get back home... 
 Just get back home... 
 Ahh! 
 (FIGHTS FOR BREATH) 
 Ah... 
 [ BIRDSONG ] 
 [ MUSIC ON RADIO ] 
 Eddie! 
 Be careful with that! That's a hundred quid's worth of best china. 
 Best china? All we've got in the canteen is a few cracked mugs. 
 Evidence, Miss Stewart. Nicked from a warehouse in Eastbourne. 
 The case comes up next month. 
 Morning, sir. 
 Sergeant. 
 There's something in the paper you ought to see. 
 Don't tell me. 
 They finally announced it's over? 
 No such luck. 
 No, it's on the employment page. 
 I thought it might suit you. 
 Prospective conservative candidate seeks personal assistant. 
 I don't know, Brookie. 
 I don't know a thing about politics. 
 You don't know about advertising either, but that didn't stop you. 
 That's true. 
 It's a local number. 
 Why not give it a ring? 
 Yeah, I could do worse. 
 Then if he does get in, you could be in Parliament. 
 Maybe I'll meet Winnie! 
 Yeah. Morning, Mr Milner. 
 Morning. 
 [ CLATTERING ] 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Sorry, sir. 
 Sir? 
 Sergeant. 
 How was the committee? 
 Well, a complete waste of time. 
 A lot of talk about nothing in particular, no action at the end of it - as expected, really. 
 At least it's over. No, they want us back tomorrow. Hello? 
 Hotel reception, please. 
 A Saturday? 
 We have to be prepared for every eventuality, it seems. 
 VE Day. That's what they're calling it. Victory in Europe. 
 Hello? I understand you have a Major Kiefer is staying with you. 
 Is that right? 
 Why didn't you tell me you were coming home? All right, ain't it? 
 Stop and ask someone if I could use the blower. 
 You could have written. 
 I only got out at the last minute. 
 There was a spare seat on a Dakota and the CO said I could have it, cos I'd been out there the longest. 
 So where were you? 
 I don't even know where you've been. 
 It was an island. 
 A place called Ist. 
 Ist? 
 That's a funny name. 
 Yeah. 
 We'll have to find it on the map. 
 It would have been easier knowing where you were. 
 That was the worst of it. 
 Well, we moved around a bit. 
 Here...give me a hug. 
 You feel different. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I don't know. You've put on weight. 
 That's not a nice thing to say! 
 No. It suits you. It's funny though. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 You're different too, Eddie. 
 How? 
 I haven't seen you for four years. 
 You've been away for four years. 
 It's like I'm meeting you for the first time. 
 Yeah...well, we've got a lot of catching up to do. 
 Not now! I've got to get to work. 
 You're not serious. 
 Well, I'm not going to work. 
 Of course I'm not. 
 But I've got to let Mr Longmate know. 
 I'll have to call in. 
 Who's Mr Longmate? 
 My boss. I wrote to you. 
 The Majestic Hotel. 
 He gave me a job. 
 Is that all he gave you? 
 Don't say things like that! 
 Why don't you come along with me? 
 Yeah. Maybe I will. 
 We'll go along together. 
 You can meet Mr Longmate. 
 Maybe he can help you. 
 Why should I need any help? 
 You need a job. 
 A job? Work? 
 The war's over, Eddie. 
 We need to start again. 
 Yeah. 
 You made it. 
 That's all that matters. 
 And we're together. 
 I can't bear it. 
 Your blood pressure is very high. 
 When did you last get a proper night's sleep? 
 I can't sleep. 
 Maybe it's the silence. 
 You'd be surprised how many people find it impossible to sleep without bombs dropping, and sirens. 
 I need something. 
 What you need is to rest. 
 Rest. 
 What is it you've got on your mind? 
 I'm being persecuted. 
 Persecuted? 
 Because of what happened. 
 It was terrible. Horrible. 
 But it wasn't just me. 
 Please, old chap. 
 Try to calm down. 
 You're not making sense. 
 Why are they blaming me? 
 Nobody's blaming you for anything. 
 You've worked yourself up into a state. 
 I can't even go out of the house. 
 Look, I'm going to give you a prescription. 
 Something to calm you down and help you to sleep. 
 And I think you should give our next committee meeting a miss. 
 You're in no state for anything. 
 It wasn't my fault! 
 I don't deserve this! 
 I'm very, very pleased to meet you, Edward. 
 You didn't tell me he was coming home. 
 I didn't know. 
 Can I get you anything? 
 A drink? Something to eat? 
 I'm all right, thank you, sir. 
 Do sit down. 
 Well, I imagine you've been around the houses, then. 
 Tunisia, Greece, Albania, Libya and Italy. That's right, sir. 
 Quite a war. 
 You could say that. 
 You're glad it's over? 
 I can imagine you'll find it hard to adapt - 
 Civvy Street and all that. 
 I just need time to myself, sir. 
 With my wife. 
 Of course. Janice, you must take as much time as you need. 
 I hate to let you down, Mr Longmate. 
 Don't even think of it. 
 And Edward, when you've had a chance to settle in a bit, you must come and see me. 
 You were a joiner before the war? 
 A general carpenter, sir. 
 We've plenty of work. 
 We'll have a place for you. 
 What about the committee, Mr Longmate? 
 Susan can come with me. Don't worry. 
 The luggage is in? 
 All in, sir. 
 [ LID BANGS ] 
 It's nothing, Eddie. Come on! 
 I have an appointment with Mr Longmate. It's Miss Stewart. 
 I'll let him know you're here. 
 Well, here we are again. 
 Just like old times. 
 Is it? 
 You tell me. 
 Here. I brought you something. 
 That's very kind of you. 
 I figured supplies might be low. 
 You're right. 
 You can open it. 
 Oh, it's a bit early for me. 
 Not for me. 
 Sit down. 
 Water? 
 No, thanks. 
 How's your boy? 
 I wish I knew. 
 He's in Malta. 
 Haven't heard for quite a while. 
 So why do you want to see me? 
 I said I'd like to see you if you had time. Not quite the same thing. 
 So this isn't official? 
 No. 
 Bottoms up. 
 Another? 
 No, thank you, Christopher. 
 I don't need another. 
 You asked me to come over here. 
 I want to know why. 
 Well, look, it just occurred to me that after the surprise of meeting the other day, you've been in Hastings, haven't been in touch - I wondered if everything was all right. 
 I'm fine. Glad to be back. 
 You've been in Devon. Is that right? 
 Yeah. 
 And it rained even more than it does here. 
 Do any fishing? 
 Never got the chance. 
 Well, listen, I'm going out tomorrow. 
 Interested? 
 I thought we were all meeting again tomorrow. 
 The goddamn committee. 
 The goddamn committee is in the afternoon. 
 We've got the morning. 
 No thanks, Christopher. I'll pass. 
 I kind of lost the taste for fishing over the years. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 I lost the taste for a lot of things. 
 You know what? 
 I just want to go home. 
 That's about the size of it. 
 Well, here we are. 
 Please take a seat. 
 Um, tell me about your war, Miss Stewart. 
 Well, there's not much to tell, really. 
 I started out in the MTC. 
 Motorised Transport Corps. 
 And then I was transferred to the police. 
 A detective? 
 No such luck. 
 A driver. And that's what I've been doing ever since. 
 And are you interested in politics? 
 Absolutely. 
 So what are your views on, for example, Beveridge and his ideas for a National Health Service? 
 Oh - I'm all for it. 
 But we also want to reduce taxation. 
 Can't you do both? 
 It may not be possible. 
 Ah. That is a bit tricky, isn't it? 
 Have you thought about Labour plans for public ownership? 
 Constantly. 
 Look. I don't really know much about politics, Mr Longmate. 
 In fact I don't really know anything. 
 But it seems to me we trusted Mr Churchill to get us through the war, and we ought to trust him with the peace. 
 Well, that's very honest of you, Miss Stewart, and honesty in politics can be a very rare commodity. 
 I wonder if you'd have lunch with me tomorrow? 
 Oh! Well, I'm not sure I'm - 
 I'm sorry. That's forward of me. 
 Please don't take it the wrong way. 
 You see, a large part of the work being my personal assistant will involve one-to-one contact with me and with my constituents. 
 We need to know that we can get along. 
 So all I'm proposing is something a little less formal than this interview. 
 I'm afraid I'm not free for lunch. 
 I'm working with SSAFA. 
 That's very commendable. Does you credit. How about dinner? 
 Tomorrow? 
 The hotel has a very good cook. 
 I suppose so. All right. 
 Well, I'll see you here at seven o'clock, and we can talk some more. 
 You're not eating anything. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 You must be hungry. 
 That's the best tinned salmon. 
 I don't know the last time I opened a tin. I never have enough points. 
 Where did you get it? 
 The hotel. 
 Longmate? 
 What's wrong with you, Eddie? 
 Yes, he gave it to me for you. 
 He's looked after me. 
 What's that meant to mean? 
 He's given me a job! 
 I had to do something while you were away. 
 Is this how it's going to be? 
 You've come back, but it's like I hardly know you. 
 I need to see someone. 
 Who? 
 The quack. I've got gut-rot. 
 I need to see someone. 
 I'll make you an appointment. 
 It's all right. I've done it. 
 Dr Ziegler. 
 Ziegler? 
 I'm seeing him tomorrow. 
 You should let me look after you. 
 You can. 
 I'll tell you where you can start. 
 What is it you're not telling me? 
 Where've you been? 
 The pub. I felt like a drink. 
 You could have had a drink here. 
 There's nothing in the pantry. 
 Have you eaten? 
 No. 
 Would you like something? 
 It's all right, Mother. 
 You've got to eat. 
 What's this? I don't know. 
 It's addressed to you. 
 Who delivered it? 
 I didn't see. 
 Someone knocked on the door. 
 I went outside and it was there on the step. 
 You didn't see them? 
 I just told you. 
 Are you going to open it? 
 No.

 Dad? 
 I thought I'd find you here.

 Here you are. 
 Cheers, Dad. 
 Hm! A full bottle of scotch. 
 Where on earth did you get that? 
 Well, it's bourbon. 
 Ah, Americans. 
 Yeah, a friend of mine. Well, he was. 
 So is this just a visit, or are you back for good? 
 I'm not flying any more. 
 I had a touch of sinusitis a couple of months ago. 
 More than a touch. 
 Four days in hospital. 
 Cured? 
 Don't ask. It was bloody painful. 
 Then the Group Captain sent me home. 
 So you're out of it? 
 Yes. I made it. 
 I can't stop thinking about all the ones who didn't. 
 Rex Talbot. Charlie Paige. 
 So many of them. 
 They were my friends, and yet it's like I hardly knew them. 
 Here one day, gone the next. 
 The best of the best. 
 Why them, not you? 
 That's what I wonder all the time. 
 Perhaps you were the better pilot. 
 You know, what they say is exactly the opposite. 
 The real fliers, the ones who knew what they were doing, they were the easiest to bring down. 
 It was the lazy bastards, the ones who cut corners, who didn't do it by the book - we got away with it because Jerry didn't know what to expect. 
 You're definitely leaving the police? 
 Can't wait. 
 How's Sam? 
 Why do you ask? 
 Just wondering. 
 You met somebody else, didn't you? 
 Yeah. 
 It didn't work out. 
 Debden was bloody awful, if you want the truth, Dad. 
 It drizzled the whole time and the only decent pubs were in Cambridge. 
 I didn't like the training. 
 I missed my Spit. 
 Kate was a nice girl. 
 In the WAAF. 
 I sort of persuaded myself I was in love with her, but I wasn't. 
 Well, Sam's all right. 
 I mean, she's still the driver, and she's got some voluntary work with SSAFA. 
 I'd like to see her. 
 Maybe I'll look her up. 
 You weren't very kind to her. 
 I know. 
 Stupid bloody war. 
 Do you think it was worth it, Dad? 
 Well, we've all paid a price, some more than others, but I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever. 
 Yes. 
 And I'm very glad you're back. 
 [ PHONE RINGS ] 
 Hello? 
 'It was just a few numbers.' 
 Who is this? What do you want? 
 More than 700 American boys died because of you. 
 That's not true. 
 I wasn't responsible. 
 You're mistaken. Now leave me alone! 
 You look like you could do with a cup. 
 The sugar's had it, I'm afraid. 
 I don't take sugar. 
 That's all right, then. 
 I'm Sam Stewart. 
 Hylton. Edward. Ed. 
 Just back? 
 Yeah. 
 Where were you? 
 All around. 
 Army? 
 Y Patrol. 
 Long range desert group, signals operator. 
 You must be glad to be out. 
 No. No, I'm not sure I am. 
 I don't know why people aren't more cheerful. 
 The war's over, but everyone seems the same. 
 Maybe it hasn't sunk in yet. 
 I was told you could help with work and that sort of thing. 
 We can try. 
 So what can you do for me, Miss Stewart? 
 Well, we have a booklet. 
 It tells you what kind of things we have on offer - university grants, training, employment schemes and so on. 
 Are you all right for money? 
 I've got money. They gave me eight weeks' paid leave. 
 And you have somewhere to live? 
 I have a house, but I'm thinking of moving. 
 I don't want to stay in Hastings. 
 Maybe you should try the Resettlement Advice Office. 
 There's one in Welham Road. 
 Welham Road. 
 And did you know we have a married families club? 
 Are you married? 
 You might like to join. 
 I'm sorry. 
 If you want the honest truth, this is my first day here and I'm not much cop at it. 
 I'm all right at making a cup of tea, but that's about it. 
 Do you want me to find someone else? 
 No. I've got nothing to say. 
 Is it really so bad, being back? 
 I don't know where I am any more. 
 I don't know what to believe. 
 Four years out there, behind the lines, doing what we did, all of us together. 
 And they suddenly tell us it's all over, and we've got to come back and start again. 
 How are we meant to do that? 
 How are we meant to put it all behind us? 
 A cup of tea, married families club... 
 Half my mates got killed out there. 
 Maybe they were the lucky ones. 
 I don't understand why they keep hanging on. 
 It's bad for people, waiting all the time for an announcement. 
 I'm getting a lot of patients with nervous conditions, depressed, unable to sleep. 
 I heard a rumour it'll be tomorrow. 
 I heard that rumour about today. 
 I have received confirmation that when the victory is announced, public houses are to remain open until midnight. 
 Now where is it? 
 Licensing hours, Hastings and Eastbourne. 
 Is that what you're looking for? 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 As Dr Ziegler said, I haven't slept myself. 
 That's too bad. 
 Are you well enough to go on? 
 Yes, yes. 
 That's why we're all here. 
 More whisky and gin has been distributed across the south coast, in bottles marked NOT TO BE SOLD UNTIL VICTORY NIGHT. 
 We need to be sure that's strictly adhered to, Mr Foyle. 
 I don't quite see how we're supposed to do that, exactly. 
 We can send officers into as many pubs as you like, but the chances of them coming out again are pretty slim, I'd have said. 
 So what did he say? 
 Dr Ziegler wasn't there, but the nurse saw me. 
 There's nothing to worry about. 
 The baby's being slow, that's all. 
 Janice! 
 I'm sorry? 
 It's Edith! You must remember. 
 We met at Dr Ziegler's. 
 No. You're wrong. I don't know you. 
 But you were... 
 I'm sorry. I must have mistaken you for somebody else. 
 Who was she? 
 I don't know. I never met her. 
 She knew your name. 
 I didn't know hers. 
 You look tired, Edward. 
 I've got a few errands to run. 
 Why don't you go home on your own? 
 Right. I don't think there are any other matters outstanding. 
 Well, if that's so, would you mind very much if I took myself off? 
 I still have a party to organise. 
 How many people are you inviting? 
 The whole town's invited, Dr Ziegler that includes you. 
 Ah, thank you. But I think I shall be staying peacefully at home. 
 There'll be enough whisky and gin for everyone, that I can promise. 
 Not to be sold until victory night. 
 Exactly. 
 We wouldn't want to be sending out the wrong signals. 
 Miss Gilbert will take the minutes, and I'll say good day. 
 I should be going as well. 
 Ah, Mr Foyle, there was one thing I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Yeah? 
 Um, it's a private matter. I wonder if I might call in at the station? 
 Are you there this afternoon? 
 I am. Any time you like. 
 Thank you. 
 You going my way? 
 No, I need some shuteye. 
 I'm heading back to the hotel. 
 Ah, right. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 It's Saturday. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I thought you might like to get out, sir. 
 The sooner the better. 
 Good day, Mr Griffith. 
 What are you doing with that? 
 What do you think? Burning it! 
 Good lads. 
 Bunting! Union Jacks! 
 Red, white and blue! 
 No street party's complete - buy your colours. 
 A couple of flags, please. 
 Five bob each, mate. 
 Five bob? You're pulling my leg. 
 You want one, that's what you pay. 
 (SIGHS) 
 All right. I'll have this one. 
 That one's two quid. 
 What? 
 This one's five bob. 
 You're not serious! 
 Do I look like I'm joking? 
 You don't like it, go elsewhere. 
 People died for this flag. 
 Don't that mean something? 
 I'm trying to do business. No, what you're doing is profiteering. 
 You hadn't noticed there's a law against that? 
 Says who? The war's over, mate. 
 Or haven't they told you? 
 The law's still the law. 
 What are you going to do? Arrest me? 
 Yeah. That's what I'm going to do. 
 My name is Sergeant Brooke, Sussex constabulary. 
 And you are coming with me. 
 Oh, bloody hell. 
 Stop that man! 
 Stop! Stop that man! 
 Stop! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 STOP! 
 Hey! Stop! Stop that man! 
 [ DOGS BARK ] 
 Stop! 
 Aargh! 
 (GROANS) 
 Miss Stewart. 
 How very good of you to come. 
 Thank you for inviting me. 
 Shall we go in? 
 Mm. 
 May I ask you something, Mr Longmate? 
 Do you invite everyone who's applied for this job to dinner? 
 Absolutely not. Shall we say you're um...through to the second round. 
 Two advantages to owning an hotel. 
 Deep cellars, and... 
 I get to choose who drinks what. 
 How did you come to own an hotel? 
 I'd like to say that I started from the bottom and worked my way up, but I'm afraid that's not true. 
 I inherited the hotel when my wife died. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It was at the very start of the war. 
 She was...visiting a friend in London and er... 
 ..took a direct hit. 
 Well, there have been so many casualties, so much suffering, and that's why this election will be so important. 
 We've got to rebuild. 
 It's a chance to start again. 
 You never told me what you expect your assistant to do. 
 To stay close to me. 
 To be someone I can trust. 
 That's not quite what it said in the advertisement. 
 Well, I was paying by the word. 
 So you were in the MTC? 
 For a year. 
 And then the police. 
 That's rather unusual. 
 Who exactly did you drive? 
 A detective. Here in Hastings. 
 His name is Mr Foyle. 
 Christopher Foyle? 
 Yes. 
 Have you met him? 
 Yes, I was with him this afternoon. 
 Martin. 
 Miss Hylton! 
 I've been looking for you. 
 I'm afraid this is a private dinner. 
 I really can't talk now. 
 A private dinner? 
 I know what you're doing. 
 I know exactly what you're doing! 
 Janice, remember, this is a public place. you can't behave like this. 
 I need to speak to you. 
 Not now! Now! 
 [ SILENCE FALLS ] 
 Miss Stewart, I'm afraid you're going to have to forgive me. 
 This is my current secretary, who is a little distraught, but er...to be honest, if I may, I don't think you'd be right for the post. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 (SIGHS DEEPLY) 
 I've got to work. 
 You're not serious. 
 Well, it's not exactly how I'd choose to spend my Sunday. 
 Who's been murdered this time? 
 A man called Ziegler. Dr Ziegler. 
 German? 
 Austrian. 
 But as English as you and me. 
 So who killed him? 
 Well, don't ask me, I've no idea. 
 What are you gonna do while I'm gone? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 Not much, I don't think. 
 Poor Dad! 
 It could only happen to you! 
 What do you mean? 
 The whole country preparing for a giant knees-up, and you're stuck with the body in the library. 
 It was in the museum. 
 That's it, just to the left a bit. 
 Perfect. 
 Well, that's er...very colourful. 
 They were an absolute steal, sir. 
 They're just getting ready for the big announcement. 
 Are you all right, by the way? 
 Dr Ziegler. 
 Yeah, he ran right into me, sir. 
 Well, I ran into him. 
 Speak to you? 
 Not a word, I'm afraid, sir. 
 It was just my luck, really. 
 If he'd said who stuck the knife in, we could have all gone home. 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Sorry to drag you in on a Sunday. 
 I knew Dr Ziegler. 
 Did you? 
 So did I. 
 How did you know him? 
 He'd been treating Edith. 
 He was unmarried, no family that we know of. 
 He'd been living in London, came down to Hastings last year. 
 What else do we know about him? 
 Well, we know that the er... last conversation I had with him was about him wanting to see me about something. 
 Do you think that's why he was killed? 
 Could be. 
 You don't think it was his name, do you, sir? Ziegler. 
 There's so much anti-German feeling, what with these pictures of Belsen, and the rest of it. 
 He didn't look or sound German. 
 What do we know about the knife? 
 The killer took it with him. 
 But the pathologist looked at the wound and said we're looking for something with a long, curved blade. 
 (KNOCK) 
 Yeah. 
 Is it true someone's been murdered? 
 Perhaps. 
 I'll get the car. 
 I don't know. Really! 
 Dragging me back here on a Sunday! 
 Yeah, it's so inconsiderate getting murdered on a weekend, isn't it? 
 Yes, yes, all right. 
 You didn't much care for Dr Ziegler, I seem to remember. 
 I didn't have anything against him. 
 Not what I heard. 
 Oh? 
 Germans - kill the lot of them, wipe them from the face of the earth. 
 Do you remember saying that? 
 You're not trying to say I put a knife in him, are you? 
 It looks as if there's a knife missing here, wouldn't you say? 
 I don't know anything about that. 
 And wouldn't this normally be locked? 
 Well, people are bringing stuff in and out. 
 Someone must have forgotten to lock it. 
 You were downstairs when the meeting broke up yesterday, weren't you? 
 Well, I was er...I was at the door. 
 Hm. Do you remember, by any chance, which of us came out first? 
 Well, I can't be certain because I wasn't there the whole time. 
 Um... The Yank. Major Kiefer. 
 Yes, he was the first one out. 
 Yes, I can tell you that for sure. 
 And you'd remember that because...? 
 Well, I saw him and I heard him. 
 And then I went along the corridor... call of nature, if you must know ..and then the next person I saw was er... Mr Griffiths. And there was a woman, as well. 
 Came out around the same time as me. 
 You remember her? 
 No, I didn't see her. 
 Were any of them carrying anything suspicious when they left? 
 You mean like a great big fishing knife? No, I didn't see. 
 He was killed on his way home with a knife taken from the museum. 
 It seems probable that it was someone in the meeting. 
 So that's Kiefer, Longmate, Longmate's secretary... 
 And Griffiths. 
 From Ziegler's appointment book, he saw him on Friday. 
 The notes mentioned blood pressure and stress. 
 He was prescribed sleeping pills. 
 Really? 
 What happened? 
 It's a suicide. He took pills. 
 Mr Griffiths? 
 Yes. 
 Who authorised the removal of the body? 
 I've no idea, guv. 
 But it's all cut and dried. 
 He left a note, apparently. 
 And, quite frankly, I've got a party to get to. 
 No-one's hanging around here. 
 And this is definitely your son's handwriting? 
 Yes, it is. 
 And this was on the kitchen table when you came down this morning? 
 I've already told you. 
 "It wasn't me. I wasn't responsible. I'm sorry, I can't live with this." 
 It's obviously a... very great shock for you. 
 (SIGHS) The war's over. 
 He came through it. 
 And then he has to do this. 
 What's the point? 
 Wasn't responsible for what? 
 What do you think he meant by that? 
 I don't know. 
 He hadn't been the same since he came back. 
 He wasn't eating. He was spending time down at the pub, he hardly said a word. 
 Since he came back from where? 
 Er... The West Country. 
 He was with the Royal Signal Corps. 
 He didn't tell me any more than that. 
 The name Ziegler mean anything to you? 
 That was Mark's doctor. 
 The one who gave him the sleeping pills. 
 The ones he took. 
 Well, once again, we're um... very sorry. 
 It doesn't make any difference. 
 This bloody war - it's taken everything anyway. 
 It's taken everything we ever cared about. 
 And people have become most strange. 
 Somebody sent him some sand. 
 Some sand? 
 An envelope full of sand. 
 When was that? 
 A few days ago. Friday. 
 Anything else? 
 He said he was being followed. 
 He thought someone was... watching him. 
 I thought he was just imagining things. 
 I told you, he hadn't been the same. 
 But there was a picture also pinned to the door. 
 A picture? A picture of what? 
 It was cut out of a magazine. 
 It was an animal. A tiger. 
 Well, why would someone do that? 
 A tiger? 
 What's it meant to mean? 
 So, did you see the doctor? 
 I turned up for the appointment. 
 He weren't there. 
 So, how are you feeling? 
 Are you feeling better? 
 Why don't you tell me about her? 
 Who? 
 That woman we met. In the street. 
 I...I told you. I've never seen her before in my life. 
 That's not what she thought. 
 Well, she was wrong. 
 Look, I'm fed up of this. 
 I've had enough of it! 
 You're lying to me, Janice. 
 I know you are! 
 I never met her before! 
 You're lying! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You can get £12's worth of civilian clothing. 
 Don't forget your demob suit. 
 If you need any more information, come back any time. 
 Thank you, Miss. 
 I already have my £12. 
 And my demob suit. 
 Not that I think I'll be wearing it. 
 But I was told you also gave advice. 
 When did you get back? 
 Yesterday. 
 From Debden? 
 No, I've been flying again. 
 I was in Malta. 
 How are you? 
 Well, I...I need someone to talk to. 
 Well, we've plenty of leaflets. 
 Yes. Yes, I can see. 
 But I don't think I'd find the answer to my problem there. 
 What is your problem? 
 Well, er... 
 ..it's like this, you see. 
 I was in Hastings for a while. 
 My squadron was only a couple of miles away. 
 And while I was there, I... sort of fell in love. 
 Well, no sort of about it. 
 I met this girl and the two of us walked out for a time. 
 Andrew, please. And then I got sent to this training centre. 
 And I was promoted to Squadron Leader. 
 But I hated it there. 
 And the fact is, I must have been a little bit out of my mind, because I behaved like a complete cad. 
 I broke it off with this girl. 
 I didn't even have the nerve to tell her face to face. 
 I wrote her a letter and told her I'd met someone else, even though I knew the someone else wasn't a patch on her, and of course it didn't last very long. 
 And there hasn't been a day when I haven't regretted what I did... 
 ..and wished I could somehow undo it and take back the hurt I know I must have caused. 
 And that's why I'm asking your advice, you see, because... 
 ..because I'm still looking for a way. 
 I'm not sure there is a way, Andrew. 
 But if I saw her and... 
 ..told her what a fool I was, and begged her to consider? 
 I don't think she's the sort of girl who would like begging. 
 Do you think she'd at least consider? 
 Consider what? 
 Well, just seeing me. 
 Spending time together, just being friends. 
 Well, she'd have to look in the leaflets, see what they advise. 
 (SCOFFS) You don't have a leaflet about love. 
 No, but I've quite a few on desertion. 
 Yes, well... 
 Well, thank you anyway. 
 You know, Sam, in all this time you've hardly changed at all. 
 Really? 
 But I have. 
 Sir, you know the man you're going to see? Martin Longmate. 
 He owns the hotel, doesn't he? 
 He does. 
 Well, I think you ought to know, I applied to be his personal assistant. 
 Did you? Did you get it? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, maybe best not to accept it anyway, not just yet. Thank you. 
 Well, well, well! 
 Come to say goodbye? 
 You're leaving? 
 That's right. I got my 85 points. 
 That earns me a ticket on the good ship Aquitania heading for New York. 
 I'm not sure that's going to be possible. 
 Why's that? 
 You probably know about Ziegler. 
 Sure. But you're not gonna tell me I had anything to do with that, right? 
 I mean, I hardly knew the man. 
 You may not know about Griffiths. 
 What about him? 
 He's dead. 
 Dead? 
 Sit down. 
 Since when? 
 Saturday night. 
 How? 
 An overdose. 
 Well, why would he do that? 
 I thought you might be able to tell me. 
 I can't tell you anything. 
 Maybe it's pretty obvious. 
 Ziegler and Griffiths died on the same day, right? 
 So maybe Griffiths killed Ziegler. 
 I don't know why - you can find that out. 
 He killed him, then he regretted it and he took his own life. 
 He left a note. 
 Yeah? 
 "It wasn't me, I wasn't responsible." 
 That's all it said. 
 There you are - it's a confession. 
 How well did you know him? 
 I never met him before in my life. 
 For a man you never met, he seemed to have quite an affect on you. 
 He was the boring head of a boring committee, we all felt the same. 
 How did you get to be on that committee? 
 As a matter of fact, I volunteered. 
 I was killing time. 
 After you'd finished in Devon? 
 Yeah. 
 What is it you were doing in Devon? 
 What is this, the Third Degree? 
 Look, Christopher, I'd like to help you, I really would, but you know I can't. 
 And I can't let you leave. 
 You know that. 
 You think you can stop me? 
 I have a wife. 
 I have two sons that I haven't seen in over three years. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I thought we were friends, Christopher. 
 Well, so did I. 
 Mr Longmate is ready to see you now. 
 Thank you. 
 I have to say, this is a terrible business. 
 Almost unbelievable. 
 A murder, now of all times! 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, have you made any progress? 
 Perhaps. Um... Just a couple of things, if you don't mind. 
 Excuse me. 
 Well, anything I can do to help. 
 You first met Dr Ziegler when? 
 Same time as you, at the committee. 
 You were never a patient of his, then? 
 No. 
 Mm-hm. 
 What's the matter with your eyes, if you don't mind me asking? 
 I beg your pardon? 
 I remember you telling Dr Ziegler your eyesight was the reason you were exempt from the armed forces. 
 Nothing wrong with that, of course, but you're not wearing glasses and you didn't seem to have a problem reading at the meeting. 
 Well, er... 
 I might as well come clean. 
 Actually, I lied. 
 The real reason why I was exempted was angina. 
 I have a heart condition. 
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 I want to go into politics, Mr Foyle. 
 Do you think the people of Hastings would vote for someone with a weak heart? 
 You feel they'd sooner vote for someone who lies? 
 I think you're being a little harsh. 
 The next election may be tougher than anyone thinks. 
 I just don't want to give my political opponents any ammunition, that's all. 
 I'm well enough to stand for parliament, I know I am. 
 I want to serve my country, Mr Foyle. 
 That may sound hopelessly old-fashioned, but I'm not gonna let this chance pass me by. 
 Sir, did you notice the woman leaving his office just then? 
 His assistant. 
 Mm. 
 I met her a few days ago with Edith. 
 They were both patients of Dr Ziegler. 
 Know what he was treating her for? 
 No, but I have a pretty good idea. 
 Well, it's got to be one of them. 
 Major Kiefer or Martin Longmate. 
 They were both in the room. 
 Or it could have been that curator chap, I suppose. 
 Michael Brown. 
 It could have been me. 
 Didn't like to mention it, sir. 
 What did you get on Griffiths' military service? 
 Nothing, sir. 
 It's all definitely hush-hush. 
 I made a few calls, but it's a brick wall. 
 But he was in the West Country. 
 As was Kiefer. 
 Has your letter arrived, by the way? 
 My promotion? 
 Mm-hm. 
 No, sir. Still no news. 
 Can't you give them a call, sir? 
 Chivvy them on a bit. 
 It'll come. 
 With your permission, I'd like to talk to Mrs Hylton while you're away. Certainly. 
 Where are you going, sir? 
 London. 
 You're about to run me to the station. 
 Can I ask why you're going to London, sir? 
 Course you can. 
 Miss Pierce? 
 Mr Foyle. 
 I was very surprised to be getting your call. 
 I was very surprised to be making it, quite honestly. 
 How's Hastings? 
 Much the same as here, I'd imagine. 
 We're just waiting. 
 The end of the war. 
 I understand Churchill and Stalin are negotiating the exact moment to announce it. 
 Meanwhile, I can reliably inform you that you can expect an announcement on the wireless this evening. 
 What, that it's over? 
 No. 
 The Ministry of Information is going to announce that there'll be an announcement tomorrow. 
 In other words, the announcement of the announcement. 
 Good to see the spirit of Colonel Blimp is still alive and well. 
 You said you wanted my help. 
 That makes a pleasant change. 
 Well, since you've been so very unhelpful on two separate occasions during the course of the war so far, I'm giving you a chance to make up for it. 
 Point taken. 
 I just need some information. 
 Go on. 
 Sometime last year, maybe this, in the west of England, Devon perhaps, something happened. 
 A naval operation involving the Americans on a beach, maybe. 
 Can you be a little more specific? 
 Well, no. 
 I just have one name. Griffiths. 
 Mark Griffiths, Royal Signals. 
 You've made inquiries? 
 Nobody will talk to me. 
 What makes you think they'll talk to me? 
 I'll need a couple of hours. 
 All right. 
 Er... Where will you be? 
 Wherever you like. 
 How about Whitehall? Kingly Street should be quiet enough. 
 You've seen - there are crowds everywhere. 
 All waiting for the end. 
 Everyone's out there celebrating, and here are you and I, still stuck in the shadows. 
 I thought you liked the shadows. 
 Five o'clock. Good to see you again. 
 Mrs Hylton? 
 Yes. 
 Sergeant Milner, Hastings Police. 
 I've come about Dr Ziegler. 
 Well, you'd better come in. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you on your own? 
 No, my husband Eddie's upstairs, asleep. 
 Demobbed? 
 Yeah, he was in Italy. 
 You don't remember meeting me, do you? 
 No. 
 I was with my wife, Edith. 
 She's pregnant. 
 Your husband doesn't need to know anything about this, but I do. 
 Please. 
 When you met my wife at Dr Ziegler's surgery, you were heavily pregnant. 
 Where is the baby? 
 She's with my mother. 
 And your husband has no idea? 
 He suspects. He knows something's not right, but... 
 I do love him. 
 But he's been away for four years. 
 I was on my own. 
 I wish it hadn't happened, but it did. 
 And now he's back, and I've been tearing myself apart. 
 I can't tell him - he'd kill me. 
 But Dr Ziegler knew. 
 I was terrified he'd tell Eddie about me, about me and the baby. 
 Is that why you went to the museum? 
 To see him? 
 No. 
 I went to see Martin. Mr Longmate. 
 He's the father. 
 Right. 
 We didn't mean for it to happen. 
 He was on his own, too. 
 His wife had died in a bombing raid. 
 I felt sorry for him, and... one night we were working late... 
 Does he know the baby's his? 
 He wanted to get rid of it. 
 But I couldn't do that. 
 So then he said he knew people. 
 Said he could arrange for it to be adopted. 
 And that's what we were gonna do. 
 But then your husband came home. 
 I've been so scared. 
 I don't want to lose him, I couldn't bear that. 
 If he finds out... 
 Eddie mentioned he was seeing Dr Ziegler. 
 I panicked. 
 I had to talk to someone, and I thought Martin would know what to do. 
 So I went to the museum. 
 But it was too late. 
 You didn't see Mr Longmate? 
 No. He'd already gone. 
 That's all I need to know. 
 Will you be coming back? 
 No. 
 I have everything. 
 I'll see myself out. 
 [ DOOR CLOSES ] 
 I heard. 
 Everything. 
 You like to inhabit dangerous territory, Mr Foyle. 
 Well, not by choice. 
 This time, even you should tread carefully. 
 I've stuck my neck out for you, and I have to say, I felt a very cold breeze indeed. 
 Operation Tiger - does that mean anything to you? 
 Might. 
 Slapton Sands in Devon. 
 What happened there? 
 Nothing happened there. 
 That's the official verdict, and that's how it shall remain for years to come. 
 Unofficially? 
 You never spoke to me, I never gave you this, and it would be better if nobody ever found out you knew anything about it. 
 All right. 
 Just remember, a war always hides a great many dirty secrets. 
 This has been a long war... 
 ..and this secret's very dirty indeed. 
 He wanted her to get rid of it, but she refused, so he was going to get it adopted. 
 It turns out Martin Longmate's not as straightforward as he seems. 
 Was he ever? 
 Sergeant. 
 What's going on? 
 Oh, nothing, sir. 
 It's er...in the... 
 It's just that cartoon, sir. 
 You probably don't read it. Jane. 
 Not a stitch on today, I see. 
 You probably noticed that. 
 Yes, sir. The lads and I were just commenting on it. 
 I suppose it's to mark the end of the war. 
 Well, not a moment too soon, if that's anything to go by. 
 Right, sir. 
 We're just off to Wilder Road, take a peek at the new HQ. 
 I should. 
 Paul! It's here. 
 I should open it. 
 I've got it. 
 Darling! 
 Sir, thank you. 
 Congratulations. 
 Oh! 
 Edith? 
 I came here at such a pace, I... 
 Paul, I think it's coming! 
 Er... Chair. 
 Get Brooke back, will you? 
 What's the um...hospital number? 
 383. 
 Where's Sam? 
 She's um...with the Servicemen's Association this morning. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Paul. 
 Don't worry. 
 (GROANS) 
 Missed him, sir. 
 Never mind. Thank you. 
 (DIALS NUMBER) 
 That's it. We're nearly there. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Good luck. 
 I think it's time you explained. 
 If it's all in there, what else do you want to know? 
 I want to hear it from your point of view. I wasn't there. 
 It was a training exercise at Slapton Sands, for the landings at Utah Beach. 
 Operation Tiger. 
 A year ago, April 28. 
 I'd been transferred to the amphibious truck company, working on floating harbours and LSTs. 
 Landing ships, tanks, that kind of stuff. 
 I was billeted with the 4th Infantry division. 
 I got to know a lot of the boys. 
 That's what most of them were. 
 Just kids. 
 A few years older than my own. 
 Anyway, one night, right in the middle of an exercise... 
 ..nine German U-boats came out of nowhere. 
 And there was a whole fleet of LSTs, just sitting there, right in front of them. 
 So they opened fire. 
 749 of our soldiers and sailors killed. 
 It was all hushed up. 
 They had to think about morale. 
 So why did nobody warn the kids on the LSTs that the Germans were on their way? 
 Well, I'll tell you. 
 They did. 
 But it turned out there'd been a typing mistake. 
 Someone had sent out the wrong radio frequency. 
 Just a couple of misplaced numbers, that's all. 
 So no-one on the LSTs heard anything, and all those people died. 
 And that was Griffiths. 
 Took me a year to find out. 
 Talking to the right people. 
 Asking a lot of questions about something that wasn't supposed to have happened. 
 But he was the one responsible. 
 Griffiths was a major with the Royal Signals Corps, Allied Liaison. 
 He did the right thing, then, killing himself. No! 
 You don't understand. 
 I see those kids. 
 Every night, I see them. 
 I can't get them out of my head. 
 I just wanted him to accept responsibility, that's all. 
 I thought if he did that, then maybe I could make sense of it. 
 Well, the fact is nobody knows what happened. 
 Radio frequencies were changed, the Germans noticed increased radio traffic. 
 While the corvettes didn't show up, the LSTs were in the wrong formation, so whatever you may think, it wasn't one man's mistake. 
 Griffiths was in charge, and at the end of it, they just shipped him out, they got rid of him. 
 As far as he was concerned, that was the end of it. 
 He just ran out. 
 And it was really worth hounding him to death? 
 I didn't want him to die. 
 That wasn't the idea, I swear to it. 
 I don't know what I wanted. 
 I should never have come. 
 Well, it's a bit late for that. 
 So now what? 
 From the law's point of view, there's not a case against you that would stand up in a court. 
 So you're free to go. 
 So that's it, then? 
 I think so, don't you? 
 Funny thing about war, Christopher - people change. 
 Or are you the only one who remained above it all? 
 So what are you going to do with yourself, Sam? 
 After the war? 
 I don't even want to think about it. 
 But it looks as if advertising and politics are out. 
 How about you? 
 I don't know. 
 Will you stay in Hastings? 
 Mm, I suppose so. 
 I'll go fishing with Dad, and we'll spend some time together. 
 I haven't really got anywhere else to go. 
 Well, will you fly again? 
 My eyesight is more or less shot to pieces with the sinusitis, so no. 
 I think that's finished. 
 You'll have to go into business, then. 
 Or maybe you can join the police. 
 Mm. Then you can be MY driver. 
 I don't think so! 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 That's the worst of it, Sam. 
 This feeling I have that maybe the best of my life is over. 
 Flying the dawn patrol, the friends I made. 
 Even the ones I lost. 
 How can I work in an office, travel in and out on a 37 bus, after what I've been through? 
 How can any of us? 
 Maybe you could write. 
 You used to write reams of poetry. 
 Well, I used to scribble a bit, I suppose. 
 What was that poem you told me? 
 Oh, I don't remember. 
 Oh, please, Andrew. 
 Actually, I wrote one quite recently, just before I left Malta. 
 Go on. 
 I don't know if it was any good or not, but... 
 It's called "All Clear." 
 They've sounded out the last all clear And told us, those who made it here... 
 ..That very soon we'll hold once more Those things that we held dear. 
 Yet nothing's clear to me. 
 I gaze from darkness to a summer haze. 
 And though they part, the clouds of war lead only to uncertain days. 
 Do you really think that? 
 I think that's very sad. 
 (GROANS) Sam, I'm sorry. 
 I've got to watch out for myself. 
 I'm beginning to sound like an old man. 
 Well, you don't look like one. 
 Sam, why don't we get married? 
 What?! 
 I mean it. 
 You don't know what you're going to do, I don't know what I'm going to do - it makes sense to not know what we're going to do together. 
 Is that why you invited me here? 
 Don't get angry with me. 
 I said I'd be your friend. 
 I said I'd see you again, but that's all. 
 It's unfair to ask for more. 
 Especially in so unromantic a fashion. 
 All right. 
 But I might as well tell you, I'm going to work on you, Sam. 
 Until one day you'll change your mind about me, and forgive me for being such a bloody fool. 
 And you will marry me. 
 Oh, yes? 
 If only because you'd secretly love to have my dad as your father-in-law. 
 Hm... 
 Let's drive back and get a pint. 
 All right. 
 Everything all right? 
 Mr Longmate, could I have a word? 
 Of course. Shall we use my office? 
 Probably wise. 
 Please, follow me. 
 Is this about Dr Ziegler? 
 Who else? 
 Well, please, sit down. 
 No, I won't stay longer than I have to. 
 Perhaps you should. 
 Should I? 
 With a heart condition like yours, you can't be too careful. 
 That's very considerate, but um... 
 I'll be fine, thank you. 
 How can I help you? 
 Well, we hoped you might help with whatever you can remember about your military service medical. 
 It was a long time ago, Mr Foyle. 
 I can't see why you'd be interested. 
 Some confusion about the details, apparently. 
 Might you remember where it took place? 
 Er... London, though precisely where I would be less sure about. 
 Mm-hm. Examining doctor, perhaps? 
 Afraid not. 
 I see. 
 Though there's probably a record of it somewhere, if you think it's important. 
 Well, there's um... there's a record of it in my pocket. 
 A doctor's letter recording an appointment for... 
 Martin Longmate, April 23rd, 1941. 
 At a surgery in London, Hampstead, with signed confirmation of angina and exemption from active service. 
 Would this be your appointment? 
 You'll forgive me pointing out, but if you have the information, I fail to see why you're questioning me regarding it. 
 And why on earth you consider there to be a problem. 
 Well, certainly not a problem for me. 
 It just looks as if it might be for you. 
 It's a question of the signature here of the examining doctor. 
 You're saying it's not genuine? 
 No, far from it. 
 I'm saying it's Dr Ziegler's. 
 Longmate. We've met, I think. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Martin Longmate. 
 I feel sure I know the name. 
 So why say you hadn't met? 
 It was four years ago, for God's sake. 
 I do meet a lot of people. 
 They all give you medicals? 
 Not a very good reason, perhaps, is because you never had. 
 Because the Martin Longmate he examined wasn't you, was it? 
 You don't know what you're talking about. 
 He examined the man you paid £150 to take your place, who does have angina, and who had a very nice line in acquiring exemption certificates for those interested in avoiding military service, until his arrest the other day. 
 He sends his regards. 
 It was actually er...£200. 
 Was it? 
 Oh. 
 We'll remind him. Thank you. 
 Life, eh? 
 Almost the end of the war and you run into the very last person in England you want to see. 
 I panicked. 
 When he asked me about my exemption, I told him it was my eyesight because...if I'd said angina, he might have put two and two together. 
 There was too much to lose - my...political ambitions, my business. 
 And then when I heard him asking to speak to you... 
 Actually, Mr Foyle, there was one thing I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Um... It's a private matter. 
 I wonder if I might call in at the police station. 
 Any time you like. 
 'All I could think of was getting rid of Ziegler before he could talk to you. 
 And that's exactly what I did.' 
 (GROANS) 
 What gave me away? 
 You were the first to leave the committee room, but Kiefer was the first out of the building, according to the doorman. 
 Ah. 
 All so unnecessary and unfortunate. 
 What do you mean? 
 All Ziegler wanted to speak to me about was Griffiths, who was in a very bad state. 
 Ziegler was concerned. 
 And unfortunate, because er... having evaded the draft, murdered a member of the medical profession, tried to avoid detection to feather your own nest, I'd have said you were a born politician. 
 But, the law being what it is, hanging is perhaps the very best way you can serve your country. 
 Make the most, lads. 
 It's a bona fide French champagne. 
 Well, congratulations, Mr Milner. 
 Just celebrating the new arrival, sir. Hope you don't mind. 
 Well, of course not. Boy or a girl? 
 A girl, sir. Thank heavens. 
 Goodbye to Winston Milner. 
 But she wants to call her Clementine - Mrs Churchill. 
 Where's this come from? 
 The evidence room, sir. 
 Somehow the label came adrift and sadly, we couldn't place it. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, congratulations. 
 Cheers. 
 Congratulations. 
 Sir! 
 Cheers. 
 'The Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Winston Churchill.' 
 Churchill : 'Yesterday morning, at 2:41am... 
 ..at General Eisenhower's headquarters, General Jodl, the representative of the German High Command, and our Grand Admiral Donitz, the designated head of the German state, signed the act of unconditional surrender of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe to the Allied Expeditionary Force.' 
 It's over. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Sir, I'd better get back to Edith and er...Clementine. 
 Of course. 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 And er...if you don't mind, sir, I promised the lads that they could join in the celebrations. 
 It seems only right. 
 Absolutely. Go ahead. 
 Cheers, sir. Enjoy the champers. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, lads. 
 They said you drove Milner and his wife to the hospital, sir. 
 I did. 
 But I thought you couldn't drive. 
 Are you telling me that all these years... 
 I've never actually at any time said I couldn't drive, I just preferred not to. 
 So you never really needed me? 
 I wouldn't say that. 
 All hell's breaking loose outside. 
 You ought to come and join us. 
 I will. 
 I'm going to dance all night. 
 Will you dance with me? 
 I'll dance with anybody. 
 But especially you. 
 Are you coming, Dad? 
 No, I'll catch you up. You go on. 
 All right. 
 Are you sure? We'll never find you. 
 I'll make sure you do. Off you go. 
 Andrew.
