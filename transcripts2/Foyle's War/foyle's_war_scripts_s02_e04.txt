 Matthew. 
 How many more? 
 We've got enough. 
 There's more room in the van. 
 We've plenty. Let's get out of here. 
 Are you scared? 
 Too bloody right. 
 He's right, Len. We can come back. 
 One more load. 
 Halt! Who goes there? 
 Hell. 
 Move it! 
 Stop! Don't move. We're armed. 
 Come on! 
 Stay where you are! 
 Dan! 
 Len! 
 Matthew! 
 Oi, move. 
 He's been hit. 
 Shut up! 
 I think you hit him.

 [ EXPLOSIONS ] 
 (BABY CRIES OUT) 
 It's madness. 
 It's madness. 
 Nobody cares about us. 
 400 killed last night. 
 400 in the flames and the fire. 
 Did you hear any ack-ack? 
 No, there wasn't any. 
 They don't care. 
 They're not down here, are they? 
 Churchill and the rest of 'em. 
 It's their war but we have to put up with it night after night after night. 
 Come on, love. 
 It's not that bad. 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 We're not going to win this war. 
 They pushed us out of Norway and France, now they're in Romania. 
 Nobody can stop them. 
 (PEOPLE CRY OUT) 
 If we don't have a negotiated peace, we'll be crushed, we'll be destroyed. 
 Oh, shut up! 
 What do you know about it, anyway? 
 I DO know. 
 I'm with the police, I know what's happening. 
 You'll get in trouble saying that. 
 It's talking sedition. 
 He doesn't mean it. 
 The Jerries have won, we might as well pack up. 
 Woman : That won't help anyone. 
 I'm telling you. 
 They don't want you to know but we've already lost. 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 Have you found it yet? 
 No. 
 It must be in here. 
 Sam? 
 This what you're looking for? 
 Oh, where was it? 
 In the kitchen, in a biscuit tin. 
 Of course. 
 Thanks. 
 Been here long? 
 A few minutes, sir. 
 It was the car. It was immobilised. 
 You mean you immobilised it? 
 Well...yes. 
 Following regulations. 
 I left in a hurry last night and I forgot where I hid the distributor cap. 
 At least you got here. 
 Bad luck about the train, sir. 
 At least while they're bombing the railways they're sparing the houses. 
 So how was London? 
 Well, a quarter of a million homeless, civil administration almost nonexistent, no builders, no materials for repairs, rest centres are overcrowded, not enough mobile canteens and in the shelters there's up to 300 people using as little as two latrines. 
 What about voluntary services? 
 They do a great job but if you've got 500 tons of bombs being dropped per night there's only so much they can do. 
 There's too many dying. 
 Do you think it's going to get as bad as that down here, sir? 
 God forbid. 
 It's all right, Matthew. 
 Where's Len? 
 I don't know. He said he'd be here. 
 I want a doctor. 
 And he'll get you a doctor. 
 How is it? 
 I can't feel anything. 
 That's good. It's good, isn't it? 
 You don't want to feel any pain. 
 Do you want something to eat? 
 We've got er, tinned salmon, tinned peaches, chocolate. 
 You wouldn't believe half the stuff we've got in here. 
 There's 50 quid's worth of sugar. 
 Len said we'd get 100 quid for it, 200 even. 
 It's like Ali Baba's cave. 
 I want a doctor. 
 He's going to get you a doctor. 
 'Ey, look at me. 
 You're going to be fine. 
 OK? 
 [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] 
 Hello, sir. 
 Miller. 
 Good to have you back. 
 Thank you. Busy? 
 Not a lot going on, sir. 
 Bomb fell on a cemetery in Upperton. 
 Nobody killed but a few dead bodies. 
 Old ones are always the best, eh? 
 There was a break-in at a food depot just outside Hailsham yesterday. 
 A Home Guard opened fire on three men in a van. 
 He may have hit one of them. 
 Who are they? 
 Bird-watchers. Came over from Bristol looking for rare birds. 
 Twitchers - why were they arresting them? 
 They were selling them as meat. 
 Business as usual, then. 
 There is something else. 
 There's a Kate Farley here, says her son is missing. 
 It's not like him. 
 Not to stop out all night. 
 I mean, he'd let me know and when he didn't come home this morning...I - 
 When did he go out? 
 I couldn't say. 
 I'm at the factory all hours, I don't get home till after 10. 
 Listen, your son's been missing less than 24 hours, why are you worried about him so soon? 
 He's been keeping the wrong kind of company. 
 He's got this friend. 
 The two of them are thick as thieves. 
 Now Daniel's a bit of no-good. 
 I knew something bad would happen, I told Matthew. 
 Daniel...? 
 Parker. 
 They do odd jobs at Brookfield Court. 
 Have you heard of it? 
 Remind me. 
 Everyone in the village knows about Brookfield Court. 
 It's a big place and they've turned it into a sort of guesthouse. 
 Guests is one word for it. 
 What's another? 
 It's not for me to say but... 
 I wish my boy had never set foot in that place. 
 Are you going to look into this? 
 I'll start with Brookfield Court. 
 I should. Let me know. 
 Sir. 
 Argh! 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I'm too old for this. 
 Nonsense. Not at all. No. 
 You were unlucky. 
 What's the score? 
 30-40. 
 Right. 
 Your serve. 
 Yep, come on. 
 [ DOG BARKS ] 
 Charlie. Come here. 
 Come to heel. 
 Oh, go away. Go on, go away. 
 Ugh! 
 Have I told you I loathe dogs? 
 Yes, Miss Reece. Many times. 
 An animal in creation for which there appears to be no apparent reason. 
 If I'd known Mrs Powell took dogs, I'd have thought twice before coming. 
 I wish you had, Miss Reece. 
 I hope you're not going to leave me by the car. 
 Mr Foyle always does. 
 Quite a place. 
 How the other half live! 
 You wouldn't think there's a war on. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Shh. 
 Who are you? 
 The name's Milner. 
 I'm a detective sergeant with Hastings Police. 
 Police? Why? What do you want? 
 I'm looking for the owner. 
 Mrs Powell, through there. 
 Thank you. 
 Hello. 
 Writing? 
 Yes, that's what it would look like, wouldn't it? I'm trying to. 
 Oh. 
 Sorry. Are you a novelist? 
 I'm a journalist. 
 I write articles for magazines. 
 I wouldn't have thought there was much to write about here. 
 Well, you'd be wrong. 
 I haven't seen Matthew Farley for a couple of days, Mr Milner. 
 Or Daniel Parker. 
 They're very close so if you find one, you'll probably find the other. 
 They both work here? 
 Occasionally. 
 Parker works in the kitchen. 
 Odd jobs, that sort of thing. 
 Matthew helps out in the garden. 
 You have two gardeners? 
 It's a big garden. 
 Matthew lives with his mother in Hastings. 
 If you want to talk to Parker, I suggest you try the village. 
 He has a room above a shop. 
 [ BELL RINGS ] 
 Oh, will you excuse me? 
 It's my husband. 
 Who is it? 
 It's a police officer, Malcolm. 
 He's with me now. 
 Detective Sergeant Milner, sir. 
 What do you want? 
 We're looking for a young man, Matthew Farley. 
 He's been reported missing. 
 Dan Parker's friend. 
 Parker is a good-for-nothing. 
 His friend is a layabout. 
 We don't have a great deal of choice. 
 Getting help of any sort isn't easy these days. 
 How many guests are staying here? 
 We have six. 
 Mr and Mrs Joseph, Mr and Mrs Hardiman. 
 Amanda Reece, she's a writer, and Mr Vaudrey is our most recent arrival. 
 And are they staying long? 
 All our guests are...here for the duration. 
 Would you let me know if Matthew or his friend come back? 
 They're louts. That's the generation we fought for - waste of time. 
 I don't know why we bothered. 
 My husband lost his sight in the War. 
 It was a mustard gas attack at Ypres. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It was the war to end all wars, that's what we thought and... now here we are again. 
 Hello. 
 Do you work here? 
 Yes, that's right. 
 Weeding. 
 That's what it looks like. 
 Who are you? 
 Sam Stewart. I'm with the police. 
 What are you doing here? 
 We're looking for someone. 
 He's gone missing. 
 Gone missing from where? 
 Home, I suppose. 
 Name of Matthew Farley, do you know him? 
 Never heard of him. 
 Well, that's funny, because he works here too. 
 Well, I keep myself to myself. 
 I prefer it that way. 
 Pentstemon. 
 What? 
 The plant you've just dug up is a pentstemon. 
 It's a flower not a weed. 
 My father does a lot of gardening. 
 He's a vicar. 
 Bully for him. 
 I heard an interesting rumour that you're a police officer. 
 Who told you that, sir? 
 You can't sneeze here without somebody noticing. 
 I saw you playing tennis just now. 
 Oh, yes, yes. With Max Joseph. 
 Well, he's a Jew but not a bad sort. 
 Are you er... Are you here for any reason in particular? 
 Yes. I'm looking for Matthew Farley. 
 Oh. 
 The odd-job boy. 
 Yes, I haven't seen him recently. 
 Erm, but listen, if you've got a moment or two you might want to check out Frank Vaudrey. 
 Have you got that? R-E-Y. 
 Came down from London recently. 
 Check him out for what, sir? 
 Don't ask me to do your job for you, old boy. 
 I'm only trying to help. 
 Friendly sort, aren't they (?) 
 Just get me out of here, would you, Sam? 
 With pleasure. 
 Well, how was tennis? 
 Three sets to none. 
 You really should let him win now and then. 
 It goes against the grain. 
 I've been speaking to the police. 
 Yes, I heard they were here. 
 I told them to check up on our friend Vaudrey. 
 Did you? 
 Mmm. 
 Interesting to see what they come up with. 
 I'm not sure that was a good idea. 
 What, a fiver out of your purse? 
 Those cufflinks were Cartier. 
 You don't know it was him. 
 He doesn't fit in here. 
 Besides, it only started after he arrived. 
 You're such a snob. 
 What, and you aren't? 
 What do you think? 
 It's a funk hole, sir. 
 I'd agree with you. 
 What's a funk hole? 
 It's a hiding place for people with more money than conscience who buy their way out of the war. 
 There are hotels like Brookfield Court all over the country. 
 Some took reservations on the day that the Germans invaded Poland. 
 Brookfield Court is advertised in the local press. 
 (READS) Brookfield Court. 
 A haven for the sensitive and artistic seeking comfort in a secluded location. 
 Out of harm's way. 
 Cowards. 
 They can't do that, can they? 
 Nobody to stop them. 
 Did you find anything? 
 No sign of Farley or Parker, sir. 
 A guest suggested I look into a man called Frank Vaudrey who's also staying there. 
 Did he say why? 
 No. 
 I've sent a routine enquiry up to Scotland Yard. 
 You should ask about the gardener too. 
 [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] 
 Why's that? 
 Well, he knew nothing about gardening, I can tell you that. 
 Matthew Farley may well have turned up. Get on to his mother again. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yes. 
 Where is he? 
 I'll be there right away. 
 Sam. 
 How bad is it, sir? 
 They didn't say. 
 At least he's still in one piece. 
 They didn't say that either. 
 Andrew. 
 Dad. 
 Are you all right? 
 Not too bad. 
 Shouldn't you be in bed? 
 I couldn't stand being cooped up. 
 Have you seen the quack? 
 No, I saw one of the nurses. 
 How bad is it? 
 Well, I've hurt my arm and... 
 ..a few cuts and bruises but... 
 I'll live. 
 What happened? 
 This fog... 
 A couple of hundred feet of it. 
 I couldn't see the ground. 
 I thought you'd been shot down. 
 No. 
 I couldn't find the aerodrome so I tried to find a field. 
 But they all had poles stuck in or ditches, you know, anti-invasion. 
 In the end I ran out of fuel so I had to come down in the drink. 
 The plane flipped over and... this happened. 
 In a way I was lucky. 
 I thought I'd bought it. 
 What happens now then? 
 I get a week's crash leave. 
 So it looks like I can come home. 
 Thank you for agreeing to see me, sir. 
 You're talking about Christopher Foyle, for heaven's sake. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Are you sure there's no mistake? 
 That was my first assumption, sir. 
 That's why I double-checked everything before I came to you. 
 Have you spoken to anyone else? 
 No, sir. 
 Quite right. 
 Foyle's a first-class detective who's running the entire South Coast. 
 If there's any truth in it, it would be catastrophic. 
 Are you saying... 
 Are you saying you want me to bury the investigation, sir? 
 No, no we can't do that. 
 But was he in London? 
 He came up for a conference. 
 Directorate of Emergency Works. 
 Oh, yeah, I was there. 
 I didn't meet him. 
 No, he stayed near St Paul's, sir. 
 Less than a mile from where the incident took place. 
 This was a public shelter. 
 We have witness statements. 
 They all gave accurate descriptions. 
 One of them even confirmed his name. 
 Madness. I don't believe this. 
 I don't believe any of it. 
 Sir, if I may... 
 Go on. 
 I don't think this is as serious as it seems. 
 War does different things to different people. 
 It's impossible to know how anyone will react. 
 DCS Foyle, he's a good man but he's had no experience of what the Germans have been throwing at us in the capital. 
 I'd have said it's understandable if he'd been caught up in his first major raid and panicked. 
 Panicked? That's not what we're talking about, you know that. 
 But, sir - 
 This is sedition. 
 Spreading alarm and despondency is a breach of defence regulations. 
 Only last week a GPO telephone operator was fined £25 for spreading a rumour that German parachutists had landed in Kent. 
 This is worse. Much, much worse. 
 What do you want me to do, sir? 
 I want him suspended from duties and an investigation launched. 
 Sir, I don't think that's fair. 
 Fair? 
 There may be special circumstances. 
 No, we can't make exceptions, you know that as well as I do. 
 But in this case, sir, I suggest we do. 
 Let me go down to Hastings and sort this out. 
 We must do this by the book. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Matt, I've brought you some... 
 Want me to do that? 
 It's been a while since I did. 
 No, thanks. 
 Actually, I'm not very hungry. 
 Sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 What are you going to do today? 
 I haven't really thought. 
 Well, erm.. sitting around moping on your own isn't going to do any good, is it? 
 I'll be all right. 
 I've got the wireless. 
 I can read. 
 Arm all right? 
 Not too bad. 
 Why don't you get somebody over...that Douglas fellow? 
 He died. 
 Went down in the Channel. 
 Sorry. 
 Douglas, Rex... 
 I don't really have many friends left. 
 Listen - 
 Don't worry about me, Dad. 
 I'm just feeling sorry for myself. 
 If you want the truth, my arm hurts like... 
 Look, I don't have to go in. 
 I can take the day off. 
 We can do something. 
 You've not done that in 20 years. 
 There's always a first time. 
 No. 
 I'll be all right. I'll be fine. 
 Everything all right, sir? 
 Yes, thanks. 
 No, not really. 
 I'm just wondering if erm... 
 Are you doing anything this evening? 
 Are you asking me out, sir? 
 Steady on, Miss Stewart. No. 
 I'm thinking about erm...Andrew. 
 Is he all right? 
 No. Well, I don't know. 
 I'm a bit worried about him. He's not himself because of this accident and I thought...maybe erm... it'll do him a bit of good to get out a bit. 
 You mean... with me? 
 Well, no, no, no, no. 
 A drive in the countryside? 
 Perfect. 
 Yes. 
 We shouldn't use up too much fuel. 
 No, of course not. 
 Not too far. Just a breath of fresh air, change of scenery. 
 It'll be a pleasure, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Good afternoon. 
 Good afternoon, sir. 
 James Collier. 
 I telephoned from London. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 This break-in in Hailsham. 
 It's not far from Brookfield Court. 
 Just the other side of the wood. 
 Coincidence? 
 Three men - one of them shot. 
 And a van. 
 Still no sign of Matthew. 
 I spoke to his mother this morning. 
 Both he and Daniel Parker work at Brookfield Court, right? 
 Hmm. 
 Daniel Parker's got a room with... 
 Leonard Holmes, who runs the village shop. 
 Right. And with everybody buying under the counter these days... 
 If you want to distribute stolen food... 
 Exactly. 
 Ladies, wait your turn. 
 I'll be with you in a moment. 
 YOU are in luck, Mrs Powell. 
 A nice bit of liver. 
 Last of the meat. 
 Want me to wrap it up for you? 
 You can't deliver, Mr Holmes? 
 No. Trouble with the van. 
 Excuse me. 
 Mrs Farley. 
 Is there no more meat? 
 Sorry, you should've got here earlier. 
 I've been queuing for half an hour. 
 Excuse me. 
 It's not fair. 
 I've lived here all my life and then you come and take for people who aren't even from round here. 
 I've not done any wrong. All my guests are registered at this shop. 
 Guests? That's one word for 'em. 
 Come on now, ladies! 
 They're cowards, all of 'em. 
 They're hiding from the war. 
 And, you...you ought to be ashamed. 
 Making money out of 'em. 
 I might have a couple of sausages out the back. 
 Give her the sausages and us the food we want to eat. 
 Please, let me pass. 
 I want to go home. 
 Go back to your rotten funk hole. 
 Our men are fighting this war and if they knew it was for people like you they wouldn't bother. 
 Len. 
 What do you want? 
 Is he? 
 Course he is, you daft sod. 
 He's dead as mutton. 
 God! 
 Pull yourself together, Dan, all right? 
 This wasn't our fault. 
 We didn't shoot him. 
 No. But we were there. 
 Nobody knows that. 
 There's nothing to connect either of us with him. 
 OK, what do we do? 
 We've got to get him out of here. 
 We'll bury him in the wood. 
 What? 
 What else can we do? Do you want to call out the local vicar? 
 What about his mother? 
 We've got no choice. 
 We'll put him in the wood. 
 You never said anyone would get hurt, Len. 
 How was I to know? 
 Now, YOU pull yourself together! 
 Go and get a spade. 
 There's not much more I can tell you, sir. 
 It's all in my report. 
 There were three of them. 
 I challenged them to stop. 
 They refused, so I opened fire. 
 Did you see any of them? 
 No. Not clearly. 
 But you're sure you hit one of them? 
 Yes, sir, I'm afraid so. 
 I feel bad about that. 
 No, not at all. 
 Just doing your duty. 
 Yes, sir, I know. 
 What makes you so sure you hit him? 
 He shouted out, sir. 
 What did he say? 
 I think he swore, sir. 
 "Damn!" or something. 
 Damn? 
 "Dan", perhaps? Someone's name? 
 I couldn't be sure, sir. 
 [ DOOR CLOSES ] 
 Parker? 
 What are you doing here? 
 You wanted the stove cleaning, Mrs Powell. 
 That was three days ago. 
 Where have you been? 
 In and out. 
 Well, that's not true. 
 The police were looking for you. 
 And what did you tell them? 
 I told them I hadn't seen you. 
 But I was here on Wednesday evening. 
 No, you weren't. 
 I think your memory's playing you false again, Mrs Powell, cos I was definitely here. 
 You and me, we look out for each other, don't we? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You know, since I've worked here, I've got to know one or two things, haven't I? 
 But I keep my mouth shut and I get on with my job, just like I was doing on Wednesday evening. 
 Do you know what I mean? 
 Sam. 
 Hello. 
 Dad not with you? 
 No. 
 He's working late. 
 So what are you... 
 Well, he mentioned you were on your own at home and I was erm... 
 I'm just on my way to have tea and I was wondering if you'd join me. 
 For tea? 
 Yes. I've got the car. 
 Erm...that's very kind of you, Sam, but I'm not hungry. 
 Oh. 
 You can sit and watch me eat because I'm absolutely starving. 
 Come on, Andrew. 
 I'm likely to get a decent portion if I'm seen with an airman. 
 Anyway, I hate eating on my own. 
 Don't you want a sandwich? 
 I'm not hungry. 
 I'm always hungry. 
 I hope rationing doesn't get worse. 
 I'm having to put treacle in my tea. 
 It tastes quite disgusting. 
 And it goes sort of black so it looks disgusting too. 
 What's the food like in the RAF? 
 So-so. 
 It's frightful bad luck coming down the way you did. 
 I don't know. I got a week's leave. 
 That's true. 
 Funny... we've never really got a chance to sit down together. 
 What happened to that girl you were seeing? 
 We broke up. 
 Oh. 
 I'm sorry to hear it. 
 So you're all on your own. 
 Are you sure you won't have one? 
 No. 
 These sandwiches would be better if they put something inside them. 
 You must be having an awful time. 
 What makes you say that? 
 I've seen the dogfights over the Channel. 
 And, of course, I listen to the wireless. 
 I can't imagine what it must be like. 
 You've no idea how proud we are of you. 
 Is that why you invited me out to tea? 
 No. 
 I didn't like the idea of you moping in the house on your own. 
 Moping? 
 Yes. 
 That's the word my father used. 
 Is it? 
 Did he put you up to this? 
 No. 
 Not exactly. 
 He's worried about me so he sends a girl to cheer me up. 
 I'm not a girl. 
 I am, but I'm not just a girl. 
 A police driver doing as she's told. 
 No. 
 I can't believe my father. 
 Treating me like a child. 
 What gives you the right to play with me like I need cheering up? 
 That's not fair. 
 "You've no idea how proud we are of you." 
 Well, you don't have to be proud of us, Sam. 
 Because it's bloody. 
 And it's horrible. 
 We're only doing it for the same reason as everyone else. We have to. 
 The simple fact is I want to be left on my own. 
 If Dad thinks he can use you like a nanny, he can forget it. 
 That's not how it is. 
 That's a horrid thing to say. 
 Let me pay for tea. 
 Forgive me if I don't join you but, as I said, I'm not hungry. 
 I'll make my own way home. 
 Mrs Powell. I wonder if I might have a word with you. 
 Yes, Mr Vaudrey. 
 Well, it's about the rations. 
 I don't like to complain but... 
 ..lunch today... We are doing what we can, Mr Vaudrey. 
 I'm beginning to wonder if some guests aren't benefitting at the expense of others. 
 I can assure you that all the food is scrupulously portioned. 
 Well, I have some experience of administration and I have to question that. 
 All I can say, Mr Vaudrey, is if you don't like it here, you can leave. 
 Now, if you will excuse me. 
 Voila. 
 Well, chin-chin. 
 Cheers. 
 Have you thought any more about my proposition? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, we don't want to leave it too late. 
 Who's to say how much longer the war will go on? 
 Could be years. 
 Could be weeks. 
 Take my word for it, Max... there are weaving mills all over the country going under. 
 We buy them cheap, keep them ticking over... end of the war we'll make a fortune. 
 I need to think a bit more. 
 Fine, think all you like. 
 But textiles are my business. 
 Your finance, my expertise. 
 Nothing could stop us. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 I had to see you. 
 No. 
 I had to. 
 I can't just... work out there, pretending - 
 This is wrong. 
 You want me to leave? 
 No. 
 Someone saw us together. 
 Who? 
 Daniel Parker. 
 He saw us and he tried to threaten me. 
 I can deal with him. 
 How? 
 I don't know, I'll - 
 How did I get myself into this? 
 I've made things more difficult for you, haven't I? 
 I should never have come here. 
 No, I can't bear to lose you. 
 I can't bear being so close to you and having to pretend. 
 Wendy. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Nobody. 
 I thought I heard someone. 
 No-one. 
 I'm just preparing dinner. 
 Come on, Charlie. 
 Ten minutes before supper. 
 Go on. 
 Charlie! 
 'The child had terrible burns. 
 The building that had been his home was still burning behind him. 
 I held his hand. The doctor....' 
 Terrible burns... 
 ..terrible injuries... 
 ..dreadful injuries... 
 Charlie! 
 Charlie! 
 Where are you? 
 [ BARKS ] 
 [ SNIFFS ] 
 Charlie. 
 Charlie! 
 A body's been found near Brookfield Court. 
 Farley? 
 A bullet in the back. 
 You should see Mrs Farley, prepare her for the worst. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Yeah. 
 I know you, don't I? 
 We have met. 
 Collier. Inspector...Scotland Yard? 
 Chief Inspector now. 
 Erm...Sergeant Milner. 
 How do you do? 
 How do you do, sir? 
 A bad moment, I'm afraid. 
 We're just about to leave. 
 I'm afraid not, Mr Foyle. 
 I'm suspending you from duty, pending investigation under Section 39A of the Defence and Regulations Act. 
 It's "causing disaffection or influencing public opinion". 
 What are you talking about? 
 Well, I... 
 Can we erm... 
 Can we not discuss this in private? 
 You can say what you've got to say here. 
 You were in London two days ago. 
 Yes. 
 The offence took place at an air raid shelter on Whitechapel Road. 
 Nowhere near the Whitechapel Road. 
 Sir, this is ridiculous. 
 Yeah, can't this wait? 
 No, Mr Foyle, I'm afraid it can't. 
 This is rubbish. 
 You know it and I know it. 
 I was in London on police business. 
 I was not in any air-raid shelter. 
 Suggesting I'd do anything against Defence regulations is ridiculous. 
 I want to believe you but there are witness descriptions and statements. 
 Can I see them? 
 If I'd had my way we'd have done all this quietly. 
 A quick investigation, in and out, clear you and be done with it. 
 But the Assistant Commissioner insisted. 
 Rose, is it? Took over from Summers? 
 Yes. He's on secondment to the Ministry of Home Security and he wants this done by the book. 
 Yeah, I bet. 
 Confined to Hastings and there's to be no communication between you and this station until the investigation's completed. 
 There's a dead man and about £500 worth of stolen food out there. 
 What do you suggest I do about that? 
 Well, I'm sure that your sergeant is perfectly capable. 
 And I know it's a little unorthodox but I persuaded Rose to let me stand in for the next few days. 
 So...what's his name...Milner can report directly to me. 
 A few days? 
 As long as it takes. 
 They can't really arrest Mr Foyle, can they? 
 They're suspending him from duty while they investigate. 
 Spreading sedition in London? I've never heard anything so ridiculous. 
 What exactly is sedition? 
 A single shot to the back. 
 I didn't know it was just a boy. 
 I warned him. 
 I said I was going to fire but he didn't listen. 
 Has his mother identified him? 
 Yes, sir. 
 19 years of age. 
 What am I going to tell his father? 
 All over Europe, young men laying down their lives. 
 This war. 
 Matthew gets himself shot in the back for stealing. 
 Daniel Parker put him up to this. 
 Matthew was a good boy. 
 You talk to Parker. 
 He's the one what ruined my boy. 
 Len : Dan? 
 He's not here. He's at work. 
 Not in any trouble, is he? 
 Can you tell me anything about a friend of his, Matthew Farley? 
 Matthew? 
 Yes, I met him a couple of times. 
 Dan's got a room here and Matthew used to come round now and then. 
 A quiet lad. Never said very much. 
 I'm interested in why you're talking about him in the past tense. 
 Because it's been a couple of weeks since I last saw him. 
 That's the past, isn't it? 
 Why? Are you saying something's happened to him? 
 He's been shot. 
 That's bad luck. 
 You must do deliveries. 
 Is that your bike outside? 
 Yes. Yes, it is. 
 You don't have a van? 
 I do have a van. 
 What I don't have is petrol. 
 Dan Parker's at work, you say? 
 Brookfield Court. 
 He left about an hour ago. 
 Thank you. 
 Daniel Parker? 
 That's me. 
 Sergeant Milner, Hastings Police. 
 I was here a couple of days ago. 
 I wanted to speak to you. 
 Here I am. You can speak to me now. 
 You know Matthew Farley? 
 Uh-huh. I haven't seen him in a while though, how is he? 
 He's dead. 
 Is he? 
 You don't seem very upset. 
 A lot of people are dying these days, you get used to it. 
 Why haven't you been called up? 
 Flat feet. How about you? 
 When was the last time you saw Matthew? 
 A couple of weeks ago. 
 That's not what his mother says. 
 Then you should speak to his mother. 
 I'm talking to you, Parker. 
 We'll find out where you hid the food you stole and who you were with. 
 You'll end up in jail doing hard labour. 
 It was a Ministry of Food warehouse you broke into so we might even be able to get you hanged. 
 Think about it. 
 [ GULLS CRY ] 
 Dad, what are you doing home? 
 Yeah, well... 
 Some imbecile's got the wrong end of the stick. 
 I've been suspended from duty. 
 What are you meant to have done? 
 Seditious behaviour in an air-raid shelter, would you believe? Total rubbish. 
 A couple of officers made a cockup. 
 Are you under house arrest? 
 Not exactly. 
 I saw a constable lurking outside. 
 He's still there, is he? 
 Yeah. 
 So, looks like we'll be stuck here together. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 It's all right. Glad you're here. 
 Oh, really? I heard about your meeting with Sam. 
 Yes...well, if you don't mind my saying, Dad, it was presumptuous of you to set that up. 
 Presumptuous! 
 I asked her to get you out of the house for a change. She drives, I don't. Tea was her idea. 
 I don't need anyone's pity. 
 That's clear. I thought it was very nice of her and now she's upset. 
 I know what you've been through and how you're feeling but it's no excuse for being boorish and totally bloody rude, frankly. 
 What? 
 I didn't mean to upset her. 
 Was she really... 
 Yes, she really was. 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 Maybe I wasn't thinking straight. 
 Well, it wouldn't be the first time. 
 It's a very thorough report, Sergeant Milner. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I think we should arrest Holmes and Parker. 
 I'm not sure you've got enough evidence. 
 The bullet that killed Farley was from a gun the Home Guard carry. 
 We believe he shouted out, "Dan!" when he was shot. 
 Dan, as in Dan Parker? 
 Yes. 
 It could have been, "Damn!" 
 It could have been an oath. 
 Sorry, Sergeant, it's very intuitive. 
 I don't think it's enough. 
 Right, it's late. 
 I'm going back to my hotel... 
 Care for a drink? 
 Yes. 
 
 
 
 It's so quiet down here. 
 (CHUCKLES) Very different. 
 To London? 
 Well, the Germans come night after night and there are whole areas... 
 ..you wouldn't believe the damage. 
 They targeted the docks, but they've also hit the Zoo, Tower of London, Madame Tussauds... and we had bits of waxwork all over Baker Street. 
 The BBC a couple of times. 
 Last week it was the Natural History Museum. 
 You never know what's going to be next. 
 But I'll tell you the interesting thing, doesn't matter what they throw at us, people are still up for work the next morning. 
 Climbing over the rubble if need be. 
 Do you have family in London, sir? 
 No. 
 You were in the army? 
 Yes. Norway. 
 You know, I sometimes think the worst thing about this war is that it's never going to be over. 
 Even when the fighting stops, people won't be the same. 
 How can we go through all this killing and destruction and not come out of it different? 
 How can we pretend we haven't changed? 
 This is very kind of you, sir. 
 No, I appreciate your joining me. 
 I'm well aware this situation can't be easy for you. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 You don't believe Mr Foyle is guilty, do you, sir? 
 I don't want to believe it, of course not. 
 He wouldn't say anything out of line. 
 Your loyalty does you credit but you can't know because you weren't there. 
 I know him. 
 War does different things to different people. 
 Now...tell me about Brookfield Court. 
 Sir? 
 The body was found more or less in the grounds, it's near the depot where the food was stolen, Dan Parker works there and you inquired after a guest. 
 A London county councillor, Frank Vaudrey. 
 Yes, one of the other guests was suspicious about him. 
 Well, that... 
 It seems to me, Brookfield Court should be right at the heart of your investigation. 
 Why don't we pay it a visit tomorrow? Take a look around. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Good. 
 Vaudrey! 
 Have you been in my room? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm talking about a gold cigarette case I left on my dresser and it's not there now. 
 Blake, darling! 
 You were the last to breakfast. 
 You should be careful what you say. 
 Cufflinks, money and now the cigarette case, mm? 
 This only started after you arrived. 
 Mr Hardiman, I know what sort of man you are and what business you and Mr Joseph are in. 
 And I know about your little game too. 
 What do you mean? 
 I suppose you called the police. 
 What? 
 Maybe I should talk to them first. 
 Maybe I will. 
 When did you decide to turn your home into a guesthouse, Mrs Powell? 
 About two months ago. 
 Just after Dunkirk, Mr Collier. 
 I read that other country homes had been put to such use. 
 Funk holes. 
 It was a financial necessity. 
 It's not something we'd have chosen. 
 Was it just you and your husband here? 
 We have a son. 
 In the Forces? 
 In North Africa. 
 He wasn't conscripted, he joined up. 
 We're very proud of him. 
 I understand you have six guests here at present. 
 A Mr and Mrs Joseph, Mr and Mrs Hardiman, Miss Reece and Mr Vaudrey. 
 Vaudrey's the most recent? 
 He's been here a couple of weeks. 
 Who buys the food for the house? 
 I do. 
 You go into the village, presumably. 
 There's a grocer's shop run by a man called Leonard Holmes. 
 Is that right, Mrs Powell? 
 Yes. I have all the guests' ration cards. We pool the supplies. 
 Do you ever buy under the counter? 
 Certainly not! 
 That's an outrageous suggestion, Mr Collier. 
 Unlawful trading's rife in London. 
 I don't see why it should be any different here. 
 I've never been offered or bought anything under the counter, as you put it, Chief Inspector. 
 But you are more than welcome to search the house if you wish. 
 Thank you, Mrs Powell. 
 It's exactly what I intend to do. 
 You have no right to do this. 
 Right, I want to speak to your superior officer. 
 It's horse meat for Mrs Hardiman's dog. 
 It's sprayed green to show it's not fit for human consumption. 
 Where's the writer woman, Miss Reece? 
 She may be in the summerhouse, it's where she works. 
 You are...? 
 Vaudrey. 
 Frank Vaudrey. Look, why are you searching the house? 
 We're looking for misappropriated food, Mr Vaudrey. 
 Do you know anything about that? 
 Certainly not. 
 I believe that you're the most recent arrival here. 
 From London. 
 Yes. 
 London address? 
 13 Goddard Road. The City. 
 Do you have your ration books? 
 No, I gave them to Mrs Powell. 
 How long do you plan to stay here? 
 I haven't decided. 
 That's very good. 
 Thank you. 
 Sir! 
 Can you explain how these came to be concealed in your bedroom? 
 They weren't concealed. 
 They were just in the cupboard. 
 They're Charlie's. 
 Your dog? 
 Yes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're feeding ham - tinned ham - to your dog? 
 Where did you get it? 
 We brought it down from London. 
 You're lying. 
 I think you bought it from Leonard Holmes. 
 How dare you! 
 I'm doing my job and you're obstructing me. 
 Maybe I should arrest you. 
 Maybe I will. 
 Did you find anything else? 
 No, sir. 
 Well, look again. 
 Sir. 
 Has he found anything yet? 
 I don't think so. 
 Not how Mr Foyle would have done it. 
 Sam! 
 Anything upstairs, sir? 
 No. 
 Nothing. 
 Bad luck, sir. 
 It seems the whole thing's been a bit of a disaster. 
 Is that what you think, Miss... 
 Stewart. 
 Stewart, that's it. Yes. 
 That's what you think. Well... you are probably right. 
 Why are you wearing that uniform? 
 This one, sir? 
 You've got it. 
 Well, I'm part of the MTC. 
 Mechanised Transport Corps. 
 Oh, so you're not a police driver. 
 No, not exactly. 
 I was transferred to drive Mr Foyle. 
 It's highly irregular, isn't it? 
 Well, it is the war, sir. 
 So...where were you before then? 
 I was posted in Hastings. 
 Had a frightful area officer. 
 Name of Bradley. 
 Hmm. 
 Quite honestly, I was pleased to get out. 
 I'm afraid I'm going to send you back again. 
 What? 
 It's nothing personal, Miss Stewart, but you see, I don't need a driver. 
 Certainly not one from outside the police force. 
 I'm relieving you of your duties as of now. 
 You can drive us back to the station, of course... and then I'll arrange for your return to the MTC. 
 That's all. 
 I can't say I was expecting to see you again, Stewart! 
 I wasn't expecting to be back, ma'am. 
 I didn't give you permission to speak. 
 You always were a loose cannon, Stewart. 
 I can't say I was sorry when you were transferred. 
 In fact, you were the most insubordinate woman under my command and I can't imagine that your brief sojourn with the police will have made much difference. 
 So, they've decided they can get along without you. 
 I'm sure this is temporary, ma'am. 
 The officer I was in charge of driving has - 
 I'm your commanding officer now. 
 This time I'll be the one who decides who stays and who leaves. 
 I hope, at least, you haven't forgotten your basic training. 
 I'm sure I haven't forgotten all of it, ma'am. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Mr Collier. 
 Mind if I come in? 
 I do, rather. 
 Then...perhaps you'd like to come out. 
 Because...? 
 I thought we should talk. 
 I'm trying to be pleasant, Mr Foyle. 
 The doorman remembers you leaving at seven, an hour before the air raid. 
 The doorman's wrong. 
 He clearly identified you. 
 He's either mistaken or he's making a false statement. 
 You're suggesting somebody's got it in for you? 
 It crossed my mind. 
 Rose? 
 I wouldn't describe Rose and myself as close, exactly. 
 He's a friend of Summers and Summers was sacked because of me. 
 It wasn't Rose who came to me. 
 I went to Rose. I started all this. 
 Thanks very much (!) 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 I had the witness statements. 
 A man of your description talking about the end of the war, German victory, all the rest of it. 
 You know it wasn't me. 
 I don't know it, but I want to believe it. 
 Give me time. I'm doing what I can. 
 Let me look at the case notes. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 I seem to remember you have a son. 
 RAF. 
 Yes. 
 Susannah and I never had children. 
 She was always sorry about it. 
 I'm glad. Too many children being killed in this war. 
 He's erm...he's a bomber pilot, isn't he? 
 Spitfire. 
 I sometimes wonder how they can do it, these German pilots. 
 They're so young. 
 And they come here, they fly over London, they press a button, kill so many people indiscriminately. 
 What kind of a world are we coming to? 
 Are you trying to tell me something? 
 If it WAS you in that shelter, if you did speak out against it, I understand. I'm with you. 
 Well, thank you, but I didn't. 
 Ugh! 
 Urgh! 
 Sam. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Oh, hello. 
 I looked for you at the station. 
 Sergeant Milner said you were here. 
 Yes. 
 A sort of sideways promotion. 
 What do you want? 
 I want to apologise. 
 I behaved badly last time we met. 
 That's all right. 
 No, it isn't. 
 You were very kind to me and... 
 I behaved like an absolute pig. 
 A pig or a prig? 
 Well...both. 
 How did you end up in this dump? 
 It's a long story. 
 I don't suppose I could make it up to you, could I? A flick tonight? 
 They're showing Gone With The Wind. 
 You've probably already seen it. 
 Actually, I never did. 
 What time do you finish here? 
 I've no idea. Presumably when here finishes with me. 
 Well, how about the six o'clock showing? 
 All right. 
 Thanks, Sam. 
 What is it you're not telling me? 
 What? 
 You think just because I can't see I don't know when you're lying to me. 
 Malcolm, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 The other day when I came into the kitchen you said no-one was there but there was. 
 I could sense it. 
 I don't know. I don't remember. 
 Parker, maybe. 
 Not Parker! 
 Parker smells like a rat. 
 Someone else. 
 I sit here and I wait for you and sometimes I think if you ever left me, if you ever went away, that's all I would ever do. 
 Sit...and wait. 
 I'd never do anything to hurt you. 
 Then why don't you tell me? 
 [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] 
 Hailsham 2378. 
 Good morning. 
 Will you hold on a moment, please? 
 Mr Vaudrey, there's a telephone call for you. 
 For me? 
 Yes. 
 Who is it? 
 They didn't say. 
 This is Frank Vaudrey speaking. 
 Milner : "I was on duty when the bombs fell. 
 I felt the whole street rise and fall with the shrapnel dancing off the cobbles. 
 'Come on, Amanda,' Eliza said and without another thought we were off, stirring the ambulance through the swirling smoke." 
 You claim to be an ambulance driver in London but you're not even anywhere near. 
 I don't claim to be anything, Sergeant Milner, You're missing the point. 
 I'm only reading what you wrote in the summerhouse at Brookfield Court. 
 And you smell the whiff of hypocrisy. 
 Please, spare me your blushes. I'm giving my readers what they want - heroism and self-sacrifice during the worst of the Blitz. 
 It doesn't mean I have to experience it, any more than Victor Hugo had to climb up and ring the bells of Notre Dame or Agatha Christie has to go out and commit murder. 
 How long have you been there? 
 Two miserable months and I'm beginning to think I prefer the Blitz. 
 We're investigating the discovery of a body. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, I'd love to write about it but I can't, because officially I'm not here. 
 I'm in London. 
 There is a certain irony in that, I suppose. 
 Hoisted by my own petard. 
 And what could you tell me about Brookfield Court? 
 What could you want to know? 
 Well, we believe the death may be connected to the theft of food. 
 Ah! 
 Misappropriated food. 
 If I were you I'd start with Mrs Powell - a decidedly untrustworthy person. 
 What makes you say that? 
 Well, what do you call a woman with an invalided husband - a blind husband - who is conducting an affair with a man half her age under his very nose? 
 Charlie. 
 Daniel, have you seen Mrs Hardiman's dog? 
 He's not in here, Mrs Powell. 
 Obviously not. 
 He slipped out this morning and she's in a terrible state. 
 I've been in here. 
 I haven't seen him. 
 Charlie! 
 You haven't seen him, Mrs Powell? 
 No. Have you tried the summerhouse? 
 No. He wouldn't go down there on his own. 
 I'll have a look. 
 Come on, Charlie! 
 The wife. 
 Do you know, she worries more about that hound than she does about me. 
 Seriously. 
 I've been meaning to ask you, actually... 
 Mr Vaudrey. 
 Mr Vaudrey! 
 What's happened? 
 Woolton. 
 What? 
 W-W-Woolton... should've...stopped them. 
 Mr Vaudrey. 
 Would you wait a moment, please? 
 Sir. 
 Just put him down for a moment, will you? 
 What do you think happened here, Milner? 
 I say he was poisoned, sir. 
 Was poisoned or took poison - let's not jump to any conclusions. 
 Cyanide, perhaps. 
 Smell of almonds and discoloration of the lips. 
 It looks as if someone's hit him. 
 It is possible. 
 Thank you, gentlemen. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Or he's sitting there, he takes pills or something and then he pitches forward and hits his head on the ground. 
 It's unusual to find a suicide without a note. 
 We haven't looked yet, have we? 
 I thought he must be ill. 
 He seemed to have fallen. 
 Quite. 
 I'm sure this must be very distressing for you, Mrs Powell, but we do need to know... if he was able to say anything. 
 He did speak, yes. 
 And...? 
 "Woolton... should've stopped them." 
 That's all he said. 
 Woolton? 
 Lord Woolton? 
 Yes. 
 That's er... 
 Well, that would make sense. 
 A theft of food in the area, the house is being searched. 
 Vaudrey must have been involved in some way. 
 But why mention Lord Woolton? 
 He's Food Minister. 
 Yes, I know that, sir, but - 
 He'd only been here two weeks. 
 He never spoke to anyone. 
 He sat in the hall building his damn card houses. 
 I didn't think he was involved in anything. 
 He certainly was very solitary. 
 There was one thing. 
 He took a telephone call. 
 When was that? 
 This morning. 
 I was very surprised. 
 Nobody had called him before. 
 Who took the call? 
 I did. 
 It was a man's voice. 
 I can't tell you anything else. 
 He asked for Vaudrey, I gave him the receiver. 
 I don't know what they said. 
 Miss Reece uses the summerhouse, how often is she there? 
 Most days. 
 Sometimes most of the day. 
 Did Vaudrey ever go there? 
 I don't think so. 
 What are you getting at, Milner? 
 Well, sir, if he committed suicide, why did he choose the summerhouse? 
 We suspect that Mr Vaudrey may have taken cyanide. 
 Cyanide? 
 Does that mean something to you? 
 I think you better speak to Mr Hardiman. 
 It's gone. 
 The pill was... 
 It was a suicide pill. 
 We heard this rumour that erm... 
 Well, Harold Nicholson at the MOI and his wife have them in case of German invasion. 
 So I had one too. 
 And it was in a box, was it, or...? 
 Oh, absolutely. 
 Danger. Poison. 
 Skull and crossbones. 
 I don't see how anyone could have taken it accidentally. 
 It may not have been taken accidentally. 
 It might have been stolen. 
 Who knew about the pill, sir? 
 Nobody. I didn't tell anybody. 
 Well, Mrs Powell. 
 Yes, I... 
 I might have mentioned it to Mrs Powell. 
 We've had lots of thefts. 
 Blake lost... 
 My cuff links - 
 ..a cigarette case and money. 
 While you've been staying here? 
 It happened when Vaudrey arrived. 
 We had quite a set-to about it, didn't we? 
 I mean, that's why I spoke to you. 
 Mrs Hardiman, do you realise we may now be investigating a murder? 
 Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about the tins we found, here in your room? 
 Yes. I'm very sorry, Sergeant Milner, I'm afraid I lied to you. 
 But nobody cares about the animals in this war. 
 Thousands of dogs have been put down since it began. 
 There are mass graves - 
 80,000 dead animals buried in secret and thousands more have been left to starve. 
 They've made it illegal now to give milk to dogs and tinned food is even harder to find than real meat. 
 Who did you buy your dog food from, Mrs Hardiman? 
 He left them near the summerhouse - that's why with Mr Vaudrey I have to tell you. 
 Who? 
 Leonard Holmes. 
 Mrs Hardiman has admitted that you've been providing her with a wide range of illegal food supplies. 
 A few tins of ham? 
 I was helping her! 
 At three times the price? 
 She came to me. 
 You make me sick. 
 Physically sick. 
 Have you any idea what's happening out there? 
 People are hurt, people are dying. 
 People are losing everything that matters to them. 
 And a rat, like you... 
 All you can think about is profit. 
 It was just for a dog. 
 It doesn't make any difference! 
 Where did you get it? 
 And where's the rest of it? 
 Milner : This is your last chance, Parker! 
 You were involved in the break-in at Hailsham. 
 Says who? 
 Vaudrey knew about you and Holmes and now he's dead. 
 That's nothing to do with it. 
 Really? 
 We don't know that. 
 Did you kill him? 
 No! 
 Two people are dead. 
 Frank Vaudrey and Matthew Farley. 
 If that isn't enough, we found these in your room. 
 Now, I think it's about time you talked. 
 I did enjoy it. 
 You cried through the second half. 
 I know. 
 My make-up must look dreadful. 
 You look fine. 
 Did you bring the car? 
 Oh...I'm sorry. 
 I wonder why Mr Collier would do that to me. 
 Just because he didn't need me and just because I criticised him. 
 Mrs Bradley's a dragon of the worst sort. 
 Your father better come and rescue me soon, that's all I can say. 
 I'll walk you home. 
 Poor Dad. 
 He hates being stuck at home. 
 What about you, how's the arm? 
 It feels better already. 
 It'll be a few days before I can fly again, though. 
 It's a good thing, isn't it? 
 Yes, I suppose. 
 Aren't you frightened? 
 Sometimes. 
 Maybe my luck's running out. 
 I've had two close shaves now. 
 Last time I really thought it was all over. 
 It must have been horrible. 
 I think about things I'll miss out on. 
 Getting married, having children, Dad's cooking. 
 Your father worries about you. 
 He'd never say as much but I can tell. 
 It was bad enough for him losing Mum. 
 How old were you when she died? 
 Eight. 
 He never talks about her. 
 I think they were very happy. 
 He misses her. 
 So do I. 
 It's a bloody awful world, isn't it, Sam? 
 Hitler, the Nazis. 
 Sometimes I wonder if this will ever end. 
 You shouldn't talk like this, it'll spoil the evening. 
 You're right. 
 What did Scarlett O'Hara say? 
 "Tomorrow's another day." 
 You'll get through it all right. 
 I know you will. 
 I hope so. 
 Anyway, I've really enjoyed this evening. 
 Me too. 
 Thanks for inviting me. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 Sam... 
 Yes. 
 Would you mind if I kissed you? 
 No. 
 Milner! 
 I hope you don't mind me calling, sir. 
 Of course not. Have you been seen? 
 Yes, I think so. 
 You're in big trouble with Collier then. Come in. 
 Good to see you. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 How are you? 
 Well, how do you think? 
 Sit down. 
 No, I won't stay, thank you, sir. 
 I wanted you to know that I got a full confession out of Daniel Parker and we recovered the food supplies. 
 Good. 
 Leonard Holmes was selling them to a network of customers. 
 Anyone willing to pay over the odds. 
 The only customer he had at Brookfield Court was Mrs Hardiman. 
 Not Vaudrey? 
 No, sir. He wasn't buying food. 
 But he might have known something about it. 
 One thing puzzles me. 
 His last words were, "Woolton...should've stopped them." 
 Lord Woolton, Minister of Food. 
 Yes. 
 Odd. Local crime, nothing to do with politics as far as we can see. 
 Sure it wasn't suicide? 
 Well, he definitely took poison but there are three inconsistencies. 
 Did he leave a note? 
 Four inconsistencies. 
 We don't know how he found out about Hardiman's pills. 
 Apart from Mrs Powell, nobody else knew. 
 The medical officer can't be sure that the bruising to the face happened when he fell. 
 But most importantly, if Vaudrey committed suicide or even if he was murdered, why the summerhouse? 
 Everybody knew Amanda Reece worked there. 
 Where was Vaudrey before he came here? 
 He lived at Goddard Road, near St Paul's in London. 
 Right. 
 One last thing, sir. 
 I thought you might like these. 
 I happened upon Collier's case notes about you. 
 I copied as much as I could. 
 Do you know, there are going to be two of us suspended at this rate? 
 I'll be happy to join you, sir. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll let myself out. 
 If the writer wasn't writing away in the summerhouse, where was she? 
 She was with me, sir, at the station. I was interviewing her. 
 Rules her out, then. 
 There you are. My cheque. 
 Thank you, Miss Reece. 
 I'm sorry you've decided to leave us. 
 I'm afraid I'm not, Mrs Powell. 
 I can't work here with all this disruption. 
 A hotel in Shropshire has a room available. 
 I'm sure it will be quieter there. 
 I hope so. 
 You know... if I may say so, there is an atmosphere in this house. 
 I noticed it the moment I came here. 
 You may be right, Miss Reece, but it's not the house. 
 It's the people in it. 
 Still there? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How are we going to do this? 
 Why do you have to go to London, anyway? 
 I'll tell you later. 
 Um... 
 Use my room. Out the window, down the tree and into the next garden. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 How do you think I bunked off instead of doing homework? 
 But you were how old? 
 Aren't you up to it? 
 I see. 
 Your room. 
 You went to see DCS Foyle. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Even though I forbade him to have any contact with this station or vice versa. 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 Are you? 
 I have to say, Milner, I'm disappointed by your lack of faith. 
 I assume you kept him informed of progress at Brookfield Court. 
 Yes, sir. 
 And you must realise I have the authority to strip you of your rank and recommend your immediate transfer. 
 No, you've er... 
 You've really disappointed me. 
 Now, I admire loyalty but for the moment I'm your commanding officer and I might have expected a little of that loyalty to rub off on me. 
 Do you think I've treated Mr Foyle unfairly? 
 I don't think he should have been suspended from duty. 
 It wasn't my decision. 
 That was the Assistant Commissioner and if I reported you, you'd be out of here by the end of the week. 
 As it is, I'm the one who's leaving. 
 Are the charges against Mr Foyle being dropped? 
 No. The investigation's going to continue in London. 
 What about the murder at Brookfield Court? 
 There was no murder. 
 Vaudrey took his own life. 
 I think I can leave it to you to find out why. 
 [ EXPLOSIONS ECHO ] 
 'Madness.' 
 'It's madness.' 
 'He's talking sedition.' 
 [ CHATTER ] 
 Excuse me, Mrs Simms? 
 That's me. 
 Can I have a word? 
 I don't know you, do I? 
 No, I'm a police officer. 
 Oh. 
 Dolly? Can you take over for me? 
 Right you are. 
 You're not local, are you? 
 No, I'm not. 
 I can tell. 
 I understand erm... you were in erm... erm...a shelter. 
 Oh, not that again. 
 Look, I've already told your lot everything I know. 
 I thought that would be the end of it. 
 He didn't mean anything by it, poor old sod. 
 After what he'd been through, it's not surprising. Leave him alone. 
 So you knew him? 
 We all know each other round here. 
 And his name is...erm... 
 Fowler. 
 Colin Fowler. 
 Fowler. 
 Not...Foyle? 
 No. 
 You're not going to bother him any more, are you? 
 What did you mean? 
 What had he been through? 
 In the school. 
 Over in West Ham. 
 It's the authorities, they don't know what they're doing. 
 They didn't know what to expect. 
 They tell me nearly half the houses in Stepney have been damaged or destroyed. 
 What are they going to do with all those people? 
 Public Assistance Committees - they're useless! 
 There aren't enough feeding stations, it's all a mess. 
 What about the school? 
 We were put in there - me, my wife, my two boys. 
 There was hundreds of us in there. 
 Too many. 
 They said it would only be for a while, till the coaches arrived. 
 Three nights we were there. 
 No blankets, nowhere to wash, nowhere to sit down. 
 Do you know what they had for toilets? 
 Buckets and coal scuttles and there weren't even enough of them. 
 They kept us penned in there like animals. 
 Coaches never did turn up but Jerry did. 
 On the third night we were bombed. 
 And the next day, the... 
 Bodies everywhere. 
 I've never seen so many bodies. 
 I never found my wife... 
 ..but I found my two sons. 
 They were lying together, holding hands. 
 It turns out we'd been forgotten. 
 Somebody mislaid the paperwork, I don't know. 
 And now I'm on my own. 
 Not going to lock me up, then? 
 No. I don't think you'll be troubled any more, Mr Fowler. 
 It doesn't make any difference to me. Not any more. 
 There's Bevin up again. 
 Bloody useless! 
 They all are. 
 Rose : I'd no idea you were coming here, Foyle. 
 I don't like having you barge into my office unannounced. 
 If I'd told you, you wouldn't have seen me. 
 You're still under investigation. 
 Well, it's not me you should be investigating. 
 Someone's decided erm...to mistake me for a Colin Fowler, the person you should be looking into, because they've decided our names are similar and he's a policeman. 
 Colin Fowler? 
 All we have in common is our initials. 
 He spent a year in the Police Auxiliary Messenger Service. 
 He's a joiner by trade. 
 And he's no more guilty than I am. 
 Have you seen the man? 
 Yes. Which idiot suspended me? 
 Actually, the decision was mine. 
 Well, what a surprise (!) 
 And Collier? 
 Out of respect for you he handled it personally. What is all this? 
 You're not the only fish in the sea. 
 There are other things on my desk. 
 There's a murder inquiry on mine. I want to know why I was taken off it. 
 Murder? 
 Collier said he committed suicide. 
 Collier's wrong. 
 You're here to complain about him? 
 No. 
 I'm here for information regarding a West Ham school that was bombed two months ago. 
 Mrs Powell, when I interviewed Miss Reece, she made allegations about you. 
 Yes. 
 She said you were involved with your gardener. 
 She said I was having an affair? 
 Those were the words she used, yes. 
 That's a lie. 
 I don't believe it. 
 I don't believe it either but I do believe your wife may have been deceiving you. 
 Is there anything you'd like to say? 
 No. 
 I've nothing to say. 
 Peter? 
 Is that you? 
 Yes, Dad. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Why? 
 How did you find out? 
 Well, he knows nothing about gardening, for a start. 
 You said he was serving overseas, yet there isn't a single photograph of him anywhere. 
 Plenty of you and your husband. 
 I hid them in case someone saw him and recognised him. 
 Wendy...you... 
 ..knew about this? 
 I couldn't tell you, I knew you'd send him back. 
 No, it wasn't Mum's fault. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I deserted. 
 I left my unit before we were due to embark for overseas. 
 The first she knew was when I arrived here. 
 You deserted? 
 I'd had enough. 
 I couldn't take it any more. 
 You don't understand. 
 Of course I understand. 
 You didn't want to end up like me. 
 What are you going to do? 
 Going absent without leave and deserting are treated differently. 
 If your son returns to his unit and gives himself up voluntarily, he'll be treated more leniently. 
 He'll be there. I promise you. 
 Peter. 
 Sorry. 
 You won't get into any trouble, will you - bunking off and meeting me? 
 I couldn't be in any more trouble than I already am. 
 Mrs Bradley's got me fixing her car. 
 An old beast of a thing. 
 Mrs Bradley or the car? 
 I don't know for how much longer I can stick it. 
 Maybe I should pack it all in and move back home to Dad. 
 Don't do that. 
 I'm sure my father will work things out. 
 You know he was in London? 
 He sneaked out. 
 Climbed a tree. 
 I don't think I've ever seen anything so bizarre. 
 Dad in his best suit and hat, swinging down into next door's garden. 
 Did he find anything out? 
 He didn't say. 
 He never does. 
 God, I love it here. 
 How could I ever leave here, with the English sky so blue? 
 Could I turn from the trees as they bend in the breeze, or forsake the evening dew? 
 That's nice. 
 I just made it up. 
 A poet. 
 Killing time in the dispersal hut. 
 You're going back, aren't you? 
 It seems they can't manage without me. 
 You can't fly. 
 The arm's healing. 
 Maybe I should break the other one. 
 Just keep your spanner away from me, all right! 
 I'm going to worry about you now...the whole time! 
 You said I would come through all right. You were sure of it. 
 That was before. 
 I didn't think you liked me. 
 I can see it now - 
 I'll be the one sitting at home, listening to the wireless, writing you letters every day. 
 I'll probably go grey. 
 Sam, we're not going to be far away. 
 I hate this stupid war. 
 I wish Hitler would just... drown! 
 There is something I wanted to say. 
 About your father. 
 Well, you know how he is. 
 He likes to keep everything in separate boxes. 
 I'm sure he'd pack me off to Lyminster the moment he found out. 
 You will take care of yourself, won't you? 
 Promise me. 
 I promise. 
 Morning, Milner. 
 Sir, good morning. 
 Where's Sam? 
 Transferred, sir. 
 Collier sent her back to the MTC. 
 Right. Telephone Andrew, would you, get him over here. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Morning. 
 Morning, Mr Foyle. 
 I imagine you'd like your desk back. 
 Well, there's er...no rush. 
 The Assistant Commissioner telephoned me this morning. 
 I just want to say I'm delighted the allegations proved to be groundless and I'm going to be reviewing this whole business when I get back. 
 That's kind of you. Thank you. 
 I was just finishing my case notes on Frank Vaudrey. 
 And er...what's the conclusion? 
 He was implicated in the illegal distribution of food supplies... 
 Quite why he killed himself is still a matter of conjecture. 
 I mean...I've made some suggestions which... 
 I'm sure you'll follow up. 
 But er...we may never know. 
 Sure it was suicide? 
 Oh, I think so, yes. 
 I'm not. 
 Well, I'm aware that Sergeant Milner's been keeping you informed but er...even so, I'd be surprised you could come to any conclusion without even visiting Brookfield Court. 
 I came to whatever conclusions were necessary in London. 
 London? 
 Where all this sort of...erm began with the request that Milner put in to Scotland Yard for information about Vaudrey because a hotel guest was suspicious about him pilfering, which turned out to be Daniel Parker though Milner didn't know that at the time. 
 His request went up to Scotland Yard where, I think, it was you who came across it. 
 That's right. I did. 
 Vaudrey not being the most common of names, you, not unreasonably, concluded it was the same Frank Vaudrey you were looking for. 
 And why would I be looking for him? 
 Because he was the London councillor who left 200 homeless people sheltering in a school with inadequate provisions. 
 He failed to get them to safety and as a result, more than 100 of them died in an air raid, which er...destroyed the building. 
 Among the dead were two voluntary workers from the WVS - 
 Rosemary and Susan Collier. 
 Who were your... 
 Mother and sister. 
 So, you knew where he was. 
 You knew exactly what you wanted to do to him. 
 Colin Fowler you knew was another of the victims of the bombing. 
 He lost his wife and two sons. 
 You erm... very effectively used the tenuous similarity of our names and a suggestion that he'd been in the police to accuse me of sedition. 
 And in the huge distraction that you created, you took my place, you walked into Brookfield Court. 
 You found the suicide pill as you searched the Hardimans' bathroom. 
 You arranged for Milner to interview Amanda Reece at the station to be sure no-one was in the summerhouse. 
 I don't really need to go on, do I? 
 Not really. 
 I came down here to kill Vaudrey. 
 It's exactly what I did. 
 Vaudrey : It wasn't my fault! 
 You don't understand. 
 It was all so muddled. 
 All the paperwork, the regional committee, the wardens, the ARP - 
 It was your responsibility. 
 I didn't mean to leave them there. 
 It was the pressure of work. 
 You let them die. 
 And then you just left. 
 You dumped your work and you slithered away and you came down here to hide. 
 I'm not well. 
 My nerves are shot to pieces. 
 I don't sleep. 
 You don't know how I feel. 
 How you feel? 
 My mother and sister were in that school. They're dead. 
 And you want me to worry about how you feel? 
 Look... 
 I said I'm sorry. 
 I said I'm sorry! 
 I'm sorry! 
 What more do you want me to do? 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 That's what we're here for, isn't it? 
 I'll tell you what I want you to do. 
 It's a cyanide pill. 
 What? 
 I want you to kill yourself. 
 Swallow the pill or I'll shoot you. 
 No. You wouldn't. 
 Now, I'm offering you a choice, Mr Vaudrey. 
 You can take the pill and go quietly... 
 ..or I'll shoot you in the legs and the arms and the stomach and you'll lie here and writhe in pain you cannot imagine. 
 Believe me, I'm a police officer, I've seen it. 
 I'll sit here and watch you die in agony or you can go to sleep. 
 [ COCKS GUN ] 
 Which is it to be? 
 He took the poison, of course. 
 But er...it didn't kill him as quickly as I'd hoped. 
 It was amazing he was alive when they found him. 
 Mr Vaudrey. 
 What's happened? 
 W-Woolton... should've...stopped them. 
 Woolton. 
 Do you know what he meant? 
 Fowler called a barrage balloon in London Bevin - Minister of Labour. 
 It seems London has named barrage balloons after politicians. 
 It may be of some comfort to you that he died expressing remorse. 
 Woolton was the name of the barrage balloon near the school. 
 It should've prevented the bombing, forcing the Germans to fly higher. 
 It didn't. 
 My mother, my sister... 
 All the others. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. Terrible tragedy. 
 But no justification for the course of action you've taken. 
 I have no regrets at all, Mr Foyle. 
 I lost my entire family. 
 So stupidly. So unnecessarily. 
 And all because one man forgot to sign a piece of paper. 
 That's what I've said from the start. 
 War does different things to different people. 
 Look what it's done to me. 
 Ready yet, Stewart? 
 It'll be a few minutes yet, ma'am. 
 I need it now. 
 Sam! 
 Good morning, sir. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Gross dereliction of duty. 
 It wasn't my idea, sir. 
 I know. 
 You don't want to be here. 
 Certainly not. 
 I've got a car outside needs a driver. You're being transferred. 
 Stewart! 
 Where the devil is she going?
