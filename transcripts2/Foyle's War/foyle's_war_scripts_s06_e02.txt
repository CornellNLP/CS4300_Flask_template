 'Ere you are. Good luck, mate. 
 Hello, old girl. 
 [ BUBBLING ] 
 (WOMAN LAUGHING OUTSIDE) 
 Rose? 
 Man : Ah, Daniel! 
 One moment. 
 Daniel! Daniel! 
 Schau, meine Hande sind leer. 
 Schau, was ich gefunden hab'. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, Danny... 
 Fred... 
 (GERMAN ACCENT) Good morning. 
 Who the hell is he? 
 (CHILDREN CHANTING) 
 Oh! (CHUCKLES) 
 Thank you. 
 Radio : 'This is the BBC Home Service...' 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Doctor. 
 Has my star pupil time for a game? 
 Not now, I'm afraid. This evening, perhaps? 
 I look forward to it. 
 You always present a firm challenge. 
 Unlike some. 
 Have I missed anything? My wireless is broken. I didn't hear the news. 
 I wasn't listening. I try to avoid a daily dose of death and destruction with my morning coffee. 
 Well, it'll be all over soon. 
 I'm afraid there are horrors still to come. 
 (SINGING IN GERMAN) 
 What is this? 
 They've just arrived. They'll be on their way to the prisoner-of-war camp. 
 Who's that man, Mummy? 
 Come on, Daniel - go to your father. 
 Daniel! 
 He doesn't know you yet. 
 He'll come round. 
 He takes after you. 
 Does he? 
 I can't see much Dawson in him. 
 You should have let me know you were coming, sent me a telegram. 
 I thought you'd think the worst when the telegram boy knocked on the door. 
 I wanted it to be a surprise. 
 What's the Nazi doing here? 
 Oh, he's not like that. 
 After your dad died, there was no-one to do the labouring, so they sent Johann from the camp. 
 He's good with Danny. 
 Is he, now? 
 Fred, I'm glad you're home. 
 I'm going to take a kip. 
 Which bed do you want me to use? 
 What? 
 I'm dog-tired. That's all. 
 What's wrong with your leg? 
 So, what do you reckon for Saturday, Miss Stewart? 
 Portsmouth or Charlton Athletic? 
 Do you think I give two hoots? 
 Sorry? 
 I thought the war had put a stop to football. All the endless chitchat. 
 Not any more. It's the War Cup on Saturday and I'm doing the Unity Pools. 
 So, what do you say? Draw or away win? 
 [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] 
 Sgt Brooke. 
 Morning, Sam. 
 Morning. 
 Oh, hold on. 
 I'll put you onto DS Milner. 
 It's the Met. 
 'Ere, while you're on, what sort of team do you think Charlton'll put out on Saturday? 
 Bartram'll play? 
 Sam! 
 Rose! 
 Hello, little man! 
 What is it? 
 Hello? 
 Fred's home. 
 No! 
 Morning. 
 Morning, sir. 
 Yes. And how old is the lad? 
 Rose has wonderful news, Brookie. 
 Her husband's come home. 
 Oh, good for him. 
 After five years. 
 He's been a POW since Dunkirk. 
 He managed to escape. 
 And...is he all right? 
 He's fine. 
 I wondered if I could borrow a dress. 
 His name's Tommy Crooks. He's 15. 
 He works for the Post Office in London, delivering telegrams, but he's been missing for three days. 
 Apparently, he had a row with his father and didn't come home the next day. 
 'What makes them think we can help?' 
 'Well, it's a bit of a long shot, but he used to be an evacuee down here.' 
 Excuse me. 
 Yes, young man? Can I help you? 
 Yeah, I'm looking for Sir John and Lady Muriel. 
 They don't live here any more. 
 Don't they? 
 The house is a psychiatric clinic now. 
 A what? 
 For soldiers and airmen who are...sick a little in the head. 
 Sir John and Lady Muriel are staying at Dial Cottage, over that hill. 
 Oh, I know. Thank you. 
 Don't mention it. 
 Man : Get out of my seat! 
 Peter! Stop that! 
 Come away. Peter, Peter, leave him. 
 Leave him. Stop, now. Peter! 
 Peter, leave him. Leave him. Leave him. 
 Many things will aid your eventual recovery. 
 But you will not truly recover until you say what is going on in your mind. 
 When I close my eyes, I see...I hear... 
 What do you hear, Peter? Who do you see? 
 What am I going to do? 
 I will give you something to make you sleep. 
 Now, that scene just now - you attacked a fellow patient. 
 Why? 
 He annoys me. That's all. 
 Peter, this is not good. 
 Violence never achieves anything. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 That's a good one, Doctor. Where have you been these last five years? 
 How many people in the world have been killed, while we've been sitting here, having this cosy little chat? 
 Ah, here comes your charming wife. 
 Hello, Dr Novak. 
 Hello, Peter. 
 There's more smoke in here than London in the Blitz! 
 What on earth were you doing? 
 The Times crossword. 
 Eight-down was especially ticklish. 
 That is more or less our entire meat ration for the week, you hopeless creature. 
 We can get more from the farm. 
 Johnny, we can't! 
 When are you going to understand? 
 Everything is controlled. 
 Rose is very kind, giving us the occasional egg. 
 I'm not having any more eggs. 
 I'm constipated enough, as it is. 
 Well, it'll have to be turnip on toast. I've nothing else. 
 [ CLATTERING ] 
 God in heaven! 
 What have we done to deserve this? 
 Hello? Hello! 
 Look, Mama - it's the boy. 
 Tommy? What are you doing here? 
 Oh, you look just like Veronica Lake! He'll love you in that. 
 Do you think? Thanks. 
 Are you going out? 
 No, I'm cooking for him. 
 He's got so thin, Sam. 
 I'll put Danny to bed early and then we can just eat and talk, like we used to. 
 I'm so happy for you, Rose. 
 I don't suppose you've got any lipstick. 
 Not since my Yank chap deserted me for that French girl. 
 I swear by beetroot juice, myself. 
 Have you got any beetroot? 
 Erm...about six acres. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I'm scared, Sam. 
 All this time we've been apart - 
 I don't know if we'll get on. 
 If Dan'll take to him. 
 If he still loves me. 
 Johann : Come, my friend. 
 How is your husband, Rose? 
 Very tired. 
 Perhaps he has a bad time in prison camp. Worse than for me. 
 Perhaps. 
 Johann... 
 I will not trouble him. 
 I will get on with work and keep quiet. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, Daniel. 
 Dr Novak : 'His mental state is becoming increasingly fragile. 
 I'm concerned for him.' 
 The fracas outside. He was quite out of control, I understand. 
 I'm not familiar with this case. 
 What happened to this man? Phelps, is it? 
 He's with Bomber Command. Some months ago his plane crash-landed. 
 The crew were all burnt to death - except for him. 
 Lucky man. 
 The plane was part of a raid over Germany which caused a fire-storm which lasted for two days. 
 Thousands were killed, and Peter was a bomb-aimer, by the way. 
 He did his job well, then. 
 But a sensitive young man, with a troubled childhood. 
 When he was nine, his twin brother died in a house-fire. 
 Fascinating case. 
 The guilt of the survivor, three times over. 
 It would be interesting to talk to him - with your permission, of course, Novak... 
 But I won't have the time now. 
 Yes, we must congratulate our colleague on a promotion. 
 Dr Worth has just been appointed to a prestigious position at Cambridge. 
 Do we need to do anything drastic about Phelps? 
 Is he a danger to himself or anyone else? 
 I don't believe so, but I will keep a close eye on him, of course. 
 [ TYPEWRITER TAPPING ] 
 It's very important that he is watched at all times. 
 Very well, Doctor. 
 Joy, are you all right? 
 It's Peter. 
 He's getting worse, not better. 
 Now, listen to me. He is my patient, under my care and protection, and I am determined to help him back to health and a normal, happy life, with you beside him. 
 Well, it worked. 
 Apparently. 
 God help Cambridge. 
 You've caused more trouble in six months than a nest of vipers. 
 You must be happy, then. 
 I will be when you've fulfilled your side of the bargain. 
 All in good time, Dr Campbell. 
 Now, look here... 
 Ready? Let's get you back to the Hotel Hitler, then. 
 You are leaving us so soon? 
 The university want me to start as soon as possible. 
 My congratulations. 
 I'm sorry to see you go. 
 No, you're not. 
 Oh, by the way, those case notes you borrowed some months ago... 
 You never returned them. 
 Oh, yes. Erm...quite interesting. 
 I'll dig them out. 
 You'll never guess what I made for pud. Peach cobbler! 
 Nice. 
 It's so strange seeing you sitting there. 
 We used to talk about you. 
 Me and Danny. 
 Where you were. What you were doing. 
 What was it like, Fred? 
 Tell me. 
 Leave it, Rose. 
 If you can't talk to your wife... 
 (VOMITING) 
 The food's too rich. I'm not used to it. 
 Sorry. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 [ DANCE BAND ON RADIO ] 
 Well, that's... 
 ..quite ruthless. 
 I was taught by my uncle, who was as ruthless with me as with a Grand Master. 
 He was champion of Poland, by the way, until the Nazis declared chess an Aryan pursuit, and Jews were banned from competition. 
 And of course, that was just the beginning. 
 Now, that is excellent. 
 You are coming along tremendously. 
 Chess is splendid - don't you think? 
 Along with the cinema. It keeps me sane. 
 Not your work? 
 The opposite. 
 The enormity of trying to mend so many lives. 
 All those broken souls, Mr Foyle. 
 In the months we've known each other, played these games, you've never once asked about my history, my family. 
 Well, I didn't feel I could, without it being an intrusion. 
 It is I who must intrude on you. 
 My wife is a musician, a pianist. 
 Chopin. I can't listen to him any more - the associations. 
 We have a daughter. Marianka. 
 She will be 14 in a few days, by the way. 
 We lived in the old family home in Lublin. 
 In September '39 Herr Hitler took the opportunity of my absence at a symposium in Paris to invade my country. 
 I couldn't get back. 
 Does that make me a lucky man, Mr Foyle? 
 In June '41, my family was forcibly taken from our home and placed in the ghetto. 
 That much I know. 18 months later I believe they were sent to a place called Majdanek. 
 The rest is silence. 
 And so I fear it will remain. 
 Always hope, wouldn't you say? 
 You think so? 
 We shall see. 
 Pupils...should win occasionally - don't you think? 
 I'll kill him! 
 I'll kill him! 
 Excuse me. 
 (SHRIEKS) 
 Sorry, sorry. Oh, Fred! 
 Frostbite. They don't reckon I'll walk properly again. 
 Let me see. 
 No. 
 I can't. 
 I'll...sleep in the spare room. 
 (HUMMING) 
 Dr Worth? (GASPS) 
 Requisitioned by the Army a few months ago. 
 They needed more space for the work they were doing here. 
 I was planning on coming here today to talk to the owners. 
 The missing boy, Tommy Crooks - this is where he was evacuated. 
 Now it looks like I'm going to be tied up all day. 
 I know the owners. Sir John and Lady Muriel. Friends of my uncle. 
 I could have a word. 
 All right. 
 Letter-opener. 
 Not premeditated. The killer used what was to hand. 
 I wonder if they found what they were looking for. 
 Are these all his? 
 Yes, sir. Dr Worth was about to leave. 
 A new job. 
 Shall we make our own search, sir? 
 In case the killer didn't find what he was looking for. 
 Yeah, and we can take him away. 
 And nobody in this room for the time being.

 (SWITCHES OFF RADIO) 
 Whoa there! 
 I was enjoying that! 
 What's wrong? 
 Somebody's coming. 
 [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] 
 He was a young man in a hurry. 
 Well qualified and even better connected. 
 I'm sure he would have gone far, if er... 
 Were you sorry to see him go? 
 With our patient numbers, I'd be sorry to lose any member of my staff. 
 You didn't like him? 
 What's happened - it's a terrible thing. 
 But Dr Worth wasn't a person I warmed to. 
 Ambition's one thing. Arrogance another. 
 Did he have any enemies here? 
 I can't say. He wasn't the most popular member of staff, but nothing to justify a knife in the chest. 
 He's got an article in here - is that right? 
 Yes, and a fine piece of work, I must admit. 
 I'm sure it was instrumental in getting him his new job. 
 Is that right? 
 What about your patients? 
 Could one of them have got in here? 
 This isn't an asylum, Sergeant. 
 We don't lock our patients up. 
 They may have their difficulties, but they're neither mad nor bad. 
 Fred. Are you all right? 
 Did you sleep well? 
 Take a while, I reckon. 
 Along with some other things. 
 Sorry about last night. 
 You found your work-clothes, then? 
 You look so small in them. 
 I thought I'd go out. 
 Walk the bounds. 
 Get a feel for the old place. 
 That's nice. 
 (WHISTLES) Billy! 
 (BARKING) 
 Are you managing all right on your own? 
 Dear girl, we're not completely hopeless! 
 In a way, it's enjoyable being without staff. 
 One feels one is doing one's bit. 
 Indeed. So, you do remember the boy? 
 What? 
 Tommy Crooks. 
 Oh, he came at the start, Samantha, with two other lads, but they didn't last. 
 Hopeless. One of them was light-fingered. The other wet the bed. 
 Tommy was a nice boy. 
 Polite, willing. 
 Knew nothing when he first arrived. 
 He simply loved mucking out the animals. 
 Thought a sheep was a goat! (LAUGHS) 
 What do they teach them at school? 
 Yes. And he went back to London earlier this year? 
 Didn't want to. Felt at home, see. 
 We were sorry. 
 We became fond of him. 
 Run off, you say? 
 Are you sure you haven't seen him? 
 Here? Why should he come here? 
 Well, if he was happy, and he might have... 
 Well, look around...if you don't believe us. 
 No, that's quite all right, Sir John. 
 I'm sure he'll turn up. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 Come in. 
 [ STRING QUARTET ON RADIO ] 
 Excuse me. Do you have a moment? 
 Mr Foyle. I'm sorry... 
 (LOWERS VOLUME) 
 Er...how are you? 
 Well, I'm very well. How are you? 
 Oh, I'm well enough. 
 Of course, it's...it's dreadful, by the way. 
 Isn't it? 
 This is Dr Worth's article. 
 I was wondering what there is in it that upset you so very much last night. 
 He used case notes about my patients. 
 Confidential observations about their state of mind and treatment. 
 I loaned them to him, in good faith. 
 Mm-hm. I see. 
 Cos you remember what you said? 
 (CHUCKLES) I was very angry. 
 It was a bad thing he did. 
 A breach of professional trust. 
 Some might call it theft. 
 Oh, you think I would kill a man for that? 
 Well...I really don't know. 
 Mr Foyle, I'm dealing with an urgent matter. 
 One of my patients. It won't take long. 
 If you could bear with me. Five minutes. I'll come and find you. 
 Of course.

 It's all right, my dear. 
 Somebody help him! Please! 
 Peter : No! No! 
 Now, now, now. Shhh. 
 (CRYING) 
 Inside. Inside. 
 What's happening here? 
 A patient's being transferred. 
 A routine matter. 
 My secretary, Joy Phelps. 
 Peter's her husband. 
 Can you excuse us? 
 Of course. Whose patient is he? 
 Dr Novak's. I'm surprised he isn't here to see him off. 
 Dr Novak's gone, sir. I saw him on his bicycle. 
 He looked white as a sheet, actually. 
 A bit odd, sir. 
 Moving a patient, today of all days. 
 I think we should ask him.

 We need to get in here, don't we? 
 Yes, sir. 
 [ BANGING ON DOOR ] 
 Dr Novak? 
 Rose! 
 I brought your dinner. 
 I can't let you eat in the kitchen any more. I'm sorry. Fred... 
 Please, no. 
 You have been so good to me. 
 What are you playing at? 
 I just brought Johann some dinner. 
 You're not... 
 Fred, please. 
 Don't you realise how his lot treated me for five years? 
 The muck they fed us? 
 You don't know the half. 
 He's not stopped all day. 
 And you give him egg and chips and all the trimmings. I wonder what else! 
 What do you mean? 
 Here. You can have the bread. 
 (GROANS) Could you not just let me go? 
 Why have you done this? 
 It was what he said. Werth... 
 What's that? 
 Werth. What he said. 
 Man : I want to see my son. 
 And I tell you he's not here. 
 Don't give me that. I know he is. 
 Where else would he go, eh? 
 Now, listen to me, my man. It would be better for you if you left now. 
 I'm not your man, and you can't tell me where to go. 
 What is it, darling? Who are you? 
 Oh, this fella... 
 You know who I am. 
 I've been down here a few times... 
 You're the father of the Crooks boy. 
 That's right. 
 And I've come to take him home, where he belongs. 
 It's loaded. 
 What are you doing, you potty old fool? 
 Defending my property. 
 Now, get out of here. 
 You're finished, you and your kind. 
 You wait till the war's over! 
 You won't be running this country no more. You mark my words. 
 Oh, don't be absurd! 
 [ COCK CROWING ] 
 Excuse me. May I come in? 
 I wish to speak with you. 
 What do you want? 
 You are angry with me, because of my country, and what happened to you there. 
 Say what you have to say and go. 
 It does not matter for me. 
 But for Rose, to make her so unhappy, it is not so good. 
 Don't you tell me... 
 You are home again. 
 I know nothing of my family - if they are alive or dead. 
 You are a lucky man. 
 To have a beautiful wife and such a fine son. 
 I wish... 
 I went to the war, like you. 
 Gave up my life. Lost my friends. 
 Saw bad things. Got locked up. 
 You see, we are not so different. 
 Just soldiers. 
 What a failure. 
 I could not even kill myself. 
 I'm surprised they let you home. 
 No sympathy for civilians, foreigners and would-be suicides. 
 And they needed the bed for more-deserving cases. 
 Look, at some point I'm going to have to ask for your help. 
 Do you feel all right now, or shall I come back? 
 What would you like to know? 
 I'd like to know why you had Peter Phelps moved. 
 I was unable to help him. 
 Another failure. 
 Was he your patient? 
 Yes. 
 And where did you move him to? 
 I had him committed to a mental asylum. 
 Impossible to overlook that you chose to move him within hours of Dr Worth's death. 
 Coincidence. It does happen. 
 What did Dr Worth say to you? 
 As they were taking you to the hospital, you tried to tell me what he'd said to you. 
 Did I? I can't remember. 
 Of course, it's also impossible to overlook the fact that you've attempted to kill yourself within hours of telling me you were going to kill Dr Worth. 
 Did you? 
 It wasn't that he lied to me, cheated me. 
 Rather, that he used the misery of brave and damaged men to better himself. 
 I'm so tired. 
 The bestiality of violence, and the horror, the horror. 
 I don't want to be part of your brave new world. 
 Aren't you going to arrest me? 
 Not just yet. 
 Then I'd like to go back to work as soon as possible. 
 I can help. 
 This is very good of you. 
 My pleasure. We had a report about a young boy who's run away from home. 
 We think he might be hiding down here somewhere. 
 I was wondering what would make a child do that. 
 Unhappiness at home, perhaps. 
 Or school. 
 Oh, I think he's left school. 
 He delivers telegrams for the Post Office. 
 I suppose that, every day, he delivers one of "those" telegrams. 
 Your missing boy. 
 Telling a mother or a wife their son or husband is dead. 
 The pain he must see... 
 How old is he? 
 15. 
 He was evacuated here at the start of the war. 
 Really? 
 (SIGHS) What a burden. Poor child. 
 He is a messenger of death. 
 You don't think Dr Novak killed Worth, do you, sir? 
 Did I say that? 
 So, shall I go on interviewing Worth's colleagues and patients? 
 Yep. 
 Despite what Dr Novak said? 
 Yeah. You can also speak to Mrs Phelps and find out where they've taken her husband and as much as you can about him. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Dr Novak does seem to be a decent man, sir. 
 Decent men don't kill? 
 Not usually. 
 Well, quite. 
 When Peter had his breakdown and was sent here, I came down to be near him. 
 I had to find a job. 
 Dr Campbell was looking for a secretary, so... 
 Good for everyone. 
 Iain - Dr Campbell - he's been very kind. 
 A draft of the staff newsletter. 
 Perhaps you could tidy it up. 
 I understand that your husband's condition has worsened recently. 
 He's become more...difficult. 
 Short-tempered. 
 I can't seem to reach him, get through to him, let alone help him. 
 Isn't it awful? His own wife. 
 'm sorry. 
 Was your husband ever violent towards you? 
 No, no. 
 Well, at least, only in words. 
 It was Dr Novak's view that Peter was losing control somewhat and it was better that he be cared for in a more appropriate place. 
 An asylum? 
 I agreed. 
 It's not such a bad place. 
 I'll get you the details. 
 You look at the fixtures, tell me what you think the results will be, I'll fill out the coupon in the paper, and Robert's your father's brother. 
 But what's the point? 
 The point, Sam, is: you might win something sizable for your bottom drawer. 
 I haven't got any drawers, bottom or otherwise. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 What have I missed? 
 Nothing, sir. 
 In fact, you're just in time - to hand over a tenner. 
 What's that for? 
 Football pools, sir. 
 Right. That's really where my money should be going? There's a war on. 
 Well, it's nearly over, Mr Foyle. 
 Call it an exercise in staff morale, with the station closing. 
 Right. 
 Leaving? 
 Yeah. 
 How did you get on? 
 I spoke to Mrs Phelps. 
 She's very cut up about her husband being put away. 
 Is this where he is? 
 Yes, sir. But she looked almost guilty about it. 
 I rather got the impression that there might be something between her and Dr Campbell. 
 Ah. How does that help, I wonder? 
 Come on, Milner. Put your hand in your pocket. 
 Oh...did you see all the moths flying out? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Thank you. 
 When you've quite finished...I want to make a complaint. 
 Look, I just want to know he's safe. 
 I know he come running back up here. 
 That's why I went to see the landed gentry. 
 And caused a right old to-do, by the sound of it. 
 He was the one with the shotgun! 
 I want him charged, by the way. 
 Threatening behaviour. 
 What happened, before Tommy ran away? 
 We had words. 
 He was supposed to bring in something for tea, but he forgot, so I had a go at him. 
 He started creating, and...I gave him a wallop. 
 I wish I hadn't, but...I did. 
 I keep thinking he's just away at the market, or in Hastings. 
 He'll be back soon. 
 It wore him out, son - running the place on his own. 
 Got too much for him. 
 And I wasn't here. 
 You were doing your bit. 
 He was proud of you. 
 Nothing to be proud of. 
 Second day in action, they took me. 
 Didn't even get to kill one of the bastards. 
 You come for him, then? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll er...walk back with you. 
 Rose! 
 I made you a rabbit pie. 
 And a plum cake. 
 What is this? 
 I made it for Fred coming home, but it's too big for him now. 
 I want you to have it. 
 Rose... 
 I'll write to the Agricultural Committee. 
 They'll talk to the camp commander and find you another place. 
 Please, look at me. 
 You're sending me away? 
 I don't know what we're going to do, but you can't stay, and that's a fact. 
 Rose, I... 
 Don't. 
 Please. 
 Don't be upset. 
 Everything will be OK. 
 I will miss you. 
 I'll miss you too, Johann. 
 Now, Fred... 
 Oi, you! Get your hands off her! 
 Fred... 
 You bloody Nazi! 
 Don't! 
 Stop this, or I will hurt you! 
 Fred! 
 That's enough, now! Stop it, Fred. 
 Fred, you stop it! 
 That's enough! You - get going. 
 Leave off, Fred! 
 You come back here, and I'll kill you! 
 Inside. I want to talk to you. 
 Let go. You're hurting me! 
 Rose! 
 Leave it. Get walking. 
 Oh, no! He's had you, hasn't he? 
 He's been in my bed and my wife. 
 Don't be disgusting. 
 That's right. You're too weak to take it out on him, so you belt your wife, instead.

 Mr Phelps? 
 Peter? My name is Foyle. 
 Do you remember Dr Worth? 
 (MOANING) 
 Do you know who I mean? 
 (PETER MOANING) 
 What did you see? 
 I saw the blood. 
 I saw the blood. 
 What else did you see? 
 I saw the blood. 
 (MOANING) 
 It's all right. 
 It's all right, Peter. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 You found Sir John and Lady Muriel, then? 
 And now you're catching their supper. 
 If I get lucky. 
 Are you a doctor, then? 
 Yes. 
 How do you make people better... when they've gone a bit barmy? 
 Often people get better just by talking about the things that have upset them. 
 I hate the Jerries. Don't you? 
 Why did you run away, Tommy? 
 This woman in Bethnal Green - 
 I took her a telegram. 
 Found her in the back yard, beating this old rug on the washing line. 
 She looks at it, hands it back and asks me to read it for her. 
 Her husband, he was in the Navy. 
 His ship had been sunk. He... 
 She just starts screaming. 
 Lays into me with the beater, going, "Get away! Get away, you little b*st*rd!" 
 Why did she do that? 
 I don't get it. 
 Why did she do that? 
 Tommy... this lady was out of her mind with sorrow. 
 When people lose their loved... 
 She lashed out at you just because you were there. 
 If she were here now, she would want to hold you and say sorry to you. 
 This...wasn't your fault. 
 No? 
 No. 
 OK. Thanks. 
 Your family will be worried. 
 They should know you are safe. 
 We should tell the police where you are, by the way. 
 I'm not going back to London. 
 I'm staying here. 
 Nothing bad ever happens here.

 [ BELL ] 
 Johann, kommst du mit zum Essen? 
 Nein, ich bin nicht hungrig. 
 (MEN LAUGHING) 
 All right, sir? 
 Listen. It's been quite a day, and I'm going to walk. You go home. 
 Good night, sir. 
 Good night. 
 Mr Foyle! 
 Doctor. 
 Will you join me? 
 It's the new Bing Crosby. 
 Er...not quite my cup of tea, frankly. 
 Ah, sentimental music, Mr Foyle - it always touches me. 
 You're looking better. 
 I did something useful today. 
 Maybe there is a point, after all. 
 Ah, curtain up. I found the boy - 
 Tommy. He's with the Sackvilles. 
 Right. Good night. 
 Oh, Rose. 
 I'm sorry about this. 
 Whatever's the matter? 
 (MEN SHOUTING) 
 Man : Steady! 
 (SHOUTING) 
 You left early. 
 What's going on, Sam? 
 Oh, one of the POWs escaped from the camp. 
 Really? 
 It's Johann, Rose. 
 Johann? Why would he have done that? 
 He got away last night. 
 Are you all right? 
 Listen. I've got to get to work. 
 I'm sorry - I'm already late. 
 Loudspeaker : 'Achtung! Achtung!' 
 Never had a minute's bother with him. 
 Did what he was told. Got on with his work. 
 I wish they were all like him. 
 Why do you think he cleared off? 
 I...don't rightly know. 
 He's not daft enough to try getting back to Germany, is he? 
 Do his bit, now their backs are against the wall? 
 Oh, what's he gonna do? 
 Swim the Channel? 
 Doesn't make sense, does it? 
 Anyway, he's not that kind of lad. 
 No Nazi, you mean? 
 Well, he said he hates soldiering. 
 He's a farm boy. Likes animals. 
 Was he his usual self yesterday afternoon? 
 Nothing out of the ordinary? 
 Just a normal day. 
 Took him to the farm in the morning, brought him back in the evening. 
 And everything was all right? 
 Yeah. I don't understand it. 
 I mean, I think he was happy here. 
 You know? 
 Damn and blast! There's got to be a few here somewhere. 
 Ah! 
 Oh... 
 Are you spying on me, girl? 
 Couldn't Tommy do that for you, Sir John? 
 I know he's here. 
 No, he's not. 
 He was seen. Someone spoke to him not far from here. 
 You misunderstand me. 
 He was here, but he is no longer. 
 I don't understand. 
 He went out fishing. 
 Something for the supper. 
 He never came home. 
 We haven't seen him since. 
 'We're worried about him. Keep hoping he's going to come through the door with a nice, fat trout.' 
 (DOGS BARKING AND MEN SHOUTING) 
 Rose : Johann? 
 Johann? 
 (MEN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) 
 Where's Johann, Mummy? 
 Come on. Let's go down to the lake. 
 See if the ducks are there. 
 Be careful, Daniel. It's dangerous. 
 What's that, Mummy? 
 What? 
 Down there - look. 
 That's him. 
 Sir, there's something on the back of the head. A wound. 
 How's that happened, do you think? 
 Well, he could have fallen. 
 Trying to get away, stumbling along in the dark. 
 Full moon last night, wasn't it? 
 Or he was hit. 
 He is a German, after all. 
 That's enough motive for some. 
 Rose? 
 Go and play, Daniel. 
 Where have you been? 
 I've been worried. 
 (TEARFULLY) Johann's dead. 
 What? 
 In the lake. 
 His head... 
 (MAKING AEROPLANE NOISES) 
 He got out of the camp? 
 Did you see him here? Did he come here last night? 
 No. 
 I don't know. I... 
 (DANIEL SHOUTING) 
 Daniel, will you stop doing that? 
 You'd better pull yourself together. 
 The police'll be here soon. 
 Did you find the boy at the Sackvilles'? 
 Tommy Crooks? No, sir. 
 He didn't come home from a fishing trip. 
 They don't know where he is. 
 I wouldn't normally, but under the circumstances, I feel I ought to tell you. 
 Mrs Dawson spent the night with me last night. 
 She turned up at my doorstep, very upset. 
 She and her husband had an argument about Johann Schultz. 
 I see. 
 So, he left here at the usual time yesterday? 
 Yes. 
 That was the last you saw of him? 
 Because where his body was found suggests that he was either on his way here or... coming back from here. 
 But erm...you couldn't confirm that? 
 No. 
 But I gather you weren't here last night. 
 I stayed with Sam. 
 Any particular reason for that? 
 I had some shopping to do in town. 
 I didn't want to cycle back in the blackout. 
 Hmm. 
 What about you, Mr Dawson? 
 What about me? 
 Were you here last night? 
 Yeah. I was here all night. 
 I had a bit to drink. I fell asleep. 
 I didn't see him. 
 How difficult was it, coming back home, after five years in a prisoner-of-war camp, to find a German working on your farm? 
 Well, he did his job. 
 Impossible not to understand whatever resentment you might have felt, in the circumstances. 
 So, I didn't like him. 
 Not a crime, is it? 
 We're fighting the bastards, for God's sake. 
 But I didn't kill him, if that's what you're thinking. 
 How did YOU get on with him? 
 He was a lovely boy. 
 I'm so sad he's dead. 
 I don't know how I'm going to explain it to my son. He adored him. 
 Joy : To think of him shut away in that place - it's unbearable to me. 
 Dr Campbell : It has to be that way. 
 You know that. 
 Hold me. 
 Kiss me. 
 Chief Superintendent. 
 Excuse me. I should have knocked. 
 I'll come back. 
 Mrs Phelps, I've been to the asylum to see your husband. 
 Have you? 
 How is he? 
 He's in a very bad way. 
 Joy... 
 Mrs Phelps is under great strain. 
 She needs a great deal of support. 
 Yeah, I can see. 
 How's er...Dr Novak, by the way, since he's been back at work? 
 I wanted him to take more time off. 
 I'm concerned about him. 
 What do you make of him claiming responsibility for Dr Worth's death? 
 Josef's a good man. 
 Compassionate, kind. 
 But who knows what men are capable of when pushed to the limit? 
 It may seem a truism, Mr Foyle, but all of mankind's most impenetrable secrets lie inside the head. 
 [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] 
 Disturbing you? 
 You don't look very well. 
 Do you know what is definition of a psychiatrist? 
 A person trained at length and great expense to help other persons go mad. 
 Perhaps I shouldn't be asking for your help, then. 
 In spite of you having seen him, the boy seems to have gone missing again. 
 Odd. Why should he do that? 
 And it seems that...you were the last to see him. 
 How was he? 
 Calm. We had a good talk. There was a distressing incident at work. 
 That's why he ran away. 
 And where did you see him? 
 At the pond, fishing, quite happily. 
 I should also mention that I've been to see Peter Phelps. 
 I've told you who killed that shabby little man, Worth. 
 Yes, well...I'd say you didn't have it in you to kill. 
 I think you're allowing friendship to interfere with the prosecution of your job. 
 It never has before. 
 I'd also say you're ignoring the lessons of recent history. 
 Think of all those men who led such unremarkable lives till '39. 
 We gave them a uniform, a gun and a mandate. 
 Kill, we said. And they have, unblinkingly, in vast numbers. 
 Mr Foyle, I sent off the coupon. 
 Excellent. What coupon's that? 
 From the paper. The football pools. 
 The War Cup. They're playing tomorrow. 
 Wonderful. 
 I must say, I had to laugh when I saw your line. 
 Well, I filled it in solely with your amusement in mind(!) 
 Port Vale have as much chance of getting a draw at Arsenal as I have of winning the Derby on a seaside donkey. 
 Right. 
 My! What system did you use, sir? 
 I used the random system, Sergeant. 
 But you can't do that, sir. 
 No, you have to look at the teams, work out which is better and how, and decide. That's how you win. 
 Well, science was never my strong point. 
 Well, we'll see which comes out on top, shall we, sir? Science or chance. 
 We will. 
 Sir, we've had the MO's report on Johann Schultz. 
 Ah, right. 
 Port Vale - what a lovely name. 
 It sounds such a peaceful place. 
 Where is it, exactly? 
 Somewhere up north. 
 He can't say exactly what caused the head injury. 
 There were fragments of stone in the wound, but whether they're the result of a fall or a blow, he can't say. 
 Mm-hm. 
 But he did find something else. 
 There was no water in his lungs. 
 He didn't drown. 
 He was dead before he went into the lake. 
 Right. 
 Someone killed him? 
 Looks like it, yes. 
 Jesus! That's... 
 I need a smoke. 
 You liked him, didn't you? 
 Bloody hell. 
 What happened between Fred Dawson and Johann yesterday? 
 Nothing happened. 
 He thought there was something going on between Johann and Rose. 
 Yesterday afternoon, it all blew up. 
 Bit of a fight. Nothing much. 
 Fred was no match for Johann. 
 I took him away. 
 Fred and Rose had things to sort out. 
 When Johann escaped, do you think it was to go back to Down End Farm? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe he was worried about Rose. 
 She was...kind to him. 
 Fred - very angry yesterday? 
 A bit. 
 How angry? 
 Look, it's not going to be me that puts the noose round Fred's neck. 
 Just for killing a Jerry. 
 But if he'd done or said anything he perhaps shouldn't have, you'd tell us, wouldn't you? 
 Of course. 
 And you'd tell us because, German or not, whether you liked him or not, this man's been beaten to death and that's wrong. You'd agree? 
 Yes. 
 How angry? 
 He said, if he ever came back to the farm again, he'd kill him. 
 There. I've said it. 
 God forgive me. 
 I'm under arrest? 
 There are questions you need to answer about the death of Johann Schultz. 
 Oh, Fred... 
 Please, if you'll come with us. 
 (DOG BARKING) 
 Oh, Sam... 
 I know. 
 It's going to be all right, Rose. 
 What if he did it? 
 I'm telling you - I never saw him again. 
 I downed half a bottle of Scotch and passed out. I didn't wake till dawn. 
 Well, that's fine, except that nobody can vouch for it - you were on your own. 
 Yes. 
 What can be vouched for is your attack on Mr Schultz... 
 No, that's... 
 ..the reason for your attack... 
 I was angry - I admit that. 
 ..and your threat to kill Mr Schultz if he came back. 
 I didn't mean it! 
 So, on the face of it, it looks to us as if that's what happened. 
 I didn't mean it. It was just one of those things you say! 
 It was just one of those things you say. 
 I didn't kill him. 
 And if he came back, I didn't see him. 
 Sergeant, look after Mr Dawson in there, would you, for a moment? 
 Sir. 
 Radio : 'We now bring you a further dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, Alexander Werth, who was with the Red Army when it liberated the Nazi concentration camp at Majdanek in Eastern Poland.' 
 'Nothing in my experience could have prepared me for the image that greeted us on our arrival earlier today. 
 Row upon row of drab huts, containing horrors that defy imagination, that were nevertheless arranged in front of us like some scene from hell...' 
 I just wondered if there was any news on my lad. 
 He was staying with the old couple, after all, but he's gone. 
 Well, where's he gone? 
 You haven't seen him? 
 No. 
 Well, if he's not with you, and he's not with them... 
 Run off again? 
 I don't know what's wrong with that lad. I mean, I don't know what to say to him. 
 Jeannie would have got through to him. She was good at that. 
 Your wife? She's passed away? 
 Last July. Just after Tommy came home. 
 She was in a baker's on the Commercial Road, getting a loaf for his sandwiches. 
 Doodlebug. 
 Killed everyone in the place. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Tommy was the first one there. 
 You know, what he must have seen, it don't bear thinking about. 
 But he never cried. 
 He always said he didn't want the war to end, so he could join up and get his own back. 
 Revenge, you mean? 
 Oh, yeah. Hates them, he does. 
 I don't know what he'd do if he met a Jerry in the street. 
 We know that Tommy was out and about the day that Schultz escaped. 
 Dr Novak saw him barely half a mile from the lake, so it gives him an opportunity, as well as a motive. 
 And how old is he? 
 He's 15, but he's a big lad for his age. 
 And now he's disappeared. 
 At first I thought it was a coincidence, but now I'm not so sure. 
 Well, the sooner we find him the better. 
 [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] 
 Will you get that? 
 Hello? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, he's here. 
 It's the gentleman from the BBC you were after, sir. 
 Good afternoon. May I speak to the manager, please? 
 Yes, of course. 
 He's gone to the pictures? 
 Yeah, I'm sure there's method in his madness. 
 I wonder what's on. 
 Sir? 
 All right. 
 Sir, how long do you think you're going to be? 
 About an hour. 
 Last look around, before we hand back the keys. 
 Well, I was thinking about Tommy. 
 If I was in trouble, where would I hide? 
 And he lived here for four years. 
 Had the run of the place. 
 He knew it better than anybody. 
 I was wondering: could I take a look? 
 Do. 
 And nobody's been in here - right? 
 No, sir, apart from me and one of our men, when we were doing the search. 
 Find anything? 
 Not really. 
 Ah...you're back. 
 Have you finished in here yet? 
 Almost. 
 Good. 
 We're desperately short of space. 
 Mm-hm. 
 What does "not really" mean? 
 There's a copy of a letter. 
 A reference from Dr Campbell in support of Worth's job application. 
 It doesn't quite tally with what Campbell said about him. 
 Perhaps he was just desperate to get rid of him. 
 Is that it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 We've been through all the packing cases. 
 His desk, the rest of the furniture. 
 Pictures off the walls, rugs off the floor. Up the chimney. 
 The only thing we haven't done is lift the floorboards. 
 Maybe the murderer found what he was looking for, after all. 
 Where do... 
 "..all of mankind's impenetrable secrets" lie, Milner? 
 Sorry, sir? 
 Ah, sir. We've finished with Dr Worth's study. 
 Ah, good. 
 Compliments of DCS Foyle. 
 Thank you. 
 [ DOOR CREAKING ] 
 Hello? 
 Tommy, is that you? 
 [ CLATTERING ] 
 Stay away. 
 Are you all right? 
 Leave me alone. 
 Look, I'm here to help you. 
 Sam? 
 Please, Tommy. 
 No-one's going to hurt you. 
 Why did you run away, Tommy? 
 I'm saying nothing. 
 You met the German, didn't you? 
 By the lake. Were you thinking about what happened to your mum? 
 No! Don't come any closer. 
 Careful. 
 I'll jump! I'm not scared. 
 Looking for this? 
 Tell us what happened, Tommy. 
 I promise you it'll be for the best. 
 We know you didn't kill that man. 
 But you must have seen something. 
 I was trying my luck at the lake. 
 I got nothing in the pond. 
 Go on. 
 Two men - I heard them talking on the path above the lake. 
 Then him - the one who fell - he walked on. 
 But the other man picks something up and he runs after the other bloke and he hit him over the head, like really hard, like this. 
 And then... Did you say his name was Johann? 
 Was he really a Jerry? 
 He was a prisoner of war. 
 See, I never knew that. 
 That he was German. 
 Then what happened? 
 He fell down. 
 The other man bent down to look at him, and he put his head in his hands, like this. 
 Then he rolled him into the lake. 
 Not 20 yards away from where I was standing. 
 Who was it, Tommy? 
 Who killed Johann? 
 "Affair" makes it sound so grubby. 
 And that's not how it was. 
 But Worth was a nasty little sh1t. 
 He said something to me about Joy. 
 A lewd remark. I snapped at him. 
 And he laughed. 
 He knew. 
 And I made the mistake of writing to Joy. 
 An affectionate letter. 
 I put it in the post-tray in the staff sitting room. 
 Worth took it, and he used it. 
 If it ever got out - the wife of a patient - 
 I'd have been ruined. 
 And poor Joy... 
 He forced me to write a glowing reference for his job application. 
 I did it on condition I got the letter back. 
 And he broke his word. 
 He said he'd keep it as insurance. 
 And he smiled. 
 He never should have smiled. 
 Iain... 
 Oh, I'm sorry...Mr Foyle. 
 I must make it clear that Joy knows nothing of this. 
 She thinks her husband killed Worth. 
 What is it? What's... Is everything all right? What's going on? 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Thank you. 
 [ SWING BAND ON RADIO ] 
 Are you ready to order? 
 Could I have a cup of tea, please? 
 You're quiet today, even by your standards. 
 Well, I know I've got to make a better show of this than I did last time. Check. 
 I'm...surprised you have the time, given everything that's on your plate. 
 Glad, of course, but... 
 And I'm also wondering how I'm going to tell you. 
 Tell me what? 
 Well, firstly... 
 ..we now know who killed Dr Worth. 
 And I'm relieved to be able to tell you that it wasn't you. 
 Wasn't it? 
 Though I do now perhaps understand why it is that you tried to take the blame. 
 It was Peter, wasn't it? 
 Well, I'd be very interested to hear why you're so convinced it was. 
 Because when I went to Worth's study that night, Peter was there. 
 'Kneeling over the corpse. Blood on his hands. Completely gone. 
 What was he doing there?' 
 I felt desperate that I hadn't been able to help him, that it was my fault. 
 Of course it was Peter. 
 It was Campbell. 
 But why? I don't understand. 
 Worth was blackmailing him because of his relationship with Peter's wife. 
 But this, none of this - 
 Worth's murder or your belief that Peter was responsible for it - is the reason why you tried to take your own life, is it? 
 And it wasn't until today that I realised that it wasn't even what DOCTOR Worth had said to you... 
 It was what he said. Werth. 
 What's that? 
 ..but what the BBC correspondent, Alexander Werth, had said in his report from Majdanek, first broadcast, according to the BBC, the morning I came to see you in your office, describing the unimaginable horror that had been uncovered there. 
 No, the point is, someone did imagine it and then made it a reality - for my family, amongst countless others. 
 I was wrong to try to take my life. 
 We must carry on, however bleak the future seems, however impossible it is to face it. 
 And I was wrong to take the blame for Worth's death. 
 But when I came to myself in hospital... 
 ..it seemed I had betrayed my murdered family. 
 I was alive and they were dead. 
 It was the guilt of the survivor, and I had to take the blame for something. 
 I had to find a reason for my existence. 
 (TEARFULLY) And if I could help Peter in any way, help give him time to recover... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I had news today. 
 From my contacts in Poland. 
 There were very few survivors in Majdanek, but... 
 ..among them, it seems, my daughter Marianka... 
 It seems she is alive. 
 I'm very pleased to hear it. 
 You have been a good friend to me, Christopher, at a most difficult time in my life. 
 Well, the occasional game of chess, Josef - it's not very much. 
 You listen. You understand. 
 I am so grateful. 
 But I think I have taught you too well. 
 You have beaten me here for the first time! 
 If you'll excuse me, I think I should get back to work. 
 And secondly... 
 How was the film the other night? 
 Bing Crosby? Oh! 
 Silly and sentimental and quite wonderful. 
 The print for that film didn't arrive. 
 They showed Abbott and Costello, instead. 
 They also showed Pathe News. 
 And the report from Majdanek was unbearable. 
 Legs. 
 Sticking in the air, stiff with death. 
 I couldn't watch it all. 
 You couldn't, either, could you? 
 'I left. 
 I don't know where I went. 
 I have no memory of anything.' 
 Until... 
 You met Johann. 
 He came out of nowhere. 
 (GASPS) 
 'I looked up. I saw this face.' 
 Aus dem Weg! 
 'Out of my way.' 
 Dummkopf. 
 'I saw this uniform, and this rage went through me like a fire. 
 I picked up a rock and...' 
 (GROANS) 
 A moment. 
 That's all it took. 
 'But it will define my entire life.' 
 I killed a man. A boy. 
 Perhaps the circumstances... 
 No, they offer no excuse. 
 We are all tainted by this war, in one way or another. 
 But not everyone commits murder. 
 Perhaps hearing him speak German? 
 Perhaps. 
 Or perhaps it was because he was up there... 
 (TEARFULLY) and I was down there in the gutter, where all Jews...belong. 
 I had this evil taste in my mouth. 
 I spat it out. 
 That's all. 
 I became the enemy. 
 It's strange. I am a rational being. 
 I am a scientist. 
 I believe in free will. 
 And yet I cannot escape the fact that the most important events of my life have been dictated by chance. 
 I met my wife on a train I nearly missed. 
 I evaded death at Majdanek because I was at a symposium in Paris. 
 And I killed a man because I like Bing Crosby and you do not. 
 If you had been there... 
 I'm sorry. 
 How did you know? 
 By chance...you were seen. 
 'Who?' 
 'By a troubled boy, to whom you offered help.' 
 Oh. 
 Poor Tommy. 
 Mr Crooks : I wanna see my son. 
 Don't give me that. 
 Lady Muriel : This way, please. 
 Take your boots off, man. 
 They're not dirty. 
 Why can't you leave my Tommy alone? 
 Ain't you got no son of your own? 
 Not any more. 
 He was killed at Dieppe. 
 Right. Are you coming home, then? 
 Dunno. 
 Now, look here, you... 
 Don't shout at me! 
 Look...I know you've been through it. 
 And I wish I could make it better. 
 But words can't do the job, even if I had 'em, which I ain't. 
 I used to feel safe here. 
 Well, you can come and visit the ruling classes in your holidays. 
 You know, if you really want to take up this country life, then do it when the war's finished, eh? 
 Why do you want me to come back? 
 What does it matter to you? 
 Cos you're mine, damn it! 
 Cos I need you. 
 I can't bear that house without your mum. 
 Come home, Tommy, please. 
 Yeah, OK, then, Dad. 
 I wanted to come and meet you. 
 Did you? 
 It's like you're coming home all over again. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you going to be all right? 
 Don't know. 
 But I've got to try, for all our sakes. 
 Especially his. 
 Come on. It's OK. 
 Come to your dad. 
 I'm sorry about everything. 
 I'm sorry about...your friend. 
 Were you and him... 
 Please. 
 I've got to ask, even if it's not what I want to hear. 
 These last 18 months, I couldn't have done without him, and that's the truth. 
 I was fond of him... and he was sweet on me. 
 But the thing is, Fred... 
 I was waiting for you. 
 My sweetheart. 
 I'm hungry. 
 Are you hungry? 
 Let's go home. 
 [ RAUCOUS LAUGHTER ]
