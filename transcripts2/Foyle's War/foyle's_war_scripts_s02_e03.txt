 Morning, sir. 
 Morning. 
 Good morning, Sir Reginald, I was wondering - 
 Not now, Philby. 
 Are they all here, Miss Brown? 
 Yes, Sir Reginald. 
 Simon? He came back from the airport a little while ago, sir. 
 Good. I'll need to see him immediately. 
 He's in his office. 
 Right. Miss Brown, I'd like you to take the minutes of this morning's board meeting. 
 What about Miss Patterson? 
 No. Just you. 
 Yes, Sir Reginald. 
 The minutes of this meeting must be kept to a minimum. 
 An aide memoire to be deposited with our solicitors. 
 I'd be happier to see nothing in writing. 
 There may come a time after the war when we need to demonstrate there was a consensus on our European operations. 
 Which I am sure is the case. 
 I had to think carefully about which board members should be here. 
 Some I felt were not in tune with our thinking. 
 I don't need to remind you that what is said here must go no further - the usual caveats about walls and ears. 
 Now I'll hand you over to my son Simon. 
 Simon returned from Switzerland this morning. Not an easy journey. Simon. 
 I've brought home a letter. 
 Unlike the one Mr Chamberlain brought from Munich this one IS worth the paper it's written on. 
 Put simply, this agreement will make Empire & European Foods the largest processor of non-mineral fats and oils in Europe both during the war and after it. 
 It doesn't even matter who wins. 
 We can't lose. 
 Could I have Hastings 1456, please? 
 This is Agnes. 
 I can't talk, but he came back from Switzerland this morning and it's just like you said. 
 He's brought back a letter. 
 I think I can get it, but we'll have to be quick. Tonight? 
 At eight o'clock. The usual place. 
 [ SCREAM ] 
 Sergeant Milner, you made the arrest? 
 I did. Yes. 
 Can you describe how you found the dead man? 
 He was lying on the floor in the locker room of the pottery where they both worked. 
 There was a belt around his neck. 
 He'd been strangled. 
 Can you tell me very briefly on what grounds you arrested my client? 
 He'd argued violently with the dead man. 
 He'd also threatened him. 
 Rather tenuous evidence I would have said. 
 Can I have the belt, please? 
 This is the belt that was used? 
 Yes. You of course checked it for fingerprints but you found none belonging to...my client. 
 I put it to you, Sergeant Milner, this is not a murder at all. 
 A man climbs onto a chair and hangs himself from a belt. 
 Any belt that he finds in the locker room. 
 He falls, and the chair beneath him topples. 
 He had grazes on his knuckles. 
 The body was in the room for three days before it was found. 
 It attracted rats, I believe. 
 Yes. 
 Could not the rats have been responsible for the grazes? 
 Could they not in fact have been bites? 
 That would have looked different. 
 Are you a qualified medical officer, Sergeant Milner? 
 No. 
 No further questions. 
 'He made a fool out of me.' 
 No. You held your own, and it's not over yet. 
 Good afternoon, sir. 
 Good afternoon. 
 I know he's guilty. 
 I'm sure the jury will agree. 
 I'd like to get the barrister! 
 Here's your chance. 
 Christopher. 
 Stephen. Not lost your touch. 
 I'll take that as a compliment. 
 You two have already met of course. 
 I hope you'll forgive me. 
 Let's wait for the verdict, sir. 
 Oh. Yes. 
 Fishing this weekend, Christopher? 
 There's very little in the shops. 
 Maybe we can get some for ourselves. 
 Certainly. 
 I didn't realise - 
 Sorry I didn't mention it. 
 It wouldn't have helped if I had. 
 Here he comes now. Ask him yourself. 
 Afternoon, Mr Foyle. 
 Hello, Brian. 
 It's paper day. 
 I've forgotten again, haven't I? 
 One envelope makes 50 cartridge bottoms. 
 I do know that, Brian. 
 Do you need this? 
 Hands off, Tim. 
 That's aluminium. 
 We always take that for Spitfires. 
 You take that and what do we do if the station catches fire? 
 We need more salvage because of the prize. There's chocolate. 
 And because of winning the war. 
 Why not come back tomorrow? 
 We could have gathered up more paper by then. 
 After breakfast? Ten o'clock OK? 
 It's a date. 
 Good. 
 Bye, then. That's the second salvage collection I've missed. 
 They think I'm a fifth columnist. 
 Letter came for you, sir. 
 From Brigadier Harcourt, Home Guard Liaison Committee. 
 I've been roped into some sort of exercise. 
 War games? 
 The regular army's involved. 
 A few hundred men taking shots at each other in the woods round Hastings. 
 Are they asking you to join up? 
 No. I'm the referee. 
 Which means I'm not in court tomorrow, Milner. 
 That's all right, sir. 
 I'm sure you'll manage. 
 [ BUZZING ] 
 Lucy. 
 I'm just coming. 
 At least there's honey for breakfast. 
 Another letter from the bank. 
 Just put it with the others. 
 We can't keep ignoring them. 
 There's not much else we can do. 
 They won't bother with us. We're too small for them to worry about. 
 CWAC. 
 What's that? 
 War Agricultural Committee. 
 They're ploughing up the top field. 
 They warned us it would come. 
 What was Dad thinking of? 
 Bloody fool! 
 Come on. It's not as bad as that. 
 There must be easier ways to earn a living. 
 You are not going back to that. 
 No, Lucy, that's not what I meant. 
 Harry, I know what you're thinking. 
 I won't leave. 
 If anything killed Dad it was you in prison. 
 What killed Dad was pneumonia. 
 And he got pneumonia cos he was out cutting kale at six in the morning in the coldest winter we ever had. 
 If we hang around much longer we'll probably join him. 
 We can make a go of it. 
 The object of the exercise is for the Home Guard to hold up the advance of the enemy for as long as possible. 
 The assumption is they'd land at several points on the coast. 
 These points will not be known until the exercise has begun. 
 I shall refer to the enemy as Red. 
 Blue is the Home Guard. 
 On the day we will wear flashes of the appropriate colour. 
 You'll be White, Mr Foyle. 
 Right. 
 Neutral. The enemy will consist of regular troops, so we'll have quite a fight on our hands. 
 Their CO should be here at any moment. 
 When we get the information about the enemy beachheads, are we meant to attack them, sir? 
 No, Philby. No. 
 Our job is to obstruct. 
 Philby will be acting as my second in command. 
 He's also our main liaison with Sir Reginald Walker. 
 Part of the exercise will take place on Sir Reginald's estate. Right. 
 Luckily Philby here knows the man. 
 I'm a director with Empire & European Foods. Right. 
 As I understand it the game starts with only a limited number of enemy soldiers at the beachheads. 
 It's no game. 
 I'll still need a clear understanding of the rules. 
 Troop movements to allow for roads and bridges falling to the enemy. 
 Will it involve the military police? 
 We've spoken to them. Yes. 
 Are you using live ammunition? 
 In a few designated areas, otherwise it'll be blanks. 
 Again the military police will have to patrol the boundaries. 
 We need absolute clarity on that. 
 The maps are drawn, Mr Foyle. 
 I can foresee no problems at all. 
 What I don't want are any unnecessary hold-ups in the movement of Home Guard forces. 
 We can't have civilian traffic clogging us up. 
 If we're trying to create invasion conditions, there's no point in keeping roads clear. 
 In an invasion, roads north of Hastings would have refugees. 
 You'd have to deal with that. 
 You're here as a referee, Mr Foyle. 
 I think you can leave the military planning to me. 
 Oh, right. 
 Ah. Here's the regular army. 
 Not before time, if I may say so. 
 Mr Foyle, this is Captain Devlin. 
 Devlin, how are you? 
 Good to see you again, sir. 
 Yes, and you. 
 You two know each other? 
 We've met. 
 So you're stationed near here? 
 I've been stuck at a desk job since I was shipped back from France. 
 Caught a bit of shrapnel. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 But it took a while to heal. 
 I should be rejoining the chaps any day now. Good. 
 I didn't expect to find you caught up in all this. Nor me. 
 Did they give you a new sergeant? 
 He's a good man. 
 You've probably met. 
 How's Andrew? 
 Very well. Thank you. 
 He's with a squadron on the South Coast. Good. 
 No transfer? I heard a rumour you were to work with General Ismay. 
 No. It didn't work out. 
 You're damn good at your job. 
 If that's the case, what am I still doing here? 
 Well, I'd better get this lot sorted out. 
 Prepare for battle. 
 Right. 
 Markham? 
 Mr Beck. 
 I wonder if I might have a word. 
 Come inside. 
 I can't believe you're asking me to do this. 
 You of all people! 
 You know I've been out of trouble for two months. 
 You've been out of prison for two months. 
 I had something to do with that. 
 I know. I know what I owe you. 
 I wouldn't have come to you if it hadn't been important. 
 Important? 
 Much more than that. 
 I don't know. 
 It just seems mad. 
 I can't believe you're talking to me this way. 
 It's a mad world. 
 We all have to adjust. 
 Why can't you go to the police? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Sir Reginald Walker. 
 You know he's my landlord? 
 Oh, I didn't know. 
 Rented this land to my dad. 
 It was my dad who had the bright idea to switch from arable to dairy. 
 Now you get 45 shillings a quarter guaranteed for wheat, but milk... 
 He died while I was in prison. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Lucy thinks it was my fault. 
 She thinks he died of shame. 
 That's not true. 
 Working here that killed him! 
 Will you do it? 
 There's a safe? 
 A big one. American. 
 They'll know it was me. 
 The crime won't even be reported, my friend. 
 Why not? 
 Trust me. 
 Can I think about it? 
 I have very little time. 
 I'm leaving England quite soon now. 
 Leaving to go where? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Here is my telephone number. 
 You can call me. 
 Sir Reginald Walker is extremely wealthy. 
 He owns this farm and many others. 
 You're paying him to work here, which makes him even wealthier. 
 That is also... 
 ..mad. 
 Call me. 
 I forgot my ration book. 
 Who was that? 
 No-one. 
 Harry, who was that? 
 They were lost. 
 They were asking the way. 
 Simon? 
 Alice. 
 What are you doing? 
 Just checking on the wine. 
 So why do you lock the cellar? 
 We've got some stuff down there worth £20 a bottle. 
 You can never be too careful. 
 Shall we? 
 Ah. 
 There you are, my dear. Drink? 
 Mm. Thank you. 
 Mm. Lovely. Now, Reginald, I want to talk to you about the dining room. 
 Oh, yes? I was thinking of having it redecorated. 
 I feel the wallpaper is rather musty and old-fashioned. 
 We could do with new curtains, too. 
 Shame. Mother loved the dining room. 
 Simon! 
 This is your house now, Alice. 
 And you must have it how you like. 
 I'll get someone in. 
 Don't worry. I'll see to it myself. 
 I know how busy you are. 
 Better wait till these exercises are out of the way. 
 The Home Guard. 
 Pretty ghastly if you ask me - the whole world tramping over the estate. 
 It's only 24 hours. Anyway, Alice, better not leave the house. 
 The groundsmen must stay out of the woods - they may use live ammunition. 
 Whatever you say, dear. 
 We don't want anyone getting shot. 
 [ DOGS BARK ] 
 [ GROWLING ] 
 [ BARKING ] 
 [ WHIMPERING ] 
 [ DOOR CREAKS ] 
 [ TUMBLERS CLICK ] 
 [ DOOR CREAKS ] 
 (Reggie!) 
 (Reggie!) 
 What is it? 
 I think there's someone downstairs. 
 [ DOOR OPENS ] 
 There's a burglar. 
 Right. 
 Stop! Thief! 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 Did you get him? 
 Tickled him. 
 [ HORN BLASTS ] 
 Sir Reginald Walker, isn't he the chairman of Empire & European Foods? 
 That's right. 
 The Home Guard exercises are taking place on his land. 
 The break-in was reported by a warden on his way home. 
 He heard a shot, and saw someone climb over the wall. 
 But Sir Reginald never actually reported the crime. 
 We contacted him. 
 That's unusual. 
 'I didn't like to trouble you.' 
 These are difficult times and the police have enough on their plate. 
 It's not as if anything was taken. 
 Are you quite sure of that, sir? 
 We've looked. There doesn't seem to be anything missing. 
 But he did get into the safe. Right? 
 Yes. The door was open. 
 But I chased him off before he could rifle the contents. 
 Not that he'd have found anything. 
 I only keep business papers in it. 
 Yes. I keep my jewellery upstairs. 
 Is the safe - 
 Yes. It's American. 
 Way ahead of its time. 
 Manipulation-proof. Tumbler lock. 
 Over ten million combinations. 
 I'd say you're looking for a real professional. 
 I'd say you were right, Mr Walker. 
 Any names spring to mind? Any known felons - that sort of thing. 
 Is this the window he came through? 
 Yes. Drugged both the dogs first. 
 And you took a shot at him as he left? 
 My son fired into the air, Mr Foyle. 
 A warning shot. 
 Didn't want to hit anyone. 
 Look, in retrospect I see we should have reported it, but since no-one was hurt and nothing was taken, I don't think we should waste any more time. 
 Right. 
 I've never met anybody quite so cheerful about being burgled. 
 No. And his son said he fired a warning shot. 
 You don't try and warn someone by firing at them. 
 Plus they're already running away. 
 Harry Markham is the only one round here capable of getting into a safe like that. 
 And not taking anything? 
 Yeah. Came out of prison two months ago. Devlin arrested him. 
 It was his last case before he joined up. 
 Markham? Before your time. 
 You wouldn't know him. 
 Go and introduce yourself. 
 I want it back. 
 Of course you want it back, Pa. 
 It's worth a bloody fortune. 
 It's worth more than that. 
 Sometimes I worry about your ability to see the wider canvas. 
 Whoever has it will try to sell it. 
 We have to find it before that. 
 We have to think like this man Foyle. 
 He said it was a professional job so he'll be looking for a professional. 
 We must have friends at the police. 
 What about Cade? 
 He's at Scotland Yard. 
 I'll get onto it. 
 I'm sorry about this, my dear. 
 An unpleasant business. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why didn't you call the police? 
 I didn't need to, did I? 
 They came anyway. 
 Was something taken? 
 Of course not! You don't think I'd lie, do you? Don't worry about it. 
 Just a little unpleasantness. 
 Now, let's have some lunch. 
 I don't understand you. 
 You said that was all behind you. 
 It is. It's not what you think. 
 Where were you last night? 
 I know what I think! 
 Lucy, please! Ah! 
 Are you hurt? 
 I'm fine. 
 Let me see. 
 Don't fuss. Please just - ah! 
 Oh, Harry! What is this? 
 Lucky I was 30 yards away. 
 Sit down. 
 What - I can hardly call for a doctor, can I? 
 Look, it was a favour for a friend. 
 That's all. 
 A favour that went wrong. 
 You broke into a house. 
 I wasn't going to steal anything! 
 I didn't mean to, but... 
 Lucy, supposing I found something that could get us out of here? 
 Give us money. Look for a new life. 
 We have a life here. 
 We don't! 
 You sit down. 
 Harry, look at you! 
 (God!) 
 What is it, this thing you've got? 
 I can't tell you. 
 Where is it? 
 Friends are looking after it. 
 What friends? 
 Busy ones. And I can trust 'em, too. 
 You just talk a load of nonsense, Harry. But you listen to me. 
 You go back to thieving, I'll throw you out of here. 
 Do you hear me? 
 I'm sorry, Lucy. 
 Sorry as you're gonna be. 
 Ah! Ah! 
 Ssh. 
 I hope your Mr Milner has forgiven me. 
 I wouldn't underestimate him if I were you. 
 I haven't, and I didn't. 
 I saw Jack Devlin the other day. 
 Sergeant Devlin? 
 He's a captain now in the Seventh Armoured Division. 
 Yes. I remember him well. 
 An interesting young man. 
 No. They're not feeding, are they? 
 Sometimes I prefer it that way. 
 If the fish bite you have to do something about it. 
 What are you using? 
 Medium olive nymph. 
 Are you reading Skews? 
 The Way Of The Trout With The Fly. 
 My wife bought me that... on our first wedding anniversary. 
 You were still in Germany then, weren't you? Yes. 
 We had to send to London for it. 
 We didn't leave till '35. 
 We saw what was coming. 
 I love this sport, but sometimes I think it is the greatest waste of time anyone ever invented. 
 You know, you're right. Pint? 
 A pint. The fishing. 
 The evening light. 
 There are things about this country I'd always miss if I had to leave. 
 Mr Beck. 
 Not here, Markham. 
 Back stairs. Half an hour. 
 You got it? 
 No. Sorry, Mr Beck. 
 It didn't work out. 
 What happened? 
 I managed to get in some of the way, but they were light sleepers. 
 I heard them coming down the stairs, and I had to get out fast. 
 You got nothing? 
 Didn't have time to open the safe. 
 I am sorry, Mr Beck. 
 I didn't mean to let you down. 
 You're lying to me. 
 No! 
 I've been a barrister for 30 years. 
 You think I don't know a liar when I hear one? 
 I had to get out of there. 
 They shot at me! 
 But you had something. 
 I had nothing. 
 Let me tell you something, my friend. You don't know me. 
 The people I work with. 
 What I am capable of. 
 Honestly, Mr Beck, I'd never do - 
 You were in the study. 
 Yes. 
 You opened the safe. 
 No. 
 What did you take? 
 Nothing. 
 I'll give you a little time. 
 We'll meet again. 
 And if I were you, I would think very carefully. 
 [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] 
 Sir. 
 Yeah. There's been another break-in, I'm afraid. 
 This time we have the culprits. 
 They're outside. 
 Would you mind having a word? 
 So what have you got to say? 
 We were doing our duty. 
 It's what the lady on the wireless told us to do. 
 Lady Belling, sir. WVS. 
 You broke into your school. 
 Is that right? 
 Looking for what? 
 Salvage. 
 Such as? 
 Paper. 
 Saucepans. 
 Or frying pans. 
 Coathangers. 
 Soap boxes. 
 Shoe trees. 
 Vacuum cleaner tubes. 
 They can all be used. 
 The lady said so. 
 A single chop bone can make the cordite for two cartridges. Right. 
 I've heard of children breaking out of school, but breaking in! 
 How did you get in? 
 Over the railings? 
 Someone's already taken them. 
 Now, look, what you do is very commendable, but you can't go breaking into buildings. 
 Want me to lock 'em up, sir? 
 What? 
 Six months hard labour on bread and water? That should teach 'em. 
 Perhaps not this time, Sergeant. 
 But listen, better stick to paper from now on, all right? 
 Leave it to the professionals. 
 Perhaps a new commander to keep you out of trouble. Captain. Sir. 
 You've just been promoted. 
 Keep an eye on them. 
 Right, troops, quick march. 
 Get your hands out of your pockets. 
 Miss Markham? 
 Yes. 
 Sergeant Milner. Hastings Police. 
 I'm looking for your brother. 
 Hastings? 
 You work for Mr Foyle? 
 Yes. 
 Sending you to do his dirty work for him this time, is he? 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 Tell Mr Foyle from me Harry hasn't done anything, and he can just leave him alone. 
 Where is he? 
 He's with his platoon. 
 He's joined up? 
 Home Guard. They've a big exercise. 
 That starts tomorrow. 
 I haven't seen him today. 
 When he comes home would you let him know we'd like to speak to him? 
 Somebody hurt? 
 That was Harry. 
 He just cut his hand on a fence. 
 He's lucky he has you to look after him. 
 I thought I'd find you here. 
 What do you want? 
 Look at this. 
 What is it? 
 The local rag. 
 I see that. What's so important? 
 Read it. 
 You read it. 
 Attempted burglary at Greenwood Hall, home of Sir Reginald and Lady Walker. 
 The thief managed to get into the safe. It was a big one. American. 
 That's Harry. 
 It's gotta be. 
 I thought he'd retired. 
 That's what he told us. 
 Maybe he's decided to go solo. 
 On our patch. 
 Double-crossing b*st*rd! 
 Shall we go round to his place? 
 No need to. We'll see him tomorrow at the war games. 
 We can't do much with that going on. 
 Get him alone in the woods. 
 We'll do plenty. Give me that. 
 Yeah. That's Harry. 
 Thank you, Mr Cade. 
 My father will be very grateful. 
 Yes. I'm sure you can expect to hear from him. 
 Goodbye. 
 Well? 
 He's given me a name. Harry Markham. 
 Markham? 
 There was an Eric Markham I used to know. One of my tenant farmers. 
 Eric's the father. Harry's the son. 
 Just got out of prison. 
 Did three months for breaking and entering. 
 Three months? 
 A very short sentence. 
 The judge must have been impressed with him. 
 How sure are we he's our man? 
 Cade says only half a dozen people could break into a safe like ours, and Markham is local. 
 What are we going to do? 
 Don't rush in. 
 Whatever you do, don't rush in. 
 Pa - 
 Just let me think.

 Please, carry on. 
 Don't mind me. 
 [ ORGAN MUSIC ] 
 Good evening. 
 [ MUSIC STOPS ] 
 German music? 
 The greatest music in the world. 
 Time for you to leave, Mr Beck. 
 So soon? 
 We told you to be ready. 
 I am. 
 When? 
 Three days from now. 
 They could have given me more warning. 
 I'm sure we could rearrange the war to suit your needs. 
 Point taken. 
 But I'm not ready to go. 
 Not quite yet. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I'm in the middle of something. 
 Then you'll have to leave it. 
 I can't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Not now. 
 Are you going to tell me? 
 Are you going to pretend you don't already know? 
 She was 36 years old. Unmarried. 
 You knew her father. He worked here in Hastings. She worked in London. 
 She was a personal secretary at Empire & European Foods. 
 Her name was Agnes Brown. 
 You never disappoint me, Miss Pearce. 
 You feel responsible. 
 Yes. I do. 
 That's the reason I can't oblige you until this business is finished. 
 You know you're disobeying orders? 
 I also know there's not much you can do about it. 
 Be careful, Mr Beck. 
 I'll keep my eyes open for you, Miss Pearce. 
 Left. Left. Left.

 All right, squad. Attention! 
 Right. Now I'm sure you'll all agree salvage collection is just as hard work as Home Guard manoeuvres. 
 It's harder. 
 Absolutely. 
 And that we're just as entitled to buns and lemonade. Fall out. 
 Pass me one. 
 OK. 
 Did you find him? 
 No, sir. 
 But I spoke to his sister Lucy. 
 She asked after you. 
 Oh, did she? 
 Not very flattering, I bet. 
 I was involved in his arrest. 
 I looked at his record. I'm surprised his sentence was so short. 
 Well, Stephen Beck defended him. 
 Almost took the case apart. 
 Almost, but not quite. 
 There was definitely a sympathy vote from the judge. Three months? 
 Mm. Where are we going to find him? 
 Actually, you'll see him later. 
 He's with the Home Guard. 
 Right. And can you let me know if he has a cut on his hand? 
 A cut? 
 Ah, Mr Foyle, sir. 
 Brigadier Harcourt's compliments. 
 He's sent you a driver. 
 Where's Sam? 
 She's gone off with the youngsters. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Devlin. Devlin, this is Milner. 
 Milner, Captain Devlin. 
 I've heard a lot about you. 
 You have my old office I understand. 
 Yes. 
 I miss it. 
 The brigadier suggested I pick you up. I take it you still don't drive. 
 Well, that's right. 
 Good to meet you, er...Milner. 
 Working on anything at the moment, sir? 
 Not very much if the truth be known. 
 A burglary a few days ago at the Walker place. 
 Did they take much? 
 No. They were frightened off. 
 But they managed to drug a couple of dogs and open a pretty sophisticated American safe. 
 Remind you of anybody? 
 Harry Markham. 
 Mm. 
 He's out, isn't he? 
 He is. 
 Why did he only get three months, sir? The judge got it wrong. 
 I couldn't believe it when I heard it. That lawyer of his. 
 Not even English. 
 His lawyer is a friend of mine. 
 Sorry, sir. No disrespect. 
 But he made fools of us. 
 They both did. 
 It could have been worse. 
 Oh? What makes you think? 
 Harry Markham was a nasty piece of work. 
 When you've been lying in a field hospital with your face in bandages, you can't see, you don't know if you'll ever see. 
 People like Markham should be shot. 
 Right. 
 Never mind. Nearly there. 
 Where's the replacement radio? 
 The number 18 set from Ringford platoon. 
 Ah, Philby. Not on your way yet? 
 Just about to leave now, sir. 
 You should be on your way to Chawleigh Camp. I know. 
 By the way, I had a call from the military police. 
 Running out of personnel! 
 They need you to set a couple of men on the lower wood on the Greenwood Estate to keep the public away. 
 We can't have people where there's live ammunition. Right, sir. 
 Oh, Mr Foyle. 
 Mr Walker. 
 I was told you were here so I came to see you. 
 I think I owe you an apology. 
 What for? 
 Father and I were talking. 
 We realise we were wrong not have contacted you about what happened at the hall. 
 Just to say we're certain that nothing was taken. 
 I'm very pleased to hear it. 
 Hello, Philby. 
 Oh. Hello, Simon. 
 How's it going? 
 I'm just about to join my men. 
 Philby! 
 This is temporary headquarters of Home Guard Defending Forces. 
 It should not be open to civilians. 
 Simon Walker. 
 You're on my father's land. 
 This is temporarily my land, Mr Walker. 
 And you are trespassing. 
 Right. 
 (Sorry.) 
 Hello, Harry. 
 Connor. 
 What do you want? 
 What do you think? 
 I don't know. 
 We've been looking for you. 
 You've been avoiding us. 
 Why would I do that? 
 You tell me. 
 I haven't been avoiding you. 
 Been reading about you. 
 What? 
 In the newspaper. 
 Greenwood Hall. Someone broke in there a couple of days ago. 
 I wonder who that could have been. 
 Nothing to do with me. 
 No? 
 Bloody great safe we heard. 
 Drugged the dogs. 
 Put 'em nicely to sleep. Always did have a soft spot, didn't you? 
 If it had been us, the dogs would be dead. 
 Had the police round? 
 They must know it was you. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I'm talking about an agreement the three of us had. Yeah. 
 We work as a team. 
 We weren't a team when I was being sent down. 
 Your tough luck! 
 You're the one who got caught. 
 That's right. I got caught. 
 I went down, and I'm finished with it. 
 I'm not interested any more. 
 That's what you told us, Harry. 
 And we told you that was fine by us. 
 But if you changed your mind - remember? All for one. One for all. 
 That's what we said. 
 I think he's forgotten. 
 Yeah. I do, too. 
 If you have changed your mind, you know what that means. 
 It means it's like the old days. 
 Three-way split. 
 So tell us what you took from Greenwood Hall, and where it's stashed. 
 You've got it all wrong. 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 I never went near the place. 
 You never were a good liar. 
 Oh! Oh! 
 You're with us, or you're against us. It's as simple as that. 
 Get away from me! 
 I don't think you're listening! 
 Argh! 
 Where is it, Harry? 
 What's going on here? 
 Connor, Clarke, what are you doing? 
 Just a small disagreement, sir. 
 Nothing serious. 
 I'm not going to have you scrapping like this. Not in uniform. 
 Get round the front and join the others. 
 I'd watch out if I was you. 
 Can get very lonely in the woods all on your own. 
 Lot of live ammunition around. 
 All right. 
 Gather round. 
 The idea is to set up an observation post behind Chawleigh Camp looking down at the enemy. 
 We see everything they do. 
 The camp is the Red's bridgehead. 
 So when the regulars move out the brigadier knows when they're going and where. Got it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 We're right behind you, sir. 
 We're the eyes and ears. If there is an invasion, it's a vital role. 
 All right, everyone. Form up. 
 Single file. Hand signals only. 
 Not you, Markham. 
 I've got a special assignment. 
 Are you going out? 
 Yes. You said it was safer to stay in the house. 
 Safer for YOU. I thought I might keep an eye on things. 
 It is my land. 
 Would you like me to come? 
 No, no, no. I'll take the dogs. 
 Is there something you're not telling me? What? 
 Ever since Simon got back you've been behaving so strangely. 
 Is it to do with your business? 
 I never discuss my business. 
 You know that. 
 But your business is your life! 
 If you exclude me from that you exclude me from everything. 
 That's nonsense. 
 Were you like this with Joyce? 
 Don't ask me about Joyce. 
 Why not? 
 I know how much she meant to you, and how you felt losing her. 
 I don't think you do. 
 I know you'll never love me the way you loved her. 
 I hate it here. 
 I feel like I'm living in her shadow, and the worst thing is you never talk about her. 
 You and Simon live in your own private world, and no matter what I do I'm not allowed in. 
 Why can't we go back to London? 
 We've got the flat. 
 We were so, so happy there. 
 These are difficult times, Alice. 
 Don't ask questions. Just trust me. 
 Enjoy what we have. 
 I'm going out. 
 Right-ho. 
 Now listen, we've got to get out of those trees onto the ridge. 
 We'll need sniper cover, so Connor and Clarke... 
 Where the hell are they? 
 I suppose they'll catch up. Snell. 
 You can provide cover. Come on. 
 At last! 
 Thought you'd never get here, Mr Philby. What? 
 I don't know whether I'm meant to say 'Bang' or 'Hands up', but consider it said. 
 Now... would you mind taking off your clothes? 
 Still not working? For heaven's sake, man, get on with it! 
 This is completely hopeless. 
 Have to get a message to Divisional HQ. Don't suppose you've any ideas? 
 I don't have ideas, Brigadier. 
 I'm only the referee. 
 How much longer do you propose to keep us here? 
 I am a captain in the Home Guard, and you have no right... 
 First the radio, now this! 
 I don't know what the blue pencil's going on. 
 Come on, Taggart, we can't spend the whole exercise twiddling our thumbs here. 
 I have to be at Divisional HQ. 
 Can we offer you a lift? 
 You've got a car? 
 Follow me. 
 Faulty equipment everywhere. 
 Where's the ammunition? 
 Chaps are lucky if they go out on a dusk-to-dawn patrol with a dozen rounds. 
 We've found the front. 
 We're miles from the front. 
 I say. What's this? Oh. 
 Splendid show. 
 Taking no chances, eh? 
 Real gumption. 
 Excellent. What's your platoon? 
 Sorry, Brigadier Harcourt, you've just been captured by the enemy. 
 Would you mind getting out please, sir? 
 This your idea, Devlin? 
 Don't worry, Brigadier, we'll inform your HQ. 
 But your men are wearing Home Guard uniforms, Captain Devlin! 
 Damn it, you're behind our lines. 
 This is not in the plan. 
 If Jerry does come, let's hope he remembers to bring the plan. 
 What's the point of the exercise if you don't play by the rules? 
 To teach you how to deal with the Germans. 
 Lesson one: don't believe everything you see. 
 I hope your men realise that in the field the enemy would be entitled to shoot them for wearing its uniforms. 
 In this war it's the winners who'll decide who gets shot. 
 Foyle, tell him he can't do this. 
 Looks as if he already has. 
 We'll try to make your stay pleasant. 
 Landlord here pulls a good pint. 
 I'm going to leave you to it. 
 Foyle, you can't leave. 
 If I stay I'd have to arrest you - this pub should have closed an hour ago. 
 
 
 
 Take Brigadier Harcourt inside, look after him. Be right back. 
 [ TWIG SNAPS ] 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 What's your name? 
 Prentiss, sir. 
 Did you hear that? 
 That was a shot. 
 There shouldn't be any shooting in this zone. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 For heaven's sake, Prentiss, whatever your captain's planning he'll have done it by now. 
 We should see where that shooting's coming from. 
 The game is over. 
 Will you please let us go? 
 Harry? 
 Single bullet through the head. 
 Went right through. An accident? 
 Plenty of guns, but this was the demarcation point - no live ammunition here. 
 How many shots did he say? 
 Three. 
 What happened to the other two, then? 
 And how did the killer miss twice? 
 Look at the burn marks. 
 He must have been right on top of him. 
 Why didn't he make a run for it? 
 You definitely heard three shots? 
 Yes. About half a minute apart. 
 I knew there was something wrong straightaway, but by the time I'd got here... 
 Poor boy. 
 I gave him the order to guard the perimeter. 
 You heard the brigadier request it. 
 This was my fault. 
 Sir, I've just heard. 
 We were just talking about him! 
 Almost seems like fate. 
 Yes, doesn't it? 
 May I look at the body? 
 I'd rather not. 
 I only want to help, sir. 
 You could help by saying what you did after you left the brigadier. 
 What? You don't think I could have had anything to do with this? 
 You know, I have to ask. 
 I was heading over to Divisional HQ to make my report. 
 By car? No. 
 I thought I could make it on foot. 
 Then I heard about the accident, so I turned round. Came straight here. 
 Whatever it is, it's not an accident. 
 No, sir. I can see that now. 
 Right. Thank you. 
 Sir. 
 Do you want me to check his story, sir? 
 I should. 
 Where to, sir? 
 Greenwood Farm. 
 You don't care about Harry, Mr Foyle. 
 All you ever wanted was to see him in jail. You even lied in court. 
 You knew what was going on, and you didn't have any evidence on him. 
 You had no real evidence, so you just had to cheat! 
 Your brother served three months for a crime he committed. 
 I suppose the end justifies the means. Is that it? 
 I've never believed that. 
 I don't know what I'm going to do now without him. 
 I don't know what I'm going to do! 
 (SOBS) 
 I'd like to help. 
 How can you help me? 
 Finding out who killed him would be a good start. 
 Did you know that he'd started burglary again? 
 No. He told me he'd stopped. 
 You did know he broke into Greenwood Hall? I knew. 
 I knew. 
 He promised me he was going to give up thieving, Mr Foyle. 
 And then to think - God! 
 Whatever he was doing at the hall I know he was doing it for someone else. 
 A man came to the house. 
 It was the same day of the break-in. 
 Did you see him? 
 No. 
 Oh, but he left this. 
 Any idea what he did with whatever it was he took? 
 He said it was being looked after by friends. 
 Is that all he said? 
 Something about them being busy. 
 But he could trust them. 
 Which friends might these be? 
 Oh, there were these two people that he used to see all the time before he went to prison. 
 And who are they? 
 Connor. 
 Michael Connor and Albert Clarke. 
 We had nothing to do with it. 
 You have three convictions. 
 Burglary and assault. 
 Is that how you knew him? 
 You worked together? 
 According to your platoon commander Mr Philby you disappeared in the wood, a few minutes before Markham was shot dead. 
 We disappeared. 
 What did you think we'd do? 
 Go traipsing around on some stupid war game? 
 We never saw him or went near him. 
 You'd already beaten him. 
 It was a gentleman's disagreement. 
 Did you want to work with him? 
 Well, yeah. We discussed it. 
 But he didn't want any part of it. 
 He said he'd had enough. 
 You didn't believe him. 
 You know as well as I do he burgled Sir Reginald Walker's place. 
 It's obvious. 
 Look, we had nothing to do with it. 
 And you have got nothing on us. 
 So, what are you gonna do, eh? 
 Why don't you plant some more false evidence and hope this time a judge doesn't notice? 
 [ KNOCK AT DOOR ] 
 Sir Reginald, I have to speak to you. 
 I'm very busy, Philby. 
 What do you want? 
 I have to talk to you about this man Harold Markham. 
 What about him? 
 He was killed. 
 He was killed in your grounds. 
 I ordered him to stay on guard. 
 Somebody accidentally let off a gun and killed him. 
 That's not what the police say. 
 You know, Philby, maybe you should get away for a while. 
 Recently you seem to have been under a lot of strain. 
 Well, this business in Switzerland. 
 Of course, but we've broken no laws. 
 We've done nothing wrong. 
 So you say. 
 And you think otherwise? 
 No. 
 You're a good man, Philby. 
 And after the war you'll be a very wealthy one. 
 But you need to concentrate more on the wider canvas. 
 As it happens I have just the assignment for you. 
 Miss Patterson, could you book a call to our New York office? 
 'Yes, sir.' 
 Christopher. 
 Stephen. 
 Can I help? 
 You remember Harry Markham? 
 Markham. 
 I remember him well, of course. 
 I'm sure we both do. 
 When did you last see him? 
 About three or four days ago. 
 I...visited him at his farm. 
 Why was that? 
 You need to ask after what happened? 
 Not what happened last year. 
 I'm talking about now and the events leading up to his death. 
 This is a murder investigation? 
 It is. 
 I... was interested in Markham because I was concerned about him. 
 After he came out of prison I saw him... occasionally. 
 You'd be surprised to learn, then, that on the same day you went to the farm he broke into the house of a local industrialist? 
 Yes. I would be very surprised. 
 And I'd be very offended If I thought that you of all people would imagine that I wouldn't know when you weren't telling me the truth. 
 All right. 
 Markham was working for me. 
 I left Germany in February '35. 
 But what you may not know is that if I had stayed, I would almost certainly have been killed because I had been speaking out against the Nazis. 
 And in the end I was denounced. 
 Since then I have tried to fight my own war. 
 I'm collecting information about English businessmen who are cosy with the Nazis. 
 In particular, Sir Reginald Walker of Empire & European Foods. 
 Do you know what they do? 
 They make margarine. 
 Yes. Amongst other things. 
 But let's stick with margarine for the moment. 
 Germany has lost access to all sorts of food resources. 
 Edible oils and fats are in short supply. 
 Without them you can't make a whole range of foods. 
 You can't cook. 
 You can't make soap or detergent. 
 You can't even make margarine. 
 So if the food system breaks down, it all breaks down. 
 You won't win a war if you can't feed your people. 
 Now... a week ago Simon Walker... was in Geneva dealing directly with an SS officer working for the Reichs Kommissariat. 
 Right. Well... if they own the company and are still dealing with the Germans, they're contravening the Trading With The Enemy Act and face prison. 
 But you'd need evidence. 
 Which you sent Markham to get? 
 Yes. 
 And the evidence is what? 
 There was a letter Simon Walker brought with him from Switzerland. 
 It was an agreement between Empire & European Foods and the Reichs Kommissariat. 
 In essence, a trading agreement between Sir Reginald Walker and the Third Reich. 
 How do you know about that? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Let me show you something. 
 My dear wife Anna did not live long after she came home. 
 I've never spoken to you of my son. 
 He would be the same age as your son. 
 But we left him in Germany. 
 We... 
 ..lost him to the Nazis. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't ask for your pity, Christopher, just your understanding. 
 Don't be surprised if my sense of morality is a little frayed at the edges. 
 This letter would have been enough, do you think? 
 I believe so. 
 Is this what he found in the safe? 
 Certainly Markham found something. 
 Whatever it was I believe they killed him to get it back. 
 Are you really sure it's murder? 
 There were manoeuvres in progress. 
 Plenty of room for error. 
 The evidence suggests it's unlikely to have been an accident. 
 I don't see it has anything to do with me. 
 On the contrary. It might have a great deal to do with you since we believe it was Markham who broke into your house. 
 Really? And the shot wounds we found in his shoulder and on his back rather give the lie to your son's claim to have fired in the air. 
 It was pitch dark. 
 Nobody knew quite what had happened. 
 I think you should be careful what you say, Chief Superintendent. 
 My son did not lie. 
 I'm still rather puzzled why you didn't want to report the break-in. 
 I've already explained. 
 It wasn't anything to do with certain papers that might have been taken from the safe? Papers? 
 About your son's visit to Switzerland. 
 Nothing was taken. I told you that. 
 Let me tell you something, Mr Foyle, you may be at war, but I'm not. 
 Because business is bigger than war. 
 I can give you a dozen British companies, household names, that are involved in Germany. 
 Petrol. Food. Automobiles. 
 Do you know, since the Nazis marched into Paris sales of cars in France have actually increased? 
 And why not? 
 The bombs that are falling on London now are being dropped by planes which were designed by so-called friends. 
 War doesn't matter. 
 You and I don't matter. 
 Business will go on. 
 Oh, thank you for that fascinating insight. 
 One of your directors, Philby, was with the Home Guard. 
 How do I get to speak to him? 
 I'm very sorry. 
 He left just a little while ago. 
 You've missed him. 
 We have to go round the back. 
 Why? 
 I dunno. It's what happens when people have these great big houses. 
 You know what Miss Stewart said. 
 What? 
 We're not meant to respass. 
 Respass? 
 Trespass. I don't know. 
 We're not trespassing. Anyway, look at the stuff they're burning. 
 It's a waste! 
 If we don't collect salvage, we'll never win the prize. 
 Come on, then. 
 Keep watch. 
 Are you sure about this, Pa? 
 I would always have preferred to have kept nothing in writing. 
 And after the war? 
 There are copies in Switzerland. 
 All this must go. 
 You're not panicking? 
 No. But there are certain pressures on us. 
 This man Foyle. 
 The death of Markham. 
 You don't know anything about that? 
 Of course not. I needed him alive. 
 Exactly. We both did. 
 What are you two up to? 
 Nothing. 
 How much more? 
 We're almost done. 
 You seem to have invited some children to your bonfire. What?! 
 Simon, you bloody fool! 
 What? 
 Stop them! 
 How? 
 Set the dogs on them! 
 They're children for God's sake! 
 They're thieves. 
 I'm protecting my property. 
 You can't! 
 You don't understand. 
 No, I don't! What's so important about these papers? 
 I've already told you, you stupid woman, it's my business! 
 Come on. Quickly. 
 I'm coming. 
 You're not fast enough. 
 I'm coming. 
 No, you're not. 
 I'm trying. 
 Watch out for the dogs! 
 Get over the wall. 
 OK. 
 Well, quickly, then. 
 I am! 
 Can you get up? 
 Ow! 
 The papers. 
 Forget 'em. 
 Are you all right? 
 Ah! My leg. 
 We can't give you any more time, Mr Beck. 
 I have a feeling my business in England may already be over. 
 When am I leaving? 
 Saturday night. 
 If I could rearrange the war to suit your own schedule, I'd gladly do it. 
 But it's not as simple as that. 
 Life isn't just about a schedule, Miss Pearce. 
 Sir Reginald Walker and his son have rearranged my entire life. 
 Now there are other people's lives at stake. 
 The people who will fly you to Germany, who will meet you. 
 The people who have agreed to help you. Yes. 
 [ DOOR BANGS ] 
 We can't wait any longer. 
 Just promise me one thing. 
 This business with the Walkers, you won't give up! 
 There's a Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle on the case. 
 Yes. 
 He won't give up. 
 Sir. 
 You finished? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I spoke to the Home Guard about Devlin's movements before the shots were fired. And? 
 Ten minutes still unaccounted for. 
 He could have made his way to Divisional HQ as he said, but he could have doubled back. 
 Right. 
 See this? 
 London secretary falls to her death. 
 She fell from the Empire & European Foods building. 
 Dig out what you can about it. 
 Sir. It says her father lives in Hastings. 
 Good place to start. 
 Oh. Hi. 
 Let me see. Ooh! 
 Wounded in action. 
 Yes, miss. 
 You were salvaging paper. Where? 
 We were at this hall. 
 Sir Reginald Walker's place. 
 He set his dogs on us. German dogs. 
 Roverman. 
 Roverman. I think you mean Doberman. 
 Tim, we'll have to drive you to hospital. 
 Have you told his parents? 
 If you think that's bad, you should see what his dad will do. 
 He'll have to know sometime. 
 Help me get him into the car. 
 Here we go. 
 I just want to say that I'm extremely sorry that I spoke to you in the way that I did. 
 I will see that the child is all right, and give some sort of compensation if necessary. 
 It was a complete loss of control. 
 It will never happen again. 
 It wasn't control that you lost. 
 It was the pretence. 
 I'm sorry? 
 That you're a civilised man. 
 Mr Brown. 
 Yes. 
 Sergeant Milner, isn't it? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I never forget a witness. 
 The pottery workers. 
 One strangled the other with a belt. 
 I've come to talk to you about your daughter Agnes. 
 I'm sorry about your loss. 
 I've got nothing to say about Agnes. 
 She worked as a secretary at Empire & European Foods in London. There was an accident. 
 That's what they said. Yes. 
 Did you not believe them? 
 I've spent my whole life working for justice. 
 Well, the police investigated, and they say she fell. 
 And that's the justice that I got. 
 My Agnes would never have fallen out of a window. 
 She was scared of heights. 
 If the window had been open, she wouldn't have gone near. 
 Did you tell the police this? 
 Of course I told them. 
 But it's a big company. 
 Big business. 
 Sir Reginald Walker. 
 They didn't want any scandal. 
 You didn't talk to anyone? 
 I talked to Mr Beck. 
 Of course, he felt bad about it. 
 If it wasn't for him she wouldn't have been there. 
 He said there was nothing I could do. 
 There was no evidence. 
 No witnesses. 
 And he'd know, wouldn't he? 
 Stephen Beck knew your daughter? 
 Got her the job. 
 He saw it advertised and gave her a reference. 
 They were very close, the two of them. Friends. 
 It wasn't his fault. 
 But I wish she'd never met him. 
 If it wasn't for Mr Beck she'd still be here. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry I'm late, sir. 
 Where have you been? 
 I've been at the hospital. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yes. I was visiting a friend. 
 Tim Howard. One of the salvage boys. 
 He was at Greenwood Hall yesterday. 
 You won't believe it, but Sir Reginald set his dogs on them. 
 Tim had been badly bitten. 
 What were they up to? 
 Collecting paper. 
 Sir Reginald was burning it. 
 They took some and he went berserk. 
 Do you know what they took? 
 Do you know where it is? Yes. 
 I'm afraid there's quite a bit of it. 
 The children have been bringing their stuff over for months. 
 Hello, Brian. 
 Good morning, sir. 
 Been busy? 
 Tim nearly lost his leg. 
 It was eaten by a dog. 
 Yes. So I heard. 
 We need to find some of the papers you took from the big house. 
 Know where they are? 
 No. 
 There's loads. 
 Any of it been collected yet? 
 No. We need to keep them till we get the prize for collecting salvage. 
 If we don't, they'll never know how much we got. 
 All right. 
 Would you know where you put it? 
 Yeah. I'll show you. It's in here. 
 How's the leg, Tim? 
 Getting better. 
 Right. 
 Let's get started. 
 We're definitely going to win this prize. 
 And the chocolate! 
 Lucy. 
 Mr Walker. 
 I just wanted to say how sorry I was to hear about your brother. Thanks. 
 First your father, now him. 
 You must feel very on your own. 
 Well, you know - 
 Look, if there's anything I can do to help. 
 And there are some things we have to discuss. 
 Can I offer you some tea? 
 Mm. Thank you. 
 I realise it's difficult, but I do have to talk to you about the rent. 
 Your brother left you six months behind. 
 I'm not planning to stay. 
 I'll move on. 
 That won't help with the debt. 
 The last thing I want to do is put you under pressure. 
 Mr Walker, I don't know what I can do. I don't have any money. 
 I want to help. 
 Now, I don't suppose you ever... 
 What? 
 ..saw anything in your brother's possession that didn't belong to him. 
 No. 
 We're talking abut a box. 
 About this big. It's not valuable. 
 But it belonged to my mother, and it was taken from the house. 
 You don't know it was Harry that broke in. 
 No. We don't know that for certain, but it seems likely. 
 I never saw anything. 
 Lucy, I want to help you. 
 You're not helping me. 
 We can forget about the debt. 
 I can help you start again. 
 (Thank you.) 
 But I want it back, and if you try to sell it, I promise you you'll end up just like Harry. 
 Thanks for the tea. 
 Simon? 
 What are you doing down here? 
 Passing the time. 
 You shouldn't be down here. 
 You left the door open. 
 Are you worried about your new wife? Is that it? 
 You needn't be. She's left you. 
 There's a letter on your desk. 
 I put her in a taxi. 
 You should have spent more time in Germany. 
 Mummy loved it there, didn't she? 
 All those holidays before the war when we were a family. 
 Simon - 
 No. People like us, people like who you used to be... 
 ..we're the strong ones. 
 We are the ones who will make the new England. 
 You're leaving? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 Is this... 
 ..what you wanted? 
 Do you know what this says? 
 Well, my German's not quite up to it. 
 It is agreed in return for full cooperation, the development of new food products, all property and assets previously seized will be returned to Empire & European Foods by the German Reich subsequent to... et cetera, et cetera. 
 Et cetera. 
 It is unambiguous. 
 Would seem to be. 
 How did you get this? 
 With difficulty. 
 Thank you. 
 Well. 
 Thank you. 
 If I'm to do my job, how can I let you leave? 
 Mm. Sorry? 
 You've instigated a burglary, which is against the law. 
 The man you recruited to commit the burglary has been murdered. 
 You think I killed him? 
 You're responsible for his death, and the death of Agnes Brown, the woman you put into Empire & European Foods. 
 A lot of people seem to lose their lives in close proximity to you. 
 I told you. I'm fighting a war. 
 Which makes your behaviour ethically acceptable? 
 The Nazis might claim the same. 
 I do what I have to. 
 Help me understand why you shouldn't pay for this in exactly the same way that anyone else might have to. 
 You're right. 
 I will try and help you if I can. 
 Please... 
 ..come with me. 
 This lady is... 
 Hilda Pearce. 
 Huh! At least that's what she calls herself. 
 I now work for her. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Can we tell him? 
 No. 
 But I think we will, anyway. 
 Miss Pearce represents an organisation which is quite new to this country. 
 But it can be briefly described as overseas intelligence. 
 They are sending me back to Germany because I still have contacts with the Communist and Socialist groups. 
 And my job is to help form a resistance. 
 Mr Beck leaves tomorrow night. 
 It's unlikely I will return. 
 Agents such as myself do not last long. 
 What about the letter? 
 Miss Pearce will deal with that. 
 I have every faith in her. 
 There is one other thing you should know. 
 I once told you that I had been denounced, and that was the reason why I had to leave. 
 It was my son who denounced me. 
 There was a boy he had met. 
 An English boy, who was even more fanatical and anti-Semitic than the Nazis. 
 His name, this boy, was... 
 ..Simon Walker. 
 Now do you understand? 
 You've been a good friend to me, Christopher. 
 I will miss our fishing trips together. 
 I will miss you. 
 Don't let him down. 
 I'm rejoining my unit. 
 We're being sent to North Africa. 
 Well, good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 Sir, I...I want to say... 
 I'm sorry about Markham. 
 Sorry that he's dead, or sorry about what happened six months ago? 
 Would I need to apologise for that? 
 Well, you tell me. 
 He was guilty, sir. 
 Yes, he was found guilty of breaking and entering, but the theft charge had to be dropped. 
 Did it? 
 Yes. 
 Why, sir? 
 The necklace that we submitted as primary evidence had to be withdrawn. 
 Who withdrew it? 
 I did. 
 Why? 
 Because, Devlin, it turned out to be you who took the necklace from the house he'd broken into. 
 You planted it in his house. 
 You were so determined to see the man jailed you wrecked the case to the point the judge almost set him free. 
 You perverted the course of justice. 
 And he might still be alive if it hadn't been for your unforgivable interference. 
 Even though I was in France... when the case came to court... 
 ..why didn't you tell me what had happened? 
 Because I chose not to disclose these details to the court or you. 
 He was guilty despite the evidence, not because of it. 
 You'd chosen to fight for your country and were no longer around. 
 It seemed to serve no purpose. 
 You could have had me charged. 
 Yeah. 
 You still could. 
 Yeah. 
 I think you should go, don't you? 
 Sir.

 I want to dedicate today's service to Stephen Beck... 
 ..who played the organ here on many occasions, but who was forced to leave our community quite suddenly... 
 ..due to an illness in his family. 
 He will be missed. 
 Thanks for all your hard work. 
 I understand Devlin has rejoined his unit, sir. 
 Yes, that's right. 
 He's not a suspect? 
 No. I think we can safely rule him out of the picture. 
 So your job's safe. 
 Minister : So, you won the competition. 
 That's right. 
 It was chocolate all round. 
 I've eaten mine. 
 It was well-deserved. 
 Yes. They've been busy little bees. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, then. 
 Bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 I thought I should give you the bad news. 
 Beck? No. 
 He's all right as far as we know. 
 About the letter. 
 What about it? 
 It didn't work. It should have. 
 Under normal circumstances it would have. 
 But Sir Reginald Walker has been more clever than we thought. 
 Of course he's making huge profits out of the Nazis. 
 But he's managed to persuade the British government he can use his contacts to their advantage. 
 He passes on low-grade information. 
 They turn a blind eye. 
 Believe me, I made sure the letter went to the right people. 
 They just didn't want to know. 
 So he trades with the enemy with the Government's unofficial blessing? 
 Elements within the government, anyway. 
 'It's just a piece of paper.' 
 That's what they say. 
 It isn't enough. 
 What more do they want? 
 They didn't say. 
 But I'm afraid, in the absence of any further evidence, Sir Reginald Walker is in the clear. 
 I appreciate your telling me. 
 Thank you for taking the trouble. 
 I thought I owed it to Stephen Beck. 
 And it occurred to me that you might not want to give up. 
 Walker has his supporters, but there are plenty of people who dislike him as much as you and I. 
 [ BUZZING ] 
 There is something. 
 How did you know it would be there? 
 Well, I didn't. It's my driver who knows about these things. 
 Do I, sir? 
 Yeah. 
 But your brother told you. 
 Did he? 
 No. He told me it was being looked after by friends. 
 Do you have friends who... 
 Oh! Busy bees! 
 Where did you find it? 
 It was in the beehive. 
 I was just telling the bees about Harry. 
 You have to do that when there's been a death, and there it was. 
 You didn't tell anyone? 
 No. 
 You sure it's not valuable? 
 It's so beautiful. 
 It has sentimental value. 
 Thank you for returning it. 
 I'll see myself out. 
 There you are, Pa. We got it back. 
 We're in the clear. 
 [ QUIET CONVERSATION ] 
 Here she comes. 
 [ DOOR OPENS ] 
 Mr Foyle. 
 I didn't hear you announced. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm here to confirm your property has been safely returned to you. 
 And to arrest your son for the murders of Harry Markham and Agnes Brown. 
 I beg your pardon! 
 What are you talking about? 
 Nonsense! 
 I didn't kill Markham. I had every reason to want him alive. 
 That's right. 
 Because he'd stolen that. 
 Where's your proof? 
 Well, you are. 
 On the day of the murder it wasn't me you were looking for at the Home Guard headquarters, it was him. 
 Running short of personnel, would you believe it? 
 They need you to place a few men on the outskirts of the lower wood on the Greenwood Estate to keep the public away. Sir. 
 Can't have people where's there's live ammunition. 
 Right, sir. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 Mr Walker. 
 I was told you were here, so I came to see you. I owe you an apology. 
 'You didn't know I'd be there. 
 You were very surprised to see me, but you tried to pretend you weren't. 
 You were looking for Markham and Philby. 
 You persuaded him to get Markham to guard your estate, so you'd know exactly where he was, and he'd be on his own.' 
 I'm just about to join my men. 
 'As an employee of yours, Philby felt obliged to do it.' 
 And since he's the one man who can implicate you in the death it's probably the reason he's not around - where did you post him? 
 He's at our American office. 
 Markham was a thief. 
 He stole from us. 
 But I had no reason to kill him. 
 You didn't intend to, did you? Lots of games going on that afternoon. 
 Blanks and live ammunition were used in the Home Guard exercise, and you used blanks and live ammunition in the game you were playing with Markham. 
 Hello, Harry. 
 Mr Walker. 
 I wouldn't do that. 
 The last shot was a blank. 
 This one's real. 
 What are you doing? 
 Russian roulette. 
 That gives you a one-in-six chance. 
 Lucky. 
 Bloody hell! 
 The box you stole from my father's safe - I want to know where it is. 
 It wasn't me. 
 This next bullet could be the one. 
 Not just a bang, but the one. 
 You won't do it. 
 I never went anywhere near. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 Gambling man, are you? 
 You're mad. 
 Let's try again. 
 Simon, please. 
 [ CHAMBER SPINS ] 
 'You didn't mean to kill him. 
 He got the live round before you got the information. 
 You wanted to know where the box was.' 
 Three shots, half a minute apart. 
 Only one bullet hole because there was only one live bullet. 
 The other two were blanks which produced the scorch marks on his face. 
 Simon. 
 I'm afraid it's true, Pa. 
 You killed him. 
 It happened like he said. 
 I didn't mean to. But I'm strong. 
 I don't care what happens to me. 
 And when the Germans win the war we'll be remembered as heroes. 
 It was also you who murdered Agnes Brown. 
 I will not listen to any more. 
 I killed her. 
 'I heard her on the telephone, and you know what happened.' 
 'That's what I learned in Germany.' 
 When someone gets in your way you have to act. 
 That's the genius of Hitler. 
 In a way, that makes him the greatest businessman of all. 
 Mr Walker. 
 (Simon!) 
 My God! 
 Where's your wife? 
 She's left me. 
 Not much of a day for you, is it? 
 Your wife. Your son. 
 Your business. 
 My business? 
 Do you know what this is? 
 It's a gift. 
 But do you know what it is? 
 It's solid gold, and it's a gift given... 
 ..to my company in recognition of successful trade relations. 
 A gift from who? 
 The Office for Trade. 
 The German Office for Trade? 
 Yes. 
 And you didn't disclose its theft because...? 
 Because my son did not declare it. 
 He smuggled it into this country from Switzerland a few weeks ago. 
 You're right. It is solid gold. 
 It hasn't been declared. 
 It certainly only came in recently. 
 And it might well have come from the trade office originally, but it's first of all come through a department of the Third Reich called the Firmenverkehrsstelle the property transfer office - which deals with and processes property acquired by the Nazis. 
 'This is a Jewish artefact, made in Frankfurt in the 18th Century by Jeremiah Sobel. 
 And until six weeks ago, it belonged to a family called the Rothenbergs, who used it as a prayer book holder.' 
 The family - all four of them, were shot, and their home looted by the Nazis. 
 Once it's generally known you're a beneficiary of this Nazi reallocation of property, how long do you think you and your company have got? 
 One or two things bigger than business, wouldn't you say? 
 Aren't you going to arrest me? 
 Well, on behalf of a very dear friend of mine... 
 ..I'd say it was no longer necessary. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 Hold on to him. 
 Father! 
 [ EXPLOSION ] 
 War does different things to different people. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 [ TYRES SQUEAL ] 
 They're cowards, hiding from the war cos they can afford it. 
 Mr Foyle, I'm suspending you from duty pending investigation. 
 What are you taking about?
