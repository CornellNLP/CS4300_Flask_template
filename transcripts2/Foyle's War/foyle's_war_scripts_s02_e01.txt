 Hello. 
 ♪ MOONLIGHT SONATA ON PIANO ♪ 
 That's nice. 
 Actually I was only playing it to annoy Mrs Harrison. 
 The Moonlight Sonata. 
 She says it's German music. 
 [ AIR RAID SIREN ] 
 [ DISTANT THUD OF BOMBS ] 
 Oh, no. 
 Come on, Sam. We're going down to the cellar. 
 Can't you just tell Jerry to come back later? 
 [ SCREECH OF BOMB ] 
 [ FOLLOWED BY EXPLOSION ] 
 [ FIRE ENGINE BELL ] 
 Come on, lads, quickly. 
 Lives to save. 
 Dear, dear, dear. 
 What's your name? 
 Harrison. 
 Mrs Esther Harrison. 
 My tortoise was... 
 The tortoise is fine. 
 You've got a few bruises. Come along to the hospital with me. 
 Oh! 
 How many killed? 
 Who are you? 
 Colin Morton, with The Chronicle. 
 One. 
 They're carrying her out now. 
 Anyone inside? 
 No, we got 'em all out. 
 Don't let anyone come in. 
 In here looks likely. 
 Ken... 
 Stay on guard. 
 Keep your eyes peeled. 
 Oh... 
 Christopher? 
 I thought it was you. 
 Arthur Lewes. Remember me? 
 Of course. What are you doing in Hastings? 
 I live here now. Bought a house a year ago. Romney Point. 
 I was hoping I'd bump into you. 
 In fact, I was talking about you only the other night. 
 I don't suppose you've heard of a man called Howard Paige? 
 American. Something to do with cars. 
 Yes. Invented the syncro-mesh gear system. Made himself a fortune. 
 He's coming to stay. 
 And he needs police protection? 
 No, nothing like that. 
 He'll be in the house and I am throwing a dinner for him. 
 Would you come? 
 It's been suggested to me that he might like to meet a few of the local...VIPs. 
 Can't imagine why you're inviting me, then. 
 I thought you'd say that. 
 No, I want to give him an idea of what life's really like down here on the south coast. 
 Actually, it's quite important. 
 He's going back to Washington soon and the Americans are quite keen to know what's going on over here. 
 I really would appreciate it, and I know Elizabeth would be more than happy to see you. 
 Erm... How is she? 
 Oh, ask her yourself. 
 She'll be here in a minute. 
 Would eight o'clock be all right? 
 Yes, all right. 
 Oh, black tie, I'm afraid. 
 Yes, well, if I can find it. 
 Good man. Oh, here she is. 
 Christopher. 
 Elizabeth. 
 This is a surprise. 
 He's agreed to join us for dinner tonight. 
 Oh, that's excellent. I'm afraid entertaining rich Americans isn't quite my forte. 
 Nonsense. You'll be splendid. 
 So, how are you, Christopher? 
 It's been a long time. 
 Yes. I thought you were still in London. 
 Well, I never really took to London. 
 Erm... 
 But of course, I'm glad we're not there now. 
 Yes, yes, pretty bad. You know the Palace took a hit? Yes, I heard. 
 They say the King was actually grateful to the Germans. 
 Put him on the same level as everyone else. 
 A propaganda coup. 
 I'm just happy to be back in Hastings. 
 Well... 
 Until tonight. 
 Yes, eight o'clock. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Sir... 
 I thought I should come and find you. It's Sam. 
 Sam, are you all right? 
 Oh, sir. Sorry I didn't report in. 
 Couldn't matter less. Do sit down. 
 Are you all right? 
 I'm all right. 
 Sure? 
 I shouldn't be. I was lying in bed. 
 They say it was a flying pencil. 
 Anybody hurt? 
 Jenny Wentworth. 
 I'm afraid she was killed. 
 It's so unfair. She was a driver with the ambulance service. 
 She only moved in here a couple of weeks ago. 
 She was standing right outside my door. 
 She was only a year older than me. 
 23. 
 Get her to the station. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Actually, I'd rather stay. 
 Would you mind talking to Mrs Harrison? 
 She was my landlady. 
 This is her house. 
 Are you the policeman? 
 Are you Mr Foyle? 
 Yes. 
 I want you to do something. 
 My husband's coin collection - my late husband - he was a sub editor on the Eastbourne Chronicle and a keen collector all his life. 
 Are you saying the coins have been taken? 
 That's exactly what I'm saying. 
 I kept them in a box on the mantelpiece. 
 This is the box. 
 I found it on the floor, intact and empty. 
 And the coins aren't the only thing that's gone missing, I assure you. 
 There are some pieces of jewellery. 
 A pearl necklace that belonged to my mother, a solid silver brooch. 
 Had these been valued? 
 No. 
 But there were coins in there that dated back to the Normans. 
 Jack always said it would be a nice nest egg for me. 
 And you kept them in the box? 
 It was his box. 
 It was where he left them. 
 I'm very sorry about your house, Mrs Harrison. 
 We're at war. It's to be expected. 
 But this... 
 The idea that somebody went in there looting last night... 
 That I find hard to forgive. 
 What about finding somewhere else to live? 
 I'll find something, sir. 
 Presumably there was a warden posted, wasn't there? 
 Yes, sir. 
 He had the house boarded up. 
 And who actually went in after the explosion? 
 Just about the whole street was in at one time or another. Chaos. 
 The ambulance service came first. 
 Poor Jenny. 
 Then there was a doctor. Doctor Redmund. He gave me a check-up. 
 Anybody else? 
 The AFS. There were four of them. 
 Then a photographer who turned up out of the blue. 
 Get the name? 
 No. 
 He was from The Chronicle. 
 Harrison worked as a sub-editor there. 
 Funny, I never knew that. 
 I never knew anything about Mrs Harrison. 
 She was just the landlady. I always thought she was a bit of a dragon. 
 Edward IV. Who's that? 
 Edward the Fourth, you idiot. 
 And I want that. 
 I bet you do. 
 It goes with the rest, like we agreed. 
 I never agreed. 
 Well, I did and that's all that matters. 
 Tom? 
 Where'd you put it all, anyway? 
 Somewhere nobody will ever find it. 
 What's the matter with you, Kenny? 
 Cat got your tongue? 
 I'm going home. 
 Now that's not very friendly, is it, Kenny? 
 Leave off. My dad'll want to know where I've been. 
 Worry about you, does he, your dad? 
 Look, we're taking too much. 
 We're going to get caught. 
 I heard this geezer in the pub. What we're doing, we could get hanged. 
 That's rubbish. 
 It's true. 
 They've got new regulations. 
 I don't want to be a part of this any more. 
 You are part of it, Kenny. 
 You're in it up to your neck. 
 What are you going to do about him? 
 And his dad? 
 You leave them to me. 
 Richard. 
 What is it? 
 Salmon. And don't complain. 
 It's the last of the tins. 
 I don't know what we're going to do. 
 There's nothing in the house. 
 Where have you been? 
 Where'd you think? 
 That's no way to talk to your father. 
 Sit down. I'm just serving tea. 
 Dad, I want to talk to you. 
 What about? 
 You know what about. 
 De Havilland's. 
 Forget it, Ken. 
 You're not going to Hatfield. 
 The answer's no. 
 I've worked it out. 
 I just need... 
 And I can't help you. I haven't got it. There's nothing I can do. 
 I'm wasting my time here. 
 You could help out in the shop a bit more. 
 Selling bolts and washers at halfpenny a time? 
 It's a living. 
 No way near, and you know it. 
 Oh, come on, Dad, you know how much it means to me. I've got the place. 
 I haven't got the money to pay for it. 
 Well, maybe I can find the money another way. 
 With that lot of yours? 
 I know what you're up to. 
 You think I don't but I do. 
 And I'm going to put a stop to it. 
 Really. 
 You haven't done anything for 20 years. Why start now? 
 Stop it. 
 You're all talk. 
 That's all you've ever been. 
 To hell with this. 
 I don't have to take this, not in my own house. 
 Where are you going? 
 To t'pub. 
 Now look what you've done. 
 Howard. Welcome to Hastings. 
 Ah, Arthur. 
 You look terrific. 
 You've hardly changed at all. 
 If only that were true. 
 So how was your journey? 
 How was London? 
 It's been quite a week. 
 Oh, by the way, they've given me my own Man Friday. 
 This is John Bishop. 
 How do you do, sir? 
 Please. Come in. 
 So, how did the talks go? 
 Oh, it's just about signed and sealed. Now to see it delivered. 
 You've done tremendous work. 
 I must say, I don't know what we'd do without you. 
 I'll tell you what you'd do without us - lose the goddamn war. 
 Ah! Elizabeth. Howard's here. 
 This is my wife. 
 How do you do, Mr Paige? 
 Delighted to meet you. 
 And make that Howard. 
 Drink? 
 Oh, yes, please. 
 So, Arthur's told me a lot about your days together at Oxford. 
 Oh, 20 years ago. 
 Another world. When I came here I didn't know anything about anything. 
 Luckily, I found myself rooming with Arthur's family. 
 I'd never have been able to look after myself. 
 They loved having you. 
 And they're well? 
 Still in Oxford, yes. 
 I think they find the world an increasingly hard place to understand. 
 It's good versus evil, Arthur. 
 It's all it boils down to. 
 Nothing difficult about that. 
 Well, it's good to have you on the right side. Happy days. 
 Yes, happy days. 
 [ CONVERSATION CONTINUES ] 
 Oh, these damn cufflinks. 
 I... 
 I...can't get the thing to go through the thing! 
 Let me do it for you. 
 Oh... 
 Relax. 
 Well... 
 You get yourself in such a state. 
 Yes, yes. 
 You don't really want to go, do you? 
 What gave you that idea? 
 You don't like Americans. 
 They were late arrivals in the last war and it's looking more likely they won't show up for this one at all. 
 Oh, no. I'll be interested to hear what this man Paige has to say for himself. 
 Alan, you're not going to get into an argument. 
 I don't remember asking your opinion. 
 Sorry. It's done. 
 Thank you. 
 The Americans think we've lost this war. 
 That's the truth of it. 
 But what's even worse is... they don't care. 
 [ GULLS CRY AND GENTLE SOUND OF WAVES ] 
 Mr Hunter. How can I help you? 
 Good evening, Mrs Lewes. 
 I'd like to see Howard Paige. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I read in the paper he's staying here. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We're just about to have dinner. 
 And I'm not sure Mr Paige is seeing anyone. 
 I think he'll see me. 
 Well, if you'd like to wait here a moment I'll ask him. 
 Do you think it was the warden, sir? 
 Mrs Harrison's jewellery. 
 He was the last one in the house. 
 Well... 
 They say it's much worse in London. 
 I heard this story. A woman got bombed on her way home, knocked out. 
 When she came to someone was fiddling with her hand. 
 It was a policeman. At first she thought he was trying to help her. 
 Then she realised he was actually pinching her rings. 
 A policeman! 
 I don't think it was the warden. 
 No. 
 So, who are you having dinner with? 
 A man called Arthur Lewes. He's a good barrister. Knew him years ago. 
 You never mentioned him. 
 No. 
 Was that him? 
 No, it wasn't. 
 Well, I hope it wasn't the cook. 
 Thank you. 
 Elizabeth, hello. 
 You're looking well. 
 I'm glad you agreed to come. 
 So are you. 
 How's Andrew? 
 Andrew is very well. 
 And you've got two sons, is that right? 
 Yes, yes. Jack's in London at the MOI. 
 And my other son Christopher is still at school, thank God. 
 Christopher? 
 Yes. 
 Christopher. 
 Why is Elizabeth keeping you out in the hall? Come in. 
 This way. 
 [ RUSTLING ] 
 There's very little support for Herr Hitler in America but the question we're asking ourselves now is this - 
 Should we join you now and fight against a common enemy or consider this country the last frontier between Nazi Germany and ourselves? 
 You mean wait until we've lost the war and then decide what to do? 
 That's probably putting it a little strongly, Doctor Redmund. 
 If America doesn't enter the war, at the very least, helping us with arms and supplies, maybe we will lose. 
 We've seen what happened in France. 
 If we send you weapons now, how do we know they won't end up in German hands? 
 Is that what you think? 
 It's what many Americans think. 
 And they're afraid. 
 As a nation we don't want to go to war. 
 There are those that say we were hoodwinked last time around. 
 And this is an election year. 
 Mr Roosevelt has to be very careful how he proceeds. 
 Howard is very much a friend of this country. 
 He set up the committee - the American Allies of England. 
 We've been active in Washington. We've spent hundreds in the national press. 
 We're gradually changing public opinion, but give us time. 
 You think we have time? 
 Well, I hope so. 
 I really do. 
 Ahem. 
 I understand you have a son in the services, Mr Foyle? 
 Yes, he's in the RAF. 
 You must be worried sick about him. 
 Mmm. 
 Andrew was at Oxford, the same college as you. 
 Oh. Is that a fact? 
 Mr Paige was a Rhodes scholar. 
 Oh, right. 
 So, Oxford, the RAF... 
 No chance of him following in his father's footsteps and joining the police? 
 We've never discussed it. 
 Wasn't your father a policeman, Christopher? 
 Yes, he was a sergeant. 
 He talked you into this line of work? 
 We never discussed it. 
 It was always assumed that I'd follow in my father's footsteps, just as I've assumed my son won't. 
 I have sons, too. 
 Do you? 
 Do they listen to you? 
 Oh, sure they do. And then they do the opposite of what I say. 
 [ LAUGHTER ] 
 Yes. 
 All right. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I thought you'd gone home. 
 Not yet. 
 Have you managed to find anywhere yet? No. 
 I've been ringing round hotels and guest houses but it's amazing, they all seem to be full. 
 How many have you tried? 
 About a dozen. 
 What will you do if you can't find anywhere? 
 I don't know. 
 I suppose I'll have to stay here. 
 Maybe someone will give me a cell. 
 Funny. My father always said I'd end up behind bars. 
 You can't do that, Sam. You can come and stay with me, if you like. 
 Really? 
 Just for a few days, I mean. I don't want you to get the wrong idea. 
 But my wife is away with her sister, in Wales, and I have a spare room. 
 That'd be really tiggety-boo. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. There is one thing, though. 
 I don't think you should mention this to Mr Foyle. No. 
 I think you're right. 
 I don't think he'd approve. 
 This is very, very kind of you. 
 Don't mention it. 
 I'm glad you came, anyway. 
 I can't understand, here we both are, living in Hastings and I never see anything of you. 
 I'm afraid Mr Paige was rather tactless. 
 Well, he's American. 
 It would be nice to know why he's really here. 
 He's involved in some sort of talks up in Whitehall. Hush-hush. 
 Right. 
 Well, an interesting evening. 
 Thank you. 
 Christopher. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Could we meet? 
 I could call on you tomorrow afternoon. 
 Why? 
 Is there really anything to be said? 
 Yeah. 
 So much. 
 I'd like to see you. Could I? 
 Would you be there? 
 Elizabeth? 
 Thank you. 
 Good night. 
 You go in. 
 What is it? 
 I want to go for a walk. 
 [ BANG, FOLLOWED BY SHATTERING GLASS ] 
 Well, you seem a lot better today, Sam. 
 Just glad to be alive, I suppose, sir. 
 Yeah. Did you find somewhere to stay? 
 Mmm. 
 I'm being put up by a friend. 
 Good. 
 His name's Richard Hunter. 
 Aren't you going to write this down? 
 I am writing it down. 
 Now, you say he didn't come home last night. 
 He's never stayed out before. 
 Not all night. 
 He wasn't there this morning. 
 Do you know where he was going? 
 He didn't say. 
 Morning, sir. 
 Morning. 
 All right. 
 So, let's start with his age. 
 Sir, this looting business. 
 I started with the AFS, called out to Mrs Harrison, two nights ago. 
 They're from Station 41E, which is out on the Tideswell Road. 
 And then there was the photographer. 
 His name is Colin Morton. 
 The Eastbourne Chronicle have confirmed he is one of theirs. 
 He seems to have specialised in bombing raids. 
 Any of these been involved in lootings before? 
 Well, there have only been six cases reported in the last two months. 
 Luckily there weren't too many bombs. 
 But Colin Morton has turned up at no fewer than four of them, and this has to be more than a coincidence - 
 Station 41E, five out of six. 
 The station officer is a man called Henry Jamieson, who works as a lorry driver. 
 No police record that I can find but I'm still checking. 
 Let's visit him. 
 And I've yet to look into the others. 
 And this photographer, Colin Morton - who specialises in bombing raids. 
 Maybe he takes more than photographs. 
 Mr Jamieson. 
 Yes? 
 The name's Foyle. 
 I'm a police officer. 
 Can you spare a minute? 
 All day, providing the moaning minnies don't go off. 
 It's quiet at the moment. 
 Thankfully, yes. 
 I understand you were called out the other night. 
 Was I? 
 Elms Road. 
 The home of a Mrs Esther Harrison. 
 Elms Road. 
 Yes, I remember that. 
 The house copped the HE. 
 A young girl got killed. 
 That's right. 
 Tea? 
 No, thank you. 
 So, how can I help you? 
 Mrs Harrison claims some property belonging to her late husband has gone missing. 
 And you're calling me a thief? 
 Oh, not at all. I simply wondered if you or your men had spotted anything. 
 One of my men might have taken stuff? 
 Let me tell you something, Mr... 
 Foyle, was it? Yes. 
 Me and my lads, we do a tough bloody job. 
 48 hours on, 24 hours off. 
 No-one else does those sort of hours. I bet you don't. No. 
 And it's a stinking job. The real firemen hate us because we do the same work as them but much cheaper. 
 To the public we're 50-bob-a-week call-up dodgers, but we do it, cos we like to think we're doing our bit to help the war. 
 Very commendable. 
 Well, it doesn't make things any easier when people like you start coming round here, accusing my boys of looting. 
 Look at 'em. 
 Bob Fraser, Tom Fairweather, Ken Hunter, risking their lives night in, night out. 
 They're good lads. You should be ashamed for thinking otherwise. 
 I've made it perfectly clear. 
 I'm not accusing anybody of anything. 
 Just making enquiries. 
 Look, you won't find anything here. 
 Search the whole place if you like. 
 Oh, thank you. Milner, get them in. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Back to work. 
 They know it was us. 
 If they don't know anything they're not going to find anything. Relax. 
 I'm sorry. Colin's out for the day. 
 Went over to Wish Road. They got hit by a U-boat, would you believe it? 
 Fired from somewhere off of Cuckmere Haven. 
 Bloody Germans. 
 I ask you, what's the point in hitting a residential street? 
 That's not war, it's just cowardice. 
 Does Colin Morton always cover blast damage? 
 Not really. Evacuees, spitfire fund. 
 You name it he's done it. 
 Got his photos from the other night? 
 They have to come back from the Ministry of Information. 
 I had to send them in for the censors. 
 Look... 
 Come on, Chief Superintendent, do me a favour. 
 Tell me what this is about. 
 Wish I could. 
 We've always done you favours. 
 Put you on the front page when you make an arrest. Nice pics. 
 Yeah. Ask him to give me a call when he gets back in. 
 Absolutely nothing, sir. We searched the place from top to bottom. 
 But I've put together an inventory of everything that went missing from the houses where Jamieson was involved. 
 Coins, a necklace, silver thimbles, medals, cutlery. 
 It's more or less what you'd expect BUT they're leaving certain things behind. 
 A fur coat, an antique pocket watch, a stamp collection, another watch with a gold bracelet. 
 It's very selective. 
 (KNOCKS) Sorry to bother you, sir. 
 I've got something and with Mr Reid away and I'm not sure what to do. 
 Go on. 
 We've had a call from a Mr Letwin, Colonel Letwin, Home Guard. 
 I know it sounds barmy, sir, but he says he's arrested a Jerry spy. 
 Thank you for coming so promptly, Detective Chief Superintendent. 
 I wasn't quite sure who to call. 
 You're? 
 Letwin. Commanding Officer, No.1 Platoon, 58 Sussex Battalion, Home Guard. 
 I suppose you must be getting quite a few spy scares at the moment. 
 Oh, well. Nervous times. 
 Quite. 
 Actually, we've been on alert all morning. 
 I had one of my men report to me this morning. 
 He assured me he'd seen signals being made last night. 
 A flashing torch. 
 Reliable man? 
 Oh, yes. A retired headmaster. 
 Not one to stir things up. 
 He was walking the dog and swore he saw lights coming from Romney Point, signalling out to sea. 
 Is he sure? 
 That's what he said. 
 Anyway, I raised an alert and then we get a call from the landlord of the Dog and Duck. 
 He's got someone in there trying to buy a pint at 10am. 
 No knowledge of the licensing laws. 
 Exactly. 
 And what did you do? 
 We went round there, arrested him and brought him here. 
 He has no means of ID. 
 That's why we called you. 
 And you've spoken to him? 
 He doesn't seem in the mood to talk. 
 We gave him a cup of tea but that's about it. 
 Morning. 
 Speak English? 
 Of course. 
 But you're not English. 
 Are you German? 
 Scandinavian? 
 I have nothing to say to you. 
 Right, that's fine. Nothing to do with me, anyway. 
 You'll be handed over to Special Branch. 
 So who are you? 
 My name's Foyle. 
 I'm a policeman. Who are you? 
 My name is Hans Maier. 
 I'm from Holland. I'm Dutch. 
 Oh. How'd you get here? 
 I came by boat, from France. 
 On your own? 
 Yes. 
 I find that very hard to believe. 
 Even so, it happens to be true. 
 You were that desperate to escape German occupation? 
 Yes. 
 It's my information that you got a signal from the coast, which would sort of imply that you didn't act alone. 
 There was no signal. 
 Where's the boat you came in? 
 I don't know. 
 I left it on the beach. 
 Well, Mr Maier, as I said, there's nothing I can do for you. 
 But if you're a genuine refugee you'll be taken care of. 
 But that's for other people to decide. 
 So you are a policeman. 
 Yes. 
 You investigate...murder in a time of war? 
 When I have to. 
 Well, Detective Chief Superintendent? 
 Well, he claims to be a Dutch refugee. 
 Do you think he's a German spy? 
 If so he's ill prepared and ill-equipped. 
 Seems his mission was put together without any knowledge of this country. Hope they're all like that. 
 The military police are on their way. 
 He claims to have come by boat and says he's left it on the beach. 
 I don't want to tell you your job - 
 I've already given the order, Mr Foyle. They've been out for the past hour. 
 Hey, lads. Over here. 
 I've seen him before. 
 A Mrs Richard Hunter reported her husband missing this morning. 
 Richard Hunter mean anything? 
 Not the name. 
 But I know the face. 
 Found with a gun in his hand, two bullets missing from the chamber, one in his head. 
 Looks like a suicide. 
 Anything in his pockets? 
 No identification. Just cigarettes, matches, a few coins. 
 And this. 
 No serial number. 
 No markings on the key at all. 
 It's an old-fashioned design so we may have trouble finding out what it opens. 
 On top of all this we've got this German spy business. 
 Have they found his boat yet? 
 Yes, but not on the same beach. 
 That's Romney Point. 
 That's the Redmund House, the Lewes house. 
 This is where the body was found, That's where the boat was found. 
 How did they know it was his boat? 
 Found a suitcase with a compass, maps, spare clothes... 
 I know where I've seen him. 
 It was at the house. 
 Which house, sir? 
 Arthur Lewes's house, where I was having dinner. 
 The problem is... a body has been found on the beach. 
 Apparent suicide. 
 A man called Richard Hunter. 
 Richard Hunter? 
 He was here last night. 
 He's not dead, is he? 
 Yes. His wife identified the body a short while ago. 
 Oh, poor man. 
 How do you know him? 
 Well... He used to come here from time to time. 
 He did odd jobs for us - plumbing and things. 
 Right. And last night he was here for? 
 Oh, that was to see me. 
 Yeah, it was just before you arrived. About seven o'clock. 
 Elizabeth told me he was at the front door and I went to meet him. 
 What did he want? 
 Well, he asked me for money. 
 Money? 
 'Fraid so. 
 Something I'm fairly used to, I'm afraid. 
 Whether it's old friends or strangers, people know I'm wealthy and assume, because I'm American I've got to be generous too. 
 How much did he want? 
 Well, we never got as far as figures. I told him to get lost. 
 Well, I... 
 I didn't even know why he was here, how he found out that I'm here. 
 That's my fault, I'm afraid. 
 There was a story in the local paper. 
 Did you say that he committed suicide? 
 Erm, yes. 
 It does seem to be the case. 
 Well, maybe I can enlighten you there a little. 
 This was a very desperate guy. 
 He had some kind of trouble. 
 A problem with his son, he said. 
 He needed the money for his son, not himself. 
 Gee. You know, I... 
 I'd hate to think that what I said to him drove him to take his life. 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 The beach where the body was found is this beach, below the house here. 
 Well, there's a path down the side of the cliff but it's too dangerous. 
 You get to it by the lane. 
 Wood Lane. 
 Yes. 
 It cuts through the woods by Doctor Redmund's house. 
 It's only a 10-minute walk to the sea. 
 Er, Mr Foyle? 
 I just wanted to mention to you that Mr Paige is here as a guest of the British Government. 
 Oh. Jolly good. 
 Should that be of interest to me? 
 It's my job to look after him, Mr Foyle. 
 Mr Paige has been involved in negotiations at the highest level and will be returning to the United States shortly. 
 In the meantime, I must ask you not to harass him. 
 In the same sort of way you're harassing me? 
 I'll do my best. 
 He wouldn't kill himself. 
 He couldn't kill himself. 
 He had things on his mind, I know. 
 He was moody. 
 But we've been married for so long. 
 If he was going to do anything like that he'd have told me. 
 Mrs Hunter, did your husband own a gun? 
 Yes. It was his dad's, from the war. 
 Is this his? 
 (SOBS) Oh! 
 That's his, yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Did he say anything about going up to Romney Point last night? 
 No. 
 He used to do jobs there but he never said anything. 
 He said he was going to the pub. 
 He went out but he came back half an hour later. 
 Speak to him? 
 No. He was only in the house for a minute, then went out again. 
 Did he ever mention a Mr Howard Paige? 
 I've never even heard of him. 
 He was upset. 
 He and Kenny had been arguing. 
 Oh. 
 About what? 
 Money. 
 That's all we ever argued about. 
 I've been offered a place. 
 De Havilland's. 
 They run an aeronautical school up in Hatfield. It's like college but it's all planes. 
 It's all I want to do. 
 And how long have you been living in Hastings, Mrs Hunter? 
 We moved down here when Kenny was still small. 
 Richard got a job at Lower Meads. 
 There's a factory there, making engineering components, cars, things like that. 
 And then he got ill. 
 And after that he set up on his own. 
 He opened a shop. 
 Yes, and he did odd jobs. 
 He got sick. Was he very ill? 
 It was his nerves. 
 You can speak to his doctor, Doctor Redmund. I have his address. 
 Is this his? 
 He carried that with him everywhere. 
 Never let it out of his sight. 
 What does this open? 
 There's a shed in the garden. 
 I used to come down here with him when I was a kid. 
 Thought it was an Aladdin's cave back then. 
 We were going to invent stuff. 
 Death rays and rockets. 
 My dad. 
 I was very proud of him. 
 So why did you want to leave? 
 Because it was all lies. 
 He never did anything down here. 
 He drank. 
 He kept a bottle under the table. 
 Gin, whisky, whatever he could get hold of. He sat here and he drank and he dreamed and he never did anything. 
 And in the end I couldn't wait to get away from him. 
 Why did your dad worry about you being in the AFS? 
 Maybe he thought I was going to get my fingers burnt. 
 What does it matter now, anyway? 
 He's killed himself. That's it. 
 Oh, Morton. 
 I've been looking for you. 
 What is it, Mr Dunning? 
 I've had the police in here, asking for you. 
 Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle, no less. What did he want? 
 He didn't tell me. 
 I'm only the editor. 
 Nobody tells me anything. 
 Maybe it's something to do with this. 
 It's quite a view. 
 On a clear day you can see France. 
 And send a signal if you feel inclined. 
 Could it have been someone from the house, sir? 
 Maybe, but this is not private land. 
 Anybody could have driven up here. 
 I'm afraid I can't tell you a great deal about Richard Hunter. 
 I was treating him for a nervous condition. 
 He was in and out of the surgery over the years. 
 He was an alcoholic. 
 That's not easy these days, with spirits harder to come by. 
 And he wasn't from here originally? 
 No, he was from the north, I think. 
 York. Or was it Leeds? 
 He mentioned once that his father worked for a confectionary firm. 
 Both parents are dead. 
 I'm afraid that's about it. 
 Oh, sorry. I didn't know you had company. 
 Oh! Mr Foyle. 
 Mrs Redmund. 
 This is a surprise. 
 Mr Foyle's here on police business. 
 What business? 
 Something that happened last night. 
 You mean...the signals? 
 No. He's not here about that. 
 What makes you think I might be? 
 Well, people were talking this morning. 
 Signals in the night. 
 It's a load of nonsense. 
 Home Guard don't know what they're talking about. 
 Well, in fact they've caught a man who looks as if he came into the country last night by boat. 
 Really? 
 What incident were you referring to? 
 Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you, Mrs Redmund, that a man has been found shot dead on the beach. 
 He shot himself? 
 Seems so, yes. 
 Well, I can't say I'm surprised. 
 Richard Hunter was a wreck of a human being. 
 I don't think I've ever met anyone who had less reason to be alive. 
 Did you speak to him last night? 
 He was at the house? 
 Briefly, yes, before dinner. 
 It's not my habit to chat with patients, Mr Foyle, particularly ones like Richard Hunter. 
 I mean...he made a complete mess of his life. 
 It's all the more of a pity when you consider he'd been up at Oxford. 
 Had he really? 
 Mm. So he claimed. 
 Wouldn't think it, would you? 
 No, he told me once that he got a bursary or a grant from the confectionary firm that employed his father. 
 Well, they were wasting their money, because nothing came of it. 
 Would he have known Howard Paige, do you think? 
 I very much doubt it. 
 No. Oxford University back in the Twenties. 
 People like Paige and Hunter didn't mix. 
 People knew their place. 
 Know what I mean? 
 But these days everything's changed. 
 You can call me old-fashioned, if you like but I don't think it's a change for the better. 
 I imagine you're rather careful about the company you keep. 
 You're right. 
 And what did you make of Howard Paige last night? 
 Brash, opinionated. 
 But you were there, Mr Foyle. 
 Why do you need to ask me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm afraid Mr Foyle isn't here. 
 He asked to see me. 
 My name is Colin Morton. 
 I'm a photographer with the Eastbourne Chronicle. 
 He didn't say anything to me. 
 Look, it's important. 
 It just happens I was in Wood Lane last night in my car. 
 So where were you going, then? 
 I wasn't driving. 
 It's not easy to explain but I was sitting there and the point is I think I saw something. 
 And what was that? 
 I'd prefer to talk to Mr Foyle. 
 I've just told you, he's not here. 
 But I can pass on anything you want to say. 
 No, it's too important. 
 He knows where to find me. 
 Ask him to call. 
 If that's what you want, all right. 
 I'll put a note on his desk. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Mmm. This is really good, Sam. 
 You're not such a bad cook after all. 
 It's one of my father's recipes, coq-au-vin without the vin. 
 He's a teetotaller. 
 So what is in it? 
 Chicken, vegetables, and I used all the rest of the bacon, I'm afraid. 
 What, all of it? 
 That was the last of my ration. 
 Sorry. 
 Never mind. 
 So, how's the case going? 
 You are lucky, getting to rummage around all those dead bodies. 
 Well,...we're fairly sure it wasn't suicide but then that leaves the question, who'd want to kill Richard Hunter? 
 And why? 
 If his son was in the AFS and they were the ones doing the looting. 
 Well, you see, that's another mystery. Henry Jamieson. 
 He's guilty. I'm certain of it. 
 But at your landlady's house he took her coins and necklace but he left a valuable watch. Why? 
 Maybe Richard Hunter knew the answer. 
 He was going to tell and that's why he had to be silenced. 
 Have you managed to find anywhere yet? 
 You're not kicking me out? 
 No, no, not at all. 
 I like having you here. 
 Mr Foyle would have a fit if he found out! 
 Yes, I don't think he'd be entirely happy. 
 Well... I am looking. 
 [ JAZZ ON RADIO ] 
 I love this one. 
 Will you dance with me? 
 Dance with me! 
 No. 
 Don't be such a cold fish. 
 I've been bombed. I've lost my house, almost all my possessions and here I am, stuck with you. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Just one little dance. 
 All right, I'll have a go. 
 But I'm warning you,... 
 I was never much of a dancer. 
 That's just an excuse. 
 No, it's true, really. 
 I used to love going to dance halls. 
 As a trainee, we'd to go up to London. 
 Mayfair, Grosvenor... 
 Jane. 
 What are you doing? 
 Jane, this isn't what you think. 
 Jane. 
 Woman on radio : "Oh, sir, you are a caution..." 
 Man : You'll have to be quick. I'm due at a wedding ceremony at 11:30. 
 Very good, sir. 
 My wife and I had a very quiet wedding. The vicar had laryngitis. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 [ CRUNCH OF FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL ] 
 ..fire-watch duty at the depot. 
 Couldn't cope with the hours, sir. 
 One minute he'd be needing the dough, next he was flat as a pancake. 
 You don't know what I've been through. 
 Mr Morton? 
 Yeah? 
 Come with me. 
 What?! Who are you? 
 Take him. 
 How do you do, Mr Foyle? 
 How very good to meet you. 
 I tutored your son, you know. 
 Andrew. 
 How is he? 
 Well, thank you. 
 Last I heard, he was in Scotland. 
 No, he was posted to the south coast, not too far from me. 
 Oh, well, there's some mercy in that, I suppose. 
 I heard him speak once, in a debate. 
 "Modern patriotism is a false emotion." 
 He was very persuasive. 
 Then the moment the war began, he was gone. 
 Him and so many others. 
 Just boys, laughing boys. 
 Turned into men. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're not here because of him. 
 Well, the... the registrar told me that you also tutored a boy called Richard Hunter. 
 Hunter? 
 He was here in '22 on a bursary. 
 Studied physics, left with a first. 
 Yes, of course. Hunter. 
 Working-class boy from Yorkshire. 
 Harrogate, I think. 
 We didn't get too many of them back in the '20s. 
 Anything else you can tell me? 
 Oh, he was quiet, diligent, smoked a pipe. 
 Possible link with a Rhodes Scholar here at the same time, Howard Paige? 
 Oh, yes, of course. 
 Hunter and Paige. 
 Hunter and Paige. You should have mentioned him in the first place. 
 Most unlikely couple, but the two of them were involved in a minor scandal. 
 Four-seater Austin Seven. 
 They borrowed it from another student, and between them they took the whole thing apart, piece by piece. 
 You have to remember that this was the time when cars were quite a rarity. 
 Hm. 
 And it was...done as a joke? 
 No, no, no. 
 They put it back together again. 
 Good as new. They just wanted to look at it, see how it functioned. 
 The owner wasn't too pleased, though. 
 There was a quite a contretemps. 
 So...they were close friends? 
 No, I wouldn't say that. 
 The American boy was only here for a short time. 
 But that's one incident I certainly remember. 
 Mr Foyle is here again. He wants to have another word with you. 
 Frankly, I'm getting tired of this. 
 Do I have to talk to him? 
 I think it would probably be for the best. 
 Goddamn it, Bishop, I thought it was your job to protect me. 
 Do I need to protect you, Mr Paige? 
 Oh, no. No, of course not. 
 Just...getting tired of the way the guy's hounding me. 
 You know why I'm here. 
 You know the stakes we're playing. 
 Yes. 
 Well, maybe it's time somebody told him. 
 Ah, Mr Foyle. 
 Did you come to wish me bon voyage? 
 Well, um...not exactly. 
 I leave tomorrow, so maybe you should. 
 Is this still about the dead man on the beach? 
 Oh. That's an odd thing to say. 
 Well, that's what he is. 
 I mean it's an odd way to describe someone you knew. 
 You were at Oxford together. 
 I'd have mentioned Oxford. 
 It didn't seem relevant. 
 But I did tell you I knew him. 
 I have no recollection of that. 
 Yeah, we were in the other room there, talking, Arthur and Elizabeth were there. 
 Let's see...I was talking about Richard, how he'd asked me for money and I said, I told you, I was often approached by old friends. 
 Oh, right. Yes, I remember you saying you were approached by old friends and complete strangers. 
 You didn't specify which of the two he was, though. 
 Well, um...I can only apologise. 
 I surely didn't intend to mislead you, Mr Foyle. 
 Not that I think it makes an iota of difference. 
 No? 
 Oh, come on. I haven't been in England for 20 years. 
 Not since I was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. 
 Sure, I knew Richard then. 
 We got on, we had a good time. 
 It was a casual friendship. 
 There was something about a four-seater Austin Seven? 
 Oh, boy. 
 Oh, no. Don't tell me the law's finally caught up with me on that. 
 Yeah, we stole the car. 
 It was a joke. We took it apart, put it all back together again. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 To prove we could. 
 Look, Mr Foyle, the man I saw on that doorstep was a complete stranger to me. 
 I hadn't seen or heard from him for, what, quarter of a century? 
 I'm sorry I didn't make my connection with him clearer, but... 
 I can assure you that it wasn't intentional. 
 Paige can't have had anything to do with the death, can he, sir? 
 Why is that? 
 Well, he's not English. He hasn't been in England for ages, has he? 
 What reason could he possibly have? 
 Tired? 
 I didn't get much sleep last night, sir. 
 Still at your friend's? 
 I don't think so. 
 If you could stay awake till we get there, I'd be grateful. 
 Kenneth. 
 Mr Foyle. There's no-one here. 
 No, no, no. 
 It's you I wanted to talk to. 
 How are you? 
 I'm fine. 
 Must have been very hard, losing your dad. 
 Do you think he shot himself? 
 I don't know. 
 You see, if he didn't shoot himself, then somebody else did. 
 And there'd be a reason for that. 
 And it did cross my mind that it might have been you. 
 What?! 
 Why was he so very worried about you? 
 I already told you I don't know. 
 The very last thing he did was try to find the money to get you to aeronautical school. 
 Which might have been the reason he died. 
 I know you were disappointed in him, but there must have been a part of him you were fond of. 
 Maybe. 
 What do you know, that you're not telling me? 
 If I talk to you, then maybe I'll end up like my dad, with a bullet in my head! 
 I don't know anything about anything, all right? 
 You shouldn't come round here. 
 If you've got any questions, you should talk to Henry. 
 Do you want me to go after him, sir? 
 No, there's no point. 
 He's quite frightened. 
 Frightened? What of? 
 I'm sorry about last night. 
 Oh, Sam. Don't worry. 
 It wasn't your fault. I invited you. 
 Did your wife understand my situation? 
 Yes. Eventually. 
 Where did you go? 
 Oh, I found somewhere. 
 Good. 
 There's something odd here. 
 What? 
 Looks different. Sergeant! 
 Sir? 
 Anybody been in here? 
 No-one would come in without your say-so, Mr Foyle. 
 But I did look in while you were away, left a note on your desk. 
 Nothing wrong, is there? 
 Where's the note? 
 No, I haven't seen him. 
 And before you ask, he isn't at home. I sent someone round. 
 I need him. 
 I've got a local platoon of Home Guard demonstrating their prowess on roller skates, would you believe? 
 Fancy themselves as despatch racers. 
 I wanted a picture. 
 Would have been good for a laugh. 
 Why do you want him? 
 He came to the station to see me. 
 I wasn't there. 
 He said he had something important to tell me. 
 He should have told me first. 
 He said he may have seen something. 
 Mentioned he'd been parked in Wood Lane. Mean anything? 
 Colin told you that? 
 Any idea why he'd park in the middle of nowhere in the blackout? 
 As a matter of fact, I have. 
 Oh, there's plenty of them. 
 Coming out of London, Bristol, all the big cities. 
 They drive out every evening and sleep in the open. 
 Away from built-up areas. 
 Scared of the bombs. 
 He's a trekker? 
 Yes. 
 He isn't a coward. 
 Colin's a good man. 
 But...Oh, for heaven's sake, he was out 24 hours a day, photographing bombed-out houses. 
 People on the streets, stretchers, corpses. 
 Is it any wonder it got to him in the end? 
 Do you have his car registration number? 
 Well, he certainly seems to have left in a hurry. 
 Not of his own free will, it seems. 
 Why do you say that, sir? 
 Well, you tell me. 
 Oh. 
 I see. 
 He was dragged. 
 These are his footmarks, perhaps. 
 Hm. 
 But why? 
 Why do you think? 
 Morton knew something and somebody didn't want him to tell you. 
 This leads down to the beach where Richard Hunter was found. 
 Do you think this has something to do with the German spy? 
 He landed here the same night. 
 That was a mile and a half away. 
 How far to Romney House? 
 About ten minutes on foot. Is that where they sent the signals from? 
 There are only two houses up here at Romney Point. 
 It seems possible that they might have come from one of them. 
 Can I offer you anything? 
 No. No, thank you. 
 You said I could come and see you. 
 Yes. 
 It seems so strange, seeing so much of you suddenly, after such a long time. 
 How's the investigation? 
 Oh, it's coming along. 
 You don't think Mr Hunter killed himself, do you? 
 Do you think Mr Paige had something to do with it? 
 Well, it's...not impossible. 
 If America does come into the war, it'll be at least partly due to him. 
 He's terribly important, Arthur says. 
 Have you told Arthur that you're here? 
 No. He's in London. In chambers. 
 You know who killed that poor man, don't you? 
 Is this why you've come here, to talk about this case? 
 No. No, of course not. 
 I-I came to see you. 
 I-I felt so wretched, sitting at the dinner table, talking about the war and America, and that peculiar doctor going on about supplies. 
 When all I wanted, really, was to be alone with you. 
 Elizabeth. 
 How are you, Christopher? 
 I mean, are you happy? 
 Well, er... 
 ..we're at war. 
 And I do worry about Andrew. 
 I'm not happy. 
 I've been married to Arthur for 20 years. 
 It was our wedding anniversary a week ago. 
 He's been very kind to me. 
 He's a very kind man. 
 But I...I've never loved him. 
 Not even for a day. 
 Not the way I loved you. 
 There, I've said it. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I feel... 
 I sound like something out of Noel Coward. 
 And... you never did like his plays, did you? 
 I was so sorry when I heard about Rosalind, really I was. 
 I wanted to write. I tried, but all the time I kept thinking, after she died, maybe you and I...I hoped... 
 Shouldn't be doing this. 
 It was all far too long ago. 
 It was very different then. 
 Everything's different now. 
 This is a mistake, Elizabeth. 
 No. 
 I made the mistake years ago. 
 I know that now. 
 Can you forgive me? 
 There's nothing to forgive. 
 We were different people. 
 You asked me to marry you. 
 And when your father refused permission and you married Arthur instead, I understood the very difficult position you'd been placed in. 
 He...he gave me no choice. 
 You don't understand. 
 Your father understood perfectly well that a policeman's son was not good enough and I should never have asked. 
 I couldn't go against him, Christopher. You knew that. 
 I never said you should. 
 You've grown very hard. 
 Was it Rosalind dying that did that? 
 No. 
 Losing her changed nothing. 
 Marrying her changed everything. 
 But you've got a good husband and two wonderful sons. 
 But the truth is we should leave this exactly the way it is. I'm sorry. 
 I'm the one who's sorry. 
 You're right. I shouldn't have come. 
 I am so sorry, Christopher. 
 I want you to know that barely a day has gone by, in all these years, when I haven't been sorry. 
 Why don't you leave us alone, Mr Foyle? 
 You've searched the place once already. You found nothing. 
 Absolutely right, which is why we're going to search it again. 
 You were right about them being selective about what they took. 
 All the things that were stolen had the same thing in common. 
 Sir! 
 What was that, sir? 
 They were waterproof. 
 I've got it! 
 You know, I quite enjoyed that. 
 I haven't got anything to say to you. 
 Well, that doesn't surprise me. 
 You know, I regularly wonder why I do this job. 
 And then I come across somebody like you. 
 We are living in such evil times and the whole world seems to be sinking into some sort of mire, and as if Hitler wasn't enough, we've got the likes of you, who capitalise on other people's misery, who hurt them, make things worse for them when they're at their weakest. 
 And it's with the likes of you that this mire begins. 
 And it's some small consolation to know that I've helped clean up just a little of it. 
 You'll be charged under Defence Regulations 38A. 
 And I should warn you that you could be facing the death penalty. 
 What? 
 Malicious damage and larceny in war-damaged areas. 
 No. No, you can't hang me. 
 I mean...I wasn't doing nothing that anyone else isn't doing. 
 I mean... 
 Sir, I think I might have something for you. Yes? 
 I've been looking at the winds and currents the night that Hunter died. 
 Yes? 
 This is Romney Point. Romney House here and Wood lane down here. 
 And this is the beach, where the rowing boat was found. 
 The Germans drop off a boat, and the nearest landing point is this beach. 
 Where the body was found? 
 Yes. 
 But there was a strong current that night, heading west. 
 And from what I've been told, a boat would have had trouble getting into the coast anywhere. 
 Especially if there was just one man. 
 And no-one else has been caught. 
 So it would have been hard work, he'd have been swept somewhere out to the west. 
 Which is where he landed. 
 I wonder whether the German spy might have had something to do with Hunter's death. 
 I don't know about that, but if he's sitting in the boat off the coast, we might at least have a witness. 
 Good luck, sir. What do we do if they don't let you out again? 
 Well, you can take over. 
 I'm sorry, Mr Foyle, but what you're asking is out of the question. 
 There's absolutely no way I can allow you to see Maier without the necessary authorisation. 
 Oh. 
 How long are you going to keep him here? 
 Until Military Intelligence decide what to do with him. 
 And what are the options? 
 It's possible they'll turn him and try to use him against the Germans. 
 Or shoot him? 
 I'm afraid that's much more likely to be the case. 
 Do you really believe that this man may have been witness to a murder? 
 Yes, very possible. 
 Look, Mr Foyle, even if I were to turn a blind eye and let you in, what makes you think Maier would co-operate? 
 He's an enemy agent. 
 Richard Hunter was not a casualty of war. 
 Maier and I have met before. 
 And? 
 Well, enemy agent or whatever, he did strike me as being reasonably civilised. 
 Meaning what, exactly? 
 Well, he's risked his life for his country. 
 He was simply doing his duty as he saw it. 
 And now he's got nothing left to lose. 
 Precisely, but more importantly, at our first meeting, he asked me if I investigated murder in a time of war. 
 Which didn't mean very much to me at the time, but then, of course, we hadn't found the body. Yes. 
 Odd. 
 Ten minutes alone with him? 
 This is totally contrary to regulations. 
 All right. Ten minutes. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Of course I remember you. 
 It is Mr Foyle, is it not? 
 The policeman. 
 Are they treating you well? 
 I know they are going to kill me. 
 I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do to help you. 
 Then why are you here? 
 Because I hoped you could help ME. 
 You want me to help you? 
 Yes. 
 There's an expression that you use... 
 Um... 
 I'm lost for words. 
 How do you imagine I could possibly help you? 
 Well, it concerns what you saw the night you arrived in England. 
 What makes you think I would wish to help you? 
 That's a very good question. 
 You have a very good answer? 
 No. I do know that you arrived by U-boat, and that you're German and not Dutch, and as such we are enemies so I quite understand why you'd feel unwilling to help. 
 I certainly don't expect it. 
 But what you saw, what I believe you saw, is nothing to do with our countries being at war. 
 It's murder. 
 Maybe we can help each other. 
 You will be one of the last people to see me alive. 
 I would like you to get a message to my family. 
 What message is that? 
 What sort of message can a man in my position give? 
 Only that...I said goodbye, and that I was thinking of them at the end. 
 My mother is 80 years old. 
 She may not even survive the war. 
 And it will not be easy to find her. 
 But I will accept your word that you will try. 
 How will I find her? 
 We live in Alfeld. 
 It's a town south of Hanover. 
 My mother's family name is Hartman. 
 Hartman? 
 It may help you find her. 
 Right. 
 And now... 
 I will tell you what I heard and what I saw. 
 I had to work hard to reach the shore. 
 There was a tide and it was taking me to the west. 
 Nobody had warned me of this. 
 And after about five minutes, I heard a shot. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 It was a single shot, fired from a gun. I also heard breaking glass. 
 My first thought was that someone was firing at me, but then I realised this was not the case. 
 I heard a man. 
 He was far away but the night was still and the sound carried. 
 It seemed to me the man who had been shot was in pain. 
 He was...sobbing. 
 I could see very little in the darkness but there were two men there, on the beach. 
 One man was standing, the other was kneeling. 
 Then there was a second shot. 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 The man who was standing had shot the man who was kneeling. 
 He then ran away. 
 By this time, my boat had drifted some distance and I began to row. 
 How long between the two shots? 
 Less than one minute. 
 And that is all I can tell you, Mr Foyle. 
 Thank you. 
 And you will speak one day with my family? 
 I will. 
 Thank you. 
 Auf wiedersehen. 
 I hope you realise I could be shot for this. 
 This isn't a hotel, you know. 
 It's very kind of you, sergeant. 
 So long as you don't mention it to Mr Foyle. He'd hit the bloody roof. 
 I'm quite good at keeping my living arrangements a secret from Mr Foyle. 
 So, do you want the door locking? 
 No, thank you. 
 Just get yourself a billet. 
 And the sooner, the better. 
 The...er... The man arrested as a spy on the coast the other night is a German called Hans Maier. 
 Yes? 
 I met him today. 
 Yes? 
 He's a very brave man, in many ways. 
 He's acutely aware of the situation he's in. 
 And of what's likely to happen to him. 
 What will happen to him? 
 He'll very probably be executed, Mrs Redmund. 
 He asked me to get a message to his family. 
 To say goodbye and to tell them that he loved them and that he was thinking of them at the end. 
 I don't understand why you're telling us all this. 
 Don't you? 
 Do you? 
 To make sure that I was able to find his mother, to deliver the message, he told me that she lived in Alfeld and that her maiden name was Hartman. 
 It's just as well that I'm the only person with this information. 
 What do you mean, Mr Foyle? 
 Well, your maiden name is Hartman, Mrs Redmund. 
 Your father's sister emigrated to Germany just before the last war. 
 So you and Hans are cousins. 
 Eve? 
 Yes. 
 I haven't seen the family for many years. 
 Hans and I used to play together. 
 I had no knowledge that he was coming to this country. 
 I knew nothing. 
 Just a coincidence, then, that of all the miles of British coastline he could have chosen he landed just along the beach from the house from which the Home Guard saw the signal being made and where you were having dinner. 
 Mr Foyle, I think you should be very careful what you're saying. 
 If you're implying that my wife - 
 No, no. Not at all. 
 As a matter of fact, I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever that you did slip out of the Lewes's house and made the signal to the submarine. 
 If I did, I'd have to arrest you. 
 You have my name. 
 Circumstantial. 
 As I said, he's a very brave man and I'm very grateful to him for the information he's given me about the death of Richard Hunter. 
 He's in jail. He was arrested too quickly to do anyone any harm, and as far as I'm concerned, how he got here and who helped him is none of my business. 
 I hope you're able to pass the message on to his mother. 
 I'll see myself out. 
 I knew. 
 What? 
 I knew it was you. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 It was just before dinner was served. 
 You disappeared. 
 You were gone for about ten minutes. 
 I wondered, at the time. 
 Later, I retraced your steps to the edge of the cliff. 
 I knew it was you. 
 Did...Hans contact you? 
 Tell me the truth. 
 It wasn't Hans. 
 It was just a voice on the telephone. 
 They told me he was coming and what they wanted me to do. 
 I didn't know what to do, Alan. 
 I just wanted him to arrive safely. 
 You just wanted him to arrive safely? 
 Do you know what you are? 
 Do you know what that makes you? 
 He's my family! 
 You are a traitor! No! 
 Foyle should have arrested you! 
 I should call him back! 
 Well, why don't you? 
 Because you're my wife! 
 Argh! 
 I will never speak to you again. 
 I don't care if you stay or if you go. 
 As far as I'm concerned, you don't exist. 
 If I come into a room, I want you to leave it. 
 If you try to speak to me, I'll walk out. 
 You can sleep in the spare room. 
 You can prepare your own meals, and you can eat them alone. 
 I want nothing more to do with you. 
 Now get out. 
 Alan... 
 Maier : It was a single shot, fired from a gun. 
 I also heard breaking glass. 
 Sir? 
 Sam. 
 You're looking...tired. 
 Are you not sleeping? 
 Not a great deal. 
 I've got a rather hard bed. 
 You all right to drive? 
 Absolutely. 
 Sit down. 
 I've just got to finish this. 
 What is it? 
 An arrest report. 
 Where did you get this from? 
 It was found in Richard Hunter's pocket. 
 It's the key to his garden shed. 
 Was he a mechanic? 
 Yes. 
 Why do you ask? 
 This fob - it's a cone from a gearbox, isn't it? 
 Is it? 
 There's an inner cone and an outer cone. 
 They connect and that's what changes the speed. 
 When I was in the MTC we had to strip down engines all the time. 
 I could never put them back together, but I did learn about the synchro-mesh gearbox. 
 The synchro-mesh gearbox. 
 Your flight leaves at 1900 hours from here to Lisbon and over to Washington. 
 I'm afraid it's going to be a bumpy ride. 
 Oh. Weather? 
 Storms over the Atlantic. 
 I don't care about that. 
 I just want to get home. 
 What the hell is...? 
 It's Foyle. 
 Mr Foyle. You have a habit of turning up at unexpected times. 
 I'm afraid I can't stop for a chat. 
 If you don't mind, I have a plane to catch. 
 There's no rush, Mr Paige. 
 The plane's not going anywhere, and neither are you. 
 Why's that? 
 Because I'm arresting you for the murder of Richard Hunter. 
 You're not being serious, are you? 
 And quite possibly you as well, Mr Bishop, IF that's your name, as an accessory. 
 What the hell's going on here? 
 Just tell him to get out of the way. 
 Does your jurisdiction go as far as that? 
 Bishop! 
 Let's hear what he has to say. 
 This is...unbelievable. 
 Have you forgotten who I am, Mr Foyle? 
 I think you know why I'm here. 
 It's no longer relevant, Mr Paige. 
 So I killed Richard Hunter? 
 Why? 
 Because about 20 years ago, he invented a system of cones on a gear wheel. 
 A revolutionary idea, which formed the basis of what became known as the synchro-mesh gear system. 
 He invented it, you stole it. 
 You patented it in America two years later and made a fortune out of it. 
 Do you want me to go on? 
 No. No, not really. 
 I'd like to hear the rest of it. 
 Richard Hunter was a brilliant student with a bursary from a highly-respected British company. 
 Stealing his idea from him reduced him to a broken alcoholic failure. 
 You killed him twice, Mr Paige. 
 I did not kill Richard Hunter. 
 If you want the truth, it was Hunter that wanted to kill me. 
 Absolutely true, which is why he had the gun with him when he came to the house. 
 He'd imagined there was nothing he could do. You were in America. 
 When he saw your name in the paper and realised you were in Hastings, he knew exactly what he was going to do. 
 He was going to get money out of you and shoot you if he couldn't. 
 Must have been quite a shock for you, setting eyes on him again. 
 Especially in this place. 
 Yeah, that was certainly true. 
 What wasn't true is that you refused to meet him. 
 You arranged to see him on the beach, after dinner. 
 I saw him leaving the house. 
 He threatened you, didn't he? 
 You know what I want. 
 I want money. 
 It was my idea and you took it from me. 
 Come on, Richard. 
 You know that's not true. 
 You helped me, sure. 
 But I'm the one had to make it work. 
 No, no, no. 
 That's not true, either. 
 If it hadn't been for me, you'd have been nothing. 
 Forgive me, but I'd have said you're the one who's nothing. 
 Yeah, but I mean my son could be something. 
 With your money, he could get an apprenticeship. 
 He could have his chance. 
 You owe me. 
 I don't owe you anything. 
 It was my idea. 
 You took it from me. 
 You said you were going to get the backing. 
 You never answered my letters. 
 You pretended I didn't exist. 
 Put the gun down. 
 Foyle : He had the gun. 
 You're not going to use it. 
 But you're a risk-taker, Mr Paige. 
 You knew he couldn't kill. 
 Put it down. 
 And you were right. 
 Aaaargh! 
 [ GUNSHOT ] 
 I'm going to do for you, Paige. 
 I'm going to tell everybody. 
 I should have told everybody years ago. 
 I'm going to tell the world what you did to me. 
 He couldn't kill - but you could. 
 You knew exactly what it would look like. 
 A wreck of a man, found dead on a deserted beach with his own gun. 
 A risk to shoot him, yes. 
 A bigger one to let him live? 
 I don't think so, Mr Paige. 
 He couldn't have been any trouble to you. 
 You took the wrong one. 
 You have a fine imagination, Mr Foyle. 
 But if you'll forgive me for pointing this out, you can't prove a single word you've said. 
 As a matter of fact, I can. 
 There's a witness. 
 In fact, there are two. 
 Two witnesses? 
 One was in a boat, the other was in a car in Wood Lane, the track you took from Romney House. 
 You know about him, don't you? 
 What? 
 Colin Morton. 
 He's what's known as a trekker. 
 Trekkers sleep in their cars, away from built-up areas to escape the bombing. 
 He saw you. 
 And he'll testify against you. 
 And it was you who abducted him. 
 I arrested him, yes. 
 And you're Military Intelligence? 
 Doesn't matter what he is. 
 And I don't give a damn about your deductions, Mr Foyle. 
 You can't arrest me. 
 Tell him. 
 Yes, I'm afraid Mr Paige is right. 
 I outrank you, Mr Foyle. 
 May I ask you to come with me? 
 I'm very sorry I can't let you arrest him. 
 Why? 
 Because of 50 ships, Mr Foyle. 
 Out-of-date rusting ships, with appalling armaments and accommodation. 
 Ships we may never actually use. 
 American ships? 
 Yes. 
 We need the Americans, Mr Foyle. 
 They're the best friends we have. 
 If we can't persuade them to provide us with arms, food, ammunition and all the rest of it, we will not survive. 
 Why do we need Howard Paige? 
 Whatever else he is, Paige is a great supporter of this country. 
 American allies have made a huge difference. 
 They've brokered a deal that will be the start of many more. 
 They've created a lifeline that could last the entire war. 
 Starting with 50 ships? 
 They're symbolic. Only Americans understand their significance. 
 They get very emotional about it, giving away a piece of their navy to a foreign country. 
 They even had to change their own laws to make it possible. 
 But the point is, it opens the floodgates. 
 By this one commitment, they'll show the world whose side they're on. 
 America will become the arsenal of democracy, Mr Foyle. 
 Nothing less. 
 Arresting him would compromise this? 
 It would destroy it. 
 The American allies would lose all credibility. 
 The scandal would have repercussions you can't begin to imagine, the ships might not even sail. 
 This isn't the first time you've crossed military intelligence. 
 I hope you understand that the actions I've taken have been forced on me and not taken lightly. 
 You mean lying on his behalf, searching my office, arresting Colin Morton for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
 Mr Morton is in Whitehall being interviewed. 
 And you'll go on interviewing him, until Paige is out of the country. 
 I don't like this any more than you do, Mr Foyle. 
 The man is a killer and he should be hanged. 
 But right now, you can draw a direct line between Howard Paige and the outcome of this war. 
 Are you planning to arrest me? 
 I hope you won't make that necessary. 
 And what am I going to tell Richard Hunter's widow and his son? 
 You could tell them that he was a casualty of the war. 
 And if I don't go along with all this? 
 You're an intelligent, capable man. 
 I am sure you will bring yourself to see things from our point of view. 
 I want to see him. 
 Why? 
 Well, I'd love to say goodbye. 
 Mr Paige. 
 Mr Foyle. 
 I really hope this is a final goodbye. 
 Not at all. Only temporary. 
 You sound like a sore loser. 
 You know what the French say? 
 C'est la guerre. 
 Precisely, Mr Paige. 
 It's the war. 
 And no war has lasted forever and neither will this. 
 A year, maybe ten, but it will end. 
 And when it does, Mr Paige, you will still be a thief, a liar, and a murderer, and I will not have forgotten. 
 And wherever you are, I will find you. 
 You're not escaping justice, merely postponing it. 
 Au revoir. 
 Sam? 
 Sir. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, it's a long story, really. 
 You'd be amazed how many guest houses and hotels are full. 
 I've spoken to the billeting officer, and there isn't anything. 
 You have nowhere to live? 
 The long and short of it is I've ended up here. 
 You can't sleep here. 
 It's not too bad. 
 The mattress is a bit hard. 
 It's not really a mattress, it's more of a sort of...plank. 
 For God's sake... 
 Look, it won't bother me if it doesn't bother you. 
 You can use the back room at my house. 
 Andrew isn't there. Just until you get yourself sorted - if you like. 
 Could I, sir? Are you sure? 
 Yes, yes. 
 But do me a favour, don't mention it to the others. 
 They really wouldn't approve. 
 No. 
 I'd be very discreet. 
 Good. Come on. 
 Have you had dinner, sir? 
 No. Why? 
 Well, I could cook for you, if you like. 
 Well, that's very decent of you. 
 I don't mind. 
 Do you like coq au vin? 
 See if you can keep up this time, Foyle. 
 That's France straight ahead. 
 Try not to get lost. 
 Help! 
 There's a bomb. 
 There's a what? 
 Are you up for this? 
 You bet I am!
