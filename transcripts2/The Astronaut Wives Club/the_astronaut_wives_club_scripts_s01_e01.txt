 Announcer :  We have liftoff. The clock has started. 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Man : Mrs. Shepard? Mrs. Shepard? 
 And there he goes. 
 Our cameras have lost visual contact with the capsule, but we are getting constant updates from inside mission control. 
 So far, all has gone well... Max : Mrs. Shepard, any words you'd like me to record for our readers at  Life? ...But, of course, the most dangerous leg of the journey still lies ahead. Mrs. Shepard? As astronaut Shepard leaves the earth's atmosphere, we wait for news of his safe re-entry. [Telephones ringing] [Indistinct conversations] [Indistinct conversation] Alan. Hey, Louise. Mr. Donlon from NASA called. There was no answer here. I thought you'd want to know right away. Thanks. Alan : Hey. Don't you want to hear what he has to say? Yes, sir. I understand. I... [Sighs] Thank you. Goodbye. [Sighing] I got it. Oh! [Laughs] [Squeals] You're going to be an astronaut. [Laughs] Man :  A red moon shines over the United States of America. The Russians have launched the first artificial earth satellite, taking photos, recording conversations, even delivering a nuclear bomb. Who knows what this eye in the sky is capable of? [Beep]  The United States attempts to launch a rocket carrying its own satellite. Let's dub this one "kaputnik." And this one "stayputnik." Meanwhile, as the Russian dog Laika becomes the first canine in space, Eisenhower vows that the U.S. will put men into orbit. But who, how, and when? Today, we are introducing to you and to the world these seven men, who have been selected to begin training for orbital space flight. These men, or the nation's project Mercury astronauts... [Camera shutters clicking] - ...Are here after a long series of evaluations which told our medical consultants and scientists of their superb adaptability for their upcoming flight. Which one of these men will be first to orbit the earth? I cannot tell you. They do not know themselves. [Laughter] [Big band music playing] [Indistinct conversations] NASA's hosting this? No,  Life  magazine. They got our story exclusive. Honor to meet you, Mr. Shepard. Hello. Man : Hello, Alan. It's an honor. I guess that's a big deal. Man : Commander Shepard. [Camera shutters clicking] [All talking] Seven military families becoming American royalty. That's the Mercury story. Now we need the wives. Hello. Nice to see you. A pleasure, sir. You work for NASA. I thought  you  were gonna tell them. It would be better coming from you. They're not gonna want to do it. It invades their privacy. It subjects their families to public scrutiny. Okay, maybe it won't be better coming from you. Don't say any of that. Be positive. Sell the vision. You're a writer. I'm a journalist. I deal with facts. Here's a fact. This is a big opportunity for you. Opportunity? I'm gonna be the ghostwriter for a bunch of wives. They couldn't love you more. I don't know why they even bothered to have six others. [Chuckles] Man : Mrs. Carpenter, over here. Man #2 : Mr. Carpenter? Lieutenant Carpenter. Lieutenant? [Camera shutter clicks] [Distorted conversations] Scott : Alan, hey. Meet my wife. Rene. Rhymes with "peachy keen." [Chuckles] Louise. Rhymes with "Louise." [Chuckles] I love your dress.  Tres chic. And yours. Tres pink. [Chuckles] Excuse us. Nice to meet you. Duncan : Look, a lot of important people need this to work, including the president. Johnson and Kennedy are all over Ike, saying he blew it with  Sputnik. They're using it as a platform to attack his handling of the entire cold war. Eisenhower's older than the automobile. He's not gonna win us the race for space. Get those ladies on board. Alan : This is John Glenn. This is my wife, Louise. And this is Annie. So nice to meet you. Annie was just telling me how excited she was to meet all the other wives, weren't you, dear? Well, I look forward to it. We'll catch up later. No, you don't. No, I don't. I'm about to be forced into bridge and bake sales with a bunch of wives. Hard to say who's facing the bigger challenge. [Laughs] That's Gordo Cooper. Guy's on 24 hours a day. He's a hell of a test pilot. Don't think I've seen you in a dress since our wedding. Well, you try flying a plane in a petticoat. Just shut up and keep smiling. [Laughs] Are those pantyhose? You know that's not part of the deal. Love you, hon! Love you more. [Scoffs] I can't be away from him for even five minutes. Commander. Deke. This is my wife, Louise. How do you do? Pleasure. Hey, Al. [Buzzer] See? [Laughs] That's Wally. Pleasure. So nice to meet you. Hey, come on. I hear some ambassador's handing out Cubans. Funny every time. You'll be all right? Peachy keen. [Big band music continues] Here we are, boys. Moving up in the world. You guys, huh? Huh? [Laughter] How about that, yeah? [Laughter] Hi. I'm Betty Grissom, Gus' wife. Louise Shepard. Man : Champagne? I didn't even have champagne at my wedding. [Song ends] [Cheers and applause] So, there I was at 4:00 in the morning, typing a letter for MacArthur in slippers and a robe, and I didn't make one mistake. [Chuckles] Well, that is a great story. And now, was this in Germany where you met Deke? It was Japan, before Deke. Overseas and unmarried. That must have been an adventure. [Clears throat] I'm sorry, are we in your way? Louise Shepard. Hi. I'm Trudy Cooper. This is Marge Slayton. Our husbands were at Edwards together, the flight-test center. Jo. Schirra. Wally's wife. Buzz-buzz. [Laughs] Oh. We call him jolly Wally, but he's not funny. [Laughs] You're Gordo's wife. Alan tells me he's the real competition. Oh. [Laughs] Both : Hmm. Gordo has no competition. I'm afraid you're quite mistaken. Hi. Hi. Hi. Gordo says Alan is a desk jockey. Louise : Alan's got a desk at fleet command because he's on track to become an admiral. Gordo doesn't care about rank, just hours. He's flown 2,300 of them. Alan's got 3,600. Well, what about John Glenn? Now, he flew across the country at supersonic speed... I think that's amazing. He's not even your husband. I know. Well, nothing against my Wally, but I think John will be up first. Oh, where is Annie? She's the wife I want to meet. I'm not sure about that one. She didn't even say hi. Hi! Jo Schirra. Louise : Look, our husbands all want to go up first. It's our job to help them get what they want. Oh, I don't think of it as a job. I'm Scott's wife, not his employee. Honey, every girl works for a living. Excuse me? I'm a mother of four, and I've attended college. Ladies. I see you've met. I'm Max Kaplan, reporter.  Life  magazine. [All murmur] Greetings, astro wives. Gosh. Don't you just love the sound of that? - I, um... I thought we could get to know each other a little better. Maybe I can explain the deal. Oh, we know the deal. $100,000 life-insurance policy and half a million dollars for the magazine's exclusive story rights, split seven ways. If you ask me, I think you're overpaying to hear the inner thoughts of a bunch of rocket jockeys. That would be a lot of money if it was only their thoughts, but it's all of you. We'd be in the magazine? Front and center. Rene : Well, our husbands are the heroes. It wouldn't be right to step into their limelight. Would it? I wouldn't ask if it was just for the money or the perks that come with fame, and, yes, there are some good ones, but... I will ask you to do it for America. NASA's determined to win this space race with the Russians... In the air and in the press. Wives and children put a friendly face on things. Baseball, apple pie... Astronauts. Sounds like we're propaganda. Who's to say that putting your best foot forward wouldn't be a real factor in your husband's success? Besides, it's not like you ladies have a lot of bad habits or big secrets. Of course not. We're just a bunch of housewives. [Laughter in distance] Well, if it benefits my husband, I'm in. Me, too. We're all in. [Chuckles] [Indistinct conversations] Good to see you, Mrs. Shepard. You're early. Always. Where do you want me to stand? Do I have lipstick on my teeth? No. You're okay. It's been a while since I've had my picture taken. I'm more worried about the interview. Well, when somebody asks me something I don't want to answer, I just bat my eyes and say, "sorry, that's classified." Well, if NASA only wants family men with model marriages, that's exactly what they're gonna get from the Coopers. Gordo may be arrogant and infuriating... That's why they call them ass-tronauts. ...but he deserves to be here. No one needs to know the truth. Well, there's nothing in "The Navy Wife" about what to wear on the cover of a national magazine, so I just went with pearls and new white shoes. Uh, Mrs. Schirra, can you...? That's my Bible, "The Navy Wife." Annie! Hi! Come stand by me. Trudy : Who knows? If I play nice now, maybe one day it'll be me going into space. [Scoffs] Darling, Gordo may let you put-put around in that bonanza and race other girls in a powder puff derby, but pigs will fly in space before a woman does. Pigs  have  flown in space. Well, mice and rabbits. And dogs. Chimps, fruit flies. [Chuckles] What? It's our time. Ladies. Marge. Hello. Looks like I'm fashionably late. Louise : The... The memo said a... A pastel shirtwaist dress. Oh, well, they're NASA, not Christian Dior. I'm just doing my job. ♪ Pack your bags and throw them out the window ♪ 
♪ the world's about to blow ♪ 
♪ and I'm about to lose my head ♪ Man : Magazine covers, photo shoots, and talk shows. Whichever man is first in space, making history means making headlines for America's astro family. [Vocalizing] Duncan : Vroom. We've got seven, all matching. [Laughs] My very own car? Well, that's something. Louise : It is. Thank you. Rene : Well, that's certainly very generous, but I thought that we would be choosing a car that expresses our... Unique personalities. NASA thinks  this  sends the right message. There's lots of room for kids, groceries, dogs, if you have one. If you don't have one, you should think about getting one. People love dogs. Marge has a dog. But he's German. They're renaming this color... "Moon glow." Marge : Well, it's better than "toilet bowl," which is what I was getting off of it. But free is free. What do the guys get? [Engine revs] [Tires screech] Come on, slick! [Laughs] Whoo! Oh, you're a cheat! [Laughter] ♪ wake up ♪ I got it! What are you doing? I won. ♪ It's a beautiful morning ♪ The race was to the water! ♪ Honey ♪ Whoo! ♪ while the stars are still shining ♪ Nice car. ♪ Wake up ♪ Hi. Hi. [Indistinct shouting] ♪ Would you like to go with me ♪

♪ oh, mama ♪ 
♪ I want to go surfing ♪ 
♪ oh, mama ♪ You want some corn? ♪ I don't care about nothing ♪ Ambrosia salad? Ooh. Mrs. Slayton's place looks good, considering there's no man around. Mr. Kaplan, our husbands are military test pilots, always away, always risking their lives. The last thing I want Gus to do when he comes home is mow the lawn. ♪ There's a new kid in town ♪ Come on, hurry up. ♪ Honey ♪ Out of the car. ♪ He's moving into the big house ♪ Come on. Sorry. I'm late. I know. ♪ Remember ♪ But I matched my outfit to the dessert! [Laughs] ♪ when I was so very hopeless ♪ We should get a picture of that. Oh, go on.

[Laughs] ♪ oh, mama ♪ [Camera shutter clicks] ♪ I want to go surfing ♪ 
♪ oh, mama ♪ 
♪ I don't care about nothing ♪ [Camera shutter clicks] Looks good. Is that a family recipe? [Children playing] Yes. [Laughter] Girls. Those are Mrs. Slayton's. [Camera shutter clicking] Those aren't playthings. Kent said we could. Oh, Kent is a baby. Would you mind going into the yard? Okay. Take this off. Put them back carefully. Oh. Who's..."P-V-T J. Flannigan"? I think this stuff belongs to his wife. What's going on in here? I'm so sorry. They were just playing. I gave them heck as soon as I saw. What did mommy tell you? These aren't toys. These are beautiful. So are you in this photo. Thank you. I won't say anything. Say whatever you want. I doubt it'll make a difference. A difference? Have you seen the latest pictures? Annie drives the boat while John water-skis. It's adorable. And Gordo and Trudy, young and sexy with each other. Oh, and then there's Rene. Down-home Betty. Jo, the admiral's daughter. And you... perfect, poised lady Louise. How do I compete with that? Let me help you. It has to be done a certain way. Oh, yeah. Whoo! Gordo : This is the first time we're sending up a rocket with a Mercury capsule on top. It they're sending up the capsule, then a manned launch will be next. Whoo! You mean a Gordo'd launch, 'cause that man is gonna be me. [Laughs] Oh... Take me with you. Might be a little tight in the capsule. Not that I would mind. I can't believe I'm here with an astronaut. I went to the beach and met superman. Superman? I don't wear tights. [Chuckles] Be proud of me, Trude. I been working hard, staying out of trouble. Hold on a second. Alan : You've got a double. I've got two singles. You mind switching rooms? It's not easy being a superhero. It's not. I'm gonna help him relax. We'll be back. Hey, Trude? [Dial tone] [Laughter] [Indistinct shouting] [Telephone rings] Hello. Hi, Mr. Porter, this is Trudy Cooper. Oh, hello, Mrs. Cooper. I thought it would be great if the wives came down to the Cape for the Mercury atlas test launch coming up. Yeah, sure, that would make a nice picture. The ladies on the beach. Oh, and we'd like it to be a surprise for the guys. Sure, why not? Thanks. 
 
 [Cults' "Bad Things" plays] ♪ Bad things happen to the people you love ♪ I can't wait to see the look on Gordo's face. Oh, this humidity is already killing me. Let's go find the guys. Is there a party happening? I don't... know. [Indistinct conversations] What the h-e double hockey sticks? Rene : Oh, my gosh. There's John and Scott. Hi, girls. How you doing, girls? Oh. Ha ha. Uh... [Laughter] Trudy : Working hard? Hon! Hi. Look who's here. [Conversations continue] I didn't know you were coming. Yeah, we wanted to surprise you. I think we succeeded. For me? I'm touched. Mwah. We had it out on the river. The water was a little choppy, and everybody was spilling their drinks. Mm-hmm. [Chuckling] It was Wally's idea. [Hatch opens] I'm gonna go for a drink. All right? Janice : All right. Woman : Don't fall in. Darling, hi! Woman : Cheers. Woman #2 : Whoo! Cheers! I'm going to unpack. I'll take another. It's been a long day. Trudy : If Louise lets Alan and that... Cape cookie get away with it, what message does it send to the other guys? As mad as she may be, she'd never take away Alan's shot. Never mind raising those girls on her own, getting some sort of job... As what? Louise is too damn smart to get divorced. No offense. Why would Trudy take offense? Marge. S... [Sighs] When Gordo volunteered, I was already filing the papers. Technically, the divorce wasn't final, so he didn't exactly lie, but... I'm only back for his career. Gordo groomed the neighbor's poodle. [Laughs] [Chuckles] It's not funny. He cheated, Marge. He is a cheater. I am sorry, but life is long, and that man of yours is beautiful. Forget the roundheel back in California. Getting some is the best thing about being married. What he did I will never forgive, or forget. [Water splashing] Man : Mrs. Glenn. I-I'm with the  Sun. There's, uh, speculation your husband's going to be picked to man the first Mercury flight. Any, uh... Any comment? [Chuckles] Just a word or two, come on. What? Hey. [Scoffs] Don't be rude. Or, on second thought, go right ahead. I can run with that story, too. Maybe the world should know that America's sweetheart is actually sour. No, I... I... d-but... D-d-d-d-d-d... D-d-d... d-d-d-d-d... D-don't. P-please. Well, excuse me. You have upset this poor woman so much that she can barely speak. You need to leave right now. Well, I... No. Now, go on. Thank you. Th... Th-Th-Th... [Clears throat] Th-Th-Th... thank... thank... Thank you. You're welcome. There are the guys. I'm gonna go get ready for that test launch. Scott. Sweetheart! Oh! Oh, my goodness! Scott, what are you doing?! [Laughing] Aah! Please stop! Stop! [Laughing] [Grunts] [Sighs] Everybody warned me about you. My family. Your family. The coxswain on the Navy rowing team. But I married you anyway. Because I love you. And I think you can be amazing. So don't humiliate me. Not in private, but especially not in public. I'm sorry. Good. [Door opens, closes] Announcer :  Excited crowds gather to watch the first unmanned mission before an astronaut heads into space. Man :  T-minus 30 and counting. Man : Mercury capsule, go. Man #2 : Range operations, go. 10, 9, 8... [Camera shutter clicking] [Engines roar] Ignition sequence start. Engines on... 5, 4, 3... 2, 1. All engines running. Launch commenced. Liftoff. We have liftoff. Would you look at that? Louise : The men must be thrilled. Next time, it'll be one of them up there. [All gasp] [Indistinct shouting] [Exhales sharply] At least the monkey wasn't in that one. No more photos. Today's off the record. Are they kidding? They're gonna put a man up there? I think my heart stopped beating. Wally is never going up in that thing. Do they know what they're doing? I'm sure they'll learn from their mistakes. It's why they do tests. It's fine. It's not fine. That could have been my Gus up there! I've got to get out of here before I say something I'm gonna regret. Trudy : A rocket explodes, "it's fine." Your husband's unfaithful. That's fine, too. Alan loves me. You don't have to put up with him running around. Being a modern wife means challenging your husband to be better. My husband  is  better. He's the best. We are partners, in our marriage and in this competition, so may the best man  and  woman win. [Sea gulls crying] Announcer :  NASA has announced our first spacemen. The field of seven has been narrowed to three. Now the nation is on pins and needles. Who will be the first to go up? [Indistinct conversations] This is great! Daddy! You're home! [Sighs] Louise : Alan. What are you doing here? I had some news that couldn't wait. Girls, your father is gonna be the first man in space. Yay! Yay! [Laughs] I want you to know I couldn't have done this without you. It's your win, too. I want you to come to the cape with me. [Laughs] Oh. Yeah? What's going on? I need a statement. A statement about what? It's the Russians. They got a man into space. We just heard. Yuri Gagarin. They're saying... They're saying he orbited. Maybe a statement can wait until the morning. I don't know what to say except that now the country needs this, needs  you,  more than ever. [Dog barking in distance] Trudy : It's bad enough the Russians got into space first. Now  Life's  putting Yuri on the cover? Whose side are they on? Edged out of the history books by three weeks. Even I feel bad for Alan. How's Louise? Down at the cape, but I haven't talked to her. With the flight coming up, I thought she'd call or send a card, but there's been nothing. She's not thinking of going through that launch alone. You know Louise. She doesn't need anyone. I called a cab. What? I'm gonna drive you. The airport's so far, and... you need to rest, clear your head. Look at me. I'm not worried. Then I'm not worried, either. Good. [The Bear's "Dark Star" plays] Wait, what? You're doing the countdown? Yep. Got my finger on the button. That's a huge responsibility. The whole launch depends on you. 10, 9, 8... How do I sound? That sounds good. I've really missed this, Trudy. Honestly, Gus, as much as I wanted it for you, I'm glad Alan's going up first. ♪ Let those dreams just float away ♪ 
♪ silent decay of light, remember ♪ 
♪ the day I first saw you look back at me ♪ 
♪ only stars in my heart beating constantly ♪ Come home safe. The 37-year-old Navy test pilot seems to be the calmest man of hundreds involved in the launching as he walks to the elevator that will carry him 65 feet to the capsule. [Indistinct conversations] Hundreds of missiles have been launched from Cape Canaveral. But for the first time, there is to be a man aboard, just three weeks after the Russians say they orbited Yuri Gagarin around the earth. While that flight took place in complete secrecy, all of America is eager to see our first man in flight. [Knock on door] Hi. It's us. Rene : Annie made ham loaf. And I made my bacon banana hollandaise. We've got enough food for an army. Just because NASA doesn't allow wives down at the cape doesn't mean you should be alone. Trudy : No one can really know what you're going through. But hopefully, we're the next best thing. I mean that. Well, as much as I appreciate the gesture, I'm fine. Louise? Do you know the difference between a redstone rocket and a nuclear missile? Nothing. Alan is sitting on the world's biggest firecracker and they're about to light the match, so I really wouldn't... turn up my nose at a little human kindness right now. If you want to be kind... You'll respect my privacy. Thank you. [Sighs] Party at my place? Are you sure you want to send them away? The last thing I need in my house is six giddy women and their deviled eggs. I'm assuming that's off the record. [Indistinct conversations] The gantry is moving away from the rocket as we anticipate the countdown at any moment now. You don't smoke. Today I do. And here we go. Boy : The countdown is starting! 10, 9, 8, 7... All : 10, 9, 8, 7... ...6, 5, 4, 3... [ Explosion ] ...2, 1. We have liftoff. The clock has started. [Excited gasping] All : Go! Go! Go! Go!

What are they gonna do? It's the g's. Is it supposed to take so long? Does the station know anything? Freedom 7,  this is capcom. Do you read? [Static] Alan : Copy that, capcom. This is  freedom 7. Yes! We got him. Just relaying my condition is still good. I'm getting ready for impact. We got him. Mission control is in communication with astronaut Shepard, and he is okay. We are hearing that everything is a-okay. [Cheering] You promised the press a comment. Louise? Mm. Ohh. [Clears throat] Louise? Alan can never know I was scared. No one can. They won't. Hey, let... let me handle the reporters. No, I can do it. [Camera shutters clicking] [Indistinct conversations] Man : There she is. Max : All right, everyone stop pushing. Stop pushing. Everyone take three steps backwards. Mrs. Shepard's not saying anything till she gets some breathing room. Here, move. Move, there. All right. [Camera shutters clicking] Man : Ma'am, could we get a statement, please? I am very grateful for the efforts of the entire Mercury program. Today is a victory, not just for my husband but for America and the free world. Thank you. [Applause] President Kennedy :  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express, uh, the great pleasure we have in welcoming commander Shepard and Mrs. Shepard here today. I want to, uh, again express my congratulations, uh, to Alan Shepard. Trudy : Well, she looks good. Uh, we're, uh, very proud of him. Hmm. You'll get there. We all will. As the first United States astronaut... Announcer :  There they are... The first lady and the first lady of space. First lady? Well, isn't that something? [Chuckles] I can't believe this room. I can't believe this day. [Chuckles] [Sighs] I'm tired. This was wonderful, but exhausting. Yeah. Big day. I mean, all of it... Mercury, the mission. You did it. You were amazing. Now we can take a step back, just breathe. Louise, tonight the president asked me if I thought we could put a man on the moon. I told him we can. We are going to the moon, so there is no breathing. Right. Well... ...we'll get through this together. That's why we have each other. Yeah. There's a transpo plane leaving tonight. I'm gonna catch it. I want to wake up at the cape and get right to it. I'll call you tomorrow, usual time. [Smooches] [Meaghan Smith's "The Moon Makes a Fool of Me" plays] [Sighs] ♪ You're saying things you shouldn't say ♪ 
♪ meaning things you don't mean ♪ I bet they wouldn't launch a rocket if it wasn't safe. Well, it's as safe as we can make it, but we're doing something that's never been done before. So there's a chance you could die? Yeah, a pretty good one. That sounds scary. It's more lonely than scary, not that Gordo here would know. Hi, I'm Alan. Shepard. I know. Wow-oh-wow. The first man in space. First  American  man. Russians got there first. Also Ham the chimp... [Chuckles] - ...Some rodents, canines, a couple dozen fruit flies. And yet, still, not you.

What you said about human kindness... Does your offer still stand? What about your privacy? [Inhales deeply] I can't change who I am, Trudy, but we're going to the moon. The moon. [Chuckles] We wives are gonna need each other. [Up-tempo music plays in distance] [Insects chirping] [Telephone ringing] Hello? Rene : Look out your window. Is Trudy Cooper having some kind of a party? If she is, she didn't invite me. [Music continues] Should we pop by? Knock, knock. [Chuckles] We couldn't sleep. We thought we heard music. Oh, you did. Come on in, Betty. The girls are in bed, but you boys can go on inside. Hi. [Telephone ringing] Oh, looks like Annie's got some moves. I think if we had a contest, she would win. I'll put a dollar on Annie. Trudy : Betty? It's for you. Gus. Looks like someone traded in the station wagon. Less room for groceries, but it goes from 0 to 60 in eight seconds. Why is dad calling so late? I don't know, sweetie. Is something wrong? Hey, hon. Are you okay? Gus is going up next. I'm gonna be the second lady of space! Betty. [Chuckles] You have to tell me everything. Well, you don't have to. I read the article. It just seemed like the best day of your life. It was, yes. [Clears throat] The best.

[Laughter] [Volume increases] The queen has spoken. That's good. [Laughter] Man : Mrs. Shepard, what does it feel like to be headed out on such a historic adventure? Well, we don't know what our path will be or what toll this journey will take on each of us, but we have to trust it will be successful. And if we ever feel lost, all we need to do is look around and see that we're not traveling alone.
