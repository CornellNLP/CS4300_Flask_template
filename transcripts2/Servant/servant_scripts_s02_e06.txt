 Do you know who you welcomed into your home? 
 [GEORGE] 
 Leanne has done something impetuous. 
 Mrs. 
 Marino treats me very well here. The family I was stationed with,   the mother's very sick. They need me. - [SEAN] What did you do? - [GROANS, GRUNTS] "Bring    ,    to the Franklinville Mall food court,   p.m. tomorrow". - This just doesn't feel right. - [SIGHS] They're not in it for the money. Why would you do that to her? Because I wanna see her get what she deserves. [DOROTHY SCREAMS] Julian? -    - [MUSIC BOX PLAYING "BRAHMS'S LULLABY"] - [BABY COOS] [LULLABY CONTINUES] [JERICHO COOING] - [DOOR SLAMS] - [SEAN] Babe? It's here! It came! Dorothy? [MOUTHING WORDS] Shut up. [WHISPERS] Sorry, but come and see it. I read that colic isn't necessarily caused by indigestion. It can be the result of psychic pain. He doesn't have psychic pain, honey. He's a baby. Well... Well, leaving the womb can be very traumatic. Well, this will solve everything. Because if we drink enough of it, who needs sleep? Does it make magic caffeine? Kind of. Wait till you taste the crema. Portafilter. Fifty-eight millimeter, chrome-plated brass. Mm. [JERICHO FUSSES] - [LOUD CRYING] - [DOROTHY SIGHS] [WHISPERS] No. [CRYING CONTINUES] - I'll go. - I'll make you a macchiato. [SEAN CHUCKLES] [DOOR LOCK CLICKS] [DOROTHY SIGHS] [GROANS] - [GEORGE] Where is she? - [DOOR SLAMS] [SHOUTS] Where is she? [DOROTHY STAMMERS] Julian, stop him. - That's far enough. - [DOROTHY] You listen. Now, I explained this to you in the car. If you wanna see Leanne, you will bring us Jericho. "Thou shalt not do violence    unto a hired servant that is poor and needy". Deuteronomy. "Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here every day". Guns N' Roses. - Leanne! - Don't you dare yell in my house. How could she have returned here? She assured us she understood. All right. All right. Let's take a breath    and talk about this like civilized humans. George. Indulge me, okay? Let's try to work this out. Can we make a deal? [CHAIR SCRAPES] - [SEAN] Let's talk about this. - [KEYS JINGLE] Everything I delegate turns to sh1t. Sean, just be firm and watch the money. We had a deal that the baby stays with us. Your deal was not with me. - Where the f*ck did you find him? - He was at the mall. Leanne sent the ransom. She was f*cking with you. [THUNDER RUMBLES] - [LOCK CLICKS] - [DOOR OPENS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE] [DOROTHY SIGHS] Looks like someone had quite a midnight snack. How was your evening, Mrs. Turner? A success. We found your uncle. He's downstairs as we speak. You're not a very good liar. Surprising with all the practice you get. You can try and bait me, Leanne, but it won't work. Jericho is coming home, and when he does,    you'll be on your way with your uncle back to where you belong. And until then, you'll stay locked in here. - [DOOR CLOSES] - [LOCK CLICKS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] Festering. Something rotten. [SEAN] The pipes. We're getting the pipework done. The house. Of course. [JULIAN] Oh. [SEAN] George. [SIGHS] - She caused this. - [SEAN] It's a plumbing issue. It's an old water pipe. Should've been replaced decades ago. Foundation crumbling. [SNIFFS] Is this his despair at her lack of submission? In my opinion, no. - [DOROTHY] There you are. - How long?  - What? - [GEORGE] How long has she been here?  - [SHOUTS] How long... - [SEAN] A week! She's been here a week.  And you kept her all this time?  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  - No, no, no! - Jesus!  This cannot happen. [GASPS]  - [DOROTHY] What is he talking about? - [JULIAN] He's out of his f*cking mind.  - "For they know not what they have done... - Is he praying for us?  - No, he's doing that... - Hey! Don't you pray for me!  ... for you are good and forgiving and abounding in steadfast love     - for all who call upon you". - I have nothing to be forgiven for.  - [MURMURS] - [RAINING]  It may not be too late to fix it.  [GEORGE GRUNTING]  [DOROTHY] Stop him.  Sean!  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]  [SEAN] I don't know what you want me to do.  - [DOROTHY] Go up there. - Where is she?  Where is she? [GRUNTS]  [GEORGE PANTS]  [DOROTHY] I'll cut him into pieces     until he tells me where Jericho is.  [SEAN] What good will that do?  What do you suggest?  We need to learn to talk his language.  He's batshit.  So let me talk to him, one-on-one.  You?  You tried in the car. It antagonized him.  [DOROTHY SIGHS]  So I'll play along.  Make him think I believe in his crazy rantings.  That way, maybe he'll trust me.  Okay. I've been in three fistfights in my life,     and every single one of them was because of Dorothy.  - Bring on number four. - I cannot fight you, Julian.  But you can be punched.  Why are you not frightened?  - Of you? - Of her.  Of what she has done.  The baby. He should never have been here.  It was a mistake!  Julian, I've got this.  - Sean, I don't think you do. - [THUNDER RUMBLES]  Dorothy needs you.  And? Did he drop any hints about where Jericho is?  Guy's a f*cking loon.  Wouldn't shut up about returning Leanne.  What is so important about this house where we found her?  [SIGHS] I tried to punch him, but he wouldn't let me.  [LIQUID POURING]  Where is Leanne?  She's safe.  [CEILING CREAKS]  What have you done, Sean?  We needed help, and she was the only one we could turn to.  - So you took her? - We didn't know what else to do.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  [GEORGE, MUFFLED] This is all her fault.  She made you hope for something that is not possible.  It was cruel. Irresponsible.  We must return her.  [SEAN] To that house?  Why does she have to go back there? Please, explain it to me.  I know she's special... and you.  But I don't understand. So, please, tell me.  Leanne's always wearing that little plastic necklace     that boy made her.  Maybe we could try to get more out of her.  You buried her alive, Dottie.  She might not be a reliable source.  Well, he mustn't get to her.  They'll scheme. They'll join forces.  Your nephew's life is in the balance.  I'm gonna go guard her door.  Just need to top off first.  Leanne... has a rebellious streak.  Present from childhood.  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]  It's worrisome.  She often strays from our...  communal edicts.  And...  you mean communal as in what community?  You know who we are.  - No, I don't. - You do.  You just pretend not to.  George, I have no f*cking idea who you are.  [CLICKS TONGUE]  We are all amongst you.  Though we try not to take up space.  You might see us on street corners, under overpasses.  We are the ones who have been given     a second chance at life.  And we use it to enact God's divine plan.  To help others.  But... Wait. So you're saying you're a f*cking...  But we can only help the people we are told to help,     and Leanne disobeys.  She has a bad habit of being headstrong,     of exercising free will.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  Jericho.  That was his name?  Jericho.  Bringing him here,     coming here in the first place...  That was not her call to make.  She was not following his rules.  That's why the baby couldn't stay.  And...  then she meddled further. Look at the signs.  But what can I do? How do I fix it?  I miss him.  Your only hope is to take her back to where she is needed.  Where she was placed.  And pray for forgiveness.  Forgiveness for what?  You know that too.  [CELL PHONE RING ECHOING]  [SPEAKERS: MAN SINGING OPERA]  - Hello. - [WOMAN] Is this Sean Turner?  - Yes. - Hi, I'm Taylor,   calling from Gourmet Gauntlet. Are you familiar with the show?  Yeah, I've caught a few episodes.  I'm a big fan. "Your journey's over".   Exactly. How would you like to be a part of season two?  - Wow. Really? - Yes, as our head judge.  - Me? Stop. The head judge? - Mm-hmm  Yeah, that would be incredible.   That's awesome. We shoot in LA in a few weeks' time.   I'll have the lawyers work up the paperwork.  Yeah, thing is, I can't leave home right now.  If it was shooting in Philly, I... I could make that work, but, uh...   - Oh. - Yeah, we have a two-month-old.   - Yeah, hands full. - Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Exactly.  [DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLES]  [THUNDER CONTINUES]  [GEORGE] If you return her, Sean...  make things right...  I'll undo what she did.  I'll heal you.  That's how you'll be reunited with him.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  [GASPS]  [DOROTHY] Where are you going? Where's he going?  He's making me a salve.  Okay. And? Anything?  Not really. All he wants is Leanne.  [JULIAN] And yet he's going off to play doctor.  Don't ask me to explain him.  [DOROTHY] What we need to do is get in touch with May Markham.  She is obviously the one who makes the decisions here.  [SEAN] Well, how do we do that?  [DOROTHY] I don't know. Get his phone?  [SEAN] I doubt he has one.  He doesn't seem to have anything     apart from that suit he got married in and my Italian shoes.  Well, what else did he say to you in there?  Nothing really. He just...  Well, he kept insisting that     Leanne should be back at that Marino...  Oh, my God. If I have to hear about this     f*cking disabled woman one more time.  He mentioned divine repercussions.  What? That's priceless.  What? Boils? Locusts? A flood?  - Well, I know, but... [SIGHS] - [DOROTHY] But what?  Well, the cellar, the day after we brought her here.  I don't like the words     that are coming out of your mouth right now, Sean.  If you think he gets Leanne     before I have my baby back in my arms... 
 
  No, I know.  If you believe what he says, you're as crazy as they are.  I don't believe him.  [DOROTHY SIGHS] You made some great strides, Sean,     but I will take it from here.  [SPITS]  I'm stating the f*cking obvious,     but your house isn't equipped     for the number of prisoners it currently accommodates.  He's not a f*cking prisoner.  He'd have to get past Dorothy first, so he is our prisoner.  [INHALES DEEPLY]  Much like Rapunzel in there. [EXHALES]  I need to talk to her.  She's not the sweet child you think she is, Sean.  Oh, no? So what is she then?  I'm serious, Julian. What the f*ck is she?  [DOOR OPENS]  [LEANNE SIGHS]  What was he saying about me?  My uncle.  Uh, nothing.  I heard you.  It's not nice to talk about people behind their backs.  He said we have to return you to where we found you.  He said you're needed there, so...  And you believe him?  I don't know what I believe.  [GRUNTS SOFTLY]  [INHALES DEEPLY]  [MURMURS]  [GRUNTS SOFTLY]  Did you disobey your aunt and uncle when you first came to us?  [WIND WHISTLING]  So you came because you wanted to help?  Please, we need your help right now.  [SIGHS] I already told you.  I don't think that Jericho can come home, Sean.  Ah, but maybe he can. I think we can fix it.  [WHISPERING, INDISTINCT]  Never interrupt a man in prayer.  Do you know what $   ,   can buy you these days?  I mean, not you, because you have no need for anything,     but in the actual world...  this money could help a lot of disadvantaged people.  Feed them. Build huts. Whatever.  Choose any charity. Give to the poor.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  You are impossible!  "He who trusts in his riches shall fall,     but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf".  How do you call yourself righteous?  You kidnapped my son.  [GEORGE GASPS]  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  She was down here?  [WHISPERS] No.  [STAMMERS]  I don't know. Maybe.  It's progressing.  Her presence here is an infection.  [INHALES SHARPLY]  It's spreading.  - What hath she wrought? [GASPS] - No, I...  I don't think that's what that is.  Then how do you explain it?  - [DOOR CLOSES] - [GRUNTS] What did she tell you?  [KEY JINGLES]  We have to take her back to the house tonight.  That's where they're holding  il bambino ?  Can't keep them both here. You said it yourself.  He's more useful than she is.  So we keep the uncle, let Leanne walk.  At least we'll know where she is.  Dorothy's not gonna buy this plan.  That's why we're not gonna tell her.  I'm just gonna do it, and you're gonna help me.  [SIGHS] The f*ck I am.  You're gonna distract her. You'll be the decoy.  [WHISPERS] Pray with me.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  - No. - [GASPS]  Pray with me to set her back on the right path.  Pray for her?  Not on your f*cking life.  You must surrender, Dorothy.  Surrender to what?  To a god who would let your precious flower run off with my child?  - Hey! Get your hands off of her! - [GEORGE] Thou...  - Oh, Juju, be careful. - What'd you say to him?  Nothing.  What the f*ck is this?  f*ck! Oh, there's mud all over it!  You weep for your filthy cash.  Weep for what you have done.  [WHIRRING]   Tonight, a peanut butter in your local grocery store   that just might be giving you cancer.  - [FEMALE NEWSCASTER] Peanut butter? - I know.   - Can't even enjoy a good old-fashioned... - [KEYPAD BEEPS]  - Okay, come on. - Wait. Wait.  [NEWSCAST CONTINUES]  I'll go with you.  But you need to promise to take me somewhere else.  I need you to drive me where they can't find me.  Anywhere, but far away.  Okay? Promise me.  - But your uncle, he said... - Whatever he said...  he won't bring Jericho back.  [WHISPERS] Please. Please, far away.  I promise.  You're lying.  [DOROTHY] Sean! [ECHOES]  - [JERICHO CRYING] - [LIQUID GURGLING]  [DOROTHY] Sean!  - [CELL PHONE RINGING] - [CRYING CONTINUES]  [STEAM HISSING]  Hello?   Sean, it's Taylor from  Gourmet Gauntlet,  returning your call.  [LOUD CRYING]  Can you hold him so I can get my shoes?   - Have I caught you at a bad time? - Uh, hold... One second, Taylor.  [JERICHO STOPS CRYING, COOS]  [DOOR OPENS]  - Hi, Taylor? You still there? - Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah, I'm glad you called. Thanks for getting back to me.  Turns out things have shifted on my end,     so I'll be able to make LA work.   But I thought you couldn't leave Philly.  No, no, no. Yeah, LA will be fine.   Oh, that's great news.  - [JERICHO COOING] - [THUNDER RUMBLES IN DISTANCE]  [FEMALE NEWSCASTER] ... a woman who saved a cat   by jumping into a swimming pool.  [WALKER] Well, on a more serious note, our big story of the night,   we go to Isabelle live in West Chester for more.  - I promise. - [SIRENS WAILING ON TV]   This is Isabelle Carrick coming to you live   from outside the Marino estate in West Chester   where tragedy has struck the community.   We don't know much, but there were reports of gunfire.  If she does not [SNORTS] leave this house...  I don't care!  I don't care what happens.  Nothing matters if I don't have my son!  You must own the part you played, Dorothy.  I didn't do anything to her she didn't deserve.  And if Sean hadn't come down here, I would've left her in there!  What have you done?  Don't you realize     you will never be reunited with Jericho now?  "For whosoever keeps the law     and yet stumbles at just one point...  If you quote scripture at me     - one more f*cking time! - ... is guilty of breaking all of it!"     [THUNDER RUMBLES]  [THUNDER BOOMS]  [DOROTHY WHIMPERS]  [DOROTHY PANTS]  Sean. Sean, what are you doing?  [ISABELLE] There seems to be a lot of police out there   as multiple city departments try to figure out what happened.   News crews are being kept at bay and, as you can see.   police cars and ambulances are still arriving on the scene.  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER]   We're told neighbors reported   a round of gunshots at  :   in the morning,   just half an hour ago.   The body count is still uncertain.   Authorities have yet to release information on the whereabouts   or safety of the family inside.   More on this case as it develops. I'm Isabelle Carrick,   News.  Look what you have done.
