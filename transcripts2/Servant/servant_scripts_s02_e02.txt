 [DOROTHY] 
 Can you hear me? They've taken Jericho. 
 But she's grieving the wrong child. 
 He's not dead. 
 [SEAN] 
 We have to find them 
 before Dorothy involves the whole neighborhood and beyond. 
 And she's not gonna stop looking. 
 Not while they have Jericho. 
 This is Roscoe, the guy I was telling you about. 
 You're a private detective? 
 Hey, lady, are you okay? 
 [WIND HOWLING] 
 [GASPS] 
 What is this? 
 [DOROTHY] 
 They've been watching us. 
 - [WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY] 
 - [CHILD SHOUTS IN DISTANCE] 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 [SIGHING] 
 [WATER RUNNING] 
 [PIPES RUMBLE] 
 - [SQUEAKS] 
 - [BABY CRIES] 
 [BABY CRIES] 
 - [SHUSHES] 
 Please. 
 - [JERICHO CRYING] 
 Oh, don't cry so much for mama, please. 
 [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 Did you just draw a bath? 
 His face scrunches up when he cries. 
 Look. 
 [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 I know you've asked for some privacy, but couldn't the cleaners at least come in? 
 - Okay. 
 - [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 [DOROTHY] 
 What if he's hungry? 
 ... for mama, please. 
 - What if they're not feeding him? 
 - [SIGHS] 
 Of course they're feeding him. 
 Hey, people don't steal babies to mistreat them. 
 [DOROTHY ON TV CHUCKLES, SHUSHES] 
 Here, why don't you try? Come on, put the phone down. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 
 - Shh. 
 Shh. 
 Shh. - [JERICHO GIGGLES] [DOROTHY] Aw. Shh. Okay. - Yeah? - [JERICHO MURMURS, GIGGLES] Yeah. - Hi. - [DOROTHY CHUCKLES] - [LEANNE] Hello. - She doesn't love him. [CHUCKLES] - [DOROTHY] Hi. - [CHUCKLES] [DOORBELL RINGS] [SIGHS] They sent something! - [KNIFE CUTTING] - [BOX OPENS] [PAPER RUSTLES] [GASPS] What does it mean? Actually, that was from me. I ordered it a few weeks ago for the baptism. - Cute, huh? - [SIGHS] [SIGHS] People don't give space suit costumes for a baptism. And what do they give? A silver pendant with a little dying man on it? Yeah, I'm the f*cking weird one. My stomach is tight. It always happens when Jericho cries. Why is he crying, Julian? Your stomach feels tight because you haven't eaten in four days. [GROANS] [JULIAN SIGHS] I can feel him. You're just projecting your fears, okay? [STAMMERS] He might be crying. He might be laughing. Or he might be sh1tting in his diaper. There's no way for you to know. You don't believe in anything. You never did. You know what you are, Julian? You're an atheist. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Who wants to go to space? Yes, you f*cking do. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] - [PEOPLE CHATTERING] - [CAR HOOTING] [GROANS SOFTLY] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [SLURPS, GROANS] [SNIFFS] [SIZZLING] What are you making? [SEAN] Caramel French toast. It's her favorite. Yeah, when she was eight. Will you take it up to her when it's ready? Why can't you? I don't know what to say anymore. I feel like I'm just making things worse. This may be an embarrassing question. What's your current cash flow? For what? I'm thinking a ransom demand might help reassure her. Give her a little hope. What should we ask for? For a fake ransom we're never gonna collect, we're never gonna pay? Hmm, have at it. Twenty million. [SIGHS] We need to give Dorothy something realistic to reach for. Have her value the jewelry. As long as it keeps her occupied. What do you say, like,    ,    ? Don't be shy. I think you should put this much effort into finding them before she does. - You're burning. - What? Ah, you... - [SOBBING, PANTING] - Free yourself, brother. - [PANTING, GRUNTS]  - The flesh. - [GRUNTING]  - Yes. Release. - [WHIPPING CONTINUES] - [GRUNTING CONTINUES] [DOROTHY GROANS] [WHIMPERING] [GRUNTING] - [MAY] This pain is good. - [GRUNTING] [CELL PHONE RINGS] - [MAY] ... courageous. - [MAN WHIMPERING] [WHIPPING CONTINUES] Who's this? [KNOCKS] [KNOCKS] Sorry. Did I leave my keys in here? Where have you been? I was out front all night. Julian told me to keep watch. [PANTING] You cleaned up already? The party. Any food left over? I'm starving. What? [SIGHS] Zip me up, will you? [CLEARS THROAT] Sorry. Are we going somewhere? Yes. The studio called. They need me to go in. You think that's a good idea? Melanie's off sick, and they need someone to coanchor the six o'clock. Maybe we should talk to Sean about this? I don't need Sean's permission to do anything. But Jericho. Exactly. Jericho. That's why I'm doing this. [WHISPERS] Go in there. [FOOTSTEPS] Can you talk some sense into her? - Not usually. - She thinks she's going in to work. It's been four days, and I can't just lie here. I need to reassure Jericho that everything is gonna be okay. [SEAN] On TV? I'm not gonna say anything I shouldn't. But if they're watching the news, maybe Jericho can have a little mommy time. That's insane. I'm coanchoring, so record from the beginning. Okay, will do. You out of your f*cking mind? Why'd you let her leave? We need her out of the house. Mm. Mm. Where the f*ck has he been? [WHISPERS] Why you asking me? Hey, where were you? In the car, where you told me to be. I'm gonna have to bill you for a full    hours. This is so good. I can't believe how hungry I am. Do you have maple syrup? I... I checked your car every day. It never moved, and you were not in it. Roscoe, what day is it? Monday. Roscoe, it's Friday. No, it's not. [SNIFFS] It's Friday? Oh. [GROANS] [GULPS] My wife and daughter, they must be so worried. - I need to call them... - Yeah, in a minute. Cassie's flute recital. I missed it? [SEAN] What's the last thing you remember, Roscoe? What... What? Oh, uh... I don't know. I was in the car. It was right after the party. This lady, she was standing in the street. I thought she wanted help, but... I don't know what happened after that. [GROANS] I feel nauseous. Get some water. Do you believe him? - I don't really know him that well. - You hired him. Oh. And how many part-time private investigators did you recommend? [SIGHS] He's got    photos of the inside of his pocket. There's a   -second video. It may have caught audio. [SOFT CLINKING ON VIDEO] [ZIPPER OPENS] [ROSCOE] Please. - [DOOR CREAKS, CLOSES] - [ROSCOE] Please make it stop. [LEANNE] There's no need to be afraid, Roscoe. It's Leanne. Is that Leanne? [ROSCOE SOBBING] [LEANNE] We're here to help you. [ROSCOE] Stop. [SOBS] [LEANNE] Nothing bad is going to happen to you. [SOBBING CONTINUES] Why is he crying like that? What are they doing to him? They're breaking him. - It's what cults do. - [ROSCOE] I don't want to be here. [ROSCOE WHINES ON VIDEO] Was that me? You were there with Leanne. Don't bullshit us. Did she have the baby with her? I didn't see anyone. I just woke up. Don't make me take your teeth out, Roscoe. - I'd like to see you try. - Wait. Just relax. If you're gonna play games with us, just f*ck the f*ck off. - Wait. Just wait. - We're not gonna get any sense out of him. - He's been brainwashed or drugged. - Yeah, but he was there. I can hear you, you know. Maybe you saw something that could help us. We just need to unlock it. - You wanna know what happened, right? - Yeah. What the... What are you suggesting? We get him drunk? Force a grenache down his neck, see if he talks? [WHISPERS] We call Natalie. Oh, no. - No. - Yeah. - Come on. - Over my dead body. - Hi, honey. - Hello. [KISSES] - Where is she? - Uh, Dorothy? She's at work. Is that a good idea? Probably not. I'll let Sean explain. Sean? We need you to hypnotize someone for us. He may have seen something useful, but he's blocking it out. Oh. Well, don't you have something to say? What's this? Every time I have a hypnosis appointment in the calendar, - Julian mocks me. - Not you. The people who you service. Because he doesn't believe in hypnosis. Uh, you're misquoting me, okay? I believe the people who allow themselves to be hypnotized are weak and suggestible and therefore occupy a lower shelf on the social strata. - Oh, but now it's okay? - [SIGHS] Pretty f*cking please, with a cherry on top, will you hypnotize our friend? [SIGHS] I want you to raise your hands for me, palms up. Very good. Resist. Resist. Resist. Okay. That's good. I want you to know this is a safe space. I will be recording this session in its entirety, and I will endeavor to make you comfortable at all times. Can we scroll through the f*cking disclaimer? Just put him under already. There's no hypnosis without consent. I wanna know what happened in the last four days. Great. Hands, please. [ROSCOE INHALES] As I push down this time, resist my pressure as you count down slowly from    . Ninety-nine. Ninety-eight. Ninety-seven. Ninety-six. Ninety-five. Ninety-four. [WATER TRICKLING] Ninety-three. [MUTTERS] [NATALIE] He's under. What do you want to ask him? [SEAN] Where were you, Roscoe? [TRICKLING CONTINUES] [ROSCOE] They've taken me to a... room. They won't turn on the lights. My hand... They've tied my hands with something. It's straw. Where did you go? We never left. You mean Philly? The smell. Oh. Something's off. Rotten. What can you see? What can you hear? [MUMBLING] [MUMBLING] [GARBLED SPEECH] [GARBLED WORD] He's behind the door. 
 
 Who? Take a deep breath. You're in a safe space here. No, he's f*cking not. Go back there. Who's behind the door? Knees! Knees! Knees! Knees! [GRUNTS] They're on their knees for him. They're bleeding. Can... Can you see Leanne? - [MUMBLING] And... And... - I think we should slow this down. His hand is a hook. [SEAN] Do you see a baby? Is there a baby? Does he have the baby? [GARBLED] Crying. Crying. The baby's crying. - Baby's crying. - [SEAN] Is he okay? Pss... Pss... Pss... Four. Pss... Pss... Four. Pss... Baby. - Passing baby forward. - We... We... We need to stop. Where... Where he waits. [INHALES DEEPLY] He's holding him. What is he doing with him? Eyes. Eyes. Eyes. Eyes. He takes out the eyes, and he throws them away. [HAND CLAPS] [JULIAN SIGHS] [VIDEO RECORDER WHIRS] [FANFARE PLAYS] Good evening. This is   News, and I'm Walker Roush. Coming up tonight, Christmas toys that can kill. A shocking story that every parent will want to watch. Tonight, Melanie is off, but joining us on the desk and filling in is our very capable Dorothy Turner. Dorothy. [INHALES DEEPLY] Hello. [GENTLE TONE OF VOICE] This is the news before bedtime. Let's begin with the gridlock you'll face on your drive home tonight. Leslie, how's it looking out there? [NATALIE] You've had quite the scare. I think you should take some time to process what you saw. Why couldn't I remember that? The mind is powerful. It does a very good job of protecting us. How are you feeling? Well, that was quite a performance. Oh, come on. - Were we watching the same thing? - [SIGHS] He was being drugged, okay? He could've been seeing anything. No one would do that to a baby, would they? Natalie, can you talk some sense into this moron? It was an hallucination. No. I recognized everything he described. I've worked with many people who have survived near-death experiences. Oh, my God. There's no such thing as a near-death experience, okay? There's a death experience and there's an alive experience, and there's f*ck all in between. The woman, who has not yet been identified, was discovered on the side of the expressway on Wednesday morning. Forensics said her body went unnoticed for at least two weeks. What are you doing, babe? [SIGHS] What does it look like I'm doing? I'm making a ransom demand out of macaroni. [SIGHS] Why are you looking so hard for this baby? I mean, with Sean I get it. But with you... For Dorothy. Is everything for darling Dorothy? Hmm? Or do you miss him too? Jericho's dead. Not him. The other one. I always wanted to go into space. Okay. I mean, deep, deep f*cking space. You know, past the icy planets. Out of the Milky Way and beyond, you know? I wanted to reach the end and just bang on the f*cking wall. Turns out there might not be a wall. So... I decided not to go. Sweetheart, look at me. I really wanna help you. I have tried everything. Cognitive, mindfulness, psychodynamic. - I mean, I've dropped acid with you. - Nothing helps. Because you don't let it. Sweetie, you have to believe in something. No matter how stupid it sounds. Hey, uh, thank you for... for doing that. For... For going back there. [KEYS JINGLE] [SNIFFS] [CHUCKLES] I never use that pocket. I... I need to go home. Spend some time with the family. What you gonna tell 'em? Daddy was on a job that went long. Had some patchy cell service. Had some bad dreams. I hope you find him. I hope he's okay. [HORN HONKS IN DISTANCE] [WALKER] And that'll just about wrap things up for us here tonight. Dorothy, have you enjoyed your time on the desk? [DOROTHY] Absolutely, Walker. It has been an honor to get to talk to the viewers at home... of all ages. Well, we have just enough time left to check in with Melanie and see how her recovery is going. - Melanie, you're... - Actually, Walker, I'm sure Melanie wouldn't mind if we use these final   seconds for a charitable plea. We all know the plight of missing teenagers, a cause that is close to my own heart. Leanne Grayson has been missing for five days. If anyone has seen Leanne or has any information on her whereabouts, please contact me here at the station. And, Leanne, if you're watching, please come home. We all miss you. And if you at home are wondering, uh, Melanie does assure us she will be back at... at work tomorrow. So, we'll talk to you then. [CLEARS THROAT] Good night. Night night. [PAN SCRAPING] [SEAN] I didn't hear you come in. I called. Here. Hey, hey, hey. Let me get it. All you gotta do... is add water to burnt caramel and bring it to a boil. [BURNER CLICKS, IGNITES] [SIGHS] Well, I don't think they'll be inviting me back to the desk anytime soon. [CHUCKLES] You did what any good mother would do. Mm. My stomach has settled. I can breathe again. I think he's sleeping. Yeah. I think so too. Mm. [CARAMEL CRACKLING] [WATER RUNNING] [TABLET RINGS] Yeah? [LEANNE] Why is she looking for me? Leanne? [PIPE CREAKS] [PIPES GROANING, CREAKING] [RUMBLING] Sean! Where are you, Leanne? Why haven't you told her what she did? [CRICKETS CHIRPING]
