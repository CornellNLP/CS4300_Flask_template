 -   My name is Leanne Grayson. 
 [WIND WHISTLING] 
 Leanne Grayson. 
 Leanne Grayson. 
 And I come from Wisconsin. 
 My name is Leanne Grayson, and I come from Wisconsin. 
 My special skill is baking cakes. 
 [OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 [MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 [DOOR HINGES CREAK] 
 [MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 [WHISKING] 
 - Oh! 
 You're up. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 - [MUSIC STOPS] 
 Uh... 
 Sean and I thought it might be a nice change for you to get out and about now and then. 
 A few scheduled units every day. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Do let us know your preferred hours. 
 Anyway, now we can get started. 
 Now, I didn't know your thoughts on blueberries. 
 I assure you these are sweet, not tart, but some people balk at any fruit in a pancake. 
 So, in that case, we do have chocolate chips. 
 Or berries and cream on the side, if that's what you prefer. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - [BURNER IGNITES] 
 I'm not sure if it's supposed to be medium or medium-high. 
 Sean! 
 Sean! 
 [SIGHS] 
 Okay. 
 I am so sorry we forgot about you all weekend. 
 You must be starving. 
 I am gonna make it up to you. 
 Is someone else joining us? 
 [KNOCKS] 
 [LOCK RATTLES] 
 [INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 I thought you could use a friend. 
 Oh. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Hey. 
 [ESPRESSO MACHINE HISSING] 
 [PILLS RATTLE] 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh. 
 - Oh. 
 Yes, please. 
 - Tobe. 
 Whoops. 
 And Leanne. 
 None for me. 
 - These are real delicious, Mrs. Turner. 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
 You should really try some. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Oh. 
 Morning, Chef. 
 Oh. 
 Uh... 
 Tobe's always expressed such a great interest in Leanne that I figured why not invite him over? 
 Well, don't look at me that way. 
 [WHISPERS] 
 You scared me. 
 What you did. 
 I know. 
 Harming her. 
 I know I went way too far. 
 But the fact remains, we still need to draw her out. 
 It's our only hope of bringing Jericho home. 
 I thought you'd be proud of me    for at least devising a new strategy. 
 So, um, how's everything? 
 Good. 
 I just wanted to say I'm, um, sorry about that night with the pizza. 
 I didn't know anything, or... 
 Mrs. Turner has explained the situation very clearly to me. 
 It's an important step in the healing process. 
 Acknowledgment. 
 [TOBE] 
 Right. 
 Well, [STAMMERS] it sounds like you fell in with a bad crew. 
 Mm. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Same thing happened to me in high school for a little bit, you know. 
 They weren't religious or anything, but they were just really into blow. 
 Not that I've ever done... 
 I mean, I've... 
 I've tried it once, but tha... 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Mm. 
 Jericho must be so happy to have you back. 
 I mean, I haven't seen that little guy around lately. 
 Jericho's with his grandpa today. 
 It's healthy to bond across generations. 
 [TOBE] 
 That's true. 
 So, I was thinking, Leanne, when everything's, you know, okay and good, um, maybe you and I can go and celebrate, if you want? 
 Just us? 
 Yes, it's important to have something to look forward to. 
 And when all of this horrible business is behind us, Leanne will be free to go wherever she pleases. 
 Right. 
 Now, wasn't that fun? 
 And more fun could be had if you cooperate. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You can see I'm doing what I'm supposed to, Leanne... 
 in regards to the ransom. 
 "Tell no one, baby lives". 
 Wait. 
 Uh... 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] 
 Here. 
 This is for your cuts. 
 - No, thank you. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 Leanne, I'm not the kind of person... 
 I'm sorry I hurt you. 
 But you have to understand, for Jericho, there is nothing I wouldn't do. 
 Nothing. 
 He's part of me, do you understand? 
 You can lock me in now. 
 [CHATTERING, LAUGHING IN DISTANCE] 
 One cup, dried apricots. 
 One cup, chopped dates. 
 One cup of butter. 
 [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 [MAN] 
 Ms. Turner? 
 Sign here. 
 Thank you. 
 [CHATTERING OUTSIDE] 
 Sean! 
 [TOILET FLUSHES] 
 Look! 
 It's f*cking tiny. 
 [SIGHS] 
 What does it mean? 
 Does it have genitals? 
 And you ordered it? 
 - I did not. 
 - [BANGING] 
 We should let her out. 
 We promised her the morning. 
 They've hacked our account. 
 They're using our credit cards. 
 - A message. 
 - [BANGING] 
 Oh! 
 [GASPS] 
 What does it say? 
 Oh, God. 
 [GASPS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Ingenious. 
 But in the future,     could we talk this sh1t through first? 
 - The f*ck is that? 
 - You didn't send it? 
 "Bring    ,    to the Franklinville Mall food court,      :   p.m. tomorrow. 
 Cash only". 
 I know we need to keep her occupied. 
 'Cause from burial, it's a hop and a skip to homicide, but this is gonna build hope and make things worse. 
 Number one... 
 I f*cking told you so. 
 I get why she did what she did. 
 - Number two, I didn't send this. 
 - [SCOFFS] 
 You didn't send it. 
 What do you mean you didn't send it? 
 - I didn't f*cking send it. 
 - Then who did? 
 [SIGHS] 
 No. 
 It can't be them, though. 
 He didn't want money. 
 He flat out refused. 
 Because you didn't offer him enough. 
 He knew he could get    . 
 He just had to squeeze harder. 
 What if we're walking into a trap? 
 Is there a world where Dorothy does not go to the mall with a big bag of cash tomorrow night? 
 No, of course there f*cking isn't. 
 Then I suggest we put our stash to good use and go with the good old-fashioned method of paying these fuckers off. 
 f*ck. 
 [JULIAN SIGHS] 
 Oh, Julian, thank God. 
 Did you talk to Sean? 
 I saw the note. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Help me, will you? 
 I don't know what goes in which box. 
 We may have to mix and match here. 
 [SIGHS] 
 What a mess. 
 You know, I've always warned Sean, if you're not liquid, you're a pauper. 
 Do you think it's them? 
 Who else could it be? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Well, Sean seems to have his doubts, but I'm sure it is. 
 I mean, they know we have Leanne, so of course they'd make contact again now. 
 Sean overthinks everything. 
 It's them. 
 Is this gonna be enough? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Not even close. 
 That's why I'm gonna have to call in some favors. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 What's this? 
 You know me. 
 I always keep a little aside for a rainy day. 
 [GASPS] 
 Oh! 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] 
 Oh, I'm so thankful for my little brother. 
 Family first. 
 Always. 
 [DOROTHY CHUCKLES, KISSES] 
 Oh. 
 [MAN] 
 Welcome back to Channel   News. 
 In our next segment, 
 we have Isabelle Carrick 
 reporting from Philadelphia's newest restaurant. 
 [ISABELLE] 
 Thank you so much, Doug. 
 Love is in the air. 
 Thanks to our phones, 
 it's now easier than ever to find a dinner partner. 
 But at this new eatery in Center City ,  the idea of a blind date is taken quite literally. 
 They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, 
 but when no one can behold, where's the attraction? 
 In conversation? Touch? A gut feeling? 
 [BOTTLES RATTLING] 
 Even food tastes different when you can't see it. 
 I'm sitting here on my first blind date 
 with one of Philadelphia's most eligible bachelors, Frank Clemente. 
 He self-identifies as a picky dater... 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [SEAN] 
 Can you believe it? 
 [ISABELLE] 
 What made you try this... 
 Six hundred for a case of Ravello. 
 Well, every little drop helps. 
 But I paid  ,    for it. 
 If they'd given me a week, I could've got a fair price. 
 Well, then we wouldn't have Jericho for another week, would we? 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 Every little helps. 
 Are we close? 
 Oh, we're still about short. 
 Julian really came through for us, didn't he? 
 Yeah, he's a real sweetheart. 
 I already have an offer from Jason Taylor. 
 You remember what a fuss he made when he saw you carrying it in the house? 
 He's always coming from a spinning class. 
 I don't want him putting his sweaty hands all over it. 
 It will be painful, Sean, but I'm sure you'll weather it. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Shall I leave you alone for a moment while you say your goodbyes? 
 [SIGHS] 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] 
 [SIGHS] 
 You said I could be downstairs between  :   and   :  . 
 It's now   :  . 
 [OBJECT CLANGS] 
 [REFRIGERATOR HUMMING] 
 I would like to make a cake. 
 A cake? 
 These are the ingredients that I need. 
 [DOROTHY] 
 Sean! 
 Yeah, I'm... 
 I'm kinda pressed today. 
 Well, if you don't have time, you could ask Tobe to deliver them. 
 - I'll try. 
 - [DOROTHY] 
 Sean! 
 [SNIFFS, PANTING] 
 [GRUNTS, PANTING] 
 [SOBS] 
 [GRUNTS, PANTING] 
 How long's the drive? 
 Thirty minutes, but she wants to get there early. 
 - Leave nothing to chance. 
 - Yeah. 
 This just doesn't feel right. 
 You're paying a ransom for a baby that isn't yours. 
 - When would that ever feel right? 
 - Yeah. 
 [KNOCKS] 
 What the f*ck is Pillsbury Doughboy doing here? 
 I asked him to bring some stuff. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [BANGING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 [BANGING] 
 Were you in my closet? 
 You didn't specify any parameters to my walks. 
 - You took this. 
 [SIGHS] 
 - You have so many. 
 It looks better on her. 
 Thank you, Chef. 
 Are those the ingredients that I asked for? 
 [SEAN] 
 Uh-huh. 
 - Tobe. 
 - Hey. 
 Uh... 
 Uh, what are you making? 
 Cake. 
 [DOROTHY] 
 We should leave now. 
 - Traffic is moderate. 
 - [SEAN] 
 Yeah. 
 Will you help me? 
 Um... 
 Julian can watch over them. 
 But make sure Leanne doesn't overextend herself. 
 She's been through so much lately. 
 I... I won't stay long. 
 Yeah, I'll make sure of that. 
 
 
 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 You don't give them the bag until they hand over the baby. 
 And you don't let her out of your sight. 
 [SIGHS] 
 She doesn't leave until Jericho is home. 
 - [HORN HONKS] 
 - He's anxious. 
 Go get him. 
 Mm. 
 [ENGINE STARTS] 
 [CAR DOOR CLOSES] 
 What sort of cake you making? 
 Fruitcake. 
 I like chocolate best. 
 - More for us, then. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 So, what are we doing? 
 What, uh... 
 What are we making? 
 What's the recipe? 
 It's called a king cake. 
 It's technically for the Epiphany. 
 My mother used to make it on Sundays. 
 She taught me how, said I could use it for my pageants. 
 You were in pageants? 
 She said it could be my special skill because I didn't have any. 
 I never won. 
 Sean and Dorothy are heading your way. 
 What about the aunt and uncle? Are they gonna be here? 
 I'm not asking you to confront them. 
 Just hang back in the distance. 
 You have eyes on the food court? 
 Mm. 
 No closer than that. 
 You should be all right. 
 Call me when they show up. 
 [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] 
 Oh. 
 What happened? 
 I'm handling it. 
 Did those people who were holding you... 
 I... I don't wanna talk about that. 
 Sorry. 
 [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] 
 There's one more ingredient to a king cake. 
 He said it's just past the goddess fountain, so... 
 - [JULIAN SNIFFS] 
  - Oh, this is it. 
 
 - Sean, Sean, we're here. 
 - I see it. Uh... Well, we're five minutes early, so just sit down and... [SEAN] Okay. Maybe we'll order something. It's important to look casual. - [PHONE RINGS] - Hang on. I'm muting you. [RINGS] Roscoe? Your sister just showed up. [JULIAN] All right. I think we're ready. Sundays were the only day she got out of bed. For the cake. - We'd practice. She'd have the bottle. - The bottle? Of brandy. It's for the glaze. If she hadn't drunk it all yet. The rule was that if I did well in my last pageant, I got to put the baby inside. [EXHALES] I got to do it four times. - Only four times? - Yes. Go ahead. When it was time to eat it... my mother would put on her best dress. - She'd cut the cake for us. - [OVEN DOOR OPENS] She said whoever was most special would get the baby. [OVEN DOOR CLOSES] My mother was always the special one. How do you mean? She always found the baby. She would hold it up in her hand for me to see it. And then she'd make me say it. [SOBS] "You're the special one!"    Um, where's your mother now? Burning. - It's  :  . What should we do? - Just wait. The mall closes in    minutes. Well, then wait another    f*cking minutes then. - Where's Leanne? - She's baking. [SIGHS] This could be a trap. They might've wanted us out of the house -  so they could snatch her back. - Don't worry, okay? I'm on it. Just... stay online. [SIGHS] [JULIAN] What happened to your little friend? He had to leave. Dorothy said he couldn't stay long. He locked the door from the outside. Okay. Bedtime, Cinders. [SIGHS] I'm cleaning. I'll do that later. Will you take the cake out of the oven for me? To cool. I set the timer. You want me to f*cking ice it for you too? After it's cool. That's when we add the brandy glaze. Oh. Well, then maybe I will have a slice after all. [DOOR CLOSES] [KEY RATTLES IN LOCK] [LOCK CLICKS] Did he just lock you in? They think it's good for me. I'm adapting. [CHUCKLES] She's gone for a walkabout, see if she can recognize anyone. [SIGHS] She's fine. She's at a chocolate shop. That package, the little f*cking baby, that came through your account. They must have hacked it. These people don't strike me as technologically minded. They bind straw. Unless someone had access to your laptop. What's your password? Capital J-e-r-i-c-h-o. Jericho. Your son's name. And that's not f*cking obvious at all. I told you this doesn't feel right. They're not in it for the money. It's in your history, you dumb f*ck. If it wasn't you and it wasn't Dorothy, then who else had access to this? - Out! - [TOBE GRUNTS] Yeah. Why would you do that to her? She changed the bedsheets for him. She packed his little f*cking monkey. Because I wanna see her get what she deserves. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SIGHS] [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [DOOR CLOSES] [BEEPING] [SIGHS] They're making us leave. But we'll just go out to the parking lot. Maybe they'll feel safer to make contact out there, do you think? Julian? [GASPS, SCREAMS] Julian. [ROSCOE] Sorry, man. I can't handle this sh1t. [BEEPING] [BEEPING STOPS] [SIGHS] [DOOR HINGES CREAK] [SIGHS] - [LINE RINGS] - [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [RINGS] This is Sean. I can't come to the phone right now. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOROTHY SIGHS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Where is she? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS SOFTLY] [LIGHTS POPPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [BREATHING HEAVILY]
