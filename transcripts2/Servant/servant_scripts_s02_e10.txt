 Mr. Turner. 
 I understand you are looking for Jericho. 
 Who are you? 
 Aunt Josephine. 
 Can you take this and store it in a safe place? 
 It’s a gift for Leanne. Betamax player. 
 What about May and Uncle George? 
 They are not involved in this anymore. 
 May I come inside? 
 Wha– 
 You can trust me. 
 Dorothy Turner. 
 The warrior. 
 Who are you? 
 Aunt Josephine. 
 Aunt Josephine? 
 Aunt Josephine. 
 Where’s Jericho? 
 May we sit together? 
 I want to be by your side. 
 Have you done something to him? 
 No. 
 It must all be so confusing. 
 Come. 
 No person is meant to bear so much weight. 
 What are you doing? 
 Dorothy. 
 You were never meant to be part of this. 
 I know what you’ve done for your son. 
 The length you have gone to get him back, it’s breathtaking. 
 But it’s time to end this, isn’t it? 
 You deserve a chance at peace. 
 I don’t understand why you’re saying these things to me. 
 You don’t mean them. 
 If you did, you would have brought him to me. 
 I need an opportunity to see Leanne. 
 She’s in desperate need of my help. 
 No. 
 No, I won’t let you up there until my son is in my arms. 
 Unfortunately, this is the order in which it must be done. 
 We have our customs. 
 Dorothy, maybe we should consider– 
 No. 
 I won’t let you see her. 
 I won’t do this. Do you understand me? 
 I don’t want to play your games anymore. 
 You have fought for so long, haven’t you? 
 You can let go. 
 It’s all going to be all right now. 
 Dorothy, I think she’s here to help us. 
 You have 15 minutes with her and no more. 
 And then you’re telling me everything I wanna know. 
 And if you don’t, I’ll have you out of here and you’ll never see Leanne again, I swear to you. 
 It’s Jericho for Leanne. 
 That’s it. 
 There’s someone here to see you. 
 Tell me who it is. 
 She said she’s your aunt. 
 Tell me her name. 
 She called herself Aunt Josephine. They’re right behind me. 
 Please don’t leave me alone with her. 
 There she is. Our little Leanne. 
 Why do you wear that veil? 
 I would like to know what you want, Leanne. 
 I want to stay here with the Turners. 
 I’m afraid that’s not an option. 
 Why not? 
 You don’t belong here. 
 Yes, I do. 
 What do you believe? 
 That you can be happy here? 
 That this family loves you? 
 They don’t. 
 Leanne and I are leaving tonight. 
 I made you a promise that I want to keep. 
 What is this? 
 It’s the truth, dear. 
 Hey, Julian, something’s happened. I need you to call me back. 
 Dorothy? 
 What are you doing? Are you okay? 
 Open the door. 
 Dorothy. 
 f*ck. 
 What the hell? 
 Dorothy! 
 Dorothy! 
 Dorothy! 
 Is it prepared? 
 Yes. 
 What is it? 
 Your final warning. So pay attention. 
 Welcome, good people of the Church of the Lesser Saints. 
 They call me Uncle Frederick, and I will be guiding you through your reunion ritual. 
 We will show you how to return a lost member back to the light. 
 It requires practice, planning and precision. 
 The three P’s. 
 In order to help properly demonstrate, young cousin Marian… will be giving me a hand. 
 The ritual occurs in four steps. 
 The first step is the invocation. 
 See here our cousins in Lancaster performing the invocation. 
 We choose music that reminds us of a time on Earth that was important to us. 
 A time we fell in love, a time something good happened… 
 Then we hurt our flesh to separate ourselves from this false feeling. 
 Use any music you like. 
 Whatever makes you feel connected to your time on Earth here. 
 The next step is the consecration. 
 First, we blind them. 
 This can be done with a knife, hands or oil. 
 The next part of the consecration is to open up the flesh of the limbs. 
 And once you have sliced each limb as such with a heated blade, the soul is free to be released from the body to be reunited with God. 
 Dorothy! 
 Dorothy! 
 Only one step remains. 
 The emancipation. 
 You must burn the body in a hand-prepared pyre. 
 Ordinary branches and sticks can be used as kindling. 
 It’s important to complete these steps quickly and in order, otherwise the death may not take. 
 It may be difficult both physically and emotionally, but you must remind yourself why this is necessary. 
 Because when one of us goes bad… there is no turning back. 
 By acting now, you are saving innocent men and women. 
 And although they may have once been family, never forget who your adversary truly is. 
 Good luck to you, and may God bless you with his strength. 
 You made a decision to abandon your charge and come to this family. 
 I would like to know why. 
 Dorothy needed my help. 
 And have you helped her? 
 Yes. 
 But, Leanne, we are here for one purpose. 
 To serve him. 
 Come. Let’s see if you can be saved. 
 Dorothy! 
 No. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, no. 
 Oh, no. 
 No. 
 Heavenly Father, I have sinned against you. 
 I ask you to forgive me. 
 Come into my life and cleanse me of my own belief. 
 I give up my earthly possessions, and I open my heart to you, O Lord. 
 I ask you to reign my body for the purpose of your will. 
 I give up my earthly possessions, and I open my heart to you, O Lord. 
 I ask you to reign my body for the purpose of your will. 
 I will forget Dorothy Turner. 
 Something wrong, Leanne? 
 Why do I have to say that? 
 We have to be prepared to renounce everything. 
 We have no room for attachments. 
 Continue, Leanne. 
 I will forget Dorothy Turner. 
 I will forget Dorothy Turner. 
 It is a sin to covet someone, even a mother. 
 You lost your way, Leanne. 
 You must pay the price. 
 O Heavenly– O Heavenly Father– 
 What the f*ck? 
 Dorothy, open the f*cking door. 
 I’m not coming out of this room. 
 Why not? 
 They’ve killed him, Sean. 
 I’m getting… horrible feelings. 
 I’ve made a decision. 
 You don’t know that. 
 Trust me. You don’t wanna do this. 
 I want my baby. 
 Then you need to open the door. 
 Because then we can figure something out. 
 But we need to be together to do that. 
 I know you can’t possibly understand how a mother feels, Sean. 
 We’re the same soul. 
 I need to be with him. 
 But what about me? I need you. 
 What do I do? How do I breathe without you? 
 
 
 
 I’m so sorry. 
 I truly don’t mean to hurt you. 
 I hope you can forgive me for this. 
 I will never forgive you for this. Ever. 
 I swear. 
 It’s too late. I’ve already made the decision. 
 And what am I supposed to tell him if he’s still alive? 
 I’m supposed to tell him that you left him motherless because of– 
 Would you shut up? 
 I can’t do this with you yelling out there. 
 You won’t do that to your son. I know you won’t. 
 Heavenly Father, I will unite this child’s soul with her divine ruler. 
 Save her from her own evil and return her spirit to the light. 
 You will burn like the rest. 
 Jesus. 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh, Leanne. Leanne. 
 Did she hurt you? 
 No, I’m okay. I’m okay. 
 Put pressure on it. Here. 
 Sean, they’re down here! 
 Can you move? 
 Calm down. Take deep breaths. 
 Sean! 
 I’m gonna go get him… for help. 
 I’ll be one minute. And you call to me if you need me. 
 I’ll be right back. 
 Dorothy. 
 She wanted you to think he was gone. 
 What? 
 He’s not gone. 
 I’m gonna bring him back to you. 
 Oh, Leanne. 
 Thank you. 
 I’ll be right back. 
 Sean! 
 See? 
 She protected me. 
 Like I’m her daughter. 
 Vanity is a sin, Aunt Josephine. 
 Sean! They’re inside. I found them in the basement. 
 We’re getting him back, Sean. She’s agreed to it. 
 She’s gone to get him. 
 You don’t believe me. 
 That’s fine. You didn’t hear what she said. 
 You’ll see. 
 Leanne? 
 Leanne? 
 Any minute now. 
 Dorothy, I don’t think she’s bringing him back. 
 Have some faith in me, please. 
 I’m not the weak thing you think I am. 
 When you were in the nursery… and you said you had a bad feeling, like maybe you knew something… 
 Well, I was wrong. 
 Remember last August when I went to California and you were here alone for a week? 
 Sean, why are you telling me about a trip to California right now? 
 Because something happened. 
 But before I tell you that, I want you to know that this is real, and I’m here– 
 Sean, shut up. 
 No, I have to tell you this. 
 No, no, Sean, shut up. 
 Row, row, row your boat 
 Gently down the stream 
 It’s got to be someone else’s signal. 
 Life is but a dream 
 The itsy-bitsy spider Crawled up the waterspout 
 Down came the rain and Washed the spider out 
 Out came the sun 
 And dried up all the rain 
 Leanne? 
 The itsy-bitsy spider Went up the spout again 
 You okay? 
 London Bridge is falling down Falling down, falling down 
 What are you holding? 
 London Bridge is falling down 
 My fair lady 
 Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy. 
 Jericho. 
 We’re going to be a family now. 
 I don’t know why I keep doing bad things. 
 Scare myself sometimes. 
 I can feel the dark thing in me getting bigger. 
 But I’m tired of everyone telling me what’s wrong with me. 
 Maybe there’s nothing wrong. 
 Maybe this is who I am. 
 But I know how this works. 
 I know they’re coming for me. 
 But don’t worry. 
 I’ll be ready. 
 I know killing you started a war.
