 Here we are. 
 Dorothy? 
 The sedative I put in your pizza might unsettle your stomach,  so you should get down what you can. 
 How did I get--  -Tobe? 
 -Yes, your friend, Tobe, brought you. 
 I have to leave. 
 Where's Jericho? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, you'll stay here till you remember. 
 What if she needs the toilet? 
 I left a bucket and a roll of tissue. 
 We have three and a half bathrooms. 
 I need you to be on board with this. 
 It will only work if we're united. 
 -And what if she doesn't talk? 
 -She will. 
 Remember that heartbreaking piece I filmed in 2015 on drug rehabilitation? 
 You isolate the addict. 
 Remove all temptation. 
 You have to be firm and consistent. 
 And once they surrender  and they admit they don't know what's best,  that's when you know they're on the road to recovery. 
 She's not a junkie. 
 Heroin, religion, it's all the same beast. 
 Leanne has been under the influence of a cult for the majority of her life. 
 She's loyal to them. 
 We have to break that bond before she'll tell us where they're keeping Jericho. 
 It's that simple? 
 Under no circumstance must you go up there without me. 
 She will manipulate you. 
 You're not as strong as you like to think. 
 Call me if anything develops. 
 Look, honey, the builders are here. 
 See? 
 We're fixing everything. 
 -Guys. 
 -Morning. 
 How you doing? 
 Appropriating a baby was one thing,  but imprisoning an 18-year-old girl you've abducted in your attic  is a whole new level of skullfuckery. 
 She's not a prisoner. 
 Oh, no? 
 What is the correct legalese for this scenario? 
 I was wondering how this could be more relaxing. 
 Thank you. 
 It's my f*cking hand. 
 I keep forgetting about it. 
 You don't feel this at all? 
 Nothing. 
 It's like it's not even there. 
 You should see a doctor. 
 It sounds like you got a brain clot. 
 Why would it be a brain cl--  Has she said anything yet? 
 Little Anne Frank up yonder. 
 I can't get to her. 
 She could be telling Dorothy anything. 
 You think I don't f*cking know that? 
 If I could just talk to her, if I could just reason with her,  maybe she'll tell me where he is. 
 Or she's gonna lead Dorothy straight into the arms of Aunt Cuckoo. 
 She's not gonna help Dorothy. 
 You heard what she said about her to Tobe. 
 Peter Pan always said the key to flying is "Think happy thoughts."  But I had to go down to the King of Prussia wind tunnel  to really defy gravity. 
 I had to go to three different stores to find the tomato. 
 Someone must be buying in bulk for the winter. 
 I see you're making yourself at home. 
 These clothes are not for dress-up. 
 The family I was stationed with, the mother's very sick. 
 The little boy, Sergio, their family, they need me. 
 I feel sorry for them. 
 I made a commitment to them. 
 Yes, you also made a commitment to us. 
 You signed a contract. 
 I can't give Jericho to you. 
 Then you'll tell me where he is. 
 Maybe you'll feel differently tomorrow. 
 One day at a time. 
 She was quite petulant tonight. 
 She never used to be like that. 
 In fairness, we didn't have her locked up, pissing in a bucket before. 
 It's because she's away from their influence. 
 She doesn't know how to think for herself. 
 She's been brainwashed. 
 Maybe we could bring her down in the evening if we keep a close eye on her. 
 I have asked,  and she has repeatedly refused to tell me where Jericho is. 
 I just think--  We are so close to getting him home, and you want her to get her steps in. 
 Will you please, just this once, trust me to handle this in the correct way? 
 You need to bring him back. 
 I told you. 
 Why won't you do it? 
 Mrs. Turner. 
 Stop. 
 Stop. 
 I need him back! 
 God, you're hurting me! 
 I think I threw my back out flying yesterday. 
 -You were five feet off the ground. 
 -It's the same muscles. 
 Maybe I should take her breakfast up. 
 We have a strategy. 
 She might say something to me that she wouldn't say to you. 
 Why would she trust you and not me? 
 I don't know. 
 Sometimes you can be a--  I can be what? 
 Just let me see if I can get through to her. 
 One egg. 
 You'd spoil her if I'd let you. 
 -Just tell my car to wait, please. 
 -Sure. 
 Breakfast? 
 My mother used to make us start every day with an egg. 
 Be gentle with these decorations. 
 They've been here forever. 
 I'm surprised they even work. 
 Did you have a breakfast routine growing up, Leanne? 
 We had every meal together. 
 No matter what had happened that day,  we would all come together and share our stories. 
 Where's Jericho? 
 I wanna talk to Mr. Turner. 
 Whatever you can say to him, you can say to me. 
 Very well. 
 You won't come between us. 
 Sean and I are a family. 
 Something you've clearly never had. 
 Hello, Leanne. 
 You found Angela. 
 I call her Mrs. Barrington. 
 She was in our bedroom for a while, when we had the apartment at Rittenhouse. 
 She wore scarves mostly. 
 I didn't know she was going to do that. 
 Bring you here in that way. 
 Why haven't you told her? 
 It has to be one of you. 
 You don't know Dorothy. 
 You don't know what it would do to her. 
 She deserves whatever's coming her way. 
 If anyone wants to punish her, they can. 
 Because it cannot compare to what she would do to herself. 
 You want to help us, Leanne. 
 I know you do. 
 In return, let me help you. 
 Just tell me where he is. 
 And I'll give you anything you want. 
 I want to use the bathroom. 
 What happened to your hand? 
 It was an accident. 
 Does it hurt? 
 Agony. 
 The fight broke out earlier at this Germantown chicken joint. 
 When staff made the announcement  that their chicken sandwiches would be rationed to two per customer,  the scene turned ugly. 
 sh1t. 
 Yeah, baby. 
 Yeah! 
 Get him, baby! 
 -Come here! 
 -What are you doing? 
 That's not yours. 
 Hit him! 
 Hit him! 
 Where is he? 
 -Where is he? 
 -No! 
 You took him away from me! 
 You tell me where he is! 
 You sleep okay? 
 I get panicky at 2:00 a.m. 
 It's like my body seems to be remembering something my mind forgot. 
 So strange it's always 2:00, don't you think? 
 I feel like it's about Jericho. 
 Maybe we should talk to Natalie, get her to prescribe you something. 
 Yeah. 
 You'd like that. 
 Turn me into a zombie. 
 That's not what I said. 
 Sorry, darling. 
 I'm just tired. 
 How did we sleep? 
 I used to pray for you, Dorothy. 
 Not anymore. 
 Well, that's good, because we no longer allow superstition in this house. 
 You can make this stop, Leanne, anytime you like! 
 Century eggs. 
 They soak them in tea. 
 That's what gives them the color. 
 We didn't start trying till we were in our mid-30s. 
 It would have been career suicide for her to do it any earlier. 
 That's why she blames herself for all that's happened. 
 We'd almost given up. 
 I don't know why I'm telling you this. 
 It's because you want me to feel sorry for her. 
 Or understand her a bit better. 
 The truth is, I'll tell you whatever you wanna hear if we can get him back. 
 Who? 
 Don't play games. 
 I know you're a good person. 
 I know what you did for us. 
 Tell me who you're looking for. 
 Jericho. 
 We want Jericho back. 
 
 
 
 Jericho died, Mr. Turner. 
 Julian's secret blend of herbs and spices. 
 As long as it's not weed. 
 I don't need Dorothy high. 
 When did she start on the bourbon again? 
 She has one a night. 
 I hate those people. 
 It's a level of self-control I can't abide. 
 We can't let this go on much longer. 
 She's terrified up there. 
 You got in to see her? 
 But she's not saying anything. 
 And she won't. 
 Not as long as she's a prisoner. 
 We're not the bad guys here. 
 No? 
 What are we? 
 We're the victims. 
 Isn't that obvious? 
 "May the Lord judge between me and you. 
 May the Lord avenge me upon you, but my hand shall not be against you. 
 As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes wickedness,'  but my hand shall not be against you. 
 Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave  and called after Saul, 'My lord the king!'  When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth,  and did obeisance. 
 And David said to Saul, 'Why do you listen to the words of men who say,  "Behold, David seeks to do you harm"?'"  Of course it's the children that you have to cry for. 
 I mean, if an adult wants to sign away their free will to a religious scam,  then good luck to them,  but a child's mind is so delicate, so--  What's the word for something that takes everything else in? 
 Porous. 
 It'll come to me. 
 It's definitely porous. 
 What if I go up there and play bad cop? 
 No, no. 
 That's very sweet of you, but no. 
 I've got Leanne right where I want her. 
 First rule of journalism, you ask a simple question  and then you keep repeating it until you get your answer. 
 But just promise me that when we find him,  you'll leave negotiations to me. 
 I'm very good at keeping emotion out of things. 
 I won't get on my knees, like some of us. 
 -What's this? 
 -Nothing. 
 He didn't tell you? 
 The uncle confronted him in the cellar at the baptism. 
 Forced him to pray. 
 Pray? 
 Pray for what? 
 I don't remember. 
 Did you put Scotch bonnets in this? 
 Nice try. 
 But this recipe will go with me to the grave. 
 No, it's something. 
 Naga Viper. 
 And you mixed it with peperoncini. 
 That's how you get the sweetness with the kick. 
 Pasta's overcooked, but anyone can tell that. 
 You guessed. 
 Darling. 
 You can taste. 
 Turmeric. 
 For your under-eye circles. 
 What under-eye circles? 
 -Any day now, she's talking. 
 -You think? 
 We're deprogramming her. 
 As long as that's all we're doing. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 I just wanna be sure we're not crossing any lines. 
 -Have you been up there? 
 -Of course I haven't. 
 I love charcuterie. 
 It's got everything. 
 Salt, bitter, umami. 
 Must be a relief to taste again. 
 Came back just like that. 
 If Dorothy sees you have that... 
 She'll what? 
 Let me do something for you, Leanne. 
 If I take you back to your family, would you like that? 
 I can't tell you where he is. 
 You don't have to. 
 You could just bring him home. 
 -I know you can. 
 -Sean? 
 I'm home. 
 Better not let her find you in here, Mr. Turner. 
 Where is he? 
 He's in a better place. 
 Surrounded by people that love him. 
 We keep him warm, and we keep him happy. 
 And we keep him safe. 
 Safe from you. 
 Gee... 
 I'm burning. 
 Dorothy! 
 Dorothy! 
 sh1t. 
 Dor--  Dorothy? 
 Where is she? 
 What did you do with--  What did you do? 
 She wouldn't tell me. 
 This is too far. 
 Nothing is too far. 
 Dorothy. 
 Dorothy. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Do you want any help? 
 I can manage. 
 She's not a bad person. 
 She just loves him that much. 
 You can feel it again, can't you? 
 Your hand. 
 And that's why you woke up and found me?
