 [JULIAN] 
 We're at the Grayson house. 
 Looks like there was a fire. 
 [ISABELLE] 
 Just a few minutes ago, 
 the body of the youngest Marino child was found. 
 Only ten-years-old, 
 he appeared to have been shot by his own father. 
 Let's make a deal here, George. 
 You can have Leanne, but we want our son back. 
 The answer has come. 
 She must see the tape now. 
 She needs to know. 
 [FOOTSTEPS THUMPING] 
 - [DOROTHY ON TV] 
 And what's your name? 
 - Chloe. [DOROTHY ON TV] Chloe. Well, best of luck to you, Chloe. Uh, of course we have to thank all the moms and the aunts who traveled from far away to be with their daughters today, stitching dresses, painting faces. I think we have time to meet one more contestant who's down here on the end twiddling her thumbs. What's your name, pretty lady? Leanne. Leanne, very nice to meet you. Where were you born? Wisconsin. [TAPE REWINDING] ... the best of luck as they head into the talent portion of the competition. I'm Dorothy Turner,   News. [WOMAN] You're ruining this for me. Get up. [CLICK] [HEAVY BREATHING] [CREAKING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [TYPING] [PHONE CHIMES, VIBRATES] [CHIMES, VIBRATES] - This is Julian. - He's not answering. He must have slipped out this morning. [SIGHS] Are they ready yet? Almost. - Et voilà. - Great. Dorothy, are you sure that means what we think it means? [SIGHS] Of course. What else could it possibly mean? [SOBS] [SOBBING] [SOBS] [SOBS, PANTS] [KNIFE SCRAPING] [KNOCKING] [DOROTHY] George. Breakfast. [CLEARS THROAT] Oh. So, I ordered your Betamax player. They are forecasting    inches,    but Stuart, our FedEx man, is very hardy. Midwestern stock. And if he could deliver our credenza in Hurricane Sandy,    then surely he can deliver a Betamax in this. [SIGHS] I know this tape is very important to you. I wanna help however I can. We made a deal. What is this? It was in your box. It must've fallen. I figured it might mean something to you. Then you know. It is time. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [DOROTHY] It's right this way. Dorothy, how'd it go? Good. I think. He's asked to use the grill. My grill? For what? I don't know. He just asked. - Don't look at me like that, please. - I'm not. I've got this under control. [SIGHS] [KNOCKING] [SIGHS] Leanne? I was at your house. Or what's left of it. If you ever wanted to talk to someone... you know you can talk to me. [SNIFFS] [WOMAN VOCALIZING] [WOMAN SINGING] [SINGING CONTINUES] [SINGING CONTINUES] Having a tea party, are we? You're making fun of me. [CHUCKLES] What do you want, Julian? That whole charade with the door and the music... you're not slick. [SIGHS] And I'm only here because you want me to be. You said if I wanted to talk. Yeah. I did say that. Okay, shoot. I don't know where to start. Well, you can start with her. That feels like some... deep sh1t. She reminds me of my mother. They have the same eyes. [SIGHS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [WATER RUNNING] - [DOROTHY] Hello. - [ROSCOE] Hi. - [DOROTHY] May I help you? - [ROSCOE] I'm looking for Sean. [DOROTHY] Sean? Um, darling, this man says he knows you. [GRUNTS] Are you sure you want to sit out here? It's awfully cold. That's all right. This is perfect. Who's he looking for? - Oh, we have a guest staying with us. - Mm. So... how do you two know each other? It's not often I haven't met such a good friend of Sean's. Sean, you wanna take that? [SEAN] He's a private investigator. Julian and I hired him to look into Leanne. Oh, Sean. You didn't. I thought she had a shady past. Clearly, I was way off base. Don't you think you should have shared that with me? That our nanny was under investigation. Well, I didn't want to involve you. Well, I just feel like a fool. Well, now that I'm in the loop, you better tell me everything. Anything that might help us understand why they took Jericho. Uh, I'm not sure I have anything. How is that possible? When you looked into Leanne, what did you find? Not much. Just a burnt up, old farmhouse. Some kind of tragic accident. [JULIAN] How close is your mother with your aunt and uncle? Is he her brother? George and May are my chosen family. We're not actually related. They said that God sent them     walking down the road where I was buried in ash. They told me that God had given me a second chance. [DOROTHY] Every detail we can learn about these people is important. All information, no matter how seemingly insignificant. It's Journalism    . - [DOROTHY SIGHS] - You okay? - [DOROTHY] I'm fine. - [SEAN] Let me get you a drink. - I said I'm fine. - I'll get it. Please... let me. This is my fault. - What is this? - [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Found them up here. [JULIAN] Mm, must've been our mom's. [WOMAN SINGING] [LEANNE] We're not supposed to listen to music. They say it's a dark temptation. But I don't understand that. Just feels like light to me. I wanna show you something. [SINGING CONTINUES] From some local news archive. [DOOR CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] [LEANNE] Look at how she's holding me. It's like she wants to drop me. Dorothy would never hold Jericho like that. What's Dorothy gotta do with it? I used to think she was the perfect mother. She was so beautiful. Gentle. Was nothing like mine. But I was wrong about her. That's f*cking unfair. What happened with the baby was an accident. It wasn't her fault. - Then whose fault was it? - [SIGHS] I'd probably blame God. If I thought there was a God to blame. For now, it's on me. I thought it would be safer to keep it from you,     and that was a mistake. We cannot lie to each other, Sean. Promise me. Ooh, sorry. Had to hit the restroom on the way. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. [HEAVY BREATHING] [BREATHING CONTINUES] [CHANTING LOW, INDISTINCT] [CHANTING LOW, INDISTINCT] - [DOROTHY] 
 
 Hey, Juju, it's Dottie. Um... - [JERICHO CRYING] I really wouldn't call if it wasn't important, but, um... [CRYING] I'm just having a really hard time. Um... Jericho's just crying and crying, and I have tried everything, and, uh... Um, I'm just really overwhelmed right now. [SNIFFLES] So... maybe you could just come by... Juju, for, like, even a couple hours. Um... Okay. Just call me back, okay? Bye. Why didn't you go? [JULIAN] My dealer scored some great sh1t. I couldn't pass that up. She was alone with his body for four days. All I can think is... [SIGHS] ...what if I went? Why are you telling me this? What do you want? Do you want me to feel sorry for her? No. It's just when a terrible thing happens... and you pretend that it didn't... it eats your insides. There was this green dress that my mother loved... so I decided to destroy it. Try maybe make some room for her to love me. I put it on the burner. Didn't know how fast fire grows. I wasn't even scared at all. I was just angry. It felt like I was burning too. [CLICKS TONGUE] My aunt and uncle said that it must've been God working through me. That terrible things happen for a reason. Do you think that? I think that if that's God... [SIGHS] then I don't want anything to do with him. He'll never leave this house without her. So our deal is safe as long as we still have Leanne. [SIGHS] All right. Let's go inside. It's frigid. Uh, I can grab you a blanket. That's very kind of you, Roscoe, but it's okay. We need to check on George. It's just nice, the fresh air. I thought we might stay out here for a little longer. I really am cold, but we can continue speaking in the kitchen. Roscoe, what are you doing? I can't let you inside. Why not? He told me to keep you out here until sunset... no matter what. Who? George. [SCOFFS] What do you think you're doing? I told you I wanted to help you! What, did you think you could trick us? You could just walk out of the house     without fulfilling your side of the deal? Huh? Tell me! I needed time to prepare. We must do these things alone. - Prepare? - Yes. We should all be ready. The reunion will happen when the clock turns. This is certain. Good. It better. - [ROSCOE] I'm sorry, man. - [SEAN] Just go. You don't understand. Listen to me, Sean. You know me. You know I'm a rational man. Something's happening to me. Things are changing. They're shifting for the better. What do you mean? I can't explain it. All I know is that it started when I met him. So when he asked me for a simple, harmless task,     I knew I needed to say yes. Roscoe, you need to go. I'm trying to say that you can trust them. They're not like us. They're special. [CHUCKLES] I'm not supposed to do that. They say that anything that feels good is dangerous. ["LOVE SHACK" PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [GROANS] [WATER RUNNING] [RECORDER BEEPS, CLICKS] [ISABELLE] Christmas has always been a time for sitting on Santa's lap and whispering wishes into his ear. But now child psychologists say that this encourages manipulative behavior. They argue that children should be encouraged to state their wishes directly without playing games. [PANTING] - [MOANS] - [PANTS] [BOTH MOAN] [SOBBING] [SOBBING] [PANTS] [PANTING] [BELL TOLLING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [BELL TOLLING CONTINUES] [TOLLING STOPS] [CREAKING] [CREAKS] [WIND WHISTLING] [GEORGE] I can't do it. Why are you holding that knife? Do you wanna hurt me? You said that you loved me. [GASPS] [LEANNE] Everybody lies to me. She'll come for you. Let her. I can handle May. Not May. [GRUNTS] [THUDS] [FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING] [WHIMPERING] Oh, my God. Where did you come from? Sir? Sir, are you okay?
