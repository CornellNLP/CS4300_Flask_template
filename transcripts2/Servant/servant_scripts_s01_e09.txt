 You got it. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There you go. 
 Oh, my God. I can't. 
 I can't. I can't do it. You had it. It's over. 
 You did it. Oh, my God. Is he okay? 
 Hey, it's okay. 
 Good job. Yes. Congratulations. 
 Is he breathing? Is he okay? Yeah, he's breathing. 
 He's perfect. Let me see. 
 Jericho. 
 Wow, this is beautiful. Did you discuss keeping the placenta? 
 Keeping it? 
 Yeah, some people pay for an encapsulation process. 
 It can help with postpartum depression. 
 You ready? Here we go. Here we go. 
 There we... Hi! 
 Okay, ready? Look over here. 
 You're mad. You're mad. 
 We end tonight with some really good news. Take a look at this. 
 Our very own Dorothy Turner posted a picture of herself with her newborn son today. 
 The baby came into the world 11 days ago and weighed in at seven pounds, three ounces. 
 I hear that she named him Jericho. 
 That's right. That's right. A beautiful name for a beautiful baby. 
 Yeah. Congratulations, Dorothy. 
 And from all of the team, we can't wait to have you back with us. 
 Of course, when you're good and ready. 
 You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 So, when did they want you? 
 August. For a week. 
 You know, judging, tasting, picking a winner. 
 So, California. So, this is television. 
 Yeah, some basic cable network. I don't even think we get it here. 
 Why are you being so weird about this? 
 I don't think I'm being weird about it. 
 Do you think I'll be jealous? 
 Do I need to remind you? I'm on television every single day. 
 Not anymore. 
 I am five weeks in from a drug-free vaginal home birth. 
 Why don't you give me a little bit of credit? 
 Why don't you put him down for a nap and give me some help? 
 I'll organize, you carry. 
 This is making me dizzy. 
 They're organic. 
 Why Jericho? What does it mean? Biblically speaking. 
 It doesn't mean anything. It's just a great name. 
 Is it a name that gets pussy? I don't know. 
 I think you may have condemned your son to the life of the collar. 
 "City of Moon." 
 You're right. It doesn't mean sh1t. 
 So, when does the nanny arrive? 
 I don't know. I haven't chosen one yet. 
 And they're all so young. I don't know if I can trust them. 
 Yeah, but you don't want a bag of old bones bossing you around. 
 You want someone servile. If she just so happens to be hot... 
 Here, I can't have any more of this. 
 Take this, all of it. You're bad for me. 
 Bye. Bye. 
 Bye, baby. 
 Hey. Hey. Where you headed? 
 I know. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 Okay, here. 
 Here we go. 
 Can you hold that for me? Okay. 
 Hey. 
 And the gourmet who goes home is... 
 Chef Philip. 
 Chef Sean? 
 Your beetroot chips were acidic, and the lemon was sweet. 
 The coconut crust was a great way to introduce texture to the lamb, but they don't belong on the plate together. 
 So... your journey is over. 
 It's 97.2. 
 Perfect! 
 You can still be sick and not have a fever. 
 If you're worried, take him to the ER. 
 Do you want me to look hysterical? 
 Look, you gotta tell 'em you need more cake makeup. 
 You look exhausted. 
 Because I'm f*cking exhausted. 
 Oh, please. Don't go there, okay? 
 It is 300 degrees. I would kill to be at work right now. 
 I gotta feed him every half hour. He's up all night. And no one to help me. 
 Well, how about Uncle Julian steps up for a f*cking change? 
 I think he's using again. I don't wanna bother him. 
 I'll be back Monday. 
 Why don't you and Jericho drive out to the airport? 
 He'll sleep all the way 'cause he loves the car, and you can both be there to meet me. 
 It's all about you, isn't it? Dor... 
 Okay. Come on, buddy. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Your chocolate delice isn't set properly, and this marshmallow is offensive. 
 You needed to torch it, so we got some of the bitterness. 
 You didn't do that, and then you go and cover it in gold leaf? 
 It's like polishing a turd. 
 Don't listen to that horrible man. 
 Chef, hang up your knife. 
 Hi. You okay? You okay? 
 Mine, mine, mine. 
 Okay. 
 Chef Sean. 
 I couldn't feed this to my dog. 
 You're a disgrace to this profession. Do you even wanna be here? 
 Yes. 
 Chef Drew. 
 Chef, I just have a question. Do you know what salt is? 
 Of course I know what salt is. 
 You sure? 
 Chef Mason, hang up your knife. 
 Leanne. Is everything okay? 
 Your car alarm's been going off for a half hour. 
 I couldn't find the keys. 
 Sean. It's Tuesday. Fish market in Richmond. 
 Keys. Keys. Where are the keys? 
 Mrs. Turner. 
 Well, you're fertile again. 
 Soon Jericho can have a little sister to love and protect. 
 Yeah. 
 I can do that, Leanne. I'm quite capable. 
 I like to be busy. 
 Yes, I've noticed you've been helping Sean a lot in the kitchen as well. 
 Hasn't gone unnoticed. 
 I've learned a lot from watching him. He's very... 
 Talented, yes. 
 As long as you have time for everything else. 
 Have I not been paying enough attention to Jericho? 
 That's not what I'm saying, Leanne. Don't put words in my mouth. 
 I'll never get back to sleep now. 
 Well, if we're quiet, we'll have another hour or so before Jericho wakes. 
 Maybe I can try Sean's omelet recipe with the cayenne pepper? 
 I know how much you like it. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 No. I'd like to. 
 You're up early. 
 I'm making breakfast for Mrs. Turner. 
 Put cayenne in it yet? 
 I was about to. No, don't. 
 She likes the idea of spicy food, but, in reality, it doesn't agree with her, so... 
 As long as she believes it's there, she swears she can taste it. 
 Hey, just change your hand. 
 Leanne. 
 Service. 
 Wasn't a crime. 
 Police said it happens more than you think. Forty times a year. 
 It can happen to anyone. 
 I need to take this up while it's still hot. 
 Thanks, Leanne. You can just leave it on the bed. 
 Are you going to the gym? 
 No. I wish. 
 We're doing a piece on the renovation of a municipal pool, and some half-wit producer thinks it'd be fun to stick me in the water. 
 I don't know. Maybe I'll stop on the way to work and pick up something new. 
 Treat myself. 
 I think that looks great on you, Dorothy. 
 You're so sweet. 
 And everyone knows you've just given birth. 
 They'll be expecting you to be carrying a little extra baby weight. 
 Plain egg white omelet with cayenne. 
 If it's not soft in the middle, I can do it again. 
 Dorothy? 
 I'm driving in. 
 I got deliveries! I need your car. 
 I need it more. 
 I don't know. I just smelled something rotten and I just... 
 I tried to warn you I had to take those into the city today. 
 Please tell me no one was filming that. 
 No one saw. 
 Did you get any on the fish? 
 I'm dying. 
 You're not dying. You're just a little sick. 
 
 
 
 It's something you ate. 
 Are you going to call work for me, babe? 
 I'll sort everything out. Just let it all out. 
 Like a reverse sh1t. 
 That's it. 
 I don't know what you expect me to do with it. 
 He's not back until Monday. 
 Order says Friday. 
 My husband's gonna be so pissed with you guys. 
 Sean! 
 2019 Gourmet Gauntlet champion. 
 Congratulations. 
 Chef Mary Ann, cooking is about heart. 
 To be the best, you must leave no room to love anything else. 
 Bravo, darling. 
 I had to say that nine f*cking times. I never wanna be on television again. 
 Thank you. This means so much to me. 
 I'm finally gonna get to open my brunch place, and my daughter, Doris, is gonna be so excited. 
 Come home. 
 Thank you. 
 What? 
 Yeah. Sure. You know that. Monday. I got this after-party episode. 
 Thank you. Congratulations. 
 You okay? 
 I can open my own place. Thank you, guys. 
 Of course I am. 
 Her dish was like air. 
 Maybe it is time we hired some help. 
 Oh, here I am. 
 Aw, baby, baby, it's okay. Come here. 
 Come here. 
 Mommy's got you. 
 All right, buddy. 
 Okay. 
 It's all right. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. Mama's here. Mama's here. All right, bubba... 
 Jesus. 
 The two million dollar renovation has certainly attracted its fair share of controversy. 
 But this weekend, doors will finally be open again, and swimmers will be able to see exactly where that investment went. 
 I asked some local humans what this means to them. 
 How you feeling? 
 Good ol' Isabelle subbing in for me. 
 She's pretty. 
 Of course she is. We have to be. 97.2. 
 Perfect. 
 Come sit with me. I'm bored. 
 I can't. I'm in the middle of a dish. 
 You used to ask me to taste your work. 
 You used to say you loved my palate. 
 Good thing you're sick today. You're better than this sh1t. 
 This is Isabelle Carrick in Roxborough. 
 Come on! 
 Can I borrow you for five? 
 Unfortunately blowfish has somewhat of a bad reputation. 
 Contains tetrodotoxin, which is 1,200 times more deadly than cyanide. 
 So, when you prepare it you gotta be extra careful. 
 Make sure you don't nick any of the organs. 
 'Cause if they bleed into the flesh, you could get sick and die. 
 I need to know how it tastes. 
 Describe it for me. 
 It's sharp. 
 And then bitter. 
 This is ceviche. 
 Dates back to the Incas. 
 Cooked without heat. In all but physics, it's raw. 
 I don't like it. Try again. 
 I need to know why you don't like it. 
 Why did you stay with her? 
 After what she did. 
 Because it was an accident. 
 It was a mistake, and people make mistakes, Leanne. 
 She stayed with him for four days, just the two of them. 
 Waiting for me to come home and help. 
 If I'd been here, none of that would have happened. That was my mistake. 
 Tastes like bruised fruit. 
 Like an apple that's been in the sun too long. 
 Come. 
 It's okay, my love. 
 Oh, my... 
 Oh, my life. 
 Yeah. 
 Let me take him. What? 
 Let me take him. 
 I was handling it, Leanne. 
 You've been sick, Dorothy. 
 You don't want Jericho to catch your bug. 
 Yes, you're right. 
 Of course. 
 Do what's best for the baby. 
 Always.
