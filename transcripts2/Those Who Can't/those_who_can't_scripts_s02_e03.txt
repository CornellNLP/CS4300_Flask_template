 [Cheers and applause] 
 Whoo! Smoot, Smoot! Woop, woop! 
 Smoot, Smoot! Woop, woop! Yeah! 
 All right! 
 This Friday, you Tariffs are gonna do something on this field that has not been done in 15 years... beat Chatwood High! Whoo! 
 14 years! '02 was canceled on account of lighting. 
 I'm sorry. Did I make marmalade, Martha? 
 Not excuses... What? Sss! 
 [Chuckles] That was good, though. 
 Now, I want you to help me welcome the living legend, former Denver Broncos placekicker Mr. "Iron Toe" Todd Timmons! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 What?! Are you serious?! 
 [Cheers and applause continue] 
 Iron Toe! 
 Everybody make some noise for your new head football coach! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Iron Toe's our new head coach?! 
 Oh, my God! 
 That is... disgusting the way you people react and figure some knuckle-dragging Neanderthal graces us with his presence... 
 Hey! Iron Toe is second to no one, bro. 
 He got kicked out of the AFC championship game for tripping. 
 You can get thrown out of a game for tripping? 
 Yeah, on acid, you can. He was out of his mind. 
 Blasting it east-west, He didn't know what he was doing. 
 Now, I have given Iron Toe complete authority over Smoot in exchange for a guaranteed victory! 
 Guaranteed! 
 That's what I'm talking about! Broncos style, y'all. 
 And let me tell you what. 
 It's great to be on the field again. 
 What's your name there, Radio? 
 Go, Brady! 
 Brady! 
 Brady! 
 Go, Brady! 
 Brady. 
 All right, Brady. Tell you what. 
 How would you like to hold that ball... 
 Brady. while I belt that son of a bitch 60 yards? 
 Would that be a hoot or what? 
 Uh... I don't really... 
 All right, let's do it! Hey!

 I clip your wing there, milquetoast? 
 What are you, sick or something? 
 I have celiac disease, but it's actually pretty easy to manage. 
 [Chanting] Iron Toe! Iron Toe! 
 Iron Toe made a dying kid's wish come true! 
 Whoo! 
 Hey, it's just celiac disease. 
 This feels like a dream. 
 Oh, you're not dreaming, Fairbell. 
 This is a [bleep]damn mile-high miracle.

 Stuffed Bill Romanowski into a circus cannon, shot him right into a fourth-floor window of the Patriots' hotel.

 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Whatever, whatever. 
 Smoot Pride. 
 Mr. Iron Toe... Loren Payton. I'm your biggest fan. 
 Your "30 for 30: East by East-West"... that's not just a documentary, that is art. 
 Did you even know that you were kicking east-west? 
 I didn't even know I was playing football. 
 [Laughter] 
 Wow. In my spare time, um, I like to draw up football plays. 
 And, look, I know I'm not in the NFL or anything... 
 Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup. 
 If you're asking me to have a look at 'em... 
 I'd be honored. 
 He's a saint. 
 Are you serious? 
 You got it. 
 He's a saint. 
 My goodness! 
 Did you hear that? 
 Coach Toe, what else can we do to secure a win?! 
 You know, if I had free rein here at Smoot, the first thing I would do is I'd get our eight All-District players off of academic probation, back out on that field. 
 Well, that's a great idea, little buddy! 
 Tell you what. 
 Why don't you go ahead and do that for me? 
 Yeah, okay, I will. 
 The only problem is that road runs right through, uh, Shoemaker's class. 
 See, he's failing every one of 'em. 
 Damn right I am. 
 Those kids tried to get the Smoot Jazz Club to take all their tests. 
 As long as I'm here, those steroid Sherpas will never play... guarantee you that. 
 You know what? I think I got a quick fix for this. 
 What's that? 
 You're fired. 
 [Laughter] 
 What? 
 Why are you laughing? You can't fire me! 
 Under what authority? 
 Cattie, tell him he can't fire me. 
 I can't hear a ghost! You're dead to me!

 What do you mean what am I doing? I'm becoming you! 
 That and I'm wearing about five pounds of makeup from the guy who did "Leprechaun Five." 
 Now give me your substitute teacher orders! 
 Wait, no! No! Aah!

 [High-pitched voice] Ha ha ha! I'm just kidding with you. I was joking. 
 Yeah, it's just so hard to hear in here, because your hair has so much volume. 
 May I touch yours? 
 Of course you can. [Laughs] 
 Speaking of coarse... like a reservation dog or something. 
 [Laughs] I'm being so basic right now. 
 Oh, my God! I love you! 
 You're such a Shosh!

 Oh, from the TV show "Girls."

 That's something that Shoshanna would say! 
 Yes! Oh, my God, yes. I love "Girls." 
 But not like that, not like that at all. I mean, I love  being  a girl. 
 Yes, and bleeding and not having a weird pen1s. 
 Oh.

 Girl, I have seen the weirdest pen1s. 
 Oh, you don't say.

 Oh! [Laughs] 
 Everyone off your knees! 
 All right, come on! Get up.

 Actually, I think that we're legally obligated to keep those spots available... 
 Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh! Tell you what.

 Just shut up. 
 Fuzz butter... grab that printer, load her into my truck. 
 Roger. Got it! 
 Hey, I don't know if it's gonna fit, 'cause we put all those computers in there. 
 Just jam it in there!! You're my man, okay? 
 Gotcha. 
 All right. 
 Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. So, you're stealing our printers? 
 Look, just who in the... 
 Hello, gorgeous. 
 What? 
 No, I'm, uh, not stealing them. 
 I need them to print up some playbooks.

 It's good to be back in Bronco Country.

 I should probably get to class now.

 Listen, perhaps you should be a little more mindful of those who aren't here to defend themselves! 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 "Ma'am"?

 Oh, hey there, dollface. 
 I just need a minute in Shoemaker's desk, then I'll be out of hair. Okay, babe? Sound good?

 Ring a bell? 
 No. 
 You know, I was about six Fat Tires deep. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Could have been a dude for all I knew at that point. 
 [Laughs] 
 Too close. 
 Hey, wait, how did you know I'm named "Loren" if we've never hooked up? 
 Oh, well, because... everybody knows that Loren is the coolest guy in school. 
 Yeah, that does check out. 
 Yeah. 
 Tracey, you seem pretty chill. I need a favor. 
 My friend is "Iron Toe" Todd Timmons... 
 Well, unfortunately, your friend is a douche bag, so there will be no... 
 Excuse me? 
 Excuse you. 
 Iron Toe is not a douche bag. He's a Denver Bronco. 
 And you will show the appropriate respect [bleep]damn it. 
 I will show nothing of the sort! 
 Ow! 
 What I will do is take my power back as a woman! 
 So you take your oppressive pen1s and your power-hungry male ego and you just step on out that door, 'cause I am woman, hear me roar!

 Oh, you look great!

 Yeah!

 I feel that every day. 
 No, you don't. 
 Yes, I do! Every man here is obsessed with me! 
 Well, it doesn't matter anymore, 'cause I am gonna get Iron Turd. 
 I'm gonna go report him, and they'll have to believe me. 
 I'm the female victim here.

 It's like it's your first day as a woman! 
 What? 
 You think they'll believe us over a famous athlete? 
 Yes. They have to. 
 [Laughing] That's hilarious! 
 Okay, well, then I'll have to get hard evidence. 
 Uh-huh. 
 That'll bring Shoemaker back. 
 Why are you so obsessed with Shoemaker? 
 He's gone. It's more like "Whomaker."

 Yeah, women are funny. That's good. 
 No, I've seen a lot of people really missing him around here, yeah.
