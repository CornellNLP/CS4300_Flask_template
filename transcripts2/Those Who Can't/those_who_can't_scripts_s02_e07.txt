 E-everyone's reading my "Turgid"... 
 Shhh! 
 "Brock Ranger turned to his girlfriend, Jade Phoenix, but Jade didn't turn back." 
 No. 
 "She just kept pedaling her dope-ass bike further and further and further away, deep into the freezing, turgid dawn." 
 "Deep into the freezing, turgid dawn." 
 Wow. That is... 
 Yeah? 
 ... really impressive. 
 You really think so? 
 Yeah. It's total garbage, but it's impressive that a Smoot student wrote it. 
 It's not total garbage. 
 What makes... what makes you think a student wrote it? 
 Well, it's either a student or the world's most stunted adult. 
 No, it's clearly written by a high-schooler with an elementary-schooler's view of sexuality. 
 Okay, I think the author knew a lot more about sexuality than that, Abbey. 
 Brock is a metaphor for the human condition... 
 [Laughing] Oh, yeah. 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
 No, but, seriously, I would love to meet the kid who wrote this. 
 It's like a bona fide literary phenomenon. 
 Like "On the Road"? 
 No, like "Goosebumps."

 Yeah.

 Enjoy. 
 Those things are flying off of the shelves.

 Great. I should have known. 
 Yeah, these kids are reading. 
 Oh, is that what you call it... reading? 
 She don't have pockets inside of her pants, Trevor! 
 [Chuckling] Badass. 
 You know what we're looking at here? 
 A bona fide literary phenomenon, like "On the Road"? 
 No, how about a potential outbreak of pregnancies? 
 It's an adventure novel, Cattie. 
 There's no s*x in it. 
 It's that great period before the s*x. 
 Why don't you shut those red lips, Mapplethorpe, okay? 
 We got to do something about this smut. 
 I'm already on thin ice with the school board because of that scathing article during the Quinn trial. 
 Hey, do you guys have a copy of that crazy, stupid novel that everybody's reading... 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 "Detergent Dawn" or whatever? 
 Yeah, the one everyone's petting ... each other's bumps over? 
 Whoa. 
 See, that's what I'm talking about, y'all! 
 Okay, it's "The Turgid Dawn," and no one knows if a kid wrote it... an adult could have written it. 
 Probably, an adult wrote it. 
 Okay, if an adult wrote it, then how come, on page 34, when they're talking about young ladies, Brock says to Hawk, uh, he don't know where the pee come out. 
 Okay, Cattie, if you know so much, where does the pee come out? 
 My mama said it's indecent to... 
 I just have to sit down to do it... that's all I know. 
 My point exactly. 
 Well, it don't matter because when I find out the student who wrote this filth, there's gonna be hell to pay. 
 What if a teacher wrote it? 
 Well, then, I'll fire that pervert. 
 It don't matter, 'cause as of now, "Detergent Dawn" is banned. 
 It's "The Turgid Dawn." 
 We're banning books now?! I hate it here! 
 You know, I-I may be just an old, washed-up mop jockey, but, uh, tell you what I would do. 
 Would that be, Geoffrey, minding your own business?

 Yeah, I-I made a mistake, Warden... Ma'am... Warden.

 Fairbell, come with me. 
 I have a health-education matter to discuss. 
 We're gonna see Doctor... 
 How are you gonna get yourself out of this one, Brock? 
 What makes you think that I wrote this? 
 Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's something like, "She had a waist like a Campbell's Soup can and cans like a souped-up Neve Campbell." 
 How long you been sitting on that? 
 [Sighs] Since "Scream 2." 
 You got to help me, Shoemaker. You heard her. 
 If she finds out I wrote this, she'll fire my ass. 
 This is garbage. 
 You're on your own, "Broman Polanski." 
 This is not garbage... it's literature.

 Dr. Greene, what is the status of the "handemic"? 
 Well, not gonna lie to you... this is the worst outbreak of carpal tunnel I've seen since Tim Wakefield picked up the knuckleball. 
 It's that "Turgid Dawn"... that thing reads like a [bleep] user's manual. 
 We need something foolproof, y'all, like... like abstinence education. 
 Well, I've never seen a problem that can't be fixed with a well-timed skit. 
 That's a great idea... an abstinence skit. 
 Everybody loves skits. 
 Ooh, you could get that thespian, Summer, to help you.

 Uh, bottled water, Hydrox cookie? 
 No. Gross. 
 Why did you call me here, Shoemaker? 
 [Scoffs] 
 I may have been a bit premature in my assessment of your novel. 
 Well, that's funny 'cause I remember you saying that you hated it. 
 What?! 
 Yeah. 
 No. No, I'm just... 
 I'm just hypercritical of things that I love. 
 I mean, ask my son. 
 That's true. 
 And-and maybe... 
 Poor b*st*rd. 
 I think it's a little immature that you believe that breasts are always producing milk, but who am I to judge, huh? 
 Okay, I'm not an idiot. 
 I know that they need a break every now and then, but how was Jade supposed to feed Brock when they were trapped together in that submarine? 
 And that's why you're the author and I'm just a simple businessman. 
 See, I believe you have really tapped into the Zeitgeist with this thing.

 Yes. But all that dream...

 That's where I come in. 
 You need me as an anonymous author to represent you. 
 I never thought of it that way. 
 No, and that's... 
 I mean, I guess I'm kind of... stuck between a "Brock" and a hard place, aren't I? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Chuckling] Right? 
 That's the name of the novel. That's the sequel. 
 Write that down. I want you to write that down. 
 No, no. The good ones I always remember... always. 
 All right. I'll let you take your chances. 
 Which is why I just drafted up this little thing. 
 I don't... I don't know if we need a contract, Shoemaker. 
 Oh, oh, oh, contract? 
 [Chuckling] No, no, no, no, no, please. 
 No, don't think of it as a contract. 
 Think of this as a... as an informal agreement between friends that just happens to be legally binding, huh?

 Nothing, just the old Abbey that I know... she would have never tolerated a book banning. 
 She would have printed out a thousand copies of that thing just to shove them in my little face, but this is... this is better, you know? 
 Time passes. People change. 
 They get older. They get wiser.

 Quinn told me to come in here, but did I just see Cattie drive across the lawn? 
 Sounds about right. Quinn's back in charge now. 
 And that's why you're gonna have to live in my house with me to have a positive male role model! 
 He sounds angry. 
 Oh, it's all for show. He's in there, tickling Loren. 
 [Laughs] 
 Right there. 
 That's it, right there. 
 Why don't you go on home? 
 I'll get you off the hook. 
 Thank you.
