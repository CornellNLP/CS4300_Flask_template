 ♪ Do-do-do ♪ 
 Hey. You wanted to see me, boss? 
 Yes. Yes, I did, Coach Fairbell. 
 Please, uh, have a seat. 
 We have to have a pretty serious discussion here. 
 You can sit in the... the chair. 
 The chair? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 [Breathes sharply] 
 Pretty good, right? 
 What I have to tell you is actually pretty grim. 
 "Grimm"? [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 That's my favorite show. 
 Okay, no, no, no, no. 
 What I'm saying... Let me ask you this... if you had all the time in the world, what would you even do with it? 
 Easy... just spend more time with my girls' JV volleyball team. 
 Extra practice means... boop... extra perfect. 
 Let... let's say that it was, uh, not here at Smoot. 
 Let's say it was time away from school. 
 Then what would you do? 
 I'd just wait across the street for school to open, like I do every day. 
 [Whispering] My God. 
 Okay, well, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, all right? 
 I had to do next year's budget, and we got to make some cuts. 
 That's why you're in charge, Big Dog. 
 What's got to go? English? Math? 
 Nobody's gonna miss those. 
 Cafeteria? I mean, I'll miss it but... 
 Coach Fairbell, it's you. 
 I'm hinting at the fact that it is you that I have to cut, okay? 
 You.  All right? 
 Before you say something heartbreakingly simple, let me just clarify... you are being laid off at the end of this week.

 And then Tampa has to love you again, because money fixes everything.

 Oho! 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 How are we? 
 Hey, Shoemaker. 
 How was your lengthy commute this morning? 
 Well, I'm not quite sure what you're referring to. 
 Sure, you're not. 
 I was just telling everyone that real-estate mogul and newly elected mayor Gil Nash is gonna be Smoot's graduation speaker. 
 Here? He's speaking here? 
 I'm so proud. 
 Now, now, now... 
 I can't believe that you're letting that right-wing lunatic speak. 
 Hey, that's a Libertarian lunatic, please. 
 He has done a ton of damage to women's health issues. 
 His stupid period taxes cost me $148 this month. 
 Abbey, I keep telling you... if you want a maternity leave, you have to pay for it somehow. 
 Fine. I'm not taking this lying down. 
 Quinn, I am going to stage the biggest protest that you have ever seen. 
 Enough! 
 Do you need to go back down to your library? 
 Fine. 
 Fine. 
 I think it's terrific that you're gonna be speaking at our graduation ceremony. 
 And, as this year's Joslyn's graduation rep, I would love nothing more than to see you do it in a professor's tunic. 
 Now, please, I... 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 No, thank you. No, thank you. 
 We don't have any extra cash for any cheap swag, so... 
 Wouldn't be a good salesman if I didn't try. 
 I'll see you at the same time tomorrow. 
 You know, Leslie Bronn, I woke up this morning thinking, "There's a woman who likes to sleep in a oversized T-shirt and..." 
 I sleep in the nude. Beat it. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Are you, uh, buying a condominium?

 This was my Bible when I lived in Spain. 
 No, no. You lived there. Yes!

 Oh, hey. Wow. 
 Yeah, sorry. I-I'm glad I found you. 
 I heard there was, like, actually a pop-up brewery on the campus. 
 Apparently, they have, like, some awesome beers. 
 Yeah, they... they did. 
 Oh.

 Oh, man. 
 I swear to God. 
 I hate it when men [bleep] on me. 
 Ugh, yeah. 
 100%. 
 Well, I mean, this being Denver, there's, like, a couple breweries around, you know? 
 So, we can maybe grab a pint or... five? 
 Absolutely. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm buying.

 You look like the kind of lady that likes to sleep in an oversized T-shirt, and, lucky for you, Joslyn's happens to have a dynamite one. 
 Let me go ahead and show you. 
 Shoemaker, I'm kind of busy. 
 I'm getting signatures to stop Gil Nash from coming to Smoot. 
 If you're busy, what better way to organize those filled days with the Joslyn's "Class of 2017 Hunks of Smoot" calendar? 
 I'm not interested in buying anything from someone who is currently sleeping in the janitor's closet. 
 Well, that is not... [Laughs] 
 I am not residing in the school. 
 That's cra... Y-y-you're way out of line. 
 Yeah, everybody knows, Shoemaker.

 Hi, guys. 
 This is my favorite history teacher. 
 Okay. 
 My favorite librarian. 
 Oh, how are we... 
 Okay. 
 ... this beautiful morning, huh, guys? 
 God. 
 Are you drunk? 
 You broke your slump. 
 I did. 
 Ha! Yeah.

 How do you know that? 
 Oh, a guy can always tell. 
 Plus, he's still full bat. 
 Oh, God! 
 Excuse me. Oh, God. 
 I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so excited, you know? 
 Jade is incredible. I-I honestly think she's the one. 
 [Both laughing] 
 But I'm serious. She's smart... 
 What? 
 Oh, you're serious. 
 ... independent. She's really funny. 
 Plus, she taught me it's not cool to refer to women as [bleep]. 
 Mm. 
 Yeah. 
 I think I might be woke. 
 Speaking of woke, it looks like Fairbell just rolled out of bed. 
 I guess he's not taking getting fired very well. 
 Looking good in that sleeping shirt, Coach. 
 I'm glad I could put you in it. [Chuckles] 
 Oh, you mean "Soon-to-be-Former Coach."

 Huh. 
 Hi... 
 I am Fairbell. 
 This is the best date I've ever had in my entire life. 
 I cannot believe I finally met a girl who's down to watch all seven "Fast and Furious" films, consecutively. 
 I mean, are you kidding? I thought it was so sweet that you cried when Paul Walker took that left, and you were just bawling. 
 I mean, you're just so in touch with your emotions. 
 I mean, that's 'cause of you. 
 I'm not afraid to be myself around you. 
 And, I was wondering if you'd be my girlf... my woman friend. 
 Will you accept this Joslyn's premium brand key chain as a token of my love?

 Come in and, uh, shut the door, please. 
 Look, if this is about the Gil Nash protest, I think you need to stop right there because... 
 Look, you're not Loren's best friend. 
 So, I'm just gonna come out and say it... you probably haven't even noticed that he has a bit more pep in his step. 
 Yeah. Everyone has noticed. 
 They were [bleep] each other in the faculty parking lot. 
 Don't you mean that he was [bleep] her? 
 No. 
 Wow. 
 That explains the extra $75 charge. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I... ordered Loren... a lady of the night. 
 Uh, Jade is a prostitute? 
 Yes. She's a prostitute. 
 [Laughing] Oh, my God. 
 It's not funny, okay? 
 I did it to help Loren break his streak. 
 [Laughing] It's funny. 
 It's  not  funny, 'cause now they're dating, and she has my credit-card number. 
 Abbey, $300 for a lookout mountain BJer. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, why don't you just stop paying her? 
 I can't, because then Loren's gonna find out the truth, okay? 
 And that is where you come in. 
 I will allow you to protest Gil Nash's speech if you can help me break up Jade and Loren, organically. 
 I do think it's hilarious that Loren is dating a prostitute, but this is my opportunity to save a woman from s*x work.

 Oh, yeah, she has. 
 Yeah. 
 Other day, she had three fingers inside of me before I... 
 Oh, I know. We all saw it in the parking lot. 
 Um. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Ever since you, uh, broke your streak, you seem, um, different. 
 I really like it. 
 Yeah, it's 'cause I'm woke now.

 Whatever... whatever it is, it's, uh...

 Okay.

 Oops. [Laughs] 
 Yeah, you can keep the pen. 
 I got, like, so many more of those. 
 Why don't you break up with Jade, and you and I can, like, have some fun together? 
 First of all, I'm flattered, you know? 
 But, second of all, you are so gross.

 No, no, no, there's not. There's just the one way. 
 Yeah, the guy lies flat on his back, and then she's in heels and squats. 
 Oh, geez. 
 Well, my hunger strike may have been ignored, but now I'll use my body's pure muscle as an immovable object to keep you from getting access to my office.

 Yes? 
 Yes, I would love to be Mrs. Loren Payton. 
 Really? 
 Yes, yes! 
 [Laughs] Oh. Oh.

 [Chuckles] 
 She kissed me on the mouth. 
 I did. 
 Guys, she kissed me on my mouth. 
 Yeah! 
 Yes! 
 I've never seen a whore do that. 
 Oh, hey, look at that. 
 Your, uh, cold sore's coming in nicely, there. 
 It's chapped lips, dude. It's unrelated. 
 No, it is not. That is an aggressive herpe from that new fiancée of yours. 
 Fiancée? I like the sound of that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 How'd you get her to quit her job? 
 Oh, no, I didn't. No, between our two salaries, she's the breadwinner in the family. 
 Oh. 
 Literally, she's working the Orowheats conference downtown this weekend. 
 Oh, wow. Loren, I think that you might finally have gotten woke. 
 If my fiancé was getting whack-a-moled by eight guys in a hotel room, I don't think that I could handle it. 
 I couldn't. 
 I guess I never thought of it that way. 
 Yeah. 
 Or at all, really, but I'm cool with it. 
 Yeah. I'm cool... I'm cool with... 
 Well, you should be, 'cause Jade is awesome. 
 Yes. 
 She gave me her business card, said that if I ever wanted to change careers, give her a call, huh? 
 Yeah. You'll stay busy because there are plenty of sickos with ginger fetishes in this world. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, you guys are too sweet. 
 Yeah. I had a pretty kickass night myself. 
 Tampa found out about my economic windfall, and she said, "I want you to come home." 
 Hey. 
 Oh! 
 Yeah. I'm renting the basement... for $2,500 a month. 
 Wait, $2,500? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that is steep for a none-bedroom, but I'm 15 feet away from being part of my family again, so... 
 Ohh! I just had the coolest thing happen to me. 
 The mayor just called me. 
 No way. 
 Yes, huh. Yes, huh. And guess what... 
 He just made me the new principal. 
 What? 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. Since Quinn got arrested again, it's me! 
 I'm the principal! 
 Yeah, he said he'd never seen passion like mine before, and anyone who's willing to "self-imitate" in front of everyone is exactly the kind of stable principal that Smoot deserves. 
 No way. In what world are you my boss? 
 This one, right now. 
 Shut up. 
 Fairbell, principal. Wow. 
 Abbey, you ought to protest Gil Nash over this bull[bleep] 
 I'm done protesting. If Fairbell really is principal, then I'm gonna spend some time on Abbey. 
 Besides, how bad can a real-estate mogul turned politician be? [Chuckles] 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 Giving the job to that flaming volleyball coach was genius. 
 Ha! 
 I was gonna put lead in the drinking fountain but this will ruin the school so much quicker. 
 Yep. And after Captain Deep[bleep] runs Smoot into the ground... 
 You get your corner unit... 
 Ah ah. 
 ... and I get my mixed use condo. 
 [both laugh ominously]
