 Here you go, gorgeous. 
 Thank you, Louis. 
 You know, you've really been spoiling me these last couple of days. 
 Well, I was gonna spoil you a little bit more in the morning,    but you were gone when I woke up. 
 Ah well, you know, it's the last day. 
 I had to get this good spot on the beach. 
 Look, um... this doesn't have to end.

 Hey, have you had a chance to talk to Joanne    about when I might be back in the field? 
 No. 
 She has been so stressed and negative lately,    it's like, "OK, Noanne." (CHUCKLES) 
 You know, I just started my new position,     and I don't feel comfortable rocking the boat right now.

 According to my sandy-ass pussy: No, bitch. 
 I'm just focused on getting this money     so I can get up outta there. 
 And, you know, it's been two weeks already. 
 You should've just stayed with me. 
 Nah, girl.

 Let me tell you right now. 
 This whole vacation     put everything in perspective for me.

 - I'm listening. 
 Okay, so vacation bae was trying to kick it with me in L.A.,     and I had to put him in his lane. 
 "Bloop! 
 You beach dick."     Quentin was trying to do some long-distance sh1t,     and I said, "Blip! 
 Stay in Chicago."     And my new job was trying to front on my benefits,     and I said, "Blam! 
 You better give a bitch a PPO."     So you bloopin' and blippin' and blappin'? 
 And blammin', bitch. 
 I'm on some "know better, do better" sh1t.

 - Mm-hmm. 
 I feel like my whole life is on some tip-toe sh1t right now. 
 Like, I can't speak up about anything. 
 You know you can always talk to me, right?

 - Uh-huh. 
 So hey, you gonna     "know better, do better" with your boyfriend Dro?

 Bloop! 
 See? 
 You don't even do it right. 
 So you just gonna act like you didn't break my vase?

Out of all the places that you could've stayed,     you stayed with me. Yeah, I did, but... - not for this. - But isn't it always this? You were just low-key dropping hints about me f*cking somebody else. I don't care who you f*ck. I just want a heads-up so I don't have to be here. Why are you here? 'Cause I needed a place to stay. And you're close to work. (LAUGHS) I thought I was staying here as a friend,     and you know we always at least had that. Yeah. These... glasses are so heavy. I'm tired. Is it... daylight savings time? Did that happen already? (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (MOLLY PANTING) Yeah... Yeah... Oh, I missed you.

All right, I'll call you back. - I can make pancakes. - (SIGHS) Listen, um,     we need to decide     whether we're friends who  don't  have s*x,     or acquaintances who  just  have s*x. Because anything otherwise, it's muddy,     and I need boundaries. OK. All right. What do you suggest we do, then? We f*ck. And that's it. No phone calls, no dates, no spending the night,     no f*ckin', then trying to make pancakes. - But we love pancakes. - Nigga. Well... OK. Yeah. That's fine. Oh, you mean like now. OK. I'm so sorry to hear that,     Vice Principal Irving. Can I ask why? VP IRVING:  We've decided to link up with a different organization that we feel better suits our students. And you know your logo's racist, right? Y'all need to do better. I'm sorry. Thank you for your feedback. Hi, my name is Issa,     and I'm calling from We Got Y'All. Uhm. I'd love to find out     why you're not partnering with us anymore. MAN:  The brochure features black kids, but only one black employee. That is... me. WOMAN:  The curriculum feels very Eurocentric, and it isn't at all catered to our demographics. WOMAN  :  Everyone you brought to our school was white. -  And mean. - OK. Thank you. ISSA:  And I'm not trying to rock the boat, but I thought this was something that you'd want to know. And where did you get this information? I was hearing a lot of criticism during our follow-up calls,     and since our list of canceled partnerships seemed pretty high,     I thought it might be helpful to call those schools. No, Issa, it's not helpful. If I wanted you to speak on our behalf,     I would have left you out in the field. You keep overstepping your bounds. I'm sorry, I thought that... Have you noticed that every time there's an issue here lately,     you're involved? If you want to be helpful,     get to the root of that. That's all.
