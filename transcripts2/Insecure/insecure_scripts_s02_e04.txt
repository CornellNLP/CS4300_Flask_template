  What? 
  Since when? 
  A year ago. 
  I'm serious, I'm serious. 
  Traditional marriage, that sh1t just didn't work for us. 
  You got married in a church. 
  I didn't expect things to go this way either. 
  (SCOFFS) 
 
 
 
  Look, look, it's a lot of pressure. 
  To be all things to one person? 
  - Come on. 
  - Well, then make friends! 
  You just can't be out here cheating But it isn't cheating. 
  We're very honest with each other. 
  Isn't that how relationships work? 
  - I mean, I guess. 
  - Yeah. 
  It's not like we out in these streets, hoing around. 
  But if something happens, yo, it happens. 
  (SIGHS)

  I know! 
  - Mm. 
  - (ISSA EXHALES) 
  Well, as long as they're both being honest. 
  He said they are. 
  I mean, I guess it's better than doing sh1t behind your person's back Lying, cheating, moving out. 
  You talking about you. 
  I'm not talking about anybody specifically. 
  You talking about you specifically. 
  Damn, is anyone married like my parents anymore?

  Tiffany said that Derek lived in a hotel last year. 
  Could I f*ck Derek? 
  Would I f*ck Derek? 
  Should I f*ck Derek? 
  So, are you considering this? 
  No! 
  Girl, it's Dro. 
  Like, we grew up together and, yes, we kissed in middle school, but, like, that's it. 
  And if it was ever gonna happen, it would not be like this. 
  Yeah, but if he were some guy on the street Like Derek. 
  - would you consider it then? 
  - But he's not just a guy. 
  He's married, so that's not even on the table. 
  Well, now he wants to f*ck you on this table.
