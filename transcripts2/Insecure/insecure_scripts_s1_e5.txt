 [music stops] Wow. I know. It's so stupid. Yeah, but, like, funny stupid. Wait, was... was this the night that we...? I had had a few drinks and, uh, I just needed to blow off some steam. Well, look, yo, yo, I know you used to rap in high school, but it's weird seeing you like this. It was a mistake, okay? I never thought this would see the light of day. It's not that bad. Not that bad, Lawrence? Middle school kids have seen me rapping about pussy smells. For the rest of their lives, they're gonna associate pussy smells with me! Well, you did find a way to rhyme "loosey" with "poosie." You're basically teaching them Shakespeare. [chuckles] Lawrence, this is embarrassing, okay? I need the kids to take me seriously  and this completely undermines that. They're kids, all right? Look, they'll have fun with it for a couple of hours and then forget about it after the weekend. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Broken pussy! [laughing] [music playing] [music continues] Hey, Miss Issa! Look what I made. Uh, I am so sorry. I didn't even know this was out there. Issa, I know this is rough and... Girl : And maybe... Kids : It's had enough! Shh! Shh. Believe me, I am mortified. Okay? I will fix this. Thank you. Because Julio is starting to teach it in Spanish. [speaks Spanish] Spanish, though? [phone chiming, buzzing] Mm. Oh, it's Monday already? I know. The weekend went by way too fast. [moans] [growls] Flavor Flav, off! [whimpers] [sighs] [both laugh] Damn dog. You know, I gotta go home anyway. I can't go to work in jeans. Well, next time, you'll just have to bring an extra suit. Yeah, I should carry a garment bag around with me on dates. Or you could just leave one here. Uh-huh. So, what are you up to tonight? Uh, that all depends. Are we gonna finish what we started? Actually, my friend Diane's having a party. Okay, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, she just got engaged, so she's celebrating that. Wanna come? Uh, can we play it by ear? I got a lot going on at work. Yeah, of course... of course, yeah. It should be pretty nice, though. It's gonna be at Hatchet Hall. Okay. I'll try my best. All right. I should probably let Diane know if I'm bringing a plus one. Okay, put me on the list. Okay. See you tonight. All right. ♪ See me in me heels an' ting ♪ 
♪ Then check so we hip an' ting... ♪ [bell rings] [shouting, cheering] One, two... What are you gonna do? Where are you gonna go? Everybody's laughing at you, a female Bozo. You can go and hide or you could try to fix it. Go get all your tools together. Get on your mechanic. [engine starts] Damn! Issa :  Right? And now the kids at school are talking about it. And if it gets back to my boss, who the f*ck knows what she's gonna do? And, girl, I got memed. What? Yeah. I just don't have time for this right now. Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait. Just slow down. How did the kids find it in the first place? Daniel! He was talking about what a great rapper I was and... and the kids must've googled me, the stupid, smart-as-fuck, researching-ass kids. Mm. Uh-uh, don't give me the auntie "mm," okay? I'm the victim here. Oh, you're the victim? This video was recorded without my knowledge or my consent. It's basically rap rape. Okay, well, technically, it was my pussy, so if anybody's gonna blow the rap rape whistle, it would be me. Look, I just need you to be my lawyer and threaten the sh1t out of the person who posted this video. Are they refusing to take it down? I don't know who posted it! Then who I'ma threaten, Issa? All right, who else was there that night? Mm. Daniel might know who posted it, okay? He knew hella people who were there that night. All right, so there's no other person who was there who could help? Not the bartender, not the emcee or any other nigga you haven't carried a f*ck torch for? Bitch, I don't... I don't care about him! Okay? I just wanna get this video taken down before it ends up on WorldStar. All right, well, let me see how I can help. I'll call Jared. His brother performed at Maverick's that night. Thank you, seriously. [sighs] [paperclips rattling] Oh, you gotta work? Yes, bitch, I'm a real-ass lawyer. Okay. So? Nah. Damn it! I checked with the manager and the DJ. Nada. What am I gonna do? Listen, let me just make some calls, okay? No, it's fine. It's not on you. It is, though. sh1t, I should've never told the kids you rapped. Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out. I'ma find out who put that sh1t up and ghost it. I gotta be at the studio in 20. Can you drop me off? Hey. I got you. [music playing] Yes. So, he's fat? Yes, he's fat. Very. Whatever. Not big-boned, fat. Yes, sir. You're stupid. Damn. Roscoe's got some talent. Hey, I'm getting married, man. Shut the f*ck up, man. No, for real this time. Leah's it, brah. Wow. Yo, how long y'all known each other? Not that long. It's crazy, though, man. The one day, I'm getting the girl a deal on a loft, next, I'm getting engaged, moving into that loft, and realizing it has some real structural problems. sh1t. Yo, congratulations, man. Thanks, man. Yeah. Brah, she's got me doing crazy sh1t. She want me to meet the parents. I drove her to the airport. Why you laughing? Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy. Yo, how'd she make the cut? She's special. You know, man, when you know, you know. Plus the head is crazy. What about you and the old girl? Oh, we good. For real? Last time I talked to you, you told me you didn't give a f*ck about her. No, I told you I f*cked up her birthday. That's kind of the same thing, though. Seriously, man. I mean, we went through some sh1t, but... we in a good place. So, what's taking you so long? I'm still getting my sh1t together. Yeah? Nigga, why don't you get your sh1t together-together? That's what I told Leah. We're gonna handle her divorce and our prenup at the same time. It's just good time management. What? What's up with your hair, though? We need to get this sh1t fixed. I got a guy. I'm not f*cking going. It's a little off on the corner, man. The corner's off. My hair is fine. It's right there, man. [phone buzzing] Yep, right there. Hey. Hey! It's been a minute. How you doing? Just busy working. Just... Mm-hmm. So, what's up? You remember Issa? Well, someone shot a video of her rapping that night at Maverick's, and now she might get in trouble for it. But I remember your brother performed that night, so maybe he might know who posted it. Yeah, maybe. I'll ask him. Thank you. [scoffs] That's what friends are for. [chuckles] So, was that all you called me for or...? It was, but it's really good to hear your voice. You should hear it in person. Is that Chris? Chris? Oh. [mouths words] f*ck. He sounds friendly. Yeah, he, um... yeah, no, it's, um... I mean, it's not, you know... [stammering] Relax, yo. I'm just f*cking with you. I know! And I'm f*cking back, yeah. Ha. [chuckles] I'll talk to my brother. All right. Have a good one. Bye. Bye. [sighs] I am so sorry. Who was that? It was Jared. And can you stop playing Who's Molly on the Phone With? 'Cause you're pretty bad at it. Yeah, I suck at guessing. Idiot. Daniel : Yeah, that's what he told me. No, man, I'm just... are you sure? All right. Thanks anyway. Come on, guys. f*ck! This is what the f*ck I get. For what? Why'd I have to go up on that stage? This... this is why I don't do sh1t. This isn't me. Are you kidding? That's all you. All right? You gotta go for sh1t like that, and you were good. Yeah? Yeah. You feel better? No. Why don't you come in for a second? You don't need to be driving all stressed out, all right? Just come in, wait out the traffic. Yeah, okay. Yeah? All right. [music playing] [horn honks] [music continues] Yo. Yo, y'all, this is Issa. Hey. What up? Issa : Hey. Yo, we good, man. Hey, you want something to drink? Oh, I'm good. Thank you. All right. You want the wheel with chairs on it? Uh, so... no, I'll... I'll just sit right here. That's what's up. Thank you. Are you ready to do this? Yeah, let's get it. Let's do it, boo.

You think I'm so pathetic that I needed you to come and save me? You're the one who was asking me to come. Like, repeatedly. But I did not ask you to lie. We barely even know each other and you're talking about me leaving clothes at your spot, making plans six months in advance. I thought this was what you wanted. You should leave. Now.

I mean, yeah, you know, we were long distance and sh1t, but you never took me serious. We were friends with benefits! Because you wanted to go do your thing out in the streets. [chuckles] Yeah, okay, so it's on you. How is it on me? Now you're trying to make me feel a way on purpose, huh? You... you're really gonna act like you don't know? Okay, do you remember the summer when I came home from college? Mm, when you were hella obsessed with Danity Kane? Liked, nigga. I liked Danity Kane. Yeah. Anyway, you were the first person I wanted to see. And then remember we spent the whole day together? Mm, right. We had tacos from three different trucks. Yes, because you couldn't remember which spot had that sauce you liked, and then it ended up being basic-ass Jack in the Box. Jack in the Box goes hard for breakfast stuff. And then when I was driving home, you called me back over and... I thought you were gonna say you wanted to, I don't know, make things official. You know, give us a shot. But you didn't. I should have. I wanted to. I mean, maybe you're right. Maybe... maybe I wasn't ready then. Well, you should've said something. I know. I know. What if I'm ready now? [scoffs] I... I... Hmm. sh1t.
