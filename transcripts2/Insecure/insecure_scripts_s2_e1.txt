 I'm... glad we're finally getting the chance to talk.   
 You know, I get why you did what you did now.   
 And it hurts, but...    
 Hopefully, we can move past it.    
 What?    
 I said, are you originally from here?    
 Oh, yeah. I grew up in Windsor Hills, but I live in Inglewood now.    
 - You live near here? 
- Yep, born and raised.    
 - So, where you from? 
- Honestly, it doesn't matter what I say    
 - 'cause this isn't going anywhere. 
- Oh, yeah?    
 I used to work in Inglewood. 
I'm in Cerritos now.    
 [both chuckling]    
 High school kids? That sounds tough.    
 - You like working with kids? 
- So, how is it working with kids?    
 To be honest, f*ck them!    
 But I'm trash, too, so... you know?    
 So, how long have you been on Hinge?    
 - Mmm... 
- How long you been on Bumble?    
 - [sighs] 
- How are you still single?    
 I'm a liar, sweetie. 
I cheat on niggas, too.    
 I do! Probably shouldn't trust me or I'll hurt your feelings, boo.    
 I don't wanna be here, but my ex won't take me back, so my broken ass is here, small talkin' over apps.    
 Put it down, girl.    
 I'm so dead inside, nigga, I cry every day.    
 You should get the check and here's the tip... Check...    
 [echoes] run away!    
 Are you okay?    
 Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm great.    
 All right. Do you need another...

 Yeah, you know, I've been working late a lot, but otherwise, everything's fine.    
 You know, I feel like    
 I'm exactly where I should be in my career.    
 Oh, that's great.    
 So, how are things with your family? You mentioned that your brothers tend to be a little bit all over the place.    
 No, I think we're fine.    
 We're good. [chuckles]    
 We haven't talked much about your life outside of work.    
 Is there anything there you'd like to discuss?    
 No, not really.    
 Well, whenever you're ready to open up, just let me know, or we could switch seats and I could tell you my issues.    
 [both chuckling]    
 Thanks, I... I really appreciate that.    
 She's trying to get all deep, trying to get all in my business.    
 Girl, that's what they supposed to do.    
 I mean, we just started working together, but I at least like that she's black.    
 - She sounds better than the other one. 
- True.    
 I definitely spent an entire session trying to explain what "being woke" was to Dr. Rosenberg.    
 And then I said "nigga" in front of Dr. Connors and he wanted to use the rest of the time    
 - trying to "unpack that." 
- Mm-mm.    
 I'm just trying to be really open-minded and give this whole therapy sh1t a shot.    
 Well, the only way you're gonna know is if you stick it out.    
 sh1t, if I had insurance, I wouldn't...    
 Girl, Grey sweatpants eyeing you at  :  ,  :  ,  :  .    
 Girl, I don't know. He on the move! Just look!    
 What? Oh, him?    
 Okay, I see you with the superhuman nigga repellent.    
 - You focused! 
- I know, right? It's been a minute.    
 One day I looked over, my dick meter was all the way on E.    
 Join the club, bitch. Dick on E.    
 Bank account on E.    
 Life on E.    
 Stop. I'm fine.    
 Nope. Malibu, bitch. Be honest.    
 I am! I'm way better than I was a couple months ago.    
 I'm just tired of this dating sh1t, girl.    
 It's so much f*cking work.    
 All the messages I gotta send.    
 I gotta be cute and careful and witty and charming.    
 It's a lot.    
 I mean, not if you just trying to f*ck.    
 - And I compare every dude to Lawrence. 
- Well, that's expected.    
 [sighs] He probably still hates me.    
 - But it's fine... 
- Girl, he does not hate you.    
 I mean, he still responds to your text messages, right?    
 It's all bills and apartment sh1t, though.    
 Girl, he won't even come pick up his mail because he doesn't wanna see me.    
 You know what? I just want us to be cool.    
 I don't even want him back.    
 It's okay if you do.     
 But real talk, though? 
Guys always want you back when they know you're doing good without them.     
 Look at you, unpacking my sh1t.

 - You hate it? 
- No. I love it.     
 It's just funny.     
 Mm.     
 Yo, should I start calling you "Zommy"?     
 - That don't even go. 
- [chuckles]     
 - No, you leaving? 
- Yeah.     
 Yeah, I mean, I've been in your space all weekend.     
 - I gotta go. 
- Okay.     
 Hey, you wanna get together Thursday?     
 Uh, nah, Thursday's no good, but I could do Friday after work.     
 Mmm.     
 Okay.     
 Maybe I'll be here.     
 You'll be here.     
 Mm!     
 Bye.     
 Ninny, what's the meaning of this?   
 - A book? 
- Oh, listen.   
 I just don't know what you mean, Ms. Massa.   
 - Ninny, so help me... 
- [gasps]   
 ... if this is anything more than a cookbook,   
 there will be consequences!   
 The footless kind.   
 Oh, bitch! Let the bitch read!

 My bad!     
 I saw some spots today.     
 - You find something? 
- Nah, not yet.     
 But give me a few weeks, though. I'll be out.     
 Yeah, you gonna move back in with ol' girl?     
 [whirring stops]   
 Relax, man. I'm f*cking with you.     
 What, you going to sleep already?     
 Yeah, I'm tired, man.     
 All that f*cking, huh? I didn't know you had it in you, bro.     
 - Good for you. 
- What you mean?     
 Man, you got your new sh1t down to a science.     
 You roll in on Friday, smash all weekend, bounce out on Sunday. 
It's low maintenance, efficient,     
 - all upside. 
- It's not even like that. She's cool.     
 You don't even take the bitch out. 
You know how much

- Cloth napkins and sh1t.     
 Yo, you don't know what you're talkin' about.     
 All right? We're both having fun.

 [kids speaking Spanish]   
 Okay.     
 Hey, everyone, in case you forgot, we will be in the library from  :   to  :  .     
 Yeah, and we have everything you need.     
 We have calculators, we have iPads, Smart boards.     
 - We can get those, right? 
- No.

- Frieda: Line up and...     
 - Guys, we have everything you need!

 No? Okay, next time. 
I'm Frieda. Nice to meet you.     
 No? Okay.

- Oh, okay.     
 - Next time. 
- Hi, Ms. Alvarez.     
 - Uh, yes, I was just leaving. 
- Okay, I won't be long.     
 We'd just really love your help in convincing some of your students to stay.     
 Do we need to tailor our curriculum to be more culturally specific?     
 Culturally... I'm an art teacher and they have me teaching geometry.     
 So I have to go review chapter  .     
 And   through  .     
 Oh, that's a lot.     
 Hey, so we have zero students, and our teacher still only speaks Spanish.     
 Yeah, we asked her to learn English and she didn't.     
 This school is a disaster.     
 [sighs]     
 Diane: If I didn't have to go to Jamal's work thing, you know I would totally do this call myself.     
 I asked Kevin and Tim, but they took the day off.     
 - Lumineers concert. 
- [scoffs, chuckles]     
 No problem.     
 Oh, are you bringing a gift to Hannah's goodbye thing?     
 I can pick her up something nice and put both our names on it.     
 - Yeah? 
- You're the best.     
 I was thinking maybe, like, experience gift or something.     
 Yeah, I don't know.     
 Automated voice:  You are now being connected.   
 There are six other callers on the line.   
 Hi, this is Molly Carter with Merrill, Johnson & Schwartz.     
 Woman on phone:  Oh, hi, Molly. Diane brought you up to speed?   
 She sure did.     
 Great. Welcome. We've got Eric Blackwell   
 -  and Anthony from research... 
- [mouthing words]     
 ... and conference Saunders on the line.   
 We're hoping to keep this brief.   
 Our main objective on this call   
 is to cross-reference our strategies on Sycamore   
 and to make sure we're all on the same page.   
 Sorry, I thought you were on the phone.     
 -  The major output... 
- Oh!     
 ... the split in authority on class   
 action waivers and arbitration clauses. We also   
 wanna make sure we're effectively managing client expectations.   
 Um, it seems like we already know what our client wants.     
 We just need to determine what jurisdiction this matter falls under.     
 Agreed.   
 But we also should continue to explore   
 whether or not there's a settlement to be reached here.   
 It's... it's possible that talking to this arbitrator   
 puts us in a weaker position than using evidence.   
 We have to persuade...

And I was thinking about doing one of those Wine Downs like how we used to do.     
 Back when we used to watch "I Love New York" and drink Moscato?     
 Yep! But how do you feel about making it a plus-one party?     
 Hey, we can have everybody roll through, bring a single friend, and then just, boom, unions everywhere.

 Hello?     
 Okay.     
 We're seeing double the attendance this year at Audubon Middle.     
 Engagement is extremely high, and we've also been teaching them how to write resumés.     
 Um, I think they're a little young for resumés.     
 - But extra credit over here is just... 
- Okay, this is great.     
 Issa, where are we with East   st Street?     
 Kitty's reports say you have no interest and no attendance?     
 Mm, yet.     
 But we are working on making the faculty aware of how we can help alleviate their struggles.     
 Oh, they're aware; they're just not receptive.     
 We just haven't connected with them yet.     
 Uh, yeah.     
 They just have so much going on at East   st Street.     
 If only we had a Latino staff who could connect with them.     
 - Issa:  Oh, okay, I think... 
- [whispers] I thought she was Mexican.     
 I told you. Mm-mm.     
 No, I've heard her speak Spanish, I think.     
 ... but despite all the difficulties...     
 I know you guys are working hard, but I don't know if this is gonna pan out.     
 Issa, Frieda, let's talk new options tomorrow.     
 Sarah and Kitty, I'm moving you guys to Peary Middle.     
 - Yes! 
- Joanne: Thanks.     
 - Where's that? 
- A good place.     
 [phone buzzes]   
 Joanne!     
 Joanne?     
 I don't think we should give up yet.     
 I love that you wanna try this school, but we have run into this problem before.     
 High schools are tough, middle schoolers just show up.     
 - Older kids push back. 
- I get that, but isn't it our job to make things work even when it's difficult?     
 All right, but if I don't start to see some progress soon, we are moving on.     
 Okay. No, great. Thank you.

 But how do you deal with the Chicago winters?     
 Really big jackets.     
 Plus, I never go outside.     
 Do you think the cold has anything to do with how violent it is out there?     
 Because I get it.

 Since the partners are drunk tonight,     
 I'm, uh, thinking about putting a buzz in their ear for a raise.     
 Oh, okay. Right.     
 You've been buzzing already?     
 About a raise?     
 What, so they can expect even more out of me?     
 f*ck, no!     
 You guys, are my cheeks red? 
Are my ears red?

 Everyone, can I have your attention, please?     
 Hannah: Thank you. I... I really, really appreciate this.     
 It's... it's really too much!     
 Now, everyone who has worked with Hannah knows that she is truly, truly a force.     
 Am I right? I mean, really just...

- Yeah, a force that they forced out.     
 Stop it! God.     
 - Excuse me. 
- Why is everybody pretending the Chicago office is not a step down?     
 - What are you talking about? 
- She couldn't handle the pressure.     
 - The partners could tell. 
- Uh, I doubt that.     
 She was always working later than anybody.     
 If anything, she's leaving because she didn't feel valued.     
 Well, then she should've said something.     
 - Closed mouth, no food.

 I took off work so I could walk down the street, and do sh1t to white people finally.     
 Real talk, don't tell nobody 'cause I'm gonna go to full jail.     
 - I'm not surprised. 
- Like, full ja...     
 - Like, you ever see "Lock Up Abroad?" 
- Mm.     
 They gonna lock a broad up.     
 What's going on?     
 Lawrence isn't coming.     
 Why would he have been coming?     
 Because I may have told him to come get his mail.     
 At this exact time.     
 [scoffs]     
 Wow. Okay.     
 So you threw a party, Lawrence was supposed to come over to said party, and if he would've showed up, what was your plan?     
 You said that a nigga always comes back when he thinks that you're good, and look, I'm good.     
 But that's in Malibu. And I thought you said you didn't want him back.     
 Bitch, of course I want my man back. What the f*ck? I was lying.     
 The whole point of saying Malibu is to not lie.     
 Well, at the time, I thought I was not lying.     
 - Malibu. You stupid. 
- Malibu. Shut the f*ck up.     
 [door opens]   
 Whoo! Bad news, ladies.     
 I drank all the Rossi.     
 [laughing]     
 Oh!     
 Can they come party with us?     
 Man: Y'all having a party?     
 Sure, why not?     
 Oh, I'm gonna put you to bed.     
 You ever been burped?     
 - Burped? 
- [Kelli laughing]     
 [music playing]   
 [chatter]     
 You live here, right?     
 Yeah.     
 - Do you have any herb? 
- Yeah, I've got a prescription.     
 - [gasps] 
- Looks like we got "bompany."     
 - What up, y'all? This a party? 
- Oh, hey, Thug... uh, Miles.     
 No, we're just keeping it low-key.     
 Yeah, for sure. What's up with your friend?     
 - Is that you? 
- No, you know I'm not gay.     
 Hey. Hey, you "bute" and you thick.     
 - What's your name? 
- Kelli, but I don't talk to grown men     
 - who wear limited colors and bang. 
- I don't bang, sweetheart.     
 I'm a lover, not a fighter.     
 Well, what if I like both?     
 Mmm.     
 [both mouthing]     
 Hey, whose speaker is this? I'm about to "bonnect" it.     
 - I got a playlist. 
- Yeah, yeah, that's mine.     
 My phone's already connected, so...     
 -  [music playing] 
- What the f*ck?     
 Oh, sh1t!     
 Thug Yoda: Hey! Okay.     
 Yeah!     
 Hey. Yeah. Hey, look at my nigga footwork.     
 - Kelli: Oh, my God! 
- Thug Yoda: f*ck that!     
 Did he choreograph that? Is this choreography?     
 Thug Yoda: Hey, hey!     
 Yeah, nigga!     
 - Oh, my God. 
- Turn the music off.     
 Yo, Issa, this sh1t is getting kind of out of hand.     
 [knocks] Hey!     
 Can y'all turn this down? Some of us got kids.     
 Bitch, I got kids, too! Turn up!     
 - Oh, sh1t. 
- Oh, sh1t! Fire! Fire, fire!     
 - Oh, sh1t! 
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!     
 Women and children! Women and children!     
 - Let me get your number. 
- Nigga, no!     
 - sh1t! 
- Jesus!     
 [people screaming]   
 Molly: Oh, my God.     
 - [panting] Oh, my God. 
- Tiffany: Don't touch my braid!     
 Jesus Christ.   
 [sighs, mouths word]     
 [chatter]   
 You know what?     
 If I weren't already here, I would come here.     
 - Do they know we're in this room? 
- Yep. Now we just wait.     
 Okay.     
 - Um, hey. 
- Hi.     
 What do you guys do?     
 We give you all the tools you need to succeed.     
 - Where are you having trouble? 
- Uh, do you guys tutor geometry?     
 - Our teachers don't know it. 
- Oh, absolutely!     
 We have great tutors. I, myself, am an expert in English and Latin.     
 - Not that you need it. 
- I see, I see.     
 Well, I think I have one of those learning disabilities, so...     
 Oh, that's great. Oh, I mean, not great, but great because we have...     
 - Both: Do you guys have pamphlets? 
- Oh, yes, we have a bunch!     
 Here, tell all your friends.     
 And in the meantime, we can just sit here and...     
 - Thank you! Hurry, hurry, hurry! 
- I'll get the Oreos.     
 Hold on. Seri... come on, y'all! Really?     
 - Are y'all serious? 
- _     
 [kids cheering]     
 Did that really just happen?     
 Yep.     
 But, hey, at least they came. 
Now we just need to get them to stay.     
 The food was supposed to make them stay.     
 True.     
 We just have to try a different approach.     
 Next time, I will stand by the food and you can lock the door,     
 - and then... 
- Frieda.
