  As much as I love that visual, I just Ugh, I don't know, like, I just I'm embarrassed.

  Like, I was just trying to show him he was special to me and then he just made me feel stupid. 
  No, girl, you not stupid, okay? 
  He was being disrespectful.

  So, y'all are having an affair? 
  Girl, no.

  Yeah, better for Dro and Candice. 
  But what about you? 
  - Like, where is this going? 
  - I don't know. 
  That's the point. 
  I guess. 
  Hold up, okay? 
  I didn't judge you for hoing around these last few months. 
  Oh, that was different, okay, 'cause I knew what I was getting myself into. 
  Bitch, you just got a surprise facial. 
  - What the f*ck you talking about? 
  - Really? 
  Malibu, I'm just trying to look out. 
  And I appreciate that. 
  Malibu, why don't you do you, and I'ma do me?

  You ain't worth nothin' - Unh - You - You - Unh I should've seen it comin' - Unh - You You You said I was the only one You [CLEARS THROAT.] 
  You know, the good thing about the PSAT is it's multiple choice. 
  You could close your eyes and fill out anything and still have a good shot. 
  Don't do that, though. 
  You'll fail. 
  You know, We Got Y'all offers PSAT tutoring. 
  You should come through. 
  I tried to, but Mr. 
  Gaines told me and my friends the program is full. 
  [BOTH LAUGHING.] 
  - Hey, y'all. 
  What's up? 
  - ALL: Hey! 
  Corn maze was epic. 
  You guys missed out. 
  Ah, yeah. 
  Gotta blame my allergies, man. 
  - What'd you end up doing? 
  - Just, uh, kicked it at the house.

  - Oh, sh1t. 
  - [CHUCKLES.] 
  - Okay. 
  Mm! 
  - Yeah, I told you. 
  That's right. 
  Look, I'll get you a tub of it once you get that big raise.

  - Hmm. 
  So, when is your white boy meeting?

  Well, look, I'ma be in LA in a few weeks.

  Or maybe I want you to take me out. 
  You know, just show me around. 
  M'kay. 
  - [CHATTER.] 
  - Hey. 
  So, earlier? 
  It's cool. 
  You know, I guess I, uh I just didn't want people in our business like that. 
  Do we have business? 
  It's just I've made mistakes jumping into something too fast before. 
  And I don't wanna do that with you. 
  I get it. 
  We still on for drinks at that new bar tomorrow? 
  Shh, can you keep it down? 
  Somebody will hear you.

  - You got jokes. 
  - Hey. 
  - Oh, hey. 
  Can we talk? 
  I mean, I'm pretty busy with some computer stuff. 
  Well, I just wanted to show you this. 
  They're some ideas I had to increase Latino enrollment at East 41st Street, to show them we're available to them. 
  Oh. 
  Okay. 
  What? 
  I had the same thought. 
  It was part of this whole initiative, but - this is great. 
  - Thanks. 
  God, even when we're fighting, we are still synced, - mentally, physically. 
  - That's too much. 
  No, you're right, and I didn't mean it that way. 
  Can I ask where this is this coming from? 
  Uh honestly, I was in a weird place for a minute, you know, and kind of got away from myself and lost in the heat of it all. 
  And you were right and I'm sorry. 
  I get it. 
  And I'm sorry about earlier. 
  I was being a real bitch. 
  "Oh, hey. 
  " Like, what was that? 
  - Thanks. 
  - Yeah. 
  Want these back? 
  No, you can hold on to those. 
  - Okay. 
  How was Chicago?

  Oh, Candice is coming.

  - You okay?

  [PHONE BUZZES.] 
  [CAMERA CLICKS.] 
  [PHONE BUZZES.]

  MOLLY: And earlier this year, I signed another Fortune 100 telecommunications company. 
  This one client has the potential to generate upwards of $2 million alone in its first year. 
  Wait, wasn't Hannah on Marist? 
  She was. 
  That's one of the files I inherited when she left. 
  So, whether it's covering for Hannah's transfer or just a fellow associate who has other plans, I am always happy to step up. 
  I think we all agree you're a huge asset to the firm. 
  Thank you. 
  However, it is unusual to start negotiations so far ahead of your annual review. 
  Right, but given when Grayson and McKinney were promoted to partner, this firm has demonstrated that it is not bound to timing when it comes to recognizing hard work. 
  We hear you. 
  We really do. 
  And when your review comes around next year, all of this will be very useful. 
  We'll have space. 
  Will you have one? 
  Okay, great. 
  Hi. 
  Tell your parents. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Mr. 
  Gaines, do you have a second? 
  Yeah, make it quick. 
  Pot pie gave half the ninth grade food poisoning. 
  There goes my mop budget. 
  Sure. 
  I realize I've been negligent in how I presented myself. 
  Negligent? 
  What do you mean? 
  Well, We Got Y'all is inclusive of everyone, and I might have made it seem like that wasn't important to me, but Is your program full? 
  Are you helping the youth? 
  - Yeah, but - Then what's the problem? 
  Look, I thought me and you had an understanding. 
  Now you're coming at me on some All Lives Matter? 
  - It's not - I'm sorry. 
  We were just hoping for a more representative group of kids. 
  Look, if you want Mexicans, nobody's stopping you. 
  You're turning away Latino students. 
  They deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else. 
  These are kids. 
  [LAUGHING.] 
  Girl, calm down. 
  Ain't nobody dead. 
  Okay, go, man. 
  - Oh, hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Yo, I know we said we were gonna grab drinks at 7:00, - but would 10:00 work? 
  - What's up? 
  I forgot I gotta stop by this thing. 
  Oh, a thing. 
  Is this at a place? 
  It's a birthday party. 
  I'm just gonna swing through. 
  My ex is supposed to be there. 
  Oh. 
  Yeah. 
  Maybe we could try another night. 
  Or I can go with you if that's easier. 
  Uh sure. 
  Mm, my bad. 
  [PHONE BUZZING.] 
  What do you want? 
  I was hoping we could talk. 
  And I just wanted to apologize so we can move past this. 
  Apologize? 
  That was f*cked up. 
  You're f*cked up. 
  I just got caught up in the moment. 
  You embarrassed me. 
  And it's me. 
  Like, why would you even do that? 
  You right. 
  Like, it was f*cked up. 
  It was f*cked up. 
  Can you forgive me? 
  Please? 
  Iiiissss, pleeeease? 
  Shut up. 
  I hate you. 
  Why our sh1t always gotta be so messy? 
  You got me. 
  But, I mean, I guess we're even now. 
  Even? 
  Yeah, it's like, you know, we both did some f*ck sh1t, you know? 
  Wait, what? 
  So you're You're saying you were trying to get back at me? 
  - What? 
  No. 
  What? 
  - Wait, wait, wait. 
  So, you did this on purpose, like on some fucked-up revenge sh1t? 
  Listen, it's not even that deep, all right? 
  I'm just sayin', like, now you Now you know how I felt. 
  You disrespectful, petty-ass nigga. 
  - Hey, hold on, you just - You know what?

  It's a women's jacket, but you can't tell. 
  Okay, so Derek doesn't know this, but I got him a box of high-end Cuban cigars. 
  They're rolled by this entire family, even the children. 
  I know it sounds sketchy, but what can I say? 
  I love my man. 
  Vince? 
  Actually, it's Vance, like "dance. 
  " - [SNICKERS.] 
  - VANCE: Signature cocktail? 
  You can choose from the Tiffany, which is a sparkling rosÃ© with muddled raspberries and a hint of vermouth, or the Derek, which is our take on the amaretto sour. 
  - What's your take? 
  - He added an extra cherry. 
  - I'm gonna go check on the app situation. 
  - Okay. 
  Mm! 
  I thought Sweetie was just gonna be some strange, but I'm going with his parents to mosque next week.

  Can we all just scoot down just a little bit? 
  Oh, no, that's fine. 
  It's okay.

  Nope, still Derek's.

  " [POLITE LAUGHTER.] 
  Oh ahem! 
  Can I get a whiskey? 
  Oh, so we drinkin' now? 
  I didn't like neither one of their cocktails, so I mixed them together. 
  I call it a Derffanny. 
  It's like them f*ckin' in a glass. 
  Mm-mm. 
  Half joint, whole joint 'Nother joint [CHATTER.] 
  I thought what Abramovic did was really moving. 
  She's just sitting there staring at you, and it's art?

  Nothing fancy, but we have our eye on a couple foreclosures. 
  Fingers crossed the owners lose it. 
  I love her. 
  Iss, didn't your building change owners? 
  I mean, getting upgraded and sh1t. 
  It barely looks like a trap house anymore. 
  - [LAUGHTER.] 
  - Yep. 
  When I picked Issa up, I saw they had a Pinkberry on Manchester now. 
  What'd that used to be? 
  I used to go there all the time when it was a - Popeyes.

  Hey. 
  Look, I wanna explain, all right? 
  I wouldn't have brought Aparna if I knew - You're so full of sh1t. 
  - What? 
  You couldn't wait to parade whoever-the-fuck in front of me and my friends? 
  I'm not parading anybody. 
  And then on some f*ck sh1t, you block me? 
  Wow. 
  Okay, yeah, I blocked you because I was tired of seeing pictures of the nigga you f*cked while we were together. 
  I didn't post pictures! 
  Nigga, I don't give a f*ck who posted the pictures. 
  - You still f*ckin' that nigga? 
  - Why do you even care? 
  Of course, so you're still f*cking him. 
  Who else did you f*ck while we were together? 
  Are you serious right now? 
  I don't know what the f*ck you was out here doing, apparently.

  He's got way more going on than Woot Woot. 
  Speaking of, what's up with that? 
  'Cause I ain't get no Woot Woots on my phone.
