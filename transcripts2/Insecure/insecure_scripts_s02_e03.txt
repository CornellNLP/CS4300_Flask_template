  That party was on, though. 
  Absolutely. 
  You know, that sounds great, Hannah. 
  And discovery's complete on Sycamore, and I e-mailed Merrill about the summary judgment motion, but he hasn't responded. 
  Well, we all know how that goes. 
  Just hang in there. 
  I have to hop on another call. 
  - Quentin, can you fill Molly in? 
  - Absolutely. 
  Molly, I will see you when you're here next week. 
  And, look, I gotta go soon, too. 
  The sun is actually shining today and I'm going to the beach. 
  Okay, don't call it a beach. 
  You know it's not the beach. 
  See, you can get disbarred here for saying something like that. 
  Well, out here, you can get promoted for being an asshole, so. 
  [laughs.] 
  Well, you better not let them hear you. 
  [both laughing.] 
  [kids chattering.] 
  [bell rings.] 
  Boy: Aw, man. 
  You stupid, fool! 
  You see this? 
  I'm so glad to hear you say that. 
  I've been thinking a lot about how we can balance the classroom's demographics. 
  Wait, what? 
  Demographics? 
  We're finally getting consistent numbers. 
  Yeah, but the numbers are all they're black. 
  Is this the Gotcha thing? 
  Yes, it is! 
  Welcome. 
  If you need a place to study or you need tutoring Mr. 
  Gaines sent us. 
  He said you had extra space. 
  Yes, we do. 
  But do you have any friends or, like, amigos, amigas? 
  Okay, listen, why don't you find a seat and we'll be by in a few to see how we can help. 
  All right. 
  So, Mr. 
  Gaines is is Trying to look out for us? 
  Yeah! 
  Yeah, he is! 
  And at least now we have students we can actually help. 
  It's not that I'm not happy that we have more kids, but the school's 86% Latino and the attendance doesn't reflect that. 
  Frieda, we have to start somewhere, all right? 
  I don't know why you're trying so hard to turn our success into failure, but just take the W! 
  Hey, you guys good? 
  Yeah. 
  What are you studying? 
  What do you need? 
  [crunching.] 
  [crunching continues.] 
  Colin, enough with the chips. 
  They're not chips, they're Chirps. 
  - Made from crickets. 
  - Aparna: I don't care. 
  You know, I actually tried crickets once in Phuket. 
  - They're high in protein. 
  - You know what else it's high in? 
  f*cking crickets. 
  - [Aparna snickers.] 
  - Whatever. 
  I gotta go take a tinkle. 
  Is that what he said after you two? 
  Shut up! 
  - Did you - Hook up with a dude who eats bugs? 
  Yes, she did. 
  It was Startup Saturday, so f*ck you. 
  I don't know what that is, but that is not a good enough excuse. 
  It's some mixer thing. 
  Trust me, it's depressing. 
  All the guys are disgusting or lame as sh1t. 
  It's true. 
  You'd freaking clean up. 
  Uh, yeah, I don't know about that. 
  Actually, there is another one this Saturday. 
  - You should come. 
  - Yeah, I'd love to, but I promised someone that I would pick up some chairs. 
  It's for a family barbecue. 
  This just keeps getting sadder. 
  Next time, though! 
  Yo, I'm there. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Whatever. 
  Just use the note cards, Mom. 
  You don't have to memorize the vows. 
  He's already married to you. 
  You can wear your glasses. 
  Dad knows you wear glasses. 
  Mom, I have to go. 
  Mm-hmm, I love you.

  - Thanks, man. 
  Okay, baby. 
  And - All right. 
  - You wanna drive? 
  Issa: But, wait, you're putting therapy on pause till when? 
  Till I find another therapist. 
  I mean, Dr. 
  Rhonda was always putting her sh1t on me. 
  [scoffs.] 
  Just because we both got brown titties. 
  [chuckles.] 
  Okay, wait. 
  What? 
  "Put shelf 25 in 7C"? 
  - I don't know - Hey, girl, you know what? 
  You do this part and I will do this part.

  'Cause there's plenty of brown titties in the sea. 
  Oh, you got jokes? 
  [laughs.] 
  Okay. 
  Because there's plenty of brown dicks in the sea, too. 
  But you ain't got one. 
  [gasps.] 
  Okay, first of all, trying to f*ck is hard. 
  No, it's not. 
  It's like riding a bike. 
  Yeah, I don't know how to do that either. 
  Like, I kept on thinking, "What if he's not good? 
  Or what if I'm not good?" And I don't know, I'm just stuck in my own head. 
  Well, what you think therapy is? 
  I'm stuck in my head talking to a stranger. 
  At least you get the option to f*ck at the end. 
  Yeah, but you chose not to be out here. 
  But it's not like I don't want somebody. 
  Then, girl, get yours. 
  I should. 
  We should. 
  I mean, we were supposed to do this ho sh1t together.

  But I just don't know what it is! 
  It's, like, on paper, he's amazing, but I don't know.

  - It's like with Dro and Candice. 
  I just ran into them at the cupcake shop. 
  Ooh, which two did you get? 
  Bitch, who cares? 
  Chocolate and caramel? 
  Yes, but the point is, like, Dro didn't have no five-year plan. 
  Hell, he didn't even have a five-day plan. 
  Yeah, Dro was a mess. 
  Right? 
  But he just went with the flow and he found the perfect person. 
  With Lionel [groans.] 
  I feel like he was just checking off his boxes. 
  Get into a relationship, check.
