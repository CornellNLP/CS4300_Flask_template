  How about hopping in on Saddle? 
  Brooke and Colin still need a biz Dev guy.

  Okay. 
  So, how's Saddle going?

  I was just saying I hate missing previews. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  But at least we got seats.

  What? 
  No, he's not. 
  It's my sister. 
  My niece put a plate of syrup on her head and she called it a hat. 
  It's cute. 
  Why are you bringing up Colin again? 
  Y'all seem to be real buddy-buddy lately. 
  I just was curious. 
  But there's nothing to be curious about. 
  Cool. 
  [SCOFFS.] 
  Doesn't sound like it's cool. 
  Well, just be honest. 
  I don't wanna be out here looking stupid. 
  You're making yourself look stupid.

  How? 
  'Cause she started taking her pulse? 
  I mean, she did get a Fitbit.

  - I was like, "Bitch, why?"  
  - [CHUCKLES.] 
  - We are wack friends. 
  - Tsk. 
  Where's she supposed to be?

  [MOCK LAUGHING.] 
  That's how I laugh. 
  Quentin's coming to L. A. 
  in two weeks. 
  Ooh, you should take him to Earle's Grill. 
  Nah, girl, they closed. 
  Nah, girl, they opened back up with the Metro line. 
  Oh, maybe we should go there, 'cause I'm trying to keep it real casual. 
  - Oh, really? 
  - Yes, really. 
  I like him, but he's not my type. 
  Pic, please. 
  MOLLY: Ugh! 
  Oh, he got a beard. 
  - That's what's up. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Sorry. 
  We're late. 
  There's a good reason why. 
  - [PHONE BUZZES.] 
  - Oh, we just got a text from Kelli. 
  "Meet me at the finish line"? 
  Damn, already? 
  That bitch got Kenyan in her? 
  I see you accepted a structured settlement on your last case. 
  Yes, I always put my client's interest first. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  What would you do if your client didn't want the annuity and wanted a lump sum settlement? 
  You know, I actually had that exact scenario happen when I was a second-year associate. 
  I present both options to my clients when necessary, but I determine my recommendation based on the settlement amount. 
  It's all about helping the client make an educated decision. 
  Honestly, Molly, you know, you were great on paper, but now that we've met you, we're impressed. 
  - [CHUCKLES.] 
  - And I love that you're an L. A. native. 
  - Florence and Crenshaw. 
  - My dad grew up there. 
  Is the McDonald's still on the corner? 
  - Sure is. 
  - [ALL LAUGHING.] 
  - QUENTIN: So, Hayward made the offer? 
  - I got it three days ago. 
  So, what I'm gonna do is just go on a couple more interviews, take a few more offers Yeah, and bring it to the partners, right? 
  - Okay. 
  Okay, Molly, I see you. 
  - [CHUCKLES.] 
  Now let them know you can go anyplace you want to. 
  Exactly, and hopefully, they'll wake up and bring something to the table. 
  That's right, how it goes is up to them. 
  Yeah, what it's really up to is that paper. 
  That's real, you know? 
  Just cut the check. 
  - Merrill, cut the check. 
  - [BOTH CHUCKLING.] 
  And, uh, can you count them zeros? 
  Future Molly trying to f*ck up some commas! 
  - Oh, hey! 
  - I'm sorry, did you want the check? 
  Wait, what? 
  Nah, nah, we don't. 
  We good. 
  We ain't ordered yet. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I mean - Hey, you good? 
  - Yeah. 
  I I saw a guy I used to know. 
  I mean, look, of course guys out here check you out. 
  You're the most beautiful woman in here. 
  Tsk, okay, Quentin. 
  No, I'm serious. 
  And, like, thanks for taking me out, you know? 
  And when you're in Chicago next week, um, you know, take one of those nights off and we'll do dinner. 
  I guess. 
  I gotta eat. 
  [CHUCKLES.] 
  I'm always down to eat, homie. 
  DR. 
  PINE: Well, "homie" is not a great place to start. 
  Why do you just see him as a friend? 
  He just doesn't seem like the guy I should be with. 
  Ugh, "should. 
  " I know. 
  I heard it. 
  Well, maybe it's time to focus on what you could have instead. 
  Get out of the should and live in the could. 
  I promise I've never said that before. 
  - [BOTH CHUCKLING.] 
  - But we're just gonna go with it. 
  I could get with it. 
  I'm glad you're back, Molly. 
  So let's schedule your next appointment. 
  Oh Yeah. 
  We missed our chance for the 12th, but if we file by tomorrow, we can still meet the deadline to oppose the motion for summary judgment. 
  - You know what? 
  - Hmm? 
  We deserve some incentive. 
  What? 
  Oh, where were you when I didn't wanna study for the LSATs? 
  Yes! 
  Hey, you can take us out the 'hood [BOTH CHUCKLING.] 
  - All right, here we go. 
  - All right.

  Ah, we deserve this. 
  To working hard and getting it done. 
  - [CHUCKLING.] 
  - Bam! 
  - Ah, yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  So, is everybody in the Carter family as successful as you? 
  Well, my younger brother is 26 and still doesn't have a driver's license. 
  My older brother's married to a stripper. 
  - What about you? 
  - [CHUCKLES.] 
  My sister sells flat tummy tea on Instagram. 
  - Hmm. 
  - I mean, she got hella followers, - but what's her endgame? 
  - Wait, what's her name? 
  I might follow her. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  You know, this might be the best time I've had working late in this office. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLES.] 
  Should I assume you didn't mean it like that? 
  Or should I assume you know exactly how you said it You know exactly how you meant it? 
  Should I assume it's a mean, sweet disposition Switching position, f*ckin' submission Should I assume it's a weekend thing, boy? 
  You could get ass all week Droppin' that ass, just think about me, think about me And it's all good, what's the difference if it's all good? 
  Split the difference if it's still good What's the difference if it's still good? 
  Just not yours exclusively Used to be all good, trade it all now I think I'm just gonna let it play out and see what this could be. 
  - You never know. 
  - ISSA: From what you said, it sounds like you know the dick was meh. 
  Okay, wait, I never said that. 
  I like him. 
  And, plus, he's been hella supportive throughout this whole job interview thing. 
  And he makes me laugh, which, right now, is kind of nice. 
  Okay. 
  So, have you decided what you're gonna do about work? 
  You gonna stay with the whites or go with the blacks? 
  I don't know. 
  I mean, at least at MJ&S I know what I'm getting. 
  Plus, I put in a lot of time there already. 
  But then at Hayward, I feel like they get me. 
  But then again, how much can you really tell from one interview? 
  I just wanna go with whoever values me the most. 
  Blacks all "zay. 
  " - [MOLLY CHUCKLES.] 
  - Hold up, Ida B. 
  Wells. 
  You know when you work with black folks, they get too comfortable. 
  They wanna compare potato salad. 
  They get all up in your business, trying to add you on Facebook, inviting you to church! 
  It's like, "Damn, Therese! 
  Quit trying to baptize me at work. "  
  - Wow. 
  - Damn, maybe working with whites is right. 
  On the other hand, when you working with white folks, you gotta make them feel comfortable about you. 
  Explaining your outfits, speaking on behalf of all black people, trying not to be a stereotype. 
  It's like, "Okay, Meg," I'm eating watermelon. 
  So what, bitch? 
  "It's hot. 
  " - [PHONE BUZZING.] 
  - So, I'm just f*cked. 
  - Apparently. 
  - Ugh, it's Tiff. 
  She can't make it. 
  - I'll call her. 
  - Boo! 
  You know what, you could be a lawyer anywhere. 
  - Follow the money. 
  - That's what Quentin said. 
  - [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV.] 
  - Oh, sh1t, Kelli, it's starting! 
  KELLI: Mm, here we go. 
  "Due North"! 
  For starters, we know that you've been meeting with other firms. 
  The legal community in L. 
  A. 
  is very small. 
  MERRILL: Bottom line, Molly, we wanna make sure that you know we hear you and value you. 
  And, uh, we don't wanna lose you. 
  Well, thank you. 
  That means a lot to hear you say that. 
  Which is why we are giving you the Rising Star Award! 
  - [MERRILL CHUCKLES.] 
  - SCHWARTZ: It acknowledges new talent poised to go very far in the legal field. 
  JOHNSON: Your photo will be prominently featured on the firm's website. 
  MOLLY: For real? 
  - You play too much. 
  - [PHONE BUZZING.]

  - [ISSA SCOFFS.] 
  - Kelli! 
  - Hey, guys. 
  - What happened? 
  I'm so sorry. 
  I I got my period. 
  - No! 
  - That makes one of us. 
  - Gross. 
  - But why didn't you just put in a tampon and keep moving? 
  Well, it got me before I could get it. 
  I mean, I got to mile nine and the Red Wedding hit. 
  Just killed my drawers. 
  Just dead. 
  Then I got bussed to the finish line over an hour ago. 
  [SNORTING.] 
  No, I'm sorry. 
  That's oh, no, yeah. 
  Well, honey, at least your Ivy Park is on point. 
  I know, right? 
  But I didn't finish my sh1t! 
  I mean, y'all know I've been training for months. 
  - BOTH: Yeah, we knew that. 
  - Oh, my gosh. 
  Well, look how far you got. 
  I mean, you ran nine miles. 
  - None of us can run that. 
  - I mean, it's basically just a 10K. 
  Honey, can we let Auntie Kelli have this for our little angel? 
  Aw, Baby DuBois! 
  Wait, you knew Tiffany was pregnant? 
  Yeah, sorry. 
  We're closer. 
  Sorry. 
  I mean, y'all can plan the baby shower with my suggestions. 
  We stopped trying, but then we were so high at Issa's party Whoo-hoo, that's our little weed baby in there. 
  [KELLI LAUGHING.] 
  - Y'all cute! 
  Y'all cute. 
  - Yeah! 
  KELLI: I can't believe you're having a baby. 
  Ugh, good things happening to good people. 
  TIFFANY: We're all doing great things. 
  Look at you getting fit. 
  Look at Kelli. 
  Look at Molly taking interviews, taking names. 
  Look at Issa. 
  - Mmm. 
  - KELLI: Look at No, you told me before. 
  - Yeah, no, she - KELLI: Yeah. 
 
 
 
  Almost there. 
  Tip of the tongue. 
  - Drop it. 
  [IMITATES BOMB DROPPING.] 
  - Issa. 
  - KELLI: Ah! 
  [CHUCKLES.] 
  - TIFFANY: Issa - I'm, uh, moving. 
  - sh1t. 
  Yeah. 
  JOANNE: I am so moved. 
  The mountain came to Muhammed. 
  Are we the mountain? 
  Isn't that the question? 
  FRIEDA: Wite-Out? 
  Wite-Out? 
  Ah, para tu, para tu, aqui. 
  What got you guys thinking about using the space on weekends? 
  We just, uh, wanted to service the students that weren't being serviced during the week. 
  What do you mean? 
  Why weren't kids being serviced? 
  Oh, just the program got really popular. 
  Well, we could've had Kitty and Sarah back in if it was a space issue. 
  Uh, it was more than that. 
  The vice principal was just being really resistant. 
  How so? 
  I didn't see any of this in the reports. 
  Let me get Frieda over here. 
  Oh, no, no, no. 
  We don't need to involve her. 
  This is entirely on me. 
  The VP wasn't interested in servicing Latino students. 
  We I thought we could remedy that by having extra sessions here. 
  Wait, wait, wait. 
  Are are you telling me that you're having segregated We Got Y'all sessions here? 
  Do you know what this could this could be a lawsuit. 
  - I didn't think about that. 
  - This is incredibly disappointing. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  After we make some calls to remedy this, we need to reevaluate having you out in the field. 
  KELLI: Why are you just standing there?! 
  - Run! 
  - Isaac done killed Christine 'cause she was having relations with Ms. Lydia. 
  - Damn! 
  - What the f*ck? 
  When Ninny told me the poison didn't work, I did what I had to do! 
  - [GRUNTING.] 
  - Get off! 
  I hate slavery! 
  - You sick, lying - [BOTH ARGUING.] 
  I thought that simple slave was really simple. 
  And I told you that fool was shifty. 
  You see, you mind your business, you get free. 
  - [MOLLY SCOFFS.] 
  - [PHONES BUZZING.] 
  Pssh. 
  It's Tiffany's pregnant ass trying to get all in the mix. 
  She just got pregnant and she's already being boring and dramatic. 
  [MOCKING.] 
  "I'm Tiffany. 
  I'm pregnant. 
  " [SCOFFS.] 
  Calm down. 
  You know she gonna eat the placenta? 
  That bitch gonna live forever. 
  Mmm. 
  So, now that "Due North" is over, y'all wanna help me pack? 
  For what? 
  You ain't got nowhere to go. 
  - I still gotta leave! 
  - We'll help you. 
  - Come on, girl. 
  - Pssh. 
  Thank you. 
  You can help me wrap up my valuables. 
  Girl, stop playing and tell us what you really want us to do. 
  - [CHUCKLES.] 
  - BOTH: "Valuables. 
  " Just wrap my sh1t up, please. 
  Have you contacted my friend, Kaliah, about being your roommate? 
  Nah, not yet. 
  Honestly, I wanna live by myself. 
  Bitch, where?! 
  You ain't got no money! 
  I didn't mean to come at you like that, but a bitch try a bitch. 
  Okay, Issa, Kelli's got a point. 
  KELLI: You can't live anywhere but way the f*ck out. 
  I'm talking Lancaster, West Covina. 
  I can afford to live alone, you know, if I take a second job or something. 
  Well, maybe you can sell some of your stuff. 
  I guess I could get rid of some things. 
  Just everything. 
  It is with great pleasure that I introduce you to our new director of student outreach. 
  Frieda. 
  Hey, wait, she got promoted? 
  Yes, I need to feel confident about who I have in charge. 
  Frieda has spearheaded several initiatives here.

  Pictures on the wall Remind me of all The old sh1t that we were Pictures on the wall Remind me of all The sh1t that we lost It ain't right But that's life Little did we know when we were young We were dumb, we were too young We were young We didn't know that everything would come falling down We didn't know that everything would come crashing down Hey. 
  What happened? 
  I kind of lost control one night. 
  You waited for me? 
  Yeah. 
  I, uh I didn't like the way we ended things. 
  Me neither. 
  And I don't know, I just feel [SIGHS.] 
  like I'm f*cking everything up right now. 
  Well, you've come to the right place. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE.] 
  This spot looks so much bigger than it felt. 
  I know. 
  It's gonna make some young white couple really happy someday. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLING.] 
  - Yo, when did the pool get so nice? 
  - I know, right? 
  Raising the rent and sh1t.

  I mean, one reason, yeah. 
  Look, I'm sorry. 
  Oh, my God, please don't apologize. 
  Just give me a second. 
  Let me finish, please. 
  I've been thinking about how sometimes I set these expectations for myself, and I just I shut down if they don't go how I I just, uh I'm sorry for not being who you expected me to be. 
  Who I expected me to be. 
  Lawrence, I wanted to be better for you. 
  Because of you. 
  But somewhere along the way, I depended on you to be better for both of us. 
  And when you were going through what you were going through, I just didn't know how to handle it. 
  I mean, what could you have done, though? 
  More. 
  You know, that's when you needed me to be better for the both of us, and I didn't even know how to do that for myself. 
  Well, that makes two of us. 
  And, you know, - what I did - We don't have to go through that. 
  it was the worst thing I could've ever done to you. 
  And I wish I could somehow convince you that it wasn't about you. 
  You've only ever loved me and expected me to want the best for you, and I promise I did. 
  I still do. 
  [SNIFFLES.] 
  Lawrence, I still love you so much. 
  I love you, too.
