  I just think that it's funny that she calls me "Old Molly" when she's out there, right now, doing old sh1t too.

  So this is the first time where he's been like, "Oh, okay. 
  I need to contribute in some way that makes me uncomfortable". 
  And so I think mainly that's been being vulnerable, and opening up, and like, you know, just being an Asian man, and being raised the way he was, talking about things that don't make him feel strong or make him feel insecure, are really difficult for him. 
  What do you think, sort of, is going through Molly's head, uh, during her argument with Victor, about her overreacting to the towel lady? 
  [Sighs] 
  It's... 
  I think it's the first time that Molly's had to defend her existence to somebody who is of Andrew's side of the relationship. 
  So it's like the first time that Molly's had to explain what being black is like to Victor. 
  And Andrew is kind of on the side, but also at the same time, is... 
  is just trying to understand where both sides are coming from. 
  And I think in that moment, what he was trying to do, by trying to diffuse the situation, wasn't actually helpful because he actually made Molly feel more isolated. 
  This is our first episode out of the country. 
  What was it like? 
  I think it was... 
  it infused, I think, a new energy into the show to also take a show that on-paper is about, you know, these two black women that live in a very specific part of L.A., and take them and put them... 
  and to see why people travel. 
  Yeah. 
  And to take the show and not just show, you know, obviously, us filming there, it's one thing to see black people, you know, in front of the camera, behind the camera. 
  Out of the country, you know, filming a television show. 
  But I think, also, it does a lot even on screen to see that, 'cause we do travel. 
  No Issa. 
  I mean how was that for you on your side? 
  It was a blessing. 
  I've been waiting for this moment for four seasons. 
  Alexander: She said let's get three more. 
  And it was... 
  Yes, let's get three. 
  Next season, woo. 
  I'm not gonna be in none of it. 
  Not gonna be in none of it. 
  But I do want to talk about just the presence that Issa has on this trip. 
  Um... 
  [Chuckles] 
  So I think, even though Issa was not appearing in this episode, Issa definitely featured heavily. 
  I feel like it's affected Molly so much because Issa and Molly are just such a strong presence in each other's lives. 
  I do wonder if the fight with Issa hadn't happened, and if she didn't have that burden on her trip, if she would have gone so hard on Victor. 
  Victor was being a bit of a dick. 
  Mm-hmm, Victor was a dick for sure. 
  Yeah. 
  I think Victor was the victim of displacement of her anger. 
  And I think that's what's interesting about episode six and seven. 
  Even though they're not in each other's episodes, their presence is felt. 
  That's how strong these two women are in each other's lives. 
  And how much, by them not dealing with it, it's still a presence they have to face in some way. 
  And so I think that's what's great about the end when Yvonne is like, "I have to sort of start to deal with this". 
  When do you feel like it's right to react... 
  or to let it go? 
  Speaking as myself, or what I would like myself to do? 
  Speaking as yourself. 
  React. 
  React all day? 
  So the towel... 
  From the towel lady to the fight in the jacuzzi. 
  Yeah. 
  Those are your moves. 
  Well I need to... 
  I need to work on it. 
  I'm actively working on this myself. 
  Doctor Rhonda is available. 
  It is... 
  Look, I have my own Doctor Rhonda, and she helps me... 
  I... 
  I react a lot. 
  I feel like reacting might not be the issue. 
  Overreacting is an issue. 
  Reacting is not an issue. 
  But I think when you react, it's important to like find a way to maintain capacity to listen. 
  Okay, well we can't thank you enough for joining us this week. 
  Be sure to join us next week for a new episode of the Wine Down. 
  Cheers. 
  Cheers.
