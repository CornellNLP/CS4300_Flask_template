 I found a long, blonde hair on Simon's scarf. 
 You followed me? What did you think I was doing? 
 I'm pretty sure my husband is sleeping with someone else. 
 I'd be nothing without her. She's... a wonderful mother, a talented doctor and not a bad little earner! 
 ( Gemma gasps ) 
 So in sympathy and admiration, please be upstanding for a toast to Gemma. 
 All : To Gemma! 
 'Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned... Nor hell have a fury like the woman scorned.' 
 There you are! Erm, we ought to cut the cake, really. 
 I thought you'd want to be there. 
 Of course. 
 Excuse us. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well. 
 You've only been here half an hour. 
 No, I'm not drunk. I just... 
 I feel sick. I could be sick. I should go home. 
 Man : Come on, you two! 
 Yeah, yeah! 
 Come on! 
 Do you want to go now? 
 I'm really suffering. 
 Is it serious? 
 No, I'm sure it'll be fine. I just... 
 I just want to lie down, really. 
 After everything you've done? 
 I'll do it myself! 
 You carry on. 
 There's no point in spoiling it all. 
 I'll take Tom back so you can enjoy yourself. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Hey... 
 I meant every word, by the way. 
 What now? You said we could stay! 
 I want to go back with Dad. 
 Mum! Mum! 
 You broke the mirror. 
 Yeah. 
 ( Door opens and closes ) 
 This one girl there, Isobel, her mum works for Dad. 
 She said her parents got divorced last year and her mum cries all the time. 
 What? 
 She was talking to me about her mum. 
 Why are you talking about divorce? 
 I don't know. 
 We talked about loads of stuff. 
 What are you doing? 
 Making a cup of tea. Do you want something? 
 Can I have a Coke? 
 No. 
 Squash? 
 Yeah, OK. 
 I'll bring it up. 
 OK, thanks. 
 Tom... 
 Love you. 
 ( She sobs ) 
 ( Knocks on door ) 
 What was that noise? 
 I'm just... throwing a few things away. 
 Isobel said that, when the divorce was happening, she thought she'd have to live with her dad in Reading. 
 She said it was horrible. 
 I don't know. 
 Good shopping in Reading. 
 I mean the divorce. The divorce was horrible. 
 Tom, what's the matter? Where's this come from? 
 Isobel. 
 Has Dad said anything? 
 Dad? 
 Is that why you were annoyed? Have you had an argument? 
 No. 
 Mum, if you do get divorced, I don't want to move. I like it here. 
 Tom, we're not... 
 This is your home. 
 You'll live here as long as you like. 
 I promise. 
 OK. 
 ( Doorbell chimes ) 
 Was that Dad? 
 It's a bit early. 
 Maybe he's drunk. 
 Oh, don't be silly. 
 I've never seen you drive like that before. 
 I'm ill. 
 Can I... Can I come in? 
 Is... Tom upstairs? 
 I'm having a rum and Coke. You? 
 No, no, I'm fine. 
 Erm, is that Simon's stuff? 
 How long have you known? 
 What? Known what? 
 I found his other phone in the boot. 
 Pictures of them together. Your texts. 
 You need to be honest with me now before I really get f*cked off. 
 How long have you known? 
 Oh, God, Gemma... 
 Yeah. 
 Did you tell him? 
 I haven't said anything except I'm ill. 
 Answer my question. 
 ( She clears her throat ) 
 Well, erm... he came in with something maybe... maybe four weeks ago. 
 Four weeks? 
 I thought it might be an STI, so I asked him about sexual partners. 
 Today just gets better and better(!) - Oh, no, it's OK. 
 In the end, it was fine. 
 It's just that, when I asked him the question, he paused and... so I guessed. 
 And since then, I have been telling him every week, texting him, "You deal with this or I will." 
 Oh, I am so sorry! 
 Can I give you a... 
 What? 
 A hug? 
 No. 
 I don't know who you are. 
 Neil. Anna. His assistant. 
 You. Who else? 
 If that's who was on the phone, that's probably it. 
 Her parents, presumably? 
 I don't know. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 And don't say it's because you didn't want to take sides. 
 Well, technically, I'm not allowed to tell you anything. He's my patient. 
 He's my husband! 
 I thought it would be better if he told you himself. 
 He promised me he would. 
 How long has it been going on? 
 Well, I'm not... I'm not sure. 
 No, you've asked. He's told you. 
 Three months. 
 I'm sure it's not serious. 
 I mean, it's serious for you. 
 You warned him, yesterday, when I talked about the blonde hair. 
 Oh, God. I'm so sorry. 
 You should be. 
 Gemma, please... 
 No! 
 Anyway, I've decided. 
 When Simon gets back, he'll move out. 
 What, forever? 
 Because, I mean, it's probably just s*x, isn't it? 
 A midlife crisis? 
 He probably knows he's made a mistake, still loves you and... 
 Whose side are you on? 
 I don't want to be on a side. 
 Wrong answer! 
 Yours. 
 Go back to the party. 
 He should have a good time and really enjoy himself. 
 I don't think... 
 Don't tell him that there's anything wrong. 
 I want him to come in and see those suitcases and understand in that second... exactly what he's lost. 
 I'd like to stay here with you. 
 No. 
 I... don't think that you should be on your own. 
 I think, if you want us to stay as friends, you should do exactly as you're told. 
 Of course. 
 ( Car pulls up outside ) 
 Hi. 
 ( Simon urinates ) 
 ( Urine splashes on floor ) 
 ( He continues to urinate ) 
 ( Belt being buckled ) 
 I loved that. It was amazing. 
 The... party. 
 Not the piss. 
 Simon... 
 You should be in bed. You're ill. 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 I'm really tired. 
 Sorry! Sorry! Drunk. 
 Drunk. 
 Can you bring some water up, please? 
 ( Simon snores gently ) 
 ( Mobile phone alarm sounds ) 
 ( Alarm continues ) 
 ( He turns the alarm off ) 
 Morning. 
 I forgot to turn off the alarm. 
 It's a good job you didn't. You need to be up. 
 Why? 
 Right! Yes! 
 Tour of the ground, meet the players. Are you excited? 
 Dad, were you drunk last night? 
 Don't know what you're talking about, mate. I didn't touch a drop. 
 How are you? 
 Better. 
 What was it? 
 What? 
 You didn't feel well. 
 I don't know. 
 Just had a pain in my stomach. 
 You should get it checked out. 
 Yeah, I will, if it carries on. 
 Enjoy it. 
 Yeah, I will. 
 Bye! 
 Ah! Ah! Ah! 
 Was I all right last night? 
 Were you "all right"? 
 I didn't say anything to upset you? 
 You didn't have a chance. 
 You came in, went to the loo, then passed out. 
 Sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 It was your birthday. You're supposed to have a good time. 
 Thanks. 
 Your wing mirror's off. 
 Yeah. 
 What happened to you last night? 
 You hit the champagne a bit hard? 
 I know what you doctors are like! 
 I was ill. 
 But... better this morning? 
 I'm... I'm in a hurry. 
 'Gem, seriously... now that you know, you can't just... 
 They're going to Villa Park to see a game. 
 A... A special tour. 
 Tom won it in a school raffle, so... 
 Gem, you need to tell him. 
 He's been looking forward to it. 
 So, update on this morning -- Locum's here. So is Dr Barton. 
 Dr Mitchel's ill. And Jack... 
 Jack doesn't work here any more. 
 He left a message saying he was going to sue. 
 What for? 
 He sounded drunk. 
 My computer's packed up. 
 Already? 
 That has to be a record. 
 Morning! 
 Call the man, check it's not the whole system. 
 It's the whole system. 
 God, this place is a joke. 
 Sorry. 
 Let's just start. 
 Doctor... 
 Anwar Shamsi? 
 Yeah. 
 Hi. 
 Doctor, it's urgent. 
 Gordon, we have to stick to appointments. 
 Mr Shamsi, if you'd like to come with... 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm sorry, should I...? 
 Could you give me a second? 
 What is she doing here? Is she here to confront me? 
 No, I've just seen, she's on my list. It's a normal appointment. 
 She booked it a couple of days ago. Come here. 
 This is hard. I'm good at keeping my head together, but today... 
 Talk to Simon. 
 I will. 
 But before I do, I need the facts. 
 What is this relationship? 
 I mean, three months, is it a fling? 
 Yes. 
 He's never suggested it's anything... 
 What about her? 
 What does he see in her? 
 Apart from... 
 Gemma, wait! Stop. What are you...? 
 Kate Parks? 
 If you can come with me? 
 Sorry, I thought... 
 I'm here to see Dr Mahendra. 
 Dr Mahendra has too many appointments today. 
 Mr Shamsi, if you can wait five minutes? 
 Kate, you don't mind swapping, do you? 
 It speeds things up for everyone else. 
 Thanks. 
 So, Kate, how can I help? 
 Er, I've been feeling tired recently, like a cold, and it's not going away. 
 How long? 
 Couple of weeks. 
 All right. 
 So, if you take off your top and trousers, we'll have a look. 
 Top and trousers? Why do I need...? 
 To examine you. 
 You're in good shape. 
 I'm heading to the gym. I go every morning. 
 I've got a trainer. 
 Sounds wonderful. 
 You should try it. 
 Maybe I will. 
 You just lie on here for me, please. 
 So you work at your dad's restaurant? 
 Sometimes. 
 Just for a bit of money, but I'd rather... 
 Ouch. 
 Does that hurt? 
 No. 
 All right. 
 How about... this? 
 Ow! Yep. 
 Mm. 
 Yep. 
 It's a little tender. It's probably nothing. 
 But to be sure, I'm just going to get some blood samples. 
 Doesn't the nurse do that? 
 I don't mind. 
 I need to ask you a few standard questions. 
 OK. 
 How much do you drink on average? 
 Couple of glasses of wine. 
 A night? 
 A week. 
 And do you smoke? 
 No. Ah...! 
 Sexual partners? 
 Sorry? 
 I'm just trying to rule a few things out. 
 Do you have any sexual partners? 
 One. 
 I don't tend to sleep around. 
 Are you having s*x regularly? 
 Erm... 
 Not enough. 
 He's married. 
 He...? 
 Right. 
 But unhappy. 
 Though it's sad, actually. 
 Why doesn't he just leave his wife? 
 Family, I suppose. 
 But the wife doesn't suspect? 
 Not a clue. 
 Hm... 
 Sounds complicated. 
 You can put your clothes on now. 
 You seem fine. 
 I hope you don't mind all the questions, but it helps to get a picture and you seem very healthy. 
 Just in case, could you pop next door, pee in that and bring it back? 
 Yeah. No problem. 
 ( Door opens ) 
 Excuse me. 
 ( She sighs heavily ) 
 This'll just take a minute. 
 We'll do the bloods, see what comes back. 
 It's probably just a cold. 
 In the meantime, take it easy and avoid doing anything strenuous or stressful. 
 What are the bloods for? 
 Measures all sorts. 
 Iron, sugar... 
 And that one? 
 Oh, this is just a... 
 What? What is it? 
 Kate... are you having unprotected s*x? 
 Erm... 
 No. 
 Have you been trying for a child? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Two lines means it's positive. 
 Sorry, are you saying I'm...? 
 Yes. 
 You're pregnant. 
 I assume the father is... this man. 
 It's a lot to take in, I know. 
 You'll want to consider the stability of this... relationship. 
 Can I see Dr Mahendra? 
 She is my doctor and this is a shock. 
 So can I see her instead? 
 Please? 
 I'll let you know. OK? 
 OK... 
 Excuse me. 
 Gordon, just wait. You're next. 
 Anwar Shamsi? 
 Anwar? 
 He just left. 
 Really? 
 Mr Shamsi! 
 Hi. 
 Well, I'm a solicitor with a client that needs me urgently. 
 Your receptionist said, if I had the first appointment of the day, I'd be straight in. 
 I'm so sorry. I hope she explained, there's no guarantees. 
 I'm having quite a morning. 
 Why have you come out here? 
 That's not normal. 
 Because men your age don't tend to see doctors when you should, and you look extremely worried, so I'm not going to let you leave until you tell me the problem. 
 I'm often sick first thing in the mornings. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Often? 
 Yeah, every few days. What, are we going to do this here? 
 Yeah, yeah. You drink a lot? 
 Not usually. 
 Look forward. 
 Recently, I can't sleep. I worry about things. So, yeah... 
 I have a drink. 
 Your eyes are a little bloodshot. 
 I take it you've googled your symptoms? 
 Er, yeah. 
 And? 
 Well, it says... being sick like that first thing in the mornings could be a warning of a brain tumour. 
 Yeah. 
 That's possible. But there are many more likely explanations. 
 Tummy bug, virus or your late-night drinking. 
 So it doesn't suggest anything to do with the brain? 
 Not unless there's more to say. 
 Are you sure you don't want to come in for a moment? 
 No, if you think it's nothing, then I should go. 
 Thank you. 
 So, she's not going to keep it and she doesn't want anybody to know. 
 Not Simon? 
 No. 
 She's going to find somewhere they'll do it as soon as possible. 
 Isn't she worried that I might tell him? 
 Well, why would you? 
 I mean, as far as she's concerned, you're oblivious. 
 But... Simon. 
 He should know she's pregnant. 
 What? 
 Gemma... 
 He'd want to know. 
 Do you want to make things work with him? 
 Because, if she ends up with his baby, then forget it. 
 Her and this child are going to be in your life forever. 
 You don't have to tell him. 
 It's better for him if you don't. 
 Besides, according to the General Medical Council and every professional standard, you're not allowed to. 
 So be quiet for the next 24 hours and let it happen. 
 Then talk to your husband and sort out your marriage. 
 And this girl is a fling. 
 You're not. 
 Don't tell him. 
 We had to take penalties and when I took mine, I fell over. 
 He was really serious. 
 He did this long run-up and then he just... 
 Yeah, all right. Thanks, mate. 
 How did you do? 
 Erm, I scored. 
 No! Did you? 
 Yeah, and he was a professional keeper. 
 Tom was really good, actually. They said he was the best. 
 Oh, well done! 
 I am so pleased you had a good time. 
 Yeah. 
 How was work? 
 A mess. 
 Why? 
 Just appointments, you know? 
 You all right, though? You feeling better? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 You should come next time, Mum. 
 Watch him have another turn. You'd find it really funny. 
 Dad, that missed. 
 Yeah, all right! 
 Next weekend, we'll find a goal, we'll do penalties and settle this. 
 Er, can you deal with the humiliation? 
 He's just like all of them. 
 What do you mean? 
 It's what men are like. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. It's been proven statistically. 
 Men all fancy 22-year-old women. 
 Doesn't matter how old they are themselves or what they say, that's just who they're after, sexually. 
 They might happen to like their partner as well but, biologically, 22 and fertile is what it's all about. 
 He's just had a hot summer and messed it up. He'll come back. 
 I mean, you love him, don't you? 
 When it's done and she's got rid of the baby, give him hell and then let him back. 
 I shouldn't tell him? Give him a chance to... 
 Tell him? 
 You're sort of innocent sometimes, aren't you? 
 I mean, you're not. Clearly. 
 But you think the world's better than it is. 
 Yes. 
 I'll join you. 
 OK. 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 Hi... 
 What are you drinking? 
 Beck's. 
 Beck's and a rum and Coke. 
 I thought when you said you had a drink in the middle of the night, you meant in your kitchen. 
 Why are you here? 
 Well, it's Saturday night, Anwar, and, as you can see, I'm a party girl. 
 I couldn't sleep, either. 
 Why not? 
 Got a lot going on. 
 Like what? 
 At home. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Tell me about you. 
 You were holding something back this morning, weren't you? 
 Something you weren't saying. 
 I'm married. 
 OK. 
 Alesha's six months pregnant. 
 Congratulations. 
 Five years ago, I had this... dizziness. 
 They eventually did a scan and found a tumour, in my brain. 
 Couldn't operate. 
 Said it wasn't doing any harm at that point, but it was growing and that, one day, it would kill me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should've told Alesha at the time. 
 I just didn't want to scare her away. 
 She doesn't know? 
 If I tell her now, she'll ask why did you make all these promises, start a family, all this time...? 
 Go for another scan. 
 I came in because it'd be good to know if the symptoms fit. 
 Is this it? 
 You didn't tell me your history. 
 What do you think now? 
 I can't be sure. 
 Well, can you guess? 
 The symptoms fit. Talk to your wife. 
 Right. 
 There's two things. 
 There's the mistake and then there's the lie to cover it up, and the mistake is a lot easier to forgive. 
 You reckon? 
 I know. 
 If I tell her, that'll be it. 
 She'll find out eventually. 
 She'll see it in your notes. 
 Medical records are confidential. 
 Not the medical records. 
 The post mortem. 
 Sorry, but you married her. 
 You've made a promise. 
 Trouble at home. 
 Something's happened with your husband. 
 That's what normally sends women your age to a bar in the middle of the night, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 See, I do a lot of divorce and you should know that a woman might get the house, the assets, the children, but that doesn't mean that she's won. 
 Because, a few years later, he's with someone new, making lots of money, no real responsibility. 
 But she is struggling. 
 Kids, work, no time to move on. 
 We've all got problems that we can't solve. 
 Tell your wife the truth. 
 I can't. 
 Hey, we've got to go. 
 OK. 
 ( Mobile phone rings ) 
 ( Phone continues to ring ) 
 ( They laugh ) 
 I'm this way. 
 Erm, how much? 
 Ah, it doesn't matter. 
 No, go on. 
 7 for the cigarettes, 2.50 for the lighter. 
 Thank you. 
 You'll be all right getting back? 
 Who says I'm going back? 
 ( She laughs ) 
 Be careful, yeah? 
 Night. 
 Hey... 
 Want a drink? 
 Ah... 
 Urgh, what's going on in there? 
 Shower's broken. 
 No milk. 
 Fridge doesn't work. 
 Your flat's a shithole, Jack. 
 You're very welcome to go home. 
 When we first moved here, you and David had us over for dinner and looked after us. 
 You remember? 
 Yeah. 
 David's missed. 
 As you can see. 
 How long were you together? 
 Oh... 
 30 years. 
 Did you ever cheat? 
 No. 
 Did he? 
 There's something in your head. 
 Can you keep a secret? 
 Chuckling : Don't be ridiculous, Gemma. I'm an alcoholic. 
 Of course I can keep a secret. 
 Simon's been sleeping with another woman. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Are you two...? 
 I haven't told him that I know. 
 Why not? 
 Because I'm not that woman that gets cheated on and... finds out and has screaming rows. 
 And I'm not... maintenance and divorce and all that stuff. 
 I'm better than that. 
 I'm clever. 
 Yeah, and, er... 
 I'm not a pissed widower who hasn't showered in three weeks. 
 I'm clever, too. 
 Doesn't mean a thing. 
 She came to the surgery today, this other woman, and I did some tests. 
 Turns out she's pregnant. 
 She's decided to have an abortion and not tell anyone. 
 She went to see you? 
 I told her I was the only doctor available. 
 Be careful... 
 Yeah. 
 I'm not entirely surprised. 
 In his 20s, Simon used to sleep around. 
 Always in the Crown. 
 Different girl every other week. 
 Simon? 
 Then when he came back from London with you, we all thought he'd grown up. 
 No-one's ever told me that before. 
 Well, they wouldn't. 
 His dad cheated on his mum, didn't he? 
 Left her. 
 Yeah. 
 My dad loved Scotch. 
 Sons are their fathers. 
 I hope not. 
 Three weeks, you couldn't use the sink? 
 Look, while it's been lovely to be dragged home by someone who's actually more depressed than myself, maybe we should call it a night? 
 Urgh! 
 Click! 
 What's wrong? 
 Gout. 
 Diagnosed by me. You don't need to see it. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 You can't live like this. 
 You should tell him you know. 
 Tell him she's pregnant. 
 I'm not ethically allowed to. 
 Tell him all of it. 
 Then... take your son and leave. 
 Start again. 
 It's just a fling. It doesn't... 
 It doesn't mean he won't do it again. 
 Look, he's lived here all his life. You don't need to stay. 
 Sometimes, it's the place that's the problem. 
 Hm? 
 ( Mobile phone beeps ) 
 I woke up this morning and you weren't there. 
 I came down to work. I couldn't sleep. 
 I was dead to the world. 
 Weeks are long at the moment. 
 I know that's always true for you, but... we start the build in a week, so it's full on, you know? 
 And all that running around with Tom yesterday... 
 You're having an affair. 
 Aren't you? 
 I'm convinced of it. 
 You're convinced? 
 OK... 
 There would be two things, if you were. 
 There would be the relationship itself. 
 The s*x, all of that. 
 And then there would be the lie. 
 Gem... 
 I... 
 I think that I... could accept the relationship, eventually... if you put an end to it. 
 We said, when we got married, that there would probably be other people that we fancied over a lifetime. 
 Yep, yep. Yes, we did say that. 
 So the lie would be the bigger problem. 
 If you'd been with someone else and you didn't just come out and tell me, then that would be the real betrayal. 
 Don't you think? 
 And I don't want to prove it. I don't want to catch you. 
 I want you to be honest. 
 Unprompted. 
 To just tell me. 
 To say, "Yes. I'm sorry. But, yes." 
 "I have been seeing someone else." 
 You can. 
 And then... all of the consequences, we can talk about all of it together. 
 But that'd be hard, but it'll be better. 
 For both of us. 
 Because... actually... even if you have done this... I think I still really love you. 
 I'm not. 
 ( She sobs ) 
 Where has this come from? 
 You... 
 You follow me to Mum's and now this. 
 Why would you suddenly think...? 
 It's OK. 
 It doesn't matter. You've said you're not. You're not. 
 You really think I could do that to you? 
 It's working too hard. 
 Yeah. Work. 
 That's it. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey, Tom. Sleep well? 
 Cereal's there, love. 
 You want toast? 
 Sure? 
 Morning! 
 Hi! 
 Fancy a drive? It's got wing mirrors and everything! 
 Leave her alone! 
 My two alarms go off at 7.30 and then a woman arrives at my door, pushes in, starts packing my bag. 
 Informs me her name is Casey and there's a taxi waiting. 
 Carly. 
 She tells me, if I don't get in it, Gemma Foster will have me arrested. 
 Practising medicine while under the influence. 
 Plenty of evidence, if I need it. 
 You're going on holiday. 
 I can't afford a holiday. 
 All expenses paid. Out and open return, but stay there a while. 
 Your train will be here in a minute. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I found these in your flat. 
 Sleeping pills. 
 Yes. 
 And these to stop the vomiting. 
 But I didn't go through with it. 
 But you kept the pills, in case you changed your mind. 
 This is an intervention, Jack, so trust me. 
 Sometimes it's the place that's the problem. 
 You'll be met when you get there. 
 By whom? 
 Mary. 
 Mary who? 
 She's a friend. 
 What happened with the girl? 
 What are they going to do? 
 No. 
 You told him? 
 He doesn't deserve to know. 
 A friend? 
 I think you'll like her. 
 You're mad. 
 It's a bit nicer today. 
 Yeah. 
 At last. 
 You're all right? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Thank you. 
 You didn't sleep last night. 
 Do I look that bad? 
 When you came in last week... there was a change. 
 You kept a distance from him. 
 You know, don't you? 
 About this other woman. 
 Simon swore me to secrecy. 
 But he told me about it. 
 He's acting exactly like his father. 
 I'm sorry. 
 She's pregnant. 
 Kate. 
 Her doctor told me. 
 She's having an abortion today. 
 He doesn't know? 
 No. 
 When's it happening? 
 Soon. 
 One o'clock. 
 Tell him. 
 Why should I? 
 He's got a right to know. 
 'We're really close. 
 'All the preparation's done so, literally, a couple of weeks, that's what we're looking at to start. 
 How long, then, until it's finished? 
 Eight months. 
 Right. 
 Tea? 
 Er, no, thanks. 
 Biscuit, then? 
 OK. 
 I'll, er, bring the model in one day. You can see it. 
 Tom, mate, you going to tell Gran about what we did yesterday? 
 Well, we went on a tour of Villa Park, it's a football ground, and it was really, really good. 
 We saw everything -- the pitch, the changing rooms, the museum bit at the back of the club with the history. 
 Can you remember when it was built? 
 Yeah. 
 What? 
 Go on, then, what year? 
 1897 it was built originally, but they've replaced most of it now. 
 Is it big? 
 Massive, yeah. 
 ( Chatter fades into the background ) 
 We got a tour. Only, like, celebrities or whatever get it normally. 
 That was really cool, actually. 
 And then we went and... 
 ( Mobile phone buzzes ) 
 Sorry. 
 Hi. 
 Yeah, just, erm... 
 Just give me a minute. 
 We went and met the players and had a go on one of the goals. 
 Dad missed. It was really funny. 
 Wow. 
 And you won this day out? 
 In a raffle, yeah. It was second prize. 
 Second prize? 
 Well, that's a good raffle. 
 Very lucky. 
 Dad's always on his phone. 
 He's very busy. 
 I'm really sorry. Erm, an investor's pulled out. 
 I need to get on the phone to see if he'll reconsider. 
 The paperwork's in the office. I need to take the car. Can I? 
 No problem. We'll get a taxi home. 
 Sorry, Mum. 
 It's OK. 
 See you later, mate. 
 See you. 
 Will you take the cups out to the kitchen? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 You know where it is, don't you? 
 Down the corridor, on the right. 
 Yep, I know. 
 If you put them in the dishwasher... 
 I know, I know. 
 Do you think it's serious? 
 Well, when they make a decision on this child... you'll know. 
 But... two years, it says something. 
 Two years? 
 Ros said it was three months. 
 Oh, Gemma. No. 
 For two years?! 
 I thought you knew. 
 You said you'd found out about it. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Gemma. 
 Why don't you come and sit down? 
 All sorted? 
 Yeah, for now. 
 Love you. 
 She's not happy I told him, but she's clearly pleased he knows. 
 They're going to keep it? 
 I think so. 
 It's two years. 
 Yeah. 
 He lied. 
 Seems that's what he does. 
 Jack said, when Simon was young, he had a different girl every week. 
 You never told me. 
 You were at school with him. 
 It didn't matter. I thought he was committed. 
 But when you found out that he was cheating... were you surprised? 
 To be honest... I'm surprised it took him so long. 
 Where are you going? 
 Work. 
 I've got work to do. 
 Morning. 
 You told my wife everything! 
 Absolutely against the code of ethics and the law. 
 Do you want to talk in private? 
 Not acceptable. 
 What did she say when she called you back? 
 She was upset. Some mad woman calling her in the middle of the night. 
 She thought I'd been up to something at first. 
 But she asked me if what you'd said was true. 
 And I said, "Yeah." 
 What did you decide? 
 She's, erm... 
 She's going to come with me, to the scan. 
 Good. 
 Still worried what they're going to find, though. 
 Of course. 
 But the point is, you calling her like that was illegal. 
 I know. 
 You shouldn't do it. 
 Understood. 
 Would you like to make a formal complaint, then? 
 No. 
 Boy or girl? 
 It's a little girl. 
 Er... 
 You said you did a lot of divorce work. 
 Yeah. 
 I do. Why? 
 I'd like to book an appointment. 
 Neil, could we find a moment to go over my accounts? 
 Sure. 
 Over dinner, maybe? 
 The moment I tell Gemma, I lose her. 
 And I lose my son. 
 From what he said last night, he still loves you. 
 And it's good to be loved, Gem. 
 It really is. 
 Go on, then. Why are you here, Neil? 
 Because, in the last five years, I've thought a lot about your body and it's got to the point that I desperately want to know what's going on underneath that dress.
