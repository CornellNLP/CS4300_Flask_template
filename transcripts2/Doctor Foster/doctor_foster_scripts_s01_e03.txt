 You're having an affair, but even if you have done this I think I still really love you. 
 I'm not. 
 ( She sobs ) 
 This girl is a fling. You're not. 
 She came into the surgery today and I did some tests. 
 You're saying I'm...? 
 Yes. You're pregnant. 
 He's just had a hot summer and messed it up. He'll come back. 
 When they make a decision on this child, you'll know. 
 But two years, it says something. 
 ( Crashing ) 
 For two years! 
 A woman might get the house, the assets, the children, but that doesn't mean that she's won. 
 You said you did a lot of divorce work. 
 I do. Why? 
 I'd like to book an appointment. 
 Hey! 
 Morning! 
 Early start for you. 
 Hi. 
 Looking good. 
 Meeting. 
 Right. 
 I've... 
 Yeah. 
 ( He coughs and splutters ) 
 ( Music plays on car stereo ) No... I've got a motorcycle accident just beyond Junction 6 of the... A4220 out of Parminster. ( Motorcyclist groans ) Is he going to die? No. The rider's male, conscious, possible fractured arm. Can you try and stay still for me. ( He moans ) I'm just lifting up your visor, OK? Er, no... I'm a doctor, I just happened to be passing. He's breathing, alert. Yes, yes, OK. Thank you. You seem fine, but I need you to stay absolutely still. Partly because of the risk of nerve damage, also I don't want blood on my shirt because I've got a really important meeting, is that all right? ( He murmurs ) Sorry? What? ( He retches ) ( He coughs ) Hi. Jesus! What happened to you? Traffic. My thoughts keep running over the last two years. Birthdays, holidays. When we've had s*x and I've told him that I love him. Walking around in the bedroom without any clothes on, thinking he likes what he sees... He was lying the whole time. Sorry, you're a lawyer, you don't need to hear this. It's fine. I asked you to bring in details of your finances... There. These are just your current account. Presumably, there are other savings, investments? He handles the money, always has done. Why? He said he was better at it. So, you don't know your financial situation at all? No, I suppose... This project, what's it called? Academy Green. And will it pay off? He says it's doing well. He "says"... Sorry. This is... No offence, but I'm not interested. This is really dull. This is not what my life is about. I just... I just want to skip to the bit where I move on. In a divorce, he'll officially take 50% of everything. Your salary, your savings, your pension. He cheated. Not me. Doesn't matter. 50% is the default. But if you're telling me he has complete control of your finances, he might already have hidden money away in preparation. Meaning... you could get even less. Are you happy with that? No, of course not. Look. By not telling him that you know, you've got an unusual advantage. You can look into this without him suspecting anything. So, what do I do? Depends what you want. I want my son to stay living in the town where he was born. I want to keep the life that I chose, the job that I love. My dignity. My money and my house. Good. Then, in the meantime, find out what he's planning. How much money he's got. And while you do that, play the dutiful wife so he doesn't suspect a thing. Morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. ( He clears throat ) Highbrook has a proud history. Generations of children have been educated here, including myself. Um, then, three years ago, the building was deemed unsuitable. The school relocated to a purpose-built facility, and now, I'm proud that the Academy Green development will give a new lease of life to this historic site. Man : Quite right! 20 luxury flats, right in the heart of town. ( Applause ) This isn't just a business opportunity for me, but a way of protecting the legacy of a building I love. So, I hope you'll all join me for a glass of champagne... Um, please take a brochure, and let's, um... Let's move forward! Let's build! Thank you. ( Chuckling and applause ) Was that all right? Yes. ( Hum of conversation ) That'll be you one day, Tom. Tom! It took ages, that one... Come and look at the model. Anna, Neil, come on. Yeah. He's not bad at this, is he? Public speaking. He's worried about his suit. Why? He says he looks like he's selling cars. Right, yes, I see what you mean! ( They chuckle ) Neil, I wanted to ask, could we find a moment to go over my accounts? I've always left it to Simon, but I've realised perhaps maybe I should pay more attention. I thought you could talk me through it. Sure. Over dinner maybe. Absolutely. And maybe don't mention it to Simon. I wouldn't want him thinking that I don't trust him. Of course. Well, just let me know when. Simon's right, this is historic. I gave Karl Lucas a hand job against that wall in 1993. And now, they're knocking it down! There was no internet or mobiles in the early '90s. So, in a town like this, nothing do except each other. Listen... Kate changed surgery. We got the paperwork through today. Makes sense. Still need me tomorrow? Yes. Never been undercover before. It's exciting. Thanks. OK. Mum? If you haven't seen the model, you should. Impressed? Mm, I suppose... Proud of your dad? A bit, yeah. Thank you. What for? Everything. It's my pleasure. Simon! Sorry, could you just cast your eye over this? ( Gravel crunches ) I can't do it. She's going to think I'm selling something, or mental. You've moved round the corner, just thought you'd say hello. People don't do that any more. They might if they're pregnant and want a sense of the community. Right, I'll just drop all that into the conversation(!) Say you're tired, put your hand on your tummy, and she'll work it out. Just... get her to like you. And then tomorrow, come back, get her talking about Simon, divorce, plans, anything. Worst that can happen, she shuts the door in your face. And if she does, I'll still give you the money. OK, OK. ( Message alert ) ( She sighs ) ( Door opens ) Hi! Um, my name's Carly, I just moved in round the cor... Well... and I'm, um... I am, too! Are you? Congratulations! ( They laugh ) ( She sighs ) Well, I'm sorry. I'll leave you in peace. It's nice to meet you though. I will do. Hopefully, I'll see you around or something. OK. Bye. ( Door closes ) ( Engine starts ) How did you know? We moved here when I was pregnant. First thing I did? Made friends. At least, that's what I thought they were. We can stop the current medication, but in terms of a replacement, it's difficult. Your pain has proven very resistant to treatment. From a medical perspective, I would advise we go on as we are. But that's not to say there aren't any practical steps to make you more comfortable that you could discuss with the staff here. We're having those conversations. Good. Good. All right. Thank you for coming. Thank you. That's it, then. We just give up. Mum, no... If you have a pain in your head like a drill, all day, and all night, how long do you wait? Wait? What do you mean? Mum, it'll be OK. It went well today? Yeah. Really well. Mm. Proud. You better get going. Call us if you need anything. Love you, Mum. You understand, don't you? Yes. I can't do this forever. I just can't. I... (I can't have this conversation.) We're not giving up. I promise. I'll look into options. See you very soon. ♪ My baby went away ♪ 
♪ He went away across the sea ♪ 
♪ It's been two years or so ♪ 
♪ Since I saw my baby go ♪ 
♪ And then this letter came for me... ♪ ( She sighs ) You don't look normal. You could just say I look nice. Well, yeah, that's what I mean. It's unusual. Thanks, Tom. Long day. Taxi's outside. Right. Where are you going again? Local Medical Committee dinner. Sounds boring. Right. OK. And that's a... What? And you wear heels for that, do you? I'm a woman on a night out, so it's heels or flats, and flats don't go, so... What do you want me to wear, trainers? No... just... You look really... What? It doesn't matter. No, don't stop there. I'm on the way out the house. I look really what? I'm knackered. Have we got any crisps? I've had a tough day, too. What time are you home? Late. I might've gone to bed. Does Tom know what he's having for dinner? Yes. And is there anything for... Leftovers in the fridge. Crisps are in the bottom left cupboard. Tom can show you if you get stuck. Right... ( Scraping ) ( She knocks ) Hi! Hi. I know this is weird, but I... I ordered a copy of this book, but I must've ordered it twice cos I got two copies through. And I thought, well, you're just down the road, you might want it. Is Gemma about? She's at a dinner. Oh. [SHE SNORTS] Annoying. You all right? Yeah. Told her yet? No. Who's Kate changed doctors to? We shouldn't talk about all this now. Is Tom...? Upstairs. Well, are you sure you don't want to send it back? Nah. It's... hassle. Well, I can give you the money for it. No. Go on. Thanks. Ros : 'I have come...' all the way over. It turns out, for no good reason, and I know you're going through a lot, but the normal thing, and the polite thing would be to ask me in for cup of tea. Well, do you want to come in? Er, cup of tea? Or a gin and tonic? Sure. Drink? ( He clears throat ) ( Drink pours ) Can I be honest with you? I keep forgetting I'm pregnant. You forget? Yeah, yeah... It wasn't planned. So, yeah... So, how's the dad? Sorry, are you...? Are you with the dad? No, erm... He was drinking eight pints a night and grabbing me when I got home, so, I had enough. Got rid of him. Good. Well, better without. You? Yeah, we're together. Yeah... He doesn't live here though, does he? You can tell, it's spotless. Yeah, well... Long story. Go on. 'People say that the perfect story is that you meet this one person and fall completely in love, and then from that moment,' you don't need anything else. Despite the fact that the world keeps changing. People change, as well. Your work, your house and everything alters, you're expected to stick with just this one person. And despite that sounding unlikely, when I met Gemma I thought I could. I thought, "Actually, yes." "I'll never need anyone else." What I didn't realise... is that it's possible to feel that about two different people at the same time. You're still in love with Ge... With Gemma. Yeah, of course. Yes! And Kate. Both of them. ( He chuckles ) The moment I tell Gemma, I lose her. And I lose my son. Weekends, evenings... and he'll know the truth and he'll hate me. And that's the only reason you haven't told her? She asked you to come tonight, didn't she? No! She suspects. All right, yes. Well, she... she doesn't think that you're with someone else. She's worried that you may be hiding something with the business, the money. She thought you might open up. Why would she think anything's wrong with the money? She may've noticed how stressed you look. I don't look stressed! Stressed is an understatement. Actually, you're right, you don't look stressed. You look ill. Is there something wrong with the money? Well, if there was, I wouldn't tell you now, would I? You'd just go straight back to Gemma. I'm not on her side. I'm stuck in the middle! I just want what's best! Tell me the truth. The truth about the money... ( Clattering ) .. is that everything's about this far from f*cked. 'Financial matters?' Yeah. As our accountant, I hoped you could talk me through things. Over dinner. Yeah. What, earnings, tax, that sort of thing? That sort of thing exactly. Right... Well, I'm afraid I didn't bring any files with me. That's a shame. I forgot. I always had you down as organised. Me, too! We'll just have to enjoy the food. The way Simon describes you when you first met -- very different to now. How does he describe me? He makes you sound like an animal. Really? Feral. ( She laughs ) You don't see that? How is Simon? You see him more than I do some weeks. Tell me how he's getting on at work. Hmm... Simon's ambitious, as you know. This project's a big step for him. Will it make money? I expect so. So, it's going well? ( He clears throat ) He won't tell me. Thinks I'll worry. Right... As you know from our accounts, I've supported him over the last few years as he's started out. So, I'm keen it doesn't all go wrong now. You're spying. What? Like a doctor, I can't disclose anything that happens with my clients... I'm not. .. even if the person asking... is extremely persuasive. I'm just making conversation. I don't want to talk about his work. I don't really want to talk about Simon, so if that's why you're here... I'm here because I think that life is passing me by and I'm missing out. I don't care what we talk about. ( Bottle clinks ) ( Wine pours ) Let me give you a test. I'm going to tell you why I'm here, and if it offends you, you can get up, go home. We never have to speak of it again. But if it doesn't... you can stay sat right there. Go on, then. Why are you here, Neil? Because in the last five years I've thought a lot about your body and it's got to the point that I desperately want to know what's going on underneath that dress. Basically, Gemma... I'm here because I think we'd have a really good time f*cking. 
 
 ( Footsteps approach ) Are you ready for the main course? Yes, I think we are. Carly : 'You've met her?' 'Couple of times. She's arrogant. 'Looks down at people.' Sorry, I sound like a bitch but... Is that why he wanted someone else? What? That she's arrogant. Well, he didn't. No, I mean... No, he didn't want "someone else". It was about us, we got on. He wasn't looking to cheat. Actually, that was always the problem. I said to him, you need to tell her straightaway, or it's over and that was... [KATE SIGHS] That was two years ago. And now, you've got a baby. Yeah. Yeah, I was going to get rid of it. Sorry, you... you probably don't want hear that. It's fine. I wasn't ready, but he knows I want kids eventually, so... So he said, "Why not?" Promised me that if I kept the baby, he'd tell her straightaway. But nearly two weeks later... He'd said we'd get a proper house together, that he'd move her out to London with their son. Has he got a divorce lawyer, all of that? I doubt it. He's showing no signs of breaking up with her at all. 'I've thought recently maybe I should... 'Should..? 'What, leave him? 'Well, how did you feel when you split up with yours? 'Terrible...' Right... for two days. And then, I felt better. So, you didn't regret it? Not at all. Ros : 'The only way out is to tell her the truth and deal with what happens. Simon : 'No...' I can do it. The money's there, it'll all be fine once we start selling the flats. It's close but I need time... Six months maybe. You want to keep all of this going for another six months?! I have to. What about the baby? Yeah, well... ( Door opens ) Oh... Hi, Ros. Hiya. When's Mum home? She might be late. You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Sure? Yeah. I was going to ask her something, but it doesn't matter. OK. Yeah, bye. Night, mate. I'll come and see you in a minute. (Tearfully) : Please don't tell her anything's wrong. Say the money's good. It'll all work out best for everyone in the end. I promise. Gemma : 'Go on, you've got something to say.' Ah, booked a room. Upstairs, they have good rooms. And I booked one. So, there it is. Now you know. I already knew. Oh? When I went to the bathroom, I checked with reception. You went to the bathroom when you first arrived. That's right. So, you've known my intentions all evening. Neil, I've known your intentions for five years. ( He laughs ) Oh, God! Argh, you make me sound desperate! It would only be desperate if you were trapped in this marriage with Anna, and completely in love with the woman across the street. But... I don't think that's the case, is it? I'm not unique, am I? I'm not the first "other woman". There have been other women, yes. What are you into? What you mean, um... Why do you do it, these women? Honestly? Pleasure. Right. So... Let me be specific. What are you into? Don't ask questions like that lightly, cos they have an effect coming from you. I know. Nothing weird. Shame. ( She giggles ) ( They laugh ) Physical. Sort of has to be physical. Look, Anna's great. I love her. But she's into it being... loving, calm, gentle. So... sometimes I like to... go for it. Right... ( She laughs ) I'm better at doing than describing. Oh, God! I don't f*cking know! I... I improvise. What about you? I think we start by taking off our clothes. I'm married. I made a promise. I'll let you into a secret. There are only two types of married men. Those you know who cheat on their wives, and... those who are better at hiding it. Every man I've met who's in a long-term relationship, they've all been unfaithful at one point or another. Really? It's biological. Men like s*x. They can hang around with one woman, but... only if, now and then, they're allowed to fulfil their function. I don't feel guilty. What about women? Well, I think women probably like s*x, too. The point is. It's... It's all very common. Up to you. ( She laughs ) ( He groans ) ( He clears throat ) Mmph! Got work. What, already? I have to go home first. I thought... we might have another go. When do we tell Anna? Yeah! Or Simon for that matter. Wait! What if we don't(!) I'm serious. She's my friend. Well, you didn't think about Anna too much last night. I know. She's going to be really upset... but she'd be far more upset if she finds out that we tried to hide it from her. What, er... What are you doing? I'm saying we should be honest. No, no. No, you're not, you're playing a game and I don't get it, so it's making me quite nervous. I don't like deceit. I'm not going to tell Anna about this and neither are you. If you did, I could tell Simon. Go ahead. I'll tell him myself. What do you want? Ah... Was last night... to blackmail me? In reverse order -- no. Last night was... because I fancy you and I wanted to have a good night. I enjoyed the s*x, the company. Last night was fantastic, everything I'd hoped for. But this morning, what do I want? Well, if you're asking me to lie... I want something to make up for it. Like what? Simon's accounts. His personal and business. Copies of everything stretching back the last three years, every detail, not just the official stuff. I'm going to have them looked at so don't try and hide anything. Gemma, that's a lot of work. I want them this afternoon... It's not possible to get all that stuff together. How long have you been married? 15 years? I've seen you and Anna together a lot. You look after her, you take her on holiday, I mean, you genuinely love her, don't you? She's what really matters. Yes. What we just did, it's... just a bonus. Um, why... Why do you want his accounts? Because I think there are things going on in our finances that I don't know about. Am I right? Now I see it. See what? Feral. This afternoon. Your office, or at home? Home. Anna's out. Honestly... it was really good. ( Door opens and closes ) Mum... ( She murmurs ) Late night? You don't look well. I'm fine. I just need a shower. What's the time? Eight o'clock. Oh... You have a good time? Yeah. What? Last night, Tom was looking at CheckMyGP, it's a ratings site for... What are you looking at that for? Harry told me about it. Because normally they say good things, and he's proud of you. Right. Right. So, what do you mean, "normally"? They... they started last night. ( Tom sighs ) Have you read all of these? Most of them. They're not true. We'll get them taken down, won't we? Sometimes people write things like this on the internet. Why? Someone wants to get at Mum. Don't worry, Tom. Who? We don't know. I'll deal with this. I should have a shower. Luke, finally... You've just seen Helen? Yes. And I agree with the specialist. There's not much to be done in terms of medication. So, we talked through changes to the home, management, coping strategies. I don't know that that's enough. Yeah. And she asked me to tell you that she wanted to see you. Today, if possible. OK, thanks. Busy morning! I give up! Ros. Sorry, can I just say that I'm not really comfortable with... flirting. Not at work. OK... Is that all right? Yeah, fine. Thanks. I've gone off him. Last night... The bad news is, I had to tell him you'd sent me. Why? Because he guessed, so I said all right, yes, you asked me to come round, but it was only cos you were worried about the money. OK, and? He said there's enough to keep the project going and in time it'll... it'll be OK. So, no problems then? He seemed sure that it would all work out. But if that's true, now that she's pregnant, why doesn't he just come out and tell me? I mean what's he waiting for? I'm told Kate has exactly the same question. How do you know? I know it's weird, but from what he said last night... he still loves you. Maybe that's the reason. And it's good to be loved, Gemma. It really is. 'So, as you can see, he's raided everything.' My friend said he had it under control. Well, your friend was wrong. Look... ISA, savings, Tom's fund for university. That money came from my parents. When they died. Er, remortgaged the house... I'm sorry? Well, presumably you know about that. You, um... You signed it. No, I didn't. OK, well, look, I don't give advice, I JUST do the accounts. But you really shouldn't have just left it up to him. He can barely add up, let alone run a business. Anyway, as you can imagine, all that wasn't nearly enough. He got halfway into it, secured the building, but had no funds for the development itself. Then this new investor arrives. Um, "White Stone", starts ploughing in cash. So far, just over a million, in a number of instalments. That's how he's managed to start the work. Who's "White Stone"? No idea. They're registered offshore, so I can't find out and Simon won't tell me. If that money keeps coming in, then what you've heard from your friend is right, he might get to the end of the project, sell the flats, make it all back, and a lot more. But, um, if for any reason, it stops, then, um... Well, he'll be bankrupt within a week. My savings, mortgage... everything. Gone. If Simon asks how you got this information... Yes, I'll make something up. And if you need any more information or advice... Well, we could meet again. ( She laughs ) I'm sorry...? Neil, I'm blackmailing you. Yeah. The truth is I don't really like Simon. He's a mate, he's a client, but he's patronising. Thinks he knows it all. It's ANNOYING. I keep thinking about last night. We could meet again, if you want. White Stone? Um, yeah. Will you keep trying to find out who it is? ( Door opens ) Hello! Not a bad day out there now. Got bread and wipes for the kitchen, but there was some... Hi, love. Oh! Hi! Hi. I didn't know you were here. Neil was helping with my accounts. I think we've got everything sorted, so I should probably head off. Sorry, I'm in a hurry... OK, sure. Bye! We'll see you later. Hey. Are you all right? 'He'll get nothing.' Once the divorce starts, it'll all come out, him taking your money, forging your signature. Yes. And the project will collapse probably. We'll lose it all. ( She sobs ) But I earn enough. And what he's done only strengthens my case. Tom and me, we'll be OK. And I promise we'll always look after you. What about him? You probably don't care, I understand that. But... you'll look after him? You won't leave him with nothing? It'll be fair. I promise. ( Voicemail tone ) Hi, Anwar, I think I've got everything. I want to proceed. Can you call me back? Hey. What's the matter? Are you OK? I did it. What? Your boyfriend? Oh, sh1t, he followed me. We can't do this in here. I told you, I'm only keeping it if you finish it with her. You said you would! I want to. It's not good enough, that. Anyway... It's gone now. It's better. It's my body. It's up to me. You know why I couldn't tell her. Either go and tell her now, or that is it. It was my child, too. Are you going to go and tell her? No. You're right, you shouldn't wait any more. ( Door closes ) 'He left. She waited.' He didn't come back. And do you think it's really over? She had it done without telling him. He looked like he'd never forget that. Maybe it doesn't matter, but in the end, he was the one that finished it. He told her not to wait. That doesn't change anything. ( Tom laughs ) ( Tom giggles ) ( Laughter from TV ) ( She pierces loudly ) Everything all right? Just about. Hard at the moment, isn't it? ( Laughter from TV nearby ) We were watching a thing. It's... it's funny. I'll be over in a minute. ( Phone rings ) Hello? Yes? Yeah, yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can. I'm so sorry. Have the police spoken to you? No. They just said to wait. She took an overdose of sleeping pills. Left a short note. It says that the pain had got too much, and she couldn't carry on. But, then, why didn't she tell us. She did. Yes, but... We knew she was suffering, there just wasn't anything that we could do to help. How did she get the pills? In the note, she talks about storing them up for a long time, pretending to take them and saving them. This sort of thing, it does happen. You never gave her..? I'm sorry? Something they asked me. Whether you might. I wouldn't. Oh, Simon. What's happened? Come and sit down. Mate, you know Granny was, um, very ill. She was hurting all the time. Yeah, yes. Well, I'm afraid, last night, she passed away. She died in her sleep. She's... she's... It was peaceful. She's not in pain any more. ( Tom sobs ) [TEARFULLY:] It's really sad. I'm sorry. Oh, Tom... I thought it might help. Maybe you could give it a try? You think it's silly, hey? I'm just going to go and see your dad. When my mum and dad died, the woman who looked after me, Mary, she gave me a notebook to write down how I felt. Stupid. Not at all. ( Phone buzzes ) Sorry. Hi. Anwar. Yeah... No. I've changed my mind. We're all right. We're going to try again. ( He sobs loudly ) ( He cries ) "What's typhoid"? How can you simply take him back? Because we have a child together. A life together. 14 years under our belt, so if there's any way of keeping all of that, I have to try. And you honestly think that he's never going to see her again? ( Text alert ) You think I'm lying? You still don't trust me?
