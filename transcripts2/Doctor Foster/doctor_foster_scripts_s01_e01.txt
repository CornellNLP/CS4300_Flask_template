 ( Belt buckle being undone ) 
 ( Clothes drop to the floor ) 
 Hm... 
 You miss me? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 ( She laughs ) 
 There's only a few days to go and there's a lot to arrange. 
 You didn't need to. It's just a few friends. 
 And we've got Neil and Anna tonight. 
 It's all under control. 
 Is this yours? 
 Yes, actually. Dry lips. 
 Bit girly. 
 Red? Nothing wrong with that. 
 And it was the only one they had. 
 Remember you're taking Tom to school. 
 I'm late. 
 Me, too. 
 Worth it, though. 
 Oh, no-one's going to notice. It looks fine. 
 What does? 
 No, nothing. 
 Morning, Mum. 
 Morning, darling. 
 You know we're late? 
 The form for the trip's in your bag. 
 Thanks. 
 No problem. 
 And don't forget your coat. 
 Oh, yeah. OK. 
 All ready, mate? 
 Nearly. 
 Where's my scarf? 
 Here, have mine. 
 Really, no. It's... black. 
 I'm wearing blue. 
 I think you'll manage. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Dad, did you drive back last night? 
 Yeah. I had meetings. 
 What happens in a meeting? 
 What do you mean? 
 What do you do? 
 You sit and drink coffee and discuss things. 
 See you later! 
 Bye! 
 Bye, Mum! 
 'Right, we're on the food, the cake. Like, you're doing the decorations.' 
 'Not a problem. What would you like?' 
 Balloons, bunting. 
 'Oh, absolutely.' 
 Oh, we talked about putting something behind the bar. 
 'Very generous.' 
 Enough so that they'll have a good time. 
 Not so much that I'll need a stomach pump. 
 'You know what Neil's like. I'll speak to the landlord.' 
 You're a life-saver. 
 'We'll catch up tonight.' 
 Lovely. Speak then, Anna. Bye. 
 Dr Foster... 
 Gordon. How are you? 
 Not good at all. 
 That's why I'm here. Back pain. 
 OK, well, we'll deal with that inside. 
 I was just saying hello, really. 
 Oh, right. Well, how are you? 
 Good. Bit of a disaster with the hair this morning, but... 
 Yes, I can see that. 
 Good morning, Julie. 
 Not really. 
 What's happened? 
 Jack's ill. Not coming in. 
 Oh, why? 
 That's his final warning. 
 What did he say? 
 Gastroenteritis. 
 I saw him in the pub last night. 
 All right. Er, how many on his list this morning? 
 12. 
 Julie see what you can do. Take the appointments down to eight minutes. 
 OK. 
 Eight minutes is impossible. 
 Talk faster! 
 See you later, Luke. 
 Not a flicker. 
 He's too young for you. 
 Maybe. 
 But I accidentally on purpose brushed up against his shirt the other day and he is toned like a b*st*rd. 
 You would if you could. 
 Ros! 
 Shall we make a start? 
 As you know, I live on my own and once a week my sister comes over. 
 Bit of a drive for her, but she brings the shopping. 
 Meals. 
 Soup, tomatoes, meat, onions... 
 Yes. 
 She was there on a Thursday. I had a headache that day, which isn't the primary reason I'm here. 
 But now I mention it, I've had them for years. It's on your notes. 
 Mm... 
 Last weekend, I saw a documentary. 
 They said headaches have historic... 
 Gordon, can we get back to the specific symptoms that brought you in? 
 I lay there with my eyes open all night. 
 I only get a couple of hours and then I'm falling asleep in the day. 
 Have you had any recent big changes? 
 Moving house? New job? 
 No. 
 Do you have a partner? 
 Aren't there pills? 
 Sleeping pills, yes. But I wouldn't prescribe them in your case. 
 You wouldn't prescribe sleeping pills for someone who can't sleep? 
 Only if we've tried everything else or there's a medical condition and that's rare. 
 You think I'm lying? 
 No. 
 Yes. Because you're not giving me the pills, even though they do exist and would help my problem. 
 I think we should try some other things first. 
 We're opening a new restaurant tomorrow. 
 I would love it if you could come so I can say thank you. 
 Oh, it's fine. 
 No, no, please! 
 Look, I'll send through the details. 
 OK. 
 So I don't need to do anything? 
 Keep taking these. 
 But other than that, no. 
 Good. 
 Gemma... thank you so much. 
 No problem. 
 Dr Foster went to Gloucester in the pouring rain. 
 She stepped in a puddle right up to her middle and never was seen again! 
 Well, I hope not! 
 It's good to see you, Poppy. 
 You're very brave. 
 Thanks! 
 Bye. 
 I did my science and Harry checked it, so I know I got it right. 
 Right, is Harry good? 
 He's a genius. He did his IQ and got 140, which is loads. 
 Gemma? 
 Hi! How are you? 
 Oh, sorry, I don't... 
 Oh, Becky. Simon's assistant. 
 Oh, yes. 
 You didn't recognise me. It's fine. It's been a while. 
 Hi, Tom! Haven't seen you in ages. 
 Hi. 
 So your daughter goes to Highbrook? 
 Isobel. Yeah, she just started. 
 Me and her dad broke up middle of last year, so... 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Yeah, well, we just thought Isobel might like a new start, so... 
 Oh, and the homework club is a blessing! 
 I can do the whole day, finish off, lock up and be here at 5.30 to pick her up myself. 
 I'm so sorry I didn't recognise you. 
 Oh, no! No-one does anymore. 
 After the split, I wanted a new start, too. So I went blonde. 
 Mum wasn't happy. Said I looked like Tess Daly, as if that's a bad thing. 
 But I like it. And Mum's mad, so... 
 Anyway, I'll see you soon. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 OK? 
 Mum? 
 Mum! 
 Yeah! 
 Do you know how many bones there are in the human foot? 
 26. 
 And 33 joints. 
 And more than 100 muscles, tendons and ligaments. 
 Mum, you're a geek. 
 I know. 
 I was stuck in traffic for 20 minutes but, bearing in mind I started late today, I think I've done pretty well. What's more, I have wine. 
 Perfect. 
 Can I do anything? 
 You can pour me a glass. 
 Oh, before I forget... 
 Did you cope with the colour? 
 The colour was fine. 
 Mate, you going to come and say hello tonight? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Mum said I don't have to. 
 Oh... You're not a kid anymore. 
 Yeah, but you never let me leave and you tell these stories. 
 Up to you. 
 Right. 
 So... tell me about your weekend. 
 Er... well, it's a conference. 
 A load of men gather in a cheap hotel, talk about planning legislation. 
 What about the evenings? Do you go out? 
 Occasionally. 
 Every night in the casino. Roulette, cocktails, beautiful women... 
 It's Hemel Hempstead. 
 What's so fun about casinos? 
 I mean, in the end, you always lose. 
 Ah, well, now, let me explain... 
 No, I don't think you will. 
 ( Doorbell chimes ) 
 Ah-ha! 
 OK, see you later, Mum. 
 Do you want a juice to take up? 
 No, thanks. 
 Hey! Welcome. 
 Hey! Good timing! 
 Have you just got in? 
 We saw you pull up. 
 I had to stop for booze. 
 No need! 
 Hello. 
 Just the kind of thing you feel... 
 It was a resort. But it, you know, it really wasn't bad. 
 You know, open the door and you were right there on the beach. 
 Yeah, and they have activities for children. 
 I'm sure Tom would love it. 
 There's kids everywhere. 
 Screaming! 
 They were just having fun! 
 He told them to shut up. 
 I did not tell them to shut up! 
 "Pipe down," like an old man! 
 It's an expression. 
 You can imagine how popular that made us. 
 Gem hates feeling trapped, so I'm not sure a resort's really our kind... 
 It's not me! I'd be fine. 
 There's no point in us staying near the sea. 
 You don't like water. 
 He's even nervous in the shower. 
 What? 
 He can't swim, is the issue. 
 I can. 
 Barely. 
 Didn't you learn at school? 
 I had asthma, so... 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, I grew out of it. 
 I rescued him once. 
 Jesus, Gem, really? I don't think we have to... 
 I think we do. 
 I must've told you. 
 Don't think so! 
 Oh, we were on holiday in Greece. 
 On the beach. 
 And he goes in for what I can only assume was meant to be a paddle. 
 Two minutes later, I look over, realise he's been swept out and he's drowning. 
 So I leave our stuff and run to help. 
 Baywatch. 
 Baywatch, right. Exactly. 
 Slow motion. 
 You can stop thinking about it now! 
 I swim over, get him back to the shore and he's fine. 
 But of course, he's coughing and wheezing and playing it up. 
 It was real, actually. 
 And very humiliating. 
 We'd only been together a month or two. 
 Three months! 
 Yeah, right. But here's the thing... 
 I can hardly breathe. I nearly died. 
 Nearly died? 
 Yeah. 
 But what happened made me realise... she was the one. 
 This is her... and I never want to let her go. 
 Clever, funny. 
 Hot in a bikini. 
 But also, back then... bright red hair. 
 You didn't! 
 It was a phase. 
 That night I proposed. 
 Right! So that was...? 
 Yeah. 
 And for some reason I said yes. 
 Well, you did well. 
 You didn't. 
 You should learn to swim properly. 
 I'm fine. 
 Yeah! 
 I'll teach you. 
 Arm bands! 
 Don't bother, mate. 
 Listen, when I hit 40, I gave up on a whole load of stuff. 
 Never going to. Don't want to. 
 So, how are you feeling about your birthday party? 
 Good, I think. 
 I'm not being told any details... 
 I'm in charge of the barbecue, mate, so that's all you really need to know. 
 Alert the authorities! 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 ( Conversation fades ) 
 Oh, God! 
 I didn't see you. 
 The canapes are my first priority now I'm back. 
 So if it's the canapes that were bothering you, it's all fine. 
 It's not the canapes. 
 No. 
 I found a long, blonde hair on Simon's scarf. 
 A long, blonde hair? 
 Yeah. 
 And you think he's been with someone else? 
 I don't... 
 A long, blonde woman? 
 It's... It's paranoia. I know. 
 Lots of people have blonde hair. 
 It's just I've never... 
 I mean, I'm sleeping with Simon. It is probably mine. 
 I'm joking! 
 Oh, God, you are worried. 
 Look, I mean, it doesn't even have to be a woman. 
 Men can be blond. 
 Horses? 
 It's just once you have the thought... 
 Do you trust him? 
 Yes. 
 Yes! 
 Then trust him. 
 Otherwise, you'll start checking his phone and his pockets. 
 You two are fantastic. 
 The hair is just a hair. 
 Now, I see what you've done with your wine glass and I approve. 
 You work too hard. 
 Wine is good. 
 Come on... 
 ( Dinner party chatter in the distance ) 
 Bye, guys. 
 Bye! Thank you! 
 Come on, trouble, let's be having you. 
 ( Laughter ) 
 Does it matter? 
 Oh, fun. 
 Yeah... 
 Have I done something? 
 What? 
 You're acting like I've done something wrong. 
 Tired. 
 Love you. 
 You go up. I'll make tea. 
 I've got lip salve. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 And what else? A blonde hair and nothing on his phone. That's it? 
 Of course there's nothing. I shouldn't have even looked, but... his assistant went blonde recently. 
 So you're saying... 
 Yeah, they're either definitely sleeping together or she once hung up his scarf. I... 
 This is not like you. 
 Simon's never home until half seven. 
 He says that's when he finishes work. 
 OK... 
 But I met his assistant at the school gate and she said she locks up the office at five to pick up her daughter. 
 So what is he doing in those two-and-a-half hours? 
 He's not with her if she's picking up her daughter. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Then I thought it could be Anna. 
 I know. 
 It's... 
 It's just a feeling. 
 Are you drinking more coffee than usual? 
 No. 
 You're acting like you're drinking more coffee than you should. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm fine. 
 Crisis over. 
 Good. 
 I Googled rashes. 
 And as you can see, skin irritations can look very different, but none of them anything like what I've got. 
 I only gave you the cream yesterday. 
 It doesn't work. 
 Well, you're supposed to allow a week. 
 OK, but if it's going to have an effect in a week, I should see some improvement by now and there's nothing. 
 I've also stopped using the washing powder, as you advised, but there's no evidence so far from that... 
 Ah... 
 You'll have to leave. I'm afraid I'm not feeling very well. 
 But you're a doctor. 
 Ironic. 
 What is it? What's wrong with you? 
 I'm running a temperature and I feel quite sick and... 
 To be honest, I've got a suspicion that, whatever it is, it's probably contagious. 
 I've got to head off. Problem with Tom at school. 
 I'll catch up on paperwork at home. 
 Can you call the last few and reallocate or put them off? 
 No problem. 
 Oh, are you leaving? I wanted to see you. 
 It's urgent. 
 Then you need to call first thing. 
 The not-sleeping is medical. I've got back pain. 
 Tried paracetamol? 
 I have, but I need something stronger. 
 How about a benzodiazepine? 
 That sound like the right sort of thing? 
 I don't know. Erm... yeah. 
 What's the... 
 It's a muscle relaxant. 
 It's essentially a sleeping pill. 
 You didn't mention this back pain yesterday, Carly. 
 I think you've been on the internet. 
 Why do you really need the pills? 
 I can't... sleep. 
 You can tell me anything at all. You know that. 
 Sometimes you just need to talk. 
 OK? 
 Book an appointment when you're ready to trust me. 
 'Hello?' 
 Anna, it's me. Hi. 
 'Hey...' 
 Look, I don't know if you're around or... what you're doing at the moment, but Tom needs picking up from school. I'm stuck at work. 
 'You mean this afternoon?' 
 Yeah. 
 'I'm sure I can.' 
 'What time, exactly?' 
 Er, half past. 
 'Just outside the front?' 
 Yeah. 
 'No problem. I'll take him to mine.' 
 You're a star. 
 'I'll see you later.' 
 Yeah. 
 'Bye.' 
 Bye, then. Bye. 
 ( Banging on car window ) 
 You want me gone. 
 I'm not getting into it now. 
 Why not? 
 Because... 
 Because we're talking through a car window. 
 Look, we're due to have a meeting... 
 I saved someone's life last night in the pub. 
 This young man was in pain. 
 I examined him. 
 He had appendicitis. 
 He's alive because of me. 
 Well, I'm pleased to hear it. 
 I'm still a doctor. 
 sh1t...! 
 What? 
 Gemma! 
 Gemma! 
 Oh...! 
 OK, no. 
 For Janet? 
 Hi, Helen. 
 I didn't know you were here. 
 Just arrived. 
 All right? 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 How are you? 
 Not a good night, was it, Mum? 
 I'll speak to Dr Barton and maybe we can make you more comfortable. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm sorry, Helen. I don't mean to be rude. 
 But would you just give us a minute? 
 I need to check something. 
 I must be in trouble. 
 Shouldn't you be picking up Tom? 
 Anna's doing it. 
 Why? What's the matter? 
 Oh... 
 The thing is you don't get home till half seven and Becky says that she locks up at five. 
 So I couldn't work out what you were doing for two-and-half hours each day. 
 What I was doing? 
 So I followed you. 
 I come here. That's what I do. 
 Every day? 
 Most days at the moment, yeah. 
 Last couple of months, she's worse, so... 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 It's not a secret. 
 Yeah, but you never mentioned it. 
 OK. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You followed me? 
 What did you think I was doing? 
 Is everything all right? 
 I just got worried. 
 I... 
 It doesn't matter. We should... 
 All sorted out? 
 Yeah, absolutely. I've got to head off. 
 All right. 
 Got to pick Tom up. 
 
 
 
 Are you all right? 
 Does everyone have to sign in and out here? 
 Absolutely. 
 Fire regulation. We got pulled up on it last year. 
 You done it? 
 Yep. 
 Yes. 
 I'm... 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, nightmare! 
 He's such an idiot. 
 Thanks, Dennis. 
 Sorry. 
 ( Door opens ) 
 Oh... Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I was looking for, erm, Simon's schedule. 
 I couldn't find it anywhere. 
 Sorry. 
 Is... this his bag? 
 It's mine. 
 Yours? 
 Sorry... 
 I only came back because I left some notes. 
 Dennis let me in. 
 I pick up Isobel and Simon... 
 Well, he's normally gone by five, so... 
 To be honest, that's what I was counting on. 
 We haven't been away in ages as a family and... I thought I could book a surprise holiday, but I need his schedule to know when he's free. 
 So that's why I'm sneaking around. 
 I didn't want him to find out. 
 That's really nice. 
 Well... 
 Well, I'll tell you what. I'll go through and e-mail you some weeks that might work. Is that OK? 
 Perfect. 
 Just saves you going through the whole thing. 
 And I assume you'd rather I didn't mention it? 
 Is that OK? 
 I'd love to open a restaurant one day. 
 We'd serve just two things, but do them really well, like... lamb and carrots. 
 Dad, that's a really bad idea. 
 Why? 
 Well, what if you didn't like lamb or carrots? 
 Well, then you don't come. 
 What's this place called? 
 Ciao. 
 And it's owned by a patient? 
 Yes, er, Susie Parks. 
 She's nice and I didn't think I could... 
 Susie Parks? 
 Yeah. 
 Her husband is Chris Parks? 
 Yes. Yes, I think so. 
 Erm, Chris Parks, he's... 
 I've told you about him. He's given me advice, helped me out. 
 Right, well, this is their new place, opening tonight. 
 Amazing! 
 I'm sorry. 
 What for? 
 I know I'm, er... working long hours at the moment, away a lot, but I really appreciate you supporting me. 
 And once this project's up and running, I promise, it'll be worth it. 
 Are you coming?! 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Come on, we're late. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 We only just made the connection! 
 Me, too! I mean, Foster and Foster. 
 I really should've worked that one out. 
 Ah, Gemma, this is my husband Chris. 
 Chris this is THE Dr Foster. 
 Susie's told me everything you've done. Thank you so much. 
 Oh, well... 
 This is Ros Mahendra, my colleague. 
 Oh, yes, I've seen you a couple of times. 
 And Tom. 
 Hi. 
 Make sure you stay for pudding. Chocolate cake's to die for! 
 Did you make it yourself, Susie? 
 Well, you know, I might've helped with the recipe... 
 You've worked wonders with this place. 
 Yeah, well, we want that family feel. 
 Obviously it's not our first one -- we've got five of these now -- but, you know, it's where we live, it's our home, so it's important it has that personal touch. 
 I mean, we're all mucking in. 
 I'm working out front, Susie's keeping an eye on the kitchen. 
 As best as I can! 
 And this is our youngest, Andrew, who's serving food. 
 And Kate's about somewhere. 
 Er, Kate! 
 Child labour. 
 I thoroughly approve! 
 Absolutely! 
 You should all come tomorrow, so we can return the favour. 
 Tomorrow? 
 Simon's 40th. Tomorrow evening at The Artichoke. 
 You're 40? 
 Unfortunately. 
 Well, we'd love to! 
 Absolutely. Why not? We'll be there. 
 Anyway, listen, I got to, er... 
 Have a great evening. I'll see you. 
 So good to see you. 
 Thanks, Susie. You, too. 
 I love this place. 
 You're a sweetheart. 
 Bye. 
 This used to be a pub. 
 And it was nasty. 
 What was it? The Honey... 
 The Beehive. 
 The Beehive! 
 That was the only place you could get served if you were underage. 
 The landlord didn't care. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey! 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah, fine. Thanks. 
 What's all this? 
 Er, new restaurant. 
 You work at The Crown? 
 Yeah. 
 You look stressed, mate. 
 Want one? 
 No, haven't for years. 
 Used to, though? 
 My husband helped me stop. 
 Won't kill you. 
 Not entirely true. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 ( Men shout drunkenly ) 
 That's Daniel. 
 My boyfriend. 
 He's got a new job. 
 Celebrating. 
 And, yes, he's a twat. 
 Not a bad one, as they go. 
 Are you all right? 
 Sometimes you just need to talk. 
 I'm pretty sure my husband is sleeping with someone else. 
 Oh... Why? Have you seen him out with her? 
 No. 
 Well, found e-mails or whatever? 
 No. 
 Only because you better be sure before you say something. 
 My mate Bromley threw her boyfriend out because he lied about where he was one afternoon. 
 Only thing was, he was shopping for her birthday present. 
 Two weeks later, they split up. 
 Couldn't trust each other after that. 
 Are you going back in? 
 Yeah. 
 Then you'll want one of these. 
 And some of this. 
 Oh, God... 
 Thanks. 
 No worries. 
 Where the f*ck have you been? 
 On my break! 
 Not with me. I'm right here. 
 Yeah, I need to work now, so... 
 We'll have the same again. 
 Tell me at the bar! 
 Goodnight, mate. 
 Night. 
 Hey, sleep well. 
 Already asleep. 
 Dream good, then. 
 Love you, Tom. 
 Love you, too. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 'Is it my love? Ask again that question. Speak again in that soft voice. And look again with wishes in thy eyes. Oh, no. Thou can'st not. Can'st thou forgive me, then? Wilt thou believe so kindly of my fault, to call it madness? Oh, give that madness yet a milder name. And call it passion. Then be still more kind and call that passion... love.' 
 ( Knocking on door ) 
 Is everything OK? 
 Yes, erm... 
 It's nothing to worry about. 
 I know we called, said it was urgent, but... it's because I wanted to speak to you this morning. 
 No, I meant you. Your eyes are red. 
 Are you still having difficulty sleeping? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I'm going to give you the pills that you've asked for. 
 Only a few. See if it helps. 
 Oh... 
 But I... need something in return. 
 A favour. 
 ( Mobile phone rings ) 
 ( Patient clears his throat ) 
 Er, I'm sorry... 
 ( Mobile beeps ) 
 I assume you'll lead? 
 Sure. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Jack, come in, please. 
 Would you take a seat? 
 Enjoying this? 
 Of course not. 
 Why do you need three of you? 
 We're the partners in the practice. It's standard procedure. 
 Who makes the decisions? 
 We all do. 
 But who do I talk to? 
 Jack, you know full well, I'm senior partner. 
 I've been a family doctor 35 years. 
 I am respected in this town. 
 Of course... 
 And I have seen this place change from a practice where the doctors knew the patients and had time to look after them, to an institution where it's just about efficiency, management. 
 We are supposed to work to the maxim, "first, do no harm." 
 Well, let me tell you, harm has most certainly been done! 
 Can I interrupt? 
 No! You wait. 
 I have a question. 
 I've told you, I'm going to speak. 
 Have you been drinking today? 
 What? 
 Because I can smell it. 
 Well... don't see why I shouldn't. 
 I'm not at work. 
 Look, the fact is I disagree with the way things are run. 
 No. 
 What? 
 You don't disagree with the way things are run. 
 You disagree with me. 
 You're offended because I'm a 37-year-old woman, not from round here, good at my job and when our former senior partner retired, he chose me rather than you to take over. 
 Shall we stick to the procedure? 
 You don't like me. 
 That's right. 
 But it's not because you're a woman or from somewhere else. 
 When you arrived, I was... 
 I was happy to give you a chance. 
 But I've gone off you, Gemma, because it's all gone to your head. 
 You think you're so clever. 
 We have to let you go. 
 No sh1t? 
 You've had three formal warnings. 
 I'll tell you what happens to arrogant people. 
 You are suspended immediately, pending... 
 They end up alone! 
 All right, let's just calm down. 
 Yes, it's all right. I've got the idea. 
 Jack... 
 ( Jack slams the door ) 
 Never seen you like that. 
 ( Mobile phone buzzes ) 
 Excuse me. 
 Yes? 
 He was in there half an hour with the curtains closed. 
 I... 
 'And now they've both come out. He's saying goodbye.' 
 Get a picture. 
 I'm too far away. They're... 
 They're kissing. 
 'Are you still there?' 
 What does she look like? 
 'Your height. Blonde. She's getting in her car. He's gone to his.' 
 How old? 
 I can't see. 
 'Take a picture.' 
 I can't. 
 You can! Take a picture. 
 Take a picture of anything. 
 OK. OK. OK. 
 I'm going to do the minutes now. 
 I wasn't sure if we'd finished. 
 Yes, I think so. 
 OK. 
 ( Mobile phone buzzes ) 
 Yes? 
 'It was all I could get. Sorry. Looks like you were right.' 
 You want to know who it is? 
 What? 
 I can find out. 
 You go inside, love. I... 
 I just need to speak to my friend. 
 And don't forget the cake. It's on the table. 
 Well? 
 I've got a mate down the pub. 
 He's a desk sergeant, so he can do the number plate. 
 Erm... 
 Susan... Parks. 
 What? 
 You know who that is? 
 What are you going to do? 
 It doesn't make sense... 
 Here... Seven, for now. See how you go. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 I assume that he wakes you up? 
 Look, I come back from work and every night he is rowdy and up until the early morning. 
 If I can get in and go straight to sleep... it makes it easier. 
 You don't have to stay with him. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Carly... show me. 
 Did he do this? 
 Carly? 
 Last night. Yeah. 
 He just... He won't leave me alone. 
 No, wait! I need that! 
 Where is he? 
 I thought we were going to the party. 
 I need to do something first. 
 We'll be late! 
 Can't be helped. Number 7? 
 What are you going to do? 
 Have a word. 
 You don't know him. 
 It's your house. You want him to leave? 
 Right, then. 
 ( Mobile phone buzzes ) 
 What's his full name? 
 Daniel Spencer. 
 Any problems, drive away. Take Tom, call the police. 
 I'll be back in a minute. 
 Mum! 
 What are you doing? 
 House call. 
 ( Shooting and shouting from tv game ) 
 ( Doorbell rings ) 
 Daniel Spencer? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm your doctor. 
 No, you're not. 
 I'm the senior partner, so I have overall responsibility. 
 Could I come in? 
 Is this normal, doctors calling round randomly? 
 Not at all. Perhaps you'd like to sit down? 
 Why? 
 I think you should. 
 You know what medical records are? 
 What? 
 We record every conversation that you have with your doctor and it stays on file. 
 They can be extremely revealing. 
 How's the new job? 
 Responsibility? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Occasionally, these records get leaked and the wrong people get their hands on them. 
 Employers, for instance. 
 And they're full of the sorts of things that you wouldn't want people knowing. 
 History of drug use, mental instability... 
 I'm having one of these, OK? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Dr Gemma Foster, head of Parminster Medical Practice. 
 Just let me finish. 
 I've seen Carly's arm. 
 Accident. 
 It's a very deep bruise. 
 You're going to leave and get out of her house. 
 None of your f*cking business! 
 You should get help. 
 Come and see me, if you like. That's up to you. 
 But if, once you've left, you go near her, if she even sees you again, your employers will receive a copy of your medical records... and if they don't contain anything compromising already, I will ensure that they are altered. 
 Drug problems, injuries suggesting a history of violence. 
 I'll go to the police and I'll mention what I saw on your girlfriend's arm and this new career of yours will stop very suddenly. 
 They won't believe you. 
 I'm a doctor with ten years' experience. 
 I'm a senior manager, a school governor and in this town, Daniel, people take me at my word. 
 You f*cking bitch! 
 Argh! 
 You think it's OK to call women words like that? 
 It is not. 
 Daniel... she'll send your things. Leave now. 
 He'll come back. 
 Doubt it. 
 If he does, give me a call. I'll set the police on him. 
 About the other thing. Your thing. 
 What? 
 You said you looked everywhere and never found anything. 
 Well, when I saw... 
 What I saw earlier... he kept on going to his boot in the car. 
 So, maybe, if you want to know what's been going on, look there. 
 Here, love, give it to me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Where've you been? What? 
 What? 
 Could you give this to Anna. 
 Right. Sorry. I just thought you'd be here. 
 Have you got the keys to your car? I'm missing an earring. 
 What? Why do you need... 
 I've searched everywhere else. 
 You look fine. 
 I know it's in there. I need it. 
 OK. Just... come quickly, yeah? 
 Here we are. Everyone, out. 
 Right, come on. Come on, everyone. 
 Best behaviour, please. 
 Right, daughter, too. Shall we? 
 Susie, hi. 
 ( She sighs deeply ) 
 Oh...! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Where have you been? 
 You all right? 
 sh1t! 
 Ow! 
 Ow! 
 I'm an idiot. Sorry. 
 I'm going to have to take this off. 
 Ow...! 
 Ah! 
 There. 
 Maybe I'll leave the food to Neil. 
 You all right? 
 Mate, if you've finished in the sick bay, we need your attention over here for two seconds. 
 Come on, best smile! 
 ( Cheering ) 
 Thanks, guys! 
 Wow! 
 All : Ooooh...! 
 All : Yay! 
 ( Applause ) 
 Speech! 
 40! Jesus! 
 Er... 
 I would say thanks for coming, but there's free booze, so I know why you're here. 
 Especially you! 
 Erm... 
 I'm not really into speeches but... I have to thank two people. 
 I at least want to do that. 
 Erm... 
 Firstly, Tom. 
 He's smart, he's well-behaved, most of the time... but better than that, and he won't like me saying this, but... he's kind. 
 He always wants people to be happy and he does his best to make that happen. 
 Sorry, Tom. I'm embarrassing you, I know, but... I'm really so proud to be your dad. 
 Ah... 
 And the other person... 
 You'll know that I've lived most of my life here, apart from five years in London, which I hated! 
 But even so, I'm glad I went because in London... I found Gemma. 
 And since then, I've never looked back. 
 I'd be nothing without her. She's... a wonderful mother, a talented doctor and not a bad little earner! 
 Erm... 
 All my dreams, what I want, she never laughs, she just asks how she can help. 
 And in return, she's stuck with a middle-aged man. 
 So... in sympathy and... admiration, please, be upstanding for a toast to Gemma! 
 All : To Gemma! 
 Come on, Gemma. Speech! 
 Speech! 
 Right, let's get this party started! 
 'Hell... Hell... Yet I'll be calm. Now the dawn begins... and the slow hand of fate is stretched to draw the veil and leave thee bare. Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turn'd... Nor hell a fury like the woman scorned.' 
 How long have you known? 
 Oh, God, Gemma... 
 Yeah. 
 I want him to come in and see those suitcases and understand, in that second, exactly what he's lost.
