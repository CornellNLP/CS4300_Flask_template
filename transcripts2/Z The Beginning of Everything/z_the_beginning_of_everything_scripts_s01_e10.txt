 It's "under cover." 
 What? 
 "He was always under cover," not "under covers." 
 She had a lover, and he was always under covers. 
 That makes sense. 
 Right. Well, I guess you'd know more about that sort of thing than I would. 
 It's just a song, Zelda. 
 Here, darling. 
 Why don't you see if you can find a road that'll take us to Richmond? 
 Uh, it says "Jog left at Vagabond Lane." 
 What do you think they mean by jog? 
 Well, I think that means to step on the gas and then scoot around... 
 Slow down, Scott. 
 I want to get to Montgomery in one piece. 
 All right, then. 
 No jog. 
 How long are we going to be in Montgomery for? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, it's just that I promised Max Perkins... 
 You didn't have to come. 
 I've been thinking. 
 Oh? 
 Maybe I'll go on the wagon for a little while. 
 [scoff] 
 Clear my head. 
 Really? 
 You don't think I can? 
 Hand me that gin bottle in the back there. 
 [shatter] 
 All right, then, uh, I guess I will, too. 
 It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for Mama and Daddy to see us off the bottle for once. 
 I didn't do it for your father. 
 The judge has rendered his verdict. 
 There will be no retrial. 
 Can you blame him? 
 Can't say that I do. 
 Thank you. 
 [horn honks] 
 Man : Congratulations! 
 [honk] 
 So now Sarah Bernhardt's writing novels. 
 The actress? She's still alive? 
 She's 75 years old. 
 Huh. 
 "The famous actress has already dabbled in painting and sculpture. This is her first excursion to literature. She has said and declared that if it is successful, she'll attempt a play." 
 Well, good for her. 
 Huh. 
 What? 
 Uch. For God's sake, she's an actress. 
 At 75 years old, maybe she doesn't care as much as you do. 
 Maybe not. 
 Maybe that's your problem. 
 What, that I care? 
 No. That I don't. 
 And I'm sick of talking about it. 
 Zelda : Right or left? 
 I must have taken a wrong turn. 
 I told you we should have turned back at that service station. 
 That's not what Dr. Jones advised. 
 Well, there's a cabin up there. 
 Maybe they can tell us how to get to Fredericksburg. 
 Yeah, I'm not sure that's a good idea. 
 Sure it is. 
 Maybe we should wait until we get to a real town. 
 We haven't seen a real town in miles. 
 Now come on. There are dogs out front. 
 Oh! 
 [gasp] 
 Holy Jesus! 
 Stop! Stop, stop, stop! 
 Stop the car. 
 It's gone. The whole thing is absolutely gone. 
 [gasp] 
 [laughing] I can see that. 
 I guess the expensive doesn't like Virginia. 
 Why are you laughing? This is a problem. 
 You'll have to fix that wheel. 
 We're gonna have to find it first. 
 Them potholes are real bad on tires. 
 That's for sure. 
 Mister, is this what you're looking for? 
 Need a hand? 
 Uh, no. No, it's fine. 
 Where are you going? 
 Home. 
 Where is that? 
 Alabama. 
 Is it far? 
 90 miles from here. 
 Is it nice? 
 It's the most beautiful place on Earth. 
 The air smells like, uh, ripe pears. 
 The nights are warm and soft. 
 And it's old and comfortable now. 
 Everything's old here, too. 
 I don't like it much. 
 I'm going to get to Richmond some day. 
 Don't be in too big a hurry. 
 The world's a big place. 
 This will help you find it. 
 Thank you, lady. 
 How are we doing, fellas? 
 We're all done. Thanks for your help. 
 So which way to Fredericksburg? 
 About 15 miles on that road. 
 Can't miss it. 
 Great. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, ma'am. 
 You're, uh, you're gonna let her drive? 
 Of course. She's my queen. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, we're going to have to be careful now. 
 You just gave that man our last $5.00. 
 We only have about enough for one more night on the road. 
 What? You didn't tell me we were running out of money. 
 I wouldn't have bought such a big breakfast this morning. 
 I wanted you to have whatever breakfast you wanted, darling. 
 I don't want you to worry. 
 You still could have been honest with me about the money. 
 That's all right. We'll be in Montgomery soon. 
 We can stay in Mama's house. 
 That house is so big. 
 Huh. You can even finish your novel there. 
 [scoff] Right. 
 Whoa. What are you doing? 
 Wait! What are you doing? 
 Saving money. 
 No, no, no, no! 
 [laughing] 
 Christ Almighty, Zelda. 
 You can't break the law! 
 Whoo hoo hoo! 
 We don't want the cops after us. 
 I didn't know I married a regular land stirrer. 
 There's a lot you don't know about me. 
 [clatter] 
 Oh! 
 What was that? 
 Uh... 
 Still alive. 
 [sob] 
 [retching] 
 I didn't see it. 
 What are we going to do? 
 We can't do anything. 
 There must be something. 
 There's nothing. 
 Get in the car. 
 Oh. 
 Zelda, we got to go. 
 It's just a matter of time before the toll booth guy comes looking for us. 
 We can't just leave him here, Scott. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 I'm not God. 
 [sobbing] 
 Zelda, let's go. 
 [engine starts] 
 
 
 
 How could you leave that animal to suffer like that? 
 You're the one that hit it, Zelda. 
 He came out of nowhere. 
 No one could have stopped. 
 I never should have let you drive. 
 Let me drive? 
 You insisted. I indulged. 
 Indulged me. 
 What am I, a child? 
 Why do you get to decide what I do and don't do? 
 We're just talking about a dying animal that we couldn't help, that is all. 
 Yes, it was distressing, but we have to move on. 
 I didn't want to move on. That deer was suffering. 
 Look, you didn't know what you wanted. 
 You were hysterical. 
 Now, I had to do what I thought was right. 
 I had to make a decision for both of us. 
 [scoff] What you thought was right? 
 Like letting Eugenia Bankhead give you the works? 
 Was that right? 
 What? 
 Ah... 
 I was drunk. 
 You're always drunk. 
 Well, I saw you with Townsend. 
 We were just talking. 
 You were in each other's arms. 
 He's been after you ever since he met you. 
 You know that. 
 But we were just talking. 
 It didn't mean anything. 
 Exactly. 
 None of it means anything. 
 Is that the kind of marriage you want to have? 
 No. 
 No, of course not. 
 I just... 
 I got drunk. 
 And I lost myself. 
 I wish we hadn't thrown out that gin. 
 [ding ding ding ding] 
 [ding] 
 Yeah? 
 Good evening. We'd like a room. 
 Where are you folks from? 
 New York City. 
 New York City. 
 We're on our way to Montgomery. 
 Oh, I like your bulldog, Mister. 
 We're sold out tonight. 
 Sold out? 
 But there's clearly no one here. 
 No vacancy. 
 There aren't any motorcars parked outside. 
 We got a dress code here, and she's breaking it. 
 Ah. 
 He doesn't like my knickerbockers. 
 [scoff] 
 Pity a nice girl like you should be let to wear them kind of clothes. 
 And exactly what kind of clothing should a nice girl be wearing, in your opinion, Floyd, seeing as you're clearly a man of sartorial flair? 
 Don't know what you're trying to say, fancy pants. 
 What clothing should my wife be wearing? 
 Scott, let's just go. 
 No. I am tired and hungry, you would like to take a bath, and we would like to get a room. 
 Not my problem. I ain't renting a room to some Yankee bed bunny. Now, I... 
 You calling my wife a... 
 Take your hands off... 
 Hey, Mister, you don't want me wearing these pants in your hotel? 
 How about now? You going to rent us a room now? 
 I'm calling the sheriff. 
 We'd better scram. 
 Go on. 
 Did you see his face? 
 I was too busy looking at your legs, darling. 
 Hurry up. 
 [motor stalling] 
 Uhh. 
 Ah. 
 What's wrong? 
 Slide over. 
 It's dead again. 
 Damn. 
 Release the brake. [grunt] 
 Who bought this rolling piece of junk anyway? 
 We did! 
 Floyd : Hold on! 
 Come on, come on. 
 [hissing] 
 I don't miss New York at all. 
 Not even the people? 
 Especially not the people. 
 I love you, darling. 
 We can't ever let anything or anyone come between us. 
 Sometimes we come between us. 
 Mama. Daddy? 
 Hello! 
 Katie? 
 It's all locked up. 
 They're not home. 
 Well, did they tell you where they were heading? 
 They left rather abruptly, remember? 
 I assumed they were going to take the train back home, but I guess they went back to Tilde's. 
 Scott, what am I going to do? 
 What do you mean? 
 I need to see them. 
 Darling, they... they're not gone forever. 
 You don't understand. I need to see them now. 
 Everything's come undone. 
 Nothing's come undone. 
 We're fine. 
 We're not fine. 
 We have no money, no car, no place to stay, no place for you to write. 
 Where are we supposed to go? We don't have a home! 
 Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 We can go anywhere and do anything we want. 
 If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris. 
 If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you. 
 The world is ours, and I want to see every bit of it with you... as long as we're together, because no matter where we are, we're home. 
 Oh, and I want to be with you anywhere. 
 Me, too. 
 I can write anywhere. 
 I love you best of all. 
 I really need a bath and a nap. 
 Ah, well... we could break a window. 
 Oh, if you think my daddy hates you now... 
 I know where we can go. 
 Come on. 
 They have guest rooms upstairs for members. 
 It won't be the Biltmore, but... 
 Zelda. 
 Zelda Sayre. 
 Ohh! 
 John. Ellie. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 Oh, Zelda. 
 When did you get back? 
 Look at your hair. 
 Heavens, Zelda, what are you doing here? 
 I thought your parents went up to see you. 
 They did, but, uh... oh, it's a long story. 
 I read your book. 
 We all have. 
 It caused quite a stir around here. 
 And everywhere. 
 Oh, good. That was my intention. 
 I should, uh, go see about the room, darling. 
 Zelda, you're famous. 
 We've been following you in all the papers. 
 And you're married. 
 Yes, I am. 
 What's it like? 
 There's a lot of drinking involved. 
 But not now. 
 We're off it now. 
 Oh, come on, Zelda, for real. 
 [sigh] It feels like I haven't been back here in ages. 
 Tell me about you. And Montgomery. 
 And Livye. 
 Oh, Livye's dating Stuart Ramsey. 
 Oh, no one knows why. He's a mailman. 
 He's nice to her. 
 Oh, but listen to this. 
 Buddy Hollingsworth and Nita McCormick were caught kissing at a picture show last... 
 Zelda, narrating : It's a funny thing coming home. 
 Nothing changes. 
 Everything looks the same, feels the same, even smells the same. 
 You realize what's changed... is you. 
 Zelda, are you back for the ball? 
 Oh, uh, I don't know. 
 We just needed a place to stay. 
 Actually, uh, I need to freshen up. 
 Can you tell Scott I'll be right back? 
 Sure, sure. 
 Excuse me. 
 [retching] 
 [flush] 
 Are you sick, honey? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Oh. My goodness. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 I had the same thing with all of my babies. 
 Ginger tea, plain crackers. 
 Works every time. 
 Your mother must be so thrilled.
