 ["Toot-toot-tootsie"] 
 Zelda. 
 I thought I'd be able to see the city by now. 
 We've got miles and miles and miles. 
 [sigh] 
 Who can sit? 
 Sticking your head out the window isn't going to get us there any faster. 
 It might. 
 Besides, New York needs to see me coming. 
 Honestly. 
 Isn't there room at the church for this? 
 Then Tilde could help. 
 Where's your sense of adventure? 
 I don't want to ruin my hair. 
 Scott's corsage. 
 [sigh] 
 Let's see it. 
 Zelda, there's something we need to discuss, something Mama explained to me before my wedding night and I had to explain to Tilde. 
 Oh? 
 About your... 
 About your conjugal duties. 
 My what? 
 Baby, every man has his own set of expectations, but it's better to perform them in the dark. 
 The darker, the better. 
 Not that there's any need to worry. 
 He'll take the lead, of course, but it's important for a wife not to... hesitate. 
 So when your husband is... ready to... proceed, you just lie back and think of the magnolias in our garden. 
 It works every time. 
 Thank you, Tootsie. 
 I'll do just that. 
 It's gorgeous. 
 It's much better. Thank you. 
 Where are they all going? 
 Tootsie. 
 Where is he? 
 [gasp] Hi. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Sorry. Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Scott! 
 Both : Mmm. 
 I can't believe you're actually here. 
 I've lost count of the months. Are you real? 
 I'm real. 
 I can marry you right now right here. 
 Don't you dare. You promised me a church wedding. 
 Oh, don't worry. I've arranged for everything. 
 You ready? 
 Tootsie, come on. 
 I think I accosted 70-odd ladies looking for you. 
 Scott Fitzgerald, are you saying there's 70 ladies like me? 
 I would never say such a thing. 
 There's only one sun... you... center of everything. 
 Where's he taking our bags? 
 Thank you. 
 To the Biltmore. 
 I've booked us all rooms. 
 The Biltmore? Really? 
 Our new home.

 Zelda. 
 It just goes on forever, everywhere you look. 
 There's plenty of time for that later.

 [whisper] Zelda, my goodness. 
 I told you he'd do something magnificent. 
 Zelda, this is Ludlow Fowler, my best man. 
 Welcome, Zelda. 
 Oh. 
 Now this is how you arrive in New York City. 
 Well done. 
 Thank you. 
 This is Harold Ober, my agent. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 He's the man that helps make the money. 
 And his wife Anne. 
 Pleasure to meet you, dear. 
 You, too. 
 3,000 copies sold in three days. 
 How's that for a wedding present? 
 Is this all for us? 
 Uh, no. 
 This is for the Easter Mass tomorrow. 
 We're in the rectory, darling. 
 Oh. 
 The rectory? 
 What about Tilde? She's not here. 
 We have to wait. 
 I... I bought you all we can. 
 Mr. Fitzgerald, are we ready? 
 Uh, there's one more family member. 
 Uh, as I mentioned, I have the O'Reilly service this afternoon. 
 [sigh] We're ready. We're ready. 
 Uh, Tilde will understand. 
 If you'll follow me. 
 Okay. 
 Ahem. 
 Now... 
 Here? Really? 
 Gosh. 
 From Mama's wedding dress. 
 Something borrowed, so you can have one Sayre with you. 
 Tootsie. 
 I love you, baby sister. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Priest : Ahem. 
 Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love. 
 Do you have the ring? 
 Oh. 
 Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? 
 I do. 
 Zelda Sayre, do you take Francis Scott Fitzgerald for your lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? 
 I do. 
 May the Lord bless and consecrate Scott and Zelda in their love for one another. 
 I now pronounce you man and wife. 
 I adore you. 
 You be a good Catholic, Scott, and you be a good Episcopalian, Zelda, and everything will be fine. 
 Zelda : Tilde! 
 Tootsie : Tilde. 
 We did it. 
 Oh. So glad you're here. 
 You're married? But it's not even noon. 
 We should have taken a cab. I told you we'd be late. 
 We're not late. It's quarter till. 
 The wedding was supposed to start at noon. 
 How could you let this happen? 
 Uh, the preacher started. 
 You couldn't wait? 
 Tilde, this is how the moderns do it. 
 We don't wait for anything. 
 Yes. Now's the fun part.

 Here we are. 
 Welcome to your new life. 
 [gasp] 
 Wow. 
 Is there more than one room? 
 It's a honeymoon suite. 
 Oh, my. 
 Now you can see what the rich spend their money on. 
 And it's all ours. 
 Ah, silk sheets. 
 This is gorgeous. 
 Anything your heart desires. 
 Just press this, and you'll have it. 
 Anything? 
 Anything that wild mind of yours can conceive of. 
 And a bellboy can carry. 
 This is the Biltmore, after all. 
 There's no reason for us to ever leave this room. 
 Oh, good, because I don't want to. 
 [knock on door] 
 Did we order something already? 
 I invited a few friends to celebrate with us. 
 Oh. 
 Well, of course. 
 How crude we'd be if we didn't.

 Man : Hey-hey! 
 Man : Congratulations. 
 ♪♪ [jazz] 
 Man : Congratulations, both of you. 
 That's sweet of y'all. 
 Ah. Winston. 
 Fitzgerald. 
 This is Winston. 
 Hi. Lovely to meet you. 
 And Reed. 
 Mrs. Fitzgerald. 
 Boys, I am never going to remember all your names, so you're just going to have to be fine with that. 
 Well, I am the handsome one, and he's the reprobate. 
 Or vice versa. 
 This is Townsend Martin. 
 He's the one that writes scenarios for the pictures. 
 Really? 
 I'll remember him well. 
 Townsend, even a bride on her wedding day? 
 Oh. 
 There. 
 That's the groom. 
 That's enough. 
 ♪♪ 
 A chorus girl? 
 And a fetching one at that. 
 I dare say Scott was the prettiest chorus girl the Triangle Club has ever had. 
 [laughter] 
 Prettier than I am? 
 I was as pretty as you are, and you're as handsome as me. 
 We're two of a kind. 
 Yes, although only one of you was propositioned by a pair of Princeton linemen. 
 Scott : That is too unfortunate. 
 Scott. Scott. 
 Might have been a little bit embarrassing... 
 Are there any plans for a meal? 
 A meal? 
 Something to absorb some of this liquor. 
 Oh. Oh, yes. 
 Yes. Of course. I'm starving. 
 Food, sustenance, a must. 
 Here. You can order... 
 [buzzing] 
 ...whatever you like. 
 Order everything there is, why don't you?

 Where is my little Zelda Sayre? 
 Oh, Zelda, there you are, darling. 
 Tallulah! 
 Eugenia. 
 You can hear the Montgomery from across the room. 
 What a surprise. 
 Surprise? Townsend told us about this shindig. 
 Thought you might like to see some faces from home. 
 Now where is that wunderkind husband of yours? 
 ♪♪ 
 Dear Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm not much of a reader. 
 I usually just skip to my lines. 
 But I say let's drink to your brilliant book. 
 Hear, hear. 
 [whisper] Save me. 
 My apologies on behalf of the Princeton crew. 
 We're a bit much, taken all at once. 
 Or individually. 
 I've never seen him like this about anybody, you know? 
 Hope you're ready. 
 Because you two are off to the races. 
 Does anybody call you Luddy? 
 No. 
 Then I will. 
 A-a-ahem! I have a toast. 
 I have a toast, everyone. 
 To the incredible... incorrigible... intellectual... 
 Intellectual? Good God! 
 Inebriated. 
 [laughter] 
 Irascible F. Scott Fitzgerald and his beautiful bride. 
 To Scott. 
 To Scott! 
 And his bride. 
 His bride! 
 [applause, cheering] 
 To Zelda. 
 Tilde. 
 Wait, Tilde. 
 Tilde! 
 You're not leaving already. 
 The lobster creams just come up. 
 No, no. I've had quite enough. 
 I blame you for this. 
 And I don't think I'll ever forgive you. 
 Oh, sure you will. 
 Tilde. 
 Tilde, stop. 
 Tilde. 
 Why are you leaving? 
 Because I'm heartbroken, Zelda. 
 You couldn't wait for your sister. 
 It's only Tootsie and me, and you let Scott... 
 And I don't want to hear how modern it all is. 
 A wedding should be about tradition and family. 
 There wasn't a proper reception or a photographer. 
 What's Mama going to put on her wall? 
 Zelda, that can't be what you wanted, what you dreamed of. 
 Yes, it is. 
 This is New York. 
 Yes. And you just got here. 
 This was your wedding day. 
 It was supposed to be about you, not Scott. 
 It is about me. 
 And Scott loves me. 
 He did all this for me. 
 This is exactly what I want. 
 If I had wanted a stiff, boring old party, I would never have left Montgomery. 
 Perhaps you shouldn't have. 
 This is my life, Tilde, and I'm gonna love every minute of it. 
 Maybe we should... 
 Can't save somebody who doesn't want to be saved. 
 Katie, that can certainly wait until tomorrow. 
 I suppose it could. 
 [sigh] For better or worse, our girl's a married woman by now. 
 Mm-hmm. Well, the judge say Montgomery never seen no Catholic wedding anyhow, so this will be fine. 
 [phone rings] 
 I'll get it, Katie. 
 [ring] 
 Hello. 
 Zelda : Mama? 
 Oh, baby girl! 
 I'm married, Mama. 
 So you are. 
 It's... Tell me everything, my girl. 
 Well, Montgomery's never seen the likes of St. Patrick's Cathedral. I can tell you that. 
 And I looked right smart in my spring suit with your lace as the crowning effect. 
 There were flowers to the rafters, Mama, so fragrant and lush. 
 Why, every florist in the city must have sold out. 
 Scott thought of every last detail. 
 Our honeymoon suite's on the 18th floor. 
 Oh. 
 Can you believe a building could be so high? 
 And his best man made the most beautiful speech. 
 Scott's friends are such a hoot. 
 We've been dancing for hours. 
 Oh. What a glorious day. 
 How's Daddy? 
 Oh... he's just fine. 
 Are you happy, baby? 
 Of course I'm happy, Mama. 
 Well, I don't want to keep you from your husband, then. 
 I love you, Mama. 
 Give my love to Katie and Daddy. 
 Be good, Zelda. 
 ♪♪ [jazz] 
 Hey, y'all, it's getting late. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Where's Scott? 
 Scott. Scott... 
 [chatter] 
 [laughter, chatter] 
 [music stops] 
 If y'all don't mind, I'd like to have my new husband to myself now. 
 [whispering, murmuring] 
 I couldn't wait one second more. 
 I was made for you, Scott. 
 Like you had me ordered, made, and measured just for you. 
 And I want you to wear me. 
 [giggling] 
 "It seemed strange that out of a row of Union soldiers, two or three made him think of dead loves and dead lovers, when they were exactly like the rest, even to the yellowish moss." 
 Those are my words from my letter. 
 Scott, you used my words? 
 Oh, well... 
 You made me a part of your wonderful book for the whole world to read? 
 Ohh. 
 You really did it. 
 [chuckling] 
 We did it. 
 There'll never be just two of us again. 
 From now on, we'll be three: you, me, and us.
