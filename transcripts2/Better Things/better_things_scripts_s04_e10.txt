 [LAUGHTER] 
 How did you come to write The Feminine Mystique? 
 I thought there was something wrong with me because I didn't have an orgasm waxing the kitchen floor. 
 [LAUGHING] [AUDIENCE CLAPS] 
 SAM: Okay, and, uh, tell us your story. 
 The first time I got my period, I was watching A Clockwork Orange with my brother and his friends. 
 Ugh, opening night of my first show in high school. 
 14 years old. 
 I think I was 13. Fourteen. 
 January 13, 1976-- first day I bled. 
 Shame. My mom never spoke to me about it. 
 "Menu-strating." And I'm like, "Mena-what?" 
 It makes you feel alive, and it makes you feel young. 
 "We're going to red China. Do you need a bomber?" 
 "No, I need a flat ship." 
 I'm gonna be, like, 75 with my best friends that I've known for, like, 45 years going, "Oh, does anyone have a tampon?" 
 And they're just gonna roll their eyes. 
 But I really wasn't too... too sure what was happening, but yeah, specifically, Clockwork Orange is vivid in my memory. 
 It sucks to have a period, it sucks to have a baby, it sucks to have menopause. 
 If I could go back and do it again, I think I would've been a boy. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [FIREWORKS POPPING] 
 [CROWD CLAMORING, GASPING] Whoa! [LAUGHS] 
 [CHEERING] 
 SAM: Let's get up. 
 Get up. Get up. Okay. 
 Keep going, keep going. Hold hands. 
 Yes! We made it out! 
 Yes. We made it out, we made it out. 
 Beat the crowd. Beat the crowd. Beat the crowd. 
 No, no, no. Oh, God. 
 Mom, can I get another hot dog? 
 Guess not. Everything's closed. 
 Shitfire. 
 Nice mouth. 
 Okay. This fun? 
 Mom, I'm not getting... What? Oh. 
 Mom, look at me. Okay. 
 I'm not getting onto an elevator like sardines. 
 I can't. No. No, no, no. 
 Too claustro. 
 I'm not... I'm not kidding. Damn it! Come on. 
 Wait. Be careful. 
 Oof. 
 Hug the wall. 
 Duke! Stay together. 
 Ow. 
 [CHEERING, WHOOPING, CLAPPING] 
 I have to go to the bathroom. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 You good? Jesus, did you have, like, ten beers? 
 God. 
 Good job. 
 All right. 
 Pull your pants up. Let's go. 
 Come on. Come-come on. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [SIGHS] 
 You know what, come here. 
 Hi. Hi. Hi. Excuse me. 
 What's the holdup? 
 We can't seem to get out of here. [CHUCKLES] 
 Well, the president's downtown, so, traffic's backed for miles. 
 This could be hours before it clears. 
 Oh. Awesome. 
 I know who you are. Mm. 
 You're the lady from Communion Corporation. 
 Oh, actually, no, that's not me. That's Constance Zimmer. 
 Yeah? Another actor. Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. I mean, she's great. 
 Yeah, she's great. She was in Sole de la Luna. 
 And she was the voice of the dog in pen1s Envy. 
 Thanks, Murray. I knew I knew you from something. 
 God, you were so good in that. Hmm. 
 ¿Hablas español, sí? Sí, un poquito. 
 Que bueno. [CHUCKLES] 
 Can we take a picture, you know, for my wife? 
 Oh. Oh. Oh, of course. I'll take it. 
 Okay... 
 [SHUTTER CLICKING] 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 GUARD: Damn. Your mom is so funny. 
 You're lucky. Mm. 
 You must laugh all the time. 
 [MURRAY GIGGLES] SAM: Well, he does 
 'cause I'm not his mom. 
 Hmm. She hates me. 
 Cool. You know, I'm done for the night. 
 I can get you guys out of here and take you to the train station. 
 Oh, um... that's, um... 
 Yeah. I understand. 
 At least let me walk you out of here. 
 I can get you to a better place to catch a cab. 
 Okay. 
 That'd be good. Thank you. 
 [QUIETLY] What are doing? We don't know... It's fine. Come on. 
 We got to get out of here. [SPUTTERS] 
 Mom, how much further? 
 My feet hurt. I'm hungry. 
 It's just up there. 
 I don't mind the walk. 
 [CHUCKLES] I'm kind of used to it now. 
 It's 'cause they don't give the staff parking spots, so we got to find parking where we can. 
 Then the club just pays for our tickets. 
 [ROOSTER CROWING] [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] 
 Listen to the roosters. 
 Yeah. 
 [SIGHS] 
 That's the one they put here this morning, and, uh, this is a new one. 
 So, you guys want a ride out of here or... 
 Yeah, um... just go. 
 Murray, go. 
 Duke, take him over to the side of the... 
 Yeah, do you...? 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Do you mind if we call your wife really quickly? 
 No offense. I just, you know... 
 Por supuesto. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 [HONKING] 
 FORTUNATO: Hola, mi amor. 
 ¿Mi amor? Estupido. 
 Come on, coño. Mi amor, bullshit. 
 Hey. Hey, you're working late tonight. 
 Oh, hey. Hi. 
 Oh. Oh, didn't know you had company. 
 Anything else going on this weekend? 
 Trabajo, trabajo, trabajo. 
 Eso. Good guy. Good guy. 
 Well, get these kids home safe. 
 Bye, kiddos. All right. [TAPS ON CAR] 
 Have a good night. Adios. 
 WOMAN: Bye-bye. One out! 
 SAM: Whoa. Isn't this crazy, guys? 
 We got, like, a police escort. 
 We got the moves like Jagger.

 Here you go, love. Thank you. 
 Hi. WOMAN: Hi there. 
 I love your coat. 
 Mm. I love your youth. [CHUCKLES] 
 So you just cruise around L.A. all day and make people food in this? 
 Yup. Damn. 
 This is the perfect job for me. 
 Yeah, I love it. 
 I've worked in kitchens all my life, but there's nothing better than taking great food on the road. 
 Mmm. This is so good. [LAUGHS] 
 It's my mom's recipe. 
 Your mom's? I love it. 
 WOMAN: Well, you seem very smart. 
 And like you know about a lot of things. Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 I can see the future. 
 Really? 
 Is there gonna be a future? 
 Mm-hmm. I never want to get married or have kids. 
 Do I? 
 Get married and have kids? 
 Well, I never did, and I had a really good life. 
 I've known many good men. 
 They gave me music, love, oh, danger... ideas, adventures. 
 It shaped me. 
 But at the end of a day, I prefer being alone. 
 Being alone and being able to feel good with yourself-- that's the ticket. 
 You're beautiful. 
 I-I... 
 I mean, I-I love your hair and your face and-and your clothes. [LAUGHS] 
 And... [SNIFFS] and you smell so good. [LAUGHS] 
 Oh, goodness, well, you... 
 You make me feel very special. 
 [BOTH LAUGH SOFTLY] 
 Well, you know what they say. 
 One compliment from a woman is worth a thousand compliments from a man. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what my mom says about men? 
 No. What's that? 
 Someone else's problem. [LAUGHS]

 Is that your mom? 
 Car's here. DUKE: Coming, Mom.

 Thank you so much. CHEF: You're so welcome.

 Okay. 
 Thank you, Adall.

 WOMAN: Should I start? Okay. SAM: Yeah, um, we're almost set. 
 Uh, do I-do I just start talking? 
 SAM: What was it like first getting your period and then last getting your period? Mmm. [LAUGHS] 
 SAM: Your thoughts about be-being attractive, how you feel the world sees you. 
 Oh, my... 
 I'm at the end of my womanhood, and I'm having the greatest sexual love affair of my life. 
 That's probably the only good thing about menopause is the s*x afterwards is amazing. 
 I'm a horny gal. 
 I'm a horny 62-year-old. 
 [CHUCKLES] It was like a missile went up my v*g1n*. 
 It was so painful. 
 I think it's the greatest thing in the world to not have a period. 
 I'll get it every other three weeks, then I won't get it for three months. 
 I never had v*g1n* upkeep before. 
 [LAUGHS] This is new. 
 I'm 65. Uh, I'm in a relationship for the first time, really, in my life. 
 Uh, he loves me a lot. 
 Tells me I'm beautiful all the time, and I'm not really comfortable with that. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 It's not good. 
 It's not good. None of it's good. 
 I sweat. I'm grumpy. 
 It's an inferno coming from deep inside of you. 
 Putting it on, taking it off, putting it on. 
 I am comfortable with myself from the ankles down. 
 I have really good ankles. 
 I always have this image of what's normal for me, and when I look into the mirror now... it's not who I am. 
 Honestly, I have always-- in every fairy tale, in every childhood movie-- 
 I've always been drawn to the crone or the witch, and I've always found them the most interesting. 
 They have interesting faces. 
 And I remember, distinctly, being at a bar, and no one looked at me. No one noticed me. 
 It was literally like I was Casper the ghost, just looking through me. 
 I peaked a little too early, I think. 
 He was advocating that because I was older, I was hard up for action and would welcome being sexually assaulted on the street. 
 And that was the first time that I realized I was no longer the cute girl at work. 
 And then I'm like, "Oh, so I should feel bad about not being abused on the subway?" 
 That's super twisted. 
 On the other hand... it feels weird. 
 And I feel like I'm becoming more beautiful because I'm becoming more myself. 
 That's how I feel. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 I got my period when I was 12 years old. 
 I actually felt like it was a cool thing, like my body had this ability to do something incredible. 
 Like I was a part of something bigger than just myself. 
 I was now considered a woman. 
 But what I didn't realize then was that to be a woman in the world is to be built up and then let down. 
 They'd cut us or sell us or marry us off. 
 You're primed, and you're prepped and abused and adored and harassed and worshipped, and then... it all stops. 
 All of it. 
 We even age out of the bad things, like being fetishized or diminished or talked down to. 
 It's even worse. 
 You're invisible, and you're literally left hunched over and alone with Santa's belly and a beard to boot walking around, shrinking, thinking, "What just happened?" 
 [LAUGHS] 
 You retreat. 
 You're shamed. You're unseen. 
 No one has prepared you for it, and no one ever tells women this is gonna happen. 
 Our prize in the goody bag after everyone has had their fill of us is shingles, thin bones, whiskers and bunions. 
 You're not viable. 
 But if you have daughters, you feel it even more, because the world wants them now. 
 Then... menopause. 
 It's the grossest thing in the world. 
 Nobody wants to hear about it, which is why nobody ever prepared you for it. 
 You're a lady. 
 You're supposed to be pretty and attractive. 
 Even the Dalai Lama was like, "Eh, it's not great if a woman is... ugh." 
 I mean, even for the Dalai Lama, you got to be cute. 
 [ALL LAUGH] 
 "Yes. 
 "Inner beauty is most important. 
 But still, attractive." 
 I mean, even the f*cking Dalai Lama let us down. 
 Why don't we all say this to each other? 
 Women have to say this to each other. 
 Women are afraid to talk to each other. 
 Women should be brothers to each other. 
 We have to be brothers to each other. 
 I've got chills. 
 My mind is blown open.

 Period. Menopause.

 Like, witness protection face voice. 
 [CHUCKLES] SAM: Yes. 
 Damn, Mom. 
 You have balls. 
 Well... [CHUCKLING] 
 Eggs. Eggs. She got eggs. 
 Does she, though? FRANKIE: No, she don't got no eggs no more. [SAM LAUGHS] 
 [RICH LAUGHS] Word. 
 MAX: Like, I don't know, it was just, like, powerful how you said it and... 
 Thank you. MAX: Yeah. 
 I didn't know that's, like, how you felt. 
 Well, you know. RICH: I like the Dalai Lama bit. 
 That was hilarious. MAX: Yeah, that was so good. 
 FRANKIE: That was really good. SAM: Right? - The Dalai Lama. 
 [ALL LAUGH] Yeah. 
 He should get, uh, reincarnated as an elderly lady. 
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
 Like, in a tenement flat. Yeah. 
 With long, hangy tits. 
 Uh-huh. Perfect. DUKE: Oh, my God. 
 When he just looks in the mirror and, "Aah!" And it... 
 It's like Freaky Friday. [ALL LAUGHING]

 Let me pour you a drink. Mm. 
 Hello, I'm Phyllis. 
 Phyllis, it's Xander. 
 Oh. 
 I hadn't realized. 
 I just saw you at Frankie's event. 
 What are you here for? 
 Um, I invited him for dinner. 
 Oh, really? 
 Where are the girls? 
 Have they eaten already? 
 They're... not here. 
 I actually don't know where they are. 
 Ooh, isn't this a dry rub? 
 So you came for dinner and the girls were to be here. 
 Touch of one's own medicine. 
 Quite, isn't it? 
 Well, that's being a sport and not having sour grapes. 
 This calls for some schnapps. 
 I'll pop over to my house and get a bottle of slivovitz. 
 Way to buck up, old man. 
 Got to deal with the consequences, haven't we just? 
 Won't be long. [CHUCKLES QUIETLY]

 And... let's have some more wine. Yes, please, okay. 
 Any top offs? SAM: Yes. 
 Phyllis is looking great. 
 Is that what you got out of that? 
 Salud. - Salud. Salud. 
 [BRITISH ACCENT] Yes, way to buck up, old man. 
 Bit of a dry rub. 
 [LAUGHS] I mean, come on... 
 Xander, seriously, I mean, what is it that you do, exactly? 
 What is it I do? 
 And what is it you do? Weren't you supposed to be importing liquid sugar from Japan? 
 Wasn't that one of your things? 
 Or was it wood pulp and raw copper from Chile? 
 How'd that work out for you? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 What about you? 
 Weren't you writing a book or something? 
 Shouldn't you have, like, four published novels by now? 
 What are you, J.D. Salinger? 
 Are you sitting on seven unseen works? 
 Yeah, uh... I'm gonna, uh, self-publish on Amazon. 
 I'm getting to it, but... you know I have an actual day job, right? 
 Yeah. But is it your passion? 
 Is it my what? 
 Is it my passion? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Does it make you smile when you do it? 
 Does it make you love your life?

 Hmm. 
 Hmm, well... it's really been, uh... something. Yeah, well, Thank you for your hospitality. don't... 
 Don't be a stranger. 
 Yeah, I'll try not to be. 
 By that, I mean you're gonna try to see the girls before you leave again, right? 
 I mean, this was, obviously, a test. 
 Hopefully. 
 Oh. Yeah.

 Sam, can I speak to you for a moment, please? 
 Oh. Uh... 
 Yeah. Okay... yeah.

 Um... this is awkward.

 Uh, do you have that... payment for me? 
 Oh. 
 Oh, uh, yeah.

 I have it. I didn't think we were still doing that.

 Last one. [CHUCKLES] Well... you didn't have to do it all in one payment.
