 Some people use it, like, to settle their stomach. If you... 
 Happy Father's Day, mothers! 
 Hey. Hi, hi, hi. 
 Oh, you made bruschetta? Hi, lovely. 
 I'm making bruschetta. Oh, hey there, Sunny. 
 My ex is with Hiya's ex. This is Hiya. 
 Oh, hi. Uh, Chaya. 
 Chaya. Hiya. 
 Chaya. It's a hard C-H. 
 Hard. Like, uh, challah French toast. Chaya. 
 Hiya. 
 I can't with these shiksas. 
 Hiya just got separated, too. 
 Our husbands work together. Ex-husbands. 
 Ex-husband. Get used to saying it. No. 
 I'm not saying it. 
 He's just having a moment. He's coming back. 
 I got to believe he's coming back. 
 That's what I thought in the beginning. 
 Ha! Okay, just reminding everyone. Yeah, right. Exactly. 
 Lesbian. Single mom. 
 Every mom is a single mom. 
 No, no. Real single mom, not divorced single mom. 
 Stop bragging. 
 So, where are your kids? 
 Jeff took them camping. Mmm. 
 His mantra is to be the best dad and ex-husband he possibly can be. 
 That's so annoying. 
 Wait, why? 
 Why? Why? 
 Because of the years. 
 Do you know how many years we spent sitting at the kitchen table with you crying over him and me begging for you to leave him? 
 Five years. 
 Five. 
 Five years. 
 You were tortured, and now that he's not your problem anymore, he's amazing. 
 I know. It's crazy, but we're really happier than we ever have been, and we're working on being the best exes we can be to each other. 
 Why is that...? That's-that's great. 
 Good for you, I guess. I just... 
 I just can't ever do something like that. 
 That's not... 
 That's big. 
 Oh. 
 This is happening because of you. 
 You got me through the dark days. 
 Oh, man. 
 It's my job. 
 Don't forget, okay? 
 Never forget. 
 Damn. I wanted to be like Jennifer Garner. 
 She's the number one best ex-wife in the world. 
 She's so pretty. She cooks. 
 You cook. How does she get over it? 
 He shtups the nanny, he breaks his sobriety, she jumps in the car, she drives him to rehab, and now they all go on vacations together with the kids. 
 I'm gonna be sick. 
 And she composts and makes her own honey and probably mead and... 
 I love her hair. 
 We were having a honeymoon of a divorce. 
 We were gonna handle the whole thing ourselves on the Internet. 
 Okay. This is mediators. Mediators. But I'm gonna... 
 But we-we can do it online. Mediators are here. Lawyers... Yeah. 
 What are we gonna do with our rings? 
 I guess I never got that far. Hock them. 
 We can hock them, yeah. 
 We were gonna live, like, on a compound and raise the girls together. 
 Then his mother got into his head. 
 He's ready for you. 
 So, you're LeBron, and this is the key. 
 But you can't get through, you can't get through. 
 So what do you do? 
 Basketball not your sport? 
 How's this? Divorce... is like hockey. 
 You have face-offs and fights, goals, heroes, villains. 
 But the kids are the puck. 
 Can we do soccer? 
 I don't know soccer. 
 Let me make this easy. 
 You make more money than he does. 
 So? 
 So, in the words of the immortal Jim Morrison, come on, baby, settle. 
 Let's settle. 
 And I've been paying ever since. 
 Did I tell you that Tom now refers to his 25-year-old girlfriend as his soul mate? Ew. 
 How fun is that. 
 So, when he was 30, a baby was born with part of his soul, and now he has s*x with it? 
 Yeah. 
 Someone please tell me why the hell she'd want to be with him. 
 He has a cyst on his left testicle that swells in the heat. 
 He has to constantly ice his old balls in the summer. 
 No! I'm eating. 
 I cannot wait till he has his second family after 60. 
 I hope they're twins, and I hope that maybe coaching all their sports and sh1t will kill him. 
 Baruch Hashem. 
 - Baruch Hashem. Baruch Hashem. 
 - Baruch Hashem. Cheers to that. 
 Least you know why he left. 
 Yeah, Richard swears up and down it's not another woman. 
 I don't even understand what happened. 
 I thought we were happy. 
 And I don't know how I'm gonna live without him. Oh, baby. 
 Oh, man. 
 Okay. Circle. 
 Do you want a Xanax? 
 Yes, I do. 
 How many? Three. 
 Good. Is that all? 
 The doctor is in. 
 Widows are so lucky. 
 Sam. 
 I'm just saying. We don't all hate them. Stop. 
 What? 
 You know, Ari wasn't perfect. 
 And to be fair, I was the one who cheated on him. 
 Thank God we ended it before it went too far south. 
 Did you know the whole time that he was gay? 
 Gay? 
 Ari's not gay. 
 No, I know. 
 This kills me. 
 I got to tell you this before he gets here. 
 Tom wants to know what brand of sheets I buy. 
 What? This dude. 
 Does he want me to, like, put roses on his pillows before he gets home to go to bed? 
 You're not texting him back. But then I'm a dick because I'm icing him out on Father's Day. 
 I like it. Ice his balls. 
 Ice his balls, baby. 
 Ugh, can we stop talking about balls? 
 Yeah. 
 Wait a second. Wait a second. 
 He's coming here? 
 He's dropping off the twins. 
 Okay. The fun never stops, even when we get rid of him. 
 Hey, Sam. 
 Hi. 
 Smells good in here. Thank you. 
 Are you staying? 
 I know you like hanging out at lady gatherings. 
 Just dropping off the kids. 
 On Father's Day. 
 Nice. 
 I spent the entire day with them. 
 W-Was that a whole four hours with your own kids? 
 Impressive. Hmm. 
 You've always been gunning for me. 
 Wh-What is your problem? 
 You're a terrible husband. 
 How do you know? 
 Lala tells me everything. 
 She does? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Did she tell you how when the twins were born, she got so depressed she could barely take care of them? 
 I-I know about that. 
 That was... that was hard. 
 Yeah. Uh, yeah. 
 That-that was hard, Sam. 
 Do you know that when her mom died, she just never bounced back? 
 That I begged her to get help, but she refused? 
 And do you know she hasn't let me touch her in two years? 
 She tell you that? 
 Yes, I finally called it, but this has been a long time coming. 
 You may not like me, and that's fine, but you have no idea what my story is, and you have no right to judge someone else's marriage. 
 You've been divorced a long time now. 
 Don't you worry? About what? 
 Your bitterness. 
 You're getting brittle and hard. 
 It's not a good look on you, Sam. 
 Yeah, well, at least I don't have to ice my balls when it's hot outside! 
 - Okay. Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I was gonna walk and see you. 
 Pretty good, so I won't move around. Yeah. 
 We got married when we were 18. 
 At 21, he started being very, very mean to me. 
 But... in those days, you didn't get divorced. 
 So you stayed together until you were 90? 
 You know, it seemed the best thing to do would be just to stay there and not leave. 
 And, uh, I was, I was going to be dying soon anyway. 
 And so was he. 
 But when we both turned 90, I just had had enough. 
 So... 
 I left him. 
 And that was 17 years ago. 
 And these have been the happiest 
 17 years of my entire life. 
 All right, Pearl! 
 Thatta girl. 
 Okay, baby! 
 Did you get all that? 
 Isn't she great? 
 I am the patron saint of divorced children. 
 And if you have any questions, you ask me. 
 I'm here to give you free legal advice. 
 Now, if the divorce is new, there's gonna be a honeymoon period. 
 Ziva? 
 What's a honeymoon period? 
 Well, it's not an actual honeymoon, but it's when the... 
 What, Andi? 
 I haven't gotten my period yet. 
 Womp, womp, womp.

 Oh, my God. 
 That was beautiful. That was cathartic. 
 Oh, that felt good! 
 Crossing over. How talented. 
 What about you? Not that talented. 
 So who are you dating, Sam? 
 What? Oh. 
 No. 
 I don't. I'm on a time-out. 
 I don't play well with others. 
 All right. If this doesn't work out, I am going to have spend every other Christmas totally alone. 
 Well, you could always come to my house and watch me and Murray fight with the cat over the tinsel, huh? 
 I'm getting a drink. 
 Why, no? 
 No, you come to mine. You come to mine. 
 Or hers, see? All good. 
 I think it's a good offer. 
 Can I come to your house for Christmas? 
 Done. 
 The title of my speech is called 
 "Divorce: The Gift that Keeps on Giving." 
 Did you know that as children of divorced families we're 50% as likely to grow up and get divorced ourselves? 
 So if you get divorced in your future, blame your mom and dad. 
 Our next speaker is the Fox family accountant, Mr. Rey Rodriguez. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Just a heads-up, I was raised by a single mom. 
 Never even knew my dad. 
 I don't know my dad, either. My man. 
 That's what's up. Yeah. 
 Okay, so as far as money goes, there's only a few things you need to know right now. 
 First of all, there's a simple rule called the 20-50-30, all right? 
 Let's say you make a dollar. 
 You save 20 cents, you spend 50 cents on something you need and 30 cents on something you want. 
 You. Do you have any tips of how to stop your mom from crying all the time? 
 Just give her a hug. 
 Anybody here have a bank account? 
 Because I came to talk about money. 
 We're kids. So what? 
 You want to retire before you're 85? 
 'Cause that sh1t's real. 
 I can't wait till Murray starts smoking weed so I can stop hiding from him. Mm. 
 Come here. I'm gonna shotgun you. 
 Open your mouth. 
 May I join you? 
 What was that thing you were doing? 
 Looked very fun. 
 I'd like to try that. 
 Sure. Gran? 
 Gran, let's go. Come on. 
 You said we were going somewhere special. 
 Oh, bollocks. 
 During the Shah's reign, the British-owned oil industry was nationalized. 
 That was his first mistake that he made that led to the revolution. 
 I'm very impressed, miss. 
 How do you know so much about Persian history? 
 Ubers... you see, I like to talk to people. 
 And 99% of the time, they like to talk to me. 
 
 
 
 There's so much to be learned from Uber drivers about... 
 Too much water. 
 I asked for half a glass. 
 Oh, my God, Nan! 
 What?! It's a waste. 
 Well, yeah, but now he has to go and pour it out... 
 Persian. 
 They use that word to distinguish themselves from the theocratic Iranians back home. 
 It's nonsense. 
 They should call themselves Iranians. 
 Persia hasn't existed since 1935. 
 So who wants to go next? 
 "Dear Ari, "I am sorry I cheated on you. 
 "I just had to get out of the marriage. 
 "I was so unhappy. 
 "I don't think I ever loved you. 
 "There was so much pressure put on me 
 "by my family to get married and have kids, "and you were kind and handsome, "and so I said yes without a thought. 
 "Please forgive me. 
 "I hope you find a woman who will love you and our kids." 
 "Dear Richard, "Out of everyone in the world, I chose you. 
 "And in choosing you, I wasn't only saying this is my man. 
 "I was also saying 
 "this is me. 
 "I trust myself enough to know 
 "what is right for me, what I need, "what I say yes to in life. 
 "Marrying you was the greatest validation 
 "of the trust I have in myself. 
 "Which is why this is so painful. 
 "I question myself. 
 "I don't trust myself anymore. 
 "I've lost my compass. 
 "I forgive you. 
 "I do, and I'll never stop loving you. 
 "But it's going to take a long time before I'll be able to forgive myself." 
 "Tom, "I'm glad I finally found the courage 
 "to move on from a relationship that was going nowhere. 
 "For the sake of myself and our kids. 
 "I'm livid not only that you moved on so fast, "but that it's with someone that hasn't got 
 "the physical, emotional and neurological challenges 
 "that I do. 
 "Now your life will be so much easier, "and you won't have to face 
 "all those disappointments we've discussed for years. 
 "But, hey... 
 I just have to remind myself that neither do I." 
 "I will never forget watching "The Matrix" with you 
 "and being so worried you wouldn't get it, but you did. 
 "I remember loving you so much at that moment. 
 "Then we had some dark days. 
 "I felt so unwanted, so rejected. 
 "I know it was your insecurity, "but I just couldn't take it. 
 "I don't know our future, but I do know I'm glad you are their dad." Oh. 
 "I forgive you. 
 Let us both live in our truth." 
 Sam? 
 Oof. 
 Y-You know what? 
 I think I-I... I think I... 
 I want to read mine. 
 I think I should. 
 "Dear Hitler and Hitler's son, "Why aren't you dead yet? 
 "How are you? How is your day? 
 "How do you live with yourself? 
 "I don't care how you treat me, but what about your kids? 
 "How do you divorce your own kids? 
 "They're the best thing that ever happened to both of us. 
 "Wondering how you sleep at night and why you aren't dead. 
 Love, Sam." 
 Oh. Okay. 
 I got to let this sh1t go. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Let this sh1t go. 
 Let this sh1t go. Just... That's a good idea. 
 There we go. 
 Yeah. Yes. 
 Yeah. Oh, that's-that's a beauty. 
 Get a good burn. That's a beauty right there. 
 Burn it. It needs to get out. 
 Go from under. Bye. 
 Yeah. Bye. 
 Out, damn spot! 
 _ 
 _ 
 Look what the girls texted me. 
 Little pumpkins. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Happy Father's Day. 
 Oh, happy Father's Day, Father. 
 You excited for your party? 
 You gonna speak Spebrew or Hebrish or whatever? 
 You know, when I was growing up, my father was hardly ever around. 
 My parents stayed married, but my mother raised us all. 
 Every mother is a single mother, you know. 
 She worked three jobs, and he didn't have f*ck all to do with us. 
 One morning, I was walking across the square, and I looked up, and there was my father holding hands with a woman. 
 He turned as white as a ghost. 
 He dropped the hand of the woman. 
 It wasn't my mother's hand, you see. 
 He walked over to me. 
 "Phil," he said. 
 "Yes, Father." 
 He handed me a sixpence, and I went on my way. 
 We never spoke of it. 
 I tried to call my dad today to say "Happy Father's Day," but his voice mail was full. 
 That was very generous of you. 
 You know, I don't not want to have a relationship with my dad. 
 You know, I don't want to live out this, like, legacy of shitty dads generationally or whatever. 
 You know... Well, I hope you know... 
 It's most likely that he won't show up for your party. 
 I don't care. Gran, stop. 
 All right. 
 I got something I want to give you for your bat-whatever, but I don't want to give it to you at the party and get it lost in all the kerfuffle. 
 Oh, my God. Mm. 
 It's real gold. 
 Gran. 
 It belonged to my grandfather. 
 He was a bit of a tosspot, but I loved him. 
 It's beautiful. Mm. 
 I love it. You do? 
 Aw. 
 Thank you. 
 One bun, two buns, three buns, four buns, five buns. This is bun six. 
 I think I got it right this time. Okay. 
 I... it's... I-I don't even know. 
 I mean, she's-she's so strict, and, like, there can't even be a hair out of place. 
 Like, it has to be glued down. 
 Okay, come back. I'll put more gel in it. 
 Duke, is Mom making you go? 
 No, no. I want to go. 
 You should've seen her. She was so pissed after I gave up soccer. What did she say? 
 But it's not like she was the one that had to do it. 
 Like, it's my choice. Yeah, if you don't want to do soccer, you don't have to do soccer. 
 What's up? 
 What's going on? 
 We just want to be with the sisters now. 
 Copy that. 
 Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool. 
 Okay. 
 It's nice, though... There. 
 ... that you guys have sisters. 
 So, you got this? 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right? I'll just... 
 I'll just go throw myself off the side of the freeway. 
 Ooh, fun. Yes. 
 To the garbage with me! 
 Don't worry about this. 
 I just, you know... ah... I have a better idea. 
 I'm going to chop myself up into little pieces and flush myself down the toilet. 
 That's the natural place for me to go. 
 And, uh, you guys better hope that I flush myself down super toilet. 
 Otherwise, I will clog up the regular toilets, and you guys... 
 All right, bye, Mom. 
 ... don't even know how to use a plunger. 
 I don't think you've ever touched one or... know how to spell it, but that's fine. 
 I have stuff to do. 
 I can go do stuff. 
 Frankie?! 
 I mean, we can hang out. 
 It's cool. 
 It's nice sisters want to be together with no mom. 
 That's fine. 
 That's cute. My work here is done. 
 It's obviously done. 
 Nobody needs me anymore. 
 That's fine. Cool.
