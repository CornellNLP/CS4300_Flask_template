 'I'm not a druggie. It helps me turn my brain off.' 
 You just need to let me in, give me a chance. 
 Imagine an internal voice shouting, "Jump." 
 You hurt me and you've been hurt yourself. 
 Lizzie. Thanks for this. 
 What are sisters for? 
 (Car alarm beeps) 
 sh1t! 
 (Phone rings) 
 (She turns it off) 
 Jenna Moss. Sorry, I'm a couple of minutes late. 
 No problem. Would you like to take a seat? 
 Oké, thank you. Sorry, did you get my text? 
 Yeah. Yes - and they're idiots. It's their loss. 
 You'll get another contract. 
 It's just typical, after the tax audit and everything that happened with Watkinson's. 
 Why does all the crap have to happen at once? 
 The law of threes. 
 Let's hope you've had yours now. 
 God, I'm so scared. 
 Fourth time lucky. 
 Yeah. 
 Fourth time lucky. 
 (Machine beeps) 
 I'm afraid it's not good news. 
 (Jenna sobs) 
 You know what this is? Persecution, bullying and, aside from anything else, it's completely inaccurate. 
 He's 37. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, since you clearly require facts, I have had this six-inch pen1s inside eight different vaginas. 
 (Retches) 
 And only one of them involved a cash transaction. So... 
 ♪ Like a virgin ♪ 
♪ Woo! ♪ 
♪ Touched for the very first time... ♪ 
 Good meeting? Mm, absolutely. 
 Er, don't forget, I'm leaving early this afternoon. 
 Diary's clear. But I will be back for the charity night. 
 Everyone's excited for the awards. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. 
 Play your cards right, you might win Best PA. 
 No interruptions for an hour, I've got calls to make. 
 I've got a plan. 
 It's actually quite brilliant. 
 Do you want to hear it? 
 It involves you and me and several bottles of extremely good wine. 
 I've got this work thing. 
 Tell them you're sick. They know I'm not sick. 
 Well, you're the boss, what are they going to do? 
 We'd end up talking about it. 
 We wouldn't want to, but we would. 
 And I don't want to talk about it because... quite frankly, I am sick to the back teeth of talking about my useless body. 
 So, the next award is the It's Five O'Clock Somewhere award for the most eager to finish a shift. 
 Now, this was a hotly-contested category, but the jury found one worker to be unswerving in their dedication for clocking off and heading to the pub. 
 So the winner of the 2016 It's Five O'Clock Somewhere award goes to none other than Karl Shelvey. 
 Yes! Come on! 
 (Applause) 
 (Chanting) : Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! 
 Speech! Speech! Speech! 
 (Feedback) 
 To quote my late grandfather - "Add another note to your pay cheque. Are you done digging your grave yet?" 
 MC : Get off. 
 Oké, Karl Shelvey, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
 The man, the myth - Karl, ladies and gentlemen, come on. 
 (Applause) 
 (Phone rings) 
 Music : "Hungry Like The Wolf" by Duran Duran. 
 How's Ash? 
 Back home - but I took your advice, we haven't really been in touch. 
 Back home? 
 They put him on some new meds, super strong. 
 He's promised to stay on them, give them a chance. 
 Kim says he doesn't really do much, just sits around watching YouTube all day. 
 No wonder he's depressed. 
 Hey... dance? 
 Remember, I'm an old man, so watch my hips. 
 Karl, is it true you still live with your mum? 
 No, Fletch, she lives with me. There's a difference. 
 Karl! Why have you got so much cash? 
 Because I'm frequenting somewhere later that doesn't do credit. 
 Ugh... 
 I thought you'd gone. 
 (She chuckles) 
 No, it appears not. 
 The others are going on to a party, if you fancy it. 
 No... thank you. 
 I've... I'm gonna head off. 
 But have a good night. 
 Be careful, though. 
 Jag's lurking. 
 'Lizzie, it's Jenna.' 
 Yep, I got your message. Let me guess - some money? 
 Well, shall I tell you what I want? 
 I want to go out. Tonight. To a club. 
 I want to go out, I want to drink, I want to dance, I want to get off my face. 
 Right now, that is exactly what I need. 
 I don't believe it. There I was, sat on my sofa in my PJs. 
 Never thought it'd be you dragging me out on the razz. 
 Aaron! 
 Friend. Back in a sec. 
 You sharing that? 
 Sharing what? 
 Oh, no, no, no. You stick to your chardonnay. 
 Oh, piss off. A tiny bit. 
 Good girl. 
 Oh, Jes... Shh. 
 Doorman : Bags open. sh1t! 
 Music : "Insomnia" by Faithless.

 (Song kicks in) 
 Music : "The Power" by DJ Fresh feat. Dizzee Rascal. 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Raised voices) 
 (People shout) 
 Woman : Help! Help! 
 Someone get help! 
 You, dial 999 now! 
 Woman : Help! 
 (People shout) 
 Woman : Get an ambulance! 
 Lizzie, where are you? Where did you go? 
 What happened in the club? Call me. Just call me. 
 TV : 'I'm hoping to make about £100, so I can treat myself to a day out at a spa, or something like that. Have a few treatments.' 
 Jen, where the hell have you been? 
 You were right. I needed a drink. 
 Drink? 
 It's three o'clock in... 
 Who've you been with? I... 
 I was worried. 
 Er, work people. 
 A couple of reps. 
 I just... I just wanted to have a good time. 
 And you couldn't call? 
 Well, I'm going to bed. I've got a case review at 8:30. 
 Morning. Hello. 
 You seen the state of this lot? 
 You know, the best thing about being teetotal is the morning after a night out. 
 (Whistle) 
 Come on, crew! Sales, sales, sales! 
 Hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo... We need to talk. 
 Oh. I don't like the sound of that. 
 Come on, come on, come on! 
 Energy, energy, energy, energy... 
 They're dropping us, just like that? So much for loyalty, eh? 
 It's not just like that, it's part of a larger strategic review. 
 Right, so I take it it's, what, belt-tightening, no overtime, weekend cuts? 
 Let's not panic them. 
 Use stealth, yeah? I think we keep it to ourselves for now and then when we've got better news, we... 
 (Phone rings) 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry, I'm going to have to take this. Right. Hold on. 
 Give me one minute. 
 Stealth? 
 Why didn't you call me back? 
 'I'm calling you now.' 
 So what happened? 
 Last night, in the club with the lads? 
 'I don't know. The guy collapsed, started fitting. I don't know, Jen, maybe he's epileptic or something.' 
 He collapsed because of the drugs. 
 'His mates took 'em, you took 'em. I didn't see anyone else hitting the deck. I couldn't just hang around there, could I? A month out of prison.' 
 What was it that we were taking? 
 'Jenna.' What was...! 
 What was it? 
 'GHB. Look, he wanted it, all right? I wasn't forcing it down his neck. He's a young lad, he overdid it, he'll be fine. Just put it out your head, oké? We weren't there. Never happened.' 
 (Notification beeps) 
 Hiya. Hi. 
 Sorry. 
 I should've called. 
 I just... I needed a night off, you know? 
 Shut my brain down. I understand. 
 I spent the evening watching Dirty Grandpa. 
 Shall we get some dinner? 
 After work? 
 Talk things through - or not talk, just have a nice time? 
 Sounds good. You choose somewhere and text me. 
 I've got a partners' meeting around five which might run over, so about sevenish? 
 Yeah, yeah, perfect. 
 I'll just pop home first, get changed. 
 Sarah-Jane? 
 (Hairdryer blares) 
 (Banging on door) 
 (She switches hairdyer off) 
 Hi, can I... can I help? 
 Jennifer Moss? Yeah. 
 Can we come in? 
 I'm arresting you on suspicion of possession with intention to supply a controlled substance on Thursday 29th October 2016 at 2:30am at the club Amplify, Harness Street, Cardiff. 
 You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. 
 Anything you do say may be given in evidence. 
 We're going to search the property. 
 Are there any controlled substances in the flat right now? 
 No. 
 Nothing... 
 Drugs? 
 House keys. 
 I'll also have your mobile phone. 
 Passcode? 1010. 
 Left thumb. 
 Left ring finger. 
 (Machine beeps) 
 Are you taking any medication prescribed by the doctor? 
 Have you taken controlled substances in the past 30 days? 
 Yeah. 
 (Door thuds) 
 (Bolt rattles) 
 (Door crashes) 
 Right... 
 They have CCTV images from inside the nightclub. 
 And they've worked backwards from the collapse. 
 And what it shows them is yourself with another woman talking to the lads. 
 But the reason for your arrest is they have an image of you handing over a small bottle of liquid. 
 They're saying drugs. 
 And they're claiming that these drugs Ied directly to the unfortunate event. 
 They weren't my drugs. Whose were they? 
 I just... I... I just took them in. 
 It would help you if you could tell them whose drugs they were and the reason why you carried them. 
 Look... 
 They were me sister's and she's just come out of prison. She's not a dealer, but she... She just... 
 Oké, i understand. 
 Can I make a suggestion? 
 Jenna? 
 Jenna? 
 "The drugs were given to me in the nightclub queue... and because of my state of mind that evening - I had just discovered that my IVF pregnancy had failed for the fourth time - I made an error of judgment and took a small quantity of drugs when it was offered. Then, in haste and fear of being seen by the doorman, I concealed the bottle inside my clothing. Once inside the club, I returned the drug to the person that had passed it to me. I had no idea who brought the drug, where it came from or what the purpose of its possession was." 
 I have, um, advised my client to offer "no comment" answers to any further questions. 
 Thank you... for your statement. 
 We accept your right to silence but we'd still like to ask you some questions, Miss Moss. 
 Are you a drug dealer, Miss Moss? 
 Drug dealer? 
 No comment. 
 When Nathan Segal collapsed, you left the club immediately. 
 Were you not concerned for his wellbeing? 
 No comment. 
 As did the woman you were with, the woman you handed the drugs to. 
 No comment. 
 Prior to your night out, you made calls to a woman by the name of Elizabeth Marshall. 
 Was that the woman you were with? 
 No comment. 
 And, after leaving the club, after the collapse of Nathan Segal, you made calls to the mobile phone of Elizabeth Marshall a total of 11 times between that night and the following afternoon. 
 In addition, there were a number of texts requesting her to call you. 
 Why was that, Miss Moss? What was so urgent? 
 No comment. 
 Elizabeth Marshall... whom our records show was recently released from HMP Exmoor. 
 I need you to at least say "no comment." 
 No comment. 
 Jenna Moss, date of birth 5th of April 1976, at 148 Saltmarsh Street, Cardiff, you are charged with the offence shown below - that you did, on Thursday 29th October at 2:30am in the club Amplify, Harness Street, Cardiff, supply a controlled substance, GHB, or believing it to be GHB, to Nathan Segal, contrary to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. 
 What? I need to come in. 
 Yeah, it's not a good time. Tough. Jenna! 
 Listen, I've got a friend here and, without going into detail, things are getting very... Get rid of him. 
 No. 
 Liz, I am not pissing around. This is serious. 
 I have been arrested. 
 Charged, so get his dick back in his trousers and show him the door. 
 Arrested? 
 What happened? 
 The police came, took me in. 
 They've got CCTV of us at the club with the lads. Oh, sh1t. 
 Did they mention me? 
 Yeah. Yes, they mentioned you. 
 They checked my phone, they saw all the calls between us. Oh, sh1t. 
 What are they doing? What did they say? 
 They've charged me! 
 Intent to supply, possession. 
 This is... 
 I'll lose my job. Drugs! 
 I could go to prison! 
 The solicitor said that they almost always get a custodial. 
 And the lad collapsing just makes it even worse! 
 Is the lad all right? He's stable. 
 Your mate's looking down. Piss off! 
 sh1t. 
 So, when they were talking about me, did they say that they saw me with the lads? Did they say they saw me taking the gear? No. 
 No, I don't think so. You'd moved the... 
 The images that they showed me were of me handing the bottle over, so you have to tell them, Lizzie, because they think it was mine. 
 You have to come down and you have to tell them who the dealer is. 
 Yeah? 
 Look, I was vague. I was vague. 
 The solicitor advised me, so I give a statement and then I just... 
 I stuck to no comment. I did not drop you in it. 
 So get everything that you've got out of the house first and then you come down... No, listen, listen, listen. 
 You come down with me and you tell them from your own voice that you bought the drugs. 
 No, no, no, you found them on the street and we will then tell them that the lads came and they asked... begged, they begged to have some off us. 
 They're saying I was dealing, Lizzie... They'll charge us both. 
 No, they won't. Oh, God, will you stop being so f*cking naive? 
 I only just got out and I am not going back. 
 You won't? No, I won't. 
 Because I'm not doing it. 
 What...? 
 All you've got to do is say who you got the drugs from. 
 I've got a record. But not for drugs, though! 
 Hey, you were the one who wanted the night out, all right? 
 You were the one who called me. What were the words you used? 
 "I want to get off my face." I needed to have some fun! 
 Yeah, so did I. 
 That's all that I wanted, some fun, and now I've got all this. 
 Tell them the truth? 
 Tell them who my dealer is? 
 Look, it's him, all right? I'm shagging him! 
 How's that going to play? 
 I am not going back to prison, Jenna. I can't do it. 
 I cannot do another three years because some little prick can't handle his gear. Liz, wait. 
 I am not doing it. 
 What...? 
 But then... 
 What the hell am I supposed to... to tell Jake? He doesn't know anything about it. 
 He doesn't even know about you! 
 And why's that, then, Jenna? 
 You have to help me! 
 Help you? Help you?! 
 What, get myself banged up so that you can stay out? Huh? 
 Is that what you want, me back on the inside so you can carry on with your great life? 
 My great life? 
 My great life?! 
 I... I got this because I have worked and I have worked and I have worked, because you got all the luck, Lizzie, when we were kids. 
 You got all the f*cking breaks. 
 Nice foster family come along, eh? 
 Decide to adopt, who do they want? 
 Lizzie? Yeah, because you were... 
 Because you kept running away! 
 Because I was angry! 
 (Dog barks) 
 I was angry. 
 I didn't want people knowing that I had a junkie mum... 
 Shh! 
 ..knowing that my dad had spent 40 quid to spunk inside her. 
 Shh! 
 I got this life because I shoved that sh1t as far away from me as I could. 
 But you - you! - you got out and you still tossed it up against the wall and do you know why, eh? You know why? 
 Cos you're just like me mam! You bitch! 
 Get off! Get off! 
 You don't help me... I'll go to the police, and I will answer their questions. 
 And I will tell them exactly what happened. 
 And that would be a big mistake. 
 I'm not losing everything I have fought for, Lizzie. 
 Not for you! 
 (Door slams) 
 
 
 
 Jake, don't talk, just listen, oké? 
 Can you do that for me? 'Where are you? What's happened to the flat?' Jake, please. 
 'Oké. So, talk.' 
 I'm in a hotel. 
 I'm not coming home tonight. 
 I need some space. 
 And it's not you, it's not anything that you've done, I just... I can't come home right now. 
 'Jenna, what does that even mean? Is it the baby? Because if it is, I understand.' Jake... I love you so much. 
 I just can't come home right now. 
 (She sobs) 
 Morning, Jen. 
 Morning! 
 She looks terrible. 
 You know what? She's usually like Little Miss Perfect. 
 There's something wrong. I know it. 
 You didn't hear this from me... What is it? 
 We lost the Harlington contract. sh1t! No! Yeah. 
 She's claiming it's fine, but she's obviously stressed out about it. 
 You can't tell anyone. Seriously, only me and Joe know. 
 I won't say a word. Me either. 
 Harlington contract. 
 sh1t, that's massive. 
 Are our jobs at risk? Well, it's not looking good, is it? 
 Toke said that's like 25% of our business. 
 Well, he said 23%, but... 
 I can't get laid off, I've just booked Platja d'en Bossa. 
 Oh, mate. 
 Still, in the history of human tragedy, it's hardly Chernobyl, is it? 
 Is it Chernobyl, Ally? 
 No, Karl, it's not Chernobyl. 
 Exactly, it's not Chernobyl. 
 What's Chernobyl? 
 Sarah-Jane, I don't care if she's not taking any calls, it's not a call, it's a visitor. 
 Tell her she's got a visitor. His name's Aaron. 
 Like "keep your HAIR ON." 
 Hold on. 
 Aaron who? Lizzie's boyfriend. 
 You can't be here. 
 What do you think you're doing? Who do you think you are, coming here? 
 Get angry with me, if you want, but I'm here to help you. 
 Help me? 
 Sort your little problem. 
 My problem, if I choose to make it so, is very much YOUR problem. 
 Not really, cos I'll just deny it and no-one's got any proof. 
 So, how are you going to help me, then, exactly? 
 You want the cops to blame Lizzie. 
 I can make that a reality. 
 Capiche? 
 Capiche. 
 Reality costs money. 
 You know that, you're a woman of the world. 
 So, you're blackmailing me. 
 Blackmail? 
 How much? 
 50 grand. 
 Funny that, is it? 
 50K for your freedom. 
 50K to get yourself off the hook. 
 No chance! 
 Staff know, do they, about all this? 
 Bosses, shareholders? 
 So, you are blackmailing me. 
 Probably only need to tell one of them. 
 It will whistle round, juicy gossip like that. 
 You cannot seriously ask me for £50,000. 
 40, then. 
 Five. Five? 
 Now who's taking the piss? 
 30, I'll get you a witness. 
 Someone who'll say they saw Lizzie dealing in the club. No. 
 25. 
 You've come down. 
 Someone should teach you the art of negotiation. 
 20. 
 And still you come down. 
 No, because I don't trust you. 
 Fine. 
 I'll just wait here and chat to your staff as they leave, shall I? 
 Fine. 
 Fine, I'll just get my security guard to lock you to the gate. 
 Or, better still, I'll just call the police. Police? 
 Pally with them now, aren't you? 
 Aaron... thank you very much for your offer, but some years ago I left the gutter behind and I do not intend on going back there. Gutter? 
 Only place you're going is prison. 
 And, believe me, posh bird like you, they'll destroy you. 
 My card. 
 If you change your mind. 
 sh1t! 
 Have you got an appointment? 
 No, I don't, my name's Jacob Curtis... 
 Can I borrow your car? Mine's in the garage. 
 I'll have it back by five. I'll reimburse the petrol. 
 Cheers. 
 Oh, the Take That CD is my wife's! 
 I'm on the AppGate. 
 Jenna. Jen! 
 Where's Kim? 
 Where's Kim?! 
 Where's Kim? Are you oké? I need Kim. 
 sh1t. sh1t! Ally, what is it? 
 You in your car? Yeah, why? Come on. 
 What are they saying? Are they on their way? 
 They said they'll get there, but you know what cops are like. 
 We need to get there! Can you go any faster?! 
 I'm doing 40 in a 30. Ray! 
 (Tyres screech) 
 sh1t! Move out the way! 
 Ray, u-turn! 
 There's someone behind. 
 Ally! 
 Where are you going? You can't leave it there! 
 (Honking) 
 Ash! 
 Ash! 
 Ash! 
 Ash? Ash! 
 Oh, God, Ash. 
 How many? 
 Ash, how many? 
 Not enough. 
 I couldn't do it. I couldn't even do that. 
 Oh! 
 I just want to go, Ally. 
 No, you don't. 
 No, people get past it. 
 Like, if you just let yourself out, you might look back on this one day and think, "Thank God." 
 Thank God, because being alive is so brilliant. 
 It's not. 
 It's not for me. 
 You oké? Ambulance. Get help. 
 (Ash groans) 
 I just want it all to stop! 
 Everything in here, I want it away! 
 What about the medication, Ash? Like, did you take the medication? 
 It's your brain not working right, but you've got to let them help you, Ash! 
 What, in the madhouse? 
 With the freaks? 
 Please, for your mum. It's got to be better than this. 
 At least give it a try. 
 Oké. 
 (She sobs) 
 (Metallic clanging) 
 'Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Emily. She had a shop. It was a rather unusual shop because it didn't sell anything. Everything in that shop window was a thing that somebody had once lost.' 
 (She sobs) 
 (Sirens wail) 
 'Jenna, I'm not going to lie, this is difficult.' 
 And, frankly, the duty solicitor who advised you to no comment needs stringing up. 
 But you've done the right thing, coming here. 
 So, how do we approach it? 
 You're an extremely well-respected businesswoman. 
 Your sister is a convicted criminal. 
 Her boyfriend is a drug dealer, doubtless known to the police. 
 I'm going to make a series of observations regarding the events of that evening. 
 I'd like you to listen and then think, if we were to make a second statement, what that second statement might look like. 
 (Oil sizzles) 
 I'm sorry. 
 I lost me mind a bit... The IVF, the work contracts, but... I shouldn't have pushed you away. Can you forgive me? 
 Why were you at the police station? What? 
 I checked your phone location on the app. 
 Oh... I lost it. My phone, they were holding it down there for me. 
 I know. I know. I know your fiancee is a crazy woman but, look... 
 I am cooking dinner. 
 Let's just... have a laugh... turn our minds off, talk all this stuff through another day. 
 What do you say? 
 (Atmospheric music plays) 
 Morning, boss. Morning! 
 (Phones ring) 
 (Knock on door) 
 Yeah? 
 I know... what's going on. 
 If it's bad news, just tell us. 
 The strategy was really simple. 
 We don't tell them until we get a new contract, so, which one of you two blabbermouths couldn't keep it quiet for half a week? Joe? 
 No. It was me. But thanks for making choice one. 
 A couple of the girls were talking, saying you seemed stressed out, so I kind of... hinted. You hinted? 
 Well, when I say hinted, I mean I told them exactly what had happened. Oh... 
 I told them to keep it quiet, though. Oh, right, you told them to keep it quiet... 
 Yeah, my bad. In Toke's defence, you have been behaving a bit odd, Jenna. 
 I mean, people have noticed how agitated you are. 
 Oh, right, so it's my fault? 
 No... No! 
 I'm sorry, Jenna. It was unprofessional. 
 If you want to give me a written warning then I won't put any... No. 
 No, no warnings. People make mistakes. 
 We all make mistakes. 
 How is he? They've sectioned him. 
 Risk's too high. 
 It was either that or the other option. 
 Ally, can I ask you something? 
 The men you go for, they're all kind of... troubled. 
 Do you think you can save them? 
 Are you just drawn to the drama of it all or...? Ray! I'm just saying. 
 You're a lovely girl and... Lovely-looking. 
 And you deserve someone who'll make you happy. 
 Thanks, Ray. 
 Oh, you mean... 
 I know I don't stand a chance. 
 I realise I'm lower league but I'm straightforward, I've got a good heart, spot of athlete's foot but no major mental issues. 
 Anyway, it's said now. It's out there. So... 
 Let's get back to work, shall we? 
 I'm not here to fight. 
 Yeah? What you here for? To talk. Like adults. 
 Like sisters. 
 I've been to see a solicitor. A good one, expensive. 
 And she reckons with the story told a certain way and with your criminal record, I could avoid jail. 
 But you... You're right, they'd slam you back inside. 
 So, that's what you came to tell me, then? 
 That you're sh1tting on me! I'm telling you what she advised. 
 She said that's what I have to do to get off. 
 I will take you down with me. 
 No. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 I'm a respectable businesswoman and you're not. 
 So, who are they going to believe? 
 Or... there's a third way. 
 Your fella came to see me, did he tell you? He wanted money. 50 grand. 
 For that, he told me he'd convince you to help me or he'd screw you over. 
 What is it that you see in guys like that, Liz? 
 You come out of prison and you... and you... reconnect with... a... a dick like Aaron? 
 Where's that going to lead you? Anywhere good? 
 I don't want you to go back inside. 
 I don't want you wasting any more of your life. 
 I'm your sister and I love you. 
 But that guy, he doesn't care about you and he'll drag you down. 
 And what's the third way? 
 We stick together. 
 We put the blame on him. The... 
 The solicitor said the police always want the dealer the most. 
 They will drop charges to nail the dealer. 
 It's just the way that it works. He'll deny it. 
 It'll be his word against ours. We implicate him. 
 They'll search his house like they searched mine. 
 And if they don't find anything? They will. Yeah? How do you know? 
 I've bought this gear. 
 I can't do that. 
 I can. 
 (Tense music plays) 
 (Muffled voices approach) 
 Lizzie : Just grab 'em and then let's go! 
 One minute, Liz, all right? 
 Aaron, hurry up, will ya? I'm coming, I just need a piss. 
 (He urinates) 
 Will you come on? All right! 
 (She breathes heavily) 
 Only say exactly what we agreed. 
 'There was a little girl. Her name was Emily.' 
 (Distorted piano plays, dog barks) 
 (Loud static interference) 
 Sorry, day from hell. Look at that. Slipped on a banana. 
 Not a skin, an actual banana some prick left on the floor. 
 Oh, wine, excellent... 
 Are you oké? 
 Jen, what are you doing? 
 I'm not the person that you think I am. 
 What you see in front of you, all of this... isn't who I really am. 
 All right, Jen, you're starting to scare me. 
 What are you talking about? Good evening... Not now! 
 Sorry... 
 Can we leave? Why are we here? 
 I grew up in care. 
 The mum that I've told you about, she isn't my real mum. 
 She... she isn't real. 
 I invented her. 
 My... real... mum... was a mess... 
 D'you know, no... I was being polite. 
 She was a fuck-up. 
 I come from scum. 
 And I've never admitted this to anyone but, erm... when I was little, my biggest fear was that I'd turn into her. 
 Cos I've got her genes. 
 And no matter what anybody did, I'd end up like her. 
 Someone who pisses their life away. That's not who you are. 
 I've got a sister. 
 A half-sister. Erm... 
 She's never been part of my life, not really, arm's length. 
 She's spent some time in prison. Prison? 
 She got out recently and I've been helping her out... with money and... seeing her now and again. You didn't tell me this because...? 
 I've done something really bad, Jake. 
 To save myself and to keep all of this. 
 But then I realised that... everything that you love is a lie and... you can't marry someone who you don't really know. 
 And you can't have children with someone that you don't really know. 
 What have you done? 
 Jenna! 
 Music : Teardrop by Massive Attack We need to change our lives. 
 And, then, when all this is over... we need to stop working so hard. 
 Stop... chasing whatever it is we think we need to make us a success. 
 So, IVF or the perfect family... I just want you. Jenna. 
 You, for who you are. 
 Nothing else matters.

 Right, he's here, he's here! He's coming! Shhh! 
 (Man clears throat) 
 (Stifled laughter) 
 (Man sniggers) 
 I'm rising above it. 
 We're not infants. This isn't a nursery. 
 And, trust me, you'll get bored a lot quicker than I will. 
 (Raucous laughter) 
 (He shrieks) 
 Right on my shoulder blade that was, yeah, very funny. 
 Right, that's it, I'm done. Right, I'm off. 
 I'm particularly disappointed in you, Ray. 
 Oh, come on! 
 I really mean it this time. I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone!
