 Previously on "Manifest" 828 wing nuts shouldn't be allowed to carry the badge and gun. 
  Adrian's making the rest of the world scared to death of us. 
  The rest of the world needs to open their eyes! 
  I was able to confirm elimination of the 828 anomaly in a Petri dish. 
  Now I need to test the serum on a living specimen. 
  The Calling said "save the passengers". 
  To me, that means tracking them down and finding out who knows something we don't. 
  The star represents hope. 
  The woman said it was what her future held. 
  She gave it to Olive. 
  How is this possible? 
  I don't have anywhere else to go. 
  Michaela, this is Courtney. 
  His wife. 
  Zeke? 
  Hey, man. 
  How you doing, man? 
  - Never better! 
  - Aah! 
  Must be love. 
  Just might be. 
  I got some new merchandise. 
  First two are on me. 
  I don't mean to scare you, but I think there's a girl in my bed. 
  Uh-oh. 
  I've heard they can be very, very dangerous. 
  I hope you brought her something to keep her happy. 
  Pink's my color. 
  Now, what are we gonna do today? 
  You've already chosen pink. 
  P-I-N-K. 
  Okay, what number? 
  You're crazy. 
  Um three. 
  Okay. 
  It says we should get married. 
  Ohh. 
  I'm just kidding. 
  It says, "Go to the movies". 
  Unless Unless we should just get married. 
  And we did. 
  We got married. 
  'Cause that's how we were back then wild, impulsive in love. 
  But this guy and I, we were also toxic together. 
  We fed each other's addictions. 
  But he finally found a path out of all of that. 
  He's sober, dating a police detective, happy. 
  And he's trying to help me find a path out, too. 
  You asked for it. 
  This is "a few things"? 
  Yeah, well, Grace has been spending a lot of time in the house lately. 
  Since the accident? 
  And apparently, waging a holy war on clutter. 
  - Hmm. 
  - If this is too much, I can No, I could always use three whisks. 
  You are now a proud owner of a slightly used air bed. 
  Actually, this is good. 
  It'll give Courtney a nice break from the couch. 
  Zeke just forget to mention he had a wife? 
  No, to be clear, they were high as kites, so they never actually filed the paperwork. 
  They were never legally married, and they broke up like a year before he went into the woods. 
  Oh. 
  Okay. 
  That doesn't make it weird at all that she's been on your couch for a week. 
  Look, Zeke dealt with my drama with Jared. 
  He carried it all the way to Rikers, so it's my turn. 
  I mean, part of his sobriety is making amends with the past, so he's helping her. 
  It's fine. 
  It's awful. 
  Look, I'm trying to be supportive, and she's actually really nice, but I just want her gone. 
  Well, I got some good news for you. 
  There's a hole in the air bed. 
  Alright. 
  Now you're even. 
  Yeah? 
  Can I look? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  How you feel? 
  Like a new man. 
  You know, I feel like an accessory to a crime. 
  Didn't you tell your dad we're doing tarot-card research today? 
  And we will. 
  You know, my mom used to volunteer at a soup kitchen. 
  There was this Buddhist Temple that had one in it. 
  Sometimes I'd go. 
  So, your mom was Buddhist? 
  She was a lot of things. 
  When I came back and she was gone, I, uh, had my own mini Buddhist memorial rite for her. 
  Did it help? 
  Kind of. 
  I could feel her. 
  It's an honor to have you here. 
  Oh. 
  Okay. 
  Where do we start? 
  - No. 
  - I No, no. 
  You have to go. 
  What? 
  Why? 
  Your dad was very clear. 
  'Cause you're a minor, I have to comply. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Okay. 
  If we're turning away the very people who experienced the miracle firsthand, how are we going to get the rest of the world to believe? 
  There'll be another miracle, Isaiah. 
  An even bigger one. 
  I Grace? 
  Good news. 
  Your whisks officially have a new home. 
  What is it? 
  Hi! 
  This is Jane Hawley of New York Life. 
  Our magazine is doing a cover feature on your pregnancy. 
  The first 828 baby is a big story, and we'd love to interview you for the article. 
  Call us back How did she find out? 
  So many people have seen us coming and going from the hospital. 
  I guess I guess we can't hide it anymore. 
  I don't want anyone else to know. 
  I don't want the Xers to know. 
  I don't want the Believers to know. 
  It's none of their business. 
  It's just two people having a baby. 
  There's no story here. 
  It's not like it's a plane coming back from the past. 
  Ben? 
  Great marriage pep talk. 
  Thank you. 
  Michaela! 
  That was really sweet of you. 
  You must be drunk. 
  Saanvi! 
  Saanvi! 
  Ben, please help! 
  You have to help! 
  Wait! 
  Wait, Saanvi! 
  Was that a Calling? 
  I think Saanvi's in trouble. 
  Is she still hiding out with Vance? 
  No, not anymore. 
  Even the former director of the NSA couldn't keep her from her research. 
  Go. 
  I'll stay here with Cal. 
  Just call me if you need anything. 
  Alright. 
  Hey, Captain. 
  Did you, um, hear from Internal Affairs about the leak? 
  Hey, Stone. 
  You get any proof there is a leak? 
  Someone tipped off the Xers right before that bust. 
  I have a feeling someone Do I strike you as someone who's interested in your feelings? 
  Stop pointing fingers and go catch a bad guy. 
  Goodbye. 
  Hey. 
  Sorry about that. 
  I do have a lead on an attempted burglary, though, if you want to - Go. 
  I got it. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  I got this. 
  Whoa! 
  What's up with the new do? 
  Where's she going without you? 
  Yeah. 
  Good luck. 
  Saanvi? 
  You in there? 
  Come on, open up. 
  Saanvi! 
  - Saanvi! 
  - Hey. 
  - Is she in there? 
  - I think so. 
  Her phone's in there. 
  Hey. 
  Excuse me. 
  Can we get this door open, please? 
  - Get a doctor right now! 
  - Right away! 
  Saanvi. 
  Hey. 
  Thanks. 
  You know, with the hours Saanvi's been keeping, she probably just collapsed from exhaustion. 
  I'm not so sure. 
  I swiped this from the floor next to her. 
  I've prepped myself, and I will begin Phase One of Human Trials. 
  She was experimenting on herself? 
  Why would she do that? 
  That's so dangerous. 
  She blames herself for the Major getting her research, and now she feels she has to catch up. 
  Well, she can't catch up if she's dead. 
  Excuse me. 
  Dr. 
  Bahl is going to be fine, but she's very lucky you found her when you did. 
  You'll be able to see her in a few minutes. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Thank you. 
  I got to go. 
  Can you let me know how she is? 
  Yeah. 
  Okay, so, most versions of the Star Card show a woman at a river. 
  This one has a peacock. 
  And a peacock is what helped you figure out the Death Date. 
  - Yeah. 
  - So, why would the tarot reader give you and your mom a card in the first place? 
  Wouldn't that make the deck incomplete? 
  I supposed you would have to ask the reader who gave it to us, but I don't know her name, nor do I know the name of her business. 
  It was literally a stand on the sidewalk. 
  We could go look for her. 
  Field trip. 
  Let's do it. 
  It's kinda hard to stay mad at you since you may just have saved my life. 
  Well then I'll be mad at you. 
  You were testing on yourself? 
  Saanvi, you were the one that told me that testing on people is unethical and it would never be considered unless the patient is terminal. 
  We are terminal. 
  That's what I'm working on, Ben. 
  If there's a chance to cure the Death Date, I have to figure it out. 
  That is on me. 
  And how are you gonna do that if you're dead and buried? 
  You know what, Saanvi? 
  You've got to promise me you're not gonna test on yourself again. 
  - I'll try, but - No. 
  Promise me. 
  Saanvi, if we hadn't had that Calling, if you hadn't asked me to help you, I Wait. 
  In the Calling, I wasn't asking you to help me. 
  You didn't see the boy? 
  Hey, are you okay? 
  Hey, can you hear me? 
  Where are your parents? 
  Help. 
  Help. 
  Saanvi! 
  Saanvi! 
  Help! 
  Help! 
  You have to help, Ben! 
  No, no. 
  Saanvi! 
  Wait! 
  That must have been right as I was passing out from the hypoxia. 
  Which explains why you faded away in the Calling. 
  I-I did see the kid but only for a few seconds after you disappeared. 
  But Cal was the youngest kid on 828. 
  We both saw him. 
  Okay, so it was 14C. 
  That was Finn Nowak. 
  - Wall Street guy. 
  - We need to talk to Finn. 
  That little boy desperately needs our help. 
  We have to find him. 
  You are a patient here who's not been discharged. 
  - I go talk to Finn. 
  - Well, keep me in the loop. 
  Hey. 
  You memorized the seating chart? 
  Are you surprised? 
  No, I'm impressed. 
  I-I It was over there. 
  It was under a black tent. 
  But I don't know. 
  It's been three years. 
  I can't remember. 
  Yeah, tell me about it. 
  I came here last year with a classmate. 
  She's 25 now. 
  Was she your girlfriend? 
  I don't really have too many friends, much less girlfriends. 
  Not that I wouldn't want a girlfriend. 
  And, you know, it's, uh It'd be different if I, you know, met the right person. 
  - No. 
  Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Exactly. 
  You just You just haven't met the right person yet. 
  I mean, I haven't not met that person. 
  It's just not too many people know what it's like to be an 828er. 
  Yeah. 
  I bet. 
  It's complicated. 
  Yeah. 
  Just a bit. 
  Is that it? 
  Not even close, but let's just see if she knows anything. 
  Great. 
  Vision of being back on the plane? 
  No. 
  No, I haven't had anything like that. 
  So, you wouldn't know why we saw a kid in your seat? 
  Probably 5 or 6, dark hair, dark eyes. 
  No idea. 
  I don't have a wife, no kids, so Definitely didn't bring one to Jamaica. 
  I was there for a bachelor party. 
  The funny thing is, I wasn't even supposed to be on that plane. 
  Yeah, me neither. 
  Last-minute voucher grab. 
  What's your story? 
  We went to this beach party the night before, and I met this amazing woman, Orlena. 
  Smart, funny. 
  New Yorker. 
  We just connected. 
  Next morning, she was gone. 
  I went looking for her, and I missed my plane. 
  - I ended up on 828. 
  - That one little decision. 
  Screwed up pretty much everything. 
  Yeah. 
  That's him. 
  That's the kid who was on the plane in your seat. 
  That's impossible. 
  That's a childhood photo of me. 
  Zeke! 
  Who did this? 
  Same people who did that to Courtney. 
  What the hell happened? 
  Hi. 
  Excuse me. 
  Um, do you know about a tarot-card reader here about three years ago? 
  Sorry, I don't do missing persons. 
  Okay, then can you tell us about this? 
  It's a Star Card from the Major Arcana. 
  Corresponding to Aquarius and Air Elements. 
  Okay, uh, but can you tell us the deck where that card came from? 
  Yeah. 
  I know this deck. 
  Uh It's called the Alzeraz deck, I think. 
  Stunning artwork. 
  Alzeraz. 
  Okay, that's something. 
  - Okay, there's nothing on Amazon or eBay. 
  - Oh, no, no, no. 
  This deck has been out of print for decades. 
  I do know a few places in New York that sell rare and out-of-print things, if you have some time to dig around. 
  So, this has something to do with Finn's childhood? 
  Young Finn shows up in a Calling and asks for help? 
  No, that can't be right. 
  Let me, um, see his photo again. 
  Here. 
  Maybe it's not the same kid. 
  Just a strong family resemblance. 
  He said he didn't have any kids. 
  Unless Finn said he had a one-night stand the night before he left Jamaica. 
  And the kid would be 5, which seems about the same age as the kid that we saw in the Calling. 
  What do you know about the one-night stand? 
  Oh, not much. 
  He remembered her name. 
  It was, um, Orlena from New York. 
  And we also know a due date 40 weeks after April 7, 2013. 
  If we try to find all the There were only three Orlenas that gave birth that year in New York two in the spring and Orlena Prager that gave birth to a baby boy November 30, 2013. 
  Named him Theo. 
  Surprised? 
  Impressed. 
  So, what does Theo need from us? 
  I don't know. 
  Let's go talk to Orlena. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I didn't come here just to get sober. 
  I came here because I thought Lucas wouldn't be able to find me. 
  Who's Lucas? 
  He's a dealer. 
  I owe him money. 
  I thought I could pay it back little by little. 
  How much? 
  $20,000. 
  Jesus, Court! 
  I know. 
  I didn't think he'd be able to find me here, but his guys followed me. 
  They were just passing along a message. 
  Which was what? 
  That I work for Lucas now. 
  No way. 
  Absolutely not. 
  Really? 
  Do you have an extra 20K just lying around? 
  Because I don't. 
  I'm stuck. 
  If I don't go work for Lucas, he's gonna have me killed. 
  Hey. 
  Are you sure you're okay? 
  Yeah. 
  I should have come without you. 
  We both had the Callings. 
  We're supposed to do it together. 
  I hope we're right about this. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Saanvi Bahl. 
  - This is Ben Stone. 
  - Hi. 
  We wanted to talk to you about your son Theo. 
  We're hoping we can help in some way. 
  In what way? 
  We're not exactly sure. 
  Do you remember Finn Nowak? 
  Come on, kids. 
  Grab some groceries. 
  You should go. 
  Let's see who brings the bag with the special treat. 
  Please, I-I have nothing to say. 
  Mrs. 
  Prager, we know that you had a son less than a year after you took a trip to Jamaica. 
  Those are my three children. 
  And that man is my husband of 10 years, and he's their father. 
  And he's a good father. 
  Please, just go. 
  Now what do we do? 
  I don't know, but the husband's not Theo's father. 
  Still, I don't get the Calling. 
  Theo looks fine. 
  I saw terror in that child's eyes on the plane. 
  We have to help him. 
  Okay, this is something. 
  - Tell me what you got. 
  - It's not Alzeraz. 
  It's the "Al-Zuras Deck", created by Yusuv Al-Zuras, a 16th-century Egyptian scholar and artist. 
  Yusuv Al-Zuras. 
  Scholar, traveled around Europe. 
  Whoa. 
  What? 
  Uh, according to legend, he was lost at sea for 10 years and mysteriously returned. 
  Really? 
  That sounds familiar. 
  Yeah. 
  "Upon returning, he claimed he could" What? 
  What is it? 
  "Upon returning, he claimed he could hear the voice of God in his head". 
  Does this mean it's happened before? 
  I don't know. 
  Okay, it doesn't say when he died, but I'm assuming it's 10 years after he returned? 
  Which means the Calling led us to Al-Zuras to show that the Death Date was real. 
  Okay, well, we have no idea when this guy died. 
  For For all we know, he could have lived another 30 years. 
  Hey, maybe the Calling led us to this guy because he survived the Death Date. 
  Yeah. 
  You know what you need? 
  A tarot reading. 
  Oh. 
  This See the man in the jeggings? 
  It's Emo Drake. 
  And he's doing a slow jam with a mandolin. 
  And if I'm reading the cards right, they say it's your favorite kind of music. 
  Yeah, but it is - Mm. 
  - not. 
  And I'm pretty sure that's a lute. 
  Uh, now, you see this card. 
  This is a glowing path, illuminating the way to true love. 
  Yeah, that just looks so much like a volcano and some lava. 
  But whatever you say. 
  What about the third card? 
  The heart and the crown? 
  It's a strawberry. 
  And that is a fancy pie pan. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Which means you're gonna have a very fancy strawberry pie in your future. 
  You, sir, have a bright, shining, and, uh, very lucky future. 
  Yeah. 
  You're right. 
  I am lucky. 
  Thanks. 
  I don't get you. 
  How many women would let their boyfriend's junkie ex stay with them? 
  I'm a big believer in second chances. 
  Zeke said that, that you were the biggest part of his recovery. 
  No, no, Zeke wanted to get sober on his own. 
  - It had nothing to do with me. 
  - I don't know. 
  I've seen Zeke try to get clean plenty of times. 
  We'd swear we were gonna stop using, but he always had a backup plan. 
  He'd stash a couple pills in a sock drawer, the barrel of his razor, dryer sheets. 
  But with you, he seems pretty determined. 
  We all have a limited time on Earth. 
  And I think that he's just trying to live an honest life. 
  Is it okay if I take a shower? 
  I need to get the feeling of their hands off me. 
  Of course. 
  Yeah. 
  Okay, cool, man. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  No, I'll see you. 
  Okay, I'll be there soon. 
  Alright. 
  Bye. 
  Who was that? 
  Lucas. 
  I'm going to deal with this. 
  Zeke, no. 
  Part of making amends is not endangering yourself. 
  How do you know she's not just gonna buy from someone else? 
  I don't. 
  But I do know I turned my back on my sister when she needed me the most. 
  I won't do that again. 
  I'm coming with you. 
  I'm the one who needs to make amends, not you. 
  - I'm keeping you out of this. 
  - It's not up to you. 
  We're supposed to do this together. 
  You had a Calling. 
  Snowflakes. 
  Just like right before we found you. 
  Old-school. 
  Lucas is a really scary guy, Mick. 
  Yeah, and I'm a cop. 
  Once Lucas takes the money and we get the pills, I'll signal you, okay? 
  You sure you don't want to requisition some high-tech gear from one room over? 
  I mean, this is basically a Dixie cup on a string. 
  I still think there's a leak. 
  I don't want to risk it. 
  Alright. 
  Got it. 
  Dixie cups it is. 
  I have a son. 
  A son. 
  I just I've missed five birthdays. 
  It's not your fault. 
  I have to make it up to him. 
  No, I want to. 
  I'm his father. 
  Actually, when you met Orlena, she was she was married. 
  I never would have That wasn't your fault, either. 
  You didn't know. 
  And the guy has no idea that Theo isn't his? 
  It seems that way. 
  Orlena was pretty clear that her husband is a very involved, very loving father. 
  But I can insist on visits, right? 
  Legally, yes. 
  But you'd be risking blowing up a happy family. 
  I don't want to do that. 
  But I should get to meet Theo. 
  Just once. 
  Do you think you can make that happen? 
  Are you sure? 
  Because as a father, I have to say I think it'd be harder to walk away than you think. 
  Okay, we'll try. 
  I mean, we have to try. 
  The Callings were clear. 
  Theo needs our help. 
  And maybe that means he needs your help, too. 
  Hey, Zeke! 
  it's been forever! 
  So, where you been hiding? 
  Uh, in a cave. 
  I believe it. 
  Well, the parties haven't been the same without you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Where are my manners? 
 
 
 
  - I'm Lucas. 
  - Ella. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  - Very nice to meet you. 
  Sit down, Ella. 
  Pour it down his throat So, you spoke to Courtney. 
  Yeah. 
  She says she's in bad with you right now. 
  - Are you surprised? 
  - No. 
  I'll buy at over market value, sell half, give you a cut, repay Courtney's debt within a week. 
  That girl still has got you under her spell, doesn't she? 
  and an inhaler - No offense. 
  - None taken. 
  Those two were crazy. 
  I mean, Court was off the hook. 
  That girl liked to party. 
  What about you, Ella? 
  You like to party? 
  Well, I'm not just here for the '90s decor. 
  Well, I'm glad to hear that. 
  See, I know Zeke, and I trust him. 
  But I don't know you. 
  So, let's consider this sort of a trust exercise. 
  What are you talking about? 
  She's gonna need to shoot up before anything goes down. 
  Ain't gonna wait for tomorrow You know you never should Do you think any of this has to do with the Death Date? 
  Why would you say that? 
  I don't know. 
  'Cause it's better than thinking the Callings are just toying with us. 
  I think we're supposed to just help Theo. 
  How's this help him? 
  I mean, Finn sees him once, then what? 
  I don't know. 
  Hey. 
  Is she here? 
  My God, you look exactly the same. 
  It's just this one meeting, right? 
  Then I'll leave, if that's what Theo needs. 
  It is. 
  Theo. 
  Theo, come here for a sec. 
  I want you to meet some friends. 
  This is Ben and Saanvi, and this is Finn. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  It's so nice to meet you. 
  I like your rock. 
  It's not a rock. 
  It's a very still frog. 
  It's very still. 
  Can I tell you a secret? 
  Sure. 
  It's actually a rock. 
  Can we go in there to see the dinosaurs, please? 
  Yes, we can. 
  In a minute. 
  - Okay. 
  - Bye. 
  Has Theo always had dark eyes? 
  No yellow circles? 
  Nope. 
  He has my eyes. 
  Hey, you okay, chiquito? 
  I'm fine. 
  He's He's been tired lately. 
  - We should go. 
  - Wait. 
  Already? 
  But I barely Look, maybe I could just be his friend, you know? 
  Send some gifts or something, money? 
  I don't need anything, and neither does Theo. 
  Hey, guys. 
  You ready to go, huh? 
  Did you fall too hard? 
  Did you fall pretty hard? 
  Theo's having motor issues. 
  And in the Callings, his eyes were different. 
  They had distinctive yellow rings, which is a sign of liver disease. 
  And you don't get that until you're crashing. 
  That's what the Calling wanted us to figure out. 
  Has he seemed disoriented lately? 
  Has he fallen asleep at odd times? 
  - How'd you know that? 
  - Orlena, listen to me. 
  I am a doctor, and we need to get Theo to a hospital. 
  Now. 
  She's not a needle girl. 
  Too uptight. 
  Pills only. 
  But I'm happy to take it. 
  Are you kidding me? 
  I'm too uptight? 
  Courtney wasn't too uptight, right? 
  Courtney, who apparently still has you under her spell? 
  Look, I told you we should've gone to Colorado. 
  - This guy sucks. 
  - What did you say to me? 
  Alright, back off. 
  This guy and I have been through a lot together. 
  Plus his prices are way better. 
  No, we're paying over market value 'cause your ex is a junkie! 
  At least she was fun to be around! 
  Whoa! 
  Okay. 
  Duncan. 
  Let's finish this transaction, then you two can take your drama and go away. 
  I know you. 
  No, I don't think so. 
  Nah, y-you're an 828er. 
  And you're a cop. 
  You know, I gotta say, Zeke, I'm disappointed. 
  And I hope you know this means I'm revoking your VIP status. 
  It's okay. 
  I don't like hanging out with with guys who beat up women. 
  I don't beat up women. 
  I get my guys to do that. 
  But in this case, I might make an exception. 
  Hey! 
  NYPD. 
  Weapons down. 
  You're a dead man. 
  Yeah. 
  I already know that. 
  Come on. 
  Dr. 
  Bahl, heard you had an amazing catch with this pediatric liver case. 
  He's not out of the woods yet. 
  He needs a transplant. 
  We are still waiting to see if his parents are a match. 
  Well, it's rare that this disorder shows up in someone his age. 
  He's lucky you caught it. 
  Saanvi? 
  How'd it go? 
  I'm not a match. 
  They said they'd put him on a list, but that could take weeks. 
  Then they started talking about his odds, and I We need to ask Finn. 
  Okay, he has as much of a chance of matching as you did. 
  I know. 
  I will. 
  I just can't imagine how, after the way Actually, you might not have to. 
  They say I'm a perfect match. 
  And you'll ? 
  I told you I wanted to give something to my son. 
  Now I can. 
  Part of my liver. 
  I didn't need the whole thing anyway. 
  Don't worry. 
  It'll be an anonymous donation. 
  You don't have to change your life or Theo's. 
  No. 
  You're saving his life. 
  You deserve to be part of it. 
  Thank you for convincing him. 
  I didn't need to. 
  Finn agreed right away. 
  He's a good guy. 
  Nice shot. 
  I got winner. 
  Eh I don't know. 
  I've done a little digging. 
  What are you talking about? 
  Turns out you were engaged to an 828er. 
  Michaela Stone? 
  I'm onto you. 
  Don't come back here. 
  Stay away from Tamara, too. 
  Alright. 
  You want to know about me? 
  How I ended up here? 
  I'm happy to share. 
  You're right. 
  I do know Michaela Stone. 
  And, yeah, yeah, we were gonna get married. 
  Then she went to Jamaica. 
  I swear to God she died on that plane. 
  Because 5 and a half years later, whoever came back, hell, whatever came back, see, that wasn't her. 
  This person destroyed my marriage, and then she threw me under the bus in open court to protect some drug addict she barely knows. 
  Which destroyed everything that I have worked for. 
  Yeah, Billy, you want to know why I'm here? 
  It's because Michaela Stone destroyed my life. 
  My entire life. 
  Well, then let's get another round. 
  This changes everything. 
  I mean, the possibility that all of this has happened before, it's it's huge. 
  I am so impressed that you and TJ managed to track it all down. 
  So TJ just said he figured something else out about the tarot, so can I go meet him? 
  Dad, if you're worried that I'm gonna go to the church and poison my impressionable mind, I'm not. 
  Okay? 
  Please understand me. 
  You know us. 
  Other people don't. 
  They listen to Adrian calling us immortals, that we're miracles, but what they hear is we're not human. 
  And that's incredibly dangerous for all of us. 
  I know, okay? 
  You've made that very clear. 
  Can I go now? 
  Yes. 
  Don't worry. 
  You can track my phone. 
  Oh, I am. 
  And I'm tracking his, too. 
  You're the worst. 
  Love you. 
  Courtney? 
  - She's gone. 
  - How do you know? 
  'Cause that's what Courtney does upends your life and then disappears. 
  Except maybe it's okay because it looks like she decided to "move into sober house". 
  Do you think she actually went? 
  It's up to her. 
  But I've made my amends. 
  I can't live her life for her. 
  I can only live mine. 
  And I really like this life. 
  I was thinking maybe maybe we should do the story. 
  Grace, I thought we agreed to keep the pregnancy to ourselves? 
  I mean, if the Xers found out, it That's what I've been thinking about. 
  But then you told me about Orlena. 
  What does she have to do with this? 
  For five years, she convinced people that her son Theo was her husband's and not a passenger's. 
  And so that got me thinking maybe we could convince people that our baby girl is not an 828 baby. 
  I-I'm sorry. 
  W-What are you saying? 
  We could We could tell people she's Danny's. 
  - What? 
  - I'm sure Danny would go along with it. 
  Two different Callings have warned us that the baby might be in danger. 
  I'm scared. 
  I am, too. 
  I'm terrified. 
  It was just an idea. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I will protect our baby. 
  We both will. 
  Together. 
  There you are. 
  Are you okay? 
  You were right. 
  The tarot. 
  What are you talking about? 
  The illuminated path. 
  Just like the card said. 
  It's glowing lava. 
  Well, they're LEDs. 
  The tarot was a little concerned about burning down Central Park. 
  But as it turns out, just like Emo Drake here, I, too, am kind of a fan of mandolin music. 
  Oh? 
  Are you sure that's not a lute? 
  I'm not. 
  But, look, the final card. 
  It's a fancy strawberry pie. 
  The tarot could have been a little bit more specific on the difference between baking soda and powder. 
  But it's what we got. 
  Well it's perfect. 
  Theoretically, the genetic anomaly could transfer to Finn's son by way of the organ transplant, meaning we may have just saved this kid and cursed him at the same time. 
  Ben, if you find this, I know I promised, but I also know that there was no other way. 
  I have to test on myself. 
  I have to save the passengers. 
  Ash. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Is this what happened to us? 
  Ben, did we crash? 
  These people, they weren't on the plane. 
  Some of them were. 
  What the hell's happening
