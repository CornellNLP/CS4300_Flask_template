 Previously on "Manifest" No one's ever done anything like that for me. 
  Professor Stone, Simon White. 
  We're delighted you're considering us. 
  I'm glad to be here. 
  "Welcome to my parlor", said the spider to the fly. 
  Coincidence you've been eating here so much during my shifts? 
  Just ask me out for dinner already. 
  Ben, you're not giving up. 
  I haven't found a new clue in over a month. 
  My dad's a great guy, but he gets obsessed. 
  We need to approach this from a place of hope. 
  Believe in the miracle of Flight 828. 
  Believe in the passengers. 
  If I don't get what I need from that box, I'm gonna die. 
  He seems to think that whatever's in that vault is gonna save him. 
  So maybe it'll save us, too. 
  My portion of the Death Date Calling was a peacock. 
  It was the first step in understanding we were going to die. 
  All I've got is eight months. 
  We will find a way to really save you. 
  But you already have. 
  You love the carousel. 
  What's wrong, Olive? 
  I had another dream. 
  Cal was talking to me. 
  I think it's a sign. 
  Of course it's a sign, honey. 
  It's a sign that you loved your brother and he loved you. 
  It's more than that. 
  I know he's not dead. 
  They're out there. 
  Ollie, honey, we just talked about this in therapy. 
  It's been two years. 
  It's time for us to move on, both of us. 
  Excuse me! 
  Would you like a reading? 
  Oh, no, thank you. 
  Can we, Mom? 
  Please? 
  Olive these things are a scam. 
  It's a waste of money. 
  Come on. 
  Please. 
  Just in case. 
  Alright. 
  Fine. 
  Your father would kill me. 
  Hello. 
  Hi. 
  So, how's this work? 
  Shuffle. 
  And let the cards soak in your true self. 
  - I'm so happy! 
  - Whoo-hoo-hoo! 
  I see you've been lonely 'cause you lost someone who completed you. 
  Always look to the future with a possibility that everything will turn out well. 
  We need to order more paper cups. 
  Oh, Isaiah, more are arriving on Tuesday. 
  How did we do anything around here before you joined us? 
  Well, don't tell my parents, or they'll add more to my chores. 
  It's not like they come here, anyway. 
  Well, what's it like living among the Returned? 
  Not as glorious as you Stay here. 
  Call Adrian. 
  Hey! 
  Hey! 
  Hey! 
  Stop it! 
  This is a place of worship! 
  Please leave your message. 
  Go! 
  You don't sleep much, do you? 
  I didn't mean to wake you. 
  I didn't. 
  I wouldn't. 
  No, no, it's fine. 
  Um, I should have gotten rid of these. 
  You're not the addict. 
  It's not your problem. 
  I know, but I can make it easier for you. 
  It doesn't get any easier. 
  It just At least now I have a reason to be strong. 
  We both do. 
  And my alarm doesn't go off for half an hour, so So, first, you tell me I have a Death Date, and now some magic compass your sister found in a safe-deposit box is gonna be the way we avoid it. 
  Can we not use the word "magic", please? 
  It's a built-in excuse not to look for an explanation. 
  Well, as long as it can save us, I don't care what we call it. 
  Those engravings They're not part of the original design. 
  The weird star in the peacock? 
  The peacock was part of the Death Date Calling. 
  So, who engraved it, and why? 
  - Hey! 
  - Hey. 
  Have you heard what happened at that church? 
  No. 
  How do you explain the things that keep happening? 
  Two of these so-called Passengers hijacked a plane. 
  One started a church. 
  Another one just robbed a bank. 
  There are almost 100 of them living in New York, and naturally, the public is scared, which leads us to this unfortunate event. 
  This is never gonna end. 
  You guys just can't escape the spotlight. 
  Not all it's cracked up to be. 
  I can't say I'm surprised. 
  I mean, when is Adrian gonna realize he's just fueling the fire? 
  And putting a target on all our backs. 
  The group's engendered criticism since one of the Passengers became their leader. 
  Save her. 
  We're reporting on the latest on the Flight 828 Passengers, and we'll continue updating you as we I There were four guys. 
  Um, I ran off. 
  I pulled the alarm. 
  Is Isaiah okay? 
  I'm sorry. 
  I bolted. 
  I freaked out when I heard the sirens. 
  Isaiah will be fine, thanks to you. 
  You'll leave me out of it, when you give the police the description? 
  My My parents If they found out I come to the church, they'd never understand. 
  No one needs to know you were there. 
  I got you. 
  But you need to let go of the fear. 
  That's your parents talking, not you. 
  You've already embraced hope. 
  How can I help Isaiah? 
  Find something a prayer, a favorite poem. 
  Let your strength be a beacon to others. 
  Mm. 
  Let me give you a hand. 
  Way to ruin my workout. 
  You're really not good at casual, are you? 
  What, so, now I have to I got to apologize for my mama raising me right? 
  Man, why do I always end up with the mama's boys? 
  What was she like? 
  Your mother. 
  Hey, Tam. 
  I'm taking the Buick. 
  Like hell you are. 
  Last time, it took me a month to get the smell out. 
  You're becoming a fixture around here, aren't you? 
  Best breakfast around. 
  Breakfast is for regulars. 
  Keep it up, and you're gonna find yourself right off the list. 
  You want a ride, Billy? 
  I could have one of my squad cars come by and pick you up. 
  Okay, aren't you, uh, late meeting up with your loser friends? 
  You're one to talk? 
  Your brother's a real prince. 
  He's not a bad kid. 
  He just fell in with the wrong crowd. 
  Kids who fall into the wrong crowd tend to become bad kids. 
  What about guys who hang out with sassy bartenders? 
  What do they end up as? 
  I don't know. 
  Regulars? 
  Hmm. 
  Bowers really is pissed. 
  Stuck us with vandalism? 
  And assault. 
  I requested it. 
  Any excuse to get out of the precinct, huh? 
  If the Xers are willing to vandalize a church in broad daylight, who knows how far they're willing to go? 
  You worried about your family? 
  The only way to stop a bully is to punch him in the face. 
  Well, someone's ready to eat the world. 
  Let's just say I'm riding a hot streak. 
  What do we got? 
  Perfect one for you, Stone. 
  Straight-up dead end. 
  No witnesses, no leads. 
  Maybe you can use one of your anonymous tips. 
  Church doesn't have any security cameras? 
  They want to keep what they do here on the DL, if you ask me. 
  Where's the Vic? 
  In back with the paramedics. 
  Have fun with this one. 
  Lazy ass. 
  Well, let's just piss her off by solving it. 
  So, according to Twitter, there was only one victim from today's attack, but it was a man. 
  The Calling said, "Save her". 
  Who is "her"? 
  You sure it had to do with what happened at the Believers? 
  The only thing I'm sure of is somebody needs my help. 
  It's Grace. 
  I'll give you two some privacy. 
  I'm gonna head down to the library, see what I can find on this art history book. 
  - Okay. 
  Hey. 
  - Hi, honey. 
  Cal and I are hoping you could pick up some DeAngelo's for dinner. 
  Make sure he gets a Hawaiian. 
  Pineapples do not belong on pizza. 
  Ben? 
  Uh, yeah. 
  Sorry. 
  I had a Calling this morning. 
  "Save her". 
  You or Cal feel anything? 
  No, nothing here. 
  Save who? 
  I don't know. 
  But I got a bad feeling about this. 
  Did you talk to your sister? 
  Yeah, she's working a case, so I haven't been able - Mom! 
  - What the ?! 
  Grace? 
  Grace?! 
  It all happened so fast. 
  I By the time I got my bearings, they were gone. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It's It's all kind of a blur. 
  Grace! 
  We're okay. 
  I heard the impact. 
  What happened? 
  I-It was a blue truck. 
  They didn't even try to stop. 
  They hit you on purpose? 
  I don't know. 
  They were speeding. 
  I tried to get out of the way. 
  But Driver was probably texting. 
  It happens all the time. 
  They side-swipe them and just take off? 
  Probably uninsured. 
  We'll keep an eye out. 
  There's got to be witnesses, traffic cameras. 
  A truck like that doesn't just disappear into thin air. 
  Your insurance company can request Hey, buddy, can you just take this a little more seriously? 
  Look, my sister's a cop in the 12 Ben. 
  I think there's something wrong with the baby. 
  Sorry. 
  I didn't get a good look. 
  So, you said that you were in here, and then you heard a noise and went out there to investigate? 
  But you didn't get a good look. 
  Were their faces covered? 
  No. 
  Isaiah, we've met before. 
  Do you remember that? 
  Of course I do. 
  You're one of the Returned. 
  You You saved me. 
  Look, I know that you're scared, but you are safe now. 
  We will protect you. 
  I'm not scared. 
  I didn't see them. 
  These men, they are dangerous, and we can't catch them unless you help us. 
  Who pulled the fire alarm? 
  - Did they get a better look? 
  - I don't know. 
  Don't you want to see the people who did this to you, to your church, punished? 
  It is not my place to judge. 
  Their eyes will be opened in time. 
  I'll be right back. 
  Adrian. 
  What did you say to Isaiah? 
  Why won't he talk to us? 
  Michaela, it's not like I have some superpower. 
  These people can speak to you about anything they want. 
  And yet, they won't. 
  You do realize that if we don't catch these people, the attacks are just going to get worse. 
  Have you considered that arresting them may make things worse? 
  Especially if you're the one who does it. 
  If I do nothing, then I might be next, or my family or you. 
  Today was baseball bats. 
  Tomorrow might be guns. 
  Do you see where that's going? 
  I believe in Gandhi's path. 
  The minute we move to the offensive, we become a force to be feared. 
  Then sympathy evaporates. 
  So, this is a PR campaign? 
  This is about instilling hope. 
  To what end, though? 
  People are getting hurt. 
  To a world that understands and embraces us as a miracle. 
  Embraces you. 
  Donates to you. 
  That's what you're all about, isn't it? 
  Okay. 
  There we go. 
  That's a strong heartbeat. 
  So, everything's okay? 
  Um, she appears to be fine. 
  Uh Oh, my goodness. 
  Did I just Were you not finding out? 
  Not really. 
  It's a girl. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Don't be. 
  Ohh. 
  Doctor, we're in the clear, right? 
  I'd like to run some tests, make sure there's no placental abruption. 
  Oh, my God. 
  There's no cause for alarm. 
  We'll just keep you here for a few hours, monitor the baby. 
  Okay? 
  I'll be right back. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Through thick and thin. 
  "Save her". 
  Your Calling. 
  The baby? 
  I was a wreck, you know? 
  Was hopeless and powerless. 
  Alone. 
  Which I deserved. 
  But now I've found someone who believes in me and who has accepted me with open arms. 
  But I feel like a fraud, you know? 
  'Cause I'm still tempted. 
  When I was first in recovery, I also struggled with relationships. 
  I finally realized that I had to feel comfortable with myself before I could be comfortable with someone else. 
  I'm trying. 
  It's just It's not easy. 
  A big part of that was seeking forgiveness from the people I hurt while I was using. 
  I know, but How can we start something new with the past hanging over our heads? 
  When you're ready, the next step is to make amends. 
  I don't know if the people I hurt will ever forgive me. 
  I don't know if they should. 
  It's not about them. 
  It's about you. 
  And moving on. 
  Taking stock of how far you've come and seeing yourself as someone worthy of being loved. 
  Okay. 
  Ben. 
  Oh, finally. 
  What took you so long? 
  Sorry. 
  I got here as quick as I could. 
  How's Grace and Cal? 
  Cal's okay. 
  Shaken, but okay. 
  Dad took him for ice cream. 
  Grace is putting on her brave face. 
  They're still running tests on the baby. 
  It's a girl. 
  She's going to be okay. 
  Okay? 
  I can feel it. 
  Ohh, every every time Adrian does another sermon or some idiot goes on TV and invokes 828, these attacks ramp up. 
  It's just gonna get worse. 
  There is still a chance that it was an accident. 
  It wasn't. 
  I had another Calling. 
  "Save her". 
  Grace and Cal and the baby were targeted because of 828. 
  Now how am I supposed to save the passengers when I can't even protect my own family? 
  Ben, it's not all on you, okay? 
  I'm going after the Xers. 
  Vance is tracking down the Major. 
  Saanvi She's She's getting close to the Death Date. 
  Yeah, I'm starting to worry we're not gonna make it that far. 
  Ben, you can't think that way. 
  Mick, I need all the reports that the NYPD has on violence against passengers. 
  There may be some mention of a blue truck or what That is a long shot. 
  There is a lot of incidents. 
  I can't just sit here and do nothing. 
  Mick, please. 
  Okay, I'll send them your way. 
  Thank you. 
  I got to go. 
  Just give Grace my love. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  So, we pulled this footage from an ATM a couple doors down from the church. 
  The perps stopped for cash? 
  No, not quite. 
  But check this out. 
  Hello, good sir. 
  What's he so afraid of? 
  Just watch. 
  Three guys with baseball bats. 
  Hmm. 
  These feel like our suspects. 
  Yeah, and we got ourselves a witness. 
  Nice work. 
  Get a patrol unit to pull him in, - see what he knows. 
  - Alright. 
  I didn't realize there have been so many complaints by passengers. 
  Mom! 
  What happened? 
  Uh, some idiot hit us. 
  Your dad thinks it may have been deliberate. 
  The Calling. 
  Why would it warn me if there was nothing I could do about it? 
  The important thing is we're okay I think. 
  They just need to check on the baby. 
  Your baby sister. 
  Well, is she okay? 
  We think so. 
  We'll know soon. 
  How are you not freaking out? 
  Moms are superheroes. 
  Hmm. 
  Sweet of you to come, TJ. 
  Of course. 
  You doing research? 
  Maybe I can take over for a bit. 
  Uh, Michaela sent over police reports on attacks against passengers. 
  And in every instance, no witnesses, no evidence. 
  Like what happened today with the Believers Mick says no one will talk. 
  Maybe people are scared to talk. 
  Yeah, maybe. 
  In the meantime, your mom's lying in a hospital bed. 
  Do you really think it was related? 
  I just don't think it. 
  I'm gonna prove it. 
  See this? 
  Precinct. 
  Yeah, he's here. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Hopefully. 
  How's the, uh How's the case load? 
  Pretty thin, ever since my name came out in an open court as a rule-breaking obsessive detective. 
  Captain hasn't exactly been throwing high-profile cases my way. 
  Look, I don't expect you to understand about Zeke, but I didn't know what else to do. 
  Other than throw my name under the bus? 
  Look, it's okay. 
  I've moved on. 
  Good. 
  Maybe you can let the rest of the precinct know. 
  It's hard enough being an 828er without having to go up against the blue wall, so I think that's all in your head, Mick. 
  Do you? 
  An Xer beat the hell out of an 828 Believer, and the responding officer treated it like a joke. 
  I'm interviewing a suspect now. 
  Meantime, someone else ran Grace and Cal off the road, and the uni gave Ben a bunch of attitude. 
  Is everyone okay? 
  The baby might not be. 
  They're waiting to find out. 
  I'm sorry. 
  The point is Xers are hunting us. 
  Michaela, the Xers are a bunch of angry mouth breathers. 
  Don't you think you're giving them way too much credit? 
  I am telling you if someone doesn't start taking this seriously and shut them down, the next 828 victim is gonna end up dead. 
  It might be me. 
  It might be Ben. 
  It might be Cal. 
  But, no, yeah, you're right. 
  It's It's probably all in my head. 
  Look, I didn't see anything. 
  Well, you seemed to be in a pretty big hurry to get out of there. 
  I was late. 
  Is that a crime? 
  We got all day. 
  What got you so scared, Walter? 
  What? 
  You just see dudes coming down the street like that, - you get out of the way. 
  - So, you do remember something, then? 
  'Cause you're the only one here in this photo. 
  So, what? 
  So, what do they look like? 
  Like, I don't know, regular guys in hoodies. 
  Regular guys got you running your ass off? 
  It was a fire alarm, okay? 
  They were coming at me. 
  Sorry, which one got you scared? 
  The guys in the hoodies or the alarm? 
  Look, that place, okay, is freaky. 
  And that thing with the plane it's not natural. 
  Look, I didn't do anything to any church. 
  Did you No, I don't think we said anything about a church. 
  So, let's start over. 
  From the beginning. 
  That guy just got an upgrade from witness to suspect. 
  Based on what? 
  Another one of your hunches? 
  He's lying through his teeth. 
  We didn't even suggest he was involved, and he started denying it. 
  You pull a random guy into the box in the middle of the day, of course he's on edge. 
  He's involved. 
  I know it. 
  Then prove it, or thank him for his help and offer him a ride home. 
  Thanks for meeting me. 
  You pop up out of nowhere after falling off the face of the Earth for a year? 
  Of course I'm gonna be curious. 
  I didn't mean to disappear. 
  It just sort of happened. 
  It felt pretty intentional to me. 
  I never meant to hurt you. 
  I know you were never big on goodbyes, but after what we went through, I think I deserved better. 
  That's actually why I'm here. 
  I'm going through the program. 
  Mommy put you in rehab again? 
  No, this time it was me. 
  So, what do you want from me? 
  A gold star? 
  I need to make amends. 
  Courtney, I'm sorry for all the ways I hurt you. 
  I wish I could take it all back. 
  You make it sound like it was the worst time of our lives. 
  But we had fun. 
  The only thing I remember was us always chasing the next high. 
  If that's what you need to tell yourself No, that that came off wrong. 
  I don't mean No, it's it's nice to know I made such an impact. 
  Consider your amends made. 
  I want to help you. 
  Please. 
  If there's anything I can do, would you please I can take care of myself, thanks. 
  I had no other choice when you vanished into thin air, did I? 
  Good luck sticking with the program this time. 
  That is either the longest page in history, or you are somewhere else. 
  I know what it is to lose a child. 
  I don't think I can go through it again. 
  You have to have faith. 
  You have to look at the future with the possibility That everything will turn out well. 
  Stay strong, little girl. 
  You have the best mom in the whole world. 
  But don't tell her I told you so. 
  Grace. 
  They're not random. 
  What are you talking about? 
  What happened to you. 
  This recent wave of violence. 
  The Xers are systematically attacking the passengers. 
  We ran the data. 
  They're coordinating their attacks to overwhelm the police and minimize the chance they'll get caught. 
  The Xers are organized? 
  The timing and distribution of the attacks is too precise to be a coincidence. 
  So, Mom's accident and everything that happened at the church, it's connected? 
  Everything is connected. 
  It's just gonna get worse. 
  I don't see how this ever ends. 
  We'll have to go investigate. 
  Okay. 
  Olive, what are you doing here? 
  Everything okay? 
  Okay, I have I have something to tell you, but you can't tell Mom and Dad. 
  I know what happened at the Church of the Believers. 
  How? 
  I was there. 
  I'm one of them. 
 
 
 
  Good news. 
  We found no sign of placental abruption or trauma to the fetus. 
  So, the baby's okay? 
  - Yes. 
  - Thank God. 
  But this was no minor accident. 
  You need to take it very easy. 
  We don't want any further complications. 
  Understood. 
  - Thank you, doctor. 
  - You're so welcome. 
  Well, that's it. 
  I'm wrapping you and our baby girl in bubble wrap. 
  Well, I'm not sure how I feel about that. 
  We can talk about it at home. 
  I'm proud of you. 
  Coming forward isn't easy. 
  Well, when Dad said this had to do with Mom and Cal's accident You're gonna have to tell your parents. 
  No. 
  I can't. 
  Please don't make me. 
  Olive, you're a minor about to identify a suspect in a crime. 
  They're gonna find out. 
  It's better if it comes from you. 
  No, there there has to be some other way. 
  Look, the number of times I've done something that I wish nobody would find out about You can't run away from your problems, though. 
  It never works. 
  Eventually, it catches up. 
  Take your time, okay? 
  Just remember, they can't see you. 
  Number two. 
  That's him. 
  There were three more guys, but I don't I don't see them here. 
  You're under arrest for aggravated assault and conspiracy to commit violence. 
  You have the right to remain silent and to legal counsel. 
  Look, I didn't do anything! 
  We have a witness who says otherwise. 
  And we've linked the attack to other incidents of violence against passengers of Flight 828. 
  DA actually wants to tack on conspiracy. 
  Look, I want a lawyer. 
  You're looking at quite some time. 
  Unless, of course, you know, you've got something to offer us. 
  No? 
  Okay. 
  But if we get your buddies first, then the deal's off. 
  Okay, okay, alright. 
  Look. 
  I don't know their last names, alright? 
  They're just some guys from the club. 
  What club? 
  Where is it? 
  We believe this is the headquarters of a violent group responsible for systematic and coordinated attacks against the passengers of Flight 828. 
  Last-minute assist by her niece seems a bit suspicious. 
  What are the chances Stone's right about this? 
  You known her to be wrong yet? 
  And the DA bought into her theory about the attacks being connected. 
  Doesn't mean she's not leading the entire squad into a situation she can't control. 
  Well, we can't call it off now, or it'll look like whistleblower retribution for her turning against you. 
  nightmare full of blind spots and dead ends, and it's their home turf, so surprise is gonna be key to our success. 
  Everyone on site is considered armed and suspect. 
  I just realized I've been so focused on the Major and the Death Date, I I didn't see the Xers coming. 
  It's over now, Ben. 
  It's not. 
  The Calling said, "Save her". 
  I didn't save anyone. 
  We just got incredibly lucky, Grace. 
  No, there's something we're missing. 
  The Xers are still out there. 
  Adrian is making things worse. 
  I-I don't know how Mick convinced a Believer to help. 
  It was me. 
  I was at the church this morning. 
  I saw everything. 
  What were you doing at the church? 
  It was my turn to prep the service. 
  You're one of them? 
  You make it sound like I'm an alien. 
  Olive, the Believers are a cult. 
  Why? 
  Because they think that a plane that came back 5 and a half years later is a miracle? 
  Millions of people believe stuff that they have never seen, but we all saw 828, and it was a miracle. 
  Yeah, maybe it was. 
  Or maybe it was an extraterrestrial encounter. 
  Or maybe we got stuck in a time loop that stopped the aging process and expanded our brain capacity so we could predict the future. 
  We have no idea, Olive. 
  And Adrian Adrian doesn't, either. 
  That doesn't invalidate his teachings. 
  No, no, no. 
  He's entitled to his opinions. 
  What he's not entitled to is taking advantage of us. 
  He's using 828 to put money in his pocket, and in the process, making the rest of the world scared to death of us. 
  The rest of the world needs to open their eyes! 
  And what church doesn't raise money? 
  No, no, this is different. 
  Olive, sometimes people exploit a difficult situation. 
  No, sometimes people are way too narrow-minded to see what is right in front of them. 
  - That is not fair. 
  - Is it fair to just tell me to accept the Death Date and give up?! 
  I didn't give up when people thought you and Cal were dead, and here you are! 
  Same with Mom and the baby. 
  Do Don't you see? 
  No. 
  I do. 
  And I love that you're looking for answers. 
  I do. 
  So am I. 
  And I'm not gonna stop. 
  No one is giving up. 
  But your mother and Cal were targeted. 
  Olive, they could have died. 
  And that's Adrian's fault? 
  It is! 
  Look, it might be the Xers who are physically attacking us, but it's the Believers who are creating this hatred and fear by insisting passengers are different from regular human beings! 
  You are different! 
  Olive. 
  We are just trying to protect you. 
  I'm sick of being protected! 
  And I'm sick of being afraid! 
  And you may not like it, but while you were gone, I grew up! 
  We sure this is a good idea? 
  A lot of these guys aren't exactly "Team Michaela". 
  There's a big difference between dirty looks and friendly fire. 
  All it takes is one guy not having your back. 
  - Do you have my back? 
  - Of course I do. 
  That's all I need. 
  - Back entrance set. 
  - Proceed with caution. 
  - Let's do it. 
  - Let's get some bad guys. 
  NYPD! 
  Hands where we can see them! 
  All clear. 
  Back room clear. 
  Clear. 
  Clear. 
  We have them all clear. 
  I got nothing. 
  Seems like we just missed them. 
  We'll get them next time. 
  We'll get somebody this time. 
  10 bucks says that's the truck that hit my sister-in-law. 
  Take some paint. 
  Bring it to the lab. 
  When it matches, bring the owner in. 
  Looks like Walter sold you a bill of goods. 
  No, ma'am. 
  This is the right place. 
  That truck was involved in a hit-and-run with another passenger. 
  - And you know this how? 
  - Because it was my sister-in-law. 
  More family members. 
  God, I knew I shouldn't have given you this case. 
  They were here. 
  Okay, somebody tipped them off, and whoever it was, was at the precinct 'cause they were the only ones who Okay, Stone, you are woefully short on friends as it is, and accusations like that, without any proof, aren't gonna do you any good. 
  Captain. 
  We have a leak! 
  No refunds for warm beer. 
  It was cold when I served it. 
  Proper drink for my friend. 
  That, uh, single malt that you hide behind the counter. 
  Are we celebrating? 
  I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong. 
  You did us a solid today. 
  I didn't do that for you. 
  I did it for her. 
  The trek to Rikers from here sucks. 
  Hey, what do you say we go out tonight? 
  'Cause a friend of mine wants to show you his appreciation. 
  Why not? 
  A friend of yours is a friend of mine. 
  Salud. 
  I thought eventually, people would realize we were normal, and the hate would disappear, but it seems to be the opposite. 
  You just gotta keep doing what you're doing. 
  The bigots will give in before you do. 
  Are you, uh, calling me stubborn? 
  Determined, maybe. 
  It's good, though. 
  Got me out of jail. 
  Best decision I ever made. 
  You sure what happened today didn't have anything to do with you burning down the precinct to set me free? 
  I don't care. 
  It was worth it. 
  Enough about me, though. 
  How was your meeting? 
  Good. 
  Making progress. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I don't mean to bother you. 
  But is Zeke here? 
  Court. 
  How did you ? 
  Your mom told me where to find you. 
  I don't have anywhere else to go. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Michaela. 
  Michaela, this is Courtney. 
  His wife. 
  You gonna come up soon? 
  Grace. 
  You should be in bed. 
  Doctor's orders. 
  You don't get to have a monopoly on parental concern. 
  How did we not know? 
  I don't know. 
  Teenagers have secrets. 
  Well, she's not wrong about me. 
  Why are you putting this on yourself? 
  No, I've been scaring all of us. 
  I've been so focused on the Death Date and the passengers, I I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 
  What's this? 
  It's the compass Michaela got from the bank last week. 
  This engraving? 
  Yeah, we've been trying to figure out what it means. 
  I've seen this before. 
  Well, you've seen the peacock. 
  Not just the peacock. 
  This exact image. 
  On one of the boards? 
  No. 
  This was before. 
  When you and Cal were gone, Olive was always insisting that you were out there somewhere. 
  This one day, we were walking past this tarot reader, and Olive was so desperate and my grief was so overwhelming I couldn't say no. 
  This card. 
  The star represents hope. 
  The woman said it was what her future held. 
  She gave it to Olive. 
  How is this possible? 
  There's more. 
  The reader said that we should look to the future with the possibility that everything will turn out well. 
  It became like a mantra for Olive. 
  She clung to it. 
  And then today, when she came to the hospital, she said those exact words to me. 
  Maybe a miracle did save the baby. 
  Maybe this is all a miracle. 
  Ben, this is a sign. 
  What if the Callings are trying to tell us that there's a way out of this, a way out of the Death Date, a way out of all of it? 
  Yeah, maybe they are. 
  But if Adrian and the Believers keep turning the world against us and get us all killed first what does any of it matter? 
  I'm not going to tell you there isn't hatred in our world. 
  Or deny the uncomfortable truth that there are people who wish us harm. 
  But I will ask that you trust that better days lie ahead. 
  Save her. 
  Each and every one of you has embraced things we cannot explain. 
  And by opening our hearts, we'll show others the way, until even those who hate will have their eyes opened to the miracle. 
  But I'm not afraid. 
  I believe in miracles. 
  I am a miracle. 
  And I'm here to tell you that we were wrong about death. 
  It is not final. 
  Not the end of a journey. 
  Follow me, and I will show you. 
  Blessed are the believers. 
  Blessed are the believers. 
  Ohh! 
  Stay away from my daughter.
