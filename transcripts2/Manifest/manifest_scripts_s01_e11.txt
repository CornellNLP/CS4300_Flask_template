 Previously on "Manifest" Lourdes is on her way. I'll go I'll go get her. No. No, no, please. Stay with me. As you know, I study shared consciousness, like the callings you've all experienced. She studies "shared consciousness" and just happens to be on the plane? 
  Coincidences happen. So do conspiracies. MAN: I think perhaps you lost your phone? 
  No, that's not - mine. - It is now. Why does he get to be in my house with my children? 
  You are the whole reason this family is messed up. I love you. It's always been you. No matter what I do, I'm the bad guy, and I'm tired of it. I understand. I-I'll leave. No, no, no. I'll [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  SAANVI: I think I found the Major's Holy Grail. They found that some of the passengers are more sensitive to the callings. Cal. [WIND WHISTLING] 
  No one's blaming you for what happened to MA 828. You can't help me. [DOOR OPENS] 
  Miss anything? 
  Oh, about 300 miles of glassy ocean. How's the cargo? 
  Lady in 5-D wants a hypoallergenic blanket. Uh, did anybody point out that she's breathing recycled air full of skin cells and flatulence? 
  You would make a horrible flight attendant. I'm a cowboy, Amuta. Plane's my horse, and the sky an open desert. [CHUCKLES] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [THUNDER BOOMING] 
  [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] 
  [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  What the Center, this is MA 828. We got a bit of unplanned turbulence up here. Where the hell did that come from? 
  It wasn't on any of the charts. It's okay. Every [PASSENGERS SHOUTING] 
  Please. [SCREAMING CONTINUES] 
  [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
  I've never seen anything like this. - You? 
  - Never. [ALARM BEEPS] 
  [ENGINES ROARING] 
  Get over it. Up! 
  Up! 
  [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  No time. I'm going through it. You're what? 
  [ENGINES ROAR] 
  Accelerating airspeed to 300 knots. Are you sure about this? 
  Maintaining a level altitude. [ALL CLAMORING] 
  [METALLIC GROANING] 
  Here we go. I didn't have a choice. The NTSB report tells another story. According to the ground telemetry, you made a series of unconventional maneuvers. You don't understand. There is no "conventional maneuver" when a storm appears right on top of you. And this storm was like nothing I've ever seen. Daly, people have been going over every aspect of this flight with a microscope for 5 1/2 years, looking into everything from the plane's maintenance reports to the last place each of the passengers had dinner. And the only thing anyone can find that's out of the ordinary is the abrupt moves you made right before you flew into that storm and your plane disappeared. I'm the captain. Those people put their lives in my hands. I take that seriously. I did what I had to do. [ENGINES ROARING] 
  [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] 
  [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
  CAL: Um, excuse me, mister? 
  You're the pilot, right? 
  I sure am. My dad said sometimes pilots give kids wings. You have any wings I could have? 
  Sorry, kiddo. Uh, they just got clipped. [CHUCKLES] 
  It's okay. Thanks for bringing us home. [SIGHS] 
  [ENGINES ROARING] 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - Best day ever, dad. - For me, too. But next time, can we go out to watch a movie? 
  The screen at your place is a little small. Look, buddy, right now, we kinda need to keep a low profile because some people are interested in us because we were on 828, and they may not be very nice. You mean the Major. How did you know about that? 
  I heard you and Auntie Mick talking about her. It's fine, Dad. I know I'm supposed to stay safe. There's my Calamander. I missed you. Sorry I came in the house. I wanted to make sure Ben, it's it's fine. It's your house, too. You can come inside. Mom, Dad got us TV dinners. It was awesome. Was it, now? 
  Salisbury steak always a favorite. I bet. Do you think you can do it again tomorrow? 
  I've got this thing that's come up at work. Yeah, sure. Maybe we could try the turkey dinner. But Dad can't tomorrow. He's gonna be busy. I am? 
  The man from the plane? 
  He needs your help. Man from the plane? 
  Look, I'm sure we can work something out. Worst case scenario, it's Michaela's day off. Awesome. Auntie Mick. There we go. [CHUCKLES] 
  - Love you, kiddo. - Olive! 
  Guess what. I got to have Hungry Man. [SIGHS] 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [SIREN CHIRPS, WAILS] 
  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Find her. Find her. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  Riojas tells me you traded shifts. Yeah, I did. Mick, why are you avoiding me? 
  Come on. Mick. This is a good thing. You know we're meant to be together. Jared, last night was a mistake. It was cheating. This is our chance to make it right. All right, look. Tell me what I'm supposed to do here. I don't know. I-I'm I can't do this. I can't be the other woman. - You want me to tell Lourdes? 
  - No, no. Mick, I want to be with you. Look, I know it's messy, okay, but we'll get through it together. - Lourdes, she's - She's your wife and my best friend. Don't you love her? 
  Of course I do. So do I. I'm not doing this to her. It doesn't matter what happened to us five years ago. It matters what we do now. [SIGHS] 
  I'm sorry. [SIGHS] 
  [ISRAEL NASH'S "SPIRITFALLS" PLAYS] 
  - I keep seeing these reflections - [SIGHS] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Really? 
  Again? 
  You can't just take one night off? 
  What, now that we think Cal's the Major's Holy Grail? 
  No, I can't. - Plus, he gave me homework. - Cal? 
  He told Grace I couldn't watch him tomorrow because I was gonna be too busy helping a man from the plane. I'm trying to figure out what that means. So you may be hanging with Cal tomorrow, if that's cool. Yeah, sounds fun. Plus, it'll keep me out of trouble. Why? 
  What's going on? 
  Just trying to dig myself out of a gigantic hole filled with quicksand. Colorful. - Jared? 
  - Mm. [CHUCKLES] 
  - Want to talk about it? 
  - No, not really. Think I just need to take a break from it. So, uh, how are you planning on figuring out what man from the plane you're supposed to help? 
  No idea. We just have to trust that any calling Cal has is pointing me to things I should know - need to know. - To what end, Ben? 
  I mean, you really think this is gonna help us figure out 828, why we're back? 
  Right now, this is about keeping Cal safe, day by day. - You're doing that. - Am I? 
  Cal's biggest threat is the Major, and I have zero clue who she is. Don't do that. Don't start spiraling. You are doing the best anyone could be expected to do. My best might not be enough. [CELLPHONE RINGING] 
  Captain Daly. Talk about a man from the plane. [SCOFFS] 
  - Hey. - Ben, can we meet? 
  Sure, what's up? 
  [SIGHS] 
  It It wasn't my fault. Everybody blames me for 828, but it wasn't me, and I think I can prove it, but I need your help. I'll come and get you tomorrow. Sure. And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing You know the worst thing about being the captain of a plane that disappears for 5 1/2 years is? 
  I would say the lost time, like the rest of us. No. It's that everyone blames you for what happened. How can they? 
  No one even knows what went on that night. Oh, it doesn't matter. The people that think we flew to an island and were cryogenically frozen, they think I'm the one who flew us there. Bill, you can't take that stuff seriously. I mean, hell, even the people who all think it's just an alien invasion think I'm the alien. Look, this has been hell for all of us my wife, my kids so I can only imagine how difficult it's been for you, being the focus of everything. I have a son, electrical engineer, and I had a wife. They didn't talk to me much before we went away. I was no saint. But now they don't even want to see me. And I don't blame 'em after what the news media did to me. For 5 1/2 years, I was the guy who took a plane full of people and killed them. And now I'm the guy who made them all disappear. No, I'm not gonna let them catch me, no Not gonna let them catch [ENGINES ROARING] 
  [LAUGHING] 
  Hey! 
  Captain Future. You gonna fly through the Bermuda Triangle again? 
  Gonna try. Be careful in there. Don't go getting disappeared on us. What's this? 
  Every official document for Flight 828 on record. Everything from NTSB, Transportation and Safety Reports, to White House briefings. This is amazing. No, it's all a lie. Same as always. Thanks, Raf. [BEEPS] 
  Okay, Raf. Load 'er up. [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Look familiar? 
  Depends. What am I looking at? 
  Well, according to the NTSB, the exact flight conditions from the night we disappeared. Hmm. There's only one problem. [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
  That storm? 
  Storm? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  No, Ben. I fly through stuff like this all the time. This barely qualifies as weather. So it's not how you remember it? 
  Ben, you were on that flight. You know what kind of turbulence we hit. And I've been flying simulations on this data every day since we came back, and I can't find anything like the storm we flew into on 828. It certainly felt big. It was enormous. And it came out of nowhere. - [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  - [THUNDER CRASHES] 
  This is not that storm. This is a government cover-up. Bill, I don't understand. Why would the government cover up a storm? 
  'Cause we came back? 
  No, no, you're missing the point. Hit that thing. Check the date on that report. No, the simulator data it's from 2013. The government didn't start hiding things on the day we came back. It started on the day we disappeared. Yeah, I know. Okay. Thanks, Amuta. Yep. Co-pilot completely backs Daly's story. Where is the co-pilot in all this? 
  - Back in Jamaica. - No, thank you. He says Daly's the only reason any of us survived that flight. I don't know, Ben. How sure are we this isn't just two men trying to clear their name? 
  Of course Daly's trying to clear his name. He's the face of what happened to us, and he'll never be able to escape it. Mick, Cal's the one who told me I was supposed to help him. Daly was flying the plane. If anyone knows what the weather was like that night, it's him. But why would they publish an inaccurate weather report? 
  How do we know Daly isn't exaggerating or misremembering? 
  I don't know. But I remember what I felt up there, and I know you do, too. Mostly I can't get past this. You read all of this, didn't you? 
  It's the minutes from the Congressional investigation. On January 4, 2014, a meteorologist was scheduled to testify to the panel about the plane's disappearance. He never showed and then abruptly retired to Massapequa. - That's interesting. - It's more than interesting. This guy was studying coastal erosion in the exact area the plane disappeared. Whatever happened that night, he was in perfect position to see it. He's still there in Massapequa? 
  Yeah. Daly's coming to pick me up now. BEN: Roger Mencin? 
  No Bibles, no votes, don't rent out the dock. You can move on. No, we're not here about any of that. We have a few questions about 828. You're the captain. William Daly. Dr. Mencin, we're trying to figure out what happened to that plane. We believe you can help. What makes you think I know anything about that flight? 
  Because there was a storm that night, and you had the most sophisticated instrumentation in the area. You know the truth. Did the NTSB get it wrong? 
  What were you gonna tell Congress? 
  Please. We flew through something giant. - It was different. - I can't talk about this. They made me swear under oath. Who is "they"? 
  Please. He's just trying to clear his name. The whole world thinks he's responsible for what happened. You know he's not. Okay. We're gonna do some homework like your mom said, and then we can get back to some more awesomeness. Did you like doing homework when you were in school, Auntie Mick? 
  No, of course not. There's only one Stone sibling that was a big enough nerd to like homework. Can I play some Xbox first to warm up my brain? 
  Does that normally work on your dad? 
  - No. - Gimme some credit, buddy. [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  Sorry. I-I know it's weird to just show up like this. I need your help. What's up, Autumn? 
  It's kind of hard to explain. Can we go for coffee or something? 
  Um, I can't leave the little guy, but I can put a pot on in here. Hey, Cal, you're good if my friend Autumn comes and hangs with us for a little bit? 
  - You play video games? 
  - No. After your homework. Oh, my goodness. Listen to me. Come on in. You ever hear of dark lightning? 
  It's a high-energy atmospheric discharge, and it releases lots of ionizing radiation. For years, no one even knew it existed because you have to be very close to detect it. But you saw it? 
  I discovered it on my instruments. But the DOD, they don't like what they don't understand, and the idea of some magic lightning taking down an airplane, well Then when they found out that I was gonna testify, they suggested that I take early retirement. Suggested or threatened? 
  I figured everyone on the plane was dead. My testifying wasn't gonna bring them back. But we are back. And we need your help. Look, there's nothing I can do. They made me, you know, destroy every copy, delete every file. But you didn't, did you? 
  No, you find information that ends your career, you hold on to it. Roger, lives were changed forever because of that flight, and we had no say in the matter. We deserve to know what really happened. They've taken my reputation, my career, and my family. All I want is the truth. [SIGHS] 
  You know, when that plane came back, I knew it was just a matter of time before someone came looking. Guess I should have moved. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] 
  AUTUMN: I know how it sounds. And I also know criminals always say they're innocent, but I promise. I went legit. That's why I was in Jamaica to get away. Yeah, that's why I went, too. But when the plane disappeared, my "friends" did to me the things that we'd done to other people. Stole my identity, pinned years of theft and fraud on me, but I didn't do any of it. By the time I came back I just want to be free to embrace this new chance I have. I'm not sure what I can do to help. I can't just make a warrant disappear. I don't need you to. I just need your help to find the person who did this. Her name is Clarissa Ford. If I can find her, I can prove I'm innocent. Okay. Okay, I'll see what I can do. CAPTAIN DALY: Okay, Raf. One more time. RAF: Okay, new data entered. You are good to go. CAPTAIN DALY: With the actual data not the lies that the government published I'll finally be able to prove it wasn't my fault. Please let this be it. [THUNDER CRASHING] 
  [THUNDER CRASHES] 
  Finally. Hello, mama. BEN: My God. That came out of nowhere. What do you think I've been saying? 
  I've been over it 100 times. I made the airspeed 300 knots. [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  Maintaining a level altitude. You flew threw it? 
  You're damn right I did. [THUNDER CRASHING] 
  [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  Here comes the turbulence. [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
  We flew into the storm. And then we Pull up. Pull up. Pull up. System shutdown. Damn it! 
  Hit the reset, Raf. We're going again. Six times! 
  How the hell? 
  We made it through that storm. Yeah, but to five years in the future. We're missing something. Bill, the simulator isn't gonna transport us through time. I mean, how could it re-create what we went through? 
  But at least this proves you weren't at fault. No, the only thing this proves is that we're on the right track. And that dark lightning may be the source of what happened to us. This is huge. Ben, I lost everything because of 828. Until I can prove this was the cause, this means nothing. And this storm didn't just throw us through time. It also triggered whatever mind-meld thing Fiona Clarke's been going on about. And how is that possible? 
  She studies mind-melds, and all our minds get melded. - She's the missing link. - Bill, she's one of us. - She seems to be as in the dark - No. - as we are. - I refuse to believe that. Someone powerful's behind this cover-up. The T-The plane, the voices, all of it. It makes perfect sense that they'd keep a passenger who's an expert in this stuff involved from the start. I tell you what. You stay here. Keep trying. I'll go talk to Fiona. Maybe we should go together. Look, she may be more open with me alone, seeing as how I haven't been calling her a government plant to her face for the last week. [CELLPHONE RINGING] 
  Hey, how's Massapequa? 
  Yeah, no, he's fine. Uh, Grace is gonna come get him in an hour. Mick, Daly was right. One sec. Um, hey, buddy, why don't you teach Autumn how to play this game? 
  I'm in. He was right about what? 
  Everything. Grab that blue binder. I need you to look something up. Yeah, hold on. So, who do you want to be? 
  Uh, why don't you choose for me? 
  Okay. I got it. What do you need? 
  [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  - Hey. - Hey, he is all in one piece. - I promise. - [LAUGHS] 
  I wasn't worried. Hey! 
  Mom, watch this. Whoa! 
  Awesome! 
  A lot of blood. Yeah, you should see him and Ben get into it. - I can't tell who the kid is. - [LAUGHS] 
  I let Dad win sometimes. Oh, that's my boy. Thank you so much for watching him. He loves spending time with you. Not at all. Ditto. How you holding up? 
  Uh you know. It's not exactly what I had pictured for myself at this point in my life. Yeah. You and me both. I take it things with Jared haven't gotten any less complicated. No. You'll get through it. You're amazing, Mick. You two will find your way. So will you. Look, I know Ben is my family, but you are the best thing that has ever happened to him. I'm serious. I am rooting for you guys for both of you. Thank you. Rooting for us, too. He loves you. I know. And I love him. I just hope it'll be enough. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  We shouldn't have to track you down. I just turned the phone off for a bit. It's never to be turned off. We're overdue for a chat. Dark lightning? 
  Daly and I tracked down a meteorologist who thinks we may have flown through some, that it could have affected our plane. I don't know. I'll admit, it's not impossible, but [SIGHS] 
  whatever happened to us up there, it doesn't feel accidental. Frankly, I believe we took a step in our evolution. Daly's convinced himself otherwise, and frankly, he makes a strong case. Well, I understand Daly wanting to prove he's not responsible. I thought it was my fault when you told me the government was experimenting on people using my research. The truth is, Daly's no more to blame for what happened on that flight than I am. I don't think that's gonna bring him much comfort, seeing as how he thinks you're behind this whole thing. Captain Daly is so convinced of things, he's grasping at any straw to try and make his case. He's lost sight of the horizon. Don't you do the same. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  JARED: Hey. What are you working on? 
  I'm just helping out a friend. Need help? 
  No, I'm okay. Thanks. Are you sure? 
  No lines you need crossed, favors that might bite me in the ass later on? 
  Think I gotta do it all on my own now. Mick, I'm here for you if you ever need me. No matter what. Jared, we can't [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
 
 
 
  - What is it? 
  - I gotta make a call. [CELLPHONE RINGS] 
  Hey, what's up? 
  Your meteorologist, Roger Mencin he's dead. What? 
  How? 
  Boating accident. Just came across our system. Ben, somebody knows that you're looking into this. We gotta warn Daly. Okay. I'll meet you there. Yo, Captain, you in there? 
  [KEYS JINGLE] 
  What'd he do, talk someone to death? 
  We're worried Captain Daly might be in some danger. What, from those religious freaks that have been following him around? 
  Whole thing's a complete cluster. Oh. Thank you. We've got it from here. Thanks. Daly, you in here? 
  Wow. I didn't know it was this bad. MICHAELA: No sign of him. Hey, earth to Ben. Is this what Grace sees when she looks at me? 
  Ben, you're just thorough. You're trying to protect your family. You're trying to protect all of us. - Daly, this is - Desperate. [SIGHS] 
  He's going looking for dark lightning, for real, no simulator. - What do you mean? 
  - Look at this. Today's weather report, navigational charts. There's a storm off the coast. He's so desperate to prove 828 wasn't his fault, he's gonna fly right into it. - Can he actually do that? 
  - I doubt it, but it could definitely get him killed. [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  Captain. I'm glad you came. I just put the kettle on. We need to set some things straight. I was thinking the same thing. [GRUNTING] 
  Hey, kiddo. How was your day with Auntie Mick? 
  Fun. Yeah? 
  She say anything about how your dad's doing? 
  Eating a lot of TV dinners? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Dad's okay. He's out helping people. Yeah, that's your dad. I want to be like him. I want to help people, too. BEN: Please, this is urgent. I was just here with Captain Daly. Remember Bermuda Triangle, the whole thing? 
  - You were here. - Sorry. You need new authorization for each visit. NYPD. A little out of your jurisdiction, aren't you? 
  Harris, is it? 
  We have reason to believe William Daly's about to steal an airplane. [LAUGHS] 
  What, the cargo loaders - put you up to this? 
  - We're dead serious. Come on! 
  He's in the simulator, like he's been every day for the past three weeks. It's a little sad, if you ask me. Aren't the simulators over there? 
  Then what's he doing over there? 
  Joe. It's Harris. We got a problem. [DOOR OPENING] 
  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] 
  MAN: All aircraft, this is ground control. We have a runaway incursion. Ordering a full ground stop. Hey, why are you stopping? 
  We need to get him! 
  I need to explain to you what a full ground stop means? 
  Can I talk to him on that? 
  The emergency frequency should get you through to the cockpit radio. Daly, it's Ben. Please don't do this. Sorry, Ben. I have no choice. MAN: Unidentified aircraft, please identify yourself. This is Captain William Daly requesting takeoff clearance on runway two-niner left. That request is denied. Power down your engines immediately. Bill, I know it's not your fault. I can help you prove it. But if you steal that plane, none of this is gonna matter. You don't get it, Ben. I need to see this all the way through. You can't help me anymore. But she can. She's my missing link. [FIONA COUGHS] 
  My God. What have you done? 
  Help! 
  He's got Fiona. I'll call it in. This is madness. I had nothing to do with 828. We weren't brought back to be turning on each other. Let me go! 
  Unauthorized aircraft, this is your last warning. Power down your engines, or we will notify the Air National Guard. Bill, stop! 
  Please, stop! 
  I'm sorry. This is the only way to prove I did nothing wrong. No. Let me out! 
  No, no, no, no, no! 
  MICHAELA: No! 
  No! 
  No! 
  Daly, don't do this! 
  [ENGINES ROARING] 
  What are you doing? 
  Where are you taking me? 
  I know the truth. I can help you prove it, but not if you do this. If you keep going, the whole world is gonna think you were behind Flight 828. No. This will make me a hero. The guy who uncovered what really happened. Damn it! 
  What does he think he's gonna do? 
  He thinks he can fly through time. Wait. Can he? 
  CAPTAIN DALY: This is the only way, Ben. It's the only way to give my life some meaning. Proving this is all I have left. I can do it again. Fiona can show me how. Captain, I don't know what happened on that plane any more than you do. Bill, Fiona can't help you. She's innocent in all this. Of course she's part of it. Who do you think told the Major about the meteorologist? 
  What? 
  I did no such thing. Did you tell her? 
  [ENGINES ROARING] 
  Daly, if you don't turn around, those planes will shoot you down. Not if I'm in the future. MAN: Captain Daly, this is the Air National Guard. Your flight plan is unauthorized. What say we turn that bird around and get your feet on the ground? 
  Negative. A. N. G. , be advised. I am not a threat. I have no intention of harm. BEN: Bill, please. If you turn that plane toward the city, it's over. [THUNDER CRASHES] 
  [ALARMS BEEPING] 
  Bill, you're more than a pilot. You're a father. You have a family. They don't need me. No, I need you! 
  You're the only one that can help me figure this out. You're the captain. No. You're the captain now. The passengers are your responsibility. You're their leader. [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
  [THUNDER CRASHES] 
  Per protocol, climbing to penetration altitude. Captain, you think you were the only one who suffered because of Flight 828? 
  My entire life's work was proven true, and yet I was kept out of the loop. Making airspeed 300 knots. If I were really behind all this, why would I not have included myself? 
  I've heard no voices, experienced no collective consciousness. Last chance, Doctor. Tell me what I gotta do to make the dark lightning happen? 
  Daly, damn it! 
  I already told you. I don't know! 
  [THUNDER CRASHING] 
  Then I'll do the same as before. Let's see if lightning strikes twice. Come on. Get there. F-16 PILOT: Command, this is Viper One-One. Target is unresponsive. Heading toward land. COMMANDER: Viper One-One. You are cleared to engage. Bill! 
  Per protocol, adjusting flight path to storm center. [THUNDER ROARS] 
  I'm not ready to die, Bill. Please. Who said anything about dying? 
  I'll see you in 2024. [ENGINES ROARING] 
  [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
  No. No. F-16 PILOT: Command, this is Viper One-One. Threat has been neutralized. [CHUCKLES] 
  REPORTER: The search continues for Captain William Daly and Professor Fiona Clarke. Hours after their plane was reportedly shot from the sky, the plane's remains as well as Hey, it's me. I have some stuff I need to drop off for Cal. I was hoping I could come by and say good night. large numbers, electric with the hope that yet another miracle may have saved the 828 returnees. One person I spoke with was adamant that Daly was able to transport into time, just like he did with Flight 828. Another felt the disappearance was a part of a conspiracy against the passengers. Overall, the theories are as numerous as the mourners, but there is one truth that seems to be making itself clear the 828 passengers have a growing fan base [SCOFFS] 
  20 feet. Daly was sitting just 20 feet from us, and the whole world blamed him for what happened. Lost his family, his son, - [TV CLICKS OFF]
