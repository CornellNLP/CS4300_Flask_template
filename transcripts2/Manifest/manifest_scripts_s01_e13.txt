 SAANVI: Listen, I discovered something in Cal's blood.   
 It's a marker, and it wasn't there before the plane,   
 and it turns out that I have it, too.   
 Did you get a calling, buddy, that told you to come here?   
 - He's coming. 
- Cal.    
 He's almost here.    
 I was hiking. There was a blizzard.    
 I had a vision of you.    
 I heard you. I-I saw you.    
 I fell in some sort of cave.    
 I was burning literally everything I had trying to stay warm.    
 It was like you were giving me your strength,    
 willing me to live.    
 How is it possible you're here?    
 What year did you leave?
