 Maybe you're supposed to come back with me.

- Back into the world?   
 I'm not sure the world wants me back.

Or at least I imagined one.    
 You, too?

 I need one of you down on the waterfront.    
 Recovery of the getaway vehicle from that armored-car heist that went into the East River.

 We got a uni riding with him already.

 Nah. Mercy's closer. No, no, trust me.
