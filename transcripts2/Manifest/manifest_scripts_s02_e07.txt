 Previously on "Manifest" Stay away from my daughter. 
  - You have to go. 
  - What? 
  Your dad was very clear. 
  We're turning away the very people who experienced the miracle firsthand. 
  How are we going to get the rest of the world to believe? 
  There'll be another miracle, Isaiah an even bigger one. 
  Come on, baby. 
  - Come on, come on. 
  - Something in me died that day, and it still hurts. 
  It's the Al-Zuras Deck, created by Yusuv Al-Zuras. 
  According to legend, he was lost at sea for 10 years. 
  Upon returning, he claimed he could hear the voice of God in his head. 
  COURTNEY: I've seen Zeke try to get clean, but he always had a backup plan. 
  He'd stash a couple pills in the barrel of his razor. 
  - Get a doctor right now. 
  - Right away. 
  MICHAELA: She was experimenting on herself? 
  She blames herself for the Major getting her research, and now she feels she has to catch up. 
  [WIND WHISTLES] 
  What the hell is happening? 
  You'll need these. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Really? 
  And bug spray. 
  I hear they have mosquitos the size of small cats in Jamaica. 
  Seriously? 
  Mom, it's a carry-on I'm gonna be gone for a week. 
  I know, but you can't afford to eat out as much as the other kids. 
  - I worry. 
  - Fine. 
  I'll take the bars. 
  Do you know how proud I am of you? 
  - [LAUGHING] 
  Mom, stop. 
  - No, no, I want to say this. 
  I don't know what I did to deserve such a smart, kind boy. 
  You sure you're gonna be okay? 
  Like you said, it's only a week. 
  [SIGHS] 
  OLIVE: Okay, so, I can't tell. 
  Do you want to go tomorrow night, or ? 
  Yeah, sorry. 
  What's the deal? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  To the club. 
  Maxine's going. 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - And I can't really deal with my parents right now. 
  They are all, like, gloomy Chicken Littles. 
  'Cause of that freaky Calling. 
  There's a lot to be afraid of right now. 
  There's also a lot to appreciate. 
  Like that I got to meet you? 
  Exactly. 
  Coming back was a gift, and it's wrong not to acknowledge it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You sound like Adrian, Church Lady. 
  Well, he's kind of the only person that makes sense to me right now. 
  What about me? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Yeah. 
  You make a little sense, too. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  - - I'm stumped. 
  Champagne glasses, burnt-out plane cabin, melting walls. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You will figure it out. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Will I? 
  Seems to me, I figure out one Calling only to get another one even more terrifying. 
  Grace, I felt a hopelessness, like whatever we're meant to save the passengers from, it's coming and it's violent. 
  - Hey, let's have a real Saturday. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Want to go to the Whitney, maybe walk the High Line? 
  I can't. 
  I got to go to work. 
  Hey, I can't find my razor. 
  Can I borrow yours? 
  Knock yourself out. 
  Hmm. 
  - [CABINET DOOR CLOSES] 
  - Maybe I left it at the gym? 
  [PLASTIC CLATTERS] 
  Well, what are these? 
  [SIGHS SOFTLY] 
  I wanted to know where your razor was because there were pills in them. 
  In my razor? 
  What are you talking about? 
  Why were you looking there? 
  Courtney said that you keep extras there as a safety net, so So you found them, and you didn't say anything? 
  I needed to know if you were using again, Zeke. 
  How about you just ask me? 
  Addicts lie you were the one that told me that. 
  You know who else is an addict? 
  Courtney. 
  You didn't think to question the source? 
  MICHAELA: So, they're not yours? 
  No. 
  And it feels like crap that you would set a trap for me, like I'm some criminal you're trying to catch. 
  No, I'm just trying to help you, Zeke. 
  What are you doing? 
  [KEYS JINGLE] 
  Would you believe me if I told you? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Anyone seen my Rangers hat? 
  Where you going? 
  Sam's mom is taking us to Coney Island for his birthday. 
  Uh honey, why didn't you ask us? 
  'Cause I knew you'd say no, and I really want to go. 
  I know it's tough, buddy, but we all need to be careful right now. 
  Here you go, squirt. 
  It was in my room. 
  [SIGHS] 
  They're not letting me. 
  Seriously? 
  Wow. 
  You're gonna hold your own son captive just because you're scared. 
  Olive, how about you let us handle this? 
  What's the point of even having five more years to live if I can't do anything fun, ever? 
  Cal [SIGHS] 
  BEN: [SIGHS] 
  Hey, hold up. 
  Where do you think you're going? 
  What? 
  So, now I'm a prisoner, too? 
  No, it's called grounded. 
  For ditching. 
  The school called again. 
  Did you think there weren't gonna be any consequences? 
  Returning to Adrian's cult when I explicitly told Would you stop calling it that?! 
  I was helping at the soup kitchen. 
  Regardless, there is no excuse for skipping school. 
  I'm done with school. 
  I'm taking the GED, and I am helping run the church's outreach. 
  - What? 
  - Absolutely not. 
  I'm old enough to get emancipated. 
  And I am so sick of you trying to control what I believe. 
  I'm sorry, what planet do you think you're living on? 
  This is not some broken home. 
  That's exactly what this is! 
  We are completely and utterly broken. 
  What do you think, Adrian's gonna somehow save you? 
  He's the very reason we live in fear. 
  Don't put your paranoia on him. 
  Paranoia? 
  Olive, our last Calling, there were dead bodies on the plane. 
  I am trying to stop that! 
  What's Adrian doing to help the passengers?! 
  Bringing hope to people! 
  Helping them see that death may not be final, that your return is a miracle. 
  Listen to yourself. 
  It's insane. 
  So, I can't believe in the miracle? 
  I live with two of them. 
  Okay, Olive Olive! 
  Adrian has to be stopped. 
  [ENGINES ROARING] 
  - [BEEP] 
  - Hour 23 since third injection. 
  First two were a bust, but, uh [SIGHS] 
  you got to keep trying, right? 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
  DNA still has a mutation. 
  That's another fail. 
  Third trial complete. 
  We missed you at Friday supper. 
  We worry about you, your mom and I. 
  I'm fine, Dad. 
  Just please tell Mom I lost track of time. 
  Tell me what's wrong, love. 
  I mean, only that I can't figure this out and lives are depending on me. 
  Hmm. 
  I seem to remember you being in the same pickle with your cancer work. 
  And what did you do then? 
  Talk to your immunologist friend at Boroughs Regional. 
  You said she helped you think about it in new ways. 
  Yeah, I haven't talked to her since I've been back. 
  There's some baggage there. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Sorry, my bad. 
  I thought you said lives depended on it. 
  [SIGHS] 
  So, you're going to sue me if your daughter runs my mission group? 
  It's called endangering a minor. 
  You brainwashed her. 
  Maybe I should sue you for assault. 
  She's ready to file for emancipation. 
  I assume she got that idea from you. 
  She sees the truth in my words. 
  - I can't be blamed for your fear. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  This is more than fear! 
  You're breeding zealots! 
  You're preaching that passengers can't die! 
  You're bending my words. 
  Just being part of your cult puts Olive and all of your followers in the cross hairs of 828 haters. 
  I have that updated parishioner list pulled up on your screen, if you want to see. 
  Give me a minute. 
  Listen to me. 
  Some of us had a Calling. 
  It was telling us to save the passengers. 
  The plane was covered in ash. 
  Have you been tested for post-traumatic stress? 
  Oh, come on, Adrian, don't act like you've never had a Calling. 
  You showed up when the plane exploded! 
  Ben, we're all being guided. 
  You're choosing to live in fear. 
  I choose to live in the miracle. 
  I couldn't care less where you choose to live. 
  Ignoring Callings is reckless. 
  Now, maybe I'm wrong, but what if I'm right and what we saw turns out to be another Xer attack on your church, or worse? 
  If my daughter gets hurt that's on you. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [DOOR SLAMS] 
  [TELEPHONES RINGING, INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Did you lose something in there? 
  [SIGHS] 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Take mine. 
  How about we share? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You think I'm trying to poison you? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Think of it as an olive branch. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Uh-oh. 
  You have that look on your face. 
  What's up? 
  Had a pretty bleak Calling. 
  Felt like a warning about the Xers. 
  [CELLPHONE RINGING] 
  Well, I'm happy to help. 
  Hey, Stone! 
  Guy just called. 
  He said he had information on that church attack. 
  - Didn't leave a name. 
  - Thank you. 
  [RINGING STOPS] 
  Hey, stop hounding me. 
  I got this. 
  Hey, chill, I'm just looking for an ETA. 
  Look, I'll get you all the information you need today. 
  Good, 'cause it's all coming together on our end. 
  [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] 
  Medieval Latin Literature? 
  Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations? 
  Oh, wow. 
  Your classes are wack. 
  Did you ask to see my schedule just so you can make fun of me, or ? 
  No, no, no to see if you'd have any time for me next semester. 
  That, I do. 
  [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  [SCOFFS] 
  No way. 
  They found it - Al-Zuras's journal. 
  - Really? 
  The guy who painted my mom's tarot cards - he wrote a journal? 
  - Yeah, apparently. 
  I was doing this deep dive on him, and this title popped up from some collection over at Yale. 
  Figured we'd get some answers. 
  About the Death Date. 
  Faculty lend only. 
  I'm getting it sent to your dad. 
  You know, Adrian isn't afraid of the Death Date. 
  He says you guys are proof that miracles exist. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Yeah, I've heard his theory on how we can't die. 
  Well you did come back once. 
  Honestly, Olive, I'm with your dad. 
  I think Adrian's full of it. 
  So, you don't believe in the miracle? 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  I'm not an angel or some god. 
  I came back the same exact person who left, except I didn't have a mom anymore. 
  Or friends or a home, for that matter. 
  Tell me how is that a miracle? 
  Hi, there. 
  Detective Stone, returning your call. 
  MAN: Hello. 
  Thanks for calling me back. 
  Isaiah? 
  I remembered a few things about my attack I think might be helpful. 
  Well, I'm here. 
  Come on in. 
  That's the thing. 
  I-I got called in to work. 
  Any way you can come to me? 
  Where are you at? 
  I'll be at Schimanski in Williamsburg. 
  Alright, see you then.

  MAN OVER P. A. : Blue Team to ICU, please. 
  Blue Team, ICU. 
  Dr. 
  Bates. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS, ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
  Thanks for coming. 
  Of course. 
  My pleasure. 
  Been hoping you'd reach out. 
  Yeah, no, I wouldn't have bothered you. 
  I just I've hit a wall. 
  Can we talk about it in my office, Doctor? 
  "Doctor"? 
  Really? 
  Alex. 
  So, the patient's corrected DNA in the retrovirus solution hasn't. 
  What? 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  It's just My God five years. 
  Can we please Can we just talk about us for a minute? 
  No, Alex, really, this is about the work. 
  Can I at least say I'm sorry? 
  The time for "I'm sorry" was when I came back. 
  It's been months. 
  You don't know how many times I picked up the phone. 
  Like that counts for anything. 
  Look, if I knew anyone else who could help me, you wouldn't be here. 
  I was on my way and then I just became terrified. 
  That Scott would find out? 
  That I was destroying my family for a fling in Jamaica. 
  [VOICE BREAKING] 
  A fling? 
  Is that what it was to you? 
  You just said it it's all about the work for you. 
  That's not true. 
  That is not true! 
  I loved you. 
  Vi, I'll always love you. 
  Okay. 
  Start with the retroviral serum. 
  Take me through the process step-by-step, working backwards. 
  I'm gonna need all the research you have on the Xers before I interview Isaiah. 
  Well, if he wouldn't talk after the church attack, why now? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe he had a change of heart. 
  Oh, could you have that church shut down, please? 
  Olive's threatening to join it full-time. 
  Mick, she wants to drop out of school. 
  I threatened to drop out once. 
  Yeah, remember? 
  I was gonna roadie for Skee Miller's punk band. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  Oh, yeah. 
  What did Dad do? 
  Uh, he got drunk with him. 
  Yeah, hand to God. 
  I came home, and my tatted-up boyfriend was shotgunning beers with my dad. 
  Kind of lost interest in him after that one. 
  So you're saying, if I have a beer with Adrian, it'll fix this? 
  There's no harm in keeping your enemies close. 
  [SIGHS] 
  So, how are things going with Zeke now that Courtney's gone? 
  Ha. 
  I'm starting to think I might gravitate towards the wrong guys. 
  Come on. 
  Zeke's a good guy. 
  So is Jared. 
  Whose side are you on? 
  Yours, always. 
  But I have noticed a pattern. 
  Come on. 
  You get to a point, and you pull away. 
  Am I wrong? 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you for the files.

  We're going so deep like the ocean Zeke? 
  What's happening? 
  Save the passengers! 
  It's now! 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  We are never gonna be getting in this way. 
  Well, we could do something else. 
  Okay, so, do you not want to go in? 
  - No, I-I said I did. 
  - Well, you also said you wanted to go to the church, so You're right. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I just didn't want to blow it with you. 
  Did I blow it? 
  - No. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Olive! 
  [ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  - You always this busy? 
  - Oh. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  We're doing a free champagne night. 
  It's my job to keep it flowing. 
  Gotcha. 
  Is there anywhere we can talk? 
  Look, I know you didn't want to come forward, but I promise you, we'll keep this under wraps. 
  This is your chance to help the passengers you revere so much. 
  I want that more than you know. 
  But I'm the only manager tonight, and we're running low on stock. 
  How about a glass while I run back and get some more? 
  I'm on duty. 
  Of course. 
  I'll I'll be right back. 
  Focused When you're with me, you're so focused What? 
  I have a confession to make. 
  I do believe in miracles. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Oh, really? 
  When you ain't callin' me back Makes me want it [CHUCKLES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  When we first came back, I wasn't sure why. 
  It all felt pointless. 
  But meeting your dad and and then you, I I'm happy for the first time since then. 
  I feel like I finally have something to live for. 
  So I wanted to say I do believe. 
  Just not in the way Adrian said. 
  I want you to have this. 
  What? 
  TJ, wow, this is beautiful. 
  I thought I lost everything of my mom's, but a neighbor held onto it. 
  She called it her Buddha bracelet. 
  This one was her favorite the Dharma wheel. 
  It symbolizes life is circular, that there's no beginning or end. 
  Well, I have something for you, too. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Where do you go, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Where do you go? 
  [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] 
  Where do you go when you're not by my side? 
  Where do you go? 
  Tell me the places you go in your mind Ben? 
  What are you doing here? 
  What do you mean? 
  I came for that drink. 
  With me? 
  I said all I need to say to you. 
  You texted me to meet you here. 
  Couldn't scare me with the lawsuit, so now you're trying to gaslight me? 
  - Well, I'm done. 
  - Hold on, hold on. 
  You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. 
  Get your hands off me. 
  I didn't text you. 
  I didn't even know I'd be here till an hour ago.

  [CHUCKLES] 
  Look. 
  Detective Stone she's up for a promotion. 
  I'm just trying to put together some ammo to try to help her win our case. 
  The ones you were on, I can get. 
  The rest that'd be a "no can do". 
  Hmm. 
  Well, last time I checked, online betting is a "no can do", too. 
  And if you've been erasing your history to cover it up that's a fireable offense. 
  Round 4 of retrovirus trial. 
  I tweaked the formula after talking it through with Alex. 
  And for the record, I'm not feeling very hopeful.

  - Yeah! 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Thank God you're here. 
  Any luck? 
  Keeps going to voicemail. 
  - Same with Ben and Olive? 
  - Yes. 
  Olive is out with her friend TJ, but she didn't say where. 
  Wait! 
  They're always texting. 
  But how can we access Olive's texts? 
  Her iPad she lets me play Minecraft on it. 
  Text me the address.

  Look around you! 
  Ben, what are you doing here? 
  What the hell is with all these passengers? 
  I'm trying to figure that out, too. 
  I contacted Adrian, like you said. 
  He texted me to meet him here. 
  Only it wasn't me! 
  Isaiah, my assistant, works here. 
  Said he needed to fill the place for some promotion. 
  I thought I misplaced my phone, but he must have taken it. 
  It's a trap. 
  He lured us here! 
  - But why? 
  - Ben? 
  [DISTORTED ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] 
  [FUSELAGE CREAKING] 
  You were in that Calling. 
  You lied to me!

  I just I didn't want to believe it could happen! 
  This is what the Calling was warning us about "save the passengers". 
  You didn't want to believe? 
  You hypocritical son of a bitch! 
  WOMAN: Did you see that? 
  Oh, no, no, don't drink the champagne! 
  Is he okay?

  I appreciate what you did in there. 
  We're cops, Mick. 
  That's what we do. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Hey. 
  I'm glad you're okay. 
  It's hard to believe that this is all the work of a Believer. 
  One lunatic is all it takes. 
  Yeah, well, it makes me sick that I wasn't there to help. 
  You're helping me now. 
  Wait, something's odd. 
  These aren't burns. 
  What do you mean? 
  This looks like frostbite. 
  Like from the cold? 
  Like what I had when I woke up in the cave? 
  Griffin drowned on dry land. 
  Is that what's happening to me? 
  I'm freezing to death? 
  I don't know. 
  You might be. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Well, I got Cal to bed. 
  I don't understand. 
  None of us do. 
  [SIGHS] 
  We couldn't see this coming. 
  Not me. 
  Not anyone. 
  He was so happy working with you, Dad. 
  Just today, he found a journal. 
  He thinks it's about the Death Date. 
  He had the library send it to your office, Dad. 
  You have to go get it. 
  I will, I promise. 
  Oh, my God.
