 Previously on "Manifest" Seriously? 
  No service? 
  - Same. 
  - [CABIN BELL DINGS] 
  I just wanted to say I'm so sorry for everything. 
  You don't have to apologize for something that happened to you. 
  I went to Evie's house, and I saw her parents. 
  It wasn't your fault. 
  The department did an investigation, and they cleared you. 
  You can't put yourself through that again. 
  You deserve better. 
  You think God wanted Jared to marry your best friend instead of you? 
  Where did that plane go for 5 1/2 years? 
  I suspect if anyone has answers, it's someone on that plane. 
  I still feel like a stranger in my own home. 
  You don't know that man. 
  You've never met him. 
  And you will never have to because you came home. 
  I need to know what Michaela Stone's doing, where she's going, who she's seeing. 
  Regular reports. 
  These are all the bodies that have been registered in the Long Island morgue in the last 48 hours. 
  There is no Kelly Taylor. 
  She's not in the system. 
  That's why the feds stepped in. 
  They wanted Kelly's body. 
  Where is she? 
  VANCE: Rest in peace, Kelly Taylor. 
  Cut surveillance on her home and the commercial space she owned. 
  Keep looking for connections among the other 19 that were there when the plane exploded. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Excuse me. 
  How soon are we landing? 
  I'll get back to you in a moment. 
  - SAANVI: Okay. 
  - Thank you. 
  Everything all right, Captain? 
  I'm gonna need you to keep the passengers calm. 
  Apparently, we've been diverted and law-enforcement will be meeting us on the tarmac. 
  Oh. 
  Why? 
  I have no idea. 
  I just know it's putting an extra hour between me and my beauty sleep. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  - [SIGHS] 
  We'll be landing soon. 
  [BELL DINGS] 
  Geez! 
  Hey, Saanvi, ready to go? 
  Do you know if Dr. 
  Feldman still works here? 
  He was a neurologist. 
  He's the head of the department still here. 
  Oh. 
  You know what? 
  You go ahead without me. 
  I think I'm gonna go say hi to him. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay. 
  [CHATTER, TELEPHONES RINGING] 
  I cannot believe what I'm seeing. 
  You made breakfast? 
  Well, I made something out of eggs. 
  We'll see how it goes. 
  I'm sure it's delicious. 
  You're up early. 
  What, are you scrapbooking? 
  You know me. 
  Pack rat. 
  Oh, by the way, your dad called. 
  Apparently, Cal is begging to stay up at the lake with him an extra day. 
  Next treatment's not till the weekend. 
  How many times did Cal want to go up there but was too sick? 
  I'm fine with that if you are. 
  Well means we'll have the house to ourselves while Olive's at school. 
  I am definitely fine with that. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Hey, you look ready to face the day. 
  Caffeination. 
  Oh, I like your overalls. 
  Romper. 
  What's the difference? 
  Romper, got it. 
  So, what are you doing after school? 
  Grandpa's giving me driving lessons. 
  Actually, we need to reschedule that. 
  Grandpa's gonna stay at the lake with Cal an extra day. 
  - Seriously? 
  - I could do it. 
  I-I need Grandpa's car. 
  That's the one I've been practicing on. 
  Now you can practice on ours. 
  It'll be good, right? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Never mind. 
  It's fine. 
  What did I do? 
  GRACE: Absolutely nothing. 
  Olive just has a hard time with change, and she's had a lot of it lately. 
  Like suddenly having a dad back in the picture, and one who doesn't know what a romper is. 
  You are doing fine. 
  Just give it time. 
  You'll learn to speak Olive. 
  Is it mostly this? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah, it's it's mostly that. 
  Bagels in the break room. 
  Is that garlic? 
  Don't tell Harrington. 
  I'm not gonna be stuck in a car with his stinky breath for six hours. 
  [TELEPHONES RINGING, CHATTER] 
  Okay, people, listen up. 
  We are still running support on the ATF op. 
  We've heard from their undercover. 
  The gun buy is going down tonight. 
  This is ATF's deal, so we're on standby until they make the call, then we do the bust, and ATF takes all the credit. 
  Now, Sheller, you're with Yan. 
  Wilson, you're with Larner. 
  And Stone, you're gonna be with Vasquez today. 
  All right, let's be safe out there. 
  Hey, what happened to Harrington? 
  Oh, pipe burst at his house. 
  Vasquez, you're NYPD lead on this. 
  Sir. 
  - You all good? 
  - Mm. 
  Never better. 
  DR. 
  FELDMAN: This is your patient? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  She showed an unusual blood marker, but now she's having visions, and apparently very realistic ones. 
  Well, there's activation in this area, the insular cortex. 
  Consistent with someone experiencing hallucinations. 
  And what would cause those - activations? 
  - It's hard to say. 
  It's not a well-understood area of the brain. 
  But look at this homeless patient in Room 810. 
  He was brought in after accosting people on the street. 
  Agitated, delusional, initial diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
  Here you can see he has similar brain activity, except the red indicates it's much more pronounced. 
  So, my, uh, patient is in early stages of schizophrenia? 
  I'd need to observe behavior to make a diagnosis. 
  I strongly suggest you have your patient see me for a consultation soon. 
  I'll see if I can convince her. 
  Thank you. 
  It was Bethany! 
  Bethany! 
  The flight attendant! 
  Bethany, Bethany! 
  The flight [ENGINES ROARING] 
  BEN: What is it? 
  Are you okay? 
  SAANVI: Not according to my brain scan. 
  - Did you find something? 
  - No. 
  I saw something. 
  Okay. 
  Something that wasn't there. 
  The neurologist called it a hallucination, but I think it was a signal of some kind. 
  Like how we all saw the plane? 
  Sort of. 
  But that was a flash of an image, and this was this was real. 
  I mean, obviously it wasn't. 
  It just I sound like I'm going crazy. 
  I'm the one person you don't have to say that to. 
  - What did you see? 
  - A woman. 
  She was all gray like a statue, and she left these wet footprints. 
  The footprints led me to the psych ward and then to a patient who grabbed me and said, "It was Bethany. 
  " - Bethany? 
  - The flight attendant. 
  - Bethany was what? 
  - I don't know. 
  I mean, this guy was on anti-psychotics and he was out of his mind. 
  And yet Bethany would've had access to the cockpit, the flight plan, the captain. 
  Maybe she knows how the plane disappeared. 
  Maybe she had something to do with it. 
  Well, we definitely need to talk to her. 
  I just have no idea where she is. 
  it's not like we exchanged numbers when Vance had us [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  But apparently you did. 
  Yeah, I started a database with information about every passenger. 
  Wanted to see if there was some pattern, something we're missing. 
  I have to be able to frame what happened to us in a way I understand or I'll go crazy. 
  I'm the one person you don't have to say that to. 
  [CELLPHONE RINGING] 
  [BEEPS] 
  Hey, love, what's up? 
  Can you, uh, um, come home? 
  I need to talk to you. 
  Here comes the merchandise. 
  AGENT: Something is blocking our audio signal from the inside, so we don't have ears. 
  But our U. C. checked in by phone, so all is well. 
  Copy that, ATF. 
  NYPD sits tight till you give the signal. 
  Don't hold your breath. 
  Buyer's not due until after dark. 
  [SIGHS] 
  That's what, six or seven hours? 
  Mm, the non-stop adrenaline of being a detective. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Loads of excitement in store for us. 
  We're gonna have to get lunch, snacks. 
  Maybe even a coffee at some point. 
  What are we doing for lunch? 
  Mm, there's a burger spot a couple blocks away. 
  Eh. 
  I know you like Italian. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Of course. 
  All right, Italian it is. 
  What's nearby? 
  Terraci's. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - We used to love that place. 
  You used to always get the oyster linguini. 
  Oh, it was the best. 
  What was it I always got? 
  The Chianti. 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  They were famous for something, though. 
  Yeah, the tiramisu. 
  We just never seemed to make it to dessert. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I could use a coffee. 
  I'll go get it. 
  [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  J [SIGHS] 
  Hey, you okay? 
  What is it? 
  What's wrong? 
  I think I have to sell the catering kitchen. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  What are you talking about? 
  We need the money, and maybe I can get a rental kitchen, - scale back on the staff. 
  - Whoa, whoa. 
  I'm gonna get something soon. 
  I talked to the new head of the math department at SUNY, and there may be a faculty position in the spring, and in the meantime, I'm looking at possible guest lecture gigs. 
  We're gonna be fine. 
  No, we're not. 
  Ben I'm so sorry. 
  This is It's a lot bigger than that. 
  I shut down when you disappeared. 
  But the rest of the world kept moving and the bills kept rolling in, and I almost lost our house. 
  And then the insurance money came in. 
  They paid out the death benefit, and now they want it back. 
  It's half a million dollars. 
  How much do we have left? 
  There's nothing left. 
  I'm so sorry, Ben. 
  I-I paid off the mortgage. 
  And then with Cal's old medical bills and - Hey. 
  - and the property taxes - Hey, hey, hey, - and the car hey, hey, hey. 
  It's okay. 
  We'll use the equity in the house to pay back the No, there isn't any! 
  I took out a HELOC to start my business. 
  I don't see any way out of this. 
  Grace. 
  I'm back. 
  And you are everything to me everything. 
  You've had to do it all for so long. 
  We're gonna figure it out. 
  We're gonna figure this out. 
  When I'm famous, I'm gonna have to look this good every single day. 
  It's gonna be exhausting. 
  Easy solve. 
  Don't be famous. 
  - She's famous. 
  - Really? 
  For what? 
  For absolutely nothing I've done. 
  Come on, you have the most epic life of anyone I know. 
  Stuff happens to me, not because of me. 
  Her father and her brother were on that magic plane. 
  Whoa. 
  That must be crazy. 
  It is, yeah. 
  I mean, it's great, of course. 
  - WOMAN: Excuse me, I'm ready. 
  - Hang on. 
  I have to help a girl out. 
  Oh, my God, I just died everywhere. 
  Do you see you? 
  Yeah. 
  For real, you have to have this. 
  Excuse me. 
  How much is everything? 
  It's $120. 
  I'll have to think about it. 
  Cool. 
  I'm here, famous girl. 
  I thought you got allowance on Mondays. 
  Yeah, I used to. 
  I don't know if things have changed or my mom just forgot, and it seems a little petty to ask. 
  Well, I'm guessing this Olive could ask. 
  'Cause she's in control. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I think we should go. 
  All right. 
  Excuse me. 
  You're gonna need to come with me. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I miss anything? 
  Text from Harrington thanking you for tickets to the game. 
  Yeah, so much for a burst pipe. 
  - Yeah, I, uh - You what? 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm worried. 
  I-I need to make sure that everything's okay with you. 
  So you engineered us being alone together in a car for six hours? 
  Why not just ask me at the precinct? 
  I've been asking you ever since you've been back. 
  But you won't give me a straight answer. 
  It's complicated, Jared! 
  And it's painful, but it is my problem that I need to deal with alone. 
  - I just want to help you. 
  - [WHOOSHING] 
  But you won't trust me enough to tell me what the hell's going on with you. 
  Michaela. 
  GRAY WOMAN: [WHISPERING] 
  Save him. 
  Save him! 
  Save him. 
  Save him. 
  The undercover his comms went out, right? 
  Yeah, but ATF's not worried. 
  No, they don't know what's going on in there. 
  - I think he might be in trouble. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - MICHAELA: We need to go in. 
  - Are you crazy? 
  ATF is calling this. 
  It's their operation. 
  The The buyers aren't even Jared, you need to trust me, okay? 
  We need to save him. 
  How can you possibly know that? 
  I just know! 
  This is NYPD. 
  We're going in. 
  All units, we're going in now. 
  [CRASH] 
  NYPD! 
  Everybody down! 
  Down on the floor! 
  [GUNSHOTS] 
  ATF. 
  Drop it. 
  What the hell just happened here? 
  You're okay? 
  Okay? 
  No, I'm not okay. 
  My cover's blown. 
  The whole operation is botched. 
  You were supposed to wait for my signal. 
  So, who made the call? 
  I did. 
  [DOORBELL BUZZES] 
  You. 
  Row 8. 
  Laptop girl. 
  I just met a very disturbed man who said that you did something on the plane. 
  What does he know? 
  You found him? 
  VANCE: Who's this? 
  Emotionally disturbed person arrested three days ago, then shipped off to a psych ward. 
  He's not on the manifest for 828. 
  Why do I care? 
  NYPD ran his prints, but couldn't I. 
  D. 
  him, but once his prints were in the system, it triggered a match in our database. 
  H-His fingerprints were found on the airplane? 
  Inside the cargo hatch door. 
  We did an amino test. 
  They were fresh when the plane landed. 
  There was a stowaway on 828. 
  - [CABIN BELL DINGS] 
  - Thomas. 
  Something's gone wrong, hasn't it? 
  They're diverting the plane, and police will be there when we land. 
  They'll know I'm not a real flight attendant. 
  They're going to arrest me. 
  - What if you get arrested, too? 
  - Shh, shh, shh. 
  Stay calm. 
  Think about Leo, okay? 
  He'll be waiting for you in the city. 
  - Okay. 
  - MAN: Excuse me. 
  Stewardess? 
  Oh, thank you, sir. 
  We're going to an airport in the middle of nowhere. 
  Less security around the perimeter, which is good. 
  I'm gonna need you to go in here. 
  This leads to the cargo hold. 
  Once we touch down and come to a stop, I want you to climb out onto the landing gear and jump down. 
  And then what? 
  And then you run. 
  [JET ENGINE ROARS] 
  There was a stowaway on our plane? 
  His name is Thomas. 
  He's my cousin Leo's boyfriend. 
  But why did you smuggle him out? 
  You have any idea how dangerous being gay in Jamaica can be? 
  When their friend was beaten to death, Leo and Thomas posted a video calling out the local police for not investigating and became targets themselves. 
  They couldn't get plane tickets? 
  My cousin had one, but Thomas couldn't get a passport in time, and his life was in danger. 
  I had to help. 
  Leo and Thomas were in love, and Leo is family. 
  He never made it to the U. 
  S. 
  Disappeared a few years after we went missing. 
  You did the best you could. 
  The rest of us were together when they told us five years had passed in the blink of an eye. 
  Imagine what it was like for Thomas to find out. 
  All alone, in a strange country. 
  Well, we have to figure out a way to help him. 
  Half a million dollars. 
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  Did you find anything? 
  I did. 
  But that's only because my smart wife made so many smart moves. 
  We can take out a small business loan, invest it, and use the interest we earn to pay back the insurance money as slowly as we like. 
  Wait, don't we have to pay it all back at once? 
  They'd like us to think we do. 
  But they didn't exactly have a Flight 828 clause in our insurance policy, so they're forced to take whatever we offer as long as we pay it back in good faith. 
  Mmm. 
  This should go on your menu. 
  You're amazing. 
  I sat here a few hours and ran some numbers. 
  But you? 
  You spent five years building a business from scratch and making really hard decisions to keep our house, hold our family together. 
  You're amazing. 
  Mm. 
  You like the math I did, huh? 
  That was some really sexy math. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  That might be the first time those two words have ever been said together. 
  Very. 
  Sexy. 
  Math. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Mm. 
  - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
  Oh, I got to get that. 
  I think your dad is the only one who leaves me voicemails anymore, and since he's with Cal - Come on. 
  - OLIVE: Hi, Mom Probably just wants to talk about his new fishing lure. 
  Come upstairs. 
  Or right here. 
  I don't care. 
  It's Olive. 
  Ah. 
  She wants me to pick her up at Bluemercury. 
  She sounds upset. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'll do it. 
  Really? 
  You sure? 
  I need to work on my Olive speak. 
  Perfect opportunity. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - Good point. 
  And later, let's get back to that sexy math stuff. 
  Oh, 100%. 
  RIOJAS: [MUFFLED] 
  You know, you're not gonna stonewall your way out of this. 
  [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
  All of that went out the window. 
  [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
  [RINGING] 
  - Hey. 
  - MICHAELA: I just botched a huge operation. 
  - What happened? 
  - I had a vision. 
  There There was this woman. 
  She was gray like stone, and she had these wings. 
  And she told me to "save him," but she was wrong. 
  He He didn't need saving. 
  Wait. 
  A gray woman? 
  Saanvi may have had the same vision. 
  She did? 
  I hope everything's okay for her, because it really screwed things up here. 
  Jared could lose his job. 
  I have to come clean and tell them what really happened. 
  Are you kidding me?! 
  We come clean now, we could legitimately end up in some government psych facility for the rest of our lives. 
  Then I need to at least tell Jared, because it's just not fair to let him take the fall for this. 
  No, Mick, we've been lying to the NSA. 
  If we start telling the people we care about what's happening to us, we'll force them to lie, too. 
  Call Saanvi. 
  She can help you make sense of this. 
  She's working on some theories. 
  You have to just accept the consequences with Jared. 
  Mick. 
  You cannot tell him what's going on. 
  [BEEPS] 
  Hi, Dr. 
  Feldman. 
  Quick question about the patient in Room 810. 
  I'd love to have a consult with him before he's discharged, - and I was wondering if - He's not getting discharged. 
  No one showed up to claim him, so he's being moved to a state-run facility in a few hours. 
  Oh, okay. 
  Thank you. 
  How'd it go? 
  We've got a big problem. 
  [SIGHS] 
  What can I help you find today? 
  Oh, just my daughter. 
  Brown hair, adorable, answers to the name Olive. 
  Olive Stone? 
  Yeah. 
  I'm afraid we caught her shoplifting. 
  Oh. 
  Where is she? 
  In the back. 
  But I thought her dad was already here. 
  There they are. 
  Dad, what are you doing? 
  Hi. 
  Uh, I'm Danny. 
  - Grace's - I know. 
  Sorry. 
  Uh, Olive called me. 
  She didn't really know what to Thanks. 
  I can take her from here. 
  Okay. 
  I'll just - Bye, Olive. 
  - Thanks. 
  BEN: [ECHOING] 
  Looks great. 
  It's actually really well balanced. 
  - Look. 
  - So, what do you think? 
  Should we take it for a test flight? 
  Okay. 
  This is beta test one. 
  - Ready? 
  - Ready. 
  Okay. 
  - Launch! 
  - Hey! 
  No, no, no, no, no! 
  No! 
  [SIGHS] 
  I can't believe he just did that! 
  Oh, he didn't mean to, sweetie. 
  It's never gonna fly now. 
  - Come here, let me show you something. 
  - It's ruined. 
  No, it's never gonna fly. 
  But it will float. 
  See? 
  You didn't even realize you made the world's coolest boat. 
  Thank you, Daddy. 
  You always make everything better. 
  Hey. 
  What happened? 
  ATF is pissed. 
  They're starting a full investigation. 
  Meantime, I'm suspended. 
  I need to tell them this was my fault. 
  - I am the one who - How is that gonna help anything? 
 
 
 
  I'm the one that made the call. 
  You don't have to take the fall to protect me, Jared. 
  Yes, I do. 
  Okay? 
  I can't help it. 
  That is the last thing that I want. 
  Then tell me what's really going on. 
  You saw something. 
  Or heard something. 
  I saw it on your face. 
  What was it? 
  I heard a gunshot, so I thought that maybe I was right there. 
  There was no gunshot. 
  I know there's more to the story here, just like I know there's more to the story about those kidnapped girls and the lady who killed that passenger from the plane. 
  If you don't want to talk to me, I get it. 
  But you got to talk to someone. 
  You need help. 
  Actually, ye-yeah, there might be somebody I know. 
  Ben said she might be able to help. 
  Then go. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Grace? 
  Hey, hold on. 
  Honey, is this something you've done before? 
  No. 
  Never, okay? 
  I swear. 
  Did I ever tell you about the boomerang? 
  The what? 
  When I was 15, I stole a boomerang. 
  It was a really cool boomerang. 
  Why'd you do it? 
  I don't know. 
  I just think I felt like everything in my life was out of whack. 
  And at the time, it just seemed like a way to take the reins of something, anything, you know? 
  What did Grammy do? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Not enough, actually. 
  I remember thinking if she yelled at me or grounded me for a month, at least I could be mad at her, put some of my guilt someplace else, but she just looked at me and said "Everybody deserves one free pass. 
  " [VOICE BREAKING] 
  I don't deserve a free pass. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  Do you plan on stealing again? 
  No. 
  Never. 
  So take the free pass. 
  Dad, I'm sorry. 
  I'm so sorry that I called Danny instead of you. 
  I just I didn't want you to I know, I know. 
  No, you don't. 
  Because you don't know what a total screw up I am. 
  And Danny knows I'm a mess, but you still see me as this sweet 10-year-old little girl, and I'm not. 
  I'm so not her anymore. 
  No. 
  No, in some ways, you're this whole new person. 
  And you know what? 
  I really love this whole new person. 
  And sometimes I might not be great at communicating with her, but I want her to know whenever she needs help, she can always call me, no matter what. 
  Okay? 
  Okay. 
  Thank you. 
  Could we keep this whole thing just between us? 
  I've been such a pain in the ass to Mom, and she's been through a lot. 
  And she will never, never understand this. 
  Please. 
  Okay. 
  It'll be our secret. 
  Okay. 
  Thank you, Dad. 
  But if you ever steal anything ever again, there'll be hell to pay. 
  Even if it's a really cool boomerang? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I think we both know there's no such thing. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  I still think this is a bad idea. 
  It's the only way Thomas is gonna get out of here. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - We're gonna get caught. 
  Someone's bound to recognize a couple of 828ers just traipsing around here together. 
  These nurses work long shifts. 
  Let's just hope we find someone who doesn't spend all their free time watching the 24-hour news channel. 
  May I help you? 
  Uh, discharge orders for a psych patient. 
  And you're the mother? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Little surprised the doctor released him. 
  He's on a lot of Haldol. 
  - Maybe I should double check. 
  - Uh, well, his mom here is a physician's assistant. 
  Guess the doctor thought that he'd be better off with family in this case. 
  But, I mean, if you disagree Oh. 
  Room 810. 
  - [ALARM BLARING] 
  MAN: All security - What's going on? 
  We're on lockdown. 
  A patient tripped the alarm trying to get out. 
  [ALARM CONTINUES] 
  Get him back into his room. 
  He's gone. 
  Thomas! 
  SAANVI: Do you see those? 
  What? 
  We have to go. 
  Come on. 
  WOMAN: Attention, all staff and personnel, this is not a drill. 
  Please follow standard lockdown protocol. 
  Search the room. 
  Attention, all staff and personnel Want to see the doctor in charge of the John Doe who escaped. 
  He's actually not a John Doe anymore. 
  His mother showed up. 
  What? 
  Where is she? 
  She was just here. 
  [TIRES SCREECH] 
  Michaela? 
  What are you doing here? 
  I came here to talk to you. 
  I think that we might've seen the same - You can talk later. 
  - Okay, look, we really need your help. 
  We got to go. 
  [TIRES SQUEAL] 
  SAANVI: So, Thomas would be the perfect guinea pig for Vance. 
  No identity, no family. 
  In Vance's mind, Thomas doesn't exist. 
  Yeah, well, Vance is wrong, okay? 
  We have to find Thomas before he does. 
  Do you have any idea where he'd go? 
  All our plans changed once the plane was rerouted. 
  I gave him my phone, but it was useless. 
  Did he know anyone else in the city? 
  No one. 
  He and my cousin planned to meet up and start a whole new life. 
  Well, how did they plan to connect once they got to New York? 
  I never even asked. 
  God, I wish I had. 
  We need to look for wet footprints. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  - It's how I found Thomas. 
  I saw a woman. 
  I The gray woman with wings? 
  No, she didn't have wings. 
  She left wet footprints. 
  That's what led me to Thomas. 
  So, we're seeing the same gray woman, but I'm seeing an angel and you're seeing wet footprints? 
  Like she had been standing in water. 
  No, it just doesn't make sense. 
  - The Angel of the Waters. 
  - Who? 
  The statue at the top of Bethesda Fountain. 
  She has wings and water at her feet. 
  And she's a big part of "Angels in America," Leo's favorite play. 
  So you think that's where he went? 
  Thomas may not know New York, but he sure as hell knows Tony Kushner. 
  The angel told me to save him. 
  She meant Thomas. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Hey, you're back. 
  Yep. 
  Everything good? 
  Good. 
  Fine. 
  How's Olive? 
  Hanging out in her room. 
  Were you seriously not gonna tell me about our daughter shoplifting? 
  You don't think that's something that I would want to know? 
  Olive asked me not to. 
  I'm trying to gain her trust back. 
  She's 15 and in trouble. 
  Of course she asked you not to. 
  Yeah, I Wait, how'd you find out? 
  That's not the point, Ben. 
  Danny. 
  You talked to Danny. 
  I thought you ended it with him. 
  I did. 
  He only called me to tell me what happened with Olive. 
  He felt awful. 
  Ben, you can't keep secrets from me about my own daughter! 
  Our daughter. 
  Of course that's what I meant. 
  I want you to be half of this parenting team. 
  I cannot do it alone, but neither can you. 
  Trust me, you have no idea what we've been through with her. 
  "We"? 
  Meaning you and Danny? 
  Ben, you weren't here. 
  I am now! 
  And neither one of you seem to be able to let this guy go. 
  But maybe it's not fair for me to ask you to. 
  Ben It's okay. 
  I'm gonna get some air. 
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  Thomas! 
  Thomas, it's me. 
  - Bethany! 
  - Oh! 
  Oh, my God! 
  She seemed so real. 
  It's fascinating. 
  Feds are gonna be on our tail. 
  We got to get him out of here. 
  THOMAS: When I found my way here, everybody was telling me it was five years later. 
  I thought I was going crazy. 
  Somebody called the cops. 
  It's okay. 
  You're safe now. 
  Sorry, guys, but we got to go right now. 
  No. 
  I cannot go. 
  You've been given massive doses of Haldol. 
  We need to get you somewhere where you can detox. 
  But we cannot leave. 
  Leo is meeting me here. 
  He's not coming. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  A lot has happened. 
  Five years? 
  - That is true? 
  - MICHAELA: It is true. 
  The three of us were on the plane, as well. 
  We all lost five years. 
  I am so sorry, baby. 
  I spoke to my mom. 
  Leo disappeared two years after the plane left. 
  No. 
  No! 
  - No! 
  - I'm so, so sorry, baby. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Thomas, we need to get you somewhere safe. 
  I cannot go! 
  If he is alive MICHAELA: Thomas, look at me. 
  I am a cop. 
  If your boyfriend is alive, I am gonna help you find him, I promise you that, but right now, we have to go because there are federal agents looking for you, and if they find you, you'll be arrested as a stowaway. 
  SAANVI: Not just you. 
  If you're found, Bethany will go to prison, too, so we have to go right now. 
  Where? 
  Where can we go? 
  It has to be somewhere off of Vance's radar. 
  He is watching all of us. 
  THOMAS: What is this place? 
  MICHAELA: It's a boiler room, or it was. 
  It hasn't been used in ages. 
  How'd you find it? 
  Kelly owned the building. 
  It'll be tied up in probate for years. 
  - BETHANY: So basically, no one's coming - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  down here any time soon? 
  Just us. 
  And my brother. 
  I'm gonna go get some supplies a cot, some blankets. 
  And some water with electrolytes. 
  He's coming off a ton of drugs he didn't need. 
  It worked. 
  We completed the calling. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm just not sure that's a good thing. 
  How could it not be? 
  Thomas is safe. 
  You're harboring a fugitive in there. 
  Do you not realize we're being watched by the government, - the media - It's all worth it. 
  Is it? 
  Because it sounds like "the calling" really screwed things up for Jared. 
  That was my fault. 
  I got the calling wrong. 
  These callings are pulling you in deeper and deeper. 
  And what if the voices are bad? 
  You can't just follow them blindly. 
  I don't think we have a choice. 
  [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  You bring me 'round When I'm down You take my breath Away You lift my eyes Through blue skies You make me want To cry You make me feel Alive What do you want from me? 
  Ohh, ohh, ohh
