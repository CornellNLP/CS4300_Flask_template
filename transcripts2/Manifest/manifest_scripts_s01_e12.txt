  Find her. 
  I don't think we're supposed to find anyone. 
  I think I'm having someone else's calling. 
  No matter what I do, I'm the bad guy, and I'm tired of it. 
  So we're not doing this. 
  MICHAELA: He loves you. 
  And I love him. 
  I just hope it'll be enough. 
  The Major would like a word. 
  I knew. 
  It's like the subway tunnels, Dad. 
  They're right here. 
  SAANVI: I think I found the Major's Holy Grail. 
  They found that some of the passengers are more sensitive to the callings. 
  Cal. 
  If the Major finds out what he can do We got to make sure she never does. 
  Cal! 
  [TIRES SQUEAL] 
  No, no, no, no. 
  I said no police, damn it. 
  - [BRAKES SQUEAL] 
  - [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] 
  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  Whoa, whoa. 
  Sir, sir. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  I-I'm Ben Stone. 
  Thi This is my house, my family Calm down. 
  Let me see some I. D. 
  [SIGHS] 
  OLIVE: [SIGHS] 
  He's, uh He's small, and he's been really he's been really sick. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  I have a photo. 
  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  JACKSON: These are just elimination prints. 
  GRACE: Mm-hmm. 
  Thank you. 
  Mrs. 
  Stone, does your son have a history of running away? 
  No, no. 
  Uh, well, he did go off once recently. 
  Anything going on at home that might make him want to leave? 
  His father moved out two weeks ago. 
  - That's Benjamin Stone? 
  - Yes. 
  Who was with Cal on Flight 828? 
  Yes, yes, but they talk every day. 
  They see each other all the time. 
  Cal didn't go off to see Ben. 
  Something must've happened. 
  Any sense of what that might be? 
  [STAMMERS, SIGHS] 
  Mrs. 
  Stone, are you aware of someone that might want to harm Cal? 
  No. 
  - But his father thinks - [DOOR OPENS] 
  Grace. 
  Grace. 
  Oh, my God. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  JACKSON: Mr. 
  Stone. 
  Yes? 
  Your ex-wife was about to No, we're we're still married. 
  Your wife was about to share a theory of yours about someone who might want to harm your son. 
  Well, Cal has been a bit of a celebrity since we came back, a lot of unwanted attention, but no, nothing specific. 
  Mr. 
  Stone, can you tell me your whereabouts this evening? 
  - I was with my sister, - No, this - has nothing to do with Ben. 
  - Detective Michaela Stone. 
  I can assure you. 
  Michaela, what are you doing here? 
  - [GRUNTS] 
  - Where is he? 
  - Where is he?! 
  - Who? 
  Don't mess with me, Autumn. 
  Where's Cal? 
  Michaela, I swear to you, I have zero idea what you're talking about! 
  We know that you're the mole, Autumn. 
  We know that you have been working with the Major, whoever the hell that is. 
  So if you don't have Cal here, I'm guessing the Major does. 
  You are gonna tell me exactly where he is. 
  Michaela, you have to believe me. 
  The hell I do. 
  You have been lying to us since the moment you got here. 
  We brought you in, Autumn. 
  We protected you. 
  Michaela, I don't know what you're talking about. 
  [CELLPHONE RINGS] 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  Olive, what's up? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Hey. 
  The cops. 
  They think it's Dad. 
  You need to come. 
  Yeah, I'll be right there. 
  - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  - You, too. 
  Come on. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  You've got it all wrong.

  [TELEPHONE RINGS] 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Police activity at the Ben Stone residence. 
  The call was for a missing child. 
  [TELEPHONE RINGS] 
  You've been monitoring the chatter? 
  They've got an ECT team on site. 
  They're canvassing the neighborhood. 
  They'll focus on the family first. 
  Monitor the situation and report back. 
  I need to keep her apprised. 
  Copy. 
  Go in closer. 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  Hey, can you keep an eye on her? 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  [SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
  [DOOR CREAKS] 
  We never should've called the cops. 
  Who doesn't call the cops when their child goes missing? 
  I know. 
  It sounds Bu-But the people who I think are behind this are higher up on the food chain way higher. 
  We-We're playing into their hands by having the cops here. 
  What does that even mean? 
  - [DOOR CREAKS] 
  - Hey. 
  Um, I have Autumn in the car. 
  - She's denying everything. 
  - Of course she is. 
  Yeah, my thoughts exactly. 
  Who's Autumn? 
  Is she involved in this? 
  We think so. 
  She's a passenger from 828. 
  We're all but certain the Major sent her to spy on us. 
  The Major? 
  I-I'm sorry. 
  She's been secretly investigating Flight 828, the passengers us. 
  What does she want with our son? 
  Grace, you know that ever since the flight, we have been hearing things, some of us seeing things. 
  And this is happening to Cal? 
  In a sense. 
  But he seems to be experiencing them more strongly than anyone else. 
  Why wouldn't you tell me this? 
  I-I'm sorry. 
  I Ben was trying to protect you, Grace. 
  We thought that they were dangerous to you, to non-passengers. 
  When we shared the details, it got people killed. 
  It happened to the friends of this other passenger. 
  - Harvey Stein. 
  - It almost happened to Jared. 
  But it didn't, so, now we think hope that it was a tragic fluke. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Okay, the era of you protecting me, that's over. 
  If you know something that will help us find Cal, I want to hear about it. 
  Ben, I would rather die than not do everything in my power to save our son. 
  [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
  We somehow think the Major knows about Cal. 
  Knows what, exactly? 
  That he draws things. 
  Yeah. 
  And sometimes, the things that he draws, they've happened already, but he couldn't have known. 
  Other times, they haven't happened yet, and when they do What What do you mean he draws them? 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  BEN: Look. 
  This is Thomas. 
  He was a stowaway on 828. 
  Cal knew knew his name, even where he was hiding. 
  And this is a place where we found a group of missing passengers. 
  And this Is that? 
  Us. 
  Right now. 
  Now what? 
  [ANIMALS HOWLING] 
  GRACE: God, he looks terrified. 
  Yeah, but just because he drew it doesn't necessarily mean that You said yourself all these other drawings came true. 
  Why shouldn't we assume the same of this one? 
  Wait, wait, wait. 
  There's more pages, guys. 
  Is that the Major? 
  Maybe. 
  I don't know. 
  Okay. 
  There's got to be something else in there. 
  There's a page missing. 
  Maybe he took it with him. 
  Or someone stole it. 
  Autumn, sh-she was at the apartment with Cal. 
  She was looking at his sketches. 
  So if she's got the page, I'll get it back. 
  Wait. 
  All these trees, lake, rocks. 
  I think he left us a map. 
  It looks like upstate, but where? 
  Wait. 
  Go back. 
  I recognize this. 
  Last summer, I was in Tannersville in the Catskills, the Town Square. 
  This flagpole, the statue under the steeple of the church - it looked just like this. 
  - You're positive? 
  No, it's a crayon drawing. 
  I'm not positive, but it could be. 
  Then we should get up there. 
  I mean, if you're right, the other drawings could be landmarks that'll show up. 
  What about the 19 cops in our house? 
  No, they can't know any of this. 
  We have to assume the Major has eyes and ears up and down law enforcement. 
  - We have to get rid of them. 
  - How? 
  Let me make a call. 
  Grace. 
  Ben. 
  Hey, Cal's fine. 
  He's fine. 
  He's with Steve. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Did you talk to him? 
  Yeah, I just saw him. 
  He's fast asleep. 
  Steve had his phone off. 
  - He had no idea we'd be calling. 
  - Oh, God. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hey, Chris. 
  - Hey. 
  I didn't know you were working this case. 
  I'm friends with the family, so I thought I'd help out. 
  False alarm? 
  Yeah, kid's with his grandfather. 
  You know, the whole family, they've been a bit edgy since the plane came back. 
  I think they just jumped to the worst-case scenario. 
  You sure about this? 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  - [CELLPHONE CLICKS] 
  That picture was taken today? 
  Yeah, 10 minutes ago. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Okay, well, good news, then. 
  - Great news. 
  - Mm. 
  All right, guys, wrap it up. 
  False alarm. 
  Thanks so much. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  I'm just glad your son is safe. 
  Thank you. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Thank you. 
  Yeah, no biggie. 
  Just my career. 
  We have a suspect in the car. 
  We think that she knows where Cal went. 
  We can take her in and work that angle. 
  You want to take a kidnapping suspect into the precinct after I just told half the NYPD there's no missing kid? 
  She has tons of open warrants from before 828. 
  Once we get her in the box, we can ask her whatever we want. 
  Uh, no, we're sending the cops away why? 
  Because we know more than they do. 
  Trust me. 
  All right, Grace and I are gonna start the drive up to Tannersville. 
  We'll look for Cal's clues along the way. 
  MICHAELA: Hey, borrow a car. 
  Anything registered to you is gonna tip off the Major by the time you hit the first tollbooth. 
  All right. 
  What is it? 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - Uh Danny has a truck. 
  Let's go get it. 
  I'll text him. 
  [SMOOCHES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I want to help. 
  You're home base. 
  Grandpa's on his way. 
  Lock the door. 
  Open for him but nobody else. 
  If either one of you sees anything or hears anything, you call us ASAP. 
  Hey, we're gonna find him, all right? 
  This is gonna be okay. 
  [SMOOCHES] 
  Lock the door. 
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  So, this is his other vehicle? 
  He's outdoorsy. 
  He has a lot of gear. 
  - [RADIO BEEPS] 
  - REPORTER: Expect low, frigid temperatures for the next four days. 
  An hours-long high-speed chase throughout the boroughs ended in tragedy early this morning. 
  The driver, the primary suspect in a brazen double homicide and theft of an armored car, plunged the stolen vehicle into the East River. 
  Well, at least for once, it's not about Flight 828. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - [RADIO SHUTS OFF] 
  We should keep it on. 
  We might hear something helpful. 
  If there's news, Michaela will have it first. 
  I need to think. 
  [SIGHS] 
  When you supposedly escaped, why'd you go to Ben, of all people? 
  Okay, how about this one, then? 
  You and I have not hung out once since you've shown up. 
  Then, all of a sudden, you're knocking on my door when Cal just so happens to be there. 
  And now Cal is in danger I think because of you. 
  I also think that you took a page out of Cal's sketchbook. 
  You know, for a con artist, your poker face sucks hard. 
  I need the page, Autumn. 
  You're gonna tell me where it is. 
  A boy's life is on the line. 
  Even if I knew something, I could never tell you. 
  She'd find out. 
  She would know. 
  What does she have on you, Autumn? 
  It can't just be about a few old identity-theft warrants. 
  It's not just about me. 
  What does that mean? 
  Autumn, who else is it about? 
  [COMPUTER BEEPING] 
  NYPD left the Stone residence, but so have Grace and Ben Stone. 
  We're tracking their vehicle, but it's been stationary for a while. 
  They may have swapped cars. 
  Get some bodies in the field. 
  Generate a list of potential vehicles family members, colleagues, friends. 
  That's not all. 
  Autumn Cox is in police custody. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  [DIALING] 
  It's Jansen. 
  I need to speak to the Major. 
  It's urgent. 
  This is it Tannersville. 
  The statue, the steeple, the flagpole it all matches. 
  This is incredible. 
  He drew every last detail. 
  Let's park back there, show his picture around. 
  MICHAELA: How many years ago was that? 
  Can you spell that last name? 
  Yeah, and and do they have an address? 
  Great. 
  Thank you. 
  You've been a lot of help. 
  [SHIVERS] 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  How are you cold? 
  - They just jacked the heat up in here. 
  - I don't know, but listen. 
  That was Social Services. 
  Autumn had a kid, a daughter. 
  She's 8 years old, which means she was a toddler when the plane disappeared. 
  - Really? 
  - She already lost custody due to a prison stint back in 2011, but the woman that she asked me to track down, Clarissa Ford? 
  It turns out that that's the kid's foster mom. 
  Does she still have the kid? 
  No, she was adopted out four years ago, but that's who she's talking about, Jared. 
  "It's not just about me. 
  " She's talking about her kid. 
  The The Major must've tracked her down. 
  That's her leverage. 
  So Autumn spies on the passengers, and in return, the Major reunites her with her daughter. 
  That's why she's so scared. 
  She doesn't want to do anything that might jeopardi Yeah? 
  We've tracked down the kid, too, so we can make a deal with Autumn. 
  Well, we better move fast. 
  The Feds just voided her warrants. 
  What are you talking about? 
  Whoever this Major is, she's pulling strings. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - It's only a matter of time before we have to cut Autumn loose. 
  [SIGHS] 
  - Excuse me. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi, there. 
  Hi. 
  We're looking for our son. 
  Did you see him? 
  Excuse me, sir, his name is Cal. 
  - Excuse, me, sir, hi. 
  - No? 
  [SIGHS] 
  My son is lost. 
  Did you maybe see him? 
  No? 
  Sir, have you seen this little boy? 
  Please, I-I-I'm looking for this boy. 
  His name is Cal. 
  You have no idea what it's like, knowing your child is this close and not being able to see her, begging this woman The Major. 
  I told her that Cal was special, that somehow he knew things he shouldn't have known. 
  Cal's sketchbook you tore a page out of it, a picture of where he was going. 
  You sold out another child to get your own. 
  I didn't give her the drawing. 
  I swear to you. 
  Autumn, you can make this right still. 
  I can help you see your child. 
  Do you know where she is? 
  I know exactly where she is, but you have to help us find Cal first. 
  I can't take the risk. 
  If the Major finds out, - I don't know what she'll do. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  We're out of time, Mick. 
  Captain wants to kick her. 
  You know we cannot keep her without federal warrants. 
  Give me one more minute. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  Flight 828 it happened for a reason. 
  I believe that it brought us together so that we could help each other, trust each other. 
  Autumn, look at me. 
  Do you really think you can trust the Major? 
  Sweetheart, why don't you come downstairs? 
  I made us some soup. 
  This can't be happening again. 
  [SIGHS] 
  This is exactly how I felt the last time. 
  Hey, come here. 
  Huh? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Your parents are on this. 
  They're not gonna stop until they find him. 
  - Mm? 
  - [SIGHS] 
  And neither am I. 
  I can feel him, just like the last time. 
  I think he's in danger and he's terrified and it's like he's trying to send me, like - Oh, my God. 
  - What is it? 
  There's this secret place, a ledge. 
  When When we were little, we used to leave messages for each other. 
  Grandpa. 
  Son of a gun. 
  Cal didn't want Mom and Dad to know he took off. 
  Oh, my God. 
  He wanted me to find this. 
  Well, they need to know now. 
  We need to send this to your parents. 
  GRACE: I just can't help but think that if we'd been living under the same roof, then Cal wouldn't be missing right now. 
  You're right, but that doesn't mean you should start blaming yourself. 
  Actually, I wasn't, but it kind of sounds like you're blaming me. 
  No, no, no. 
  I'm agreeing with you. 
  I'm blaming us. 
  Do you think that I want to be separated? 
  Grace, you kicked me out. 
  And you went with zero objection because you knew that you had put your need to save every other passenger on that plane ahead of the needs of your family. 
  Grace, everything I've done has been for you and the kids. 
  I get that, Ben, but you went too far. 
  Where are the other 190 passengers sacrificing their families? 
  [CELLPHONES RINGING] 
  Oh, my God. 
  Thank you, Olive. 
  "I left"? 
  It's definitely his writing. 
  So he wasn't taken? 
  Could he have traveled here all by himself? 
  It's possible. 
  When he showed up to Red Hook, he took the subway by himself, and then he transferred to a city bus. 
  It's like a-an instinct. 
  He's following something. 
  You're talking about the callings. 
  He could've gone to the bus station, bought a ticket. 
  Ben. 
  Do you think they're looking for Cal? 
  If they are, it's a good sign. 
  Means they don't have him. 
  At least, not yet. 
  The Catskills, really? 
  The boy was seen at the Port Authority Bus Terminal. 
  - He boarded a Greyhound for - For Tannersville, New York? 
  We're looking for him there. 
  Well, something's happened. 
  A 10-year-old boy doesn't just leave home in the middle of the night. 
  His parents don't just lie to the police. 
  - Have we heard from Autumn Cox? 
  - Not yet, but she's been released by the NYPD, per your order. 
  She's a smart woman. 
  She'll call. 
  Keep looking for the parents, but our focus is the boy. 
  Whatever it takes. 
  WOMAN: Director, we've located the boy. 
  GRACE: I mean, it looks rustic. 
  There's a stone fireplace, a lantern. 
  So, we're looking for a cabin in the woods. 
  We need the drawing that was torn out of the book, the exterior. 
  Grace behind us. 
  Are they following us? 
  - Hang on. 
  - [CAR BEEPS] 
  [TIRES SCREECH] 
  How are we supposed to find Cal? 
  We're just gonna lead them right to him. 
  [SHIVERS] 
  [SHIVERS] 
  [WIND HOWLING] 
  [SHIVERS] 
  [HOWLING CONTINUES] 
  [DIALING] 
  [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  [RINGING] 
  About time. 
  Where are you? 
  I know where Cal Stone is. 
  Grace. 
  GRACE: They're leaving. 
  Where are they going? 
  Maybe they found him. 
  [TIRES SCREECH] 
  [GUNS COCKING] 
  - No one. 
  - He's not here. 
  MICHAELA: Thanks for throwing them off the scent. 
  You did the right thing, Autumn. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I hope so. 
  Autumn, you need to be careful. 
  She could easily be sending someone after you. 
  So I I guess I should get going. 
  Your daughter. 
  The name and address of your daughter's adoptive family. 
  I know what it's like to come back and feel like you've lost everything, but bottoming out, it's a good thing. 
  The only place you can go now is up. 
  Autumn, do you have something for me? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Cal drew my daughter. 
  That's why I ripped it out. 
  I told no one, but somehow Cal knew my daughter existed. 
  He even drew her crazy red hair. 
  I'm so sorry for everything. 
  Good luck. 
  That's it. 
  That's the key to finding Cal. 
  [CELLPHONES RINGING] 
  That's Mick. 
  Hey, Mick. 
  Hey, did you get the photo? 
  GRACE: Oh, thank God. 
 
 
 
  Yeah, we're looking at it right now. 
  I mean, it's a cabin in the woods. 
  There's no mailbox, no street number. 
  There's got to be something. 
  Okay, focus on the details. 
  The trees maybe they're visible from the road. 
  Wait, what's that in the distance behind the cabin? 
  On the top of the hill? 
  Yeah, it's a structure of some kind. 
  - I think it's a radio tower. 
  - Radio tower. 
  Ben, I think we saw one. 
  Yeah, we passed it earlier. 
  Hey, you guys, I'm coming up there. 
  Wait for me, all right? 
  If you find the cabin, do not go in there. 
  Wait for me, all right? 
  Just because we threw them off the trail doesn't mean they won't find him. 
  We'll call if we can. 
  Hey, I need you to stay at the precinct. 
  What? 
  Why? 
  Because I might need you to research something or coordinate. 
  - I just - And I think I should be with you, Mick. 
  You're looking for a missing kid. 
  The more cops, the better. 
  And like you said, it could be dangerous. 
  [WIND HOWLING] 
  You okay? 
  Hey, Mick. 
  Yeah, I'm fine. 
  Was that a calling? 
  I'm not sure. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Jared, I need to go up there on my own. 
  You've been so helpful, and I am so grateful. 
  Trust me. 
  I can't explain why. 
  I just do. 
  I know. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I need you to stay. 
  [BRAKES SQUEAL] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm pretty sure it was around here. 
  So which way, right or left? 
  I don't know. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - It's okay. 
  I want to say left, but if I'm wrong, then we're gonna waste time driving through these hills. 
  Well, let's look at the drawing again. 
  Maybe What? 
  What is it? 
  Right or left? 
  "I left. 
  " What? 
  It's not an "I. 
  " I-I-It's a map. 
  Look. 
  Look, look. 
  Look at this. 
  That's the corner behind us, and now we're facing this junction. 
  "Left" means "turn left. 
  " Cal's telling us how to find him. 
  [WIND HOWLING] 
  [BRAKES SQUEAL] 
  [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] 
  GRACE: Oh, my God. 
  Ben, this is it. 
  BEN: Looks deserted. 
  Stump, truck, and there's the radio tower. 
  We're not waiting for Michaela. 
  No kidding. 
  Let's go. 
  Cal? 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  Cal. 
  He's here. 
  Cal! 
  - Cal. 
  - [DOOR CREAKS] 
  Cal. 
  Cal, oh, my God. 
  Oh, we were so worried. 
  Are you okay? 
  - You're alone? 
  - Yeah. 
  Is there anyone else here? 
  Okay. 
  Sweetie, how how did you get here? 
  I took a bus to Tannersville, got a ride with Max from the gas station, then I walked up from the road. 
  I don't understand. 
  Why? 
  Why did you do this? 
  This is where I'm supposed to be. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  Cal, sweetie, we're gonna take you home now, okay? 
  - We're gonna go home. 
  - I can't leave, he's coming. 
  - Cal. 
  - He's almost here. 
  Who is? 
  Who's almost here? 
  What are you talking about? 
  Did you get a calling, buddy, that told you to come here? 
  - Okay. 
  - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] 
  Ben. 
  - To the back room. 
  - Dad! 
  No, Dad, wait! 
  [POUNDING ON DOOR] 
  It's him! 
  It's him! 
  Don't hurt him! 
  [PANTING] 
  Stay there. 
  He's freezing cold. 
  We got to get these wet clothes off and get a fire going. 
  Cal, see if you can find a blanket or something. 
  We got to keep him warm. 
  I have a sleeping bag in my backpack. 
  You brought all this from home? 
  There's bandages, too. 
  You somehow knew he would need all of this? 
  - I knew I had to help. 
  - Well, you did. 
  You saved his life. 
  Any idea who he is? 
  Oh, honey, look at you. 
  You're half-asleep already. 
  Come on. 
  Come lay down, sweetie. 
  [SHIVERING] 
  [SIGHS] 
  All right, hang in there. 
  [SHIVERING CONTINUES] 
  We had the parents, but we lost them. 
  Our asset gave us false information. 
  THE MAJOR: Autumn? 
  Did she? 
  I'm surprised. 
  We'll track her down. 
  Leave her be. 
  We'll find her when we need her. 
  And we don't know why the boy went upstate? 
  No, ma'am. 
  We can widen the search. 
  We assume the parents found him. 
  They'll come back home before long. 
  If I've learned anything running point for 22 years, there's no need to chase the enigma when it lives right in our backyard. 
  We bide our time. 
  Yes, Major. 
  [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - I do like the view. 
  It's spectacular. 
  Anything that's happening in this city, you'll know about it. 
  So, are you relocating, then, to New York? 
  It looks like I'll be spending some time here, yes. 
  [FIRE CRACKLING] 
  Hey, I talked to Olive. 
  She sends Cal her love and a punch on the arm. 
  I don't even know where to start. 
  Like, who is this guy? 
  O-Okay, sure. 
  Let's start there. 
  Your guess is as good as mine. 
  He wasn't on the plane? 
  No. 
  Well, how can you be certain? 
  There were over 190 passengers. 
  Because I know the name and face of every single one of them. 
  He's not on the manifest. 
  [SIGHS] 
  He's somehow connected. 
  Otherwise, Cal wouldn't have made those drawings or come all the way up here. 
  Connected how? 
  You have no idea? 
  Zero. 
  I don't know what he wants, if we can trust him. 
  [SIGHS] 
  The callings are incredibly, frustratingly vague. 
  You know, the best we can do is guess what they mean, what they want us to do. 
  That's not exactly reassuring. 
  Yeah, believe me. 
  Okay, so what now? 
  We watch, listen, because whatever the reason Cal came up here, whoever this guy is It's important. 
  The question is, are we supposed to help him or stop him? 
  I know. 
  I'm sorry. 
  This is what it's been like. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You were trying to take care of us, all of us, all this time. 
  I didn't see it. 
  I didn't let you see it. 
  I just wish you'd told me, Ben, everything from the beginning. 
  It should never have even been a question. 
  Even if it put you at risk? 
  Even then. 
  From now on everything. 
  Everything. 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [DOOR CREAKS] 
  MICHAELA: Where's Cal? 
  BEN: He's sleeping. 
  Finally. 
  I, uh, took the scenic route after I saw government SUVs heading back to the city. 
  Guess the Major called off the dogs. 
  GRACE: He's out of it. 
  He collapsed as soon as he arrived. 
  And no I. 
  D. 
  We don't know who he is or why Cal came to meet him. 
  [WIND HOWLING] 
  Is this what he was wearing? 
  Yeah. 
  - The visions that I've been having. 
  - The blizzard? 
  It's the same jacket. 
  Ben, it's it's him. 
  You think we're okay here? 
  I mean, how long before we're back in the Major's sights? 
  I think we've got some time. 
  The Major has to regroup, but we should keep watch. 
  Ben, we're taking a risk. 
  We should get him checked. 
  No, I am not rushing him off to some hospital. 
  The calling, or whatever the hell it is, has gone to some pretty extreme lengths to put us back in a room with him. 
  I want to know why. 
  Why is he in your visions? 
  - Why is my son coming all this way? 
  - Okay, calm down. 
  I'm texting with Saanvi. 
  He's hypothermic. 
  We're treating it. 
  He's gonna pull through. 
  If he becomes agitated or unresponsive, we're to call 911. 
  [SIGHS] 
  So, Cal? 
  [SIGHS] 
  It's just like when he appeared at the warehouse. 
  He couldn't tell us anything. 
  He just somehow knew to come here and apparently bring all the necessary supplies. 
  The Major knows about Cal, about his abilities. 
  Autumn told her. 
  You. 
  You're her. 
  Michaela? 
  I was hiking, and there was there was a blizzard. 
  I fell in some sort of, like, a like, some kind of cave. 
  I didn't have much. 
  I was burning literally everything I had trying to stay warm. 
  And I had this magazine. 
  And on the final page, it was like you were giving me your strength, willing me to live. 
  [MUG THUDS SOFTLY] 
  How is it possible you're here? 
  Uh what's your name? 
  Zeke. 
  Okay, Zeke, so you waited it out, the blizzard? 
  I got snowed in, packed. 
  I couldn't feel my hands or my feet, but I just I just kept picturing your face. 
  And, I mean, it doesn't make sense. 
  You were You were dead. 
  But I just kept repeating over and over, - right out loud - "Find her. 
  " How did you? 
  I had a vision of you. 
  I heard you. 
  I-I saw you. 
  I don't understand what's happening. 
  You were on that plane. 
  You died. 
  How can you be here? 
  We came back. 
  It was all over the news. 
  You would've had to Zeke, how long have you been out here? 
  About two weeks. 
  I left at the beginning of December. 
  - What year? 
  - What? 
  What year did you leave? 
  What d This year. 
  Can I see that? 
  Zeke, what year? 
  Guys, what the hell? 
  Zeke, it's 2018. 
  You went on your hike one year ago. 
  That's impossible. 
  It's been two weeks.
