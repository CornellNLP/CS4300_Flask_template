 Previously on "Manifest" I will go to the press about everything. 
  - Our expenses just doubled. 
  - I know, and I've got to get a job. 
  I'm on it. 
  Dad, what are you doing? 
  I'm Danny. 
  Thanks, I can take it from here. 
  Never mind. 
  I got this. 
  Evie, no you don't. 
  Can you hear me? 
  Our son is sick. 
  He doesn't need you to be scientist right now. 
  He needs you to be his father. 
  Unified Dynamic Systems. 
  Everything that I am coming across points back to U. D. S. 
  They are the ones who made the passengers disappear. 
  And I know this sounds impossible, but Cal's fever, I think it has something to do with what happened on the plane. 
  Really? 
  What else could go wrong on this flight? 
  This flight is not happening to you. 
  It's happening for you. 
  If it was happening for me, it wouldn't have bumped me from my original flight. 
  Yet here you are. 
  Now we're all in this together. 
  Hey, bud, how you feeling? 
  I'm scared. 
  I still feel him. 
  Marko? 
  I think something bad is gonna happen. 
  To him and me. 
  Hey, I've got this. 
  Okay? 
  I've got a plan. 
  That's my boy. 
  I want to go home. 
  Hey! 
  So, you are under doctor orders to chill out all day. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay, and remember, if you feel bad, your mom and dad can call me any time. 
  Come on. 
  Let's get you a treat before we get out of here. 
  I'll meet you down. 
  I wouldn't discharge him if he wasn't better. 
  Better enough to go home, but he's not out of the woods. 
  He's still feeling Marko, which means whatever happens to Marko will happen to Cal. 
  Seems like the testing stopped. 
  For now. 
  The passengers were moved. 
  There's satellite footage of the farm being torn down. 
  But I know how to find them. 
  How do we do that? 
  Follow the money. 
  The farm was owned by Unified Dynamic Systems. 
  It turns out their accounting firm is hiring, so I applied for an entry-level job. 
  Entry level? 
  Ben, you're way over-qualified. 
  They're never gonna hire you. 
  Mr. Stone, you seem much too qualified to be applying for Junior Revenue Accountant. 
  JP Williamson provides support for 35 Fortune 500 companies, correct? 
  That's correct. 
  We work closely with the likes of Boeing, AIG, Unified Dynamic Systems If I could get in their books, I should be able to follow the money trail from the farm to wherever they're holding the missing passengers now. 
  And what better way to service them by having someone who is overqualified and starving to get back to work on your team? 
  It might work if they hire you. 
  It has to work. 
  Cal thinks he's in danger. 
  And he hasn't been wrong yet. 
  And it will cost you less than hiring a guy who doesn't have a 5 1/2-year gap on his rÃ©sumÃ©. 
  Welcome to JP Williamson, Mr. 
  Stone. 
  Thank you, thank you. 
  I think this job is gonna be great for all of us, Ben. 
  Look, I know it's not the ideal salary, but there's room to grow, right? 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  And JP Williamson handles the books for practically half of corporate America. 
  They have about 100,000 employees. 
  And now my husband is one of them. 
  Yeah, that'd be cool. 
  Let me ask. 
  Can I go rock climbing today? 
  Hmm, sounds awesome. 
  Wish I could go. 
  Cool. 
  Thanks. 
  She seem off to you? 
  Okay. 
  Full disclosure She is going rock climbing with Danny. 
  - Oh. 
  - He asked me if it would be okay. 
  I was gonna talk to you about it. 
  It's something that they started when she was getting off her anti-depressants. 
  It gave her a goal. 
  They were training weekly to hit a climb in Acadia National Park, but listen, if you are at all uncomfortable with it No, I think it's good. 
  First day, can't be late. 
  Early shift? 
  No, I got to swing by Evie's. 
  Glen called. 
  Beverly's not doing good. 
  Oh, sorry to hear that. 
  Give her my best. 
  Can we talk about your plan? 
  What if somebody connected to the farm - finds out that you're snooping? 
  - How would they? 
  It's the same as if I wanted to snoop on a dirty cop by joining the company the N. Y. P. D. outsources its payroll to. 
  Dirty Harry wouldn't have a clue. 
  Okay, but you're a passenger. 
  What if word gets out? 
  They knew that when they hired me. 
  If they were suspicious, I wouldn't have gotten the job. 
  - Still, I'd keep a low profile. 
  - Of course. 
  I'm just gonna blend in. 
  Flight 828 in the house! 
  Benjamin Stone! 
  What's going on, bro? 
  Ronnie Wilcox? 
  That's me, man! 
  God, I can't believe I'm supervising the Ben Stone! 
  Uh, this is for you. 
  Can't get anywhere in this place without the company dog tags. 
  Yeah, come on, man. 
  Let me give you the lay of the land and, uh, maybe you can tell me what it was like when you first met the aliens, huh? 
  They were nice. 
  Smelled great. 
  Ha. 
  Classic. 
  So, uh, what clients will I be involved with? 
  Small bites, B. 
  Stone. 
  Tier 4 companies the less-than-$15 million-annually crew. 
  Just a heads up my PhD in Applied Mathematics could be of use for some of the big guns like Boeing, U. D. S. 
  Tier-one companies are handled by supervisors only red security and all. 
  It's a grind. 
  We kiss their butts, spend half our time off-site at their home offices Well, I'd love to tag along sometime, or if you need extra pair of eyes while you work Slow your roll, B. 
  Stone. 
  Come on. 
  You just landed. 
  Literally. 
  Huh, this is you. 
  Little welcoming gift for you. 
  Welcome. 
  Oh, and, um, I run a little poker game, middle limit, you know, mostly our department, some logistics guys, I. T. 
  You know. 
  Take over the conference room, sling a little company dirt. 
  If you want, no pressure, brah. 
  I'll check with my wife. 
  - Brah. 
  - All right. 
  Thanks for coming. 
  Beverly could use a friendly face. 
  How is she? 
  See for yourself. 
  Hi, Beverly. 
  Where's Evie? 
  Sure is taking her a long time to come home. 
  I am sure wherever she is now, she's okay. 
  Will you sit with me while I wait? 
  Yeah, of course I will. 
  - Hey, you find something? 
  - Not at first. 
  My access was limited, so I had to improvise. 
  Funny how my ID just stopped working. 
  It gave me an excuse to borrow one with greater access. 
  - Having trouble there, my man? 
  - Card Luckily, my boss is an 828 fanboy, so he was happy to help. 
  - Borrow yours? 
  - Sure. 
  That got me into the system. 
  And what did you find? 
  Something called S. P. 
  I couldn't get access. 
  But here's what I did get. 
  You've been hearing about Fiona Clarke, right? 
  The big-shot professor from the plane? 
  Yeah, Her face shows up in half the 828 news coverage. 
  - Why? 
  - Because she's working for whoever took the missing passengers. 
  Fiona Clarke started her career in neural psychology, ended up being blackballed in her field for her fringe beliefs, so she shifted to spiritual circles and blew up. 
  Huge online presence, books, lectures. 
  And that was before we all disappeared. 
  Fringe beliefs? 
  Like what? 
  Like believing all of our brains can sync up to one another. 
  Like Cal and Marko Valeriev. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  It's all neural connectivity, pathways. 
  A computer alone at your home is powerful, but one connected to a network is all-powerful. 
  The same could be said of our brains. 
  Networked brains. 
  All her files were marked S. P. 
  I don't know what that means, but it has to connect to the detainees. 
  I mean, maybe she sold us out, had the passengers abducted. 
  Maybe she's the mastermind behind what they're doing to the detainees altogether. 
  Hell, maybe she's responsible for what happened to the plane. 
  Well, you can ask her yourself. 
  Tonight. 
  No, not the red door! 
  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE[ Killing it. 
  Hey, did you crush that soccer tournament like you're crushing this climb? 
  Had to bail. 
  It was like two days after the plane came back. 
  - Oh. 
  - I have another one in a week. 
  Nice. 
  Wish I could see it. 
  Oh, damn it. 
  It's all right. 
  Next time, make sure that your knee is bent before you reach. 
  I don't want to do this anymore. 
  Well, where'd that come from? 
  This morning, you seemed pumped to climb. 
  Yeah, and now I'm not. 
  Olive, talk to me. 
  No. 
  I'm out. 
  Well, I'm not. 
  I'll be here tomorrow. 
  Why is Ben Stone working a low-level accounting job at JP Williamson? 
  Maybe they need the money. 
  I think we've wasted enough time on his paranoid theories. 
  Yeah, might not be paranoid. 
  Every single law enforcement and intelligence agency we've reached out to has zero information on those missing passengers. 
  Exactly. 
  I think there's an off-the-books, covert unit running the whole thing. 
  We just don't know who it is. 
  That's what Stone is trying to find out. 
  And I'd bet my house he thinks he'll find the answer at that accounting firm. 
  Shouldn't we trust our fellow agencies and not some civilian? 
  This civilian just might be on to something. 
  Hey, you free to come over for dinner tonight? 
  Here you go. 
  Lourdes would really like to have you over. 
  Might be good for you to spend some time around some friends for a change. 
  Not sure that's a good idea with everything going on. 
  You being led by the voices in your head to blow me off? 
  No, that's just me. 
  Are you still hearing them? 
  The voices? 
  I don't know, but look, if you're worried about me messing up again, it's not gonna happen, okay? 
  At least not in a way that affects you. 
  It's you that I'm worried about, Mick. 
  The N. S. A. is watching you. 
  How do you know that? 
  'Cause they've been all over me, making sure I keep an eye on you. 
  I haven't told them anything, and I never will. 
  Thank you. 
  All units be advised, 10-10. 
  Shots fired at Enrique's barbershop. 
  Corner of Brooke and 20th. 
  - That's right around the corner. 
  - Yeah. 
  Detective Unit Three in proximity and responding. 
  Yo! 
  Yo! 
  Some tweaker just shot my uncle! 
  He ran off up the block! 
  What'd he look like? 
  He's got a red hoodie! 
  He was twitching like crazy! 
  - I'll call a bus. 
  - Where's your uncle? 
  Oh, man, TÃ­o Enrique! 
  Go get some clean towels now. 
  - Do you have a pulse?! 
  - Not yet. 
  Put pressure on the wound. 
  I told him to give the junkie the money he wanted, but he wouldn't. 
  What's happening?! 
  What's happening? 
  I-I don't know. 
  I'm hearing a heartbeat, but I'm not feeling a pulse. 
  Enrique! 
  Come on. 
  Come on. 
  Save him. 
  Save him. 
  No! 
  No, TÃ­o Enrique! 
  No, no This was the last hot chocolate in the break room. 
  I'm gonna deny I gave that to you, okay? 
  Look, I don't understand why he had to die. 
  I'm sorry, Carlos. 
  You guys were close? 
  See, my uncle took me in after my mother died. 
  I was a sick little kid. 
  I needed major surgery. 
  I almost didn't make it. 
  He helped me get better. 
  You see, the money he wouldn't give up, it was to polish up the shop for me to take over soon. 
  He gave me a life. 
  I know what it's like to lose somebody. 
  You're destroyed, like a building imploded. 
  But one day, slowly, you will start to build yourself back up, brick by brick. 
  You finished building? 
  Not even close. 
  It's okay. 
  Take your time. 
  I can't do it. 
  Yes, you can. 
  Carlos, this man is dangerous, a killer. 
  We're still coming up short on the weapon, so he'll do it again if you don't stop him. 
  This is the only way you're gonna get justice for your uncle. 
  People freeze up. 
  - Panic. 
  - Which one was it? 
  Second from the right. 
  No one's processing his release tonight. 
  We'll talk to Carlos in the morning, and hopefully, he'll turn. 
  Yeah, hopefully. 
  - What is it? 
  - I I don't know, there's something about this kid. 
  I need to help him. 
  Have a good night. 
  Did you forget about dinner? 
  I already told Lourdes you're in. 
  Mirror neurons? 
  This is heavy stuff. 
  No one really knows the extent of how these cells operate. 
  [SOFT MUSIC PLAYS[. 
  Your beating heart. 
  My beating heart. 
  We're all one. 
  Honey, we're home. 
  The kitchen is a disaster area. 
  Do not go in there. 
  It smells great. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  All right, well, uh, I'll go change my clothes. 
  Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. 
  I forgot to bring anything. 
  Dude, you're not a guest. 
  You're family. 
  Jared tells me that this invitation was weirding you out. 
  Weird? 
  No, what's weird about this? 
  Still the worst liar ever. 
  We're gonna push through. 
  He dunked it from the free-throw line. 
  I can't believe you're such a die-hard Knicks fan. 
  I'm sorry. 
  What can I say? 
  I'm loyal. 
  Yeah? 
  After 5 1/2 years, the one thing that's still the same is the Knicks suck. 
  Hey, why don't you have a little bit? 
  - I'm good. 
  - I'll have some. 
  I, um, I haven't had a drink since that night, so Michaela, you're not an alcoholic. 
  You're allowed to have a glass of wine. 
  - No one's looking. 
  - I'm looking. 
  Way to be a pillbox. 
  Wait, where do I know that from? 
  That was Evie's - favorite insult. 
  - No, no, no. 
  - Her favorite insult was bitch-monkey. 
  - Bitch-monkey. 
  Oh, Bobby Tufford. 
  Oh, 6th grade, Evie shows up to school in heels, because she's Evie, so Bobby Tufford decides to write "slut" on her locker. 
  - Ouch. 
  - Evie catches him in the act, but when Mrs. 
  Springs asks her who wrote it, Evie doesn't rat Bobby out. 
  She waits until after school, calls him a bitch-monkey, and then beats the crap out of him. 
  She didn't want justice. 
  She wanted revenge. 
  That sounds like she got it. 
  Mm. 
  [HEART BEATING[. 
  What's wrong, Mick? 
  [HEART BEATING[ I have to go. 
  Really? 
  I-I have ice cream. 
  This was really nice, you guys. 
  Thank you so much. 
  Hey, we tried. 
  She wasn't ready. 
  Carlos, open up. 
  What do you want? 
  Same thing that I wanted earlier positive ID on your uncle's killer. 
  I told you I wasn't sure. 
  Yeah, you also said that you don't think you saw a gun. 
  - 'Cause I didn't. 
  - We didn't find a gun, Carlos, because you found it first. 
  You stashed it away, failed to make an ID. 
  Soon enough, that perp's back out on the street, at which point you take him out with his own gun. 
  - You got no proof. 
  - No, I don't. 
  I also don't have a search warrant, but I could get one. 
  And if something happens, I now have a primary suspect. 
  Don't do this. 
  Don't throw your life away for revenge. 
  What life? 
  I'm all alone. 
  I know that feeling, okay? 
  I also know what it's like to take someone's life because I did by accident. 
  It haunts me every single day. 
  I can't even imagine what it would be like to do that on purpose. 
  Imagine if we could empathize not only with those we know but with everyone. 
  Would wars end? 
  Would Would poverty? 
  The potential is boundless and our best hope to fend off the looming threat of A. 
  I. 
  When we learn how to harness the power of collective consciousness with the Mirror Factor Checkmate. 
  Finally. 
  I've been waiting for you. 
  We've certainly generated plenty of notoriety. 
  I imagine we could all go on tour. 
  - Thanks for waiting. 
  - Speaking of, you said that you were waiting for us. 
  What did you mean by that? 
  In the wake of any traumatic event, it's inevitable the participants eventually seek each other out. 
  So, it has nothing to do with you experiencing a calling. 
  I'm sorry, a-a calling? 
  That's our own shorthand for some of the visions and voices some of the passengers have been receiving. 
  - Have they, indeed? 
  - Why don't you just tell us exactly how you're involved with the government secretly detaining 11 passengers from our flight. 
  Forgive my abundance of ignorance, but detained passengers? 
  Detained when? 
  There are 11 people from our flight who still remain unaccounted for. 
  Who we think are being experimented on. 
  It's being tracked in a classified database with your name all over it. 
  Who are you working for? 
  And what does the Mirror Factor have to do with it all? 
  Well, uh Four days after we returned, I was approached by a non-profit interested in funding my mind-body research. 
  They put me on retainer, underwrote tonight's lecture. 
  No one mentioned a word about government affiliation, let alone d-detained passengers. 
  What's the non-profit called? 
  The Singularity Project. 
  S. P. 
  It's time to go play some poker. 
  It could be my way into the Singularity Project. 
  That's the river card, and it's down to two. 
  We got Passenger Ben Stone, fresh from his alien abduction and David James, an insignificantly small cog in the I. T. 
  machinery. 
  I'm sorry you got to work with him. 
  Thank you, thank you. 
  Think too long, you think wrong. 
  Ooh. 
  He calls. 
  All right, let's see them. 
  Turn them, same time. 
  Oh! 
  - And Ben takes it! 
  - Come on. 
  Poker's a game of probability. 
  Math helps me. 
  Oh, another accounting guy that thinks I. 
  T. 
  is less rigorous than math. 
  Dude, not at all. 
  In fact, I can't imagine handling all that data coming in. 
 
 
 
  You know, the security, the storage. 
  Some respect, finally. 
  Hey, you should see some of these raw data dumps from these massive companies. 
  It's incomprehensible, but trippy. 
  I'd like to, actually. 
  Hook me up. 
  All right. 
  Hey. 
  How was the climb? 
  I quit. 
  It's too hard. 
  Too hard? 
  Huh. 
  Well, harder than riding down Tait Hill with no hands? 
  You busted your lip three times. 
  You didn't quit until you nailed it. 
  How do you remember stuff like that? 
  I'm your dad. 
  I remember everything. 
  Your mom told me climbing really helped you when things weren't going so good. 
  Well, that's a polite way of putting it. 
  I'm just saying, you're great now, so I'm a big fan of whatever got you here, okay? 
  Okay. 
  Thank you, Dad. 
  Hey, bud. 
  Doing okay? 
  You want me to bring you some breakfast upstairs? 
  I feel him even more now. 
  That man things are getting worse for him. 
  Listen last night I found out a secret, and that secret makes us so close to finding Marko and making him safe. 
  We're so close, Cal. 
  We're so close. 
  You okay? 
  You ran out of dinner pretty fast last night. 
  I had a thought on the case, and I wanted to follow up. 
  So, that thought on our case was? 
  Carlos is planning a revenge kill, and I think he still has the gun. 
  Possible. 
  Let's get a warrant. 
  I went there last night. 
  Please tell me you did not conduct an unwarranted search for that gun. 
  No, I just asked him about it. 
  Oh, you asked him. 
  How'd that go? 
  I think he'll come around. 
  So much for pulling a warrant. 
  You realize if he had that gun, it's long gone by now. 
  You realize that, right? 
  See, this is what I'm talking about. 
  Those voices in your head getting in the way, making you go s I'll be damned. 
  I'm ready. 
  Diaz, we're ready to make the ID. 
  Love to help you with that, but your suspect's been cut loose. 
  Needed the cell. 
  We had nothing on him, guys. 
  Couldn't keep him forever. 
  Hey, you ready to try again? 
  I thought you might've bailed. 
  I said I'd be here. 
  I'll never lie to you. 
  I lied to you. 
  I never wanted to climb Acadia or anything. 
  So why did you train so hard? 
  Because I like spending time with you. 
  Back at ya. 
  And it's no big deal. 
  Forget Acadia. 
  No, we're doing it. 
  Excuse me? 
  I'm not a quitter, and I'm pretty good at this. 
  Eh, you're okay. 
  Well, what are we waiting for? 
  - Let's do it. 
  - Okay. 
  Hey! 
  'Sup, Stone? 
  I am gonna need like six of these to offset last night. 
  Nice. 
  Hey, super excited to show you our sequence systems. 
  I'm excited to nerd out on it. 
  I actually took some computer science in college. 
  - Oh! 
  - I'm I'm so I'm so sorry. 
  It's okay. 
  It's, uh, not that hot. 
  Uh, do you have any paper towels? 
  Uh, no, but I have some gym clothes in the car. 
  Dude, I-I'm so sorry. 
  It's okay. 
  I'll be right back. 
  Ugh. 
  Ugh. 
  Want me to send a team? 
  No. 
  Yo, bro! 
  Yo Hey, excuse me. 
  - Thanks for saving my spot. 
  - Yeah. 
  So, uh, what's the deal? 
  Ah, just a rando spot check. 
  All the Fortune 500s do it, Rip Van Winkle. 
  Gap in the line there, Benmeister. 
  You know what? 
  I'm gonna use the head. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Corporate espionage is a felony, Mr. Stone. 
  Where is it? 
  Shoe? 
  No. 
  Thermos. 
  That's clever. 
  Thing is, I'm pretty clever too. 
  - How did you? 
  - I'm a deputy director of the National Security Agency, Ben. 
  It's, you know, kind of what we do. 
  Hand it over. 
  Come on. 
  You don't understand. 
  This data can get me to the detainees, which might be the only way to protect my son. 
  This is not a negotiation. 
  You can either hand over the flash drive, or you can be under arrest. 
  You're a math guy. 
  Not much of a calculus. 
  Vance Vance, you have to find them! 
  Vance! 
  This guy's probably long gone by now. 
  Keep driving. 
  [HEART BEATING[. 
  Go faster! 
  Go faster! 
  Is this what I think it is? 
  - Is it the voices? 
  - It's different this time. 
  I can feel it. 
  [HEART BEATING[. 
  Turn left! 
  Right. 
  Right. 
  What's it saying? 
  It's not saying anything. 
  - It's a heartbeat. 
  - Maybe it's just your heartbeat. 
  No, it's not, it wouldn't it just Wait, it was there, and now it's not. 
  It's not there anymore. 
  It stopped. 
  Stop the car! 
  - Aah! 
  - Give me the money. 
  - No, get off me. 
  - Give me the money! 
  It's all I have! 
  Get off me! 
  Aah! 
  That might've been your best yet. 
  Eh, I just think we need more height. 
  - Oh, do you, hot shot? 
  - Seriously. 
  - Like, a legit simulation. 
  - Mm. 
  Successful mission. 
  Thanks for taking her. 
  Bye. 
  So, was it fun? 
  Yeah. 
  You're a good man to let her stick with this. 
  - She did great. 
  - No doubt. 
  - So, how much longer? 
  - I'm sorry? 
  You're training for a climb. 
  When's the climb? 
  Oh, summer. 
  Gotcha. 
  I'm not gonna get in your way, Ben. 
  Olive's not my kid. 
  But I stepped in when you were gone, and I care about her. 
  When she comes to me, I can't turn her away. 
  Nice to see you, Danny. 
  We got him. 
  He walked because of me. 
  If you hadn't caught him, he might've But we did. 
  And when you ID him, he's gonna go away for good. 
  [HEART BEATING[ I'm assuming you didn't hear that. 
  The subway? 
  [HEART BEATING[ How did you know Evie? 
  You knew Evie? 
  She was my best friend. 
  Told you I almost died. 
  Congestive heart failure I needed a transplant. 
  She was my donor. 
  I'm worried about Evie. 
  She's been gone so long. 
  You don't need to worry. 
  I saw her. 
  I saw Evie. 
  She's okay. 
  She's okay. 
  She's okay. 
  Look at that. 
  Hey, bud. 
  Feeling okay? 
  Did the secret work? 
  Did you find the man? 
  Almost, buddy, but it shouldn't be too much longer. 
  I had a big breakthrough today. 
  Then someone bad got in my way, but I promise I'm not gonna give up. 
  You don't have to worry. 
  He's not a bad guy, Dad. 
  Not anymore. 
  Vance. 
  I've got a team on standby. 
  Anything you've got off Stone, they're ready to jump in. 
  No, I didn't get anything. 
  He was clean. 
  How's Cal? 
  He's okay. 
  You, maybe not so much. 
  I need to understand. 
  The callings, what's happening with Cal. 
  I want to believe there's a a reason, but it requires this leap of faith, and I can't I can't trust what I don't understand. 
  I don't understand it any more than you do. 
  But I take that leap and I follow the calling. 
  And I feel a little better. 
  For the first time since Evie, I feel like I might just be okay. 
  That's why I was drawn to the boy, to Evie's heart. 
  I had to know that the callings were right, that it is all connected. 
  Connected to what? 
  To us, to to each other. 
  That's what all of this is for. 
  It has to be. 
  Great. 
  You got a sign. 
  Where's mine? 
  Ben, when did Cal draw that? 
  The other day. 
  Why? 
  That's Carlos with Evie's heart. 
  I think you just got your sign.
