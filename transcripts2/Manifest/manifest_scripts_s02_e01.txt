 Previously on "Manifest" Terribly sorry, folks. 
  That was not on the radar. 
  You've all been missing, presumed dead, for 5 and a half years. 
  Ben! 
  Olive. 
  I discovered something in Cal's blood. 
  It wasn't there before the plane, and it wasn't produced by the cancer. 
  It's all connected. 
  But aren't you seeing things, hearing things in your head? 
  Set them free. 
  The ability to see and hear what's going to happen? 
  That's an incredibly powerful weapon for the military, for intelligence. 
  NSA, drop your weapon! 
  Robert Vance died as he lived in service of our great country Ben Stone is only a vehicle to get to his son. 
  Until we're sure the boy is our Holy Grail, we sit tight. 
  Beloved, my fellow passengers and I were sent back to heal the world. 
  What is this? 
  Some kind of scam? 
  Ben, this is my my calling. 
  Freaks! 
  If you come anywhere near a member of my family again, then you will know exactly what someone who has already died once is willing to do. 
  I can't leave. 
  He's almost here. 
  It's him! 
  It's him! 
  Don't hurt him! 
  Whatever happened to us on that plane also happened to Zeke in his cave. 
  I'm pregnant. 
  Six weeks, maybe. 
  So, right when the plane came Or just before. 
  I'm Danny. 
  - Grace's - I know. 
  I have an appointment with a therapist. 
  Please, come in. 
  The exact amount of time he was gone is the same exact amount of time he was alive again. 
  Are you saying you have some kind of expiration date? 
  June 2, 2024. 
  It's always been you. 
  I want you out of here before she comes back. 
  Michaela and I, we're meant to be together. 
  Back off! 
  Put the gun down. 
  Peanuts? 
  Ma'am, would you like peanuts? 
  Anything sodium-free. 
  Mom's not wrong Jared's not gonna wait around forever. 
  Great marriage pep-talk. 
  Thank you. 
  Why're you fighting this when all it's gonna do is make you happy? 
  It's all we want for you. 
  That's really sweet of you. 
  You must be drunk. 
  Definitely. 
  Say yes to Jared. 
  Have a wedding, a honeymoon. 
  Turn the page. 
  It's time. 
  Ben, what's going on? 
  How are we back here? 
  Why are we back on Flight 828? 
  No, no, no. 
  It's just a nightmare. 
  It's just a nightmare. 
  The turbulence stops, the turbulence stops. 
  It didn't happen this way, it didn't happen this way! 
  It didn't happen this way! 
  Cal. 
  Cal, what's going on?! 
  Answer me, please! 
  Michaela, Michaela. 
  Michaela. 
  Are you okay? 
  Do you understand? 
  Hold on. 
  Hold on, Michaela. 
  Shots fired. 
  Officer down. 
  - We're getting you help. 
  - Officer down. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Yeah, I have eyes on the suspect right now. 
  I'm so sorry this happened. 
  No, believe me, he will not get away. 
  Hey, am I gonna hurt her if I push on this too hard?! 
  Run. 
  No, don't don't exert any energy. 
  Run. 
  Move. 
  You're not putting enough pressure on the wound. 
  Get Hey. 
  Hey, Mick. 
  It's okay, alright? 
  A bus is coming, I promise. 
  Alright, just stay with me. 
  Please. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  Mick. 
  Zeke! 
  Zeke, you son of a bitch! 
  Vitals. 
  What's her vitals? 
  BP 89/51 and dropping. 
  Possible longitudinal transected artery. 
  She's crashing. 
  We need the O. R. 
  Jared?! 
  - She's in surgery. 
  - What happened? 
  I came into Mick's place. 
  - Zeke had a gun. 
  - What? 
  I tried to take it from him. 
  There was There was a scramble. 
  I mean, if I knew she was there, I would've A shot went off as I pulled the gun away. 
  She went down. 
  - Oh. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Ben, I was there to try to keep her safe. 
  She's got to pull through, Ben. 
  She's got to pull through. 
  The surgery just finished. 
  - They're moving her into a recovery room. 
  - And? 
  They said it went well. 
  The bullet punctured her abdominal artery, and we almost lost her, but it sounds like she could make a full recovery. 
  Thanks for finding out. 
  When can we see her? 
  Let's see if we can sneak you in, okay? 
  Alright. 
  Uh - Go. 
  - Yeah, go. 
  We'll see her when she's stronger. 
  - Alright. 
  - No, I'm sorry. 
  I don't know what's going on, but she said that she didn't want to see you. 
  It took much longer before I saw you, they'd have to admit me, too. 
  I don't think your insurance covers worrying about your sister. 
  Where's Zeke? 
  NYPD's looking for him. 
  Jared told me what happened. 
  They'll find him. 
  I hope they don't. 
  Ben, I was on the plane again. 
  What do you mean? 
  828. 
  I was on the plane with Cal. 
  It was nose-diving. 
  I know that it's not reality, but but in my vision, it was it was crashing. 
  Maybe it was just a neardeath experience, but it just Ben, it felt real. 
  Michaela, you need to know something. 
  I think it's a Calling about us dying. 
  Not necessarily on a plane. 
  Griffin died after the exact amount of time he was gone, and then Cal had a Calling about that date. 
  Mick, June 2, 2024 is exactly 5 and a half years after the date we returned. 
  The same thing that happened to Griffin it's gonna happen to us. 
  - No. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  No, no, it's just it-it was It wasn't a normal Calling. 
  - I know it's a lot to take in. 
  - No, no, no. 
  - It's a lot to take in. 
  - No, listen to me, Ben. 
  It was different. 
  Did anyone else have a Calling about the plane nose-diving? 
  I did. 
  Hey, buddy. 
  Come in. 
  I was on the plane with Auntie Mick. 
  Cal, you were gonna tell me something on the plane. 
  As it was nose-diving, you were gonna say something. 
  Cal, what were you gonna tell me? 
  Save the passengers. 
  Get off my property. 
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
  Randall? 
  I'm not here to hurt you. 
  My name is Ben Stone. 
  I was with you on Flight 828. 
  What do you want? 
  Are you hearing things, Randall? 
  Seeing things? 
  Visions? 
  Voices? 
  Do you get them, too? 
  Can we talk about it? 
  You could've been killed. 
  Ben? 
  Ben? 
  Okay, I'm worried about you. 
  I have no choice. 
  The Calling said "save the passengers". 
  To me, that means tracking them down and finding out who knows something we don't. 
  About the Death Date? 
  Maybe we're the only ones who know. 
  Out of almost 200 people? 
  No, someone has to have some kind of clue, some kind of puzzle piece that can help us try to stop it. 
  Would you eat? 
  I'm worried about you. 
  You're not telling people about the Death Date, are you? 
  No, I can't do that. 
  Not without a solution. 
  Not without knowing more. 
  Let's pause on the Death Date talk, focus on something more positive. 
  You're at 14 weeks. 
  Second trimester. 
  Moving along great. 
  We should tell the kids now. 
  They're gonna lose their minds. 
  Bear with me. 
  New record system. 
  How many previous pregnancies? 
  Um, two. 
  Uh, two kids twins. 
  One pregnancy. 
  Uh, it's two pregnancies. 
  I had a miscarriage last year. 
  Okay. 
  I will see you before you check out. 
  Congratulations, you two. 
  Thank you. 
  I should've told you. 
  But you need to understand, you and Cal were dead. 
  I had a huge hole in my life. 
  And Danny had always wanted kids. 
  Well, if he always wanted kids, maybe we're wrong to not find out if the baby's his. 
  No. 
  Ben this is our time. 
  If in six months, when the baby's born, it turns out to be Danny's, we'll deal with it then. 
  For now I just want it to be us. 
  That's right. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hey. 
  - Yeah, she just won't quit. 
  Will you ease up a bit? 
  The first day out of the hospital should be nothing but bingeing junk food and Netflix. 
  I tried telling her that myself. 
  I don't have a day to waste. 
  Well, if you don't wanna be stuck in the basement, you could go up to my room. 
  I've kind of wanted to move downstairs anyway. 
  That's really sweet, but it's just a few days. 
  It's fine. 
  Although, honey, if you are willing to move downstairs, - that could help us out. 
  - Mm. 
  And why is that? 
  Because your room would make a perfect nursery. 
  I knew it! 
  Mom's pregnant! 
  You owe me 5 bucks. 
  - Hey, take it Take it easy. 
  - Ow! 
  - Take it easy. 
  - Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! 
  Well, and for me. 
  I always wanted a bigger family. 
  I can't say that I feel any better, though Michaela finally out of the hospital is a load off. 
  We're not even related, but I don't know. 
  After everything we've been through, she feels like family. 
  Speaking of which, the only downside is, I will miss seeing the Stones around the hospital. 
  You mean Ben. 
  I'm sorry? 
  I hear how you talk about him. 
  Am I wrong? 
  I hadn't even thought about it. 
  Much. 
  You don't have to beat yourself up about it. 
  You and Ben have been through a traumatic journey together. 
  You have seen Ben at his most vulnerable. 
  That's appealing. 
  It's best for me not to think about him in that way. 
  That's impossible. 
  Because of Grace. 
  Yes, Ellen. 
  They're having a baby. 
  Really? 
  It's been a secret, but can we not talk about this? 
  Of course. 
  Moving on. 
  How's your stress level, 1 to 10? 
  It's a 6. 
  7 maybe. 
  Professional stresses adding to that? 
  Two months together, and you've barely talked about work. 
  There's not much to talk about. 
  Work is good. 
  Good. 
  You, uh, redecorated. 
  Two months of tracking down passengers. 
  It's not easy. 
  A bunch have packed up and moved away because of the Xers. 
  Are they really that threatening? 
  Eh, feels that way. 
  Blown up online. 
  Now people are wary of us. 
  Tabloid articles aren't helping. 
  Here. 
  I swung by your place, grabbed some changes of clothes, your mail. 
  Thanks. 
  Yeah, I don't think I'm getting back there for a while. 
  Stay as long as you want. 
  I could use another set of eyes on all this. 
  Ben, I get that you're trying to save the passengers, but we don't even know from what. 
  The Death Date, Michaela. 
  The Calling told us we're all supposed to die. 
  We have until June 2, 2024, to stop that from happening. 
  And what if we can't stop it? 
  So, what, we're not supposed to try? 
  I'm not being dismissive, but if the Callings wanted me dead, I would be dead. 
  It saved my life. 
  What if "save the passengers" is about the here and the now? 
  What if it's about helping them one by one? 
  I'm out there trying to help every day, but if all we're doing is rearranging chairs on the Titanic, what's it matter? 
  Ben, this this is from Zeke. 
  It's his handwriting. 
  He made it to Canada? 
  He's never gonna know about his Death Date. 
  Mick, we've been over this. 
  You're assuming he's You don't assume the same thing? 
  Ben, he's innocent. 
  We have to help him. 
  Alright. 
  So what do we do? 
  How do we find him? 
  We have to make it possible for him to come home. 
  If I could just find a way to clear his name and prove his innocence, then maybe he can show his face again. 
  Detective Stone. 
  You don't start back up until next week. 
  Captain Bowers. 
  Uh, sorry that I wasn't here when you were formally introduced. 
  You weren't supposed to be. 
  You were supposed to be recuperating. 
  So why aren't you recuperating? 
  I'm here to ask you to call off the hunt for Zeke Landon. 
  You're quick to forgive, Detective. 
  It was an accident. 
  That's not how Detective Vasquez described it in the IA report. 
  He was mistaken. 
  You told IA you had no recollection of the moments before you were shot. 
  Maybe you were mistaken? 
  I know Zeke, and he would've never All this, this is why I was brought in. 
  There's been too many loose ends, too much muddy water at this precinct. 
  Bottom line, your new boyfriend and your ex-boyfriend were fighting in your apartment, you got shot, and your new boyfriend ran off. 
  Zeke is not my boyfriend. 
  Whatever he is, you're too close to this, Detective. 
  Go home. 
  Just gonna blow right past me? 
  I don't know what happened that night exactly, Jared, but what I do know is that if you had stopped obsessing over Zeke, if you'd actually listened to me, then I wouldn't have ended up with a bullet in my stomach. 
  That I do know. 
  You don't know. 
  But you convinced yourself so much of it that you block me from visiting you in the hospital? 
  Who does that? 
  I wasn't ready. 
  I might never be. 
  If you'll excuse me, I have some work to do. 
  Save the passengers. 
  And everything started shaking when you saw the Vasiks on the board? 
  This is like the plane Calling I had. 
  Is that what the Calling meant, to save these passengers? 
  This Calling started two months ago. 
  I think it's about helping as many of them as we can. 
  Ben, this is what I'm talking about, about getting out into the world, as opposed to being stuck in here, trying to crack the Death Date. 
  The work in here will help with the work we need to do out there. 
  Now, I tried contacting the Vasiks. 
  Here. 
  I sent them a message six weeks ago, then a follow-up e-mail two weeks ago. 
  Never heard back. 
  Their case file said that they had kids, yet the kids weren't on 828. 
  I spoke to Anson on the plane. 
  Mind if I get some more ice? 
  - Help yourself. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Oh. 
  - Sorry. 
  My bad. 
  - Ooh. 
  - Yeah, tough to cool down since we left. 
  Mm. 
  I've been there. 
  Summer of 2001, I fell asleep on the Staten Island Ferry, and my entire left side nearly melted. 
  Yeah, I'm usually bugging the kids to apply layer after layer. 
  That's how I remember to do the same. 
  And this time they remembered? 
  Left them home, actually. 
  The wife and I took a sort of second honeymoon. 
  Sounds amazing. 
  Wasn't as great as I thought it would be. 
  Uh, missed the kids every single minute. 
  Never leaving 'em again. 
  Mm. 
  Someone was watching their kids. 
  Here. 
  Says here that they left them with a neighbor, Sharice Fields. 
  She raised these kids for 5 and a half years, then their parents came back. 
  I can't imagine that. 
  We have to talk to Sharice. 
  I'll get someone at the precinct to pull up the address. 
  Mick, you're supposed to rest. 
  Maybe Jared and I could No, Jared is the one who got me shot. 
  I'm done involving him. 
  This is you and me. 
  Alright. 
  Thank you for making that reservation. 
  I have missed our tea dates. 
  Well, there's a chance I'm not gonna be your only daughter very soon, so I have to take advantage. 
  Oh, I see. 
  That's Danny. 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi, hi! 
  - Hi. 
  - Hey, Olive. 
  So, uh, how's how's Michaela? 
  She's better. 
  Back on her feet, getting stronger every day. 
  Good. 
  And work and school? 
  Everything? 
  Good. 
  School's pretty boring. 
  Yeah. 
  Not so boring at home, though. 
  Oh. 
  Oh. 
  Uh, Michaela's just staying with us, and, um, my father-in-law has been looking after her, playing nurse, so Well, we should be going. 
  Yeah, um, me too. 
  Um, it's good to see you. 
  Yeah, you too. 
  Why didn't you tell Danny you're pregnant? 
  Is Danny the father? 
  I don't know. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Honey, if the baby turns out to be Danny's, of course we will tell him. 
  You get that, don't you? 
  I just thought this baby would be something special for our family. 
  - And it will be! 
  - Something amazing to bring us all together when everything else is so scary. 
  And, of course, it's not that simple for us. 
  It never can be. 
  - Sharice? 
  - Yes? 
  I'm Detective Stone. 
  This is my brother Ben. 
  We were both on Flight 828. 
  Can we come in? 
  Go play with your sisters. 
  Every time they hear the bell, they think it's their parents. 
  Anson said he would never leave the kids behind. 
  Thank you. 
  Hey, guys. 
  - So, who's in charge here? 
  - Me. 
  What's your name, boss? 
  Sasha. 
  She's not in charge. 
  Mama Sharice is. 
  And who are you? 
  Milo. 
  And this is Tula. 
  She's allergic to peanuts. 
  Oh. 
  Good to know. 
  Thank you. 
  There was no other family, so I was "Mama" all these years. 
  And then their actual mama and papa came back, and I became Mama Sharice. 
  That must be hard for all of you. 
  It has been. 
  Those children are my angels. 
  But Trina and Anson coming home was a miracle, so of course I stepped aside. 
  For the kids' sake, I kept coming around. 
  They don't know their parents from Adam. 
  When was the last time anyone saw Anson or Trina? 
  They put the kids to bed Saturday night. 
  I showed up in the morning. 
  Sunday brunch has been our thing. 
  Pontiac wasn't in the driveway. 
  They were gone. 
  At least the kids were still sound asleep, thank God. 
  Have Trina and Anson had any threats or hostile encounters since they've been back? 
  Haven't all of you? 
  Harassing phone calls, notes on the mailbox Some son of a bitch painted an X on the car. 
  But that isn't the worst of it. 
  What was? 
  They've been hearing things, seeing things. 
  Did they talk about what they heard or saw or write it down? 
  See for yourself. 
  Bible verses. 
  Were they religious? 
  Back in the day, not so much. 
  But since they returned, it's like they were born again. 
  Callings. 
  They were scared to death. 
  And so are these kids. 
  Please help us. 
  Hey. 
  I saw a white van just like that outside another passenger's house. 
  Did you get the plates? 
  I mean, there's a lot of white vans in the world. 
  It could just be a coincidence. 
  Or it could have something to do with the Vasiks' disappearance. 
  Who would have taken them, the Xers? 
  Possibly. 
  Or they could be the Major's new lab rats. 
  I'm here to see Zeke. 
  I'm Cal, Michaela's nephew. 
  Young man, I haven't seen my son in months, and I'm sure Michaela knows that the NYPD has searched my house up and down looking for him. 
  They've had a car parked out here nearly every night. 
  He's here. 
  I know he is. 
  Now, can I please come in? 
  How'd you find me? 
  Dumb question. 
  You need a haircut. 
  Good try. 
  Had a buddy send it. 
  Didn't want her to worry about me. 
  How is she? 
  Still hurts. 
  You're supposed to be together. 
  No, we're not. 
  She almost died, Cal, because of me. 
  - But the Callings - The Callings said you guys are gonna die! 
  You showed me those tombstones, Cal. 
  You were scared to tell your family. 
  The Callings did that. 
  I know when now. 
  I know when it's gonna happen. 
  Cal, I'm so sorry, buddy. 
  Maybe it doesn't mean anything. 
  - Maybe it means something else. 
  - You need to be with Michaela because she doesn't have much time. 
  And neither do you. 
  Alright. 
  Appreciate it. 
  Okay. 
  We'll bring him. 
  Precinct. 
 
 
 
  What are you doing? 
  I have to get into the server to put in a traffic-cam request. 
  You're not back on the job, which is why Bowers sent you packing. 
  You know me. 
  Dog with a bone. 
  What bone? 
  You don't have a case file. 
  Look, if this has something to do with the Callings, I'm telling you right now, this captain came to play. 
  Alright? 
  She will shut you down. 
  - Noted. 
  Thank you. 
  - Michaela, I'm serious. 
  This better be precinct business. 
  It is right there on the board, okay? 
  Anson and Trina Vasik. 
  And that's your business because? 
  Because they were on the plane. 
  I think that they were abducted, Jared. 
  Okay, here's another theory - They picked up and left. 
  - Without their kids? 
  Maybe they're gonna send for them. 
  Anson Vasik cleared his bank account yesterday. 
  $87,000. 
  Does that sound like a kidnapping to you? 
  Could be. 
  Maybe somebody forced the withdrawal. 
  Something is wrong here, Jared. 
  I can feel it. 
  You know that means chances are that I'm right. 
  You need more people on this. 
  We're spread pretty thin, thanks to your friend Zeke. 
  You can drop that. 
  He is long gone. 
  You know that because? 
  I told him to run. 
  I'm gonna pretend you didn't just say that to me. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  What do you got so far? 
  Well the Vasiks clearly had trouble dealing with their Callings, and they were trying to make sense of them through Bible verses. 
  Romans 8:28? 
  "All things come together for good"? 
  Revelation 20:14. 
  "And death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire. 
  - This is the second death". 
  - Whoa. 
  Yeah, I can't tell if they were predicting the Death Date or predicting their death would come sooner. 
  Thanks for coming so fast. 
  Yeah, not a problem. 
  You hear from them? 
  This was in the mailbox. 
  Hey. 
  I was right about the van. 
  Someone's stalking the passengers. 
  Yeah, maybe. 
  But I don't think it connects to the Vasiks. 
  - Why not? 
  - They sent their life savings and what looks a lot like a suicide note to Sharice. 
  "Lake of fire is the second death". 
  - What? 
  - Hey, it's a verse from Revelations. 
  They had it on their wall. 
  What, you think they're gonna act it out? 
  What the hell is a lake of fire? 
  There's a hundred interpretations, but if you're driving around, suicidal, it probably could be any body of water in a fiery car crash. 
  We got to find them. 
  I'm, uh I'm coming to you, okay? 
  Alright. 
  Followed you from the house. 
  I didn't wanna make a scene. 
  I thought you were gone. 
  That's what I wanted you to think. 
  Zeke, you can't be here right now. 
  This is way too dangerous. 
  I needed to see you once more. 
  Once more for what? 
  I kept telling myself that tomorrow I was gonna be a better person. 
  Now I find out there is no tomorrow. 
  Cal got to me. 
  Good. 
  Then you know that you should be as far away from here as possible, living your life, Zeke. 
  You Zeke, you got to go right now. 
  I called it in. 
  What? 
  This is what I need to do with what little time I have left own up to my actions. 
  For once in my life. 
  - No more excuses. 
  No more running. 
  - None of this is on you. 
  Of course it is. 
  I did this to you. 
  - It was an accident! 
  - Exactly. 
  I didn't mean to hurt you, and I did. 
  What happens the next time I get a Calling? 
  Zeke, please, please, please go. 
  Please. 
  God, I wish I wish I met you some other way, you know, in some other time. 
  Who knows what could've been? 
  NYPD. 
  Do not move. 
  - Put your hands on your head. 
  - Wait, wait. 
  No, no, no, no, no. 
  Are you sure it was the GW? 
  How many times did Mom and Dad force picnics on us up here? 
  There they are. 
  Sorry to bother you. 
  Uh, we're having a private conversation. 
  Anson. 
  My name is Ben Stone from 828. 
  We spoke on the plane. 
  What are you doing here? 
  You're close enough! 
  We came to tell you you're not alone. 
  We're all in this together. 
  We're not supposed to be back. 
  We're supposed to die a second death. 
  It's right there in the Scripture. 
  I understand why you believe that. 
  It's more than believing! 
  We hear it! 
  We see it in our heads every day, every night! 
  I've been hearing insane things, too. 
  So has my sister. 
  We've been trying to make sense of all this ourselves. 
  How do we make it stop? 
  Anson, turn off the engine, and we can talk about this. 
  Alright, alright! 
  Get away from us! 
  I'm warning you! 
  Anson, I remember how much you love your family. 
  I love mine just as much. 
  You're not supposed to leave them again. 
  At least not yet. 
  We don't want to. 
  Oh, but the voices, the visions, the headaches, the piercing noise that won't go away, and now being shown that we're supposed to die in the lake of fire. 
  It's too much. 
  We can't take it anymore. 
  The voices, the visions they're not telling you to harm yourself. 
  Then why do we see this cliff?! 
  The car going through this railing?! 
  Hearing the screams of our children! 
  If we have to die, we will die alone. 
  Not our babies! 
  Ben! 
  Thanks for saving us. 
  I'm so glad you're all okay. 
  Let me know if there's anything else we can do. 
  Good luck to you guys. 
  The husband fell asleep at the wheel. 
  The car was hanging on by a thread. 
  It's a good thing we were here. 
  You saved their lives. 
  How? 
  How is this possible? 
  All we know is, when the Callings come, we do the best we can to follow them. 
  But there's so many we didn't follow. 
  Well, my guess is, someone else stepped in for you. 
  There's a lot of us. 
  How are the headaches, the the noises in your head? 
  Gone. 
  I have a feeling it's gonna stay that way. 
  Excuse me. 
  Heard over the radio. 
  You wanna tell me how you, of all cops, happened to find these people? 
  Lucky break. 
  Lucky my ass. 
  I'll expect a full report. 
  Like I said. 
  New sheriff in town. 
  It wasn't just me, okay? 
  - Zeke saved those people. 
  - Of course. 
  - Of course. 
  Zeke. 
  - Zeke and I shared a Calling - that brought me here. 
  - The misunderstood hero. 
  If it hadn't been for that, all six of those people would be dead. 
  Zeke turned himself in, Michaela. 
  He knows he's guilty. 
  What am I missing here? 
  Everything Zeke did, he did for me. 
  So did I. 
  How many other passengers are out there receiving Callings as confused and afraid as the Vasiks? 
  That's why you're out there, talking to as many of them as you can. 
  "Save the passengers", right? 
  Let's hope I can find them all in time. 
  Seeing this couple ready to end it all, it it made me think about letting go of what doesn't matter and embracing what does. 
  So what does matter? 
  That we're a family. 
  All of us. 
  Whatever a DNA test might tell us. 
  We should find out. 
  But nothing changes, Ben. 
  No matter what. 
  Nothing changes. 
  I'm thinking about moving out of my parents' apartment. 
  It's literally the only place I have ever lived. 
  I commuted to college. 
  That week in Jamaica was the only time in my life where I was by myself, and even that wasn't by choice, but now I think it's time. 
  Fresh start makes sense. 
  Thanks. 
  I'm feeling really good about Saanvi, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's my ethical obligation to tell you I think I am wasting your time. 
  What? 
  Why would you say that? 
  You are paying out of pocket for psychiatric treatment, and yet I sense a reluctance to be treated. 
  Ellen, no, I'm a mess. 
  I still have nightmares, constant anxiety. 
  Of course I want the treatment. 
  And yet our sessions still remain very much on the surface. 
  I have been doing this a long time. 
  It is clear to me that there is more going on with you than you are sharing. 
  If you're not truly ready to heal yourself, save your money. 
  You know where to find me. 
  Meantime, here are some non-clinical support groups. 
  I wish you well. 
  Truly. 
  What if I'm ready? 
  Something happened to us on that plane. 
  Hey! 
  Who are you?! 
  Huh?! 
  What do you want?! 
  Come on! 
  Open up! 
  Hey! 
  He Hey, bud. 
  Why doesn't he believe? 
  Believe what? 
  That he matters? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe he just hasn't heard it enough in his life. 
  You need him. 
  The two of you have to do it together. 
  Do what, Cal? 
  I'm not sure what. 
  I just know I don't want to do this anymore. 
  I just want to be a kid. 
  I know. 
  Save the passengers. 
  What? 
  Zeke, Zeke! 
  Who are you?! 
  What do you want from me?! 
  You're not the only one who can come back from the dead. 
  It felt like the plane was crashing. 
  We have to save the passengers. 
  Zeke, grab my hand! 
  You know what happened to flight 828. 
  This changes everything. 
  This is the first step in how we survive. 
  I'll freeze death. 
  I'm not giving up Oh my God. 
  Is this what happened to us? 
  Did we crash? 
  Manifest. 
  New, next Monday, on NBC.
