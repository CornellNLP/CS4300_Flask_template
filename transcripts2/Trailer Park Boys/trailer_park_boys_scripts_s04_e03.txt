 The Sasquatch. 
 Fact or fiction? 
 Those big hairy monsters, they're real, Trin. 
 No, they're not. 
 Look at that thing. 
 What person ever moved like that in the history of people? 
 f*ck! 
 ...is nocturnal by nature, so logically there would be relatively few sightings. 
 Yet there have been literally hundreds of sightings all across North America for generations now. 
 Can all these people be wrong? 
 Trevor, stop f*cking calling me. I got no dope. 
 Hey, Bubs. You watching this documentary of Saskatchewans It's Samquanch, Ricky, and there's one outside my f*cking door right now. 
 He's trying to get into my shed. 
 Holy sh1t, Bubbles, I see him. Don't scare him. It's worth a lot of money. 
 Got the cock-sucker, Bubbles Get him, Daddy! 
 Jesus, he took my bat. He took my- Ah! 
 Crank him, Ricky! Ah! 
 See how big his feet are. 
 What the f*ck are you guys doing? 
 Holy f*ck, he can talk, Bubbles! 
 Omigod, Ricky. That's 'cause he is Julian Julian! 
 Holy f*ck, man. Are you okay? 
 What the f*ck were you doing, boys? 
 Sorry, Julian. We thought you were a Sandsquanch. 
 What is going on? 
 Julian just beat the sh1t out of us with a bat. 
 God, you guys got problems ! We're going to my mother's I don't want you to see your father in this light. 
 Have a great time, kids. 
 What's that supposed to mean Good night, Daddy. 
 See ya, sweetie. 
 Lucy, it was an accident. 
 Do I have a mark here, Julian? 
 I feel right tender. 
 I'm going to bed, boys. 
 I'm sore as f*ck. Good night Good night, Ricky. Top bunk, Julian. 
 I think Bullard's coming on. 
 f*ck that dick. 
 Where's Shitrock at? 
 Shitrock? 
 Shitrock? Here, kitty, kitty. 
 Hey, Bubbles, you awake? I need some duct tape, Buddy My knee is f*cked. 
 Hang on, Ricky. 
 Got some cereal, man. It's new. It's f*cking awesome Oh, yeah? Your knee's f*cked, is it? 
 I got some tape somewhere, but... if you tape my arm up I'll look after it. 
 Boys, I can't even straighten my arm up. 
 Look what you did to me, Rick! 
 Oh, look who's despicably thinking about themselves, huh What about me, Julian? Look at my f*cking eye. 
 See that? And I can't even walk. Being selfish, man. 
 Julian. Sorry we beat you up. I really am, but I did think you were a Samsquanch. 
 Why are you calling them Samsquanches? 
 That's what I've called them since I was little. 
 Well, they don't exist. 
 Bullshit, they don't. 
 Alright, this is the deal, boys. 
 We're gonna be doing some work today. 
 No f*cking way. I gotta get drunk, I'm sore as f*ck. 
 No, no, no. Boys, listen to me. Boys, boys You're gonna help me steal some furniture. 
 It's the least you can do. 
 I'm too sore, Julian. 
 Bubbles, go get some tape. We'll tape ourselves up and we'll go steal some furniture for Mr. f*cking Selfish. 
 Holy f*ck, this cereal is good f*ck, Ricky, there's Barb. Cut your piss off. 
 I can't cut my piss off, Bubbles, you know that. 
 'Morning, boys. I hear you beat the sh1t out of each other last night with baseball bats. That was smart. I wonder if you could explain this purchase order I found for a $2,000 Everlast Wrestling Ring. 
 Barb, it's not a wrestling ring, it's more like a multi-purpose community centre. 
 It says wrestling ring on the purchase order, so I cancelled it. And I wonde when you are going to get around to doing those clothesline repairs we talked about? 
 Actually, we're doing that today. 
 I just gotta go pick up some clothesline wire- 
 Ricky! 
 We gotta pick up some poles, we're gonna fix them today I'm sorry about that. Bubbles, I'm sorry. Jesus. 
 Good. That's great. Julian, if you are serious about buying the park, I want a cash deposit. 
 Not bottles, not dope, cash. And I want it today. 
 Otherwise, I'll list it with a real-estate agent. 
 f*ck! 
 Barb, I'll have the money. 
 What are those fuckers up to Probably going for some shitdogs and fries, Mr. Lahey. 
 Randy, I thought we agreed No more sh1t talk till we're back in power. 
 You ready for a little B & E ? 
 Bacon and eggs? 
 Evidence gathering. 
 Just put this on Jim Lahey's account. Sunnyvale. 
 Ricky, I can't do that. 
 I guess you're gonna have to pay for it yourself, then. Cause we're f*cking taking it. 
 f*cking Jacob. 
 Ah. f*ck! 
 Ah, f*cking Jesus! 
 Careful, Ricky. Careful. 
 Holy f*ck, boys. Cyrus number one. 
 It says "Dick" and then the arrow points right to Cyrus. 
 Look at this, Randy. 
 Unopened trailer-park supervisor correspondence. 
 It's a good goddamned thing we're back to take care of sh1t like this. 
 Check this map out, Mr. Lahey. 
 Wonder what it's for? 
 I haven't the foggiest notion. But I got a niggling suspicion whatever it is, is gonna help send Ricky up piss creek for a long time. 
 What are you guys doing here?! 
 Ah, thanks for your concern, ma'am. 
 We thought, uh, we heard someone breaking in What's that? 
 It's some map. 
 I'm gonna tell my father We got Corey and Trevor working on the clothesline The last thing we need is Barb Lahey freaking out on us.t Where we going now, Ricky? 
 We're gonna smoke a join and go steal some furniture from Julian. I know just the place. 
 The people are stupid and they got the best furniture. Government buildings are so easy to rob. You come during the day and take everything. No one even says anything. 
 Wait. We're actually about to start a production meeting. 
 There's new furniture coming in about five minutes So I'm just gonna take this. 
 First, let me call my supervisor, please. 
 I'd love to, but we need that phone. Sorry. 
 Hey, excuse me. Everybody, just put the stuff down, please. 
 Just keep that stuff coming right out here. 
 Where are you guys taking this stuff? 
 Just put it down. 
 You can't have our stuff, okay? Like, we need this. 
 We're trying to work here. 
 Look, I'm trying to do my job. 
 Keep it coming. I need four loaders for the car. 
 Who said you could take this stuff? 
 Paul or Jeff. Head office. 
 Jeff? 
 I don't know. 
 You talked to Jeff? 
 Yeah. Everything's cool. There'll be new sh1t here in about 10 minutes. It's a lot nicer than this shitty stuff Oh, we're getting new stuff. 
 It's brand new, it's great I just talked to Jeff and we're getting new stuff. 
 Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! 
 Randy and Lahey broke in and tried to steal this. 
 Great, Ricky. They got half the dope map. Nice work, buddy It's not a big deal. They got a little piece and we named all the dope fields after cats, anyway. 
 They won't have a f*cking clue ! 
 It could've been a big deal! 
 Lahey's gonna try anything to get us thrown back in jail! 
 Alright, we gotta set up a front to distract those dicks. 
 How much of the dope map did they get, Ricky? 
 Ouch, boys, I feel like I got hit by a f*cking dump truck. 
 How much would a massage thing cost me, do you figure? 
 A massage? 
 Look, Julian, I know I'm dumb as f*ck and stuff but... why couldn't we just steal more furniture and fill up these trailers with furniture and f*cking open, like, a used furniture store or some sh1t A used-furniture store is not a bad idea, Julian. 
 Keep Lahey and Randy distracted, make a few bucks. 
 Exactly. Get two birds stoned at once We're gonna fill the trailers up with furniture alright. 
 But we're gonna rent them out by the hour. 
 Oh, that's greasy. 
 That's really f*cking greasy Yeah, it's greasy. 
 Gre-he-he-eeasy! 
 What's up, Julian, Bubbles, man? 
 You guys look f*cked up. 
 Don't even want to talk about it. Look, J-Roc, I'm looking for some ladies. I know you know what kind of ladies I'm talking about. 
 Talk to my manager, bitch. 
 Manager? 
 Yeah, that's right. I'm representing J-Roc now I'm representing T-Knuckles and finally I'm takingn these guys' careers to a whole new level and new directio and finally putting Sunnyvale Trailer Park on the map. 
 For real. 
 For real. 
 Look, man, I'm opening up a massage parlour, alright I need six ladies. 
 You talking about opening up a rub-a-tiz'zub, mo-fucker I'm feeling that. I'm feeling that. 
 A rub 'n' tug? 
 Yeah. 
 Let me talk to you, then. I'll do you what you want. 
 I'll get you the ladies. I'll get you the hos. 
 It's gonna cost you at least thirty points, homey. 
 What do you think, Bubs? 
 Well, I don't know much about this stuff, Julian. 
 They're good hos, man. I'm telling you. 
 What other choice do we have? He says they're good hos. 
 Alright, alright. Done. Three o'clock. 
 I'll see you then. I'll be here waiting with the hos.

 This type of sh1t is gonna land the pimp in jail too.

 Sarah, calm down.

 I can't stand around and take this bullshit. 
 I'll take all three of you crippled fuckheads on at the same time, or are you scared? 
 Cyrus, we're not scared of you. 
 We're just all too sore to fight you because me and Ricky thought Julian was a Samsquanch monster and we beat each other up with baseball bats. 
 Friggin' Cyrus. 
 Randy takes his pants off now when he wants to fight He can't fight in tight pants. 
 He's worried about ripping his precious little pants. 
 When the pants come off, look the f*ck out. 
 No one here is man enough to knock this chip off my shoulder. 
 Huh?, I am, Cyrus. I'm way more of a man than you'll ever be you dirty bitch. 
 Is that right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, what are you gonna do?
