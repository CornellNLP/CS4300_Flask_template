 Previously on "Mistresses"... 
 [Horn blares] 
 Savi : You only chose me because you thought I might die. 
 I made some mistakes. So did you. 
 Are we done here? 
 Yeah. 
 I like you, Dom. 
 [Cellphone chiming] 
 Who is Daniel, and why's he texting... 
 None of your business. Play with your new phone. 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 Joss : When was the last time you were even on a date? 
 Oh, I'll make you an online profile like I did for April. 
 It'll be fun. 
 I'm sorry. Did I miss the open house? 
 Are you the owner? I'm Zack. 
 Savannah. 
 Hi. Can I help you? 
 Yeah, it's Zack. 
 We met the other day. I came for... the open house. 
 Oh, yeah. Uh, hi. 
 The house isn't on the market anymore. 
 I actually accepted an offer. 
 That's okay. 
 I wasn't really interested in the house. 
 I just wanted to meet you, Savannah. 
 We need to talk. 
 I-I'm sorry. What what is this? 
 I'm Zack Kilmer. 
 From the accident. 
 I was driving the other car. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Sean : Karen? 
 Karen Kim? 
 Sean? 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 Likewise. 
 Uh, if I may say so, wow. 
 You're even prettier in person than your profile picture. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Believe me, that never happens. 
 Yours was pretty accurate, too. 
 I'll take that as a compliment? 
 It's actually my first time doing this. 
 I'm still learning the ropes. 
 I'm kind of a pro, unfortunately. 
 [Laughs] 
 Any tips? 
 Uh, Google. Always Google. 
 Did you... Google me? 
 With most women, you don't find much. But with you... 
 Well, you know, since you've been in the news... 
 Can I ask you one thing? 
 Did your life flash before your eyes? 
 I mean, a gun pointed at you, that's intense. 
 [Sighs] 
 It was. 
 It was your boyfriend's crazy wife? 
 You know, Sean... 
 You'd rather not? 
 No. 
 Right. Understood. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay, just one more thing. 
 So, when the police held you for hours... 
 That must been pretty dramatic. 
 Is this really necessary? 
 You're so boring sometimes. 
 Okay, open them. 
 A box. 
 Whoo! 
 Mm. 
 Dude, you're really killing my vibe. Come on. 
 New business cards! What?! 
 Wow. 
 Right? 
 Where are the real ones? 
 [Sighs] 
 Harry! 
 All right, look. 
 Your food is great and all that jazz. 
 But truly, this... this face, that's what all the ladies want. 
 And... half the gentlemen. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And I ain't so bad myself. So why not use what we got? 
 What did you do to my... 
 Janine : Hello?! 
 Janine, hey. 
 Oh. Hi. 
 How are you, Love? 
 Well, I'm hung over, but I'm fabulous. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Laughs] 
 Please, take a seat. 
 Thank you. 
 No, wearing white. That's not going to work. 
 But I do have something that's gonna make both of you very happy... Your check. 
 Oh! 
 [Laughs] 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, no. Thank you. 
 My friends are still talking about how great that party was. 
 Oh, w-well, hey, if any of those friends want to give us a call, please, word of mouth is huge for us. 
 Oh! Oh, my gosh, these are adorable. 
 Thank you! They're new. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yes. You know what? 
 Why don't you give me a bunch more of these, because I'm going to a charity gala tomorrow and it's called "kick Leukemia in the ball." 
 [Laughs] 
 How cute is that? 
 And it's such a good cause. 
 Hey. Oh, my gosh. Why don't you two come, as well? 
 It would be a fantastic networking opportunity. 
 Oh, are you sure? That's so generous of you. 
 My table's full, but there are smaller ones available at $5,000. 
 Tax deductible, of course. 
 Of course. 
 You just say the word, and I'll get you in. 
 Yeah, no, I don't think we... 
 In. 
 [Squeals] 
 Yay! 
 Fantastic! I'll see you tomorrow. 
 I'll call and let them know. Mwah! 
 Okay. Ta-ta. 
 Ciao, ciao. Bye. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay... 
 Have you gone insane? 
 I know it seems like a lot of money. 
 Yeah, $5,000 is a lot of money, Joss. 
 It's not that much money if we split it... 
 It's $2,500 each. 
 Absolutely not. 
 You heard what she said, it's a huge networking opportunity. 
 If we want to build this business, we have to take some risks. 
 Eating puffer fish is a risk, Joss. 
 This is stupid. 
 Okay, fine, I'll cover the whole thing myself. 
 All of it. All you have to do is show up. 
 Can you handle that much? 
 Joss. 
 It's your entire share of this check which, let's be honest, is basically all the money you have. 
 Okay, well... I guess I'm all-in. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well I... I hope for your sake it pays... 
 It'll pay off. 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ 
 [Both moaning] 
 I missed you. 
 Mm. I missed you, too. 
 How much? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Sighs] 
 That could be Lucy. 
 [Ringing stops] 
 Nope. Just my friend Joss. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know you can answer your phone in front of me, right? 
 [Laughs] 
 I know. 
 But this is our time, and I don't want to waste a minute of it. 
 Lucy will be here soon, and I'll have to kick you out of this cozy... little... cocoon. 
 [Laughs] 
 I like the cocoon. 
 Mm, good. 
 But we are always in it. 
 Mm. 
 I like spending time with you, April, okay? A lot. 
 And... and I don't want to mess this up. 
 Me either. 
 But if there is one thing that I learned in my time as a dark and brooding artist-type... 
 If you spend all your time inside the cocoon,  there's no chance of building anything outside the cocoon. 
 Yeah, will you just stop saying "cocoon"? 
 Come on. Listen to me. 
 What I'm saying is I want to meet Joss. 
 I want to meet all your people. I am serious about you. 
 You are? 
 You're important to me, and I want to meet the people who are important to you. 
 I don't remember that much. 
 Woke up in the hospital with tubes and wires everywhere, everything hurting. 
 Snapped my femur, blew two vertebrae in my back. 
 Got a metal rod in there now. 
 Doctors say I'm lucky I'm not paralyzed. 
 Glad you're okay. 
 Well, if you can call it that. 
 I used to work construction. 
 Turns out you can't do that with a metal rod in your spine. 
 I was in the middle of a job, too. 
 It's too bad I didn't get hurt there, if it had to happen. 
 At least I could have got workman's comp. 
 Have you looked into disability? 
 Yeah, I get it. All 300 bucks a week. 
 There are some exercises you can do for your back to strengthen it. 
 Maybe if you talked to your physical therapist, they cou... 
 My insurance doesn't cover any physical therapist, and I don't need any more bills than I already have, that's for sure. 
 Okay. 
 My girlfriend, she was helping me out for a while. 
 I guess she just had enough. 
 And here you are. 
 Yeah, well, this whole time, all the papers I kept filling out, I kept seeing the same name on them... 
 Savannah Davis. 
 I mean, this thing changed my whole life, you know? 
 And I didn't even know who Savannah Davis was. 
 So you just wanted to meet me? 
 I wanted to know what it was like for you. 
 If it was the same as me. 
 Looks like you're doing all right, though. 
 [Sighs] 
 No, no, no. 
 Look, uh, it has not been easy. 
 Six surgeries, six months in rehab. 
 My family and friends really came through for me. 
 And I know it can be the hardest thing to ask the people that are closest to you for help, but... 
 [Sighs] 
 They can make all the difference in the world. 
 Sometimes they can't. 
 So, do you want money from me? 
 Is... is that what you think? 
 I don't know, really, what to think. 
 You came in here talking about bills and... and... and insurance. 
 Trying to tell you that nobody gets what I'm going through, and you th... 
 You think I'm hitting you up for money. 
 Look, I'm sorry. I just... 
 I-I don't know what you want from me. I... 
 [Sighs] 
 Nothing. 
 I don't know why I came here. I don't... 
 I don't know who I expected you to be. 
 Look, I-I... 
 I'll see myself out. 
 [Door slams] 
 Okay, okay. So, wait. Just... It couldn't have been that bad. 
 He said he was turned on by the fact that I could inspire murderous passion. 
 [Laughing] 
 What? Okay, fine. 
 You got one weirdo. Big whoop. 
 He knew what kind of gun Elizabeth used. 
 He knew Sam broke through the door. 
 He knew what I wore to the trial that day. 
 Oh, the Donna Karan jacket? 
 Loved! 
 Joss! 
 The point is, I can't date. 
 Of course you can. 
 How? Have you googled me recently? 
 What you find isn't pretty. 
 What... What are you talking about? 
 Oh. Okay. I get it, yeah. 
 So, maybe you're just not the ideal candidate for Internet dating. 
 [Sighs] 
 You just do it the old-school way. 
 Go out into the real world and meet somebody. 
 Yeah, you got to put yourself out there. 
 It might be a little extra leg work, but, hey, at least you can charm the pants off of him before he finds out who the Greys are. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Ooh, sorry. 
 What are you saying? I should go clubbing? Hang out in bars? 
 I met Daniel at an art show I didn't want to go to. 
 Exactly. You can't expect a love life to fall into your lap, Karen. 
 You have to really want it. 
 I do want it. I just... 
 Wish it was 20 years ago when your secrets were your secrets, and no one could get to them unless you wanted them to. 
 I just have to face it. 
 Unless I want to bring Elizabeth and Sam and Tom on dates with me, I'm done. 
 Oh. 
 I'm just gonna throw myself into my work. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, change of subject. 
 I know this is bad timing, but Daniel wants to meet my people. 
 What people? Us people? 
 Well, you're the best ones I got. 
 So he's serious about you. 
 [Sighs] 
 So he says. 
 Oh. That's so great, honey. 
 So, dinner tomorrow night? 
 Oh, no, tomorrow night I have a work thing. 
 Oh, I already told him tomorrow. 
 I'm free for the foreseeable future. 
 What about Savi? 
 Well, I called her. She hasn't called me back yet. 
 Is she doing okay? 
 Yeah, she seems okay. 
 But honestly she hasn't said much to me about anything. 
 Me either. 
 Me neither. 
 She'd tell someone if something was wrong. 
 Yeah. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey. You busy? 
 Uh... nope. 
 Good. Um... where's the roomie? 
 She's downtown taking depositions, mercifully. 
 Great. 'Cause, um... I-I wanted to talk to you. 
 Um... 
 I think we should come out as a couple. 
 Yeah, I-I've been thinking about it, you know, and i-it's worse if we get caught. 
 But you were so sure we should keep it quiet. 
 Did something happen? 
 Yeah. 
 No. No. Well... well, yeah. 
 You know, I mean, at at the very beginning, I thought it would be simpler, you know... 
 You just coming back, us finding our groove. 
 I-I didn't want to put any more stress on us. 
 But, you know, I think we're past all that. 
 Why not own it and just move on clean? 
 Right. I mean, why not? 
 Okay. All right. 
 So, um... so we'll go to H.R. today? 
 Absolutely. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. In we go. 
 [Gasps] 
 I knew it would fit! 
 I look like "The jerk." 
 What? You don't look like a jerk. 
 "The jerk." St... "The jerk." 
 Steve Martin. The movie. "The jerk." 
 [Laughs] 
 I don't know what that is. 
 Okay, what if... 
 Hello! Oh, my God. 
 Kyra, I... 
 No, just come in. That's good. 
 It was open. You look like "The jerk." 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, funny. Yep. 
 What are you... please tell me you're not wearing that. 
 Please tell me you have a tux. 
 Yeah, I had a tux from my wedding, but I don't think we need any bad luck tonight, do we? 
 Okay, well, suit yourself. 
 Get it? 
 Oh, I did get it. That was good. 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right, um, so, for tonight, at the moment, if you want to invite anyone, please do, because our table's looking a little bit light. 
 Why? What do you mean? How light? 
 Um, like, at the moment, it's you and it's me. 
 And me. 
 And Kyra. 
 What was the point of booking a whole table, Joss? 
 Okay, what about Karen and April? 
 They can come, right, with dates? 
 No, no, they're busy. 
 Did you tell them that you spent $5,000? 
 Surely they can move some things around. 
 You know what, Harry, I don't think that they would have fun, anyway. 
 We're gonna be working and running around and... 
 Can I invite someone? You can invite three someones. 
 Seriously? 
 Mmhmm. 
 I'll go make some calls. 
 Someone's excited. 
 Mm. All right, oh, okay. 
 Karen and April, are they not coming because of me? 
 No, no. 
 No. I mean, not exactly. I-I didn't invite them. 
 Harry, I-I can't invite them and not invite Savi. 
 And obviously, I can't invite Savi, so it's just... 
 You know, it's just easier this way. 
 Right. Sorry about that. 
 Hey, you can't expect to win us all in this thing. 
 Yeah, I know. I know. I know. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm. 
 Hey! 
 You got me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Karen : Is there anywhere you'd like to start? 
 Anything you want to talk about? 
 Not really. 
 How about the thoughts in your head before you went to sleep last night? 
 Who says I slept? 
 There was a rager on the roof of my condo, some persian engagement party or something. 
 Lots of cousins. 
 I'm relieved to hear that. 
 That you weren't up fixated about something. 
 Those thoughts have stopped. 
 Which thoughts are those? 
 The bad ones. 
 The... wanting to kill myself ones. 
 Should we talk about that? What led you there? 
 Sorry, do I have to sit here? 
 No. Make yourself at home. 
 I know it must be painful to remember, but it's important. 
 If we examine what happened, we can try to avoid the same negative thought patterns in the future. 
 Do you remember what you were thinking and feeling in those moments when you wanted to hurt yourself? 
 Um, I was upset, obviously. 
 About something specific? 
 I got in a fight with my parents. 
 A really bad fight. 
 My dad said they didn't want to talk to me anymore. 
 That's pretty extreme. 
 Yeah. I thought so, too. 
 What did you fight about? 
 How I had shamed the family with my career choice. 
 What do you do? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm an escort. 
 Look, it's not like I dreamt it up on career day or anything. 
 But college is really expensive and... my parents couldn't help. 
 Sleeping with rich guys was a fast way to make a lot of money. 
 Lots of girls do it now. You'd be surprised. 
 Plus, it was kind of... interesting. 
 How so? 
 Well... you're out a lot. 
 Dressed up, meeting new guys, trying new things. 
 [Laughs] 
 I guess I'm kind of a free spirit that way. 
 Even though people who know me wouldn't say that. 
 What would they say? 
 That I'm a good girl. 
 It wasn't really me, anyway, who was meeting those men. 
 I gave them a fake name, fake story, whatever turned them on. 
 Would you say you did it to feel like someone else? 
 No, I did it to buy an education and a great condo in Beverly Hills. 
 And as a plus, you know... 
 I never spent a night alone. 
 Come on. 
 Woman : Okay, miss Davis. 
 Uh, yes! Yes, yes. I'm here. 
 Section "P", row "Q". 
 Okay. And... and how much are these? 
 Uh, each? 
 $200 to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers from that far away are you kidding me? 
 Uh, no. Uh, they're for a friend. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, you know what? Let's just do it, all right? 
 Uh, yeah, yeah. C-can you hold on one sec... 
 H... oh, j-just hold on. Give me one second. 
 Molly? Molly! 
 Line one, give her my mastercard. I'm late for my H.R. meeting. 
 Wendy : And that's my Willie as Abraham Lincoln. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The resemblance is... uncanny. 
 So cute. Aw. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. Did I miss it? Are we out? 
 Actually, uh, I haven't told Wendy anything yet, so... 
 Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. 
 Dom : It's all right. It's all right. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Hi. 
 So, uh, as you may have guessed, Savannah and I asked you here because we are in a relationship, uh, a personal relationship. 
 And obviously, we would never let that affect work, but we just thought we should handle it on the up-and-up. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 Let me just turn the ringer down here. 
 [Ringing stops] 
 Okay. 
 Well, I certainly appreciate your initiative. 
 You know, most people wait till there's a problem to come to human resources. 
 Exactly what we were hoping to avoid. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Uh, the ticket place said that your card is expired. 
 Do you want me to use another one? 
 This... this is kind of an important meeting, Molly. 
 Sorry. 
 [Sighs] 
 Tickets? 
 Y-yeah, for, uh, Joss' birthday. 
 Hmm. 
 Anyhoo, let's just get to the employee conduct guidelines... 
 
 
 
 [Jazz music plays] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 Okay, so, if this is table 8 and this is table 25, there's obviously no logic to how this is all arranged. 
 This is so hard! 
 I'm under dressed. 
 Oh, I-I told you you would be. 
 You said you didn't care. 
 Yeah, well, that was before we bloody got here. 
 Well, this is why you should listen to me about everything, Harry, all the time. 
 [Gasps] 
 Found it! Yay! 
 Scott, you're here. 
 How are you? Good to see you. 
 Guys, this is my amazing friend Scott. 
 He did my nose. 
 Oh. 
 I don't... I don't normally lead with that, but, uh, I'm Scott. 
 I'm a plastic surgeon. 
 H-hey. 
 Kyra : Amazing plastic surgeon. 
 I used to have this huge bump right here, and now it's totally gone. 
 He also does boobs. 
 Well... 
 Okay, this is not going, um... 
 Like I thought it would. 
 Well, it's nice to meet you, Scott. 
 Hey. My, uh, boobs are fine, so I'm gonna find the bar. 
 All right. 
 I'll come. 
 [Laughs] 
 Full of energy, that one. You want to have a seat? 
 Oh, no, I'm okay, thanks. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. All right. 
 Oh, the, uh... 
 It's a pretzel roll. 
 Uh... I'm... no, I'm good. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 No, it's pretty much the greatest pretzel roll I've ever had in my entire life. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 You're gonna love it. 
 Okay. 
 You're not gonna eat it? 
 [Laughing] 
 What? 
 Well, I mean, I just said this is pretty much the greatest pretzel roll I've ever had in my entire life, you know, and then, I think, you know, by offering it to you instead of taking it for myself is sort of a romantic gesture, you know? 
 [Sighs] 
 Of course, now I feel vulnerable admitting that to you. 
 [Laughs] 
 Feel like if you don't eat it, it would be a real gut punch. 
 You do realize that there are a lot more rolls? 
 Yeah, no, I, um... I was just joking. 
 I'm never vulnerable. 
 Also a joke. 
 Are you on something right now? 
 I am, uh, rusty with the small talk, is what's going on. 
 I don't go on a lot of blind dates. 
 Oh... 
 Yeah. 
 Mm... hmm. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, you know what, um... 
 I'm just gonna grab a cocktail really quickly. 
 Excuse me, sir. Sorry. 
 I'm just gonna take one. 
 Okay. 
 [Sighing] 
 They're late. 
 I'm sure they'll be here soon. 
 [Sighs] 
 Savi : Hi! 
 Hey. 
 I am so sorry. 
 And Dom will be here any minute. He got stuck at a meeting. 
 Where's Daniel? What happened? 
 Are we not meeting Daniel? 
 It's a whole thing. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Daniel will be here in 10 minutes, okay? 
 I called you here early so we can go over some guidelines. 
 Guidelines? 
 Yes. And quickly, since we're running out of time. 
 Sorry. 
 So, topics to avoid. Paul, for example. 
 Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that, because I was actually gonna lead with Paul. 
 No, no, no. 
 No stories about high school Paul is in most of those... 
 And no wedding stories, Karen. 
 Why in the world would I tell your wedding story to your new boyfriend? 
 [Scoffs] 
 You told them to Richard! 
 I did? 
 You did. 
 Um, okay, wait... so, when we say no Paul, are we talking about, like, no Paul of the last three years, or no Paul from, like, ever? 
 No, no, no. Neither. None of it. No. 
 Because no matter what part of the story you tell, the story ends the same. 
 And in that story, I'm betrayed and duped and naive, and I don't want him to see me like that. 
 I really like this guy. I like who I am with him. 
 I am cool and free and just in the now. 
 I mean, you've never seen me so in the now. 
 Got it. 
 No Paul. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is gonna be great. 
 It'll be great. 
 Have a lovely night. 
 You got any jobs lined up for us yet? 
 I'm working on it. You could smile a little bit. 
 Where's Scott? Who? 
 Oh! 
 The stranger who thinks he's on a date with me. 
 How's it going? 
 Yeah. 
 Did you tell him that we were on a date together? 
 Yes. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I just figured that you're a great person and he's a great person and two great people should meet each other. 
 You do understand that this isn't how setups work, right? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, if you're gonna set people up, you don't just tell one of them. 
 You tell neither of them or both of them. 
 You don't just tell one. 
 Oh. That does make more sense. 
 Yeah. Did you know about this? 
 Absolutely not. 
 What do you think of him, though? Scott. 
 Kyra, just... shh. I think I'm here to work. 
 I think I spent $5,000 on a table and I really need to get my money back, and I think I don't have time to babysit your little friend. 
 And even if I did, I don't want to date a fricking plastic surgeon, okay? 
 Three words. 
 Hmm? 
 Free Botox. 
 Two words. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Daniel : It's so good to meet you guys. 
 I've heard great things from April. 
 Savi : Oh? 
 Yeah, she's told me nothing. 
 [Laughter] 
 Uh, where are you from? 
 Actually I grew up with my family and my sister. 
 That's Joss, you'll meet her. 
 Okay. And how did you two meet? 
 Oh, we... 
 At work. 
 Uh... the office. 
 Right on. 
 Okay, uh... and Karen, how do you fit into all this? 
 Well, I met, um... April through S-Savi, and, um, Savi and I, we met in grad school. 
 You're a lawyer? 
 Psychiatrist. 
 What an interesting job. 
 I mean, you must see some really deep stuff, right? 
 Like, human frailty... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yep. 
 I almost forgot. 
 We have some news. 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
 [Laughs] 
 We came out to H.R. today. 
 You did?! 
 Daniel : Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, that's great. 
 That is... oh, that is so romantic. 
 [Laughs] 
 I don't know how romantic it was sitting across from Wendy way... way... 
 Wegweiser. 
 We-weg-we-wegweiser. 
 Wendy Wegweiser. 
 Daniel : Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, and her pet ferret, Willie. 
 What? She has a pet ferret? 
 She has a pet ferret, yes. 
 And many, many photos. 
 [Indistinct conversation, laughter] 
 Will you excuse me? 
 Wendy Wegweiser. Wait. She dresses up her ferret? 
 Are you serious? 
 Karen, are you in here? Everything okay? 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm fine. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Obviously something's wrong. 
 This is it. 
 What is? 
 This is gonna be my whole life. 
 I'll always be alone. 
 Sweetie, that's not true. 
 Now, you've just had some bad luck, some bad dates. 
 But it... it'll get better. 
 It's not just about the dates. 
 It's the way I feel in the world. 
 Around people. All of the time. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you mean? 
 I'm lonely, Savi. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Everything that happened to me, I can't... 
 Move past it. 
 [Sighs] 
 But I can't share it. 
 Why do you feel that way? 
 Because no one understands. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh... apologize to everyone for me? 
 Of course. 
 [Voice breaking]: I've got to get home. 
 It's okay. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Sorry. 
 No, don't be sorry. 
 [Sighs] 
 I think that went well, you know? 
 April seemed to have a good time. 
 Savi? 
 Yeah. 
 I like Daniel a lot. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well... 
 Is everything okay with Karen? 
 She's having a hard time right now. 
 I think it's hard for her, after everything she went through last year, to make small talk with strangers. 
 Or anyone. 
 Even you guys? 
 I think when you go through that trauma, you put distance between you and the people that you're closest to. 
 It, uh, sort of puts things in perspective, doesn't it? 
 What? 
 Well, you've been through a lot, too. 
 But you got past it. 
 Look at you, you know? Look at us. 
 We made it to the other side, and we're in a good place. 
 You know, I'm just, uh... I'm... I'm just grateful. 
 Me too. 
 Um... 
 Listen. I, uh... 
 I have to tell you something. 
 It's about Toni. 
 Uh-oh. 
 No, no. 
 No, it's not what you think. I mean... 
 [Sighs] 
 You were right. 
 She told me she has feelings for me. 
 When? 
 Last week. And I-I should have told you right then. 
 But I-I know how much she gets under your skin already, and I just didn't want to rock the boat any more. 
 Rock the boat? 
 I-I... Look, I-I was wrong. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is why we went to H.R. 
 Yeah. 
 [Clears throat] 
 I told you she was after you. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Oh, why are men so blind about this stuff? 
 Why are you so blind about this stuff? 
 Look, I just want you to know that I heard you the other day. 
 I just... 
 I just don't want there to be any secrets between us. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Let's get some sleep. 
 I don't know if you saw that one. 
 Oh, my God, I loved that one. That was you? 
 You know, sometimes you find the right script and you just have to make it happen. 
 Mm. Well, I, for one, am very glad you did. 
 Mm, me too. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know what? Will you just give me one second? 
 Uh, yeah, sure. 
 Whoa, hey! 
 Probably not the only one here eating two, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 Come on, dude. You're totally stressing me out. 
 You're like a labradoodle over here. 
 Well, I have been called many things in my time, but never a labradoodle. 
 You look like a lost puppy, sitting here all by yourself. 
 You're making me feel bad. 
 Don't feel bad. I'm... I'm fine. 
 You know, why wouldn't I be? 
 I've got all the pretzel rolls I can handle. 
 'Cause you thought you were going on a date, which isn't your fault, but... now you're not. 
 Yeah, no, that's true. Th-that part happened, yeah. 
 I tell you what. 
 Why don't you give me... 
 60 seconds of awkward-date conversation, all right? 
 Ugh. 
 Give me 60 seconds, all right, and then I will go hit on that lovely young woman in the purple dress over there. 
 You just think you can get some business out of her, don't you? 
 I feel like she could definitely benefit from a... a rhinoplasty. 
 Maybe an eyebrow lift. And then I could... 
 I think even I could do something with that chin, to be honest with you. 
 [Laughs] 
 You little hustler. I'm a hustler? 
 I wasn't the one stuffing business cards in my boobs. 
 Oh... did you see that? 
 Everybody saw it. 
 Aah, I thought I was being subtle. 
 No, that's okay, I admire the move. 
 You know, a less original girl would have probably just used her purse. 
 [Both laugh] 
 You're funny. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm. 
 All right, Doc. Do me. 
 Huh? 
 [Laughs]: To perfect this. 
 Nothing. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You can tell me. I won't get mad. 
 Okay. Um... let's see. 
 I would probably tell you to get out of my office because you're stunning. 
 Isn't she, though? You mind if I steal her back? 
 We were, uh, talking a bit of business. 
 Yeah, we were. 
 Okay. 
 No, I wouldn't want to get in the middle of that business. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 That went well, didn't it? 
 It was nice. Yeah. 
 Though the beginning was a little, uh... 
 Your friends seemed nervous. 
 Oh, they did? 
 Yeah, like they were afraid to talk about themselves. 
 [Groans] 
 I'm sorry. That was my fault. 
 I think I might have freaked them out beforehand. 
 I told them not to talk about certain things, and it just made them weird. 
 Sorry. 
 What things? 
 What? Like, they a bunch of criminals? 
 [Laughs] 
 No. 
 What? So you thought I was gonna judge them or something? 
 No! No, not at all. The things were about me. 
 Private things, you know. 
 Private things. 
 Personal things. 
 Okay. 
 You're upset. 
 Well, I thought we were moving forward. 
 We are. 
 You wanted to meet my people. 
 To get to know you more. Okay? 
 Or... or to share more of your life. Not... not to make four new friends. No, you know, it's okay. Like, maybe... Maybe we just don't want the same things. We do want the same things. Daniel I wanna be with you. Look, it's late, okay? You know, we're both tired. Maybe I should just go home. Oh, no, come on. Please come inside. Good night, April. [Sighs] I just... I-I-I don't understand what all these fees are for. I'm not overdrawn. W-what's my balance minimum? Okay. Well, just hold it, just listen to me. I would pretty much be there if you would put back in what you took out for those ridiculous fees. No, are you... are you seriously doing this over a-a difference of $2? [Knock on door] No, you know what? Hold on. [Sighs] Yes? Hi, Josslyn Carver? Yeah. I have a delivery for you. Just need your signature. Okay. And initial here. Okay. Sorry. I'm in the middle of something. And initial here. And one more time. Thank you very much. Just you can just leave it... Oh, leave it right there. [Gasps] [Whines] Whoa, wh... No, sir, this isn't for me. [Chuckles] Enjoy. [Stammers] What? What's going on? Who do you belong to? "I think there was some confusion last night. Here is a labradoodle for your ref..." Come on. [Laughs] Are you kidding me? I'd like to talk about something you said about your escorting, that you felt it kept you from spending nights alone. Did I say that? You did. [Laughs] Well, that's pathetic. It's not just that. It's... Fun, too. I mean... really fun. What's fun about it? Well, everything. Every moment. I walk in. It's a nice place. I'm wearing something gorgeous, silk, cashmere... It feels good on my skin. I walk by a table of men and I feel them looking at me, wanting me. [Laughs] I walk to the bar, watch the door, I see him walk in, but I pretend I don't know him. He pretends he doesn't know me. He likes that... Feeling like it's some kind of chance meeting. He likes feeling like, out of all those guys in the bar watching... [Chuckles] He won. And he doesn't know me, really. He thinks my name is Kate. And who is Kate? Whoever I want her to be. No past, no problems. She's totally free. [Chuckles] [Knock on door] Coming. Hi. Oh, good. You got them. What are these? They're Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets. You like them, don't you? How did you know that? Do you want to come inside? What else did you find out about me online? That my girlfriend left me and that I'm living on my friend's couch? No, I just felt bad about what happened the other day. I wasn't nice, and I wanted to apologize to you. I told you I didn't want anything from you. But you must, because you could have just tore up those tickets. But instead you showed up at my doorstep. Again. Look... The accident really... Really messed me up. And I thought that if I came here and found you a little... A little broken, too, that I wouldn't have to feel so ashamed about it. But... You're not. You're fine. You haven't lost a damn thing. You have no idea what I have lost. I don't even know who I am anymore. Yeah, I'm surrounded by my friends and... and... at my old job and in my house, but... [Sighs] I don't recognize myself in any of them. And you know why that is? Because I was supposed to be a mother by now. I'm sorry. I... I didn't... didn't know. [Voice breaking]: Oh, and I was ready. I was so... I was so ready. [Sighs] I bought the crib and the clothes... And I... I had names picked out. And I could feel her inside me every moment of every day. [Sniffles] I know what it feels like to lose everything that you've been building, but, you know, you can get it back. I may never have that chance again. [Sighs] [Sighs] I was married. His name was Paul. We went to high school together. We're not married anymore. Can that be enough for now? [Chuckles] One cold Brewski. Wow. Looks like you got plenty of leads there. That's great. Yeah, I got tons of business cards. One gig. [Sighs] I mingled my face off at that party, Harry, and that's all I have to show for it. Mm. It's not enough. This was a mistake. It's... it's my big mistake, it's not you. I'm sorry. One gig might not be enough, but, uh, the two I got should put us in the green. Or black. Whatever. What are you talking about? Mm. Yeah, some jewelry launch. And another intimate dinner party for 150 people. Oh, my God, what?! When?! Well, it seems you can drum up a lot of business while you're, uh, hiding from your date. Boom. What is this? My share of the investment. 2,500 clams. What? Oh, I... I... No. Let's just call it even. Keep it. Okay. Yeah, for a, uh, commitment-phobe, you're pretty good at being all-in. I want you to know that I am, too. Oh, yeah, one more thing. I broke up with Kyra. Oh, thank God. [Chuckles] Yeah, last night was the "aha" moment I needed. So thank you for that. Aha. Appreciate it. Oh, and I'm really sorry about all that Scott business. That was really awkward. Actually... he was not that bad. Really? I know. Man : When we come back, is a common household product a threat to your pets? That's next on eyewitness news. Announcer : Come on down prices so low you'll think... [Click] Hey. Hey. How was your day? [Sighs] Uneventful. I really... have to pee. [Laughs] [Laughs] [Exhales sharply] [Laughs] [Cellphone ringing, vibrating] I can't talk right now. Chardonnay, please. What's your name? I'm Jennifer.
