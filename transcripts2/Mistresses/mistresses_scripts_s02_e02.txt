 Previously on "Mistresses"...  
 Mickey : Have you talked to him yet? 
 Both : Who? 
 Sexy smoldering. 
 Who? 
 I'm Daniel. 
 Your work is beautiful. 
 Does throwing parties actually constitute a career? 
 It does if you live in Los Angeles. 
 You need a caterer. 
 I'm arguably one of the best chefs in this city. 
 A woman tried to kill me, and a young man died from my mistakes. 
 Dom : Hello, gorgeous. 
 I think I'm ready to come back to work. 
 Want to go meet your new roommate? 
 Toni. 
 Hello, Boss. 
 ♪ 
 Whoa. 
 What? 
 Just... wow! 
 This? 
 Yeah. 
 Well... 
 You going clubbing? 
 Will you pass me my teasing comb, please? 
 No. Why would you ask me if I was going clubbing? 
 Uh, here's your teasing comb, and, oh, I don't know. 
 It's my first day back at work. I'm excited. 
 Sure. 
 "Sure"? 
 She's got nothing on you. 
 [Smacks lips] Who? 
 Toni. 
 Toni who? 
 Toni tan? Toni taut? 
 Toni tumbling out of her v-neck? 
 You are hotter. 
 Excuse me. 
 A-a-and smarter. 
 I know. 
 Oh, you know? Just by looking at her? 
 No, I know just by looking at you. 
 I know when you're lying. 
 And you were lying about the first one, mister. 
 I love you. 
 You better. 
 Get your fix now, because once we get into the office... 
 Yeah. It's better no one knows about us. 
 Yeah. I mean, I don't need anyone to know. 
 The scrutiny, the judgment. I'm partner less than a year. 
 Yeah, right, you're partner less than a year, and I certainly don't need any more attention. 
 I'm nervous enough going back to work with everyone wondering whether or not I lost brain function in the coma. 
 Why would you think that? 
 Because Mitchell asked me point-blank if I lost brain function in the coma. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 So, uh, we keep it to ourselves. 
 Yeah. Right. I mean, you know, as far as anyone knows at the office, we're just co-workers and friends. 
 Right. Okay. 
 Right. 
 Well, technically, I'm your boss... 
 [Smooches] 
 [Sighs] 
 You're going into business with Harry? 
 It's not the flesh trade, April. It's party planning. 
 Relax. 
 I know, but how is that gonna work? 
 I have no idea. 
 Hence this very important meeting. 
 You're meeting Harry here? 
 W-w-where would you have me do it, April? 
 Around the breakfast table with Dom? 
 Wait. He and Savi sleep at the house? 
 Sometimes, yes. 
 Mm. How is that for you? 
 "Second chance at life" s*x it's... 
 [Shudders] louder than normal-people s*x. 
 You'll need a plate of scones. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, eventually, I'm gonna get an office, or a kitchen... Or a koffice. 
 I just want to make sure that Harry understands the way that I work. 
 Hey, do you think that me being his boss is gonna make things weird between us? 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Oh. Who's Daniel? 
 Um, I don't kno... 
 [Gasps] 
 Ohh! Daniel... The artist. 
 [Gasps] Sexy smoldering? 
 Mmhmm. 
 Did you sleep with... you slept with him?! 
 [Gasps] Shh! Shh! Shh! [Chuckles] 
 [Cellphone clicks] 
 Hello. April Malloy. 
 Oh. Hello. 
 I-I did? 
 Oh, no. 
 I-I-I hadn't even noticed. [Chuckles] 
 Okay. 
 Thanks for calling. 
 Bye. [Cellphone clicks] 
 What? 
 I left my earring at his loft. 
 You "left your earring" at his loft? 
 No, I didn't "leave" my earring. 
 I left my earring. 
 It must've fallen out when we were... 
 Ripping each other's clothes off. 
 Kill me now. 
 Why?! This is amazing. 
 I'm sorry, does it not seem like I left my jewelry at his house in a childish ploy to see him again? 
 Yeah. No, it totally does. 100%. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? Obvi... April. 
 Obviously, he wants to see you, or he wouldn't have called. 
 Well, what makes you think I want to see him? 
 Oh. It wasn't good. 
 Oh, no. It was good. 
 It was... 
 [Chuckling] Damn. 
 But it... it just... it wasn't... 
 Circumcised? 
 No, it wasn't... Me. 
 Okay, what does that even mean? 
 An uninhibited free spirit had s*x with that hot bohemian, not this stress case who sells ottomans and bath salts and single-handedly raises an 11-year-old girl. 
 An 11-year-old girl who is at astrocamp for the next two days. 
 I'm not doing it, Joss. Nope. Nope. 
 As great as the night was, I am horrified that it happened, and I have already moved on. 
 Oh, but you can pick up the earring for me. 
 What? 
 It's a half-carat diamond. 
 Oh, please, Joss? 
 [Cellphone ringing] Okay, I just... you need to breathe. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Uh, dude, You better be on your way, 'cause you're 20 minutes late. 
 I got us a gig. 
 You got us a what? 
 A party. A dinner. 
 Oh. A gig. 
 Um, okay. Let me pull up the calendar. 
 When is it? 
 Tomorrow night, baby. 
 Tomorrow night?! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Is there a problem? 
 Uh... W... Harry, I... 
 The client's Janine Winterbaum. 
 She'll be at the house to meet us in 45 minutes. 
 Dress cute. I'll see you there. 
 D... 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Karen : Room 206 was supposed to be mine. 
 I have a patient coming in! 
 It says "cancer support" right here. 
 I see what it says now, but someone erased my writing. 
 That's not possible. 
 It's very possible. 
 It's the whole concept of a whiteboard! 
 Dr. Blakeley wants to see you. 
 Okay. 
 I think Mary hates me. [Sighs] 
 Mary's a thief. 
 Steal your room For the O.A. meeting today? 
 Cancer support. 
 Ah, those whiny, hairless bastards. 
 [Gasps] 
 Kidding. 
 Clearly. 
 So, you need a space for your session today? 
 Yes. 
 Well, use my office. 
 Thank you, Irving. Thank you. 
 Wait, wait. Uh, we're not done. 
 I got a call from your lawyer this morning. 
 What does she want? 
 Sit down. 
 It seems Elizabeth Grey is up for release from central state psych. 
 And Natalie wanted you, my shrink,  to break the news to me in case I had feelings about it? 
 Don't you? 
 My feelings are irrelevant to her parole, aren't they? 
 Not necessarily. 
 You can testify. You can write a statement. 
 No, thank you. 
 If you feel she's a continuing threat, it could have considerable sway. 
 I have rounds to do and a new patient to see. 
 Can I go now? 
 Of course. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ 
 [Sighs] Hi. 
 Hi. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Chuckling] Um, this is embarrassing. 
 Could I just have the... 
 The earring back. 
 [Sighing] Yeah. 
 Here. 
 Well, then. 
 ♪ 
 Toni : I know, cariño, but you can't have it all. 
 You must give her the yacht unless you want to give up the condo. 
 Still in love with the wife. It's so heartbreaking. 
 Phenomenal shoes. Where did you get them? 
 A b... 
 Okay. Esto es lo que vamos a hacer. 
 Te vas a tomar una copita de vino, y después te vas a relajar. Okay? 
 Bueno. Adiós. 
 Good morning! Buenos días! 
 "Savannah" or "Savi"... what should I call you? 
 Savi's fine. 
 How are you? 
 Are you good? Is this okay like this, the desks? 
 I mean, We can turn mine around, but you'd be staring at my ass all day. 
 We wouldn't want that. 
 We should go to lunch and get to know each other. 
 I heard you almost died. 
 See you for a minute? 
 Oh, I, uh... I meant Savi. 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 Â¡Qué tonta yo! 
 I got so used to that being my signal all this time. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Uh, how's the day going? 
 Great. 
 Yeah, that was... You know the Breitling Hotels? 
 Uh, I'm talking about the Vintage in New York, Le Petit Apartment in Paris. 
 Anyway, luxury, boutique hotels all over the world. 
 Wait... Andre Breitling? 
 Yeah, I just saw him on "Bill Maher." 
 [Chuckling] What makes him an expert in politics? 
 Savi, he's coming in today. 
 Now, you up to it? I mean, I don't want to overwhelm you. 
 Too late. You already do. 
 All right, well, let's prep, then. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, your office? 
 Uh, you know, let's... Let's use your office, please. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughter] 
 Well, Janine, you did have your own table at Savannah's. 
 [Laughing] Yes. 
 Right by the kitchen, with a view of your gorgeous mug. 
 [Laughs] Look at that face. 
 You know what I was just saying to Alan yesterday? 
 Well, after Kincaid had his "mini stroke" and said he couldn't do the party. 
 I said, "do you know what I miss? 
 I miss tasting Harry." 
 Harry : Aww. 
 That's... that's always nice to hear, isn't it? 
 Is it, though? [Chuckles] 
 Let's just chat real quick about the event. 
 Um, so, it's a charity dinner for lupus. 
 Locusts. 
 Madagascar's still recovering from that awful swarm. 
 You know, it threatened 60% of their rice crop. 
 I-I didn't know that. 
 Oh, speaking of which, I was thinking we should take rice off the menu completely, Harry, and replace it with a more... compassionate starch. 
 Yeah, yeah, he... he can, uh, figure out the menu as soon as we choose a theme. 
 But you've already decided the menu. 
 Oh, he did? 
 This morning. 
 Yeah. Yeah, he faxed it over. 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 Do you just... care if I take a gander at that? 
 Sure. And I think what you were saying is right, Harry. 
 With your lamb as the main, we should run with the Moroccan vibe. 
 Turn my home into "Arabian nights." 
 Y-y-yes. Yes! 
 You could have, uh, mosaic tables, you could have a caidal tent if you want. 
 Oh. Oh. Leather poufs instead of chairs. 
 Oh! 
 You know, just... it's... but 75 people. 
 That's... that's... that's a lot of poufs. 
 Money is no object. 
 No, but just time kind of is. 
 Hmm? Hmm? 
 Oh. Pbht. Joss tends to doubt herself sometimes. 
 But she gets the job done in the end. 
 [Pan simmering] 
 Mmm! 
 Smells like heaven in here. 
 Oh, uh, you like spicy? 
 I do. 
 Okay. 
 Bardolino. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mmm. That's good. 
 Mm? Ooh. Come here. 
 Where? 
 Here. 
 Here? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mm... 
 [Laughs] 
 I'm sorry. 
 What? 
 It's just... 
 I mean, this is ridiculous. 
 I don't even know you, and you're feeding me. 
 I think it's safe to say  that that's the least of my offenses. 
 [Laughs] 
 Um... Is there anything you want to talk about? 
 No. I don't need to. 
 You? 
 No. I-I'm cool. Are you cool? I'm cool. No, 'cause if you want, I'm open. Just feed me. Yes, ma'am. The language-immersion program in his international hotels should've been patented, like, years ago. Um, I've also made a list of his legal issues. Let's not be negative. No, no. Not negative... just prepared. And these bullet points are my solutions. [Chuckles] You so want to kiss me right now. Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] Well, I'm glad you liked it. Oh, I loved it. But it wasn't as romantic as your hotel Cala d'Or in Majorca. [Laughs] [Breitling laughs] Mr. Breitling. Dominic Taylor. Yes, Mr. Taylor. We spoke on the phone. I see you've met one of our associates, Antonia Ruiz. Sorry... I was just passing by, and I could not resist introducing myself. Yes, apparently, I am personally responsible for many of her best international love affairs. [Both laugh] [Chuckles] Savi Davis. Pleasure to meet you. Well, I'll let you all get to it. Oh, please. I have no secrets. Oh. Well, um... Uh... There are enough chairs at the table. Bravo. [Indistinct voices] Elizabeth : You pathetic, lonely bitch. [Exhales sharply] Hi, Anna. It's Dr. Kim. We had an appointment at 4:00. It's 7 after. No big deal. Just thought I'd call to remind you that it's office 209. Okay. Mm. [Telephone ringing] [Sighs] [Sighs] Don't pick it up, Karen. [Gun cocks] [Knock on door] [Gasps] Dr. Kim? Hi. Anna. Glad you could make it. Please... come on in. [Chuckles nervously] April, honey, a little help here, please. [Monotone] Welcome to Maison sur Mer. Hi. Who are you? Brynn. Brynn, where's April? Not here. Um, okay. I am, uh, April's good friend Joss. I just need to put a bunch of stuff on memo... Everything Moroccan that you have. These linens, I will purchase, obviously. Carved-wood stools... Anything, uh, mosaic works, as well. [Gasps] This lamp is perfect! But that's not for sale. Of course it's for sale. Everything in here's for sale. But it doesn't matter. I'm not buying it. I'm putting it on a memo. I don't know what that is. [Scoffs] Okay. [Cellphone beeps] [Sighs] April, it's me. I'm at your store. I need you. Okay, here. Y-you know... you know what? It's fine. Just... just put it all on this card and then just void it [Cellphone chimes] when I come back, okay? Oh, my God! W-where am I gonna find 100 votives at 7:00 at night? Go, Brynn! Go! The party's in 24 hours! [Sighs] I'm gonna call April. Good idea. Yes. Go. [Scoffs] Okay. Oh, my God, she's stealing... Hey! [Water running] [Cellphone ringing] [Ringing stops, water running stops] Whoa. You don't have to do all that. [Chuckles] Oh, yeah. I also, uh, bake cookies, sew name tags, and cut meat. You got somewhere to be? Well, you said you were feeling inspired to work, so I didn't want to... get in your way. I was hoping we could work together. Why don't you put down the sponge? [Chuckles] Mm. ♪ [Singing in Spanish] [Sighs] [Singing continues] [Drawer opens] [Drawer closes] [Singing stops] I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Was I singing? I'm sorry. I don't know when I do it. It just happens. [Chuckles] It's fine. [Singing in Spanish] Okay, you know what? Um... Maybe we should... time-share the office. For instance, if you're off-site, taking a deposition or something or at a lunch meeting,  then I can use the office. Or if I'm at a meeting, say... in the conference room,  then you can use the office. You're mad about the meeting. No. Oh. I intruded on your meeting with Andre. I'm pushy. I'm sorry. It's fine. It's fine. He liked you, and the whole objective was to woo the client. Aww. Well, he liked you, too. Let's just hope he chooses our firm. And your idea is a good one. No use for us To be on top of each other. Why don't you have the first shift? You sure? Absolutely. It'll give me an excuse to go hang out with Dom. Got to get me some of that. Anna Choi, 25. Severe chronic depression. Oh, Karen. Thank you for being here. She showed up to the session 15 minutes late, citing reluctance to come back to the hospital. Patient spent much time fixated on this point. Maybe you could tell him you were screwing his father. [Voice breaking] Stop. But you love her, Sam. But you love her, Sam, don't you? [Voice breaking] Just like your father did. Patient clearly experiencing fear... Avoidance... Not quite ready to face herself. I said don't turn around. [Gunshot] Stop it! Get out! Get out of here!! [Crying] 
 
 That house belonged to my mother. It's stunning. East coast? Vermont. Yeah, she was a maid there for 34 years. Boss died, and he just left it to her. Oh, wow. Well, he knew that nobody was gonna take care of it the way she did. Yeah. She cared for it the way she cared for him. [Chuckles] Is your mom... ? She died. Uh... Six years ago this May. But this is the life she wanted for me. You know, surrounded by nature, summers to dream in, winters that slap you in the face and make damn sure you wake up. [Chuckles] You know, and plenty of space... to fill with generations of love. Savi : Okay, so, while I am powerpointing, you know, and... and citing the latest legislation, she's flipping her hair and giggling at the client, a-and her cleavage is like a whole other person in the room! And then she flat-out tells me that she wants to have s*x. With Dom. What?! Yeah. She told you this?! Uh-huh. But she doesn't know you're together. No. I mean, no one does. But, still, the bitch is after my man. Can't have that. Can't have that. How about you? How was work? How was your first session back? Fine. Weird. Patient spent most of the time talking about how she hated being back at the hospital. Plus, I was very [sighs] distracted. Hmm. Can't imagine why that would be. Maybe it has something to do with Elizabeth being up for release? How did you... We're her lawyers, remember? Right. Of course. Right. You gonna give a statement? No. No? She's psychotic. She tried to kill me. She killed her own son. They're not gonna let her out. I am really sorry to be the one to say this to you, but I feel like if you don't show up, it's a vote for her release. I-I'm sorry. I-I mean, I don't mean to sound insensitive. Oh, sweetheart. You're still scared. [Sighs] I thought I was over it. [Voice breaking] I felt healthy. I mean, at the beginning, I was a wreck. Went to Sam's grave every day. Then twice a week. Then once a week. I sought out therapy for myself. [Sniffles] Of course, it quickly became clear that it wasn't just about that day. It was about that monstrous woman and how she tortured me for a year. I was starting back to my practice, and just the mention of her name today... And I'm right back where I started. She haunts me, Savi. And I think she always will. And that's exactly why you have to do this. Whatever it takes to keep her locked up. [Moroccan music playing] Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! The ice mint tea's for cocktails. The samovar goes out later, okay? I told you. Dave, Dave, you're peeling it too thick, mate. Okay? The zucchini needs to ribbon, yeah? A ribbon. Oh! Okay. Well, the camel guy showed up, so that's a relief. What would I have done with this fork-horned saddle? Uh, you're late. Did you get the votives? No, I did not. Why not? Seriously? Harry, I got a camel... A real, live, leaf-eating, cud-chewing camel. I-I-I did lanterns instead. They're... they're glass, they're gorgeous. Let's move on. Well, you c... Well, hey, hey. Don't leave this stuff here. Wait... Joss! What?! It didn't look like there were enough poufs out there. I mixed them with carved stools. She told you specifically she wanted poufs. She also said that she wanted hookers when she really meant hookahs. Harry, it took me 6 1/2 hours to figure that out. Well, she's not gonna be happy, Joss, so get... Hello! How's it going in here? Hi! Harry : [Chuckling] Hey, perfect. You look fantastic. Fabulous caftan. Oh, it's Mrs. Roper off her meds. [Chuckles] Looks terrible. I love it. Whatever. Anyway, can I have a taste? Oh, yeah. Uh... This is harira. Mmm! Huh? Oh, it's exquisite. Huh? [Chuckles] You're exquisite. Mm. Thank you both. My pleasure. Our pleasure. You, uh, hungry, thirsty? I don't need a thing. You're dressed again. I am. You're leaving. [Sighs] I have to. No! No, you don't. Mm... No, I... [Inhales sharply] I do. Stay. I have to pick up my daughter. She gets home from her school trip tonight. Okay. I should probably get some sleep anyway. I'm flying to Vermont tomorrow. Oh. Uh, for how long? Probably a week. Um, possibly a little bit more. I usually play it by ear. [Chuckles softly] Well, have a safe trip. Hey. Hi. Congratulations. We got the Breitling account. We did? Mm-hmm. [Chuckling] Oh, that's awesome. We're a good team, huh? Mm-hmm. But, um, he, uh, he wants Toni, too. W-which, considering the size of the account and the fact that you're only part-time, may be a good thing. [Inhales deeply] What if I can't work with Toni? Okay. Uh... [Clears throat] Want to tell me why? Uh, for starters, the constant flirting... with the clients, the partners. I mean, it's embarrassing. Gloria Steinem would roll over in her grave. I don't think she's dead. Is that really the point, Dom? W-why are you so upset? Why aren't you more upset? I mean, she made a total fool of you in front of Breitling, undermined your authority... Made a fool of me? Really? No, I just... I mean, I-I didn't want her to stay,  but I-I just didn't want to seem partial to you. I know. I know. I'm sorry. I just... Look. She told me... That she wants to sleep with you. [Laughs] Why is that funny? I-I don't know. That... that it's meaningless. How is that meaningless? Because it's never gonna come to anything. Because, "A," I don't want it to,  and, "B," I'm with you. I was actually with someone... taken... when we got together, Dom. Savannah, come on. No. I was married to Harry. I loved him, and I swore that I would never betray him. But you know what? I did. Eventually, I did. Okay? So it is possible. If this is gonna work, you are gonna have to trust me. C-can you do that? I don't know. [Scoffs] You don't know? Do you trust me? Of course I do! Well, maybe you shouldn't. Okay. [Chuckling] Okay, this is... This is, uh... Crazy. This is... Okay, the more blasé you are about this, the more worried I'm getting. Can't you see that? I just don't know what you're doing. I'm being aware, Dom. Of myself, of us, of who we are and how we got here. I mean, look, you and I, we're both capable Of incredible deceit, okay? And for you to pretend like that's not true, it means you're not watching yourself. Which means that I have to. And I j... I don't want to. Gris de Guerrouane? No, thanks. Ahhh. To a man, Harry, your cuisine was delicious. [Chuckles] Happy you were happy. Yes. [Clears throat] But, Joss, let me start by saying that normally, when I ask for something, I get it. And yesterday, when I asked for poufs, that's what I expected. But in this case, the carved stools [chuckling] worked out so much better. I mean, I had guests over 60 that needed support for their ass, and you gave it to them. Yeah. Plus, it was so cool and eclectic and... I don't know... just the best party I've ever had. Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow! Ooh! Thank you so much, Janine. [Chuckling] Yes. I will e-mail both of you tomorrow with a testimonial for your website. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am pooped and drunk. [Chuckles] Good night, kiddos. Mwah! Good night. Good night. [Chuckles] Yes! Joss, we did it. The client was happy. That party was awesome. This will definitely lead to more events. Yeah, listen, Harry, I'm thrilled that Janine was so pleased, and, frankly, I have never been more proud of myself, but there is not a chance in hot hell  that I will ever work with you again. [Sighs] My name's Karen Kim. I'm here to see the review board. If you feel threatened at any time anywhere on the floor, press this button. Thank you. [Metal detector chirping] [Buzzer] [Door creaks] [Indistinct conversations] [Police radio chatter] Karen. You came. I'm up for review. I know. It's not so terrible in here. I like this room. There's a view of a sycamore tree. See there? How are you? [Sighs] Sober. Finally. Remarkably. [Chuckles lightly] I'm so sorry, Karen. I was hoping you'd come... So I could say that. Say that I'm sorry. I'm fine. [Voice breaking] I killed my son. How could I do that? How could I live with that? [Sobbing] That's my punishment. This. I asked them for a day out so... I could see his grave. They said no. I just want to see his grave. It's beautiful. You've seen it? Many times. There are always flowers. Mmm. Nothing like a New York bagel. Burbank. No! Wait... so you just left? Yep. What do you mean "yep"? I am no longer afraid of Elizabeth Grey. I was sad for her, actually. Oh, and the board rejected her release. [Exhales sharply] Bury the lead, why don't you? Good morning. You! Where have you been, woman? I left you like 20 messages. I know. I'm so sorry, honey. I was M.I.A. I was... I picked up the earring. [Gasps] What?! What's the earring? What are you guys talking about? The hot, sculpture, artist guy. Ohhh! I was at his place for, like, 48 hours... The most incredible two days of my life. You slept with sexy smoldering? You're lagging. Catch up. Come on. So what's next? Um... Nothing. Nothing. He's never calling again. Oh, would you stop it? Yes, he will. What? No, I [sighs] I'm telling you, he's not. Everything changed as soon as I mentioned Lucy was coming home. I read it on his face. You know, you misread faces all the time. Yeah, well, he also said he was going out of town for a week. Yeah, he's never calling again. That's the pre-dump. Nice friends. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. I am... I am at peace with it. I am grateful that it happened, and I am fine with it not happening again, never feeling that way again, [Voice breaking] The best I ever felt about myself with another person. Oh, sweetie. Sweetie. [Door opens] Oh. Sorry. Hi, Harry. Hey, Harry. It's okay. Oh, you... you don't have to go. Mm... No, we'll go. I'm going. So good to see you, though. It's good to see you. You look great. She's in love. Ah... Ohh! Uh, so, you meeting the broker here? I thought everything was settled. No. I'm here to talk to Joss. What do you want, Harry? I've come to say I'm sorry. Oh. For questioning the stools. The stools? What about hijacking the entire meeting with Janine and speaking for me and being condescending to me and texting me all freakin' day and then yelling at me all night? You're a yeller. Well, yeah. O-only in the kitchen. Okay, well, we would be working together in a kitchen, so that makes a little bit of a problem, doesn't it? Yeah. You're right. Sorry. I-I was... controlling. You were a bully. I get that way when I feel cornered. Cornered? Who was cornering you? [Chuckles] Uh... Life... Circumstances? I don't know. Look, the past eight months have been rough. You know, I-I just... I've lost a lot... Savi, the restaurant... Soon, the house. I just... I really needed this to work, you know? I'm sorry, Joss. I-I couldn't see myself leaving anything to chance. Well, I'm not chance, Harry. No, I know you're not. I'm really good at my job. You're great. I got to say, you really surprised me. What are you... [Scoffs] I'm not a kid anymore. [Chuckles] You know, Harry, the past eight months have really sucked for me, too. I've had to take care of everything around here. I know... on your own. Yeah. Yeah. You did really good. I mean, you got to admit it, though... we rocked that party. We rocked it. I mean, that was our very first gig, and we kicked its Arabian ass. Our instincts were good. It was great. We just got to, you know, iron out the kinks. You will never be my boss. Absolutely. Ever. Ever. I bring clients, you bring clients, I cook, you plan... done. Okay. So... like partners? Yeah. If... if you'll have me. So, a designer comes in and wants to borrow a piece. You fill out this form. Okay? Run the credit card for 20% of the price and refund the money when they bring it back. Will that blond girl be coming in again? Often. She's a yeller. I've got inventory to do. Oh. Hey, I forgot to tell you... something came in this morning I wasn't expecting. It wasn't on the receiving list. What? This big, weird thing. I put it in the back. - [Knock on door] Hi, Anna. Hi. Come on in. This place is great. Better, right? [Chuckles] Thank you, Dr. Kim. Why don't you call me "Karen"? Hi. Hi. [Sighs] Are we in a fight? Don't ask me. I mean, I tend to be blasé about these things. [Sighs] I'm sorry. No. No. D-don't be. Don't be. Y-you were... you were right. I don't... see the whole picture enough. Look, you, um... You feel so right to me, Savannah. I mean, being with you now feels so right to me that I don't think about how we started. You know what would be great? What? If we focused on something else. Like how... we chose each other, even when it wasn't the easiest thing to do. And... [Sighs] I can work with Toni. You don't have to. No. I can find a way to work on it. It's okay. It's okay. You sure about that? Yeah. As long as we have this to ourselves...  I can do that. Yeah.
