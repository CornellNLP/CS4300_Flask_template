 Let's do it. 
 Do the whole relationship thing. 
 Previously on "Mistresses"...  
 Why are you still here, Paul? 
 I want to see Lucy. 
 You have been so tough on me because that's what mothers do. 
 (Voice breaking) Make sure that you grow up right. 
 These notes are submitted by your husband's psychiatrist. 
 She indicates that your husband may have been suicidal. 
 Obviously, this woman is lying. 
 Sam... 
 I think I'm in love with you. 
 Maybe you could tell him you were screwing his father. 
 That should break the spell. 
 If you keep waking me up this early, I am moving back into the guest house, and I swear, we're never gonna finish "The Wire." 
 I don't even know how you could sleep over this... this... this drip, drip, drip. 
 Well, clearly, you are unaware of how loudly you snore. 
 That trip, drip, drip is like a lullaby. 
 This happens once every few months. 
 Harry says it has something to do with th... the thingy in the doohickey that makes the water come out... 
 I don't... I don't know. If I can... if I can just tighten it. 
 Be careful. 
 (Grunts) 
 Ugh! 
 Woman, calm down. It is just a leak. 
 It's not the end of the world. 
 I'm sorry I'm not thrilled that my house is falling apart. 
 Are you kidding? I love that your house is falling apart. 
 It's much closer to my childhood fantasy of us sharing a crappy Manhattan apartment together. 
 Two sisters living in N.Y.C., and we drink our dinner, stay out all night... it'd be amazing. 
 That would've been great when I was 25 and single, but I'm 37 and pregnant, so, you know... 
 Mmm. 
 Not so much fun. 
 True. 
 (Tools clatter) 
 (Sighs) 
 Oh. Oh. 
 (Sighs and groans) 
 Oh. 
 Everything is broken, and I don't know how to fix it. 
 Literally or metaphorically? 
 Let's start with literally. 
 Well, that's easy. 
 You're psyching yourself out. 
 Sav, you lived all by yourself in that teeny, tiny apartment in Venice for seven years, and you were fine. 
 Yeah, I was fine until I married Harry, and then he didn't let me do anything. 
 I mean, I couldn't even open the mail. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Well, I forgot to send in the D.W.P. bill, and it turned into this whole deal. 
 So he's dealt with the mail and he fixes the leaks and he programs the remote controls for the TVs and changes the water filters, the light bulbs. 
 Wow. And you let him do all of that? 
 I didn't really have a choice. 
 He was kind of old school that way. 
 Kinda like Ricky Ricardo with a different accent. 
 Mm. (Laughs) 
 Wow. 
 (Laughs) It's not that big of a deal. 
 No. No. I... I know, but I just... 
 I really can't picture you giving up that much control. 
 That must've been really hard for you. 
 It was. 
 But you get used to things. 
 (Dripping stops) 
 (Gasps) 
 See? You fixed it. 
 You're fine. 
 Just kidding. 
 There are first graders whose moms don't walk them all the way to the front door. 
 Sorry to embarrass you. 
 No, you're not. 
 You're right. I'm not. 
 Have a good day at school, kiddo. 
 Mom. 
 (Scoffs) 
 (Blows kiss) 
 (Singsongy) April Malloy. 
 Cheryl. 
 The P.T.A. still needs a chairperson for the grandparents and special friends day committee. 
 It is so meaningful to the children and their elderly loved ones. (Speaks indistinctly) 
 Sorry. Cheryl, I have to go. 
 Okay. 
 Start the car and meet me at the park now. 
 Okay. 
 You've reached Savannah Davis. 
 I'm not available to take your call, so leave a message after the beep. (Beep) It's me again. I'm still staring at the summons on my desk where your law firm is basically accusing me of killing Tom. And you're seriously not gonna answer my calls? Early lunch. Oh. Where are we going? Oh. I'll just... wait here. Have you lost your damn mind? I told you. I need to see Lucy. And I told you that wasn't gonna happen. What if she saw you? Do you know what that would do to her? Do you even care? Of course I care. You obviously don't. Hey, I'm sorry. It was a stupid idea. We're way past stupid. Listen to me. I refuse to let you ruin that little girl's life any more than you already have. Lucy was destroyed when she lost her father. I know. You don't know because you weren't there for three years. Why do you suddenly need to see her again now? I never stopped needing to see her. (Voice breaking) Now that I'm here... she's just so close. I'm so sorry, April. I screwed up everything... my life, your life, Lucy's. (Crying) Please. Please. I can't lose Lucy. You can't lose what you don't have. Go back to your family in Florida because you've got no family here. (Car door opens, dog barks in distance) (Car door closes) We need to talk. Karen. What are you doing here? Look, this is not a good time. I can't have this conversation here. You won't call me back. I can't talk about it. Fine. Have you at least told your bosses that Elizabeth Grey's a lying son of a bitch? Yet another thing I cannot do. You know she is. This whole case is ridiculous. Elizabeth is the one who killed Tom, and now she's saying I'm responsible? Why didn't you at least warn me? I took myself off the case. I haven't been getting all the e-mails. Come on, Savi. Karen, I've already given you too much information, and if I had any idea that this investigation was going to become about you, I wouldn't have told you anything. That makes me feel so much better. Karen, I am really sorry, but my job is on the line. My life is on the line. You can't talk to me about it? That's fine. I get it. But I am done playing nice with this woman. Make sure you tell her that I am not going down without a fight. Do you need a lawyer? I can recommend someone. I think that would qualify as yet another conflict of interest. Thanks anyway. (Door closes, footsteps retreat) (Sighs deeply) (Telephone rings) Yes, Olivier? How did you know it was me? (Chuckles) I could smell your Acqua Di Gio from two decades away. (Chuckles) Two prospective clients from New York are in town for the evening. I need to convince them that Los Angeles does not, um, how do you put it... suck... because the restaurants close at midnight. Are they staying in Beverly Hills? Yes. Well, the restaurants there close at 10:00, so I highly suggest that you find them a hotel on The Strip. Bonne idée. Uh, there's more. This couple is, uh, Cosmopolitan. They believe life is a sensuous adventure. Well, then why are they moving to L.A.? The husband is a dip. A dip? No, no, no. Um, a deep. A D.P.? Oui. C'est ça. It means director of photography. He must be in the film business. In any case, I need an unforgettable evening of entertainment, which is why I've come to you. Hmm. So what I'm hearing is you do find me entertaining. You'll accompany me tonight. (Inhales sharply) Sorry. Can't. I'm already booked. I snagged a reservation at Ink, and I'm taking my girlfriend out for our own unforgettable evening. Interesting. You and mademoiselle mala beads have become lovers? Hmm. I've never heard it put like that,  but oui, oui. We have. (Chuckles) I'm sorry. (Laughs) Just a little 5-minute catnap. Mm. Uh, I mean a 35-minute catnap. Go home and rest. Oh, no, I can't. I'm already a week behind on the Lieberman custody case. Work from home. Partners are on retreat. They'll never know. (Yawns) And... okay, you need to take better care of yourself. Go home. Okay. Oh, shoot. So sorry. (Chuckles) Here. Let me get that. Now just... just take it on the house. Okay. Sorry. Free coffee, huh? Count me in. Hi. Hey. Um, shouldn't you be at... at work? I just want to check in. I saw you at the drop-off this morning and wanted to say hi, but you took off so quickly. Um... Everything all right? Did Paul try to contact you again? (Sighs) Worse. Paul showed up at school today. He did what? He wanted to see Lucy without Lucy seeing him. Is that what he said? Don't worry. I told him it's not gonna happen and that he needs to just go back to Florida. And? * And he... broke down. I almost feel bad for him. That's what he wants. Did he say he was leaving? No, but I'm... He's playing you, April. He's trying to worm his way back into your life. No, I... I really don't think so. This guy is a liar and a criminal, and you need to go to the police. But I can't. I've thought about it, but I just don't see how I can do this without getting Lucy involved. Then involve her. Maybe it's time. That's the last resort, and I am not there yet. Unless I am. I don't... I don't... I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to make you more upset. I've done everything I can, but I just... I can't make him do anything. He's not listening to me. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna figure it out. Entrez. Je te rappelle. Okay, do you remember those Choose Your Own Adventure books? Right. They probably weren't translated into French. What are these? Three distinct itineraries. Our prospective couple can choose just how adventurous they want their evening in our fair city to be. I thought you had plans for tonight. I do. But I've booked the limo, made the reservations, and added your name to every velvet rope list in town. The planning's done. All you have to do is close the deal with your... sparkling personality. Was that sarcasm? (Laughs) You know, just when I think you'll never get me. Merci, Josslyn. Mm. I will miss your company tonight. Admit it... you underestimated me when we first met. Perhaps. But perhaps you are different now. Perhaps I am. Have fun. (Water dripping) (Cell phone rings) Everything all right? Hi. Uh, how are you? Is that why you called? N... no. The, um, shower's doing that... that plinking thing again. Well, did you tighten the handle? Uh, I did, yeah, but I don't know. I might not be strong enough. Are you asking me to fix it? If it's not an imposition. Um... I can't today, Savi. I'm swamped. Okay. Uh, don't... don't worry about it. It's fine. Try some bathroom cork around the head. You can get it at any hardware store. Great. Uh, I'll try that. Thanks. You're gonna have to start figuring out how to do this stuff on your own, Sav. (Chuckles) Okay. You're right. I... I gotta go. Okay. Thanks. (Sighs) $80 for an estimate? But I already told you what the problem was. (Doorbell rings) $500? No, thank you. No, thank you. It's a leak, not a flood. Hey. Hi. I thought you could use this. Helped my sister with exhaustion when she was pregnant. Gentle buzz, no side effects. That's... really sweet. And I don't want to seem ungrateful, but it's kind of a long drive for a box of tea, huh? Well, also you forgot this. (Groans) (Chuckles) Not that you have to do any work, but you know,  don't want those Liebermans coming after you. Ugh. Does this tea help with pregnancy brain? Because I officially have it. Well, we could make a cup and find out. Okay. I'm gonna need you to do more research on some of these law firms. My top two choices aren't available, and I'm not comfortable with the rest of these. Of course. When do you need it by? Yesterday. Dr. Kim? Sam. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say right now. I wasn't expecting to see you. I know. I realize I still owe you an explanation and I wanted to call you, but... It's okay. I mean, it's not why I'm here. I know about the lawsuit. I can't discuss that with you. I know. I wanted to apologize. What my mom's doing to you... it's not right. I tried to talk her out of it, but it's no use. She's out for blood. I thought I should warn you. Thank you. I gathered as much. So do you have a plan then? I don't even have a lawyer yet. (Scoffs) Well, that's not good. Sam... Right. I'm leaving. I get it, by the way. What do you get? Everything. As soon as I found out about you and my dad, a lot of things made so much more sense. I hate that you found out the way you did. I should've told you the truth from the beginning. I'm glad you didn't. I never would've gotten to know you if you told me. I wish things could've turned out differently. Me, too. (Miss Li's "My heart goes boom" playing) * I don't need no doctor treating me * (Cell phone rings) (Chuckles) ♪ I don't need no pills or therapy ♪ Hey.

No. No. No. Sit. I got it. (Sets notepad down) Savi. Um, what are you doing here? Joss, right? We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Dominic Taylor. I know who you are. You didn't answer my question. Well, your sister fell asleep at work, so I just stopped by to see if she needed anything. Savi doesn't need anything  while she works things out with her husband. All righty then. And just so you know, I will never wear your t-shirt. I'm on team Harry. Oh, uh, well, good for you. Wow. You're not even gonna try to deny that you have feelings for my sister. She's a good friend. Oh, please. I know what happened. You two are hardly platonic. You're probably right. Then let me be very clear. Okay? Savi loves Harry. You're not gonna win. We'll see. Life's a negotiation, and I'm a damn good lawyer. (Scoffs) I'm sure you are. 
 
 (Knock on door) Paul Malloy? April's friend. Boyfriend. Richard. Can I come in? I saw you two together at her shop. So Lucy's not the only one you've been stalking? You a father, Richard? I am. Then you know better than to talk about another man's child. April sic you on me or something? I came on my own, to get you to do what she asked you to do... leave. Wow. You're really into her, aren't you? I mean, I... I get it. April's an incredible woman. Which makes you God knows what kind of fool to abandon her. I'm still her husband. You're just the guy keeping my side of the bed warm, man. Stay away from April and stay away from Lucy. Or what? Or April might not go to the police, but I will. For your bus ticket home. I don't need your charity, man. Really? 'Cause I've heard you had trouble with money the last couple of years. (Grunts) (Grunts) Uhh! (Grunts) Ah! (Lamp shatters) Dr. Kim? I'm Natalie Wade. I'm sorry. Uh, my assistant must've made a mistake. I don't see a late appointment on my schedule. I'm not a patient. I'm your new attorney. (Closes folder) Is that all you want? It's all you have. (Laughs) Oh. Sorry. I... forgot to do food shopping for, like, the last six years. That's right. He's a... He's a chef. Yep. Yeah. Well, yeah, I'm... I'm not that hungry. It's okay. (Sets bar down) No, it's not okay. I have no food in the house, my plumbing doesn't work, I'm sleeping on the job. Napping. It's okay to be a disaster by myself, but how can you bring a little human being into this crap storm? I mean, mothers are supposed to have it together, you know? I mean... (Scoffs) I'm sure the baby's gonna want to eat something other than mustard. They don't need condiments until they're at least 6 weeks old. (Laughs) (Laughs) Okay. We need a break. Come on. Let's go. Ooh. Mm... Maybe it's not such a good idea. (Water dripping) I'll drive. Okay. Okay. Where do you wanna start? How about we start with who sent you here. (Chuckles) You have friends in high places. Let's leave it at that. I spoke with Huxley Insurance. They uncovered two pharmacy prescriptions for morphine that came from you, which is weird, since you're not an oncologist. I can explain that. You might need to. More pressing is that I believe her attorneys are gonna suggest that you not only prescribed the morphine, but you also administered the fatal dose the night that Thomas died. They're gonna say you did it. What? But I didn't. I believe you. No, Miss Wade, you have to understand. Elizabeth has a vendetta against me. I believe you. This is a civil suit that would only win the income lost due to Thomas' untimely death. Since the doctors only gave him weeks to live, it wouldn't amount to much. So she's not after the money. No. She wants to drag your reputation through the mud. She wants to ruin you, Karen. Okay. Where do we start? We start with one important question... Do you remember where you were the night Thomas passed away? I remember it clearly. I was at home alone. So you don't recall? No, I just said that I was... That you don't recall. Of course, I'd prefer it if you knew who it was that you were with. But if you don't, it's simply okay to say you don't remember. You have an active social life, a lot of friends. Are you sure you weren't with one of them? No. I won't do that. Think about it. So what do you think of L.A.? Oh, it's just so bright. I never see so many people wearing non-ironic pink fluorescent as I drive through L.A. (Man) You mean slog through. Traffic at 2:00 A.M.? How do you put up with it? Oh, I take shortcuts through the canyon in my convertible, but I drive with the top down all year long. (Laughs) Try that during east coast winter, huh? You do have one thing going for you. Your struggling actresses are far more attractive than ours. (Chuckles) Anyway, wait until you taste these Martinis. They are to die. Dinner was lovely and, uh, the fancy Martinis are tasty, but what exactly is so kinky about this itinerary? Five, four, three, two... (Gin wigmore) * oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh * * oh-oh-oh-oh-oh * * oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh * The cabaret may have been created in Paris, but it was perfected in Hollywood. * oh-oh-oh-oh-oh * * oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh * * oh-oh-oh-oh-oh * * I got lots of jealous lovers * * that all wish they had me back * * got a pistol for a mouth * * my old mama gave me that * * making my own road out of gravel and some wine * * and if I have to fall, then it won't be in your line * * everybody's doing it, so why the hell should I? * Whoo! * everybody's doing it * * so why the hell should I? (Laughs) Told ya. * I'm a bad * * woman to keep * * make me mad * * I am not here to please * (crickets chirping) Richard, oh, my God. What happened? I got in a fight. It's not as bad as it looks. Wh... oh, you're bleeding. Really? Still? What kind of fight? Who did this? You should call the police. Yeah, I suggested that, but you said no. What? Oh, my God. Please tell me you didn't. I just wanted to talk to him. You went to see Paul? Are you insane? For the record, I didn't throw the first punch. (Sets bag down) (Scoffs) Why would you do that? You said he wasn't listening to you. So you thought he'd listen to you? I was trying to help. I didn't want your help. I didn't ask for your help. Now you just went and made it a million times worse by going all caveman. This is my situation to deal with. I thought the point of our situation was that we wouldn't have to deal with things alone. Okay, you crossed the line, and if you can't see that... Fine. Richard... No. No. You can't ask me to be your shoulder to cry on when you're upset and then get pissed when I try to help. Either I'm involved or I'm not. So what do you want? Yeah. That's what I thought. I can't remember  the last time I was in jeans, at a mall, on a weekday. Feels pretty good, right? (Inhales sharply) Yeah, I also haven't been to the happy hour, or a movie... Aw. Or eaten processed food. Okay. So you're missing something there, 'cause as far as I'm concerned, cheese just doesn't taste right unless it's nuclear orange. (Laughs) So, um... how far along are you now? Almost nine weeks. Getting excited? Mm, I think I'm more nervous than excited. You? Nervous? I don't believe it. Well, believe it. Which part? Well, it's just... every time I try to figure out what it's gonna be like or... or... or look like, I... I just can't see it, you know, and how am I ever gonna have time to take my kid to a playground? You know, I haven't even had time to buy a stroller or a crib yet. Whoa. You haven't gotten a crib yet? Uh, forget about it. You can't do this. (Slaps back) I'm serious. Okay, look, my mom worked full-time. Somehow I still made it to the park. You know it just... it just happens. No, it doesn't just happen. No, you're right. My mom made it happen. She got food on the table, she got clothes on my back, and for my 4th birthday, she got me the coolest little green bike. It was... I was big on green. And she was all by herself? Mm-hmm. Single mom. I just never imagined that that would be me. You know, none of this is happening the way... I pictured it. So? Just 'cause it's not how you imagined it doesn't mean it can't work. You just have to let go of your expectations. Be happy about life's little surprises, you know, like, uh... like enjoying a lemonade slushie on a Friday night in Glendale. (Chuckles) (Sips) (Laughs) You're gonna be fine, Savannah. And that baby in there... it's gonna be amazing. Oh. Hmm? You mean if it's yours, right? (Laughs) No. Because it's yours. (Boy speaks indistinctly in distance) I've looked at this from every angle. The numbers don't add up. If we don't do something... start lunch service, cut back on staff... Savannah's is done. (Man) * if you want a piece of my mind * What about Savi? I'm not talking about your wife. I'm talking about the restaurant. It's game over if we don't make some serious changes. Right-o. You don't even know the rules to baseball, Harry. Have you listened anything I said? Um, yeah. Um... more customers, more revenue. It's more than that. Look, I took you out tonight so I could have your full attention. Jeff, doom and gloom is your thing, mate. And we always end up in the clear. Don't we? Now relax and have a beer. ♪ Be my wingman? (Chuckles) No, mate. * * oh, oh, oh * * you take a little piece of my heart * * oh, oh * Hey, Savi. It's me. I just wanted to say thanks for your help and I'm sorry about this morning. I'll call you tomorrow. (Dragonette) * 9 A.M. * * In your bedroom * * the radio alarm clock is set for soon * * I know your friends and you know mine, too * (Cell phone rings) * you don't tell on me, I won't tell on you * You are not enjoying yourself. Oh. Sure I am. * * seconds to your elevator from the station * You don't have to lie to me because I'm your boss, Josslyn. * Invitation * You have done outstanding work tonight. It is all that matters. I've been here one time too many. The effect starts to wear off. Ah. You have been, um, overexposed. That's the understatement of the year. * When I ought to say "no" * * here I come when I better go * Honestly, I'd rather be with Alex right now. I feel bad. I haven't even checked in to see how she's feeling. Do you mind if I just slip out, make a call really quick? No. No. Not at all. * You wear commitment well, Josslyn. * * here I come * * I say "yes" when I ought to say "no" * (Laughs) Okay. I got it. Got it? Uh, you want these anywhere in particular? Uh, you can just put 'em right there for now. Okay. (Chuckles) Fixed your shower. Already, huh? Knock yourself out. No, Harry, uh, j... (Sighs) I have the worst timing in history. You okay? He told me to fix it myself. He wasn't supposed to be here. Once he's cooled down, you can tell him what happened. No, he won't believe me. Well, you want me to stay? No. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm not mad at you. I... I get it. I get it. Um... Yeah. They have requested a tour of properties tomorrow... afternoon, of course. They look to be having a long night. Hey. I'm glad I could help. Good. Because you'll be showing them around town. They are officially your clients. Uh. Et voilà here is my car. Bonsoir, madame. (Scoffs) Olivier, you needed a car in L.A., and you chose a Delorean? I love "Back to the future." (Laughs) What? Oh, my God. Are you serious right now? Michael J. Fox... he's a delight, no? Oh, Olivier, I gotta say, never a dull moment. Wow. It's really cool. It looks just like the one in the movie. That was the point. But does it take you back in time? Care to find out? Hmm? Yeah? Oh, my God. (Laughs) Hey. Can I come in? Yeah. You want to see Lucy. This is all you get. When I'm done, you're done. Okay. (Exhales deeply) Her, um... 7th birthday, she fell and skinned her knee playing "red light, green light," so I... let her have two slices of cake. The second grade class trip to Big Bear... it was the first time she'd ever seen snow. Couldn't get her off that sled. Mm. Christmas two years ago... she knew Santa wasn't real, but she played along for me. You still put out my stocking? And your easter basket. And we bake you a red velvet cake on your birthday. I tell Lucy you're with her everywhere she goes. Thank you. (Crickets chirping) Sam, what are you... I just want to check in and see how it went with Natalie. You sent her to me? Uh, I thought she would've told you. No. I thought... Never mind. Thank you for doing that. She's terrific. Yeah. M... my dad hated going up against her in court, so... I figured she had to be pretty good. Why didn't you tell me you were sending her over? If I did, you would've refused my help. You're so used to being there for other people, you're not good at asking for what you need. Would you like to come in? So does she think you have a case? I don't know. It's complicated. I feel strange discussing this with you, Sam. Why? I'm the only other person who knows my mom is lying. Yes, and that's the problem. What do you mean? I was alone that night... the night your father died... which is making things difficult. You need an alibi. I'll figure something out. Use me. No, Sam. Why not? You could say... I was upset about my father dying. I wanted to talk to someone. It'd be easy. I could never ask you to lie for me like that, Sam. You didn't ask. I offered. (Sighs) Hey. How did I get here? I can't believe this is happening. It's gonna be okay. I'm so sorry. Don't be. Just let me help you. I... I want to help you. I'd do anything for you, Karen.
