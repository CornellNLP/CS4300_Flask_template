 I met your boyfriend the other day. 
 I made an appointment to see his work. 
 There was a gorgeous redheaded woman there. 
 Did you find anything you liked? 
 No. But it looked like she did. 
 Previously on "Mistresses"...  
 Joss : Does Dom know you're talking to this guy? 
 Savi : No, I'm working on it. 
 Please keep this to ourselves for right now. 
 Clerk : What's the occasion? 
 My girlfriend and I are gonna try and have a baby. 
 What do you do? 
 I'm an escort. 
 Thank you. 
 Karen? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was just gonna ask you that. Are... are you by yourself? 
 Oh, yeah, my... friend was supposed to meet me for dinner, but she couldn't make it, so... 
 We should have that dinner we talked about, catch up. 
 What are you doing tomorrow night? 
 Tomorrow night? 
 Uh, unless you'd rather play phone tag for the next week and a half. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 No, I'm free tomorrow night. 
 Great. 
 Any place you want to go? 
 [Sighs] You know, I've been out a lot lately. 
 Why don't you come over, and I'll cook us dinner? 
 Really? Since when do you cook? 
 [Cellphone chiming] 
 Ah, it's my brother. I-I should go. 
 But I'll see you tomorrow night, okay? 
 Really glad we ran into each other. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
 [Panting, smooching] 
 [Moaning] 
 [Both chuckle] 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 Ah... 
 Oh, come on. Just ignore it. 
 Mm, I can't ignore it. It could be a patient. 
 [Sighs] 
 Wow. 
 What? 
 Uh, well, either someone's sending you a vista of rolling hills or there are some serious boobs on your phone. 
 It's, um... It's a breast enhancement that I did a couple days ago. 
 Mm. Looks good. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Listen, I know it's strange that I get texts like this on my phone, but it's my job. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's my job. 
 Well, your job is weird and pervy. 
 No. This is purely clinical. 
 There's nothing titillating about this. 
 Okay... 
 No pun intended. 
 What are you doing? What... 
 No, it's fine. 
 No. I'm gonna text her back. Lookit. 
 Da-da-dun-dun. She's fine. It's done. Come here. 
 [Groans] 
 Come here. 
 Yeah, no. 
 Unfortunately, we're gonna have to take a rain check, doc. 
 Really? Why? 
 I don't know... just texts of swollen post-op breasts tend to really ruin the mood for me. 
 You're kidding. 
 Mm-hmm. Mm. 
 Tired anyway. I'm gonna go to sleep, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Sighs] 
 To be continued. 
 Mm. 
 So, what exactly did this Samantha woman say,  not your interpretation of what she said? 
 She said there was a hot redheaded woman at Daniel's place who was supposedly buying art and she seemed very comfortable there. 
 Well, maybe she'd been there before. 
 Maybe Daniel has a female client who likes to collect his pieces. 
 Or maybe he has a female client who likes to have s*x with him... 
 Which is why she's so damn comfortable. 
 Maybe. But it all comes down to whether you trust him or not. 
 That's the thing. I think a tiny part of me doesn't completely trust Daniel. 
 That's probably why I broke into his place. 
 I didn't find anything, but... 
 Back up. B-back up. Did you say you broke into his place? 
 In my defense, the door was unlocked. 
 When was this? 
 After you told me you saw him, you know, when he was supposed to be in Vermont, I got panicked he was lying, so I went to see if he was there, which he wasn't. 
 So, if you think about it, it's your fault I broke in. 
 Obviously. 
 But more importantly, this isn't a hypothetical conversation. 
 You clearly don't trust this man. 
 He's got nudes in his studio, Karen,  which means models were there... nude models. 
 Plus, he's always ignoring calls when I'm around and making "trips to Vermont." 
 For all I know, "Vermont" is code for "nude models." 
 Vermont may not even exist! 
 Why haven't you just asked him about this redheaded woman? 
 Because... I'm afraid. 
 Of what? 
 Of what the answer might be. 
 I mean, right now, things are going so well, and I don't want to ruin it by... 
 By hearing the truth? 
 Ignorance is bliss, right? 
 Besides, I don't know for a fact that he's sleeping with other women. 
 And you never will unless you ask him. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Sighs] Come in. 
 Savi : Hi. 
 Hey. 
 What happened to you last night? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I tried calling you a whole bunch of times, but it went straight to voicemail. 
 Well, my phone must have been turned off. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, uh, well, I was calling to tell you that... 
 [Sighs] my divorce is final. 
 All the paperwork is signed. 
 Where... where were you last night? 
 What? 
 Last night. What did you do? 
 Oh, uh, April came over. 
 We had some food, and that was pretty much it. 
 [Chuckles] Nothing too exciting. 
 Why? 
 That's all? 
 Yes. That is all. 
 [Chuckles] What's going on with you? 
 What's going on is that I don't like being lied to, Savi. 
 I saw you on 3rd street last night. 
 And you weren't with April. You were with some guy. 
 [Sighs] 
 And you two looked pretty friendly. 
 So stop lying to me, Savi. 
 Okay, let me explain. 
 No. Don't. Just... Don't, all right? Not here. 
 I-I understand that you're upset, but if you... 
 Get out of my office. 
 Now. 
 [Speed-dialing] 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Hey. What's up? 
 Hi. 
 Dom saw me with Zack last night. 
 We weren't doing anything. He just saw us on the street. 
 But then he caught me in a lie this morning when I told him I was having dinner with April. 
 So, I don't know. 
 This is just bad. I don't know what to do. What do I do? 
 Yeah, that's, uh... that's a bummer. 
 Did you just say, "that's a bummer"? 
 Uh, yep. 
 Listen, I can't really be having this conversation right now. 
 But for the record, I told you this might happen. 
 I know you did, and you were right. You were definitely right. 
 But that's not really helpful right now. 
 Just try to stay calm. We'll talk about it tonight, okay? 
 Bye. 
 Hmm. [Clears throat] 
 Okay, first of all... 
 What? 
 You're spending way too much on rentals. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, and second of all... 
 How's Savi? 
 Huh? 
 Oh. Um... She's fine. 
 Really need to let her know I'm moving back to Australia at some point. 
 Yeah, I'd hold off on that for a little while. 
 Stuff's just, um, really stressful at work for her. 
 You know what? Can we talk about me for a change? 
 "For a change"? 
 Yeah. 
 Um, so, I had a relationship first with Scott last night. 
 Okay, no, no, no, no, stop talking before it's too late and I can't un-hear it. 
 No, no, no, it's quite the opposite. 
 So, I slept over, and we didn't have s*x. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 Huh. 
 Well, good for you. 
 How is that good for me? 
 I know this is hard to believe, Joss, but maybe it means you are actually maturing. 
 Or maybe it means the entire relationship is over. 
 I rescind the part about maturing. 
 No, it's not even... I don't... [Sighs] 
 It's not even about the no-sex part, Harry. It's... it's about Scott. I mean, the guy's a plastic surgeon, right? 
 He makes boobs all day, and then he gets text messages of boobs all night. 
 It's... it's kind of gross. 
 Since when do you find boobs gross? You seemed to quite like them last year when you were a [Chuckles] lesbian. 
 Oh, really? Now who's immature here? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I just... I-I... [Sighs] 
 I don't know where this can go, Harry. 
 I just... I think he's kind of weird. 
 You're kind of weird. 
 Yeah, but I own being weird. It's... it's my thing, you know? Meanwhile, he pretends to be this straight-laced doctor, and he's got a closet full of lady shoes, and you don't even get to choose which ones you wear. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that bit. Look [Sighs] Joss, you seem to be generally happy lately, which might have something to do with this guy. I wouldn't do anything drastic if I were you. Okay. Do you see this? This, uh... this is why you can't go back to Australia. I need this Harry wisdom in my life. Yeah. Nice try. Still going. [Knock on door] [Caroline Smith's "The One Thing" plays softly] Hey, you. Come on in. [Smooches] [Chuckles] This is a nice surprise. Yeah, I closed the store early, and I thought I would just come by and say hi. Hi. ♪ Working from day until night ♪ 
♪ working from holding me to picking fights ♪ 
♪ fits of rage ♪ I have to ask you something. Sure. Go ahead. This may seem like it's coming out of nowhere. [Sighs] I wanted to know if you... ♪ Oh-oh, oh-oh ♪ wanted to take me to Vermont this weekend. Uh, Karen offered to watch Lucy, and I can use a break from the store. We can have a nice romantic getaway, just the two of us. You know what? Forget it. Never mind. Forget I even asked. No, no! No. Hey, hey. Hey. That sounds amazing, okay? I would love to take you, okay? [Sighs] Let's go book some flights, okay? ♪ Oh-oh-oh, oh ♪ [Inhales sharply, sighs] ♪ Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ [Sighs] [Sizzling] [Sighs] Smells amazing, Karen. I took a cooking class a few months ago. I'm really good at making three dishes. [Chuckles] So, how is your practice going? The practice? Uh, good. The new office mate, not so good. Oh, no. Why not? Uh, I don't want to go into specifics. Let's just say, uh... Cleanliness is not Dr. Rogers' top priority. [Chuckles] I miss having you next door. And not just because you shower. [Chuckles] So, um... [Popping lips] You seeing anyone these days? Um... Just a few dates here and there. Nothing serious. Ah. Aha. I see. [Chuckles] What about you? Uh, not really. No. Well, I've... I've been seeing someone for a few weeks, but I don't think it's gonna last. Why not? She's... she's a little young for me. Not much of a future in it. You know... The usual. [Sighs] [Bell dings] A dozen croissant rolls coming up. All right. Bring 'em on. [Indistinct conversations] Hi. Can we please talk? Look, I know how this must look to you, but I promise you it's not what you think. [Chuckling] Okay. H-how do you know what I think? Because I know what I would think. Zack and I are just friends, okay? There is absolutely nothing going on between us. Okay, so, uh, you have a new friend named Zack who you didn't tell me about, but I'm not supposed to think anything is strange? No, it's strange. It's just... A-and where exactly are you meeting all these new guy friends? I-I'm sorry. I'm not quite following the story. I didn't "meet" him. [Sighs] He found me. Dom, he's the guy that was in the other car... From the accident. The accident? W-what, your accident? He came to the open house a few weeks ago and explained who he was, so I-I invited him in and... Whoa, whoa, whoa, h-hold up. [Chuckling] Hold u... okay. I'm... I'm... I'm just trying to fully understand this. So, a guy that you got into a car crash with shows up at your front door... a guy who, for all you know, could hate you, c-could blame you for the accident, could be crazy... and you let him in? He's just... he's in a bad way, okay? The accident really screwed up his life. So, is he hitting you up for money yet? Is he planning on suing you bec... for the accident? This is insane, Savi. You're a lawyer. You should know better. I'm not naive, Dom, okay? I didn't trust him at first, either, but... I don't know... The more I got to know him, I realized he really is not here for anything. Okay. Okay, then. Well, uh, if you know him so well, maybe we should go out... all of us. What do you mean, "go out"? Well, if you trust him and like him so much  and he's your friend, maybe we should all be friends. Oh. Okay. Yeah. I'll ask him. Great. Great. Then we can, uh... We can all have lunch tomorrow then. Can't wait. [Sighs] Babe, how much salt did you put in there? Enough to make it taste good. Yeah? Because I can actually feel my heart rate spiking to unhealthy levels as we speak. Mm. What's the matter with you? You're so quiet tonight. Autumn : Dr. Scott? [Chuckling] Hi! It is you! Hey. Hello! Oh! Hey. [Chuckles] Uh, this is my girlfriend, Joss. Joss, this is, uh, Autumn. She's a patient of mine. Ah! Hmm. Oh, I can... I can see that. I know. Aren't they amazing? Your boyfriend is a genius. [Chuckles] Well, it's... [Sighs] So, what do you think? How do they look? This is the first time I've taken them out since the bandages came off. They look good. I'm just not sure if we should have gone a little bit bigger, and I think that the left one is a little smaller than the right one. Actually, would you mind feeling it and letting me know what you think? Oh. Um, see, the thing, I c... my hands... my hands are salty. Oh. Yeah. Um, but if you call the office, we can... we can make an appointment and get you all set. All right. I'll see you soon. [Chuckles] Nice to meet you. I am so sorry about that. Oh, no, no. You can't help it that you're a genius. [Crunches] Announcer : ... Comes a new definition of "terror." I am really loving your new place. How... how long have you been here now? About a year. You know, I-I actually, um... Stopped by to see you a couple times, but... I chickened out and didn't buzz. You did? Why not? I was a little nervous. [Chuckles] I mean, you can be kind of intimidating, Karen. Intimidating? [Chuckles] Yes, I can be very scary. I know. [Chuckles] So, why were you coming to see me? Um... Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you. I s... I said I-I didn't have any feelings left for you, and... I did. I do. You said no when I asked you out. I didn't know if I was ready to go down that road. But... but... Do you believe in signs? Not really. Neither do I, but running into you at that valet stand, I mean, that... That kind of felt like one. It kind of did. [Chuckles] [Sighs] ♪ Your religion's not in tune ♪ 
♪ sees the prophets talk to you ♪ 
♪ There's a light ♪ [Sighs] ♪ at the end of the hole ♪ [Exhales sharply] What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Everything is... is great. This doesn't seem great. I know. I'm sorry, Karen. I just... if we're... if we're really gonna do this, I just feel like I need to take care of my other dating situation first. Oh, okay. Um, uh... Thank you for... for dinner. It was excellent. Um, I will call you soon, okay? I... uh, very soon. [Door opens] [Exhales sharply] [Indistinct conversations] Savi : Zack, hey. Hey. Hi. I didn't know whether you liked lemonade or iced tea, so I got Arnold Palmers. Thank you. Uh, Zack. Uh, Dominic. Uh, so, Zack, I thought that you guys should meet in person so Dom could see in your eyes that there's no ulterior motives and no, you know, big, secret plot. [Chuckles] No, I-I get it. I-I just wanted to meet Savi and found an unlikely friend. That's all, man. [Chuckles] Okay. Well, um, so tell me something, man. Um... What would you think if you were sitting where I am... your girlfriend starts hanging out with some strange guy? That wouldn't bother you? I don't know, but I just told you nothing's going on, so... Maybe we should order some food or something harder. So, w-what made you decide to stalk Savi and go to her open house? Stalk? Uh, do I need to hire a lawyer here? 'Cause it kind of feels like I'm being cross-examined here. [Chuckles] I'm just making friendly conversation, you know, between friends. Look, I was just curious about Savi. I wanted to see how she was doing. I knew that she was the one person that could understand what I was going through. With the accident. -Yeah, I-I get it, Savi. Hey. No, no. Don't talk to her like that. [Sighs] [Chuckles] All right, look. Savi might not see what's going on here, but I do. You're a guy. You're not looking to make a new friend. You either want money, or you want Savi. Okay. You know what, Dom? That's enough. I don't see him denying anything. When we first starting hanging out, we were just friends. "Were." We are just friends. Yeah, but you want more. I don't know. Maybe. The more time we spend together, the more I realize that we have a connection. I-I don't know if you felt it. Maybe you... maybe... maybe you haven't. No, no, no. D-Dom, I'm... I'm... I had no idea of this, okay? You know what? I don't really care who knew what when. All right? I'm out of here. [Sighs] I didn't mean it to go like that. Don't. I'm sorry, all right? I didn't plan... [Sighs] It's fantastic. Really? You're not just saying that. No, it'll look perfect in your storefront window. What? No, I've never put something I've made in my front window. I don't see why you wouldn't. This piece is better than anything else you got in the store. [Inhales deeply] This is all because of you, you know? I wasn't working on anything until you came into my life. You've really inspired me. Aww. You've done the same for me. Mm. Well, maybe we could have a show together. Mm? [Chuckles] I forgot. Uh, bad news. We can't go to Vermont this weekend. Why? Uh, termite infestation, so we had to tent. But I did book us a trip to Big Bear, you know, so we can still go away. [Stomps foot] [Sighs] What is it? You're lying. I know you're lying. What? My friend saw you out when you were supposed to be in Vermont a few weeks ago. Please don't lie to me again, because I just may lose it on you right here. Okay. Okay. Truth is... I don't have a house in Vermont, okay? Not anymore. The story I told you, it... it was true, about my mom, but I sold it a few years ago. I don't care about the damn house! I want to know where you go when you keep telling me you're there! My friend saw a redheaded woman at your place the other day. Are you sleeping with her? Just tell me the truth! Just be honest with me, Daniel! Are there other women? Just that one. She's... My wife. [Gasps] He just stopped mid-kiss out of respect for you? For me or for the girl, who is apparently much younger than me, which is why I'm calling her "a girl." Oh, no, no, honey. It was definitely for you. You guys are perfect for each other. You're both shrinks. You're gorge, and he's tall, dark, and chinny. Men generally don't dump young women for older women. They dump young women for younger women. I really don't like younger women. Me, neither, specifically ones who ask your boyfriend to feel them up in the movie theater. It's a long story. Actually, that's the whole story. 
 
 Ring, damn it. Karen, stop! Okay. Stop. He's gonna call. Sometimes, it just takes a couple days to dump somebody. Unless it's not about her. Hmm? [Sighs] Maybe when he kissed me, everything that happened last year just came flooding back to him. Now you're just being paranoid. This wasn't some date with a guy that googled you. This was Jacob. Uh, he's your friend. He knew exactly what he was getting into when he asked you out. Just give the guy some credit, okay? [Cellphone chimes] See? [Cellphone chimes] It's April. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Uh-oh. [Voice breaking] How can this happen again? [Sighs] I mean, is it me? Do I only attract dishonest men? [Sighs] I'm such an idiot. No, you are not an idiot. You've just... you've just had bad luck with two guys. Yeah, two out of three. [Sighs] So, how did you two leave it? How do you think she left it, right? I mean, he's married. I told him to go, and he did. And that was it. You didn't even hear his side of the story? [Scoffs] What side? There is no side. Plus, I knew that if he started talking, I would let him convince me. Oh, sweetie, you did the right thing. I know it must have been really hard, but you did do the right thing. I just feel bad... for both of you. Why do you feel bad for him? Yeah. Why? Because I saw the way he looked at you. Even if he is married, I could see he really cared about you. And I know you cared about him, too. I think I really loved him. Well [Sighs] maybe... maybe you guys can figure something out, you know? [Sighs] How? He's married. Well, I-I know. You were married. And now you're not, you know? Things happen. I think it's silly for any of us to get all moral-high-groundy, considering our track records. No, no, I'm not talking about us. I'm talking about April. She's a saint. [Chuckles] Even saints are allowed to feel sad. [Whimpers] [Sobs] [Sobbing] I tried calling a few times, but you didn't answer. Zack, what are you doing here? You can't just show up whenever you want to, especially now. I just needed to talk to you. I wanted to apologize. Yeah, how could you do that to me? You knew why I wanted you to meet Dom, okay? I-I just... I... [Chuckles] I don't understand what happened. Neither do I, but everything I said was true. You put me in a terrible position. And I feel bad about that. But I'm not going to pretend that this was all in my head. It wasn't just me in this relationship, Savi. We are not in a relationship, Zack. [Sighs] And I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea. I... Why didn't you tell Dom about me? [Sighs] Okay, there's no point in discussing this. I have to concentrate on my relationship with Dom. I'm sorry. [Door closes] [TV chatter] [Door opens, closes] Scott: Hey. [Sighs] You do realize that you're hours late, right? "Hours" with an "s"... plural. I know. [Scoffs] Well, okay. I told Michelle and Ben to just go ahead and eat so they wouldn't lose the table, but I'm sure they're probably home by now, anyway, so... Joss, I-I'm sorry. You want me to take you somewhere else? No. No, I've... I already had a box of chips ahoy and started "The Bachelorette." I don't think I could take much more excitement. We'll just do it another night. [TV turns off] You know what? Just... Why exactly couldn't you call me? Don't use the doctor excuse, because I've seen medical dramas, and... McSqueamy or whoever is always stepping out of the O.R. to call somebody, so... You don't think you're overreacting maybe just a little bit? No, I just... I don't understand, Scott. It's not like you perform open-heart surgery. What was so important that you couldn't take two seconds  and just call me? You really want to know? Yeah, Scott! Yeah? Okay, no, you're right. I wasn't doing open-heart surgery. I'm not a heart surgeon. I was doing a regular old rhinoplasty. Something I've probably done 1,000 times in my life, and everything was going perfectly fine until she didn't wake up from her anaesthesia. So, she died right there in recovery. She's 22 years old, and she's dead. What? Oh, my God. Scott, I'm s... Yeah, so now I-I'm on the phone, right? I've got to call her parents, right? I got to explain to them why their daughter died getting a nose job. I got to try to make sense out of something that doesn't make any sense at all, so I am so sorry that I'm late. And I'm sorry that I don't feel like eating sushi tonight with our friends, honey, but I had a really crappy day, and this... this isn't helping. [Sighs] [Door slams] [Sighs] [Bell jingles] One minute. That's all you get. Thank you. Don't thank me. I don't even know why you're here. I'm here to apologize. For being married? Apology not accepted. No, for not being honest. But in my defense, I-I never expected any of this to happen. It wasn't ever a part of the plan. What was the plan? You were gonna just sleep with me until you got bored, a-and that would be that? No, no. Okay, of course not, okay? It's just... Uh, what happened with us, I-I-I-it's not something that I do. Okay? It's not something that I've... I've ever done, and...   and... and... and I've... I-I've been tortured about it. Oh, now I'm supposed to feel bad for you. No. I just... I want you to understand that it was real. Okay? What we had... It was real. ♪ I can hold my breath ♪ And I love you. I think I may always love you.

Oh, my God. [Sighs] Yeah. What were you thinking? I don't know, Harry. I was thinking I just wanted to escape before he came out of the bathroom and told me what a bitch I was. [Exhales sharply] Right. Yeah. As logical as that is, did you ever consider any other possibilities? [Sighs] Like what? Oh, geez, I don't know... off the top of my head, how about not leaving and having an adult conversation? Yeah, no. Not so much. [Chuckles] Not for a second. Harry, can you please stop signing those papers? We're in the middle of a crisis here. Come on. I don't understand what's going on with you lately. The other day, you kept babbling on about how you weren't sure if you were right for each other, and now you're in a crisis because you had a fight. You're all over the place. What? What... I'm babbling? Really? You're acting very odd when it comes to this guy, even for you. Really? You think that I'm acting odd? Harry, you don't think that it's odd that these women text him photos of their breasts and ask him to feel them up and, clearly, all of his patients are in love with him? It pisses me off! Aha! What? [Snaps fingers] Elementary, my dear Joss. You... are jealous. Oh, puh-lease. Harry, I don't get jealous. [Chuckles] Well, clearly, you don't like having to fight for Scott's attention. That is jealousy. I mean, you... you get this pit in your stomach when you think about it, right? Huh? Yes? This is a good thing, Joss. It means you care about him. Okay, stop it. Even if you're right, which I am not saying that you are, how is this good? I screwed it all up, Harry. He told me that his patient died, and I left while he was in the shower. Yeah, that part's not great. You should probably try to fix that. Unless it's already too late. [Knock on door] Hi. Hey. I'm really glad you're here. I know this is not the point, but I, uh... I told Zack that we can't be friends anymore. You're right. Uh, that's not the point. No, the point is that, uh... [Chuckles] You had all this stuff going on with you and I had no idea. Sweetie... T-there was nothing going on. Obviously, something was going on, or you wouldn't have made a new best friend without telling me. [Sighs] You know where I was the night that I saw you two? I was at a jewelry store buying you a gift to t-tell you that... I was ready to have a baby. [Sighs] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm not... I'm not... I'm not trying to... t-to make you feel bad. I'm just trying to explain. Look, we are supposed to be in this relationship together. We are. But we're not. I mean, y-you're over there in one relationship, and I'm all the way over here thinking it's something else entirely. Dom, that's not true. I don't think that we're as far apart as you think that we are. [Sighs] Just because Zack has feelings for me... No, no. Don't... don't go there, because t-that's... that's not it. That's... Look, I-I may not like Zack or his feelings, but I-I get them. [Chuckles] I-I-I get why he was in this with you. Okay, I-I understand that you're mad that I didn't tell you, but I... No, but that's not even it, Savannah. D... Let's pretend I understood you keeping it a secret. I mean, l-let's pretend that I could get over that part for now. I still don't understand why. What were you getting from him that you couldn't get from me? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Then what was it about?! W-w-w-w-what did you want from him? There must... There must be some reason why you were keeping him in your life. I-I don't... I don't know, Dom. I don't know, okay? Yeah, well... You need to figure that out. You need to take some time and think... Alone. And until you get it clear in your head... let's call it a break. [Door closes] [Sighs] [Telephone ringing] [Telephone beeps] Hello. Oh. Come on up. [Telephone beeps] [Sighs] [Sighs] [Knock on door] [Clears throat] So... I broke up with her. [Both sigh] [Gasps] [Both chuckle] Joss : [Chuckles] Hey, you're pretty good. Well, it's a lot easier when no one's actually guarding you. [Sighs] I'm sorry about your patient. And... and I'm... [Exhales sharply] Really sorry that I disappeared. I... [Sighs] It was immature, and it was wrong. And I just... I panicked, and I couldn't process, and... I handled it all really horribly. I'm sorry. Well, I'm not gonna argue that with you. Ouch. Although... I mean, I guess if we're being fair, you know, how could you have known, right? I didn't... And... You're right. I'm not a cardiac surgeon. Oh, God, I never should have said that! Obviously, what you do is amazing. It's not amazing. [Chuckles] Yes, it is. No, it's not, and to tell you the truth, I'm not always proud of what I do for a living. What? Wow. That's the first time I've ever said that out loud. Hey, you don't need to be so hard on yourself. Yeah, I do. It's... it's what inspires me to go to these third-world countries, you know... do things that actually make a difference, that actually mean something. [Chuckles] 'Cause let's face it, what I do here is... [Sighs] Is kind of douchey. Hey, I really wish that you wouldn't talk about my boyfriend in that tone, okay? Because what he does makes people happy, mister. And what's more important than that? It's kind of like, you know, what I do as a party planner. Yeah, no, I never thought about it. It's like we have the same job. [Chuckles] That's exactly what I was saying. [Laughs] Mm. You know what? It turns out I wasn't even mad at you for being late. I was actually jealous of all of these women that think that you walk on water. Wait a minute. You're jealous? Yeah, I know. First time. Ladies and gentlemen, she is jealous. I know! Stop! First time. What are we gonna do? I don't want to talk about it. You know what? Let's just clear this up, okay? You have nothing to be jealous of... Because I am 100%... Massively... actually, annoyingly... Done with me? in love with you. What? And, um... I think you should move in with me. [Chuckles] Wait, did you just... did you just ask me to move in with you? Yeah. Yeah, I kind of did. Uh... Well, think about it. You're gonna need a place to stay soon, right? And I want to spend as much time with you as I possibly can. Uh-huh. Two birds, one stone. What do you think? [Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah? Uh... Okay. Come here. Let's do it. [Chuckles] Mm. I missed you. I missed you, too. [Chuckling] Yes! I had to do it! See you at home. [Laughs] [Indistinct conversations] Hey. Thanks for coming to meet me. Oh, no, sure! I needed an excuse to get out of the house. Right. [Clears throat] [Sighs] So, is there a m... Would you like a drink? Menu? [Chuckles] I don't even know why I asked that. I'm not even hungry. [Sighs] So, yeah, um... [Sighs] There's something I need to tell you, and I just... I thought I should do it in person. Okay. What is it? It's [Chuckles] nothing bad. I, uh... I'm moving back to Australia. What? It probably seems a bit sudden, but I've been thinking about it for a while, to be honest. And an opportunity has presented itself, so I figured... Why not now? So, is this happening soon? Well, I'm not leaving for a few weeks. I'd like to be here until the house sale is taken care of, but... Even if I'm gone, you can always reach me, right? Yeah. Okay. You all right? [Sighs] No. No. I'm not. I really made a mess of things, didn't it? [Sighs] I don't know, Sav. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Yeah, maybe. Just, uh... Right now, having... A hard time seeing what that reason might be. [Sighs] [Door opens] April. I wasn't sure if you'd be here. I thought that if you weren't here, it would be a sign, but... You are. You're here. You want to talk? Not really. [Voice breaking] I just need to be with you right now. Can I just be with you? [Sobbing] Hey, hey, hey. We are definitely doing that again. Definitely. A lot. [Both chuckle] Hey. Is it okay if I take a shower? Of course. There are towels in the closet on the left. Got it. [Cellphone ringing, vibrating] Your phone's ringing! [Sighs] Sorry. Just ignore it. It's... it's the girl. She programmed her own ringtone, which I now need to get rid of. [Ringing, vibrating continue] [Water running] [Sighs] [Sighs]
