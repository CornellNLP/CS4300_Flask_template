 Perhaps this may continue over a nightcap. 
 Previously on "Mistresses"... 
 No. Merci. 
 You want to see Lucy? This is all you get. 
 When I'm done, you're done. 
 You can't ask me to be your shoulder to cry on when you're upset, and then get pissed when I try to help. 
 Elizabeth is the one who killed Tom, and now she's saying I'm responsible? 
 Why didn't you at least warn me? 
 I took myself off the case. 
 I was alone the night your father died. 
 You need an alibi. Use me. 
 I'd do anything for you, Karen. 
 My name is Dr. Karen Kim. 
 I have been a psychiatrist for over 15 years. 
 I established my current practice with Dr. Jacob Pollack five years ago. 
 [Woman] And when did you first start seeing Thomas Grey? 
 About three years ago. 
 And what was the reason? 
 He had severe insomnia. 
 For which you prescribed medication? 
 Yes. 
 Morphine? 
 No. 
 The morphine was... 
 Stop. Karen... 
 We've been through this. 
 Morphine comes up, you plead the fifth. 
 But Elizabeth's lawyers will have pharmacy records. 
 If you don't talk about it, they can't contradict your notes or prior statements. 
 If you don't contradict yourself, you protect your credibility. 
 Prescribing morphine for pain management isn't a crime. 
 Assisting in suicide is a whole other matter. [Cell phone buzzes] 
 [Buzz] 
 Morphine comes up, you plead the fifth. 
 Affair comes up, you plead the fifth. 
 Specific dates come up, you don't know or you don't recall. 
 How does that not look ridiculously suspicious? 
 To whom? There's no jury. 
 And the Judge enters the process long after we're done. 
 He'll review the depositions and decide if it will go to trial. 
 If you don't want that to happen, the less you say, the better. 
 How are we doing on your alibi for the night Thomas died? 
 Well... that's disappointing. 
 I have one. 
 Sam Grey. 
 Elizabeth Grey's son? 
 That Sam Grey? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, that Sam Grey. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey. Thanks for coming. 
 [Sighs] 
 What do you want? 
 To say my good-byes. 
 My flight's on Thursday. 
 It's the earliest I could afford. 
 Good, then. 
 Going back to Florida? 
 Yeah. 
 I also wanted to thank you for showing me the photos of Lucy. 
 It was more than I deserve. 
 Um... 
 Can you give this to her for me? 
 A locket? 
 There are pictures of me and Lucy inside... 
 The last Christmas we had before I made the biggest mistake of my life. 
 Just tell her, I don't know, that you found it in my stuff. 
 I really want her to have it. Please. I'm getting on a plane, April. 
 I'm out of your life. I'm just asking for a small way to be with Lucy... 
 To stay close to her heart. 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 You've never stopped being close to her heart. 
 [Door opens] [Door closes] 
 [Knocks] 
 You summoned? 
 Yes. 
 So how's it going with our New York friends? 
 Oh, you know New Yorkers. They're picky and opinionated. 
 They refuse to like anything, but I'll get 'em. 
 Uh, tell me what you think of this. 
 Viens ici. Quoi? 
 I promise I won't bite. 
 [Laughs] 
 A mid century modern in the heart of the Hollywood Hills. 
 I believe it'd be perfect for them. 
 Yeah. It's, uh, it's beautiful. 
 Mm. It becomes even more stunning the longer you look at it. 
 Uh, actually, I... 
 I just remembered I have to be somewhere, so, um, let's, uh, let's talk later. 
 D'accord. 
 [Woman] All right. I'll see you later. 
 [Bells on door jingle] 
 Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. 
 Hi. Could I have an iced coffee? Uh, lots of ice. 
 Like, way more ice than you think the normal person would take. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh. 
 Feeling hot? 
 And bothered. 
 Why is it that my boss is interested in me now? 
 Because I'm not available. That's why. 
 [Sighs] Hey. Whoa. Karen, are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I just had a long morning prepping for my deposition, and... 
 Oh... [inhales sharply] That's right, that's coming up. 
 Are you and Savi gonna battle it out in court? 
 What if she objects, and then you're all, "Savi, I wasn't finished". 
 And then the whole court finds out that you're best friends, and then the Judge is like, "holy crap, this is a mistrial" and she puts you in jail? 
 Oh, my God. That probably wouldn't happen. I'm sorry. 
 It's not a trial. It's a deposition. 
 And Savi won't be there because she's off the case. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So Paul's finally leaving. 
 Oh, hallelujah. 
 That's great. 
 Is it really, though? I mean, great? 
 What are you talking about? Of course it is. 
 Then why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong? 
 I mean, keeping Paul away from Lucy... is it really my place to make this decision? 
 [People speaking indistinctly] 
 Where's Savi? 
 Oh, she had a meeting. Hey. Wow. We're still here. We can help. 
 I know. It's just, you're a little high-strung, and you're a bit analytical. 
 I'm looking for a gut reaction here. 
 Do I tell Lucy about Paul? 
 [Both] No! 
 No need to yell. 
 I just don't understand why you're suddenly questioning your decision. 
 You're her mother... 
 And he's her father. 
 Who she thinks is dead, April. 
 But he's not, which means Lucy could potentially grow up with a father instead of without one. 
 A lying dirt bag of a father, but a father nonetheless. 
 A child Lucy's age is too young to process this. 
 So you think it's okay to play God with my daughter's life? 
 A parent's job till they're 18. 
 At which point, you revisit. 
 So I have at least eight years until I have to make this decision. 
 And who knows? By then, he might be dead again anyway. 
 [Mouth full] What? 
 Seriously, what? 
 [Sighs] Can I get a double espresso? 
 So you don't need anything else for the Grey depos, do you? 
 Stop fishing, Savannah. 
 I am not fishing. 
 Uh-huh. [Clears throat] 
 What's this? 
 A diversion. 
 A trip to New York? 
 Yeah, there are some issues with some of the Kellerman assets, which, as you know, reside in First Monument Bank so, our East Coast partners are looking forward to your arrival. 
 That is a huge client, Dom. Why are you giving me this? 
 Because I can't do this depo with your nose pressed up against the glass. 
 Karen Kim is my friend. 
 I know. 
 Which is why I don't want you here to see her get hurt. 
 You really think she might lose? 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, you're just gonna love Stacey. 
 [Mouth full] Yeah? 
 We've been friends since elementary school, and then she moved to New York to be a dancer, but ended up falling in love with some Wall Street guy. 
 Oh, she's straight? 
 Yes, and so are Charlie and Emma. 
 Are you gonna invite any of your couple friends? 
 [Normal voice] Sure. 
 Except I don't have any. 
 Well, I can invite Chad and Dara. 
 Awesome. 
 I was hoping that we could use Savi's place. 
 Savi? My sister Savi? 
 Yeah. This place isn't really big enough for entertaining, and we wouldn't be able to be outside, and... 
 But I don't want it to be a problem. Will it be a problem? 
 No, no, no, no. It's not a problem. I'll ask her. 
 Okay. 
 [ Katie Herzog ] ♪ I've got a little secret, too. 
 Do you miss that? 
 Who, him? 
 [Mouth full] Look, I know... 
 [Normal voice] That you can't just turn off your sexual attraction to men. 
 Honestly, yes. 
 It's a little weird not knowing the next time I'm gonna see a naked guy, and, yes, sometimes I miss it. 
 But I feel like it's like becoming a Vegan, not being able to eat meat. 
 Your body just goes into shock for a little bit. 
 So is that something you're feeling lately? Is your body craving, um... 
 Do you feel it... it needs a, mm... 
 Like, a sausage or... 
 [Chuckles] 
 A hot dog or something? 
 Would it be okay if I was? 
 I don't know. 
 I feel like we're still trying to figure so much stuff out and... 
 You know, boundaries and stuff. 
 Well, how does it work in lesbian land when someone sleeps with a guy? 
 Well, there's not exactly a rule book, but I don't know, I mean, if it were to happen, hypothetically, I guess... 
 It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. 
 No? 
 I mean, no. 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Hypothetically. 
 Right. 
 I mean, Annette Bening took back Julianne Moore when she slept with Mark Ruffalo, and they had kids together. 
 I don't know who any of those people are. 
 Alex, oh. 
 We have to start using on demand more. You're killing me. 
 I have to teach a class in 15 minutes. 
 And you have to ask Savi about Monday. 
 Yes. Yes. Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. [Door closes] 
 [Bells on door jingle] 
 Hey. 
 I take it you didn't come here for vanilla-scented candles. 
 No, no. I'm good on candles. 
 But we should probably talk about Six Flags. 
 [Jingles] 
 The Amusement Park. Right. We're supposed to take the girls on Monday. 
 But we made those plans before we... 
 Right. 
 Which kind of... changes things. 
 Yeah, I don't know. Uh, we could cancel. 
 But Madi's been talking about it nonstop. She's really excited to go with Lucy. 
 I know. Lucy feels the same way. 
 She'll be crushed if we didn't go. 
 We could just do it. Kids come first, right? 
 Yeah, we... we can spend the day together and then, tell the girls about us some other time. 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Anyway, you seem to like the candle. So you can just take it. 
 I'll see you on... on Monday. 
 Okay. Uh... 
 I'll see you next week. 
 [Josslyn] Are you sure you're cool with me and Alex using the house? 
 Yeah, of course. [Huffs] A couples' dinner? 
 You've become so domestic now that you're a lesbian. 
 Oh, hilarious. 
 It'll only be a few people, though. Alex asked me to invite some couple friends, and then I realized that I don't have any anymore... 
 Unless you and Harry want to come. 
 Uh, no. I don't think that'll be happening. 
 You never know until you ask. 
 Harry won't come. Dom, on the other hand... 
 Um, Dom, on the other hand, what? 
 [Sighs] 
 Hmm? 
 Nothing. 
 [Sighs] 
 Did he say something to you? 
 He did, didn't he? 
 He told you he was into you. I knew I should've warned you. 
 What, did you talk to him? When did you talk to him? 
 Please. Does he realize you're still married to Harry? 
 Do you? 
 [Sighs] Of course I do. 
 It's just, Harry won't even talk to me. 
 I don't know where he is or what he's thinking. 
 He's thinking that he loves you, Savi. 
 He can't get over what I did. 
 And I can't make him. 
 So you immediately run into the arms of another man? 
 I'm not running into anyone's arms right now. I'm just... 
 Trying to stay realistic. 
 [Dominic] A few points of procedure before we begin. 
 This is not a trial. 
 These depositions are simply to gather evidence. 
 This evidence can be used if the case ever does go to trial. 
 So remember, you're still under oath. 
 Anyone who testifies is bound to tell the truth. 
 Ms. Wade, anything else? 
 That about covers it. 
 Let's just try to keep things civil. 
 Couldn't agree more. [ Intercom beeps ] 
 Bringing in our first witness. 
 [Man] Yes, Sir. 
 [Whispers] Here we go. 
 [Dominic] Could you please state your name for the record? 
 Anthony Newsome. 
 And in your investigative work for Huxley Insurance, did you discover anything about Mr. Grey's state of mind near the time of his death? 
 Well, the first time I spoke with Dr. Kim about the case, she informed that, uh, Thomas Grey was not suicidal or depressed at all. 
 The first time? 
 Yeah, I was able to question her again after an interview with one of the hospice nurses raised a red flag. 
 That's when she turned in her notes. 
 Why then? 
 I informed her that this case could easily turn into a criminal investigation. 
 And was that true? 
 No, uh, not entirely, but, uh, I felt I had no choice. 
 My employer was demanding to see those notes. 
 What did you find in the notes? 
 The exact opposite of what she had originally told me. 
 Uh, the notes claimed that Thomas Grey was suicidal and depressed. 
 Thank you, Mr. Newsome. 
 Ms. Wade. 
 Mr. Newsome. 
 Mm. 
 Is it possible that you're only here out of spite? 
 Excuse me? 
 Are you here because Dr. Kim rejected your romantic advances, and you decided to get back at her? 
 Ms. Wade, what the hell is this? 
 Uh, that's not true at all. 
 I showed up at Dr. Kim's house one evening to help her install a Security Camera. That's about it. 
 But you wanted to get physical? 
 Please stop. 
 [Dominic] I don't think this is relevant. 
 If Mr. Newsome has a personal grudge towards my client, I think it is. 
 We'll agree to disagree. 
 Thank you, Mr. Newsome. 
 [Indistinct screaming] 
 [Madi] I can't wait to go on that. 
 [Lucy] I think we should go here first. 
 Oh, and then all the way back this way until we get here. 
 We should go on this one twice. 
 And that one last. 
 [April] Okay, okay. 
 Hold on, girls. I know you're excited, but we have to go over some rules first. 
 No running off ahead of us. 
 We have to be able to see you at all times. 
 Always stay together. 
 Ice cream and candy after we eat... 
 After lunch. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh! Wait up. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you so much for taking us here. 
 My mom took me to Disneyland once, but I don't even remember it. 
 Oh, you're welcome, Madi. 
 She really likes you. 
 I like her, too. 
 So... 
 Do you have any sort of plan in mind when it comes to my sister? 
 [Laughs] 
 I really hope that's not why you wanted to talk because, it's not your business, now is it? 
 Yeah, actually, it is my business because right now, I'm the one trying to save this marriage. 
 So if... if you don't want that, you need to let me know. 
 [Cash register bell dings] 
 There's nothing to save, Joss. Not anymore. 
 Why? Why not anymore? 
 Because Savi must have received the paternity results. 
 And since I haven't heard a single word from her and saw that... 
 b*st*rd at our house, I can only assume that the baby is not mine. 
 Well, I can tell you that that is 100% not true. 
 So what, you're saying that she hasn't received the results yet? 
 No, no, she has, but she hasn't opened them, she gave me the envelope instead. 
 So... 
 Uh, no, I... 
 I haven't opened them either, so... 
 So what, she's not planning to ever read them? 
 I have no idea. You know Savi. She's weird. 
 She has her own way of doing everything. But is this all really about the kid? 
 Yes. 
 Then call Genzide and make them tell you the results. 
 Joss, if you have them... 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Honey, as much as I'm rooting for you, kiddo, I can't betray the sisterhood. 
 There are codes. 
 Now, Josslyn... 
 Codes. Harry, stop. 
 Listen, you have a sexy accent and the baby blues. 
 So walk into Genzide and make the clerk tell you the information. 
 And if the kid's not yours, you can... you can get a divorce. 
 Fine, if that's what you want. 
 But, Harry, if that baby's yours, and you don't step up, you could lose everything. 
 [Indistinct screaming] 
 They're still playing. 
 So how come you don't talk about her, your ex? 
 Uh... 
 I don't know. 
 Why do you bring it up? 
 Oh, it's... it's actually been on my mind for a while. 
 I was just waiting for the right time to bring it up. 
 Oh well, we broke up. I'm covered in Churro dust, it's obviously the perfect time. 
 You're right. You don't have to tell me. 
 It's none of my business, and the girls will be here any second. 
 But for the record, you pretty much know everything about my life, and I know nothing about yours. 
 It seems kind of lopsided. 
 I mean, I don't even know this woman's name. 
 It's Sandra. 
 I don't like talking about it because it's kind of embarrassing. 
 More embarrassing then having your husband fake his own death because he impregnated another woman? 
 No. [Chuckles] 
 She just left me for another guy and moved to Chicago with him. 
 She sees Madi when she can, which is less and less. 
 It's not as dramatic as your story, but it still just kind of sucks. 
 I'm sorry, Richard. Really. 
 Don't be. It's okay. 
 Madi and I have built a good life together. 
 We've adjusted. 
 You've done a really good job with her. I mean, you're a terrific dad. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Alex, it's me. I really wish you'd pick up, because I have no idea what I'm looking at here, and I don't know what you want. 
 These... these aren't real ice cream flavors. 
 I think it's... does that say "Olive Martini"? 
 "Dehydrated bourbon"? 
 "Lemongrass soufflé"? 
 I... "Coconut breast milk"? What is this? 
 Uh, horseradish prince. 
 Okay. That's just Come on. You know what? 
 Do you have some chocolate chip or something? 
 Chocolate chip? No. 
 Can you just check in the back? 
 They don't have chocolate chip what ice cream place doesn't have chocolate chip? 
 Is this some kind of practical joke or something? 
 Because there's an ice cream store, like, a block away from your house. 
 Instead, I'm looking at... Hi. I'm so sorry. Excuse me. 
 I'm... I'm looking at something called, what is that, "chocolate-covered bacon"? 
 Do you like the bacon? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I really, I don't think that I should be in charge of food shopping. 
 I'm not good at it. I'm a better restaurant picker outer. 
 [Call waiting beeps] 
 Oh, God. 
 That's work. If you get this in the next five minutes, please call me back. 
 
 
 
 Hello. 
 Hello, Josslyn. Ça va? 
 I'm super-duper. What can I do for you, Olivier? 
 Are you familiar with the property on Clark Drive? 
 Um, Greg's listing? 
 Yes. But Greg is unfortunately sick. 
 I think he ate some bad crab. 
 Would you be able to show the listing to a couple that was planning on meeting Greg there tonight at 7:00? 
 Oh, um... 
 Unless you are busy. I know you are not working today. 
 Uh, no. It... it's fine. 
 I... no problem. I'll be there. 
 Parfait. Je te remercie. 
 I'll make it up to you. 
 Okay, bye. 
 You know what? Just cancel the... the bacon. You don't even care. 
 It's... [sighs] Thank you. 
 Hey, Alex. It's me again. Bad news. 
 My husband was a pillar of this community. 
 People looked up to him. 
 He was too proud a man to take his own life. 
 So how do you explain his asking for morphine? 
 Tom was in a lot of pain. 
 He wanted to live out the rest of his life as joyfully as he could. 
 Dr. Kim clearly lied about his mental state. 
 Objection. 
 Noted. Continue, Mrs. Grey. 
 Well... 
 Once I discovered that Dr. Kim had prescribed him the morphine. 
 I started to question things. 
 Based on what exactly? 
 Call it a wife's intuition. 
 I suspected, but had no proof, how far their relationship went. 
 Until Tom told me they were having an affair. 
 [Wade] Is your client planning to say anything based on fact? 
 She's answering the questions to the best of her ability. 
 So he told you about the affair? 
 He was confessing a mistake. 
 He was concerned that Dr. Kim had mistaken a night or two for something more. 
 That she was becoming irrational and demanding things from him. 
 That is a lie. 
 She was angry that he didn't return her feelings. 
 [Wade] You were the angry one, weren't you, Mrs. Grey? 
 Understandably, if you thought your husband and Dr. Kim were sleeping together. 
 [Voice breaking] My beloved husband was dying. 
 Weeping with apology... 
 And professing his love for me and our 20-year marriage. 
 There was no time for anger. 
 At least not toward him. 
 What does this have to do with your baseless accusations? 
 He was too weak to administer the morphine himself. 
 Perhaps Dr. Kim came over that night to help. 
 [Huffs] She's lying. 
 [Voice breaking] Elizabeth, you told me that Tom called out for the morphine. 
 And you gave it to him that night. 
 That's impossible. 
 I wasn't even home when Tom died that night. 
 I was out when it happened. 
 You were out? 
 With my son. 
 Next witness for my client will be Samuel Grey. 
 [Car horns] 
 [Dominic] So, Sam, how often did you see your father toward the end of his life? 
 I would come home on weekends to visit my dad when I could. 
 Especially that last month. 
 No one really knew when it was gonna happen, just that it was going to. 
 I mean, one doctor had given him four months. 
 One had given him a year. So I tried to visit as much as possible. 
 And the weekend he did pass away? 
 I actually came home just as much for my mom as for my dad. 
 She was... 
 A mess she hadn't slept in weeks, she'd barely eaten. 
 Spending all her time taking care of him. 
 But my dad was awake that night. 
 It was actually his idea. 
 [Dominic] What was his idea? 
 That I take my mom out for dinner. 
 Even after she had dismissed the night nurse? 
 Yeah. 
 Dad was resting pretty comfortably, and he... 
 He thought it would be nice if I got her out of the house for an hour. 
 He seemed okay. 
 I mean... if... if I'd have known... 
 Anyway, yeah, um, we were out for, about an hour, and when we got back... 
 He was gone. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But that's the way it happened. 
 [Jangles keys] 
 [Trills lips and exhales] 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh. 
 What are you, some kind of French ninja? 
 I didn't mean to startle you. I merely came by to check in. 
 It seems I have missed the clients. 
 Yeah, they left about ten minutes ago. 
 That's too bad. 
 Mm. 
 Do you normally stop by and check on agents while they're showing houses? 
 Oh, it's not a rule. 
 But there are certain people for whom I break the rules. 
 So do you think you have a sale? 
 I'm, uh... 
 Pretty confident I can close the deal. 
 Are you? 
 Confident? 
 Shall I give you the tour? 
 I like that idea.

Think there's anyway we can un-break up right now? Funny. I was just about to ask the same thing. Really? I think you should tell Lucy the truth about Paul. You what? I know it's a bit of a 180 from the fistfight, and considering we just got back together five seconds go, I may have jumped the gun. So what, you don't hate him anymore? Oh, no. I hate him. I hate him a lot. But you wouldn't be doing this for him. I'm not even sure it would be the best thing for Lucy right now, but I think it would be the best thing for you. I don't understand. You and Lucy have an amazing relationship. It's a gift, really. I just don't think that you should keep something this important from her. And even if you should, I don't know if you could. I don't see how you lie to her face every day for the rest of her life. It's not in you, April. It's not who you are. Even if I'm doing it to protect her? She's gonna freak out when you tell her, definitely. But if she finds out a different way, if Paul just shows up one day... She'll never forgive you. And she will never, ever trust you again. Do you really want to take that chance? [Inhales deeply] Wow. [Bell dings] [People speaking indistinctly] [Doors close] Okay, not the best end of day for us. Not the best end of day? I was basically accused of boiling a bunny and murdering Tom. I can refute anything they brought up. All you need to do is find a new alibi for that night by tomorrow. And they can't prove a thing. Why can't I just tell the truth? Claiming to be home alone is technically the worst alibi of all time. I know this makes you uncomfortable, but it needs to be done. Ask your partner. He's in love with you. He testifies tomorrow. Jacob's not in love with me. And I can't ask him, of all people, to lie under oath. [Ding] Take my advice and a week from now, this whole thing will be a distant memory. [Ding] Karen. Great performance. Karen, wait. Get away from me. Please hear me out. Was this your plan all along, to sleep with me then turn on me? Of course not. I've been calling you to tell you. Tell me what, that you were about to ruin my life? I had every intention of being your alibi, Karen, but when she asked me to be hers... I mean, what do you want me to say? She's my mother. But you came to me ready to speak on my behalf, against her. She doesn't ask for help, Karen, and she asked me for this. She begged. She sobbed. I couldn't say no. I can't believe this. Hey. I get that you're angry, but don't act like I betrayed you on some deep personal level or anything. We slept together once, and you couldn't even bother to return my calls. You knew as well as I did this wasn't going anywhere. I did what I had to do. I'm sorry it had to end this way. [Music] Transfer complete. She didn't even open her eyes. We should do this more often. I can't tell you the last time that Madi fell asleep in the car. Thank you for today... And for the unsolicited advice. I'm sorry. I know I should just... No. I think you're right. I'm gonna tell Lucy. See, now I'm scared. I gave you advice, and you're gonna follow it, it's gonna be disastrous. You gave me advice. I decided to take it. So if it's a disaster, it's all on me. How are you gonna do it? Whew. I'm not sure yet. I'll pick her up from school tomorrow, take her for some ice cream and... Pray that a scoop of mint chip gets us through the toughest conversation of our lives. Might I suggest double scoop? [Chuckles] [Latch clicks] [Keys jangle] Hey. Hey, babe. [Exhales] I've been calling you. You have? I'm sorry. You know I always turn my phone off when I work. Have you been at the showing this whole time? Yeah, I know. It sucks, huh? So what did you and Stacey end up doing? We just... we went to a restaurant, and that was it. I wish you hadn't missed her. Me, too. Maybe tomorrow? I don't think she can. She has to go see her mom, and then... Then they're leaving tomorrow night. Oh. What is that? Hmm? Is that a bite mark? Hmm? Um... [Exhales deeply] I kind of... Went the way of our hypothetical conversation. Yeah, I can see that. When did that happen? Do we really need to talk about it? No. This is a definitely a conversation I do not need to have. Good night. [Sighs] [People speaking indistinctly] Did you ask him? [Elevator bell dings] No. Hey. Uh, is this okay? You look great. Thanks for coming. As I said, it's my pleasure. I know this is a silly question, but did you and Karen ever make a habit of working late together? Please stop. It's only because Karen remembers working the night of Thomas' death, and I was just wondering if maybe... Oh. Uh... yes. Of course. Jacob. Karen... can I answer? Yes, it is very possible I was with Karen that night. [Baby crying] Good day. Name? Um, well, I don't have an appointment. Uh, Harry Davis. [Clicking keyboard keys] I should be in your records there. Well, my wife, actually... [Clears throat] Should be in your records. Savannah Davis. Ah. She, uh... [Lowered voice] She had a paternity test done about six weeks ago. [Continues clicking] Oh. You're not named. Not named as... As the father? No, no, not named on the consent form. As someone who can be told any diagnostic information. Right. But you, um... You have the diagnostic information right there in front of you, don't you? Well, yeah, I do. You could just tell me. I can't. That seems unfair, doesn't it, you, a pretty stranger knowing, and me, the kid's potential father out here completely in the dark? Mr. Davis, I can't. Really? Is there a problem here, Melanie? I really can't. [Baby fussing] [Clicking keyboard keys] Can you state your name for the record? Jacob Pollack. You know Dr. Kim well? We went to medical school together. Of course, she graduated in the top 1%. Me, not so much. Uh, anyway, we reconnected in 2007 at an awards ceremony. At which she shockingly was honored. Uh, for her minority patient outreach work, I think. We understand. She's accomplished. He's a character witness. [Scoffs] Go on, Dr. Pollack. We formed our practice together in 2008. I'd like to talk about the night that Thomas Grey died. Okay, sure. Do you remember where you were that night? Yes, I do. I was... I was at the office. Were you alone? No. Lila was there with him. Our receptionist. Karen. I had given her a stack of cases to file before I headed home. Karen, please. It's my turn to speak. Mr. Taylor, first question? Let's start with your notes from the sessions with Thomas Grey. Why don't you ask me what you really want to know? What do I really want to know? Where was I the night Thomas died? All right. Where were you? Home. Alone. [Exhales] I remember because Tom and I had spoken that morning. And... he didn't sound very good. I wanted to be with him. But then again, I always wanted to be with him. We were in love, you see? At least, he was the love of my life. I need a moment with my client. No, you don't. I fell in love with a married man. That was the first crime I committed. And I prescribed him morphine so that he could end his life... Because I loved him so deeply, I couldn't stand the thought of him suffering. And when he asked if I would help him end his own life... I said I would. But that call never came. I believe Elizabeth Grey ended his life. [Scoffs] This is insane. Elizabeth. [Sighs] What the circumstances were, I'll never know. But I know what I did. I know the mistakes I've made. And now my conscience is clear. [Exhales] I doubt you can say the same. [Sighs] [Cereal clinks in bowl] You know what? I changed my mind. I do want to talk about it. Alex, please don't overreact. When the person that I'm in a relationship with comes home with a bite mark, I feel, I think, that I have a right to know whose teeth it came from. What does it matter? It was a guy. And you said... I said we could discuss boundaries, and then you went and slept with someone without telling me about it, which feels really weird. Only because you're making it really weird. Okay, if it's so not a big deal... then just tell me who it is. Fine. You want to know who it was? Yes. It was Olivier. Olivier? Your boss Olivier? Mm-hmm. The guy that you're obsessed with? I wouldn't say obsessed. Wow. You're unbelievable. Okay, you know what, Alex? You're the one who brought up s*x with men in the first place. You opened the door. Hypothetically. Hypothetically. There is nothing hypothetical about Olivier. If you had come to me and asked me if you could have s*x with Olivier, I would've said no, door's closed. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just not used to having to ask permission to have s*x with people. Besides, I thought you said that it didn't matter. God. It does matter. It does... Wait a second. Wait a second. Was this last night? Did you cancel plans with my friend so that you could go have s*x with your boss? Oh, my God. [Groans] Oh, my God. Alex, it wasn't a plan. I really had to show a house, and then... What kind of person does that? [Door closes] [Huffs] Oh. This is the problem with women. They're too hung up on s*x. [Laughs] Yes. Some of them are. Uh, before we go any further, can we just talk about Karen? Have you spoken to her, and did she mention anything about how the depos are going? No clue. Okay. Back to you. I mean, is Alex really gonna kick me out of her life just because I slept with one guy? Which, by the way, she said wasn't gonna be a huge deal. Well, I'm sure now that it happened, she feels differently, right? I mean, it's one thing for it to be a hypothetical. Oh, if I hear "hypothetical" one more time, I'm gonna kill someone. Okay, you know what? Maybe we should go downstairs and have some ice cream. That's what people do when they get in fights. Oh, no. And don't say "ice cream" either. Okay. I'll just let you talk. Well, what's the big deal? Alex and I were... We were great, and Olivier was just s*x. It meant nothing. I mean, no offense, but you had s*x with Dominic, and obviously, you still love Harry. Oh, what... relationships are complicated. You just said "relationship". Oh, Lord. Here it comes. No. I'm proud of you. I know how hard it is for you to even say that word when you're talking about yourself. You're maturing. Ewe. Can we change the subject? [Sighs] How was New York? It was amazing. Mm. Dom put me up in the Four Seasons hotel. He booked me a prenatal massage. Man, the guy is really, uh, pulling out all the stops, huh? Yeah. He is, and you know what? It feels really nice. So what are you saying, that you have feelings for him now? Joss, I always had feelings for him. You know, that's how this whole thing started. I've just been fighting them for so long, and... I don't see any reason to fight them anymore. Do you? Honestly, I don't know, Bug. I mean, do I not give something with Dom a chance... Just because of the way it started? [Children speaking indistinctly] [Indistinct conversations] [Woman] Practice at home. It'll be great. [Laughs] Okay? Excuse me. Bye. Uh, I'm a little late for pickup today. I'm April, Lucy Malloy's mom. Oh, of course. Lucy was in my music class this afternoon. So you've seen her. Yeah, she came out with the rest of the kids, I'm pretty sure of it. Maybe she went home with a friend? No. She knew I was coming. We were gonna have ice cream together. We had a plan. Lucy! Okay, let me go get the Principal. Did you see a man with her? He would've been in a rental car. Try to stay calm, Mrs. Malloy. I'll be right back, we're gonna find her. Lucy! Lucy!
