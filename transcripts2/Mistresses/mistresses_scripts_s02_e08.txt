 Your phone's ringing! 
 Sorry. Just ignore it. It's... it's the girl. 
 Previously on "mistresses"... 
 [ Gasps ] 
 I am in love with you, and I think you should move in with me. 
 Savi : I accepted an offer. 
 You sure about this? 
 No. 
 What were you getting from Zack that you couldn't get from me?! 
 I don't know. 
 You need to figure that out. Let's call it a break. 
 I'm here to apologize. 
 For being married?! 
 And I love you. 
 April : [ Voice breaking ] I just need to be with you right now. 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 Hey, hey. 
 Hey. [ Sniffs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You couldn't sleep? 
 When you're with me... 
 Where does she think you are... your wife? 
 Never mind. I don't even want to know. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 The marriage is over, April. 
 We're not even... 
 Stop. 
 W-what? You're leaving? 
 I have to! 
 [ Stammers ] S-so this is goodbye?! 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You made me love you. 
 You made me need you! 
 Well, I need you, too. 
 Hey, April, I love you so much. 
 Can't you feel that? 
 I'll call you. 
 No. 
 I'll call you. 
 April, I'm sorry! 
 Just... just... 
 Just tell me you'll be back. 
 I don't know. 
 [ Sighs ]

 S02E08 - An Affair to Surrender 
 So, you had no idea the woman Jacob's been seeing is your patient? 
 None whatsoever, and I'm the reason Jacob broke things off with her. 
 If Anna ever found that out, I... 
 Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
 Have you said anything about this to Jacob? 
 Of course not. 
 Oh, good. [ Sighs ] 
 I don't need that. 
 No, this is for me. 
 Now, what about Jacob? 
 Do you plan to keep seeing him romantically? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's more than just attraction with him. 
 It feels right. He knows me. 
 The good, the bad, the ugly, the awful, and he... [ Inhales deeply ] ...he still wants me, maybe all the more because of it. 
 I don't want to lose him. 
 Then you have to stop seeing Anna. 
 She needs me. She has no one else. 
 She's made a connection with me. 
 She's young and vulnerable and... 
 And very much like Sam. 
 And you think this is a chance to do things right. 
 This is a troubled girl, Irving. 
 Stopping her treatment while she's dealing with Jacob's rejection, she may become suicidal again. 
 And she may not. 
 Is that supposed to be helpful?! 
 Look... 
 Anna may react badly to having to switch doctors, but you may slip into a depression again if you lose the first shot you've had at an appropriate relationship in a very long time. 
 Just think about that before you do anything rash. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, it's none of my business, but are you okay? 
 [ Sighing ] Yeah. 
 Fine. I'm totally, you know, just...Fine. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What is that for? 
 In case you cry. 
 I know you and I got off on the wrong foot. 
 But we're more alike than you think. 
 We're ambitious. We're attractive. 
 We're working in a man's world. 
 And speaking of which, I'd really like to just concentrate on the work here, so... 
 I'm in awe of you, really. 
 I was looking through some of your old cases. 
 If you ask me, you should have made partner by now. 
 Why haven't you, though? 
 As far as I understand it, your and Dom's affair was well-known last year. 
 But Dom still got a promotion. 
 Seems unfair. 
 Look... 
 I know we've had our differences, Savi, but... 
 We shouldn't be enemies. 
 We should be helping each other. 
 Maybe one day, we could even be friends. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Okay, two things. 
 One, get your ass off my case files. 
 Thank you. 
 And two, in order to be my friend, I actually have to trust you, and I will never... ever trust you. 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 Excuse me. It's my real-estate agent. 
 Hello? 
 What?! 
 Okay. All right. 
 [ Sighs ] Bye. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hey, uh, now that we're gonna be roomies, do you think that my lady shoes can live with your lady shoes? 
 Yeah, you know, I mean, as long as you think they're ready for that kind of commitment, sure. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Chuckling ] Well, then we're gonna have to move some of these puppies out of here, right? 
 Like, what? WNBA? 
 I... yeah. 
 Worst night of my life... don't want to talk about it. 
 Tell you what... why don't we just take every pair of shoes that's not your size and, um... 
 You know, just get rid of 'em? We'll Chuck 'em? 
 [ Thud ] 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Although... 
 What? 
 Well, it's... 
 You know what? It's stupid. 
 Don't worry about it. It's stupid. 
 Oh, Scott, come on. Tell me. 
 Um... [ Smacks lips ] 
 Okay, uh... 
 It's just, yesterday, I told you that I loved you, and you responded by making an epic three-pointer. 
 Yes, you did say it, didn't you? 
 Yeah. 
 And I didn't say anything. 
 No. 
 Then I... because, you know, it just... it happened so fast, a-and I-I was... 
 I didn't know what to say, and I panicked, and I'm sorry. 
 I'm a jerk. 
 No, you're not a jerk. 
 No, no, no, Scott, I am because... 
 I do. 
 You do what? 
 Share your feelings. 
 Oh. 
 What feelings? 
 The good ones. The... the... the nice ones. 
 The...fuzzy ones. 
 Okay. 
 Baby, why don't you just say it? 
 [ Sighs deeply ] 
 I love you, too. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Are you gonna pass out? 
 [ Breathes deeply ] 
 No. 
 Good. 
 Why don't you finish unpacking? I want to take you somewhere. 
 [ Sniffles ] Where? 
 No place special, just... 
 Somewhere that'll change your life. 
 Guess what I got us for next Tuesday. 
 Two tickets for Trois Mec. 
 Not reservations, mind you... tickets. 
 It's not a meal, apparently. It's an event. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 I don't even know how to say this. 
 So I'm just gonna say it. 
 We can't see each other anymore. 
 [ Scoffs ] Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 What... What are you talking about? 
 I'm so sorry. I... 
 Why? 
 My therapist said it's too soon for me to start dating again. 
 But... 
 But you told me you have been dating. 
 Yes, but I hadn't shared that with my therapist. 
 But you've shared it with him now? 
 Yes, because of you. 
 Because you're significant to me in a way others weren't. 
 And because I have deep feelings for you. 
 And because we have a friendship and history, it accelerates things. 
 Well, I hope you don't feel like I-I was pressuring you. 
 You weren't. 
 Do you want to take things slower? 
 I want things to stop. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 My therapist said... 
 I shouldn't have started dating for a year. I... 
 Yeah, I got that part. 
 You asked me out, Karen. 
 Jacob, I... 
 You made me end things with the other girl I was seeing for what? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Do me a favor. 
 When your year is up... Don't call me. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 So, what do you think? 
 Oh, my God! 
 What do I think? 
 Uh, I think you've been leading a double life. 
 How could you not tell me that you own a restaurant? 
 Well, 10% own anyway. 
 When does this place open? 
 Middle of next month. 
 And you own this with... 
 My friend Greta. 
 Greta : [ German accent ] Scott! 
 Willkommen! 
 That's Greta. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 I'll be right down. 
 You're friends with Greta Jager?! 
 Yeah. 
 Swimsuit model Greta Jager? 
 Oh, my God. I'm so turned on by you right now. 
 Hello, handsome. 
 How are you? 
 Mwah! Mwah! 
 This is my girlfriend, Joss. 
 Pleasure. 
 I've heard so much about you. 
 Yeah, I was just telling her that we're looking for an event planner to do the opening. 
 What? No, you weren't. I was going to. 
 I want big and splashy. 
 I do big and splashy. 
 Uh, Harry leaves next week, though. 
 Well, that's the beauty of it. He won't need him. 
 This place already has a chef, right? 
 Dieter Krause. 
 Peter Krause? 
 No, uh, Dieter with a "D." 
 If the opening goes well, we keep you on as our in-house planner. 
 Oh! What can I say? 
 Say you will taste some food and tell me your ideas. 
 [ Stammers ] Feed me, Dieter Krause! 
 Wunderbar! [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Squeals ] 
 Vanessa : Sorry to pull you out of work like that, but the buyer's requesting to speed up escrow. 
 We could close by the end of the week. 
 Wait, b-by the end of this week? 
 Well, I know Harry's moving soon, so I drew up the paperwork just in case. 
 Oh, obviously, this would be good for me, but it's... It's up to Savi. 
 I don't want to... push you out before you're ready. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Y-you know what? Let's just do it. 
 Joss is about to move out of the house, and... it's just starting to feel less and less like home, so [Inhales deeply] let's not drag this out. 
 Just sign where the stickies are. 
 [ Sighing ] Okay. 
 Hey, w-why is the buyer suddenly in such a rush? 
 Oh, he wants to remodel the kitchen before move-in. 
 The kitchen?! Is he crazy?! 
 It's the best room in the house. 
 Yeah, does he realize that a four-star chef actually designed this kitchen? 
 I wouldn't change a thing, but, you know, there's no accounting for taste. 
 Well... 
 Oh, Savi, before I forget, I have a condo to show you tomorrow. 
 How's 1:00? 
 Uh, yes, 1:00 will be fine. 
 Great. 
 Oh, you missed one. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Clock ticking ] 
 [ Ringing ] 
 Anna :  Hey, sorry we missed each other. Leave me a message.  [Beep] 
 Hi, Anna. It's Dr. Kim. 
 Um... 
 It's half past, and we have an appointment today. 
 Okay, I'm still here if you're on your way. 
 Call me anytime. 
 I finished my homework. Can I sleep at Peyton's tonight? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 No way! 
 We're having gift bags tomorrow?! 
 You can't have a nail-art birthday party without manicure sets. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You found the sparkly stickers?! 
 And I got extras just for you. 
 This is gonna be the best birthday party ever. 
 Do you think Daniel's gonna let me paint his nails? 
 I thought you just wanted it to be all girls. 
 Daniel doesn't count. He has to come. 
 The nail-art party was his idea. 
 I know, but... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I didn't want to have to tell you this before your birthday... 
 But Daniel and I broke up. 
 When? Why? 
 Sweetie, it's...hard to explain. 
 So, did he break up with you? 
 It's complicated. 
 What's complicated? 
 You love each other, don't you? 
 I mean [Sighs] you're, like, glowing when he's around. 
 You're so perfect together. 
 And I thought we all might be a family. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I know. I know. 
 Don't give up on him, mom. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 She...loved you. 
 Really? How can you tell? 
 Are you kidding? She was guffawing over all your jokes. 
 You actually got that woman to look unattractive. 
 No, no, I didn't. 
 Yeah, she's really beautiful, isn't she? It's weird. 
 Yeah, you know, there's just this... there's just one thing. 
 She's got mannish calves, right? 
 Is that what you were gonna say? 
 No, no, no, Scott. 
 Scott, the food's kind of terrible. 
 What? 
 It's boring. 
 What... what was that... bacon-wrapped figs? Please! 
 Aoc's been porking up all kinds of fruit since before the Terminator was mayor. 
 Governor. 
 Whatever! 
 Yeah, so chef Dieter's not that inspired. 
 Scott, "not that inspired" doesn't work in this city. 
 Harry's a million times better chef than Dieter, and his restaurant failed. 
 Tell me this... would you come back to a restaurant with that kind of food? 
 [ Fingers snap ] 
 Bam, there's your answer. 
 Honey, you've got to tell her. 
 I've... I'm not telling her anything. 
 This restaurant's her baby. [ Sighs ] 
 Her baby's ugly, honey, and somebody's got to tell her, or else it's gonna get crucified on its first day of school. 
 Yeah, look, I am a silent investor, so I'm not gonna say a word, and I suggest if you want this job, you shouldn't say a word either, okay? 
 Fine. 
 Let's go. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 I missed you. 
 I missed you, too. 
 It's everything you've been asking for... less upkeep, more security. 
 There's even a pool with cabanas on the roof. 
 [ Gasps ] Cabanas! 
 Oh, just what I need. 
 [ Cellphone ringing ] 
 Oh, just a second. Keep looking. 
 Talk to me. 
 You hate it, don't you? 
 No, I mean [Sighs] I guess it's fine. 
 Well, then why do you keep looking like you want to jump out that window? 
 It's just not what I pictured. 
 I thought I'd be moving in with Dom. 
 Honey, that could still happen. 
 Your relationship's just on pause. 
 What if he meets someone else? 
 Oh, Savi! 
 What? 
 Dom loves you. 
 And you know that I am not the biggest fan of his, but he's way too smart to let you go. 
 He's just... he's hurt. Give him some time. 
 You know, we could move in here together. 
 Didn't you just move in with Scott? 
 I just... I-I don't want to leave you alone. 
 Okay, I'm not 80. I can live on my own. 
 Oh, I know. 
 Just, you took care of me, so I want to take care of you. 
 You've paid your dues in that respect. 
 Hmm? 
 The whole recovery and... [ Inhales deeply ] 
 ...everything after, and, yes, you were right about Zack. 
 [ Sighs ] And I should have listened to you. 
 Yeah, well, I'm so rarely right that I'm not surprised you didn't. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 Can we hug now, please? 
 Yes. 
 Come here. 
 Mm. 
 Mwah! 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Wow, this place is white. 
 It really is just white. 
 It's like a bathroom. Let's get out of here. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, she was admitted to the hospital two months ago. 
 Her name is Anna Choi... C-H-O-I. 
 Did she leave any other number than her mobile? 
 What about an address? 
 Well, you must have it there. 
 [ Cellphone chiming ] 
 Sorry, Mary, I-I have to go. 
 [ Telephone beeps ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hello? Anna? 
 Anna : [ Crying ] 
 Are you there? 
 A-Anna, can you hear me? 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 Are you okay? 
 Anna?! 
 Greta : Mm! Love this. 
 Mm. 
 Love this. 
 I want you to do this for the opening. 
 Wait, does this mean... 
 You got the job! You're in! 
 Oh, I'm "een"! [ Giggles ] 
 Great! 
 Welcome to the team. 
 Let's have chef Dieter make you something to celebrate. 
 Oh, no, no, I couldn't. I'm... I'm... 
 I insist. 
 Okay. You know what? 
 Actually, Greta, I wanted to ask you, what are some of your favorite dishes that he does? 
 The stuffed artichokes... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ...and the, um... 
 Hmm. 
 Funny, that's all I've tried. 
 I've been vegan and gluten-free for the past 18 months, but everyone else loves the food. 
 Oh. Uh, is... is that what they say? 
 Oh, yes. [ Chuckles ] 
 Dieter is one of my oldest friends. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh! I am telling you, this guy's food sucks the big suck. 
 All right, can you just, uh, scooch? 
 I'm trying to garnish. Oh, and ready for crazy? 
 Greta hasn't even tried most of it! 
 What are these? 
 They're blindfolds for the guys. It's a bris. 
 Hey, are you listening to me?! Dieter's a dud! 
 [ Sighs ] So? 
 "So?" Harry, I need this place to succeed. 
 I haven't been working my ass off to be a part of a restaurant vanity project that's gonna fail. 
 I have a reputation to protect. 
 Mm-hmm. [ Sighs ] 
 And it just so happens that it's an incredible opportunity for you. 
 For me? Why? What? What are you talking about? 
 This place could be huge with the right chef. 
 Harry Davis. 
 Oh, yeah. Except wait a minute. 
 You're forgetting, uh, I'm moving back to Australia. 
 I know, but let's just pretend that you weren't. 
 Listen, Harry, all we would have to do is let Greta and her people taste your food, and... 
 No! 
 Just hear me out. 
 I'm not interested, Joss. 
 Hmph! 
 Okay, I've got a plane ticket, I've got a job lined up, and my family is expecting me. 
 Thank you for thinking of me, though. I do appreciate it. 
 Now pass me those tongs. 
 Hmm. 
 Chop-chop. 
 [ Tongs snap ] 
 "Chop-chop." 
 Merci. 
 [ Whistles ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 [ Up-tempo music plays ] 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Cute party, April. 
 The girls are having a great time. 
 I'm glad you were able to make it. 
 Are you being fake nice, or have you finally forgiven me? 
 Let's just say I'm over it. 
 Well, look who's becoming more flexible. 
 Oh, would you excuse me a second? 
 Sure. 
 Hey! You look... 
 A wreck? I know. I didn't sleep last night. 
 What's wrong? 
 Critical patient of mine has been missing for 24 hours. 
 Oh, my God. What can you do? 
 Nothing. I can't do anything. 
 God, I hate my job. 
 [ Sighs ] God. I'm sorry. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 How are you holding up? 
 Oh. You know, I'm fine. 
 Did you talk to Daniel? 
 No. 
 How did you leave things? 
 I... Ended it. 
 It's over. 
 How did that go? 
 It's awful. Look, I really don't want to talk about it. 
 [ Inhales sharply ] 
 Of course. 
 Just know if you ever want to talk, I'm here. 
 I've been there. 
 How have you been there? 
 Well, you know, Tom... 
 You started an affair with a married man, knowing he was married. 
 I didn't do that. We're not the same. 
 You're right. I'm... 
 Sorry I mentioned it. 
 I should give Lucy her present. 
 [ Paper rustling ] 
 
 
 
 Joss : You know what, Javi? 
 Uh, will you just take some of these sodas to the valets, please? 
 Thank you. 
 Yep, coming right up! 
 Where's Javier? We need the buttermilk steamed chicken. 
 Oh, uh, we're out. 
 What? We can't be. 
 I just made a whole new plate. 
 Oh, well, maybe Javier already took them out. 
 You just missed him. He's quick. 
 The Kennebec fries are gone, too. I just put... 
 Oh, no, I definitely saw those go out. 
 On, come on, let's just have a drink. It's our last party, Harry. 
 Has the dog been in here? 
 Huh? 
 Do they have a dog? 
 Where the hell is all my food going?! Javier?! 
 The '90s are back in, right? 
 Not that back. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Okay. How about this one? 
 Now that you should definitely get rid of. 
 Do you want it? 
 If you insist. 
 You can have it. Here you go. 
 Ooh! 
 Hey, can I have these? 
 Well, I'm not dying. 
 You're downsizing. 
 I'm pretty sure those little earrings are gonna fit in my new condo. 
 I can't believe you're not gonna live here anymore. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Neither can I. 
 Remember when you had us all come over to paint the living room? 
 Joss : [ Gasps ] Yes! 
 Oh, and April said that we should use the rollers. 
 And Savi insisted we rent those high-torque paint sprayers. 
 Which farted and exploded! 
 [ Laughter ] 
 [ All sigh ] 
 I lived here for three full months after Paul died. 
 Sort of died. 
 I hate him. 
 And Lucy spent her first birthday here. 
 And the party celebrating my doctorate. 
 [ Chuckles ] My graduation party. 
 Real-estate school. 
 Oh. 
 My 30th, 31st... 
 And 35th. 
 Hmm. 
 It's a good house. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You know what? Come here, girls. 
 To Savi's house. 
 The good times. 
 And the tough times that made us stronger. 
 [ Glasses clink ] 
 To my house. 
 [ Cellphone chiming, vibrating ] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Mary. 
 Oh, you found Anna's address? I'm writing it down now. 
 Good. Okay. 
 I'm so sorry. I have to go. 
 Hey, Karen, I was... I was hoping... it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Uh, you know what? I'd better go, too. Scott's waiting on me. 
 Bye. [ Smooches ] 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 And then there were two. [ Sighs ] 
 How are you? 
 I haven't really talked to you since you decided to end things with Daniel. 
 I'm... fine. 
 There's just been a... a lot of changes lately. 
 It's the end of an era. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 [ Crickets chirping ] 
 [ Doorbell rings ] 
 May I help you? 
 Yes, um...I'm looking for Anna Choi. 
 There's no one here by that name. 
 Did you move in recently? 
 No, I've lived here for 35 years. 
 Oh. 
 So sorry to bother you. 
 Hi, Jacob. 
 Maybe I wasn't clear. 
 When I said I didn't want to talk, that included texting me or stopping by my office. 
 I'm not here for myself. 
 This is about Anna Choi. 
 Well... 
 Well, h-h-how do you know Anna? 
 [ Sighs ] She's my patient. 
 This is why you ended things? 
 I don't know if I should even be here, except I think her life may be in danger. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 When was the last time you spoke to her? 
 Uh... 
 A few days ago when I, you know, broke things off. 
 How did she take it? 
 Uh, it was over the phone. I don't really know. 
 I mean, w-we weren't that serious. 
 She was serious. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 W-well, h-have you tried calling her? 
 Yes, and I've left messages. 
 Plus, I got a strange call from her where she didn't say anything, but I could hear she was crying. 
 W-why don't you just knock on her door? 
 I mean, she lives in your building, right? 
 Uh, what are you talking about? 
 I-I met her in your lobby. 
 W-when I came to... to see you a couple months ago, she told me she lived there. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Can you call her just so that I know she's okay? 
 She might answer a call from you. I... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Straight to voicemail. 
 Hey, Anna, it's... it's Jacob. 
 Uh, could you give me a call when you get this? 
 I-I'd like to talk. 
 Bye. 
 Will you call me if you hear from her? 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 Hey, look, the other day, the things I said... 
 You couldn't have known. 
 I'll see you? 
 Hey. I got your text. What's up? 
 Guess where I just was. 
 Hmm, spending way too much on pressed juice. 
 Having breakfast... 
 With Greta Jager. 
 Fascinating. 
 Oh, isn't it, though? 
 You know what's even more fascinating, uh, Joss, she wants to make me the head chef of Wunderbar. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 That's amaze-balls! 
 It really is... 
 Yeah! amaze-balls, considering Greta had never even been to Savannah's kitchen. 
 Huh. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, she must have, uh... what? 
 Tried your food somewhere else, maybe at one of the parties we catered. 
 Cut the crap. You were the dog. 
 I know you were the dog. 
 So, I pocketed some food. 
 Pbht. [ Sighs ] 
 She said that you... 
 Set up a secret taste test? 
 Oh, ple... okay, that's an exaggeration. 
 G-Greta was having a little get-together, and I placed some of your plates around where Dieter's dishes were, and yours were way more popular! 
 Like "Sluttiest girl in school" popular. 
 You had no right to do that. 
 I specifically asked you not to do this, Joss. 
 I just... [ Sighs ] What? 
 God, I thought... I was trying to help you! 
 I didn't ask for your help, Joss. 
 I can take care of my own life. Thank you very much! 
 Wow! Fine! 
 Then don't take the job! Move back to Australia! 
 I don't care! 
 Pbht. Well, I'm... I'm taking the job. 
 What did you say? 
 Headlining at the hottest new restaurant in L.A. 
 I'm not an idiot. 
 [ Thud ] 
 Well, you could have led with that! 
 [ Both laughing ] 
 [ Squeals ] 
 Thank you. Thanks. 
 Yes! 
 [ Clicking ] 
 All right, that's enough phone time for today. 
 [ Cellphone vibrating ] 
 Please, just a little more. 
 Maybe after you've studied for your spelling test. 
 But this is an emergency! 
 Peyton just found out her dad has been sleeping with Alexa's mom. 
 Everyone's saying they did it at the food drive. 
 What?! 
 They did it at school? 
 Everyone's texting Peyton, asking if it's true. 
 She's denying it. 
 I feel so bad for her. Not only that, she... 
 What? What is it? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Peyton made me promise not to tell anyone, but... 
 You're my mom, so I don't think it counts. 
 Peyton told me her dad has cheated on her mom before. 
 And her mom knows about it. 
 But it's the first time the kids at school have found out. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What are you thinking? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I just... I don't get it. 
 Who would do that with a married man? 
 It's so mean to his wife. 
 Uh, there's no easy answer for that. 
 Well [Sighs] I think it's gross. 
 And Peyton's mom is so smart and pretty... deserves so much better. 
 Why does she stay with him if he keeps cheating on her? 
 Maybe because... some people don't think they deserve better. 
 They don't think they can demand more of the people they're with. 
 Some people use being in love as an excuse. 
 Which is why I am always reminding you of how important it is to know your self-worth. 
 To believe in myself? 
 And to value yourself. 
 Because when you do, other people will, too. 
 When I grow up, I want to be just like you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Yep. 
 Yeah, sending you the amended discovery responses right now. 
 Okay, great. 
 Great. 
 You know where to reach me. 
 Huh. 
 I thought part time meant when you're not at the office, you're not working. 
 Oh, no, it just means that I'm in the office part time. 
 I have news. 
 Okay. Good news? 
 Well, I think it's good, but if you don't think it's not good, we don't have to talk about it. 
 Okay. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Harry's not moving. 
 He's staying in L.A. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I'm glad. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm. 
 But I have claim on the house. 
 Huh? 
 I'm not moving either. 
 Whoa. Wait. What?! 
 I'm keeping the house. 
 But... You're in escrow. 
 I know, and it's gonna cost me, too. 
 What about Harry's cut? 
 I'll buy him out. 
 Savi, this is huge! What... what the hell happened? 
 [ Sighs ] Last night happened. 
 Just being with you guys and remembering that this house holds some really good memories, too. 
 Huh, or you could take the memories with you. 
 Yeah, that's what mom said each and every time she tried to uproot us from some place we loved. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You know, I was thinking about it the other day. 
 Do you know how many times we moved before I left for college? 
 11. 
 Yeah. 
 And three more times after you left. 
 This place is the longest I've lived anywhere... 
 My entire life. 
 It's truly the first place that has ever felt like home. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Anna! 
 Sorry I missed my last appointment. 
 I know I should have called. 
 But I just... [ Chuckles ] I had to get out of here. 
 [ Chuckles ] I drove to Joshua Tree! 
 Don't worry... I didn't drop acid or anything. 
 I'm just glad you're okay. 
 Uh, let me get my book, and we can set up a proper time for us to talk. 
 I needed to clear my head. Last week was horrible. 
 Remember that guy I was telling you about the one I've been seeing? 
 A few days ago, he called and said he couldn't see me anymore. 
 Over the phone. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Out of the blue, and his reasons made no sense. 
 He said I was too young. [ Scoffs ] 
 We've been sleeping together for weeks, and you just realized I was young? 
 I thought maybe there was someone else, but... 
 Just as I was starting to feel centered again, guess who calls and leaves a message. 
 The guy. [ Scoffs ] 
 And you know what that means. 
 What does it mean to you? 
 He clearly wants to get back together. 
 I could hear it in his voice. 
 He said he wanted to talk. Why else would he call? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I'm gonna make him sweat a little. 
 I'll wait a few days to call him. Don't worry. 
 And... That's due to you. 
 How so? 
 I think this therapy thing is working. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 As bad as last week was, I was able to deal, to neutralize my self-destructive thoughts, as you say. 
 I can feel myself changing, like I'm finally getting better. 
 Thank you, Dr. Kim. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 What's wrong? 
 I've come to say goodbye. 
 What do you want me to say? It's over. It's done. 
 Yeah, but last night... 
 I still love you. God, I love you. 
 I wish I didn't, but I do. 
 Well, then why are you doing this? 
 Because being with you is turning me into someone I cannot stand. 
 I'm a hypocrite in church. I am lying to my friends, saying things I can't believe are coming out my mouth, pretending like this isn't hurting your wife. 
 She doesn't know! 
 You think it still doesn't do damage?! 
 If there's one thing I know... 
 And even if there weren't all that, there's Lucy. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 If I let her down... 
 I would never forgive myself. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I'm sorry...Daniel. 
 No, look. Please, don't, April. 
 April, don't do this. 
 I won't be calling you again. 
 Ta-da! 
 Last box? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm officially moved in. 
 I love it. All right [Claps] taking you out to celebrate. 
 How does Sushi sound? 
 Oh, fab. 
 Oh, but can we do it on the later side? 
 Because I have to go meet Harry to brainstorm about the new wunderbar menu. 
 Uh, wait, Harry is... 
 Wait, did Greta not told you? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 Wow, you really are a hands-off investor, aren't you? 
 He is the new head chef, and it's all because of moi! 
 Oh, you're kidding? That's really great. 
 What? That's it? 
 This is... this is a major coup for... 
 Yeah. 
 ...the restaurant, for Harry, for y... 
 No, I get it. I-I-I totally get it. 
 It's just, uh... 
 What? 
 You do an awful lot for this guy. 
 Harry? 
 Yeah, Harry. 
 I mean, I understood why you were so upset that he was leaving before. 
 It affected your business, but now you guys... 
 You guys won't even be partners. 
 I'm... I'm trying to figure out... 
 Why him staying is so important to you. 
 It's not. 
 Well, I mean, it is but just because we're friends. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Because you were right all along. 
 He never would have been happy at that crab shack, and I was just trying to make him realize it before he made a huge mistake. 
 Hey, what's wrong with you? 
 Oh, my God, you're... 
 No, no, no, you're not worried about, like, Harry and me... 
 Right? 
 Should I be? I don't know. 
 Oh, my God, no! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no! No! 
 That would be... he's like my brother, Scott. 
 He's... he's, you know, Savi's ex-husband. 
 That would never in a million trillion years happen. 
 Okay. 
 He's family, yeah? 
 Just making sure. 
 Hey, be very, very, very sure. 
 Okay? Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Is this helping? 
 Not really? Is this helping? 
 That's helping. 
 Does this help? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's helpful. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] 
 Toni : Don't worry. She's not here. 
 Trouble in paradise? 
 What do you care? 
 Ouch. Okay. 
 You really think I'm gonna talk about my personal life with you? 
 I don't know what's going on with you, and you don't have to tell me, but if you do want to talk, you can because... don't take this wrong, but I don't know how many other people you have in your life to talk about this with. 
 I have friends, Toni. 
 I know you do. Sure. 
 But, really, how often do you talk to them? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Since I've known you, you're always here. 
 And when you're not, I'm assuming you were with Savi. 
 You're the guy who wants his name on the building. 
 I know this because I'm the same way. 
 And I also know one of the first things you give up on your way to the top is friends. 
 Look, I can I'm say I'm sorry till I go blue in the face, but you won't take it, and I really don't expect you to. 
 But just know if you ever want to talk... 
 I'm here till midnight, too. 
 Thank you, Toni. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Thanks for having me over. 
 I-I-I just wanted to talk this through. 
 Anna called me back. 
 Already? What did you say? 
 Nothing. I-I let it go to voicemail. 
 Well, you have to call her back. 
 I-I know I have to call her back. 
 That's the problem... to say what? 
 I mean, d-does she think I want her back? 
 She sounded kind of... I don't know...Hopeful. 
 You can't. Sorry. 
 It's my fault. 
 If I hadn't come to you, you wouldn't have called her. 
 [ Sighs ] I-I-I'll figure it out. 
 I'll be...caring but... noncommittal. 
 Jacob, we really can't... 
 Right. Sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Is that all you wanted to talk to me about? 
 Uh, no. 
 Um, I-I know this isn't the time or the place, but once this is resolved... do you think we could ever... pick up where we left off? 
 I really hope so, Jacob. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I'll walk you out. 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] 
 I can take it from here. 
 Good night, Karen. 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] 
 Anna.
