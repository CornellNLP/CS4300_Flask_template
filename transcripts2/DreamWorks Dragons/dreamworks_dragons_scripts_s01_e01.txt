 Let's go, bud. 
 Whoa, nice. 
 This is Berk. 
 For generations, it was viking against dragon. 
 The battles were ferocious. 
 Then one day, everything changed. 
 I met Toothless. 
 Together, we've shown people here that instead of fighting dragons, we can ride them, live with them, even train them. 
 Okay, guys. Best trick competion. 
 Who's up first? 
 Uh... me. 
 Actually, I think it's... me. 
 Sweet baby Thor in a thunderstorm, go! 
 Oh, don't worry, we'll go. 
 And when we go, Hookfang and I are gonna light the sky on fire! 
 I'm alive? 
 I'm alive! 
 Of course I am. 
 It's my turn! 
 Ready, Meatlug? Here we go! 
 Yes! 
 New personal best. 
 My turn! 
 No, my turn! 
 Guys, same dragon. 
 Oh, right. 
 Go left. 
 No, right! 
 No, no, no, right! 
 No, left! 
 This is awesome and scary! 
 We almost died. 
 Ugh, I know. 
 Go again? 
 Hey, it's my turn. 
 You might want to take notes. 
 Let's go. Yah! 
 Okay, Stormfly. Tail flip. 
 Now twirl! 
 Quick, upward spiral! 
 All right, Stormfly! 
 Yea, but can you do it without the dragon? 
 Well, looks like we got our work cut out for us, there, bud. 
 Yea.. Wow... 
 They're still the best. 
 Another win. 
 Good job, bud. 
 Yep, dragons. 
 Most people on Berk would say life here is better since we made peace with them. 
 Unfortunately, dragons are still, well, dragons. 
 Oh, ah, dragon! 
 Let go of my food! 
 Drop it, pesky dragon! 
 Dragons! 
 Get off my roof, you pest! 
 Let go of that! Those are my apples! 
 Give me back my dainties, dragon! 
 Incoming! 
 Look out! 
 Dragon poop! 
 Eew, gross, gross, gross. 
 Oh, poop. Oh, that's disgusting. 
 Hey, Mulch. Hey, Bucket. 
 Sorry about the, uh... 
 Every day at 3:00. 
 They're regular. A tip of the cap. 
 Better than the days when it was kill or be killed. 
 Hey, we've got some fish for that father of yours. 
 Bucket, give the boy the cod. 
 I ate it already? Did I enjoy it? 
 Uh, no, uh, actually, Bucket, I'm... i'm afraid the, uh... 
 Most of us here on Berk are willing to take the good with the bad. 
 But there are those who will never accept the dragons, and will do anything to drive them away. 
 Dragons. 
 I should've known. 
 Helps himself to my roof and my cabbage. 
 My whole field! 
 Gone! 
 That tears it, Fungus. 
 Stand the elk up in the back. 
 Fishing boats just came in with a big catch. 
 Stoick. 
 Ah, here's Mildew with the complaint of the day. 
 You picked a bad time, Mildew. 
 I'm in the middle of storing food. 
 The freeze is coming. 
 It's the dragons again. 
 Those demons are not fit to live among civilized men. 
 Neither are you, Mildew. 
 Why do you think we built your house so far outside of town? 
 Oh, very well, make your jokes. 
 Meanwhile, these dragons upend our village carts... turn people's houses into piles of rubble! 
 Aye, Mildew's right! 
 They even disturb an old man's rest! 
 Can't you see these bags under me eyes? 
 He's right. He's hideous. 
 These are wild and unpredictable beasts. 
 Right you are! 
 They even cracked this man's skull like an egg. 
 Eggs? I like eggs. Scrambled, over easy, poached. 
 You need to put those dragons in cages. 
 I agree! 
 If you don't, they'll eat us out of house and home And destroy the entire village. 
 They don't mean any harm, they're just dragons being dragons. 
 Look, Mildew, if there's a problem, I'll deal with it. 
 Oh, there is a problem, Stoick. 
 And I think I speak for everyone when I say, you better do something about it. 
 We can't just let dragons run wild like they own the place. 
 Hey, we could put up signs. 
 Signs? For dragons? 
 No, for the people. 
 Signs? For vikings? 
 We're not big readers, Stoick. 
 Then we'll build a huge net and stretch it around the plaza. 
 Nets? You do know they breathe fire. 
 I know very well they breathe fire, Gobber. 
 Maybe Mildew was right. 
 We have to figure... 
 No, dad, wait. 
 What if I deal with the dragons? 
 You? 
 Who else? 
 If anyone can control them, I can. 
 I'm the best man for the job. 
 You're not a man yet, Hiccup. 
 Not if you don't give me the chance to be. 
 Fair enough. 
 You'll have your chance. Starting tomorrow. 
 Okay, gang. There's gonna be some changes around here. 
 Get out! Shoo! 
 For the last time, get your nose out of my bread! 
 Hold on, I'll help you... just... 
 No. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 Toothless, stop that fight. I'll put out the sheep. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Get out! 
 Get back here with my cart! 
 Bring that back here! 
 Enough of these dragons! 
 What's he doing? 
 Uh, I think he's helping the dragons break stuff. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. He could really use our help. 
 We'll get to it. 
 In a minute. 
 Sorry about that. 
 And it's 3 o'clock... 
 Oh, no! 
 Oh, everything hurts. 
 Even this. 
 Hiccup? 
 Astrid? Perfect. 
 I don't look too beat up, do I? 
 Oh, great. Dragon pity. 
 Hey, Astrid. 
 What a nice surprise. 
 So, how was your day? 
 Uh, uneventful. 
 Hung around the plaza. 
 You know. 
 Yeah, I do know. 
 We saw you out there. 
 It's hard to believe you're still standing. 
 I'm gonna be seeing flaming sheep in my dreams for the next month. 
 Hiccup! 
 What's going on out there? The plaza looks like a war zone. 
 I know it looks bad. 
 Really bad. 
 But this is only, uh, phase one of my master plan. 
 Oh. So you do have a plan. 
 I do. Of course I do. 
 It's very complex, lots of drawings, several moving parts. 
 Yeah, it's, uh, pretty wild. 
 Well, this better be real, because Mildew stirred up the whole island. 
 And if you don't get those dragons under control, they'll be calling for their heads. 
 Don't worry, bud. Your head's not going anywhere. 
 You do realize there are, like, a bazillion dragons out there, and only one of you. 
 I hope you really do have a plan. 
 
 
 
 That's your plan? 
 Train dragons? 
 Here? Where we used to kill them? 
 Right. Because we don't do that anymore. 
 That's why it's available. 
 Actually, the dragons do seem a little nervous. 
 That's because they're very sensitive. 
 Meatlug especially. 
 She lost a cousin here. 
 We try not to talk about it. 
 It's amazing your dad just gave us the arena. 
 Well, it would be, if he did, yeah. 
 But he didn't, so that's another thing we should try not to talk about. 
 Wait, so, we're going behind your father's back. 
 There you go. Talking about it. 
 Uh, all right. 
 Everybody, here's the thing. 
 The dragons are out of control. 
 We want them to live in our world without destroying it, but they can't without our help. 
 They've been blowing things up in the village. 
 We've gotta do something about that. 
 Got it. Help dragons blow things up. 
 We can totally do that. 
 No, I believe I said... 
 Here's how we're gonna do it. 
 First, we make them really, really angry. 
 No problem. 
 We anger everybody. 
 Guys, this is serious. 
 Mildew wants all of our dragons caged. 
 And I don't know about you, but that's not okay with me. 
 You're right. She's sorry. 
 Okay, then. Next problem. 
 The dragons are eating everything in sight. 
 Now, when a dragon grabs something it's not supposed to have, you can get him to drop it by giving him a little scratch just below the chin. 
 Eh, no, no, no, no. 
 Maybe that works for you and Toothless, but Hookfang and me, we do things a little different. 
 When I want this big boy to do something, I just get right in his face and... drop that right now! You hear me? 
 See? He dropped it. 
 Should we help him? 
 Yeah, in a minute. 
 All right, we've got a lot of traing to do. 
 But together, we can keep these dragons under control. 
 Uh, can somebody do that chin-scratchy thing? 
 Hello? You guys still there? 
 Huh. No dragons. 
 That was easy. 
 Lunch? 
 That's weird. 
 If the dragons aren't here, where are they? 
 Something tells me that way. 
 Stormfly? 
 Hookfang? 
 They've eaten everything. 
 We've got nothing left for the freeze. 
 I warned you, Stoick. 
 But did you listen to me? No. 
 You put a bunch of teenagers in charge. 
 Now look what the dragons have done. 
 Caging is too good for those beasts. 
 Dad, I swear I can fix this. 
 We... we were just starting to... 
 Enough, Hiccup. 
 How can I trust you to control all the dragons, when you couldn't even control your own? 
 Oh, Toothless. 
 Bucket, Mulch, man the boats. We need another catch. 
 It's too late, Stoick. 
 It took us six months to catch all that fish. 
 Don't tell me it's too late. 
 We've got to try. 
 Of course we do. 
 Uh, don't tell the chief it's too late. 
 You're always so negative. 
 I don't know what it is with me. 
 Dad, please, you gotta listen to me. 
 I know dragons better than... 
 Not now. I have a village to feed. 
 The dragons have done enough damage. 
 By tonight, I want every one of them caged. 
 Understand? 
 Bah! You can't just cage these dragons. 
 You need to send them away now! 
 You're right, Mildew. 
 We'll cage them tonight, and in the morning, Hiccup will send them off the island. 
 I'm sorry, son. 
 I can't believe we have to send them away. 
 It's gonna be weird. 
 I got used to Stormfly's face being the first thing I see every morning. 
 Every night before I went to sleep, meatlug would lick my feet. 
 Who's gonna do that now? 
 I volunteer Tuffnut. 
 Whatever. What time should I be there? 
 Come on, guys, let's get this over with. 
 This is the worst day of my life. 
 We're never gonna see our dragons again. 
 We can't let that happen. 
 Toothless is the best friend I've ever had. 
 Oh, Toothless. I'm gonna miss you so much. 
 You know what your mistake was? 
 Thinking dragons could be trained. 
 A dragon's gonna do what a dragon's gonna do. 
 It's their nature. 
 And nature always wins. 
 Oh, thank you, Toothless. 
 You know what? 
 Mildew's absolutely right. 
 Come on, bud. 
 Goodbye Hookfang. 
 I'm sorry, Stormfly. 
 Now, go. 
 Feels like big, sharp teeth are tearing at this thing in my chest. 
 That's what it feels like when your heart is breaking. 
 I don't have a heart. I'm not a girl. 
 Don't close it! 
 We are not locking them up. 
 What happened? 
 Did you change your father's mind? 
 Or are we going behind his back again? 
 Uh, one of those. 
 Look, the dragons are gonna do what they're gonna do. 
 It's their nature. 
 We just need to learn how to use it. 
 Ah, the nets are empty again. 
 Did I eat them already? 
 Did I enjoy it? 
 Oh, am I being too negative? 
 Snotlout, scare us up some dinner. 
 Dragon attack! 
 Hey, thanks, dragon. 
 That's right! That just happened! 
 Come on, follow me. 
 Afternoon, Mildew! 
 3 o'clock. Time for the fertilizer. 
 Okay, Meatlug. Let 'er rip. 
 Smile, Mildew. 
 We just saved you three months of work. 
 That was awesome! 
 How did you know that was gonna work? 
 Because they're dragons, so they're gonna do what dragons do. 
 We just have to work with them and not against them. 
 You know who we should actually be thanking... 
 There they are, Stoick. 
 Those dragons don't look like they're in cages to me. 
 No. 
 This is not what I asked for. 
 Oh, no. 
 What's Stoick gonna do to us? 
 I'm too pretty for jail. 
 Heh. Where'd you hear that? 
 You all disobeyed my orders, and there will be consequences. 
 I told you we were gonna get in trouble. 
 Ugh, you never listen to me. 
 Dad, if anyone's going to get in trouble, it should be me. 
 No, you all had a hand in this. 
 Oh, this is gonna be great, Fungus. 
 It's about to get ugly. 
 You took over this place without asking. 
 You released the dragons against my wishes. 
 Things are going to change around here. 
 That's why... 
 We're getting a dragon training academy!	 
 Huh? 
 Gobber! I wanted to tell them! 
 I'm sorry. You're right. Go ahead. 
 Well, you told most of it. 
 You can tell 'em the part about how proud you are of them. 
 Gobber! 
 Hiccup... well, what he said... 
 You've all made me proud. 
 This dragon training academy is for you. 
 Hookfang! 
 Hey, Stormfly. 
 I missed you so much. 
 Hey, bud. 
 I'll get those dragons yet. 
 Now all you have to do is train 'em. 
 Not a problem, dad. 
 After all, I've got him. 
 And them too. 
 Dragons can't change who they are. 
 But who would want them to? 
 Dragons are powerful, amazing creatures. 
 "Berk Dragon Academy" I like the sound of that. 
 And as long as it takes me, I am going to learn everything there is to know about them. 
 Wouldn't you?
