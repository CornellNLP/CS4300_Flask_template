 1x04 - The Terrible Twos 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 Follow me. 
 Low-level evasive maneuvers. Come on, bud. 
 When you're riding a dragon, communication is key. 
 You almost have to read each other's minds. 
 Or else. 
 Hey! What are you doing? [screams] 
 [grunting] Are you trying to kill me? 
 [Hookfang growls] 
 We gotta go back. 
 I think you missed a branch. 
 [screams] 
 [crashing] 
 [wincing] Got it. 
 And you have to have an open mind, because sometimes, your dragon knows better than you. 
 [Stormfly grunts] 
 Stormfly, up! [screams] 
 Aaaah. 
 You were right, Stormfly. It was down. 
 Oh! I almost died. 
 Almost died? I would have died. 
 Bleh. 
 That's a good look for you. 
 Hey, has anyone seen Fishlegs? 
 I saw him yesterday. Does that count? 
 [dragon grumbling] 
 Whoa. There you are, Fishlegs. Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. Just hanging out. 
 It's not like I crashed, or anything. 
 Okay, I crashed. There, I said it. [strains, grunts] Oops. And there goes my dignity. [straining] [both struggling] Yeah, you're pretty stuck. Think I know how to get you down, uh, but you have to stay perfectly still. Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? Wait a second. What does my lack of pants have to do... Oooh! [grunts] [Toothless grumbles] Thank you. I believe those are mine. Now, what are we gonna do about Meat... lug? Can you not tell the others that Meatlug broke the trees? [whispering] She's sensitive about her weight. How did this happen? I don't know, I was just flying along, taking notes on the flora and the fauna... typical guy stuff... then something weird jumped out of the bushes. It was like a... like a flaming squirrel. Really? A flaming squirrel? Or a chipmunk. Or some other flammable rodent. I don't know, Hiccup. It scared us. Isn't that enough for you? [Meatlug growls] Did you hear that? A flaming squirrel. Everyone knows there's no such thing as a... flaming squirrel! Whoa! You saw that, right? [creature purrs] Hey, little guy. Who are you? [creature growls, snaps] Ooh, settle down, big fella. Never seen anything like it. [Toothless growls] You're not helping. You know, I think we may have discovered a new species here. Whoa! Hey, Toothless. [Toothless growls] What has gotten into you? Looks like he's hurt. Don't be afraid. I'm a friend. [creature chuffs] Here. It's okay. It's just a little dragon nip. [creature sniffs] [Toothless growls] [creature yaps] Hey, come on. Play nice. Ah! Little dragon, big claws. Come on, let's go. We'll fix you right up. [creature squeals] This is so exciting! It's a whole new species. Doesn't look like a flaming squirrel to me. We have no idea what it's capable of. [creature growls] There's no telling what it might do. Flame. Do it. [creature growls] Ah! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! [laughs] Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey, that is funny. [chuckles] Come on, you guys, this is serious. We have to figure out what to do with him. He's hurt. He's hurt? He's just really scared. He'll settle down. Um, new species, remember? We actually don't know what he'll do. Well, somebody's got to take him home. Well, big guy, here's your somebody. [creature growls] No, no, no. He's not staying here. I've got a one dragon limit. Oh, come on, he's not a very big dragon. Think of him more like a flaming squirrel. Don't want one of those either. Toothless, what are you waiting for? [Toothless growls] Ah, looks like you got torched. [Toothless grumbles] Oh, that's his name, by the way: Torch. So he can stay? Well, can't throw him out now, I just named him. [Toothless grumbles] Okay. 100 for you, and one for you. There you go, boys. Your first supper together. [Torch growls] [Toothless roars] [Torch growls] Whoa, Toothless. You're sure hungry tonight, aren't you, bud? [Toothless growls] [Torch chortles] Okay, Torch. This is where you're gonna sleep. [Torch chuffs] [Torch chortles] [Toothless growls] [thud] Aw, look at that. He's made himself at home. Toothless, you don't mind sharing your bed for the night, do you? [Toothless growls] Hope he sleeps through the night. He hardly ate. [Toothless growls] And, you, go to sleep. [Toothless grumbles] [suspenseful music] [dragon sniffs] [roars] [roaring in the distance] [Toothless growls] [growls] [roaring in the distance] [dramatic music] All right, Torch. Let's figure out what you are. Oh, this is so exciting! Documenting a whole new species, learning all about it. Wait, learning? No, thanks. There's nothing in the Book of dragons that looks anything like him. We even get to determine what it's called. Huh, that is... that is a really big responsibility. I don't know if I'm ready for that. I am, I'm gonna name the snot out of it. 20 inches for the wings. That's a big wingspan. "Big wing"! "Big span"? "Big wingspan"! May I have the honor of administering the claw test? [Torch growls] Look at these talons. They're razor-like. "Sharp claw"! "Razor feet"! "Razor sharp claw talon feet"! Hold on. Is he serious? You know what's next, don't you? No, not really. Only the single most important test to determine a dragon's reaction to eels... The eel reaction test. [dragons growl] [Torch chuffs] [Torch sniffs] He ate it! He ate the eel! "Eel eater"! Come on, that's perfect. Fishlegs, has there ever been a dragon who wasn't afraid of... Never in recorded history. We're in uncharted waters, my friend. [Torch chortles] You hear that, Torch? You're one of a kind. Now we need to get it to fly. Maybe if Torch saw Toothless fly. Toothless! Let's take a ride, bud. [Toothless grumbles] Toothless! [laughs] So much for the dragon trainer. We've got this. [Torch chirps] Watch and learn. Hookfang! Aah! [screams] [grunts] Oooh! Aah! Whoa. [panting] Okay, your turn. But don't think you have to live up to that. What's he doing? I think something's wrong. Oh, man, we broke him! Maybe he can't fly. Oh, my dear! You are one incredible little dragon. Whoa. Look at that burn mark. Huh, and look at this burn mark. Did you see how it flew? It spun like... like a typhoon. And he came back just like a boomerang. "Hot spinner." "Flaming come-backer." No. "Typhoomerang." "Typhoomerang"? Nah, I don't get it. 
 
 Okay, Torch, hold still. I'm trying to draw you. You're getting your own chapter. Rowr! [Torch growls] Rowr! Rowr! [Torch growls] Rowr! [Torch growls] Rowr! Rowr! Rowr! [roaring in the distance] Toothless, look what you did. [Toothless growls] And now I've got to get more charcoal. Toothless, you behave yourself while I'm gone. [Toothless grumbles] Hey, it's okay, big guy. I'll be right back. [Toothless growls] [roaring in the distance] [Toothless roars] [grunts] Toothless! [coughing] [Torch grumbles] What... what is going on here? Toothless, why did you do this? What is wrong with you? [Toothless growls] Toothless, wait! It's okay, big guy. He's starting to worry me too. [dramatic music] [baby dragons growling] [leaves rustling] [boar grunting] [baby dragons yelp] [dragon roars] [boar screeches] [dragon roars] It's weird. It's like Toothless is jealous. Which is great, so... my first girlfriend is a dragon. Another thing we have in common. Something must be going on under the surface. Dragons are complex creatures, Hiccup. They operate on many emotional levels. Me? I've only got the one. [Toothless roars] Whoa, okay, Toothless! [Toothless growls] You see, this is what I've been talking about. [Toothless roars] Toothless, settle down. [Torch squeals] [Toothless roars] Gobber, grab him! [laughs] You want to dance, big boy? 'Cause I've got my dancing shoe on. [Torch screeches] Gotcha! Whoa, whoa! Oh! [grunting] My panpipes! Now I can get the band back together. [Toothless roars] Toothless! Back down. [Toothless grumbles] [panpipes playing] Not helping. Sorry. I don't know what's gotten into you, but I don't like it. [Toothless grumbles] [panpipes playing] What? Whoa! Whoa! Toothless! The cove is this way. Where are you going? [grunts] No! You're going to the cove. [Toothless roars] Okay, you've got to stay here. [Toothless grumbles] I never thought bringing Torch home would lead to this. I've got to separate you two until I can figure this out. [Toothless grumbles] Toothless, this is serious. You've got to stay here. [Toothless growls] Okay. A crazy, out-of-control dragon blocking my way out. Huh! Or not. [Toothless screeches] [sighs] [Toothless grumbles] [Toothless roars] [Torch snores] [Toothless snorts] [roaring in the distance] [suspenseful music] [dragon roars] [big steps rumbling] [Toothless roars] [roaring] You did the right thing with Toothless. He'll snap out of it. Yeah, but what if he doesn't? Then you won't have a dragon to ride, and if you don't have a dragon to ride, then you can't be the leader of the Dragon Academy! Ha! Yeah. Then I'd take over. Do you really want that? [dragon landing] You guys would not believe what we just saw. Excuse me, we're having a power struggle. We're not having a power struggle. The whole forest. Ultimate destruction. It was beautiful. The whole thing was torched. Torched? [Torch chirps] Show me. Like we said, ultimate destruction. We've seen that burn mark before. Not this big. You know what this means? Big burn mark... Big Typhoomerang. He looks really mad. Uh, it's not a he. It's a she. That's Torch's mother. Torch is a baby. That's what Toothless was trying to tell me. Whoever gets between that mother and this baby is gonna get fried! You take it. I don't want it. Just leave it, and let's get out of here. [dragon roaring] [Torch chirps] Oh-oh. Now, uh, go home to your mama. Run! You guys go that way. I'll lead her back into the forest, away from the village. Hiccup! [dragon roars] Oh, please stop following me. Toothless! [dragon growls] Thanks, bud. I'm so sorry. I should've listened to you. [dragon roars] Toothless, evasive maneuvers. Oh, why won't she stop? [Torch chirps] Torch? What are you doing? You need to be with your mother. [dragon roars] Toothless, we have to try something else. We'll use her size against her. Toothless, up. Now dive! I hope she's okay. [Torch chirps] [Torch grumbles] [baby dragons chortle and chirp] Good job, bud. Everybody's back where they belong. Good-bye, Torch. Let's go home, Toothless. [panpipes playing] Ah, I wrote this just for the occasion. [panpipes playing] I should have known you were just trying to protect me. That's what you do. [Toothless grumbles] [Toothless coughs] And then you do that. [cheerful music] Communication between dragon and rider goes both ways. Not only must the dragon follow the rider's lead, but the rider must listen to the dragon as well. Because sometimes what the dragon is trying to say is what you really need to hear.
