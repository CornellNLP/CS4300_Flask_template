 1x17 - Breakneck Bog 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 That was pretty good. 
 [dragon roars] 
 [i]Everybody has lost something they thought they couldn't live without. 
 Sometimes to find it again, you have to be willing to do anything... even look fear right in the eye. [roars] Just make sure you don't blink. Where is he? He's been late before, but never this late. Are you sure trader Johann even has it? I'm sure. I heard from Jorgenson, who heard from Stevenson the shepherd,  who talked to Toldstadt the fisherman, who said he saw Johann put it on his boat himself. Well, it doesn't get any more sure than that. You know, it might help if I actually knew what we were looking for. We're looking for Johann. That's all you need to know. [dragon roars] Not to worry, old friend. It'll arrive safely and in good time. Come on, bud, you and me are going on a little field trip. Okeydokey, we'll start in the west islands and work our way back. [dragon grunts] Back from where? Uh, j-just a quick spin around the island. Uh-huh. Quick spin, huh? With enough food to feed Snotlout's whole family? Do I hear my name? Ooh, do I see a salmon? All right, look, if you must know... And we must. Mmm, mmm! I'm going to do something for my father. [gulps] Okay, okay. Trader Johann is bringing something for him. Something important. And he should have been here by now. You're not trading this fish, are you? [gulps] Because it's delicious. [dragon grunts] Hey. [snaps fingers] [dragon retches] [chews noisily] When do we leave? I need to go alone. If we all disappear, my Dad will get suspicious. Go alone? You without us? [laughs] Like you could handle anything if we weren't there to bail you... [chokes] Help me... oof! [strained] ...out. [groans] All... all right. Fine. You two can come, but that's it. Don't even tell the others. Heed my warning. I am serious. Hey, Hiccup? Snotlout told us there would be salmon, and I love lox. I'm pretty sure I said, "don't tell the others." And I'm pretty sure I didn't listen to you. Hiccup, aren't you always saying it's better when we work as a team? [yelps] Yeah, next time I say that, just slap me in the face. I'll do it right now. She will. And she slaps like a guy. It's awesome. Watch. Ahh! Yeah. [dragon grunts] Hey, look! I can't see anything through the tears. Is that... Johann? I thought he had a bigger boat than that. Come on, gang, let's check it out. The fog. The fog... Johann, where's your ship? No idea. All I know is one minute I was sailing in a perfectly calm sea, the wind at my back. And the next thing I know, my entire ship is pulled out from under me, and I'm shark bait! I don't understand. I do, I was three days late and trying to make up time, and I got too close. Too close to what? Too close to... Breakneck Bog. All : Breakneck Bog. Many a ship has sailed into its waters. Few have returned. My grandfather told me it's pirates. That's ridiculous. Everyone knows it's haunted by a fog monster. Fog monster? The legend says the fog monster makes this really creepy moan. [moans creepily] Then he surrounds you and scrapes the skin off your bones. [shrieks] And then he scrapes the bones off of whatever's under those. And then it drops the bones from the sky. Yes, yes, it's true, what he says. It... it surrounded me. See? Fog monster. Pirates. [chuckles] Stupid grandfather. Johann, we have to find your ship. There's something on it for my father. Yes, yes, yes, there was. But it wasn't for your father. It was for you. For me? From who? He didn't tell you? It was from your mother. My mother? That's impossible. What is it? I have no idea, lad. I just know it's in a chest with a Berk crest on it. I have to find it. Take us back there. You show us where you were when you lost your ship. No! No, I won't! You can't make me! I have a knife in my boot. [whimpers] [both chuckle] I don't have a knife in my boot. But no more fog, please. All right, just tell me how I can find Breakneck Bog. Head due East. There's a group of islands in the shape of a man's hand. Breakneck Bog is the thumb. Snotlout, you and the twins take him back to Berk. Back to Berk? With this clown and those clowns? Would you look at him? We don't have any choice. And if anything happens, you'll be glad you have them with you. [chuckles] Question. What are the rest of us doing? We're going to Breakneck Bog. [whimpers] What if I gave you something from my mother? Or I could give you my mother. You know you love her crab cakes. The fog. The fog! [yelps] [laughs] Tears, Astrid. Is that what you wanna see? Look. There it is. Breakneck Bog. [frantic muttering] Still waiting on that salmon. This job is lame. And so are you. Stop crying. I don't get it. We flew all around the island. No boat. Not even the remains of a boat. You know who would take a boat? A fog monster. [moaning] [dragon roars] Settle down, bud. [dragon growls] It's okay, Meatlug. It's okay. [dragon growls] What was that? Only one way to find out. Wait a minute. You don't go towards the weird, scary sound. Yeah, we do. We always do. I hate that about us. [bones crack] Ugh, bones. That's just perfect. [crack] Wow. Trader Johann's ship. Wow. He really got off course. Fog monster. [dragon grunts] [dragon hisses] Stormfly! They're afraid. And they're dragons. So we should ask ourselves, what are we doing? That boat's not going to hold them. We have to jump down and send the dragons below. Great. That's just perfect. Oof! Toothless. Ground. Stay where you can hear Daddy. Okay, so let's just find this thing and get out of here. We're looking for a chest with the Berk crest on it. [gasps] Care to explain that? [bones clatter] Below deck! [clatter stops] Ah, it's just a little... bone shower. And it passed. Bone shower. So I'm the only one who thinks that's weird? Um... Eh, okay, it's a little weird. [scraping] So is that. Okay, let's just start looking for the chest and quickly. That really doesn't sound like friendly scraping. [scraping continues] [birds chirp] [scraping continues] [louder scraping] [shrieks] [screams] 
 
 Fishlegs, I found it. Oh, oh, thank Thor. There was a hand. No skin. All scraped off. [heavy footsteps and moans] It's coming after us! Hide! In there! Nobody... breathe. I just want you to know I love you guys. [all scream] Hey, guys. Need a hand? Ugh! Agh! Ow! Ow! Ruffnutt, do something! Ow! Ow! Ahh! All right, all right, break it up, you guys. Yeouch! Ow! Ow! Ouch! [groans] So let me get this straight. This was all you. The bones, the scraping? That's right. And this was all you. "Ooh! Ahh! Eek!" Actually, most of that was me. Okay. Why... why would you do that? What were you thinking? That I was gonna make you pay for sticking me with trader Johann. Where is he? Don't worry about him. He's fine. [wind blows] Just so you know, I'm not going to forget this. And what's with that stupid necklace? You likey? Yeah, just a little something I found on deck. I can grab one for you if you want. [creaking] [all scream] Ahh, falling! Oh, man. Wow. Agh. Everybody okay? [monstrous roar] Run! [whimpers] Just so you know, this fog, not us. Okay, I'll admit. Starting to come around on the fog monster theory. [all scream] [extended scream] Hi. We're alive. Right? [flicks] Ow! Oof! Can we please just get out of here? Wait. The chest, it... it's gone. I just had it. Too bad, so sad. See you back at Berk. Oof! Meatlug, oh! Oh, I missed you, Meatlug. Don't worry. Daddy's taking you home. You guys go on. I have to find that chest. Do what you gotta do. See you when we see you. Hold on, you guys. That chest is from his mom. Yeah, touching story. Gotta go. Put yourself in his shoes. Shoe. Ugh, what if it was your mother? I hate you. And this does not mean we're really friends. Thank you guys. I mean it. Now let's go find that fog monster. [dramatic music] [metal clangs] Both : Ow! There it is! Is it just me, or does fog not move like that at all? There's two of them! Astrid! On it! We lost it. So did we. Uh, it didn't lose us. [dragons growl] Settle down, bud. What are they doing? They're leaving us. I knew Hookfang never liked me. They're not going anywhere. Look. They're dragons. Yeah. Angry ones. [dragon grunts angrily] [dragons growl] Oh, look on the bright side, Fishlegs. No fog monster. I feel so much better now. What are those things? They're like smokey dragon pirates without the eye patches. Smothering Smokebreath dragons. What? You knew about these things? Well, I'd read about them. I didn't believe they actually existed. So you went with fog monster instead? Guys, can we please talk about this later? What else did the book say? They hide themselves in a veil of smoke. They're very territorial, and, uh... I forget the third thing. [dragons growl] [grunts] [dragon growls] Ugh! [yelps] [shouts] Ow! Ahh! [yelps] Ahh! Agh! [whimpers] There's too many of them. Let's fall back. Uh, fall back where? Give us a fire line! Don't have to ask us twice. What are we doing? Uh, why are we still here? I can't leave here without that chest. You don't even know if they have it! I have a pretty good idea. Let's get a closer look. Fishlegs? Anything more you'd like to share? Unfortunately, yes. That third thing. The smothering Smokebreaths build their nests out of metallic objects. That doesn't sound too cozy... or does it? It's not supposed to be. They do it to defend against attacks by bigger dragons. Wish I could see in there. Yeah, you do. [snickers] Where did you get that? Duh, from the ship or whatever that was in the tree. [grumbles] They're melding them all together. The chest! It's in there. We've gotta get them away from that pile of loot. Maybe we can lure them away. With what? [whistles] [exhales] [whistles] Shiny. [chuckles] What? [necklace jingles] Here, dragons! Got something for you! Over here! Come get it. [dragons growl] I'm gonna make Hiccup eat that chest. Quickly! Quickly! Those things will be done with Snotlout any second now. Uh... nice dragons. [scratching] Ah! Ooh! Watch it! Watch it! Hey! Um, guys, they're coming! Hiccup, look out! Toothless! [dragon growls] Hiccup, don't leave me! [screams] Oh, great. Plasma blast. [screams] Oh, yeah! Snotlout, would you leave the necklace? No, it's my shiny! Well, it's "you" or "your shiny..." [dragons growl] Hookfang! Aah! Ugh! Anything you have that's metal, throw it at them. We did it. Hiccup! [screams] Whoa! You will not haunt my dreams! Because I'll never sleep again. All right, all right, that's it. A little to the left. We're going to have to clear the forest to fix that boat. We're glad you're safe, Johann. Is there anything else we can do for you? Yes, just give me five minutes alone with the three who dropped me back in the ocean! Go ahead. Open it. I remember this. Aye. You should. Your mother made that for you when you were just a baby. Scared you half to death. You didn't sleep for a week. What? I was afraid of dragons? Oh, terrified. One day we were out fishing, and you threw that thing into the sea. How did you find it? Well, it showed up in a fishing net. Trader Johann got it in trade and contacted me. I was so little when mom... you know. I was starting to get afraid that I'd forget her. But now... I love it. Ah, Hiccup. It would make your mother very, very happy to finally hear that. Most people are afraid of things because they don't understand them. For me, it was dragons. [dragon snorts] [dragon roars happily] Then one day that changed, and my greatest fear became my best friend. [music]
