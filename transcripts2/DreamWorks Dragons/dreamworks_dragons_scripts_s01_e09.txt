 1x09 - Dragon Flower  
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 Berk is a small island in the middle of nowhere. 
 So, when we get a taste of something new... Trader Johann's here. Trader Johann! ...we tend to go a little overboard. Unfortunately, new isn't always good. Ahh, Berk... my favorite of all the islands I travel to. Where have you been this time, trader Johann? Oh, Bucket, the things I've seen, the people I've met, I'd need a week to regale you. But alas, we have limited time to conduct our business together. Whatever it is you're looking for, I can assure you, you'll find it here! It's all mine. I call dibs on everything. I've got food of all sorts, spices, exotic animals... Is that moving? Is that one mov... Works of art, jewelry, not to mention knowledge. Trader Johann, is this your only book on Botany? Yes, Mr. Fishlegs. Why, it was given to me by the author himself. Would you take this necklace? It's made from baby dragon's teeth. Fair enough, Mr. Fishlegs. Ooh, I'm even better looking than I thought. [chuckles] [sighs] You okay there, Gobber? I'm better than okay. I'm in heaven. Oh, that's pure squid ink, Hiccup, Wrestled from the colossal squid of the northern waters. Well, how about this spyglass? You know, I made it myself. I know, you've given me five just like it. Unfortunately, I've only got the two eyes. What else have you got? What do you think of this winch? Hey, it'll help you pull up your gangplank. A welcome tool for a working man's ailing shoulder. Consider it done. [grunting] Wow, another sword... just what we need. If you must know, it's not for me. I'm heading off to my yearly meeting with the Chief of the Shivering Sshores. The last man who showed up without a gift left without a head. Johann, what will you take in trade? Stoick, it is but your good graces that I desire when my humble ship passes through Berk. You'll always be welcome on our shores. I'll be back in five days. What am I saying? I'll be back in two, thanks to Thornado. [dragon roars] Oh, you finally named him. Thornado, huh? That's right. Because he has the power of Thor and the ferocity of a tornado. Besides, it's the only thing he'll answer to. Turns out he can be quite stubborn. Can't imagine where he gets that from. Up, Thornado. Ah, men riding dragons... what a magnificent sight. Johann. Mildew. Did you bring what I want? Always straight to the point... I like that. Ahh. I assume you've brought my cabbage. [sniffs deeply] Oh. Take these to my house. Now, now, now, little fella. That's not for you. Away. [dragon hisses] Ow. Feisty little one, isn't he? Safe distance, please. Toothless, no. Sorry, Johann. He's just being protective. Whew. Oh, it's gone. Oh, sorry, lad. That was my last one. But rest assured, I'll find that colossal squid and wrestle you another bottle. Oh, Toothless. Wow. How does that look? Beautiful. You got them just for the academy? Yeah, we got them from trader Johann. We had to give him our great-grandfather's skull. We got to keep his clavicle. Wow. You know, it's about time you guys started taking some pride in this place. Duck. What? That was awesome. I want to take a shot. Fire! [sneezes] Oh, that's strange. Hey, could you have your dragon cover his mouth when he sneezes? I'm sorry, but that's never happened before. Look at those flowers. They're beautiful. Whoa, hey! What are you doing? It's... it's not me. Okay, uh... Whoa! Whew! Toothless, are you okay, bud? Toothless? Maybe he's got a cold or something. Do dragons get... Whoa, look at that. Well, whatever it is, looks like he's got it too. This'll fix him right up. What is that? It's best not to ask. And whatever you do, don't touch it. [sneezes] Well, that's ruined. I'll never get that yak to vomit again. Hiccup, you got to see this! Easy, easy. Whoa! Ow. Help her, Hiccup. She's sick. And I'm about to be. It's spreading to all the dragons. How do we stop this? Gothi... she'll know what to do. I've heard Gothi can tell you when you're going to die just by looking at your fingernails. Ah, that's just an old wives' tale. She looks at your tongue. She says they're reacting to something, like they're allergic. Allergic? To what? To a moose wearing boots. Shouldn't be hard to find... I didn't think that was right. Ah, they're allergic to something new that's just come to the island. But that still looks like a moose. There are a lot of new things on the island. Trader Johann was just here. She says to get rid of everything... immediately. Otherwise it's just going to get worse. The dragons are going to get sicker. I know that this is hard guys, but I promise you, you're doing a good thing. You're helping the dragons. It's the least we can do for them. Good-bye, beautiful. What are you doing? Throw it in. I'm sorry, but this Botany book is a real page-turner. I got to know how it ends. No, Ruffnut. I don't see you throwing anything in the pile. And I thought I saw you buy something from trader Johann. He did. He bought silk. Hand it over, Gobber. Can't do that, Hiccup. It's, uh, currently in use. It's my skivvies. They're glorious. Fine. I could've gone my whole life without seeing that. Hey, how about we go out flying? Maybe that will make you feel better. [sneezes] Poor girl. Can't get comfortable, huh? I know what'll help. I'll... It's okay, Stormfly. I'm a soldier. I've been shot at before. Once upon a time, there was a little princess named Meatlug, the most beautiful dragon in all of the land. People would come from miles around to... No, no. It's okay, girl. It's not that bad. Smells just like rose petals and... We got rid of everything from trader Johann. But our dragons still aren't getting better. They're getting worse. Let's make a list. Maybe there's somebody who bought something from trader Johann but hasn't thrown it in the pit. Yeah, there must have been somebody who didn't want to give up what they bought. If I find out who's holding back, I am going to be so mad. Hookfang was so sick, I was up all night scraping dragon barf off our walls. Yeah? Well, ours is dead. [gasps] Just kidding. But he's really not that fun anymore. He just sits there. He won't blow anything up. [dragon roaring] Hiccup, put this in the Book of Dragons. Never fly on a stomach full of undercooked mutton. The Shivering Shores will never be the same. What is it, Hiccup? What's wrong? It's the dragons, Dad. They're, uh... They're sick and getting worse. Every dragon? Poor guy. What do you think happened? I don't know. Gothi says they're allergic to something new to the island. But we think we've gotten rid of everything. But if the dragons aren't getting better... Then something must still be here that's making them sick. [distant sneezing] Thornado? Sneezing... that's the first symptom. He was fine until we got back. Uh, we should retrace your steps. Well, this is where I landed. Okay, look around for anything unusual. Does that count? I'm seeing stars. No way. Me too. Hmm. Nothing unusual here. 
 
 What is it? Uh, does anybody remember seeing these flowers before? They were here when I got back. It looks an awful lot like the blue oleander. I recognize it from my Botany book... chapter eight. Is there anything specific you can remember? They're very beautiful, very soft, perennial... and poisonous to reptiles. Which means poisonous to dragons! This is serious. Did your book say anything about a cure? I don't know, because somebody made me throw it in a pit. Then go back and dig it up! I don't understand. Where did these flowers even come from? Mildew. I saw him plant them the other night. And you didn't think that was strange? No. Well, maybe. I don't know. Quit pressuring me. [sneezes] Let's go pay the old man a visit. Well, so what if I planted some flowers? The town square has never looked better. I was merely trying to spread some beauty and happiness. Since when have you cared about beauty or happiness? You did this. What, me? Well, I had no inkling, Stoick, that these flowers had special properties. It's true I'm no friend of the dragon, but in this case, on my life, I was not trying to harm them. [sighs] Let's go. Ah. The poor, poor dragons. Fishlegs, you found your Botany book. What does it say? Calm down. Talk to me. My Botany book says that blue oleander is poisonous to reptiles, and dragons are reptiles. We know that. Was there anything else? Not in here, but I remembered the Book of Dragons  talked about a dragon that feeds on the blue oleander. It's called the Scauldron. In a perfect world, if it eats the flowers, maybe its venom can be used as an antidote, like with snakes and spiders. But alas, we do not live in a perfect world. Look, the Scauldron has no venom. No, but it looks cool. Don't you understand? The book says "no venom"! Okay, got it. No venom. Golly, write it on your forehead. The book is wrong. I've dealt with a Scauldron before. They're 60 feet long with razor-sharp teeth. It'll shoot boiling water that melts the flesh from your bones. The Scauldron has no fear, no conscience. But what a Scauldron does have is venom and lots of it. I'm out. I'm with him. All right, you guys stay here and take care of the dragons. What are you going to do? Dad, Gobber. Let's go find ourselves a Scauldron. I thought you'd never ask. Look at that thing. [groans] You just hold on, bud. I'll be back before you know it. How's my dragon warrior? [grunts] [sighs] I spent my whole life trying to kill them. Now look at me. Dad, it's time. The boat's ready. This is an outrage. I dug up all the flowers. I did my part. We're all out here because of you, Mildew. If we have to put our lives at risk, then so do you. You have no proof, Stoick. You can't blame me every time something goes amiss with your precious dragons. All right, Stoick, what's the plan? Hiccup, when Gobber and I secure the Scauldron's head, Sven will wedge its jaw open. We'll need you to... Drain the poison into this bucket... got it. Let's get started. This is what Scauldron's eat. It'll draw them to the boat. Ah, this is not working. It was a stupid idea to begin with. Easy, son. That's not why we're were. But that is... Scauldron. [growls] I may need to change my skivvies again. We need to lure the Scauldron up on deck! [grunts] That's great. Get it on the ship where it can have at us all! Gobber, secure his neck with this. I'll lasso his horn. Where did it go? Aah! Hang on! [grunts] [all yelling] Aah! Aah! Hang on, everybody. Hiccup! Got ya! [grunts] [growls] Gobber, here's our chance. [grunts] Can't let that dragon get back into the water. Oh, he's a strong one. Sven, we need that barrel now! I've got the bucket. Careful, son... you don't want to get that venom in you. Yes, I know, Dad. I'll be dead in 24 hours. [growls] [grunts] [laughs] Sven, look out! Aah! [water splashes] Hiccup, behind you! [grunts] Dad! Aah! [grunts] I got his tail. Hiccup, grab your Dad's line. Got it! Pull him in! Use the mast to winch his jaw open! Mildew, grab the bucket! Hold on! It's one thing for me to... Grab the bucket, or I'll throw you overboard myself! Ah... Everyone take cover! Aah! Cover! Aah! Dad! [growls] Aah! [grunts] He's gone. And you can bet the last place he's coming back to is this ship. We didn't get the venom. Aah! Yes, we did. Get this poison out of me! Oh, we will. [Mildew screaming] Can you believe we're all just standing around waiting for something to come out of Mildew's butt? No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Isn't there something a little smaller you could use? Probably. Aah! That's the sound of our dragons getting better. I've seen a Nadder spine slice through a man's eyeball like a grape. I watched my own arm get devoured by a Monstrous Nightmare. But never, never have I seen anything so disturbing as that old man's bare behind. Here. Take this to your dragons. I'm going into the forest to scream. Way to take one for the team, Gobber. [Mildew screams] Relax, Dad. It's gonna be fine. [purring] Dad, they're coming around. [laughs] Thornado! [purring] How you feeling, bud? Good to have you back, bud. [growls] A deadly flower, a venomous sea dragon, and Mildew's butt. Three things I never really thought I'd have to deal with in the same day. But I'll do anything for my dragon.
