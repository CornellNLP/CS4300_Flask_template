 2x05 - Race to Fireworm Island  
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 He's pretty good. 
 Come on, Hookfang, is that all you got? 
 If I wanted a slow, lazy dragon, I'd take Meatlug from Fishlegs. 
 [Hookfang roars] 
 [i]Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
 Snotlout! Snotlout! Oi! Oi! Oi! What is with him? I heard that ever since Alvin and the Whispering Deaths attacked, he's been training nonstop. I heard he has been flying all night for the past week. Yeah? Well, I heard gothi can debone a yak just by looking at it. Well, I heard if you sit on a Terrible Terror, you can make flames come out of your... Whoa! What does this have to do with Snotlout? Oh. I thought we were playing the "I heard" game. And by the way, "Terrible Terror" thing... totally true. I've tried. That's right. You just saw what you just saw. Mwah, mwah. [Hookfang groans] Snotlout, Hookfang looks pretty tired. I think you might be pushing him too hard. You say "pushing," I say "challenging." Hookfang doesn't need rest. He's a warrior. And we warriors live for the thrill of battle. It's like my Dad always says... Take a bath, Snotlout? Rip your tongue out, Snotlout? Stick your head up a yak's... No! No! None of those. He says, "rest is for the weak." And let's all thank Snotlout for that inspirational speech. You're welcome. Now, let's get on with this exercise, unless you guys are too tired. Snotlout! Snotlout! Oi! Oi! Oi! I can name one thing I'm tired of. Okay, guys, Alvin wants Berk for himself. And now he has dragons. If he can train them to fight, we'll have to battle dragon-riding Outcast soldiers up here. Up where? Here, in the sky... on... on your dragon. Well, I say, "bring it on, Alvin." Okay, Astrid, for this training exercise, you and Stormfly will act as our bad dragon. Stormfly, battle ready! [Stormfly hisses] The rest of you, make sure you don't get caught. She touches you, you're out. Now, that is how a highly maneuverable Boulder-class Gronckle does it. Good girl. [gasps] Yeah. Looked great from up here. You're both out. Don't let her get you down, Meatlug. You still have the biggest heart out here. [birds chirping] I told you this would work. [chuckles] Yeah. She's staring right at us and doesn't even know we're here. [chuckling] Shh, quiet. Out and out. Who's she talking to? Can't be us. Shh! Shh! You might as well give up now. Wow. You sound just like Alvin. Come on, bud, let's see how she does when the lights go out. [sighs] Hiccup, you're so predictable. Toothless, you know what to do. [Toothless roars] Astrid... so predictable. Huh? She's not going to be too pleased with this, is she? No! Okay, Hookfang, let's show 'em who's the true king of the skies. Flames! [Hookfang sputters] Uh, Hookfang, I said "flames"! [Hookfang sputters] And out. [helmet clangs] Come on! Stop being stubborn. [Hookfang coughs] Flame up! [Hookfang coughs] Flame up! [Hookfang groans] What? What's the matter with everyone? [chuckles] Never seen a stubborn dragon before? Snotlout, that wasn't stubbornness. There's something wrong with Hookfang. He couldn't flame up. No. Hookfang didn't want to flame up. There's a difference. He's bored with your dumb exercise, and he can flame up whenever he wants! Okay, how about now? Nah. He doesn't feel like it now. Snotlout, we really need to check Hookfang, and we should probably do it now. Fine. Be my guest, but there's nothing wrong with my dragon. All right. No fire... check. Pale coloration... [Hookfang growls] Check. Flaking scales... check. See? He's fine. Checks are good, right? Totally. [Hookfang moans weakly] Hiccup, any one of those symptoms would not be good, but together, really not good. So what are you saying? According to the Book of Dragons, a Monstrous Nightmare can lose its ability to generate flame. But why? Lots of reasons... old age, injury, exhaustion. Pushed too hard by his stubborn rider. I heard that. And I always work him this hard. So he's a little low on flame. What's the cure? That's the thing with Stoker-class dragons. Once they lose their flaming ability, they become completely defenseless and... What are you saying, Fishlegs? I'm saying Hookfang is in trouble. And we need to do something now! Hookfang, don't listen to those guys. They don't know what they're talking about. You're Hookfang. You're a warrior... indestructible, like me. [Hookfang growls weakly] Right? [water splashes] Snotlout! Oh, hey, Dad. Didn't expect you home so soon. Have you seen my spare bludgeon? Uh, no, I haven't. I could've sworn I left it here. You want to borrow mine? Yeah. I have to get back to the port. We're having a contest to see whose skull is strongest. [laughs] [chuckles] Sounds fun. [Hookfang groans] Troubles with the lizard, son? What? Him? Oh, he's fine. Just resting. You know what I say about rest? Both : Rest is for the weak. [chuckles nervously] It's just a break, you know, from annihilating stuff all day. Isn't that right, Hookfang? [Hookfang growls softly] [chuckles] He's roaring on the inside. [dragons roaring] You know, boy-o, as Viking warriors, if our swords are not cutting properly, we sharpen them. But if our sword cannot be sharpened any longer... [metal clangs] We get a new sword. Thanks for the bludgeon. Don't worry, Snotlout. We'll get to the bottom of this. I promise. I'm not worried. [Hookfang groans] Whoa. Are you crying? What's that like? Crying? Ow! That's ridiculous. Ha! There's dust in my eyes. Can't you see how dusty it is in here, guys, right? Snotlout, there is nothing wrong with being upset. It just means you care. All right, um, let's just pretend for a minute that I did, well, care. How would I know? I mean, how would you know? Well, you might feel a tightness in your chest. You might get a little shaky. Your eyes might get watery. Yeah, I'm gonna go with dust... [chuckles] for now. Hiccup, here's something from the Bork papers regarding reigniting a Stoker-class dragon's flame. Fireworm dragons. Or as Bork referred to them, the flame eaters. "Flame eaters." We should be flame eaters. Cool! Ow! Fireworms are Stoker-class dragons too. There must be something in them that can help reignite the Monstrous Nightmare. Okay, Astrid, the twins, and I will round up as many Fireworms as we can find. Fishlegs, keep reading. What about me? You stay with your dragon. He needs you. It's part of caring. 
 
 [Fireworms chittering] Here, Fireworms. [whistles, smooches] Here, Fireworm. Caw! Caw! [fire crackles] [sniffs] Mmm, someone's cooking. And it smells delicious. Aah! Aah! Ow! Ow! Oh, oh, oh! Ow! Ow! Oh. Found some! [Fireworms chittering] Ugh. Nothing. Well, that might not have worked, but... Maybe he can drink this. W-what...what is that? Fireworm milk. "Fireworm milk"? Um, Tuffnut, I don't think you can actually milk a Fireworm? Oh, great. Thanks. Where were you three hours ago? Maybe we need to put the Fireworms on Hookfang, so he can absorb their heat directly. Yeah. Yeah, good idea, Hiccup. Direct heat... that makes sense. Well, what are you waiting for? It's working. We need more Fireworms now! [grunting] You hear me? More Fireworms! Snotlout, I think we've rounded up all the Fireworms on Berk. Come on! You said you wanted to be a flame eater. I did, didn't I? Okay. Aah! No! Um, Hiccup? Do you really think now is a good time to be focusing on the twins? It's actually the perfect time. They just gave me an idea. I-I-I don't say this often, but you two are geniuses. [scoffs] Like we don't know that. What are you doing, Hiccup? Shouldn't you be figuring out how to save my dragon? I am. As Ruff and Tuff so astutely discovered, Fireworms get brighter the closer they are to one another. Wow. That's pretty cool. Whoa. We discovered that? Yes. Yes, you did. Yes! Oh, yeah! So, if I'm right, the closer we get to more Fireworms, then... Come on! Come on, Tuff, lead us home. We'll all burst into flames. Yes! Geniuses! No, actually, the closer we get, the brighter the Fireworms will glow... inside this. Much less fun than bursting into flames. Wait a minute. I thought you said there were no more Fireworms on the island. There aren't on this island, but there are plenty on Fireworm island. Fireworm island? That's where these little guys are going to lead us. [Hookfang groans] Come on, Hookfang. You got to dig deep. I know you've got some fight left in you. [Hookfang snorts] Come on, Hookfang. [Hookfang roars] Yes, that's it! Yes, Hookfang, yes! [dramatic music] Bank right, bud. It's brighter this way. [dragons snarling] Hang in there, Hookfang. We'll find more Fireworms. I promise. [Hookfang snorts] Are you getting anything? No. Nothing yet. Hiccup, Hookfang is getting weaker without his flame. I'm afraid he won't be able to fly much longer. I know. We don't have much time. [Hookfang groans softly] Hookfang is losing too much strength. We're gonna have to head back. No! We have to keep going. Fishlegs is right, Snotlout. He's losing too much altitude. It's not safe. Come on, boy, keep fighting. We should turn back. Guys, look. I-I see it! That's got to be it... Fireworm island. They must be inside here. Snotlout, I think you need to stay behind with Hookfang. Astrid and I will bring the Fireworms back. No. It's my fault, Hiccup. I did this to Hookfang. I'm gonna save him. Hiccup, we'll stay behind with Hookfang. You better hurry. Come on. What is that? I think it's a nest. [growling] Flame eaters... that's what Bork meant. Those firecombs are filled with the gel. Eating it gives Fireworms their heat. Whatever you do, please don't tell the twins about this. We have to be careful not to disturb the nest. Make sure you don't touch a... [thump] Snotlout, no! This is gonna save Hookfang! I got it. [dragon roars] What was that? [Fireworm queen roars] Uh, that would be the mother... the Fireworm queen. [Fireworm queen roars] [Toothless snarls] No, Toothless! She's just protecting her nest. We are the intruders here. Uh, Snotlout, I'm thinking you should probably put that back. No, this is the only way to save Hookfang, and I'm not giving it up. [Fireworm queen shrieks] Come on, bud. That queen is not happy. Okay, bud, get us out of here. [Fireworm queen screeches] Wait. Where'd she go? I think we lost her. There's no time to worry about that now. She's out of our way, and the exit is up ahead. [Fireworm queen roars] And she took a shortcut. There's no way out! Astrid! Stormfly! We'll handle the queen. You get to Hookfang. I got it, Hookfang! I got it! You need to eat this right away. [Hookfang sniffs, snorts] [Fireworm queen roars] What are you waiting for, Hookfang? Eat it! Eat it! If you want to get to my dragon, you have to go through me! No! What are you doing, Hookfang? You need to eat that! Snotlout, he's protecting you. He's doing for you what you were willing to do for him. [Fireworm queen snarls] Hookfang! [Fireworm queen growls] No! Ugh! Hiccup! [Fireworm queen snarls] Hookfang... Oh, no. [Hookfang groans weakly] I'm right here with you. You're not just another sword, Hookfang. Huh. That's weird. He's really hot. [Hookfang roars] Hookfang, you're back! Feel his skin. The gel... it's regenerating. Her venom must have started it up again. She saved him. [Fireworm queen growls] [Hookfang roars] Hey, looks like you got some dust in your eyes. Yeah, I did. [chuckles] Stupid dust. Where is he? Why are we always waiting for him? There he is. Okay, good. We're all here. Snotlout, you and Hookfang are the evil dragon this time. Actually, I thought we'd sit this one out. Maybe go on a nice flight, take in the sights. I just want to make sure that he's well rested. I thought your Dad says, "rest is for the weak"? Turns out my Dad knows absolutely nothing about dragons. I just want to take it easy until Hookfang is back to his old self. Aah! Hookfang, no! Stupid dragon! Okay, good. Back to his old self. Shall we?
