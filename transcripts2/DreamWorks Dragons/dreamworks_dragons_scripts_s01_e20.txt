 1x20 - We are Family part 2 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 He's pretty good. 
 Previously on Dragons... 
 Bork week has begun. 
 Everything Bork wrote is in these notes. This is an island... filled with Night Furies. To find this island, we have to find Bork's cave? It's a map... to the Isle of Night! Bork was right. Go get him, Toothless! Toothless... no! You believed our Bork notes. You followed the map we drew. You walked right into our trap. We're headed home... to Outcast island! [water dripping] [thud] [snarls] Where's my dragon, Alvin? Where's Toothless? You'll see him soon enough. Don't you worry. You know, I have to admit... luring me and Toothless to the Isle of Night, building a fake Night Fury... not bad. Ha ha! "Not bad..." says the one-legged boy in manacles. But turning Mildew into an Outcast? Using him against us? Come on, Alvin. That's low-hanging fruit... even for you. [chuckling] [clang] No one thinks you're funny, boy. Now, keep movin'! [dragon roaring] You know it's gonna keep doing that, right? It is a Whispering Death. [dragon snarls] [water splashing] A Scauldron... impressive. You might wanna cut back its water. Oy, write that down. [metal clangs] It's escaped again! Actually, no. It's right behind you. Changewing. Aah! Whoo! Wow, you guys really don't have a handle on these dragons, do you? Well, that's why you're here. Welcome to your new job, Hiccup. A job? Me? As inviting as that sounds, I'm gonna have to pass. Hiccup, Hiccup, Hiccup... Why do you have to make things so difficult? Really not the first time I've been asked that question. Toothless! [Toothless snarling, chains clanging] [i]Hang in there, bud. I'll get you out. He's not going anywhere. Neither are you. You will help me train these dragons. And if I don't? Well... then they're no good to me. None of 'em! Especially yours. Can I get you anything... food, a cozy blanket, some warm yak milk? [clang] Ha ha ha! Yak milk! [laughing] [exhales] The Isle of Night! Finally, the chance to see Night Furies in their natural habitat! I'm bursting at the seams! Don't wet yourself. I'm right behind you. Gobber and I will check the North side. You kids head south. If we find anything, you'll hear it from Thornado. All right, this place is gonna be crawling with Night Furies, so let's fly low till we get a sense of where Hiccup might be and how many Night Furies there are. Alvin, I gave you what you wanted. We had a deal! I didn't like that deal. So I changed it. Oh, I believe you two know each other. Don't get too chummy. Mildew's hours are numbered. Much like you and the Night Fury. [baa] Oh! No! What are you doing with me Fungus? Preparing your final meal. It's lamb. [gasps] Fungus! No! [voice fading] Berkians. Still as dumb as the day I left. What have I done? Night Fury. Let's check it out! Uh... guys, this isn't a... Night Fury! But it's very realistic. Yeah. Good thing we came along when we did. What were you thinking? If that was Toothless, you could have killed him! Yeah, well, if my chicken had horns, he'd be my yak. And if I were weak and girly, I'd be my brother. Yeah! Wait. What? We saw the Zippleback fire from the sky. Did you find something? We did. A fake Night Fury. Where is it? Uh... gone? Blown to pieces, actually. [squeaking sound] Eh. Well, what do we have here? [sniffing] Smell this. [gagging] Nasty, isn't it? Oh, I wanna smell. Put it near my face. This false head was made of dragon skin then covered with ash from a charred Loki tree. Loki tree? Never heard of it. That's because it only grows in one place. Outcast island. Oh, no. Hiccup is on Outcast island. [grunting] Really, this is so hard to watch. What now? Well, I just thought Stoick raised a smarter boy than this. You'll never save your dragon by sitting in this cell, digging in the dirt. You need to go get him... and soon! And how would you suggest I do that? By giving Alvin what he wants. [dragon roaring] We reinforced the floor with cast iron. And this one only gets enough water to keep it alive. [water splashes] Boy's proven useful already. You'd be quite a sight riding into Berk on his Night Fury. I would, wouldn't I? I'll have to change my name. What's worse than "the Treacherous", ey? What's wrong with the Night Fury? He won't eat or drink. He hasn't moved in hours! Well, keep him alive. If he dies, we lose our leverage with the boy. G-guard, guard! I can't take it! Please! I'll tell Alvin whatever he wants to know. Just let me out of here. Ah! Ooh! Ooh. That worked a little better in my mind. Rrrr... Wow. Thanks. Wait! Take me with you. You're kidding me, right? No! I know how to get around this island. I can help you, Hiccup. Please... let me make it up to you. [grunts] Don't make me regret this, Mildew. Try a cod. I-is it breathing? What, the fish? No, you simpleton! The dragon! Oh, never mind. Help me with the muzzle. We have to get it to eat. If it dies... we die. [Toothless snarling] Aah! Aah! [smack] [smack] Ooh! Okay, what's the quickest way to get to Toothless? Through that lava field. Let's go! N... wait! You do realize those are wild dragons down there? Yep. [Mildew muttering] Wha... Well, come on, then, let's go. Uh, let's not. I know what I'm doing, Mildew. Just stay behind me. Oh, perfect. A 90-pound boy's my human shield. I'm not go... Aah! [thud] Perfect! [exciting music] There's the Night Fury! Aah! Aah! Oh! Oooh! [shudders] [whimpering] No, Mildew! The last thing you wanna do is threaten him. Me? Threaten him? W-we have to show him he can trust us. It's okay. We're not here to hurt you. That's it, fella. Very impressive. [whimpering] He's just getting to know you. They can sense fear, so be relaxed. [strained] This is relaxed. [squeals] See? He wants to be friends. Isn't that nice? Got plenty of friends. We're gonna need a way to get past all those guards at the dragon pit. I think we just found it. Uh, well... [whimpers] Eech! 
 
 What's the plan? Alvin knows we'll be coming in from the sky. We have to find another way onto Outcast island. Stoick. Is that... I think it is. [Toothless sniffing] [soft growling] [whimpers] A Night Fury... with my own eyes. [roars loudly] [snorts] Oh! [orchestral music] Trader Johann! Trader Johann! Ah, Outcast! My favorite of all the islands I travel to! That's right. Look around. I have weapons of every imaginable description. And a little something special for my friend Alvin. [all screaming] [battle sounds] Whoa! Way better than just punching him. Aah! [grunts] [laughs] That felt really good. Is that wrong? [grunts] Now, where's my boy and his dragon? Remember, dragon training begins and ends with trust... both of yours. [murmurs] Now, climb on. What? [mumbles] [grunts] That's a good boy. Nice dragon. [grunts] Wow. Uh, Mildew on a dragon. This is gonna take some getting used to. Eh, why's it doing that? What's happening? It's okay, it's okay! He's just never had people on him before. [spits] A dragon's hide is dry. The moisture from your hands will soothe him. [spits] [dragon cooing] Ahh. Wha... oh! What's happening? Uh, you, uh... hey, okay. Uh, you know there's a lot of dragon here, Mildew. W-why don't you grab some of that? Huh? Oh, fine. I'm fine. [roars] [light screech] That's where they have Toothless. [dramatic music] [groans] [mutters] [light screech] Toothless is gone. Ah! Alvin must have moved him. [dramatic music] Aah! [roars] Let's see what you can do with some real wild dragons, Hiccup. [whimpers] [dragons roaring] Mildew, whatever happens in the next minute, do exactly what I tell you. Why? Uh, I'm all ears. [whimpers] [dragons roaring] Whoa! Ah! Oh! Heh heh heh! At least that one's gone. Well, uh, not for long, actually. Changewings shoot acid. Scauldrons fire boiling water. And Whispering Deaths hunt from underground. Aah! Have you lost your mind? [dramatic music] [roars] [grunts] [exhales] You know your dragons. I'll give you that. Hiccup! Oh, thank Thor you're all right. I am, but Toothless is in trouble. And Mildew is on the back of your dragon. I know. Weird. [mutters] Oh! I should run you through right now. No, no, no, Gobber! Gobber, no! He helped me escape. Dad, I owe Mildew my life. Getting weirder. I'll explain later. Right now, I have to get to Toothless. Or bring him to you. [imitating Night Fury call] [call echoes] [roars] [dramatic music] [roars] There he is! [roars] Toothle... [grunts] [laughs] Are you okay, bud? Oh, I am so sorry, Toothless. This was all my fault. Whoa. What's the matter, bud? Hey there! Boy! You weren't gonna leave before we finished our business, were you? That's what I would expect from Stoick's little runt. Oh, boy. Hiccup! [roars] [sinister chuckle] [dramatic music] Hiccup, no! We got what we came for! Do it, boy. I'm right here! [sinister chuckle] Now! [grunts] [gasps] [groans] He's down! Dragons, everybody. Uh, would love to, but as you can see... Trusting dragons. This is what it gets you. Wait. Look! [dramatic music] Yeah, we taught him that! We didn't teach them that, did we? I didn't think so. What happened? The dragons saved you on their own. Looks like they took their training to a whole new level. We can catch up later. Right now, we need to get out of here. [Outcasts shouting] [bellowing roar] [Outcasts screaming] [groans] Mildew! Ah, for the love of Thor. Mildew, get back up here. [grunts] Don't you let go, old man. [grunts] Tell the boy I'm sorry. [screams] Mildew! [dramatic music] Go, Hiccup. You have to leave me. He's right, son. We can't help him now. Huh. Well, well. [chains rattle] Not bad, eh? Not bad at all. Now, tell me, Mildew. What did you learn from Stoick's boy about training dragons? Oh, I learned plenty, Alvin. You're going to be very pleased. [sheep baas] Why, there you are, Fungus. [mumbles] You played your part well. You both did, Mildew. Tomorrow is a new day for the Outcasts. [men cheering] I'm sorry this map wasn't the real thing, bud. But, hey, there's nothing wrong with being one of a kind, right? [door opens] Would you come on? Bork week? The parade? [orchestral music] A family isn't just something you're born into. It's also the friends who stood with you. The ones who fought by your side. [grunts] [impact sounds] You know that you'll be there for them, and they'll be there for you, for the battles that are yet to come. [suspenseful music] [sinister chuckle] [maniacal laughter] [laughter continues]
