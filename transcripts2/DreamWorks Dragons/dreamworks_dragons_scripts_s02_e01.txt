 2x01 - Live and Let Fly 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 He's pretty good. 
 Tell us what you know about the dragons, boy. 
 Tell us how you train them. I won't talk! [grunting] You can't make me. Oh, I think we can. Hello? [panting] Is anybody there? Oh! You can't... you can't leave me in here! [hyperventilating] Okay! Okay! Hiccup is the leader of the Berk dragon academy. He rides a Night Fury named Toothless. And there's Astrid. She's mean. But in a nice way. Her dragon is a Deadly Nadder, shoots spines, loves chicken, heh. Snotlout rides a Monstrous Nightmare. We're not actually sure who's more monstrous... him or the dragon. And then there's the twins. They share a Zippleback. Actually, they fight over it. [water drips echoing] What? You know I hate the dark! [dragon warbles] Great. Fishlegs. More like guppy legs. Jeez. Fishlegs, you can't cave in. Alvin will do a lot more than turn out the light to get you to talk. He had me locked in a dungeon ready to be executed. Toothless was chained and muzzled for days. You need to stick with what we discussed... your name, where you live, and nothing else. All right, I'll work on it! Mean? I'm not mean! It's okay, Astrid. I like mean girls. Ugh! Hey, girl, can you untie me? [slurp] Please? Grounded? All the dragons? Are you serious? Deadly serious. From this point forward, there is a ban on flying... period. What? What about patrolling, training? What part of "ban on flying" did you not understand, Hiccup? But that's... that's ridiculous. I want that wall higher! Aye, aye, sir! Are you calling your father ridiculous? Of course not. I would never call my father ridiculous. I'm calling my chief ridiculous. Oh! Careful, son. [Toothless gurgles] You too, dragon. Put your backs into it, boys! Aye, aye! Dad, Alvin has his own dragons... Changewings, Scauldrons, Whispering Deaths... I saw them with my own eyes! Yes. When you were kidnapped and locked up in an Outcast prison. He's also read the Book of Dragons. He's seen Astrid train a Monstrous Nightmare, and he still has Mildew, who, by the way, I really doubt will hold up under questioning. Hiccup... If Alvin learns how to train his dragons and he attacks with them, our only chance is to fight back with ours. I understand that. But I'm not gonna risk your life or the lives of any of your dragon riders. This is my final word. And you agreed? Just like that? What other choice did I have? He's the chief, who also happens to be my incredibly overprotective father. Wha... well, we have to get him to change his mind. Stoick the Vast? Um, good luck with that. So what am I supposed to do with Hookfang if he can't fly? You know what happens when his "inner warrior" is caged up? Aah! Ooh. That... is what happens! Whoa. We should have caged his inner warrior a long time ago... that was awesome! [chuckling] Yeah. Look, I know this is going to be hard, but I'll keep working on my dad, and hopefully he'll change his mind. And what if he doesn't? [dragons gurgling] Wow. I forgot what a long walk it is from the academy. Sure would be nice to be flying home. Why, thank you, Astrid, for that observation,  because I clearly don't have enough on my plate right now. What's with him? Ah, it's sunset. We always take a lap around the island when it gets dark. He loves it. [Toothless roars] Poor Toothless. No family, no night flying. What's left for him, really? Okay. Why don't I just leave the two of you alone? That's probably... a good idea... [thump] Ow! What? [grumbles] [thud] Ah... ooh! Toothless, you have to relax. [Toothless roars] [sighs] Nice to have you in the shop, Hiccup. Usually you and Toothless are out enjoying a beautiful evening flight around the island as this hour. Of course, you can't do that anymore, what with the ban on flying and all. Ah... shame about that. So... what are we making? What do you think? All this work for a shield? Well, it's not just a shield. Handy. If we can't ride dragons, we have to defend ourselves somehow. You know, Hiccup, your father is just doing what's best for you. He's trying to keep you safe. I know. But the problem is, the safest place for me is on Toothless. [Toothless snorts] Well, I'll leave you to it. Imagine you'll be here quite a while. Too bad, really. Have you seen that moon? Can't imagine a more beautiful night for a flight. I did it again, didn't I? Ah! [grunts] Gah! I know what you're thinking, and you might as well forget it. What is it, Stormfly? [distant screech] A dragon! And someone's riding it. Wait a minute... that's a Night Fury. All right, Hiccup, what are you up to? Come on... come on! Ugh! That was a close one. Nice flying, bud. Think we lost her. Think again, Hiccup. Astrid! We were just talking about you. So I guess this is the part where I ask if your father changed his mind, and you tell me he didn't, and you're going behind his back. Again. Actually, no. This is the part where I tell you my Dad is wrong. So... he knows. I didn't say that. Look, you were there on Outcast island just like I was. You know what Alvin is capable of. So you were just gonna fly around at night all by yourself and say nothing? That was my plan... I didn't want to get anyone else in trouble. I was trying to do the right thing. Sort of. We both know what the right thing is, Hiccup. But if we're gonna ride dragons behind your father's back, we all need to ride dragons behind your father's back. Dragon flight club. I like that! What is it? It's a secret dragon flying society. We train at night under the cover of darkness. Sharpening our skills against possible dragon attacks by Alvin. But remember, it's secret. Nobody can know. As far as you're concerned, it doesn't exist. There is no dragon flight club. Hey, what do you think? Aah! [crash] He's in. [groans] So listen, this is very, very important. The first rule of dragon flight club is that there is no dragon fight club. Okay, so wait a minute. Is there a dragon flight club? Yes. There is a dragon flight club. But he just said there is no dragon flight club. No. The first rule of dragon flight club is that there is no dragon flight club. Get it? Absolutely. Not. Yeah. I think I need to lie down. Me too. Why don't you guys comes back when you've made up your mind  and you stop saying "is" so much. Um, I'm not sure this is a good idea. Besides, I hate having to wake her. 
 
 She's so beautiful when she sleeps. [flatulence] Fishlegs, this is a defining moment in the history of the Berk dragon training academy. Hundreds of years from now, when they're building statues of us in the middle of town, they're going to harken back to the courage it took for all of us to stand up for what we know is right, regardless of the consequences. So... I get a statue? [sighs] Yes, Fishlegs. You get a statue. Okay, dragon flight club members, you know why you're here. Pah! Speak for yourself. We need to be ready for riders on any type of dragon, from a Typhoomerang to a Scauldron to a Changewing... even a Whispering Death. So I've put together some training exercises...  Nah-juh-blah, blah, blah. Can we go already? Let's mount up. First stop... Changewing island. Oh, yeah. Stones of good fortune... a lifetime of good luck. I can't wait to get my hands on one of those. Tuffnut, we've been over this. Those are not stones of good fortune. Those are dragon eggs. And leave them alone, please. I really don't want to revisit the changeling debacle. Changewings hunt like wolves. One dragon lures a single boar from the herd. Then the other Changewings surround it... [boar grunts] Hey. Don't we know that boar? Yeah, we do. That's Bjorn boar. Are they serious? You leave Bjorn alone! Clearly, they are. You're on your own, Bjorn. Keep your distance! Their acid is only effective at close range. Not very comforting when you're on the slowest dragon. I'm sorry, girl, it had to be said. There's too many of them. And they come out of nowhere! Wait a minute. If they don't have anything to camouflage against... It'll take away their advantage. Up! Up! What did I say about the changeling debacle? Was no one listening? Eh. Aha... Hmm. Now, where did he hide it? Where is the trigger for that... Gob... unh! Eh-huh... so I'll just... unwind that and, uh... hopefully, no one is looking? So what can I do you for? I came for my saddle. Did you make the adjustments I asked for? It's done and back on Thornado. It should do wonders for your maneuverability. Good. Of course, that shouldn't matter right now, what with the ban on flying and all. And what ban would that be, Gobber? Stoick, the ban... on flying dragons. The one where no one is allowed to... Ah, I see. The ban where no one is allowed to fly dragons  [whispering] except the chief. Someone's got to patrol the island. It might as well be me. Uh-huh. And not a word to anyone. Especially Hiccup. I mean it. Stoick, I'm nothing if not careful. Oh! Catapult. Should have seen that one coming. Much like the rings inside a tree,  the scorch mark can tell you the age and thus the size of the Typhoomerang in question. It's still warm. Which means it wasn't here too long ago. And if you look at the mark, you can tell which way it came from and which way it was headed. Mm-hmm. I know which way it's headed without all that stupid stuff. Oh, really? Where's it going? It's not. It's coming... at us. Right now! So, uh, anything else we needed to learn? Nope. We're good. Hey, Hiccup. Yes, Tuffnut? When did your dad join dragon flight club. He didn't. Oh. Weird. 'Cause he's right there. [Thornado roars] What the... aw, quick! Evasive cloud maneuvers. We have to stay up here in the clouds until we're right over town. What are you two doing? We can't see in the clouds. Yeah. It's too cloudy. [dragons snorting] What in the name of Thor? Uh, you guys, if your heads are out of the clouds, my dad can see you. Tuffnut : Uh, not going to disagree with you there. All right, guys, split up, head home, and please keep the dragons out of sight. You can't all get away! Aah! Ooh... oof... ooh... oh! Way to go, Hookfang! This never happened. [whispering] Okay, come on. Whew. We made it, girl. I knew we were smarter than... Smarter than who... Aah! Fishlegs? Chief! What are you doing up? You're comin' with me, son. I'm going to ask you one more time, Fishlegs,   what were you doing out there flying, and who was with you? My name is Fishlegs. I live on the island of Berk. I don't know anything about dragons or those who ride them. Why does he keep saying that? He's kind of giving me the willies. My name is Fishlegs. Fishlegs, this is not an interrogation. [Fishlegs whimpers] Actually, it does kind of feel like an interrogation, Stoick. Not helping, Gobber. My name is Fishlegs! I live on the island of Berk! I don't know anything about dragons or those who ride them! He put the screws to me. I thought I was gonna crack. Especially when the lights went out. But I held firm,  because I know the first rule of dragon flight club is there is no dragon flight club. Oh, great, not that again. You did great, Fishlegs. So what are we doing tonight? Nothing. That doesn't sound fun at all. Look, my dad is on to us. It's important that we lay low until this blows over. We need to be invisible. Hey, hey, you guys! Snotlout, what did I tell you? No dragons. Yeah. Even I knew that. [sighs] What's so important anyway? Let's just say I may have saved this entire island! Alvin and the Outcasts are attacking as we speak. Alvin... So what do we do now? Alvin, we're getting closer. Yeah. And the closer we get, the stronger the smell. Smell of what? The smell of Berk's destruction. Dad, wake up. Dad! Aaaahhh! Dad, it's me! Please don't chop me. Hiccup! What did I tell you about sneaking up on me when I'm asleep? Okay! It's not fun for me either! But this is an emergency. The Outcasts are sailing towards Berk. And how would you know that? Do I really need to answer that question? I told you no flying, Hiccup! Yeah. By the way, I've been thinking about that. Doesn't a ban on dragon flying pertain to all dragons, even, oh, let's say a Thunderdrum? We'll talk about this later. Wake the others. We'll need the full academy. Hey, chief. [Thornado roars] I'm going to draw their first round of fire. When they're reloading, you attack. But not before. On my command! And... Now! Thornado, down! Fire! Now, Hiccup! Here they come. Just like you said. Open the cargo hold! Changewings! We can't let them get to Berk! If they go into town, they'll tear Berk apart and we won't be able to see them. Astrid, you and the others herd them towards Changewing island and make sure they don't head back this way. I'm going to help my dad. Got it! Alvin, the wild dragons are retreating. Oh! I can see that! Dad! Our shots combined! Hit them again, son! [men screaming] Oh, come about. Set a course for Outcast island. They're retreating! Well done, Hiccup. Thanks, Dad. What is it? I don't know, I... just figured Alvin would have a little better plan than this. Let's just be thankful he didn't. Ha ha! Alvin's diversion worked perfectly. Hey, are you sure we're putting these in the right place? [scoffs] I'm sure. These caves lead directly underneath Berk. They'll never know there are Whispering Deaths Ah! Careful with that! I don't like that you disobeyed me, son, but I can admit when I was wrong. I shouldn't have grounded the dragons. I was just... being a father. I understand, Dad. [Toothless gurgles] All right. Now, tell me about this dragon flight club of yours. And don't leave out a thing. Well, the first thing you have to remember... is that there is no dragon flight club. [rumbling] [dragon roars]
