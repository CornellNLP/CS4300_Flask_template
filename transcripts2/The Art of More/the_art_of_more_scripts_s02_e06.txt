 Previously on  The Art of More... 
 Stop! Hey, you almost hit those kids. 
 Washington :  You know that smuggler you were looking for? 
 I just shot him. 
 I guess it's just one of those days in the universe. 
 Graham : Mind if we do this another time? 
 No, it's fine. 
 I'm sorry. 
 The company's f*cked. 
 The Board saw it. They saw your great hope. 
 Miles was no better and they picked me. 
 Olivia, Isabel. Isabel, Olivia. 
 'Sup? 
 I hope I didn't take you away from something too important. 
 Henry was on a business trip. 
 You have to go, Sam. 
 I need you to get me another painting. 
 Too happy to help you, Joseph. 
 A-ha! 
 I told you, I didn't care about the money. 
 Silas :  You need a wake-up call, Arthur. 
 You m*therf*cker! 
 I was wondering if you could find someone to purchase another of my Rubens. 
 At the same elevated price, of course. 
 Just give me his name and you can leave this room. 
 The name of your buyer. 
 Samuel Brukner... is my buyer. 
 (overlapping chatter) 
 Man : Oh, you never know what you're going to find. 
 You never know. 
 Ah, it's right here. 
 Man 2 : Crack it open, let's see what we got here. 
 All right. How much for it? 
 You gonna let us see what we got? 
 Yeah. You can all have a good look, but I'm gonna start taking bids too. 
 Who's going to give me 100? 
 100 bucks. 
 All right. One and a quarter? 
 Ah, sh1t. This guy was a mailman. 
 He's got nothing. Waste of time. 
 Auctioneer : One and a quarter? Can I get one and a quarter? 
 Yeah. Yeah, 125. 
 All right, 150? 
 150. 
 175? 
 Right here. 
 All right. 
 200. 
 220? 
 Yeah. 
 240. 
 300. 
 Auctioneer : All right. 
 Three and a quarter, anybody? 325? 
 Going once, twice. 
 Sold to the gentleman for $300. 
 And what's your name, sir? 
 Jeff Meloni. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Holy sh1t! This is amazing. 
 Cameraman : Jeff, try not to curse. 
 Sorry. Sorry. Okay, let's do it again. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hi. Sorry, I'm looking for Jeff. 
 You're here to talk about the Biggs photographs, right? 
 Yeah listen, I'm not selling them individually. 
 Okay? They're staying as a collection. 
 Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. 
 Alesha Foley. DeGraaf's Auction House. 
 Hey, you guys can take five. 
 We're shooting a documentary. 
 Oh, I love that idea. 
 I mean, Everyday Mailman is secretly the most talented photographer of his generation. 
 A story like that doesn't come around very often. 
 Uh, look, I have been seeing the buzz that you've been generating online and I know that you're fielding a lot of offers from galleries, museums and other houses, but I want you to know that DeGraaf's is here for your needs. 
 Yeah. No offense, but everybody says that. 
 You grew up with Graham Connor. 
 Who? 
 Oh, sorry. Tommy Connor. 
 The Terminator! 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 Tell me you didn't call him that. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, it kind of morphed from, you know, his last name being Connor and you know, sometimes he would get that crazy evil eye when he got pissed off. 
 Yeah, I know the one. He works for me at DeGraaf's. 
 He works at DeGraaf's, huh? 
 I will make sure that he handles your account. 
 It's been a long time since I seen Tommy Connor. 
 Hm. 
 Think I owe him an ass-kicking. 
 (upbeat music plays) 
 ♪ Watch this ♪ 
 Sir? Mr. Connor and Mr. Ramirez are here. 
 Don't walk into my back swing. 
 Special Agent Ramirez. FBI. 
 Thank you, Nicole. 
 Sam, we need to talk. 
 What do you know about Paul Rice? 
 Specifically in regards to smuggled art. 
 Paul Rice... is a smuggler? 
 So you know him. 
 Our circles overlap, yeah. 
 What circles exactly? 
 Acquaintances. He's the kind of guy, he's always handing his card out like some little meerkat, you know? 
 But you never look at it. 
 I don't think he has "smuggling" on his card. 
 Yeah, he's not just smuggling. 
 He's funneling the money back to Iraq and Syria. 
 That's very reprehensible. 
 But what does that have to do with me? 
 Graham's working undercover for us on an operation to take him down. 
 The only thing is... 
 Rice wants to meet my buyer, so I need a big name, someone he knows could afford what he's selling, and not just once, a repeat customer, someone I have a relationship with. 
 Me. 
 And we only have a few days. 
 You guys are in quite a pickle. 
 I'm giving you the opportunity to serve your country. 
 You sound like some Navy recruiter at the mall. 
 There's always the Statue of Gudea. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It looks like some guy taking a sh1t. 
 We know you purchased it illegally. 
 Look, Agent Ramirez, if you want me to help you, you have to give me something a little bit more inspiring. 
 Well, what would you consider inspiring? 
 Well, for instance, right now the US Attorney's Office is investigating me for my relationship with this local councilman. 
 And there's nothing there, but they keep sniffing around. 
 They're sniffing my ass, and I do not like my ass sniffed. 
 So, if you can make that go away, then yeah... 
 I will talk to Rice. 
 That's not going to be easy. 
 Not my problem. 
 (theme music playing) 
 Ramirez : I'll work on the District Attorney. 
 In the meantime, you stall Rice. 
 How am I supposed to do that? 
 If I knew, I'd tell you, but this is your little whoopsy daisy, so you need to make it happen and fast. 
 (phone vibrates) 
 Yeah? 
 Roxanna : You won't be disappointed. 
 He's one of our best account executives. 
 Ah, there he is. 
 Jeff! 
 Jesus, Tommy. I missed you too, buddy. 
 No, how good to see you. 
 I'm sorry. It's, uh, it's been a long time. 
 I didn't expect to see you here. 
 Well, I can say the same thing about you. 
 Mr. Meloni discovered the collection of photographs by Jerome Biggs. 
 He's considering auctioning them with us. 
 That's great. Congratulations. 
 Biggs was a Bensonhurst mailman, so half of these pictures are from our old 'hood. 
 There's tens of thousands of images. 
 We've just begun to scratch the surface. 
 But our estimates could reach as high as nine million. 
 Nine million dollars! 
 That's amazing. Wow. 
 I promised Jeff you would handle the account. Sound good? 
 Yep. Fantastic. 
 Perfect. 
 Hey listen, before we go signing any paperwork, I want to make sure you guys are good with my documentary crew being in here. 
 You're doing a documentary? 
 Yeah. I'm doing a film about me finding the pictures, auctioning them off, striking it big. 
 You know, the whole shebang. 
 Well, we've never allowed cameras in here before. 
 Well, that's too bad. 
 I was looking forward to working with you guys. 
 It's company policy. I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry. 
 All right. Well, hey listen, It was good seeing you, Tommy. 
 Hey, great to see you. 
 Let's get a beer sometime. 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 I'd... I'd love that. 
 You wanted a shot at your own account. 
 He just walked out the door. 
 Do you want cameras in here or not? 
 It seems like you can't decide. You're the boss. 
 Okay. 
 You know what, the other day, that was a mistake. 
 It was a one-off. 
 That's fine by me. 
 Graham. 
 Find Jeff. 
 Tell him he can shoot his documentary if he has to, but don't let his crew out of your sight. 
 So, he said he'd have a copy of the redline draft for you by tomorrow end of day. 
 I also put a copy of your speech for the event at Lincoln Center in the car downstairs already. 
 Oh, and you still owe Laitman and Newhouse. 
 Later. 
 Also... 
 Isabel left a message. 
 She said she had to fly out of town. 
 A death in her husband's family. 
 Why didn't she call me directly? 
 I don't know. 
 She's avoiding me. 
 Do you want me to check it out? 
 Find out if that bitch is lying? 
 Just find out where she is. 
 Send flowers to the family. 
 Not to her. 
 All right. 
 She better be back here for that junket in a few days. 
 And I want you to find out everything you can about Paul Rice. 
 Find out if Smokey and the Bandit's story holds any water. 
 Okay. 
 There you go. 
 How do I look? 
 You look wonderful. 
 I know it's bad news when you insist on showing up in person. 
 You want a drink? 
 You might. 
 Miles was cleared of the FBI charges a week ago. 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 He'd be at work, rubbing it in my face. 
 Yeah. He would be. 
 Follow him. Hack his phone. 
 Whatever you have to do to find out what he's up to. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Brukner : I can smell that. 
 All over the house. 
 Even the goldfish is high. 
 You know, a good houseguest would have the decency to crack a window. 
 Huh. 
 I've been downgraded to houseguest? 
 There's an art gallery opening I have to go to on Saturday. 
 Isabel thinks I should check it out. 
 Okay. And? 
 Well, she's going to be out of town, so... 
 Would you like to go with me instead? 
 Hm? 
 What kind of gallery? 
 It's, uh, like outsider sh1t, like this. 
 Isabel thinks it would be inspirational for my museum. 
 What's the deal with you two? 
 None of your business. 
 What's the deal with this? 
 Hm? You smoke a lot of it. 
 Aren't you afraid of getting drug tested? 
 It's not like I'm going to the Olympics. 
 Well, that medical school that you're in, they will drug test you and then you will not get an internship. 
 (sighs) 
 Hm? 
 I dropped out. 
 You dropped out? 
 Why did you do that? You always wanted to be a doctor. 
 Now I don't. 
 Well, sh1t! 
 Why? 
 If it's about the tuition... 
 Of course it's about the tuition, but you have to have a reason why. 
 I don't know. Okay? 
 I guess it was too hard. 
 What? So you're a quitter? 
 Is that what you are? 
 My daughter is a quitter. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm going to go finish my book in another room. 
 Have fun on your long downward spiral. 
 Graham : So, a little about DeGraaf's. 
 We were founded in 1883, we're not only one of the oldest auction houses in the US but also the largest still privately held. 
 We do all our own restoration down in the basement. 
 That's Martin, one of our account execs. 
 Martin, Jeff. 
 Hi. 
 That's Alesha. 
 Yeah, we know each other. 
 Hey, they're not going to be shooting all the time, are they? 
 Yeah. You never know what's going to make the final cut. 
 Oh, hey, I need your people to sign these releases. 
 Is that all right? 
 Yeah, fine. 
 Okay. In the meantime, I'll start sorting and cataloging all the photographs to finalize the estimates and select which images to put in the brochure. 
 Jeff : Listen, uh... 
 I want to get your boss on camera as much as possible. 
 Do you think you could get her to wear something... tight? 
 Yeah, I'll see what I can do. 
 Look, just make sure your guys stick to the rules we laid out, okay? 
 No artwork on camera that's not part of your account. 
 Yeah. Only in certain areas. Don't worry about it. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 I, uh, I gotta get this. 
 Another deal. Got get it, Tommy. 
 Rice : Hi, Graham. I haven't heard from you. 
 Brukner's not exactly at my beck and call. 
 He's a busy guy. 
 You implying I'm not? 
 I'm juggling multiple businesses here. 
 Jeff : Come on. Let's go. 
 Not to mention the charity boards I'm on. 
 It's just a little tricky my end, is all. 
 I need a little time. 
 Yeah, okay. Sunday works fine. 
 I need more than that. 
 And I said Sunday. 
 You look like a guy with time on his hands. 
 Definitely, Mr. Connor. Wha... what can I help you with? 
 I need a hand sorting and scanning these. 
 We need to cull selects from Biggs's most productive years. 
 I actually do some photography work in my free time, so... 
 Yeah. Great. That's awesome. You, uh, start with the 8x10s. 
 Sorry for the interruption. 
 Everything A-OK for you? 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 You a fan of lamb's head, Uzay? 
 It's okay. 
 Ah. It's delicious when roasted just right. 
 But it must be slaughtered in the halal manner. 
 Most efficient. 
 The lamb doesn't have time to react before the knife severs its carotid, jugular, and windpipe, all in a single swipe. 
 Which means its little brain isn't gunked up with fear and adrenaline, you know... fight or flight. 
 (bag thuds) 
 What are you doing? 
 When the poor lamb doesn't know what's hit him... it makes for a very tender piece of meat. 
 Stop. 
 (grunting) 
 And I know you stole from me. 
 Sorry about that, but he was always paranoid and I needed him distracted. 
 All true, by the way, the, uh, single swipe. 
 (chuckles) 
 Anyway, good doing business, Uzay. 
 And, uh, I... hope to see you again soon. 
 (chuckles) 
 What is it about Jerome Biggs's photographs that you connect with the most? 
 Well, I think they're visually very compelling and, uh... 
 What's this? 
 That's a guy I grew up with. 
 He's shooting a documentary about his auction. 
 He's kind of cute. Is he gay? 
 No. 
 Oh. Pity. 
 So, you say you've found a buyer for my Rubens? 
 Yeah. 
 Your check, minus seller's commission. 
 Now you don't trust me? 
 Of course I do. And it's greatly appreciated. 
 We're good? 
 Yes. As a matter of fact, I was wondering if you happened to hear of any impressive contemporary pieces coming to market from, shall we say, discrete private sellers? 
 Discrete? 
 Mm-hmm. For a friend. 
 A friend you're looking to con. 
 An acquaintance actually. 
 Anyway, as luck would have it, he's come to town and he wants my help to raise the level of his collection, and it's easy money. 
 No. 
 And I'd finally be myself once again. 
 No. You're going to have to do it with someone else. 
 Find something else to do. I don't know. 
 I'm done with all that. I suggest you do the same. 
 It's not going to end well. I know. 
 And what would you have me do? Hm? 
 Get a job. 
 A job? I mean... 
 Who would hire me? 
 I mean, my CV's been a little thin these last... 
 You're a smart guy. 
 You have relationships. 
 Use them. 
 That's very kind of you to say, but working in Starbucks is not going to get me the money I need. 
 No, Joseph is my, uh, my only path to solvency. 
 Good luck conning your friend. 
 He's an acquaintance. 
 It's good you put me on Miles when you did. 
 It turns out he hired a PI in Germany to look into Strauss's phony restoration company. 
 Please tell me you got to Strauss first. 
 Mm. But he wants another 50,000 to stay quiet about the forgery. 
 You okay with that? 
 It's fine. 
 That's not all I found. 
 Who is he? 
 His name is Simon Peng. 
 Chinese businessman. 
 VP International Development with the Jianwun Corporation. 
 The Internet retailer? 
 What does he want with Miles? 
 It wasn't a job interview. I can tell you that much. 
 I don't have that kind of luck. 
 Since I got into Miles's phone, he's contacted Peng twice. 
 They didn't talk details... but Miles did mention DeGraaf's. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 (phone chimes) 
 Ooh, looks like you made a lot of headway. 
 Yeah, I've arranged everything chronologically. 
 Been, uh, been logging as I go. 
 I can't believe this is my old neighborhood. 
 And they're really good. 
 Yeah, aren't they amazing? 
 I wish I had that kind of talent. 
 Hey, I'd like to, uh... show you my stuff sometime. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Of course, my parents don't think much of me wanting to be an artist. 
 Pretty much disowned me when I told them I didn't want to go to college. 
 Like all Chinese immigrants, they wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer or a concert pianist or a violinist... 
 Hold on. 
 When were these shot? 
 Uh... mid-'80s... '85, '86. 
 Why? 
 I think that's my dad. 
 And who are they? 
 I don't know. 
 Now, whereas Ruscha is pop art, I was thinking you could probably go with something more like this, which is modern impressionist. 
 It's nice, isn't it? 
 I like it. 
 Mm. 
 Or... or we could go in a completely different direction. 
 Something like a portrait. 
 Bold. Confident. 
 This particular technique is known as encaustic. 
 I like it very much. 
 Oh, I'm going to need more direction than that, Joseph. 
 I'll buy whatever you think is best. 
 I don't have the eye you do. 
 I trust you. 
 All right, well, I'm... I'm sure we can find something you'll like. 
 I was thinking... 
 I should take you to dinner to thank you for all your help. 
 Make a night of it. 
 What do you say? 
 Well, I'm, uh... I'm not sure that's such a good idea, Joseph. 
 Of course. 
 We're doing business here. 
 No, no, it's not that. 
 It's just that, um... I'm just getting over a breakup. You understand. 
 You must think I'm terrible, using the art as an excuse to see you, when all I really want is... well, to see you. 
 That hardly makes you terrible, now does it? 
 Promise me you'll still help me find another piece for my collection. 
 Of course, Joseph. 
 Come this way. 
 
 
 
 Graham :  Please give me some good news. 
 I couldn't get the US Attorney's Office to back off. 
 You need to figure out another way. 
 I do? This is your show. 
 You pulled Brukner's name because you have a relationship with him. Use it. 
 Okay. In case you didn't notice, we're not exactly Tom and Huck. 
 Use it. 
 It's Miles. I wanted to see if you'd given any more thought to a buyout. 
 Jianwun is willing to up their bid two points. 
 Man :  Two points? 
 Yes. You want to go down with a sinking ship? This is your legacy, Ash. (sighs) Dad. Whitman :  I hear Roxanna is allowing a film crew  to shoot at DeGraaf's now. What's she thinking? Miles :  She isn't fit for the role. She's going to drive the company into the ground. Whitman :  All right. Get me the offer in writing. I'll look it over with my lawyers. (knocking) Mr. Meloni was wondering if now would be... Hey! Is now a good time to do that interview? No! No. Okay, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on, guys. Give her some space. Come on. Well, at least let me make you a drink while you wait for my dad. I can't believe you're actually Sam's daughter. What's that like? Uh, it is like being talked down to by someone you hardly know and who hardly knows you. Well, he does that to me too, so, uh, maybe we're related. (laughs) I'm fine. It's just pins and needles. Thanks. Brukner : Hey. (door closes) No. No, no, no. You are not allowed to know her. Easy, Dad. No. He was being a perfect gentleman. No. He was just waiting for you. This guy is no gentleman. You cannot trust him as far as you can kick him. Okay. Well I'll, uh, leave you to it. That would be good. Okay. It was good to see you again. Shut up. Let's go. Come here. Ramirez couldn't get the, uh, US Attorney to drop the investigation. You already have my answer. Sam, I'm in a really bad situation here. I know you think he's just a little weasel, but Paul Rice is dangerous. You already know my terms. He's a terrorist. He works for the SICA. They don't mess around. Graham, this is your mess. Your mess. You cannot come to me to bail you out anymore. It could mean my life. Stop... making your problems everybody's problems. (sighs) It already is your problem. What? I said it already is your problem. No, it's not. Paul Rice has your name, so you're in this whether you like it or not. You gave him my name. You gave him my name. You put my head on a chopping block and then you come to see me? I had to give him a name. He was gonna kill me. He was... He was going to kill me. I wish that he had. Get out of my house. Get the... Get out of my house. Okay. Piece of sh1t. Ramirez :  Look, we'll figure this out. We've still got time. Just take a breath. That's easy for you to say. Rice isn't going to be coming after you. I'll put a detail on you. He's not going to touch you. We won't let him get close. He better not. (doorbell rings) I tried calling, but you didn't answer. I had to get your address from Ryan. I hope that's cool. It's not the best time, Jeff. What's going on? I realize we're seeing each other every day, but we haven't gotten the chance to catch up, so... I brought dinner. Uh, I'm going to have to rain check. I'm sorry. Is that okay? I got to tell your boss you're being a whiny bitch? Okay. Come in. Cheers. Ah. Nice digs, brother. Maybe I'll get a place like this after the auction, huh? You can get a few of them. Not bad for a couple of nobodies from the neighborhood. We made it. Yeah. You've come a long way from "Fuckup Tommy Connor." (laughs) I'm still the same fuckup. Mm. Nah, you're different. I see the way you look at me. Shut up. What are you talking about? You think you're better than me. Trust me, I don't think I'm better than you. Hey, listen, I don't blame you. Look at what you got. I'm going to be the same way in a few weeks. Ah, it's all smoke and mirrors. You know... I was worried about you. When you got into all that sh1t with Miguel and gang-banging and stuff. It was like you forgot about us. For those assholes? I did. I'm sorry. I was in a not-so-great place back then. Just some angry kid. I don't think it's good for my head to go back to that place, start reminiscing about all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got all new friends now... Oh, shut up. Not new friends. No friends. I'll buy you a couple... with all the money I'm going to make. That's very kind of you. Thank you. Hey, you want another one? Hey, these one of mine? You stealing from me? No. No, it's not like that. That's my dad. No sh1t. Oh, yeah, ain't that Mrs. Radcliffe? Who? Suzy Radcliffe from that furniture store. You know her? I remember her. (phone chimes) Thank you. Thank you. (sighs) You said you had some business to discuss. I know you're selling your stake in DeGraaf's to Miles. All I want is an opportunity to make my pitch. Oh, I've heard your pitch. Your ownership stake will be valued at up to $48 a share. Don't you have any shame at all? You said you wanted to keep this about business. Don't make it personal. I made things too easy for you. I gave you too much, too fast. You made things too easy? I worked my ass off. Oh please, Roxanna. You're an extraordinarily smart person. You can do anything you set your mind to. I'm not denying that. It doesn't mean that you're owed anything in life. I have earned everything I have. You've worked at DeGraaf's for seven years. There are people who have been there 20, 25 years, who work weekends and nights just like you, but they're still just senior VPs. Why? Because they're not my daughter. $48 a share. Roxie, you're relapsing. You're drinking again. You're making poor decisions. Clearly the pressure is getting to you. I'm selling to protect you from that. Now, you have a chance for a clean slate here. Sweetheart, please go and do something you love. 48. You're overpaying. The company's screwed. The Board knows it and they've chosen Jianwun. That was my fair and final. So, what are you thinking? I don't know, Suzy. You tell me. I just, uh, I want a change. I love this. Yeah, me too. Well, it has a very natural quality to it. How do you feel about using it as inspiration for the design of this space? The color palette, the softness of it... It's a good idea. Yeah, we could do that. For sure. Absolutely. Hey, my buddy said you're from Bensonhurst. That's where I'm from. (chuckles) No kidding? Yeah. You still live there? Oh, left a long time ago. Moved to Park Slope after I got married. Yeah. I know people who never left those 10 square blocks their whole lives. Yeah. I'm sure you do, too. Yeah. My dad was one of those people. Hm. I always wondered whether he was happy with his little life. Just me and my brother and my ma. With his family. Or whether he wanted something more. Hm. You might know him actually. Pat Connor? Yeah. There you are. (stammers) I... I think I... I should leave. I don't know what kind of game you're playing. I just want to know who my dad really was, that's all. It's not my place to say. Your son's about my age. Is he his dad? The Chinese? Mm-hmm. Christ almighty. I'm surprised they haven't approached you, Howard. Oh, Miles knows I'd tell him to go blow himself. I have no intention of cashing in. That's what I was hoping to hear. Well, don't worry about it. I'll contact the key shareholders. I'll convince them not to sell. We're past that. What? They're going to sell. So, we need them to sell to us. Oh boy. You have a couple of hundred million laying around, do you? No. But I have a few relationships with private equity firms who do. Look... this can get very messy, Roxanna. Huh? Very messy. Are you sure you want to go to the wall with this? Start making the calls. Nicole said to come in. (door closes) Is that my pot? No. This is not your pot. It's fine if it is. You could just ask. Well, if I have to go to this gallery freak show tonight, I'm not going to go alone and sober. I've been thinking about it. The show could be kind of cool. If the offer still stands. No more remarks about me and Isabel? No more questions about med school. I can't help it. I'm your dad. Roxanna : When did it start? Right after. Right after I was born. So, the boy in the photograph, he's your half-brother? Yeah. Yeah, Matthew. He probably has memories of my dad. Which is fine. You know, he can have them. I hope they're happy ones. My memories are happy. I always thought it was better to know the truth in life. I don't if it's better knowing that he lied to me my whole life. I know how that feels. I know he was a good man. You know, I can't help feeling like I was his tipping point or something. You know? Like he had to... like he had to move away to find happiness. I wish I could ask him. I just want to ask him, you know? (whispers) It's not your fault. (rap music playing) Yeah! Crazy! Pause! Yo, what up, Bird? This is what we do right!

No. No, we had a little, uh, misunderstanding. Well, if it makes you feel any better... I never liked his work. It certainly isn't getting any better. I wouldn't have thought this was your scene, Sam. Uh, I got a new curator, and, uh, she wanted me to check this out. Use some of this stuff in my museum. Ah, yes, the museum. I heard. So, you here alone? No. My, uh, daughter's tagging along. She's around here somewhere. A daughter? Yeah. Will wonders never cease. Yeah. She's, uh, in from Chicago. She... she dropped out of med school. Hm. Just sits around all day. No intention to work. Kind of like you. Without the med school. You think they've got some better sh1t in the other room?

(inaudible) Hassan? Where are you? Where are you? I can... I can give you all the money. Just pick up the f*cking phone. We... we... we can... we can get... get all your family. Pick up the phone you... (bottle shatters) Pick up the phone! Pick up the phone! (upbeat music playing) Joseph, can you hear me? It's Arthur. Hi. Yes, bad news I'm afraid. Yes. Another buyer swooped in and bought the painting I told you about. All right. I'll call you tomorrow. Fine. Bye. Sam. Yes? Do you have a moment? Yeah. I've been thinking, and I believe I can help you with your museum. What? I want a job. You... A job? Mm-hmm. What? With me? Yes. And I'm warning you, I don't come cheap. (chortles) Let's hear your pitch. Well, you need someone who can network and fundraise for you. Mm-hmm. I have relationships with the kind of people who want nothing to do with you. Deep-pocketed, museum types... who think you're brash and pigheaded. And you may not think that you need them, but you do. That is unless of course, you want to foot the entire bill yourself. I look forward to hearing from you. (laughs) (whispering) (both laughing) Tequila. Paul. Sam! Hey. I wasn't expecting to see you here. Yeah. Work. You? Ah, same. You know. You know, I... I was just talking about you to someone just the other day. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Who? Yeah. Who was it? Uh... Oh, why am I drawing a blank? Um... Graham Connor. Yeah, yeah. Do you know him? Yeah, I know him. Yeah. He handled my auction over at Parke-Mason. Oh! Yeah. Obstinate little sh1t. I couldn't agree more. (both laugh) Wait, uh, he's at, uh, DeGraaf's right? Yeah, I believe so. You thinking about working with him? I don't know yet. It's, uh, early days. He, uh, he mentioned you two were working on something together. He said that? He did, yeah, yeah. He said you were looking for something big. Um... Assyrian. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you talk to him. I don't want to see you again. I want this to go as smoothly as you do. But, uh, now that we're clear on who we are, let me clarify something else. You don't dictate how this is going to happen. This is my pond you chose to dip your toe in. I don't do business that way. Now... you have yourself a good evening with that charming daughter of yours.
