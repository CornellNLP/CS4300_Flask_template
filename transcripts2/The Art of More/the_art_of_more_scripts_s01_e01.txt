 If you can't fold a slice in your hand, it ain't pizza. 
 End of discussion. 
 Yeah, yeah, you're talking crazy, man. 
 You come to Chicago, deep dish, baby. Deep dish. 
 (laughs) Deep dish? 
 It's not even a pizza. It's a pie. 
 You need a knife and fork. 
 In Brooklyn, you start using a knife and fork, I swear to God, cops will come and arrest you. 
 I'll take you to Geno's, Malnati's. 
 You'll see. I mean... 
 (metal clanking) 
 Freeze! 
 (gasps) 
 Sanaa? What are you doing here? 
 I forgot a file. I was coming back to get it. 
 Is anybody with you? 
 Of course not. 
 I'm sorry, Tommy. 
 I should have let someone know I was coming back to get it. 
 (drilling) 
 Okay, you stay with Sanaa. I'll check it out. 
 Shh. 
 (grunting) 
 (struggling) 
 (grunting) 
 I have 1.1 on the phone. 
 Do I hear 1.2? 
 Man : We got a pretty good racket going. 
 In a little over an hour, the collection being auctioned here will earn Parke-Mason over $5 million in commissions. 
 Big commissions. 
 Every item we sell has a unique history. 
 And you'd be surprised how many reek of blood and dirty money. 
 Smuggled, stolen, and forged art is a $10 billion business. 
 The big collectors are more than willing to look the other way. 
 1.3. 
 Fair and final warning! 
 (gavel bangs) 
 Sold! 
 To the gentleman in the third row for $1.2 million. 
 Man : That's where I come in. 
 I get them to look my way. 
 Congratulations, Mr. Davenport. 
 And congratulations to you too, Graham. 
 I never thought someone would pay twice the reserve for an old crown. 
 You'd be amazed at what some people would do for an old crown.

 (hip-hop playing) 
 He should be tagging items in the store room, not managing an account like Davenport's. 
 No experience, no connections. 
 Do you think he even got this account legitimately? 
 Why? Because he didn't grow up on Park Avenue? 
 Neither did I. 
 That's definitely not what I'm saying. 
 Everybody knows you built this place one brick at a time. 
 Mr. Mason, enjoying the evening? 
 It's a little early to be celebrating. 
 Of course. 
 Well, I'll give it to Davenport. 
 Keep the client happy, right, Prescott? 
 (laughs sarcastically) 
 Todd, I don't care how Graham won the account. 
 All I care about is employees who can contribute to the success of this company, period. 
 There we go. All right. 
 Is that for me? 
 A beautiful girl without a drink. 
 (chuckles) Quite a production. 
 If you're gonna do something, do it passionately. 
 Is that the secret to your success, passion? 
 You mean is that how I stole Davenport away from you, Miss Whitman? 
 I see the rumors I heard about you are true. 
 That I'm good? 
 That you're a cocky sh1t who bulldozed his way into the business and who will be gone just as quickly. 
 Roxanna. Hi. 
 Mr. Davenport. 
 Mr. Davenport, can I have a shot? 
 Oh, photo? 
 So, what are you doing here? 
 Well, I had to see what was worth leaving DeGraaf's for, didn't I? 
 Very thoughtful of you. 
 Any time. 
 Okay. 
 I think this was meant for you. 
 Thank you. 
 Mr. Connor. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 What did you tell her? 
 Nothing. 
 I knew who she was. 
 She was not happy when I left DeGraaf's. 
 Tread carefully. 
 She doesn't like to lose. 
 Neither do I. 
 None of these so-called art experts can believe that I am auctioning off a half-a-billion dollars of my collection. 
 They come over to my house. 
 They literally drool when they see what I have. 
 It's like they're looking at my women, which I have a pretty big collection of too. 
 sh1t. 
 Thing is, I have what's called (bleep) money, which means I don't have to listen to anyone. 
 Being me is a lot of fun. 
 Wouldn't you love to have my life? 
 Johnnie Walker Blue. 
 (hip-hop playing) 
 You know, you and I have something in common. 
 I was a waiter too. 
 I used to make twice the tips of the old codgers I worked with. 
 You want to know my secret? 
 Hmm? 
 (Brukner) Flattery. 
 Every woman that walked into my station, I would admire her hair. 
 I told her how great she looked in that dress. 
 But in your case, if I was to tell you that you're one of the most beautiful women that I have ever seen, that would not be flattery. 
 That would be a true fact. 
 I'm busy tomorrow night. 
 Johnnie Walker Blue. Straight up, please. 
 Man knows his scotch. 
 Shh. Don't tell anyone. 
 We're supposed to drink Chardonnay. 
 So, what time am I picking you up tomorrow night? 
 I'd never walk away from someone who could help me. 
 Oh, I think it's her that could help me. 
 Don't worry about it. I got 22 million for Arthur Davenport's account. 
 I think I can get you another waitress. 
 You're the guy. 
 Yeah, Graham Connor. 
 Sam Brukner. 
 Pleasure. 
 You live a very charmed life, Graham. 
 I cannot believe that those Cotton Exchange sketches went for 2 million. 
 Well, you can only look at so many ballerinas. 
 Degas's New Orleans work, it's some of his best stuff. It's grittier. 
 What I really wanna know is, how did you pry those sketches out of Davenport's ass? 
 I hear he only unclenches for 18-year-old boys. 
 (chuckling) 
 My apologies, Mr. Brukner. I got held up on a call. 
 But I do have those estimates... 
 That's no problem. 
 Your new man here was just giving me an art lesson. 
 Really? 
 Duty calls. 
 I don't like surprises, Graham. 
 I'm the point person on the Brukner solicitation. 
 Yeah, I'm not trying to get in your way, Todd. 
 It's just Brukner grew up dirt poor, served in the military, like me. 
 I just want him to feel like he has a kindred spirit at Parke-Mason. 
 You know, for your own good, I'm going to strongly suggest that you lose the loose cannon approach. 
 Yeah. No, you're right. You're right. 
 I'll tell you what. Let's just show Brukner a good time. 
 And when he signs with us, you can do what you do best and take all the credit. 
 You see, I've been outsmarting people since I was eight. 
 All my friends, they bought these piece of sh1t pickup trucks they promptly ran into the ground. 
 But I knew that the XKE had a lot more upside to it. 
 So, I saw an opportunity because they were going to have with these bumper regulations. 
 They were going to totally change... 
 Familiar face. 
 You were in the front row at the auction yesterday, right? 
 And should I be flattered that you noticed or disturbed? 
 Probably disturbed. But I do have an eye for detail, so... 
 Tonight is about the clients. 
 Not my granddaughter. 
 Will you excuse us, Elizabeth? 
 Just getting to know your team. 
 I'll expect you to join us for dinner later. Until then, mingle. 
 Your job tonight, keep Mr. Williams happy. 
 And to keep Roxanna Whitman the hell away from him. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Okay. 
 As you can see, the numbers have fallen 20% since Friday. 
 It's disappointing. 
 Graham, have you seen how low the estimates have dropped? 
 Mr. Williams, this happens all the time. 
 Sometimes, demand isn't what you thought it would be. 
 Or sometimes, your exec sets unrealistic goals. 
 Based on our pre-bid registration levels... 
 I've spent 20 years building this collection. 
 Which is why you may wanna wait for the right situation. 
 Let me show you the 275 display. 
 We'll speak later. 
 I think she might be right. 
 Now might not be the most opportune time. 
 She's wrong. 
 I give you my word. 
 Your word? 
 If I take a bath on this auction, my creditors could force me to liquidate. 
 We'll guarantee the reserve. 
 Okay? 
 We believe in this auction. We don't want you to worry about a thing. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 I have always said storm warnings are for pussies. 
 And I have never been one to back down from a challenge. 
 But holy sh1t! 
 I have never seen anything like this. 
 And I find the captain, even he's throwing up. 
 I grab him by the ear. I say, "Look, you b*st*rd, "I don't care if this tub goes down. Do not let the Picasso get wet." 
 (laughing) 
 (cell phone vibrates) 
 I gotta take this. Good night, folks. I'll see you. 
 Sam, Sam, I'd love to talk. 
 Your boy Prescott has already made a bid for Parke-Mason. 
 Let me show you what I can do. 
 I'm having a private gathering in my apartment. 
 Okay. 
 Those two girls you were talking to earlier, the leggy blond and the one with the black dress, the sparkly tits. 
 Why don't you bring them up in about 20 minutes? 
 That's not what I do. 
 No, you misunderstand. 
 I'm inviting you to come up and have some fun. 
 I'll see you in 20 minutes. 
 Okay, new story. 
 You were invited here tonight by a buyer, but he's boring, and Brukner seems like he's different from the rest. 
 You got it? 
 Okay, he's in the penthouse. Go on. 
 "Graham Connor." 
 (gun cocks) 
 (struggling) 
 (grunting) 
 (speaking in Arabic) 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Shh! 
 We're all clear down here. 
 I'll secure the exits, see if I can get the monitors working again. 
 Man on Radio : Roger. 
 You're not supposed to be down here. 
 They heard you. You'd rather I let the other guy come down here? 
 And what the hell are you doing with a drill? I left that open. 
 Well, someone closed it. 
 The next time you bring a gun, I'm out. 
 And the next time you point one at me, you're out too, and I'm not talking about the business. 
 There are guards all around outside. 
 Can we please just finish and get out? 
 Is that all right with you, Tommy? 
 It's clear. Go. 
 Go. 
 I'm a very busy man, Thomas Graham Connor. 
 Tommy. Call me Tommy. How you doing? 
 I agreed to meet with you because my friend in Istanbul said you had a message for me. 
 It's more of a favor. 
 I'm not accustomed to bestowing favors on people I've never met. 
 This feels like toilet paper. 
 Your friend tell you I was the one that got him that crown? 
 Did he tell you where I got it? 
 Yeah, that vase, too. 
 Looks like you're one of his best customers. 
 What do you want? 
 A job. 
 We're not looking for help. 
 Not with you. With Parke-Mason. 
 You don't strike me as their type. 
 Yeah. Yeah, they already said that. 
 Well, then, doesn't look very likely, now, does it? 
 It does once you help me. 
 And why would I do that? 
 So I don't tell the FBI what a great collection you got. 
 Get out. 
 Okay. 
 But if I leave now, I'm going straight to the Feds. 
 Even if I wanted to help you, I'm not particularly close to Edward Mason. 
 You don't need to be close. 
 They want you, so you got leverage. 
 And when you give me control of your account, I'll have it too. 
 And if I refuse? 
 Then it's off to the Feds, is that it? 
 That's up to you. 
 We can go toe to toe or side by side, whatever you wanna do. 
 Go on. Tell them your story. 
 I'll say I bought them from a dealer whom I thought was reputable. 
 I will have committed no crime, but you will have admitted to a felony. 
 Yeah, I mean, you'll lose a chunk of your collection. 
 Yes, and you along with it. 
 Suppose for a moment you did get the job. 
 Which is highly unlikely. 
 You wouldn't last a second. 
 You don't know the first thing about art. 
 Except how to steal it. 
 Pissarro. 
 He was a no-bullshit guy. 
 Spoken like a true art historian. 
 Took on the Neo-impressionist style at the age of 54. 
 He took a lot of sh1t for it at the time, but now, people appreciate his genius. 
 This is a solid investment. 
 Are we done here? 
 A Modigliani. 
 One of his early pencil sketches. These are hard to find. 
 He destroyed a lot of them himself. 
 You must have some good contacts. 
 Of course, we already knew that. 
 You got a thing for people who weren't appreciated in their time. 
 My Achilles' heel, it seems. 
 Asia Minor, 500 B.C. 
 Well, at least the original is. 
 You know this is a copy, right? 
 What makes you say that? 
 I saw the original in a museum in Turkey before it was stolen. 
 You wanna know the guy that bought it on the black market? 
 Look, Arthur... 
 I just want the chance to do something that I love, okay? 
 And I'm smart enough to know that no one is gonna offer me a seat at the table unless I bring something to it. 
 And I know what I can bring to you. 
 Inside information. 
 And an art world ally who can assemble an M16 blindfolded. 
 How many of those have you met? 
 You think I'm full of sh1t? 
 No. 
 I think you're a very passionate and resourceful young man. 
 Good qualities if they can be channeled properly. 
 So where does that leave us? 
 Hold still. 
 If you're going to work at Parke-Mason, you should at least know how to tie a Windsor knot. 
 And work on your vocabulary. 
 Eloquent thoughts deserve eloquent words. 
 And for God's sake, lose "Tommy." 
 Tommy is a delivery boy. 
 We have one thing that the eBays and the dot coms don't... 
 Our experience, our expertise our ability to get very rich people into an auction room and bring their competitive juices to a boil. 
 Now, there's a lot of new money out there. 
 If we can get it competing with the old, then trust me, the magic will happen. 
 Have a productive day. 
 I need a word with you. 
 A first-year account exec does not ever guarantee a reserve to a client. 
 Do you understand me? 
 He was gonna walk. 
 Then you come to me. 
 We'll meet the reserve. 
 Save the cocky routine for the counter girls and pray you hit the reserve. 
 I've fired people for less. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (muttering) Asshole. 
 Hey, Andrew, Graham Connor. 
 You got the catalog I sent you? 
 Then you saw the picture of Steve McQueen sitting in the Ferrari on the cover. 
 Coolest guy who ever lived. 
 Now, imagine you behind the wheel. 
 How would that look on the cover of PS4's gaming magazine? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 No problem. Bring a babe. 
 I'll have two VIP seats taped off for you. 
 Okay, see you there. Bye. 
 These proofs came for you. 
 Thanks, Stacy. 
 I got a potential buyer coming in at 2:00. 
 If he gets here before I'm back from my lunch meeting... 
 Oh, was that the man who was asking about the Crown of Calah? 
 What man? 
 He said you did business in Iraq. 
 He was here earlier. Middle Eastern gentleman. 
 He didn't leave his name or number, but he said he'd contact you. 
 What did he look like? 
 How the hell did he get here? 
 I thought they had watchlists for people like that. 
 I have no idea. 
 But he showed up at Parke-Mason, and he told the receptionist he was gonna come back. 
 Stupid. Stupid. I never should have sold the crown. 
 I knew it would attract the wrong kind of attention. 
 I can handle him. 
 I didn't sign up for this, you know. 
 Then you'd rather I keep you in the dark? 
 No, I always want the truth. 
 And I've always given it to you. 
 Look, I'm gonna find out what he wants, and then I'm gonna get rid of him. 
 Leverage him. 
 You're very good at that. 
 And remember, I took a chance on you. 
 Don't make me regret it. 
 I can't wait to show you the conceptual drawings, Mr. Hui. 
 The Steve McQueen Ferrari is the perfect centerpiece for your new museum in Shanghai. 
 Great. I'll see you at the hotel for lunch. 
 I was just about to buzz you. 
 Mr. Crawford here would like to speak to you about the Crown of Calah. 
 Mr. Connor, it's been too long. 
 So good to see you again. 
 Graham : We had a deal. No contact, ever. 
 I had no choice. ISIS has turned Iraq into a giant death camp. 
 It's become impossible to move anything back home. 
 You brought merchandise with you? 
 It is on a shipping container to the Port of Newark Terminal tonight. 
 One of the 27 statues of Gudea. 
 Yeah, I recognize it. So will everyone else. 
 You sold the Crown of Calah. 
 That was different. 
 It had a reputable... 
 (police siren beeps) 
 It had a reputable owner, perfectly forged chain of title. 
 And how did it get this reputable owner? 
 How did you get this wonderful new life? 
 Give me the phone. 
 Hey, I need that. 
 Listen to me. 
 The FBI might lock me up for a few years, but you know what they'd do to you? 
 You have a new life because of the work we did together. 
 Why shouldn't I have the same? 
 I busted my ass for what I have now. 
 I didn't just walk in and demand it. 
 I don't want to make trouble for you, Tommy. 
 But loyalty is a two-way street, and my loyalty to you... 
 You haven't always made that easy, and I never wavered. 
 So, what do you want? 
 When the shipment comes in, I just need you to help me find a buyer. 
 You get half of whatever I make. 
 And when the merchandise is gone, honest, I'm gone. 
 Where are you staying? 
 In a motel by the airport. 
 I'll find you. Go that way. 
 I'll find you. 
 Thank you, Tommy. 
 You won't regret it. 
 
 
 
 Go that way. 
 Davenport : No big deal. 
 Helping Hassan move stolen merchandise? (laughs) 
 It's just one item. 
 I told him he's on his own for the rest. 
 A statue of Gudea shouldn't be a tough sell. It's beautiful. 
 You do realize it's far too well-known to... 
 Thanks. 
 It's far too well-known to go on the open market. 
 Well, you could buy it. 
 You're serious? 
 Well, you just said... 
 After everything I've just told you about not getting me involved. 
 Look, no one will ever know. 
 No, of course not. 
 I've invested a lot in you, Graham. 
 And not for reasons most people assume. 
 I mean, I know what people say. 
 I don't care what they say. 
 Neither do I. 
 But you mean something to me. 
 And apparently, I'm just another easy mark for you. 
 Enjoy your lunch. 
 Lovers' spat? 
 He was thanking me for exceeding expectations at his auction. 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 We have some buyers in Athens inquiring about your collection. 
 You look fantastic. 
 Thank you. 
 You look great. 
 Doesn't she look fantastic? 
 She's definitely one of a kind. 
 Let's get you a drink. 
 Actually, I was thinking we could have lunch at your place. 
 No interruptions. 
 Well, that's what I call salesmanship. 
 Huh? Huh? 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 Belinda, no calls for two hours. I'll see you back at the office. 
 Hard to compete with a perfect ass. 
 I need to get him alone. 10 minutes. 
 I know you can squeeze me into his schedule sometime. 
 Not a chance. 
 You'd be doing him a favor. 
 Doing him a favor? 
 Yeah, helping him pick the right auction house. 
 (scoffs) 
 And I would also be very grateful. 
 Do you have a piece of paper? 
 Yeah. 
 Just use the back of that. 
 Okay. 
 I am so glad that we are doing this here. 
 Me, too. 
 Here you go. 
 I'm fine. Thank you. 
 Ah, come on. Just like old times. 
 At the press conference, we should have mock-ups of the new hospital wing. 
 Really connect the auction to the charity angle. 
 And the jobs, all the jobs that the hospital is gonna create. 
 Buyers don't care about jobs. 
 Only the city council cares about that. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 Why the hell do you think I'm doing this auction? 
 I know why. 
 It was my idea to make the deal with the city council in the first place. 
 No, I beg to differ. 
 But let's just, for the moment, say it was our idea. 
 I want to hit the jobs angle in the press. 
 It won't raise the value of the collection. 
 I have goals. 
 Goals that go beyond building this hospital and getting my housing development approved. 
 And for that, I'm gonna have to cover every front. 
 Hmm. Do tell. 
 Governor? 
 Eh. 
 Senator? 
 You're too old to be the next James Bond. 
 Hey, don't you sell me short. 
 I can run circles around those young fluffer boys you have working at DeGraaf's. 
 I did a triathlon last year... 
 In California. 
 In California. 
 Placed seventh. 
 Fifty seconds behind first place! 
 You may have mentioned that once or twice. 
 I love the way you hang on my every word. 
 It's beautiful. 
 You wanna hit the jobs, we'll hit the jobs. 
 Just make sure that when your name is up in lights, my name is there too. 
 When the time comes, I will sing your praises. 
 But I wanna be upfront with you. You have to understand that I have to go through the motions with Parke-Mason and the other houses. 
 Don't bullshit me, Sam. 
 I just lost my oldest account to Graham Connor. 
 Will you relax? Hmm? 
 You more than anyone else know that my tastes are a lot different than Arthur Davenport's. 
 So, what else you got? 
 Are you not having fun? 
 Just taking a break. 
 Don't stress. It's a party, not an execution. 
 Ah, not when the invite is mandatory. 
 What? You can't make your own choices? 
 I choose to have another drink. 
 I can support that choice. 
 So, is it the people, the art, or the fact that it was your grandfather's decree that pisses you off about being here? 
 It's not that. 
 I mean, I love art. Not this stuff, but still... 
 What? 
 I don't know what I wanna do yet, but I know I'm not gonna find it here. 
 Well, you should try and look past the mandatory invite. 
 You know, maybe it's really a get out of jail free card. 
 And how do you figure that? 
 Well, whatever you wind up doing, you're gonna need connections, right? 
 And there's a room full of them. 
 And most of them got there through their connections. 
 So, what was your connection? 
 I'm an exception to the rule. 
 I had something they really wanted. 
 What? 
 Something unique. 
 Subtle disapproval-slash-innate charm? 
 No on the disapproval. 
 Thank you on the charm. I'll take that. 
 It's kind of a sketchy charm, but yeah... 
 Can I show you something I think you'll really like? 
 (laughs) 
 You do realize that that is the creepiest opening line ever? 
 Well, I didn't open with it. 
 (Latin music playing) 
 The guy that painted these, Lucha, he painted in the streets of Mexico. 
 His whole family was killed by a drug cartel, but he kept painting. 
 It was like his way of fighting back, you know? 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 I like the way you talk about art. 
 Did that start before or after you were in the Army? 
 You've been checking me out. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That's a long way from Parke-Mason. 
 Yeah, my dad always said, if you love something enough, you find a way. 
 Of course, he died before he found his way, but... 
 Maybe it takes a generation. 
 You must think I'm pretty pathetic. 
 Complaining about being handed something that most people have to fight for. 
 Look, I know Parke-Mason is not exactly the underground art scene, but just 'cause you start somewhere doesn't mean you're gonna end up there. 
 I suppose. 
 Get some experience, and then, you know, go do what you want in a couple of years. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? 
 I think this is the first time since I graduated that I didn't feel like someone was talking down to me. 
 (cell phone vibrates) 
 Is everything okay? 
 Uh, no. No, it's not. 
 That was a client. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to make an early night of it. I'm sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Come on. I'll give you a ride home. 
 I'm more than capable of getting home by myself. 
 And not to burst your bubble, but I've been coming here for years. 
 Change of heart? 
 I realized I may have misjudged your value. 
 No, not so fast. 
 Well, you did invite me. 
 To offer you a proposal. 
 I'm gonna do something for you. 
 And you're gonna do something for me. 
 Great. 
 We gonna do these things out in the hall? 
 You're on. 
 Brukner : Graham. 
 Sam, good to see you. 
 I don't wanna interrupt your... 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 Give me your spiel. Come on. 
 Make it quick. 
 My spiel? 
 Yeah, look. 
 Don't embarrass us both. 
 You tracked me down, now say what you have to say. 
 Okay, well, frankly, with so much on the line, I can't figure out why you'd give up a once-in-a-lifetime auction just for a hot piece of ass who only has her job because her father runs the company. 
 Roxanna Whitman is no dumb bunny. 
 She grew up in this business. 
 She worked her way up by out-smarting people like you. 
 You've been in this business, what, six months? 
 Nine, and I've already... 
 She knows all of the big buyers, the PR people, the media, and she knows how to promote the hell out of it. 
 Look, you got balls, but you're going to need more than that if you're gonna play with the big boys. 
 So, the next time you just happen to bump into me, you better have something more to give me than what Roxanna has to offer. 
 Hey, Bill. How's it going? 
 Mr. Williams. 
 Don't let me down. 
 I gave you my word. Sir. 
 Mr. Hui. Thanks for coming. It's going to be a great night. 
 It's beautiful. It's a beautiful car. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 Andrew, I've got a huge favor to ask. 
 Would you autograph a copy of "Combat Town" for my kid brother? 
 He absolutely worships you. 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 You want to, uh... You want to get in? See how it feels? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Whoa! 
 My dad worked on a Detroit assembly line. 
 I always dreamed of something like this. 
 Imagine if he could see you now. 
 Five million, it's yours. 
 Tell her you'll drive her home in it. 
 (laughs) 
 (gavel pounding) 
 Auctioneer : Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd please take your seats. 
 We are about to begin. 
 Hey. Thanks for coming. Thank you, appreciate it. Glad you made it. 
 First up, page four in your catalog is a 1964 Ford Shelby Cobra. 
 Get the hell away from here! 
 The shipment was moved before I could get my hands on it. 
 And now it's being picked up later tonight for delivery. 
 That's not my problem. 
 I can't do it alone. 
 That's not who I am anymore. 
 Why whisper to the ass, when I can talk directly to the ear? 
 Maybe Mr. Parke-Mason will want to take a chance. Move! 
 Get away from here. 
 (struggles) Get away from here! 
 Do you want to do this, huh? Huh? 
 I thought this is not who you are anymore. 
 Man : Hey, what's going on? 
 It's fine. 
 It's fine. 
 I need this money to get my family out of Iraq. 
 Please. 
 Help me get them out safely and you can go back to your life, Tommy. 
 Or Graham, or whoever you want to be. 
 I got one hour. 
 I have 500,000. Do I have 550? 
 550? I have 550 on the phone. Thank you. 
 Do I hear 600? 
 600? Once, twice. 
 Fair and final warning. 
 Sold for $550,000! 
 Graham : Come on. 
 Auctioneer : Next up, lot number 14. 
 A 1963 Jaguar XKE. 
 Once owned by the Prince Rainier of Monaco. 
 Shall we start the bidding then at $150,000? 
 Do I have 150? 
 Hassan : Here. 
 Graham : Come on, man. We gotta move. 
 You shouldn't have coated it. 
 It could've been damaged. 
 Oh, it was the only way to get it into Turkey. 
 Plastic will peel right off. See? 
 Look at that. 
 Perfectly preserved. 
 See? Look at the details. 
 Okay. Come on. 
 Whoa, whoa. What you doing back there? 
 Hey. 
 Hey, did my office not call you? 
 We're from customs. 
 They were supposed to tell you we were coming down. 
 (gunshots fire) 
 What did you do? What did you do? 
 sh1t. sh1t. sh1t. 
 He was going to arrest us. 
 He's a security guard for Christ's sake! He's not a cop! 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 sh1t. He's still alive. 
 Finish packing. I'm going to call it in! 
 Stop! 
 He needs a doctor! 
 (shouts) Stop! 
 Don't pretend like you didn't know what this was! 
 He needs a doctor. 
 He saw our faces. 
 You know what he needs. 
 What're you doing? 
 What's the matter, Graham? 
 Is life more important here in the States than it was over there? 
 (guard groans) 
 Graham, he's suffering. 
 (groaning continues) 
 Is that what you want? 
 Okay. 
 But you let him see your face. 
 (gunshot echoes) 
 Come on. 
 Auctioneer : Next up, lot number 20. 
 A Ferrari 275 GTB. 
 Once owned by the late actor and race car driver, Steve McQueen. 
 Now, I'd like to start the bidding at $3 million. 
 Do I have $3 million? 
 Three million. 
 Hassan : Get the rest of that box. 
 Auctioneer : I have four million. 
 Once, twice. 
 Wait, I have 4.2 million from the gentleman in the fourth row. Thank you, sir. 
 Graham : Come on. Come on. 
 Okay. 
 How many pieces you got? 
 Auctioneer : Do I hear 6.3? 
 I have 6.3 for this Ferrari owned by Steve McQueen. 
 Hurry up. 
 Why did you let him see you? 
 Hurry up! 
 We have a bid of seven million! Thank you, sir. 
 Do I hear 7.1? 
 7.1 in the fourth row. 
 7.1 is the bid. Do I hear 7.2? 
 Eight million. 
 We have $8 million. 
 Do I hear 8.1? 
 Fair and final warning then. 
 Sold for $8 million to the gentleman in the fourth row! 
 The man who invited me, Graham Connor, where is he? 
 Mr. Connor got called away on business. 
 Is there something I can help you with? 
 Tell him he's a lying prick. 
 Let's go. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 Well, I did agree to sell the crown. 
 So it would be foolish of me to hold you responsible for everything. 
 The Battle of Alexander at Issus. 
 Painted in 1529. 
 It was one of the first great battle paintings using aerial point of view. 
 My dad loved this painting. 
 You know, most people eventually give up trying to repair themselves. 
 You haven't. 
 I admire that about you. 
 Maybe that's what made me want to help you in the first place. 
 If you wanna help me, buy the statue from Hassan. 
 Hmm. 
 If there are no outside parties involved, we're that much closer to getting rid of him. 
 Hassan is an outside party, Graham. 
 He's not some terrorist. 
 He was a decent guy before the war. 
 He knows how to be careful. 
 He's been doing this a long time. 
 You absolutely certain of that? 
 I mean, the man took no risks getting into the country. 
 With himself or with the stolen artifacts. 
 No. 
 I got it all under control. 
 I certainly hope so. 
 For both our sakes.
