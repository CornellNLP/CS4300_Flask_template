 Previously on  The Art of More... 
 Dad? I'm not sure what Howard said, but... 
 You know damn well what he said. 
 And the board has voted to appoint you interim CEO. 
 Graham : The Roxanna Whitman era begins. 
 You're a goddamn snake in the grass. 
 You were never going to give me a shot. 
 What do you think of that. Huh? 
 I don't care about the money! 
 m*therf*cker! 
 The first ever contemporary museum dedicated to outsider art. 
 Everyone will be jealous that you beat them to the punch. 
 Let's get you into one of those big auction houses. 
 That way Rice knows you can buy from him in scale. 
 Graham :  If you want to right your karmic balance,  you got to hire somebody... like me. 
 And why would I do that? 
 Graham :  You know a guy named al-Masrifi? 
 Tommy, what are you doing? 
 You fire Roxanna. Put me in charge. 
 Mr. Whitman owns 20%. 
 It will be hard to get a majority without him. 
 Leave Mr. Whitman to me.

 (WHISPERS) Hi. How are you? 
 It's going to be a good one. 
 Ah, it better be. 
 I blew the entire budget on this. 
 Hi. 
 Well, you know what they say. 
 You only get one chance to make a first impression. 
 Might as well make it fiery. 
 Well, I asked Martin to have them add a little extra flair. 
 Roxanna! 
 Speaking of which... 
 Congratulations! (KISSES) 
 I don't whether to hug you or bow before you. 
 (CHUCKLES) Thank you, darling. How was your time in Dubrovnik? 
 Well, it's never as relaxing as you hope for. 
 Hello, Graham. 
 Hi. 
 Doing a little sight-seeing yourself? 
 No actually, I work here now. Roxanna just hired me. 
 Oh? 
 He has proven himself. 
 Yes, he certainly has. 
 Listen. While I have you, I just sold my country estate. 
 Oh. 
 No, it's all right. 
 I wasn't using it nearly enough. 
 Anyway, now I have all this remarkable furniture just sitting in a warehouse belonging to a friend of mine. 
 I'd be happy to organize a private sale for you. 
 Yes? Done. 
 Done. 
 Done. 
 Martin : Excuse me, Roxanna. 
 Yes? 
 Can I borrow you for a moment? 
 Of course. Please excuse me. 
 Yes. 
 So, what do you have? 
 Mr. Cronin asked if we could get him tickets to the Giants game, preferably in a suite. 
 Do we do that? 
 Well, your dad always did. 
 Well, he's not here. 
 (CHUCKLES) Right. 
 Also, Mr. Hachmeister would like to take a closer look at the Muramasa sword. 
 Thank you. 
 Sure. 
 You say the FBI is no longer interested in me? 
 I let Agent Kramer know I'd heard Belinda talking about buying art from a Middle Eastern guy. 
 That guy happened to match the description of the one they were looking for already, so, suddenly, all roads... murder, smuggling... led to Uzay. 
 I'm not sure I need to know much more, but thank you. 
 Let's just focus on the future. 
 I'll send an appraiser over first thing in the morning. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah. Shunga. 
 Bless you. 
 (CHUCKLES) Shunga is Japanese erotic art. 
 Yeah, Shunga actually means "picture of spring." 
 It's a euphemism for s*x. 
 I know my p0rn. 
 All hail the new queen. 
 (CHUCKLES) Hi, Sam. 
 You know Isabel. 
 I know Isabel. 
 Hi. 
 Great show. 
 Thank you. I didn't think the Schroeder would be interested in anything here. 
 Isabel is working for a brand-new museum. The Brukner. 
 You're opening a museum? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it's, uh... outsider art. 
 (MOUTHS) 
 It's... next wave sh1t nobody has except for me. 
 And this is hush-hush. 
 Well, please let me know if you need any help with acquisitions. 
 Oh. An old friend. Excuse me. 
 So what do you think? 
 I think she's married, Sam. 
 I meant about her working for me. 
 She's really good at her job. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh. Is this bromance still alive? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) I've hired Graham. 
 (LAUGHING) And you're giving me sh1t about Isabel? I can't believe it. 
 What, are you hiding from me? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 No. 
 Hey, I heard that you'd sold your country house for eight million dollars? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Brukner : Wow. 
 I would have paid much more than that. 
 You have got to call me next time you sell a big ticket item. 
 Good to see you too, Sam. 
 Asshole. 
 Uh, we should talk about your role here. 
 Sure. Sure. Tomorrow? 
 I'm just going to talk up some of the Edo period items. Okay. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Group : Whoa! 
 (ALARM BEEPING) 
 (PEOPLE SCREAM) 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 What do you mean his cousin? 
 Hassan (on phone) :  Well, it's a big ask. 
 An introduction to al-Masrifi? Rafiq needs one more meeting, but since he can't cross the border, he will have his cousin speak for him. 
 Graham :  When? 
 3:00 pm. 
 He has a shop in Bay Ridge. 
 "Junior." Let me call you back. 
 Hey! Hey! Card kid! These are wrong. 
 Roxanna : No, Howard, I wouldn't call it a debacle. 
 Oh, of course I'm taking it seriously. 
 You have to know that. 
 Well, we haven't even had the auction yet. 
 No, nothing was damaged. 
 Ye... I will meet expectations for this and for the quarter. 
 I'm handling it. 
 Oh, do you have my coffee? 
 Sorry. I have six calls holding for you. 
 Mr. Kajita from The Japanese Arts Council, Blake from ArtSnitch, two pissed-off sellers and two pissed-off buyers. 
 For now. 
 Before you take those calls, we need to see you in Restoration. 
 The Murasama sword was out of its case when the sprinklers went off, and there's a few prints in jeopardy. 
 Also, the hibachis... 
 They voided our insurance coverage. 
 Graham : Roxanna. 
 I'm going to get a coffee. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Graham : Roxanna. 
 (SIGHS) The point was to get out of the office, not to have it follow me. 
 You're CEO. It always follows you. 
 What do I know? I'm just a junior. 
 A lot on my plate, Graham. 
 Large black, please. Come on, Roxanna. 
 I'm not a junior account executive. 
 It isn't personal. That is the appropriate title given your limited experience. 
 My limited experience? 
 How many accounts did I land out from under you? 
 Look, I know your value, but you were fired from Parke-Mason in less than a year for behavior I can only guess was unbecoming. 
 The same unbecoming behavior that got you your CEO position? 
 Is that what you mean? 
 I have to think about the optics, Graham. 
 I have board members, clients, employees watching me. 
 My assistant up there finds reasons not to get me coffee and refuses to change out my dad's furniture as I'd asked. 
 That's... 
 If I'm seen as playing favorites, I am just giving them ammo. 
 I want you to work with Alesha Foley. 
 When you say, "Work with Alesha"... 
 Work for Alesha. 
 Work for Alesha. 
 Look, do a good job, and I can justify promoting you. 
 Wow. I'm motivated. 
 Enjoy your coffee. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Assistant U.S. Attorney, Nate "Kah-sick." 
 Kozyck. 
 Ah. Yeah. 
 You mind telling me why the Feds are investigating my assistant's murder? 
 What, the NYPD drop the ball? 
 Oh no, the homicide's not the focus of our investigation. 
 Well, your office called and said they wanted to talk to me about items that were found in her apartment. 
 Yes. Well, see, in the course of going through Mrs. Romero's records... 
 You know, hard drives, zip drives, and so forth... 
 The NYPD detectives found several instances of correspondence alluding to an arrangement between you and Councilman Dortch. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Here you go, Mr. Kozyck. 
 Nicole, would you hold on to that for a second? 
 How old are you? 28. 29? 
 29. 
 Yeah. (CHUCKLES) 
 Well then, I'm going to forgive you for being so naive as to think I would say anything without the presence of my attorney, who was present when I already told the FBI that there was no arrangement. 
 And now you have 15 seconds to vacate my office. 
 Well, I can get a subpoena, Mr. Brukner. 
 I think that would be a bright idea, and I want you to remember to stuff it up your ass. 
 Nicole, could you show Mr. "Kah-sick" out? 
 Kozyck. 
 David, some teenager from the U.S. Attorney's Office was just here, and he says that... 
 Don't tell me to calm down! Tell me I have nothing to worry about. 
 Hassan : Where were you? 
 Graham : Okay, okay. I'm sorry. 
 Hassan : You can't keep him waiting. 
 Asalumu alaikum. 
 Wa alaikum salam. 
 Hassan Al Afshar. Ah. 
 Land of the free, huh? 
 Uh, we understand you're willing to make an introduction for us... with al-Masrifi. 
 I'm only willing to do what my cousin asks, and only because he's family. 
 I'm a businessman, and I wish to remain that way. 
 Us, too. Just put me in front of al-Masrifi, and we'll get out of your hair. 
 My cousin wants a finder's fee, $50,000, payable... 
 No, no, no, no, no. What? No, that's not part of the deal. 
 That's all I know. 
 Excuse me. 
 Asshole just wants to save his little suit shop! 
 Shh! 
 What's the difference? 
 We need him, and we need money. 
 I got to go back to the FBI and ask 'em for 50 grand... for guys I claimed I was tight with. 
 "If the wind blows, ride it." 
 What the f*ck you talking about? 
 The FBI will pay 10 times that for an operative to Caliphate. 
 You go to them, you ask them for a 100,000 instead of 50,000... 50,000 for Alnasseri here and 50,000 for me to pay off that dirty cop. 
 Scam the FBI? 
 They're not going to ask for an itemized receipt. 
 You said you would help me if I helped you. 
 Or what, now you're happy to leave my family in custody? 
 Oh sh1t. 
 In another life, I want to be the guy who comes up with paint color names. 
 Autumn moss. Lemon scone. 
 Get out of here, it's beige. 
 Nobody wants to paint their wall beige. We need the differentiation. 
 And you're looking for yours. 
 This was your dad's office, right? 
 (CHUCKLES) I thought we could start by talking about our new online venture, BidHaus. 
 Before that, what the hell happened the other night? 
 We had a wonderful event, and it was a real splash. 
 I'm not your fluffer, Roxanna. 
 Fine. Let's cut to it. You need something juicy to run with. I need good PR. 
 I give you the former, you give me the latter. 
 How juicy? 
 I hear Belgian authorities have a yacht detained in Brussels, supposedly with an undocumented Klimt on board. 
 Blah, blah. That's beige. 
 Give me something a little more... salsa splash. 
 Sam Brukner plans to open his own museum. 
 Outsider art. 
 That I hadn't heard. 
 Well, now you have, but not from me. 
 "Sources say"... I can work with that. 
 Good. Now I need you to bury the sprinkler issue and instead focus on our new online venture, BidHaus. 
 Yay. You got a website. 
 Not a website, a brand-new business. 
 BidHaus was designed as its own marketplace with a wider range of art and collectibles, designed for a wider range of enthusiasts. 
 Lower entry points, higher volume. 
 Items that speak to the next generation... with a user experience to match. 
 A little canned, but... not bad. 
 When do you go live? 
 End of the month. 
 That's fast. 
 We bought a start-up with a platform already in place. We're ready. 
 Time to let everyone know. 
 That daughter's stepping out of dad's shadow? 
 Let's just keep it to BidHaus, please. 
 Now, tell me more about Brukner's museum. 
 Furniture now? Okay. Text me the address, Arthur. See you in an hour. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hope you're not going to ruin my day. 
 That depends. How good has it been? 
 Yeah, it's pretty shitty. Thanks for asking. 
 My contact in Canada wants some money for putting me together with Paul Rice. 
 I told him that was bullshit, but... 
 If you give him the cash, can you guarantee the intro? 
 Yes. 
 I'd be surprised if he didn't want something. 
 Everybody wants something. A me-first generation. 
 All right. Set it up for a couple of days from now. 
 It takes time to get the cash, all right? 
 In the meantime, just keep going on about your business. 
 We'll get you fitted for a wire when we give you the cash. How much do you need? 
 I don't know. A wire? What if he finds it? 
 He won't. 
 Well, that's easy for you to say. 
 When we have CI's delivering cash, we like to keep tabs on them. Now, how much do you need? 
 Fifty grand. 
 I'll set it up. 
 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (PEOPLE CHATTERING) 
 Sorry for the delay. 
 Cliff has this tendency to get absorbed in things. 
 I just wanted to say how excited I am to see my code grow into this. 
 Kerbis : Roxanna! 
 So sorry about that. 
 Tyler hook you up with something to drink? 
 NamasTea? Fuel Water? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. 
 Good. 
 Um... 
 We need to talk about our launch. 
 I need it by the end of the month. 
 I hope you don't mean this month. 
 Yeah, I do, because that was what you promised us when we bought your company. 
 There's been hiccups along the way. Speed bumps. 
 I promised the world a launch at the end of the month. 
 All due respect, that was probably a bad idea. 
 Thanks. Kill the BidHaus story. 
 Blake :  Seriously? Ha. I've got to write something. 
 I don't care what you write about. 
 Write about the sprinklers, I don't care. Just not BidHaus. 
 Arthur : It all looks so different in this light, doesn't it? 
 I think you'll be real happy with the estimates, and I have a potential buyer already. 
 I used to run my toy train across that rug as a child. 
 My mother kept her dresses in this armoire. 
 And my father... used to read the paper in this chair. 
 There's more here than just dollar signs, Graham. 
 Then why are you selling everything? 
 Oh well, I... (CHUCKLES) I owe the IRS some money. 
 How much? 
 12 million. 
 Inherited debts, more or less. 
 What about the money from the house sale? 
 Oh, ah... (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Silas... burned that. 
 What? 
 Yes. That was my reaction too. 
 Had it in cash, as well. Don't ask. 
 He wanted to make some kind of... 
 I don't know, some kind of grand gesture or something. 
 That's pretty goddamn grand. 
 I'd have almost been proud... if it didn't absolutely ruin me. (SCOFFS) 
 Okay. Well, you... you still have your city place. You could sell that. 
 I suppose I could always take a full page ad out in  The Times  announcing I'm broke. 
 Okay. Look, the appraised total value of all this is close to one mil, so that's a start. 
 Seems more like a finish. 
 Yeah, if you don't sell, it is. 
 Look, I know people right now who would do anything for a fraction of that. 
 And even though I want to, I can't help them. 
 But I can help you, so take your head out of your ass and sell. 
 (SCOFFS) Ever the deft touch, Graham. 
 Here's the paperwork. Okay? 
 You have my number. You've got to make a choice, Arthur. 
 Miles : I don't think I've ever seen you read the paper. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 It's one of the few blessings these days. 
 I don't have to squint at a damn screen anymore. 
 You read about how the sprinklers went off at the preview? 
 You can't imagine how many calls I got about that. What a mess. 
 Caused by Roxanna. 
 She created that Japanese carnival. 
 Ash, she's going to ruin the company. 
 Miles. 
 She's drinking again. 
 Oh, god dammit. 
 You need to come back. 
 The board has made their decision, Miles. 
 Besides, I already had one foot out the door. They just gave me a push. 
 Well, now it's my turn to push. 
 I was recently introduced to a man named Simon Peng, who's well-placed in the Jianwun Corporation. 
 They want to buy DeGraaf's. 
 Jianwun? Didn't they just buy a movie studio or something? 
 They're on a spending spree, and they can't wait to overpay. 
 You own 20% of the company. 
 Griffin Young's already on board. He owns 12. 
 I have a three percent stake. I only have to persuade one more board member... and we can save DeGraaf's... your legacy, from ruin. 
 We'd be a Chinese auction house, Miles. 
 Only difference is our access and presence in China. 
 Otherwise, they promise to let us organize it as we see fit. 
 Ah. And this new organization, you would be...? 
 CEO. 
 Oh. 
 And Roxanna would be...? 
 Out. 
 "Junior." 
 Screw this. 
 
 
 
 (RINGS) 
 Yeah. I need a list of every client who was at the Japanese preview the other night. 
 You can't beat the condition. 
 It's the best collection of woodblock prints I've ever seen. 
 You can't beat the condition. 
 Haranobus. Shigemasas. Utamaros. 
 You can't beat the condition. 
 It's the best... it's the best... It's the best collection of woodblock prints I've ever seen. 
 Haranobus, Shigemasas, Utamaros. 
 Absolutely, Mr. Hermann. Of course not, Mrs. Van Lier. 
 (LAUGHS) You have a dinner that night? 
 I'm sure your daughter will understand. 
 Well, I'll call her. 
 Well, I do not want you missing this. 
 Okay. Call me back. 
 I'll be here all day, right at my desk. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Yes. 
 Who was that? 
 Norma Van Lier. She and her husband... 
 Are long-term clients of mine, and they don't appreciate sledgehammer sales pitches. 
 (CHUCKLES) Trust me, my sales pitches work. 
 I'm a people person. 
 Not from where I'm standing. 
 You were supposed to be working with the restoration team. 
 Yeah. I thought it was more important to get the clients back in the fold. 
 That's my job. And... 
 I tell you your job. 
 You see, there's a chain of command here. 
 Let's go. We have to give Roxanna the rundown on the water damage. 
 Mr. Dortch. 
 Sam Brukner would like a word with you. 
 I'm late for an appointment. 
 It might look odd to have a limo following you down the street at five miles per hour. 
 Hey, Luther. 
 Been a long time. How are things? 
 I think you know. The U.S. Attorney's Office wants to talk with me. 
 What would they want to talk to you about, Luther? 
 Our arrangement. The zoning variance. 
 Doesn't ring a bell. 
 Wait. I mean, there is... I do recall a moment where you said you were so eager to help out your constituents. 
 But I barely remember that, because no money ever exchanged hands, right? 
 Well, right. 
 Hmm. So, nothing ever happened. 
 Well, that's not how the U.S. Attorney sees it. 
 (SIGHS) Luther, look at me. 
 It doesn't matter how the U.S. Attorney sees it. 
 You don't even have to talk to him. 
 You can throw him out on his ass. 
 (SIGHS) I can't believe this. I am giving you great advice and you're panicking like you just lost your puppy. 
 Do you really think they're just going to listen to what you have to say and then go, "Oh, you're a pillar of the community, just go on your merry way"? No. 
 They're on a witch hunt. They're out to ruin you, and they're out to ruin me, and the only way that they can do that is if we hand it to them. 
 I'm a God-fearing man, Sam. 
 (SIGHS DEEPLY) That's wonderful. 
 But what does that have to do with anything? 
 My pastor thinks I should cooperate... that that's the righteous thing to do. 
 Right. 
 The righteous thing to do is helping out your fellow man. 
 Reverend Cobb thinks it will be fine. 
 Co... Cobb? 
 And to be frank... 
 War... War... 
 I've built a solid career taking his advice. 
 War... Wardell? Wardell Cobb? 
 "A voice for the community." That's his slogan, right? 
 No. No. No, it's not just a slogan. 
 He's not selling, he's representing. 
 Oh, I'm not going to belabor this. 
 We're both busy men. Thank you for your time. 
 I'll be careful with what I say. 
 Of course you will. 
 (SIGHS) See you around. 
 All right. I want you to get me everything you can find on this publicity-loving preacher named Wardell Cobb. 
 Okay. 
 Unfortunately, they were unable to salvage the wall hanging and a few of the prints. 
 And nothing was covered? 
 We're going to have to eat the sellers' payouts. 
 How bad are the prints? Can we auction them anyway... water stains and all, to mitigate the losses? 
 We can try. Won't go for much. 
 Are we keeping you? 
 Please just tell me the Muramasa sword is okay. 
 Well, the restorers weren't optimistic, considering it was out of its case, but somehow it's unblemished. 
 Graham : It should add to the myth of invincibility. 
 It may raise the value. I'll put the word out. 
 That's not your call to make. 
 Seriously, Roxanna? Have we had enough of this sh1t? 
 I have certainly had enough of yours. 
 I could work for a competitor right now and destroy you. 
 Maybe you should try. 
 Oh, screw it. 
 Oh Christ! Both of you, please. Just... Christ, please. 
 (BUZZING CONTINUES) 
 What? 
 Blake :  Good news, bad news. 
 My editor saw the story I'd put together on DeGraaf's and BidHaus and the great leap forward for Roxanna Whitman out from under her father's shadow. 
 No, that was never what... 
 She's running it today. Out of my hands, so good luck. 
 sh1t! 
 (PHONE CLATTERS) 
 (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 Well, I guess you better come in then. 
 God. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 You know, the last time you came here... 
 I was the drunk one. 
 I'm not drunk. 
 Hey, Roxy. 
 Roxy. 
 It's me. 
 I know. 
 What is it? 
 Everything is going to sh1t. 
 What's going to sh1t? 
 Everything. 
 DeGraaf's. 
 Everything that I have worked so hard for. 
 Ugh. It's all blowing up in my face. 
 So, people are really happy about that one. 
 So, you made a few enemies. 
 Congratulations, now you're the boss. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't feel like one. 
 Well, here. 
 We're going to have a little life lesson. 
 Being the Boss 101. 
 Now pay attention. 
 First. 
 No one gives a sh1t about the way you feel. 
 It's all about how you act. 
 What the hell is this? You sit up. 
 Come on, you're Roxanna Whitman. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that's better. 
 Now... have a puff. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 You know, in business... 
 I think that old adage of the carrot and the stick, it works pretty well in just about every situation. 
 I mean, personally, I'm more of a stick kind of a guy, but... 
 That doesn't surprise me. 
 Yeah, but you know the carrot works just as well. 
 You just have to know when to use one or the other. Right? 
 Mm. 
 Like for instance, right now I am in a carrot situation, and I'm not going to bore you with all the particulars, but I can tell you this... they're going to get one big bite at it, and then I'm going to bring out the big stick. Jimmy Hoffa style. 
 You really quoting Jimmy Hoffa right now? 
 No. No, no, look, what I'm trying to say is that... people know where I stand. 
 And the moment I don't trust someone, they are gone. 
 I'm sorry, Sam. 
 No, you don't have anything to feel sorry about. 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 (CELL PHONE BEEPS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Graham. Arthur. 
 Let's sell. 
 Ryan : I'm telling you, she had eyes like... 
 Like I don't want to have s*x with her, I want to have kids with her. Those kind of eyes, you know? 
 I do. 
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about girls. 
 Nah, shut up. It's cool. I'm happy for you. 
 Then, um, FYI. 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 I ran into Katie Boyle. She was asking about you. 
 Anyway, I'm sure you've got better sh1t to do than to get me coffee. 
 I'm putting off giving a friend some bad news and going to my shitty job. 
 Wait, the one you got your ass kicked to get all of a week ago? 
 Yeah, it's bullshit. They treat me like I'm some rookie off the street. 
 I feel like I'm talking to Dad. 
 What does that mean? 
 You've always had a hard-on for winning. 
 God forbid anybody can be above you for more than a millisecond. 
 Yeah, and he quit. He settled for a job where he was disrespected every day of his life. 
 Suck it up, Tommy. 
 The voice of wisdom. 
 Didn't Cliff talk to you already about the timeline? 
 He did, but BidHaus is built on your designs. 
 You're the reason we bought the company, not Cliff. 
 You know what can and can't be done. 
 It's just... you know, it's not much time. 
 I'm not hearing you say it can't be done. 
 Look, Tyler. You tell me what you need and we'll make it happen. 
 I mean... we might be able to do a slightly pared down... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Platform. 
 What's going on? Didn't realize we had a meeting on the books. 
 We didn't. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Well, you want to bring me up to speed? 
 The short version? 
 I gave you an opportunity to deliver. 
 You didn't come through. You're fired. 
 Now... do you want to be Wozniak or do you want to be Jobs? 
 You know I don't like meeting so publicly. 
 You ever heard the phrase "in plain sight"? 
 Besides, I figured you'd be happy to get out of that warehouse, let me buy you lunch. 
 (WHISPERS) Marwan is good for tomorrow night after his shop closes. 
 Did the FBI agree to the extra money? 
 I don't think we ever had pizza in Mosul. 
 No, we didn't. And you didn't get the money. 
 They want me to wear a wire to the meet. 
 Okay. If I'd asked for a hundred, and the FBI heard I only gave them 50, we'd both be screwed, Hassan. 
 You could have figured it out. 
 I'll figure it out. 
 I'll figure it out. You just... you've got to give me some more time. 
 Would you be asking for more time if that cop had your family? 
 You're the only one who's suffered? 
 Is that what you're saying to me? 
 Is that what you're saying to me? Huh? 
 My girlfriend is dead! 
 You will have another girlfriend. 
 Don't you... don't you dare! 
 You think because she's not family that it's not as bad? 
 Look, at least we get to eat the pizza voted best in New York. 
 Every place claims that. 
 Empty promises. In this country? 
 (SPITS) It's not that good. 
 (EXHALES DEEPLY) 
 Arthur :  I don't understand  why the IRS is still threatening to seize the apartment. 
 I just paid them $500,000 dollars, Barry. 
 Well, when's the next payment due? 
 (BEEPS) 
 (LOCK BUZZING) 
 I... I can't get it that fast. 
 Please see what you can work out with them. 
 I'm going to have to call you back. 
 Something tells me you, uh, you need my help. 
 I wouldn't be here otherwise. 
 Stellar. 
 Assyrian. 1300 B.C.? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 Yes, it's... it's very nice. 
 I knew you could appreciate their value. 
 I can sell them to you for $150,000 dollars. 
 (CLICKS TONGUE) That's quite a bargain. 
 They're worth well over 350. That alone is worth 250. 
 Yes, I'd love to take them off your hands, but unfortunately I'm... (LAUGHS) 
 I'm, financially, a bit strapped right now. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Yes, I know it's hard to believe, but nothing is liquid. 
 The IRS has fleeced me of everything. Bastards. 
 Okay, well... 
 80,000. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Okay, 50. 50, huh? Please. 
 Look, Hassan... as I already made clear to our mutual friend, Graham, I'm no longer in the market for smuggled antiquities. 
 You don't have to keep them. 
 A man like you, you could sell them, make a quick profit. 
 A few months ago, I had the FBI here questioning me. 
 I can't afford to take that risk again. 
 (SCREAMS IN ARABIC) 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Sorry. 
 Okay. This was supposed to be our path for a new life here in America. 
 Where my... my wife could go where she pleased... my son could go to school unafraid. 
 Our one chance at being free. 
 I'm sorry, Hassan. 
 (BAG ZIPS) 
 Really, I am. 
 Graham mentioned you used to be an engineer before all this. 
 I was. 
 I'm too far from that now. 
 Maybe we shouldn't get hung up on exactly what we do. 
 We do what we have to to survive. Right? 
 What are these worth if no one will buy them? 
 Well, their value is only determined by what the market will pay. 
 It works both ways. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (PEOPLE CHATTERING) 
 There she is. 
 What can I do for you, Miles? 
 I know you have a lot on your plate, what with the sprinklers and all. 
 Just wanted to remind you Sophie's birthday party is next week. 
 (SIGHS) Are you serious? 
 Sadly, yes. And I promised my daughter to make sure her favorite auntie... got the invitation. So... there you go. 
 You're a wonderful father. 
 Yes. Yes, I think I am. 
 Well, I'm thrilled to know there is one person in the world you won't lie to. 
 And if I ever hear you filled her head with any of your lies... 
 Relax. I love her too much to tell her the truth. 
 I'll let Sophie know... that you send your regrets. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 There is one more thing I'd like to discuss with you before you go. 
 Until it's clear your presence will not adversely affect DeGraaf's, I'm going to have to put you on mandatory leave, what with the FBI investigation and all. 
 You can't. 
 Oh, I can. Check your bylaws. 
 And, Sheila! 
 I'm going to need that coffee. 
 And when you're done with that, please pack up your desk. 
 I've arranged for you to be reassigned. 
 Do you suppose they kill themselves out of pride or disgrace? 
 Two sides of the same coin. 
 (SCOFFS) I don't know. 
 I don't think I could do it. 
 So messy. Blood and guts all over the floor. 
 Be the Muramasa's rightful owner and you're invincible. Problem solved. 
 What's this? 
 An offer... from one buyer for your whole lot. Just over a million. 
 Problem not entirely solved, but thank you. 
 You made the right decision. 
 You should stick around for the auction later. 
 It's going to be fun. 
 Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to show my face, just in case anyone has any ill-conceived notions about my estate sale. 
 Roxanna : Graham. 
 Uh, boss is calling. 
 In the last 18 hours I have fired someone, promoted someone, reassigned someone, and put someone on leave. 
 Did you quit or do I have to figure out what to do with you as well? 
 I needed a day off. 
 I got Davenport an offer over estimate. 
 Hm. 
 And you think that gets you off my sh1t list? 
 (CHUCKLES) What does? 
 Do your job, which is whatever Alesha and I tell you to do. 
 Can you handle that or not? Last chance. 
 I can handle that... for now. 
 How's the auction going? 
 Four items irreparably damaged, we'll do about 70% of initial projections, and out of respect, I now have to bow to the Japanese Arts Minister. 
 You got to bow to him? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Screw him. 
 Humility, Graham. You might want to try it. 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 Yeah? 
 Transmitter's in the second button. 
 He can pat you down all he wants, he's not going to find it. 
 Anything doesn't look right, not going according to plan, leave. 
 You think you can't leave, ask to use the restroom. That'll be our signal. 
 Where will you be? 
 Around the corner. 
 A safe distance, but close enough. 
 Any other words of wisdom? 
 Don't f*ck it up. 
 (SIGHS) All right. 
 It's all there. 
 Introduce me. Make the call. 
 Just you or your partners, too? 
 Partners? No, no, it's just going to be me. 
 What about Hassan and the other guy, Uzay? 
 Uzay? 
 You talked with Uzay? 
 What the hell is he doing? 
 Marwan :  My cousin was talking about a deal with him, too. 
 Aren't you all the same group? 
 No. No, no we're not. 
 Where is he? 
 That's between my cousin and him. 
 Yeah. And you, clearly. 
 What are you doing? 
 What is he doing? 
 Graham :  I just gave you $50,000,  you can answer my questions. 
 The money is not mine. 
 You can answer my questions! 
 Okay. 
 Just tell me where Uzay is. 
 You Americans. 
 We should have moved to Canada. Get out of my store. 
 Tell me where Uzay is. 
 No! 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GUN COCKS) 
 Marwan :  I'm not introducing you to anyone! 
 sh1t. 
 (GUNSHOT)
