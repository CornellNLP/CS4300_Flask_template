 Previously on "The Art of More"... 
 Your ownership stake will be valued at up to $48 a share. 
 You're overpaying. The company's screwed. The board knows it. 
 I'm selling to protect you from that. 
 They're gonna sell, so we need them to sell to us. 
 Are you sure you wanna go to the wall with this? 
 Start making the calls. 
 Girard : Nine million. 
 Davenport :  I found a wonderful piece. 
 12 million euro. Joseph is my only path to solvency. 
 Get a job. 
 I believe I can help you with your museum. 
 I want a job. 
 What? With me? 
 Yes, and I warn you, I don't come cheap. 
 (whispers) You were always a willing participant. 
 A 15-year-old is never willing. 
 "Not fair" is getting raped by your future brother-in-law and then having your mother not believe you. 
 I believe you. 
 The name of your buyer. 
 Graham :  Paul Rice wants to meet my buyer,  so I need a big name. 
 Me. 
 This is my pond you chose to dip your toe in. 
 You have yourself a good evening with that charming daughter of yours. 
 (tires screech) 
 Ah! You almost hit those kids. 
 (gunshot) 
 (gags) 
 Hassan, where are you? 
 Where are you? 
 (car approaching) 
 (birds chirping) 
 ♪ It's so easy now, it's so easy now ♪ 
♪ It's so easy now, it's so easy now ♪ 
♪ I looked around, and I found ♪ 
♪ What I'm looking for ♪ 
♪ Then it took some time ♪ 
 (on radio) ♪ But I finally found what I'm looking for ♪ 
♪ Each time I look into your eyes ♪ 
 (music continues) 
 ♪ And every feeling that I... ♪ 
 (engine stops) 
 (music stops) 
 Thank you. I'm stuck here for over an hour. 
 Oh, no problem, man. 
 Hey, are you with the circus or something? 
 No, I-I... I do kids parties. 
 Oh. 
 I was one my way to one when my back tire blew out. 
 I can't budge the lug nuts. You look like you're in better shape than me. 
 Yeah, sure, I'll give it a try, man. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Say, it's kinda early in the morning for a kids party, isn't it? 
 (chuckles) I like to set up early, you know? 
 Morning of a performance, I... I get so excited to... to get into the makeup and... become the other person. 
 (ominous music playing) 
 (grunts) 
 (thuds) 
 (inhales deeply) 
 (clicks) 
 (music continues) 
 Alesha : Wow. This is so cool. 
 The video displays, not the murders. 
 It's enhancing the creepiness. 
 (sighs) If that's what we're going for, then... 
 We're extending the conversation to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. 
 I don't want to endorse these guys. 
 Nobody had a problem when we sold Stalin's uniform or Custer's sword. 
 At least Kaczynski was on a smaller scale. 
 (Martin scoffs) Yeah. 
 (beeps) 
 Do you think you could ever kill anyone? 
 Um... well, I really hope not. 
 Bet there was a time when these guys didn't think they could either. 
 Well, they figured it out. 
 (people shouting outside) 
 Jianwun is moving fast because they see the value in DeGraaf's. 
 That's why we have to move even faster. 
 Yes, 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Sudha. Thank you. 
 My brother was killed, and you're selling souvenirs! 
 Why? Why are you doing that? 
 Roxanna Whitman for James Thompson, please. 
 What the hell is going on out there? 
 Well, a victims' rights group got wind of the auction and showed up about an hour ago. It had been pretty quiet. 
 Well, now it's blowing up. 
 Should I call the police? 
 No, we don't want footage of victims' families being dragged from the building going viral. 
 Right, but we don't want protesters scaring away clients either. 
 We chose Murderabilia for our first BidHaus auction because it's controversial. Mmm. 
 Let's see where this publicity takes us. Keep an eye on it for me. 
 Keep an eye on it. 
 (shouting continues) 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 Graham! Graham! 
 Graham. 
 Wake up! 
 (gasping) 
 What you do? That's it. 
 You dumbass, what you do? 
 (shower continues running) 
 (coughing) 
 (theme music playing) 
 Thank you. Thank you for coming out on such short notice, doctor. 
 I would like to keep this... (whispers) extra-special quiet, okay, so... 
 My office will bill you, Sam. 
 I'm a doctor. It's all extra-special quiet. 
 Have him take it easy, a lot of fluids over the next 24 hours. 
 But if he really wants to get a handle on this, I'd do 20 milligrams of Elavil once per day, and he should really see a counselor. 
 There are several that I could recommend who specialize in PTSD. 
 PTSD? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (sighs) 
 Rest. Fluids. 
 You got it. I don't need that sh1t. 
 (door opens) 
 Graham : Throw it in the trash on your way out. 
 Why don't you put yourself in there while you're at it? 
 What the hell do you think you were doing? 
 None of your business. 
 Oh, I think it is, after I saved your ass twice. 
 I've been trying to get ahold of you since last night, all this morning. Finally, I have to track you down. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I spoke to Paul Rice. 
 Hi. 
 (people shouting outside) 
 Alesha : What the hell? 
 (Martin chuckles) 
 So, yeah, umm... one of the protesters threw fake blood on me. 
 (laughs) 
 Okay, one thing at a time. Go ahead. 
 So, we'll have this page constantly refreshing, so we can see the bids in real time. 
 Okay. 
 And then, clicking through to the next page, we get... 
 (static) 
 Tyler? 
 I don't know. It was working a minute ago. 
 Hey. 
 (sighs) 
 Tyler : No, I don't understand. 
 This page is live? 
 So, the controversy caused more traffic than we built for. 
 The site crashed. 
 The auction is in two days. 
 W... we'll fix it. 
 And in the meantime? 
 He said hello to my daughter. 
 He talked to Olivia. 
 (mutters) He's such a piece of sh1t. 
 I was so close to just leaving you with your dick in your hands to handle Rice by yourself. 
 Well, thank you. 
 f*ck you. f*ck you. 
 Don't you say "thank you" to me! 
 You put my little girl in jeopardy! 
 Nothing's gonna happen. 
 You little sh1t! Do you realize that? 
 Do you realize that? 
 Yes. I understand. 
 I'm sorry, okay? I'm gonna deal with it. 
 How you gonna do that? You don't even have your own sh1t together. 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 Sam : Says the guy that I found in the bathtub. 
 (sniffles) 
 (Sam sighs) 
 A guy that I was in Iraq with... he died. 
 And I found out last night. 
 That's tough. 
 I don't know about that stuff. I was... I... 
 I was in the army. I didn't see any action. Grenada was going on. 
 We stayed in North Carolina. 
 Lucky you. 
 Yeah, well... you think I don't know that? 
 (sighs) 
 Look, I am sorry about your friend, but... 
 (sighs) I care a hell of a lot more about Olivia. 
 You and Olivia are out of this from now on, okay? 
 Listen to me. I promise. 
 You just take care of Rice. 
 You take care of that. 
 (sighs) Or next time, I swear to God, I'm not even gonna bother. I'm just gonna leave you in that bathtub. 
 Let you drown in your own puke. 
 (sighs) 
 Ramirez :  I told you guys. I said he'd come through. 
 You never said that. 
 No. I didn't, but I also didn't haul your ass into jail. 
 Okay. You're gonna call Rice, set up the buy. 
 Let him pick the time, the location, whatever he wants, just do it. Make him feel like he's all warm and cozy in bed with you. 
 Mind if we just have a moment alone... just chicken and chicken master? 
 Yeah. 
 I'd offer you a chair, but I had them removed. 
 People sit down, they get a little too chatty. 
 I'm not feeling too chatty. 
 I heard. 
 Well, you didn't tell me about it. 
 You got a lot on your plate. Guy was a fugitive. 
 He was bound to get caught sooner or later. 
 He didn't just get caught. 
 Washington was using him. 
 What? And how would you know that unless you were in contact with Hassan? 
 Washington was blackmailing Hassan, making him pay him off. 
 Hassan couldn't pay, so Washington put a bullet in his head. 
 All right. God damn. What do you want me to do about it? 
 Arrest a decorated cop on the word of some low-rent smuggler and murderer? 
 He was an engineer! He had a family! 
 (sighs) 
 I'm gonna let you have that one. 
 You gotta arrest Washington. 
 (emphatically) Rice. Rice. Rice. 
 That is the only name you need to be thinking about right now. 
 Set up the deal. 
 I'll leave that with you. 
 Put a car on him. 
 Nicole : Mr. Davenport? 
 Yes. 
 Hi. I'm Sam's assistant, Nicole. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. He'll only be a moment, so if you'd like to wait. 
 Oh. Thank you. I'll wait right in here. 
 (whistling) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Excuse me. 
 Davenport : Certainly. 
 Sam : Nicole. 
 Nicole? 
 Nicole : Yes? 
 Will you call Olivia, tell her I want to have lunch? 
 Nicole : Okay. 
 Also, where the hell is the proposal for the Bloomfield Estates? 
 Nicole : Legal had to make some changes to that, and Mr. Davenport's here to see you. 
 Oh. I completely forgot about our appointment. 
 That's quite all right, Sam. 
 Nicole, could you leave us for a minute? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Ooh. 
 Only a minute? 
 Yeah, well, I thought about your job idea, and I'm gonna pass. 
 But hey, you still got 55 seconds. 
 I'm sure you recognize most of the names in here. 
 Ooh! It's a who's who of pompous assholes. 
 (chuckles) All the better when these assholes come groveling to you. 
 Think of it, Sam. It's what you've always wanted... the New York art elite kissing your ass. 
 Ad nausea. 
 (chuckling) 
 Look, just lay off the dime-store analysis, all right? 
 I buy art because I love it. 
 It's a great investment, and so is this museum. 
 All right, let's talk dollars and cents. 
 If I don't deliver, then you owe me nothing. 
 If I do, then I want 5% of all moneys I raise for the museum, and I also want an official title... director. 
 My name on the board will help inspire others. 
 Well, I do have to say that I am starting to fall in love with the idea of you being my employee. 
 Yes, think of me as... 
 I don't know, an independent contractor. 
 Nah. I think I'll just think of you as my little bitch. 
 Let's not get into name-calling, shall we? 
 All right. Okay, look, you bring me 10 names that are on this list, and I will consider your little title, but... you only get to take 2% of the money. 
 Now, come on, Sam, that's hardly... 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 You don't want people thinking that you were only doing it for the cash, like you need it. 
 (chuckles) 
 Sales are already up 10% above projections. 
 By year end alone, shareholder equity will be valued at $48 a share. 
 Jianwun is offering $40 a share. 
 We propose Thompson Equity to come in at 45 to block the takeover then reap the profits. 
 In exchange for us bringing this to you, the current board will stay in place and I'll be named permanent CEO. 
 Your projections lean pretty heavily on BidHaus's success, and yet, even when I go to your regular old web site... it's down. 
 For testing purposes only. 
 BidHaus will be ready to launch tomorrow as planned. 
 Mr. Sudha. 
 You are where you are because you see things others don't. 
 Do they see a web site? 
 It all comes down to this... 
 Uncertainty. 
 That's what it comes down to. 
 We'll... discuss it, internally. 
 Of course. Thank you. 
 Howard : Thanks for coming by. 
 Howard. 
 Roxanna : Thanks so much. 
 Howard : Good to see you. 
 (door opens) 
 (Roxanna sighs) 
 Well... we pitched through the order. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Got a plan "B"? 
 Howard, we won't need one. 
 (clacks) 
 (sighs) 
 (glass thuds) 
 (Latin music playing) 
 Hey. I'm sorry. 
 Oh, wow, Mom. Bad idea. 
 Unless it was yours. Seems your style. 
 I had no idea. 
 I think we all need to clear the air. 
 Sit. 
 There's no cilantro. I know that you hate cilantro. 
 I'm fine. Thank you. 
 This has gone on way too long between the two of you, and I should've done something sooner. 
 What were you supposed to do? She is who she is. 
 That's not the tone we're looking for, Clarissa. 
 What tone are we looking for? And you, after you getting my husband arrested? 
 I'm not looking for anything. 
 Evelyn : Yes, you are. 
 Roxanna, say what you need to say. 
 Clarissa : Don't tell me she's talking you into her lies too, Mom. 
 I'm surprised... 
 Evelyn : She's not lying. She's telling the truth, and you need to listen. 
 The night before your wedding... 
 Roxanna came to me very late. 
 She was crying. She'd been out by the pool, alone, she thought. 
 And then Miles came out. 
 Clarissa : She is pathological. 
 Mom, let's not... 
 He raped her. 
 Clarissa, he raped her. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 I wish I was. 
 You f*cking bitch. 
 Evelyn : Clarissa. 
 (door closes) 
 Davenport : Well, this is it. 
 Joshua : Mmm. 
 Of course, you have to use your imagination. 
 The idea is to take something raw and make it beautiful. 
 So, this is the main entrance hall, and this ramp leads to the first gallery. 
 Very exciting. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 (chuckles) 
 Uh, you are... what was the title? 
 Oh, director, on the board. 
 Yes, Brukner started work on this, but he soon realized he needed someone to bring it all together. 
 By the time we're done... this place will house the greatest collection of outsider art in the world. 
 You may put me down for a donation. 
 Well, that's very generous of you, Joseph, but I can assure you that was not my intention. 
 Not that big of a donation. 
 (chuckles) Maybe bronze level? 
 Ah... 
 (both laugh) 
 This is where you will have your fundraiser? 
 Well, normally, we rent out ballrooms for that kind of thing, unless people want dirt in their champagne. 
 You worry about appearances too much. 
 Serve them dirt in their champagne. 
 Tell them it's art. 
 (laughs) 
 Well, I gotta get going. 
 Yes. Yes, of course. 
 So, we'll talk tomorrow and in the meantime, enjoy your Ruscha. 
 I will, once it's fully appraised. 
 Appraised? 
 Yes, one of my friend told me I should do that. 
 Yes, yes, of course. Silly me. I should've suggested it myself. 
 We'll talk in the morning. 
 Yes. 
 Take care. 
 
 
 
 What am I looking at here, Tommy? 
 Her name's Suzy Radcliffe. 
 That's their son. 
 (sighs) Your father's standing next to a woman with a kid. 
 It doesn't mean anything. 
 Come on, Ma. 
 No, you come on. Stop pulling my leg. 
 Where'd you find that anyway? 
 It's part of a famous collection of photographs. 
 This could end up in a museum or in a gallery. Is that what you want? 
 (cup, kettle clatter) 
 Okay, so you were here, changing my diapers, and he was off, running around with her... and their son. 
 His name is Matthew. 
 I have been calling you all damn day. 
 Get out of the bathtub and give me an update. 
 (door opens) 
 People. Some of them are so hard to find. 
 (sighs) 
 How was your trip? 
 It was a funeral, Sam, not a vacation. 
 These are the new acquisitions I wanted to show you... as well as the upper-level staff I'd like to hire. 
 Mmm. Really? 
 'Cause me, when I'm grieving, I like to fire people. 
 (chuckles) 
 Different strokes. 
 Yin and yang, makes for a good team. 
 Mmm. 
 What do you got? 
 This is Magnus Eggertsson. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 As we've discussed, I think it would subvert expectations. 
 It would grab people when they first enter. 
 And this is Thierry Gasan. 
 I think it would be a great compliment to the other piece. 
 What's going on with you? 
 What do you mean? 
 You're a married woman. I'm your boss. 
 What do you want? 
 Are you gonna reduce us to those labels? 
 I like to boil things down to the basics. 
 We don't have to talk about this at all. 
 All right. Back to work. 
 (sighs deeply) 
 There was no funeral. 
 What? 
 There was no funeral. I wanted to take a breath and get some distance from you. 
 Did it help? 
 No. 
 So you just let him back in the house? 
 Back in our lives after what he did? 
 Huh? 
 My business, Tommy, not yours. 
 Of course it's my business. He was my dad. 
 I looked up to him. The whole time, he had another family? 
 What were we, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays? 
 You don't disrespect me, Tommy! 
 I'm not disrespecting you. 
 I'm disrespecting him. I never said he was a hero. 
 You knew that. You knew he had his flaws. 
 You picked the side of him you wanted to believe in, and that's fine. 
 That's good, Tommy. I picked around what I needed to make our lives work. 
 Yeah, well, you should've left him. 
 I was trying to find a way to forgive. 
 (sighs) 
 (people shouting outside) 
 (door closes) 
 (sighs) 
 Oh. Hey, I left you two messages. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I was tied up. What's going on? 
 Well, I had to have security remove some of the belligerent protesters, which the blogs noticed, but it's only added to online traffic. 
 Oh, for a web site that doesn't work. How very helpful. 
 No, registration is back online through the DeGraaf's homepage, thankfully, but BidHaus... (clears throat) is... is still down. 
 Well, we're debugging, repairing, stress-testing, but it's gonna take time. 
 I mean, even if we work straight through, I'm not sure we'll make the 8:00 a.m. launch. 
 Well, if we don't make the launch, then there is no launch. 
 More like an explosion on the launching pad. 
 Hi. Jeff and his crew are here for your interview, about the Biggs photos and auction. 
 Yeah, okay, fine. 
 Uh, Roxanna. 
 Why don't you take a few minutes? Get some coffee, some water, do the interview later? 
 We do it now. 
 Jeff : Okay, just pretend none of this is here, It's just you and me, we're having a little one-on-one, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay, let's... talk a little bit about the background of DeGraaf's... so I have it, and then we can talk about the Biggs photos. 
 Okay. 
 DeGraaf's was founded in 1883. 
 It is the largest privately-owned auction house with a long-standing tradition of history and excellence. 
 But also with one step forward, one step ahead. 
 Have you met my father? We're very different people, but he is the... he is the tradition... traditionalist, and I am the... I am the step forward. 
 This is a new era. We need new changes. 
 Is there any water? People are responding, though. 
 Numbers don't lie. 
 People do. 
 But numbers don't. 
 Okay. I think we're going a little bit off course. 
 Your pictures... Jeff. 
 They have a lot of power. 
 You can see it in their eyes. 
 They're honest. 
 And that gives them power. 
 Sure. Uh... why don't you talk a little bit about the art, then? 
 People don't like me here. 
 Why? 
 Because I have... ambition. 
 Because I stand up for myself. 
 Roxanna, are... are you okay? 
 (sighs deeply) 
 I hate these goddamn chairs... and I... I hate this room... (crying) and I hate this building. 
 And no offense, Jeff, but I hate this interview. 
 Bill me.

 (phone buzzes) 
 Yeah. Ryan? 
 Ryan on phone :  I just heard the news... about Hassan. 
 You okay? Yeah, what are you gonna do? It is what it is. Ryan :  All right. Let me know if there's anything you need. Yeah. Actually... there is. Can I borrow your car? Joseph : How long does an appraisal usually take? Davenport : Huh! Longer than it should. I have a theory about these fellows. I think they think we don't appreciate how overworked and underpaid they are. So they take extra long just to make themselves seem more important. Keep my glass full, and I could wait all day. Or if you have to get back to work, I can always call you when he's done. It's all right. When your father built the company, you set your own hours. Must be an interesting man, your father, to have come from nothing and become so powerful. Interesting, maybe. Tough, definitely. You don't want to make him mad. (both laugh) Really? How so? I'll only say that at an early age I learned how to handle a gun. Uh-huh. Hunting? Joseph : I remember when I was a teenager, a rival wanted to buy my father's company... but he refused to sell. The man came to our house and threatened him... and us. We are building a swimming pool at the moment, so there was all this cement laying around. My father marches this man outside, and... Man : Sorry about the delay, gentlemen. Had to check with our people in London. The market for Ruscha is pretty volatile. It is? Mmm. So, based on recent auction figures, I concur with the bill of sale, 12 million. We'll forward this onto your underwriter. Great. Thank you. Excellent. (Joseph and Davenport chuckle) (clears throat) (sloshes, rattles) Hey, what's the quickest way to the meat-packing district from here? Sam : What's at the meat-packing district? I have dinner plans. With who? Just some guy I met at the gallery opening. What guy? His name is Kishir. He's from Mumbai. He was gonna give me tours of all... At the gallery. He wasn't, like, with this older bald guy, was he? Why are you freaking out? I'm not freaking out. I'm just asking you a question. Right. Which you still haven't answered. Because I'm not 16. But hey, when a guy asks me to prom, I'll let you know. Olivia. I'm allowed to be concerned. It... I have no idea what you do. And I don't know why that's suddenly a problem after 26 years. (door opens) Made... quite a meal out of that, didn't you? I guess it needed to look convincing. You asked for 12 million, I gave you 12 million. Thank you. This never happened. Understood? Of course. Good day. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yes, Mom. I'm doing my yoga. Yes, all of my exercises. (sighs) He's fine. I'll tell him when I wanna tell him, okay? (car approaches) No, not yet. Jesus, Mom.

Hey. All right, all right. Graham  (whispers) Come down here. Take it easy, take it easy. All right? What do you need? Face the wall. Whoever you are... Badge. ...you owe me five bucks for that pie. That was the last slice of cherry, god damn it. (gun rattles) (sighs) Guy, you're making a big mistake here. No mistake here, Detective Washington. Where's Hassan's family? Hey, I don't know what you're talking about. Where are they? You know, this is like deja vu all over again. Man, I just had the same conversation recently with another guy. Didn't end too well for him. You told Hassan they were in an ICE detention center, but we both know that's bullshit. So you'd better give me an address. Graham Connor, is that you? Hassan didn't have too many American friends. Thought I recognized the voice. Can we turn around here, huh? This is a little ridiculous, ain't it? (mutters) Jesus. You tell me where they are or I will shoot you where you stand. I swear to God. You really should've thought this through, you know that? Let me think about it. Even if I did know where they were, you kill me... you'll never find out. (screams) You get your gun and badge back when I get what I want! Argh! (shouts) (both moan) I have to. No. You know, you have a pretty good body. Mmm. That's because I'm exceptionally vain. Mmm. (chuckles) I've noticed. Well, you're not that bad yourself, you know? Oof. Not that bad? Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm. (chuckles) Oh sh1t. I had to leave 20 minutes ago. What? Just tell him you had a flat tire. He's not stupid. (growls) Ooh! What is he then? (sighs) Really? How long have you been married? Seriously? Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna have to talk sometime, and I'm really curious about you, so... (exhales sharply) What? We have been married 17 years. Yeah. He's a good guy, but he's busy and I'm busy. And we have a 16-year-old son... Mm-hmm. ...and he's brilliant... but he's having a rough adolescence. And I also have a German shepherd named Guinness. Mmm. And a mother-in-law who's a neat freak. Don't say anything about that. I really would've settled for your favorite ice cream. (laughs) You kinda got me going again. (moaning) Again? After that? (moans, laughs) I have to go. (shower running) (door creaks open) Hey, Graham. Why don't you step on out, huh? And we can have a little chat about Hassan and his family. Tell me what you know and... I won't blow your head off. (chuckles) (gun cocks) FBI. Put your weapon on the ground. Now. Now! All right, all right. All right, up. Up. On... on the ground! Good. (handcuffs rattle) (clicking) You really should've thought this through more. See you later. I'm not always gonna come running when you call. Not always gonna call. (door closes) He's never gonna admit to kidnapping them. You might wanna give up trying to find that family. Thanks.
