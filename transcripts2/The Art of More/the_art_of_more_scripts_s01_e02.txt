 Previously on "The Art of More". 
 Sold! 
 I just want the chance to do something that I love. 
 Is that the secret to your success? 
 That you're a cocky sh1t who bulldozed his way into the business? 
 You mean is that how I stole Davenport away from you? 
 Graham Connor. 
 Sam Brukner. 
 Just make sure that when your name is up in lights, my name is there, too. 
 Mr. Connor. It's been too long. 
 You have a new life because of the work we did together. 
 What do you want? 
 Helping Hassan move Stolen merchandise. 
 (gun shots) 
 What did you do? 
 I got it all under control. 
 (gun shot) 
 (crowd cheering) 
 Hey, this is from Pete. 
 Does he need it back? 
 He... he something on the other side. 
 Ladies and gentlemen! 
 The Who! 
 (crowd cheering)

 Pick up the bass, Jack, come on. 
 You're the new keyboardist, right? 
 Uh... yep. Yeah. 
 Rodger said to make you feel at home. 
 Have you ever been with two girls? 
 Lyrics for "Won't Get Fooled Again" hand-written by Pete Townsend. 
 And you see this "K" on the back? 
 That stands for Kenny. That's me. 
 I filled in for Robert Bedrick. 
 He played keyboards and... 
 All right. Yeah, I know who he is. 
 Yeah. 
 So how do I know this is even real? 
 I mean, you could have just scribbled this down five minutes ago. 
 Check the paper from the day after. 
 Or compare the handwriting to anything else Pete's ever written. 
 Ken, Ken. 
 You seem like a nice kid but I'm a businessman. I'm not a detective. 
 I'll give you $200 for it. 
 Take it, or leave it. 
 You're lucky I need the money. 
 The reserve is 500,000. 
 You think I can get it for that? 
 Rock and roll memorabilia attracts a very passionate group of bidders. 
 So it'll likely go higher. 
 Graham Connor is handling the account. 
 He might have a better take on who your competition might be. 
 Graham. 
 How you doing? Hey. 
 Graham, Michael Bookman. 
 He's one of my most valued clients. 
 Edward tells me you put all this together. 
 Hell of a show. 
 Thank you. 
 Michael usually concentrates on post-war contemporary art. 
 But he tells me his son is very interested in the "Won't Get Fooled Again" lyrics. 
 Oh, big Who fan. 
 As far as a 10-year-old can be. 
 I'm sure it'll be Kanye West or someone else by next week. 
 10 years old? 
 If you'll excuse me, another client wants to play the Hendrix guitar with his teeth. 
 Will you excuse me for a moment, Michael? 
 You and I need to talk about the other night. 
 Why'd you disappear in mid-auction? 
 Well, I had no choice. 
 A potential client had a last minute layover at JFK. 
 But I did personally congratulate Mr. Hui. 
 Who is this potential client? 
 A Mr. Silva from Brazil. 
 That's all I got. I apologize. 
 I should have let someone know. 
 Don't let this happen again. 
 It won't. 
 See anything you like? 
 Very funny. 
 So has Hassan finally gone? 
 From our lives? Yeah. 
 And what does that mean? 
 He still needs to sell the other items. 
 But I'm not going to be involved. 
 And you're not going to be involved. 
 Graham, don't be naive. 
 As long as that man inhabits the same galaxy as we do, any contact with him poses a problem. 
 A very sizable one. 
 I don't want to have this discussion with you again. 
 You got it? 
 Look at that. 
 It's perfectly preserved. 
 Oh-oh, what you doing back there? 
 (gun shots) 
 He's a security guard for Christ sake! He's not a cop! 
 He was going to arrest us. 
 He's still alive. 
 He needs a doctor! 
 He saw our faces! 
 You know what he needs. 
 What are you doing? 
 Stay back! 
 (speaking in foreign language) 
 (whistles) 
 What's the matter with you? 
 Keep you mouth shut. 
 What? She's in great shape. 
 Come on. Ground rules time. 
 Listen, first rule... We have no contact until we get some burner phones. 
 Rule two... Once the Gudea's gone, I'm not storing the other stuff. 
 You're on your own. 
 Where are you going to store it? 
 I'm going to keep it with me in the hotel room. 
 I'm going to put on the "do not disturb" sign and watch pay-per-view all week (laughs) 
 I'm going to rent a temporary storage facility. 
 An Iraqi national in town on a vacation visa rents a temporary storage unit? 
 What's the matter with you? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 I got to be the master-mind of something I want no part of. 
 Give me a few hours to figure this out. 
 Do me a favor. Find out where the hell a supervisor is. 
 F.B.I., Special Agent Kramer. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Gwen. 
 Graham. 
 Day shift guy found him this morning. 
 A robbery gone side ways? 
 Looks like it, yeah. 
 I doubt they were after these dresses. 
 You can find them for about 15 bucks on Canal Street. 
 Oh, we may get a break. 
 A security camera on the other side of the lot. 
 We'll see what they might have. 
 And we found this by the open box. 
 Yeah, molding plastic, to protect or disguise whatever they were really after. 
 Artwork, antiquities. 
 Where'd the shipment originate? 
 Turkey. 
 Mersin. 
 I'll coordinate with Interpol. 
 See if they have anything. 
 Yeah. That'll work. 
 The boss' granddaughter doesn't get a better parking spot than this? 
 I'm not looking for special treatment. 
 I hate to break it to you, but your grandfather owns the place. 
 There's no way you'll be treated like a normal entry level employee. 
 Not at first but once they realize I'm not a pretentious brat maybe they'll dislike me for legitimate reasons. 
 They'll like you. 
 It's part of my job to know quality when I see it. 
 Thank you. 
 Anyway, I go to convince you that I regret my disappearing act the other night. 
 I hope whoever you abandoned me for made it worth your while. 
 He did. And I apologize again. 
 I actually had a great time after you left. 
 I met a cute guy from the new museum in the Bowery Have you been? 
 I haven't. 
 Yeah. You should go. 
 Everyone at Parke-Mason should. 
 Sounds like a great little field trip. 
 Let me know how Prescott responds. 
 I'm just saying that there's more to art appreciation than a heavy price tag. 
 We need to find and promote the current day Picassos if we want to remain relevant. 
 Can I take you to dinner sometime to make up for the whole abandonment thing? 
 Oh, so you can abruptly disappear before my salad arrives? 
 I'll be glued to my seat. I promise. 
 You can even order a main course. 
 How about it? 
 It's probably not a good idea now that I work here. 
 Aw! 
 Are you coming in? 
 No. 
 No, I'm boycotting the place until you say yes. 
 I have a meeting. 
 Sorry, I... Troy let me in. 
 To what do I owe this unexpected visit? 
 What do you know about Sam Brukner? 
 Well, he's bombastic, uncouth, impossibly egotistical and yet somehow he has managed to assemble an amazing art collection. 
 The bulk of which he is planning to place at auction. 
 He's having a soirée at his apartment to showcase some of his items. 
 How do I get his account? 
 The same way you seduce anyone. 
 Make them think they're more important than they are. 
 You have it for three months. 
 I'll let you deduct the rent from the proceeds. 
 These are the phones, charger, everything you need. 
 Tommy. 
 That better be a goddamn mirage. 
 It was a surprise to me as well. 
 When were you planning to share the surprise with me? 
 This is exactly what I didn't want! 
 I don't believe this. 
 We've come this far, Tommy. 
 I don't know what you two are doing here but I'm going to tell you what I told Hassan. 
 I'll help you move the Gudea then I'm out, we're done, okay? 
 We're here to make money. As we did in Iraq. 
 As you did. 
 We were once a successful team. 
 We could do it again. 
 Pass. 
 Why does that make you so uncomfortable? 
 Because I've moved on. 
 And getting involved with you is count... 
 How do you say, "counterproductive"? 
 (speaking in foreign language) 
 Come on Tommy, once a thief always a thief. 
 Give these assholes some phones. 
 Excuse me. 
 Joanne, you going up? I'll see you in a minute. 
 Sam! 
 You look fantastic! 
 Thank you. This is fantastic. 
 An excellent way to whet everyone's appetite. 
 You like the fresh maids' outfits? 
 It was my idea. 
 Here's an idea. Tell me I have your account. 
 Roxy... 
 I know. Going through the motions because you want your selection of DeGraaf's to be seen as purely professional. 
 You were listening. 
 Is that why you invited Graham Connor? 
 I invited his boss. 
 You want me to kick him out? 
 Sam, I really need this. 
 You need this? 
 You father runs the place. 
 Yes. A lot of good that's done me. 
 Look, I think that you should have several drinks, relax, and enjoy yourself. Hm? 
 Guess Brukner's feeling his way toward a decision. 
 If he is, I think I have you beat. 
 I don't remember seeing your name on the guest list. 
 Arthur Davenport told me about it. 
 Hm, I don't remember seeing his name either. 
 How'd you get in? 
 I said I was with the catering company. 
 Can you tell Brukner you invited me? 
 I don't want the doorman getting in trouble. 
 Also, I need five minutes alone with him. 
 It seems like I'm doing a lot for you and you're doing exactly  nada  for me. 
 I will. I promise. 
 Please? 
 If this is about my account, I already told what's his name... 
 It's not. It's not. 
 Well, in a roundabout way, it kind of is. 
 You told me that I had to bring you something that Roxanna Whitman couldn't. 
 I'm in contact with someone who's interested in selling one of the statues of Gudea. 
 It's the only one available in the world. 
 If it's not something you want to explore, I understand. 
 And this conversation never happened. 
 It's probably more of a risk than you're willing to take. 
 How much? 
 Dad? 
 Before you say anything, I'm fine. 
 Fine? You had a heart attack. 
 A very minor one. 
 Mom's on her way. I called Clarissa. 
 I don't want this to get out. 
 If the chairman of DeGraaf's is perceived as lacking... vitality, it could be bad for business. 
 That should be the least of your concerns. 
 Any progress with Brukner? 
 I'll close him this week. 
 Isn't that what you said last week? 
 I'll close him. Trust me. 
 I expect all of my employees, including you, to excel. 
 Now you've hit some singles, you've hit some doubles. 
 I want to see a home run. 
 I suppose Miles is your idea of an all-star. 
 Don't measure yourself against Miles. 
 He has far more experience than you do. 
 More juice? 
 I'm fine. Thank you. 
 This must feel very, very unnatural for you. 
 What? 
 Being a caregiver. 
 He's asleep. 
 What'd the doctor say? 
 Why are you here? 
 That's an odd comment from a doctor. 
 He's going to be fine. I already called Clarissa. 
 There is no need for you to be here. 
 He's my father-in-law and my boss. 
 I care about him. 
 You're my brother-in-law and my boss. 
 I don't care about you. 
 (knocking on door) 
 I'm Dr. Rissman. 
 And you two are? 
 I'm Roxanna, Mr. Whitman's daughter. 
 Ah. 
 Miles Hewitt. Son-in-law. 
 Well, I have some good news. 
 The blockage is very small, blood flow is good. 
 Once we insert the stint, your father should be good to go. 
 Let me know if you have any other questions. 
 Thank you, doctor. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you, again. 
 Okay. 
 Leave. Or I will. 
 Good idea. 
 I'll let you know if his condition changes. 
 Excuse me. 
 Oh hi, Miss Whitman. Is everything okay? 
 Yes. I was just stretching my legs. 
 Is that Avery Swift in 4206? 
 He's an old friend. 
 I'm sorry. We're not allowed to give out patient information. 
 I understand. 
 Do you have kids? 
 I saw you were looking at a Deming Place pre-school site. 
 Yeah. One. 
 A three-year-old boy, Ethan. 
 Ethan. That's a lovely name. 
 Tough to get in? 
 1200 applicants for 80 spots. 
 So unless you know someone, pretty much impossible. 
 So unfair. 
 I just talked to Brukner. 
 He's still in play. 
 I figured you'd want to know. 
 I wished you'd asked me before doing that. 
 I would have told you not to. 
 Sometimes these things just kind of happen, you know? 
 Graham, we don't have to be friends. 
 In fact, I don't anticipate that ever actually happening. 
 Hi, Simone. 
 How you doing? 
 The least you can do is listen and learn instead of stumbling around and damaging established relationships. 
 Established relationships? 
 The guy doesn't even remember your name. 
 Hey, hey you want to listen while you look, imagine good times on writing those words? Here you go. 
 There should be a small smudge on the upper left corner, see? 
 And slight abrasion on the bottom. 
 You can see it in the catalogue photo. 
 You think this is a fake? 
 I know it's a fake. 
 I'll pull the video. 
 If it was stolen from under our noses, we'll need to bring in the police. 
 Do you see how quickly something like this goes downhill? 
 I don't think we need to involve the police. 
 That's a mistake. 
 Look, there were only a few people who had the lyrics envelope outside the case. 
 I don't consider 38 a few. 
 Sir, these are just the last 20. 
 Look, we go to the police, we risk scaring off potential clients. 
 There's four days until the auction. 
 That's four days to minimize the fallout. 
 What are you proposing? 
 Give me two days to get it back. 
 How exactly are you going to do that? 
 I did investigative work when I was in the military. 
 Sir, I was there. 
 A good chance I'll put it together going through the video. 
 Confidence is certainly one thing you're not lacking. 
 You get two days. No more. 
 If you fail, we go to the police. 
 Thank you. 
 Connor. 
 Someone told me you're from Bensonhurst. 
 That's right. 
 Yeah, I'm from Bed-Stuy. 
 So I know when someone's running game. 
 The difference here, is if things go bad, these people don't just break your legs. 
 They will ruin your life in ways you cannot imagine. 
 Do yourself a favor... 
 Drop the Sherlock Holmes routine. 
 Mr. Swift? 
 I'm Roxanna Whitman. Ash Whitman's daughter. 
 Oh. Oh, of course. 
 We spoke a few months ago about your family's collection. 
 Such a shame so few have seen it. 
 Those who have speak about it almost reverentially. 
 I couldn't agree with you more. 
 My family and I spent all our time squabbling about how to manage it. 
 I remember you telling me the other trustees had all passed away. 
 Judson died last May. 
 Or was it Richard? I... I'm not going to remember. 
 So now it's all in your hands. 
 Where do you want it to go? 
 Well I do know, I don't want it interred in the Newport cottage basement. 
 Paintings have a life of their own. 
 Van Gogh said that. 
 Yes. So true. 
 And you have a Van Gogh in your collection, isn't that right? 
 Oh, yes. 
 A wonderful artist. 
 
 
 
 Nurse : How you feeling today, Mr. Swift? 
 Oh, much better now I have two lovely ladies in my room. 
 (laughs) 
 Well, your vitals are normal. 
 And I told my husband about the call you made to Deming Place. 
 And he is just as grateful as I am. 
 Oh, I'm just glad I could help. 
 If there's anything you need, just press the call button, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 Of course. 
 You and I are fortunate. 
 We have been provided access to great art. 
 To be a complete human being you must embrace art. 
 My family didn't. They embraced bickering. 
 A collection like this needs to be seen. 
 To enhance our understanding of the human experience. 
 Well put, young lady. 
 If you auctioned your collection to fund a massive arts education program, what an incredible legacy that would be. 
 You would single-handedly be responsible for an entire new generation of art lovers. 
 What do you think? 
 You're here late. 
 How you doing? Want some Chinese? 
 No thanks. 
 They put in my authentications. Did I tell you that? 
 Melissa Walters did. 
 Good luck. She's a tough boss. 
 You were right. 
 I'm sensing a little tension from my fellow employees. 
 Not that I expected to be instantly challenged, but so far I haven't been asked to do anything beyond the capacity of a 10-year-old. 
 Yeah, a lot of that authentications work can be... 
 Tedious? 
 Yeah. 
 But I'd give them more than eight hours before your make up your mind. 
 A lot of the people you work with who will eventually relax and accept you. 
 Or they won't. 
 Did you hear about "The Who" lyrics being stolen? 
 No. 
 Well, I'm looking at everyone who handled the envelope. 
 So he just lifted right from the viewing room? 
 In broad daylight. 
 That's pretty ballsy. 
 You want to help out? 
 Do some chain-of-title research? 
 It's my second day. 
 I should probably stick to what they told me to do. 
 Is that a yes? 
 A Detective Washington wants to talk to you right away. 
 What about? 
 Good evening, Elizabeth. 
 Hi. 
 The lyrics theft. 
 Mason said he'd hold off on the cops for two days. 
 Yeah I convinced him that was a bad idea. 
 Come on. I'll take you down there. 
 Yes. 
 The chain-of-title thing. 
 Thank you. 
 What so he's... 
 The police station? He's not here? 
 Well he was, but you weren't. 
 Didn't think you'd find a 10 minute ride too much of a burden. 
 Mr. Swift? 
 I brought the documents you requested. 
 Do you need to sit up a little? 
 Mr. Swift, I need you to sign this, here. 
 Right here. 
 It's okay. Remember what we spoke about. 
 Remember your legacy. 
 Are you signing this of your own free will and volition? 
 Please serve as my witness? 
 I need you to verbalize. 
 Yes. 
 Mr. Swift, are you signing this of your own free will and volition? 
 I need you to say yes. 
 I need you to say yes. 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 You did the right thing. 
 Huh? 
 Thank you. 
 The Swift Collection. 
 Yes, The Swift Collection, in its entirety, including a never before seen Van Gogh. 
 Definitely not for attribution. 
 I understand you were the last employee to see the missing document. 
 That's right. 
 You sure you don't want a cup? 
 I'm fine. Thanks. 
 Mr. Thomas tells me that you facilitated access to 38 others? 
 Clients, yes. 
 But based on our surveillance video, I've pretty much cleared 30 of them. 
 Appreciate your crime-solving help but we'll decide who's in the clear. 
 (phone rings) 
 Hello? 
 Now that hard drive, is it on its way? 
 Uh, a soon as I get back to the office, I'll send it. 
 It's a beautiful thing. 
 (phone rings) 
 Where's the men's room? 
 Uh, it's just the Chinese food I had for dinner. 
 It's making a counter-attack. 
 Down the hall. 
 Thanks. 
 (door slams) 
 Ma? 
 Ryan! 
 Ryan, get down here! 
 Hey, douchebag! 
 You screwing around in the basement?! 
 (police sirens) 
 (phone vibrating) 
 Hey. Mr. Mason. 
 Yes, I spoke with the police. 
 I will. I hope so, too. 
 Okay. See you tomorrow. 
 Savage. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I feel fine. 
 Better than I have in years. What have I missed? 
 Well, I signed The Swift Collection. 
 Like you signed Bruckner? Meaning... maybe, possibly, sometime in the indeterminate future? 
 The drugs certainly mellowed you. 
 Well forgive my skepticism Roxanna but you did tell me twice that you signed Brukner when, in fact, you hadn't and now you're telling me that out of the blue, you signed an even bigger account. 
 The biggest. 
 The contract. 
 The Examiner says we're auctioning The Swift Collection. 
 Apparently Roxanna signed Avery Swift while I was sedated. 
 Avery Swift is dead. 
 He signed first. 
 The news got out pretty fast. 
 Did you commence the publicity campaign before or after he signed? 
 I didn't tell them. 
 Then who did? 
 You know we have a PR department for that, right? 
 Don't we want publicity? 
 There's something called the Internet, Miles, with a dozen auction house bloggers with inside sources. 
 Regardless, if The Examiner has it, everyone in the whole world knows. 
 Miles, maybe you want to get involved. 
 Jesus, Dad. 
 One question. 
 How? 
 Charm and hard work. You might want to try it. 
 Roxy? 
 Sam. I assume you're here to sign with us. 
 Two days ago you were telling me how much you needed my account. 
 The most important account of your career. 
 And then I have to go and read how you just signed The Swift Collection. 
 Sam, I didn't think that... 
 No, you didn't. That's my point. 
 I think you know that I only do business with people who are straight with me. 
 I am always straight with you, Sam. 
 The Swift account happened very suddenly. 
 I was summoned to the guy's deathbed. 
 Not that you care, but it was pretty damn traumatic for me. 
 The guy's 90 years old. 
 Everybody that age is about to croak. 
 I should have called you sooner. 
 Yes. 
 But should I have turned it down? 
 Hm... 
 Would you have wanted me to turn it down? 
 I'm pretty sure if I had you'd think I was a moron, that I hadn't listened to anything you taught me in this business. 
 "The Biggest Auction Of the Decade" line? 
 That's for the press. 
 You know that. You know it better than anyone. 
 If you sign, then I can have the contract in front of us in about 20 seconds. 
 I promise you will not be disappointed. 
 I'm already disappointed. 
 Look uh... if you want to just keep this, the client-account executive situation, that's... that's fine. 
 I don't. 
 May I take you to dinner to convince you of that? 
 Tonight? 
 I have to go on a quick business trip tonight. 
 I'm busy tonight too. 
 How about this weekend? 
 I'll check my calendar. 
 I checked chain-of-title. 
 Unknown provenance before 1990 and there's been three owners since. 
 The first one's dead, the second bought it from the estate but he's been in New Zealand for the last month, and the third one wouldn't need to steal the envelope. 
 He owns it. 
 An insurance scam? 
 No. No, he'd make a lot more letting it go to auction. 
 Thank you for helping me out on this. 
 I'm not done. 
 I also checked The Who '69 tour since the catalog said that's when the lyrics were written. 
 And that is when it got interesting. 
 The night of their Lake Geneva, Wisconsin concert, Their keyboardist was sick. 
 So they hired some local guy to come play with them. 
 It was all in the next day's paper. 
 The stolen lyrics were written on the back of a set list. 
 Something only a fill-in would have needed. 
 You are a great investigator. 
 (laughs) 
 So what's next? 
 Well, can't be too many Ken Dzerzhinskys in the world. 
 Only four in the U.S., but one in New York. 
 I know the photo's old, so I ran it through one of those sites that shows you what you'd look like as you age. 
 And that's probably what he'd look like now. 
 That's... 
 A very unattractive man. 
 That's one of the guys from the surveillance video. 
 2623? Yeah, I found it. 
 No, it's my dream house. 
 Thanks, Solomon. I owe you. 
 What do you want? 
 I'm looking for Ken Dzerzhinsky. 
 Why? 
 He's a friend of mine. 
 You only paid to see the hallway. 
 Living room tax is an extra 200. 
 Or you can give me that watch. 
 On my way out. 
 You can have the watch. 
 Okay? 
 Ken Dzerzhinsky? 
 I'm from Parke-Mason, the auction house. 
 We need to talk. 
 I don't know any Parke-Mason. 
 Cut the bull sh1t. We got you on tape. 
 I want the lyrics. The envelope. 
 You give me that and I'll leave and you can go back to sucking on this plastic dick. 
 Ken, I'm not screwing around. 
 Now! 
 You hear me? You hear me? Where is it? Where is it? 
 Tell me where it is. 
 It's in the bathroom. 
 Oh yeah? You got a bathroom here? Go find it. 
 What the hell you doing? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 I played with The Who! 
 The Who, man. 
 I thought it was going to change my life. 
 But it didn't. That envelope was mine! 
 Pete Townsend gave it to me. 
 If I want to flush it... 
 I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? 
 'Cause your gig with The Who didn't make you a star? Huh? 
 'Cause you're a crack head? 
 I got friends who got their legs blown off. 
 Who have nightmares every time they shut their eyes and guess what? 
 They don't turn into crack heads and sit around bitching about what might've been. 
 Screw you. 
 I'll take that watch now. 
 Where are the good ones? 
 I think a lot of them are good. 
 Mr. Swift especially liked the ship pictures. 
 Yes. The ship paintings are very nice. 
 I meant the famous ones. 
 The Monets, the Rembrandts, the Van Gogh This is all there is. 
 Very nice. Very, very nice. 
 Yes, it's a great addition to what I consider to be the finest collection in New York. 
 You obviously know what to buy and when. 
 I got the paperwork for you to sign. 
 Whoa, what is this? 
 You're getting way ahead of yourself here, kid. 
 Who said I'd signed with Parke-Mason? 
 You did. 
 No I did not. 
 Well, you said I was the... 
 You said I was the guy you wanted to work with. 
 What're you running a con? 
 I was talking about statues. 
 I already told Mason you'd sign. 
 Well, then you have a problem then, don't you? 
 Besides my account is worth a lot more than just one statue. 
 Isn't it? 
 I have more. 
 I have more. 
 Did you sell it? 
 Yeah. 
 Did everything go okay? 
 Fine. 
 Okay, look. 
 I was a bit of a dick before. 
 We all just need to be more careful. 
 We'll be more careful. 
 Good. 
 Then there's no reason we can't continue. 
 As long as we're all on the same page. 
 That's what I've been saying all along. 
 Why? Why the change of heart? 
 I found someone who wants the other pieces. 
 Ah so it's less about not being a dick and more about greed. 
 Is that a problem? 
 We obtained these items and got them here, not you. 
 And I found this place and the buyers. 
 See? Just like old times. 
 I'll handle selling the pieces. 
 You three just keep inside and stay out of trouble. 
 (laughs) 
 Don't give orders. 
 You're asking to join with us? 
 Not the other way around. 
 Your call. If you want me to step away, I will. 
 But I'm willing to bet that three Iraqis selling stolen art out of an abandoned body shop is going to end badly. 
 If anything happens to us, I'm willing to bet it will end badly for you as well Graham. 
 There is an item missing. 
 No there isn't. 
 I was looking at the bowl. 
 It's in with the loose pieces. 
 No, I saw the bowl. 
 There's supposed to be eight items in this bag. 
 Without the bowl, there should be seven there's only six. 
 The mask is missing. 
 It's probably in the basement. I'll find it. 
 Hey. 
 No, Shaliek. 
 (speaking in foreign language) 
 I need to talk to them alone about this. 
 Tommy, just go. I'll call you later. 
 Find the mask. 
 Now offered is lot number 218 a guitar once belonging to one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century, Jimi Hendrix. 
 A man Rolling Stone judged... 
 Oh maybe if we'd given Connor 24 hours, he might've retrieved something other than raw sewage. 
 The good news is we're still in the running to sign Bruckner. 
 Why wouldn't we? 
 Apparently he was about to sign with DeGraaf's, Graham convinced him to reconsider, which of course is meaningless unless he signs with us. 
 Oh, give him a break, Edward. 
 Saving an account we never even had certainly makes up for losing a million dollar item. 
 Hi. 
 I have 425. Bid is 425. 
 I see 435. Do I hear 450? 
 Bookman was not happy. So neither am I. 
 Well, he's here and bidding. 
 I know he is. 
 You got real lucky sending his kid that Hendrix video. 
 Has your Brukner contract been signed? 
 It's on his desk. 
 I want it on my desk. 
 Do I hear 470? 
 Yes, sir. 
 470 right here for this unparalleled piece of rock and roll history. 
 I have 470 from the gentleman in the blue suit. 
 Thank you Mr. Bookman. Do I hear 520? 
 (phone vibrating) 
 Anyone? 
 Fair and final warning then at $470,000. 
 Sold!
