 Previously on "The Art of More"... 
 And this used to be my favorite book. 
 Both : "Eloise." 
 Clarissa :  What are you doing here? You framed my husband. 
 I, I'm going to make sure that you get what you have coming. 
 I want you out of here now. 
 Davenport :  I have a client. 
 He might be willing to make a cash deal. 
 Nine million. 
 Joseph, I found a wonderful piece. 
 12 million euro. 
 I love it. 
 Nice doing business with you. 
 The U.S. Attorney's Office wants to talk with me. 
 They're on a witch hunt. 
 My pastor thinks I should cooperate. 
 Brukner :  If you were to use your influence  with a certain councilman in your congregation, I would be eternally grateful. 
 Hassan :  My family should be with me right now  but instead your immigration people are still holding them somewhere. 
 It's public information. You should be able to call to find out where they're being detained. 
 Clerk :  I've got no record of either in the system. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 See that kid? His mom, Joan, she used to work for me until Paul Rice's crew killed her. 
 I'll get your guy. 
 I will talk to my cousin about putting you in touch with al-Masrifi. 
 Shukran. 
 Lawyer 1 : That's unacceptable. 
 We could not have been clearer on our list of terms. 
 Lawyer 2 : Your terms are pipe dreams. 
 They're my client's wishes. 
 All I want... 
 Quiet, Trevor. 
 He's a best-selling artist who's made millions for this label, and he demands to be treated accordingly. 
 We've been more than fair, considering we made him a star. 
 You made him a star? 
 You don't think we have anything to do with it? 
 We'll take an extra 10 points on merch, you retain publishing. 
 Hold up a second. 
 T, please, let me handle this. 
 We already have publishing. I don't see the point. 
 The point is you get to keep T. 
 Otherwise, I'm taking him out of here. 
 You can't. 
 Watch me.

 (VOCALIZES T'S SONG) 
 (CHUCKLES) Story of my youth right there. 
 No, I... I mean I... I listened to this album nonstop in high school. 
 So did I. Until my dad found it and threw it in the trash. 
 Well, he was more of the target than the target demo. 
 So, we have the original, unedited master of the "Lion's Pride" album. 
 World doesn't even know it still exists. 
 Oh, but they'll wanna know. 
 It's literally one of a kind. 
 That's the angle we have to keep hitting. 
 It's a "one of." Piece of history. 
 Title Records wants us to be as noisy as possible, and so do I. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Um, Mister... 
 Uh, I mean, Royal T is here to see you. 
 Thank you, Evan. Send him in. 
 Tre. Roxanna Whitman. It's a pleasure. Please. 
 I go by "Trevor" now. 
 Better yet, "Mr. Sprewell." 
 Mr. Sprewell, it's an honor to meet you. 
 I'm a huge fan. 
 I hear you got my "Lion's Pride" master. 
 And that you plan to auction it off to the highest bidder. 
 Title Records has asked us to handle the sale on their behalf. 
 And we're thrilled. 
 Mm. And I'm not. 
 You see, that version of "Lion's Pride" has got no business seeing the light of day. 
 It's mine. 
 Technically, it's owned by Title Records. 
 I don't give a sh1t about your "technically." 
 You try and sell it, and I'm coming right back here with my team next time. 
 Martin : Um, um, I'm sorry, um, when... when you say your team, you... you mean... 
 Lawyers, asshole. 
 Mm-hmm. Right. 
 A van full of lawyers. 
 Scarier than any crew I ran with back in the day. 
 Trust me on that. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 Graham : I don't know what you want, but I have friends who will know if I'm gone too long. 
 It's not what we want, it's what you want, Graham. 
 You requested this meeting. 
 You work for al-Masrifi? 
 Come on. 
 I work for a buyer who has specific taste in antiquities. 
 Extremely rare tastes. 
 I've heard your boss can provide for that. 
 You were in the army, huh? 
 U.S. First Infantry, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I was in the army, too. 
 But on the other side. 
 My Republican Guard fought for Saddam. 
 What, are you gonna scare me? 
 Tell me how many Americans you killed? 
 Actually, I wasn't, but I can tell you how many of my friends died if you like. 
 Look, the politicians start the wars. 
 I'll let them do the apologizing. 
 I'm here for business. 
 Can we do business? 
 That's exactly the question I've been trying to answer. 
 Why come to us... rather than continuing to go through Hassan al Afshar? 
 Hassan had limited items. 
 I want more. 
 With who I know and what they want, there's no reason to stop making money. 
 For everyone. 
 You should know that moving on from al Afshar is one thing, break his trust, no big deal, breaking al-Masrifi's trust is quite another. 
 Do I have his trust or not? 
 We'll get back to you with prices and items. 
 Okay, wait a sec, wait a sec. 
 Cuts both ways. 
 I'm not agreeing to anything until I meet al-Masrifi himself. 
 You're talking to him right now. 
 We know where to find you, Graham. 
 (SPEAKING ARABIC) 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 sh1t. 
 Ramirez. 
 Graham :  I just had a meeting with a guy who called himself al-Masrifi. 
 He's Iraqi, middle-aged, ex-military. 
 I don't understand. 
 Who the hell was this guy? 
 That's what I'm asking you, the FBI agent. 
 Look, either you guys got the wrong damn guy with Paul Rice, or he's already on to you. 
 Goddammit. 
 Did he ask you who your buyer was? 
 No. He was just feeling me out. 
 Said he'd get in touch soon about next steps. 
 Good. Okay. 
 "Okay"? 
 These guys know where I live, Ramirez. 
 They were pretty damn clear I'm done if they find out I'm trying to play 'em. 
 Maybe they were Rice's watchdogs, but... 
 "But" what? 
 Don't you tell me you have no idea who I'm dealing with. 
 Look, just don't go anywhere or do anything until I call you. 
 sh1t. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Good morning. 
 Didn't I put you on leave? 
 Oh, I was catching up on work at home and I thought it'd be better to grab some files while it was quieter here, but, um, whatever you say, boss. 
 Oh, actually... 
 I have something for you. 
 Clarissa asked... that I return this. 
 She also asked that you stop calling her. 
 Or the children. 
 She wants nothing more to do with you. 
 Nothing. 
 When are you gonna stop? 
 And what do you suggest that I do? 
 Simply leave a company that I have been a part of for years? 
 Leave my family? 
 All this business? 
 This is your doing. 
 So, what I'm wondering is when are you gonna stop? 
 Sure I can't get you anything to drink? 
 We have an espresso machine, sparkling water, champagne... 
 Any reason we be popping corks on champagne? 
 Okay, I will cut to it then. 
 We are not able to remove your album from auction, but... 
 You're not even tryin'. 
 No, believe me, I wish you could have control of your masters too, but that's not the world we live in. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 "The world we live in." 
 We live in a world we create for ourselves. 
 Whatever you say you wish for, you're just falling in line for someone else. 
 Let me tell you somethin'. 
 I ain't no sheep. 
 "Sheep"? 
 Seriously? 
 Who the hell do you think you are? 
 A guy tired of being played for a fool. 
 So, stop playing the fool. 
 Have a nice day, Ms. Foley. 
 (RELAXATION MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Jesus Christ! 
 (CHORTLES) Sorry. 
 I'm sorry, baby. 
 All good. I was done. 
 What are you doing meditating in the morning? 
 Why don't you do that in the afternoon when everybody's trying to stick little, tiny daggers in your back? 
 It's about setting your day off correctly. 
 Oh. 
 Coffee and a sh1t does that for me. 
 Delightful, Dad. 
 So, um... how long do you have off from medical school? 
 Hey, I did offer to stay at a hotel. 
 No, no, no, no, I... No, no, I'm so happy you're here. 
 I'm so glad. Really. 
 I was just thinking about, um, your hubby, uh... um... 
 Fedora Face. Uh... 
 Dave. 
 Dave. 
 He must be lonely. 
 Dave hasn't worn a fedora in years. 
 And, um... we're on a break. 
 "A break." Olivia, married people don't take breaks. 
 They got a different name for that. 
 Yeah, I've heard Mom use a ton of words for it. 
 And for you. 
 Touche. 
 (DOORBELL CHIMES) 
 One second. 
 Hey, can we get lunch later? 
 Yeah, it depends. 
 Brukner : What took you so long? 
 I was busy. At home. 
 On a Sunday. 
 Oh, oh, I'm sorry. 
 I hope I didn't take you away from something too important. 
 It's fine. Henry was on a business trip and I was doing some work for the museum anyway. 
 Hm. 
 What's the emergency? 
 Well, I happen to have the most incredible, fabulous news that I know you're gonna love. 
 Your favorite Afrikaner artist, he got over his heterophobia with me and he learned how to say yes. 
 Heller? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Smug little prick, but, you know, I want to make you happy. 
 I... I... And I am. 
 This could have been relayed in a text. 
 Yeah, but I have ulterior motives. 
 Come on in. Come on. 
 Hello. 
 She another new hire? 
 I like your jealousy. 
 But, uh, no, this is my freeloading kid. 
 "Jealousy"? 
 "Freeloading"? 
 Olivia, Isabel. Isabel, Olivia. 
 Sup? 
 Oh, sh1t! We're almost late for church! 
 So look... 
 Did you say "church"? 
 I'm gonna... Yeah. 
 I... I gotta go. 
 And, uh, I wanna look good, and that's where you two come in. 
 Nobody's got a beef with God, right? 
 Look, I got you Heller. 
 And look, you can meditate the entire time we're there and then afterwards, I want to talk to you about your divorce, your... your break, or uncoupling. Whatever you want to call it. 
 What... whatever you want, darling. 
 All right? 
 Yeah. 
 Deal? 
 I'll get dressed. 
 Boss doesn't take a day off, huh? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Bosses never do. 
 What's your excuse? 
 I needed to get out of my apartment. 
 Mm. 
 Everything okay? 
 (SIGHS) Never better. 
 Life is just grand on the tippy-top floor. 
 Anything you want to talk about? 
 Talk, talk, talk. Oh... (CHUCKLES) 
 Graham, I just, um... 
 But I just can't, can't, can't. 
 You're drunk. 
 I am quoting "Eloise." 
 And, uh... 
 I have to be going, going, going. 
 And where exactly are you headed like this? 
 To speak with my mother who's teaching an art class. 
 And I have to catch her before she heads home, so... 
 Well, you're not driving. 
 Okay, you drive. 
 No. 
 No, I'm gonna call you a cab. 
 Where's the art class? 
 Long Island. 
 This is not where I saw myself today. 
 All I smell are cough drops. 
 Is that your mom over there with the Watercolor Wonder Crew? 
 That's her. 
 You should get back to the city. 
 Clearly you have things to do. 
 Yeah, you clearly have to be here. 
 I'm fine. Go on, do your thing. 
 Um... the way you found me earlier... 
 It's nothing we need to talk, talk, talk about. 
 (CHURCH MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Damn you, Sam. 
 You cannot damn me in church. 
 He might be listening. 
 I'm sure He's learned to cover his ears. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 There he is. 
 Good to see you, Reverend. 
 A man of his word. 
 Yeah. 
 I brought along my beautiful daughter to hear your sermon. 
 Wow. Sam, I didn't know you were a family man. 
 God, family, country. That's the way I was raised. 
 Well put. 
 And this must be your charming wife. 
 Uh, curator. 
 Sorry? 
 Um, I'm the curator for Sam's new museum. Isabel. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, yes, I did hear talk about this new museum. 
 That's a fine endeavor. 
 Art for the people. (CHUCKLES) 
 I like it. 
 You should get ready to begin. 
 Uh, this is my son, Noah. 
 Son of a preacher man. Bet you get that all the time. 
 Yes, I've heard it. 
 Isabel. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Olivia. 
 Reverend Cobb : Sam... why don't you come sit right up front here? 
 Think you're gonna enjoy my sermon. 
 Can't wait. 
 You handled that lame joke well. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Yeah, I've heard it just a few times. 
 See you later. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Joseph? 
 Yes. 
 Hello, Walter. How are you? 
 I'm doing just great. 
 So nice to hear from you. 
 Sorry to bother you, but I have a little something to discuss with you if you have time to meet. 
 Joseph, I'm so sorry, but I'm back in New York now. 
 I know. 
 I'm in New York as well. 
 Man : She's never been in an accident and my brother's a mechanic, so she had her regular checkups. 
 The odometer says 150, but it was all highway. 
 I only brought her into the city a couple years ago. 
 I don't like driving in the city. 
 There's too many cars. 
 All those damn Uber drivers now. 
 sh1t. 
 Is that your plan? 
 No. 
 My family and I, we're leaving New York. 
 I'll take it. 
 Don't forget this. It's beautiful work. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you. 
 Have a good night. 
 
 
 
 Oh, you didn't paint anything, Jellybean. 
 Like I said, I'm here to talk to you, Mom, not do arts and crafts. 
 (SIGHS) Okay. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Clarissa isn't speaking to me. 
 I know things have been a little tense lately. 
 I need you to help her understand. 
 Everything. 
 Are you talking from the birthday party or... 
 I'm talking about the last 18 years, Mom. 
 Man : Hey! 
 Come in here, would ya? 
 Talkin' to me? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 No, Bobby De Niro just went by. Yeah, you. 
 You're new here. 
 Yeah. Uh, no, no, no. 
 Uh, no, I don't... I don't work here. 
 I'm... I'm with someone who's visiting someone else. 
 Sounds a bit complicated or maybe it's just... really boring. 
 Is there something I can help you with? 
 Yes, there is. 
 Do you know any Shakespeare? 
 Uh... to be or not to be, that's the question. 
 Question is, can you run lines with me? 
 I'm doing a production of "Hamlet" at the local theater. 
 Small production. I play the ghost. 
 Now I just need to run the lines. 
 I'm sorry, I... I can't 'cause I'm... I'm with someone. 
 Oh, come on now. 
 Listen. 
 I'm offering you this one and only, last remaining vanilla chocolate swirl pudding, man. 
 Well, I don't know how I can turn that down. 
 There you go. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I... I gotta warn you, I'm... I'm not that good. 
 Neither was my second wife. Ba-dum-dum. 
 Name's Fox Spencer. 
 Graham Connor. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Good to meet you. 
 In Luke 18:23, the Lord says to the wealthy, "Sinners, sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor. Then you will find your treasures in Heaven. Only then will you be a sinner no more." 
 Amen. 
 Churchgoers : Amen! 
 I gotta pee. 
 Now, Brother Brukner... would you care to join me up here at the podium? 
 Oh. 
 I'm just a listener today. 
 Reverend Cobb : Please, don't be modest. 
 Come on up here. 
 Come on up here and share some good news with this fine Christian community. 
 Thank you. 
 The service is almost done.

 (CHEERING) 
 My hour is almost come. 
 When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames must render up myself. 
 Your line. Yeah. 
 sh1t. Sorry. Uh, okay, so... 
 "My hour is almost come when I to..." 
 (MUMBLES) 
 Sorry. I lost it. 
 We're just reading lines. 
 I'm not judging your Hamlet. 
 You mind if we don't do this? 
 We don't have to. 
 Thank you. I haven't read lines since I was a kid. 
 I got the... the lead in this play in middle school. 
 "Art Town." You know that one? 
 Oh, he's a stage manager, he's pulling all the strings. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah. Well, uh, I got out on stage and saw the crowd, and, uh... 
 I just froze. Everything went blank. 
 I just stood there. 
 While everyone laughed at me. 
 Aw, you're still not carrying that around, are ya? 
 Um, um, no offense, but... 
 There's gotta be, uh... more than that. 
 My dad was there for that, you know. 
 He saw that. 
 Failing on stage, everyone laughin' at me. 
 And then two days later, he was shot and killed. 
 Oh, my God. 
 So... they're kind of linked in my head. 
 Whoa. 
 Ah, sh1t, kid. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hm. 
 My, uh, my first wife... died at 40. Carcinoma. 
 That's not exactly that same, but I know what it's like... to be cruisin' along and... when suddenly... something happens and your life is changed forever. 
 Yeah, I lost someone else recently, too. 
 Well, that's... tragedy and destiny. 
 Faith, karma, God, everybody's got a different name for it. 
 Me, I called it shit-house luck. 
 And I spent the next 10 years pissed off, feeling sorry for myself. 
 You're a little pissed off too, eh? 
 What brought you out of it? 
 I realized it was a huge waste of time and it was a total drag. 
 Doesn't have to be more complicated than that. 
 And I bet it is, you know, sometimes. 
 Don't you think? More complicated? 
 Is it really? 
 I'm living here in the ultimate waiting room, and trust me, it's a crappy way to live. 
 But it's life. 
 And I got it. 
 I think it's great that you want to talk things through. 
 I mean, you and Clarissa are sisters. 
 It's not about talking, it's about being heard. 
 Well, I've always heard you. 
 You've heard what you wanted to hear. 
 I don't think that's very fair. 
 I'd say not fair is getting raped by your future brother-in-law and then having your mother not believe you. 
 It's being 15 and made to feel like you're the drunk kid who probably isn't remembering it quite right. 
 Not fair... is doubting yourself every day for years. 
 And the whole time having to decide between leaving your family and working next to the guy who did that to you. 
 Uh... 
 I took you to therapy. 
 Once. 
 You weren't... interested. 
 Because you weren't interested. 
 It was inconvenient for you. 
 I wanted you to be the liar. 
 Because if you were lying, then that's all it was. 
 If it was just a lie, I could deal with that. 
 But if it was the other... then that meant that I had completely failed you. 
 I'm so sorry, Roxanna. 
 Do you believe me? 
 Will you say it? 
 I believe you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How'd it go? 
 Good. 
 It was, uh, colorful. 
 Good. 
 Yeah, for me too, actually. 
 Guess it's just one of those days in the universe. 
 What have you got there? 
 This is a pudding. 
 It's, uh, chocolate vanilla swirl. 
 Huh. 
 Best of both worlds. 
 It's for you, actually. 
 For me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, so what makes your pancakes so darn special? 
 Well, you're just gonna have to wait and find out. 
 Ah. 
 You want savory or sweet? 
 Mm, sweet please. 
 Okay, a little sugar, a little raspberry jam? 
 Yes! That sounds delicious. 
 Hey, Ro... Rox? 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, uh, my mom just texted me. 
 I was supposed to be at her house for dinner like an hour ago. 
 I totally forgot. 
 Do you mind if we do this another time? 
 No, that's fine. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 Marwan. It's Graham Connor. 
 I need you to get a message to al-Masrifi for me. 
 I'm sorry, but I don't have a way to contact him. 
 Just call your cousin! Please, man! 
 Listen, I already did what you asked of me once. 
 They took me to some Halal butcher, it's probably a live meat market. 
 From the ride over, I'm guessing was Brooklyn. 
 Does any of that ring a bell? 
 Look, please, I... 
 I have to speak to him. 
 Martin, have you seen Alesha? 
 Uh, yeah. She bailed like an hour ago. 
 Hm... 
 I want to get our lawyers on the phone. 
 See if we can find room to make it work for Royal T. 
 Seriously? Like pull the sale? 
 Ideally, no, but maybe there's a way to work out a clause so that it's for the buyer's private use only. 
 Wow. Um, okay. 
 I gotta say, I'm kinda surprised you wanna play ball after all these tweets. 
 What tweets? 
 He's been tweeting, vlogging, snapping, you name it, all about us all day, and it's not especially nice stuff. 
 Yeah, I know, it... it got kind of personal. 
 Sorry. 
 You still want me to call the lawyers? 
 Definitely. 
 Okay. 
 Brother Brukner. 
 Two visits in one day. 
 I wasn't expecting that. 
 You're runnin' out of space here on your wall. 
 Well, maybe I should build my own museum. 
 Hm. Yeah. 
 Did you play them like you played me today? 
 Because that's a hell of a way to ask for a bribe. 
 Ooh, thou shalt not accept a bribe. 
 A bribe blinds the clear sigh... 
 Oh, let's cut the bullshit, all right? 
 Look, I need you to shut Councilman Dortch's mouth and you need money, so... 
 (SIGHS) let's make a deal. 
 Hm. 
 That little thing earlier, that was just playing with you. 
 I know. 
 See, what I want is far more important than money. 
 I want you to move your museum into my neighborhood. 
 I already bought a building. 
 Sell it. 
 It'd be like a flip. 
 I know it's coming... but what is it that you get out of this? 
 My community gets access to free art. 
 Excitement. 
 Inspiration. 
 These are the people that will be inspired by your outsider art. 
 It just so happens I've got the perfect property for it. 
 Mm, there it is. 
 You want me to buy a piece of sh1t property. 
 I think I'd prefer that than Councilman Dortch testifying against you in court. Wouldn't you? 
 Don't move. Don't move. 
 Put your hands on the wheel. 
 All right, okay, okay. 
 You're taking me to see my family. 
 I don't have an ankle holster. 
 Good. 
 Drive. 
 (ENGINE STARTS) 
 They're safe. 
 All right? You don't have to worry. 
 Stop lying to me. 
 I know they're not in ICE custody as you promised. 
 You liar! 
 Yeah, well, you never would have been able to get 'em out of ICE anyway. 
 They would have been trapped. 
 They would have been home with me if it weren't for you! 
 Easy, easy. 
 All I'm trying to tell you is that I'm doing you a favor by keeping them in a safehouse. 
 Take me there. 
 We're almost there. 
 And you'll see I wasn't lying. 
 If there is even a single hair out of place on their heads when we get there, I will kill you. 
 That is my promise to you. 
 Well, fair enough, Hassan. 
 I'd probably do the same thing if I were you. 
 But, if you want me to take you to your family a whole lot faster, I'd appreciate you letting up on that pistol against my rib cage. 
 I'm having a little trouble breathing, if you know what I mean. 
 Thank you. 
 Stop! 
 (BRAKES SCREECH) 
 Hey! 
 You crazy, you almost hit those kids! 
 Kramer. It's Washington. 
 You know that smuggler you were looking for? 
 I just shot him. 
 (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS) 
 Joseph, so sorry I'm late. 
 Ah. 
 How are you? 
 Fine. 
 Thank you for meeting with me. 
 Certainly. It's always a pleasure to see you. 
 You were first on my list of people to see in New York. 
 Oh? 
 Can I get you something, sir? 
 Ah, yes, um, can I have a club soda, please? 
 My pleasure. 
 Thank you. 
 So... to what do I owe this special honor? 
 If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have my favorite piece of art. 
 Ah, still enjoying the Ruscha then. 
 Very much so. 
 Good. 
 I need you to get me another painting. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'll be in New York on business for the next few months and I want to buy a new piece while I'm here. 
 Well, I'd, uh, be only too happy to help you, Joseph. 
 Another Ruscha, you think? 
 Well, I think it's best to uh... 
 Thank you very much. 
 I think we should wait and see what, uh, what my friends can turn up. 
 We don't want to get locked into anything. 
 One should always have an open mind. 
 Be willing to see whatever opportunity presents itself, huh? 
 Yes. Precisely. 
 The boyfriend in Croatia... 
 Silas... is he no longer in the picture? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Brukner : If you keep working so hard, you're not gonna need me anymore. 
 Who says I do? 
 I have more good news. 
 Do I need to pour more wine? 
 We are moving the museum to East New York. 
 (GASPS) Reverend Cobb's neighborhood. 
 I knew you had an angle! 
 I just wish you would have told me, because this is my museum. 
 What? You're mistaken. 
 It is mine. 
 See, that's the problem. 
 You think everything in the world is yours. 
 You think I'm yours. 
 No, I do not. No. 
 You talk like it, you act like it. 
 Oh, maybe I act like it. Maybe. 
 Maybe that's what I would like, but no. No. 
 Is that why you hired me? 
 I think you know why I hired you. 
 And I think you like the way I talk to you. 
 You have no idea what I like. 
 You barely know me. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 Sam, you have to go. 
 Please. 
 You have to go, Sam. 
 I've got a lot of work to do. 
 I'll see you during business hours. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Just a minute. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Sorry. New Drake album. 
 Really, really good stuff. You heard it? 
 I prefer my rap with a little bit of honesty. 
 That kid grew up on a Nickelodeon soundstage. 
 Not entirely. 
 But I'm glad you brought up the issue of honesty... 
 Seeing as you're facing a pretty serious case of libel for your online attacks. 
 You threatening me with court? Really? 
 Here's the thing, Trevor. 
 I actually sympathize with your standpoint. 
 You create something, you should own it. 
 Exactly. 
 It's my work and my voice. 
 Which you get to share with the world. 
 That's pretty lucky. 
 It ain't luck. 
 Either way... nobody should be able to take that away from you. 
 I agree. Problem is, you signed a contract with Title Records allowing them to do just that, so all this is between you and them. 
 And you're here anyway, right? 
 Happy to reap your little profits. 
 No, I'm not. 
 In fact, I'd instructed my lawyers to find a solution. 
 Then you started attacking me and my company online. 
 That was the wrong move. 
 I won't be bullied. 
 That's my voice. 
 Fine. I'll see you in court. 
 No, you won't. 
 'Cause if you had a case, you wouldn't be tweeting. 
 (DOORS OPEN) 
 I'm curious... how you found us. 
 (DOORS CLOSE) 
 It's an acquired skill. 
 Hm. 
 My buyer is very interested in what you're offering. 
 He'll pay two million for the whole lot. 
 The price for that collection is 8 million in Bitcoins. 
 The Assyrian tablet is the most valuable item and it's worth what, 500k? 
 The Assyrian tablet is 5,000 years old, Mr. Connor. 
 Actually, it's Sumerian, not Assyrian. 
 That is, if it's real. 
 You're accusing me of selling fakes? 
 No. No, not all of them. 
 That's why we think two million, 2.5 tops, is more than a generous offer. 
 Now look, if you're not willing to negotiate or be real with me, then f*ck it, the deal's off, okay? 
 Wait. 
 You gonna take the offer? 
 I said "wait." 
 Man : Why are trying to f*ck me, Graham? 
 My associate was misinformed about which Mesopotamian era the tablet comes from. 
 That does not mean it's a reproduction. 
 And it's worth four million alone. 
 Wait a minute. I've seen you around the auction houses. 
 Paul Rice. 
 You're al-Masrifi? 
 You didn't answer my initial question. 
 Yeah, I know, I know. 
 I'm just trying to protect myself. 
 I always want to know who I'm dealing with. 
 Okay? 
 Now that everything is out on the table, I don't see why I can't get my buyer up to eight million. 
 Hm. 
 Well, I like your strategy. 
 Sound. 
 Makes me wonder who your buyer is. 
 So, I'm sure. 
 Oh, you know I can't tell you that. 
 You're really messing with the way I like to do business, Graham. 
 The name of your buyer. 
 Paul, please. 
 There are 15, maybe 20 millionaires in this city who'd even want these items. 
 You and I both know who they are. 
 So... just give me his name, and we can move on from this, Graham. 
 And you can leave this room. 
 Sam Brukner. 
 Who did you just say? 
 Samuel Brukner is my buyer. 
 Sam Brukner.
