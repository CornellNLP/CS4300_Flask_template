 Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 What, you've never heard of a girl who came home safe and sound after being abducted 13 years ago? 
 I'm Ophie by the way. 
 I'm Bird. 
 Bird, I thought you were my friend. 
 I thought you were mine. 
 It's over with David. 
 Fingers crossed she can leave all of this behind like the nightmare, I'm sure it's been. 
 (Sighing) I love you more. 
 What do you think? 
 It's pretty cool, right? 
 I get free slushies, and I get all the microwave burritos that I can eat. 
 That turns out to be fewer than I thought. 
 Well, I'm really happy you're here. 
 Not as happy as me. 
 What I don't understand, really, is... why you moved here. 
 Well, the free burritos, as I mentioned. 
 Max, you moved here from a different state. 
 You got a new job, new apartment. 
 That's a lot of change for somebody who only owns one t-shirt. 
 I own more than one t-shirt. 
 They're just all the same as each other. 
 Did something happen? 
 You can tell me if it did. 
 Actually, I think you're the one person in the world that I cannot tell. 
 Okay, well, now you have to tell me. 
 No, I promised I wouldn't. 
 Max... you're never gonna win this. 
 We can either go back and forth for as long as it takes for you to tell me, or we can save us both a lot of time, and you can just tell me now. 
 I moved because I'm worried about you. 
 Why? 
 Is it because of that crash guy? 
 No, no, no. 
 I'm not worried about him. 
 Okay, then what? 
 I think it... that it's bad enough that you... lost everything in your life once, and I just... 
 I don't think you should have to go through that again. 
 Why would I have to go through that again? 
 If Lori showed up. 
 What? 
 Max, you saw her? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Where? 
 At the gas station off the interstate. 
 That's why I came back. 
 You know, I... your mom is here. 
 I thought she left. 
 She wants to. 
 And she wants you to go with her, but I wasn't sure if that's what you wanted. 
 Is that what you really want?

 So, uh, just be clear this is your truck? 
 It's not stolen? 
 Why would I steal a piece of crap like this? 
 Why would you steal anything? 
 Look, I've apologized. 
 I thought when you asked to see me, that we were moving on. 
 Well, we're not moving on. 
 I just... I just need a favor. 
 I can't yes or no until I know what the favor is. 
 Okay, look, I just found out my mom is... well, I-I don't know where exactly, but, um, possibly close. 
 That's great. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm happy for you, really. 
 Is there anything I can do to help? 
 Well, I was thinking she's probably using a different identity now, and that maybe you knew people who help with that? 
 You don't like that I'm a criminal, until you need a criminal. 
 No, look... 
 Look, I just wanna find my mom, okay? 
 I know you know what that feels like. 
 Send me a picture of her. 
 I'll ask around. 
 Thank you. 
 But, listen, you wanna find a criminal, ask a cop. 
 They know all of them, and you've got one at home. 
 Yeah, like Elizabeth's really gonna help me with this. 
 She would if you didn't treat her like the enemy. 
 Stop pushing her away. 
 Let her get close, and she'll drop her guard. 
 You'll get a lot more out of her if you start acting like a friend. 
 Or even her daughter. 
 Be careful... 
 You're starting to think like a criminal. 
 (Boy) No, no, no, no, no. 
 You're wrong, you're wrong, you're just insane. 
 (Girl)  What? 
 You're wrong, you're just embarrassing yourself. 
 You're embarrassing yourself. 
 Grant? 
 My sister's here, let's ask her. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Jordan Belfort or Travis Bickle? 
 What? 
 Jordan Belfort or Travis Bickle? 
 Or Jake LaMotta. 
 Honestly, the worst DeNiro is still better than the best DiCaprio. 
 Uh, hello, you're forgetting "The Departed." 
 No, I'm not. 
 What does your sister think? 
 Me? 
 Yeah. 
 Aren't you kinda young for those movies? 
 Hey, I'm Carter. 
 Regan. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Hey, you didn't tell me you had a girlfriend. 
 What? 
 Why would you... 
 What? 
 I gotta go. 
 Grant, it's okay. 
 See ya. 
 Don't. 
 Why would you do that? 
 What, what did I say? 
 You called her my girlfriend. 
 What do I do now? 
 What do I say? 
 Calm down, this is not a big deal. 
 What's a bigger deal than calling someone your girlfriend, huh? 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is so cute. 
 Look at you freaking out. 
 No, but, seriously, we can fix this. 
 Um, okay, who is she? 
 She's a fellow film geek I met online. 
 Okay. 
 We have this sorta informal movie club. 
 We have discussions that turn into debates. 
 She's super smart. 
 She notices a lot of the stuff I miss. 
 She makes me angry, but then she makes me laugh. 
 I can talk to her for hours. 
 Armadillo. 
 I hate to break it to you, but... she's your girlfriend. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 (Door opens) Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You're up. 
 Yeah. 
 Looks like we're both working late. 
 Yeah, I caught a call on my way out the... you don't care. 
 No, I do. 
 You do, since when? 
 I don't know. 
 Since... since you made me come down to the police station and apologize to everyone, and I realized that there aren't a lot of women there, are there? 
 That's true, there aren't. 
 And, from what I could tell, you're pretty high-ranking. 
 Well, yes. 
 And you're above Gabe's dad, right? 
 Yes, she is. 
 They used to be partners, but you've been above him for a while now, right? 
 Uh, you're up, too. 
 See, I thought everyone was going to be asleep. 
 I waited up. 
 You've been coming in late every night, it seems. 
 Well, things keep coming up at work. 
 I just got back from a crime scene, in fact. 
 You know, I'd, um... I'd actually really love to come with you to a crime scene one day. 
 Maybe on, uh, "take your daughter to work" day. 
 Well, if you're serious, I could bring you on a ride-along, but that entails being in a squad car all day with me. 
 Okay, when? 
 Tomorrow is my day off. 
 You're taking a day off. 
 That's great. 
 You've been working such long hours lately. 
 Yeah, I feel grimy. 
 I'm just gonna jump in the shower. 
 We'll talk later? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Something going on with you two? 
 Nothing, absolutely nothing. 
 Wait here, I'm just gonna sign out some equipment. 
 Okay. 
 (siren ringing) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I didn't expect to see you today. 
 I'm taking Carter on a ride-along. 
 Oh. 
 Nice. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Hey, I think it's, uh, great to see you spending some time with your mom. 
 What? 
 I was just saying, um, I think it's great to see you spending some time with your mom. 
 Elizabeth. 
 Right, she told me that's what you call her. 
 That... that's what I call her. 
 Hey... I just wanna say I know we got off on the wrong foot, but maybe... 
 Now, would that be the one where you're a creepy predator who stalks teenage girls? 
 Hey, look, I only did... 
 Or the one where you prepare to arrest my mom right in front of me. 
 I thought you were trying to put all that behind you. 
 I am, I just... when I look at your face, I have a really hard time not picturing it in the side-view mirror of your car watching me. 
 Oh, somebody wants you over there. 
 Who? 
 Me. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 ♪ 
 Where are we? 
 This is a tactical training facility. 
 This is where the magic happens. 
 I thought we'd be able to go over a few basics, just in case we were called to a crime scene. 
 This is a battering ram. 
 Wow, you should keep one of those in the house in case you wanna get into my room. 
 Oh, I do. 
 The most important thing is momentum. 
 Wow. 
 How'd you do that? 
 My secret is I just imagine someone's face on the door. 
 Bet I can imagine whose face that was. 
 Listen, Carter, I'm off the clock today. 
 Maybe you can be, too. 
 Yeah, okay, sorry. 
 Okay. 
 I'll put this back. 
 Um, can I... can I try? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 You know I'm thrilled that we're doing this together. 
 I was hoping that we'd have some... 
 (grunting) 
 Well... now we're both off the clock. 
 (door opening) 
 So, you sure this is okay? 
 Toby, relax. 
 Elizabeth's not here. 
 Nobody will be here for hours. 
 What is her issue with me? 
 What have I ever done except shield her from the truth when your career was tanking. 
 Do you have to put it that way? 
 In the past tense is how I put it. 
 Note to God, in my next life, I do not wanna represent writers. 
 Good luck with that. 
 Here. 
 Open it. 
 See what happiness feels like. 
 I have always loved your office. 
 Very "writerly." 
 You know, if Ernest Hemingway had an office like this, he never would've killed himself. 
 Oh, this feels good. 
 This feels really good. 
 Yeah, and that's just the first one. 
 There are three more. 
 Not counting royalties, not counting the paperback, not counting the best-seller bonus, and not counting... (singing) Hollywood. 
 Just trying to decide when the best time to show this to Elizabeth is. 
 Should I do it before or after I tell her I want a divorce? 
 Gasp. 
 Embellish. 
 She's cheating on me. 
 Double gasp. 
 For the second time. 
 Go on. 
 I didn't really blame her the first time. 
 My career was, as you said, tanking, and she was driving around all night with her Latin lapdog. 
 She was this close to leaving me when we found Carter. 
 Then what? 
 Then she ended it with him, for a minute. 
 Then we had a big fight about money, and next thing I know she's "working late" and taking showers as soon as she gets home. 
 I just can't stand sleeping in the same bed with her and him. 
 But, now, I have this. 
 Except you don't. 
 Toby, what are you doing? 
 I'm protecting you. 
 But the check... she has to see the check. 
 That's how she knows how wrong she is about me. 
 And then she gets to take half of it. 
 I'm sorry, David, you can't have this check until you and Elizabeth are legally separated. 
 So, behind this door, there are cardboard cut-outs. 
 Some are good guys and some are bad guys. 
 You don't wanna hit the good guys. 
 Just the bad guys. 
 You ready? 
 Born ready.

 (Firing continues) 
 (Glass shattering) 
 How'd I do? 
 Well, let's see. 
 Uh, you didn't hurt any of the good guys or the bad guys. 
 However, you did maim that lamp, you injured that painting, and you killed this potted plant.

 Hey, Bird, it's me. 
 What are you doing? 
 Well, I'm at a crime scene. 
 (Laughing) 
 No, but this time it wasn't me. 
 Listen, what are you doing later? 
 Oh. 
 Will Crash be there? 
 (Scoffing) No, we're not hooking up. 
 I just wanna speak to him.

 Oh, my God, there's a dead body.

 Wait, that... that was a dead body under the sheet? 
 Yes. 
 And his wife was just right there watching him? 
 My God, that was horrible. 
 I know. 
 Can you find out who killed him? 
 I already know. 
 She did. 
 What? 
 Her husband was abusing her. 
 She wanted to leave, he was coming after her, and she stabbed him. 
 Oh, my God. 
 And she continued to stab him even after he was dead. 
 Wait, so you knew the whole time you were hugging her that she was a killer? 
 There's not always a black and white, good guys and bad guys. 
 She did what she did because she was scared. 
 That's really compassionate. 
 Well, like, how do you decide, you know, which criminals you treat like human beings and which you pursue like animals? 
 What do you mean, when did I ever... 
 Well, say, for example, I wanted to get someone on the list of felons who get to see your warm and fuzzy side. 
 Like, how would I go about that? 
 Lori. 
 You hate her so much, but maybe you wouldn't if you understood the reasons why she did what she did. 
 I would. 
 Why? 
 How can you show that woman over there, who murdered her husband so much compassion, but yet you can't show the same compassion to the woman who raised me? 
 I am who I am because of that woman. 
 No, that's not true, Carter. 
 I knew you for three years, and I can tell you this is the person you would've been no matter what. 
 I just wanted one day, one day without her. 
 That's impossible. 
 It's never gonna happen. 
 But for a moment there, it was just you and me, and we made each other laugh... something that I thought was impossible to happen, and I loved it. 
 I loved it. 
 Thank you for a part of the day that was mine. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, how'd it go? 
 Oh, it was good. 
 Then it went bad. 
 I don't think I moved the needle. 
 Didn't stay late at the office tonight? 
 Mm, I wanted a nice night at home. 
 That looks good. 
 Can I have one? 
 Sure. 
 No mustard, though, right? 
 Right. 
 How was your day? 
 Uneventful. 
 Just sitting and writing, and then deleting what I wrote 'cause it sucked. 
 I'm sure it didn't. 
 Well, if you'd read it, you'd agree. 
 I used to read your stuff. 
 You said that you valued my opinion. 
 Because back then it was positive. 
 Well, my opinion of this sandwich is that, it is fantastic. 
 I'll take it. 
 I'll take whatever I can get these days. 
 David, come on. 
 You're the one that shuts himself up in his office all day and into the night and doesn't tell me what he's doing. 
 Do you tell me what you do in your office? 
 Ask me anything. 
 I'll tell you anything you wanna know. 
 Somehow I doubt it. 
 David! 
 What did I say... tell me what I said. 
 
 
 
 Tay... Oh, hey. 
 Didn't know you were here. 
 I'm quizzing Taylor on SAT vocabulary flash cards. 
 I'm really uncomfortable. 
 You guys are moving way too fast.

 Um, no. I just came to tell you I need the car tonight. 
 Okay, bye.

You can buy them on the internet now. She probably has a lot of different ones. I'm sorry. You have no idea how much I wanted to come through for you. No, that's okay. It's probably safer if I don't find her. She's obviously gotten really good at hiding. I know she'll come for me. I just... I just have to be patient.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will tell her as soon as I get home, but that completely depends on you giving me a ride. (Bird panting) I think they're coming out. (Bird) Oh! (Banging) No, I think it's time to leave. Oh, my God! (Sighing) Oh, my God... sorry, sorry! (Whispering) Taylor and Max. Taylor is with Max. Yeah, I heard you the first time. Oh. Okay, well, can I come in? Uh, no, I'm talking to Regan. What? Uh, this conversation is between her and me. It's hard enough already, but I don't wanna make it a three-way. Conversation. ♪ Closing up shop ♪ 
♪ And locking doors ♪ 
♪ Turning up lost ♪ 
♪ In some unknown ♪ (Knocking) ♪ Don't make me say they've gone home ♪ 
♪ You sleep with the lights on when you're alone... ♪ Hey. Hi. Hey. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about what happened tonight. Who told you about that? I meant between you and me. Oh. God, I think seeing a dead body turned out to be the least traumatic part of my day. What else happened? Nothing. Well, stupid stuff... not life and death. Not what you have to deal with every day. Hey, you have to deal with a lot, none of which is stupid. Huge things that no one should have to deal with, especially not a 16-year-old. And I don't want to be one of those things. I wanna help you with those things. What are you saying? Carter, I'm gonna stop... looking for your... mom. For five minutes today you liked me. I know you did... and I want that, that's all. I just want more of that. Also, I'm really dying to know what possibly could've been more traumatic than seeing your first dead body. No, but we're not there yet, no. Um, let's take it five minutes at a time. Okay, that's what we're doing. We're doing that. (Exhaling) ♪ It feels like the end... ♪ 
♪ It feels like the end... Hey. Hey. (Dog barking) ♪ This is weird, you know that? Okay, you're in front of their house. Where else can I go, Max? My child is in there. She's my heart, walking around outside my body. Except she's not your child. Yes, she is. Don't you ever say that to me again. She's my child. Lori, I had this really long speech that I wanted to say to you. But, really, I think at this point, the only thing that I can do is walk back in there and tell them that you're here. You never actually know how much time you've got left with someone. Next Tuesday. After Carter falls hard for Crash. So you are in to me. Will she run away from her new life with him? Let's go. Crash. Or someone else? Carter. Oh my God.
