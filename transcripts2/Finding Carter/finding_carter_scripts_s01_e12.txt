 Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 Sit down and put your seat belt on. 
 Pretty safety-conscious for a fugitive. 
 (Cell phone alarm beeping) 
 Elizabeth put out an amber alert? 
 Oh, my height chart. 
 This is new. My mom wrote this. 
 Okay. What is it? 
 I don't know, but I'm gonna write it down. 
 My mom would have seen the amber alert. 
 We need to go leave a message for her with Max. 
 Just tell the cops you had a gun in your face. 
 Crash, what the hell are you doing? 
 The safety's on. See? 
 (Carter) What did you do? 
 Call 911. 
 What should... what should I do? 
 (Carter crying) 
 Currently, Max is non-responsive. 
 I'm gonna make it up to everyone, but especially to you. 
 If you care about Max so much, why don't you devote your time to finding your fugitive boyfriend and getting him arrested? 
 He's obviously a very unstable person. 
 He just wants to say good-bye. 
 You can't go. 
 Carter, if I can see that he's scum, how can you not? 
 This is love. This is that unbearable feeling that never goes away. 
 (Sirens blaring) 
 Let me see your hands! You're under arrest. 
 Crash! 
 Get her away from here. 
 I knew you were gonna follow me, 'cause you're my mom. 
 Please don't give up on me.

 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Why you looking at a zip code? 
 This is a zip code? 
 I thought zip codes only had five numbers. 
 Plus four, so your bills can get to you faster. 
 Why are you so interested in that? 
 Sure, you can use my computer. 
 Uh, sorry, I just need to, um... 
 You need to what? 
 This building has its own zip code? 
 Yeah, mail delivery became really efficient just when we stopped using it. 
 Wait a second. 
 (Elizabeth) Is that Montgomery Village, Maryland? 
 Yeah, why? Is that significant? 
 Yeah, your dad and I had our first apartment together there. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm, um, picking up photos for Carter Stevens. 
 Okay. 
 I think. 
 Uh, "Stevens" did you say? 
 Mm-Hmm. 
 Could it be under a different name or something? 
 Um, yeah, I guess. But I... 
 I don't know what it would be. 
 When was it dropped off? 
 Could it have been more than a month ago? 
 'Cause that's in a different drawer. 
 Oh, it was three months ago. Here we go. 
 Stevens, Carter. Prepaid. 
 Oh. 
 Thanks. 
 You're welcome.

 (Phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 (Woman) Elizabeth Wilson? 
 This is? 
 Claire Gregory. 
 I'm the youth counselor for the crisis response team. 
 We're with the mayor's office. Yeah, I work in law enforcement... I know the program. I'm calling about your daughter Carter. She's had some significant trauma in her live recently. Uh, yeah, to put it mildly. But, um, therapy? I'm sorry, but Carter is not a fan. That's pretty standard. Teenagers often resist going to therapy. When teenagers bury their issues, they manifest themselves in destructive behavior. We could just schedule a session. You can always cancel if Carter says no. Great, that's what we'll do. I have an opening tomorrow, 1:00. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. (Phone beeps off) Do you have a secret stash of cookies? You caught me. Can I have one? No. I can't have one cookie? They're not cookies. Money? You might as well just stop guessing, I'm not gonna tell you. p0rn? p0rn. Love letters. Carter, I'm not playing this game. It's love letters, isn't it? I knew it. They're not love letters. They're little notes. He used to write me little notes, and put 'em in obscure places where I could find them. And this morning, he put one underneath my coffee mug. And it just said... "Remember me?" And I thought, yeah... I remember. This is full of 'em. This is all before you were born. You mean... Kind of around this time? Carter, where did you get these pictures? Lori. Lori Stevens took these pictures? How's that possible? This is... Three years before we even knew her. Well, maybe she didn't take them. That's unlikely. But... (Sighs) These pictures are so creepy. Whoever took them was, like... stalking you. Carter, you're not going to like what I'm about to say. What? As you can see, I'm pregnant in these pictures. Three years later, Lori Stevens kidnaps you. And then we find you, and she leads you back to these pictures. We do have a stalker. It's Lori Stevens. And she wants us to know it. Yeah, you're right, I didn't want to hear that. All this time I thought I was investigating what I thought was just a kidnapping. Clearly it wasn't. What was it, then? It was like some kind of hit. We were targeted. No, that doesn't make sense. She didn't even know us. But why would she take these photos if you didn't even know her? I don't know. Stalkers are crazy people. I was raised by your stalker? Oh, my God. Do you remember when we first met her? She was doing hospice work on our street. Yeah, well, she said she was doing hospice work. She probably didn't even have a job. She moved into the neighborhood so she could be near us. I'm such an idiot. I invited her into our home and let her play with our three-year-old daughters. I made it easy for her. Did she even want me? What do you mean? Well, she was stalking you for years. What, all because she wanted a three-year-old child? It doesn't make any sense. None of this makes any sense. Carter... I told you a while back that I was gonna stop looking for Lori. No. I don't think you should stop looking for her. I think you should keep going. And I want to help you. Are you sure you want to do this? Just a couple of days ago, you thought of her as your mother. Yeah, but... because she's not. In fact, I don't even really know her real name. I don't even know if she wanted a kid, or if she just took me because she wanted to hurt you. Why would she want to hurt us? (Cell phones chime, vibrate) (Elizabeth) Oh, my God. Max is awake. They're moving him to a regular room. Thank God. Come on, let's go. Did you get my note? Yeah. It's nice. Come on. (Monitor beeping steadily) Max. Careful. (Carter) I'm sorry. (Crying) Hey. Everything hurts. I felt pretty good while I was hurting, though. I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me? Of course. God, you look horrible. Hey, sunshine. Yeah. I'm just happy to hear you talk. Mostly all I do is complain. Well, we'll take it. I'll take anything. I bet you've been getting pretty good at Zombie Lord, though. (Grant) Well, you're still all-time champ, but nobody will ever beat your score. Well, you got some time to, like, catch up, then, huh? (David) You just need a little rehab. You'll be back at it in no time. They keep saying a lot of rehab. Got my parents a little worried about that cash flow situation. I sound very depressing. I'm sorry about that. Max, you couldn't be depressing, even if you tried. Heard I made a mess at the mini-mart. Probably lost that job, huh? (Laughs) All right, I didn't mean you should try. Somebody else, you should say something. I feel like the guy bringing down the room here. Well, I am getting a "D" in Science. You are? What? Why would you bring that up? Because I'm trying to help Max out. He doesn't want to be the guy bringing down the room, so I figured, okay, I'll do it. You big palooka, get over here and give me a hug. A little noggin nuzzle, then go study. Rest time for studying. Hey. Hey. Come here. Okay, bear with me. This is a shot in the dark, but you know that place that you picked up the pictures? Well, across the street there's an apartment complex. I pulled all the tenants that lived there in July, 1997, and this is the list. Do you recognize any of those names? No. (Frustrated sigh) I'm just wondering, you know. Lori could have had those pictures developed anywhere, but she chose this place. Why? There must be a reason. I think she sent you there for more than just pictures. I do know that she was living in an apartment complex in Fredericksburg a couple of months ago, using the name Catherine Riley. What? How do you know that? You're not the only one who's been doing police work. Anyone seen my keys? You're looking very "Dead Poets Society" today. Okay, go ahead, just make it quick 'cause I don't have a lot of time for taunting this morning. Fine. I'm done. Oh. Whoa. Before you leave, could you just look at this list? Do you recognize any of those names? Mmm... no. Sorry. Bye. Bye. Call me. Or I'll call you? (Chuckles) Okay. (Sighs) (Door opens, closes) So, he left you any more notes? No, not that I know of. All right. Whoa, where are you going? I thought I'd go to school. It's been a while, and I'd really prefer not to have to redo this year. Yeah. But you know, what's... One more day's not gonna hurt. All right, I know I'm probably not supposed to ask, but, um, why can't I go to school? I have someone coming over here to talk to you. She's a therapist okay, come on, she... You know, she's not just your regular shrink. She specializes in teenagers with trauma. And you definitely have... Carter, you don't talk to anybody. You haven't even mentioned Crash. Yes, 'cause I heard no bail. Yeah. Obviously a flight risk. When's his arraignment? Thursday. You planning on going? I don't know. Carter... If you don't talk to me, you have to talk to someone. Okay. (Knock on door) (Tv off) Hi, you must... Mom? Hi, baby. Well, can I come in? Uh, yeah, yeah, come in. Anyone else here? Um, no, just me. Mom, this is weird. Don't I at least get a hug? So... How are they treating you? Mom, what are you doing here? I wanted to see you. I miss you. Um... Can I get a glass of water? My throat is suddenly just a little...  Yeah. Yeah, the, uh... the kitchen's just... So I guess you like having a family. Sister... twin sister! Yeah, and a brother. Oh, he's new. Yeah, he's great. And your dad. What's it like finally having a dad? Yeah, it's, um... It's had its ups and downs. I bet. Stupid of me to ever think I had a chance of getting you back. No, it wasn't. I thought we were happy. We were. I didn't want to let that go. Carter, I always, always planned to tell you the truth. But I kept putting it off and putting it off, and then... What did they tell you? Who? David and Elizabeth. I mean, they must have told you their version, which, obviously, was very convincing since David was the one to call and tell me you picked them over me. I didn't pick them over you. I couldn't pick. That was the point. You spent three months with them. How does that wipe out 13 years with me? It doesn't, but, mom, we shouldn't have had those. You don't mean that. It was all based on a lie. But that was the only lie. Then find me another family who lives with just one single lie. I know you can't say that about this one. No, I can't say that about this one. What did they tell you about me? (Sighs) They said you were their stalker. What? That is so typical. Where did they get that I'm their stalker? From the pictures you took. But they told you why, right... why I took those? No, mom, they don't know why you took them. I'm just a crazy person who randomly became obsessed with them. I mean, you didn't buy that. Did you? You did. Yeah, I think I should go. I'm gonna go. Mom! Then what, are they lying to me? Tell me something. Baby, why would you believe anything I say? I was gonna ask you to give this to David, but now I think you should keep it. They made it absolutely impossible for me to ever tell you the truth. But you deserve the truth. Get it from them. You were the very best part of my life. The very, very best. You still call me mom. So I'm your mom... not Elizabeth? I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. (Chuckles) Hey... this is your home. That's how it should be. But I will always think of you as my baby. And I love you. Love you more. Not possible. Yes, possible. 
 
 Cream of chicken! You love cream of chicken! I do not love cream of chicken. Yes, you do. You have, like, ten cans of it in your apartment. That's for donation. Will you put that back on? You also have pudding, apple sauce... I see all of that. Okay, we can start with pudding. Taylor, I'm really not hungry. Okay. I can go down to the cafeteria and get you a milkshake. Are you deaf? I just told you I'm not hungry. Okay. I'll get this out of your way. I'm sorry, I... I am mad at me. Max, why would you be mad at yourself? 'Cause I'm not getting it! I'm not getting that I'm shot, and that I'm here. And I keep waking up every morning thinking that I can go do whatever I normally want to do, and I can't! I can't go to work, and I'm a little scared about it! I wish I could help you, but I... I don't know how to help you. You can't, but your mom can. My mom? I have to see that tape from the mini-mart. No, you don't. Yes. That's the only way I'm gonna get it through my head of how I ended up here. Max, please, don't. Taylor, it's just not up for discussion. Just tell your mom. Okay. If that's what you want. (Door opens, closes) How was school? It was good. How 'bout you? I... I didn't go. Why not? I spent the day with Lori. Lori? Where did you see her? Here. Lori came to the house? She came inside the house. Are you okay? What... what happened? She gave me this picture of you. Where did she get this? She said she took it. She said she took it? So you didn't know her in 1997? Carter, how can you believe a woman who has lied to you every day for 13 years? How can I believe a man who wrote a book about my life, which he swore to me he wouldn't? I have two options here, and they both suck. Why don't you tell me who I'm supposed to believe? So you didn't bring it? No. I've seen the tape, and I can't show it to you. I don't want you to protect me. Well, I'm going to whether you want me to or not because you mean so much to Taylor. And Carter, Grant. And me. When you asked for my help, I gave it to you very willingly. Yes, you did. Okay, so just give me this one thing in return. That's all I'm asking for. No... I can't. (Sighs) You should probably get out of here then. I'll be right back. You take your time. Is he always like this? Like what? Angry, mean. No. No, he's, he's mostly depressed. I want to help him, but... I don't know how. Sweetie, Max, he needs doctors, specialists. His body and his mind are both suffering. Did you not hear what he said? His parents can't afford that stuff. Look, I'm all he has. Listen, that's too much responsibility, okay? You have a life that you need to get back to. Max is my life. What about school? Do you think I care about school? Yes, I do think you care about school. You've worked so hard for so long, you can't just throw it away now. That's my decision, not yours. And I'm gonna stay with Max for as long as he needs me. Taylor, let's just talk about this. We just did. (Sighs heavily) Well, hey. Hey, um, hope you don't mind, but I'm having one of your frozen dinners. I am so sorry. Let me... Let me make you something. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is fine, really. (Timer beeping) You know, I was gonna eat it... In my room. Okay, mmm, you go for that. Do you want to split it? No, it's all yours. Are you sure? I mean, it's your last one. Yes, Grant. Bon appétit. I'm so sorry, it's just... I just had a horrible day. All I want for dinner is a big bowl of chocolate ice cream. Yeah, I sorta ate that, too. (Phone ringing) (Groaning) Hello? Elizabeth? Hi, Claire Gregory from the crisis response team. (Elizabeth)  Yes, I'm so glad that you called. How did it go today? What did she say? Oh, I just got home. I didn't have a chance to ask her. How 'bout we get together and have a conversation about what happened today? Of course, but now you're scaring me. No need to he scared at all. It's just better to have these conversations in person. Do you have time tomorrow? Yeah, absolutely. For this? Late afternoon okay? 3:00, town square, by the fountain? Yeah, I know the place. Well, thank you so much. See you soon. (Phone beeps off) Hi. These are from my mom. She feels really bad about the fight you had yesterday. Well, tell her thank you. Or you could call her. Or you could tell her thank you, like I just asked you to. Okay. What is it? Nothing. You just rolled your eyes. I'm tired of you constantly saying "okay". Nothing's okay. Well... sure. I won't say it anymore. Ignore me, I'm in a really bad mood. (Knock on door) (Woman) Hi, is this a good time? Come in, Veronica. Max, this is Veronica. She works at the library at the hospital. She brought some books. So I heard you like Darwin. Could you give us a minute? Of course. I prefer you not invite random strangers in here. Sorry, he's not in a great mood. I'm in a perfectly fine mood. I just thought that you would like a book. (Door closes) What am I gonna do with a book? Well, you could read it. You mean you'd read it to me? What's wrong with that? I don't like you doing all these things for me. I don't mind. I mind. Is it all right if I mind? Yes, of course. Where are all your books? Why don't you have any books, Taylor? I never see you doing any homework. I don't have any. You don't have any homework? No. I'm taking some time off. From what? From school. I'm taking a leave of absence. It's not a big deal. Not because of me. Max, of course it's because of you. I want you to go. You're ordering me to go to school? No, I'm ordering you to go away. I want you to leave. I'll leave, but I'm gonna come back. Don't come back... I want you to get the hell out of here and stay gone. Okay. Sorry. Still working on those names? I have three females that fall within the age range that I'm looking for, but two of them I can't find records for. But at least I've narrowed down the search. I could help you with those after school if you want. Okay. That'll be fun. Oh, no, you know what? I can't. I, um... I have plans. You do? With who? Well, I'm meeting your therapist for coffee. You're meeting her? Yeah. She seems to have concerns about you. Is that what she told you? Yeah. So you're meeting her? Yeah. Do you have a problem with that? Yeah. Carter, are you sure you want to be here? No. But... I can't wonder what this was like for the rest of my life. You know what this means? Lori's going to prison, probably for 20 years. Yeah. She's my kidnapper. Yes, she is. And you're my mother. (Sniffles) I'm never gonna... get used to you saying that. Okay, um, so I'm gonna be meeting Lori here, and you're gonna be across the street at that cafe. And I want you to grab a seat. I don't want you to be visible, understand? It's gonna be quick. This place is surrounded by undercover cops. She has a history of getting away when you say that. I'm gonna get Lori, because this time, I have you on my side. And that means everything to me. Will you text me when she gets here? I will.  Stay in contact with me. Okay. I have my phone. All right. All right. (Knock on door) (Door opens) Hi. Hey. Can I come in? Yeah. ♪ You're doing great. Great's a bit of an overstatement. No, it's not, Max. That you're sitting here doing rehab exercises is... great. You're going to get better. I'm really sorry about earlier. I'm not gonna lie... it was rough, but... I know that you're just lashing out, and I know that it wasn't about me. It is about you. I just handled it really badly. Handled what? Can you hold my hand? I wish I could hold yours better. Max, I'm scared you're breaking up with me. I am. Please don't. Taylor, I can't stay here. I gotta go back home. It's only two hours away. Taylor.
