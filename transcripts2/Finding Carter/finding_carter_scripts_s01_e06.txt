 Are you okay? 
 There's a permanent marker in my makeup bag. 
 And, now that I think about it, I can't remember the last time I fully removed my eyeliner. 
 It does look good, though. 
 Hey, Bird called. 
 Are you guys having a problem? 
 What, other than the fact she's "slutty mcslutsky," the biggest slut in Slutsville? No, we're fine. 
 Good, because I said she could come over. 
 I guess I know the answer to, "are you mad at me?" 
 Thanks, sweetie, I can take it from here. 
 Is this about Crash? 
 What about Crash? 
 Uh, you giving me the silent treatment. 
 No, look, Bird, just because I don't talk to you for five minutes doesn't mean I'm giving you the silent treatment. 
 Or call or text or acknowledge my existence? 
 I'm going kinda crazy without you. 
 And it makes me sad that you're perfectly okay without me. 
 Okay, fine. Yes, it's about Crash. 
 You have no idea how much I hate to admit that. 
 You can't be jealous about me and Crash. 
 We're just friends. 
 I know, but tell that to my head. 
 I've got this 3D Imax movie of the two of you together playing over and over, and I can't stop thinking about it. 
 Babe, I'm sorry, okay? 
 I really believed you when you said you weren't into him, because that's what you told everyone all the time. 
 I was just trying to convince myself, which I didn't. 
 Oh! 
 I hate not being in control of my feelings. 
 I hear you. 
 See, okay, that's the other thing. 
 I can't be into the same guy you're into... that's weird. 
 Don't even worry about it, okay? 
 We're all the same to Crash, just one on a potential list of girls to bang. 
 Well, I have no intention of being that. 
 None of us do, and yet... 
 All right, you know what? I have to resolve this. 
 I'm sick of running away from it. 
 Do you know where he lives? 
 I think it's best you just call him. 
 Bird, you're telling someone you like them for the first time, but you really don't wanna tell them, and you also really don't wanna even like them in the first place, but you're also wondering if they like you, too. 
 I'm not having that conversation over the phone. 
 I just really think he wouldn't want you to go to his home. 
 Why? 
 Just trust me, okay? 
 He wouldn't. 
 Okay, well, you know what? 
 That's not good enough for me. 
 I told you. 
 So, what? Who cares? 
 I'm guessing he will. 
 (Car alarm chirps) 
 (Knocking) 
 (Woman) What? 
 Uh, hi. I'm looking for Crash. 
 Who? 
 Oh, hi. 
 My name's Carter. I'm a friend of his. 
 Is he here? 
 Who? 
 Crash. 
 Crash ain't here. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, well, would you mind telling him I stopped by? 
 (Scoffs) Get out! 
 (Carter) But wait. 
 Go on. 
 Let's go. 
 Please don't tell him I was here.

 (Crowd cheering) 
 You won! 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 Congratulations... you have a perfect record this season. 
 We've only had two meets. 
 Which is perfect. 
 How'd you guys do in the relay? 
 We got massacred, as per usual. 
 It'd help if everyone didn't do it just for college applications. 
 (Laughs) 
 I wanted to tell you, the other night... 
 That was a lot of fun. 
 I had a really good time. 
 I'm serious. I was surprised. 
 I think you actually melted my brain. 
 Yeah, okay, can we not talk about it? 
 Of course, we don't have to talk about it. 
 So, I hear there's a good chance you could become team captain. 
 That's very impressive for a junior. 
 Hey, what're you doing tonight? 
 I have a science poster to do, and then they just slammed us with a bunch of English reading. 
 Well, I know that I'm not as exciting as either of those, but I was hoping that we could do something. 
 You and me? 
 Like a date? 
 As in a date, yes. 
 But you want me to bring Carter? 
 No, I don't. 
 But you like Carter. 
 She wouldn't go out with me because she told me that you liked me, which I never knew. 
 I'd... I'd always thought of you as more of a... 
 No, don't say it. 
 Come on, you've said it enough. 
 And... and I was very wrong about that. 
 Is there anything that I can do to get you to like me again? 
 I don't know. 
 Just a shot, that's all I'm asking for. 
 This is crazy. 
 I mean you standing here, saying these things to me? 
 Is that a yes? 
 I can pick you up at 8:00. It'll be fun. 
 Come on. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. That's mine. 
 Hi. 
 Thanks. 
 You know what? Keep the change. 
 I'm gonna need that hat. 
 (Woman) What? 
 (Clears throat) Uh, Spotina's Pizza. 
 You need to pay. 
 How much? 
 Hi. 
 Cool hat. 
 Come talk to me? 
 I'd rather not. 
 Please? 
 Well, you called this meeting. 
 Is it to ask me for another favor? 
 Maybe you wanna reprimand me again for stealing your car. 
 Did you travel all this way to make sure that I'd fully understand that you are absolutely not into me? 
 ♪ 
 So you are into me. 
 Well, that happened. 
 Help. 
 So, now what? 
 I don't know. 
 Take me somewhere. 
 Like, your favorite place. 
 Well, that would be right here, right now. 
 Well, I appreciate the extraneous flirting, but I was serious. 
 So was I. 
 Uh... 
 My life hasn't been exactly scenic. 
 I've spent most of it in some pretty nasty detention centers. 
 Okay, well, let's go to one. 
 I wanna see one. 
 No. 
 I mean, I'd like to take you by and show you off. 
 I... I spent a lot of time with people who didn't see anything in me. 
 They'd be pretty shocked if I showed up with someone like you. 
 I'm pretty shocked myself, actually. 
 What, because you're such a bad person? 
 That's the abridged version, but yeah. 
 What if I don't think you are? 
 Then you'd be wrong. 
 Really? 
 Prove it. 
 Okay. 
 Where are we going? 
 Instead of taking you to my favorite place, I'm gonna take you to my least favorite place. 
 Okay. 
 Help yourself to anything you would like. 
 Not the beer or the wine. 
 And I don't think I can give away any free motor-oil yet, but, uh... 
 Perhaps a nice Skaddens? 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Loaded with peanuts for your journey. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 So what else brings you to the Quick-n-Easy? 
 Well, I had a question... 
 Yeah? 
 Actually, yeah. 
 Um, you know Gabe, right? 
 Yeah, I know Gabe. 
 Yeah, well, he... He asked me out on a date. 
 Oh. 
 But I... I was wondering if you think I should go, or if maybe you... 
 No, I definitely think that you should go. 
 Um... 
 'Cause Gabe's a really great catch. 
 You know, he's... he's like a jock, and he's really popular. 
 That's like a score. 
 He asked you out? 
 Yeah. 
 You don't have any other contradictory reactions? 
 Uh-uh, no. I don't think so. 
 All pretty "dictory." 
 Okay, well... 
 Thank you for your advice. 
 Mm-Hmm. 
 And the Skaddens. 
 Yeah, you need anything else? 
 No. No. 
 All right, well, see you.

 What is this place? 
 Can't you tell? 
 This is my after-school hangout, my babysitter, my community center. 
 It's my outward bound for wayward kids. 
 When I was 13, I'd come here and get high, shoot off bottle rockets. 
 We put a zip-line in. 
 It's Disneyland, right? 
 So... 
 I had a brother. 
 Okay. 
 Ben. 
 He was younger. He was an idiot. 
 When we were little, my mom dropped us off at my aunt Di's house. 
 Says she'll be back later to pick us up, but later never happened. 
 So one afternoon I'm supposed to watch Ben. 
 I'm too cool, though, to sit around and play battleship with a ten-year-old. 
 So I bring him here. 
 He hates it, says it's ugly and dirty, and, "why do I have to play here?" 
 "What's wrong with battleship? 
 Why can't we just go home?" 
 So I'm like, "Ben, just go sit in the truck." 
 Me and my friends were sitting over there drinking. 
 All of a sudden the truck's in flames. 
 Oh, my God. 
 The police tried to blame me and my friends, but he was playing with the ignition, and there was some weird defect with the truck. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Crash? 
 That's not a name, that's an insurance claim. 
 You said that Carter's friends with this guy? 
 No, not friends. 
 He's more something she can use to torment me. 
 Wow. Well, he's not gonna be a problem after Monday. 
 Second charge of possession with intent to distribute. 
 This is gonna be a slam dunk. 
 He'll get at least a couple years in Deerfield. 
 Well, this is some career I got, pursuing the criminals in my daughter's life. 
 I should transfer to something less stressful, like the bomb squad. 
 So are we still on for Monday night? 
 What's Monday night? 
 You better be joking. 
 No, what's Monday night? 
 You know, I should just use my head as a brick, because I'm that stupid. 
 I pay for a hotel room, order champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries... 
 It's our anniversary. 
 You asked me what I wanted, and I said just to wake up with you. 
 It's not gonna happen, is it? 
 No, it's gonna happen. 
 How? 
 Because you obviously haven't told David that you're gonna be away for the night. 
 I can still tell him. 
 He's not gonna care. 
 He spends 90 percent of his life in his office, Kyle. 
 I'll work on it.

 Oh, it's for you. 
 Okay. Good to see you, too. 
 Hi. Wow... 
 Hey. Yeah, we should just go. 
 I... I forgot my sweater. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 You look nice. 
 Hey, man, that's my line. Making me look bad.

 Oh, finally you're here. 
 Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 Have fun. 
 Yeah, we intend to. 
 You know, I'm really starting to like that guy. 
 Me, too. 
 (Knocking) 
 Come in. 
 Hey, sorry to bother you. 
 I just had the most unexpected conversation with my mom. 
 Oh? 
 Apparently, she bought a overnight spa getaway at a silent auction. 
 She was planning on bringing her friend Lois, but then Lois suddenly needs a hip transplant. 
 Is anyone in this story under the age of 70? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Well, she wants me to go with her. 
 The room has a hot tub, uh, facials, and something called a chromatic color wrap. 
 And 24 hours of nonstop criticism. 
 After four decades, I think I can handle it. 
 It is Monday night. 
 It's okay if I go, right? 
 Sure. 
 You've been working so hard you deserve a break. 
 Well, I'd rather go with you. 
 Well... 
 It wouldn't be the same. 
 I'll let you get back to work. 
 Oh... sorry. 
 You seem pretty happy. 
 Yeah, I guess I am. 
 I don't suppose I'm gonna get any more information on that. 
 Nope. 
 Well, you know what, as long as you're happy. 
 If parents had a flag, that would be our motto. 
 We just want our kids happy. 
 Is there enough in there for me? 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 Have some. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 You know, there's not enough, uh, junk food in this house. 
 We've got five people. 
 We need more than just one pint of ice cream. 
 We've got gluten-free cookies. 
 Oh, no. Have you tried those? 
 Those things are terrible. 
 Wait, didn't you buy them? 
 Yes. 
 I wanted a cookie that didn't make me wanna eat cookies. 
 But I don't think that feeling ever goes away. 
 Even babies, you know, they can only drink milk. 
 I think they're thinking, "you know what this milk could really use? 
 A cookie." 
 Oh. 
 I think you just made a joke. 
 I am not an animal, I am a human being. 
 I know it's... it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger gone bad. 
 You're too young. 
 You don't know that reference. 
 Yeah, I do. It's "The Elephant Man." 
 Yeah, my mom used... 
 She used to be really into movies. 
 It was kind of her thing. 
 Every time I'd get sick or anything, she'd, like, sit with me in bed, and we'd watch movie after movie. 
 Kind of like a mini film- festival, but with the flu. 
 Anyway, sorry. 
 I'm sure you don't wanna hear about any of that. 
 I was actually thinking how grateful I am to her. 
 She made you very happy, gave you a great life. 
 That's a really amazing thing for you to say. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, you have the rest. 
 I have a court case Monday that I have to prepare for. 
 Good luck, I hope you win. 
 Thanks, me, too. 
 I'll finally get that Crash off the street. 
 He's so worthless. 
 Don't talk about him like that. 
 That's horrible. 
 I thought you were done with him. 
 Well, I'm not. 
 Since when? 
 Since today, actually. 
 Okay, well, at least it's not serious. 
 It is serious. 
 You don't know what kind of life he's led. 
 I'm sure it's been tough, and maybe it's to blame for what he's become. 
 Maybe? 
 But it doesn't matter anymore, because now it's who he is. 
 How can you even say that? 
 That boy has had no one to believe in him... 
 Ever. 
 Now he does. 
 I don't think the judge that's going to see him on Monday is gonna share your optimism. 
 Why? What's gonna happen? 
 This is his second arrest... A fairly sizable bust... 
 And from what I can tell, his only defense is "I just won't do it again." 
 No judge is going to buy that with his juvie record. 
 Carter, he's going to prison. 
 For... for how long? 
 At least three years. 
 Is that definite? 
 No, it... It could be five, it could be ten. 
 Carter... 
 Baby, believe me, he knows this. 
 And the fact that he didn't tell you he's about to go to prison is all the information you need to know about this boy. 
 Yes, it does. 
 It tells me he's not gonna be there on Monday. 
 
 
 
 When were you gonna tell me you were gonna run away? 
 Today was perfect. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I would've been the last perfect day you ever would've had with me. 
 I couldn't end today telling you I was about to go to prison. 
 Well... 
 Today isn't over yet.

 Marcy Katz' class. 
 Do you remember she told us she was a lesbian? 
 She came out to a room of five-year-olds. 
 You probably forgot my class photo. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Your bangs were... 
 I don't need to see it or relive it, thanks. 
 And they lined up our photos, and it was like boy, girl, girl, boy, monster.

 I wanna go to Utah and sell hot tubs to rich skiers. 
 That's your lifelong dream? 
 No, I just made it up. 
 Is that not... 
 No? 
 Carter, let's go. 
 Let's do it. We can do this. 
 Crash. 
 No, I mean it. 
 All right, I don't wanna wait three years to start my life with you. 
 It's already started. 
 And it's not gonna end if you have to go to prison for a while. 
 No, you think it won't, but it will. 
 Okay. 
 Well, then, have faith in me. 
 I have faith in you. 
 What? 
 Crash, what's wrong? 
 Sit down. 
 Crash. 
 Look, I don't want three years of... of you seeing me in a... a green jumpsuit in some dirty room being told that you can't touch me, okay? 
 I'd rather you see me like this, even if it's for the last time. 
 Crash. 
 Bye, Carter. 
 Crash, where are you going? 
 Please don't go. 
 Crash! 
 Hello? 
 (Sighs) 
 (Sighs) No. 
 Have you heard from him? 
 All right. 
 Will you tell me if you do? 
 Thanks. 
 Bye. 
 When are they going to invent a phone that rings when you want it to? 
 If it was up to me, today. 
 Wait, who are you waiting to hear from? 
 Max. 
 Just call him. 
 No. 
 Why? 
 I wanna know if he likes me, and I'll only know if he calls me. 
 Or, you know, you could just ask him. 
 Yeah, 'cause I'm such an emotional daredevil. 
 That's what I did with Crash. 
 That's you. 
 It's not me. 
 Taylor, are you really willing to risk losing someone who you really like just because you're too scared to ask them if they like you? 
 Come on, you like Max, right? 
 Yeah, a lot. 
 Okay, well, why take the risk? 
 Look, you know what, if there's anything I've learned in the last few months, it's that you never actually know how much time you've got left with someone. 
 You know there's all this stuff that I wish I had said to my mom. 
 And now there's all this stuff I'm never gonna get to say to Crash. 
 What won't you get to say to Crash? 
 Everything. 
 I don't even know what I'm not gonna get to say to him. 
 That's... 
 That's the whole point. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This is my stuff. 
 Max is not gonna disappear on you. 
 Is that what Crash is doing? 
 Well, I hope not, but that's what it's starting to look like. 
 You have to go get him. 
 How? I have absolutely no idea where he is. 
 You have to. 
 You're my role model. 
 Fine. 
 So, you'll see Max? 
 You'll tell him you like him? 
 Yes. 
 Come here. 
 It's gonna be great, I promise. 
 Don't worry. 
 Thanks. 
 (Sighs) Hi, it's me. 
 Look, Crash, this is the last message I'm gonna leave you. 
 You're gonna spend your whole life running away from your problems... 
 Running away from the person that you're terrified of becoming. 
 But that's not life. 
 Okay? That's... 
 That's just running from it. 
 And I know I've never been in your position, or even close, but, Crash, I have spent the last few months running away from stuff, and I can tell you it is exhausting. 
 Please don't let the decisions you make now ruin the rest of your life. 
 Please come home. 
 Please. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 (Elevator dings) Bird! Anything? I'm sorry, nobody's seen him. (Sighs) Carter, I think you need to accept that he's not gonna show up. I really think that he might this time. That would mean taking responsibility and recognizing that he's made mistakes. And those are two things Crash has never done. No, but I can't just accept that. Carter, I know he cares about you, but he's not gonna go to jail just to prove that he's a good guy. It's time. Is he here? No, he's not. (Metal detector beeping) Yes, he is. Hey! You came. Yeah, I did. Did you doubt me? No. That's why I'm here. Hey. (Bird laughing) Hey. I'm stunned. Yeah, me, too. Detective Wilson, should we go in? No. Could you please stand over there? Why? Let's just let them talk, okay? I talked to your court-appointed counsel and the district attorney, and they agreed to three years probation and 100 hours community service. What? It's done. Your court case is done. Can I hug you? No! What? What happened? I'm not going to prison. What? Oh, my God. Wait, he's... he's not? Not today. Congratulations! Uh, detective Wilson, thank you. I... I know you did this. I... Carter, there's some more things that I need to discuss with Crash, okay? Please? It's cool. (Girls tittering) You have zero chances left. Zero. So, if you even so much as light up a joint, you're gonna be behind bars for three years, and then after that, the next step is spending the rest of your life in a cage. I want you to know that I get it, all right? You did this because you love your daughter more than you hate me, but you won't be sorry. I'm going to do everything in my power to... To prove to you that I'm worthy of your daughter. So, thank you for this chance to show you that... You're wrong about me. (Police radio chatter) Oh, hey. Hey. So, what did you think?

But it's only good for one call. My shift's almost up. I'm not sure the next guy's gonna be up for hosting "America's most wanted." You used to be so cool. So did you. (Scoffs) Come here. Oh... I am so happy right now. Love you. I love you, too. I think I already forgot how it goes. Oh, sorry. I just... it's been so long since we said... Um, love you. Love you more. Not possible. Yes possible. I'm gonna miss calling you "Carter." Next time on "Finding Carter"... Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday! The last time you two celebrated a birthday together you were three years old. I want you to stay. I know you have to do what you have to do. I can't stay here and be with my mom at the same time, okay? I have to choose. You should not go. Are you cheating on David? I don't know what I want.
