 Oops. 
 I was not supposed to do that. 
 You think this is cute? 
 This isn't cute, you're high. 
 You're making a fool of yourself. 
 I liked you better when I thought you were dead. 
 Very funny. 
 She's having a seizure. 
 Hey, Evan, call 9-1-1. 
 Carter, I'm so sorry.

 Carter! 
 It's time to go! 
 Carter! 
 She wants to make me yell. 
 I'm just giving her exactly what she wants. 
 Not what I want. If that still matters for anything around here. 
 You know what? 
 Bring that up at family therapy tonight. 
 The last thing I wanna do is spend another hour of my life talking about Carter. 
 That's the whole point of family therapy. 
 Finding Carter has made our lives very complicated. 
 This has been a tough month. 
 I'm happy she's here. 
 We're all happy she's here. 
 I'd be happier if she were here. 
 I am. 
 Come on, we don't wanna be late. 
 Carter, you can't go to school in your pajamas. 
 Why not? 
 What difference does it make? 
 Fine. 
 You take them. 
 Uh, no, I can't, I've got that meeting in the city today. 
 It's the editor of "Vanity Fair." 
 They're looking for someone to do a true crime column. 
 One like Dominick Dunne. 
 So you never were gonna wear your pajamas to school. 
 Nope. 
 You did that just to annoy mom? 
 No, I did that to distract her. 
 This is what I'm doing to annoy her. 
 Do you guys want a ride? 
 Do not use her as a role model, Grant. 
 Yeah, not when you've got so many other great options.

 (School bell ringing) 
 As you may know, the school is reevaluating its zero tolerance program. 
 So, for the time being, we are reinstating our point system. 
 Boo. 
 Each one of you will receive this booklet. 
 It's the list of infractions and the points you will receive as a result of those infractions. 
 For example, miss Gilroy, eating in class, one point. 
 Please put away that yogurt. 
 When you have accumulated enough points, you will begin to lose privileges. 
 (Hyperventilating) 
 For example, five points, no pep rally. 
 Ten points earns you cafeteria cleanup. 
 15 points gives you five Saturday detention. 
 15 points... 
 Mr. Sharkey. 
 Oh, dear Lord. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I think she's having a panic attack. 
 Yogurt. 
 Does she want my yogurt? She can have my yogurt? 
 It's my mom. 
 The last time she saw her mom, the kidnapper mom, was in a yogurt shop. 
 She almost got arrested by my dad. 
 Take her to the office, have her call her parents. 
 I'll call your mom. 
 Don't bother. 
 Wait, so you're not... 
 And please stop calling Elizabeth my mom. 
 She is... she is not my mom. 
 So you faked that whole thing. 
 Well, not the part where I had to listen to you brag about how your dad almost arrested the "kidnapper" mom. 
 Please don't refer to her as that, she is just my mom. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It gets confusing sometimes. 
 Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. 
 Well, thanks for getting me out of there. 
 So Bam, we just got a whole day off school. 
 What do you wanna do? 
 Gabe, I'm not spending the day with you. 
 Come on, I've got my car. 
 We can go into the city. 
 I'll take you to see the stairs from "The Exorcist." 
 Gabe, I can't even say your name without Taylor going blech and walking out the room. 
 If she finds out I spent the entire day with you, she'll kill me. How would she find out? 
 She'll never find out. 
 Taylor. 
 Well, I always wondered what it would be like to have a sister. 
 Now I know. 
 Who is that guy? I see him everywhere. 
 Ofe, you never met Ofe? 
 Ofe? 
 Stands for "One Freaking Eyebrow." 
 What's his real name? 
 Nobody remembers. 
 I don't even know if he remembers. 
 Okay, so what you wanna do is you wanna... 
 You wanna pick a date, okay, and then the buy-in's gonna be ten dollars. 
 Winner takes home three grand. 
 What if a year goes by, and they don't catch her. 
 Then we start a new pool, and the pot doubles. 
 Excuse me. 
 Ow, man! 
 Sorry, sorry. 
 That's my mom. 
 I just lost a customer, not your fault. 
 I do blame you, however, Gabe. 
 I didn't know. Oh, you knew. 
 We decided not to tell him. 
 Right, that is what we decided. 
 Tell me what? 
 I'm Ofe, by the way. 
 I'm Bird, we kind of met at that party. 
 Remember, she's the one that did that thing with the shot glass. 
 Shot glass, that was sweet. 
 I love that, I could never... I'm afraid of fire. 
 Why have you got a photo of my mom in your briefcase? 
 This is my office. 
 I make book, I take bets, sporting events mostly. 
 Anything from high school matchups to pro ball, pretty much full service. 
 I do straight, parlay, teasers, sides. 
 I calculate my own spreads. 
 If I may indulge in a little humblebrag, and from time to time, I come up with a fun novelty pool. 
 So you're taking bets on the date my mom gets arrested. 
 If it makes you feel any better, most people are giving her at least six months. 
 You're an ass. 
 I know, I'm sorry. 
 I feel really bad. 
 Maybe don't do the pool. 
 I don't feel that bad. 
 You know what, it doesn't matter. 
 It doesn't matter, she promised me she'd be back. 
 I shouldn't even be here. 
 Where are you going? 
 Somewhere I don't have to think about how much my life sucks now. 
 If there even is such a place. 
 ♪ 
 There is. 
 Come on. 
 Wow, this is all yours? 
 A 16th birthday present from my parents. 
 If there had been a card, it would've said, "we love you, now go away." 
 This was supposed to be an art studio. 
 Now it's like the chocolate factory from Willy Wonka, only with booze and pot instead of everlasting gobstoppers. 
 I have everlasting gobstoppers. 
 So you're an artist. 
 (Gabe) A great artist. 
 She did the Alice in wonderland mural in the cafeteria. 
 Really? That's impressive. 
 Thanks. 
 Face of the mad hatter, that's me. 
 No, it's Johnny Depp. 
 God, would it kill you to one time say it's me? 
 ♪ Why are you living ♪ 
♪ What are you missing ♪ 
 Hey, can I borrow this? 
 I've got this family therapy thing tonight, and I think it can be very useful. 
 Oh, family therapy, huh? 
 We tried that once, me and my parents. 
 Really, did it work? 
 Oh, yeah, we're closer than ever. 
 São Paulo is closer than Dubai, right? 
 Ah, poor little rich girl. 
 Smart, judgmental cop's kid. 
 Help yourself. 
 This place is bigger than the one I used to live in with my mom. 
 Sorry about that stupid pool, Carter. 
 I'm sorry you haven't heard from her. 
 No chance she'll come back to the yogurt store? 
 No, I doubt it. 
 Anyway, they fired me. 
 Apparently, people don't like to be under police surveillance while they eat yogurt. 
 That's fine, though, I know she'll get in touch. 
 I just don't know how the FBI's got everything but a camera up my ass. 
 Screw the FBI. 
 We could, actually. 
 It wouldn't even be that hard. 
 What do you mean? 
 So they're stalking your phone, right? 
 In case your mom sends you a message. 
 So we get your mom... 
 I mean, us pretending to be your mom to text you. 
 With burner phones. 
 Cheapo phones with prepaid minutes. 
 You can get 'em pretty much anywhere. 
 Including right here. 
 It's a side business, I also sell glow sticks. 
 I do very well at parties. 
 Okay, so what should the message be? 
 Something a mother would say to a daughter. 
 I know what it would say. 
 "Love you more." 
 Love you more. 
 (Beeping sending) 
 (Beeping receiving) 
 (Gabe) Phase one complete. 
 Elizabeth, I believe there was something you wanted to say to Carter. 
 I was really angry today when I found out that you went through my bag and had taken my car keys. 
 I... 
 Reacted immaturely. 
 I went into your room, and I looked through your closet, and I found something. 
 I found the backpack. 
 The one that's packed like you're ready to run away. 
 I can't do that again. 
 I can't come home one day and find out that you're gone. 
 Please, give me a chance. 
 How was that, Elizabeth? 
 Not so bad. 
 I've always been able to talk to Carter when she wasn't there. 
 (David) If we want her to come to therapy, we can't get mad at her for not coming to therapy. 
 I wasn't going to. 
 Morning, sunshine. 
 Did you borrow my car or just steal it? 
 I'm only asking because it isn't here. 
 Carter, get rid of that. 
 Your 12-year-old brother is in the room. 
 Oh, come on, has he never been to a sporting event? 
 Not many. 
 It's a joke, it's a toy. 
 No, you know very well what it is, it's an obscenity. 
 From, like, the 1970s, geez. 
 Glad I didn't bring it to family therapy last night. 
 No, instead, you just decided not to show up. 
 Kids, you're taking the bus this morning. 
 The bus? 
 I was gonna take them. I hate the bus. 
 No, we have to deal with this. 
 This... I'm a this now. 
 The bus is starting to look pretty good. 
 Yeah. 
 You can borrow my headphones. 
 I have headphones. 
 Not like these. 
 Thanks. 
 Look, I'm sorry, I was with friends, and I got a little drunk, and I thought I probably shouldn't drive. 
 Especially since it was your car. 
 (Door closing) 
 So I got Gabe to give me a ride. 
 See, she was being responsible. 
 David... 
 She stole my car keys out of my purse. 
 She got drunk, she skipped a therapy session that we desperately need, and now this is how she talks to me? 
 How does any of this qualify as being responsible? 
 You're right, it doesn't. 
 I just want this thing out of my house. 
 That seems kind of fair. 
 Okay. 
 (Horn honking) 
 That's Gabe, I asked him to give me a ride. 
 It's leaving the house, as you requested. 
 (Door opening) 
 (Door closing) 
 She put it on my car, didn't she? 
 No. 
 No? 
 Oh, I'm surprised. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Maybe she actually feels bad about the whole thing. 
 How you doing? 
 Fine. 
 Really? 'Cause you look stressed. 
 Kyle, you don't have to keep checking up on me. 
 Okay, you can tell me that we're not seeing each other, but you can't tell me to stop caring about you. 
 It hasn't been easy. 
 Okay, well, maybe this will help. 
 Looks like Lori's been in touch with Carter. 
 She's been getting text messages from burner phones. 
 Any idea where she is? We can't trace 'em, but we can tell they're local. 
 They're local? 
 Yeah. 
 Keep an eye on Carter. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Is it okay if I tape our interview? 
 Yeah. 
 Sure, ask me... okay. 
 So you're, uh, Carter's real mother. 
 Elizabeth, right? 
 Detective Wilson. 
 Right. 
 I'm sorry, detective Wilson. 
 Is this, uh, are we starting? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Before we start, I just wanna say... 
 I really like Lori, Carter's other mom. 
 She is not Carter's other mom. 
 She is Carter's kidnapper. 
 Yes, I just... I thought you should know, I have that thing where I'm not objective. 
 I see what Carter means about you. 
 Excuse me. 
 She says you never laugh, like, she's never heard what you sound like when you're laughing. 
 Not that this is funny, this is not funny... 
 At all. 
 Like a funny situation, it's not. 
 But she says you're, like, one of those people who brag, "I never cry." 
 Only with you, it's... 
 "I never laugh." 
 (Camera beeps) 
 Oh, man... 
 What else does Carter say about me? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's for dinner? I'm starving. 
 Tilapia with ginger and garlic. 
 Cool, as long as it's not fish. 
 It's fish. 
 Taylor, we have our entire lives to eat fish and steamed veggies. 
 We have this tiny, tiny window where we can eat onion rings and milkshakes and... 
 Oh, my God, I so want onion rings and a milkshake right now. 
 (Door closing) Hey. 
 What smells so good? 
 Fish. 
 Oh, see? 
 Fish can never be the answer to, "mmm, what smells so good?" 
 Well, I hope we have enough for one more because I brought home a guest for dinner. 
 Well, there's plenty because I'm going out to eat. 
 Max, what are you doing here? 
 Uh, Max, you should meet the rest of the family. 
 This is Taylor, uh, Carter's twin sister. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 And Grant... Grant?! 
 This is Grant, Carter's brother. 
 Dude. 
 What's up? 
 David! 
 Well, he's probably working, that's my husband, he's a writer. 
 I invited Max to stay for a couple of days. 
 You did? 
 Yes, I thought you'd enjoy it. 
 You cleared it with your folks, right? 
 Yeah, I don't think they believe me, though. 
 Cops don't usually bring me home. 
 To their home... They don't bring me to their home. 
 I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me. 
 No, I wouldn't call that mad. 
 Okay, I really would. 
 So what, then, she just invited you here? 
 Yeah, you know, like, invitation, subpoena. 
 What's going on? 
 The usual. 
 Okay, now I get it. 
 No, you don't, let me explain. 
 Yes. 
 You didn't bring him here for me. 
 You brought him here for you. 
 You see, it's not enough that you're already listening into all of my phone calls and checking my emails. 
 Now you have to plant my friends in my home to spy on me. 
 Come on, we're leaving. 
 Nice meeting you all, I'm Max. 
 David. 
 You know what? 
 Now would be the perfect opportunity to put a bug in my room.

 (Gabe) So how long you gonna be here? 
 Uh, not sure. 
 Not like I brought a lot of clean clothes. 
 But I did bring a lot of dirty ones. 
 Man, I got this fat pile of dirty dinghies in the back seat of my car, it's stinking. 
 Can you recommend a good laundromat? 
 Max, you can do your wash at our place. 
 Bonus. 
 What about school and... You go to school, don't you? 
 Uh, oh, yeah, um... 
 There's been some confusion about my grade, which grade I'm in, so I kind of been home schooling... 
 Without the schooling. 
 Oh. 
 Man, I already got interrogated today by her mother. 
 His dad's also a cop. 
 Yeah, in fact, his dad is the guy who followed me that day I came to visit you. 
 Nobody will be following Carter after my little FBI sting. 
 We're sending Carter texts from burner phones to make it look like they're coming from her mom. 
 Oh. 
 Uh-huh, okay. 
 How's that going? 
 It's phase two, now we find out. 
 I need a new phone. 
 Last one, then you gotta start paying, I'm not Amazon. 
 I get it, I get it. 
 You all free tomorrow after school? 
 Yup. 
 Yup. 
 Always. 
 Good. 
 What are you writing? 
 Don't worry, I got this, I know how cops work. 
 They like to solve things, figure stuff out. 
 Like Batman and the riddler. 
 Yeah, but you can't give 'em anything that hard. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Captain? 
 Detective Wilson, this is Grady Smith from the FBI felony kidnapping unit. 
 Kidnapping unit, what's happening? 
 Carter's been getting a series of texts from untraceable numbers. 
 We think it could be coming from her kidnapper. 
 Now one by one, they don't make any sense. 
 Then... 
 I line 'em up. 
 First word of every sentence. 
 Mm-Hmm, food court mall, 4:00 P.M. today. 
 It's a pretty basic code, we're obviously not dealing with a criminal mastermind here. 
 All sent within the last 24 hours. 
 We got undercovers in place already. 
 We've already got eyes on everyone going in or out. 
 Captain, I have to be there. 
 Detective, we need you to keep your daughter in your sight. 
 I can get my husband to pick her up... 
 I'm giving that job to you. 
 I'll be there. 
 And I'll be there. 
 We've got this covered, I assure you. 
 We will catch this woman. 
 You just take care of your daughter. 
 Kyle, help me, please, I have to be there. 
 You heard what the captain said. 
 Hey, I'm not gonna let you lose Carter again. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Where's Carter? 
 You don't actually think she's been coming to school, do you? 
 What do you mean? 
 She's got everyone thinking she's got post traumatic stress disorder, and they send her home.

 Carter. 
 No, no. 
 Please, God, no. 
 What's going on? 
 What's going on?! 
 What's going on? 
 I don't know. 
 We have apples? 
 Yeah, I couldn't find any peanut butter, though. 
 She keeps it in the fridge. 
 That's weird. 
 Yeah. 
 I know, I'm sorry, captain, I'm sorry, but she's not at school, and she's not at home, and her escape backpack is missing. 
 All right, you're here. 
 We've got every possible access covered. 
 You two eyeball this crowd. 
 On three. 
 She's not here. 
 I don't know, Kyle. 
 Something doesn't seem right. 
 ♪ (Rock and roll) 
 (All laughing) 
 Looks like this message was meant for you. 
 Good you were here to get it. 
 (Carter) Max. 
 Max, come here, this is the best thing ever. 
 Everything to you is the best thing ever. 
 What is it? 
 Okay, so Elizabeth thinks I'm meeting my mom in this food court, and she's looking around. 
 And she's looking around and... 
 (Laughing) 
 Am I right, isn't that the best thing you've ever seen? Wait, wait, wait, this is my favorite part, it's my favorite part, look at her face, look at her face, look at her face... (laughing) 
 She looks... she looks so sad. 
 Oh, my God, Max, don't tell me you feel sorry for her. A little, look at her. 
 Max... 
 This woman, the whole entire reason you're even here is because she is obsessed with the idea of putting my mom in jail. 
 She got me back, okay, I am here. 
 Why don't you make that your focus, or how about just being happy with that and leaving my mom alone? 
 I love my mom, okay? 
 More than anyone or anything in the whole entire world. 
 And I live with someone who would kill her if she could. 
 Which she can't, but you know what she can do? 
 She can put her in jail for 20 years. 
 And that is what Elizabeth lives for. 
 That is why she was in the food court in the first place. 
 She knows how much it would hurt me, and she couldn't care less. 
 Hey, look, I'm sorry, I didn't... 
 I didn't think to see it like that. 
 Yeah, well, that's the problem, nobody does. 
 So then you gotta tell them. 
 When, how? 
 Every conversation I've ever had with Elizabeth is her telling me what I've done wrong. 
 My opinion does not matter to her. 
 I wouldn't be so sure about that. 
 I mean, when she was interrogating me, she never asked me a single question about Lori. 
 All she wanted to do was talk about you. 
 So, uh, how does this work? 
 This is a safe space. 
 We do only two things in here. 
 We speak, and we listen. 
 Would you like to go first? 
 I didn't see that coming. 
 And when we speak, we do it so everyone can hear. 
 You can go first. No, clearly the doctor finds you much more fascinating than me. 
 The only fascinating thing about me is that I'm your sister. 
 Taylor, the only thing fascinating about me is that I was abducted. 
 That's the only thing anyone even really knows about me or cares about. 
 What would you like us to know? 
 Well, I'm trying to figure that out myself. 
 Can you talk a little more about that? 
 Well, it's... it's hard because... 
 Because I have to do it with everyone watching me. 
 I feel like some elephant who accidentally got assigned to the penguin house, you know? 
 It's so obvious that I'm an elephant. 
 But people keep coming up to me with a clipboard and saying, "Hmm, you know, according to this, you're, uh, you're actually a penguin." 
 Actually, I also feel like that except in my version, I'm an Armadillo and they're giraffes. 
 At least, the penguins can see the elephant but they don't even know I'm down there. 
 I know you're down there. 
 Elizabeth, you've been very quiet. 
 Uh, it's just... it's just hard to hear what terrible parents we've been. 
 Not him, you. 
 What has he done that I haven't? 
 Well, for starters, he's never lied to my face. 
 He's not spying on me, he's not recording everything I say. 
 And with him, I don't have to be in a room like this for him to listen to me. 
 I asked him not to write that book, "Finding Carter," and he's not. 
 Do you have to do that, rub it in my face? 
 That wasn't even about you, that was about me and him. 
 I've been married to this man for 17 years, Carter. 
 You just met him. Yes, it was between you and him. 
 But it was also between him and me. 
 Let's open the discussion back up. 
 I'd like to go back to what you were saying to your mother. 
 Oh, please don't use that word. 
 My mother is not here. 
 I can't see her, I can't talk to her. 
 She is not my mother and she will never be my mother because she is the person who is hunting my mother. 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Hey, Armadillo. 
 Hey, Elephant. 
 Well, I guess that'll teach you to invite me to family therapy again. 
 I think it could help. 
 Well, I can tell you that kind of stuff is a lot more fun when you're high. 
 Taylor's right, don't use me as a role model. 
 Last time, ma... Elizabeth made this whole speech to your empty chair. 
 She described the day she came home and you weren't there. 
 It sounded pretty... horrible. 
 Yeah, I'm sure it did. 
 And how she's afraid she'll have to go through it again. 
 Will she? 
 Will I? 
 Grant... I don't know. 
 I would tell you if I did. 
 But the not knowing is just as hard for me. 
 But you wanna go, right? 
 If Lori showed up. 
 She's my mother. 
 And I'm your brother and Taylor's your sister, and you have a dad now. 
 That's not enough for you, is it? 
 You'd still leave us. 
 I can't answer that. 
 You already did. 
 She found your escape backpack... Elizabeth. 
 What? 
 It's gone. 
 Carter wait. 
 She took it. 
 No, no, she didn't. 
 This woman is insane. 
 She is insane. 
 She tells me she is scared I'll leave, but then she does absolutely everything in her power to push me away from her. 
 She lies to me, she spies on me, she steals from me. 
 She has absolutely no idea what this might be like for me, and she is deliberately trying to make me mad. 
 Well, guess what, it worked, I'm mad. 
 And she is not gonna like me when I'm mad. 
 I'll just try acting a lot more like Taylor, but not with the cooking or anything. 
 Or maybe with the cooking, actually. 
 But I'll just start being really like nice and polite, like I really want this to work. 
 And then I'll just start doing little things like hiding her stuff, like her reading glasses or her driver's license or, ooh, her detective shield. 
 And then I'll, um, I'll just start cutting little holes in her clothes. 
 Carter? 
 Have you ever heard the saying that holding on to anger is like swallowing poison and hoping the other person will die?... 
 No. 
 But you heard it right now. 
 When I said it. 
 What's your point? 
 Okay, well, how about instead of thinking about ways to make Elizabeth miserable, you find a way to make you happy. 
 Why take the long way when there's a shortcut? 
 I'm just saying. 
 Molly? 
 You ever tried it? 
 No. 
 I did it, once... it was not for me. 
 I was in much too good a mood for much too long a time. 
 While you, on the other hand, have been unhappy for a while now. 
 I just think you could use a vacation. 
 And don't worry, it's very pure and very safe. 
 Yes, we get it from this guy, Crash. 
 If drug dealers were on yelp, he would be getting five stars. 
 You know, for drug dealers. 
 That's a potentially huge idea. 
 I'm not taking it alone. 
 You won't.

 Are you good enough to take no for an answer? 
 I can't. 
 You can't? 
 There's a million chicks who'd love to go out with you. 
 They're not her. 
 I wish I had your problems. 
 (Cheering) 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 Whoo! 
 Now I'm supposed to tell her she's grounded? 
 I love the job of nerd sister. 
 Ha-ha! 
 Yeah, she probably won't be ready to leave for about six hours, my best guess. 
 My mom does not wanna hear that.

 Gosh, you look so much like Elizabeth when you pull that face. 
 Doesn't she look like Elizabeth when she pulls that face? 
 (Chuckling) 
 Do you think this is cute? 
 This isn't cute... you're high. 
 You're making a fool of yourself. 
 I liked you better when I thought you were dead. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Very funny. 
 She's having a seizure. 
 Hey, call 9-1-1. 
 Carter! 
 I'm so sorry! 
 Call 9-1-1. 
 I didn't mean it! 
 Come on, come on. Call 9-1-1, man! 
 Don't leave me, Carter. I can't lose you again. 
 Carter. 
 Carter. 
 Mom? 
 I'm here. 
 Don't leave me, Carter. 
 I'm right here. 
 I'm right here. 
 [Groans] 
 How long have I been here? 
 Three years. 
 Three years? 
 I'm kidding, but... 
 (Sighing) 
 You've been out for a while. 
 But not a coma, right? 
 Technically, a coma. 
 I was in a coma? 
 It was a little coma. 
 Just long enough to scare us all to death. 
 Why does all the fun stuff happen to you? 
 Abduction, seizure, coma. 
 (Exhaling) 
 I kissed Gabe, didn't I? 
 Oh, yes, you certainly did. 
 Taylor... 
 I really don't like him. 
 Except, you do... 
 Which is fine with me. 
 Or it will be, maybe. 
 Just get better. 
 Guys, let's let her get some rest. 
 I'll call your folks, let 'em know she's up. 
 Thank you. 
 (Door opening) 
 I'm not staying but I... 
 (Door closing) 
 I, I just wanted to give you this.

 Hey, Armadillo. 
 Hey, you're up. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I should've told you this sooner. 
 Because then maybe you wouldn't be here. 
 Elizabeth didn't take your backpack. 
 I did. 
 You did? 
 I didn't want you to leave. 
 But I really don't want you to die. 
 I just... I want you to be someplace you're happy. 
 And I get that it's not here. 
 I put a burner phone in here. 
 (Exhaling) 
 So call me. 
 David, oh, my God. 
 A coma, how is she? 
 She's fine, absolutely fine. 
 Oh, thank God... that would not be good for anyone if she overdosed on drugs her first month home. 
 So what's the good word? 
 What's the great word, you mean? 
 People are loving... Loving your sample chapter. 
 But now, between this YouTube video and the coma, oh. 
 You ain't even heard our family therapy session. 
 She is not my mother and she will never be my mother. 
 Because she is the person who is hunting my mother. 
 That's Eliza... she's talking about Elizabeth? 
 This next book of yours, "Finding Carter"... 
 It's gonna be huge.

 (Elizabeth) We have a problem. 
 What are you writing that will put food on our table? 
 Just trust me... can you do that? 
 Hey, I'm Crash. 
 You were at the police station earlier. 
 (Elizabeth) She cannot get sucked into this guy's life. 
 The only thing I really want is to be at home with my real mom. 
 That's all I want too. 
 (Elizabeth) You can never have anything to do with him again. 
 Do you understand me? 
 (Carter) Yeah, I understand you. 
 Do you understand me? 
 (Carter) I thought you were my friend. 
 I thought you were mine. 
 Stop! 
 Will you get off of me? 
 We wanna help her find her mom. 
 You are just determined to be her knight in shiny armor, aren't you? 
 You know Crash. 
 This was inevitable. 
 No, I'm inevitable. 
 The other night? 
 That was a lot of fun. 
 Can you save some oxygen for the rest of us, please? 
 I don't know what that was. 
 I can't stay here and be with my mom at the same time. 
 I have to choose. 
 Everyone always says it's so great being a twin but they wouldn't say that if they had to be your twin. 
 You are too tiny to carry this enormous burden. 
 Your mom is here. 
 Love you more. 
 Not possible. 
 Yes, possible.
