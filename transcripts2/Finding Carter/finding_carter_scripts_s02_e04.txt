 Carter : Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old. 
 This is the lie that is going to destroy us. 
 You tell her now she might forgive you. 
 She won't. 
 I can't even begin to understand any of this. 
 I should have told you years ago. 
 I guess thirteen years of Carter's life wasn't enough for Lori. 
 She had to take you and Taylor from me, too. 
 Your father and I are separating. 
 Seems like mom and I are dumping all our problems on you. 
 I'm gonna do everything I can to work this out. 
 My grandparents' party is tonight. 
 What about Taylor? 
 You love her. 
 You two are so good together. 
 Nothing's changed. 
 You still let that guy back into your life. 
 I need to take a step back. 
 You made an offer yesterday. 
 Something about a job opportunity. 
 Come on. 
 Why did you come here? 
 I won't come back. 
 I can't think about this. 
 (Phone buzzing) 
 It's Lori? 
 You need to leave my family alone now. 
 Where does it all go? 
 The gluten they're taking out of all this food. 
 I mean, it's got to go somewhere, right? 
 It's like they're stored in a cave, in Nevada or something like that. 
 One of these days, they're gonna realize it's good for you again. 
 Someone's gonna bank some serious green selling all that gluten back to everybody. 
 I hear that. 
 Carter! 
 Why aren't you guys in the Sanctuary? 
 We needed mixers. 
 What can I make for you? 
 Um... 
 I don't know. 
 House special. 
 Good. 
 Because we are running low on everything. 
 Is that Max's t-shirt? 
 Yeah. 
 It looks good on me, right. 
 Yeah, where'd you get it? 
 He gave it to me. 
 Okay, fine, I took it. 
 It was payment for letting him crash last night. 
 Is it party time already? 
 Hey. 
 Gabe : Max. 
 Hey. 
 I've been trying to call you like a million times. 
 Sorry, I've been busy at the new job. 
 Working for Crash's uncle at the body shop. 
 Max, your beverage. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Bird : There you go. 
 Hey, you. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 Oh, just living the fascinating life of a reformed criminal. 
 Well, um... 
 Thanks for looking after Max. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Everybody back together. 
 Just like old times. 
 To old times. 
 To old times. 
 Old times. 
 And to moving on. 
 (Sirens approaching) 
 (Tires screeching) 
 Please tell me those are not cops in your driveway. 
 That's not the cops in your driveway. 
 Thank God. 
 It's the FBI. 
 The FBI? 
 That doesn't make it any better. 
 Bird, what's going on? 
 Man over megaphone :  Everyone inside. 
 Bird? 
 Exit the premises. 
 Everybody out, now! 
 Bird, we're not leaving you. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Go. 
 Bird, I'm gonna stay. 
 I said everyone! 
 Yeah, we don't even know what this is about. 
 Yeah, and I'm sure you don't want to stay and find out. 
 Everything is fine. (Exhaling) 
 Carter, I said leave. 
 No, I'm not going. 
 I can handle it. 
 Bird, you don't have to be so brave all the time. It's okay to be scared. 
 Yeah, now isn't the time to be discussing my emotional defense mechanisms. 
 Okay, fine, whatever, I'm not leaving.

 Mass mortgage fraud, really? 
 That's so not even a thing. 
 Bird, where are your parents? 
 They don't keep track of me, I don't keep track of them. 
 Why is nobody answering? 
 Who are you calling? 
 Who do you think? 
 My "in case of emergency" contacts. 
 My parents' lawyers. 
 You know, I thought it was odd when my parents packed up and left as quickly as they did. 
 Then again, my parents are odd people. 
 I just have a hard time believing they would knowingly leave me to face the FBI. 
 Wait, you don't think they would clear out the Sanctuary, do you? 
 They're the FBI, I'm pretty sure they can do whatever they want. 
 Woman :  Still no answer, would you like to leave a message? 
 Screw this! No! 
 I don't want to leave a message! 
 I'm gonna raise some serious hell when this is over. 
 ♪ Oh ♪ 
♪ You're stuck inside my heart... ♪ 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you still doing here? 
 I was just waiting around to make sure everything's okay. 
 Oh. 
 Thanks. 
 So is it okay? 
 The FBI is after Bird's parents and everything they own. 
 She just got in touch with their lawyers, so I don't know, it may be okay. 
 What about you. 
 Me? 
 Well, I'd be lying if I said that flashing lights and swarms of law enforcement officers didn't bring back some not-so-fun memories. 
 Well, if you need anything... 
 Like what, exactly? 
 I'm here for you. 
 Bye, Crash. 
 (Door opening) 
 (Door closing) 
 (Engine starting) 
 They're both really funny to watch fall down the stairs. 
 That's terrible. 
 I know. (Chuckling) 
 (Door closing) 
 Oh, company. 
 Carter, this is Hillary. 
 Hi. 
 You're Carter. Cool. 
 And you're Hillary. 
 Oh, I'm your dad's teaching assistant. 
 She's dropping off tomorrow's assignment. 
 Yeah, a T.A.'S work is never done. 
 And she's funny, too. 
 At least dad seems to think so. 
 Really? 
 What? 
 Maybe you should go to your room. 
 No problem. 
 (Footsteps fading) 
 Everything okay? 
 Um... 
 Yeah, there was some excitement at Bird's, but everything's fine. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I think I'm gonna go to my room. 
 It was nice to meet you. 
 (Footsteps fading) 
 ## 
 Wow. 
 Grant hates Hillary. 
 Yeah, well, it's obvious to him that she's just worming her way into our lives. 
 You mean dad's life? 
 Same difference. 
 Tay. 
 Mom and dad are just taking a break, okay? 
 They're not opening up their relationship to... 
 Clichês? 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 How was Bird's? 
 Oh, God, you don't want to know. 
 What? 
 Well, there was an FBI raid, so there's that. 
 I always miss the exciting stuff. 
 Yeah, well, I'll spare you all the details. 
 I'm sure they'll be all anyone is talking about tomorrow at school. 
 Her parents? 
 Yeah. 
 I always thought they were shady, but I just never thought they were, you know, FBI raid shady. 
 Well, how is Bird. Is she okay? 
 You know Bird. 
 Even if she wasn't, she'd never tell anyone. 
 But Max is staying with her, so at least she's not alone. 
 At... at Bird's? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Apparently, it's just temporary. 
 Did she... 
 She ask him to stay there? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Was it his idea? 
 I don't know, Tay. 
 You don't think that they're... together. Do you? 
 No, of course not. 
 Good news, he's staying in town. 
 Got a job. 
 Where? 
 I don't know, some garage somewhere with Crash's uncle. 
 Crash's uncle. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Crash works there, too. 
 (Phone buzzing) 
 (Key beeps) 
 Hello? 
 Yeah, this is Carter. 
 Yeah, I can... 
 Yeah, I can meet you there. 
 Okay. 
 All right, bye. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 That was Lori's ex from, like, seven years ago. 
 He wants to meet me for coffee tomorrow morning. 
 (Crowd chatter, plates clanking) 
 There you are. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Sit, sit, please. 
 Thanks. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You remember me at all? 
 Yeah, I remember you. 
 I remember that rose tattoo on your neck. 
 Yeah. 
 Got a bit more ink since then. 
 So what did you want to talk about? 
 Lori gave me your contact information. 
 I hope it's okay that I called you. 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 There are some things that we should discuss, hmm? 
 Oh, hey, good. 
 I didn't miss you. 
 How are you? 
 Where's Carter? 
 She went to get coffee with someone. 
 Who? 
 Someone, I don't know. 
 We ran out of bread. 
 Yeah, and... and juice. 
 That's what the list on the fridge is for, things we need. 
 Wait, we're supposed to use that? 
 Hey. 
 I didn't know you were still here. 
 Yeah, my... my morning got off to a slow start. 
 I was up late grading papers. 
 Among other things. 
 What things? 
 Hillary came by. 
 We talked shop. 
 Oh. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 I didn't say anything. 
 We have a question. 
 How long is this separation thing gonna last? 
 Your mom and I really hav... 
 We still have some things that we need to work through. 
 We need a little time to let things breathe. 
 Settle down, you know? 
 So basically, you have no idea. 
 You know what I think we need? 
 A calendar to let you know which one of us is going to stay at the house and when, that kind of thing. 
 David : Excellent idea. 
 A calendar. 
 Wow. 
 So helpful. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, so you want to get the stuff on the list or do you want to make up the schedule? 
 I'll get the groceries. 
 Did you mean what you said about us working things out? 
 Yeah, yes. 
 I did. 
 Mood stabilizers? 
 She'd been on 'em a while when I met her. 
 She went off her meds a couple times when we were together. 
 She'd get paranoid, depressed. 
 She'd tell me that she didn't want to see me again and three days later, she'd show up at my doorstep ready to elope. 
 (Laughs) 
 Wow. 
 That sounds rough. 
 Yeah. It's fine. 
 She's the one you should feel bad for. 
 Right. 
 You're still upset with her. 
 That would be a bit of an understatement, yes. 
 I... I get it. Trust me, I get it. 
 It's like she turned into this other person. 
 Like everything I remember about her, just... 
 I don't know. 
 It wasn't real. 
 She was off her meds 'cause she was on the run. 
 In my understanding, she didn't take her meds the first time she did it, either. 
 Why are you telling me all of this, Allan? 
 Lori, needs your help. 
 She's been declared mentally competent by the state. 
 When she goes away, she's gonna go away for a very long time. 
 Trust me. 
 Prison is no place for somebody who is... 
 Crazy? 
 Yeah. Crazy. 
 She needs proper care. 
 She needs to be in a mental hospital where they can monitor her. 
 Ugh, this is so messed up. 
 I don't even remember her having crazy mood swings like that. 
 All I remember is how good she was to me, and how normal she was. 
 What is it you want me to do? 
 She needs an expert witness. 
 Someone who could testify to the state that Lori's off her rocker. 
 Look, I don't want her to suffer. 
 But why me? 
 You're her daughter. 
 She begged me to come here today. 
 (Clanking) 
 Something I love is a man who cleans up after himself. 
 Yeah, I'm not cleaning up after myself. 
 I'm cleaning up after everyone else. 
 I was just checking in to see how you kids are holding up with this nesting arrangement your parents have going. 
 It's going. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 The whole thing is idiotic. 
 I mean, two people either want to be together or they don't, and all this, you know, we're taking a break, working things out talk is bull. 
 All right, I just want to know who the last person was to put their dirty dishes in here. 
 I mean, seriously, how hard is it to look at this and just go, 
 "oh, the dishwasher's full, maybe I should start it up." 
 They're a bunch of losers, just... 
 (Slamming door, dishes clanking) 
 (Crowd chatter) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Can you come over here for a minute? 
 How are you doing? 
 I didn't sleep well knowing they could bust into the Sanctuary at any moment just like they did at my parents' house. 
 You know, you can always stay at mine if they did, okay? 
 My parents should be home any day. 
 Did you talk to them? 
 Do you promise you won't say anything? 
 What? 
 Some files they had me store in the Sanctuary. 
 Well, they want me to destroy them before they come home. 
 I'm pretty sure it's evidence and I'm pretty sure I can be in a lot of trouble if I tamper with it. 
 Yeah, but I mean, what happens to your parents if you don't do it? 
 So, I don't really have a choice, do I? 
 Thanks, mom and dad. 
 What happened? 
 Lori needs my help. 
 Okay, what kind of help? 
 Legal stuff. 
 She needs someone to testify that she's mentally unstable, which I don't... 
 I don't even know how I feel about. 
 Well, there's one thing we can do that can make us both feel better. 
 What? 
 The way I see it, if the FBI is gonna confiscate my parents' house and everything in it, we may as well help them redecorate. 
 ## 
 Ofe : Order's up. 
 Half a dozen little study buddies. 
 (Lid popping, pills rattling) 
 You are the man. 
 Oh, hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hear about Bird's party tomorrow night? 
 Didn't the FBI seize her parents' house? 
 Thus the party. 
 That sounds like a great idea. 
 I think I'll pass. 
 Come on, is this about Max? 
 What about him? 
 'Cause he's staying over there and you don't want to see him. 
 Well, he's also working with Crash, another person I don't want to see. 
 Well, in any case, everyone's gonna be there if you change your mind. 
 Maybe I will. 
 I'll swing by and give you a ride. 
 Cool. 
 Cool. 
 Hey. 
 It's me. 
 Yeah, I did it. 
 I'm pretty sure you're gonna be hearing from her. 
 And Lori. 
 Remember. 
 You owe me. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 
 
 
 # # 
 (Knocking) 
 Hey. 
 Someone's up early. 
 Um. 
 I wanted to talk to you about something. 
 Okay. Shoot. 
 (Door closes) 
 ## 
 Okay, before I say anything, I want you to know that I'm not even sure how I feel about this. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's Lori. 
 Okay. 
 What's going on? 
 She's not well. 
 Mentally, I mean. 
 Well, Carter, that's not exactly surprising. 
 Right, but according to state, she's competent to stand trial and maybe go to prison. 
 And you don't agree with that? 
 I don't know if I agree or not. 
 But mom... 
 If there's actually something wrong with her, then she deserves to go to a mental hospital, not some prison somewhere where who knows what could happen to her. 
 Baby, I'm sorry, but I can't help but think this is Lori's issue. 
 What does it have to do with you? 
 She wants me to help her get a private mental evaluation. 
 You've been in contact with her? 
 No. 
 One of her ex-boyfriends got in contact with me. 
 I used to know him when I was younger. 
 Anyway, I found this woman who can help, but she costs, like, 
 $2,000, which I don't exactly... 
 No, Carter, please. 
 Do not get sucked back into Lori's issues. 
 Okay, I know what this sounds like, all right? 
 Do you? 
 Because it sounds like you're being manipulated by her and you're feeding right into it. 
 Carter, are you really willing to let Lori back into our lives after everything that she put us through? 
 Because I'm not. 
 I'm not gonna let it happen. 
 Okay, look. 
 I'm very aware of the fact that, yeah, this might just be another lie that I'm being fed. 
 But mom... 
 What if this isn't a lie? 
 And Lori is actually sick and I just sat back and didn't do anything to help her? 
 I don't know if I could live with that. 
 You've got to hear me when I tell you this. 
 There's a system in place to help people like Lori. 
 So people like you and me, we can move on with our lives. 
 You've got to trust that.

 Oh, that's my friend Pat, hi! 
 Hi. 
 Grant, this is my friend Patricia. 
 This is my grandson, Grant. 
 Hello, Grant. Lovely to meet you. 
 Would you two care to join me? 
 We would love to. 
 (Crowd chatter, plates clanking) 
 So, Grant, your grandmother tells me that there have been some pretty big changes going on over at your house. 
 Mom and dad moving out. 
 Sister's finding out some pretty big news about their biological mother. 
 I guess so. 
 You know, Grant, sometimes it's good for you to just... 
 Say what you're feeling right out loud. 
 Are you, like, a shrink or something? 
 You know, honey, I was worried. 
 With so many things going on at the house, I was afraid you might be feeling like you were slipping through the cracks. 
 A little late for that, don't you think? 
 Not really. 
 Well, I just don't appreciate being lied to, not that I'm not used to it at this point. 
 Can we order now? 
 (Tool whirring) 
 ## 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 I was just wondering if there was any way your uncle might need an extra employee around here. 
 Uh... 
 I don't think so. 
 Really? 
 I can do anything, like, file, clean, run errands, whatever. 
 What's going on? 
 Lori needs an expert witness to testify that she's mentally unstable so that instead of going to prison, she'll be put in a mental institution. 
 Said expert witness costs $2,000, which I do not have. 
 Therefore, I need a job. 
 When did Lori come back into the picture? 
 Look, there are some things that I found out about recently, things that I didn't know before that are making me reconsider just how fair it would be to let them throw her in prison. 
 So you're looking for an excuse to forgive her. 
 No, that's not what this is. 
 Anyway, you're one to talk. 
 I never did anything to you that you weren't a part of. 
 The same can't be said for that woman. 
 Great. 
 Okay. 
 Well, you said if I ever needed anything that I should come to you. 
 I guess not. 
 Thanks anyway.

 This is what I was looking for. I'll be right back.

 Hey, where have you been? 
 Where have we been? 
 Let's see. We went to lunch. 
 We ran some errands and then Buddy made us dinner. 
 Basically, grandma took me to a shrink. 
 Excuse me? 
 My friend Patricia joined us for lunch and yes, she's a psychiatrist, but it was perfectly innocent, I assure you. 
 Mom, nothing with you is innocent. 
 Okay, maybe that part was a little calculated, but do you know, Grant has not been himself lately, and with everything that's been going on around here, don't hate me because I'm a little concerned. 
 Again. 
 I'm right here, I can hear you. 
 Yes, you are absolutely right. 
 Go. 
 Go. 
 Mom. 
 This is  not  okay. 
 You are overstepping, and by the way, Grant is fine. 
 You know, I didn't expect a thank you, but I would have liked a little bit more than just total denial. 
 I am not in denial. 
 Oh, really? 
 That boy needs someone to talk to. 
 And some daughters would be grateful to have a mother who was so observant... 
 Mom. 
 Ugh, all right, I'll go. 
 You don't have to ask me twice.

 Hey. 
 Oh! 
 Look who's here.

 Wow. Bad time?

 You know, it's just that we're the kids, the one's who are supposed to be getting into trouble and causing problems. 
 And yet, we're the ones doing all the adult stuff while our parents are out there being irresponsible and reckless. 
 Yeah, I'm starting to think it might be nice if all I had to worry about was prom and whether or not I'm gonna look like a dork in my yearbook photo, rather than constantly feeling like I have to hold my family together. 
 To... adulting. 
 To adulting. 
 (Cups clacking) 
 So does this mean you figured out what to do with those files? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 But I didn't do it to save them. 
 I did it to save myself. 
 Oh, Bird, come here.

 Hey, buddy, what's up? 
 I need to know something. 
 Okay. 
 I want to know why you and mom said you were working on things when you're hanging out with Hillary and I saw mom kissing Kyle last night. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for whatever it is you saw. 
 For the record, I don't care if you guys stay together or break up, it's your choice. 
 But I just don't like the mixed messages, and with everything we've all been through, I just don't think it's a lot asking for my parents to be straight with me. 
 Yeah, no, that's... 
 Completely understandable. 
 I appreciate you saying so. 
 That's it? That's all you got? 
 Well, I don't know exactly what else to say, son. 
 Figures. 
 (Door sliding, closing) 
 ## 
 Oh, my Gosh. 
 It's so good to see you, baby. 
 Um, oh. I... 
 I'm sorry, I must look awful. 
 It's kind of hard to keep it together in here. 
 Um, this is Sophia Sing. 
 She's a psychiatrist. 
 She's gonna help you. 
 Yes, of course. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Shall we get started?

 It's safe to show my face? 
 It's dad's day to nest, don't worry. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Why, you want to take me to another head shrinker? 
 Well... 
 Pat would like to see you again if you're up for that. 
 Yeah, but mom says... 
 I know what mom said. 
 But she doesn't have to know. 
 So you want me to talk and then you don't want me to talk. 
 I mean, what am I supposed to do? 
 Okay, um... 
 I'm just trying to look out for you, that's all. 
 It... it's your choice. 
 Yeah, well, I tried to talk with dad today, but that was pretty pointless. 
 That didn't make you feel any better? 
 Okay. I'll... I'll do it. 
 I'll see your friend again. 
 Okay. 
 Sophia : According to the warden,  you've requested sleep aids multiple times. 
 It's not easy to get any rest in here. 
 Do you have a doctor I can contact to verify your prescriptions? 
 There's been a lot of doctors and I've used a lot of aliases over the last few years, so I really can't remember who to even refer you to. 
 Well, who was your most recent physician? 
 I was really hoping you would come today. 
 I have missed you so much. 
 Miss Stevens, I really need you to stay focused on our work here if you can. 
 You know, how many more questions do you need me to answer? 
 We've been talking almost an hour. 
 You have your money, can't you just sign whatever you need to sign and be on your way? 
 Miss Stevens, it doesn't work like that. 
 I have to verify... 
 That I'm crazy? 
 Yeah. 
 I know you do. 
 What more do you want me to say? 
 Want me to start screaming and pulling out my hair? 
 Want me to threaten to kill myself? 'Cause I can do that. 
 I think about it every time I think about never seeing my daughter again. 
 Mom, calm down. 
 You called me mom. 
 I never thought I'd hear you call me that again. 
 Miss Stevens. 
 I don't want to talk to you anymore. 
 Carter. 
 You know I'm not crazy. 
 This was the only way. 
 If I go to prison, I will hardly ever see you, but if I go to a hospital, you can come visit me whenever you want. 
 Miss Stevens, I really must insist that you focus, or I will have to ask Carter to leave the room. 
 Carter, just tell me you forgive me. 
 Please. 
 Just tell me everything will be back the way it was before, 
 'cause when I get out of here... 
 Stop. 
 You really don't understand what you've done, do you? 
 You're not getting out of here. 
 And even if you were... 
 Things would never be the same between us. 
 Don't say that. Don't say that. 
 Don't... don't, please. No, I'm... 
 Things will go back to the way they were eventually, it has to. 
 Carter, I need you to leave. 
 No, you leave! 
 Carter. 
 No, Carter, please. Please. 
 You know... 
 When Allan came to me and told me that you needed my help, I did wonder whether or not it was genuine, or whether this was just another way for you to manipulate me. 
 But I decided to give you the benefit of the doubt again and do this for you. 
 And now that I've come here today and I've seen you, I am so glad that I did. 
 Because Lori, you are ill, whether you realize it or not. 
 And I'm sorry for you. 
 I really, really am. 
 No, Carter! Carter, no! 
 Carter! 
 Carter!

 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Class assignments for tomorrow. 
 Oh, excellent. 
 And I was thinking, if you're not busy, maybe we could go grab a beer? 
 Talk over the new syllabus? 
 You're probably busy. 
 Maybe another time. 
 I... actually... 
 Yeah? 
 I was thinking earlier, it would be nice to go out and there's a new little bar around the corner. 
 I happen to love little bars around the corner.
