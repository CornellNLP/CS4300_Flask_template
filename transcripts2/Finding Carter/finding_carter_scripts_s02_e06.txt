 Previously on "Finding Carter..." 
 Ofe : We've hooked up five times this week. 
 Each time, you take off the second it's over. 
 Taylor : I thought that this was just a friends-with-benefits thing. Doesn't have to be. Ofe : Order's up. Half a dozen little study buddies. Boy : You are the man. Do you have any lip gloss? Uh, yeah, it's in the top drawer. Is this why mom and dad are separated? Is it true? Did you have an affair with Lori? It's true. I knew it. Hey, how was your study session? Carter : I wasn't studying. I was with Crash. Why would you let him back in your life? This is my uncle Shay. Thank you for everything you did for Crash. Hey, Crash is family. Never turn your back on family. Crash : Max, I need a favor. Shay just called. He's got a job he wants me to do tonight. Is there any chance you can do it? Max : Yeah. Make sure to lock this place up extra tight. Max : You set me up. The car you had dropped off last night? Crash : What about it? Are you really gonna stand there How many times do I have to tell you? It wasn't me. Max : I find that very hard to believe. Whatever you saw, I swear, I had nothing to do with it. What part? The guy with the prison tattoos or the 15 pounds of coke? Whoa. What's going on? We planning Bird's next party? Talking about Shay. I'm pretty sure your uncle's not invited, Crash. Max thinks he's running drugs. What? Max, come on. I was supposed to make sure that a car got into the garage last night. Okay. Crash was supposed to do the job, then he conveniently, at the last minute, passed it onto me. Because I was with Carter. So I get the car in, I pop the trunk and there it is. It's like a winter wonderland. I didn't know. Your uncle didn't tell you anything? I swear. That's not good enough. You've come very close to destroying a bunch of lives in the past, including both of ours. I'm telling you, I didn't know. How is that possible, dude? You've been working there for months. What are you saying? Once a drug dealer, always a drug dealer? It's got to get easier to convince yourself that it's not a big deal every time, right? I'm not that guy anymore. I thought you knew that. Tell him, Carter. I really want to, Crash. Really? That money you gave me for Lori? Is this where it came from? I can't believe this. I tried to do it all right this time. All I wanted was a clean slate. Crash. Crash, don't leave. No. If I can't even convince you, maybe I should stop trying to convince myself. ♪ There you go ♪

(Cell phone beeping) (Door closing) Somebody missed her curfew. Wow. You know, it looks like she had way more fun tonight than I did. It was just a drink after work. Is that what the kids are calling it these days? Carter, it was nothing. Mom, it's after midnight. So, uh... How long does nothing take with Kyle, anyway? It was just a date. One date. I have a European History test tomorrow. I wanted you to hear it from me first. You know, you're the only one here who didn't already think you were dating Kyle. It's kind of the obvious extension of nesting. We are not dating. It was a date. That's not denial. That's a denial. 50% of kids have parents who get divorced. Now, I always wondered how the other half lived. We're not getting divorced. We're not even thinking about getting a divorce. So you're just married and dating other people? Don't forget nesting. Marriage is complicated. Your dad and I are just working out some kinks. Okay. I can't deal with this right now. So, uh, whose kinks should we expect tonight? Yours and Kyle's or dad's? This family needs a reality show. ♪♪

♪ You know on the seventh day, God rested, right? God wasn't in high school. You okay? Yeah, just... How do you do it? What? Never break a sweat? One great gift of dysfunctional families? The ability to ignore all of your problems. Yeah, well, see, my parents separated and all I get is this lousy anxiety. Is the stuff with mom really bothering you? What, her dating or her and dad lying to us about dad's affair with Lori? Either? Both? No more than anything else. Then again... I did have a panic attack last night trying to figure out what to wear to bed, so... Have you talked to your therapist about it? Yeah. We tried meditation tapes last week. And? I fell asleep. Yesterday, she asked me if I wanted to try pills. Pills? What do you think? Isn't Carter kind of the go-to drug advisor? Yeah, but you're the, uh... Has-it-all-figured-out advisor. I've known a lot of kids that become dependent on their meds, and they start to use them irresponsibly. Plus... I think that you have a lot of other options. Like what? You might be too cynical for it. Try me. You know, this pushes my limits. But... it's surprisingly effective. My office is open anytime. Thanks. Crash : What else do you have in the cars? Shay : What's that supposed to mean? I mean Max found the coke in the car. What was Max doing in my car? When I give you a job, you do it. Is Goldilocks gonna snitch? No, Max knows better than that. For his sake, I hope so. What if we had been caught. I've been doing this 15 years. Let me worry about what-if. Yeah, well, I'm on probation. I could end up back in jail for half my life because of your little side business. Well, the money from my little side business got you out of prison. So what, you think I owe you? I saved you. I knew you couldn't handle knowing how. You should have told me. It should have been my decision. People like us don't get to decide. You know, you can dress yourself up like those kids you used to deal to. You're never gonna be one of them. Who the hell are you? Uh, I was just leaving. Not so fast. What's this? What are you doing here? She's trespassing. Look, I am sorry to bother you. This was obviously a really bad time. Shay : Hold on. You're Crash's girlfriend. What's your name again? Carter. Carter. You can go. I don't see a broken car. What are you doing here? I came to see Crash. He's a little busy right now. Okay, you should go, I'll talk to you later... Shay : No. Maybe she should stay. Someone's listening to my private business, it concerns me. She doesn't care what you do. Maybe she's the reason you're thinking you're better than me. He is better than you. Yeah? He didn't used to be. Maybe I should spend a little time with you. I'll get better, too. All right, we're done here. Let's go. You know, your father tried to get away from the life, too. Look what happened to him. I'm out. Are you not hearing me? There is no out. ♪♪ What happens now? Clean slate. You need a new place to live. I have enough cash for a night in a motel. It might not have cable, but... Then what, Crash? Sleep in my truck. Outside? My dad and I slept in his truck for a month. When? When I was a kid, before he left for Iraq. I was five, I loved it. No, that's crazy. You can't stay in your truck. No trucks, no motels. Well, we could try to make it work here. You're gonna have to stay at my house. It's safer. Your house? Yeah. And what about your mom and your dad? And your sister, who hates me? Okay, firstly, she doesn't hate you, Crash. Secondly, dad will go along with whatever my mom says. And my mom will be fine as long as we tell her about the drugs. What? No. We can't tell her. Why? She's a cop, she could probably help. 'Cause I'm not a snitch. And Shay is right about one thing. He's the only reason I'm not in prison. I'm not gonna send him to prison. All right, I won't tell her about the drugs, I will just... Get down on my knees and beg her. Carter, I don't think Elizabeth is gonna listen to you on this one. That's a very good point, Max. I don't think she will listen... To me. It's just one night. Max, you know I would do anything for you, don't you? But Crash isn't coming into my house for one minute. Elizabeth, you know I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important. He's in a lot of trouble. Some call that an occupational hazard of lying, cheating and stealing. Crash's own uncle is threatening him. He can't go back to the place that he's been living, it's not safe. What do you mean? I mean he's in danger. From his uncle? He's a bad guy. Well, what kind of danger? Physical? Is he being roughed up? I probably shouldn't say anymore. Why? Crash, he doesn't want anybody to know how scared he is. It's that serious? More. Well, I hope he's not blaming himself, because I've seen all kinds of people in violent-home situations. He's used to taking care of himself. But right now, he's up against something that he can't handle alone. Max... Crash left you to die. Why do you care what happens to him? I guess... Somewhere along the way, we accidentally became friends. (Mattress inflating) Okay, ground rules. One, you guys are all in by curfew. Two, lights out early. Three through ten, Crash sleeps on this mattress. And not in your bed. Absolutely, yes. Check, check, check. I really appreciate you for doing this. And 11 through 20, you sleep in your bed and not on this mattress. David : Hello, anybody home? (Door closing) Hi. Oh, everyone's home. And not leaving anytime soon. This isn't for me. It's for Crash. That's weird. You have another friend named Crash. Because the Crash I know would never be staying in our house. She's staying here, too. I don't understand. I've been away one night. What happened? I, uh... I think you got this one. David : Elizabeth? Crash is in trouble, he needs a place to sleep and I told him he could stay here, but as long as he's here, I'm staying so I can watch him. You should have called. It just happened. We talked about this you're not the only parent here. David, please. Don't be sensitive. I'm not being sensitive. Okay, now you're being sensitive about being sensitive. I'm quickly remembering why we decided to have separate nights in the first place. You know what? I'll go. No, no, wait. Don't. You're right, I'm sorry. I should have called. That's okay. It just happened. Yeah. I'll explain over a glass of wine. Or six. And then we gotta figure out sleeping arrangements. Carter and Crash's? Ours. Oh. (Knocking) ♪♪ I just wanted to say hi. Hi. The full house tonight. I heard. You making something special for dinner? I'm making myself disappear for dinner. You look really nice... For your vanishing act. Thanks. Yeah, it's different. But nice. You feel like disappearing with me over to Bird's place for a little bit? Thanks, but, um... I already have plans. A magician never reveals her secrets, right? I'm hanging out with Ofe. Oh. So you guys are hanging out. I guess you had a better time than the rest of us at the fair. Not really. He spent the whole time trying to win that. That's not exactly my thing, but Ofe must really like you. We're just having fun. What does "having fun" mean? Do you really want the details? So you don't actually like Ofe then? What's the difference? Well, it seems like there's a big difference. Do you want me to like Ofe? You know, I just didn't think of you as that... As what? Nothing. No, as what, Max? Well, as the kind of person that would do something like that with someone you don't really care about. What about you and Bird? How is that any different? Bird is my roommate. That makes it worse. But Bird and I aren't doing anything. Why am I even having this conversation? I don't care what you think about me. I'm going to have some fun with Ofe. Hopefully, I can avoid running into the guy that shot you on my way out. Come on, Taylor. No. It's time for your vanishing act. Okay, so my dad was only expecting four people for dinner, so I think we're gonna have to ration the stir-fry. Yep. I vote for adding ramen. It's like the weed of the pasta family. (Chuckling) Look at you. You know, scrounging is my superhero skill after all. Really? I'd call it... Doing a lot with a little. That's because your superhero skill is seeing the silver lining. What, like, uh... How even though the reason you're here is kinda screwed up, this might just end up being fun. The scrounger and the optimist. I smell a franchise. Here, can you wash this? What? I just can't believe I'm here and your mom's not throwing me out. Yes, I can't believe that either. Did you tell her that it means a lot? You tell her, she'd really appreciate it. I really appreciate you. Oh. Carter? Oh, hi. Hi. Hi, Mrs. Wilson. What's going on here? Um, we're making dinner. I don't think so. It's not date night for you two, it's not any night for you two. Mom, no one thinks this is date night. Good, because the second it starts looking like a date in here again, you're gonna find another place to stay, Crash. Carter, he's not here because he is your boyfriend. He is here because he needs our help. Do you understand that? Yeah. Good. Crash? Yes, ma'am. Oh, and don't even think about putting your overnight bag in Carter's room. And stay away from Grant. Well... Every superhero needs a villain. 
 
 ♪♪ (Groaning) Clearly, I've developed a Pavlovian response to studying European history. Euro history makes you salivate. That... And it makes me want to take your clothes off. Well, the French would be so proud. I think it makes me hungry. Right now? Yeah. I haven't eaten all day. I've been working up quite the appetite. The last 20 minutes. Or... should I say ten? 12. Hey, anyway, if you're hungry, why don't you help me solve one of life's biggest mysteries? What's the perfect post hookup, pre-study sandwich? What are the contenders? Turkey Reuben, Turkey Reuben. And Turkey Reuben. Nope. The Tryptophan would make me sleepy. I say... the Elvis. Bananas, peanut butter, bacon, fried. Okay. Well, that sounds great, but of course, the perfect sandwich is actually the one we happen to have ingredients for. Why is that? Because I have to be able to make it right now. Are you gonna make me a sandwich? Isn't that one of the known benefits of being friends with benefits? Well, if it isn't... Let's be rebels. I think I've got bit makings. It's not exactly European, but tasty. ♪♪ Taylor. Taylor! Elizabeth : Want some help? By the way, is the living room still okay? Or should we go ahead and put Crash in solitary confinement? Maybe feed him his meals through a slot in the door. Carter. Look, I really appreciate everything you're doing for him, but I don't understand why you have to be so hard on him. What, by feeding him and letting him stay here, in our home? No, I mean, like treating him like he's a criminal. He is a criminal. He was a criminal. Now he just wants a clean slate, and I think, after everything he's been through, he should get that chance. He won't. Why? Because, sweetheart, there are no clean slates. Not for any of us. You want some help with those? Oh, no, no, no, I got it, Mr. Wilson. So now, whoever cooks is supposed to be off dish duty. House rules. Those rules apply to an unwelcome house guest? Who says you're not welcome? It's kinda written all over Mrs. Wilson's face. Don't take it too personally. She might be a little biased against people she's arrested. Or whoever rolled oregano joints in her home? Not your best. Not my best. Well, I have my own bias. Against what? Not against. Toward... people who try to make up for their mistakes, and toward people who love my daughter. So he'll always be a criminal to you. You'll never accept him as what he is now because of what he once was. No. I'm not going to accept him because he's going to break your heart. And I don't want you to get hurt. Mom, I think you're the one who's afraid of heartbreak. You just can't be any more. None of us can. We've been through everything in this family, we have survived it all. Seriously, what's left to be afraid of? (Doorbell ringing) Can I help you? I'm here to pick up my nephew. What can we help you with? I'm here to talk to Crash. We understand there's been a disagreement of some kind. That's a family matter. Not anymore. (Chuckling) I can't believe you came here. How did he find out? I think he might have found you. That's mildly disturbing. I'm not looking to start anything. Folks, just let me talk to my nephew. Shay, what are you doing here? Crash, stay there. Crash, you're bothering these nice people. Let's get your things. I'll take it from here. Crash, you should get inside now. He's not going with you. I don't think you understand. I'm telling you both to go back to your business. First of all, you don't tell me what to do. You're on my property, asking to speak to someone in my house, so that makes it my business. I just hope it doesn't end up overlapping with my day job. Cop, huh? Detective. Look, I just want to make sure my nephew wasn't gonna be a bother, that's all. He's welcome here. But you need to leave. Crash, you call me when you want to come home and talk. But you shouldn't talk to anyone else in the meantime. You wouldn't want to bother them any more than you already have. Got it? (Engine revving) Thanks. I'll be down after I check on Grant. Thanks. I'm really sorry about all of that. It's not your fault, Crash. But you need to tell me what's really going on now. I can't. I can't help you if you don't let me. No one can. Mom, you heard what Shay said he was threatening him. Well, Crash wasn't the only person that Shay was threatening by showing up here tonight. I never meant for any of this to happen. Listen. If you're worried because you're part of something... He wasn't part of something. Shay's my only family. He gave me a second chance. But you don't owe a man like that anything, Crash. Family matters. But sometimes, they don't always know what's best for us. You need to tell me what you know. ♪♪ I shouldn't have come here. Crash, you don't need to say anything. No, Carter. I don't care about anyone the way I care about you. And nobody has made me a better person than you. It's not okay to come here and threaten this family. Shay's real name is Walter Chase. No, it's fine. Don't worry, it's not for you. I don't get it. One second, we're talking sandwiches, and the next thing I know... boom. What do you think happened? No idea. We should get you to a doctor. No. No, no, no, I'm... I'm fine, I'm just tired and nauseous. Nausea. Fatigue. Craving that weird peanut butter sandwich. What? What if you're pregnant? Not a chance. How do you know? Because I know. Well, if that is the case, you should know, I'd make a great dad. Double the role models. Ofe, I'm not pregnant. Seriously. People don't just get dizzy and faint out of nowhere, though, so it has to be... I think that it was just a weird reaction to the study buddies I took. It's no big deal. You took something? Yeah, before I came here. Why? Why do you think? Well, I have no idea. Since when did you start using? Since what's the difference? Where'd you get it? It really doesn't matter. It does. There are some seriously bad pills out there, all right? And I really think we should take you to a doctor... The pills were fine. And how do you know that? Because I do. Okay, but how? Because they were yours! You stole my stash? You can get more anytime you want. I know, but that's not the point. Why didn't you just ask me? Because if I had asked you, you would have said no. Right, because you don't need them. How do you know what I need? Well, Taylor, this is not you. What do you even know about me? You're not my boyfriend. Clearly not. Uncle Shay has an alias for every day of the week. I just found three more. I guess if I made a living out of identity theft  and gun and drug trafficking, I would, too. Do we have enough for a warrant? I think so. Kid really came through, huh? I guess I was wrong about him. I guess we'll see. Is everything okay? Listen, I can't talk right now. I'll call you back later. (Dial tone) (Sighing) Do you really think he would try and hurt you, Crash? He's not the type to make empty threats, believe me. Okay, well, he can't touch you from jail. He has people, Carter. As soon as he finds out I talked, they'll come for me. Okay, well then, we need to talk to the police. And tell them you need some kind of protection. I might need protection from the cops, too. Why? They could still say I was part of Shay's operation. But you had nothing to do with it. With a past like mine, you really think a judge is gonna believe me? Come on. Even you didn't. So what are you gonna do? ♪♪ I think I have to leave. What, like leave town? Shay tracked me to your house. I stay anywhere around here and he can find me. Where would you go? Not sure yet. Alone? I'll be okay. How, Crash? By sleeping in your truck? You don't have anywhere to go. You don't have a job, you don't have anything. Hey, I could always go back to doing what I do best. And the benefits aren't great, but it pays well. That's not funny. I know. Maybe Shay is right. People like me don't get to decide our futures. I don't believe that for a second. Carter. Crash. Do you really think I don't get having absolutely no idea what comes next? For the past year, my entire life has been one new future after the other. I know. But I figure it out. Because people like us always do that. And you know what? We are going to figure this out together. ♪ Will I get over you? ♪

Me too. Reminds me what a great team we once were. Feels like a long time ago. It does, but if we focus on it... Remember what we had. Well, the problem is... It's not the only thing that I remember. There's so much pain, even when I think about the good times. It just... Brings me to someplace terrible. You. Lori and losing Carter. It's not over for me. I don't think it ever will be.

Didn't know we had company. Perfect. We'll start with beer. Then we'll be in the clear. That's how the saying goes, right? What's the occasion? Taylor fainted today. She popped some study buddies. Taylor fainted from pills? Yeah, so we needed a drink to process. I thought we were working on not blurting things out. Right. And... so how was your day, Max? No, no, no, you tell me what the hell happened. Look, Max, she got dizzy, all right? It's not a big deal. Okay, where is she now? She's at home now, she's okay. She fainted from pills that you gave her, clearly, she's not okay. Well, I didn't give her the pills, Max. I didn't even know she was taking them. How the hell is that even possible? You're a prescription drug dealer. I've been asking myself that all night. You know what, man? If you're gonna get the benefits, maybe try being a friend, too. Hey, Carter? Crash? ♪♪ Sorry to drop by unannounced. You sent me like 20 texts. It wasn't exactly unannounced. Well, you didn't answer. Because I didn't want to be lectured, and I still don't. I'm not here to lecture you. Oh. Thanks. My dad's here, so we can't exactly... I'm not here to not study with you. In fact, whatever it is we've been doing has been great, Tay, but I can't anymore. But... I'm sorry, isn't that a little hypocritical of you? You're a drug dealer and you're ending things because I took some pills? I'm ending things because I think you might break my heart. I don't understand. I see people using all the time. I know every effect the drugs have. I know when people are on pills. But? But I didn't know you were. So what? So I had blinders on. And the only explanation for why... I care about you too much. Okay, but I care about you, too. You're not falling in love with me. And since I... I think you still have feelings for Max, and I know he has them for you... I think it's time I opened my eyes. No, you're wrong. Max doesn't have feelings for me. But you do, for him. Hey, look.
