 Carter : Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 It's about Lori. 
 She tried to kill herself. 
 Have you talked to her? 
 No, and I'm not going to. 
 I mean, she could have died and you're acting like you wouldn't have even cared. 
 Lori, she sent me here. 
 I thought you came because your parents kicked you out. 
 I think she was just trying to get me to lure Carter away from the Wilsons. 
 I think that's maybe something that Carter should know. 
 Taylor : I'm just wondering why you never told me about what happened to your mom. 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it wasn't because I didn't trust you. 
 I don't want you to think that. 
 No, I don't. 
 Carter : I think I'd like to see her. 
 Max : Are you sure this is what you want? 
 That woman raised me. 
 If she had actually killed herself and I had never seen her again, I just know I would spend the rest of my life wondering why on earth I didn't at least try and help her. 
 You shouldn't have come. 
 Well, I wanted to. 
 You need to leave, Carter. 
 No, I'm not gonna leave. 
 I need to be alone, go away. 
 I love you. 
 Tell me you love me more. 
 She said she loved me. 
 She said I was her mom. 
 (crying) 
 Hey. 
 Come here. 
 Come on, come on. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Carter : How the hell could I have let this happen? 
 Max : You didn't let it happen, it just happened. 
 God, I hate myself. 
 We should talk about this. 
 Can we please just forget about it? 
 You needed me and I wasn't there. 
 Taylor, it's fine. 
 Girl code. 
 Except sister code, and I broke it. 
 If you ever need to talk, you know I'm here. 
 I don't think I've ever felt as bad about anything. 
 Like sick-to-my-stomach bad. 
 I didn't mean to hurt you. 
 The whole situation was just messed up, and if I could take it back, I would. 
 So I hope that this doesn't ruin everything between us. 
 I can't do this, I really do feel sick. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Like I want to be honest with her, but at the same time, I don't know if it's worth how much it might hurt her. 
 Max, the longer we wait, the worse it is going to be.

 Uh, special delivery for David and Elizabeth Wilson. 
 Can you sign for it? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Morning, sweetie. 
 Hi. 
 What's that? 
 Oh, nothing, just your divorce papers. 
 Have a nice day. 
 Hang on. 
 Sit down. 
 No, these are not divorce papers. 
 No, they're financial papers that we need to fill out as part of our separation agreement. 
 Which is usually what comes before a divorce. 
 Guys, if this is gonna happen, you should just tell us. 
 If we decide to get a divorce, you'll be the first to know. 
 Yes. 
 But the last thing that your father and I want is for you two to be stressed about this. 
 Oh, right. 
 Yeah, Wilson Family 2.0. 
 Less stress. 
 So just because two people are getting separated doesn't mean they're getting a divorce. 
 Correct. 
 Why don't you let us worry about the details and you just focus on you, okay? 
 The parents will take care of it. 
 Okay, well, I'm going to Peter Cho's house to play laser tag. 
 See you when I get back from college. 
 Did you ask the lawyers to file? 
 They called. 
 The separation agreement isn't valid unless they file. 
 That would've been nice if you had given me a heads-up. 
 David... 
 I'd just like to be included. 
 I'd appreciate that. 
 ♪ 
 Everything okay? 
 (sighing) You know. 
 Mom and Dad got their leading-up-to-divorce papers today. 
 Oh, God, really? 
 Yep. 
 Welcome to the Wilson Family Redux, where we're all happy because our parents finally decided what they're gonna do with their marriage. 
 Oh, God. 
 I need a break. 
 This family drama is too much. 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ 
 We should go to Gammy's cabin for the weekend. 
 Ooh. 
 I like that. 
 What do you think about inviting Max? 
 I just feel like it'd be a good time to catch up or... 
 That's actually a really good idea. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you want me to go ask him? 
 He's just downstairs working on his truck. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I'll do it.

 Go ahead. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 No, it's cool. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Uh, we just haven't really talked since you told me about your mom and I... 
 I'm glad we talked about that, I just... 
 There's been a lot going on since. 
 I know. 
 Um, I just feel really out of touch and I would like to be back in touch. 
 Me too. 
 I was actually thinking that maybe you and I could do something this weekend. 
 I was thinking the same thing. 
 Yeah? 
 The new "Insidious" is opening. 
 Oh, cool. 
 That would be more fun with like a group of us, though. 
 Carter and I were talking about going up to our grandparents' cabin for a few days... if you want to come. 
 I didn't know they had a cabin. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, it's more Buddy's. 
 I think he goes there to get away from Gammy. 
 But it'd be really fun. 
 You should come. 
 Does Carter know that you're inviting me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, she's into it. 
 I think that could be cool. 
 Okay. 
 Got everything? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 What is all that? 
 What? 
 I like to be prepared. 
 For what? The apocalypse? 
 They say it might rain. 
 Bird : Hey, hey. 
 You guys ready to hit the road? 
 What are you guys doing here? 
 We're escaping the rat race with you. 
 No, I didn't say anything. 
 I told Bird we were going. 
 And I invited Madison and Gabe. 
 And I told Damon. 
 And I said, "Cool, I'm in." 
 (laughing) 
 Come on, all the partying we've been doing at my place. 
 We needed a change of venue. 
 The more the merrier, am I right? 
 We brought movies. 
 "Insidious" one and two. 
 Nice. 
 Gabe : Party in the woods. 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 I was worried about you. 
 Oh, yeah, I'm fine. 
 You know what, though? I forgot something. 
 Max, could you help me, please? 
 We can't tell her with everyone else there. 
 Well, we'll just... we'll drive together and then we can talk to her, okay? 
 On the way? 
 I think we should just tell her. 
 Okay, and then what? 
 Expect her to just forget about it and want to party with everyone? 
 Hey. 
 You guys ready to go? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 Ready to roll. 
 Okay, I'll ride with Max. 
 Oh, I thought I might. 
 You just had a road trip with Max. 
 Damon : Tay, come with us. 
 We got a better stereo. 
 No offense, dude. 
 None taken. 
 So it's settled. 
 I'll ride with Max. 
 I'll see you guys there. 
 ♪ 
 You know, that's cool, those two driving together. 
 Maybe they'll patch things up. 
 Yeah, that would be good. 
 Max and Taylor? I'm behind. 
 Last I heard, Max and Taylor were way over and Ofe had it bad for Taylor. 
 He did, but, yeah, I think that's why he didn't want to hang out. 
 He's working his way through it. 
 I miss him. 
 The same. 
 It's gonna be great, though. 
 Taylor's cooking. 
 We brought the booze. 
 Haven't done the nature thing in a while. 
 How about you? 
 You big on the outdoors? 
 Have you met her? 
 I wouldn't classify myself as the outdoorsman per se. 
 Yeah. 
 Nature may be overrated. 
 Give me urban living any day. 
 Uh, you live in the suburbs.

 Taylor : She didn't really say much about it. 
 Was the hospital scary? 
 It was kind of depressing, but... 
 ... it wasn't the worst part. 
 What was? 
 When Carter when it, Lori told her to get out, then she said she never wanted to see her again. 
 I don't know why I'm even surprised. 
 And then on the way home, Carter was really upset. 
 I thought she was gonna lose it, so I... 
 I pulled over so that she could get some fresh air. 
 Really? 
 That's awful. 
 I feel like it's my fault. 
 No, not... Taylor... 
 You didn't do anything wrong. 
 No, I should've gone with her. 
 I don't care about Lori, but I wasn't there for Carter when she really needed me. 
 But at least she had you. 
 She wasn't totally alone. 
 You're a really good friend. 
 You know that, right? 
 I miss being with you. 
 Yeah, me too.

 Wow. 
 Rustic. 
 Yeah. 
 For the country club type, Grandpa Buddy's pretty earthy, huh? 
 Oh, um, there are only three bedrooms, so some of us are gonna have to share. 
 And also, me and Taylor have dibs on the upstairs. 
 Uh, Bird and I can bunk together. 
 Sounds good. 
 Let's go. 
 Honey, we're home. 
 Madison : I love this place. 
 I want to play hide-and-seek in here. 
 This is nice. 
 Oh, yeah, and the heating doesn't work very well in here, so we're probably gonna have to go outside and get some kindling from the barn. 
 I'll go do it. 
 Okay. 
 Look at you all Daniel Boone. 
 Who taught you how to build a fire? 
 Lori. 
 I guess when you're on the run as much as she is, you pick up some survival skills. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna go check out the gazebo. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Max told me what happened. 
 He did? 
 I wish you'd felt like you could tell me. 
 Okay, um, Taylor, we didn't... 
 I mean, I didn't even realize how hard it'd be to see her. 
 To see who? 
 Lori. 
 Oh, um... 
 Well, it wasn't exactly a picnic. 
 I should have come with you. 
 No, come on, Taylor. 
 You didn't know it was gonna be like that. 
 Well, that's nice of you to say, but I should have been there. 
 I'm your sister. 
 Taylor, stop apologizing. 
 You didn't do anything wrong. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 I'm really glad we're here. 
 (sighing) 
 ♪ 
 Here, put this over there. 
 It's a weekend in the woods, Bird, not a catalogue shoot. 
 Yeah, well, I appreciate rustic as much as the next girl, but this is a little too much. 
 I mean, knotty pine, really? 
 Something has to be done. 
 So, um... are you gonna talk to Carter about Lori? 
 Yeah. 
 When? 
 I don't know, soon. 
 Sorry, I... didn't mean to make you feel guilty. 
 Well, you did. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were so sensitive. 
 I am very sensitive, and you should watch out.

 So what's the deal with those two? 
 Got me. 
 Besties? 
 Frenemies? 
 Girl on girl? 
 You think they're together? 
 You got a thing for Bird, huh? 
 Maybe. 
 But hey, you know, if they're a thing, I don't... 
 I don't want to get in the middle. 
 Really? 
 The middle might be kinda nice. 
 Whatever. 
 Bird doesn't give me the time of day. 
 What is it with you and this defeatist attitude? 
 At the very least, you gotta get in there and see what's going on with those two. 
 Go on, get in there. 
 Suss it out. 
 Okay, sussing. 
 Yeah. 
 What's up with that? 
 So you guys up for these movies or what? 
 They're pretty scary. 
 I think we can handle it. 
 Yeah. 
 I've seen them, they're actually really good. 
 I know some girls are kinda... scared about the whole horror thing. 
 You mean the whole sexist punishment of the liberated female in the horror genre? 
 I just meant the gore. 
 I'm good with gore. 
 You? 
 I'm game. 
 You know, if... 
 I could hang out in your room if you get spooked, or sleep there. 
 That's so noble. 
 Thank you, Damon. 
 Yeah, you are... you are such a hero. 
 I feel like we're cool, though? 
 All right. 
 Well, offer's open. 
 Just saying. 
 I'm gonna go find Carter. 
 (doorbell ringing) 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Is David here? 
 I was supposed to meet him at his office, but I couldn't find him. 
 I figured he just must've already come home. 
 No, no, he's not home. 
 He said that he might work late. 
 Did you try to call him? 
 Yeah. 
 He... he didn't answer. 
 Well, that was before my phone started to die. 
 Shoot. 
 Okay, well, I'm just gonna head back to the school. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 Well, you can come in and wait, if you want. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 That would be great. 
 You're saving me from some major traffic. 
 Come in. 
 ♪ 
 Hey. 
 It's really beautiful out here, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 You remember when Lori used to let us camp out in the living room? 
 Yeah. 
 So... how'd it go when you saw her? 
 Not well. 
 I'm still kind of trying to process it. 
 What happened? 
 She told me she never wants to see me again. 
 There's no way she actually feels that way and you know that, right? 
 She obviously doesn't mean it. 
 Anyway, the whole trip was awful, not just because of Lori. 
 I kind of, um... got myself into a situation. 
 A bad situation. 
 And now I'm lying to someone that I really love about it. 
 Well, sometimes you have to lie. 
 To protect people, you know? 
 I mean, it's just the way life is. 
 Do you ever think that telling the truth could hurt more than lying about it would? 
 I think it all hurts the same. 
 Yeah, well, if it hurts all the same, I think I prefer to tell the truth. 
 What's stopping you? 
 Me... hating myself. 
 What this is gonna do to them. 
 What'd you do? 
 I slept with Max. 
 It's not like you were trying to hurt anybody. 
 You were in pain. 
 You guys love each other. 
 One thing led to another. 
 It's not like you want to be together. 
 No, of course not. 
 They're supposed to be together. 
 This is wrong on so many levels. 
 Now we're carrying around this awful thing behind Taylor's back. 
 It's not a totally black-and-white situation, Carter. 
 It's messy. 
 You know, people are messy and they sometimes don't tell the whole truth because... the whole truth is hard. 
 Well, what would you do? 
 Just keep lying and hope nobody found out? 
 You want me to pretend to be sick? 
 I can get everybody out of here, the three of you can just hash it out in nature. 
 No, you don't have to do that. 
 I don't want to ruin Taylor's whole weekend. 
 I just have to get through it and then I'll just tell her as soon as we get back. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, you have integrity, and I love you for it. 
 Really? 
 I don't feel like I have any integrity right now. 
 People do things, they do crazy things when they're vulnerable. 
 You know, they sometimes even do things that seem unforgivable, and then you put yourself in their shoes and you realize it's not. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 What are you guys doing? 
 It's cocktail hour. 
 We'll be right there. 
 You made a mistake. 
 Don't beat yourself up about it. 
 Oh. 
 You guys go ahead. 
 I think I'm just gonna hang out here for a while. 
 Okay, if we're gonna do cocktails, we need a playlist, but it has to be something woodsy. 
 Can you handle it? 
 Mad? 
 I couldn't tell her. 
 I tried. 
 Why not? 
 She has enough on her mind. 
 Okay, like what? 
 I can't say, but... she's in a bad situation and me telling her about Lori just would not have helped anything. 
 Okay, what kind of bad situation? 
 Something happened on her trip to go see Lori and... 
 I can't tell you. 
 Why not? 
 I can't. 
 Well, Max was there, right? 
 So I'll just ask him. 
 Don't. 
 Why not? It's gonna make things worse. 
 What things? 
 Okay, did something happen between them? 
 Did they get into a fight? 
 Oh. 
 Okay, I thought you were gonna say they robbed a bank or something. 
 What is she so worried about? 
 It's not like they cheated and Max and Taylor have already broken up. 
 Yeah, but Taylor's not gonna see it that way. 
 Well, it's not like it's something Max and Carter never did before. 
 Yeah, but that was before Taylor. 
 Damon : Hey! 
 What's the deal with the cocktails?

 David was absentminded long before he was a professor. 
 How so? 
 On our first date, he took me to a four-star restaurant. 
 And? 
 And he forgot his wallet. 
 And you had to pay? 
 Yes. 
 (chuckling) 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 He has a very sweet side. 
 You know, he used to say this thing. 
 You know when your necklace, the back of it is in front? 
 He would adjust it for me like this and he would say, "Make a wish." 
 Oh my God, it's probably getting late. 
 I should get out of your hair. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Well, it was great getting to know you. 
 Yeah, it was really fun hanging out. 
 I'm just gonna leave these here for David. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Madison knows? 
 I'm sorry, I had to talk to someone about it. 
 I was going crazy. 
 Maybe it's a good thing. 
 You know, tell her, get it out there in the open, then we'll just deal with whatever happens. 
 So we're telling her? 
 First chance we get.

 He acts like they're together. 
 I mean, he's talking about moving in with her. 
 Well, that's kind of a big deal. 
 Yeah, but from the vibe that I'm getting, not gonna happen. 
 I feel like he's gonna get his heart stomped and there's nothing I can do but watch. 
 Wait, are the Wilsons getting back together? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm gonna talk to Taylor about it. 
 I wouldn't do that right now. 
 Why not? 
 Um... she just has a lot going on. 
 What do you mean? 
 I just mean I don't think it's a good time to talk to her. 
 Based on wt? 
 Based on recent information. 
 What recent information? 
 What are we talking about? 
 I'm not quite sure. 
 Something about Taylor. 
 What about her? 
 I don't know. 
 Recent information. 
 Recent? How recent? 
 We just got here. 
 Yeah, she was fine before we drove up. 
 Okay, she was fine before but now she's not. 
 What changed? 
 What changed must have been the drive up, with Max. 
 Is it something to do with her and Max? 
 Guys, she's fine. 
 Give it a rest It's not even about her. 
 But it's about Max. 
 If it's not about Max and Taylor, it must be about Max and someone else? 
 I didn't say that. 
 Who? Max and who? 
 Hey. 
 We gonna watch these movies or what? 
 Where is everyone else? 
 Taylor deserves to know now. 
 Where is she? 
 Shh. 
 She's in the kitchen. 
 You need to calm down and stop being so selfish. 
 It's not about me. 
 I care about her and I don't want her hurt. 
 I agree, except telling her will also hurt. 
 Listen, this is none of our business. 
 It's gone way too far and we can't get involved. 
 It's supposed to be a secret. 
 Whatever you want to call it, it's a lie and lies suck and they always come out. 
 They don't have to. 
 It feels like she should know, but right here, now? 
 It could be pretty humiliating. 
 What's humiliating is that everyone knows but her. 
 Why are you getting so hysterical? 
 I'm not getting hysterical. 
 If someone cheated on someone you loved, you'd be cool with it? 
 I wouldn't be cool with it but I also wouldn't want to be the one to tell, either. 
 Good, so we keep it a secret and let them work it out. 
 No. 
 I'm not gonna be a part of some big lie. 
 It's disrespectful to Taylor. 
 So you're gonna tell her?

Are you hearing yourself? She kidnapped me again because she loved me? Threatened my entire family because she loved me? Carter... Have you been talking to her this whole time, Madison? Carter, I didn't know who else to go to. I'm telling you this now because I thought that you would understand. I was desperate. The same way that you were desperate when you did that thing with Max.

I know. But I just wanted to talk about it... because being with him... ... made me realize how much I miss you. And... ... what we have is... It's pretty incredible. Yeah, it is. I mean, think about all the things that we've been through together. More than most people. I don't feel like myself when I'm not with you. Same for me. So you're not mad about Ofe? No, I'm definitely not mad. Not even a little? No. Well, I'm sorry anyway. I wish it had been different. It's all in the past. And like I said, we were broken up. Okay. I've been honest with you. It's your turn. Okay. Did you sleep with Bird? What? I mean, it's okay. You can tell me. I know you guys were living together and I saw you at that party. Taylor, I didn't sleep with Bird. Ever? Ever. You promise? I promise you. Oh... Oh, God. I was so nervous to ask you, but I'm really glad that I did. I mean, I know that we've been broken up and everything, but... If you had slept with her, I... I'm not gonna lie, I'd be upset. You know how I am. You know how long it took me to forgive Crash. I don't know, I... I have some things to work on.

I kept my mouth shut. One less strong. Gabe snores. Damon wets the bed. I don't wet the bed. Good morning. Bird : Hey. Damon : Good morning. You guys wanna pack up, hit the road? Don't see why not. Let's go, let's go. What happened? Nothing. Does she want to get back together? Yeah, I think so. (Sighing) I can't be with her until she knows the truth. God, I don't even know if it would be more selfish at this point to tell her. Madison told me some stuff last night that I really wish I didn't know. Like what? It's not important. Taylor is gonna need to know the truth. I really hope you're right. ♪ Silver and gold ♪ Anything we need to look at again? No, no. It seems in order. Oh, your necklace. What about it?
