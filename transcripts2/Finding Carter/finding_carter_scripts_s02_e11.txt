 Previously on Finding Carter... 
 Max : You were going through something that was really difficult. 
 Carter : No. 
 Don't make excuses for me. 
 You love Taylor, Max. 
 I know she loves you, too, and I put myself first again. 
 I miss you every day and what we have is pretty incredible. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Taylor : I think we're gonna work things out. 
 That's really great. 
 I can't be with her until she knows the truth. 
 I really hope you're right. 
 What is Carter's necklace doing in here? 
 ♪ 
 Max? 
 Hey. 
 Where'd you find that? 
 It was in the back of Max's truck. 
 What was it doing there? 
 Taylor, we have to tell you something. 
 What? 
 What's wrong? 
 When we went to go visit Lori... 
 Max and I slept together. 
 You're kidding, right? 
 Please tell me you're kidding.

 Carter : Taylor, wait. 
 Taylor, stop running. 
 Let us explain. 
 Look, we made a mistake. 
 A mistake?! 
 Taylor, it was all my fault. 
 I promise, it wasn't him. 
 No, no, no, it was both of our faults, and if we could take it back, we would. 
 Well, you can't! 
 Yeah, we know that, Taylor. 
 Tay, I'm so sorry. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 Oh no. 
 I'm sorry you guys feel so bad. 
 But I can assure you that I feel much worse. 
 ♪ 
 This feels good. 
 Yeah. 
 I missed you. 
 Ah, I remember that. 
 So, um, I guess I'm gonna have to give you your sock drawer back. 
 Right? 
 Yes. 
 How is this gonna work? 
 When do we tell the kids? 
 Well, there's a couple of grownups we should probably talk to first. 
 Yes, of course. 
 Is it gonna be a problem with Hillary? 
 You guys have to teach together. 
 You and Kyle have to work together. 
 Touché. 
 (cell phone dinging) 
 Ooh. 
 SAT scores? 
 You had it on your calendar, too? 
 Of course I did. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But did you remember to make the dinner reservations? 
 Oh... 
 Of course I did. 
 I don't understand how you could let this happen. 
 It's not something that we planned. 
 It was just a really bad moment. 
 And you just thought, we're broken up... 
 So it's okay? 
 It's fine, we can do this? 
 No, that's not what happened at all. 
 And what about you? 
 Did you think this was okay? 
 You're my sister. 
 We should have stepped back. 
 We should have stopped. 
 You think? 
 (sighing) 
 Okay, look, Taylor, I'm not gonna sit here and try and explain this away, but... 
 No, I can explain. 
 Other people's feelings do not register with you. 
 Of course your feelings matter to me, Taylor. 
 Please tell me what I can do to fix this, please? 
 There's nothing either of you can do. 
 But if I think of something, I'll be sure to let you know. 
 Hey. 
 Welcome back, how was the trip? 
 How was the cabin? 
 Um, it was... it was good, it was good. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Are you okay? 
 What's wrong with this picture? 
 Just... just tired. 
 Your father and I thought a getaway would help. 
 Taylor : Help what? 
 Well, just how hard it was when Carter went to see Lori. 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 But anyway, let's not talk about her. 
 Do you guys remember what today is? 
 The SAT scores. 
 Oh, now? 
 Yes, come on! 
 I'm gonna let you guys get to that. 
 Elizabeth : Max, stay. 
 Can you convince him to stay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, stay.

 Congratulations, Tay. Taylor, that is amazing. 
 It's okay. 
 Honey, the best score you can get is 2,400. 
 This is great. 
 Oh, Carter, let's look. 
 1,600. 
 Average. 
 Hey, nothing about you is average. 
 Sweetie, under the circumstances, that is incredible. 
 Yes. 
 Seriously. 
 And if you wanna retake it, you can. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 Meanwhile, we are going to celebrate, as a family, at the Italian Oven. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, I can't, I can't. 
 Wait a minute, we've been planning this for weeks, we told you. 
 Yeah, come on. 
 The pressure is finally off you guys. 
 Family dinner. 
 And, Max, we would love for you to join us. 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 I still have so many applications to do for internships and the sooner I figure out what I'm doing this summer, the happier I'll be. 
 David : Taylor, you guys got through the test, we are going to celebrate. 
 Uh... okay. 
 Yeah, dinner. 
 (sniffling) 
 (knocking) 
 (door creaking) 
 Taylor, I know nothing I could say right now is gonna make this better. 
 I don't want you to have to put on a happy face for dinner. 
 I'm just gonna tell them I'm not feeling well. 
 It's fine. 
 Taylor, please let me explain what happened. 
 Carter, the last thing I want to hear is what happened between you and the first... 
 ... and only person I've ever loved. 
 Okay.

 Yeah, I understand.

 Impressive. 
 So what's next, a run for Congress? 
 Uh, I don't think they'll let me run with my record. 
 David : Oh, sure they will. 
 I think it's a requirement. 
 Elizabeth : Well, we're glad that you're here. 
 You done with basic? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, next I'll find out where I'm posted and then I'll get to pick a specialty. 
 Oh, what are you interested in? 
 Well, actually, there's a program at Fort Bragg where they teach you do to Special Forces stuff. 
 Crisis management, combat driving and tactical operations. 
 Oh, yeah, I can totally see you doing that. 
 Well, you gotta love irony.

 (chuckling) 
 Taylor got a perfect score on her SATs. 
 Uh, almost perfect. 
 Carter likes to exaggerate. 
 It's one of her many character flaws. 
 Congratulations, Taylor. 
 Thank you, Crash. 
 You too. 
 Uh, Taylor, Crash is gonna come to dinner with us. 
 Is that okay? 
 Why not? 
 The more the merrier. 
 What's up with her? 
 Um, she's mad at me. 
 Wanna talk about it? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I really do. 
 But you know what? 
 Let's, um... let's have dinner first. 
 Sounds good. 
 Hey, where are you staying? 
 Do you need to stay here? 
 No, I got a hotel room in town. 
 Crash, you could have stayed here. 
 I didn't want to presume anything. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I have to get ready. 
 Okay, how about I come back in an hour and pick you up? 
 We'll ride to dinner together like we're on a date. 
 That sounds good. 
 Cool. 
 Detective Wilson? 
 Elizabeth. 
 Um, I'm just on my way out. 
 Aren't you coming to dinner with us? 
 Yeah, of course, I just wanted to... 
 I just wanted to ask you something. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Did the cops ever nab my uncle? 
 No, did he try to contact you? 
 No, no, he doesn't know I enlisted, so he wouldn't have any way of finding me. 
 Good. 
 Um, no. 
 Word is that he left the state and he's setting up shop in North Carolina, but don't worry. 
 We're gonna get him. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Great, I'll be back in a little bit to pick up Carter. 
 Yeah, see you later. 
 See you, Mr. Wilson. 
 See ya. 
 Hey, ooh, I'm glad I caught you. 
 Um, I'm gonna just have to meet you at the restaurant, if that's okay. 
 Why? 
 Well, when we planned the dinner, I invited Gabe and Kyle and I need to tell him what's going on. 
 Can't you call him? Might be easier. 
 I just think that it's best if I just do it face to face. 
 Wish me luck. 
 Good luck. 
 Are you gonna tell Crash? 
 Yeah, of course I'm gonna tell him. 
 Just need to find the right time. 
 Good luck with that.

 What do you mean? 
 I have to get to dinner. 
 I thought we were going together. 
 Kyle, I have to change our plans.

 Can you rewind it, please? 
 Man : Yeah. 
 Yes... okay. 
 That's them walking out, but I can't see the car. 
 Well, there's... there's another camera on the other side. 
 Yeah, will you go to it, please? 
 There, there. 
 That's... that's what the... the car they drove up in, I think. 
 I'll call it in. 
 Just rewind it a little bit further. 
 You're gonna have to give me a copy of this. 
 I need a trace, Victor, Bravo, Frank, 4-1-4-0, Indy.

 Great. 
 Thank you for your help. 
 Yeah.

 All units, I need an APB. for a red Mazda, Maryland plates, Victor, Bravo, Frank, 41-40. 
 We're looking for three white males, one early 20s, two early 30s. 
 Assume that they're armed and dangerous. 
 Yes. 
 Yes, what? 
 Yes, to the new beginning thing. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 What for? 
 Well, if I hadn't have told Crash about you and Max, maybe he wouldn't have gone to the motel. 
 No, Taylor, don't be ridiculous. 
 They were following him, they would have found him anyway. 
 Okay, well, I'm still sorry. 
 I thought it would somehow even the score, but it didn't. 
 Look, Taylor, you have every right to be angry. 
 It's just human instinct to lash out when someone hurts you. 
 I've done it tons of times. 
 It's also human to seek comfort when you're in trouble. 
 People can hurt each other, but they can still love each other. 
 Think about Mom and Dad. 
 To new beginnings. 
 To new beginnings. 
 (police radio chatter) 
 How are you? 
 I'm fine. 
 I requested a transfer this morning. 
 Where? 
 I don't know yet. 
 Listen, Kyle, I know that you're angry with me, but I am hoping one day that we'll be able to be friends. 
 We're not gonna be friends, Liz. 
 I told you from the beginning, I didn't know where my head was. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Let's just be honest here... you used that as an excuse. 
 You were scared and you didn't wanna face being alone, so you leaned on me, and that's what happened, and honestly, it's not my job to make you feel better about it anymore. 
 I can't be your friend, Liz. 
 I'm still in love with you. 
 I always will be.

 I was just doing what they taught me. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Crash, I'm sorry for what happened between me and Max. 
 You already said that. 
 I believe you. 
 Okay. 
 The base is only three hours away from here. 
 I was thinking you could drive down on weekends. 
 What? 
 Or I could come here. 
 And we can... 
 Skype, FaceTime, text, Instagram, Snapchat.
