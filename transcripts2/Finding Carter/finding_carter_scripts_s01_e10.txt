 Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 We know you've been sleeping with Gabe's dad. 
 If you don't divorce Elizabeth, then I will let you write your book. 
 So you'd already written it. 
 And that whole speech about fatherly truth-telling... 
 That was a lie. 
 Yes. 
 I need my bank to cover some debts. 
 You're his bank? 
 Here, don't say your bank didn't do anything for you. 
 What am I supposed to do with it? 
 Sell it, pawn it. 
 Are you sure you wanna do this? 
 It's your first time, I want it to be perfect. 
 I miss her. 
 I'll find her for you. 
 I believe you have a necklace of mine. 
 No, I don't. 
 But you're wearing my bracelet. 
 She gave this to me. 
 Did you give that to her? 
 Hands behind your back please. 
 Bird, tell them! 
 What... You... 
 Could you just tell me what this looks like? 
 It looks bad. 
 Did Crash put you up to this? 
 Between you and your husband, I... 
 I think I might actually be better off in here. 
 It seems my daughter stole my necklace and blamed your daughter. 
 I've dropped all charges against Carter. 
 I'm here to pick up Carter... 
 No, Liz, Crash came by. 
 Some idiot clerk allowed him to post bail for her. 
 She's gone? 
 (Elizabeth) She's gone.

 Whoo! 
 ♪ It must be fate... ♪ 
 Sit down. 
 Sit down and put your seatbelt on. 
 What... 
 All right, all right. 
 Pretty safety conscious for a fugitive. 
 I just got you. 
 I don't want to lose you now. 
 Out the window. 
 (Sighs) So where are we going? 
 I don't know. 
 Where do you want to go? 
 Away. 
 My favorite place. 
 Somewhere where nobody knows me... 
 Where nobody has any reason to lie to me. 
 So, California? 
 California? 
 Yeah, why not? 
 Land of the fresh start. 
 And I can be a farmer. 
 I've always wanted to be a farmer. 
 What? 
 No, no, you're right, that is exactly what I think when I look at you. 
 Cows. 
 Not cows. 
 A marijuana farmer. 
 Oh, my God, I'm so uncool. 
 Maybe, maybe... 
 Maybe even a marijuana farmer that's... 
 Seen the Grand Canyon. 
 The Grand Canyon? 
 Yeah, why not? 
 And maybe, like, also a farmer who's seen Mount Rushmore? 
 Okay, or... 
 A marijuana farmer that's seen where you grew up. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah.

 Ugh! 
 (Phone beeps) 
 (Sighs) 
 Any news? 
 No, her phone is off, her voice-mail is full, and the tracker that we put on her phone says she was in North Carolina. 
 Now it says that they're doubling back. 
 So, maybe she's headed home. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 You know, I wish, for once, that I could just live in your world. 
 Just nice and relaxed, hope everything's gonna be okay, but I can't do that. 
 I can't just cross my fingers and hope that she's okay and nothing bad is going to happen. 
 Lizzie, I'm just saying it's too early to get hysterical. 
 I'm not hysterical... David. 
 I am proactive. 
 I know this is frightening. 
 We lost her once before. 
 I see myself in her. 
 And if I was her... 
 I wouldn't come back. 
 You'd have had good reason. 
 That mother of yours... 
 Are you saying that I'm like my mother? 
 I'm reminding you that you're not. 
 Yeah, I know, I just... 
 Look, please don't tell her I called. 
 When are you coming home? 
 I don't know about home, but I really want to see you guys. 
 But you could come home. 
 Bird and her mom came by the house. 
 Oh, yeah? What did she say? 
 She said that she stole all the jewelry, not you. 
 They dropped all charges against you. 
 What? 
 You're not in any trouble. 
 Yeah, please come home. 
 (Sighs) I can't, I... 
 It's not safe for Crash now. 
 (Elizabeth) Carter, it'll never be safe for Crash. 
 Just come home, you're not in trouble. 
 Listen to me, he's only going to make things worse for you. 
 Sorry, she just barged in. 
 I'm sorry, I'm leaving. 
 I'm... I'm leaving right now. 
 Is she still there? 
 Come... 
 (Sighs) 
 No, she left. 
 Right. 
 Where are you guys going? 
 Um, Disneyland of course. 
 Yeah, that's where I would go, too. 
 I'll talk to you later, Armadillo. 
 You too, Elephant. 
 Bye. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Are you ready? 
 Yeah. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 (Camera shutter clicks) ♪ Jumping up for you you need a little boost ♪ (Carter) Okay, what's your favorite sound? I'm not gonna tell you. Come on! Okay, all right. A train... in the distance. Like, at night. I told you it was stupid. That's not stupid, that's really nice. What's yours? My favorite sound... The sounds that dogs make... When you haven't seen them for awhile and you come back and they're really excited to see you. (Imitating dog whimpering) I know what you're talking about. If I went away for a long time and then I came back, would you make that sound? Yes. (Phone alert chimes) (Beeps) Oh, my God. What? Crash, pull over. What? Pull over. Elizabeth put out an amber alert? I'm sorry. (Sighs) Damn it! (Alert chimes) (Taylor) Mom, an amber alert? How could you? If not now, I hope eventually you understand why I had to do this. Isn't this for kidnappings? Yes. So, you're saying Crash kidnapped Carter. But she sounded fine on the phone. I hope what you just did works. How's that? Yeah, it's good. Ah, well... The B's not great. No... Now it kind of looks like the "B" is bigger than all the other letters. God, that's horrible. No, it's fine, look, nobody's even gonna be looking. We can just go. Carter, will you just let me do this? (Distant train whistle blows) Hold the light still. There you go, much better. Come on, we can go. There's a few things we have to figure out first. Where are we? Like, 30 Miles outside of York. Okay, so the closest bus terminal would be... Harrisburg, right? Why do we need a bus terminal? 'Cause you're going home. What, no I'm not. Carter, this isn't a game anymore. Why don't you get that? It's a manhunt. If they catch me, they're gonna charge me with statutory rape and kidnapping. Yeah, except you didn't rape me, you didn't kidnap me! Yeah, but you're... you're a minor! In the eyes of the law, I did. You're better off without me, come on. No, I'm not! All right, well, then I'm better off without you. Are you? No. (Phone buzzing) No, but we'd both be better off without this. All right, fine, I'll turn it off. It doesn't matter if it's off or on, it's a GPS system pointing right to us. All right, fine. There, is that better? Are we doing this? Well, clearly I am. Are you? (Phone thuds) It's just us. We're off the grid. Yeah. (Distant train whistle blows) ♪ So, there were two of them in the aisle, and I didn't understand, they were really excited 'cause they just got their black tip on their belt. And I appreciate that 'cause I was a purple belt. Yeah. But when they started throwing the moon-pies and I ask them to stop, then they look at me like, "hey, man, do you kung fu?" And so I said, "do you think that's air you're breathing?" Thanks for making me laugh. You know what else I was thinking? What? (Chuckles) Is this for me? Mm-Hmm. So, I can... I can come here all the time whenever I want. All the time, whenever you want. And we can lay on the couch. Mm-Hmm. I'll cook you food. Ramen. I wish I could call Carter and tell her about it. Trust me, she'll be back soon. (Door shuts) Hey. Hey. They never fixed the lock on the back window. Hey, this could work. This is good, we could use this. Yeah, we could probably stay here until we find a new spot. Is it weird being back? Yeah. This is really different without all our furniture. Okay, tell me. What was over here? Over here? Uh-huh. Um, over there was this big, old couch that we had that we bought at a flew market. All of our furniture was from flea markets. Okay, what about in front of the window? Uh... oh, that was where we, um, we put the Christmas tree every year. 'Cause my mom always wanted the neighbors to be able to see it when they walked past. Okay, what about here? Over here was our dining room. That... it was just where my mom kept all of her books. And, um, she had these three wicker baskets full of yarn right over there. She would always try to teach me how to knit. Wait, you know how to knit? No, I still can't do it. Oh, and my height chart! Look. Your what? You never had a height chart? You know, when your mom, like, makes you stand up against the wall and then, like, measures your height, and you can see how much you grow? No? Sorry. Oh! All right, well, let's do it now. Stand up against the wall. (Laughs) I'm sorry. Okay, move back. I can't even reach. Come back. So, that's you now, and the last time my mom measured me, I was here. What? This is new. This wasn't here before. My mom wrote this. Well, how do you know? That's her handwriting. That's how she does her sevens. Okay, what is it? I don't know, but I'm gonna write it down. (Muttering) Hey... What did I tell you? I told you I'd find her for you. (Footsteps approaching) (Door knocking) (Man) Hey, who's in there? Come on, I heard somebody in there last night. What do we say? Shh, shh, shh. All right, that's it. Let's go, let's go. I'm calling the landlord and the cops. ♪

 Wait. Everybody is looking for us. My mom would've seen the amber alert. She's met you, she'll know you didn't kidnap me. We need to go leave a message for her with Max. No, no. Yes, please, yes. No, no we can't even go in that direction. It's dangerous. What direction is good right now? We wont even stay long, and then after that I promise I will leave all navigation up to you. Please? Come on. Please, please? Okay. And then... California. Fine. Thank you. ♪ This is real ♪ 
♪ We're on fire ♪ All right, what do you want? Chips. Okay, I have, uh... Two dollars. What do you got? (Grunts) I thought you had money. I did. And then I paid your bail. And, uh... I bought something. What'd you buy? Are you kidding? Why did you buy that?! Carter, I have a record. Cops don't protect a guy like me. Now, look, we're both on the run. I want to be able to take care of us. I want to be able to protect you. You should learn how to use this. Safety's on. Wow, I guess I did learn something from Elizabeth. Hey, it's Elizabeth... detective Wilson. I'm just checking in again. Yeah, I... no, I appreciate it, it's just... I just want to remind you that's it's within the 48 hours, and after that, our chances decrease significantly. Right, right. No, I appreciate all the time you guys have put in tonight. Hey, I was wondering if that one lead turned out. Right, no, I get it. I just want them to come home. Yeah, you just let me know. I'll have my phone on me. Thanks. (Phone beeps) It's weird, right? Yeah. It's like classic mom again. Looking for the kid who isn't here. I like it when you're around. (Hushed) Come on. Carter. (Sighs) ♪ Sleazy heart don't make me pay ♪ I can't believe she did this. Try not to think about it. I'll help you forget. It's my turn. I'm going on a trip. You are? Yeah. I'm gonna take an ashtray, a boxer, uh... A caterpillar... Mm-Hmm. And a dart... You can't take this long, it's cheating. And... are you kidding me? I'm going as fast as I can. Okay, if I were to go on this trip, I would bring an apple, no... (Gasps) Ha ha! No! I won! I won! (Carter) This won't take long, I promise. (Car shuts off) (Door chimes) (Giggling) Oh, yeah! I knew you'd come back! Come here. I'm not really back. What're you talking about? I'm looking right at you. It's really good to see you. Sss... You're still with Crash. Come on, don't start. I didn't start. You know what, I think that's really what the problem is, is that I didn't start when I had the chance. (Phone dialing) Who are you calling? Taylor. Max, hang up. Hang up or I have to leave now. And you'll never see me again. (Phone beeps) Thank you. Now, turn it off. Why?! Because Taylor's gonna call back, and I know you, you can't keep a secret. Turn it off. You're not a very nice fugitive. Max... This is hard for me, too. (Strumming fingers) (Hushed) Come on, let's go, let's go. Look, why don't you want to see Taylor? Or Grant? You know, I could call them right now and they'd be here super fast. I can't stay that long. Okay, okay, well, at least talk to them. Carter, come on, when are you gonna realize you got... you got people here who really love you? No, I... Look, I need you to do me a favor. ♪ Will you give that to her if you see her? And I need two burner phones. Please, Max? (Max chuckles) Max, you don't understand, he's not like you. Okay, he's never had anyone care about him in his life, ever. No, I do understand that. And now, he just... He can't let people in. ♪ I'll make it super easy for you, okay? All right, I'll go out there and I'll tell Crash, be like, "hey, dude, she's decided to stay." He'll be like, "cool." (Chuckling) "All right, I get that." Okay, you want me to do that? Come on, I would love to do that. I can't stay, Max. I'll get you some burner phones. Come on, Max. (Groans) Have you heard from her? No. Maybe she's gone for good. If you're not careful, that's what you're about to be. You know, you gotta think about that apple falling far from the tree thing. She's not your tree. Come on, Max. Max, mind your own business, Max. (Whispering) Come on, Max. Why don't you like him? Seriously, what has he ever really done to hurt you? For starters, he's... he's taking you away. (Door opens, chimes) Hey. Hey, Max. How are you? Pretty good. Aren't you gonna ask me how I am? How are you, Crash? I think you know. Okay, well, I'm about done here. And I know you want to go, so let's just leave Max to his job... No, no, hold on. Give us one second. While I was sitting out there thinking, I had an idea. Thought of a way that you could help us. Max, you want to help us, right? Well, I mean, I know you want to help Carter. No, come on, look, he's done enough. Let's just leave him... Yeah, so he can do this one last thing. One last thing. (Sighs) This is easy. Give us everything in the register. Report it as a robbery. Dude, that's not happening. Just tell the cops you had a gun in your face. Get the hell out of my store. Yeah, I'm trying, I just... I just need the money. The money. Crash, what the hell are you doing? Carter, the safety's on. See... (Carter's voice echoing, distorted) What did you do? What did you do? Oh, my God. Oh, God. (Sobbing) You shot him. (Crash's voice echoing) I didn't mean to. Why? What did you do?! (Gasping for breath) Call 9-1-1! Carter, we have to go. (No audio) Why. I can't stay here, I have to go... Help me! No, I can't stay! No, we have to go, now! Help me! (Echoing) Help me! (Sobbing) (Phone dialing) (Dispatcher) 9-1-1, what's your emergency? My... My friend has been shot. Where was he shot?  He's not... Okay, an ambulance will be there shortly. There's so much blood! They're on their way, miss. What should... what should I do? I'm gonna stay with you til they get there. Okay. (Heart rate increasing) Max, blink if you can hear me. Max... Blink if you can hear me.
