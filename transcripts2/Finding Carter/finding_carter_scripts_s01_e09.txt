 Previously on Finding Carter... 
 Mom is having s*x with Gabe's dad. 
 That's not true. 
 It's true. 
 That is such a disturbing image. 
 We know you've been sleeping with Gabe's dad. 
 I've been having an affair. 
 No. No. No. 
 I've decided we're getting divorced. 
 I thought this was fixable. 
 If you don't divorce Elizabeth, and you are willing to work on things, then I will let you write your book "Finding Carter." 
 You were with him? 
 You overheard the whole conversation? 
 It was just David saying that you were staying and Lori should go and leave us alone. 
 That was it? Nothing about a meeting? 
 Thank you for arranging this meeting. 
 Is it possible... 
 She'd rather not see you than say good-bye? 
 Everything he told me was a... Oh, my God. 
 Carter, open the door. 
 (Knocking to the door) 
 Carter. 
 What's going on? 
 Go back to sleep. 
 Yeah, that's gonna happen. 
 All right. I'm coming in. 
 So am I. 
 Carter? 
 Carter! 
 (door shuts) 
 What's going on? 
 (scoffs) Carter. 
 ♪ There you go ♪ 
♪ There you stay ♪ 
♪ Keeping low ♪ 
♪ Never wanna play ♪ 
♪ You been up and down down ♪ 
♪ You been low low low ♪ 
♪ Pretending to not feel alone ♪ 
 
 Whatever it is, I want to help you with it. 
 Okay? 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 You know what? This is your dad. 
 Let me just tell him that you're on your way. 
 No, please. No, I can't 
 What did your dad do that has you so upset? 
 He took me to see my mom. 
 He took you to see Lori? 
 He said the two of them had a lovely phone conversation in which they discussed how difficult it must have been for me to make the decision to stay here with you guys and not run off with her. 
 He didn't. That's not true. 
 And we waited for almost three hours. 
 What? 
 Three hours in his car, sitting with him, and the whole time, he knew we were waiting for something that was never going to happen. 
 Well, you know, your dad, he does have flaws, but he is not cruel. 
 Really? That's not cruel? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I told him he could start writing his book. 
 You're letting him write "Finding Carter"? 
 Yeah. I wanted him to be happy. 
 Well, here's the thing about your dad, Carter. 
 He's not a liar. 
 He's not, he just... He hides things. 
 There's an explanation, and I'm gonna get it. 
 Okay? 
 All right. 
 Now we should go. 
 Can I drive your car? 
 Why? 
 Because I'm really sad, and I would really be cheered up by driving a really fast car with, like, sirens and stuff. 
 Oh, yeah. Nice try. 
 Come on. 
 So how are things at home? 
 My dad's a mess. 
 He's being strong, but I can see through it. 
 I wish there was something I could say to make it better. 
 I appreciate that. 
 What's up, guys? 
 Ofe, man, what happened? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wanna say, "You should see the other guy", but he looks great. 
 Not a scratch on him. 
 Who's the other guy? 
 Dude, you gotta press charges. 
 This is just the cost of doing business. 
 Got a customer, placed a big bet on a long shot and it paid off, and now I, uh, I owe him. 
 The only problem is I've been letting people pay me with their bar mitzvah savings bonds, so I'm low on cash. 
 Low as in "L", anybody seen Bird? 
 She's over there, talking with Ramon. 
 (French accent): The flavor of the week. 
 Bird! Yo! 
 I have a medical emergency. 
 Medical emergency. 
 Ugh. 
 This better be good. 
 What do you think? Good enough? 
 Yeah, what happened? 
 What happened is I need by bank to cover some debts. 
 Wait, you're his bank? 
 It's not a charity. She makes money. 
 I don't make money. 
 Yes, you do. 
 Enough to cover your... 
 Manis and pedis? 
 It's more an emotional investment than it is financial. 
 That's right. 
 She earns my undying gratitude, which is worth something. 
 Nobody say manis and pedis. 
 Ofe, this is a really bad time, okay? 
 My parents are back in town for the first time in eight months. 
 They're really happy to see me, but not so happy to see my credit card bills. 
 They're making me meet with their accountant. 
 That's your idea of a bad time? 
 Okay. Well, this is mine. 
 And next on this guy's list? My elbows, or kneecaps. 
 I get to choose which half of my body I want to lose the use of. 
 Ofe, you need to go to the police. 
 Yeah, seriously. 
 And what? 
 Hope they turn a blind eye to my illegal bookmaking operation? 
 Okay, I'll figure something out. 
 By tomorrow? 
 As soon as I can. 
 Hi. 
 Hey, Taylor. 
 What happened to you? 
 Nothing that prevents me from seeing how very alluring you look today. 
 Thanks. I'm flattered... and uncomfortable. 
 Um, can I have the car keys? 
 It's second period. 
 Can I please just have the car keys? 
 Are you skipping class? 
 Ooh... 
 Walk with me. 
 This is new. 
 Big deal. 
 I'm skipping school. I've done it before. 
 Here. Be safe. 
 Have fun. Come here. 
 Don't be nervous. It's gonna be great. 
 I've driven before. 
 I have a pretty good idea where you're going and what you're going to do. 
 I'm happy for you. 
 Seriously, Max is a really great guy. 
 You both really care about each other. 
 As usual, you're doing everything perfectly, including losing your virginity. 
 So don't worry about it. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 It has to be perfect. You only get one chance. 
 Do I look like I'm trying too hard? 
 No, you look really nice. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 You smell amazing today. 
 I was going to tell you earlier. 
 You like it? 
 Go. 
 Okay. 
 Next time you see me, I'll be a different person. 
 Totally changed. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're already totally changed. 
 I like it. 
 Okay. 
 See you. 
 Bye. 
 Mm. 
 Please tell me I'm smelling cookies and not some new air freshener. 
 These cookies are for Grant's bake sale at school, and those just came out of the oven. 
 I'm heaven right now. 
 You just got back from your editor? 
 How did it go? 
 Notes. 
 More notes. Endless notes. 
 This book will get published, and I'll still be getting notes. 
 Please tell me that I don't have to wait that long before I can read it. 
 Soon, I promise. 
 Okay, change of subject. 
 Why did you take Carter to see Lori? 
 Kind of an awful thing to do, don't you think? 
 It was awful. 
 I wanted her to feel that her decision to stay with us was the right one, and hopefully she'll never know it was a set-up. 
 What? 
 She knows. 
 What did you say? 
 I told her the truth about what we said to Lori the night we called. 
 I didn't know it was a thing. 
 I had to protect my family, so I got rid of Lori. 
 I spent the night convincing Carter that you weren't a liar, that you just have these weird secrets. 
 But this was a lie. 
 You want to talk about secrets and lies? 
 I gotta find Carter. 
 (school bell rings) 
 Carter. 
 I have to go. I have a science test. 
 I'll write you a note. 
 Can we talk?

♪ Your heart stops beating ♪ 
♪ Try and try to cry ♪ 
♪ But your tears are dry... ♪ 
 Thank you for hearing me out. 
 All I want is the truth. All right? 
 I don't care what that is. 
 I promise to give you that. 
 So you weren't like... like, punishing me for not letting you write your book? 
 No, I was trying to simplify your life. 
 I just thought maybe that would give you some closure. 
 My intentions were good, but my methods sucked ass. 
 Did I use that right? 
 Yeah, you used it right, just please never say it again. 
 About your book... 
 I was going to tell you that I changed my mind, and that you couldn't write it anymore. 
 Well, it's completely up to you. 
 All right... You can write it. 
 Thank you. 
 Can you hold off for a while? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 We'll start when you're ready. 
 Thank you.

 (easy pop music playing) 
 Are you sure... you wanna do this? 
 Yes. 
 You know, you can change your mind at any time. 
 I know. 
 The music okay? You like the music? 
 Don't be afraid to speak up. 
 If you don't like the way something feels. 
 Or if you want me to stop or adjust or... I can change... 
 Max... 
 Yeah. 
 This is starting to sound like Driver's Ed. 
 Sorry. 
 It's your first time, and I want it to be perfect. 
 Should we turn off the light? 
 Is that what you want? 
 Oh, I don't know. I just thought... 
 I want to do it however... 
 You think is the best way to do it. 
 Every way is the best way. 
 But it's your first time, so you should just be completely comfortable. 
 Um... okay, yeah. 
 Off, I guess. 
 Off? 
 Okay, I'll turn it off. All right. 
 I can't really see you. Could we turn the lamp on? 
 Not that lamp. 
 I found that lamp on the street, and I thought it was really cool, but it doesn't work. 
 Which is probably why I found it on the street. 
 There's a hardware store just a couple blocks away, so I'll run out and... 
 No, Max, you don't have to go... 
 No, this is your first time. 
 You should have a lamp. Yeah, okay. 
 Hello? 
 Ofe: I don't know what I'm going to do. 
 That looks pretty bad. 
 Give me a name. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Don't worry about it. It means nothing. 
 This was my mistake. 
 I got cocky, I started taking large bets. 
 I learned a valuable lesson. 
 Stay in your league. 
 Do you do that? 
 Do you beat people up? 
 I didn't say anything about beating anybody up. 
 I'm serious, Crash. 
 I'm not going to beat anybody up, okay? 
 Okay? Come on. 
 (easy pop music playing) 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know. 
 It's like... I'm nervous. 
 It's like, suddenly I don't know what to do. 
 I don't know what order to do this all. 
 Just so you know, I'm not saying I'm great, but usually, I'm better than this. 
 Why are you so nervous? 
 'Cause I'm your first. 
 And that's... that's a great honor. 
 I don't know what's going to come after me, and I don't want to think about those guys. 
 It's just... 
 Neither do I. 
 But it's like I already want to be better than them. 
 I want to be your first, but I also want to be your best. 
 You will be. I know you will be. 
 I'm already... I'm already terrible. 
 No, like, I went out and bought you a lamp. 
 That's just... I got... I got nervous. 
 Then I told you that I got nervous, and then after that, 
 I told you, like, the why I'm nervous. 
 I shouldn't have done that. 
 Now I realize that I'm telling you that I'm terrible. 
 But what I'm trying to say is I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 It's fine. It's fine. 
 We can do it another time. 
 Can we do it another time? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll see you. Okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right. I'll see you. 
 Hey, good-bye. 
 Here. 
 Don't say your bank didn't do anything for you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Bird... you shouldn't have. 
 I know 
 Bird where did you get that? 
 My mom's jewelry closet, and yes, I said closet. 
 It's not like she'll miss it. 
 What am I supposed to do with it? 
 Sell it, pawn it, pay off your debt. 
 Me in a pawn shop with this necklace? 
 I don't have the right shoes. 
 Give it to me. 
 Yeah, I know a few places. I'll take care of it. 
 No, Crash, you can't get involved with this. 
 It's not like it's stolen. It's mine. 
 Eventually. 
 Are you worried about me? 
 Yes. 
 This is the first time anybody's ever been worried about me. 
 Which means I get to say don't worry. 
 Okay? 
 This is simple. 
 Crash. 
 I love you. 
 Um, hello? 
 I love you too. I could never repay you. 
 It's a figure of speech. I'll repay you. 
 Hello? 
 So? 
 How'd it go? 
 Oh, what happened? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing? 
 He said he was nervous, and then he was getting all competitive with the boyfriends that I don't even want because I have him. 
 All right. 
 So today didn't count. 
 You'll try again, it's no big deal. 
 I'm not sure he wants to. 
 Taylor, come on. He wants to. 
 He really likes you. 
 Like, really, really, really likes you, Taylor. 
 I really, really, really, really like him. 
 Just so you know, when you reach six "reallys," 
 you're technical supposed to switch over to "love". 
 And you're only two away. 
 (knock on door) 
 David: Come in. 
 Good luck trying to talk your way out of this one. 
 We've been fighting all night, I'm done. 
 Okay, so, uh... 
 I'll talk to Carter today. 
 How about this? 
 We'll talk to Carter together. 
 (knock on door) 
 Hey, sleepyhead. Time to get up. 
 Five more minutes. 
 Uh-uh. 
 You already had an extra hour. 
 
 
 
 Oh crap, I'm late. 
 Shh. No, no, no. 
 You're not going to school today. 
 Why? 
 How about we talk about that over breakfast, okay? 
 Okay. 
 So you'd already written it. 
 Yes. 
 And that whole speech about fatherly truth telling... 
 That was a lie? 
 Yes. 
 What are the red marks? 
 My editor made those. 
 Have you read this? 
 Just yesterday. 
 How was it going to work, exactly? 
 Were you just gonna pretend to talk it through with me, and then show me chapters that had already been written and edited? 
 I hadn't worked it out. 
 Carter, I needed this book. 
 For my family, for me. 
 I kept thinking it would all work out, but I was wrong. 
 I never would have published it without your permission. 
 I don't believe you. 
 "She had a tornado-like quality in our lives from day one". 
 "Within 24 hours of meeting her prim and proper twin sister", "Carter had gotten Taylor drunk and stoned," "and stolen her boyfriend." 
 See, and he knows that's not what happened. 
 Okay, he calls Max "a stoner with a slow tongue and an even slower brain." 
 How can anyone be mean about Max? 
 Yes! 
 They won. Oh, thank you, God. 
 Do you realize what this means? 
 I don't owe the money anymore. 
 The guy now owes me. 
 Call Crash. 
 It's just going straight to voice-mail. 
 I'm out of the hole. You don't seem happy for me. 
 What? Oh, yes. 
 Woman over intercom: Beatrix? 
 Beatrix, can you hear me? 
 (mouthing words) 
 Yes, Mom, I can hear you. 
 I need you in the house. 
 Okay. (beep) God forbid she actually come down here and meet my friends. It's been eight months. You'd think they'd be curious about my life. (Beep) Now, Beatrix. I'm coming. (Beep) Just hang here, okay? (easy pop music playing) (knocking on door) Taylor? (gasps) I'm sorry. This is... this is bad. No. No, it's not. I'm sorry to have to see me like this. I'm sorry about yesterday. I'm glad you're here. I like you like this. Should I change the music? No. No. I should brush my teeth. No. This isn't perfect. Yes, it is. I really like you. I really like you. I mean, I really, really... really... really, really like you. That's five. One more to go. And then what? Crash still isn't answering his phone. Woman on intercom: Hello? Yes? Carter Stevens? Is Carter Stevens there? She is. Yeah. Hi. Come up to the house please. Okay, I'll be right there. (intercom beeps) They won. You ain't breaking my legs, man. (police radio droning) Beatrix, this is the friend you referred to? Yes. What's going on? Carter, I'm Beatrix's mother. I believe you have a necklace of mine. Um, no, I don't. No? But you're wearing my bracelet. She gave this to me. Did you give that to her? No. Sorry, Carter. Hands behind your back, please. What? You're arresting me? Hands before your back, please. Carter Stevens, you're being charged with grand larceny. Bird, tell them. Come on. What are you... Where are the cookies I made? Mon, they sold out first thing. People loved them. Really? Yeah, Mom, you were the hit of the bake sale. Come here. Excuse me. Is this your phone? Oh yeah, thanks. We ask our parent volunteers to silence their phone. In hopes that you care enough about your child's school to give it two hours of your time. Of course. I am so sorry. Also your daughter's in jail. What? (Phone chimes) That was happening a lot. Mom, go. Yeah. Elizabeth, check your messages. Just get down here, okay? Now. It's about Carter. Kyle. David. Why don't you have the basic kindness to steer clear of our family issues? I'm actually doing you a favor. Your daughter doesn't have a lot of friends down here, as I'm sure you know. Where is she? We have her in a cell. In a cell. That's your idea of a favor? She's accused of stealing over $100,000 worth of jewelry. A cell was pretty unavoidable. $100,000? That's ridiculous. She buys leather bracelets at flea markets. That kid doesn't own $100 worth of jewelry. At the time of her arrest, she was wearing a $20,000 bracelet. She was? Mm-hmm. Do you have a good criminal attorney? 'Cause I can give you a few names. I mean, you gotta be prepared. A case like this? Take it to trial? It could wipe you out financially. Thanks, that's helpful to point that out at time like this, too. Tell me how much worse it could get. I know you think this is personal. This is not personal. Of course it's not. Can I see Carter? Where is she? Yeah, we both want to see her. No, not together. Can you give us a second, Kyle? Yeah. Uhh-uh... Our daughter's in a jail cell. Can we not do this... I don't want her to think that you're just gathering more material for another chapter in your book. The longer we have this conversation, the longer she sits alone. I just don't trust you with her. You don't trust me? Uhh-uh. You trust her? Why wouldn't I? She was arrested and charged for stealing over $100,000 worth of jewelry. That she would never do. She was wearing some at the time. Well, there's an explanation. Maybe she was planning to run away with Lori, and they would need money, and this would be something they could pawn or maybe it's Crash. Would you just stop this? This isn't who she is. I don't want this to be true any more than you, but talk to Kyle. Kyle. Yeah? Could you just tell me what this looks like? It's bad. Her friend Bird is ready to testify against her. Can you stop yelling me, okay? I know I messed-up. I just need to figure out a way to fix this. Why don't you go in there and admit that you lied? No, I can't do that, okay? My parents are barely in my life as it is. They're just looking for an excuse to forget I exist. They're already disappointed they can't ship me off to rehab like their friends do with their kids. Well, unless you step up, Carter's probably looking at prison time. What the hell are you talking about? What happened? Where's Carter? It's a long story, but the short answer is a cell at the Fairfax police precinct. Please don't freak out. But if you just give back the necklace, this will all be over. The necklace that you told me to pawn? I got 20 grand for it. It's worth 100. Okay, so then I did pretty well then. Can you just get back the necklace? I thought you needed the money. Not anymore. They won. Look, all you have to do is get back the necklace and my mom will drop all the charges against Carter. How about this? You get your mom to drop the charges against Carter first, and then I'll get you back the necklace. Crash, now really isn't the time to start developing morals. What happened to yours? (door buzzer) Oh, my God. Can we go now, please? I'll let you know about bail. Your father's looking into some criminal attorneys. We have some names. Why do I need a criminal attorney? I didn't do anything. You know your friend Bird is ready to testify against you? Obviously not my friend Bird. Don't be mad at me, but did Crash put you up to this? You know what, I actually am mad at you for asking that. You don't think he had anything to do with this, do you? Right now, I don't know what to think. You don't know what to think about me. Well, thank you very much for the vote of confidence. I don't want to believe that you have anything to do with this, but I can't say the same thing about Crash. This is not about Crash. This is about me. No, if he was involved in it and you knew about it, then you are an accessory. And what would happen to me? Now I do think that I need to talk to a criminal attorney... Can't you just go out there and talk to them and convince them to let me go? I will, as soon as they set your bail. Well, I can tell you who took the necklace. That would be lovely, who? Bird. She said her mom had a closet full of jewelry and she would never, ever miss it. Do you know why she took it? Do you know where it is? All right, now you're just interrogating me. You can't stop being a cop even for five seconds, can you? You know what, between you and your husband, I... think I might actually be better off in here. Just downplay it so she doesn't get too upset about Carter, okay? Okay. Oh, no. Later. Uh, we'll just talk to her later. I'm just leaving. Sorry about earlier. Yeah, me too. Six reallys. Six reallys. I didn't realize that you and Max were so.. close. Yeah. Where's Carter? I thought you said you were going to go get her. Still in jail. Jail? For what? Apparently she stole some of Bird's mother's jewelry. (snickers) No, she did not. Says who? Bird, for one. Bird is a sad and lonely girl who's been jealous of Carter since the day they met. Have you talked to her? Have I? No. The cops have. You are a cop. Not at the moment. Mom, you're always a cop. Go talk to her. She will crack so fast. There's no way she can look you in eye and say that Carter stole that jewelry. But, Taylor, the problem is that Carter knows where it is, or at least what happened to it. So what? It makes her an accessory. Well, at least bail her out. (knock on door) Now what? Woman: May we come in? (Elizabeth) Sure. Beatrix... say what you came to say. Um. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson... I've done a terrible thing. And I only hope that you and Carter and the rest of your family can forgive me. It seems my daughter stole my necklace and blamed your daughter. I've dropped all charges against Carter. See, I knew it. I told you. That is exactly what I said. You never listen to me. You were right. I was wrong. We were wrong. Now I'm going to station to pick up our daughter. Excuse me. How could this happen? I don't understand. Hey. I was just going to call you. I know, they're dropping the charges. I'm here to pick up... No, Liz. That's why I was going to call you. Carter's not here. Is she in the cell? I just went down there to tell her the good news. She's gone. Kyle, where is she? Crash came by Some idiot clerk allowed him to post bail for her. No, that's impossible. She's a minor. They can't. I know. But they did. When was this? I don't know. Maybe any hour ago. Elizabeth, I'm sorry. You let her go with him? She left with him? It wasn't me... How could you do that? I just got her back. And now she's gone? She's gone. Hey, you left this at Bird's. Wow, dad's book. Any good? I wasn't crazy about it, no. Oh, well. Who's gonna want to read a book called "Finding Carter" now?
