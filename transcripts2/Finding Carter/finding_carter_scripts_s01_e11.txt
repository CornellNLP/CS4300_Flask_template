 Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 Did you give that to her? 
 Hands behind your back, please. 
 Bird, tell them. 
 I'm here to pick up Carter... 
 No, Liz. 
 Crash came by. Some idiot clerk allowed him to post bail for her. 
 She left with him? 
 Whoo! 
 So where are we going? 
 Where do you wanna go? 
 Somewhere where nobody knows me. 
 (Phone beeping) 
 My God. 
 What? 
 Elizabeth put out an amber alert? 
 Dammit. 
 I wish everyone in the world wasn't looking for us right now. 
 Wait, everybody is looking for us. 
 My mom would have seen the amber alert. 
 We need to go leave a message for her with Max. 
 Why did you buy that? 
 Yeah. 
 I knew you'd come back. 
 Will you give that to her if you see her? 
 (Crash) Max, you wanna help us, right? 
 Well, I mean, I know you wanna help Carter. 
 Give us everything in your register. 
 Report it as a robbery. 
 Crash, what the hell are you doing? 
 The safety's on, see? 
 Call 9-1-1! 
 Max, my God. 
 God. 
 Help me. 
 What were you doing with a gun? 
 (Taylor) I don't know what's worse, you being abducted or you coming back here. 
 No, I will never forgive you. 
 Girls, the doctor has asked to see us. 
 (Elizabeth) What about the mini-mart, how many people do we have covering that? 
 Is he all right? 
 When can he come home? 
 How did it go? 
 He came through the surgery. 
 He's very fortunate that the wound was a through and through. 
 It could've been much worse. 
 Well, can we see him at least? 
 Currently Max is non-responsive. 
 Nonre... what does that mean? 
 Is that a coma? 
 Hopefully. 
 Hopefully, it's a coma? 
 If it's a coma, he can wake up. 
 When someone's just non-responsive... 
 At this point, we're in a waiting game. 
 The best thing you can all do is just go home and get some rest. 
 My staff and I will be in touch with you. 
 But please, please. 
 Look, surely, he's more likely to wake up if he hears voices he recognizes. 
 Please, can we see him? 
 All right, fine. 
 One person for one minute. 
 Carter! 
 (Door closing) 
 (Woman over P.A.) Radiology, line four. 
 Radiology, line four. (Monitor beeping) Max. Max, it's me. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I'm gonna make things right. I promise. But Max, you have to wake up. You have to wake up for me to do that. ♪ There you go ♪

I'm gonna do everything I can to make it right between us. Hey. Hi. Figured you'd be needing that. Same number. Thank you. You're dressed up. Job interview. What kind of interview? Teaching literature and essay writing to tenth graders at the McAllister Holt Academy. You already have a job, you're a writer. This might be better, don't you think? Than being a writer? No. I know it comes at a terrible time. I can easily cancel if you think I should. No, no, I don't want you to miss out on this. Wish me luck. David? Good luck. See you, bud. Hey. Hi. Where you going? I'm going to stay at the hospital until Max wakes up. I wanna be the first person he sees when he opens his eyes. Taylor, I'm sorry about earlier. I just didn't think. But, honestly, there is no way in hell he even knew I was in the room. Yeah, but I did. I know you love Max, but he is also my best and oldest friend in the entire world. If you care about Max so much, why don't you devote your time to finding your fugitive boyfriend and getting him arrested? This is giving me a headache. Okay, all right, the last thing that we need is the two of you going at each other. Don't worry, I'm leaving. Carter can find someone else to fight with. She always does. Look... There is something else that I need to tell you. What? This morning, I went down to the station, I talked to my captain. Okay. I am part of the team that is assigned to apprehend Crash. Now if Max dies... My God, please... If Max dies, that's felony murder. He didn't mean to shoot him. I told you, he thought the safety was on, it was an accident. I saw the footage from the security camera. And he pointed his gun at Max. And did you watch after? Crash lost his mind after that. Yes, I saw that. And then I saw him run away. Yeah. That's 'cause he thought he'd go to prison. Which is where he should be. Carter. Look at me. He left you alone with your best friend dying in your arms. I'm busy. Carter? What are you doing here? Crash has been calling me non-stop. He wants to see you. It's him. Hey, Bird, are you there, have you talked to her? Crash? Hey. It's so good to hear your voice. Don't call me on Bird's phone again. I didn't know how else to reach you. I have my old phone back. Where are you? Still here. I didn't mean to shoot Max, you know that, I... It was an accident. Crash. You just left me there. I know, I freaked out, I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. You didn't know you should stay and help me? I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Max is in a coma, Crash. Will you see me? No. I don't know. Crash, you have to turn yourself in. I can't. Yes, you can and then you can... You can explain your side of the story. Crash, if they catch you first, it's not gonna matter if it was an accident or not. No, it's not gonna matter anyway. I have to go. I'm gonna leave tonight. But, promise me you'll see me before I go. I can't Crash, I have to go. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Carter, please, just meet me. Here, you can go now. Carter, I'm here. I know you're upset about Max. I'm just trying to be your friend. Come on, Bird, I think we both know you're not that. If you could just let me explain myself... Explain what? You don't understand what it was like... Bird, you didn't wanna get in trouble with your parents so you had me sent to jail. It's a lot more complicated than that. Not to me, Bird. ♪

Who are you again? I... I'm Taylor. Where's Carter? She's not here because the doctor said only one of us could... Be in the room at a time. Honey, honey? I'm here. Everything's gonna be okay. You're gonna feel better real soon, okay? I'll be in the waiting room if you need me. The police said that her boyfriend shot him? Why, I... We tried the trailer park, he wasn't there. So he's not with his usual associates and we know from the highway patrol that he hasn't left the state. Yeah, what other place would matter to him? What about the place where his little brother died? The Weldon Warehouse. Truck exploded and he was held responsible even though he wasn't. Where is this Weldon Warehouse? It's about, a half-hour maybe. Okay, I'm there. You know what, I'm gonna check the chop shops. Maybe he traded his car in. All right, we'll meet back here. Okay. Grant, are you in there? You wanna play? You know how? No idea. So, guarantees you'll win. Which one are we? You're the dead one. Maybe if you teach me, it'll be more fun. Doubt it. Aw, come on, I'm a quick learner. This is how you shoot. This is how you move around. Okay, and what about that? That's to pause the game, dad. Okay, I'm good. No, Max's mom is in there. Karen's here? Can we talk? What? Were you and Max in love? What are you talking about? It's all Karen could talk about was you and Max. Taylor, Karen doesn't know what she's saying, come on. Carter, Karen loves you. And I defended you. I said it wasn't your fault that Max got shot, but everyone knows it was. Okay, well, Taylor, you don't have to say anything to Karen about me, all right? I'm gonna explain it. Yeah, explain how it was an accident. It wasn't my boyfriend's fault. His life story is so sad. What parent wouldn't love to hear that? It's Elizabeth, I have to take this. Crash. Hey, where are you? The hospital. I'm going back in to see Max, stop calling me. Carter, wait. Clear the hallway! Watch your back. Max, baby. I'm sorry. What's happening? It's his heart, it's something with his heart. He's going into surgery, you need to wait here. As soon if we find something out, we'll let you know. Crash? Listen, I've seen the truck. It's just me. Listen, I know how hard it is to turn your life around. You can do this. Crash, you can do the right thing. Hi, um... they're there. Hey. What's going on? Rich, don't make me do this alone. He's in the hospital. Max's mom? Yeah. What did the doctor say? This is really serious. Something cardiac. She was too upset to listen. Yeah. Okay, let me see what I can find out. I'll be right back. Great, I've hit my data limit. I can't send any more texts. Stupid phone. Karen, look, here. You can use mine. 
 
 Carter. I knew you weren't responsible for what happened, okay? As soon as I heard, I knew no matter what went on, it wasn't your fault. I mean, you stayed with him, right? You called 911. What would Max do without you? You've taken such good care of him since he's been here. He was so excited to move down here and see you. You have been such an important influence in his life. I'm going to the vending machines. You were so important to him. Carter, where's Taylor? Taylor. This is what I found out. Even though the bullet missed Max's heart, it's still not functioning the way it should. What? Well... well, can they fix it? I don't know. He's still in surgery. But they promised me that we could talk to the doctor as soon as he comes out. Karen? Hi, I'm Elizabeth. I'm the girl's mom. I just wanted to let you know that Max, he's like a member of our family, and he is getting the best care in the world right now, I promise you. And I am doing everything I can to apprehend the kid that did this. Your Carter's real mom. Yeah. I know. It's okay. It's okay. ♪ I've gone on too long ♪ Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. ♪... This heart of stone ♪ (Train whistle blowing) ♪ Just let me go ♪ 
♪ Just let me go ♪ Still not talking to Bird? No, I'm not. Why not? She seems to wanna make up with you. Well, that's between me and Bird. Why do you think you're the only one who's allowed to be upset? Is this because of what Karen said about me and Max? Excuse me? You have no reason to be jealous. You are his girlfriend, and he loves you. Who said I was jealous? He can't hate me because she still cares about me. I'm the only one she knows here. I can't believe you just said that, Carter. You are a mess! Seriously, you are such a mess. Thanks, Taylor. Sure. Thank you. Yeah, I am a mess right now. I am. I am a mess because my best friend just got shot, because my boyfriend was the one who shot him, because my friend betrayed me, and now, because my sister hates me. (Sighs) I am trying to make this all better. (Phone buzzing) (Sniffling) Well, you need to figure it out. Max is out of surgery. What? Now, Carter. You guys. Well, a heart issue is always very serious. And they can become very complicated. I don't understand, you're saying he had a heart attack? It's what's known as a cardiac tamponade. Blood began pooling in the pericardium... It's a sac around his heart... Putting pressure on it so that it couldn't pump. His blood pressure dropped and his body went into shock. We were able to cut a window in the sac and allow it to drain. So his heart is functioning normally now. It's functioning normally, yes. He's still non-responsive? That hasn't changed. And do we know when he's gonna wake up? No, I'm sorry. We're in a waiting game. Okay, that is the exact same thing you said last night. Carter, it's okay, we will handle it. We cannot handle this. I can't handle this. We're gonna get through this, okay? But, we have to be strong for Max. Okay? Okay, for Max. ♪ Help, help I'm drowning ♪ 
♪ In the sea where I found you ♪ 
♪ The kerosene in your skin ♪ 
♪ The chemistry that I'm bound to ♪ 
♪ Thought I drew out the cancers... ♪ DNA, fingerprints, anything? Damn. I just knew that he was there. Psst. Hi. You know, I forgot to ask you, how did that job interview go? I forgot, too. I got it. You got it? Yes. Fantastic. Congratulations! Thank you. Where? McAllister Holt Academy. Really? I used to go there, once upon a time. It's a great school. I was... I was kicked out, for a minor infraction I don't do no more. Anyway... That's great, dad, I'm happy for you. Thank you, sweetie. Congratulations. Thank you. You know, Karen, um... Taylor's been taking care of Max's plants all this time. Thank you. He loves his plants. The blooms came in on his hibiscus. He's gonna be so excited. Well, that boy is never happier than when he has some dirt and a new package of seeds. Except when he's making croutons. He makes croutons? Taylor taught him. He's really good at it. Oh my gosh. Well, if you aren't the sweetest. She is, Karen. She's the sweetest. Max really loves her. Well, I can certainly see why. He's so kind and soulful. And those are two words that I don't use much. Basically, it's impossible not to like the guy. He's great. He's at the top of my "if I could be anybody in the world" list. Like, above Beyonce. Yeah, he... he's like a brother to me. Well, he always wanted a brother, so... I was... I was just too young. We could tell you about all the funny and great things Max has done since he's been here. Like... Laundry? Yeah. Yes. You let him do laundry? Okay, you guys know all the shirts that he wears that are the same color? They did not start out that way. That's why I'm wearing black. You can't avoid me forever. Fine. I don't know if you're gonna understand this, but... I'm terrified of my parents. Elizabeth isn't exactly a walk in the park. But at least you know she loves you. I don't even know if my mom likes me. And my dad is definitely not interested. I know, who doesn't have self-esteem issues, right? Well, besides you. Um, I have self-esteem issues. Well, if you do, they're practically invisible because... You're the girl who everybody wants to know, and who everybody wants to be with. I made a mistake. A really, really vicious mistake. And now, my parents are making whispers about boarding school. I'm sorry to hear that. Well... You gotta pay for your mistakes, right? Are you still in touch with him? Carter, I don't know if you're ever gonna forgive me, but I'm just trying to be a real friend for you now. I'm happy Crash is out of my life. But, I really think you need to get him out of yours. Carter. Carter, is it you? Yeah, it's me. Why didn't you pick up the phone? Why didn't you answer my texts? I told you, I'm at the hospital. Are you okay? No. Elizabeth, she was at the place today. She almost caught me. Now it's like every time I turn around, she's gonna be right behind me. She's not, okay? She's at the hospital, you can relax. Okay, all right, but I have to leave tonight. I... I need to see you. Crash, we're waiting to see if Max wakes up. All right, well, I have to leave by midnight,  no later than that. I'll be at the water tower. I can't. Carter, please. (Sighs) All right, fine, I'll come. Okay. Carter... wait. Guys, I have been in there for hours. I just need a break. I need to go get, like, a burger and fries or something. That sounds great, I could go for a burger and fries. Is she really going for a burger and fries right now? No, she's not really going for a burger and fries... (Gabe) Where's she going, Bird? Where am I going, Bird? To see Crash? Look, Carter, he's obviously a very unstable person. You can't go near him. He... He just wants to say good-bye. (Bird) You can't go! Carter, if I can see that he's scum, how can you not? Guys, he is not some, like, crazy, evil villain. He is just a guy who did a really, really stupid thing. And now, he is scared and alone, and he has no one in the world to help him. Well, you have to cut him loose. Gabe's right, he's just gonna drag you down. He already has. I... I can't deal with this. I have to sort this out. Carter, just don't do anything stupid, okay? (Sighs) For once, right? You came. Why did you run? Why did I run? I couldn't just stand there. Was I supposed to wait around? I... I couldn't, I couldn't stay. I'm sorry. I told you, I was sorry. Yeah, I believe you. I got rid of the gun. Threw it out. Let's sit, let's sit... No, no, no. No, I need the fresh air. It's a long drive to California. You're still going to California? Yeah. That was our plan, remember? Crash, if you stayed, you could tell everyone it was a mistake. I would support you. It's not like you'd be doing it on your own. The thing is, Carter, I'm not so sure that it was a mistake. What do you mean? Listen, I didn't mean to shoot Max, I didn't. But I shot him. Before I shot him, I was sitting in the truck, and I was watching you two touching and hugging and stuff. Yeah, me and Max are friends, we do that all the time. Yeah, and that pisses me off. When I was in juvie, they told me I... I had these triggers I needed to work on... Impulse control. You should have told me that. I told you. I warned you. The first day I told you, I destroy everything. No, Crash. No, please. Crash. You want so much to believe that you're a bad person. But, I don't buy it. I don't. You'll never convince me. I was there. It was an accident, I saw it. God, I can't believe I'm never gonna see you again. You don't know that. You remember the first time you kissed me? It was so ballsy, it was right in front of Elizabeth. The way that you looked at me, you looked into my eyes, I'll never forget it. See, there it is. This is love, this... This is that unbearable feeling that... (Sighing)... never goes away. Why do people want to feel like this? I don't know. (Police siren blaring) ♪ If I was not myself ♪ 
♪ And you were... ♪ No. Crash. Crash, let me see your hands! Put your hands... get your... (Whispering) I'm sorry. Get her away from here, now! Crash. Come on. ♪ I'm there in the water ♪ 
♪ Can't you see? ♪ Crash! ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪ You okay? I don't know what I feel. Listen, I'm really sorry about the way the night went. I know that I promised you that I wouldn't be a cop, track your car or follow you. But, I knew that you were going to meet Crash, and I couldn't let that happen. I knew that. What? I knew you were gonna follow me. In fact, I was counting on it. I don't understand what you're telling me. Look... When Crash told me he was gonna leave town, a big part of me just wanted to let him go and... and just let the whole thing be over. But, I could never do that to Max. Why didn't you say something to me? Because, I needed to see him. I needed to hear what he had to say. I really don't think anyone does anything for no reason whatsoever. You taught me that, actually. I really thought I could convince him to hand himself in. But... I was scared. I didn't know if he still had the gun and... I didn't wanna do it alone. But I knew I wouldn't have to. You wanted me to be there. I needed you to protect me. (Sighing) 'Cause you're my mom. And I love you. I love you. (Sighing) Hey. Hey. Is anyone in there? I was, but I had to leave. I couldn't take the beeping anymore. Dad took Karen to a hotel. You can go in if you want. Can we talk for a second first? Sure. Please don't give up on me. I've put you through hell. I'm still putting you through hell. But, I promise you, I'm going to make it up to you. Thanks for having Crash arrested. Was that hard? I loved him. And for whatever reason, I couldn't see past that. Sorry. Do you still love him? Thank you. Mom said you were really great. She says you have a future in hostage negotiating. Great. Thanks, mom. That's the first time I've heard you make that mistake. (Laughing) Oh. Um, not a mistake. Wow. That's big. Yeah. Wanna go in? (Monitors beeping) Doctor says he could make a full recovery. So we shouldn't give up hope. Well, I'm not giving up hope. Are you? Hell, no. Never. I brought you some stuff. Clothes and stuff, so you've got something to wear. Carter, this is your sweater. Yeah, I know. But you always said how much you liked it. And your makeup bag's in there as well. You know... When Max wakes up. Thank you. ♪ I could be the eye ♪
