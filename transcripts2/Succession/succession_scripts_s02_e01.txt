 Kids, I changed my mind. I'm staying on. 
 As CEO. Head of the firm. You f*cked me. 
 Three years ago, you were still in the nuthouse. 
 Dad, it's called rehab. 
 And I'm in recovery. 
 Aye... 
 Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad?! 
 While Dad is ill, the family proposes that Kendall run the company with Roman as COO. 
 Yes. Very serious. 
 I'm not saying I would make a better CEO. That's unsaid. 
 It's not unsaid when you say it. 
 You know that he gave me a job? Why would I know? 
 'Cause I thought everybody might be talking about me. 
 Yeah, no. Everyone was only talking about you, Cousin Greg. 
 Come in and see me, and I'll look after you. 
 There's a huge debt problem. Three billion. Don't jump. 
 I've had an idea. You give me four billion dollars. 
 I stay boss. You invest... 
 I didn't know you were coming in. 
 Just making sure you're not selling any more of the company from under me. 
 Dad's not well. If he's not careful, he's gonna destroy the company. 
 The only way he'll respect you is if you try to destroy him. 
 I love my father, but he is currently unfit to run this company, and I'm calling for a vote of no confidence in him as CEO and chairman. 
 Bullshit. No. 
 All in favor. 
 You better be smelling your f*cking armpit, Romulus. 
 Against. 
 Where you been? Meeting about a perspective job. 
 With your father's enemy? 
 You want this enough to go to war with your family? 
 Sandy, he wants your piece of pie. 
 Bring me in. We do this properly. 
 Takeover, leverage buyout. Hostile. 
 What's your end? CEO. 
 I wanna talk about you properly. 
 Come in. I always thought you were the smartest. 
 Oh, so that's why you tried Kendall and Roman first? 
 Why are you so jumpy about this, Ken? 
 Why am I jumpy? f*cking Rome. 
 f*cking Shiv and Connor. 
 About taking the company out of family control? 
 Is this a f*cking bear hug? 
 f*ck off. 
 You don't have a connection for some powder? 
 Yeah. 
 Look out! 
 This could be the defining moment of your life. 
 A rich kid kills a boy. You'll never be anything else. 
 Or you could be nothing at all. 
 My boy. My number one boy. 
 Excuse me, sir? Mr. Roy? 
 Um, could you come with me, please? 
 What is it? 
 We were asked... There's, um, a gentleman here for you. 
 For me? W... 
 W... What is this? What do you mean? 
 This came as an instruction to me, so could you just come with me please? 
 Hey. Hi, Kendall. I'm Ragnar Magnusson. 
 Oh... Hi. How are you? 
 Hi, uh... what is this? 
 Uh... Do you want to get dressed and we can talk? 
 We might need to pull you out. 
 Pull me out? 
 I'm sorry, who... Wh... who is "we"? 
 Who are you? It's fine, Kendall. I'm Ragnar. 
 I have relationship with Pinks in London and your father has asked us to manage getting you on television as soon as possible. 
 Uh-huh. Okay. 
 I've only been here like 48 hours and, uh... 
 I'm meant to have a silica, uh, mud treatment. Can I just, uh... 
 Uh... No. 
 I'm sorry. It's not going to work. 
 So, it was felt Sandy, Stewy and Maesbury Capital wouldn't proceed with their bid without you, but they have gone public with the bear hug, and the advice was we should get you on TV this morning as New York opens. Okay? 
 Okay. Right. 
 Um, but will... will that help? 
 A public and personal declaration of withdrawal could be really helpful. 
 You okay, mate? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, you could do this. 
 You could stop it. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 I mean, if my dad wants me to do it, uh, I'll... I'll do it. 
 I saw their plan; Dad's plan is better. 
 How are you feeling? 
 You look good. 
 Yeah, I feel, uh, I feel good. 
 Great. 
 Good? 
 Hi! 
 Hi, Karolina. Good to see you. 
 Hey, Ken. Hey. 
 So, we've got a flash studio with an affiliate. 
 We have hair and make-up and a suit for you. 
 You okay, Ken? 
 Uh, yep. Okay. 
 Okay. 
 They will wanna go for the tough one, so let's run it. 
 Okay? "So, um, you allied" with one of your father's bitterest business rivals in a maneuver that could see him lose the firm. 
 Why did you do that? 
 And why did you change your mind... 
 "and pull out?" 
 Okay, so then, "I saw their plan, but Dad's plan was better." 
 Right? 
 Right, Kendall? 
 Right? Uh-huh. Yeah. I got it. 
 I'm pulling this. 
 Uh-huh. No, I got it. I got it. Maybe we'll do something with friendly print on arrival. I got it. I'm good. 
 Um, Ken? Excuse me, can we get a tissue, please? 
 He needs a tissue. 
 Just watch the shirt. 
 Karolina, I can do this, okay? 
 Karolina, I'm okay. 
 Karolina, I'm okay. 
 Hi, Kendall? Ten seconds. 
 I'll red-light you once you're on with Sacha, okay? 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 We're joined now by Kendall Roy, who was recently allied to a proposed bid by private equity fund Maesbury to take control of Waystar Royco out of the hands of his own father, media legend Logan Roy. 
 Now, Kendall, you know I'm gonna ask you this, how are things between you and your dad? 
 Uh, pretty good. 
 You know, we're... we're, uh, we're... we're pretty close, so, you know, that's how we are. 
 Oh, well, that's a... 
 We take the... Sorry. Great attitude. 
 Sorry. Go ahead. No... O... Okay. 
 So, let's dive in. Tell us what happened. 
 Right. Why did you get involved? 
 Why did you back out? 
 Right. Um... 
 I mean, there's a, uh... myriad, uh, factors in a decision. 
 A whole lifetime can lead to a moment, and, uh, when I... when I sat down and really looked... 
 God, he looks terrible. 
 He's like a... sweaty corpse. 
 Yeah. 
 He looks waxy, like an unshaven candle. 
 Uh, but I mean, um... 
 You know, the long and the short of it is, I... saw their plan, and my dad's plan was better. 
 Look, this is, uh, this is tough for me and my family. 
 But I made an assessment looking at the sector and the firm's trajectory that, you know, shareholders were being ignored. 
 But the fact is, those concerns are being addressed, and, uh, you know, it... it... it comes down to shareholder value. 
 Um, and, you know... frankly, uh, what also sort of become obvious, was there were some unstable personalities involved uh, with this deal. 
 "Ooh, I'm Kendall and I'm a sassy little bitch." 
 What do you think? What's going on? 
 I thought he was benched. 
 Ah, what the... What's he saying? We got shitty Wi-Fi. 
 He looks weird, right? 
 He looks demented. Why is he so shiny? 
 Why do you have shitty Wi-Fi? 
 We wanted a place without Wi-Fi. 
 I mean, to me he looks like a f*cking joke, but what would an average Joe think? 
 Hey, I'll call you back. 
 So, once upon a time, word was that you were in pole position to take over, right? 
 And, uh, God forbid your dad was hit by a bus tomorrow, is there a plan? 
 Uh, well, um... I would say... uh, the plan would be for the Municipality of New York to, uh, find another bus, because if my dad gets hit by a bus tomorrow, the city will be down one bus, not one CEO. 
 Fair enough. Fair enough, Ken... 
 Ladies and gentlemen, the first f*cking thing my son's ever done right in his life. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Ah, how the mighty are fallen. 
 He was a king once. Now look at him. 
 Eating sh1t with feet of clay, a f*cking neutered hound-dog. 
 I think he did okay. 
 Oh, yes, he did great. He did just fine. 
 But, Jesus! Elvis on the f*cking toilet! 
 Like, he doesn't come back from this, right? 
 Like, he just walked around the New York Stock Exchange with his severed dick in his hand asking where was good for free soup. 
 He just ate the big dog dick. Sucked that pooch bone dry! 
 Honey, what's the reaction? What happened to the price? 
 Uh, dropped down, shot back up. 
 I think Sandy and Stewy offer Dad a way out, asset swap. 
 Right? I mean, that's what the next move is. 
 Yeah, I would think so, right? 
 If they're going to proceed. Well, they can't go hostile. No. 
 Especially without Kendall's equity. 
 sh1t. No. 
 You wanna abandon honeymoon? 
 No, I mean... No, I don't want to. Do you? 
 No. I don't want to. No. 
 Do you? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Did you get the bike? 
 Yeah, your dad didn't want you to ride all alone, Ken. 
 We got a guy. 
 Oh, here he is! Mr. Potato Head! 
 My plastic adversary. 
 Welcome to the bunker. 
 Say hello to the grunts. 
 No offense, Karl. None taken. 
 Yeah, well, a bit of offense, Karl, because a smarter CFO might have seen this f*cking disaster coming. 
 Got it. Yep. Offense now taken. 
 Thank you for the TV thing. 
 I mean... You know, the least I could do. 
 Price is up a little, so I don't think it's done anything for us. 
 Well, at least he tried. 
 Okay, Karl, I need to de-brief the double agent. 
 The ground pounders can f*ck off. 
 All right, I'll get the investor call list for later, and... 
 I'll, uh, update you in, what, 20, on the... 
 No, no, no. You're staying. 
 Stay. 
 Okay. Now you. Step up onto the rack. 
 I'm gonna pull you limb from limb like a piÃ±ata, see what falls out. 
 Okay, so, you want... what? 
 I want their game plan. What their timetable is, the capital structure. Endgame. What they might accept. 
 What their weak points are. But we'll start at the start. 
 When did they approach you? 
 Um, when did they approach me? 
 Mm-hmm. Did it take long or did you open your legs on the first date? 
 Well, no, they took a fair time to persuade me to, uh... 
 Betray me. 
 Yeah. Well, that's nice. 
 Look, do you want the psychodrama of the whole thing, or...? 
 What do they think I'll do? 
 Well, uh, Stewy thinks you might come to the table. 
 Sandy thinks it will be hostile. 
 They think they'll win? 
 Yeah. We... They... They think, uh... 
 I guess when I talked about inside the firm... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Uh, they got the impression that there was some erratic decision-making. 
 They think you're emotional, unstable, not necessarily logic driven, getting weaker and you'll crack under pressure. 
 Hmm. 
 And who are they hitting? 
 Obviously, major shareholders. 
 Most institutional are, as you'd expect, risk averse and there's a big degree of sort of legacy trust in you as a kind of one-shot voodoo guy who holds the whole thing together. 
 That it? 
 Um... 
 Look, let me, uh... 
 I'm going to, uh... get those call lists, huh? 
 Yeah, I talked to their PR team and, uh... 
 I gave them what medications you're on. 
 And they have for background you hitting Iverson. 
 And they have you pissing on the floor of my office. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Listen, Dad, obviously, I'm, uh... 
 I... I feel awful, and I just wanna say... 
 Fine. Well, f*ck off. They'll put you somewhere. 
 Investor calls. 
 Pour me some buckets of cold sh1t on the bid, all right? 
 So, Paul has the list of the top ten shareholders that we'd like you to hit and he'll talk you through all the lines and... 
 Okay? Okay. 
 All right. Yup. Okay. 
 Um, listen, Karolina. Is Jess back? 
 Uh, no, but we can reach out to Jess. 
 Yeah, just normally on, uh, on some matters, Jess speaks to, um, my friend Nick for me. 
 And, uh, he sources for me. 
 Right. 
 Right. 
 Yeah, I... I... I need, um... 
 I... Look, I'm... I'm going to be cleaning up my act. 
 You know, I have been. Mm-hmm. 
 But, honestly, right now, I need a straightener. 
 Thank you. 
 You know, I, um... 
 I was quite disappointed I didn't get any advance warning of this attack, Jamie. That's quite disappointing. 
 How does my banker not know? 
 Sandy's tough, and his operation's a steel box. 
 Nobody knew. 
 Uh-huh. 
 So, uh, what's your move? 
 What's my move? 
 Look at the f*cking wine I'm serving you. 
 I'm f*cking wining and dining you. 
 What's my move? I mean, I don't know. I guess... the obvious, uh, I'll say I'm thinking, and, uh, drag it out, hope that it dies, uh... 
 Name a successor. 
 Uh-huh. 
 That could be good. 
 Who? 
 Well, that's a bit complicated. 
 What else I got? On the defense. 
 Well, that's, uh, difficult. 
 How much do I have to f*cking pay you to say something? 
 Look, you don't want to sell, you don't wanna sell, you don't wanna sell. 
 So where's my margin to tell you something you don't wanna hear? 
 Well, try to think of it as a long-term investment in my trust in you. 
 All right. In all honesty, on the business fundamentals, you should make a deal and sell. 
 If you don't, it's going to be a vicious fight. 
 It could extend to months, years. 
 Perhaps you win. Perhaps. 
 But till then, nothing will get done. 
 It'll soak up all of your resources, all of your attention, beating them away with every regulatory, financial and political weapon that you have at your disposal. 
 There's blood in the water, and your price is edging down. 
 Tech is coming. Tech is here. 
 Tech has its hands around your throat. 
 There's maybe one, two legacy media operations that will make themselves big enough to survive. 
 The price that Sandy's offering is inflated. 
 It's inflated by bitterness, ego and spite. 
 You choose not to sell, well, what's going to be different in two, four years? 
 Are things gonna change? 
 More people gonna read your newspapers? 
 Watch TV? 
 Culturally, structurally and financially, you're in the toilet. 
 In five years, you'll be in the mega toilet. 
 The wise thing to do is to sell. 
 Now, generally, you do the wise thing. 
 But no, no, obviously not this time. 
 This time you'll... you'll call me something disgusting and throw a decanter at the wall. 
 In terms of this investigation... we will explore how and why this occurred. 
 And we plan for the most thorough internal investigation ever seen. 
 Uh, one for Roman Roy. 
 When will the investigation start, and any issues that are looking like likely causes? 
 Um... 
 Well, on, uh, on the timing? Right away. 
 We take this incredibly seriously. 
 Um, and as for, um... 
 Uh, as for determination of the cause, we just don't wanna speculate. 
 And I don't wanna be facetious, but, Sarah, on that point, I'm not a rocket scientist. 
 All right then. Director Sato, one more question: 
 Is Waystar Royco ready... to accept liability? 
 Will there be a financial settlement offered to the victims' families? 
 Uh, I'm very sorry for this. 
 For example... 
 Holy sh1t. Did you get the call? Did you get this? 
 Is this for real? Yeah, I got it. 
 Sell? He wouldn't, would he? 
 Tom. 
 Holy sh1t. He's saying he's selling? 
 Mm-hmm. That's... 
 He would never sell, would he? Do we go? 
 Uh, I guess? 
 But, f*ck! The wedding and the honeymoon f*cked? 
 What a nutty b*st*rd! 
 What a f*cking egocentric great white! 
 m*therf*cker. 
 Nice abode, man. 
 You okay? 
 Uh, what's... what's the news? 
 What's... what's going on? 
 How you doin'? 
 Yeah, all good. What's good, dude? 
 This place is sick! 
 Oh, yeah. It's fashion week; All the good penthouses are gone. 
 Yeah, no, I mean I'm sure... It... Yeah, could be way better. 
 I just... don't... know how. 
 f*ck. 
 What, uh... What's uh... What happened with your house? 
 Oh, I'm... I'm, uh, I got rid of it. 
 It smelt of Rava. 
 Oh, dude, yeah. 
 Did you bring, uh... 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Great. 
 Uh, did this come from Coach? 
 Oh, no, uh, he's out of town. That is from another source. 
 Eww. Dude. W... Where did you get this? 
 Uh, that? It... It's from a connection. 
 In the park. 
 Park coke? Yeah. 
 I'm doing park coke? Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 That is just perfect. 
 I'll be lucky if I have any f*cking nostrils left after this. 
 If my septum falls out, I'm gonna make you eat my septum. 
 Yeah, this guy's... this guy's got... got the good sh1t. 
 Yeah. 
 How is it? Is it... 
 Is it not... 
 Mm, yeah, no, that's the worst coke I've ever had. 
 No, dude... 
 Dude, I'm so sorry. 
 Like, he promised me. 
 Oh, he promised you? 
 I swear. I mean, I... Do you want me to take it back? 
 Yeah, take it back for a refund, Greg! 
 You know, did you... Did you keep the receipt? 
 Go get... go... Go take it back for a refund. 
 He's opening the summer palace to keep the summit out of view. It's the full f*ckin' number. 
 Okay. Yeah, well, I'll see you at the hellhole, bro. 
 See you at the shitpit, sis. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Oh, welcome! Apologies. 
 We'll have everything straight just as soon as... Oh, no, I'm early. 
 It's good. Don't worry. Just, uh, carry on. I'm not here. 
 What is the...? 
 Sorry about the smell. We're working on that. 
 God, that's... bad. 
 What the f*ck is that? 
 We can't exactly keep the windows open. 
 Have you tried scented candles? 
 Hey, what up s*x pot? Hey, Rome. 
 What is that stink? I know. 
 Dead kid shallow grave somewhere or what? 
 Hey, do you wanna get some air? 
 Yes. 
 You got a haircut. Yeah. 
 I hate it. That's because it's stylish. 
 I'm worried slash excited in case he actually f*cking kills Kendall. 
 I mean, he might kill him. 
 Could go for him. He could kill him. 
 Man, it'd be so weird if he killed him. 
 So this is good for you, right? 
 What, if he sells? 
 He's not gonna sell. 
 Hmm, I don't know about that. 
 Well, Kendall's out for good, right? 
 Best case for him is. 
 Dad keeps him on for like a week to kill the deal, then he's pure carcass. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm with Gil. 
 Connor's... 
 I mean, f*ck, Connor's gonna be in the White House. 
 Yeah, sure... 
 I guess. I mean, I hadn't considered it, but... 
 Oh, you hadn't considered? 
 Well, no, I... I guess, theoretically, yeah. 
 It's a cool moment. Hm? Good luck. 
 What? 
 Wha... I know what you're doing. 
 I... I'm just saying it's exciting. It's all set. 
 Sure. 
 You're f*cking with me. 
 But I'm impervious. Rome, I'm not f*cking with you. 
 I'm just saying good luck. Great. Well, thanks a lot. 
 What? 
 You're trying to get inside my head, but that's cool, I can cope. 
 What, maybe I'm f*ckin' ready for it. 
 You are. Yeah. 
 I mean, there's always room for you to blow up. 
 I mean... nobody mentioned blowing up, and then suddenly you mention blowing up? 
 And now what? I'm supposed to worry about f*cking blowing up? 
 I don't think you're gonna blow up. 
 I'm... 
 Rome, I think you're a super-talented superstar, and I... I love you. 
 Oh, you're such a f*cking bitch. 
 So you don't know what it is? 
 We're looking absolutely everywhere once again. 
 And all is well now with the renovation? 
 Yes, all that was resolved. 
 Open the doors. 
 It smells like the cheesemonger died and left his dick in the brie. 
 I need to breathe. 
 Kendall! 
 Come on! Let's hunt this out! 
 You know, you... You get used to it, actually. 
 Yeah, 200 million... and I need a clip on my nose to stop me f*cking retching. 
 You wanna talk about Laird's idea? 
 Nah. Later. 
 So, listen. 
 Hm? You all right? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm um, pretty good. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I... I could use some downtime at... at some point, to... 
 Yeah, sure, sure. Just don't, um, you know... 
 You know, uh, thinking's natural... can't be helped, but, you know... in limits. 
 Right. Exactly. Right. 
 Well, good. Good to have it all out. 
 Colin! 
 You should have to with Colin. 
 Everything is good? 
 Mm. Yeah? 
 Kendall. Hi, Marcia. 
 Ã‡a va? 
 How was your trip? 
 It was good. It was fine. 
 No accidents? No hiccups? 
 Uh, no. No hiccups. 
 Je sais. You've been through difficult times. 
 You're a nice boy. 
 But out of difficult times come strong men, right? 
 Marianne, come up with the candles, please. 
 Ken. 
 Got a minute? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 So, I don't know how much you know or care to know, but your dad wanted me to offer to talk you through things. 
 Oh, okay. 
 So, I'll just lay it out for you? 
 Oh, yeah, okay. I mean... 
 I don't need... 
 Yeah? Well, shall I, just so you know? 
 So, the site of the crash was discovered around 4:00 a.m. by two of our guys who saw the busted fence and followed that up. Uh-huh. 
 And they informed local police. 
 And as you know, an entry keycard was found and passed to me. 
 So, that's one individual outside of our loop, but who is known to me and who I consider secure. 
 Okay. 
 And the UK police sent divers in that morning. 
 Right. Right. 
 And the kid, uh, Andrew Dodds, well, he was dead obviously. 
 He'd unclipped his seatbelt, so he had survived the impact to do that. 
 Oh, okay. 
 So, the initial determination was that he was travelling solo and that hasn't been challenged. 
 And the riverbank was also heavily compromised by rain and our guys and the salvage operation, so there were no indicators of another individual. 
 So, that's where we are. 
 We expect the UK coroner to deliver a ruling of death by misadventure, and that will be it as far as we see. 
 Any questions or concerns? 
 Um... I do not think so, no. 
 Thank you, Colin. 
 Good.

 Oh, my God. 
 Look at him. 
 No. No thanks. 
 I don't think I can do this. 
 Well, shall we just hit him? With a stick or rocks? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Dead man walking. The f*cking cadaver awakens. 
 Hey. 
 When did you crawl in? 
 Yesterday. You? 
 So, you spoken to him? Is this real? Is he gonna do it? 
 Is he gonna sell? 
 Uh, I dunno. 
 Oh, you don't know. 
 So? 
 What the f*ck happened? Why'd you pull out? 
 I guess I, uh... 
 I saw their plan. 
 You know, Dad's plan is better. 
 Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. 
 Bullshit. Um, what happened? 
 I changed my mind, I guess. 
 f*ck you. And you couldn't have changed your mind before my wedding? 
 You do realize how f*cked you're going to be as soon as you're no longer any use to him, right? 
 He's got you eating f*cking humiliation gumbo on TV, and then what? 
 Yeah, Dad's gonna play a merry tune on you and then throw you out the f*cking window, and you know that, right? 
 He's like a s*x robot for Dad to f*ck. 
 He's like an old beaten dog. 
 Well, he's both of those things and also a piece of sh1t. 
 You know, he's a pathetic little f*cking narcissist who repeatedly puts his own self-interest above everything else and then tries to justify it with half-assed appeals of the rigors of the f*cking market. 
 You're a f*cking prick. 
 Uh-huh. Maybe I am. 
 Oh, come on, fuck-bag, fight back. 
 I... guys, I... I just... 
 I can't get into it. 
 Oh, you can't get into it? Uh-huh. Shucks. 
 f*ck you, man. Come on. Treat us. 
 Why did you actually back out? 
 I'm sorry, Shiv, about the wedding. 
 How dare you apologize to me? 
 You look like sh1t, by the way. 
 Why can't we keep it in-house? 
 It's costing me an arm and a f*cking leg. 
 They have located the source of the smell. You should come. 
 So, are you going to tell me what you're actually thinking? 
 Lot of moving parts. 
 The selling, is it real? 
 We'll see how it goes. 
 What do you think? 
 What? I have to dance for the Daddy too? 
 I've had strong advice to accept the offer. 
 What if I didn't know what I think? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Maybe you should sell. 
 You're old. You've not been well. 
 Okay. Very well. Thank you. 
 What? Putain de merde... 
 Oh, what the f*ck is that? 
 Oh, I need to see that contractor. 
 Get 'em down here. Are they here? Come on, we're starting. 
 And I don't want all this sh1t. 
 It's sat around in the stink! Pizza! We'll have pizza! 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So, what's the game do you reckon, Shiv? 
 I dunno. Say he's selling and see who squeals loudest? 
 Kind of loyalty test? Or productivity brainstorm? 
 Or we kill and eat Kendall as a pizza topping. 
 Hey-hey! 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Willa, hi! 
 So! Afternoon. 
 Thank you all for, uh, making it. 
 We need to discuss this bear hug. 
 Obviously, I have obligations to the shareholders to seriously consider it. Ha-ha. 
 Now Kendall's row-back may have hurt them, we'll see. 
 It may kill the bid, it may not. 
 But I guess the question that that's been put to me is do we really want this fight? 
 Or is now the moment to cash in and f*ck off out of the casino? 
 Because if we do fight, I need to tell the board who I want to take over. 
 So, please. I want you to speak freely. 
 What? 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
 Oh, come on. We're all pals here. 
 Oh, yeah. Let's f*ckin' have it out. 
 I think you should fight, but, uh... 
 I mean, you're the one who built it all. 
 You're the man, the myth, the legend. 
 Oh, that is adorable. 
 You're always looking out for Pops, aren't you, right? 
 But is he saying Dad should stay on because that's what Sandy and Stewy want? 
 How do we know he's not a double agent? 
 Nice to see you, Con. 
 Hey, Ken, I'm just saying what others are thinking. 
 It's possible. 
 Should we frisk him for a wire? Burn him? See if he's a witch? 
 He has taken his medicine. 
 He's taken his medicine? Is that it? 
 Dad, you beat Roman with a f*cking slipper in Gustav till he cried for ordering lobster, remember? 
 And Kendall tries to kill you and he's five minutes out in the cold? 
 It is not polite to order the most expensive item on the menu when you're not paying, Siobhan. 
 We're not doing memory lane here. 
 Come on, spit it out. What do you all think? 
 Stick or sell? 
 Well, I for one think you're in the prime of your life and I think another decade is just what the doctor ordered. 
 That's one stick. 
 You want me to go? I mean, sell seems cool... 
 Hey, Dad, Willa thinks selling seems cool. 
 Asshole. 
 Dad, I think it is possible that you have sometimes somewhat chilled the atmosphere of free-flowing debate. 
 You know, Kodak was trading at about a hundred dollars a share back in '97. 
 Yesterday, you could pick it up at about three bucks. 
 That could be us. 
 If we cash out, we could walk away with ten billion. 
 Roman. 
 What do you think? 
 I dunno. Uh, I f*cking love money, but I'm really scared of you, so... 
 Uh, honestly, um, I'm not sure I'm willing to give my strategic advice in a public forum when I could be a player in any future moves. 
 Um... 
 Um... Dad? 
 Dad? 
 Dad? Is he in there? 
 Yeah, he went in there. 
 One by one, come in. One by one. 
 One by one? 
 Seriously, what the f*ck? 
 I'm not going in there. 
 So, now that there's no one here to hear your wonderful insights, what do you say? 
 Um... Okay, um... 
 I actually do have a pitch on this, Dad. 
 Financialization. 
 Float hot. I mean, keep news for political power, for market manipulation capability. 
 But the rest, we play the markets with. 
 You and me up in a little pod above the city, f*cking start ups and sh1tting on pension funds. 
 Highly maneuverable, highly mobile. 
 And in terms of getting rid of Sandy and Stewy? 
 Oh, f*ck 'em. Scare 'em off. 
 As in? 
 As in, you know... Scooby Doo it, Dad. 
 You just dress up as ghosts in the theme park. 
 Um, you know, we just use the lawyers, the PIs, the honey-trap hookers, all the unpleasant people at our disposal. 
 Call in all the favors. 
 f*cking President Raisin, all the Senate cock sucks who owe us. 
 f*cking kill, kill, kill. 
 Jesus, Shiv, might he actually sell? 
 
 
 
 You know, it's really happening in there. 
 It's like playing f*cking Gin Rummy with Zeus. 
 I don't buy the selling. It's a test, no? 
 Whoever tell Solomon not to asset-strip the baby gets to keep the baby. 
 But it... it can't be Kendall, can it? Yeah. 
 No, it's not gonna be Roman. 
 Just take it easy, Tom. 
 I know, I ju... I just think the least that we want for me is to get me out of parks and cruises, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Into something like heartland media. LA. 
 One of the key divisions, you know? Or do we ask? 
 Do we just ask? Do we accelerate the plan? 
 You know, could I consider the big trousers? 
 Could I fill them out? 
 You know, 'cause I've been eating a lot of sh1t from the... 
 From the kids' menu. You know? 
 I really have. I know, honey. 
 He's dying. Riddled with cancer. 
 Rome... 
 What? It's a funny joke. 
 "Dad's got cancer." What's not funny about that? 
 Sick puppy. 
 No, but, um, he asked me to run the company. 
 I'm kidding. Am I? 
 Shiv! 
 So... The studio? CFO? Mm-hmm. 
 Kill Karl. 
 Shiv, dentist is ready. 
 So? 
 So, what are you, best pals with him now? 
 Have you done a deal? 
 Come on, Shiv. Talk to me. 
 Sell? 
 All right. 
 Fine, from my perspective, truth be told, yeah. 
 Selling would be great. No more blowback with my career. 
 I'll take my money. Five years' time, I'd like to be free of this company and the Roy name. 
 This company means a lot to me. 
 Yeah, sure, Dad. So, fine. Keep it. It's a toy shop. 
 Keep running it for sentimental reasons until you nod out. 
 That's it? Mm-hmm. 
 No hope? 
 Well, if you wanted to get into it... 
 Look, you'd have to forget everything, IBM it. 
 I haven't really thought, but what's obvious is, shutter the businesses that burn cash, or someone else does better. 
 We make video games consoles. Hm? Why? 
 We make indie f*cking movies! Why? 
 Do we get a theme park ride out of it? 
 No? We have an arm that launches f*cking telecoms satellites that blow up. 
 No. Restructure for the future. Maybe merge with a distributor, expand parks, expand cruises, lose news. Paper and TV. 
 News is trouble. Ten new parks in China, Russia, Middle East. 
 You don't need the feedback from f*cking news. 
 Right. 
 But you haven't really thought about it? 
 Well, those are just the obvious moves. 
 Well obviously, I always wanted one of you kids to take over. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Well, what about it? 
 Yeah, we've done that. What about Tom? 
 So. 
 No? 
 If I keep going, if we fight... 
 I have to name Kendall. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I see what this is. I see it. 
 You know, I f*cking see it. You've done a little dirty deal. 
 What, so, you keep Kendall on to kill the bid and then he... he takes over when you step down in a year? 
 What a squalid little f*cking backroom deal. 
 He blackmailed you, didn't he? Oh, Shiv. 
 No. No! I... I... If he takes over, I'll sell my shares. Yeah, I'll join Sandy and Stewy. 
 I'll get Gil to go for you. 
 I... I... I mean, I'll kill him. I'll f*cking kill him! 
 Shiv, why so angry? 
 I... I haven't done a deal with Kendall. 
 I do what I want. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And what I've decided I'd like to do is to formally ask you to come in and be the next chief executive of this company. 
 I don't think I'm the right person. 
 Well, you know, I'm pretty smart and I think you are. 
 You are, Shiv. 
 You're the one. 
 Are we actually having this conversation? 
 Yes, we are actually having this conversation. 
 And selling? Yeah? That's... What is that? Is that real? 
 Of course. If you don't come in, yeah. 
 I mean, Roman? No. 
 Connor? Ha! I might as well sell, right? 
 Dad! 
 You know, I didn't build all this up to have some f*cking rockstar CEO waltz in and take over. 
 Dad, I don't think so. 
 Really? Because if there's really no hope of you coming in, I'd rather cash out. 
 Look, if this is the way we're having this conversation anyway, then yeah, fine, sell. 
 Fine, I'll do it. 
 Right now. 
 I'll tweet, the markets will move, and that'll be that. 
 Bullshit. 
 You don't care if I sell? 
 Don't be a f*cking jerk, Dad. 
 You wanna do it? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, of course, I'd be interested. If it's real. 
 This is real. 
 Yes, of course. Dad, I can do it. 
 I could... I would... 
 Why did you never ask me, huh? 
 I would kill this. I'd f*cking destroy it! 
 Yes. 
 This is wonderful, Siobhan. 
 This is real? 
 This is real. 
 Remember this, this slant of light. 
 Remember this. 
 This is it. 
 Well, we're gonna need to talk about it. 
 For now, we need to keep this between us. 
 I gotta think about Tom, Gil... 
 Of course. We have to think about the choreography anyway. 
 I mean, get you up to speed, you know, fast track you. 
 And as soon as you have the experience... we name you. 
 Yes? 
 Yes! 
 f*ck. 
 Yes. All right. 
 Yes. 
 Ha! 
 What? 
 Ah, it's just my dealer. 
 Viagra? 
 Antiquities. 
 Um, there's a package of items my bidder is in for. 
 Ah, hell, why not. 
 Like what? Uh, Napoleonica. 
 Just some items. 
 In... Including Napoleon's pen1s. 
 That's not the central item. 
 It's... just a package, with some letters and some other artifacts, but yes, that has come to market. 
 Napoleon's pen1s? 
 Mm. It's obviously not an item of interest to serious scholars, but as a curio, sure. 
 A British surgeon snipped it off. 
 Connor's trying to buy Napoleon's dick. 
 Hmm. Naturally. Is it pickled in a jar, or...? 
 It's dried. Yeah, really not much to see nowadays. 
 Yeah, it's kinda like, what, like a strip of beef jerky? 
 Yeah, it's a mere trifle, historically speaking. 
 So, what are you gonna do? Get that and Hitler's nutsack? 
 Blend it into a take-over-Europe smoothie? 
 Hey, how'd it go? 
 Yeah, cool. He offered me the company. 
 I told him to, uh, send you to look at pineapple production in Honduras. 
 Hey. So? How'd it go? What did he say? 
 Uh, yes. Where am I going? 
 How's the plan? Lot of options. 
 Jesus, Shiv! 
 What have you f*cking landed me? Is it huge? 
 Yeah. No, I had some leverage. 
 Yeah? And, uh... 
 I got you into the belly of the beast. 
 Chair of Global Broadcast News. ATN, baby. 
 sh1t. 
 Holy sh1t! Oh, my God! 
 Wait, is there a... What about... What's, uh... 
 Does it fit with Cyd, Peach? 
 Is that an overlap? 
 Yeah, no. Dad likes that. Okay. 
 You know, two contenders, one chair, that's his favorite. 
 It's an invitation to step up. Whoa. 
 You gotta eat the Peach, baby! 
 f*ck! Global Broadcast News. Mm-hmm. 
 Wow. Yeah. 
 So, what did you... What did you say? 
 Is he not s... He's not selling? 
 Did he offer you more stock? 
 No, he, uh... Bunch of mind games. 
 Okay. 
 Um, you know, classic Dad. 
 Okay. 
 Afternoon. Afternoon. 
 So? 
 What is it? 
 I see you. 
 Sir? 
 We spoke on the telephone, isn't that right? 
 Yes. 
 You were chiseling me a little, on the stable works. 
 Rich old f*cking guy! 
 We'll pad it 30 percent, cream for the f*cking cat. 
 No, sir, it was a time and material job straight up. 
 So you got a bit disappointed when I set a 200K ceiling so you stuffed a f*cking bag of live raccoons to rot in my chimney? No, sir. 
 "No, sir, no, sir, three bags full, sir." 
 f*ck off! Look at me. 
 No, sir. Don't know about that. 
 Yeah? Well, I'll pay you 100 grand all in and we're done. 
 That... That that won't even cover the materials, sir. 
 I can't do that. 
 Try to stink me out? I won't f*cking have it! 
 That was a 300-grand job, sir. That was the price... 
 Yeah? Well, sue me. Good luck. 
 Sir! 
 My lawyer used to work for the Justice Department. 
 Who's your lawyer? Mr. f*cking Magoo? 
 Oh, God. 
 Folks, uh, before we break up. 
 Can I say a word? 
 Yes, sir, captain, sir! 
 Listen, after taking soundings from all of you, my nearest and dearest, it seems my friend Laird had a good point. 
 In three- or four-years' time, I think... there will only be one legacy media operation left. 
 Well, I say... let that be us. 
 Whoo! Yes! f*ck yeah. 
 One firm... All right! 
 To stand up to tech. 
 One firm left, last man standing. 
 We're gonna be the number-one media conglomerate in the world. 
 That's great, Dad. That's great. 
 Here, here. 
 Where can I get some of the Kool-Aid? 
 I want some of that. 
 Kendall and Roman will act as co-chief operating officers while I personally devote my time to the fight against this take-over. 
 Excuse me, did... Did you just co-chief? 
 N... No, he's coming back? 
 We need to stick tight. Tighter than ever now. 
 But he... No, sorry. Excuse me. Um... 
 He... He tried to help your oldest enemy to take over and he gets a promotion, is that what's happening? 
 That's my decision. 
 Well, it's bullshit. 
 And are you gonna name a successor? 
 After some consideration, I think we just need a name to flag privately to big investors for now. I mean, could be anyone. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 I mean, it could be a stuffed shirt. 
 Gerri. It could be Gerri. 
 Now, you might just as well say Gerri. 
 Congratulations. Wow. 
 Well, okay. Thank you. 
 It won't be Gerri, but Gerri's fine. 
 Thank you very much. 
 No, just so we're clear. 
 N... No, I... I think we're clear. 
 In the meantime, Kendall and I will be back later. 
 Okay. Yeah? Yeah. 
 We need to stuff some f*cking raccoons up some guy's chimney. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay, son. I'll hang back. 
 Ah, just, uh, tell 'em I'm in the middle of a call and I'll be right in. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, sure, Dad. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. Hello, Kendall. 
 Uh, my dad's on his way. He... he had to make a call. 
 He had to make an important call? 
 That's like a 1987 power move, dude. 
 That's... exciting. What, are you like his sherpa now? 
 You're like the skull, like, tied to his belt? 
 'Cause I'm f*ckin' scared. 
 Yeah, well. 
 So you're gonna come in here with "Yeah, well," hmm? 
 With your whole face and everything. 
 And you're saying no to all my calls? 
 No, Ken, you're gonna have to give me something. 
 Tell me what the f*ck happened. 
 Yeah, just, um, I'm not sure our visions aligned in the end. 
 Yeah. f*ck you too. 
 That doesn't even mean anything. 
 How did he get at you? 
 I just reassessed. 
 There's a friend card here if you want to play it. 
 You know that, right? 
 There's a human thing standing in front of you. 
 You can talk to me. 
 We had the whole world in our hands and you f*cking walked, man. Why? 
 Yeah, I... I... I saw your plan and, uh... my dad's plan is better. 
 Uh-huh, f*ck you too, you pusillanimous piece of f*cking fool's gold, f*cking silver-spoon f*cking... asshole. 
 Yeah, take that f*cking call. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, okay. Yep. Yep, I got it. 
 Uh, he's not gonna make it. 
 He's got another pressing matter. 
 Oh, he's got a more pressing matter than us taking his empire off his hands? 
 Sir Sandy, look what the cat dragged in. 
 Hello. 
 Yup, so I guess, um, my Dad wanted me to ask is there any way through this, you know, uh, an asset-swap? 
 Something else, uh, an arrangement that leaves you happy and him in control? 
 As you know, our position is that we're really after the whole thing. 
 Right, then, uh, he wanted me to tell you to say, yeah, obviously our public line will be that we are considering the offer but it doesn't matter what you offer; 
 He'll never recommend this to the board. 
 You're gonna bleed cash. He's gonna bleed cash. 
 It will never end. 
 And maybe you'll kill him, but if you don't, he aims to kill you. 
 He will go bankrupt or go to jail before he lets you beat him. 
 He will kill you on the business and if that doesn't work, he will send people around. 
 He will send men to kill your pets and f*ck your wives, and it will never be over, so that's the message. 
 Good. 
 Well, let's move ahead with that process, shall we? 
 ♪ ♪ Yeah? 
 I'm ready. Let's get started. 
 It smells wrong, and they're hiding sh1t. 
 Oh... yeah? Dad. 
 This isn't the time to retreat. 
 I mean, it makes us look weak. 
 No, it makes us look ruthless. 
 Dad announces tomorrow, he announces me. 
 Unless... there is one other. 
 The compass points to Pennsylvania Avenue. 
 I have to start thinking about appointments. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 ♪ ♪ So, it was felt Sandy, Stewie, and Masbury Capital wouldn't proceed with their bid without you, but they have gone public with a bear hug. 
 You could stop it. Okay, yeah. 
 My dad wants me to do it. 
 Uh, I'll do it. 
 The first episode of this second season, it follows on like 36, 48 hours after the events of the first season. 
 And we were interested, how does it feel to wake up after what Kendall's gone through? 
 What does his face look like, what's his body look like? 
 What's he gonna say to people? 
 Now, Kendall, tell us what happened. 
 Why did you get involved? Why did you back out? 
 The long and the short of it is, I... saw their plan. 
 And my dad's plan was better. 
 The interest of the show is seeing these people go through their stuff. 
 And they go through quite a bit of stuff. 
 Ladies and gentlemen... the first f*cking thing my son's ever done right in his life. 
 In the scene where... 
 Logan talks about the future of the company... 
 We need to discuss this bear hug. 
 Stick, or sell? 
 People will have to decide whether they think he is setting the table for the discussion he has with his kids in a frank way. 
 Or if he's loading the dice. 
 Please, I want you to speak freely. 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law? Like? 
 Come on, we're all pals here. 
 Oh, yeah. Let's f*cking have it out. 
 I f*cking love money, but I'm really scared of you. 
 So... Mm. 
 Logan wants a family legacy. 
 When he looks at Roman, I don't think he sees it there tomorrow. 
 And his son has both betrayed him and also been in circumstances which make him seem like not a good candidate right now. 
 And Connor, I think he would laugh about. 
 So Shiv feels like, "Well that's what he's gonna do, right?" 
 It seemed obvious to us. 
 What I've decided I'd like to do, is to formally ask you to come in... and be the next chief executive of this company. 
 It nearly made my cry seeing Shiv sort of finally say what she has always wanted. 
 I think there's some things in life that you don't almost even know you want until you say it. 
 And then it can be quite powerful and overwhelming, the acceptance of it. 
 You wanna do it? 
 Yes? Yes! 
 f*ck! 
 All right. 
 Yes.
