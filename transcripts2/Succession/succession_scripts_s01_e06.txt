 There's a potential opportunity for some acquisitions. 
 Local TV? 
 No one watches TV, Dad. 
 Why shouldn't we do all the news? 
 Well, Kim Jong-Pop, because that's not how things work in this country. 
 It's really happening! We're getting married. 
 That is a very romantic way of looking at a prenup. 
 He's actually acting kind of strange. 
 Like inviting me to Thanksgiving? 
 Dad? 
 He kept pouring, and it just went everywhere. 
 It was like he didn't even see. Dad! Hey! Whoa! 
 All you have to do is do a little bit of shredding. 
 Don't make it a big deal. It's okay. It's a job. 
 Shooting bolts into cows' heads is a job, but I... I... 
 It's not how I wanna spend my Thanksgiving. 
 You just invited me into the chicken coop. 
 I'm gonna eat you all. One by f*cking one. 
 I wondered if you could do me a favor. 
 Well, that might cause some ethical issues, 'cause there's a world where my guy and your gal ends up wrestling for the Democratic nomination. 
 You lost, Grandpa. 
 Are you all right? 
 Take your hands off him, okay? 
 I've seen all I need to see. 
 So, are we doing this? Don't ask me. He's your father. 
 I'd be doing it for him. 
 This is f*cking impressive. You hooked this sh1t up, friend. 
 Hey, brother, I just wanna say you killed that sh1t. 
 My man. Absolutely killed that. For sure. 
 What's up, bro? Good to see you. 
 You're f*ckin' imperial right now, OK? 
 I think American Diablo is your best album. 
 Thanks, guys. Much obliged. 
 All right, man. All right... 
 Are we supposed to follow him? 
 What's gonna happen? Just be cool. 
 So, this guy's your boy, right? 
 Yeah. Hey, listen, can I talk to you about something? 
 Mm-mm, sure. Um... 
 Oh, here she comes. What's up? 
 So he's just decompressing, apparently, but he's really down to connect. 
 Oh, he's decompressing? What from his voyage to the bottom of the f*ckin' rap ocean? 
 His show was a shitty show. 
 But the label got a room for you guys. 
 Right here. I'm sorry, what's your name? 
 Jess. Jess. Sorry. 
 Can you just remind him he's the guy that owns the company that owns the company that owns the label that pays his f*cking ass? Absolutely. 
 Yeah, just don't say those words. 
 Oh, my gosh, look at this. 
 Shrimp. Huh? 
 Look at this. 
 Warmed in this airless box for like, what, let's say six hours? 
 And this goo? Is this delicious f*cking goo? 
 Look at that. Mmm! 
 So, listen, I need to say something, but once I've said it I'll have said it, and while it's not a big deal, it's delicate. 
 What is it? You f*cked the company? 
 I haven't f*cked the company. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Scientology? What is it? 
 Look, we're friends, we go back, I can trust you. 
 Right? 
 No. 
 Sure, but on money stuff, I can trust you? 
 No. 
 Because we're calling a vote of no confidence on my dad. 
 What the f*ck, man. 
 It's the best way forward right now. 
 This is f*cking terrible. 
 Bro, you're gonna f*ck the company. 
 You're f*cking with my money, Ken. 
 Look, I'm telling you, it's just cleanest. 
 He's lost it. 
 He's going to D.C. tomorrow to piss away our political capital and position us permanently in a dying sector. 
 Do you think you can win? Of course. 
 It's finished. I'm informing you, not courting you. 
 Because I have to work with whoever's left. 
 Right. With me. 
 So are we good? 
 Can I count on your vote for Team Future? 
 I can promise you that I am spiritually and emotionally and ethically and morally behind whoever wins. 
 What's the matter? 
 I'm pissed because I have to come down to him like a f*ckin' FedEx guy. Why can't he come to us? 
 Well, I guess he's the president. 
 f*ckin' Californian shrunken little raisin. 
 I've seen ten of 'em. 
 He's basically a f*ckin' intern. 
 Are you OK, Karl, on all this? 
 Yeah. Sure. Yeah. 
 On the law? Yeah. 
 Gerri walked me through it too, so... 
 I wish she was here and not you. 
 Well, thank you. 
 She has to stay in the city for board meeting prep, so... 
 It was a joke, Karl. 
 And I'm guessing if I say cortado with almond, you're gonna look like I'm some kind of jerk, right? 
 I will have a black coffee, please and thank you. 
 Is this safe? 
 I don't think we're gonna bump into anyone here. 
 So how'd it go with Stewy? 
 It went great. He's in. 
 OK. Well, that's great. 
 Yeah. So I think we're all good. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Shall I just... run it one more time before we open our kimonos in public? 
 Logan. 
 Once the vote is proposed, he's recused... out of the game. 
 So we have Kendall, Roman, Frank. Three votes in favor. 
 And Asha. Your pet. That's good? 
 Rock solid. Already floated and noted. 
 Right. 
 Paul, Dewi, Datu... 
 They're old guard, they'll go Logan. 
 Yeah, well, sure. I mean... but sure. 
 OK, Uncle Ewan, uh, he's still a possible, right? 
 Um, you could maybe stoke the old resentments? 
 Lady Macbeth, gettin' your little f*ckin' screwdriver in. 
 It's not a f*cking teddy bear's picnic, Roman, it's a massacre. Lawrence? 
 Dad would sell Vaulter for parts. 
 Lawrence would be crazy not to vote with me. 
 Except Lawrence hates you. 
 We have three for Logan, five against, three unknowns. 
 Come on, this is bullshit. Look, we push, Lawrence is ours, Ewan could be ours, Ilona could be ours. 
 Gerri can't vote, but she can talk for senior management. 
 This is done. There's being cautious, and there's being f*cking time-wasters. 
 If you want me to do this, you gotta look worst case. 
 Lawrence, Ewan, Ilona, all in play. 
 One more makes us sure winners. 
 Yeah. We, uh... we hit Lawrence. 
 I got the call. The nuclear reactor is sealed off. 
 The infected have been shot. Oh, that's great. 
 That's great. Thank you. 
 Yeah. Thank you so much. 
 We're good. OK. OK. 
 Goodbye. Bye. 
 Yeah. Goodbye forever. Hope so. 
 Three men to own half the wealth of America. 
 I have just been given the all-clear. 
 Ohh! I feel I can breathe again. 
 Honestly, honey, it's like this 900-pound gorilla has finally stopped f*cking me. 
 Now, is this the thing I don't want to know about? 
 Yeah. And it's gone. 
 Poof. 
 I think I'm good. I think I'm good. 
 Greg. Me. The circle's tight. 
 He's good. He's my little R2 unit. 
 I don't know. 
 Arrgh! I don't... This... I don't f*cking know! 
 Should I stick with her? 
 Is that a president? 
 Maybe. I don't know. 
 Now, not to be Groomzilla, but can we talk about menus? 
 'Cause I really, really love Lake Como, but I'm worried about the fog. 
 One thing is, people don't change. 
 You know, a candidate can't change. 
 You can primp and plump and repackage, but if you want to change someone fundamentally, forget it. So, should we go... very old New York classy? 
 Oh. Yeah. Uh, I... 
 Sorry, I had a pretty shitty phone call with my mom the other day, and just to smooth things over I said that we might have the wedding back in England. 
 You what? Yeah. 
 Is that a biggie for you? Excuse me, Shiv. f*ck. 
 Tom, it's just a wedding. The planners will figure it out. 
 "Just a wedding"? Shiv. Yeah. 
 It's our wedding! Oh, Tom... 
 It only happens once. I can't do this right now. 
 Tom. OK. No... 
 I'm trying to think about work. 
 And I'm looking forward to it, but I just can't get into it all, all the details. 
 I mean, the wedding might be in England, but it might not. 
 OK, OK, sorry, sorry. 
 So, I'll take Lawrence, and you firm up the others, yeah? 
 That's OK. I got him. 
 No, I know the guy. 
 I see him at every f*cking fakers party, phony soft opening that I go to. 
 We're like two peas in a metrosexual think pod. 
 Look, are we doing this? 
 Are we running a f*cking company together, or what? 
 Just 'cause I like a joke doesn't mean I'm a f*cking clown. 
 Look, Rome, I'm just trying to... 
 I got it. I know you're not a clown. 
 I'm not. It's delicate. 
 Oh, it's delicate? I didn't realize it was delicate, the little nuances. 
 Lawrence f*ckin' hates you, man, he does. 
 And he likes you? Yeah. 
 He likes me. People like me. 
 I look like a matador and everyone wants to f*ck me. 
 I see him around. I know the guy. 
 Trust me. OK. 
 Gerri says there are multiple indicators he wants to be sympathetic to our expansion. 
 You think so? 
 If he waves this through, he gets hundreds of local TV stations most amenable to talking about what a great f*ckin' guy he is. 
 He just needs to be prepared to take a little political heat is all. 
 Four more years, we're Proctor & Gamble of the news. 
 Hey. Tom. Uh, I'm heading to Washington. 
 Do you mind if I miss dinner? I need to figure out about Joyce. 
 No, sweetheart, that's fine. 
 If you need to think about your commitment to Joyce, then go, do it. Go to Washington. 
 Yeah, I just wondered if I picked the right horse. 
 No, I get it, I do. Yeah. 
 Slide her under the X-ray machine, baby. 
 OK. Love you. Bye. You, too. Bye. 
 Hey hey, guy. 
 Hey hey. 
 Hey. Everything OK, Greg? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure? 
 Good. 
 Good good. 
 You know, you can, uh, you can talk to me about anything. You know? 
 Oh, yeah. Well, I... Thanks. 
 Fantastic... resource. 
 OK, OK. 
 So, Shiv is going to Washington, so why don't, tonight, why don't I take you out? 
 No? 
 What, for real? 
 I thought you were gonna say 
 "take you out and beat the sh1t out of you," or "take you out and put a bullet through your dumb f*ckin' brain," or something else, you know, funny like that. 
 No, Greg, I'm not some beast. 
 Well, actually, I finally got paid... 
 Attaboy. OK. 
 It's like they're not paying the light bill here, but, um, but I actually got paid, and I was thinking about maybe going to, um, have you ever visited California Pizza Kitchen? 
 No. Dear Lord, no. 
 It's pretty delicious, Tom. 
 No. No, it isn't, Greg. 
 I mean, you might think it tastes delicious, but... 
 They make a Cajun chicken linguini just how I like it. 
 But that's not how you're supposed to like it. 
 OK, you probably have quite an undereducated palate. 
 So, let's go out, and I'll teach you. 
 And I'll show you how to be rich. OK? It'll be fun. 
 He'll be just along the hallway here, Mr. Roy. 
 I have been here before, and I do know how hallways work. 
 Someone will be with you shortly. 
 What a f*ckin' song and dance, eh? 
 Ah. Mr. Roy. I am so sorry, but the president passes on his sincere apologies. 
 He's currently dealing with a matter of homeland security. 
 He's sure you'll understand, but he's going to need to offer an alternative face for this discussion. 
 "Alternative face," what the f*ck does that mean? 
 If I drop my pants, I can show you an alternative face. 
 How does that sound? 
 Have I been snubbed? 
 Find out if I've been snubbed. 
 I don't think you've been snubbed. 
 Is this a snubbing?! Just f*cking find out! 
 Holy sh1t. Wamsgans! 
 A f*ckin' black eye? 
 You should see the other guy. 
 The guy who jammed his dick in your eye? 
 Let's just say, uh, I was in bed, with Shiv, so... 
 What? She punched you? 
 No. 
 Things just get a little hot and heavy. 
 A little freaky-deaky. So... 
 f*ckin' our sister? That's cool, man. 
 Yeah, it's kinda weird when you talk about that. 
 No, I think it's really cool. 
 Like, what's it like, like, to bang our sister? 
 So what's goin' on? Clue me in. 
 Uh, we just finished, bud. 
 Yup. Yeah, I'm gonna go, uh, eat a f*cking elk or something. 
 See ya later. 
 Oh, hey, Tom. 
 Just to say I know you've been eating a lot of sh1t for me that I don't know about, and I appreciate that. 
 I like you. 
 You're Team Kendall, man. 
 Lot of stuff goin' down, but you're on the team. 
 Thanks, brother. 
 Here's to us. 
 To us. 
 Uh, so I do need to ask something, but, um... we're cool, yeah? 
 Like, we're f*ckin' disruptors, Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 But, um... what would you say... what would you say if I told you that there was gonna be a vote of no confidence tomorrow? 
 Kick out the old man, in with the new guard. 
 Romey and the homey. 
 You and Kendall are thinking of killing your dad? 
 Well... That's a little Greek tragedy. 
 Yeah, Oedipus. 
 Did I say that I was going to f*ck Marcia? 
 No. Although I definitely would, 'cause she's hot. 
 But that's, you know, that's like phase two. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 Yeah, no. No worries. 
 This place has changed. 
 Uh... yeah. 
 I mean, well, e-everything changes. 
 We've changed. 
 What's this? Shiv Roy goes soulful. 
 Does not suit you. 
 It's like you're wearing a turtleneck and a stick-on mustache. 
 All right, yeah. 
 Well, I do have feelings. 
 So, uh, congratulations on Senator Miller. 
 Thank you. 
 Not exactly the f*ckin' Southern Strategy, gettin' a bunch of Jews, blacks, and media studies professors to vote in a Democrat in New York state, but still... 
 f*ck you. You've seen the numbers. 
 Yeah, there's a number of ways of analyzing the numbers. 
 I did a f*cking good job, in the teeth of a scandal. 
 At this point in the cycle, I knocked it out of the f*cking park. 
 So here's to me. 
 How's everything in the People's Republic of Gil Eavis? 
 Amazing. 
 So, go on, Shiv, what is this? 
 OK, uh, well... 
 I want you to think about joining us. 
 Me and Joyce. Why? 
 Because I need a piece of sh1t on the team. 
 What do you think? 
 Is it a good idea? You and me? 
 Uh, yeah. Why? Historically speaking, we found it quite hard not to f*ck each other. 
 It's great to see you... on such short notice. 
 Shush. Eat. 
 I finished most of 'em, Grandpa. 
 Your mother says you don't have any money. 
 Until recently, but actually, um, my pay came through. 
 And now I'm incredibly rich. 
 Really? Mm-hmm. 
 Well, uh, I'm sure you're going to be very happy. 
 Thank you. 
 She also told me to feed you, so eat up. 
 Whew. Honestly, I think my stomach might have shrunk during my... my period of poverty. 
 The waste in this city is obscene. 
 Finish it. 
 So, how come you're here... You're in town, uh, if I may ask? 
 Well... you're a grownup, allegedly. 
 So here's what grownups do. 
 Kendall is gonna call for a vote of no confidence against his own father at the next board meeting. 
 S-Sounds like a huge deal, but it's just procedure or... 
 It's a wanton act of egregious selfishness. 
 In keeping with everything else I've come to loathe about this rat's nest of a family. 
 Right. Right. 
 So are you gonna tell Logan? 
 I'm gonna keep my snout of the trough, thank you very much. 
 Paddle your own canoe. 
 Hmm? 
 Hello? 
 Kendall? 
 Marcia. 
 I was wondering, if you're not busy, if you don't mind joining your father for dinner? 
 Did he ask to have dinner with me? 
 Yeah. 
 He's home alone, and I have something I cannot miss. 
 Um... just him and me? 
 Yeah. Is it a bad time? 
 Do you have something planned? 
 Uh, no. Of course. 
 Um, no, I'm... I'm around. 
 Thank you. 
 I've left some steamed fish. 
 Merci beaucoup. 
 OK, su... 
 Mmm. Exactly. 
 When I had their monkfish, I thought I was gonna sh1t, puke and cum all at once. 
 That sounds... delicious. 
 Although I don't actually have much of an appetite. 
 Well, you better find one quick, 'cause this is one of the most exclusive popups in the city, and we're having the full tasting menu. 
 Uh-huh. 
 How come the... the wine list doesn't have any prices? 
 Because they're obscene. 
 Look, here's the thing about being rich, OK? 
 It's f*cking great. 
 OK? It's like being a superhero, only better. 
 You get to do what you want, the authorities can't really touch you, you get to wear a costume, but it's designed by Armani, and it doesn't make you look like a prick. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 If I was going to come in with you, what's your vision? 
 Well, it's me and Kendall. 
 f*ck Kendall. OK? 
 You. What's your vision? 
 You know what? 
 I ended up in a book shop the other day, and I just started laughing. 
 OK. 
 I was looking at all the books cramming up all the walls, and I just thought, you know, about the olden days, all the f*cking monasteries and the Bibles and the sermons and the "Did Jesus say this? And "Do you mean that?" and all the words and what have you. 
 All gone. 
 No one gives a f*ck. 
 You're saying we're going post-literate. 
 People are gonna read, but the old world, it's gone. 
 Papers, gone. News, gone. 
 "Tune in to ABS at nine to be told what to think." 
 No. Over. 
 It's all about the morsels, man. 
 Feed me the f*cking tasty morsels. 
 Keep me interested. That is where we're headed. 
 Tasty morsels from groovy hubs. 
 Tasty morsels... from groovy hubs. 
 Um, look, man, I'm dumb, but I'm smart. 
 I'm too dumb to know how to fix our whole company. I don't have the attention span. 
 This is probably the most interesting thing that's happened in my whole life, and I'm thinking about six other things. 
 But I am smart enough to know what needs changing, and I'm smart enough to spot the people who can help us, Lawrence. 
 So are you in? 
 Well... 
 I'm on the side of change. 
 Yeah, you are. 
 Sorry... Oh, f*ck. 
 Mind if I take this? 
 Go ahead. 
 Sorry, fellas. Keep it sexy. 
 Yeah? 
 Marcia asked me to have dinner with Dad. 
 He knows. Does he know? I don't know. 
 Did he mention me? 
 What did Lawrence say? 
 Uh, he's in. 
 For real? 
 Yes, for real. f*ck you. 
 Nice. OK. 
 OK, great. Thanks. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 What... What now? 
 Ortolan. What's ortolan? 
 It is a deep-fried songbird. You eat it whole. 
 Oh, my God... This is a rare privilege. 
 And it's also kind of illegal. 
 Oh, I have a... For the head. 
 The exact purpose is debated. 
 Some say it's to mask the shame; 
 Others, to heighten the pleasure. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That is so good. 
 Did you eat it yet, Greg? 
 Not yet, no. Eat it, Greg! 
 Um, it's a rather... unique flavor. 
 Yeah, it's the gamy, brainy hit, my friend. 
 Oh. 
 Can we have some more wine, please? 
 You trying to seduce me, Tom? 
 Yes, I am! Yes, I am, Greg. 
 All the things we've seen, all the things we've done... 
 We're in this together, man. 
 OK. Is that... 
 Is that what this is, this is about the thing? 
 We have a bond. 
 You do? Yeah, sure. 
 I was an outsider once. 
 Young guy from St. Paul, alone in the big city, and it was hard. 
 And you create this kind of protective shell, but underneath, we're all just little... nudie turtles. 
 OK. 
 I gotta level with you, because if I eat any more songbirds, I'm gonna hurl. 
 My grandpa already bought me dinner tonight. 
 Your grandpa? What's he doing in New York? 
 He's come down for this vote of no confidence in Logan tomorrow. 
 Did you know about that? 
 What? You serious? 
 Yeah, he's come down especially to vote. 
 It's a big deal, right? 
 Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. 
 You say you want me... but really, you don't. 
 It's so exciting when you know more about me than I do. 
 You want me for my edge, 'cause she's not edgy enough. 
 You should be workin' for a winner like Gil. 
 You know I'm a considerably more successful political strategist than you are. 
 Shiv, you work with what you got, and what you got is... bleachh. 
 I've been grooming Joyce for three years. 
 Appeals to everyone. Exactly. 
 Which is a little like appealing to no one. She's nice. 
 That is a horrible thing to say about anyone. 
 Look, Kendall told me how you're marrying this... guy, this corn-fed basic from hockey town. 
 Yeah, Tom. He's a great guy. Sure. 
 Great guy with the square head. 
 And you're workin' for the nice black lady. 
 What are you trying to prove? You're such a f*cking prick. 
 You should be with an exciting b*st*rd like me. 
 I tried playing with you, and you broke. 
 Sir. Your father's on a call in the den. 
 He asked if you'd wait a moment. 
 Oh, sure. 
 Tom? Uh, hey, can this wait till tomorrow? 
 You're gonna want to hear this. Ewan is in town, and he knows, and he's come to vote. 
 What? Hold... Hold on. 
 Who's your source? 
 Uh, I can't reveal my sources. 
 But it's Greg. 
 OK. Uh, Tom, you do not breathe a word of this, OK? 
 My lips are sealed. 
 All right. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. 
 It's not a big deal. Team Kendall. 
 My God. My God! It's actually happening. 
 It's happening. 
 The troops are taking Saddam's palace, man. 
 This time tomorrow, you and me... 
 I could... I could be like the... 
 I could be like the third most important guy in the company. 
 I mean, it's the storming of the Bastille. 
 Let us eat cake. I mean... 
 I don't know what we're talking about. 
 Thanks, Richard. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Hey. 
 You shouldn't eat this sh1t. 
 You're not the boss of me. 
 Did you want to talk? Marcia said you... wanted to see me. 
 Marcia. 
 Yeah, she's got her own game goin' on. 
 What does that mean? 
 You know what it means. 
 You've got your game goin' on. 
 I've got my game. 
 What... What's, uh, what's your game? 
 Everybody's got a game. 
 So what's goin' on? 
 What's the action? What's the story? 
 What's goin' on? 
 You heard about my meet? 
 You heard it was a snub? 
 What? Uh... Oh. 
 Yeah, I heard, um... 
 Uh, I heard real security alert, but who knows, it's tough to read. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 I could do something about this. 
 OK? 
 Haven't had one of these in, uh... 
 I don't even know. 
 You gonna eat it? 
 Yeah, I'm gonna eat it. 
 Hey, good. 
 Cheers. Cheers. 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 Every f*ckin' time! 
 Thanks, man. Thanks. 
 Should I get us some beers? 
 No, no. No need. Bottle service. I ordered vodka. 
 Come on. 
 Whoa! Go ahead, man. 
 Hey! So this is what you do? 
 You, like, go to a club, and then you come to, like, this other part where the club sort of isn't? 
 Yeah! Yeah, that's it! 
 This is 2,000 bucks a pop. 
 Why? 
 No reason! We're being totally ripped off! 
 Is this gold... Is this gold leaf? 
 Uh-huh. Drink the gold, my friend. 
 And then later you and I can have a 24-karat piss. 
 Any news? 
 Um, we have Lawrence. 
 That'll make our sleep easier. 
 If I can sleep. Which I won't. 
 I think I'm just gonna call Sarita and check Ilona's out of the action. 
 Oh, do we need? 
 You're not worried that could stir things? 
 Just to cover all the bases. 
 Hey, Frank? 
 Listen, is... is this... 
 Is this, like, objectively... horrible? 
 You know, w-we could hold off. 
 We could put this together next quarter... 
 Ken. You made this happen. 
 It's hard enough to get five people together for a f*ckin' dinner. 
 You might never get another shot. 
 And it's the right thing to do. 
 Strength. 
 You're a good son. 
 Night, Ken. 
 Goodnight. 
 Hello? Sarita, hey. 
 Sorry to call so late. I... 
 You know, I was just, uh, thinking, and... and... 
 It's nice to hear your voice. 
 Yeah, it's nice to hear your voice. 
 I don't know, I felt bad, and I wanted to check in... on your mom. 
 Uh, I assume she can't make it to the board meeting tomorrow, sadly. 
 No. I have to go, Kendall. 
 So, tell me more about Mr. Potato Head. 
 Tom? 
 He's a... He's amazing. 
 Well, I'm pleased. 
 Uh, but... It is great. Shiv. 
 You're convincing me. You are. 
 It's the constant sort of... weary repetition. 
 "Tom's great." He is. 
 We're not gonna f*ck tonight, right? 
 You know I'm getting married, too. 
 Oh, really. 
 Car model or failed actress? 
 Ouch. There she is. 
 She's actually a French doctor. 
 That's nice. 
 I mean, it doesn't mean we can't do other stuff. 
 Uh... Theoretically. 
 I'm getting married in March. 
 I'm getting married in May. 
 It's not a competition. Sure. Yeah. 
 But only one of us is getting married in lilac season, and it's not you. 
 Come on. What? 
 I have to say I am feeling... 
 You're feeling what, Nate? 
 I mean, we could m*st*rb*t* in separate rooms. 
 Oh, God! No. It's quite modern. 
 No. Come on! Or... Or... 
 Just, for old times' sake, last one. 
 Absolute last one. 
 I could just, you know, the old traditional... simply... stick it in. 
 Yeah. Like a gas station, right? 
 Just stick it in. 
 So a French doctor, huh? 
 She sounds far too nice and interesting for you. 
 She's not that nice. 
 Deep down she's... statusand money-obsessed. Like you. 
 This is nice. 
 This is like being friends. 
 You know. 
 It was Gil. 
 He's very interested. 
 I think you should do this. 
 You're hot, you're... so hot right now. 
 Come on. Nate. 
 We should be good people. 
 Uh, I know. 
 Wouldn't it be nice to just wake up in the morning and... 
 not feel like a f*cking piece of sh1t? 
 Hey, Shiv. Morning. 
 You know you're amazing, right? 
 
 
 
 Uh, yeah. I guess. 
 Come meet Gil. 
 He's not a pipe dream. He's gonna go all the way. 
 OK. 
 So, we behaved ourselves. 
 They're gonna write songs about how good we were. 
 Shiv? You're a blonde beast. 
 You should do whatever you want. 
 Bye, Nate. 
 I think it's gonna be tight, but, uh... you know, all the variables swing our way. 
 Huh. 
 Whup. 
 Hey, what's up, Jess? 
 I have Ms. Shinoya on the line. 
 OK. 
 Sarita? 
 Hello? 
 Ilona. Ilona, hi. How are you? 
 God, it's great to hear your voice. 
 Y-You're up. Um, did... did you get my gift? 
 Yes. So, my daughter told me you don't want me voting in today's board meeting. Is that right? 
 No, no, no. That's... That's not it at all. 
 That's, um... 
 C-Can I explain? That's... 
 Well, I'm letting you know that I will be dialing in. 
 O-OK. Well, look, there's some issues. 
 I know you haven't... 
 Look, could I... Could I come and talk it through? 
 Kendall, I will be dialing in. 
 I'll be there in an hour. 
 Great. OK, thanks, Ilona. 
 You're gonna go all the way out to her? To Long Island? 
 Yeah, I can... Is there time? 
 I can make it. I can make it. 
 I think... 
 I think I have to go. 
 Hey. You ready? Let's go. 
 Sorry, Mr. Roy, the skies are closed. 
 Temporary flight restriction. There's a possible terror threat. 
 No, no, I need to go, pal. I'll pay whatever fine they hit us with. Let's go. 
 We can't do that, sir. FAA will pull my license. 
 Uh, OK, I'll handle the FAA. 
 Or... What is it? The AHS? I'll handle it. 
 Whatever you lose financially, I'll make up in perpetuity. OK? 
 Sir, if we take off now, we can be shot down by an F-16. 
 Yeah, but not really. Right? 
 Airspace is on lockdown. 
 There's nothing we can do. 
 Whoa whoa! 
 Yo! 
 How long to get to the city? Financial district? 
 Man, we should get a round of f*ckin' shots going, right? 
 Make it happen. 
 Will do. 
 It's nice to see the war criminal. Cleans up well. 
 Yeah, nice guy, lovely guy. 
 Whoo. 
 We good, then? Solid? Right? 
 I heard Logan started on time even when he was airlifted in from Aspen with a shattered femur. 
 That is true. 
 Yep, no. 
 That is correct. 
 Hey, is your phone working? 
 C-C-Can I get like a motorcycle courier? 
 Anything? Can you call your office? 
 Sorry, no bars. 
 They're evacuating five blocks each way from the Stock Exchange. 
 Lower Manhattan. NYPD has shut down the West Side Highway... Gerri. Can you hear me? 
 Hey, where are you? 
 Hey, listen, I'm... I'm... 
 I'm almost there. 
 The traffic's stopped. I need you to stall. 
 What? What's that? 
 It's a bad connection. 
 I can't really hear you. 
 Gerri? 
 I'm in a tunnel. 
 OK? Stall. 
 Well, how far are y... 
 Uh, I... 
 sh1t. 
 What? 
 He's in traffic. 
 Don't. Don't do this. 
 He's asking us how long can we stall. 
 f*ck, f*ck, f*ck. Great. 
 Oh. 
 It'll be all right. He's not gonna be too late. 
 Here he comes. Morning, morning. 
 Good morning. 
 Oh! Quite a turnout. Yeah. 
 Frank, will you whip us through? 
 Uh, I... I just got word. I think Kendall will be a few minutes late. 
 Request for a late start? 
 No! No? 
 He can catch up. f*ck that! Where is he? 
 Stuck in traffic. That's all I know. 
 OK, come on, come on, let's go. Let's go. 
 Yup, yup. 
 It's twelve noon, and I'd like to call the meeting of Waystar Royco to order. 
 Roll call. What...? Roll call? 
 Logan Roy. Yeah. You're here. 
 We've never done roll call. What is roll call? 
 We're doing it today. Why are we doing roll call? 
 Because that's how we do it. Right, Noah? 
 So Logan Roy is here... Huh. 
 Frank Vernon, present. 
 Kendall Roy, absent. 
 Roman Roy. Yo. 
 Ewan Roy, absent. 
 Ilona Shinoy, absent. 
 Datu Kassma. Present. 
 Dewi Swann. Here. 
 Paul Chambers. Happy to be here. 
 Asha Kahn. Here. 
 Lawrence Yee. Here. 
 Sir! 
 Stewy Hosseini. I am here. 
 Mr. Chairman, we have a quorum. 
 Uh, we also welcome our esteemed general counsel Gerri Killman to the meeting. Thanks, Gerri. 
 So everybody has a copy of the agenda and the minutes of the last meeting. 
 Is that right? Yes. 
 Do any of you have any questions that have come to you immediately after looking at them? 
 I know that I-I have a few thoughts... we might have to take a look at. 
 What thoughts? 
 Just wait a second and I'll get to it. 
 OK. Who's this? 
 Ewan? Well... you just can't keep away, huh? 
 Thought maybe I'd show up for once. 
 Watch the fun. 
 Great to have you. 
 They wouldn't let me in downstairs without a passport. 
 Has it started? 
 Kendall. Hey, where are ya? 
 We've already started, man. 
 We've started. 
 Hey. Tell Jess to put me through the polycom. Yeah? 
 So, let's move along to item 3.1. 
 Frank. Mm-hmm? 
 What's "Performance issues?" Sounds f*cking vague. 
 And why is it so high on the f*ckin' hit parade? 
 I don't know if we're actually gonna hit those today. Maybe we can bump those. 
 Sorry, I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
 Can we bump 'em? 
 OK, then. Let's bump it. 
 Ohh. What the f*ck's goin' on? 
 I think Kendall wants to make a comment. 
 He has a... a thing that he's going to speak... 
 I think Ilona is going to phone in, too. 
 He's on the line. I'm putting him through. 
 What is this? What the f*ck is this? 
 Hi, Kendall? 
 Hey, guys. Can you hear me? 
 I apologize. 
 I will be there shortly. 
 Where are we at? 
 We are at your item. 
 Performance issues. 
 Uh... You want us to wait? 
 Where are you? 
 f*ck that. We're movin' on. 
 Gerri, Noah, if we wanted to halt proceedings until... 
 We're not halting proceedings. 
 We're moving on. No, no. It's OK. It's OK. 
 I can do this. 
 Dad, this is big. 
 Look... 
 I love my father. 
 OK? My father is a legend. 
 I worship the ground he walks on. 
 Nothing will ever detract from what he's built and what he's done. 
 But he is currently unfit to run this company. 
 Speak up. I can't hear. 
 Not only because of his refusal to take the time to recover from serious health issues, but because every day he refuses to retire, he is one day closer to destroying his own legacy. 
 He took on levels of debt that threatened the very existence of our firm, he is lining up dead-weight acquisitions in a sector that he has a historic regard for but which is a non-growth area. 
 We face existential battles in scale, and he is facing precisely the wrong direction. 
 He is making decisions for a future that he no longer understands, and we don't have time for missteps. 
 What used to take ten... Two, three years. 
 Our entire ice cap will melt. 
 He is gambling our last dollars at the track on a horse that's ready for the glue factory, and I am calling for a vote of no confidence in him as CEO and chairman. 
 Bullshit. No. 
 I'm afraid since you are the subject of the vote, you need to recuse yourself, Logan. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ. f*ckin' amateur hour at the f*ckin' circus. 
 You don't get to vote, and you don't get to comment, is the situation. 
 You really should leave the room. 
 OK, fine. Fine. Vote. 
 Would you mind? 
 Guys. Is he there? 
 Is he still in the room? 
 I'm sick. I can't move. f*ck that vote. 
 He can't be in the room. OK? Guys... 
 Let the minutes reflect that Logan Roy was asked to recuse himself. 
 Let the minutes reflect that Logan Roy shoved his boot up Frank's ass. 
 OK. 
 All in favor of the vote of no confidence in Logan Roy? 
 Me. My hand is raised. 
 More in sorrow than in anger. 
 Oh, no sh1t, Judas. 
 Frank! 
 Nice to see you back. 
 Asha? 
 I see you. 
 And I see you, Logan. 
 Oh, Jesus, this is just un-frickin'-believable. 
 Stewy? Stewy. 
 Me. OK. 
 Listen, as a major shareholder, and in the absence of any real clarity here, I think it's the view that this is a family matter and abstain. 
 Against. Strongly against. 
 We have Ilona on the line. 
 Hello, Logan. Yes. 
 After consulting with my family, I am voting in favor of the motion. 
 Thanks for nothin', Ilona. 
 f*ck off. 
 Ewan? 
 Go ahead. 
 What are we on, 4-2? 
 Go on. 
 Yeah. Join the rats. 
 Let's finish this, huh? 
 I vote with Logan. 
 I think we should take the time to consider this properly when all parties are here. 
 Datu, we're voting now. 
 Logan, please, can you stay out of the conversation? 
 In which case, Logan. I stick with Logan. 
 Kendall, you counted right there? 
 You all right? 
 Four against four, this is your best shot? 
 Lawrence? 
 I don't have a dog in this fight, Kendall. 
 I abstain. 
 So, currently we've got four votes in favor of Logan to remain, four of stepping down, two abstentions. 
 Uh, Gerri. 
 Do you want to say anything to speak to the senior management teams' attitudes here? 
 Shut the... Well, you know, I'm an independent observer, non-voting, a general counsel, so I'm not sure that's appropriate? 
 Right. Thanks. 
 Very... professional. 
 Hey, Roman? 
 Roman. 
 Put your hand up, bro. 
 Roman, can you hear me? 
 Uh... Is your hand up? 
 Kendall, yeah. Hey. Are you there? 
 Roman... 
 Uh, you're kind of cuttin' out. 
 Roman... 
 He's off the line. 
 Come on, son. 
 Roman. 
 Come on. Come on, come on. 
 You better be smelling your f*ckin' armpit, Romulus. 
 Um... 
 I think it's a tough one, you know? 
 I think, uh... 
 It's tough, but maybe... Roman for me. 
 I'm not sure we can count that for you. 
 Roman? Against. 
 He s-started to vote, I'm not sure he can change that. 
 He can f*cking change. You shouldn't be here, you shouldn't be speaking here, you should be out of this room. 
 This is illegal. Whatever. 
 If you count 'em out, deadlock. 
 Continuity prevails. I'm chairman. 
 Casting vote. I win. It's f*cking over! 
 What's the vote? 
 My son. 
 That was your best shot. 
 You lost. 
 I think there's some doubt as to whether he lost... 
 And Kendall, Frank, Asha, Ilona, off the board, fired with immediate effect. 
 I don't think you're able to do that. 
 Security! 
 I am in the middle of turning a f*cking tanker. 
 Frank, you're fired. I have some doubt... 
 I'm in the middle of turning a f*cking tanker! 
 Do you hear?! 
 Frank! You're fired. 
 Without exit package. 
 Asha, goodbye. 
 Somebody send a telegram to Ilona telling her she's no longer required, and my best to her cancer. 
 I think we all need to take a beat. 
 Meh meh meh f*ckin' meh. Logan, stop. 
 Is it wise to fire the board with the share price this weak, heading into a political fight? 
 Take it like a f*cking man. You're out. 
 You're f*cked. You tried to kill me, but you failed. 
 And you're dead. Now f*ck off! 
 Oh, go on, cry me a river. 
 Get the f*ck out. 
 Straight out! Passes canceled. 
 We'll send along personal belongings. 
 Just need to get some things, OK? 
 No goodbyes! Thank you! 
 Get your f*ckin' hands off me. 
 And what the f*ck am I gonna do with you? 
 I don't know, Dad. 
 Jesus. 
 Can I just get some stuff? No. No. 
 Thank you. OK. 
 He-e-ey! 
 God, that was the journey from hell. 
 Spent 30 minutes in a cab not moving. 
 Honey? 
 Tom? 
 Hey. Hey. Hey. You OK, sweetheart? 
 Yeah. I think somebody poisoned me. 
 I'm working from home. 
 Oh, someone poisoned you? 
 Hmm. Oh! With booze? 
 Hmm. Hmm. 
 Aw. 
 Hey. Hey. Hey. 
 Mm. 
 OK, I got you something. 
 Oh, thank you. I missed you. 
 You only been away, like, 14 hours. 
 Yeah, well, sorry for missing you. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. What? 
 What the f*ck? 
 What? What's happened? 
 Well, more. T-Tell me more. 
 What's happened? Did it happen? 
 OK, call me right back. 
 The world's blown up. 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 What do you mean, "has it happened"? 
 Did you know? What? No! 
 f*ckin' Kendall! Has it happened? 
 Did... Has it happened? 
 Wait! 
 Kendall? Call me back. 
 You knew? Yeah. 
 I think too much "abolgoll" hurt my tummy. 
 Connor. You heard? 
 Yeah, Kendall called for a vote of no confidence on Dad. 
 Kendall? Who the f*ck else knew about this? 
 Roman did. Roman knew? 
 I don't know why you'd expect anything different. 
 Not a single one of them told me about this. It's complete bullshit. 
 Oh, Shiv, you know I don't like to take sides. 
 But I'm on your side. 
 f*ck you. 
 You knew? Yeah, I tried to call you. 
 Not hard enough. I did! 
 He's fired half the board. What about Kendall? 
 Fired. Frank, Asha, fired. What? 
 The rebels are getting shot in the town square. 
 I'll talk to you later, Tom. 
 Are we the rebels? 
 Yes? I have the White House. 
 The president will join once you're on. 
 They're very apologetic. 
 Tell him I'm on. Yes, sir. 
 Yes, he's on. 
 Hello, Mr. President. He'll be with you momentarily. 
 He'll be right there. 
 Thank you. 
 Mr. President. 
 Oh, much, much better. 
 No need for an apology. 
 Well, you really had a terrorist problem. 
 I've just taken down a terrorist myself.
