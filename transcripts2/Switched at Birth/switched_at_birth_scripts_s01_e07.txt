 Previously on Switched at Birth... 
 I thought you might like to know that this Bruce is quite a player. 
 "Love songs for Regina. " 
 It's Daphne's birth certificate. 
 "Angelo Sorrento. " 
 Angelo Sorrento's my dad. 
 I'm Angelo Sorrento's daughter. 
 The hospital just withdrew their offer. 
 They want to go to trial. 
 Why would they do that? 
 They found something. 
 Something that they can use against us. 
 Full house, queens over eights. 
 Hey, I'll add it to your tab. 
 We're stealing a test. 
 Are you wussing out on me? 
 If you had my 10 grand, you wouldn't have to do this, but you don't. 
 Toby, if you take the last lemon square, I will shave off your eyebrows in your sleep. 
 Halfsies? 
 Then I'll just shave one. 
 Daphne, look. 
 Are you asking me to make coffee? 
 Yes. 
 No? 
 Close. 
 This is "Make coffee. " 
 What was I saying? 
 You're asking me to make out. 
 Oh, okay. 
 There's a couple girls at school I'd like to make some coffee with. 
 Just make sure you use a coffee filter. 
 Oh! 
 What's this about a stolen test? 
 What test? 
 Kathryn, did you get this e-mail? 
 Kathryn: - No. 
 A chemistry test was stolen off some teacher's desk. 
 Seriously? 
 Do they know who did it? 
 Appaently whoever stole it, sold it other kids for a lot of money. 
 How much did they pay? 
 Does that really matter? 
 Just curious. 
 Toby, you were studying for a chem test, weren't you? 
 Yeah, that was yesterday. 
 It says here we're supposed to talk to our kids about cheating. 
 Cheating bad, studying good. 
 Good talk, mom. 
 It is when the other option is expulsion. 
 I'm going upstairs. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Hey, Daphne, wanna teach me how to sign more dirty words upstairs? 
 Sure. 
 Honey, I just mixed up my signs. 
 I asked our daughter to make out. 
 I'll make out with you. 
 You stole the test? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Last week you accosted me for money, and then I saw you talking all conspiratorial-like to Wilke. 
 That's a pretty big leap to assume that I stole the test. 
 You stole the test? 
 Hey, Daphne, why don't you speak a little louder? 
 I don't think they can hear you in East Riverside. 
 Oh, wow wow wow wow! 
 You did it. 
 I owed Wilke a lot of money, money that we earned selling the test. 
 Now I don't owe Wilke money anymore. 
 Oh, that's great. That shows real initiative. 
 You gonna open with that when you tell dad you're suspended? 
 I'm not getting suspended. 
 You're not confessing to the principal? 
 No way. He's bluffing. He has no idea who did it. 
 Toby, if he didn't know anything, he wouldn't have sent the e-mail. 
 Come on, don't be stupid. 
 I got this, okay? 
 If you get expelled, you can kiss college goodbye. 
 You and Adriana can be roomies in the guest house till you're 35. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Do? 
 Oh, we're not gonna do anything. 
 Whatever Toby did, it's done. 
 You know, staring at that phone's not gonna make it ring. 
 Dale's my only contact on the hospital board, and he is not returning my phone calls. 
 How many times have you called him? 
 Eight. 
 No wonder the hospital withdrew their offer. 
 You're a phone stalker. 
 You know, if the hospital board's dug up some deep dark secret on the Kennish family, I would like to know what that is. 
 Okay, what could it be? 
 I shoplifted once when I was 12, and I fall asleep when I'm at church. 
 And you're sure it's nothing bigger? 
 What about you? Are you sure? 
 What? 
 Any dark secrets that I should know about? 
 None that you should know about. 
 You realize that doesn't sound as reassuring as you thought it would. 
 You know what I cannot believe? I cannot believe we are walking into a courtroom I have no idea what that board's gonna throw at us. 
 I hate this. 
 This lawsuit is not only making me doubt you, it's making me doubt myself. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm calling Dale. Maybe he'll pick up my call. 
 What? 
 I think you should tell the principal about stealing the test. 
 Yeah, got it, thanks. 
 I'm just trying to help, but don't know how. 
 I'm sorry. I've never been in a situation like this. 
 You think I have? 
 I meant with a brother. 
 Yeah, great example I'm setting for you. 
 I didn't mean to drag you into this. 
 I should have never taken you to poker. 
 I'm just worried about you. 
 Well, don't. Wilke and I will figure something out. 
 It's all gonna be fine. 
 So word is Anna Mastro caught her daughter with a stolen copy of the test. 
 Clover? 
 She bought one? 
 Mm-hmm, paid a thousand dollars. 
 Okay, a thousand dollars for a test. 
 Have you met Clover? It was money well spent. 
 Not if she's expelled. 
 Oh, lord, what if Chad and James got expelled and ended up home all the time? 
 Though it is something else I could blame on Bruce and the divorce. 
 What? 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Is she still seeing him? 
 Regina? I have no idea. 
 You don't talk about it? 
 You know, she knows how I feel about Bruce. 
 So what else does Kathryn say about me? 
 I should not be telling you this. 
 No, come on. 
 So I'm a player, a cheat, a liar. 
 Did she tell you I like to kick puppies, too? 
 I don't care what Kathryn thinks, and I am not a dog person. 
 I just want to know how bad the stories have to get before you dump me. 
 Considering our relationship doesn't extend outside dark restaurants and this bedroom, I'd say pretty bad. 
 No no no, stay, stay, stay, don't go. 
 Is this the part where you pull me back to bed and say "Stay forever"? 
 And give you another thing to laugh at me about? 
 I don't think so. Stay, come on. 
 I can't do that. 
 Let's go to your place. 
 We can't do that, either. 
 Because of Kathryn. 
 Because of Daphne. 
 Pero tu me gusta, Regina Vasquez. 
 I do. 
 I really do. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Let me test the waters. 
 Okay. 
 Regina Vasquez. 
 Wait. 
 I think I found My dad. 
 Was that right? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah, and right age. 
 He works at a club near East Riverside. 
 It's gotta be him. And... 
 We look alike, right? 
 You're acting excited. Yay for excited. Me too. 
 I know that sign. 
 Tonight. Yeah, he's working tonight. 
 The club opens at 9:00. 
 Tonight? 
 So do I just walk in and say, "Hey, I'm your daughter," 
 "but not the deaf one that you abandoned all those years ago"? 
 I mean, what am I supposed to say? 
 He's gonna think I'm crazy. 
 You think? 
 Is that the sign for love? 
 Oh, how cute. 
 I didn't know you were coming over. 
 Actually, I asked him. 
 Asked him for what? 
 You remember that picture you gave me of Regina in front of a car? 
 Well, you could see the license plate, and Emmett was helping me track down the owner. 
 It was an accident, we met at Buckner. I saw him. 
 This is totally my fault. 
 If you're gonna get mad at anyone, get mad at me. 
 I think I found my dad. 
 If that matters at all, if you're curious. 
 Does he look familiar? Is that him? 
 I have no idea. 
 Go talk to her. 
 Regina's not home yet. 
 Hello, Kathryn. 
 And you just missed Denise. 
 I never miss Denise. 
 Do you know what time Regina usually gets back? 
 Did you try calling her? 
 I was hoping to surprise her. 
 Oh, in my experience, Regina doesn't like surprises. 
 Is that a relationship tip? 
 Would you like to wait inside? 
 That'd be a little weird. 
 Can you just do me a favor and see that she gets this? 
 At least it's not a thong. 
 She left it at my house, and I was hoping to use it as an excuse to see her. 
 Well, instead you got me. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Tell John I said hello, please. 
 Will do. 
 What if Regina's right? What if he is a jackass? 
 How much longer do we have to wait for Daphne? 
 You really think she's coming? 
 It's the tape that we found with Regina's stuff. 
 It's kind of groovy, right? 
 Those are animal noises. 
 Birds. 
 That's right, get down. 
 Oh, no no no, don't stop. 
 I love this song. 
 I used to dance to it, too. 
 No no no, keep dancing. 
 Please, I'll go. 
 Goodbye. 
 Honey, dinner's almost ready. 
 Not hungry. 
 Do you want me to bring you a plate? Toby! 
 Is this about your band or a girl? 
 No. 
 Toby. 
 Mom, there's nothing wrong. 
 Is this about the e-mail that was sent around? 
 Do you know who stole that test? 
 No. 
 Well, I know something is wrong. 
 Come on, tell me, Toby. 
 I can't tell you. 
 You can tell me anything. 
 Dad's gonna kill me. 
 Hey, mom. 
 Hi. 
 Did you know that Bay is looking for dad? 
 She's stubborn. 
 I'm stubborn. I should have known better. 
 She thinks she found him. 
 Are they in touch? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, he's a man who's very good at staying lost. 
 Did he leave because I'm deaf? 
 What? No. 
 But he left right after I became deaf. 
 Is that a coincidence? 
 He left because... 
 You know what? 
 I'm not talking about this, okay? 
 Opinion, please. Hmm? 
 Like it? 
 I think I'm starting to like Bruce and, you know, I was wondering how you would feel if he came over for dinner sometime. 
 I need you to answer me. 
 He left because he was too weak and scared to be a part of a real family. 
 He missed out on the greatest kid in the world. 
 And if he saw you, he would know that. 
 He's right. I am gonna kill him. 
 What the hell was he thinking? 
 He owed Wilke all that money. 
 Wilke, god. He told me he took care of that. 
 Wait a minute. You knew about this and you didn't tell me? 
 I didn't want you to get upset. 
 You don't have to protect me. 
 He's my son, too. What happened? 
 I offered him money. He didn't take it. 
 How did you offer him money? 
 I opened my checkbook. 
 Did you yell at him? 
 No, you know what? And I should have. 
 What did you say to him to make him not take the money? 
 Kathryn, I was not hard on him, and you know what? I should have been. 
 I should have brought the hammer down right there. 
 'Cause you know what? This kid doesn't think there are consequences to anything, because we keep saving him. 
 Do you think this is 'cause we've been focusing on the girls so much? 
 This has nothing to do with the girls. 
 Even if it were then, that would not be an excuse. 
 Okay? Stop letting him off the hook. 
 I know. 
 What the hell was he thinking? 
 Okay. 
 Okay what? 
 Okay, I wanna go. 
 So what's his name? 
 Angelo Sorrento. 
 You really didn't know his name. 
 I can't promise to be nice to him. 
 That is okay with me. 
 So how are we getting there? 
 You have a sidecar so we can fit in a third? 
 Why make a joke die twice? No. 
 You know what? We'll take Toby's car. 
 What did he say? 
 He's calling shotgun. 
 Good thing we skipped dinner because it would be coming up right about now. 
 Are you nervous? 
 Aren't you? 
 No, not really. 
 Oh, thursdays are latin heat. 
 You should really tell your grandmother. 
 So how do we get in? 
 We could try the door. 
 And... 
 Yeah? 
 
 
 
 Hello, cool sexy bar lady. 
 We're not open right now. 
 I'll wait. 
 I'm not exactly sure. 
 He left his retainer here last week. 
 Lost and found's in the coat check. 
 Did you say "left his retainer"? 
 I'm nervous, okay? 
 Hey, dad. 
 Not now. 
 I wanted to explain. 
 Toby, this is not a good time. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't even look at you right now. 
 Here. If you don't find it, I've got three more boxes back there. 
 Could I use your restroom? 
 It's through the bar. 
 Could I take her with me? 
 I really don't care. 
 Okay. 
 I don't see him. Do you? 
 Over there. 
 Is that him? 
 I don't know. Is it? 
 You've met him. 
 I was two. 
 So what do we do now? 
 Go talk to him. 
 This is stupid. We should just go. 
 What are you talking about? Go talk to him. 
 I- I can't. 
 Will you do it? 
 Denise. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Chad bought one of those tests. 
 He split the cost with James. 
 That's what I get for teaching my sons to share. 
 Oh, no. I am so sorry. 
 I know. You think you know your kids. 
 I mean, I'm telling you. 
 What do you mean by that? 
 After everything you've been through, with the switch thing. 
 Oh. 
 Let's take the frustration out on the tennis courts. 
 I really don't think so. I ate dinner already. 
 Did I leave this here? 
 Is that your earring? 
 Yeah, it was a gift from my sister. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Who else would it belong to? 
 Do you think you might have left it at Bruce's when you were dropping the kids off? 
 If I left it at Bruce's, it wasn't because I was dropping off the kids. 
 So you and Bruce are getting back together again? 
 God, no, but every now and then, we like to forget we're divorced. 
 Do you think he told Regina that? 
 I'm guessing no. It is Bruce, after all. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Are you Angelo Sorrento? 
 I am. 
 Do you remember a woman named Regina Vasquez? 
 I'm not sure. 
 You left her, and you left me. 
 You just took off one day and we never heard from you again. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Did you ever wonder about me or care how I was doing? 
 Because I wondered about you a lot. 
 Wondered what, honey? I don't know what... 
 I used to think that it was because of me, because I was damaged Or different, but it was you. 
 You're the one with the problem. 
 Hi, I'm Bay Kennish. 
 Don't bother. This guy's an ass. 
 I'm sorry. She has an axe to grind with you for obvious reasons. 
 He doesn't remember our mother. 
 You don't remember Regina? 
 Okay. 
 I don't know who that is. 
 And I have no idea who you are. 
 Look at me, think. 
 I know it was a long time ago, but big clue, I'm deaf. 
 And I'm looking for my father. 
 I'm not here to yell at you or blame you for anything. 
 I just wanted to meet you so that I could say I've met you and that you've met me. 
 I still don't understand. 
 There was a mistake at the hospital. 
 Daphne's the one that you left. 
 I'm your real daughter. 
 Girls, I'm sorry, But I'm not anyone's father. 
 But you're Angelo Sorrento. 
 I am. I'm also gay. 
 I have known since I was five. 
 I've never slept with a woman. 
 If you were my daughter, it would be the immaculate conception. 
 Ever donate sperm? 
 No. 
 But we look alike. 
 And that's flattering thinking that I could be responsible for someone as beautiful as you or both of you. 
 Am I supposed to be both your dads? 
 It's complicated. 
 I'm terribly sorry. I'm not who you're looking for, but I do hope you find him. 
 Thanks. 
 Have you heard from the girls? 
 Daphne texted. They're grabbing a bite. 
 That's a nice dress. 
 What is it? 
 Are you going to see Bruce? 
 What are you gonna warn me about now, huh? 
 Bruce talks on his cell phone when he drives? 
 Bruce wrecks the plots to good movies? 
 Bruce won't take his shoes off in the house? 
 Bruce is seeing Denise again. 
 No, he isn't. 
 Yes, he is. 
 Kathryn, I like him. 
 I'm not just seeing him to piss you off. 
 I know. That's why this is so hard for me to tell you. 
 No it's not. You've been trying to break us up since before we started seeing each other. 
 That's because I know Bruce. 
 So do I. He's charming and generous, and it's been a long time since I felt like this. 
 Okay, Bruce came over here with an earring that he thought was yours. 
 And then Denise came over later and she saw it... 
 Kathryn, stay out of my business. 
 I can't believe that wasn't him. 
 Shouldn't I have known? 
 First clue should have been that it was a gay bar. 
 Seriously? Everyone in there was gay? 
 Akh, wow, I have no gay-dar. 
 I'm sorry I dragged you both into this. 
 No, I'm happy I came. 
 I needed to say all that, and hopefully one day, I'll get to say it to the right guy. 
 I can't do this again. I think I'm done looking. 
 You can't give up. 
 There can't be that many Angelo Sorrentos in the world. 
 The guitar case you and Emmette found when you were little. 
 How do you know about that? 
 He thinks it was Angelos'. 
 Okay, well, we found this guitar pick in his car, so... 
 You found his car? 
 In a junkyard. 
 When? 
 A few days ago. 
 It wasn't that big a deal. She didn't like us going trough his stuff. 
 Okay, what do you think is in the guitar case? 
 I have no idea. 
 You've never looked at it? 
 No. 
 Well, could we look in your house? 
 I thought you were done. 
 How long can you stay tonight? 
 I go to work in the morning, so about an hour. 
 Yeah? 
 You know I came by to see you today. 
 Yeah, Kathryn told me. 
 Oh, I'm sure she did. 
 She said... 
 I know it's crazy, but she said you were sleeping with your ex-wife. 
 Which one? 
 That's not funny. 
 You're right. I'm sorry. 
 Yes, I am. 
 What? 
 Wait. You are? 
 Regina, I didn't know that we were exclusive yet. 
 We weren't, but... 
 I mean, things were getting serious. 
 I was gonna introduce you to Daphne. 
 Okay, my head is spinning. 
 Do you have feelings for her? 
 Wow. You do. 
 What if I have feelings for both of you? 
 Okay, you can still only sleep with one of us. 
 And you have a history with her. 
 Okay, what if I don't want history? 
 What if I want you? 
 In my experience, history usually wins. 
 Regina, Regina, come on. 
 Regina! 
 Get out of here. It's over. 
 I confessed to stealing the test alone by myself. 
 Just get out. 
 I don't get... 
 Chad and James told Thatcher I'm the one who sold them the tests. 
 I'm suspended for two weeks, but I don't have to take you down with me. 
 You're in the clear. Go home, smoke a peace pipe. 
 Name your first child after me. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Come in. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 So you were right about Denise and the... 
 I was wrong, and Bruce is history. 
 Good. 
 Well, you know, I wasn't meddling. 
 You weren't? 
 All right, fine. You're right, I was, but I'm just the kind of person that when I find out my friend's boyfriend is sleeping with his ex-wife, I tell that friend. 
 So I'm your friend? 
 Well, it's easier than calling you "My biological daughter's other mother" over and over again. 
 Yeah. Well, yeah. 
 Okay, thanks for the heads up. 
 Hey, you know, John's V.P. at the car wash is single. 
 Bye-bye, Kathryn. 
 You getting out? 
 What is your hurry? 
 Anxious for more of dad's stone-cold stares and dangerously repressed anger? 
 Not after I tell him I fixed everything. 
 Hmm... technically Wilke fixed everything. 
 My point is I am not suspended. 
 My debt's clear. Everything is back to normal. 
 Uh-huh. 
 So that's it? Lesson learned, you'll never do it again? 
 Lesson learned, little sister. 
 And you'll never do it again. 
 What, break into school and steal a test? Definitely not. 
 Poker? 
 I'm not gonna bet five grand on one hand again. That was my mistake. 
 Hey, is your mom here? 
 Yeah, why? 
 We need to talk to her. 
 Is it about the guitar case? 
 No, about Toby. Can I come in? 
 Yeah. 
 Bay told you. 
 You need help. 
 No, she needs help. 
 Now that I'm in the clear she can't stand being the problem child again. 
 Right. This is her fault. 
 I don't have a problem. 
 Nobody else thinks so, either. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 What are you doing? 
 Arm wrestling you for it. 
 You win, mum's the word. 
 I win, you're talking to your parents. Let's go. 
 You're crazy. 
 You have an addiction. 
 What, is this like radar? 
 You alcoholics can just spot somebody else with a problem? 
 Yeah. 
 Everything's fine. 
 Nobody knows that I stole the test. It's over. 
 Wrong, you may not have gotten caught, but until you take responsibility for how low you sank, it's not over. 
 Well, I appreciate it, but I really don't think it's any of your concern. 
 Right, 'cause I'm just some lady who lives in your guest house? 
 Hmm. 
 Let me tell you something. 
 When Daphne's father left, I promised myself I would stop drinking. 
 Then after I lost all my clients, I promised myself again. And then again, after I stole money from my mom for vodka. 
 And finally, social services threatened to take Daphne away from me. 
 That's when I figured out I'm not so good at keeping promises to myself. 
 I had to start making them to other people. 
 Toby, you need to tell your parents you have a problem. 
 Hey, Dale. 
 I can't talk to you, John. 
 Come on, man, you were all Chatty Cathy at the golf course last week. 
 Now you're stalking me outside my office asking me for info you know I can't give. 
 Yes, you can, come on. 
 Dale, what big secret does the hospital board have on the Kennish family? 
 Is it about me? Is it about Kathryn? 
 'Cause if it's about Kathryn, you've got to tell me so I can protect my wife. 
 I can't. 
 Dale, for five minutes, be my friend. 
 You know we've been through hell. 
 Fine. 
 It's all gonna come out in discovery anyway. 
 It's not what we have on you or Kathryn. It's the other mom. 
 Regina? She's not even part of the lawsuit. 
 Is it the D.U.I.? 
 It's got nothing to do with it. 
 It's gotta be the D.U.I. 
 It's not. 
 It's something else. 
 Something worse than... What? What? 
 I've said too much already. 
 Please, Dale, just... 
 Dale. 
 So should I make dinner for two or three? 
 Yeah, I think it's just gonna be us. 
 I don't get to meet Bruce? 
 Yeah, I ended it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's better when it's just us anyway. 
 So, mom, how come you don't play the guitar anymore? 
 'Cause I never did. 
 But you have that guitar case. 
 Oh, that. 
 You know, I don't know why I still have that. 
 I'm such a pack rat. I should get rid of it. 
 I'm gonna go get the rest from the car. 
 Hi. 
 Daphne's not here. Her class isn't today. 
 Oh,look, if it is about my dad, I don't want to hear it anymore. 
 Daphne... you. 
 You and Daphne were talking. 
 Okay, you and Daphne were talking about you and me? 
 Okay, no, you guys were not talking about you and me. 
 Hey, dad. 
 Yeah? 
 Can I give you something? 
 Sure. 
 It's my lucky deck. 
 What, are you serious? 
 Okay, maybe my not-so-lucky deck. 
 And why are you giving this to me? 
 Because I lost $10,000, almost got kicked out of school, and still all I can think about is getting back to the table. 
 You understand I can't always be around to stop you. 
 Yeah, I know, but I need to be accountable to somebody. 
 And I'd like to be accountable to you. 
 I can't let Wilke take the whole blame for this. 
 So tomorrow I'm gonna go see Mr. Thatcher and tell him the truth... that I sold the test. 
 Good man. 
 I'm going to Melody's. We're gonna gossip and eat fancy cheese. 
 That always cheers us up.
