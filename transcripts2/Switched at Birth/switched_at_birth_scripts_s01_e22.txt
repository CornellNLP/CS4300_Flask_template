 Previously on "Switched at birth"... 
 They say you're wanted for assault and battery. 
 This has to be a mistake. 
 No, it isn't. 
 You turned Angelo in! 
 You what? 
 I didn't turn anybody in. 
 Your parents didn't turn Angelo in. 
 I did. 
 Immigration has no record of him. 
 They are so disorganized. I mean he could be deported already and they wouldn't know. 
 My ex came back into my life a few months ago and I'm just not ready. 
 I thought we were in this together... as a team. 
 But lately you've been acting like a free agent. 
 Full disclosure: I have always had a thing for redheads. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 I have a bottle of vodka in my room. 
 I was planning on having a few shots and watching pay-per-view. 
 You hooked up with Emmett? 
 I am asking you to just let this one die for everybody's sake. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 How was your history test? 
 Is something going on? 
 Okay. It seems sort of serious. 
 Emmett, whatever it is, we... 
 Wow! Emmett, whoa. 
 Uh... I... 
 Those are earplugs. You're giving me earplugs? 
 Prom? 
 What are these for? 
 Prom... You're inviting me to prom. 
 You suck. 
 To prom? 
 Yes. Yes, I will. 
 Blow off work. 
 We'll take a nap together. 
 I can't. 
 You better not be flirting with this client as much as you flirted with me. 
 She's 72... Attractive, but not my type. 
 Good. 
 Oh, um, I forgot to tell you that Saturday is Daphne's prom. 
 Okay. 
 And, um, my mom's going to be out of town and Daphne is going to be home late. 
 Very late. 
 Aha. 
 Interesting. 
 Yeah, I thought you might found that interesting. 
 I might have misjudged the size of the letters. 
 I still have to add on the "With me." 
 What are the, uh, the... 
 Gingerbread smurf people? 
 That's Wilke and me. 
 Right, right. 
 It's gonna be great. 
 It's just that at Buckner, people ask each other to prom with kind of a twist. 
 Carlton too. 
 It's really lame, isn't it? 
 You're really good at basketball. 
 I know that a deaf prom isn't Wilke's thing, but I really want him to come. 
 Will you help me? You're so much better at this stuff than me. 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Ta-dah. 
 Wow. Where are you going? 
 Hello? The prom. You volunteered us to chaperone. 
 This is the same color dress I wore at our rehearsal dinner. 
 It still suits you. 
 Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for. 
 I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kathryn... 
 Hey, hope I'm not interrupting. Toby let me in. 
 You look amazing. 
 Yeah, we're going to the prom. 
 What's up, Craig? 
 My PI finished running the numbers on the phone you found in Angelo's storage locker. 
 Several of the calls came from inside the hospital. 
 I found the name of a lactation consultant who was on that night but was never deposed. 
 Colleen Vandernoot. Does that ring any bells? 
 Uh, no, I think I'd remember that name. 
 I thought we could go talk to her together and maybe it would jog your memory. 
 Okay. 
 Great, I'm in. 
 I'm concern that if you're going together that, well, she might feel a little intimidated. 
 "Intimidated"... You mean me. 
 I just think... All right, you two go. 
 Just do me a favor: leave your checkbook here and please try to return in the same car you leave in. 
 This is perfect! You're a genius. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Bay's helping me come up with a great new way to ask Wilke to prom. 
 What about my banner-on-his-car idea? 
 I was wondering... Would you be interested in doing my hair for the prom? 
 Oh, yes! 
 Yes! 
 Really? 
 Oh, you have such beautiful hair, and I've been wanting to get my hands on it for a really long time. 
 A really long time. 
 If that's okay with you. 
 I don't want to interfere with your hair plans. 
 Oh please. I have been her hair guinea pig for years now. I'll be happy for a break. 
 Oh, and I have millions of ideas. 
 Let me just go get my magazines. 
 Uh, it's blocked. 
 That's weird. Can you get it? 
 Sure. 
 Hello? 
 No, it's Bay. 
 How are you? 
 Sure, hold on. 
 He wants to talk to you. 
 Who? 
 Angelo. 
 Gina. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 How are the girls? 
 They're fine. 
 Sit down. 
 They're treating me like a criminal. 
 You are a criminal. 
 I went back to Italy to clear everything up. 
 For us. 
 And when I came back, they detained me at the airport. 
 You could have let me know where you were. 
 As far as I knew, you'd vanished... again. 
 I did try to call you. 
 You never left a message. 
 I was trying to keep you out of it... you and the girls. 
 Keep us out of it? We're in it. The minute you come back... 
 I was trying to do the right thing, Gina. 
 So what are you going to do? 
 I hate to ask you for anything, but I'm gonna need an immigration lawyer. 
 I have one in Italy, but I need someone here. 
 Even if I get you a lawyer and you get out, you can't come back. 
 I'm still the girls' father. with me. 
 You can't come back with me. We're done. 
 Gina, I've thought of you constantly. 
 Everything I do is for us to finally get back together. 
 No. You can't keep disappearing and coming back and turning my life upside down. I won't do it anymore. 
 The girls can make their own decisions about you, but my mind is made up. 
 I'll see what I can do about getting you a lawyer. 
 So is Bay going anywhere after prom? 
 I don't know yet. What about Daphne? 
 I haven't asked yet. 
 Well, Toby and a bunch of his friends, they rented a hotel suite after the Buckner prom. It's what they do. 
 Although, I have to admit, it feels a little different with girls. 
 So what did you say to Toby? 
 Well, at the advice of a counselor friend, I told John to go out and buy a box of condoms. 
 And we told him that we were putting them in his bathroom and that we expected him to be responsible If he was having s*x, but we weren't encouraging it. 
 And then I promised not to count the condoms. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 You have the right to remain silent. 
 Anything you sign can be used against you, because I'm taking you to the Carlton prom. 
 It's this Saturday. 
 Uh, Daphne, I... 
 I thought you'd like the handcuffs. 
 Look, I'd love to go, but I can't. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. 
 I have this modern civ paper due on Monday. 
 My dad's on my ass about my grades. 
 He won't let me out of the house. 
 Can't you get an extension? 
 This is the extension of the extension. 
 You know I wanna go. 
 If there was any other way... 
 No, I know. 
 It's okay... really. 
 I guess I should let you go. 
 Hi, prom! 
 Oh god, the only thing that would make her happier is a double wedding. 
 Very funny. 
 Here. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 She's been eyeing it since she was five. 
 I was saving it for a big night. 
 I take back anything snarky that I may have just said. 
 Thank you, mom. 
 You're welcome. 
 I don't know what you're gonna be wearing, but this is like a magic purse... it goes with everything. 
 Oh, thank you so much. It's perfect I am so excited! 
 Take a bunch of pictures of you guys and your dates together! 
 Bye. 
 Great, now I'm disappointing her too. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm not going to the prom. 
 Wilke can't come. He has a paper due. 
 I'm sorry, are we talking about the same Wilke? 
 Tall, blonde, really in love with himself, no interest in school? 
 He said his dad grounded him until the paper was finished. 
 Well, forget Wilke. You don't need him to go. 
 Lots of people go without dates at Buckner. 
 They just hang out with their friends. 
 It has to be the same at Carlton. 
 I guess. 
 And you got me and you got Emmett and you got the magic purse. 
 And I'll be there making horrifying A.S.L. blunders that will provide hilarious memories for years to come. 
 You can't miss that. 
 Okay, I'll go. 
 Mrs. Vandernoot, we are thrilled you agreed to meet with us, but we haven't been able to find any record of you having ever worked at the hospital. 
 Oh, I was an independent contractor. 
 I'm afraid I don't remember you or the other mom. 
 But I've read about your story. 
 I can't even imagine what you've been through. 
 Thank you. 
 Were there any hospital policies that might have contributed to the switch? 
 Nurses' hours, a lack of oversight? 
 Oh, absolutely. Those nurses were run ragged. 
 We were just transitioning to a computer system back then, so they were still writing all the babies' names with pen. 
 Well, you can imagine the different handwriting, smudges, bracelets slipping off... 
 Frankly, I'm surprised it didn't happen more often than it did. 
 I'm really happy to testify to whatever you need. 
 This is fantastic. We're both so grateful for your courage in coming forward. 
 This is a huge break for us. 
 Of course! I'm glad to do it. 
 That hospital's been a lawsuit waiting to happen. 
 'Cause once they got that computer system up and running, they started imprinting the babies with bar codes. 
 Bar codes? 
 Yeah, I'm not sure I understand either. 
 Well, they're laying the groundwork for the coming of the anti-christ. 
 So tonight... are you nervous? 
 Yeah! 
 It's like my signing coming-out party. 
 Or like the A.S.L. final. 
 Do you remember your first all-deaf party? 
 Oh god, yeah. Melody took me way too soon. 
 Your signing is much better than mine was. 
 Regina? 
 Mm-hmm? 
 This is going to be so beautiful. 
 Did Angelo ask about me? 
 Of course. 
 He wanted to make sure that you were all right. 
 Do you think he's gonna be able to stay? 
 I... 
 I don't know. 
 But he knows that we want him here, right? 
 Bay, even if he gets to stay, it's not going to be the way it was before. 
 I told him that none of us wants to keep going on the Angelo roller coaster. 
 So he doesn't know that we want him. 
 He knows what to realistically expect. 
 Yes? 
 Hi, I'm Daphne. I brought Wilke some lemon bars. 
 Oh, how nice. 
 And how nice to finally meet you. 
 Come in, come in. 
 Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back. 
 Yeah, that works. 
 I was starting to believe that you didn't actually exist. 
 Oh no, I'm totally real. 
 James has told us so much about you. 
 You'r... you're just so different from anybody that he's ever dated. 
 Is that a good thing? 
 Well, for him, absolutely. 
 But given what he's told us about you, I'm not so sure what you see in him. 
 Wilke's great... funny, smart. 
 Is he here? 
 No, he snuck off again without telling me where he was going. 
 I assume it's one final act of rebellion before he leaves. 
 Leaves? Is he going somewhere? 
 Boarding school. 
 Did you just say "Boarding school"? 
 He didn't tell you, did he? 
 No. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It was nice to meet you. 
 Yeah. 
 No. Victory! Victory and Gardner. 
 Yes it's a flat tire can... look, we have been waiting here an hour already. 
 As soon as you can... thank you. 
 No, the bike looks amazing. 
 Ohhh. Here. 
 This is a night to remember. 
 You put my name on it. 
 That is way cooler than a corsage. 
 Have fun. 
 Tell Daphne that we'll meet her there. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 It's Angelo. 
 I'm sorry. I hate that I'm thinking about this tonight, but it sounds like Regina made him feel like no one wants him here and I don't want him to leave before I get the chance to see him again. 
 We can't go now. 
 Because... it's your prom. 
 Finished my paper early. 
 You still up for a little prom action? 
 What the hell? 
 I turn my phone off for a few hours and you go find yourself another date? 
 It's not a date and you didn't tell me you were coming. 
 I wanted to surprise you! 
 Yeah, I guess you're full of surprises. 
 
 
 
 What did he say? 
 He wants to know how your paper's going. 
 It's great, man. I'll let you read it. 
 Can we get out of here? 
 I kinda have this whole night planned for us. 
 Yes, just give me a minute. 
 Okay. Thanks for the gesture, but I got this. 
 We're gonna give him a ride to prom. 
 Are you kidding? 
 Hey. 
 No touching. 
 Look how gorgeous you are. 
 Thank you. I'm going to my boyfriend's prom actually. 
 He's waiting outside right now. 
 I can't wait to meet him. 
 Sit down, please. Sit down. 
 So what happened? I mean you just disappeared. 
 I just wanted to clear everything up and just be done with it. 
 Why didn't you call? I was really worried. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I just knew your parents were badmouthing me. 
 And I figured I would wait until I see you on my own. 
 They weren't badmouthing you. 
 I'm sure they were not so upset that I was gone. 
 If Adrianna hadn't called immigration, I'm sure your parents would have done it. 
 No, they were actually going to try to help you. 
 Well, what happens next? 
 Um, I'm going to try everything I can do to stay here... I mean not here. 
 Can I do anything? Do you need anything? 
 No no. 
 There is something. 
 I'm trying to call my lawyer in Italy but... 
 But? 
 But I have to pay for those calls personally, and I've run through everything. 
 I have like $40. 
 Do you mind? 
 Does he mind? 
 Hey hey, buddy? 
 Did you rent that shirt or do you own it? 
 Wilke! 
 Sorry. 
 But he's ruining this. 
 Well, maybe you should've answered my texts. 
 I told you. My phone was off. 
 I was writing my paper. And then I was out planning the perfect prom night, which at least someone is enjoying. 
 Are you kidding? After that there is nothing I want more than to be here. 
 Come on, car wash guy's gone. 
 It's just you and me, and music so loud it'll make your ears bleed. 
 Did your dad tell you I stopped by today? 
 No, I haven't seen him since this morning. 
 Why, did he say something? 
 Yeah, he did. 
 He said you were going to boarding school. 
 Yeah, I was gonna get to that. 
 Really? When? 
 When were you gonna get to that? 
 After prom. 
 Look, my grades suck. 
 I thought maybe if I aced this paper, I could convince him to give me one more chance to stay at Buckner. 
 But then I realized with only two days left, there was no way I could finish the paper, let alone ace it. 
 So I just chucked it in and came out with you. 
 And you never said a word. 
 I was hoping I'd figure it out. 
 I don't even know why you bothered to tell me at all. 
 You should have just disappeared. 
 Daphne. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hi. I don't know the sign for alcohol, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to be drinking it. 
 Oh, you drinky no. 
 Uh-huh, let's have it. 
 I'll take that and the flask. 
 Very good. 
 Is the chicken marsala that bad? 
 Or should I be taking this as a hint? 
 What? 
 Oh. Um, I'm sorry. 
 It's just Angelo, my ex, well, whatever... 
 I know who he is. 
 Okay, just John said that he would try to find him an immigration lawyer, and I know that Bay and Daphne are waiting... 
 You know what? Never mind. 
 You can tell me about it. 
 No. 
 I mean, I appreciate that, but I shouldn't be... 
 Here I am on a date with a great guy, a wonderful, interesting guy, who hasn't once mentioned needing a lawyer or being deported. 
 So that's all I have to do to get good credit is not mention being deported? 
 Crap. 
 There goes my dessert conversation. 
 Okay. 
 I am here with you, end of story. 
 Sure. No problem. 
 I'm totally fine. 
 I'm just gonna stand here and try to look deaf. 
 Were you requesting "Taking care of business"? 
 What? 
 Were you requesting "Taking care of business"? 
 Honey, that is not a bad song. 
 I said 'cause I like to party party. 
 Okay, I'm sorry. 
 I'm terrible. 
 No, actually, you're pretty great. 
 C'mere. 
 Oh no, that's far too much. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I can't believe I'm missing my daughter's prom. 
 I really thought this whole thing would take two hours max. I am so sorry. 
 I promise these guys are like a minute away. 
 I just hope our tow-truck driver doesn't have the mark of the devil. 
 Bizarre, right? 
 I know! 
 She's definitely not going to make a credible witness, but I'll tell you what. 
 There was some pretty useful stuff in all that crazy. 
 Really? I hope so. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you're cold. Let me give you my jacket. 
 Oh no no no. 
 Naw, come on. 
 I'll just go sit in the car. 
 Wear it, really. 
 Honestly, I don't want to. 
 Really nice and warm. 
 I'm not gonna let you freeze. 
 Honestly, I... 
 Oh. 
 Um... 
 I am so sorry. 
 No. I... I... I just think I better call my son and have him pick me up. 
 It wasn't just you. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You guys are so late. Is everything okay? 
 Yeah, we... 
 I went to go see Angelo. 
 Tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you want to hear about it? 
 Not really. 
 Good, because I don't want to talk about it. 
 I think we both deserve one night free of drama, if that's humanly possible. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, my night is already ruined. 
 Wilke is going to boarding school. 
 Really? 
 Damn. I know his dad has been threatening that for years, but I had no idea that he was serious. 
 Yeah. Well, he is. 
 Aww, man. Good ol' Wilke. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, why don't we get out of here and give him a proper send-off? 
 We could hit the golf course or worlds of fun. 
 I'll call Toby and Simone and we'll have a night to remember. 
 Oh... sheesh. 
 Is there alcohol in the flask? 
 No, there's no alcohol. 
 It's more like lighter fluid. 
 Show-off. 
 Kathryn is, um... out playing Nancy Drew with our attorney. Yeah, mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 "Been through a lot" yes. 
 Yeah. 
 Long something. 
 But I don't know what the rest of it... 
 She said she envies your devotion. 
 You're long-distance runners. 
 Yes, we are. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Come on. You said nobody's home. 
 I know. But I don't usually come in when they're not here. It's kind of a thing. 
 A thing? 
 Wait! No lights. 
 This is their home. 
 But you have the key. 
 I know, but not for sneaking in the middle of the night to steal condoms. 
 Thanks for the lift, Toby. Hi honey! 
 Mom, no! 
 What? 
 No, don't... 
 I just wanted to say hi. 
 No. Daphne either. 
 Just go dance with dad. I'm going to go get you some punch. 
 Don't say hi to either of them. 
 Hi. 
 Do you want to dance? 
 I would love to dance. 
 I'm sorry I've been so hard on you lately. 
 I haven't exactly been prince charming. 
 I just want us back. 
 Me too. 
 You were right. 
 Let's just put it all aside and have one last great night together. 
 Or at least I'm going to try. 
 I'm in. 
 Bay was just saying maybe we should all go out... her, Emmett, maybe Toby and Simone. 
 Yeah, I don't know about inviting those guys. 
 Especially Emmett. 
 What is the deal with you and Emmett? 
 Since the day I met you, you've given me crap about him. 
 Honestly? I think the guy's a phony. 
 A phony? Emmett is the most real person I know. 
 I don't think you know him as well as you think you do. 
 What'd you say? 
 Forget it. 
 No, say it. 
 Emmett slept with Simone at the basketball tournament. 
 Why would you say that? 
 Because it's true. Simone told me. 
 Simone's a liar. 
 Well yeah, maybe she lied. 
 When did she tell you this? 
 At the movie shoot. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because I don't want to get involved. 
 This concerns my brother, my best friend and Bay. 
 You didn't think I should know? 
 Well, I'm telling you now! 
 Where are you going? 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm sorry to interrupt... 
 He lied to me. 
 He looked me in the eye and he lied to me. 
 What am I supposed to do with this information? 
 I wasn't sure so I went with "Nothing." 
 Simone said it was all a big mistake. 
 It's not going to happen again, for what that's worth. 
 Look, I'll do whatever you want. 
 If you want to tell Bay, we'll tell her. 
 It's their night too. I'm not sure I can ruin it for them. 
 You can decide this tomorrow. 
 Let's all have one last night, just you and me, without any of this getting in the way. 
 Hey... hey! 
 All right, slow down. 
 Okay. Wait wait... hold on. 
 Oh, that is so much better. 
 My ears can breathe! 
 What's going on? 
 Mistake. 
 What happened? 
 Whatever it is, we can fix it. 
 Is this a joke... like the ring box with the earplugs? 
 Because it's not funny. 
 Daphne? You and Daphne? 
 You slept with Daphne? 
 But someone. You slept with someone. 
 Emmett! 
 But you don't even know her. 
 Don't follow me. 
 You know, I never fought so hard for anyone in my life. 
 I finally get her and I'm sent away. 
 Come on. You're going to forget all about me. 
 Two weeks at that fancy boarding school and it'll be like, "Daphne who?" 
 You are the one who is going to forget about me. 
 Yeah, probably. 
 You are! 
 You're going to go on to... 
 I don't know, run some four-star restaurant and marry some perfect guy and have like six perfect kids. 
 And I'll be disowned by my family and forced to trade on my looks to become a kept man. 
 Do you really think that about yourself? 
 That that's all you are? 
 Hey, I'm serious. Listen to me. 
 Don't shortchange yourself. 
 Come here. 
 Hey, man. The sound is amazing. 
 So where's Bay? 
 You okay? Something happen? 
 Oh, you're home early. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Oh yeah, sure. 
 The lawyer that Craig recommended called me and he's willing to take Angelo's case. 
 I can't get pulled into this. 
 Of course I want to help Angelo stay for the girls' sake, but... 
 Regina, any way we come at this, we're gonna be involved. 
 Okay, come on in. 
 Thank you. 
 So what are his options? 
 The lawyer can fight deportation on the grounds that Angelo has been in the country for 10 years. 
 Okay. 
 But that probably is not gonna work because Angelo has a criminal record. 
 Now he can fight deportation on the grounds that it would cause undue hardship to his child... who is a U.S. citizen. 
 I don't want to do anything where Bay has to testify. 
 I agree 100% and it probably wouldn't work. 
 So there isn't much that can be done. 
 Well, he might be able to stay if... 
 If? 
 I'm trying to remember the exact words the lawyer used. 
 If Angelo... 
 Mm-hmm? 
 In good faith, marries a U.S. citizen.
