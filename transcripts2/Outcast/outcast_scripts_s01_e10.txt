 Okay?

 Johnny? 
 What in the holy hell is goin' on here? 
 (Barking continues) 
 Buzz, stop! 
 There's been an accident. 
 What kind of accident? 
 It's, um-- 
 We need your help. 
 Honey, what is it? 
 Evening, Rose. Sorry to trouble you so late. 
 I got it, Rosie. 
 Got what? 
 Apparently, we got a situation. 
 Well, then I guess you better deal with it, but don't leave these children standing out in the cold. 
 Giles : Come on in, sweetheart. 
 There you go, honey. 
 Come on. It's okay. 
 There we go. 
 Let's get them inside. 
 Come on in, darling. 
 It's okay. 
 Come on in. That's it. 
 It's okay. 
 There you go. 
 Giles : Buzz, stop. 
 We didn't know where else to go. 
 I've known that family for... 
 How could his wife-- 
 Kyle : Chief. 
 It wasn't her. 
 Who's gonna believe that? 
 A man is dead. 
 One of mine. 
 And you show up at my house with his blood on your hands? 
 What the f*ck do you expect me to do? 
 We gotta find her. 
 She can't ever know what happened. 
 And how are you gonna do that? 
 She won't remember. 
 We say it was an accident. 
 You asking me to cover up a homicide? 
 She didn't kill anyone. 
 Law ain't gonna see it that way. 
 The law will see it however you want to see it. 
 (Bubbling) 
 (Dramatic music playing) 
 This is the second time you've broken into my house. 
 Second time you know about. 
 And this house belongs to some old dude who offed himself a month ago. 
 I checked. 
 Sliced himself up pretty good. 
 If you're finished, you should go home. 
 You know, Anderson doesn't seem to be gettin' your message. 
 And what message is that? 
 Well, that the clock's ticking. 
 He better pack up his sh1t and get the f*ck out of town before whatever you're here for gets real. 
 What do you think I'm here for? 
 Must be big. 
 Considering what I'm guessing you did to get this house. 
 And what you did to Anderson. 
 And if it f*cks this town right in the ass, then you can count me in. 
 Kat : Shh, shh, shh. 
 It's okay. 
 Shh. It's all right. I'm here. 
 (Whimpering) 
 Oh, oh, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Yeah, get that out of there. 
 It's okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Shh. 
 Kat : Shh, shh, shh, shh. 
 I got you. I got you. 
 Shh. It's okay. 
 I know, it hurts, it hurts. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 Would you dump that out for me, sweetheart? 
 Get me some fresh? 
 Why would it-- 
 Why would it do that to itself? 
 She didn't like the light. 
 You know they're like that. 
 But Christ, her eyes. 
 This is why what we're doing here is so important. 
 We need to get to them sooner. 
 Babe, the water? 
 Shh. I'm here. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 It's okay. 
 Here you go. 
 Oh, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Take good care of you. 
 Yeah, that feels good, huh? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Honey, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 (Clattering) 
 Is somebody out there? 
 Better not be f*cking with my car. 
 I-- I'm serious. 
 We have security cameras out here. 
 sh1t. 
 Hey, uh-- 
 You have to get out of here or I have to call the police. 
 What-- Seriously. 
 What-- what are you doing? 
 (Sniffing) 
 (Screams) 
 Woman (on radio) :  Any unit, Code 1. 
 (Radio static crackles) 
 No injuries reported. 
 (Police radio chatter) 
 You catch that? 
 Something about a hit and run I think. 
 I don't know how Giles can understand that thing. 
 You know this is a long shot. 
 I mean, maybe we should just call the state police. 
 No. They'll only lock her up. 
 I won't be able to get close enough to pull that thing out of her. 
 Are you not afraid of how she might end up? 
 After. 
 I been thinkin' about that. 
 Why it is we can help some but not others. 
 Who knows? The strength of the demon, their will to resist it. 
 It's got something to do with how long it's been inside of her. 
 Think about Joshua, Allison. 
 It had only been days. 
 And then there's Blake, where it had been years. 
 At that point, they're too far gone. 
 Well, what about your mother and Sherry? 
 There's gotta be some time in between where I can still get it out of them, but it tears something of the person out with it. 
 Just keep looking. 
 There's still time. 
 Woman (on radio) :  Any unit in the vicinity of 5219 Springdale Avenue. 5150. White female. Approximately 30 years old. Possibly under the influence. 1067. Code 3. 
 Let's go. 
 Giles : Hey, it's me. 
 I'm over at Mark Holter's house. 
 There's been an accident. 
 It's too late for that. 
 I need you to come over here and help me clean up. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Policemen grunt) 
 (Shrieking) 
 Hold still! 
 Hey! Don't hurt her! 
 Stop. 
 Wait! 
 Just wait. 
 Stay back! 
 Listen. 
 Don't take another f*cking step. 
 Okay, just listen-- 
 Just-- Kyle, back off. 
 This is his sister. He just wants to help. 
 You want to help? 
 Get this on f*ckin' video! 
 Why don't you tell us what she's on and where she got it? 
 (Woman shrieks) 
 sh1t. 
 It's our mistake. 
 sh1t. 
 Well, where to now? 
 How would I know? 
 You've been doing this a lot longer than I have. 
 I thought we'd determined I'd been doing sh1t. 
 Look, you've been around these things for years. 
 You've seen them, up close. 
 You know how they act. You know what they want. 
 They're all different. 
 Yeah, but they're from the same place. 
 They want the same things. 
 They-- they don't like light, they don't like to be touched, they can't communicate, at least at first. 
 There's gotta be something that drives them. 
 Rev, I need your help. 
 They're all afraid.

 (TV continuing) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (Breathing shakily) 
 Hello. 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Welcome. 
 What is it then? What are they most afraid of? 
 What demons fear the most. The truth, the Word of God-- 
 None of that, Rev. Come on. 
 Specifically, what are they running from? 
 Kyle, you've seen it! 
 Holy water, the Scriptures, the cross. 
 No, the cross just freaks 'em out once you start jabbing at 'em with it. 
 Look. 
 If we can figure out what that thing inside of my sister is running from, maybe we can figure out where it's running to. 
 You know, as violent as they can become... underneath, they're like children. 
 You give them something familiar to... to calm them down like an old photograph, music, toys. 
 Wait a minute. Faces, voices. 
 People, not things. You know, when-- when they're really fighting it, they're crying out for, uh... for a parent. 
 You know, somebody who took care of them. 
 Like they wanna be rescued. 
 Get in the car. 
 
 
 
 (Line ringing) 
 Woman :  Hello? 
 Hi, it's me. 
 Rosie, it's so good to hear your voice. 
 Where are you? 
 On the road. 
 I'm sorry that we had to go without saying goodbye. 
 It was a family emergency. 
 Yeah, don't lie to me, Kat. 
 We all know what's going on in this town. 
 Byron won't talk about it. 
 Nobody will except Reverend Anderson, and no one is listening to him. 
 Kat, if you know something, please tell me. Rosie, what's going on? Did something happen? I don't know. Byron ran off with the Reverend and Kyle Barnes and left me to babysit Barnes' little girl and her cousin. The girls are terrified and so am I. Kat, please. I don't know anything about it, but I'm sure it'll be okay. Um, I have to run, but I-- I'll call you back. Kat, wait. Don't go. Hold on! Bye. (Knock on door) What is it? Does the police chief live here? Who are you? Aaron McCready. He knows me. Well, if you're in trouble, Aaron, you call 911. No, I can't. Is he here? Look, something's going on. What are you talking about? His friend, the Reverend. All that stuff he's been saying about the devil coming to town, it's no joke. Okay, you get on home now. No. Please! I will tell him you were here. Please. Don't make me go back out there. All right, son. You wait right here and I'll give him a call. Ain't gonna worry about it. Megan! Anderson : Easy. Rev. Why come here if it's so full of bad memories? My bad memories. Not hers. You said they want to feel safe. She wasn't coming to this house. She was coming here to find me. We gotta look outside. (Phone ringing) It's Giles. I'm here, Chief. There was a break-in at my house. It was that McCready kid. Now, I find that little sh1t, I'm gonna f*ckin' kill him. What'd he take? Not what. Who. He took Barnes' daughter. He said he was delivering a message. Anderson : From who? I think you know. What is it? He has Amber. (Door opens) Kyle, wait. This is about more than us. He is a false prophet. If we don't stop him, the devil will reign for a thousand years. You really believe that? That that man is the devil and that you have to stop him, no matter what? Yes, I do. Then don't you see, you can't come with me? You-- you and I, we may not agree on what this evil is, where the power to defeat it comes from God or from some place I don't understand. But there is one thing that I see clearly now, and I believe with all of my heart. That if this battle is to be won, it can't be won alone. You're probably right, Rev. But for me, this isn't about the devil. This is about my daughter. And that's it. ♪ ♪ Where's my daughter? I love old American cars. They used to call this a three-body trunk. You said you were bringing her back. Get in. Where is she? We can go round and round on this all night. You can keep asking me questions, you can threaten me, you can hurt me, you can kill me. The only way you're gonna see your little girl again is if you stop talking and get in. Now, put this over your head. What is it about me that makes this all worthwhile? Put that over your head. You'll get your answers. Amber :  Daddy! Kyle :  Hey, little firefly. You're special. Joshua :  So long have we tried to find you, Outcast. Allison :  Protect me from what? Sherry :  Hit me like you hit your pretty wife. (Truck air horn blares) Amber :  I don't want her to stay. I saw it. It was black. And it was cold. (Clacking) (Door opens) Amber : Daddy? Amber! Are you okay? Are you all right? Do we have to stay here? That's right, sweetheart. Sidney : I promised you answers! (Sighs) My kind... we find our way into your world every day. We can't stay where we're from. So, we come here. Where are you from? The same place you are. What? That's why we've been around you your whole life. Now, you're gonna stay right where you are, where I can keep an eye on you... till we need you. Need me for what? (Clacking) Hey! (Shouting) Need me for what? Need me for what? Daddy? Hey, baby. Don't worry, okay? We're going home. Kat : Shh, shh, shh, it's okay. It's okay, I'm right here. I got you. Just tuck you in there just nice and easy. It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart.
