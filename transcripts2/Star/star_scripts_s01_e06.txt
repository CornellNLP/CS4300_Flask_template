 Okay, so last time y'all saw  Star... 
 You're not happy to see me? 
 I didn't kill Otis. 
 Star :  Well, if Simone didn't kill him, then who did? 
 Photographer : Can you switch for me? Yeah. 
 Why does everything have to be a fight with her? 
 'Cause that's all she's ever known. 
 Alexandra :  Well, if we're ever gonna make it as a group, she needs to get it together. 
 My dad is in jail. 
 Must be why you're so tight with your mom. 
 You sure you want to give me your credit card? 
 I see $20,000 spent in a high-end fashion boutique. 
 This is Detective Belkin from the Atlanta Police Department. 
 When's the last time you saw your husband? Leonard :  Jahil's up to something. It's only a matter of time. Carlotta :  Lord, I know you got this... that you oversee all of this, but please keep an extra lookout for this girl. She's naive and ain't got a clue about this thing called fame. Maybe if you pull your eyes away from yourself, we can get to work. I know the work and the song. The children's hospital event is tomorrow. We need to be working. This is work. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we were singers. It says right here, "Word on the street is that Morgan's new love interest, Ms. Star Davis..." that's my name... "is the leader of a new up-and-coming girl group out of Atlanta." There is no leader. (sighs) It's publicity, Alex. That's all. Alexandra : Not the right kind. Do you want to be known as some football player's piece of ass? Our likes are sky-high, and we're trending off the charts. No. You. You're trending. Not our music. Jahil is late again. Do you think it has something to do with this whole Otis thing? I think Jahil has a hangover. I think that's what's wrong with Jahil. (groans) Down. (cocks gun) (phone buzzes) Yeah. You lucky son of a bitch. Wait ten minutes. Then go. (door creaks) (door closes) (heavy breathing) (car door opens and closes) (engine starts) (tires screeching) ♪ ♪ (sighs) I paid off your debt to Maggie and the traffickers. You've been keeping your word to Ed. You've been good to Hunter. I owe you. Yeah, you do, big time. The minute I made that phone call and stopped that bullet from blasting your brains out, that is when I became majority shareholder of your little musical enterprise. From now on, the split is 80-20, 80-20 in my favor. There is no way I'm giving up my group. Nonnegotiable. Star. I want her out. Look, she is a loose cannon, I know that, but she is... Trash. No, she's the face of the group. Mm-mm, not the group that I own. Listen, Arlene, there is no group without Star. You can't have a group without Star at the head of the group. You know, the only thing that I should be hearing from your mouth right now is, "Thank you. Thank you, Arlene." Yeah. All right, well, look, they-they... they got a performance tomorrow night. Good. Make it be her last. No, no, no, make her want it to be her last. Keep that bitch away from my son. ♪ I bring me ♪

What? Can you do it? I mean, yeah, I wrote it, so... All right, let's do it again, then. Alex up front. This is a joke, right? You're joking? Jahil : You know what the joke is? You and your antics putting our Atlanta NextFest slot in jeopardy. That's what the joke is. You're serious? You don't think they monitor all that TMZ garbage? Trust me, they do, and this one right here with her sleazy behavior... you think that's what they want to promote? It ain't. The image, the perception they're trying to put out there is that their contestants are decent, caring human beings, all right? That's why we're doing this charity event. They're not looking for some fame-hungry monster who's banging the local quarterback. And that's why you're doing this, 'cause of Hunter. Did you hear what I said?! But I'm right, though.

It has nothing to do with the money. I was shocked, okay? And, yeah, a little hurt. I'm into you, Star. Right... which is why you let your mother talk to me like that without even letting me explain myself? Okay, with my ma it's a little complicated, all right? Oh. What was that? What-What are you doing? Sorry, I thought I just heard your big balls roll onto the floor. I was looking for them. It's the finances, okay? I ain't good with that kind of stuff and I come from nothing, just like you, Star. And my ma, she handles all the money. And yeah, you're right. I should have heard you out. We got two very different versions of nothing. Okay? I had to scratch and claw for everything I ever got. So, when somebody hands me a credit card, that street bitch just comes out. I wasn't thinking about you. I wasn't thinking about... anything. I want you to be my street bitch. (laughs) Don't ever say that again. Please don't ever say that again, okay? See you at rehearsal. Yo. Go easy on Star. Soon as she goes easy on us. Why'd you take away that lead from Star? You're better for it. Not last week. Then it was all about having the white girl front and center. Not true. Oh, please. What the hell is going on, Jahil? Look, you want to live in Star's shadow, or do you want the world to really know who Alexandra Crane is? Huh? It is all about you, baby. I've been watching you, and I was wrong. It's you. Forget about them low-rent bitches. She's a really good person deep down. But her ego is... (chuckles) Yeah. When I was her age, ego was my religion. We got that in common for sure. You know, maybe we could, I don't know, try and get her to come to church. Sorry, Pastor, but Star is not the church-going type. (both chuckle) I wasn't, either. But I don't know, we might be able to work our magic from both sides, and bully her into coming in or something. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah? Let's do it. Yeah, Uncle Cross will love that. Just bring me some. All right. I'll see you then. All right. Who was that? My cousin Mecca. My Uncle Cross' birthday's tomorrow. We're doing, like, a barbecue thing for him with the family... that I can't wait to show you off to. Don't make me nervous. I'm not everyone's style. They're gonna love you, babe, you know that. (music playing over headphones) What is this? What's going on here? Alexandra : This song, for the Music Loves event. Jahil wants me to sing lead on it. Blondie's mad. Good. Tell here to scratch her ass and get glad. She need to be knocked down a notch. Yeah, she does. But I don't know. Something's not right. I mean, what's right is putting your beautiful face up front. That's what's up. (chuckles) Can I hear it? Yeah. (music playing, Alexandra hums along) Rashid just got shot. What? Damn, who told you that? That was his mama Regina on the phone. The boy was just picking up some groceries for her. Was it the police? I don't even know. She was a wreck. I couldn't even understand nothing she was saying. But who else could it be? Who else... who else could it be? He... he was in a gang, too. Don't go there yet, Cotton. All police ain't bad. I done had quite a few. Some of the best sessions I done ever had. Bitch, you gonna burn in hell. Girl, that's what they say. Pastor here. I'm gonna send him right to Regina's. Cotton, why don't you run up to my bedroom and get that old curling iron? Cotton : Really? Say it. Just say it. You don't want me here when your holy crush walks in. Just get the damn iron. I think it'd be good for you. But I'm clean now. They'll help you stay that way. Hey. I was just telling Simone about my friend's recovery group, you know? That'd be real good. I invited Pastor over for Sunday dinner. That's if it's okay with you. Um, so I'll just see you on Sunday. Hey, Bobby, would you mind just going and checking on Sister Regina? Her son got shot. My God. Okay, I will. See you, babe. All right, I'll text you her address. Yeah. (car door closes) (engine starts) ♪ From where you go... ♪ Look, I'm not a miracle worker. I need more time. ♪ You are mine and I am yours ♪ Yeah, I hear you loud and clear. ♪ Forever ♪ Great, and take a five. (music stops) You hear that? Yeah. Alex sounds good. Yeah, she is good, just not as good as me. I know you're unhappy, really, and I'm sorry. No, I don't care if you're sorry, just put it back the way that it's supposed to be. No, it's the right thing to do for now, trust me. Why you gotta make this so damn difficult? Because you won't tell me the real reason you just made that switch. You want your place back up front, stay the hell away from Hunter. Why? 'Cause he told me that you snort more coke than Tony Montana? Or because you're just plain jealous? You know, Star, whether you want to believe this or not, all I care about is what's right for you. Now, I love Hunter like a nephew, but he is bad news... Trust me on this. Don't get caught up with him. You're pissed off because Hunter's everything you're not, and he has me. You ungrateful little bitch. Give up the blow, and maybe I'll give up Hunter. (gospel music playing) Baked chicken  and  sweet potato pie? Since when you became Paula Deen? My pastor is coming by for dinner after church. You sure you want me to be here? Stop that. Come on, Mama. Now, we both know what's up. Really? What is up, Cotton? You chose to be who you are. Don't put your issues on me. And I ain't having dinner without you. So I'm supposed to say thank you now? ♪ I... believe ♪ 
♪  I believe in the Lord...  ♪ Don't even worry about it, Mama. 'Cause your precious pastor ain't gonna know. Not unless you tell him. And why would you do that? ♪ Angels came from heaven down... ♪ 
♪ ♪ I don't know. (sighs) Then don't ask for my help, then. You look cute. Girl, you look normal. Okay, for God's sakes, this is a barbecue. Just don't use your big-ass words, and slouch a little bit... Slouch, slouch. That's already better. Yeah, there you go, yeah. I don't slouch. Look what I got for the charity event. You think it's cute? Is that what you're wearing? I'm going to Derek's uncle's barbecue first. How come I'm not invited? Like you'd want to go. Hunter said he wanted me to be his "street bitch." (laughter) Wow, he's a kinky one, isn't he? And Star isn't? I don't know, you guys. You think his family will respond to me? Respond to you? Yeah. No. Not if you talk like that. Just go in there and act regular. Don't stare at any of his cousins who have missing teeth, and don't squint or act surprised by his aunties with bad weaves. You gotta respect the fact she didn't grow up the way that we did. What I respect is us having our priorities straight. Like you getting the lead spot back? Oh, no, that's your spot today, Alex. Everybody who's anybody in Atlanta's gonna be there. Kill it. Don't fall on your face 'cause you're letting me rent space in your head. Star, why you gotta go say stuff like that? Grow up, Simone. No, you grow up! Stop hurting people. Alex didn't ask for that lead part. Then she should have said no.

Which I understand. But Alex, you did great, too. And people will see that. What matters is that we're in, right? All right, she don't get it. It's exactly why I got to leave this outfit. You hurt her, Star. And she will get over that. But what matters right now is that thousands of people are looking at us, Simone, us. You keep it up and there won't be an us. I mean, look at you...
