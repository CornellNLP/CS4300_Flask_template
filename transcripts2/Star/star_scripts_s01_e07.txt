 So last you was all watching this, it was, like... 
 (singing in Spanish) 
 (singing continues) 
 He'll love the hell out of that. 
 Carlotta : That's my baby boy. 
 Cotton is a man. 
 Kick her out of the group, and get that bitch away from my son. 
 Star : What about Otis? 
 Carlotta : It's being handled. 
 My dad's in jail. 
 Must be why you're so tight with your mom. 
 Carlotta : I ain't got no time for your activating, boy. 
 You see they killin' us out here. 
 Reporter : Danielle Jackson was shot and killed by police. 
 No, no, no. 
 They took her. 
 (piano playing softly) 
 Carlotta :  Seems like bad things always happenin' to good people. 
 Romans 8:28 says: "And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose." 
 Lord, I'm tryin' to figure it out, but I can't see the purpose in this. She was so bossy. Ooh. From the minute she was born, she started running things. She was a... she was a doer, she was a go-getter. And she worked her way through school. What a child. (sniffles) She'll stand the test. What happened to Danielle, it was wrong. It was wrong! And it's this world that we live in! And the way we live in it. It's the reason why she's not here. Harris : Sister Gladys, we are all gonna lift you up in prayer. There's so many moments where the energy and the sadness has overtaken this congregation. Once again, trying to find the words to encourage you. This is a sister, a daughter, a granddaughter, a niece, a friend, a cousin, that's gone too soon. I'd like to invite my sister in Christ, Sister Kelly Price. (piano playing) ♪ I don't know ♪

Why did you? I needed a place to stay. Oh, just stop, all right? Stop! I'm... Stop lying! I'm not. I had no money, no job, nowhere to go. "Ayude me por favor. No tengo dónde ir." Probably some rich kid, got disowned by your family. Eva : No, I'm not. I just happen to have a good ear. I learned from American songs and TV. And you can sing. Yeah, I heard you in the shower. You knew I was there. You wanted me to hear you. No, I actually didn't. But I'm glad you finally did hear me. You know what? You a hustler. I know one when I see one. Just like you. Just like me? Mm-hmm. (chuckles) So, what? You want me to believe it was just by chance you came knocking at my door? I don't believe in chance. ♪ 'Cause you want me and I want you ♪ I've always dreamed of being a singer. Especially here in the States. Oh, is that right? Yeah. ♪ Tell me is that deja vu ♪

And that's taking it to the streets. Going to the police and protestin'. Oh, so you want to give the police a reason to do even more damage. Since when do we need to give 'em a reason? You turn on the news right now, all you see is black people being killed. Miss Bruce : Then they want to say "unfortunate mistake at a routine traffic stop." I'm with Derek. You know how this story goes, Pastor. A cop gets a smack on the wrist and it's over. If we stay quiet, they'll think it's okay with us. And it's not okay. Of course it's not. Derek : Right. We need to be going down to the police station and demand an indictment. You know what Dr. King said: "A riot is the language of the unheard." We're not rioting. Period. And we ain't gonna just pray, either. This ain't what you want. (paint can spraying) Yo, yo! I know. Meeting at 7:30. How 'bout you sing at the rally? Sing? No, I'm not doing that. Why not? Because... it's about Danielle, not us. Your group should sing. Protest songs are a tradition. Odetta sang at the March on Washington. We're not Odetta. Especially not Star. I don't trust her to take it seriously, all right? You're wrong. Star is... out of her mind, but she's down. But I'm not talking about Star. I'm talking about you. Come on, baby, just sing. Keep it 100. You want to move the people? Come on. Alexandra : All right, what are we trying to say here? That it's the same old story, day after day, and it's only getting worse. That works. What's up? Derek wants us to sing for the protest. I like that. Alexandra : I told him I wasn't sure. I didn't want it to become just another social media op for us. You mean me. Why don't you just say it? You like the spotlight more than the music. Look, we're taking a stand for Danielle and her family. But I can't imagine you know what everyday people go through. Everyday people like who, you? No, I can't. Bitch, I'm everyday people. I wasn't born with a silver spoon up my ass. Alexandra : It doesn't matter where I'm from. College Park or Park Avenue, I'm black wherever I go. Okay. And so am I. Oh, wow. So, I'm just too white for both of you. That's what this is. Okay. And that's how you feel, too? Bein' half-black? People don't see me that way. Don't ever confuse my determination for our fame with me being able to understand and feel everybody right now. God, how could you box me in with them? Both of you should know better than that. You want to do this thing by yourselves, cool. I'll go to Hunter's.I  can't believe this. Should we go after her? You can. I've got a song to write. (consistent knocking on door) Who is it? What a dump. It's nice to see you, too, sweetheart. Are we alone? Yeah, my niece is at work. Your niece? (chuckles) Right. So I assume you're, uh, you're here about Star? That little cow actually asked to have a three-way with me and my son. Look, I mean, what do you want me to do, huh? I gave you my word. I'm on it. But your real issue should be with Hunter, okay. He's attracted to a certain type of woman. He can't help himself. Neither can you. You want her just as much as he does. I see right through you. Look, what makes you think cutting her from the group is gonna break them up, anyway? She's a pathological narcissist. When she loses her footing, she's gonna throw a raging tantrum, and then her true, ugly colors will come through. You sure about that, hon? I know where all the bodies are buried. Don't make me dig 'em up. It reeks of s*x in here. (door shuts) So are you gonna fire Star? Hell no. That bitch is crazy. Look, no one's good enough for her son. He bankrolls her life. So what are you gonna do? What business is that of yours? I saw you bury a man, and you still can't trust me? No, listen, I got to deal with this. All right? I've got to take care of some stuff. (speaks Spanish) _ Yeah, I got to get her off my back, find a way to keep her away from Star. Maybe I can help with that. Man... She was good people, C. Her next lifetime, she gonna come back as a white woman. (chuckles) Hopefully a rich one. Hey, Ma, I think this salon is cursed. I mean, how many more bodies gonna drop around here? What you talking about, bodies dropping? Miss Bruce : What she talking about, C? Miss Jenkins died. You know, the choir director that had the stroke? Oh, damn. Good. She wore me out, anyway, honey. Every time you see her, all she want to talk about is them four grandsons of hers that's in jail. Bruce... (scoffs) (indistinct voices) (indistinct chatter) Simone, don't you even think about leaving this house. It's a peaceful protest. They always start off peaceful. Just remember, the Atlanta police department is not the highest authority, no matter what they think... God is. Now, you're grown, I can't stop you. But you're underage and you live in my house. So if you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Disrespectful little ass. Come on, let's get something to eat. No. You're not my mother. I'm gonna go sleep in Cotton's room. (quietly): Thank you, Father God, for everything that You are, and everything You continue to be. Amen. What you praying for? Danielle. And the eternal hell for her kids? The kids are gonna be just fine. How? They can't even find their father. They're gonna end up in the foster care system. You had nothing better else to do this morning than to come here and mess with my peace? (sighs) We're supposed to be singing in the rally, but Miss Carlotta won't let me go. Well, she's probably concerned about your safety. Derek says it's gonna be a peaceful protest. Supposedly. You know, I do a lot of work in this community, and you may come in with the most peaceful intentions, and things get crazy. Police brutality, rioting... Derek wants us to sing to lift people's spirits. That's God's work, too. Look, I... I'm not gonna get in between you and Carlotta. You know, that's not my place. Okay, see? That's why our country is in the state it's in. Because nobody's willing to stick up for nobody. You can go back to praying, Pastor. I hope it helps. ♪ These haters on my body shake 'em off ♪ 
♪ Hey ♪ 
♪ Ooh ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ Ooh ♪ 
♪ Hey ♪ 
♪ Ah, these haters on my body shake 'em off ♪ Eva. What are you doing here? Uh, it's about Star. Is she okay? Yeah, she's just very triste. Uh, because of her friend. Oh, yeah, I know. It's tragic. Yeah, you should do something to animarla. Ani what? Uh, give to her happiness. Okay, yeah. You got any ideas? Take her away a few days. Like a romantic getaway? ¿Porque no? (door buzzes) (door buzzes) Ed... how they treating you in here, bro? Same as they treated you. What's up? Arlene. She's out of control. Yeah, she is. She's showing her ass 'cause I'm in here. And you felt sorry for her when I used to knock her upside the head. She still come visit you? Yeah, every Saturday, like clockwork. And she still don't know? You think I'm gonna tell that bitch that she's the reason I'm here? That she's the one that put me behind bars? I tell her I love her, I miss her, I need her, and I can't wait to hug her again. (chuckling) Listen, man, I don't come visit you 'cause I know you don't like to chitchat, so, uh, I'll cut to the chase. I'm back in the game. Come on, man, music. You know that's my thing. And I'm onto something big. I got this girl group I just signed, and, yo, the lead girl, I'll tell you, you've never seen anything like it in your life. But here's the thing, she's dating your boy. And nobody's good enough for her boy. Arlene, she's gotta be checked. I mean, you got anything you can give me? Something on her? (Alexandra humming) These bags under my eyes are crazy. I haven't slept in days. How's the song coming? I finished it. I think I want you to sing the first verse. Why don't you or Simone sing it? Because I think it fits your voice. All right, cool. I'm going to Hunter's. He has some surprise for me. You know the rally's tonight? We need to rehearse. Okay. I'll be back at the rehearsal space later. Are we cool? Just don't be late. 
 
 ♪ It's okay... ♪ So, we good? Actually, no. What? I know you wasn't faking what we just did. No, I wasn't. I have needs, Carlotta. I'm a man, just like your son. Look... we're gonna figure this out. Simone wants to go to the rally. Well, you're just going from one uncomfortable subject to the next. She's got a lot of potential. Few do these days. I mean, you can't hate on that. No, what she is is a little con artist, going to you behind my back. The best thing you can do is show up for her. Support her. Try and make her feel like you're equal. Equal? She ain't paying no bills. Simone is different. She like her mother was. Just go to the rally. Support her. Stand with her, and you'll be able to keep your eyes on her. And how should I handle Cotton? I'm still praying on that one. (sighs) Look, come downstairs. I'm gonna make you some lunch. Well, why can't I have it here? You are something. Where's your sister? She said she'd be here. Simone : I keep texting her, but she's not answering. Eva : Hola. Um... ¿Star aquí? Oh, Star is definitely not aquí. She went off with her dumbass baller that she keeps on a very short leash. I think he has her on the leash. Leash? No entiendo. No te preocupes. How did I fall asleep? You needed the rest. You didn't sleep last night. Where are we and where are we going? It's a surprise. I don't like surprises, Hunter. Oh, my God, I'm so late for rehearsal. I was supposed to be there hours ago. How long have we been driving? Just a couple hours, maybe. A couple of hours? Where are we going? Jekyll Island. It's off the coast. Figured we'd get away a few days. (cell phone rings) Hello? Alexandra : Where the hell are you? Tonight's important. It's about Danielle. Yeah, no, I know I'm late. I'm on my way back, okay? On your way back? Yeah, I'm coming right now. You're not coming anywhere. Give me that. Hello? Hunter, give me my phone. Yeah, so, so, uh, she's taking the day off. Give me my phone. Stop playing with me! Alexandra : Star? Hello? Oh, my God! Hello? What is wrong with you?! Get back in the car. That phone cost me money. I'll buy you a new one. That's not the point. I know your type and I am not the one. Hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. No, no, it's not okay! Tell me what you want, I'll do it. I'll do it. I want you to drive me back to the city. All right. Star, okay, fine. I'll drive you back. This is supposed to be a three-part harmony. Can't you just rewrite it for two? No, there's no time. Someone needs to fill in. Can Cotton sing? Alexandra : You're joking, right? Simone : Okay, don't worry. Star's gonna get here. Alexandra : I knew this was gonna happen. Uh, I can try... until she comes. Girl, you sing? Mm, poquito. Okay. Let's hear something. ♪ Sun come up, ain't no change ♪ 
♪ Live to find a better way ♪ 
♪ Tears fall down till the morning light ♪ 
♪ Look to the sky ♪ 
♪ For a paradise. ♪ So, you've been holding out on us. Okay. But this is just until Star gets here, right? O-Of course. Simone : Yeah, I just don't want her to have any weird feelings about this. N... claro, no. Uh, me either. All right. Let's do this. Cool. Protesters (chanting) : Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Simone : If you're here to drag my ass home, you can forget about it. I'm not here for that, you little con artist. I know you went to the pastor behind my back. Yeah, well, it worked. You're here, ain't you? You know, your mom and me sang at a club during the L.A. riots. We barely made it out alive. I got a bad feeling about this thing. Danielle would not want you risking your lives like this. Protesters : Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Hey. Where's Star at? Alexandra : Where do you think? But it's okay, we have a backup. What do you mean, "backup"? Eva. Turns out she has mad pipes. Oh, is that right? Protesters : Say her name! Newswoman : As protesters rally outside of Atlanta's Zone 5 Police Station, we've just received this report: the police chief will now address the meeting... Protesters : Indict him! Indict him! Indict him! Indict him! Indict him! Everything all right? Derek : Just keeping an eye out. Can't let no outside agitators mess up what we're about now. Y'all good? Y'all ready? Protesters (chanting) : Indict him! Indict him! We want justice for Danielle Jackson. Yes! Yes! Right now! We want an indictment. Yes! Yes! Yes! And we will stay here for as long as we have to. Yes! Yes! Yes! Derek : Until the D.A. and the Atlanta Police Department do the right thing. (protesters cheering) Protesters : Indict him! Indict him! Indict him! Indict him! Indict... (chanting continues) Newswoman : ...calls that the officer involved in the shooting be indicted. Protesters : Indict him! Indict him! Indict him! Thank you, thank you, thank you, guys. If y'all can just quiet down for a little bit, please. I have a... a few ladies who have something to say. They were really close to Danielle Jackson and they got something to say that y'all should hear. Let's honor her and make these police say her name.

I can already tell you what he's gonna say. I'm not going anywhere. Neither am I. Where you think you going, Miss Thang? Get out of my way. I got a man waiting for me. Oh. You better quote Valley of the Dolls, bitch. Newswoman : This is breaking news. Turn that up. Chief Carl : Good evening. First and foremost, I'd like to extend my deepest sympathies to the family and the loved ones of Danielle Jackson. Extension, denied. ...gathering outside in her honor.

Regardless of what you feel about the information you're about to hear, you are expected to conduct yourselves in a civil manner and to observe the 10:00 p.m. curfew. After a thorough review of the traffic stop incident involving Danielle Jackson, there are no charges at this time. (protesters groan) Officer Dugan is suspended on paid leave. (protesters shouting) He got off? Well, what did you expect? (protesters shouting) Now let's get the hell out of here. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Well, if you were there, you would have known. We got stuck, and my phone was broken. I saw y'all at the protest, by the way, singing with Mamacita. She covered your ass. I didn't need my ass covered, I needed to be... Shut up! I'm trying to get through to Derek, all right? Good luck with that. He needs an attorney or something, right? Nah, just bail.

What y'all were trying to do was the right thing. Yeah, but we lost. No. That's not true. You win by speaking the truth, no matter what. Your music tonight... that was the truth. Sometimes I'm jaded, cynical, but I don't want you to become that way. I'm sorry. (car starting) Didn't Cotton go out tonight? Yeah, her date picked her up. Oh, wait, that's Alex. You want a drink? Whiskey. With what? Whiskey. (chuckles) So check this out. I went down to that, uh, that training gym... you know, that one down at Atlantic Station? What? That's crazy, if you ask me. Coke and the gym... at your age? It's gonna equal a heart attack. There's that, um... that equipment manager down there. What's his name? Roberto something? I don't know. Yeah, he and me had a pretty interesting conversation. Started talking about Hunter. It was funny... something... something about P.E.Ds? I have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah, you do. Performance-enhancing drugs? He said Hunter had been taking them for years. All those vitamin B12 shots? The shame of it is something like that gets out, it could end his career. You wouldn't do that to Hunter. Call my bluff. You got a lot of damn nerve. After I save your sorry-ass life, this is how you thank me? Get out of my house. Let me tell you something, you go talk to Maggie, and I will tell anyone who listens what you did to make your son a football star. What do you what? The whole deal is off. You're out. I'm taking those girls to the top, my way. (doorbell rings) I got it. What the hell is that? (police siren chirps) Where you coming from tonight? Home. License and registration? I don't have it on me. Step out of the vehicle. For what? Step out of the vehicle now. Don't make me ask you again. You got to be kidding me. You just pulled over the wrong girl. Put your hands against the vehicle. You can't profile me. I know my ri... Lassiter, easy. Stand down, Swiley. You're just gonna let him do this? Shut up. You're under arrest. For what? Yo, I said for what? Can't even tell. Stop, you're hurting me. (indistinct police transmission)
