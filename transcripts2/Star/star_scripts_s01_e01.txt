 Woman :  Ever since Star was little, she believed her name was who she was. 
 But I told her fame is a trip. 
 It ain't love, like a lot of people think. But she wouldn't listen. (distant cheering) Star don't listen to nobody but herself. ♪ ♪ 
♪ Who shot ya? ♪ 
♪ Who knocked ya? ♪ 
♪ Point 'em out, let 'em know I'm coming for 'em ♪ Yo, that sounds crazy. Think so? For real. I sounds so good. I'm not finished writing it, though. What do you have to add? I have to add your vocal at the end. Oh, I get it... Like a best for last sort of thing. Look, we have to get you out here to New York. Right. Like me going to New York is gonna happen any time soon. Do you see this place? Can you see it? Look. Look, you see her? That's what meth'll do to you. That's where I live. Well, we got to figure out something. This video chat thing is getting old. Okay, I get it. We should be in the same city if we're gonna do this for real. I'm telling you. First thing I'm gonna do when I turn 18 is go get my sister. You're gonna love her. She has a voice... almost as good as mine? Not quite? Wow, okay. Hey. Get in here and do these dishes, now. All right, got to go. Ursula's calling. She ain't worth the money we're getting for her. Mama, that ain't how you peel a potato. (sighs) Where'd you get that phone? Obama. Do them dishes now, smart ass. (heart beating) Dishes? Sink? Hello? Do them damn dishes. (heartbeat stops) Where are you going? Social services. Oh, no, you're not. I'm going to beg them to process me out of here. Oh, hell, no. Oh, you get back here right now. You better learn how to work that washing machine. Oh, God... how dare you speak to me like that, as much as I've done for you? Get your ass back right now... You want money from your trust for what? I met this girl on Instagram. She has a great voice, Dad. I mean, perfect for the songs I've been writing, and I just... The Internet? What-what girl? She's this white girl from Pittsburg. She grew up in foster care, and everything she's been through is in her voice. It's real, Dad. And we need to get in the studio. I want my money. Your money? So you want me to open up your trust fund for some white trash you met on the Internet? She's just using you to get to me. She doesn't even know about you. I made up an Instagram account with a different name. Oh, so you're ashamed of my name? So, I guess that means you're not gonna sing background for me, either, huh? You still don't get it. I need to break out on my own, Dad. I need to make music that feeds my soul. And my music don't? My soul, not yours. When's the last time you felt something when you sang your songs? You need to get back to your old stuff, Dad. Not this trash you've been trying. Who do you think you're talking to, you talentless brat? You sound just like your mother. (door opens, closes) Star, you've been through six foster families in the last two years. You're a thief, habitual liar, and you have no regard for rules. And you want what? Simone's address. You must out your mind. I'm about to be old enough to take care of her. All you got to do is tell me where she's at. Sit down. Please, just tell me where she is. It's not going to happen, Star. Why? 'Cause you've got a record. So you're not getting any information on a child in the system,  even if she was your sister. Rachel has a boyfriend. No, I don't. He's just a friend. Well, I hope so. Social worker :  You think it's any easier on the outside? Do you even have anywhere to go? Man :  Finish up, you two, or you're gonna be late for school. I'll take 'em. You can go to work and I'll just drop 'em off on my way. Oh, she think she running our house now. I guess that's what happens when you think you white. (girl giggles) But you ain't white, Simone. You ain't no better than anybody else in this house. I never said I was. Social worker :  Oh, you want to end up on the streets,  addicted, just like your mother? Don't talk about my mother. You finna make me call security again? We're not gonna end up like her. We're not, but you got to tell me where she is. I haven't seen her in five years, and she needs somebody to take care of her. Come on, kids, it's time for school. Miss Ruth, can you drop me off? Sure, come on. Oh, she ain't got no class till later. I'll take her to school. Clean up the kitchen. Star :  Do you know what the system  does to us? I know, Star. You know? Well, then let me see my sister. You gon' make me lose my job. They're gonna process you out of the system. And I better not hear my name out your mouth. One ticket to Harrisburg. Round trip? Hell no. Next time you see this face, it's gonna be on the cover of  Vanity Fair. Woman :  I've been looking for Star and her sister Simone for ten years now, ever since their mother passed and Social Services took 'em. Please help me find 'em. Those girls sing like angels. They need to be safe with each other under the same roof. (indistinct conversations) Simone? Miss Carlotta :  I can still hear 'em in my head, voices like their mama had. Hello? Hello? (bedsprings squeaking nearby) Man : Daddy's little girl. (Simone whimpering) Simone : You're hurting me. (moaning) (tweeting) (shushes quietly) ♪ ♪ Star! Oh, my God, stop it! Stop it! You killed him!

The music scene there is rancid. Where we gon' live? There's this lady named Miss Carlotta. She's been writing letters to Social Services saying she's our godmother. We still got family left? I guess. At least a place to crash. Hello? Star : Hey, it's me. I got a TracFone, so I don't have a lot of time to talk, but I just left Pittsburg, and I'm with my sister. We're headed to Atlanta and we got a place to crash. Atlanta? Are you in or not? ♪ ♪ What do you want? It's okay. Good morning, Alexandra. Morning. Thanks, Charles. Hello. Damn girl, you straight off a page of  Vogue. But you are shorter than I thought. And you're heavier than I thought. Oh, my God. I can't believe I'm doing this. Star : No second thoughts, girl. You're the special hot in the sauce. What's going on with her? Never mind. Let's just do this. (giggles) I'm not getting my stuff stolen in this dive. You're actually ridiculous. Well, everything ain't Fendi and Prada, Alexandra. You need to let your weave down, girl. (scoffs) Oh, Blondie. This is real. Not all black girls wear weaves.

No. But I'm glad you saved me. I mean, the music we're making... It's my new life. I'm not going back. Your parents cool with that? How come you never mention them? My dad's a surgeon. He likes going around talking about how many lives he's saved. My mom's dead. At least you got a dad. Yo... (music stops) This is so dope. Like... like, for real, I can't even take it.

(laughs) Simone, what did I tell you? It's the only undershirt I got, unlike Princess Peach over here. I told you that everything about our life has to go. I meant everything. I killed that man for us. Now we can focus on our dream. Our  dream? Your dream. Take that shirt off. I'm not taking it off. This has his blood on it, and I like it 'cause he's dead. I'm free.

Two minutes. I'm gonna come with you. I just said two minutes? What, do you think I'm gonna eat you or something? Bitch, all you eat is greens. Mm. Hmm. (door bells tinkle, indistinct chatter) (chatter stops) Is Carlotta here? You find us on Groupon or something? Let me see who the little white girl is, hold on. Yeah, we'd be lucky to get on Groupon. Carlotta's my mama. She ain't here. She at church. Oh, okay. Well, when is she back? Why you want to know? Oh, you one of Mary's girls. Baby, Carlotta about to gag, honey.

You know how hard we worked for this. Miss C, please. Okay, boy. Get out of here. Well, it's much appreciated. Y'all ladies have a nice day. Bye. Come on, y'all. Say, bye, Derek. Mm-mm, mm-mm. So... you're like our new mother now? Your foster parents treating you all right? Yeah. Simone and I both got real lucky. And what kind of foster care you come from? I'm actually not from a foster family. My parents just think traveling is a real learning experience. And we heard the music scene in Atlanta was crazy. And we're a girl group. Me and your mother had a group before y'all were born. We even had a song hit the charts. What? That's crazy. What was the name of the group? Was she pretty? Look, y'all want to sing. Why don't you come sing with me in Church? "Church"? Yes, you little witch. Church. Look, why are y'all really here? You looking to stay with me? Yes. Okay, then. Well, let's get home. We got a busy week ahead of us. What does that mean? You want to stay with me, you got to contribute. My shampoo girl got pregnant and quit... again. You know how to shampoo hair? She do. Grab my keys. I'm going. I'm not shampooing anyone's hair. I got a sick plan. You just got to learn how to be a part of it. Just come on. This is my wax room. Clean it up, and y'all can take the bed or the floor. The bed or the floor, huh? Can I, can I sleep in your room? You don't want to sleep with the other girls? They're just gonna be singing all night and stuff. I thought you wanted to sing. (mumbles) Come on, I got a daybed you could sleep in. But don't be snoring. I got to get my rest.

The real question is, why are we rehearsing when we ain't got no gigs? So when we do have a gig, we're ready. That's right. They said we would end up like Mama. That's not gonna happen. I miss her. Well, you got me. Come on, let's start rehearsing. Get on this side. What are you doing? I'm standing in the middle. I sing lead. There is no lead. I wrote this song to showcase all of our voices. Where do you want me? You want me here, or, like, one inch over? Are we rehearsing? (clucks tongue) Or no? (laughter) Miss Bruce, I am loving this splash of color. What's the inspiration? Girl, Rihanna, Charlize Theron mixed with Lupita Nyong'o, honey. I got a taste for some grits. 
 
 Women : Morning, Miss Carlotta. Hi. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. God is good. Ain't He, though? Yes. All day. You got some kind of problem, Star? (chuckles) Star don't feel like working. Star will get past that. Oh, my God! (gasps) Oh, my God! What happened? I just burned myself on this busted-ass sink. What's wrong with you, girl? Carlotta, you got a white girl in here messing up my hair. Really? Roberta. I'm out of here. Hey, Roberta, you still got to pay. Bruce : Carlotta, I don't know why you let that little Caucasian to work in here. She can't even work a shampoo ball, nasty attitude. Always something wrong with her. What did you just say, bitch? Say it one more time for me. I'm really, really tired of you two Bible-thumping whores... yes, you... Coming in here and talking about me every single day. See, that's my cue. Bye. Why is that you think you know anything about me, where I was raised, who raised me, who was good to me, black or white? Star. 'Cause of what I look like? Come on upstairs. Let's talk. You're a racist... bitch. And now that you finished, bitch your little ass right on out the door. (door closes) Mouth just like her mother's. What was our mother like, Miss Carlotta? Am I just like her? You high, ain't you? Come on, let's walk that buzz off. I'm going to Church. I'll tell you all about your mama. Mail that for me. Star, we've been here for over a week. I've been shampooing goat hair, sleeping in a bed with you and living off of fried apple pies. What we need to do is get in the studio and lay some tracks. But this woman's in here working us like dogs. Look, we got to figure this out, or I got to go. Oh. (laughs) Go! Go back to New York City. I've got nowhere to go. All I've been doing is trying to figure this out. And all we got to do is get to Jay Z or Future or 50's tired ass. I don't care. They're not just sitting in a room waiting for us. We need to build some kind of a buzz. Get our faces out there. (toilet flushes) Star : You mean, like, online or something? Now, I've been looking into amateur nights. There's a contest that I saw online in Decatur. There's industry people there. Managers, too. You have to trust me on this. When did you say the contest was? It's tonight. Which means we need to get cute after work. (both laugh) Get off the damn stage! Put-put the mikes down, please. Put the mike... It's... This ain't for you. This rap thing ain't for you. Ladies and gentlemen, the next act we're gonna bring to the stage is three young ladies who traveled a long way Simone. To be here with us.

Miss Carlotta says singing for the Lord could save all of us. Star... let's get saved. There's something wrong with you, Simone. Ain't nothin' wrong with me. Miss Carlotta really loves us, Star. She wants to be our new mother. I'm a little over new mothers, aren't you? You're not singing in anybody's choir. And the only person who's gonna save us is that manager. Where's my weed? Oh, my God. Star, this is getting nuts. It's okay. It's cool. You ain't got to worry about me. All that stuff in the past is in the past. Working from home now? (door creaking) We made an agreement. I kept my part. About what? Huh? You're tangling in my life again, and I'm not having it. That's Mary's kid. Who? Star. Damn. The minute I heard that girl sing, it made me feel exactly the way I felt when I first heard Mary. I'm not interested in your feelings. I'm interested in how you can afford $10,000 watches. I know this is all smoke and mirrors. You sitting on money in Peru. I think Star could learn a lot from you. She's good. Lottie, I'm telling you right now, she's really good, and... if those other girls are half as talented as she is, we got the makings of a super group. You could tell all that to the D.A., 'cause that's exactly who I'm finna call if you don't stay away from them. I killed myself to make you and Mary stars. I bet everything I had on you dumb bitches, and you blew it. Mary with the drugs, and you... gaining all that weight, never showing up on time, acting like an amateur. And who paid for that? Me. My career. And now you're gonna come up in here, you're gonna try to derail me again? No. You know what? (sighs) My father always said to me, you only need three things in life. Oh, yeah? What did your daddy say. He said you needed... (sniffs) your Bible... your word... and your gun. Stay away from those girls. (door opens) That drag queen can sew her little ass off. She ain't a drag queen, stupid. She's trans. Star : We got to hurry. Carlotta'll be back from that Bible study any minute. We gonna slay today. Yeah, we are. My butt looks good. (laughs): It does. You'll slay if you're sober... and coherent. (clicks tongue) I'm sick of your ass. Star : Simone. No, I'm sick of her ass. She thinks she's the boss. And you think you're the boss, dragging my ass all around Atlanta! Dragging your ass? Yeah, dragging it. I saved your ass. Yeah, well, save it now. All right, take it easy. You got two seconds. Always arguing. Do you want to change our lives today? Scooch over. So, how is that boy? What boy? Derek. Mr. Light-Skinned Matter. (laughs) Star : She'll be okay. ♪ ♪ Hunter : Hey! My man! I'm Arlene. His mother. It's my house. Hunter, these are the girls I told you about. That right there is Simone, this one here is Alexandra, and that one right there, that's Star. You guys are gonna be performing in the other room. Anybody want a drink? A drink wouldn't kill me. Jahil : All right, one drink, you hear me? Then meet me in the living room. Come here, girl. Come on. Girl, let me see this. Hey, I want to see more of what we got going here. Whoa. Where's Simone? This tastes like apple juice. You got scotch? I mean... any jackass can run up and down a field, toss a ball. But to sing? To take someone inside your soul? Speaking of balls... you been throwing some pretty big ones this season. Oh-ho, I have, have I? (laughs) They are pretty big. Where's your bathroom? Upstairs. ♪ ♪ There's lipstick on my glass. What are we gonna do? You're gonna help me up. That's what you're gonna do.
