 Okay, so this is what happened before on Star... 
 Simone, have you seen your father? 
 I didn't know you had such a lovely daughter, Carlotta. 
 You wouldn't think she had a daughter at all. 
 Cotton is a man. He's my baby boy. 
 I asked if I could trust you. 
 And I asked if you were sure you wanted to give me your credit card. 
 You a hustler. 
 Just like you. 
 Alexandra :  We have a backup. Turns out she has mad pipes. 
 Crowd (chanting) : No justice, no peace. 
 No crooked police. 
 Derek : This is not what we're about! 
 Crowd : No justice, no peace. 
 No crooked police. 
 You got the wrong guy. 
 Step out of the vehicle. 
 You can't profile me. 
 I know my rights. 
 Carlotta :  "Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance." 
 Man : Alexandra Crane, you're being released. 
 How are you doing? 
 How do you think I'm doing? 
 My partner was out of line last night. 
 We're not all like that. 
 Hey, I'm sorry. 
 Mom? 
 Look at your face. 
 Who did this to you? Who did this to her?! 
 Alexandra : What are you doing here? 
 I posted bail. Moses called me. 
 You could have called me first. 
 I'm sorry, Alex. 
 So much for attorney/client privilege. 
 Not when I'm footing the bill. 
 I'm gonna take care of your release papers. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 Alexandra, I want to know everything. 
 I'm fine, Mom. 
 All I'm worried about right now is Derek. 
 I knew that boy was behind this. 
 We're going home now. 
 Carlotta : Alex. 
 I trusted you, Carol. 
 My name is Carlotta. 
 I told her this would happen. 
 Get off her! You've done enough damage. 
 Hey, ladies, you do realize you're in a police station? 
 And what? 
 You gonna beat me, too? 
 I was just leaving. 
 Carlotta : Derek's getting arraigned. 
 I'll be at the courthouse. 
 I'm going with you. 
 Alexandra. 
 Look at your face. You're all banged up. 
 I'll talk to you later. 
 Alexandra!

 Where y'all going so early? 
 Did you hear something about Derek and Alex? 
 Cotton : Alexandra just got out, and we're about to meet her at Derek's arraignment. 
 Let me get changed and go with you. Why didn't you tell me? 
 Girl, why would she want to see you, Star? 
 I don't know, 'cause we sleep in the same damn bed... why wouldn't she? 
 Because you didn't show up for the rally, Star. 
 It's starting to get really boring. 
 Simone, that wasn't my fault. 
 Whatever. 
 You and Alex are sisters, right, with Eva? 
 Okay, we didn't have any choice but to use Eva, and I don't understand why you're so threatened by her anyway. 
 I'm not threatened. 
 You should know better than that, Simone. 
 She has nothing on me. 
 Simone, are you being serious right now? 
 Simone (whispering) : Hey, sorry, excuse me. 
 Hey, y'all, what's up? 
 Hey. 
 Alex, what the hell? 
 It's fine. 
 Girl, you in jail? 
 I ain't even been there yet. 
 Shut up, Cotton. 
 Bailiff : All rise. 
 The Honorable Judge Diaz presiding. 
 Now hearing  Derek Jones v. The State of Georgia. 
 Please be seated. 
 Judge : Mr. Jones, you're being charged with one count of inciting a riot, one count of resisting arrest, and one count of aggravated assault involving a police officer. 
 How do you want to plead? 
 Not guilty. 
 Given you have no priors, I'm setting the bail at $250,000. 
 Your legal counsel will go over bail bond procedures if you choose to exercise that option. 
 Trial date to be set at the next hearing. 
 No, no, he didn't do it. 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 Judge : Order. Order. Order! 
 Bailiff : Sit down. Sit down! 
 Sit down. 
 No, this isn't fair. 
 (excited chatter) 
 Judge : Order! 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Hello. 
 Yo, what up, baby? It's Conny. 
 Hey, brother, what's going on? 
 I was talking on the phone with a friend of mine who says that... your girls are in this Atlanta NextFest competition that he's judging. 
 Yeah, yeah, that-that's right. 
 Just checked out the video y'all got on the Web site. 
 You didn't tell me you got rid of that blonde and put this Latina hottie in, though. 
 No, no, uh, I didn't. 
 Wait, you said a video on the Atlanta NextFest Web site? 
 Yeah. 
 Hold on, let me check it out. 
 ♪ Make me wanna holler ♪ 
♪ The way they do my life I wanna holler ♪ 
 Damn, it's a hit. 
 (music off) 
 I'll tell you what, man, that new girl is fire. 
 Put that little  mami  in, then we in business. 
 I want in on this, Jahil. 
 Listen, I like where you're going with this, man. 
 Thanks for looking out. I appreciate it, brother. 
 Why don't we try to set a meeting, we can discuss it? 
 Yeah, as long as you give me what I want. 
 (laughs) 
 Same old Conny. 
 I'll get back to you, brother. 
 Buddy of mine. 
 He's in tight with one of the judges from the Atlanta NextFest. 
 He said somebody uploaded a video of you singing with the girls at the rally, told me that if I needed an edge, maybe, that you might be the ticket. 
 Mm. 
 You know, the whole... 
 Latin angle thing,  ¿tú sabe? 
 Mm. Who would have ever thought of it? 
 You know, you might be right. 
 And we could tap into a whole new demographic. 
 That Latin market is huge. 
 And adding a fourth voice to the group could be just the thing we need. 
 I'm gonna add you to the group. 
 Star's not gonna like that. 
 (scoffs) She better suck it up. 
 I heard about Derek. 
 I still can't believe it. 
 $250K, and he's innocent. 
 That sound about right. 
 You know, to be so educated, you sure is stupid. 
 Ten percent, dumb-ass. 
 Ten percent go to the bail bondsman. 
 Alex. 
 I'm okay. 
 Where's Derek? 
 Yo, we got to get him out of there. 
 This is crazy. 
 Carlotta : Yeah, that's gonna be hard. 
 Ain't nobody got $25,000 laying around. 
 Star : Yo, I got it. 
 We could do a block party fund-raiser. 
 We could perform. 
 Simone : You know what? You're right, Star. 
 We can raise this bail bond money by charging some sort of entry fee or something. 
 I'll fry some chicken. 
 I might be able to get them old nosy neighbors of yours to get off they sorry asses and do something. 
 (chuckles) 
 Okay, so what song are we thinking of doing? 
 I really wanted to be there. 
 Last night at the rally, I really did. 
 I was going through something. 
 What were you going through? 
 Alexandra, I'd like to speak to you in private. 
 Oh, my God, she's back. 
 He's in there right now, and I don't know what to do. 
 I'm telling you right now, forget about that boy. 
 I know all about loving a messed-up man, like your father. 
 Derek is nothing like Dad. 
 Yes, he is, darling. He wants the spotlight, too. 
 He just wants it in a different way. 
 You don't even know him to say that. 
 I'll pay this boy's bail if you leave this zoo. 
 I'm not just gonna abandon him. 
 Right now I feel like I'm doing something that's important and real to me. 
 Besides, I don't need your money. 
 Miss Carlotta and the girls are throwing me a block party fund-raiser. 
 You really believe these people are gonna pay for him to get out? 
 I mean, for God's sake, Alexandra, they can't even afford to pay attention. 
 Let Moses help. 
 He's been our family lawyer for ages. 
 Okay. 
 African-American male, six-three, weighing approximately 210. 
 Single bullet wound to the chest, and by the recent stab wound on his back, I'd say this is personal. 
 I'll run his DNA through the system. 
 Shouldn't be too long before we get an I.D. on this guy. 
 Got some new fish up in here! 
 (banging on bars) 
 What's up, boy? 
 Come on, pretty boy. 
 (door opens) 
 Alexandra : Derek. 
 Uh-uh. 
 No contact. 
 Moses : I just got the report about the officer. 
 This isn't good. 
 If you're lucky, they'll offer you a plea deal with a minimum of five years. 
 Alexandra : But he's innocent, Moses. 
 BLM would never do anything like this. 
 Are they even trying to find the goons that crashed the rally? 
 Look, unless somebody comes forward with new evidence, you're their number one suspect. 
 Could you give us a moment, sir? 
 Sure. 
 No contact! 
 That plea deal... 
 I might consider that. 
 Are you insane? 
 That's like admitting you're guilty. 
 I mean, they know other people are involved. 
 Something will come up, a video or something. 
 Alex, stop it... it's me up against a bunch of pissed off cops. 
 I won't have a fair trial. 
 They've been after me for months. 
 Derek, look at all you've fought for. 
 You'd give that up now? 
 It's already been decided, baby girl. 
 It's how the system works. 
 When I met you... you said that you were gonna save the world. 
 But you can't even save yourself. 
 Maybe you're not who I thought you were. 
 Maybe I'm not.

 Couple times.

 Why are you asking me? 
 Mm. 
 You a sometimey bitch. 
 And you got a big-ass head. 
 (laughs) 
 'Sup? 
 How's Derek? 
 His head's getting twisted, talking about taking a plea deal. 
 That's what they do to you, man. 
 They're trying to get in his head. 
 We can't raise $25K at a block party. 
 We got to try. 
 (scoffs) 
 (quietly): Her mom can help. 
 What about your mom? 
 Why don't you ask her for some help? 
 Never. 
 Hmm. Well, I wonder who else has got money. 
 Who? No. 
 No, I can't. 
 His mama's still mad about that shopping spree. 
 You know the last thing I ever want to do is beg you. 
 But I'm desperate here. 
 I mean, you can at least ask. 
 Right? 
 I cannot believe I'm about to help your super rich ass. 
 Bring it in. 
 Ha, ha. 
 Oh... 
 Ah... 
 What is this? 
 It's called kindness. 
 I hate it. 
 Oh, it's weird. 
 Get off of me. 
 Ugh! 
 Okay. I hate it, too. 
 Good afternoon, ladies. 
 Alex, you doing all right? 
 Good. 
 Anyway, listen. Somebody actually posted a video of your performance on the Atlanta NextFest Web site. 
 And I'm telling you right now, the reaction to it, the response has been off the charts. 
 I've never seen anything like it. 
 Oh, my God. 
 There are 30,000 views on this. 
 I'm not even in this. That's not okay. 
 Alexandra : 30,000 overnight? 
 Oh, my gosh. That's so dope. 
 Alexandra : Yeah. It is dope. 
 Can we have a word? 
 Get on the phone and tell them to take that video down right now. 
 If you want to continue being our manager, you would've already done it by now. 
 Look, Star. 
 30,000 likes is no joke. 
 Okay? That video is on fire. 
 Besides, the judges have already seen it. 
 And you know what? I got a plan. 
 If your plan doesn't involve getting that video pulled, I'm not interested in hearing it. 
 Star. 
 Star! 
 (Cotton laughs) 
 Cotton :  I had a really good time tonight, Elliot. 
 I can't remember the last time I laughed so much.

 He does know, and he likes all of it. 
 Cotton, wait. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. I just been on edge since this whole riot thing, and Danielle, and... 
 It's just... (sighs) 
 Look, I know you're saving up for the surgery and everything, but can't you just... put it off? 
 You know Derek could really use that money. 
 Derek? 
 You gonna slap me in my face and turn around and ask me for my money, for Derek? 
 No. 
 I already scheduled my s*x change surgery for next week. 
 So no. 
 Praise the Lord. 
 You know, Derek's in jail. 
 We're trying to raise the $25K for his bail bond by having this block party fund-raiser. 
 I figured, since you're an NFL player... hometown pride or whatever... you might want to donate to a good cause. 
 (water running in bathroom) 
 
 
 
 $5K, $10K or something? 
 Isn't that called, like, a tax write-off for people like you? 
 I guess you were just waiting until you got me into a vulnerable position to ask me for money, huh? 
 No. That's not what I'm saying. 
 I mean, you must just think I'm some dumb rich jock you can easily play. 
 Hunter, you're trippin' right now. 
 I mean, is that all I am to you? 
 Huh? A side hustle? 
 You know, you're just like all the other gold-digging sluts I've ever had. 
 Here, you, you want some money? Huh? 
 You want some money? Here. Take some money. 
 Here, take it. Take some money. 
 Take the money. 
 Take it. Take some money. 
 You know what? 
 Take this $10K and buy your ugly-ass mama another tanning booth, you mama's bitch! 
 Arlene : What's going on in here? 
 (door closes) 
 How'd it go with Hunter? 
 We'll find another way. We always do. 
 You okay, sexy? 
 No. 
 Tell me what's wrong. 
 It's all good. 
 Weren't we just supposed to start a girl group? 
 (chuckles) 
 (chuckles) 
 Now look at us. 
 I just got arrested. 
 Star's a friggin' WAG. 
 Somebody killed Otis. 
 You forgot the whole loony bin part. 
 Do you think Destiny's Child ever went through something like this? 
 Nah. 
 Now, TLC? 
 (laughter) 
 They for sure did. 
 (laughter) 
 Ah... 
 It's all good. 
 We still got our eye on the prize. 
 Let's go. We have so much to do for this block party.

 All right, so I got a special guest who wants to say a few words before y'all start shaking your asses. 
 Y'all know him as the quarterback for our beloved Talons. 
 He is the very legendary, the very talented, incomparable Hunter Morgan!

 What up? 
 Yeah! 
 Y'all looking real good, I see y'all. 
 So, look, I came out here from Cali just to talk to y'all. 
 Now, tonight is about raising money for a community hero, Derek Jones. 
 Right? 
 (applause) 
 'Cause y'all see what's going on out here in these streets. 
 Gunning people down like animals. 
 (crowd assents) 
 And I think it's messed up that they trying to do him dirty like that. 
 (crowd assents) 
 And personally, I'm sick and tired of seeing injustices play out the way they do with our young brothers. 
 (crowd assents) 
 But, see, Derek, he one of the lucky ones. 
 He's still alive. 
 And even though he's locked up right now, he has a chance. 
 So I'm asking all of y'all, 'cause y'all looking real good, to dig deep into your pockets, your wallets, Gucci bags, whatever you got to help his cause. 
 I truly appreciate y'all. 
 Thank you. Thank you.

 Thank you for coming. Have a good night. 
 Thank you for giving.

 I know you're doing what you got to do.

 You're still my baby. 
 I love you, Mom. 
 I love you, too. 
 You know, I want us to get a blessing. 
 I'm gonna call Pastor Harris and see if he'll come over and just talk to us. 
 I know you don't do church. 
 But I know you know the Lord, Cotton. 
 Okay, Mama.

 Alexandra. 
 Mom, you were right. 
 I want to come home. 
 I'm not cut out for this life. 
 Well, what changed your mind? 
 Derek's talking about taking a plea. 
 It's stupid. 
 Mom, I don't think I want that type of guy. 
 But I do want to help him before I leave. 
 His bail is short. 
 You told me, if I'd come home, you'd help him. 
 Help him. 
 I'm coming home. 
 Okay. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 You came to your senses. 
 We can be wheels up at 10:00 a.m. sharp. 
 I'll be ready. 
 Wonderful. 
 I'll set it up. 
 Hey, Sprocket. 
 I love you, my darling. 
 I love you, too. 
 All right, Jahil, we'll see you in a minute. 
 Jahil wants us to meet him at the studio in, like, an hour. 
 Oh... 
 All done. 
 Where's Alex? 
 I don't know. 
 She left earlier this morning and didn't say where she was going.

 Oh, there's Prince Charming. 
 Well, I got to go shower and get ready. 
 All right, find Alex and tell her to meet us later. 
 Okay. 
 What are you doing here? Please leave. 
 I haven't slept, and I'm a wreck, and I really, really need to talk. 
 So talk. 
 I know there's no excuse for what I did... and I don't know what happened. I just snapped. 
 I've never done anything like that before. 
 And I guess I've just been burned by so many crazy bitches that I just lost it... and I'm... I'm so sorry. 
 So, you thought you could bring me Pumpkin and it would all be forgiven? 
 Because no. 
 I know that that will never be enough of an apology... and I don't expect for you to, to forgive me just like that. 
 What I'm asking for is another chance. 
 I can't do that right now. 
 Where are you going? 
 For a walk. 
 Alone. 
 Cotton, 20 years ago, I broke off my relationship with God. 
 I was in this exact place. 
 The church was no place for a sinner like me. 
 I asked for God to put forgiveness in my heart, and only through prayer, I was led back to God. 
 I'm doing this for my mother. 
 Harris : And she appreciates you for it. 
 I'm going to ask that you... join my hand in prayer. 
 Hold on, let me get my Bible. 
 Here, hold my hand in prayer. 
 Bow our heads as we pray. 
 Dear Lord, forgive us for our failures. 
 Guide this mother and child relationship the way it ought to be. 
 Yes. 
 I call on you, Lord, as I pray. 
 This young soul has been lost for so long. 
 Please, God, bring Arnold back to his mother. 
 Let Arnold renounce this gender confusion... and purge him of sin. 
 As Deuteronomy 22:5 says: 
 "A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear woman's clothing, for the Lord, your God, detest anyone who does this." 
 Please, Father God... refute the demons inside this child. 
 Open your heart. 
 Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior? 
 I don't know. Yes, I want to. 
 Do you accept the Lord as your savior? 
 Say it right now. 
 Say it! 
 (crying): Yes, yes, I accept God. 
 Your name is Arnold. 
 You were born a man. 
 "I am a man." Say it. 
 Say it! 
 "I am a man. 
 My name is Arnold." 
 Say it with conviction. 
 Believe it from your heart. Say it! 
 (gasping) 
 "I am a man." 
 I'm not a... 
 "I am a man." Say it. 
 (crying): Am I... I'm not... 
 Am I... am I, am I a man, Mama?

 Harris : Thank you, Father God. 
 Thank you, Father. 
 Don't touch me. Get off me. 
 (crying): You set me up. 
 (crying) 
 I was just trying to help. 
 Get out. 
 Get out. 
 You asked for my help! 
 You did! 
 Both of y'all are confused. 
 (door slams) 
 (cries softly) 
 (crying) 
 (door opens) 
 Do it. 
 Pull the trigger, you stupid bitch. 
 What is wrong with you? Put that gun down. 
 Put that gun down. 
 Cotton. 
 You know how nasty your room would've looked if you had pulled that stunt? 
 I would've had to clean blood out of these glitter curtains. 
 (laughs weakly) 
 Are you laughing? 
 (laughs) 
 What happened? 
 I can't believe my ma would do that to me. 
 But at least you got a mama, I guess, crazy. 
 Is Simone rubbing off on me? 
 I think so. 
 (laughs) 
 (both laughing) 
 Rose : Where are you, dear? You should've been here an hour ago. 
 I'm not coming. 
 What do you mean you're not coming? 
 Moses posted bail for that boy. 
 I realized something, Mom. 
 I've never felt this way about anybody in my life, and I can't just leave. 
 Alexandra, we had a deal! 
 Yeah, just like all those times you made deals to take me to  The Nutcracker  if I poured you one last drink, but you were too drunk. I never saw it. 
 Or how you and Dad made a deal to launch my solo career, but Dad squashed it 'cause he didn't want me on his label. 
 This is exactly what I was talking about, the influence of those street girls they have on you... 
 Please, Mom. 
 I learned these street smarts on my own. 
 Besides, ten grand is like a Chanel bag for you. 
 Don't worry, I'll pay you back. 
 You really love that boy, Alexandra? 
 Yeah. I really do. 
 Mark my words, he'll break your heart. 
 I'll call you back later. 
 (Derek groans) 
 Harris : "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." 
 Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. 
 Who am I to judge? 
 (crying) 
 We ran your John Doe's DNA. 
 It came back a match to the one in a car. 
 We ran the plates and it's a rental. 
 Last rented to an Otis Leecan. 
 Otis Leecan? 
 I have an open case on him. 
 Looks like we got our John Doe. 
 Derek's still got to go to trial, but at least he's out. 
 I still can't believe you pulled that on your mom. 
 I didn't think you had it in you. 
 I did. 
 Thank you. 
 (laughs) 
 I'm glad you guys are here. 
 What is she doing here? 
 Is this about Atlanta NextFest? 
 This better only be about handling what we discussed. 
 Look, I wanted to talk to you all earlier, but I didn't really get a chance. 
 So, here's the deal. 
 I have an inside source at the Atlanta NextFest. 
 The competition is a lot more fierce than I thought, and I'm not really feeling like I want to lose this thing. 
 I'm expanding our audience. 
 I'm adding Eva to the group. 
 Okay. 
 I quit. 
 What's the deal with all the cops? 
 They're searching around. 
 Questioning us. 
 This whole thing could blow up in our faces. 
 You're being considered as a person of interest in the murder of Otis Leecan. 
 You can't keep me in here like this. 
 Do I need a lawyer? 
 This is not going away, Talk to me. 
 I think we found what we were looking for. 
 You're lying.
