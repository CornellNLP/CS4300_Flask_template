 Okay, so this is what happened before on  Star. 
 (Simone gasps) 
 You killed him! 
 I met this girl on Instagram. 
 They need a manager like me. 
 Unless you get her hooked on drugs like you did Mary. 
 Mama, we was just at the club. 
 Stop lying, boy. 
 Girl,  Mama. 
 There's a big music festival coming here to Atlanta. 
 You got to submit a demo, and the deadline is in two days. 
 If you want to manage us,  show me the money. 
 I need a job, I need something. 
 Maggie :  You'll get haltonight, along with instructions. 
 I do know you got to tell them girls the truth about you and Mary. 
 I want Mama. 
 Mama's dead. 
 Harris :  Simone, when you gonna sing for us?

 Status? 
 16-year-old female, upon arrival was unresponsive to painful stimuli. Hypoxic, hypotensive. 
 (long, droning beep) 
 We just lost the pulse. 
 One, two, three. 
 (rhythmic beeping) 
 Start CPR. 
 Woman : You're gonna have to wait outside. 
 You just... you go outside, okay? 
 Pupils are reactive. 
 Normal saline, wide open. 
 (loud, droning beep) 
 Draw a rainbow. 
 (beep continues) 
 Woman : Let's prepare to intubate, people. 
 Hold CPR. Check the rhythm. 
 ♪ There's a light... ♪ 
 Woman : Do we have a pulse? 
 V-fib. Continue CPR. 
 Shock at 200, please.

 My publicist called from New York. 
 Alexander Crane plus one.

 Yes. You have a good night, mama, yes, you do. 
 Yes, you do!

 Alexandra : Big! What's up?! 
 Hey, Ali! 
 (laughing): What's up? 
 What's up? What's up, girl? 
 Your dad kno you were here? 
 Yeah, I'm doing my own music now. 
 He's excited. 
 Excited? 
 I'm Star. We sing together. 
 We're in a group. 
 There's three of us. 
 Star : My sister's in it, too, but she's not here right now. 
 She's at church, praying for our Grammy. 
 She can sing her ass off, trust me. 
 Her sister can, too. We're about to do our first demo. 
 I want you to produce it. 
 I would, but I got to go out of town tomorrow. 
 I'm going on tour. 
 Oh, that's perfect. Tomorrow works for us. 
 We got a deadline anyway. 
 Deadline? 
 We're entering the Atlanta Next Best. We only have two more days. 
 Oh, so you just so happened to bump into me at the club tonight. 
 Maybe we can work something out. 
 All right. 
 I think that's a yes. Can I get a selfie? 
 Hold up. In a minute. 
 Oh. 
 That was my personal space. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 We got this. 
 (indistinct female voice over P.A.) 
 Why ain't she calling me back? 
 She thinks you're mad at her. 
 Well, now I am. 
 I'll call the bitch. 
 She ain't gonna bounce a call on me. 
 Are you the mother? 
 Yes, I am. 
 She was in cardiac arrest, but we successfully resuscitated her. 
 Thank you, Jesus. 
 Any idea of where she got ahold of those drugs? 
 No, I have no idea, but I'll find out. 
 When can I see her? 
 The next 24 hours will be critical, so we're admitting her in the hospital for further observation. 
 The nurse'll let you know when you can see her. 
 You ever bring that garbage in my house again, we are done. 
 (sighs) 
 Man :  Hi, you. 
 Man. 
 Man, I figured you was dead or in prison. 
 Not yet. Hey, congratulations, man. 
 It looks like business is booming. 
 Yeah, well, I can't complain. 
 Like the color green. 
 Who don't? 
 (laughing): Don't come in here asking me for any money. 
 I... 
 Hey, man, it's nothing like that. 
 Check it out. 
 I got a new act. 
 A girl group. 
 (laughing): A girl...? Oh, this is 1985? 
 Conny, I'm telling you right now, man, they're gonna be huge. 
 For real. I mean, pow. 
 (sniffles) 
 Look... if it ain't happened for you yet, man, I... it ain't gonna happen, baby. 
 Hey, Conny, check this out. 
 Who took care of you when you were a P.A., huh? 
 So don't act like I never did you a solid before. 
 We're on a deadline, and they need a demo. 
 And you want what... Free studio time? 
 Come on, Jahil. 
 I ain't looking for a handout. 
 I'm asking for your help. 
 Who you done robbed, man? 
 (scoffs) 
 All right. 
 I got a client that only works in the daytime. 
 Your girls can take the night shift tomorrow night. 
 I'll take it. 
 Hey, I like the red. 
 Your daughter's full legal name? 
 Simone. 
 Brown. 
 Woman : Age 16. 
 Frequent drug use. 
 Any history of psychiatric problems? 
 I don't think so, no. 
 You don't think so. 
 She's a teenager. They... they all crazy. 
 Well, we're trying to determine if this was an overdose or a suicide attempt. 
 She has been waking up having nightmares. 
 Waking up screaming and stuff. 
 I'll need to make a copy of your insurance card. 
 I don't have insurance right now. 
 The emergency room alone is going to cost over $5,000. 
 Obamacare has some very affordable options for low-income families. 
 Who said we were low-income? 
 (ringtone playing) 
 Yo, Simone, we just got Big Boi to produce our demo. 
 How crazy is that? 
 Where you at? My mama been calling you all night. 
 Huh? 
 Why do you have my sister's phone? Where's Simone? 
 Hello? Please, where's my sister? 
 (siren blaring) 
 Ma'am, you're gonna have to calm down. 
 I need to know where... 
 Is she back there? 
 Calm down. Lower your voice. 
 Excuse me. Where is my sister? Her name is Simone. 
 She's 16. She swallowed a bunch of pills. 
 Yes. She is stable now. We have her admitted to the hospital tonight. 
 Okay, she's back there? 'Cause I need to go see right now. 
 One person allowed back there, and her mother is there with her right now. 
 What do you mean "her mother"? We don't got a mother.

 Hi. 
 (crying) 
 I saw Mama. 
 She was ready for me. 
 I almost didn't even want to come back. 
 Then why did you? 
 For you. 
 I came back for you. 
 She told me I had to take care of you. 
 Our mother was a junkie. 
 She was a junkie, Simone, and she died because of it, and you will, too, if you keep doing this. 
 You need to get it together. 
 I can't lose you like I lost her. 
 It took me too long to find you. 
 We can be like those real-life stories, you know? 
 The ones that inspire people. 
 We're gonna be on  Good Morning, America  when we're famous. 
 (crying) 
 Tell me about the contest. 
 Forget about the contest, Simone. 
 It's over. 
 Why? Because of me? 
 Stop it, Simone. 
 No. I'm not gonna stop it. That song's really dope. 
 You just OD'd, bitch. 
 I hate hospitals. 
 Put it back in. 
 You need to stop it. 
 No. 
 You can't leave. 
 Simone, stop. 
 What if they figure out who I am? 
 What if they figure out what we did? 
 You really don't think nobody's gonna come up in here looking for us? 
 How long you been sitting here? 
 A little while. 
 How is Simone? 
 Simone is good. 
 So why you look so sad, baby? 
 I've been thinking about Matthew 13. 
 These girls, Bobby. 
 These girls ain't got no roots. 
 They ain't got no religion. 
 I can't go back and undo all that. 
 Now, look at us. 
 We didn't have no roots either. 
 Somehow... we found our way. 
 Simone is one thing, but Star, I don't know. 
 Yeah, but they just got here. 
 Go easy, give 'em a minute. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I should get back to the hospital. 
 Damn, I hope she forgive me. 
 Danielle : Carlotta? 
 Y'all are ride or die. 
 You know that little crazy-eyed girl stole my candy. 
 Hello? 
 But she gonna be all right. 
 I'm looking for Star. 
 Oh, my God, bitch, there go Hunter Morgan. 
 Come here. 
 If y'all don't get into it: 35 touchdowns, 68% completion rate. 
 It's over for you. You turning it. 
 And since when you started watching football? 
 Since his fine ass became quarterback. 
 Please don't tell me you're messing with Star. 
 Not yet. 
 Ugh. 
 Girl won't return my phone calls. 
 Let me tell you something. 
 Star way too complicated for a man like you. 
 I see you with a more agreeable Asian-type girl. 
 (chuckles) 
 Star ain't here. 
 They at the hospital with her sister. 
 Which hospital? 
 Midtown General. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Star : Simone's ready to go. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Dr. Klein, the on-call psychiatrist. 
 You're a shrink? 
 She doesn't need a shrink. 
 She's a pothead, end of story. 
 It's, uh, it's more than pot. 
 We think this may have been a suicide attempt. 
 But it wasn't. 
 She feels great. 
 She hates it here and she'd like to leave, cool? 
 Just to be on the safe side, I'm ordering a 72-hour psych hold. 
 A psych hold? 
 Could you give us a moment, please? 
 Thank you. 
 What did you tell them? Because let me remind you, you are not our mother, you barely know us. 
 Well, I'm the closest thing she has to a mother right now. 
 I'm trying to do the best for her. 
 Since when? 
 You gave us up. 
 They used us for free government checks, free babysitting, free s*x. 
 That man is a doctor. 
 Do you know what's gonna happen if he finds out she's a minor and I'm not her legal guardian? 
 I'm tired of your speeches. 
 You were our mother's best friend. 
 You should have been there for us then. 
 Jahil :  Star. 
 Good news. I got you some studio time tonight at my friend Conny's. 
 Star : Tonight? 
 Uh, could we do it tomorrow maybe? 
 Demo's due tomorrow. 
 Wait, this don't even sound like you. 
 No, no, it's all good. 
 I just sound better during the day. 
 You're kidding me, right? 
 Look, Hurt Park Studios at 8:00. 
 I'll text you the address. An engineer will meet you. 
 Where are you gonna be? 
 I got some errands to run, then I'm gonna meet you there. 
 And look, Star, this guy's a buddy of mine. 
 All right? So no shenanigans. 
 I'm fresh out of shenanigans. 
 Good. 
 'Cause every minute in that studio's costing me plenty. 
 I got to go. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I heard your sister wasn't feeling well. 
 These are for her. 
 And how'd you find me? 
 I went by the salon and looked for you. 
 Most girls come when I call. 
 Well, A, I've been busy, clearly. 
 B, I'm not most girls, and C, you're gonna have to do a lot more than call to make me come. 
 (chuckles) 
 Why are you making this so difficult? 
 'Cause I'm not trying to be some WAG. 
 Well, maybe that's what I like about you. 
 So it's not my ass? 
 Let me take you out. 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe. 
 Thanks for the flowers. 
 Yeah. You're welcome. 
 Harris : Simone. 
 How you doing? 
 (exhales) 
 Is it true you tried to kill yourself? 
 No. 
 They're wrong about me. 
 I didn't try to kill myself. 
 I believe you. 
 You know that white light thing? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I think I believe it, 'cause... (sniffs) 
 'cause when I, I went to the other side, I... I think I saw my mom. 
 I... I believe in angels, but... 
 ...I don't know if I believe in God. 
 God saved my life just the way He saved yours. 
 When you hit rock bottom, that's when God shows up the most. 
 He showed up for you and kept you alive. 
 I just want you to talk to somebody. 
 Doesn't have to be me. 
 Just talk to somebody. 
 Alexandra :  I've been through this with my mom. 
 The whole codependent mess. 
 No one can make somebody get sober. 
 They have to want it. 
 And even if they do, sometimes it just doesn't work. 
 Maybe you should move back to New York. 
 Finish Julliard. 
 Go on a big world tour, meet all these new people. 
 I thought you wanted me to stay. 
 Then it's Julliard. 
 No, I do. 
 But them girls. 
 They gonna mess you up and turn you out. 
 Turn me out? (scoffs) 
 You don't think I can handle myself. 
 Listen. 
 I think you're beautiful. 
 I think you're brilliant. 
 I think you're talented, sexy. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I could go on. Want me to? 
 (laughs) 
 How do you know? 
 You haven't even heard me sing. 
 Every time I ask you, you turn me down. 
 What was I saying? 
 (laughs) That I'm sheltered. 
 There's nothing wrong with that. 
 I'm gonna make sure my kids are sheltered away from all this mess. 
 What mess? 
 I'm a black man in America. 
 I got to keep my head down, my mouth shut and my hands out of my pockets just so I can make it home alive. 
 
 
 
 (knocking on window) 
 Hey, Mahogany. 
 Get your ass out here, 911. 
 (groans softly) 
 Star :  Yeah, you got to see this place. 
 It's too much for Simone, man. She's climbing the walls. 
 We got to get her out. 
 I disagree. 
 You disagree? 
 Your sister needs help. Professional help. 
 My mother has been in rehab a dozen times. 
 Right. And clearly that didn't work. 
 All Simone needs is me. She's had a hard life already. 
 Her being in that place isn't gonna make it better... 
 It's gonna make it worse. 
 I'm busting her out. 
 All right, hold on. 
 There's guards, orderlies, and how are you gonna get her past Carlotta? 
 What are you about to do? 
 Hello? 
 I'll show you. 
 Alexandra : Whoa, whoa, whoa, yo, what are you doing? 
 (alarm wailing) 
 Are you crazy? 
 Come on! 
 You... 
 (alarm continues wailing) 
 Why'd you say that you were her mother? 
 She in the system. 
 If they find out I'm not her mother, they gonna call Social Services. 
 Or maybe you wish Simone was your real daughter. 
 Well, maybe I do. Maybe I can give her a normal life. 
 I'm your daughter. 
 I named you Arnold, after my father. 
 Mama, Arnold is dead. 
 And I'm not talking about Granddaddy. 
 I'm talking about this Arnold. 
 This Arnold is dead. 
 Gone. 
 I'm getting bottom surgery. 
 It ain't enough with the boobs and the hair and the makeup? 
 No, Mama. I need my outsides to match my insides. 
 Well, why would you pay somebody to mutilate what God gave you? 
 God gave me  me,  Mama. 
 And it's not mutilation. 
 I know a really good doctor. 
 He's expensive. 
 It costs $20,000, and I've saved up half already. 
 10 grand? 
 Now, I know you ain't make that money answering my phones. 
 We all do what we got to do, Mama.

 Turn it off. 
 Didn't you used to sing with Mixed Harmony? 
 That's none of your business. You see that girl right there? She's underage. 
 She OD'd on drugs last night. 
 She should be in a psych ward. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Why do you got to ruin every single thing I try to do? 
 Your sister almost died last night, and you're worried about your career? 
 My sister is fine. Simone, come in here. She's fine. 
 She wants to be here, and she wants to sing. You can go. 
 Carlotta : No, she doesn't. She wants to make you happy. 
 This has nothing to do with Simone. 
 This has to do with you and me. 
 I look like my mother, I sound like my mother, and it kills you, because... just like my mother... 
 I'm young and I'm sexy and I have more talent than you ever did. 
 Bitch, you ain't your mother. 
 I watched your mother die. 
 And I'm not about to watch it again. 
 Simone needs help. 
 I know what she needs. 
 Stop, okay? I said stop! 
 Stop talkin' 'bout me like I ain't even here. 
 If I want to smoke weed, I'll smoke weed. 
 And if I want to sing a damn song, I'll sing a damn song. 
 And if I want to kill myself, I will. 
 Yo. You know what? Too much drama. 
 I'm out. Good luck. 
 We out of here. Hey, man, tell your daddy I said hey. 
 Thanks, Big. 
 All right. Fo' sho. Be safe. 
 You happy? 
 Come on. I'm driving you back to the hospital. 
 No. No, no. Stop. 
 No, I don't want to go. I want to go home. 
 You can't. The hospital called looking for you. 
 If you not back there in a half an hour, they calling the cops. 
 Once they do that, I can't do anything to protect you. 
 You going back into the system. 
 (sighs) 
 What's the emergency? 
 I need you to do me a favor. 
 All right? It's gonna sound kind of strange, but... (sniffs) I need you to hit me in the face. 
 You know, bruise me up a little bit. 
 What, are you crazy? 
 Look, I'm-I'm in a jam, Hunter. 
 Okay? So just please hit me. 
 Come on. I need you to do this, all right? - No. 
 Hey, you know how much these hands are worth? 
 I got my team relying on me. 
 No, ask somebody else. 
 Hey. 
 I got no one else to ask, all right? 
 I got no one else. 
 You worried about your hands? 
 What? 
 This. Go ahead. Use this. 
 You're out of your mind. 
 Use it. 
 Use it. Come on. 
 Hunter, I'm in trouble! All right? 
 I'm in big trouble this time, all right? So, please, please, hit me. 
 (sniffs) Come on. 
 Hit me! 
 Do it! Hit me! 
 Do it, man, do it! 
 What the hell happened? 
 You guys set me up is what happened. 
 You told me this was a legit businessman. 
 He is. Bryan King. 
 He owns half the real estate in Atlanta. 
 Wait, what do you mean? 
 I thought this was a local pimp. 
 No, this is his side business. 
 That don't make no sense. That dude is rich. 
 Why would he mess with trafficking? 
 $500 a day per girl. 
 That's, what, $200K a year? 
 And that shipment that you lost, that's worth $2 million a year to him. 
 Look, man, all I know is I did exactly what you told me to do. 
 All right? I picked up those girls in that van and I'm headed to the drop. Next thing I know, some dude with a gun... He pulls up next to me, forces me over, kicks my ass and then he steals the van. 
 Where's the money, Jahil? 
 There ain't no money, man. I never made it to the drop. 
 That's what I'm trying to tell you. This dude, he had some mask on, so I don't know who he was. 
 I have no idea where he took those girls. 
 Yeah, well, Maggie's gonna be furious. 
 Yeah, unless she set me up. 
 Try to get those girls for free. 
 Damn, I'm so bored, man. 
 I want to get out of here. 
 Yeah, remember that the next time you want to take a fistful of pills. 
 I didn't do it on purpose. 
 That's what your mother would have said if she would have lived. 
 You know, your mother used to read to you when you were in her belly. 
 What would she read? 
 Poetry. 
 It used to help her write music. 
 Do you have any of that stuff, still? 
 Her poetry? 
 No. 
 I lost it. 
 Look... 
 I don't want you going down the way your mother did. 
 If that's where you're going, you need to get up out of my house and do it somewhere else. 
 It's not the path I'm going on. 
 It was a one-time thing, I swear. 
 Okay. 
 So, you ready to talk now? 
 I know you're a runaway. 
 And I know you got somebody in your head stirring up them nightmares. 
 So what was they doing in your last home? 
 Was it your foster mother? 
 No. 
 She just let him do whatever he wanted. 
 He beat her? 
 Sometimes. 
 He hit you? 
 No. 
 He was real nice to me. 
 He used to give me pot when she wasn't around. 
 And he would... 
 ...keep me from school... to have s*x with me. 
 You ain't tell your foster mother? 
 No, she knew. 
 And she liked it. 
 She liked it. 
 'Cause... the more he messed with me, the less he messed with her. 
 So you want to know why I get high? 
 That's why. 
 Because I can't... 
 Simone. 
 It's okay. It's okay, baby. 
 Let me tell you something. 
 That man... 
 ...he's never gonna hurt you again. 
 I swear to God. 
 How's your sister? 
 What happened to your face? 
 I got carjacked. 
 Stop it. 
 You're a bad liar. 
 Which is disturbing, 'cause you're our manager. 
 Part of being a good manager is being a good liar. 
 But you know what? You got a bigger problem. 
 I don't think you play to win, Jahil. 
 Win? 
 (chuckles) How am I supposed to win? 
 I can't even get to the starting line. 
 Look, let me ask you something, Star. 
 Why do you want me to manage you? 
 Because you'd knock over your mother to get to the top. 
 And some people might think that's gross, but I like it. 
 It's okay. 
 Then why don't you trust me? 
 I do. 
 As much as I trust anybody. 
 Then why didn't you come to me about Simone? 
 Did it ever cross your mind that, as your manager and hers, that I might be able to help? 
 No, not really, unless you have some sort of medical degree that I'm not aware of. 
 And besides that, I know exactly how you feel about her. 
 Look, Star, she's a mess. 
 Anyone can see that. But she needs help. 
 Real help that you can't give her. 
 That's my personal opinion. But as your manager, she's an anchor around our neck. 
 She's weighing us down. 
 I got big dreams for you, Star. 
 Not those other girls, for you. 
 Did it ever cross your mind that maybe this isn't a life that your sister wants and this is her way out? 
 Cut her loose. 
 You'll both be happier. 
 No. No. 
 I'm gonna keep telling you no. 
 I'm not going to drop my sister. 
 Wherever I go, she's gonna go. Whatever I do, she's gonna do. 
 And whatever plans you have, they better include her. 
 And Alexandra. And if you don't get that, then you don't get me. 
 All right, well... we missed the deadline for the festival. 
 Better figure out what comes next. 
 There you go again, Jahil, with that not playing to win. 
 We didn't miss the deadline. 
 We've got two hours. 
 (short chuckle) 
 You should be in the loony bin. 
 (laughs) 
 That's a good idea. 
 It is? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's bring the mountain to Muhammad. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Babe. 
 Let's go take a walk. 
 We're coming right back.
