 Last time y'all saw  Star... 
 Jahil :  There's a big music festival coming here to Atlanta, and the deadline is in two days. 
 Turn it off. 
 Didn't you used to sing with Mixed Harmony? 
 That's none of your business. 
 This has to do with you and me. 
 I look like my mother. I sound like my mother. 
 And I have more talent than you ever did. 
 Bitch, you ain't your mother. 
 I just don't want those girls to go through what I went through. 
 I bet everything I had on you dumb bitches, and you blew it. Mary with the drugs, and you, gaining all that weight, never showing up on time. 
 This is Eva. She's my niece. 
 Hola. 
 Carlotta :  Simone's foster father is here. 
 He'd been raping that girl for years. 
 That's why they ran away. Let's go handle business. Simone :  I didn't kill Otis. Star :  Well, if Simone didn't kill him,  then who did? Carlotta :  God. Sometimes I get all up in my head. I start thinking bad things, and then bad things happen. I think all secrets are best buried. Help me get these girls through this murder, and forgive me for the sins I commit along the way. I know you looking after them, 'cause it's clear I can't stop this girl group thing from happening. ♪ ♪ Photographer : Good. All right. You ladies can take a break. I just got to adjust the lights for a sec. You guys look great. Great. But, listen, we got to stick around and rehearse. "Rehearse"? After this? Yeah. Oh, no, I'm good. I'm going home. We know that number. You girls got no idea what you're up against, do you? The talent pool in Atlanta is a beast. Y'all got four days till the live auditions. You better be the baddest chicks out there. Photographer : All right, ladies, I'm all set. Let's go. Hey, listen, can we wrap this up soon, I mean, if you can? Photographer : Yeah, don't worry about it, just a few more. All right. Good. Yeah, that looks good. Yeah, it looks better. It looks better. All right. Can you switch for me? I got this. No, the-the other way. Switch? Photographer : Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Can we get some more powder on this one over here? Yeah, that's like the third time you've put makeup on me. It's just a lighting issue, sweetheart. No, more like a color issue, sweetheart. I don't see you powdering their faces every 15 minutes. (soft chuckle) You know what? It's all good. We got what we needed. What is your problem? Jahil : I'm really sorry. You don't see this? This hack that calls himself a photographer is trying to lighten me up to blend with you two. Oh my God, dude, you're being sensitive. I'm being sensitive. He was practically salivating taking photos of you. Yeah, I have that affect on people. It's not new. It's not cute. (scoffs) I'm going back to the salon. You know she's right. Alexandra :  I really don't get why you won't at least let me try. Girl, you... (sighs) you crazy. I am not letting you dye my hair. I'm guinea pig enough just letting you wash it. ♪ ♪ What y'all fighting about now? Joan Smalls is mad because she didn't get pampered enough yesterday at the photo shoot. What happened? A photographer was too focused on the two Lite-Brites instead of taking the actual photo. Some things never change. Look, now is not the time to get into a catfight, ladies. A man was murdered last week, and somebody did it. It was probably her. You walk around here like you're some out of place victim. You've probably got a shank in that Chanel lipstick case. Alexandra : You stabbed a man once already and left him for dead. Yeah, I did. Carlotta : I said, knock it off. Of course you're proud of it. (phone dings) Damn. Jahil won't let up. He keeps calling about the song. Somebody needs to get you in line. He got rid of that body for us. Yeah, so after what he just did, if he tells you to jump, you need to be asking how high. Simone, go get me some conditioner out of the garage. It's in that box next to the old water heater. (dog barking in distance) (indistinct conversations nearby) (sighs) Oh, my God, it's my mother. Carlotta : Simone, hurry up! We'll be late. I'm coming. Man : It's all you on this take, Mary. Mary : ♪ Driving by the park tonight ♪

♪ ♪ Carlotta : Simone, come on. We can't be late on your first day. I ain't got time for your activating, boy. Come on, Miss C. Can I get in my good morning? Hey, Simone. Hey. Good morning, now keep walking. I got enough of them damn fliers in the salon already. People got to stay woke. No disrespect, Miss C, but don't turn a blind eye. You see they killing us out here, and it's real. My mother got her teeth knocked out so that you could vote. Don't tell me about turning no blind eye. I'm woke. But I got to live life, too. I'll put some up at school. Really? Well, you can take these. Yeah. Got to stay woke. Carlotta : Simone, walk. You don't have to be nervous about what happened. He's dead. I saw a video. "A video"? Of my mother singing. What was you doing digging through my stuff? I-I saw it next to the conditioner. Well... that was a long time ago. Mary : Carlotta, if we do this right, I think this song could get us back on track. It better. We don't got a lot of options left. Hey. (laughs) I waited up for you last night, Jahil. (door closes) Oh, I'm sorry, babe. I had some business I had to take care of. Wait till you see what I got planned for y'all. Hey, you know what? On this take, let's try it with just Mary. What do you mean, try it with just Mary? Just this take. You know, the producer thinks she has an interesting vibe. Is this coming from the producers or is this coming from you? Really, babe? You and I started this thing. Come here. I swear, it's all good. Hey, Cotton. Hey. How you doing, beautiful? Where the girls at? They in the back. Hey, but you know you can't go back there. What? (scoffs) Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh. You need to turn around and walk right back out that door. Oh, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Who is she? This is my niece. You know Carlotta don't want you here when she not around. Alexandra : What's up? I thought we weren't rehearsing till Simone got out of school. (speaking Spanish) What's she saying? She likes our singing. Oh, this ain't about rehearsal. Look, I want to get you all to Sadie's, 'cause there's a couple of acts that are competing in the live auditions that are gonna be there tonight. What's happening tonight? Who is she? His niece. His niece. Jahil's taking us to a club tonight to check out the competition, so we're about to go get ready. Simone isn't going anywhere, it's a school night. Bad day. Hey, Lottie, check this out. You know, since I been pulling the girls away from the salon, I thought maybe I'd bring someone in, help you out. Your niece? Yeah. I mean, the girls told me that you need help around here, and Eva used to do hair in the Dominican Republic, so maybe she could help you out while we rehearse. I'm not running a school for wayward girls here. Hey, look, those girls, they need to put in the work to make it to the next round, so... She could sweep floors, but Simone stays.

I wouldn't want to have to follow after us, either, so... Don't push it, sweetheart. We're just saving up for Atlanta NextFest. Cute. But to win Atlanta NextFest, you got to get through us, so... Who sings the national anthem at a club? That's all I'm trying to figure out. Don't worry about it. They got faces for radio. Ugh. And they got a blonde one! Okay. We need to change up our song. You think? I'm just saying. These girls have 200,000 Instagram and Twitter followers. We don't even have a name. I could have Simone set up some accounts. Well, you think she's up for it? Yeah. Now that we got rid of her foster dad, she should be able to do something. Look, let's just figure out a song, all right? Did you kill him? You could tell me. How could I kill that big-ass man? I don't know. I tried, too. Whatever song we do at these auditions, we have to kill it. Well, we'll look good if you let Cotton do her job and stop being mean. That bitch can do with $20 what you can't do with your credit cards. And what she can't buy, she'll steal. She can give us a look. All right. Well, these live auditions are in two days. That's cutting it close. Dude, we made our demo in a loony bin. We could do anything, girl. (laughs) Well, you know, sister Jenkins just had a stroke. Mm. I need you to step in as the choir director. You're-you're here all time, and, you know, I'll get to see you more often. I think it'll be beautiful. You trying to have everybody talking. They already talking, baby. It's what they do. No, I-I got so much going on right now with Simone and them girls and the salon. What's going on? Nothing, Bobby. I'm fine just being part of the choir. I just got too much on my plate right now. Well, I'm-a pray on it. ♪ Next time your heart beats I hope it breaks your chest ♪ (music turns off) Well? Star : That's not it. We sang "Break Your Chest" once and got booed off the stage. I'm not trying to do that again. All right, you think you can do better, let's hear it. I've got a song. You don't have to get personal about it. We can work on it together. I've got a song. I'm just saying all I've been hearing are complaints and no suggestions. Maybe if you stopped texting Hunter, we could focus on what we need to do. Okay, maybe if y'all shut up for a little bit and listen to me, you would've heard me when I said I got a song. All right, let's hear it. I honestly didn't even know you were there. Yeah, of course you didn't. Is that a VCR player? Just watch. Mary : ♪ Haunted by the picture frames ♪

You just don't speak it that well. Is that why you came here to America, for a job? Um,  mi mamá,  um... she came here 15 years ago. (mutters in Spanish) What is she talking about? That was the last time she ever saw her. Cool, looks great. You done? Sí. Good luck finding your mama. Star, you're so damn rude. I gave her a tip. Please. Did I do some something wrong? No, that's just Star. We're not doing it. Stop, yo. You better be at rehearsal at 7:00. We got so much work to do for these live auditions still. Oh, yeah, some girl group named Glamour's pretty good, right? Yeah. Glamour. How do you know that? Jahil. He's all psyched up about you. How do you feel about him? Got him on a leash. But if we have any chance at all, we can't be walking in there looking like  American Idol  rejects. He has to get it right on the money flow for real. We got to have enough for Cotton to work with to make us look good. It's not even all that. All that's extra. I just want to sing. That's how I feel about football. You know, I loved it 'cause it got me out of the house. At least you had a house. And a family. My dad's in jail. Last time I saw him, I was 12. He used me as a shield in a shootout. Damn. Nah, wasn't that bad. Must be why you're so tight with your mom. You got it? Yeah, I got it. What, you think you're gonna pay for this? Hey... Take this. You sure you want to give me your credit card? Can I trust you? Absolutely. And tell Cotton to buy you something so that you can murder in those auditions. ♪ ♪ 
 
 Hey, man, it's me. Just checking in to see if you had a minute to check out that demo. Hit me back. Where's Star? Out with Hunter. She knows we only got this place for a couple hours, right? Yeah, we can do it without her, though. Just fill her in later. We can't do it without her. She's the lead. Since when? Since we need to bring something fresh, all right? To get over on these other girls. Someone like Star singing R&B gives us an edge. You mean because she's white. What, you think I'm stupid? I didn't choose her because she was white. I chose her because of her voice. Yeah, and that was a smart decision. Now make another one. Let Star sing the lead on this, and you're guaranteed to win. Why isn't she picking up her phone? Did you guys do something to piss her off or something? (scoffs) You're ridiculous. She got bent out of shape over a tape Simone found. What tape? It was a video of my mother singing. What was the song? Something about unloving... I don't know. It sounded personal, but it was fire. I think we should sing it for live auditions. Why did my mom and Miss Carlotta stop singing? (exhales) It was a lot of things. Ask Carlotta. Well, I'm asking you. You were their manager. Now you're managing us. What did you do to make the group fall apart? I didn't do a damn thing, all right? I handled my business. I had them all lined up for a European tour. Everything was cool, and then... And then what? Carlotta got jealous of Mary. All right? Jealous of your mom. She screwed it up, not me. Let's get that process on the fly, okay? I'm gonna try this number. (line ringing) Woman : Hello? Mrs. Leecan?

Unless you stole it. You stole it, didn't you? You stole his credit card? No, actually, I didn't. Why do you always think the worst of me? (scoffs) Wow. You make Madonna look like Cinderella, don't you? He said we could get whatever we needed for the live auditions. I'm gonna go tell Cotton. (TV playing indistinctly in background) (door opens) (door closes) Who them flowers for? Oh, they for you, C. Special delivery. That's nice. Who are they from? Pastor Harris. So? He can't...? Why he can get me flowers? We ain't no secret. Hate to break the news to you, but you sort of are. I mean, just 'cause we know... Miss Bruce : Chatter don't mean them old biddies down there at that church don't know. I can't stand them. They so nosy. That's why I don't fool with that place. You know Pastor Harris asked me to direct the choir. I told him I'll think about it, but he ain't gonna take no for an answer. Look, all I'm saying is we need to pay homage to the girl groups of the '90s and give it that fresh flavor. That's hot, that's different, that's our signature piece. I know you ain't boosting again. Like you even care. This is Hunter's card. He said we could pick up some stuff for the live auditions. I might've gone a little crazy. That conversation we were having ain't hardly done. Right. We need to agree on a song that we can compete with. I'm not singing my mother's song. It's the one. It's dope in all the right places. Get over the issues with your mother. I know it's easier said than done, but just do it. I hate her, Alex. I hate how she left us, and I'm not trying to sing one of her songs. Quit pushing me. You okay? Why does everything have to be a fight with her? 'Cause that's all she's ever known. She don't know how to do nothing else. Well, if we're ever gonna make it as a group, she needs to get it together. That's why there ain't no girl groups. It's always one. So, who came up with the group name, Mixed Harmony? You or Mary? Jahil. (scoffs) At rehearsal other day, he was telling us how you got jealous of Mary and that's why the group ended. I don't believe a word he says ever, but... is it true? Jahil is a lying, coke-snorting pig. His obsession with Mary is what ended us. Next time, ask him to tell you the truth. Mary : ♪ Baby, I've tried ♪

Why am I always the one who has to apologize? Because you the one always startin' mess. How do y'all expect to make it if there's nothing you can agree on? Go ask her. She's the one being precious about a song. Then work with her. There's gonna be plenty of other things out there trying to tear y'all apart. She gave up a lot to do this with you. What you give up? Where you going? I was just gonna check out the outfits. You finish your homework? (sighs) Half of it. Okay, well, march yourself back down there and finish the other half. Are you still bent up about the tape? Look, if this music thing don't work out, you need something to fall back on. Why don't you come to the auditions tomorrow? See what you're fighting for?
