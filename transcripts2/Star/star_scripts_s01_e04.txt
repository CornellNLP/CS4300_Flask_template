 Okay, so this is what happened before on  Star. 
 There's a big music festival coming here to Atlanta,  the perfect venue to introduce you to the world. 
 You got to submit a demo, and the deadline is in two days. You don't think people will see us? That's the point, Simone. So, you really don't think people aren't gonna be looking for us. Star! Stop it! You killed him! I'm looking for Star. They at the hospital with her sister. Most girls come when I call. You're going to have to do a lot more than call to make me come. I didn't sign up for trafficking women. (speaking Spanish) Maggie's gonna be furious. ♪ And I don't need no man to make me happy ♪ 
♪ I really want you, but I don't need no man. ♪ Where's my daughter? Carlotta :  I guess it's onward and upward, but it ain't that easy. Not when the devil catches up to your ass. Rickey Smiley : All right, y'all.  Rickey Smiley Morning Show. Hey. Listen for your chance to win tickets to the already sold out Taylor Brothers Hair Show, the wildest hair battle in the ATL. Cotton : God's Blessings. More  Rickey Smiley Morning Show  coming up next. Y'all heard that? Baby, we in there this year. We winning. And don't be late. Them Scissor Siblings, baby, they don't even know what I'm gonna to do to them. You said that last year and lost. (laughs) Doris, I'm-a need you to worry about paying for your hair on time, something you never do. Yeah. But you did say that last year. Oh, no, I'm serious this year, baby. Watch. They don't know how I'm getting ready to slay them. Where's Danielle? She went to ask her aunt for a favor. You know, the girls are performing a Gladys Knight remix at the hair show. Here we go with this Gladys Knight stuff again. I can't... Y'all know damn good and well that girl ain't no kin to Gladys Knight. She been saying that same lie for years. Why do you always have something to say? Why we ain't never met her? Carlotta : Well, why everybody got to be a liar, Bruce? And at this point, anything will help. Gladys Knight? Uh-huh. Did I ever tell you I was six months pregnant by Tyler Perry? Shut up, Bruce. Sorry about that. Where were we? Man : Uh, don't mind me. Beautiful girls you got here, Carlotta. Are the black kids yours? Carlotta (in distance) : No, they ain't mine. Might as well be, though. (man laughs) Man : Y'all are funny. And I ain't talking about those sweet boys you got here. All right, you've been straight up with me. So I'm gonna be straight up with you. Why you want to work here? Well, the shop is missing one thing. Carlotta : What? Otis : Men. ♪ ♪ You missing men. And I ain't talking about them little sweet boys you got running around here. Hold on, don't get it twisted, sweetie. I'm more of a man than you will ever be and more of a woman than you will ever get. Carlotta, you better get Sheba out of here. Oh, no. Come on. Don't get it wrong. Ain't nothing wrong with a little sugar in your tank, baby. Otis : Women ain't the only ones that want to look good. I'm just laying out facts. Think about it. Man comes in, gets a haircut. He leaves looking all smooth, feeling good, goes home. His lady's gonna ask him where he got his hair cut. Next thing you know, they're both calling here booking appointments. Simone : Get up, he's here. Get up, he's here. No. Who? Otis. What? Oh, no, it's too... It's... Mm-mm. It's too early for this. No, I heard him talking to Miss Carlotta. What if he's telling her that you tried to kill him? Okay. What you heard is that medication they got you on. Girl, wake up. You know it have side effects. I know what them doctors said. If you don't quit touching me... You know what? I swear to God. He better be down there or I'm-a kill you, too. I swear he's down there. I know what I heard. I'm not playing with you today. Um, Miss Carlotta, was there a man down here a minute ago? Well, good morning to you, too. Yeah. He was applying for a job. A man, though, right? Yeah. Why you want to know? Stay out my business. You sounding more like Star. Some people actually want to work. I actually want to go to bed. While you up, I need these cleaned, separated and labeled. Miss Carlotta, it's the crack of dawn. If you want to win the hair show this year, don't you think your main attraction should get some sleep? Lazy. Hey, Ma, they have been rehearsing all night. Thank you, Kai. All right. Go on back to bed, but don't think you getting out of working that booth. We know. Star, I swear it was him. You got to stop doing this. You're driving yourself crazy, Simone. You won't sleep. You won't let nobody else sleep now. You got to let this go. Otis isn't alive, 'cause he's dead, 'cause I killed him. Please try to remember that. Hey, Miss Ruby. What's going on? Hey, little girl. Go ask Bruce to get me a blunt. Grandma, go inside. I won't. Go ask Bruce. And you take your ass to work. She right. Let me get to work. So, you're gonna be at work all day? Why? You got a better offer? I just might. You know about the hair show, right? Yeah, we know about it. What you know about the hair show? Grandma, please! I know about that damn hair show every year, 'cause every year Carlotta and Bruce lose to the Scissor Siblings. Wait, they got y'all going? Performing. Bruce is styling and we're singing Gladys Knight. So, God's Blessing actually may bring home the trophy this year, then. I don't know. It's the full-on retro sound and look, crazy wigs and all. You should see Star. She looks like a blonde mushroom. (laughs) So, you finally invite me to hear you sing. Yeah. Too bad you're gonna be at work. Mmm. Well, I wonder if there's anything I wouldn't do for you. We're on at 3:00 sharp. I'll see what I can do. Can I come? No. Ugh. Girlie, go tell Bruce to bring me a hit.

"Congratulations, you've been selected for the next round of the Atlanta NextFest at the Honda Stage Competition." (laughter) (screams) All right, look. I just spoke with the reps. Now they want to see a video of you all doing a live performance. That means we got a new deadline, two weeks. Okay, well Derek's having a Black Lives Matter event. Maybe we can do it then. Nah, I don't want to do political. Why don't we sing at Miss Carlotta's church benefit? You're so cute, you little nut job. No, that's not sexy enough. We need these stiffs to stand up. What about the hair show we're performing at tonight? We're already doing it, and the judges at Atlanta NextFest would never expect us to do a Gladys Knight song. You know, that's retro. Shows your history, shows your taste. I like it. Bow down to Gladys. Well, you know what? That's... That's why I love you. Come here. That is a great idea. I mean, there's gonna be, like, hundreds of people there, right? Thousands. All right. Hair show it is. Well, come on. (claps hands) Show me what you got. Let's go. We did it! (laughter) ♪ Oh ♪

We'll be more than happy to take you, okay? Your hair is beautiful, by the way. Miss Bruce : That's right, baby, we got wigs, closures, weaves, anything you need, baby. And I want to give you one of these because I think this would be a great texture for you. Mm, mm, mm. Ugh. What is this? Just tired. The ugly sisters. Y'all got five seconds to get y'all peculiar ass from my booth. Let it go. It ain't worth it. Oh, really? That ain't what Yelp said. Mm. One. What was it the review said? Oh, let me find out. Two. Scissor Siblings ranked best beauty salon in Atlanta. Three. Or was it the best beauty salon period? Four. Mm-hmm, look, do you remember how many stars we got? Let's count them up. Five. Five. Five. Enough. Save it for the stage. We already did that. Y'all ain't make no noise. Oh, honey, we left that stage in awe, though. You gonna have to do a whole lot more than them little synthetic dresses, baby. You left 'em in "Aw, hell nah." And you're too young to have your hair like that anyway. (audience cheering and applauding) S'up, Hunter? Surprised to see you here. Oh, I'm just here being a supportive boyfriend. Boyfriend? Yeah. Who's this? Jahil : This is Eva. Hunter : Eva? Never seen her around before. She your latest addition to Magic City? Actually, she's my niece. My brother sent her to stay with me for a little while. Where are the girls? Uh, in the back getting ready. All right, look, do me a favor. Keep an eye on her for a minute. Thanks. And listen, keep your hands to yourself. You're not from around here, are you? Hola. Step close because up next on the main stage, another live performance from one of Atlanta's hottest new salons. Don't you miss it. Cotton : Girl, is she gonna be okay? Simone? Yes. She's gonna be fine. She don't have a choice. Look, you can't make her do something if she's not ready. You and I can handle it. Right, and she did just get out the hospital. What if she's tired? Alexandra : Thank you. We started this together. We're gonna finish this together. Girl, look at her. You gonna do something to get ready? (laughs) Star : You know what? So obnoxious, yo. Ladies, I have someone who would like to wish you good luck. I want you to meet my Aunt Gladys. (Gladys laughs) How you guys doing? How are you? Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Oh, my God, hi. Hi. My mother loved you. Oh, thank you so much. Hi. Ms. Knight, I know you probably won't remember me, but... Roland's daughter. Yeah. (laughs) Of course I remember you. Wow. When you did the piano duet with Alicia Keys. Oh, my God, I was so nervous. (laughs) You were brilliant. (chuckles) And your dad? He's in New York right now. So, what are you doing here? Well, you told me to chase my dreams, so here I am. You've done something brave. Believing in yourself is half the battle, and if nothing else happens, you've already won. Miss Bruce : Oh, my God, really? Come on, man. I need y'all to focus. Cotton, why you in the mirror? Miss Bruce. (laughing): Hey. Danielle : My Aunt Gladys. Well, I'll be damned. (laughs) Hey, you guys, I'm gonna let you go, okay. I know you got to get ready. I'll be out there watching. Okay. (laughs) Let's get our seats before we lose them. Let's get our seats. Ms. Knight, before you go... Yes? ...I'd like to ask you a huge favor.

Go. ...Yolanda's Nappy Kitchen. (applause) Where we going? Back to Carlotta's. Why? We just killed our performance. We just need to go, okay? Star :  I need your help. He's here. Yes. (door closes) Hey, little mama. How you doing? (phone clatters on floor) Where are we going? Alex, hello? Hello? Otis is here, Simone. Otis :  Now, I'm not leaving without my daughter. Simone is not your daughter, and she's not going anywhere with you. Listen, girl, you do not want me to go to the police. 'Cause if I do, I'm gonna make sure your little white ass is living up under the jail. Alexandra :  Your sister saw him. He was in the audience. He saw us performing. Where is she? She went to go look for him, but it's okay. No. Let go of me. Simone... I have to take you back to Carlotta's. No, I... Just, please let's go, Simone. Alex? Star :  Call them. And while you're at it, tell them how you raped Simone. How I saw you. (grunts) I like that. Yeah, baby doll. See, you, you stabbed me. Tried to kill me. Thought you did. See, what you're gonna do is you're gonna bring her to me or I'm gonna call the cops. I got to go. Where you going? Otis :  And that will be kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder  and stealing my damn car. (laughs) Who does that? Hey, hey, hey. You can't just leave me here by myself, Cotton. You looking at a long time, you little whore. (spits) Oh. (spits) Mm. (yells) I'm going to be waiting on P3, parked across from the exit in a silver car. You got 15 minutes. 15 minutes, baby. Hmm? There's always room for one more if you want to join us. I'd love to have you. (loud pounds on door) Hey, Miss Carlotta. You looking good today. (crying) What happened? Did he hurt you? I've got it under control. What'd he do to you? Simone was right. That man was in my house this morning. Who is he? That's Otis, her foster father. He came back for her. Where's Simone? She's with Alexandra. Okay, I'm calling the cops. No, no, no, no, no. Carlotta, you can't. You-You can't. We can't... We can't call the cops. Okay. You need to tell me what happened. You need to tell me everything. When I finally found Simone, he was on top of her, raping her. So I stabbed him, and I kept stabbing him and I tried to kill him. So, if you call the cops, Simone's going back and I'm going to jail. That's the whole story. I won't let that happen. And I damn sure ain't letting him get away with this. Go home. I'll handle it. I need you to come up and meet me on the second floor now. Where's my gun? (elevator bell dings) (softly): Bitch. (chomping gum) You did a really good job up there.

You're not happy to see me? Not even just a little bit? Huh? Oh. You know you're still daddy's little girl. Put the gun down. I ain't going anywhere with you. You hurt me! All right.

(applause) Emcee : Please give a round of applause for Keena 360. She's paved the way for so... ...for so many artists that you see here today. What happened to you? Simone. Where is she? She ran off. We need to find her. She needs us. I've looked for that girl everywhere. She's not here. Did you call her? Yeah, a million times. Keeps going straight to voice mail. Yeah. I knew this would happen. I knew she would do something like this. I've been trying to protect her. We're gonna find her, all right? We need to, fast, because she's crazy. And we got to find her before she does something crazy. Which one of you has my gun? What are you talking about? My gun is missing. Simone. What about Otis? Otis is dead. Star : He's dead.

We both know what'll happen if she's left alone. (crying) (applause in distance) Otis. Call the girls and tell them we got her. Hello. It's me. We found her. Carlotta wants y'all to come back. (sighs) Boy, you done been through more in your 16 years than most people have in their lifetime. But listen to me. (sniffles) That chapter of your life is over. You understand? Could we have a minute? Simone, let me tell you something. The smell of his cologne, the sound of his voice, the feeling... of his nasty hands on your body... Those memories are going to fade. Okay? They will fade. But you need to find something to focus on. That's how that works. All right? Now, I know you don't care about all of this. But look at where we are. Look at how far we've come. Hold onto that, okay? I can. Okay. Emcee :  And now,  the moment we've all been waiting for, first place winner of this year's Taylor Brothers Hair Show goes to... (drumroll playing) God's Blessings Beauty Salon! (audience cheering) Emcee : Yes! Get it, girl! There's an encore performance coming up. God's Blessings won. Let's go. Come on. We're gonna be strong. These are done for. I've been meaning to fix 'em. Yeah, we will. Come on. (audience cheering) Yes! Congratulations. Bitches. Emcee : Get it, girl. There's a lot of people out there, there's cameras everywhere. Y'all need to get up on that stage. It's called an alibi. And we don't talk about this. You understand? Emcee : And we have something coming up for you. Not ever. We have another surprise, an encore performance. Now... sparkle, Neely, sparkle.

There were four other exchanges that night, and every single one of them went off without a hitch. To be honest, I think he's lying. I'll keep an eye on him. If Jahil's up to something, it's only a matter of time before he slips up. So what are we supposed to do? Hmm? Just act like nothing ever happened? That's exactly what you gonna do. You girls been looking over your shoulders since you got here. It's over now. I don't know about y'all, but it's been a long day. I'm going to bed. Yeah, me, too. Simone : I didn't do it. I didn't kill Otis. What? Simone... Star : That's enough. We know what happened. Star, like, ease up off her. You saw her, she had Carlotta's gun. I wanted to kill him. I just couldn't pull the trigger. I'm so confused. Simone, we're the last people you need to lie to. We will protect you. I didn't kill Otis! I don't think I believe you. I didn't! Star : All right, okay. Well, if Simone didn't kill him, then who did? Carlotta :  Sometimes it all comes down to what you don't say. That night, we all agreed: the devil is gone... for now.
