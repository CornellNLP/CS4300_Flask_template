 Previously on  Star... 
 I met this girl on Instagram. 
 She grew up in foster care, and everything she's been through is in her voice. 
 I need to make music that feeds my soul. 
 And my music don't. 
 You want what? 
 Simone's address. 
 You're no better than anybody else in this house. 
 I never said I was. 
 You're not getting any information on a child  in the system, even if she was your sister. 
 Simone : You killed him! 
 What if they come looking for us? 
 They won't. 
 We're gonna stop in Atlanta. 
 There's this lady named Miss Carlotta. 
 She's our godmother. The music we're making... It's my new life. Your parents cool with that? My mom's dead. I'm Derek. I live next door to Miss Carlotta. I know where to find a manager. Girl, I'm gonna have to take you on. That's Mary's kid. Who? Star. Stay away from those girls. Carlotta :  I promised their mother I'd take care of them. They got no idea to ride with the devil they're about to get on. (music over computer) We killed this. ♪ Who shot ya? ♪ Simone, pass that. We did so dope, though. See, I put my balls on the line for you. I took a big chance. So now you all better start listening to me, 'cause I'm gonna manage you. You booked us at a house party, Jahil. It's not you got us meetings with record execs. Simone : Damn, Alexandra. Cold-blooded. Please let the man talk. Oh, I will. No, no. It's cool. She's just running me through my paces. I can respect that. There's a big music festival coming here to Atlanta, and it's got a Honda Stage, and it's the perfect venue for me to introduce you to the world. So book us. There's steps to this thing. There's a radio contest, an EPK. You got to submit a demo, and the deadline is in two days. You ready for that, little girl? Yes. The question is, do you have enough money? Or better yet, do you even know how expensive they are? Oh, I know how much they cost. I already booked a studio. Why don't you just worry about the music? Faith, Miss Atheist. Faith. Chile, bye. Look, I'm about to go see Derek. Who's Derek? None of your business. Look, if you manage us, show me the money. Star : Please don't be late to the salon. I really don't want to hear her mouth today. You ready to go? Let's go. I want to finish my chicken. You can bring it, babe. Bring mine, too. ♪ She's a bad thang ♪

Well, my mom's dead, too. ♪ Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane... ♪ She died when I was seven. I'm sorry. It's fine now. Let's just say we got something in common. ♪ Caroline, don't you see... ♪ Well, my dad was my hero. He was a cop. He was shot in the line of duty when I was 12. I was raised to respect cops, that they were here to protect us. ♪ Mighty fine... ♪ What's the matter? What's the matter? (knocking on door) Woman : Who is it? Who is that? It's...

Go away, Grandma, nobody! I hear voices. Got that girl in that room. Think I don't know what's going on. You're gonna make me fall in love with you, girl. Oh, really? Oh, really?

♪ B-b-bad, b-b-bad, b-b-bad. ♪ (indistinct chatter) Cotton : Girl, I got a feeling y'all gonna win this contest, and when you do, you're gonna be wearing my clothes. No thanks, RuPaul. You got one more time to call me RuPaul. Look at the little sneak freak. I seen you come out that boy's house, walking funny. Nasty. How are y'all getting in this contest? We got to get a demo. What is this, some more of Jahil's mess? Jahil got us that gig at his godson's house, and it went bananas. I really think y'all should work out whatever it is you need to work out. Stay out of my business, and get back to work. Carlotta. Star? Star, I... What's up? I've been thinking about this contest and... you don't think people will see us? That's the point, Simone. Okay, you really don't think that nobody's coming looking for us? Excuse me, I'll rinse it in a second. I told you to stop talking like this. Okay, I keep getting these nightmares about him coming for us. I killed him, he's dead, and he's not coming for us. Okay, I can feel it. I get it, but if you keep talking like this, you're gonna get us in trouble. (heavy sniffing) (yells) (knock on door) Look, I'm in the middle of something. Can we do this later? Now is good. ♪ ♪ I tell you to stay away from Mary's kids, and you take them to that punk-ass godson of yours. That punk is worth 20 million a year. He can help with their career. Why are you doing this again? Because I got a gut feeling about this, Lottie. Oh, yeah? Where did your gut feeling get me and Mary? They need a manager like me. Stop. You stop. You had those girls, and you lost them. They know that? They know why you lost them? Let them choose, Carlotta. Let  them  choose. And Star, she's just like Mary, you know? Ain't nothing gonna stop her. Not unless you get her hooked on drugs, like you did Mary. That's a lie. I'll tell them, Jahil. I'll tell them exactly what you did to Mary. (snoring) Bruce : I'm so sick of Miss Cotton, girl. Cotton, let me tell you something, little girl. You're gonna stop screwing up people's schedules around here. Especially mine, girl. I don't play about my coins. You do your job and let me do mine. Star, come here, baby. Let me holler at you for a second. I'm not about to sit here and argue with your ugly ass. I know that. You can't, 'cause you're not smart. You need to go brush that synthetic wig. ("Groove Is in the Heart" playing) Oh, my God.  This  is my song. How this your song, Alex, girl? You too young for this, honey. I used to dance to this when I was little. Thank you.

(phone ringing) (phone continues ringing) (camera shutter sound) So, your dad is one of the biggest stars on the planet and you just didn't feel like talking about it? Why would you lie about that? To keep from having conversations like this one. You poor thing. So, how rich are you, then? (scoffs) So, that's the white girl. (scoffs) I mean, you are white. (laughing) Pack your stuff. Really? Dad, I'm 19. And still using my credit cards. I'm supporting you. Contacting my friends, trying to find out if some local manager is worth repping you. How do you think that makes me look? As always, it's about you. Star : You were checking up on Jahil? Alexandra : Yeah, and? Ain't nobody trying to listen to you. Rose : I go away for two weeks and you pull this one. You're drinking again. Well, what do you think? You had me scared, disappearing like this. Look, I came to Atlanta to work on my music. You didn't even tell Mariesol. That better not be a maid. Oh, damn it is. (chuckles) You have bad roots, you insolent hussy. What we got going here? Girl, watch out, 'cause it's messy. Alexandra : I already said I'm wasn't going. I'm not about to talk about this anymore, Mom. Darling, please. I'm Carlotta. I own this salon. This... is my mother. We're here to take her home. Do you always take in little girls to you house? Mom, she's been good to me, okay? We're staying at The W until tonight. Don't let that plane leave without you. Oh, it will. And I'll be just fine. All right, what? I mean, you want to talk about your music? What? We did. You know we did. And you said exactly what you had to say. Be on that plane. Come to your senses, darling, please. (screen slams shut) Okay, Alexandra. (screen slams shut) Explain. What do I need to explain? Look at them. He just asked you to talk about your music. He doesn't care about my music. Are you thinking about all of us? Star. Where are you going? If you won't to talk to him, I will. Miss Carlotta : Star! (people clamoring) Just wait, one second. I've been doing everything I can to make this happen for us and you could've done it with a snap of a finger? Look, you don't understand and you need to back off. You need to get smart. If he was helpful, do you think we'd be in Atlanta working out of a salon right now? I don't know. 'Cause I don't know what you didn't say to him. Clearly, he needs to hear it from somebody else. Alexandra : Hear what? Star : That he needs to produce our demo. If he did, we would get in that contest. We would get a record deal. I-I'm so... I don't understand you. Him? Help us? You don't even know how much that would cost. I grew up in foster care. Stop throwing your sorry-ass foster care story in everyone's face. It's getting tired. Like your dead mom? We all have things to deal with, okay? You had to make yours up. You want to lie to me about who you are and then flip the script? Go ahead. Figure it out for yourself. As usual. I'm gonna go work on this song with Simone. Okay. You're a fake ass bitch. She's a fake ass bitch. And I thought that I was a stunt queen. She a fraud. Her father Roland Crane. ♪ ♪ I can explain. I opened up to you like I never did with nobody else. Why would you front like that? You know what you are? A liar. Derek... Jahil :  Look, I'm telling you right now,  those girls, they ain't no fluke. I mean, they did all of that on short notice. I mean, can you imagine? Can you imagine what they could do with a little bit of money behind them? Look, all I need is $30,000 for this demo. Hunter, you told me you wanted to build outside the NFL anyway, here's your shot, holmes. Arlene : They were good. But music is just like the restaurants I invest in. _ Two weeks after they're open, I want to kill myself. Or you take the risk, Arlene. I mean, 'cause what? For every 100 groups, you might just find a TLC or a Destiny's Child, right? Yeah, well, the girls aren't the risk, Unc. Every time we give you money, it goes right up your nose. What? Why you always on with that, Arlene? I'm clean and you know it. Look, I think you're missing out here. These girls are special. I'm telling you right now. They're special. Well, if they're so special then I'm sure you're gonna have no trouble getting the money. ♪ ♪ Bet on that. You know, he could be right about this one. True. A white girl who could sing R&B. Even the mediocre ones go platinum. (exhales) Watch out for this girl. See if she's really worth it. ♪ And if you just be patient ♪ 
♪ And don't mind waiting ♪ C, what you doing? I had a talk with Jahil. Trifling Mexican. He from Peru. Whatever. What y'all talk about, the girls? Yeah. He reminded me I lost the girls after Mary died. I wanted those girls so bad, but... I don't know if I'm ready for this. You got to give that to God. That's what you know how to do. You taught me that. You got to give it to God. Yeah, well, if they keep working with Jahil, they're gonna get hurt. They ain't gonna get hurt. They got you, flaws and all. But I do know you got to tell them girls the truth. You got to tell them about you and Mary. Y'all past. That's them girls' mama and I think you owe that to them. (sighs) Star ain't exactly the listening type. I don't care if Star's listening or not. You got to be honest. You need to tell them about Jahil, what he did to y'all, whyou don't like him. Ain't about Star. It's about you being honest with yourself. That's the only way you gonna get through all this. And I know them girls, they're gonna be a handful. I don't like none of them. (both chuckle) Real talk. I'm gonna get you a zanny bar. Calm you all the way down. Bring you all the way together. (chuckles) Girl, I ain't messing with that mess. There's enough high people in this house. It worked for me. I finna go get me one, baby, I need one, especially after Roland Crane pumped through here. Can you believe that? Bitch, I about threw up. Bitch, I gagged. (chuckles) ♪ You got to trust me on this ♪ 
♪ 'Cause I really know that you want this. ♪ 
 
 I need you to come home. You're the only one that can handle that woman. I can't take care her anymore, Dad. It's getting worse. And you know I don't help things. She needs you. I just want to focus on my music. I caught some of it on SoundCloud. You know that one song, the one... you know, the one about waves? I think if you just work on the lyric a little bit and... bring in the chorus a little earlier, it's dope. You really think so? I mean, what about Star and Simone? You don't need that trash. Trash? They add a whole new dimension to the sound. Come home. Help your mother, and let me help you. I'll think about it. (turns off engine) Alexandra's about to leave Atlanta. What are you talking about? What happened? Her parents waltzed into the salon today and they're trying to convince her to go back to New York. Wait a minute. I thought she said her mother was dead. She's very much alive. And a bitch. And wait for it, her father is Roland Crane. What? Roland Crane? Roland Crane. Roland Crane, the rock star, Roland Crane? That one. (door closes) And he says he wants to produce her  solo  record. We got to do something, man, or she's gonna go. Ah, you know what? Forget about her. Listen to me. You're the only one I care about anyway. I tell you what, you drop those other two, and you and me, we get your solo record off the ground. I'm not dropping my sister. I told you, we're a package deal. I don't believe that. And you don't believe that either. Okay. All right, Star, hold on a second, whatever you want, all right? But we got a deadline. I'm gonna see if Roland Crane is willing to help. You don't need all that. Hey, Star, I got this. Hey, you don't need to talk to Roland. (tires screeching) Hey, yo! Star, don't do it. Yeah, I need to talk to Maggie. (classical music playing) Atlanta is not a good look, darling. I've seen that  Housewives  show. It's trash. What would you two ladies like to drink? Sparkling water, please. Me, too. Why'd you tell those people I was dead? I mean, you might as well be. You promised you'd stop, Mom. I've left your father again. How did you meet that girl? Instagram. She's a pain in the ass but... she's talented, She's positively repulsive. That's what she is. Good music is made here by people who get us. There's good music made everywhere. Why don't you come back home with me to London? Papa can set you up in Abbey Road Studio. You ever think about, you know, if you followed your heart? Modeled? I'd be a much happier person. You know, your father is a pig. He only cares about one thing and that's himself. But he does love you, Alexandra. And I'm trying to stop. Really. I am. (dog whimpers) Come back.

He said he would talk to us about producing our demo. (scoffs) Do you know how many sluts and groupies he's told whatever they wanted to hear? You know, I knew you were ambitious, but I didn't think you were stupid. You're an idiot. Whore. All right. That's enough. No, Simone, if you're gonna take her side on this, you're just as dumb as she is. Alexandra, calm down. No, no. I'm sick of being the calm one while she gets to act like a damn fool. I was doing what I know how to do. We brought you here because of your money and you won't even use it to help. I came all the way here for you, Star.

I don't know where I'd be without Jesus by my side. Maybe you should give him a try, Alexandra. Thank you for being so kind to me. I really appreciate it, and I'm sorry that I lied to you and... everyone. I didn't think it would get this crazy. So, where you headed? To New York? L.A. maybe. I don't know yet. Miss Carlotta : Hold up, now. Wait a minute. Now, you can't just leave without saying a word. You slept with my father. I did not sleep with him. You were in a bathtub. You took a bath with the man? I took a bath by myself. I never had a bubble bath before. Let alone at The W. I was gonna. But I didn't. I swear. You're crazy. And your crazy outweighs your talent. I think it's pathetic that you're gonna give up because life got just a little bit too hard for you. Simone : Star, just let her go. We'll be fine. All right. Can you take me to my parents? Let me get my keys. (classical music plays) Ugh. I'd given up questioning your taste a long time ago. And now you resorted to children! I'm telling you, she's a con. Shh. Honey, she's coming now and she's bringing that damn hairdresser with her. Before you say anything, your friend came on to me, all right? (voice breaking): That girl will eventually get you to do things you are not proud of. We're a good group and you'll know that someday. So, in case you haven't figured it out... I'm not coming home. But I wanted to make it real clear that you don't own me anymore. And I won't put up with any more of your manipulations, either. So, here. You haven't even begun to understand what you're doing. Roland! Apologize. Apologize? Apologize for what? What? For the-for the schools, and the-and the vacations? And the life I never had? Pfft, please. Alexandra, this isn't necessary. (voice breaking): Mom, you need help. But I don't think I can be the one to help you anymore. (sniffles) Can you talk to her? Please? Well, it seems she made up her mind. You know, it's ironic. You give your kids this-this-this magical, privileged life so they don't have to know how black they are... You know, you? You're a piece of work. I had my doubts about that girl, but after you two? She's better off with us. And you need to stop chasing kids and actually work on your music. Which sucks, by the way. (sobbing quietly) That's all right. When she sees how tough this life is, she'll be back. Filth. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. Star told me you'd be here. (scoffs) What, is she sleeping with you, too, now? I'm sorry. The girls told me you might be leaving. Don't leave me. (whispers): Simone. (gasps) ♪ ♪ Miss Carlotta : Simone, where you at? Are you getting ready to go to church with me? Uh, I'll meet you in the car, Miss Carlotta. I'm ready. (pills rattling) (toilet flushing) Phew. Don't go in there. Oh, God. Okay, you can't smell it from here. Ugh. Hi. I signed us up for the contest. Jahil just needs to get us in the studio. So you're back? Okay, look, this is the last thing I'm gonna say about it, but when I went to your dad, I was really thinking about all of us. I wasn't even thinking about him being your dad. I was just doing what I always do. Which always works, by the way. I did not sleep with him. But I am a whore. (both laugh) A thirsty whore. Yes. Very much so. (laughs) When do you want to work on this? When you're done with it. It's finished. Let's get Simone and rehearse. She went to church with Miss Carlotta. Of course she did. That's all right. I'll queue it up and we'll rehearse with her when she gets here. Hey, hey, y'all. I'm enrolling you in school. You're living with me, you're going to school. Can't just be going to Bible study. Harris : Look what the wind then blew in. Hi, babe. Hey. Simone, when you gonna sing for us? I done gave up trying to convince her. I just don't know any gospel songs. You said you can sing. Okay. Well, sing. If you let the Lord use you, he'll bless you every time. You know what? Help her out. (mic feedback) Y'all gonna pull it together. Thou shall not judge. We ain't judging. He bye, bye, bye see you. Do it, Lord. I saw a cowboy hat in here. Oh, my God, dude, this says Arnold. Do you think that's Cotton's real name? Oh.
