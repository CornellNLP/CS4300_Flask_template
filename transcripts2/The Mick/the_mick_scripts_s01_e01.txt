 Wow. Aunt Mackenzie. 
 I haven't seen you since you were young.

 Sabrina's going to Yale next year. 
 I got into Yale, that doesn't mean I'm going. 
 Well, you sh... 
 That's probably a good call. 
 Cute. 
 Remind me, what do you do again? 
 You know how it goes. 
 Just kind of in between things.

 I don't... but good luck with your things. 
 Thank you.

 Isn't she amazing? 
 Oh, she is. 
 I am amazed. 
 So, listen, Yeah? 
 Poodle. (chuckles) 
 Um, I wanted to give you an opportunity to invest in my future. 
 There it is. 
 This is the Mickey that I know. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I was half your age when I settled down. 
 Settle down? You got knocked up by some rich guy when you were working as a stripper. 
 (whispering): I was waitress at a strip club. 
 You were a topless waitress. 
 Okay. And that's even worse, it just means you couldn't dance.

 Oh, no, no. You just need to get them to school in the morning, okay? 
 Hey. 
 This whole thing is a huge misunderstanding. 
 Have that neighbor lady, the one with the hat? 
 Absolutely not. I'd never hear the end of it. 
 Uh, babysitter? Don't you have a babysitter? 
 Ooh, I know! Get one of those guys outside the hardware store to-to do it. 
 They'll do it. 
 Damn it, Mickey.

 Mommy and Daddy are in jail? 
 (stammering) 
 Don't worry, Ben. 
 The scales of justice tip in favor of the wealthy. 
 If we throw enough money at this thing, I'm sure it will go away. 
 And then we'll sue their asses for defamation, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So, I have an idea. Ooh! 
 Why don't we all just hunker down and play poker all night long, until this whole thing blows over? 
 (scoffs) That's not gonna work for me. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna go to this fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood. 
 Probably crash at my friend's place, go to the city tomorrow. 
 So just don't expect to see me too much. 
 You know, we probably won't see each other at all. 
 But hey, let's catch up again in ten years when you need another loan. 
 Listen, Sabrina, I got a lot riding on this gig, so can you do me a favor and not be a big, giant, pain in the ass, please? 
 Maybe you don't know this, but Planned Parenthood provides health care to over three million women in this country. 
 Oh, sweetie, I know all about Planned Parenthood. 
 I should have one of those punch cards that gets you a free sub every ten visits. 
 Gross. 
 No, I just meant...
