 Previously on  Outsiders...   
 (Big Foster grunts, woman screams)   
 BIG FOSTER: Why did you do it?   
 GORDON: An action at the Coal Days Festival.   
 A real action that gets real attention.   
 Now is not the time to back off.   
 LEDDA: Coal kills! Coal kills!   
 - Arrest her! 
- (crowd murmurs)   
 - What you worried about? 
- Every time you walk out that door.    
 Scared you're not gonna come back.    
 I'm always coming back.    
 Uh, we're getting some noise complaints    
 - from an address over on Maple. 
- (siren wails)    
 (crowd clamoring, cheering)    
 Wait! Hey!    
 Foster Farrell VIII. I know where he is.    
 He's being transferred from a county facility.    
 State prison many, many miles away.   
 Once he gets there, you'll never lay eyes on him again.    
 Just tell us what we have to do.    
 (ATV engines revving)    
 Yeah!    
 (men grunting)    
 Why ain't you dead like you're supposed to be?    
 - What's wrong with you? 
- Get your goddamn hands off me.    
 I brought you home.    
 (panting)    
 Glan lauggh thee.   
 ALL:  Glan lauggh thee!   
 The mountain welcomes you home.    
 Thank you, cousin.    
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.    
 Sorry.    
 Thank you. Sorry.    
 Lil Foster!    
 Living proof that even their prisons can't hold us.    
 (crowd chuckles)    
 Here you are, cousin.    
 What the hell is this, Cornbread?    
 A real live jacket, you peckerwood.    
 (laughter)    
 LIL FOSTER: Oh, wow.    
 Thank you, Cornbread.    
 Ged-gedyah!   
 ALL:  Ged-gedyah!   
 LIL FOSTER:  Ged-gedyah.   
 -  Ged-gedyah. 
-  Ged-gedyah.   
 Ged-gedyah.

 Which house is it?    
 Neighbor said he went in that one.    
 Stay there. Don't let anybody in or out.    
 (door creaking softly)    
 (quiet thumping)    
 (quiet clattering)    
 (gun cocks)    
 Where's the knife?    
 (man yells)    
 (both grunting)    
 Hey!    
 (handcuffs click)    
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 (labored breathing)    
 (Big Foster talking quietly)    
 Foster.    
 I'm here, my queen.    
 Did you get him?    
 Yeah, we did.    
 You can see for yourself soon enough.    
 I... I don't know about that.    
 - I'm gonna die. 
- No.    
 Wound's just taking time to heal is all.    
 You'll be on your feet ordering me around soon as can be.    
 I got dark red lines from the wound.    
 Well, then tell me what to do.    
 Wait, no, we got everything right here.    
 Just tell me what to do with it.    
 No point. There's nothing here that can fix it.    
 Foster, listen to me.    
 When I go, that Oak will be yours again.    
 And you have changed.    
 I've seen it.    
 But the darkness is still there, too.    
 So I'm afraid, Foster, that if you lead us again, more blood will be spilled.     
 So promise me.     
 When that Oak is in your hand, that you will keep the darkness at bay.     
 Well, don't go, and I won't have to.     
 Promise me, Foster.     
 ALL:  Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 -  Obaith wylarn myrr... 
- Oh, so this is your plan, huh?     
 Right.     
 Build a pile, making it out of... making it out of twigs and junk, kneeling, mumbling to yourselves? 
Well, you might as well be     
 wallowing, squealing pigs 
for all the good you're doing.     
 - We're giving her our strength. 
- Ah.     
 Mountain's gonna heal her.     
 Oh, the mountain?     
 You want to count on that, you go right ahead, but I'm actually gonna go do something.     
 ALL:  Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 You sure you got to go? It's been real good having you back.     
 Yeah, well, I promised the Bren'in     
 I wasn't gonna live back and forth.     
 But you just came back to help Lil Foster.     
 Well, that's done now.     
 BIG FOSTER: Hey, Hasil.     
 We're going down with you.     
 - What? 
- Yep.     
 G'Win is dying. She can't well minister to herself.     
 And even if she could, what's the matter with her will take more than roots and berries to fix. Down below, they got things.     
 They got pills and needles, people know what to do with 'em.     
 So we got to go get her help.     
 Hell yeah.     
 Look, Foster, I-I don't want her...     
 You don't want her what?     
 I can't even imagine it, but look, after everything that we just done, going right back down there? I...     
 - I just, I don't know. 
- Ah.     
 Look, maybe... maybe she's meant to die, all right?     
 So that you can be the Bren'in.     
 (grunts)     
 Don't you ever, ever, ever say anything like that again, not any of you. Don't you even think it!     
 Now, G'Win is not just our Bren'in, she is the best of us!     
 If anyone here thinks that we are better off without her, that man is gonna have to answer to me!     
 Now, any of you don't help me, you'll be putting her in the ground with your own hands, huh?     
 Now y'all coming with me or not?     
 For the Bren'in.     
 -  Ged-gedyah. 
-  Ged-gedyah   
 Ged-gedyah!   
 Ged-gedyah.   
 Sheriff.     
 Hey. There he is.     
 - (cheering and applause) 
- Okay.     
 - Okay. 
- You're the man.     
 - Good job. 
- All right, just doing my job.     
 - Nice police work, Wade. 
- Thanks, Matt.     
 No, really, I'm impressed.     
 Yeah, well...     
 I'll cherish that forever.     
 (laughs) Fair enough.     
 'Course there's still the matter of our other escapee.     
 Though not much of a mystery about where he's gone, is there?     
 No.     
 Don't suppose you want me and the deputies charging back up there?     
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no.     
 Yeah, you, uh, don't suppose correctly.     
 Mind if I close the door?     
 - Uh... 
- 'Course you didn't want him locked up in the first place, did you?     
 What's that?     
 You didn't want to lock him up.     
 We had a particularly feisty conversation about it, as I recall.     
 Yeah, I... we did.     
 What's your point?     
 Nothing, just it was something that you had very strong feelings about.     
 And, you know, who knows what someone would do with a feeling that strong.     
 Yeah, well, I mean, I...     
 I couldn't really do anything, considering that you pretty much shut me down.     
 Yeah.     
 Well, the Farrells took care of it.     
 Lucky thing they got a hold of that prisoner transfer schedule.     
 Somehow.     
 Right?     
 Say, didn't you answer a noise complaint the other night about some fight club?     
 Heard there was a Farrell there.     
 Did you get a chance to talk to him?     
 No.     
 No I didn't, he ran away.     
 Hmm.     
 Are you spying on me?     
 There some reason I would need to?     
 Well, it's just that if there's anyone to blame for all this, it's you.     
 What?     
 Well, I mean you put that fella in jail for no good reason, you know, put up that stupid fence.     
 I mean... you're stupid.     
 You've been provoking them since the minute you got here... what'd you think was gonna happen?     
 Don't look at me cross-eyed just 'cause you've been handling this all wrong.     
 Lot of coincidences, that's all.     
 And as for how I'm handling them?     
 Things will be a little different on that front from now on.     
 (door opens)     
 (sighs) Oh.     
 - Hey, Carol. 
- Ledda. Hi.     
 - Hey. Oh. 
- Here.     
 What is it?     
 Just... come in.     
 (applause)     
 (all cheering)     
 (cheering and whistling)     
 (sighs)     
 (door opens)     
 - Hey. 
- Wade.     
 Um...     
 I need to talk to you.     
 Listen, we have had this conversation, okay?     
 - No... 
- We just need to each do what it is     
 - we're gonna do, Wade. 
- No, no, no.     
 I need you to say that I was at home two nights ago.     
 - The night before Coal Days. 
- Wh...     
 You need me to say that to who?     
 Anyone who asks.     
 Wh... Why, where were you?     
 You can't ask me any questions.     
 Wade, what did you do?     
 Okay.     
 Thank you.     
 Look, since we're asking for things...     
 (sighs)     
 ...I'd like you to lay off my group.     
 What?     
 Mountain Witness.     
 We're gonna be stepping things up even more, and I would appreciate it if you'd give us a little latitude.     
 It's not really a good time.     
 It's a perfect time.     
 People are more energized than ever.     
 - It is the perfect time. 
- Ledda, Ledda, you haven't got any pets left.     
 So next it's gonna be one of the kids.     
 Look at you.     
 I mean, in your condition?     
 You're running yourself to death as it is.     
 Look... you asked me for a favor, and I'm asking you for a favor.     
 I got a job to do.     
 Okay. Yeah.     
 Ledda...     
 (sighs)     
 - (knocks) 
- I come in peace.     
 To do what?     
 To apologize for the coal dust. Whoa...     
 Police can be here in five minutes.     
 In the meantime, I've got Mace in my bag.     
 Really, I'm just here to say I'm sorry.     
 Apology not accepted.     
 Why don't you tell me why you're really here?     
 You know, every time I do this, there's always one of you.     
 The boots on the ground getting dirty for the higher-ups.     
 But what do you really get when it's all over and they're done using you?     
 You know, I'm gonna answer your question with a question.     
 In all the times that you've done this,     
 have you ever actually won?     
 Well, I guess that depends on what you mean by winning.     
 I mean stopped the thing you went there to stop.     
 Once or twice. Not usually.     
 But it's not about the battle, it's about the war.     
 And that is far from over.     
 Listen, Haylie, how much do you actually know about this place?     
 This mountain that you're so determined to destroy?     
 I'm going up there for a hike this weekend.     
 Why don't you come with me?     
 See what's actually up there,     
 what you want to just sweep away.     
 You know...     
 everywhere I go, there's one of you.     
 An activist who thinks I can be shamed or bullied     
 or manipulated or talked around.     
 Who thinks I'm not gonna do my job,     
 the job I'm paid, and paid very well, to do.     
 I wonder why that is?     
 (Haylie clears her throat)     
 (door opens, hinges creak)     
 (people outside chanting quietly)     
 (door closes)     
 I wish I would've been here.     
 I would've protected you.     
 I would've protected you till my dying breath.     
 I know now why you did what you did, marrying my Fa.     
 You did what you had to do to survive.     
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 (indistinct voices)     
 (quietly): Could we go around?     
 (quietly): This is  around.   
 This is the way they don't usually guard.     
 Let's just wait a minute, maybe they'll just head off.     
 (low chatter, laughing)     
 Oh, the hell with this.     
 GUARD: Who's there?!     
 Foster, stop, you're gonna get killed.     
 - BIG FOSTER: Wait, go, go, go, go, go! 
- (gunfire)     
 - Go, go! Go, go, go! 
- (gunfire continue)     
 - Go! 
- GUARD: Stay where you are!     
 - Don't move! 
- (gunfire)     
 - (Enoch cries out) 
- Oh, Enoch!     
 - Phil'up! Phil'up! 
- Enoch!     
 (gunfire continues)     
 Trevor!     
 (gunfire continues)     
 (grunts)     
 BIG FOSTER: Stay with us, boy.     
 Right here, okay. Just stay with us.     
 Are you okay?     
 Okay, come one.     
 Come on, cousin.     
 Boy, come on.     
 Come on, cousin, come on, just stay.     
 Stay right here, okay, boy?     
 Maybe we should... go down...     
 - and get me some medicine. 
- Enoch.     
 (Enoch laughing weakly)     
 (gasping)     
 Come on.     
 Come on!     
 Come on.     
 - Enoch... 
- No, no.     
 Don't you touch him!     
 You done enough!     
 Come on.     
 Phil'up, come on.     
 (metallic creaking)     
 (hinges creaking)     
 (knocking "Shave and a Haircut")     
 MAN (inside): Yeah?     
 I got a delivery for Steve.     
 Hi. I'm Steve.     
 Well, sh1t.     
 - I don't know where he's at. 
- Oh, you don't?     
 No. I mean, he went back to the mountain, so, you know...     
 So like, he went back up the mountain,     
 or you don't know where he's at, I mean, which one?     
 Both. Both of those.     
 Listen, I just want to talk to him.     
 - I need an address. 
- He's not there all the time.     
 Not where all the time?     
 (door hinges creak)     
 (door closes)     
 Let me guess.     
 I should see the other guy, right?     
 Sally-Ann, not right now.     
 So when then?     
 'Cause this baby's coming     
 - whether you're ready or not. 
- I know that.     
 All right, but you have no idea what I just been through.     
 So tell me.     
 Hasil, just tell me.     
 HASIL (inhales deeply): Mm.     
 Forget it.     
 I know this song by heart.     
 "Something that you had to do for your family."     
 What are you doing?     
 I'm going to stay with a cousin in Cleveland.     
 Where is that?     
 (sighs)     
 All right, so what-what you gonna do? You just gonna go?     
 You just gonna walk out the door?     
 Because Sally-Ann, I need you right now.     
 I need you!     
 I  need  you, Hasil.     
 And you just...     
 I'm going to Butch and Frida's for the night,     
 - and I'll be back tomorrow. 
- (Hansil sniffles)     
 And if you're here,     
 then you're here for good.     
 And if not, I will pack the rest of my things and I'll go.     
 Because I can't do this...     
 anymore.     
 (door opens, closes)     
 CROWD (quietly): 
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 (chanting quiets)     
 (low murmuring)     
 EMELYE: Shame on you, Foster.     
 SALLY-ANN:  I said it to him.   
 I said that the thing that scares me the most     
 is that one day, you're just gonna go away     
 and not come back.     
 And what does he do?     
 He goes away and he doesn't come back.     
 Well, he's working. He's trying to provide.     
 I know what they're doing, Frida.     
 I hear he's really good at it.     
 I'm sure.     
 I saw him fight plenty the week that we met,     
 but that's not the point. The point is:     
 that I can't count on him.     
 And this time, I'm not even sure he was with Butch.     
 Where do you think he was?     
 I got a cousin in Cleveland.     
 I don't know her all that well, but I gave her a call and...     
 ...I'm-a go stay with her.     
 For the baby.     
 You do what you think you need to do,     
 but love ain't easy to find.     
 This may come as a surprise to you, but Butch,     
 he ain't perfect. Mm-mm.     
 There are times when he is talking     
 and I just want to stab him right in the eye,     
 but he loves me.     
 And he takes care of me.     
 And he accepts me as I am.     
 And Hasil loves you.     
 And he is cute!     
 (chuckles) I mean, that hair.     
 I'm just saying...     
 if I was you, I would think twice     
 before I threw all that away.     
 I don't think I can do it.     
 Everything I touch...     
 blood...     
 and more blood.     
 If I take that Oak,     
 the darkness is gonna win.     
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 - BIG FOSTER: Son? 
- (chanting continues)     
 Can I speak with you?     
 Why?     
 Just come with me. Please.     
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 LIL FOSTER: You want me to follow you back down there     
 so I could be the next to be killed?     
 BIG FOSTER: You heard about Enoch.     
 LIL FOSTER: Of course I did.     
 BIG FOSTER: Oh... oh.     
 My father, Foster V,     
 you were just a boy when he passed,     
 but he was like the sun, the moon and the stars to me.     
 He was powerful, and he was warm,     
 and he led by love, not fear,     
 with that Oak in his hand and then,     
 he was gone.     
 And my mother,     
 she took it.     
 And she was terrible to me.     
 She shamed me every chance she got,     
 with that mountain Oak by her side.     
 And after a while,     
 it was all I wanted to get my hands on that Oak.     
 So I became the demon.     
 Me.     
 G'Win is right.     
 We've tainted this mountain.     
 I have. I have tainted it...     
 by what I've done.     
 I killed my mother, I killed our ways.     
 And try as I might to change,     
 I kill everything I touch.     
 The mountain, it wants a sacrifice,     
 and right now, it's taking G'Win.     
 And nothing that we do to heal her     
 is gonna help, short of someone taking her place.     
 So, I need you to do something for me.     
 'Cause it ain't gonna work     
 if I do it myself.     
 I need you...     
 to kill me.     
 I know just the place.     
 (door opens)     
 BARTENDER: Another glass of wine?     
 
 
 
 - HAYLIE: Yes, please. 
- (phone keys clicking)     
 Well, hello again.     
 You know stalking's illegal.     
 Are we ever gonna have a conversation     
 that doesn't begin with you threatening     
 to sick law enforcement on me?     
 I think the real question is:     
 why are we having so many conversations?     
 Thank you.     
 So is this how you spend your evenings?     
 Alone in a hotel bar?     
 Are you concerned about me, Gordon?     
 No, I mean, it's just a little sad is all.     
 You know, what, with all the culture this place has to offer.     
 (laughs)     
 (groans)     
 I'm serious. There's a whole world out here.     
 You are still trying to get me to come on that hike, huh?     
 No, but the offer is still open.     
 Here, check this out.     
 (sighs) What are those?     
 I've been a lot of places, like I said.     
 And everywhere I go, I come across     
 what they call outsider art,     
 just paintings,     
 sculpture, music.     
 Ah, here we go.     
 Totally unschooled local folks     
 following some sort of inner muse.     
 Untainted by whatever fashionable idea of what art     
 should or shouldn't be.     
 Okay.     
 It's a little compilation I made,     
 of music performed by those people     
 that I've met on my travels.     
 I'm still not seeing what that has to do with me.     
 Well, if I can't bring you to see what you're killing,     
 maybe I'll bring what you're killing... to you.     
 So you want me to listen to it.     
 Yeah. (chuckles)     
 How? Holding it up to my ear?     
 You're telling me you don't have a means to play that thing?     
 - Come on. 
- Not here in the bar, no.     
 All right, well, maybe we don't stay at the bar.     
 - You've got to be kidding me. 
- What?     
 That's the worst pick-up line I've ever heard in my life.     
 "Let's go back to your room     
 "so I can play you my compilation CD     
 of Appalachian hill people music?"     
 (laughs)     
 (whoops) Nice try.     
 All right. Fine, suit yourself.     
 But it's really good.     
 Try again.     
 (Appalachian music plays)     
 (Gordon sighs)     
 (Appalachian music continues)     
 (Haylie moaning)     
 (knocking)     
 Who is it?     
 It's Wade.     
 HASIL: Wade. Who?     
 It's the sheriff.     
 The river becomes a flood.     
 What's that?     
 (door closes)     
 Nothing. Long day, what do you want?     
 Well, um, good job.     
 Nobody got hurt doing that, uh...     
 the thing.     
 What thing?     
 Right.     
 Anyway...     
 what I was thinking is,     
 with everything that's going on,     
 I think it wouldn't be bad idea for you to leave town.     
 For good.     
 That so?     
 I mean, you're obviously pretty identifiable walking around.     
 With things amping up,     
 I can't protect you.     
 So I think it'd be better if you just disappear.     
 Okay.     
 What's that mean? "Okay."     
 It means okay.     
 It means I'll disappear.     
 It means you ain't gonna see me around here ever again.     
 Oh, okay.     
 Um...     
 This is a real nice place.     
 HASIL: Mm-hmm.     
 (door opens)     
 (door closes)     
 LIL FOSTER:  You said your father   
 was the sun, the moon and the stars.   
 Every boy sees his father that way.     
 You remember that time...     
 I must've been, what, ten?...     
 we was out hunting buck and I crouched in the brush,     
 and I stepped on a twig or something.     
 Scared 'em all off. You remember that?     
 You remember what you did?     
 To show me what a bad mistake it was.     
 You tied me to a tree...     
 and left me there for ten days.     
 Passed out from the thirst and the hunger.     
 Chafed so bad from the rope, it nearly hit bone.     
 That weren't...     
 that weren't the last thing you ever done to me, neither.     
 That's the tree right there.     
 BIG FOSTER: All right.     
 Then do it. Huh?     
 Do it. Kill me.     
 I killed my mother.     
 You got to kill me.     
 So go ahead. Go ahead and do it.     
 Everything that Lady Ray passed down to you,     
 you passed down to me ten times.     
 Still, I loved you.     
 No, I ain't gonna kill you.     
 It's better to let you live, suffer through it.     
 You are the demon.     
 Spilling more blood just taints this mountain more.     
 (grunts)     
 You're the only one that can save her.     
 All right? So do it!     
 If you don't do it,     
 - she will die. 
- You...     
 She never loved you.     
 Farrells don't kill Farrells.     
 (panting)     
 (gun clicking)     
 Elon.     
 My boy.     
 My son.     
 Are you...     
 Are you really here?     
 (whimpers)     
 Oh, I'm so sorry.     
 I am sorry that I let you get hurt.     
 Thank you for letting me see you one more time.     
 I've missed you so much.     
 (whispering)     
 Thank you.

 (beeps)     
 (door opens, closes)     
 (sighs)     
 Still here.     
 (Hasil grunts)     
 Something bad happened.     
 One of my cousins,     
 a friend, he got hit by a bullet.     
 We got separated, and now I don't know     
 if he's alive or dead.     
 You want to go to him?     
 (Hasil inhales)     
 (exhales)     
 Won't make any difference now.     
 I'm sorry.     
 Anyway, there's something that I got to do for my family.     
 FRIDA: Come on out and show us!     
 HASIL: Don't want to.     
 SALLY-ANN: Babe?     
 - Come on. 
- (chuckles)     
 Come on.     
 SALLY-ANN (quietly): Oh...     
 (Sally-Ann laughs softly)     
 (chuckling): All right. Look...     
 - I look ridiculous. 
- SALLY-ANN (laughing): No! No.     
 - It's cute. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 And it's just temporary. Okay?     
 Until we find you something that's more... you.     
 Good, 'cause Butch is gonna want these clothes back anyway.     
 Why?     
 (quietly): Don't know why.     
 Beggars can't be choosers, y'all.     
 No, it's just, I-I look in the mirror,     
 and I just, I don't see myself.     
 That's kind of the point, isn't it?     
 I guess. Yeah.     
 Hey.     
 I see you. Okay?     
 (Hasil grunts)     
 I see  you,  even in all this.     
 Come here.     
 Mm... (laughs)     
 Uh... I'm just gonna let myself out, then.     
 (laughs) Excuse me.     
 (Sally-Ann giggles)     
 (door opens)     
 (Ledda clears her throat)     
 What happened?     
 Hilda?     
 Your daughter was in a fight.     
 A what? A fight?     
 - It wasn't my fault, Mom. 
- Okay, what happened?     
 She grabbed one of her classmates and threw her     
 to the ground. They had to be separated.     
 My daughter would never do that.     
 I mean, not unless she was provoked.     
 What did this other girl do to her?     
 Apparently, she said something about you.     
 About how your organization's hurting the town. Now,     
 the other girl's parents are prepared to let this thing go,     
 but the school's policy on violence mandates     
 - a three day suspension on a first... 
- Uh, h-hang on,     
 hang on, hang on. W-What... (chuckles)     
 What about your policy for insulting someone's mother?     
 - Mom... 
- No.     
 - Why is my daughter 
the only one on the hook here? - Mom.     
 What... happened to this other girl and what she said?     
 What kind of message does that send? Huh?     
 Punishing someone for standing up for what is right     
 and l-letting the person who started it all comple...     
 (coughing)     
 You all right, Mrs. Dobbs?     
 - (coughing) 
- Mom?     
 HOUGHTON:  It's not too late to start treatment, you know that.   
 I mean, everything I said...     
 - you can still do that. 
- No.     
 I still don't want to do that.     
 (chuckles) You were right, though, Wade.     
 I just... I felt so good,     
 doing what I was doing.     
 But, uh, I can't...     
 I can't outrun this forever.     
 I love you very much.     
 You know I'm gonna...     
 I'll take care of them.     
 - (sniffles) 
- I'll take care of everything.     
 I know.     
 You have to tell them.     
 (sniffling)     
 I know.     
 (exhales)     
 Will... Will you stay here?     
 - Yeah. 
- Okay.     
 I'll bring them in.     
 Okay.     
 (door opens)     
 HOUGHTON: Hey, Hilda, Abby.     
 Come on.     
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 - (door opens) 
-  Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.   
 Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

 (excited murmuring continues)
