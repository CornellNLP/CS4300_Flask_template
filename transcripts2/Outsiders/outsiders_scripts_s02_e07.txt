 - Previously on  Outsiders... 
  - HOUGHTON:  You railroaded  that kid on that murder charge. 
   I told you he was innocent and he was.  Foster Farrell killed an inmate. 
  Broke his neck. 
    (cheering) 
    Hasil Farrell, you're a rich man. 
    So you gonna tell me how you got this black eye? 
    I fight. 
    I fight people. 
     This is your fault. 
  You need to quit  - that group of yours. 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm not gonna do that, Wade. That is never gonna happen.     My name is Gordon.  I'm not from here, but I heard about you from all the way across the country.     You guys are amazing.     All of this is my fault.     I didn't do something when I should have.     I know what I have to do, but it's not necessarily legal.     So the strongest of you must die.     You're gonna kill a man for his blood.     MOREGON:  Not me. You.  (gasping, screaming)     G'WIN: Moregon, wait.     - (all gasp, women screaming)  - BIG FOSTER: Cut me loose!     (yells)     (quietly): G'Winveer.  My queen.     My queen.     (women chanting in foreign language, echoing)     ♪ ♪    Any trouble?     Not a lick.     Snake with the head gone can't bite.     BIG FOSTER: A snake's head can strike long after it's cut off.     No.  They ain't to be trusted.     What do we do with them?     That's for the Bren'in to decide once she's mended.     - EMELYE: Foster.  Foster!  - Hmm.     She's awake.

I...     I wanted to make a poultice.     Bloodwort and speckled alder.     I started it, but the...  the room got to spinning.     Well, let's get you back down.     - I'm fine.  - No.  You need to rest.     Hey.  You just let me take care of you now.     - (winces)  - Oh.  I got you.     - (moans)  - No.  I got you.     Okay.  There you go.     (grunts)     (coughs)     I really...  I got to make a poult...     No.  You...  let me do it.     Huh, G'Win?     What if it was all a dream?     What?     The Kinnah.     What if they were some kind of...     vision?     Conjured by the mountain, sent to warn us?     No.  No.  We got cousins cold and dead thanks to them witches.     That weren't no vision.     Are they still among us?     We're watching them.     Waiting, until you're ready to decide their punishment.     Free them.     - You don't mean that.  - I do.     Let them go.     What?  So they can run off?  Get their strength back up, come back after us again with fresh terrors?     It was her, Foster.     It was Moregon.     The others, without her, they're...     they're lost.     Then we will do as you wish.     Yeah.  We will set them free.     Probably walk off a cliff, the whole lot of them, without that demon to lead them.     But what if she was right?     Oh.     - Now, that's the fever talking.  - No.     No.  What if...     it's us killing the mountain?      Not those below, I mean, we're...      we're no better than them.      We're fighting amongst ourselves, we're...  we're taking on their ways.      We're drowning our good in all manner of vice and impurity.      Hey, hey, hey, hey.      You calm yourself.  Huh?      Don't give that monster a fresh thought.      Hey.      (G'Win winces)      Why?      Why did you do it?      You should've killed me, like they wanted.      I was ready.      Oh, please, please.      Don't die.      Please don't die.      (crying): You can't.      I can.      And I likely will.      MEYERS:  What is it with you   and your weird fascination with the Farrells?      HOUGHTON:  There's a man in county right now.   I helped put him in there.   That's weighin' on me pretty damned heavy right now.      FOSTER:  I believe you, Wade.  But if you're lying, you're gonna pay for it. All of this is my fault.  - Hey.      I have to run everybody back to the house     for breakfast before school.      The girls are already in the car.      Well...  I mean, we got breakfast here.      There's cereal.      Well, what are we gonna pour over it?      That milk you got is halfway to yogurt.      Go brush your teeth, sweetie.      - I already did.  - Okay.      Go wait in the car with the girls.      - Your bag.  - LEDDA: Hey.      HOUGHTON: You gonna give me a hug?      Have a good day.      - (door opens)  - Hey.      (door closes)      Were you drinking last night?      No.      Not a drop.      Yeah?  'Cause you were talking crazy.      Mm-hmm.      I said a lot of stuff I...      probably shouldn't have said.      I'm sorry.      Well.      I was worried about you.      Well.  We got enough to worry about without worrying about me.      - Hey, listen.  - What?  Look, I got to go.      I don't want to go uprooting the girls, so, let's move back to your house.      I'll assign one of my deputies, post him out front for the next week or so.      That okay by you?      Yeah.  Thank you, Wade.      Okay.      - DOLAN:  Dolan.  - (line ringing)      Dolan.  It's Wade, here.  How you doing?      - Oh, morning, Sheriff.  - Hey.  Uh, listen, I was thinking about coming out to see you guys on Sunday.      I want to talk to that Farrell fella some more, ask him a few questions about Breece.      Oh, Sunday'll be too late.      He's getting shipped off to state pen in Central City tomorrow afternoon.      State?  They're...  They're gonna take him to state?      - You heard what he did, right?  - Yeah.      Guy he killed was a first-class piece of sh1t, but rules are rules.      I feel sorry for the poor b*st*rd.      Born free as a jaybird.  Now he's gonna spend     the rest of his life in a concrete box.      ♪ ♪     - (counter bell jingles)  - You here for the order?      Cup of coffee, too, if it's not too much trouble, Dorothy.      Sure thing.  Bet your kids are excited about the parade tomorrow.      Yeah.  They are.      - Thanks.  - Sure.      Hello.      Mm.      Hope your Mountain Witness people like cold cuts.      - There's one more.  - (they chuckle)      Thanks.      MAN: That's what I thought.      You're that...  Ledda Dobbs.      You run...      you run that Mountain Witness organization.      Raising ruckus.      With coal people.      Yeah.  That's me.      Well, ma'am, my name is...  Ennis Melaney.      And I worked in coal     for    years.      My whole working life.      And them bastards,     they took my lungs.      And I won't get     to meet all my grandkids.      Won't...      I won't get...      to spend time     with the ones I already met,     ma'am.      You...      You keep doing what you're doing.      Fighting     the good fight.      Thank you.      TOWNIE GUARD: Help you?      Yeah.  You can get out of my way.      Sorry, Sheriff.  I didn't recognize you.      - What you doing way up here?  - We got a call     about a rabid dog.      Ain't seen or heard no dogs.      Yeah, well.  I'm-a go take a look.      Uh...  I can't really let you do that, Sheriff.      Excuse me?      Uh, anybody wants to go up past this point here, I got to clear it with Mr.  Meyers' office.      They're calling all this private property.      You know Mr.  Meyers has no authority over local law enforcement?  You know that, right?      I-I ain't worked in nearly two years before this, Sheriff.      I got six kids.  I got to do what they tell me.      Someone gets dog bit, it's on you.      Yes, sir.      Goddamn it.      Shame it has to end this way.      Gonna miss you, boy.      What, are you leaving?      No, you.      Green Valley State Penitentiary.  Heading out tomorrow.      Green Valley?  I'm guessing it's neither one of those things.      WALT: You'd be right.      You'd best enjoy the sunlight while you can.      - Roll on   !  - (gate buzzes)      (people yelling, sirens wailing on video)      (video stops)      Creek River, Oregon.      Local communities have been fighting dam construction in Southern Oregon for years.      This is how heated things got.      But did it work?      Did you stop them from building the dam?      No.      (laptop closes)      But over nine million people saw that video.      Look, I didn't show you that to scare you, okay?      A serious action doesn't come without its risks.      Look, I'm not saying that something like this is gonna happen tomorrow, but you never know.      (murmuring)      Look, I don't know about you all, but I am tired of feeling small.      I am tired of watching everything around me fade and die because of a bunch of rich outsiders pretending that I don't exist.      They pollute our air, they make us sick, they promise us jobs that never come.      I am done begging for scraps at my own table and I know that you are, too.      The parade is our chance to show them who we are.      How angry we are.      And tomorrow...      we will.      (door closes)      HASIL: Hey, uh...      Hey.      I got you dinner.      Um, was a bit of a long line, but I think I remembered everything.      I'm still a little nervous about the money, though.      I always feel like they're taking more than they should, but I'm learning.      You good?      Let's just eat.      I do something?      No.  Everything's fine.      I can see that.      Is it about the fighting?      (sniffs)      Look, we haven't talked about it, really.      I know you don't like it, but I'm doing what I got to do.      This food wouldn't be here if it wasn't for...      It's not about the fighting.      I like the fighting.      But you...      I didn't at first.      I hated it.      I was always worried about you getting hurt, but...      then I realized that you're just doing it to make money to support us...      me and the baby.      How many fathers would do that for their child?      So, when I think about it, I don't worry as much.      You're like a warrior.      (scoffs)  Hmm.      (chuckles)      To be completely honest, it kind of turns me on.      It makes me want to be with you.      In that way.      Oh...      I get it.      - I like that way.  - (chuckles)      I still don't understand what you're so upset about.      I just worry.      Can't help it.      Come here.      Come here.      What are you worried about?      I think that every time you walk out that door, just scared you're not gonna come back.      A lot of things to be afraid of in this world.      Not that, darling.      It doesn't matter where I go, I'm always coming back.      (chuckles)      (sighs)      (sighs)      (keys jingling)      (sighs)      (knocking)      sh1t.      HAYLIE: Sheriff?      - Yeah?  - Sheriff, are you okay?      I heard something break.      What you doing in there?      Uh, what?      Isn't that Matt's area?      Yeah, uh, but this is all the property of Crockett County Sheriff's Department and, you know...      I mean, I'm the sheriff, so I can go where I want.      I just wanted to check in with you about tomorrow.      - About the parade.  - Yeah?      That's all going well.      I'm gonna have a few deputies with me.      And, uh, we're taking care of it.      So we're not expecting any trouble from your sister - and her little group?  - Oh, no.      No.  No, not that I know of.      Maybe you should ask her.      Tell her not to cause any disturbance.      It's a family event, you know?      Yeah, I...  I'm aware of that, we're...  we're handling it.      JEANNIE: I'm sorry, Sheriff?      Yeah, go.  Jeannie, shoot.      Um, we're getting some noise complaints from an address over on Maple, a machine shop.      Deputy Fults is busy with a DUI over on Highway  .      Okay, damn, that means I-I got to go.      I got to take care of this.  Have a nice night.      - I'll walk out with you.  - Uh, no.      That's okay.      I'll see you later.      (door closes)      (fighters grunting, crowd cheering)      (siren blaring)      Hey, that's it.  Okay, clear it out now.      You heard me, let's move.      Evening, Sheriff.  Everything good?      No, otherwise I wouldn't be here.      I'm shutting it down.      I thought we had an understanding.      We had an understanding, which is you and your friends can beat the tar out of each other as much as you like as long as you don't do it in a residential neighborhood.      - What?  These folks don't care.  - These folks are calling me.      All right, I'll clear 'em out as soon as we've done this last fight.  It should be a quick one.      Now, look, you...  you want to grab a beer?      No, I'm on duty.      But, you know what, I'm gonna come in and take a look around.      - You good with that?  - Now, Wade, you don't need...      Wade, best you wait out here.  What...      - Wade.  - (crowd yelling)      (fighters grunting)      Wait!      Hold up!      HOUGHTON: Wait!      (yells)      HOUGHTON: Wait!      Hold on!      Wait!      (panting)      Foster Farrell VIII!      (breathing heavily)      What about him?      I know where he is.      You don't know sh1t.      It's okay.      It's just my phone.      Where'd you get that?      HOUGHTON: He got in a fight.      He was arrested.      They got him in the county jail.      I have to help him.      I need to come up there.      I need to talk to your people.      And I can't get up there without you.      They ain't gonna talk to you.      It's the last chance you have to save him.      You don't help me now, he'll be lost to you forever.      HASIL: All right.      This is far enough.  Why don't you wait here?      I'm-a head on up, get a read on things.      (panting)      No.  No, I'll come with you.      You drop in without any warning, it's just gonna be worse for you, so why don't you do what I say?      Sit tight, all right?      How long do I have to wait here for?      The sun gets halfway up that tree and I ain't back, then you get your ass out of here as fast as you can.      I mean that.      (Houghton breathing heavily)      (exhales forcefully)      (spits)      (knocking at door)      - You let them Kinnah go free?  - Yes, sir.      They sat there for the longest time, like they didn't understand.      But they finally wandered off.      Was carrying the dead one with 'em.      Oh, well, then you follow 'em.      Make sure they don't circle back.      Yes, sir.      (knocking at door)      BIG FOSTER: Oh, well, well.      Look who's here.      What the hell do you want?      I need to see the Bren'in.      Oh.      Is that Hasil?      HASIL: Yes, ma'am.      You're sick.      BIG FOSTER: Wounded.      Defending her people.      Against who?      Well, you would know that, wouldn't you?  If you were here, instead of down below with your townie friend.      G'WIN: Hasil.      I found Lil Foster.      (gun hammer clicks)      I'm not armed.      TREVOR: Well, that's unfortunate for you 'cause we are.      BARNABIS: You don't belong here.      I know that, but I was brought here to talk to your Bren'in.      Brought up by who?      By Hasil Farrell.      BARNABIS: We're gonna see about that.      BIG FOSTER:  My boy  locked away in a cage like an animal?      I knew I should've gone after him.  I knew it.      You know this for a surety, Hasil?      - I do.  - BIG FOSTER: Yeah?      - You see him locked away?  - HASIL: I didn't see him...      but the, uh, the lawman that we chased off a while back...      he told me.      The lawman?      Oh, and what makes you think that there's a thread of truth coming off his lips?      He is our sworn enemy.      And I believe him.      All right?  I brought him up here because he knows how to save Lil Foster, our kin, your son.      No, no, wait a minute.      Boy...      what did you just say?      You did what?      He knows how to save Lil Foster.      That should be the only thing we talk about right now.      Oh, I agree...  only now, thanks to your thick head, we got bigger problems.      - How many are there coming up?  - Just one man.      Oh, just the one that you saw, huh?      Probably a hundred more following behind.      Or you just too blind to see?      It's one man.      BARNABIS: Big Foster, get out here!      This could be them right now.      You put him in the box, huh.      He tries to run, you shoot him dead.      HASIL: Don't touch me.      BIG FOSTER: How many are there?      - What do you mean?  - The others.      Give me their number.      There's no one else.      Hey, Foster!      Talk now, John Law, or never talk again.      Got two seconds.  Tell me how many there are and which direction they'll be coming from.      Foster, there ain't no army.      Will you take him out of here?!      All right, time's up.      I am done with you.      EMELYE: Foster!  Stop!      The Bren'in wants to see him.      I don't want her dealing with this.  She needs rest.      Your Bren'in has spoken.      You show her every respect or I will send you back down below in pieces.      (under breath): Okay.      Come on.      - You ready for today?  - (Ledda chuckles)      My daddy used to take me when I was a little girl to the Coal Days parade.      It was a big deal.      Even marched in it a few times.      I am glad that he's not gonna be around to see what's gonna happen.      He wouldn't approve? 
 
      (laughs)  Oh, no.      He would ground me for the rest of my life, even at this age.      He was tough.  He was super pro-coal.      Uh, listen, um...      uh, that thing that happened between us the other day...      In the shower?      Yeah, that.  Uh, it was, uh...  not me.      It was...  very out of character.  I just...      I enjoyed it.      I'm sorry to hear that you didn't.      (chuckling): Oh, no.  God, no.      No, I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong.      - Mm-hmm.  - It just...      uh, it probably shouldn't happen again.      "It probably shouldn't" meaning it possibly could.      No.  Really.      Look, let's wait till after this afternoon.      If we have something to celebrate, then we'll discuss it again.      You are trouble.      - (both chuckle)  - You really are.      You have no idea.      I know you.      Yes...  yes, ma'am, you do.      Last time you were up here, you led an invasion.      It was not an invasion.      It was an investigation.      A man from the town was killed on this mountain by one of your people.      His name was Breece Dobbs.      We were here to apprehend his killer.      Why are you here now?      Because Foster Farrell VIII is in prison for that murder.      Foster Farrell VIII did not kill that man.      I know, and I was able to prove it, but things happened, things beyond my control.      Now you, I mean, you and your people, you're the only ones who can save him.      I could tell you everything you need to know, but...  I can't be involved after this.      Well, just tell us what we have to do.      HOUGHTON: I'll warn you straight out.      This won't be easy.      You'll more likely fail than succeed.      Well, let us worry about that.      He's being transferred from a county facility that's quite near to here to a state prison many, many miles away.      Once he gets there, to that second facility, you'll never lay eyes on him again.      He's gone for good.      - Careful there, son.  - It's a map.      Well, then you take it out, slow.      Now...  he's gonna be on a transfer bus.      It's like a...  it's a big car.      We know what a bus is, jackass.      Yeah.      There's gonna be a driver and a guard.      Depending on the number of prisoners, there could be a second guard.      They will be armed...  but no matter what, you cannot harm the driver or the guard.      You can't kill them.  If you do that, you're gonna bring a whole raft of new problems in on this.      Do you...  you know, want...  you want to write this down?      We'll remember it.  Go on.      Here.  This here's where we are.      This is County Route   .      It's about five mile west of here.      There's a long, desolate stretch here, and then a hairpin turn.      - Mm-hmm.  - That bus is gonna have to slow down to take that turn.      They're figuring to be there this afternoon, and the sheriff's department is gonna have their hands full with a parade.      What if it's all lies?      What if it's not?      Why are you helping us?      Because what happened to him is wrong...      and I was a part of it.      Okay, well, it sounds like you got more to tell.      HOUGHTON: I wasn't the one that wronged him, but I put him in contact with people who...      who wanted to harm him, want to harm all of you...      and I need, need to make it right.

The man who was killed, Breece Dobbs, - he was my brother-in-law.  - I'm sorry.      I need to know the whereabouts of the man who killed him.      I found his weapon and a witness who told me...      he's a big man, long, white hair.      There's a lot of big men on this mountain, plenty of them with white hair.      You need more than that if you're gonna get your man.      Yeah, I got more than that.      I also learned he's the father of Foster Farrell VIII.      I come here, I helped you.
