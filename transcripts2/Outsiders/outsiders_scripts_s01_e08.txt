 Previously on "Outsiders"... 
 My kin was killed. I'm here to claim the body. 
 We don't got no unidentified bodies on premises right now. 
 I don't know what your game is, but that was my cousin Tice. 
 We will be doing a full investigation. 
 Wade, I know you're lying to me. 
 It was an accident. I have a little boy. 
 Uhh! 
 That mountain's gonna come for you, just like it did your daddy. 
 You come near my sister again, I'll kill you. 
 I don't know who... 
 Sally-Ann! 
 Why is he at the door then?! Why... 
 [Screams] 
 Hey! 
 No, James! James, leave him alone! 
 Leave him alone - Get off me! 
 [Bottle shatters] 
 Sally-Ann! 
 Miss Grimes. 
 Just feels real weird, sittin' in this office, gettin' paid for nothing. 
 Hey, where my boy? 
 Tice, he never gone on a run before. 
 Maybe he's lost. 
 He ain't lost. He's... he's dead. 
 Everything you do just digs us deeper. 
 Take him to the box! Do it now! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 One of us betrayed me, who has other ideas about things. 
 What did you do? 
 Did what you asked. 
 I made one call to the gun shop, G'win. 
 You care about this family. 
 Yeah. 
 So I need you to do something for me. 
 I got no one else to go to. 
 We'll get you outta here. 
 Don't worry. 
 This family needs a leader who sees, who's ready to fight. 
 The Bren'in is dead. 
 Then kneel before your king.

 Very nice. 
 Why, thank you, Foster. 
 Thought you'd be up at the grave already. 
 Asa, my friend, we gotta have us a little talk. 
 About? 
 Oh, about you leaving, sad to say... For good this time. 
 Did I do something to displease you? 
 Oh, no, no. No. Look, this ain't personal. 
 This about the future of the clan. 
 I'm leader now. 
 I gotta be thinking about the safety of our people every minute, every day. 
 You were down there too long with them. 
 You're infected. 
 And that infection, it's just gonna spread. 
 And I can't let that happen. 
 I'd like to pay my respects to my Bren'in, if that's okay with you. 
 Your Bren'in is standing right here. 
 So you show your respect by doing what he tells you. 
 Walk away. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Oh. 
 Is this how you gonna lead, Foster? 
 Over the barrel of a gun? 
 No, not  a  gun. 
 Guns. 
 Many as I can get my hands on. 
 There's only one way to deal with some people... 
 Fire. 
 And which people are those, Foster? 
 The folks down there or the ones up here? 
 Like I said, you're a clever boy. 
 So you take care of yourself. 
 And don't ever show your face up here ever again.

 I just wanna open it up to the room, hear people's ideas and thoughts on how that might happen. 
 Hey, Breece, how about we take up a collection, go buy us a nuke, and blast them off that hill?

 Okay, okay. That's all... 
 I just wanna make sure we're all on the same page because lot of opinions going around, and I just wanna make sure...

 [Owl hooting] 
 Why do you think I consented to marry you? 
 Because I believe that you have the promise to lead fairly and wisely. 
 But you have to calm yourself, be measured in your thoughts and your deeds. 
 You treat people right, they'll stop questioning you. 
 Trust me on that. 
 I will. I'll trust you... 
 Once  you  earn it. 
 Where was you two? 
 Off doin' the bear? 
 Oh, go on home, boy. 
 You don't get to tell me what to do no more, do you? 
 Foster, don't... 
 [Smacks] 
 Don't you... 
 Ohh. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 [Whispers] Hey, hey. Hey. 
 [Normal voice] I will handle this. 
 [Door bangs opens] 
 Oh, ho ho. You are making a fool of yourself. 
 You would know, now wouldn't you? 
 Sad old man chasin' a young thing like that. 
 I don't care what you think. 
 I only care what  she  thinks. 
 She's trying to wreck you. 
 Who do you think it was that let them boys know we was coming for their guns? 
 It was her. 
 It only could've been her. 
 And you think I don't know that? 
 Why the hell you think I took her for my queen? Huh? 
 Keeping her close, that's the only way of keeping her behaved. 
 Look, the world is changed, boy. 
 This is where we are now, and it ain't changin' back no matter what you do. 
 Yeah, but I could do something, couldn't I? 
 What? 
 I could change it from top to bottom, get the elders together and tell them it was you that killed Lady Ray. 
 Tell 'em the truth. What then? 
 And where were you the night she perished? 
 You know where I was. I was in chains, pretending to be you. 
 No. No. 
 Thing is, you're the one come up with the plan to kill the old bird. 
 I never would've considered such a terrible thing if it weren't for  you  bringing it up. 
 I never said that. 
 Well, you open your mouth and you tell folks that I done it, then I'll just say that  you  done it. 
 And you got nobody... 
 Nobody who can explain your whereabouts.

 Mm-hmm.

 They own that mountain, do whatever they hell they please. 
 Hell, one of them tried to screw my sister. 
 He didn't get her, did he?

 Mm-hmm. 
 I still say we blast 'em off.
