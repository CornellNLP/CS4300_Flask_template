 Evening, Foster. 
 What's the matter? You scared? You scared to die? 
 Will you be my queen, G'winveer? 
 I accept. 
 You took everything from me. 
 So finish what you started the day I was born. 
 [Clatter] 
 Foster! 
 [Grunts] 
 It's not worth it. It's not worth it. 
 What's it like up there? 
 Well, it's beautiful. 
 There's more stars than you can count. 
 I'm not sleeping down here like some homeless person. 
 Hasil Farrell? 
 Pleasure, miss. 
 I say we buy us four, five jugs of kerosene, go up there and burn their asses! 
 Yeah! Yeah! 
 Caught one of 'em. 
 On the lives of my kids, I swear you'll never see me again! 
 Guaranteed, I won't see you again. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gasps] 
 A Farrell killed Breece. 
 I'm gonna find the guy who did it. 
 We're ready. 
 You're good to me, and I love you for that. 
 Your tea's gonna get cold. 
 Is this what you were looking for? 
 This is witches' glove. You killing him, G'win? 
 [Coughing] 
 Oh, god. What the hell are you doing here? 
 I am the one returned. 
 The prophecy of lady Ray told it so. 
 You're up to something, right? You're up to something? 
 I can't figure it out. 
 I ain't up to nothing. 
 All right, now, you, your time's come to an end. 
 I warn you, be careful. 
 Because if we're caught, it could mean banishment, or even worse.

 Oh, no. No. 
 I'm worse than poorly. 
 I can't hardly raise my bones. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 It's best you stay settled in bed, then. 
 No, I can't. Can't, can't, can't. 
 No. No, I gotta get Asa dead. 
 I got dark premonitions about that devil. 
 I know, sir. I appreciate that it's late notice. 
 Honestly, it's however many men you can spare. 
 Yeah, that's great. 
 No, sir. That's... that's... That's great. 
 I'll have someone call you, but we're planning on heading up the mountain on Thursday. 
 All right. Thank you, sir. 
 Okay, that's two men from Christianville. 
 How are you doing? 
 Well, we got one from Marston's mills, one guy from miner. 
 So where's that put us now? 
 Well, with the 2 you just got, that makes... 11. 
 That's just nowhere near enough. 
 We're gonna need at least 20. 
 I mean, we just got no idea what we're walking into. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Uh... [clears throat] No, I was, uh, I was just thinking about Sheriff Weineke and, uh, your brother-in-law. 
 A lot of people aren't coming back down that mountain alive. 
 Yeah, well, I mean... 
 You're scared, and, uh, I don't blame you. 
 But someone's gotta do somethin'. 
 When we take on this job, we take on a responsibility. 
 At a time like this, if we don't do something, people gonna die.

 It's gotta be done. [Spits] 
 I'm concerned about what people will think when they see you hunting a man down like a dog. 
 I'm trying to people your relationship with your people. 
 Sounds more like you're trying to protect him. 
 Well, then you're not hearing me right. 
 I don't give a feather if cousin Asa lives or dies. 
 That's cold talk, woman.

 I have apologies to give to you. 
 For what? 
 For the man that I was, the man I become.

 [Coughing] 
 McGintuk, Shay, Farrell, welcome here to celebrate this last dawn of summer, and to honor our home, as our ancestors have done for so many years before us. 
 Summer is done. 
 The harvest comes, followed soon after by the cold, quiet, death of winter. 
 Through it all, we are sustained by our mother, our mountain. 
 So let us give her all praise and glory. 
 For life, for sustenance, for balance, we honor the mountain. 
 A-myrr waigh myrr. A-myrr waigh myrr. 
 For blessings, for riches, for your great, quiet majesty. 
 A-myrr waigh myrr. A-myrr waigh myrr. 
 For now... 
 For then... 
 For always. 
 Our land gives us great strength, but that strength alone cannot sustain us. 
 It is our strength as a community that allows us to survive. 
 Please turn now to the family members nearest to you and offer them words or gestures of fellowship and love.

 Nope, not yet. 
 Right, but you told us he'd be in custody by now. 
 Did I? Yeah, well, I was wrong. 
 Taking a little longer than we thought. 
 So you don't got him?

 No. 
 That's all we needed to know. 
 You think you done enough damage already? 
 You stay out of our way. You let us handle it.

 Is that it? 
 No. I'm not bored. 
 I just wanna take a walk. 
 Well, you can't. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause I told you there's things going on up here. 
 Look, you ain't from here. 
 Right? I gotta get a lot of folks used to the idea of a stranger being around.

 Shh. 
 I need you to get underneath that blanket and be quiet. 
 Why? 
 Just... 
 Hasil. 
 All this time, Krake, you've been telling us to trust Asa. 
 He said big Foster would never get guns. 
 Now he's got more fire than he knows what to do with. 
 Oh. He'll figure out what to do with them, believe you me. 
 How are we supposed to fight big Foster now? 
 Can we just wait for Asa, please? 
 Asa's our leader. I'm sure he'll have an answer. 
 Asa's your leader? 
 Is that true? 
 Well, it seems my premonitions were correct. 
 I thought I was your leader. 
 What was it you said, shurn? 
 "How are we supposed to fight big Foster?" 
 You heard me. 
 Asa's your leader. 
 So here you all are. 
 Your minds poisoned by Asa.

 You saved my life. 
 The fact that you done that when most people here wouldn't even look me in the eye? 
 That won't soon be forgotten, cousin. 
 All right. 
 So what do we do? 
 The way that I figure it, you got two options right now. 
 You gotta get off this mountain or die. 
 He's sick. Could be dying. 
 He's got it set in his head that he ain't going to his grave until you go to yours. 
 I thought I could beat him. 
 You know, like I was so much smarter than him. 
 Like it was gonna be so easy. 
 I had destiny on my side, right? 
 My destiny's exactly what you say it is. 
 Either I go or I die. 
 Then let's find you some safe passage off this mountain. 
 How do I know you're not gonna run straight to your father and hand me over to him? 
 Maybe you didn't hear what I said before. 
 Are you giving me up?

 And, of course, he has not done it. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 I just talked to him. 
 We can't sit on this no longer.

 It's an insult to Breece's memory. 
 Doing nothing and letting them get away with killing him?

 Ain't gonna be just the three of us. 
 Tomorrow, at 5 in the afternoon, we're gonna be meeting and head up that trail by eno white's place. 
 Could you please close the door?

 Okay, go ahead. 
 Okay, we got weapons, but we need ammo, kerosene. 
 We need money. 
 Gentlemen, what you're suggesting here is highly illegal. 
 If I was involved in any way, even if people knew I was a party to this conversation, it could be extremely damaging for my career. 
 So I am going to forget that you came here. 
 And I'm going to leave my office. 
 And I'm going to ask that you please not look in the top left-hand drawer of my desk where there's an envelope containing $1,000 in petty cash.

 Hmm? Nobody?

 We were expecting him at the meeting. 
 He never showed himself. 
 Well, that don't answer my question. [Sighs] 
 But I ain't gonna get angry and I ain't gonna yell. 
 I'm gonna give you a whole day to think on it, and then I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna ask you again.

 I ain't gonna beg you none! 
 Wouldn't help anyhow. 
 Yeah, on your knees, scoundrel. 
 Not gonna spend my last moments on this beautiful earth trying to reach the heart of a man who don't got one. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Foster, please, you ain't thinking right. 
 Don't you talk against me. 
 I am thinking clear as day. 
 [Cackling] 
 [Breathes unevenly] 
 [Continues cackling] 
 Get off me. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Huh? [Panting] 
 I'm fine. Fine. 
 Bren'in, you want us to shoot him? 
 No. 
 No, damn it. 
 I can do it. [Panting] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Foster? 
 [Cackling] 
 [Panting] 
 Foster? 
 [Cackling continues] 
 [Cackling echoes] No. [Panting] No, get him, uh... Get him back in the box. But, Bren'in... Do as I say. [Panting] [Coughing] [Panting] [Coughing] [Coughing continues] ♪ [Panting] [Continues panting] How are you doing it? How'd you get out of there leaving the ground undisturbed? Tell me. You hateful, dried-up... Whore bitch. [Mutters indistinctly] I put you in there. I put you in there. I know... I put you... I put you... Foster. I put you... Foster, Foster, what are you doing? What are you doing? [Breathing heavily] G'win. Oh, G'win. What is it? [Breathing heavily] What is it? Oh, I'm lost. I'm lost, I'm lost to this world. She's after me... after me, to join her in hell for what I done. [Continues breathing heavily] What have you done? If I speak the words... My shame will consume me. Look at me. Look at me. I'm here. I'm right here. I'm right here. G'win, G'win... I'm right here. [Whispers] You can tell me. [Normal voice] I won't judge you. [Kisses] I love you. You love me? [Breathing heavily] I killed her. [Exhales] My mother. I killed her... dead. I'm sorry. [Sniffles] [Sniffles] I forgive you. Now there's a heartwarming sight. What are you doing here? You want me dead, old man? Well, there's a lot of other people involved in that now. So why don't we just make it simple, Foster? You and me. Right here, right now. Get ready to die. Hey there, folks. What in the heck are y'all doing here? Caught y'all bird watching? We-we're just bird watching, too. You know what we're doing here, Sheriff. You ain't stopping us. I think I am, Pat. All of y'all turn around and go back home right now. [Gunshot] Hey! Hey! All right! Any one of you fire at me again, I will open up! [Sirens wail in distance] Drop your weapons now! I will unload on you! Goddamn it, you bunch of morons! You're all under arrest! Everybody put your weapons down now! Weapons down on the ground! What? You're gonna shoot me? You're gonna shoot an unarmed man? You fear me that much, Foster? Really? This ain't right. He's... he's not well. Ah... I could be... [Gun thuds] ...half-hour dead, and I'd still kill you. Guess we'll find out in half an hour. [Both grunting] [Grunting continues] [Panting] [Grunting continues] [Breathing heavily] Go ahead. Finish me. As you wish. [Gunshot] [Panting] No. Let him be. He's dead. No, he don't belong here. Help me, G'win. Okay. [Panting] [Grunting] [Panting] ♪ It's done. Everything will be better now. [Birds chirping]
