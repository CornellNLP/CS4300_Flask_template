 Previously on  Outsiders... 
 He's awake! 
 I ran? 
 Like a bat out of hell, Wade. 
 Wade Houghton, meet Matt Meyers. 
 Matt's our new emergency manager, Wade. 
 I can't take the oak right now. 
 After what I don' to your Fa, you need to find his corpse, Foster. 
 Krake, I need the key to the prison box. 
 It's gone, the key. 
 Are you forgiving him? 
 Or are you thinking something more dire will be his fate? 
 (train whistle blows) 
 I'm ready now, to take the oak. 
 Just looking for somebody. I'm looking for my Fa. 
 If he's still alive, they'd have taken him to the hospital. 
 I'm headed that way if you want a ride. 
 You know you've got a wild animal in your truck? 
 (crowd shouting) 
 Get down. Get down. Hands behind your head. 
 Houghton : You know who this is? 
 Shot by Foster Farrell the VI. 
 Telling me the truth? 
 I've never told a lie in all my life. 
 Fults :  So, we should release him then? 
 We've got five guys out there We're keeping him here. Hobo Gerry : Hey there, you. You hungry? (woman singing in Old Tongue) (country blues music plays) ♪ The dawn is up ♪ 
♪ There's fire on the mountain ♪ 
♪ They'll have to answer for their crooked claim ♪ 
♪ The hollows they'll surround them ♪ 
♪ And they'll go running back ♪ 
♪ To the wretched realm they came ♪ 
♪ Nor will ♪ 
♪ The dogs of hell refrain ♪ 
♪ And the land will suffer those who came ♪ Meyers :  In a nutshell, we want to let this situation cool down. We want the law-abiding people of Blackburg to feel safe in their beds at night. So, no more Farrells coming down here disturbing the peace, causing trouble, period. Right? Yeah? First off, we block access to the town. I propose we close the logging roads here and here. Roads we can't close, we post guards. Posts will be here, here and here, and we're also going to fence off mountain trails we know the Farrells use. You're going to block off the mountain? If we can, yes. Wade : I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, I have a question. We have no money for a medical clinic, but you got, like, a jillion dollars to spend on a 20-mile fence around Shay Mountain? Why don't we sidebar that? All right, Sheriff? We're also going to add an extra layer of protection in town, post armed guards at places the Farrells have raided. You-You know what? This has got to be, like, the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my entire life. You're talking about armed guards, like, standing around in Blackburg. It's going to make people pretty nervous, don't you think? I don't think they'll feel that way at all, Sheriff. I think they'll be tickled pink we're making them feel safe. Well put, Ms. Grimes. I don't know who invited you here, anyway. Okay, I've requisitioned some K-rails. We should have crews ready to go as early as EOW. I tell you, I am very happy to have an emergency manager here in Blackburg. It is the best thing that could have happened. And what do you have to say about the fact that there's a Farrell in custody as a suspect in Breece Dobbs' shooting? He was a One Planet employee, correct? Well, that's great news for the One Planet family. Now we're all hoping to see justice get done. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm G'Winveer, the Bren'in. Who speaks for you? I do. I am Moregon, and we are the Kinnah. We come from the shadow side of this mountain. The water has gone dark, tainted by the lowlanders' road building. We've been searching for shelter. We beseech you. Grant us the welcome guaranteed by the old law of Brehon... to rest and to regain our strength. Our lives are in your hands. Torr thee sah-myrr o'Farrells? We will follow your customs, yes. Fetch water for our guests. Let's let them be. Go on now. Go on. Cousin Willem :  There's no time for strangers. They're not strangers. Huh? They're the Kinnah. Kinnah? Aye. They were McGintucks once, but they departed and formed their own clan. They left? How long ago? No one knows, A hundred years, maybe more. Well, they don't belong here. Where's their men, I'd like to ask? That's a good question. This is no time for interlopers around here. Do y'all have no compassion? Are we no better than them down below? We live by letting live. (dog barking) Man (distantly) : Hey, something smells good. What's for dinner? Woman : Pot roast. Oh, you're awake. Where am I? You're in my house, darling. Found you in the middle of the road. Looked like you was a pile of old coonskins. I couldn't leave you there. Wouldn't be Christian. Oh, I ain't introduced myself. Name's Corinne. What's yourn? How long I been here? A day, two, maybe three. Oh, no, best we take a look at you. Marlon, he's my eldest, he tends the hogs, so he did a real good job... Uh-huh. ...getting that lead out you. He's a good boy, not like this one here. No, that's not for you. That's for our guest. Now get. (Corinne sighs) (Corinne chuckles) Here now, you need to get your strength up. Boomer stew, we call it. (chuckles) It's real good. (Big Foster groans) I need to... I need to get to my home. No. (groans) You don't have your strength up yet. I'll come back, see when you's ready to put something in your stomach. Oh no, wait, wait. Hey. No... No, no, now, don't wile yourself. There's no place for you to go and nothing for you to do but rest. No, but hey... We'll talk soon. No, hey, hey. Hey! (groans) Oh, no. Female Detective (on monitor) : So, you shot him? How many times was it? Now, why aren't you listening to me? I told you I didn't shoot this man. Come on, Mr. Farrell. You know you did, and we know you did, so just tell us how it went down. I didn't shoot nobody. We already know what happened. Okay, you help yourself if you talk to us. Tell us what you did with the gun. What gun? The one you used to kill Breece Dobbs. I didn't have no gun. I did not even shoot that man. I told you who did. You got scared, so you shot him. Okay, I get that. I might have done the same thing. Well, good for you. I didn't shoot nobody. Where's Wade Houghton? Female Detective : He's not here right now. You're not helping us to help you here, my friend. I know the judge and he'll go easy on you, get you out of here, but only if you help us. Is this what y'all do all the time, just lock somebody in a room and don't listen to a damn thing they say? Is that what happens down here? Take us through it again. (indistinct conversation) We're getting there. Well, yeah. I didn't hear anything to support the idea that he killed a person. It's a process. Takes time, Sheriff. Yeah, we've got enough to charge him. I'm sorry. I mean, he's sitting there telling you he didn't kill nobody. He ain't got a murder weapon. I mean, thank y'all very much for coming down. I think myself and my men will take it from here. Uh, the state police have authority on this, Wade. Excuse me? Yeah, the state's attorney brought them in, okay? Thank you so much. You bet. This, uh, goes a long way to quelling people's fears. We'll see about getting that on the docket for arraignment today. Great, nice work. Thank you. And thank you, Wade. Thank you for getting on board with this. I was worried about this Dobbs thing, but this will be good for us, and for you... your image, you know? Restore confidence... you know what I mean? (knock on door) Come. You call for me, Bren'in? Hasil, yes. When them policemen came up here, they took our peace of mind 'cause we were unawares. That can't happen again. I agree. Good. I've decided that we need a patrol. We need eyes all over this hill and I think you're the man to be set to that task. Well, you know the ways between our world and theirs, and you're strong and you're loyal. Aren't you? Like I said, you ain't got nothing to worry about. I'm here now. You, uh, you seen Lil Foster on your travels by chance? I have not. Well, you do, you tell him come see me. Yes, ma'am. (sighs) Bren'in? Yes? You trust them? Those Kinnah ladies? I mean, they say they're starving and weak, but they don't seem that way to me. They seem like they just dressed up, playing some kind of game. (chuckles) They-They do have some strange ways about them, it's true. No, I think they're fleecers, flimflammers. I think they're bilking us. Hasil, this is our way. We give freely and we can't afford more enemies. You know, you spent too much time down there. All I'm saying is, what if they're up to something else? I hear you, but they speak our language. They're family. (Hasil sighs) Good day to you, Bren'in. How are the Kinnah settling in? Well. We are grateful. We hope we won't be a bother to you much longer. Oh, not a bother. You need any help to situate yourself, you just ask. You're generous and kind. A true leader. I admit when we arrived, I was taken by how young thou were. Such a cub to be burdened with this task. (G'Win chuckles) I hadn't thought of myself as a cub in a long while, but... it's true. The Oak only passed to me recently. All the more impressive that it be so and yet you are so able. I saw you stand to your dissenters. But you be fair and you gave them an ear. (speaks Old Tongue) It's no small task to hold thy ground and not appear rigid. Questions only breed more questions, like weeds. They can choke the path you walk. Your people were wise to choose thee. Once all the heads of the mountain clans were women. The Bren'in handed from mother to daughter in an unbroken line. We moved to the far side of Shay Mountain where we could practice our way in peace. Not much can grow there, I've heard. It's a harsh way to live. It's also the right way. And as you see, we endured. So, you have no men among you? Men only cause pain... but I don't need to tell thee that. Pardon? I can see it. Plain on thy face. You know well the pain men bring. How do you maintain your number then? When it's time for such things, men are easy enough to come by. (chuckles) What are you doing here, dumbass? You've got chores to do. Get up there, go on! Hey... leave him be. (sighs) How you doing, big fella? You got your hunger up yet? Yeah? You need a little bit more care. Oh, there. Yeah, ain't that nice? Mm... that's pretty. Why you got me tied? Oh, you were thrashing from the fevers, something fierce. I was afraid you were gonna... throw yourself right out the bed. Hey, Lord, ain't you pretty. You're like socks on a rooster. Well, well, I ain't got a fever no more... so... you can loose me now. Oh, shh... I know what you need. What? (moans) Yeah, you must be hungry for something more than vittles. Oh... what are you... I got what you need. No, hey. Oh-ho. Look, uh... no, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, okay? Okay? I'm a married man. Hell, I'm married... to a monster. Now you need some love and tender care. -No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. I know I do. (footsteps approaching) Where'd you put the goddamn remote? You probably sat on it. Did you check up your ass? It ain't up my ass, bitch. Get the hell out of here. (Big Foster groans) Relax now and let me take care of you. (groans) Oh, see? You ain't even got the proper strength to be a man. No. Oh. Don't fret. I've got plenty experience working with a wet noodle. (heavy breathing, moaning) All right, we are commencing a scout. Now we can't get caught like we was, not ever again. What I reckon is that they're already out there and they're out there watching. Each man's going to survey a stretch of woods. Now we want to know where they are without them knowing nothing about us, so we are gonna go quiet. We walk, no bikes. Well, then... I mean, that's... that's going to take all day on foot. No vehicles. You understand me? Barnabis, I want you to take the East Creek Falls. Enoch, I want you to get eyes up on Badger Ridge. What about you? I'm going to make sure we're all shored up over on the south down by The Drop. Y'all finished, you come back to my place, you see me, tell me what you seen. All right? I got it. Good. Let's go. The Drop, it's the barest road from here. Hell, he'll be back before I've even gone halfway. Best get to it then. Oh, this is stupid. I mean, he... he's been down in that town sniffing around that Lostie girl so much, he don't even know what's what. What are you going to do? Well... sure as hell ain't going to walk all that way. That's all I know. (lock buzzes, latch clicks) I'll take you down to the courthouse. You've got a hearing. What's this? It's all right. They have to do it. Calm down, it's all right. What? It's all right. Come on. Why don't you get away from me, boy. Hey, hey, hey! Back off now! Hey! Back off! Hey, get back! Put that away, right now! Hey, calm it down. Hands off! Calm down. Stop, listen to me! Look at me now! Don't worry about him, okay? Goddamn it, this ain't about me or you anymore. This is about the law. Okay, you can get violent if you want to, but if you strike an officer, it's going to give them twice as many reasons to hold you. You got to work with me. Give me your hands. Okay, you're gonna follow me. Thank you. This is the matter of the Commonwealth of Kentucky  v. Foster Farrell the VIII. Is that correct? Yes, Your Honor. Jack Marsil for the Commonwealth. Sophia Bennett for the defense, Your Honor. And the charges are wanton endangerment in the first, assault in the first, conspiracy to commit murder, murder. Is that correct, Mr. Marcel? Yes, Your Honor. How about it, Ms. Bennett? How's your client plead? Get up. You want me to talk now? Judge : Yes, Mr. Farrell, your plea. Well, like I told this one, I didn't kill nobody. I didn't hurt nobody. I come down here to find the one who did. Mr. Farrell. You look like a reputable man. Mr. Farrell. Hold on a second. I-I was told that I... Mr. Farrell, sir. I'm not sure Ms. Bennett explained to you how all this works. I'm sorry, Your Honor. I literally got this case five minutes ago. Mr. Farrell, all I need from you is for you to tell me whether you are guilty of the crimes mentioned or not. I didn't kill nobody. Never. So, that's not guilty, then that's what I am, not guilty. Thank you. So entered. Now, to the matter of bail, Mr. Marsil. Marsil : The Commonwealth requests that the defendant be held without bail. This man, he has no ties to the community, he doesn't even have a social security number. I don't have what? Now you couple that with the fact that he is a member of the infamous Farrell clan, with intimate knowledge of mountain survival, frankly, it's a, it's a miracle we have him in custody at all. sh1t. He is the very definition of a flight risk, Your Honor. All that is, strictly speaking, true, Your Honor... but Mr. Farrell has no prior criminal record and it does not appear that the prosecution has given enough evidence in order... I think I've heard enough, Ms. Bennett. Bail is denied. (gavel bangs) 
 
 (door opens and closes) Houghton : Hey, Ledda. Hey, let's go and fix some lunch. I've been at court all morning, I ain't eaten, I'm starving. You have court for the Farrell that you caught? Where'd you hear that? I got a call. They're saying that he's the one who... Yeah, well, don't get your hopes up. It ain't as cut and dried as some folks might like. What do you mean? I mean, I don't think he killed him. In fact, I know he didn't. You know, based on what? Based on he told me and I believe him. (chuckles) I do not understand you, Wade. (laughing): You are some kind of man. Listen, I know you want to sort this out. No, you know jack and sh1t... Hey. ...and that is clear. I mean, you say that you want to solve Breece's murder and then it's right here... Listen... ...falls right into your lap, and you say no? You just toss it out in the garbage? Hey, what are you talking about? There's not any evidence. All we know about this man is he's a Farrell. What you want, to convict him on the basis of that? I don't know what to do with you. I have fought for you, for years. Wait, wait. I have fought, and you know what? Everyone's right. You are scared of them, plain and simple. Wha... hey, wait a minute here. What's this about? The other day you're saying this has nothing to do with the Farrells. No. Now you say... you're saying... No, that's not the point. It's all the coal company. Okay, no, I'm done. Flipping and flopping all over the place. You hear me? I am done defending you. Just... let them say what they like. (kicks door) (Big Foster groans) (overlapping argument) Man : I need my pipe! Corinne : I don't care what you need. What about what I need? You're never here. Man : You don't need sh1t, woman. Corinne : Oh, I don't need sh1t? (overlapping argument) (Corinne shouts) (grunts) Corinne : Sit down on the goddamn couch! Man : I ain't sitting nowhere! I need my pipe! (door bangs shut) (groans) Hi. You, uh... want some of these? Some of those right there? Not gonna hurt you. Come on, take them. (breathing heavily) There you go. You ain't going to tell my mama? No. I ain't going to tell no one. Promise. Go on. Now you just... you go back over there and stay over there, okay? You just keep quiet. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. (groans) (lighter flicks, man inhales) (grunts) Hey, you're not supposed to...! Get back here, you! (Big Foster grunts) (groans) I got him good, Pa. Bren'in, there's a situation at Big Foster's place. Hey, what is going on? Stop. I said stop. Ayn sah-wyl. Bren'in, what's the matter? What is going on? Th-This house belongs to... To your former husband. Yes. Y-You have no right to ransack it. We were told that your man had passed and no soul dwelled here. (G'Win stammers) No... the house is empty, yes, but... Oh... I see. You've not finished the grieving of your terrible loss. I'm sorry. We meant no offense by it. We will find somewhere else. No. No, you're right. Better to make it a home than let it fall to ruin. Ged badeh,  Bren'in. (engine revving) sh1t! (groans) (grunts) Oh, hell. Excuse me. (Houghton clears throat) (muttering): Yeah, check.. yeah. Hey, uh, Gardner. Hmm? Oh, hey, Wade. You got a moment to talk? Yeah, sure. Uh, what can I do you for? (indistinct conversation) Say, if I see a person, and, uh, they're not getting even like a... a half-decent representation. Is this a friend or relation? Uh, it's a... it's a professional acquaintance. Uh-huh, criminal case then? Uh, yeah, a criminal case. So, I s-see this happening. I mean, uh, what are, what are my options? Well, you... you talk to this person, try to convince them to hire a better lawyer? You want me to keep talking to you? Yeah. Uh... um... uh, like, I mean, they-they ain't got no money. Oh, a P.D.? Yeah. Got a public defender, right. How's the case against this person? It's thin. I mean, it's real thin. It's pretty much just guilt by association. Well... then you just hope it gets tossed out before trial or dismissed during. Just let the system take care of it. Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's the thing, Dan. I mean, I just thought... I mean, um, would-would you consider, like, uh, taking on a case like that? I mean, just out of a sense of justice, you know? You're the best lawyer around and, uh... I've got to give you credit, Wade. You told me you loved me before you tried to stick it in. I don't know about that, but, um... I... mean, I think this man deserves a proper defense. I assume we're talking about that Farrell. Man, why do you care? I mean, why do you want to get mixed up with all that? It's the right thing to do. Yeah, if you say so, but it's not the smart thing. That case, in this town, that guy's going away. And I've been around long enough to know not to stand in front of a freight train like that. And neither should you. Look what you've done to yourself. It's a crying shame. You're not such a big man now, are you? What if I shot you in the face with your own gun? Huh? You like that? That's mine, boy! I found it! Corinne : That's enough. (overlapping arguing) Shut it! (sighs) Took you into my home, bent over backward to make you feel good... and look at you. You ain't even the least bit thankful for how good I've been to you. This doesn't mean that I'm going to give up on you, no sir. I've got big plans for you. I'm going to teach you graciousness if it's the last thing I do, I will. Again. No. You're gonna need every inch of the love and kindness we're gonna give you. Stitch him up. (grunting, breathing heavily) That's it. Another stitch. Bren'in, a moment? Of course. I know it's a ways off, but I'm worried about the coming winter, Bren'in. Every prognostication indicates it'll be a long one and hard. I'm not sure how precisely we'll be able to feed any extra mouths. The Kinnah, you mean? So, you're questioning my decision, the decision of your Bren'in to allow them to stay. Is that what you're wasting all your wind on? I just wanted to bring the fact to your attention. Fine, you have. There are stories about them passed down. Some say they're thieves. You've seen what they done at Big Foster's place. It don't make none of those stories true. The Kinnah ain't strangers. They're clan. You'll see for yourself at the  ceilidh  tonight. A  ceilidh? They ain't got but what they carried in on their backs, so we'll share with them what's ours. A gifting. Hasil : You took wheels. Goddamn it, I told you. I was only wanting to go faster, get more done like. Where is he? Now it's bad enough you could have been seen, but you might have broken a piece of gear we sorely need. Yeah, well, I said I was sorry. Sorry is not what we need right now, brother. What we need is to step up and protect this family because it's the only one we've got. You got me? Damn, man. sh1t. (lock buzzes, latch clicks) I'll take you up to county now while you wait on your trial. Arms above your head. What do we look like to you, when y'all came up our mountain? We look like animals and vermin, evil spirits, what? Tell you the truth... ...I don't remember anything. Hands at your waist. We could have killed every single one of y'all... ...but we didn't... because y'all are kin, like human beings. We got laws, too. Courts and what-what do y'all call them down here, trials? We use them, but... not just to put some problem in a cage, but to heal people. All right, I'm going to do everything I can, okay? I promise you that. I believe you, Wade. But if you're lying, like you were before... ...you're going to pay for it. Okay, go. (door opens) Bren'in, can I talk to you for a minute? What is it? I thought you'd want to know. It's, uh, Asa. Bury it. Not in our grounds, halfway down the mountain. He never was one of us, not really... ...but he wasn't one of them, neither. (chains rattling) (Big Foster breathing heavily) You go outside... and you run as far as you can and don't you never come back. Okay? Go. (groans) Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? Look, if this is about earlier, can we just... No, it's, uh, something... I found that in the mail. Why are they sending that to you? Um... I have cancer. I had a pain in my side and I, uh, I didn't think much of it, but I went to get it checked out. It was a couple weeks back... and they, uh, took some tests and got the results... and, uh... it's cancer. It's pancreatic cancer. (chuckles) Oh. Oh. Ah. (under breath): Wow. Yeah. Uh, are they, uh... they...? Yeah. Sure, yeah. As sure as they can be. Oh. I'm... I'm sorry, Wade. I-I'm sorry. There just hasn't been a good time to tell you... or anyone. Yeah. But now... now I guess you know. Yeah. Hey, kids, come downstairs, supper's almost ready! (birds chirping) Man (on Tv) : Hey, what's going on here? (flies buzzing) Why aren't you preparing? What's the big idea? Woman (on Tv) : The idea is coming into this flat without... Man (on Tv) : Look, sister, this is an alert. So, let's deal with it... (TV continues playing faintly) (birds chirping) Guard : Opening. (lock buzzes, latch clicks) (lock buzzes) They're here. We'll set him in place. (lock buzzes, latch clicks) (breathes shakily) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music playing) Blessings for you. Here you are. (indistinct conversation) Bren'in, the Kinnah thank you and your people for this gifting. Sah-wyl croeso thee. The moon nears a fullness. It's so beautiful from up here. We never saw it, or the stars, so clear from down in our world. A sign of great change to come, dost thou agree? How so? Your people have forgot so many of the things the mountain knows. I'm glad to be here, so in time, I may remind you. (woman shouts) (music stops, people muttering) Excuse me. Excuse me. (muttering): Where is she? Where is she? Calling a Circle. (breathing heavily) (people gasp)
