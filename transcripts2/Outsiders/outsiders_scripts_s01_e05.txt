 It seems that Deputy Houghton is under a lot of stress. 
 Oxycontin, isn't it? 
 You be sober tomorrow, because I am gonna take you by the hand and lead you up that hill. 
 This is ridiculous, the crap I gotta put up with. 
 [Click] 
 Aah! [Grunting] Damn it! sh1t! 
 Boss... 
 Uhh! Aah! 
 [Slices] 
 Ugh! 
 Them Farrells, they don't own that land they live on. 
 I just gotta wonder why we gotta play by the rules and them Farrells don't. 
 Do you love him? 
 I do. 
 [Hacking cough] 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 How long... I been away? 
 13 days. 
 Aah! 
 I know what you did. 
 It's called a drone. 
 Well, they can program these things to fly up here and take pictures. 
 Can you fix it? 
 I can, but I understand you folks, you don't deal in cash.

 No, no, don't... 
 You don't need to see the rest. 
 Well, gee, it was just gettin' good. 
 Excuse me. This is funny to you? 
 I wouldn't say funny. Revealing, more than anything. 
 Damn it, Haylie! 
 My family and my privacy has been invaded. 
 And? 
 And what are you gonna do about it? 
 It's not what we're gonna do about it, Ned. 
 It's what you're gonna do about it, which would be to grow a pair. 
 This is not a business for little girls. 
 'Cause it's not a business. It's a war. 
 But as with any war, the eventual victor's gonna take some damage along the way. 
 Your cherished privacy, for example. 
 And if that's too big of a sacrifice for you, I suggest you pull up your skirt and run along. 
 Wait a minute. You're not gonna help me? 
 This is of no interest to you? 
 Oh, I am interested. I would love to know who did this. 
 Well, it has to be the Farrells. 
 I mean, we lost the drone up there. 
 They found it and did this. 
 Yes, Ned, they're known for their technical aptitude. 
 These people sh1t outdoors. 
 You really think they'd be able to operate  that  thing without a controller? 
 I didn't think about that. 
 So then who was it? 
 I have no idea. But they're smart. 
 You don't find that so much around here. 
 Doesn't matter. I like a challenge.

 I don't know who made this coffee, but it's better when you start off with water instead of piss. 
 [Laughter] 
 It's goddamn foul. 
 I hope your woman made you something to eat. 
 There ain't hardly nothing left here but shadows. 
 She ain't gonna be my woman that much longer. 
 She gonna be my wife. 
 [Man chuckles] 
 [Murmuring] 
 Ged-gedyah. 
 What you gotta say about that? 
 Well, I say it ain't right that a man starts the day out drunk. 
 You wanna talk nonsense, you go tell the trees. 
 [Scattered laughs] Go on, laugh it up. 
 Y'all gonna see me running the gauntlet on my wedding day. 
 When's this happening? 
 Don't know. Soon. 
 Uh-huh. 
 W-we got things to do, see Lady Ray and get blessings. 
 Why now? 
 How's that? 
 Well, why do you think she wants to marry up now? 
 All the years you share a bed, all the times you asked, she said no. 
 What changed? 
 Why you doing this? 
 I'm just speculatin'. 
 Why can't you give me congratulations? 
 You're the first person I come to see, and you just start twistin' it. 
 See how you feel when I stop comin' round you no more. 
 Son. Hey. Hey, son! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Come here. 
 I am proud of you, son. 
 She is a fine, fine woman. 
 You just... you treat her right, 'cause I don't wanna see you losing her to some other man.

 Um, my name is Breece Dobbs.

 She should be back soon. Would you mind waiting? 
 Sure.

 Nice uniform. 
 Oh, yeah? You like this? 
 I do. 
 It was Tom Weineke's funeral this morning. 
 I know. 
 I called Mrs. Weineke last night to pass along my condolences. 
 Such a terrible story. It's just awful. 
 Well, this is just a little something. 
 The usual... snacks, pretzels, chips. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I really enjoyed working with Tom. 
 Hopefully you and I can work together to make sure that progress continues without any further delays. 
 You could've just said that with so much less words, couldn't you? 
 I mean, like, "here's a basket of sh1t. 
 Now do what I tell you." 
 [Chuckles] 
 You have a better sense of humor than Tom did, that's for sure. 
 Yeah, I mean, I think it was you who killed him, when all is said and done. 
 You and your bosses. You drove him up that mountain. 
 You pushed and you provoked him till it cost him his life. 
 Well, I obviously shouldn't have come today. 
 It's an emotional morning, I'm sure. 
 Heard the happy news. 
 Thought perhaps you might've told me in person. 
 Maybe the last time we made love. 
 I mean, that would've been a good time. 
 Is that what was on your mind? 
 Making love? 
 Well, you know me, G'win. I'm a romantic. 
 Always have been, ever since we were first together. 
 I can't believe you're actually doing this. 
 Doing what? 
 Making a huge mistake. 
 Yeah, any woman don't wanna end up with the great Asa Farrell, of course she's making a mistake. 
 You got such a high view of yourself. 
 It's why you run off 10 years ago. 
 You're too special for this place and these people. 
 The world's bigger than this mountain, G'win. You know that. 
 You're too special for me. 
 Wake up to yourself, Asa. You're not special. 
 You're just a man. 
 Okay, I got it. 
 And I just wanna say from the bottom of my heart that I am so sorry. 
 For what? 
 For leaving, because I had no idea these were the depths to which I had screwed you up. 
 I spent the last 10 years thinking back, about how wonderful it was when our... our bodies came together. 
 And then you returned, and our bodies came together again. 
 And... [inhales deeply] 
 It wasn't that great. 
 See, Lil Foster, he pleases me so much better. 
 Okay. 
 See you again soon. 
 Maybe on your weddin' night. Hmm?

 How about I propose a little toast?

 That's a right beautiful thought. 
 [Glasses clink] 
 Ged-gedyah. 
 Ged-gedyah. Hey... How about you and me... We play us a little game? Oh, forgive me, Foster, but I don't much relish the thought of doing anything with you that involves knives. I ain't gonna hurt you, cousin. I just wanna play. Come on then. My children, our family's traditions are clear... only death releases you from your marital obligations. Are you both in acceptance? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. But tell me now, both of you... Why do you wish to marry? Well, ma'am, I... There hasn't been a day in the last 10 years that I haven't thought about it, wanted it. She's my life. 10 year a long duration make a man wait. Why couldn't you make your agree sooner? Don't know. My mind was clouded, I guess, by... Past events. The loss of your baby? Yes, ma'am. But my mind is clear now. I look at him, and I see... A-a good, steady, caring, honest man. A man I want for my husband. [Kisses hand] Let's see... Aw. Looks like I got that round. No, look, that's my second throw. It's closest to the red. All right, I stand corrected. [Exhales sharply] Ooh. Ooh. [Inhales sharply] Oh, I better start doing some throwin' or I'll throw my breakfast. [Laughs] Okay, now that was funny. You just shut your mouth and throw, lostie. [Grunts] Ah... You, uh, you hear my boy's gettin' married? In the black, son. You take another drink. [Exhales] Yeah, that G'win. I gotta say, I always thought she'd end up with somebody else. Oh, in the black again. It's not a good round for you at all. [Chuckles] [Panting] [Glass thuds] Yeah, G'win. She knows a good man from one who ain't so good. Could you, uh, stop talking, please? I'm trying to concentrate. I ain't talkin'. I'm thinking out loud. Go on. Beat that. Yeah. Ooh. Now, uh... What you think about them gettin' married? Oh, it's none of my concern. I thought that you might have an opinion on the matter. You thought wrong. Well, looks like you won again. Why don't you fetch them knives? [Glass thuds] Sorry, cousin. Appears I had one more. All right, thanks. [Door bell jingles] Hey. What do you want? Well, I, uh... [chuckles] Wanna apologize about our... our date. I got in a little bit of trouble there. You mad? It's not the first time I've been stood up. Won't be the last. Not really sure what that means, but... Don't worry about it. Gotta get home. Come on. You ain't... you ain't gonna let me apologize? Got me a good one worked out. Had a long time to think about it. Could you just leave me alone? Why would I do that? It's not gonna work, Hasil. We're too different. What you mean? Come on, we're both people. I mean, sure, you're a woman, I'm a man. But that sort of helps the situation, don't it? Except I live in the real world, and you live up there. I'm black, and you are weird. Just go away. Look, can I at least give you this? What is it? Well... made you a present, 'cause to be honest with you, I kinda knew my apology wasn't gonna be that good. Come on, please? Careful with it. It might... [Clears throat] [Chuckles] It's a bear. You know, bears are... they're strong and they're... fierce... Just like my caring for you. It's beautiful. Well, I'm glad you like it, because it took me... Took me a  long  time to... make. What's wrong? Nothin'. You in trouble with the law? [Chuckles] Well, to be honest with you, I'm not really supposed to... Be down here. 'Cause of your people or mine? [Laughs] Both. I know a place that we can go. Foster, can I ask you a question? Ask. What the hell happened to you? When I was a kid... Well, all us kids, we looked up to you. I mean, you were funny. You were big and strong and vital. Now you're just big and drunk. Well, I'm big. And at the moment, I'm pretty darn drunk. But I'm something else. I'm something you'll never be... loyal... to my family, to our way of life. So you say whatever you like about me, all right? I don't hear your words 'cause you drifted away. And now you drifted on back. No, you ain't nothin' but a breeze, son. [Laughs] And not much more. [Exhales] Well... [Clears throat] Well, then I tell you what. This breeze... Uh-huh? Is about to kick some coal miners' ass. Oh. Come on. What? Come on, get up, you big, drunk lump. You gonna come help me? Hmm? You're gonna stop them coal boys all by yourself, you dumb sh1t?

These  butter cookies? There was... There was a second package. Just so you know, Sheriff, we had some trouble at our construction site the other night. Two of our vehicles were heavily vandalized. Okay. Come in, file a report, and I'll get onto it. Oh, no, we'll handle it. You have other things to deal with. I know how overwhelmed you are. Think you're pretty smart. What? You're pretty smart. Went to college, got your education, sitting behind your desk. You think you know me. Well, yes, I do. You think you know what's up on that mountain, too. But let me tell you something. You don't know a goddamn thing. Because if you knew what was up there, you wouldn't be chasing after it. You would be running as far as you could possibly go in the opposite direction. But you go on.
