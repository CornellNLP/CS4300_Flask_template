 GORDON:  If I can't bring you   
 to see what you're killing, maybe I'll bring   
 what you're killing to you.   
 - HOUGHTON: Goddamn it. 
- GUARD:  Anybody wants to go past   
 this point here, I got to clear it with Mr. Meyers' office.   
 They're calling all this private property.   
 (coughing)   
 HOUGHTON:  It's not too late to start treatment.   
 - You can still do that. 
- No.    
 I can't outrun this forever.    
 HOUGHTON: With things amping up, I can't protect you.    
 So I think it'd be better if you just disappear.    
 Okay.    
 - I look ridiculous. 
- SALLY-ANN (laughs): No.    
 It's just, I-I look in the mirror,    
 I just, I don't see myself.    
 That's kind of the point, isn't it?

 MEYERS:  Foster Farrell killed an inmate.   
 Broke his neck.   
 - I don't believe you. 
- Why not? Is it because you had a hunch that he was a good man?    
 Just tell us what we have to do.    
 He's being transferred from a county facility    
 that's quite near to here to a state prison    
 many, many miles away.    
 (tires screeching)    
 - Hey, let's go! 
- MEYERS:  Lucky thing they got ahold   
 of that prisoner transfer schedule.    
 Somehow.    
 Get your goddamn hands off me.

 'Cause someday you're gonna have to tell your kids this when they're old enough. 
Okay, you ready?    
 Nobody wants to go to church. Okay?    
 God and all that stuff, none of it means anything, okay?    
 I tried it all after Andi-Rae died    
 and when your mom got sick.    
 I mean, I did crazy things to try to make her better.    
 - It didn't do nothing. 
- So I don't have to go?    
 No, you got to go to church. 
Do you know what life's about?    
 It's about making sacrifices that make other people happy.    
 And, you know, going to church makes your mom happy.    
 So, come on, keep me company.    
 We'll be miserable together.

 What kind of people would do something like this?     
 Cowards.     
 Attack us from    feet in the air     
 so they don't have to face us directly.     
 KRAKE: Bren'in!     
 Uh, sorry for the intrusion. Silas Shay's ailing,

 I didn't want to trouble you, but I never seen Silas so sick.     
 Nonsense, Eela. 
You can always call on me.     
 He were in fine fiddle yesterday, hunting frogs,     
 - and now look at him. 
- Hi there, Silas.     
 Hey, there's nothing to be frightened about.     
 I know every cure on this mountain.     
 All you have to do is let me take a look at you.     
 Can you do that?     
 That looks nasty.

 No, it's not poison ivy.

 Thank you for coming to the council.     
 As you know, the coal company have poisoned our fields.     
 Sweet Allis Spring, too.     
 Those snakes intend to starve us off the mountain.     
 I've checked the cisterns, and if we ration,     
 we should have enough to get by.     
 As for our crops, we're gonna have to clear new fields     
 and get some cold weather plants in the ground.     
 It's gonna be a tough six months,     
 - but we're gonna make it. 
- SHURN: That's it?     
 Sounds like mighty cold soup to me.     
 I hadn't finished yet. The way I see it,     
 the coal company, they have all these people working for them.     
 It's their job to get us off the mountain, but they're doing it     
 from their buildings and their helicopters...     
 they never see the real cost.     
 So I think we get one of them up here,     
 show them the harm they've caused     
 and make them face us.     
 The one in charge.     
 They ain't gonna come willingly.     
 I know. And they won't have to.     
 BIG FOSTER: Well, I'll go...     
 Bren'in.     
 Alone. And that way, no one catches trouble except me

- KRAKE: This is pure crazy.     
 - It'll bring the law back for sure. 
- G'WIN: Yeah, it might.     
 But anything could, and this clan cannot wait to see     
 - what they're gonna do next. 
- KRAKE: How are we gonna find     
 one demon in a pack of devils?     
 Hasil knows her.     
 He showed Phil'up a wad of paper once, said it was money from     
 - the lady in charge. 
- BIG FOSTER: Well, that settles it.     
 I'll take the drop, I'll get around them guards,     
 I'll find Hasil, and I'll go get that she-wolf.

 BARBARA: Hello, Foster.     
 - You lost, old man? 
- Clan's under attack,     
 and you shirked our council meeting for this?     
 - Sure looks like it. 
- I didn't raise you     
 to hide under the covers.     
 Yes, you did.     
 The way I heard it, when I was born,     
 my mother was bleeding out... where were you?     
 Off warming Callie Shay's bed, that right?     
 Your ma and I,     
 we already lost one child 'fore you.     
 When her labor pains began, I drank a jug     
 of Farrell Wine, I run off.     
 You really want to be a fool like me?     
 You made it look so damn appealing,     
 I thought I'd try it on for size.     
 Elon would not recognize you like this.     
 Well...     
 then it's a damn good thing that you got him killed.     
 Elon...     
 forgave me.

 Hey, Fa.     
 - I found it.

 SALLY-ANN:  I don't know about this, Hasil.   
 - It's not in the budget. 
- Oh, come on, it's your birthday.     
 You said this place is your favorite.     
 Now, I want you to just sit down and don't worry about a thing.

 So you really aren't gonna tell me, are you?     
 Tell you what?     
 Tried to convince myself that     
 all this disguise stuff was about fight club.     
 You know, it being illegal and all, but...     
 that man just recognized you, and you were fine with it.     
 So you're hiding for a different reason.     
 'Cause you had something to do     
 - with that prison break, didn't you? 
- I... I don't...     
 I don't know what you're talking about.     
 Don't do that. 
Not with something this big.     
 - All right, yeah, I did. 
- We need to go.     
 We need to go right now, because if some guy in a restaurant     
 can just recognize you, then it is just a matter of time before     
 a cop does. We need to go right now.     
 Sit down. Sit down.     
 We ain't going nowhere. 
What are we gonna do?     
 We gonna hide for the rest of our lives?     
 We need to keep moving forward the best we can.     
 That is, if you still want     
 to be with me after everything that I've done.

 What are you talking about? 
Visited by who?     
 Well, a-a little boy from the street.     
 Uh-huh. What, like, like, a neighborhood kid?     
 No.     
 I think it was Breece, but as a child.     
 He was on the porch and we talked.     
 Don't look at me like that. I-I know it sounds weird.     
 Yeah.     
 Sounds like you ate a whole bunch of Percocets,     
 is what it sounds like.     
 Yeah, you'd know all about that, wouldn't you?     
 Sorry.     
 I know that it was him.

 - regarding your company. 
- Go on.     
 It's between Don Foushee and the governor     
 confirming that One Planet would give him     
 a sizeable campaign contribution contingent upon the hiring     
 of Matt Meyers.     
 Well, I can tell you with absolute certainty     
 I have no knowledge of any such e-mail.     
 Really? Well, you were cc'd on it.     
 - Care to comment? 
- I would.     
 No comment.     
 Well, it ain't gonna taste like honey mead,     
 but this is the strongest medicine I got for Silas.

 Hey.     
 - Hey. 
- What are you drinking?     
 That depends.     
 You haven't returned my calls all day.     
 - Why'd you ask me here? 
- To reassure you.     
 I don't suspect you of leaking that e-mail.     
 (sighs) Thank God.     
 You know, I've been thinking about it.     
 - Mm. 
- I had to have been hacked.     
 It was probably in some coffee shop with Wi-Fi. - Mm-hmm.     
 Can I get a pinot noir if you got it, merlot if you don't.     
 Other people might think you had something to do with it,     
 but I don't want you worrying about me.     
 - Other people? 
- I just keep thinking     
 who would do something like this?     
 Trust me, Matt, if I knew that, I'd buy this whole bar a round.     
 You don't think anybody in Mountain Witness?     
 Uh, an escalation from the parade?     
 No, I don't think so.     
 - Have you seen their Web site? 
- Mm-mm.     
 - Makes Craigslist look flashy. 
- (both laugh)     
 No, I don't think they have the skill set.     
 Mm, true. But I just, I have this feeling in my gut...     
 I wonder who might be sympathetic to their cause.     
 
 
 
 I have no idea. Certainly not me.     
 Although, you did backdate Breece Dobbs's paperwork     
 so Ledda could get health insurance.     
 That seems a bit sympathetic, don't you think?     
 It's called having a heart, Matt.     
 Thanks for letting me know I'm being watched.     
 Oh, you don't have to do that.     
 Oh, I do.     
 My daddy always said,     
 if you're gonna drink with the enemy,     
 make damn sure you're the one who's paying.     
 I gave up motherhood and my marriage for this company,     
 and I will crawl over glass     
 before I let a man like you play games with me.     
 Well... (chuckles) to old friends.     
 A-Are you waiting for its permission or...?     
 I'm not much of a drinker.     
 Well, you-you certainly aren't. (laughs)     
 Well, it's better that way.     
 At least I know you're not an alcoholic.     
 Yeah.     
 You know, I have to say, I was,     
 I was really surprised that you called.     
 Oh, yeah, my-my sister thought it'd be a good idea.     
 Hmm. Just what every woman wants to hear.     
 (laughs) Oh, but either way,     
 I have been going stir-crazy up at that house,     
 so it's really nice to see a familiar face.     
 I'm surprised that you, uh, recognized me.     
 How could I not?     
 You have the same eyes.     
 We all have the same eyes, don't we?     
 You always this good at taking a compliment?     
 - Yeah, pretty much. 
- (both laugh)     
 Yeah, I know.     
 You know what else I remember?     
 I remember when you were a little boy telling me     
 that you were gonna be a policeman.     
 Look at you now, the sheriff.     
 Seems like you're doing real well for yourself.     
 Yeah, I mean, it might look that way.     
 You know, uh, I mean, I... it's funny, isn't it?     
 I mean, I think     
 when you're young, you know, you have these ideas, you know,     
 like, you got plans about what you want to do,     
 then you realize that life is really just     
 playing the hand that you were dealt.     
 Like, you know, you remember how my-my dad died?     
 Yeah, I remember.     
 And right after that, my mom died.     
 And then, you know, my wife died.     
 My brother... my brother-in-law died.     
 Now my sister's dying.     
 I'm so sorry, Wade.     
 I can't even imagine.     
 It's nobody's fault. It's just one of those things, you know.     
 I mean, I'm the last one standing, so...     
 ...maybe it's mine.     
 Will you excuse me for a moment?     
 (panting)     
 (sighs)     
 (panting)     
 (Hasil sighs)     
 BIG FOSTER: You sure she's coming?     
 We been waiting since the sun set,     
 and all I've seen is lard-ass families.     
 Mm-hmm, this is where she lives. She's got to come back sometime.     
 Don't take me wrong, but you look...     
 damn ridiculous dressed like that.     
 We can just sit here quiet. Don't need to talk.     
 You really think you can live in two worlds?     
 Well, I have to if I want to see Sally-Ann.     
 Well, she's a little something, but don't tell me     
 there ain't five Farrell women     
 just as ready to step out with you.     
 Maybe so, but ain't none of 'em gonna have my baby.     
 I want this kid to know both his parents,     
 so I got to dress the part.     
 I can't believe it.     
 You are gonna be a daddy.     
 What's it like?     
 Well...     
 I probably ain't the best one to ask,     
 but sometimes it feels like...     
 ...you'll never do anything better in your life.     
 That all your good is in them.     
 HASIL: That's her.     
 This ain't gonna take two shakes.

 Hasil?     
 Is that you?     
 Yeah, uh...     
 sorry.

 (Big Foster grunts)

 (tires screeching)     
 HOUGHTON: I have to apologize to you.     
 Uh... it's been a long day.     
 - You do not need to explain. 
- No, no, I do.     
 You know, I met Andi-Rae when I was still in high school,     
 so I-I never really been on a date before, you know,     
 so I-I didn't know what to do.     
 Crying's not generally advised, but...     
 - I-I heard that. Yeah. 
- (laughs)     
 I understand.     
 Moving on is hard.     
 This is my first date since my divorce,     
 and I nearly gonna puked driving over here, I was so nervous.     
 That's good. I mean, I'm...     
 I'm glad it wasn't just me.     
 (chuckles)     
 Well...     
 - This your car? Yeah. 
- Yeah.     
 - I got it. 
- Oh, thanks.     
 Well, you should call me.     
 You know, we could...     
 - we could have a do-over. 
- Okay.     
 I mean, hell, the way things are going with my daddy,     
 it'll probably be my turn to cry next, so...     
 Uh...     
 (quietly): Well...     
 - It was nice seeing you. 
- You, too.     
 - Okay. 
- Good night.     
 Well, hello, Wade Houghton.     
 Mm.     
 - (Haylie grunts) 
- (pounding on trunk)     
 (muffled screaming)     
 BIG FOSTER: God, she don't give up, do she?     
 Will you shut up back there?!     
 (screaming continues)     
 Hey, pull over, over here.     
 Thank you.     
 BIG FOSTER: You don't have to do this, you know.     
 Come on home. Bring your girl.     
 I'll make things right with the elders.     
 And that'll be my sorry to you.     
 How's that sound?     
 Well, it sounds like you fell down,     
 hit your head, and woke up a new man.     
 Maybe we both did.     
 Yeah.     
 Foster Farrell VI.     
 That's fair.     
 HAYLIE: Hello?     
 - (Haylie screaming) 
- (pounding on trunk)     
 All right, everybody say "strip sticks" on three.     
 One, two, three.     
 - Strip... 
- (laughter)     
 What you got for that one?     
 Lucky for me, bad for you.     
 (laughter)     
 Mm. Mm.     
 (whistles)     
 That's you. (chuckles)     
 Come on! Take it off.     
 Every time.     
 (woman giggles)     
 LIL FOSTER: Hello, Bren'in.     
 You care to join us?     
 Can I talk to you?     
 Outside?     
 What are you doing?   
 Well, up until a couple of minutes ago,     
 I guess I was in this here teepee,     
 about to get naked with beau-beautiful women.     
 I don't even know who you are right now.     
 Your kin is suffering. They need you.     
 Need me to what?     
 Need me to farm a bunch of roots that I wouldn't give to a pig?     
 Or convince them that kidnapping a coal devil,     
 bringing him up here, that's a great idea.     
 Okay, well, what in your humble opinion, Foster,     
 would be a good idea?     
 Nothing.     
 There ain't no point in fighting.     
 People down there, they got guns that they ain't afraid to use.     
 They got ways of getting in your head     
 and twisting up your insides.     
 So, in the meantime, I think that us Farrells     
 should dance, make love     
 and drink in all this beauty before it all goes to sh1t,     
 and us right along with it, how about that?     
 That's what I think.     
 I heard someone say you been having nightmares.     
 I know what that's like.     
 What happened to you in prison?     
 I killed a man.     
 I killed a man.     
 (chuckles)     
 We done here?     
 'Cause I'm done talking to you.     
 So that's it?     
 They are poisoning our children,     
 and you're not gonna fight for us?     
 Why should I?     
 Tell me one reason why I should.     
 Watching you marry my Fa taught me one thing:     
 some things just ain't worth fighting for.     
 SALLY-ANN:  "Turtles swim, and moths do fly.   
 - How many animals can you spy?" 
- (door opens)     
 Bright lizards creep,     
 and little snails crawl.     
 Living in harmony,     
 one and all.     
 I want to go back to school.     
 I was studying before I met you, and I miss it.     
 All right.     
 And I want you to stop hiding things from me.     
 All right.     
 Okay.     
 What are you doing?     
 I was reading the baby a bedtime story.     
 Mm.     
 Keep going. (chuckles)     
 I'll start over.     
 "Turtles swim, and moths do fly."     
 Which one is "turtles"?     
 SALLY-ANN: It's this word, the "T."     
 - HASIL: That's the "T"? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 - "T"? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 - There's "T." 
- That "T"?     
 There's another one. (giggles)     
 HASIL: This reading thing ain't gonna be so hard.     
 SALLY-ANN: Maybe not. (laughs)     
 Just so you know,     
 I could've called the police, but I didn't.     
 I'm a friend of the Farrells.     
 Good.     
 Let's go for a walk. Huh? Friend?     
 (Haylie screaming)     
 Get off!     
 Ow! Ow! (screaming)     
 Let go of me!     
 Help!     
 Help me!     
 Ledda, you seen my sunglasses down there?     
 (Ledda crying in distance)     
 Ledda?     
 Ledda?     
 Ledda.     
 (Ledda continues crying)     
 What is it?     
 What's the matter?     
 The hospital called.     
 Okay.     
 What they say?     
 I'm in remission.     
 What are you talking about?     
 Are you joking with me?     
 (laughs): No.     
 - How? 
- I don't know.     
 I stopped listening after they told me     
 that the cancer was going away.     
 Goddamn.     
 - What happened? 
- The medicine helped,     
 but then, in the night, he took a turn.     
 (Silas groaning)     
 I don't understand.     
 I'm sorry, Eela.     
 EELA: ♪ My boy went a-wandering ♪     
 ♪ Full of hope and pure of heart ♪     
 ♪ He drank from the sweet spring ♪

 ♪ To depart. ♪     
 I'm a woman of peace.     
 But the time for peace is over.     
 We got that coal boss coming up here.     
 And her fate will be tied to ours.     
 She will sit at our table.     
 She will eat our food.     
 And she will drink our water.     
 - Go on, go, go, go. 
- Ah!     
 - Come on. 
- Ow!     
 All right, that is it.     
 I'm not going one more step.     
 - Yes, you are. 
- No, I'm not,     
 you pathetic, deranged hippie.     
 Ow! Ow!

 (screams) Let me go!
