 Previously on "Outsiders"... 
 Aah! Damn it, Haylie! 
 My family and my privacy have been invaded. 
 This is not a business for little girls. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Aah! Damn! 
 It's a war. 
 [Explosion] 
 Whoa! 
 But as with any war, the eventual Victor's gonna take some damage along the way. 
 [Laughs] 
 Them coal boys gonna sh1t when they see what we've done. 
 Should I call the police? 
 No, they're useless. The new sheriff's an oxy freak. 
 Caleb! Caleb! 
 Wake up. Where are we? 
 It's all right. 
 Everything's fine. 
 It's not gonna work, Hasil. We're too different. 
 I mean, sure, you're a woman, I'm a man, but that sort of helps the situation, don't it? 
 Where you been, baby girl? 
 I went to Naomi's after work. 
 Was the white boy there with you? 
 You lyin' to me? 
 No, sir. 
 She ain't gonna be my woman that much longer. 
 She gonna be my wife. 
 She's a fine, fine woman. 
 I don't wanna see you losing her to some other man. 
 I want him, but he'll hurt me. 
 He'll leave again, I know it. 
 I still love him. 
 You killed my baby brother. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Gun clicks] 
 We need repeaters, automatics. 
 You think you know what's up on that mountain, but you don't know a goddamn thing. 
 'Cause if you knew, you wouldn't be chasing after it. 
 You would be running. 
 [Wind whistling] 
 Both of ya, look on me. 
 See what you done? 
 You got 'em shootin' at us like we're chickens in the pen. 
 This child be crippled. 
 That ain't nothing but a flesh wound, mother. 
 Won't likely leave a mark. 
 I'm gonna be leavin' a mark on your skull you don't stop your gum flapping. 
 I'm ashamed of both of you, going off like a couple of drunken strays. 
 We did wrong, ma'am, and we beg your forgiveness. 
 And you? 
 I agree. He done wrong. 
 If I had my strength, I'd cuff your head clean off. 
 There's two machines down there. 
 Two monsters the size of sunrise rock. 
 I turned them to junk. 
 I stopped them coal jackanapes dead solid. 
 And what do I get for my reward? A tongue lashing. 
 These young'uns, Foster, for reasons I can't figure given the end of all days, they look up to you. 
 Lord spare us, they wanna be like ya. 
 You wanna lead someday? Start leading by example. 
 Coal folks won't allow this sit. What we gonna do? 
 Fa was right. We need fire. We need to arm ourselves serious or we will be chickens in a pen, just like you said. 
 What's your call back to that? 
 My call is that we should prepare, ma'am. 
 We should be ready to fight, but the time is not now. 
 Longer I live, less I understand. 
 But this I do know... 
 You're both wrong. 
 And stay off the wine. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 All's I'm doing is asking you a question. 
 Well, it's all a part of the same thing, Wade, isn't it? 
 What is? What's a part of the same thing? 
 Caleb walking in his sleep. 
 Yeah, it's a medical condition and it runs in families. 
 Who told you that? 
 I looked it up. I looked it up, Ledda! 
 Wade, you found him miles from home in the middle of the night, talkin' to Andi-Rae. 
 I-I know, Ledda. 
 I mean, maybe this is a phase that he's going through. 
 Oh, a phase? 
 Yeah, maybe it's a phase. 
 Wade, look, I love you. 
 I love you and you're my brother, but you gotta get some help. 
 You need to get right with the drinkin' and with the pills. 
 Thank you very much for the cake. 
 Wade, listen. Wade! Listen to me! 
 Get your hand off me, Ledda. 
 No, you're gonna listen to what I have to say, Wade! 
 Get off me. 
 You are! Come on. Just... 
 [Crying] 
 [Sniffles] 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 And you get some help, or I'm taking that boy away from you.

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Good morning, you. 
 Morning. 
 Guess what I just heard. 
 Our country sheriff is your brother-in-law. 
 Is that true? 
 [Scoffs] Yes, ma'am. 
 [Laughs] I had no idea how well-connected you were. 
 My wife Ledda is his sister. 
 Well, come take a load off. 
 Why is he so uninterested in getting those people off that mountain? 
 It's like he's on their side or something. 
 Did you ever hear what happened to their daddy? 
 Well, do tell. 
 Well, back in '89, another company... Biloxi coal... 
 Tried getting the Farrells off of that land. 
 Wade and Ledda's daddy was a line boss for Biloxi. 
 And they sent him up there to try to negotiate a settlement. 
 Things went way wrong. 
 Some Farrells got shot. Two of them died. 
 And a couple days after that, Wade and Ledda's daddy got killed on his way home from work. 
 What, they shot him? 
 He got hit by lightning. 
 I'm not sure I'm seeing the connection. 
 Well, neither do I. 
 But some folks in this town, Wade being one of them, think that the Farrells... 
 What? Control the elements? 
 It was a Summer's night. 
 Folks say there wasn't a cloud in the sky. 
 Oh, lordy, this is an interesting place. 
 Ms. Grimes, I don't know what I'm doing here. 
 This feels real weird, sitting in this office, getting paid for nothing. 
 Well, you earned your pay today, Breece. 
 [Drill whirs] 
 [Doorknob rattles] 
 What part of "they tried to poison us" do you not understand? 
 Vanessa, we got lights, cameras, motion detectors. 
 We got a guard out there 24/7. 
 What would you like me to do? Quit my job? 
 Yes! 
 Or get a transfer or something. 
 If I go in there asking to be relocated, I'll look like the world's biggest wuss. 
 [Scoffs and laughs] 
 It'll be the end of my career. 
 You ever think that might be a good thing? 
 Man! That takes a load off. 
 I don't have to worry about the mortgage or, uh, car payments, health care, tuition. 
 Thanks! 
 [Dish clatters] 
 They're free. 
 The Farrells. 
 [Chuckles] What? 
 Freer than we'll ever be. 
 Maybe I should just move up there, if I can get past our armed guard. 
 [Resumes scrubbing dishes] 
 Buzz around. 
 No, it's not so, okay? 
 It's not how I like to do it. 
 What if we need to split up? 
 We ain't. 
 That ain't how it happens. 
 Yeah, but if we need to is all I'm saying because... 
 Hey, hey, hey, ooh, ooh. 
 [Conversation stops] 
 Oh, don't stop talking on our account. 
 Yeah, see, I know y'Alls are planning a party. 
 And seeing as I'm gonna be the one that has to clean up the blood afterwards, I'd like to know what the plan is. 
 Ain't no plan. 
 That's what worries me. So? 
 If things get out of hand, I can take care of it. 
 Okay. 
 [Door closes] 
 You tell her anything? 
 No. Not a word. 
 All right. Hey, check this, boys. 
 Ah. This, you ain't seen since you was a little bitty kid. 
 Oh. [Sighs] 
 My fa's. 
 Yeah, last time a coal company come after us, they had rifles, carbines, things spitting bullets like venom from a snake. 
 My fa... 
 This... 
 This is all he had. 
 They shot him in the throat. 
 I run to him, and he tried to tell me something, and the only thing to come out was blood. 
 [Exhales] 
 He wasn't just using this to send them coal folks a message. 
 He was sending a message to us, too. 
 'Cause this here? 
 This is the path to salvation. 
 And the time is now. 
 Now we gotta line our path with the most powerful fire we can get our hands on, and lots of it. 
 Big old gun shop off 22. 
 I was spying on it day 'fore last. 
 Truck pull up, a whole lot of boxes come out. 
 Took three men a long spell to get them all inside. 
 Well, good. All right. 
 Then we're gonna go down in the mornin'. 
 Two full days from now. 
 W... why are we waitin'? 
 Why not get right down there, snatch up them guns? 
 This is his first run. He's all hard for it. 
 Yeah. Well, listen, you gotta be smart, Tice. 
 Two days away, that's their churchin' day. 
 Uh... early in the morning, won't be nobody out and about. 
 You wanna ride with us, son? You gotta be thinkin'. 
 Yeah, I'll be thinkin'. You'll see. I'll be the hero. 
 [Snorts] 
 I'll bring back so many guns, y'all be calling me a mule. 
 I'm thinking that already. 
 [Laughter] 
 Hey. 
 To the memory of my fa. 
 Foster Farrell V. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [Liquid spills] 
 - Ged-gedyah. 
 Ged-gedyah. [All slurping] [Trills and whoops] [Indistinct conversations] [Siren wailing] [Tires screech, engine turns off] We talk every morning, clockwork. Two days runnin', I'm knockin' and knockin' and nothing. Lights on all night. Maybe... maybe he's done gone out of town, ma'am. He don't go out of town. This is him? 102? If he did, I'd known about it, trust me. No, they came back for him. Who's that, ma'am? A week and a half ago, he's shooting at them Farrells. They was robbing our neighbor here. Well, ma'am, we didn't hear anything about that. I got no call about that at all. Oh, well. You think we're crazy? You think we want some Farrell-brand evil voodoo raining down on us? No. I heard a shot. Oh, yeah? You heard a shot? I heard it. Mr. Nichols! And don't ask me if I drink 'cause I don't. I haven't had a drop since Bicentennial. All right, ma'am, I'm hearing you. Mr. Nichols, this is county sheriff. Now come on, get in... He's not gonna answer a knock, for crying out loud. This is county sheriff, Wade Houghton, Mr. Nicholas. Just kick it in, for crying out loud. All right, ma'am, can you stand back, please? Well, here. Now, give it a good kick. Well, now, come on. You can do better than that, for god sakes. I can do better than that. All right, ma'am. Now, but... get that door in. I'll go look around the back, all right? I'm gonna ask that you just stay here for a moment. No, I'll show you the back door 'cause you... Okay, ma'am, I don't need you to show me any back door. [Exhales sharply] [Exhales] [Breathing heavily] [Exhales] [Breathing heavily] [Continues breathing heavily] Try to be, you know, help things along. Make it move faster. Well? That's a heart attack, ma'am. Heart attack? No. Good lord, it's not a heart attack. [Door bell jingles] [Lowered voice] Hey. What's the matter? I-I do something wrong? No. Can I help you? No! Just... Please leave. What are you talkin' about? Okay, I don't have much experience with women... Down here. [Chuckles] So excuse me if I... If I seem a touch confused, but... Last time we's together, it was beautiful. It  was  beautiful. Then why you look so sad? Hasil... [Woman speaks indistinctly] [Inhales deeply] I can't see you anymore. I'm sorry. You're  sorry? You're  sorry? My family's not okay with it. Your folks? Your, uh, your parents? My brother. Who cares about your brother? My mama ran off years ago. I never knew my daddy. My brother is all I got, and he is not okay with this. Maybe I could go make his acquaintance. Hasil, please. Maybe I could talk to him. Things will get real bad for me if we are seen together. I ain't gonna let you go. Leave me alone... [Loudly] You dirty,  disgusting  hillbilly. [People murmuring] You don't mean that. [Indistinct conversations] Did you see a gunshot wound? Did you see a stab wound? Did you see anything that could've caused his death? No gunshot wound? No stab wound? Then they scared him to death is what. Yeah, you want me to write that down? "Scared to death"? Don't make fun of me. You gonna book him? Hmm? Check fingerprints? Yes, I will check for fingerprints, ma'am. I intend to. Well, now you're lying to me, 'cause they ain't even in the system. They don't got no I.D., no barcode. They run roughshod over this town with total impunity. When is somebody gonna do something about it? Ma'am, ma'am! [Clears throat] There's no evidence that anything happened to anybody here except an old man done fall down. Yeah, except for that gunshot I heard so clear. Well, maybe I call the staties on this. You call the staties, yeah. You call the staties, they're gonna refer you to me. What a piece of luck. Oh, I'm gonna remember this come election time, Sheriff. Why don't you shut up?! Old bitch! You shut your goddamn mouth. You stupid old bitch. Shut... shut up, you bitch. [Window whirs] 
 
 ♪ [Gun clicks] Hello there. What you want, man? My name is, uh, is Hasil Farrell. Farrell? Yeah, that's right. Farrell. You must be, uh, you must be Sally-Ann's brother, right? You the one looking out after her? That's a right caring thing for you to do. Why don't you get out of here before I kick your ass? No need for that. I just... I came down here. I just wanna talk to you, that's all. I wanna show you that I mean to do good. I mean to do right. That's it. Look, I... got you somethin'. [Object thuds] You come near my sister again, I'll kill you. You hear me? Damn animal. [Muffled voice] What's a Farrell doing at the door?! Why's he outside?! Why is who outside? Why you know him?! I don't know who... Sally-Ann! Why's he at the door?! Hey! Get up! No! Hey! What?! No, stop it! No, no, no! No, stop! Leave him alone. James! James, leave him alone. Get off me! Get off me! [Bottle shatters] [Gasping and breathing heavily] [Grunts] You're hurting him! [Grunts] Hasil. Hasil, Hasil, stop. Stop. Stop, stop! [Grunting] [Whack] [Panting] [Whispering] You touch her again... [Breathing heavily] And you're the one that's gonna be dead. [Panting] Sally-Ann! Sally-Ann! Sally-Ann! [Soft knock on door] I put a new lock on your door. I changed the locks on... on all them doors. Do you know... you know why? 'Cause you're a... You've been walking in your sleep. You remember where? To the bus stop. Down to the bus stop. You told me you were talking to Mom. Remember that? I miss her, Caleb. You know that? I miss her very much. Hey, least we know how you got them scratches. I fell in a bush. Mom was there to help me up. Your Mom was there, too? It might've been a dream. I don't know. Well, your Mom loved you very much. Why did she leave? Um... [sighs] She didn't leave. Caleb, she didn't leave. She was just sick. She had a sickness in her head. Come here. Okay. Sleep well. [Clicking] Are you clipping your toenails in there? No, dear. [Water running] I find the fragments. It's horrific. [Water stops running] Ned? I am not clipping my toenails. The water stopped. Just the new heater acting up. Air in the liner, something. Give it a second. No, it's still not working. I'll check it. [Door opens] [Under breath] What the... What the hell? [Switch clicking] Damn it. [Flashlight clicks] [Gun cocks] Oh. Say one word and you're dead. I said it was you Farrells behind this. She didn't believe me. Who is that? Haylie Grimes? Oh, she's a pretty little thing. Hope she never has kids, though. She'll probably eat 'em. Now let's get back to my request. I-I don't have that kind of power. Come on, Ned. Sure you do. Your One Planet's general manager of operations. You signed the contract. It's on the web site, Ned. All I need you to do is make a phone call. Tell them work stops on the road, okay? I mean, I don't think one phone call's too much to ask, is it, Ned? Especially when you got a gun pointed at your head. You break into my home. You try to poison me and my family. Oh, M.C.M.H. isn't fatal, Ned. It just stings a little. I've never had a problem with you people. Live and let live. But you... Something about you ain't right. Oh, you're smarter than you look, man. Tell you what. W... you wanna shoot me? Go ahead. Huh? Go on and do it. [Laughs] That... That was very good, Ned, that a small moment of you having some balls. But now that you're done, you're gonna go upstairs, you're gonna call the contractor. You're gonna tell 'em work stops on the road effective immediately. And if I don't? [Scoffs] Ned, there was a time when I thought living in a shack with no running water or electricity was about the lowest thing a person could be subjected to. I mean, the shame I'd feel when I walked past a house like this one, the looks I'd get from people like you. You ever have a moment where you... When you realized you'd sooner die than take another stinking breath? My guess is no, so... I win. I mean, if I see you or your guys on our mountain, I'll kill your son and I'll kill Vanessa, too. And that'd be a shame 'cause I like that name. Ball's in your court, Ned. Okay? Oh, and just one more thing. What? Love the boxers. [Clicks tongue] [Exhales] [Door closes] You were down there a long time. I checked a couple seconds ago. Still not working. That's... that's all right. Couldn't... couldn't fix it. You okay? Yeah. I'll call a plum... a plumber first thing in the morning. [Water running] Boom. Ned! [Turns off faucet] It's working! How'd you do that? [Bird calling] [Dulcimer playing] [Knock on door, music stops] Come in. [Door creaks] I found cousin Jared sleeping outside my shack. Said you needed to see me, said it was urgent. Well, I know it's late. Where you been? Oh, you know. Doing my usual good works. Where's the beloved husband-to-be? There's something going on. I need your help stopping it. [Scoffs] I can't imagine how much that pains you to say that. Asa. Big Foster is going after guns. He and a couple others, they're going down in the morning, they're gonna Rob a gun shop. [Sighs deeply] How many times did his mother drop him on his head? What... what do you want me to do about it? Well, it's happening in your world. Don't you know better than any of us what to do about it? Oh, this is gonna be some kind of reward, hmm? [Sighs] If I do stop 'em? Asa, you're not doing this for me. You're doing this for all of us. Maybe you forgot that it's not weapons that keep us safe. It's not... It's not bullets that keep us survivin' long winters. This mountain. What's the name of the gun shop? Uh, all's... all's I know is it's a... it's a-a big one off 22. H&s. All right, I'll see what I can do. [Door opens and closes] Look at you, all industrious. I went by your house. Your lovely wife told me you were here. Um, sometimes I come in on Sunday mornings. It's, uh, it's quiet. We have a lot more to do now, don't we? I got a call from Guilliame brothers, asking if I knew about laying off the road Crew starting Monday. Mm-hmm. I asked wherever they got that idea, and they said the order came from you. It's totally temporary. Uh, we just got some, um... E.P.A. issues to sort through. You want me to call 'em? Sure. Um... Let me get the... our contact over there. It's Wes Hutton. I've got it right here. And why don't  you  call Guilliame brothers, tell them we spoke, and get 'em started up again? Um, no. Excuse me? I can't. And why is that? If I tell you something, you have to promise you will not go to corporate security or the police. Why don't you tell me what's going on before I start makin' promises? It was a Farrell, broke into my house... The one that put the methylcyclo into my water tank. And? He put a gun to my head. He said he would kill my wife and child if I didn't stop that road. The Farrells seem to have a particular fascination with you, Ned. I don't know whether to be horrified or just plain jealous. That's your response? No, this is my response. We're at war. We are fighting for a billion dollars worth of coal. It's really simple, Ned. Either you want us to win the war, or you don't. He threatened my family. The only threat to your family I see right now is you. What are you talkin' about?! He... What are you saying? I should just let him shoot me? Huh? And kill my wife and child? They're all that I've got. But you wouldn't even know what I'm talking about, you cold little bitch! You're gonna be leaving us now, Ned. You enjoy the rest of your Sunday.

"If you can't cut the mustard, you could always lick the jar." I heard that in a song, I think. You know what song that is? No. I got something for that back, by the way. And some Tequila. No, thank you. Really? I thought you said you were having a bad day. I was up all night just worrying about Caleb. [Drawer opens] [Grunts] Of course, he slept like a log. [Chuckles] [Pills rattle] Mm? [Dog barking in distance] Just trying to see things a little... Bit clearly for a while. [Bottle clatters] Yeah. [Pills rattle] That's good. A new leaf.
