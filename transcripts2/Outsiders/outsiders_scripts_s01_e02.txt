 For more years than we know, we have lived as we choose to live... free.

 Ged-gedyah! 
 Well, now that the mining permit's finally gone through, we'll need them off our land. 
 I don't think you gentlemen have any idea what you're dealing with. 
 You do not wanna mess with these people. 
 10 winters, and then one day you come back. 
 This is my home. 
 Prophecy say the returned one will be Bren'in. 
 We salute your reign, mother. 
 I do not give you my staff this firstnight. 
 You're the rightful Bren'in. 
 I  am  the Bren'in. 
 [Screaming] 
 Where are your powers now? 
 He needs somebody to blame, and right now, that somebody is you.

 Elon! 
 When you come back here, only thing you brung was poison. 
 [Engines rev] 
 I never seen one of y'all before. 
 Wanna do somethin'? 
 You got any money? 
 That's the best batch of Farrell wine ever. 
 How much? 
 Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! 
 Have you been drinking? 
 [Vomits] 
 Tyler. 
 [Grunts] 
 He was drinking Moonshine from up there. 
 You mean Shay mountain? Like Farrell wine? 
 ♪ 
 He must've followed me into the kitchen, which is where I did it. 
 Like I said, I don't remember. 
 Well, what do you remember, Tyler? 
 Being at a party, dancing. 
 After that, nothing. 
 You doing any drugs? 
 You don't have to answer that. 
 I didn't do any drugs. 
 You were drinking? 
 Yes. 
 Moonshine. 
 Okay. Anything else? Some bourbon? Beer? 
 No. 
 And your friend Colin here says you, uh, had one beer, possibly two. 
 You don't remember that? 
 No. 
 So your friend says you were drinking. You can't remember. 
 It's possible you were doing drugs, too, but you forgot about that? 
 Sheriff, why don't you ask him where he got the Moonshine? 
 We both know that Moonshine doesn't make people kill people, counselor. 
 I got it from this guy always hangs out downtown. 
 Guy hangs out downtown? 
 That sounds like a drug deal to me. 
 I mean, I thought you said I didn't do any drugs. 
 Listen to me, I killed my father. 
 Okay? I killed my dad, and I loved him. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 All right. 
 I appreciate this is very hard for you, son. 
 We'll hold it there. 
 Sheriff. 
 When I stabbed him with the knife, that man, he wasn't my dad. 
 I remember it now. I-I can see him there in the kitchen. 
 He was all burnt up. 
 Well, I mean, if it wasn't your dad, then who was it? 
 The devil.

 [Phones ringing in distance, door closes] 
 Ah, hell, he's lying.

 How are you, Foster? 
 Ah, not that good. 
 My son is dead, and my mother's sick, all 'cause you came back. 
 Now get out of here 'fore I cut you. 
 I'm sorry about your son, cousin, I am. 
 But I did my time, and I'm a part of this family now. 
 Hmm.

 He was gonna kill me. At least I think so. 
 What you want, Asa? 
 [Clears throat] 
 This place yours? You a healer now? 
 I asked you a question. 
 I just wanna talk, is all. 
 To who? 
 To my first cousin's uncle's cousin's niece, if I remember right. 
 Asa Farrell. 
 Foster. 
 Can I help you with something? 
 Look, I just want you to know I got no quarrel with you or your fa. 
 Who said you did? 
 Yes and no, no and yes. Got it.

 So what? 
 So what? 
 We're free, Foster, but that don't mean we don't got rules. 
 Fa can't just do whatever he wants without lady Ray's say-so. 
 Yeah, but she's dreaming her way out. 
 So call a circle then. 
 Like a right Bren'in would. Show your fa how to do it. 
 Why are you getting so worked up about all this? 
 'Cause I want him gone as much as you do. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Thud] 
 But you're the Bren'in now, ain't you? 
 Then why you wasting my goddamn time with this? 
 'Cause folks is wanting him gone, like I said. 
 But they want you to do it right. 
 Call a circle, and ain't gotta worry 'bout it no more. 
 He's gone forever. 
 This her idea? 
 'Cause she ain't even your wife. 
 She ain't got nothing to do with it. 
 It's already taken care of. I already talked to 'em. 
 You talked to who? 
 Elders. 
 They gonna be there at noon. 
 They need to hear from you out of your mouth, the way it should be, fa. 
 I don't need to do any of that. 
 I'm a Bren'in.

 I hereby call this  cylch  on behalf of my fa, Foster Farrell the 6th. 
 [Conversations continue] 
 [Shouts in native language] 
 [Conversations stop] 
 Obaith deid-myrr. Sah-orleh ra'clan sait th'myrr. 
 May the gods bless this family and our land. 
 My dear mother... 
 I was with her when she fell to sickness. 
 I was holding her dear old hand. 
 And she told me that her illnesses made her afeared of passing the oak that firstnight. 
 And then she called me by my right name... 
 Bren'in. 
 [Murmuring] 
 Now I know that you all have heard me say that them old powers be foolheaded talk. 
 But when she spoke to me, she say from the back of her mind she seen that demon, and he be with us now in the flesh. 
 And his name... 
 Is Asa Farrell. 
 [Murmuring] 
 So I plead you, on behalf of us all, that this one be banished forever on. 
 He don't belong here! 
 Right! 
 [Stomping] 
 Ged-gedyah. 
 Ged-gedyah. 
 [Stomping stops] 
 It's true what my cousin said. 
 My name is Asa Farrell. 
 It's also true that I wandered. 
 I left this mountain almost 10 years ago, and, yes, I was lost. 
 I robbed, I stole, I lied, I cheated, I sinned. 
 I lived in a building that was 500 feet tall. 
 I communed with so-called holy men, liars, all of them. 
 I acquired money, spent it on women and poisons. 
 See, their world is of a darkness. 
 For them, there's no respect or even tolerance for outsiders like us. 
 When they look at us, at this mountain, they don't see us and our chilluns and life as it was meant to be. 
 They don't see blooming trees and rocks and cool, clear waters. 
 What they see is millions and millions of their dollars waiting to be dug up and burnt. 
 When the lady showed me this... 
 I knew why I had gone lost among them and why I had to come home. 
 My son, my beautiful Elon, my favorite boy, was murdered on account of this traitor. 
 Not a day after, my mother took ill. 
 Now how much more of this lostie dog's back luck we need 'fore we send him away? Huh? 
 How much more? 
 Get him out of here. 
 He's nothing but a doomsayer, filling us with fear. 
 Now send him down, and do it now! 
 [Stomping resumes] 
 Foster's right. And he is the Bren'in. 
 Not yet he ain't. [Bell ringing] 
 Asa Farrell done his time according to the will of the Bren'in. 
 And so this disagreement today is a matter 'tween two kin, not us. 
 A circle cannot decide his fate. 
 You're walkin' off? 
 Then you're cowards, then, ain't you? 
 If this matter between two kin like you say, let 'em settle it like kin. 
 And how would that be, sister? 
 The old way. 
 A pitfight. 
 Men : Pitfight! 
 If this Asa falls, then he's not one of us no more. 
 But if he can stand aright against the strongest of us, then he can stay. 
 Asa Farrell, you agree to this? 
 I do. 
 [Whispering] 
 Pitfight at the quarter moon! 
 [Cheering] 
 [Cheering continues, stomping] 
 A man whose commitment to his community and his firm were just as strong as it was to his beloved family. 
 A remarkable, devoted man. 
 A friend, colleague, husband, son, and father. 
 Search me, oh, god, and know my heart. 
 See if there is any wicked way in me. 
 And lead me in the way everlasting. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 ♪ 
 Take care, okay? 
 [Car engine starts] 
 I am so, so sorry for your loss. 
 Well, thank you. 
 My name's Haylie. Haylie Grimes. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Ned. Hello, how are you? 
 I'm okay, I guess. 
 Shareholders meeting in Houston. Remember? 
 I'm so sorry for your loss. I heard he was a friend. 
 He was. 
 Ned. Have you met Haylie? 
 I'm bringing her in on community relations. 
 Ned and I go way back. 
 And despite the circumstances, it's really such an honor to be joining the team. 
 Well, we're happy to have you here. 
 Thank you. 
 So, what are our next steps? 
 Well, sir, the hearing's this week, so we'll keep a low profile. 
 Don't wanna seem like we're rushing things right now. 
 You good with that? 
 It makes a bunch of sense to me. It does. 
 But I had a thought. Maybe we keep to the schedule. 
 I grew up down the road, and this is a small town. 
 There's been a tragedy here, and people need time to mourn. 
 They don't need bad news on top of bad news. 
 What these people need isn't time to mourn, Ned. 
 It's jobs. Am I making any sense? 
 If not, you just tell me to shut up. [Chuckles] 
 So I spoke to the governor's office. 
 They are behind us 100%. 
 They want Shay mountain mined. 
 But? 
 But they won't get the state police involved, so we'll have to work with the locals for now. 
 Bottom line, it's an election year. 
 He's scared of the press. 
 Big, evil coal company taking people off their land. 
 Well, it isn't their land. It's ours. 
 Look, right or wrong, 58% of the folks in this county feel that the Farrells have a right to stay where they are. 
 People fear them, don, but, you know, on the other hand, Farrells are part of the history of this place. 
 They are legend. 
 A legend doesn't keep the lights on. 
 [Clicking] 
 [Ignition cranks] 
 Hello, sir. 
 Hi. I see you got a lot of vehicles here. 
 Why you doing this? 
 'Cause I need a vehicle for the pitfight. 
 Why you wanna kill yourself like this? 
 You know little Foster's gonna kick your ass to high heaven, don't you? [Chuckles] 
 [Ignition cranks] 
 [Clicking, cranking] 
 You know, I can't tell if you want me to stay or if you're trying to get me killed. 
 I thought you were the smart one. 
 Least you could do is help me find a vehicle for it, pitfight being your idea, after all. 
 What? You didn't make any money down there? 
 You can't just go buy one at the... what's it called? 
 Dealer? 
 Come on, G'winveer, I know I don't owe you a damn thing, but I need your help. 
 I am helping you. 
 Asa, we both know that you don't have a chance in hell of winning this thing, but losing and getting sent back down there? 
 That's better than getting your throat cut in your sleep. 
 Yeah? How the hell do you know? 
 Thank you so much for joining me. 
 I know how busy you must be. 
 But we're gonna be working together on this eviction so I thought, well, let's break some bread. 
 I've always been friends of y'all, you know that. 
 [Mouth full] Mm, I do. 
 [Normal voice] So there's one thing I wanted to mention. 
 Mm, I heard, Sheriff, that our colleague's son was sold some Moonshine from the Farrell clan. 
 Did you know that young man was number two in his class? 
 It is just so, so sad. 
 Farrell wine, I think they called it. 
 I can't really discuss that. 
 Oh, no. Of course not. I just thought you might wanna know in terms of what it might mean regarding public perception. 
 Perception of... 
 You. 
 Throwing those people off that mountain's not gonna win you any popularity contests. 
 [Chuckles] I'm aware of that. 
 Now what if there was something else in that jug? 
 Such as? 
 PCP? Methamphetamine? 
 Maybe the Farrells are cooking something nasty up there. 
 And if that were true, not too many folks around here would oppose your eviction of them... or, for that matter, your reelection. 
 [Sighs] Sundry apologies, cousin. 
 For what? 
 Never could play the piano. 
 I confess to be the one told Foster two jars gone light. 
 Never thought he'd go pure crazy on you like that. 
 You just wait till his ma passes on, you wanna see pure crazy. 
 Let me see it. 
 It's fine. 
 I can scent the suppuration from here, Hasil.

 You need medicine. 
 We all do. 
 They gave me some already. 
 Not that kind.

 Wade, I've been thinking. 
 Well, that's your first mistake, boss. 
 That kid said he was drinking that Moonshine, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I think we gotta look into that. 
 I mean, what... what do you mean? 
 Like a "selling alcohol to a minor" type of thing? 
 I mean, we got bigger fish to fry. 
 Where were you this morning? 
 Uh, Caleb was sick. He was off color. 
 I didn't know if I should take him to school, but he's all right. 
 Maybe they put drugs in that wine. 
 You ever thought of that? 
 Maybe they's up to something we ought to be more aware of. 
 Like what, Sheriff? 
 I mean, all they're making... wake up, Wade. Goddamn it. 
 I need you to find me that 'shine he drunk. 
 That's what I need right now. 
 We clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Greetings, cousin. 
 I didn't mean to cause undo surprise. 
 What can I do for you? 
 I'm Craigin O'Farrell. 
 I knew your parents before they passed. 
 Supplied them with their wine from time to time. 
 Krake, yes. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 There's something I'd like to show you.

 I am, I suppose, a man of science. 
 I don't know from prophecy and demons and so on.

 We need you with us.

 And you go at him with this. And he does the same. 
 Now the first one to fall off, touch the ground, loses. 
 Anything else? Any rules?

 Maybe you best let your cousin take a shot at this, son. 
 What you saying? This here's my fight. 
 You slowed down since I last saw. 
 Maybe it's time to step aside, let someone else in. 
 He's the best there is, uncle Foster. 
 Go on, get on down from there. You heard me. 
 Give him the stick, boy.

 Hello, there. 
 No, I'm not trying to frighten you. 
 My name's Hasil. It's Hasil Farrell. 
 Now I know I'm not supposed to be down here, but I just walked half a day down the mountain to see you. 
 Wanna know something else that's interesting? 
 No. 
 Since the last time I seen you, I got me a job. 
 Great. 
 It's the truth. 
 A job doing what? 
 Sa... sales? I think they call it. 
 You know, the problem is, after I got paid, I was... i was robbed, so all I got left is this. 
 [Laughs] What were you sellin'? 
 Little of this, a little of that. 
 What happened to your car, Sally-Ann? 
 It's not mine. It's my brother's. 
 Oh, yeah? So you walkin' then? 
 Where you goin'? 
 Out that way. 
 That way? 
 You going up over the bridge? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, you mean, coon Holler? 
 That is not nice. 
 Why not? Isn't that what it's called? 
 "Coon Holler"? 
 People don't call it that anymore, for your information. 
 At least nice people don't. 
 Why? 
 "Coon's" not a nice word, okay? 
 Be like if I called you a dumb redneck or something. 
 Well, where do you live? Hillbilly Holler? Hickville? 
 See what I mean? 
 You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you? 
 [Carrot snaps] 
 So you never did answer my question, Sally-Ann. 
 What question is that? 
 You got a boyfriend? 
 Maybe a husband? 
 [Laughs] 
 I never even, like, been on a date. 
 Okay, and what does that mean? 
 What's a date mean? 
 You know, like, when you go to a restaurant or something. 
 So like courtin'? 
 Yeah, courtin'. 
 Courtin', date. Okay. 
 What happened to your hand? 
 Just... Nothing. Just an accident, that's all. 
 It don't look so good. 
 Well... 
 You got doctors up there? 
 Got something like it. Yep. 
 What about schools? 
 We heard you can't read. 
 That true? 
 It's funny you should ask. Actually, I'm... I'm learning. 
 [Laughs] 
 What? What you laughing about? 
 I just realized that you probably don't even watch TV. 
 You don't even know who Katy Perry is. 
 The only thing I know about her is that she ain't half as pretty as you. 
 Well... 
 Thanks for walking me home. 
 Hey, can I take you on a date? 
 Fa. 
 What you want? 
 To talk to you. 
 'Bout? 
 'Bout the pitfight. 
 Bhradain's gonna do it. 
 He can't do it. He ain't ready. 
 A dead rat could beat that lostie. 
 Now listen. 
 I know you think I ain't got no fight in me. 
 Maybe you got good reason to believe that, too, but here it is. 
 I'm your only son now. 
 So I'm gonna beat that boy tomorrow, beat him good, for Elon. 
 All right. 
 You go and do it then. 
 Right. 
 But... 
 If you lose, you're not my son no more. 
 No. There weren't any drugs there. 
 Oh. 
 Are you sure? 
 Not as far as I could see. 
 [Sighs] Tyler kept trying to get everyone to, like, drink his Moonshine. 
 Were they drinkin' it? 
 I don't think so. It looked pretty disgusting. 
 Deputy, we're very, very sorry that things got so out of hand here. 
 Noted, ma'am. 
 And we wanted to reach out to that family. 
 We don't know them. Um... 
 But our lawyer advised against any contact, so, uh... 
 Well, I'm... i have everything I need here. 
 And, uh, thank you very much for obliging. 
 Well, thank you.
