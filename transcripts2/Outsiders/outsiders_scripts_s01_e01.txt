 [Motorcycle rumbles] 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 [Gasping raggedly] 
 [Gasps] 
 Sheriff's looking for you. 
 Woman : Crockett County Sheriff's Department. 
 And we got about 200 informational packets we'll be handing out, and, uh, we'll set up a jobs table at the hearing. 
 Oh, folks, this is Deputy Sheriff Wade Houghton I was telling you about. 
 It's nice to meet you, Deputy. 
 Likewise. 
 Deputy. 
 [Door closes] 
 Good to meet you, sir. 
 So, any idea when you'll post the notice, Sheriff? 
 Oh. 
 Um, what do you think our best course of action might be in terms of relocation? 
 Yeah, now that mining permit's finally gone through, we'll need them off our land now. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. I'm coming to this late, but, uh, we need who off what land? 
 The Farrells. 
 Wade here will be spearheading the eviction. 
 Of the Farrells from Shay Mountain? 
 We've got a billion-dollar investment at stake up there. 
 Not to mention hundreds of jobs for this town. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. [Chuckles] 
 Uh... [stammers] How do I say this? 
 You know that they're not like you and me. 
 That's right. We don't sleep with our sisters. 
 Well, at least I don't. [Light laughter] 
 You know them, the Farrell family? 
 Wade's family has a history with them, yeah. 
 So, when do you think you'll be able to convince them to relocate? 
 [Clicks teeth] I'd say never. 
 Pardon me? 
 To be perfectly Frank, I don't think you gentlemen have any idea what you're dealing with. 
 What he means is... well, to be perfectly Frank with you, Sheriff, half this country's electricity comes from coal, and right now they're sitting on one of the widest seams in the whole state of Kentucky, meaning we're gonna do what we came here to do irregardless. 
 Of what? 
 Of some bunch of... 
 Excuse me... 
 Retard hillbilly animals that happen to live up there. 
 [Bird squawks] 
 [Wind whistling] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Rattling, liquid bubbling] 
 Damn it! 
 [Grunting, indistinct shouting] 
 Get him, Fa! 
 All right, y'all, listen up. 
 Brothers and sisters, we're only days away from first night and the coronation of our new Bren'in. 
 [Cheering, whooping] 
 On this auspicious moment in the history of this here clan, I should say we require at least two good batches of our best wine. 
 [Sighs] 
 Only thing is, we're shy on yeast. 
 Not to worry. We gonna do a run. 
 [Cheering] 
 Hold up there, Foster. 
 You ain't the Bren'in yet. 
 We can't go down there unless lady Ray says yes. 
 You know that. 
 I'll be making the rules from now on, not my mother. 
 It's a 3-hour ride down. 
 Now, we ought to get there 'fore they close up. 
 Son, you coming? Huh? You gonna listen to her? 
 Don't worry. We'll be safe. 
 Let's go, Fa. 
 Yeah, let's go! 
 Ged-gedyah! 
 Ged-gedyah! 
 [Engines humming] 
 Fa-Fa! Fa-Fa! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I want to go on a run with you, Fa. 
 How many winters, Elon? 
 Nine. 
 I mean... Eight. 
 There's nothing good down there, nothing but poison. 
 And someday you go see for yourself, but not now. 
 Hey. 
 [Engine revving] 
 For my best son. 
 [Revving continues] 
 [  Muzak playing ] 
 [Engines humming] 
 Hello there, lady. 
 No, no, no. Don't you mind them. 
 Hey, you look at me. 
 Hey, look at me. There you go. 
 Now, what's your name? 
 What's the matter? You a wee bit shy? 
 I.. I never seen... 
 Seen what? 
 One of y'all before. 
 One of who all before? 
 [Indistinct shouting, laughter] 
 They... they... they can't just... Take stuff, right? 
 [Engine rumbling] 
 [Whirring] 
 We thank you kindly for your generosity. 
 Sally-Ann. 
 Sally-Ann. 
 Like two names rolled up into one. 
 That's a beautiful thing. 
 Say, Sally-Ann, tell me. 
 H-how do you get your hair to go like that, like it does? 
 Looks like you got a light coming off of it. 
 Are we done here? 
 [Engine revving] 
 You got a boyfriend? 
 Hasil, come on! 
 [Engine rumbling] 
 [Bird calling] 
 [Whirring] 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 [Bluegrass music playing] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Music and conversations stop] 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 What prithee said Ruckus tonight? 
 Went on a run is all, lady Ray. 
 I didn't give no order. 
 I did. 
 Batch got to be done by firstnight. 
 Had no choice. 
 You're not the Bren'in yet. 
 Good night, mother. 
 [Wheels squeaking] 
 Ah. Yeast. 
 About $85 worth. 
 And $962 in auto parts and kitchen appliances. 
 They take any guns? 
 No, no, they won't take guns. 
 They know better than to get the feds on 'em. 
 [Sighs] You want me to write it up? 
 If you don't mind, Wade. 
 Regional office requires the paperwork, but, uh, I don't want to press charges. 
 Yeah, well, man, that's up to you. 
 Ain't worth it. 
 [  Rock music playing ] 
 I got a question for you. 
 Why do we let those morons get away with sh1t like this? 
 First of all, they're not morons. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Secondly, you do not want to mess with these people. 
 Because... 
 Because I said so. 
 Listen, about 25 years ago, there was an effort to get them down. 
 What happened? 
 People died is what happened. 
 Hey there, Sheriff. 
 I was just leaving. I saw you over here. 
 Hi, Ricki. How are you doing? 
 I'm good. 
 You doing good? 
 Uh, yeah, I'm pretty good. 
 All righty then. 
 Y'all have a good night. 
 Yep. You... you, too. You have a good night. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So, y-you do believe it then? 
 You know, that they... 
 What? 
 [Spooky voice] Wooh! 
 Listen to me. 
 That whole Farrell clan... I mean, the land they're on, the whole damn thing... None of it's any good. 
 Okay? We don't go up there. 
 They ain't supposed to come down here. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Exhales heavily] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cabinet door clicks and squeaks] 
 [Faucet turns off] 
 [Vehicle approaches] 
 [Brakes squeal, engine turns off] 
 Hey, buddy. Hi. 
 You get your homework done and everything? 
 Yep. He did it. 
 You got... got lunch? 
 Yep. I made it. 
 Okay, you say goodbye to your aunt Ledda. 
 [Whispers] Bye. 
 Okay. Come on. Come on. 
 Get in the back, you. 
 You want to take that? 
 [Car door closes] 
 Thank you. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 Okay, careful, careful. Okay, give me a hug. 
 Give me a hug. Give me a hug. 
 All right, have a good day. [School bell rings] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Are you sure this is the right way? 
 We've been driving over an hour. 
 There's no right way. 
 All right. Here. 
 [Car doors open] 
 [Car door closes] 
 Heard stories about this hill since I was yea high. 
 Human snake things come out at night, she-wolves, all kinds of stuff. 
 Okay. Give me a break. 
 I know I didn't grow up around here, but that sh1t is nuts. 
 [Sighs] Okay. 
 Let's do this. 
 Here? 
 Um, don't we have to give it to them in person? 
 [Staple gun clicking] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Thunder rumbling] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Rumbling continues] 
 Let's get out of here. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 That half-lostie, the one who come back... he's a bookreader. 
 Go get him. 
 [Birds cawing] 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Grunts] 
 Lady Ray wants to see you. 
 [Grunts] [Chains rattle] 
 What's she want with him? 
 Don't know. 
 Ugh! 
 Oh, you pay your respect to the Bren'in, for she had a long reign. 
 And that ends tonight. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Now, maybe we ought to get you cleaned up 'fore you go in to see her, huh? 
 Ugh! Aah! 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chains rattling] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Door opens] 
 Ged dydd,  clan. 
 It's been a while since I spoke in the old tongue, lady Ray. 
 For 10 years, we put you out of mind, Asa boy. Sit. 
 The wildmallow, if you please. 
 10 winters, and then one day you come back. 
 Now, I asketh you why. 
 Because this is my home. 
 Mm. 
 Heard tell you went to school down there. 
 Where was that again? 
 West coast, ma'am, California. 
 California. Is it pretty there... the sea? 
 In some places. Others, not so much. 
 How long you back now? 
 Going on half a year. 
 Halfyear in a box. 
 Yes, ma'am. I want to thank... must be something else happened to you make it so worth the pain. 
 [Dish clatters] Thank you. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 It's an eviction. 
 They want us off the mountain. 
 Nothing new. 
 Well, this time it's from the state, signed by the governor, says they're gonna blow it up. 
 We at war? 
 Well, they want the coal rock for their power. 
 There's oldfather's prophecy of demons...  Reihythn ... 
 Who come for us to destroy us... and one who returns. 
 It was  Wyleth-clannin  who sent me. 
 The three? 
 Prophecy also say the returned one will be Bren'in. 
 Demon or king, Asa Farrell. 
 Which be you? 
 One more night to your chains. Then you free. 
 [Door creaks open] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Insects chirping] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 All hail to you, Foster Farrell the 6th. 
 Long live the new Bren'in! 
 [All stomp] 
 Thank you. My blessings to you all. 
 [Wheels squeaking] 
 We salute your reign, mother. 
 I do not give you my staff this firstnight. 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 But last wintersnight, 'fore all the clans, you said you would give me the oak tonight. 
 I know what I said. 
 But there be no passing of it now, not when prophecy arise. 
 The demons come from below and destroyeth our land. 
 I don't see any demons here. 
 All I see is cousins. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Crowd murmuring] 
 What says it? 
 Hasil? 
 Lil Foster? 
 Coal people... they're coming for us again. 
 Nothing to get fitful about. 
 They just... 
 No! This time, they got bombs! 
 This time, they blowing us all up, our homes, our chillun, this whole damn hill and everything on it, and not one of you would have knowed! 
 That lostie... Asa... he read you this? 
 And if he did? 
 Well, maybe he be the reason that these troubles come now, as never before we let a traveler back in. 
 And never before the Bren'in have her a child spend his days ineeb on their beer, his spirit gone, his powers nil. 
 [Wheels squeaking] 
 I want no more talk of cousin Asa Farrell. 
 He come back to us, and now he paying the price. 
 For more years than we know, we have lived as we choose to live... 
 Free, by our own rules, according to our own ways. 
 And may those devils down there know this... 
 This is our land and this is our blood, and we will never leave this mountain! 
 [Crowd cheers] 
 Bring forth the wine! 
 Firstnight of summer! 
 Ged-gedyah! 
 [Crowd cheers]

 Demons. Prophecy. 
 I been listening to that half-rat's catscat all my life. 
 It's the law, Fa. 
 You're her eldest. She has to make you the Bren'in. 
 What's right mine she promised me since I was a boy. 
 What's right mine by law I got a right to take... Any way I can. 
 What are you saying, Foster? Defy her? 
 No Farrell's ever done that before, betray the Bren'in. 
 How you think my Fa got it? 
 They say he had powers. 
 [Chuckling] Farrell magic? 
 Horseshit. 
 Only kind of powers my daddy had was in his pistols. 
 And how he perished, they also say. 
 Guns make a man weak, not strong. 
 I ain't waiting any longer. 
 She's twisted in the head. 
 Thinks that Asa boy come back and now some kind of spell at work. 
 Maybe half these fools around here believe her. 
 No. The cousins love you. 
 You're the rightful Bren'in. 
 No. I  am  the Bren'in. 
 Get it straight. 
 Long as your mother is alive, there might be some disagreement on that count. 
 Are you gonna let her talk like that? 
 What's wrong with you? 
 If I had me some guns... 
 Not that old, broke-down sh1t that we got around here... 
 It wouldn't matter what that bitch did or didn't do. 
 Yeah, well, guns are not yeast and cigarettes. 
 You can't just go on a run. 
 Is that so? 
 What's that... 
 What's that guy that you been telling us about? 
 Down Ford Lick Holler. [Chuckles] 
 Ah, he's a guard at the coal plant, got a whole house full of fire, all sorts of guns. 
 [Scoffs] 
 In all these years, no Farrell's ever killed another. 
 It's how we survive. 
 It's our way. 
 [Bird calling] 
 [Pounding] 
 Get out of here. 
 Get. Go on! 
 Ged-gedyah! 
 Pardon. I was looking for Asa Farrell. 
 You seen him? 
 He was a good-looking guy, if I remember, strong, smart, about yea high. 
 I see you haven't changed, G'win. 
 You sound skinny. 
 They giving you anything to eat? 
 I'm on a fast. 
 [Laughs] Not likely. 
 I made you some bread. 
 You hungry? 
 [Exhales] 
 Wait. Well, let me try it first. 
 I want to make sure it meets your high standards. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Mmm. 
 [Mouth full] You know, I grew this wheat myself... 
 On that little plot that we cleared together. 
 Remember? 
 You married? 
 Yes and no. 
 No and... Yes. 
 Here. 
 Why you doing this? 
 You running from somethin'? 
 Or somebody? 
 You know, I never believed them when I was a kid. 
 But what they told me is true. 
 That world down there is a prison. 
 There's no soul left to it. 
 Families have forgotten how to look after each other. 
 Nine and a half years, I still don't need to hear one more of your speeches. 
 What I need is for you to listen to me. 
 Big Foster... 
 Lady Ray say he gone sour, and I think she right. 
 But he needs somebody to blame, and right now that somebody is you. 
 Well, he knows where to find me. 
 Whatever you did down there, saw down there... 
 Must have been some kind of low. 
 
 
 
 [  Hip-hop music playing ] 
 Afternoon, gentlemen. 
 Hey, Butch. How you doing, man?

 If I see you buying around here again, you know what happens? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yes, sir, what? 
 We won't do it again, officer. 
 Okay. Hand it over. 
 Okay. Go away. 
 [Engine revs] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Lady Ray said I was going free today, but I don't think this is what she had in mind. 
 Shut up, you lostie. 
 Get off me! 
 Time to earn your keep, boy. 
 [Grunting] 
 Where we going? 
 You'll know when you get there. 
 I ain't ever going back down there, Foster. 
 You hear me? Not ever. 
 Well, you'll never be a part of this family again. 
 Up to you. You coming or not? 
 [Chuckles] Come on. Get him in there. 
 Go on.

 I don't know. Maybe get some chicken wings and some beer. 
 You got any money? 
 No. 
 So, what? We gon' rob it? 
 I don't know. 
 We could.

 Look, you're nice, but... 
 But what? 
 I don't want to go to jail.

 Oh. 
 There she is. 
 [Exhales heavily]

 And take some spoons from the kitchen. 
 You can never have enough spoons. 
 Hey. Oh.

 Go! Now!

 Now, what you got right there... 
 That's the best batch of Farrell wine ever, if I do say so myself. 
 I-I heard stories about this, but no one ever seen it before. 
 It's beautiful, man. 
 Thank you, Butch. 
 Um, me and my cousin... We, uh... we make it together. 
 I can't tell you how, though. That's a secret. 
 But we only make two batches a year, so... 
 How much? 
 $1,000 a jug. 
 [Snorts] 
 $20. 
 Moonshine's all around here, my friend. 
 This ain't Moonshine, Butch. 
 This is... this is Farrell wine. 
 I'll give you $40, plus a cut of my proceeds. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Humankind ruination. 
 That's what they told us this is. 
 Come here. I got a question. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 That a boy or a girl? 
 I guess you could say both. 
 So, are you... what do you call it? 
 You... you queer? 
 No.

 Does it matter?

 Hey, uh, my boy was out of the bambalacha. 
 I got some of that bubba kush for you. 
 No problem, Butch. 
 All right. 
 Hey. 
 You guys like to get shitfaced? 
 'Cause I got this stuff in the back of my trunk that makes a fifth of Tequila look like a can of bud light. 
 What's that? 
 Farrell wine. 
 [Keys jangle] 
 Moonshine? 
 From up the mountain? 
 No sh1t. [Car door closes] 
 See, Hasil Farrell and I are close personal friends. 
 He said he put a... Put a snake venom in this batch just out of deference to our relationship. 
 [Bottle clanks] 
 Looks awesome, but, uh, no, thanks. 
 What the hell, man? Why not? 
 Look, since you guys is in good standing, we'll call it $150. 
 $150? You're kidding me. 
 That's a good price, son. 
 I'm in. [Chuckles] 
 All right. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Don't be a wuss, Colin.

 [Crowd cheers] 
 Tyler, Tyler, come on. 
 We're gonna go home. You need to go home, Tyler. 
 Shut up, pussy! [Grunts] 
 Oh! 
 Oh, snap! 
 [Laughter]

 [Crickets chirping] 
 [Dogs barking in distance] 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 You weren't answering your phone. 
 Your mother is worried. 
 Have you been drinking? 
 Tyler, I'm talking to you. 
 [Retches] 
 What did I tell you last time you came home intoxicated? 
 Where's the car? 
 Huh? 
 Tyler. 
 [Knife plunging] 
 [Body thuds] 
 [Gasps] 
 Tyler. 
 [Gasping] Sweetie. 
 [Breathing raggedly] 
 [Knife thuds]

 Houghton. 
 [Engine turns off] 
 [Door creaks open] 
 Sheriff's department! 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 That's the coal company guy. 
 Wait. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Crying] 
 Okay. 
 Okay. [Breathing heavily] 
 So you think meth? 
 Or crack or something. 
 Tyler doesn't do those kinds of drugs. 
 Okay? I know him. He was just shitfaced. 
 Okay, well, what was he drinking? 
 Don't say anything till your parents get here, Colin, and, like, get a lawyer. 
 Okay, listen, you're not in any trouble, okay? 
 Just... I need to know what happened. 
 He was drinking Moonshine... 
 You know, from up there. 
 You mean Shay Mountain, like Farrell wine? 
 All right, well, I got your numbers here, and I got everything I need, so, uh, I'll be in contact. 
 Thank you. 
 Two jars gone. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door slams open] 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What are... hey, shut up, then! 
 No, no, no! 
 Get up. Get up. Get up! 
 My favorite son is dead 'cause you was busy thieving us. 
 I found it in a ditch on the side of the road! 
 I swear I found it! 
 [Grunts] 
 Hold him down. 
 [Grunting] 
 We got us rules. 
 Call... call the elders! [Lighter clicks] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Call a circle! 
 Thing is, they be my rules now. 
 Aah! 
 [Groaning] 
 [Sighs] Man, his own kid. 
 My god. 
 Believe that sh1t? 
 He was high? 
 Oh, I think meth, probably just some cheap dirt from a one-step. 
 He say where he got the stuff? 
 We haven't talked to the kid yet. 
 I mean, he's in the hospital... talking about hurting himself. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 I don't know, Wade. 
 I got a bad feeling the Farrells are involved. 
 This creek gone from sh1t to shittier. 
 We got to get them off that mountain. 
 What are you talking about, sir? 
 I mean, what in god's name are you talking about, get them off that mountain? 
 You think you can last a winter up there? 
 How about 200? I couldn't. 
 No money, no microwave, no convenience store. 
 I mean, there is a reason we can't get them off that mountain. 
 They know things the name of which we can't even remember. 
 They know how to stick together. 
 They are family, and the harder we try to push, the tougher they're gonna get. 
 I don't care about any of that, Wade. 
 All I know is somebody's got to move them out now, and that somebody is you.
