 Previously on "Outsiders"... 
 This mountain is ours, but it don't come free. 
 We gotta pay rent on it. 
 Only our rent, it come in blood. 
 Last time they started on that road, what happened? 
 Two of our people got shot by the police. 
 One of them was your fa. He was at Bren'in. 
 And now that the mining permit's finally gone through, we'll need them off our land. 
 Whatever it is that you think that we have up here, it's goin' away and soon. 
 What should I do? 
 Show them who we are. 
 Tonight, we'll be hearing arguments pro and con concerning the relocation of the homesteader family we call the Farrells. 
 The start date for hiring full-time positions has been pushed. 
 Pushed till when? 
 Until all those people have been moved. 
 Any of you come up that mountain, you Ain't gonna be coming back down. 
 We got a message for you. 
 [Groans] 
 Something you can take to your kin. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Laughter] 
 How'd it go down there? 
 Not too good from the looks of it. 
 What's right mine, I got a right to take. 
 [Grunts] 
 I am the one now. 
 We're in a war, G'win. 
 Looks like we're losing already. 
 ♪ 
 [Whirring overhead] 
 [Static crackles] 
 If this don't help, I'm just gonna keep you comfortable from here on out, lady. 
 I'm sorry, G'winveer. 
 I know that Bren'in isn't well, but I just didn't know where else to go. 
 What is it, clive? 
 There's demons afoot. 
 Asa. 
 [Hammering stops] 
 We got somethin' to show you. 
 My boy shot this out of the sky. 
 G'winveer said that you might know what it be. 
 Well, they can program these things to fly up here and take pictures. 
 It's called a drone. 
 Pic... pictures? 
 Of what? 
 Us. 
 Why? 
 That's the company that's gonna dynamite the mountain to get to the coal seam, same way they did all the others. 
 Maybe they're just trying to figure out how many of us are up here. 
 Maybe it's got something to do with what Foster did last night. 
 [Spits] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What do they want? 
 Well, you're looking better since your little altercation. 
 Maybe next time you'll listen to me before you go on down there. 
 Well, this is impressive. 
 You should know, stealing one backhoe is not gonna stop 'em. 
 First of all, they can't take a sh1t without some kinda machine doing it for them. 
 And second, it Ain't stealin' if it's on your land. 
 That's fine. 
 They'll just get another one and another and another. 
 And we'll just take those, too. 
 Oh, make sure you're smiling next time. 
 They sent this up to take pictures. 
 Now if the state gets proof we took from them, we give 'em reason to come at us full force, don't we? 
 Well, that sounds like jealousy to me. 
 Sounds like he knows better than to poke the bear. 
 You really want to get into who's pokin' who? 
 Hey, you didn't help none, so you don't get no pickin's. 
 [Object thuds] 
 [Laughing] 
 All right, tell us, funny man. 
 How  you  plannin' on stopping 'em? 
 Oh, I don't think you'd be interested. 
 No? And why is that? 
 'Cause it requires steps, Foster. 
 You think the Farrells stole a 10-ton backhoe? 
 Hauled it up Shay mountain. How'd they do that? 
 [Chuckles] 
 As the witty sports analysts like to say, the film don't lie. 
 Dina, can I get a, uh, I-128, please? 
 Dina? 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Telephone ringing in distance] 
 [Drawer closes]Well, you just go on. 
 Fill this one out to the best of your ability. 
 You do the top part. 
 Don't do that down there. That's us. 
 And, uh, that'll let the whole process get started. 
 [Grunts] 
 And by filling this out, that means you're gonna head on up there to retrieve our stolen property? 
 Yeah. 
 That's the first step of the process. 
 And what are the other ones? 
 Well, ma'am, I don't see nobody in those photos, much less a Farrell. 
 Deputy, if I go to bed at night and there's no snow on the ground, and I Wake up to a blanket of snow, I'm pretty damn sure it snowed. 
 Well, you fill that out. 
 File the claim, get yourself a new one. 
 And in the meanwhile, if that other one turns up, then it turns up. 
 Oh. Deputy, I feel terrible all of a sudden. 
 Why's that, ma'am? 
 Why you're under the weather, aren't you? 
 I can see it in your eyes. 
 I am so sorry to be bothering you when you're not feeling well. 
 Thank you so, so much for all your help.

 No, man, I quit. 
 I got some of these, though. 
 Got into 'em underground. 
 Want one? No, I'm good. 
 Hey, I like what you said at the hearing. 
 That sh1t was real, man. It's good stuff. 
 Sorry. No work today. 
 Probably not tomorrow either. 
 Pat... 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Lowered voice] 
 What's going on? 
 Everything's on hold 'cause of some equipment problem. 
 What does that have to do with anything? 
 Goddamn Farrells took it. 
 Took what? 
 Or hid it or something, the backhoe. 
 Get me trimming trees. 
 Hell, I'll... I'll wash the damn trucks.

 So don't be too hard on her for it. 
 As women, you know, they up and down. 
 Like winter, spring, back again. 
 But when they go through something like she did, like you both did, losing the little one, she gonna drift away. 
 She gonna make mistakes. 
 She gonna cry, then come back.

 I was just gonna grab some coffee. 
 Would you... 
 Do y'all drink coffee? 
 Black, please, if you don't mind. 
 I, uh...[clears throat] 
 I never gave it much thought when it happened elsewhere. 
 But when they announced an extraction plan at Shay mountain, our mountain, um... I don't know. 
 Thank you. 
 Everything changed. 
 I grew up in the shadow of that hill. 
 So it's like a part of me. I mean, all of us. 
 The Cherokee said it's evil. 
 They called it "blood mountain" or some such thing, that it had dark powers. 
 All I know is, it's beautiful. 
 It changes every day. 
 Do you know what a web site is? 
 Is it a dedicated site or just social media presence? 
 [Chuckles]It's a site. 
 Right. 
 Oh, wow. 
 I, uh, seen a couple of y'all a couple of times, but, uh, I've never actually spoken to one of you. 
 I know. All these years, being treated like ninth-class citizens, uh, my kin don't trust people down here very much. 
 And you? 
 How well do you know the people from the energy company? 
 Well, it's not like we're friends. 
 And the woman in the suit from the other night... 
 Who's she? 
 I don't know her. She's new. 
 And the guy that was sitting next to her with gray hair? 
 That's Ned. Ned osborn. 
 He's from around here. 
 Could I, um, could I trouble you for some more coffee? 
 It's real good. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thank you.

 They were trying to say that it was your Farrell wine that was in part...

 It will just take a second, I promise. 
 [Laughs] Coffee? 
 No, thank you. You go right ahead. 
 So, Sheriff... 
 Mm, Tom. 
 Tom, as you know, I have such respect for you and for your position in this community. 
 So I just wanted to get your feedback on a dumb little idea of mine. 
 [Coffeepot clatters] 
 Oh, I'm sure it's not dumb. 
 Well, you haven't heard it yet. 
 [Laughs] 
 So we were considering forming a little outreach committee, and it would be great if someone from law enforcement could help me to not screw it up. 
 You met Wade Houghton, right? 
 I did, and he is just great. 
 Uh, but I'm not sure he has the time either. 
 I was in here earlier today to report how the Farrells stole a $220,000 piece of construction equipment. 
 They did? 
 Mm, and it seems that Deputy Houghton is under a lot of stress. 
 And I would not want to do anything to put any extra pressure on him with his health problems and all. 
 Does he have back problems? Is that it? 
 'Cause my sister-in-law has terrible spinal issues, so I know all about it... 
 The constricted pupils, the fatigue. 
 Oxycontin, isn't it? 
 It is written all over his face, the poor guy. 
 Here's the deal. 
 I like you people. I do. 
 You got our best interest in mind.

 Oh, 100%.
