 Previously, on Bitten. 
 Roman Navikev : You have one week to deliver us proof of Malcolm's death. 
 And if I don't? 
 We'll find him for you. 
 And take control of your Pack in the process. 
 Rodrigo is here to see the repercussions of treachery. 
 This is the house that has seen much death recently. 
 I think that might include my Alpha. 
 Everything's ready. 
 Everyone is here to celebrate you, Savannah. 
 Today, you come into your power. 
 I want Savannah. Now! 
 (Explosion) 
 Elena : Savannah, he doesn't have any power over you. 
 Aleister : Show them who you trust.

 Clay : I was thinking... we should go away for a bit. 
 Just a few days, somewhere warm. 
 Get your mind off what happened. 
 (Sighing) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 What happened to me at Aleister's... 
 I hate that it took me so long to find you. 
 I thought I lost you.

 You never will.

 Roman : You call all of us back here with ceremony in your voice. 
 For this? 
 It is not enough. 
 That's proof of Malcolm's death. 
 That's all the Council needs. 
 You know that we need much more. 
 What would you say is the thing that matters to us most? 
 Our secrecy. 
 Malcolm involved humans. 
 He used serial killers to attack your Pack. 
 We are all at risk now. 
 I'm not going to justify myself to an alpha who's been in that position for, what? 
 A single week? 
 (Scoffing) 
 I don't have to justify myself to any of you. 
 How can we be sure that there are no loose ends? 
 That no one else is aware of our existence? 
 Jeremy : Because I gave you my word. 
 And that's all you need. 
 And yet your Pack fraternizes with humans. 
 Our secret remains intact. 
 Roman : As do our rules. 
 Rules that have kept us alive. 
 We need to be satisfied that you have done everything to ensure that our secrets remain so. 
 Once again, from the beginning. 
 Each step, every detail. 
 Exactly who is involved. 
 Okay, Roman. 
 As you wish. 
 (Groaning) 
 (Flames crackling) 
 (Metallic thud) 
 (Deep breath) 
 Paige : So that's the last of it? 
 Yeah. 
 Found these... symbols everywhere. 
 (Metallic thud) 
 Aleister wore one of those around his neck, didn't he? 
 I never found it. 
 Should've been on his body. 
 Which is burned and buried, it's all good. 
 Remind me to bring you along next time I've got to sanitize a witch compound. 
 We could have avoided all of this. 
 How? 
 He was my half-brother. 
 Maybe... 
 What? 
 You think you could just... hug the crazy away? 
 It's just... 
 You don't know how a family can change things for someone. 
 I can't imagine a life without a family, without my mom. 
 How about your mom? 
 I never met her. 
 You've never been curious? 
 My dad died in my arms, and his last words to me... were her name. 
 Lily. 
 Jeremy told me that she lives in Hawkesbury. 
 So I Googled her. 
 She's pretty. 
 She, uh... 
 She works in a restaurant there, and she likes line dancing. (Chuckle) 
 Why haven't you gone to see her? 
 What are the rules when someone finds out that one of you is a witch? 
 Well, it doesn't happen. 
 We're careful. Okay, well, when a human finds out that we are werewolves we have to kill them. 
 Can't risk that. So... 
 She's better off not ever meeting me. 
 Roman : Without secrecy, we are all dead. 
 Did you force Malcolm to tell you who else was involved? 
 There wasn't time. 
 Were you the one who killed him? 
 No. (Sighing) Elena did. 
 She's our best tracker, she got to him first, and she dealt with him. 
 A true Alpha doesn't let others do his dirty work for him. 
 A true leader doesn't just seek glory for himself. 
 He focuses on what was accomplished. 
 Not who accomplished it. 
 I think I've indulged you enough here, and answered your questions. 
 This conversation is over. 
 One last thing. 
 Let us meet her. 
 Elena, the one who killed Malcolm. 
 Eduardo tells me she's magnificent. 
 Clay : You sure you want to do this? 
 I owe my life to the fact that you taught me how to fight. 
 And, I don't know what's around the next corner but I want to be ready for it. 
 I want to keep training. 
 Darling, you far surpassed my training. 
 You're saying you're not up for it? 
 No, I'm saying that, uh... 
 Maybe cutting off all that hair has made you weaker. 
 (Phone buzzing) 
 Nick, what's up? 
 Hey, we're just about to head back. 
 Jeremy : (On phone)  Any problems? 
 Nope, it's all buttoned up tight. 
 Did you hear from Logan yet? 
 No, he's not answering his phone. 
 Him and Rachel just vanished. 
 How's Jeremy? 
 He's worried about him too. 
 The Alphas are back. 
 I'll let you know how it goes. 
 Nick :  Okay. We'll be back tonight. 
 Or we might overnight in Hawkesbury. 
 Where? 
 See ya. (Hanging up click) 
 What's going on with Nick and Paige? 
 Hard to tell. 
 Is it? 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 No way. We don't have to talk to your mom. 
 We can't do... 
 We can go, and we can just... take a look. 
 Have a nice dinner... (Sighing) bottle of wine... 
 Maybe we can even spend the night. 
 I think that we deserve it. 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Elena? 
 The other Alphas would like to speak with you. 
 That hair suits you. 
 (Eerie suspenseful music) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Malcolm didn't have any final words. 
 And he didn't give me an explanation But I wasn't expecting him to. 
 Because my fingers were in his throat. 
 (Deep breath) 
 She is fierce. 
 And capable. 
 Is that how she survived? 
 Elena has trained with our Pack for years. 
 Not how she survived the fight with Malcolm. 
 How did she survive her first Change? 
 Eduardo : Every pack has tried to turn a woman, none of them have ever survived. 
 You drug her? So she could handle the pain? 
 Or maybe there's something in her DNA. 
 Perhaps we could... 
 That's enough. 
 If you have any more questions about Malcolm Danvers' death you ask those. 
 Otherwise... 
 No. 
 You want to know how I survived? 
 Because of Jeremy. 
 Because of his guidance. 
 His counsel. 
 You want to learn to grow? 
 To change, to evolve? 
 Then stop talking, and start listening... 
 To him. 
 May I go?

 ♪ Lone wolf don't hunt like he used to ♪

 That's her. 
 Paige! 
 Excuse me, would it be okay if I moved tables? 
 It's just a little bit brighter by the window. 
 Lily : Yeah, not a problem. Are you alone? 
 No, my fiancé will be joining me, eventually. 
 He's your fiancé? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, come on over, I won't bite. 
 Huh... 
 Hi. 
 I'm Nick. 
 Pleased to meet you, Nick. 
 I'm Lily. 
 I'll be right back to take your order. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 When the Mutts attacked you here, how did it feel? 
 Fighting for your life, protecting your home? 
 We did what we had to do. 
 Wasn't our choice, but it was our fight. 
 What would you have done? 
 Hunted down each and every Mutt. 
 Kill them all. 
 Even those who weren't involved? 
 An iron fist. 
 It's the only way to deal with revolt. 
 Jeremy : Please, take your time, enjoy my grounds until you have to leave. 
 Well, if you'll excuse me I'm going to head back in to the others. 
 You think you float above it all. 
 Your estate, your paintings, your precious Elena. 
 Goodbye, Eduardo. 
 You killed my Alpha. 
 Here. In your house. 
 Be very, very careful what you're saying. 
 But why didn't you bring it up with the other Alphas? 
 Because you killed him impulsively. 
 Then you covered it up. 
 An accusation without proof is just a story, and you have no proof. 
 Would you like to take your little fairy tale to the Alpha Council? 
 I'd be delighted to watch you fall. 
 I have something more important than proof. 
 Your Nick Sorrentino. 
 Did you know he just arrived in a tiny town called Hawkesbury. 
 With a woman. 
 If you'd like to see him again, you will do something for me. 
 By the end of the day, you will kill Roman Navikev. 
 Do you think that I want to kill the Russian Alpha and start a war because you threatened me? 
 (Chuckling) 
 I expect you to make a choice. 
 I know Elena is with Roman now, showing him your estate. 
 If he still lives at the end of the day, then... your Nick will die. 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Get Nick on the phone. 
 (Remote phone ringing) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 (Phone buzzing) 
 (Shattering) 
 Phones go right to voice-mail. 
 Keep trying. 
 Okay, I'm going to track Nick down, keep him safe. 
 No, no, no, no, I need you here. 
 We have to trust that Nick can take care of himself. 
 What about Roman? 
 Why shouldn't we just bring this to the Alpha Council? 
 We have no proof. 
 We need to deal with Eduardo once and for all. 
 We keep Roman close for now, that'll buy us a little more time. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Hmph. Eduardo's very ambitious. 
 This is not his only plan. 
 Watch him closely, he'll tip his hand. 
 And we will use that ambition against him. 
 What if we can't? 
 We know where Eduardo and Roman are. 
 We'll make a decision. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Can't afford to be lenient if we want to keep our secret safe. 
 Elena... 
 Savannah? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I had a vision. 
 (Echoing)  We're all dead by dawn. We're all dead by dawn... 
 (Screaming) 
 We're going to die.

 Nick : Don't tell me he was naked. 
 Lily : As the day he was born. 
 Nick : No, he wasn't. 
 The wife is trying to pull her clothes on out here, my boss runs away, the husband finds him hiding in the meat locker holding a frozen brisket in front of himself. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's why the boss sold the restaurant. 
 You kind of have to leave town if you're caught sleeping with the mayor's wife. 
 Yeah... 
 So, uh, what made you decide to buy it, then? 
 It was time. 
 When I was 17, um... I lost my fiancé and my baby. 
 Paige : That's awful. 
 It's hard to explain what happened, when the truth is, they just disappeared. 
 At least from my life. 
 I waited for a long time, hoping they'd turn up. 
 Hoping I'd get a second chance. 
 But it never happened. 
 And I realized, I had to take control of my life. 
 So I bought the restaurant. 
 And then, you got married. 
 No. 
 As corny as it sounds, he was the love of my life. 
 This is our engagement ring. 
 One day, who knows... 
 Maybe he'll come back. 
 Listen to me! I have a... you're just passing through, I've kept you long enough. 
 No, no no. 
 If we wanted to stay the night... 
 Oh, there's, um, There's a B and B at the north end of Main Street. 
 Okay. 
 You can't miss it. 
 It was really nice talking with you. 
 Paige : You too. 
 You too. 
 (Sighing) 
 How did you get here? 
 Oh, well, security's pretty bad on the trains. 
 So, I just... slipped on. 
 Every cab in Bear Valley knows where you live. 
 And Ruth let you? 
 No... 
 I, um... 
 (Sobbing) I'm... I... 
 Hey. 
 You let a human child simply walk into your house? 
 It's my house. I choose who's welcome here. 
 It is a choice that exposes you, all of us. 
 We can't pretend that humans don't exist. 
 To have our children, yes. 
 To do business, of course. 
 But to befriend? The risk is too high. 
 Well, that's not your decision to make. 
 It is the only decision to make. 
 Then you and I have a fundamental difference of opinion. 
 Because here, on my territory, I am the Alpha. 
 Here, on my territory, I make the rules. 
 Is that clear? 
 And if you think there is not a ripple effect, you're wrong. 
 A nuclear bomb goes off here, who's to say Russia is not downwind from your mess? 
 (Reading) "To the happy couple." 
 (Giggling) 
 Well, nothing but the best for us here. 
 Hm. First someone steals our cell phones, and now screw-top champagne. 
 They don't want us here. 
 Hah! 
 Well after a few sips of this here good stuff none of that will matter. 
 (Chuckling) 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Lily was pretty great. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought I'd feel a lot of things when I saw my mom but... guilt was not one of them. 
 What do you mean? 
 Witches make sure you don't have sons. 
 Werewolves steal them from their mothers, both of us hoping that secrecy will make everything okay. 
 What my dad did I used to think was the right thing to do, but now, I mean... he broke her heart. 
 But according to your rules, it saved her life. 
 (Scoffs) You know... 
 Every so often I'll see a family. 
 A dad, a mom, a couple of kids. 
 And I can't help but think... what's that like, you know? To be normal. 
 Is that what you want? 
 No secrets, nothing to hide. 
 Somebody I can talk to about... everything. 
 Yeah. 
 That's what I want.

 We have a lot to talk about. 
 Karl : Enlighten me. 
 Marsten, you son of a bitch. 
 Savannah : I keep having this vision that you're... getting killed. 
 You're being eaten... 
 Ruth told me once, my mom could do it too. 
 Okay, see into the future, a premonition of something that will happen. 
 That's what you think this is? 
 You're dying. You asked me to help you. 
 But I can't. 
 That's why you came here, to warn me. 
 You have to believe me. 
 Okay, this... this isn't just a dream.

 Aleister was there too. 
 Aleister is dead. 
 I know you think this is a premonition...

 Danvers, what was that? 
 Stay here. 
 What's going on?

 The lights, those noises, was that you? 
 At Aleister's compound, when you were angry, you had trouble controlling your powers. 
 What's going on? 
 That's him. 
 The werewolf I saw in my premonition. 
 I don't care who this girl is, or what she means to you. 
 She knows what I am. 
 So she has to die.

 Two  club sandwiches... extra bacon, fries,  with  a side of fries, and a chocolate milkshake. 
 How was your second lunch? 
 Nick : Well, I think I earned it. 
 Lily. 
 Hi. 
 I know you're leaving tomorrow, I just, I was wondering, um... 
 What's going on? 
 Lily : When you came to the restaurant, I figured you must know. 
 And that you came for a reason. 
 I waited for you to say something, and when you didn't, I thought maybe I was wrong. 
 And maybe... maybe it was a coincidence that you're here, but I... I don't think it is. 
 And I couldn't let you leave without telling you. 
 Lily, I... I don't know what you're... 
 You're my son, Nick. 
 I know you're my son. 
 What... What are you talking about? 
 Over the years, Antonio... sent me pictures... showing me that you were okay. 
 I'm sorry... 
 I can't do this. 
 Just give us a minute, okay? 
 Nick! 
 Paige : Nick. 
 Nick, wait. 
 What am I doing, Paige? 
 We can't just leave. 
 She knows, and you have to face this. 
 Don't let her lose you twice. 
 This is way too dangerous. 
 She knows that you're her son, but it's not like she knows the rest of it or that she ever has to find out. 
 Okay? Just go and talk to her. 
 Okay. (Sigh) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 What? 
 There's another werewolf nearby. 
 How can you tell? 
 'Cause I can smell him. 
 It could be just a coincidence, some random werewolf travelling through? 
 No, in this tiny town when I'm here? 
 No, that's not a coincidence. 
 Okay... 
 We've got to draw him away from here. 
 Away from her. 
 Come on. 
 So, you're saying she's a  vedma. 
 A witch? Yes. 
 Those noises, what happened to your lights... that was her. 
 It's possible, yes. 
 It doesn't matter what she is. 
 The rules are clear. 
 She knows about us. 
 And we know about them. 
 Their kind, and they don't want to be discovered either. 
 And you make decisions! 
 Who to trust, what to do, decisions that affect us all. 
 In my territory, in my home, Roman? 
 Yes, I do. 
 No! 
 Here's what you're going to do. 
 And when I speak, assume that I am speaking for all of the others. 
 You're going to kill that girl. 
 And you're going to find a successor for this Pack. 
 One who will put all of our needs ahead of his own. 
 That is not going to happen.

 By meeting with the Spanish, huh?

 Escobedo wants to kill Jeremy. 
 He wants me to help him. 
 I was going to call you.

 Why should I believe you?

 Because Jeremy let me live. 
 I owe him my life! 
 Okay, if this Mutt is tracking me, I'll create a distraction. 
 I'll find out who the hell he is.

 I need you to stay here until I come back for you. 
 We're going to have some visitors. 
 Please... 
 If what I saw... if what I showed you is going to happen... 
 Okay. 
 I know you're scared, and you're worried about me. 
 You said you would never let anything bad happen to me. 
 I don't want anything bad to happen to you. 
 Okay.

 You led me on quite the chase. 
 But it's over. 
 Take me to Nick Sorrentino now, or I will finish her.

 It's done. 
 Roman's jacket...

 Where is your Pack? 
 Dealing with what remains. 
 We can't take any chances. 
 I agree. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 You're an Escobedo. 
 Why are you hunting me? 
 When Jeremy killed Rodrigo, he started a war. 
 There will be nothing left for you in Stonehaven. 
 No Jeremy, no Elena, and no Clay. 
 Whether you kill me or not, you'll be on your own.

 You bind me, cut my hand. 
 If you are wrong, you will be dead by dawn.

 Eduardo : (Muffled)  The landscape is changing, Jeremy. 
 Jeremy :  Change is inevitable. 
 Eduardo's with Jeremy now. 
 Roman : He has brought others from his Pack with him. 
 Elena : They're here because Jeremy is telling you the truth. 
 Eduardo wants you dead. 
 This is proof of nothing. 
 You want proof? 
 Then shut up and listen. 
 Eduardo : (Muffled)  I believe you are a student of history. 
 Jeremy : You know me well. 
 I am fond of a quote by Lenin. 
 He says sometimes history... 
 Needs a push. 
 It is time for a change. 
 And if that change must be pushed, then so be it. 
 And what is it that's so desperately in need of fixing? 
 Eduardo : (Faintly) Spain is a gorgeous country. 
 There is none more beautiful in the world. 
 But... 
 I want more. 
 Eduardo : You know... (Indistinct)

 Jeremy : Why have me kill Roman? 
 He has been around too long, trapped in the old ways. 
 I need Alphas who will take chances with me. 
 Not stand against me. 
 Is that why you came here? 
 To convince me to join with you? 
 No. 
 I know you will not bend. 
 So, I'm taking you out of the equation, Jeremy. 
 You and Roman fought. 
 Sadly it was deadly for both of you. 
 But it's an opportunity for me.

 I was hoping that Danvers was lying. 
 Be careful, Roman. He killed Rodrigo.

 And now you've confirmed it. 
 We won't have to convene the Council to decide your fate. 
 Savannah : Elena! 
 (Whimpering) 
 It looks as though my execution may be postponed. 
 (Panting) 
 We have to get going. 
 Who is he? 
 (Effort grunt) 
 They're going to kill Jeremy. 
 Maybe Clay and Elena too. 
 We have to leave. 
 Where's Lily? 
 I told her to wait for us back at the restaurant. 
 (Sighing) 
 I heard her talking to you, Paige. 
 She knows what I am. 
 You can't kill her! 
 Nick. 
 Nick! 
 Let me and my guard walk out the door. 
 That's not an option, Eduardo. 
 Please let me go. Please just let me... 
 Danvers, let him kill the girl. 
 It will solve all our problems. 
 No, that's not going to happen. 
 (Suspenseful music, mixed eerie whispers)

 Savannah : Elena... 
 Stay with her. 
 Eduardo, he's in the forest. Get him. 
 I'm on it. 
 What happened to that man... 
 Witches can do that? 
 They would make bad enemies. 
 And good allies. 
 If you do not capture Eduardo tonight, it does not matter. 
 The Spanish Pack is finished. 
 I will tell the other Alphas. 
 You have my word. 
 And the girl, I will decide what happens to her. 
 As you said, this is your territory. 
 You make the decisions. 
 The world is changing. 
 We have to change with it. 
 (Clears throat) 
 I'm not sure that's the answer. 
 (Speaking in Russian) 
 Jeremy. 
 Clay told me on the phone: Eduardo wanted you to be part of his plan. 
 I never would have worked for the Spanish. 
 I know that. 
 Their wine can be so... unctuous. 
 (Laughing) 
 We have to know who we can trust. 
 (Door opens) 
 Nick, thank God you're safe. 
 Lily, I... 
 Please, let me talk. 
 Please. 
 I know who you are, Nick. 
 And I know what you are, too. 
 I know because I saw your father transform. 
 When you were born, he told me he had to leave. 
 To keep you safe. 
 To keep me alive. 
 It was the hardest thing I have ever done. 
 But I understood. 
 You thought that maybe he'd be able to come back. 
 (Sighing) 
 He wanted to send me money. 
 To make sure I was okay. 
 But to be safe, to be sure, I told him I could make it on my own as long as he sent me a picture every year. 
 This was the first year he missed. 
 He's dead, Lily. 
 No. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 His last words to me were your name. 
 He wanted me to come find you. 
 But now that I'm here, I wish that I hadn't come, because I brought so much danger into your life. 
 I mean... 
 No, no, no. 
 A happy moment with you... is worth all the heartbreak in the world. 
 (Quiet sobs) 
 I loved your father. 
 And I will always love you. 
 My boy. 
 All these years, I have kept his secret. 
 And I will do the same for you. 
 For us. 
 Both : (Sobbing)
