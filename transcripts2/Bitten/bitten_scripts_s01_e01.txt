 What happened? 
 I have to go. 
 Now...? 
 We're kind of in the middle of something. 
 I totally forgot. We got carried away. 
 Five minutes. 
 No, I-I... really, I have to get my camera. 
 I have models waiting for me at the studio. I'm sorry. 
 Could you, please?

 Is this what they mean by "suffering for art"? 
 My suffering, your art?

 Good. 
 Tell me what you know about the Danvers family.

 They're hot, but weird. 
 What do you know? 
 Just what I've been told. 
 They think they can set the rules. 
 What rules? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I'm here to break them. 
 Would you like to come back to my place? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Because you're a slut. 
 Be careful out there.

 Oh, jeez, you are gonna kill me one of these days. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 So, where were we, huh? 
 Mm... How was your shoot? 
 Mm... tiring. 
 I had to pull an all-nighter. 
 Did you get what you needed? 
 Pretty sure, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Woman : For now. 
 And while I was out, all I could think about was you. 
 Your lips on mine... 
 (Soft grunt) and your hands on my hips. 
 And this... 
 (Panting) 
 What my hands can do. 
 Man : To fully actualize self, we have to acknowledge who we really are. 
 It's what Carl Jung referred to as  the animus  for males or  the anima  for females. 
 These are the sides of us that we hide beneath what he calls  the persona , and in applying these theories to anthropology, specifically the study of human behaviour... 
 I'm not so much interested in what we hide, but why we hide it. 
 What deep desires are we repressing? 
 And if we tore down our personas, what sort of beast lies within? 
 Woman : When he coined the terms "anima" and "animus", you don't really think he meant beasts within us, do you, Professor Danvers? 
 We are animals, all of us. 
 The only difference between humans and anything else is the persona, the mask behind which we hide all desires, everything that scares us about ourselves. 
 Man : So, what's on your mind? 
 Woman : It happened last night. 
 It almost happened in front of Philip. 
 But it didn't, right? 
 I had to lie to get away. 
 It was like... 
 My whole body was rioting against me. 
 I had to change in an alley. 
 Well, how long did you go between your runs this time? 
 37 days. 
 Are you insane? 
 I don't know, you're the shrink. 
 Psychologist. 
 Well, the offer stands if you want to run with me. 
 I miss running in a pack. 
 Okay, Logan, don't take this the wrong way. 
 I love you and I am so grateful to have you in the city, but I don't want to run. 
 Period. 
 I don't want to make a social outing of it. 
 Okay. But you have to get on a schedule. 
 Once a week, otherwise this is just going to keep happening. 
 You push the change until it finally overtakes you. 
 (Door buzzer buzzing) 
 That's my 11:00 o'clock. 
 I'll clear out. Thanks. 
 Want to grab a sandwich for the road? 
 Yeah. 
 At least I know I'm not going to wolf out in the middle of Philip's award thing tonight. 
 His whole family's going to be there. 
 Oh, well then, you're lucky the change forced itself on you when it did. 
 Next time you might not be so lucky. 
 Listen, no one's gonna judge you if you can't make it out here. 
 You can always go back home. 
 I am home now. 
 (Bird squawking) 
 Blue! 
 (Barking) 
 Blue, what you got, boy? 
 (Panting) 
 Dang it. 
 Dammit, Blue, what you got? 
 (Whimpering) 
 Huh? 
 Oh, Lord. 
 Woman : God, look at that bicep! Or is that a thigh? (Chuckle) 
 Either way, I have to get back to Crossfit. 
 And that, tell me it's gross. 
 Who am I kidding? I would eat that brownie out of the garbage if I could. 
 Or you could just have some. 
 I'm on a cleanse. 
 You read Goop? 
 I don't know what that means. 
 When did you get this? 
 Oh, six month anniversary present. 
 I assumed you helped him pick it out. 
 No, but apparently my big brother's got some tricks of his own, the sly dog! 
 OK, these are perfect. 
 A week from now, the gallery will be filled with the glitterati, but no one will care because they'll be too mesmerized by your photos. 
 Please tell me you're coming. 
 What is your excuse this time? 
 Look... 
 Setting me up with your brother was one thing, albeit one amazing thing... 
 But just, you know, know that when I'm not at one of your parties, I'm with him... 
 Making him happy. 
 Okay, if you're saying that to make me stop, fine, you win. 
 (Cellphone beep) 
 That is my reminder. 
 I've got to leave in 20 to get Becky at the airport. 
 Are you ready for tonight? 
 The entire McAdams clan, together at last. 
 Yeah. 
 I can't wait to spend more time with your mom. 
 Don't lie. We'll get you through it. 
 ( ♪ ) 
 (Birds chirping)

 Blue found her. 
 Didn't kill her, though. 
 What the hell did this to you? 
 (Brakes squeaking) 
 (Sniffing) 
 (Gust of wind) 
 Well... if it isn't Boo Radley. 
 Don't start with that. 
 They're quiet, they keep to themselves. 
 I'd prefer if more around here were like that. 
 Is there anything I can help you with? 
 Officer : There's not much anyone can do at this point, Mr. Danvers. 
 What do you think could've done that? 
 The coroner will rule cause of death. 
 That's an animal kill. 
 Deputy O'Neil, could you get the tarp out of the truck? 
 No one else needs to see this. 
 Michael Braxton here tells me that he's heard wolves up your way in the past. 
 I don't hunt up at Stonehaven, so I'm not entirely aware of what passes through, but yes, we've heard wolves as well. 
 Officer : Well, the coroner rules a wolf kill, I'm gonna wanna do a one mile sweep of this area, which will include your property. 
 Of course. Anything I can do to help. 
 (Message alert chime) 
 Women : Thanks, Professor. 
 (Giggling) 
 (Dialling beeps) 
 Prof. Danvers :  Hey, Jeremy, what's up? 
 There's a Mutt here. 
 A girl was killed. 
 I can be back in two hours. I'll deal with it as soon as I get to Bear Valley. 
 Come straight here. I am calling everyone home. 
 I can handle it. 
 Clay, I want everyone here first. 
 Everyone? 
 Just come home. 
 (Hang up click) 
 Woman : I don't know if it's the right fit. I mean, it could be great, but... 
 It's head chef, like, now, today. 
 Yeah, but you don't like the kitchen. 
 Yes, but it's my chance to write a menu. 
 Or, you can wait six months for Leo to move back to France and you get to be head chef at a restaurant you already love with a clientele who already loves you. 
 You don't have to conquer the world today, right?

 Mr. Smith, Mrs. Smith... 
 This has been a pleasure. 
 I'll leave the account to the room open. 
 You can order anything you want from room service. 
 I have to go.

 I got us doubles. Could be a long night.

 (Chuckling) 
 To Philip McAdams, marketing guru extraordinaire. 
 To you. 
 The creative can't create without a muse. 
 Brace yourself incoming. 
 Ah-h! There's my big bro! 
 Philip! 
 Oh! 
 Hi! 
 Oh my God, you are way prettier than Diane described! 
 You must be Becky. 
 You are so handsome, brother... 
 Lovely to see you again, Elena. 
 I'm so glad you could make it. 
 Oh, um, I've... been going to Philip's things since he was born. 
 Haven't missed one yet. 
 I'm so happy  you  could make it. 
 Of course. 
 Let's get you a drink, mother. 
 Sure. 
 Baby sis, kudos on beating me to the altar. 
 I have one bit of advice for you - elope... 
 Mother's voice :  I'm allowed to be picky about my son's choices. 
 Diane's voice :  Actually, you're not. Clearly he's a grown man. 
 He's also my only son. And he met her on a blind date. 
 Yeah, set up by me... Philip : But you're all right? I'm good. Honestly, everything's fine, it's just... a lot to do in the next two weeks. If you need any help, just let me know. Oh, God, no! Mother won't let anyone come near the preparations. The only thing you need to worry about is finding a dress. Oh, I thought I'd just wear this dress. W... Of course, what was I thinking? I should find something special for the special occasion. I will sort you out tomorrow, right? To all the ladies in my life, finally together. I wouldn't wanna do this night any other way. (Glasses clinking) Cheers. (Insects chirping) We came as fast as we could. Antonio. Hmm? Nick... Mm, hey, buddy. Thought you were in Italy. Well, moving the Italian Pack's assets through Geneva only took a day, so I spent the rest of the time on the Amalfi coast. Nick grabbed me from JFK. Yeah, jet-set over here. Where's Jeremy? He's downstairs. (Sniffing) Jeremy : Hello, old friend. Hey. You look good. Nick... Glad you're here. Good to see you. So what do you know? It looked like a wolf kill, and the coroner will determine that soon enough, but... I could smell it was not merely a wolf. We haven't had any problem with Mutts in our territory for years. Who's top of the sh1t list? You see, that's the thing. I've never smelt him before, I have no idea who he is. Some random Mutt comes and kills in our territory. Why? The most important thing is the kill itself. Whoever this is, they broke a cardinal rule by killing a human for sport. They have to pay for that. So what's the plan? I've called everyone home. We'll deal with this as a Pack. All of us? Everyone comes home. Peter, Logan... Elena? Jeremy : Yes, Elena. It's been years since she left. She hasn't shown any signs of coming back. Pete and Logan will talk to her. If she doesn't come? She's our best tracker and she knows it. She'll come. She'll come. Emcee : And the winner of the Best New Agency Award goes to... McAdams Creative Solutions. (Applause, cheering) Whoo-oo-oo! Congratulations, well earned. Thank you. (Indistinct chatter) Philip : Well, this started as a simple print ad campaign. Protect your family, it's a universal concept. There's nothing new here... except what we decided to do next. For an additional dollar a year, they now offer coverage for the zombie apocalypse. (Mixed chuckles) The numbers shot through the roof just by shifting an old concept to a new generation. All we're selling is what people already want family. And to protect the ones we love. (Cellphone buzzing) So I'm honoured that this campaign landed us best new agency of the year. So thank you to Cassie Awards and to my own family. (Cheering, applause) What is it? How come you didn't call Jeremy back? I haven't had a chance yet. A girl was killed by a Mutt in Bear Valley. Jeremy called a meet. He expects us all to be there, it's a family obligation. Not my family anymore, so not my obligation. Just call him back. You know you have to. Or at least meet me and I can tell you what I know. Fine. Tomorrow, first thing. 
 
 (Mixed chatter) You really think I wouldn't smell him on my way in? Seriously... I may not be garden fresh, but I don't smell that bad. Come here. (Chuckling) I missed you, kid. It's good to see you too. You look great. But if you're here to spring more of this "us" stuff on me, just tell me now. No, no, everyone else is in Stonehaven. I was supposed to start the North American leg of the Neil Young tour. Instead, I'll be heading to the house tomorrow. See, that's the thing, right? We all have our lives here. He expects us to just pick up and rush back. You're... you're just building your client base, right? You can't leave them. Yeah, it's getting sorted out. It's not like Jeremy's calling us back for a tea party. This Mutt does anything to shine light on our existence, we don't have these lives for much longer. Which Mutt killed the girl? Jeremy doesn't know. He caught the scent, but he can't place it. Well, that's easy. Which one's the most pissed off at Clay right now? Besides you? Clay is reason enough for me not to go back. A girl was killed, Elena, right outside Stonehaven. The Pack needs you. What about what I need? Huh? My life is here now. It's... it's a normal existence where people go to brunch a-and they don't murder to hide their secrets! I just wanna be normal. Sweetheart, that ship sailed years ago. Elena : What if I pop by your office, to make sure you're there? I'll be there. However, the doors are locked on Sundays, so... How convenient. Buzz me, I'll come down and get you. You know I won't. P.S., I know you're going to be in a sports bar, with a beer, watching football. That is not true. I'll be watching golf. You're sure there's nothing I can do to convince you to... stay here and watch me try on dresses? Mm, nice try. She's your best friend. For the million things that I love about Diane, her deep, deep passion for shopping is not one of them. Well, the fact that you're doing this anyway, because it makes her happy, is possibly number one in the million reasons why I love you. Really? That's number one? Yeah... right this second. You're just trying to convince me that I should do this. Is it working? No. (Doorbell ringing) Have fun. Mm-hmm. Hi. Hi. There's pomegranate juice in the fridge and coconut ice cream in the freezer. Bless you! Hi. Hey. Ready? So, my designer pal hooked me up with a little bit of everything for you. And I made sure they'll all be dresses that would meet my mother's approval. So if that one doesn't work... Wow. That one works. I think we're done here. Really...? The first one? Uhh... I do kind of love it. When you find the one you love, you can search all you want and you're gonna come back to it. To the first dress. Damn you for looking so good in it. It's not like I'm gonna upstage the bride. No, you're gonna upstage me. Man 1's voice :  20 bucks says I bang the blond. Man 2's voice :  I'd like to see you try. If anyone's gonna upstage the bride, it's your mother. You joke, but you're right. Did we order these? They're courtesy of the gentlemen at the bar. He also wanted me to give you this. Let me handle this. Uh... go get him, tiger. Well, hello. Hi. I see you got my message. I did. But you see, I'm having a really nice drink with my boyfriend's sister. Boyfriend. Lucky guy. Let me ask you... The drinks I understand, but this? Did you really think giving me the key to your hotel room would work? Nothing ventured. Thanks, but no thanks. Oh, just like that? Ugh... ah! Ahh, please, I was just joking! Uh... Elena? Are you okay? I'm fine. Look, can we just keep this between us? I'm not gonna pry, but... Screw it, I'm gonna pry. What was that? I mean, there's usually only one reason women know that kind of self-defence. Sometimes it's to prevent anything bad from happening. Other times, it's to prevent those things from happening again. The thing about bad families is they make it easy to know when you've landed in a good one. How quickly you forget about my mother. (Chuckling) Right... ( ♪ ) Jeremy : Sheriff. Mr. Danvers. I, uh, thought you'd wanna know... The coroner confirmed it was a wolf kill. The locals are calling for a bounty, but wolf hunting is illegal in this state, so we're asking folks to just keep an eye out and, uh... report any sightings. Now that wolf's had a taste for blood, it's got to be caught, put down. Well, we could put traps up around the property line. Traps and would-be hunters... dangerous combination. You're right. We would be more than happy to check out the property for you. Have a nice day. Great. Trigger-happy hunters and a killer Mutt. This can't end soon enough. We need Elena. ( ♪ ) Hey. I thought you guys would be here. Uh, we went out for a drink. Oh, day drinkers. Should I be worried? Well, no need to stage an intervention just yet, no. Are you sure? Because, Elena Michaels, your behaviour has affected me in the following ways... I now have six kinds of tea in my kitchen and zero kinds of beer in my fridge. And I sleep on a side of the bed and I cannot remember the last time that I brought home a whole roasted chicken and just ate the entire thing. Wow, I had no idea the impact I have on your life. (Message alert chime) Home? Where's home? Jeremy Danvers is a part of my extended family. Not one of those foster homes? No. Real family. Sort of. I-it's, uh, it's complicated. And where the hell were they when you were bouncing around the system? I didn't know that they existed. And they certainly didn't know I existed until I was an adult. So that's home? Yeah. About 100 miles west of Syracuse. But Toronto is my home now, so... Look, forget it, I... I'm ignoring it. They're your family. Saying no to family is a slippery slope. Call them back. Okay. (Remote phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Hello? It's good to hear your voice. (Sigh) It got disconnected. They live in the middle of nowhere. The phone lines go out all the time. I'll... I'll try again later. It's gonna be okay. Thank you. Hmm. She hung up. What are you doing answering the phone? We're trying to get her here, not remind her of the reasons why she left. She's not gonna call back. ( ♪ ) (Howling in the distance) Well... this is a pleasant surprise. I thought you didn't wanna run with me. I'm allowed to change my mind. I thought maybe you'd be at Stonehaven by now. I've got a patient in a tailspin, so I can't get away until tomorrow afternoon, but... A meet is a meet. We can't ignore that, right? Alright, let's go. We go home, resolve this Mutt issue, come back to our lives here. It's like we're soldiers. We're family. In this case, it's the same thing. ( ♪ ) (Groaning in pain) (Bones cracking) (Roaring) (Grunting) (Bones cracking) (Groaning, snarling) ( ♪ ) (Coyote howling) (Snarling) (Whimpering, snarling) Hey... Listen, I have to go. Did you sleep? An hour, tops. How's your back? Oh, coyote took a good run on me, but it's not a big deal. So, what excuse you giving Rachel about going back to Stonehaven? Well, you've just got to make it serious enough so they don't ask questions, and vague enough so you don't get caught up in the details. Cousin got in a car accident, it's serious. That's all we know. It's just, I've never had to qualify my relationship with you to somebody. We're cousins. Rachel never questioned that. And in the grand scheme of things, we're related because of what we are. So, it's not a total lie. I just wish we didn't have to lie to them at all. Yeah, but think, once we're there, we can run free, no questions asked. Okay well, see, that's the problem. 'Cause the minute that I get out there, the questions start. Clay grilling me on my year away... I couldn't possibly tell him about Philip. Yeah. Unless you want to put Philip's life at risk. (Sigh) No, I'm kidding. Well, sort of. But listen, that coyote was coming at me. You had my back, right? That's what we do for each other. That's why Jeremy's calling you back home. The Pack needs you. What if I want out altogether? (Sigh) You're a werewolf, Elena. Ultimately, there is no "out". I'll be on the first train. It's the right thing to do. Yeah. ( ♪ ) Hey. Were you on a shoot? Woke up, surprised to see you gone. Um, no. I was with Logan. Logan... Your therapist? Uh, Logan's not my therapist. He is my cousin. Your cousin? Yeah, our family tree is more like a forest. So... Why wouldn't you just tell me that from the get-go? Look... I don't like talking about my messed up family. But there was a car accident. One of my cousins was pretty bad, so I should probably go and be with them. They'll need help with the kids. (Sighing) I'm sorry. Go, take care of them. Thank you.
