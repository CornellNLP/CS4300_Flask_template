 Previously, on "Bitten"... 
 You've not been to your apartment since you've been back. 
 You've moved in here by stealth, right? 
 Elena : Zachary Cain. 
 Clay : Something's not right. 
 Cain's not smart enough to come up with a plan. 
 Karl Marsten. 
 Since when did Mutts work together? 
 Never. 
 Marsten and Cain are building an army. 
 Everything they're doing is because of you, Clay. 
 What do you want, Mr. Boggs? 
 I want what you got. Word is, Pack's weak. 
 There's only one way to become top dog. 
 (Mixed grunts) 
 Jeremy and the others haven't been entirely honest with you. 
 What, and you have? 
 Clay is out of control. 
 (Grunting) 
 No more half-measures. 
 You really think that's necessary? 
 I want word to get out that if you come at me... 
 (Cracking) 
 Ahhh! there will be serious consequences. 
 Clay, what's wrong? 
 I've done things. 
 Necessary things. 
 I feel like I'm barely holding my head above water. 
 I want to be a better man, Elena. 
 Please come home. 
 Dennis Stillwell is dead. 
 What about Joey? 
 There's only one body. They took his eyes. 
 Woman : The blond woman you came in with, she left a few minutes ago. 
 You're not going to like what's inside. 
 Antonio : Are we positive these came from Dennis Stillwell? 
 I saw his body. 
 His eyes were gouged out. Those are his. 
 Were  his. 
 Santos is going to pay dearly for this. 
 (Cellphone chiming) 
 Sorry, I'll just... 
 (Chiming continues) 
 You going to answer that? 
 Hello? 
 Why don't you ask him yourself? 
 Go ahead. 
 How did you like my gift? 
 Jeremy :  You sick b*st*rd. 
 Why did you kill Dennis Stillwell? 
 Santos :  Technically it wasn't me. 
 But you've got to admit, it's an attention grabber. 
 You have my attention. 
 Good. 
 Because I want to be heard, and taken seriously. 
 Well, it'll be hard for you to talk after I rip your throat out. 
 (Laugh) 
 You see, now, that is what we need to be talking about. 
 The violent ways with which you uphold the Pack laws. 
 Now you know how it feels to be on the receiving end. 
 All that my associates and I want is to get out from underneath the Pack's oppressive rule. 
 The rules of our society have been established for centuries. 
 What makes you think we'd be interested in changing them now? 
 Well, I'm sure you're not, Antonio, since you're the ones in power. 
 But there are a number of us who think it's about time for a new world order. 
 If you don't agree, that's fine. But you can count on having some more funerals. What have you done with Joey Stillwell? He's safe for now. Still has all his body parts, which is more than I can say for Samuel Boggs. Boggs thought we were weak. He needed to be taught a lesson. Dennis Stillwell thought we were second class citizens. He was taught a lesson as well. Jeremy :  What do you want? A meeting. You and I get together, hash things out. Great. Come to Stonehaven, we'll talk. You still haven't gotten the blood stains out of your carpet from the last Santos that was killed there. I was thinking we could meet at the park, on the east side of Bear Valley. That doesn't work for me. Then please, select a location other than your fortress. I'll come alone, and in good faith. I'll trust you to do the same. Fine. There's an abandoned campground just off county road 35. There's a pavilion on the west side. I'll meet you there. Sounds good to me. How about tomorrow,  say noon? I'll see you there. Good. (Beep) You can't trust anything he says. Jeremy : No, I know that. We can't just sit here and let them pick us off one by one. We have to find a way to turn this meeting into our advantage, maybe get a lead on where that warehouse is. Clay and Elena, you head there now. Find stakeout positions. ( ♪ ) You all right? I'll be fine once Santos and the others are put down. I'm talking about your phone call, Clay. What was that all about? I was... just having a rough time with some Mutt discipline. I thought that was second nature for you. It's not the same as it used to be. Are you all right now? I'm better now that you're here. I came because of Dennis. And Santos. ( ♪ ) I've got a vantage point on the south side. Clay : (On phone)  I found a spot on the north end  but it's too exposed. I'm going to keep scouting. I want to be ready for whatever Santos has in store. ( ♪ ) ( ♪ ) Bitten 1x07 - Stalking Original air date February 22, 2014 Philip : Hey, Sylvie. It's Philip. I was wondering if you could help me find someone who posted a video. I've tried to track them down myself, but... No, no. No, you don't have to come over, it's... if you could just... An hour. Yeah, I'll be here. Looking forward to seeing you too. Antonio : I'm thinking of booking Serenity of the Seas. Ah, two months? Six continents? Well, that sounds perfect. Yes, that's right, Stillwell. All right, thank you. I... I look forward to it. (Sigh) Sounds like Dennis is going on a cruise. A really nice one too. My guy posing as him is in for a hell of a trip. Closing out someone's life with a couple of calls... What a thankless job. Ah, but necessary. We don't want the other families alarmed about these deaths. You know, I never envied you being Pack fixer. It's not so bad, once you take out the emotion and focus on the necessity of it. You know, I always figured you'd take over. I wouldn't be any good at that. Too much responsibility. You could handle it. You could, but you don't want to. I'm not like you, Dad. Okay, when you were my age, you already had a teenage kid. I don't know how you did it. I just adapted the circumstances and made the best of it. You'll see someday, you'll have a son of your own. I might already and not even know it. Okay, I hope you're kidding about that because we can't afford to take these things lightly. I know, I'm kidding. But there was that one night in Rio with a set of twins, and the details are kind of hazy, I mean... Last time you said it was triplets. I'm sorry, I overreacted. It's okay, you were scared. Yeah, well, after seeing those people in the ER with real emergencies, I felt ridiculous. Hey, listen, you're pregnant for the first time, and you were in pain. You can't take that lightly. And honestly, if the doctor prescribed a little bed rest for me, I'd take it. (Sigh) Hey, what's wrong, baby? It's not my first time. When I was younger, I was with this guy, and things got heavy kind of fast. I wasn't prepared for it. And you got pregnant. I never meant to keep it a secret, okay? I'm sorry I never told you. No, no, that's okay. What happened? When he found out he split, just disappeared out of my life. I was completely alone and... the stress was too much for me. A few weeks later I had a miscarriage. It was the low point of my life. So I'm scared. I'm scared that me being pregnant is going to drive you away and... I'm going to be alone again. Listen to me. There is nothing... nothing for you to be scared of. You are fine, the baby's fine, and we're fine. We're better than fine. And I'm not going anywhere. I promise you that. (Ominous ♪) ( ♪ ) Clay : (On phone)  You seeing this? Got it. Check out the box. It looks like the same wrapping as the other one from Santos. ( ♪ ) Jeremy, we've got a situation. Some kid just dropped off a box wrapped in the same paper as Stillwell's eyes. Elena, don't touch it. Antonio and I are on our way. Could be Joey's body parts. Could be a booby trap. Exactly. Nick, you stay and watch the property. We're going to head out there. (Snarling) (Knocking on door) I come bearing dark roast, fat free muffins, and the keys to unlocking the secret of the internet. Are you going to invite me in? Come on in. (Chuckling) Thanks, handsome. (Sigh) You haven't changed a bit, Sylvie. That's a good thing, right? Those wolves are beautiful animals. Philip : Pshh, yeah, but so brutal. Any luck tracking down that person who posted the video? Yeah, I've got an email address associated with the username. I'll have the rest of the info in a few minutes. Do I want to know how you're doing this? Mm, no. New girlfriend? How's everything at Bancroft Worldwide? Ehh, it's boring since you left. Does she live with you? It's a simple yes or no. The questions get harder in round two. She's just moved in. Does she make you happy? Yeah. If you say so. Nate Parker. Excuse me? The guy who posted the video. And, based on his labyrinthian security system, he's a real wirehead. Normally, I'd have been through those firewalls in half the time. Let's see... Oh. Also, he appears to be a bit of a nut job. He's written over 100 emails to government officials. Great. His last known address is an apartment in Corktown. So what now? Well, my client wants me to buy the rights to the video so we can use them in his ad campaign. I'll go with you. No, it's all right. I'll... I'll go. Philip, you're intelligent and beautiful and everything, but this guy is suspicious of the government. He sees you and all he'll see is a suit, and he'll shut down. I'll dress casual. Babe, you could go in there naked and he'd still see a suit. I can speak his language, so he'll trust me. You need me. Admit it. ( ♪ ) Jeremy : Oh, no. We really should keep going, Jeremy. She needs our help first. (Snarling, grunting) Elena : Cain... Come on. (Cellphone buzzing) Yeah. Antonio : (On phone)  Yeah, we're on our way,  but we came across an accident. Clay :  An accident? Is everything okay? I'll let you know. Recorded voice :  All circuits are busy... Damn it! ( ♪ ) What happened? Are you okay? Can you hear me? ...car came out of nowhere... took off... Antonio : Yeah, looks like the girl's in really bad shape. (Yelling in pain) (Grunt) It's an ambush! (Mixed grunting) How bad is it? Both : Ahh! Ahh! (Grunting) Nice to see you again, Antonio. Elena's voice :  Hi, you've almost reached Elena Michaels... Damn... (Snarling) (Mixed growling) (Mixed grunting) (Snarling) (Whimpering) Antonio and Jeremy are under attack! Go and find them. (Mixed grunting) Antonio! Aghh! (Grunting) (Tires screeching) Jeremy : Help Antonio. He's been hurt badly. (Groaning) We have to get him back to Stonehaven. Come on. (Groaning in pain) There we go. Man : How did you, um, locate me? I ran a heat seeker on your username. No... no way. I've got asbestos firewalls. (Laughing) Yeah, they're really not all that fireproof. I found a race condition in one of your logic gates and I just waltzed right into your computer. Seriously? Damn. You guys are the government? Do we look like we're from the government? He does. Philip : No, like I told you, my ad agency wants to acquire some of the footage you shot. Who says I'm interested in selling? I think your credit card company might like a little payoff on some of your overdue accounts. Who says I'm overdue? Okay, got a few bills. How much money are we talking about? How does $2000 sound? (Laugh) Are you serious? Is he serious? I mean, this is great stuff. Wolves running at Cherry Beach. I don't know. The quality's only fair and the camera work looks like it's done by a 10-year-old. Oh, so... you track me down so you can come here and insult me? How cool would it be to see your footage on TV? You're talking television, I'm talking 10 grand. Five grand. And you hand over all the footage you shot, you take down the video you posted, and you sign to me all your rights. $7500. Okay, five thou. But I want cash. Deal. (Tires screeching) ( ♪ ) What the hell happened? Your dad's in bad shape. We have to get him inside. (Panting) Dad... (Groaning) You're going to be okay, Dad. My God, are you...? I'll be fine. Help Clay get the medical supplies. We have to be fast. Antonio : (Groaning) Jeremy : Clay, I need gauze, pads, and tape. Okay, give me some, quick. We need to keep pressure on this. Elena, I need rubbing alcohol. Thank you. It's going to sting... (Yelling) Okay, cover it up. I need hemostatic powder. I need more gauze. (Groaning in pain) Jeremy : More pressure. Hang in there, Dad. Nicky, listen to me. Yes. We're going to roll him and we're going to wrap it back over, okay? Antonio : (Groaning in pain) Okay, got it? Take this way... I'm going to need some scissors, Clay. Stay with us. Nicky : Hang in there, Dad. Antonio : (Groaning softly) Better? (Coughing) I'll be okay, Nicky. We're going to track down Santos, okay? I know you will. How am I doing, doc? You're strong. You're going to be okay. You've never lied to me before, my friend. Don't start now. I'm going to do everything I can to get you through this. Okay. Ohh... ( ♪ ) Here you go. Hibiscus tea? Yeah, it's good for you. It's strong. It's too much? We've got some chamomile. No, this is good. It'll replace my Cabernet cravings for the next six months. Yeah, and our little girl will come out with a taste for the finer things. (Giggling) So you think it's a girl? Definitely. And how can you be so sure? Well, you know, I have my PhD, I know these things. I also know she's going to come out and take after you. She'll be beautiful, talented, smart. (Cellphone ringing) You can get that. Just remember where we left off. Going to get it? No, it's okay. We were just supposed to go running this week. I'll just call her back later. Sure? Positive. In that case, where were we? Logan's not answering. I don't want to text him with this, I'll just try later. Antonio : Jeremy... Shh. We can talk later, Antonio. You have to stop them. We will. We will, you and I together. You and I together. (Gasp) Clay : Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jeremy, Jeremy. Come on... (Grunting) Come on, come on. (Mixed chatter) Nicky : This doesn't look good. I'm fine. Elena : Tell me what to do. I'm fine. Jeremy, tell me what to do. Get some... get some antiseptic and some gauze. I got it, I got it. We need to stop the bleeding. Okay, we've just got to clean this out. (Indistinct comments) (Groaning) Sylvie : Do you think you have enough here to build a campaign? I hope so. I wish there was a way to improve the quality, though. I have a program on my computer at home that can increase the clarity and pull some frame grabs. Really? That'd be amazing. Why don't you come over? We could do it this afternoon. Or I could just send you a file. I wasn't hitting on you. No, I know, I just have a lot of work to do here, and there's... Philip, it's me. Clearly I'm making you uncomfortable. Yeah, it's a little awkward. There's no reason why it should be, not after all the time we spent together. That's what makes it awkward. You have to admit, we make a good team. Mm-hmm, but not a good couple. But we could have. You never really gave it a chance. Why is that? I mean, we were always great in bed, weren't we? Bed, kitchen counter, balcony... Sylvie. I know! s*x isn't everything, and I know I can be a little too intense, but still. What we had was great. But what I have now is... Better? For me. Well, she's a lucky girl. I hope she's everything you ever wanted and more. 
 
 Woman : (Moaning) You should have seen him, baby! Stabbed him in the leg! And then... the blood was flowing. Cain : Oh, you stabbed him real good, huh? Woman : You know it, baby! Both : (Loud moaning, grunting) (Laughing) (Sighing) That was amazing. You're amazing. (Chuckling) Oh, honey, your cut opened up. (Laughing) Does it turn you on? Everything about you turns me on. You want to go again? Ah, no one's ever tired me out before. Being with a werewolf is incredible. You can hold your own, for a human. I think that's a compliment. Definitely. You really didn't have to cut yourself. Mmm, I wanted it to be real. You said they could smell if the blood was fake or real, right? I've never known anyone like you. Baby, I've definitely never met anyone like you. ( ♪ ) He's bleeding internally. He's lost too much blood. Wh... what can we do? There's nothing more that I can do for him. W... well then, let's get him to a hospital. Nick! You know we can't do that. I'm not going to stand here and watch my father die! Nicky, Nicky... You can't fight this fight. Mm... Elena... I'm here, Antonio. The boys need you. I know. Take care of them. Clay... Yeah. You find it in your heart to forgive. I... I will. My friend, no more half-measures. Santos, all of them... (Grunt) My friend... it's time for you to rest now. Nicholas. Nicky. I'm right here, Dad. Come closer. Closer. (Inaudible) ( ♪ ) Thank you. (Soft grunts) ( ♪ ) (Sobbing) 30 years of friendship. (Sigh) So many little things you take for granted, and then... suddenly it's over. These Mutts need to be put down for good. I agree. No middle ground, no mercy. Elena... They killed Pete, they killed Antonio. What more is it going to take until we fight back? This is more than just killing a few Mutts. Nick, we can talk about this later. No, I have the rest of my life to grieve. We all do. Right now we need to go on the offensive, find out who else is involved and just how far this reaches. We also need to find out who that woman was at the ambush. Nick : The Mutts are getting desperate if they're bringing in humans to do their dirty work. So where do we start? Cain. That's the weakest link. Cain's hardly weak. Yes, he is, he's mentally weak. He's sloppy, he's careless. We need to find him and get him to talk. I'll go to the campground, see if I can pick up a scent. Not alone. You're going to go with Clay. Nick, you and I will stay to tend to Antonio's body. How's your wound? It's fine. Don't worry about me. I know how much he meant to you. To all of us. We can't bring Antonio back, but we can make this right. The box is gone. We were only here a few hours ago. Everything's changed. I can't stop thinking about Antonio and Pete. I know, me neither. They were my brothers. We aren't going to lose any more family. The only blood spilled from this point on will be Mutt blood. (Sniffing) He went North. Did your father tell you where he wanted his ashes spread? We never really discussed it. I guess neither of us wanted to face the reality that one day... You know he always really loved the... He loved the cherry grove on your family's estate. Uh, you'll have to forgive me. My stitching skills are... a little rusty. (Vehicle approaching) You go get that. I'll finish this up. Go. (Knocking on door) Sheriff. Mr. Sorrentino. Clayton Danvers here? He had some business to attend to. Is there anything I can help you with? Is Jeremy Danvers home? It's, uh, it's not a good time. It's never a good time to talk to the police, but we have a situation on our hands. We found Michael Braxton's body. His body. That's right. Morning, Sheriff. Mr. Danvers. I was just asking about you. Nick, could we have a moment? Would you like to come in? Thanks. See you in a few days. Who was it, baby? Santos. He and LeBlanc are headed to Manhattan for a couple days. They're on the run. Letting things cool off for a bit. Santos is a coward. Maybe. I don't know. He's got no balls. Not like you. You're not afraid of anything. You and me, we should start our own pack. It doesn't work like that. You're not one of us. But I could be. Just one little bite and I could be your werewolf queen. We'd kick ass, like Bonnie and Clyde. You know how that ends, right? Nobody gets out alive. It's the living part that counts. I want to live like you. And I want you to live, period. Think about it. We could have it all. You could be Alpha. You really think I care about that? You could settle do... We  could settle down. The house on the hill don't mean nothing if you're not in it. No, it's too dangerous. Forget it. You're assuming I'll die. I'm a fighter, baby. Look, you're my girl. And I knew from the first time I saw you that you were a fighter, but... this ain't a fight you can win. (Whispering) Baby... I'm going for nachos. Any idea which way he went? Give me a second. Cain went West. Let's go get him. Are these your paintings? Yes. They're beautiful. Thank you. You remind me of Turner. You know your art. I didn't always live in Bear Valley. We had great museums in Baltimore. Would you like to have a seat? You have some information about Mr. Braxton? His body was found just inside town limits. His throat was cut, which now makes this a homicide investigation. First wolf attacks, and now a murder. You don't think they're related? We'll see where the investigation takes us. What does this have to do with my son? You know Braxton was talking about coming up here to confront him. I understand he was very intoxicated when he made those statements. He had had a few drinks. From my limited experience, when a man's had a few too many drinks, he tends to be a bit boastful. And then when he sobers up, he gets a little more rational. Now, the last time any of us saw Mr. Braxton was the day that we found that poor dead child. All these artifacts... you must have a well-used passport. Actually, most of them were acquired by my son. He has a doctorate in anthropology. Is Clayton your son by birth? That's a... an interesting question. You just... you don't look old enough to have a son that age. Ha. You're trying to flatter me. (Chuckling) I actually brought him here when he was eight. So now he's a professor. You must be very proud. I'm very proud of all of my family. ( ♪ ) Clay : Good call. Tracks pointed the way. If we go in there we'll end with a lot of collateral damage. We should wait for him to come out. No. I wait for him to come out. ( ♪ ) Having a party? I am now. (Screeching) You're going to pay for that. You really think you can take me one-on-one? Easy. You're dumb and you're slow. (Mixed grunting) I'm done screwing around! I knew you wouldn't be too far behind your bitch. (Grunting) (Cracking) Don't kill him, we need him. (Grunting, panting) Clay! Clay, Clay, look at me! You can't kill him! (Panting) I didn't kill him. Let's get him out of here. Thanks for your time. I'll have Clay call as soon as he returns. I don't mind driving back out here to talk to him. I'd like to see the rest of the house. Maybe some other time, when you're not in the middle of a murder investigation. Yes. Yeah. Thanks again. (Panting) She's gone. (Groaning) Stay here, I'll grab the med kit. Okay. (Cellphone ringing) It's Jeremy Danvers. I'll call him back. Babe, it's Jeremy. You better take this. Hello? Jeremy :  Logan...  things have escalated. Antonio is dead. Everything okay? Logan, are you there? What happened? The Mutts attacked us. Are you all right? Yeah, I will be. I need you to come back. I'm so sorry, just... I'll come as soon as I can. Clay is bringing Cain in for questioning. The rest of the Mutts are still out there  and they're on a murderous spree. I want the family back here as a Pack. Logan :  Just... I have some things I need to take care of here first. Tell Nick I'm... My thoughts are with him. What's wrong? Just more family issues. How long are you going to be gone this time? I'm not going anywhere. Wow. Always wondered what this place looked like. Wait until you see the guest suite downstairs. Jeremy : Elena. You were successful. We got lucky. I think that we deserved a little bit of luck today, don't you? Jeremy... I may have lost a little bit more blood than I thought. I will be good as new in the morning. Are you sure? Yeah. (Cellphone chiming) Philip? Now's not the time. Call him back. Call him back. You need to assure him that you're all right. Otherwise he may be on the next train out here to Bear Valley. No, I'm more worried about you right now. Don't be. Call him. (Soft gasp) (Grunt) What now, tough guy? Now you tell me the location of the warehouse. Doesn't ring a bell. The place you and Marsten and your psycho buddy were talking about the other day at the motel. Oh, yeah. The motel. Marsten thought he smelled you and the bitch. You like the little gift we left behind for you? (Grunting) I guarantee you will tell me where to find them before I'm done with you. (Remote phone ringing) Philip : (On phone)  Hi. Hey, it's me. Where are you? Are you all right? I'm okay. Look, I'm... I'm sorry for leaving you like that. It was a horrible thing for me to do to you. Yeah, I'd have to agree. I just... I haven't had to deal with a death... in my family since my parents. And being with your family at the wedding, it all just sort of... hit me hard. I just needed to take some time to work through a few things. It's all right. Maybe one day you'll let me help you work through those things. That would be nice. Are you back at Bear Valley? For now. Is Logan there, or someone you can talk to? Elena : Some of the cousins are here. We're... we're dealing with it together. I hope you stay with me through this. You know I will. I'll see you soon. Yeah. (Impact thud) Jeremy? Jeremy! Hey... Jeremy... Nick! (Suspenseful ♪) ( ♪ ) This can't be just blood loss.
