 Previously, on "Bitten"... 
 A long time ago, maybe 20 years, a family lived here. 
 You're always going to be my little man, Clay. 
 Old man : Elle got killed by a wolf. 
 I tore her into bits. 
 (Angry shout) 
 Rodrigo is here to see the repercussions of treachery. 
 (Wet ripping) 
 (Choking, gurgling) 
 Something came at me in Rochester. 
 You need to keep me alive for what's coming. 
 Wherever they're taking Malcolm Danvers, is where we are going. 
 (Speaking foreign language) 
 Ruth : We're witches. 
 We're being hunted. 
 They want the werewolf that you have downstairs. 
 We're here for the one true cursed, Malcolm Danvers. 
 And so do we. 
 You want Malcolm, but I can't turn him over. 
 Something's wrong. 
 ♪ 
 When you're done your homework, one hour of television, that's it. 
 Girl : What do you care? You won't even be here. 
 You're supposed to be grounded. 
 I'm being nice. One hour, that's it. 
 You're not the boss. Well, I am when Ruth is away. 
 I'm locking the doors. 
 Not going to run away. Yeah, sure. 
 I've heard that before. I'll be back before dinner. 
 Did you do that? 
 No. 
 I'm serious, Savannah. 
 If you did that, you have to tell me. 
 I did tell you. I didn't do it. 
 (Bang, rumbling) 
 (Cracking, rumbling continues) 
 (Mixed whispers) 
 (Gasp) 
 Where did you come from? 
 No need to be afraid, Savannah. 
 How do you know my name? 
 Savannah : Paige? 
 Paige! 
 Wha... what's wrong with her? 
 Man : She'll be fine. 
 And yet,  she  gets to go out and have a fun afternoon. 
 What do  you  get to do? 
 Huh! Homework. 
 Who are you? 
 You can call me Aleister. 
 Savannah! 
 (Rumbling, cracking) 
 I've never heard of you before. 
 The coven doesn't tell you anything. 
 They're not your family, they don't care. 
 But I do. 
 And I want you to show them who you really are. 
 You are the most powerful witch of all. 
 I don't even have my powers yet. 
 But you will. Very soon. 
 And then you can show them that they shouldn't have taken you for granted. 
 It means coming with me. 
 Is that okay? 
 ♪ 
 (Squishing) 
 I am the lock. 
 I am the key.

 Bitten 2x03 
"Hell's Teeth" 
Original air date: February 21, 2015 
 ♪ 
 (Hard panting) 
 The trail's cold. Malcolm's gone. 
 Someone must've picked him up. 
 All the doors in the house were open. 
 That's not a coincidence and neither is this. 
 The witches must've taken Malcolm. 
 They have no idea what they've unleashed. 
 Logan : The point is, he's gone. 
 No. No, he can't be. 
 We promised the Alpha council his head on a stake. 
 I'm going to find him. 
 I'll go with him. 
 There's no sense in searching the woods. 
 Malcolm's gone. 
 There's no sense in any of this. 
 Clay : What now? 
 We can't just sit around and wait for the Alphas to return to mete out their punishment. 
 Without Malcolm, we have no way of protecting you from losing your seat. 
 This isn't just about Malcolm anymore. 
 There's a dead Alpha in our war room. 
 Killing Rodrigo could be interpreted as a declaration of war. 
 The other Alphas on the council cannot know he was here. 
 Or that Malcolm escaped. 
 We'll have to hide the body. 
 (High-pitched squeal) 
 (Clattering) 
 (Clattering) 
 ♪ 
 We go get Malcolm. 
 We know where the witches are, they left their card, okay? 
 It's in Jeremy's room. 
 (Rattling) 
 (Mixed whispers) 
 ♪ 
 Show yourselves. 
 Ruth : We come in peace. 
 You come empty-handed. 
 I've no clue what you're talking about. 
 Malcolm Danvers. I want him back. 
 Well, you're not getting him. 
 Then you're not getting this ring. 
 Which I assume is important to you since you came back for it. 
 ♪ 
 Stop this right now! 
 ♪ 
 Ruth : Paige, release him. 
 I'm only fighting fire with fire. 
 ♪ 
 (Thudding) 
 Jeremy! 
 (Slamming) 
 My apologies for such rude treatment. 
 If you ever do anything like that again, I'll tear your throat out. 
 Look... 
 Female werewolf. 
 We'd heard of your existence, but to actually see one... 
 She seems just as barbaric as the rest of them. 
 Sorry, was it "witch" or "bitch"? 
 What have you done with Malcolm? 
 We asked for your Pack's help. 
 You wouldn't give it. 
 So we did what any decent witch would do. 
 We went and we helped ourselves. 
 Without understanding the importance of the person you took. 
 Ruth : Oh, we understand all too well. 
 He's going to be the thing that saves our girl Savannah. 
 We should be on our way. 
 Uh-uh, you stay in our eye-line. 
 Jeremy : They have Malcolm. 
 Let's go get him! 
 Nick... 
 We need him. 
 We need him to lure this demon who calls himself Aleister Vi. 
 How do you know he wants Malcolm? 
 We can communicate with Savannah. 
 That's how we know about Aleister. 
 And that there is a werewolf on the compound that gave up Malcolm's name. 
 They attacked his house in Rochester, but he escaped. 
 But as dangerous as your wolf may be, he pales in comparison to Aleister. 
 Savannah has been through so much. 
 She's impressionable. 
 This monster... abducted her right from our home. 
 A 12-year-old girl. 
 We'll help you find your little girl. 
 Then we want Malcolm back. 
 Oh,  now  you want to play. 
 I don't want to play, I just want Malcolm. 
 And this seems to be the only way I'm going to get him. 
 Now, if Aleister shows up with the followers, you're going to need our assistance. 
 They're brutal fighters. 
 We've seen the evidence. 
 Our plan is to entice him. 
 We'll use Malcolm as the lure. 
 Once we contain Aleister, then we will force him to take us to our girl. 
 And we get Malcolm. 
 Ruth : As you wish. 
 We'll have no further use for him. 
 You two go with him now. 
 The rest of us will follow shortly. 
 I'm so glad you decided to be on our side. 
 There are no sides. 
 We're all just trying to get what we want. 
 Let's go, Paige. 
 So what do you, like, have Malcolm in your trunk or something? 
 Nice try. 
 We're not letting you anywhere near him until the deed is done. 
 Don't worry. We're taking good care of him. 
 (Cellphone chiming) 
 How responsible. 
 Most people wouldn't pull over. 
 Most people wouldn't pick up hitchhikers. 
 I'll be just a sec. We'll get back on the road. 
 I've always been perplexed by the fear of hitchhikers. 
 Sometimes it's nice to have some company on the road. 
 Sometimes it's nice to have a small, meaningful exchange before you part ways. 
 (Gasping, choking) 
 (Grunts of effort) 
 Protege me! 
 (Shouts of surprise) 
 Constringe eum. 
 What is this? 
 A small, meaningful exchange. 
 How do we know we're not walking into another massacre like Rochester? 
 We'll have the tactical advantage. 
 He'll be walking into whatever trap the witches set for him. Are you sure we can trust them? 
 If we want Malcolm, we have no choice. 
 (Vehicle approaching) 
 We have guests. 
 Jeremy : Can I help you? 
 Jeremy Danvers. 
 Eduardo Escobado. 
 I'm from the Spanish Pack and I'm here to find my Alpha. 
 ♪ 
 Rodrigo Sanchez was here a few days ago for the council meeting. 
 If he told you that he was coming here yesterday, then he didn't make it. Or he lied. 
 I think  someone  lied. 
 Maybe him. 
 Maybe you. 
 Oh, you might want to rephrase that. 
 Clay... 
 Our friends are just concerned about their Alpha. 
 In their position, who wouldn't be? 
 My position is that this is the last place Rodrigo had been before he went off the radar. 
 I want to find him. 
 Would you give us a minute, please. 
 Of course. 
 I understand that you're worried. 
 Your Alpha missing, so far from home. 
 I suggest you look in your own ranks first. 
 Our  ranks? This is the house that has seen much death recently. 
 I think that might include my Alpha. 
 Do you have the nerve to say that in front of the council? 
 They'll all be here within a few days. 
 You know how we feel about false accusations. 
 Need a hand? 
 No, I got it. 
 ♪ 
 Every Pack has skeletons in the closet. 
 You have your father. 
 And... where is he? 
 This conversation is over. 
 Fine. 
 You want me to leave? 
 Show me your house. 
 All of it. 
 Eduardo... 
 I don't have to show you anything. 
 Then humor me. 
 Please. 
 I need to go back to them with something. 
 Be my guest. 
 Jeremy : The scent of death still lingers here. 
 Two Mutts were killed in the attack on Stonehaven. 
 Elena was almost killed protecting our Pack and everything down here. 
 There is also the stench of bleach, as if you're trying to cover something up. 
 Elena : There was a lot of carnage. 
 We take pride in our home and everything in it. 
 Have you seen our Legacy? 
 Quite the collection, yes. 
 I may have leapt to a hasty assumption. 
 I've seen everything I need to see. 
 My humble apologies. 
 One can only hope that every Pack member is as loyal to their Alpha as you clearly are to Rodrigo. 
 I wish you best efforts in finding him. 
 If we hear anything, we'll be sure to contact you. 
 Let's finish this. 
 We could just burn Rodrigo here. 
 We should be burning him and Malcolm at the same time. 
 We should've killed Malcolm when we had a chance. 
 We dispose of Rodrigo now, the right way. 
 This  can't  come back on Jeremy. 
 (Car door closing) 
 Woman : He gave me a bit of trouble, but I got him right where I want him. 
 Okay. We'll wait here until you send word you're ready for us. 
 Relax, Malcolm, you're going to hurt yourself. 
 The restraining spell I've got on you is going to make the cage you just escaped seem like a Kleenex box. Are you the creature that attacked me in Rochester? 
 No. 
 But we are going to give you to him. 
 You're just a goat on a chain. 
 And if we need to defend ourselves, trust me, we've got that covered. 
 So, this is what a great werewolf looks like. 
 Quite the specimen. 
 I can see why he wants you. 
 We can work together here, you know, eliminate him. 
 Train you to work with us? 
 Oh, I don't think so. 
 I've seen what he's capable of. 
 You need me. 
 Of course we do. 
 As the bait. 
 Woman : (Muttering) He is the one true path. 
 He's the one true light on the path. 
 The key to our gate. 
 The light we follow through the gate. 
 The key that unlocks us into the great... (Indistinct) 
 Hello? 
 ...The light we follow. 
 The truth we follow... 
 Don't let her bother you. She's not feeling well. 
 Was she the woman that was screaming the other night? 
 No, that was the woman from Rochester. 
 Some pains to do with her pregnancy. 
 But she's fine now. 
 How is the new furniture in your room? 
 Is everything to your liking? 
 No. 
 I'm locked away here. Like I was with Ruth and Paige. 
 It's for your safety. We've been over that. 
 And what power would you like to learn today? 
 Anything you want. Think of something your coven would never teach you. 
 Maybe you could tell me something. 
 I had a strange dream last night. 
 A dream? 
 Tell me about it. 
 There was a man in a barn. 
 I think that's where he's hiding, only... he turns into a wolf. 
 A wolf? 
 A werewolf. 
 And he's very powerful. 
 I think his name was... 
 Martin or... Marshall... 
 Malcolm? 
 That's it. 
 And when you appeared, you were happy. 
 You said that you'd been looking for him. 
 Your vision was very useful. 
 If only we knew where this barn was. 
 There was a sign. I wrote it down. 
 Hm. 
 Thank you for this, Savannah. 
 Is there something else you want to tell me? 
 No. 
 I am the lock. 
 And I'm the key. 
 Don't go alone. 
 Why not? 
 The wolf isn't by himself. 
 That's fine. 
 (Fingers snapping) 
 We'll pick this up again later. 
 Woman : (Muttering)

 ♪ 
 (Eerie music) 
 Elle's voice : (Agonized screams) 
 (Nervous heavy sigh) 
 Hey. 
 Talk to me. 
 Clay, look, I know you. 
 And I know being in Baton Rouge stirred something up. 
 My parents didn't abandon me. 
 None of that's true. 
 Malcolm killed my mother, slaughtered her. 
 My father, he came home, saw it... 
 He took his own life. 
 But after all these years... I was wrong. 
 Malcolm taught me to fight, to kill. 
 I should've used that against him. 
 We had him, Elena. 
 We had him. I could've ripped his throat out. 
 When this thing with the witches is over, we make him pay for what he's done. 
 (Wet thud) 
 This alliance thing... 
 What are we getting ourselves into? 
 They painted us into a corner. 
 Once their witch shows up with Malcolm, they get us everything. 
 I have a bad feeling about this. 
 Ruth : I don't want to hear it. 
 Paige : Fine... 
 Do you want me to admit that I'm scared? 
 I am scared. 
 Paige, we are doing this. 
 We stand down now, Savannah may never come back. 
 I want her back just as much as you do. 
 I was there when he took her. 
 I  didn't protect her. 
 This thing, this Aleister... 
 I will not let our future be dictated this man. 
 He's not just a man. 
 Paige, this is all we have. 
 (Eerie music) 
 ♪ 
 Savannah... are you with us? 
 Savannah's voice :  I'm with you. 
 Savannah. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I gave him the information, just like you wanted. 
 He was happy. You didn't tell him that we can communicate like this? No. I said I had a vision, just like you told me to. Is he coming to the farm? I think so...  It's like a... witchy Skype call or... witch Facetime... Would you listen? Ruth : Savannah, we will bring you home today. It's quiet here now. The woman from Rochester, the one who he told you was screaming... Woman from Rochester? Whoa, whoa, easy, easy! Let them do their thing. Nobody was hurting her. He said that she was in pain because of the baby. That's Rachel. Logan, don't... Logan! (Stammering) - She said something about a pregnant woman. Ask her about that. What about the baby? Ask her where she is! Ruth : - Damn it, get him off her! (Gasping, grunting) Paige, Paige. Paige! Paige, come back to us, Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige? It's all right. (Grunting, groaning) Come back! Come back, Come back, it's okay, Paige. Come back... What happened? Is she okay? You break a channel like that, you risk terrible damage. The woman that Savannah described, it's... it's his girlfriend. She's pregnant? Yeah, just a couple of months. Malcolm had her in Rochester. Aleister must have found her there and brought her to his compound. (Gasping, groaning) Paige! Are you okay? Yeah, it's kind of like a... a gin hangover. Or worse : Schnapps. Ughh... All right, where is she? How do we find her? Look, just because he has your girlfriend doesn't mean we alter the plan. He has Savannah as well. We all want to find out where they are. She's alive. Yes. I knew it. For your mother. For Philip... Pete, Antonio... Malcolm dies today. Let's go. You're planning on putting Malcolm in there? Bridget should be able to hold him with a spell. And when Aleister goes in after him, that's when we'll make our move. We'd better put him right here. There's more places for us to lie in wait, then we can surround them. All right. That's what we'll do. We should be able to contain him. And then we will force him to tell us where his compound is. With spells? By whatever means necessary. We don't like to harm. We don't like to torture. We also don't like having our girls kidnapped. Two ways in; that's not ideal. Means there's two ways out. We'll be ready for them. It'll tell us when he's nearby. Clay mentioned that Aleister's followers are immune to pain. Is that some sort of spell? Not one that I've ever seen. You and I will take a position up on that hill with Nick. We'll move to surround Aleister when he arrives and deal with any followers that come with him. Okay, sounds good. I'm glad she's alive, Logan. First thing we do is we make sure that Aleister does not get away. We deal with Malcolm and then we're going to find Rachel. We are going to bring her home. Okay. (Barn door opening) (Engine stops) Whatever you think of me, whatever I've done to you, let it go and we'll survive this together. But don't let this happen. I prefer you kill me than let me be taken by whatever's coming. You're worth more to all of us alive than dead. For now.
