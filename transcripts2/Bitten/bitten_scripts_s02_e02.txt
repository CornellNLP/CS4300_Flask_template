 Previously on "Bitten"... 
 Clayton : You can't ignore your grief. 
 You have to deal with Philip's death. 
 But his sister has been texting me ever since. 
 Clayton : I was Bitten when I was ten. 
 My family couldn't find me, and eventually they gave up. 
 Malcolm hasn't had any money to speak of, yet he managed an uprising. 
 Do you think someone is backing him? 
 You, my friend, are a weasel. 
 Jeremy, this is a mistake! 
 You financed the Mutt uprising. 
 I'm going to finish now what I should've finished in Stonehaven. 
 Aaaah! 
 Jeremy! 
 She isn't here. 
 Where is Rachel? 
 I suppose if you kill me you'll never find out. 
 Malcolm : Something came at me in Rochester. 
 Clayton : Is that what this is about? 
 You need to keep me alive. For what's coming. 
 Wherever they're taking Malcolm Danvers, is where we're going. 
 Woman : What's troublin' you, Clayton? 
 Aren't you excited to see your daddy? 
 I guess. 
 He's dyin' to see you. 
 He went clear 'round the world to save people in Somalia. 
 Let's give him a hero's welcome. 
 What do you say? 
 (Sigh) 
 You're always gonna be my darlin' little man, Clay. 
 Now and forever. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right, go on. Play. 
 Daddy won't be home for a few hours. 
 Stay clear of the hollows. 
 Those Hog Hunters out there will shoot at anything that moves. 
 ♪ 
 Who are you? 
 I'm... Clayton. 
 Pleasure to meet you, sir. 
 I'm a real hungry man, Clayton. 
 I haven't eaten in days. 
 So this is what I'm proposing: If you run full speed, it'll take you I'm guessing, what, 
 20 minutes to get home? 
 Do you wanna ch-chase me? 
 Tell me, has your hillbilly mom ever butchered a pig? 
 Ah, I thought so. Well... that's what I'm going to do to you. 
 I'm going to start with your stomach, then your lungs... then your heart... everything. 
 I'm going to eat them all up. 
 Are you scared, boy? 
 Good. 
 Adrenaline makes the meat taste good. 
 Run, boy. 
 Run!

 Bitten 2x02 - Sworn Enemies 
(Feb 14, 2015) 
 ♪ 
 Jeremy : Is Logan still down there? 
 Hasn't slept yet. 
 He won't even take a break to eat. 
 Jeremy : Malcolm still hasn't said anything? 
 Nothing. Not a word about where he's keeping Rachel. 
 He's stalling. 
 Every minute he doesn't say anything is another minute that he gets to breathe. 
 (Cellphone buzzing) 
 Is that a problem, Elena? 
 No. 
 Keeping him alive is our best option right now. 
 We finally have him in the cage. 
 I want to kill him so badly. 
 As long as there's the possibility that Rachel is still alive, we have to conduct ourselves as if she is. 
 What about the Alpha council? 
 Either way, this has to be resolved before they get back. 
 If Clay were here, he'd torture it out of him. 
 Malcolm isn't swayed by pain, he enjoys it too much. 
 Everyone's afraid of something. 
 Even the devil. 
 ♪ 
 Clayton : Professor Shayhaus? 
 I'm Clay Danvers, I called earlier. 
 Yes, yes, Dr. Danvers. 
 What can I do for you? 
 I was fascinated by your research on pagan symbology. 
 I came across something recently. 
 I thought you could help me. 
 Happy to help. Pre-Celtic symbols don't get the attention they deserve anymore. 
 (Ominous ♪) 
 Where did you get this? 
 It was scrawled in a house in Upstate New York. 
 With what? What was the medium? 
 Blood. 
 I, uh, don't know what it is. 
 I have a class to teach. 
 Look, it isn't Christian, Egyptian or African. 
 I can't seem to find any reference to it. 
 It's not pagan, okay? 
 I c-can't help you anymore. 
 But you know what it is. 
 What do you know about witchcraft? 
 Wicca? 
 Not Wicca. 
 This has nothing to do with Wicca. 
 This is... "left-hand path", malevolent practice. 
 Look, take my advice, burn that piece of paper and forget you ever saw it. 
 Or don't. Whatever you do, I... I can't get involved. 
 Just point me in the right direction. 
 Zachary, Louisiana. 
 You know it? 
 50 miles North. 
 Find a Miss Yoruba. 
 She'll know what kind of witchcraft that is. 
 I appreciate it. 
 Dr. Danvers. 
 Don't go poking monsters. 
 It's not a good idea. 
 Huh!... 
 I'm not afraid of monsters. 
 You know, it must've been real hard... when Jeremy became Alpha instead of you. 
 Must be tough. 
 Are you going to psychoanalyze me, Logan? 
 Go get some sleep. 
 C'mon. 
 We have to find her. 
 Malcolm : That's right. 
 How long can a pregnant woman survive locked away in a dark hole? 
 Alone and frightened. 
 Without any food or water. 
 You let me walk from Stonehaven in one piece, and you can have her back. 
 We will find her. 
 But on our terms. 
 Get some rest. 
 I'm not... asking you. 
 Don't be a fool. 
 There's too much at stake. 
 You're not walking out of here. 
 Neither are you, if you don't listen to me. 
 There's something coming for us. 
 Jeremy : No one knows we exist. 
 So tell me, what's coming for us? 
 You got in the way before I could find out. 
 But whoever he is, he's strong and he won't stop until he gets what he wants. 
 This won't save you. 
 Whatever you're trying here. 
 Are you willing to sacrifice a werewolf child? 
 The first born in a generation to your Pack. 
 I've never known you to negotiate. 
 What does that tell you? 
 It tells me that you're afraid. 
 And I'm enjoying that.

 Hello? 
 Miss Yoruba?

 (Chickens cackling) 
 (Snort) 
 Are you sure you want to do this? 
 Yeah. 
 (Car door opening) 
 Jeremy : It's the right thing to do. 
 Thank you for calling me, Jeremy. 
 I want to make sure our bad blood is under the bridge, as you say. 
 We found Malcolm. 
 Where is his body? 
 He's in our cage. 
 He's still alive? 
 Allow me to kill him. 
 Our Packs will be bound together, a united front at the council. 
 No one will dare go against us. 
 Well, we haven't forgotten that you backed Malcolm in the first place. 
 You spared my life, of course I... 
 I defer to you, Jeremy. 
 Come inside, Rodrigo.

 You've come to your senses? 
 As a matter of fact, I have.

 Malcolm : Rodrigo, I need to talk to the Alpha council. 
 They have already decided. They want your head. 
 This is not about me, this is about all of us. 
 Rodrigo : There is no "us", Malcolm. 
 You're finished. 
 I don't want you pulling me down with you. 
 Rodrigo is here to see the repercussions of treachery. 
 So that it doesn't happen again. 
 It won't, I assure you. 
 There's a way to guarantee that. 
 Is there anything you want to say before I kill you, Malcolm? 
 You always were an idiot, Rodrigo. 
 (Flesh ripping) 
 (Gagging) 
 There is no cavalry to save you. 
 Where is she? 
 If I tell you, you will kill me.

 Doesn't look like much, but it sure as sh1t ain't open to the public. 
 A long time ago, maybe 20 years, a family lived here. 
 Yeah, a Marine. 
 He was over in Somalia. 
 I let him park his home here. 
 Least I could do to support my country. 
 Had a wife and kid. 
 Elle, she was a peach. 
 And the boy... 
 Ken or Clem?... 
 Clay. 
 That's right. Wait... you knew them? 
 Maybe you have a number, a relative, or just a way to get a hold of them. 
 Son, the only place you're going to find that family is in the cemetery at the edge of town. 
 Elle was attacked by a wolf. 
 Elle got killed right where you're standing. 
 Th-that brown spot, that's her blood. 
 We all went searching, but we never did find the boy's body. 
 And the Marine? Shoot, he come home that night from the war, the whole family gone. 
 Didn't take too long till he took a pistol, put it in his mouth, and joined them in the great beyond. 
 Who did you say you was again? 
 Nobody, I'm nobody. Thanks.

 Jeremy didn't find a single trace of them. 
 I don't like how they just showed up and then disappeared like we hallucinated the whole thing. 
 Whatever it was, I think they were trying to get to Malcolm. 
 It can't be ghosts, because... 
 You know I... I don't believe in ghosts. 
 Neither do you. 
 Right? 
 There was a time if you told me werewolves existed, I would've laughed. 
 I don't laugh at much anymore. 
 That's not reassuring. 
 You're not going out there? 
 I don't have a choice. 
 Philip's sister is here? 
 In Bear Valley. 
 Whatever Philip told her... 
 Jorge cleaned everything! 
 There's nothing that traces back to you, or us, or any of Malcolm's associates. 
 As far as the world is concerned, Philip died in a car accident. 
 Yeah, but his sister is here. 
 Do you really want her driving up to the front door? 
 Hey, if you see any strange women with white eyes, run them over. 
 ♪ 
 Malcolm : I don't know what happened out there. 
 I'm in here. 
 What happened to your men in Rochester? 
 At first I thought it was you coming at us. 
 They were human, except for one thing. 
 They didn't feel any pain. 
 Where's Rachel? 
 I had her safely tucked away before the attack. 
 After, well... 
 Let's just say now I have bigger worries. 
 There are dark forces at work. 
 Forces we never believed could exist, but they do. 
 Clayton : Witchcraft. 
 I found what you were looking for. 
 That woman you killed had it hidden away. 
 That symbol is in here. 
 She died protecting that book. 
 You have to understand them to fight them. 
 That book is the key. 
 Give it to me.

 Hi. 
 (Sniffling) 
 (Clearing throat) 
 I am so sorry. 
 I couldn't... 
 I couldn't bring myself to come to his funeral. 
 I've been trying to figure out where it all went wrong. 
 Philip started acting jealous, ranting about how you were part of some crime family. 
 At first I thought: nervous breakdown. 
 And then he was stabbed in his own apartment. 
 Just tell me straight, Elena. 
 Did Clay do that? 
 What? 
 No, no, Clay would not do that. 
 He tried to protect Philip. 
 You got my brother mixed up into something. 
 And now he's dead. 
 ♪ 
 Philip wasn't having a nervous breakdown. 
 When he had his accident, he was racing to the airport to meet me. 
 We were going to fly to France together. 
 There were some very bad people after me. 
 You're a photographer, Elena. 
 You're not a mobster. 
 It's because of my family. 
 There is a darkness there. 
 Death, and... and murder. 
 And I was a part of it. 
 I tried to run. 
 I tried to start a new life. 
 And your brother, you, your entire family were my lifeline. 
 He was going to save me from my past. 
 He couldn't. 
 Because it came and found me. 
 You should've gone to the police, Elena. 
 No. Listen to me. 
 In the end, Philip understood he couldn't do that, it wasn't possible. 
 It's why we decided to run. 
 I have spent the last week lashing out at everything around me, trying to find someone to blame for his death. 
 And I figured out who's responsible. 
 It's me. 
 It is my fault. 
 I could not do the one thing that would've saved his life. 
 I couldn't leave him. 
 If I'd just left him, he'd have a broken heart but he would still be alive. 
 Philip wasn't prepared for the evil that came into his life... 
 Me. 
 Did you ever really love him? 
 I thought I did. 
 It wasn't enough. I'm sorry. 
 I don't know you. 
 Diane... 
 I don't want to know you. 
 Diane... 
 Don't worry, I'm not going to go to the police. 
 What the hell would I tell them, anyway? 
 My best friend was a criminal. 
 What kind? I don't know, she won't say. 
 You have every right to hate me. 
 (Sniffling) 
 So much hurt. 
 For what? 
 Money? Power? 
 What is it you people fight for? 
 Right now... revenge.

 Don't ever contact me or my family again. 
 And I'll return the favour.

 Can't believe we summoned witches. 
 Woman : You didn't summon us. 
 We came because it's time to talk. 
 Oh, and you left your front door unlocked. 
 We heard you in there: "veni ad me". 
 It's too bad that we know way more about you than you know about us. 
 Seems you have us at a disadvantage, then. 
 Again, more than you know.

 My associate, Paige. 
 You'll forgive me if I'm not familiar with the protocols dealing with your type. 
 We're witches. You can say it. 
 It's not a word we like to use in unsafe company, but with you, it's fine since you're both from the Other World. 
 "The Other World"? 
 Ruth : Not human. 
 Supernatural. 
 You might prefer "special". 
 Magic, as you might call it, does exist. 
 We don't fly around on broomsticks or twitch our noses to cast spells. 
 I run a successful cosmetic company. 
 Wholly organic, of course. 
 We have more in common than you think. 
 We both need to keep our existence a secret. 
 People panic at the thought of us. 
 Always have, always will. 
 I have no interest in exposing you... or us. 
 You're all women, I take it? 
 Our power is hereditary, like yours. 
 But unlike you, we only give birth to female children. 
 How do you know so much about us? 
 We... keep tabs, but we don't intervene in your affairs. 
 "Live and let live" is our motto. 
 Yet here you are. 
 In my home. 
 Calling us out into the woods. 
 Were you responsible for what happened in Rochester? 
 All we saw was the aftermath. 
 The man that did that knows we exist. 
 All of us. 
 We're being hunted. 
 They want the werewolf that you have downstairs. 
 And so do we. 
 (Door opening) 
 If you're sneaking in, you must have vengeance on your mind. 
 Why did you kill Philip? 
 You set him up just to kill him. 
 Why? Just to be a sadistic son of a bitch? 
 You needed to know who's boss. 
 You are not in control. 
 You never were. 
 Not me. 
 Your nature is in control. 
 Like it or not, you're a werewolf. 
 You are bound to our ways by your biology and it will not be denied. 
 Do you still have that silly dream of living in Toronto? 
 It's so terribly mundane and superficial. 
 Do you feel it? 
 The rage? The lust? 
 It is your power. 
 You can thank me, Elena, 
 'cause I gave you the greatest gift of all: your true self. 
 You are now all wolf. 
 You are our future. 
 I just want to put you in the past. 
 Ruth : You want him dead. 
 We want to trade him. 
 For what? 
 For a young girl. 
 A young witch who hasn't yet come into her powers. 
 She can't defend herself. 
 She was kidnapped by this force. 
 Look, all you need to know is that we want her back. 
 Help us. 
 Please. 
 You want Malcolm. 
 But I can't turn him over. 
 ♪ 
 You think brute force will be enough. 
 Well, it won't be. 
 Soon they will come for you and you will be begging for our help. 
 I doubt that. 
 Doubt all you like, but let me tell you this. 
 We've managed to survive a long time... much longer than you, I might add... and we didn't do it by playing nice. 
 You're either on our side or you're in our way. 
 Right now, you're in our way. 
 I've been waiting for this long enough. 
 That's right. 
 Feel it in your veins, in your blood.

 You have to die! 
 Take her upstairs.

 Malcolm : You see that, Clay? 
 She's got fight in her. 
 She's better than all of you put together. 
 You want to see fight?

 Tale of the woman eaten alive in her trailer by a wolf? 
 Crying for her son as I tore her to bits?

 Hey... Hey, it's okay. I'm here now. 
 You were right, Clay.

 All of these plans that we make, formulating strategies, guiding our futures through Machiavellian means. 
 All designed to get us what we want. 
 You never did have the stomach for that. 
 Much to my eternal shame. 
 Your design was interrupted, though. 
 You couldn't have foreseen that you'd be flushed out of that hole in Rochester by an unknown force. 
 That wasn't part of your plan. 
 As usual, you struggle to make a point. 
 (Chuckle) 
 You don't have her. 
 You have no idea where she is. 
 And your last bargaining chip is off the table. 
 You will not survive what's coming. 
 Yeah. 
 Whatever is out there, these witches, whoever knows about us, I will deal with them for the protection of my Pack. 
 My family. 
 And you will not be around to see it.

 You okay? 
 Yeah.

 (Stammering) You... you heard those witches. 
 That guy that came after Malcolm... 
 She-she was in that house. 
 I mean, if he wanted a werewolf, maybe, maybe... maybe he took her. 
 If we're going to believe the witches, we have to believe what they say, that he wants Malcolm. 
 You're asking me to give up hope. 
 I'm asking you to brace yourself for the worst. 
 You would've made a great dad, Logan. 
 You need to heal. 
 We all do. 
 I want you to stop running. 
 This is your home and we are your family. 
 And we will help you get through this.
