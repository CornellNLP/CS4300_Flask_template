 Previously, on "Bitten"... 
 You're always going to be my little man, Clay. 
 Man : You have to understand them to fight them. 
 That book is the key. 
 Elena? 
 You're going to die. 
 Savannah : I keep having this vision that you're getting killed. 
 A premonition of something that will happen. 
 Aleister is there, too. 
 Elena : Aleister is dead. 
 By the end of the day, you will kill Roman Navikev. 
 I'm not going to kill the Russian Alpha and start a war because you threatened me? 
 Elena : But at Aleister's compound, when you were angry, you had trouble controlling your power. 
 (Screaming) 
 Eduardo, he's in the forest. 
 Get him. 
 I'm on it. 
 (Groaning) 
 (Grunt) 
 You're chasing the wrong enemy. 
 Clay : We killed you! 
 Aleister : With your help, I'll get what I need. 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Woman : (Incantation in foreign language) 
 (Mixed eerie whispers) 
 Enjoy the heart attack, Charlie. 
 Ruth : Clara, stop! 
 This isn't what it looks like, Ruthie. 
 Then what? 
 Because it looks like you're killing people. 
 Look, I need the money. All right? 
 Trust me, these guys are no saints. 
 You crossed a line, Clara. 
 Please... Please. Ruth... 
 I'll go back to the ways of the Coven. 
 I'll serve you. Whatever you want. 
 This is not a negotiation. 
 (Screaming) 
 Amoletum ad pulverem. 
 (Eerie music) 
 (Gasping) 
 You'll pay for this. 
 (Panting) 
 Aleister : All is not as it may seem on the surface. 
 It is what's inside of you that is the truth. 
 But, it's your essence, your history, your future. 
 Every drop you have moves through your whole body in a minute. 
 (Gasping) 
 (Mixed murmurs of crowd) 
 You don't want to lose any of it. 
 (Applause) 
 Clara : Timothy! 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 Who are you? 
 I'm the reason you're alive. 
 Then you must know what I am. 
 You're the prophecy.

 ( ♪ ) 
 Jeremy : (distant) Clay! 
 Jeremy : Clay! 
 (Groaning) 
 Clay! 
 Where have you been? 
 Been looking all over for you. 
 I was attacked. 
 By Eduardo? 
 Yeah. He set a trap. 
 You okay? 
 I just came to. 
 Don't worry, we'll hit him back twice as hard, okay? 
 I'm sorry, Jeremy. 
 Maybe we can still find him. 
 He's probably halfway back to Spain by now. 
 Let's get you back to Stonehaven and I'll take a look at that. 
 Roman will want to know that Eduardo's still on the loose. 
 Call him. 
 (Ominous music) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 (Regular breathing) 
 What happened? 
 Did Savannah do this too? 
 Savannah had nothing to do with that. 
 She bled a man out, yesterday. 
 There's no telling what she'll do next. 
 We'll be gone soon. But you just got here. 
 We need to bring Savannah home for her Initiation ritual. 
 She needs her talisman to focus her powers. 
 So that something terrible like last night doesn't happen again. 
 Why go all the way back to Boston? 
 Do your ritual here. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 We've imposed enough. 
 Well if she is dangerous, you should do it as soon as possible. 
 He's right. 
 We shouldn't take the chance. 
 How quickly can it be done? 
 We should be out by night fall.

 Jeremy?

 (Banging) 
 (Rattle of doorknob) 
 Aleister : You werewolves are full of surprises. 
 Clay : What are you doing here? 
 I could ask you the same thing. 
 (Yelling) 
 Aleister : Do you even know where "here" is? 
 Stonehaven. 
 Stonehaven of sorts. 
 The one inside your mind, your subconscious. 
 (Banging) 
 A great woman taught me this spell. 
 I've taken possession of your body. 
 Out there, in the real world, they think I'm you. 
 No, I'm right here. 
 You see, that is what's surprising. 
 Your consciousness should already be dead. 
 Gone from here. 
 You are quite the fighter. 
 You haven't even begun to see me fight! 
 You don't have any control over your body. 
 I do. I have you locked away inside your mind. 
 There is no way out. 
 Oh, no, no, Elena will know you're not me. 
 By the time I'm done with your body, I'll have broken that bitch's heart. 
 Not before she rips out yours. 
 You mean  yours. 
 It's your body. 
 I only need it until I get back to mine. 
 (Banging) 
 And you'll be dead. 
 Once Savannah has her talisman, I'll take her. 
 We have some unfinished business. 
 (Growling) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Banging) 
 (Banging) 
 Elena : You ready to go, Savannah? 
 You almost packed? 
 Elena? 
 Ruth is pretty upset, huh? 
 And you? 
 I didn't kill that man. 
 Or if I did, I... I didn't mean to. 
 Savannah. 
 It's okay, I'm not judging you. 
 Of course. 
 You pack light. 
 Story of my life. 
 What does that mean? 
 I have this Altar Vessel at home and I'm just supposed to fill it with stuff. 
 Things that will... you know, give me courage during the Initiation. And... 
 So far it's pretty empty. 
 Before all of this craziness, I was a photographer. 
 Take this. 
 It's one of my favorites. 
 A reminder that we're more than just wolves and witches. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 (Door opens) 
 Elena : You're back. I was getting worried. 
 Clay, you're hurt! 
 I'm fine. 
 You should come downstairs. 
 Ruth has some good news.

 With this anointment, the Initiation begins. 
 We call upon all those on the nexus and we humbly request their powers as we initiate Savannah Levine. 
 Go ahead. 
 (Roar of fire) 
 You initiate through fire as your catalytic element. 
 (Nervous sigh) 
 (Muffled scratching and squeaks) 
 Oh my God, they're in the walls. 
 They're not in the walls. 
 It's just an echo of the card. 
 It's fine, Savannah. 
 You've chosen a great familiar. 
 Paige, I am  terrified  of rats. 
 They are clever, alert, intuitive... 
 I'm just going to chose another card. 
 No, Savannah... 
 It's been chosen. 
 I want to have Elena with me. 
 No. 
 The Initiation only works if you meet your familiar alone. 
 But for the first part, can she be with me then? 
 Savannah... 
 She can be with you at the first part. 
 But when you go in, you must do it alone. 
 Do you understand? 
 She needs an Altar Vessel with her when she's alone on her ritual. 
 Poor kid has nothing here. 
 Why do you want any part in this ritual? 
 If it helps, what harm can it do? 
 Can I borrow this? 
 No. 
 I... It's too fragile. 
 Shouldn't be out in the woods. 
 You must have something. 
 Survey maps? 
 You building us a little cottage? 
 Right now, I'm more worried about you. 
 Savannah is a dangerous kid. 
 Until she has her talisman, you should steer clear. 
 She means a lot to me, you know that. 
 Of course. 
 (Ominous music) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 I'm going to go look for a vessel for Savannah. 
 I'm sure Jeremy has something. 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Hey. Can I help? 
 Need a match? 
 A match isn't the right fire for the Initiation. 
 We need four of the nine sacred woods. 
 Luckily, they're not that hard to find around here. 
 You've got oak, ash, birch... 
 ...and alder. 
 Ah. Alder, of course. Yes. 
 You know, wolves have rituals too. 
 I can't seem to stay away from you. 
 Mmmm... 
 (Light blowing) 
 Nick : I miss the feel of you.

 We don't have time for this.

 Ruth : I know it seems strange, but this component of the ritual has to be done alone. 
 Whatever it takes, I'm here to help. 
 Nick : Why are you building this all the way out here? 
 Jeremy wanted it in the back field, closer to the house. 
 If they need solitude, I thought this is where they'll find it. 
 Well, Jeremy won't like it. 
 We have to rebuild this in the right place. 
 This is the right place. 
 We don't want to cause trouble. 
 It's no trouble, I'll just move it for you. 
 Leave it. 
 Hmm, somebody's been dipping their wick. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 She's nothing but a little witch whore. 
 You're out of line right now. 
 Apologize to her. 
 (Grunting) 
 What are you doing? 
 Kicking your ass. 
 (Fighting grunts) 
 Oh, stop it! 
 (Groans, grunts) 
 Stop it! 
 Nick. Nick. Enough. Enough. 
 Enough! 
 (Panting) 
 Elena : Are you crazy? 
 Fighting Nick? 
 It's the witches. 
 They're tearing us apart. I won't let that happen. 
 Listen to yourself. 
 This isn't you. 
 You're right. 
 This  is me. 
 Clay, no. Stop. 
 (Grunting) 
 What are you...? 
 Stop it, what's wrong with you? 
 Both : (Effort grunts) 
 (Groan) 
 (Door slam) 
 Elena! 
 (Distant banging) 
 Hello? 
 (Indistinct, echoing voice) 
 
 
 
 (Knocking on door) 
 I count on you to help me keep this Pack together, not tear it apart. 
 What happened between you and Nick? 
 It was a misunderstanding. 
 About what? 
 The witches. 
 I was wrong about letting them stay here. 
 They'll be gone in a few hours. 
 And then what happens? 
 We go back to the way things were, Clay. 
 Elena's feelings for that girl are a problem. 
 She wants to protect her. She's obsessed. 
 I have faith in Elena's ability to put the Pack first. 
 There are things you don't know. 
 About Elena. 
 About what happened at the compound. 
 (Ominous music) 
 It's a lovely dress. Where'd you get it? 
 Oh, it was from Paige. 
 She said I could keep it after. 
 Ruth and Paige, they... they care a lot about you. 
 Savannah, you look great. 
 Thanks. 
 Do you, um... do you guys think I'm ready? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Well, we can't delay. 
 I'll get my things. 
 Paige. 
 Before we go... 
 I have to ask you... 
 The way that Savannah can't control her magic, is that normal? 
 It's a powerful force. 
 She's like a grenade with the pin pulled. 
 You throw it in the right direction, everything's okay. 
 And if not... 
 But how out-of-control can it get? 
 Can it affect other people? 
 Why? What's going on? 
 Clay : At the compound, she was... forced to Change. 
 In front of people. It's really thrown her. 
 That's an incredible violation. 
 But she never has to see those people again. 
 And they will not remember seeing her. 
 One will. 
 One of them was Rachel. 
 Elena never told me that. 
 She didn't? 
 Why would she keep it a secret if it wasn't troubling her? 
 I think this relationship with Savannah, she's... she's trying to find the good in what happened. 
 And you're worried that the more time she spends with this girl... the harder it will be for her to deal with what's really wrong. 
 The ceremony only deepens their bond. 
 It's your decision, Jeremy. I only thought you should know. 
 I'll deal with it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Door closing) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Elena : There's something different about Clay. 
 He's angry. Aggressive with me. 
 It's like he's someone else. 
 Aleister messed with my mind in the compound. 
 Maybe he taught that to Savannah. 
 And you think that Savannah has something to do with it? 
 That Clay's under some type of spell? 
 No, it's different than what happened to me. 
 It's like... he's not himself. 
 Look, I get it. 
 You realize that magic exists, and that spells can be real, and when something weird happens, you think that that's the reason. 
 But most often there's a simple explanation. 
 He loves you, Elena. 
 And if there's something wrong with Clay, you should talk to Clay. 
 Not me.

 Malcolm : (Echoing) You're right here, Clayton. 
 You're dead. 
 We burned your body. 
 Yet here I am, Clayton. 
 Can't get rid of me that easy. 
 (Metal clanging in distance) 
 (Panting) 
 (Grunts of effort) 
 (Door rattling) 
 Young Clay : It's no use. 
 (Frustrated growl) 
 We're trapped here. 
 You're not here. 
 This is not real. 
 I still live in you, just like the boy does. 
 Argh! 
 Stop. 
 You can't fight strong anymore. 
 You want a way out of here, fight smart. 
 All these years of teaching you how to battle; we're back to square one, boy. 
 He's taken control of my body, trapped my mind. 
 I need a way out. 
 Or else we'll die. 
 (Shaky breath) 
 Elena, we need to talk. 
 Look, Jeremy, I-I didn't know how to bring it up, but it's Clay. 
 He's not himself. 
 And look, this is the book that Clay found in Baton Rouge, right? 
 And this section talks about how a... a dark witch can enter someone else's body and control it. 
 You think that someone's possessed Clay? 
 Clay told me what you were forced to do at the compound. I know. 
 What? 
 He said that they made you Change in front of others. In front of Rachel. 
 I never... I never told Clay about that. 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean, the only people who know about my Change at the compound are me and Rachel... 
 And Aleister. 
 Elena, Aleister is dead. 
 Paige and Nick burned his body and buried the ashes. 
 No, Jeremy, I am telling you, that is not the Clay that I know. 
 Okay? 
 Where's Clay right now? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Where was he this morning when this all started? 
 I found him in one of the storage shacks on the edge of the property. 
 Which one? Can you show me? 
 Yes. 
 We have to do it now. 
 But Elena said she'd be here. 
 I'm sure she has her reasons, but we've already started the ritual, Savannah, we can't take any longer. 
 You can do this. 
 You don't need anyone. 
 Just remember what you are and where you belong.

 Aleister. We found his symbol in a shack on the property. 
 But he's dead. 
 We think that Aleister's still alive... and that he has possessed Clay to take Savannah. 
 We have to find Aleister's body. 
 He's going to try and kill Clay within a dark circle that he's drawn on the floor. 
 If you can kill Clay's body outside the circle, it will trap Aleister's spirit and he'll die. 
 H... h... how do we kill the body and not hurt Clay? 
 You can't. 
 Ruth, there has to be a way. 
 Believe me, if there was another way, we would be doing it. 
 This is a very, very dark magic. 
 There's no coming back from it. 
 Possession spells are always fatal to those possessed. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I am not giving up on Clay! 
 Listen to me, Jeremy. 
 The man you love is already gone. 
 Clay is already dead. 
 No one can bring him back. 
 You're asking me to kill my son, Ruth. 
 I have no idea the hell you are about to go through.

 Gone. 
 I checked his room. 
 I found these. 
 Survey maps. 
 Nick : He cut out this corner. 
 Looks like he took it with him. 
 There's an old foundry right down that road. 
 That's where he's going to draw the dark circle. 
 Elena : Jeremy, did Ruth tell you how we get Clay back? 
 We have to find him fast. 
 (Metallic banging) 
 (Banging continues) 
 (Hinges creaking) 
 (Banging continues) 
 You're afraid of what you'll find.

 Clay : Descending stairs into darkness... a dream that means death. 
 It's the only way out. 
 (Banging) 
 Don't go. 
 There's no room for fear. 
 What's down there, let it tear down the walls, let it set you free. 
 (Banging continues) 
 (Footfalls echoing) 
 Ugh! 
 His scent is here, but it's weak. 
 We need to split up. How do we stop him? 
 I don't want either of you to do what needs to be done. 
 Find him and I'll finish this. 
 Hey. Jeremy, what aren't you telling us? 
 (Sigh) 
 You're hiding something from us, I can see it. 
 Clay... as we know him, is gone. 
 What do you mean? 
 The possession spell is fatal. 
 Ruth made it very clear, it's dark magic. 
 When Aleister took over his body, he destroyed Clay's soul. 
 No. No, I don't believe her. 
 Jeremy : If there was any other option, we'd be taking it. 
 He's gone. And the only way for us to stop Aleister now is to kill Clay. 
 Jeremy, that is not going to happen. 
 What if we find Aleister's body and just kill it instead? 
 It's not going to bring Clay back. 
 That would just lock Aleister in Clay's body forever. 
 Then we do that. 
 We trap him, we hold him in the cage, and we wait. 
 Clay's strong, Jeremy, he can fight this, okay? 
 I know he can! He will! 
 It's not going to be Clay in that cage. 
 And you're going to wait for the rest of your life, but he's gone, Elena. 
 Clay's dead... and we have to accept that. 
 We've lost him and I'm sorry. 
 Stay here, I will deal with this alone. 
 Nick : - No. 
 If Aleister killed my brother, then he needs to die. 
 You tell me how. 
 If you find him, you take him out of the circle he's in and you finish him there. 
 That's what you do. 
 And that is the only way we avenge what happened to Clay. 
 I don't know if I can do this, Nick. 
 You just stick with me and you won't have to. 
 Come on. 
 Ruth : For those who have come before us, find and protect our Coven witch.
