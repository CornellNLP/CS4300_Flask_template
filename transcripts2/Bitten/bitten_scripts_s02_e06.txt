 (Gasp) 
 You can change right now or you can be responsible for this lady's death. 
 Elena : (Screaming) 
 Ruth : Clara Sullivan was one of our brightest witches. 
 She always had a dark side. 
 What have you gotten us into? 
 You got us into it. He's out there, isn't he? 
 He's about to kill you. The prophecy. 
 Aleister is going to cast a spell to kill all witches. 
 He wants to inject my blood into you. 
 Ding-dong, the witch is dead. 
 Savannah, can I talk to Ruth through you? 
 This is Elena. We're somewhere in Quebec. 
 I think it's some type of former military base. No! I'm going to need you to do whatever possible to help us identify that compound. When were you going to tell Paige the truth? That Aleister is your son? Savannah : (Screaming) Let me go! Let your fear go. Send it out to her. (Speaking foreign language) Aleister : You are all-powerful. Today, you are a full witch. ( ♪ ) (Music continues on radio) ( ♪ ) ♪ Everywhere you go you're in a microscope ♪ 
♪ You're living in a fish bowl ♪ 
♪ And your mind's under control ♪ (Door bell ringing repeatedly) ♪ Say a prayer for... (Doorbell continues ringing) Ruth? What are you doing here? I was on my way back to Boston. You're the only Coven member within 50 miles. I didn't know where else to go. I need your help. My water broke. Get inside. (Panting, whimpering) (Screaming) Three minutes. Breathe, Ruth! Focus on that and breathe. (Panicked breathing) Do you remember the ataraxia spell? Use it. (Wailing) Ruth : (Indistinct chanting) Clara? Clara : (Gasping) Push, Ruth! Push! (Screaming) Keep pushing! Keep pushing! Keep pushing! You can do it, okay? Okay... (Screaming) (Baby crying) Why won't you show her to me? Ruth, there's a problem with the baby. What? It's a boy. No, that's impossible. (Whimpering, panting) Oh, this is rich. Ruth Winterbourne, next in line for Coven leader, gives birth to a male child. You're going to fix this. You're going to get rid of it. Think again. This is your problem, Ruth. (Baby crying) How many spells have you sold? You wouldn't. The Coven will crush your talisman. You'll be stripped of everything. You're going to tell the Coven that it was a stillborn. But first... you're going to get rid of my mistake. (Groan) What do you want me to do? You know what you have to do. (Baby's cries continue) ( ♪ ) (Baby cooing) (Sigh) ( ♪ ) (Baby fussing) ( ♪ ) Bitten 2x06 - Nine Circles 
Original air date: 03/14/2015 Logan? Logan. Where am I? You all right? They injected me with someone's blood. Did they inject you with Elena's blood? Would that turn me into a wolf? I saw her, Logan! He forced me to watch Elena. She became a wolf! I could've run but I came back for you, so just be honest! You're one of them, aren't you. Baby, listen. I don't know what kind of drugs they gave you... Don't lie. I deserve better. I deserve the truth. I deserved it from the beginning. Two years we were together! Two years that I loved you, and it's two years that you loved me back. And the baby? What am I pregnant with? Listen, our child will have plenty of years of being normal before... Normal? And then what? And then he becomes like his father. A werewolf. Why didn't you tell me? How am I going to explain that to you without you thinking I'm insane? How do I tell anybody that? What would you have me do? (Incredulous laugh) We're going to get out of here. And when we do, I want you to walk away from me. ( ♪ ) (Grunting) (Rattling) One more try. I can't. Picture your hand on top. Feel the cool metal on your palm. Close your eyes. (Deep breath) Ugh. (Indistinct whispering voices) Oh, I can't, I'm sorry. This is a great and ancient power you and I possess. Without the talisman, I can't connect to the Coven. For the longest time, I didn't have one either. I survived. So will you. It's another way for your Coven to control you. They love me. Elena even said so. I am the lock. And I am the key. (Mixed whispering voices) Good. Then why are you distracted? Is Elena okay? What makes you think she isn't? I can just... feel her. Something's not right. I don't want anything bad to happen to her. Elena has no influence on you. You will forget what she said. She is no longer in your mind. They want to control me. (Fingers snapping) (Gasp) (Thud outside) (Keys jingling, lock clicking) If you tear your bed apart, you'll just have to sleep on the floor. What do you care? I don't. But Savannah is a sensitive girl. And for some reason she's grown attached to you. She can feel you from across the compound and I need her to concentrate. For what? The Undoing. I want her to be calm which requires  you  to be calm. You're losing control. If she can sense me, then she knows that I won't let you go through with it. (Speaking in foreign language) (Panting) ( ♪ ) You werewolves are such an... interesting species. (Laboured breathing) I wish I could spend more time figuring out which spells work on you and which don't. The most powerful werewolf... I'm not the most powerful. I didn't know how powerful  I  was until someone showed me. The only male witch. The only female werewolf. We have so much in common. We have nothing in common. I wonder what it would take to break you? Maybe you need to break yourself. (Whimpering) Novem tibi orbibus. (Eerie music) It will all soon be over. Enjoy your day. (Lock clicking) ( ♪ ) (Pained groaning) (Engine shuts off) There are 3,000 acres of forest and 10 access roads. Even as a wolf I couldn't search all this in time. We can find some locals. Maybe they know where it is. The nearest town is 20 miles away. We're running out of time, I can feel it. Savannah's passed into womanhood, it's like static electricity in the air. Can you follow it to her? That would be like chasing a thunderstorm. ( ♪ ) (Groan) (Panting) (Metallic ringing) (Grunting) (Church bells tolling) Not again. Something's happening. There's going to be another ritual. There's got to be some kind of way to get out of here. What if we're the ritual? Wh... Like what? All the tests they've been doing on me. They don't care about me, it's the baby they're after! Logan, what if they want to take him? Hey. Look at me. That's not going to happen, all right? I'm not joking, I'm losing my mind. I don't want to die down here. (Electricity crackling) (Grunt) What's that? Logan : Guess I clipped a wire. Sh... (Coughing) Oh, god... Both : (Coughing) (Grunting) ( ♪ ) (Metallic ringing) (Suspenseful music) (Distant door slam, footsteps) (Panting) (Door opening) (Crunching, snapping) (Gurgling) (Electricity buzzing) (Gasp) (Heavy breathing) (Gasping, panting) ( ♪ ) (Gasping, whimpering) (Muffled screaming) You witches with your talk of communing with nature,  you don't know enough not to wear heels in the forest. It's not like I had time to stop at a shoe store. We have worse to face too, you know, like whether or not we're all going to die. You're not going to slow me down. I'm not stopping. I'm going to find Elena. Don't be such a meathead. You need me with you. Elena will signal. That is all I need. What if she can't signal us? She will! You know, your confidence in her is really sweet, but still. What if. Anyone who uses magic, if we're close enough, I can spot them with this. You need me with you. Keep up or I drag you by the hair. Rachel : I can't breathe. (Wheezing, coughing) Logan : Stay close to the holes in the door. Rachel : (Wheezing) (Coughing) (Electronic beep) Your bra. Take it off! You kidding me? Come on. What are you doing? I need the wire! The wire in your bra, give it to me. We're going to get out of here. (Coughing, gasping) (Groaning) Clay : Elena. I'm here, darling. You're safe. Clay, how did you find me? There's no place in this world you can go where I won't find you. Where are the others? Jeremy? It's just us. You and me. The way it's supposed to be. I have to go... No, no. The first time I saw you... I knew every part of me belonged to you. Clay... I bit you so you could have it all. (Eerie music) ( ♪ ) (Screaming) (Gasping, wheezing) (Panting) (Coughing) ( ♪ ) (Electronic beeps) Come on... (Coughing) (Electricity sparks) Can you walk? I can run. All right. Did you see anything? Maybe. I saw a glint in the east, deeper into the forest. But it was quick and then it was gone. Was it magic? Oh, it was something. Tell me exactly where. Why, what are you going to do? Run around like a bloodhound sniffing for who-knows-what? I don't think your attitude's very cute. Save it for Nick. I'm saying that we can make it there in 20 minutes. I saw power lines, which means an access road. I can find it on the map. (Sighing) What do you think? I've never had... anything... like this before. Well, isn't it time? Everything is ready. Everyone is here to celebrate you, Savannah. Today, you can use your powers. Today is the day of the Undoing. (Sighing) I wish Elena could see it. ( ♪ ) Savannah! (Distant growling) (Growling) Diane? My brother, he's dead because of you! And now so am I. (Groaning) I am coming for you. Diane : (Grunting) (Shaky breathing) You... did this, Elena. And you will pay! Diane : (Shouting) You did this, Elena! And you will pay! You will pay! You will pay. You... will... pay! (Suspenseful music) ( ♪ ) Elena : (Panting) (Door slam) (Footsteps) Over here. Various : (Groaning, grunting) ( ♪ ) Ahh! (Effort grunts) (Gurgling) Ah! ( ♪ ) 
 
 Savannah? Elena, are you okay? How do I know you're real? What do you mean? Okay, of course I'm... real. I felt you were in trouble. I got away from Aleister. He did something to me. Messing with my mind. Savannah : I know. We need to get out of here. Follow me, I... I know the way. Jeremy said they found the other military base 200 miles away. There's nothing there. Buildings have been knocked to the ground years ago. It's quiet. It's got to be somewhere around here. Hidden military bases aren't supposed to be easy to find. If I could, I would, but I can't fly around looking for red roofs and lavender. What type of signal are we looking for, anyway? Whatever it is, it better be big. (Sighing) I can't take the waiting. You really do love her, don't you. More than you can imagine. When I was a little girl, I was taught how to be alone. How to stay alone, how to be happy alone. I thought that way, once. Not anymore. There was a boy, when I was 13. He lived on my street. His name was Jeff. Is there a more boring name than that? "Jeff"? He was quiet. Shy. Never really said a word to me. And then one day I found this ribbon for my hair in the mailbox. And then another one, and then one every single week. They were beautiful ribbons. And I'd wear them and I'd walk down the street and I would see Jeff and he'd be smiling at me. And then I felt like I was going crazy 'cause all I could think about was the... boring kid. On the boring street. And then I got this. Became a witch. Didn't have any more time for boys who wanted to buy me ribbons for my hair. I made a choice. When it happens, you don't get a choice. You never want to be alone again. I have my mother. My Coven. I am not alone. Let's get going, Romeo. We will find her. Elena : Why are we here? What are you doing? This isn't the way out of here. You need to see something. ( ♪ ) (Gasp) No... No... That's not possible. That's not possible. Nothing's real. You're still in your cell. (Laughing) Hallucinating. You can't signal your friends. I know I'm real. You lied to me. You were never going to help me. You just wanted to get out. No... You only care about yourself, Elena. Can't escape your own mind. Selfish! They're all going to die because of you. For  you. Please... Stop... Ah... (Screaming) You are a monster! And you deserve to suffer for it! (Voice distorting) You are going to stay here... forever. ( ♪ ) (Screeching) (Screaming) (Screaming) (Various chanting) (Church bells tolling) Wait. They're heading out to the field. We have to go through the woods. Oh, no no no, we're not going to get far if these things start heating up again. We can disable them. The entire invisible perimeter. We have to get to Aleister's quarters. It's on the other side of the compound. Let's go. Clay : Elena. All we have to do is walk away and everything will be all right. Elena : What's down there? Clay : Peace. The peace you're looking for. I failed Savannah. I promised I'd protect her. Come with me. It's for your own good. You can let it all go. No. I don't want to let it go. That's not what I want. Then what do you want? Love. Love? In the end, it's all that matters. It is the key. We're not monsters. Because we... we can love? You're on your way back, now. You're going to need those, darling. (Echoing) Get outside. Signal me. (Approaching running footsteps) (Grunting) ( ♪ ) Various : (Chanting) ...the one true path. He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing. He is the one true path. He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing. Bow before the two who shall remain. Gather the power. (Deep rumbling) (Eerie whispering voices) ( ♪ ) Crowd : (Chanting) ...the Undoing. He is the one true path. He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing. He is the one true path. He is the light that will guide us to the Undoing... (Clink) Stop! Give me the girl! Elena. I want Savannah. Now! (Rumble of explosion) Okay, that did not sound like a ritual. I don't care. Let's just get out of here. There. That's what powers these marks. (Zap) Ah! You know, you could've warned me. Rachel... I love you. All right? And I'm sorry, I didn't mean for any of this to happen. You came back for me. It counts for something. Let's just get out of here. Aleister! ( ♪ ) Clay : Find Elena and Savannah. I'll take care of this. Savannah. We have to go. Sorry, Elena. I tried to resist. But he's too strong. He didn't do the spell. He didn't kill all of the witches. We can go. Oh... I can't. I have to stay. They don't love me. They want to control me. You don't have to do anything. Okay? Just... Come with me. We'll get out of here. Okay? Aleister : Savannah, you know you aren't going anywhere. Fight to the end. I'm impressed. I wish I could've spent more time with you. I have everything I need from you. I don't understand why you would care so much about these witches. Not long ago, you didn't even know they existed. I'm not leaving here without her. That's too bad. This is how it ends for you. (In foreign language) (Low rumble, eerie music) ( ♪ ) Paige : (Foreign language) (Clinking of glass) Paige! Let Savannah go! Aleister : Paige. I'm glad it's you. We never got the chance to know each other. I don't want to know you. That's no way to talk to your big brother. No. It's not possible. Ruth Winterbourne had a son. Me. You're lying. She didn't want me. But now she'll know the pain of losing the child she did want. Ah-ah-ah, careful. You come at me, she might get hurt. Oh... Elena : Savannah. He doesn't have any power over you. No one can control you. Show them who you trust, Savannah. I am the lock. Savannah.  I am the lock. I am your friend. (Panting) (Screaming) (Screaming) (Panting) Savannah : (Sobbing) Paige! It's okay, Savannah. We have you. Where did you send Aleister? I'm not sure. Imago. I am the lock... ( ♪ ) That thing is over! Not until we're miles away from here. Get in. Logan! This time, you're going to do what  I  say. Get in! (Eerie music) ( ♪ ) Where's Elena? She's okay. She's taking Savannah to the car. Clay : Did you do this? I guess I did. He's dead. It's finally over. I need to find Elena. Clay! (Groaning) The symbol's gone. Where am I? Do you remember anything? I was feeding pigeons in Sheridan Park, talking to a man... What city? This isn't Albany? What's happening? Oh my God. Who are you people? What happened? Dormi. We're going to have problems when they all wake up. I can keep them sleeping. But it would be better if they could wake up somewhere other than here. Okay, the last thing we need is an investigation into what happened here. Jeremy and Nick will arrive in an hour. They'll figure out how to get these people far away. Just as long as they don't remember any of this. No, they won't. I'll watch out for them! Dormi. Elena : You okay? Savannah : Yeah. You kept your promise. I don't like letting my friends down. Elena, can we stay friends? I don't mean texting each other every now and then. I mean... We actually can get to see each other. I'd like that. Clay : Elena! Oh, you're safe... You made it. Nothing would've stopped me. Get me as far away from here as possible. I'll get you home, how about that. Did they hurt you? I saw things, Clay. I almost lost my mind. I'll be here for you. You always were. (Sighing) (Eerie music) (Engine ignition) Clay : There's no sign of Rachel and Logan. They must've escaped. Elena : Then we're all safe. (Eerie music) ( ♪ )
