 Previously on AMC's 
 "The Walking Dead" 
 There's walkers in the barn. 
 My wife and stepson are in that barn. 
 They're not people. 
 You did more for my little girl today than her own daddy ever did in his whole life. 
 Now, you've been vague about that night, about what happened. 
 Otis died a hero. 
 I know what kind of man you are. 
 We can't leave I'm pregnant. 
 Anything else I should know about? 
 Shane and I... 
 I know. Of course I know. 
 ( Knife scraping ) 
 Hey. 
 Where'd you go? 
 I'm here. 
 Um, guys. 
 So... 
 The barn is full of walkers. 
 ( Moaning, growling ) 
 ( Growls ) 
 You cannot tell me you're all right with this. 
 No I'm not, but we're guests here. This isn't our land. 
 This is our lives! 
 Glenn: Lower your voice. 
 Andrea: We can't just sweep this under the rug. 
 Shane: It ain't right. Not remotely. 
 Okay, we've either got to go in there, we've got to make things right or we've just got to go. 
 Now we have been talking about fort Benning for a long time. 
 We can't go. 
 Why, Rick? Why? 
 Because my daughter is still out there. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I think it's time that we all start to just consider the other possibility. 
 We're not leaving 
 Sophia behind. 
 I'm close to finding this girl. 
 I just found her damn doll two days ago. 
 You found her doll, Daryl. That's what you did. You found a doll. 
 You don't know what the hell you're talking about. 
 I'm just saying what needs to be said. 
 You get a good lead, it's in the first 48 hours. 
 Shane, stop. 
 Let me tell you something else, man. If she was alive out there and saw you coming all methed out with your buck knife and geek ears around your neck, she would run in the other direction. 
 ( All shouting ) 
 Back off! 
 Keep your hands off me. 
 Now just let me talk to Hershel. 
 Let me figure it out. 
 What are you gonna figure out?! 
 If we're gonna stay, if we're gonna clear this barn, I have to talk him into it. This is his land. 
 Hershel sees those things in there as people... 
 Sick people... His wife, his stepson. 
 You knew? 
 Yesterday I talked to Hershel. 
 And you waited the night? 
 I thought we could survive one more night. 
 We did. 
 I was waiting till this morning to say something. 
 But Glenn wanted to be the one. 
 The man is crazy, Rick, if Hershel thinks those things are alive or no.

 ( Walkers growling ) ( Theme music playing ) The Walking Dead S02E07 "Pretty Much Dead Already" By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD== ( Walkers growling ) Glenn: Maggie. Hey, Maggie, just talk to me. Hey. Maggie. Give me your hat. You said talk to you, I'm talking to you. Give me your hat. Why would you waste an egg like that? I think it was rotten. Does Shane think Sophia's dead? Shane's just scared. Of the walkers in the barn? Yeah. Mom, I'm not leaving until we find Sophia. And I don't want to go even after that. Well, we're not leaving, Carl. You finish those problems. I just think she... She's gonna like it here. This place, it could be a home. ( Grunts ) You can't. I'm fine. Hershel said you need to heal. Yeah, I don't care. Well, I do. Rick's going out later to follow the trail. Yeah well, I ain't gonna sit around and do nothing. No, you're gonna go out there and get yourself hurt even worse. We don't know if we're gonna find her, Daryl. We don't. I don't. What? Can't lose you too. ( Groans ) Are you all right? Just leave me be. Stupid bitch. Andrea's looking for you. Thank you, Glenn. Any chance you got an extra hat? Nope. Thanks. ( Gun cocks ) Going off with Rick to look for Sophia. I thought he was talking with Hershel. He is. We're gonna go after. I'm headed to the barn in the meantime. Shane wants a watch duty down there. Does Rick? Why wouldn't he? Are you only getting yours? I don't know what's going on with you and him. Him? Shane. Dale. It's not my business. All that matters to me is that you... You may not really know him. We don't need to do this. You and I are finally... It's important. I get it. You don't like him. It isn't that. Then what is it? Is that how you want to be? Like him? He's not a victim. You don't know him. Dale, I need you to stop. You spend so much time watching me, looking out for me. You want to beat me up anytime I show any concern. Go ahead. I'm done. I'm not beating you up, Dale. I'm okay, really. Things are... Different. You got your gun. Okay. - You okay? Dale: Yeah. You mind running and getting me some water? I just... I need a second. You'll keep watch? Dale? Yeah sure. ( Knocks ) Come on in. A little light reading for lunch? Been working so hard lately I get my studying where I can. You know we can help you out with your work. It's my field to tend. We found the barn. Leave it be. Well, I'd like to talk about it, but either way... your barn, your farm, your say. I don't want to talk about the barn. I don't want to debate. Not a debate, a discussion. I need you and your group gone by the end of the week. I talked to Dale. You and I have our differences with the way we look at the walkers. Those people, they may be dead, they may be alive. But my people, us, we are alive right now, right here, right in front of you. You send us out there and that could change. I've given you safe harbor. My conscience is clear. This farm... This farm is special. You've been shielded from what's been going on out there. Dale said you saw everything happen on the news. Well, it's been... It's been a long time since the cameras stopped rolling. The first time I saw a walker it was just half a body snapping at me from the ground. My inclination wasn't to kill it. But what the world is out there isn't what you saw on TV. It is much much worse and it changes you. Either into one of them or something a lot less than the person you were. Please do not... do not send us out there again. My wife's pregnant. That's either a gift here or a death sentence out there. If we were to stay we could help you with the work, with securing this place. We can survive together. Rick, I'm telling you we can't. You think about what you're doing. I've thought about it. Think about it. I've thought about it. Think about it again. We can't go out there. ( Door closes ) What's it gonna be, man? Which way does this thing go? I don't know yet. Well, what did he say? We're negotiating. You're nego... Clock's ticking, Rick. No it isn't, Shane. That barn... The barn is secure. We didn't even know about it till this morning. We didn't. Well, we know about it now. Right? We know there's over a dozen walkers in there. We know that it's about a stone's throw from our camp, Rick... Where we sleep. So look, if we're not gonna go in there and clear it out then we just got to go. We're not gonna clear it out and we're not gonna go. We at least need our guns. We can't have them, not here. Why do you want to stay here when it's not safe? We can make it safe. How we gonna do that? We will, okay? How we gonna make it safe? We will, okay? No, man, it's not okay. Shane, Lori's pregnant. We need to stay. We need our guns. No, I can work this out. You good? Yeah. Lori's having a baby, man. Congratulations. Thank you. Hi, honey. Carl doesn't need any more of my help. So that's it? Rick was trying to make his case. It'll be hard. They'll have to be careful. But he was being dramatic. They're a strong group. They've done well on their own. They're just gonna have to go out and find their own farm. There's plenty of them now to chose from. There aren't. Every one of them nearby is burned out or full of walkers. Walkers? So we just keep these people here forever? How are they my responsibility? A new command I give to you: Love one another as I have loved you. That's what you told me, right? I was mad about mom. Mad about you marrying Annette. I was 14 years old and I was awful, to you more than anybody. All I wanted to do was smoke and shoplift. Love one another. That's what you told me. Maggie. That was different. No. You're different. I am. But we're not. I love you. That's part of this. Is this about you and the Asian boy? Do you want me to... No. ( Sighs ) 
 
 His name is Glenn. He saved my life yesterday when one of the people you think is sick tried to kill me. How's that for dramatic? Things aren't what you think they are. They aren't. Don't do this. Okay? It's not about me and Glenn. It's not about me and you. It's about you. It's about who you are, who you're gonna be. Jimmy: Hershel! It happened again. Rick: Also shows she could be moving this way South. If Sophia kept in that direction, she might have gotten out of the forest and into the farmland. So we take 74 up to Ivy Road, then push down South on foot through the forest till we hit Christopher, go east a couple of miles and then double back. Rick. Hershel. We just have our guns out because we're gonna go look for Sophia. Before you do that, I could use your help with something. Count me in. Thank you, but I just need Rick. I'll be down at the barn keeping watch until you're ready. I thought he was dead. Shane, I don't... Then when he came back, right then, right there, you see I wished he was. Not... not because you wouldn't be mine, but because I knew that sooner or later he would be dead. See Rick, he ain't built for this world, not for what it is now. You're wrong. You're wrong. Lori, how many times has he saved your life? I just... I want to know how many times. Because by my count, I've saved your life on four different occasions. And that's Carl's too. So I just want to ask you, how many times has Rick saved your life? That night at the camp. That night at the camp after the fish fry. No no no. See, no. That was me too. You see, Rick, he showed up late because he went on a suicide mission over nothing. Yeah, he joined in, but see, we wouldn't have been in that situation if he hadn't left because he felt that he needed to leave to save a drug dealer. And so we lost Amy and we lost Jim. We lost... Rick told me. Told you what? And I know the reason why you didn't is because you know it's mine. It's Rick's. Okay. You know, we carried on quite a bit before Rick got back, Lori. It's mine. You know it is. You're wrong. You're wrong. I'm sorry. Shane, I'm sorry. But even if it's yours, it's not gonna be yours. It's never gonne be yours and there's nothing you can do to change that. I don't need to. Hey, Shane. Can I talk to you for a sec? You okay? Yeah. I know you think Sophia's dead and that we should stop looking for her. But that's... that's bullshit. Hey, man, watch your mouth. We're gonna stay here until we find her. You think that's what we should do? It's what I know we should do. Then we stay. That means we got to do whatever we got to do to make that happen. Hmm? Like help out with chores? Mmm. Like help out with the chores. Lori: Carl. Come here for a minute. Why don't you go see what your mom wants? Hmm? Go on. Hey, Carl. Don't let me hear you talk like that again. Glenn: S'up? Son of a bitch. You see where he went? Who? Don't even try to sh1t me, okay? - What? Dale, Glenn. Did you see where Dale went? Yeah, he asked me to run and get him some water. He said he'd cover me on watch. And he was gone when you got back, huh? Yeah. You think he's okay? Oh, he's fine. Why'd he bail then? So you wouldn't tell me which way he went. I don't get it. No, man, you don't. The silt on the bottom is like glue. You just sink in. ( Walkers growling ) That's Lou Bush. You knew him? Lou as in Louise. She has a farm up the road. Sweet corn mostly. Worked at Hapman's bar on weekends. The man, I don't know him, but the coveralls, I've been to where he worked. How many have you killed? Too many to count. Can you stop? There are people out there who haven't been in their right minds, people who I believe can be restored. You're not talking about the walkers, are you? It doesn't matter if you see them as human beings anymore. But if you and your people are going to stay here, that's how you're gonna have to treat them. My farm, my barn, my say. Daryl: You see it? Carol: See what? I'll find her. Hey, I'm sorry about what happened this morning. You wanted to look for her. Why? This whole time I've wanted to ask you. 'Cause I think she's still out there. Truth is, what else I got to do? We'll find her. We will. I see it. Otis said if you get them halfway out they'll do the rest of the work. How many times did he do this? If one wandered onto the property, Otis would get them into the barn. Now we have to. What happens when the barn gets full? Jeez! Get the pole! Jimmy. Jimmy. You got it. Easy. Easy, Rick. Lead him. Jimmy will spot for us. Lead him lead him, Rick. You're the carrot, not the stick. You heard me, just lead him. He'll come to you. You told me he handled them easily. This is easy? It's easier than some things. Jimmy: Come on. Come on, over here. Maggie. Hey. Maggie. Maggie. Maggie, just stop for a second. You talked about it. You told Dale, fine. I asked you. I told you. I just asked you for one thing. One thing. I couldn't do it. My dad's gonna kick you guys out now. He told me. No, Rick's gonna work something out with your dad. Okay? I had to tell them. You did not. No, I did. I wanted to. Listen, you see I forgot. Okay? I forgot or I stopped thinking about it or maybe I didn't want to think about it. I let them lower me into that well like it was fun, like I was playing "portal." It's a video game. Of course it's a video game. And then the pharmacy happened yesterday and I realized something. I forgot that they're dangerous. I don't care if they're sick people or dead people, they're dangerous. And then I realized something else. That I don't want you in danger ever. So I hate to blow your dad's big secret, but I'm sick of secrets. Secrets get you killed. And I'd rather have you pissed off at me and alive than liking me and dead. So that's why I told them. Hey, walker bait. Don't call me that. Okay, Glenn. ( Laughs ) Shane: Man, this is a good hiding place. We ain't been in the swamps much, huh? Imagine if you applied your tracking skills to finding Sophia. How about you just give me that bag, huh? I'm not gonna do that. Yeah you are, Dale. Unless, well, you do have that rifle over your shoulder. You gonna shoot me like you did Otis? Tell another story? ( Chuckles ) No, man. Hell, when you really look at it in the cold light of day, you're pretty much dead already. Just give me the guns. Do it now. You think this is gonna keep us safe? Mm-hmm. I know it is. Rick is trying to get Hershel... Dale, shut up. Just shut up and give me the guns. Am I gonna have to shoot you? Do I have to kill you? Is that what it's gonna take? ( Chuckles ) Eh. Yeah. That's what it's gonna take. This is where you belong, Shane. How's that, Dale? This world, what it is now, this is where you belong. And I may not have what it takes to last for long, but that's okay. 'Cause at least I can say when the world goes to sh1t I didn't let it take me down with it. Fair enough. You look like you should be in line for the early bird special. Go get your cap. I'll wash it for you, okay? Do you know what's going on? Where is everyone? You haven't seen Rick? He went off with Hershel. We were supposed to leave a couple hours ago. Daryl: Yeah you were. What the hell? Rick told us he was going out. Damn it. Isn't anybody taking this seriously? We got us a damn trail. Oh, here we go. What's all this? You with me, man? Yeah. Time to grow up. You already got yours? Yeah. Where's Dale? He's on his way. Thought we couldn't carry. We can and we have to. Look, it was one thing sitting around here picking daisies when we thought this place was supposed to be safe. But now we know it ain't. How about you, man? You gonna protect yours? That's it. Can you shoot? Can you stop? You do this, you hand out these guns, my dad will make you leave tonight. We have to stay, Shane. What is this? We ain't going anywhere, okay? Now look, Hershel, he's just gotta understand. Okay? He... Well, he's gonna have to. Now we need to find Sophia. Am I right? Huh? Now I want you to take this. You take it, Carl, and you keep your mother safe. You do whatever it takes. You know how. Go on, take the gun and do it. Rick said no guns. This is not your call. This is not your decision to make. Oh sh1t. ( Jimmy clapping ) ( Walkers growling ) What is that? What is that? Lori: Shane! ( Growling ) What the hell are you doing? Shane, just back off. Why do your people have guns? Are you kidding me? You see? You see what they're holding onto? I see who I'm holding onto. No, man, you don't. Shane, just let us do this and then we can talk. What you want to talk about, Rick? These things ain't sick. They're not people. They're dead. Ain't gonna feel nothing for them 'cause all they do, they kill! These things right here, they're the things that killed Amy. They killed Otis. They're gonna kill all of us. Shane, shut up! Hey, Hershel man, let me ask you something. Could a living breathing person, could they walk away from this? - ( Gunshots ) Rick: No! Stop it! That's three rounds in the chest. Could someone who's alive, could they just take that?! Why is it still coming? ( Gunshots ) That's its heart, its lungs. Why is it still coming? ( Gunshots ) Shane, enough. Yeah, you're right, man. That is enough. ( Gunshot ) Enough risking our lives for a little girl who's gone! Enough living next to a barn full of things that are trying to kill us. Enough. Rick, it ain't like it was before! Now if y'all want to live, if you want to survive, you got to fight for it! I'm talking about fighting right here, right now. Rick: Take the snare pole. Hershel, take the snare pole. Hershel, listen to me, man, please. Take it now. Hershel! Take it! ( Shouting ) No, Shane. Do not do this, brother. Wait! Don't do it! Rick! Please! Come on. Come on, we're out here. This is not the way! Please! Get behind me. Come on. ( Growling ) Maggie. It's okay. Stay back! Rick: Stop! ( Growling ) ( Feet shuffling ) ( Growls ) ( Carol sobbing ) Sophia? Sophia! Oh no. Sophia. Sophia. No. ( Carol sobbing ) ( Growling ) Sophia. Don't watch. ( Wailing ) By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD==
