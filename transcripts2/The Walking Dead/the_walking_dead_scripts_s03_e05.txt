 Previously on AMC's 
 The Walking Dead... 
 That gate is open! 
 Lori! 
 People here have homes. The sense of purpose, we're a community. 
 Ahh! 
 No! 
 Michonne, it is just a day or two. 
 I thought we had an agreement. 
 I'm sorry... 
 Ah! 
 She'll turn. 
 She's my mom. 
 ( gunshot ) 
 ( baby crying ) 
 Where is she? 
 No, no. 
 ( music playing ) 
 Thanks. 
 Man in cap: Thank you. 
 Brownie: Yeah. Pack of smokes and Brown Thunder. 
 Merle:  Don't get cocky, boy. 
 - Thank you. 
 Cold drinks? 
 Been running the freezers all day. 
 Not the most practical use of the generators to my mind. 
 It's kind of amazing. 
 The Governor feels it's worth it. 
 Well, to a great party. 
 Now, if you would just drop me a hint about tonight. 
 Hmm. 
 Mere words cannot adequately describe the festivities ahead. 
 Hmm. 
 ( music playing, voices overlapping ) 
 Eh--! 
 ( soft music playing ) 
 ( raspy breathing ) 
 ( snarling ) 
 Penny. Penny, no. 
 Easy. Penny, let's go. 
 ( snarling ) 
 It's nap time now. 
 Nap time. 
 Penny, no. 
 Penny. Hey, hey, hey. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Take it easy. 
 It's all right. 
 Hey, I'm here. 
 ( Penny moans ) 
 Daddy still loves you. 
 You know that, right? 
 ( snarling ) Hey. 
 All right. All right. 
 Come on. Yeah. 
 Hey, Penny. 
 ( Penny whines ) 
 ( theme music playing ) 
 ( crying echoes ) 
 ( panting ) 
 ( muffled ) Rick, you with me? 
 Rick? 
 Let me see the baby. 
 We're gonna feed it. 
 We got anything a baby can eat? 
 The good news is she looks healthy. 
 But she needs formula. 
 And soon, or she won't survive. 
 No. No way. Not her. 
 We ain't losing nobody else. I'm going for a run. 
 I'll back you up. 
 I'll go too. 
 Okay, think where we're going. Beth. 
 Kid just lost his mom. 
 His dad ain't doing so hot. 
 I'll look out for him. 
 ( muffled baby crying ) 
 You two get the fence. Too many pile up, we got ourselves a problem. 
 Glenn, Maggie, vámonos. 
 Rick! 
 Daryl: 
 Get the gate. 
 Come on, we're gonna lose the light. 
 There's a Piggly Wiggly on 85. 
 No, the baby section's been cleared. 
 Lori asked me to keep an eye out. I haven't had much luck. 
 Is there any place that hasn't been completely looted? 
 We saw signs for a shopping center just north of here. 
 Yeah, but there's too much debris on the road. 
 The car will never get through there. 
 I can take one of you. 
 I'll go. 
 No, Maggie, after everything that you've been through, okay, I'll go. 
 I want to go. For Lori, I have to. 
 Okay. 
 I love you. Be safe. 
 I will. 
 ( revs motor ) 
 ( gate screeches ) 
 ( bangs ) 
 ( snarling ) 
 - ( Rick shouts ) 
 All right! 
 Hey. 
 First time we gathered, there was nine of us holed up in an apartment with spam and saltine crackers. 
 Well, look at us now. 
 ( laughs ) 
 We've built a place we can call home. 
 May be held together with duct tape and string, but it works. 
 It's ours. I'll take it. 
 ( laughs ) 
 So today we celebrate how far we've come. 
 We remember those we've lost. 
 We raise a glass... to us. 
 ( cheering ) 
 Man: 
 Hear, hear! 
 ( thumping ) 
 Man:  ...suggesting we delay a couple of days. 
 Man #2:  We can't wait. Everything's ready. 
 I love a party as much as the next fella. 
 Trust me, I love a party. 
 But we're using a lot of resources. 
 Yeah. 
 For instance, the generators. 
 I thought you love a party. 
 Merle:  Come on, Milty, lighten up, for Christ's sake. 
 Let your hair down, man. Have some fun for once. 
 I like fun. 
 - Then there's no problem. 
 If I might. 
 You know, I've been working on an experiment all week. 
 It's been a challenge getting the level of power I need. 
 And with everything going on tonight-- 
 - What are you asking? 
 Postpone tonight. 
 No way. 
 Hang on. Let's hear him out. 
 How long do you need? 
 I don't need long. 
 How long? 
 10 days. 
 No. 
 Six? 
 No. 
 How about-- 
 How about you enjoy yourself tonight and then begin the experiment over in the morning, huh? 
 Uh, yeah. That could work. 
 ( flies buzzing ) 
 ( snarling ) 
 ( snarling ) 
 ( door creaks ) 
 ( bangs ) 
 ( door opens ) 
 You get off on that? 
 Poking around other people's things? 
 Hmm? 
 We got nothing to hide here. 
 People with nothing to hide don't usually feel the need to say so. 
 That's fair. 
 We all have our secrets, huh? 
 Like Penny? 
 You know about Penny? 
 Then you know I loved her. 
 Bet you say that about all the girls. 
 You got the wrong idea about me. 
 I'm just a guy trying to do right by the people I care about. 
 Now, you want to leave, Andrea wants to stay. 
 So you want me to take choice out of the equation. 
 You want me to kick you out. 
 Actually, I was about to give your sword back. 
 'cause you fit in. 
 We've enjoyed having you. 
 This is a real problem for me. 
 People follow the rules. And whether or not it's true, they believe it's what keeps them alive. 
 You've turned that upside down. 
 You've broken the rules. 
 And if I don't do anything, I invite anarchy. 
 How about this? 
 I keep a lid on your little outburst, you join the research team. 
 You obviously have skills and you're not afraid of biters. 
 Merle will take care of you and then-- 
 ( door bangs ) 
 How'd it go? 
 ( chuckles ) 
 She's all personality, that one. 
 Do we have a problem? 
 No. No. 
 Send Andrea over to me. 
 You can take the research team to get more grist for the mill. 
 I can handle this. 
 All right. 
 ( door closes ) 
 How's the perimeter look? 
 We got the walkers spread out. 
 Need help? 
 Your friends, they-- 
 they were good folks. 
 They were family. 
 I think I had one friend like that my whole life. 
 You got a whole group. 
 Sorry you lost 'em. 
 I need two more. 
 Rick? 
 Still inside. 
 Okay, I'll get him. 
 A third of our group in one day. 
 'Cause of one asshole. 
 Part of me wishes that we killed all the prisoners on sight. 
 Axel and Oscar seem like good guys. 
 When the evacuations started, T-Dog drove his church van to the home of every senior he knew just in case they needed a ride. 
 He saved my ass a thousand times. 
 He wasn't just a good guy. 
 He was the best. 
 Got bit closing the gate. 
 If he hadn't done that... 
 It could have been Maggie. 
 It's wrong, but... 
 I'd trade any number of people for one of ours any day. 
 What's wrong? Merle said it was urgent. 
 I need your help. 
 It's Michonne. 
 What about her? 
 She broke in, stole her weapon. 
 She can't steal something that's hers. 
 Then she went into a private place and slaughtered half a dozen captive biters. 
 Why would you have captive biters? 
 There's a good reason I don't want to go into right now. 
 Okay. 
 Point is, I tried to talk to her about it and she pulled her sword on me. 
 Held it to my throat. 
 Can't imagine that surprises you. 
 She wouldn't do that unless she felt threatened. 
 She makes people uncomfortable. 
 Some people want her to leave and I don't want that. 
 It's ugly out there and it's getting worse every day. 
 But she put my back against the wall here. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying what works out there doesn't work in here. 
 You know, we're not barbarians. 
 We got to talk. 
 We got to go. 
 The Governor told me what happened. 
 Michonne, you can't 
 do things like this. 
 You're freaking people out. 
 You're freaking me out. 
 The northeast wall is guarded by some girl. 
 We can escape there after dark. 
 We are not prisoners here. 
 No one who comes here leaves. 
 What are you talking about? 
 It's safe. There's food, there's shelter. 
 There's people, for God's sake. 
 That's what they show you. 
 But you can't leave unless they make you. 
 You are not making any sense. 
 Mich, maybe you need to sit for a minute. 
 You need to trust me. 
 And you need to give me more to go on. 
 We got a good thing going here. 
 I thought this was temporary. 
 And I think we need this. 
 I want to give this place a real shot. 
 I tried. - Breaking into houses? That is not trying. 
 That is sabotaging. 
 This place is not what they say it is. 
 Rick? 
 Everybody's worried about you. 
 You shouldn't be in here. 
 Come on out. 
 Rick. 
 You don't have to do this all by yourself. 
 Okay? 
 
 
 
 Our cell block is cleared. 
 We'll just close off all the doors again. 
 Rick, why don't you just with me? 
 Okay? 
 Rick. 
 ( grunts ) 
 ( panting ) 
 ( softly ) 
 Yeah... yeah... 
 It's me. 
 Hey, all right. 
 We got us a bite. 
 Yeah, we got us some. Let's hook 'em up. 
 ( snarling, moaning ) 
 That's it. 
 Ho! Ho! 
 Ho, whoa! Look what we got here. 
 Oh, yeah. Come get it. 
 Come get it. Whoa! Jeez! 
 Look at this one. It's too little. 
 We're gonna have to kill it. 
 Hold on. 
 There's something interesting in its eyes. 
 So don't kill it? 
 It's a maybe for me. 
 Here you go. 
 Get your hands dirty for once, huh? 
 All right. Come on. Come on down. 
 Let 'em down now. Come on, Milty. 
 ( growling ) 
 Get her, boy! Get her! 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Oh! Oh, man! I tell you what, I take back everything 
 I said about that jacket. 
 Come here. Let me see her. 
 Let me see her. 
 Merle, check this one out. 
 He's almost as ugly as you. 
 Holy sh1t! Yeah, he's a mean one, huh? 
 Look at him. 
 Yeah, now get him down now. Come on, get him down. 
 Get him down. Yeow! 
 Easy now. Open up, baby. 
 Got him! Yeah! There we go. Come on. 
 Don't give me no sh1t, boy. 
 There. 
 ( motor stops ) 
 Company's close. 
 Stay tight. 
 ( faint rattling ) 
 ( scratching ) 
 ( hisses ) 
 Hello, dinner. 
 I'm not putting that in my bag. 
 ( music playing ) 
 Merle: Hey, hey, hey, girls. 
 Where y'all off to in such a hurry? 
 Huh? 
 Hey, come on, now. 
 Come on. Hey, hey, hey. 
 Y'all are breaking my heart running away like that. 
 We're leaving. 
 It's almost curfew. 
 I'd have to arrange an escort. 
 I mean, the party's still going on. 
 Alright. 
 Wait here a second. 
 Brownie. Come here. 
 Listen up, bro. 
 The Governor told us we were free to come and go whenever we liked. 
 Sweetheart, nothing personal here, but you're gonna have to step back. 
 See? 
 There's always a reason why we can't leave yet. 
 Clear. 
 Now if I was y'all, I'd find some shelter before nightfall. 
 ( gate creaks ) 
 They knew we were coming. This was all for show. 
 Do you hear yourself? How can you know that? 
 And why would they bother? 
 Ladies. 
 Close the gates. 
 No. 
 I practically begged 
 The Governor to let you stay. 
 I didn't ask for that. 
 You didn't have to. 
 That's what friends do for each other. 
 It goes both ways. 
 So you want to run around out there with walkers on chains eating twigs? 
 Is that right? 
 We held our own. 
 Eight months. Eight months on the road moving place to place, scavenging, living in a meat locker. 
 That was no life. 
 I'm tired. I'm tired. 
 I don't have another eight months in me. Not like that. 
 And you, I... 
 What about me? 
 I'm afraid you're gonna disappear. 
 We always talked about this place, didn't we? 
 A refuge. 
 That idea is what kept us going. 
 Are you coming or not? 
 Don't do this. 
 Don't give me an ultimatum. 
 Not after everything. 
 Are you coming or not? 
 You'd just slow me down anyway. 
 Michonne! 
 ( bangs ) 
 I'm sorry things didn't work out with your friend. 
 Weird to lose someone by their own choice. 
 Thought those days had gone. 
 Not sure this will make you feel better, but I'm sure you could use a drink. 
 Some company. 
 Something to take your mind off of it for a bit. 
 Come on. 
 ( snarling ) 
 ( motor roars ) 
 Guys, they're back. 
 Come on! Come on! Come on! 
 Yo! Come on! 
 Come on! 
 ( gunshots ) 
 ( baby crying ) 
 Beth. 
 Daryl: How's she doing? 
 Shh. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Shh... 
 Come on. Come on. 
 ( crying stops ) 
 ( chuckles ) 
 She got a name yet? 
 Not yet. 
 But I was thinking maybe Sofia. 
 Then there's Carol, too. 
 And... 
 ( sighs ) Andrea. 
 Amy. 
 Jacqui. 
 Patricia. 
 Or... Lori. I don't know. 
 You like that? 
 Huh? 
 Little ass-kicker. 
 Right? That's a good name, right? 
 Little ass-kicker. You like that, huh? 
 You like that, sweetheart? 
 Little ass-kicker. You like that, huh? 
 ( snarling ) 
 ( grunts ) 
 ( screams ) 
 ( gunshot ) 
 ( grunting ) 
 ( shouting ) 
 ( music blaring )

 Come on! 
 I don't feel-- 
 Come on! 
 Whoo! 
 ( music continues ) 
 - ( cheering ) 
 Yeah! 
 ( chanting ) 
 Merle! Merle! Merle! 
 Merle! Merle! Merle! 
 I'm gonna kick his ass one-handed. 
 Oh, the hell with it. No-handed! 
 Yeah! 
 ( grunts ) 
 Yeah! 
 ( cheering ) 
 Whoo! 
 No hands! 
 Bring it on. 
 ( snarling ) 
 All right, let's get it on! 
 ( cheering ) 
 ( whistle tweets ) 
 Yeah! Come on! 
 Come on, get up. Get up. 
 ( snarls ) 
 He's got nothing. Nothing, folks. 
 Get up. 
 Come on! 
 ( blows whistle ) 
 Hey! 
 Come on, let 'em fight. 
 ( crowd booing ) 
 Merle: Come on, pretty boy. Let's dance. 
 Hey, hey! Where you going? 
 What the hell is this? 
 It's a way to blow off steam. 
 Blow off steam? 
 You go for a jog to blow off steam. 
 This is-- 
 this is sick. 
 Look around. Everyone's having a great time. 
 It's barbaric. 
 ( quietly ) It's staged. 
 ( laughs ) 
 Yeah, we pull out the biter's teeth. 
 It's just all for show. 
 ( snarling ) 
 That's crazy. 
 This is your reason for keeping walkers around? 
 People need entertainment. 
 So your solution is gladiator fights? 
 We're reducing these things. We're controlling them. 
 We're shining a light on the monster under the bed. 
 It's fun. 
 It makes people feel better about the whole thing. 
 It's a slippery slope. 
 You're teaching them that walkers aren't dangerous. 
 We're teaching them not to be afraid. 
 Come on, baby. 
 Come on. Walk it off, huh? 
 Uno! 
 Dos! 
 Tres! 
 ( whistle blows ) 
 ( crowd cheering ) 
 ( locusts buzzing ) 
 ( phone ringing ) 
 ( ringing continues ) 
 Hello?
