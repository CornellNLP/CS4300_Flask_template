 Was he bit? 
 Shot 
 I have to open him up, find the bleeder and stitch it. 
 You need a respirator. 
 The thought of her, out here by herself... 
 We're gonna locate that little girl. 
 She's gonna be just fine. 
 Two miles down is our farm. You'll see the mailbox... 
 Pressure's dropping 
 We can't wait much longer. 
 If Shane said he'll be back, he'll be back.

 Lori: Rick, just... 
 You've got to keep your strength up. 
 Rick: Lori, did you... 
 I mean, it was legendary. 
 Did you ever hear about the time Shane stole Kingsley's car? 
 Lori: Yeah. 
 Rick: The Principal's car 
 right out of the teacher's lot 
 in the middle of a school day. 
 Shane steps out of lunch and makes a beeline 
 to Kingsley's Hyundai... 
 ( Chuckles ) Wires the ignition, peels out, drives down Dylan drive to that chicken farm out there. You've heard this before, right? So he pulls it into one of the big holding pens. Kingsley, he waxed that thing every month; had the auto shop vacuum it out every week. Shane, he parks it in this huge pen with a couple of hundred Rhode Island reds. He busts open bags of seed in the back seat, rolls down all the windows, and then starts sprinting back to school. It's three miles away easy. He's back in time to finish his sandwich before the bell. And then the bell rings. Shane gets up and when he runs into Kingsley in the hallway he looks out the window and says, "Principal Kingsley, your coupe's gone." ( Chuckles ) Coupe, like chicken coop. I get it. Of course you do. You've heard this story 1000 times. What you said before, you're right. Shane's gonna make it back with what the doctor needs. He'll make it back. Hershel said you need to eat. Carl's gonna be all right. Please, for me. You've got to keep your strength up. ( Metal clinking ) ( Carol sobbing ) I need my clip now. I'm gonna walk the road, look for the girl. I'm coming too. I'm going for a walk. Shine some light in the forest. If she's out there, give her something to look at. You think that's a good idea right now? Dale. ( Moaning ) Those windows, what's on the other side? About a 20-foot drop with nothing to catch you, maybe some bushes, then the athletic field. We just need enough time. We got to get up there. We got to get 'em open and get out. Not me. Maybe you. Hey hey hey. Come on, man, look at me. You really think I can squeeze through one of them tiny windows? They'd be all over us. Look, we lay down some fire to get a head start. You stay here. I hop down and draw them away. That gives you the chance to get up the bleachers and out a window. And where do you go? Locker room down those steps. Looks like a good way to get trapped. It's got windows too, and more my size. I get out through one, I double back, we meet up out on the field. You're a crazy son of a bitch, ain't you? Just trying to do right for that boy. You take three shots and you go. After that I fire. I'll lay down a cover for you. I'll get you a lead. All right. Oh God. ( Screams ) ( Grunting ) ( Panting ) ( Groans ) ( Gunshots ) ( T-Dog shivering ) So do we ring the bell? I mean it looks like people live here. We're past this kind of stuff, aren't we? Having to be considerate. Did you close the gate up the road when you drove in? Uh, hi. Yes, we closed it. Did the latch and everything. Hello. Nice to see you again. We met before briefly. Look, we came to help. There anything we can do? It's not a bite. I cut myself pretty bad though. We'll have it looked at. I'll tell them you're here. We have some painkillers and antibiotics. I already gave him some. If Carl needs any. Come on inside. I'll make you something to eat. ( Air hissing ) Hey. Hey. Um, we're here, okay? Thank you. Whatever you need. They don't get back soon, we're gonna have a decision to make. And that is? Whether to operate on your boy without the respirator. - You said that wouldn't work. I know. It's extremely unlikely. But we can't wait much longer. You really think we're gonna find Sophia? You got that look on your face same as everybody else. What the hell's wrong with you people? We just started looking. Well, do you? It ain't the mountains of Tibet. It's Georgia. She could be holed up in a farmhouse somewhere. People get lost and they survive. It happens all the time. She's only 12. Hell, I was younger than her and I got lost. Nine days in the woods eating berries, wiping my ass with poison oak. They found you? My old man was off on a bender with some waitress. Merle was doing another stint in juvie. Didn't even know I was gone. I made my way back though. Went straight into the kitchen and made myself a sandwich. No worse for wear. Except my ass itched something awful. ( Laughs ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that is a terrible story. ( Both laugh ) Only difference is Sophia's got people looking for her. I call that an advantage. Maybe this isn't a world for children anymore. Yeah well, we have a child. Carl is here in this world now. Maybe he shouldn't be. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be. You can't mean that. Okay. All right. I can understand that thought crossing your mind. It didn't cross my mind, Rick. I can't stop thinking it. Why do we want Carl to live in this world? To have this life? So he can see more people torn apart in front of him? So that he can be hungry and scared for however long he has before he... So he can run and run and run and run and then even if he survives he ends up... he ends up just another animal who doesn't know anything except survival? If he... if he dies tonight, it ends for him. Tell me why it would be better another way. What changed? What? Jenner offered us a way out. You asked him to let us keep trying. You begged him. "For as long as we can," you said. What changed? There was a moment the other day... it was just a second but I forgot Jacqui was dead. I turned around, I wanted to tell her something. I almost said her name. It was just a second and then I remembered. But then I realized she didn't have to see any of it. The highway, the herds, Sophia, Carl getting shot... she didn't... She doesn't have to be afraid anymore. Hungry. Angry. It hasn't stopped happening, Rick. It's like we live with a knife at our throats every second of every day. But Jacqui doesn't. Not anymore. And then... I thought, "maybe Jenner was right." I don't accept that. I can't accept that. That man surrendered. It doesn't Matt... it doesn't matter what he said. None of it. You really think it would be better if Carl... if we just gave up? Tell me why it would be better the other way. Please. 
 
 ( Walkers moaning ) ( Gunshot ) Man, I thought I'd lost you. That was my last rifle round. Mine too. Come on. Come on. Come on. ( Carl coughing ) Where are we? Hey, little man. That's Hershel. We're in his house. You had an accident. All right? It hurts, a lot. Oh baby, I know. I know. You should have seen it. What? The deer. It was so pretty, mom. It was so close. I've never been... Carl? What is happening? ( Grunting ) Don't. It's a seizure. If you hold him down, you could hurt him. You can't stop it? He has to just go through it. ( Lori sobbing ) His brain isn't getting enough blood. His pressure is bottoming. He needs another transfusion. Okay, I'm ready. If I take any more out of you your body could shut down. You could go into a coma. - Or cardiac arrest. You're wasting time. Come on, man. We need a way out. ( Gasping ) Just let me catch my breath. Come on. ( Growling ) ( Gasps ) ( Stairs clinking ) Can't sleep? I'm gonna wait for them to come back. You can go down and sleep if you want to. No, we can keep watch together. Which way did they go? ( Rustling ) ( Rustling ) What the hell? ( Gagging ) "Got bit. Fever hit. World gone to sh1t. Might as well quit." Dumbass didn't know enough to shoot himself in the head. Turned himself into a big swinging piece of bait. And a mess. - ( Groans ) You all right? Trying not to puke. Go ahead if you gotta. No, I'm fine. Let's just talk about something else for a minute. How'd you learn to shoot? Gotta eat. That's one thing these walkers and us have in common. I guess it's the closest he's been to food since he turned. Hanging up there like a big pinata. The other geeks came and ate all the flesh off his legs. ( Vomits, coughs ) I thought we were changing the subject. Call that payback for laughing about my itchy ass. There wasn't a lot that came up. Huh. Let's head back. Aren't you gonna... No. He ain't hurting nobody. Ain't gonna waste an arrow either. He made his choice. Opted out. Let him hang. You want to live now or not? It's just a question. An answer for an arrow. Fair? I don't know if I want to live or if I have to or if it's just a habit. Not much of an answer. Waste of an arrow. You don't need to worry. She's with Daryl. If something happens he can protect her. You hear what I'm saying? Sorry, all I heard was if something happens. You mind keeping watch? I don't know how to use that. I won't be gone long. If you see anything, call out. I'm not going far. I'll hear you. You got here right in time. This couldn't go untreated much longer. "Merle Dixon." Is that your friend with the antibiotics? No, ma'am. Merle's no longer with us. Daryl gave us those... his brother. Not sure I'd call him a friend. He is today. This doxycycline might have just saved your life. You know what merle was taking it for? The clap. Um, venereal disease. That's what Daryl said. I'd say merle Dixon's clap was the best thing to ever happen to you. I'm really trying not to think about that. Are you praying? Why do you sneak up on people so much? You're easy to sneak up on. I was praying. I was trying to. You religious? You pray a lot? Actually this was my first try. Ever? Wow. Sorry. I didn't mean to wreck your first time. God probably got the gist. - Praying for what? My friends. Looks like they could all use a little help right now. You think... you think God exists? I always took it on faith. Lately I've wondered. Everything that's happened, there must have been a lot of praying going on. It seems quite a few went unanswered. Thanks. This is really helping. Sorry. Go ahead. Really. You gonna watch? I'll get you a refill instead. I know it's not my business, and feel free to believe in God, but the thing is you've got to make it okay somehow no matter what happens. Before it happened we were standing there in the woods and this deer just crossed right in front of us. I swear it just planted itself there and looked Carl right in the eye. And I looked at Carl looking at that deer, and that deer looking right back at Carl. And that moment just... ( Sighs ) Slipped away. It slipped away. That's what he was talking about when he woke up, not about getting shot or what happened at the church. He talked about something beautiful, something living. There's still a life for us, a place maybe like this. It isn't all death out there. It can't be. We just have to be strong enough after everything we've seen to still believe that. Why is it better for Carl to live even in this world? He talked about the deer, Lori. He talked about the deer. Shane: Oh, sh1t. ( Both groan ) Got to get to the street, double back to the truck. Look, we ain't gonna make it, okay? Got to try, man. Come on, get up. You're gonna take these bags and you're gonna go. I ain't leaving you behind. Okay. How many rounds you got left? Four. You? Five and one in the pipe. ( Snarling, growling ) ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) He's still losing blood faster than we can replace it. And with the swelling in his abdomen we can't wait any longer or he's just going to slip away. Now I need to know right now if you want me to do this, because I think your boy is out of time. You have to make a choice. A choice? A choice. You have to tell me what it is. You have to tell me what it is. We do it. Okay, get the corner of that bed. Let's get the sheets down. Get the I.V. bag on the sheet. Okay, on three. One, two, three. Rick, Lori, you may want to step out. ( Truck approaching ) Rick: Oh God. You stay here with him. Carl? There's still a chance. Otis? No. We say nothing to Patricia. Not till after. I need her. They kept blocking us at every turn. We had nothing left. We were down to 10 rounds. Then he said... he said he'd cover me and that I should keep going. So that's what I did. I just... I kept going. But I... I looked back and he... I tried. He wanted to make it right. ( Crying ) Andrea. Wait. What do you want, Dale? To give you this. I care about you so I made a choice for you... choices. I know why I did it, but this is not my gun. And the choices that I made for you were not mine to make. But I can still ask, and this is not to make you guilty or put me ahead of you, but I can still ask, please... Don't make me regret this. I'll take watch. So do you forgive me for... do you forgive me? I'm trying. I've known Otis since I was a kid. He's run this farm since before my mother died. Who else? Who'd you lose? You told me I had to make it okay somehow. That's what you've been trying to do, right? Which ones? Stepmother. Stepbrother. He seems to have stabilized. ( Exhales ) Oh God. I don't have words. I don't either. Wish I did. How do I tell Patricia about Otis? You go to Carl. I'll go with Hershel. ( Patricia sobbing ) ( Sobbing ) Stay. The bathroom's upstairs. I brought you some clothes. Thank you. They won't fit well. They were Otis's. Shane: How many rounds you got left? Otis: Four. You? Shane: Five and one in the pipe. ( Groans ) Come on. ( Panting ) Down to my last. Me too. I'm sorry. ( Gunshot ) ( Screams ) ( Growling ) Will you give it... ah! Give it! ( Otis screaming ) I'll kill you. ( Shane screams ) ( Screams ) Let go of me! Let go!
