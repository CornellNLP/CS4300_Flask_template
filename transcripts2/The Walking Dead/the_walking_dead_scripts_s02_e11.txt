 Previously on AMC's 
 The Walking Dead... 
 I'm taking him out to the main road, send him on his way. 
 That is my wife. That is my son. 
 I went to school with 
 Maggie, for God's sake! 
 Shane, no! 
 That's my call, man! 
 I don't think you can keep them safe. 
 Shane! Come back in! 
 Probably gonna have to kill that boy, but I am gonna think about it tonight. 
 If you're gonna be with us, you gotta follow my lead, you gotta trust me. 
 I told you-- 
 You told me sh1t! 
 I barely knew those guys. I met 'em on the road. 
 How many in your group? 
 Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, man. 
 How many?! 
 Uh, 30-- 30. 
 30 guys. 
 Where? 
 Uh... 
 I don't know. I swear. 
 We were never anyplace more than a night. 
 Scouting? Planning on staying local? 
 I-- I don't know. They-- they left me behind. 
 Did you ever pick off a scab? 
 Come on, man! 
 I'm-I'm trying to cooperate. 
 Start real slow at first. 
 No. - Sooner or later, you've just gotta rip it off. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 They have weapons-- 
 Heavy stuff, automatics. 
 But I didn't do anything. 
 Your boys shot at my boys, tried to take this farm. 
 You just went along for the ride? You're trying to tell me you're innocent? 
 Yes! 
 These-- these people took me in. 
 Not just guys-- 
 A whole group of 'em. 
 Men and women, kids too-- 
 Just like you people. 
 Thought I'd have a better chance with them, you know? 
 But... 
 We go out, scavenge-- 
 Just the men. 
 One night, we-- we found this little campsite. 
 A man and his two daughters-- 
 Teenagers, you know? 
 Real young. Real cute. 
 Their daddy had to watch while these guys-- they-- 
 And they didn't even kill him afterwards. 
 They just-- 
 They just made him watch as his daughters-- 
 They just-just-- 
 just left him there. 
 No, but-but-- but I 
 didn't touch those girls. 
 No, I swear 
 I didn't to-- 
 Please. 
 Please. You gotta believe me, man. 
 I'm not like that. 
 I ain't like that. 
 Please. Please, 
 you gotta believe me. 
 So, what you gonna do? 
 We'd all feel better if we knew the plan. 
 Is there a plan? We gonna keep him here? 
 We'll know soon enough. 
 Boy there's got a gang, 30 men. 
 They have heavy artillery and they ain't looking to make friends. 
 They roll through here, our boys are dead. 
 And our women, they're gonna-- 
 They're gonna wish they were. 
 What did you do? 
 Had a little chat. 
 No one goes near this guy. 
 Rick, what are you gonna do? 
 We have no choice. He's a threat. 
 We have to eliminate the threat. 
 You're just gonna kill him? 
 It's settled. I'll do it today. 
 You can't do this. 
 You don't wanna do this. I know you don't. 
 I thought about it all night. 
 Knowing what we know now, I don't see a way out of it. 
 But you can't just decide on your own to take someone's life. 
 The group seemed supportive. 
 What, because they didn't speak back? You didn't let 'em. 
 There's gotta be a-- 
 a process. 
 And what would that be? We can't call witnesses, go before a judge. - So he's automatically guilty by association and sentenced to death? 
 He's just a kid. 
 Gimme some time to talk to everyone... 
 We can't-- 
 ...try to figure out another way-- 
 No, we can't drag this out! 
 People are scared. - Which is why they need time to discuss this. 
 No, no, no, they need to be safe. 
 I owe 'em that. 
 You think about your son! 
 The message that you're giving him-- 
 Shoot first, think later. 
 I'm asking for one day to talk to everybody. 
 You can give me that. Think-think about Carl. 
 I am. 
 We reconvene at sunset, then what happens, happens. 
 I need a favor. 
 Did you move the gun bag? 
 Yeah. 
 I need you to guard Randall, protect him. 
 Why? - Rick's giving me time to talk to the others, try and talk some sense into them. 
 But if Shane finds out-- 
 You think he'd just shoot the guy himself? 
 You know killing the boy had to be his idea. 
 Are you with him on this? 
 He's a threat. 
 Tell me this isn't all the ammo. 
 You're a civil rights lawyer. 
 Was. 
 You fight with words, the power of ideas. 
 Using a-a gun, that's his way. 
 You really want to debate about saving a guy who will lead his buddies right to our door? 
 That's what a civilized society does. 
 Who says we're civilized anymore? 
 No, the world we knew is gone, but keeping our humanity? 
 That's a choice. 
 I'll watch your prisoner. 
 But not because 
 I think you're right. 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 Can I get some water? 
 Please? 
 I'm very thirsty. 
 They're gonna kill me, right? 
 So he's a kid? 
 He ain't a kid. Just-- 
 That's a figure of speech. 
 - Can I see him? 
 - No. 
 Look, man, this is-- 
 this is grown-up stuff, all right? 
 You just-- you just let us handle this. 
 Dale, huh? 
 What, he put you 
 on death watch? 
 Let me ask you something-- 
 Say I wanted to go in there right now and I just wanted to take care of this, you gonna stop me? Hmm? 
 I had a good teacher. 
 Yeah. 
 So what? 
 You buy into Dale's sob story? 
 I told him I was with you on this. 
 Mmm... you're just still here for him, huh? 
 That's cute. 
 You see what's happening, 
 don't you? 
 These guys ain't gonna go through with this. 
 I'm telling you, they gonna-- 
 They gonna pussy out. And if they do, we gonna have a big problem on our hands. 
 Let me ask you something-- 
 Every time we have a problem around here, who do you think's behind it? 
 Some might say you. 
 Nah. No one listens to me. 
 I say it's the guys that make up the rules,  the boys that always have 
 all the answers, 
 even though their answers always prove wrong. 
 So what are you gonna do? Rick's the leader of this group, it's Hershel's farm. 
 Maybe we oughta change that. 
 What, are you gonna lock 'em in a room and take their guns? 
 I don't know. That could get out of hand. 
 No, no, it won't. Okay? I won't let it. 
 Listen, I don't-- I don't want anybody to get hurt, okay? 
 Rick's my friend, Hershel-- 
 He's all right by me. 
 And Dale? 
 Dale got a big mouth, but he's harmless. 
 Look, I just-- I wanna know what it's like to sleep without keeping one eye open. 
 Ain't that-- 
 ain't that what we all want? 
 Hey, ball's in 
 their court. Maybe I'm wrong. 
 Maybe I'm getting 
 all worked up over nothing. 
 Hey. 
 That's a sweet hat. 
 I'm Randall. 
 What's your name? 
 The sheriff guy-- 
 That your dad? 
 I like him. 
 Yeah, he's a good guy. I can tell. 
 Your mom out here too? 
 You're-- you're lucky 
 you still got your family. 
 I lost mine. 
 Hey, I-- I don't know what people been saying about me, but I didn't do nothing. I swear. 
 Your dad was gonna let me go till his friend started fighting with him. 
 It got pretty bad. I-- I was kinda worried. 
 My camp, we got lots of supplies. 
 You help me, I'll take you and your folks back to my people. 
 We'll take good care of you. 
 Keep you safe. 
 Just gotta-- 
 Just gotta help me get out of here, okay? 
 Just help me pick these locks or find the key, okay? 
 Come on, please? Please? 
 What the hell are you doing in here? What did you say to him? 
 What did you say to him, huh? 
 I didn't say nothing. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Let me tell you something-- 
 I will shoot you where you sit. 
 Okay Shane, not now. 
 Open your mouth. Open your mouth. 
 Shane. 
 You like talking, man? You like talking?! 
 Back off! 
 Get your ass out this door. Let's go. 
 The hell you doing? 
 Please don't tell my parents. 
 Carl, that ain't cool, man. You could've gotten hurt in there. 
 I can handle myself. 
 Let me tell you something-- 
 you do not go near him again. Do you hear me? 
 Damn it. 
 You won't tell my parents, will you? 
 Carl, man, this-- 
 This isn't about getting in trouble, okay? 
 A guy like that, he will say anything to you. 
 He'll try to make you feel sorry for him. 
 He'll try to make you get your guard down. 
 You let your guard down out here, people die. 
 Now, just-- 
 Do me a favor, man-- 
 Go find your ma. Go on. 
 Carl, quit trying to get yourself killed, man. 
 The whole point of me coming up here is to get away from you people. 
 Gonna take more than that. 
 Carol send you? 
 Carol's not the only one that's concerned about you, your new role in the group. 
 Oh, man, I don't need my head shrunk. 
 This group's broken. 
 I'm better off fending for myself. 
 You act like you don't care. 
 Yeah, it's 'cause I don't. 
 So live or die, you don't care what happens to Randall? 
 Nope. 
 Then why not stand with me, try to save the kid's life, if it really doesn't matter one way or the other? 
 Didn't peg you for a desperate son of a bitch. 
 Your opinion makes a difference. 
 Man, ain't nobody looking at me for nothing. 
 Carol is, and I am. Right now. 
 And you obviously-- 
 You have Rick's ear. 
 Rick just looks to Shane. Let him. 
 You cared about what happened to Sofia. 
 Cared what it meant to the group. 
 Torturing people? 
 That isn't you. 
 You're a decent man. 
 So is Rick. 
 Shane-- He's different. 
 Why's that? 
 'Cause he killed Otis? 
 He tell you that? 
 He told some story-- 
 How Otis covered him, saved his ass. 
 He showed up with the dead guy's gun. 
 Rick ain't stupid. 
 If he didn't figure that out, it's 'cause he didn't wanna. 
 It's like I said-- 
 Group's broken. 
 Baby, where's your daddy? 
 He's up there. 
 All right. 
 So, uh... 
 The nights are getting colder and we're pretty exposed. 
 I was thinking-- 
 Maybe we could clear this place out, station lookouts up here. 
 Uh... 
 Or we could talk to Hershel about staying in the house. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Is that really the best way to do this? 
 To... string him up? 
 I have no idea. 
 It's my first time. 
 Look, I know how you feel about the death penalty, but-- 
 And I know the world has changed. 
 After everything that's happened, you and Shane agree on this. 
 So you support this decision? 
 If you think it's best. 
 You never did tell me what happened on the road with you and Shane. 
 He won't be a problem anymore. 
 You know, we'll see Sophia again in heaven some day. 
 She's in a better place. 
 No, she's not. 
 Heaven is just another lie, and if you believe it, you're an  idiot. 
 You need to control that boy. 
 Carl? What happened? 
 He's disrespectful. Did he say something? Something cruel about Sofia. We'll figure it out. It's okay. I-- It's not okay. I'll have-- I'll have a talk with him. See? We'll-- we'll-- we'll deal with it. If you can calm down, so that I can-- Don't tell me to calm down! No, I-- I don't-- I don't need you to patronize me. Everyone either avoids me or they treat me like I'm crazy. I lost my daughter. I didn't lose my mind! 
 
 Carl, come over here. Did you talk back to Carol? No. She says you did. You can't talk back to people like that. I said it's stupid to believe in heaven. 'Cause it is. Well, just think about that for a minute. She just lost her daughter. She wants to believe she's still alive in some way. But she-- Don't-- Don't talk. Think. It's a good rule of thumb for life. Mom always wants you to talk more. Don't change the subject. You owe Carol an apology. You made a mistake. Fix it. Is that why you're gonna kill that guy? Fixing your mistake? That's different. How are you gonna do it? Are you gonna hang him in the barn? You just think about how you're gonna make things right with Carol. Don't talk. Think. You got it? Yeah. What happened? A dozen steer busted through the fence. Been wrangling the runaways all morning. But you're not here to talk cattle. The boy. The prisoner. Randall. I don't want to know. I'm told they're deciding his fate. I'll leave it with Rick. But this is your home. I want him away from my girls. I don't care how. It's an execution. I don't want to know. But you can't stand by the sidelines. You're a man with convictions. You-- To tell you the truth, I was. Or at least I thought I was. But I've made too many mistakes. Would you at least talk with Randall before making up your mind? No. I'll leave it with Rick. What's up, Dale? I wanna change your mind. What, you serious? I know you and I will never see eye to eye on much... Say that's the understatement of the year, huh? ...but, uh, you're not going anywhere... Nope. ...and I'm not going anywhere. Okay. So let's talk about this like men. Okay. You deny we're in danger, Dale? No, but there's a dozen of us, one of him. There's 30 of them. Killing him doesn't change that... No. ...But it changes us. You-- You got balls, Dale. I'm gonna give you that. Now... I'll tell you what-- In a little bit, when y'all gather, you're gonna talk about this. If you've convinced them to keep this guy alive, then I ain't gonna say a damn word about it, okay? But I'm telling you now, man to man, you're wrong. And when this guy kills somebody, I ain't gonna need to say anything, because that blood-- That's gonna be on you. You're wrong about this, Dale. You're dead wrong. Doodlebug, doodlebug, go away home. Doodlebug. Doodlebug, doodlebug, go away home. How is she? She seems to be in good spirits today. Aren't you, doodlebug? Well, let me know if I can do anything. Where's your family from? Michigan. But, uh, before that, Korea. Immigrants built this country. Never forget that. Our family came from Ireland. Maggie Greene-- I kinda figured. My grandfather brought this over from the old country. He passed it on to my father, who passed it on to me. I pawned it to pay for a night of drinking I no longer remember. You bought it back. My late wife did-- Josephine, Maggie's mother. She gave it back years later when I sobered up. She was a good woman, my jo. Maggie's a lot like her. When we were in that bar and afterwards, I thought about a lot of things. You become a father someday, you'll understand. No man is good enough for your little girl... Until one is. Go on now, before I change my mind about you. Thanks. It's almost time. I know this isn't easy for you. It isn't easy for anyone. But I thought it through. I made the call. I'm ready to do this. You don't have to be the one to do it-- Shane, Daryl. Yeah, it has to be me. I brought him back here. Maybe I shouldn't have. I gotta keep these people safe. That is what I'm gonna do. What about Dale? He's got an uphill battle. You said you support me. I do. But you didn't say you think I'm making the right call. This is the right call. Let's gather up. Come on, Carl. I want you to stay with Jimmy. But I wanna listen. Hm-mmm, not this time. Come on. So how do we do this? Just take a vote? Does it have to be unanimous? How about majority rules? Well, let's-- let's just see where everybody stands, then we can talk through the options. Well, where I sit, there's only one way to move forward. Killing him, right? I mean, why even bother to even take a vote? It's clear which way the wind's blowing. Well, if people believe we should spare him, I wanna know. Well, I can tell you it's a small group-- Maybe just me and Glenn. Look, I-- I think you're pretty much right about everything, all the time, but this-- They've got you scared. He's not one of us. And we've-- we've lost too many people already. How about you? Do you agree with this? Couldn't we continue keeping him prisoner? Just another mouth to feed. It may be a lean winter. We could ration better. Well, he could be an asset. Give him a chance to prove himself. Put him to work? We're not letting him walk around. We could put an escort on him. Who wants to volunteer for that duty? I will. - I don't think any of us should be walking around with this guy. He's right. I wouldn't feel safe unless he was tied up. We can't exactly put chains around his ankles, sentence him to hard labor. Look, say we let him join us, right? Maybe he's helpful, maybe he's nice. We let our guard down and maybe he runs off, brings back his 30 men. So the answer is to kill him to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt? If we do this, we're saying there's no hope. Rule of law is dead. There is no civilization. Oh, my God. Could you drive him further out? Leave him like you planned? You barely came back this time. There are walkers. You could break down. Y-you could get lost. Or get ambushed. They're right. We should not put our own people at risk. If you go through with it, how would you do it? Would he suffer? We could hang him, right? Just snap his neck. I thought about that. Shooting may be more humane. And what about the body? Do we bury him? Hold on, hold on! You're talking about this like it's already decided. You've been talking all day, going around in circles. You just wanna go around in circles again? This is a young man's life, and it is worth more than a five-minute conversation! Is this what it's come to? We kill someone because we can't decide what else to do with him? You saved him and now look at us. He's been tortured. He's gonna be executed. How are we any better than those people that we're so afraid of? We all know what needs to be done. No, Dale is right. We can't leave any stone unturned here. We have a responsibility-- So what's the other solution? Let Rick finish. - We haven't come up with a single viable option yet. I wish we could. So let's work on it! We are. Stop it. Just stop it. I'm sick of everybody arguing and fighting. I didn't ask for this. You can't ask us to decide something like this. Please decide-- Either of you, both of you-- But leave me out. Not speaking out or killing him yourself-- There's no difference. All right, that's enough. Anybody who wants the floor before we make a final decision has the chance. You once said that we don't kill the living. Well, that was before the living tried to kill us. But don't you see? If we do this, the people that we were-- The world that we knew is dead. And this new world is ugly. It's... Harsh. It's-- it's survival of the fittest. And that's a world I don't wanna live in, and I don't-- And I don't believe that any of you do. I can't. Please. Let's just do what's right. Isn't there anybody else who's gonna stand with me? He's right. We should try to find another way. Anybody else? Are y'all gonna watch, too? No, you'll go hide your heads in your tents and try to forget that we're slaughtering a human being. Whoa... I won't be a party to it. This group  is  broken. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait. Wait-- ah. Put him there. Oh, hey-hey! It's all gonna be over soon. What? What's gonna be over soon? Relax. Hey-- hey. No, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh. No. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Oh, no... no. Would you like to stand or kneel? Oh, no, please. Ple-- Ah-ah-ah. Do you have any final words? No, please. Please don't. Don't. Do it, dad. Do it. Are you kidding me? What'd I say to you? What did I say to you? Take him away. Take him away. Get up. Ah. Ah. We're keeping him in custody, for now. I'm gonna find Dale. Carl, go inside. Now, please. He followed us. He wanted to watch. I couldn't. That's okay. That's okay. Get Carl. Baby. What happened? Come here. Come here. T-dog, get a shotgun now! I want you to go in the house, I want you to lock the door and I want you to stay inside. Okay, okay. What was that? What happened? I don't know-- Go! No! Dale! Help! Over here! Help! Run! Hang in there, buddy. Who is it? Oh, my God. Oh, God. - Rick! - All right, just listen to my voice. Listen to me, all right? Just listen to me. Okay, hold on now. Get Hershel! He needs blood. We gotta operate now. - Hang on, Dale. Hang on. Listen to me. Come on-- Okay, just listen to my voice. All right, please. Hershel! We need Hershel! Look at me. Dale, we're gonna help. We're here. Just hold on-- hold on. - What happened? - What can we do? - Dale, it's gonna be okay. - Can we move him? - He won't make the trip. You have to do the operation here. Glenn, get back to the house. Rick. No! Oh, God. He's suffering. Do something! Come on. Oh, God. I'm sorry, brother.
