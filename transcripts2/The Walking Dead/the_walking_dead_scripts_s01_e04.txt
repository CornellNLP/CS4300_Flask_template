 On the lake 
 Amy and Andrea are fishing out in a boat. 
 Amy: What? 
 Andrea: Nothing. 
 Amy: It's not nothing. It's always something. 
 Andrea: Didn't dad teach you to tie nail knots? 
 Amy: Why would he do that? He only ever used a fisherman's knot. One knot. 
 Andrea: No, he didn't. No, he tied at least three. 
 Amy: Clinch knots? 
 Andrea: No way. Fine, I'm making it up. Did dad teach you mostly dry lures? 
 Amy: Yeah. You? 
 Andrea: Wet. 
 Amy: You're kidding. But he was always so adamant. I mean, you know dad on the fishing thing. 
 Andrea: Gee, you think? I only spent my entire childhood with my ass in a boat. But in my day it was all about getting the hook seated. We were fishing for the dinner table. 
 Amy: Not us. We always threw them back. Always. 
 Andrea: I guess he changed things up. 
 Amy: But that'd be like changing his religion or something. 
 Andrea: People change. It's not his fault we were born 12 years apart. 
 Amy: No. No, because the minute you went off to college it was my ass in that boat and he taught me dry lures from day one. This was not behaviour developed over time. 
 Andrea: You think he did it for us? 
 Amy: Because he knew we were so different. He knew that you needed to catch the fish and I needed to throw them back. 
 Andrea: All right, remember his rule: No crying in the boat. It scares the fish. 
 Amy: Mom and dad… I mean, maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad. Maybe it's better there. Do you think? 
 Andrea: I think you have a bite. Even with the wrong knots. 
 Amy: Oh God. So much for the no crying rule. 
 Andrea: I think that was more for dad than the fish. 
 The two girls smile. 
 At camp 
 Dale stands on top of the RV to keep watch for Walkers. He sees Jim over in the bushes digging holes. He realizes that Jim has been at it for quite awhile.  
 Close-up on Jim 
 He has dug several separate holes. 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 Building 
 In Atlanta, T-Dog, Daryl, Glenn and Rick still stare at Merle's severed hand. Daryl turns his crossbow on T-Dog to kill him, but Rick pulls out his Python. 
 Rick: I won't hesitate. I don't care if every walker in the city hears it. 
 Daryl realizes Rick is being honest and lowers the crossbow. 
 Daryl: You got a do-rag or something? 
 T-Dog hands him one and Daryl picks up Merle's severed hand that is already decaying. 
 Daryl: I guess the saw blade was too dull for the handcuffs. Ain't that a bitch. 
 He puts the hand in Glenn's backpack. 
 Daryl: He must have used a tourniquet… maybe his belt. Be much more blood if he didn't. 
 Daryl notices a blood trail. The group starts to follow it. T-Dog picks up the tools on the roof.  
 Daryl: Merle? You in here? 
 The group walks down the stairs. 
 Survival Camp 
 Dale walks out to see Jim. 
 Dale: Jim? You okay? You keep this up, you're gonna keel over out here. Drink some water at least. 
 Jim continues to dig holes and doesn't respond to him. 
 Building 
 Daryl shoots a Walker in an office with his crossbow. The group walks in and makes sure the coast is clear.  
 Daryl: Had enough in him to take out these two sumbitches. One handed. Toughest asshole I ever met, my brother. Feed him a hammer, he'd crap out nails. 
 Rick: Any man can pass out from blood loss, no matter how tough he is. 
 Survival Camp 
 Amy and Andrea come back to the camp with tons of fish for the camp. 
 Morales: Oh, baby. Will you look at that? Hey, check it out. Ladies… Because of you my children will eat tonight. Thank you. 
 Andrea: Thank Dale. It's his canoe and gear. 
 Carl: Mom, look. Look at all the fish. 
 Lori: Thank you. 
 Carl: Whoa. 
 Lori: Yeah, whoa. Where did you two learn to do that? 
 Amy: Our dad. 
 Carl: Can you teach me how to do that? 
 Amy: Sure. I'll teach you all about nail knots and stuff. If that's okay. 
 Lori: You won't catch me arguing. 
 Andrea: Hey, Dale. When's the last time you oiled those line reels? They are a disgrace. 
 Dale doesn't seem as happy as he usually is. 
 Dale: I, uh, I don't want to alarm anyone, but we may have a bit of a problem. 
 Shane comes up to the group. Dale points over to Jim who is still digging the holes. 
 Building 
 The group continues to search for Merle. Daryl shouts for Merle. 
 Daryl: Merle! 
 Rick: We're not alone here. Remember? 
 Daryl: Screw that. He could be bleeding out. You said so yourself. 
 They come upon a kitchen where a stove is still lighted. They find Merle's belt sitting on the top of it. 
 Daryl: What's that burned stuff? 
 Rick: Skin. He cauterized the stump. 
 Daryl: Told you he was tough. Nobody can kill Merle but Merle. 
 Rick: Don't take that on faith. He's lost a lot of blood. 
 Daryl: Yeah? Didn't stop him from busting out of this death trap. 
 Glenn: He left the building? Why the hell would he do that? 
 They come to a smashed window and they realize Merle left. 
 Daryl: Why wouldn't he? He's out there alone as far as he knows, doing what he's got to do. Surviving. 
 T-Dog: You call that surviving? Just wandering out in the streets, maybe passing out? What are his odds out there? 
 Daryl: No worse than being handcuffed and left to rot by you sorry pricks. You couldn't kill him. Ain't so worried about some dumb dead b*st*rd. 
 Rick: What about 1,000 dead dumb bastards? Different story? 
 Daryl: Why don't you take a tally? Do what you want. I'm gonna go get him. 
 Rick doesn't let him go. 
 Rick: Daryl, wait. 
 Daryl: Get your hands off me! You can't stop me. 
 Rick: I don't blame you. He's family, I get that. I went through hell to find mine. I know exactly how you feel. He can't get far with that injury. We could help you check a few blocks around but only if we keep a level head. 
 Daryl: I could do that. 
 T-Dog: Only if we get those guns first. I'm not strolling the streets of Atlanta with just my good intentions, okay? 
 Survival Camp 
 Jim is still digging holes. The whole camp comes out to see him. 
 Shane: Hey, Jim. Jim, why don't you hold up, all right? Just give me a second here, please. 
 Jim: What do you want? 
 Shane: We're all just a little concerned, that's all. 
 Morales: Dale says you've been out here for hours. 
 Jim: So? 
 Shane: So why are you digging? Are you heading to China, Jim? 
 Jim: What does it matter? I'm not hurting anyone. 
 Shane: Yeah, except maybe yourself. It's a hundred degrees today. You can't keep this up. 
 Jim: Sure I can. Watch me. 
 Lori: Jim, they're not gonna say it so I will. You're scaring people. You're scaring my son and Carol's daughter. 
 Jim: They got nothing to be scared of. I mean, what the hell, people? I'm out here by myself. Why don't you all just go and leave me the hell alone? 
 Shane: We think that you need to take a break, okay? Why don't you go and get yourself in the shade? Some food maybe. I'll tell you what… maybe in a little bit I'll come out here and help you myself. Jim, just tell me what it's about. Why don't you just go ahead and give me that shovel? 
 Jim: Or what? 
 Shane: There is no or what. I'm asking you. I'm coming to you and I'm asking you, please. I don't want to have to take it from you. 
 Jim: And if I don't, then what? Then you're gonna beat my face in like Ed Peletier, aren't you? Y'all seen his face, huh? What's left of it. See, now that's what happens when someone crosses you. 
 Shane: That was different, Jim. 
 Amy: You weren't there. Ed was out of control. He was hurting his wife. 
 Jim: That is their marriage. That is not his. He is not judge and jury. Who voted you king boss, huh? 
 Shane: Jim, I'm not here to argue with you, all right? Just give me the shovel, okay? 
 Jim: No, no, no. 
 Shane: Just give me the… Jim! 
 Jim shoves Shane away and then threatens to hit him with it. Shane tackles Jim to the ground. 
 Shane: Okay, shh shh. 
 Jim: You got no right! 
 Shane: Stop. Shh. 
 Jim: You got no right! 
 Shane: Jim, just stop it. Hey hey hey hey. 
 Jim: Don't! 
 Shane: Jim. Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you. You hear me? Shh. Jim, nobody is gonna hurt you, okay? 
 Jim: That's a lie. That's the biggest lie there is. I told that to my wife and my two boys. I said it 100 times. It didn't matter. They came out of nowhere. There were dozens of 'em. Just pulled 'em right out of my hands. You know, the only reason I got away was 'cause the dead were too busy eating my family. 
 Building 
 Rick: You're not doing this alone. 
 Daryl: Even I think it's a bad idea and I don't even like you much. 
 Glenn: It's a good idea, okay, if you just hear me out. If we go out there in a group, we're slow, drawing attention. If I'm alone, I can move fast. 
 He draws a map of the street on the ground and marks the tank and the bag of guns.  
 Glenn: Look. That's the tank, five blocks from where we are now. That's the bag of guns. Here's the alley I dragged you into when we first met. That's where Daryl and I will go. 
 Daryl: Why me? 
 Glenn: Your crossbow is quieter than his gun. While Daryl waits here in the alley, I run up the street, grab the bag. 
 Rick: You got us elsewhere? 
 Glenn points down the street. 
 Glenn: You and T-Dog, right. You'll be in this alley here. 
 Rick: Two blocks away? Why? 
 Glenn: I may not be able to come back the same way. Walkers might cut me off. If that happens, I won't go back to Daryl. I'll go forward instead, all the way around to that alley where you guys are. Whichever direction I go, I got you in both places to cover me. Afterwards, we'll all meet back here. 
 Daryl: Hey, kid, what'd you do before all this? 
 Glenn: Delivered pizzas. Why? 
 Outside 
 Glenn & Daryl crawl down the ladder and run down the alley. Rick & T-Dog head down the other alley. Daryl loads his crossbow. 
 Daryl: You got some balls for a Chinaman. 
 Glenn: I'm Korean. 
 Daryl: Whatever. 
 Glenn runs down the street. Several Walkers notice him, but don't aggressively chase him yet. While Daryl waits behind the trashcan, a young man of Mexican descent, Miguel, walks down the alley. Daryl spots him and points his crossbow at him. 
 Miguel: Whoa, don't shoot me! What do you want? 
 Daryl: I'm looking for my brother. He's hurt real bad. You seen him? 
 Miguel: Ayúdame! 
 Daryl: Shut up! You're gonna bring the geeks down on us. Answer me. 
 Glenn notices the Walkers start to converge on him as he grabs the bag of guns and Rick's sheriff's hat. He runs back down the street he came. 
 Daryl: Answer me. 
 Miguel: Ayúdame! Ayúdame! Ayúdame! 
 Rick & T-Dog hear yelling help and start to run over to Glenn and Daryl's alley. 
 Miguel: Help! Help! 
 Daryl: Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. 
 Two other Mexicans, one of them named Felipe, also come down the alley and they start to beat up Daryl. Glenn comes back with the guns and sees what is happening. 
 Felipe: That's it. That's the bag, Vato. Take it! Take it! 
 Felipe starts to run towards him and tries to grab the bag of guns. They grab Glenn and hold him hostage. Daryl shoots Felipe in the rear end with his crossbow and Felipe cries out in pain. 
 Glenn: Get off me! Get off me! Daryl! Daryl! 
 A car pulls up and they start to back up. One of the Walkers is crushed by one of the Mexicans. With no guns, but Glenn as a hostage, the group flees leaving Miguel behind as well. 
 Daryl: Come back here, you sumbitches! 
 Daryl grabs the gate and shuts it before the Walkers can get at them. Rick & T-Dog arrive to see what happened. 
 Rick: Whoa whoa whoa. Stop it. 
 Daryl: I'm gonna kick your nuts up in your throat! 
 Miguel: Let me go. 
 T-Dog: Chill out. 
 Daryl: They took Glenn. That little b*st*rd and his little b*st*rd homie friends. I'm gonna stomp your ass! 
 T-Dog: Guys! Guys! We're cut off! 
 Rick: Get to the lab. Go. 
 Daryl: Come on. Damn, let's go. 
 Rick picks up the bag of guns and his hat and the group runs back into the building. 
 Survival Camp 
 Jim is tied to a tree to protect him from hurting anyone or himself. Shane and Dale come up to him with some water. 
 Shane: Jim, take some water? 
 Jim: All right. 
 Shane: Yeah? All right. Here you go, bud. 
 Jim: Pour some on my head? 
 Shane: Yeah. Cooling you down, huh? 
 Jim: Yeah. How long you gonna keep me like this? 
 Shane: Well, yeah. Until I don't think that you're a danger to yourself or others. 
 Jim: Sorry if I scared your boy and your little girl. 
 Lori: You had sunstroke. Nobody's blaming you. 
 Jim: You're not scared now, are you? 
 Sophia: No sir. 
 Jim is glad to hear that. 
 Jim: Your mama's right. Sun just cooked my head is all. 
 Dale: Jim, do you know why you were digging? Can you say? 
 Jim: I had a reason. Don't remember. Something I dreamt last night. Your dad was in it. You were too. You were worried about him. Can't remember the rest. You worried about your dad? 
 Carl: They're not back yet. 
 Lori: We don't need to talk about that. 
 Carl: Your dad's a police officer, son. He helps people. Probably just came across some folks needing help, that's all. That man, he is tough as nails. I don't know him well but… I could see it in him. Am I right? 
 Shane: Oh yeah. 
 Jim: There ain't nothing gonna stop him from getting back here to you and your mom, I promise you that. 
 Shane: All right. Who wants to help me clean some fish, huh? 
 Carl: Sweet. Come on, Sophia. 
 Sophia and Carl run after Shane and Carol joins them. 
 Lori: Stay with Carol, all right? 
 Lori approaches Jim. 
 Jim: You keep your boy close. You don't ever let him out of your sight. 
 Lori nods in agreement and goes to join them. 
 Building 
 Rick: Those men you were with, we need to know where they went. 
 Miguel: I ain't telling you nothing. 
 T-Dog: Jesus, man. What the hell happened back there? 
 Daryl: I told you, this little turd and his douche bag friends came out of nowhere and jumped me. 
 Miguel: You're the one who jumped me, puto, screaming about trying to find his brother like it's my damn fault. 
 Daryl: They took Glenn. Could have taken merle too. 
 Miguel chuckles. 
 Miguel: Merle? What kind of hick name is that? I wouldn't name my dog merle. 
 Daryl goes to kick at Miguel, but Rick holds him back. 
 Rick: Damn it, Daryl. Back off. 
 Daryl pulls out Merle's hand. 
 Daryl: Want to see what happened to the last guy that pissed me off? 
 Miguel is freaked out by the hand and starts to back away. 
 Daryl: Start with the feet this time. 
 Rick holds Daryl back. 
 Rick: The men you were with took our friend. All we want to do is talk to them, see if we can work something out. 
 
 
 
 Hideout 
 The group arrives at the hideout. 
 Rick: You sure you're up for this? 
 T-Dog: Yeah. 
 Rick: Okay. 
 Daryl: One wrong move, you get an arrow in the ass. Just so you know. 
 Miguel: G's gonna take that arrow out of my ass and shove it up yours. Just so you know. 
 Rick: G? 
 Miguel: Guillermo. He's the man here. 
 Rick: Okay then. Let's go see Guillermo. 
 They walk up to the building and the doors open up. Guillermo walks out. 
 Guillermo: You okay, little man? 
 Miguel: They're gonna cut off my feet, carnal. 
 Guillermo: Cops do that? 
 Miguel: Not him. This redneck puto here. He cut off some dude's hand, man. He showed it to me. 
 Daryl: Shut up. 
 Felipe comes out and points a gun at Daryl. 
 Felipe: Hey, that's that Vato right there, homes. He shot me in the ass with an arrow. What's up, homes, huh? 
 Guillermo: Chill, ese, chill. Chill. This true? He wants Miguelito's feet? That's pretty sick, man. 
 Rick: We were hoping more for a calm discussion. 
 Guillermo: That hillbilly jumps Felipe's little cousin, beats on him, threatens to cut off his feet, Felipe gets an arrow in the ass and you want a calm discussion? You fascinate me. 
 Rick: Heat of the moment. Mistakes were made on both sides. 
 Guillermo: Who's that dude to you anyway? You don't look related. 
 Rick: He's one of our group, more or less. I'm sure you have a few like him. 
 Daryl: You got my brother in there? 
 Guillermo: Sorry, we're fresh out of white boys. But I've got Asian. You interested? 
 Rick: I have one of yours, you have one of mine. Sounds like an even trade. 
 Guillermo: Don't sound even to me. 
 Miguel: G. Come on, man. 
 Guillermo: My people got attacked. Where's the compensation for their pain and suffering? More to the point, where's my bag of guns? 
 Rick: Guns? 
 Guillermo: The bag Miguel saw in the street. The bag Felipe and Jorge were going back to get. That bag of guns. 
 Rick: You're mistaken. 
 Guillermo: I don't think so. 
 Rick: About it being yours. It's my bag of guns. 
 Guillermo: The bag was in the street. Anybody could come around and say it was theirs. I'm supposed to take your word? What's to stop my people from unloading on you right here and now and I take what's mine? 
 Rick: You could do that. Or not. 
 He indicates to the wall and T-Dog has the sniper rifle pointed at Guillermo. 
 T-Dog: Come on, man. Make the trade. Please. 
 Guillermo: Oye. 
 Two men appear on the roof with Glenn. 
 Guillermo: I see two options. You come back with Miguel and my bag of guns, everybody walks. Or you come back locked and loaded, we'll see which side spills more blood. 
 The Vatos head back into the hideout and shut the door. 
 Building 
 Rick unzips the bag of guns and starts to divide them. 
 Daryl: Them guns are worth more than gold. Gold won't protect your family or put food on the table. You're gonna give that up for that kid? 
 T-Dog: If I knew we'd get Glenn back, I might agree. But you think that Vato across the way is just gonna hand him over? 
 Miguel: You calling g a liar? 
 Daryl: Are you a part of this? You want to hold onto your teeth? 
 Daryl slaps him. 
 T-Dog: Question is, do you trust that man's word? 
 Daryl: No, question is what are you willing to bet on it? Could be more than them guns. Could be your life. Glenn worth that to you? 
 Rick: What life I have I owe to him. I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank. He could have walked away, but he didn't. Neither will I. 
 Daryl: So you're gonna hand the guns over? 
 Rick: I didn't say that. There's nothing keeping you two here. You should get out, head back to camp. 
 T-Dog: And tell your family what? 
 Miguel: Come on, this is nuts. Just do like g says. 
 Hideout 
 The group leads Miguel back with his hands tied behind his back. The doors open and Rick pushes Miguel in. 
 Guillermo: I see my guns but they're not all in the bag. 
 Rick: That's because they're not yours. I thought I mentioned that. 
 Felipe: Let's just shoot these fools right now, ese. All right? Unload on their asses, ese. 
 Guillermo: I don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation. 
 Rick: No, I'm pretty clear. 
 Rick cuts Miguel free. 
 Rick: You have your man. I want mine. 
 Guillermo: I'm gonna chop up your boy. I'm gonna feed him to my dogs. They're the evilest, nastiest man-eating bitches you ever saw. I picked them up from Satan at a yard sale. I told you how it has to be. Are you woefully deaf? 
 Rick: No, my hearing's fine. You said come locked and loaded. 
 Everyone cocks their guns and Rick points his gun at Guillermo. 
 Rick: Okay then, we're here. 
 Suddenly, an old woman comes out from behind the group and shouts for Felipe. 
 Abuela: Felipe! Felipe! 
 Felipe: Abuela, go back with the others… now. 
 Daryl: Get that old lady out of the line of fire! 
 Guillermo: Abuela, listen to your mijo, okay? This is the not the place for you right now. 
 Abuela: Mr. Gilbert is having trouble breathing. He needs his asthma stuff. Carlitos didn't find it. He needs his medicine. 
 Guillermo: Felipe, go take care of it, okay? And take your grandmother with you. 
 Felipe: ¡Abuela! Ven conmigo por favor. 
 Abuela: Who are those men? 
 Felipe: Por favor, ven conmigo. 
 Abuela: Don't you take him. 
 Rick: Ma'am? 
 Abuela: Felipe's a good boy. He has his trouble but he pulls himself together. We need him here. 
 Rick: Ma'am, I'm not here to arrest your grandson. 
 Abuela: Then what do you want him for? 
 Rick: He's… Helping us find a missing person. Fella named Glenn. 
 Abuela: The Asian boy? He's with Mr. Gilbert. Come. Come, I'll show you. 
 The grandmother takes Rick's hand and takes him. 
 Abuela: He needs his medicine. 
 Guillermo: Let 'em pass. 
 The Vatos let them pass. 
 Nursing Home 
 The grandmother takes Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog into a nursing home where a lot of elderly, sick patients are staying at. 
 Felipe: Abuela, por favor. Take me to him. 
 Rick realizes that the Vatos are protecting the individuals that are staying at the home. They come into the gymnasium where they find an elderly man having an asthma attack. Felipe and Glenn help him. 
 Felipe: All right. All right. Nice and easy. Just breathe. Just breathe. Just let it out. Just breathe. Just relax. 
 Rick: What the hell is this? 
 Glenn: An asthma attack. Couldn't get his breath all of a sudden. 
 T-Dog: I thought you were being eaten by dogs, man. 
 They look at the dogs which are little Chihuahuas. 
 Rick: Could I have a word with you? You're the dumbest son of a bitch I ever met. We walked in there ready to kill every last one of you. 
 Guillermo: Well, I'm glad it didn't go down that way. 
 Rick: If it had, that blood would be on my hands. 
 Guillermo: Mine too. We'd have fought back. Wouldn't be the first time we've had to. Protect the food, the medicine… what's left of it. These people, the old ones… the staff took off, just left 'em here to die. Me and Felipe were the only ones who stayed. 
 Rick: What are you, doctors? 
 Guillermo: Felipe's a nurse… a special care provider. Me, I'm the custodian. 
 Rick: What about the rest of your crew? 
 Guillermo: The Vatos trickle in to check on their parents, their grandparents. They see how things are and most decide to stay. It's a good thing too. We need the muscle. The people we've encountered since things fell apart, the worst kind… plunderers, the kind that take by force. 
 Rick: That's not who we are. 
 Guillermo: How was I to know? My people got attacked and you show up with Miguel hostage… appearances. 
 T-Dog: Guess the world changed. 
 Guillermo: No. It's the same as it ever was. The weak get taken. So we do what we can here. The Vatos work on those cars, talk about getting the old people out of the city. But most can't even get to the bathroom by themselves, still, it keeps the crew busy, and that's worth something. So we barred all the windows, welded all the doors shut except for one entrance. The Vatos, they go out, scavenge what they can to keep us going. We watch the perimeter night and day and we wait. The people here, they all look to me now. I don't even know why. 
 Rick: Because they can. 
 Rick hands Guillermo his shotgun and they divide the guns 50/50 for both groups. 
 Outside 
 The four men leave the nursing home. 
 Glenn: Admit it, you only came back to Atlanta for the hat. 
 Rick: Don't tell anybody. 
 Daryl: You've given away half our guns and ammo. 
 Rick: Not nearly half. 
 Daryl: For what? Bunch of old farts who are gonna die off momentarily anyhow? Seriously, how long you think they got? 
 Rick: How long do any of us? 
 They come to the spot where their truck was, but it is gone. 
 Glenn: Oh my God. 
 Daryl: Where the hell's our van? 
 Glenn: We left it right there. Who would take it? 
 Rick: Merle. 
 Daryl: He's gonna be taking some vengeance back to camp. 
 RV 
 Andrea searches for something in the cabinets. Dale comes in. 
 Andrea: Wrapping paper, color tissue, anything? 
 Dale: Seriously? 
 Andrea: How can you not have any? 
 Dale: Had I been informed of the impending apocalypse I'd have stocked up. 
 Andrea: It's Amy's birthday tomorrow. I've been marking days on the calendar just to make sure. 
 She shows him the mermaid necklace that she got for Amy at the department store in Atlanta. 
 Andrea: You don't give a gift unwrapped. 
 Dale: Deep breath. I'm sure I'll find something here. 
 Outside 
 Morales: I, uh, built up the rocks all around. See? So the flames can be a little higher and have 'em be hidden. 
 Shane and Carl walk up to Jim. 
 Shane: Hey, Jim. How you feeling, man? 
 Jim: I'm better. More myself now. 
 Shane: I hope you understand the need for this… this timeout. I've got others I've got to think about. I just want to make sure there's no… there's no hard feelings. 
 Jim: There's not. I do understand. 
 Shane: Okay. Why don't you come join in with the rest of us? Big ol' fish fry. 
 Jim: I'd like that very much. 
 Shane: Okay. 
 Tent 
 Carol and Sophia come to see Ed in the tent. Ed's face is bruised and he has been in the tent since the beating. 
 Carol: Why don't you come outside with everybody? 
 Ed: Hell with them people. Wouldn't piss on them if their heads were on fire. 
 Sophia goes to leave, but Ed holds onto her. 
 Ed: Hey! Why don't you stay here? Keep your daddy company. 
 Carol: Ed, she wants to join in. Come on. 
 They both leave. Ed continues to lie down in the tent. 
 Ed: Fine. Hell with the both of you. Ain't no need to be bothering me no more the rest of the night. 
 Outside 
 As dusk approaches, Rick, Glenn, T-Dog & Daryl run back to camp before Merle arrives. 
 Survival Camp 
 The group enjoys a fish dinner. Everyone is having a good time. 
 Woman: Pass the fish, please. 
 Man: Here you go. 
 Man: Man o man, that's good. I miss this. 
 Morales: I've got to ask you, man. It's been driving me crazy. 
 Dale: What? 
 Morales: That watch. 
 Dale: What's wrong with my watch? 
 Morales: I see you every day, the same time, winding that thing like a village priest saying mass. 
 Jacqui: I've wondered this myself. 
 Dale: I'm missing the point. 
 Jacqui: Unless I've misread the signs, the world seems to have come to an end. At least hit a speed bump for a good long while. 
 Morales: But there's you every day winding that stupid watch. 
 Dale: Time… it's important to keep track, isn't it? The days at least. Don't you think, Andrea? Back me up here. I like… I like what, um, a father said to son when he gave him a watch that had been handed down through generations. He said, "I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire, which will fit your individual needs no better than it did mine or my father's before me; I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you may forget it for a moment now and then and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it." 
 Amy: You are so weird. 
 Everyone laughs. 
 Dale: It's not me. It's Faulkner. William Faulkner. Maybe my bad paraphrasing. 
 Amy gets up from the campfire. 
 Andrea: Where are you going? 
 Amy: I have to pee. Jeez, you try to be discreet around here… 
 Everyone laughs. 
 Tent 
 At Ed's tent, Ed hears footsteps and sees a figure of a person outside of his tent. Ed thinks it Carol. 
 Ed: Thought I told y'all to leave me the hell alone, didn't I? Hey! What'd I say? 
 The person claws at the tent and Ed opens it to yell at her. It's a Walker. 
 Outside 
 Amy comes out of the RV. 
 Amy: We're out of toilet paper? 
 Tent 
 The Walker jumps on him and takes a bite right out of his neck. Several other Walkers join in.

 Jim picks up a baseball bat and crushes a Walker's skull with it. Everyone takes cover and Dale picks up his rifle. Some people are attacked and bitten by Walkers. Morales grabs a baseball bat and kills one of the Walkers with it. 
 Lori: I'm right here. Shane, what do we do? Shane? 
 Morales: Follow me! 
 The Walker that attacked Amy takes a bite out of her neck. Andrea runs to Amy screaming. Jim kills the Walker that attacked Amy and Andrea kneels over her sister. 
 Andrea: No! No! Oh God! Oh my God! 
 Amy: Help me. 
 Andrea: Oh God, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. 
 The fight continues and Shane keeps Lori and Carl close. 
 Shane: Come on. Come on, stay close. 
 Lori: Carol! 
 Shane: Stay close! 
 Morales continues to kill two more Walkers that are trying to get at his family. 
 Shane: Come on, y'all! Work your way up here! 
 Lori: Right in front of you. Shane! 
 Shane shoots another Walker. 
 Morales: Get to the RV! Go! 
 Morales is able to kill three more and flees for the RV. 
 Lori: Shane! Shane! 
 Shane: Stay with me. Stay behind me. Morales, work up here! 
 Lori: Get behind me! Let's go! Stay with me. 
 Shane: Come on, make your way to the Winnebago!

 Andrea: Amy! Amy! Amy! 
 As everyone else gets rounded back up, Jim turns away to see Amy. 
 Jim: I remember my dream now, why I dug the holes. 
 They look at the camp with several dead Walkers on the ground.
