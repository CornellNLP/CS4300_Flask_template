 Lucious : Previously on Empire... 
 So I don't have ALS. 
 Myasthenia gravis. Cookie : Look, no matter what, Tiana, you're family to us. Yo, you tryin' to make some money up in here? Plead guilty. Lucious : I don't care how many of us you've locked behind bars. You ain't never gonna be nothing Cookie : In partnership with Mimi Whiteman, we have taken a controlling interest in Empire. Sorry, brother, it's just business. Yeah, it's just business. Right, Mimi? Lucious Lyon is Empire. Without him, the company is nothing. I'm gonna bury your album, Hakeem. Get out of my father's house. You betrayed him. Who do you think you're talking to? You done now, lady. I gave my whole life to this place. My album done... now it's gone. Stop complainin'. We don't need this place. We can start our own company. I woke up this morning thinking why don't we do what the hell I said? We gonna start our own company. Andre : It'll never work, Mom. The business has changed completely since you and Dad started out. This could work. We just need a dope name. We've got Hakeem. All he has to do is record one more song for his album. Empire will never let us have that album. You heard Jamal. He's going to bury it. Let me deal with Jamal. All right, bye. Look, Mom, we need to go after Royale T, Ratzo and Tiana. No, I already talked to Tiana. She's down with us. We just gotta get you back into the studio. Okay, Mom, I'm so much more than just a rapper. Let me develop my own artists. I bet Anika can get V. No! No. Anika's out. I don't want to see her lying face, you understand me, Keem? I told V we'd get straight to work recording her new single, so... Are you sure Cookie wants me? Yeah, she definitely wants you. Pride of the Lyons is wack. It's a terrible name. Did you tell Mom you talked to Anika? Man, she don't want nothing to do with her, Thank you. but I told Anika to come anyway. Nah, I like Pride of the Lyons better. Look, we can call it whatever you want, baby, as long as you in it with me. I think you should reconsider Anika. She's one of the top A&Rs in the business. I don't care how good she is, I don't trust her ass. I just need you with me on this, baby. I'm thinking about it, Ma. Just give me a second to breathe. I actually think it could work. (phone line ringing) Cookie : Hello? Hey, Ma, I want to start a girl group like Destiny's Child. That's a great idea, Keem. Look, I think I got a space for us to rent if Andre can cut us a deal. Is Andre in? Well, he's gonna be. Look, just meet me at Ghetto Ass Studio tomorrow. She's kidding, right? Forget Lyon's Den, let's just call it The Pigsty. Man, we need a name like Em... Forget the name, okay? The name is beside the point. You ain't born with your name. You grow into it. Yeah, when we started Empire, we wasn't no Empire. Making music in Carol's living room until we graduated to a garage that was way grimier than this place. But see, it was those first few songs that planted the seeds. Then I had to sit on the sidelines and watch Lucious grow it into a multimillion-dollar company worthy of a name like Empire. It's my time. (chuckles) So whatever we call it, as long as Momma's got something to do with it, it's gonna live up to its name. Let's go. Man : You need what? I want to make a deal for using this space as our main base of operations. That's crazy. You crazy. Oh, I know I'm crazy. Everybody knows my mother's crazy. You're already in one of our studios.

I know what we need. 'Cause I wrote it. Okay, look, I am on your side. All right? Now, I understand that you're frustrated. I get it. You know what? I can't. V... V, wait, wait wait, wait. Beat it, boo boo kitty. I'm working with Veronica now. I don't even know why you here. Okay, let's hear it from the top. You know, this place remind me of the free clinic back in Philly. We all right over there? Uh... no, actually. I don't have your authorization form. What are you talking about? It was in your file when you got your meds, a few days ago. Now it's not. Oh, come on, man, I'm in here every week. I got myasthenia gravis. I sit down, you demonstrate on my vein... I need my meds, pops. Mr. Lyon, I can't dispense your meds without the authorization form or I'm gonna get fired. You gonna get worse than fired if you don't give me my meds right now. I need... Come on, Mr. Lyon. Oh, come on... Really? Really? Do I really gotta push the button? Come on, I know it ain't your fault. I know you gotta... There's nothing I can do about it. It's probably just a filing mistake.

I'm so happy you even want to talk to me. Oh, of course. Thank you. Who wouldn't? Okay. Man : Rolling! Jamal Lyon. Yes. Wow, look at you! (chuckles) Thank you for that incredible song. Thank you. And for inviting us into your gorgeous home. Of course. Any time. Yeah. We're so lucky  to have you here on Spilling the Tea. As you can see from our P.A. over there, who has a little crush on you, you have quite the female fans. Yeah, they're beautiful. I love them so much. How do you deal with that? How do you feel, having all of these women showering you with attention and going crazy over you? Men, as well, by the way. (laughs) It's great. I mean, we-we love, we love everybody. It's beautiful. It must be tough on relationships, though, right? No, I don't think so. Um, if, uh, if the relationship is solid. I don't... It doesn't cause jealousy? No, I don't... No. Sharon : His name is Michael. He's a little shy, but trust me, ladies, he is adorable. Plus, he cooked us the most amazing meal while we were setting up. But still, you know you're a lucky guy, Michael, right? Yeah. Jamal : Nah. No, no, I'm the lucky one. So, Jamal, can we expect a new album, a new Jamal Lyon album, any time soon? You know we're all waiting for it. Uh, I don't know about "soon." Uh... I am creating music. You know, it's my everything, and, you know, just been a little... I've been a little busy. You've been a little busy, haven't you? A little busy, yeah. But while your father is still awaiting trial... Mm-hmm? Can you talk to us about that? I know it must be hard for you. Yeah. Uh, I can't say too much about it, but, you know, I'm... just that I'm working on my music, a-as always, and making sure that I continue to make smart business decisions, you know. But, sure, what my dad is going through, (elevator bell dings) it's-it's hard. It's hard on us all. Yes, and that's why it's gonna take all of us to get through it. Uh, Jamal, I need to talk to you. Wait, isn't this your... This is my mother. I'm sorry, you guys. And his producer and manager, until a couple of hours ago. (anxious laugh) Cookie Lyon. We spoke on the phone, Sharon. Good to see you. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yeah, Mom. Let's go. Come on. I am trying to do an interview, in case you didn't notice. In case you have not noticed, I set up that interview. I have to get to the lawyer after this, to try to get my father out of jail, since you all bailed on him, so can we make this quick? Please? Look, I need to talk to you about Hakeem. Oh. Little baby traitor. He didn't do anything to hurt you, Jamal. He was hurt. By Lucious. And I know you know what that feels like. I need you to give Hakeem his album back. Why would I do that? (sighs) Jamal, you already won. You run the Empire. All Hakeem's got is his music. I know you. See, Lucious is trying to make you like him, but... you ain't him. (chuckles) So come on in here, walk me to these elevators. Show these cameras how good you're being to your mom. It's Mom. Can't say nothing to Mom. I'm sorry for the interruption. Sharon, it was good to see you, girl. Yeah. Sorry, Sharon. We just have some business to finish up. That's right. I'll be back. Oh, and, uh, Jamal... one last thing: I wanted to tell you first, before you hear it out here in these streets. Me, Andre and Hakeem, we're starting our own company. (men shouting, whooping) Man : Come on, man, don't let him by you like that! Clyde : You see this? Stayed in Iraq too long. First off all, we ain't had no business over there in the first place. Their infrastructure wasn't ready. Guy : You guys paying attention to Professor Clyde here, showing off about how much he reads the newspapers? That's what type of time we on. (men chuckle) Hey, Lucious, you finish writing that verse yet or what? Damn Skippy I did. Oh, man. Run that. Run that. Man, I get paid to perform. Man, you get paid to shut this whole place down. (laughing) All right. (clears throat) Oh, yeah. Hit me with a beat. I got it. ♪ Temperatures in the hundreds ♪

I'm not interested in being a part of a group. Thank you. We gave you a shot. (speaking Spanish) Let me just translate a bitch. With or without you, I shine. She crazy. I love her.

♪ One look and you made my heart go pop pop... ♪ Why you letting Hakeem launch a girl group? Excuse me. Don't knock your brother's hustle. No, Hakeem needs to be recording new music. Not wasting his time hitting on girls. That's how Jay-Z and your father built their careers. Besides, he gots a whole album ready to drop. On Empire, Mom. I spoke to Jamal and I asked him to give it back to Hakeem. Did he say yes? Not yet. Hakeem needs to be recording new music or the ship is gonna sink before it even leaves the port. (sighs) (whooping) Look, baby, if you trying to get your demo heard, this ain't how you go about it. Contrary to the little pack of lap dogs you got following you around up in here, you see not everybody's interested in being up your ass, Lyon. Then tell me what your interests are, McKnight. (imitating raspy voice): My interest is that your wheezing and your breath... (normal voice): I'm a little concerned about that. Is it, is it getting any better? (raspy): Oh, it's fine. I'm touched that y'all care. (chuckles) We don't care. Matter of fact, we-we could give a damn. You see, I think you make us all look bad. As far as I'm concerned, the world would be a better place without you in it. But the Federal Prosecutor, Ms. Roxanne Ford... she's more forgiving than me. And that medication of yours... It might just magically turn up if you just be a little more cooperative. Think about that. So, Tiana's in the big studio tomorrow, working on a new song. It'll be our first shot at releasing a single. Hakeem : Can I just worry about my girl group, please? You mean your personal speed dating service? Look, I haven't found my Beyoncé yet, but I found a couple girls that's really good. You know, but they're both Hispanic. Ain't nothing wrong with a couple of J-Lo's  as long as they can really sing. Well, damn. What is she doing here? What-what are you doing here? We need to talk about Vee. We don't need to talk about nothing. You need to get out. Why do you keep coming around? Andre : Mom, Mom... Don't nobody want you here, Anika! - Enough, enough! Hakeem, what's the problem with the two Latinas? Uh, look, I thought it'd be cool... We had one white girl, you know, one black girl and one Hispanic. I'm-a call 'em Rainbow Sensation. Boom... platinum album. That's the dumbest name I ever heard. Actually, that may be the dumbest name known to man. Did your daddy drop you on your head? Anika liked it. The concept, not the name. It's a marketable concept. Yeah... (chuckles) And Anika knows marketing. She made a whole career selling her ass. Oh, as opposed to you and your stellar career in pharmaceuticals? Let me tell you something, ho. If it weren't for women like me, bitches like you would spend a lifetime on their knees. Or underneath my 20-year-old son. Mom, it's none of your business who I get dirty with. Good luck. Hey, you need the luck, girl. I don't understand what part of "don't want you here" you don't get. There you go. All right, good. Thank you, brother. Appreciate it. I thinking about, uh, giving Hakeem back his album. With our stock plummeting. What kind of message that gonna send to the shareholders? That we're completely unthreatened by Cookie Lyon and her little startup. What are they calling it? It ain't got a name yet. 'Cause they plan on piggybacking off of mine. Hakeem belongs at Empire. If he wants his album heard, he gonna have to come back to the Empire. You got to make that happen. All right. (grunts) Dad, what's the matter? What's wrong with you? Nothing. Fine. In fact, I'm better than fine, man. I got this new melody that's... my own. I made my own heat. Yeah? I'm actually thinking about doing a Lucious Lyon joint from the joint. (both laughing) While I'm still in here. Be so dope, Dad. That gonna be epic. Beautiful. Hey, son. How you gonna do that up in here? Just get me, um, some basic recording equipment: a laptop... and, uh, they got a new thing... A mini twister. And they got a Step Up, too. Get me a Step Up, too. Man : (clears throat) Excuse me. Couldn't help overhearing. My name is Thurston Rawlings. Friends call me Thirsty. I think I could be of some service. Purple suit, no cross talk! Okay. Oh, you're a lawyer, huh? We got a lawyer, man. Thank you. I don't doubt that, but if you don't mind me asking, when's the last time they got you a bail hearing? And where did you go to law school, Mr., uh, Rawlings? University of Guam. Now, I know it's not Harvard, but... same curriculum, different campus. You're preaching to the choir, man. Harvard ain't done nothing for me these days. You think you can do better, Thirsty? Jamal : Wait... I wouldn't waste your time, Mr. Lyons. Hey, you, you're out of bounds! I'm sorry, man, hold on one second. I ain't trying to knock nobody's hustle, but... University of Guam with the... the discount suit? Thirsty : Really? No disrespect, son, but I don't think Ms. Roxanne Ford gives a damn where I shop. Do you? What do you know about her? Withholding your meds? That's one of her stunts. She's trying to get you to cop a guilty plea. Mama plays dirty, but I got no qualms getting in the mud with her. Discount suit and all. Officer : All right, let's go. Yes, I am ready to go, Officer. Thank you very much. Set up a meeting.

Empire is everything to him, and, without it, he's completely lost. Yeah, well, then why is he doing the whole thing with my mom and Hakeem like that? I know, I know. But that's not him. That's not who he is. Look, Andre messed up. Obviously. He knows that. But I'm asking you, as his brother, to find it in your heart to forgive him. Because all he wants is to be back at Empire with you and Lucious at the company that he gave his entire life and heart to. I miss him, too, Rhonda, I do. There's just so much stuff that I'm handling now. Trust me, I'd give anything to be able to just hand that off to Andre. (anxious laugh) The reason I'm not drinking is because I'm pregnant. We're having a baby. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. I mean, obviously I'm-a talk to Lucious now. Really? Really? Of course. Uncle Jamal. Uncle Jamal. What they know about Uncle Jamal?

♪♪ (humming melody) (music track fades, as singers hum melody solo) That's a great session, man. That's a Lucious Lyon hit right there. I wish Clyde was here. Good thing I got to work early or you degenerates might have got away with this trash. Come on, man, we just trying to make a little music. You out of bounds, inmate. With contraband! Lock 'em up! All of 'em! We already locked up, brother. I'm not your brother, inmate. We was just talking about your ass. Is that right? Talk about it in the hole. McKnight : How does it feel to be in there now, huh? You rap like you some sort of tough guy. But in here, you just another prisoner. Matter of fact, I could kill you right now. Wouldn't be no consequences. Just another dead rapper. You sure about that, baby blue? Oh, I'm sure. 'Cause, see, I'm all about the consequences. I got consequences from uptown to downtown, from the five boroughs to the seven continents, that know each and every person in this world that you care about. You threatening me, inmate? Nah, no threats. Just stating the obvious. 'Cause that's not a violation. That's a new charge. You gonna get hit with more years than all your gold and platinum records combined. Nah, that's where you're mistaken, 'cause I'm not getting convicted. You know why? Let me guess. 'Cause you innocent, right? No... since when does that matter? I'm not getting convicted because people like you and that bitch Miss Ford, y'all make mistakes. I don't. (tires screeching) (grunting) (blows smacking) Where is it? Don't know what you talking about. The music, scumbag. You sure everything is on there? Yeah, I double-checked before we cracked his ribs. All right, you two take a dance class. Yes, sir. Uh, what is it that you wanted to talk to me about, Andre? Hakeem : Hey, Ma, I need to talk to you. Save it, baby. I already know your father and your brother Jamal are trying to get you back to Empire, and I guess I got to understand. So you saying you want me to go back to Empire? No, it's breaking my heart, but I can't stop you. Taking your Rainbow Abomination with you? Rainbow Sensation ain't happening. I found three chicks I like, but they all Latina and feisty. You are aware that the English-speaking Latino market is the fastest-growing, largest, untapped market in the country, right? An all-Latina girl group, that could be huge, man. Really? Yep. So we may have something here, if I can get Valentina on our team instead of Empire. I thought you were going back? I'm not going back to Empire. I'm not working for Dad or Jamal punk-ass. I'm gonna be hip-hop legendary in my own right. So you giving up on your album? Did I say that? Check this out. Chicken, do it. Your boy is going for the crown. My album, the one Empire wasn't gonna drop, I just leaked it online. Are you crazy? Isn't that illegal? I don't know and I don't care. You don't know and you don't care? Are you stupid? Are you? Empire is gonna sue the hell out of you. Uh... And they'd be right to. I don't care if they sue us. I don't care if I lose money from it. All I care about is that my music is out to the world and that it's gonna be legendary. Chicken : You right. That's it. I'm done. Andre! I don't care. Andre! Andre! Andre... Andre! You worry too much. There is no way Jamal gonna sue his own brother. No, no, you don't worry enough, Cookie. I'm sorry, Mom. Okay, it's not you, it's not, it's not even Hakeem. This isn't me. This is a scrappy little setup. It's not what I've been working for all these years. It's not what I want. My heart is not in this, Mom. Please... I need you to let me go. Let me go, Mom. No. Mom... Andre, please. I need you... I need you. Let me go, Mom. Andre... Let me go. Let me go. (sniffles) This room is full of Torahs. I copped the building from the Vizhnitz Dynasty. The Fishnets who? It's a Jewish thing, a Hasidic dynasty. You see them all over this neighborhood, the crazy dudes with the curlicues and the big black hats. Dynasty, hmm. That's a dope name. So are you saying this space is available? The whole floor? Might be, if it means getting you out of my face. (chuckles) Yeah, this could work. As soon as you clean this place up, of course. Actually, since you'll be the one renting it, that'll be your ass doing the cleaning. (giggles) Mazel tov. (lock buzzes in distance) I hear you want to come back to Empire. I never should've been a part of that hostile takeover. I messed up big-time, Pop, and I know it. Hurt me to my core to watch you take sides against me, son. Empire's in my blood. When I bleed, I bleed Empire. Now, I'm ask... I'm praying... that you'll forgive me, Pop. You still going to church? Yes, sir, yes, sir, every Sunday. Still believe in God? Yes, sir. Good. Then you pray to God that He forgives you, 'cause I don't. Pop, wait a minute. Pop! Pop! For years, you rejected Jamal because of who he is. Now he's running the company. Hakeem, he slept with your fiancée. Apparently, you want him back at Empire. Here I stand, contrite, remorseful, humble. And yet you look at me... like I'm some kind of mutant. Why do you hate me? Woman : Dwight, why are you so sad, baby? You want me to sing you a song? What song do you want me to sing? Hmm, "Itsy Bitsy Spider"? Again? Okay. ♪ The itsy bitsy spider ♪

We'll do more stuff together. That's what I miss. Yeah, me, too. But I ain't coming back to Empire. What about your album? What about it? I put it out. I leaked it online. Seriously? So that's how we gonna roll, Hakeem? Yeah? You'll never see a penny. We'll sure the drawers off your black ass. That's exactly why I'm not coming back to your stupid-ass Empire. But tell Father when I get to Madison Square Garden, I'm-a comp y'all some VIP tickets. I got y'all. You ain't gonna sell out the Garden. Not yet, but I will. And guess what, we got a name. It's called Lyon Dynasty. (sighs) That's corny. Get up out of here. You corny. Jamal, you think you on top now, our little Dynasty's gonna crush your Empire. ♪ Oh, no, chain on froze ♪

That's why we got to hurry up and get this thing together before he gets out of jail. Come on. ♪ You know I know it...! ♪ (protesters chanting outside) Roxanne : Your Honor, this is unacceptable. If the defense counsel isn't present  at the bail hearing that he called,  then he's wasting our time. The hell kind of lawyer doesn't show up for his own hearing? (protestors continue chanting outside) Woman (outside) : Let him go! (Roxanne scoffs) Man (outside) : you let Lucious go! Man 2 (outside) : Let him go! (protestors continue shouting) Thirsty : I'm here! I'm here, I'm here, Your Honor. Judge Robbins : I was this close to throwing your client back in jail, Mr. Rawlings. My docket's backed up enough as it is. The court still validates, right? I-I got the new evidence right here. Just bring it straight up here. Does counsel think he's not going to share this new evidence with the prosecutor? I wouldn't think of it, Ms. Ford. Thank you. Judge Robbins : I think I've... seen enough. This court finds that Mr. Lyon poses no flight risk and rules to release him on bail... What?! Your Honor, this is a travesty! (camera shutters clicking) The people will not stand by while you... That is my ruling, Ms. Ford. Bail is granted at one million dollars. Roxanne : Your Honor!
