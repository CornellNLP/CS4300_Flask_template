 Previously on Empire...  
 Baby, come back in. Get up out of my house! You still with Anika? I was never with Anika. You feeling me? No! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on to you... you forgive me? Meet your new Gutter Life president Mr. Andre Lyon! Pryce : He's testing you. I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son. Amen! You got something and it don't come around every day. Let me help you do something with it. You are the fifth promoter I met with. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. Drop it, bitch! Who sent you? Thirsty! Quit trying to steal our tracks. Cookie and Lucious got beef, but that ain't got nothing to do with you. You need her. More importantly, she loves you. Welcome to Lyon Dynasty. You want to chillax here, you gonna pay tax here. What is this?! (tires screech) ♪ ♪ A'ight, let's go! Let's go! Where you taking me? Hey, just pull his ass out. Hurry up! Get off me! Shut up! Damn, you put it on me, girl. (laughing) You put it on me. I know. (laughs) I got to get some sleep before work. Well, we ain't slept yet. I want to stay up with you all day, but, um, I got to go. I got to go to work early and prepare for my meeting with my new boss Andre. You could be a few minutes late. I can't be a second late. You keep that leg right there, you gonna end up late. Oh, no. I should go. You got this, baby. Can't no man knock you off of your game. No man? Not unless his name is J Poppa. Oh, who's that... ? Keem, this is my fifth time calling you. Now, you better not be ducking me. Laz got you the headline spot for the Big Apple Jam. Okay, that's big, Keem. That's big for you. And the Lyon Dynasty. So you need to get your ass down here to rehearse. I got Destiny's Problem Child looking for their lead man, so if that's still you, I suggest you hit my back ASAP! You wonder why Gladys ever had the Pips, right? (laughs) Who? Seriously? Y'all need to stay off y'all's cell phones and quit all that Tinderoni and Grinding, and learn some history...  Porsha? Porsha? Shut up, please. Thank you. Okay, until Hakeem gets here, Ladies, we need to run the song. We need to work on the song. So, Laura, take it from the top, Porsha. The top of what, Cookie? We already did the intro, the chorus. Hakeem comes in right after. Right, okay. Excuse me for a second. Just, uh... Hakeem Lyon, get your black ass down here. Well, okay, Miss Thing. Since you already know the choreography, let me see it. Okay. ♪ Three, four, five, six... ♪ Hey, Cookie, you should let me spit Hakeem verse. You know, just to get them into it. I got skills... No, you don't. I do. No, you don't and you need to stop asking. 'Cause in a minute, you gonna be asking for a new job somewhere else, see, 'cause I should've fired your dumb ass, like, ten times alre... (phone rings) See, wait. Finally. What the hell?

For one, you know the Staples Center didn't hit me back. Wait, hold on, hold on. Hey, hey! Give me a, give me a minute. Give me a minute. Take a break. Question is... is it in your head or is it in your heart? I don't know, man, I just... I'm so disgusted with myself since Michael cheated. Fidelity ain't, everybody ain't made for it. Yeah, but that's past shady. He up on my balcony with his little thing hanging out... No, no, no, I don't need to know the details, I don't need... All you need to know is that the Staples Center, there's no way they gonna pass on you. And regarding Michael, you got to put that into the music, man. Come on. Engineer? (piano playing) ♪ Made the choice to play the field ♪

♪ You like to voice... ♪ Now I knew there was some low-ass levels I am working! You would go to, Lucious. But this, this is some otherworld lowness. Look what he had done to your brother. What? I didn't do this. This ain't me, Cookie. Oh, my God. They really snatched him. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, baby, damn! I know what this is. I know what this is. Come on, come with me. Yeah, I'm coming, too. Cookie : No! The further away from this for you the better. They will take you, too. Are you kidding me? I'm coming! No! You're gonna stay right here. Get your ass down, man! We should've taken the more famous brother. The one with talent. This one here is probably worth 50 cents on Jamal Lyon's dollar. What, y'all some cowboys? What, y'all a bunch of punk-ass cowboys?! Well, my name Hakeem... What was that, you little bitch? Huh? Huh?! Yeah, we gonna get him back okay. How do you know? How do you know, Lucious? 'Cause they only asked for $40,000. If this was some long-term or they gonna hurt him or kill him... Don't say that! Don't say that! I'm just saying it's a simple snatch and grab. "Snatch and grab"... Really, Lucious? You know where we come from ain't no such thing as no snatch and grab; they snatch your ass, it's a wrap. Yeah, well, things done changed. Nobody gets bodied these days. You know, this is just somebody trying to do a simple hustle and they flexing on you. Flexing on me?! Why me? Because you're a rookie to the block and they want to remind you. Look, don't forget, they know that you're my baby mama and they know that he's related to me, so whatever happens, we're gonna get our boy back, I swear. (cell phone ringing) Okay. Go ahead. That's them. Hello? Yep, we got the money. We at the drop-off! No, no, hold on, hold on, hold on. Look, before we go any further, I want to know that there's proof of life. Proof... ? Proof that he's okay. (quietly): Proof of life?! Lucious and Cookie Lyon, I'm still alive. This video is proof of life. I'm still here. Yeah, I see it. We're good, so... where do you want it? Yeah, I see the welding spot... all right. All right, thank you. What was that, Lucious? We're good to go. Uh-huh. What was that? You said this was just a snatch and grab. What is "proof of life"? Th... there's always variables. Look, it's a different time now, baby. Just stay calm. They said they gonna drop him about three blocks west of here. This is the drop spot for them. As we start rebranding Gutter Life with me as president, I'd like to get to know our roster. We listed all the artists, the tickets sales, digital downloads, tour grosses and the algorithms. Mathematically, you can see where our artists rank against other independent labels of the same size. I already know the numbers. But that's not where it starts. Is it, Becky? Of course not. It starts with talent and drive and having something... You don't have to recite what you learned from your Empire intern manual. Not here for that. This all has to mean something, ladies and gentlemen. Now what if we based our roster on the wealth of an individual's character, as well as their bottom line? Becky, can you set up a meeting for me with each of these artists? I'd like to get them to know before I start pruning the tree. Of course. If they're not up to standard... the new standard of Gutter Life... we have to drop them. Don't make any sudden moves when the drop-off car gets here. Okay. Okay? Just stay calm. Okay, here here they go. Okay. Now, this is on their terms, let them make the release. All right, all right. Cookie! No. He's not here! Lucious, Hakeem not here! Hey, baby... Hey, get your ass out! Hey! Hey, man! Hey, man, where my son?! Where's my son? Hey, man, I don't know your son, man! Look, homeboy asked to be let out. And you let him out?! Listen, two dudes paid me a G to drive this van. What did they look like? I... I don't know. What? What? Uh-uh! Shake him... Please! Please! Please! They gave me a phone, all right? And directions... I swear, that's all. Cookie : Shut up, bitch! Where did our son go, Lucious? Where's Hakeem? (siren wailing in distance) ♪ ♪ Mama, stop. Stop, stop, stop talking about how everything's gonna be fine, how I'm gonna be okay, because clearly, I'm not. No, I have nothing! I have no one. Good-bye, Mom. Hakeem, what are you... ? What are you doing? (sighing) ♪ ♪ Look, Keem, I know you mad, but we're trying to help. We can't do that if you don't let us in. I understand you've been through an ordeal, Hakeem, and I'm just gonna check you over. I'm straight. Thank you. Stop lying, boy. Jamal : Hakeem, what happened? Man, you all right? I said I'm straight. Andre : You need something, bro? I don't need nothing 'cept for all y'all to fall back. Tell your mother where you disappeared for five hours. Hakeem, can you see out of your eye? Is there anything that you can recall? I'm good, yo! Why don't you let me determine if there are any injuries, then we can go from there. I got nothing but a jacked eye. That's it. I'd like to see if there are any signs of any other kind of abuse. I'm out of here, yo. Cookie : No. No, you're gonna take your ass in the dining room and let the doctor do his job. (phone buzzing) Cookie : Uh... Why is she blowing up your phone? H... Leave him alone, Mama. Mama. Would you please take off your jacket? (sighing) Lucious, I recommended a couple of stitches for the eye, but it will close with those butterfly bandages. Other than that, there's no serious injuries. Boy's very lucky. Doc... here. I owe you. Thank you. You're welcome. Cookie : Hakeem, what is wrong with you? You can't tell we was worried about your ungrateful ass? I'm just ready to go. I need a ride. Lucious : No, what happened to you, son, is my worst nightmare. Hakeem : It can't be worse than the nightmare of being your son. No. I ain't your mama. Watch how you talk to me. Gotta watch nothing. We in here tripping like we some white picket fence family. Tell yourself whatever you need so you can go to sleep, but recognize none of this would've gone down if I wasn't your son. This is because of you and you. What? Boy... No, no, no. Let him go. Let him go. He's just humiliated right now. Give him a few days. Staples Center passed on me. What? They claim that I am "too narrow of an artist to fill their stadium." That's code word for gay. And I'm sorry, Dad, that's because Empire keeps on marketing me as a gay artist. But that's what you are. That's not what I am. I'm gay and I'm an artist, but that don't make me a gay artist, and you of all people should understand that. (door slams) And I'm gonna tell you this much, Dad: I'm gonna fire the whole damn marketing team, Steve Cho and all them suckers, if they don't get it together. No, you're not gonna fire anybody. You're gonna take that passion, you're gonna put it into the song. Can you start it from, um, right before the third hook, middle part of the, the high part? Thank you. (music begins) ♪ Go to hell ♪

You do want that, right? D... don't worry about what I want or what my son wants. You know what, I didn't need this clown in my life. You don't need him in yours. What is this? Your father almost signed with me after he left Beretti. Till he found out I was gay. Oh. No, I didn't know that. Well, look, times have changed. Exactly. That's why you don't need him. You don't even work with artists anymore, do you? You're just a rich dude that throws these lavish parties and tries to manipulate political candidates. That's right, Lucious. I am devoting the rest of my life to making the world a better place for LGBT people. And I want to help you, Jamal. And he's on the board of the Staples Center, Dad. Look, Mal, there's all kinds of vampires in this business. Some suck your blood, others will suck your... Dad, don't d... Nuh-uh. Don't do that. The day I found out that Lucious Lyon had a gay son is the day that I knew, I knew right then and there, that there was a God. Okay, see, nuh-uh. All of this back and forth is not gonna go down. Whatever issue that you two have with each other is between the both of you, okay? Jamieson, I brought you on board because Empire is marketing me in a niche way. Yeah. Dad, I have to undo that. Period. I say we put the past behind us. Jamal is a major talent, poised to break all kinds of barriers, and I would be honored to use all of my influence to help pave that way.

How you gonna tell me, man? I know the song I wrote. How the hell y'all think y'all ready with y'all voices sounding like static? Who is your musical inspirations? EPMD, KRS-One, Public Enemy, any other hardcore Negro not afraid to take it to the streets. If you could change one thing about hip-hop today, what would it be? (snapping gum) You think hip-hop loves women? You do know what "P-Busta" stand for, right, playa? Any other revenue streams you think we should explore in order to best tap your fan base? So, J Poppa, instead of asking questions, let me just cut to the quick. I'm assuming the "J" in "J Poppa" stands for "joints"? "Jewels"? "Jigga"? Nah, man. It's 'cause my first name is Job. As in the Book of Job? "I know that my redeemer lives, and that, in the end, he shall stand on the earth." Job 19:25. I'm a PK. Well, actually, I'm a Preacher's Grandkid. So that's where the "Poppa" comes from. A man's gotta show some love to Grampoppa for keeping me off the streets and letting me work on my music. You ever think about incorporating the Word into your music? You could reach a lot more people with the light than you can with the darkness, brother. Are you for real? Oh, yeah. Let's do business. It's gonna be fun. Lucious : You know this business, Cookie. Y'all damn near asked for it. Maybe you're just not cut out for this part of the hustle. He's your son, Lucious. And he got hurt. Baby, you know there are two kinds of security in hip-hop. There's the house dog and then there's the junkyard dog. And if you gonna make it in this game, you need both of them. And the only reason you ain't had to think about none of this is because I've created this blanket of security with Empire.  So you gonna use this as a way to say we need to give up and crawl back to you? No, I don't want you back, Cookie. Just Hakeem. And if you love him like you say you love him, Cookie, you're gonna want that for him. Listen, baby, these wolves, they done sunk they teeth into you. They ain't gonna let go until they open up a vein, and when they open it up, they're never lettin' it close. And you gonna learn the hard way why you need somebody like me in your corner. (scoffs) You just gonna leave us to the wolves? So you can prove your little stupid point? You ain't a boss, Lucious. You's a busta. Cookie... Cookie, my ass. Mm-mm. Hmph.

(chuckles) Lucious didn't set this up, but he might as well have 'cause this is playing right into his hands. (sighs) I need to get a security team in place. Hear me out, right? Before you say anything. What if you hired the cats that snatched Hakeem and jacked Tiana? Are you stupid? (chuckles) You being serious? Yeah. I told you I was a cop, right? Mm-hmm. 15 years ago, when I was a rookie on the job, there was a rash of these quick grabs, right? All of them in the rap industry. And department was chasing its own tail, trying to figure out who's pulling this off, and it turns out right when we got it locked down, they all just stopped. And you know why? 'Cause the labels put 'em on payroll. They were hitting 'em off legitimately, 'cause it's easier that way for everybody. "Legitimately." House dogs and junkyard dogs. (sighs) No, no, I don't want those wolves in my house. No. Then hire ex-cops at Lyon Dynasty. I... No. I don't mess with cops. Oh, no offense. Nah, none taken. (clicks tongue) Guess I just got to pay someone then. Uh, if those wolves get into your house, I got you. (scoffs) You gonna be my wolf slayer, hon? That's right. Wolves, dragons. Dragons. Lions.

I'm starting to worry about him too. Maybe I should just cancel the Big Apple Jam. Why would you do that? Don't do that. Andre and I will get Hakeem. Make him come around. You just keep the train on the rail. It's kind of a big deal for the Lyon Dynasty. It's nice that you said that. Let's just hope that Hakeem comes to his senses and knows what a big opportunity you set up. Thanks, Jamal. I set up a meet with the guys who snatched Hakeem. I'm taking him with me. The boy needs to feel like a man again. You clear on what we're doing, right? You're running the meet. Yeah, and I'm letting you get your come-up. But you gonna be good? You gonna be good? Yeah, Mom.

This is my artist. Our stocks haven't recovered from your prison stint, from the Fed raid... she is too much of a liability for a public company, Pop. Now, remember how Seagram's had to drop Death Row even though Death Row was making, what, a hundred million a year? Look, tomorrow you and your MBA number crunchers can sit down and figure out who you want to drop from the roster... She's not one of them. You put me in charge. No, I put you in place.

Shake your ass. Shake it. A lot. I like that. s*x sells. Remember that. Every note you hit, you do it like your life depends on it. You understand me? 'Cause it damn near does. Laura : We know when we're coming in, right? Yeah, yeah, we got it, we got it. Does Hakeem got it, though? He better. (distorted): ♪ ... mess up... keep on mess up ♪ Come here. Why are you driving yourself? 'Cause ever since I got out the joint, I don't like people telling me where to go. Look, um... check out this song I wrote. ♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪ 
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪ 
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪ 
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang... ♪ I told you, I don't need no tracks from you. This ain't for you; this is about you. Look, the way I see it, I can keep banging my head up against this wall hoping that you're gonna learn something  that I want you to know, or I can let you bang your own head until eventually,  you're gonna pay attention. And when that moment happens... And I'm praying that it's happening right now... you're gonna realize that it ain't about black eyes and bloody noses in this business, it's about life or death. And that's what this track reflects. ♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪ 
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom... ♪ No strings. ♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪ 
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪ 
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪ 
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom... ♪ Hey, Dad... with you, there's always strings. Or more like ropes that choke everybody around you. ♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

♪ ♪ Hakeem, are you okay? Hakeem? Cookie : No, no, no, no, no. Do you know where you come in at? Don't worry about... Hakeem! Cookie : Hey! Ladies, get the hell out of here. Yo, I didn't ask you to come... Next time you turn your back on me... Oh! ... I'm gonna break it! Um, shut up. Lucious, look, that is not the way you're gonna get through to him. No, I offered the boy an olive branch. And the Pilgrims offered the Indians a bunch of blankets. Oh, you want to man up now? Next time you pull a gun, drop the hammer down. No, no, no. There will be no next... There will be no next time. You understand me? Lucious, what do you want? You want your own son to trade places with you in lock-up, dummy? If that's what it takes for him to grow a sack, so be it. Oh, come on in, boys. Your father's giving a lovely lesson about how the whole family could end up behind bars. No, I'm giving a lesson on how to man the hell up instead of wallowing in self-pity and bitch ass-ness. You gonna use my name, put some... put some... put a man behind it. Jamal : Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad... Come on, come on. We got this, all right? Both of y'all, get out. What? You two are the problem. Okay, just leave us alone with our brother. Give us a shot. Y'all want to be left alone, fine. Done. Mom. You, too. ♪ ♪ Hakeem? Hakeem, I swear you do not have to go out there right now. We can take you out of here right now, start fresh tomorrow. Whatever you need, we're here. When the dudes pinned me up... I ain't do nothing. I ain't fight back. I wasn't strong. Yeah, but you are alive. You're smart. You kept your cool, and you're good, so, for that, you're stronger and smarter than anybody else on the block. Man, the three of us... we can't be broken. Not by thugs or kidnappers or anything else that comes at us. You know why? Why? Because we already beat the odds by surviving as the children of Lucious and Cookie Lyon. You already ahead of the game. Jamal : Come on, man. Remember when you were little, and you'd always stick up for me, and you was a little French fry? Hell, I remember you backing down dudes who were twice your size for me. You're a better man than your father already. Braver, too. I mean, come on. You really think Dre and I would react any differently if your situation? Nah, y'all both punks. Go on. Set your ass... Get over here, boy. You got this, all right?
