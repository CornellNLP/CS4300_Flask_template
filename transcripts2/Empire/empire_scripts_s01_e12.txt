 ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 
 Your brother and I have been working hard to turn Empire into a publicly traded company. 
 Now, part of us going public means insuring a legacy for this company and right now, it seems none of you are prepared to take over after I'm gone. 
 Now, it won't happen today, nor tomorrow, but I will start grooming someone soon. 
 And it can only be one of you. 
 Yesterday, a miracle happened. 
 (laughing) 
 My doctor told me I don't have ALS. 
 I was misdiagnosed. 
 What I got is serious, but it's not fatal. 
 You're not dying? 
 I've been given a second chance at life. 
 God, Dad, that's amazing. 
 Yeah, it's a miracle, son. 
 I mean, I woke up this morning... so conscious of all the harm I've done to each and every one of y'all. 
 I'm not asking y'all to forgive me. 
 Just open up the gifts. 
 I don't want nothing from you. 
 Just, please, open it. 
 Lucious : Those wings... 
 They are an emblem of Empire's jet fleet. 
 I should've never tried to control you. 
 That was wrong. 
 And I'm sorry about Camilla. 
 So when your album drops, you'll have your own jet to tour anywhere you want. 
 And don't let me or anybody else ever try and control you again. 
 Lucious : That's the Lion of Judah, because you knew exactly what I was doing when I tried to take Michelle. 
 I was just trying to break your faith,  like it had been done to me. 
 And that was wrong. 
 So when the IPO closes on Friday, I'm going to announce the start of the Lyon Foundation and you're going to have $100,000,000 at your disposal. 
 Son... 
 Lucious : The empire is yours, Jamal. 
 Heard you were looking for me. 
 Lucious : Hey. 
 Gathered everybody together to, um, share with them the good news. 
 What good news? 
 I was misdiagnosed. 
 The angel of death came to get me and I got me a reprieve. 
 Can you believe it? 
 That is great news, Lucious. 
 That is really good news. 
 Right, boys? That's good news. 
 So you're really happy I'm not dying? 
 (laughing): I am happy. 
 Hallelujah. 
 Lucious : I got everyone gifts. 
 The boys opened theirs. 
 Come open yours. 
 A gift? 
 (laughs nervously) 
 What'd you get? 
 Jamal : Thanks, Becky. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Uh, y'all want anything? 
 I'm good. Yeah. Go crazy. 
 This'll be the last cup of tea I serve any of you. 
 Jamal has promoted me to A&R. 
 Yeah. 
 Becky : Mm-hmm! 
 Yeah! 
 (grunting, laughing) 
 Congratulations, Becky. 
 Thanks. 
 Congratulations. I've been meaning to ask you, what type of black girl named "Becky"? 
 Oh, my mom's white. 
 So what's the deal, boss man? 
 Tell me, man. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
 Come on, stop all of that. 
 It ain't even like that. 
 I don't know, y'all... 
 I feel like he really loves us. 
 I do. 
 You know what I mean? 
 He built this whole empire for us. 
 Hell of a gift he gave you. 
 Hakeem : I don't understand. 
 If Dad not dyin', why he even pick a successor? 
 It don't make no sense. 
 Because we are a company that's about to go public. 
 And what it does is that it saves us in case some random white dude wants to come and try to buy it from under us. Right, Dre? 
 Shareholders like to know there's a succession plan, sure. 
 Point is, I need y'all's support. 
 You know, I don't think I even want to do it if I don't have it. 
 So if we're not cool with it, you're not gonna do it? 
 Is that what you saying? 
 What I'm saying is that I'm not him and you know that. 
 You know, every single decision that I make... 
 Every single decision that  you  make? 
 Yeah, Dre. 
 I mean, you're the MBA, so tell me if you ever heard of a corporation where the buck doesn't stop somewhere. 
 Hakeem : But what about my album? 
 Will I be in charge of how my album gets dropped and what gigs I do to promote it? 
 Hell, yeah. 
 I-I mean... 
 You know, I do think that your album should be pushed back, just, like, one to two months... 
 No, I... my album is supposed to come out the day the IPO come out. 
 All right. 
 But it's not smart programming to push your album when my album is still climbing the charts, so let my situation die down a little bit... and then Dad says he wants to release an album, but that's not definite, so we'll-we'll figure it out. 
 We will. 
 We will? 
 Yes. 
 Perfect.

 That's great. So you got everything you wanted, right? 
 You said a faggot... As you called him... 
 Would one day run this company. 
 Well, that's what you got. 
 That's about all you gettin'. 
 That ain't all she getting. You made a deal. 
 You let her back in the company. 
 That was before. 
 Before what? 
 Before your mother tried to murder me. 
 (Jamal and Cookie chuckle) 
 You know your father's a pathological liar. 
 Well, thanks to your little boyfriend Malcolm, I can prove everything I'm saying. 
 You see, I had security cameras installed in every room in my house. 
 Checkmate, bitch. 
 That's... 
 (laughs) 
 Jamal... 
 Jamal, that's not what it looks like, okay, baby? 
 (gasps) 
 Ma... 
 Listen to me. 
 Your father killed Bunkie. 
 He killed Bunkie. Do you hear me? 
 Jerome! 
 Lucious killed Bunkie. 
 He ki... 
 Hey. Get your hands off of me! 
 He killed your cousin Bunkie. 
 He'll kill anybody! Watch your back, baby! 
 Like you watched mine? 
 You see, son, sometimes you gotta be willing to sacrifice your queen in order to win the game. 
 Hi, Cookie. 
 Get in the car. 
 Get off of me! 
 I know my rights! 
 Get in the car, Ms. Lyon. 
 Go. 
 (tires squealing) 
 Lucious : Vernon Turner is back and all the world is right again. 
 Appreciate you coming to get me. 
 Oh, no, man. 
 I got an IPO to launch. 
 I got a concert sold out. 
 And a black man's still alive. 
 I got my man back, too. 
 I needed you. 
 I just want you to know that... 
 No, no, no. 
 Can the wishy-washy stuff, man. 
 We got, we got business to do. 
 You got to look after Cookie for me. 
 How's she doing? 
 She's got it in for me... I'll show you the security cam footage; she really wasn't happy about a brother having good health. 
 Put it that way. 
 So we are building a case against Lucious right here. 
 And we would very much like your cooperation. 
 You ain't dragging me into that. 
 I don't got to do it... I know my rights. 
 Absolutely. 
 Anyway, we already have a witness. 
 You ever heard of Shyne Johnson? 
 Nope, don't know who you're talking about. 
 Lucious :  I killed you Bunkie, just like Shyne's boys. 
 You kept threatening me with the wise men. 
 Nelson : We busted Shyne on about a thousand different counts, and he's trying to cut a deal to give us Lucious. 
 He says that, um, Lucious killed your cousin Bunkie Williams. 
 Tell us what you know, Cookie. 
 Come on. 
 We know your husband's the one really running the show. 
 If you testify against him, we'll reduce your sentence. 
 You're looking at 25 years, Cookie. 
 Give us Lucious, and it'll be less than five. 
 Carter : We know that you want to see Lucious go down. 
 Well, here's your chance. 
 Find yourself another snitch. 
 I fulfilled my obligation with you. 
 Taxi! 
 Taxi...! 
 Okay, we both wanted to hurt him, and we did that. 
 All right? 
 But Creedmoor, that's never gonna be my company. 
 I want Empire. 
 A Curious Mind. 
 This is an inspirational book, Hakeem. 
 I'm... I'm happy you're reading this. 
 You know who else you should read? 
 Who? 
 Machiavelli. 
 I already read that. 
 You talking about the Italian guy, he be writing books about power. 
 Hmm. 
 So that means that you also know that he had a disdain for what he called "effeminate princes." 
 I'm not letting Jamal go out like that. 
 Oh, come on, Keem, I'm not talking about Jamal being gay. 
 I'm talking about a battle we can win. 
 You are gonna be a much better king, now that you have to fight for it. 
 Fight for what? 
 Have you ever heard of a hostile takeover? 
 We're gonna need Andre. 
 And you got to be cool, Keem. 
 With Jamal, the concert, everything. 
 Think you can handle it? 
 ♪ That's what the DJ spins ♪ 
 Announcer : Everyone, please take your places. 
 The press conference will be starting in three minutes. 
 (reporters clamor for Lucious) 
 You don't have a problem with Cookie you think you have. 
 I trailed her myself. 
 Only thing she's done, besides sit down and eat, is see her PO. 
 But the real problem is... 
 Rita Ora's pulled out of the show. 
 Because of Cookie. 
 Team Cookie all the way, homie. 
 Let me holla at you real quick. 
 Yeah. Look, we not letting him treat us like punks no more. 
 You hear me? 
 You ever heard of a hostile takeover? 
 Accept that Jamal won. 
 Why you looking so nervous? 
 (hesitant laugh) 
 I can't believe I'm here. 
 I mean, with all these stars. 
 You are the star. 
 I want you out, front and center. 
 You know my song, "Whatever Makes You Happy"? 
 Yeah, I grew up on that song. 
 Then you should be singing it. 
 Titan, this is Michelle White, one of the greatest gospel singers I've ever met. 
 She's gonna do "Whatever Makes You Happy." 
 That's the one. 
 Hey. Come on. 
 That's your star. 
 Sorry... you have to start the press conference now. 
 Okay. 
 You're gonna love her, baby. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, we have a Philadelphia native here with us tonight. 
 You call her a legend. 
 I call her a goddess. 
 Miss Patti Labelle has agreed to be a part of our show. 
 I have an announcement to make. 
 Uh, all the artists participating in "The Lucious Lyon Sound," we've all agreed to give ten percent of our proceeds to "Black Lives Matter." 
 Okay, we got time for a couple questions. 
 (reporters clamor for Lucious) 
 Lucious, with your IPO closing on the same day as your concert, how are you going to manage your music and running a public company? 
 Well, fortunately for me, I have my son, Jamal, - MAN: Yo! 
 Who's now the vice-chairman... I got something to say about all of that! 
 Jamal : All right. 
 Everybody, please give it up for Black Rambo. 
 He'll be performing at The Lucious Lyon Sound concert with... 
 Black Rambo : Wait... what?! 
 I'm not performing nothing if you running Empire, batty man. 
 The hell you just call me? - Wait, wait, wait, hold up, hold up. 
 Black Rambo : It's the death of hip-hop... 
 That's enough. You can leave now. 
 I'll go, and so should every real emcee on your roster. 
 Gonna put a fairy on the billboard... 
 Hey, get his ass up out of here. 
 Last time I checked, hip hop was born from the struggle of real men. 
 Or did you forget all that? 
 Ain't no place in this game for them bitches. 
 Look, if we publically attack Black Rambo, he'll respond and dominate the news cycle right up to the concert. 
 Jamal : No, and that's exactly what I don't want. 
 The concert stays about Dad. 
 I'll release a statement, saying that bigotry has no place at Empire, and that we welcome Black Rambo's exit. 
 It's perfect. 
 Simple. 
 Andre : Are you kidding me? 
 It's a terrible move. 
 It-it'll weaken the stock price and cost share holders millions. 
 Thank you for that, Andre. Thank you for the support. 
 It's not about you, it's about Empire. 
 No, Empire is Jamal, and Jamal is Empire, as are you. 
 Andre : What am I? 
 Empire or Jamal? 
 Or is Empire now the cult of Jamal? 
 We're launching an IPO, right? 
 This is not the time to take a bold stand in a matter that alienates so many of our customers. 
 No offense, Empire. 
 Yeah. You all good, baby. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 A'ight. 
 I got that. 
 I need to talk to my son. 
 Nah, it's cool, man. 
 It's cool. 
 All right, then. 
 (chuckles) 
 I don't like what Lucious did to you. 
 You saying Jamal don't deserve it? 
 No, that's not what I'm saying. 
 I'm saying you do, too. 
 I think Lucious should have gave it to both of y'all. 
 You still with Anika? 
 I was never with Anika. 
 I mean "with" on Creedmoor. 
 I want Empire. 
 Let's build our own, you and me. 
 I did it before. 
 You know I'm good, Hakeem. 
 And I know how good you are. 
 Much better than your father realizes. 
 Much better than you even realize. 
 We can do this; come on. 
 Look, Mom, we don't got to start from scratch no more. 
 What you talking about, boy? 
 What is this? 
 You leaving me? 
 Uh, well, you've already left me. 
 Listen, you got the wrong idea. 
 I never cheated on you with Michelle. 
 You may have not screwed her, but you shared something very intimate. 
 (scoffs) 
 Would it make a difference if I told you that she's as messed up as the rest of us? 
 I mean, Lucious offered her a contract, and she left the church. 
 Oh, wow, I'm so sorry for you, babe. 
 You know, I don't know what's worse... 
 That you left me for a phony, or that you conceded Empire to Jamal without even putting up a fight. 
 I'm going to Gina's. 
 She said I could stay in her guest room. 
 (sighs heavily) 
 Hakeem. 
 Yeah, it's me. 
 I changed my mind. 
 Tell me why I shouldn't throw this drink in your bitch-ass face? 
 You sure this was a good idea? 
 Are you sure you want this company? 
 'Cause you'd never get up off the floor, bitch. 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, she was talking trash. 
 What do you expect? 
 I'm no punk. 
 Go back to jail, bitch! 
 Hakeem : Mom, stop. Anika, chill out. 
 You been harassing me from the moment you arrived! 
 (grunting, blows thudding) 
 Let it go! You two deserve each other! 
 Mom, whoa, whoa, whoa! Chill, chill, chill. 
 Come on! Hey, chill, chill. 
 Anika : Who's Boo Boo Kitty now, bitch? 
 Andre : Mom, come on... 
 Don't touch, me, Keem. 
 All right, okay, okay. 
 -You okay? 
 Run them pearls, ho! 
 Bring it! 
 I'll bust it! 
 Off of me! 
 Bitch! Oh, you bitch! ...your throat! 
 Andre : Let her go, come on, Mom... Mom! 
 ...pearls off, right off your neck! 
 Andre : Let her go, Mom, Mom... 
 Get off me, bitch! 
 Come on... Mom, calm down. Mom! 
 Mom! Mom! Whoa. 
 Cookie : All right. 
 Anika : I'll be okay. Mom... 
 Hey, look, Mom, we here out of hate for the same man, right? 
 Right? 
 And, Mom, if we're gonna make a play for Empire, we need her. 
 Why do we need her? 
 Because Anika's got the relationship with Tony Trichter, that's why. 
 
 
 
 Who the hell is that? 
 It's a famous corporate raider. 
 We need somebody on his level if we're gonna be serious about this, Mom. 
 Anika : They call him "Tricky Trichter" 'cause he's the best at hostile takeovers. 
 He was gonna buy into Creedmoor 'cause his grandson is a rapper, so it's not gonna be hard to convince him to buy into Empire, instead. 
 Look, we got to stick together if we gonna do this. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I will work with Boo Boo Kitty this time. 
 Thank you.

 Uh... boy, you got it. 
 (laughs) You, you got somethin'. 
 You're not just giving me a load of crap because you want my money now, are you? 
 Oh, yeah, we giving you a load of crap. 
 But if we can sell Kid Fo-Fo, we can certainly sell this punk-ass grandson of yours. 
 (laughs) 
 You know, I've launched 23 hostile takeovers, and only six have failed. 
 Scotch? 
 Oh, yes, neat. Thank you. 
 It's not easy, but it can be done. 
 So, once the stock goes public, the first thing we do is buy controlling interest in the company. 
 Exactly, and that can be as much as 500 million. 
 Now, I'm in it for 150 if you release my grandson's album. 
 400. He ain't no Tupac. 
 200. 
 300. 
 250 is as much as my board will approve. 
 Andre : Getting the other 250's doable, but then we still have to topple the CEO. 
 If you can successfully replace him with a shill, then you can replace your board of directors, and the company is yours. 
 But the most effective way to replace a CEO is to replace a board of directors. 
 (chuckles) And you can't do that with your current CEO. 
 Tricky, isn't it? 
 Ah-ha! That's why they call you Tricky Trichter. 
 Child, I don't want no chicken. 
 I think some of my most effective takeovers have been when I can nail a CEO with a good scandal. 
 Prostitutes, drugs... You name it. 
 So, Lucious would have to be caught in a scandal? 
 And your raise your other 250 million, you got yourself your Empire. 
 I just want to know... if I tore my family apart again... for no reason. 
 Come on, girl, why you gonna ask me this? 
 Did Lucious kill Bunkie? 
 You know, it's crazy... the things that... can make a man go back to using. 
 Why? 
 Bunkie was trying to... shake him down for $3 million. 
 Threatening to pull down the IPO. 
 (gasps, sighs) 
 What happened to us, Cookie? 
 We was family. 
 We had each other's back. I... 
 I raised your boys. 
 Bunkie was my brother. 
 Lucious... 
 Lucious was my hero. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 It's a damn shame. 
 Jamal is my everything. 
 I can't lose him. 
 You're not gonna lose him, Cookie. 
 Just go talk to him, make it right. 
 (doorbell chimes) 
 You came to kiss Jamal's ass, you got to go to his place for that. 
 I'm here to talk to you. 
 You know, you're like a son to me, come on.

 I know, baby. That's all I ever wanted, too. 
 Look, Jamal... 
 I just want you to always remember what I told you, all those years ago, in that visiting room. 
 I got you. 
 Okay? 
 No matter what's going on between me and your daddy, I got you. 
 I know you do. 
 But, Ma, I need to know. 
 That's between him and the Lord, baby. 
 Vernon :  Look, Dre. 
 Your father's ringing the bell to take the company public tomorrow. 
 You're gonna run the business as you always have, right? 
 And Lucious will teach Jamal the rest of it, and... it's everything we ever wanted. 
 Are you listening to yourself? 
 What are you, a coward now? 
 Empire should be mine and you know it. 
 Dre, Dre, Dre, Dre... 
 You stabbed me in the back! 
 Dre what? - Don't ever say I stabbed you in the back. 
 I'm here, now, for you. 
 We still have this. You're still my family, Dre. 
 Dre? 
 Don't play that card with me! 
 You're not my family. 
 You're upset. 
 You're just my dad's thug. 
 Now, don't-don't do that. 
 And now, you're Jamal's thug. 
 I raised you, boy. 
 That's all you ever gonna be. 
 You ain't supposed to talk to me like that! 
 What's wrong with you? 
 You respect me! 
 Now, I didn't come here to fight. 
 Now, get up, so we can talk. 
 Now, you get the hell out of my house. 
 Dre, Dre...

 I'm good. I'm okay, I'm okay. 
 Let me see you. 
 I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Look at me. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, my God, baby. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You came back. 
 I want to fix this. 
 I do. 
 Me, too... 
 Me, too. 
 Baby, what the hell happened here? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 All right. 
 Uncle Vern? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Vern? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Uncle Vern, come on... 
 He doesn't have a pulse. 
 We gotta call the police. We gotta call the police. 
 No, no! Dre! Dre! Do not do that! Do not do that! 
 Why not? 
 Because there's gonna be a-an investigation and a trial and who knows what can happen? 
 I can't take that. No, it was self-defense! You was defending me! 
 Yeah, but you don't know they're gonna see it that way, baby! - No. They're gonna see it that. 
 Anything can happen! - Way because that's what we're gonna tell them. 
 Dre, Dre, no! Dre, I'm pregnant! 
 I'm calling! 
 Babe, I'm pregnant! 
 What? 
 Well, it's almost show time. 
 We've just got to wait for one person... Vernon. 
 He's almost here. He helped me start the company. 
 The New York Stock Exchange doesn't wait for anybody. 
 Yeah, maybe he fell off the wagon again, Dad. 
 (laughs) That's funny. 
 (laughs): Yeah. 
 As soon as you press that green button, Empire will be a publically traded company. 
 Do it, Dad. 
 Yeah, Dad. 
 Push it. 
 (chuckles)

 You ready? 
 Dwight Walker. 
 Who's that? 
 (sighs) That's my real name. 
 Cookie don't even know that. 
 I knew when I became an orphan at nine that, uh, Dwight wouldn't survive a week in those streets. 
 (sighs) So I created Lucious. 
 Lucious Lyon, the immortal. 
 The one who could not be killed. 
 I love you, son. 
 I always did. 
 I know I did some really... terrible things to you. 
 (sighs) 
 I was just scared and... it's hard enough growing up in this world as a black man. 
 But then to be... 
 ...homosexual on top of that, that was just... 
 Dad, Dad, stop. 
 Stop. 
 I understand. 
 You know, I'm proud of you, too. 
 For what? 
 (sighs) B-Being able to change your mind. 
 (chuckles) Come on, that's you. 
 (knocking on door) 
 You... Who is it? 
 Lucious Lyon, you're under arrest for the murder of Marcus "Bunkie" Williams. 
 This a joke? 
 No. No, this has to be a mistake. What the hell is this? 
 You're a parole officer. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can. 
 Agent Carter : Parole officer. - And will be used against you in a court of law. 
 Oh, my God. That was a joke. 
 Present with you while you are being questioned... 
 You did this to me? 
 No, I swear, Lucious. 
 No, I didn't. 
 You're a ghetto rat. 
 You'll always be a ghetto rat. 
 A ghetto rat?! 
 I did 17 years for you, Lucious! 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
 Hey, go, do my song. 
 Do our song. Kill it! 
 (crowd chanting) 
 We want Lucious! We want Lucious! We want Lucious! 
 I thought it was between him and the Lord. 
 We want Lucious! We want Lucious! We want Lucious! We want Lucious! We want Lucious! 
 (chanting): We want Lucious! We want Lucious... 
 (crowd cheering) 
 I am the son of Lucious Lyon.
