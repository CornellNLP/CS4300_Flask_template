 Previously on "Pretty Little Liars - The Perfectionists"   
 (Mona) Somebody left me a box of cupcakes last night.   
 They used Nolan's ID card to access my apartment.   
 - How would you know that? 
- I stole Taylor's RV.   
 I wanted you to know what I was using it for so you know you could trust me.   
 When people wanna know who you are if you're honest there are no wrong answers.   
 (Ava) I convinced myself that I came here with a clean slate.   
 (female # ) I think you moved on   
 you just never said it out loud.   
 I'm not the one who paired us..    
 - Forced. 
- Together.    
 Since Nolan's death I've been distracted.    
 There must be something you'd do to relax.    
 - Music is the art of math. 
- Well said, Amadeus.    
 If Professor James finds out that I can't play it could jeopardize my scholarship    
 It's a problem that I'm trying to fix.   
 I told you I don't wanna be a part of your shortcut.    
 I worked on this all night.    
 You didn't have to include my name on it, though.    
 Well, I wouldn't have solved the puzzle without you.    
 - Chess is the art of math. 
- Wait..    
 - You're Bad Bishop. 
- You're  Moves.    
 I did something really bad that could get me kicked out of the school and Dana knows it.    
 You were right about Dana Booker.    
 She left me those cupcakes.    
 She's playing your game.    
 Then I'll win.    
 Let's take this bitch down.    
 (Mona) So now that we know Dana is our A  we have to find out as much about her as possible.    
 You wanna profile her.    
 I did a report on criminal psychology last year and in order to catch a psychopath you wanna identify their personality behavioral traits so you can know what kind of psychopath you're dealing with.    
 Thank you, Spencer.    
 - I'm Caitlin. 
- Yeah, I know.    
 And we caught a break because it's Staff and Faculty Appreciation Day.    
 Yeah, which is all about celebrating and getting to know your fellow staff members.    
 (Caitlin) And you plan to get to know Dana.    
 Now, Dana has full access to Beacon Guard so keep all confidential conversations out of public restrooms.    
 They're spying on us in the bathrooms?    
 How do you know that?    
 When you spend enough time watching people you know when you're being watched.    
 When they realized I figured it out they brought me in and told me to keep my mouth shut.    
 Until now, that's what I did.    
 The cameras are there to protect us but let's not give Dana anything to use against us.    
 She already has something on me.    
 I might've screwed up.    
 - You definitely screwed up. 
- Definitely.    
 I submitted the cello piece as my own to Professor James and I think Dana knows about it.    
 - Oh, she knows about it. 
- Definitely.    
 Why did you cheat?    
 That can't keep being the answer for you, Dylan.    
 I know it was stupid, alright? 
But I felt backed into a corner.    
 You just handed Dana another huge chunk of leverage.    
 I know, but I-I physically could not play. Okay?    
 We have a plan.    
 I'm gonna use Caitlin's new friend Jeremy's computer 'cause it won't be traceable back to BHU.    
 So, I'll hack into the portal and I'll delete the file before Professor James can see it.    
 You can do that?    
 - Yeah, of course. 
- Nice.    
 Alright, well, you take care of that and I will find out as much about Dana as humanly possible.    
 It's not all bad news.    
 We have another player on our side.    
 Taylor.    
 So, now you think we can trust her?    
 I grew up with Taylor.    
 She loved her brother more than anything.    
 And she's back because she wants to find out who killed Nolan.    
 We all do.    
 You know the drill.    
 Act normal, bitches until we get what we need to bring Dana down.    
 ♪ If I show you then I know you ♪    
 ♪ Won't tell what I said ♪    
 ♪ 'Cause two can keep a secret ♪    
 ♪ If one of them is dead ♪♪    
 Are you done yet?    
 You know, asking me if I'm done every    seconds is actually slowing me down.     
 Slowing you down, as in, like, it's not going to work?     
 Or it will eventually work?     
 - Or what's... 
- Make him stop.     
 So, Dylan, if Ava deletes your upload you're still getting an incomplete.     
 - "If?" 
- When.     
 I will take an incomplete, I don't care about an incomplete, I'll double up on a class next semester.     
 This is better than being expelled.     
 Hey, how well do you know your new friend Jeremy?     
 Uh, why?     
 Well, I can access his browser to remove the upload but some of the files on this hard drive are, like, mega-encrypted.     
 Super lock-down.     
 It's pretty unusual for a personal computer.     
 Maybe he was doing some Hotchkiss work at home.     
 Well, if that was the case he'd be required to use Hotchkiss' encryption.     
 But this is like some next level military grade security.     
 Do you know how to use it?     
 Enough to help you.     
 Because your file has officially been..     
 Un-uploaded.     
 Thank you so much.     
 I'd really love to know what your friend does at Hotchkiss.     
 Yeah, me too.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 (man on speaker) Welcome to Faculty Appreciation Day.     
 Have fun getting to know your colleagues.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 Hi.     
 Did you miss me?     
 It has been quiet.     
 So welcome to my unofficial I'm not dead party.     
 I've been in your shoes.     
 It's best to get all the stares over with all at once.     
 How's it been with your mom?     
 She's been trying really hard.     
 She wants to take care of me almost to a fault.     
 Claire won't leave my side.     
 That's why I haven't been able to help you.     
 Have you been able to find out anything else about the investigation? 
About Dana Booker?     
 My mother thinks I'm far too fragile to talk about Nolan or Dana.     
 Dana is playing a dangerous game that we all know too well.     
 But Mona has a plan.     
 She's gonna use this afternoon's speed round game to get inside Dana's head.     
 Speed round?     
 It's a Q and A  for faculty and staff.     
 Like, speed dating.     
 Mona's crafted a series of questions that are designed to get a baseline psych profile on Dana.     
 It'll start easy and get more personal.     
 You know, like the FBI does.     
 I get it, you cannot defeat your enemies until...     
 Until you know who they are. Anthony Horowitz.     
 I'm Mona. I stole your RV.     
 Allie told me.     
 I wasn't expecting you to be so, so short.     
 You guys are gonna play nice, right?     
 Because we're on the same team now.     
 Nice to meet you.     
 (male # ) Ms. DiLaurentis?     
 I'll be back.     
 You may be in the circle but you'll never be in the circle.

 - Hi. 
- Hey.     
 Who killed your kitten?     
 I don't have a cat.     
 I found out a pairing got a     percent on the puzzle project.     
 They set the curve so high, the entire class is furious.     
 It was probably the twins.     
 I swear, they used mind tricks to finish each other's sentences.     
 It's really unfair they were even paired together to begin with.     
 Ava.     
 - It was us. 
- Us?     
 - As in you and me us? 
- We did it.   
 And I hear the twins are totally at each other's throats about it.     
 Oh, my God.     
 [chuckles]     
 Zava for the win.     
 - Zava? 
- Yeah.     
 Like, hashtag Zava.     
 Like, when Brangelina was a thing. Oh, my God!     
 I can't even tell you how much that break up shook me.     
 I was so not prepared for that.     
 [instrumental music]     
 Huh. I would not have pegged you as a cat person.     
 Don't tell me you hate cats.     
 If you hate cats, this is gonna be a problem.     
 And we're gonna have to start this thing all over again.     
 I don't wanna start back at square one with you.     
 So, I'm just gonna lie and say that I like cats.     
 But how do you really feel?     
 I like cats.     
 [laughs]     
 Nice laugh, Jalali.     
 You know, when they warned me you'd be the only person here over winter break, they were not kidding.     
 Thank you for staying with me.     
 I know you gave up a weekend in the Alps.     
 Ava, I didn't give anything up.     
 I'm exactly where I wanna be.     
 I am too.     
 Well... I know you wanted a white Christmas.     
 I'm sorry I couldn't make that happen for you.     
 It's okay.     
 I'm not really celebrating this year, remember?     
 I'm not sure if I can return the partridges in a pear tree or the two turtle dogs.     
 Uh, wait.     
 Did you just say, "Two turtle dogs?"     
 Yeah. Why?     
 [laughing]     
 Wow.     
 What?     
 I love your laugh, Jalali.     
 [instrumental music]     
 (Zach) Ava.   
 Ava.     
 We should head to class, yeah?     
 Hashtag Zava.     
 Actually there's something that I forgot that I should, I should probably do, so, um  you can just go ahead and I'll-I'll just catch up.     
 Oh, okay.     
 I'll see you there then, yeah?     
 [cello music]     
 Mr. Walker? So glad you stopped by.     
 - You are? 
- Your submission..     
 [scatting]     
 (Dylan) You got my submission.     
 I can't stop listening to it.     
 I'm submitting you to the Davis Concerto competition.     
 The winner's work always goes viral.     
 By this time next year, you could be world famous.     
 Uh, I-I don't know what to say.     
 Don't say anything.     
 Just keep playing.

 You seem busier than usual.     
 Uh, how's the rocket scientist business?     
 [chuckles] You know what I do is boring.     
 I educate employees on how to use proprietary software.     
 Not sending people to Mars.     
 Must be a lot of secrets on that thing.     
 No, not at all. That's my personal computer.     
 - Don't really use it. 
- So why do you need it?     
 Cait. What's going on?     
 Why the sudden interest in my job and my laptop?     
 No reason.     
 [phone ringing]     
 Just gonna take this outside.     
 Professor Zangulary? Is-is that right?     
 Zan-Zangulary?     
 You're from Pennsylvania? I'm from Rosewood.     
 That's so funny.     
 Professor Wagner, psychology.     
 Yeah, no, it's pronounced Vanderwaal.     
 Yeah. The second A is silent.     
 Oh, wow, I didn't know that pocket squares were so intricate.

 Hola. Alison DiLaurentis.   
 Gabriel Evaristo.     
 Professor of language studies.     
 On loan from the University of Buenos Aires.     
 Um..     
 I'm learning Spanish on an app.     
 How did I do?     
 I think you need to try another app.     
 What did I say?     
 What do you think you said?     
 I know an Argentine baker who bakes without preservatives.     
 Ah, I get it now.     
 [laughs] I don't think I wanna know what I said.     
 [bell dings]     
 I think you need a tutor not an app.     
 Maybe I do.     
 [instrumental music]     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 Why are you playing?     
 I'm here, and I'm a Hotchkiss.     
 - Here, take my phone. 
- I have a phone.     
 It's loaded with a built-in voice stress analyzer.     
 Dana's not gonna lie to me.     
 I'm asking her simple non-threatening questions today.     
 I get it, but if we can prove when she's telling the truth then we can also prove when she's lying. Down the line.     
 Because sometimes the truth is more telling than a lie.     
 A truth detector?     
 Who's in the circle now?     
 [bell dings]     
 [instrumental music]     
 The games begin.     
 - What's your favorite color? 
- Blue.     
 Why did you bring Alison to Beacon Heights?     
 I didn't. Mrs. Hotchkiss did.     
 If you could meet one historical figure who would it be?     
 Why do you care?     
 You can't answer a question with a question.     
 Didn't you hear the rules?     
 Amelia Earhart, after she went missing.     
 - Of course. 
- Where's your safe place?     
 If I told you it wouldn't be safe anymore.     
 Why'd you go into law enforcement?     
 My younger sister was bullied in high school she killed herself bullies got away with it.     
 Bullies.     
 Isn't it funny how sometimes we become the thing that we hate?     
 [bell dings]     
 Did we get what we need?     
 It's a start.     
 Hey.     
 You never showed up to class. What happened?     
 You okay?     
 Earlier you seemed happy. What changed?     
 Well, you reminded me of someone I lost.     
 Drink?     
 Why do have Nolan's shirt?     
 Because I didn't have anything else to wear the first time I stayed over.     
 Oh.     
 I thought he and Caitlin were a thing.     
 It's complicated.     
 Even more than I thought.     
 You wanna talk about it?     
 I can't.

 (Dana) Nice view.     
 I let myself in. I hope you don't mind.     
 Kidding. I actually don't care if you mind.     
 - What do you want? 
- I know about your injury.     
 And that you can't play right now but congrats on your original recording.     
 Being submitted to the Davis Concerto competition.     
 - How did you, uh... 
- Campus doctor.     
 Beacon Guard, full access, remember?     
 You're drowning.     
 And I'm here to offer you a lifeline.     
 Why should I trust you?     
 'Cause you don't have a choice.     
 I just need you to do one thing and this all goes away.     
 Tell me where Alison, Ava and Caitlin were the night Nolan was killed.     
 And why don't you think it was me anymore?     
 'Cause I've been watching you.     
 You could never stand up to Nolan.     
 You don't fight back.     
 You haven't got it in you.     
 So when you say that this all goes away.     
 I wipe the slate clean.     
 I'll take care of Professor James.     
 He'll never know that wasn't your recording.     
 You won't be expelled.     
 And because you're the one I actually like     
 I'll throw in an iron clad alibi.     
 And I'll make sure your friends never know it was you who ratted them out.     
 Think it over.     
 [instrumental music]     
 - Here you go. Yeah. 
- Thank you.     
 [phone beeps]     
 - Dylan? 
- No.     
 He still hasn't responded to my texts.     
 Why did you wanna see us?     
 I sobered up for you.     
 Why were you drinking again?     
 You first.     
 My new friend Jeremy.     
 He's not my new friend.     
 We've been seeing each other for almost a year.     
 - You and the British guy? 
- Yeah.     
 We started dating when you and Nolan started seeing each other.     
 A year?     
 How did you swing that?     
 We've had a lot of car dates.     
 But you couldn't breakup with Nolan because he was blackmailing you.     
 One of my moms is having an affair and Nolan had pictures.     
 Wow.     
 Well, I'm sorry I looked the other way.     
 I didn't know Nolan was such a jerk to you.     
 You probably wonder why I loved him.     
 There was a time when Nolan actually cared about me.     
 I know what that side of him looks like.     
 He made me forget that I was alone.     
 You got the best of him.     
 Your turn.     
 This guy made me laugh today.     
 Like Nolan used to make me laugh.     
 And that's bad?     
 It just kinda snuck up on me.     
 And it felt awful.     
 - Like I was betraying Nolan. 
- Okay, so you like this guy.     
 I don't know. Maybe.     
 Nolan would want you to be happy.     
 - You have to know that. 
- Thank you.     
 You know, I really am enjoying this warm and fuzzy truth talk.     
 But why tell me about Jeremy now?     
 Because I need somebody to talk to.     
 And you were so right about Jeremy's computer.     
 He says he hardly uses it.     
 So why lock it up like Fort Knox?     
 Did you ask him?     
 He would not give me a straight answer which is so not like Jeremy.     
 He's keeping something from me.     
 - Like what? 
- I don't know.     
 But I need to find out.     
 [phone beeps]     
 - Dylan? 
- Yeah.     
 He says to meet at the quad.     
 I know it's fast, but don't worry.     
 I got enough this morning to pull this off.     
 Remember, we have to act normal-ish.     
 [bell tolling]     
 Hi.     
 Hey.     
 So we're doing this? 
For real? In person?     
 For real. Game on.     
 Gracias.   
 How did you land such a nice place?     
 My apartment looks like a dorm.     
 I'm sure it's not that bad.     
 Trust me, it is.     
 So how is it being a TA while you're getting your masters?     
 It's a lot.     
 You know, especially at BHU.     
 I understand.     
 I worked all the way through college too.     
 What'd you do?     
 If I tell you, you'll laugh.     
 I mean, I've already offended you in Spanish so go for it.     
 I taught ball room dancing.     
 See, I told you.     
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh.     
 I just didn't expect that.     
 My ex-wife and I took some ball room classes, but... it's more scary than fun 'cause our teacher was so mean.     
 That's terrible.     
 Dancing should be fun.     
 What're you doing?     
 Giving you a free lesson.     
 Oh, no, that's okay. It's been a while.     
 I'm a really good teacher.     
 [instrumental music]     
 [music continues]     
 [music continues]     
 See? Fun.     
 [alarm ringing]     
 My alarm.     
 [sighs]     
 I have to get ready for the mixer.     
 We can be late. Or ditch it.     
 I'm a TA. It's mandatory.     
 - I'll see you there? 
- Yeah.     
 Gabriel.     
 Thank you for the dance.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 [instrumental music]     
 Alright then.     
 What?     
 Nothing. It's a good move.     
 [instrumental music]     
 We can't do this.     
 We're just playing chess.     
 No, we're not.     
 - Hey, Dylan. 
- Do not "Hey, Dylan" me.     
 
 
 
 (Dylan) I thought we were friends.     
 Look, I asked you a million times if it would work and you promised that it would.     
 - You said that you got... 
- I deleted it.     
 Well, then, how did my professor hear it?     
 (Ava) It must've been Dana, she found a way to send it to him.     
 How're you blaming me for this?     
 You're the one who made the mistake.     
 Dylan, come on, this is so not fair.     
 (Dylan) I'm about to get kicked out of here.     
 - Is that fair? 
- I'm sorry.     
 What am I supposed to do about it?     
 I don't know what this is about but this isn't the time or the place.     
 [dramatic music]     
 Celebrating our faculty and staff here at BHU is an annual tradition.     
 But recent events have forced me to take a hard look at our mission statement.     
 We've always strived for perfection here at BHU and I'm responsible for that.     
 But with responsibility comes repercussions.     
 In light of understanding how our culture here at BHU breeds competition and pressure I've decided it's time for a change.     
 Success at BHU will no longer be strictly about academic performance.     
 We will move forward with a more balanced approach and curriculum.     
 Thank you.     
 [applauding]     
 Did you know about this? It's kind of huge.     
 First time I'm hearing the Claire  . .     
 You okay?     
 What does okay even mean anymore?     
 Hi, we haven't met.     
 I'm Gabriel. And welcome home.     
 - Thank you. 
- Shall we get some drinks?     
 I'm good.     
 Have you tried the mojitos?     
 It's my mother's recipe.     
 How can you say no to that?     
 Shall we?     
 [instrumental music]     
 Oh, hey. I didn't know you'd be here.     
 Have you been messing with my computer?     
 Uh, no.     
 Where are you going? It's late.     
 - Work. 
- Do you want me to drive you?     
 We could stop for dinner on the way.     
 No, I've really gotta go.     
 Cait, I love you.     
 I love you too.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 What you lookin' at?     
 Am I gonna have to put a bell around your neck?     
 That's almost funny.     
 Thank you for your phone but I'm gonna need to keep it for a while.     
 Fine, but hurry up.     
 Dana is a distraction.     
 I need to find out who killed my brother.     
 (Claire) Well, I have to be honest.     
 My daughter Taylor inspired all the soul searching.     
 Taylor's struggles really forced me to re-examine our philosophy here at BHU.     
 As one of the most respected universities in the country it is my hope that BHU will become a leader in a broader movement of change.     
 And that our students will be much more balanced and safer because of it. Thank you.     
 I know what you're going to say.     
 That I'm using your situation to promote the school.     
 But I really do want this place to change.     
 Because of you and for you.     
 I believe you.     
 But this is typical, mom.     
 I snap and you end up smelling like a rose just like last time.     
 [instrumental music]     
 [music continues]     
 [music continues]     
 You made the right decision.     
 Let's just get this over with.     
 This is in front of your dorm     
 Time stamped at the exact moment     
 Nolan was thrown from Thorne Hall.     
 That proves you weren't there when it happened.     
 I wasn't at my dorm. I was at...     
 Shh, shh, shh..     
 It's real if I say it's real.     
 Now, tell me the truth about where your friends were the night Nolan was killed and this becomes your truth.     
 Just like that?     
 You'd do that, you'd manufacture evidence for me?     
 If it gets me what I need.     
 And they'd never find out that I was the one who told?     
 No. After what I saw today, I'm surprised you care.     
 I want this to be over.     
 This is a really hard thing for me to do.     
 Take some time. Pull yourself together.     
 Then come by my office.     
 (Dylan) She's gone.     
 Did we get it?     
 (Dylan on recorder) Just like that, you'd do that you'd manufacture evidence for me?     
 (Dana on recorder) If it gets me what I need.     
 We got everything. 
The fake fight worked.     
 Once I match this recording to the baseline I got this morning we'll have proof that Dana was telling the truth.     
 That she was willing to commit a felony to frame you guys.     
 She can't lie her way out of it this time.     
 This is almost over.     
 Bitch is goin' down.

 I'm sorry for all the calls and messages.     
 I'm not usually this attached to my phone.     
 I understand what it's like to be attached to your students.     
 It drives my wife crazy and she's always calling me out...     
 Whoa! Back up!     
 You're married?     
 I thought you knew.     
 How would I have known?     
 You're not even wearing a wedding ring.     
 I teach an elective in romance languages and modern relationships.     
 I'm honest in the class about why an open relationship works for my wife and me.     
 I haven't taken your class.     
 And I'm really trying to avoid drama in my life right now.     
 It's more dynamic than dramatic, but I get it.     
 Our lifestyle isn't for everyone, and I never push.     
 And I'm, I'm not judging.     
 I didn't think you were.     
 I hope we can still be friends?     
 I don't know a lot of adults in Beacon Heights so... I'd like that.     
 I'll treat you to a coffee for another Spanish lesson.     
 It's a date.     
 I mean, not a date, but a date.

 [cell phone buzzing]     
 - Hey. 
- It worked.     
 Dylan actually got Dana to bait him with the fake alibi.     
 You know, when you say actually it makes it sound like you didn't think that I could pull it off.     
 It worked, Cait. We got her.     
 Now we can prove to Claire that Dana's corrupt.     
 [dramatic music]     
 Cait! Hello.     
 Uh, hey, I gotta call you back, okay.     
 I'll be.. Sorry.     
 That's weird.     
 She said, she's calling us back.     
 I guess it's time to start packin' up. Huh?     
 Dylan, I'm sorry.     
 I got so excited about bringing Dana down     
 I forgot what this actually means for you.     
 Who do you think I should tell first?     
 Andrew or... Professor James.     
 When the school finds out what Dana was doing to us the pressure she's been putting on us..     
 Maybe the ethics committee will give you a second chance.     
 Maybe they won't expel you.     
 We did delete the email.     
 It was Dana who sent the recording to James.     
 You know what really surprises me..     
 If I do get kicked out..     
 I think I can live with it.     
 After how hard you worked to get here?     
 We've spent this whole semester running on a hamster wheel.     
 I've made the same mistakes over and over.     
 I cheated to get ahead. That's not..     
 - That's not who I am. 
- Well, you made a mistake.     
 But you belong at BHU.     
 [cello music]     
 (Ava) And she's actually kinda right.     
 Okay, let's get back to work. Let's finish up.     
 No, I-I meant about the fun part.     
 I know. I kinda like hanging out with you guys.     
 [music continues]     
 Well, it brought us together.     
 - For Caitlin. 
- For Caitlin.   
 (Ava) So I guess that's our silver lining.   
 (Dylan) Are we... together?   
 Don't give up.     
 Don't get me wrong, I'm gonna fight like hell to stay here.     
 No matter how it turns out, I'll be okay.     
 I'll be happy for you and for Caitlin.

 (Dylan) Nothing makes me happier than to see you happy.   
 I'm using this morning's baseline recording of her truths to match against her offer to Dylan.     
 That way when we take it to Claire     
 Dana will not be able to argue that she was bullshitting.     
 (Mona on phone) She had every intention of giving Dylan a fake alibi.     
 Then we can prove that Dana was willing to break the law to get what she wants.     
 I don't think Claire  .  will want that from her head of security.     
 [messenger beeps]

 Uh, yeah, I'll, um..     
 I'll let you know when we have the analysis confirmation.

 I'm surprised your mom let you out alone.     
 Oh, I'm not alone. There are two guards on your front porch.     
 I know I should've called first.     
 But I didn't wanna talk about this over the phone.     
 What is it?     
 I want to be the person to give my mom the evidence about Dana.     
 I need it to come from me so she understands how valuable I am.     
 It's the only way she'll give me full access to Beacon Guard and everything she knows about who killed Nolan.     
 Mona still doesn't trust you.     
 But you do.     
 [dramatic music]     
 You shouldn't have followed me.     
 Why?     
 Jeremy, what's going on?     
 Get in the car.
