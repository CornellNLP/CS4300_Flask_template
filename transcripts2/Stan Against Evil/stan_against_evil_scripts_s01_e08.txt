 Wow. 
 Sorry, it's, uh... Just when I thought things couldn't get any weirder, you know... 
 The eyes of the grave have seen his death. 
 And when they look into the soul, then he will meet his true end, and the time will close once and for all. 
 And... and my friend... He'll be okay? 
 To save him, you're gonna have to go back to the beginning. 
 How?
