 Stanley. 
 Sheriff Miller. 
 "Hope will not leave us disappointed. 
 Because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. 
 At the appointed time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for us godless men. 
 It is rare that anyone should lay down his life for a just man, though it is barely possible that, for a good man, someone may have the courage to die."

 You want to start some sh1t with me? 
 Stanley, please! 
 Eh, clamp.

 You ask them a question, and then they answer your question  with  a question. 
 But do they ever  answer  your question? 
 No, no, no, no, no.

 I-I just assumed your deputy would be the guy... 
 Leon? Yeah. 
 He's about as useful as tits on a flashlight. 
 His family owns the building, so if I can him, I got to move the whole department over to the fire station, and what a nest of shitheads that place is.

 What... What is this thing? 
 It's Mom's necklace book. 
 You know Mom's necklace with the glass thingy? 
 She used to put it on the page, and she'd read the words through the glass. 
 She did it all the time before she went out. 
 Before she went out? 
 Yeah. 
 She'd go out after you went to bed.

 Starsky and Hutch weren't gay.

 You're a cop. Read the signs, would you? 
 Stan, look at this. 
 No! 
 Not until you say Starsky and Hutch were gay. 
 Just come here, would you?

 Isn't this the woman from the funeral? 
 Yeah. 
 Her name was, uh... yeah, Stella Stanas.

 Supposedly, Claire's necklace helped you read all this baloney. 
 Oh! Where is it? 
 Oh, now, it's funny you'd mention that. 
 You want to take your best guess at just exactly what I was trying to get when  you  threatened to kill me? 
 Why didn't you say something? 
 Just to prove you don't have any idea what you're doing.

 And for the Daily Double, include, "Starsky and Hutch were gay." 
 Well... 
 Go ahead, give... give that a try.
