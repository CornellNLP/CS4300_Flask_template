 Hello, sir. What'll it be? 
 Tell this guy to leave. 
 Please... I want to look like this. 
 You look like an utter c**t. 
 What about Milan? 
 Still looking for him. 
 About this trip... 
 I haven't been to London for 10 years. 
 I already have... 
 I'm not happy we're going undermanned. 
 Don't worry, it'll be fine. 
 It's a new start. 
 You're scaring us, Khalil. 
 Don't worry. No reason to be scared. 
 You told us to take our things who knows where. 
 A boat? You're putting us on a boat? 
 Where are we going on it? 
 I told you not to come, not like this. 
 I wanted to. 
 Hello. 
 You don't want to see me, Mum... 
 But I wanted to be here too... to check you're safe. 
 Is this your fault? 
 Is it his fault? 
 Don't start, Samira. 
 Khalil, why are we here? We're entitled to know! 
 You've changed. 
 It's me, mom. 
 Is it? 
 I'm not so sure. 
 It looks like you. Either you've changed or I've forgotten who you were. 
 I don't know... 
 I'm sorry, Mom. 
 Why are we here? 
 Didn't you explain? 
 No. They would have freaked out. 
 They should. 
 What's going on? 
 I can't say. Do as you're told. 
 You're safe here. 
 You stay till we sort things out. 
 You just have to stay here for a few days. 
 Please don't go out. 
 Where are you going? Did you have to show up? 
 I can't talk here. Follow me. 
 Soon all this will be mine. 
 Soon all this will be flats. 
 And our airport will be much better. 
 What's this? 
 Our hit list. 
 To deal with people who want to kill you: kill them first You're joking. 
 Do I look like I am? 
 You came to me in a panic.. Now you have a list of 12 guys you want to kill? 
 I should turn a blind eye? Really? 
 All I'm trying to do is protect my family. 
 Let's wait a while. I'll arrest them, OK? 
 Arrest them? 
 Then what? 
 So they can kill us when they get out of custody? 
 We're still have ahead of them, but not for long. 
 Don't send in your men. 
 Let us take out those sons of bitches. 
 Get real, OK? 
 The family's safe. I'm OK. You lie low. 
 Let's see what they do, then I'll bust them. 
 You want to take them out! 
 The Minister gave me two jobs: make a lot of business contacts and make sure you're not arrested. 
 Is it your first time in London? 
 No. We did a robbery here in 2006. 
 Harry Winston, on Bond Street. 
 Two million in uncut diamonds. 
 We could do it again since we're here. 
 First time in England. 
 I did my PhD here. 
 The food is bland, people are bland, but very smart. 
 They once ruled the world. Beware of them. 
 Especially her. She's Spanish but wants to be English. 
 You introduced us. 
 I thought you'd get on well. 
 See you later. 
 
 
 
 Help! 
 Knife attack, Boulevard Chave. Attacker on the run. 
 Shots fired, Grand Littoral. Victim dead. 
 The attacker has fled the scene. 
 Five dead on Corniche Beach. 
 Any officers in the area identify yourselves. 
 Leave a message. 
 Cool place. 
 Who's that guy? 
 I go nowere alone anymore! 
 Who do you think you are? 
 What's your problem? 
 You screwed me! 
 What? 
 Stop! 
 Who are you? 
 Your brother. 
 Your savior, the one who is keeping you alive. 
 Shut up! I didn't need you! 
 I didn't need you! 
 I'm trying to keep us all alive. 
 Who told you to do that? 
 Who? 
 Who told you to do that? 
 I told you I'd do it. 
 Thanks for letting me do. 
 What will you do now? 
 Arrest me? 
 Out. 
 Get out. Go on, get out. 
 Someone's doing your job for you. 
 I'll find those who did this. 
 Now that Roman's gone, someone's trying to take control. 
 Very professional. It's impressive. 
 Impressive. 
 When rats eat other rats, no-one cares. 
 When they attack your children, it's different. 
 So, go ahead. Do your job. 
 But don't push too hard. 
 Roman understood one thing. 
 When they kill each other, it's not really our problem. 
 Maybe you're too young to understand that. 
 I'm going to f*ck you. 
 Who pushed him? 
 You or Zlatko? 
 I missed you most when I left. 
 I talked to myself pretending it was you. 
 I bet you had the last word. 
 I don't know... 
 You were my... 
 You were my kid brother. And now... 
 Let's get in the car. It's cold. 
 One king to rule them all. 
 We can trust each other. 
 Not like those bastards, Manu and Roman. 
 No, I can't do that. We can't do that. 
 Khalil... 
 No, listen... You'll... 
 I'll come up with a solution. 
 Yes? 
 Yes. 
 When I get back from London, we'll talk it all over. 
 Will you arrest Milan Celik? 
 Yeah. Huh? 
 You can't arrest Milan Celik. 
 Why not? Why can't I? 
 He can identify me. 
 He can identify you? What are you saying? 
 How come? 
 Huh? 
 Oh! 
 You sold them the guns for the robbery? 
 Mokhtar? 
 Touch me one more time and I swear you'll regret it, Khalil. 
 Always you play the big brother! 
 Things have changed. 
 Things have changed, Khalil. 
 You understand? You understand who I've become? 
 You understand? 
 I have a lot of power, Khalil. 
 Thanks to you! 
 So, from now on, you do as I say. 
 You made your decision when we went after Roman! 
 Accept it! Accept it, will you? 
 Yeah? 
 Who is it? 
 It's me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What? 
 You gonna arrest me? 
 Huh? 
 Did I put too much pressure on you? 
 I'll sort out your problem. 
 It's over, Khalil. We did it. 
 Together, you and me. 
 Khalil You can't do that. 
 I am your brother, Khalil. 
 You got me. I'll have to sh1t in a bag from now on. 
 Dirty son of... 
 Come back soon. 
 Yeah, I promise. 
 Take care of yourself, son. 
 You too. 
 Find the one who did this. 
 Of course I will.
