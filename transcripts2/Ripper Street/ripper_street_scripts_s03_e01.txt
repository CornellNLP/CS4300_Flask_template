 And you are? 
 I am Railways. 
 Who are you? 
 Me? 
 I'm Guns. 
 [Man chuckles] 
 My apologies if I am late. 
 But now the way it has been laid out for me in these here indications, it is you who now will tell us the wins and outs. 
 You have met him? 
 I have not, but... all these instructions. 
 He's a sly one, is he not? 
 Hiding hisself away from us all. 
 Well, come on, then. 
 Tell us how, this way to get rich. 
 The timetabling, the point systems... 
 I have computed it all. 
 And here. See? 
 This is how the Bishopsgate goods line may be intruded upon. 
 The one we pinch will be bigger. 
 [Laughs] 
 See? 
 Railways! 
 [Train passing] 
 [Train passing] 
 [Debris falling] 
 Good morning, Chief Inspector. 
 What is it brings you by? 
 Well, if you might be distracted from your beloved archive... 
 There is news I would share with you, Edmund. 
 Indeed? 
 Urgent, I imagine, given the hour. 
 First, however, there is a matter to which I must attend. 
 If you please, Constable Grace. 
 8 1/2 by 6 1/4, Inspector. 
 Other features? 
 Scarring, left mastoid to collarbone. 
 What is this? 
 Eh? 
 This ain't coppering. 
 You may well say. 
 Is it not, Mr. Cree? 
 What? 
 That's not... 
 Not the name you gave to my booking sergeant, no, but you are Herbert John Cree. 
 Three counts of receiving stolen goods, one of larceny, wanted on suspicion of two counts of burglary. 
 It is no wonder to me that you have so informed an opinion on our work. 
 And what is it you wish from me? 
 I wish you to enlighten me, Mr. Cree. 
 You wish me to snitch for you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 But on who? 
 On all and on everything. 
 Each villain, every paymaster, each and every whispered scheme or rumor, no matter how trifling they seem, I want them all. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 You? 
 How I'm now alone with my vices. 
 I'm taking my pension, Edmund. 
 Bournemouth or so Mrs. Abberline's thinking runs. 
 It is my recommendation that I should be replaced by you. 
 Who then to see my work here completed? 
 The archive, Chief Inspector. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Do you not see what it is I built here? 
 Be they pimp or pornographer, confidence man or blackmailer, thief, fence, cracksman, or pickpocket, soon there will be not a villain in Whitechapel or the east whose particulars, habits, or associates are not known to me. 
 To  me,  Fred. 
 And you would have me dozing in a deck chair in St. James' Park. 
 I would, my friend. 
 Dozing in the sunshine, blessed by a breeze. 
 Instead this... 
 The villains of this quarter, turn from blood and bone, into scratchings on paper. 
 In what hope, Inspector? 
 That such cyphers might one day carry you to the door of the Devil himself. 
 Fred Abberline lectures me on obsession as is a rum night. 
 No, I am yet your superior, and you will mind me. 
 Drake has gone, your yankee dismissed. 
 Yet here you are, still alone, but for your books. 
 I would see you go on from this place, Edmund, before it swallows you whole. 
 [Train whistle blowing] 
 [Whistling] 
 [Thud] 
 Now, there's only you to work this system. 
 I do hope you are as good as your word, Railways. 
 Railways? 
 This signaling system was first built in April '75. 
 Before then were points who's been hand-worked down on the tracks themselves. 
 Railways! 
 I care not. 
 Now, he stirs, he gets a clout, understand? 
 We go to set our trap. 
 Use that know-how of yours and send our engine to us. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 People have died to contact you. 
 It's Whitechapel. 
 They die every day. 
 Fifty-five lives, given up for £350,000. 
 People have died to contact you. 
 It's Whitechapel. 
 [Man snoring] 
 They die every day. 
 [Rumbling] 
 [American accent] Huh? Oh! sh1t! 
 [Breathes heavily] 
 Hale morning to you, darlin'. 
 Oh, god. He's American. 
 I never did make any pretense to the fact. 
 [Lighter clicks] 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm Hermione. 
 Morton. 
 It's Mimi, for short. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 Your father bought Blewett's two months back. 
 Ever since then, you attend evening performances on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. 
 Usually, you're unaccompanied, but occasionally, you bring an escort. 
 Dear me, Ivan. 
 His name you remember, I see. 
 Well, who are you? 
 [Scoffs] 
 If you will not say, I shall see for myself. 
 A doctor? 
 That man, the ripper... 
 There was a notion, was there not, that he was perhaps an American doctor? 
 It persists. 
 Shall I be very frightened? 
 "Captain Homer Jackson." 
 You were an army man once? 
 Once a lawman, also, but now only a sawbones. 
 So you be careful. That's sharp. 
 Is it, indeed? 
 Do you wield it with skill? 
 If harm came my way on these dark streets, would you bring me here and clean my wounds and make me whole again? 
 If you asked nicely. 
 I ask now. 
 Ask nicer. 
 And when you are done... with courtesy. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Ah. 
 The documents you asked for, Miss Hart. 
 My solicitor, Mr. Capshaw. 
 Counselor Cobden, it is a pleasure. 
 Our clinic. 
 We make something new here and should not anticipate such an undertaking to be met with universal approval. 
 There will be complaint... some of it certain to be legal. 
 [Sighs] 
 Your organization. 
 When I think on what Obsidian Estates once was... a bastion of inequity... and what it now is. 
 Something that was once so opaque, self-serving, primitive... it is now a beacon of civic participation and progress. 
 And it is all down to you, miss hart. 
 Counselor, you're too kind. 
 Too kind by a stretch. 
 It is but the soundest of business philosophies that we here embrace. 
 Indeed. 
 And would you share it? 
 There's no great sophistication. 
 It is simply this... what is best for the people of the east is also best for Obsidian. 
 Miss Hart. 
 Hmm? 
 Our first intakers selected. 
 The Obsidian clinic's first students and nurses. 
 I have met them all this week. 
 And each calls this quarter their home? 
 Of course... as you insisted. 
 Will you be here to greet them yourself? 
 It is thanks to your generosity, after all, that I employ them. 
 I will, Dr. Frayn, and all those that follow. 
 14 past 8:00. 
 The docks company engine crosses the cutting at St. John's. 
 Only this morning, it does not. 
 17 past 8:00. 
 Unscheduled diversion eastward. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 Man : What the hell's that?! 
 We're diverting! 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Grunts, groans] 
 [Laughs] 
 Railways. 
 If you weren't so ugly, I'd kiss ya. 
 [Ticking] 
 Man : That is some precise signaling. 
 Thieving the Bishopsgate run, are you? 
 And you've allowed for the Necropolis, yes? 
 You mean the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company? 
 That runs on the London and Blackwall... 
 South off of here. 
 But there is engineering on the line, as occurs, since Monday. 
 They travel the same tracks... 
 Gregory Enright. 
 Look! 
 Where'd that come from? 
 Good Christ! 
 Tell me... which one?! 
 What number?! 
 There's no time! There's no time! 
 [Whistle blows] 
 Which?! 
 Number 25. 
 [Shouting indistinctly] 
 [Shouts indistinctly] 
 [Laughs] Never doubted you, Railways. 
 Never doubted you. 
 [Steam hissing] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Gunshot] 
 Whoever made such a plan, they made it well. 
 Next stop... Farringdon, ladies and gentlemen! 
 Farringdon and all stations via Whitechapel terminus! 
 Man : Come along! 
 Arthur, get here. 
 Come on, I've got three bags! 
 Oh, wait, please! Come on! 
 Here, ma'am. I'll take one of those. 
 Oh, thank you, mister. 
 Yeah, you get on the train. 
 Come on, soldier. I'll take that. 
 There we go. 
 Blimey. 
 What you got in there? 
 Here we go. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you, mister. 
 Mr.? 
 Drake. 
 [Steam hisses] 
 [Whistle blows] 
 Arthur : Mr. Drake? 
 Where is it you travel today? 
 Arthur! 
 I do apologize, Mr. Drake. 
 No, please, ma'am. No apologies. 
 I travel through to Whitechapel, Arthur. 
 Oh, as we ourselves do. 
 Oh. 
 Do you know it well, sir? 
 Arthur! 
 Well, soldier... 
 I've not walked its streets for gone four years now. 
 But once... 
 Yes. 
 I knew it well. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Steam hissing] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 Whitechapel. 
 See? 
 That's Leman Street. 
 And we're on the passenger line. 
 [Train whistle blows] 
 [Whistle blowing] 
 [Brakes squealing] 
 [Crash] 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 [Woman screaming] 
 The people. 
 Help them! 
 Wire for more men. 
 [Women screaming] 
 [Baby crying] 
 Mother? 
 Mother? 
 [Screaming continues] 
 Man : There will be many dead, Gregory Enright. 
 You question how it is I know your name. 
 I do not. 
 [Rifle cocks] 
 No, please. 
 Please, you're not this man. You're not. 
 Gregory, no! 
 No, please, don't! 
 No, I beg you! 
 No! 
 [Gunshot] 
 No! 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Bell clanging] 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 Get the people off the street and into the station house, Grace. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Captain Jackson. 
 Jackson : Sergeant. 
 Reid. 
 I imagine a man in my calling might find some purpose here. 
 See he gets what he needs. 
 Three groupings, Sergeant. You follow me? 
 First, those who most like will live, regardless of what we may do for them. 
 Second, those whom our care may save, and, uh... 
 Third. 
 Those past saving. 
 [Woman screaming, wailing] 
 Drake : Mr. Reid! 
 Are you just gonna stand there? 
 Man : That's all right. You'll be fine. 
 All right, now. All right. 
 Go on, mate. How about yourself there? 
 Get yourself back there. 
 Here! 
 Here, here. 
 [Moaning] 
 I have you. 
 Mr. Reid? 
 To me, Mr. Reid. 
 [Crying] 
 There you are. 
 I got you. 
 You're all right. 
 You're okay. 
 Drake! Lay her here. 
 She's gonna be all right. 
 Long time, no see, Drake. 
 What is this... a hallucination? 
 Are we all, in fact, dead, and you're here to greet us? 
 Okay. 
 Squeeze my hand, darling. 
 You hear me? You hear me. 
 Okay. You're gonna be okay. You. 
 [Breathing raggedly] 
 What? 
 Give me work. Tell me what to do. 
 You have coin on you? 
 Of course. 
 You get to the dispensary, to the London, if need be, and you bring me morphine. 
 Those needs are met, captain, courtesy of Obsidian estates. 
 Umm... Miss Susan Hart, this is... 
 I know who she is. 
 Oh, hello. 
 Miss Erskine? 
 Hello, Mr. Best. 
 Well, this is compassion. It really is. 
 The star you now are, come here to dispense comfort and a few fond words to these poor wretches. 
 They will be all the more grateful you are now returned in such glory to Whitechapel. A picture perhaps? 
 A rose amid the rubble? 
 Oh, will you excuse me, Mr. Best? 
 [Door opens] 
 George! 
 Here, take him off me, will you? 
 [Arthur crying] 
 [Door opens] 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 You are come home? 
 And I am come home. 
 And this. 
 I came to see you, Rose... at the Alexandra last year. 
 You were a marvel. 
 But you did not say hello? 
 I thought it best not. 
 You, uh... 
 You were with a gent after. 
 But you looked happy. 
 And that made me happy. 
 Bennet... 
 It's a long way... 
 Manchester Piccadilly to Whitechapel. 
 What is it brings you here? 
 [Sighs] It's best I do not say. 
 [Sighs] 
 Tom. 
 It cannot be. 
 [Groaning] 
 Tom. 
 You know him? 
 Tom? 
 Tom? 
 [Weakly] Freddie. 
 You comfort him. 
 Hey, I'm here, Tom. I'm here. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Susan : Inspector? 
 Reid : Madam. 
 Such ruin. 
 It is... senseless. 
 These streets... each day, I hope I might have seen the last of their cruelty, and now this. 
 But pure, awful chance. 
 Nothing in this world to be done for it. 
 It is hard medicine. 
 But there will be cause for it somewhere, a root of one sort or other creeping away. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Silence... now! 
 [Tapping] 
 You hear that? 
 Reid : Everybody, after three, get going! 
 One, two, three! 
 [All grunt] 
 I have it. Get it over. 
 Man : Hold it up. Hold it up. 
 What is that uniform? 
 The Necropolis line. 
 Lay him down here. 
 Easy, easy, easy, easy. 
 Drake : What has happened here, Mr. Reid? 
 We are under-resourced, Mr. Drake, and no longer enjoy the benefit of a house surgeon. 
 Drake, there's a laudanum in my bag. 
 Wait! Wait. 
 We cannot drug him. 
 Drake, you tell him that this man is in pain. 
 Mr. Drake, his engine, the Necropolis, its line, the line for Manor Park, it is a mile east of here. 
 He was off course and perhaps the root of this carnage. 
 He  must  talk to us. 
 Intrathoracic and intra-abdominal haemorrhaging, the man's organs are ruptured. They come apart. 
 He must speak. 
 Drake, you're gonna tell him that there is nothing that this man must do, not ever again. 
 He's dying. Now give him the laudanum. 
 Sir? Sir. 
 [Breathing raggedly] 
 You were off course, were you not? 
 Docks. 
 Train on our line. 
 Ma... masked... men. 
 The wires need to be worked, sir. 
 Who's your operator? 
 Constable Grace. 
 Listen, son. 
 Bishopsgate yard and Goodmans... see what report is made, discover what thieved. 
 Do it. 
 He's giving orders, huh? 
 He's inspector now. 
 Inspector Drake now. 
 No sh1t. 
 Arthur. 
 What... uh... 
 Has no one come for you, boy? 
 No father or grandparents? 
 You see that man? 
 Now, he may dress odd and talk odder still, but you can trust him. 
 He can trust you. 
 Stay with him, all right? Only a whiles. 
 Now, wait a minute. 
 One hour, Jackson. 
 Drake! 
 Dr. Frayn : I have never been inside a police station before. 
 Yeah, well, their charm soon fades. 
 You got any idea what to do with one of those? 
 Not even the first. 
 [Smooches] 
 [Sniffles] 
 
 
 
 Four years you are gone, Bennet, four years since I put Captain Jackson out on the street also. 
 And now here, on this day, on that train, you are returned. 
 I heard of your rise through the ranks of the Manchester city police. 
 Enrolled as a uniformed constable, no less. 
 Do you hide your true rank from them? 
 I did. 
 So, you are made anew. 
 What put you on that train, Bennet? 
 Do they not have need of you up there? 
 I'm on leave, sir. 
 Holidaying in Whitechapel? 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Mr. Reid, I meant to say... 
 I  wanted  to say, Inspector... 
 Word reached me... of Mrs. Reid's passing. 
 I wrote, sir. 
 Yes, I know. 
 I know. 
 I was glad for it, Bennet. 
 The signal box. 
 Whatever measure of control sat behind this chaos, that is where it did so. 
 Goods train, the Necropolis driver said. 
 Bound for Bishopsgate and Goodmans. 
 The villains who done this robbed the London and India Dock Company, therefore. 
 And one man up here. 
 More sent far down the tracks to board it. 
 But for it then to be thrown into the path of the Necropolis, whoever stood here must have only have been, what, fetching it here? 
 Fetching it to do their robbing and watched in an abandoned shed hereabout. 
 And this. 
 The man's wrists were bound first, and any further details of his execution, need reading with an expert eye. 
 Mr. Reid... 
 Whatever it is that may have passed between you and the American... these last years, my work has been greatly varied, but I have met no man with gifts... 
 Gifts? 
 For drowning in gin, sleeping in gutters. 
 Inspector. 
 So much death... 
 Whatever his current habits, needs must the best men go searching for the root of it. 
 Then you must ask him Bennet, because he will not hear it from me. 
 Reid : I go to hunt that goods train. 
 Are you here?! 
 We did as you instructed! 
 Every part, as you instructed! 
 Do you know at what price this was come by?! 
 Do you?! 
 Answer me! 
 We have deaths on our hands! 
 Kiddies among them! Kiddies! 
 And I do not merit such guilt! 
 I do not! 
 I want you to take it. 
 Those deaths, the wrong... all yours! 
 Tomorrow... 
 You will have our share, as promised. 
 Otherwise... 
 May god damn you. 
 [Door opens] 
 I wonder... 
 If I were to simply throw it all in the fire, would the last day vanish up the chimney stack, also? 
 Leave you and I here to sit and agree to turn our backs on such villainy? 
 Did not have you marked as whimsical, madam. 
 55, we're now told. 
 55 lives given up for $350,000 in unregistered and anonymous bearer bonds...  because you saw an opportunity. 
 Does this buy back a life? 
 Does this? 
 You are beside yourself. 
 You must calm. 
 Must I? 
 You are my employee, Mr. Capshaw. 
 Best you remember that. 
 And if I wish to burn the evidence of our certain damnation, then I shall. 
 Well, then, burn it. 
 But I currently lack for better ideas of how we might fill the gaping chasm in this institution's finances when the sterling exchange of these bonds will keep our books balanced for 10 years. 
 I've been happy in my work, Miss Hart. 
 I've served you assiduously in the seeming transformation of this house's practices. 
 Yes, we are yet money lender to our neighbours, indeed we are yet so in the certain knowledge of their defaulting thereon. 
 But where is the not much lamented Mr Dugham was content to then acquire their rotten practices to rot further in his own enrichment... you would have us demolish the old and develop afresh. 
 It's an admirable enterprise indeed, but as you know... 
 This house's coffers cannot continue to provide for the brickwork, sewerage, open public spaces, your cherished Obsidian clinic... 
 The new Jerusalem that you will build here, we agreed in. 
 This... is bad money. 
 Bad American money destined for bad ends here in London. 
 We may take it and ennoble its purpose. 
 People have died, god damn you. 
 It's Whitechapel. 
 They die every day... a fact that you, with this, would seek to correct. 
 So this... 
 This in your hands... becomes life. 
 Life, Miss Susan. 
 Or will you instead now wander the way to Leman Street, offer your fragile wrists up to your friend, Mr. Reid, and watch all that you have made, all you would make... fall to ruin? 
 There's a man in a signal box out there, with his brains removed from it. 
 Hey, kid, I paid for that, I expect to see that eaten. 
 First glance, I'd say, a shotgun. 
 [Silverware clinking] Eat it, God damn it. 
 Will you not come? 
 No, Drake, I will not. 
 Reid bounced me so, the poor assumption of yours that four years after you up and disappear, I still carry my lunch in a tin to Leman Street. 
 [Silverware clinking] 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Sighs] 
 He is something. 
 Take a dead man, he'll tell you what he ate for breakfast three days ago and whether it was that which poisoned him or the strychnine in his tea. 
 Indeed, Captain Jackson? 
 Drake, you listen to me. 
 I do not police no more. 
 Jackson... 
 Look around you. 
 This... 
 What must be discovered here in Whitechapel... 
 What all here now need, it is not policing. 
 It is only answers. 
 When did you get devious? 
 [Sniffs] 
 Well? 
 I'm rusty, Reid. 
 You seek the fault of that, look to yourself. 
 There is buckshot. 
 A shotgun is assumed. 
 Our genius has returned to us, huh? 
 It's the first shot, one assumes. 
 Assumed how? 
 It missed, Reid. 
 Missed entirely. 
 The parabola is 6 feet here as it passes through the wall. 
 The shot came from near enough here. 
 The target is, well, there. 
 That's some piss-poor marksmanship. 
 What do we got here? 
 Hmm. 
 Drake, there's a hand lens over there, and... 
 Oh. 
 You've gotten eager. 
 There's heavy damage to both the epidermis and dermis. 
 Over the trauma is in the shape of an oval. 
 The butt of a shotgun. 
 Oh, the mind of this man. 
 But there's patterning here, also. 
 The blow is like a stamp on the man's face. 
 The steel plate of the butt of the gun would have had an engraving, some lettering. 
 There's an "A" and a "W" I can see... and an "R." 
 [Sighs] 
 No? 
 Well, wouldn't expect you to know. 
 They are American guns, after all. 
 It's "W" for "Winchester," "R" for Repeating. 
 Winchester Repeating Arms Company. 
 You got the shells? 
 That's a fine weapon. 
 It's a pump action. 
 An exotic beast in these parts, you might say. 
 Yeah, I might if I were talking to you. 
 It is a straightforward firearm, however, simple and direct. 
 Indeed. 
 And he misses with it. 
 A good 5 yards. 
 It's a heavy gun, however. 
 It's hard to manage. 
 A child? 
 A child? 
 Who has the skill to operate this? 
 Someone impaired, therefore. 
 Therefore, he cannot lift the barrel up for the first shot, so he spoons it to the left. 
 He uses the top rail of the chair to help stabilize his aim. 
 And as you say, Bennet, he is educated in the workings of this system. 
 And in the details of both the timetabling and the tracking hereabouts. 
 But not the engineering work thereon. 
 No. 
 Nonetheless... 
 He would not have been able to acquire this expertise merely by being an enthusiast. 
 He has worked this system at some point. 
 That begs another question. 
 Why shoot him at all? 
 The other men, his accomplices... they wore masks, did they not? 
 And it being some struggle to get that gun up, he must have felt some reason to kill this man. 
 He recognized him, despite the masks they wore. 
 And thus, his silencing. 
 But he is impaired, we are saying. An arm or a shoulder or some such. 
 Yet he knows the system. 
 So, this crippling was what? 
 A well-known, much-discussed misfortune in the workyard perhaps? 
 An uncompensated accident even. 
 Gives him the motive, knowledge, and skill. 
 He was a railway man once. 
 I shall have the London and Tilbury Company wired and their employment records run to Leman Street. 
 As for these shotguns, I have an idea as to where their provenance may be found. 
 What is this place? 
 His new plaything. 
 Reid : Mr. Cree, did I not tell you that in due course, you would be of use to me once more? 
 F.T. Baker, gunmakers of Fleet Street and Cockspur Street, and robbed of five pump-action shotguns three weeks past, an undertaking with which you, yourself, were approached, were you not? 
 They was after Winchesters. 
 What of it? 
 I shan't be asking you again. 
 All right. 
 They was Winchesters. 
 But I didn't take the job. It smelled rotten. 
 Tell Mr. Drake the why, Mr. Cree. 
 Didn't like the look of him. 
 Of who? 
 Allow me, Inspector Drake. 
 "I did not know his name, Inspector. I swears it." 
 He would not say, but 'round these streets, you do get to know most felons, particularly those with the wherewithal of such actions, and I had not seen him this way before." 
 Witness was asked to describe the gentleman in question. 
 And so? 
 He looked wrong... 
 Skinny. 
 Like a village parson got off at the wrong station. 
 Polished his shoes too bright. 
 All shiny, they was. 
 Which a man notices when there's this much sh1t on the street. 
 The London and Tilbury sent their runner, sir. 
 Their employment records. 
 Put Mr. Cree back in his cell. 
 We'll have use of him yet, I hope. 
 Crushed leg. 
 Broken foot. 
 I have you. Here. "Enright, Gregory. 
 Shunter, '92, left shoulder crushed while coupling an engine, to goods stop at commercial road station." 
 Never compensated. 
 Is there an address? 
 There is. 
 [Door creaking] 
 It was perfect. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 No, sir, it was flawed. 
 Everything. 
 I thought I planned for all, but there were details I did not foresee. 
 And you would add more death to a tally that now reaches 55, would you? 
 55? 
 What matters one more? 
 What work it must have been for you, sir. 
 The railways. 
 But to what reward? 
 You put your life into your work, and your work decides to keep that life and not return it to you. 
 You give your commitment, your body and soul, every waking hour, to a world that takes that loyalty, and cares not one spot for you in return. 
 Catch. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Voice breaking] You will hang me now, will you not? 
 That decision will follow from what you now tell me, Mr. Enright. 
 You, sir, are a skilled... you are an ordinary man. 
 Such a scheme the other men gathered, and I do not for a minute believe, you the origin of this atrocity. 
 I'm only Railways. 
 I have only ever been Railways. 
 You were recruited. 
 By who? 
 I never met him. 
 I do not believe you, Mr. Enright. 
 Please, sir, I swear it. 
 He found me. I do not know how, but it was a letter through my door that I was to earn money. 
 You find me a person hereabout, cripple or not, who says no to that question. 
 So you must have then met, seen him? 
 No. We... myself, the other men... we were chosen for one skill or another. 
 You trusted in this anonymous bidder, did you? 
 Sir, I would put my faith in anything that promises me £500. 
 And where is your £500 now, Mr. Enright? 
 We were to get it. 
 When, sir? 
 Later this morning, we are to meet him. 
 Do you know, Mr. Enright, I think I might permit you to fetch your gains. 
 We shall see his face this morning, he who would set men to steal guns... 
 He who exhumes crippled railway men for their learning... 
 He who would leave the dead of Whitechapel behind him. 
 He will be known to me. 
 Still nothing? No report is made? 
 My apologies, Mr. Reid. 
 Whatever was took from that sea can, its owner has still yet to make complaint. 
 How then to know its contents? 
 You have its provenance? 
 Yes, Mr. Drake. 
 The stevedores report it loaded from a domestic cargo transport from Hoboken, New Jersey. 
 Drake : Such a scheme. 
 Whatever it was, we must assume it valuable. 
 Well, I hope, therefore, that Enright and his cohorts provide us with an answer. 
 Or at least their employer. 
 Atherton : Mr. Reid? 
 The men await your instructions as to how that warehouse is to be invigilated. 
 No, no, Captain. 
 Captain Jackson, this is a police assignment, and as such, I'm sure you understand, its details must be considered sensitive, so... 
 My thanks for your service, but I think you might get to your bed or whatever other activity you choose to pursue at this hour. 
 Constable Grace. 
 You're a smart one. 
 He always did like 'em smart. 
 Quick to learn. 
 Well, here's a lesson for you, son... the faster you can quit this man and his work, the better it's gonna go for you. 
 If you don't take my word for it, you just ask the good Inspector Drake here. 
 Coffee? 
 How old are the grains? 
 Couple of days. 
 For which, assume a week. 
 Look, do you want some, or not? 
 I can't imagine it's doctoring you're here for. 
 You're a good deal too grand for me these days. 
 Not an issue which troubles Miss Morton. 
 Yeah well, she comes here for something else. 
 I'm told you once more provide service to the police. 
 That is an old habit in which to fall. 
 Don't fret. 
 It's not something I intend on making practice of. 
 Nonetheless, a woman can be forgiven for thinking time had turned backwards. 
 [Sighs] Look, Susan, I'm tired. 
 Am I'm gonna kick off my boots and go to sleep, or are you gonna tell me what it is brings you here? 
 I am petitioned. 
 [Laughs] 
 Who by? 
 One of the many grateful citizens of your new Republic? 
 I swear, one morning I'm gonna wake up and find you anointed Lord Mayor of London. 
 Ah, which of your constituents, is it petitions you? 
 The bereaved. 
 Those who wait to see if their mothers or fathers or children might yet live. 
 There is one question they ask which unites them. 
 They wish to know why their lives were turned to ruins in a trice. 
 You want to know why those trains collided and against whom the world might lay blame. 
 The  people  wish to know. 
 Mr. Drake? 
 Chief Inspector. 
 Where is he? 
 He's the floor above us, sir. 
 And so... 
 Have you missed us? 
 There is nowhere quite like Whitechapel, Sir. 
 He has asked after the for why behind your return to us? 
 He has. 
 You've told him? 
 This last day, it is not gone by how I imagined. 
 No. 
 But you see why it is I have asked you here. 
 He appears undiminished to me, sir. 
 His commitment, his skills. 
 It is not the loss of such attributes that concern me, Mr Drake. 
 It is the loss of he. 
 Himself. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Inspector. 
 Chief Inspector, you're sent for. 
 He comes. 
 [Rhythmic knocking] 
 Gregory : He has not arrived? 
 No. 
 Little while yet, Railways. 
 Then we shall have our spending. 
 [Door opens] 
 Susan : My canary has sung. 
 Do you assure me, Ronald, that these men who now wait their earnings, they've not seen you? You are sure? 
 Certain. 
 Then those earnings shall remain in arrears, and the police shall have them. 
 They will hang alone and not with you and I beside them. 
 We cannot think they will wait further, Inspector. 
 There is another... their paymaster, the architect of this all. 
 And there is no other means by which this man may be found? 
 There is a man in my cells. 
 He is called Cree. 
 I believe he has met him, but his description is vague. 
 It cannot be pursued alone. 
 And so, we must wait. 
 Enough. 
 Thief : Where  are  you?! 
 I shall sit here no further! 
 You want my advice, you do likewise. 
 Drake : They leave, Mr. Reid. 
 Those men held up an engine on the Bishopsgate line? 
 They did. 
 If we take foot soldiers now, a general walks free. 
 If we do not, Whitechapel must live without knowing its tormentors again, Edmund. 
 Again! This is an order, Inspector! 
 You take 'em! 
 [Whistle blowing] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Come here! 
 Sir. 
 Well, now. 
 This moment might be considered apposite, Mr. Drake. 
 Come now, Inspector. 
 You are no longer to look at your shoes and this man's ambit. 
 Particularly not now. 
 Not now you've rejoined H division at equal rank. 
 What? 
 Without one word of consultation? 
 Consultation? 
 With you? 
 That would be a fine circumstance. 
 I've been clear with you, Mr. Reid. 
 Could not be clearer. 
 Mr. Drake is to aid with the purpose of Leman Street's transition... 
 Transition from your control into his. 
 I've been in earnest about this, my friend. 
 You are for promotion... 
 Promotion away from here. 
 By the time Mrs. Abberline drags me south, you will be gone from these streets. 
 Take them away. 
 You men will be taken next to the prison in which you will last confine, and from there to a place of execution, where you will be hanged by the neck until you are dead. 
 "Thou carriest them away as with a flood. 
 They are like grass which groweth up. 
 In the morning, it flourisheth, and in the evening, it is cut down. 
 For we are consumed by thine anger. 
 Thou has set our inequities before thee, our secret sins in the light of your countenance. 
 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. 
 And we spend our years as a tale that is told." 
 Amen. 
 Together : Amen. 
 Mr Reid. 
 Counsellor Cobden. 
 You are to be congratulated. 
 Swift punishment has afforded us some comfort at least. 
 If you will excuse me. 
 Now we are brazen. 
 Inspector. 
 Madam. 
 A black day. 
 Indeed. 
 Oh. This is my solicitor, Mr. Capshaw. 
 Sir. 
 Your name again, sir? 
 Capshaw. 
 Cree! 
 Herbert Cree!
