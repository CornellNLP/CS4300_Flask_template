 Now, let's see. 
 Yeah, a few of the red ones, please. 
 Special someone, sir? 
 None more so. 
 They say "truest love", red tulips. Did you know that? 
 No, I didn't. 
 For every bloom a meaning, sir, and every colour too. 
 Might the lady care for another? 
 Yeah. Yeah, she likes these. 
 Love forever lasting. 
 Go on, then, let's have a couple of the yellow ones, then I'm off. 
 Well, girl? What meaning these? 
 Love without hope. 
 It's only bloody flowers, innit? 
 Rose? 
 Rose, girl, what happened? 
 You're leaving? 
 What else can I do? 
 He owns this playhouse, Bennet, but he don't own me. 
 Well... 
 What'll you do, girl? 
 Find honest work somewhere I ain't told to let the boss rut and grunt atop me for the privilege of it. 
 I just... 
 I wanted something better for meself, Bennet. 
 Rose, there will be something better, girl. 
 I mean, you've more wits and heart about you than anyone I... 
 You'll see, things'll work out. 
 Things do work out. 
 She's a lucky lady, Bennet, your Bella. 
 I'd, uh... 
 I'd better be on me way. 
 I'm sorry, Rose, I am. 
 Pardon my lateness, love. 
 The inspector needed me... 
 Bella? 
 Bella? 
 You really need me to tell you this wasn't an accident? 
 Smells fishy, all right. 
 What is that stench? 
 It's whale oil. 
 This place was torched with whale oil. 
 Man : Oi! It's the bloody Jews! 
 Hang a noose round the lot of the kike bastards! 
 Who gave you these, boy? 
 Some bloke. 
 Paid me to spread 'em. 
 What "bloke"? 
 I dunno! His face was hid! 
 How about you leave him and chase after the yids what done this? 
 You seem pretty sure who lit that match, son. 
 Left their mark, plain as day. 
 Flight : Is that Hebrew? 
 Flight, get a photographer. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sergeant. 
 I was expecting you at the... church. 
 It's not like her, sir. 
 I know my Bella, she's in trouble, I can feel it. 
 I've, er... I've scoured the streets. 
 I don't know what else to do. 
 You're certain there's no signs of abduction? 
 I don't think so. 
 Least, not what I could see. 
 Bennet, when you first started courting Bella...  ( Clears throat )  ..I had concern... 
 Reid. 
 Concern? 
 Not every wild cat can be tamed. 
 You're wrong about her. 
 Look, Drake. 
 Did you talk to Susan? 
 She's not back on her back! Only to see if she has any other ideas. 
 No! 
 Why don't me and you go ask her, huh? 
 Reid : Long Susan threw you out. Are you welcome there? 
 About as welcome as your advice on every man's goddamn marriage. 
 I just... 
 I just need a small sum for lodging, till I find a new playhouse. 
 Rose, I've got nothing to give you. 
 The music hall remains your best option. 
 So I should just...crawl back to Blewett, then, should I? 
 Let him take what he wants? 
 Doesn't matter how hard we try, does it, girl? 
 In the end, we pay with the basest coin of all. 
 ( Knock on door ) 
 Sorry, are we interrupting something? It's about Bella. 
 She never spoke of family, friends or anyone and I learnt long ago in the running of this house not to pry. 
 Well, was there ever a... another...gentleman? 
 Before the sergeant, that is. 
 Not known to me. Rose? 
 Nor me. 
 I am sorry, Sergeant. 
 I wish I could tell you more. 
 I have matters to attend. You're welcome to finish your tea. 
 Susan. 
 Susan! 
 Goddamn it! 
 Don't touch me. 
 And do not call again on this house, unannounced. 
 Or what? You'll call the police? 
 This is my home, Susan! 
 This is my home. 
 Bennet... 
 You keep away from me, girl. 
 Bennet, I'm your friend. 
 No! 
 No, I should've been home. 
 Not with you. 
 If I'd been home, she wouldn't be gone, would she? 
 Nothing good comes from being round you. 
 Man : Get back! 
 Man : It was the Catholics! 
 ( Man prays in hebrew ) 
 What sorrow the Catholics have visited on us, Detective Reid. 
 Inspector. 
 Mr Bloom. 
 A religious war brews in Whitechapel. 
 Mrs Goldstone said... you were looking for me. 
 I hope someday it is happier circumstances that bring me to your door. 
 Inspector, save your photographs. I saw the graffito for myself. 
 "Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not quake in fear? Shall there be evil in the city, if the Lord has not done it?" 
 The Torah? 
 Is it your belief that the Jews are responsible for the burning of that church? 
 Are any so radical in their views known to you? 
 A boy was... flinging these... outside the shul like confetti. 
 A boy was pamphleteering outside the church also. 
 Peddling anti-Semitic sentiment. 
 A striking coincidence, would you not say? 
 A call to Jews for savage retribution. 
 "Scorch the Gentiles as before with righteous fire for their desecration." 
 ( He whispers in yiddish ) 
 He says no member of this shul would write such words, nor seek such violence. 
 And he is afraid what will befall us. 
 I will not allow the fomenting of hatred in this community. 
 Inspector...the men of these streets are no brotherhood. 
 We are neighbours of circumstance, necessity. 
 The fence of tolerance that pens us is frail. 
 We are not animals here, Mr Bloom. 
 Now that is a radical view. 
 Bella? 
 Bella? 
 ( Gasps ) 
 Oh. 
 I... Forgive me. 
 Forgive me. 
 You're welcome to join us, if you like. We saw you sat alone. 
 Maggie. 
 What I'd like, Maggie, is to be left in peace with my gin. 
 I didn't mean... 
 I just thought you... 
 Was a time not long past I was needful of friends and was lucky to find some, is all. 
 I'll leave you be. 
 Evening, pretty one. Tug us off? 
 I'll rip it off! 
 ( Laughter ) 
 Hello! 
 Bella. 
 Where have you...? 
 Bennet, this is Gabriel. 
 Who?! 
 My uncle. 
 Your uncle?! 
 Gabriel Kane. 
 I... 
 Where were you? 
 I've been out of my mind, girl! 
 I left a note. 
 A note? 
 No, this... 
 I swear it wasn't there. 
 Bella, I've been searching all over. I thought... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 The apology should be mine, Mr Drake. 
 My visit was unannounced and I brought with me the worst of news. 
 My daughter, sir. 
 Lily. 
 For some months the typhus had clawed at her. 
 Lily had uttered many times a wish to see once more the sweet face of whom she, in happier times, had cherished, dear as a sister. 
 When, by chance, Bella's whereabouts became known to me, I came without a second thought and, in no less haste, Bella rushed to spend the night by Lily's side. 
 Did she...? 
 She passed, sir. 
 Before sunrise. 
 I am sorry. 
 Bella never spoke of any family. May I ask of Lily's mother? 
 The sun does not rise upon a single day without my yearning for her. 
 This meal is delicious, my dear. 
 I feel blessed to be in your home. 
 There is no tie that binds more than family. 
 Do you not agree, Mr Drake? 
 Oh, I, er... I never knew much of family. Until Bella. 
 She tells me you took the queen's shilling. Egypt, was it? 
 For a time. You? 
 No such privilege, sir. 
 My travel was undertaken not for queen and country, but for study. 
 I travelled through Sinai en route to Persia, Bengal. 
 The study of what? 
 All kinds. 
 Exploration, anthropology. 
 A seeking, you might say. 
 Seeking of? 
 Truth. 
 I stayed for a time at a shelter for women, but... 
 These streets deal a poor hand to men and women alike. 
 We're sisters and brothers here. 
 All of you live here? 
 And plenty more besides. 
 They'll demolish all this soon enough for roads or trains or factories but until these bricks are rubble, any who come needful of shelter or friendship can find both. 
 ( Murmur of conversation ) 
 ( Clinking of plates ) 
 ( Laughter ) 
 There's soup, if you're hungry. 
 Oh... 
 I have new friends too. 
 Father will be happy with you. 
 Samuel, this is Rose. 
 How do, Rose. 
 Samuel is one of Father's finest students. 
 You did well last night. 
 "Thou brakest the head of leviathan in pieces, gavest to his people inhabiting the wilderness." 
 Excuse me, Rose. I am requested. 
 ( Knocks on door ) 
 What's in there? 
 That's Father's chamber. 
 Who is this Father? 
 He found this place for us. 
 Made us a family. 
 You'll meet him tomorrow. 
 A bed for the night, Maggie. 
 That's all. 
 Come the morning, I make my own way. 
 I can't make you trust us, Rose. 
 But I can tell you that each soul here, when first they came, had reason never to trust again. 
 Rest. You will not be troubled. 
 Bennet. 
 Bella... 
 Bella, I thought you'd... 
 That note. It wasn't there. 
 It was there, Bennet. 
 I swear. 
 It was there. 
 You never once spoke of them. 
 Gabriel. Lily. Anyone. 
 It felt like they were in another life. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, that's all right. 
 It's all right, my love. 
 This entire day can kiss my holiest of holies. 
 Home. You with me? 
 It's not your home, man, it's mine. 
 Look at these, will you? Do they not strike you similar? 
 Reid, listen to me. 
 First, I'm gonna drink this. 
 Then I'm gonna throw up. 
 And then...I'm gonna drink this. 
 And then I'm gonna pass out. 
 Now, you wanna make use of my brain, do it now. 
 I know a thing or two about bone setting. 
 But you're sh1t outta luck when it comes to typesetting. 
 And on that, I bid...adieu. 
 Best : Panic in the air, streets on the brink. Just like the good old days. 
 Reid : And now this. 
 Circulating on Underwood Street this morning. 
 Yeah. Heard St Anne's Church took a pasting the like of the synagogue. 
 Whoever sets Jews against Gentiles will do the same for the Irish. 
 The pamphlets. Did they come off the same press? 
 You must have me confused with the psychical two doors down. 
 If you wish my torch of truth to illumine the holy mysteries of ink and type, quid pro quo, Inspector. 
 That's foreign, chum. 
 You must have an ear for it. 
 Me old china. 
 A church burns on our doorstep, man! 
 This is no penny dreadful to be eked out over your grubby pages. 
 You came up through the print-works, did you not? 
 An ink-streaked urchin, giddy with hot lead and hungry to one day rule the Fourth Estate. 
 Truly, William Stead must quake at your rivalry. 
 "Quid pro quo"? 
 You seem to labour under the belief that we have some "arrangement". 
 A symbiosis, as the biologists would say. 
 But there is no biologist yet that has a name for what you are. 
 Come, Sergeant. 
 We need the opinion of a professional, not a muck-shoveller. 
 Wait. 
 Right, see this. 
 The smudge? 
 We call it a slur. 
 See, some of these are printed fine enough, but every few, a slur. 
 Meaning? 
 Looks like they were printed on an Albion. 
 Lovely old press, but a bugger with the trems. 
 It's vibrations. 
 From? 
 Door slam, floor thump, anything that would make the room shake. 
 Christ, you could fart, it would make the platen do a judder. 
 These slurs. They're regular. 
 Same disturbance each time. 
 Then go look for a clockwork flatulent. Look, I've work to do, gentlemen. 
 Sergeant, I, er... 
 Bennet, I... Forgive me... 
 I am happy for you she's home safe. 
 I hope some day... 
 I'm able to say to you likewise. 
 ( Carriage rumbles ) 
 Trains. Could it be the trains? 
 Years back I lived in a place by the tracks. 
 Room shook like an earthquake every half-hour. 
 Can you determine if these pamphlets were printed using the same ink? 
 Like Friedlieb Runge does. 
 Friedlieb who? 
 Runge. I saw a lecture about his experiments with dye. 
 Colour patterns. 
 Those wily cabbage-eaters. 
 Is it possible? 
 Yeah, in theory, I guess, sure. 
 But what would be the point? 
 There are maybe seven or eight brands of ink vended wholesale to printers. 
 So, even if you found the match, Reid... 
 Yes, the field remains wide. 
 But how many print-shops who purchase this type of ink are situated near enough to rail tracks for this slur? 
 It's lucky for you I'm a gambling man, Reid. Send Flight shopping. 
 I need samples. 
 Here's your ink, right here. 
 No doubt about it. Compounds. 
 You see? 
 Precisely the same. 
 Heylin's Black Empire, number 4. 
 Who uses that? 
 There's one, um...two printers that buy it, near enough tracks. 
 But this one, it's right on the London & Blackwall, sir. 
 Get me a hansom! 
 Gaddis! 
 Here's the Albion, sir. 
 Whale oil? 
 ( Heavy breathing ) 
 Samuel Gaddis. 
 Gaddis... 
 Was it you...alone? 
 ( Train rumbles ) 
 Father. 
 Why? To what end spread such hate? 
 We got him, leastwise. 
 ( Knock on door ) 
 ( Door opens ) 
 Oh, you're still here. 
 I started reading and... 
 That's Father's. He's written so many. What did you think? 
 Do you believe all this, Maggie? 
 That there's some better world to come? 
 There is, Rose. 
 I've seen it. 
 I couldn't to begin with, of course. 
 I... I had my doubts, as you do. 
 But Father helped me to see. 
 And the truth, when at last we glimpse it, can be so bright, it dazzles. 
 Stay a little. Meet Father. 
 He'll help you understand. 
 I don't think so, Maggie. 
 Thank you for your kindness, but...I'll make my way. 
 Forgive me. 
 
 
 
 You must be hungry. 
 You're a kind soul, Maggie. 
 That's what Father says. 
 I do so wish you would stay to meet him. 
 ( She gasps ) 
 Father, I cannot. 
 The years without you have passed as centuries. 
 Fate has brought you back to me. 
 Now you must renounce your adultery with this man Bennet. 
 What matter it was one night or two years past when the hurt remains afire? 
 He is a good man. And I would not have you lie to him. 
 I love him! 
 And I love you. 
 I love Bennet. 
 Then bring him to us. 
 I have waited for you. 
 As did Lily. 
 She howled for you... 
 Gabriel, don't! 
 If you'd stayed... she'd have found the will to fight the illness. 
 I had to leave. 
 I was a child myself. 
 But you're a child no longer. 
 ( Indistinct voices pray ) 
 Do you not think your Bennet... who has seen, just as I... the vicious face of Man... who has waded in the blood... who this very day takes desperate threadbare broom to the filth of the streets... 
 Do you not think such a man would understand our work here? 
 I would not have you leave him to the sordid vanity of this world. 
 If you love him, my Bella... save him. 
 ( Door creaks ) 
 ( Gasps ) 
 Philip! Maggie! 
 You go round. 
 Rose? You're safe with us. 
 ( Fly buzzes ) 
 Rose! 
 Save him. 
 This book, The Golden Bough, it's extraordinary how he picks together the common thread of... religion and mythology, folklore. 
 God's a fairy tale. This is news? 
 His thesis is somewhat more intricate. Thesis? 
 Man'll pin up any rag he can to veil himself from the naked truth. 
 There's a thesis. 
 The naked truth being...? 
 That we're born alone, we die alone, and not one thing in-between makes a jot of goddamn sense. 
 Pray with me. 
 Say, Reid... 
 This whole rumpus with Drake's old lady. 
 You really buy that long lost uncle thing? 
 Not especially. 
 No. 
 Question is, does Sergeant Drake? 
 Good luck broaching that subject. 
 You think him a cuckold? 
 Love. 
 Love someone, you gotta trust them. 
 Love. All of it. 
 That's just an act of faith. 
 If you don't got that, what's left? 
 You're saying he should demand to know the truth. 
 I'm saying I got a feeling for why he hasn't. 
 Man'll pin up any old rag. 
 ( Clatter ) 
 ( She inhales sharply ) 
 You're hurt. 
 You hurt yourself. 
 There's a bit of blood, but it's not too deep. 
 ( Knock on door ) 
 Er, just hold that tight. 
 I was passing. 
 No. 
 What is it, girl? 
 Not yet, Gabriel. 
 No more lies. 
 Not now! Get out! 
 Explain yourselves! 
 Is that not a wifely duty? 
 Who are you? 
 Will you have at me with your billy club? 
 Bennet, no! Leave him be, I beg you. I'll explain. 
 I beg you. Just go! 
 Whoever you are, you bring strife at your back. 
 Now hear me good - you come near her again, you'll wish it was a billy club. 
 Now, get out of our home. Go! 
 ( Door shuts ) 
 I lay all my love at your door, Bella. 
 There is no burden you can share that I would not shoulder beside you. 
 So, please... just tell me. 
 Who is he? 
 Eh? 
 Was he your...? 
 Did you...work for him? 
 Do you wonder, Bennet... what turn life might have taken if you'd done things different? 
 What things, girl? 
 A left when you went right. 
 A yes when you said no, anything. 
 If you'd wed Rose in my place, for instance. 
 Do you think she'd have made you happier? 
 There is no man in this world has ever known the happiness you have brought me, Bella. 
 But do you wonder? 
 No, girl. 
 Rose is... 
 She was... 
 W... 
 I don't want to talk about Rose. 
 I want to talk about Gabriel. 
 I think she'd have made you happier, Bennet. 
 Jesus! 
 At least she never kept secrets from me. 
 ( Door opens ) 
 He was about to set flame to the English Martyrs. 
 The church full for service. 
 A constable was passing, saw him ready bottles of whale oil outside. 
 Made for him. 
 At which he doused himself, lit a match. 
 Goddamn it! 
 The constable said he was in the grip of some...rapture. 
 Incanting, ecstatic amid the fire. Just as Gaddis did. 
 These...fanatics would have Whitechapel torn apart. 
 Who are they? 
 Sergeant? 
 Forgive me, Inspector, I, um... 
 Mrs Drake? 
 Take the day, Bennet. 
 There is work to be done, sir. 
 And there are sometimes matters more needful besides. 
 I learned as much too late and to my own cost. 
 Go to her. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Find something, man. 
 Your brother Jacob gave himself this morning unto the flame. 
 Leapt forth, wings spread, as did Samuel Gaddis before him. 
 They did so with neither fear nor sorrow, for they knew to which bright and fabulous place they would soar. 
 But, Father, Jacob was stopped before... 
 Do not think him failed in his purpose. 
 Jacob brought this day a clarion to their door. 
 It is from love we seek to stir the lost flocks of this city, rouse them from their drone-lives of prayer in false temples. 
 It is from love we set tribe against tribe. 
 Only to teach them what hate is bred from their dung-hill idolatries. 
 And by the light of your steps, those lost flocks will soon follow. 
 And by your love... you will show them the meaning of Faith. 
 Bennet! 
 Oh, thank Christ. 
 I was coming to find you. 
 Not now, girl. 
 I saw her, Bennet... 
 Bella, with a man. 
 What man? 
 They... 
 They called him Father, but what I saw, it... 
 I wouldn't lie to you, Bennet! 
 Shut up, girl! I can't bear to see her cuckold you. 
 Rose, I... 
 Rose! 
 Vigilantes, Inspector. 
 Protecting themselves from the "Hebrew menace". 
 Come. 
 There is some kabbalah...here. 
 The rest I cannot read, but I can tell you it is the script of John Dee. 
 Dee? The mathematician? 
 Mathematician, yes. 
 But alchemist also and astrologer to the court of Queen Elizabeth. 
 A keen student of the occult who came to believe he was conversing with angels of apocalypse. 
 This was their language. I need to know who studies this. 
 Inspector, there are many scholars of such material. 
 And their number grows. 
 With its every triumph of discovery, the Age takes hammer and chisel to Man's pillars. 
 Is it so surprising there are those in need of new pillars? 
 No, not surprising, Mr Bloom. 
 Dismaying. 
 And I would not have thought you so accommodating of hocus-pocus. 
 Of course. 
 What use the folly of God to the rational mind? 
 You are for Progress, Science, Truth. 
 And you are not? 
 Oh, I am... rational, Inspector. 
 And I hear, every day, men such as yourself, who would have us believe our journey to Truth will set us free. 
 But Man has no more desire for Truth than a dung beetle. 
 Like any animal, he desires meat and s*x. 
 And like any animal who feels himself caged by what is... he will yearn for anything that lies beyond the bars. 
 Dee called it magic. 
 You call it progress. 
 You are a cynic. 
 I am a scientist. 
 The only thing as irrational as faith in God is faith in Man. 
 The printer who made these said his last prayer and cut his own throat open in front of me. 
 I must know which "scholars" have taken such leave of their reason. 
 A printer? By what name? 
 Name of Gaddis. Samuel Gaddis. 
 Inspector...are you familiar with the Order of the Golden Dawn? 
 Welcome to Isis-Urania. 
 Jemima Swann. 
 And you are... a policeman. 
 I am Inspector Reid. 
 And I need to know about Samuel Gaddis. You interrupt my study, Mr Reid. 
 If your business here concerns Mr Gaddis... 
 Samuel Gaddis is dead, Miss Swann. 
 And my business concerns...this. 
 This is not his own work. 
 Then whose? 
 Gaddis was... 
 He was the disciple of a great adept, a man named Gabriel Cain. 
 Where is Cain? 
 He too left, but this is his work, I'm sure of it. 
 Then help me find him. 
 He disappeared. 
 He was the finest scholar I've known. 
 He travelled further, read wider, thought deeper than any other. 
 But he saw only a world drenched in its own cruelty. 
 He came to believe that a great cataclysm drew close, fit for such corruption. 
 Kalki. Destroyer of Foulness astride his white horse, sword of fire to cleave all darkness. 
 Gabriel believed... he was the sword of fire. 
 Is he insane? 
 He is a man of faith, not madness, and that is why people follow him. 
 And did you? 
 Inspector, I expelled him from this Temple, but a circle formed around him. 
 Gaddis. 
 First among those who believed Gabriel was their shepherd to the future. 
 And this. 
 A clarion. Gabriel's own testament. 
 He spoke of leading his followers from this world. 
 And he is preparing to do so. 
 What does that mean? 
 Is he going to kill them? 
 No, Inspector. 
 They will kill themselves...in their numbers, in pure exaltation. 
 There, at the founding of Isis-Urania. 
 It is the only likeness of him. 
 This girl... 
 She was his holy queen. 
 Her name? 
 He named her Bella. 
 She is with child. 
 Inspector... 
 I cannot, Gabriel. 
 I will not bring him to you. 
 Please...leave us be. 
 Please come in, Mr Drake. 
 Your love for him is not real, Bella. 
 It is. 
 No, it is not! 
 For me, your love is real. 
 For him, there is nothing. 
 ( They recite prayer ) 
 Who are you? 
 Where's my Bella? 
 Come... 
 What is this place? 
 You see? It is destiny. He has come without you having to bring him. 
 Bella, what...? 
 Who is he? 
 Her teacher. 
 Her saviour. 
 And father of her child. 
 She died, Bennet. 
 Her name was Lily. 
 I left... 
 I left her... 
 She died for want of her mother. 
 No... 
 Bella. 
 Bella wishes you, as do I... to join us here. 
 Let our Holy Family welcome you and save you from a world you know to be black in heart and red in claw. 
 Bennet, no! 
 Bennet! 
 It's Edmund. 
 Bennet! 
 Jesus! 
 Drake. 
 You have anything? 
 Oh, maybe. 
 I found this in his gut. 
 Peyote. 
 Back home, the Indians use it to commune with the spirit world. 
 Sort of a...religious rite. 
 I've heard of it - hallucinations, trance states. 
 Yeah. That would account for the raptures of Barbecue Bill here. 
 Hardly a common narcotic on these streets, though. Where would one obtain it? 
 In London? Believe me, I wish I knew. 
 It's from a cactus, is it not? 
 Lophophora williamsii. Cut from the crown and dried out. 
 There is an abundance of horticulturalists and flower-sellers in this city, but how many of them do you suppose sell exotic cacti from the American desert? 
 Flight! 
 ( He gasps ) 
 This is my body, which is broken for you. 
 If you do not, I will have Philip break his jaw and smash out every tooth. 
 You will wake, and we will be together. 
 ( He groans ) 
 What lies before us...take it not for mere play. 
 Through its array breathe the angels themselves. 
 You know them, don't you, Bennet? 
 Especially your goddess of war. 
 This form of chess was born in India, centuries past. 
 There is a belief amongst the Hindus that the world is in its final era. 
 An age of vice, degeneracy, avarice. 
 But, day by day, the gyres spin apart - Samhara draws close, bright dawn devouring every shadow. 
 Look not upon her with the name of another on your lips. 
 Your Rose. 
 Of course Bella told me. 
 I know all of it. Now I shall bring your Rose to you and, together, you can enter the next life. 
 And you shall enter it on wings of light and know at last that you have come home to a world stronger and more loving than any you could dream. 
 ( Glass smashes ) 
 Ooh! 
 All right, Rose? 
 Do what you want. 
 Come on, Rose. 
 Bennet? 
 Bennet? 
 Forgive me. 
 Forgive me. 
 It is Rose. 
 It's your Rose. 
 Rose. 
 Shh. 
 Forgive me. 
 Shh. 
 Cummings Horticulture. 
 Purchase orders for Lophophora williamsii. 
 All these orders...the same address. 
 I'll get a Maria. 
 Wait. This... 
 The same purchase - Atropa belladonna. 
 Belladonna? They've bought nightshade. 
 That's how they're gonna kill themselves. 
 They're gonna drink goddamn poison. 
 They brew that up, every single one of them's dead within a half-hour. 
 There's some things I need. 
 Hurry, man! 
 "When flowers will be begot within flowers, then will the Yuga come to its end." 
 As foretold, the hour of reckoning is upon us. 
 Where you ascend to this day, know that your brothers, sisters and Father follow. 
 To take this glittering cup is to split asunder the chains of this world. 
 When my daughter took her brave steps into the light... 
 I understood at last that I was but an instrument of that light. 
 It beamed from a world which called upon all those with faith and wisdom to give themselves unto it. 
 As the butterfly casts off its husk to soar, shall you leave forever this land of the dead. 
 Maggie : It is time. 
 You shall be reunited with your love. 
 Where's Bennet? 
 With his brothers and sisters. 
 They're so blessed, Rose. 
 As will you be...tonight. 
 Gabriel's light will flood inside of you. 
 Drake! 
 Cain! Show yourself! 
 Cain... 
 It is as I foretold. 
 Witness a miracle, sir. 
 I am saving them. 
 Behold a simple man embrace his rapture. 
 He drank his fill ten minutes ago. 
 No! 
 Get her away from him! 
 Calabar extract for anyone who drank. 
 You hold his head to the right. 
 Open up, Sarge. 
 Please, no... 
 Forgive me. 
 Shh... 
 Forgive me. I... 
 I killed you... 
 I-I killed you all. 
 He's going to be all right. 
 Huh? 
 Ain't that right, friend? 
 You're gonna be all right. 
 Sit him down. Sit him down. 
 Bella! Please! 
 No, Bennet. No, Bennet... 
 Please let me see my Bella, please! 
 Ah! 
 No, Bella! 
 I deserve my shackles, Bennet. 
 I'll rot in them for what I've done. Then you can have her. 
 No, girl. 
 I know you loved her first. 
 I've always known. 
 I tried to be the best I could for you, but I could never be her, could I? 
 It isn't true, Bella, please... 
 What place for me in a world without your love? 
 No! 
 No, please! Jackson! 
 Please...! 
 Please... 
 Whitechapel's carpenters and builders lend their skill at no cost. 
 Jew, Gentile, Irish, English. 
 I hear the same is true of the churches. 
 A man might, in his softer moments, have to concede something to your creed of progress. 
 I daily witness that which would cause any sane man to deny the very notion of good... in God or in Man. 
 And there are times when I have thought to do so myself. 
 When I saw my...daughter vanish in flame and darkness, that day the dwindling spectre of a God vanished too. 
 But I cannot - I will not - believe that...Man... that we are not... 
 We are caged by what is, you said. 
 But to see no further than the bars... that is a terror I could not endure. 
 Tomorrow may be a brighter place. 
 Perhaps those who believe it are the fortunate ones. 
 For a man without faith... is a man without hope. 
 Bennet. 
 Bennet, I... 
 If you... 
 If you've ever need of a friend... 
 Take your hand from me, girl. 
 I am made of nought but death. 
 Bennet? 
 Woman : Still hunting for your beau, are ya? 
 Rose : I've got a picture now. 
 Have you seen him? 
 I've seen him. 
 Where, Gracie? 
 Nowhere you wanna go, girl. 
 You are a sight for a weary man. 
 I thought you were dead, you son of a bitch! 
 My house is no longer my own. 
 How many blows will it take to fell this man?
