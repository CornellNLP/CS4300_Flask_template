 Previously on  Legacies...   
 If I return the knife to Malivore, I will be free.   
 What's Malivore?   
 It's a hell dimension that consumes creatures and wipes their existence from the collective conscience.   
 ALARIC:  Yesterday I came into possession   
 of another Malivore artifact.   
 Now monsters that shouldn't exist   
 have been coming after it.   
 How long do you think it'll be before the next monster shows up?    
 - Do you think I'm broken? 
- Of course not.    
 I think your biological mother's   
 crazy-ass witch ancestors left you   
 with a legacy of darkness that you have to work through.    
 I don't ever want to hurt anybody.    
 I'm here now to help.    
 LIZZIE:  I'm surprised that you have time  with all of the private training sessions    
 you've been doing with Hope Mikaelson.   
 Speak of the actual devil.    
 You sure it glowed again?    
 I sleep with the damn thing under my pillow..    
 It's hard to miss.    
 What do you think it's gonna be this time?    
 Hmm? Cyclops?    
 Slender Man? Santa?    
 [CHUCKLES] Well, given our luck, I think it's safe    
 - to rule out Ol' Saint Nick. 
- I don't know.    
 I mean, Santa Claus is kind of terrifying when you think about it.    
 Breaks into your home.    
 He sees you when you're sleeping.    
 Not to mention, judge-y.    
 - Hope, I need you to focus. 
- Look, I'm trying.    
 I just wish that Satan's nightlight    
 - would give us some rest. 
- Yeah.    
 And I wish that knife was never in our school to begin with, but it's not like we can change that now.    
 All we can do is make sure we're not blindsided by another monster waltzing through our doors.    
 [LAUGHS]    
 Too late.    
 Oh, God.    
 Uh, girls. What are you doing here?    
 You're not supposed to get in until tonight.    
 Mom was able to get us direct into Dulles.    
 Then faxed, texted and e-mailed you    
 - our revised itinerary. 
- ALARIC: I am so sorry.    
 It's-it's chaos around here.    
 It's okay, Dad.    
 We know that you're overwhelmed.    
 But Europe was amazing.    
 And seeing Mom was really good.    
 LIZZIE: Jo's covered the bright side.    
 Far less sunny was waiting for you in the chilly dark of morning at the terminal and you not showing up.    
 In his defense, um, we've been in crisis mode around here.    
 Oh, we've heard all about it.    
 Hope got bamboozled by one of the monsters and now only two keys separate the entire supernatural community from being consumed by a hell portal.    
 I'm guessing that weird little vase is one of them?    
 It's an urn, actually.    
 I don't care what it is.    
 I care that instead of being welcomed at the airport, we were forced to take a three-hour shuttle ride that smelled like an open sewer.    
 And feet.    
 Thanks a lot, Hope.    
 Way to ruin life for the rest of us.

 Well, who else would there be? [CHUCKLES]     
 Now go get dressed. You're giving a tour in ten minutes, and I really need you to sell the new recruit on our place.     
 He's not sure he wants to go here.     
 Who wouldn't want to go here?

 I'll tell Dad to add that to the budget after he pays the gas bill.     
 Wait. [LAUGHS]     
 Are we... poor?     
 Lizzie, you know how expensive it is to run this place, how hard it is to get benefactors.     
 I mean, Damon Salvatore has been as generous as he can be, but he and Elena have kids of their own that they need to take care of.     
 I'm gonna make sure that Dad eats.     
 He works so hard.

 JED: Huh.

 Yeah?     
 This place sucks.     
 Hope's dad wrote my mom a big check to fund the school when it opened, so no Hope, no funding, no fun.     
 Fix it.     
 Oh, is that to be your next wish?     
 Yes, that will be my... Wait.     
 I know how this goes.     
 I waste my first wish by not being specific enough.     
 I waste my second one trying to clean up my first, only to make things worse, and then my third gets wasted by wishing that I had never had any wishes in the first place.     
 I won't fall for it, Genie.     
 - [CLEARS THROAT] It's Jinni. 
- That's what I said.     
 I'll beat you at your own game.     
 Make the best of this rat trap.     
 Send me back in.     
 ALARIC [SIGHS]: I know, Caroline.     
 I am sorry I sent you on a fool's errand to Idaho, but this is an inexact science and we only have so much to go on.     
 We'll find new recruits, I promise.     
 LIZZIE: This is how we find new recruits?     
 Why are you acting so weird today?     
 Well, no wonder our school is lame.     
 But fear not, family.     
 I know how to help.     
 Where did you get that?     
 In the archive room.     
 We don't have an archive room.     
 Well, now it's more of just like a storage closet, but no matter.     
 This is the solution to all of our recruiting problems.     
 It's like a locator spell, only it's interactive.     
 The instant a new, young, supernatural being is awakened to their powers,     
 this bad boy lights up.     
 ALARIC: That's incredible.     
 H-How do you know how to do this?     
 An annoying, know-it-all witch I knew in another life created it, so I just copied her spell.     
 Go ahead.     
 Give it a spin.

 There's so many of them.     
 All waiting for us to come to their rescue, Daddy.     
 Oh, well, there...

 Everything you are experiencing is, in fact, a potential reality that has occurred as a direct result of your wish.

- This world does make sense, when you think about it.     
 Your father built the Salvatore School so  you  could thrive.     
 You and your sister were born of a dangerous coven known for breeding... 
[WHISTLES] psychotics, and so he built a safe place to shield you from your darkest impulses.     
 And then you went and wished his dream away because it wasn't perfect.     
 Well, now the students here don't care about protecting your fragile ego.     
 So you are the school freak, and your sister gets to shine.     
 Just tell me how to get out of here.     
 Well... you could use another wish.     
 But, like I said, language is important.     
 Besides, you think I want to be here?

 [SIGHS]     
 Sweetie...     
 ...you can't be here.     
 [MURMURING]     
 You ran away.   
 I've been worried sick, looking for you.     
 Why would I run?     
 You don't remember what happened?     
 Must be some sort of amnesia triggered by the trauma.     
 - What trauma? 
- It doesn't matter now.     
 All that matters is that you're home.     
 Not that we can stay much longer.     
 Triad's closing in every day.     
 The world knows about vampires?     
 You've forgotten more than I thought.     
 Klaus Mikaelson lost everything that anchored him to his humanity, and so he shut it off two years ago and started a war.     
 Outed supernaturals in the process.     
 And just like that, Triad had an ugly, racist platform to stand on, and nothing's been safe ever since.     
 Where's Josie?     
 Dad.     
 Where is she?     
 She's dead, Elizabeth.     
 The vigil's for her.     
 No. [SHUDDERS] No, no.     
 She-she can't... she can't be.     
 That's not what I wanted.     
 I know. But, right now, you just...     
 - need to get some sleep. 
- No.     
 
 
 
 [EXHALES] No, no.     
 I-I can... I can fix this.     
 I-I can make this whole miserable world go away.     
 Josie's not really gone.     
 I promise, okay?     
 I'll fix it.     
 Genie?!     
 Genie?!     
 - Genie! 
- Elizabeth, please, please...     
 This was my last wish. [EXHALES]     
 I can't take it back.     
 [CRYING]: Oh. I've ruined everything.     
 - Oh, no. It's my fault. 
- Penelope.     
 It's all my fault!     
 Penelope!     
 [SCREAMS]     
 [SOBBING]     
 [CREAKING]     
 Damn you, Genie.     
 It's Jin...     
 [EXHALES] Never mind.     
 Don't be so hard on yourself, even if your father did just lock you up in a cellar for your own safety.     
 Third wish is always tricky.     
 Better luck on your next one.     
 My next one?     
 I-I get another wish?     
 Whoever told you a jinni only grants three?     
 Aladdin.   
 Every genie story ever.     
 A  Jinni  can grant or ignore any wish they choose.     
 We won't work against our own self-interest, so you can forget about wishing me dead.     
 But if you'd like another wish to reset your life right back to where we began,     
 I can do that.     
 On one condition.     
 Anything.     
 What?     
 You give me the urn.     
 LIZZIE:  Oh, I knew you were  gonna screw me. You used my words against me,     
 - right from the start. 
- [CHUCKLES]     
 Like you said, I'm a monster.     
 Should've trusted your gut.     
 You trapped me in the worst situation imaginable, just so you could get what you want!     
 The urn is a small price to pay to cease suffering like this.     
 You don't know anything about suffering.     
 Don't I?     
 As all jinn are, I was born into five centuries of suffering.     
     years of realizing other people's dreams before I'd ever have the chance to pursue one of my own.     
 And in the    th year of my term, I crossed paths with a true monster.     
 And it consumed me, sent me to a place of total isolation, utter damnation.     
 Malivore.     
 I know.     
 So what?     
 I wandered there, lost and alone, until I was given one final chance to win my freedom.     
 So accept my offer and wish me the urn.     
 If I wish you the urn, I'm giving you the key to a supernatural apocalypse.     
 Isn't that technically against your self-interest?     
 Quite the opposite.     
 It's my only hope.     
 Because if I return the urn to Malivore, then I am free and at peace. Whatever happens after that is not my problem.     
 Selfish.     
 Said the pot to the kettle.     
 I don't know why we're debating.     
 This life is dreadful.     
 So wish it away!     
 Shut up, okay?! I just...     
 I need to think. I need to find a loophole.     
 There is no loophole.     
 Magic always has a loophole.     
 Yeah? Well, you better find it quickly.     
 Things are taking a hell of a turn up there.     
 What do you mean?     
 [PANTING]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 Dad?     
 Lizzie.     
 Did Penelope let you out?     
 We've been working on getting the right dosages for you.     
 What are we doing? Are we hiding?     
 No, we're fighting.     
 Triad got wind of our location.     
 With Josie gone, we decided to take a stand and put an end to this once and for all.     
 Oh, God.     
 You're gonna get slaughtered.     
 And it's all my fault.     
 No, it's my fault.     
 I should've never kept that secret from you.     
 What secret?     
 Your mom and I had been waiting for the right time to tell you a piece of your family history, but... we waited too long.     
 What family history?     
 There's something that happens to twins born into your coven, like you and Josie.     
 When you turn   , the Gemini must merge.     
 Merge?     
 It's a battle of will.     
 Only the strongest of the two twins will survive it.     
 So one of us would have to kill the other one?     
 We've been trying to find a way to prevent it ever since you were little kids.     
 That's why your mom's always off traveling.     
 We tried to keep it from you as long as we could.     
 But when we turned the house into a rescue operation, one of the witches who was passing through told you the story of the Gemini, and you...     
 Dad, what did I do?     
 You got scared.     
 You had one of your episodes, and you went dark.     
 Paranoid.     
 To you, Josie became your biggest threat.     
 You became obsessed with winning, and then you lost control.     
 [CRYING]: I killed her.     
 It was an accident.     
 No matter how you say it...     
 ...I killed her.     
 You must hate me so much.     
 No.     
 The only person I hate is myself for failing you both.     
 No. Dad, I've been to other places, other realities, and I know that that sounds crazy, but you need to believe me.     
 You always do everything that you can to protect me and Josie.     
 Time after time.     
 World after world.     
 Then I wish we could be in one of your other worlds right now.     
 No matter what happens, I need you to hear this.     
 To believe me.     
 There's a world where your dream came true.     
 You built a school for me and Josie, and it was so beautiful.     
 And we were safe and loved.     
 And you helped so many people.     
 And I was just too stupid and jealous to see it.     
 In this other world, did I tell you about the Merge?     
 Then I guess we were both pretty stupid, huh?     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 It's time.     
 No. Dad, wait.     
 I can get us out of this.     
 I just need to think.     
 That's a good idea.     
 You think, baby.     
 [VOICE BREAKING]: I love you.     
 I love you so much.     
 [CRYING]     
 Let's go give them their war.     
 [CHEERING]     
 Think. Think.     
 Not exactly your strong suit.     
 This would all go so much easier if you'd just accept my offer.     
 Zip it, Smurfette.     
 I know there's a way we can both get what we want.     
 I just have to think of the perfect wish.     
 As I've told you, I will not grant you anything unless it involves me finding peace.     
 - And I said quiet! 
- [EXPLOSION]     
 Maybe you need a little incentive.     
 Incoming!     
 [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]     
 Icaeus.   
 Incentivized?     
 Okay, fine.     
 Bouncing through your wonky worlds taught me something.     
 I  am  selfish.     
 I've made mistakes.     
 But giving you the urn would be the biggest mistake of all.     
 It could ruin everyone's life, destroy my father's dream of making any reality a better place.     
 It's bad enough that I did that to him time after time. I can't do it again.     
 You sure about that?     
 When I fix this, he'll be fine.     
 And I won't give you the satisfaction of breaking me.     
 You were already broken. That's why I chose you     
 - in the first place. 
- That just means that you can't break me any more.     
 So read my lips.     
 I am never wishing you that urn.     
 You want it so bad?     
 Why didn't you just take it when it was right in front of you?     
 Because you can't.     
 That's it, isn't it?     
 You said it yourself.     
 You can only do what someone wishes you to do.     
 That's your curse.     
 And you are just as broken as I am.     
 But I know how to fix you.     
 How?     
 By winning your dumbass game.     
 I wish that you had never met the monster that sent you to Malivore.     
 Huh.     
 If I never went to Malivore...     
 You'd have completed your     years of service.     
 [EXHALES]     
 I'd be free.     
 That's my wish.     
 Take it or leave it.     
 Your wish is my command.     
 Boom! Suck on that!     
 But there's a catch.     
 We will never have met, either, which means...     
 I won't remember the Merge.     
 Not consciously.     
 You'll be just like all those poor souls I helped over the centuries who used their final wishes to reset their realities.     
 What happened to them?     
 They found their worlds just as they left them.     
 Only their minds weren't.     
 Because somehow our journeys stayed with them and slowly drove them insane.     
 It's like you said.     
 There's always a loophole with magic.     
 And when you find out your father's secret, as you inevitably will, history will likely repeat itself, and you'll kill Josie all over again.     
 - I take it back. I-I wish to... 
- I thank you     
 - for my freedom, Lizzie. 
- No!     
 I said wait!     
 [ECHOING]:  Wait!   
 JOSIE: Lizzie?     
 Lizzie.     
 Lizzie?     
 Please don't be mad at Dad.     
 Oh. What's happening?     
 - Why are you suffocating me? 
- I have no idea.     
 Look, I don't know when it started, but on a fundamental level, I think I'm broken.     
 And I realize this is all very sudden, but I just, for whatever reason, have this feeling     
 that something terrible is gonna happen if I don't change.   
 ALARIC: I... I'm so sorry, Caroline.     
 I know, I should not have missed your texts about the kids.     
 It won't happen again.     
 Lizzie's been vibrating pretty high.     
 You think she's on the verge of an episode?     
 Yeah. All right.     
 I'll keep an eye on her.     
 Any other leads?     
 [SIGHS] All right.     
 Well, keep at it.     
 We'll find a solution.     
 - Yeah. 
- [PHONE BEEPS]     
 [SIGHS]     
 [KNOCKING AT DOOR]     
 You got a sec?     
 Well, this morning's evidence to the contrary,     
 I always have time for you.     
 What's on your mind?     
 I'm sorry about earlier.     
 Mom gave me all of these tools to manage my ups and downs, but... they all go out the window when it comes to Hope.     
 That seems pretty self-aware.     
 What brought this on?     
 I don't know.     
 Well... maybe it'll come to you.     
 In the meantime, I appreciate you trying.     
 I love you, Dad.     
 Aw. I love you, too, sweetheart.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 What's that?     
 Oh! This is...     
 nothing you need to worry about.     
 [SIGHS]     
 LIZZIE:  The thoughts in my head,   
 I think that they have something to do with Hope.   
 - Hey. 
- Hey.     
 - What's all that? 
- Oh, I was thinking we could spell a barrier around the urn so when the next monster shows up, we can trap it.     
 Want to help?     
 Pass.     
 But I can't put my finger on it.   
 I feel like I'm losing my mind.     
 Any thoughts?     
 I don't know, Lizzie.     
 Sounds like you got a lot going on.     
 [WHOOSHING]     
 Isn't it past your curfew, Pedro?     
 Go to bed.     
 And leave the sandwich.     
 But you said you wanted to talk.     
 Did I?     
 [SIGHS]     
 Can't imagine why.
