 LIZZIE:  Welcome to the Salvatore School.   
 - I'm Josie. 
- I'm Lizzie. Sisters.   
 We are a school for the supernatural.   
 Which covers a lot of territory.   
 HOPE:  I'm a hybrid of three different creatures.   
 Tri-brid.   
 I knew Hope went to some fancy boarding school.   
 People in town said it was for troubled rich kids.    
 This is a safe place for people like Rafael.

- ALARIC:  I'm sorry, Langdon.   
 - But you don't belong here. 
- Then where do I belong?    
 I'm still nursing a wounded soul.    
 Penelope Park.    
 I am an equal opportunity

- JOSIE: MG?

 [YELPS]    
 I'm not gonna remember any of this.    
 Probably not.    
 LANDON:  Well, in that case.   
 - What's wrong? 
- The alarm didn't trigger.    
 - ALARIC:  What was it? 
- DORIAN:  Knife.   
 Supernatural origins unknown.   
 HOPE:  How do you know it was him?   
 It's not possible, okay?   
 I'm not that stupid. I know how to track him, but it involves using dark magic.    
 Inveniet hostium et tenebrae. Inveniet hostium...   
 DONOVAN:  Local PD thinks it was a chemical spill.   
 ALARIC:  What's the actual story?   
 DONOVAN:  I'll leave that to you to figure out.

 HOPE:  "No legacy is so rich as honesty."   
 When Shakespeare wrote that, he obviously didn't know what I know about teenage boys.   
 I mean, I know there are guys with integrity, who lead with truth.   
 I've just never met any of them.   
 EMMA:  I see you've decided to double down on your nihilism this morning.   
 I'm trying to be rich with honesty.    
 Start from the beginning.    
 Of my short-lived but horrific romances with liars?    
 Of your decision to perform black magic on school grounds last night.    
 Maybe we could table this until I catch the guy I was trying to find by using black magic.    
 Because the longer that Landon Kirby is out there, the greater the chance he tells people about this school and the kind of people we have hidden behind the gates.    
 You know there's a beacon that alerts me when someone's using.    
 You knew you would be caught.    
 After I found Landon, but we lost the trail and now I'm being interrogated.    
 But go ahead, take your time.    
 Nothing at stake here.    
 Did anyone help you with the spell?    
 No. Can I go now?    
 Hope. You're a student.    
 - This isn't your fight. 
- It's absolutely my fight, Emma.    
 Landon was inside the walls of this school because of me.    
 He had access to the knife he stole because of me.    
 We're at risk of exposure because of me.    
 And you can tell me that I'm sublimating a lifetime of survivor's remorse, or whatever it says in my file here, but I'm gonna help Dr. Saltzman find him.    
 And what happens when you do?    
 HOPE:  It should be said that Shakespeare wasn't completely clueless.   
 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
-  He had plenty of advice about how to handle betrayal.   
 My personal favorite: "Think, therefore, on revenge and cease to weep."   
 Let's hit the dining hall and carb load.    
 It's game day.    
 I'm not hungry.    
 - What? 
- Well, uh, funny thing actually, Josette.    
 This morning, as I was desperately trying to make this trash bag of a jersey look cute, I suddenly had the urge to purge.    
 So I fled to the bowl, and lo and behold, I heaved up a gallon of black goo.    
 So, seeing as I haven't been dabbling in any illicit black magic recently,    
 I can only imagine it was a twin sympathy hurl.    
 And here you are, denying the day's most important meal.    
 So fess up. What did you do?    
 PENELOPE: Maybe you're pregnant, Lizzie.    
 Oh, or maybe it's just how that jersey fits.    
 Go away, evil one.     
 Already gone. Hot tip: next time you burn your ex's hair off, make sure she can't rock a lob.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Morning! Big game today...     
 Bounce, MG.     
 If you hurry, you can catch up with the Blair Bitch and tongue-chum her again.     
 Did she who shall not be named just fat-shame me?     
 - Hey, girls, listen. 
- Don't do it.     
 Don't say whatever it is you're about to say because you have Dad face, and wherever Dad face goes, daughter disappointment always follows.     
 I'm sorry; I can't make the game today.     
 But, Dad, you're the coach.     
 And I'm QB  this year.     
 I hate it as much as you do, but I have to find Landon Kirby.     
 Okay, so, let's cancel.     
 I mean, it's a joke anyways.     
 We can't use our powers, so we suck.     
 Exactly. Which is a normal school for troubled rich kids thing to do.     
 This annual event lets the locals see you for what they think you are.     
 And keeps them from asking too many questions.     
 But they mock us.     
 Because they're insecure, small-town kids with small minds.     
 So just let it be. Look, girls, with Landon running around, knowing all of our secrets, we have to protect our profile now more than ever.     
 Can I count on you guys to do that?     
 All right. I love you both.     
 We'll be back as soon as we can.

 You're going after Landon.     
 If you want this car to work, I'm going with you.     
 You should stay out of it. 
He's a liar and a thief.     
 He took a stupid knife.     
 Nothing in this school is a stupid anything.     
 Look. He's my best friend.     
 And you? You seem vengeful.     
 Let me show you something.

 What the hell was that?     
 Your best friend did that to a bus full of people on Route    last night, and I am the only one who knows how to find him, so give me the engine thingy.     
 No.     
 I have actual magic powers.     
 And I have a long history of anger issues.     
 He can come.

 Dad loves Hope more than us.     
 You're being melodramatic, okay?     
 He's missing one game.     
 First a game and then our weddings.     
 This game is an opportunity.     
 We can show him how seriously we are taking this by making sure that our secret stays protected out there on the field.     
 Today, we will lose even more epically than we normally do.     
 Win by losing. That's the spirit.     
 There's someone we need to recruit to our Island of Misfit Toys.     
 - Tall, hot and handsome. 
- Rafael?     
 I am totally thinking tight end.     
 PENELOPE: I just saw him.     
 Yeah, sorry, Raf's not gonna be at the game.     
 He hopped the Hope train out of town.     
 Just like your dad.     
 I don't know why he's still out here.     
 He has a whole day's lead on us. He could be anywhere.     
 Maybe 'cause he doesn't have a reason to run.     
 [SCOFFS] Logic that would be perfectly believable

 I think she's in shock.     
 Look, I need to get her to the police so she she can get some medical attention.     
 Uh, why don't you two go ahead? Don't engage.     
 We don't know how dangerous Landon is.     
 - He's not dangerous...

 I was being recruited by D  schools before I got here, all right? I don't lose.     
 Hey. You do today. Okay?     
 Good luck out there.     
 Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.     
 I'm pretty sure I've seen that on a poster at the dentist's.     
 Oh, my dad's a dentist, but he still made time to be here.     
 I guess I'm lucky that way, huh?

 No one knows.     
 It's like something incinerated it from the inside.     
 Look, whatever he did, I know there's a good explanation.     
 He's the most loyal friend that I've ever had.     
 He was there for me on the worst day of my life.     
 After my girlfriend died, he's the only thing that kept me going.     
 So let me get that knife back for you and then we both can hear him out, okay?     
 Appreciate the passion, but maybe you should exert some of it making new friends.     
 So I can be as popular and well-liked as you?     
 Yeah,     
 I've been at the school for two days and I've already heard all about Hope Mikaelson and her sunny disposition.     
 I'll get you the stupid, not-stupid knife and the answers you want.

 And why should I believe you?     
 Because I don't lie.

 I'm calling an audible of my own.     
 - Seriously? 
- I'm dead serious.     
 And you should be, too.     
 Dad told us to lose today for a reason.     
 Well, he ain't here. So screw that.     
 JOSIE: Yeah, no one would be here if it weren't for him.     
 My dad built this school for supernaturals like us, so if we win by flaunting all the things that make us different, we're gonna lose a lot more than a stupid game.     
 We'll lose everything.     
 You really want Dad to stop loving us? Keep it up.     
 And if you don't...     
 MG: She's right, Lizzie. 
We got to lose the game.     
 I didn't ask for your opinion.     
 Or... door number three.     
 Okay, we definitely didn't ask for your opinion.     
 And how on earth do you always do that?     
 It's like she appears out of smoke.     
 Hold up, hold up. 
What's door number three?     
 You win, without any of your supernatural special sauce.     
 Fair and square.     
 Yeah, but we're legitimately terrible.     
 No, we used to be terrible, but Kaleb's new this year.     
 So am I. I can help us win, too.     
 Yo, I caught that pass earlier.     
 JOSIE: Yeah, but you cheated.     
 - You used your powers. 
- No, I didn't.     
 I'm... I'm just, I'm scrappy like that.     
 Good idea, Satan.     
 But to be clear, you can't have my immortal soul.     
 Fair and square.     
 Let's do this.

 Huh. Okay. So much for research.     
 What are you reading,  Game of Thrones?   
 "Puff, the Magic Dragon."     
 Look, this just doesn't make any sense.     
 I-It has got to be something else.

 Nope. It's a dragon, all right.

 She wants this. She's going to be back.     
 All right, you two, go to the car.     
 I'll meet you there. Go, go.     
 You wake up with a death wish today?     
 Something like that.     
 [CHANTING]: We want to hear you say go!     
 Okay, guys, last play of the game. It's Hail Mary time.     
 - Everyone but Josie, go long. 
- Wait. What do I do?     
 It doesn't matter, 'cause there's no way I'm gonna throw you the ball.     
 Lizzie. Look my way. I'll catch it.     
 Probably caught something from Penelope Park, too.     
 KALEB: Knock it off.

 What is this?     
 This isn't earth magic, Hope.     
 This wasn't an earth magic problem.     
 We don't allow black magic.     
 It gets inside your heart and it poisons your mind.     
 Now, I looked the other way this morning 'cause I knew you were upset, but this is a death spell.     
 A spell you couldn't have known you need to use on a dragon, which... which means you had other plans for it.     
 Landon did something stupid, maybe evil.     
 We won't know until we learn more, but... he's still just a kid, Hope... and so are you.     
 This hatred... this vengeance...     
 This is your father.     
 It can't be you.     
 I won't allow it.     
 Now, you bury her.     
 And I'll see you back at the car.     
 Hey.     
 Oh, whoa, towel on. Please.     
 'Cause vampire or not, the last thing I want to see is your lost boy.     
 Damn, Peez, you gotta stop lurking.     
 It's time for a strategy sesh.     
 Nah, I listened to you all day, and the only thing your little tricks did was make the wrong girl look my way.     
 I'm out.     
 This is a long con, Milton. Trust me.     
 Lizzie's nemesis Dana liking you, oh, that's the puzzle piece you need to crack Lizzie's candy shell and get to her gooey center.     
 Today was a total win for you.     
 You hate Lizzie. Why do you care?     
 Some people just want to watch the world burn.     
 You mad at me?     
 No.     
 I'm mad at the world, and you just happen to be in it.     
 Well, you're about to be.     
 I did a little spell at the game.     
 I made Kaleb drop the ball.     
 And I totally did black magic with Hope.     
 Well, let's just call this what it is.     
 You betrayed me.     
 I was worried about disappointing Dad.     
 So I disappointed you instead.     
 I'll forgive you if you promise not to keep secrets about doing black magic with Hope.     
 You're my sister, my best friend, and she spent the last ten years making us feel like we don't matter.     
 And I don't like feeling that way.     
 Not from Hope, and not from girls like Dana, not from Dad and not from you.     
 I promise.     
 Okay? I'm sorry.     
 It's okay.     
 I mean, betrayal and all aside, you had my back today.     
 And you had mine.
