 Previously on Legacies I found a way to bring back everyone's Malivore memories. 
  Landon, I love you. 
  LANDON: Monsters aren't the only problem. 
  So I have to leave, knowing that they'll follow me. 
  When the moon reaches its apex tomorrow night Simume will disintegrate. 
  It's the only way anyone can think of to close the portal. 
  CLARKE: My consciousness will transfer to the next person I cut. 
  (GRUNTS) 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Ah, yes, I did a spell to alter your appearance. 
  Turn you into the most vile thing I could imagine. 
  I just look like me. 
  - Then I nailed it. 
  - Huh. 
  I thought you'd rather stare at Landon's sad little face. 
  Sorry. 
  To be honest, I'm glad you're here. 
  You clearly hate me, so I can't imagine why. 
  Because there's still time for you to come to your senses before you toss me into the pit. 
  One, it's more of a ditch; two, I'm really looking forward to it; and three, you're trapped inside a magically created body that expires at midnight. 
  Save your breath. 
  There's no one coming to save you. 
  You're going into a grave you dug for yourself. 
  Oh, my God, it's snowing. 
  Oh, boy. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER, SHOUTING) 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Hey! 
  No fair. 
  Wasn't even looking. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Okay. 
  Kaleb. 
  What the hell is going on? 
  Don't be a Scrooge, Hope. 
  It's Christmas. 
  No. 
  It's October. 
  Christmas is a state of mind. 
  It's a feeling in the air. 
  Now you feeling it? 
  Definitely feeling something. 
  I'm Dreaming - Of a white - I got here as fast as I could. 
  On the drive over, I saw snowmen going up all over town. 
  Kids on sleds, and adults running around like idiots, stringing up Christmas lights, drinking cocoa. 
  Did someone say "cocoa"? 
  This is bad, Dorian. 
  This has to be the work of another monster. 
  And the last one gave us a prophecy that we need to figure out, so you need to turn that music off, and get your head in the game. 
  And you need to get your ass off the naughty list, Ric. 
  Okay? 
  So, like I said, cocoa, and then we can talk about whatever it is you want to talk about. 
  Now, what were you so worried about? 
  I, uh don't remember. 
  Of a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days be merry - And bright - (LAUGHTER) 
  Dr. 
  Saltzman. 
  I need your help. 
  (BOTH LAUGHING) 
  What are you wearing? 
  Dorian had an extra one. 
  Lucky me, right? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  No, Ric. 
  We're the lucky ones. 
  Because Dr. 
  Saltzman is gonna spend Christmas with us. 
  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you. 
  Lizzie! 
  We get it, Hope. 
  You're back. 
  Now disappear again. 
  Ah. 
  You're still a bitch. 
  Thank God. 
  What? 
  - What is happening? 
  - I don't know. 
  It's like everyone in the school is happy except for us. 
  Too happy. 
  Like scary happy. 
  Merry, even. 
  They all think that it's Christmas. 
  And the snow probably doesn't help. 
  It's snowing? 
  How? 
  Uh, another monster, I'm guessing. 
  This is terrible news. 
  It's freaking fall. 
  Not winter. 
  What am I gonna wear? 
  Something to travel in? 
  I'm gonna need you to hit the road. 
  You want me to quest for Frodo Baggins, don't you? 
  I thought that the monsters weren't after him now. 
  We don't know what they want, or even who they're working for anymore. 
  I just need Landon to be safe. 
  (EXHALES) 
  Fine. 
  A little locator spell and then off to Mordor I go. 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  I come bearing gifts. 
  More like a peace offering, really. 
  I thought that the three of us had already made peace. 
  Well, this whole school year, I have been really naughty. 
  I've not been the supportive sister that I want to be. 
  And then there's Landon. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  It was wrong of me to be jealous when his subconscious just chose you. 
  But thankfully, Christmas is all about forgiveness, right? 
  Cookie? 
  Run. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  What kind of cookie? 
  (EXHALES) 
  Dude, you didn't have to get me anything. 
  I mean, we don't even know when my birthday is, just that it's this month. 
  Okay, then today's as good a day as any. 
  Open it up. 
  Um, it's I have no idea. 
  So while you were trapped in wolf form, I had Josie do a lineage spell to see if you had any ancestors who might know how to turn you back. 
  I figured it was a long shot, but she got a hit. 
  Your parents. 
  My parents are dead, Lan. 
  That's what we thought. 
  But the people who raised you till you were ten weren't your real parents. 
  How do you know that? 
  Because locator spells don't work on dead bodies. 
  This is leading us straight to North Carolina. 
  The same place that this bus is going? 
  I've seen how much you've been struggling. 
  I thought maybe meeting your parents might help you heal. 
  It's your call, Rafael. 
  Deck the halls With boughs of holly Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la 'Tis the season to be jolly I'm trying to work! 
  So if you don't fa-la-la-la leave, I'm gonna give you all another piercing. 
  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
  Sounds like someone could use a little help - getting in the spirit. 
  - You want to help? 
  Find me an ax. 
  So that's a neg on the nog? 
  I need to figure out what monster's making everyone so freaking merry, then kill it. 
  Whoa. 
  That's naughty as hell, Hope. 
  I got to do all I can to make it on Santa's nice list. 
  'Cause I've been asking for this one thing every Christmas and, uh, I never got it. 
  But I'm hoping that this is the year. 
  (SLURPING) 
  Oh. 
  Hell yeah. 
  You sure you don't want to hit this? 
  If I started hitting stuff now, I might never stop. 
  There's got to be someone around here as miserable as I am. 
  CLARKE: You're right. 
  I am miserable. 
  So why would I help you? 
  Believe me, I wish that there was another option, but you're the only one around here that's not eating figgy pudding. 
  On the bright side, me being miserable must be why I'm immune to the Christmas spirit. 
  What's your excuse? 
  I used to love the holidays. 
  But I lost a lot of my family, and everything changed. 
  Everyone running around here all thankful for what they have You realize what you're missing. 
  What? 
  If anyone can relate to being alone, it's me. 
  I've never even had a Christmas. 
  That's it. 
  You want my help figuring out your monster? 
  Let me eat, drink and be merry for once in my life. 
  Go out with a bang. 
  Now (CLEARS THROAT) 
  should old acquaintance be forgot? 
  Come on, we're almost there. 
  Uh, do you remember the last time that you tried to reunite a father and a son? 
  I just need you to consider that when Josie returned all of our memories, I remembered everyone that went into the Malivore pit, and it wasn't just Hope. 
  Your mom. 
  Was meeting her everything I hoped it would be? 
  No. 
  But I'm really glad I did. 
  I just wanted to give you the same chance. 
  And I hear that. 
  Bro, you are the only family that I need. 
  So let's-let's just keep moving before another monster catches up with us. 
  - Raf, please - Let go of me! 
  I-I can't I can't deal with this right now. 
  - I just - Okay. 
  It's okay. 
  Let's just get out of here. 
  Let's just get out of here. 
  (GUN CLICKS) 
  I think you boys better come with me. 
  All right, pass those ribbons around. 
  Everybody write down your Christmas wish on them. 
  Don't let anyone see it. 
  Then when you're done, I want you to toss your ribbon into the fire. 
  - There you go. 
  - (WHOOPS) 
  My bad, Pedro. 
  Me and Santa got some unfinished business. 
  More where that came from. 
  Oh, what fun it is to ride What's your wish, Jo? 
  Well, if I tell you that, it won't come true, remember? 
  One-horse open sleigh - - O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtails ring Making our spirits bright Wow, you really are the son of a bottomless pit. 
  A sleighing song tonight Thanks. 
  Here. 
  Turn. 
  Quit stalling. 
  Tell me what I'm looking for before I run out of goodwill towards mud men and there are unpleasant consequences. 
  Mm. 
  My best guess? 
  The Krampus. 
  What the hell is a Krampus? 
  Well, it's the monster that brought all this snow and ice to town. 
  And think of it as the anti-Santa. 
  Santa Claus rewards good boys and girls, right? 
  Well, the Krampus does the opposite. 
  It seeks out hatred and anger instead of peace and joy. 
  We're literally surrounded by peace and joy. 
  Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to Not for long. 
  What did you just do? 
  You should be proud of me, Hope. 
  I took a page out of your playbook. 
  It is to ride I found another loophole. 
  Cloustrum. 
  You're spelled inside this room. 
  Now, what exactly did you wish for? 
  You'll find out soon enough. 
  Because as you can attest, I've been a very bad boy this year. 
  (GRUNTING) 
  Unpleasant consequences, remember? 
  Now what did you wish A savior. 
  (GASPS, GRUNTS) 
  You want to protect Landon, right? 
  Well, don't worry. 
  The Krampus is coming to rescue me instead of going after him. 
  And it'll kill anyone dumb enough to get in its way. 
  Not if we're ready for it. 
  By "we," do you mean the school full of idiot kids drunk on Christmas cheer? 
  Or the grown men running around actually drunk, believing that Santa Claus is real? 
  Good luck dampening their spirits and getting them to listen to you. 
  You leave that to me. 
  (RADIO CRACKLING) 
  LIZZIE: Would you literally stop pushing my buttons? 
  So, she finally speaks, eh? 
  Sorry. 
  But modern machinery fascinates me. 
  This gas-guzzler is older than dirt. 
  My dad's friend gave it to me and Josie for our sweet 16. 
  We should stop for fuel, then. 
  I could also use a proper meal. 
  By which you mean Uh, whoever else stops for fuel. 
  Yes. 
  You should've eaten before we left. 
  You know, you confound me, Elizabeth. 
  You know, when you made me this daylight ring, I assumed it was a ruse. 
  That you merely wanted to spend time together beyond the loathsome confines of your school. 
  Well, then, you assumed wrong. 
  The only reason that you're here is because you keep me perpetually un-jolly. 
  Well, we both know that's not true. 
  I'm here because you fancy me, obviously. 
  You command this vessel like a drunken pirate. 
  I just saw some deer. 
  If you're so hungry, why don't you go eat Bambi? 
  Is this some kind of test? 
  You bet your ass it is. 
  And he makes me want to watch you move Around And you failed. 
  (TIRES SCREECHING) 
  HOPE: Can I have everyone's attention? 
  I need everyone's attention. 
  (CHATTER STOPS) 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  I have bad news. 
  A Krampus is headed our way. 
  (BOY COUGHS) 
  (MUSIC PLAYING) 
  (CHEERING, LAUGHTER) 
  Concido. 
  Whoa! 
  HOPE: All right! 
  Didn't want to deploy the nuclear option, but Santa's not real. 
  He's a myth. 
  And you're all acting like a bunch of children. 
  So let's just put the partridge back in the pear tree and grow the hell up. 
  She's right. 
  I This was all too good to be true. 
  I I, uh, I don't know what came over us. 
  All right, you all heard her. 
  Dorian, hit the books, figure out how the Krampus operates. 
  Josie, Kaleb, we need to set a trap for this thing. 
  Everyone else, get the kids to bed and gather weapons. 
  And someone bring me a crossbow. 
  This is all a-a misunderstanding. 
  We were just lost. 
  RAFAEL: A werewolf cage? 
  I saw your eyes. 
  I know what you are. 
  What you're going through. 
  You're a werewolf. 
  No. 
  But I was in love with one. 
  I met Lucia in Afghanistan. 
  But if she'd known what would happen after she took a life, she never would've enlisted. 
  When we got back to the States, she was like a lot of us: fits of anger, memory loss, trouble with crowds. 
  A classic case of PTSD. 
  Until that first full moon hit. 
  Uh, why do you why do you keep talking about her in the past tense? 
  What happened? 
  Lucia was the bravest soldier I ever knew. 
  The only time I ever saw her scared was when she found out she was pregnant. 
  You two had a-a kid? 
  First full moon after she learned she was expecting, she was just gone. 
  I searched for her for years, but a soldier like her who doesn't want to be found never will be. 
  But I thought about her and our baby every day since. 
  So it's time you told me why you're here. 
  Because you have more than just your mother's eyes, Rafael. 
  Merry Christmas, Krampus. 
  I believe you have something for me. 
  No, that-that's not what I asked for. 
  I wanted another trident. 
  (GRUNTS) 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  You were supposed to save me. 
  (GRUNTING) 
  (GRUNTING) 
  (SHRIEKS) 
  (COUGHS) 
  I'm guessing you're the Krampus. 
  (SCREECHING) 
  Mittent. 
  I'm Hope. 
  And I find the holidays really stressful. 
  (CACKLES) 
  Damn it. 
  That thing could be anywhere. 
  Wait. 
  I thought my father was bringing the Krampus to save me. 
  But I was wrong. 
  He must have known I was planning to jump into a new body and screw him over again. 
  How? 
  Well, I don't know. 
  But if you let me go, I can make it to the portal before the Krampus kills me. 
  Nice try, but "fool me once" and all What if there was a way that I could prove to you that I'm on your side? 
  That I'm telling the truth. 
  RAFAEL: I thought I had laid the anger under control, but but it just came back worse than ever, you know? 
  Being at school it helped, because there was-there was other people like me. 
  But it turned out that it-it wasn't the right place for us, you know. 
  Sometimes you have to leave to protect the people you love. 
  I think that's why my mom gave me up. 
  Believe me, I get it. 
  I know running away can feel like it's the only option. 
  Sure I can't get you something to drink, Landon? 
  I'm good, Walt. 
  Thank you. 
  For everything. 
  Um, I'm just gonna grab some air, if that's cool with you. 
  Uh, yeah. 
  Hey, Lan. 
  I think maybe you were right about coming here. 
  (DOOR CLOSES) 
  Hop in, hobbit. 
  Lizzie? 
  One more word and I will feed you to the flames of Mount Doom myself. 
  Illustrant. 
  (HISSING) 
  (SCREECHING) 
  (THUNK) 
  Straight in the heart. 
  That's how you kill a Krampus. 
  Anyone want some cocoa? 
  Yeah, sure, why not? 
  It's Christmas. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  HOPE: Wait, you two are still merry. 
  If it's dead, then why hasn't this lunacy stopped? 
  (GROANING) 
  Everyone stay back. 
  Whatever's in that thing is coming out. 
  Ho, ho, ho, ho! 
  Who wouldn't be merry on this special night? 
  (ALL MURMURING) 
  SANTA CLAUS: Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
  It's the magic of Christmas, Miss Mikaelson. 
  It's the most wonderful time of the year. 
  Santa? 
  I can't believe you're real. 
  Well, of course you can. 
  You see, my dear Hope, belief is what makes things real. 
  Uh Yes? 
  How did you know her name? 
  Because everyone was a child once, and I remember each and every one. 
  Besides, a name like Alaric is pretty tough to forget. 
  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! 
  (LAUGHING) 
 
 
 
  I-I must thank all of you for bringing me back. 
  It's been hard, all these years, being trapped in that awful, dark place, unable to spread joy around the world (SCREECHING) 
  (ALL GASPING) 
  (HISSING) 
  because of you. 
  Thought I killed that damn thing. 
  Language, Dr. 
  Saltzman. 
  Don't blame yourself for missing. 
  The Krampus' heart is very small, and this is my fight. 
  Wait, Hope, no. 
  You heard the man. 
  This one's personal. 
  So you thought you could steal Christmas, did you? 
  Ho, ho no. 
  Leaving Hope and Josie without having the balls to say why was one thing, but now you're ditching Raf? 
  As long as monsters are after me, he's in danger, too. 
  I needed to find someplace where I knew he'd be safe. 
  So what is your plan, Huck Finn - Ride the rails? 
  - My only plan is to make sure that nobody else gets hurt because of me, because that really sucks. 
  Come back to the school with me, face Hope and Josie, and then they will help you face whatever comes next. 
  We all will. 
  What do you say? 
  - (SNAP) 
  - (GASPS) 
  I say you people talk entirely too much when action is required. 
  We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year Dude's fast. 
  We wish you a Merry Christmas Like, really fast. 
  We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year - Good tidings to you - (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) 
  How do you think I make it to all those houses in one night? 
  (CLICKS TONGUE) 
  Oh, bring us some figgy pudding Oh, bring us some figgy pudding You better watch out! 
  And a cup of cheer Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi Santa. 
  Oi, oi, oi Ha! 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Hyah! 
  STUDENT: Yeah! 
  We won't go until we get some We won't go until we get some We won't go until we get some So bring it out here We wish you a Merry Christmas (CHEERING) 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  See? 
  Very small indeed. 
  We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year Well, this settles the matter. 
  You are a terrible pilot. 
  I didn't think that being with you could get any more miserable. 
  You are only angry because your plan to abandon me has failed. 
  What are you doing? 
  Put your shirt back on. 
  You know, I sussed it when I was tracking you down. 
  That is the reason you brought me along, wasn't it? 
  So you could just, what, ditch me like some unwanted puppy. 
  I mean, more like a perk, really. 
  You shouldn't be at the school. 
  You call my friends parsnips. 
  No, they're turnips. 
  Okay, whatever vegetable that they are, they don't like you. 
  No one does. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Except for you, Elizabeth. 
  For the last time, I don't "fancy" you or whatever. 
  I might even hate you, Sebastian. 
  You made me think that I was crazy. 
  Well, perhaps we both are. 
  For I fancy you, Elizabeth. 
  Did that line work in the Middle Ages? 
  Yes. 
  Yes, it did, as did my abdominal muscles, but all that truly matters is that it's working now. 
  No, it isn't. 
  Mm, 'tis. 
  - 'Tis not. 
  - 'Tis. 
  'Tis not. 
  'Tis. 
  Okay, you are insufferable. 
  But lucky for me, there is something called an aneurysm spell. 
  Which you cannot cast. 
  Uh, not without touching me. 
  I said put your shirt back on. 
  Okay, you know what? 
  Whatever. 
  You are forgetting that there is a perfectly good dead phoenix in the trunk. 
  And you are forgetting that I am dangerous. 
  Stop talking. 
  Action is required. 
  (PIANO PLAYING) 
  Can't say I expected to talk to you again. 
  CLARKE: Me neither. 
  But before I die, I wanted to tell you that you're wrong. 
  I don't hate you. 
  And that the truth spell you cast on me is still working, obviously. 
  The snow melted. 
  I'm assuming that means the Krampus is dead? 
  Yup. 
  Santa Claus killed him. 
  This Christmas was surprisingly violent. 
  In that case, I have a clean run to the portal. 
  At least I can enjoy the last ten minutes of my life. 
  Well if you want to talk, I'll listen for as long as I can. 
  The tree I think I'm jealous of you, Hope. 
  Because you're just as screwed up as I am, but your friends still love you. 
  Will find me Guess I always wanted to believe my father could do the same. 
  Where the love Anything can be real if you believe in it enough. 
  Merry Christmas, Hope. 
  Merry Christmas, Clarke. 
  For Christmas If only In my Dreams Sure you have to go? 
  Yeah, I got to head back to the school and get myself some help. 
  Being a soldier's in your blood. 
  Always moving forward. 
  I'll get my keys. 
  Give you a ride, at least. 
  Or I could I could take the first bus out. 
  Uh, what about your friend? 
  Landon's better at surviving than anyone I know. 
  Besides, I think I can learn a lot from you. 
  I mean, if if you don't mind me, uh, crashing. 
  SEBASTIAN: I am glad you accepted the truth. 
  You fancy me very much indeed. 
  I fancy s*x with you. 
  The jury's out on all the rest. 
  Would more copulation convince you that I should stay at the school? 
  Uh, I-I Why would you even want to stay? 
  Besides the copulation. 
  Because I have nowhere else to go. 
  In my five centuries of being on this planet, little has changed in the way that people treat one another. 
  This world is cruel to those it considers broken. 
  But the Salvatore School, for all its (CHUCKLES) 
  aggravations, is different. 
  It's the kindest place that I have ever been. 
  That's why I want to stay there. 
  If you'll have me. 
  Holy night I've been looking for you. 
  What are you guys doing? 
  Packing up Christmas. 
  Well, it's not over yet, because Santa left this for you. 
  Then that's for you. 
  Really? 
  What do you think it is? 
  It's perfect. 
  Damn! 
  Nice ride! 
  Oh. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Thank you, Kaleb. 
  To be honest, I much prefer my reindeer. 
  To a '75 Vette? 
  Sorry. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  My-my crazy-ass Uncle Earl had this exact same car. 
  I've wanted one since I was a kid. 
  Well, that's why we give gifts during the holiday season. 
  To remind us that it's important to have dreams. 
  Because sometimes, they come true. 
  Merry Christmas, Kaleb. 
  (LAUGHING) 
  Wha For real? 
  Ho, ho, yeah! 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  (SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING) 
  Ho, ho, ho! 
  Merry Christmas, Hope! 
  This is the part where you say something. 
  Or run. 
  It's both. 
  Can you please just wait right here? 
  I have something that I really need to tell you. 
  I I just can't until I've had another conversation first. 
  Hey, Jo. 
  Merry Christmas, I guess? 
  You know what's weird about Christmas? 
  It's, um the happiest and the saddest. 
  Can we start with the happy? 
  And it's colder To turn on your side A person could not ask for a better partner, a better conscience. 
  You are literally the best person that's ever had the poor judgement to hang out with me. 
  We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow I love the way you laugh. 
  So don't ruin now And your upside down mouth. 
  The way your face looks when you watch movies and You're in love with Hope. 
  How we gonna move Together But that doesn't mean I regret a single second. 
  If we don't move Because you are beautiful. 
  Together And special. 
  And perfect. 
  How we gonna breathe How we gonna be Together And doing the right thing should never be this hard. 
  I thought leaving was the right thing to do. 
  But I was wrong. 
  That's what I came back to say. 
  I love you, Hope Mikaelson. 
  I-I loved you when I couldn't remember you. 
  I love you as I'm standing here right now. 
  Hope, I loved you when I was dead. 
  The tiniest thing I think I always will. 
  But we didn't get tonight We don't have tomorrow This is the part where you say That I love you, too Landon Kirby. 
  God, I loved you when you didn't even know it. 
  Despite the way you've looked in a football uniform. 
  (LAUGHING) 
  And let me say In the dark of the morning Then there's only one thing left to say. 
  Just one more thing Look up. 
  How we gonna move Together? 
  Just come closer If we don't move Together Just keeping the peace Just keeping the peace Don't worry, Dad. 
  I'll be home for Christmas. 
  Always preferred Halloween, meself.
