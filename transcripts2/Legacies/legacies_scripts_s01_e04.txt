 Previously on  Legacies...   
 You know, I opened this school to protect these kids.   
 How am I supposed to protect them from stuff that's not supposed to exist?   
 HOPE:  Landon was inside the walls of this school because of me.   
 He had access to the knife he stole because of me.   
 ALARIC:  Whoever wields it has the power to save the world,  or end all life as we know it.   
 A Neanderthal from Mystic Falls High assaulted me with a milkshake. 
- [GASPS, GROANS]    
 So let's do what we got to do here.    
 Then let's go back to school.    
 - They don't want me there. 
- I am not going without you.    
 All in.    
 - Kaleb, what are you doing? 
- Look, we homies, right?    
 And I ain't hurting anybody. Secret's ours?    
 - Why isn't she moving? 
- The statue hurt her.    
 [GROWLING]    
 DANA: Sasha, what are you doing?    
 [DISTANT FEMALE SCREAMING, THUDDING]    
 [SCREAMING]    
 [SCREAMING CONTINUES, LOW GROWLING]    
 [SCREAMING STOPS]    
 [PANTING]    
 [LOUD ROARING]    
 Come on, man. I'm the lovable virgin.    
 - [LOUD FOOTSTEPS] 
- It's not my time.    
 [ROARING]    
 I'm gonna open my eyes, and everything's gonna be fine.    
 - [LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
- Opening my eyes in three, two, one.

 Boo.    
 - Aah! 
- [LAUGHS]    
 - Come on, man. 
- Sorry, bruh. Too easy.    
 Oh. [SNIFFLES]    
 Where were you?    
 Just got a little peckish.    
 Went out for a midnight snack.    
 [CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES]    
 Oh.    
 We good?    
 - Yup. All good. 
- Good.    
 [LAUGHS AIRILY]    
 Night, then.    
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]    
 [SIGHS]    
 ALARIC:  Given our recent influx of monsters, Sheriff Donovan and I have decided we need to take drastic action.   
 Please give him your full attention.   
 Like Dr. Saltzman was saying, local girls Dana Lilien and Sasha Stoteraux didn't come home last night.    
 Dana sometimes skips town for a few days to party, but this is a first for Sasha.    
 ALARIC: Thank you, Sheriff Donovan.    
 Now while the knife is away with Dorian and things are quiet on his end, it won't hurt to assume the worst.    
 - If Dana and Sasha... 
- Dude, if you don't stop mugging me.    
 You heard Ol' Blue Eyes.    
 Dana has a history of running away.    
 I saw you feed on her.    
 Yeah, feed.    
 Not kidnap. MG, I'm telling you...    
 Vampire to vampire... This ain't on me.    
 Now, I'll need a few of you to volunteer to go to Mystic Falls High under the guise of an exchange program meant to improve relations between our schools, which, unfortunately, is 
necessary, given recent events.    
 Now, I give you permission to compel them, to gather materials form locator spells, because any information we can get will make all the difference.    
 Well, I guess that I can set aside my differences with Dana for a day, because that is what heroes do.    
 [ALARIC SIGHS]    
 So... I volunteer as tribute.    
 HOPE: She battles one gargoyle, and suddenly, she's Mother Teresa.    
 You're gonna be real embarrassed when I prove you wrong.    
 I'm in.    
 I'm in, too.    
 [STUDENTS MURMURING]    
 I'd like to help.    
 - [CLACKING] 
- ALARIC:  Who are you,  and what have you done with Hope Mikaelson?    
 [BOTH GRUNT]    
 I never got to go to a real school.    
 I've always wanted to know what it's like to be a normal for a day instead of being a tri-brid loner.     
 Yeah, well, that's a bed you made for yourself.     
 - Not looking for a social lecture. 
- [GRUNTING]     
 So, what's your plan with Landon?     
 Does he, like, go here now?     
 Why? You still thinking about murdering him?     
 [GRUNTING]     
 'Cause there's a knife that sat dormant for centuries that started attracting mythical creatures  the day he took possession of it. [GRUNTS]     
 I'd say there's a lot we need to learn about him.     
 [GRUNTING]     
 And then what? We kick him to the curb?     
 [GROANS, WINCES] Then we decide to do what's best for the people of this school. 
- Any idea what to do with him while we search for missing mean girls?     
 As a matter of fact, yes.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Did they say anything about me?     
 No, not yet.     
 Everybody's been talking about some missing girls from your old high school.     
 Well, do you think they're gonna kick me out?     
 They gave you some clothes.     
 - I think that's a good sign. 
- From     .     
 Come on, man. We have both been places where nobody has wanted us before.     
 - You know the drill. 
- Yeah. Keep my head down, make myself useful, don't pick fights. 
- Exactly.     
 We need today to go well, Ian.     
 No, we need this to go perfect.     
 Otherwise, I'm as good as gone.     
 Landon. You have a minute?     
 I think you might be of some use today.

- Sorry. Sorry.     
 [LAUGHING]     
 I was making an entrance, mophead.     
 Sorry. I just had a... a flashback to my freshman year here.     
 Girls are missing, so get your wedgie trauma in check or leave.     
 He's fine now. Let it go.     
 LIZZIE: Okay, here's the deal.     
 Landon, you talk to any of the people you still know from when you went here.     
 Hope, you try to not deliberately alienate the entire student body while the rest of us save the world.     
 - This isn't a contest, Lizzie. 
- You're right.     
 It's a mission for a hero and her league of...     
 - whatevers. 
- KALEB: Yeah.     
 Screw that. I work alone.     
 MG, I need your compulsion skills.     
 Would you like to be the Robin to my Batwoman?     
 Actually, Batwoman doesn't have a Robin.     
 - She... 
- Metaphor, nerd. Let's go.     
 [LOUD CROWD CHATTER, UTENSILS CLINKING]     
 [SIGHS]     
 You know, the wolves usually eat outside.     
 I'd rather hang with you.     
 I didn't see you at the assembly.     
 Kind of still figuring my way around this place.     
 Why didn't you ditch like Landon and go play detective?     
 Well, I'm actually working on offensive spells for class.     
 They only teach defensive magic here, but I personally think that the curriculum needs to evolve.     
 What?     
 Oh, nothing.     
 What?     
 I'm still trying to wrap my head around this being a normal conversation here.     
 - [BOTH LAUGHS] 
- Got it. So...     
 Meaning you're happy to be back?     
 I'll be happy when I know that Landon can stay.     
 And then, what if he can't?     
 Bounce, witch. Rafael and I need to have a little chat.     
 Soon as Josie and I are done.     
 Actually, newb, I'm your alpha.     
 You're done when I say you're done.     
 Well, would you look at the time.     
 As fun as this hurricane of toxic masculinity is, I have to get to class.     
 I'll walk you.     
 [CHATTER, WHOOPING]     
 This is the senior hallway, where I spent much of my formative years stuffed in every locker... except this one.     
 That one doesn't open. On your left, you'll find the bathroom.     
 It's where I had my first kiss with a toilet.     
 I'm sorry. Is the fact that I'm not openly hostile to you make it seem like we're back to being friends?     
 Uh, sorry. Just, I was going for effortlessly natural.     
 But this is all just making me really nervous.     
 Like, the school and seeing Connor and being with you...     
 Shouldn't you be talking to anyone you know?     
 That's easier said than done.     
 There is no way Dana's clique is talking to me unless you have a spell that will make me retroactively cool.     
 Well, I'll talk to them, then.     
 It's even worse for you. Trust me.     
 You have no idea how human high schools work.     
 You're the new girl. Might as well be radioactive. 
- GIRL: I'm sorry.     
 You look traumatized. Is this loser bothering you?     
 He keeps trying to get me to buy his mix tape.     
 [SCOFFS] Gross.     
 Well, we're going to lunch. You hungry?     
 Famished.     
 Jogger called it in.     
 Yeah, the plates match.     
 It's Dana's car.     
 Think it's safe to say she's not a runaway.     
 You said the creatures were after a knife that you had sent far away. 
- ALARIC: They are.     
 And I did.     
 This doesn't make any sense.     
 Ah, damn it.     
 Actually, it's starting to make perfect sense.     
 What is it?     
 A vampire bite.     
 Nice form. You're one of Dana's friends, right?     
 Jill, and my friendship with Dana doesn't define me.     
 That was a joke.     
 Of course it does.     
 [CHUCKLES] Cool, cool.     
 Tell me where Dana and Sasha are and we'll get out of your hair.     
 More like split ends.     
 Shut up, Saltzman. And why are you all up in their business?     
 Are all of you private school kids this creepy?     
 - Uh. 
- [WHISTLE BLOWS]     
 COACH: Okay, that's it. Hit the showers.     
 Compulsion fail.     
 Hope's probably doing a victory lap by now.     
 What's with the performance anxiety?     
 I think you're distracting me.     
 I'm wearing polyester.     
 And you're totally pulling it off.     
 [SIGHS] Get your head in the game, MG.     
 [PHONE RINGS]     
 You have the school phone?     
 Where were you keeping it?     
 It's your dad. He trusts me.     
 You smell like gummy bears.     
 Answer it.     
 Okay.     
 Hello?     
 I need to talk to everyone.     
 - We split up. 
- ALARIC [ON PHONE]: Lizzie.     
 I told you to work together.     
 LIZZIE: In order to conquer, we had to divide, Daddy.     
 So looks like you're gonna have to trust your own gene pool for once.     
 Sorry to disappoint.     
 Look, I'm about to tell you three things, all equally horrifying, so I need you to keep your cool.     
 Can you both do that?     
 Of course, no problem.     
 Okay. One: Dana is dead.     
 Two: A vampire killed her.     
 Three: I just told the sheriff that we had nothing to do with it so I need to know right now that I am right.     
 Have either of you heard anything about the vampires at our school feeding?     
 - No. 
- Nah.     
 We're not supposed to, everyone knows that.     
 ALARIC: Okay. Good.     
 I'll call you back when I know more.     
 And I expect you to be with Hope when I do.     
 - [PHONE BEEPS OFF] 
- [SIGHS]     
 You are a horrible liar.     
 Spill.     
 [CHATTERING]     
 - [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] 
- Hey.     
 Let me guess.     
 Pigtails spilled her guts and confessed to kidnapping Dana and Sasha. Case closed.     
 Her name's Cheryl, and not exactly.     
 But she did invite me to try out for the cheerleading team.     
 Who are you right now?     
 And what is that thing on your head?     
 It's a gift... from Cheryl.     
 You're better than this, Hope.     
 Relax, Eeyore.     
 Dana gave it to her.     
 It's potential locator spell material.     
 Plus, even though Sasha and Connor are dating, Dana was sleeping with him behind her back. 
- Yeah, some clue.     
 Everyone at this school knows Connor's a dick.     
 Come on, Landon.     
 Adultery, missing girls...     
 It's like every TV show that old people watch.     
 A "crime of passion," I think they call it.     
 I know Connor.     
 He's made my life a living hell, but he's not a killer. Trust me.     
 Trusting you is what got us into this mess in the first place.     
 Look. There he is.     
 So do you want to play good cop or bad cop?     
 Because I don't think "emo cop" is a thing.     
 Oh, very funny.     
 But while you were off making friends I did some sleuthing of my own.     
 Scarf in Virginia heat?     
 Sounds like a lead, I think they call it.     
 MATT: They're vampire bites, Ric.     
 If they said they didn't do it, they didn't do it. End of story.     
 No, actually, it's just the beginning, because now I have to put a   -year-old girl in this body bag, then lie to her parents about what actually killed her.     
 Or maybe you forgot what it's like to be on this side of that conversation.     
 It's not about sides.     
 Oh, yeah? Tell that to Dana.     
 I thought you said we were gonna have lunch.     
 Yeah. Well, uh, one of us is.

 LIZZIE: Great.     
 Hope's already here.     
 Thought we were cool, bruh.     
 Don't "bruh" him.     
 Second place or not, we know you killed Dana.     
 Wait. Dana's dead?     
 Dr. Saltzman said they found her dead from a vampire bite.     
 I didn't kill her, so y'all need to get the hell outta my face.     
 - [SCREAMS] 
- Come on, guys, let's go.     
 It's hero time.     
 To the Blondemobile.     
 [GROANS]     
 Not so fast, Kaleb.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 I told you, all I did was feed.     
 Torture me all you want to, but my answer's gonna remain the same... because I didn't kill Dana.     
 Uh, he's right.     
 What, so you're a mind reader now, Landon?     
 Call it a hunch.     
 DANA: We were on the way to graffiti that mill at your school.     
 It was a harmless prank.     
 But then I got snatched.     
 Next thing I remember, I woke up in a ditch.     
 So enjoy it while you can, Lizzie.     
 I'm sure I look like crap.     
 Oh, my God.     
 What is that?     
 It's...     
 Someone help me out here.     
 It's the mother of all hickeys.     
 You're fine, Dana.     
 You're just a-a little slutty.     
 [SCOFFS] I don't even like any of you.     
 I should be talking to the cops.     
 - I can't let you do that. 
-  Ad somnum.   
 I mean, she can't let you do that.     
 So you didn't kill her. 
You freaking turned her?     
 Turned her?     
 You think I want to sit and listen to that for all eternity?     
 Well, someone did, meaning that we have a transitioning vampire on our hands.     
 So what are we gonna do with her?     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 Foster kid. I've been looking for you.     
 I'll catch up with you later.     
 I got to get to class.     
 Look, uh, Jed, right?     
 [CHUCKLES] I don't want any problems.     
 Neither do we.     
 We just want to initiate you into the pack.     
 Okay. The process is simple.     
 You triggered your werewolf curse this month, which means you killed somebody recently.     
 Maybe on purpose, maybe not.     
 All you gotta do is tell us the story.     
 That's our rite of passage.     
 Yeah, I'm not really a pack kinda guy.     
 You still don't get it, do you?     
 You don't have a choice.     
 You can either submit or you can bleed and then submit.     
 It's your call.     
 [GRUNTING]     
 [GRUNTING]     
 Hey.     
 I said, hey!     
 [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING]     
 [GROANING]     
 [RINGING FADES]     
 [COUGHS]     
 To be continued.     
 - Hey, are you okay? 
- Get off of me!     
 Just stay away from me.     
 So let me get this straight.     
 Dana died with vampire blood in her system so she came back to life and now she's in transition, and she needs to feed or die?     
 Nailed it, bro. Easy decision, right?     
 - Huh. 
- KALEB: All right, so... we give her human blood, it's that simple.     
 HOPE: Not everyone wants to be supernatural.     
 Some people just want to be normal.     
 Dana's traumatized, you guys. This is a huge decision.     
 Maybe we should give her a day or two.     
 She'll be dead in a day if she doesn't feed.     
 Oops.     
 I suck at math.     
 You should tell her the truth.     
 My guess is that she'd be psyched to be at a place like your school... I know I would.     
 You're awful quiet over there, MG.     
 I'm a feminist, bruh. 
I'm not gonna tell Dana what to do with her body.     
 Landon's right.     
 Ugh, fine.     
 Okay, but to be clear, she is not joining drill team.     
 Surgere.   
 [DANA GROANS]     
 Did I pass out?     
 I don't feel so well.     
 We know how you feel.     
 And it's okay, you're just hungry.     
 Anorexia was sophomore year.     
 This is something else.     
 You'll feel better after you feed. I promise.     
 Oh, shut up. For real.     
 Even thinking about eating makes me want to...     
 [COUGHING]     
 Oh, damn. What'd that girl eat?     
 I think her soul just got on my shoes. Ew.     
 I think I'm-a be sick, too.     
 Is this normal?     
 She's puking her guts out.     
 Literally.     
 Dana. Dana!     
 Should we call your dad?     
 Why? So he can take another bullet for you?     
 No.     
 Because whatever did this is not a vampire.     
 It's got to be another monster from the knife.     
 Well, maybe the monster's been right in front of us all along.     
 What...?     
 Are you serious?     
 Hey, none of this started happening until you showed up and stole that knife, which is exactly     
 what the other monsters came here to do.     
 - You saying it's a coincidence? 
- Yeah.     
 Yeah. Yes, I am.     
 You believe me, right?     
 Got it.     
 Say no more.     
 [RAFAEL SHOUTING]     
 - Raf. Raf. 
- I told you to leave me alone!     
 No, I can't do that until you... 
No, just calm down!     
 - It's not safe! Get away! 
- Calm down.     
 Close your eyes and breathe.     
 Breathe.

 That's more like it.     
 Was that magic?     
 No. Just...     
 years of practice with Lizzie, I guess.     
 - I didn't mean to scare you. 
- No.     
 You can't scare me. Hey.     
 Hey.     
 What scares me is that you're dead if you don't submit.     
 - [SIGHS] 
- Hey, no, it's just the way it is.     
 You're the one talking about making change, right?     
 I meant adding an elective, not launching a revolution.     
 - Josie... 
- Jed's an alpha, okay?     
 You're a wolf. Okay? That's just the way it is. There's no other way. 
- Josie.     
 [INSECTS TRILLING]

 All right, come on. 
Let's get this over with.     
 What's it gonna be? Toilet bowl?     
 Trash can?     
 Bloody nose?     
 Say something, you dick.     
 No, you made my life miserable.     
 You don't get to pretend I don't exist.     
 [TRILLING]     
 [SNARLING]     
 [HOSE SPRAYING]     
 Nasty. Yeah, so, um, I'm out of here.     
 But little piece of advice...     
 Landon could be in there right now eating fools.     
 So, I'll holla.     
 [SIGHS] Come on, guys.     
 If it's not Landon, then what else could it be?     
 Spider.     
 A big spider. An Arachne, if you want to get specific.     
 This is nerd p0rn, not real life.     
 So were dragons and gargoyles.     
 The writer bases her comics off of Greek lore.     
 An Arachne was originally a beautiful woman who was cursed by a jealous god  and turned into a giant spider.     
 Uh, all it wants is to be human, so it wears the skin of its prey to pass.     
 [CHUCKLES]: Oh, my God. Its-its fangs are huge, so they could pass for a vampire bite.     
 And its bite liquefies its victims!     
 Plus, I found a web in Dana's hair.     
 That would explain why it couldn't follow the knife out of town.     
 An SUV-sized insect can't exactly hitchhike unless it inhabits the body of someone.     
 - Who? Sasha maybe? 
- My money is still on your boyfriend.     
 - He's not my boyfriend. 
- If we had something from it, we could do a tracking spell.     
 Would its face work?     
 [GRUNTS] This is bad. 
Whatever spun this, it's gonna come back and it's gonna eat us.     
 Can't you witch us out of here?     
 No, that's not how my powers work.     
 My sister and I, we come from this specific witch bloodline called the Gemini Coven.     
 Basically, we don't have powers of our own.     
 We have to siphon them from other things first.     
 So, that thing that you did earlier, you siphoned power from a wall?     
 There's magic that runs through the school.     
 It works on small spells.     
 Okay, can you siphon a wolf?     
 I mean, theoretically, yeah, but my hands are stuck.     
 Unless...     
 That was unexpected.     
 Sorry.     
 Don't be.     
 Uh, did it work?     
 I don't know. The room's still spinning.     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 
 
 
 RAFAEL: Hey!     
 Hey, we're trapped up here!     
 JOSIE: Connor?     
 [SNARLING]     
 Damn.     
 Whoa.     
 He's coming.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Josie, now would be a good time for one of those offensive magic spells you were talking about.     
 Ignarious.   
 [THUD]     
 [EXHALES] All right, I think you got him.     
 Or we just pissed him off.     
 [SCREECHING]     
 - [PHONE RINGING] 
- It's for you.     
 No way I'm telling your dad what we're about to do.     
 I suck at lying.     
 You're great at it.     
 You're his favorite.     
 You're the hero.     
 Hi, Daddy!     
 Hey, thought I'd call, check in, see how things are going.     
 So good.     
 Really? Define "good," Lizzie, because I don't think that involves me tracking down Dana's body to the glove compartment.     
 Listen, Dad, it's fine. 
We cracked the case.     
 It's a spider.     
 But, like, a big, huge, nasty spider.     
 And MG's comic books know how to kill it.     
 Comic books? Really? 
Lizzie, listen to me, whatever you're thinking of doing, don't, okay?     
 So just tell me where you are, and Matt and I will be right there.     
 And where is Hope?     
 I'm sorry, Dad.     
 You're gonna have to trust me for once.     
 [BEEP]     
 Let's do this.     
 I think he's still out there.     
 [SCREECHING]     
 [JOSIE SCREAMING]     
 [SNARLING]     
 Hey! Douchebag!     
 - [SCREECHING] 
- Oh.     
 I hate spiders.     
 - You need to get us out of here. 
- Crap.     
 Uanascar.   
 HOPE: Lizzie, I need your help! Josie. Take my hand.     
 [HISSING]     
 Repeat after me.     
 Imperium fluctus malleus.   
 [SCREECHING]     
 Imperium fluctus malleus.   
 Imperium fluctus malleus.   
 Imperium fluctus malleus.   
 Imperium fluctus malleus.   
 - [SCREECHING] 
-  Imperium fluctus malleus!

 - Was she bitten? 
- No.     
 You're gonna be fine. There was a party in the woods.     
 You and Dana had the time of your lives.     
 But on the way home, you guys were attacked by a mountain lion.     
 You survived and Dana didn't.     
 There was nothing you could do.     
 Dana's dead?     
 LIZZIE: Just take it all away.     
 Tell her not to feel anything.     
 You can't compel her not to grieve.     
 I'm helping her.     
 Tell her that it's gonna hurt.     
 It always will. Tell her that some days will be harder than others... but eventually she'll remember the good times she had with Dana, too.     
 Tell her to hold on to those, because it's the key to getting through this.     
 [BALL THUDDING]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Are you sure that you want to do this?     
 You saw what they did to me.     
 I don't think going lone wolf's an option anymore.     
 - Do you? 
- Don't look at me.     
 I'm a twin. I don't do anything solo.     
 Look, after Cassie died, I thought Landon was the only pack that I'd ever have.     
 I didn't think that I needed anyone else.     
 Be honest with me.     
 Is this school, these people...     
 keeping Landon here... Is it worth it?     
 This place is flawed.     
 Every single person here is cursed in some way, whether it's blood or just life.     
 Everyone has issues of their own that they're dealing with.     
 But we're all in this together.     
 Every single person here, we look out for each other.     
 So, yeah.     
 It's worth it.     
 Little help?     
 Medicine ball.     
 Jed and his boys play for keeps.     
 Foster kid.     
 You back for more?     
 I killed my girlfriend.     
 It was an accident.     
 I was behind the wheel, and I lost control.     
 When I woke up, I was in the hospital.     
 Landon had to tell me that she was dead, and I don't know anything else.     
 Am I a part of the pack now?     
 Take a knee.     
 What?     
 You're gonna submit to your alpha, you take a knee.     
 No, I'm just playing.     
 It's your ball.     
 - Do this, Rafael. 
- You're in the next round.     
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]     
 So much for my plan to spend the day as a normal teenage girl.     
 Did good back there.     
 Yeah.     
 Felt nice to be part of the team... until you all accused me of being a monster.     
 I'm sorry.     
 It's just gonna take us some time before we can trust you again. 
- Yeah.     
 I got that. Repeatedly.     
 So let me lay this out for you all at once.     
 I don't know why I was drawn to that knife any more than I can explain why a supersized spider inhabited the body of a kid who used to bully me in high school.     
 I don't know why creatures we've only read about in books are making cameos in Mystic Falls.     
 I don't have an explanation for any of this.     
 And let's be honest, neither do any of you.     
 So as far as I can see, we're supposed to be in this together.     
 And this morning, all I wanted to be  was sitting here. Part of all of this.     
 Spending time with you.     
 But all day long you ridiculed me, and then you hung me out to dry.     
 When it mattered.     
 You wanted to know what it's like to be normal?     
 Congrats, Hope.     
 You're officially normal.     
 ALARIC:  I specifically asked you to wait.   
 - I know, but... 
- No buts.     
 There are no buts, Lizzie.     
 Okay, being a hero is not more important than being safe.     
 I'm not a hero, Dad.     
 The only reason I was trying to be is because that's how you're always treating Hope.     
 Let's be honest.     
 She's better at it than I'll ever be.     
 Hope is not the goal.     
 Hope is a cautionary tale.     
 And the reasons I trust her are the last things I'd ever want the two of you to experience.     
 That's why I founded this school.     
 That's why there are rules.     
 Well, the only reason why we're alive today is because we broke the rules.     
 Today Hope did a spell that saved us, a spell that we would have known if the school taught us offensive magic.     
 And then Lizzie almost died yesterday because you didn't tell us to be on the lookout for monsters.     
 The past couple of days have proven that you cannot protect us from everything.     
 We have to start learning how to protect ourselves.     
 Oh, God.     
 Is this that moment they talk about when parents lose all control?     
 - Dad. 
- Dad.     
 [SIGHS] All right, I will take it under consideration.     
 Okay?     
 Now... go to bed.     
 I love you.     
 Sort of.     
 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
- Where did that come from?     
 I guess I felt like launching the revolution.     
 You sold me out!     
 Yeah, I know.     
 Lizzie caught me lying,     
 - and I-I just crumbled. 
- What?     
 Dude, you got to know 
who you stand with.     
 And it can't be with some girl who thinks she's too good to give you the time of day.     
 Vamps before tramps, remember?     
 Yeah.     
 [INHALES SHARPLY]     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 N-No.     
 Look, I appreciate the rhyme, but don't disrespect her like that.     
 We got enough monsters out here as it is.     
 We cannot become one of them.     
 [SCOFFS] You're a puppet, MG.     
 The headmaster     
 and his daughter's little puppet.     
 - No, I'm not. 
- No?     
 Then it doesn't bother you that she bosses you around and you just take it, right?     
 I mean, he makes you run all his errands, and you just take it.     
 Even today. They couldn't even let the vamps out on our own.     
 They had to send the witches to keep an eye on us.     
 Hell, they even make rules about how we're supposed to eat, but they don't tell us what they're actually feeding us.     
 There's blood bags in that refrigerator right there.     
 But not human blood!     
 What are you talking about?     
 [SCOFFS]     
 You know what, man?     
 Ask yourself why you don't see many rabbits running around the yard around here.     
 Evening, Officer. Let me guess, you're here to give me a medal.     
 Actually, I'm here to ask you a few questions.     
 - About what? 
- About why half     
 the Mystic Falls cheerleading squad's wearing scarves around their necks.     
 ALARIC: Walk away, Matt.     
 I'll handle this.     
 Oh, don't pretend like you on my side when you the one who told him.     
 Question is: who told you?     
 Lizzie? MG?     
 Actually, you just did.     
 I've had my suspicions, but I could never confirm them.     
 So... what are you gonna do about it?     
 'Cause I know you ain't locking me up.     
 I've been doing this too long, Ric.     
 If your kids are a threat, I'll be coming for them.     
 If you threaten my kids, Sheriff, I'll be the one coming for you.     
 Yeah, well, I know why it's quiet on your end.     
 We had a visit from an ancient body-snatching spider today.   
 Wow, that's an... interesting development.     
 [WOOD SMASHING]     
 Hang on a sec.     
 Listen, why don't you come home?     
 We were wrong.     
 Nothing's coming your way.     
 [SNARLING]     
 Hold that thought.
