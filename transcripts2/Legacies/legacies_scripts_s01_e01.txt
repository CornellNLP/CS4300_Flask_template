 My name is Hope Mikaelson.   
 I come from a long line of the villains in the tales you've heard about vampires, werewolves, witches, and everything in between.   
 The school behind these gates protects the secrets of people like me.

 LIZZIE:  Welcome to The Salvatore School.   
 We're your tour guides.

 - Twins. 
- Fraternal. Obvs.

 [SIGHS] So... let's get started.     
 [LAUGHTER AND INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 I'm curious, Landon... Slow down...     
 Were you aware of us when you lived in Mystic Falls?     
 Uh, I knew Hope went to some fancy boarding school.     
 People in town said it was for troubled rich kids.     
 I see the rich part is true.     
 Nobody in town mentioned anyone in here could do that.     
 No one in Mystic Falls knows much about us.     
 We blend in just enough.     
 Participate, contribute just enough.     
 Keeps people from asking too many questions.     
 What is there to know, exactly?     
 Well, I used to have a speech prepared, carefully unpeeling the layers of mystical history, but it turns out most people have read  Harry Potter  and are actually cool with 
me skipping the tee-up.     
 You're a school for magic?     
 We are a school for the supernatural, which covers a lot of territory.     
 Everyone here has something that makes them special in ways that the outside world... wouldn't understand.     
 So, what are you?     
 - I should get to class. 
- No.     
 No. Sorry.     
 I don't mean to be a dick, but I don't know you, and though the image of you whammying a priest is still fresh, I need you here.     
 [SIGHS] Just tell me what all that was in the church last night?     
 What do you think it was?     
 Well, as best as I can reason, either I've lost my mind or werewolves are real.     
 Th-This is beyond insane.     
 How is that even possible?     
 It's a long story, involving an ancient, vengeful witch and a bloodline curse.     
 We cover all that in Origins of the Species, grade six. 
- In sixth grade at my school, we learned the state capitals.     
 [LAUGHS] We teach that, too.     
 I have some questions about Rafael.     
 Like what?     
 Well, let's start with who he killed recently.     
 Everybody gets along with everybody here, for the most part.     
 The wolves are pretty cliquey.     
 They like to hang with their own.     
 In defiance of the school's commitment to inclusiveness.     
 That is why we volunteered to be your tour guides.     
 To give you a good witch welcome before your hairier brethren corrupt you.     
 That is our librarian, Mr. Williams.     
 He's subbing for our Chemistry of Magic teacher who accidentally incinerated himself last week in hellfire. 
- Burned all the hair off his body, but didn't leave a scar.     
 Allright.     
 Now, this language has been carefully crafted over centuries.     
 So you may think you can play fast and loose with the syllables, but you'd be very wrong about that.     
 Because otherwise, a love charm becomes a what?     
 Penelope, show us.     
 LIZZIE: She who shall not be named. 
- Talking about her gives her power.     
 RAFAEL: Who are you talking about?     
 Josie's evil ex.     
 Phesmatos is lucas odoray.   
 [COUGHING]     
 DORIAN: That's right...     
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- ...a stink spell.     
 - Yes. 
- [GROANS]     
 Come on. We'll show you the turret.     
 It's where the seniors go to smoke.     
 What do they smoke, eye of newt?     
 Weed.     
 - Why would you ask me that? 
- The werewolf gene lies dormant until the carrier takes a human life.     
 If Rafael triggered his curse, it's... because he killed someone.     
 And we don't accept coldblooded killers into our program. 
- He's not a killer.     
 We're not trying...     
 He's not... a killer.     
 Well, I know a little bit about his background.     
 Neglectful birth parents.     
 Orphaned in adolescence.     
 Six foster homes in seven years.     
 - Prone to fits of anger. 
- Yeah, you could just as easily be reading  my  file... 
That's what it's like out there for people like him and me.     
 Landon, I know this is a lot to take in right now, but we're only trying to help.     
 I've been going here since I was seven.     
 This is a safe place for people like Rafael.     
 It's a home.     
 ALARIC: But... if we take him in, we need to make sure that he is not a threat.     
 LANDON: His girlfriend...     
 [SIGHS] Cassie.     
 Last month... he was driving, there was a storm, he took a turn too fast.     
 And then he started acting out.     
 At first I thought it was just grief.     
 And then maybe... maybe drugs or something.     
 And then he threw a   -pound lawnmower    feet across the yard.     
 That was when our foster parents called in the priest.     
 I guess they thought he was possessed by the devil.     
 All of that is... consistent with a newly triggered wolf.     
 It's normal.     
 Thank you for that, Landon.     
 Oh.     
 Everything's gonna be okay.     
 I promise.     
 We're ready.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Landon Kirby, Milton Greasley.     
 - Come on, Dr. Saltzman. 
- ALARIC: Right. MG.     
 I'm sorry. Take it from a guy named Alaric.     
 I get it. Landon, MG is my student aide.     
 He's also a vampire.     
 Of course he is.     
 You know, for a school with a secret to keep, you're kind of liberal with your information.     
 Well, we don't actually intend for you to remember any of it.     
 Forget everything you've seen or learned since last night.     
 All you need to know is that your friend has found a home where he can live a better life. You'll miss him.     
 But you know it's for the best.     
 Are you two out of your minds?     
 How could I forget any of this?     
 - MG, did you do it wrong? 
- No, I didn't do it wrong.     
 It's the easiest vampire trick in the book.     
 - Well, it didn't work. 
- Obviously, it didn't work.     
 Careful.     
 Get him to the cellar.     
 This is not good. This is bad.     
 [BIRDS SINGING]     
 [BREATHING SHAKILY]     
 WOMAN:  No!   
 - MAN:  Let me... 
- WOMAN:  No!   
 You sit here and think about it.     
 Please, don't lock me in here!     
 Please!   
 - HOPE: Landon. 
- Hope.     
 Can you get me out of here?     
 Not yet. But you're not a prisoner here, I swear.     
 I'm in a witch dungeon.     
 It's a werewolf transition space.     
 Super.     
 I'm not so good with, you know...     
 - small spaces. 
- We won't keep you here long.     
 No one expected you couldn't be compelled.     
 I don't know what that means.     
 MG tried to erase your memories of this place, but it didn't work. 
- [CHUCKLES]     
 So now what, I'm a hostage? Where's Rafi?     
 He's fine. You're fine, too.     
 Look, compulsion doesn't work on people who take this herb called vervain.     
 The town sheriff sometimes slips it into the coffee at the gas station we were at this morning.     
 It takes about a day to pass through your system, but you just have to wait it out.     
 [EXHALES] Sure.     
 Yeah, no big deal.     
 Yeah, I'll just sit here alone in the witch dungeon with my thoughts.     
 Would you...     
 I mean... could you wait it out with me?     
 I'm really sorry about all of this.     
 But it was nice to see you again.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Whoa, move!

 Alyssa Chang made a broom fly in physics last year, but Rick Rogers fell   feet during practice, so real-life Quidditch remains an elusive pipe dream.     
 It's called Wickery.     
 My parents invented it when we were ten.     
 Their version is a little less violent than ours.     
 Yo.     
 Giving up dibs on the new guy so quickly?     
 It's not a competition.     
 Plus, I'm still nursing a wounded soul.     
 Hmm. Penelope Park.     
 We don't mention her name anymore, remember?     
 [CHUCKLES] Sorry.     
 [CROWD CHEERING]     
 Do you think he'll go for her?     
 Probably. They usually do.     
 Okay.     
 I heard about what happened to your girlfriend.     
 Oh, I have spies everywhere.     
 I'm nosy in that, like, charming way.     
 Thanks, I guess.     
 On the plus side, we're all happy to know that you're single.     
 Oh, God.     
 That was my inside voice.     
 I am so sorry.     
 Guys like you make me nervous.     
 - Guys like me? 
- You know.     
 Hot.     
 Angry.     
 Damaged.     
 Yeah, well, I sort of made a point in my life of, uh, keeping clear of girls like you.     
 So I guess I'm gonna go find Landon.     
 [WHISTLE BLOWS, CROWD CHEERS]     
 You didn't have to lock him in the cellar.     
 Where else was I gonna put him?     
 - Block with your hand. 
- I got it.     
 If you had it, I wouldn't have to say it.     
 Dimiterre.   
 [PANTING] Cheater.     
 You should really let a vampire start doing my training.     
 You're getting a little old for me to break your human bones.     
 How dare you?     
 You and Landon have a thing or something?     
 - I don't have things. 
- Yes, I'm well aware of your quest to avoid all emotional intimacy.     
 There was obviously something.     
 I liked him.     
 He's normal.     
 Well, let's keep him that way.     
 We survive here because we follow the rules.     
 We can't get sloppy about it.     
 You're the one that's always telling me     
 I need to get out more. [CHUCKLES]     
 I tell you that you need to stop locking yourself in your dorm room binge-watching  Cutthroat Kitchen.   
 I don't tell you to go out and fraternize with the human locals.     
 You know, you can just be my headmaster.     
 All this other stuff isn't in the job description.     
 Attempt to make an actual friend here, and we could reevaluate this relationship.

 Okay, well, for one, we're not supposed to.     
 For two, last I checked, you were more into girls, and for three...     
 No one asked you to bring math into this conversation.     
 You know what I mean.     
 For one, rules are meant to be broken.     
 For two, I am an equal opportunity evil temptress, and your binary assumptions about sexuality... they're dated.

 I know it seems cruel, but please understand, this school was created so we could shape the minds of young supernatural beings, protect their secret, and then send them out into the human world fully equipped to handle it.     
 We are here to prevent these great kids from indulging in their darkest impulses.     
 Make no mistake, these are predatory creatures.     
 Vampires are driven by the feed and the kill.     
 Wolves can't control themselves in their primal state.     
 And witches... [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]     
 ...witches, when provoked, are responsible for some of the worst atrocities in history.

 After years of pushing people away, I opened my heart to Landon Kirby, the human in the wrong place at the right time who just needed a place to belong.

 But when I hunt him down, I'm gonna be the villain of his.
