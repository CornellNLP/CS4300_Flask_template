 -  Previously on  Legacies... 
- We need to learn more   
 -  about Landon's past. 
- Who are your parents?   
 My mom's name is Seylah. 
Pretty much all I know.   
 She gave me up for adoption when I was young.   
 - I don't even know your name. 
- Landon.   
 That's a beautiful one.   
 Pretty sure you gave it to me.   
 CLARKE:  What happened here?   
 MAN:  Unscheduled absorption.   
 Any idea who it was?    
 Of course not, but I did find this.    
 What I don't understand is why I can't remember how we found you.    
 Do you want to be my boyfriend?    
 What brought this on?    
 I'm really happy that you're back.    
 I can lie to Landon about all of this, but I'm sorry.    
 Dr. Saltzman, I just can't lie to you.    
 I take it that's the urn I don't remember.    
 I figured it was better to have it here    
 than to leave it laying around.    
 So what happens now?    
 I think we're about to find out.    
 No record of any employee named Seylah.    
 You sure she worked here?    
 I can't think of any other reason    
 she'd have our logo around her neck.    
 I need access to the backup archive.    
 Access requires a password only granted to employees    
 with the highest level security clearance.    
 Takes longer than a couple months here    
 to work up to that, young buck.

 SECURITY GUARD: You all right back there?    
 Find what you're looking for?    
 No. I guess I was wrong.

 CHILD  : Go to sleep, Pedro.    
 How long do you think it'll be    
 before the next monster shows up?    
 It's hard to say.    
 I've never actually seen an artifact glow before.    
 Where did you hide the urn, by the way?    
 - I'm not sure I should tell you. 
- Excuse me?    
 Isn't it safer if only one of us knows where it is?    
 Then that one of us should be the adult.    
 Funny, because I thought it should be the one of us    
 with high-level superpowers.    
 What do we tell everyone else?    
 We should probably warn them    
 before a cyclops crashes exam week.    
 It's usually best to start    
 with some form of the truth.    
 What about those times the truth is the one thing you can't say?    
 Are you sure you want to keep all of this from Landon?    
 I mean, I understand you wanting to protect him, but...    
 He's been wondering about his mother his whole life.    
 He finally meets her and then she dies.    
 If I can keep him from knowing    
 what that feels like, then it's worth it.    
 [SIGHS] Look, it's my secret to keep, Dr. Saltzman.    
 - Please. 
- Okay.    
 Thank you.    
 The trick is to give everyone the right amount    
 of information without giving away too much.    
 We've been through this before with the knife,    
 so it shouldn't come as too much of a shock.    
 This is our chance to do things differently,    
 more responsibly.    
 Yesterday, I came into possession   
 of another Malivore artifact.    
 It was my hope to find a method of containment    
 before it signaled another monster,    
 but given the emergency meeting    
 I've just called, I'm sure you can guess how well that went.    
 - [STUDENTS MURMURING] 
- Do you see Hope anywhere?    
 ALARIC: But rest assured we are taking every precaution.    
 Sheriff Donovan has been kind enough    
 to open the doors of the Lockwood Mansion to us,    
 so Mr. Williams and Ms. Tig are now in the process    
 of evacuating our students from the lower grades.    
 Why don't we just evacuate the damn artifact?    
 We are much more well-equipped    
 than the world at large to handle the arrival of a monster.    
 Once we know what we're dealing with     
 and the problem is contained,     
 then we can reassess what to do with the artifact.     
 If any of you would like to evacuate,     
 please talk to Dorian or Emma. However,     
 exam week will continue as scheduled,     
 wherever you are. I know. I'm sorry.     
 I can't exactly call the state accreditation board     
 and tell them that we're cancelling the exams     
 because of monsters.     
 We'll get through this, I promise.     
 Try and get some rest, okay?     
 Good night.

 bringing me back here 'cause where I go, danger follows.

 Come on, bro. Now, this one's not on you.     
 I mean, her being distant today has got to have something to do     
 with us waking up in a field with amnesia yesterday, right?     
 Look, until one of you     
 can remembers how you guys got there, I just...     
 I-I just wouldn't think about it.

 ALARIC: This happened to you in a nightmare?     
 Are you sure?     
 Look, I know that it sounds crazy,     
 but I was studying and then I fell asleep,     
 and then I just started dreaming about...     
 About what?     
 Um...     
 Um...     
 One of my old, uh, foster dads.     
 He was in the library, and he had this old belt     
 that he used to use on me.     
 Do you remember anything else?     
 Yeah, there was, there was this woman there, too.     
 She was wearing an-an old,     
 black dress and-and a veil.     
 And she told me, "You know what I want." But...     
 The urn.     
 Sounds like our next monster showed up.     
 You know, every culture on Earth has legends about creatures     
 that only appear in dreams.     
 But a woman in a black dress and a veil is pretty specific.     
 So, does that mean that she can, like,     
 control what we see in our dreams?     
 That she can put stuff in our, in our heads, right?     
 It's possible.     
 Does that look familiar?     
 Our latest monster is a Night Hag,     
 a malevolent spirit trapped on the astral plane     
 that can only interact with us through dreams.     
 In this case, nightmares.     
 So, like Freddy Krueger?     
 Well, in the sense that what happens to you in your dreams     
 seems to also happen to you in real life, yes.     
 But the good news is we're safe, so long as we stay awake.

 I've lined up more evacuation shuttles.     
 They should be running all afternoon,

 take advantage of them.     
 All right, that's all.

 LANDON: What about you?     
 You had any bad dreams last night?     
 No. I-I barely slept. 
Just a lot on my mind.     
 Yeah, same. Just got the first-day jitters.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 So, has anything, um, come back to you yet     
 about our little amnesia trip?     
 I mean, this can't all be a coincidence, right?     
 Uh, you know, let's focus on one problem at a time, okay?     
 Okay, but, I mean,     
 can I at least help you solve this problem?     
 I can be a research assistant,     
 I'm CPR certified, and I know a little tai chi.     
 Landon, I know this isn't     
 what you want to hear, but the best way     
 that you can help is by evacuating.     
 Well, are you leaving?     
 No. I need to stay here.     
 Okay, then thanks, but I should probably get to class.

 Yo, just because you need to dry out     
 does not mean you need to take down the entire vampire canon.     
 Just because vampires have been like this for the last century     
 doesn't mean we have to stay that way.     
 What are you...?     
 MG, what...?     
 Dracula,  as a novel, has only retained relevance     
 in modern times because of our patriarchal culture's obsession     
 with the idea of a privileged, powerful man     
 who does absolutely what he wants with absolute impunity.     
 Meaning we've spent weeks in this class     
 analyzing the literary value of a character who basically     
 abuses consent in every way...

 Of course you're supposed to take an exam.     
 If you don't pass, you're not allowed to stay.

 ALARIC [OVER P.A.]: The senior witch faculty has mixed together

 So, for those of you who are not getting on the evacuation bus,

 please dose yourselves responsibly.     
 I'm gonna get sued.     
 Or hexed, at the very least.     
 You don't have to be so hard on yourself.     
 At my last school, the gym teacher was     
 dealing coke under the bleachers.     
 Oh, yeah, that only     
 makes me feel marginally better.

 I'm almost done, okay?     
 Okay. What do you think she meant     
 when she said "bring it home"?     
 I'm guessing she means Malivore.     
 It seems her plan is     
 to torment us until we produce the urn.     
 Right. But if the Night Hag     
 is a monster that's trapped on the astral plane,     
 then how can she even physically take the urn anywhere?     
 Yeah, the book also says     
 the Night Hag can't affect our reality, but...     
 Rafael's welt and your hand seemed to prove that wrong.     
 When your research consists of fairy tales and urban legends,     
 sometimes the stories get twisted.     
 Human dragon, anyone?     
 Dorian might be busy with the evacuation,     
 but we'll figure this out.     
 When the Night Hag finds a way to get the urn,

 Well, at least it was a pretty memorable first day.     
 Yeah, and the Night Hag is likely just getting started.

 you'd just evacuate with the others.     
 I worked so hard to get here.

 Raf. Hey. Hey.     
 It's okay. I'm here now.     
 Get away, get away, get away.     
 Hey, it's okay. You can't hurt me.     
 [EXHALES]     
 It's okay.     
 I'm not afraid of hurting you.     
 I want to be with you.     
 Don't you want that, too?     
 I guess I already lived through my nightmare.     
 So screw you and your stupid test,     
 because none of this is real!     
 [LOW CREAKING]     
 No, no, no!     
 I-I didn't.     
 I wasn't feeding. I-I swore off that.     
 NIGHT HAG [ECHOING]: It's who you are.     
 Look around.     
 [YELLING, WHIMPERING]     
 NIGHT HAG: You defend your kind, yet still fear you are wrong.     
 - You are nothing. Nothing! 
- [SCREAMS]     
 [GRUNTING]     
 NIGHT HAG: Small spaces, Landon.     
 Getting smaller.     
 This...     
 is all...     
 you.     
 Fine. So be it.     
 I would never do this to Landon.     
 This isn't real.     
 You're not real!     
 But you wish it was,     
 and that makes you the worst kind of monster.     
 [SHRIEKING]     
 [SHOUTS]     
 You know how to make     
 - your suffering stop. 
- You're damn straight I do.     
 [CACKLES]     
 You know what you need to do to end this.     
 Bring me the urn.     
 You can drop the act.     
 Show me your face.     
 [SHRIEKING]     
 Your real face.     
 [BELLOWS]     
 You know where it is.     
 Yeah. I know where it is.     
 You want the urn so bad?     
 Let's go get it. [SHOUTS]     
 [GASPS]     
 Hope?     
 - Hope. 
- MG: Are we alive, dude?     
 - Did we win? 
- Hey, is everybody okay?

 Hey.     
 Great job tonight.     
 Thanks.     
 Are you okay?     
 You know, all day it feels like I've been waiting     
 for the other shoe to drop with you.     
 You know, uh, when Landon and I first met at Hector and Maria's?     
 He told me the story about this guy four towns over     
 who used to burn him with cigarettes for sport.     
 Yeah, I heard about that.     
 I felt this crazy need to protect him.     
 Even though I knew it wouldn't change anything.     
 So, one day I took a couple buses,     
 I knocked on that guy's door     
 and I beat the crap out of him.     
 I never told Landon about it, either.     
 I knew that he wouldn't want to be a part     
 of something like that.     
 So, what I said earlier about lying, I...     
 I was being a hypocrite.     
 Because when someone is as important     
 as Landon is to me,     
 I'll do what's best for him.     
 Even if that means having to lie.     
 But I'll also have to protect him     
 from being hurt in other ways, too.     
 So, you and I, we can't talk like this anymore.     
 [LAUGHING] Yo.     
 That's one more monster down.     
 You two are now officially part of the Super Squad.     
 Dope.     
 - [LAUGHS] 
- You made it.     
 - Are you ready? 
- What?     
 [BEATBOXING]     
 Oh, here we go. Yeah. He said it. Super Squad.     
 No one realer.     
 Never dreamed I'd be the one to be a dream killer.     
 It's like Salvatore's School meets "Thriller."     
 It tried to creep up on me, but it was sleeping on me.     
 Couldn't touch it, couldn't put my hand on.     
 And MG is the homie I can land on.     
 His girl Hope, I'm-a always take a chance on.     
 She killed a demon,     
 and I just killed the damn song.     
 - [LAUGHS] 
- What?     
 - No, that's crazy. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.     
 Yo, that's nuts. Hey, man, you can play.     
 That was clean. That was clean.     
 Okay, so when did you start playing the guitar?     
 - One second. 
- What?     
 Hope.

 because now I actually had something to lose.     
 And it didn't help that it felt     
 like you were avoiding me,     
 keeping things from me.     
 And then I fought a dream demon.     
 A creature who exists literally

 [GROANS SOFTLY]     
 Tweaked your shoulder throwing me that bolt?     
 Tweaked my body driving it into a tree,     
 and I think I have a concussion.     
 Well, I hope you weren't planning     
 on going to sleep anytime soon.     
 Where did you end up hiding that?     
 In my dream you have     
 a safe tucked away under the floorboards in your closet.     
 You know, I couldn't fully decide on a new hiding spot,     
 so I just stashed it under my pillow.     
 - [CHUCKLES] 
- [CHUCKLES] Go figure.     
 Well, you were all very smart today,     
 while I fell asleep on the job.     
 You drove halfway across the country in three days,     
 cut yourself some slack.     
 We need a new plan.     
 We can't have   % of the students     
 living at the Lockwood Mansion.     
 Well, I'm sure we'll think of something.     
 Hello, uh, Mrs. Maria Gonzales?     
 Mm-hmm.     
 I'm with Child Protective Services.     
 Hector!     
 - How can we help you? 
- I have a few questions     
 for one of your older foster children, if he's around.     
 No, sorry.     
 Rafael was lucky to be adopted     
 by a wonderful family in Virginia.     
 Actually, I'm here to speak with Landon Kirby.     
 Uh, we've discovered some troubling     
 information about his birth parents.     
 Landon was also lucky to be adopted     
 by a wonderful family in Virginia.     
 I see.     
 Our records indicate that you're still receiving subsidy checks     
 for both those boys.     
 If they're no longer in your care, that's a felony.     
 Well, two felonies, each.     
 But I might be able     
 to hold off on reporting that accounting error     
 if there's more you could tell me     
 about Landon Kirby's whereabouts.     
 HECTOR: No, sorry.     
 He was lucky to be adopted by a wonderful family in...     
 Virginia.     
 I see.     
 You've said all you're able to say,     
 literally.     
 In that case, would you happen to have     
 any of this young man's belongings?     
 A journal, a letter,     
 or a photograph?     
 Why don't you come inside?     
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Delighted.
