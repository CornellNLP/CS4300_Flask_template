 Previously on  Legacies...   
 ALARIC:  Yesterday, we were confronted by a dragon.   
 Why do you want this so badly? 
What's so special about it?   
 ALARIC:  And then a gargoyle come to life.   
 None of this started happening until you showed up and stole their knife, which is exactly what the other monsters came here to do.   
 MG: Kaleb.   
 - I saw you feed on her. 
- Yeah.    
 'Cause you got to know who you stand with.    
 - Foster kid, I've been looking for you. 
- Jed, right?    
 We just want to initiate you into the pack.    
 You don't have a choice.   
 [GRUNTING]    
 Landon told me he didn't know why he stole the knife.    
 But then he lied about having it,   
 so I don't know what to believe.   
 ALARIC:  Whoever wields it has the power to save the world  or end all life as we know it.    
 It's hard to say. [LAUGHS]

 ALARIC:  Given recent events,  some students have expressed concern that I am not allowing you to have a say in the decisions that affect your future.    
 And I agree.    
 If you are expected to abide by this school's policies, it's only fair that you have a voice in how those rules are made.    
 So, I am forming an honor council.    
 One vampire, one witch and one werewolf, each elected by their peers.    
 Along with our school counselor Emma, whose vote will represent the younger students.    
 MG is such a narc.    
 ALARIC: Now, I have to go off-campus.    
 In the meantime, I expect you to make good decisions and to vote wisely.    
 That's all. You're dismissed.    
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER]    
 Hi, Dr. Saltzman.    
 Dr. Saltzman. Dr. Saltzman.    
 Um, is there a decision coming about if Landon can stay here?    
 We are running tests on him to figure out once and for all if he's supernatural.    
 What if the results aren't clear?    
 Well, then I have a decision to make.    
 Well, can the honor council decide?    
 Isn't that the point? 
You know, that we have, like, a say in stuff like this?    
 If it comes to that, and we determine he's not a danger, then yes.    
 Thanks.    
 You're not gonna regret this.    
 Dr. Saltzman. Hey.    
 Hi. Um, do you have a minute to talk about Kaleb?    
 - I'm late, MG. 
- It's really important.    
    seconds.    
 Okay, thank you. 'Cause when I told Lizzie about how Kaleb was feeding on the girls at the high school,    
 I didn't think that my big mouth would get him sent to vampire prison.    
 Your big mouth had nothing to do with that.    
 Kaleb's locked up because he needs to dry out.    
 When young vampires feed on humans, they become a threat not only to innocent people, but themselves.    
 That's cool, but, um, I was wondering, maybe you could show him some leniency    
 so that the-the vamps won't be so pissed at me?    
 Trust me, the punishment fits the crime.    
 Unless, of course, you think I'm wrong, in which case you can feel free to bring it up at the honor council meeting.    
 I've got to go.    
 O-Okay. Yeah.    
 - Are you kidding me? 
- [CHUCKLING]: Am I under assault today?    
 You get to interrogate a tree nymph, and I have to run Landon's   andMe.    
 First of all, it's a dryad, not a nymph.    
 Second of all, I need a witch to run the testing spells.    
 - Get Emma to do it. 
- She can supervise, but she's busy managing the school in my, I'm sure, unbearable absence.     
 Plus, if Landon can convince you that he belongs, [CHUCKLES] he can convince anybody.     
 - You're enjoying this. 
- I am.     
 Mm.     
 I left you instructions in my office.     
 Try not to kill him.

 Josie, focus.

 None of this is working.     
 You know, you're not gonna lose the election over an outfit.     
 I'm not worried about losing the election.     
 I'm worried about what I'm going to wear to my victory rally.     
 The outfit makes the speech.     
 How do I look?     
 Maybe you should wear something that shows your fellow witches you're gonna take this seriously.     
 It's a big responsibility.     
 That is why I am perfect for the job.     
 I'm a tastemaker.

 [DOOR OPENS]     
 LANDON: What are you doing here?     
 Dr. Saltzman wanted me to administer your tests, starting with some weird mystical blood analysis.     
 - No. 
- Excuse me?     
 No. These tests determine whether or not I get to stay at the school, right?     
 There is no way I'm putting my future in your hands; you're biased.     
 I'm not biased.     
 Besides, neither of us has a choice.     
 Believe me, this is not how I would choose to spend my day, either.     
 See? Biased.     
 Landon.     
 Last thing that you told me was that you wanted to find answers about who or what you are.     
 I want those answers, too.     
 So let's just get through this.     
 PENELOPE:  Lizzie Saltzman only cares about Lizzie Saltzman.   
 If your interests don't line up with hers, you're witch non grata.     
 I personally believe that you deserve a better candidate.     
 So you're running for honor council just to spite her.     
 That's low, Penelope, even for you.     
 You used to like it when I went low.     
 You know what I mean.     
 You don't even like extracurricular activities, let alone anything that involves a moral compass.     
 Oh, and your one-witch ethics committee is okay with double plagiarism?     
 It is not like "hope" was an option.     
 Bow out now, or I will crush you.     
 Oh, honey, you crush on me.     
 And deep down, you know I'm right.     
 Your sister's unfit for office.     
 DORIAN: We figured out the pattern.     
 The monsters come one at a time.     
 I already had to kill a crazy wraith thing just to find one of you who could communicate about why     
 you want this knife so bad, so it's time to talk.     
 - Why would I talk to evil creatures who kill? 
- [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]     
 Uh, anything yet?     
 Just some light judgment.     
 You're a dryad, right?     
 Living spirit of a tree.     
 Uh, it says here that, uh, dryads were gentle creatures who lived among humans.     
 Well, we're not your enemy.     
 We're just looking for answers.     
 Humans are known to lie.     
 So are monsters.     
 There is a man I cherish named Oliver.     
 If you bring him to me, I will believe that you are trustworthy, or what passes for it among your species.     
 Only then will I answer your questions.     
 Whoa, we're not negotiating, right, Ric?     
 Uh...     
 What should we tell this Oliver?     
 Show him this ring.     
 It belonged to him.     
 He will come with you.     
 I will give no further answers until he does.     
 What if we don't take the deal?     
 Trees are patient.     
 Humans are not.     
 [GRUNTING]     
 All right, I got a medieval history paper due at  :  .     
 Who's on that?     
 I'll do it.     
 But I need a favor.     
 You've been in the pack for five minutes, and you want a favor from your alpha?     
 You're obviously gonna be elected to the honor council.     
 If it comes down to it, will you do what you can to keep Landon in?     
 That's a great idea, foster kid.     
 I'll bring that up at the first meeting.     
 So I can make sure your boy gets the boot.     
 Why?     
 I joined the pack.     
 Yo, I'm following all the stupid rules that...     
 Well, consider that punishment... for not respecting my authority when you got here.     
 The rule is this:     
 What the alpha says goes.     
 And I say Landon goes.     
 What magic have you employed to search for my Oliver?     
 It's a new spell called Google.     
 You're mocking me.     
 Yeah, but just a little bit.     
 Will you open the window? I would like to feel the breeze.     
 Until I know the full extent of your power, I'd rather not.     
 You do not need to fear that I will deceive you.     
 Unlike humans, dryads do not lie.     
 We choose not to harm.     
 Well, in the human world, sometimes telling the truth can do more harm than good.     
 So, who's this Oliver that Dorian went to go find?     
 Oliver never lied.     
 He was not like the other men who would come into the forest to chop down trees so that their houses could be bigger than other houses.     
 He played music.     
 He would lean against the trees and feel happiness.     
 We fell in love.     
 You should know he might not be around anymore.     
 It's been a... a while since those days you remember.     
 Oliver made a great sacrifice; he became a vampire so we might be together forever.     
 We decided to meet at the clearing where we fell in love so we could run away.     
 But circumstance got in the way.     
 Hmm.     
 I feel your pain.     
 You've also lost a great love.     
 A psychic tree: check.     
 Is your humor helpful in avoiding your pain?     
 Not really, no.     
 You carry more than one loss.     
 Several.     
 Including the mother of my children.     
 But there's happiness there, too.     
 I see it in their smiles, in their laughter.     
 I still see her sometimes.     
 DORIAN: Good news, bad news.     
 Our pal Bonnie did her witch thing on the ring.     
 Some sort of combo summoning spell and astral projection,     
 so...     
 Can someone please tell me what's going on here?     
 Oliver.     
 I'm sorry, do I know you?     
 I'm guessing that's the bad news.     
 [WHISPERS]: Yeah.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Hey, I'm doing it.     
 - Now what? 
- Hold it for ten minutes.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 What? [GRUNTS]     
 [GRUNTING]     
 You can stop.     
 You failed. You have no supernatural strength.     
 - What's next? 
- Next?     
 You failed the vertical climb, the long jump, and you straight-up refused to swim across the lake.     
 Yeah, well, excuse the foster kid for never having swim lessons.     
 Look,     
 I might suck at-at... everything, apparently, but I only have to pass one test to stay, so I'm not giving up yet.     
 How's it going?     
 Landon was about to run sprints to the lake and back.     
 What are you testing for, exactly?     
 His ability to get away from me as quickly as possible.     
 If he's gonna stay in this school, it's a must.     
 Did you run the lineage spell that I left you?     
 Yeah, first thing. Zero magic in his bloodline.     
 Hmm.     
 Hmm?     
 Most humans have some trace of magical blood in their veins from a far-flung ancestor.     
 So what does that mean?     
 We need to learn more about Landon's past.     
 HOPE:  What's your name?   
 Landon Kirby.     
 See? That's the truth.     
 Now lie.     
 What's your favorite food?     
 Rabbit.     
 So it's a...     
 supernatural lie detector.     
 Pretty much your worst nightmare.     
 Bring it on, Hope.     
 Where were you born?     
 I don't know.     
 Who are your parents?     
 My mom's name is Seylah.     
 That's pretty much all I know.     
 She gave me up for adoption when I was young.     
 - And your dad? 
- Never met him.     
 - Why can't you be compelled? 
- I have no idea.     
 A couple days ago, I didn't even know what compulsion was.     
 Why'd you take the knife?     
 I don't know. I don't... 
I remember doing it, but I don't remember why.     
 It's not good enough.     
 If we can't figure out what you are, then you can't stay at this school.     
 This is such an honor.     
 It's so nice to know that you all love me as much as I thought you did.     
 Hey, Lizzie, before you go too far down the road of victory speeches, I talked to Serena and her goth coven. She said that they would vote for you, but they just wanted to make sure that you would allow time off for pagan holidays.     
 - Right. 
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 - Hey, Raf. 
- Hey, Jo.     
 Welcome to the winner's circle.     
 How's it going with Jackass Jed?     
 I mean, do you need any more advice on how to deal with Cro-Magnon alphas?     
 That's actually why I'm here.     
 - Lizzie. 
- Hey.     
 You got a sec?     
 I have a lot of secs.     
 I mean... time.     
 The honor council might get to decide if Landon can stay.     
 Emma won't say how she's gonna vote, but I talked to MG, and he's the only vampire running, and he's on board.     
 And because everybody knows that you're gonna get the witch vote, I...     
 Say no more.     
 I know how much     
 Landon means to you, and I would be happy to help.     
 I mean, all right. Thank you.     
 [CHUCKLES] Seriously.     
 Oh, if-if you would, um, be happy to...     
 be my date to my birthday on Friday?     
 [CLATTERING]     
 Are you blackmailing me?     
 [CHUCKLES]: No, silly.     
 I'm black-tie'ing you.     
 It's totally different.     
 Sure.     
 Whatever.     
 [EXHALES]     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 [LAUGHING]     
 What up, Kaleb?     
 The hell you want, man?     
 I, uh... I-I copped this from the kitchen.     
 I thought you might be hungry.     
 Not for bunny blood.     
 It's the only blood in the school, man.     
 Then hunger strike it is, I guess.     
 I'm sorry that you're in here, but let me make it up to you.     
 Dr. Saltzman is starting an honor council.     
 And if I get elected, I can change things around here, starting with getting you out of this cell.     
 Mm. You'd do that for me?     
 Yeah, of course.     
 Well, all right.     
 Send the vamps my way.     
 I'll get 'em in line.     
 Thanks, man. Hey, you won't regret this.     
 I promise.     
 Okay.     
 JED: We'll blow out these walls, get a full-sized basketball court in here.     
 They haven't touched this place since...     
 We need to talk, Jed.     
 We already did.     
 Just hear me out.     
 I've got the vampires and the witches.     
 But I need one more faction to make sure.     
 Be nice to know I could count on my own pack.     
 Yeah, see, that's the thing, Raf.     
 They're not your pack.     
 They're mine.     
 Thought you might say that.     
 All right.     
 I've actually been studying all those books you make other people read for you.     
 Like  Intro to Lycanthropy.   
 An alpha has to face a challenger one-on-one.     
 I didn't want to do things this way.     
 But if what the alpha says goes...     
 ...I got to be the alpha.

 The werewolf representative will be...     
 Rafael.     
 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

 So much for not wanting anything to do with the pack.     
 I've always wanted to be part of a power couple.

 EMMA: And the witch representative will be...     
 Josie.     
 [GASPING, MURMURING]     
 Thank you all for voting.     
 And congratulations to our newly elected representatives.     
 There were so many in that grove.     
 Do you not remember any of us?     
 ALARIC: But she knew you.     
 She knows your name, that you're a vampire.     
 I'm not sure what's going on here, but...     
 ...we've never met before.     
 In the forest, there was a clearing next to the river.     
 The bed would blossom with daffodils every spring.     
 Yeah, I walk there every day.     
 It's where I proposed to my wife.     
 You are married.     
 Yeah.     
 Why did you ask me about the clearing?     
 I'm sorry.     
 I made a mistake.     
 I thought you were someone else.     
 You said you'd help me get answers.     
 I didn't even want to do this.     
 Don't blame me because you're not special.     
 I apologized for lying to you.     
 I explained why I took the knife.     
 Why are you still so mad at me?     
 I'm not mad.     
 I couldn't care less.     
 Fine. It's easier to be mad.     
 - Why? 
- Because it is.     
 Or maybe it's because you feel like if you stop being mad, you're letting your guard down, and the legendary Hope Mikaelson couldn't possibly do that.     
 When I let my guard down, people disappoint me.     
 Growing up in the foster system...     
 ...every time I got sent someplace new, I'd hope that this would be the right place.     
 You know, like, uh,     
 "click your heels three times,"     
 "no place like home" kind of stuff.     
 Just somewhere I actually belonged.     
 But it never was.     
 You know, and you can only hold out hope for so long and-and be hurt by so many people before its starts to seems impossible to trust someone new.     
 Especially when they lie to you.     
 So, for the last time, I'm sorry.     
 I broke your trust.     
 I don't want to do it again.     
 Thank you.     
 But if this goes the wrong way, can you just make sure that Raf doesn't, um, follow me this time?     
 As much as I want to stay here, he needs to.     
 He finally found a home he deserves.     
 I'm not gonna take that away from him.     
 Oh.     
 Hey, Jed.     
 You don't belong here.     
 Yeah. Everyone keeps saying that.     
 Everything was fine before you and Rafael showed up.     
 Wait, wait.     
 [GRUNTING]     
 [GROWLING]     
 [GRUNTING AND GROANING]     
 [COUGHS]     
 [SIGHS]     
 I'm gonna tear Jed apart.     
 HOPE: No, you're really not.     
 He's gonna pay for what he did.     
 He could've killed him.     
 You want to do something to help him?     
 Take a walk to the herb garden and get me some hazelwood root.     
 [SIGHS]     
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]     
 What does hazelwood root do?     
 Make him cool off before he realizes that I made it up.     
 Raf's had a... a rough couple of weeks.     
 Look who's talking.     
 Guess we can cross "supernatural healing" off the list.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 I'm sorry that this happened to you.     
 Jed's one of those rare cases where his bite is actually worse than his bark.     
 I've dealt with bullies before.     
 Not like this.     
 I know how badly you want to stay here, but this school is full of people like Jed.     
 Some of us are nicer, some of us have more control, but all of us are capable of doing what he did.     
 Do you honestly think that you're safe here?     
 Yes, I do.     
 You should rest.     
 Can I...     
 Shh.     
 ...get you anything?     
 I said, "Shh."     
 [SNIFFS] I'm trying... to rise above it.     
 So let me freaking rise.     
 Okay, I don't know why Penelope had them vote for me.     
 It doesn't make any sense.     
 What's done is done, Jo.     
 Well, I can step down, and then they'd have to go with the runner-up.     
 Great minds think alike.     
 I already asked Emma if we could do that.     
 And Emma said no?     
 Well, then we can ask Dad.     
 She said yes, except...     
 it turns out...     
 I wasn't the runner-up, either.     
 Let me guess. There's been a mistake.     
 I won the popular vote, but not the electoral college.     
 No.     
 You won fair and square, besides the part where you stabbed me in the back.     
 [INHALES SHARPLY] Ooh.     
 Doesn't feel too good, does it?     
 Emma sent me to come and get you.     
 Okay.     
 [KEYS JANGLING]     
 
 
 
 [LOCK CLUNKS]     
 [DOOR CREAKING]     
 I only wanted to be elected so that I could fix things between us.     
 You did.     
 We're even now.     
 How's the interrogation going?     
 ALARIC: She's not talking.     
 But I think I figured out why no one remembers dragons, gargoyles or dryads existing.     
 I mean, whatever happened to these creatures, it erased all memory of them.     
 It's like they never existed in the first place.     
 I guess that explains a lot.     
 Well, don't sound so excited.     
 It's only a massive piece of the puzzle that explains why these creatures only exist in legends and myths.     
 Sorry. I'm just having a day.     
 Listen, I want a seat on the council.     
 I'm a tribrid... The only one of my kind.     
 No one can represent my interests but me.     
 Is this about Landon?     
 Because you can't let this get personal.     
 The political is personal.     
 I learned that in Advanced Civics, taught by you.     
 That's cheating.     
 But I trust that you'll make the right call.     
 [WIND WHISTLING]     
 It's been hours.     
 She's not gonna tell us anything.     
 [WIND WHISTLING]     
 Oh, that feels nice.     
 Thank you, Alaric.     
 From somebody who has lost exactly what you lost today...     
 ...I'm sorry.     
 I will honor our deal.     
 What do you wish to know?     
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING]     
 [DOOR SLIDING OPEN]     
 Sorry I'm late.     
 Hold up. Who voted for her?     
 I ran unopposed.     
 [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]     
 We're here to discuss if Landon should be allowed to stay at the school.     
 My vote, on behalf of the lower school, is to err on the side of inclusion.     
 We exist to help kids like him.     
 Which is what I'm going to go do now.     
 I have a search party out looking for Jed.     
 As you've all seen, violence leads to more violence.     
 If you'll excuse me.     
 All right, who wants to start?     
 Landon has to go.     
 Never thought I'd be saying this, but... Hope's right.     
 Humans refuse to make a place for us in their world.     
 We start letting them in, it's only a matter of time before they take this place from us, too.     
 Landon goes.     
 Landon is my brother.     
 He's the only reason I'm alive.     
 He can't go back to human life     
 knowing that magic and dragons exist.     
 We took his whole crappy life from him.     
 Be awful selfish of us not to give him one to replace it.     
 [SIGHS]     
 That's two-one.     
 Doesn't matter how much we want him to stay.     
 Look what one mad wolf did to him.     
 Earlier, I asked him if he felt safe here.     
 He said "yes."     
 He was lying.   
 This place is dangerous for him, and even he knows it.     
 - I will protect him. 
- And where were you an hour ago?     
 That's the point.     
 If he stays, it's on all of us.     
 It is all of our responsibility to protect him.     
 Can we honestly say we believe every one of us can handle     
 that kind of a responsibility?     
 KALEB: Looks like it's on you, Josie.     
 DRYAD: The night I was to leave with Oliver, something attacked me, and I woke up in an endless darkness.     
 I could feel the presence of others, but not see or hear them.     
 I was there for so long, and then, just as suddenly,     
 I found myself not far from here.     
 With an urge to possess that knife.     
 Why? What is this?     
 I do not know.     
 Only that I must have it.     
 It's like something... something pressing inside me, telling me to take it.     
 Take it where?     
 There is a dark pit beneath the earth.     
 Locked away.     
 I can see it. I can feel it.     
 I am meant to take the knife there.     
 If I do, I will find peace and finally be free.     
 And who told you to do this?     
 A voice in my mind.     
 It is still there.     
 I tried to fight it, but I am not strong enough.     
 [WIND WHISTLING]     
 I'm sorry. I have no choice.     
 Watch out.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Dorian, the knife.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Take me to the daffodils.     
 Take me home.     
 Take me, please.     
 Josie.     
 Please.     
 Since Landon walked through those doors, my sister, my father and I have almost died.     
 We don't really know what Landon is, so we can't really say if we know if he's dangerous or not.     
 Raf, this isn't about who's friends with who or who you like.     
 This school is family, and I am not putting my family in danger again.     
 Raf.     
 - Raf, stop. 
- [CHUCKLES]     
 You know what, I'm done with both of y'all.     
 Watch your head.     
 I was wrong about you... Dorian.     
 You kept your word.     
 Not all humans lie.     
 It's okay.     
 I wish more monsters were like you.     
 I remembered something else.     
 That black pit,     
 that awful place,     
 it is called Malivore.     
 Malivore.     
 Thank you.     
 I'm sorry this happened.

 It's sweet of you not to want to hurt the punching bag.     
 You want to take its place?     
 Don't blame me.     
 It's the rest of the witches who knew how bad you'd be at that job.     
 What did I ever do to make you hate me so much?     
 It's not about you.     
 Shocking, I know.     
 It's about how you treat Josie.     
 I love Josie.     
 Did you think to ask her if she wanted to run for the council before you assumed you'd win?     
 You've left her with no room for herself.     
 She spends all of her energy taking care of you.     
 She doesn't have time for a relationship because you are a black hole of time and energy and love, just sucking it all up.     
 Never giving any of it back.     
 Oh, she won't ever burn your world down.     
 So I will do it for her.     
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]     
 [CRYING]     
 Dissulta.   
 - LANDON: Thanks for walking me. 
- HOPE: Yeah.     
 LANDON: I had to go before Rafael tried to follow me again.     
 We didn't take the vote lightly. It was close.     
 Yeah, I don't really need to hear about that.     
 I'm in enough pain as it is.     
 - I voted no. 
- Yeah.     
 Didn't need to know that.     
 Why, exactly?     
 Remember when you asked me to make sure that Raf didn't follow you?     
 You did it 'cause you care about him, because... you wanted to do what was right for him.     
 Even though it was hard.     
 Is that your way of admitting you care about me?     
 Maybe I'm a little biased.     
 New Orleans.     
 I have a family friend there that's expecting you.     
 I asked him to help you find your birth mom.     
 What?     
 I couldn't get you the answers that you wanted, but he can.     
 With this.     
 I put the results of your lineage spell in there.     
 And, um, some money.     
 And a sandwich.     
 I hope you like ham. [CHUCKLES]     
 Thank you.     
 Yeah.     
 Oh, and, um... and this.     
 What is this?     
 Think of it like a...     
 "click your heels together three times" kind of thing.     
 If you ever need me, just press it, and my bracelet will lead me to you.     
 I should go.     
 Okay.     
 Bye.     
 Bye, Landon.     
 I wanted to see if it worked.

 No, wait. I'm sorry.     
 About Landon.     
 I thought that Josie would vote with you.     
 I don't know what happened. Other than that, apparently I'm the worst person in the world.
