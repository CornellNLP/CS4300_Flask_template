 ...War is coming, Shadow. 
 And if I don't have the loyalty of my own son,  how can I expect support from anyone else? 
 You were supposed to go to Lakeside. 
 I don't do your bidding anymore. 
 We're done. 
 You are on a path  from nothing to everything. 
 I can help you. 
 Don't lose this. 
 What about Lakeside? 
 You got an apartment waiting for you there. 
 I'm good. 
 Chicago, please. 
 One way. 
 I do have one. 
 - Leaving for Lakeside, Wisconsin. 
 Hey, mister! 
 My friend, here, Alison... 
 Have a great night. 
 Ann-Marie Hinzelmann. 
 You the fellow that needs a ride? 
 When the Great River gave birth to the First Ones,  they asked Inaemehkiwok, the Thunderbird,  to watch over our people. 
 Inaemehkiwok welcomed the Great Sun to warm us. 
 Summoned the rain to make the crops grow, and battled Misikinubik,  the Great Horned Snake. 
 ♪  Inaemehkiwok. 
 ♪  ♪  The cop, Chad... 
 something,  he just dropped me off. 
 The key broke off in the lock. 
 Other half, it's in my left hoodie pocket. 
 Left side. 
 Turn around. 
 I was wondering when you'd show up. 
 ♪  My name's Mike, by the way. 
 Mike Ainsel. 
 Wait here. 
 Next time you get locked out,  knock on the door before you go breaking and entering. 
 I didn't catch your name, by the way.

 ♪  ♪  I can't seem to save anything. 
 It just keeps crashing. 
 Interesting, ma'am. 
 When was the last time you did a system upgrade? 
 Ah! 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 You know the rules. 
 Okay. 
 Stop. 
 No... 
 touching. 
 All these games we play... 
 none of them work. 
 You do not lay hands on me. 
 You've never done this before. 
 I can't touch you? 
 I own the biggest IT company in the world. 
 Everyone wants something from me. 
 Everyone wants what I have to give. 
 It's like I'm a f*cking god. 
 So I come here to restore some balance. 
 Because I thought that you were different than the others. 
 There are no others like me. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, I see. 
 You're special. 
 As a matter of fact, I am special. 
 Because I choose to spend my time with you. 
 No! 
 Because I am a goddess. 
 You're smoke and mirrors. 
 And you're a showgirl. 
 And this is your stage, bought and paid for  by William Huntington Sanders. 
 But you can call me Bill.

 Also, don't forget to bring the coin. 
 ♪  For heaven's sake, Mike,  get in the car before you get hypothermia! 
 In weather like this,  you're out there for five minutes  with improper attire,  and well, the only ride you're gonna need  is to the coroner's in Eau Claire. 
 I was walking into town to buy a jacket. 
 It's a good thing you're pretty. 
 Ah! 
 Look at the beautiful clunker. 
 Clunker? 
 Every year, we take a wreck,  we put it out on the lake,  and then, folks guess the date and the time  when it'll break through the ice come spring. 
 And then, the winner splits the pot with the high school. 
 It's really fun. 
 You're gonna love it. 
 Now, while Lakeside is known for its fishing,  it's the to-die-for pasties  that put us on the map. 
 Every delicious bite is like a warm hug. 
 But you know what really makes this place special? 
 The people. 
 - Everyone here genuinely cares for their neighbor. 
 It's in everything we do. 
 This spirit was passed down to us  by the town's first citizen and benefactor, Lester Hamilton. 
 And when he died, he left Lakeside his fortune  so that its citizens would continue to prosper. 
 All he asked in return was that we honor  some of his favorite Old World traditions. 
 So every year, we hold an ice festival  to celebrate his generosity  and give thanks for our magical little town  and its Nordic heritage. 
 I think you're gonna like it here. 
 Rat-Faced Irresistible. 
 The trout'll jump into your frying pan  once word gets out you got one of these babies. 
 You talking this poor man's ear off, Ann-Marie? 
 Lee Hennings, proprietor. 
 Mike Ainsel. 
 What can we do for you, Mr. Ainsel? 
 You need to get this fella into something warmer  than a sweatshirt. 
 Nothing too hardcore. 
 Not sure how long I'll be in this part of the country for. 
 He's the new tenant on Gorman Street. 
 Gorman? 
 Heh. 
 We were wondering when somebody was gonna move in there. 
 Welcome. 
 Alison, can you show Mr. Ainsel  the parkas, please? 
 And we've got some great  after-Christmas sales on sweaters, too. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. 
 I remember you. 
 Last night, outside of the bus,  um, my friend and I were being jerks. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I was having a bad day. 
 Made me smile. 
 Um, okay. 
 Uh, well, here are the parkas. 
 And, um, here are the on-sale sweaters,  although, personally, I'd avoid the Christmas ones. 
 They're super lame. 
 Right. 
 Okay. 
 Let's see what this one looks like. 
 Okay. 
 What do you think? 
 Amazing. 
 I mean... 
 I mean it seems to fit you really well. 
 Well, that is good enough for me. 
 I will take it. 
 Right, these sweaters. 
 Anything in reindeer? 
 Uh, yeah, yes, I do. 
 What say we sell Mr. 
 Ainsel  a clunker ticket, Alison? 
 I was just about to ask. 
 Okay. 
 Just need to, uh, pick a date and a time. 
 ♪  When do you think it will go through the ice? 
 ♪  March 23rd. 
 7 p.m. till 8 p.m. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, most people pick more than one day. 
 But, uh, I guess this is your strategy. 
 That's it. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I guess I gotta admire  a man who goes with his instincts. 
 Good luck. 
 Five dollars. 
 ♪  Now...  which one of your teeth... 
 are loose, huh? 
 Is it this one here? 
 Ho! 
 Whoa. 
 Now that wasn't so bad, was it? 
 No. 
 Hey, I'll tell you what,  I'll pay you twice the Tooth Fairy's going rate  if I may keep this molar for my research. 
 Yeah! 
 ♪  ♪  When did our soldiers  first carry our totems into battle? 
 When Gudfred f*cked up that Frankish business. 
 The last time was Yorktown. 
 We abandoned our post as Hessian Jaegers  and joined Washington's ranks. 
 Half the art of war is knowing when to switch sides. 
 Mm. 
 You have done well for yourself. 
 Oh, I'm comfortable. 
 Tyr, the warlord, comfortable? 
 Well, the gladiator's bloodlust  doesn't make for a very lucrative business. 
 Ha! 
 But if it's a war god you want... 
 All I want from you is a donation. 
 Oh, I'm flattered. 
 ♪  You came all this way  when you could have put the touch on me in Chicago. 
 At the Koliada? 
 Hum... 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Chicago. 
 For Zorya Vechernyaya. 
 Couldn't wait 'til then? 
 Prosecuting the war is an all-consuming endeavor. 
 Things come up all the time, last minute. 
 Memorials are all well and good,  but we both know that an eye for an eye  don't come cheap. 
 Well, anything for the cause. 
 Should I make it out to...? 
 "Cash" will be just fine. 
 Very generous. 
 How are your teeth? 
 Nice try. 
 - Oh, top of the morning to you, Sal! 
 All right, where was I? 
 Oh, right! 
 Okay, Lakeside News is just down that-a-way. 
 It was started by Zachary Morgan in 1902. 
 He died of syphilis wearing a diaper, poor fella. 
 Nice. 
 Um, so actually... 
 Andy! 
 I hope you're looking  for a present for your wife! 
 Your anniversary is coming up. 
 He happens to forget things  like annual marital events, like anniversaries. 
 Mabel's Restaurant is right over here,  and the pasties, as I mentioned earlier,  are the best things ever. 
 You know, she inherited the recipe from her grandmother,  who brought it over here from Cornwall. 
 If I could just sneak in a quick question about where to rent a car. 
 Oh, that's Eau Claire, that... 
 I heard from Martha  that Kathy's unmentionables were stolen  right from her laundry basket! 
 I know, I know, I know. 
 Let's not all get in a fuss  over the Piggly Wiggly rumor mill. 
 - Oh, hey, Ann-Marie. 
 - Hi, Chad. 
 Oh, Mike. 
 I see Lee Henning's taken good care of you. 
 Now you're lookin' more local. 
 Lot warmer at least. 
 What's Meg Gunther in a lather about? 
 Lingerie. 
 Apparently, three pairs  of her days-of-the-week underwear:  Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday,  all went missing from the dryer. 
 So, in her mind, we have a, uh, panty thief on the loose. 
 See, Mike, this is what qualifies  as major crime here in Lakeside. 
 You know, if you're rich, you live in Monte Carlo. 
 And if you're famous, you live in California. 
 But if you're lucky, you live here in... 
 in Lakeside. 
 Oh, shoot. 
 I'm supposed to meet Bart up at the inlet. 
 I am so sorry. 
 Um, hey, Chad,  could you get our newest resident situated with a pasty? 
 Oh, you don't have to ask me twice. 
 - I'm starving. 
 - Okay. 
 - Come on. 
 - All right. 
 - Thank you. 
 - You're gonna love it. 
 You know, interestingly, uh,  Mabel's amazing pasty recipe,  she actually inherited from her grandmother. 
 Came all the way from Cornwall. 
 Grab a seat. 
 How you doing this morning, sweetie? 
 Hey, Mabel, this is Mike. 
 He's staying up at the spot on Gorman. 
 Oh, it's nice to meet you, Mike. 
 - Hey. 
 - Can I show you a menu, hon? 
 Uh, well, everyone's been talking about these pasties. 
 Uh, one pasty on the house it is. 
 It's complimentary to first-time customers. 
 Ah, thank you. 
 Can I get a coffee too? 
 I already know what this cowboy's having. 
 Chief Mulligan. 
 Hey, there. 
 What's good? 
 Ah, don't leave me hanging, dawg. 
 You know Derek? 
 Ah, no. 
 I think he just wants me to know he's down. 
 So, uh, what do you do for a living, Mike? 
 Uh, just working for my uncle right now. 
 What's he do? 
 He runs an import-export business. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 What kind? 
 Antiques, mostly. 
 I sound like a cop, don't I? 
 Little bit. 
 Yeah, that's a force of habit. 
 Jeez, Mike, I'm sorry. 
 - I don't mean to pry. 
 - It's all good. 
 Here you go, gents. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Now, careful. 
 If you leave here hungry,  it's your own dang fault.

 Property Manager. 
 So, you two have met. 
 At gun point. 
 Mr. Ainsel tried to break into his apartment last night. 
 Due to a key malfunction. 
 Fortunately, no one was hurt. 
 Well, the wiser course of action  would have been to call your local law enforcement. 
 Hmm. 
 Uh, Mike here is looking for some transportation,  and, uh, Sandy's old beater came to mind. 
 The car is not for sale. 
 Uh, it's, uh... been parked out back  better part of two years now.

 Just trying to get to Chicago. 
 ♪  What's in Chicago? 
 Memorial service for a friend. 
 I leave this afternoon. 
 You may want to wait a day or two. 
 The interstate's always a mess after a storm. 
 I need to be there tonight.

 A hundred dollars for the two days. 
 Bring it back like you found it. 
 If I get it cleaned up? 
 A hundred and fifty.

 Thank you.

 "My new mission is of vital importance to Mr. 
 Wednesday. 
 I don't know how long it will take  or how long I will be gone. 
 Consider this the end of our journey. 
 Don't look for me."  So you know nothing of this "mission"? 
 I haven't seen or heard anything  from Mr Wednesday in months. 
 All I know is whatever task  Wednesday has demanded of the Jinn,  it has driven us apart. 
 But perhaps the Jinn made up his own mind? 
 Feelings can change. 
 If he truly does not love me,  I need to hear him say it to my face. 
 Well, I'm due in Chicago for the festival of Koliada. 
 The Old Gods are assembling to honor the ascendance  of Zorya Vechernyaya's soul.

 The balls on you, Votan. 
 Are you here to pay your respect to Zorya? 
 I don't think so. 
 You're here because of your stupid war. 
 Is that a sin? 
 I came here to mourn the death  of someone who once owned my heart,  and at the same time find myself surrounded  by Slavic deities of every stripe.
