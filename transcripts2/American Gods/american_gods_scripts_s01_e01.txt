 The land reached was barren, rocky.   
 No food, no shelter.   
 Only biting insects and snakes.   
 When they set off, they dreamt   of the riches they would accumulate,   the fat-breasted women they would send for.

 They did not yet have a word in their language   for "miserable." 
 They would have to invent one.   
 It was time to leave this accursed land,   but their sails hung flabby as Grandmother's teat.   
 The wind did not wish them to leave.   
 They were becalmed astride hell.   
 Lucky they knew wind can be reasoned with.   
 The All-Father could intercede   with the wind on their behalf,   but they feared he would not know   to look this far from home.   
 They would have to make him look.

 You don't worry if they're going to get you    when they already got you.

 I believe in plenty when there's reason and evidence to believe. 
 I don't believe in anything I can't see. 
 I feel like there's a f*cking axe hanging over my head.

 Says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery. 
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Served three and were due to be released on Friday. 
 Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon. 
 You'll be getting out a couple of days early. 
 (SIGH) 
 There's no good way to say this, so I'll put it plain. 
 This came in from Johnson City Hospital in Eagle Point. 
 Your wife... 
 she died in the early hours of this morning. 
 Was a... an automobile accident.

 I have to get to Eagle Point, yeah. 
 It's for a funeral. 
 Not without an original death certificate, and there's no emails, and there's no copies. 
 Do not piss off those bitches in airports.  Take a lesson from Johnnie Larch. 
 I don't know Johnnie Larch. 
 Johnnie Larch got out after five years. 
 He gets to the airport,     hands his ticket to the woman at the counter, who asks for his driver's license. 
 He gives it to her. 
 She says, "It's expired." He says, "It might not be a valid drivers license, "but it is a damn fine identification. 
 "There's my picture, my weight, and my height. 
 Who the f*ck do you think it is?" She says, "I'll thank you for not using that sort of language with me, sir." He says, "Give me my f*cking boarding pass right f*cking now." Now, he has the right to take that tone. 
 She was disrespecting him. 
 You don't let people disrespect you in prison. 
 Why the f*ck would he let her disrespect him as a free man? 
 Mm-mm. 
 She hit a button.

 Straight-up sympathy play, huh?

 Airlines are the ultimate clip joint. 
 They deserve that and worse. 
 What would you have done, my boy? 
 Uh, good Samaritan. 
 You know, gentleman's curve, if I was a traveling man. 
 - Oh, which you are not. 
 - Mm-mm. 
 No, sir, not me. 
 Seems like a firm decision made for good reasons. 
 I can respect that. 
 A man gets out of prison, he should concentrate above all on not going back. 
 Oh, don't worry about me. 
 I got an eye for these things. 
 Just the one, but I can see that you're not used to the fresh air, but I don't see the joy of being out. 
 Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time. 
 What should I call you if I were so inclined? 
 Shadow Moon. 
 Oh, my boy, that is one outstandingly improbable name. 
 Shadow Moon. 
 Moon Shadow. 
 Goddamn hippie parents. 
 Hippie parent. 
 Mama had a big afro, huh? 
 "Dancing Queen," hmm? 
 Yeah. 
 She had the whole kit. 
 And if I was inclined, what might I call you? 
 What's today? 
 Wednesday. 
 Hmm. 
 Today's my day. 
 Let's go with that, huh? 
 Thank you so much, darling. 
 P.A.: Ladies and gentleman please remain...   
 - Ah. 
 - Thanks. 
 Hmm. 
 Always good to meet a fellow traveler, Shadow... 
 Oh. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But when you were, what was your downfall? 
 Uh, casinos. 
 Oh, bang-bang. 
 Big time, huh? 
 Yeah, and some small time. 
 All right. 
 - Hmm? 
 - Ah! 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 Yeah. 
 Better at the small than big. 
 Ah, you got more talent than me. 
 I got two. 
 One is I can sleep anywhere, any time. 
 The other one is that I usually end up getting what I want... 
 on average, over time.

 Now, what's keeping us aloft? 
 Faith or Newton? 
 Mm. 
 They give you a free little sh1t kit in first class. 
 You might not have known that. 
 How are you fixed for work? 
 Who needs work when you're rich, huh? 
 Well, I just happens to be in a hiring position. 
 And I could be Mr. 
 Wednesday with a shake of the hand. 
 I mean, perfectly legal work, for the most part. 
 Good money, open roads, no aggravation... 
 well, a little bit by and by, but, uh, you know, I would have no hesitation hiring an ex-con. 
 Don't rush into this. 
 Take your time, hmm? 
 No, thank you, but I already have a job waiting for me    
 - at my buddy's gym. 
 - No you don't. 
 I could use a fellow like you. 
 There's always work for a big guy who's smart enough to know he's better off letting people think he's dumb. 
 Oh, and by the way, did I mention the bonuses? 
 Outstanding benefits. 
 I'll even throw in a pension if you'd like, and I can tell you what the f*ck a pension is. 
 Hell, by the end of your tenure, you could be the next king of America. 
 And I told you, I got a job. 
 Ah, of course, of course. 
 Anyway, as a wise man once said, a man gets out of prison, he should be focused above all on not going back.

Robbie did his best to avoid looking at me. Get used to the boot, puppy. There is no closure from the dead. Maybe, you know, three years from now, some therapist will tell you, uh, to write her a letter saying everything you wish you could say to her and drop it in the ocean. And maybe it'll help. It won't help. I'm sorry for your loss, Shadow. I really am. (SOB) Anyone tell you that yet? I'm not sure. Anyone even hug you? sh1t. Well, you just got out of prison. You haven't been hugged in how long? I read that's a thing with ex-cons, forgetting what it's like just to feel someone. Oh, sh1t. You... You worked out in prison. (CHUCKLE) I have a proposal for closure for us both. - Audrey... - No, no. Hear me out. This is a good one. Lex talionis.  An eye for an eye, blow job for a blow job, right here where they can see us. I appreciate the offer, but... My husband and your wife... my best friend... I want them to see it. I want Robbie to watch while I take this gorgeous man's cock in my mouth. Pissing on him wasn't enough. I want you to come in my mouth, I'm going to spit it on his grave. Jesus, who knew I could be so angry? No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You're right. f*ck me already. Oh. Don't, Audrey. Audrey, don't. I can't do this. I am trying to get my dignity back here! Look, hold on. Wait. Audrey! (SOBBING) (INSECT WINGS FLUTTERING) (FLUTTERING STOPS) Hello, Shadow. Don't f*ck with me. Okay. I won't. Uh, but if you could just drop me off    - at the Motel America... - Hit him. See, I said don't f*ck with me. Now that, that was f*cking with me. Keep your answers short and to the point, or I will f*cking kill you, or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just have The Children here break every bone in your f*cking body. So don't f*ck with me. Got it. You're working for Wednesday. Yeah. - Smoke? - No, thank you. (COUGHING) Well, it's not tobacco, and it ain't weed. Smells like an appliance fire. Synthetic toad skins. Hmm. What the f*ck is Wednesday after? What's he doing here? There's got to be a plan. What's the game plan, man? I started working for Mr. Wednesday this morning. How auspicious. You must be special. No, I'm just an errand boy. Is that all? (COUGHING) Wednesday is history. Forgotten and... old. He should just let it happen. We are the future, and we don't give a f*ck about him or anyone else like him anymore. They are consigned to the dumpster. Now we have reprogrammed reality. Language is a virus. Religion, an operating system, and prayers are just so much f*cking spam. Okay, w-well, y-you're saying all this like I'm supposed to know what the f*ck you're talking about. The dominant f*cking paradigm, Shadow. That is the only important thing. Oh, by the way, I was sorry to hear about your wife. Tough break. Thanks. So I will ask again. What is it Wednesday is up to? We barely exchanged a dozen words. But you can let me out here and then I'll walk the rest of the way. You're saying that you don't know? Telling you I don't know. Would you tell me even if you did? Probably not. As you say, I work for Mr. Wednesday. Well, then why the f*ck am I wasting my time sitting here talking to you? You know, I was curious myself how long you would go on sucking your own dick. Kill him. We're not just going to kill you, Shadow. We're going to delete you. One click, and you are overwritten. Undelete... that is not an option. ♪♪   ♪♪   Aah! ♪♪   (CROW CAWS)
