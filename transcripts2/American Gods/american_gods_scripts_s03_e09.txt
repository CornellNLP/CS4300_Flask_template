 Find Bilquis. 
 She f*cked me up. 
 Make her fix me. 
 Go into the hoard. 
 You get the spear. 
 You bring it back to me. 
 Wish me luck. 
 I couldn't help overhearing you  asking about Derek. 
 Derek's a troubled kid. 
 Not a bad kid, mind you. 
 You know, this goes a lot better for you, Derek,  if you just tell me what happened to Alison. 
 No, I had nothing to do with this Alison sh1t. 
 You've always wanted a normal life. 
 Now you can have it. 
 Your obligation  to me has been fulfilled. 
 I'm proud of the man you've become. 
 The f*ck? 
 That's Gungnir, Odin's spear. 
 What do you really plan to do with that? 
 I'm gonna kill Wednesday. 
 Lakeside, Wisconsin, please. 
 Make it Jacksonville. 
 Put yourself back in charge  so you can become your best you. 
 How? 
 With SHARD. 
 Coming soon, a future that puts its faith in you. 
 f*ck! 
 - SHARD... 
 - f*cking hell! 
 They're calling it the most downloaded,  highest-trending media push ever released. 
 Totally crashed the Internet this week. 
 Uh, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook. 
 Apparently, it's working. 
 Nine million subscriptions on Day 1. 
 Nine, people. 
 And I've never heard of anything like this before. 
 They're calling it a state-of-the-art  life management system. 
 Yeah, but can it find me a woman  who wants me for my mind? 
 Come on. 
 ...spiritual needs. 
 ♪ After all these years of loving you ♪  
 Coming soon. 
 A future that puts its faith in you. 
 With SHARD. 
 Where the f*ck have you been? 
 And a very good morning to you, fair Cordelia. 
 You totally dropped off the grid. 
 Yeah, I know that's what you do,  but you did it to me, whose job it is  to know where the f*ck you are. 
 It's for your own good. 
 If you're hungry, order to go. 
 We gotta be in Chicago by tonight. 
 It's imperative. 
 Jesus, you look like sh1t. 
 When was the last time you slept? 
 I'll sleep... when I'm dead. 
 *AMERICAN GODS* Season 03 Episode 01  Episode Title: "WThe Lake Effect" Aired on: March 14, 2021  ♪ Down in Caroline ♪  Heads or tails? 
 Cut it out. 
 I think you would have said... 
 tails. 
 So I'm gonna say heads. 
 Oh, oh, oh. 
 I'm very happy for you with your lucky powers or whatever... 
 Mm, you're not. 
 But go on. 
 But I have much more important sh1t to think about  than what you plan to do with my f*cking coin. 
 You do have a plan for that, I assume? 
 Stabbing a god? 
 Yup. 
 Get spear, shank shithead. 
 Pull off at the next exit. 
 Why? 
 So we can find a place for me to teach you  how to use the f*cking spear. 
 This is the god-killer. 
 And it doesn't exactly come with an instruction manual. 
 You want me to teach you or not? 
 Oh, hi, Mike! 
 Starting to feel like summer, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 How you doing, Mike? 
 It's been awhile. 
 Mike. 
 Hey. 
 I was hoping we could talk. 
 I, uh... 
 I got a call. 
 Uh, something happened. 
 He was such a good boy. 
 You'll be the first person I talk to. 
 Just... 
 give me some time to sort this out. 
 Of course. 
 You okay? 
 Not really. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 He was doing good in therapy. 
 Hadn't missed a day of school or work. 
 Till today. 
 Chief. 
 Need you to see something. 
 Alison McGovern's coat, chief. 
 Found it in the back of the kid's closet. 
 Well... 
 I've gotta go away on an important business trip,  but, uh,  you're in good hands. 
 When I get back... 
 we'll go somewhere,  have some fun. 
 Just you and me. 
 Would you like that? 
 I wonder if you can help me. 
 About something called  Artifact Number 1. 
 Hey, you got a minute? 
 Not really. 
 Look, we really need to talk about this. 
 I mean, I knew Derek. 
 In the way that everyone here knows everyone,  which is not as well as we think, it seems. 
 Look, I have to get back to the office. 
 Maybe we'll see each other later at the Ice Festival? 
 Shouldn't they postpone that or something? 
 They floated cancelling it  at the emergency city council meeting,  but as Hinzelmann made everyone keenly aware,  the kids wait for this all year, so... 
 Everyone's gonna put on their brave face  and carry on like everything's normal. 
 Wait. 
 Derek, he... 
 He couldn't have killed Alison. 
 Something else is going on. 
 - Like what? 
 - I don't know. 
 I just don't think it was Derek! 
 It just doesn't make any sense! 
 Things just don't add up with the kids in this town. 
 You got Derek, Alison. 
 Sandy. 
 What about Sandy? 
 I went to Florida and I spoke to Darren. 
 You did what? 
 - I just thought that, that he... 
 - I can't believe you did this! 
 I only did it so that you would have peace of mind  and you would know how he was doing. 
 But Sandy never went to live with his father. 
 I-I don't even think he ran away. 
 And the only reason he's not responding  to your messages and cards is because he is missing. 
 Like Alison. 
 You deserve the truth. 
 The truth, whatever it is,  doesn't get me out of bed in the morning. 
 It doesn't do my job. 
 It doesn't take Leon to school  or hockey practice or sleepovers! 
 So don't f*cking preach to me about the truth! 
 I just... 
 I'm trying to say... 
 You ready to try? 
 Yeah, I think I got it. 
 I've done my share of pub crawls. 
 It's like a big dart. 
 That, um... 
 ...is actually a very good way to think about it. 
 Except this thing weighs about as much as you. 
 Oh. 
 The first thing you need to do  is find the balance point. 
 Don't manhandle it. 
 And back about a hand's width. 
 Line up to the target. 
 Do you really have to kill this dude? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Either I go out trying to kill him,  or I die breaking my word to the tech Nazis. 
 But with them it's not just my life on the line,  cause I f*cking dragged  Salim and Shadow's names into it as well. 
 So, yeah, there's really no rethinking things. 
 It's really not your problem, though. 
 I mean, if you leave now,  you can be at the craps tables in Vegas by morning. 
 I can figure this out. 
 Take the coin and you can't miss. 
 Don't f*ck with me. 
 Take it. 
 It's a loan. 
 Oh, f*ck me. 
 Votan, you know that sh1t will kill you. 
 As there is no evening star to greet me  with backhanded hospitality,  I let myself in,  sent my girl Friday to the roof,  and told her that there would be a goddess  who has a fondness for kissing my employees. 
 Yeah, whatever, Votan. 
 I'm not in the mood. 
 I'm tired, I'm going to bed. 
 So, can we talk about your war tomorrow morning? 
 Peace. 
 It's peace that we need to talk about. 
 Peace? 
 My war campaign has been a dismal failure. 
 The New Gods won before we started. 
 We have to face that. 
 Are you drunk? 
 I have never been more sober in my life, old friend. 
 It's time. 
 You promised us a war! 
 There will never be peace,  not with them! 
 We have to fight! 
 Otherwise, we are forgotten. 
 We won't be forgotten. 
 The few that remain will whisper our names. 
 Votan? 
 f*ck you. 
 f*ck me? 
 Fine. 
 We are the true gods, Votan. 
 There are many faithful out there  who still believes in us. 
 Who will protect them, huh? 
 We can't even protect ourselves. 
 I came here to ask you  to be my second in peace talks. 
 Please? 
 The Votan I know  would never say "please". 
 What's the matter with you? 
 Have you lost your balls somewhere out there? 
 ♪ I know ♪  
 ♪ You won't come back ♪  
 ♪ And I know ♪  
 ♪ That it might be my fault ♪  
 ♪ And I've got a lot to ♪   
 I'm off to the store, Sandy. 
 Mom!  I'm recording. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Listen, don't forget;  You promised to pick up Leon after practice, okay? 
 Hey, Chad! 
 Chad! 
 You got a minute? 
 We both looked Derek in the eye. 
 He wasn't a killer. 
 This is a crime scene now, Mike. 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to step behind the perimeter. 
 Look, there is something else going on. 
 Okay? 
 Something we can't see. 
 Alison was not the only kid  to go missing in this town. 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 I went to Florida,  went to check on Sandy Olsen. 
 He wasn't there. 
 Are you a cop now? 
 Look, wherever Sandy Olsen went,  it has got nothing to do with Alison! 
 Now, I don't remember the last time  there was a dead kid in Lakeside,  but now I've got two of 'em back to back! 
 What if it's three? 
 What if it's more? 
 A lot more. 
 I listened to you about Derek,  and now we're in this mess. 
 So, if you could just please  get behind the goddamn line. 
 Oh, my goodness! 
 Leon, this is incredible. 
 Gosh, it took me so long to make it. 
 Come here! 
 Like this part right here. 
 That part was crazy. 
 Mike, you look like a fly fisher who's off the bite. 
 Yeah. 
 Just came from Derek's. 
 Oh, yes, so tragic. 
 No need to let that sad affair  ruin our lovely festival. 
 I mean, have you ever seen a more perfect bonfire? 
 Surviving winter in Lakeside  is no small feat. 
 We aren't just celebrating the end of winter. 
 We're celebrating our good fortune. 
 Oh, Ann-Marie! 
 Olga! 
 The trunk. 
 No, no! 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Ah! 
 Well, thanks for the f*cking help. 
 Little bit distracted. 
 I only have to kill a literal god tomorrow. 
 You'll be fine. 
 You have the coin. 
 Yeah, well, perfect plans are not always perfect  where Wednesday is involved, so... 
 Um, I might die tomorrow. 
 And I would really like to feel something before I go. 
 I just wanna feel... wanted? 
 I just wanna be, like,  pushed up against a f*cking wall  and feel somebody wanting me. 
 Maybe for the last time, ever. 
 So, do you think maybe you could help me out? 
 Actually, um... 
 I used to do this a lot. 
 I would find someone to have s*x with  when I was anxious or... or bored. 
 And it's not... 
 It's not good. 
 Uh, we shouldn't... 
 We shouldn't do... 
 I'm sorry. 
 We should definitely not do that. 
 Just as I was getting used to the idea. 
 I mean, it's nothing to do with you. 
 You're... you're fine. 
 I'm fine? 
 Yeah, you're fine. 
 You're... f*cking attractive. 
 Is that what you want me to say? 
 You're very attractive. 
 It's... 
 Now that I'm alive again, I just... 
 I mean, the last time that I had real,  like, actual alive s*x was... 
 ...was Robbie. 
 That's not good. 
 And that's why we definitely  should not... not do that. 
 Does it matter what I think? 
 I think what you need is a plan  for what comes next. 
 When you're done with Wednesday,  and you aren't dead. 
 When I was a kid, I, uh,  I used to sit in a pew just like that. 
 And I would pray for God to be real,  and magic,  and I would pray that I was special. 
 And the thing about all of that sh1t,  f*ckin' religion, fate, destiny, whatever,  is that it's not real  and it's actually just a f*cking cage. 
 It's, like, shackles. 
 And I just... 
 I just wanna be free. 
 Has anyone ever told you that you're very cynical  and more than slightly overdramatic? 
 And I'm not talking about destiny. 
 I meant you need a challenge. 
 Like bowling. 
 Like bowling? 
 Ugly shirts. 
 Greasy pizza. 
 Let's go tomorrow. 
 You're all wound up about this one thing. 
 There has to be life after. 
 It doesn't have to be bowling. 
 We could get tattoos. 
 Or go skydiving. 
 Well, I've never been skydiving. 
 Great. 
 You stick the All-Father with the magic spear,  then I get my coin. 
 Then, we skydive. 
 Ha. 
 Okay, cool. 
 Let's do it.

 I don't know what to do. 
 Why should I join you in that endless eternity? 
 Huh? 
 Be with you forever. 
 I don't know. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 You want me to become the Dark One  once again, huh? 
 Ah, Zorya. 
 Please talk to me. 
 I need you to guide me. 
 Zorya. 
 Zorya. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Let him work it out. 
 Um, he's doing that? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You know, I'm sensing a pattern here. 
 We drop in on old friends of yours,  they hate your guts and freak out. 
 You e-eat their food and drink their booze  until they calm down. 
 You ever worried that one day it won't work? 
 We leave in the morning. 
 After I wake up. 
 A big mistake people make with hypothermia  is wrapping a fellow in blankets right away. 
 Especially in wet clothes. 
 A hot bath... 
 that's what sailors have done for hundreds of years. 
 Come on. 
 Warms you up from the inside. 
 Given how long you were underwater,  you should be a dead man. 
 And your luck doesn't stop there. 
 You won the clunker competition! 
 7:25 pm. 
 Just like you guessed. 
 You must have some powerful guardians looking after you. 
 You killed them. 
 All of 'em. 
 You put the clunker on the ice every year. 
 You knew to frame Derek for killing Alison because of me. 
 You have to understand,  they are a necessary sacrifice  in accordance with Norse tradition. 
 Just one child every few years to give  thousands of townsfolk a lifetime of prosperity. 
 You know anyone here could put the pieces together  if they wanted to. 
 But they don't. 
 They don't wanna know the price. 
 And you don't have to burden them with it. 
 The world is a dark and dangerous place. 
 I provide shelter from the storm. 
 Forget what you saw today. 
 You can have a wonderful life here. 
 Safe and happy and loved. 
 I'm not gonna let you just keep doing this. 
 I knew this would happen the moment you arrived. 
 But I owed Wednesday a debt,  and he came to collect. 
 And you know your father. 
 Truly, I'm more of a benevolent spirit. 
 But they made sacrifices in my name,  and now, I have to deliver. 
 That's enough, Ann-Marie. 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 Put your hands behind your head! 
 Stop! 
 Jesus Christ. 
 What the... 
 I shot her. 
 What... 
 All cultures impose their own meaning on the heavens. 
 Look at these stars, huh? 
 Probably the most famous stars in the world. 
 You probably know them as... 
 what? 
 The Big Dipper. 
 Other cultures know them as Ursa Major. 
 Others as Favdna's Bow and Arrow. 
 Some as the Seven Gods. 
 Personally, I prefer Odin's Wain. 
 Or do I? 
 The stars:  Frontier to the future and map to the past. 
 That's why this is a perfect place  to bring it all to an end. 
 It's an end for you and me too, kid. 
 All good things must, huh? 
 Are you gonna be able  to take care of yourself without me? 
 You sure you've got that the right way around? 
 Where can we hide in the fair weather,  we orphans of the storm? 
 Evelyn Waugh. 
 Okay. 
 The assholes are here now. 
 I hear you've been trying out a few new looks. 
 Well, variety is the spice of life. 
 Well, I like the Savile Row psycho look. 
 It suits you. 
 I don't care if you can make yourself  look like the f*cking Princess Anastasia. 
 Now, can we get this the f*ck over with? 
 Thank you for agreeing to the meeting, Mr. 
 World. 
 You must be very busy. 
 It was an intriguing invitation. 
 I've come to a realization that affects both of us. 
 War and bloodshed do both of us harm. 
 We fight amongst ourselves, we demean godhood itself. 
 But if we work together... 
 I'm sorry if there's been a misunderstanding, but, uh,  we will dictate the terms. 
 Our offer to the Old Gods... 
 is their lives... 
 and freedom... 
 to disappear  in any corner of America they choose. 
 That's an offer? 
 Here is the alternative. 
 SHARD. 
 We're on the cusp of a new age,  wherein humanity will forget the Old Gods! 
 And... and you'll all die. 
 Now, you can accept my offer  and fade from existence in peace. 
 Or we will systematically  hunt and kill  every one of you that gets in our way. 
 You're not gonna say anything? 
 Votan! 
 What are you afraid of? 
 I'm not afraid anymore, Votan, no, no, no. 
 I will fight until the bitter end. 
 With or without you. 
 And I will call upon the Old Gods to join me. 
 Peace talks are over for today. 
 Mr. Wednesday. 
 About two years ago,  around Christmas, Darren called me... 
 ...screaming about visitation,  I was keeping the kids from him,  when were they coming? 
 He was drunk, and uh... 
 I got mad, and I told him  that he would never see the kids. 
 Sandy heard everything. 
 So when he took off,  I just thought he went to go live with his dad, but... 
 As time went on, I... 
 I chose to believe it. 
 I had to. 
 Where you headed? 
 I've got a friend at the Journal-Sentinel  in Milwaukee, and, uh,  she's been trying to convince me for years  to work for her, so... 
 You know, I like Milwaukee. 
 There's a great bookstore... 
 on the East Side, on... 
 on Murray. 
 Maybe... 
 if you ever find yourself there... 
 Yeah. 
 Count on it. 
 My car is yours. 
 Just... 
 keep it purple. 
 Hey, fucker!
