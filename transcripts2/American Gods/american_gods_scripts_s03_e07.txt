 Chad's willing to make you a deal. 
 [sighing] 
 Back in my country, I was an excellent businessman. 
 Allow me to negotiate the terms and conditions. 
 Um, just out of curiosity,  were assassination attempts your speciality? 
 No, of course not, but in Oman,  a verbal contract is binding. 
 And from everything I've seen here,  it's the same with gods. 
 Once the terms are set, they can't be undone. 
 Now is not the time to be impulsive. 
 Impulsive? 
 Because I know what I want? 
 This is not Oman, Salim. 
 In America, women can drive cars. 
 They even let us vote,  and some of us can negotiate our own f*ckin' deals. 
 Women can do all those things in Oman! 
 And you know me well enough to understand  this is not what I mean by impulsive. 
 I value our friendship. 
 I care about your well-being.

 Slow down. 
 Why'd he send you here? 
 What... 
 Safe from what?

 I mean, what the f*ck? 
 All right, um... 
 Look, I'm not asking if he's crazy.

 Furthermore, once the target  has been eliminated, you, your allies,  officiates, and surrogates shall furnish  24-hour protection for her  from any and all parties  seeking retribution or retaliation. 
 Not a problem. 
 Upon completion of the assignment,  my client will have no further obligation to you,  your successors, heirs, or assignees.

 We will need these terms and conditions memorialized  in a document binding on both parties. 
 Agreed and accepted.

 What's goin' on? 
 Some blood-craving berserker,  who was once signed to protect me,  has lost whatever his last tenuous grip was on reality,  and, I don't know, due to psychedelics,  brain fever, the curse of Fu Manchu,  who knows anyway,  lately, he's taken to slaughtering my followers. 
 It's fine.
