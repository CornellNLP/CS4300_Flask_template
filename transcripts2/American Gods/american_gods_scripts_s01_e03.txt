 Shadow: I think I'm losing my mind. 
 Hello, Shadow. 
 Wednesday: There are bigger sacrifices one might be asked to make than going a little mad. 
 Shadow: What's in Chicago? 
 The hammer. 
 If I lose, I will go with Votan and do what he ask... 
 Shadow: And if you win? 
 I get to knock your brains out with my hammer.

 No, it's too early to fry the onions. 
 Assaf likes them crisp. 
 No, no, it's not perfect. 
 More cinnamon.

 Assaf? 
 I told you no come before 5! 
 And no more bringing me your laundry! 
 I tell you I am done being your maid-- You are in wrong floor. 
 Black people family is upstairs. 
 No mistake. 
 You are to come with me, Mrs.

 You have died, Mrs.

 And it is time for you to come with me. 
 I have company soon. 
 If you are here to rob, then rob. 
 There is a television, and I-- I have a phone my grandson says is also a camera. 
 I wish I was but a thief. 
 I am not. 
 I am of Death. 
 You are dead, Mrs. 
 Fadil. 
 - That is me? 
 - That is you. 
 Your family will come soon and find you. 
 They will do right by your body and bury you as is proper. 
 They will be sad for a time, then they will find happiness again. 
 Your Assaf will marry in a year and name his first daughter for you. 
 A bullshit middle name? 
 - A bullshit middle name. 
 - [scoffs] 
 This is how they will find me? 
 This is a Muslim home. 
 Why does Anubis hold out his hand for me? 
 It is my thanks. 
 You were once a girl with your own Tita. 
 Who taught you the ways of Egypt old, of when the Nile was full and flooding. 
 She told you stories of the Wolf and the Jackal, the Red Wind, and of the Child of Bast. 
 - I remember. 
 - You do. 
 For that, I bring you to the Scales. 
 Come. 
 My family will find me. 
 They will not try it.

 I am Zorya Polunochnyaya, yes. 
 And you are called Shadow. 
 What are you looking at up there? 
 I was looking at that. 
 See? 
 The Big Dipper? 
 Odin's Wain, they call it. 
 And the Great Bear. 
 It is a thing. 
 It's not a god. 
 Like a god. 
 It's a bad thing.

 If it escapes, it will eat the whole of everything.

 You're not cold? 
 Cold doesn't bother me. 
 This time is my time. 
 My sisters, they're of their times. 
 When is your time? 
 Your birthday? 
 No, I-- I don't want my fortune told. 
 My fortunes are the best. 
 Virgins have the advantage. 
 And now we have something. 
 Oh. 
 No. 
 You have nothing. 
 You believe in nothing so you have nothing. 
 You are on a path... 
 from nothing to everything. 
 You had something recently. 
 You lost it. 
 - My-- my wife. 
 - Not your wife. 
 Did you sell your head to Czernobog? 
 Yeah. 
 You keep giving away your life. 
 You don't much care if you live or die, do you? 
 The world's not what I thought it would be. 
 You'd rather die than live in a world with bears in the sky. 
 I can help you. 
 - First, you must do something for me. 
 - What is it? 
 Gotta fight you? 
 Play checkers? 
 You have to kiss me. 
 I have not ever been kissed. 
 I don't know if I like it. 
 We do this now. 
 I-- Kissing is disgusting... 
 but-- but in a nice way, like, uh, bleu cheese or brandy. 
 Take the moon. 
 What? 
 Just take it. 
 Here. 
 Don't lose this. 
 Don't give it away. 
 You've been given protection once. 
 You had the sun itself. 
 I can give you the moon. 
 It's the daughter, not the father. 
 Now... 
 you wake up. 
 Is not sunrise yet. 
 Enjoy your time. 
 How about another game? 
 Same terms. 
 How can be same? 
 You want me to kill you twice? 
 [chuckles] 
 Right now you only have one blow. 
 One is all it takes. 
 That is... 
 the art. 
 How long has it been... 
 since you last swung a killing hammer in the stockyards, though? 
 It's gotta be, like, what, twenty years? 
 Thirty? 
 I think you got used to the bolt gun. 
 I think you got weak, and I don't think you can kill me with one shot. 
 You could just leave me brain damaged, a drooling piss bag reminder that you got old. 
 That's not gonna do either of us any good, is it? 
 If you're gonna smash my brains in, I'd rather you finish the job. 
 I win, you come with me and Mister Wednesday, you'll still take your shot when we're through. 
 But you win... 
 come sunrise, you'll take your second swing, if you need it. 
 - No one needs to know but me.

 Okay. 
 Another game. 
 You are light, I'm dark. 
 [knocking on door] 
 Enough visiting. 
 Go to bed. 
 I'm trying to. 
 You deserve better than this. 
 You no like it, you sleep on floor. 
 Is good enough for me. 
 You only learned to live with less. 
 There is food, there is roof. 
 What more do you need? 
 A court to adore you. 
 [kisses] 
 In the old country, you were draped with pearl, loved, feared, waited upon. 
 Excess suits you. 
 Things will be better again soon enough. 
 [thunder crashes] 
 Ah. 
 Your turn. 
 Ah. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Bye-bye. 
 In old country, I opened the gate for my father at dusk when he returned to us, then climb into black satin sheet. 
 Here, I tell pretty fortune for dollars. 
 Now, you've never told me mine. 
 This thing you want to do. 
 You will fail. 
 And they will win. 
 That's only my fortune today. 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 Come. 
 Walk with me, hmm? 
 It will rain now. 
 Boy, will it ever. 
 Since when were you afraid of getting a little wet, hmm? 
 You're playing the same game, old man. 
 Only get to fool me once. 
 Shut your mouth. 
 Still so beautiful. 
 I thought I told the pretty lies. 
 You want fortune or you want truth. 
 Oh, I want knowledge over comfort, over all things, always. 
 They will kill you this time. 
 Ahh...

 once swore that she had seen an ifrit, or perhaps a marid, late one evening, on the edge of the desert.

 No.

 I had to clean wet sh1t from that seat.

 They're her sins. 
 Why should Jesus do all the suffering? 
 'Cause his dad sacrificed his ass. 
 Don't blame the parent. 
 Plenty of suffering and blame to go around, although that White Jesus, well, could stand a little more suffering. 
 He's doing very well for himself these days. 
 And how many colors does Jesus come in? 
 Why, you got your White Jesuit-style Jesus.

 Can't rob a bank on an empty stomach. 
 No, I'm not hungry. 
 Who says you have to be hungry to eat? 
 Wasn't supposed to snow today. 
 Wasn't even supposed to be cold. 
 So, you're perfectly okay believing that tiny people on television can predict the weather, but you crinkle with consternation at the mere suggestion that you could make it snow. 
 One of those things is science, okay? 
 The other is fantasy. 
 You're talking about it like it's apples and oranges. 
 It's not apples and oranges, okay? 
 It's reality and fantasy. 
 Oh, so that's how the world works! 
 It's either real or it's fantasy? 
 Yeah, that's how the world works.

 He has a point. 
 I gave you the wrong coin. 
 The one I gave you was my lucky coin. 
 Well, you can't afford to be too careless with a lucky coin. 
 Something like that, you wanna hang on to. 
 Tell you what, I'll give you your lucky coin back when you tell me how you plucked it out of thin air. 
 I plucked it outta thin air is how I plucked it outta thin air, ya bug-eatin' nonce. 
 Now give me my coin. 
 I threw it away. 
 Where did you throw it away? 
 Eagle Point, Indiana. 
 So, if you want your lucky coin back, make your way to Parkview Cemetery. 
 There you will find my wife's grave with your coin on top. 
 Oh, you fucker. 
 Suppose I'll just be one more in a long line of men to climb on top of your dead wife. 
 Be nice.

 Good luck, Mad Sweeney. 
 I'll see you back at the car. 
 Just make sure he doesn't steal it, huh? 
 Now, you're gonna do a little light shopping at the grocery store. 
 Pass a little time at the phone booth.

 Wednesday: This is the only country in the world that wonders what it is. 
 You've been to a lot of other countries, have you? 
 No. 
 No, never, just this one. 
 Just that the others know what they are. 
 I mean, no one wonders about the heart of Norway or goes searching for the soul of Mozambique. 
 Mozambique knows what it is. 
 They all know what they are. 
 Americans know who they are. 
 They pretend they know. 
 But it's still just pretending, like I'm pretending now. 
 Just like you. 
 What am I pretending? 
 You are pretending you cannot believe in impossible things. 
 Uh, I'd be genuinely deluded if I believed that sh1t. 
 If you are deluded, I believe it's genuine. 
 You don't strike me as the disingenuous type. 
 Wednesday: Okay, let's go. 
 Huh? 
 Did I make snow? 
 Did you make snow? 
 Well, if you choose to believe you made snow, then you get to live the rest of your life believing that you can do things that are impossible. 
 Or you can believe it's a delusion. 
 No, see, delusions feel real, okay? 
 That's why it's a delusion. 
 None of this feels real. 
 It feels like a dream. 
 What a beautiful, beautiful thing to be able to dream when you're not asleep. 
 I've-- I've crossed enough paths to know that one in four people are rock stupid. 
 Even the smart ones have got some kind of delusion they believe in, whether it's gods or ghosts. 
 Do you believe in love? 
 Yeah, I believe the sh1t out of love. 
 Did you always? 
 Not before Laura. 
 So you didn't believe till you did, and then the world changed because you believed. 
 Belief is only a product of the company we keep and how easily we scare. 
 And you do not scare easily. 
 And my company is questionable. 
 Always has been. 
 The only thing that scares me is being forgotten. 
 I can survive most things but not that. 
 Very best part of memory is it's mostly about forgetting. 
 We remember what's important to us. 
 I wonder what'll be the first thing that drifts through your mind when you look back on this evening? 
 Snow, I bet.
