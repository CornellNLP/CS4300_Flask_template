 Previously on  Tyrant... 
 (gasping) 
 The baby didn't make it, and we had to perform a hysterectomy. 
 No more children. 
 Leila : The people of Abuddin need an heir. 
 You'll tell him you want the marriage annulled. 
 You have to trust someone on the ground inside Ma'an. 
 Right now, you have no one. 
 I want to trust you, but I need something reliable. 
 A Caliphate target. 
 Abu Omar is arresting five families. 
 Christian and other minorities he thinks are supporting you. 
 When's it happening? 
 Tonight. 
 I put my neck on the line to get you on this. 
 Barry : He's alive. 
 Rami :  Khalil... he's the break we've been waiting for. 
 Before I involved you, I had to test him. 
 That decision was mine, not yours. 
 This man, Khalil... I want to talk to him myself. 
 I mean, I can't. 
 Why? Move on. 
 Sammy : There's a man inside Ma'an who's fighting the Caliphate, and I'm giving him my money. 
 ♪ 
 (ringtone playing) 
 (gasps) 
 Sammy? 
 Barry : Molly... it's Barry. 
 It's me, Molly. It's Barry. 
 No. 
 That's not possible. 
 Molly... 
 Molly, I need to talk to you. 
 There are things I need to tell you. 
 Molly, you there? 
 Molly? 
 Molly? 
 (gasps) 
 (TV playing quietly) 
 Good morning. 
 I'm worried about you, Jamal. 
 You never came to bed last night. 
 (groans) 
 Did I tell you the sheik told me the real threat... the poison... was inside the palace? 
 I don't know what you're talking about, and I'm not sure you know what you're talking about. 
 (clears throat) Rami, my son... he had the chance to destroy the Caliphate leadership, but he didn't take it. 
 Could be him. 
 That son of yours is a professional. 
 You wanted him here. 
 He is here to help you. 
 He is sneaking around like Tariq. 
 He's not telling me things. 
 I can't have it. 
 Not again. 
 Ahmed : Pick a country. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Ah, pick a country, any country, any spot on Earth, and we'll go. 
 For two weeks, a month, as long as it takes to heal. 
 To smile. 
 Just the two of us. 
 Ahmed, that's not going to happen. 
 I know there's a war, but I have great faith in my stepbrother. 
 He'll wrap this up quickly, and as soon as it's done... 
 (sniffs) 
 ...we should go someplace. 
 Ahmed, we need to get our marriage annulled. 
 (clears throat) 
 What are you talking about? 
 I can't have a baby. 
 And you have to have a baby. 
 No. 
 I don't have to have anything. 
 I have to take care of you. 
 That's the only thing I have to have. 
 You're not being honest with yourself. 
 You need to find someone who can give you a child. 
 But we love each other, and I don't care if I have a child, as long as I have you. 
 But your parents. 
 What are they going to do? 
 Disown me? 
 They might. 
 Then let them. 
 I'll get a job. 
 I'll find a way to support us. 
 I love you. 
 And I'm willing to fight for you. 
 I don't want you to fight for me. 
 I just... 
 I just want it to be over. 
 Really. 
 In three nights time, the meteorological service is predicting a likely sandstorm in Ma'an. 
 It will provide perfect cover for us. 
 Planes cannot take off or land. 
 Cars and tanks are largely crippled. 
 Rami : Based on the current weather models, the storm is likely to last two to three hours. 
 Mm. 
 In those two to three hours, if we can take out the Caliphate's antiaircraft capability, the second the storm lifts, we can fly in troops and equipment and commence bombing runs to support our ground forces. 
 Now... given the size of the force that Solomon and I have assembled, Ma'an should be ours within a week. 
 Well, excellent. 
 Hopefully, God is on our side once again. 
 Brilliant. 
 The key to this, of course, is getting Khalil and his Red Hand Brigade onboard. 
 They're already in Ma'an, and they're the logical choice to take out the antiaircraft guns during the storm. 
 So if you just share his number with me, I'll give him a call. 
 Share his number? 
 (chuckles) 
 Is something wrong, Mr. President? 
 Yes. 
 Lately, when I leave planning to others, things go badly. 
 I and only I will speak to Khalil. 
 Don't look so sad. 
 If it's God's will, it will happen. 
 (woman crying softly) 
 Ihab :  Praise to God  that you did not get hurt too badly yesterday. 
 So many of your comrades lost their lives. 
 You must feel blessed. 
 Huh? 
 (whispers): Yeah. 
 Tell me, to what, uh, do you think you owe this great good luck? 
 Timing, I guess. 
 Timing? 
 Timing, yes. 
 Timing is everything. 
 Well, timing and information. 
 Knowing what is going to happen before it happens. 
 That is... that is the ultimate good luck. 
 Isn't it? 
 So, you helped, uh, with the mission yesterday. 
 So you knew which families, which houses, were going to be visited and at what time. 
 Apparently, so did the Red Hand. 
 Apparently? 
 The night... 
 I don't... I-I don't know. that my wife was murdered, your father's youngest wife escaped. 
 You knew where they were being held. 
 You also knew that no one else was there, and apparently so did the Red Hand. 
 No. No. No, no, no, no, no. 
 Everyone knew she was at Abu Omar's. 
 Hmm. 
 Everyone knew his brother was visiting and you would all be at a huge dinner in his honor. 
 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
 Everyone knew that. 
 The night the Red Hand invaded our prisons, how did they know how to get in? 
 How did they know how to get out? 
 I-I have no idea. I don't know. I... 
 Maybe, maybe... someone had a relative... perhaps a brother... who worked at the prison and could offer insight into vulnerabilities and such. 
 (gulps) No. 
 No. 
 I would never ask my brother such a thing. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And he would never... 
 (sighs) 
 He would never... what? 
 Good morning. 
 Hey. 
 Have you been smoking? 
 (sighs) Mm-hmm. 
 Did you get word from Sammy? 
 Uh, yeah, I did. 
 He's still in Ma'an, staying in Ma'an. 
 He's decided to fight with the resistance. 
 That's crazy. 
 You must be out of your mind with worry. 
 Why didn't you wake me? 
 No, it's fine. I'm fine. 
 I'm... 
 I'm calling the State Department. 
 No. They can't do anything. 
 They won't do anything. 
 They can't do anything, James. 
 Besides, I think you should pack. 
 You're not serious. 
 W-We're not... we're not actually leaving? 
 No, not me. 
 But I think you should. 
 No. 
 I mean, not if you're still here. 
 Not if Sammy's still here. 
 Look, I need to be here as long as it takes. 
 Okay, I do, too, then. 
 That's the thing, you don't. 
 You don't. 
 (sighs) 
 James, I'm sorry. 
 You're not family. 
 I think you're amazing. 
 I'm beyond grateful for everything you've done for me. 
 But right now, there's just no room left in my brain for anything but waiting for my son to come back so I can take him home. 
 And you don't want me to stick around? 
 Keep you company? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know you're not making any sense. 
 Well, I'm making sense to me. 
 (sighs) 
 If you're trying to get rid of me, this is not the way. 
 I'll call you every day. 
 No. 
 Text, e-mail, carrier pigeon. 
 Please don't. 
 I really like you. 
 Maybe you should stop. 
 Okay. 
 I guess I'm going back to my room to pack. 
 So you haven't heard anything? 
 Well, I-I don't even know if he's made the call yet. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 Every hour is precious. 
 That sandstorm is going to come and go. 
 And once it is gone, we have lost our window. 
 I need a way to reach out to Khalil directly. 
 I know you have his number. 
 You need to give it to me. 
 Gentlemen... 
 I work at the pleasure of President Al Fayeed. 
 If I defy him, that is an act of treason. 
 It is not an act of treason to want to protect one's country. 
 No, let... let me try and find out if he has connected with Khalil, hmm? 
 And as far as you dealing with him directly... my advice would be to save that discussion for another day. 
 Halima : Yesterday, you told us you were talking to the Palace, hatching a plan to take our city back from the Caliphate. 
 So what is the plan? 
 (others murmuring) 
 Barry : I understand your frustration. 
 It has been difficult to get to the right people. 
 But I have faith, every faith that it will all come together soon. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. Let's get back to work. 
 Mr. Al Fayeed. 
 Sammy is fine. 
 Let me show you around. 
 (sighs) 
 Okay, okay. 
 (sighs) 
 You called Mom? 
 Yeah, of course. I had to. 
 I needed her to... to know that you were here, know you were... safe and that I'd do everything I could to keep you safe. 
 Wow. 
 Almost sounds like you care. 
 (clears throat) 
 I'll be honest with you. 
 I don't know where to be right now. 
 She sounded so... scared. 
 Confused. 
 Lonely. 
 She's a mess. 
 So part of me wants to run back to her and make her feel okay, but... that's really your job, isn't it? 
 I don't know where you should be either. 
 I hate that you're here. 
 It terrifies me, but... but I'm also very proud. 
 Don't be. 
 It has absolutely nothing to do with you. 
 Anything else, or, uh... are we all caught up now? 
 (muezzin sounds call to prayer) 
 That's the call to prayer. 
 I know what it is. 
 Join me. 
 We'll wash and pray. 
 I'll show you how. 
 What's up with you and Mom? 
 When we were kids, everybody else was, you know, celebrating Easter and Christmas. 
 We couldn't get you guys near a church. 
 Now, all of a sudden, you two are holy rollers? 
 Mom I get, you know. She lost a husband. But you? 
 Sammy, so much has... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I-I wasn't sure you heard. 
 No, I was just, um, inviting Samuel to join us. 
 I was just politely declining. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 (chanting in Arabic) 
 (phone vibrating) 
 (phone continues vibrating) 
 Hello? 
 Jamal : So... how is my favorite counterrevolutionary? 
 Anxious. 
 I'm glad you called. 
 I'd love to get on the phone with your head of military and start making some concrete plans. 
 Ah. General Said. 
 Well, I'm not so sure about him. 
 I will tell you a secret. 
 He is my son. 
 Imagine that. 
 A child I never knew I had. 
 I was so excited. 
 So proud. 
 He is a man of great accomplishments. 
 Uh, then, um... then what is it that's giving you pause? 
 Well, I went to see a learned man about why God is punishing me. 
 Wait, you think that God is punishing you? 
 Well... it feels like it. 
 (clears throat) 
 Maybe... maybe because I couldn't forgive my brother. 
 And no... no war can be won without the help of God. 
 Mr. President, as wise as you are, you cannot presume to know what God is thinking. 
 Well, it's not me presuming. 
 The sheik told me there is a poison inside the Palace. 
 It could be anyone. 
 (sighs) But you... 
 I trust. 
 (quietly): I don't understand it myself. 
 I think you want to go to war or you don't. 
 But when I look into your father's eyes, I don't see either. 
 There must be something that we can do. 
 I don't know. 
 Hafa, you can go to lunch now. 
 Okay. 
 Here's what we are considering. 
 Uh, from the information I have, three nights from now a sandstorm is predicted in Ma'an, which creates great offensive opportunity for us. 
 Okay, what's your plan? 
 We're still figuring it out. 
 I just wanted to check whether you and your people could take out the antiaircraft battery at the Caliphate-controlled army base. 
 You want us to raid an army base? 
 Mr. President, I have no heavy artillery, no explosives. 
 Many of my fighters, they're very young. 
 That's a tall order without professional support. 
 As I said, we're just still figuring it out. 
 Um... 
 Maybe we... we come up with a different idea. 
 Maybe for now, we don't go to war at all. 
 What if we just give it to them? 
 Give what to who? 
 Give Ma'an to the Caliphate. 
 Think about it. 
 Can we win such a war at this time? 
 Maybe we just let them have it. 
 Mr. President, you can't just let them have it. 
 It's filled with people... your people, people who are counting on you, counting on us. 
 I like talking to you, Khalil. 
 You are very passionate. 
 You have a good heart. 
 But let's talk about Ma'an. 
 It's filled with people, that's right. 
 But who are they? 
 The Rashids? 
 They have always hated the Al Fayeeds. 
 And oil, which I grant you is today's fuel, but not tomorrow's. 
 Let's say it will cost $1 billion to wage this war, then another billion to rebuild after we beat the Caliphate. 
 Will we actually have $2 billion in value down the line? 
 I'm not so sure about that. 
 Forgive me, Khalil, I have to go. 
 No, sir, sir, please. 
 Just let me sit down with the general, with anyone inside your military. 
 We have to agree on a plan. 
 Time is not on our side. 
 No, listen, I will call again tomorrow. 
 In the meantime, please improve upon our plans. 
 You are a warrior. 
 I have great confidence in you. 
 Sir, I am not a warrio... 
 (line clicks) 
 You look like your world's ending. 
 My world is ending. 
 My world here, anyway. 
 Can't decide if it's a blessing or a curse. 
 What do you mean? 
 I'm being banished. 
 To London. 
 To Paris. 
 A city of my choice. 
 A single woman. 
 It's my, uh, in-laws' parting gift for not being able to produce someone to carry on the legacy of this most extraordinary family. 
 What about Ahmed? 
 What about your husband? 
 What happens to him? 
 Ahmed stays here, nurses his, uh, broken heart back to health, and with, uh, luck, finds a loving, fertile partner. 
 He's okay with this? 
 No. 
 And I'm not helping. Turns out, he's willing to give up everything for me. And it's killing him that I'm not willing to give up everything for him. 
 
 
 
 Ihab : Where is the Red Hand Brigade? 
 Hmm? 
 Munir, where do they eat? 
 Where do they sleep? 
 Where do they hide? 
 (gasping) 
 (grunting) 
 (panting) 
 So, I asked you a question. 
 (whimpering): I saved your life. 
 That's all I was trying to do, brother, is save your life. 
 I'm trying to return the favor. 
 Just tell them what they need to know so they can spare yours, Munir. Come on. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Leila : Not now. 
 General Said is here. 
 Tell him the president is indisposed. 
 Actually it's you I'm looking for. 
 Your father is a man of great appetites. 
 Sometimes I need to do what I can to help him reign himself in. 
 Is he sleeping at all? 
 It's hard to actually call it sleep. 
 I put him to bed; he's not moving. 
 As long as he doesn't change color, I'm filled with hope. 
 2:00 in the afternoon. 
 Very presidential. 
 What can I do for you, General? 
 I need a phone number for Khalil of the Red Hand Brigade. 
 And what makes you think I would have such a thing? 
 I'm fairly sure you don't. 
 But I'm also fairly sure that you can get it. 
 Molly :  You know, I was so shocked  by your call the other day. 
 My head was so spinning with Sammy gone and being in a place I despise and suddenly finding out this man that the whole world is mourning and thinks of as some kind of a saint, my husband, has been alive all this time and didn't have the decency to let me know. 
 I forgot to tell you, Barry... how badly you've... you've destroyed me, how badly you've damaged our family and that you're a horrible person. 
 Since you called, I've actually had moments where I found myself wishing you  were  dead. 
 Truly dead. 
 Gone. 
 You got that? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
 Man :  Fire! 
 Man :  Reload! 
 Well, you hold the gun like a girl. 
 Give it to me. 
 You hold the gun like a boy. 
 Eh, I hold the gun like someone who knows their life depends upon holding it correctly. 
 Why are you here? 
 Weren't you just going to give money? 
 You have a problem with me being here? 
 No, I just find it interesting. 
 This isn't even your home. 
 I'm from here. 
 Father was. 
 And I thought hating the Caliphate was the only requirement. 
 Man :  Get set! 
 Man :  Ready! Aim! 
 Man : Fire! 
 Man :  Reload! 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 How did I make my bullet go through the exact same hole that yours did? 
 Man :  Into positions! 
 It's okay to laugh. 
 Life's already awful enough. 
 Man :  Weapons ready! 
 Fire! 
 (water running) 
 Jamal : Leila. 
 (water stops) 
 What is it, Jamal? 
 (sighs) 
 I had a nightmare. 
 I was in the ocean. 
 Uh, I developed a cramp. 
 I couldn't swim, couldn't keep my head above water. 
 And then the tide started to carry me away. 
 And you were standing on the shore, watching. 
 And you wouldn't jump in to save me. 
 Just watching, as I was drawn deeper and deeper into the ocean. 
 That's a ridiculous dream. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You've been drinking too much. 
 Too many pills. 
 You left this in the bathroom. 
 Mmm. 
 Look at me. 
 You see me? 
 Mmm. 
 I'm here... to pull you out of the ocean. 
 I will never let you drown. 
 (sighs) 
 (phone vibrating) 
 Hello. 
 Rami : Khalil. 
 This is General Rami Said. 
 What can I do for you, General? 
 I was hoping we could meet this evening, say, 8:30, face-to-face. 
 I've arranged for a private home five miles outside Ma'an. 
 I'll send you the address. 
 Brother, I... 
 I know you're... you're cold and hungry. 
 I-I brought you food and water. 
 All you have to do is walk over to that map and show us the location of the Red Hand headquarters. 
 That's it. 
 But I do not know. 
 How would I know? 
 Munir, I beg of you. 
 I've explained to everyone that you have made a mistake, that you were tricked. 
 Your-your friends in the Red Hand, they were taking advantage of you. 
 I have no friends in the Red Hand. 
 My only friend is you, Kasim. 
 My brother. 
 (sniffles) 
 My big brother. 
 Ihab : Well, it was very nice. 
 It was touching. 
 (gun cocks) 
 I'm going to count to three, then I'm going to shoot your brother's nose off. 
 If you still don't get up, walk over to that map, I'm going to blow his ears off. 
 And if, and if you still do not move, I'm going to shoot out his eyes. 
 One. 
 (sniffling) 
 Two. 
 (chattering) 
 Man :  Me too, please. 
 Man #2 :  Time is up. 
 What's going on? 
 There's a rumor Khalil has a meeting with the military to make war plans, that the fight is about to begin. 
 (chanting): The Caliphate, we will decimate. 
 All : The Caliphate, we will decimate. 
 The Caliphate, we will decimate. 
 The Caliphate, we will decimate! 
 (cheering, whooping) 
 The Caliphate, we will decimate! 
 (faster): The Caliphate, we will decimate! 
 The Caliphate, we will decimate! 
 The Caliphate, we will decimate! 
 The Caliphate... 
 I told you you didn't have to come tonight. 
 You've been through a lot. 
 I'm fine. I understand. 
 If he confessed, it would've... 
 He was your brother. 
 He was family. 
 It couldn't have been easy for you to watch him die. 
 Rami : Excellent. 
 And we'll send you back tonight with enough goggles, plastic explosives and munitions to do the job. 
 Just remember, should you speak with the president tomorrow, none of these conversations have taken place. 
 And, please, act impressed should he call and share with you all the particulars we've gone over with you tonight. 
 I know it sounds crazy, but... 
 I understand. 
 (gun clicks) 
 Ru'a : Who is that? 
 Your girlfriend? 
 Not quite. 
 Uh, it's my mother. 
 Do you have a girlfriend? 
 Is one required? 
 Let me see her picture. 
 No... 
 Nah, there-there is no picture, 'cause, uh, there's no her. 
 Is she prettier than me? 
 (sighs) 
 (people screaming, crying) 
 (gunfire in distance) 
 (muffled shouting) 
 (ears ringing) 
 Hurry! 
 (shouting, gunfire continues) 
 Shoot her, Kasim. 
 Shoot her! Shoot! Shoot her! 
 What's wrong with you? 
 (whimpers) 
 What's wrong? 
 What's wrong with you, Kasim? What's wrong? 
 I beg for God's forgiveness. 
 (shouting, gunfire continues) 
 (coughing) 
 (gunfire, explosions continue) 
 (phone chimes) 
 14 messages. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 (men shouting) 
 (shouting fades) 
 (panting softly) 
 Is it over? 
 I don't know. 
 Sounds like it. 
 Sh-Should we move? 
 Not yet. 
 Why'd you do that? 
 Because I got tired of waiting for you to do it. 
 Wait here. 
 (groans softly) 
 (gunfire, men shouting) 
 (gasping, whimpering) 
 What is it, Mahmoud? 
 A thousand apologies, Mr. President, but, uh, my man, uh... the one you asked me to have follow General Said, he just phoned in. 
 Apparently, General Said and Solomon traveled to the outskirts of Ma'an this evening. 
 He is meeting with an armed group of men. 
 "Armed group of men"? 
 Who could that be? 
 (line ringing) 
 Sammy (recorded) : This is Sam I Am. 
 Leave a message if you can. 
 (goats bleating) 
 (line ringing) 
 This is Sam I Am. Leave a message... 
 (phone beeps) 
 (line ringing) 
 This is Sam I Am. Leave a message if you can. 
 (goats bleating) 
 (men murmuring) 
 Man : Yes, sir. 
 General Said! 
 We know where you were. 
 We know what you were doing. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Where was I and what was I doing? 
 I ask the questions. 
 You drove to the outskirts of Ma'an. 
 Who did you meet with? 
 The Caliphate? 
 No, Mr. President. 
 I would not and did not meet with the Caliphate. 
 Are you intoxicated? 
 Um... 
 I'm not intoxicated. 
 And you are being insubordinate. 
 In addition to possibly being a traitor, who conspires against his country. 
 Solomon : Actually, no. 
 He is a patriot trying to conspire with your allies, so maybe, just maybe, you might be able to hold on to your country. 
 You were meeting with the  Red Hand. 
 Making plans to retake Ma'an for you. 
 Day after tomorrow. 
 Just as we discussed. 
 (scoffs) 
 You met with Khalil after I explicitly ordered you not to. 
 You defied me. 
 Yes, I defied you, and you should thank me for it, because this nation is hanging on by a thread. 
 And all you can do is talk about who ordered what and who defied who. 
 For God's sake, you old drunken fool, stand down. 
 Let me do my job, and maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to save yours. 
 "Drunken, old fool." 
 This is how you call your president? 
 This is how you speak to your father? 
 I'm sorry, Father. 
 I seem to have lost your trust somewhere along the way, but I swear to you on the soul of my dead mother that I am on your side. 
 I am your blood. 
 You are the reason I am here. 
 Just let me do this for you. It's going to work. 
 Just stop thwarting me and... let me do this. 
 Fine. 
 The day after tomorrow. 
 Rain hell on the Caliphate. 
 (clears throat) 
 Uh... 
 I want him dead. 
 Sammy! 
 Oh, my God. Sammy. 
 Sammy! Sammy! 
 (phone vibrating and ringing) 
 Molly. Oh, my God, Molly! 
 I don't know where he is! I don't know where he is! 
 He called me, Barry. 
 About 20 minutes ago. 
 He's hiding with some other fighters. 
 He's okay. He's okay. 
 Cuts, bruises... (sniffles) in a state of shock, but he's alive. 
 Talking about how he wants to go back. 
 He wants to... see it through. 
 He wants to go back and fight with you. 
 (voice breaking): And to be honest with you, I don't know what to do. 
 But I wanted you to know he's alive. 
 We're all still alive. 
 All of us. 
 And just so you know... I'm glad you're still alive.
