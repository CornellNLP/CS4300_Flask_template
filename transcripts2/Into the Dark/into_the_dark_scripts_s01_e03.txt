 Hey, would you mind taking our picture? 
 -Um, of course not. 
 -Yeah? 
 Okay, don't miss it. 
 - Cheese! 
 - Cheese! 
 - That's great. 
 - Yeah. 
 Hey, man, thank you so much, dude. 
 -Merry Christmas. 
 -Merry Christmas. 
 Hello! 
 Hi, I'm so sorry,  I'm your next door neighbor  and I think I've locked myself out. 
 Do you mind letting me in? 
 Hi. 
 I'm Wilson. 
 You buzzed me in downstairs. 
 You just moved in? 
 Right. 
 Well, come on. 
 Come on in. 
 Well, thank you. 
 -  Are you thirsty? 
 You look thirsty. 
 I'm all right, thanks. 
 People don't usually let strangers in. 
 You know? 
 It can be dangerous. 
 Well... 
 it can be dangerous being alone too. 
 I was just worrying about being all alone  for Christmas, and poof! 
 You appear. 
 Poof. 
 I'm Red. 
 So, Wilson  from just next door,  are you from around here? 
 I'm not. 
 Well, what brings you to town? 
 I'm not really sure. 
 I'm... 
 starting over, I guess. 
 Blank slate. 
 Are you employed? 
 Sort of. 
 Sort of... 
 I'm an actor, I guess,  so I--I guess I'm acting. 
 An actor! 
 I'm as light as a feather  and happy as an angel. 
 I'm as merry as a schoolgirl  and as giddy as a drunkard. 
 You too? 
 I had my moment. 
 It's long gone now. 
 I have a good feeling about you,  Wilson from just next door. 
 This is your moment. 
 It's not gone for you. 
 "Am I in the presence  of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?"  "I fear you more than any spec--  specter I have seen."  No, that's sh1t. 
 It's f*cking sh1t. 
 Okay, um... 
 "Am I in the presence"  of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come? 
 I fear you more than any specter  I have seen. 
 But as I know your purpose  is to do me good,  I am prepared to bear your company  and do it with a thankful heart. 
 But before I draw nearer  to that stone to which you point,  "answer me one question."  "Are these the shadows"  of the things that will be  or are they the shadows of the things  that may be only? 
 Men's courses will foreshadow  certain ends to which, if persevered in,  they must lead,  but if the courses be departed from,  the ends will change. 
 Say it is thus  with what you show me. 
 Am I that man who lay upon the bed? 
 Am I that man who lay upon the bed? 
 Am I that man who lay... 
 Wilson Klaus? 
 Hi. 
 Your mark, please. 
 It's in the center. 
 Okay. 
 Sorry. 
 Okay. 
 "Am I in the presence of the Ghost of--."  Okay, that's fine, thank you. 
 That--that was the monologue? 
 It's fine. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 I'm... 
 I can do it differently. 
 That won't be necessary. 
 Are you... 
 sure? 
 Raise your arms up. 
 I'm sorry, what? 
 Raise your arms up. 
 - -Okay. 
 - Higher. 
 Now together like a triangle. 
 No, in front of your face. 
 Now out like an offering. 
 A--a what? 
 Like an offering. 
 Now fly like a plane. 
 Turn around. 
 Fly like a plane and turn around. 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 Fly like a plane. 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 Fly like a plane. 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 Fly like a plane. 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 - -Fly like a plane. 
 - Faster! 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 -Fly like a plane. 
 -Faster! 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 -Fly like a plane. 
 -Faster! 
 Raise your arms up, together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering, fly like a plane. 
 All right, all right, all right, that's enough. 
 Stop, stop, stop. 
 He's the guy. 
 Send everyone else home. 
 It's him. 
 Wow. 
 Congratulations. 
 Come with me. 
 So... 
 This is Pooka. 
 What do you think? 
 It's, um... 
 Cute? 
 Come on! 
 This m*therf*cker's more than cute, baby. 
 Come on! 
 This m*therf*cker's more than cute, baby! 
 Right? 
 It's amazing. 
 It's a main feature. 
 He listens to what you say and repeats it. 
 But here's the hook. 
 He's unpredictable. 
 You don't choose what Pooka's gonna record  and repeat, Pooka does. 
 He's got a naughty setting and a nice setting,  but you don't choose what mood he's gonna be in. 
 Pooka does. 
 But you don't choose what mood he's gonna be in. 
 Pooka does. 
 I'm telling you, this thing tested  through the roof. 
 This is gonna rip Christmas a new asshole. 
 I don't understand what this  has to do with me. 
 I'm an actor. 
 Buddy, your life is about to change forever. 
 Buddy, your life is about to change forever. 
 Ooh! 
 Naughty Pooka. 
 Is this thing f*cking amazing  or is this thing f*cking amazing? 
 What do you think? 
 Looks just like the toy. 
 No, no, no, no, other way around. 
 The toy looks like this. 
 This came first. 
 So you want me to wear this? 
 Buddy, I want you to be him. 
 I think there's been a misunderstanding. 
 See, I am a professional actor. 
 That's why you're here. 
 We need somebody who can be  more than just a guy in a suit. 
 We need somebody  who can bring him to life. 
 Without you,  he's nothing. 
 You didn't take my measurements. 
 How did you know it'd fit? 
 Of course it fits! 
 It belongs to you. 
 How does it feel? 
 It feels... 
 okay. 
 Well, okay. 
 Seems like you two were made for each other. 
 Let's see you move around. 
 How do I move? 
 Remember the thing you did in your audition? 
 Try that. 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 And then you fly like a plane. 
 You raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 Fly like a plane. 
 Raise your arms up. 
 Together like a triangle. 
 Out like an offering. 
 And then you fly like a plane. 
 You okay? 
 What's goin' on, man? 
 You okay? 
 What's goin' on? 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Watch it on that, man. 
 We're trying to market this thing to children. 
 Is this too tight for you? 
 What the f*ck kind of test was that? 
 -What do you mean? 
 -Forget about it! 
 Forget about what? 
 I'm not feeling it, okay? 
 Do you want to talk about numbers  before you make your final decision? 
 I feel like you're gonna feel these numbers. 
 There's this, um... 
 There's this anonymity clause. 
 Standard nondisclosure. 
 You don't say who you are,  we don't say who you are. 
 Protects us both. 
 No one'll know it's me? 
 No, never. 
 It's about trust. 
 And, um, everyone else  who promotes these toys,  they sign one of these? 
 What do you mean? 
 The other actors. 
 What other actors? 
 I thought you said this was gonna be huge. 
 Tested through the roof. 
 It's a Santa-in-the-mall thing, right? 
 How many other Pookas are there? 
 Wilson,  this is all you, okay? 
 One Pooka, one you. 
 This is a dream. 
 Yes, yes! 
 Corporate is gonna love you, so... 
 get comfortable,  take the rest of the day off. 
 Here you go! 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 And nothing's missing,  nothing at all? 
 No. 
 Do you have an idea how they got in? 
 The door was locked, the windows were closed. 
 I have no idea. 
 I'm telling you, darling,  you should call the police. 
 Nothing was stolen. 
 Well... 
 a lot was broken that you can't un-break. 
 Has this ever happened  in this building before? 
 First time I can remember. 
 It's a rather quiet place. 
 Well... 
 I'll borrow a vacuum tomorrow  from one of the neighbors  for any bits of glass  that we've missed. 
 Meanwhile, you keep your shoes on inside. 
 Relax, love. 
 I know, break-ins can be scary. 
 They make you feel scared  in your own home,  but no one is coming back. 
 It's over. 
 Boom. 
 It's beautiful, Wilson. 
 That way you won't feel alone,  even when I'm not here. 
 All right, off to work. 
 What is this new job? 
 You've hardly told me anything about it. 
 It's just this thing in a costume. 
 Trust me, there's nothing interesting about it. 
 I'll see you. 
 He's making a list,  he's checking it twice,  but even Santa won't be able to tell  if this year's new hottest toy  is naughty or nice. 
 Meet Pooka,  a cute, friendly little teddy bear  with a bit of a naughty side. 
 Or is it the other way around? 
 The toy has surprised  even its biggest competitors  and is making waves  with its unusual marketing  and distribution strategy. 
 The company won't say how the toy was conceived,  or how many units have been made,  just that they expect them  to sell out entirely  well before Christmas morning. 
 And get this  If you want one,  there's only one place  you'll be able to get it,  and it's right here behind me  at the Pooka Pop-Up. 
 I love you, Pooka. 
 I love you, Pooka! 
 I like turtles. 
 I like turtles! 
 I like turtles. 
 I like turtles! 
 I like turtles! 
 Okay, everyone. 
 So sorry, sad news,  sad news out of Pooka Town. 
 We are all sold out. 
 Yeah, so we'll be back open  tomorrow at 9 a. m. 
 Come back, we got a lot more Pookas for sale. 
 What's up, man? 
 Cruisin' moms? 
 Give me a second. 
 What are you doing? 
 This didn't come from me. 
 You scared me. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm Wilson. 
 Melanie. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 I, was just hoping  to have a look at the house  if you're not too busy. 
 Of course, I will give you  the official tour. 
 You will be the first. 
 The house was built in '66. 
 It's a mid-century gem. 
 Modern, bright. 
 Filled with tons of light. 
 Four bedroom, four bath  with plenty of communal space  if you need it. 
 Speaking of which,  this is the family room. 
 How long have you been in the market? 
 The--the market? 
 Real estate market. 
 How long you've been looking. 
 Right. 
 Yeah, I'm not sure I am in the market. 
 The--the listing just caught my eye,  I think. 
 You know how you just  see someplace and... 
 you picture yourself living there. 
 I do like to see myself  in all the places that I show. 
 Even the bad ones? 
 There are no bad ones,  only right or wrong fits. 
 That's very good, um,  that's very... professional. 
 Was nicely done. 
 Yeah. 
 So, what do you do? 
 I'm an actor. 
 Nice. 
 Well, it's LA. 
 I'm not much more than a walking cliché. 
 You look familiar. 
 Well, you don't have to say that. 
 No, it's true! 
 Anything I would have seen you in? 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe. 
 So, what do you think of this kitchen? 
 Brand new granite  and Caesarstone countertops,  new appliances,  and the view. 
 Not too bad. 
 You look like you're having a vision. 
 Seeing how this house could be. 
 Yeah. 
 So... 
 I guess this is the living room. 
 Right? 
 Yeah, I'd put a big leather couch  in the corner over there. 
 A... huge piece of art on the wall,  something... modern,  abstract,  strange. 
 Yeah. 
 Someone could... 
 could really make a nice life here. 
 It is kind of big  for one person, you know? 
 Well... 
 Hopefully it won't always be just one. 
 Do you want to make an offer? 
 Maybe. 
 But listen,  I don't normally do this. 
 Um... 
 I swear, but... 
 could I maybe ask you out for dinner? 
 That's a little forward. 
 I know,  but it's not always that you meet someone  that you think might be amazing. 
 It was really nice meeting you, Wilson. 
 I'll let you see yourself out. 
 Call me sometime. 
 She's amazing, Red. 
 You know that feeling when you meet someone  and it's like you've known them forever? 
 God, she's funny  and she's so... beautiful,  and--and I just feel amazing. 
 I feel like everything is working out. 
 I feel like I can do anything I want. 
 What's that? 
 What's what? 
 That pounding noise. 
 I can't hear anything. 
 I just remembered I--I left something in my room. 
 I'm gonna go and grab it, okay? 
 I'll be back in just a sec. 
 - Okay. 
 - Yeah. 
 I, um,  I burnt my hands, cooking. 
 I've got to keep them covered for a while  to allow them to heal. 
 Handsome. 
 He cooks. 
 Lucky me. 
 Well, I, --  I burnt my hands  cooking a pot of spaghetti,  but, I mean... 
 I like the way  that you're spinning it  much, much better. 
 What else should I know about you? 
 Well... 
 What are you smiling about? 
 This has been nice. 
 Meeting you. 
 Unexpected. 
 Right? 
 So far so good. 
 I want to kiss you,  but... 
 I think I might need permission. 
 Permission granted. 
 Not from you. 
 Good luck with that. 
 It's the last one today. 
 Really appreciate this, man. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Wow, this is, this is a nice home. 
 Thank you. 
 It's temporary, though. 
 Where's your tree? 
 We don't have one. 
 Maybe we'll skip it this year. 
 I thought I saw you at the Christmas lot  on Halpern. 
 No, not us. 
 Is this for me? 
 Nah, um, no. 
 This is... 
 This is for the gatekeeper. 
 Is that right? 
 Ty? 
 Come here for a sec. 
 Ty, this is Wilson. 
 Hello, sir. 
 Wow. 
 That's--that's good manners. 
 I don't mess around. 
 Hello Ty. 
 I have somethin' for you,  if you want it. 
 Can I open it now, or? 
 Yeah. 
 It says it,  it wants to be opened now. 
 I think you're right, it does. 
 Just this one. 
 Holy crap, Mom, it's a Pooka! 
 Holy crap, Mom,  it's a Pooka! 
 Watch your mouth, both of you. 
 What do you say? 
 Thank you, sir! 
 Wilson. 
 Call me Wilson. 
 Call me Wilson. 
 Yeah, they,  they can be a little unpredictable. 
 What? 
 You're kind, Wilson. 
 Something his dad never would have thought of. 
 No? 
 Not that kind of dad. 
 What kind of dad was he? 
 Not the kind I want to talk about. 
 I don't want to talk about him. 
 I... don't want him  to spoil my life anymore. 
 Wait here. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'm not goin' anywhere. 
 Hey! 
 Good job today. 
 You too. 
 You want to get out of here,  get a drink? 
 You--you go ahead. 
 I'll--I'm just gonna  hang out here for a bit. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Take care. 
 Hey. 
 Thank you. 
 Not just for today,  or the gig, but... 
 for everything. 
 Of course. 
 Take care. 
 --what the--no, no! 
 No! 
 No! 
 No! 
 No! 
 Dearie me, what-- what's wrong with you? 
 --love, come in. 
 Come in. 
 I'll put the kettle on. 
 There's nothing in the world  that a good cuppa can't fix,  as my mum used to say. 
 Of course, that's a lie, though, isn't it? 
 Some lies help you get through things,  don't they? 
 Good, strong tea got her through the Blitz,  after all. 
 I think there's something wrong with me. 
 There's something wrong  with all of us, love. 
 No, Red, I'm... 
 I'm losing time, and... 
 I'm losing control. 
 Things are all right... 
 right? 
 I have this job,  and this girl, and... 
 and it feels... 
 really good. 
 But then, there's this-- this thing, this... 
 this other thing, this... 
 danger. 
 I feel like I remember why I moved here. 
 So I could get away. 
 Away... 
 from pain. 
 Away from causing pain. 
 Everyone has regrets, Wilson darling. 
 Life is hard. 
 We make mistakes. 
 Make good choices now. 
 That's all you have. 
 Come on! 
 Come on, come on! 
 Good, aw. 
 Come on, guys! 
 It's Pooka, come on! 
 Come on! 
 So did you have fun today? 
 I know what you're up to. 
 What am I up to? 
 Trying to get on my good side  so that my mom will like you more. 
 You don't have to buy me things  or get us a tree. 
 You just have to stick around and be nice. 
 I can do that. 
 You don't like Christmas? 
 Tricky time for us. 
 Maybe I can make Ty love Christmas again,  so I'm throwing him a little Christmas party  at the end of the week. 
 Get a lot of his friends together,  play some music, exchange gifts. 
 So your mom, she told me  about your Christmas party next week. 
 Are you, excited? 
 Yeah. 
 It's gonna be a Pooka thing. 
 How cool is that? 
 Well, tell me this, now... 
 would you like to meet Pooka for real? 
 - -Hell yes! 
 - I heard that! 
 This is it. 
 That's it. 
 Yeah, this is the one. 
 Hey, Ty! 
 Come and have a look at this one. 
 Excuse me, pal. 
 Do you mind taking our picture? 
 Yeah, of course, man. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Look, Ty. 
 Look at all the pretty lights... 
 Are you going to hurt my mom? 
 
 
 
 Are you going  to hurt me? 
 Melanie? 
 You know,  you didn't have to promise that. 
 He's been telling all his friends all morning  that that thing is coming to his party. 
 I know you meant well, but... 
 he's going to be really embarrassed  when it doesn't happen. 
 Why wouldn't it happen? 
 - -Come on. 
 - No, I told you. 
 I have connections. 
 I told you, why--  why wouldn't you trust me? 
 I trust you, it's just... 
 are you sure? 
 You don't have to overpromise  to impress me. 
 No, I know! 
 I'm not trying to put things in his head. 
 Okay? 
 It's going to happen. 
 Okay. 
 - -Pooka! 
 Mom, Pooka's here! 
 Can you believe he's here at my house? 
 Pretty awesome. 
 Right? 
 Yeah, it's okay, I guess. 
 Have you--have you gotten to talk to him? 
 He's for little kids, what's the big deal? 
 Your dad isn't here. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Just--everybody knows about your dad. 
 Help... 
 Yeah, I don't know. 
 I really don't understand what happened. 
 No. 
 He's not saying much either. 
 You okay, buddy? 
 I'm sorry I wasn't able to make it today. 
 It's okay. 
 I'm used to it. 
 Can you tell me what happened? 
 Wilson. 
 I saw what he did. 
 I'm pretty sure I know who he is. 
 I was really scared. 
 They're livid. 
 I should have been there. 
 I wish you had been. 
 -I'm sorry... 
 that it went so wrong. 
 We both wanted the party to be special  -for Ty. 
 -Who was that guy? 
 What? 
 -That guy in the costume? 
 I just don't understand how someone like that  -could be around kids. 
 -Are you blaming me? 
 No, I just don't understand what happened. 
 That's all. 
 Wilson, you just seem kind of passive,  and it was really awful,  and I just don't understand, all right? 
 The kids love that toy. 
 I just thought that having the character there  interacting with them, that it would be special. 
 - I get that. 
 - I just wanted to do  something nice for Ty. 
 How was I supposed to know  something like that would happen? 
 -That's not what I meant. 
 -I just wanted to do  something nice for you and Ty! 
 That's all I want. 
 Where is it? 
 Where is what? 
 The tree. 
 -What tree? 
 -Christ, Melanie! 
 If you didn't like the goddamned tree,  you could have just told me. 
 Don't talk to me like that! 
 -What has gotten into you? 
 -I feel like... 
 like it's about trust, I feel like  you don't trust me. 
 You don't tell me the truth. 
 What don't I tell you the truth about? 
 Everything! 
 About the tree, Ty's dad... 
 What does he have to do with any of this? 
 Is he still in the picture? 
 Well, he's Ty's dad, he's not in the picture  but he's in the picture. 
 That's the way it works, it's not that simple. 
 Right, everybody knows about Ty's dad. 
 Everybody knows about him but me! 
 You need to leave now. 
 I'm... 
 -I'm-- -Don't touch me. 
 Leave. 
 Now. 
 The hottest toy of the season  has turned into its biggest disappointment. 
 Countless malfunctioning Pookas  have been returned throughout Los Angeles,  with parents complaining that the popular. 
 "Naughty or Nice" toys are suddenly broken,  all of them saying nothing but  one bizarre prerecorded phrase. 
 Look at all the pretty lights,  Look at all the pretty lights. 
 Sir, how do you feel about Pooka? 
 It was a total rip-off. 
 All day, all night,  it just kept saying the same thing  over and over. 
 Yeah, I-- I got my money back,  but where's my time? 
 This is bullshit! 
 - Yeah! 
 - This is bullshit! 
 Where is my time? 
 We want our money back! 
 Hey, man! 
 Thanks for bringing this by, appreciate it. 
 You don't look so good, man, what's going on? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Listen, I think corporate has got it wrong  and we just need to keep going. 
 What are you talking about, man? 
 There's been a recall, the PR's terrible. 
 There's no coming back from that. 
 You can't just let a few f*cking incidents  ruin everything! 
 It's more than a few incidents, Wilson. 
 The toys are busted. 
 Nobody wants to buy them anymore. 
 In fact, I'm glad you brought this,  'cause I gotta take it back. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 What's going on, man? 
 Hey! 
 This doesn't belong to you. 
 It's done! 
 Hey, man. 
 Take some time for yourself. 
 Get out of town or something. 
 Go live life. 
 Go have some beers with your bros. 
 I need to be inside it. 
 You gotta get a grip. 
 It's okay for this to be over, man! 
 - MELANIE Wilson! 
 Leave me alone, just go away! 
 Mel, please, I need to explain! 
 Mel? 
 Mel? 
 Mel? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Hello, love. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Red. 
 I'm sorry, love. 
 You're too late. 
 It's time for you to go. 
 Hi, it's Melanie, leave a message. 
 Hi, Melanie, it's me, Wilson. 
 Please listen to this. 
 I miss you, and... 
 and I understand, um,  I owe you an apology. 
 A real one, and, um... 
 I understand why you pushed me away  and why you were scared. 
 But I want you to know that things  are gonna be different now. 
 I was confused. 
 But I want to start over. 
 And I want us to be a family. 
 I'm worried about you, and, um... 
 I am ready to be a better man. 
 Hi. 
 Melanie, it's me, Wilson. 
 Please listen to this. 
 I miss you and... 
 and I understand, um, I owe you an apology. 
 Dude, watch where you're going, buddy. 
 And I want you to know that things  are gonna be different now. 
 What is your problem, man? 
 What's your problem, man? 
 I was confused. 
 I wanna start over. 
 I want us to be... a family. 
 I'm worried about you and, um,  I am ready to be a better man. 
 You need help, man. 
 Hey--hey, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 - Let's go. 
 - No, what are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 No, that's me! 
 That's me! 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Wilson. 
 What happened? 
 What did you do? 
 They took it, man. 
 They took it! 
 They took what? 
 My head! 
 Jesus Christ, do something. 
 I can't feel Pooka. 
 Wilson? 
 Buddy? 
 There is no Pooka. 
 It's an invention to sell toys. 
 It's you in a costume. 
 It's just you. 
 It's always been just you. 
 No! 
 No, no! 
 Stop! 
 No, no! 
 We see it a lot this time of year,  to be honest. 
 Was there a... 
 was there a struggle? 
 The only struggle was with the bottle  and five floors. 
 You need to find who did this to her. 
 Pretty sure I'm looking at that person  right now. 
 No, you're wrong. 
 I know exactly who you are! 
 No... 
 no, not them! 
 Not them! 
 f*ck! 
 Hello? 
 -Hello, Ty? 
 Ty, are you okay? 
 We're going to the tree lot. 
 We need to get a new tree. 
 Ty, Ty, listen to me. 
 Something is coming for you, okay? 
 You're in danger, all right? 
 - -Listen to me. 
 - -  Ty? 
 Melanie? 
 Ty? 
 You are not going to hurt anyone anymore! 
 You are not going to hurt  anyone anymore! 
 You are not going to hurt anyone  anymore. 
 Mel? 
 Mel, it's me, Wilson. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry for how I acted before,  but it's all gonna be different now,  everything's gonna be okay now,  everything's changed. 
 I've changed. 
 Mel? 
 We're sorry, you have reached a number  that has been disconnected  or is no longer in service. 
 If you feel you have reached this recording in error,  please check the number  and try your call again. 
 Melanie? 
 Ty? 
 Melanie? 
 Ty! 
 Go to your room. 
 I don't want to do this. 
 Melanie, I just want to discuss--. 
 You don't want to discuss it. 
 You want to convince me that you're not a liar. 
 So before I lose my sh1t,  get out of my house. 
 It's my house too! 
 Yell as much as you want. 
 But you blaming me is bullshit. 
 Do you know what it's like  to constantly be called a liar? 
 Do you know how that feels? 
 Do you know what it's like? 
 Do you know how stupid that makes me feel? 
 Do you even f*cking care? 
 f*ck! 
 Don't--  don't f*cking turn your back on me! 
 Dammit! 
 Ty. 
 I'm--I'm sorry. 
 Buddy, this... 
 this was an accident. 
 Okay? 
 But don't worry, we're gonna get a new one. 
 All right? 
 I'm... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 We'll get a new one right away, okay? 
 It'll be the best one ever, I promise. 
 The lot will still be open. 
 You know, we can just head down and get--  and get a new one  together, okay? 
 No. 
 Don't listen to him. 
 It's not okay. 
 He's lying. 
 He just wants to make himself feel better. 
 It'll be special. 
 Sweetie, go get your jacket. 
 This is the last time, Wilson. 
 It's over. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 -Hello? 
 Hello, Ty? 
 Ty, are you okay? 
 We're going to the tree lot. 
 We need to get a new tree. 
 Ty, Ty, listen to me. 
 Something is coming for you, okay? 
 You're in danger, all right? 
 -Listen to me. 
 -Come on. 
 Stay with me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry! 
 Slow down, Wilson. 
 Gotta get there on time.

 Want to get the best tree they have.

 All right, we got you, we got you.

 Stay with me. 
 Just relax. 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Look at all the pretty lights.
