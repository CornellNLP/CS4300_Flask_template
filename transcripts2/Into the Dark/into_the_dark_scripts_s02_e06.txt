 Hey, guys. 
 So I know my channel's been off the radar for a while, and no, I wasn't abducted by lizard people or sent to that top secret CIA prison island, which by the way totally exists. 
 I've just had to lay low for a while 
 'cause, well, I think the feds are watching me. 
 And like, I mean, yeah, of course they're watching everybody, but I'm talking like special ops task force kind of watching. 
 And normally, I'd just lay low till the heat's off, but... well, sometimes, the truth is more important than safety. 
 So here goes. 
 ♪♪ Okay. 
 It all happened a year ago. 
 St. Patrick's Day, actually. 
 Coincidentally, the same day that a meteor crashed into our town back in the '70s. 
 It was supposed to just be a night of college kids getting drunk, but a lot of people died, like, a lot of people.

 So, as you can probably guess, Misty unfollowed Chloe and hasn't looked back. 
 And as hard as it is to believe, her and I have actually gotten kinda close. 
 I mean, she's still a princess, but... she's actually kinda cool. 
 And Aaron? 
 Well, he's still a doofus, but we've been kind of hanging out a lot lately, and... I don't know. 
 Definitely not putting labels on it or anything. 
 So, anyways, that is the story of how me and my friends managed to stop an alien invasion. 
 Wild, right? 
 I mean, me, friends. 
 Of course, the feds showed up after with, like, tons of questions and not so subtly implied that this was all highly top secret, and "snitches get stitches" and all that, but... well, f*ck it. 
 There might be more nests out there, and it's not like those G-men did much to stop the last one. 
 Alan Moore once said that, "The truth of the world is that it's chaotic. 
 The truth is not some finely tuned conspiracy theory. 
 The truth is something far more frightening. 
 Nobody is in control. 
 The world is rudderless". 
 Well, bitches, these broadcasts are your instructions. 
 Seek and destroy. 
 Consider me your rudder.
