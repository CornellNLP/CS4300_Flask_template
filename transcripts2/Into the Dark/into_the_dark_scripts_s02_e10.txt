 This is not a test. 
 Access A28R. 
 Verified. Begin. 
 This program is to be viewed only in the event of the violent overthrow of the President of the United States. 
 In such an event, the following files are to be assigned Omega 6 classification. 
 This information must not be released to the public under any circumstances. 
 There is no contingency plan. 
 Ask not what your country can do for you... 
 The only thing we have to fear is fear itself... 
 Our long national nightmare... 
 I am the President of the United States! 
 Paddles. 
 Clear! 
 Again. 
 Clear! 
 Again! 
 Clear. 
 Every night, the dream comes. 
 And then it's gone. 
 Monday, quarter to seven. 
 Lights on. 
 My life has become a series of endless routines. 
 Five, four, three, two... 
 Top o' the morning, chief. 
 Rise and shine. 
 It's a good day to get better. 
 Mornin'. 
 I see they upped your calorie count, so something's working. 
 Yeah, it almost feels healed. 
 What'd I tell you? Progress. 
 You gotta drink more water for me, though, okay? Yeah, I know; you're right. 
 I don't have much of an appetite. 
 Well, let's get moving. 
 No, no; I'm gonna try it on my own today. 
 You think you're ready? 
 If I don't get outta here soon, I'm gonna lose my mind. 
 Well, we wouldn't want that, would we? 
 All right. 
 Easy does it. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 It's okay, it's okay. Goddammit! 
 You'll do better tomorrow. I thought I could do it. 
 Paging Dr. Burroughs. 
 Paging Dr. Burroughs. 
 My routine never changes. 
 Only the faces are different. 
 Hold on. 
 This isn't procedure. 
 And he isn't part of the routine. 
 Have I seen you before? 
 Let's start. 
 You said I'd recover my memory by the time I could walk. 
 I took my first steps this morning, still nothing. 
 That's wonderful. Congratulations. 
 Now, Dr. Larson, I can't... 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 You're lucky to be alive, Henry. 
 The blood loss from the second bullet deprived your brain of oxygen for ten minutes. 
 Technically, you died twice: once in the shooting, once on the operating table. 
 I've never known a patient survive that kind of trauma. 
 An outcome of retrograde amnesia, while unfortunate, is still a miracle. 
 If my body can heal, why can't my mind? 
 Perhaps it's protecting you. 
 Or maybe it doesn't want to face what happened. 
 Then tell me who I am and let me decide for myself. 
 In good time. 
 But for now, why don't you tell me how it felt to take your first step? You're not hearing me! 
 I'm ready for something else. 
 I am running a new study. 
 It's highly experimental. 
 But clinical trials offered hope. 
 Hope sounds good. 
 These treatments represent a breakthrough in neurotechnology. 
 But this regimen contains risks. 
 What kind of risks? 
 I can't share that information until you complete the trial. 
 Once started, participants must complete the study. 
 So even if you experience adverse effects, we require to continue. 
 Do you understand? 
 I want my life back. 
 What's that sound? 
 It's calibrating. 
 Welcome, Henry. 
 He'll get you situated. 
 Watch your knee. 
 How does this work? 
 Just look into the viewfinder and follow her instructions, okay? 
 Okay. You'll be fine. 
 This session establishes an emotional baseline. 
 Are you ready? 
 Yes. 
 Initiating phase one. 
 I've seen one of these before. 
 I tell you what I think it looks like. 
 Only speak in response to questions. 
 What is your name? 
 Henry. 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence incorporating the questions. 
 My name is Henry. 
 Can you identify the man in the photograph? 
 It's... it's me. 
 When was this taken? 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence incorporating the question. 
 I don't understand. 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence. 
 I-I get it. 
 Yes, I can identify myself. 
 That's Henry Cameron. 
 Why have you been taking these? 
 Please refrain from speaking until I ask you a question. 
 Do you want to get better? 
 I absolutely want to get better. 
 That's why I signed up for your trial. 
 Please refrain from speaking until the sequence is complete. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Hi. 
 You're up. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Better, I... I'm better. 
 Are you new? 
 Graveyard shift. 
 Only come out at night. 
 Your temperature's good. 
 Do I know you? 
 No. 
 Gotta go finish my rounds. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Can't you just... stay for a minute? 
 I don't get a lot of chances to just talk to people. 
 I'm in one of the trials. 
 I know, I, um... I peeked at your file. 
 So you know who I am? 
 I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. 
 No, no, no, say more, whatever... whatever you know would help. 
 Not now, Henry. 
 Goodbye. 
 You got it. 
 Atta boy, chief. 
 You got it! 
 Okay. Now we're training. 
 Come on! 
 You're almost there, come on! 
 Hey! 
 Atta boy, chief. 
 Beat your best time by 12 seconds. 
 I couldn't do it alone. 
 Alone? 
 You'll never be alone, Henry. 
 Don't you ever forget that. 
 I'll always be with you. 
 Until I get out of the hospital. 
 Right. Until then. 
 Now let's get you back to your room. 
 Okay. Do you recall any details about the night you were shot? 
 I don't remember anything about the night I was shot. 
 Tuesday. 
 Rise and shine. 
 Do you know why you were at the event where you were shot? 
 I don't remember being shot, so no. 
 Let's go. Wednesday. 
 Do you recall any contemporary world events? 
 It's a good day to get better. 
 Thursday. 
 I have no knowledge of any current events. 
 Come on! 
 Do you know the name of the President of the United States? 
 Rise and shine. 
 Friday. 
 I do not know the name of the President of the United States. 
 Dr. Burkhoff, please report to Psychiatric Intake. 
 It's you! 
 It's you. 
 It's you! It's you! 
 It's you! It's you! It's you! 
 Hey, hey, hey, take it easy! 
 Keep your distance, it's not your concern. 
 She'll be fine. 
 I saw you on my TV. 
 I saw you on my TV! 
 Sir, I found him! 
 He's here! I found him! 
 Don't let them take your brain! 
 Don't let them destroy you! 
 Help! 
 Saw me on her TV? 
 We get 'em all the time. 
 Come on, we're late. 
 What emotion does the following image provoke? 
 Do I know these people? 
 What emotion does the following image provoke? 
 Do I know these people? 
 You do not know these people. 
 What emotions does the image provoke? 
 Loneliness. 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence. 
 The image makes me feel lonely. 
 Do you mind if we stop for the day? 
 What do you think when you see this image? 
 Can you hear me, Dr. Larson? 
 Describe your feelings surrounding these images. 
 Not until you give me some answers. 
 Am I married? 
 Or do I... do I have a family? 
 You are required to continue the program if you want to get better. It's your turn to answer some goddamned questions. 
 I deserve that after sitting through this sh1t! 
 Please refrain from using negative language. 
 It undermines the efficaciousness of the protocol. 
 Screw you. 
 You are required to continue. 
 Screw you. 
 Shh! Where have you been? 
 They were getting suspicious, so I stayed away. 
 Who? Is this about my file? Listen, listen to me. 
 The study. 
 Your doctor. 
 Even... even your orderly, they... they're not what you think. 
 Everyone is pretending. 
 Why would they put on something this elaborate? 
 I can't say anything else, I'm sorry. 
 You have to, please. I'm sorry, I can't. 
 You're the only person I trust. 
 Rise and shine, chief, it's a good day... 
 Up early, Mr. Cameron. 
 Dr. Larson, dial extension 06, Dr. Larson, extension 06. 
 _ 
 What the f*ck? 
 _ 
 _ 
 No. 
 Omega 6? 
 Is it true? 
 Is what true? 
 Henry? 
 Henry! 
 Henry. 
 Get back here! 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 I wanna talk to someone in charge. 
 That is a confidential medical record. 
 Please... What the hell is this? 
 Henry. 
 You're clearly upset. 
 And you obviously misinterpreted something. 
 Am I the... 
 Are you the... what? 
 Am I the President of the United States? 
 Who told you that? 
 Tell me the truth, or I wanna be let out of here. 
 So it's true. 
 It is... 
 I'm the President of the United States. 
 Jesus. 
 It's best if you go back to your room. 
 Step aside. 
 I'm in charge and I'm leaving. 
 Hey, hey! Come on, Henry. 
 Hey! Be calm. 
 Don't f*cking touch me! All right, that's enough. 
 You're perfectly free to leave. 
 You always have been. 
 Take him to out-processing. 
 This way, Mr. President. 
 Thank you. 
 Can't say it was a pleasure. 
 Is this the way out? 
 It's right up here. 
 Is this a joke? 
 We're gonna make this nice and easy, Henry. 
 Please remove your clothing. 
 Why? 
 Psychiatric ward regulations require all patients be de-loused. 
 Please take off your clothes. Wait, psychiatric ward? 
 No, no, no, no, no, you're supposed to release me! 
 Please remove your clothing. 
 No, absolutely not. If you don't take off your clothes, then we're gonna have to do it for you. 
 You touch me and you go to prison. 
 Look, Henry. 
 We can either continue on being friends, which is how I like to see us, or we can become something different, it's entirely up to you. 
 I, for one, like being friends. 
 So, please... remove your clothing, Mr. President. 
 So out of all the people, I was picked, I was chosen. 
 Henry. 
 Welcome. 
 Please take a seat. 
 You said I was being released. 
 Please. 
 No, I'm not playing along. 
 Have a seat, friend. 
 Sit down. 
 Everyone say hello to Henry. 
 Hi, Henry. Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Hi! 
 Please, continue. 
 I'm gonna save all of you! 
 You and you and you and even you. 
 But we gotta get ready for the big trip first. 
 Hm. How do we do that? 
 It's not like I can call them on the phone or anything. 
 They speak to me when they want to. 
 In my head. 
 Listen. 
 What was that? 
 Sure, I'll tell her. 
 They say we need more electricity in the lights. 
 We need more. 
 We need more. 
 I understand. 
 Henry. 
 Please tell us a little about yourself. 
 You mean... who I am? 
 That's always a good place to start. 
 Fine. 
 My name is Henry Cameron, and I'm the President of the United States. 
 I'm being detained here in violation of pretty much every federal law on the books. 
 Isn't that right... Doctor? 
 Do any of you actually understand what I'm saying? 
 I'm the President of the United States! 
 Mm-hm. 
 I believe you, brother. 
 In fact, I think I even voted for you. 
 Thank you. 
 I appreciate that. 
 Leadership is lonely. 
 And then the bastards wanna take you down. 
 Exactly. 
 You know, nobody believed me when I became the Emperor. 
 The what? 
 Emperor. 
 Orion quadrant? 
 Andromeda nebula? 
 Four-hundredth in my line? 
 Don't listen to them. 
 They're the crazy ones. 
 Believe in yourself, that's what I always say. 
 It's not your turn, Garrett. 
 Don't call me that! 
 Don't ever call me that! 
 Please continue. 
 Henry? 
 Henry. 
 I'm, uh... 
 I'm good. 
 Helen. 
 How are you? 
 Honestly, I'm the best I've ever been. 
 Every day gets better and better. 
 I, um, I appreciate everything that you and the staff did to support my journey, from the bottom of my heart. 
 Thank you for teaching me how to live again. 
 Well said. 
 What a wonderful insight. 
 We're gonna have a nice night tonight. 
 Everyone needs their rest. 
 Lights out. 
 You again. 
 What the hell do you want from me? 
 I didn't mean what I said yesterday, I was confused. 
 Can we please go back to the way things were? 
 We're required to continue. 
 What if I say no? 
 It's for your own good, buddy. 
 You just have to trust the process, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Yes. 
 Do you ever feel confused about what is real and what is imaginary? 
 What kind of question is that? 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence incorporating the question. 
 I do not feel confused about what is reality. 
 Do you believe the man in the photograph has reason to be angry with you? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence incorporating the question. 
 The man in the photograph has no reason to be angry with me. 
 Do you believe the man in the photograph would be pleased with your progress? 
 What? 
 Response time is a factor. 
 What do you wanna hear? 
 The protocols are about what you want to hear. 
 A dream... 
 I don't know what I want to hear. 
 Do you believe it more likely that the President of the United States would wake up as a patient in a psychiatric hospital, or a patient in the psychiatric hospital would wake up as the President of the United States? 
 Please answer the question. 
 In a rational world, neither scenario is likely to occur. 
 Hey! 
 Is it true? 
 I told you not to say anything. 
 Am I really the president? You saw your file? 
 I don't know what that means. 
 'Cause they don't want you to know who you really are. 
 Henry? 
 Buddy? 
 What the hell is going on? 
 You were committed under a national security order. 
 It's called the Omega 6 directive. 
 The world thinks you're in a vegetative state. 
 So no one knows I'm here? 
 You're not alone, Henry. 
 You have allies. 
 People who will help you, if you let them. 
 Hi, um... 
 We-we met before, remember? 
 You saw me on TV? 
 Be careful what you say. 
 They can read your lips. 
 They're watching us now? 
 Oh, really? 
 Shut up! 
 Or we'll never get out of here. 
 I'm your secretary of state, sir. 
 Did someone try to kill me? 
 Yes, Mr. President. 
 But that was only the beginning. 
 Why? 
 Who's behind it? 
 It's a conspiracy, sir. 
 They're all out to get you. 
 Helen? 
 It's time. 
 I'm ready for our session, Dr. Larson. 
 I have some new insights for you. 
 I'm looking forward to it. 
 Do these animals have any reason to feel guilt? 
 What are you trying to get at? 
 I need a valid response. 
 Yes, these animals have reason to feel guilt. 
 Why would these animals feel guilt? 
 Because all sentient beings feel guilt. 
 Is it a logical response for sentient beings to feel guilt? 
 No. 
 Logic isn't the governing principle for most living creatures. 
 What is the governing principle of life? 
 I'll never die. 
 Please respond. 
 What is the governing principle of life? 
 It's love. 
 The biofeedback monitor indicates deception. 
 Tell the truth, Henry. 
 It's love, it has to be. 
 What is the governing principle for life? 
 Survival. 
 Say ahh. Ahh. 
 The man who shot you? 
 He's a fanatic, almost got lucky. 
 Secret Service killed him on the spot. 
 So why did I wind up here? 
 Opportunity. 
 Power. 
 The Oval Office has that effect. 
 The vice president was sworn in, but he knew it was only temporary. 
 So when you started to recover, he locked you in here. 
 And no one tried to stop him? 
 I tried, sir. 
 That's why I'm in here. 
 All right, that's it, come on. 
 Get off of me! 
 What are you doing? Come on. 
 Wouldn't killing me be a lot easier? 
 You're more valuable to him alive. 
 During the campaign, he's gonna parade you around for sympathy votes. 
 Be propaganda. 
 Yeah, but he'd need me incapacitated. 
 Yeah, a shell of your former self. 
 That's the real reason you're in here. 
 Nice and easy... 
 That's a good girl. 
 Come on, forget about it. 
 Who are these people? 
 They're wards of the state. 
 Subjects in classified programs even we didn't know about. 
 It's ironic, huh? 
 You two, move along, come on. 
 Mm. 
 What can I say? 
 People are paranoid of bugs. 
 No one wants an infestation around here. 
 You know, between you and me, not everyone around here has your best interest in mind. 
 Like who? 
 I don't know. 
 But what I do know is... you can always count on me. 
 Always and forever. 
 I think you're gonna get better, I really do. 
 Smart choices is all. 
 Is love rooted in biology or metaphysics? 
 I don't understand. 
 Do you believe that love is driven by the evolutionary mandate to procreate? 
 The concept of love must go beyond that. 
 Why must love extend beyond the realm of evolutionary design? 
 Because it has to. 
 Please formulate your answer into a complete sentence that incorporates the question. 
 Love must be more. 
 Would you ever kill someone you loved? 
 The dream... will never die. 
 Roses are white, violence is blue. 
 My brain is on fire, how are you? 
 Mr. President? 
 You okay? 
 They're doing it to you too, aren't they? 
 This isn't about me, sir. 
 This isn't even about you, this is about the future of our nation. 
 We have to get to the vice president. 
 That's the key. 
 No, sir. 
 That'll never work. 
 He's too protected. 
 And when he's down here watching us... 
 Him? 
 He's pretending to be a hospital administrator. 
 And he's planning on escalating your treatment. 
 Then we need to get out of here. 
 There's not much time. 
 Don't you understand where we are, sir? 
 Psychiatric wing of a hospital. 
 No. 
 Haven't you noticed that we can't see outside? 
 The sunlight's not real. 
 Those windows are fake. 
 We're in a Cold War bunker five stories beneath the White House. 
 It was built in the 1960s to withstand nuclear armageddon. 
 There's no way out. 
 There's always a way out. 
 And we're gonna find it. 
 Are you with me? 
 I serve at the pleasure of the president. 
 I want you to share something that you've never told anyone before. 
 When I get out of here, I'm gonna adopt a kid. 
 I wish I could go back before I was sick and make things right with my dad. 
 They told me I need a new pair of sneakers or the comet won't pick me up. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Garrett! 
 That's not my name! 
 Garrett! 
 That's not my name! 
 Garrett, Garrett, Garrett! 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Remember what I said! 
 I'll kill you! 
 Argh! Get off of me! 
 I'll f*cking kill you! 
 Get him outta here, come on. 
 You remember what I f*ckin' said! 
 I'll kill you! 
 f*ck! 
 f*ck! 
 Not my f*ckin' name! 
 Five, four, three, two, ten seconds. Okay. 
 Hurry up. Okay, okay. 
 Five seconds! 
 Are you close? Almost there. 
 Come on. 
 Clear, clear. 
 Okay. 
 There. 
 I did it. 
 The lock's ready for tonight. 
 Your handprint gives us access to the main west wing elevator. 
 Once they see you're alive, we'll go on TV. 
 You'll be reinstated. 
 And the vice president? 
 I believe treason is still a capital offense. 
 Go, go! 
 When? Tonight, after lockdown. 
 We can't wait any longer. 
 I can try and warn you if something goes wrong. 
 Thank you. 
 What? 
 I just... had the strongest feeling I've been here before. 
 What aren't you telling me? 
 Be careful. 
 You're in for a trip. 
 Open up. 
 Sweet dreams. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Do you believe it more likely... 
 ... that the President of the United States would wake up as a patient in a psychiatric hospital... 
 It's time. 
 If... if we don't make it out of here... 
 We will. But if we don't? 
 There are things that they can do to people in here, things that are worse than death. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I don't want to live like that. 
 So promise me you won't let me. 
 We're gonna get outta here. 
 I promise you that. 
 Come on. 
 They're all in. 
 All clear on C block. 
 They know, Henry. Run. 
 They know. Come on! 
 There! That's the elevator. 
 It's scanning. 
 It's searching. 
 Hurry. Come on. 
 Hurry! 
 I'm still waiting. 
 Come on! 
 It's not working. 
 Try it again, try it again! 
 Come on, come on! 
 Hurry, hurry! 
 It's still not working! 
 You said it would work! 
 The vice president must've reprogrammed the failsafe. 
 Come on! 
 It's the same access as the nuclear command, I should've... 
 Henry! Help! 
 Henry! Henry! 
 Drop it! 
 Good night, sweetheart. 
 Hickory dickory dock. 
 The mouse ran up the clock. 
 The clock struck one and down he run. 
 Hickory dickory dock. 
 Tick tock, tick tock. 
 I know you. 
 Hickory dickory do you? 
 I know me. 
 And what do you know about you? 
 I know the dream will never die. 
 Henry? Yes? 
 Henry? Yes? 
 Henry? Henry? Yes? Yes? 
 Henry?! Henry?! Yes?! Yes?! 
 Get out of my seat. 
 Tick tock. Tick tock. Henry? 
 Tick tock. Henry? 
 Henry? 
 Henry? Henry? 
 Henry? 
 Jesus. 
 How much did you give him? 
 I increased his dosage. 
 Don't worry, I'm not second-guessing. 
 What a mess. 
 What do we do now? 
 Keep moving forward. 
 Address his specific delusional architecture head-on. 
 Complete all the protocols? 
 Very well, you have my blessing. 
 What about punishment for this stunt? 
 We need to keep him in line. 
 Don't worry. 
 He'll think of something appropriate. 
 See that he does. 
 Spotless, Henry. 
 Spotless. 
 Yeah. 
 Good enough? 
 It'll work. 
 But on the other hand... there's something else. 
 I haven't had a chance to get my shoe shined. 
 I want to see my face in it. 
 Hurry up, Henry, it's not gonna clean itself. 
 You gotta make it shine, buddy. 
 Really shine. 
 I know you can do better than that. 
 What... do you want? 
 I think you know what I want, Henry. 
 Does the power of a nation reside in its government? 
 
 
 
 No, the power of a nation resides in its people. 
 What if the people can't be trusted? 
 You have to trust the people. 
 Is there any commonality between the governing structures of societies? 
 The power is always concentrated in an individual. 
 Is it fundamentally a good thing to concentrate so much power in an individual? 
 That depends on the person. 
 Do you believe that you are such an individual? 
 I believe that I am. 
 Should an individual have the power to destroy the world? 
 No one should have the power to destroy the world. 
 Do you believe it more likely that, A, the President of the United States would wake up as a patient in a mental institution, or B, a patient in a mental institution would wake up as the President of the United States? 
 Ask not what your country can... 
 In a rational world, I believe... 
 The only thing we have to fear is... 
 I believe... 
 Our long national nightmare... 
 I believe... I am the President of the United States! 
 I believe neither scenario is likely to occur. 
 But in an irrational world, anything is possible. 
 I don't know if I can wake up. 
 It's like my mind is feeding on itself. 
 I don't think I can take it much longer. 
 You have to keep fighting. 
 Remember who you are. 
 What if I can't? 
 I believe in you, Henry. 
 Don't follow me out. 
 Guys, I don't want any trouble. 
 What did you do to the Secretary? 
 The what? 
 Helen, the Secretary of State. 
 My Secretary of State. 
 Don't patronize me. 
 Have you noticed anything about the patients here? 
 Any patterns? 
 The Savior of the World... the Emperor of the Galaxy... the President of the United States. 
 Come on. 
 People suffer in different ways. 
 I'm trying to help you. 
 By upping my dosage? 
 An enhanced regimen, yes. 
 Bottoms up. 
 And you said what? 
 "Bottoms up". 
 You're pretty funny, Mr. President. 
 And... you're good. 
 Really, really good. 
 What is it? 
 Just wait. 
 Modern-day electroconvulsive therapy bears little resemblance to its predecessor. 
 Like everything in medicine, it's about the dosage. 
 Too much electricity destroys the brain's synapses. 
 Low voltage, on the other hand, increases synaptic plasticity. 
 It rewires the brain. 
 Doesn't that sound nice? 
 We can remove this, yes? 
 Please, I'll comply, I'll do whatever you want. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, this isn't about your escape attempt, or about you attacking another patient. 
 This is about your cure. 
 The module in your right hand administers an electric shock to your opponent; the one in your left increases the voltage. 
 My opponent? 
 Who's my opponent? 
 Me. 
 I'm your opponent. 
 I have a similar setup in the next room. 
 You can shock me... and I can shock you. 
 I'm... I'm not gonna do this. 
 Conflict is nothing to fear, Henry. 
 On the contrary, conflict defines you. 
 Please. 
 Please. 
 Please! Good luck, chief. 
 No. No. No, no, no. 
 No, no, no. No. Please! 
 Please! Please, no! 
 Are you ready, Henry? 
 I will not hurt you. 
 Do you believe that your life is more valuable than anyone else's? 
 I will not hurt you. 
 Do you believe that your life is more valuable than anyone else's?

 A, one person that you love, or B, 1,001 innocent children. 
 I would eradicate one person I love rather than 1,001 innocent children. 
 I answered the f*cking question!

 I can't assess the value of a single human... 
 You must assess the value of a single human life. 
 All human lives are priceless. 
 Could you ever harm another human being? 
 No! I could never harm another human being. 
 You just said you would eradicate 
 1,001 innocent children. 
 That's not what I said. 
 That's not what I f*cking said! 
 How do you like it?

 Hi. 
 I appreciate all your hard work, and that of your staff, to help me get better. 
 And I do feel like I'm getting better. 
 That's wonderful. 
 Why don't you sit down? 
 What? 
 Why don't you sit down? 
 What? 
 Why don't you sit down? 
 But you're in my seat. 
 You might be right. 
 It's hard to say. 
 What do you think? 
 I think you should give it back to me. 
 My seat? 
 Yes. 
 Your seat. Yes. 
 You won't get away with this. 
 I'll expose you. 
 Do you know what your problem is? 
 No. What is my problem? 
 The clock. 
 Please formulate your answer in a complete sentence incorporating... 
 Your problem is the clock. 
 Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock! 
 It's all right. 
 I'm gonna get you outta here. 
 I promised. 
 Fight, fight, fight! 
 You know who I am! 
 You know who I am! 
 You know! You know! 
 You know who I am. 
 You know who I am. 
 I know me. 
 I know me! 
 I know me. I know me. 
 Henry. 
 You... Shh. 
 How are you here? 
 Because the dream will never die. 
 Dream... will never... die. 
 I know you. 
 Yes. 
 I've always known you. 
 I'm your wife. 
 The dream... will never die. 
 "As long as we believe in ourselves". 
 You whispered that to me. 
 The night we won the primary. 
 That was my campaign slogan. 
 I knew then that our lives were never gonna be the same. 
 That you were gonna win, and I was gonna be your First Lady. 
 I thought I lost you. 
 Never. Never. 
 No, no, no! 
 Believe, Henry, believe! 
 Where is she? 
 Who? 
 Eliza, the First Lady. 
 _ 
 What is this? 
 What you've always wanted: answers. 
 _ 
 Henry Cameron, aged 46. 
 Born in a blue-collar community in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. _ 
 UPenn, political science major. 
 Ran for city council at age 23. 
 Lost. 
 Ran again three years later and lost. 
 Married two years after that. _ 
 Things were going well for a period of time. 
 Steady paycheck, career in operations management. 
 But still, your dream wouldn't die. 
 Three runs for Congress, three losses. 
 But your wife stuck with you through all of it. 
 Credit card debt, mortgage default. 
 And then, the night of April 16th. 
 You brought your wife to a reelection rally for the President. 
 The actual President. 
 The shooter failed in his assassination attempt. 
 He didn't even get close. 
 But several people were injured in the crossfire, including you... 
 ... and your wife, Elizabeth. 
 This won't be easy to hear, _ but she died in your arms. 
 Guilt, Henry. 
 The guilt over her death. 
 That's the real reason you're here. 
 Your mind couldn't handle it. 
 That's why it created this fantasy to protect you. 
 It's all very convenient, isn't it? 
 I want you to really think about the question I'm going to ask you. 
 What's more likely? 
 That the President of the United States would be imprisoned in a mental institution as part of an elaborate conspiracy, or a patient in a psychiatric hospital who had suffered a horrific tragedy would convince himself that he had the power to change the world? 
 We've had this conversation before, you know. 
 At least you're original. 
 But anybody with the right resources could make up this sh1t. 
 Show him. 
 Show me. 
 How could they put on something this elaborate? 
 No, no, no, please, you have to. 
 You're the only person I trust. 
 I... 
 I must've been sleepwalking. 
 Dreaming or something. 
 Bottoms up. 
 And you're good. 
 Really, really good. 
 Who are you talking to, Henry? 
 Who's there? 
 You manipulated the footage. 
 Doctored it. 
 Tonight, after lockdown. 
 We can't wait any longer. 
 Thank you. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Tell us who you see. 
 I just got the strongest feeling... 
 You cut her out... somehow. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no! 
 There's no one there, Henry. 
 She... she's not... 
 She's... she's gone. 
 It's time for the final protocol. 
 It's time to get better. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Will I remember any of this? 
 You never do. 
 Only your hope remains. 
 We'll try to remove that this time. 
 Fifty ccs. 
 Anything more would be bad. 
 Ready. 
 Goodbye, Henry. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 Henry, okay. 
 Henry, I know you're upset. 
 The story about my wife was very convincing, but I know the truth. 
 Henry, please. 
 More than 50 ccs would be bad. 
 Think about what you're doing. 
 I already have. 
 Let's move. 
 Come on! 
 Get all personnel accounted for, now! 
 Easy, easy. 
 Tell him to get back! 
 Put that down! 
 Tell him to put that down. Listen to him. 
 Put it down! Let her go. 
 Stay back. You stay back! 
 Do as he says! 
 Tell him to hold back. Roger. 
 Henry, please. 
 Do it. 
 How much do you want, Doc? 
 10, 20, 30? 
 Do it! 
 You were so convinced of your reality, Henry, but what happens when those elevator doors open and it's just another floor of this hospital instead of the White House? 
 It will cause a permanent psychic rupture. 
 You will be trapped in your delusion forever! 
 Better than being trapped here. 
 Get him! 
 Henry, no! 
 Hold the door! 
 Wait! 
 And with that, I relinquish the power granted to me under the 25th Amendment. 
 She's all yours, Mr. President. 
 Welcome back, sir. 
 I'm sorry we had to put you through that, sir, but the treatment required full commitment. 
 I appreciate everything you and the staff did to support my journey. 
 Anything for our country. 
 How are you feeling now, sir? 
 Honestly, I'm the best I've ever been. 
 I'm ready to get back to work. 
 The country was lost without you. 
 And I was lost without my country. 
 We live in a world of utter chaos and madness, where the unthinkable happens on a regular basis. 
 Like so many of you, I have loved and I have lost. 
 The First Lady was everything to me. 
 I still have moments of crushing sorrow and overwhelming sadness. 
 But in those moments, I ask myself a simple question: 
 What would my wife say if she were still with us? 
 And I know she would... tell me what she always told me. 
 She would say... 
 ... that as long as we believe in ourselves, as long as we believe in our country... 
 ... the dream will never die. 
 Thank you. 
 God bless me. 
 God... 
 God bless the United States of America. 
 God bless America. 
 Hmm. 
 Let's get you back to your room. 
 And God Bless the United States of America.
