 No one would have believed in the first years of the 20th century that we were being watched by intelligences greater than man's, yet as mortal as his own  
 (LIGHTNING CRASHES) 
  that as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinised as narrowly as creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. 
  (LIGHTNING CRASHES) 
  Yet, across the gulf of space, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes. 
  And slowly and surely drew their plans against us. 
  (BOOM!)

  (GASPS) 
  I think I saw it. 
  - Oh, really? 
  - Really? 
  Yes, it There. 
  - Look. 
  - Do you mind if I ? 
  Please. 
  Good Lord. 
  So that's Mars. 
  Yes, but did you see a pillar of smoke, - like a reddish flash around the edge? 
  - BOTH: Yes. 
  May I? 
  If one of you kind people could, uh I hope I can catch a piece of this in time. 
  Now, if you would please hold very still. 
  (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
  (BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY) 
  Gosh, look at that. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  What do you think it is? 
  A volcanic eruption, perhaps, along the lines of Krakatoa, only bigger. 
  People saw something similar last time Mars was this close to Earth, during the oppositions of '94 and '98. 
  Keep it. 
  It's a present. 
  Welcome to the neighbourhood. 
  - Ooh. 
  We're pariahs, you know, George and I. 
  - Ooh, yes. 
  I'm afraid so. 
  Welcome to the neighbourhood. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (DOG BARKS) 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  Find your balance. 
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  - No. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  - Easier said than done, actually. 
  - Try sitting. 
  Sit. 
  - No, it's actually easier for me standing up. 
  No, but you wobble when you stand. 
  Yeah, but it's about trying to find your momentum, I think. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  - At least it's nice to have someone to talk to in Woking. 
  - Oh, is it really? 
  - No, that must be lovely for you. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  - Yeah, thanks very much! 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  Stop it, George. 
  Now, it's the corner that's a worry. 
  (DOG BARKS) 
  - Speed up. 
  - I'll race you. 
  Come on. 
  A race? 
  OK, good. 
  Some incentive. 
  - Just gliding past. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  (LAUGHS) 
  You're looking at me in a very meaningful way, George. 
  Well, you just make me feel very poetic, Amy. 
  Are you sure it's poetry you're thinking about? 
  - Poetry's pretty passionate, isn't it? 
  - Yes, but it's brief. 
  (SLOW, INTRIGUING MUSIC) 
  (LOW, UNSETTLING MUSIC BUILDS) 
  Look, you've got one from the Socialist Society for the Abolition of Capital. 
  They've tracked me down, have they? 
  - George. 
  - Yes? 
  - You forgot something. 
  - What? 
  Give me a kiss. 
  - We won't be stuck here forever. 
  I promise. 
  - Well, we might. 
  Bye.

  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  Gentlemen, good morning. 
  It seems like the fuse we've all been watching for the last year may have just been lit. 
  Six trawlers out of Hull, 50 miles offshore. 
  They were fired on and sunk. 
  12 dead. 
  - Family men. 
  - Fired on by whom? 
  Russian Navy's sailing south at the moment, en route to engage the Japs. 
  Working theory is they mistook them for Japanese torpedo boats. 
  What, a bunch of trawlers 5000 miles from Japan? 
  Either way, Arnold, Britain will be joining the show, so response from the Admiralty, please. 
  They're readying the troops. 
  The Minister for War is going to be making a statement. 
  Get me a decent quote. 
  You Russian Embassy. 
  Naval Situation. 
  - Sir. 
  - George general research. 
  Very good, sir, but would you mind awfully if I went to the Admiralty instead? 
  It's only I have a source there, you see, sir, who I would rather like to speak to. 
  Your brother? 
  All right. 
  - Column and a half by midday; you can be in the finals. 
  - Very good, sir. 
  Take Arnold with you, though. 
  Be rather glorious, don't you think a war? 
  Haven't had a proper one since, what, Napoleon? 
  - Tunics and cavalry - Listen, Arnold, why don't you go to the embassy instead? 
  I'm perfectly capable of taking care of this alone. 
  Yes, but he wanted me to cover the Admiralty, and you butted in. 
  - What have you, in any case? 
  - What? 
  Well, nothing, no. 
  I just have this contact I'd like to speak to. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yes, of course. 
  Yes. 
  Yes, you're not you're not conducting personal business on company time now, are you? 
  - What? 
  - (BELL DINGS) 
  And this is from the Empire range. 
  We have it in stock down in Weybridge. 
  Full of rather vivid colours. 
  Nursery colours, perhaps. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  You know, I grew up near the Charminar. 
  My father was part of the survey. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - How are you finding it in England? 
  - Oh, rainy. 
  - Oh. 
  - When I got off the boat at Dover, I thought England was the most grey and cold place I could ever imagine. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Well, there's something to be said for the rain. 
  I know I would find India rather too warm. 
  And what does the man of the house do? 
  - He's a journalist. 
  - Oh. 
  Oh. 
  That's you, is it? 
  Yes, that's us. 
  Six weeks at least. 
  Excellent. 
  And thank you very much. 
  You know, we are very much in love, sir. 
  I'm sure the time will fly by. 
  (LOW, EERIE MUSIC) 
  (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS) 
  MAN: In the light of this cowardly and unprecedented attack by Russia, it is worth recollecting that if you ask any man what nationality he would prefer to be, 99 out of 100 will tell you that they would prefer to be Englishmen. 
  Anglo-Saxon territory is for the Anglo-Saxon race. 
  The best, most human, most honourable race the world possesses. 
  And any challenge will be faced and defeated. 
  We are an empire on which the sun never sets. 
  - Thank you. 
  - (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) 
  My secretary will take your questions, gentlemen. 
  - What's your response likely to be, sir? 
  - There's nothing much to add to what the Minister said, so, well, but I shall do my best, if you need facts and figures. 
  - (MEN SHOUT) 
  - What are the losses to date, sir? 
  Good morning, sir. 
  Is this covered by the Lansdowne Treaty? 
  And if so, how will the pact stand if the Russians attack us? 
  Sir, in regards to the Lansdowne Agreement, we are committed to wade in against Russia after certain lines have been crossed. 
  And is this one of those lines, sir? 
  (MEN MURMUR) 
  Yes, well, we we don't like to comment if we are not in full possession of the facts. 
  However, in response to the atrocities in the North Sea, we are embarking troops. 
  Army and Navy leave is cancelled. 
  And that's all I can give you. 
  Thank you, gentlemen. 
  (MEN MURMUR) 
  - Fred - HUSHED: What is it? 
  How the hell did you get in here? 
  I had a press pass. 
  It's the only way I can think of to come and see you. 
  I thought I made myself perfectly clear - I don't want to be seen. 
  - I, uh - I need your help. 
  - With what? 
  Oh, no, no. 
  You're You're You're joking, George. 
  I just know that you've always been very close to Lucy. 
  Well, so have you. 
  She's your wife. 
  Look, just just come over to the house. 
  Come and see us. 
  Come and meet Amy again. 
  Spend some time with her. 
  - We're, um, in Woking, near Horsell Common. 
  - I know where you live. 
  Don't you have a deadline or whatever they call it? 
  (UNSETTLING MUSIC) 
  (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
  (CROW CAWS) 
  Well, there's a women's college on Bedford Square. 
  You could do a Masters of Natural Sciences, apply in September. 
  - And how would a woman go about that? 
  - Well, a woman would get some letters of recommendation, speak to some of the old ladies. 
  - (DOG BARKS, DUCKS QUACK) 
  - Benny! 
  Hey! 
  - (DOG BARKS) 
  - Stop it! 
  - Benny! 
  - (DOG BARKS, DUCKS QUACK) 
  Leave her alone! 
  Stop! 
  Now, you were just saying you wanted to do something with your degree. 
  It would be a shame to waste it. 
  It's what you're good at. 
  Darling, that's very kind, but there's a rather important piece of the puzzle that needs to fall into place before anyone would give me letters of recommendation. 
  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  What? 
  - George. 
  - (DOOR OPENS) 
  What is it? 
  There's an egg there, Mary. 
  - From the duck? 
  - Uh, no, I think it's from the dog! 
  Mary ignore him. 
  I can do that. 
  - Thank you. 
  - What is that? 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  It's a present. 
  It's a - clock that makes tea by distillation. 
  George. 
  - Yes. 
  I went to see my brother today. 
  What did he say? 
  Nothing good. 
  What sort of business has a clock got making tea. 
  Please tell me. 
  What are they gonna do have a have a lavatory that makes bacon and eggs? 
  George. 
  (SOFT MUSIC) 
  (KNOCK AT DOOR) 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Good evening. 
  Fred. 
  This is my This is my brother Frederick. 
  - Thank you so much for coming. 
  - So pleased to meet you. 
  This is, uh This is my This is Amy. 
  Uh, can I? 
  Mary? 
  - Can I get you? 
  - Um, I'm not I'm not gonna dignify you or this person by spending any more time here than I must. 
  But you asked for my help this morning, so I'm gonna give it to you. 
  I've gone out to this venture. 
  - Fred. 
  - Go back to Lucy. 
  She'll forgive you. 
  I will forgive you, and then perhaps life can continue. 
  If you do not, if you persist in your folly, then I guarantee you that you will be ruined. 
  I guarantee you'll have no life to speak of. 
  It's a selfish, cruel pursuit, and it cannot help but bring forth the most unpleasant consequences. 
  Unless you do as I suggest, then this is the last you'll ever see of me. 
  - - Fred. 
  I'm the only brother you'll ever have. 
  (INHALES SHAKILY) 
  And there's the tragedy of it, George. 
  Good evening.

  (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
  (SQUELCHING) 
  So Greaves asks me for a column and a half, and I give him the article, and he puts it in the paper, but he puts it in under Arnold Henderson's name. 
  Why don't you just leave if they won't print your stuff? 
  Amy, but if I'm just gonna leave, then what are we gonna live on? 
  - I have the legacy from my father. 
  - But that's not very progressive, though, is it? 
  It's perfectly progressive. 
  I don't need to be kept. 
  I should never have put you in this situation. 
  You didn't put me anywhere. 
  This was my choice too. 
  We'll make it work. 
  Do you think so? 
  I wouldn't be here if I didn't. 
  Nuts to them, George.

  (LOUD RUMBLING)

  GEORGE: Well, so you think it's come from space, like Halley's Comet or something? 
  Well, they have elliptical orbits decaying. 
  It might take thousands of years, perhaps even go clean out of our sun system, and then suddenly one day, they're back, and bang. 
  Yeah, but I thought those things burnt up in the sky. 
  At thousands of miles an hour, perhaps even thousands of degrees of heat. 
  It's through here. 
  What could this be? 
  - (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
  - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
  Well, somebody's got some clearing up to do. 
  So, if it was if it was, um, thousands of degrees, yes, why why would it not have burned all of this down? 
  I think it got so hot it just flashed out for a second, scorched everything, and then burnt out. 
  So, is it a shooting star? 
  That's right, Mr Thing. 
  Shooting star. 
  (WONDROUS MUSIC) 
  (EXHALES) 
  Imagine what would've happened if this had hit London. 
  - (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
  - Another couple of seconds, it probably would. 
  - (EXHALES HEAVILY) 
  - Careful, Amy. 
  (LOUD RUMBLING) 
  You said it sounded like a bomb. 
  Do you think it could be a bomb? 
  How big would the gun have been? 
  - Mr Thing, who would've fired this? 
  - The Russians, perhaps. 
  - George, how big would the gun have been? 
  - All right. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (LOUD RUMBLING) 
  Don't you think we should inform the Army? 
  Why? 
  Just seems that in situations such as this that you inform the Army. 
  No, I telephoned to the Astronomer Royal. 
  This is common land. 
  We're perfectly entitled to be here. 
  The last thing we need is a lot of rough men in tunics clogging the place up. 
  - George, you should wire your paper. 
  - Yes, I think I probably should. 
  The telegraphs are out. 
  What, all of them? 
  Went down when I called. 
  Right. 
  Well, then, you've got to go in. 
  There's no way they won't print this. 
  Just show them the photographs. 
  I think you have a rather high opinion of my employers. 
  And we'll be all right here, won't we? 
  - Keep it warm till you get back. 
  - All right, just don't I mean it - don't touch that until someone - (CHUCKLES) 
  - George, I promise I'm not going to touch anything. 
  - All right. 
  - OK. 
  Well, be safe. 
  - Hurry back. 
  Hang on. 
  Turn around. 
  Let's get a quick One, two - (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
  - three. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Well shall we? 
  If we don't break out this story, sir, - then another paper will. 
  - George, we clearly have bigger fish to fry at the moment. 
  Wait for a local to file it on the agency. 
  - I'm local, and I'm filing, sir. 
  - Your news - there's hardly anything on these photographs. 
  - With all due respect, Mr Greaves, you haven't put anything of mine in now for six weeks, so Well, go and talk to your brother again. 
  - We need more on the Russian mystery. 
  - What, so you can promise me a byline, - and then give it to Arnold? 
  - It's not me. 
  It's His Lordship. 
  I'm sorry. 
  - His Lordship has views. 
  - No, I'm sorry, sir. 
  Are we pretending His Lordship is perfect now? 
  George, you cannot expect to do what you've done and have no consequences. 
  You're very lucky to have retained - any sort of job at all. 
  - Oh, sod that. 
  Really sod that. 
  George. 
  And sod His Lordship. 
  (SOLEMN MUSIC) 
  Get back to work. 
  Oh, it's a gossipy place, Woking. 
  I wouldn't worry. 
  Should hear what they say about me. 
  Why? 
  What do they say? 
  Well, gentleman bachelor of advancing years, likes to keep himself nicely turned out. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Well, um, George was married to his cousin. 
  They were somewhat manoeuvred towards each other by his family well, his brother. 
  They were betrothed when they were 15. 
  Ended up despising each other; no one was happy. 
  Then you appeared. 
  We met at a society for free thinkers. 
  Well, - I'm sure it was worth the joining fee. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  So, what do you think? 
  Do you think it could be from Mars? 
  What, the eruptions, you mean? 
  Wouldn't think so. 
  I mean, something can't erupt from Mars and end up in Surrey. 
  Well, at least it's a million to one against. 
  How long have you been married? 
  Um (CHUCKLES) 
  So that's the other funny thing. 
  Um Rather afraid we're not. 
  Oh. 
  (LOUD RUMBLING) 
  (EXHALES) 
  (LOW, MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) 
  MAN: All right. 
  Stand back there. 
  Hello. 
  I hope no one's been munting about with this. 
  - Stent. 
  Astronomer Royal. 
  - Ah. 
  - Ogilvy. 
  - Yes, sir. 
  Thought you were a chemist, not an astronomer. 
  Jack of all trades. 
  Put a tablecloth on it, Cyril, - and the other stuff, and a pot of tea, please. 
  - Right away, sir. 
  Good Lord. 
  Bigger than the Cape York one. 
  This might be the biggest meteorite every found. 
  Come in. 
  Let's have a snap. 
  Come on, chaps. 
  Are you going? 
  Harold, on my right. 
  The rest of you, try not to get in the way. 
  This is going to make some fellow very well known indeed. 
  (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS) 
  (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) 
  GEORGE: Good afternoon, Lucy. 
  - Good afternoon. 
  - I trust that you're well. 
  What do you think? 
  Why are you here? 
  Have you come back? 
  Sorry. 
  Then why in hell are you here? 
  I'm here to ask you if you will sign the papers. 
  Are you not ashamed? 
  - I'm very sorry. 
  - WHISPERS: Of course you're not sorry. 
  I am. 
  Of course I am extremely regretful for any pain that I may have caused you. 
  But what was I to do? 
  I agonised over the decision, and I had no other choice. 
  She's selfish, mark my words, that girl with the red hair. 
  That girl will do whatever it takes to make sure she gets on. 
  It's nothing to do with getting on. 
  Lucy. 
  Amy and I are in love. 
  We fell in love. 
  Just as I hope that you one day will fall in love. 
  I didn't intend for this to happen. 
  But can you really say that you were happy, Lucy? 
  WHISPERS: You're a coward. 
  That's your character. 
  Your brother says the same thing. 
  You're too afraid to face up to your responsibilities. 
  I'm sorry, Lucy, but I think this is about the only brave thing - that I've ever done. 
  - I couldn't give you children, so you left for someone younger and prettier. 
  My father had the measure of you all along. 
  I left because we made each other miserable, because we had no conversations often for weeks, because we shared no interests or views or friends. 
  Even if there was the remotest chance of having children, then I wouldn't want them to be born into such an unhappy situation. 
  Lucy, please. 
  Please will you sign the papers? 
  And sacrifice myself for the altar of your sickness? 
  No, George. 
  I will be the spectre at your feast. 
  You deserve every bit of pain that is coming to you. 
  And mark my words, pain will come. 
  VOICE BREAKS: If you want to marry again, you may do so when I'm dead. 
  That's my last word.

  - Sounded like clockwork. 
  - You'd need a devil of a big key. 
  - (LOUD RUMBLING, PEOPLE EXCLAIM) 
  - It's expanding. 
  George needs to see this. 
  Madam, who are you? 
  - Is this a place for a lady? 
  - She's my assistant. 
  (BREATHES HEAVILY) 
  Ah, Mary. 
  - Is the mistress at home? 
  - Been out all day, sir. 
  - (DOG BARKS) 
  - On the Common? 
  What about this bomb, then? 
  Well, it's not a bomb. 
  Is it? 
  May I go up? 
  My sister's there,  
  - and I should like to before it's  
  - Mary, would you mind waiting in the house. 
  In case the mistress returns. 
  Thank you.

  - What on Earth's happening? 
  - We don't know. 
  - Did you find your sister? 
  - She didn't come back. 
  - Well, let's find her, then we'll look for Ogilvy.

  - Jane! 
  - Jane! 
  - There she is. 
  - Oh! 
  Jane! 
  I can't think what caused a reaction like that. 
  Maybe there was some kind of chemical in there, like a phosphine, maybe something that combusts with the air. 
  - Well, do you think perhaps it's burnt itself out by now?

  - You two. 
  Him. 
  - Yes, sir. 
  The second one landed in the lake at Byfleet. 
  After we clean up this mess, we'll join you there. 
  - Yes, sir. 
  - King's Royal Artillery, move on! 
  Are you West Surrey? 
  West Surrey Artillery, that's right. 
  What, is there no one here from London? 
  It was a forest fire, that's all.

  We're hearing a lot of very odd things about this story, sir. 
  Shooting star hits Horsell Common, crowd gathers, then some sort of explosion. 
  No one seems to know anything for sure. 
  Well, there was a forest fire. 
  The West Surrey went in. 
  They haven't asked for enforcements, so whatever it is, it's in hand. 
  There. 
  That's where George said it landed. 
  That's where the fire was. 
  And that's his house.

  You? 
  No. 
  So, the other one's come down in the woods near Byfleet. 
  - What? 
  - Yes. 
  That's so close to the first. 
  - That can't be a coincidence. 
  - No. 
  I need to tell you something. 
  I, uh I went to see my wife yesterday to ask her to sign the divorce papers. 
  And? 
  Do you think we've been selfish?

  Something else is occurring to the south of London Hampton Court, Weybridge, near the site of the first impact. 
  I don't know what to make of the reports, but there are bodies floating down the river. 
  - We'd have them fetched up. 
  - Yes. 
  Commandeers and porters. 
  We're not having - corpses decorating the Thames. 
  - Mm-hm. 
  - Where's your brother now? 
  - Well, among this lot, I hope. 
  The refugees from the towns and villages around the event. 
  You trust what he said to his paper - about the shooting star. 
  - I don't know, Minister. 
  Makes as much sense as anything else we've been told. 
  - They're not printing anything about - Not until there's confirmation, sir. 
  - Where is the King? 
  - Sandringham, with the Prince and Princess of Wales. 
  There is nothing to suggest that it's not just an act of God. 
  Great piece of rock falls from space. 
  What are we hearing on the wires? 
  - Well, the local telegraphs stopped yesterday - Stopped? 
  and the Trans-Atlantic cables burnt out this morning, so we have no information. 
  What does that mean? 
  Does that mean it's happened somewhere else, not just here? 
  What the hell are we looking at? 
  There's no chance this is the Russians? 
  I honestly don't know, Minister. 
  The prime minister's in Scotland. 
  We're unable to contact him. 
  Until we know what this situation turns out to be, - I am taking charge. 
  - Yes, Minister. 
 
 
 
  (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
  Sir, one of the Surrey people wants to speak to you. 
  - Where? 
  Where? 
  Where is he? 
  - AMY: Have you seen my husband, George? 
  He's tall. 
  He might have a dog with him. 
  Have you see George? 
  Please tell me you've seen George. 
  I was supposed to meet him here. 
  I'm afraid I haven't. 
  When did you last see him? 
  (LOW, UNSETTLING MUSIC) 
  The horse I was on bolted. 
  It carried me off down Mayberry Hill towards Weybridge, and I lost George somewhere near the house. 
  He'd gone to rescue our dog. 
  He shouted at me to leave, and I I did try and get back to him, I did, but the fire was so intense. 
  - And that was the last that you saw of him? 
  - Yes. 
  Something, maybe the side of a house something fell down. 
  I just saw him swallowed by this smoke. 
  - And he shouted at you that you should go? 
  - Yes. 
  You did so? 
  - Yes! 
  - It was impossible for me to get back to him. 
  So, did your horse bolt or did you just ride it away? 
  It was impossible for me to get back to him. 
  Well (SIGHS) 
  maybe he managed to find a way out near Horsell common. 
  That's all you can say? 
  George has been my brother for 36 years. 
  When he was born, my mother allowed me to carry him in to meet our father. 
  And I looked after him on his first day of school. 
  He was scared, and he'd forgotten his pocket handkerchief, and I think he was crying for it, and I gave him mine and He was my baby brother. 
  My baby brother. 
  I was there. 
  Until you came along. 
  He still is your baby brother. 
  Or perhaps devoutly to be wished. 
  (SIGHS) 
  I'm going to have his child.

  It was hard. 
  A lot was lost. 
  Celebrate what we have. 
  Celebrate the miracle. 
  Yes, of course, but, uh the difficulty is if one knows in one's heart that God delivers miracles then one must also accept the thought of divine retribution. 
  To be frank, I find that very difficult to bear.

  That is not your concern. 
  Well, if anything has happened to George, - I rather think it is my concern.

  There was an eruption from Mars midnight every night for the last few days.

  Friday, and that's not to say it's the last explosion. 
  The belief is that he was kill at (STAMMERS) 
  at Horsell. 
  How far away is Mars? 
  Uh, oh, it's thousands of miles. 
  Hundreds of thousands. 
  It's about 35 million at the moment. 
  Then by that logic, dear lady, in 10 days, the thing must have travelled, what? 
  Hmm? 
  150,000 miles per hour. 
  Does that really sound likely? 
  Well, none of it sounds likely, does it? 
  Well And she saw what actually occurred at Horsell? 
  She was there with your brother? 
  Yes, the the thing came up into the air, apparently. 
  It didn't explode. 
  It didn't cause a forest fire. 
  (STAMMERS) 
  It sent out a pulse of some kind that burnt people to death. 
  Next day, something came out of the ground and burnt down all there was between Mayberry Hill and Weybridge. 
  - And what happened in Weybridge? 
  - Well, people were trying to escape. 
  They were trying to get on trains or get down the river, and then then this then this thing came up over the brow of the hill. 
  It seems to be some kind of some kind of creature. 
  Like a, um a machine. 
  It just let out this this this fire storm. 
  The regiments at Weybridge have 12-pounders old ones. 
  No shots fired, apparently. 
  The second one came down at Byfleet, and that's where most of these refugees are from from the impact. 
  We need to send in some of the London battery - some of the bigger guns. 
  - Isn't that responding unduly? 
  - I mean to say, we haven't - If it's an undue response to try and stop one of these things from getting here and slaughtering everyone in London, then, by all means, don't do it.

  He's dead, along with the rest of the company. 
  Whatever got us, sir, it's back there still. 
  I need to find my wife. 
  We were separated on Mayberry Hill, - and she was headed in this direction. 
  - We've got a 12-pounder coming up. 
  Orders are to go to the woods at Byfleet, where the second thing landed, bombard it before it opens. 
  - Can you handle a weapon? 
  - No. 
  Have you seen her? 
  She has red hair, and she's 25, and she was coming from Mayberry Hill. 
  - Mayberry Hill!

  We were wiped out. 
  We didn't get a shot off. 
  The only thing that came down Mayberry Hill was death. 
  She said that we should She said that we should meet in London, you see, so I'm asking for volunteers, sir.
