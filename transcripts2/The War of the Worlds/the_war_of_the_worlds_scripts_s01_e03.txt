 Did daddy fight? 
  No. 
  He was very brave. 
  - George! 
  - Amy, go! 
  And he shouted at you that you should go? 
  It was impossible for me to get back to him. 
  I need to find my wife! 
  - I thought I'd lost you. 
  - You'll never lose me ever. 
  Where's George? 
  People were in hiding. 
  They were isolated. 
  They were far away. 
  I was there. 
  I was there when they came out of their machines. 
  It's a sign of His Providence that the hallowed places are places where food may still be grown. 
  The church grounds are the only spaces where the cursed weed does not dare encroach. 
  It puts one in mind of the olive branch brought by the dove after the Great Flood. 
  And, like the Great Flood, we must put our faith in the Lord to overcome our adversity. 
  He gives us victory against our foes and brings us once again the miracle of new life. 
  I love you. 
  Love you, Amy. 
  How did it end for you? 
  I had to get out of Weybridge, so I jumped in the Thames. 
  They made the water boil. 
  There was a drain somewhere along the river so I crawled up there for days. 
  The smoke didn't reach me. 
  There was water there. 
  I had water there so that was something. 
  By the time I gathered enough strength to come to my senses, the victory was won. 
  How did it end for you? 
  I don't remember. 
  What time is it? 
  It's nine o'clock. 
  It It can't be. 
  Well, it's 9. 
  02am. 
  The day hasn't dawned. 
  It's the, er It's the smoke. 
  I I saw it rising up across London. 
  Are they shutting out the sun? 
  Is that the idea? 
  They going to smother the earth in it? 
  Maybe it's what the sky looks like on Mars. 
  I can't believe it just dropped. 
  What killed it? 
  I imagine it was hit, in the explosions. 
  We need food and water. 
  [HE SIGHS] 
  Here. 
  Eat some of these. 
  We need your strength. 
  A few days ago, me and, er, Mrs E, we drank some rather unpleasant-looking water, so I think that perhaps that's what's responsible. 
  - Well, that was a bit silly, wasn't it? 
  - Was a bit. 
  Is that what you do when I'm not here to take care of you? 
  Evidently. 
  There's a door unlocked down the hall. 
  Come on. 
  Let's see if we can find anything. 
  Rest. 
  Eat my sweeties. 
  Where is everyone? 
  This was supposed to be a refuge. 
  Maybe no-one ever made it here. 
  No, someone's been here. 
  Otherwise, there'd be food, supplies. 
  It's like they just vanished. 
  [HE SHAKES DOOR HANDLE] 
  One of these must be unlocked. 
  There must be a storeroom or something somewhere. 
  [LOUD BANG] 
  [LOUD BANG] 
  [LOUD BANG] 
  [LOUD BANG] 
  [LOUD BANG] 
  [BANGING GETS LOUDER] 
  [BANG] 
  [BANG] 
  Just a door banging. 
  It's just the wind. 
  [MYSTERIOUS WAILING] 
  All right. 
  You that way, I this. 
  [WIND RUSTLES IN DISTANCE] 
  [DOOR HANDLE RATTLES] 
  [LOUD RATTLING] 
  [LOUD BANGING] 
  [FLOORBOARDS CREAK] 
  [DOOR HANDLE RATTLES] 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [FLOORBOARDS CREAK] 
  [SHE SIGHS] 
  [SHE SCREAMS] 
  What? 
  What? 
  There are bodies scattered all over the roof. 
  There are your refugees. 
  God knows how they ended up there. 
  Some water. 
  That's enough for Mrs Elphinstone and George and the child. 
  I'm not sure the old lady should have any. 
  - What? 
  - She's dying. 
  I think she's got Typhoid. 
  We need to prioritise people who have a chance. 
  Don't tell George. 
  He'll only give her his. 
  There's nothing else here. 
  We can't stay. 
  [LOUD RATTLING] 
  Run! 
  Mrs E! 
  Come on! 
  Come on, wake up! 
  - She won't wake up! 
  - George, come on! 
  There isn't time! 
  Grab the girl! 
  Get under cover! 
  [LOUD BANGING] 
  [WHIRRING] 
  - [HEAVY BREATHING] 
  - Shh! 
  WHISPERS: It's seen her. 
  [CREATURE WAILS] 
  WHISPERS: That came from in here. 
  [FOOTSTEPS GET LOUDER] 
  Don't move. 
  [SHE BREATHES HOARSELY] 
  No. 
  Who Who is it? 
  Run. 
  Mrs E, come on! 
  [SHE GASPS] 
  Quick! 
  - Please! 
  - Shh! 
  Please! 
  - We have to help her. 
  - Quiet! 
  - Shhh. 
  - Oh, no! 
  [MRS E CRIES] 
  [CREATURE SNARLS] 
  [MRS E MOANS] 
  MRS E SHRIEKS, MOANS [MOANING CONTINUES] 
  [CREATURE SNARLS] 
  [MRS E MOANS] 
  [CREATURE WAILS] 
  [SHE MOANS] 
  [CREATURE SCREECHES] 
  What was that? 
  It must have come out of the machine. 
  We're going to have to shut ourselves in. 
  We need to fight. 
  [PEOPLE SHOUTING] 
  [GEORGE SHUDDERS] 
  George? 
  What is it? 
  Is he all right? 
  No, of course not. 
  He's starving and his sickness is getting worse. 
  We must think of something, Mrs Thing. 
  - [GEORGE GROANS] 
  - Shh! 
  I try to do this as often as I can. 
  Do you ever see anything? 
  No. 
  Nothing unusual. 
  Just the planet. 
  Although it appears closer tonight. 
  We must be approaching another opposition. 
  Look. 
  They're burning the bodies. 
  There's fever in the village. 
  I'll try and do a couple more hours before bedtime. 
  - Do you believe in God? 
  - [HE SCOFFS] 
  Assuredly not. 
  Then how do you explain the churchyards? 
  In what way? 
  The churchyards, the burial grounds, have been the only fertile places since the last few years. 
  So if you don't believe in God, miracles, Providence, how do you explain that? 
  You put your hope in this rubbish, Mrs Thing, we're in the Dark Ages. 
  We're already in the Dark Ages. 
  [WIND RUSTLES] 
  [WOOD RATTLES] 
  Now, I know things might look bleak, but let's keep our chins up. 
  It's not all doom and gloom. 
  And whatever that thing is out there, we outnumber it. 
  There's four of us against one creature. 
  And clearly, it doesn't yet know we are here. 
  Therefore, we have an advantage. 
  Let's not forget that chaps have been in situations like this before and they've come out smiling. 
  Just think of Baden-Powell at Mafeking. 
  The key thing is self-preservation and defence, so firebombs. 
  We can make them from lamp oil. 
  Come on. 
  - [HE CLAPS] 
  - Come on. 
  All hands to the pump. 
  That means you too, Georgie. 
  Can you fill these bottles? 
  And you, Amy, should help me tear these. 
  Baden-Powell at Mafeking. 
  What? 
  Don't you think that this could be our fault? 
  - Whose? 
  - Us. 
  Erm Englishmen. 
  Are you? 
  Are you quite serious? 
  Yes. 
  I mean, this is what WE do, isn't it? 
  We've been doing this to people for years, people that know no better. 
  - T-Take a rest, Georgie - No. 
  What if this is punishment? 
  It's not. 
  Life doesn't work like that. 
  Just think what it would have been like for a man in the jungle to see white people for the first time, to not have received friendship but death, to be cut down by bullets. 
  That is what we do. 
  We move across the earth and we take land and we build railways machines and smoke and metal all in our own image. 
  That is us. 
  We cut people down with bullets and fire when all they have is stones and spears. 
  That's just rubbish, George. 
  Why? 
  Because it's just complete rubbish. 
  Do you think that we bear some of the blame? 
  No, to be perfectly honest, I don't, no. 
  No. 
  Who do you think is punishing us? 
  God? 
  And do you think that's the same God that made us also made them? 
  You think that God created Heaven and Earth and Mars? 
  - Well, who else? 
  - [FRED LAUGHS] 
  God created Mars. 
  And all the little old ladies up on Mars, they they They put on their best hats and they go to church on a Sunday. 
  And they sing hymns. 
  And there's a little Martian Jesus, that all the Martian Romans nailed to a cross Don't laugh at me! 
  That is the problem with your lot! 
  You're always trying to see the other chap's side, which is fine when you're sitting in your drawing room in Weybridge drinking sherry, but it doesn't wash when you are fighting for your life! 
  Frederick! 
  He can't stay here. 
  None of us can. 
  We have to leave. 
  He's no better, Ogilvy. 
  If anything, he's worse. 
  What do you think they've got down in the village? 
  Well, they're weak from lack of food. 
  The water's bad. 
  Do you think it could be Typhoid fever? 
  Can you culture Typhoid? 
  Well, yes, I suppose. 
  You mean, make a serum? 
  Yes, but just culture it. 
  Why, yes, I could. 
  If I had access to someone who's sick. 
  Why? 
  [CREATURE WAILS] 
  Something's wrong with it. 
  Maybe it's injured? 
  Or it's sick? 
  Either way, this is our chance. 
  And then we make a run for it. 
  All of us. 
  There's a way around the edge of the machine. 
  - Come on. 
  - Where is she? 
  She She's just gone to get her Come on, darling. 
  Quick. 
  - Run! 
  Run! 
  - [SHE SCREAMS] 
  No! 
  There's another one! 
  Go! 
  - [HE SCREAMS] 
  - We can't get through! 
  Go! 
  Come on, then, you b*st*rd. 
  Fred! 
  FRED! 
  FRED! 
  FRED! 
  [CREATURE HISSES] 
  - [HE WHIMPERS] 
  - Shh! 
  Shh! 
  [HE SOBS] 
  I've never told anyone this before. 
  I've never told anyone how it, erm How it ended for me. 
  I thought you said you couldn't remember. 
  I didn't think I did. 
  I think I've just kept it locked away. 
  We've done all right, not remembering. 
  [COUGHING] 
  It was easier not to remember. 
  Wish we'd been married. 
  See, the thing is, Ogilvy there was a reason they came out of their machines. 
  To eat. 
  [CREATURE SNARLS] 
  [SNARLING CONTINUES] 
  [CREATURE WAILS] 
  They ate flesh. 
  They ate human flesh. 
  I think that's what killed them. 
  You want to experiment on these sick people to test some theory that it was our own infection, our own disease? 
  That's an emotive way of putting it. 
  Something here made them ill, just like it makes us ill. 
  That, combined with the fact that they've been eating the rotting flesh That is a rumour of the more lurid type. 
  I saw it! 
  People saw many things under great grief. 
  Half of them are fairy stories, fairy tales of people being eaten alive. 
  It won't hurt just to let us in and try. 
  No! 
  [THUNDERCLAP] 
 
 
 
  He'll be fine, I promise you. 
  We have to try. 
  I just need I need to finish this article. 
  I need to go in in the morning, cos I need to give Greaves a column and a half by But so then I'll hand Hand in my notice, but I just have to finish this. 
  I just have to finish this article first. 
  All right, George. 
  Just, er do it in the morning. 
  Yes? 
  Mm, mm. 
  [CREATURE SNARLS] 
  There must be something in the air. 
  Or maybe Maybe it's in the meat. 
  Something they don't like, something that weakens them. 
  It would be rather poetic, wouldn't it? 
  If they'd studied us, if they'd They'd worked out how they'd deal with us LUCY IN HEAD: You deserve every bit of pain that is coming to you FREDERICK IN HEAD: If you persist in these follies, then I guarantee you will have no life You have always been a coward You broke my heart Too afraid to face up to your responsibilities Selfish, cruel. 
  [VOICES IN HEAD OVERLAP, ECHO] 
  We should just call out to it. 
  - We should just - George! 
  I'll go and speak to it. 
  I'll go I'll go and reason with it. 
  It must be able to see reason. 
  Cos it's intelligent, isn't it? 
  It's intelligent. 
  And this can't be the first meeting between two advanced worlds. 
  I think it's just a ter- I think it's just a terrible misunderstanding. 
  George, stop! 
  - George, stop! 
  George! 
  - I'll just go and reason with it No, George, stop! 
  No, it's all right. 
  It's all right. 
  Don't worry. 
  Don't worry. 
  Don't worry. 
  It's all right. 
  [HE COUGHS, SHUDDERS] 
  We just need to wait here a while and it will die, like the other one did. 
  [SHE SOBS] 
  [SHE MOANS] 
  Come on! 
  Come on! 
  It was George Junior's! 
  It was his! 
  [THUNDERCLAP] 
  I used the blood I collected before we gave him the serum. 
  I cultivated Typhoid bacteria, salmonella typhi, combined it with fasciitis, rotting flesh. 
  It's dead. 
  You killed it! 
  Yeah. 
  [SHE LAUGHS] 
  It's a start. 
  It is. 
  It's perhaps not too late in the year to clear some land, plant some seeds. 
  If we can just make it through another year. 
  There's no guarantee the seeds will grow, but this is how we do it, not by praying, not by saluting the bloody Union Jack. 
  When he's better, Mrs Thing, I would like to take George for a swim in the sea, without it being clogged up with all that horrid stuff. 
  I should like a bacon sandwich! 
  - It's a start. 
  - It's a start. 
  It's proof of nothing. 
  It's hardly anything! 
  Take it or leave it, sir. 
  It's dying. 
  And the victory, the knowledge of victory, the knowledge that God and Great Britain repelled the creatures, you would take that away and have the men think instead that it was their own rot that was humanity's salvation? 
  I think it's more suggestive of a higher purpose, that the Martians were killed by the smallest creatures that God put on the planet, that we have learned to fight off, or live with, over millions of years, at the cost of millions of lives. 
  That's not Christianity, sir. 
  That's Darwinism. 
  All survival is built on sacrifice. 
  And that is a fact. 
  [SHE SIGHS] 
  Something has to happen soon. 
  George. 
  Something has to happen soon. 
  [SHE SIGHS] 
  [SHE GROANS] 
  George, I'm all right. 
  Please just lie down! 
  Amy. 
  What? 
  I don't think anything's going to happen soon. 
  I don't think it's going to go away. 
  Stands to reason, doesn't it? 
  There's two of us and there's one of it. 
  - It can't get us both - What? 
  I'm a nice fellow. 
  I'll just talk to it. 
  And I'll tell it that I have a wife and I have a child - I would very much like to spare. 
  - [AMY SOBS] 
  Please, George, don't! 
  Please! 
  I love you. 
  I love you, Amy. 
  George! 
  George! 
  Please come back! 
  George! 
  [CREATURE HISSES] 
  [CREATURE SNARLS] 
  [CREATURE SHRIEKS] 
  Run! 
  [CREATURE SNARLS] 
  [CREATURE HISSES] 
  [CREATURE HISSES] 
  George! 
  [SHE SOBS] 
  I let him go. 
  And I was able to get away. 
  I-I didn't see him die. 
  I just ran. 
  I suppose I've always hoped he lived. 
  Why have you carried this for so long? 
  How could I not? 
  Amy you had a child growing inside you one of the last children to be born here, perhaps even one of the last children ever to be born. 
  George was delirious. 
  Probably dying, in any case. 
  So how can you blame yourself? 
  You did this impossible thing in order that your child might be born and might live. 
  Well, what good has it done? 
  Look at him! 
  I haven't been any sort of mother Look at him. 
  He's on his own. 
  No. 
  Amy, he's alive and that's what counts. 
  Life is what counts. 
  [BIRDS CALL] 
  [SHE COUGHS] 
  [THUNDERCLAP] 
  Tell me about things. 
  Things? 
  In the world. 
  Things. 
  Well, move up, then. 
  Come here. 
  You know, George, there's There's lots of marvellous things. 
  Where I grew up, people didn't look like us. 
  They, er They had brown skin. 
  And often, they were very poor. 
  Didn't always have enough to eat. 
  You know what? 
  They were so cheerful and so happy. 
  They wore really bright colours. 
  [SHE CHUCKLES] 
  And the sun When the sun shone there, it was so warm so bright. 
  And the sky wasn't grey, pink. 
  It was blue. 
  Clear blue. 
  And there were lots of animals. 
  All sorts of birds, of different colours. 
  Tigers, mongooses, snakes. 
  And then there were the mountains. 
  The mountains were Well, they were bigger than you can even dream, George. 
  And they were, gosh, purple, black, grey. 
  Some of them were even white with snow. 
  Cold, white snow. 
  I used to go visit my father up there. 
  He'd be drawing maps. 
  And then one day, when I was a little bit older, I, er I got on a ship. 
  And I sailed across the oceans. 
  And I came I came here. 
  When I got off the ship, I thought [SHE SIGHS] 
  "It's a little bit rainy. 
  " But I thought it was pretty. 
  Its countryside and its cities. 
  People. 
  Millions of people. 
  And children. 
  Thousands of children. 
  Children everywhere, playing and laughing, singing and, er, eventually going to sleep. 
  One day, can we go there? 
  [THUNDERCLAP] 
  I will start packing our bags. 
  Night-night, Mummy. 
  I love you. 
  Go to sleep.
