 You buried a Catholic priest at a Jewish hospital?

 I minister to broken priests. 
 No last rites. 
 I'm a Jew. 
 A call from your office led to the body of a murdered priest.

 Ah! 
 What are you doing, huh? 
 Nothing, I was just thanking him for the party. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. 
 Go, go. 
 Ah!

 Mom was so f*cked up when she picked me up from school. 
 It was embarrassing. 
 Why are you being such a bitch? 
 She's trying her best. 
 f*ck you, Conor. 
 Everybody drives drunk. Who cares? 
 That's not true. 
 Everybody drives drunk, and everybody looks at p0rn, and everybody steals sh1t when people aren't looking. 
 Dad's a f*cking thug. 
 Daddy's not a thug. 
 I meant it in a cool way. 
 Jesus, Bridge, you're a f*cking mess. 
 [door opens] 
 Come on, dog. 
 Mom? 
 Shh, don't scare it. 
 Whose dog is that? 
 It's my dog. 
 This is my dog. 
 Come on, up, up. 
 Come on. 
 Where are we going? 
 I'm taking you home. 
 My father's gonna kill me. 
 When you talk to the police, what are you gonna say? 
 Um, that Nick's an addict. 
 He needed money, and so he got drug dealers to kidnap me. 
 Right? 
 Then what happened? 
 Nick changed his mind. 
 The dealers, they killed Nick. 
 I fought them off. 
 I stabbed one with my pen and shot him. 
 The other got away with the money. 
 Who am I? 
 Don't know. 
 Never seen you before in my life. 
 Good. 
 My father's gonna kill me. 
 Smell that? 
 Jasmine. 
 Mrs. Rosenblatt : Okay, Mr. Donovan. 
 I can see you mean well. 
 I will get the grill approved retroactively at the next meeting. 
 You're a doll. 
 [chuckles] 
 I've been around the block, Mickey, and I know you've been around that same block too. 
 I have a nice bottle of red. 
 Ooh. 
 Hey, are you gonna toss your dick into that old bag? 
 Watch your mouth. 
 [laughs] 
 I think the meat was funny, 'cause I'm starting to get... spinny. 
 Nothing wrong with the meat. 
 Maybe you drank too much. 
 Why do you have to be so tough on the ladies, Gary? 
 Huh? 
 Why do you have to treat them the way that you do? 
 The thing about girls, man, is, their job is swallowing cock. 
 Since they're just inherently lazy, someone has to be the guy to keep them... keep them motivated. 
 I see. 
 Is it true that thing's 50... 
 Whoa. 
 55... 
 That's a hell of a grill, man. 
 Gary? 
 Gary? 
 You fell asleep. 
 [Hail to the Chief  ringtone] 
 You got Mickey Donovan. 
 There's a doctor in the kitchen. 
 Get the... 
 Mr. Finney wants to speak with you. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You'll see, Raymond. 
 It's gonna be a great adventure. 
 flight attendant : At the gate in Los Angeles. 
 [sighs] 
 I hear it was quite a spectacle. 
 I apologize. 
 It was already a mess when I got there. 
 Casey's idiot friend Nick is dead. 
 Media's turning my son into some kind of action hero. 
 You even made one of them run away just in case I was the kind of man that would ask insurance to cover the $5 million that you just returned to me. 
 Are you? 
 My father was a criminal, Mr. Donovan. 
 He ensured that I didn't have to be. 
 And your father? 
 What did he do? 
 Nothing good. 
 So you had to be your own guide, find your own way. 
 You'll find that fair. 
 Kafka said, "In man's struggle against the world, bet on the world." 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Hmm, you agree? 
 No. 
 I'm with you. 
 People like us, you bet on the man. 
 You most definitely bet on the man. 
 Enjoy the view, Mr. Donovan.
