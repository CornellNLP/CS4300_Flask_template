 Previously on  Ray Donovan... 
 You need to stop seeing my wife. 
 That's up to her. 
 Where are the pictures? 
 Uh, right there, folder. 
 The other pictures. 
 Abby :  Don't you get it? 
 All I ever wanted was for you to look at me! 
 But you can't. You can't talk to me. 
 You can't share your pain with me. 
 Terry : You're the love of my life. 
 Come to Ireland and marry me. 
 Hey, Cookie... 
 (tires screech) 
 Ray :  You heard the shots, and then you saw Cookie walking away. 
 Marvin? 
 Ray :  Did he see you? 
 I don't know She should go to the police. 
 She should tell them what she saw. 
 You don't understand how dangerous this guy is. 
 He already killed one kid. 
 How do you know her life isn't already in danger?! 
 I'm about to become the number one law enforcement officer in the United States. 
 Hell, in the f*cking free world, Mick! 
 But you guys are gonna bring me down. 
 Let me get this straight. 
 You like watching Cochran  f*ck your wife? 
 But he's your boss. 
 How do you put up with that? 
 You know what, Tom? 
 We can fix this. Shorty : You see what I'm saying? We could knock this place off real easy. The FBI said that Mickey offered to get Sully out of the country as a part of their sting. Listen to me. You're being played by Mickey and the FBI. Yeah. You ruined my f*cking life, Ray. Okay. I really liked you. I trusted you. Ray. Steve : What's wrong, Ray? Come in. Tell me about your day. (laughs) Papaya? Swim? (groans) Every day, a man should tempt the ocean's yin and yang with his presence. Let the ocean decide his fate. (sighs) I got to go. Seems like you could use a day of quiet reflection, Ray. All that heavy sh1t going on at home. Your poor daughter's dead boyfriend. Your wife... f*cking another man. I drank too much. No, don't be like that. Don't go back inside your shell. It's good to talk to other men about your sh1t. It's good to open up. Hi, Ray. Bye. Look at that! That fucker is back, Ray! Look at that! sh1t. Oh, no, don't... (scoffs) m*therf*cker. You came back for a beating, didn't you? You little f*ck! No! No! (shouts) (laughs) Is this what you want? No! Hey! Come on, Ray! (laughs) Come on! (whirring) It's your turn! What are you f*cking doing?! I get it. Be merciful. Get out of here, Bob. He hits her! I've seen it! He hurts her! I had to protect her! Get the f*ck out of here now! Once, I was trapped at the base of a 12-foot storm wave. I didn't panic. I surrendered to the outcome. And the loving mother spit me back out. Showed me mercy. Just like you just did for that poor man. You hurt Ashley? That's a part of our sexual life. And it's none of his f*cking business. You lay a finger on her again, I'll f*cking kill you, you understand me? Come on, Ray. Let's go in the water. Let's let the waves wash everything away. Come on. I'm not f*cking swimming with you! Flight attendant :  Ladies and gentlemen,  please stow all of your belongings and turn off your port electronic devices. We will be landing in Los Angeles shortly. Ezra (over earphones) : We all were. Besides, Sean shot the girl with our gun. High on your drugs. Ray said you were in trouble anyway. You'd stolen a lot of money from Sully. Mickey : That's no reason to frame (sighs) (recorder clicks) You need to put that away, miss. Oh. I'm sorry. (gunshot) No! (panting) Bridget? Bridget?! Bridget? What is it? (panting) It's... (sighs) Wh-What are you doing? (panting) I'm sorry, honey. It's nothing. (line ringing) (phone vibrating) Kate? I'm sick of your lies. Where are you? Go f*ck yourself. (line ringing) Yeah. Avi, I need you to find out where Kate McPherson is. Boston? No, I think she's in L.A. Boss, I think you should forget about that woman. Just f*cking find her. Cochran :  Yes, sir. I understand. No, no, no. Thank you, Mr. President. Yes, sir. I will see you in Washington. All right. Was that...? Yeah. Oh. Did you get it? He said he thought the people would feel safer if the country's super cop was looking after our nation's security. (laughs): Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you. Washington, here we come. Mmm. Mmm. (chuckles) Oh, gosh. I have to lose weight. No, no. Yes. None of that. You're perfect. Mwah. Yes! Yeah! Oh, my... (gasps) (exhales) You know, the vetting process begins immediately, right? I know what we should do tonight. Celebrate with the Volchecks. Uh... let me think about that, okay, sweetie? Okay. (kisses) (chuckling) Mm-hmm. (chuckles) I want to put you all in, m*therf*cker. Not enough. Not enough chips. (groans) Uh... (sighs) Okay. Call. (chuckles) Full house. Four of a kind. (shouts) (beeping) (sighs) Lord today. (phone ringing) What? Are you with my father? No, man. That reporter's back. I need you with him all day today. You don't pay me enough. Get over there right now. I need more money. I can't spend all my time looking after that pain in my ass. You want more money? Do your f*cking job. Keep my father in check. Oh, sh1t. Mickey : All the wiring in that pot place is ancient, obsolete. What a f*cking break, huh? That lady reporter is here. What? (knocking) Kate : Mr. Donovan? It's Kate McPherson. I forgot to tell you. I gave her the envelope that you left. She came back after the division guys took you. I thought you were dead. Did I f*ck up? It's okay. No big deal. Hello, Mr. Donovan. What brings you back to town? You remember Mike Renzetti? Who? Come on in. Mike Renzetti. Walpole. Told me Sully hated you. You go talking to rapists in Walpole, you're gonna get wrong ideas. Told me you ratted out Sully's entire family. That he would never have trusted you to get him out of the country. You want a drink? Maybe a joint? What happened to you the night that you called me? Nothing. I showed up the next morning, your door was busted and you were gone. Hmm. (chuckles) Somebody scared you. Then you told me a pack of lies. Nobody scares me, Missy. Ray does. Me scared of Ray? It's the other way around. No, Ray isn't afraid of anyone. Oh, yeah? He's afraid of me. He paid Sully to... (chuckles softly) Paid Sully to do what? (exhales) Ask Ray. Now, get the f*ck out of here. Bridget : We could have taken the bus. You both got your phones? Why don't you loan me your gun? Don't be a smart-ass, Bridg. I'm not comfortable with this. It's gonna be okay, Mom. (sighs) Be careful. (phone vibrating) Yeah? Boss, you were right. She arrived in L.A. this morning and rented a car. Find her. Ezra : Can I offer you some water, some juice? Raymond. We've just signed over the rights to Marvin and Re-Kon's music. And Mr. Brown is our new client. Congratulations. This means I get access to him now, right? Lee : Of course. Give me a minute alone with my nigga. Hey, look, I hear somebody might be shopping a video of whoever killed 'Lil Homie. Who told you that? You know the streets, Don. I'll look into it. I'll pay whatever they want. I just want to see whoever hurt my boy get justice. You and me... we cool? Sure. Volcheck : To my mentor... and good friend. Here's... to many years... of service together. You can leave that with me. No, I'll give it to him in person. Travis : "Bathroom on the right"? Hysterical. Cochran : I knew another lead singer who thought that "Purple Haze" was "'Scuse me while I kiss this guy." Excuse me "while I  kiss  this guy"? Not "kiss the sky", "kiss this guy". (laughs): That is hysterical. I'm sorry to interrupt Hi, Tom. Travis was just leaving. Thank you, Travis. Sir, can I just say how proud I am of you. Tommy, what do you want? Well, I just... wanted to know if I was going to Washington with you. I don't think so, Tom, no. Well, then would you consider me as your replacement here? Wow. (chuckles) My replacement, huh? That's what all this has been about for you, huh? Just, uh, moving on up in your career? No, of course not, sir. It's just that you've been a mentor to me, and a guide, and I have the utmost respect for you. And I thought since there was a position opening up here now that maybe... You thought you'd just slide on in there, huh? Of-of course not... sir. It's just... we've all been so close... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you blackmailing me, Tom? No. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Not at all. No. Sir, I'm just... Congratulations. You deserve it. I'm looking over everything. Everybody's got their job. And timing is important, so you're important. I got this, Mick. I can blow that security guard in two minutes, or I can blow him in ten. Make it go as long as you can. Use your wiles. I won’t tickle his balls, then. No finger up the ass. Oh, thank you for that. Guys... I don't think you understand. I need two and a half hours just to crack the safe. You're gonna get your time. This is just to get us in there and hide. But we still need to go in through the roof. Really? Why? Because if we go through the door, there could be an alarm. No. They never put an alarm on the roof. (coughing) We should tunnel in through the f*cking floor. That'll only take us a year and a half. (coughing continues) Are you all right? I'm fine, Mick. Seriously, I'm fine. Keith : Donovan, get out here. Hey. I'll be right back. Glad you came. I got something I want to talk to you about. Step into my office. Let's say... one night in the very near future... I needed to turn this off. What would that be worth to you? A thousand bucks? Five thousand? You got five grand? Not on me now. I'm saying afterwards. You look the other way, I'll give you five thousand. I'm a parole officer, and you just offered me 5,000 imaginary dollars. I could violate your ass, and it won't be to some imaginary prison. But if I had real dollars, you'd go for it? Mm. Here's the deal. You don't leave here. You report to La Playa 5:00 a.m. sharp. With the hairnet. Back to business as usual. Where's that watch my son gave you? You pawn it? How come he can pay you off, I can’t? Think about it. The f*ck are you doing here? I need something. You really f*cked up my boyfriend. You broke his f*cking femur. He can't work out. He's gained like, 20 pounds; he looks like sh1t. Sits on his ass all day. And I can't even break up with him. Who's the new guy? f*ck you, Ray. Here's your shake, Marty. Thank you, Troy. You need me to stay. No. You heard anything about a video of the Re-Kon-Marvin Gaye murder? What if I have? I need it. Uh, that would be evidence in a criminal investigation, Ray. I'd have to turn that over to the police. Cut the crap. How much, Marty? Footage like that would be worth millions. Find it. And you have the money? I have a client who does. If I find it, I want a million dollars. Done. And a year's worth of exclusives on Tommy Wheeler. And I mean f*cking exclusives. All right. Troy! Show Ray out. Miss, you can't smoke here. Sorry. Were you looking for some eyeliner? Or blush? I don't know. Would you like a makeover? A what? A makeover. Sure. Sit down. Your skin's so light. You have cool blue undertones. If I use icy or jewel tones, it'll really bring out... Can you just not talk? I'm sorry. Can you just do the makeover and not talk? Of course. Jim (recorded) : You've reached Detective Jim Halloran. Leave a message, I'll get right back to you. I need to see you. (line ringing) Bob : Where the f*ck have you been? The story we put out is wrong. You got to get a retraction ready. I'm not printing a f*cking retraction. Just hear me out. I got something new. It's huge. I'm gonna bring down the president's appointee for the head of the FBI. And maybe even solve the Sean Walker murder. You sound like a crazy person, Katie. f*ck you, Bob. I got this thing figured out. You'll see. Do you mind? 
 
 Terrance! Terrance! What? Your brother's back on the cot, sleeping all goddamn day. Well, leave him alone. Let him sleep. Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Let's just go to Ireland now. I-I don't have the money. So? I saved about $40,000 for his college, and he doesn't need to use it all. I ain't taking your son's money, Frances. No, it's my money, Terry. I earned it. I'm not letting you take care of me. Because I'm a woman? No, because that's not the way things are done. We don't have to be citizens right away. We can get jobs. No, no. That's not who I am. I have to own something. I'm a business owner. I know you are, Terry. But we have to start somewhere. I'm not taking your money. (sighs) Well, that's f*cking ridiculous. Yeah? Well, I'm still not taking it. Jesus Christ. Why haven't you found her yet? I got Lena over at the marina in case she shows up. I don't know what else to do. You check every goddamn hotel in town. That's what you do. Why are you still worried about this woman? Mind your f*cking business, Avi. You are my f*cking business! You are letting everything fall apart over this woman! You let another man f*ck your wife, and you do nothing about...! sh1t! (panting) You don't f*cking get it, do you? We don't find her, it's over. She prints what she knows, we all go to prison. (phone vibrating) Yeah. Get in here. I know she's in town. I'll find her. I'm not talking on the phone about this. Upload this and send it to me. (panting) I don't understand why we need anybody else. We got a good thing with just... you, me and Cherry. A little backup wouldn't hurt. Okay, just one, then. Just one more guy. See? Hey, Terry. You ever meet my good friend Shorty? Nah. Okay. Well, now you have. You, uh, got 5,000 bucks you can spot me? No. All right. Don't worry about it. Daryll here? He's in the locker room. You have a very nice place here. Mickey speaks very highly of you. Shorty, this is my son, uh, Daryll. Daryll, meet my buddy Shorty. Hey. What do you want? Listen. I know that you always wanted that car. It was wrong for me to give that to Conor. You take it. You know, fix it up a little bit. All I need is, uh... you know, maybe 5,000 bucks. It's worth at least that. f*ck you, man. Hey, hey. Listen, listen, listen. Get off me. You don't want the car, I, uh... I'm doing a little deal. A little goodie. I'm gonna cut you in. You give me five grand, I swear... you'll get a hundred thou back inside a week. How you gonna do that? Well... planning a little job. A job? A robbery. I was gonna ask you to... to join up. I'm talking big money. You are so full of sh1t. I give you five grand, that's only thing I'll be missing. No way. Let's go. I got the money. What? I'll give you the money. But I'm in on the job. I don't know about this, Mick. This thing works, how much we talking about? Terry, you're not a criminal. You don't have the stomach for it. Lend me five, I'll give you back ten. f*ck you. I got nothing left. You want the money? You make me a partner. Congratulations. Big day for you. Yeah, it would be. If your f*cking girlfriend wasn't back. (sniffles) Kate (recorded) : I got something new. It's huge. I'm gonna bring down the president's appointee for the head of the FBI. And maybe even solve the Sean Walker murder. Uh, what are we gonna do about her? I'm gonna find her and set her straight. She has to go, Ray. I won't let you do that. Are you suicidal? Do I have to kill you, too? We're not killing anyone. I'm about to be vetted by the entire Senate Judiciary Committee, okay? And every f*cking journalist in the country over the next two weeks. Every rock will be turned over. Do you understand that? This woman is gonna f*ck everything up, Ray. No. This will f*ck everything up. (Megan moaning) You come after her or me, this goes viral. Ray. Ray. (door closes) Oh, f*ck, no. Oh, no. f*ck, no! Excuse me. Is Detective Jim Halloran here? Jim. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I-I really have to talk to you. Okay. Okay. Come on. I need you... I need you to do something for me. Anything. What? I need you to get rid of Cookie Brown. What do you mean? Arrest him or hurt him. Hurt him? I can't eat. I can't sleep. He-He's gonna kill my daughter. Abby... You plant something on him. Or you pull him over and shoot him. Shoot him? He's a f*cking criminal. I'm a cop. He's already killed two people. If you don't do something, he's gonna kill my f*cking daughter. If you want something done, you need to get your daughter to show up and tell the truth about what she saw. If you won't do this for me, I... I can't see you anymore. Jim. Be a man. Tommy. Oh, sir. I'm glad to see you. I-I want you to know that I was not trying to manipulate our private relationship for personal gain. You know all those times you thought Megan was doing Pilates and I had my 1:30 briefing? I was f*cking her. I'm... sorry to hear that, sir. (chuckles): Well... You're gonna be a lot sorrier when I stop f*cking her. Sir, I don't think I understand. I thought about what you asked me this morning, and you do deserve to be a director, so congratulations. I made some calls. You're going to Bismarck, North Dakota. Sir, please don't. I... Hey, you think Megan's gonna follow you there? Think she's gonna cheer you on while you're out investigating illegal elk hunting on the reservation? Why are you doing this to me? Why am I doing this to you? You-you called Donna and you told her that you wanted her. You invited us into your home. And you let that f*ck plant cameras and record our f*cking private time together? (sighs) Turn up your nose at f*cking my beautiful wife and you set me up?! You're f*cking finished. (door slams) Are you going to the funeral? There's gonna be so much coverage. Your picture's gonna be everywhere. I hope not. Why not? Listen, do you want to hang out this weekend? Hang out? If you need me to go to the funeral with you or anything. You know, for support. Support? You wouldn't even talk to me last week. You didn't even know my name. Conor :  Hey. What is it? I wanted to see you. Why? Everybody's so full of sh1t. They're never gonna catch who did it, are they? Conor... I was in the car. You saw it? You know who did it? Yeah. And Daddy made me lie to the police. They're never gonna arrest him. That's f*cked up. You're right, Con. It is f*cked up. Everything's f*cked up. I met Mom's boyfriend. What's he like? Do you still like M&M'S? Yeah. Come on. He's okay. What if he has a bunch of kids and we have to live with them I don't think he has any kids. Thanks. (beeping) Ray : Abby? Where are the kids? School. You look pretty, Abs. We got to go. What are you talking about? We need to leave town. We need to go back to Boston. Abby, we're not going back to Boston. You can't be sure he didn't see her, Ray. It's fine, sweetheart. Everything's gonna be... No, don't touch me. (sighs) You know I'd never let anything happen to you or the kids. (phone vibrating) Yeah? I know where she is. (sighs) Are you coming back, Daddy? Soon, sweetheart. You f*cking left again. That's it. I'm writing you up. Not so fast. What the f*ck is wrong with you? How many times I got to come looking for you? (sniffles) Half now, half later. Like I said, tomorrow or the next day, I tell you to turn me off, you turn me off. What do you got planned? You got your money. No questions. Look, all I'm saying is, what if I wanted more than $5,000? What would I have to do? Ooh. Okay. You gonna kill me, Ray? You need to let go of this. I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth. You lied about everything. I had to. Why? To keep you alive. Bullshit. You didn't want to go to f*cking prison. (sighs) You keep this up, you're gonna end up dead, Kate. So what? Journalists die all the time… occupational hazard. You want to tell me why you paid two million dollars to have Sully kill your father? You don't quit, do you? No. What'd you get for dinner? Burger. Want half? Yeah, sure. f*cking starving. Thanks. So, why do you hate your dad so much? What'd he do? He was supposed to take me to a baseball game. Never showed up. Come on, Ray. I'm serious. I know that Sean Walker killed that girl, and that you framed  him  for it. Why? All right, f*ck it. My father was Sean's dealer. Sean got high. Mickey let him play with his gun. f*cking idiot thought it was a toy, fired it, that was the end of Colleen. So, you blame Mickey for that? Yeah, I f*cking blame him. Everything he touches turns to sh1t. My mother's dying of cancer, my sister's using. Finally, she throws herself off a roof. Where the f*ck was he? Getting high. Screwing some whore in the projects. (sighs) I did some research. The day your father gets out of prison, the priest was shot. St. Josephine's Parish. (sighs) I know about your brother Brendan's settlement. $1.4 million. Oh, yeah? They target families like yours. The mother's sick, the father's absent. What about Terry? Did that priest abuse him, too? Leave Terry out of it. They don't stop at one kid. They move from one to the other. What about you, Ray? (gasps) (Kate moaning) (panting) (groans softly) (moaning) Did he get you, too? Shut up. Did he f*ck you up like he f*cked up your brother? (gasps) (groans) (shrieks) (both grunting) (crying) Ray! (grunting) (gasping) (coughing) (sighs) (crying) f*ck. (crying) (phone chimes) (phone chimes) I'll f*cking do it. (phone ringing) Hello? Terry : Frances? Are you okay? We're going to Ireland. What are you talking about? It's all gonna work out. I'm gonna get the money. How? Don't worry about it. You know I love you. Terry? (sighs) A good team trusts each other. That's all you have to know. If you got any questions, ask them. Terry. Terry. Ronald, this is my son Ter. Cherry : Hi. Mickey : He's, uh... he's gonna be our muscle. Muscle? He's shaking like a leaf. How's he gonna do anything? Well, you want to find out? Oh, you don't want f*cking none of this. Now, listen, if I say he's gonna be our muscle, he's gonna be our f*cking muscle. Who's this guy? He's my parole officer. Jesus, Mick, are you f*cking crazy? Now... we're just going over the plans. Close the door, Ter. Mickey : All right. Everybody look at each other. And Mr. Cochran has a band. Oh? Eddie and The Undercovers. That is such a clever name. Mr. Cochran? Call me Ed, please. What kind of music do you play? Classic rock. We do not go past 1979, mostly because music stopped being good after that. (laughter) Woman: I know! Didn't it? Yes, it did. And you, Mrs. Cochran, are you musical? Oh, I'm just a fan. But I really love to dance. Me, too. Ooh. (laughter) Well, you should come with us some time and watch him play. Tommy, what are you doing here? (people gasping) Tommy. Donna (crying) : Oh, my God. Please, no. No. (people screaming) Oh... (Abby and Jim moaning) Oh! Oh! (moaning loudly) Yes. Mmm. That's what I'm talking about! (laughs)
