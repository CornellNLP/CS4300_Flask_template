 Previously on Ray Donovan... 
 Hey, Frank. 
 (groans) 
 I'm about to become the number-one law enforcement officer in the United States. 
 Hell, in the f*cking free world, Mick! 
 But you Irish Spring, you Lucky Charms eating pieces of f*cking sh1t... you guys are gonna bring me down. 
 You got me wrong, pal. 
 I'd never give up my son. Go f*ck yourself. 
 Now give me something I can use against him. 
 There's rumor that he's f*cking someone's wife. 
 Who? 
 His ASAC, Volcheck. You're a cop. Well, you never know when you're gonna get in trouble. If you do, give me a call. Who the f*ck do you think you are? You let go of me! Call the police! Abby : I don't want to go home. Can we go to a hotel and have s*x? (wry laugh) What do you think? It's the deodorant I stole from your bathroom  the night you f*cked me. You like it? Cool. Why don't you go take it for a spin? He loves it. There's a... little Mexican joint around the corner... do you want to join us? Jesus, Marvin, what are you doing here? My dad will kill you. Marvin : I miss you, Bridg. Man : Found an ounce of marijuana in Bridget's backpack. I didn't do it. I don't have any pot. Leave me the f*ck alone! Ray : We killed a f*cking priest. Could get dug up any day now and she knows who put him there. She's not gonna say anything. She's got a f*cking family! (Woman breathing passionately) Mm. You all right, Tom? Oh... he fell asleep in the sauna. Poor baby. f*ck her harder, Eddie. (laughs) Come on. Hey, Mom. You know what tomorrow is? Tomorrow's Saturday, honey. You want to explain this? Marvin gave it to me. And you have no right going through my room. Oh, I have every right. Fine. Keep it. Why did he give this to you, Bridg? Why? Because he loves me. He loves you? (scoffs) How would you know? What does that mean? You're a victim. You don't think we hear you crying yourself to sleep every night? I never heard anything. You don't know what you're talking about. You're so f*cking full of sh1t. Hey. That's not how you talk to your mother. Of course, you don't want me to say anything... the only reason she's crying is because of you. Hey! Abby : She's seeing that boy again. His name is Marvin. Do you know about this? (sighs) Bridg, why didn't you say anything? You beat the sh1t out of him. You think she's gonna confide in you now? I didn't lay a finger on him. I'm seeing him again. And there's nothing you can do about it. Sweetheart, that boy has real problems. So what? I have real problems. What are you talking about? You're both going to therapy. You're probably gonna get a divorce. And we're moving to Trousdale? What's Trousdale again? You don't got to worry about all that stuff. Don't touch me. Calm down, Bridg. The cops planted pot on me. And you know it was really about you. What? Oh, yeah, you didn't tell her, did you? (sighs heavily) I'm going to the beach. With who? Not Marvin. That's all you care about. You're not going anywhere. Just let her go. Don't leave me here. Go get your stuff. (door opens, closes) She got arrested? She didn't get arrested. It was a mistake. I looked into it. You're a f*cking liar. It was about you, wasn't it? She wouldn't make that up. Calm down, Abby. You know, she's right. I am a victim. We're all your victims. You're not a f*cking victim. She's a teenage girl. She got upset. She doesn't mean it. All right? She does mean it. We are f*cked up, Ray. I had enough of this bullshit. So have I. (door opens, slams) ♪ That you're stealing my boy ♪ 
♪ But I'm a patient girl ♪ 
♪ You know I can wait ♪ 
♪ Till the end of time ♪ 
♪ If that's what it takes ♪ 
♪ To make you mine... ♪ (knocking on door) ♪ Stars above ♪ 
♪ Ooh, they tell me ♪ 
♪ That with you, boy... ♪ The heroin dealer moved to 203. I gotta put up a sign. Oh, wait, no, no, no. um... It's from Ray. Oh, you're the lezzy who works for my son. I been waiting for this. Got a whole celebration planned. Want to come in? No, thank you. There's only $300 in here. How am I supposed to live on $300 a week? Every two weeks. Oh, no, no. This can't be right. Call Ray. He gave that to me himself. I saved Ray's ass. Did you know that? Risked my life. Probably saved your ass, too. And who's gonna pay for my goddamned door frame? Hey, babe. Hi, Cherry. Hey, babe. Hi, Shorty. Haven't seen you in a while. Yeah, well, I don't get erections no more. Oh, that's too bad, Shorty. You hang in there. 150 bucks a week. What kind of stipend is that? You know what kind of car my son drives? Mercedes CLS. You can't do sh1t with that kind of money. That's exactly Ray's point. Bowel movements? Regular. Any new tremors? Here and there. It's the same as last time. And the medication's working? Like-Like I said, more or less. Great to see you, Mr. Donovan. Frances will finish up. I thought you quit. I am a nurse, Terry. This is my job. I'll find a new place to work. Don't. I want to tell you the truth about that night. No. I don't want to hear anything you have to say. You can't afford the house in Trousdale. I've looked at it from every possible angle. What are you talking about? I gave you the down payment. You gave me cash. Ezra pays me in cash. Terry Donovan's Fite Club makes a million dollars this month? I don't think so. I... I've been there. It ain't gonna happen. I can barely make that gym look like it covers the house in Calabasas, but a $5 million house in Trousdale? Forget it. Four point six. I told you to have Goldman/Drexter put you on the books 20 f*cking years ago. I'm on the books, they own me. Honey, you're not on the books because they don't want you on the books. Oh, fine, Ray. You're a free man in Paris. But you can't afford the house in Trousdale. So stay in Calabasas and leave me the f*ck alone. I want that house, Harriet. So start giving me checks with f*cking names on 'em! Hey, there. Hey. Lena, right? Yeah. You done? Yeah, I just finished my 60 laps. Nice. How much more you got? I'm finished. I was just gonna go in for a sauna. Want to join? Sure. You know, I have to be at work in an hour. Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was gonna try to make you late. (quiet laugh) Mm... I just have to run to the ladies' room. Mm... mm-mm... mm-mm. Okay? Yeah. I'll be right back. You don't go anywhere. All right? Okay. Give me a second. I'll be right back. Narrator : The cross stands on a mass grave... just one of thousands scattered all over Ireland. Such memorials bear stark testimony to one of the greatest tragedies in Irish history... the Potato Famine. (man singing on video) Isn't Ireland on an island? What's your point? I don't see why they couldn't have just gone fishing. (phone rings) Patty? Hey. Hey. Is this a... Is this a good time? Yeah, what's up? Well, I was just, um... seeing what you were doing for dinner tonight. I got no plans. I mean... nothing set in stone. (over phone): Great, well I was gonna roast a chicken, and, I don't know, I... I like chicken. Okay, great. (over phone): You know, I feel bad I didn't put the right stem on Cliff's bike. It's been killing me. (chuckles) So I-I could swing by the shop on the way over. Cliff's actually, uh, staying over at a friend's tonight. Oh. Okay. I could still fix it, though. Great. Do you mind? Oh, I-I've got a noon appointment. I got to get to the salon. I'll see you later. Bye. What the f*ck? Sorry. (sighs) Let me get this straight. You f*ck his wife. He f*cks your wife. It's a threesome. It's a foursome. And then when you're done, you order a pizza. Is that it? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm an FBI agent. You let me out of here... now. (wry laugh) Sit down, Tommy. You like watching Cochran f*ck your wife? I didn't think so. But he's your boss. And if you don't let him f*ck your wife, he sends you to some f*cking place like Des Moines, huh? That it? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, uh, I don't know... maybe you're actually enjoying this. You think I like f*cking Donna Cochran? I don't know. Jesus, it's like f*cking my mother. But what am I supposed to do? When he calls, we go. What choice do I have? How do you put up with that? He promoted me to ASAC. And now he owns you. You know what, Tom? We can fix this. We're good. He's gonna meet you at his place. Okay, so you and Cochran settled everything. So why are you doing this? Why? He's a killer. He slaughtered Tiny. Besides, I need insurance. I know, but... Look, Avi, if I tell you to wire a house, just wire the f*cking house, all right? Okay, boss. You're right. Okay. (phone ringing) Yeah. I need you to come to the Expo. Ashley... This isn't a joke, Ray. This is not for me... it's for a friend. He needs your help. He'll pay you whatever you want. (knocking on door) What is it, Pie? I thought you didn't want to hear anything I've got to say. I don't. What the hell are you doing in there? Mickey : I'm jerking off. Come on in. (Mickey panting) (chuckles) You fucker. (laughs) Yeah. Score. Hey. And... it's Free Joint Friday. Ooh. How about that? (chuckles) Here. Thanks. All this pot, huh? All this pot right out in the open there? Forget the pot, Mickey. You should've seen all the f*cking dough they got in that place. Really? You don't read the papers? See, they got a big cash problem. The banks won't take it 'cause the Feds still say it's illegal. f*cking Feds, man. I know about that. And the safe they keep it in, it's a f*cking Mosler Model 12. (chuckles) It's nothing. Haven't seen one of those since the '70s. No good? Yeah, I could crack that thing. Given the time. You're shittin' me. Where we go down there tonight, drive a f*cking truck up the back, rip the goddamn bars off the windows. Like the cowboy movies. (Laugh) Blast through the f*cking bars. Choom! (chuckles) No, no, no. We go in through the roof. (exhales) You're going in through the roof? Yes. (laughter) (indistinct chatter) Ashley has told me so much about you, Ray. Thank you for coming. Sure. Why am I here? You're angry. You're impatient. But you know it. And you use it, don't you? I love that about you, man. That's how empires are built. Do you know who I am? Do you know what I do? Yeah. You write books. I love that. Simple. Clear. I write books. Do you know what else I do? I love this woman. I'm leaving my wife for her. You know what that means, Ray? No. It means hundreds of millions of dollars. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. Which is why... this is the last thing that I need. (muffled shouting) He interrupted my peak state ritual. I lost control. Do you ever lose control, Ray? I bet you do. Those people out there paid a lot of money, Manuel. They deserve my best. (Manuel shouts) (lock clicks) I did this. I own it. But I need you to fix it. (knocking on door) Man : Steve, five minutes. It's showtime. (chuckles) You let me know if you need anything. Isn't he amazing? (indistinct chatter) Hey. We're not done yet. Excuse us, please. Mm. Right. I don't know you, and I don't work for you, all right? Okay, you're right, Ray. I was very presumptuous. Let's start over. I'm in some trouble here. I need some help. Will you... help me? All right. It's gonna cost you, though. A lot. Bring it. I make promises to this guy, you better be able to back 'em up. How old were you when your mother died, Ray? What? You were young, weren't you? Announcer : And now the person you've all been waiting for, the best-selling author  of Fight for Your Life, Steve Knight! (applause, cheering, upbeat pop intro plays) ♪ In a mystery moment ♪ 
♪ You get something in your mind ♪ 
♪ That gets you thinking maybe ♪ 
♪ You're gonna take them by surprise ♪ 
♪ In your wildest dreaming ♪ 
♪ You woke up to realize ♪ 
♪ That it was in you all along ♪ 
♪ Ready to materialize... ♪ (music, applause fade) Turn off your cell phones. Turn off your iPads. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? (laughter and applause) Now here is one that is going to hurt. For the next five hours, how about we turn off our past, our resentments, all the things that we... cling to... that are keeping us from our truest, most authentic selves. For the rest of the afternoon, we're gonna practice something that I call radical honesty. (cheering and applause) Yeah. Right? Can we do that tonight? This was a one-time thing. No. It can't be. What do you want, Terry? I want to marry you. I want to be with you. And how is that supposed to work? You leave your husband. I get down on a knee. And I'm supposed to forget what happened? You said you were gonna tell me. (sighs) Your brother murdered that priest, didn't he? And you let it happen. That priest raped him. He raped both my brothers. I'm sorry, Terry. (sighs) I don't know what to do. I love you and I want to be with you, but I can't condone murder. And your brother scares me to death. (muffled groaning) (panting) I just deliver his sandwich. He beat me. I don't understand. Where are you from? Sololà. In Guatemala. You got family there? In Guatemala? My wife, my children. (sniffles) (toilet flushes) I got a date tonight. So, what do you want me to do about it? I don't know. I'm just really nervous. I'm a sexual anorexic. What if she wants me to... you know... do it? Wait here. Here. I got some roaches. Hey, you're gonna croak any day now, right? That's what they tell me. Why don't you take out a life insurance policy in my name? I'll pay for it. Someone should benefit when you kick the bucket. (laughs) You got to be kidding. Nobody's gonna sell me a life insurance policy. I have preexisting conditions coming out my ass. (laughs) You could have my pension if we got married. You know that's legal now. The world went f*cking nuts when I was inside. You can buy pot in the strip mall, they got a black guy in the White House, and two men can marry each other. (sighs) Mick? Mm. I got a question. Will you marry me? (both guffawing) 
 
 (phone ringing) Oh, I can't breathe. It's my phone. Ah. Where is it? Oh, I got it. Here. It's ringing. (in a high-pitched voice): Hello? Who is this? Debbie : Hi. Yes, this is Debbie Gerson from Paramount Pictures. I'm trying to reach Mickey Donovan? Shorty (in high-pitched voice) : Debbie Gerson from Paramount? Well, this is Shirley Donovan from Warner Brothers. (laughing) What? (both laughing) Oh. Paramount? Paramount. Give me that. (laughing) Hey. Shh. This is Mickey Donovan. What can I do for you? Terrance told me you got a date. Congratulations. Thanks. Told me you were a little stressed about it, too. Mm. I don't know why he said something like that. Well, sometimes you just need a little something to help you get over the hump, get your confidence back. What is it? Soon as something gonna happen between you and your lady, take it. Well, then what? Pop goes the weasel. I'm an American citizen, señor. I have a lawyer. I'm going to sue Steve Knight. You're not gonna sue Steve Knight, Manuel. What'd you make last year? $30,000. How much of that did you send home? Almost all of it. You ever have a dream, Manuel? If you could do anything you want, money was no object, what would you do? I'd go back to my country, probably buy a football team. (quiet laugh) You're not getting a football team, Manuel... get real. Then I want half-million dollars. $300,000. Seems to me señor has a lot to lose. Yeah, well... you're right about that. All right, Manuel. $350,000. (knocking on door) (door opens) You got two fighters out here want to be trained. I don't feel like training, Pie. You do it. You been holed up in here all day, man. You got to put that woman behind you. I can't. Well, this ain't no way to live. It's goddamn depressing. Now get your sh1t together. This a boxing gym. You're right. (laughing) Where are you going? Ireland. (knocking on door) Yeah, come in. (door opens) You look like sh1t. What do you want? I wanted to invite you and Donna over tonight. We haven't played Scrabble in a while. Uh, sorry, Tom, but, uh, there's not gonna be any more Scrabble. I, uh, just spoke with Megan. She really wants to play. What's wrong? You really hurt Donna's feelings last time, Tom. And she cried. She thinks you don't find her attractive. (sighs) I'm sorry, sir. You know, Tom... when Donna's not happy, I'm not happy. (sighs) (sighs) Okay. (beep) See me? Now, don't laugh... Watch. I was a stripper one summer in Eilat. (singing jaunty tune) Learn something here, okay? Get out of here. That other version of yourself. The pleaser, the nice person. You're wasting your energy! And why? Is that how you want to be described? Is that how you want to be remembered? As nice? (laughter) Guys? Ten minute break. No phones, no texts. Stay on the path. (applause) How did it go, brother? It went fine. Yes! I knew you could handle it. Now, how do I know this isn't going to come back and f*ck me? Manuel's on a flight to Guatemala tonight. He'll be on a no-fly list tomorrow. I want to kneel at your feet. (sighs) Don't do that. I see the god in you, Ray. I have to acknowledge who you are. Come on, get up. Why does my love make you uncomfortable? I don't know, maybe it's the headset... come on. (both laugh) This arrangement is already a winner. Who do I make the check out to? Goldman/Drexter? No. Me. Hundred grand. No problem. A month. Plus what you're paying out to Manuel. What do I get for that? Whatever you need. I'll have my lawyer draft an agreement. You know, those people... they could learn a lot from you, Ray. I'll be in touch. Ray... It's signed. It saved my life. (phone buzzes) Yeah, Av. Avi : Yeah, boss, we have a problem. Will you just get this f*cking equipment out of my house right now? Ray : What's up? It's bad. Yes. I forgot to put my family's from Dingle. Oh. What's prompted you to move to Ireland? I just... I just want to. I need to put down a reason. It's beautiful there. So you've been? No. Oh. I see there you have a preexisting medical condition. I got Parkinson's. We have socialized medicine in Ireland. You're aware of that? No. There are occasions when we've had people attempt to emigrate in order to take advantage... I'm not a freeloader! My fiancée's a nurse. That's very good. Nurse. We need nurses. So, what do you do? Got a boxing gym. You own the business? With my brother. Oh. Well, that is good news. We welcome business owners. Innocent everyman, murder he didn't commit, goes to jail, when a movie star shows up in a helicopter to break him out of the prison yard... I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude. Why was Sean even interested in this? He was interested in me. Go ahead. You have my attention. I consulted on Black Mass. Grew up on the streets of Southie. Started dealing drugs when I was 17 years old. Did 20 years in the can. Walpole. Really? That's right. Was one of Sully Sullivan's closest associates. There's already ten Sully projects already going. We actually just dropped ours. What else you got? Well, they say, write about what you know? I know two things. Robbing banks and f*cking black chicks. (laughs) Let's see where that goes. (Steve on audiobook): this minute that's getting in your way, that's keeping you from being your authentic self... Own it. Run right to it. Stop listening to the voice... (CD ejecting) (phone chimes) (phone line ringing) (over phone): Hey, this is Abby Donovan. I can't answer your call. Please leave a message. (voice-mail beeps) Hey, it's me. I, uh... I should have told you about Bridget. I should have told you about a lot of things. Look, I've... I've been really nuts trying to get this house, Abs, and I know that's not an excuse, but... meet me tonight for dinner. Sofia's. 8:30. I'll be there. Frances! Fran... Excuse me. Can I help you? Yeah, uh, it's okay. It's okay. What are you doing? Are you trying to get me fired? What is this? What? It's the Immigrant Investor Program. Ireland? Yeah, Ireland. I'm gonna sell my gym. They need business owners like me. They need nurses, too. Terry... Let me finish. $687,200. Okay. We start a business with that, we can become citizens immediately. You are out of your mind. Frances. Frances, please. I have a family. I have a son. Jason's 18. He's going off to college. You'll only see him once a year anyway. But he can come visit us. Every summer. I'll rent a castle. I can't decide this right now, okay? I-I need to think about it. Christ, I have a patient in the other room! You don't love your husband. You love me. You said that. Oh, my God. You're the love of my life. Come to Ireland. Come to Ireland and marry me. (knocking on door) He says the plan is off. Take your microphones and your cameras... get 'em out of my walls, please. What happened? Cochran said no. It's not gonna work. Why not? It's Donna. She knows that I don't like making love to her, and... offended her. (quiet chuckle) He told you that? It's not funny. So just get your sh1t and get out of here. I mean it. Tom, listen to me. Sooner or later, Cochran's gonna get bored with the two of you and move on. When that happens, you think he wants you hanging around to remind him? Huh? But Megan and I are gonna be on that tape. I told you, we take care of that. Blur your faces. You're a smart guy, Tom. There's only one play here. f*ck him before he f*cks you. Now pick up that phone and call her. (phone rings) Hello? Hey, it's Tom. Don't hang up, please. What do you want? Look, I know that sometimes, in the past, it's felt like maybe I was holding back. But there's a reason. Yeah, what is it? This is hard for me to say, but... You remind me of a girl. From high school. We were in love and... she broke my heart. Well, sorry about that. Well, it... it isn't fair, letting it affect you. (whispers): You want to f*ck her. Please forgive me, but... I really want to f*ck you. Tonight. Really, sweetie? 'Cause I really want to f*ck you, too. Where you going? Out. I'm really sorry about this morning, Mama. I was really angry. I accept your apology. Jesus, that feels good. (chuckles) Doesn't it? Okay... I'm gonna rinse. Keep your eyes closed, okay? I'm gonna dry you off. Okay. Okay. How do you feel now? Better than I've felt in a long time. Yeah? Yeah. Uh... Can I use your bathroom? Oh, yeah, yeah. It's, uh, it's right there. Okay. Okay. Hey, Ray. Hey. Saw that you were coming in. Meeting my wife. This way. Thanks. Sure. (rustling) (door closes) Clifford : Mom, I'm home. Patty : Cliff, honey... honey, what are you doing here? Is everything okay? No, no, no. No. (knocking on door) (clears throat) Yeah? Hey. Cliff's home. He wet the bed. I'm so sorry. Timing could have been a lot worse. (laughs) Yeah. Cliff, honey, let's take a little bath and put some PJs on. You remember Bunchy. Say hi. Hi. I had an accident. Okay. That's all right. Come on. Let's get you out of those clothes. (growls playfully) One, two, three. It says here... "the hero always crosses water" "in the beginning." Really? "They did it" "with Moses," "King Arthur..." "and 'O-ED-I-PUS.'" I did dump a body in the Boston Harbor once. (chuckles) That's your opening. Ray's gonna learn... can't hold me down. You know, Sean Walker said that every page is supposed to be a minute, but I can't see how that's true. With this opening I'm gonna have three... three scenes on the first page. Every one seems like it's gonna be at least a minute. This is too hard. Why don't we do that heist? We could go in through the roof. See, that I understand. Not this pipe dream. Pipe dream?! Get the f*ck out of here, pipe dream. It's as real as your cancer. (sighs) (door closes) sh1t. (on TV): Okay, you asked for it. (alien grunting on TV) (soft laugh) (on TV): Now Cosmic Kevin is gonna make you pay! (alien grunts) Banana peel kick! (Kevin laughing) Chicken drumstick kick. Alien : Oh! (cartoon continues indistinctly) (phone keypad blipping) (line rings) Hey, this is Abby Donovan. I can't answer your call. Please leave a message. (phone beeps off) Hey, Ray. Hi. Can I get you anything else? No, thank you. Let me know if you change your mind. (laughs) Oh, mister, you're almost done. Not until you hit a bull's-eye. (scoffs) Threw me off. I should get a do-over. Am I really that distracting? Maybe, yeah. You're so f*cking beautiful. Holy sh1t. (passionate breathing over speakers) Cochran : Yeah. Oh, yeah. (phone buzzes quietly) (passionate moaning) Oh, yeah... Yeah? Harriet : We have a problem. What? I just got a call from your brother. He wants to sell the gym, Ray. What are you talking about? I just spoke to him. It's something about moving to Ireland. You told me this day would never come. You promised me. I'll take care of it. Goddamn it, Ray, now this is my ass on the line, too.
