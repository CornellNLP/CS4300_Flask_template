 Terry :  He got out. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The old man made parole. 
 You go near my family, I'll f*cking kill you. 
 Why does he hate you so much? 
 I was a terrible father. 
 I've done my time, Abby. 
 I guess that's not enough for Ray. 
 Did he say how they got in the house? 
 It's your father, right? 
 What are we gonna do about him, Raymond? 
 Sean : How did he breach my security? 
 I need the tapes, Sean. 
 Avi : Who is that? 
 My brother. 
 Oh, there's someone in the car. 
 Avi :  You're the boxer, right? 
 Yeah, that's me. What's up? 
 (screaming) 
 Bridget : Hey, how come they didn't have any kids? 
 Abby : Terry's got Parkinson's, honey. 
 Why didn't Bunchy have kids? 
 He got molested by a priest when they were little. 
 (gun fires) 
 Ray :  Check Boston homicide. 
 Lena :  There was a priest killed in a church in south Boston.

 Abby : Five f*cking days, Ray? 
 Seriously? 
 What am I supposed to tell the kids when they ask why you're not home, huh? 
 You think you're punishing me, you're punishing your kids. 
 This is over Mickey, right? 
 'Cause I let the kids spend a few hours with their grandfather? 
 You know what, Ray? It was a good day. 
 The kids had a great time. 
 So did I. 
 He's an old man. 
 He just wants to... have some family in his life. 
 Will you talk to me? 
 Ezra's party's tonight. 
 I want to see you there. 
 Buy something nice. 
 You gonna treat me like a whore? 
 I am your f*cking wife. 
 You're not gonna talk to me, Ray? Huh? 
 Oh, just go back to your fancy apartment and pretend we don't exist, huh?

 Yeah. Why?

 We're gonna see that lawyer today. 
 Uh, I don't know, Ray. 
 You don't know what? 
 Is that Ray? 
 Come on, Bunch. 
 You got to pick up your check today and... take care of that other thing we talked about. 
 You know how you start your mornings in prison? 
 Watching your cell mate take a sh1t. 
 Bunch, listen to me. I'm on my way to the gym. 
 I'll be there in an hour. Meet me downstairs.

 I could cry thinking about that sweet black ass of hers. 
 Cross. All right.

 Hey, lighten up! 
 My boys don't lighten up.

 He's a boxer. 
 Hi. 
 Hi there. 
 Um, I want to make a donation. 
 Oh, that's wonderful. Are you a member of St. Vincent's? 
 No. I don't go to church. I... 
 I mean, I should. I-I've been thinking about it lately, but... 
 I go to yoga. 
 Wow. 
 These look expensive. 
 And practically new. 
 Armani? Zegna? 
 Father, you know Zegna?

 I do know they're worth a lot of money. 
 Are you sure you want to donate these? 
 Yeah, I do.

 You picked him up at Walpole? 
 Yeah. Drove him over to St. Mary's. 
 He didn't say a word the entire way. 
 He'd just, you know, look out the window. 
 He went inside? 
 Yeah, he was in there-- 
 I don't know-- five minutes, tops. 
 Come out. I drove him over to a motel on Western Avenue. 
 You know he killed a priest. 
 Did you talk to the police? 
 What the f*ck business do I got talking to the cops about anything? 
 (coughs) 
 I could make it your business. 
 Nah. They might think that... 
 I knew what he was planning to do. 
 That-that would make me an accomplice. 
 (chuckles) 
 Why should I take that kind of risk? 
 You know, you talk funny. 
 Where were you born? 
 You don't want to know. 
 Better? 
 It's okay. 
 The drugs will kick in any sec. 
 Did I do this to you? 
 That's all I want to know. 
 That last fight in Worcester-- pretty rough, you took a lot of punches. 
 Did I keep you in the game too long? 
 'Cause if I did, give me a gun. 
 Blow my brains out right now. 
 It's all right, Mick. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I did this. 
 No one knows what causes it. 
 There's lots of factors. 
 Oh, all right, good. 
 Makes jerking off easier, right? 
 Can we have a minute alone? 
 Sure. 
 I don't want to be a third wheel. 
 (Mickey sighs) 
 (door shuts) 
 Is he for real? 
 He's all right. 
 How's that? 
 Is that better? 
 I'm sorry about the mess. 
 Oh. (chuckles) 
 I've seen worse. 
 Yeah? 
 Sure. 
 You know, I used to be a hooker before I was a nurse. 
 (chuckles) 
 I'm kidding. 
 (chuckles) 
 Someone's got to mean a lot, I guess, if you're gonna... wear her name on your body forever. 
 Unless you were drunk when you got it. 
 I wasn't drunk. 
 I'm feeling better. 
 What do I owe you? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 Your brother took care of it. 
 I'm not a charity case. 
 You're done here, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm done. 
 (exhales) 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 I'll see you then. 
 He okay? 
 He's hurting, but it'll ease up. 
 Your brother's a stubborn b*st*rd. 
 He's a good guy, though. 
 The best. 
 Thanks for the cash. 
 I can use it. 
 No problem. 
 I moved the lawyer to this afternoon. 
 Why don't you come with me? 
 We can hang out till the appointment. 
 It's dirty money, Ray, you know? 
 The church is going broke with all these lawsuits.

 There's the... there's the half nelson. 
 See? Like that. 
 There's the full nelson. 
 And there's the Father Nelson.

 You take life too f*cking serious, Ray. 
 Smile and the world smiles with you. 
 Cry and you cry alone. 
 Speaking of priests... you killed the wrong one, Mick. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The priest that molested Bunchy? 
 They moved him out of that parish ten years ago. 
 (snorts, chuckles) 
 You killed his brother, you moron. 
 So what? 
 He didn't f*ck my boy, he f*cked someone else's. 
 Let's go. 
 (mumbling): Look... 
 I-I got my SNAP meeting. 
 Dad's... coming with me. 
 You know how many times I asked you to come with me, Ray? 
 I got to support my kid. 
 That's what fathers are for. 
 Ezra : It's a groundbreaking celebration! 
 I want little shovels! 
 Is that too much to ask? 
 Raymond, shut the door. 
 What's going on, Ezra? 
 The golem's arrived. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Listen, Ezra... 
 I think we should make an appointment with a doctor. 
 Are you sick? 
 Your father called three times. 
 You didn't talk to him, did you? 
 Do you think I'm crazy? 
 I thought we took care of him. 
 All right. Calm down. 
 I am taking care of it. 
 How?

 Four DUIs last year. 
 Two months ago, he tried to go through L.A.X. with an Uzi. 
 An Uzi. 
 Three record companies are suing him. 
 The hours we can bill! 
 And his little protégé? 
 Gonna be the black Justin Bieber. 
 Word. 
 Oh, one problem. 
 We got to get total control, all parental rights. 
 So, Ray, you got to buy the kid. 
 We're buying kids now, Lee? 
 We've done worse. 
 (door shuts) 
 This is my legacy, Raymond. 
 My tribute to Ruth. 
 Your father's going to ruin it. 
 I became withdrawn. 
 I quit all my sports. 
 I was a, uh, 12-year-old with post-traumatic stress and they just didn't notice? 
 Bullshit. They noticed. 
 They were just too damn afraid to do anything about it. 
 Afraid of the priest, afraid of their... beloved holy Catholic Church, afraid of the f*cking Pope. 
 So they just let it happen. 
 (voice cracking): They just f*cking let it happen. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Wow. 
 God bless you. 
 You was all abused? 
 All of you? 
 Ain't that something, huh?

 Guy comes home from work and finds that his girlfriend is packing to leave. 
 She's upset about something. 
 And he says, uh, "Honey, what's wrong?" And she says, "Today I found out you're a pedophile." 
 He says, "Pedophile? 
 Whoa, that's a big word for an eight-year-old."

 Mickey : Yeah, you get it. 
 Yeah.

 Well...

 Lena (over phone) : Yo. Where you headed? 
 Compton. 
 What's in Compton? 
 Someone's mother. 
 Hey, Lena, you know that, uh, rapper, my neighbor? 
 Yeah. Re-Kon. 
 I want you to check him out. 
 See if he's ever had s*x with a minor. 
 Hurt a kid, anything like that. 
 You hear from Avi? 
 Yeah, he says the guy's playing games, but he'll probably do it for more money. 
 Tell him to do whatever it takes.

 Yeah, Terry, what's up? 
 How's the arm?

 Man : Is there anger inside? 
 Disappointment? 
 Inhale. Deeply. 
 Gather that anger, and when you exhale, just let it go.

 Inhale again. 
 Gather that anger. 
 And when you exhale, just let it go.

 And this is a durable power of attorney form. 
 It authorizes your brother to make decisions for you regarding your finances.

 It means I'm gonna help you.

 He says you sent him to prison. 
 Bunch... 
 Did you? 
 Come on, Bunch. 
 Let's put this money somewhere safe. 
 Make sure you're all right. 
 He says you framed him. 
 Bunch, please. 
 Come on. 
 Let me help you. 
 I'm doing this for your own good, I swear. 
 (door opens) 
 (softly): "...Queequeg had handled so roughly, "was swept overboard; 
 "all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness." 
 The whale wins. 
 Who the f*ck are you? 
 I'm the guy that got you out of prison. 
 I got myself out of prison. 
 You were supposed to do five more years. 
 What are you? FBI? 
 You know how many punks would have wanted to kill me in Walpole if they knew what I fed you people? 
 Practically sh1t myself every time I took a shower. 
 I gave you Sully's gang. 
 What the f*ck else do you want? 
 You didn't give us Sully. 
 He's still out there. 
 The guy's a f*cking Houdini. 
 What can I do? 
 Anyways... that's the past. 
 I got a new life now. 
 I know. 
 You've been busy. 
 What do you want? 
 I'll let you know. 
 This ain't enough. 
 More next time. 
 (laughs) 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Take care, Mick. 
 (exhales sharply) 
 (phone rings) 
 Hey, Avi, what's up? Are we on? 
 Yeah. He'll I.D. Mickey for 50 K. 
 Do it. 
 It's a lot of cash. Boss? 
 I need to know the minute it's done. 
 Okay, you got it. 
 Got another call. 
 Yeah, Lena, what's up? 
 Okay, Re-Kon's checked out. 
 Your meet's set. 
 I'll see you outside Ezra's party. 
 (knocking) 
 Bridget : Mom? 
 Uh-huh? 
 Uh, there's a limo downstairs. 
 A limo? 
 With a driver. 
 Daddy sent it for you.

 Oh! 
 Ray motherfucking Donovan, y'all! 
 The man of the hour! 
 (music stops) 
 Get rid of them. 
 Hey, ladies, step outside while I talk to Mr. Donovan. 
 All right. 
 So, what you think, Ray? 
 Think I'm gonna get the kid? 
 Got to sort some things out first. 
 What she want? 
 What I want. 
 You ever been a father before, Re-Kon? 
 (chuckles) Nah, man. 
 Keep my sh1t wrapped tight all the time. 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hold up, Ray. 
 Look... all right, what you want? 
 First, the kid goes to school. 
 Done. 
 You keep him away from drugs. 
 Drugs, yeah, (chuckles) but not the reefer. 
 Artists can't create without the reefer, baby. 
 Drugs. 
 (sighs) 
 All right. 
 You make sure no one f*cks around with him. 
 You understand me? 
 Oh, man. 
 I don't even get down in that type of scene. 
 You kidding me? 
 Yo, I love the kids. 
 sh1t, I got my own foundation. 
 All right. 
 Drexler will call you. 
 I'm a father! Whoo! 
 Oh, man! 
 Thank you, Ray Donovan! 
 Whoo, man! 
 Whoa, hold up. 
 Yo, we straight, right? 
 Like, I mean, I ain't got to worry about her changing her mind? 
 She won't change her mind. 
 Hey, Ray, thank you, thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 Ray! 
 Hey, how are you? 
 I'm okay. 
 Where's Ezra? 
 Praying at the shrine. 
 Excuse me. 
 Ezra. 
 Oyf farshemen zikh. 
 You all right? 
 Mickey called me. 
 You told me to trust you. 
 This is great, Ezra. 
 A real tribute to Ruth. 
 I'm literally moved to tears. 
 Ray, Hanukah with the crack mom? 
 Are we gonna make my new homey client happy? 
 Why don't you go get a drink, Lee? 
 I meant what I said, Ezra. 
 You can trust me. 
 I do. 
 You showed up. 
 Did I have any choice? 
 A f*cking limo? (chuckles) 
 Driver? 
 Don't start. Come on. 
 You look nice. 
 Thank you. 
 (applause) 
 Welcome! Welcome. 
 Tonight is a blessing. 
 Next week, we break ground for the Ruth Goldman Ovarian Cancer Center. 
 Paying tribute to Ruth. 
 She was a wonderful woman. 
 (chuckling): Yeah, wonderful. 
 I often felt that she was an angel. 
 Angel? Do you want to know about Ruth? 
 She was so giving, so generous. 
 Ruth the saint, Ruth the holy. 
 Deb, hi. 
 Ezra : She loved everyone. 
 Let's get some air. 
 She was no angel, believe me. 
 She was sleeping with her shrink for years. 
 There was nothing she wouldn't do for anyone. 
 Years! 
 I see this center as my legacy. 
 Ruth would want that. 
 A legacy... is important. 
 Especially when you've done terrible things. 
 Not to be spoken of. 
 There's a price to pay for the wrong that we do. 
 A terrible... price. 
 Baruch attah Adonai... eloheynu melekh haolam... 
 (Lee applauding) 
 Ve-al tashlet banu yetser hara...  Thank you. 
 Thanks for your support. 
 What a great night. 
 (Deb sighs) 
 (Deb retching) 
 Oh, God. 
 Come here. 
 I made such a fool of myself. 
 No, it's all right. 
 Wipe your face. 
 (food sizzling, low indistinct conversations) 
 (bell dings twice) 
 (low conversations) 
 I just want to say I gave Ray the money. 
 Nobody pays for me-- 
 I pay for myself. 
 Just want to make that clear. 
 Hello to you, too. 
 Hello. 
 So, this is about the money? 
 I don't know. 
 It's what it is. 
 That's a nice shirt for a business transaction. 
 I'm a clean man. 
 This isn't how it's done. 
 What? 
 Asking someone for a date. 
 This isn't how you do it. 
 Fine. 
 (short laugh) 
 You like spaghetti? 
 Sure. 
 Good. 
 (laughs) 
 (Ray sighs) 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah, Avi? 
 Yeah, it's done. 
 Your father's getting sent back to prison. 
 They took his statement? 
 Yeah. They want him to come back in a couple of days, look at photos, but it's... happening. 
 Thanks. 
 No problem. 
 (sighs) 
 Bunch? 
 (door closes) 
 Come on out here, Bunch. 
 We got company. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Right this way. 
 You lovely ladies, uh, know how to twerk? 
 Yeah, sure we do. 
 Of course. 
 Mickey : Let's see. 
 Whoa-ho-ho... Bunch? 
 This is my son, Bunchy. 
 Bunch. Hey, Bunch. Hi, Bunchy. 
 Show him a little twerk, Cinderella. 
 She's an artist who makes you the hardest. 
 (both laughing) 
 He'll warm up. 
 He'll warm up. 
 This is a gymnasium. 
 Infinite possibilities.
