How many f*cking times your grandma die? Cual : That last one was my step-grandma, bro. This one's the real one. And I helped pay for her coffin. Take it out of his winnings, pie. Winnings? What winnings? This pussy couldn't win a coin toss. You're in a mood. I'm sick of being broke. You got a job. We barely break even. You let every kid come in here scam you. They sign the deal. We get a piece of the action. Action? We haven't had a decent fighter in years. All these weird guys Bunchy bring in. Those sad cats crying in the locker room. Here. You're feeling tight, here you go. This is what I'm talking about, Terence. You're too goddamn soft for your own good. What you cooking for this lady, man? Spaghetti. You ain't gonna get laid with this sh1t, man. She told me she liked spaghetti. Can't get pussy from sh1t on a jar. You got to make it from scratch. f*ck all, who raised you anyway?

(Phone ringing) He still hangs out with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell sometimes. Kurt Russell  and  Goldie Hawn? Mm-hmm. Give me a second. Yeah. Van : Where are you? Beautiful Palm Springs. You need to let me know when you leave town, Mickey. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Because it's part of our deal. I didn't know that. There's a lot you don't know, Mickey. A lot I didn't tell you. And there's something I didn't tell you, Van. What's that? Go f*ck yourself. What do you think, you're gonna kiss her? (Gargles) You never know. Hey, listen, just so you guys know, my step-dad is a f*cking dickhead. Got a doorbell there. Behave yourself. (Sighs) Daryll. Allan. You must be Mickey. That's right. Come on in. And this is my son Bunchy. Here. How are you? Oh. Thank you... Mickey. I wanted to thank you for taking care of Daryll while I was in the joint. Oh. Eh. Mickey. Look at you. Jesus. Claudette. (Chuckles) Claudette, you look great. Oh. You haven't changed a bit. That's nice of you to say that. Black don't crack. Oh. (Chuckles) Come on in, guys. Uh, can I offer you a, uh, beer? Some lemonade? Come on in. It's so beautiful. I mean, my God. Do you know where your father and I went to school? Ah, come on. Southie. Broken windows, all the desks had graffiti on them. Yeah, Southie. We know, mom. Will you look at this place? Why am I so nervous? Relax. You're the best looking woman here. (Quietly): What's he doing here? sh1t. Uh, th-this is the time that we're... what? Ray. I mean, you don't call, you don't write. I mean, what am I... (Chuckles) Hello, Stu. Hello, Abby. You look lovely today. And these are your... Kids, right? Yeah. My son goes here. Oh, yeah? Yeah. He's leading the tours. Jamie, get over here. Just drop her. What? Dr-drop her and do him instead. (Sighs) Okay, kid. Come on with me. We're gonna sign in. All right. All right. Come here. That crazy c**t Ashley... why I keep f*cking her, ah, I can't explain. What's the problem, Stu? You know, when I tell her I'm leaving my wife, she actually believes me. Yeah, she's bat-shit crazy, even for an actress. Singer. What-whatever the f*ck she is. But two nights ago, right... She breaks into my house and leaves a note for me in the goddamn kitchen. Freaked out my wife. You think I need full-time security now or what, you know? No. You gonna take care of this for me? I'm not working today, Stu. (Sighs heavily) Want to go in? Yeah. Let's go. What did he want? Relationship advice. (Snickers) Here at bel air academy, on a daily basis, we dwell in possibility. We meet our students afresh every day and ask them to step up to the smorgasbord of learning and then watch as they assemble the toolkits for their futures. Our students are well-rounded achievers... (Whispers): Can you believe this? (Whispers): Yeah, looks great. Artistic and scientific. (Mouthing) Bel air graduates have made a significant contribution to our country. (Cell phone vibrating) Turn it off. (Vibrating stops) Ray. And our wonderful faculty is the bedrock of our success, inspiring our students to build their own lives... What's going on, Avi? Yeah, they're in Palm Springs. What the f*ck are they doing there? Visiting some rich guy and his black wife. Claudette. You think he's gonna run? I need him back in L.A. for the warrant. But what if he doesn't come back to L.A.? We need him back in L.A., Av. Okay, Ray. (Sighs) How's it feel to be out, Mick? Great. Back with my family, where I belong. Leave that sh1t alone. Knock it off. I've been saving this bottle of cognac for years. 1946. Very rare. Mickey : How much does a bottle like that set you back? Well, you know the old saying: If you have to ask, you can't afford it. I know the saying. Cost me $2,000 when I bought it back in '95. What is this, like, oil in your hair? Touching me... it's product. Product? I'm not telling you again. It's him. It's gross. This one's not having any. He's, uh, sober. Though he doesn't act it. Allan : The secret to happiness... Is freedom. Here's to your new life, Mick. f*cking good toast, Allan. Thank you. (Sighs) Sip it, Daryll. Come on. Take it easy. He flips from the fire escape, pulls out the pistol from the cop's holster and shoots three guys dead. And all in his underwear, because he was making out with that chick when the bad guys found him. Tommy Wheeler is badass. Hey, guys, Tommy Wheeler's, like, one of my best friends. Tommy Wheeler? Bullshit. I'm serious. My dad works with him, and we talk all the time. No f*cking way. I can prove it. That could be anyone. It's not though. I could call him right now and he'd pick up. Do it then. Yeah. Do it. Come on. Go ahead. Nah, mm-mm. Put it on speaker. (Line ringing) Tommy : Little dude, what's up? Hey, Tommy. Just looking for a new school and sh1t. Cool. Did you see my movie yet? Nope, not yet, but I'm gonna. Well, come to my house, and I'll screen it for you. Tell your dad. Okay. I got to go. Okay, little man. See ya. Bye. Did, uh... Tommy Wheeler suck your dick yet? What? My dad produces his movies. Says he's a degenerate homo. So if Tommy wants to hang out with you, he's just trying to get into your pants. He's a total perv. (Boys chuckling, murmuring) Man : I'm sure most of you took the requisite Shakespeare courses in college. Our curriculum begins with  Hamlet. After all, he was a teenager who hated his mother and stepfather. (Parents chuckling, cell phone vibrating) After Hamlet, we move on to  Romeo and Juliet...  more teenage angst. Uh, it's an easier sell before we move on to the histories. We start with the English histories, do  Richard II, Henry V. And if that doesn't kill them, we're gonna move on to the Roman histories next. We're gonna have  coriolanus, Julius Caesar. Of course, at that point, they'll be begging for nonstop  Simpsons  reruns. (Parents chuckling) Girl :  So, basically,  they have to accept me because of my father. But I still have to take that stupid entrance exam. Oh, my God, I know. I had two private teachers last time, and I still totally tanked. (Laughs) Are you flying to Aspen for the holiday? No. I get  so  airsick flying out of Santa Monica airport. I know! My ears go crazy and all the food platters fall. (Groans) Do you go to Aspen? Uh, no. Oh, my God. Are those keds? Yeah. Yes. You are so lucky. My mother refuses to buy them for me because she thinks they don't have arch support. (Chuckles) Yeah. You must have really good feet. Maybe. Thanks. Where do you go to school? Calabasas. Oh, my God. (Laughs) What? You are so lucky. No one would even know you here. You could, like, be anyone. (Quietly): Hmm. Terry : Dip, slip, punch. Sit down in your punches. Okay, boss, you tell me. Yeah, it's good. Good? My aunt keithie taught me how to make this. She was a ugly woman with tits that hung down to her belly button. I said it was good. And she was mean as hell. But she cooked so good that she actually got six men to marry her. So? So... If this recipe got my aunt keithie laid, it should work for you, too. Keep your eyes on the target. You're very f*cking welcome. Time! (Makes whooshing sounds) You wanna go? You wanna go? Let's do this, huh? Get out of here. Come on. (Laughs) f*ck! (Laughs) Jesus, Bunch! You got my f*cking hair wet! So what? So what?! I got product in it! I told you that! What's your problem? Bunch! You m*therf*cker! f*cking asshole, I told you I didn't want to get wet! Come on. Come on. Come on. Huh? Cut it out, man. So, you're a movie producer, huh? Mm-hmm. Ever make anything good? Good? (Chuckles) I don't know about that. Made a hell of a lot of f*cking money though, if that's what you're asking. If you ever need a great idea, I got one. Yeah? Oh, yeah. I got a f*cking doozy in my head. Just need someone to spill it out to. What's it about? It's about some guy... Who did 20 years for no good f*cking reason. I heard about that, Mick. You here for the money? What money? (Laughs) Claudette and I have no secrets from each other. I know all about Boston. I know about the money you gave her, and I know where you got it. Yeah? Mm-hmm. I'm prepared to pay you back. If? You know the if, Mick. You get your money and you move on down the road. It ain't the money I'm after, Allan. You two having a good time? Mm-hmm. Come here. Come here. Look-look at this. Ray's family. They're beautiful! They can't get enough of me. Who'd have thought, huh? Oh... (Chuckles) Excuse me. Woman : Don't f*cking move! Man : Ah, yeah! Woman : Don't move! 
 
 (Bed creaking) (Woman gasps) There... oh, God, there it is. (Moaning) Don't move! (Gasps) Make... me... f*cking... Feel good! (Moaning loudly) (Shrieks) What the f*ck's that, Teddy?! Teddy : What?! Oh, sh1t. What the f*ck is that? Woman : I don't know. sh1t. (Line ringing) Come on, Ray. (Phone vibrating) Turn it off. So what do you think? About? You want to go steady? My mom says you're gonna lead me down the wrong path. All right, so don't tell your mom. Okay. But I'm a good catholic girl. Everything's got to be over my sweater. I can do that. Man : Hey. It's Ray Donovan. Errand boy for Ezra Goldman. You mind? Trying to have a cup of coffee with my wife. So, you, uh, you bringing your kids around here to run errands, too? Pick up the tRays after lunch, maybe extort lunch money from the other kids? Who the f*ck do you think you are?! Whoa, whoa. It's all right. You don't... Talk to my husband like that. Listen, I'm being nice 'cause we're in a nice place. Understand me? Doesn't work like that around here, Ray. You can't just threaten people... Get what you want. (Phone vibrating) I'll be right back. Ray... My therapist said I should apologize to you. Your therapist? What I said to you about Ray f*cking my girlfriend... it was totally untrue. I was acting out my guilt over having an affair with a... a young girl. A beautiful young girl. I was acting it out on you, and that was deeply wrong. And I apologize. Thank you. (Chuckles) For your apology. You're welcome. And I'll put in a good word about your kids. You know, just make sure things work out. Good. Good, good, good, good. This... this feels good, doesn't it? Right. How long ago did this happen? Lena : Uh, about ten minutes. Who'd she call? She called the concierge and then she called her lawyer. All right, I'll be right there. All right. Want me to call Ezra? No, don't bother him. I'll take care of it. You hotel security? Yeah. It's over here. I think it's a microphone. Yeah, that's a microphone. Strangest thing. It just fell down from behind the picture. I mean, I didn't know who to call. What is this, like, some CIA type of sh1t? This whole room is wired? How do you know where everything is? Excuse me. Can I see your I.D.? What are you...? What the f*ck you doing, man?! f*cking scumbag! (Groans) Sit. f*ck! You fucker! (Grunts) You're gonna ruin my goddamn life! (Grunts) (Shrieks) (Groans) Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop! Stop! Look at me! Look at me! Listen to me. I am a human being. Do you ever think about the things that you do? Listen. Do yourself... You b*st*rd! Lena : Hey. Get to your room. No, I'm sorry, wait, wait! I'll pay you! I'll do anything, I'll do anything! Calm down. Get to your room. Get to your room. Oh, f*ck you! Shut up. You okay? Yeah. sh1t. All right. We got to get out of here. Go. Bel air academy costs $33,000 a year in tuition. We have a $10 million scholarship fund for students who can prove need. So, please, don't let our price tag stop you from applying. Questions? Mickey :  Looks like you landed on your feet. You gave me a head start, Mickey. And I'll be forever grateful. Claudette... Come on. I got something for you. Oh. Uh-huh. You do, huh? Yeah. Jesus. Pa-dow! You kept it. Here's your other beautiful black baby. Ain't that something. Ain't that something! Mm-hmm. Holy sh1t. My Sansui speakers! And there's more. Let's see if it's alive. (Engine starts, stereo playing R&B music) And more. (Chuckles): Oh, well... What are you gonna do? You like what you like.

Yeah, three or four chords, but nothing like you. You like this place, don't you? I do, daddy. If I applied, do you think I'd get in? (Scoffs) I think they'd be lucky to have you, that's what I think. Daddy, wt happened to your face? It's nothing. But... Don't worry about it. It's nothing? Nothing. Come on. Whatever you say. Big cat scratched me. (Laughs) A bobcat, maybe. One of those bel air cougars. He hit me. I know he did. I did not. He hit me! Conor, is this true? I don't know what he's talking about. Jamie : He's a liar! He's a f*cking liar! He hit me! Do something about it. Stu : All right, Jamie, just calm down. So tell me exactly what happened. I already did. We were walking off the yard when this fucker hit me with something. Well, I'm-I'm sure it was an accident. Jamie : Just an accident, my ass. Ray : Conor? I'm only gonna ask you once. Did you hit him? Yeah, I hit him. And I don't give a sh1t! He's a f*cking asshole! Come on, bridget. Let's just go home. Stu : What the f*ck, Ray? Walk away! Don't show your face here again, bitch! Why'd you let him hit you? I didn't f*cking see him. He came up from behind me. (Piano playing jazz music) (Sighs) Means a lot to me... you boys coming out here with me. It means a lot.

First thing you do when you get out is kill a priest. Are you  trng  to go back to prison? Is that what you want? (Water runs, stops) I can take care of it, but you got to work with me.
