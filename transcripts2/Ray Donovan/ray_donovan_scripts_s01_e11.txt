 Bunchy :  Father Danny-- he's here in L.A. 
 I seen him. 
 Remember me? It's Brendan. We don't know each other. I'm sorry. Are you? Ray said you'd stolen a lot of money from Sully. I did it for this chick,  Claudette, my one true love. Mick, things have changed. Ray :  You got photos of Van Miller tripping his balls off, hair samples, video. What the f*ck are you waiting for? Frank :  I'm doing it now. I still remember her looking up at me. Before you pulled the trigger? (over headphones): Yeah. MICKEY:  Let me get this straight. No one else knows about this? Van :  I couldn't risk it. Mickey :  I'm surprised I could f*ck you. You're really not my type. I just needed some closure on this with you. (quiet sobbing) So, how'd you find me? Ray found  me. You got the wrong guy, pal. What are you talking about? Seany boy, are you in there? I got a great idea for the ending. Let me in. Tv newsman :  A body has been found. It is believed to be the body of Sean Walker. Shame about Sean Walker. There's a lunatic on the loose. What'd you do? What did  you  do? Raymond, what did  you  do? ♪ Ray Donovan 1x11 ♪ Bucky f*ckin' Dent Original Air Date on September 15, 2013 ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Do you think Sully's coming for us? Who the hell knows what he's gonna do? You got what you need? Yeah. (sighs) I need you to stay with the family till you hear from me. (sighs) Don't let 'em out of your sight, all right? Thanks, Av. Ezra :  I made the arrangements  for this baby to come into the world. And now she's an orphan. She has a mother. That girl who walked behind Sean carrying a clipboard? An egg donor is not a mother. Deb and I are the legal guardians. But I'm not well. And Deb's too old to take care of a baby. Kelly? Kelly? (baby crying) Take her, please. Okay. Take her. Okay. It's okay. Mr. Drexler wants to know if you'd like to issue a statement. Uh, yeah, my client's dead, I'm in mourning. (baby crying) That's my statement. (baby continues crying) This is a f*cking tragedy. We've unleashed a monster. Sully's not getting any younger. He doesn't have a passport; I'll find him. Your father's still working for the FBI. I'm working on that. How? Will you give me a f*cking break, Ezra? I'm doing what I can. Don't talk to me like that, Raymond. We're both upset. Let's not fight. I know I'm asking you to do a horrible thing. I'm not killing my father. Sooner or later, he's gonna get caught-- or Sully-- and it's gonna come back to us. Our problems didn't go away. They got worse. (sighs) (phone ringing) Yeah. The next words out of your mouth better be "Van Miller is shut down and no longer working for the FBI." I gave my ASAC the file, Ray. I'm waiting. Waiting for what? We're a little busy right now dealing with a dead Sean f*cking Walker. Course, I'm sure you know all about that. What's that supposed to mean? You tell me. Van told me he was investigating you for some murder involving Walker. At first I thought it was one of Van's paranoid Hollywood fantasies, but now... You're an enemy, Frank. I'm gonna come over there and pay your ASAC a visit. Tell him about all the great service I've been getting from you. If I'm going to prison, you're going with me. (beep) f*ck. (sighs) Yeah, hey, I need to speak to you. Yeah, it's important. (siren wailing in distance) (siren approaching) (knocking) (siren passing) (knocking) (knocking) (passing truck horn blows) (smacks lips) What are you, Jehovah's Witnesses? LAPD. You Mickey Donovan? In the flesh. We'd like to ask you a few questions about Sean Walker. We, uh, found your name in his appointment book. You were working for him? Was working with him. We had an overall deal. Now I guess... that's f*cked. Come in, fellas. I'll make some Sanka. (car horn beeps) (moaning, panting) God! Oh, God, I missed you. I missed this. (grunts): Oh... Wh-What the f*ck, Bunch?! I f*cked up. I f*cked up real bad. Jesus. (ringtone playing) Yeah, Terry, what's up? You need to get over here. Something's happened. Christ, Ter, I can't do it. I'm sorry! I need you here. Now. (click) (quietly): sh1t. Conor : Big football fan. Avi : So, what, do you like the Galaxy? Conor : Yeah, Galaxy sucks without Beckham. (laughs) Beckham's a putz. Mr. Hollywood. What are you doing here? Ray asked me to come over and look at your security system. Go upstairs. Why? You heard me. Go. What's going on? Don't know what you mean. Ray was a lunatic last night. Mickey showed up all beaten. Sean Walker's dead. Something's going on. Ray won't tell me. Abby, I swear, it's just a routine upgrade of your security system. It's part of my job. You're a f*cking liar just like my husband. Get the f*ck out of my house. I'm just gonna look at your alarm panel. Ten minutes, okay? (sighs) You want some coffee? Absolutely. You have cream? (Ray muttering) We got trouble. It's Bunchy. It's bad, Ray. Bunchy : Don't be mad, Ray. What'd you do? It was an accident. Tell me, what did you do? Terry : Come on, Ray. What the f*ck? I need help. Bunchy shot him. I-I didn't mean to. Frances : I managed to stop the bleeding for now, but he needs to get to a hospital. (panting): Yes, yes, a hospital. Please. (rapid panting) You have to help me, okay? I will. Okay. Just lay back. (sobs) I'm sorry, Ray. All right. I didn't mean to, it just happened. Take it easy, Bunch, please. What's the nurse doing here? She showed up after the fights. She stayed over. Get rid of her. It's all right. I trust her. I don't give a f*ck if you trust her, Ter. She's not family. We got to deal with this. Now. Bunchy : Ray? It's Father Danny. You recognize him. Bunch... He's doing it again. To another kid. The same thing he did to me. I... I had to stop him. I had to. I know, I know. Priest : Don't go! Don't leave me! Frances : It looks like the bullet wound went out his back. Must've missed his major organs or he'd be dead by now. I-I stuffed the entrance and exit wounds with bandages. But he needs attention before he goes into shock. So, who's gonna call the ambulance? Do you want me to? Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It was an accident, all right? We just got to sort some things out before we can let him go. Priest : Help me! He may die. Do you care about that? Of course we do. What kind of people do you think we are? I care. Please, Frances. Trust me. We got to do this our way. Make sure Bunchy doesn't get into serious trouble. Why would he get into trouble if it was an accident? It-It's complicated. We'll take care of it. Trust me. All right. All right. You're a good man, Terry. I know you'll do the right thing. You got the gun? Yeah. Where'd you get it? The apartment. Must be Mickey's. Ray? Am I going to jail? No f*cking way are you going to jail. You hear me? I promise. How do you know Walker? Mickey : Met in Boston. Years ago. You know his movie  Black Mass? Yeah. I was a consultant on it. Here's your milk. This is right before you did time for murder? I did time. That part's right. So, you get out of prison, come to L.A., and what? You call Sean Walker? And just like that, he gives you a deal to write a movie? Actually, we were planning to work on more than one. Sounds like you hit the jackpot. I'm the real thing. Sean liked that. What happened to your head? Oh. Had a few drinks last night. Walked right into that f*cking door. (laughing) (smacks lips) Tell me what happened. Priest : Do you hear me? Hey! I was waiting outside his house. I'm hurt! He got in his car. I jumped in. I just wanted to talk. Tell him how it affected me. But he got all excited. Started yelling and everything. And the... Priest : Please! The gun went off. What time was it? What is this, Ray? A cross-examination? It's me or the cops, Terry. What do you want? What time was it? 5:00? 5:30 How'd you get there? How? Come on, Bunch. I-I rode my bike. Where is it? Where? Ray : Where's the f*cking bike?! It's there. On the sidewalk. In front of the house. Oh, f*ck. Priest : Hey! I'm hurt! I need help. He sounds like he's in a lot of pain. Who gives a f*ck? Lena? Hey, boss, I talked to the manager. Sully had two guys with him. And one of them weighed, like, 300 pounds. Yeah, that's Tiny. Does he have a real name? I can check the airline manifests. Drop that. Something's come up. I need you to go to a priest's house in Hollywood on Wilcox Street. It's next to a Catholic Church. You're looking for a bike. What kind of bike is it? Terry : One of those short bikes that kids ride. Bunchy : It's not! I'm not a kid and I ride it! Pop rode it, right? Is he a kid? It's not a f*cking kid's bike. All right. It's a Raleigh Chopper with ape hanger handlebars. Did you hear that? Yeah, I got it. Check out the neighborhood. See if anyone saw anything. Heard a shot around 5:00 a.m. Anything weird. Lena? It's Bunchy. It's serious, all right? Okay. Copy that. Priest : For God's sake, help me! Please! You need to shut up, Father! m*therf*cker. Somebody, you got to get me to a hospital. Shut the f*ck up! Holy Mother of God. This has been some terrible mistake. You think I don't recognize you, O'Connor? St. Josephine, South Boston. No, no, I never served in Boston. I'm from Philly. You're from Philly, huh? I don't know you. I don't know your brother. You don't know my brother? No, I don't. How do you know he's my brother? When he brought me here, he said, "I have to call my brother." Terry! Get in here. (grunts) Hold out your hands. Do it. Hold up your f*cking hands. Which one did you break when this fucker tried to rape you? The right one. I have arthritis. I need medical attention. I don't want to get anyone into trouble, but you-you... you have to help me. I don't have to do anything. (groans) Like the view? It's beautiful. What's that got to do with our security system? I live in town. Don't get much fresh air. You want some eggs? Sure. How do you like them? Mom only does them scrambled and burnt. Shut up, Bridg. I don't like to cook. It's not my thing. Well, let me do it. Seriously? Sure. Do you have onion? Some lox? Smoked salmon? Perfect. Jamey says Sean Walker was tortured before they killed him. Broke both his arms and legs. I hate his movies. He's like the old version of Tommy Wheeler. (laughs) Not. Mom? Is Dad helping the police find the people that killed Sean Walker? Ask Avi. He knows a lot more about your father's business than I do. Where's the salt? I hope you solve this thing. I f*cking loved Sean Walker. He was true blue. A saint. He had a big charity over in Africa. For general mutilation. Oh, by the way, where were you last night? My son owns a boxing gym. We had Fite Nite, amateur bouts. Ended with a bang. My boy clocked a monster. The same son? Another one. The black one. You were at the fights all night? Maybe I stepped out for an hour or so. I suppose you can account for that time? Sure. I was with a lady. That's convenient. Fun, too. And what's her name? How can we contact her? Uh... (clears throat) it's a little tricky, fellas. You see, she's married. So I have to finesse the situation. We need to hear from her by the end of the day. Or we're bringing you in. I don't know if I can contact her today. I'll try my best. Today. Hmm. (cell phone ringing) Mickey? It's good to hear your voice. You, too. How are you? Uh, not so good today. Got myself in a little jam. To tell you the truth, I could use some help. I can't discuss it over the phone. Do you think we could get together? I don't know-- I have a tennis lesson. I don't want to alarm you, but it's a matter of life and death. Okay, I can be there in two hours. I can't tell you how much this means to me. He got all quiet. What are we gonna do? Wait for Lena. How long? As long as it takes. We got to make sure there are no witnesses. But if we wait too long... What if he dies, Ray? (pounding on door) (groans) What the hell? O'connor : Please help me! Terry : All right, all right! The f*ck's up, Terrance? It's all right, Pie. Take the day off. What are you talking about? We had 200 people here last night. Place is trashed. I'll do it. You use too much Clorox. No one can breathe when you do it. Take the day off. We got it covered. This is my gym. I've been cleaning it for 20 years. Before he owned it. What's going on, Terrance? Please, Pie. Do me a favor. Take the day off. Fine. The two of you can live with the stink. (men yelling upstairs) O'connor : Help! Bunchy : Get over here! Get... O'connor : Just let me go. I won't... Bunchy : Father, you can't go. O'connor : Let me go! I won't tell, I swear! I swear! What the f*ck are you doing? I told you to stay away from him. He tried to get out. Have some mercy, I beg you. I'll die back there! Oh, for God's sake, please! Daryll : What the f*ck? Oh, Jesus! I thought you locked the door. I did. He's got his own key, came 'round the back. He's cold. He's going into shock. You got to raise his legs above his head. Stay out of it! O'connor : Don't take me back there, please. Please. Can we at least put him on the couch? Anyone else with a key you want to tell me about? No. All right, let's pick him up. You do it. Okay. Daryll : Oh, watch out, watch out, watch out. On three. One, two... No! (cries out, gasps) He'll die if he goes into shock. Ray : Good. I'll get a blanket. We got to get him to a hospital. Not till we hear from Lena. So you're a Donovan, huh? Mick's boy? Same as you. All right. Go clean up the mess in that locker room. (O'Connor grunts) You seeing anyone, Avi? Not now. Ray keeps me busy. I told you about that texting at the table. God. Busy doing what? Uh... (phone chimes) 
 
 Avi : I have to take care of my mother on the weekends. What's wrong with her? Nothing. Uh, from Friday to Saturday, she can't do anything, like, um... turn on lights, um... cook. Why? Avi : Shabbat. Conor : What? It's the Sabbath, Conor. Like... Black Sabbath? That's a band, you idiot. My mother is Orthodox. She keeps kosher. She can't do anything on the Sabbath because it's the holy day. A day of rest. See, why don't we do that? We're not Jewish. Bridget : We're not anything. We don't have any beliefs. Daddy hates religion. I do yoga. That's not a religion. I'm going to be a Buddhist. Mmm. Um, Lacy asked me to come over to study for our chem final, so... Call me if you need a ride home. I don't think you should go. Mom? She's going to a friend's. She needs to stay in the house. All of you need to stay. Kids, go upstairs. What? Why? Again? Just go. What the hell's going on? Are we in danger? I can't talk about it, Abby. But no one leaves the house until I hear from Ray. You think you can keep me a prisoner in my own house? f*ck you. (phone line ringing) Abby : What the hell's going on? Don't get excited. Avi says we can't leave the house. I just wanted Avi to be there with you. In case. In case  what? Because of Sean. The press. Why would the press want to talk to me about Sean Walker? You expect me to believe that? Look, Abs, just stay there with Avi, okay? Where are you? I'm... Ray? Bunchy : He really doesn't look good. Is that Bunchy? Terry : Hey, Bunch, you want to get me some water? That's Terry. Are you at the gym? No. I... You're a f*cking liar. (exhales) I'm going into town. You take care of the kids. I can't let you do that. Get the f*ck out of my way! Are you gonna lay your hands on me? Go ahead. I f*cking dare you. Conor? Bridg? I'm going into town. Avi's in charge. (door slams) Terry : He needs a doctor, Raymond. If he dies, it's a mortal sin and we all go to Hell. You still believe that crap? After what he did to our family? I know killing's wrong, that's all. We take him to a hospital, he turns Bunch in for shooting him. Maybe he won't. Oh, he will. And then Bunchy goes to prison. How long you think he'll survive in there? Well, I can handle myself in prison. We could say I shot him. What are you talking about? You've done enough for this family. Now it's my turn. (exhales) Come on, Ter. No one's going to prison. Here, Father. Thank you, my son. Your brother's gonna kill me. No. He will if you don't stop him. My death will be a black mark on your soul. It'll keep you out of Heaven. I can't do anything about that. Call the police. I can't. You seem like a good man. Why are you doing this? I'm an alcoholic. I'm sorry. And a sexual anorexic. I have nothing. My life is f*cked. I just wanted an apology. I didn't mean to shoot you. I... (groans) I can help you. You need therapy. It doesn't help. A 12-step program. I could take you to a meeting. I'll get you the help you need. I know some good counselors. Please. Before he comes back. Take me out of here. You told me it was God in my mouth. You said... God was the Host. And when we take communion, we put God in our mouth. When you asked me to suck your dick, you said it was the same thing. You said I was putting God in my mouth. No, that's... that's not... I d... I didn't... You can't just say you're sorry? Please. I wish I could. I know it would ease your pain. But I don't know you. Arms down. Raise your right leg. Sir, turn and face me. Well, he definitely has a problem. I know. Sir... (sighs heavily) He missed a task force meeting yesterday. Where'd u get this file? A cop friend of mine pulled him over. He didn't arrest him... didn't want to embarrass the agency. I mean, you can imagine how that would've played out on the evening news: "FBI Agent Out of His Mind on LSD." People still do LSD? Well, apparently Van does. Nice and straight... (sighs) Left leg at a 45-degree angle. sh1t. Straight. Hang on. Sir... I hate this. A f*cking career down the drain. Bring him in. All right. Hey, Frank. Touch your toes, sir. Some agents-- they would have sat on this file and give Van a second chance. You don't have a grudge against him, do you? No, sir. I just don't like seeing a fellow agent f*cking up like this. It makes us all look bad. (phone chimes) Lena's downstairs. I didn't find the bike. I'm guessing it was stolen. Witnesses? Nobody heard anything unusual. One old lady did say she heard a gunshot some time before dawn, but she says that happens all the time. Okay. O'connor : Please! Help me! I'm hurt! Is there anything else I can do? Take this back to the office for me. Okay. Please! Help me! And Lena... Yeah? Thanks. You got it. He's getting bad, Ray. There were no witnesses. The bike's gone. So what does that mean? It means O'Connor could disappear and no one's gonna connect it to Bunchy. We have to help him. I promised Frances. This is family, Ter, and I don't give a sh1t about your promises. Who put you in charge? You got a better idea? Sit up. Wha... what? Easy... (yelling) Listen to me. (breathing hard) No more lies. Tell him you're sorry for what you did to him. I didn't do anything. Just f*cking say it. (yells, sobs) Tell him you're sorry... and you live. Keep up the bullshit, you're dead. Stop him. Don't talk to them! Don't do... You're good men. Don't let him do this. Shut up. Shut up. Don't let him do this... Shut the f*ck up! Daryll : Ray, chill! Just tell him you're sorry! Chill, Ray! Tell him you're f*cking sorry! Chill! Get off of me! Get in there. f*ck off. Terry : You got to cool down, Ray. We got to think this through. This is all my fault. Oh, Christ, Bunch. Get back out there and keep an eye on him. All right. It happened to me. Not you, not you. Just me. So there must be something in me, something he saw. 'Cause he was nice to me a lot of the time. Took me places. You know, we went camping. I never fished before. It's peaceful. We went to games... Maybe I just wanted those things and that's why I let him f*ck around with me. It was my fault. What are you talking about? How could it be your fault, Ray? Bucky f*ckin' Dent. What? Bucky f*ckin' Dent. You remember that? The tiebreaker? You kidding me? Everyone in Boston remembers that. Mickey promised to take me. He was living with Claudette, but he said he got tickets. I waited for him. I don't know how long. I walked around the park over and over. Thought he'd be standing at one of those entrances, and... I could hear the game. I don't know how many times I circled that park before I realized he wasn't coming. He forgot, or he never had the tickets in the first place. Just another f*cking lie. When I got home, O'Connor was leaving. I found you in your room. I knew just by looking at you. I knew what he'd done to you. I wasn't there. I didn't protect you. It's not your fault, Ray. You didn't know what he was. He had us all fooled. I want him to apologize. Then I want to help him. (video game gunfire) Oh, dude, you rock. You got to have quick hand-eye coordination to get into the Mossad. What's that? It's covert operations in Israel. Like Special Ops? Exactly. I was 16 when I went into the army. I had to lie about my age. Anything to get off the kibbutz. What's "kibutts"? Kibbutz. My parents split up, and I went with my father to the kibbutz. And I hated it. You had to get special permission just to kiss a girl. Really? Well, not really. But almost. So I went in the army. It was worse. But then I started the Mossad training. I got to work alone. They called me the Lone Wolf. Wow. I want to move to Israel. Yeah? Is a Jew the same as a Yid? Ray : Get up. What do you want from me? You're going to apologize to my brother. I told you. I don't know him. You're gonna do what needs to be done. You understand? You're gonna tell him you're sorry. (grunts) Look at him. (sighs) Tell him who you are. I'm Father O'Connor from St. Josephine's. Father Danny. That's what the kids used to call me. I was close to your mother. When she got sick, it was heartbreaking. All she had to go through. You children, losing her so young. Your father not around. I cared for you. I cared for all of you. Tell him what else you did. I had a problem. I... I did things that were inappropriate. Is that what you call it? O'connor : It's an addiction. I love children. But... they can be seductive. They don't mean to be, but... they're so free and pure. So you rape 'em? No. Never. I'm not a violent person. No, you just like f*cking little kids. I've been punished. I was in treatment for two years. They make you take drugs. Chemical castration. It kills the compulsion. I don't hurt children anymore. What about that boy I saw you with? Miguel? Oh, I'm tutoring him. No, you're hurting him. No, I'm not, I swear. I didn't hear an apology. (sighs) I said... if I did anything... No "if"! No f*cking "if"! We're all sinners, Ray. We've all fallen short in the eyes of God. Who hasn't hurt someone? Caused pain? And we seek forgiveness. And we find it. Do you forgive me? (pounding at door) (Terry sighs) Who's that? Abby. What's going on? You have to go. Why is Avi at our house? To protect you. From what? I can't talk about it now, Abs. Please. O'connor : Please help me. I'm hurt. Please... Oh, my God. Abs, wait. Abs... O'connor : Please... don't. (crying): Please... (gasps) Hi, Abby. Help me. I'll wait for you at home. O'connor : Don't go. Don't go! Please... I'm hurt! Don't leave me! Please! Daryll... go lock the door. I can't believe that you drove up here just for me. You'd do the same for me. You bet. Besides, I like the drive. A few hours all to myself. Allen gets on your nerves, huh? (laughs) Relationships are... tough. Don't I know it? Fresh up your drink. No. Better not. Come on. You used to be a party girl. I was a good, churchgoing girl before I met you. We had fun. (laughs) Remember this? Does Allen dance with you? Allen's not the dancing type. Too bad. You want to... give it a go for old time's sake? Mick, you don't have to go through all of this. If you need something, just ask. Yeah, o-okay. I need you to say that you were with me last night. I understand, it might not be possible. Maybe you were out, maybe... I know your, your life with Allen... But if it is possible... (exhales) Like I said... uh, I'm in a jam. Allen was out of town last night. I was home alone. So... if I were to say that I drove into town to see you... who's to say I didn't? You would do that for me? After all you've done for me? The money... Getting me out of Boston when I was in trouble... Mick... I owe you. (gulping) (chokes, gasps) We got to take him to a hospital now. (coughs) I can't wait anymore. Please, Ray. If he dies... I got enough guilt. I won't tell anyone what happened, I promise. Bunchy : See? He's a liar. O'connor : I'm not lying. I caused your family enough pain. Ray. Please. We got to. All right. But I take him. Alone. I go with you. No. You stay here, clean up, look after Bunch. That's the way it's gonna be, Ter, or it's not gonna be at all. All right. Get my car, bring it around back. We'll load him up there. Okay. What's going on? Don't talk, sit up. You're gonna take me to the hospital? That's what my brothers want. You're all taking me? I'm taking you. Here, wrap yourself in that. He's gonna kill me. No, he won't hurt you, Father. Terry : It's all right. O'connor : You don't understand. He won't take me to the hospital. I'll never get there. Yeah, you will. Yeah, you'll be all right. They don't know, do they? Shut up. You never told them. I told you to shut up. Ray, Don't do this to me. Shut the f*ck up. Ray... You... I loved you. (gunshot) God help you, Ray.
