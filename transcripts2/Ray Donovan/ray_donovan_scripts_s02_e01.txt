 Previously on Ray Donovan: 
 Terry : The old man made parole. He wasn't supposed to be out for five more years. He's out, Ray. Ray : You let him near this family, everything we worked for... It'll be over. Deonte : She's dead, Dawg. Ray : You think you're the first person I've dealt with, woke up in bed with a dead body? Lee : Guy has a $200 million heterosexual movie coming out in a month  and picks up a tranny on Sunset Boulevard. Ray : I have a way to get you out of this. Did I kill her? (Grunts) (Grunts) What's going on, Bunchy? Since he's been back here, he's been putting sh1t in your head. I'm a sexual anorexic. You're kidding me. Great guns you got there. Terry : You're cheating on him. You can't go from his bed into mine. I'm in love with you. It's over between us. Terry : You remember Dad's girlfriend, Claudette? They had a kid. His name's Daryll. Do me proud. (Grunting) Ray : You a Donovan or not? Hell yeah, I'm a Donovan. Then get used to that prick letting you down. I stole half a million for you. Ray said you'd stolen a lot of money from Sully. You'd be dead if it weren't for us. What did you say to him? I don't remember. You have to remember. I can't. I have a brain tumor. Van : I'm the guy that got you out of prison. Mickey : What do you want from me? Van :  I want them all… and your boy, Ray. (Gunshot) He f*cking murdered an FBI agent. We're gonna have to kill him. Who hates him more than we do? Raymond. Sully. I want you to kill my father. (Laughs) I'm not leaving here until you f*ck me. Get over to my apartment right away. I got a girl handcuffed to my towel rack. (Grunts) Abby : Your son's getting in fights. What's your name? Marvin Gaye Washington. I want to have s*x. I'm surprised I could f*ck you. You're really not my type. Kneel down, honey. (Crying) This is gonna be over fast. (Crying) I'll buy you anything you want. What I want, you can't give me. Try me. Emotional honesty. Ah, geez. Get the f*ck off the boat. I'm f*cking FBI. And I'm FBI's most wanted. So, go f*ck yourself. Bunchy :  Father Danny… He's here in L.A. I seen him. Is that the one that abused Bunchy? Wasn't only Bunch. I told you what happened with that man. You called me a liar, and you beat the sh1t out of me. You've been dead to me since I was ten years old. It was an accident. I need help. Bunchy shot him. They don't know, do they? I told you to shut up. I loved you. (Gunshot) ♪ (Shovel scrapes) (Grunts) (Panting) (Grunts) (Grunts) (Panting) (Grunting) (Both moaning, panting) (Grunts) (Exhales) (Shuddering) (Panting) (Sighs) (Sniffs) (Sighs) (Inhales) I'm going for a swim. Mickey... Come back to bed. We drank too much. Don't worry about it. ♪ (Laughs, spits) Female voice : Hola, Mickey. Welcome to México. (Laughs) Beautiful water, beautiful sun, beautiful women. (Sighs) Come, Mickey. Swim with me. I'm getting tired. Oh, no, Mickey. You're not a sailor. You're a captain. I'm a captain? Come... Deeper. Deeper, Mickey. Mickey. Mickey. I'm in a very dark place, Mickey. And you put me here. It wasn't me! It was Sully. I'm so lonely. Hey, Bridget, check it out. He just got eight million hits. He didn't just get them. That's the total. Why are you being such an asshole? Who cares when he got them? He's famous, and he was your boyfriend. He wasn't my boyfriend. Then what was he? You were making out with him all the time. I was not! Look, just turn it off. I don't want to hear it, okay? (Phone beeps) What are you doing? (Chuckling): Hey, Marvin, it's C-money. Give me my phone. Male reporter (over TV) : Is about to begin, to discuss the details... What are you two fighting about? Bridget's being a f*cking douche bag. Hey. Bridget : Cut it out. Thanks, Bill. I'm outside the federal building in Westwood, where later today a press conference will be held to reveal the long-awaited details... Your dad and I have something to do. Of the shooting of America's most wanted. Patrick "Sully" Sullivan was shockingly found right here in Los Angeles just two weeks ago. Sullivan was allegedly... Abby : Don't miss the bus. I'm gonna drive the kids to school. I'll meet you there. (Music shuts off) Are you gonna have time? (Keys jingle) I'll be there. I promise. Come on, let's go. Really? Shh. (Marvin's hip-hop song plays) You're doing great. Stop riding the brake. ♪ Now I'm out here on my own ♪ (sighs) ♪ I just want to come home... ♪ Where are you and mom going that's so secret? Therapy. Eyes on the road, please. Sorry. Why? They're having problems. We were staying in a hotel, remember? We're doing fine. Just... drive the car right now, okay? Let's not talk about me and mom. Conor (rapping over song) : ♪ Never knew my daddy ♪ 
♪ so my memory's kind of filthy ♪ 
♪ slippin' on the darkness ♪ 
♪ all these niggas want to kill me. ♪ Conor? What? Shut up. Abby : It was a very bad year. His father came out of prison... And made Ray crazy. And they fought all year. But he's gone now, right, Ray? He's gone. If we're going to make any progress here, I think it's important for both of you to own your own side of the street. Okay? Who wants to go first? Well, Mickey was here because I brought him here. I let him in. I wrote to him in prison without Ray knowing about it. That was a terrible thing to do. And then I let him see the kids. Thank you for your honesty, Abby. Ray? Yeah? I think we need to talk about your violence, Ray. Your children saw you hit grandpa with a gun. He's "grandpa" now? Sorry they saw that. They saw you manhandle Bridget's young friend. They saw you passed out on a beach, covered in blood. They didn't know what happened to you. They thought daddy was dead. Can you imagine how that felt? (Sighs) Yes. Yes. I can. Man : Can we make a contract here, Ray? How about no more violence in front of the kids? No more blood? Can we agree to that? Sure. Sounds reasonable. I love my family, you know? So... (Quiet laugh) (Phone buzzing) (Sighs) I'm sorry, I... I got to go. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. (Ray clears throat) (Sighs) All right. That... That went fairly well. (Quiet laugh) It did. And how are things with you? Good. Really good. (Sighs, laughs) It's not all bad. So, you're still having s*x two times a day? Why are you so obsessed with that? I know women who would love to be f*cked by their husbands two times a day. Abby... Is it possible his-his... Hypersexual behavior is a symptom of his abuse? Is it possible he just likes to f*ck? Until he can face his molestation, I'm afraid your marriage is going to be in trouble. I should never have told you about that. (Sighs) (Footsteps depart) (Door opens) (Sighs) (Phone rings) (Phone chimes) Yeah. Frank (Over speakerphone) : Ray. We're f*cked. The director's back. He's not buying the story. What'd you do, Frank? (Sighs) Ray, calm down. What'd you f*cking do? I'm coming there. (Phone chimes) Ray... ? (Sighs) Ballistics came back. What are you talking about? The f*cking ballistics, Ray. So how'd you f*ck it up, Frank? They pulled the bullet from Avi's chest, and it matched Sully's gun. They know he was there, and they know he works for you. What was I supposed to do, Ray, huh? He knew I was f*cking lying! (Under breath): Piece of sh1t. Ray, give me a f*cking minute, will you?! Ray. Ray. This isn't Volcheck we're dealing with. Cochran's the next in line to take over the bureau. f*ck, Ray, don't do this. How are we supposed to keep our stories straight? We're not. Excuse me. Can I help you? I'm Ray Donovan. Yeah, oh, I know who you are. You're a bag man for movie stars. You're also an extortionist and a wiretapper... Well, basically, you're an all-around piece of sh1t. So, why am I standing here? Because you were on that dock that night, and I would really like to know why. (Clears throat) Okay, look... Uh... I have a press conference today. I was all set to give the medal of valor to Agent Volcheck... And this f*cking idiot, when I got this ballistics report back. Now, would you like to tell me what really happened? You don't want to know what really happened. Your father is Mickey Donovan, right? So what? Why was he there that night? You don't want to know. Oh, I've had enough of this sh1t. I'm putting you away, pal. I brought Sully out here to kill my father. Paid him $2 million to do it. Jesus f*cking Christ, Ray. Will you shut the f*ck up? (Hangs up phone) Wow. (Laughs) That didn't work out so well, now, did it? (Laughs) No. Either of you two guys want to tell me who the f*ck shot Sully? My father. Uh, okay, so actually... Get the f*ck out of my sight. All right, I need your father in this office right away. What for? I'm not gonna take your word for all this sh1t, now, am I? Listen to me. Do yourself a favor... Have your press conference, tell your story... Enjoy your moment. America's most wanted is dead. You're a hero. God bless America. Ray. You don't know where he is, do you? f*ck you. (Door shuts) Faster taps. Speed is power. Flip it. Flip it. All right, on the balls of your feet. Right there. Right there. Beautiful. Terrance, what the f*ck? What's on your mind? (Hip-hop music playing) Nothing. (Panting): Take over. Oh, sh1t! Pat Riley up in this m*therf*cker. I look okay? You look clean, yeah. You got any long pants? No. Don't worry about it. You look good. All right, hands up. Hands up, on your toes. Come on. (Line ringing) Frances : Hello? Hello? (Hangs up phone) Where's Mick? He's in Mexico. But I don't know where. I need to find him, Terry. Ray... come on. Leave it alone. No. I can't. It's for business. It's not business. It's just you. Hey. Hey, Bunch. Do I look okay? I don't have any long pants! You look fine, Bunch. You know where Mick is? No. He left town. What do you care? Where's Daryll? (Phone ringing) What up? It's Ray. Where's Mick? Oh, so now you call me? I need to find him, Daryll. You're the magnum P.I., m*therf*cker. (Laughs) You find him. sh1t. (Phone ringing) Yeah? Yo, I f*cked up, Dawg. (Women shouting) I f*cked up big. You have to get over here asap. Marvin : ♪ Slippin' into darkness, yo, these niggas wanna kill me... ♪ It's my sister's boyfriend. He hangs out at my house all the time. I love this song. He's full of sh1t. He's always saying he knows all these f*cking famous people. Tommy Wheeler... Marvin Gaye Washington. (Phone clatters on ground) Oh... (Grunts) Boy : Oh, dude... ! You all right? (Groaning) Girl : You all right? Woman (shouting) : I cannot believe this. I cannot believe... this! I leave my house for 24 hours. Girl (crying) : I'm sorry! Woman : And I come back to find you and my husband in my bed. What is wrong with you?! How old are you? (Girl crying, gasping) Girl : It doesn't matter, okay?! (Indistinct arguing) It ain't snow, Dawg. It ain't snow, so she came home early. It's that global warming; big bear, they have no snow. She's home. (Women shouting) Who's the girl? I-I was at American Idol last night. She's top three. What's her name? Bitch can sing! She-she gonna win. You don't know her name, do you? Girl : Let me explain! Woman : I am going to kick your ass! And after I kick your ass, I'm kicking his ass. You got guns in there? Hell, no. They locked up downstairs, like you told me. I got kids in here, man. (Gunshot) (Girl screaming, crying) Oh, sh1t! (Girl crying) (Gasping): Oh, my God. I'm sick and tired of this m*therf*cker, Ray. Yeah, I know you are. (Panting) (Sighs) He's a piece of sh1t. (Crying): Yes. You should shoot him. Huh? What? Go ahead. (Crying) (Crying) Keep pressure on that. Oh, my God, I'm dying. I was supposed to perform tonight. Now I'm gonna die at number three. (Sniffles) (Shuddering) My insurance card is in the inside pocket. (Panting) What are you doing?! Are you crazy?! (Phone ringing) Keep your mouth shut, you hear me? (Phone beeps) Yeah. Amato (over phone) : Mr. Donovan, it's Principal Amato. There's been an incident here at the school involving your son, Conor. Your wife is on her way. (Panting) Is he all right? He's fine, but he is in serious trouble. You need to come in here right away. (Screams, grunts) (Tires screeching, engine revving) I'll be there as soon as I can. (Panting) (Crying) Shut up. (Tires screech) (Gasps) (Gun cocks) (Panting) Get out of the car. You want to go onstage tonight and have a chance to win? Or do you want to be the girl that got f*cked by Deonte Brown and shot by his wife? Huh? (Crying) (Mutters): I gotta go. (Car door closes) (Panting) All right, wait here. No, I want to go to Cedar's right now. Do what I tell you, you'll be there in a few minutes. (Screaming) (Gasps) Listen to me. (Whining): No! You were mugged, you understand? Big guy with a hoodie, you didn't see his face, all right? No, please don't leave me. Hey, how you doing? How do you think I'm doing? I'm f*cking dying! Calm down, take a deep breath. (Gasping) Okay? (Phone clicks) Yeah, hi. I'd like to report a mugging. A girl's just been shot, and she's bleeding, so please hurry. Uh, it's at the park (Grunts) at North Beverly and Sunset. (Crying) (Car engine starts) Thank you. You're a good singer. I've seen you perform. You watch the show? Oh, yeah, I love it. And I think you got a real shot, too. But if you don't follow the story I'm about to tell you... We're gonna shoot you again. (Reggaeton music playing) Gracias. I was born in Veracruz. Near Coatzacoalcos. Do you know where that is? I was raised by Catholics. By the time I was ten, though, they figured out that I had dyslexia. Ay, como chingas. It was so crazy. (Laughing): Hey, boy! Hey, yo! My... my boy. (Laughing) Good to see you, pop. You look good. Yeah. You ready? Hell, yeah. Come on, pop, I stay ready. So, how big is this guy? Is he big? He's a Mexican. How big could he be? (Both laughing) Don't worry about it. 
 
 Here, have a seat. Hola. Hi. Sit. Eat. We got fresh red snapper. What's your name again, sweetheart? Como chingas, Mickey. How many times I got to tell you? Jazmin. Mickey : This is Daryll. Whoo. My son. Wow. This looks great. So, I'll see you and I'll see you. Here you go. Man : Mickey... I was just looking for you, man. Oh, yeah? What for? Too late. I want the room another month. How much do I owe you? Uh, $300 for the room and $100 for the puta. Don't insult the lady. I'll knock your f*cking teeth out. You know how much an ass like that would cost in L.A.? Boop. You'll help me out, kid? (Sighs) Um... Yeah, I mean, uh... I'll see how much I got. This is... Let's see. There we go. There. I'll give you the rest after the fight tonight. (Speaks Spanish) (Grumbles) How are the boys? You know, they're all right. They miss me? You seen Ray? Mm-mm. Are you the fighter? Yes, I am. You gonna come tonight? Oh, you want my autograph? Yes. El Negro? What kind of sh1t is this? Pop, they're calling me negro down here. It's El Negro. It's Mexican. It's... It's different. Nah, it's fucked-up. You're fine. No, it's fucked-up. What's your name, little man? My name is Noe. Noe? Well, I'm Daryll Donovan. Black Irish. Here you go, homie. Thank you. You're welcome. Here. Have a drink. Relax. Relax? Pop, I'm about to have a fight in a couple hours, and you're offering me a f*cking drink? Good point. (Laughs) (Chuckles) I made my dad leave my apartment. Living on my own again. Like a grown-up. It ain't all roses and rainbows. Sometimes I get lonely. The good part is I'm not around his p0rn no more. (Short chuckle) No. No more booze. No more coke. No more hookers. I... I got a job interview at a bike shop today. You'd be good at that, Bunchy. You look good, Bunch. I like the tie. Thanks. Thanks, guys. (Quiet applause) (Exhales) Ray : You trace the call? Avi (over phone) : Yeah. My guy from AT&T says that Daryll was driving past a cell phone tower in Baja. Heading south. All right. Stay on it. I will. Av... Yeah? You feeling okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm healing nicely. Thanks. We'll put it on your account, Ray. Thanks, doll. Hi. I'm Stan. Bunchy. That's a great tie. Thanks. I'm new to all this. I wish I could put my abuse behind me the way that you have. Yeah? I didn't put it behind me so much as I buried it. I really connected with you. Do you want to maybe... Grab a bite to eat? Talk about it? Aw... nah, I... Got to get to my job interview. Oh, y... (Laughs) Um... Well, uh, maybe another time. Yeah. Maybe. Okay. Hey, good luck. I really like bikes. Anything on two wheels, I can fix. Handlebars, gears, you know, doesn't matter. I can fix anything in this store. Brendan, there's a blank here. Who's your previous employer? Uh... Uh, The Boston Globe. Oh, really? That's impressive. What did you do there? I delivered it. (Quiet chuckle) Amato : There were words exchanged. The other boy knocked Conor's cell phone out of his hands. Conor retaliated by pushing the boy down a flight of stairs. So the other kid started it? He has a broken collar bone, Ray. We have a zero-tolerance policy for violence here at Calabasas High School. This is a very serious situation. We have to be prepared now for a potential lawsuit or even a criminal investigation. Five days, Con? What am I supposed to do? Stay home and babysit? I have a life, too. (Sighs) Come here. We'll take care of this. All right? We're gonna call the kid's parents. Go over to their house and we'll apologize. For what? He threw my phone on the ground and broke it. You pushed him down the stairs. We can get sued. Really? Yeah, really. It's all right. We'll sort it out tonight. Get in the car. Sweetheart. Thank you. For what? For coming here to deal with this. I know you're busy. Nothing's more important. I'll see you later. (Phone rings) I need you, Raymond. (Applause, whistling) (Speaking Spanish) ¡Damas y caballeros! (Speaking Spanish) desde Hollywood, California, Daryll "El Negro" Donovan! (Booing, applause) The crowd is gonna be against you on this one. You got to use that sh1t to fuel your fire. Yeah. Make 'em remember El Negro. Huh? Okay, yeah. All right, breathe. (Emcee speaking Spanish) Miguel "La Fuerza" Montago! (Cheering, applause) (Trumpets play a tune) You kidding me, Mickey? That guy's f*cking huge. All right, he's a little bit bigger than I thought. But who the f*ck trained you? Keep dancing, keep moving. Stick him when you can. You can take this cocksucker. Look at me. You can take him. (Referee speaking Spanish) (Referee speaking Spanish) (Applause, whistling) (Spits) Mind over matter. (Referee speaking Spanish) Use your feet. Keep your distance. (Bell dings) (Grunts) (Indistinct shouting) Get away from him. (Speaking Spanish) Stick and move. Uno, dos, tres, Referee and crowd : Cuatro, cinco, seis,  siete, ocho, nueve, diez. (Bell dings, cheering) (Exclaims) I want to talk to you about Ray Donovan. He works for you, right? I hire his company from time to time. What kind of, uh, business do you hire him for? Well, he's also a client, which means I can't discuss anything about him. Right. I see. Is, uh, Mickey Donovan also a client? Why are you asking me questions about Mickey Donovan? I don't know anything about him. So I guess, uh, you couldn't tell me where he is, then? No. Is there an investigation I should know about? Not at this time. I don't know. I just... Wanted this to be an informal chat. Oh, look. Here's your boy now. He's not my boy. How dare you. You need to find your father. You got, uh... 24 hours. Mr. Goldman. Pleasure chatting with you. What'd you tell him? I didn't tell him anything. But where were you? Why is he looking for Mickey? I thought all that was over. What does he want? Relax, Ezra. I can't relax. Don't you know what's at stake? Tikkun olam. What? Tikkun olam. I don't know what that means, Ezra. "To repair the world." We must repair the world, Raymond. Right. The Ruth Goldman cancer center is the most important thing in my life. Yeah, I know. While I was ill last year, a lot of people took advantage. They stopped digging at the site, Raymond. We're at least $50 million short. You're gonna have to help me make good on these pledges. It's gonna be the toughest thing we've ever had to do. I need your help. I know you do. I can't spend the rest of my life in prison. Do you have it all under control, Raymond? Yeah. Yeah. I love Sylvia Plath. Sylvia Plath was a freak. She should have been on Lexapro. She had no one. I mean, her husband fell in love with someone else. And she wrote all the poems in Ariel,  and it was so cold that winter. She should've moved. She couldn't. You know, she had two little kids. She was so brave. You're a freak, Bridg. (Laughs) (Siren chirps) sh1t. (Indistinct police radio chatter) Do you know why I pulled you over? No. You just made a right turn without putting on your blinker. Oh, my God, I did? What's your name? Bridget Donovan. Is that your backpack? Y-yeah, why? Miss, could you step out of the car, please? Why? What did I do? Just step out of the car, please. Right now. Stand over here, please. Hey. How's the girl? For someone who got shot a couple hours ago, not bad. They buy her story? Yeah. She did great. Thanks, hon. Course. (Phone ringing) Hey. Bridget (crying) : Daddy? Bridg? (Indistinct radio transmission) Bridg... Officer : Hello, Mr. Donovan. This is Officer Jansen. I'm here with your daughter. Pulled over a friend of hers and found an ounce of marijuana in Bridget's backpack. The f*ck you talking about? But she seems like a good kid, so we're gonna let her go this time. Put her back on. (Sniffles) I don't understand, daddy. I... I didn't do it. I don't have any pot. I know you didn't do it. You know how I know? Because you're my girl and I trust you. (Bridget sobbing) Sweetheart... You're gonna be okay, but I need you to go home right now, all right? Okay, daddy. Listen... Can you hold off telling mom for a while? I just want a little time to figure out how to tell her. Can we do that? Yes. Okay. I'll see you at home. You okay? (Sniffles) I'm okay, daddy. (Laughs) Put the officer back on. (Sniffles) Love you. Officer : Yeah? Tell Cochran I got his message. (Phone ringing) Fite club. Where the f*ck's my brother? Which one? ♪ The f*ck you doing here? Hey. What, are you stalking her now? You got to stay away from her, Terry. Hey, you listening to me? Hey, you put a hand on me, I'll lay you out. Come on. I need you to tell me where Mick is. Why? So the both of you can f*ck it all up again? Leave him be. He's better off gone. I'm in trouble, Terry. If I don't find Mickey and bring him back, it's over for me. I need your help. Please. (Festive music playing) (Whooping) Oh-ho! Ah. Blow on 'em. Blow on 'em for luck. Yeah. Ooh... Others : Uno! Dos! Tres! (Electrical crackling) Cuatro! Cinco! (Electrical crackling continues) Seis! Siete! Others : Oh! (Lively chatter) Are you okay? (Man speaking Spanish) Here. (Humming with music) ♪ (Man whistling) (Man speaks Spanish) (People shouting in Spanish) Have another one! Jefe... para todos. Drinks on me. ¿Todos? Para todos. ♪ (Lively chatter continues) So, you bet against me? My heart was with you, kid. My money was against you. When you're ready, I'll bet for you. Ready? Mickey, you put me in there with a f*cking monster. There isn't any getting ready for that. Look at my f*cking face. And that's why... You get half. Here. Take this. I don't want your f*cking money. Hey. Don't get mad. This is only the beginning. Got a good thing going here. What, and end up just like Terry? You think I gave him that disease? Is that what you think? Doctor told me they don't know how he got it. Maybe it's hereditary. Maybe I'm next. Maybe you got it already. Who knows? Daryll. (Phone rings) Yeah? Daryll : He's in Rosarito. I know. Then what do you need me for, then, m*therf*cker? Where in Rosarito? This place called Lucy's. Thanks, Daryll. (Phone rings) Where are you? I'll be back tomorrow. I thought you and Conor were gonna go apologize to that kid tonight. I can't. Something came up. Well, I'm not taking him. Conor's gonna be okay. I'll take him tomorrow, I promise. All right, Ray. Whatever you say. Look, Abs, I'm sorry. I got to go. (Sighs) (Cell phone chimes) (Sighs) A member of our family was brutally attacked this morning. We've received thousands of e-mails  asking : "How is Tiffany?" We have an answer... (Applause, cheering) Right... now. (Intro to Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" playing) ♪ Every night ♪
