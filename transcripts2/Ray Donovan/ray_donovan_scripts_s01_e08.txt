 Bridget :  You never told me how Bridget died. 
 Ray :  She was high on drugs. 
 She jumped off a roof. 
 That's really sad. 
 Aram :  This place is great, a good investment. 
 You got money, right? 
 Lawyer :  This is a check  from the diocese for your settlement of $1.4 million. 
 He didn't tell me he was buying a house. 
 What, he didn't ask your permission? 
 (panting) 
 No! No! No! 
 What the f*ck? 
 Mickey :  What did you do? 
 Let it burn. 
 Sully died ten years ago. 
 Ray :  Just tell him I'm here. 
 I want you to kill my father. I can set you up wherever you want to go. It's not gonna be cheap. Bridget :  Is that your girlfriend? Terry :  Yeah, she is. What's wrong? I'm just happy you're here. Well, good. Don't forget it. Ray :  Sean f*cking Walker? Van :  I have evidence  that he shot a girl in Boston 20 years ago. And then he frames a working Joe from an honest family for the murder. I buy this story, I own it. You cannot share this with anyone. Marvin : She was murdered in our own house. f*ck you, man. You knew. Stay away from him, you understand me? Marvin :  Your dad thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on you. Bridget :  My dad's the bad influence. I'm not ready. Pipe me, bitch. Come on. Do it! Marvin! You asshole! What did he do? He just got carried away. I didn't mean to hurt her. Bridget :  He's gonna kill him. Mom.

You're both ready to go face-to-face, are you? Woman : Yeah, we sure are, Tom. Boy : Yes, sir, we're ready. So, you just gonna leave me here like a piece of sh1t? You got to stay here to take care of my mother. Why should I? Years I've been taking care of her. Now you got to take care of me. 54... I cannot go through another winter in Boston, Patrick. I'm getting arthritis in both my knees. See, I missed it now. f*ck it. I have been living like sh1t for years with you. Like a mole underground. Moles don't get their hair done every freaking week. Now you're gonna be rich, and you're not taking me with you? Well, who takes care of you like I do? (TV audience groans) Who lays out your pills? Who cooks for you? Who rubs Bengay Come on. on your sore shoulder? Who makes you hard? Say it. Who makes you hard, baby? You got to say it. Who makes you hard? Woman : Uh, China. Tom : Right you are. You do. You make me hard. Now, shut up and blow me already. (sighs) (laughs) (zipping) Tom : Which president was in office when Uncle Sam first got... (turns up TV volume) ♪ ♪ (sighing) ♪ ♪ (sighs) (groans) (line ringing) Aram : Hello. That fire this morning? What? That was a warning. You burned my f*cking house? I'll kill you! What the f*ck you want, huh? The house you sold to Brendan Donovan, I want the f*cking money back or I'm gonna set fire to every property you own. f*ck you, asshole. You... (phone beeps) Yeah, Terry, what's up? Hey, you coming? Yeah, I'm coming. You think I forgot? All right, see you soon. See you. Bridget? (sighs) You got to put your sh1t all over the place? (sighs) (sighs) Hi, Mama. You went and got pierced, huh? What? I thought we talked about this. I thought we agreed that I was gonna go with you, and I was gonna pick the place. Now you're gonna get hepatitis. No, I'm not. It never leaves your system. Let me see it. Oh, Jesus. (sighs) You let her do this? In principle, yeah. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means I told her she could do it, but not without me being there, and I was gonna pick the place. If she didn't go with you, who did? I went by myself. When? Yesterday. What time yesterday? I skipped my last two classes, but I'm getting A's in both of them. I can't even think how you're gonna get punished for this. Why don't you beat her? I'm not my f*cking father. The therapist said I could do it, and you agreed, Mom. Therapist? What therapist? She said it's a way for me to reclaim my body after what happened. What therapist? I ok her to see someone. She was sexually abused, Ray. Oh, f*ck. I wasn't sexually abused. Are you f*cking kidding me? You let this go on? I told you I was gonna decide some things. I told you that. Not this. It's a symbolic gesture, Ray. You're her father. It's inappropriate for you to be involved with this. What the f*ck are you talking about? That's exactly why I need to be involved in this. Did you kill Marvin? What? No. What did you do to him? I did what had to be done. What the f*ck does that mean? You don't talk to me like that. Take that out now. We had a deal: no piercings, no tattoos till you're 18. You take that out now, or you're not leaving this house. (dog barking, indistinct talking) Man, I been hanging from a loose noose. Man, that can't be healthy. (phone chirps) Looking for my mind. (sighs) Mrs. Davis? Mm-hmm. Right this way. Thank you. (smacks lips) What are you working on? It's a treatment. What they call a treatment for... for a movie. Oh, yeah? What's it about? My life. That's it? You're gonna tease a girl like that? I optioned my life rights to Sean Walker. Wow. Really? Yeah. Sean and I are... You know? I mentioned that my back hurt. He sent me here today. Treats me like a brother. So tell me what it's about. My life as a criminal. I got sent away for something I did not do. For how long? 20 years. Gee, that's... awful. I write, too. Oh, yeah? I've been hearing a lot of that. Guy who packs up my groceries is working on something. Same with the garbage man. Oh, I really do write. My husband was a big producer, and part of my settlement was a two-script deal. Oh. Good for you. You a Jew? (laughs) Mazel tov. How long she been dead? (sighs) 1987. Do the math. Never my subject, Ray. (chuckling): Oh, yeah? Remind me, Bunch. What was your subject? 26 years. Come on. I can't not toast. It's bad luck with water. "Farewell, my dearest sister. "Fare thee well. "The elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits "all of comfort. Fare thee well." Who was that again? William Shakespeare. Frances : Sorry. Am I interrupting something? It's our sister's birthday. We do this every year. Oh, that's really lovely. It's Bridget, right? Bunchy : Uh-huh. Ray named his kid after her. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. I-I can wait. It's all right. Come on. (door opens) (door closes) So, what? You staying here every night now? Yeah. Why'd you light your house on fire, Bunch? I don't like it. Why'd you pull a gun on Pop? I don't like him. (both laugh) Oh, yeah, that's really gonna help. Go f*ck yourself, Ray. I thought you were gonna get my money back for the house. I'm working on it. Terry : He do that to you? Your husband? How the hell did you know I was married? Did you follow me? You lied to me. And you led me on. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. I don't love him. But I can't leave him until my kid is out of the house. He's 17. I'm not a side man. What does that mean? What does it sound like? What'd you come here for? I don't know. Thanks for the f*cking support. See you. We doing this or not? "May the road rise up to meet you. "May the wind be ever at your back. May..." (slams shot glass) You don't hit women. Oh, come on, Ter, just... Wait a minute, would you...? f*ck. (sniffs) Bridg? I made your favorite. Grilled cheese and tomato soup. Bridget, I got the tray. You want to talk about it? No. Bunchy : Hey. Remember the last time we did this? We beat the crap out of Charlie Conway and his brothers. Wasn't he trying to take your lunch money or something? It wasn't exactly my lunch money. I just said that. It was money I made selling coke I stole from Dad. Jesus. (quiet laugh) What the f*ck am I doing? Remember when Bridget got suspended? Which time? She set her purse on fire. (laughs) She what? What? I don't remember this. She was smoking in the bathroom at school, and someone came in. She wanted to save the butt. Thought she put it out, stuck it in her purse. She got back to class, and the purse went up in flames. (all laughing) Ah, sh1t. We get there... I go in alone. So, Ray said get rid of everything that's federal. Anything that could bring federal charges. He say why? No. Jesus Christ. Everything we've done here for the last 15 years would bring federal charges. Hmm, you want me to take over for a while? No, that's okay. I have it. Can I have some? Um... so, what happened with that woman? (groans) She's a f*cking hypocrite. Why? Won't leave her husband. She's using me. It's a mid-life crisis, fuck-a-lesbian kind of thing. Really? Yeah. So, why don't you talk to her? About what? I don't know. Your feelings. You have feelings, don't you? Not really. No. You should talk to her. Tell her you love her. But I don't love her. Tell her anyway. It's good to talk things through. Listen to me. I'll think about it. (indistinct chatter) Hey, you! (grunts) RAY: Ooh. (grunting) Uh-oh. Sir? No, you don't want to do that. Gene! Ah, geez. Break it up, guys. Come on. Break it up. They got it under control. Come on, that's not fair. See? Ah, sh1t. Ter? Ah, Bunch, what the f*ck are you doing? He's already down! Okay! Okay! Get up! Get up! I'm sorry. All right? I didn't know she was married. But you don't hit a lady. She's not a lady; she's a f*cking whore. Get in the car, you maniac. Ooh. Ain't this something? Unisex. So, tell me about yourself, Mickey. I got five kids. Four boys. One girl. She's gone. Oh, I'm sorry. Drugs. Four of them, I had with my first wife. She died of cancer. The youngest, I had with my girlfriend. She's married now. She lives in Palm Springs with a big producer. Allen Weisbrod. I know Allen. Are you talking about Claudette? Yeah. Claudette. Ain't that something? We're practically related. You're an interesting man, Mickey. I thought all you guys from Boston were racist. Not me. I'm not prejudiced. I don't like black men much. You're a trip. Maybe we could collaborate on something. (exhales) ABBY:  Hey, Juliet. It's Mrs. Donovan, Abby. I was just wondering if you'd seen Bridget. I haven't seen her. Um... if-if she's with you, I'm not angry. I promise I won't be mad or anything. Just... can you tell her to call me? Thanks. 
 
 (phone ringing) Hello? Hey. I just called the house and no one picked up. I'm just out doing errands. She okay? Yeah, she's fine. She's sleeping. All right. I'll see you later. (beep) Terry : Why isn't Bridget in school? She got her belly button pierced. So? What's wrong with that? We had a deal. Nothing till she's 18. You're a hard man, Ray. What are you talking about? Eh, you got to be careful with girls. You got to be... gentle. (chuckles) (snorts, laughs) What? You don't even have kids, Ter. Yeah, you got a girl now. Now you're a f*cking expert? Right? f*ck you. Kids need rules. (phone vibrating) Yeah, Av. You hear from the Armenian yet? He's on his way here, and he's pissed off. Good. Kids need love. I got something I got to take care of. I'll be back, though, finish what we started. Suit yourself. All the way down, baby. (men speaking indistinctly) (horn honks) (siren wailing) (woman speaking indistinctly) Hey, Lena. She expecting you? What are you doing here? Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you... (gasps) Oh, my God! I think you broke my nose! Wendy, call security! Oh, my God! Hello again. How are you? Good. Very relaxed. I, uh... I just got a rubdown. Liked everything but the music. So, Mickey, would you like to go and get a drink? Well, I live over in Hollywood. Got a bottle of Jameson. The place belongs to my son. But it ain't no place for a lady like you. You don't want to go there. Well, I'm tougher than I look. I like living on the edge. Yeah? I'll see you in the lobby. Okay. Is this where your mom died? Yeah. Hey, no. No, don't be crying, boo. It's okay. She put herself there. You think you intimidate me? You M*therf*ckers. I'll kill you. What the f*ck? You burn my f*cking... (sighs) Tie him up. I'm gonna go get some coffee. Oh. Ladies fist. We're out of toilet paper. Uh-huh. You know how to twerk? Twerk? What? We'll get to that. (chuckles) Do you have any ice? Ice. She's so pretty. (Bridget chuckles) I'm sorry I was rough, shawty. I f*cked up. It's okay. I'm sorry, too. What did my father do to you? (sighs) Nothing. (sighs) Brought me back where I belong. You don't belong here. Yeah, I do, shawty. My house, too. I was born here. I'm gonna make a music video... right here in the crime scene. Re-Kon says my street cred's gonna go through the roof. I think you're brave, Marvin. Well, I'm the black Obi-Wan, baby. Strike me down, I come back two times stronger. (laughs) Look at me. Look at me. You took advantage of my brother. What you mean, "took advantage"? He's grown man. I want the f*cking money back. No way. Go f*ck yourself. (Taser clicking, Aram groaning) f*ck you! Let's try this again. (Aram pants) I want my brother's money back. Not all of it. There was fire. Smoke damage very bad. (Taser clicking, Aram groaning) (loud groaning) (panting) I want the money back. Okay. I make settlement, huh? Half. (Taser clicking, Aram groaning) (loud groan, sigh) All. (panting) Okay, okay. You take check? Cash. Can't do. No cash. Okay! Yes, cash. Keep him here till you get the money. Okay. Hi, boss. Where you going? Got a family thing. Hi. Hey. So, did you talk to her? Yeah, sort of. And how'd it go? Not bad. So, that's federal, right? Yeah. (footsteps approaching) You want to see my belly button piercing? Yeah. Dang, that hurts. (laughs) Let me see. Ew! My f*cking parents overreacted. You know, you're lucky you have folks who care about you so much. I want to have s*x. I do. I don't think so. Why not? Why not, Marvin? 'Cause your father put a f*cking gun in my mouth. That's why. It's why I'm sleeping here. It's why I'm not coming back to Calabasas. I shouldn't even be touching you. I'm staying here tonight. (sighs) (phone ringing) Bridget. Mrs. Donovan, it's Marvin. Bridget's here with me. Oh, thank God. Where are you? It's for your own good, baby girl. (distant siren wailing) Whiskey. It's good. Yeah. It's good. (laughs) (smacks lips) I was good-looking back in the day. You're good-looking now. (laughs) I don't think I could f*ck you. You're too old for me. How about a blow job? I couldn't. I'm kind of over it. (laughs) Ah, come on. You'd have to put a gun to my head. Would you excuse me for a minute? Get on your knees. Oh, God! Get on your knees. (crying): God. (glass clinking) Now, suck it. (crying) Suck it! (sobbing) Oh, sh1t. I thought I was following your lead. (sobbing) Oh, sh1t. I've been in the can for 20 years. Maybe I don't know how to be with women. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh... I'm... I'm gonna leave now. Don't try and stop me. Stop you? Stop you?! You think I could stick my dick in you with your white ass and your fake tits? Get the f*ck out of here, you f*cking tourist! (crying) Am I authentic enough for you? Huh? (door closes) Terry :  "May the road rise up to meet you. "May the wind be ever at your back. "May the sun shine warm upon your face "and the rain fall softly on your fields. "And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of his hand." What does that mean, "the hollow of his hand"? His palm? (laughing): And she didn't have no f*cking fields, either. (laughs) So they couldn't have been rained upon. Don't be disrespectful. I'm not. Hey, remember when we dislocated her shoulders? (laughs) Jesus, we did. We were pulling her between us, right? Yeah. We both wanted to play with her, so we kept pulling on her and pulling on her until... you heard that crack, crack. Dislocated both her shoulders. Ma beat me so bad I couldn't sit for a week. (laughs) Mickey did that to her. What, Ray? Her shoulders. Mickey did that to her. No, he didn't. Yeah, he did. He didn't, Raymond. Bunchy and I did. You sure? Sure, I'm sure. I remember getting beat for it. We both got the belt. Did you f*ck him? You don't use that language. You're from Calabasas. You're so upper-class. You're so spiritual. You and Daddy are racists. You're just a racist f*cking housewife! And you live with Daddy, who put a gun in Marvin's mouth! He's an animal. You're married to an animal. Shut up! Just f*cking shut up! (sniffles, exhales) (sniffles) If that boy got you pregnant, I'm not taking you for abortion. Have the kid. And ruin your f*cking life. You cut her pigtails off and threw 'em behind the radiator. I did? Yeah, you were jealous of her, so you waited till Ma wasn't around and you got her scissors and you whacked off her pigtails so she wouldn't look so f*cking cute. (laughs) You don't remember that? That whole winter, every time the radiator went on, Ma was like, "What's that smell?" "What's that smell?" (all laughing) Ah, my boys are here. Why all the sad faces? It's your daughter's birthday, you prick. What about my money, Ray? You're not getting that money back, Bunch. Why? We're going back to the old arrangement. I got things that I want to do. Things? What things? (quietly): Ever since he's been back here, he's been putting sh1t in your head. You've been drinking, out of control. Come on. (chuckles) Maybe you're right. He's been messing with my head. You're right. All right. It's my f*cking money! Do you have any idea what I had to go through to get that money back? Huh? I burned a building down and tortured a guy. I've always taken care of you, Bunch. And I always will. Yep, it's all here. Okay. Please. It's a pleasure doing business with you. You know, you're making a big mistake. 'Cause you had a great deal with that house. Very foolish. First you follow me home, then you beat up my husband? Eh, you knew I was gonna do that. That's why you come over here. He hit you. I threw the first punch. Good for you. Sweetheart, what are we doing? You're cheating on him. It's not fair. Fair? Who cares about fair? I'm in love with you. There are arrangements that people live with. That's indecent. You can't go from his bed into mine. If it was so indecent, then why did you keep f*cking me? You knew about it. So... it's over between us. (chair creaks) (door opens) (door shuts) (footsteps approaching) You okay? Jesus, Ray, you stink. (chuckles) Come here. How's Bridg? She's a little bitch. (laughs) She thinks I'm an idiot and you're an animal. Well, she's right about one of us. (both laughing) I love you, Abs. All right, Ray. (laughs) I'll buy you anything you want. What do you want? (sighs) Huh? What I want, you can't give me. Try me. Emotional honesty. Oh, geez. You been seeing that same therapist you sent Bridget to? f*ck you. Maybe I should. All right. (grunts) (sighs) What would I tell him, Ray? Conor hitting that kid in the back of the head? The way we f*cked up our kids? We didn't f*ck up our kids. How you hate your father? The way we have to hide out in Calabasas? The way you f*ck? I thought you liked the way I f*ck. I do. It taps right into my own issues. (laughs) You're f*cking nuts, you know that? Am I? Why was there a handcuff in your bathroom? You had a girl in there, didn't you? Oh, come on, Abs. Make up your mind. I'm in love with a dead girl, I'm in love with a live girl. Which is it? You tell me. You're f*cking crazy. There's nothing to tell. I could smell her on you. What? That night when I went to your apartment and surprised you. I could smell her s*x on you. (sighs) (shoes squeaking softly) I need confession. (crickets chirping) I'm gonna start. May I ask your name? Terrence. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. How long has it been since your last confession? Three years. It's a sin not to go to church. You're here now. What do you wish to confess? I committed adultery. You're married, and you've transgressed? The other way around. I'm not following. I'm not married. She's  married. It's a mortal sin. You've been here less than two minutes, and you've already committed two sins. What's your point? You're very hard on yourself. God doesn't condemn us. (sniffling) (indistinct chatter) Woman : Here you go. (indistinct chatter) (laughter, indistinct chatter) (van doors closing) Priest :  What's on your heart, Terry? Do you live alone? Yeah. Is that hard? Is it lonely? I committed adultery. Plain and simple. Do you intend to stop? You know, Terry, everyone needs love. You're not helping me. Bridget : Come in. Hey. Hey. Am I in trouble, Daddy? Not with me. Are you drunk? A little. Why? It's your Auntie Bridget's birthday, and, uh... my brothers and I-- we like to raise a glass to her every year we're together. That's beautiful. (sighs) Remember when I told you that, uh, she killed herself? I didn't tell you why. She was pregnant. And she was on drugs. See, honey, that's why... that's why I worry about you so much, 'cause... ...some things in life, you can't take back. Some things change you forever. Ow. What? My piercing hurts. You didn't take it out? No. Bridg. Aah. Oh, Jesus Christ. Mmm. Oh. Oh, that looks sore. I know. It hurts, Daddy. Oh, sweetheart. Come here. (sighs) This bed is so freaking small. I know. I thought it was just me. It is you. (laughs) You're big. God, you got so big. You remember that song you used to sing to me when I was little? Yeah. Will you sing it with me?
