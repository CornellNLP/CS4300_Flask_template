 Terry : Daryll "Black Irish" Donovan? 
 Mickey : Yeah, he's black and he's Irish. 
 (laughing): What do you want? 
 Why me, Raymond? 
 'Cause I want the last person he sees to hate him as much as I do. 
 I'm doing this thing my way using my tools. 
 Sean :  How the f*ck did he breach my security? 
 Ray :  It's my problem, and I'm gonna take care of it. 
 (grunting) 
 The priest that molested Bunchy-- they moved him out of that parish ten years ago. 
 You killed his brother, you moron. 
 I write, too. 
 Maybe we could collaborate on something. 
 I don't think I could f*ck you. 
 You're too old for me. 
 How about a blow job? 
 You'd have to put a gun to my head. 
 Get on your knees. 
 God. 
 Mickey :  I optioned my life rights to Sean Walker. 
 This movie is gonna be f*cking huge. 
 Amen, m*therf*cker. 
 (laughter) 
 I'll buy you anything you want. 
 What I want, you can't give me. 
 Try me. 
 Emotional honesty. 
 Oh, geez.

 Fite Nite 
 Original Air Date on September 8, 2013 
 (panting) 
 (panting continues) 
 (grunting) 
 Mickey : Up the middle. 
 On the side, down the pipe. 
 All right, now dig in those punches. 
 Dig in, dig, dig, dig. 
 There you go. Chop that tree. 
 He is going down. 
 Boom! 
 Conor : Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Look at this. 
 (chuckles) 
 You and Uncle Terry used to box? 
 Yeah, Bunchy, too. 
 He hated it. 
 (both laugh) 
 You know what my father used to do if we ever lost a fight? 
 Grandpa? 
 Yeah. 
 He beat us till we were black and blue, teach us to take a proper punch. 
 Did you cry? 
 Did I cr...? 
 No, I didn't cry. 
 Made us not want to lose, you know what I mean? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Might want to untie those first. 
 (chuckles) 
 (knocking) 
 Ezra. 
 Come in. 
 Is he expecting you? 
 No, dear. 
 Hi. 
 He's upstairs; I'll get him. 
 You gonna teach me? 
 What do you want to learn to fight for? 
 Because you did. 
 (chuckles) 
 Come here. 
 (sighs) 
 You know, you're the last male Donovan. 
 Yeah. 
 You have to have some boys of your own, keep the family name alive. 
 Abby : Ray? 
 Ezra's here. 
 Conor, go get dressed. 
 This place is too f*cking hot. 
 You think this is hot? 
 It's 106 degrees in the Maldives. 
 I Googled it. 
 When do we get the passports? 
 After we're done. 
 You're still taking me with you, right? 
 (laughing): Uh, yeah. 
 f*cking sharks will love you over there, Big Gulp. 
 The Indian Ocean is full of them. 
 What? 
 You're a walking f*cking billboard, and I'm supposed to be invisible, remember? 
 (knocking) 
 I'll get it. 
 Oh, f*cking finally. 
 f*ck this town. 
 I had to walk at least seven blocks before I could find a store that sold real meat. 
 f*cking tofu. 
 Sully : Yeah, well... 
 I walked back from this Venice Beach. 
 I never saw so many freaks in my whole life. 
 I had one guy shouting at his own f*cking shoe. 
 (all laughing) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Talking to his shoe. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 It's all there. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 Ruth's foundation. 
 Jesus, Ezra. 
 I couldn't take it out of the business. 
 Lee would have a heart attack. 
 This is her legacy, Raymond, but there won't be a legacy if I'm dead and you're in prison. 
 You're not dying. 
 Not yet. 
 Listen to me. 
 You got out of Boston. 
 You built a good life. 
 You have a beautiful family. 
 Don't let Mickey poison this. 
 I saw something in you, Raymond. 
 Don't let me down. 
 I won't. 
 When does he get it? 
 Tonight. 
 Where will you be? 
 Fite Nite at the gym. 
 Sully's gonna call me when it's done. 
 Well, make sure you stay there until he does. 
 That's your alibi. 
 Coffee? 
 Oh, no, thank you, Abby. 
 I was just leaving. 
 We did the right thing then, and we're doing the right thing now. 
 For everyone. 
 (door opens) 
 (door closes) 
 (priest speaking indistinctly) 
 Father? 
 Yes? 
 Remember me? 
 (chuckling): I'm sorry. Who... 
 Who are you? 
 It's me, Father Danny. 
 It's Brendan. 
 Brendan Donovan. 
 Miguel, go-go wait in the car. 
 I think there must be some mistake. 
 (car door closes) 
 No mistake. 
 It's you. 
 (chuckles) 
 We don't know each other. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 Are you? 
 (sighs) 
 (engine starts) 
 (stomping) 
 (breathing heavily) 
 (exhales) 
 He's coming at you, coming at you. 
 He's gonna try to slip, get inside. 
 Boom, boom, you know what I mean? 
 But you are gonna slip him. 
 Boom. Oh, no, sucker, you're coming in. 
 Boom! 
 Out. 
 The man is out. 
 What is this bullshit? 
 It's pasta. 
 You know what we used to eat in the day? - What? 
 We used to chip in so that the contender could eat a f*cking steak, rare. 
 Enough of this bullshit. 
 Hey, come on, man. 
 Hey, Terry. 
 Yo. 
 Bring that thing we got for Daryll. 
 So, how you feel, champ? 
 (sighs) 
 You ready? 
 Yeah, I'm ready. 
 That's good Boston blood coursing through your veins. 
 Here, here's something for you. 
 What's that? 
 Wait till you see this. 
 Look at that. 
 Wow. 
 (chuckles) 
 Best of both worlds, huh? 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 I appreciate it. 
 Oh, man. 
 Listen, the guy you're fighting tonight is a real comer. 
 He's 13-2. 
 He's going pro after tonight. 
 Okay, no problem. 
 No. 
 It is a problem, Daryll, all right? 
 Now, don't get cocky. 
 Okay, I get it, Terry. 
 Just put everything out of your mind. 
 Get some rest today. 
 I'll see you later. 
 You're coming back, right? 
 Listen to me. 
 You made a trip cross-country on a f*cking bus. 
 15 years old, skinny little kid. 
 Walked right into Walpole, asking to see me. 
 That took f*cking guts. 
 You were there for me. 
 I'm there for you. 
 Next time you see me, I'll have my glad rags on. 
 (laughs) 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, didn't expect to hear from you again, sweetheart. 
 Sure. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 Good. 
 Hey, Bunch. 
 Ray was right. 
 What? 
 You killed the wrong f*cking guy, Pop. 
 What the f*ck are you talking about? 
 Father Danny. 
 He's here in L.A. 
 I seen him. 
 Aw, you're imagining things. 
 Jesus f*cking Christ, boy! 
 How many years you gonna feel sorry for yourself? 
 Stop being a crybaby. 
 Be a man. Deal with it. 
 Deal with it. 
 What was Ezra doing here? 
 He never comes here. 
 You're gorgeous. 
 You know that? 
 Do you know how beautiful you are? 
 Let's make another baby. 
 (laughs) 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 No, I'm not kidding. 
 Come on. 
 I want to make another little Donovan. 
 You think a Band-Aid baby's gonna solve all our problems? 
 Dream on, buster. 
 Sleepless nights at my age? 
 You f*cking kidding me? 
 I want a house. 
 I know you want a house. 
 In Trousdale. 
 Trousdale, huh? 
 That little southie girl's got expensive taste. 
 (laughs) 
 Come on. 
 (laughing) 
 Let's make another baby. 
 What's going on with you, Ray? 
 What do you mean? 
 What do you mean? 
 Why are we going to the fight tonight? 
 I told you. It's time the kids to get to know the family better. 
 Since when? 
 Is Mick gonna be there? 
 I don't know. 
 Probably. 
 What's your point? 
 The last time you were all together, you pulled a gun on him. 
 Yeah, I did, didn't I? 
 I want to know how you and Mick resolved it. 
 Resolved it? 
 (laughs) 
 (sighs) 
 What do you think? 
 I don't want my kids getting hurt. 
 You f*cking understand me, Ray? 
 I don't want them exposed. 
 They won't be. 
 I promise. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Surprised to hear from you. 
 What you did to me was heinous. 
 Do you understand? 
 I was traumatized. 
 It was a horrible thing. 
 I could have called the police. 
 I could have pressed charges. 
 Yeah, well, you didn't. 
 Why'd you call me? 
 I need to know something. 
 Have you ever done that before? 
 Never. 
 I would never do that to a woman. 
 I'm a feminist. 
 (chuckles quietly) 
 I-I need to know if I asked for that. 
 I-I... 
 I have a very dark shadow side. 
 And I need to understand what I'm putting into the world. 
 Shadow side, huh? 
 Me, too. 
 Hmm. 
 God... 
 Mickey... 
 I've gone to some very bad places in my life trying to be brave. 
 I hear you. 
 So have I. 
 So we have that in common. 
 (laughs) 
 In spades. 
 The stories I could tell you. 
 Stories I could tell. 
 Look. 
 I really was following your lead. 
 I thought that's what you... that's what you wanted. 
 (laughs) 
 That's for you. 
 What is it? 
 Here you go, sweetheart. 
 What's this for, Daddy? 
 What, I need a reason to treat my favorite girls? 
 Diamond studs from Tiffany, Ray? 
 It's an important day. 
 Why? 
 Bridget : We're meeting Uncle Daryll today. 
 He's fighting. 
 What's he like? 
 Abby : He's nice. 
 I think you'll like him. 
 Conor : Dad? 
 How old were you when you started boxing? 
 I don't know. 
 I was wearing gloves before I could walk. 
 Did you have a boxing name? 
 (laughs) 
 What do you need that for? 
 You do your talking in the ring, not on a poster. 
 Come on, did you have any nicknames, Daddy? 
 Nope. 
 I was always Mickey's boy. 
 Heir to the throne. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Terry : Hey. 
 I didn't think you'd come. 
 Why not? I said we were coming. 
 You look nice, Abby. 
 Great turnout. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey! Here you go. 
 Try these on. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's Grandpa? 
 Why don't you introduce yourself to your new uncle? 
 Oh, where is he? 
 Which one is he, Dad? 
 Right there. 
 How can  he  be our uncle? 
 Oh, my God, you're a moron. 
 He has a different mom. 
 I still don't understand. 
 (scoffs) 
 He's half-black, sweetheart. 
 Buy you a drink? 
 Yeah. 
 Can we get two whiskeys? 
 You got it. 
 What's up with him? 
 I don't know. 
 He's been acting weird lately. 
 Either he's out all day and no one knows where he is or he just sleeps. 
 Sláinte. 
 Sláinte. I'm surprised I could f*ck you. You're really not my type. My tits are real, by the way. And my bony white ass didn't seem to bother you, Mick. (exhales) Yeah, life is full of surprises. Where you going? Home. I just needed some closure on this with you. Hang out for a little while. Come on, you're fun. Wait 20 minutes, you get some more closure. Nah, this is what it was. Going home. Now, where did I put my bag? (Linda screams) (crying) Sully : Put on some clothes, Mick. We're going for a drive. You moving in? What, do you miss me? How's the door? Not bad. Should be enough for the next few months' rent on the gym. Keep it. I don't need it. You may not need it, but I owe it. I pay my debts. (snorts) Relax. I didn't say you didn't. Come on, Terry. It's your big night. Go have some fun. What's going on with you, Ray? I've been doing Fite Nite for years. You come, what, three times? Why tonight? (chuckles) Where's Mick? I don't know. He got a call earlier. Sounded like he was hooking up with some broad. He'll be here. He wouldn't miss Daryll's fight for the world. Don't be so sure. What's that supposed to mean? Means don't be so sure. When has he ever been there for any of us? He's changed. No, I really think he has. You should talk to him. Yeah... maybe I should. (sighs) (sobbing) Well, look, this about the money I took in the robbery? Long time ago, Sully. Did it for a chick. Yeah, the f*cking nigger. Love is love. We had a kid. Ought to take care of your own. My mother always said that. How is your mother? She's all right. Thanks for asking. I always liked her. She's still alive, huh? Yeah, she's still alive. That's a blessing. Losing your mom-- that's a big one. That's a big one. That sh1t ain't gonna work, Mick. So just be a man and shut the f*ck up. So, how'd you find me? (chuckles) I didn't. Ray found me. (bell clangs, crowd clamoring) Hey. It's a good fight, huh? Yeah. We're looking forward to your fight, Daryll. Right? Yeah, I can't wait. When'd you two meet? I brought the kids by one day. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Hey, Ray, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure. What's-What's up with you, man? Do you blame me for Mickey leaving your moms? I don't blame you. You weren't born. I blame him. Okay, so why'd you have me beat up? I think we both know the answer to that. I was helping out my pops. Yeah. Look, let's, uh, let's put it aside tonight, all right? I came here to see you fight. Hey! I didn't bring my son here to see a Donovan lose. All right? All right. Kick his ass. What was that about? Don't worry about it. Okay, I won't. I'm gonna get another beer... 
 
 Ray the Rocket. What? You  did  have a nickname. That's what me and the girls used to call you. Ray the Rocket. (chuckles) Sully : Come on, get out, get the f*ck out. Stay right there. Don't f*cking move. Please, God! Please, God! (sobbing) Get up! Shut her up. Got her? What was I supposed to do? I was in prison. I had to save my skin. I know what you did. You ratted out my whole family. Poor Robbie, dying of the virus in there. It wasn't my fault. He got AIDS before I ratted him out. He was a secret fag. Yeah. Taking it up the ass in secret. Come on. All right, he was half a fag. I walked in on him once. Scared the sh1t out of me. I didn't know what the f*ck they were doing. It  is  confusing. Up here. Go on. I'm still working for the FBI. That's a big f*cking surprise, Mick. Another good reason to kill you. That's why they let me out early. They wanted me to help them bring down Ray and his boss Ezra Goldman, the fuckers that set me up. Set you up for what? Doesn't matter. But it probably explains why Ray hired you to kill me and didn't do it himself. What are you getting at? He knows the feds are watching him. Maybe he's trying to set you up, too. Just talking a load of sh1t, Mick. Just a load of sh1t. Mmm. Thanks. Yeah, no problem. What the f*ck are you doing here? I'm here to collect the money once it's done. That's not the deal. I'm supposed to bring it to you. Yeah, well, uh, Sully don't trust you. Sully can go f*ck himself. I'm here, Ray. If I leave, it don't get done. Your choice. Bunchy, what's the matter? Nothing. I'm fine. Bunch... You stay away from my family, you hear me? What's going on, Bunch? He's upset. Ray : What are you upset about? The whole family's here. I thought that's what you wanted. We're not all here, are we? What's that supposed to mean? (sniffs) Terry said Mick was out with some broad. Who the f*ck knows? Maybe he took off again. What the f*ck are you talking about? He wouldn't leave us. You got a short memory, don't you, Bunch? Forget about Claudette? Hmm? Poor Mom dying in front of us while he's across town screwing her? You don't remember me and Terry cooking and cleaning for you? Taking you and Bridget to school? 'Cause I sure f*cking do. Kneel down, honey. This is gonna be over fast. (Linda crying) Mickey : It's not the way things are done, Sully. You know that. You kill a woman for passion, not business. This is business. She don't belong here. (crying): My ex-husband is very, very rich. He'll pay you. Yeah? Linda : Please. Please. How much? Linda : How much do you want? 100 grand. Anything. He'll... he'll pay you anything. Cut her loose. She's a witness. Just do it. (sighs) Oh... Come on. (grunts) Sully : Come on. Come here. Now, sweetheart, I want you to walk back down to the car. Do you know the way? Yes. Do you? Yes! All right, now, you wait there for us. Okay. All right. Now go ahead. (sobs) Thank you. All right. Go ahead. (exhales) (crying) What the f*ck? I needed you to see that, Mick. An eye for an eye. What are you talking about? Never mind. Come on. Throw her in. (steadying breaths, grunts) (grunting) Stand by the hole, Mick. Come on, Sully. Don't-don't throw me in with her. I hardly knew the broad. (chuckles) f*cked her for the first time today. All right. (sighs) Dig another hole for Mickey. (indistinct chatter) Who's the toughest Donovan, Uncle Bunch? I don't know. I know it's not me. Your pop and Uncle Terry ever start scrapping, I won't get in the way. Is Dad really that tough? Are you kidding me? Really? Yeah. Had a big reputation back in Southie. Lot of people saying he was gonna be tougher than Mickey. What about Uncle Daryll? Is he tough? I don't know. Maybe. He's only half a Donovan, but... he's probably... tough. Tougher than me. Everybody's tougher than me. Listen to me. You need to be as tough as your old man 'cause there's some f*cking snakes out there. Don't ever let anybody take advantage of you. You hear me? Okay, I won't. Good. (grunting) It was Ray's idea... to disappear me or yours? Bit of both. Ray didn't want his kids... seeing Grandpa's dead body on the news. Me? I'm a professional. Tiny : This is bullshit. He should dig his own grave. Thanks for this. Appreciate it. I don't want to get... torn apart by wild animals. (chuckles) Remember that? Us? (chuckles) Who was that guy... that guy we didn't bury right? Uh, Sam... Sam f*cking something. Saul. Saul Hardy. Saul, that's him. Saul f*cking Hardy. Yeah. Well remembered, huh? Stray dog dragged his body away. His femur ended up down in Dorchester. S-Some kid was playing f*cking stickball with it. Hit a double with Saul's f*cking femur. (both chuckle) (sniffs, groans, mutters) Come on, Tiny. f*ck's sake, it's getting cold out here. Come on. (Tiny grunts) (shoveling continues) (bell dings) (cheering) (cheering and applause) (Abby whistles loudly) That's degrading to women. Where'd you learn that? Your feminist theory class? Don't be facetious, Mom. Lighten up, Bridg. I'm just trying to have some fun. (cheering and applause) (laughing): Conor seems to like her. Shut up. Go get a soda. I want to talk to your dad. Who's that old guy, Ray? Ray : Nobody. Who is he? He's nobody. What's with all the f*cking questions? Referee : Seconds out. Mouthpieces in. Round three coming up. (bell dings) (cheering) Keep moving, Daryll. You got to stay warm. Since when do you care what I do? Keep f*cking moving, Daryll. Seriously, Terry, where's Mickey at? I don't know. Well, I need him here. I need him in my corner. He'll be here. (blows landing) Hi. I'm Abby Donovan. Yeah. Hi. Abby : It's a good fight, huh? Eh. So, how do you know Ray? Eh, we go back. You from Southie? Yeah. You a friend of Mick's? Time to do this, Mick. (grunts) I understand... your reasons, Sully. But Ray. Did you even f*cking ask him why? I don't care why, Mick. Ray's paying me. But you know what? I'd gladly do this for free. Not for the money you stole. And not for putting my whole f*cking family away. But for her. Who? Colleen... Dawson. Ray's old girlfriend? (chuckles) You were f*cking her, too? (Mickey grunts) I wasn't f*cking her, you piece of sh1t. I loved her. Yeah. Yeah, I was seeing her, f*cking too. (grunts) Had a little place picked out in Cohasset for us. And then you f*cking killed her. (labored breathing) (chuckles) What's so funny? You got the wrong guy, pal. What are you talking about? I didn't kill Colleen. I point a gun to your head and you're innocent all of a sudden? Get real, Mick. You went to prison because of it. I swear to you I did not kill that girl. And I can prove it. Just f*cking shoot him, Sully. (cheering in background) (sighs) ♪ ♪ (door opens) (door shuts) Talk to me, sweetheart. You don't want a house in Trousdale. No? No. You're Abby Kelly from Mercer Street. And what do I want? You just want to get f*cked. (moaning) What are you doing? I'm f*cking you. (panting): Where's Mick? You think I'm stupid? The bag from Ezra? The guy from Southie? What did you do? I'm sorry. I'm so f*cking sorry. (sniffles) Look at me. Look at me... look at me. I'm your wife. It's me. Don't ruin this. Ray. (cheering) Sully just called. It's been done. You hear me? I hear you. You don't seem too happy about it. I'll get you the money. (cheering) Yeah! Man : You'd better take my advice and leave him alone. Shame, shame, you're a bad boy. The skunk cage is always a center of interest. (doorbell rings) Mickey : Seany-boy. Are you in there? It's me, Mickey. I was in the neighborhood, and I, uh... I got inspired. (whispering): Do you know what time it is, Mick? I'm trying to get my baby to go to sleep. But I got a great idea for the ending. A real humdinger. (baby cooing) Let me in. Let me in. (beeps) (indistinct chatter) (coughing) (panting): No. Mickey, please help me. I can't, kid. (gunshot, Sean grunts) Terry : You're the main event, Daryll. You can't back out. People are waiting. I'm waiting for Mickey. He said he'd be here. Geez. What's going on? Terry : He wants Mick in his corner. I tried calling him, but his phone's off. I told him I'd step up, but he ain't having it. It's not the same, Pie. Besides, man, you don't even like me. Don't be such a pussy, Daryll. Forget you, old man. I said I'm waiting for Mick. Ray : f*ck Mick. You don't need him. You a Donovan or not? Hell, yeah, I'm a Donovan. Yeah? Then, get used to that prick letting you down. You get off your ass and go show those f*cking people who you are. (indistinct chatter and laughter) (phone buzzes) Is everything all right? Where's Uncle Daryll? He'll be out soon. (phone rings) (phones ringing and chiming) Woman : Whoa. News anchor (on TV) : We're just receiving reports about a major incident at movie star Sean Walker's home in Bel Air tonight. Steve. Steve : Unverified account that a body has been found. It's believed to be the body of Sean Walker, who burst on the scene with the cult classic  Black Mass  and continued to break all box office records with his stream of hit films. So far his public relations team... Shame about Sean Walker. Hear there's a lunatic on the loose. ...never been evidence of wild parties at the Walker estate and he has been nothing but an exemplary neighbor. This news will obviously come as a huge shock to the entire Hollywood community as well as... What'd you do? What did  you  do? Raymond, what did  you  do? Did you know Sully was f*cking your little girlfriend Colleen behind your back? He found out who killed her. And he knows who covered it up. I'd watch  your  back, kid. Ray? Ray! (footsteps running) Will you just f*cking stop? What's going on? What did you do? Why don't you trust me, huh? I'm your goddamn husband! Doesn't that f*cking count for something?! Why are you always taking his side?! (panting) You're wrong about him. What the f*ck are you talking about?! I know him! I wrote to him for years in Walpole. I sent him money, I sent him pictures of the kids. I was the one who asked him to come to L.A., Ray. You don't know what the f*ck you're doing. (Abby sighs heavily) (door opens) (door slams) (indistinct crowd chatter) Mickey : Abby, me darling. Sorry I'm late. Something about, uh, Ray's client, huh? Shame. Mick. I told you he'd come. I f*cking told you he'd come. Good to see you, Dad. You, too, pal. You, too. What the f*ck happened to you? Ran into an old friend. So, what's going on? We ready to go or what? Yeah, yeah, we're ready. I want to see you knocking seven bells of sh1t out of that m*therf*cker. You hear me? I f*cking hear you. You hear me? I hear you, Dad. (laughing): You hear me? Yeah, Terry, huh? All right, all right, let's get the focus back. Get back into the routine, okay? Potato pie : Remember the game plan: stay on this guy. (crowd cheering) Vaseline. (applause and cheering) Yeah, let's go! Check your mouthpiece. All right, good luck. Go get some, bro. Okay, don't let him back you up. You're a f*cking Donovan, boy. Huh? Do me proud! It's your fight. Crowd (chanting) : Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! (cheering, bell clangs) (sighs) (phone rings) Ezra : What happened, Raymond? (Ray sighs) Sully. And Mickey's still alive. Ruth's money? Gone. (sighs) How are we gonna fix this, Raymond? ("Banshee" by Kendra Morris playing) (grunting) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (baby utters) (baby utters)
