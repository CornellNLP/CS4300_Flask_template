 Ray :  Previously on  Ray Donovan: 
 Yeah. 
 Harriet : We have a problem. 
 I just got a call from your brother. 
 He wants to sell the gym, Ray. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Something about moving to Ireland. 
 You told me this day would never come. 
 You promised me. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Terry : You're the love of my life. 
 Come to Ireland and marry me. 
 Your brother murdered that priest, didn't he? 
 That priest raped him. 
 Your brother scares me to death. 
 You're so f*cking beautiful. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Ashley :  I need you to come to the expo. 
 Ray : Ashley... 
 Ashley : This is not for me; it's for a friend. 
 He needs your help. 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Do you know what I do? 
 Ray : Yeah. 
 You write books. 
 Steve :  I'm in some trouble here. 
 I'm leaving my wife for her. 
 You know what that means, right? No. It means hundreds of millions of dollars. There she is. Keith : That woman is the mother of your child? She's the love of my life. I'll be damned. Potato Pie :  Terrance told me you got a date. Told me you looked stressed about it, too. Bunchy : What is it? Soon as something gonna happen between you and your lady, take it. Well, then what? Pop goes the weasel. Bridget :  His name is Marvin. Bridg’, why didn’t you say anything? Abby : You beat the sh1t out of him. You think she's gonna confide in you now? I didn't lay a finger on him. I'm seeing him again. And there's nothing you can do about it. Sweetheart, that boy has real problems. Marvin : Hey, Cookie! Boy, I love the way you sing, my nigga. We need to talk business real soon. Aren't you gonna invite me in? (birds singing) (Skype ringtone plays) Happy birthday, little dude! Wow. I can't believe you remembered. So how are you? I'm okay. Just okay? Yeah. I don't think anyone remembered my birthday. Really? What, no plan, no... no party? No. That's f*cked up. Hey. Be bold, brother. You want to have a party, you have a f*cking party. All right. (phone buzzing) (sighs) What are you doing in London? I'm just picking up shots on this movie I did last summer. London's kind of freaking me out, though. I'm... I'm a little lonely. I'm sucking dick again. Your father had to help me take care of that last time, remember? I think so. (knocking on door) (girls giggling) Okay, little dude, I got a surprise for you. One, two, three. Happy birthday, Conor! (giggling) (laughing) Tommy : Happy birthday, buddy! Abs? (phone ringing) (knocking at door) (laughs) This is okay? Yeah. (sighs) I'm sorry about last night. I was overwhelmed. I thought about you all night. Me, too. I've only had s*x with one person in 20 years. So I... I only know how to do it like my husband likes it. Don't worry about it. How much do we like each other? (laughing): A lot! A lot. Yeah. Mm-hmm. (phone ringing) I... What? (sighs) It's Ray. It's the second time. I gotta take it. I’m sorry. (sighs) What's up? Where are you? It's Conor's birthday. I know that. I'm on my way to the bakery. What are we doing for him? I don't know, Ray. Why don't you ask your son what he wants to do? I'm getting the cake. (exhales) What is it? (sighs) I forgot my son's birthday. Who does that? It's today? Yeah. You have all day to fix it. Come here. No, I... don't. I need to go. I just got here. I'm sorry. Will I see you later? I'm sorry. I don't know. Abby, look... I'm confused right now. Happy birthday, kiddo. Want to go see the Lakers tonight? I can get floor seats from Ezra. What's wrong, Conor? You forgot my f*cking birthday. You're right. Sorry. I'll make it up to you. We'll go see the Lakers tonight, have a great time. I don't even like the Lakers. What do you want? A party. A family party. Okay. No problem. I want Terry, Bunchy and Daryll. I'll call 'em. And Grandpa. I want the whole family here. Look, your uncles won't be a problem, but Grandpa Mick's on parole. He's got restrictions on him, Con. I don't want a party if Grandpa's not coming. (phone buzzing) All right. I'll see what I can do. Goddamn it, Ashley, what the f*ck are you... Steve : It's Steve Knight. When she calls you, that's me calling. Ray : I'm not working today. I got something planned with the family. I'm paying you $100,000 a month. That makes me family. Where are you? (TV playing indistinctly) (typewriter clacking) (exhales) Hey, Shorty. Shorty! Shorty : What?! I finished the treatment! It's f*cking great. The hero crosses water three times. (chuckles) Keith : Does he cross Melrose, too? What the f*ck were you doing at Paramount Pictures? Ain't I allowed to go to and from work? You have a job. I got a contract. Could be worth a million bucks. Sean Walker. The work I did with him got me in the door, and then I pitched 'em something else. They went nuts for it. Think I was gonna peel f*cking carrots the rest of my life? Hey, maybe you and me should team up. Start our own company, like Ray's. I finish the script... could use a hard-ass like you. (dialing) (phone ringing) Yo. Ray : Hey. It's Conor's birthday tonight. We're having a family dinner. How much do we pay a year in property tax? Christ, Terry, it's his birthday. You coming or not? Fine. But we have some things we have to talk about first. All right. And it can't wait past tonight. Tell Bunchy about the party. You should tell him yourself. Just him, Terry. Seven o’clock. Wait, wait, wait. What about Mick? He coming? Don't worry about Mick. (exhales) Bunchy : I'm in the bathroom. I take the Viagra. The moment I f*cking swallow it, there's a knock on the door. The kid comes home. (laughing) So it was a complete disaster. Uh, not really. Sounds like it. What happened then? (sighs) It got a little weird. (laughs) Then I left. So, you gonna see her again? Yeah. I really like her. And I think she likes me. Yeah, I know you like her, but you just started dating. Maybe you should see other people. Why? I mean, she's got a kid, Bunch. I mean, that's a lot of responsibility. I can handle it. What's wrong? Well, it sounds like you're having a lot of fun. I'm just really lonely right now. Why don't you come with me to my nephew's birthday party tonight? Really? Sure. It'll be fun. We got a problem. Come inside, I'll show you. Did you f*ck Ashley last night? 'Cause when I f*cked her this morning, I felt very close to you, Ray. What's going on with you, man? I'm getting a heavy vibe. Are you worried about your wife finding out? When I was 12 years old, I jerked off to my mother breastfeeding my baby sister. Unburden yourself! Try it. Say the unsayable thing. Tell me the thing that  you  are afraid of. Open the door. Radical honesty, Ray. I think you're a f*cking asshole, and I'm just using you for your money. We good now? Yeah! I love it! Was that so hard? I mean, did anything bad happen to you? We're just scratching the surface, baby. He's here again, Ray. Who? That creep who was stalking me. Lepecka? Come look. Don't let him see you. Steve : I'm in the middle of a divorce, and this guy's taking pictures of me with her? I'm f*cked. (camera shutter clicking) He's not interested in you. What the f*ck do I have to do to you, Bob? Oh, come on! Bob! (panting) Don’t hurt me. I'm protecting her. Give me the camera, Bob. Come on. He's the bad guy, Ray, not me. I don't go in her house. I don't try to hurt her. The worst thing I ever did was jerk off in her car. She left it open. Jesus Christ. Spare me the f*cking details. These are all taken, huh? Yeah. You don't have a single cake you can sell me? No, you got to order ahead of time. (sighs) Can I talk to you for a second? Come here. You seem like a nice kid. My son's about your age. Do me a favor. Take this money, wipe a name off one of the cakes, and put his name on it. Maybe someone won't pick one up. We're rated, like, number one in Calabasas. Yeah, you never know. His name's Conor. Hurry, please. Don't you have something you want to give me, Ray? Like what? The chip from the camera. I think I'm gonna hang onto that. You love being in control, don't you? You worried about me, or are you worried about him? I'm not sure yet. (laughs) I love our relationship, Ray. It just keeps getting better and better. Yeah. What are you doing, Bob? I had to sell my car. I can't drive anymore. You shattered the bones in my arm. I had to have surgery. On my leg, too. Get in the f*cking car. The back. Bob? Look at me, Bob. You go back there again... I know, I know. You'll kill me. (phone buzzing) (sighs) (sighs) You still live in that same sh1t hole? Yup. Your brother threatened me. He scares me. He'd never hurt you. It's my nephew's birthday. I don't want to go, Terry. It's my family, and you're part of it now. I want you to be there. (door opens) f*cking Saturday. It's hard to find a buyer in this market, Terry. I asked you how much the gym was worth. The value is determined on how much someone's willing... Why won’t you answer me, woman? Calm down, Terry. Just give her a chance. Let me talk to a couple commercial brokers and see what I can do. But you still can't sell it without Ray's consent. Why not? It's his gym. He's not the majority owner. Ray is. Don't worry about it. I'm seeing him tonight. Abby : Bridg’? Uh, Mom? Oh, f*ck. Just help me. (sighs) Mama, you know I can't stay for the party tonight. What do you mean? It's your brother's birthday. Marvin and I are recording tonight. They had to book the studio. It costs a lot of money. Besides, you and Daddy just invented this party out of nowhere. There was no plan. I don't care. You're staying, young lady. You came home late last night. Where were you? I was out with a friend. You don't have a friend. If you want to invite Marvin here, you can. Are you kidding? No. Daddy would kill him. It's my house, too. (phone ringing) Yeah? Your son invited me to his birthday party tonight. You got a problem with that? 'Cause I don't want to come if I'm not welcome. Look, if it's a problem, I'll just call him back and tell him I don't feel well. No, it's not a problem. So you'll handle it with that parole officer you hired? Yeah, sure. Why not? Oh, uh, one more thing. I got a date tonight. You're not bringing a hooker to Conor's birthday, Mick. Nah, it's a nice lady. You'll see. Cherry? Come here a minute. Shorty don't feel so good, and I'm going out. Why don't you keep him company? He's not contagious. Sure thing, Mick. No problem. Something happens, it happens. (hip-hop music plays in vehicle) What the f*ck are you doing here? We're going to the recording studio. No, you're not. Get back in the house. No. Get the f*ck off my property. Bridg’. Cookie : - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (music stops) Whoa, whoa. It's not baby girl's fault. Look, it's my bad, all right? Let's start over again. These kids... they misled me. Get your narrow ass back in that truck. I'm Cookie Brown. I know who you are. Look, man, Marvin told me we were just picking up a little friend. My sincere apologies. I'm a father, too. You work with Lee Drexler, right? Yep. Yeah. Tell that nigga he owe me a phone call. Got some business to discuss. Me and him and you. (engine starts) Back in the house. I hate you. Ain't this nice? Huh? (laughs quietly) Look at us together. Ain't this something? This is... this is beautiful. I've been dreaming about this night for 20 years. I'm surprised Ray invited me. He had such a hard time with us when he was a kid. Ah, he got over it. What are you gonna do? Hold onto the past? (chuckles) (laughs) What's up? Looking at you... driving. I remember when you were 12 years old. (laughing): You took the car, and you drove all over Palm Springs! (laughs quietly) Mm. Yeah. Oh. You know, I always loved this car. Oh. Put your cap on. I'm not putting my f*cking cap on, Mick, okay? I'm not your chauffeur. Really, Mick? All right. Take it easy. Take it easy. I didn't mean nothing. You look good in it, that's all. (sniffles) Is everyone coming? Yeah. Even Mick? Even Mick. So it's perfectly okay for him to come to the house now? You're best pals? It's your son's f*cking birthday. I'm trying. Where were you last night? I didn't feel like having dinner with you. No? Could have called or something. Sat there for, like, an hour. So where were you? You got some balls to ask me that. What time did you get in last night? And why'd you sleep downstairs? You have someone's stink on you? Zip me up. 
 
 (Wang Chung's "Dance Hall Days" playing) Terry : Con, get the blue one. Open the blue one. This one right here? Whoa. Those are gonna be collector's items. They're really beautiful, Terry. When I sell the gym, they'll probably change the name. Thank you. Grab his other leg. Abby : Oh, he's too old for that. No, he's not. Whoa. (laughter) What is this? Family tradition... one bump for every year. All : One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Be careful. (horn honking outside) Grandpa! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Hey. It’s bad luck not to finish the bumps. Conor, come here! Conor. (music continues in distance) Grandpa! Conor. Hey. Hey. My boy. My boy. Hey, Daryll. What's up, Con? Hey, meet my mom.  Conor : Okay. Mickey : Good. Conor : Hi. Hi. I'm Conor. I'm Claudette. Mickey : It's the birthday boy. Conor : Come on in. Thanks. Ray, you remember Claudette. Hey, Claudette. How are you? Hello, Ray. Thanks for inviting me. I was really touched. Sure. Come on in. What's up, Ray? How you doing, Daryll? (indistinct conversations) Hey, everyone. You all remember Claudette? Abby, me darling. Hey, Mick. This is Claudette. Claudette, it's very nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. A few good things, I hope. Absolutely. Welcome to our house. Claudette : I brought you something. Thank you. Let me get you something to drink. Thanks. My kids love Daryll. Thank you. (low, indistinct conversations) (sighs) I thought I said no whores, Mick. How's that little reporter friend of yours? She coming tonight? We need to talk. (sighs) Not now, Terry. It's a party. Now, Ray. I'm moving to Ireland. With Frances. We need to sell the gym. Why? What do you mean, why? (sighs) I'm just asking why, Terry. We need the money to start a business. That's how you become a citizen. (sighing) I don't know. It's not gonna be easy in this market, Terry. I mean, even if we decided... I decided. Just saying, you know, it doesn't happen overnight. So why'd you guys decide to move to Ireland? You know why. Come on, Terry. It's Conor's birthday. Can we not do this now? Ah, Jesus f*cking... Hey, Bunch. How are you? Doing good. I'm seeing somebody. Really? That's great. Wasn't it just one date? No, it was more than that. So what? I just don't know how you call it "seeing somebody" if it's just one date, right? How do you two know each other? The bike shop? SNAP. It's the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests. Thanks. I know what it is. Yeah, we got others in the family. My abuser actually was my scoutmaster. Not a priest. That's too bad. Dig in, guys. I need an answer. You're not getting it now, Terry. Give me a f*cking break. What'd you get him for his birthday, Ray Ray? We got him clothes, Mick. Really? Clothes, huh? I got you something really special. What is it? It's a surprise, kiddo. Thanks. Cheers, Mom. Hey, guys. How's it going? Pop. What's your name? Stan. Stan. You one of them Snappers? (chuckles) Yeah. Great. I got a good one for you. Pop... What's the difference between acne and a priest? Pop, don't. It's cool. Acne waits for a boy to be 14 before it comes on his face. (chuckles) (laughing) Excuse me. Think that's f*cking funny, Mick? Come on. What's wrong with everybody? (music begins playing) Ah. Finally, one we can dance to. Not that '80s sh1t you love. Let's dance. Ray Ray, why don't you ask your wife to dance? (music continues in distance) (sighs) (sighs) (music continues in distance) You need to come downstairs. Now. You want to spite me? Fine. But your brother doesn't deserve it. Are you screwing around on Daddy? Sorry about my pop. No. It's not that. Then what's the matter? At least you have a family. You know, mine disowned me after I sued the Scouts and my name was in the paper. I'm sorry. I thought it would cheer you up to come. You did? Yeah. (chuckles) (chuckles) The f*ck? I'm not gay. How do you know? I just know. You needed a Viagra to be with Patty. I didn't need it. I just took it. Did you see that? Yeah. I'm not gay. I never thought you were, Bunch. Well, then why did he kiss me? I don't know. Maybe he likes you. I'm not f*cking gay. Relax. It's just a kiss. It's not just a kiss. (snorts) It's not funny. That was... that was f*cked up. I'm sorry. And I'm f*cked up. And Stan, he's f*cked up. And, you know what, you're f*cked up, too. Because of what happened to us. Keep your f*cking voice down, huh? (blowing) (cheering) Mickey : All right. Make a wish. Why's my name spelled like that? It's 'cause they forgot your birthday, Conor. Just cut the cake, honey. Thanks. Mickey : Thank you. Con. I love you. You're a good kid. You're gonna be a good man. Abby, thank you for bringing him into this world. You do all the hard work. I'm so... lucky. 22 freaking hours, trying to push him out. (laughter) (scoffs) This is such bullshit. Mickey : Well, I'm just the grandfather, but I got something to say. (clears throat) Your father's wrong. You're not a good kid. You're a great kid. You got everything going for you. You're athletic, you're good-looking, you're smart. There's just only one thing you're missing. What, Grandpa? This. Catch. Your car? sh1t, really? Abby : He's only 14, Mick. Ray : It's all right. We'll keep it in the garage. It'll be your car in the driveway, not mine. (sighs) Turn her on. (starts engine) (music playing on radio) (exhaling) You like it? I f*cking love it. Happy birthday, son. Thank you. Mickey : Are you ready? I got everything. You have your girl where I'm sitting. You're driving... Baby, it's just a car. Sound of that motor. Oh, that's so nice. (knocking) Come in. I'm texting with Marvin. Just so you know. Yeah. What, are you drunk? A little. (laughs) Ah, f*ck. I'm gonna keep seeing him. You can't stop me. He attacked you. I had every right to take him out of the house. He’s got some dangerous friends, Bridg’. It's not your world. You can't see him anymore. That's it. I'm sorry. Didn't you ever love somebody that wasn't right for you? Yeah, I did. What happened? She's dead. Is that the woman that Grandpa killed? It's a long story. Why'd you love her? I don't know. She was sexy. Complicated. (soft laugh) I don't know. I thought she was interesting. But you know what? After she was killed, the worst thing turned out to be the best thing. Why? Because your mother came back into my life and we had you guys. So what are you saying? I'll get over him? Yeah. You will. And you think that Mom is the best thing that ever happened to you? Yeah. She is. Mom came home at 2:00 a.m. last night. ("Flashlight (Pogo's RevivalMix)" plays in distance) Abby, come on, get in here. I'm onto you. What'd you say to me? Mickey : This was the song that was playing when I first saw you. Yeah. I guess Mom couldn't dance on chemo, huh? You don't insult this beautiful lady. Get out. Get the f*ck out. It's my f*cking house! Get out! This is why we're moving to Ireland. You're not going anywhere. (music stops) And you're not selling that f*cking gym, either. What's that supposed to mean? Tell him, Ray. You can't sell that gym. That gym's got a job. What's he talking about? Nothing. Tell him, Ray. Tell him what that gym's really for. That's not a boxing gym. That's a Laundromat. That's how he cleans up all his cash. Is that true? Yeah, it's true. I built that business. I run a clean gym. (chuckles) You have any idea how much that gym makes a month, Terry? Get your head out of the f*cking clouds. You lied to me. You made me a criminal, just like you. Yeah? We telling the truth, Terry? Look, leave it, Ray. If that's what we're doing, here it is. Frances... No one would back you in Boston. You were a washed up fighter with the shakes. Frances, this... I brought you out here, got you off the booze, cleaned you up, got you a doctor, got you diagnosed. I didn't want to be f*cking diagnosed. Bought you that f*cking gym. No! You bought it for yourself. For your dirty business. Boys, boys... Yeah? We’re finished, Ray. Yeah? See how f*cking far you get without me, you piece of sh1t. (loud thumping) (grunting) This is my car! This is my f*cking car! (Daryll panting) (grunts) Want to give him this car? You like that? m*therf*cker! What are you doing, son? What the f*ck are you doing? You f*cking asshole. That was my car. Son. Party's over. Even if it's true... the things you said to him, you don't talk to this man like that. And I know what I saw that night. You're threatening me now? (panting) I need to go home now, Mickey. All right, let's go. Thanks, Grandpa. I don't want the car anymore. I'm only 14. (sniffles) (door opens) (door closes) (glass clinks) Conor wanted the family... Conor got the family. (snorts) (line ringing) Jim : Abby? Where are you? (knocking) (door opens) They're all gone, Dad. It's just you and me. What time is it? I don't know. (short laugh) You're 14. You should always know what time it is. Come here. Happy birthday, Con. (softly laughs) What are we gonna do? I can't talk now, Frances. I can't see you for a while, Mick. All right. I understand. I'm not gay. (grunts) (phone buzzing) Yeah? Ray : I want to f*ck you right now. I'm sorry, who is this? Ray Donovan. (soft chuckle) You want to f*ck me? Yeah. Come back tonight. (glass shatters) (crying) Hey. It's okay. (sniffles) It's okay. (song ends) ("Walk This Way" by Run-D.M.C. plays) (music continues in distance)
