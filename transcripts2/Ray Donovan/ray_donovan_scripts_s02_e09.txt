 Ray :  Previously on <b>Ray Donovan</b>… 
 Abby :  I think I'm in love with you. 
 Ray :  You think f*cking this guy  is gonna make you feel better. 
 But it won't. 
 It feels pretty f*cking good right now, Ray. 
 You need to stop seeing my wife. 
 That's up to her. 
 No, it's not. 
 How do you feel now? 
 Better than I've felt in a long time. 
 What did you find out about my daughter? 
 I think she's in witness protection. 
 That's a f*cking lie. 
 What else isn't true about the story you sold me? 
 You got your story. 
 My reputation is on the line! 
 It is all I have. 
 Steve :  Did you f*ck Ashley last night? 
 'Cause when I f*cked her this morning, I felt very close to you, Ray. 
 I can't see you for a while, Mick. 
 Mickey : Who's the girl, Allan? 
 I guess we both like to f*ck black chicks, Mickey. 
 Oh, I don't f*ck Claudette. 
 I make love to her. 
 (grunting, yelling) 
 Cookie : Before I went to Folsom, I gave Re-Kon the money to start his label. 
 $30,000. 
 Did you take Cookie's money or not? 
 Man, f*ck the money! 
 It's about the kid. 
 Morning, counselor. 
 Lee :  Cookie Brown has no written contract. 
 We're keeping the kid, end of story. 
 You're making a big mistake, Lee. 
 Wow. (coughs) 
 This is your moment, son. 
 You ready? 
 How about you, babe? 
 Ready to do this with me? 
 I love you, Marvin. 
 Love you, too, Shawty. 
 (gunshots) 
 (crying): Daddy? 
 (shower running) 
 (sighs) 
 (phone buzzing) 
 (trash bag crinkles) 
 (phone chimes) 
 Bridg, I know you're mad at me. 
 We can talk about it. 
 There's a lot to talk about. 
 But it's 2:00 in the f*cking morning. 
 Goddamn it, Bridg, where the f*ck are you? 
 Will you answer your f*cking phone? 
 Conor : Mom! 
 Marvin's dead. He got shot. Look. 
 Marvin and Re-Kon. 
 (ringing) 
 Abby (crying) : Ray... she's with Marvin. 
 Marvin was killed! 
 Something horrible happened. 
 She's with him, Ray! 
 I have her. 
 She's fine. 
 Oh... 
 Oh, my God. 
 (sobbing) 
 Where are you? 
 I brought her to apartment. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Bring her home. 
 Put her on the phone. 
 I need to talk to her. 
 She just fell asleep. 
 You want me to wake her up? 
 Yes. 
 Abs, she needs to rest. 
 Bring her home or I'm coming there right now. 
 Listen to me. 
 We'll be back as soon as we can. 
 You stay home with Conor. 
 She'll be okay, I promise. 
 Ray? 
 I got all the blood off. 
 Yeah. 
 Sit down, sweetheart. 
 We need to go over something. 
 You heard the shots, and then you saw Cookie walking away. 
 I didn't just hear the shots. 
 I heard his voice. 
 I know it was him. 
 Listen, Bridg. 
 This is the important part. 
 Did he see you? 
 I don't... 
 I don't know. 
 I need you to think about it, sweetheart. 
 Dad, just... I don't know. 
 I'm sorry. No more questions. 
 I’m sorry. It’s gonna be okay. 
 (crying): It's not gonna be okay. 
 It's never gonna be okay. 
 (sobbing) 
 I'm sorry. 
 Come here. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Abby? 
 Are you all right? 
 That rapper that got killed, that's Bridget's boyfriend. 
 Oh, that's awful. 
 Is she okay? 
 I don't know. 
 She's with Ray, and he won't bring her back. 
 I'm so scared. 
 Well, what can I do? 
 Will you go get her? 
 What? 
 I need you to go get her. 
 Abby, I don't think that's a good idea. 
 Why? 
 My husband has her. 
 He won't give her back. 
 You said you were all in. Are you? 
 This is different. 
 All in is all in. 
 I know you're scared. 
 That's natural. 
 But the best help I can give you is for me to look into this. 
 I'll call you back, okay? 
 (sighs) 
 What do the cops know? 
 They're still processing the scene. 
 Witnesses? 
 Not yet. 
 Steve Davis says they're canvassing the neighborhood. 
 A lot of people heard it. 
 Nobody saw it. 
 Nobody saw Bridget get out of the car? 
 Not so far. 
 All right. 
 Get over to the recording studio. 
 Find out who saw Bridget there. 
 I want to know what they know, and more importantly, what they're saying to the cops. 
 Okay, boss. 
 Do you mind? 
 Sorry. 
 You got it? 
 Yep. 
 50 bucks. 
 Let me see it. 
 The real thing is $2,500. 
 You can't tell the difference. 
 That's, uh, the one for Claudette, huh? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's elegant but simple. 
 It works as a purse, or you can wear it as a clutch, take the strap off. 
 Mickey : Yeah. 
 Something in there for you, too. 
 Mickey : Ah, it's her machine. 
 Claudette. 
 It's Mick. 
 Listen, there's something I gotta talk to you about. 
 It's urgent. 
 Call me back ASAP. 
 That'll get her. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 Hello. 
 Where the f*ck have you been? 
 Catching some rays. 
 I've been sitting in your hot-ass apartment for 20 minutes while you're out sunbathing? 
 I must have been going down when you were coming up. 
 What are you here for? 
 You need to get a f*cking job. 
 I got a job. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I called that executive lady at Paramount. 
 Oh. 
 She never got back to me. 
 Well... 
 You must've really f*cked that up, because now we're both out. 
 What the f*ck happened? 
 Well, there's other studios in town, you know. 
 Yeah... 
 Until they come through, you need a job. 
 A real job. 
 f*cking Ray, huh? 
 I see how my son… has not made a material difference in your life. 
 Let me enjoy my little… time between careers here. 
 You got a couple days. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Yeah? 
 This is Detective Tod Anderson, LAPD Homicide. 
 Is Bridget Donovan your daughter? 
 Yeah. 
 We need her to come in today. 
 Look, could we do this tomorrow morning? 
 My daughter's very upset. 
 This is an open murder investigation. 
 Two people are dead. 
 Now, she spent the day with the deceased. 
 She might have been the last person to see them alive. 
 She needs to come in and give a statement. 
 Today. 
 All right. 
 I understand. 
 Daddy, you... you don't need to protect me. 
 I want to go. 
 I want to tell them what happened. 
 I know you do, Bridg. 
 Right now, I need you to keep what you saw between us. 
 You mean keep it from mom, too? 
 It's a complicated situation. 
 No, it's not. 
 It's simple. 
 I know that Cookie killed Re-Kon and Marvin, and that's all I have to say and they'll arrest him. 
 And I'm not scared. 
 Sweetheart, it doesn't work that way. 
 You were stoned. 
 They'll tear you apart in court. 
 This is what I do for a living, Bridg. 
 These are the kinds of things I take care of. 
 I need you to trust me. 
 You understand? 
 (sniffs) 
 I think so. 
 I'm so sorry, sweetheart. 
 I was so scared. 
 I knew you were with him all day, and I thought you must have been with them when it happened. 
 What happened? 
 Where were you? 
 Um... I'm tired. 
 I'm gonna go lie down right now. 
 – I’ll go with you. 
 Bridget : – No, mom. 
 (footsteps climbing stairs) 
 What was that about? 
 She was high, Abs. 
 She got stoned with Marvin and Re-Kon. 
 She didn't want you to see her like that. 
 "See her like that"? 
 She's my f*cking daughter. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should have brought her back earlier. 
 I'll be back. 
 Where the f*ck are you going? 
 I got business. 
 Isn't she gonna have to talk to the police or something? 
 She was his girlfriend. 
 Later today. 
 In the meantime, keep her off the phone and don't let her out of the house. 
 Is she in danger? 
 No. She’s gonna be fine. 
 If she's safe, why can't she leave the house? 
 Just do what I'm asking you to do, Abs. Please. 
 Or what? 
 (door slams) 
 (door opens) 
 Bridge honey. 
 Let's talk. 
 Leave me alone. 
 I want to sleep. 
 (door closes) 
 (line ringing) 
 Claudette : Hello. 
 Hey. 
 Listen. 
 When can I see you? 
 I told you, I need some time, Mickey... after what happened. 
 What happened? 
 What was so f*cking terrible? 
 A little family disagreement. 
 You embarrassed me. 
 You told me I was invited to the party, and I wasn't. 
 I invited you. 
 And you really hurt Daryll, giving away that car. 
 All right. 
 What were you thinking? 
 All right, I made a couple mistakes. 
 But I really need to talk to you in person. 
 It's urgent. 
 Are you in trouble again? 
 Not me; you. 
 That’s all I’m gonna say on the phone. 
 Hey, Mick. 
 Guess who's coming over. 
 You're sh1tting me. 
 Don't act so surprised. 
 We got a connection… her and me. 
 She like pot? 
 She used to. 
 Come to the store with me. (giggles) 
 Good thinking. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Lee : I've been calling you since 4:00 in the morning. 
 I need you to come to the office immediately and protect me. 
 Relax, Lee. 
 I'm a walking dead man. 
 Two people are dead, Ray. 
 I'll be there later. 
 If anyone asks you, keep your f*cking mouth shut about that meeting with Cookie yesterday. 
 What do you think I am, an idiot? 
 (buzzer sounding) 
 (buzzer sounding) 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 You read my article? 
 He hasn't left his house all day. 
 Good. 
 Boss? 
 Don't do anything stupid. 
 You know what this guy's capable of. 
 I need you to go, Av. 
 (chuckles) I'm not leaving. 
 I'm not asking. 
 I need to know if he saw Bridget. 
 – Boss… 
 – Please, Av. 
 Go watch my family. 
 (Tarts engine) 
 (buzzer sounding) 
 Whoever you're looking for is somewhere else. 
 (Ray grunting) 
 (gagging) 
 Get his ass inside. 
 (grunting) 
 Is he wired up? 
 Check him. 
 (grunts) 
 (groans, gasps) 
 (groaning, panting) 
 What are you doing here, Ray Donovan? 
 You got a problem with me? 
 You killed Marvin and Re-Kon. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Everybody knows I had beef with Re-Kon, but why would I hurt the kid? 
 He was my golden goose. 
 (laughs) 
 (groans) 
 We both know why you did it. 
 (groans, sighs) 
 You out of your f*cking mind? 
 (panting) 
 You shot him in the middle of the street in f*cking Hollywood. 
 You don’t think this is gonna come back to you? 
 No.  Someone  shot him in the middle of Hollywood… but we don't know who. 
 Because nobody saw it. 
 You sure? 
 Well, that's what I hear. 
 And if someone pops up… (chuckles) well, these things take care of themselves. 
 So, why did you really come here? 
 f*ck. 
 (groans) 
 Lee wanted to make sure you're square. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Well, we ain't square. 
 The kid's gonna blow up now, and I should still have the rights to the music. 
 All right. 
 I'll talk to him. 
 And tell him I want Re-Kon's catalogue, too. 
 (unzips zipper) 
 Need a little help? 
 Hmm? 
 (chuckles) 
 I'm sorry. 
 For… for what? 
 I just haven't been with a girl in a really long time. 
 Like... like… a year? 
 Longer. 
 How long? 
 A really long time. 
 (laughs) 
 Well… 
 I think that… you're very sexy. 
 Maybe we could just go slow. 
 (chuckle) 
 You're adorable. 
 I am? 
 (laughing) 
 
 
 
 My article… what's wrong with it? 
 That guy… your unnamed source that helped the FBI catch Sully... it's Mickey Donovan, right? 
 Sully and Mickey were the biggest enemies in the freaking world. 
 The FBI told me that Sully trusted Mickey. 
 Trusted him? 
 Okay, last robbery those two did together ended with Mickey stealing a half million from Sully and giving it to some f*cking moolie he had a kid with. 
 Plus, he ratted out Sully's whole family. 
 All his brothers... they all died inside. 
 The FBI said that Mickey offered to get Sully out of the country as a part of their sting. 
 Listen to me, I'm telling you... only reason Sully goes to L.A. is to plug that asshole. 
 You're being played. 
 By Mickey and the FBI. 
 (exhales) 
 Why? 
 Uh, how the f*ck do I know? 
 I just know you're being played. 
 (door opens) 
 Abby : Bridg. 
 Are you hungry at all? 
 No. 
 I know it's so hard, sweetheart. 
 (sniffling) 
 Losing someone like this is the worst thing. 
 It's a horrible world sometimes. 
 (crying): You don't know what you're talking about. 
 That's not what's wrong. 
 What is, honey? 
 (sniffles) 
 Leave me the f*ck alone. 
 Honey, look at me. 
 (whimpering) 
 Bridg... (sniffles) 
 I was in the car. 
 I saw him shot. 
 His head exploded. 
 What? 
 His head exploded, and some of his blood got into my mouth. 
 I tried to wash it out. 
 It tastes like rust. 
 I saw Cookie Brown shoot Re-Kon. 
 And Marvin begged for his life and he shot him right in front of me. 
 Sweetheart, why didn't you tell me? 
 Daddy told me I couldn't tell anybody, but I have to. 
 I need to say what I saw. 
 (phone ringing) 
 sh1t. 
 You m*therf*cker. 
 You had our daughter lie to me? 
 Yes. To protect her. 
 I should f*cking kill you! 
 Listen to me, Abby. 
 Bridget didn't see everything. 
 She heard his voice, and she saw him walk away. 
 Any lawyer is gonna rip her testimony apart. 
 I don't care. She should go to the police. 
 She should tell them what she saw. 
 You don't understand how dangerous this guy is. 
 He already killed one kid. 
 How do you know he didn't see her himself, huh?! 
 How do you know her life isn't already in danger?! 
 If he'd have seen her, he'd have shot her right there. 
 Oh, Jesus, Ray! 
 That's the truth, Abby. 
 Please just wait for me to get home. 
 You have to trust me. I know this guy. 
 You know him? 
 Yeah, I know him through Lee. 
 So this is about your dirty business. 
 No, it isn't. Ab... 
 f*ck. 
 Thank God you’re here. He’s gonna kill me. 
 (groaning) 
 I'm gonna f*cking kill you myself, you piece of sh1t. 
 Two people are dead because of you! 
 Raymond, calm down! 
 You want this to go away, you got to give Marvin and Re-Kon's music. 
 All of it. 
 Okay, I get it. Done. 
 Absolutely not. 
 He'll kill me! 
 We're the trustees of their estates. 
 Those rights are ours. 
 We're not giving them up. 
 I wouldn't even consider it. 
 Go after him, Ray! 
 Raymond, why do we have to give up these assets to a murderer? 
 We got to honor the deal. 
 What deal? 
 You need to trust me, Ezra, please. 
 Trust you? You should've come to me two days ago. 
 You didn't consult me on this. 
 I was trying to protect you. 
 I don’t like the way you’ve treated me for weeks. 
 We don't have time for this, Ezra. 
 You disrespected Ruth, you disrespected the RGOCC, and you didn't handle June Wilson. 
 Bridget was in the backseat of that car. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That  shayna-maidele  had to suffer through something so terrible? 
 We need to give him what he wants. 
 It's the only way to be done with him. 
 Done, Raymond. 
 (sizzling) 
 Hey, Uncle Bunchy. 
 Burgers! 
 There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Like this. 
 I thought you didn't like mustard. 
 (grunts) 
 You want to try it the Boston way? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 You got to put the tomato and the pickles underneath the burger. 
 Really? 
 Oh, he doesn't like pickles. 
 Yes, I do. 
 (Patty chuckles) 
 Bunchy, do you, uh... do you cut yours in-in half in Boston or...? 
 Oh, absolutely. 
 (clears throat) 
 Want me to cut that for you, buddy? 
 Good, huh? (chuckles) 
 Shorty : Hey, man. 
 First-timer. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Well, do you know what kind you want? 
 What kind? 
 I want pot. 
 Well, we offer two basic types. 
 Indica and sativa. 
 Which one, uh, puts a lady in the mood? 
 (laughs) 
 Try the indica. 
 It's more of a body high. 
 That's the one. 
 Give me 50 bucks of that. 
 Okay. 
 Show him the Skywalker, too. 
 Okay. 
 Look at it. 
 See what I'm saying? 
 We could knock this place off real easy. 
 (line ringing) 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah, Av? 
 Boss, someone's here. 
 It's that cop. 
 Abby's friend. 
 (splashing) 
 You're really good with him, Bunchy. 
 He really likes you. 
 I like him, too. 
 Clifford : All right, I'm ready to get out! 
 Just a minute. 
 I can finish the dishes. 
 You sure? 
 Uncle Bunchy! 
 I want Uncle Bunchy to get me out! 
 (chuckles) 
 D-Do you... do you mind? 
 Sure. 
 Um, come on. 
 Out you go. 
 No, you got to lift me. 
 Ow! 
 Bunchy threw me. 
 Cliff, honey, don't say that. 
 What happened? 
 You all right? 
 (sighs) 
 Who's he? 
 I'm Detective Jim Halloran. 
 I'm a friend of your mother's. 
 My mother has no friends. 
 Bridg, honey, let's sit down. 
 You need to listen to him. 
 Your mom asked me to talk to you about what happened last night. 
 I understand you were in the car when your friend was killed. 
 (scoffs) You told him? 
 I had to. 
 Does Daddy know he's here? 
 Look, Bridget, I'm gonna keep this between us. 
 But the best thing you can do when you give your statement today is to tell them exactly what you saw, okay? 
 We need you to help us catch this guy, and we have a very small window. 
 (door opens) 
 Hi, Daddy. 
 Bridget, go get your stuff. 
 It's time to go. 
 Get the f*ck out of my house. 
 I'll talk to you later. 
 Call me if you need me. 
 (door closes) 
 Ray, I... 
 Did you know mommy’s boyfriend is a cop? 
 Bridg, you got to listen to me. 
 You're gonna say Re-Kon and Marvin were smoking pot in the car. 
 They almost had an accident. 
 You got scared, told them to let you out. 
 The car stopped at Sunset and La Brea, and that's when you got out. 
 If I tell that bullshit story, he'll get away with murder. 
 And you'll be safe, and that's all I care about. 
 Sweetheart, I know you're mad at me. 
 I know you're mad at your mom. 
 But if you name Cookie Brown, they'll arrest him. 
 Good! 
 And he'll do everything in his power to stop you from testifying. 
 I know that. 
 I don't care. 
 He killed Marvin. 
 You know, the following facts are true. 
 Metal cannot liquefy at any temperature below 3,000 degrees. 
 There were no photos of the Pentagon taken the morning before the hijackings, and the debris field of Flight 93 is inconsistent with any non-combat plane crash. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 This is an all-cash business. 
 They don't even f*cking take credit cards. 
 What the hell you think I've been talking about, Mick? 
 (chuckles) 
 Bridget, look at me. 
 He's a very dangerous person, and there's only so much I can do to protect you. 
 You understand? 
 Hang back. 
 (sniffs) 
 Hi. 
 How are you? 
 It's hot. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I did security back in the day. 
 Hard job. 
 Underappreciated. 
 They probably have you sleep here, am I right? 
 On a cot in the back? 
 Enough talk. 
 Yeah, back to work. 
 So what do you think? 
 Slam dunk? 
 Far from it. 
 They got security up the ass, and that guard is packing. 
 Eh, we'll figure something out. 
 (laughs) 
 He-He's fine. 
 Bunchy? 
 I'm so sorry I did that. 
 You didn't do anything. 
 It was... It was an accident. 
 I'm not his father. 
 I shouldn't be giving him a f*cking bath. 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know. 
 I just get really... confused. 
 A-A-About what? 
 Were you ever... afraid that you were gonna do something? 
 But you knew in your heart that you didn't really want to do it? 
 Um, what... what-what are you talking about? 
 I can't tell you. 
 Bunchy, uh, you're s-scaring me. 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 Please leave. 
 Clifford : Mom? 
 Cliff, honey... stay in your room. 
 Please go. 
 Detective Todd Anderson. 
 I'm Ray Donovan. 
 I know who you are. 
 Bridget? 
 Yeah? 
 Thank you for coming down. 
 Now, this won't take long. 
 I just need to ask you some questions about where you were yesterday and last night. 
 You ready? 
 I guess. 
 That's good enough for me. 
 Let's go. 
 I'll make this go as smoothly as possible. 
 Uh, Mr. Donovan? 
 I should've told you on the phone... 
 I have to talk to her alone. 
 She's a minor. 
 It's just an interview, and that's how we conduct them. 
 Is there a problem? 
 I'm fine, Daddy. 
 Where is she? 
 They're already in there. 
 They want to talk to her alone. 
 You had the man you're f*cking tell our daughter what to do when her life is at stake. 
 Un-fucking-believable. 
 I'm not saying sorry. 
 f*ck you! 
 Keep your f*cking voice down. 
 We finished recording the song. 
 It was pretty late, and, uh, Re-Kon said that it was time to go home. 
 They were gonna drop me off. 
 So, you got in the car with Re-Kon and Marvin? 
 Yes. 
 And then what happened? 
 We were driving. 
 Uh, we were... we were smoking pot. 
 Bridget, I need to ask you an important question. 
 Were you in the car when they were killed? 
 No. 
 You're sure? 
 Yes. 
 I got out at Sunset and La Brea. 
 They left me there. 
 Then I walked for a while, and I called my dad, and he picked me up. 
 You know how much trouble you could be in for lying? 
 I'm not lying. 
 So, you just happened to get out of the car two blocks before these people were murdered? 
 You see why that's hard for me to believe? 
 Did your father tell you to lie? 
 No. 
 Look, I know you're scared. 
 I'm not scared. 
 You're sure you weren't in the car when they were shot? 
 Yes. I got out because Re-Kon was really high, and I didn't like the way he was driving. 
 Can I go now? 
 Look, I know your father's looking out for you. 
 But who's looking out for Marvin? 
 Claudette. 
 How was your drive? 
 It was fine, Mickey. 
 Come on in. 
 (clears throat) 
 This is just, uh... this is temporary. 
 Yeah. 
 (quietly): Yeah. 
 I got you something. 
 What's this? 
 That's a gift. 
 (chuckles) 
 Open it. 
 Pot? 
 Don't worry... it's indica. 
 You said this was urgent. 
 Yeah, uh... 
 Yeah. Have a seat. 
 It's about Allan. 
 Allan? 
 He's f*cking around on you. 
 What? 
 I saw him at a party last night. 
 He was with another Woman. 
 That's what you called me for? 
 That's what this is about? 
 I thought you would want to know. 
 Allan and I are... working on our marriage. 
 Well, you wouldn't have to work on it if you were married to me! 
 You were supposed to wait for me. 
 20 years? 
 I stole that money for you. 
 Gave you a life. 
 What'd you do? 
 You married that piece of sh1t! 
 Mickey! 
 I haven’t exactly been an angel in all of this. 
 Allan and I, we have our ups and downs, but we have a good life. 
 Yeah. You got a great setup out there. 
 I got to give you that. 
 All I ever wanted... was for you to be happy. 
 Bullshit. 
 The only one you ever cared about was yourself. 
 Keep the bag. 
 I got the real one at home. 
 (door opens) 
 Bridg? 
 I want to go home now. 
 What did you tell them? 
 I told them the truth. 
 I didn't see anything. 
 Snowflake! 
 I'm so sorry about what happened. 
 I love the little nigga, too. 
 He had everything in front of him. 
 She's had a long day, Cookie. 
 We need to go. 
 Understood. 
 It's gonna hurt for a while. 
 It's gonna get better. 
 Bridg? 
 Let's go, sweetheart. 
 Strong girl. 
 You talk to Lee yet? 
 You're gonna get everything you want. 
 Good. Glad he came around. 
 Was that him? 
 (car engine starts) 
 (moaning, muttering in Russian) 
 He wants me to do him any time I can. 
 That's our girl. 
 Here you go, doll. 
 You know what, Mick? 
 We can do this. 
 You want to f*ck my wife? 
 f*ck her. 
 But if you do anything to put my daughter's life in danger, I'll f*cking kill you. 
 That guy could've been in cuffs right now. 
 And you turned your daughter into a liar. 
 Woman : Hey, Jim, you all right? 
 It's okay. It's cool. 
 Mama, I'm so sad. 
 I'm gonna miss him. 
 There. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Yeah? 
 You ruined my f*cking life, Ray. 
 Kate... 
 I really liked you. 
 I trusted you. 
 Ray. 
 Hi. 
 Steve : Is that Ray? 
 What do you think, Ray? 
 One of us might have to stop f*cking her. 
 What's wrong, Ray? 
 Come in. 
 Tell me about your day.
