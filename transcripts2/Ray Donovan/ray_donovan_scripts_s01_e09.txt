 Ray? 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Hey! 
 Why's he talking to my father? 
 (shouts) God! 
 You better f*cking find out, or I'll tell your wife about that kid you support in Riverside. 
 What do you got? 
 Murder. 
 Involving Sean Walker. 
 Frank : Van Miller's off the reservation. 
 There's nothing I can do about him now. 
 Ray :  Wait in your office. 
 I'm sending something over now. Now touch your nose. And I got an idea for a movie you should do. It's about an unknown actor and he ends up shooting a young woman in the head. Then he frames a working Joe from an honest family for the murder. If I buy this story, I own it. You cannot share this with anyone. I'm wiring you up. You're gonna get in there and get a confession out of Sean Walker. Or you're going back to Walpole. There's witnesses here. Your children. Terry : Whoa, whoa, Ray, Ray, Ray! It wasn't his fault! It just got out of hand! Where you going now? Boston. Why the f*ck are you going to Boston? I'm here to see Sully. What are you doing here, Ray? I want you to kill my father. (sighs) I thought my family was f*cking screwed up. ♪ Ray Donovan 1x09 ♪ Road Trip Original Air Date on August 25, 2013 (wind whistling softly) (exhales) (inhales sharply) Uh, we need to stop. Sully has to pee. Shut the f*ck up. You need to go. You're bouncing your leg. He's got a bladder problem. Shut the f*ck up. We stopped a half hour ago. Yeah. Well, tough sh1t. Pull over. If we keep stopping, it's going to take us two weeks to get there. We've got nothing but time, pal. (turn signal clicking) (crickets chirping) (sighs) What's up, Con? (chuckles softly) What's the matter? You're not talking to me? The Kids' Choice Awards are tonight. Tomorrow night. Whatever. It is? Yeah, I told you two weeks ago. You said you'd arrange it so I could go with Tommy, and you didn't. He's nominated. It's for kids though. You really want to go to that thing? Yeah. I do. Look, I know you think he's perv. He's not. He likes trannies. And girls when he's drunk. You seem to know him pretty well. He's my friend. He's never done anything to me. And if he did, I know how to take care of myself. All right. I'll talk to Tommy. Bullshit. Hey! I'll call him in the morning. (urine sloshing) It's cold as sh1t out here. I thought the desert was supposed to be hot. Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap. Just saying. What, now you're the f*cking weather girl? (phone ringing) Yes, Ray? Why are you stopped? Because every five minutes, one of them has to take a piss. And now the dog... I don't give a sh1t. I don't care if you got to put f*cking diapers on 'em. You get 'em to L.A. today. You hear me, Avi? Okay. Let's go. Where are we? New Mexico. Looks like f*cking Mars. Everything off the jab. You're gonna get killed inside here. And then move out. Move out. Hey! The flyers are here. Flyers are here. (chuckles) Aw, cool. Terry : Daryll "Black Irish" Donovan? Yeah. He's black and he's Irish. (laughs): What do you want? Hey. Here. Uh, your mother coming? Yeah, she said she was. Good. She bringing that Yid husband? Daryll : God, I hope not. f*cking dickhead. Can I help you? Mickey, we need to talk. Right now. Looks like you got a new fighter, Ter. I think he wants to glove up. You want to do this out here? What's going on? This doesn't concern you. Hey, this is my place. Everything here concerns me. Who the f*ck are you? I cannot disclose that information, and I need to talk to your father right now. Oh... (chuckles): Who is this guy? You want me to throw him out? Yeah. Don't touch me! Mickey : Relax. I'm just f*cking around with you. Over here. Who's that? I don't know. Maybe his parole officer. Don't worry about it, Bunch. (quietly): Don't you ever talk to me like that in front of my kids. I will talk to you any way I damn please. Oh, yeah? I want you... to call Sean Walker right now and set up a meeting to see him today. How we gonna get his number? Stop with the crap. You just saw him last week. Yeah. I know all about your overall deal, Mick. Well, maybe I don't want to compromise my future as a screenwriter. (laughing) You find that amusing? Yeah. You actually think he's gonna make your movie? Oh, he's gonna make that f*cking movie. He's stringing you along to keep you quiet. Christ. How f*cking stupid can you get? Call him. Bunchy : Hey, Pop. Where you going? I told you guys I was in the movie business. I got a meeting on the lot. Shut your mouth. Let's go. Why are you avoiding me, Frank? Jesus. What the f*ck are you doing? I was in the neighborhood. How the hell did you even get in here? Did anybody see you? You're worrying about the wrong things, Frank. I gave you the ammunition. You got photos of Van Miller tripping his balls off, hair samples, video. What the f*ck are you waiting for? You act like it's so f*cking simple. Like I can just walk down there and throw this sh1t on a desk. Today. Did you take your heart medicine? Woman : No, no, Avi, I don't have it. So send Joey to the CVS. Oh, not today. Yes, today. That's right. The blood thinner. Okay. Okay, I got to go. (speaks Hebrew) Me, too. Bye-bye. Your mother? I'm usually there on Fridays. Mm. Shabbat. Only thing I'm gonna miss is my mother. She's 92 and can still kick my ass at  Jeopardy. She keeps those nurses on their toes, let me tell you. They got no idea what they're in for without me there to protect 'em. (chuckles) How old is yours? 85. She's starting to lose it, man. She sideswiped three cars in the last month. (laughs) I had to take her keys away. God bless 'em. Sully is the FBI's most wanted, but all his mother has to do is snap her fingers, and he jumps. Shut the f*ck up, you c**t. You should've stayed behind to take care of her. Man :  That .38's a beauty. That has a bodyguard on it so it won't snag your pants. (phone ringing) sh1t. Hey, Conor. Dad, are you really gonna get me in the awards with Tommy? Yeah. 'Cause Jimmy wants to go see the new Batman movie tonight. I'm working on it right now. Tell your mom to buy you a suit and take you over to Amelio's. What about school? You're skipping school today. (chuckles softly) I'll take the, uh, .38 and the nine. Okay. You know, uh... I got my kid a little tux for his first communion. I wept like a baby. Kills you, huh? f*ckin' kids. It was good to see you again, Ray. Always a pleasure doing business with you. Yeah. (sighs) (dialing) (cell phone ringing) Hello, Ray. Yeah. That children awards thing tonight? You're taking Conor. I can't go, Ray. Why not? Because Marty Grossman is going to publish photos of me. What photos? Of me and my wife. (sniffles) She left me, Ray. What wife? When did you get married? Chloe. (sniffles) Two nights ago in Vegas. Jesus, Tommy. That's a man. Technically... yes. But I don't care what the law says. The pastor pronounced her my wife. All right, you listen to me. My kid's going to that awards thing tonight, and you're taking him. I want you to text me where you are and meet me outside in 15 minutes. And, Tommy, do not make me come inside and look for you. (man speaking in French) (digital camera beeping) (man and woman chattering in French) (man laughs) (man shouting in French) Come on, Tommy. Let's go. What the f*ck is on your head? My heart is broken. How can you ask me that? (car door opens, closes) Come on, get him! I f*cked it up, Ray. I'm so sorry, man. I f*ck up everything. (sighs) Maybe I should just kill myself. Kill yourself tomorrow. Tonight you're going to this awards thing, and you're taking my kid. Where are we going? (sighs) We got to go see Marty. He already called me for comment. I told him that we were in love. (sighs) When Marty Grossman calls you for a comment, he doesn't want a comment, you idiot. He wants money. Did you know that only one celebrity has been convicted of a felony in over 20 years? O.J., Robert Blake, the list goes on and on. They flash their smiles, and the jury gets blinded. Just the way you were. Go f*ck yourself. These people. (scoffs) These people live... without consequences. Yeah, whatever. Sean Walker. Did you know that he blinks every time he pulls the trigger in one of his movies? That's a fact that's interesting to you? You're still such a fan, Mickey? I'll make sure you have a DVD player in your cell so you can watch all your favorite Sean Walker movies. I know what I'm going in there to do. Let's do it. (recorder clicks) Oh, let's check these levels. f*ck you, one, two, three. f*ck you, one, two, three. f*ck you, one, two, three. Excuse me. I think you're very beautiful. Would you mind if I took your picture? Uh, hi. I'm her mother. Oh, well, then that's where she gets it. Gets what? Forgive me. I'm-I'm Avon Loma. The photographer? Sorry, you've probably never heard of me. Um, I was just admiring your daughter's bone structure. Oh. (laughs) Oh, thank you. Look, um, we are so far behind. Jaguar would probably kill me for even being here, but can I give you my card? You see, I'm-I'm prepping a spot for Levi's, and I'd love to show your stuff to the client. Really? Yeah. Do you think you guys could possibly come in around... 5:00? I could take some test photos then. Mom, please? Okay. All right, I'll see you then. Nice to meet you. (whispers) (laughs) Stay in the car. Marty. Ray. You're not getting a dime out of Tommy Wheeler. Kill the photos, kill the story. No f*ckin' way, Ray. Tommy's in a tuxedo, the he-she's wearing a full bridal gown. (laughing) Un-fucking-believable. Ray : We had a deal. I gave you Sean Walker's baby less than a year ago. Yeah, what kind of story is that? He got the egg from his assistant? Big f*cking deal. Big f*cking deal. And I killed all the Sean Walker Scientology rumors, so we're even. I'm not scared of you anymore. You should be. f*ck you. I'm tired of you M*therf*ckers threatening me for the past ten years. I'm not threatening you, Marty. Very funny. Very funny. I've got protection now. I do whatever the f*ck I want. I'm gonna time it exactly. It's gonna be great when Tommy's up there accepting his award, and all those cell phones start beeping. All right. (chuckles) (women laughing) So I'm getting pulled over. Yeah? There's a 30-foot cloud of smoke billowing from the back of my car. What? I open the door, fall flat on my face, and scream at the top of my lungs, "It's okay, Officer! I just had my parking brake on!" (laughter) And then what happened? My stand-in just had to do some community service. (laughs) You have beautiful eyes. (sniffles) Goddamn it. (women laughing) Oh, my God! What? Woman : What the f*ck?! Are you okay? What'd you just do? Woman : Oh, my God! (laughs) What happened? He just-- he put his pen1s in my hand! He put his f*cking pen1s in my hand! Get in the f*cking car. Now! Okay. Oh, my God. I'm sorry about that. Can I talk to you for a second? Excuse me. You know who he is, right? Yes. Listen, Tommy's having a real hard time right now. I need you to help me out here and not tell anyone else about this. Can you do that? Maybe. Abby : Look at you. My handsome little man. It's pretty good, right? You want cuffs on your trouser? Mom? I don't know. Let's ask your dad. (camera clicks) All right. (clears throat) It's a bar mitzvah? No. Kids' Choice Awards tonight. A guest of Tommy Wheeler. (phone chimes) (phone ringing) Abby : Hi. Is this awards show for real? If it's not gonna happen, I'd rather tell him now. Don't worry. It's gonna happen. Tell Conor he looks great. He says you look real handsome, honey. Should Conor have cuffs? Absolutely not. (laughs): Okay. No cuffs. What the f*ck, man?! Sober the f*ck up. (sighs) Where's your f*cking shirt, by the way? I don't know, man. You know how many drugs I did last night? I don't want to know. (sighs): Oh! There are three rules for making a Sean Walker film. I had no idea. One: I always walk towards danger. Two: I overcome odds not with muscle, but because I care. And three: people feel great when it's over. When they leave that theater, they want to fight for what's right. 
 
 (sighs) What? Was it right for a son to frame his father for murder? Rebecca, could you please leave the room? Thank you. Mickey, you got to be careful here. This movie that we are making is fiction. No one is really guilty for that night. Accidents happen. Accidents? You blew her f*cking brains out. You ever think about that? No. I've worked all that out. In a certain point in one's spiritual development, you process things, and you move on. And I've named a charity after her, for victims of genital mutilation in the Sudan. Colleen's Children. Yeah. All right, thank you, Suki. It's all set. Conor is my guest for tonight. Good. Are we good, Doc? As a medical professional, I have to tell you, this man needs treatment. He needs detox. Here. Thank you. Jesus, what the f*ck is that? That's the niacin. (laughs): Oh. Oh, God. I'm getting a hard-on, Ray. (sighs): Oh. (laughs) Can you turn the AC on? It is on. He's telling the truth. Menopause. Catherine : I don't feel so good. Baby's getting sick. It's this car. I need a rest. Couldn't we just get a room for a bit? We are not stopping. Catherine : Oh, no! What the f*ck is the matter now? Oh, he's hypersalivating! He's hypersalivating! He can't take the heat! Poor Baby's so hot! This ain't gonna stop. Oh! If we just stick her in a motel for a couple hours, we'll be fine. Catherine : It's gonna be okay. Oh, my God, I'm dying. I'm dying! Hey, you need something, boss? What do we got on Marty Grossman? Oh, not much. He just beefed up his security. I know. Derek de la Fontaine. What about this Chip guy? I think it's his boyfriend. Tommy : Ray? Marty texted me again. He asked for another comment. m*therf*cker. Ray, I've been thinking. Maybe I should just pay him. I need my career, man. I'm an actor. I have to act. And my agent's just sent me a great script, but the whole thing will fall through if we don't make a deal. I ordered a check for two million dollars. Good. Good. That's good, Tommy. (sniffles) (voice breaking): I still remember her looking up at me. Before you pulled the trigger? Yeah. Mickey : How did it feel? Sean : Feel? It was the worst moment of my life. I saw this little hole in her head. She was looking at me. And then it just started to pulse blood. It was just... pulsing and pulsing and pulsing. (sobbing) (sniffles) Special effects will take care of that. But this isn't about my story. It's about yours. (line ringing) (cell phone ringing) (whispers): Aw, sh1t. Hello. Catherine : Let us in. Avi : We had to stop for the dog. Are you f*cking kidding me? The shower isn't working! Ah, Jesus. (sighs): Oh. Wait, you stopped at a motel? They're out of their f*cking minds, Ray. He's a f*cking fugitive, Avi. If someone calls in a tip, you're gonna have the feds up your ass so fast, you won't even see it coming. This is f*cking amateur hour. Really? You want to fly down here and take over, Ray? 'Cause I would love that! All right. You listen to me, Avi. Unless you want to get arrested or shot in the f*cking head by a SWAT team, you get them back tonight. (grunts) Tommy : Your back must get sore sitting in that computer chair all day. Want me to rub it? I'm gay, Tommy. But what the hell. Yeah? Mmm, yeah. What are you doing later? (sighs): Aw, Tommy. You're married to a tranny. We split up. Besides, we never judged each other like that. Aren't you gay? I don't know. Love sucks. Mm, tell me about it. (shivers) God, it's cold in here. Yeah? Mm. That's a good sign. That means the drugs are bringing you down. Here. Put this on. (phone ringing) What's up, Terry? Have you seen the old man? No. Why? Lena : Hi. Oh, good, I'm glad... glad you could make it. Um, we can just go right over here. Thank you. Oh. All right. When was the last time you saw him? I don't know. What's up? He left with some weird guy today. Seemed to have Mickey under his thumb. What'd he look like? Uh, he had a moustache. Mickey said they were going to Hollywood, but this guy looked more like an insurance salesman. Is he in trouble? How should I know? I'm asking you, Raymond. I'm telling you, Terry. Stay out of it. (sighs) (line ringing) (sighs) Rebecca : Mass Appeal Productions. Sean Walker, please. He's in a meeting. Can I take a message? Tell him it's Ray Donovan. Oh, hey, Ray. That's funny. He's in with a Mr. Donovan right now. Tara, I'd love to have you right up against that brick wall. All right, Mom. Oh. Yeah. Oh, come on. Get in here. Okay. All right? All right, big smile, ladies. (camera clicking) (phone chimes) (phone ringing) Hello. What the f*ck are you doing about Van Miller, Frank? Ray, listen to me. I've been thinking about it. If I turn Van in to the ASAC, it's gonna shine a bright light right up my ass. And that means yours, too. I don't give a sh1t, Frank. I'm sending you a file now. Open it. (computer chimes) You see that? Handle it by the end of the day, or I bring your wife in here and introduce her to your other family. Ray, please don't do this. (phone beeps) (sighs) What are you doing out here? I told you to wait in the room or in the car. Hey, relax, junior. I've been doing this for 20 yes. You don't think I know how to keep my head down? What do we got? Hmm. We'll eat, we'll piss, and we'll go. Okay, I love you. Don't worry about me. I'll be in touch when I can. Bye. Bye. Come on. We'll eat, we'll go. Were you on the phone? I knocked it off. Oh. Who were you on the phone with? Sully, they're old. (scoffs) You got to say good-bye to your ma. It's only fair. All these years, I've hardly seen them. It would kill them if I didn't say good-bye. Did you tell 'em where we're going? No. No, I would never do anything like that. Come on. It's me. What did you say? I-I might've said California. Well, that's not so bad. (chuckles) Okay! (laughs) Uh, you got the dog? Did he make? Yeah, he's in the car. Hey, where's the leash? I packed it. 'Cause we're gonna need it. I had to chase the dog all over the f*cking parking lot... (chuckles) ...while you were talking on the phone. I just thought... Sully... Come on. Don't. (gagging) I always hated your f*cking mother! (gagging) I'm too old for this sh1t! You're gonna give me a hernia! (both exhale) (panting) (sighs) (groans) ♪ ♪ (groans) All right, time to go. Hey. She ain't coming. Had a change of heart. (sighs) (engine starts) (engine stops) (door alarm beeping) (sighs) f*ck! (phone ringing) Yeah? We have a real problem. What now? Ray, he f*cking murdered her! The woman. The girlfriend? Catherine? Yes. Now what do I do? Did anyone see her check in? No, no, I checked them in myself. She went straight to the room. Nobody saw. Good. Then get her the f*ck out of there. Do what you got to do. Get back to L.A. Nothing's changed. (grunting) (grunting continues in distance) (jazz music playing) (panting) We follow the innocent Boston man as he enters the prison yard. Like I wrote it. Yes. But just as he's about to lower his head and cry, we hear the sounds of a helicopter up above. (mimics helicopter) He looks up... he sees the movie star at the controls. Me. It hovers down. Wow. (mimics helicopter) He reaches his hand out. Close-up... hand holding hand. Credits roll. f*ck! You like it? I love it. I think it really works. This movie is gonna be f*cking huge! It's gonna be f*cking huge! Amen, m*therf*cker! Amen, m*therf*cker! (both laugh) Hey! Tommy : So we just pay 'em off and then we're out of here, right? Ray : Uh-huh. Tommy : Okay, good. Little dude? He's a good kid, Ray. I know you're worried he's gay. What the f*ck are you talking about? Well, he's not. We talk. He's got a girlfriend. Yeah? (chuckles) Hey, Ray... if we're just paying this guy off, what are we doing in the basement of the parking structure? ♪ ♪ Holy sh1t! (elevator bell dings) What the f*ck? I want to pay him, Ray. I don't know what that was for, Ray, but... Ray, Ray, I don't think we should do anything... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (yells) (groaning) God! Oh, my God! Holy... You f*cking psychopath! You ever go back on a deal with me again, I'll f*cking kill you. (Chip sobbing) Wow, Ray... wow. (humming) You're really enjoying yourself. (chuckles): Well, Mickey, I know everyone must look like a hedonist to you, but the fact is, hey... I'm just doing my job. (chuckles) What's the beer for? Well... there is... nothing wrong with celebrating a victory. I guess I can't argue with that. (sighs) Frosty. Sean : Mickey, you got to be careful here. This movie that we are making is-is fiction. (laughs) No one is really guilty for that night. Accidents happen. Mickey : Accidents? You blew her f*cking brains out. You ever think about that? Sean (quietly) : No. I've worked all that out. (crowd cheering, cameras clicking) ♪ ♪ Thanks, Ray. I had a great day. You take care of Conor tonight. Of course. That means not sharing any of that sick sh1t you got running around in your head. Yeah. Hey, little dude, you look slamming. Hey. (mimics explosion) Hi, Mrs. Donovan. Abby. You look sharp. Thanks. You'll never believe how f*cked up I was this morning. Got to hand it to Ray. We good now? You okay? Yeah, Dad. Thanks. Anything else on your mind? I'm still mad you hit Grandpa. (sighs) You really like him, don't you? Yeah, he's fun. He talks to me. All right. All right. You have fun tonight. I love you, Con. See you, Dad. All right, get out of here. Ready? Let's go. All right. See you. (crowd shouting, cheering) He stinks of booze, and he's wearing a woman's shirt. Yeah. He'll be fine. Thank you. I'll see you at home? Yeah. I got something I got to take care of. All right. See you later. See you. (phone ringing) Ray? Yeah, Frank? I'm doing it now. (phone chimes) Hey, you guys? Hi. So, I just got word from the New York office, and they think you have a lot of potential, but I'm afraid they already found someone. All right. Well, we had to wait five hours for that? I'm sorry. I am. But I am gonna keep your pictures on file, okay? (sighs) (quietly): It's all right. Let's just... let's just go. (Avi sighs) What the hell is this? His name is Baby. I thought you might want him. No. No way. I hate poodles Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do with him? Uh... All right. Give it. Hey, uh, Tara? Want a dog? Mom, please? (knocking) I said to myself on the drive, (chuckles) if L.A. looks like this, I'll f*cking kill myself, but now that I'm here, it's nice. I got you a car. I got transportation covered. Thanks. It's safer if you drive yourself. (chuckles) Listen, Sully, if you need a gun or a car in this town, I'm the guy you want to get it for you. Hey, Ray, just 'cause we got a deal doesn't mean I'm your f*cking employee. Cheers. Our deal was you came alone. Took care of that, didn't I? (sighs) Now, I'm doing this thing my way, using my tools. (chuckles) Come on. Fine. But I say when. (sighs) Okay. And another thing: you take care of him afterwards. I don't want anyone from my family finding him. So I'm thinking maybe Mickey just went on a long trip, forgot to leave a forwarding address. Now, when do I get the rest of my money, my passports, and my ticket out of here? When the job is done. What's the matter, Raymond? You don't trust me? Van : I've got it all worked out. I even already know the judge, prosecutor that I want. And they think they can put Ray away for life? Well, I haven't spoken to them about it yet, but yes, I'm sure they can. Both are known for their punitive flourishes. Especially with people like him. So what does your boss think? You think I trust that guy? (chuckles) Mickey, there's a reason Ray has eluded us all these years. Let me get this straight. No one else knows about this? (laughs) I couldn't risk it. And you get all the credit. (laughs) (sighs) At the Bureau, lazy people are always sticking their names on good work. Not this time. Who's got the stick now? Hmm? Who's got the stick now?
