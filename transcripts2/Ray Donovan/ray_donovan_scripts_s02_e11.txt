 Previously on  Ray Donovan... 
 Mickey : This is an all-cash business. 
 We could knock this place off real easy. 
 They got security up the ass, and that guard is packing. 
 Cherry :  He wants me to do him  anytime I can. 
 Let's say I needed to turn this off. 
 What would that be worth to you? 
 What if I wanted more than $5,000? 
 Let's just go to Ireland now. 
 I saved about $40,000. 
 I'm not taking your money. 
 You're not a criminal. You don't have the stomach for it. 
 I got nothing left. 
 Terry! This is my son. 
 He's gonna be our muscle. 
 You shot him in the middle of the street in f*cking Hollywood. 
 You don't think this is gonna come back to you? 
 Someone shot him in the middle of Hollywood, but we don't know who. 
 Because nobody saw it. 
 Marvin. 
 Conor :  You know who did it? 
  Yeah. And Daddy made me lie to the police. I need you to get rid of Cookie Brown. Arrest him or hurt him. Hurt him? He's gonna kill my f*cking daughter! Mr. Brown is our new client. Cookie : I hear somebody might be shopping a video of whoever killed 'Lil Homie. I'll pay whatever they want. Footage like that would be worth millions. Find it. I'm gonna bring down the president's appointee  for the head of the FBI. She has to go, Ray. You come after her or me, this goes viral. Cochran :  You let that f*ck  record our f*cking private time together? You're f*cking finished. Tommy? You want to tell me why you paid $2 million to have Sully kill your father? You don't quit, do you? Kate :  Did he f*ck you up  like he f*cked up your brother? (gasps) (crying) Why are you still worried about this woman? She prints what she knows, we all go to prison. Let's do this. (crowd cheering) Yes, yes. How y'all beautiful ladies doing this afternoon? Hey, yo, Cook. Beautiful ladies. Man : Mr. Brown, over here! (crowd cheering) (cell phone vibrating) Yeah. He just arrived for the service. Don't let him out of your sight, Av. He's going into a church; what's he gonna do? Hey. Did you find it? Nobody's heard anything about a video of the murder. I think it might just be a rumor. Not interested in your opinion. Just find the f*cking video. Okay, I'll check Stalkerazzi again. How's Bridget doing? She's all right. All you need to do is sign it over. Are you sure this is the time? Yeah, I'm sure. How bad is it? It's bad. Do I need to close up shop? Nothing's coming back to you. You want a hug? No. Should I look for a new job? Wouldn't hurt. (Shorty coughing in distance) (coughing loudly) That don't sound so good. Are you all right? (panting) Yeah. Just keeping the oxygen on low. The f*cking tanks didn't come. You got to be f*cking kidding me. This is a major goddamn f*ck up. Today's the day. It's all set. Why didn't you take care of your goddamn oxygen? Christ, Mick. It's a f*cking mistake. (coughing) Calm down. Calm down, calm down. I'm so sorry, Mick. Here. Drink that. I'm so sorry. (sighs) All right. Let me think. How much does that safe weigh? Can three guys and a dolly move it? Sure. All right. So, uh... we get the safe, come back, grab you, crack it on the road. (chuckles) That can f*cking work. (chuckles) Daryll? Uh, that, uh, truck you're renting... does it have a lift? Woman (over TV) : The execution-style murders occurred over 72 hours ago, and still no suspects have been arrested. The LAPD have been tight-lipped as to who they are investigating. Mr. Brown, any comments, sir? This is a tragedy. The loss of two great talents. We got to do something in this country about gun violence. All right, let's go. Man : That was Cookie Brown, clearly distraught in the wake of these horrific events. And while little is known about the night in question, the friends and family of these two talented artists have found refuge... How you doing, sweetheart? Okay, Daddy. Not going to school today? I didn't feel like it today. All right. I found this in Conor's sock drawer. In case you're interested. We need to talk. Woman (over TV) : music we will now miss out on. The YouTube sensation, Marvin Gaye Washington, hadn't yet even released his first album. That's for you. What is this? What does ABC stand for? Abby, Bridget, Conor. It's a property in Malibu. You should hang on to it as long as you can. If you need the money, sell it. Why would I suddenly need money? Where you going, Ray? Maybe prison. Why? What did you do? Goddamn it. Is it that priest? The one in the gym? No. Will you f*cking tell me? There's a woman. When isn't there a woman? She's a reporter. She's gonna publish an article that says I brought Sully Sullivan out here. And I paid him to kill Mickey. Can't you stop her? I could. But I won't. I don't want this. Like Trousdale. Like everything. You think you can buy me off. I'm trying to take care of you and the kids. By killing their grandfather? Don't worry about us, Ray; we're taken care of. You think I'm gonna let that cop take care of my family? At least he's trying. He can take care of you while I'm away. He can f*ck you in my bed, for all I care. Dad! But while I'm here... he's gonna stay away from my family. It's fine, Conor. Go to your room. You buying pot now? Grandpa Mick gave them to me. I knew you'd be mad. Of course I'm mad. He's giving you f*cking drugs, Con. He wanted to apologize. For what? He feels real bad about what happened. He really cares about us. He's a really good guy; he gave me a car. All you give me is clothes I don't even f*cking like. Watch your f*cking mouth. He's a hero for the FBI, and you won't let him tell anybody. (scoffs) It's time to grow up, Con. I need you to be here. For your mom and your sister. What are you talking about? Just stay away from Mick. He loves us. Yeah? He loves you so m... Just shut up, Dad! Just shut up. What'd you do to him? Frank, clean out your desk. You're finished. Why? I did everything you told me to do. Because I'm tying up loose ends. What do you mean, "loose ends"? Early retirement, full pension, benefits for life, but you need to leave the building now. This is a sad day for the Bureau. Yesterday, we lost one of our own... Special Agent Thomas Volcheck. He was suffering from a serious depression, one that he could not overcome. We tried to get him help, but our efforts were, sadly, too late. Agent Volcheck was our best and brightest. And our hearts go out to his lovely widow Megan. This tragedy is proof that mental illness does not discriminate. Donna : Tommy wasn't depressed. He was... just... a sweet boy. (crying): A sweet boy. (crying) Thank you very much. (reporters clamoring) This is Catherine Shaughnessy's dog... Baby. What? Sully's girlfriend, Catherine. Where is she? How the f*ck should I know? Get off my boat. She came out here with Sully, didn't she? Is she in witness protection? Is she dead? Did you kill her, Frank? No. Sully did. Why? How the f*ck do I know? He was a psycho. Who killed Sully Sullivan? Mickey Donovan. Now, get off my f*cking boat. Ray, I need to see you. And don't f*cking ignore me. It's important. Please. Cochran : Kate McPherson's back in L.A. The little charade that you and Ray arranged obviously didn't work. She's still asking questions. And any question that leads back to me will eventually lead to you; you understand that, don't you? Completely. Woman has to be stopped. I agree. But why are you coming to me? You're a powerful man. You ought to be able to do something. Ray's got my hands tied. How? He caught me in a compromising position. Ray's clever. You're the only person in the world that he listens to. Yes, I am. I'm his father, in a way, the one that cares about him. I'll set him straight. Ezra, thank you for being a reasonable man. You understand that Ray can't know that I'm connected to anything that might happen. He won't. And I look forward to having a very powerful friend in Washington. Of course, Ezra. You will. (door closes) Hi, Grandpa. Oh. What the f*ck are you doing here, Conor? Well, Mom found the joints and I think Dad's going away somewhere. What do you want me to do about it? I just thought... I'm pretty goddamn disappointed in you, Conor. You don't just show up here. You said to come anytime. Well, this ain't the time. Dad's right... you are an asshole. You ain't going nowhere. I got business to do tonight, and you're gonna sit tight till I get back, you understand? Don't be upset. I lost my temper. Sit down. You all right? Yeah, Grandpa, I'm fine. All right, good. Listen. I got business to take care of. I need you to help me out and stay here. You do that for me, I'll tell you all about it when I get back. You gonna rob someplace, Grandpa? Relax. Sit back. Put your feet up. There's magazines under the bed. You get bored, knock on the door directly across the hall. You nervous? No. Yeah, well, I am. Well, what are you doing here? Mick needs me. Mickey's robbed a lot of banks. That was a long time ago. Yeah, well, that scam he pulled with you in Mexico... it worked, didn't it? (ringtone playing) Hello? What am I paying you for? To keep an eye on your father. He gave my kid drugs. I want him off the street, now. That wasn't the deal. I don't f*cking care. You get it done, you understand me? Look, I'll try to get some sh1t on him, but he's been behaving himself. He goes to work, comes home. Figure it out, asshole. Or I call your boss and tell him you're on the take. Who were you talking to? My wife. Raymond, do you know about the Jewish principle of the rodef? No, I don't. The rodef is someone who's pursuing another, trying to destroy them. They must be warned to stop. But if the rodef fails to heed that warning, then according to Jewish law, the rodef should be killed. I don't have time for this. Kate's the rodef, Raymond. She's trying to destroy us. Everything you and I have built. She's been warned. She has to be stopped. Listen to me, Ezra. Your precious RGOCC. What about it? There's a body buried there. Catholic priest. You... buried a Catholic priest at a Jewish hospital? Ruth's hospital? Ah! A Shanda! You cursed me, Raymond. You cursed Ruth's legacy. Anything happens to Kate McPherson, that body comes up. (cell phone vibrating) Yeah, Lena? I just got a call from my plant at Stalkerazzi; you were right. Somebody's got a video of the Re-Kon shooting. So Marty's gonna set up a meeting with them for later today. Good. And, Ray... Cookie Brown's waiting for you at Pink's. All right. Thanks. Darius : Yo, Cook! What you want? I want the Rosie O'Donnell with fries. I got the video. Ooh! My man! Hey, let's go, right now. Got the million dollars right here. You can't go. It's my money, ain't it? You can't be seen anywhere near that video, Cookie. Why not? You think it's gonna incriminate me? For what? I'm just a concerned citizen. Hey, get Omar in here; we going. You're not going. You told me I work for you now. Let me do my job. You got to trust me, Cookie. Done. But as soon as you get it, you bring it straight to me. Right. You want something to eat, Ray? No, I'm good. What are we following this guy for? (siren whoops) The f*ck you doing? He ran a red light. Who gives a sh1t? What's wrong with you? License, registration, proof of insurance. What the f*ck going on? You ran a red light. (laughs) What? We didn't run no goddamn red light. License and registration. You look real nervous. You okay? Shut the f*ck up and step out of the car. Jim, what are you doing? What I got to step out for? 'Cause I'm a black man riding in a $235,000 car? You heard me. Get the f*ck out of the car. Dave : Jim. Can I speak to you? Yeah, Jim. Go talk to your partner. Y'all figure this sh1t out. Get the f*ck out of the car like I just told you! I'm not f*cking getting out of this car! Hey, hey, yo! Put your hands where the man can see them. Now, my brother, you know this is some bullshit. You're good. Get the f*ck out of here. Yeah. I know we're good, m*therf*cker. What the f*ck was that? Nothing. You want to tell me what's in your pocket? What are you talking about? I saw you reach in your pocket when you pulled him over. 
 
 (cell phone vibrating) Avi : Abby's boyfriend just pulled over Cookie Brown, and then let him go. f*ck. Boss, Lena says you're giving away property? Signing deeds? Not now, Avi. What's going on? You get a paycheck, don't you? Just cash it, stop asking me f*cking questions. Come on, let's go. Come on. You go, too. We're closing. You sure, hon? You know you liked it last time. Not tonight. I get married tomorrow. I need sperm to be strong for wedding night. Besides, last time you chafed me. I never chafed nobody in my f*cking life. Come on, let's go. Come on, Boris. If you're getting married tomorrow night, tonight's your bachelor party. Yeah? I'll give you a discount. (Boris panting, moaning) (grunting, shouting in Russian) Thanks for being here, Terry. Means a lot to me. I'm here 'cause I got no choice. And why'd you get Daryll mixed up in this? (door beeps, handle turns) Son of bitch. Let's go. What? So where's the f*cking safe? It was right here. It's got to be here somewhere. Here it is. I told you. We got to lift that? That's what you're here for. What the f*ck took so long?! Keep your f*cking voice down. Daryll, grab the dolly. Let's get this safe the hell out of here. Anyone comes along, flash the badge. Get rid of them. I know why I'm here. You have a lot of crazy sh1t. My dad made that for me. Was he at camp? (chuckles) No. He was in Alcatraz at the time. Did he escape? Nobody escapes The Rock, kid. (knocking) Here you go, Shorty. There you are! Where you been? You supposed to be here yesterday. I'm almost out. I know, I know. Kid, could you bring one of those over? Sure. Here, hook it on for me. (sighs) Yeah, turn it all the way up. Ah, yeah. That's the stuff. (breathes deeply) Are you sick? I... inhaled a lot of Agent Orange in Vietnam. Are you gonna die? Yeah, I think so. What's going on with Marty? Am I going over there or not? Nobody's shown up yet. f*ck. Check again. They have someone in your office. I'm going home. Should have stayed there. You didn't scare me off. I have my story. Congratulations. Maybe you'll win another Pulitzer. You brought Sully out here. He killed a lot of people. Aren't you responsible for that? I don't know, Kate. I'm just f*cking tired. No, Ray, you're sick. You need help. What do you want? I don't know. Maybe I thought you'd beg me not to do it. I'm sorry, Ray. What are you sorry for? You're just doing your job. Terry : One, two, three. (grunting) (straining): Go, go, go, go, go, go! All right. We're going forward. All right, all right. It's all in the angle, it's all in the angle. I got to move here. This is for you. This is for Avi. What is this, severance? I'm out of a job? No, I don't want... I don't want this. I don't want this. I just... I want to keep working, same as Avi. Take it, Lena. I don't know what's going on with you. But you won't tell me, and you won't tell Avi. So f*ck you. I don't need your money. I'll be fine. You'll be fine? How many girlfriends have you beaten up? How many times I had to bail you out? Take the f*cking money. (phone ringing) What? Stalkerazzi. It's on. All right, thank you. (TV playing quietly) (laughs) I got one for you. How many Vietnam vets does it take to screw in a lightbulb? I don't know. How many? You weren't there, man! (Both laugh) Oh, I feel dizzy. Why don't you go lay down in Mick's bed. I might have bed bugs, and I don't want to get yelled at. Okay. One, two, three. (muffled shouting) Jesus f*cking Christ. Shh, shh. Boris : I'm locked up in here! In here! Here. Go shut him up. Don't give me no f*cking orders. Boris : I'm in here! Anyone! Help! f*cking morons are still here? Shut your mouth. Armored truck came this morning. What? You made big mistake. Bullshit. You do your pickups on Thursdays. We changed company. They come early. You're lying to me. You will find out. (curses in Russian) (cell phone vibrating) Yeah. How much would it be worth to you if I could put your father away tonight? You tell me. A hundred grand. For that much, it'd better stick. I'm talking felony... 20 years. Do it. Ray. I was just getting ready to call you. Sure you were. Where's the video, Marty? I'm getting it, but... But what? Well, now they want two million. Now, Ray, look, I saw it. It's worth it. Where are they? I'm not sure. They're supposed to contact me in the next 30 minutes. You're a f*cking liar, Marty. Ray? Don't start any sh1t in my place of business. Get ready to call someone. Troy, stand your ground. You know what I did to Chip, right? Is he worth it? f*ck you. I want my $2,000. He means $20,000. How many copies of this did you make? We didn't make any copies. I didn't ask you. I asked him. None, I swear. Come on, come on, come on, come on, man. What's taking this dude so long? Mickey : Relax, kid. What'd you bring him in for anyway, Mick? He's not family. What was I supposed to do? I still got this ankle bracelet on, don't I? You're so worried about him, go check. Where is he? Your friend? He took the keys. He f*cked you. What? (laughs) Son of a... (panting) Mickey : What's going on in there? I'm locked in! Where's Ronald? He f*cked us over! Get the f*ck out of here, Mick! (sirens approaching) Get out of here. Terry... Terry. (sirens approaching) Drive. Where's Terry? Just drive, son. (engine starts) (two gunshots over phone) (tires screech) Daddy? (cell phone vibrating) Talk to me, Ray Donovan. Did you get it? Yeah. Well, when am I gonna see it? Right now. Where can I meet you? My house. Half an hour. I'll go get Shorty. All right, hurry the f*ck up, Pop. We got cops up our ass. Be right back. (oxygen hissing) (sighs) (gas hissing) (alarm ringing) (tires screeching) Conor? Conor! Conor : Grandpa... (grunts) What the f*ck?! Con! (sirens approaching) (groans) You all right? Huh? You all right? I think it's broken. (panting) Here. Let's get you up. (groans) Let's get out of here. Let's go, come on. Jesus help me. What the f*ck happened? (coughs) I think Shorty blew. Oh, damn, Shorty. I think I killed him. You didn't kill no one. Keep moving. (phone ringing) Con? Dad? I'm at Grandpa's. What? There was an explosion, and I think I broke my arm. Jesus Christ. (tires screeching) Stay there, Conor. I'm coming. Okay. What'd he say? He's coming? He's on his way. Thank you. How is your mother? She is good. Good. I'm worried about Ray. Me, too. You're a good friend to him. When he lets me. Avi, are you an observant Jew? I try. Have you ever heard of the law of the rodef? (sighs) (ringing) Jim : Abby... I couldn't do it. (sighs) (keypad beeping) (indistinct chatter) Right there. Hey, Conor. What happened? You okay? It's probably just a hairline fracture. We need an X-ray to be sure. Where you taking him? County. Nah, he'll be there all night. I'll take him to Cedars myself. Come on, Conor. Well, at least let me wrap it. I'll go do it in the ambulance. Come with me. Just... watch your step over here. Just hop on into the ambulance there. How fast do you think he went? It was instant. I'm sorry. Mickey : Thank God for that, anyway. You almost killed your grandson. You happy now? He's tougher than you think, but we got bigger problems. Terry needs some help. The f*ck are you talking about? He's gonna need a lawyer. We pulled a little job. Ray, you got to make sure he keeps his mouth shut. You dragged him into your sh1t? He begged me to come in on it. He begged me. You're a f*cking liar. Where is he? Cops probably got him by now. You need to hook him up with Ezra; it's serious. Armed robbery. (officers shouting) I'll f*cking kill you! You hear me?! Get off! I'll f*cking kill you! Get off him! Thank you, Officer. I'm all right. I'm all right. Hey. You need to f*cking calm down. Sorry. You hear me? Yeah. Don't f*cking move. I'll f*cking kill you! You hear me?! Don't f*cking go near him again! Get him the f*ck away from me! (grunts) No! Please, you don't understand. I got to take care of my kid! Oh, f*ck. Conor! Conor! It's all right. Just go with them. It's all right, Con. It's all right. (phone vibrating) f*ck. I'm here waiting, m*therf*cker. Where are you? I need to see that video, Ray. I'm his grandfather. I'll take care of it. Officer : You okay? Yeah. Get him out of here.
