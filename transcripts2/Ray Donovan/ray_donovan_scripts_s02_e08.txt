 Previously on  Ray Donovan... 
 Debra : Yes, this is Debbie Gerson from Paramount Pictures. 
 I'm trying to reach Mickey Donovan. 
 Well, they say write about what you know. 
 I know two things: robbing banks and f*cking black chicks. 
 Let's see where that goes. 
 Re-Kon! 
 You know how long I've been trying to sign this guy? 
 And his little protégé... 
 gonna be the black Justin Bieber. 
 Cookie! 
 Boy, I love the way you sing, my nigga. 
 Thanks for these. 
 You're supposed to be home studying. 
 Well, we celebrating. Cookie's back. 
 Back from where, fool? Prison? 
 You work with Lee Drexler, right? 
 Tell that nigga he owe me a phone call. 
 Bridget :  I'm gonna keep seeing him. 
 You can't stop me. He's got some dangerous friends, Bridg. It's not your world. Sully didn't die the way the FBI said he did. I can't finish my book until I know what really happened. You were right. I've been lying to you. My father and I have been working with the FBI. What about Sully's girlfriend? Do you know where she is? We're not gonna allow Mr. Donovan to answer that ques... Mickey : She's in witness protection. Claudette... my one true love. She's married now; she lives in Palm Springs with a big producer, Allen Weisbrod. He's good to you? - Yes, he is. This woman's body was found in the oil fields two days ago. Did you f*ck her, Mick? - Yeah. But I didn't kill her. Sully did. You're not going anywhere. And you're not selling that f*cking gym, either. That's not a boxing gym; that's a laundromat. That's how he cleans up all his cash. You lied to me. You made me a criminal just like you. We got the house. Ray : I'm glad you're happy. But you can't afford the house in Trousdale. I want that house, Harriet. I've only had s*x with one person in the last 20 years. How much do we like each other? Abby (laughs) :  A lot. Mom came home at 2:00 a.m. last night. (sighs) (sighs softly) (phone vibrating) Yes? You know anything? Boss, I don't want to do this. You don't get to tell me what you want to f*cking do. You know anything or not? Boss... You want to keep your job? No. Yeah, you do. Just do it, Av. (camera clicking) Hi. - Hi. Want to go up to the room now? Let's get some breakfast. Okay. Ez : How was your honeymoon leave? Lanai was fine, Ezra. Until I got back and found out my partner spent the entire time I was away raising money for a dead woman's hospital. A dead woman? Ruth was the love of my life. I thought we were a law firm, not a f*cking construction company. You're getting too old for this, Ezra. Morning, counselor. (phone vibrating) Yeah. Cookie Brown is here at my house with two guys. Calm down, Lee. They're gonna kill me. If they were gonna kill you, you'd already be dead. I'm on my way. (sighs softly) (rap music playing, cell phone ringing) Yo. Terry. We got to talk. I'm done talking to you, Ray. (phone beeps) (line ringing) Harriet : Harriet here. Did you get it done? You just told me to do this last night. I need it today. How am I supposed to do good f*cking work under these conditions, Ray? What if I wanted to give the gym to my brother? Not the way we set it up. You hear me? We could all go to jail. You okay? I'm fine, Daddy. Need anything? No. I love you, sweetheart. You, too, Daddy. (bus approaching) Sorry. I'm really nervous. Usually we meet up in the room and f*ck. Are you breaking up with me? No, I'm not breaking up with you. I just need to know if you're serious about this. If you're all in. I have a family. It's complicated. I can't tell you if I'm all in or not. I think I'm in love with you. That's got to be enough. Take it or leave it. I'll take it. (rap music playing) Get in, Shawty. Mickey : Hey. "Fat Black Ass." Family member? What's my son paying you to do this? Why don't you shut the f*ck up! You know what? I'm gonna call the parole office, report your ass. I'll violate you so fast. Go ahead, call my office. Report the dope yourself. That’s from Shorty across the hall. Mm-hmm. (cell phone ringing) This is Mickey Donovan. I just told a great producer your pitch, and he wants to hear it from you. Who's that? Jerry Weiss. He's one of the most important producers in Hollywood, Mickey. Jerry wants us to come to his house. He's having a cocktail party. (quietly): Paramount Pictures. I need you here to go over the pitch before we go. I'll be right there. You ain't going nowhere. Debbie, we have a problem. You're gonna have to come to me. Dick. (phone beeps) (line ringing) Abby (recorded) : Hey, this is Abby Donovan. I can't answer your call. Please leave a message. (phone beeps) (sighs) (phone vibrating) Ray : Hey. Did you read the article? Yeah. Did you like it? Yeah. Why didn't you call me? Sorry, I've been busy. Do you miss me? Yeah. You still want to f*ck me? Of course. "Of course"? You know what, Ray? Call me when you give a f*ck. Do you remember me? Mrs. Shaughnessy. Come in. I read your article this morning. You never mentioned my daughter Catherine. You just forgot her like everybody else. I didn't forget. What did you find out about my daughter? You should call the FBI. I have called the FBI a hundred f*cking times! They lie to me! I need to know what happened to her. I think she's in witness protection. Where did you hear that? I can't name my source, but... That's a f*cking lie. We had a deal. If she went into witness protection, she was gonna send me a postcard, and she never did. No, Missy. She's dead. Asking if you were all in... that was wrong. You think so? I do. I think it's sexy. No, you don't. Yes, I do. I really, really do. (camera clicking) (mutters in Hebrew) (sighs) The kid has a contract with Re-Kon. It's binding! End of story! Hey, hey, look. Ain't no need to be getting all upset and sh1t, all right? Let's just keep it respectable. Respectable? You break into my f*cking house... Y'all want some more coffee? Stop offering people sh1t! This is a home invasion! Cookie : This ain't no goddamn home invasion. If you would've called me back, I wouldn't be here. Ray Donovan. What's happening, fool? Put that away. This? Conversation piece is all. Put it away. You gonna take it from me, Ray? (chuckles) You're no fun. Get rid of them. Y'all heard the man. Fall back. What do you want, Cookie? Five years ago, before I went to Folsom, I gave Re-Kon the money to start his label. $30,000. You had an oral agreement... no contract. You do know what "contract" means Mr. Straight Outta Compton? My money, my sweat, my risk on these motherfucking streets is my contract. You didn't answer my question. Look, if I wanted to, I can come up in here and take all of Re-Kon's sh1t, but I won't. I just want the kid. Look, why don't we just call Re-Kon's ho ass up here and sort all this sh1t out? Re-Kon's not coming over. You deal with me. And nothing happens till you get out of this house. Let's bounce. You heard him. Get the f*ck out. What the f*ck is that on your neck? (chuckles): What is that Frankenstein sh1t? Did you get a face-lift? No. I, uh, I cut myself shaving. This man got a face-lift. Damn, look. Let me see that sh1t. Cookie, time to go. How long is this gonna take? A few hours. All right, nigga. (door opens) (door closes) Get Re-Kon over here now. (moaning) Hey. (laughs) When we f*ck... you always do it different. What does that mean? You don't just get off on me, you... You always do different stuff. Is that a problem? No, it's good. Good. (cell phone chimes) No, don't take it. Oh, sh1t. Who is it? I got to call my daughter. (groans) (both sigh) (cell phone ringing) Hey, honey. Where are you? I'm home, Mama. Where are you? I'm running errands. Um... what's wrong? I don't feel so good. Oh, no. I'll come home now. No, you don't... you don't have to come back home. I... I'm just gonna go back to sleep. Are you sure? Yeah, Mama, I'm sure. Okay, honey. I'll see you in a few hours. Okay. (sighs) I have kids. Does that bother you? No. I like kids. Liar. I do. (laughs) Lena : Hey. (groans) Here you go. She's f*cking somebody else. I can't tell him. No, you have to tell him. No. Out of the question. Come on, Avi, you never f*cked a married woman? No. Well, you know I have. What do you care if she's f*cking around? She has every right. Ray's been f*cking around on her for years. I can't tell him. Well, if you don't tell him, I will. I'll kill the cop instead. The kid is mine... his mama signed the papers. Did you take Cookie's money or not? f*ck the money! It's about the kid! Doesn't matter, Re-Kon. He's my son. I did every single thing you asked me to do. I put him in school, I got him a private tutor, kept him off drugs. All right, he smokes a little weed. But every kid in the world smokes weed. Lee : Why are we even talking about this? Cookie Brown has no written contract. We're keeping the kid; end of story. How are you gonna protect him, Lee? Restraining order? We're talking about Cookie Brown. What'd he go away for, Re-Kon? Bottom line, Ray, you work for me. Do what I f*cking tell you. And you work for me. (sighs) Ray's right. It's some street sh1t. I love that little nigga. Cookie gonna f*ck his head up. I'll talk to him. Try to make sure Marvin's okay. What are you doing, Ray? That kid's worth millions. You don't f*ck with Cookie Brown, Lee. Oh, yeah? You don't f*ck with Lee Drexler. Don't put any ideas in Re-Kon's head, all right? He's got to do this. And what the f*ck is with Ezra? His brain tumor back? You didn't know I knew about that, huh? Debbie Gerson. Paramount Pictures. I'm looking for Mickey Donovan. I'm Ronald Keith, Mickey's parole officer. He's not going anywhere unless I say so. Wow. You're tough. So you really signed Mickey Donovan to a movie contract? Yes. You ever consult on anything? Consult? How? Like, on a film set. You got a card? Mickey Donovan ain't going nowhere with you today. $250 an hour... unless, of course, you end up giving us story ideas. Then it's a whole other thing. Oh, girl, come on. No, I'm serious. We use guys like you all the time. You got a card? You met, huh? They already made a deal; you're going to the party. (chuckles) 
 
 Hi. I'm getting dressed. You want to step outside? Did you get the loan? Yeah, I got it. But I hate the f*cking interest rate. I can do much better if you just give me a little more... This one's fine. Hey. Your brother sent back his paychecks. Mickey :  He comes out of the bank. A dozen cops are shooting at him. (imitates gunfire) Jumps in the car. Drives to Roxbury. There's a black Cadillac parked behind the projects. He throws the bag with the cash in the trunk. Finds his girl. Kisses his baby boy good-bye. Gives her the keys to the car. When he comes out, the cops are waiting for him... he's f*cked. They cuff him and take him away. His girl gets in the black Cadillac with his baby, drives west toward California. The end. (clicks tongue softly) That's great. (laughs) That's beautiful, Mick. We're gonna make three pictures together. We'll go to Cannes in May and sell your life rights. You know why I like this story? It's about real men. Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Mitchum. They drank, they f*cked. Like us. Not these f*cking teenage superheroes. These boys on screen today couldn't find a clit in a forest of clits. Mick, you with me? Oh. Oh, yeah. (chuckles) Hundred percent. (hip-hop music playing) What are you doing here? Look, Terry, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied to you. You make a good living here. You're happy. What the f*ck's the difference? Are you gonna stop using this place as a front or not? I can't. Then get the f*ck out. All right, this place is closing early today. Everybody out. Everybody out! (ringtone playing) Ray : You gonna be home later? What's that supposed to mean? I got something for you to sign. Bridge? I got that soup you like. (accompaniment to "Sunny" playing) (ringtone playing) Hello? Abby : Where the hell are you? I'm out with Marvin. (exhales) What's that noise in the background? It's music. We're at the studio; we're recording. No, you're not. You're gonna come home right now, young lady. No. I'm staying here. I'm doing something that I like with somebody I love. Why can't you understand that? Bridge, honey... Let's run it from the top? We're not waiting on Re-Kon? No, I got this.

I like it. (laughs softly) Come here. What'll you have? You know a guy named Kenneth Benson? They called him Tiny. He went out to L.A. a few weeks ago. I'd like to speak with anyone who knew him. You want a drink or not? Scotch. On the rocks. (phone vibrating) (door opens) What do you got, Avi? Boss, I think you should leave this alone. Just show me what you f*cking have. I got these from our guy in Internal Affairs. This guy Jim... he's in homicide. Did his patrol work in the 77th Division. He was a finalist for Medal of Valor. He's a good cop. Where are the pictures? Uh, right there in the folder. The other pictures. No, boss. No other pictures. Get the f*ck away from me. Ray. I'm sorry, boss. I... Hey. (soft knocking) This a bad time? No. Thanks, Lena. All right, come on. You got some emotional M*therf*ckers working for you. I know you're probably thinking I'm some type of pimp, coming after Re-Kon because he's a bitch. But I ain't here for no paycheck. Nobody pays to keep me in check. I want equity. I spoke to Re-Kon and Lee. You got the kid. Where you gonna take him? Take him? There's gonna be hard feelings. I think you ought to get him out of L.A. Who gives a f*ck about hard feelings? (chuckles): Oh. m*therf*cker. You want to keep the kid away from baby girl, huh? I get that. Like I said... I'm a father, too. I get you, Ray Donovan. Ain't no problem. South Beach it is. I got you the deal, Cookie. Now get the f*ck out of here. Back in the day, we only had one rule. You never rob from each other. You always rob from the Jews. Any of you Jewish? (chuckles) Nah, there's no Jews here. So, Mick, what would you steal from my place? Take your cash. Then I'd find your safe. Then I'd crack it. You do got a safe, Jerry? Mm-hmm. Upstairs, behind the Monet. I wouldn't take your f*cking art. Too hard to fence. I'd take your cash and, uh... Yeah, stuff like this. You know how much those are worth? 50 bucks, all melted down. $3,000. Per place setting. Whoa. (chuckles) My fingers are itching. Hey, Jerry, you old f*ck. Sorry I'm late. I want you to meet someone. Mick? Allan. What are you doing here? He's my guest, Allan. Your guest? He's the biggest piece-of-shit con artist in the whole world. He's my guest, Allan.

I guess we both like to f*ck black chicks, Mickey. Oh, I don't f*ck Claudette. I make love to her. (shouts) You got her when I was in the joint, but I'm out now. (Allan gasping) sh1t. Can you hold this for me? (coughs) Mick, Mick, Mick, Mick. That's enough. That's enough. We're just talking here. You need to leave. It's a little love tap is all. Right, Allan? Okay. All right, Mick. Time to go. What the f*ck was that about? He's an asshole. (line ringing) (click) Catherine Shaughnessy isn't in witness protection, is she, Ray? You f*cking lied to me, didn't you? What else isn't true about the story you sold me? All of it? Part of it? Say something. Let it go, Kate. Let it go? Who the f*ck do you think you're talking to? Some L.A. piece-of-shit starlet? You got your story. If this story isn't true, then I am destroyed, Ray. Don't you understand that? My reputation is on the line. It's all I have. Don't you f*cking get that? I have to go. (horn honks as vehicle alarm sets) (house door closes) (gun cocks) I figured we'd meet one of these days. You need to stop seeing my wife. That's up to her. No, it's not. You know I'm a cop. I don't give a f*ck. Go ahead. Pull the f*cking trigger. That thing with Allan? Don't worry about it. We had fun. Jerry gets it. He knows who I am. You don't know what's gonna happen, Mick, do you? Nothing's gonna happen, girlie. Don't be so dramatic. (phone rings) It's Jerry. Hon? Yeah, Jerry? Put me on the speaker. You're on. Mickey? Yeah? You're a great guy. I love you. But we got a problem. Allan? Allan. Sorry, Debra. But I can't make this movie. So what? He won't do it, we'll get someone else. No one will f*cking touch it now, Mickey. (scoffs) You went to his house. What would I have seen if I had taken pictures of you, Ray? How many f*cking women would there be? I need you to sign these papers. What are they? Loan papers for the new house. I don't want it anymore. Yes, you do. Don't you get it? I never wanted that f*cking house! All I ever wanted was for you to look at me. But you can't. You can't look at me, you can't talk to me. You can't share your pain with me. Share my pain? What f*cking good is that gonna do you or anyone else in this house? Sign the papers. It's too late, Ray. Sign the f*cking papers. All right. f*ck you. f*ck. (sighs) Christ. Leave me alone. Stay the f*ck away from me. Abs... (phone buzzing) Yeah. What is it? Lee : We're keeping the kid. You're what? Yeah. I thought about it. We owe him money, and that's it. That's all we owe him. So I messengered him a check for $150,000. That's five times his initial investment. Warren Buffett wouldn't turn that down. You're making a big mistake, Lee. I don't think so, Ray. I've had music clients for 20 years. I understand black people. They're all about the Benjamins, baby. If Cookie has a problem with us, we'll see him in court. You think f*cking this guy is gonna make you feel better, but it won't. It feels pretty f*cking good right now, Ray. You're not gonna see him anymore. I want you to go. I don't want you in this house anymore. This is my f*cking house. I'm the one that's been here every f*cking day! I've been here taking care of this f*cking family, watching you destroy everything! Go to your f*cking apartment! You're happier there. Go live in that f*cking shithole and f*ck whoever you want to f*ck! Oh, f*ck! (spits) You get out. (panting) You get the f*ck out. Get out! Just go. (panting) Just go, please. (panting) (horse racing broadcast playing indistinctly) Shorty : Hey, Mick. How'd it go? Eh, all right. That don't sound so good. You know, maybe this, uh, Hollywood thing wasn't such a good idea. Y-You want to come in for a drink? Sure. (laughing) That... that silver plate or real? Real. (laughs) Sweet. You know, Shorty, from now on, we're gonna dine like kings. Like f*cking kings. Marvin (on sound system) : ♪ Summertime, you're so fine ♪ 
♪ So divine ♪ 
♪ Blows my mind, you're so true♪ 
♪ I love you ♪ 
♪ Every single way ♪ Bridget : ♪ Sunny ♪ 
♪ Thank you for the sunshine bouquet... ♪ That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. See, that's that crossover sh1t... every five minutes on the radio,  Today Show,  Grammy sh1t. You did it. We did it. Oh, wow... (coughs) It's your moment, son. It's your time. You ready? Hell, yeah. How 'bout you, babe? You ready to do this with me? I love you, Marvin. Love you, too, Shawty. (sighs) ("Sunny" continues playing) (music throbbing from inside car) ("Sunny" continues playing) (both laughing) Oh, sh1t. Hey, C-Cookie. Cookie, you don't have to do this. I won't tell nobody. I swear to f*ckin' God. I-I w-won't say sh1t. Hey, Cook... I'll roll with you, man. You got my word. We can still do this. Sorry, kid. I tried. (engine revs, tires squeal) (shuddering breaths, quiet sobs) Marvin... (sobbing): Marvin... (sobs quietly) (sobs) (voice breaking): Daddy...?
