 Previously on Ray Donovan: 
 Ray : I went to Mexico and brought him back. 
 It's out of my hands. You think I want him here? I'm so f*cking tired of you lying to me. Seany-boy, are you in there? Help me. I can't, kid. (gunshot) I'd like to ask you  a few questions about Sean Walker. You know his movie Black Mass? I was a consultant on it. I need you to say that you were with me last night. Ezra : Ray said you'd stolen a lot of money  from Sully. I did it for this chick,  Claudette, my one true love. Ray : You like this place, don't you? Bridget : I do, Daddy. If I applied, do you think I'd get in? I'm gonna make sure that she is banned from Marlborough, Harvard-Westlake... all of them. 'Cause your husband f*cked my girlfriend. Aah! Mrs. Sullivan, I'm Kate McPherson from the Boston Globe. I'm writing a book about your son. I don't think he would have left you unless there was some compelling reason. Do you think Catherine was with him? He f*cking murdered her. The girlfriend? The FBI is lying. I'm not sending you to L.A. I'm going, Bob. Ray : Lena, I need you and Avi to get me everything you can on Ed Cochran. He's on the short list to be the head of the FBI. Ray : You put him on parole, you won't be able to control him. Cochran : Well, I'm not gonna control him, Ray, you are. If he f*cks up, Ray : $15,000...  It's a lot for a parole officer. Oh, yeah. You come with me, or I'll violate  your ass so f*cking quick, you won't know what f*cking hit you. Price range gonna work? Maybe Ray has more than he lets on? Ray : I want you to meet me someplace. You like it? Really, Ray? I'm gonna make it happen, Abs. (Spanish music playing) You can put me on death f*cking row before I peel another carrot, m*therf*cker. No comprende, asshole. Hmm? Do the job you're paid for. The test for private schools has five categories, across math, science and English. The top score in each is a nine. Three nines and two eights. Wow. (soft chuckle) So proud of you, Bridg. Wait, I didn't know you still wanted to switch schools. I think I do, Daddy. Ray : Why didn't you say something? I wanted to take the test to know if I had a chance. Uh, look, this is a good school. But with the budget cuts, we don't have the facilities to challenge students like Bridget. She belongs at a school like Bel Air Academy. That door may be closed. (phone buzzes) We have to talk about this. Hey. Put that away. So Sullivan comes to the marina, thinking he's getting on a boat to Mexico with false passports. Now, he's a cagey b*st*rd, you know that. But we were ready for him. So when he drew his gun, Special Agent Barnes drew his. When it was all over, my guy was still alive. I told him to his face, I said, "Frank, you're a hero." He said, "Boss, I'm just doing my job." When can I talk to him? I wish I could make him available to you, I just can't. You're really not gonna let me interview the agent that shot Sully Sullivan? He's on another case, Ms. McPherson. Anything else I can help you with? Yeah. Mickey Donovan. He was part of Sully's gang and he's paroled here in Los Angeles. Any connection? Donovan? Donovan... Uh, no, that name hasn't come up during this investigation. Huh. I'll talk to him. What? I'll talk to Stu Feldman. What are you gonna talk about? He banned her from Bel Air Academy, Ray, forever. (sighs) I'll find a way, Abs, all right? What are you gonna do, break his legs? Will you stop? Is he still with that girl? I don't know. Even if he is, it doesn't matter. Look, Abs, this is my side of the street, all right? You let me take care of it? Stop worrying so much. House in Trousdale, kid in Bel Air... what are you so worried about? I'll see you later. I'm meeting Deb. All right. See you, Bridg. Are you mad at me? Mad at you? Of course not. Proud of you. You know what you want, you went after it. How'd you get so smart? I got it from you, Daddy. Nah. Your mom's the smart one. Sometimes she says "irregardless" when the word is "regardless." (short chuckle) (Laughs) Yeah, well, irregardless of that, she's your mother and she loves you. So you want to go to Bel Air, huh? I do, Daddy. What if they find out that I was busted for pot? You weren't busted. They let you go. One stupid cop made a mistake. End of story. Then why can't we tell Mom? 'Cause it'd freak her out. Why worry her over nothing? Daddy, it really seemed like it wasn't random. Like it was about me. It wasn't about you, all right? Put that out of your head. See you later. Bye. Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you. I hope you have a great stay in Los Angeles. Sully had a girlfriend. Catherine Shaughnessy. She never left his side for 20 years. You know where she is? Ms. McPherson... Is she in hiding? Did she help you out? Off the record. Is Catherine Shaughnessy in witness protection? I never go off the record. (phone rings) Yeah? Get the f*ck in here right the f*ck now. I'm busy. Okay, Ray. Explain it to your wife and kids when the SWAT team bangs down your door and drags you out of your f*cking house tonight. The f*ck... All right, get out. Okay. Get out. Let's get this straight. (door closes) You go near my family or threaten them again, I'll f*cking kill you. You understand? Who the f*ck is Catherine Shaughnessy? No one you need to worry about. Then why is The Boston Globe's Lois Lane  asking me questions about her? She was Sully's girlfriend. Where is she now? Aw, Jesus, here we go again. You don't want to know. Oh, but I really do. She's dead. Sully strangled her. My associate, Avi, was driving 'em out here. He helped Sully bury her in the desert. Jesus F. Christ. I mean... Trust me, no one's gonna find the body. Especially not a reporter from Boston. She was also asking questions about your father. What's her name? Avi : Yeah, boss. There's a reporter from Boston here, Kate McPherson. Get me everything you can on her. Will do. And keep her away from Mick. (phone chimes off) (sighs) Ray, what do you think? It’s a long way from the Mouseketeers. You smell me? It's the deodorant I stole from your bathroom the night you f*cked me. (door opens) What are you doing here? Did I call you? Scott, did he call me? No, Stu. Did he make an appointment? No, Stu. Hey, Ray, buddy. What are you doing here? You ever take testosterone? No. No, of course not. You know, they probably milk it from you like blood plasma. It's f*cking me up. I got pimples all over my back and an abscess on my ass so deep you could hide the profits from five Tommy Wheeler movies. Your little girlfriend? She's driving me insane, man. I get her a record deal, right? The label sends her to a stylist. $800 later, they chop her hair off. Now she looks like my kid Jamie. I almost f*cked him the other night. All right, you came to me, so what do you want? My kid wants to go to Bel Air Academy. The... Ray Donovan wants a favor from me. Lexi Steele. You know her work? No. She's a p0rn star. She's been called the Meryl Streep of the gang bang. And I have tried 50 times to get this woman to come and f*ck me. But no matter what I offer, they pass. What would you do, Ray? I'd leave that alone. Yeah, well, I can't. You need to go and figure out why she's turning me down and what I have to do to get her to f*ck me. I do this, Bridget goes to Bel Air? (Spanish music playing) (sighs) (exhales) Uh... I'm taking cinco. (overlapping chatter) Oh... What's up, carnal? Gracias, amigo. I can't, fellas. They got me on parole. They're testing my ass. I'm on parole, too, ese. Yeah. You gotta get one of these and then you can smoke. Get what? What is that, Pablo? It's my prescription, homes. They can't take away a man's prescription medication. It's legal, man. Not for him. (men muttering) Why am I so important to you? God sees every sparrow that falls. Come on. I got something for you. Sit down. You gotta do this here? Now, you charge it half an hour for every 24 hours. And if you don't make it home by 6:00, you'd better call me, do you understand? Or do I have to say that in Spanish? I got it. Sit down. You're here... during the day. You're home during the night. Do all your clients get this personal attention? No. Only the ones I like. (phone ringing) Answer that. (sighs) Mick, it's Claudette. Claudette. (sighs) To hear your voice right now... you don't know how it just saved my life. Where are you? I'm here in town. I have to see you. Is 6:00 too early for dinner? No. What's your favorite place to go in town? Mick, that's not why I'm calling. Ever been to Musso and Franks? 6:00 p.m. See you there. Is that your lady friend? She can meet you at your place. That's the mother of my youngest son. We have parenting issues to discuss. Okay. How old is your son? 30. Then she could be Mother Teresa. If that monitor shows up on Hollywood Boulevard, your ass is going back to prison. Now you get back to work. Deb : This area was out of favor for a while,  but it's coming back. This is the time to buy. And it's much closer to Bel Air Academy. Who's going to Bel Air? Maybe Bridget is. She aced the test. Can you believe it? She is a f*cking genius. Oh, honey, I am so happy for you. I know. (knocking) Hello? Yes? Judy Hoffman. Neighbor. Hi. I saw the door was open, and I was hoping for a peek. I live across the street. Come in. This is Abby Donovan. I'm Deb Goldman. May be your new neighbor. Such a beautiful house. I love this architecture. Oh. You're from Boston. Calabasas. But originally. Do I know you? No. As soon as you said "nay-buh" and "ah-ki-tek-chuh," you gave it away. I find it charming. Charming. Really? (laughs) Do you think your speech sounds natural to me? Your flat, dead, Valley girl, California, take-my-teens-to-the-fucking-mall accent? Deb : Abby? We have other houses to see. Hmm. (crowd chatter) (phone chimes) (sighs) Yeah. Oh. (woman laughs) Mmm. I think I know a few people who know you, Ray. I've-I've heard your name. How can I help you? I got a client who's, uh, willing to pay $20,000 to have s*x with one of your actresses. My choice or his? Lexi Steele. Lexi Steele's my wife. How about I offer you 20 grand to f*ck your wife? You gonna take that deal? No, I wouldn't. Does this look like a brothel to you? My wife is a... is an actress. She's not a prostitute. She makes movies with other professional p0rn actors who are tested regularly by doctors, and we have a guild. We win awards, we pay taxes. I get it. I get it. You have standards. f*cking A right. I got standards. The last guy who treated my wife like a whore... I tied him up! And I put him in a closet for three days. Really? Yeah. Good to know. Can I take one of those for my client? Well, I get $50 for those at the p0rn conventions. People line up for hours, so... Sure. (woman moaning on screen) (music playing on car radio) (turns radio off) Ray, Katherine McPherson, 38 years old. She's a reporter. She writes books. And she only got into L.A. last night. So she comes here the day after Cochran's press conference. Where is she now? Just walked into Fite Club. Oh, f*ck. Don't let her leave. I'm on my way. (music plays quietly, indistinct chatter) Can I help you? You're Terry Donovan. Yeah. Chuy Gomez, the Garden. 1995. A hell of a fight. You were there? My father was. Your father followed me? My father followed anyone who was white and made it more than five rounds. I'm working on a book about Sully Sullivan. So what's that got to do with me? Well, I'm looking for people who knew him in the old days. Your father's name came up. You know where I can find him? He's not here. You know where he is? No. Want to stick around, it's 20 bucks to train. (indistinct chatter) I'll get us a table. Yeah, go on in ahead. I'll be right in there. I'll just be a minute. Yes, sir. I met with him. Oh, yes! Oh, you didn't. Oh, my God! When and where? Nowhere. It's not gonna happen, Stu. What? Why? She's a professional. She only has s*x with other professionals. That's it? That's been the hang-up? Huh? She only f*cks on camera? That's the game they're playing? It's not a game, Stu. It's their business. You know the difference between you and me? No. You take "no" for an answer. I can handle this myself. These are dangerous people, Stu. Thank you, Ray. f*ck you. I don't need you anymore. I'm sure that public school is good enough for your little girl, Ray. Scott, I got some very good news. Just listen. There's something going on here, Bob. No. I'm staying with friends, no hotel bill. No, I can't leave yet. I'll call you. You all right? (scoffs) Some asshole blocked me in. Happens all the time. It's my brother's place. You're a Donovan? Yeah. I'm Ray. Come on upstairs. We'll sort it out. This whole Trousdale thing... it's not really our world. Why? Because one nosey c**t makes fun of your accent? It's a sign. No. "For Sale" is a sign. "In Escrow" is a sign. "Sold" is a sign. Do you think I was welcomed with open arms when I first got here? Come on. I was the mistress for 20 years. I don't know. Oh, f*ck the bitch. You'll buy the house, add a second story, and block her view. (both laugh) (cackling) (sighs) (indistinct shouting in distance) Man : Federal or state? (sighs) Walpole, Mass. 20 years. You? 35 years. A variety of institutions. Now I'm out on... compassionate release. I guess that's good, huh? Uh... pancreatic cancer. Oh. They didn't want to pay for the care. It's very expensive. Geez. That's a tough break. Mickey Donovan. Shorty. It’s a long story. Long Story Shorty. (laughs) I like it. (both laugh) You... you want some tools? I got some tools. You got a screwdriver? Let me see. (Mickey sighs) Let's see what you got. Yeah. (laughs) Oh! sh1t. It's a f*cking arsenal. Yeah. Duct tape. Good for everything. (sighs) Got a date tonight. Musso and Franks. Mm. Class. (groaning) (groaning) (monitor buzzes, Shorty laughs) (both laugh) Shorty... if I bring you back something to eat, will you keep this on your leg? Make it look like I'm still here? Grilled white fish, if they got it. No butter. Slice of lemon. (Laughs) Strap it on. (laughs) Strap it on. Then you can hold this, see? There. I'd have figured you for a steak kind of guy. Oh, you don't got the time to know what I used to be. It's working. Here we go. Here we go. Ready? Oh, yeah. (sighs) Done. (panting) (crying) (sniffling) I... Been a long time since a… stranger give me a kindness. (laughs) (Coughs) (loud coughing) You're not contagious, are you? 
 
 (indistinct chatter) You talk to her? She's writing a book about Sully and asking questions about the old man. I didn't say nothing. (music plays) (sighs) Apparently, the guy's, uh, in the shower. Should be out in a sec. I get you a Coke or something? Sure. My brother tells me you're, uh, writing a book about Sully Sullivan. That's right. Mm, and now that he's dead, guess you got your ending, huh? I wouldn't be here if I had my ending. Came to L.A. because this is where he died. Trying to talk to people who knew him, like your father. Pop never talks about the old days, so... I don't think he remembers 'em. I'd still like to talk to him. You always do this? What? Stand this close to people when you're talking to 'em? It's a trick I picked up. Yeah? Where? Journalism school. Oh, right. I can't meet with him? Even just ask him a few questions? He's old. You know? Fragile. Why drag him through all that stuff? There's the asshole that blocked you in. I'm really sorry. I'm moving the car now. (car horn honks in distance) (engine revs) Shorty? Yeah. You got any, uh, aftershave or men's cologne? For a job interview or a woman? A woman. I got nothing. (laughs) Do you think I'm a moron? Good question. I'm not competent to give a professional evaluation. Stand against the wall. Spread your legs. So now you're gonna tell me it just flew away, right? It just fell off, just like that. Things ain't made like they used to. Where is the monitor? Right here. I've been trying to fix it. (chuckles, coughing) Sit down. Ain't you never loved nobody? Shut the f*ck up. I'm assuming you have 'cause you're human. Listen, uh, I... I got to... I got to see Claudette tonight. There's no law against visitors. She can't see me like this. Done. There's no next time, Mickey. Nice watch. How'd you get it? Bought it. Where? Gem and Loan, pawnshop in Beverly Hills. How much you pay for it? No more questions, Donovan. I bet you paid a lot more than money for that watch, didn't you? Cost you a piece of your soul, right? Right? (beeping) Claudette, it's me. Listen, um... there's been a change of plans. I can't make it. I need to see you, Mick. It's important. (sighs) Honey, I don't want you to see me living like this. I don't care. What's the address? Look, if Pop and Sully had ever met, I'm sure I'd have known about it. Sounds like you two are close. Oh, yeah. He's my father. Well, if there's any way I could talk to him, even if there's one Sully story, I'd like to hear it. He's a tired old con. Sure, he made a lot of stupid mistakes, but he paid for 'em. We all did. Do me a favor, give him a break, all right? Thanks for your help, Ray. (engine starts) You signed a confidentiality agreement. Remember that, Scott. (sighs) Yes, Stu. What happens on Stage 6 stays on Stage 6. Yes, Stu. Hi. I'm Rod. Jesus, how did you score this set? I have connections, man. They want it back in an hour, so... Okay, Rod, do you have the money and, uh, health certificate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's your cameraman? I'm doing this P.O.V., you know, handheld. Smart. Okay. Let's get rolling, Lexi. (clears throat) Yeah. I've met a lot of stars, but... What's the scene? We're the last two people on Earth... and you're sucking my dick. Okay. Lexi : Ooh. Oh, yeah. (moaning) Ooh, yeah. Ooh, yeah. (moaning) Ooh, yeah. Ooh, yeah. (moaning) Ricky. Camera down! Hey! (grunts) (Shouts) Hey. (groans) What the f*ck are you doing, man? What the f*ck are you doing? I dropped the camera. No. You didn't drop the camera... you put the camera down. This is my wife. You're not making a movie. Oh, I'm not making a movie? No. I'm the biggest producer on this lot. You are? Really? Yes. This is my set. I'm f*cking Stu Feldman! I own this f*cking town! (grunts) He's buying me the house of my dreams. And he's getting Bridget into the best school in the city. Mmm. It's not easy for him. You saw that in one session... Ray's very proud. Yes. There's this guy that he has to deal with. He's a f*cking prick. Ray has to go to him and beg him for a favor. (chuckles) He has to swallow his pride. He's doing that for Bridget. (sniffling) Why are you crying, Abby? Instead of... being grateful for all the beautiful things he's doing for my family... I've been so selfish. Have you talked about the abuse? He's giving me so much. Why can't you see that? What did you just write? (sighs) Baby. Ray : Yeah. Yeah. Well, they knocked me out and threw me in the trunk of the car. Who did, Stu? Cut the sh1t, Ray. You knew this was gonna happen. Help me out and, uh, I will keep my promise. Just get me out of this, and Bridget goes to Bel Air. (whispers): Money. Ray, go to my safe and get 100... $200,000 and, uh, bring it to, uh... What's the address of this shithole? I know where you are. Amen, m*therf*cker. (gunfire) (grunting) (dramatic music playing) God, I love crap like this. I can't believe he's dead. Announcer : The Sean Walker marathon will continue  with Black Mass 2 up next. More wine? Mmhmm. But something different. I feel like... like action sequels are best with a pinot noir. I think sequels go better with beer. Amy, what does a consultant do on a movie? (grunts) Where is he? Why? Because you kidnapped my client. He put the camera down! Stu : Ray! He'd better be able to walk out of here. Dude... Oh, God. Hey. You ever do p0rn? This indie look is really in right now. It was... it was the testosterone. I mean, this is dangerous stuff. I mean, people need to know. Hi, this is Susanna Trane from Peet's Coffee. We have a program for hiring seniors, and one of your parolees, Michael Donovan, applied for a job here, but we don't have a current address for him. Uh-huh. (sighing) (grunts) (grunting) (panting) She's got a rich husband. Provides big-time. Palm Springs mansion. (sighs) Goddamn it. How did I end up here? (sighs) Women don't care about that. If they love you, they love you. Take a breath, man. (sighs) What? You don't want the money. You keep talking, and I have to start counting again. Do you want to stay here all night? You keep the money, you're a kidnapper. Big deal. You're a kidnapper, and you make your wife a whore. (scoffs) You don't want the money. No? What do I want? You ever get hit in the head while you were coming? Not unless I threw the first punch. (groans) You all right? Yeah. (sniffs) The bag looks heavy. Ray, is there still money in there? Is that my money? Take him back to the studio. All right. (starts engine) Why? Why are we... Why are we going back to the studio? I want to go home! Ray, I want to go home! I don't want to go to the studio! $200,000. Are you serious? What? I can't run that much cash through the gym, Ray. You need another shell. I keep telling you, diversify. We're moving to Trousdale, kids are going to private school. Trousdale? What is this, 1966 and you're Nancy f*cking Sinatra? Hey. George Hamilton called... he wants his bag back. The office just got a call from a woman at Peet's who said your father had applied for a job there and they want his address. Did you give it to 'em? No, I didn't. Lupita did. What the f*ck is going on? Get him out of there as fast as you can. All right. (crickets chirping) (phone chimes, buzzes) (scoffs) (doorbell rings) (loud knocking) (doorbell ringing) Shawty. Who the hell do you think you are? Hey, you don't know? I'm Marvin Gaye. Washington. Washington. Jesus, Marvin, what are you doing here? My dad will kill you. That nigga is crazy. But so am I. For you. You're hanging out with... supermodels and rock stars. You don't... need me. They ain't real. You're so full of sh1t, Marvin. I miss you, Bridg. (chuckles) You're following me? (sighs) My father's not coming home tonight. He's on house arrest. He has to come home sometime. Not tonight. What the f*ck are you so afraid of? You want to go get a drink? Come on. (reporter speaking indistinctly on television) Thank God you picked me up. God had nothing to do with it. (squeals) That was great! Director : f*cking... Ho, ho, ho! Cut! Cut! Who the f*ck is this asshole?! He's with me. Oh, okay. Okay. All right, Stu. That's... Okay. Let's, uh... Yeah, let's just... We'll spin it back. Let's do it again. All right. You stay at the table. You don't go to the bathroom. You have your dinner, you pay your bill and you come right back to the car, you understand? Are those your conditions or Ray's? I guess you done moved on up to the big house now. Man, shut your f*cking mouth. I'm doing you a f*cking favor. Claudette. There she is. That woman is the mother of your child? She's the love of my life. Claudette! (car door shuts) I'll be damned. Mm, mm, mm. (sighs) (indistinct chatter) (dance music playing) (phone ringing) Yeah? I told you to take care of her, not take her on a date. When is she going back to Boston, Ray? You'll know when I do. You ready? Yeah. Woman : Why was apprehending Sully Sullivan such a priority for you? Sully Sullivan was responsible for 20 people being dead. That's terrorism. Isn't that a bit of a leap? Calling Sully Sullivan a terrorist? Fear is fear. Terrorism is terrorism. Sullivan was a domestic terrorist. For me, my first thought in the morning, my last thought at night is how can I protect Americans from fear. That's my job. Announcer (on television) : Coming up next, the Internet... is it dangerous? Is it real? Is it perpetuating a myth... ? You didn't tell me your father was a consultant on Black Mass. Consultant? The only thing my father did on that movie was to keep half of Southie from walking off with all the lights and cameras. And those people were Sully and his friends? Sully didn't have friends. You either worked for him or you didn't. If you didn't, you were an enemy. So you were an enemy. I knew enough to keep my distance. Well, that's pretty smart for a boy from Southie. What do you know about Southie? I'm writing a book about it. No, you're not. You're writing a book about Sully Sullivan. A book about Sully is a book about Southie. Is it? Mm. You don't think I know what I'm doing. I'm not sure yet. When I first came here, I didn't think I had sh1t. Just a hunch. What do you got now? (sighs) Well, Cochran won't let me talk to Frank Barnes. You won't let me talk to your father. There's a story here, or you guys wouldn't be trying so hard to keep me from it. (laughs) You want another drink? Yeah. You want another drink. I'm sorry for all the to and fro today. I had a bit of a situation. Me, too. I was at the Beverly Hills Police Department. They called me in. What'd they want? I had to sign a sworn statement about where I was the night that Sean Walker died. I swore that I was with you. Good. (chuckles) This is the second time. They are not giving up on this. Aw, geez. Claudette, I'm sorry I dragged you into this mess. Well, dragged me into what exactly? What happened that evening? Were you involved? It wasn't me who killed him. It was Sully. So, why do you need me? After this long, do I have to tell you why I need you? I've always needed you. I love you. I love you, too. But I'm worried. I did what you asked. Now, what else do I have to be worried about? Nothing. (quiet laugh) (laughs) What was Japan like? Mostly I saw the hotel. But, uh, the shows, they was wild. Japanese kids knew the English words to my song. Wrote it in Compton and they're singing it in Tokyo. How do I know... They teach Japanese at the school I'm going to next year. Shawty, instead of taking Japanese here, why not just go there with me? (laughs) (door opens) (door closes) Anybody home? Conor? Bridg? Ray? (sighs) Kate : So, what about you? You married? Yeah. How many times? One. You got kids? Two. Boy and a girl. How old? Boy's 13. Girl's 15. She's a lot like you actually. (laughs) How? Smart. Miss Smarty Pants. She's your favorite. I didn't say that. Daddy's girl. Well. She just got in the best private school in the city. Private school in Los Angeles. Wow. That’s a long way from Dorchester Avenue. How'd you manage that? I don't know. Hard work, dedication. (laughs) How'd you get where you are? (smacks lips) I don't let anyone stop me. I mean, they always try, but I know when I got something. I don't care if it's a cardinal in Boston or the head of the FBI in Los Angeles. I know. I know. You know, huh? Mm-hmm. Tell me something. What do you know? The FBI said Sully was here for six months. It's not true. I got proof. Really? Yeah, really. They're hiding his girlfriend. Or she's dead. They think they can keep that from me. And you... you're hiding something from me. You know what Sully would've said about you? Kate McPherson. You're a real pisser, you know that? Ray Donovan? You're a real pisser, too. (laughs)
