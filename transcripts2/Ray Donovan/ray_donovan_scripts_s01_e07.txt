 Is that your boyfriend? 
 I think so. 
 Hey, Mr. Donovan. 
 Hey, you buy me yet? 
 Remember that kid we bought? 
 His mom must have shot off at the mouth. 
 You promised me this wouldn't come back. 
 You promised me. 
 Sean shot the girl with your gun, high on your drugs. 
 Ray said you were in trouble anyway. 
 You'd stolen a lot of money from Sully. 
 Sean Walker really killed that girl, huh? 
 Avi : Mickey's met with him a couple of times since Palm Springs. 
 You seem a little under the weather. 
 Hey, Ray. 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Hey! 
 If you think he's after you, he probably is. 
 You think you're the first person that tried to shut us down, you dumb f*ck? 
 I told you everything. 
 I told you! 
 Who the f*ck are you, Ray? 
 Woman : Is he a good husband? 
 How do you mean? 
 Men are naturally really secretive animals. 
 You never told me how Bridget died. 
 Ray : She was high on drugs. 
 She jumped off a roof. 
 Daddy, please stop it! 
 You might have the balls to put me away, kid. 
 But shoot me? 
 I don't think so. 
 Abby : Ray, are you up here? 
 Where you going now? 
 Boston. 
 Boston? 
 Why the f*ck are you going to Boston? 
 You pull a gun on your father, in front of your children and then you pack your sh1t and leave? 
 It's business. 
 You won't even let me take the kids home to see my parents and now all of a sudden you're going back? 
 Is this about Colleen? 
 For Christ's sakes, Abby, she's been dead for twenty years. 
 Then why are you going back? 
 I got to see someone. 
 But you won't tell me who? 
 What the hell is a "Steam Punk Wizard of Oz?" 
 It's the Wizard of Oz set in the world of Victorian England, where everything's steam powered and industrialized. 
 Sounds stupid. 
 Why are you all of a sudden interested in doing musicals? 
 I thought you hated that sh1t. 
 Morning. 
 So, what are you guys doing today? 
 Well, Bridget's auditioning for this dumb play and I've got soccer. 
 Huh? Sounds like a good day. 
 (Door opening) 
 You f*cking knew? 
 You knew my moms was killed and you ain't tell me! 
 All right, all right. Calm down. 
 Let's go outside. 
 She was murdered in our own house. 
 Ray! 
 Out, right now. 
 f*ck you, man! 
 You knew! 
 Daddy! 
 Stay there, Bridget. 
 Abby : Bridget, just wait. 
 Hold on. 
 Ray... 
 Get the f*ck off me! 
 Mom, stop! 
 No! 
 What the f*ck is this? 
 You bring a gun to my house? 
 You should have told me. 
 Shut up and keep walking. 
 Are you f*cking crazy? 
 Man, what were you thinking? 
 (Sighing) 
 Yo, I'm sorry about that, man. 
 He got a text from his little cousin about his mom. 
 I mean, dead bodies in the house for days? 
 That's just nasty. 
 Yo, you do that? 
 Are you out of your f*cking mind? 
 Hey, look, my bad. 
 I'm just wondering. 
 You keep that kid away from my daughter, you hear me? 
 All right. 
 Where you going? 
 To talk to Marvin. 
 No, you're not. 
 You can't just order me to not... 
 You stay away from him, you understand me? 
 You want to explain what the hell that kid was talking about? 
 It's nothing. 
 He's just upset. 
 He said his mother was murdered, said you knew something about it. 
 It's got nothing to do with us, Abs. 
 Really? 
 You're scaring me, Ray. 
 The way you've been, you're f*cking scaring me. 
 Come on, Abs. 
 (Sighing) 
 See you in a few days. 
 (Phone ringing and people chattering distantly) 
 Hey. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yes. 
 Have a seat. 
 You did some work on... 
 Ezra Goldman and Lee Drexler a couple of years ago. 
 Yeah. I couldn't get it to stick. 
 Crafty guys. 
 Wiretapping, extortion, jury tampering. 
 Criminal justice terrorists. 
 I want to bring some new evidence to Brady, see if I can get funded. 
 Okay. What do you got? 
 Murder... involving Sean Walker. 
 Sean f*cking Walker? 
 Are you serious? 
 I have evidence that he shot a girl in Boston twenty years ago and Ezra Goldman and Ray Donovan covered it up. 
 Wow. 
 I'm in. 
 Avi : The feds been looking for him for twenty years, Ray. 
 You think you can just fly to Boston and find him? 
 Why don't you let me take care of Mick? 
 Because I need you on the outside, not in prison. 
 You know, rumour is... he's in Belfast. 
 Sully didn't go to f*cking Ireland. 
 He's a ghost, Ray. 
 You're chasing a f*cking ghost. 
 Story of my life. 
 Even if you do find him, what? 
 Thanks for the ride. 
 Be careful out there. 
 Woman on P.A. : The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. 
 Amen, m*therf*cker. 
 (Gun firing) 
 "Amen, m*therf*cker." 
 (Laughing) 
 I f*cking love that line. 
 Shh! 
 (Crowd applauding) 
 (Whistling) 
 (Phone ringing, woman on P.A. chattering) 
 (Phone ringing) 
 What'd you find out? 
 Frank : You're right about Van. 
 Ray : What's he got? 
 Says he found a witness to testify to a cover up of the murder. 
 Says he could take down you, Ezra and Sean Walker. 
 What do you want me to do about it? 
 Try to sit on it until I get back in town. 
 Damn, Mickey Donovan. 
 That's my name. 
 Right there, "consultant." 
 (Applauding) 
 Black Mass, this minor masterpiece of the nineties action oeuvre, laid the groundwork for such films as Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Fincher's Seven. 
 It was also the film, as we know, that introduced the world to the great talent of our guest of honour this evening, Sean Walker! 
 Hey, Sean! 
 Sean! Hey, Sean! 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Be right back! 
 I'll be right back! 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Yeah. 
 Sean : It's me. 
 Your father's stalking me. 
 What? 
 He's at my screening, screaming my name from the third row. 
 Ray : You got a bodyguard there? 
 Bodyguard, what's that gonna do? 
 Just don't get near him. 
 You know, I'm sick of this sh1t. 
 You keep saying you're going to handle this. 
 Nothing f*cking happens! 
 I am handling. 
 What the hell... 
 Do you know how many times you have said that? 
 He's a harmless old man. 
 He likes movies. 
 What can I tell you? 
 You know what? 
 You're f*cking fired. 
 Don't do that. 
 I am one of the most important people on this planet. 
 I can deal with this on my own, Ray. 
 Don't get any stupid ideas, Sean. 
 You're not a character in one of your movies. 
 Asshole. 
 Are you ready, Sean? 
 (Sniffing) 
 (Applauding) 
 Sorry about that. 
 They had to stick the mic on. 
 All right. All right. 
 Uh, let's start with questions. 
 Uh, yes, you in the glasses. 
 Yes. 
 Thanks. 
 Hi, hi. My name is Sam. 
 I'm a very huge fan of everything you do and I love your work so much... 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm a great fan too. 
 I'm a big fan and I got an idea for a movie you should do. 
 It's about an unknown actor, who comes to Boston to act in a film and he ends up shooting a young woman in the head. 
 And then he frames a working Joe from an honest family for the murder. 
 Sounds interesting. 
 Yeah, I ain't done yet. 
 You see, this honest family man, he goes to jail for twenty years and the young actor, he becomes the biggest movie star in the world. 
 What do you think? 
 It sounds, uh, a bit... 
 You want to buy it? 
 I actually don't buy pictures. 
 Man : Buy it! 
 Yeah, buy it. 
 Buy it, buy it! 
 Crowd : Buy it! Buy it! 
 Buy it! Buy it! 
 Buy it! Buy it! 
 Okay, okay. 
 You're very convincing. 
 All right, I'm going to give you my number. 
 Alright. Sam. 
 Sam : Um... Yes. 
 Black Mass... Christian undertones, religious, all that good stuff... 
 Did you study with the Catholic Church? 
 Did you do anything with the priesthood? 
 (Knocking) 
 Hi. 
 What you want? 
 About your mom, I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. 
 It's a terrible thing. 
 Were you close? 
 She was my mom. 
 Look, if you ever need to talk... 
 I know you don't know me so well, but if you need to talk... 
 I'm here. 
 She was a drug addict. 
 Couldn't raise me herself, so she sold me. 
 You know, she probably bragged about all the cash she got, someone killed her for it. 
 What does my husband have to do with that? 
 Ask him yourself. 
 (Rock music playing) 
 Sit down, Eddie. 
 I don't know what happened. 
 I picked Mickey out of that line-up, just like I told you. 
 If it's the money you're after, it's gone. 
 I gave it to my mother, surgery, macular degeneration. 
 Relax. 
 I'm here to see Sully. 
 Sully? Sully died ten years ago, in Belfast. 
 Just tell him I'm here. 
 Hey, Ray. 
 Remember me? 
 No. 
 Yo, you want to make some music? 
 You want to order some sushi? 
 I'll tell you what, hit that. 
 That's gonna make you feel better. 
 (Sucking teeth) 
 You know what? We gonna throw you a party tomorrow. 
 Why? 
 Celebrate your birthday. 
 Ain't my birthday tomorrow. 
 It's your new birthday, son. 
 You got a whole new life ahead of you. 
 So, cheer up. 
 We partying tomorrow. 
 Announcer on TV : Halfway through the tenth round now. 
 Both fighters are beginning to show... 
 Yo, this kid can f*cking fight. 
 He's just a puncher. 
 What are you talking about? 
 He's a beast. 
 He ain't no real boxer, that's for sure. 
 But you don't know the difference. 
 I know the difference. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 You think because you lifted weights and played football in high school, you're some type of tough guy. 
 Young man : I'm learning, Pa. 
 Who is this? 
 Man : I'm sending a car for you tomorrow at 11 o'clock. 
 Who is this? 
 Sean Walker. 
 Make it 11:30. 
 I'm drinking tonight. 
 Okay, that should work. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Christ! 
 I'm sleeping over here. 
 Oh, you're sleeping. 
 Oh... 
 You've got a perfectly fine house. 
 Why ain't you sleeping over there? 
 I don't like it no more. 
 You don't like it no more. 
 That's all right, it's just a house. 
 Stop it, Pa! f*ck! Stop! 
 Oh! 
 Come on. 
 Get up, get up. 
 (Groaning) 
 Join the land of the living, boy. 
 (Groaning) 
 Get up, up you go. 
 Hey! Let's go over there. 
 Boxers ain't f*cking tough guys. 
 They're f*cking stooges of the sport. 
 You don't like me, huh? 
 Was I hiding that fact from you? 
 Hey, Terry. 
 Where's that pretty lady you've been hanging out with? 
 I haven't seen her in awhile. 
 She's busy. 
 That's a puncher. 
 I'm serious! 
 Announcer : He's already celebrating. 
 Look at him! 
 (Phone ringing) 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
 You okay? 
 What was Marvin talking about, Daddy? 
 Did you buy him? 
 It's not like that. 
 But you knew his mother was dead. 
 Yeah. 
 Why wouldn't you tell him? 
 Listen, sweetheart. 
 I was trying to help. 
 Get him out of a house full of drug addicts. 
 So you gave money to his mother to give him to Re-Kon? 
 People who live like that, die like that, Bridge. 
 I did my best to help his mother too. 
 It just didn't work out. 
 But... 
 I did my best, Bridge. 
 Do you want to talk to Mom? 
 No. I'll talk to her tomorrow. 
 How was school? 
 It was fine. 
 Goodnight, Daddy. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Yeah? 
 Eddie : Flannigan's. 
 When? 
 Now. 
 Eddie : He's back there. 
 Hey, Ray. 
 (Grunting) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Yelling) 
 (Grunting) 
 My f*cking nose! 
 (Grunting) 
 You remember me now? 
 No. 
 That it? 
 You done? 
 Get the f*ck out of town. 
 Ah... 
 Ah! 
 (Coughing) 
 Fat guy : Son of a bitch. 
 Tell Sully I want to see him. 
 You're a f*cking lunatic, Ray. 
 I told you, he ain't in Boston. 
 I thought you said he was dead. 
 (Sighing) 
 (Knocking) 
 I know what you're thinking. 
 What am I thinking? 
 That you can only recognize me if you squint. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm in a fat suit, huh? 
 Old Gary in a fat suit. 
 Shut the f*ck up, Gary. 
 Come here. 
 Good to see you, Ray. 
 How you doing? 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Come on in. 
 Thanks. 
 (Whistling) 
 You want a drink? 
 Sure. 
 Ice? 
 Nah. 
 Surprised to get your call, Ray. 
 Didn't think you came back to Boston anymore. 
 I don't. 
 What's the occasion? 
 I just got a little business. 
 What's your line of work now, Ray? 
 I consult. 
 Sláinte. 
 You got a wife and kids now, huh? 
 Four f*cking teenage boys. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 (Both chuckling) 
 What's your wife's name again? 
 Gloria. 
 You don't know her. 
 Where'd you meet her? 
 She was the secretary down at the yard. 
 She know about Bridget? 
 f*ck. Ray... 
 Let me ask you something, Gar. 
 Bridget ever talk to you about my father? 
 What do you mean? 
 I don't know. 
 What kind of dad he was? 
 I don't f*cking remember. 
 So, why do you think she did it? 
 Come on, Ray. 
 It was 25 years ago. 
 No idea, huh? 
 Look, we were f*cking high all the time. 
 That's why you wanted to talk? 
 f*ck, Ray. 
 I can't look back at it no more. 
 I mean, the Pats, the Red Sox, you want to shoot the sh1t about hockey or something? 
 But Bridget... sh1t ain't got no answer. 
 You think? 
 I know. 
 (Breathing deeply) 
 I'm so f*cking tired, Gary. 
 Okay. 
 You don't have to do that, Ray. 
 It's for your kids. 
 My boy's never been to Fenway. 
 Take yours. 
 Thanks. 
 Be safe, all right? 
 See you, Gar. 
 Take it easy, Ray. 
 f*cking Boston.

 Hi, Mrs. Sullivan. 
 Take my arm. 
 Okay, let's go.

 You ain't supposed to be here. 
 I know. 
 Your dad thinks I'm gonna be a bad influence on you. 
 My dad's the bad influence. 
 Well, you're suddenly in a good mood. 
 It's my birthday. 
 Wait. I thought you were a Virgo. 
 I used to be. 
 (Chuckling) 
 Now I got a new life and a new birthday. 
 Come on, shawty. 
 Laying down some tracks. 
 Okay, sure. 
 (Indistinct chattering) 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 How are you, Mrs. Sullivan? 
 How's Sully keeping these days? 
 Tiny, who's this? 
 I'm Ray Donovan, ma'am. 
 Mickey's boy. 
 Mickey, that prick. 
 Sleeps with a nigger while his beautiful wife was dying. 
 That's him. 
 Tell Sully I want to see him, all right? 
 Go f*ck yourself. 
 Charming as ever, Mrs. Sullivan. 
 Come on... 
 (Groaning) 
 You tell Sully I got something for him. 
 You tell him I'm not leaving until he talks to me. 
 All right? 
 (Groaning) 
 Take care, Mrs. Sullivan. 
 (Door opening) 
 (Door closing) 
 Let's, um... 
 Let's look at some options. 
 All right. 
 Oh, my God. 
 They're so beautiful. 
 Price range going to work? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe Ray has more than he lets on. 
 You think moving is going to change anything? 
 Maybe if we move into town he'll get rid of that weird apartment. 
 God, that f*cking place. 
 I decorated it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (Laughing) 
 I found a handcuff. 
 A handcuff? 
 You think they torture people there? 
 You mean people other than us? 
 I'm so lonely in Calabasas. 
 Oh, sweetheart. 
 I've been lonely 20 years. 
 Everyone's lonely. 
 In Ray's apartment, that huge photo of Marilyn Monroe. 
 Why is that art? 
 It's about celebrity and deconstructing the myth of fame. 
 God, I'm so full of sh1t. 
 (Laughing) 
 I need another drink. 
 Me too. Waiter? 
 (Barking) 
 Abby : So Ray went to Boston yesterday. 
 So? 
 He hates it there. 
 He won't even let me go back. 
 I mean, our kids have never been. 
 So, why do you think he went? 
 Something to do with his father. 
 Oh. 
 You know, I met him the other day. 
 He came to the house. 
 Charming. 
 Ray hates him. 
 (Scoffing) 
 You know he killed Ray's girlfriend, right? 
 I heard that. 
 Ray started f*cking her after my parents made me break up with him. 
 They were mortified that I was with a Donovan. 
 Wouldn't let me out of the house. 
 So Ray took up with this girl, Colleen. 
 And Mickey killed her? 
 That's why Ray hates him. 
 Sometimes I think Ray's still obsessed with that dead girl. 
 Please. Guess what Ezra named the dog. 
 What? 
 Ruth. 
 No! 
 I swear to God. 
 (Both laughing) 
 It's not even a girl dog. 
 I know. 
 And for such a little thing, it's got a huge dick. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Ruth. 
 Ruth's got a big dick. 
 (Laughing) 
 It's okay. 
 (Cooing) 
 Raymond. 
 Sully. 
 Heard you got your own family now. 
 Son, daughter. 
 Now thanks to your prick father, I don't got no family left. 
 He ratted them all out. 
 Yeah. 
 That's what he does. 
 They all went to prison. 
 My son Jamie got stabbed. 
 My brother Robbie got the f*cking AIDS. 
 Yeah, I was sorry to hear about that. 
 No. Enough sad stories. 
 Come on. Sit down. 
 What are you doing here? 
 (Groaning) 
 I came to see you. 
 Clearly. You ran through the f*cking gauntlet. 
 (Laughing) 
 Yeah. 
 Visited with my mother. 
 Oh, she's a treasure, Sully. 
 Don't be a f*cking wiseass. 
 What are you doing here, Ray? 
 I want you to kill my father. 
 (Laughing) 
 (Laughing): f*cking... Jeez. 
 I thought my family was f*cking screwed up. 
 You been to a post office lately, Ray? 
 I'm the FBI's most wanted. 
 Still number f*cking one. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Yeah, so what? 
 You're going to bring your f*cking father to me and let me finish the job? 
 No. 
 I was thinking I'd bring you out to Los Angeles. 
 You ever been? 
 Been anywhere in the last 20 years? 
 What do you think? 
 I haven't been to the dentist in 20 f*cking years. 
 I think you'll like it. 
 Come over. 
 Get a little sun. 
 Do a little job. 
 And after that, you can pick your next stop. 
 Keep talking. 
 I can set you up wherever you want to go. 
 Dubai, Maldives, Vietnam. 
 None of those places extradite. 
 I ain't going to f*cking Dubai to sit around with a bunch of towel heads. 
 Okay. f*ck Dubai. 
 No, because where I want to f*cking go is not going to be cheap. 
 All right. 
 Why don't you do it yourself? 
 I would, if I could. 
 (Sighing) 
 Why me, Raymond? 
 I guess because I want the last person he sees to hate him as much as I do. 
 (Door opening) 
 Woman : Will you come out here and walk the dog? 
 I can't get him to make. 
 He'll only make with you. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Pay your respects to that dead girl. 
 She was your f*cking girlfriend. 
 Yeah. 
 (Doors closing) 
 Mickey : Too f*cking bad about Rock Hudson. 
 Sean : What? 
 Mickey : Did some good movies. 
 Pillow Talk. 
 f*cking great. 
 But that Doris Day did not do it for me. 
 It should have been Lena Horne in Doris Day's part. 
 Or Eartha Kitt. 
 Who? 
 What's the matter with you? 
 You don't know who Eartha Kitt is? 
 No. 
 Man : Hey, Sean, how you doing? 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 That guy's such a f*cking cocksucker. 
 Now Mickey, listen. 
 You got to understand something. 
 If I buy this story, I own it. 
 It's an exclusive deal. 
 You cannot share this with anyone. 
 I got it. 
 But I think you got more than one movie in you. 
 You better believe it. 
 (Laughing) 
 (All shouting indistinctly) 
 Guard : Ladies, please step back. 
 Curtis, it's all right. 
 They're just little girls. 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Just over here, girls. 
 What is it? 
 I've got a job for you. 
 What now? 
 I need you to come in. 
 Sure, sure. I'm on my way. 
 Be there soon. 
 (Girls shouting in Japanese) 
 (Camera shutters clicking) 
 (All chattering) 
 Hey. Hey, bye-bye. 
 (Speaking Japanese) 
 (Laughing) 
 So, thinking this deal, we should make it an overall deal. 
 What do you think? 
 Sounds good. 
 Sounds real good.

 (Laughing) 
 That's cool. 
 Abby : You know, Ray actually likes nice things. 
 Nice clothes. 
 Where we're from, men aren't supposed to dress like that. 
 I think it's sexy. 
 Excuse me. 
 f*cking Ray. 
 I hate him all day, and when I'm drunk all I do is think about him. 
 Woman : Here you are. 
 Thank you. 
 That's $5,000. 
 Doesn't Ray buy you things? 
 Yeah. 
 But it's never the right thing. 
 Mmm. 
 Oh, just buy them. 
 They look great on you. 
 No. 
 Come on. 
 I used to do this all the time when I was a kid. 
 Abby. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Ma'am? 
 Go, go, go! 
 sh1t. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Guard : Ladies, get back here. 
 Oh, my God. Hurry. 
 sh1t. 
 Guard : Hey! 
 Come on. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Get the f*ck up. 
 Get the Manolos. 
 (Laughing) 
 Come on. 
 I can't. 
 Wait a minute. 
 I think I'm may have peed my pants. 
 (Both laughing) 
 Oh, my God. 
 I peed! 
 (Both cackling) 
 Hey, Van, listen. 
 Before we take this upstairs, I think we should go over your files. 
 You know, maybe let me take home what you got so I can get familiar. 
 I'd rather keep them in my safe. 
 All right, then at least give me the tapes. 
 I'd rather not. 
 Van, if you can't trust me with your evidence, how can I help you? 
 Who are you working for, Frank? 
 What? 
 Who are you working for, Frank? 
 The FBI, Van. 
 Does Donovan have something on you? 
 You know, that sounds a little paranoid. 
 I'm not paranoid. 
 Really? 
 I saw you downstairs the other day. 
 You were acting really strange. 
 I'm on antihistamines. 
 Uh-huh. 
 All right, you don't want my help? 
 You go it alone. 
 Just trying to lend a hand. 
 I have allergies!

 Damn, you sing good as sh1t, for a white girl. 
 Really? 
 Hell, yeah. 
 White girl? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 (Laughing) 
 sh1t. 
 (Sighing) 
 You're so incredible. 
 You're so talented. 
 I love you. 
 Sit down, Bridge. 
 Come on. 
 (Laughing) 
 Hey. 
 Where have you been, Mickey? 
 I had a little business thing. 
 What business? 
 My business. 
 Look, fun and games are over. 
 I'm wiring you up. 
 You're going to get in there and get a confession out of Sean Walker. 
 How am I going to get close to a guy like that? 
 I have faith in you. 
 Going to need a lot more money. 
 I'm tired of these conversations, Mickey. 
 You owe me more than what you've given. 
 Money isn't a part of this anymore. 
 Now, you're going to get that confession or you're going back to Walpole. 
 (Punches landing) 
 Man : Jab. Double jab. 
 Move back. 
 Clear the gym. 
 Clear the gym. 
 We're closing early. 
 We're closing early. 
 Hey. 
 I'm working, Mick. 
 Hey, get dressed. 
 Take the jock clothes off. 
 You too. You too. 
 We're all going out to celebrate. 
 What are we celebrating? 
 I'm back in the movie business. 
 (Laughing) 
 (Imitating train chugging) 
 Off the tracks. 
 They can't stop me now. 
 (Imitating train whistle blowing) 
 Here he comes. 
 (Phone line ringing) 
 (Sighing) 
 Sean : Hello? 
 Did you talk to my father? 
 I don't have to answer to you, Ray. 
 Did you talk to him? 
 No, Ray. 
 I didn't. 
 Ray, you there? 
 You're f*cking lying to me, Sean. 
 Ray, listen. 
 Have it your way. 
 You're digging your own grave. 
 (Line disconnecting) 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Yeah? 
 Frank, over phone : Van Miller's off the reservation. 
 There's nothing I can do about him now. 
 Please, Ray, cut me some slack. 
 I swear I did everything I could. 
 All right. 
 Wait in your office. 
 I'm sending something over now. 
 (Belt buckle clacking) 
 (Sighing) 
 (Zipper rasping) 
 (Sighing) 
 I'm sorry. Marvin. 
 I'm not ready. 
 My moms got murder because the money your dad gave her to buy me. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Marvin. 
 Marvin, I... I can't. 
 Pipe me, bitch. 
 Marvin... 
 Pipe me! 
 Marvin, I'm sorry. 
 Come on. 
 Marvin! 
 Just do it! 
 You asshole! 
 (Sobbing) 
 I got to make decisions sometimes too. 
 Okay. 
 It's not just you doing what you want all the time. 
 You hear me? 
 Ray? 
 Let me see those shoes again. 
 (Laughing) 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 Including the fine, those are going to cost me about $6,000. 
 Good. 
 Better be worth it. 
 You still drunk? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 Good. 
 (Beeping) 
 Now touch your nose. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 That's... That's right. 
 All right, put your arm down. 
 That's good. 
 Now, I need... 
 Arms, both... 
 Arms down. 
 Raise your right leg straight... 
 Sir, turn and face me. 
 I've been so bad tonight. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 You think so? 
 I know so. 
 And I'm not sorry about it either. 
 You're not, huh? 
 No. 
 Neither am I. 
 What is it? 
 (Groaning) 
 Huh? 
 Broken rib, I think. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Let me put something on it. 
 Okay. 
 (Bottle opening) 
 Hi. 
 (Sighing) 
 How's it going, kiddo? 
 Good. 
 Where's your sister? 
 She's upstairs. 
 Something's wrong with her. 
 What do you mean? 
 She came home from Marvin's house all screwed up. 
 Something happened. 
 What happened? 
 It was nothing. 
 What did he do to you? 
 He attacked her, Ray. 
 It was my fault. 
 He didn't mean it. 
 What did he do? 
 He just got carried away. 
 Don't hurt him. 
 It's your fault. 
 You lied to him. 
 You're a liar. 
 You don't help people. 
 You hurt people. 
 I hate you! 
 What is he going to do, Mom? 
 (Crying) 
 Yo, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean it. 
 He's going to kill him. 
 Mom. 
 Come away from the window. 
 Mom. 
 Come away. 
 (Car door closing) 
 (Ignition starting) 
 (Tires screeching) 
 (Vehicle pulling away) 
 I'm leaving, Mother. 
 I know, Patrick. 
 (Sighing) 
 (Sighing) 
 Where are you taking me? 
 I didn't mean to hurt her, Mr. Donovan. I swear. 
 I didn't mean to hurt her. 
 Today's my birthday, Mr. Donovan. 
 Please. 
 It's my new birthday.
