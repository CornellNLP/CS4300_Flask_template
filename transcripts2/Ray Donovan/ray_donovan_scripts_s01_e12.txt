 (gunshot) 
 Frank :  Van is dead. 
 You f*cking murdered an FBI agent. 
 I want you to kill my father. 
 Why me, Raymond? 
 'Cause I want the last person he sees to hate him as much as I do. 
 It's all there. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 Ruth's foundation. 
 Sully just called. 
 It's been done. 
 Ray :  I'll get your money. 
 You got the wrong guy, pal. 
 What are you talking about? 
 And I can prove it. 
 Seany boy, are you in there? 
 Let me in. 
 Mickey, please, help me. 
 I can't, kid. 
 (gunshot) 
 What happened, Raymond? 
 Sully. 
 And Mickey's still alive. 
 Ruth's money? 
 Gone. 
 We've unleashed a monster. 
 He doesn't have a passport. I'll find him. 
 Do you think Sully's coming for us? 
 I'm going into town. 
 You take care of the kids. 
 I can't let you do that. 
 Are we in danger? 
 Bunchy :  Remember me? 
 It's Brendan. 
 We don't know each other. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Are you? 
 Ray : What'd you do? 
 It was an accident. 
 What the f*ck? 
 I need help. 
 Bunchy shot him. 
 He won't take me to the hospital. 
 They don't know, do they? 
 Shut up. 
 You never told them. 
 I told you to shut up. 
 I loved you. 
 Frances :  So you took him to the hospital? 
 Yeah. 
 Which hospital? 
 I had Avi take the kids to a hotel. 
 Okay. Ray, that priest-- what happened? 
 Is that the one that abused Bunchy? 
 Wasn't only Bunch. 
 No. No, no. 
 Don't touch me.

 Where's Sully? 
 I... I don't know. 
 (groaning) 
 It's all right. 
 He knows CPR. 
 Where's Sully, Eddie? 
 Avi : He knows what he's doing. 
 Santa Monica. 
 Where? 
 I don't know. 
 (groans) 
 My God, I'm dying here. 
 Tell me how to find him, and I'll stop. 
 Uh, all you can eat. 
 (groans) 
 What? 
 Avi : Everything's okay. 
 Tiny. 
 All you can eat. 
 Third Street. 
 Man : Yeah, I see him. 
 Avi : Everybody back, thank you. 
 Okay, folks, stand back. 
 Be smart, keep your mouth shut, and we'll take care of you. 
 (panting) 
 Don't say anything, Raymond. 
 (sighs) I waited all night for you to come arrest me, Frank. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I thought you might need your lawyer, m*therf*cker. 
 Van was a good agent. 
 A good American. 
 All right. 
 (sighs) 
 Let's go. 
 You're not gonna bring me in, Frank. 
 'Cause you know I didn't do it. 
 You think I'd leave a body? 
 You think I'm that stupid? 
 I don't leave f*cking evidence. 
 That's not admissible. 
 You haven't Mirandized him. 
 You pursue this, you're gonna look like an asshole, and you're gonna lose your pension. 
 You want to be an asshole with no pension, that's fine with me, Frank, but who's gonna support those kids of yours? 
 Do not f*cking do this to me, Ray. 
 I think you're gonna give me 12 hours, 'cause you know I'm telling the truth. 
 (sighs) 
 You're making the right decision, Frank. 
 12 hours. 
 You all right? 
 Thought I'd feel real bad after what happened to Father Danny. 
 But I don't. 
 I'm glad he's gone. 
 That way, he can't do it to anyone else. 
 That's right, Bunch. 
 I'm gonna stay at my apartment from now on. 
 Good. 
 Won't be mad? 
 No. Course not. 
 But you change your mind, you're welcome here any time, you know that. 
 Thanks, Ter. 
 (waves sloshing) 
 You are taking advantage. 
 Who do you think is gonna pay for all of this? 
 Dad? 
 Dad's not here, Conor. 
 You're gonna make yourself sick. 
 Plus, you're not even hungry, you're sad. 
 Bullshit. Sad about what? 
 Mom and Dad. 
 Why? 
 Mom's upset, Dad's gone. 
 Uh, we're staying in a hotel, we're missing school. 
 So what? 
 I don't even like school. 
 If I was in Israel, I'd be in the army right now. 
 You are clueless. 
 (scoffs) 
 Mommy? 
 Come on, it's time to get up. 
 Mom? 
 Leave me alone, Bridget. 
 Where's Dad? 
 I don't know. 
 When are we going home? 
 Mom, you should get up. 
 Leave me alone! 
 (sighs) 
 (sniffles) 
 Lena : You write that one down? 
 3832 Wilshire Blvd? 
 Did you find the "all you can eat" yet? 
 We're working on it. 
 How hard can it be? 
 Boss, there's a bunch of 'em. 
 So narrow it down. 
 Show his f*cking picture. 
 The guy weighs 300 pounds, for Christ's sake. 
 Everybody who eats in these places weighs 300 pounds. 
 We're running out of time, all right? 
 Okay. All right, look, we're going now. 
 We just had to collect all the names. 
 Maybe he meant Third Street in Hollywood. 
 No, they stayed in Santa Monica. 
 He hides in plain sight. 
 That's how he did it in Boston. 
 He doesn't run, he doesn't go far. 
 Okay. 
 We will, Ray. 
 I'll meet you downstairs. 
 Yeah. 
 You want me to check on your family? 
 No, they're all right. 
 Did you call Abby? 
 What are you, my f*cking marriage counselor? 
 Go out there and do your f*cking job! 
 (door slams) 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 This is not appropriate for me. 
 I'm a sexual anorexic. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Enough with that sh1t. 
 Jesus. 
 What the hell? 
 You know what, Pop? 
 I don't want you here no more. 
 I want my place back. 
 Really? 
 We have good times, don't we, Bunch? 
 I thought we were having fun being together. 
 All right, you know what? 
 You take the bed, have your privacy, you're right. 
 I can move back out to the couch. 
 No. 
 I want to live alone. 
 Like a grown-up. 
 I see. 
 Well, just be careful you don't burn it down. 
 See? That's what I'm talking about. 
 Why you got to bring that up? 
 It's just a bolt out of the f*cking blue, that's all. 
 I told you Father Danny was here. 
 You should have listened to me. 
 This... this wouldn't have happened. 
 What wouldn't have happened? 
 I got f*cking drunk... and I shot him. 
 You what? 
 Ray had to take care of it. 
 He killed him right in front of us. 
 It really f*cked up Terry. 
 And it really f*cked up me. 
 How's Ray feel about it? 
 I don't know. 
 Why don't you f*cking ask him? 
 All right, I will. 
 Jesus, ain't that something. 
 It was really him, huh? 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe I am a bad influence. 
 It's just a lot of bad sh1t's been happening since you got here. 
 How old are you? 
 I'm 65. 
 You got any I.D. on you? 
 Like a... driver's license? 
 Social Security card? 
 Sure, I got I.D. 
 You got cash? 
 300 bucks? 
 Let's go. 
 (door creaks) 
 (chuckles) 
 You f*cking kidding me? 
 I want your wallet. 
 And I want your sneakers. 
 (grunting) 
 Woman : ...roast the perfect turkey, preheat the oven to 325... 
 Where's Eddie? 
 I need him to go to the mall and buy me new sneakers. 
 You know how hard these were to find? 
 (keys clatter) 
 (sighs) 
 My f*cking feet. 
 My arches just keep collapsing. 
 (sighs) 
 Where is he? 
 He left. 
 He take the money? 
 He only took one bag. 
 He took one bag?! 
 You fat f*ck! 
 (shouts) 
 You fat m*therf*cker! 
 (grunting) 
 What the... 
 Huh? 
 You're f*cking dead! 
 You f*cking piece of sh1t! 
 (sobbing) 
 I just slit a guy's throat, and all I got was a f*cking... 
 Ralphs card. 
 f*ck am I gonna do? 
 Well... now you're gonna have to go to the mall and get me my new sneakers. 
 All right. 
 I got to eat, Sully; I'm starving. 
 Yeah. What, you're starving? 
 Jesus f*cking... 
 Okay, it's a size 12. 
 And, here, it... 
 46 and a... half, U.K. 
 Now, we get to the Maldives... this will be like a bad dream. 
 You're still taking me? 
 Yeah, f*cking of course I'm still taking you. 
 You think I'm gonna... make friends with the freakin' Maldivians? 
 Learn a new f*cking language? 
 Forget it. 
 I'm sorry I hit you with the shoe. 
 I got upset. 
 (scoffs) 
 It was a cruel thing to do. 
 Won't happen again. 
 Okay, Sully. 
 Okay. 
 (exhales) 
 (phone beeping) 
 (ringtone playing) 
 Hi, Grandpa. 
 Conor, where's your dad? 
 Uh, where he always is. 
 I don't know. 
 How about your mom? 
 Uh, we're at this big hotel. 
 She's still in bed. 
 Something's wrong with her. 
 What's the name of it? 
 You all right? 
 I lied to Frances. 
 It's gonna tear us apart. 
 Maybe not. 
 No. 
 It will. 
 We did what had to be done. 
 Murder, Ray? 
 I can't condone it. 
 You should've told me what happened to you. 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah? 
 You should've told somebody when it happened to you. 
 Might have stopped him, Ter. 
 I didn't know what to make of it. 
 I broke his fingers and that was that. 
 I didn't have words for it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What do you want to do? 
 About what? 
 (sighs) 
 The nurse. 
 I think you got to let her go, Ter. 
 That's easy for you to say. 
 You got a family. 
 (door opens) 
 (phone vibrating) 
 Yeah. 
 We found it. 
 He comes every day as soon as the buffet opens, and he's always the first in line. 
 Tell Avi to meet me there. 
 Want you to go to that hotel and check on my family. 
 Right. The, uh... place at the beach? 
 Yeah. I'll call you later. 
 All right, boss. 
 (gasps) 
 What the f*ck, Mick?! 
 Oh, I'm... Abby. 
 Me darlin'. I was... 
 I was waiting for you. 
 (sighs) 
 And I fell asleep. 
 (sniffs) 
 The bed was so soft. 
 Do you know how f*cking inappropriate this is? 
 I didn't want to wake you. 
 I didn't mean any harm. 
 I was talking to Conor. 
 I, uh... I was worried about you, so I came. 
 Tired, I guess. 
 It's been a rough few days. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Me, too. 
 You want to talk about it, I'm here for you. 
 Does that pull out? 
 You're not staying here, Mick. 
 Well, whatever's going on, right now you got to get up. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 No, I'm not. 
 You got to be a mother to your children. 
 (chuckles) 
 That's ironic coming from you. 
 The past is the past. 
 Right now... you're getting up. 
 You lay your f*cking hands on me, and I'll scream. 
 You need to get up. 
 Conor's upset. 
 So is Bridget. 
 How do you know? 
 I talked to 'em. 
 You got some f*cking nerve, you know that? 
 I do. Go take a shower. 
 You get up, I go. 
 Go on.

 Relax, Tiny. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 You got a lot of problems, Tiny. 
 Why don't you let me help you? 
 Go f*ck yourself, Ray. 
 Sully's gonna kill you. 
 You know that, right? 
 He's out of f*cking control. 
 So let me help you. 
 We got Eddie, Tiny. 
 You're just saying that to scare me. 
 Nah, he got hit by a car. 
 We got the money back. 
 But you got another million belongs to me. 
 I didn't come to L.A. to kill a f*cking movie star.

 Here's the deal. 
 I'll let you keep half the money, throw in a boat trip to Rosarito, plus the passports. 
 When you get to Mexico, Sully can go anyplace he wants. 
 I got contacts down there that can get him to the Maldives. 
 I don't trust him no more. 
 Can I come work for you? 
 (writing) 
 Take Sully my offer. 
 Call me when it's done. 
 I got no family, Ray. 
 And-and I don't blend in. 
 Sully ain't gonna take me with him. 
 
 
 
 Hi, sweet pea. 
 Hi, Grandpa. 
 Hi, honey.

 What's wrong with him? 
 He ate too much. 
 Now he doesn't feel well. 
 Oh. My sweet boy. 
 How you doing? 
 Conor : Not so good. 
 Bridget : Hi, Mama. 
 You feel better? 
 I do, sweetheart. 
 Sorry I was short before. 
 It's okay. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Will you order me a ginger ale? 
 I want to talk to Mick. 
 Sure. 
 Better order two; your son's got a stomachache. 
 What's wrong, Con? 
 I'm fine. 
 Maybe you need to fart. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 We go talk, Mick? 
 Ain't this something? 
 Finally have our day at the beach? Huh? 
 What are you doing here, Mick? 
 Wanted to make sure you... you were all okay, that's all. 
 You know Ray was abused? 
 That same priest that abused Bunchy? 
 Yeah. 
 (scoffs) That's all you got to say about it? 
 (sighs) 
 Kids say the craziest things. 
 You calling my husband a liar, Mick? 
 No, you... 
 It's just, you know... 
 It was different then. 
 Different how? 
 Everybody got molested. 
 Half the kids in my neighborhood got molested. 
 Everybody knew about it. 
 (chuckles) 
 This-this one lady used to show me her tits every f*cking Sunday. 
 Run her hands through my hair every time she saw me. 
 Pat my ass. 
 (chuckles) 
 You're the wolf. 
 What? 
 Ray was right. 
 You're the f*cking wolf, Mickey. 
 I'm a wolf? 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 A wolf. 
 A howling wolf? 
 (howls) 
 Look. 
 Maybe I looked the other way too much. Maybe I did. 
 I'm just saying, I had my hands full. 
 You know how hard it was to make a living? 
 Selling coke? 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah, that must've been real hard. 
 Geez, I can't tell you nothing, can I? 
 What the f*ck is going on today? 
 I want you to leave, Mickey. 
 Stay away from my family. 
 Abby, come on. 
 I thought we were friends. 
 You wrote to me; all those letters helped me so much. 
 You know how much it meant to me keeping up with those kids? 
 I love those kids. 
 I really do. 
 Why don't you love your own kids, Mick? 
 I don't get this, Abby. 
 What did I do? 
 You need to put on sunblock, Conor. 
 Leave me alone. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah, we're fine. 
 You need to leave.

 I'll get plastic surgery. 
 (lips smacking) 
 I can look like a completely different person for 30 thou. 
 I passed a million places in the last few days. 
 I'll walk right in, hand 'em cash.

 Leave me the f*ck alone. 
 Call Ray, and tell him I said... no deal. 
 (dialing)

 Mickey : It's your father. 
 Don't hang up. 
 What do you want? 
 I'm beginning to see I caused a lot of trouble since I got here. 
 The scales are falling from my eyes. 
 The boys told me what happened, Ray. 
 I want to see you. 
 Give me ten minutes. 
 Then I'll leave town, be out of your life forever. 
 You're lying. 
 Ask Bunch. I moved out. 
 The Fite Club. One hour. 
 Ezra : Raymond. 
 Can I talk to you for a minute? 
 In private? 
 Whatever you have to say, Raymond, you can say it. 
 I've asked Deb to marry me, and she's accepted. 
 Congratulations, Deb. 
 A wife can't testify against her husband. 
 I, um... I think I'll-I'll change the baby. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Ooh, let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 I think Ruth would want me to be happy. 
 You know, they met once. 
 Ruth didn't know that she was my mistress. 
 I felt terrible. 
 Ruth liked her. 
 Sully didn't take the bait. 
 I'm gonna use our sources, put out a bulletin. 
 Say he was sighted in Santa Monica. 
 No, Raymond. 
 Then anyone could turn him in. 
 We can't risk it. 
 Sully knows everything. 
 What's your plan, Ezra? 
 I hire you to come up with the plan. 
 Then let me do my f*cking job. 
 (door slams) 
 Hey, man. 
 Did my dad send you? 
 Yep. 
 Where's Abby? 
 Yeah, she had to take Conor upstairs. 
 How come?

 Threw up in the hot tub. 
 Oh, Jesus.

 Hey, come on.

 Want to go for a walk? 
 Yeah. 
 Bridget :  I had this boyfriend, 
 Marvin. 
 He did one thing, and my father almost killed him. 
 What'd he do? 
 He got a little rough with me. 
 He's from a different culture, you know? 
 He's more mature. 
 He apologized. 
 I believe you. 
 My dad's a f*cking racist. 
 No, he's a good guy; you just have to give him a chance. 
 He disappears all the time; it's a joke. 
 Now everybody's all f*cked up, and it's his fault. 
 Well... when I first met him, he really helped me out. 
 How? 
 I beat someone up. 
 Got in a lot of trouble for it. 
 I have anger issues. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 But your dad was really good to me. 
 He could see past that. 
 He bailed me out and gave me a job. 
 Hey, listen... 
 I know what a bad father is. 
 And you don't have one. 
 So... stay open. 
 And I think you'll realize he's okay.
