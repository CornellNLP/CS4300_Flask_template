 Previously on  Ray Donovan: 
 Now, get off the f*cking... 
 (grunts, groans) 
 You were just in a shoot-out with Sully Sullivan. 
 How the f*ck do I explain what he's doing here? 
 You hired us to help you find Sully. 
 You were never here. 
 You understand? 
 Get the f*ck out. 
 Mickey :  Hey, boys. 
 I'm back. 
 Come on, let it go. 
 You got hit. It happens. 
 Keith :  Mickey Donovan? 
 I'm Ronald Keith. 
 I'm your new parole officer. 
 The Ruth Goldman Cancer Center is the most important thing in my life. 
 June Wilson pledged $5 million, and now I can't get her on the phone. 
 I'm going to have to sell my art collection. 
 Ezra :  What the f*ck did you do, Raymond? 
 She can't afford it. 
 Not acceptable, Raymond. 
 Abby :  He's buying me the house  of my dreams. 
 What did you just write? 
 You're really not gonna let me interview the agent that shot Sully Sullivan? 
 He's on another case, Ms. McPherson. 
 Anything else I can help you with? 
 Mickey Donovan. 
 There's a reporter from Boston here... 
 Kate McPherson. 
 Keep her away from Mick. 
 My father's not coming home tonight. 
 What the f*ck are you so afraid of? 
 You want to go get a drink? 
 What do you know? 
 The FBI said Sully was here for six months. 
 It's not true. 
 I got proof. 
 You know what Sully would've said about you? 
 "Kate McPherson... you're a real pisser, you know that?" 
 (music playing quietly over speakers) 
 (sighs) 
 What else you got in there? 
 Nothing. I... 
 Ah, f*ck. 
 (panting, wheezing) 
 I can't f*cking run. 
 (heavy breathing, moaning) 
 You want to be on top. 
 That's what you want. 
 (both grunting) 
 That's what I want. 
 Cochran : ♪ You can't see the mornin' ♪ 
♪ But I can see the light ♪ 
♪ Try, try, try to let it ride ♪ 
♪ While you've been out runnin' ♪ 
♪ I've been waiting half the night ♪ 
♪ Try, try, try... 
 Try, try, try, to let it ride ♪ 
 (chuckling): Hey. 
 It's Scrabble night. 
 Yeah. I'll be home early. 
 Oh, hey, should I make the artichoke dip or the cheese dip? 
 Uh, the casserole. (cell phone ringing) 
 Megan loves your casserole. 
 Cochran here. 
 Yeah. 
 Wh-Wh-Wh... 
 What? 
 Jesus F. Christ. 
 Oh, f*ck, f*ck! 
 f*ck! f*ck! 
 f*ck! God. f*ck! 
 Edward! 
 That is enough. 
 (sighs) 
 You're right. 
 Sorry. 
 Where's Ray Donovan? 
 Ask you something? 
 Sure. 
 You do this a lot? 
 No. 
 You? 
 No. 
 Hey. 
 Just because we f*cked doesn't mean I won't do my job. 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Can I see you again? 
 I don't think that's such a good idea. 
 That's too bad. 
 (door closes) 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 (sighing) 
 Hello? 
 Hey, Deb... 
 I want to put in an offer on that house. 
 Uh... okay. 
 Um... they're asking $4.6 million. 
 What do you want to offer? 
 Four-point-six. 
 You don't have to offer the full asking price. 
 Just get the house, Deb. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Ray. 
 Morning, Ray. 
 Rushing home to see the wife and kids? 
 What do you want? 
 Tell me something... how long has this piece of sh1t been on your payroll? 
 What do you need, Cochran? 
 3:00 a.m., this asshole was arrested for stealing a chicken. 
 He's harmless. 
 "Harmless." Okay. 
 'Cause he was f*cking mouthing off to a detective, said he was on the docks the night that Sully got shot. 
 Is that true? 
 Christ, is there anyone who wasn't there? 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Yeah, how you gonna do that? 
 You gonna take him upstairs and f*ck him like that reporter? 
 He's not a problem. 
 Not after you make him disappear, he's not. 
 That's not what I do, Cochran. 
 Oh, don't fool yourself, Ray. 
 You don't have morals. 
 I told you I'd take care of it. 
 (grunts, mutters) 
 (cell phone rings) 
 (sighs) 
 sh1t. 
 (sighs heavily) 
 Ronald Keith. 
 I need you to do something for me. 
 No, sorry. 
 Not on the clock today. 
 I'm in the office tomorrow. 
 You sure about that, Ron? 
 Give me a break, man. 
 This is my only day off. 
 What do you want? 
 Woman (over computer) : The handsome man can't dance with the band. 
 The handsome man can't dance with the band. 
 In his mansion even though he has a tan. 
 In his mansion even though he has a tan. 
 What's that? 
 (flat American accent): And where were you last night? 
 Why are you talking like that? 
 Like what? 
 Uh, I-I was with Marvin. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Can't stop you. 
 What are we eating? 
 Don't ask me. 
 You guys seem to come and go whenever you want. 
 Bridget : Just have some cereal or something. 
 f*ck that sh1t. 
 I want an egg; I didn't do anything bad. 
 (door opens, closes) Mom’s on strike or something. 
 Nice of you stop by, Ray. 
 I put in a bid on that house. 
 (shower running) 
 You think we'll get it? 
 Yeah. 
 How much? 
 4.6 
 Jesus, Ray, can we afford it? 
 Of course we can. 
 Thank you, sweetheart. 
 Thank you. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Hey, hey, Abs, come on. 
 Hey, I don't have time. 
 You had time twice a day for the last two weeks. 
 Now you can't f*ck me? 
 Abs, I'm sorry, I got to go. 
 I'm already late. 
 I'll call you later. 
 (sighs) 
 (muttering) sh1t, I don't need Medicare. 
 This ain't f*cking right. 
 This ain't right. 
 It's right, amigo. 
 Look, federal, state, local, locker and uniform. 
 You guys are better crooks than I ever f*cking was. 
 Mr. Donovan? 
 Who's asking? 
 Kate McPherson. 
 Boston Globe. 
 (clears throat)  Boston Globe? 
 Huh, ain't that something? 
 What are you doing way out here in Los Angeles? 
 Looking for you. 
 Oh, yeah? What for? 
 (bell dinging) Donovan. 
 Time for a piss test. 
 I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 About what? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm his parole officer. 
 Let's go, Donovan. 
 I'd like to ask you about Sully Sullivan. 
 I don't know who you're talking about. 
 Come on, Mick, you're wasting my time. 
 It was nice to meet you, Mr. Donovan. 
 Your son, Ray, says I can't talk to you. 
 But I think you should make up your own mind. 
 I always do, sweetheart. 
 What the f*ck are you still doing here, Tiny? 
 Don't you think I want to go back to Boston? 
 I still go family there. 
 What's stopping you? 
 Sully's mom is a m*therf*cker. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 She has 15 people who will kill me; I'm not going back there while that C-U-N-T is still alive. 
 She's a hundred years old; what are you so scared of? 
 Are you mad at me? 
 Get in the f*cking car. 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah? 
 Keith : I got him. 
 Put him on. 
 It's Ray. 
 Ray? 
 Mick, that woman you met this morning, don't f*cking talk to her. 
 What's in it for me if I don't? 
 I'm keeping you out of prison. 
 I want to go to the Fite Club. 
 I want to see my boys. 
 You do that for me, and I'll let it lie. 
 Ma'am, $275 is the-the lowest I can go. 
 I-I mean, the prices are on the handlebars. 
 There are cheaper bikes on Craigslist. 
 Hey. 
 If you could have any bike, what kind would you want? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, tell me about your lifestyle. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 Well, where you gonna be riding it, Hmm? Dirt, gravel? 
 I want to ride on the sidewalk. 
 You want to pop wheelies? 
 Boy : Nothing crazy. 
 Okay. I hear you. 
 I hear you. 
 (short laugh) Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Listen, I overheard, uh, I think I can put something together for you. 
 Oh... 
 Thanks, but we... we don't have a lot of money. 
 We shouldn't have even come in. 
 Come back later this afternoon. 
 I think I can find something that works for the both of you. 
 Oh! Oh! 
 What the f*ck? 
 (panicked breathing) 
 You told the cops you saw the shooting? 
 (stammers) I panicked, Ray. 
 I d... I-I can't go to prison. 
 Everybody thinks I set Sully up. 
 I go to prison, Sully's guys'll kill me. 
 What's the first f*cking thing you learn when you're five years old on Dorchester Street? 
 (whimpers) Huh? 
 You don't f*cking talk to the cops! 
 (sobs) 
 Jesus f*cking Christ, Tiny. 
 You didn't see the press conference? 
 You know how we're playing this? 
 Are you out of your f*cking mind? 
 I'm sorry, Ray. 
 Stand him up. 
 No. 
 No, no, no. 
 Over there. 
 Don't, no, no. 
 Come on. 
 No, Ray, no. No, no. 
 Don't... No... (crying) 
 Don't shoot me, Ray. 
 Don't shoot me. 
 Look at me, Tiny. 
 Look at me. 
 (shutter clicks) 
 What're you gonna do, Ray? 
 Make sure he doesn't take one f*cking step out of this room. 
 You understand me, Av? 
 Okay. 
 Cochran doesn't trust you. 
 He'll be out of the country by tonight. 
 So what, Ray? 
 You just a f*cking travel agent now? 
 Look at Frank Barnes with his brand-new balls. 
 Let me ask you something, Frank. 
 You think Cochran's gonna look after you when this is all over? 
 (low, indistinct chatter) 
 I'm back. 
 Where the f*ck is everybody? 
 Narrator (on TV) : On the northwest coast of Ireland. 
 These mountains by the sea were the final strongholds of the earls of Tír Chonaill and Tyrone. 
 Remote. Beautiful. 
 What are you, depressed? 
 What are you watching this sh1t for? 
 I'm moving there. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 I'd go, too, if I could. 
 You know what your brother's doing to me? 
 Starving me to death. 
 There, there, look. 
 I'm not supposed to live like this. 
 This is America. 
 You know what we got to do? 
 Another Fite Nite, Terr. 
 What do you say? 
 Daryll : Hey, Terry, guess what... 
 I'm up to five... miles. 
 What the f*ck? You're driving again? 
 Yeah, I am. 
 Terry and me... just talking about you getting back in the ring. 
 Don't put words in my mouth. 
 Daryll : Are you serious? 
 I'm not getting back in the ring for you, Mick. You sold me out. 
 f*ck that. 
 What's with him, huh? 
 What'd you go back to being a chauffeur for? 
 That's demeaning. 
 I am making a living, Pop. 
 I made you a living. 
 I still can. 
 (laughs) 
 Wow. 
 You know... 
 You know, Mom used to tell me these stories about the great Mickey Donovan. 
 How people looked at you with respect. 
 What a f*cking joke. 
 Like, why do you got to be so f*cked up, Mick? 
 Why do you got to be such an asshole? 
 All right. Don't get all emotional. 
 Anything on this guy? 
 No, he's a f*cking Boy Scout, Ray. 
 He loves his wife, he plays classic rock on the weekends and he only hangs out with other guys in law enforcement. 
 Here. 
 Is that Tiny? 
 Yeah. How quick can you get me a passport, ticket to the Maldives and 15 grand in cash? 
 Oh, you... got to give me at least a day. 
 Got two hours. 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah? 
 Deb : Congratulations. 
 They accepted the offer on the Trousdale house. 
 Okay. 
 I need a check for a million in 24 hours. 
 Is that a problem? 
 No. Not a problem, Deb. 
 (sighs) 
 Put Ezra on the phone. 
 It's Ray Donovan. 
 Sorry, Ray. Ezra's in a meeting. 
 He's been in a meeting for two days. 
 That's right. 
 (rope skipping, gloves hitting heavy bags) 
 (panting and groaning) 
 You look tough. (laughs) 
 I've been managing fighters down in Mexico. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm back in the States looking for new blood. 
 What's your fighting weight? 
 165. 
 165. Here. Dig, dig, dig. 
 Boom, boom! You've got some power. 
 See, I found a way for my fighters to make real money down there. 
 How's that? 
 Well, a guy like you, with the right management, pick up some serious dough, but you got to learn to take a fall. 
 Terry : That's enough, Mick. 
 What did I do? 
 Get the f*ck out of here. 
 I run a clean establishment. 
 Terry... 
 Get out. 
 You still blame me for the Parkinson's. 
 That it? 
 I told you not to go the full 12 rounds with Chuy Gomez. 
 I don't throw fights. 
 Go home, Mick. 
 See you later. 
 (enunciating): I parked the car, and I walked across the yard. 
 I parked the car, and I walked across the yard. 
 Parked the car... 
 (whispering): and I walked across... 
 (sniffing) 
 Finkel : Can you be more specific, Jackson? 
 I don't know. 
 What exactly about life makes you think it's all a-a game? 
 I don't know. 
 He's f*cking someone else, you asshole! 
 Are you happy now? 
 Abby... 
 You're the one who called it rape. 
 You put that in my head, that my own husband was raping me. 
 Abby. Abby, I have a patient! 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Ray, he doesn't want to see you. 
 You're not taking my calls? Huh? 
 Huh? 
 You disappointed me, Raymond. 
 I sent you to collect that money from June Wilson, and you didn’t do it. Don’t you know what that means ? 
 June Wilson didn’t pay, and Arthur Rosen heard, and he didn't pay, and when Arthur doesn't pay, no one pays. 
 You're right, Ezra. 
 I'm sorry. 
 June Wilson pledged you $5 million, and I'm gonna get it for you. 
 Thank you, Raymond. 
 But I'm keeping 20%. 
 That's Ruth's money. 
 20%, or you're on your own. 
 How dare you?! 
 What gives you the right to dictate terms to me? 
 Because I do your f*cking dirty work, Ezra. 
 All you think about is the RGOCC and your f*cking legacy. 
 Ruth was everything to me. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, I got a family, too. 
 Want me to shake down an old friend, I'll do it, but it's gonna cost you. 
 (click, puts gun down) 
 (sighs) 
 You didn't come here to practice. 
 Excuse me? 
 You just came to fire that gun, right? 
 Exorcize your demons. 
 That gun of yours... it's a beauty. 
 Yup. 
 It was a gift... from my husband. 
 That's a brave man, gives a gun to his wife. 
 We were younger then. 
 f*cking optimistic. 
 Well, he knows his weapons. 
 It's a good one. 
 It's just... it's not the right size for your hand. 
 Oh, it's fine. 
 Here, try this one. 
 Go ahead. 
 How's that feel? 
 Okay. 
 Feels okay. 
 Just okay? 
 Feels good. 
 Let her rip. 
 (click) 
 
 
 
 Hey, Mickey. 
 (laughs) 
 Why the long face? 
 You believe this sh1t? 
 I got a sh1t job in a Mexican restaurant. 
 Now my sons all turn their backs on me. 
 Man, this is almost a hundred bucks. 
 (laughs) 
 Right? 
 Look at you. 
 You got f*cking cancer, they throw you out of the can, put you in this f*cking sh1t hole. 
 You always got a smile on your face. 
 Here, give me a hit. 
 I thought you were being tested. 
 I already pissed this morning. 
 Not gonna test me twice in one day. 
 (laughs) 
 June isn't home. 
 It's all right. 
 I can wait. 
 Ray. 
 Don't put your hands on me, Carlo. 
 Like I said, she is not home, so you need to go... 
 (groaning) 
 (groaning continues) 
 (sighs, gasps) 
 So, may I fix you a drink? 
 No. 
 All business. 
 I told you Ezra won't take no for an answer. 
 (sighs) 
 Did you look inside that envelope? 
 No. 
 Mm. Open it. 
 Go ahead, open it. 
 That's my daughter Alison. 
 I've kept her hidden her entire life. 
 You must think that's a horrible thing to do, right? Hmm? 
 I'm not judging you, June. 
 No, you're just extorting me. 
 (laughs) 
 Ezra wants that money. 
 I'm sure he does. 
 Ezra helped me hide her, and he said, "Nobody will ever know." 
 The problem is, Ezra knew. 
 I worked with Mr. Lean, Mr. Hitchcock, Billy Wilder. 
 I've been nominated for an Oscar four times. 
 I will not let this be what I'm remembered for. 
 I'm sorry, June. 
 Oh, don't act so sad. 
 Ezra pays you very, very well to do the things you do. 
 If there's ever anything you need. 
 Thanks. 
 But I won't be seeing you again. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Do you like it? 
 Cool. 
 Why don't you go take it for a spin? 
 Come on now. 
 It's awesome. 
 Thank you. 
 Whoo. 
 Thank you. 
 He loves it. 
 (laughs) 
 Uh, my name is Patty. 
 Uh, that's Clifford. 
 Brendan. 
 Uh, but everyone calls me Bunchy. 
 Bunchy. (laughs) 
 That's a... that's a funny name. 
 Hey, there's a... this little Mexican joint around the corner that we're going to later. 
 Do you... do you want to join us? 
 Uh, okay. 
 Great. 
 Great. 
 Abby. 
 Here. 
 You're a cop? 
 I'm a detective with the LAPD. 
 Don't hold it against me. 
 Why are you giving me this? 
 Well, you never know when you're gonna get in trouble. 
 If you do, you give me a call. 
 So I should only call you if I get in trouble? 
 (truck door closes) 
 (engine starts) 
 (phone rings) 
 Your father's in pretty damn good shape. 
 Yeah, I heard you paid him a visit. 
 Well, his parole officer just happened to stop by, so we didn't get a chance to talk. 
 Know something about that, Ray? 
 Well, just because we f*cked doesn't mean I'm not gonna do my job. 
 (crowd cheering on TV) 
 Get up. We're going. 
 Where? 
 The Maldives. 
 The Maldives? 
 I-I don't even know where that is. 
 Indian Ocean. It's beautiful. 
 You been there? 
 No. 
 But you seen pictures? 
 I seen pictures of a piece of paper that says they don't extradite, all right? 
 The natives there, are they friendly? 
 You don't need to worry about the natives, Tiny. 
 The natives need to worry about you. 
 Come on. We got a plane to catch. 
 Okay... 
 I just got to piss first. 
 (door opens) 
 (sighs) 
 (door closes) 
 How's your mother? 
 Mm-mm. Don't ask. 
 She had a fight with her bridge partner, and now she calls me five times a... 
 (loud crash) (Tony gasps, groans) 
 (Tiny sobbing) 
 (grunts) Oh, I-I think I pulled my hamstring. 
 (Tiny grunts, groans) 
 We're gonna have to stitch him up. 
 I ain't going there, Ray! 
 Let me just go back to Boston. 
 I swear, you'll never hear from me again. 
 Just let me go back to Boston. 
 Shut up. 
 You're getting on that f*ckin' plane, Tiny. 
 Mickey : When I was in Walpole... 
 I read this book about why people hate. 
 (chuckling): The oxygen makes it even better. 
 Complicated book. 
 Boiled down... that all hate comes from the inside out. 
 Do you believe that kind of sh1t? 
 (chuckles) I don't f*ckin' know. 
 I like everybody. 
 Makes life easier. 
 (sniffing) 
 Oh. (laughs) 
 (continues laughing) 
 Oh... I see what you mean. 
 (exhales) 
 Dolphin :  Mickey. 
 Mickey. (exhales) I was wrong about you, Mickey. What? You are not a captain, Mickey. You are a sailor. You are only a sailor. I'm not a f*ckin' sailor! Never said you f*ckin' were. Did I? Sorry, Mick. (door slams) (chuckles) (panting) (taking deep breaths) (phone rings) Hello? I got a story for you. But it's gonna cost. I don't buy stories. All right, f*ck it, then. You don't want to hear how I was on the dock when Sully got shot? Hold on. Maybe we can work something out. Keep talking. I'll need to speak with you in person. Can you meet me? I got a little problem with that, sweetheart. I can't leave where I'm at. Well, I know where you are; I'll come to you. (quietly): Okay. Donna (over phone) :  So, the head  of the judiciary committee is having dinner with us tomorrow night. Yeah. (laughs) Next stop Washington, baby. (chuckles) Isn't that great? Yeah. That's, uh, that's great news. What's wrong, sweetie? I'm just, uh... I'm trusting that somebody's doing something for me, but, uh, I'm not sure it's gonna get done. Mm. Well, as my mother always told me, if you want something done, you do it yourself. (laughs) Oh, that's why I love you, Donna. (chuckles) (groans) (phone ringing) Yeah? I need to see you, right now. It's time. Keep walking. I don't want to go away all by myself there. Get in the f*cking car, Tiny. I don't want to go. I'll work for you. I... I can do what Avi does... I can help you. You're not gonna work for me, Tiny. Ray... don't make me. You don't got a choice. You understand me? Cash in there to get you started, and a passport. "Bert Handey"? That's you. But I ain't Bert Handey. Aw, come on. I'm Kenneth Benson. I'm Tiny! I belong in Southie. I just f*ckin' came out here with Sully to do a job for you. You're gonna get... I ain't going! And you can't turn me into Bert f*ckin' Handey. You don't get it, do you? You don't got a f*ckin' choice. I do. I do, and I ain't goin'! Put him back inside. Come on. Remember when SpongeBob got that jellyfish as a pet, and he put it on a leash? Yeah. Squidward hated that jellyfish. (imitates Squidward): I wouldn't let that thing in my house even if it was potty trained. (laughter) Uh, I'm gonna get a beer. You want a beer? It's on me. I don't drink no more. Got it. I'll have a Coke. I want a Coke, too. Oh, just... one, please. Thanks. So, uh, how did you... how'd you learn how to build a bike? (exhales): Um... I got a... hand-me-down bike from my brother, uh, but it got stolen. My parents couldn't afford a new one, so... I had to build my own. No one's gonna steal your bike, all right? I promise. And if they do, they're gonna have to answer to me. (giggles) (vehicle approaching) Our friend in the motel room. I'm taking care of it. Everything you tell me is a lie, Ray. Everything. Mickey (recorded) : I got a story for you. But it's gonna cost. Kate : I don't buy stories. Mickey : All right, f*ck it, then. You don't want to hear how I was on the dock when Sully got shot? You don't have anything under control, do you? Not your father, not that reporter, not the fat f*ck in the motel room. You won't hear from him again. It's too late for your plan, Ray. Don't... don't do it. Do what? Don't kill him. Who said anything about killing anybody? Wha... (scoffs) I got a man on him. He's not gonna let anything happen. You have an ex-Mossad agent who spends his nights watching television with his mother. I have every man in the entire Los Angeles Federal law enforcement system. (chuckles): f*ck. What's the matter with you? (doorbell chimes) Congratulations... you're moving to Trousdale! (both laughing) Come in. Whoo. Abby (over phone) : We got the house. That's right. When were you gonna tell me? I wanted to tell you in person. Well, I know now, 'cause Deb's here. She brought champagne. She thought you'd be here, too. I'm glad you're happy. When are you coming home? Soon as I can. Okay then, Ray. Go home. I'm taking over. What do you mean, you're taking over? I mean I'm taking over. Go home, Av. Just... be careful, boss. Yeah. (door closes) Mmm. Mm. (grunts) Ah. Oh, I don't want to get sick, Ray. Go ahead, you'll be fine. So do I get to work with you, Ray? Sure. I just couldn't go to that place, Ray. I get it. I wouldn't want to leave home, either. Mm. I'm just a simple person. I like what I like. I know you are, Tiny. Mmm. I'd like some ice cream. I'll go get you some. Yeah? Thanks, Ray.
