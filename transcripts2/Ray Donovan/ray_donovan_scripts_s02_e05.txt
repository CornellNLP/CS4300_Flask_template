 Previously on Ray Donovan... 
 Try this one. 
 Abby : You're a cop. Well, you never know when you're gonna get in trouble. If you do, give me a call. We met today at the gun range. I'm going back there tomorrow. Mickey : What'd your father say about what happened? He was supposed to take me to the kid's house to apologize. Donovans don't apologize. Re-Kon : It's your new birthday, son. You got a whole new life ahead of you. Thanks, Re-Kon. Bridget : Jesus, Marvin, what are you doing here? My dad will kill you. I miss you, Bridg. I've gone to some very bad places in my life trying to be brave. So have I. Linda : So we have that in common. Mickey : It's not the way things are done, Sully. You kill a woman for passion. This is business. (gunshot) Deb : This is Abby Donovan. Maybe your new neighbor. Oh, you're from Boston. I find it charming. Why are you talking like that? (flat American accent): Whatever do you mean? (moaning) Kate: Just because we f*cked  doesn't mean I won't do my job. Can I see you again? Cochran : This asshole was f*cking mouthing off to a detective. Said he was on the docks the night that Sully got shot. Don't kill him. Cochran : Who said anything about killing anybody? (gunshot) (groans) Kate McPherson, Boston Globe. I got a story for you. I'll need to speak with you in person. Can you meet me? Ray : You talk to my father, your life is in danger. I'm texting you an address. Will you be there? Man : Mickey Donovan! (grunting) (dogs snarling) (barks) (sighs) Go ahead, Con. (sighs) Okay. I shouldn't have pushed you down the stairs. But you did break my phone. (scoffs) Is that it? Go on. Go on, what? I said I shouldn't have done it. I didn't hear the words, "I'm sorry." Tell him you're sorry. Dad, it's okay. We're friends. Hey. Is he gonna apologize or not? Conor. What? Say you're sorry. He shouldn't make me a bitch. Hey. A bitch? Is this what you teach him? You don't talk to us like that. Relax. Look at me when I'm talking, you little dick. This is over. Over? Come on, Con, let's go. He broke my kid's collarbone, for Christ's sake. He's a menace! You're gonna hear from my lawyer! (sighs) (exhales) You blocked me in at the boxing gym. Ray sent me to watch you. I'm staying with you all day. Have a bagel. I have things to do. Ray told me to show you this. You know who that is, right? Kenneth Benson. Tiny. He was part of Sully's gang. Ray was not kidding. Things are dangerous now. I can take care of myself. (sighs) (phone rings) (chirps) Yeah? Couple of guys took your father last night. What do you mean, "took him"? Took him. They kidnapped him! They broke the f*cking door down! Those guys were pros! Hey, shut up. Big time! Sit the f*ck down. Someone took Grandpa? Find him. Do your job. (sighs) What the f*ck do you think I'm doing? (softly): Piece of sh... (sighs) Don't worry, Conor. That was his parole officer. He'll find him. Dad? Did he really kill somebody? I don't want to talk about it, Con. It was a long time ago. Oh, I heard from Senator Feinstein's office. We are set for the fund-raiser tonight. Head table. Good. Oh, sweetie, look at those scratches. Let me get you some Neosporin. You were a real tiger last night. Never seen you like that before. Ed, what's wrong? Loose ends. I just... I'm cleaning them up today, though. That is right, babe. You don't let anything distract you. You have to be on point tonight with Senator Feinstein. She's a gun-hating liberal. She is the senior member of the judiciary committee, and we are going to need her support for your confirmation. Yeah. Eddie, keep your eyes on the prize. You're right. You're right, as usual. (laughing): Hey, hey. Hey, Frank. Oh, f*ck! Where's my father? I don't know! (grunts) Your guys took him. Where'd you put him? I don't know and I don't give a sh1t. Yeah? (groaning) Oh! f*ck! (groans) Where is he, Frank? You think Cochran tells me anything? He doesn't tell me sh1t. He tells you to kill people. He made me kill that poor fat fucker. It was like killing a f*cking dog. Oh, f*ck! Where's my father, Frank? I don't know! Cochran's cut me out! Then give me something I can use against him. I think he's clean. All right, all right! f*ck! There's a rumor that he's f*cking someone's wife. Who? (panting) His ASAC, Volcheck. f*ck. (grunting) f*ck! That was for Tiny. (beeping) Bridget : Mama, I'm getting sick. I think I should stay home from school. Okay. Okay? What's that? It's a gun. Your father gave it to me. What's it for? I shoot it at a range. It's a sport. I really think I'm sick. Feel my head. Oh, it feels fine. You barely touched it. Do you want to see a doctor? No, but... So stay home. You're making straight A's. Don't you want to check my temperature? There's a thermometer in the bathroom. (chuckles) Mickey disappeared last night. Call Steve Davis. See if he knows anything. Okay, boss. You want me to check the morgue, too? No, not yet. Yeah, Officer Steve Davis? Look at the time. What about it? Director of the Los Angeles FBI socializing with his ASAC until 2:00 in the morning. Cochran's supposed to be f*cking her. See if you can find any proof. Okay. Excuse me, can you tell me where Frank Barnes keeps his boat? Special Agent Barnes. I've been trying to talk to you for the past few days. I'm a reporter for The Boston Globe,  and for some reason, your boss won't let me near you. You want to tell me why? (sighs) No comment. Nobody could catch Sully, but you did. You ought to get some attention for it, not just a medal. Leave me alone. What happened to your face? I know your boss is lying. Sully didn't arrive in L.A. when he said he did. I also know that Mickey Donovan was on the docks the night Sully was killed. Maybe the FBI didn't have a plan to catch Sully. Maybe they just got lucky. Come on, Frank. What is Cochran hiding? You're gonna get yourself killed. What did you just say? Nothing. Frank! Why would someone want to kill me? Who beat you up, Frank? Ask your f*cking boyfriend. Are you talking about Ray Donovan? (panting) (engine starts) (phone ringing) Yeah? She ditched me. I lost her. Damn it, Av. What can I do? She jumped on a f*cking boat! (phone rings) Conor? Dad? Did you find Grandpa? He's gonna be fine, Con. How do you know? There's no one out there who wants to hurt him. You did! I did what? You pistol-whipped him, remember? Yeah, well, that was different. Are you really looking for him? Conor, your grandfather's gonna be fine. (grunting) You like it? You like it?! Put me in a f*cking cage! You think you can scare me?! f*ck you! f*ck you! f*ck you! (gunfire) Are those real diamonds? (laughs) Of course they real, Shawty. You know, I don't need both of these. Really? Come here. Take that one out. (quiet laugh) You wear one and I wear one. What's this for? 'Cause you're mine. I love it! Thank you. (phone chimes) Sorry. You want to go to a party? Shorty : What the f*ck are you doing? I'm looking for Mickey Donovan. What for? I'm a reporter. Oh, he was waiting for you last night! Oh, he had some important sh1t to tell you. Da Vinci Code-type sh1t. Now, I don't know where he's at. Maybe the Vatican. They're probably torturing him. He wanted to give you this. Well, I'll be on my way. You need to go back to Boston. Is this how you get rid of girls? You're causing a lot of headaches for some very dangerous people. I'm trying to protect you. When I was writing about pedophile priests, I got death threats all the time. That didn't stop me. Sully didn't die the way the FBI said he did. I can't finish my book until I know what really happened. It really bothers you, doesn't it? Not being in control? (cell phone ringing) Yeah? I know where he is. Where? It's gonna cost you. Are you f*cking kidding me? Everything I'm doing for you is illegal. I could lose my f*cking job. What do you want? I was at the track yesterday. And I'm down. Seven grand? Go to my office. The girl will give it to you. Now, where the f*ck is my father? (door closes) It's you. I want a lawyer. I know my rights. I get to make a phone call. Who'd you call, Mick? I mean, who the f*ck gives a sh1t about you? Ray? For one. Oh, yeah? Paid Sully $2 million to have you killed. Eh, it's a complicated relationship. Maybe you want to call that f*cking reporter. Oh! You're spying on me! That's against the law. That's against the law. There's no law here, Mick. There's just me. I'm the law! Me! I'm about to become the number one law enforcement officer in the United States, hell, in the f*cking free world, Mick! But you Irish Spring, you Lucky Charms-eating pieces of f*cking sh1t! You guys are gonna bring me down. Top of the morning to you. You know, Mick, I have this ambition. I don't know where it comes from. My whole life I've been on this path towards greatness. I'm disciplined, too. I don't lie. I don't cheat on my taxes. I don't text when I drive. Regular Boy Scout. Why does Ray hate you so much? I wish I could tell you. You must've done something to the guy. What did you do to him? I missed a few birthdays. Maybe. You two are the most self-destructive, crazy M*therf*ckers that I've ever met! Just us now, Mick. It's a statement. Saying that Ray told you that he killed Agent Van Miller. What, you think I'd let that go? The murder of a brother agent? (quiet laugh) You want to pin it on Ray? Sign the statement. I'll send you back to Mexico. I'm not ratting out my son! Go f*ck yourself. Okay, Mick. Enjoy the view. (door opens) Can I get some more bullets? Really getting your target practice in today. Yeah. Listen. There's a cop who shoots here sometimes, um... Uh, lots of cops shoot here. Is there a specific one that you're interested in? You know, forget the bullets. I-I got to go. Thanks. Oh. Deb : Hello? Hey, Deb. Hi, Abby. I want to see the Trousdale house. Don't tell me you're having second thoughts. No, I-I, I just want to see it. Can I get in? Cochran's holding him at the FBI building in Westwood. We need to get him out of there. We need a superior court judge. You know one? Of course. He's a dear friend. What's his name? Raymond, I can't. I need a name, Ezra. He's a religious man! We study Torah together. He won't break the law. I'll convince him. Tikkun olam. We've committed enough sins. Mickey's talking to Cochran. He could tell him everything. Sean Walker, Van Miller, Black Mass, Colleen. We could go to jail, Ezra. Irving Salzman. (door opens) I feel dirty. (hip-hop music playing) (indistinct chatter) Hey, there's Cookie. He just got home. From where? I thought he was from L.A. (laughs) No. Prison, Shawty. Come on, let's say hi. Hey, Cookie! Boy, I love the way you sing, my nigga. Hey. Thanks for these. It's three carats, baby. I want you to know I appreciate the talent. This is my girl, Bridget. Hi. How you doing, snowflake? You know what that is? Glock 45. My dad has one. (laughs) What is he a cop? Not exactly. Well, look here. You stay away from guns, all right? (laughs) Me and you, young fella? We need to talk business real soon. Any time. She's cute. I know. Yeah, I don't, uh, think I'll be late tonight, sweetheart. I have got a conference this afternoon, but I don't think that should go... Woman : Irving? Are you there? (gasps) Um... I have to call you back. What is this? God! (cell phone ringing) Ezra, listen. Something terrible's happened and... Irving, how could you?! How could I what? How could you send me this?! These are children! Do you know the danger you've put me in?! Ezra, believe me. I didn't send this to you! This is some horrible mistake! It's a virus. What... what do I do?! Calm down, calm, calm down. I know someone who can help you. I'll send him right over. You're a mensch. He's ready. Ray? He only pledged $5,000 to the RGOCC. Squeeze him for another 20. I'll see what I can do. Judy : Hi, there. I saw your car in the driveway. This is Lisa. Hi. Hi. We got off on the wrong foot the other day. Peace offering? (laughs) Sure. Why not? Let me find some glasses. It really is a beautiful house. 
 
 (door opens) This woman's body was found in the oil fields two days ago. Why don't you tell me what you know about her? I've never seen her before in my life. Really? A week before she died, you were with her at the, uh... the Four Seasons Spa. Don't ring a bell. Ballistics say the bullet that killed her is a match to Sully's gun. Pretty, huh? Dogs were chewing on her. Did you f*ck her, Mick? Yeah. But I didn't kill her. Sully did. All comes back to Sully. And who brought Sully out here? Your f*cking son. If he'd have left Sully in Boston, she'd still be alive. And Van Miller. And Catherine Shaughnessy. And God knows how many more freaking bodies are gonna pop up. f*cking Donovans, you're like a... you're like a virus. She was a nice lady. She didn't deserve to die the way she did. You don't deserve to spend the rest of your life in prison. After all, you've done your time. You bet I did. I can handle you, Mick. You're a simple man. You want to eat, drink, f*ck, enjoy your family. That's right. Maybe I don't need to put you away. But Ray's a problem. He's out of control. And I'm not gonna let him f*ck up my plans. So, which one of you goes to prison? You or Ray? You think about that, old man. I'll be back in an hour. I'm a religious man! I don't visit that kind of site! I don't know how this got onto my computer! (spooky '90s techno music plays over laptop) Unfortunately, once it's on your system, it's almost impossible to get rid of it. Oh, my God. Ezra's pretty upset you put it on his system as well. I didn't send this filth to Ezra. I... (sighs) Look... I have five grandchildren. I worship them. You understand? This is the end of me; it's the end of my career. Oh, my God, what'll my wife think? (sighs) I didn't do this. I know you didn't. It's not gonna be easy, but, uh... I can make this go away for you. You sons of bitches. What do you want? (women chuckling) Judy: I want to do it. Oh, I, I-I need to park my car. (laughing): No... ! (in Boston accent): Park my car. (imitates accent): Park my car. Yes, you're a Southie! (laughing): Yes! (gasps) Oh, my God. I drank too fast, I think I'm gonna throw up. Should we help you out to your... (in Boston accent): car... ? (women laughing hysterically) Shut up! (gasps) What? I'm sorry. (sighs) I don't feel good. I think this is a mistake; I-I don't even like this house anymore. Where do you shop? Where's the market? Where's the post office? Darling, it's Trousdale. I'm sure it's a lot more convenient than Calabasas. But... it's not for everyone. What does that mean? We know all about your husband. I mean, we know what he does. When you're ready to ditch him, Blanche Blaylock is a personal friend of mine. She'll get you a good deal. I'm not leaving my f*cking husband. Maybe that's what you people do; where I come from, we stick it out. Ray's a good provider... he's a loving father. Oh, honey, let's face it... (laughing): he's basically a street thug. (women screaming) (shouting): Who the f*ck do you think you are?! You let go of me! Call the police! Call the police. I'll call my f*cking husband and he'll kill you. Judy : You're in f*cking trouble! You can't hurt me! (sighs) (gasps) (sighs) (panting) (phone clicking) Are you ready? Yeah, in a minute. Help me out here, I can't... I can't reach. Come on. Last thing I need are for these things to get infected. (sniffs) I usually... Get the bottom part, huh? (sighs) (grunts) Yeah, that's it. Just get a... a little, uh, a little higher. I'm getting tired of this. Really? So what? Come on. Let's go nail this leprechaun-loving asshole. FBI Agent : This is an FBI operation. Detective : We're stepping in. FBI Agent : Yeah, hold-hold on. Detective : No, we're taking him. What the hell is this? All right, what is LAPD doing here? FBI Agent : You can't just come in here and take a suspect. Detective : I have a warrant, asshole. Whoa, what the f*ck is going on in here? LAPD, we're taking him. No. No. No. This man is in my custody. Have you arrested him? We're holding him for questioning. Mickey Donovan, you're under arrest. I thought I already was. You have been remanded into the custody of Judge Irving Salzman. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You have the right to remain silent; Hey! Hey! Anything you say can and will be used against you... Back the f*ck off! Judge Salzman's declared him a material witness for one of his cases. I don't give a sh1t. I'm the f*cking FBI! The judge's order trumps your authority. Let's go. You, you got to be kidding me. And if you try to stop us, you'll be obstructing justice. Well, I'll f*cking have your badge, pal. You'll be working security at f*cking Home Depot! You got me wrong, pal. I'd never give up my son. Go f*ck yourself. (phone chiming) (sighs) Donovan. (scoffs) You m*therf*cker. You m*therf*cker! Sorry to spoil your party, but I need to see my father. I don't know how you did this,  but I promise you I'm gonna nail you for it. No, you're not; you're gonna thank me. (hip-hop music playing) (indistinct conversations) So, uh, how long have you known Cookie? Mm, couple weeks. Since he got out. Why do you think he gave you these earrings? They must've been really expensive. Shawty, when you a, when you a star, you know, people give you sh1t. Don't be all cynical, girl, it's all love. Girl (sweetly) : Hi, Marvin. (sighs) Hey, Bridg, what's wrong? Why would you want me when you can have girls like her? Who'd I give that earring to... her or you? I'm gonna show you something. (coughs, laughs) Where ya taking me, back to my shithole? No, we got to do something first. I stood by you, Ray. Didn't give you up. You know, I would never do that. Sure you would. I just got you out of there in time. Ray Ray, when are you gonna realize that I'm not the devil? All right. (sighs) I'll give you a chance to prove it. All you got to do is tell a little story. What's in it for me? (scoffs) Christ, Mick, what do you want? I don't want to peel carrots no more. It's humiliating. And I want a... uh... what do you call it? A stipend. (softly laughs, sighs) That's it? And I want to see my grandkids. (phone clinks, dings) (phone chimes) Yeah. (sighs): I need you to meet me somewhere. Why should I do anything you ask me to do? Because I'm gonna give you the end of your book. Kate? You still there? (hip-hop music playing) This is nice. Mm. Told you, didn't I? (inhales) I'm gonna go grab a soda. (chuckles) All right, all right. (giggles) I'll take a beer. Mm. (indistinct conversations) You're supposed to be home studying. Well-well, we celebrating, Cookie's back. Back from where, fool? Prison? That's where you want to be? What you need to do, is be working with that tutor I got for you. What's that sh1t in your ear? Cookie gave it to me. Well, give that sh1t back. I thought Cookie and you was tight. Yeah, well, that was a long time ago, sh1t changes. (sighs) That's Ray Donovan's daughter. Yeah. So? Have you lost your motherfucking mind? He almost killed you. And take her pasty, white ass home. You know, I don't even got to f*cking listen to you. I'm making the f*cking money now. Marvin, I'm trying to protect you, son. You need to listen to me. What's going on? Nothing. We got to go, that's all. (mouthing) This better be good. Ezra : What an honor to meet such a talented and award-winning writer. Are you Jewish? Uh, no. Too bad. The best writers usually are. Bernard Malamud, Philip Roth, Kafka. But I'm sure you're good, too. Please, uh, help yourself to coffee, seltzer, pastries... Look, can we get on with this, please? I'm going to excuse myself. Believe it or not, I have a wife and a baby at home. Not my baby, of course. (door closes) Take a seat. You were right... I've been lying to you and I've been trying to keep you from talking to my father. But not for the reasons you think. My father and I have been working with the FBI. (indistinct radio transmission) (policemen speaking indistinctly) Be safe. I appreciate it. Owe you one. Take care. (indistinct radio transmission) Hey, slugger. You all right? I should of smashed her f*cking face in. Am I under arrest? No. I talked them out of pressing charges. Thank you. Now, let's get you home. Can you just come sit beside me for a second? I don't want to go home. Can we go to a hotel and have s*x? (laughs) I'm serious. I know. Look, I really like you. But I've been in situations like this before; you're emotional. (crying) I don't want to take advantage. (whispers): Hey. (sobs) (sniffs) Will you just hold me, please?! (sniffs) (whimpers) (sniffs) (shudders) (laughing) We knew we'd never get our hands on Sully, as long as he was in Boston. We wanted him out here, where he was isolated and... easier to grab. Ray : And my father was the bait. Tell her, Dad. You ever... you ever see a... a worm on a hook? That was me. Sully was in hiding... how did you contact him? Mr. Donovan had a relationship with Sully that we felt that... I got this one. (sighs) Me and Sully were good pals, back in the day. We kept in touch... If you and Sully then why did Mrs. Sullivan call you a rat? That old broad is a racist. She hates me, because I fell in love with a black woman. You ever been in love? She's not interested in your love life, Mick. (sighs) Where was I? (deeply inhales) You let Sully know you were in L.A. (sighs): Right. Uh... I sent word back to Sully... through channels. I told him about the sunshine they got out here. About the girls with the suntans, the fake tits... Uh, how about we skip the travelogue, huh? Why are you breaking my balls?! Stick to the facts. The plan for Sully, to get him out of the country. Sure... I let it slip that I could arrange it. And sure as sh1t, Sully bit. He was a mean m*therf*cker, but not so bright. I arranged the whole thing. Cochran : Completely under the supervision of the FBI, you understand. Where did Sully think he was going? Maldives. The night it's all set, I go down to the dock and I wait. Just standing there like a rabbit in an open field. Sully shows. I lead him toward the boat... Where Special Agent Barnes was waiting, like we'd planned. Why didn't he just arrest Sully instead of shooting him? Mickey : Sully fired first. He knew it was a trap. He could smell a Fed from a mile away. Special Agent Barnes took down Sully and saved Mr. Donovan's life. If you ask me, they were a little reckless with my welfare. So you're the hero behind the hero? You have no idea. If you're all working together, why did your father offer to sell me his story? (laughs) He's an ex-con from Southie. Used to rob banks for a living. We all have our shortcomings. I'm not opposed to making a few bucks on the side if I can. I'm sorry. It was a... it was a mistake. So, I'm the only journalist who knows about this? Yeah. And I suppose you don't want me to use Mr. Donovan's name. That's right. Wait a minute. I risked my life! I don't even get credit? She uses your name, every snake in Sully's gang who's still alive's gonna come after you. We don't want that to happen, Pop, do we? Want to keep you nice and safe. Thank you, son. Means a lot to me. I think we're done here. What about Sully's girlfriend? Do you know where she is? We're not gonna allow Mr. Donovan to answer that ques... She's in witness protection. Hey. Where's Mom? Taking a shower. Did you apologize to Alex? No. His father called me a dick, and Dad made us leave. Are you high? No. You're stoned! I am not! You better get yourself straight before Dad comes home and kicks your ass. What's in your ear? It's a diamond, you asshole. Looks totally stupid. Kate (in other room) : Bob? Yeah, I got what I needed. Ray : Help yourself. Kate : I'm taking the redeye tonight. You got yourself a sweet piece. You don't know what you're talking about. Don't I? I know Cochran's gonna be a big cheese in Washington. And you and Ezra, the two of you live in luxury. And what do I got? Nothing. I want to see my grandkids, Ray. We'll see. Can't you even do me one simple act of kindness? I'm still your father. What's in me is in you. Nothing will ever change that. Come on, I'm dropping you off. (phone chimes) (whooshes) (whooshes) (sniffs) (phone chimes) (laughs softly) (camera clicks) (laughs) (whooshes) Ray : Your first book was about priests? Pedophile priests. What you write about them for? I don't know. At first, I thought I wanted to help the victims. But it turns out, I just like talking to sociopaths. They fascinate me. Did you read my book? No. Why not? Aren't you Catholic? Not anymore. Can I ask you something? Sure. Do you love your wife? Yeah. Anything else? Do you have any friends? You met Avi. He works for you. That doesn't count. I have trust issues. You think? (laughs) Me, too. I'm gonna miss you. Sportscaster (on TV) : Boys in blue are on a two-game skid heading into this evening's showdown with Arizona... I deserve better than this! What? Nothing. You really think it was the Vatican? Huh? That took you. I don't know. Do I have to keep the door open? I'd like some privacy. Just for tonight. (sighs) Okay. Did you see that? (phone buzzing) Cochran : Is she gone? Yeah. Good work today. I'm impressed. Would've handled things a little bit differently, but, uh... Like you handled Tiny? Oh, come on now, Ray. Let it go. You can't spend your life nursing grudges. (phone beeps) You look so handsome. Senator Feinstein will be eating out of your hand. (car engine starts) (tires screeching) Grandpa, okay? He's doing fine, Con.
