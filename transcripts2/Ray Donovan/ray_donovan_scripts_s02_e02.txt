 Previously on Ray Donovan... 
 Yeah? 
 We're f*cked. Director's back. Either of you two guys want to tell me who the f*ck shot Sully? My father. All right, I need your father in this office right away. You got 24 hours. So you're still having s*x two times a day? Is it possible he just likes to f*ck? Until he can face his molestation, I'm afraid your marriage is going to be in trouble. Ray : We're gonna call the kid's parents,  go over to their house, and we'll apologize. Frances : What happened to him? Terry : There's things that I can't talk about. If you can't talk about these things, then how can anything... Jesus, woman! This is who I am! We're loyal to each other! So, how big is this guy? Is he big? Mickey : He's Mexican... how big could he be? Are you kidding me, Mickey? That guy's f*cking huge! You could take this cocksucker. (Bell clangs) Yeah? Daryll : He's in Rosario. Where in Rosario? This place called Lucy's. Cochran : Hello? Ray : I got him. All right, good. ♪ (Clicking) (Sighs) (Sighs) Mickey : Lot of f*cking stars, huh? Remember that summer we rented that little place in Wellfleet? Only summer we spent together. Only summer I wasn't in the can. Saved up some real money. Your mother wanted a lobster dinner. Got 'em for her. Three pounds each. Put 'em in the bathtub... went out for something. Well, I come home... Pull back the shower curtain, they're gone. Bridget convinced you boys to throw 'em back in the ocean. (Chuckles) Jesus... I was pissed. Hundred bucks right down the drain. But you know what? Your mother made us bologna sandwiches that night. Best bologna sandwich I ever ate. It wasn't all bad, Ray. Wasn't that the summer you started f*cking Claudette? That's why you were born, Ray, to be my f*cking judge. That's always been your job. What's on your mind, boy? (Quiet chatter) Hey. You want me to get rid of him? (Sighs) No. (Sighs) Ed, look at me. This is your moment. Thanks. Volcheck : It's time. (Clears throat) (Cameras clicking) Good morning. If you were gonna kill me, you'd have put two in the back of my head by now, or had someone else do it. So what the f*ck are we doing here, Ray? The head of the FBI wants to see you. Oh, yeah? Great. They gonna give me the $2 million reward they owe me for killing Sully? They want to make sure you keep your mouth shut. FBI killed Sully. Those f*cking jerks didn't do a f*cking thing. Sully was hiding in plain sight for 20 f*cking years. (Laughs) This ain't Van Miller, Mick. You want to go back to your little hacienda, better play ball. You tell them what they want to hear, they'll turn you around and send you right back. Sounds good, but how are they gonna make sure I keep my mouth shut, Ray? You know what they got planned? (Closes zipper) I'll be all right, no matter what happens. The f*ck you waving at? A friend. I had a spiritual awakening. Banging whores and getting your kid beat up? That's some spiritual awakening, Mick. You wouldn't understand. Cochran : As you know,  under my direction, we've been tracking Patrick... "Sully" Sullivan for... many years now. It was during the course of that investigation that one of our own, Special Agent Van Miller, was tragically shot and killed by Mr. Sullivan. But Agent Miller did not die in vain. Through the heroism and the quick work of Agents Volcheck and Barnes, we were able to bring down America's most wanted. I'll take some questions now. Reporter : How long was Sully in Los Angeles? Cochran : This is an ongoing investigation, so we can't release all the details, but I can say that he was in L.A. for at least six to eight months. Bullshit. I need you to send me to L.A. they're lying about Sully. Why would the FBI lie? That's why I need to go to L.A... to find out, Bob. I'm not sending you to L.A. on a hunch. It's not the old days. I don't have the dough. Okay, here's the deal... you give me a day, I bring you something, you fly me out. (Sighs) Mickey : I like this. I'm used to ban-lon. What the f*ck is this? It's called cotton, Mick. I know where you buried the body of that priest, Ray. This goes wrong for me, you're f*cked. I'll spill. Spill all you want, Mick. Just remember, you do that, Terry, Bunch, Daryll... they all go to prison, not just me. He's waiting for you. All right. (Clears throat) I'm Mickey Donovan. Where's my f*cking reward? $2 million for shooting Sully. You think I give a sh1t about a 75-year-old gangster? You know who I care about? Mohammed, Abdul and Hakim. Fitzie, Murphy and O'Donahue? I really couldn't give a sh1t about you potato-eating, river-dancing M*therf*ckers. Oh. So... The days of you making your own decisions are over. What are you talking about? These papers... Put you on parole for the next five years. But if you don't behave,  these papers put you away for the rest of your life. You go to leavenworth as a material witness to a crime. Mickey : Oh, yeah? Which one? I don't know. Anything I f*cking want. How about, uh, the assassination of JFK? Now, get the f*ck out of my office and go report to your parole officer. Parole officer? I'm a goddamn patriot. I ratted out 20 guys for you people. You know... you know the danger I was in? I wore a wire for you. For me? I don't think so. Did you wear a wire for Van Miller? Now, which one of you M*therf*ckers killed him? He's dead? (Chuckles softly) I ain't going on parole. I know. That's fine. You're on the next flight to Guantanamo. You can be roomies with the blind sheikh. As-Salamu Alaykum, m*therf*cker. Here's how it's gonna work. You don't open your mouth about Sully. You weren't on the docks that night. And you didn't kill him. Frank did. End of story. Can I talk to you... alone? Yeah. Wait outside, huh? Yeah, you... you two work it out. Work it out. (Exhales) (Sighs) This isn't smart. You're not making the right play here. Believe me, it's a hell of a lot better for both of us if he stays in Mexico. Us? There's no "us" here, Ray. I'm sorry, are you the director of the L.A. bureau of the FBI? Look, Cochran, I don't want to tell you your job, but my father... (Sighs) You don't want him around. You put him on parole, you won't be able to control him. Well, I'm not gonna control him, Ray, you are. 'Cause if he f*cks up, guess what. You're going to leavenworth with him. You guys can share a cell. Now, get the f*ck out of here, and take that asshole with you. I said you could go, Donovan. What the f*ck are you looking at? Your mom. Hey, Ray, uh, I know how you got to Frank, but I don't have a second family. So I guess you can't f*ck with me. Couldn't let me live my life? You set me up, m*therf*cker. You knew this was gonna happen. You think I want you back here? Huh? Think anybody does? You know what? Some of these parole officers aren't so bad. Nothing I can't handle. Do what you're told, Mick, you understand? Sure, and if it ain't all right, I'll blow town, go back to Mexico. f*ck it. Go back to Mexico, you'll end up dead. Dead? You're getting paranoid, Ray. Drop your stuff off, and we go see that parole officer. What's your hurry, Ray? (Men grunting, punches landing) Boys. I'm back. f*cking funeral. Say hi to your dad. Hey, Bunch. Daryll : What are you doing back here, Mick? What are you talking about? You think I'm gonna walk out on my family? They just put me on parole, boys. I thought I was gonna go back to Walpole for a minute there. Here we go. Let's celebrate. He's sober, Mick. I got a job, Pop. Ain't that something! That's great, Bunch. That's great. Didn't we have fun down there? Come on, let it go. You got hit. It happens. The most important thing is to get back up. Got to keep pushing forward. Choo-choo-choo-choo, choo-choo-choo-choo. Climb the mountain. Choo-choo-choo-choo. I can get there. Yeah. I'm there. Victory. All right, get back to work. Ray. Don't leave. I know a lot of bad sh1t happened. But it'll be better. I'm stronger now. Everything's gonna be okay. I know it is, Bunch. I need the name of every parole officer in the Hollywood office and their social security numbers. You're an FBI agent, Frank. Figure it out. (Chuckles) (Chuckling): Ray, what are you doing? Seriously, Ray? Shh. Ray, sweetheart, hold on. Ray, no. No, I said no. I said no. I said no. I can't... keep doing this. I feel raped. Raped? You f*cking kidding me? (Sighs) I talked to Dr. Finkel about it. Do you even know how rough you are? My pussy hurts. I can barely walk some days. You told me what happened with that priest. We can't pretend it didn't happen. I want to be close to you. I do, sweetheart. Will you answer me? Woman : Mrs. Sullivan? I'm Kate McPherson from the Boston Globe. We spoke a few years ago. I'm writing a book about your son. Look... I want to tell your side of the story. I know he was a good son to you, and I don't think he would've left you unless there was some compelling reason. Do you know what that was? They say he was in L.A. for a few months. And I don't think that's true. Do you think Catherine was with him? I know she was in hiding with him for 20 years. I'd like to talk to her. Catherine... she always took me to get my hair done. When's the last time she did that? I got nobody now. Sully was the last one left. f*cking Mickey Donovan. Piece of sh1t. f*cking... rat. All because he was f*cking that nigger. (Sighs) (Phone ringing) Yeah, boss. Lena, I need you and Ivy to get me everything you can on Ed Cochran. What, uh... the head of the L.A. FBI? Yeah, I know who he f*cking is. Just do it. Be careful. Okay. Hey, little dude, what's up? Conor : Nothing. I'm at home. I'm suspended. Awesome. (Knocking) What you doing, kiddo? Nothing, dad. All right. See you later. Hey, check this out. Say hi, Conor. Hi, Conor. (Laughs) Whoa. (Ringtone playing) Hey, Tommy, I got to go. All right, little dude. Adios. (Snorts) Con, it's your grandpa. Hi, grandpa. You still in Mexico? No, kiddo. I'm back. What are you, between classes? No, I got suspended. Oh, yeah? Mendez, you're late. Get in there. I got suspended, too. What'd you do? I pushed a kid down the stairs. He broke his collarbone. You pushed him from behind? Yeah. Oh, Conor, I... I can't condone that. Can you come over? I would if I could. I got my hands full. I can't go anywhere for a few days until I sort some things out, but I'm at the gym. We got to talk this through. Mickey Donovan? Uh, just a second. I'm on with my grandson. I got to call you back. I love you, Con. Miss you. That's me, sweetheart. (Phone ringing) Ezra : Where are you? Trousdale. Trousdale? You're nearby. I need you to come here now. It's all happening, Raymond. I need you to pee in a cup for me. I might need some help. Enough with the jokes. Go pee. Listen, I got to be honest with you. I had a little drop this morning making a toast with my boys. I didn't know this was gonna be part of our visit. It won't happen again. All right. You get a pass this time. But we'll do it next week. Thank you for telling me. You're a sweetheart, Lupita. You and me are gonna get along great. You got real humanity in you. (Scoffs) Hey, Deb. Hey. Ezra just put me in charge of fundraising for the RGOCC. Congratulations. God, it feels great to be out in the open. Did you give these to Abby? Yeah, I did. What is it with her and Trousdale? I tried to get her interested in Brentwood, in the Palisades. She liked this one, huh? She fell in love with that house. We have a problem, Raymond. When I was sick, people didn't honor their pledges. We need to build now. June Wilson pledged $5 million, and now I can't get her on the phone. Leave her alone, Ezra. Leave her alone? Do you know what that woman owes me? Do you know the things I've done for her? I need you to go take care of this. She pledged the money. Now she's got to make it good. Could you excuse us for a sec? Of course, Ray. Listen to me. I've worked for you for 20 years, Ezra. Trust me, right now, June Wilson is the least of your problems. Is the FBI coming to arrest me? I'm taking care of that. Then what's the problem? I need that money, Raymond. Tikkun olam. All right. Man : Good job today, guys. Blessings. Beautiful practice. Tomorrow at 10:30, ashtanga level two. Okay? Blessings, everybody. Bye. Abby? You're looking at me like you see me. I... I do see you. Do you? Do you really see me? I do, Abby. ♪ (Exhales) Oh, my God. Cochran... he's on the short list to be the head of the FBI. Jesus. Credit reports for all the parole officers. What do you want me to do? That's the guy. Find him. Okay. Hey, boss? Boss. (Sighs) (Sniffs) Did you know your brother's following me? Did you send him? No. Look, I know who you are. I know what you did. I was there. That man is dead. I don't care how it happened. I need you to know that you don't have to worry about me. And I need to know that my family's okay. I can't keep looking over my shoulder. Your family's safe. I don't believe you. We both know what I saw. What'd you see? Are you playing games with me? What'd you see? I didn't see anything. Tell Terry to leave me alone. Frances. Frances, why won't you talk to me? Leave me the f*ck alone! What did you say? You threaten her? She came to me. Bullshit. Ray : The f*ck you doing here? Stop! Come on. Come on, Ray. Come... come... Come on. Stop! Fight me. Fight me! (Panting) I'm not fighting you, Terry. What did you do? What did you tell her? What she needed to hear. There's a body. We killed a f*cking priest... could get dug up any day now... and she knows who put him there. She's not gonna say anything. Oh, come on, Terry. She's got a f*cking family! She chose him. What more you need to know? How often did you see her? Once a month. She called every week. Always. And the last time you spoke to her? She called me on her way to California. She and Sully were in new Mexico. And when was that? A month ago maybe. Do you have a picture of her from the last few years? Yeah. I got something recent. It's her and Baby. She had a baby? No, her dog, Baby. Oh. Can I keep this? No. Oh, okay. Hold on. Just gonna take a photo. Mickey : See? Normal gym. This is where I sleep. I know it's a little tight for the two of us. (Laughs) Stop with the lip, Mickey. I had enough. 
 
 Conor! Conor, what are you doing here? You told me we needed to talk. How'd you get here? I took Uber. Uber? What the hell is that? Lupita, this is my... this is my grandson. He's the one in charge of keeping me out of trouble. Nice to meet you. Go put some, uh, wraps on. Maybe we'll do some bag work. I got to finish up with the lady. Okay. No, that's okay. We're done. I'll see you same time next week. You got to start to look for a job, okay? Sure thing. No problem. (Sighs) He's down 10k. Where is he? The large black man. (Sighs) Buy you a drink? I don't feel like talking. Rough day, huh? Are you f*cking deaf? I just told you I don't want to talk. So, I said... "Sheila, baby, what the hell do you want with a $15,000 wedding dress?" And she said, "daddy, it's so beautiful, and it's my wedding." (Chuckles) I mean, this kid has never asked me for a dime. Nothing. Paid her own way through college. Graduated with honors. You got a daughter? Yeah, sure. Love of my life. And it's all gone. I can't believe I f*cked up this bad. Oh, you stupid... sorry ass m*therf*cker! (Sighs) What is wrong with you, nigga? (Groans) $15,000. (Sighs) That's a lot for a parole officer. Who the f*ck are you? I'm Ray Donovan. Come here. (Clears throat) Come here. Oh! You f*cking asshole! See what that feels like? That's a bitch move. In the can, you do enough of those, and they'll shank you. You won't even see it coming. Sorry, grandpa. A good man feels bad when he does something wrong. You understand? Yes. All right. What did your father say about what happened? He was supposed to take me to the kid's house to apologize. Apologize? Donovans don't apologize. But you just said, "a good man feels bad when he does something wrong." But he don't tell no one about it. That's for you. You got to pay attention to what I'm saying. What kind of a man do you want to be? Who are you? You want to be a good man? A man who loves, forgives, embraces his family? You want to be a captain or a sailor, Con? I saw some tits today. Tits. Man, that's for babies. When you get older, it's all about ass. You know, Con, I met this woman. She didn't have much of an ass, but I liked her. She got into a bad situation. What happened? Wrong place, wrong time. It was a tragedy. Real tragedy. Ever have a girl die on you? Get to a certain age, they start dying on you left and right. (Sniffles) It's gonna be a great year, Con. Man : Hey, look here. I can take him away from Lupita. That I can do. But this other sh1t you're asking... I can't just make up rules here. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you going? I'm just trying to wrap my head around it, that's all. (Sighs) (Quietly): Sit down. I could go to jail for this sh1t. I put people back in the hole. I don't want to go there. Now, what is that? Yacht-master? Submariner? It's a Daytona. Oh, yeah. (Chuckles) (Phone chimes) (Phone ringing) Abby : Conor's at the gym. He's what? He's at the gym. How'd he get there? He took Uber, Ray. You got him an Uber account? I'm tired of being a chauffeur. They track the drivers. (Sighs) I'll go get him. Thanks. (Sighs) Goddamn it. (Sighs) Mickey : Jab, cross. (Punches landing) That's the way you're gonna hit? Bah, bah? Come on. You got to bing, bing! Let's go. Put some snap into it, okay? Jab, cross. You want to fight or not? I don't know. Jab, cross. Let's go. Oh. Oh, you are. You are a fighter. Now you feel it, see? That's... What's the matter? Let's go, Con. No! You told me you were gonna take me to that kid's house to apologize. What kind of man am I gonna be? Donovans don't apologize. You were gonna try to make me a bitch! Uh, let's get those gloves off, huh? Abby, me darlin'. Conor, let's go. Good work, kiddo. Welcome home, Mick. When were you gonna tell me, Ray? Listen to me. I went to Mexico and brought him back. I thought it was gonna be one day. Then they put him on parole. It's out of my hands. You think I want him here? I'm so f*cking tired of you lying to me. It's so belittling. I'm your partner. You keeping this from me makes me feel like a child. You don't want this to work. You don't want to save this marriage. I didn't know it needed saving. Maybe you should think about it. (Car door closes) (Engine starts) Kate : Sully's girlfriend  called her mother from New Mexico three weeks ago. She and Sully were on their way to California. That's interesting. The FBI has said that Sully was in L.A. For six to eight months. Don't you get it? Sully wasn't in L.A. six months ago. The FBI is lying. Maybe they went back and forth. How the f*ck do you know? I'm not sending you to L.A. I'm going, Bob. See ya. Kate. See ya. You're fired. (Phone ringing) Hey. Lena : Hey. Where are you? He just left the office. Heading home to Northridge? No, no, no, he's heading towards the airport. Hmm. All right. Stay on him. (Laughs) Uh... Why don't you go for a smoke, okay? All right? How are you? You in love again? No. (Chuckles): No. You want me to check him out? No. No, I think I can handle this one myself. (Laughing) All right. Hey, gorgeous. Hey, gorgeous, yourself. Hello. Louis, how are you tonight? Fine, thank you. Oh, good. Uh, this gentleman will have the lagavulin 25... is that right? Did I say it... Okay, good. Um... I'll have another one of these. Okay. Ezra wants his money? Yeah. He's really obsessed with this hospital, isn't he? It's his legacy. How much did I pledge? $5 million. $5 million? $5 million? I must have been drunk. You want me to check you in to that place for a couple of weeks? No. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. What do you want me to tell him, June? Yeah. I'm gonna have to sell my art collection. Slow down. Oh... The pledge... it's not legally binding. Legally binding? This is Ezra Goldman. Just what kind of man do you think he is, huh? I can handle Ezra. Oh, sweetheart, I love you, but... I don't think so. (Sighs) Wha... (Stammers) You want me to stick around for dinner? No. I'm more than good, baby. Just... go home. Good night, June. Good night. Play nice, chico. Carlos. Whatever. (Dialing) Yeah, I can't believe how f*cking easy this was. What? Cochran. He's at the Airport Inn at LAX. What's he doing there? Well, wearing a tight white t-shirt and a leather vest. What color? Black. Rock and roll or S&M? Uh, a little of both. Wait, with, uh... Tight ripped jeans and a bandana. He's got a young girlfriend. No, no, no, no, no. It's kinkier than that. Boyfriend? Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. He's getting something out of the trunk. What? f*ck, forget it. What? What is it? He's in a f*cking cover band. (Laughs) (Phone beeps) (Dialing) (Sighs) (Phone ringing) Hello? I want you to meet me someplace. Are you kidding me? Come on. You'll be glad you did. I don't know what's what anymore. Come meet me. I'm texting you the address now. (Door opens, closes) We're closed. They must have forgot to lock it. (Clears throat) Can I help you? You Mickey Donovan? Who wants to know? I'm Ronald Keith. I'm your new parole officer. Oh. I got lupita. You made a mistake. No, it's no mistake. You've been reassigned. Nah. You cannot stay here. This is a boxing gym. People gamble here. That's bullshit. It's a new regulation. Pack your sh1t. Let's go. My son owns this place. You come with me... or I'll violate your ass so f*cking quick, you won't know what f*cking hit you. Where am I supposed to go? (Phone ringing) Yeah? Ezra : What the f*ck did you do, Raymond? Calm down, Ezra. I just talked to June. I gave you a job to do, you didn't do it. She can't afford it. Not acceptable, Raymond. Not acceptable. What do you want me to do, Ezra? Beat her up? Mickey : Leroy comes home from school,  says to his mama, "mama, why do I have the biggest dick in the third grade? Is it 'cause I'm black?" She says, "who told you that, Leroy? That's racist. You don't have the biggest dick 'cause you're black. You have the biggest dick 'cause you're 23." (Chuckles) Yeah. (Sirens wailing in distance) What's this? Your job. Be there at 5:00 A.M. (Band playing Bob Seger's "Night Moves") Cochran : ♪ way up firm and high ♪
