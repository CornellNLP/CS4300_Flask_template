 Previously on  Ray Donovan... 
 Ray? I need to see you. 
 She's a reporter. 
 She's gonna publish an article that says I brought Sully Sullivan out here. 
 And I paid him to kill Mickey. 
 Can't you stop her? 
 Ray :  I could, but I won't. 
 You're hiding something from me. 
 Kate McPherson, you're a real pisser, you know that? 
 Ray Donovan, you're a real pisser, too. 
 This woman is gonna f*ck everything up, Ray. 
 You come after her or me, this goes viral. 
 Avi :  You are letting everything fall apart. 
 You let another man f*ck your wife. 
 And you do nothing abou... 
 Ooh! 
 sh1t. 
 Ray :  There's a body buried there. 
 Anything happens to Kate McPherson, that body comes up. 
 Ezra :  She's been warned. 
 She has to be stopped. 
 I've always needed you, I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Mickey :  He's f*cking around on you. 
 He was with another woman. 
 Allan and I, we have our ups and downs. 
 But we have a good life. 
 You got to lift me. 
 Were you ever afraid that you were gonna do something? 
 Please go. 
 How much would it be worth to you if I could put your father away tonight? 
 You tell me. 
 A hundred grand. 
 I'm locked in! 
 Get the f*ck out of here, Mick! 
 (sirens approaching) Where's Terry? 
 Just drive, son. 
 Ashley :  He's here again, Ray. 
 That creep who was stalking me. 
 Bob :  He's the bad guy, Ray. Not me. 
 He hits her! 
 I've seen it! 
 Bridget :  I was in the car. 
 And Daddy made me lie to the police. 
 I just got a call from my plant at Stalkerazzi. 
 Somebody's got a video of the Re-Kon shootings. 
 Cookie : Did you get it? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, when am I gonna see it? 
 Right now. 
 Where can I meet you? 
 My house. 
 Half an hour. 
 (explosion) 
 There was an explosion, and I think I broke my arm. 
 You almost killed your grandson. 
 (officers shouting) 
 I'll f*cking kill you. 
 Get the f*ck away from me. 
 Ray : It's alright, Con. 
 It's all right. 
 f*ck. 
 Hey. 
 What about Terry? Did you get him out? 
 He was arraigned this morning. 
 Bail's at 50 grand. 
 You pay it? 
 He refused it. 
 He what? 
 Yeah, he's still there. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 Money still there? 
 Yeah, it's in the trunk. 
 (recording): This is Cookie Brown. You know what to do. 
 Find Cookie Brown. 
 Tell him I need to meet with him today. 
 All right. 
 (grunts loudly) 
 What the...? 
 Jesus. 
 There's barely 20 grand here. 
 f*ck. 
 You mean to tell me Terry got locked up for that? 
 You really f*cked up this time, Mick. 
 That's not even enough to bail him out with. 
 Ray'll bail him out, don't worry about that. 
 They must have switched the dates for the pickup or some sh1t. 
 Something I couldn't have known about. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 How far is it to Palm Springs? 
 I don't know, about an hour? 
 You want to go see my mom? What, now? 
 No, Allan. 
 I said some things I shouldn't have. 
 I was out of line. 
 We're right here. 
 I want to apologize. 
 Mickey, are you crazy? 
 That man don't want to see you. 
 Well, you never know. 
 Come on. I'll feel better. 
 A bail is a promise, and I don't promise. 
 I'm a flight risk. 
 You don't want to be here, Terry. 
 You're sick. You need medicine. 
 I won't leave. 
 You're being ridiculous. 
 No one even got hurt. 
 I hit a man who didn't deserve it to get money (scoffs) Jesus Christ. 
 Story of my life, Terry. 
 Doesn't matter anyway, I'm... 
 I'm going to prison. 
 Armed robbery. 
 Maybe not. 
 There's things I can do. 
 Yeah, what, more of your dirty business? 
 You just sign the f*cking papers so we can get out of here. 
 I told you, I'm staying. 
 I deserve to be punished. 
 What are you f*cking talking about? 
 All of a sudden you're some God-fearing Catholic? 
 Yeah. Yeah, maybe I am. 
 What'd the f*cking Catholic Church ever do for you? 
 I'm sorry, Raymond. I believe. 
 And maybe you should, too. 
 Listen to me. 
 Mickey got you into this, all right? 
 You'd have never done this on your own. 
 You're a good man, Terry. 
 What the f*ck do you know about being a good man, Raymond? 
 I'm in trouble. 
 I might be going away. 
 I need you out of here to take care of the family. 
 No. I can't, Ray. 
 If you don't do it, Mickey will. 
 If you change your mind, call the f*cking bondsman. 
 Guard! 
 (phone line ringing) 
 Cookie : What you want, Ray? 
 You called me ten times last night. 
 You want to see the tape or not? 
 Oh, I already saw it, Ray. 
 Are you surprised? 
 Think you're the only guy out there working for me? 
 We need to talk. 
 Yeah, we need to talk. 
 But right now I'm setting up my son's birthday party. 
 But I'll see you later. 
 Where the f*ck's Avi? 
 I don't know, boss. 
 I haven't heard from him since 8:00 last night. 
 I want you to go to my house, stay with my family. 
 Okay. 
 You got a gun? 
 Are we going to Boston? 
 I don't know, Bridg, I'm thinking about it. 
 Why? 
 I thought maybe a change would do us good. 
 You mean you're afraid that Cookie's gonna kill me. 
 Bridg, stop it. 
 I'm not afraid of him. 
 He should be in jail. And I'm not going to Boston. 
 I want another pill. 
 Conor, you get one every four hours. 
 But it hurts. 
 Stop being a baby. (knocking) 
 Hey. 
 Mom, your boyfriend's here. 
 Conor : I want to meet him. 
 Is this the guy Dad said you could f*ck in your bed? 
 Wait here. 
 Stay there. I'm serious, Conor. 
 Look, I really need to talk to you. 
 Don't just show up here. 
 Your husband just got out of jail. We have time. 
 I don't care. That's not what it's about. 
 You don't come here. 
 I put my life on the line for you, Abby. My career. 
 And it didn't do a thing, did it? 
 It doesn't work that way. You don't snap your fingers and someone gets put away. 
 I can still protect you. 
 How? 
 We'll figure it out. 
 That's not good enough. 
 I was in L.A. 
 And I found out what happened to your daughter. 
 I wanted to tell you before you read about it. 
 She's dead, right? 
 Is that what you're trying to tell me? 
 Yes. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Did that f*cking prick Sully do it? 
 Yes. 
 How? 
 Mrs. Shaughnessy, I... 
 I don't know. 
 Bet you he strangled her, just like the other two. 
 Can you go? Now? 
 Please? 
 (keys jangle) 
 (muffled gunshot) 
 (distant music playing, indistinct chatter) 
 Hold up, Ray. 
 (scoffs) It's a birthday party, Ray. 
 Baby, wave to Mommy and Daddy. 
 You better smile, boy. (giggles) 
 I'll be right back. 
 Where my money? 
 I'll bring it later. 
 Why you ain't bring it now? 
 We got some things to sort out, first. 
 Let's go inside. 
 Smile, baby. 
 Sit down, Ray. 
 Where'd you get the tape? 
 f*ck does it matter where I got the tape? 
 We got a problem. 
 Snowflake is on that tape. 
 You want to kill me now, right? 
 No, I don't want to kill you, Cookie. 
 I just want to make sure you don't hurt my kid. 
 Boy : Daddy! Daddy! 
 Hey-hey! 
 Alfonse! This is the birthday boy. 
 Say hello to Mr. Ray Donovan. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 So what did baby girl say to the cops? 
 She told them the truth. 
 Marvin and Re-Kon were getting high, she got upset, they let her out at Sunset and La Brea. 
 She didn't see a thing. 
 Good. 
 So neither of our kids is gonna have to grow up without a father now. 
 That's right. 
 So we're good now, Ray. 
 But I'm gonna need that million dollars back. 
 I'll bring it by later. 
 What time you wrapping up here? 
 I don't know. 
 These little M*therf*ckers, they like to party hard. 
 All right. 
 (knocking on glass) 
 Pop, come on, let's just go. 
 I don't think he's here. 
 One more minute. (sighs) 
 There he is. 
 What are you doing here, Mick? 
 I want my f*ckin' money. 
 What money? 
 When we met, you offered me 500 thou to blow town... now I want it. 
 (laughs): You're out of your f*ckin' mind. 
 Get out of here before I call the cops. 
 You, too, you little sh1t. 
 You f*cked up my deal with Jerry Weiss. Get out your checkbook. 
 Okay. 
 You want a check. 
 No problem, Mick. 
 (quietly): Pop, Pop, you lied to me. 
 I'm getting what I'm owed. 
 (grunts) 
 Darryl : Oh, sh1t! 
 (grunting) 
 (shoes squeaking on floor) 
 (grunting) 
 (both panting) 
 (grunting) 
 (grunts) 
 Allan : Hey! 
 Goddamn, Mick. 
 (grunting, gasping) 
 Oh, my God. 
 Take it easy. He's moving. 
 Allan : Call the police! 
 You do that... he goes to jail, too. 
 Call 'em! 
 (pants) 
 (panting) 
 I never want to see you again, Mickey. 
 All right. 
 Fine with me. 
 Go on. 
 Get the hell out. 
 Both of you. 
 Let's go. 
 Allan : Go on, get out of here! 
 (ringtone playing) 
 Ray : Everything okay? 
 Yeah, it's fine. Everyone's safe. 
 Good. 
 Get back to the office as soon as you can. 
 Okay. (line disconnects) 
 I did something really f*cked up. 
 That girl I liked... 
 Patty... she has this kid, Clifford. 
 I hurt him. 
 She wanted me to take him out of the bath. 
 I went in there. 
 He was  naked. 
 I didn't want to pick him up. 
 But he kept asking me to. 
 So I went to do it... and he wrapped his legs around me. 
 f*ckin' freaked me out. And I threw him down. 
 I shouldn't be around kids. 
 Right? 
 I shouldn't be around  naked  kids. 
 What if... what if I hurt him the way I got hurt? 
 Robert : A lot of us feel this way. 
 Doesn't mean we're gonna do it. 
 Bunchy. 
 Bunchy, look at me. 
 You ever look at kiddie p0rn? 
 No. 
 You ever think about being sexual with a kid? 
 No. 
 You ever been aroused by a kid? 
 No. 
 Bunchy... you're okay. 
 Just because you were abused doesn't mean you're gonna abuse. 
 That's why we're here. 
 To break the cycle. 
 (spits) 
 Keep driving south. 
 We'll go live in Mexico for a while. 
 Make the money last. 
 What? N-No. 
 I'm not gonna live in Mexico, Pop. 
 I'm not on parole. 
 I have a job here, a life. 
 Well, what am I supposed to do? 
 I got nothin'. 
 Mickey, you don't have anything because you're a f*cking asshole. 
 All right? I said it. Okay, and I'm through with you. 
 Don't say things you don't mean. 
 We still got 20 thou. 
 It's all yours. It's all yours, all right? 
 You could start a little business. 
 Do your own thing. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Yeah? 
 Keith : That was pretty hairy back there. 
 You get out in time? 
 You're a piece of sh1t. 
 You happy you f*cked us? 
 f*cked you how? 
 Don't try to get over on me. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 I'm a long-time con, you f*ck. 
 Look, I won't tell anybody where you've been the last 48 hours, and you don't tell anyone I was in a pot store, but I'm gonna need a piece of what you got. 
 You ain't gettin' sh1t. f*ck yourself. 
 We're going to the races. 
 Hey, have you talked to Avi's mother? 
 She hasn't seen him yet. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm getting worried. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Ashley : Ray? 
 I just want to talk to Ray. 
 Please, I just need two seconds. 
 It's all right, Lena. 
 What happened? 
 I'm scared, Ray. 
 I think he's following me. 
 Steve : That fucker... is back, Ray. 
 He broke into our house this time. 
 Look at this. Look at... 
 Look at what he did to Ashley. 
 I mean, I-I pulled him off before he could really hurt her. 
 Didn't I... sweetheart? 
 I want to talk to her alone. 
 Come on, Ray. 
 We don't have secrets between us. 
 Who hit you, Ashley? 
 This asshole or Lepecka? 
 I told you. 
 Shut up. 
 That's it, Ray. 
 Get angry. 
 You're beautiful when you're angry. 
 Lena : Ray? 
 I need to talk to you right now. 
 Wait here. 
 Boss, I think... I think you want to sit down. 
 I'm not f*ckin' sitting down. What is it? 
 Kate McPherson is dead. 
 What? 
 They found her murdered in her apartment. 
 (softly): I'm sorry. 
 (takes deep breath) 
 Get rid of them. 
 Hey, I need you guys to go. 
 I feel your pain, brother. 
 (beeping) 
 Get this over to Marty at Stalkerazzi. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah, I'm sure. 
 
 
 
 Hi, Bunchy. 
 Hi. 
 Look... I made a mistake. 
 I'm sorry I kissed you. 
 Let's not lose our friendship over it. 
 All right. 
 Just... don't do it again. 
 I won't. 
 Relax. 
 It's not like I'm in love with you, Bunchy. 
 You sure acted like it. 
 (chuckles) 
 So, have you... have you talked to Patty since you...? 
 Nah. 
 Maybe you should talk to her. 
 All you did was try to discourage me. 
 Now you're trying to help? 
 That was f*cked up, right? 
 Yeah. (laughs) 
 (both laugh) 
 Let me call you back. 
 You murder women now, m*therf*cker? 
 Ray, just take it... 
 Huh? 
 (grunts) 
 What'd you do? 
 Step back. 
 What did you do?! 
 Step back now! Sir, are you okay? 
 Cochran : Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I'm fine, I'm fine. Just a little... misunderstanding, huh? 
 Leave us alone. 
 Okay, guys? Just get the f*ck out. Out. 
 Get out. 
 We'll be right outside, sir. 
 (sighs) God damn it, Ray. 
 I didn't kill her, okay? 
 I thought that you did. 
 You're a f*cking liar. 
 Hey, I had nothing to do with this, R... Hey. 
 All right? I got bigger fish to fry, you know? 
 I'm on my way to Washington. 
 No, you're not. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 Hey! 
 I don't have much time. 
 Conor's home with a broken arm. 
 What is it? 
 Why did I have to come here? 
 Come in. 
 Please, just hear me out. 
 Come on. 
 I want to show you something. 
 Just because I'm not gonna break the law doesn't mean I can't protect you. 
 What do you mean? 
 Cookie knows where you live, but he doesn't know where I live. 
 You want us to-to live here? 
 Yeah. 
 I know it's not Calabasas. 
 But we can have a life here. 
 I really love you and I want to help you, Abby. 
 Listen, I wanted to do it, I did. 
 I really tried, I just... 
 I had no right to ask you. 
 It's not who you are. 
 I should have known that. 
 Shut the door. 
 Sit down, Raymond. 
 I'm not f*cking sitting down, Ezra. 
 She was the  rodef. 
 We warned her. 
 You did as much as you could to protect her, but I had to step in. 
 I couldn't let her destroy us. 
 You sent Avi. 
 Of course I did. 
 You don't know who you are anymore, Ray. 
 I'm sure you convinced yourself you were in love with this woman. 
 Shut up. 
 It's all gotten away from you, and I needed to make it right. 
 I love you. 
 Avi loves you. 
 It's over, Ezra. 
 What are you doing, Raymond? 
 I warned you. 
 Yeah, I'd like to report a body. 
 It's buried at the Ruth Goldman Ovarian Cancer Center. 
 (quietly): Raymond! 
 Third and La Cienega. 
 Thank you. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Announcer (over P.A.) : Ladies and gentlemen, please note that this afternoon's eighth race is now being taken off the turf and will be run... 
 Mickey : Ronald. 
 Yeah, that's him, that's him. 
 (grunts) 
 (panting) 
 Oh, yeah. 
 There he is. 
 Get out of there, m*therf*cker. 
 Leave me alone. 
 I'm gonna count to five. 
 One, two, three... 
 (growls) 
 I trusted you with my family, you f*ck. (grunting) 
 Oh! 
 Ooh! (grunts) 
 (panting): Wait... wait... 
 (coughs) 
 The f*ck is you doing? Timing this beating? 
 How much f*cking money did you get out of that safe? Anything? 
 None of your f*cking business. 
 There's a horse in the seventh. (grunts) 
 Papa's Mustache. 
 Papa's f*ckin' Mustache... are you sick? 
 If you got anything out of that f*cking safe, we've got ten minutes. 
 Pop, you're not buying this, are you? 
 This guy's a f*cking degenerate. 
 He's lost the last three races on grass, but he's never lost on dirt. 
 He's a lock. 
 Mick. 
 He's beat up enough, for now. 
 Let's go see that horse. 
 I wanted to tell you when we first started to go out. 
 But I was afraid. 
 I'm really sorry that happened to you, Bunchy. 
 It's... It's awful. 
 No. 
 I'm okay. 
 Really, I am. 
 I-I go to this group... 
 Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. 
 They say it's a common thing. 
 You know that you won't do it... but you're afraid that you will. 
 But you know that you won't. 
 So, that's it. 
 Pretty much. 
 Thank you for your honesty, Bunchy. 
 Wait, can't we just... go back to the way it was? 
 (sighs) 
 I really want to keep seeing you and Clifford. 
 No. 
 Bunchy. 
 I... 
 I can't put my son's well-being at risk for something that you're unsure of. 
 But I'm not unsure. 
 How can you know for a fact that you would never do anything? 
 If you were that worried... there must be a reason. 
 Come on, Mick, this is all the money we got. 
 Let's just get out of here, already. 
 There he is. 
 Looks good. 
 He's gone up to eight-to-one. 
 Come on, you promised we could do something with that money. 
 Start my own business. 
 Linda : Mickey. 
 What? 
 Linda : Mickey? 
 I forgive you, Mickey. 
 I'm in a better place now. 
 What'd you say? 
 Linda : You are the captain. 
 (whinnies softly) 
 Number seven. 
 What about it? 
 What's his name? 
 Uh, The Captain. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 What's up? 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on, Pop, let's just get out of here. 
 Give me the money. 
 All of it. 
 $20,000. 
 Put it all on The Captain. To win. 
 sh1t. 
 Captain. 
 Jesus, Mick. 
 Son, trust me. 
 I know this is right. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Avi : Boss, we need to talk. 
 How much did he pay you? 
 No, boss. No money. 
 Believe me. 
 Some good cake, dawg. 
 (knocks) 
 You gonna shoot me, Cookie? 
 I don't know, Ray. 
 I don't always want to be looking over my shoulder. 
 Yeah. 
 I know the feeling. 
 I trust you, Ray. Ain't no need to do that. 
 I got people to handle that sh1t, you know? 
 How's this gonna work? 
 What you mean, Ray? 
 How do I know for sure... you're not gonna hurt my kid? 
 You don't. 
 (gunshot) 
 I didn't think so. 
 Drop it. 
 Drop the f*cking gun. 
 There's a million dollars on that table. 
 $500,000, if you split it. 
 A million if you don't. 
 I'll let you two sort that out. 
 (door closes) 
 (gunshot) 
 (playing "Call to the Post") 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Announcer : and racer number 7. It's a 6-furlong race... 
 I don't know, Pop. 
 Hey. 
 All right. 
 There it is. 
 There's the starting gate. 
 Darryl : You sure about this? 
 You'll see. 
 (announcer continues indistinctly) 
 Announcer : and The Captain on the outside. 
 Here's The Captain, the final horse, entering the gate. 
 Mickey : There's our horse. Look. 
 Announcer : And the flag is up. 
 (bell ringing) And they're off and running. 
 Mickey : Come on, Captain. Come on. 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on. (chuckles) 
 Announcer : The Captain... 
 Darryl : Come on. 
 Mickey : Is that him? 
 (announcer continues indistinctly) 
 He's in the pack. 
 He's doing all right, he's doing all right. 
 Come on, make a move, make a move! 
 He's right there in the pack. 
 Darryl : Come on, baby. Come around, baby. Come around, Cap. 
 (announcer continues indistinctly) 
 He's right there! He's right there! 
 Come on! 
 Keith : Come on. 
 Mickey : Where is he? 
 Darryl : Dude! 
 Where is he? It's the final turn. He's there. 
 I see him now. I see him. He's right  Keith : Come on. Come on. in there! He's there! He's there! 
 That's it. That's it. 
 Oh, yeah! 
 That's it! 
 That's it! Come on now! That's it! 
 Keep in there! Keep in there! 
 Come on. 
 Keith : Come on! Oh, yeah! 
 Keith : Come on, baby. 
 Mickey : Talk to me now! Talk to me! Come on! 
 Keith : That's it! 
 Come on. 
 Keith : Come on, Captain! 
 Come on! 
 Come on, baby! Make that move! 
 Use it! Use it, jock! Bring him in! 
 Use it! 
 Come on, Captain. 
 Use it! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Come on! 
 He's right there! He's right... 
 Please! Please! Please! 
 Keith : Bring it in! Bring it in! 
 Announcer : it's The Captain by a length and a half. 
 (chattering excitedly) 
 Shorty, did you see it? 
 Did you see it?! Huh?! 
 I told you! 
 (phone ringing) 
 (phone chimes on) 
 Ashley : Ray, I need you to come over right now. 
 What happened? 
 Please, I'm begging you. 
 You'll come, won't you? 
 I'm on my way. 
 (groans softly) 
 Mickey : What are you complaining about? 
 You'd train anyone who comes in that door. 
 (chuckles) That's me, bum magnet. 
 Mickey : That's who you are. 
 Terry. 
 Ray bail you out? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. I knew he would. 
 Where the f*ck were you? 
 I had sh1t to take care of. 
 For all of us. 
 (pills rattling) 
 We won... a million f*cking dollars. 
 Look. 
 Here's your cut. 
 Ter. 
 There you go. 
 Keep countin', Mick. 
 All right. 
 Since you weren't there to make the bet, I thought, uh, you'd take less. 
 But, uh, you're right, you're right. 
 I'm the one going to jail. 
 Now get the f*ck out of here. 
 What are you mad about? 
 You told me to make a run for it, didn't you? 
 Get out of here, Mick. 
 I don't want you here no more. 
 Buy some new equipment and get the floors fixed. 
 This place looks like sh1t. 
 (chuckles) 
 Where is she? 
 Steve : He was really gonna hurt her this time. 
 I need you to get rid of the body, Ray. 
 What happened? 
 No f*cking lying this time, all right? 
 I... He... (sighs) 
 Was he hitting you again? 
 Yes. 
 And... Bob tried to stop him. 
 It was self-defense. (chuckles) 
 He-he fell. 
 He didn't fall! You pushed him! 
 What the f*ck does it really matter? 
 I mean, what are you gonna do, Ray? 
 Are you gonna kill me? 
 Give me your keys. 
 Let's go. 
 I don't really care. 
 It felt good. 
 It was liberating! 
 I mean, didn't you ever kill anybody, Ray? 
 See? I can tell. 
 I can tell. You saw that. You... 
 He... You definitely have. 
 Get in.
