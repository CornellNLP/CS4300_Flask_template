 The old man made parole. 
 He wasn't supposed to be out for five more years. 
 He's out, Ray. 
 (gunshot) 
 How the f*ck did this happen, Ray? 
 He better not be coming here. 
 No lie lives forever, Raymond. 
 Deonte : She was doing blow all night. 
 She's dead, dawg. 
 Lee : Guy has a $200 million heterosexual movie coming out in a month,  picks up a tranny on Sunset Boulevard. 
 I didn't know it was a guy, I swear. 
 Ray : I got an idea. 
 We can kill two birds with one stone. Thanks for doing this, man. Suck one cock, you're a cocksucker for life. Get caught with a dead girl, admit to a drug problem, go to rehab, no problem. Stu : This chick has her claws in me. I want you to follow her. Ashley : What are you doing here, Ray? You have a stalker. (laughs) Terry : Bunchy had a slip. You want me to send someone? Nah, I ain't done drinking yet. You remember Dad's girlfriend Claudette? They had a kid. They what? Terry : His name's Daryll. You fall in love easily. Did you f*ck her? No. Stu : What a shame. Your husband f*cked my girlfriend. (bones crack, Stu screams) My father coming here? You let him near this family, everything we worked for... it'll be over. You're sick, Ray. You got a hole in your heart. m*therf*cker! You go near my family,  I'll f*cking kill you. You hear me? ♪ 
♪ (sighing deeply) ♪ Ray : Something important. Check Boston Homicide... anything involving a priest. Check the morgue and the coroner's office... last few days. In Boston? Yeah, Boston. Okay, boss, I'm on it. I'll call you as soon as I find anything. Thanks, hon. Mickey : There once was a bird of yellow bill. He hopped upon my windowsill. I lured him in with bits of bread And then I smashed his f*cking head. (laughs) Abby, me darling. Top of the morning to you. He never come home? What a setup you got here. Unbelievable. Stove has six burners. Yolks in the eggs? They're orange. Almost had to put sunglasses on to scramble 'em. (laughing): Even the chickens are happy here. Glad you like it, Mickey. Go get dressed; we're late. Can we spend the day with Grandpa? Come on, Mom, please, we already missed the bus. No, absolutely not. Come on, breakfast. Please, Mom. I said no. (dishes clattering) Eat some breakfast, then go get dressed. Oh, there's our girl. How's Bernadette today? She's fine. Is that your wife? She asked you a question. We never married. You guys still together? She passed. A long time ago. Not recent. All right, then. Great guns you got there. Thank the lady. Thanks. (phone ringing) Hello. Hey. Something came up last night. I stayed in town. Mm-hmm. I wasn't with that girl, Abs. Okay, fine. Okay, fine? We should talk. Agreed. I'm on my way. What, now? Yeah, now. Why not now? Hi. I got to drop the kids at school first. They missed the bus. All right. See you soon. Morning, Grandpa. Here's my princess, yeah. Did you get good sleep last night? Mm-hmm. Hey, Bridg, did you see that card for a taxi company? (Bridget and Mickey speaking indistinctly) I break up this love affair for a second? It doesn't matter anyway. Bridget, now! Yes. Ray : Why don't you ask her out? Nah. She's out of my league. What are you talking about? She likes you. I don't think so. She likes those big guns of yours. Get in the car, Mickey. I'll drop you at the gym. I don't want to put you out. No, it's fine. Come on. Let's go. Sometimes the cabs don't come. (hip hop playing) Where's Mickey? I ain't seen him. How long's this gonna last, Bunch? Hmm? The minute he's back, you start up again? Nah. I started before that. Terry : Come on, Ray. Early for this. Why don't you give Dad a chance? (scoffs) You don't have a f*cking clue, do you? Keep an eye on him today. All right. Thanks for the ride. (phone ringing) Lena : Lee's called ten times. Put him through. Hold on. You're on. Lee : Where the f*ck are you? I've called at least ten times... I've never seen the Pacific Ocean. Dreamt about it in prison. What color is the water? It's nice. Not blue like the Caribbean or anything, but it's... it's nice. Good. Sounds beautiful. I won't say anything to Dad about Grandpa staying over if we don't have to go to school today. You little sh1t. You blackmailing me now? The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. What does that mean? It means that you're just like Dad. He blackmails people for a living. Bridget, cut it out. You can say it, but I can't? I was joking. No, you weren't. Everybody be nice. Did you know you broke Stu Feldman's hand? So you think this is funny? He's one of our biggest clients. I want you to go see him at Paramount, get down on your hands and knees, and give him the best blow job his life! And then beg him to take us back. Shouldn't you be sitting shivah? I'm allowed to leave if there's a crisis. If a human life's in danger and so forth. It's called pikuach nefesh. You should know that, Lee. Someone's life is in danger? Yes, possibly. Who? A client. A secret client? I think breaking the hand of one of our biggest clients is a crisis. You know what else is a crisis? My f*cking partner losing his mind. That's a crisis. He didn't show up on set. He's locked himself in his house. He's freaking out. Did he say how they got in the house? He doesn't know. He kept saying they "breached his security." It's your father, right? What are we gonna do about him, Raymond? (sighs) We don't know it's Mickey. First things first. (phone rings) Yeah, Lee, what's up? You didn't think I'd find out Sean Walker didn't go to work this morning? Studio expects the star of their film to show up on set. It hurts you don't tell me these things. First Stu Feldman, now this. Do you know the penalties involved here that come out of our money? This is stretching my asshole to its... I can't listen to this. I'm in mourning. (phone rings) Hi. Ray : Something came up. Something always comes up. I got to work. We'll talk tonight. You okay? I can't really talk right now. Kids are late for school. I got to concentrate on driving. All right, see you later. We're going to Malibu. No school today. Really? Yeah, really. She was dead. Her eyes were open. But she was still there, man. Her soul was there. I could feel it. It's called the Bardo state. I read about it in the Tibetan Book of the Undead. It's a great f*cking book. What did you do? I walked over, opened the sliding door, and... let her out. It was beautiful. She flew away. (phone buzzing) (panting) (laughs) Wow. Where are we? (doorbell rings) Ray : We're at Sean's house. (doorbell rings) Come on, Sean, open the f*cking door. (beeps) You promised me this wouldn't come back. You promised me. You said you'd take care of this. And I meant it. Did you see how he signed it? "Good times"? I shot your f*cking girlfriend in the head, high on your father's coke, and then we sent him to prison for 20 years. "Good times"? How did it get here? How the f*ck did he breach my security? He said "breach" again. (phone buzzes) Hang on a second, Sean. Where you going? Just... it'll be okay. What do you mean? Where's he going in the...? Yeah, Tommy, what's up? Look, you haven't aged a day. Look how handsome you are. Who's Tommy? I just got a video. I think it's of me doing something I shouldn't have been doing. Like what? What are you doing in it, Tommy? I'm sucking dick, all right? (sighs) I'm learning a lot about my addictions right now. Listen to me, Tommy. Send it to me right now and then delete it. And, Tommy... don't tell anyone about this. You mean tell someone and ruin my f*cking entire career? I'm not stupid, Ray. Tommy, I need you to come back inside. We don't take phone calls during group. You know what? Just leave me alone. I'm not even a drug addict, I'm a s*x addict. Are you filming this? No, no. (laughs) Wow. Sean : You take a phone call when someone's threatening my life? What the f*ck is wrong with you, Ray? Who's more important than me? Ezra : Why did Mickey come here? What does he want? Who cares what he wants? We owe him. We don't owe him sh1t. He broke into my f*cking house. I can't go out. I can't go to work. I'm gonna go to jail. Listen to me. It's my problem and I'm gonna take care of it. We have to come clean. It's the only solution. Ruth would want that. Sean : You know what I think? I think it's a shakedown. I'm not gonna let that happen, Sean. Yolanda? No, you won't, Ray. You know why? (baby cooing) Look at her. She's so innocent. So pure. She's my little angel. You can't let anyone hurt my family, Ray. I won't. I need the security tapes for the house, Sean. She needs me. You know how much money I gave after Katrina? Yeah. Darfur? I'm a good person. I know you are, Sean. You know, I struggle, I hurt. I make mistakes. But I always do the right thing. I make this world a better place. And you've got to help me, Ray. I love you, man. Yeah. Smell her head. (baby cries) Yeah. Here, Ezra, smell her head. Smell her head. (Ezra mumbles softly) Oh, my, oh, my. I need the tapes, Sean. I thought we could start with an aperitif and then have lunch. I don't know what an aperitif is. Here, keep this. This whole place. You got to be kidding me. This is paradise. I've never seen anything like it in my whole frigging life. You see the tits on that one? Here. (laughs) That's for you. Thank you. That's for you. Come here, come here. (laughing): Mickey. Buy yourself something sexy. I want to spend some time with my grandson. What do you got? What the f*ck is that? It's Detox Number Three. It's all yours, here. (boxers grunting) I heard they got a bout coming up over at the Commerce Casino. I don't know, we'll see. It's got to be the right fight or you get hurt. Move your feet, hands up. Get your jab working. Again... you want to be a fighter, you fire the jab. Little pitty-pat-ass punches. Hey, I got money coming... I'll stake you. Nobody's staking anybody. I said we'll see. One, two, three, four. You're wasting my time. Think, move your feet. The jab is like a cane to a blind man, you understand? Where's my dad? I ain't seen him, Bunch. Well, you left with him last night. He said he ain't seen him. All right? Let's go for Christ's sakes. (punches hitting pads) (drawers opening, shutting) What you doing, Bunch? What does it look like I'm doing? Baking a f*cking cake? Let's dance, Ter... Sit down. I want to party. Where's Mickey? You lived without him the last 20 years. Relax. Oh, no, don't... (lock clicks) Oh, don't you... (thumping, muffled yelling) f*ck you, Terry. God, f*ck. Conor? You a fag? I don't think so. Met some stand-up fags in prison. Good guys, tough guys. If one of your little friends wants to give you a blow job, that's fine. A mouth is a mouth, but don't let anyone f*ck you in the ass. That's how you get sick. Thanks, Grandpa. Tommy : Are you filming this? Chloe : No. No. (grunting) Tommy : Whoo. (whistles) (chuckles) My film is opening in three days. Calm down. They want money or they wouldn't have sent it. We just got to wait for them to call. Um, no, we don't. I have her number. You what? I have her number. (chuckles) (sighs) What? I called her sometimes. Yeah. It... it wasn't always s*x. She had a nice vibe about her. Get her on the phone, Tommy. Right now? Don't we need to, like, call the FBI or something? Tommy, dial the f*cking number and ask her what she wants. Just like that? Yeah, just like that. Hi, Chloe, it's Tommy. (chuckles) Fine, how are you? Me, too. What are you wearing? All right, sorry. Chloe, what do you want? She wants a million dollars. Yeah, I know. And she feels really bad. Set up a meet. I can't leave. I'm in rehab, remember? For me. (sighs) (indistinct chatter) Mickey : She looks like she got punched in the face. She went a few rounds with Max Schmeling. (laughs) Give me a few minutes with your mom, okay? Here. Mickey, you're spoiling them. Let me do this. Means a lot to me. Say "thank you." Thank you. Thanks, Grandpa. Stay together. How's your marriage? Things good? That's private, Mick. Why does he hate you so much? I was a terrible father. Selfish. I loved those kids, but I f*cked up. My wife was dying, money problems, a lot of mouths to feed. I was a criminal... you know that, right? Me and some other fellas had a little thing going. Did a little too much... nose candy, even sold it. It was the '80s... what can I tell you? Very degenerate era. I done my time, Abby. Been in a cage for 20 f*cking years. I guess that's not enough for Ray. Now I'm out. The world is a beautiful place. Mick. (mumbles) I'm a sloppy eater. Someone broke into Sean's house last night. Find out how he did it. See if you can I.D. him. Yes, boss. Here's Chloe. His name is Steven Hunter. Arrested six times for prostitution. From Peoria, Illinois. Hey, bring me a sandwich, eh? What do you want? Turkey, wheat. Mustard? Yes. 
 
 (easy listening music playing) I've never done this before. I'm not sure how it works. You're doing fine. You got a name? Ray Donovan. Chloe. Probably wondering what a nice girl like me would be doing this for. Not really. Tommy's a nice guy. I feel bad. I got to look after myself, though. This could be my only chance I ever have to change my life. You ever want to change your life? What do you want, Chloe? Thank you for calling me that. I'm sure you know my name is Steven. Cops always call me Steven whenever they arrest me. So mean, you know? I'm not a cop. What do you want? A million dollars. That's a big number. It's nothing compared to the gross of Tommy Wheeler's movie coming out this weekend. Right? Right. The guy over there, tell him to get lost. He's my boyfriend. I'm gonna use the money to have a s*x change operation. You don't have to tell me that. I want to. You make me want to tell you things, Ray. Ray : So, why don't you tell me how you know Tommy Wheeler? Chloe : Girl needed help, he saw me. We got to talking. Ray : Yeah? Here you go. So, that's it? I say a million dollars, and you say "All right"? Yep. Maybe I should've asked for two. We done? I'm not a bad person, Ray. You're just in the wrong body. I like you. You say what you mean. I'll be in touch. Thanks. You get all that? Yeah, boss. (phone ringing) Yeah, Lena, what's up? Listen, you were right. There was a priest killed in a church in South Boston, but that's all I can get. They're being real squirrely about it; they won't give out a name, they won't give out a photo. I'll try to have something more for you by the end of the day. It's important. Stay on it until you get something solid. I will. Oh, Ray, uh, are the kids sick? What? Yeah, school called, said they weren't there. (beeps) (shutter clicks) Ah. (laughs) (phone ringing) Thank you very much. Bye. (ringing continues) Oh. You like that up the crack of your ass like that? It doesn't bother you? Mickey, you're embarrassing me. This is Abby. Leave a message, I'll get back to you. I got to know things, Abby. It's a whole new world. You can be my guide. (phone ringing) (ringing continues) (phone rings) Hey, Dad. Where are you? Where are you, Con? Malibu. Where in Malibu? We're at the Country Mart. Malibu is beautiful. So is your family. Raymond? What's going on? What happened? Avi : What are you doing? No, no, no, you can't do this. No, you can't do that. Get your f*cking hands off me, Avi. Give me the gun, Avi. No. You need to calm the f*ck down. You've been acting crazy since your father got here. He's got my family. Give me the gun. Think, Raymond. Think about it. You gonna go shoot him in front of your kids? In front of Abby? We'll handle it. We always do. Chloe : No! Aah! No, no, don't you... No! (choking) Shh, shh, shh. Have you shown it to anyone else? Have you sent it to anyone else? Never. Was there anyone else there that night? No. (techno music playing) (music stops) Hey. Here. (Chloe choking) Ray : We have you on tape, Chloe. You threaten Tommy Wheeler again, you're dead. You understand me? (struggling for air) Say it. I... Say "I understand." (struggling): I... I understand. (panting) Any others? (panting): No. I swear. (breathing deeply) You understand the path you're walking down? You need to stop giving blow jobs in the street. Stop doing drugs. This what you want for yourself? You don't know f*ck about me. I know, if you keep this up, you're dead. That's how it ends. (sobbing) You'll be all right. We done? Yeah. You believe him? What? We got everything? f*cking amateur hour. You okay, boss? I'm fine. Stop asking me. How mad do you think Dad is? I don't know, Conor. Why'd you have to f*cking tell him? Mickey : Everybody relax. He's your father. He loves you. He'll understand. Abby : You didn't do anything wrong, Con. I said it was okay. I sanctioned it. He doesn't know what "sanctioned" means. Yes, I do. Mickey : All right, let's all get along, okay? I don't even know what "sanctions" means. (laughs) Abby, my love, what does "sanctions" mean? (sighs) Stu : Go. No, I'm gonna... go. Uh... uh, I didn't leave you a drive-on pass, so... How did he get in here? Assistant : What? I didn't leave him a pass. Okay? That's your little girlfriend. Now she's my little girlfriend. You know why? 'Cause you broke my f*cking hand. And my wife left me. Now get down on your hands and knees... and apologize. Lee said you'd blow me. Are you done? Yeah. Watch. (panting on video) Jesus. That guy can really suck cock. He should give my wife lessons. Tommy : Are you filming this? Chloe : No, no. Is that Tommy? That's Tommy. You have a $200 million movie opening with him this weekend. What are we gonna do? Open your safe. What? Open your f*cking safe. ♪ Private eyes ♪

Mickey : Look at these mugs. Come on. (kids laugh) I love you. Bridget : Come on, could I just run in and take one picture of Bunchy and Terry for the family tree? Please, it's important to me. We stay two minutes, all right? Two minutes, I got it. Look who I brought home. Hey. T here's Bunchy. There's Uncle Bunch. Terry, the kids are here. Hey, don't weep on the kid.

What are you talking about? (Mickey speaking indistinctly) Is that him? Your new brother? (quietly): Yeah. Mickey : He is a good boxer. I trained him when, when he was your age. Talk to Bridg a sec, would you? Hi, I'm Abby Donovan. You must be Daryll. Yeah. Terry : Bridg, you want to take a photo? Mickey : I trained all my kids to box. Come on, come on, show him. Pow, pow. See, I trained him when he was your age. You know what we're gonna do? The same way. I'm gonna get you in here. Get the wraps on you. I haven't told my kids yet.

Nice to meet you, too, Abby. Bridget : Okay, ready, one, two, three... You are gonna be a boxer. (Abby laughs) Okay, here, you want to see? There's that one. Which one do you like better?

You need anything, you call me. You got my number. You want to talk about things... mysteries of life, anything at all... I'm a wise man. I learned a lot in the can. Okay. (sighs) You have fun with my family today, Mick? Sure. 20 years in prison. Must've been hard. Right? (scoffs) Now you're gonna spin some story how you didn't deserve it? (sighs) You deserved it, Mick. You deserve worse. You know what? I'm gonna give it to you. Ray-Ray. I just want my family back. No, you don't. You want my family. Never gonna happen. All right, come on. You won't see it coming. (metal clangs) (gravel crunching) Ah, Jesus. Who is that? My brother. Keep going. (gravel crunching) Avi : Oh, there's someone in the car. Yep.
