 [bird cawing] 
 I know it's early, crew, but we've got a lot to do on the Fireball. 
 It's not gonna fix itself. 
 Ugh, every time I want to fly, Kaz borrows her and brings her back broken! 
 Let's stop complaining and start by installing that new GX engine. 
 A new GX engine that's... already installed! 
 Uh, Neeku's right. 
 New engine, repulsorlifts, injectors. 
 Everything we had to do has already been checked off. 
 That's no big deal. 
 I wanted to get her up and running for you, Tam, just one last piece. 
 Well, I know you wanted to fly her this afternoon. 
 [grunts] There, finished! 
 Um, that's nice and all, but unless you want to kill the ship's power, you need to install the coupling the right way. 
 But with that said, thank you, Kaz. 
 Wow, your skills are greatly improving! 
 Seems like it. 
 Where did you get all the parts? 
 Oh, I made a deal with Flix and Orka. 
 In exchange, I'm watching their store for the day! 
 Oh, wonderful! Just try not to blow it up while you're at it. 
 [laughs] Wow. 
 You're getting a sense of humor, Neeku. 
 I was being completely serious. 
 That's good you're taking initiative, but are you sure you're not taking on more than you can handle? 
 Yeah! 
 I've got this. Come on, BB-8. 
 [beeping] 
 Good luck. You two will need it. 
 Do hurry up, will you, Orka? 
 Oh, don't rush me, Flix. 
 You have long legs. You move faster. 
 [door opens] 
 There you are, Kaz! 
 Hey, thanks for covering the store for us, buddy, pal, ol' friend! 
 -[chuckles] We owe ya. -Uh, actually, we don't. 
 We gave him the parts. Technically he owes us. 
 So, where are you guys going that you need me to run the store? 
 Ugh. It's a long story with a tragic ending. 
 We're visiting my mother. 
 Now, minding the store is simple, so pay attention. 
 Take their order, take their money. 
 Customer's always right, take their money. 
 When in doubt, take their money. 
 And concerning our pet gorg, Bitey. 
 If he gets hungry, feed him. 
 Just don't wiggle your fingers at him. 
 He'll think they're food. 
 Important! Do not sell anything from the back room. 
 No way, no how, don't do it! 
 It is either a weapon or dangerously destructive or both. Probably both. 
 So don't touch anything unless you plan on getting yourself vaporized. 
 Bah-bah, don't even look back there! 
 No problem. I can handle this. 
 Easy as Balarian pie! 
 Eh, thanks again for this, Kazzy. 
 We'll be back tonight! 
 [beeping] 
 [croaking] 
 Good-bye fella--[yelps] 
 [whimpering] 
 Ah, running this place won't be that hard, BB-8. 
 Especially with you as my assistant! 
 [beeping] 
 What? Oh, people like you. 
 I'm sure you'll be great with the customers. 
 In the meantime, I can see if there are any other parts that I can use to fix the Fireball. 
 There's gotta be something useful here. 
 Ahem. 
 Oh, hello. 
 Welcome to Acquisitions. How can I-- 
 Can of Premium Deluxe D90 Droid Oil. 
 Make it fast, kid. 
 Um, right away, ma'am! [chuckles nervously] 
 OK, I'm sure it's here somewhere... around here. 
 [thudding] 
 Ow! Uh, you said premium oil, right? 
 Yeah, kid, that's what I said. 
 OK, right! Right. 
 [thud] Ah! 
 [beeping] 
 Thanks, BB-8. 
 Here you are, ma'am. Droid Oil! 
 Have a nice day! 
 Look at that, BB-8. 
 First sale of the day. Nice work! 
 -[beeping] -All right. 
 Now let's get back to finding some parts. 
 Hmmm. 
 [coughing] Ahem. 
 Welcome to Acquisitions. 
 Welcome? Welcome! 
 I thought you were closed today! 
 Um...no! Isn't that a good thing? 
 Who are you, anyway? 
 You don't look like Flix or Orka! 
 I'm their assistant. Can I help you, sir? 
 My name is Teroj Kee. 
 I'm with the Mining Guild, and I ordered a phase connector several weeks ago. 
 A phase connector? 
 A very hard to obtain part. 
 Very expensive. Very rare. 
 Let me check the stock. 
 [beeping] 
 Sorry, no orders for Teroj Kee. 
 We have a phase connector, but it's in the back room and has already been sold to a mining colony on Valashar. 
 But you have one, yes? 
 As I said, sir, it's not for sale. 
 It's in the back, is it not? 
 Maybe I could offer... 
 Ow! 
 [wailing] 
 Oh! I'm sorry, sir! 
 Let me help! 
 Ah! My arm! 
 That thing almost bit my arm off! 
 Yeah, you can't wiggle your fingers around Bitey. He thinks it's food. 
 Look, is there anything else I can help you with? 
 I'll give you a discount. Even throw in the gorg! 
 Yes, perhaps you can still help me. 
 Um, I need three of those tool kits right there. 
 Um, ten laser lenses. OK. Mm-hmm. 
 And throw in a crate of those connector rods. 
 No problem, sir! Coming right up. 
 This is a huge sale. 
 Flix and Orka are gonna be thrilled. 
 [beeping] 
 My thanks. 
 I want you to hand-deliver the order to me. 
 Deliver it? 
 But I can give it to you right now. 
 No. 
 Bring it to my storage locker at loading dock 23. 
 It'll be... 
 [chuckles] easier that way. 
 OK, sure. I'll be there in a few minutes. 
 Thanks again, sir! 
 [ominous music] 
 Watch the store while I'm gone, OK, BB-8? 
 [beeps] 
 [beeping] 
 I know that guy was shady, but you know, there's something shady about everyone here. 
 =[beeps] =Yeah, I know that, BB. 
 So when I make this delivery, I'm gonna find out what this Teroj Kee is really up to. 
 I'll be back soon! 
 [beeping] 
 Ah, loading dock 23. 
 Must be his storage locker. 
 [music playing] 
 Careful there. 
 Wouldn't want you to get hurt. Yet. 
 Look, I don't have any credits. 
 Flix and Orka don't pay me. My real job barely pays me. 
 I'm just doing this as a favor. 
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, uh-huh. 
 Well, it's nothing personal, kid. 
 It's just business. 
 Let me out of here! 
 What are you doing? 
 Keeping you out of my way! 
 There's some leftover junk on dock 23. 
 Take care of it for me. 
 What do you want me to do with it? 
 Destroy it! 
 Drop it in the ocean! 
 You're the boss. 
 [storage door rattling] 
 Help! 
 [grunts] 
 Ugh, it's no use. 
 BB-8, you there? BB-8? 
 -[beeping] -I know you don't wanna run the shop. Yeah, yeah, I know. 
 Will you keep quiet for a second? 
 Listen to me! 
 [groans] 
 Teroj Kee locked me inside a crate on the loading dock, and I need you to get me out! 
 [machinery whirring] 
 [machinery beeps] 
 Oh, no. BB-8? Hurry. 
 [growls] 
 [beeps] [static hisses] 
 [whimpers] 
 [beeps] 
 Finally. 
 Now, where is it? 
 Ah-ha. 
 [laughing] 
 Hello, phase connector. 
 It's time for you to make me rich. 
 [laughs maliciously] 
 [music playing] 
 Hey! 
 Someone! Let me out of here! 
 [thud] 
 BB-8? Where are you? 
 BB-8, do you copy? 
 -Get over here quick! -[thud] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Ow! 
 Crazy droid! 
 [groans] 
 Get away from me. 
 [grunts] 
 [beeping] 
 [clattering] 
 [beeping] 
 [grunting] 
 [grunts] 
 [beeps] 
 Stupid rollie! 
 [beeps] [grunts] 
 [breathy laugh] 
 Now, where was I? 
 Nothing. Nothing! 
 None of this will work. 
 Maybe? No. 
 No, it won't burn hot enough, not without some kind of... 
 Lens. 
 [music continues playing] 
 Here goes nothing. 
 C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon! 
 [intense music building] 
 Ha![gasps] 
 Hey! What are you doing up there? 
 Wha--what are you doing down there? 
 What? I'm working! 
 Well, I'm working up here too! 
 So, um, get back to work! 
 Ugh, what I gotta put up with. 
 [grunts] 
 BB-8? 
 BB-8? Ugh, BB-8, where are you? 
 [beeping] 
 He stole the phase connector? 
 We gotta get it back. 
 [BB-8 beeping] 
 BB-8, if you can find out where his ship is... 
 Oh! 
 Never mind. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 [birds cawing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 All right, I found it. 
 I'm going after the connector. 
 [beeping] 
 I'm not doomed. Don't say I'm doomed. 
 I've been in way worse situations than this. 
 [bird cawing] 
 [furtive music] 
 [comlink static hisses] 
 [comlink chatter] 
 
 
 
 Stormtroopers... here? 
 Teroj must be working for them. 
 OK, maybe this is way worse than I thought. 
 I gotta get the phase connector back. 
 I can't let Flix and Orka down. 
 -[squeals] -You? 
 [croaks] 
 [muffled squealing] 
 [muffled yelling] 
 We have what we came for. 
 Let's not stay here any longer than necessary. 
 Get ready for launch. 
 "Launch"? Oh, no. 
 [engine roaring] 
 Not good, Bitey. Not good at all. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 No, no, no, no, no. We can't take off. 
 We can't take off! 
 Whoa, think, Kaz, think! 
 Gotta do something about that phase connector. 
 I gotta bring the whole ship down. 
 Ow! Ah! 
 Ow! Sharp-toothed little-- 
 [engines whooshing] 
 [croaks] 
 I've seen this kind of system before back at Yeager's. 
 This coupling should lead straight to the electrical systems. 
 If I can kill the power, I can bring the whole ship down! 
 [grunting] 
 [sighs] OK. 
 Need something to cut through. 
 Need something sharp. 
 [tense music] 
 [growling] 
 Bitey. 
 Come here. 
 Come here, Bitey. Come and get me. 
 [electricity crackling] 
 -What was that? -I heard it too. 
 Who's in there? 
 No! Get away from those, you little pest! 
 [electricity crackles loudly] 
 [explosions] 
 Whoa! Oh! 
 [all] Whoa! 
 Whoa--whoa! Oh! 
 Gotta get out of here! 
 Whoa. 
 [groans] Whoa. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [grunting] 
 [blaster firing] 
 [squeals] 
 [ship rumbling] 
 Steady. Steady! 
 [croaks] 
 -[groans] -Oh! 
 [grunting] Whoa! 
 Gah, c'mon! 
 [yelps] 
 [screams] 
 [squealing] 
 Bitey! 
 Escape pods. Yes! 
 [escape pod powering up] 
 Hurry! To the pods! 
 [groans] 
 Well, no one's getting that part now. 
 Poor Bitey didn't make it. 
 You gave your life for the Resistance, my friend. 
 -I will always remem-- -[chittering] 
 Bitey! You made it! 
 [squealing] 
 [sighs] 
 Teroj. 
 Commander Pyre. 
 I failed to secure the phase connector. 
 My mission was sabotaged, and the goods were destroyed. 
 That is unfortunate. 
 Captain Phasma will not be pleased. 
 Report back at once. 
 [sighs] There are days, and there are days. 
 Well, thanks for all your help, little buddy. 
 It'll be nice to get you back here where everything is... normal. 
 Oh, no. 
 -[croaking] -This... 
 This place is a mess! 
 -If Flix and Orka see this... -[beeping] 
 BB! 
 [beeping] 
 [beeps] 
 Maybe we have time to clean up before Flix and Orka find out. 
 [thudding] 
 [groans] 
 [croaking] 
 I really don't look a thing like my mother. 
 My father was part Gungan, you know. 
 Why can't you be honest about your father for once? 
 You know, Gungans don't have feathers, but-- 
 What in the moons of Gozgo is this! 
 Flix, Orka. I can explain. 
 [beeps] 
 Oh, you're gonna kid, before Flix here kicks you into next week! 
 Ah-uh, it wasn't my fault! 
 We were only gone for a day. 
 And we come back to this? Appalling! 
 Some guy came in here. 
 He knew you had a phase connector. 
 And when he wouldn't take no for an answer, he broke in and stole it! 
 Hm, did he claim to be a member of the Mining Guild? 
 Called himself Teroj Kee? 
 Yes! That's it! 
 I tried to get the phase connector back but, um, well, I had to bring the entire ship down and the phase connector kinda went with it. 
 [beeping] 
 You... you destroyed an entire ship rather than let Teroj make off with our merchandise? 
 Mm, maybe? 
 [laughs] Great thinking, kid. 
 That guy has been trying to steal from us for years. 
 No one should get away with something without paying for it. 
 You know, he must've been monitoring our comlink to know we were goin' off-world. 
 Ugh, slimy little womp rat. 
 So...what exactly is a phase connector, anyway? 
 Phase connectors are used to crack open asteroids and small planetoids for heavy mining. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so maybe you want one, y'know, if you're doing a little drillin', or excavatin', you know, that sorta thing. 
 Hmm. Good to know. 
 [beeping] 
 So we'll see you bright and early tomorrow for work? 
 I'm sorry, what? 
 Well, no one should get away with something without paying for it, right? 
 Yeah, you destroyed it. 
 So you either gotta pay us back, or work off your debt. 
 [sighs] 
 Looks like I'll see you guys tomorrow. 
 I'll send a message to Poe. 
 General Organa will wanna know that the First Order is after one of these things. 
 [beeping] 
 Do you think they're using it to drill more dedlanite? 
 Or something else? 
 [beeps] 
 I don't know, BB. 
 I think this is bad.
