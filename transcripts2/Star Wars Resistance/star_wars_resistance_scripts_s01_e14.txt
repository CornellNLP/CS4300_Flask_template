 [ships whooshing] 
 Clearly, you are not as ambitious as we thought, Kragan. 
 Your raids on the Colossus should have Captain Doza begging for our help. 
 I have lost more men and ships than this deal is worth, Pyre. 
 I want triple the money, or we're out. 
 Very well. 
 Then you will take something precious from Captain Doza until he relinquishes the station. 
 And what would that be? 
 Something that is very close to him. 
 [ship whooshing] 
 [tense music] 
 [holo device beeps] 
 Kragan. 
 You haven't reported in, Synara. 
 Spending too much time with your friends? 
 If I had something to report, I would have already. 
 What do you want? 
 Do not forget who your real friends are. 
 Now, listen up. 
 Tonight, I am sending Valik and Drell on a special mission. 
 They will be shipped to the Colossus in a container. 
 Make sure you are the one who receives it and passes it through security. 
 Mission? What are you planning, Kragan? 
 Just make sure you receive that container. 
 Once they are inside, get them into Doza's tower. 
 The tower? 
 It's impossible to get in there. 
 Security is too tight. 
 Just figure it out, Synara. 
 Tonight, we get paid, and you finally get to come home. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [adventurous music] 
 [mellow music playing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Yes! 
 Good game, Torra... 
 ♪ But not good enough ♪ 
 Synara! Hey! 
 [laughs softly] We never see you anymore. 
 Is everything OK? 
 It's fine. I've just been busy... working extra cycles. 
 OK, who's next? 
 Synara? Wanna take me on? 
 Oh, I know! 
 We could try out the new Drone-Blaster game I just got. 
 It's so wizard! 
 Let's go back to the tower. 
 I'll get the service droids to bring us some food. 
 That sounds good to me. What do you say, Synara? 
 The tower? Are you sure I can come? 
 Of course you can come! 
 I meant all of us. Let's go! 
 [ships whooshing] 
 [door blips] 
 [Buggles barking] 
 [device beeps] 
 [energetic music playing] 
 [gun whooshes] 
 [game dings] 
 [barking continues] 
 You have a lot of security for a place so remote. 
 Well, with all the pirate attacks, father even thinks they have spies stationed here. 
 Spies? 
 [Buggles whining] 
 Three out of five. Not bad. 
 -Your turn, Tam. -Sure. 
 I'll give it a go. 
 I'd probably increase security if I were him. 
 Oh, he's planning on it. 
 He's just been busy. 
 Busy with the First Order? 
 I see them coming and going all the time now. 
 Kind of strange, isn't it? 
 [gun whooshing] 
 [groans] Only two hits. 
 Your turn, Synara. 
 [gun whooshes] 
 Wow, Synara, you're some shot! 
 Pretty good for a salvager. Where'd you learn to shoot so well? 
 My-- my father used to take me hunting on Vanqor as a child. 
 Your turn, Kaz. 
 [gun whooshing] 
 Nice. 
 You couldn't hit the broadside of a space freighter. 
 -Stupid toy. -[beeps] 
 I'm a way better shot with a real blaster-sort of. 
 Not that I've actually shot one. 
 [holo device beeps] 
 I should go. 
 I, um, I have to work the late cycle tonight. 
 Thank you for inviting us, Torra. 
 Anytime, Synara. 
 My friends are always welcome here-- all of you. 
 If you wanna hang out, just use my security code to get in. 
 [soft dramatic music] 
 [ship whooshing] 
 I don't need a security detail. 
 I have my own droids for that. 
 [door whooshes] 
 Father, I just had the best time. 
 -You have to meet Syna-- -[sighs] 
 I'm talking business, Torra. 
 Oh. I'll leave you alone. 
 I'm sorry, I-- this is extremely important for the station. 
 I get it, Father. It's OK. 
 The First Order needs an answer, Captain. 
 You have been delaying the inevitable for far too long now. 
 And what happens if I accept your help and the pirate attacks don't stop? 
 They will stop. 
 You need troops to protect your station, not racers. 
 You need us. 
 Do I? My apologies, Commander Pyre, but I'll need more time. 
 [whirring] 
 [playful music] 
 [loud banging] 
 [robotic chattering] 
 -[beeps] -[chatters] 
 Hey, can you two keep it down? 
 We are finished for now, Kaz. 
 I believe the accelerator will hold-- unless it explodes. 
 We should go meet Yeager at the marketplace. 
 Maybe he'll buy us dinner. 
 I'll stop by later. 
 I need a few more parts from salvage. 
 [groans] Any excuse to go see Synara. 
 [chuckles] Come on, Neeku. Let's get some food. 
 I like food! 
 [sniffing] 
 [ship whooshing] 
 [door whirring] 
 [tense music] 
 [keypad blips, beeps] 
 [door creaks, thuds] 
 Ah, well, it took you long enough. 
 We've been waiting forever. 
 Stop complaining. 
 I'm taking a big enough risk just getting this shipment through security. 
 You're lucky no one detected you. 
 Just get us into the tower. 
 Why the tower? What are you up to? 
 Doza has something that we want. 
 It's gonna bring us more credits then we can count. 
 [chuckles menacingly] 
 [device buzzes] 
 [beeps] 
 I know it's late, but Synara said she's working the last cycle, -and we need those parts. -[unsure beeps] 
 No, I'm not just here to see her. 
 -[beeps] -OK, maybe I am. 
 But I can tell something is wrong. 
 She's been so distant lately. 
 This is going to be more difficult than you think. 
 -[confused beeps] -You've been here long enough. 
 You should know how to get around. 
 Those two don't look like salvagers. 
 And when in doubt... [chuckles menacingly] 
 Synara could be in trouble. 
 OK, just-- follow me. 
 [soft dramatic music] 
 Let's follow, but not too close. And don't beep too loudly. 
 [beeps] 
 [thunks] 
 [whirring quietly] 
 You getting a funny feeling? 
 Yeah. 
 Someone's tailing us. 
 -[toe crunches] -[muffled yell] 
 Let's move. Hurry, Synara. 
 Ow, ow! [pained grunt] BB, watch where you roll, will you? 
 -[apologetic beep] -Come on. We can't lose them. 
 You have the codes, right? 
 [keypad beeping] 
 This isn't a good idea. 
 Security is heavier now than it's ever been. 
 Your concern for us is touching, Synara. 
 Do us a favor and stand guard. 
 What are you after, anyway? 
 What is so important to Doza? 
 His little girl. 
 -[ominous music] -Torra. 
 [suspenseful music] 
 Break out the droid popper. 
 [sphere ticks] 
 What in Castilon is that? 
 [electricity crackles, explodes] 
 [droids groaning] 
 Hurry before they discover these four are down. 
 -[gun whooshing] -[laughing] 
 Yes! Yes, yes, yes! 
 [gasps] Whoa! 
 -That was close! -[growls] 
 You OK, Buggles? 
 Buggles? 
 [yipping] 
 Kragan, you never said you were going after Torra. 
 [menacing laugh] 
 She is worth triple the credits if we bring her to the First Order alive. 
 Why? Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because you are getting soft, Synara. 
 You see these people as your friends. 
 Get to the skiff and bring Torra to me-- now! 
 Ugh! Got to stop this. 
 Captain, four security droids have just been deactivated on level eight. 
 -Deactivated? -Yes. 
 I performed a full sweep, and it also appears that Torra is missing from her quarters. 
 We have intruders? Torra might be in danger. 
 Send a squad of security droids to search the platform. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [panting] Keep looking. 
 We'll never find her at this rate--[grunts] 
 -Kaz! -Synara! 
 Oh, am I glad to see you! 
 I saw you arguing with those people down at the docks. 
 Kaz, listen to me. Torra is in trouble. 
 -Someone took her. -What? 
 -Who took her? -Just follow me. 
 Please, hurry. 
 We have no time. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Come on, we've gotta go after her! 
 [ships whooshing] 
 You think I'm scared of filthy pirates? 
 I said, let me go! 
 Ow! [yelps] Hey! 
 Be a good prisoner, will you? 
 [confused chatter] 
 Call the tower. Tell Doza the pirates kidnapped Torra. 
 He needs to scramble the Aces! 
 -[button beeps] -Tower, this is... 
 Yeager's Repairs. I need to speak to Captain Doza now! 
 The pirates kidnapped Torra? 
 4D, scramble the Aces! 
 -Go! -Right away, sir. 
 Torra... 
 [alarm blaring] 
 You two bantha-brains are in deep trouble. 
 You can bet my father's sending every Ace to find me, and they will! 
 There they are! 
 
 
 
 BB-8, transmit coordinates to Doza. 
 [positive beeps] 
 -[explosion] -Kaz? 
 [cackles] 
 [panicked beeps] 
 I can't fire back. 
 We can't risk it with Torra! 
 [inquisitive beeps] 
 Plan? I don't have a plan. 
 We just gotta stay on them. 
 [engine sputters] 
 [ship whooshes] 
 [soft dramatic music] 
 Mission is a success, Commander Pyre. 
 We have Torra Doza. 
 Excellent work. 
 I'll send someone with your payment immediately. 
 4D, do you have the coordinates yet? 
 Not yet, Captain. 
 [ships whooshing] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Have them in my sights. 
 Negative, negative. It's a decoy. 
 There's nobody on those speeders. 
 Fan out and widen the search! 
 [lasers firing] 
 BB, we could use some backup. Did the Aces get our location? 
 [negative beeps] 
 What do you mean the transponder's down? 
 Fix it and send those coordinates! 
 Are you seeing this, BB? 
 Those are the two that were with Synara at the docks. 
 [stern beeping] 
 Yeah, I know you never trusted her. 
 I get it. I get it! 
 -[machine whirrs] -Ah! 
 You little brat! 
 What? I slipped. 
 What is that? 
 [ominous music] 
 Whoa! [screams] 
 [panicked beeps] 
 I know, I know, BB, but I can't let them take Torra! 
 -[grunts] -Ow! Ooh! 
 -[grunting angrily] -[grunting] 
 [grunts] I can't get us any closer. 
 BB-8, how bad is the damage? 
 [negative beeps] 
 Well, this can't get any worse! 
 [proximity alarm blaring] The First Order? 
 OK, never mind. It's worse. 
 [ship whooshing] 
 [dramatic music] 
 They're landing. Oh no. 
 They're in league with the pirates! 
 [beeps] 
 The transponder's working? 
 Get those coordinates out now! 
 -[computer whirring] -Finally! 
 Aces three and four, reroute to the new coordinates. 
 [chuckles] They got here quickly. 
 They better have our payment. 
 Good evening, Kragan. 
 Commander Pyre sends his regards. 
 -[gasps] -[grunts] 
 [screams] 
 He's going for the girl! Stop him! 
 This way, Torra. I'm taking you home. 
 Uh, thanks? 
 I can't believe it. 
 BB, it looks like the First Order is rescuing Torra! 
 [explosions] 
 [ship whooshing] 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Aces one and five, do you have eyes on the base yet? 
 -[computer chirping] -Yes, what is it? 
 Captain, this is Major Vonreg of the First Order. 
 Your daughter is safe. 
 I am bringing her to you now. 
 Aces, break off the attack. 
 Follow the shuttle and make sure Torra comes back safely. 
 Copy that. 
 [ship whooshing] 
 Torra! 
 Father! 
 They didn't hurt you, did they? 
 I'm OK. I-I'm fine. 
 Major Vonreg, we're very lucky the First Order was close by. 
 Luck had nothing to do with it. 
 We've been closely monitoring pirate communications in this sector for months now in an effort to quash their raids. 
 We're only here to help. 
 As I was saying, Commander Pyre was very concerned to hear that security was compromised and your daughter taken. 
 He has offered to leave you a small security detail at your disposal while you consider our agreement. 
 I'm not entirely sure that's necessary, Major. 
 These outer worlds can be terribly hostile. 
 You never know what can happen at any given time. 
 I'd like to see my daughter inside. 
 She's been through much today. 
 Of course, Captain. Good evening. 
 [wind whooshing softly] 
 [ship whooshing] 
 -What is going on here? -[beeps] 
 Yeah, I'm glad Torra's safe too, but the First Order? 
 It just doesn't seem right to me. 
 [beeps] 
 [ship whirrs] 
 [holo device beeps] 
 Kragan. 
 The First Order has betrayed us. 
 The deal is over. 
 What exactly does that mean for me, Kragan? 
 Hey, Synara. 
 Kaz? 
 Thanks for helping out with Torra. 
 She's safe now-no thanks to me, but she's safe. 
 Good. 
 I would hate to see anything happen to her. 
 Hey, by the way, we needed some parts for a repair job. 
 I came by last night to see you, but you were busy with those two... customers. 
 [clears throat] Yeah, it was, uh, a late-night shipment-- some salvagers from off-world. 
 Yeah, I thought it was something like that. 
 Anyway, I-I'll check with Yeager to see if we still need those parts. 
 I'll see you soon, Synara. 
 Be well, Kaz. 
 [beeps] 
 I know, BB-8. 
 She's either helping the pirates, or she's one of them. 
 [machine whooshes, whirrs] 
 [adventurous music] 
 [theme music playing]
