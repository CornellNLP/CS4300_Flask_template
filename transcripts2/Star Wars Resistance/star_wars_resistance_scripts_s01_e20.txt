 [dramatic music] 
 [Pyre] Residents of the Colossus, the First Order is working tirelessly to raise this station above sea level. 
 The Resistance insurgents who sabotaged the platform are still at large. 
 Stay in your domiciles until further notice. 
 Anyone not inside their home is in violation of First Order law. 
 That is all. 
 Pyre, you have Jarek Yeager in custody. 
 What are you planning on doing with him? 
 That is none of your concern, Doza. 
 The First Order has far overstepped its boundaries You wrested control of this platform through fear and intimidation! 
 It was by invitation, if you recall. 
 You asked for our help. 
 I doubt the New Republic senate will find what you're doing legal. 
 We are well beyond the Republic's reach. 
 Fortunately, they are not beyond ours. 
 Arrest him for insubordination. 
 -4D? -Yes, Captain? 
 Stop them. 
 [chuckles] Pathetic. 
 Throw him into the brig, along with his Aces. Now! 
 You think you can get away with this and the Republic won't notice? 
 -[handcuffs clicking] -This isn't over, Pyre. 
 You're right. It's not. 
 Kazuda Xiono and his friends are still down there, and it's only a matter of time before we have them. 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 [beeping] 
 All right, the First Order has Tam and Yeager probably locked down somewhere here in the tower. 
 We need to find them and break them out. 
 Then we steal this shuttle, make a perfectly timed escape, and fly to my home world of Hosnian Prime. 
 That all sounds rather difficult, Kaz. 
 We need to think rationally. The Colossus is our home. 
 What about all of the people stuck here, trapped under the control of the First Order? 
 [beeping] 
 We can't save all of them. Can we? 
 We can, and we will. 
 We're gonna bring back reinforcements and free everyone! 
 My father's a senator. 
 He's got all kinds of connections to the military, and with the evidence that we have now-- 
 Kaz, I know in times of stress, people have delusions of grandeur, but a senator from Hosnian Prime? 
 [laughs] Next you're going to tell us you grew up exceedingly wealthy. 
 [laughing] 
 Um... let's get into that some other time, Neeku. 
 Right now we have to figure out a way to get rid of all these stormtroopers. 
 But first things first, we are freeing our friends. 
 -[indistinct chatter] -Mmm. 
 -How was the food, Tamara? -Amazing. 
 I can't even remember the last time I ate this well. 
 [sighs] I'm glad. 
 You deserve so much more than this station has to offer. 
 Now, let's talk about your friend Kazuda again. 
 I've told you everything. 
 I had a feeling he was up to something, but I had no idea he was a Resistance spy. 
 And your employer-- Jarek Yeager? 
 [scoffs] There's no way Yeager's a spy. 
 He came all the way out here to get away from the military. 
 I beg to differ. 
 Look, it was all me. 
 Kaz has nothing to do with this. 
 I tried recruiting him into the Resistance, but he refused. 
 I'm the one who threw the Fireball into your sector. 
 No. 
 No. 
 He's--he's lying. That's... that's just Yeager taking the blame, trying to help Kaz. 
 Yes, he has helped Kaz on many occasions... because they are spies, Tamara. 
 Yeager clearly didn't trust you enough to tell you the truth. 
 They used you and put your life in danger every single day... all under the guise of keeping you safe. 
 So I ask you... do you think Yeager truly cares about you? 
 Okay, Buggles, I have an important mission for you. 
 I need you to go find Kaz and bring him to me, okay? 
 [barks] 
 It all checks out, but the turbines won't respond. 
 The platform has taken on too much water. 
 We need to find a way to raise it up again. 
 Mm... 
 Ugh, it's another one of those things. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 What are you doing here? 
 -[thud] -[grunting] 
 What was that? 
 CS-227, what's your status? 
 CS-227, come in. 
 [coos] 
 What is going on out here? 
 -[men shout] -[thud] 
 All right, that should buy us some time. 
 Oh, I do hope no more stormtroopers show up. 
 They are quite difficult to deal with. 
 So you guys can use these controls to open and close any door, including the outside hatches? 
 That's right. The shellfolk taught us. 
 This station controls everything. 
 I'm going back up to the tower. 
 But how, Kaz? The passages above were flooded when the Colossus submerged. 
 Well, then it looks like I'll have to swim. 
 [muffled beeping] 
 Come in, Neeku. You there? 
 Blowfish 2 reading you loud and clear, Blowfish 1. 
 We're not calling each other Blowfish! 
 Listen, we're almost at level 12 hatch. 
 -Make sure it's open. -[Neeku] No problem, Blowfish 1. 
 -Over and out, Blowfish 1. -[Kazuda] Ugh. 
 [gulping] 
 Huh? 
 What the...? 
 [groans] 
 [Kazuda grunts] Getting a little closer. 
 Oh, no. 
 Okay, the valves in quadrant D are secure. 
 Wait. No one else is allowed out here. 
 Halt! 
 Aah! Move, CB! Faster! 
 Come to papa. 
 Uh... [chuckles] I think I'm good. 
 [blaster fires] 
 Open the pod hatches on level 2, fast! 
 But you said to open the hatch on level 12. 
 [Kazuda] Yeah, I know what I said! 
 Just open the hatches on 2! 
 -The hatches on 2! -Not a problem, Blowfish 1. 
 Huh... 
 Now, which one? 
 [buttons beeping] 
 Where'd he go? 
 Neeku, pressurize the corridor, you got me? 
 Pressurize? But that would... 
 Just do it! Do it now! Do it now! 
 There he is. 
 [button beeps] 
 [dramatic music] 
 No! Not the lights! 
 [button beeps] 
 [groans] 
 [muffled beeping] 
 Neeku! Neeku! Pressurize the corridor! 
 Try that one. No, try that one. 
 Did trying that work? Ah! Maybe try that one! 
 [blaster fires] 
 -[Neeku] Uh, no! No, not that one! -[buttons beeping] 
 [whirring] 
 Okay, try that one. 
 [groans] 
 Oh, no, no! No! 
 [muffled beeping] 
 [grunting] 
 [gasps] 
 -[button beeps] -[loud whooshing] 
 Ah! 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 [grunting] 
 [groans] 
 Neeku, close the hatches! 
 -[button beeps] -[shouts, grunts] 
 [beeping] 
 [exhales deeply] 
 [laughs] We made it! We're safe! 
 -[beeping] -[laughs] 
 Whoo-hoo! Blowfish, you are amazing! 
 Kaz, did you mean Blowfish 1 or Blowfish 2? 
 Because if you meant Blowfish 1, then that would mean that you think that you are amazing. 
 But if you meant Blowfish 2, that would mean that you think that I am amazing. 
 And first of all, thank you, but second of all, I think we are amazing because we just succeeded in pressurizing the corridor! 
 Well, thanks, guys. We're going up. 
 I'll be in touch. Keep an open channel, buddy. 
 Will do, buddy. [chuckles] 
 Did you hear Kaz call me "buddy"? 
 That is a term of endearment in many cultures! 
 -Yeah. -This is fun. 
 What else can we control from own here? 
 Ooh. 
 A hyperdrive. 
 [clatter] 
 This way. 
 Flix? Orka? You in here? 
 [loud clatter] 
 [beeping] 
 I hear it, CB. 
 Flix? Orka? 
 [grunting inside crate] 
 [air hisses] 
 Mmm! Oh, that's such good bacon. 
 Mmm! 
 Oh, hey, Kaz. 
 Oh, great. You're here. 
 Do you have any weapons around to help us fight the First Order? 
 [chuckling] Oh, Kaz. 
 If we had weapons, do you think we would be hiding in a box? 
 Yeah, or stupid enough to use them? 
 I mean, that's the First Order, Kaz, not pirates. 
 Here, there's room in the box for you, too. 
 Come on, hop in. Let me scooch over. 
 Uh... what are you doing in there, anyway? 
 What does it look like, genius? 
 We're escaping. 
 Wha...? 
 We have been in here for days. 
 We're waiting for the First Order delivery service to ship us off the platform. 
 We're being sent to my mother's on Talivar. 
 This place is just too stormtrooper-y for our liking. 
 You realize the station's completely underwater, right? 
 Whoa. So they're not shipping us? 
 I told you this plan was stupid, Flix. 
 Don't worry, Orka. 
 We're gonna free my friends and liberate the station from the First Order. 
 And then you won't have to hide anymore. 
 Oh, yeah, sure. Whatever you say, Kaz. 
 -[laughing] -Good luck with that. 
 [quirky music] 
 All right, CB, let's head to the tower. 
 -[barks] -Whoa! 
 -[grunting] -[barking] 
 -Buggles. -[barking] 
 [grunts] What are you doing here? 
 -[barks] -What's the matter? 
 -[barks] -You want us to follow? 
 [barking] 
 Okay. Okay, okay, we're following. 
 Come on, CB. 
 
 
 
 Neeku. Neeku, come in. 
 Buddy 1, this is Buddy 2. 
 We made a most fortuitous discovery. 
 Not only does the station have boosters, it has a Class 2 hyperdrive. 
 The Colossus can fly? 
 You mean we're on a ship, not a station? 
 [Neeku] Technically, it's both. 
 That is great! 
 [Kazuda] Can you get this place operational? 
 C-can you get us in the air? 
 Well, Kaz, getting ships into the air is my specialty. 
 [Kazuda] Okay, do it. 
 Although keeping them in the air has been a problem at times. 
 Move it, Resistance scum! 
 Tam! 
 They told me everything, Yeager. 
 How could you? You lied to me about Kaz. 
 No. Try to understand. 
 I said move! 
 [groans] 
 Don't listen to them, Tam. 
 They're trying to manipulate you. 
 That's what they do. 
 Come along, Tamara. 
 You put me and Neeku and everyone in danger. 
 Tam! [grunts] 
 Tam! 
 Good to see you, Jarek. 
 [barking] 
 -Torra! -Kaz! 
 Thank goodness you're safe. 
 Good job, Buggles. You found him. 
 I'm glad you're all right, Torra. 
 [grunts] 
 Well, my father isn't so lucky. 
 They locked him away. 
 Yeager too. 
 I've been coming up with a plan to break them out. 
 Great! So what are you thinking? 
 We can sneak in from down here, through the incinerator ducts, which will get us into the tower. 
 The incinerator-wonderful. 
 Let's just make sure we don't get obliterated with lasers like last time. 
 [chuckles] Don't worry. The systems are off today. 
 -[beeping] -Someone's coming? 
 [beeping] 
 Whew! That was close. 
 [beeping] 
 [alarm blaring] 
 [alarm blaring] 
 Shut him up already, CB! 
 [dramatic music] 
 [distorted beeping] 
 [beeping] 
 [beeping] 
 [beeping] 
 Nice work, CB-23! 
 Only room enough on this ship for one ball droid. 
 -[beeping] -The alarm went off over here! 
 Agent Tierny, have you found Kaz? 
 Unfortunately, no. 
 And you're sure you have no idea where he his hiding? 
 For all I know, he escaped hours ago. 
 Kaz pretends he's an idiot, but apparently he's far smarter than he lets on. 
 I want to make you an offer, Tamara. 
 I don't want to see your potential wasted on this platform for the rest of your life. 
 What kind of offer? 
 You've always dreamed of becoming a successful pilot, have you not? 
 I mean, yeah. 
 I've always felt at home in the sky. 
 Well, if you come with me, I believe you will find the First Order can make those dreams a reality. 
 -You! -[gasps] 
 Halt! 
 No, you halt! 
 Wrong end. 
 [whimpering] 
 Aah! 
 [laughs] Wow, Kaz. That... that was almost impressive. 
 What do you mean "almost"? I stunned him, didn't I? 
 [beeping] 
 We need to find a place... [grunts] 
 [both grunting] To hide him. 
 [barks] 
 [both continue grunting] 
 Come on, let's lock him up in here. 
 [grunts] These guys are... 
 [chuckles] Always heavier than they... 
 [grunts] Look. 
 [thud] 
 There's a turbolift to the cells this way. 
 [panting] 
 Buggles, you go back to the room. 
 [panting stops] 
 -[whimpers] -Go on. It's okay. Go! 
 [barks] 
 Where is everyone? It seems awfully quiet. 
 Oh, it wasn't like this earlier. 
 Quiet is good. I like quiet. 
 Maybe luck's finally on our side. 
 So what's this transmission all about? 
 Starkiller Base is finally operational. 
 "Starkiller"? 
 -What is that? -I don't know. 
 But it sounds like the worst thing imaginable. 
 [crowd chanting indistinctly in the distance] 
 Today is the end of the Republic. 
 The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. 
 At this very moment, in a system far from here, the New Republic lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance! 
 Kaz, come on, while they're distracted. 
 This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate, to their cherished fleet. 
 All remaining systems will bow to the First Order and will remember this as the last day of the Republic! 
 [stormtroopers shout] 
 Fire! 
 [stormtroopers shout] 
 CB-23, what system was that? 
 [beeping] 
 Hosnian Prime? 
 [shudders] No. 
 No, no, that can't be. [shudders] 
 No! My parents! 
 My... home. 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 [theme music playing]
