 [8-bit music] 
 -[zapping] -[grunts] 
 Whoa. [grunting] 
 Ugh! [blows raspberries] 
 [groans] 
 [grunts] 
 I know, Buggles. 
 We've gotta get out of the Tower for a few hours. 
 [chuckles] I'm going crazy in here too. 
 [barks] 
 Let's see what Father's up to. 
 Maybe we can talk him into going out on a hover-cruise. 
 -What do you say? -[barks eagerly] 
 [laughs] 
 [ominous music] 
 What's taking them so long? 
 [sighs] 
 -[sighs] -Torra? 
 -Is everything OK? -Great. 
 Completely fine, Father. 
 I really love hanging out in my room. 
 Alone. By myself. 
 Did I mention alone? 
 At least I'm still allowing you to fly. 
 It's getting dangerous out there, Torra. 
 Far more dangerous than it ever has been. 
 I'm not just talking about pirates. 
 I know who you're talking about. 
 Ever since they started coming around, you've changed. 
 You've been way too protective of me. 
 I mean, I'm an Ace pilot. 
 I've battled pirates and marauders and-- 
 The First Order are far worse than any pirate. 
 I'm going down to the marketplace. 
 Whatever you need can be delivered to you. 
 What I need is to get out and breathe some fresh air. 
 You have a balcony. And try and understand, Torra. 
 It's only until the First Order are gone. 
 And then we'll go on a hover-cruise. 
 -I promise. -So many promises. 
 I need to get off this tower. Off this whole station. 
 -Torra! -[barks] 
 4D, make sure she doesn't leave her room for the next few hours. I don't want her near them. 
 Of course, Sir. 
 [device beeping] 
 [menacing music] 
 Greetings, Commander Pyre. 
 How wonderful to see you, Captain Doza. 
 Prepare the Tower docking bay. 
 We will be there within the hour. 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 I'm sorry, Torra, I'm afraid I can't let you leave for the next 3.5 hours. 
 But what if there's a pirate attack? 
 I'm supposed to be on patrol in an hour. 
 Griff and Freya will cover your patrol until the First Order leaves, Torra. 
 -But... Buggles really has to go out. -[barks] 
 We don't want him making a mess all over the place. 
 -Do we, 4D? -Oh, dear, no. 
 That was disgusting. 
 I'll take the creature out myself. 
 [panting] 
 I am locking the door for your own safety until I return, Torra. 
 I know, I know. 
 [mischievous music] 
 [beeping] 
 Too bad I figured out the pass code. 
 [chuckles] 
 [barks excitedly] 
 Torra Doza, stop this instant. 
 -[liquid dripping] -Oh, Buggles. 
 Why? 
 Thanks, Buggles. 
 -Well, that was disgusting. -[barks] 
 [ships whirring] 
 [foreboding music] 
 OK, BB, Poe wants us to find any info that connects Doza to the First Order. 
 Any ideas on how to get into the Tower? 
 [whirring, beeping] 
 The shipping and receiving door. 
 Good call. Think you can get it open? 
 -[both] [grunt] -[surprised beep] 
 -Kaz? -Torra. 
 Oh, um, I was just gonna deliver some, uh, ship parts 
 -to Hype Fazon. -Uh, do that later. 
 Let's have some fun. 
 Um, but I need to-- Whoa, you got it? 
 OK, the coast is clear. 
 -No security droids. -What's going on? 
 -You in trouble? -Well... 
 Father wants me to stay in my room while he speaks to the First Order. 
 Oh, wow, the First Order. 
 Um, [clears throat], um, what's that all about? 
 Hmm, something to do with the pirate attacks. 
 They wanna help clean out the sector or something. 
 I guess the pirates have been raiding their ships too. 
 [beeps] 
 Ooh, that's pretty. 
 -How much? -Five credits. 
 Oh, you're Torra Doza, the Captain's daughter. 
 You've got the money. That's 20 credits for you. 
 How generous of you. Thanks, but no thanks. 
 What? You can afford it. 
 -Hey, look, it's Torra Doza. -Oh, hey, Torra. 
 Oh, hi, nice to see you all. 
 So what's the deal with all these pirate attacks? 
 Yes, Doza just cancelled another race. 
 And now I heard he might impose a curfew? 
 [growls] What's that all about? 
 Whoa, everyone back up. Give her some room. 
 -[growls] -Let's get out of here. 
 [concerned beeping] 
 Say, how about we get back to the Tower? 
 Before the First Order shows up. 
 Sounds great. But I think we're too late. 
 [menacing music] 
 So, how's the First Order gonna help with all these pirates? 
 Mm, if Father signs this agreement, they'll patrol the platform. 
 Then, I suppose, the only flying I'll get to do is playing "Flight Simulator Squadron." 
 [ominous music] 
 Wait. You have "Flight Simulator Squadron"? 
 All three of them. Do you wanna play? 
 I'm thinking yes! 
 Come on, we can get some food at the Ace Lounge too. 
 [beeps excitedly] 
 This is our ticket inside, BB-8. 
 [menacing music] 
 Commander Pyre, welcome back to the Colossus. 
 Have you considered my offer, Doza? 
 -It won't last long. -I have questions. 
 How many stormtroopers would be stationed here? 
 Enough to stave off any pirate raid. 
 My soldiers are far more equipped for the job than your Aces. 
 And when the pirate threat is abated, how long until they leave? 
 It's difficult putting a timeline to these things, Captain Doza. Pirates can be so... unpredictable. 
 [tense music] 
 Why are we sneaking around? 
 I snuck out. I have to sneak back in. 
 [gasps] Oh, uh-oh. 
 This way, this way. 
 [lounge music] 
 Whoa. 
 I didn't know the Aces had an even fancier lounge. 
 [Torra] Not bad, right? 
 [friendly beep] 
 Torra. What is going on with your father? 
 He's been so secretive of late. 
 He's fine, just busy. 
 Even too busy for me lately. 
 Well, he better get the races going again. 
 It's been too long since we've seen some action. 
 Mmm, [crunching], mmm. [chuckles] 
 Mmm. Mmm! 
 [mouth stuffed] Oh, this food-- mmm! 
 Really, really good. Mmm, mmm. 
 Take as much as you want. 
 So I flew in and said, "You think you got me? 
 You can't handle the Hype." 
 Then I punched the sublight jets and whoosh! 
 Streaked right through Vargo's ring and crossed the finish line. Whoo-hoo! 
 [chuckles] And that's how I won the Sublight Star Five Million. 
 Am I an amazing star pilot or what? 
 Server. Another round, please. 
 Coming, sir. 
 -Hmm? -Kaz? 
 -What are you doing here? -Rucklin! 
 Where's my bantha milk? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I have to work a side job to buy a racer to replace the one you destroyed. Trust me, I'm gonna get you back for that. 
 -Rucklin! -Coming, Sir. 
 Come on, let's get out of here. 
 This place is starting to reek. 
 [tense music] 
 This way. Let's head over to my-- 
 This sanction will allow First Order to secure both your platform and skies. 
 We'll find these pirates and eliminate them. 
 To the benefit of both our parties. 
 -I will need time to review. -Don't take too long, Captain. 
 We expect your answer soon. 
 4D, take this to my office. I'll see Pyre out. 
 We need that data pad, BB. Have a plan yet? 
 [negative beeps] 
 Commander Pyre, allow me to personally show you out. 
 This way. 
 [ominous music] 
 Not that way. That's my dad's office. 
 Come on. 
 [barks] 
 Uh? 
 -[beeps] -[barks] 
 Wow, you've got all the latest flight simulators. 
 -[gasps] -Yeah. 
 Well, they start to get boring when that's all you have. 
 I thought being an Ace would be different. 
 But things have changed. [scoffs] My father's changed. 
 [barking] 
 I know what it's like to feel alone, Torra. 
 There's not a lot of people our age around here. 
 But we're friends, right? 
 And I'm gonna crush you at that Flight Sim. 
 I'd like to see you try. 
 [playful music] 
 [8-bit music] 
 [laughs] 
 -Watch out, watch out, watch-- -[grunting] 
 [grunting] 
 Can't beat me. That's why they call me Kaz. 
 Whoo! Best pilot in the galaxy, coming through. 
 [Torra] Whoa! [grunting] 
 -Ka-zoo. -[grunting] 
 All right. [guffaws] 
 -[door beeping] -Uh-oh. 
 -Yes! -Quick, hide. 
 Torra, you're back. 
 
 
 
 -[foreboding music] -[beeps amicably] 
 Intruder. Intruder. 
 -Intruder. Intruder... -Oh, no. 
 Intruder. Intruder. Intruder. 
 -[barking] -He's not an intruder. 
 -He's, um, a-- a deliv-- -Intruder. Intruder. Intruder... 
 No. 4D, deactivate attack mode. 
 -Intruder. Intruder... -Deactivate. 
 -That's an order. -[frightened beep] 
 Apologies, Torra. 
 [relieved beep] 
 But your father warned us of possible droid spies. 
 You can never be too sure with a ball droid. 
 [plush toy squeaks] 
 [scandalous beep] 
 -[beeping] -[barks] 
 [playful music] 
 Thanks for everything, little fella. 
 See you next time. 
 [foreboding music] 
 [droids clanking] 
 -[beeps] -Phew. 
 That was too close, BB-8. 
 OK, here's Doza's office. Anyone inside? 
 [negative beep] 
 OK, buddy. Get me in. 
 Captain Doza. [panting] 
 I need to talk to you, Sir. It's important. 
 I'm in the midst of showing my guests out, boy. 
 -Is there a problem, Captain? -Nothing I can't handle. 
 Uh, good day, Commander Pyre. 
 [menacing music] 
 What is it? 
 Someone's broken into your office, Sir. 
 I saw them myself. We better hurry. 
 [tense music] 
 [doors, device whirring] 
 [beeping, whirring] 
 [panicked beeping] 
 [panicked beeping] 
 I need more time, BB. 
 [beeping] 
 -[door whirring open] -Uh-oh. 
 Ah! 
 [light beeps] 
 [ominous music] 
 -Intruder, huh? -Yes, it was Kazuda Xiono. 
 -I saw him sneak in here. -So where is he? 
 No, he has to be here. He's hiding. 
 [menacing music] 
 [gasps] 
 That is private. Stop wasting my time. 
 Make yourself useful and empty my trash. 
 [sighs] 
 [light beeps] 
 Father, the Aces wanna speak with you. 
 Not now, Torra. 
 They wanna know what's going on with this new deal. 
 Please, Father, they have the right to know. 
 Very well. You are quite right, [chuckles] as usual, my dear. 
 [ominous music] 
 [light beeps] 
 [tense music] 
 -[gasps] -[beeps] 
 [sighs] 
 BB-8, look at this. 
 It's an old Imperial Uniform, isn't it? 
 [inquisitive beep] 
 Doza used to be in the Empire. 
 And now he's working with the First Order. 
 I knew he was shady, but this? This is bad, BB. 
 Really bad. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Ah! 
 [shushes] I'll get you out. 
 After you explain to me why you were in my dad's office. 
 It's a long story. I promise I'll tell you everything over a couple of blurrgfires at Aunt Z's. 
 Follow me. I know a secret way out. 
 No guards. 
 [buttons beep] 
 Wait, have you done this before? 
 Um, no. But it'll be fine. 
 -Come on. -Wh-- ah. 
 [whirring] 
 -[Kazuda] Great. Where are we? -[beeping] 
 -[Kazuda] This is a trash compactor. -[Torra] [playfully] No. 
 [giggles] It's a trash incinerator. 
 -[Kazuda] Incinerator? -[Torra] Relax. 
 Today's the third day of the second cycle, right? 
 [Kazuda] No, actually, it's the third cycle. 
 -[incinerator powering up] -It is? 
 [lights clacking on] 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 [whirring] 
 -That's not good. -[zapping] 
 [suspenseful music] 
 We gotta get out of here. BB-8, get that door open. 
 Ah! 
 It's fine. It's OK. 
 -Are you crazy? -It's just like a holo game. 
 Jump! 
 Ah! This is out of control. 
 [panicked beeping] 
 -[lounge music] -[buttons beeping] 
 [tense music] 
 Ah, ah, ah. Faster, BB. 
 Get that door open! 
 [exhales deeply] That was too close. 
 Yeah. We almost died. 
 That was amazing! 
 [bemused beep] 
 So now, why exactly were you in my father's office again? 
 Oh, um, right, I-- I just, uh-- I-- I wanted to see how the other half lived, so, um, I... 
 Hmm. 
 Kazuda, be honest with me. 
 Are you a spy? 
 [laughs] Me, a spy? 
 Wh-- Why would you think-- 
 Father found out you used to be a pilot for the New Republic. And I keep a very close eye on my father's business. So I wonder, what're you doing here, really? 
 I'm-- I'm not a spy, that's ridiculous. 
 I-- I-- I, uh-- I quit the Navy to become a racer. 
 -That's all. -[beeps] 
 -You better go, Kaz. -Thanks. 
 No. Thank you. 
 [stirring music] 
 [foreboding music] 
 [barks, panting] 
 Father. I was looking for you. 
 Ready for our hover-cruise, Torra? 
 It'll be nice to finally get you out of your room. 
 Yeah, that's for sure. 
 [barks happily] 
 -Hurry along, dear. -Sure, Dad. Be right there. 
 Who are you really, Kazuda? 
 [barks] 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 [theme music playing]
