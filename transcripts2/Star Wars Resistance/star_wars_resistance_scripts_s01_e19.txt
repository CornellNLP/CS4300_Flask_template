 [brooding music] 
 You are all under arrest for conspiring against the First Order. 
 You can't threaten us with false charges. 
 Prove it or get out. 
 Resistance spies were reported in First Order territory. 
 Have you ever been to Sector Epsilon 51-3? 
 I've never even heard of it. 
 We have visual confirmation it was this ship that intruded in our territory. 
 That sector is off-limits. 
 -Impound it! -[startles] 
 You can't impound the Fireball. 
 Tell them this is all a mistake. 
 Kaz? 
 Tam, it's--it's complicated. 
 Take them into custody. 
 [indistinct] 
 [beeping] 
 [spray whooshing] 
 [man] Blast him! 
 [blasters firing] 
 [beeping] 
 [grunts] 
 [both yelp] 
 Tam, over here! 
 [blasters firing] 
 Neeku! Open my office! 
 But you have said on many occasions never to open your-- 
 Just do it! 
 Okay! 
 This isn't right. 
 This is just a misunderstanding. 
 [beeping] 
 Don't let them escape. 
 [engine revving] 
 [men wail] 
 [beeping] 
 [Bucket beeping] 
 [panicked beeping] 
 -[Jarek] Bucket? -[warbled beeping] 
 Bucket! 
 He's gone. We have to go. 
 [Jarek] Tam, come on! 
 Tam! 
 Tam! 
 Kaz, get inside! 
 Tam! 
 Get that door open now! 
 Don't shoot. Don't shoot. 
 I surrender. 
 It would seem your friends have left you to take the fall, Miss... Ryvora, is it not? 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 Come with us. 
 But I'm not a Resistance spy! 
 Of course you're not. Cuff her. 
 Take her to the Tower holding cells. 
 Hey, stop pushing! 
 I can walk, you know? 
 [sparks hissing] 
 She didn't come. Why didn't she come? 
 She's confused. 
 We need to hurry, Kaz. 
 We'll escape through here. 
 I do not understand. 
 Why is the First Order trying to arrest us? 
 We are not spies. We are mechanics. 
 Right? 
 Actually, Neeku, it's time I told you the truth. 
 I am a spy, for the Resistance. 
 Now is not the time for jokes, Kaz! 
 Why are we being pursued? 
 [beeping] 
 No, Neeku, it's not a joke. 
 I'm a real spy. 
 And now the First Order is after us. 
 [uneasy chuckle] This joke is getting less humorous by the moment. 
 Shh, quiet, you guys. 
 [man] Secure this sector. They must have gone this way. 
 Move. 
 Less talk, more walk. Come on. 
 [distant engines whirring] 
 We have to do something, Father. 
 We can't keep playing along, pretending to be compliant with the First Order. 
 I'm doing what I can, Torra, from the inside, but it's difficult. 
 We need to contact the New Republic. 
 [doors whoosh] 
 Captain Doza. 
 I'm not interrupting anything, am I? 
 Oh, the First Order interrupting? 
 [chuckles] Of course not. 
 [Pyre] We've located a cell of Resistance spies on your platform. 
 Spies? Who? 
 Jarek Yeager and cohorts. 
 Only one of them was captured. 
 In custody? For what? 
 Sector violation, conspiracy, sedition, among other charges. 
 Was it Kaz? 
 We have his friend, Tam Ryvora. 
 But no matter. 
 They will all be found soon enough. 
 -[comlink chimes] -Security, prepare the docking bay for an incoming ship. 
 And who are you expecting now, Pyre? 
 More troops? 
 Agent Tierny of the First Order Security Bureau. 
 She will find out everything Miss Ryvora knows, one way or the other. 
 [doors whoosh] 
 This way. 
 We need to send a message to the Resistance. 
 -But first, we have to-- -Save Tam, right? 
 We have to go after Tam! 
 We will, but first things first. 
 We get a message to the Resistance-- 
 But that would be impossible. 
 The First Order has blocked all communications. 
 -We'd have to-- -[man] It's them! 
 [whimpers] 
 Go, go, go, move! 
 [blaster charges, fires] 
 [engine rumbling] 
 Agent Tierny. 
 Commander Pyre. 
 Have the remaining Resistance spies been found? 
 Not yet. 
 But soon, I assure you. 
 I want to speak with Tam Ryvora. 
 Perhaps our young friend could be of some assistance. 
 This way. 
 [man] Search this corridor. They might be down here. 
 -[yelps] -They are getting closer. 
 And I am feeling extreme fear. 
 Keep going. Up ahead, go left. 
 [blaster fires] 
 I'm pretty sure that leads to-- 
 [blasters charge] 
 A dead end. 
 -Surrender. -[soft whimpering] 
 -[latch squeaks] -[all wail] 
 [both wailing] 
 [both grunt] 
 -[metal thuds] -Ooh! 
 -[wailing] -[grunts] 
 Wow, that was actually quite fun, except for the landing part. 
 [groans] Agreed. 
 [Eila] Hey, Kaz. 
 Kel, Eila! 
 [yelps] 
 [body thuds] 
 So is it true? 
 You're really a Resistance spy? 
 How--how did you know that? 
 We heard you through the vents. 
 You guys are really loud. 
 Oh, for shame, Kaz. 
 You see what happens when you do not tell the truth? 
 These poor children have been deceived by your absurd joke-telling! 
 Hey, kids, we need a place to lay low. 
 Any ideas? 
 We know the safest spots down here. 
 Come on. There's lots of places to hide. 
 Guys? We can't keep running. 
 We need to rescue Tam! 
 Let me go! 
 I haven't done anything. 
 Release her. 
 Those binders aren't necessary. 
 My apologies for their lack of hospitality. 
 [binders click] 
 I have a few, simple questions for you, Miss Ryvora. 
 Do you know anything about the Resistance? 
 [sighs] No, nothing. 
 They are a violent and dangerous group, disavowed even by the New Republic. 
 Okay. So what does that have to do with me? 
 Have you had any interaction with Commander Poe Dameron? 
 Not personally. 
 He's a--a friend of Yeager and Kaz. 
 Dameron is a known Resistance agent. 
 He's destroyed several First Order ships in unprovoked attacks. 
 Okay, so she knows a pilot. 
 So what? Is that a crime? 
 We are simply trying to get to the bottom of this, Captain Doza. 
 These distractions are interfering with my questioning. 
 Please, this way, Miss Ryvora. 
 -Where are you taking her? -[doors whoosh] 
 Tierny! 
 [soft dramatic music] 
 [excited beeping] 
 -Bucket, you're okay! -[beeping] 
 Oh, thank goodness. 
 You had me worried, old friend. 
 The shellfolk snagged him in one of their fishing nets. 
 [low warbling] 
 Is it our plan to live down here forever, never again to see the sun, or the stars, or any other living being? 
 No, Neeku. 
 We're going to send a message to the Resistance, free Tam, and get the First Order off the Colossus. 
 [beeping] 
 Hmm, I agree. 
 That is a much better plan. 
 I am not sure how we will do it, but a good plan nonetheless. 
 [upbeat music playing softly] 
 [doors whoosh shut] 
 Would you like something, Tamara? 
 Droid, serve my guest refreshments. 
 I, uh... 
 This is not what you expected, is it? 
 I'm not a monster, Tamara. 
 Our goal is galactic peace through absolute order. 
 Nothing more. 
 [low beeping] 
 I know how hard it must be for you to trust anyone right now. 
 Look, this is all a big misunderstanding. 
 Yeager, Neeku, Kaz, they're not spies. 
 Really? 
 What exactly do you know about Kazuda Xiono? 
 He's just a poor kid from Coruscant who wants to race. 
 Poor? Is that what he told you? 
 Kazuda hails from one of the wealthiest families on Hosnian Prime. 
 What? Wealthy? 
 No, Kaz is just-- 
 A pilot in the New Republic Navy, who was recruited to serve in the Resistance. 
 Here, maybe his service record will help convince you. 
 I knew something was going on with him. 
 But Kaz, a spy? 
 No, no, that's not gonna work. 
 The communications blanket is too strong. 
 If we're going to get a message through to the Resistance, we're going to have to disable the jammer. 
 It's at the top of Doza Tower. 
 They've doubled security. 
 No way we'll make it up there without getting caught. 
 -[beeping] -[Kazuda] Hmm. 
 [low warbling] 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
 I've got a crazy idea. 
 What if we take on water and drop the Colossus under the ocean? 
 Oh... 
 -[beeps] -[low warble] 
 Sure, if you want to destroy the entire station. 
 -Are you crazy, Kaz? -Just--just hear me out. 
 [keys clacking] 
 [beeping] 
 We lower the entire station until only the spire pokes out of the ocean. 
 Then we just swim right to the communications jammer and shut it down just like that! 
 It--it's so crazy it's brilliant! 
 Or, it's so crazy it's crazy! 
 If we lower the station without closing the security doors, the Colossus will flood and everyone will drown! 
 Then we need to get a message to Doza to seal all the hatches. 
 Can you handle that, CB-23? 
 [beeping] 
 I--I don't know about this. 
 If we're not careful, the entire station will end up crushed at the bottom of the ocean. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [concerned beeping] 
 [beeping] 
 [both beeping] 
 [playful music] 
 [loud clank] 
 [sparks hiss] 
 [beeping] 
 Guess that passes for food around here. 
 [beeping] 
 [beeping] 
 I didn't call food service. 
 [beeping] 
 No, Dad, it's Kaz's new rollie. 
 [beeping] 
 -What's that? -[beeping] 
 -You want me to do what? -[beeping] 
 Kaz is going to sink the station into the ocean? 
 [beeping] 
 -All the way to the bottom? -[beeping] 
 -So only the tower remains? -[beeping] 
 You're sure it's the only way to get the message out? 
 [beeping] 
 This is the craziest plan I've ever heard. 
 I know! [laughs] 
 You're right, it--it could be dangerous. 
 
 
 
 [engines whirring] 
 Well, what did he say? 
 Do it. 
 We'll seal the hatches from here. 
 And if you damage my station, you better hope the First Order catches you before I do. 
 This is going to be so much fun! 
 [soft laugh] 
 Okay, okay. 
 First, we will need to decrease ballast and increase downward thrust. 
 [laughs] This is exciting! 
 I appear to be tingling all over. 
 All right, shutting down the main turbines in three, two, one, now! 
 [electrical powering down] 
 [rumbling slows, stops] 
 [beep] 
 [whooshing slows, stops] 
 [screeching slows, stops] 
 [suspenseful music] 
 Do you think it's gonna sink? 
 Kaz, if there's one thing I believe you can do, it's sink this station. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 -[loud rumbling] -[squawks] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [mechanical hissing] 
 -[items clattering softly] -[grunts] 
 What--what's going on? 
 Stay here. I'm going to find out. 
 [beeping] 
 [items clatter] 
 Captain Doza! What is happening? 
 It must be a reactor malfunction. 
 We're sinking. 
 We've got to seal the hatches or the entire platform will be flooded. 
 Do it. And lock down our ships. 
 -[comlink chimes] -Attention, citizens. 
 -Evacuate docks and admissions. -[wails] 
 Move inside to all emergency pressurized rooms immediately! 
 This is not a drill! 
 [barks] 
 -[grunts] Buggles! -[yelps] 
 This isn't as fun as I thought it would be. 
 Emergency sealing all bulkheads. 
 [loud clanking] 
 [beeping] 
 [alarms blaring] 
 Inner hatch sealed. 
 Pressuring launch tube. 
 Opening outer hatch. 
 Have fun! 
 [water whooshing] 
 I don't know about this plan. 
 It's too late to change it. 
 [structural rumbling] 
 She held. She held! 
 How long until we can fix this, Captain? 
 -I'll check in now. -[comlink chimes] 
 Doza to engineering. What's the status? 
 -Frankly, Pyre... -[Doza speaking indistinctly] 
 I find the timing of this "accident" suspicious, especially with three Resistance agents running amok. 
 I was thinking the exact same thing, Tierny. 
 [gasping] 
 -[beeping] -[both gasping] 
 [Jarek] We're not there yet. 
 All right, come on. Come on. 
 Let's go. We don't have much time. 
 [groans] Not working. 
 [grunts] 
 Come on. 
 Just have to break... the connection. 
 [metal creaking] 
 [beep] 
 [electrical powering down] 
 [dramatic musical flourish] 
 [click] 
 Hmm, we've taken on too much water. 
 -I can't raise the station. -[comlink chimes] 
 [man through comlink] Commander, the communications blanket has gone offline. 
 It must be water damage. 
 [dramatic music] 
 It's still above sea level. 
 We'll get to the bottom of this. 
 Troopers, with me. 
 [mechanical clanking] 
 [mechanical whir] 
 [beeping] 
 CB, get this message to General Organa. 
 [beeping] 
 This is Kazuda Xiono of the Colossus. 
 The First Order has taken complete control of this station. 
 We are under total lockdown and in danger. 
 Please, send help immediately. 
 Now, Kaz, I know you're not the most experienced spy, but I'd fight alongside you any day. 
 [dramatic music] 
 Hopefully including today. 
 [blaster fires] 
 -[beeping] -Yeager! 
 We got a message coming in from the Resistance! 
 Can you get it, CB? I'll cover you. 
 [blaster firing] 
 Blast them! 
 Faster, 23! 
 [beeping] 
 Message received? 
 Nice work, CB. 
 [yelps] [grunts] 
 We did it, Yeager! 
 Good job, Kaz. 
 [Kazuda] Yeager, no! [screams] 
 [beeping] 
 Go, CB, help them. 
 [beeping] 
 Get him inside now! 
 [birds squawking] 
 [ominous music] 
 Captain, I just intercepted a coded transmission from the Colossus. 
 Unscramble it. 
 [beeping] 
 [Kazuda] This is Kazuda Xiono of the Colossus. 
 The First Order has taken complete control of this station. 
 We are under total lockdown and in danger. 
 Please-- send help immediately. 
 [beeping] 
 [gasping] 
 Kaz! CB-23! 
 Where is Yeager? 
 [somber dramatic music] 
 They captured him. 
 Wha-- but-- What about the Resistance? 
 Can they help us? 
 The message. 
 CB-23, did you download it all? 
 [beeping] 
 Kazuda. 
 I have received your message. 
 Our forces are few and divided and, as much as it pains me to say, we have no ships to spare. 
 I'm sending the coordinates to the location of our next base. 
 If you can leave Castilon, join us. 
 You should know that throughout the galaxy, many people are fighting oppression in any way they can. 
 You are not alone, Kazuda. 
 May the Force be with you. 
 So, you really are with the Resistance? 
 Why didn't you tell me, Kaz? 
 The Resistance isn't coming? 
 We're alone? 
 No. We have each other. 
 We are the Resistance now-- All of us. 
 First, we're going to free our friends. 
 Then, I promise you, we're taking back the Colossus. 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 [theme music playing]
