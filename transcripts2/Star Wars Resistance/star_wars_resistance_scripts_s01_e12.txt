 [light orchestral music] 
 Kaz, you're just in time. We're bringing it up now. 
 You said you were looking for some parts for the Fireball. 
 Well, this might be your ticket. 
 Oh, it's a Z-95. Maybe so. 
 Actually, it's a Z-96. 
 See, I know why you think that, Neeku, but the markings on this ship are clearly from Reaper Squadron. 
 See, in the Clone Wars, they never used the Z-96. 
 -Only the Z-95. -Wow. 
 You know your military history, Kaz. 
 Yeah, uh, well, I, uh-- [chuckles] 
 -Lunch? -Mm... 
 Look, you're helping me out, so I'm helping you out. 
 Brought you some food. 
 Oh, I-- I really don't have time for that. 
 -I like food. -Not now, Neeku. 
 [gurgling] 
 [sniffs] Ugh. 
 Ah. 
 [gurgling] 
 What is that? 
 [gurgling curiously] 
 Whatever it is, it's ugly and it reeks. 
 Oh! Hey, that's my lunch. Get off! 
 Ah, don't touch it. 
 [grunts, gurgling] 
 That's beyond disgusting. 
 Far, far beyond. 
 No, it is joy. 
 It is purest rapture. 
 And it looks just like the moggolvee pet I had as a hatchling back home. 
 Ha, ha, ha. 
 Oh, I shall name you Bibo, and you shall be my friend forever. 
 Oh, he kisses back. 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 [instrumental music playing] 
 [gurgling, whining] 
 No, Bibo, no. You stay put, little friend. 
 [grunts] 
 Bibo. 
 Ugh, great. 
 Got out again. 
 Oh, poor Bibo. He's merely hungry. 
 He eats literally anything. 
 Engine parts, tools, ship fuel. 
 Look, he's even trying to eat Bucket. 
 [laughs] No, Bibo, not food. 
 Not food, Bibo. 
 [whirs] 
 Now, now, Bibo, back to your home. 
 Can't you have that thing, I don't know, de-scented or something? 
 It is his natural musk, Kaz. 
 Which, by the way, I find far more pleasant than yours. 
 [laughs] I completely agree. 
 [sniffing] Yeah, real funny. 
 Just keep that thing-- away! 
 [gurgling] 
 What is happening in here? 
 What? 
 Oh. 
 I try to keep my rules few and clear. 
 Yeager's Garage Rule Number Seven is "No pets." 
 But-- but-- but I shall care for Bibo as my own body. 
 He may have my bunk, my rations, my weekly payment. Please, please, please, please, -please, please, please, please. -Uh, uh, ju-- [sighs] 
 Just make sure he doesn't get out again. 
 One more incident and he goes. 
 [giggling gleefully] 
 And turn on the fan. This place reeks. 
 Ugh, that stabilizer Synara gave you from the Z-95 would've worked, but it's corroded. 
 Hmm. I'll go back down there and check with Synara. 
 See if she can find another one. 
 [ominous music playing] 
 [Kragan] Synara, you missed your last report. 
 I have been busy spying, Kragan. What do you want? 
 I have some intel on your rescuers. 
 The two pilots who brought you there, turns out they're with the Resistance. 
 The Resistance? Are you sure? 
 Take a close look. 
 Do you recognize them? 
 Mm. It's hard to tell. 
 There you are. 
 -Who was that? -Oh, just another salvager. 
 So, Kaz, this Reaper Squadron you talked about, you think there would be any more fighters out there? 
 Uh, it's hard to say. Possibly. 
 Well, I've got one last salvage run for today. 
 Wanna come help me look? 
 [engine whirring] 
 [birds squawking] 
 [sloshing] 
 [rattling, clanking] 
 Uh, there. 
 I am certain that this will keep little Bibo in his-- 
 [clinking] 
 [inquisitive beeping] 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 Oh, no. He's out again? 
 Yeager will be displeased. 
 [excited gurgling] 
 Hey, get off my ship, you smelly snurg. 
 Here, fetch. 
 [excited gurgling] 
 [grunts] 
 [squeals] 
 [whirring, beeping] 
 [squeals] 
 Ah, that thing goes. 
 Now. 
 -Then so do I. -[gasps] 
 -[bemused beep] -What? 
 What did you say? 
 With all due respect, sir, I have asked nothing of you in all my years of service. 
 But if you reject Bibo, my precious little Bibo, I... I shall leave your employ. 
 Bibo, smallest friend, come back. 
 Not you too. 
 I'm not shutting down the garage over a blob of jelly. 
 Cut him a break. 
 He cares about that creature, Yeager. 
 We always help Kaz out, and he's done far crazier stuff than this. 
 [foreboding music playing] 
 [birds squawking] 
 [engine whirring] 
 [grunts] Man, salvaging, it's exhausting work. I am beat. 
 We've only been out here for 15 minutes, Kaz. 
 -Oh, right. -Kaz. 
 I've been meaning to ask, when I was knocked out on that freighter, who were those pilots who rescued me? 
 Well, I don't know, there's not much to say. 
 They're just pilots. You know how pilots are. 
 Except one of them was kind of handsome. 
 -But that's not important. -I'd like to thank them. 
 I feel indebted to them. 
 But they're-- they're long gone. 
 [engine shuts down] 
 I think I know who you really are, Kaz. 
 You-- you do? 
 You're someone who likes to keep secrets. 
 -Much like me. -Me? Keep secrets? 
 I don't keep secrets. I'm-- I'm not even interested in secrets. 
 I'm not the secretive kind at all, except it's no secret, I don't keep secrets. 
 -Well, I think that-- [gasps] -[rumbling] 
 [menacing music playing] 
 You gotta be kidding. 
 Maybe we should get back to the Platform. 
 I think it has the same idea. 
 [suspenseful music playing] 
 Neeku, there you are. Did you find him? 
 No, I have looked everywhere. Bibo is gone. 
 His adorable trail of chaos and mayhem ends here. 
 [weeping] 
 I know you're upset, Neeku. I'm really sorry this happened. 
 Are you? 
 Because you wanted to get rid of him just like everyone else, and now he's gone. [trembling, weeping] 
 -I just don't wanna see you sad. 
 I've never seen you like this before. 
 Well, get used to it, for I shall never be happy again, as long as I exist. [weeping] 
 We'll find him, Neeku, I promise. 
 Really? But-- but surely, we have looked everywhere. 
 [comlink beeps] 
 [Yeager] Tam, just heard of a disturbance reported in Engineering. Probably nothing, but-- 
 Roger that. Thanks, Yeager. 
 See, Neeku, we really do care. 
 Yes, perhaps it is Bibo. We must hurry. 
 But Engineering is a maze down there. 
 How are we ever gonna find him? 
 With the help of friends. Follow me! 
 [groaning] 
 [ominous music playing] 
 What is that thing? 
 Something that's headed for the Platform. 
 We have to warn them. 
 [splashing] 
 [groaning] 
 Whoa! Punch it! 
 -Which way, Chl'parr? -[groans] 
 -My left? -[groans] 
 Oh, your left. Thank you, friend. 
 [groans] 
 [light orchestral music playing] 
 Neeku, look. 
 Is it... Oh, can it be... 
 -[gurgling joyfully] -Bibo, it is you. 
 Oh, my elation overflows. 
 [gurgling excitedly] 
 Never leave me again, smallest friend. 
 -Mwah! -Um, Neeku. Who are they? 
 The Shellfolk have been engineers here for many years. 
 -[groans] -I meant the kids. 
 Oh, Tamara, this is Kel and Eila. 
 They are helpers to the Shellfolk. 
 -Hi. -Hello. 
 So, uh, you just live in Engineering? 
 OK. Well, thanks for finding Bibo. 
 You've made Neeku very happy. 
 Hmm, too bad it won't last. 
 [tense music playing] 
 Why would you say that? 
 Something's coming. 
 My sister's dreamt about it for days. 
 When she has the same dream over and over, it always comes true. 
 It's coming for that. 
 And if you don't make things right, it will destroy the entire station to get to him. 
 Do you know what Bibo is? 
 A sign of things to come. 
 Something very, very big. 
 We felt it in the air. The birds have all fled. 
 Creatures of the deep have disappeared. 
 Look, I have a huge problem with vagueness, OK? 
 -Just tell me, what wants Bibo? -[groaning] 
 [both] That does. 
 Everyone, get to safety. Head to the shelters. 
 How do we get them to listen? 
 -Pirate alarm. -Good to know. 
 Citizens, are you attempting to incite panic? 
 That's exactly what we're doing. 
 Everyone needs to panic right now! 
 Confession received. 
 You will be immediately arrested and detained. 
 Oh, no. 
 [roaring] 
 -[screams] -[overlapping chatter] 
 [tense music playing] 
 Attention, everyone, the Platform is under attack. 
 Close all shield doors. Repeat, lock it down. 
 -Look out. -[gurgling] 
 Close security doors. Ace Squadron, scramble and launch. Now! 
 Use any means necessary to attack, but do not use your missiles. 
 The threat is too close to the Platform. 
 [heroic music playing] 
 [engines whirring] 
 
 
 
 [tense music playing] 
 [roaring] 
 [electricity crackling] 
 The market doors, they're jammed. 
 I've heard you're a good pilot, Kaz. 
 Now's the time to prove it. 
 -But what about the doors? -I'll handle them. 
 -Get up there. -Kaz to Yeager. 
 Prep the Fireball. 
 Close. Come on, close. 
 [roaring] 
 Ace-1 to squadron. Stay high. 
 Those tentacles are faster than they look. 
 What is that thing? 
 How should I know? 
 It's ugly and I can smell it from up here. 
 -[gurgling] -[groaning] 
 -What is happening? -Apparently it's a sign. 
 A bad one. Kel, Eila, you and the Shellfolk, get to cover. 
 Come on, Neeku, let's get up there. 
 [alarm blaring] 
 [roaring] 
 What is that thing? What's it doing? 
 [gurgling] 
 [sniffing] 
 -It's hunting. -Hu-- hunting? 
 Eila's right. I think it wants Bibo. 
 -Bibo, but why? -I don't know. 
 Maybe it wants to eat it. 
 She's prepped and ready to go. 
 Kaz, come in. 
 I know why that creature is attacking. 
 -I think Bibo is its main diet. -Well, that's a complication. 
 What do we do? 
 I'll tell you what we're not going to do, let anyone hurt Neeku's friend. Get up there. 
 [heroic music playing] 
 OK, that thing is huge. 
 [roaring] 
 Ace-1 to unauthorized ship. 
 Clear this airspace now. 
 No can do, Hype. 
 Looks like you need all the help you can get. 
 -[groans] -[gurgling, whining] 
 Neeku, we're gonna have to let Bibo go. 
 No, Bibo is not food. 
 What else can we do? 
 The whole Platform is at stake. 
 Neeku, get that thing off the Platform. 
 It will destroy us all. 
 Would you do it already? Do it! 
 No, I will not. You cannot have him. 
 [groans] 
 [Griff] Our cannons aren't doing anything to that beast. 
 [roars] 
 Doza to squadron. 
 You are clear to use missiles within the perimeter. 
 Now we're talking. You heard the man. 
 Light 'em up. 
 [missiles whirring] 
 At least we're hurting it. 
 Coming around for a closer pass. 
 [roaring] 
 [tense music playing] 
 -[buttons clacking] -[groans] 
 Steady, Griff. I got you. 
 Neeku, nothing else is working. 
 You have to do it. I'm sorry. 
 You're wrong. I know this. 
 [roars menacingly] 
 [gurgling longingly] 
 [stirring music playing] 
 Of course. It's obvious. 
 Neeku to Kaz. Stop the attack. 
 Neeku? Say again. 
 Tell the ships to stop. 
 I will give it what it wants. 
 Roger that, buddy. Fireball to Ace-1. 
 Order your ships to stand down. 
 What are you, nuts? Why would we do that? 
 We can't stop it with firepower. 
 But my friend has what that thing wants. 
 [ships whirring] 
 Weapons aren't working. Hype, we need another plan. 
 Ace-1 to squadron. Hold your fire. 
 [tense music playing] 
 [roars] 
 [menacing music playing] 
 [roars] 
 I have what you want. Come take it. 
 [roars] 
 Neeku! 
 [instrumental music playing] 
 [growls] 
 [gurgling lovingly] 
 [growls] 
 She's Bibo's mother? 
 That cute, little, disgusting thing grows into that? 
 [gurgling excitedly] 
 No, no, no, small friend. 
 You stay put. 
 [solemn music playing] 
 [gurgles] 
 I love you too. Goodbye, Bibo. 
 [roars] 
 [ship whooshes] 
 [heroic music playing] 
 Neeku, I know it's been a rough few days, but I got you a present. 
 -[squealing excitedly] -See? 
 It's a little gorg. I named him Lubo. 
 I figured he'd make you feel-- 
 -[munching] -Better. 
 [swallows] 
 Thank you, Kaz. I do feel better. 
 That was extremely considerate of you. 
 And delicious. 
 Um, what are friends for? 
 [heroic fanfare] 
 [theme music playing]
