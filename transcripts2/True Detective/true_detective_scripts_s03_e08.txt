 ROLAND WEST: A good man's dead 'cause we pushed him, knowin' we didn't like him for it, seeing how he was takin' it. 
  We did that. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS.] 
  I'm thinking about Tom. 
  Thinking about that note. 
  You see him type anything? 
  So, you don't know nothin'? 
  You just makin' your money, and milkin' they pain. 
  Looks like this man with one eye gave Julie a doll in 1980. 
  Do you know who these people are? 
  Two ghosts? 
  In 2012, two former Louisiana State Police stopped a serial killer associated with some kind of pedophile ring. 
  I think what happened to the Purcell children was connected. 
  With the cousin's help. 
  I think their parents sold them off. 
  Hoyt. 
  He got something for kids. 
  [GRUNTING.] 
  [GUNSHOT ECHOES.] 
  Now it's all gone! 
  Done! 
  Whatever he knew, gone! 
  I need to know everything. 
  - [PHONE RINGS.] 
  - WAYNE HAYS: You gotta just trust me. 
  EDWARD HOYT: [OVER PHONE.] 
  Detective Wayne Hays. 
  Edward Hoyt. 
  [MUSIC PLAYING.] 
  I got a letter this mornin' How do you reckon it read? 
  Said, "Hurry, hurry, the man you love is dead" I got a letter this mornin' How do you reckon it read? 
  It was sayin' "Hurry, hurry The man you love is dead" Well, I grabbed up my suitcase And I took off down the road When I got there he was layin' on the coolin' board Grabbed up my suitcase And I took off down the road Mmm, when I got there he was layin' Layin' on the coolin' board Mmm, mmm AMELIA: "What will become of you and me besides the photo and the memory? 
  This is the school in which we learn. 
  That time is the fire in which we burn. 
  What is the self amidst this blaze? 
  What am I now that I was then, which I shall suffer and act again? 
  The children shouting are bright as they run. 
  This is the school in which they learn. 
  What am I now that I was then? 
  May memory restore again and again the smallest color of the smallest day. 
  Time is the school in which we learn. 
  Time is the fire in which we burn. 
  " WAYNE: Tourin' backroads? 
  I've seen 'em all. 
  Wanted privacy. 
  My hope being that we could resolve this situation, just the two of us. 
  What situation is that? 
  Don't do that. 
  You got in the car. 
  You know what this is about. 
  Ahh. 
  You were army, correct? 
  Recon. 
  Saw combat? 
  Many times. 
  Mm. 
  HOYT: I was 7th Infantry. 
  Korea. 
  Chosin. 
  We took all the casualties so the Marines could turn tail. 
  Thirty below zero. 
  Lost about 5,000 men. 
  WAYNE: I wouldn't imagine a man like you meets a man like me to trade war stories. 
  We're both soldiers. 
  You understand triage. 
  My man Harris James. 
  I want to know what happened to him. 
  Somethin' happen to him? 
  Spoke a couple days ago up at your offices. 
  Don't start off by lyin' to me, Mr. 
  Hays. 
  The last time I saw him, all we did was talk. 
  What'd you talk about? 
  Julie Purcell. 
  That's the girl went missin', been in the news again recent. 
  What'd he say about her? 
  Can't talk details since it's ongoin'. 
  But you think Harris had something to do with this girl? 
  Yes, sir, I believe he did. 
  Him and some others. 
  And you got no idea where he might be? 
  Might be he took off we got him worried. 
  Cameras all around corporate. 
  Access roads to the plant, everywhere. 
  Video of Harris's car pullin' out of the gate. 
  Followed a minute later by your cruiser. 
  Just had to follow up with some questions. 
  Man's a hell of a talker. 
  I give you chance after chance to speak plainly to me, and you keep throwin' sh1t in my face. 
  You know, sir I've always respected you and your family. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  Family. 
  That's what it's We only had the one. 
  Then Ellen got sick. 
  Now our child's gone too. 
  Somethin' you want to get off your chest, sir? 
  Nobody's gonna hear it but us. 
  Mr. 
  Hoyt. 
  You wanna tell me about Julie Purcell? 
  I don't know about Julie Purcell. 
  I'm in the f*ckin' dark. 
  And, well I guess Harris didn't talk enough after all. 
  We know about the kids' uncle. 
  The phone calls from the mother, Lucy. 
  Harris goin' to Vegas, same time she OD'ed. 
  What I know? 
  Harris's work beeper, newest thing. 
  Has a little computer chip keyed to our corporate system. 
  Includes a GPS signal. 
  And I have exact coordinates where Harris last was before it went dead. 
  Now, you bein' the law, and me an interested party, should the two of us go out to those woods, see if we can't find Harris James? 
  And can you tell me, Mr. 
  Hays are we gonna need f*ckin' shovels? 
  You wanna swap confessions? 
  Just what is it you think I did? 
  That's why you bring me here. 
  So you could see how much I know. 
  Word is your investigation ended. 
  So we're done now. 
  They can do what they want with the investigation. 
  That's not gonna stop me from lookin'. 
  You heard that hotline call. 
  Sounds like she doesn't want to be found. 
  Maybe, Mr. 
  Hays, best thing you could do for that young woman is leave her in peace. 
  Hard walkin' away knowin' people mean to do her harm. 
  Well if the police ain't lookin' for her, and you're not, can't imagine anybody else'd be. 
  In fact, I can practically guarantee it. 
  Otherwise could be you're givin' these people you mention reason to find her. 
  See? 
  You don't drop it there's others can't either. 
  What happened? 
  Just tell me what happened! 
  I don't know what happened. 
  Do I look like a man with f*ckin' answers?! 
  Maybe one day I'll come see you. 
  Try havin' this talk again. 
  That you hopin' to get your balls back? 
  Or truly wantin' me to regard you as a threat? 
  Think about what that'd mean to your family you bein' a murderer and all. 
  Think about what it'd mean for that girl. 
  Mr. 
  Hays, do you want me to feel threatened? 
  - Ahh. 
  - [BOTTLE THUDS.] 
  I'll let you find your own way back. 
  LEANNE: No way Harris woulda run off. 
  He loved his family. 
  He was a wonderful father. 
  I'm sorry 'bout that. 
  ROLAND: Wonderin' if maybe you could speak toward an old associate of your husband's. 
  Was a black man with one eye. 
  You ever see your husband with someone like that? 
  Know who it might be? 
  Why are you asking? 
  ROLAND: We're trying to find a person in connection with somethin' else. 
  Description come up a few times, we can't get a name. 
  You sure you never saw a man like that? 
  [SIGHS.] 
  A man like that came by the house. 
  Few weeks after Harris disappeared. 
  I don't like to think about it. 
  I was upset at the time. 
  He had, uh, one white eye and a scar. 
  He said he knew Harris. 
  He upset me. 
  Did he want somethin'? 
  He asked did I know if Harris had found the girl. 
  I thought maybe maybe he meant Harris hadn't been faithful to me. 
  I - I ran him off. 
  - Tell you his name? 
  He introduced himself as Junius somethin'. 
  He upset me. 
  I made him leave. 
  Junius. 
  You wanna bet that's Mr. 
  June? 
  Makin' his name Junius Watts, maybe? 
  Worth a try. 
  I checked with a gal from state records about the Hoyt place. 
  Been held in trust by the estate. 
  Nobody's livin' there. 
  So? 
  The old maid the other day? 
  She talked about some area they couldn't go. 
  I wanna look at it. 
  Well I guess you're lead detective now, Lieutenant. 
  Goddamn right I am. 
  KINDT: You couldn't help yourself, could you? 
  Sir? 
  "Purcell Investigation Brought to False Conclusion. 
  Sources Say Case Far from Solved. 
  " And what sources, Detective Hays, could this headline be alluding to? 
  I-I didn't know We're lookin' at suin' your little girlfriend. 
  I haven't read the papers. 
  "An anonymous source in the investigation insists that there are a number of clues and suspicious facts of the Purcell case that are being ignored in favor of a hasty conviction of the West Finger shooter. 
  " Your man here, he's suggested you got taken advantage. 
  Like you're too pussy-struck to have known what she was doin'. 
  KINDT: We think you owe the department your own op-ed. 
  You're gonna write a statement explaining that fragments of hearsay were used without your consent, facts were misrepresented, that the woman who wrote this did so without your cooperation. 
  I'm not much of a writer. 
  KINDT: Well, we'll write it for you. 
  All you gotta do is sign. 
  - Purple! 
  Think about it - Say "thank you," Wayne. 
  Just make it right, man. 
  You got carried away. 
  Walk it back now. 
  If I don't? 
  D Company needs a new Public Information officer. 
  Administration. 
  You'll never work another Major Crimes investigation. 
  Or you could just quit. 
  [GRUNTS.] 
  You are one lucky mother. 
  You know how hard I had to work, get them to give you another shot? 
  - Appreciate it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hey, uh, listen to me. 
  - [CANE CLATTERING ON GROUND.] 
  You don't ever do any kind of sh1t like this to me again. 
  I can't figure what you were thinking. 
  ROLAND: Hey. 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  You heard 'em. 
  I'm done. 
  What? 
  I get them to give you a pass, and y-you're quittin'? 
  - Oh, I'm not quittin'. 
  - You can't. 
  This is pride, Wayne, and it's f*ckin' you up. 
  Take a breath, count to ten, and sign their goddamn paper. 
  - No. 
  - Public Information? 
  You hate the public. 
  You're a detective. 
  You don't do sh1t like this. 
  Anything anybody mighta said about you - What'd they say about me? 
  - That you're a professional. 
  I mean they used to say that. 
  Got away from me, man. 
  I was pissed off. 
  Didn't really think it through. 
  It's not like me, you're right. 
  OK. 
  All right, there we go. 
  I mean, you just sign their statement, and let's you and me move on. 
  Except then I'd be burnin' her. 
  Callin' her a liar. 
  She didn't really do nothin' wrong. 
  She didn't lie, and I'm not sayin' she did. 
  So what? 
  This is your job. 
  Our job. 
  You're my partner. 
  That's it? 
  You're just gonna go be a typist? 
  Probably a lot less bullshit. 
  Couple years, maybe it all blows over. 
  I can outlast 'em. 
  What about us? 
  What you talkin' 'bout? 
  Grab a beer, go to a game. 
  Not like we're not gonna see each other, man. 
  [PHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS CLACKING.] 
  [CHATTER.] 
  [METAL CLANKING.] 
  [DROPS CHAIN ON GROUND.] 
  [HINGES CREAK.] 
  [INSECTS CHIRRING.] 
  [GRUNTS.] 
  Suppose somebody catches us? 
  We're old and confused. 
  [HINGES CREAK.] 
  [GRUNTS.] 
  [HINGES CREAK.] 
  This is where they kept her. 
  This is where she ran away from. 
  Twenty-five years. 
  And we just [SIGHS.] 
  All this All this goddamn time. 
  What the hell have I What the hell were you doin'? 
  Thought it was the right thing. 
  I had a family. 
  Now, that must be nice. 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.] 
  I find you burnin' your clothes in the middle of the night. 
  This morning you disappear after a phone call. 
  If you've got somebody else, I can take it, just say so. 
  No. 
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
  It's the case. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  It was only ever the case. 
  And it's over now. 
  What part of the case made you burn your suit at 3:00 in the morning? 
  The bad part. 
  Can I get you a a drink? 
  I'd prefer a straight answer. 
  I know what you'd prefer. 
  But supposin' that answer would be dangerous to you? 
  I'll take a hard truth over a nice lie any day. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  We never really established this, 'cause when we met I told you too much. 
  And then for a long time, I wasn't really a cop. 
  But there are aspects of my job things I've seen, things I know it's not for sharin'. 
  And this wouldn't do anything but cause harm. 
  Maybe it's not for you to decide what's harmful or not for me. 
  Except I already did. 
  It's something we should decide together. 
  No, we shouldn't. 
  And that is my whole point. 
  I might have a problem with that, because this morning you said you'd tell me everything. 
  That was a mistake. 
  And I just realized now that I want your approval, and sometimes I do the wrong thing because it's what you want. 
  I'd like to stop that goin' forward. 
  Are we going forward? 
  How do we with this big secret between us? 
  Maybe that's what we're really talkin' about. 
  There's always been this big secret between us. 
  And it's that you and me who we are together, this marriage, our children it's all tied up in a dead boy and a missin' girl. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  I'll take that drink now. 
  [BAR CHATTER.] 
  [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX.] 
  Bud and a shot of Jack. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.] 
  - You got a problem, little man? 
  - No. 
  No. 
  No, sir. 
  No problem here. 
  Then put your f*ckin' eyes somewhere else. 
  What it is I'm just a fan of romance. 
  May I ask you a question? 
  She look like that before you rode her cross country? 
  What the f*ck did you say, you little midget? 
  See, I always wondered, all this butt-faced human pieces of garbage out there walkin' the earth who's makin' 'em? 
  I mean, what kind of Frankenstein monsters are out there copulatin' to create all these hunks-of-shit people in the world? 
  Then I come in this bar, here's you two, givin' me the answer I've been lookin' for my whole f*ckin' life. 
  [LAUGHS.] 
  - [ROLAND GROANS.] 
  - [CROWD EXCLAIMS.] 
  Unhh! 
  Unh. 
  [SPITS.] 
  You done buckin', cowboy? 
  Thank God it was you hit me instead of that woolly mammoth you're f*ckin'. 
  [GRUNTING.] 
  [GROANS.] 
  [GROANS.] 
  [SHOUTING, GRUNTING.] 
  Last night, listening just now I've wondered: maybe we don't really know each other. 
  Because you're right, what you said about us and the Purcell kids. 
  We never really talked about it in that way. 
  What it meant for us. 
  But it's ten years later. 
  You write a story, you get past the start it's important to know how you want it to end. 
  You were pregnant yesterday. 
  And now Henry's nine and I blink, he'll be out the house. 
  If we get there, I don't wanna wonder how it all happened. 
  I don't think one date night a month is gonna get us where we need to be. 
  I'm writing this sequel, you're on Major Crimes They tanked the case again. 
  Same as '80. 
  I oughta quit. 
  I've thought you should quit for ten years. 
  - Why? 
  - "Why?" Why wouldn't I want you to quit? 
  I don't think you realize this, Wayne, you could have been good at just about anything. 
  But what you think you are, it made you stuck. 
  I never went to college. 
  Or California. 
  I listened to my Ma. 
  I was in the army, and then PD. 
  Maybe I got too good at doin' what I was told. 
  I always think about why you said you joined the army. 
  Didn't have money for school, or no job No, you told me [SIGHS.] 
  you said you figured that if you died that your mom would be rich, because the government would give her $10,000, and that's why you ended up joining. 
  Uh I think we both we want somethin', we get real single-minded. 
  This new thing that's not why you write. 
  It's all the work I've done, I don't want to see it wasted But it's not you. 
  You wanna write your real book, write it. 
  It'll be great. 
  I probably won't read it, but it'll be beautiful. 
  [SNIFFLING.] 
  And I think that I think maybe I should quit. 
  You should too. 
  I walk away, you walk away. 
  And let's put this thing down. 
  It's not ours. 
  And like you said, we're past the beginning. 
  You could really quit? 
  We'll both, together. 
  You go and write the books you want to write, and I'm gonna I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
  But the smartest person I know told me I'd be good at almost anything. 
  [KISS.] 
  Get outta here. 
  [CRYING.] 
  - We're - [DOG WHINES.] 
  [DOG WHIMPERING.] 
  [DOG WHINING.] 
  Come here, buddy. 
  [LAUGHS SOFTLY.] 
  Ahh ROLAND: Old gal I knew still works at the DMV helped us out with an address. 
  Junius Watts. 
  - [CHICKENS CLUCKING.] 
  - [WATTS CALLING CHICKENS.] 
  Might be less crazy than I thought. 
  Don't get carried away. 
  WATTS: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch! 
  [CHICKENS CLUCKING.] 
  [SIGHS.] 
  I been waitin' on you all. 
  Since the night you saw my car. 
  Probably shouldn't'a drove off, but you had that baseball bat. 
  Y'all here to kill me? 
  Walk back in the house. 
  This is you. 
  Usually if PD or state want a statement, they'll just drop it by. 
  If we get an information request, then we'll just connect it to you. 
  You all set, hon? 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  Thank you. 
  [TYPEWRITERS CLACKING.] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.] 
  [TYPEWRITERS INCREASE IN VOLUME.] 
  WATTS: I worked with Mr. 
  Hoyt on his first chicken farm. 
  Been there since he started. 
  Lost the eye in a line accident, one of the hooks. 
  That ain't the part of your history we're interested in. 
  I was sayin'. 
  After he expands, he moves me to his place, I started managin' his household for him. 
  Him and Miss Ellen, they had Isabel. 
  Miss Ellen got sick. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  I helped him raise his daughter. 
  Isabel. 
  She was a delight. 
  She go to university and meets a young man, and they have a little baby girl. 
  Mary. 
  They was happy. 
  Mr. 
  Hoyt, he happy. 
  Then there was the the accident. 
  Her husband and her daughter skidded off a mountain on their way to meet her at Bull Shoals. 
  She gets very, very sad. 
  Worse than sad. 
  Won't talk, won't leave the house. 
  Has to take medicine. 
  Lithium. 
  This little girl I helped raise was so sad she can't talk. 
  Mr. 
  Hoyt, he can't stand seein' her this way. 
  So he starts travelin' again. 
  Then one night she snuck off from me. 
  Took her car and smashed it all up. 
  This patrolman, Harris James, he help us keep it quiet. 
  Then for the first time in almost three years, somethin' stirs her. 
  Employee picnic, '79. 
  She sees this family there with this little girl, - and she runs out and tries to grab her. 
  - Mary! 
  Hmph. 
  Miss Isabel, she keep talkin' about that girl she saw. 
  Sayin' she's just like Mary. 
  Says she wanna see her again. 
  So I take the mother Lucy aside, back when she worked on the line, and I talked to her about maybe lettin' Miss Isabel play with her daughter a bit. 
  She was good with that? 
  Well, she say OK, but she want money. 
  And she wanted the little girl's brother along, keep an eye on her. 
  And that was OK. 
  Well, for a little while we meet 'em, a little spot in the woods, and we just played. 
  And Miss Isabel, she get back to bein' her old self. 
  Except what? 
  Well, we had an idea. 
  Miss Isabel want to adopt the girl. 
  She have a better life, we thought, and well, the father, we'd just have to figure somethin' out. 
  But eh Miss Isabel, she she confused. 
  She'd stopped takin' her medicine, I-I didn't know. 
  She'd been callin' the girl "Mary" since we arrive. 
  I heard it. 
  I oughta knowed somethin' was too wrong. 
  Well, we's playin' hide-and-seek, - and Will was off lookin' for us. 
  - Will! 
  Julie! 
  I guess Miss Isabel had other plans. 
  We have to go home. 
  No. 
  Mary [JULIE SCREAMS.] 
  I told the girl her brother OK. 
  He just bump his head, that's all, and he'd wake up soon. 
  But she said we can't leave him there. 
  And she can't calm down. 
  So I brought him up to the cave. 
  It was just just a bad accident. 
  Mr. 
  Hoyt, he don't know none of this, 'cause he on safari. 
  So I call the man Harris James, he help us out before. 
  When that Woodard man went crazy, Harris brought that boy's backpack up to his place, and the girl's shirt. 
  What about the mother Lucy? 
  WATTS: Harris talked to her. 
  Explained things, the accident. 
  Offered her a lot of money. 
  Showed her the best thing was for her to take it and let Miss Isabel have Julie, just like we talked about. 
  Only, it just happened this way The little one, Julie. 
  Time we get home, she calm with everything, no trouble. 
  She happy to be there. 
  We seen the girl is happy. 
  She is. 
  - ISABEL: How's the castle? 
  - And for a time it was workin'. 
  - Couple years. 
  - JULIE: Good. 
  The little one, she thinks she's Isabel's daughter, 'cause Isabel's been tellin' her stories. 
  I'm just tryin' to take care of 'em best I can. 
  I swear, the little one was happy. 
  I thought she was happy. 
  I didn't realize till later what'd been goin' on. 
  WAYNE: She'd been feedin' that little girl lithium since she was ten. 
  That was why the girl didn't have no problems once we left Devil's Den. 
  Musta started then. 
  That's why she wasn't sure about her own history. 
  She'd been drugged half her life, told some fucked-up fairy tale by this woman. 
  And Miss Isabel was gettin' sicker and sicker. 
  The girl is gettin' more and more confused. 
  Then she growed up. 
  She wants to leave. 
  She asks questions memories, her brother. 
  I want to help her. 
  WAYNE: You helped her run away. 
  Yeah. 
  I make sure that the door is unlocked and Miss Isabel was in her bath. 
  And I gave her a map how to get to a place I had nearby. 
  [PANTING.] 
  But she never showed. 
  And I was lookin' for her ever since. 
  Tryin' to save what I could. 
  That's real heroic of ya you cyclops m*therf*cker. 
  What happened to Isabel? 
  After the girl run off she had another break. 
  She put on her weddin' dress she took all her pills she go to sleep and never wakes up. 
  Did ya ever find her? 
  'Ninety-seven. 
  I'd been passin' Julie's picture around for ten years. 
  This runaway girl tells me about this shelter nuns in Fort Smith run. 
  The girl says she saw Julie workin' there at the convent, and they say her name is Mary, which I knew it must be her. 
  Mary July. 
  "Like summertime," she said. 
  She didn't have any ID. 
  She stayed for three and a half years. 
  First getting help, then helping others. 
  She'd been in bad shape when she arrived. 
  She had what's known as disassociation issues. 
  I believe she found a home here. 
  But her time outside, things she'd done She had HIV, it turned out. 
  SISTER SHELLY: We took care of her in the infirmary when she got sick. 
  A few months, she was gone. 
  I was too late. 
  [CHOKED UP.] 
  Something she'd done out there on her own got her real sick. 
  [SNIFFLES.] 
  And I told her I told her that I would meet her. 
  I drew her a map. 
  But she wasn't there. 
  It's always too late whatever we do. 
  That's why I's sittin' outside your house. 
  I was just tryin' to get up the nerve. 
  Tryin' to tell you what happened. 
  So you can kill me or take me in. 
  I want it. 
  I don't wanna live with this no more. 
  Take me in. 
  We don't have the authority. 
  [WHIMPERS.] 
  You don't wanna live with it f*ckin' don't. 
  Hey!

  Your name was Julie Purcell. 
  I'm sorry I didn't do a better job for ya. 
  I'm real, real sorry for that, miss. 
  Failure was mine. 
  You deserved better than this. 
  Better than me. 
 
 
 
  [BIRDS SINGING.] 
  Oh! 
  - Sorry, mister. 
  - MAN: There you are. 
  All right, that's enough runnin' around, Lucy. 
  Why don't you go ahead and jump in the truck. 
  OK. 
  I'm sorry 'bout that. 
  She likes to run around. 
  No problem. 
  You been takin' care of the place long?

  And I kept doin' the same. 
  That's nice of you. 
  Y'all have a good day. 
  Thank you, sir.

  But it's all hers. 
  Maybe we'll write a book about it.

  [LAUGHS.] 
  We got an ending, I guess. 
  But I don't, uh Hmm. 
  Do you feel like any kinda closure? 
  I don't. 
  Me neither. 
  Talkin' to your boy. 
  I's been wantin' to get closer to town, and we were thinkin', uh How'd you feel, me crashin' here with you a few nights a week? 
  I guess so. 
  I keep a neat house, though. 
  I'm just sayin'.

  [KNOCKING ON DOOR.] 
  Hi. 
  Hey. 
  Tell me what we're doing. 
  You're not talkin' to me, don't return my calls. 
  We're playing games now? 
  I don't play. 
  Is this about what I wrote? 
  You read it. 
  You encouraged me. 
  What's going on with you? 
  What happened? 
  Wait right here a minute. 
  [GRUNTS.] 
  That's all your stuff. 
  That's how you say "I don't think we should see each other anymore"? 
  What the hell is wrong with you? 
  You don't like how I am, get out of my house. 
  All right, give it to me then. 
  I want a clear picture of who I've been spending time with. 
  Clear picture is, I don't wanna see you anymore. 
  And I'm not the asshole here. 
  You're the asshole. 
  Me? 
  - How? 
  - You used me. 
  f*ckin' around with me so you could hear what the police are doin'. 
  Like you're better than me. 
  Right? 
  When I landed back in the States, some high yellow bitch like you called me a baby killer. 
  I'm sorry that happened sh1t, you're whiter than my partner. 
  Former partner. 
  What's the matter with you? 
  What happened? 
  I'm f*cked's what happened! 
  Twelve years on the job, and I'm a f*ckin' secretary now. 
  So you got in trouble. 
  What did they Is that why you're doing this? 
  I'm tryin' to pull my head out my ass, regards to you. 
  You I don't know. 
  Maybe you didn't mean it all the way, maybe it just happened, but you was workin' me. 
  Always askin' questions, always talkin' about the case. 
  That's not what I did. 
  You know that's not what I did. 
  No, I don't! 
  But I just about decided that you don't know what you're really up to most of the time, do you? 
  Bein' a good-lookin' woman like you are, I mean. 
  People don't really expect you to take responsibility. 
  You're just like a pretty bird, flyin' around, shittin' on people's heads. 
  I don't need one of them. 
  I was doin' real good without no head-shittin' birds in here. 
  You're a mean drunk. 
  But it's good to see how weak you really are. 
  You've got a badge and a gun, couple of other things that you learned from watching movies. 
  But there's nothing here. 
  [GRUNTS.] 
  They wanted me to burn you down. 
  Sign a statement sayin' you were lyin'. 
  That you took pieces of what you heard and made up all that sh1t you wrote. 
  You should. 
  I don't want you in trouble. 
  I don't want anything from you, ever. 
  Go ahead, sign their statement. 
  I'm gonna be fine. 
  I don't need the rest. 
  I don't want this sh1t in my house! 
  [GRUNTS.] 
  AMELIA'S VOICE: "Among the children who knew her, a ten-year-old named Mike Ardoin seemed to take Julie's disappearance hardest. 
  I knew Mike to be a shy, artistic boy, and he often played with Julie, or at least sought out her company. 
  His father ran a small lawn servicing business, and when he spoke about Julie, the boy's lip trembled and his eyes flooded. 
  My attempts at comfort were completely insufficient, but I tried to let him talk about his feelings. 
  He started crying. 
  He said he always thought he'd marry Julie when he grew up. 
  " AMELIA: "Tell me a story. 
  Make it a story of great distances, and starlight. 
  " No. 
  Please. 
  Please. 
  What if the ending isn't really the ending at all? 
  What if Julie did find a life at that convent? 
  Friendship, love. 
  And what if that little boy who loved her so much, that little boy whose daddy, and later himself, took care of the yard at that convent? 
  [WOMAN SPEAKING IN DISTANCE.] 
  AMELIA: What if he recognized her? 
  "'If you knew time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, you wouldn't talk about wasting it. 
  '" AMELIA: What if he knew her even if she didn't know herself? 
  [LAUGHS SHYLY.] 
  And what if those nuns who cared about her, those women who knew she'd had a hard life they knew bad people were looking for her? 
  What if they wanted to protect her? 
  Protect her how? 
  The only way they could by telling a story. 
  And And then Oh! 
  Sorry, Mister. 
  The little girl that was her. 
  Oh my God. 
  What if there's another story? 
  What if something went unbroken? 
  All this life, all this loss, what if it was really one long story that just kept going and going until it healed itself? 
  Wouldn't that be a story worth telling? 
  Wouldn't that be a story worth hearing? 
  [PHONE BEEPING.] 
  [LINE OUT RINGING.] 
  MAN: Information.

  I don't let people talk to me the way you did. 
  A few women, no men at all. 
  - OK. 
  - I want you to understand that. 
  You don't strike me as tolerant of that sort of behavior. 
  No. 
  That was the point, wasn't it? 
  But I'm trying to remember that a few weeks ago your friend was shot and you almost died. 
  You want a do-over? 
  I guess I want to know if you meant it. 
  If you meant what you said. 
  I want to know if you want us to stop.
