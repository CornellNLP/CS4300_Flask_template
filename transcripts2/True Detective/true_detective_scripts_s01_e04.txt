 What is it you think happened? 
 Someone killed this girl, made a big show of it... left a painting of the crime scene on one of your old churches. 
 You're obsessive. 
 You're obsessive, too, just not about the job. 
 Are you gonna go home with this guy? 
 Really none of your business. 
 Stop! 
 You know if it's true? 
 I didn't hear anything. 
 What have you been doing, Marty? 
 I found another girl. 
 She was positive for meth and LSD. 
 You ever think maybe he tried to push things where he wanted them to go? 
 Hey, we caught a break in the case, boss. 
 I thought you were handing that off. 
 She had a boyfriend you know about? 
 Reggie. 
 Reggie Ledoux. 
 Reggie Ledoux skipped parole 8 months ago. 
 He's busted in connection to a narcotics lab used to make meth and LSD, did two years at Avoyelles, and guess who his cellmate was the last 4 months. 
 Charlie Lange. 
 What Dori do? 
 Dori's dead. 
 I need an all-state APB on one Reginald Ledoux.

 "Who Goes There" 
 [Door opens] 
 CHARLIE: What you doing? 
 HART: You f*cked with us, Charlie. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 I did not, sir. 
 Reggie Ledoux. 
 Hey, I don't even want to know that freak, man. 
 Y'all ain't asked nothin' about Reggie. 
 f*ck, man, my... my wife just died... 
 Ex-wife! 
 You had Reggie Ledoux take her out, didn't you? 
 No. 
 Hmm? 
 What are you talking about, man? 
 Hmm? 
 Reggie? Put her out there with them antlers on? I... 
 You have Reggie do it? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Hmm? 
 Reggie Ledoux did this? 
 Reggie Ledoux? 
 Reggie m*therf*ckin' 
 Ledoux did this?! 
 f*ck, man! sh1t! 
 Let me out, man! 
 Let me out! 
 f*ck, man! 
 Hey, Charlie? 
 We're not gonna give you the Oscar no matter how hard you try. 
 Oh, f*ck you, man. 
 You don't know me. 
 You don't know what I been through. 
 And what are you talking about? You talk to me! 
 Ledoux knew about her, right? 
 You talk about her to him? 
 Yeah, man... yeah, the way you do sharing a house. 
 Yeah, you talk pussy, talk scores. 
 That's what you do. 
 Showed him pictures of her, hmm? 
 Yeah, I guess so, yeah. 
 I had some she give me when I first went down, stuff for me to look at. 
 You know, like Polaroids. 
 He was a big guy... a lot bigger than you. 
 Do you tell me you didn't get along? 
 Nah, I mean, I did, most part. 
 You've got to, you're sharing a house, like I'm saying. 
 I mean, he gets you high, man, but he's creep. 
 I ain't want to know him. 
 Tell me about Ledoux. 
 How is he creep? 
 He's a cook, you know, like a chemist? 
 He used to, uh, make sh1t out of kitchen stuff... cook down cleansers and whatnot. 
 Used tater skins and fry grease to make high-test sour mash. 
 He got mad knowledge for that sh1t, but, like, I don't know, man, he talk like a short-eyes, like something. 
 How you mean? He wouldn't talk that sh1t up in here. 
 No, man, he didn't. Like, me and him at night, blasted up on one of his mixes. 
 I mean, he could brew some sh1t up put you up out your head, man. 
 That's a big deal in here. 
 I mean, f*ck, man, it's a big deal out there, too. 
 So, uh, what kind of sh1t was he talking? 
 He said that there's this place down south where all these rich men go to, uh, devil-worship. 
 He said that, uh... they... they sacrifice kids and whatnot. 
 Women and children all got... all got murdered there, and, um, something about someplace called Carcosa and the Yellow King. 
 He said there's all these, like, old stones out in the woods, people go to, like, worship. 
 He said, uh... 
 He said there's just so much good killin' down there. 
 Reggie got this brand on his back, like in a spiral? 
 He says that's their sign. 
 What the f*ck ever, you understand? 
 I don't listen to the man, but he's big, so I don't tell him to shut the f*ck up, neither! 
 You remember any buddies he ever talked about? 
 So we checked the records here, and he hadn't ever had any visitors. 
 We both know Tyro Weems. 
 Tyrone like to tell you where he's at. 
 Look, man, Reggie's crazy, like, for real. 
 Had to be tough, living with somebody spouting insane sh1t in your ear all day long. 
 You gonna give me something for what I told you just now? 
 Parole board nod. 
 Fair's fair. 
 Hey. Hey! 
 You think 'cause I talked to him about Dori that... 
 I might have got her killed? 
 You probably had something to do with it. 
 I don't think you should have shown him those pictures. 
 Do you? 
 [Door clangs] 
 COHLE: We need to find this Tyrone Weems, see what he knows about Ledoux. 
 HART: Yeah. 
 Ahem. 
 You didn't have to tell him it was his fault. 
 Guy was already low. 
 Yeah, he asked about his end first. 
 Parole board. 
 So? 
 So f*ck him.

 You're funny, Marty... the sh1t you get soft about. 
 HART VOICE-OVER: I wanted every member of that family that I could find. 
 Turns out... there weren't any. 
 You know how weird that is in Louisiana? 
 A cousin, what was it, Dewall, was not on paper except for a, uh, trucker's license. 
 Ledoux had turned into a ghost from the time he skipped parole check. 
 Tell me, young studs, what would you do when you hit a wall like that? 
 Responding to the complaint, I approached the house. 
 Seeing that the screen door was broken and the inner door... ajar, I... I felt that entrance complied with standard procedure. 
 Upon entering the domicile, I noticed what appeared to be marijuana and a white powder on the coffee table. 
 Hey, Martin. 
 We don't have to talk, Lisa. 
 The hell we don't. 
 You don't get to do what you did to me last week. 
 Look, I'm sorry. I was hurt and real drunk. 
 Talk to me now. 
 Okay. Ah, I wish you a great life and good luck with your new friend. 
 You philandering f*cking asshole. 
 Hey, look. 
 There is no pageant to perform, okay, and your disappointment is irrelevant. 
 You don't get to act like that, Marty, or like this. 
 The fact is it's nice to know you got him, and I don't want to have this conversation with you. 
 You need to respect me, Marty. 
 This is respect. 
 Rust figured a connection with an earlier death, suspicious... 
 Rianne Olivier. 
 Led us to the DB's old boyfriend, Reginald Ledoux, 35. 
 Statch rape charge against a 12-year-old, acquitted for lack of testimony. 
 Did a bit for manufacturing meth and LSD, which fits the tox screen for Lange. 
 COHLE: His old cellmate was Lange's ex-husband. 
 He showed him some cheesecake pictures of her. 
 Uh, from what we know about him, the way he talked, he sounds like he's real good for it. 
 No line on any of his people. 
 Swamp folk, dug in off the grid.

 HART: Are you Theresa Weems, Tyrone Weems' mom? 
 Tyrone ain't been around in a while. 
 You know, a few months. 
 We got in a fight 'cause he sold my microwave. 
 And what about his friends? 
 You know where they hang out? 
 I don't know, he dated this girl Kelsey for a little while. 
 HART: Kelsey, when's the last time you saw Tyrone? 
 Months. 
 We've been broke up. 
 I don't ever hear from him. 
 I don't want to. 
 I heard he got Shawnda Miller pregnant. 
 So do you have his address, phone number? 
 Look. I really wish I could help you, but I can't.

 6 months for a grand jury inquiry? 
 Why are you making me say this sh1t, man? 
 Do you know her old man? 
 Yeah, he came around, collecting from her. 
 Boss kicked him out for trying to sell christie, the girls. 
 That was about a month ago.

 I get found, I take a bullet to the head. 
 This cartel I worked on the border, they, uh, they had this routine. 
 They'd duct-tape you to a chair that was bolted to the floor, use a couple rolls, make sure you couldn't budge a f*ckin' inch. 
 And they'd cut around your face, grip your scalp, yank down, rip your face off. 
 Hmm. 
 And they'd put a mirror in front of you so you could get a good look at yourself.

 Now, now, that's tricky sh1t, bro, and I don't know you like I used to. 
 Yeah, I don't know you like I used to, either. 
 That's why the f*ck I'm here. 
 Well, let me tell you why I came, Crash. 
 I need something from you, tonight. 
 I had a 4-man team for a big grab, lost one to smokies. 
 I came looking to replace him, if you're still a bad-ass. 
 I don't do A&R, man, no f*ckin' bank jobs. 
 It ain't nothin' like that. 
 I need a good soldier. 
 Now, you do this with us, we talk about puttin' you with my man. 
 Look. 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't ride cowboy no more, Ginger. 
 Oh. 
 I don't do this small-time sh1t like this thing you're talking about, all right? 
 [Grunts] 
 What, you get neutered down south, huh? 
 I embrace the outlaw life. 
 Now, you dress the part still. 
 That just an act? 
 When in Rome, brother, but I do clean up real f*ckin' pretty. 
 [Chuckles] 
 m*therf*cker, I need a gunslinger. 
 Now, you ain't too timid, get on this sh1t with me. 
 Then we can talk about doin' business. 
 Where? 
 My place. 
 Down the bayou. 
 All right. 
 I got my truck. 
 GINGER: It'll be safe here.
