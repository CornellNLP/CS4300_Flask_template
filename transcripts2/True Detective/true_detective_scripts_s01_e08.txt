 We left something undone. 
 We gotta fix it. 
 You and I were on the case in Erath. 
 A girl comes forward and says she was chased through the woods by a spaghetti monster with green ears and I think that this is our man with the scars on his face. 
 What happened to Billy Lee Tuttle? 
 I staked his places out for weeks. 
 Found those in the safe there. 
 There was a videotape. 
 No! 
 Out of all these kids running around, you remember one that maybe had scars all across the bottom of his face? 
 I think that was Mr. Sam's grandchild. 
 Could you have a look at something for me? One thing. 
 You know Carcosa? 
 Did some backtracking on the Marie Fontenot stuff. 
 Sheriff didn't take the original complaint, deputy did. 
 Steve Geraci. 
 I said all I remember about the girl, and don't ask again. 
 I ain't gonna ask you. 
 He is.

 [Birds chirping] 
 MAN: Them flies are gettin' thick. 
 Somebody ought to give you a good hosin'. 
 Hmm. Heat ain't helpin'. 
 Eh, reckon you'll keep another day. 
 Be good, I'll bring you some more water round noon. 
 Bye, Daddy. 
 [Whistling a tune] 
 [Dog barking] 
 Hey! 
 Come on. Come on. 
 [Barks] 
 Come on. 
 CARY GRANT ON TV: What the devil is all this about? 
 Why was I brought here? 
 JAMES MASON ON TV: Games, must we? 
 Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets for the theater this evening, to a show I was looking forward to, and I get, well, kind of unreasonable about things like that. 
 With such expert play-acting, you make this very room a theater... 
 WOMAN: You have a good walk? 
 [British accent] 
 Yes, my dear. 
 Top-notch walk this morning. 
 Top-notch constitutional. 
 [Grunts, sighs] 
 It's been weeks since I left my mark. 
 Would that they had eyes to see. 
 Hey! Don't you get Miss Billie in here with them dirty feet! 
 [Dog yelping] 
 [Dog panting] 
 Sorry, old chap. 
 [Dog whining] 
 You want to make flowers today? 
 Now, Betty, I have very important work to do. 
 My... ascension removes me from the disc and the loop. 
 I'm near final stage. 
 Some mornings, I can see the infernal plane. 
 You haven't made flowers on me for maybe 3 weeks. 
 Makes me sad is all. 
 [Irish accent] Ah, come up in me lap, lass. 
 Here, and let me comfort ye in your distress. 
 [Giggles] You're make fun of me again. 
 Heh heh! Now, why'd I do a thing like that, huh? 
 Is it because you're ne so bright? 
 Because of your head bein' so slow and like? Ha ha ha! 
 Oh, you better let me go 
 'cause I'm burn your eggs. 
 Hmm? 
 Mmm. 
 [Pants] 
 [Normal voice] Couldn't you tell me about Grampa? 
 Mmm. 
 Ah! 
 Mmm. 
 I was in the cane fields, and he caught me when I was alone. 
 And the dirt was warm. 
 I felt the dirt warm on my back.

 ♪ 
 COHLE: You're gonna lose a kneecap if I got to ask you again. 
 Take it out of the bag and put it in the machine. 
 COHLE: Don't look at me. 
 Look at the TV. 
 GERACI: Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 Why are you showing me this?! 
 [Geraci screams] 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 That little girl is the one you said went to see her daddy. 
 Marie Fontenot, circa 1990. 
 I took a m-missing juvenile report. 
 [Gulps] 
 And when I went back to follow up on it, the file said, "Report made in error." 
 I never wrote that. 
 So I marched it right in to the sheriff, Ted Childress. 
 He's dead now. 
 He did it. 
 What'd the sheriff say? 
 He said he'd changed it, that he knew the mother and the father, the aunt and the uncle. 
 It was a niece once removed from him or somethin'. 
 It was the chain of command. 
 No reason to change it. 
 I just... follow what the big man says. 
 It's... how this all works. 
 I... I tried to get back with the mother. 
 I tried to get back with her. 
 She was gone! She split! 
 The file was gone! 
 Nobody said a word! 
 Later that year, I was in State CID, on Ted's recommendation! 
 Nobody ever gave me a reason to second-guess it! 
 It's chain of command! 
 Right? 
 What do you think? 
 I don't think he's lying... as far as he knows. 
 As far as I know? 
 What the f*ck is with you, man?! 
 Might be a whole lot safer if we staged something, Marty... sent the Maserati over the guardrail. 
 [Whistling same tune] 
 [School bell ringing] 
 [Children clamoring] 
 Whoa! 
 Boys, slow down. 
 WOMAN: Be careful out there. 
 I can get you a cafeteria lunch if you're hungry. 
 That's all right, Miss. 
 I've got to get on with my work. 
 Lots to do today. 
 Oh, all right. 
 [Resumes whistling] 
 [Stops whistling] 
 COHLE: We're gonna hang onto your phone and your gun till we get safe and mail them to you once we know we are. 
 That work for you, Steve? 
 You can bet your ass it doesn't. 
 And it's Sheriff Geraci to you, shitheel. 
 Now, look, Steve, you're gonna want to swing some dick on this thing. 
 I'm gonna give you a couple reasons why you won't. 
 First off, we found this tape in your possession. 
 It's a video of the little girl that you said was not missing. 
 Second off, all findings are with lawyers, ready to be forwarded to media outlets, feds, CID, US Attorneys, should either one of us get sworn a warrant or if either one of us just fall off the face of the f*ckin' earth, as people are wont to do in your neck of the woods. 
 So you just think about that little girl, Steve. 
 What about your boat? 
 That ain't my boat. 
 You know whose boat that is? 
 I never seen it before. 
 It's gonna come back on you, you assholes, one way or another. 
 You just think about that little girl, Steve. 
 For quite some time, I'm gonna be thinking about you, Rust. 
 Hey, one other thing, Steve. 
 Got an old sniper pal, all right? 
 Contract's already been paid. 
 Me or Marty, we see cuffs or coffins, you're gonna end up in the dirt. 
 Then we're gonna smear your name. 
 I got something coming for you, baby. 
 Your psycho bit don't cur me, boy! 
 You hear me?! 
 [Gunfire] 
 GERACI: What the f*ck?! Hey! 
 [Gunfire stops] 
 I strike you as more of a talker or a doer, Steve? 
 That's my f*ckin' car! 
 God damn it! 
 L'chaim, fatass. 
 You M*therf*ckers! 
 GERACI: f*ck you! 
 ♪ 
 COHLE: This old Sheriff Childress. 
 He's got no kids, no location on any of his relatives. 
 You think they could have wiped out birth records? 
 HART: I don't see why not. 
 I mean, half those hospitals along the coast are gone now. 
 HART: You know, we got a dead end on the relations and, uh, what else is there? 
 Case files. 
 You want pre-'98 or after? 
 After. 
 We're gonna have to be looking at these records with fresh eyes, Marty. 
 All right? 
 Like we're totally green. 
 Why green ears? 
 I mean, assuming that's our guy. 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't know, exactly. 
 My thinking was it was probably leaves of some kind, you know, 'cause we do know that he came at her through the woods. 
 Why? 
 What you thinking? 
 Looking for '95 Dora Lange canvassing photos from Erath. 
 Why? 
 Well... 
 Rust. 
 Come over here. 
 Now, you think, back then, does that... does that look like a fresh... paint job to you? 
 The green ears. 
 Yeah. 
 HART: Maybe they were sticking out of his hat. 
 Maybe he painted that house. 
 I'm going to look up old addressees. 
 [Hart taps table] 
 f*ck you, man. 
 ♪ 
 Something's been bugging me the last 10 years. 
 Not every day, just now and then. 
 We went at it, day you quit. 
 Were you holding back? 
 No, I don't see how I could've. 
 Oh, yeah, you do. 
 You... you've always had such an inflated idea of yourself. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning it seems pretty damn arrogant to hold back in a fight with me. 
 You think you could have put me down? 
 Ah, I don't know. 
 Hell, I'd have had to kill you. 
 You were so goddamn mad. 
 Yeah, um... ahem. 
 You know, when she told me, she said not to blame you, that it wasn't your choice. 
 You, uh, were drunk and... she made it happen. 
 Everybody's got a choice, Marty. 
 sh1t, I sure blamed you. 
 Blamed me? For what? 
 [Swallows] 
 For pushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me, use our partnership to get rid of you. 
 For just being a lying sack of sh1t. 
 You know, she couldn't have used you, you didn't want some. 
 There you go. 
 Everybody's got a choice. 
 And yet, she still cares about you. 
 You went to see her, I take it. 
 She came out to the bar. 
 What? 
 When? 
 Yeah, she was just checking on you, wanted to make sure I wasn't getting you in any trouble. 
 You should have f*ckin' told me. 
 Yeah, maybe. I guess. 
 I reckoned it was best to just avoid her name. 
 Didn't want to invite judgments. 
 You never liked being judged. 
 No, you're right, I don't. Not by you. 
 Well, I didn't say a word. 
 Well, I could read it all over your face. 
 Well, then the problem's with your face, not mine. 
 [Sighs] 
 It's hard to find something in a man who rejects people as much as you do, you know that? 
 I never told you how to live your life, Marty. 
 No, no, no, you just sat in judgment. 
 Look, as sentient meat, however illusory our identities are, we craft those identities by making value judgments. 
 Everybody judges, all the time. 
 Now, you got a problem with that, you're living wrong. 
 What's "scented meat"?

 MAN: Can I help you? 
 COHLE: Did you happen to live here back in '95? 
 No, we didn't live here back then. 
 This is my grandma's place. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Grandma, she still with us? 
 Alive, you mean? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, she's in an old folks' place. 
 Abbeville. 
 HART: Mrs. Hill, now, this is a very strange question, but, um, do you remember back in the winter of '94 or '95, did you get your house painted? 
 I did. Yes, I did. 
 A nice green. 
 Don't remember what they call it anymore. 
 Do you happen to remember who it was that painted your house? 
 Well, yes. 
 I don't remember the name, but they were nice men. 
 They worked for our parish. 
 Yard work, house-painting. 
 My church, they got a discount. 
 Good work for fair pay back then. 
 Mmm. 
 Do you remember, by any chance, names or just any other details? 
 Um... 
 I remember they charged $... for the whole house exterior. 
 Hmm. 
 And one of the men... the younger one... he had scarring all along the bottom of his face. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 COHLE: Miss Lilly, back then, did you or your husband work? 
 My husband, Butch, he's always worked. 
 He was offshore for City Services. 
 Did he pay his taxes? 
 Always. Heh! 
 A lot of good it did him.

 You've been really helpful. 
 LILLY: - Thank you.

 FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: And now the latest news update in the case of alleged Louisiana serial murderer Errol William Childress. 
 It's a story that first broke nationwide two weeks ago, when two former police officers, now private detectives, released information to a number of news and law enforcement agencies. 
 Our last update confirmed physical evidence at the suspect's home proved connections to dozens of missing persons. 
 In the meantime, the State Attorney General and the FBI have discredited rumors that the accused was in some way related to the family of Louisiana Senator Edwin Tuttle.

 And beneath that... darkness, there was another kind. 
 It was... it was deeper, warm, you know, like a substance. 
 I could feel, man, and I knew, I knew my daughter waited for me there.

 Yeah, you used to lay there and look up, yeah, at the stars? 
 Yeah, and you remember I... 
 I never watched a TV till I was 17, so there wasn't much to f*ckin' do out there besides walk around and explore and... 
 And... and look up at the stars and make up stories. 
 Like what? 
 [Sighs] I tell you, Marty, I've been up in that room looking out those windows every night here and just thinking... 
 It's just one story. 
 The oldest. 
 What's that? 
 Light versus dark. 
 Well, I know we ain't in Alaska, but... appears to me that the dark has a lot more territory. 
 Yeah. 
 You're right about that.

 Hey, listen, hey. 
 Yeah, what? 
 Why don't you point me in the direction of the car, man?

 You know what? 
 I'd protest, but it occurs to me that you're unkillable. 
 You want to go back, get clothes or anything? 
 No, anything I left back there, I don't need. 
 You know, you're looking at it wrong, the... sky thing. 
 How is that? 
 Well, once, there was only dark. 
 If you ask me, the light's winning.
