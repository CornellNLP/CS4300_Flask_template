 ROLAND WEST: And everything pointed to a girl being dead. 
  We were wrong. 
  Let's find out why. 
  AMELIA REARDON: The way Will's body was It's almost as if there was an element of affection in it. 
  I found this spot they played in the woods. 
  They were meeting somebody. 
  Julie had been excited about seeing an aunt? 
  She doesn't have any aunts. 
  WEST: The dolls. 
  Somebody bought 'em. 
  All we know, man's got a dead eye. 
  Sound like anybody in the community? 
  Mr. 
  Whitehead. 
  Where were you the night of the 7th? 
  - They trying to fix me up!

  WAYNE HAYS: If word's out now this girl's alive, there's a real possibility there's people somewhere don't want that to remain the case. 
  Drained quarry in southern Missouri. 
  Dental records identify the remains as Dan O'Brien.

  That'd hurt us if she don't want to be found. 
  Like Wayne said, somebody else might be lookin' for her too. 
  We're sending it to Oklahoma. 
  The Missouri State Police. 
  How much do we think this is really her? 
  I think it's her. 
  Show it to the father, see what he thinks. 
  He don't know what she looks like now any more'n we do. 
  He could make it into her, even if it's not. 
  Just give him somethin' else to hurt about, and I ain't gonna do that to the man. 
  So we don't know it's her. 
  We find her, we can ask. 
  What else? 
  I got the file on the mother, Lucy, from Clark County Sheriff's. 
  August 12th, 1988. 
  Housekeeping found her, motel in Paradise, Nevada, right outside Vegas. 
  She'd been stayin' there 'bout three weeks. 
  The OD fits.

  Had one guy said a plainclothes took his statement, but there's no record of that interview.

  All right, I'm sorry. 
  I never, uh I never saw that room. 
  Is that where she was livin'? 
  You shouldn't've seen that.

  [SIRENS APPROACH.] 
  I'm countin', Sarge. 
  [SIRENS WAILING.] 
  [TIRES SCREECH.] 
  [PANTING.] 
  Hey, hey, hey! 
  TOM: I'm speakin' to Julie now in the hopes that she's out there. 
  Julie, if you see or hear this, please, please call. 
  Call me or call the police number. 
  I'm sorry I let these years go by. 
  But I love you forever, Julie, and we just want to know that you're okay. 
  And for you to know that you can come home. 
  And if somebody's keeping you from coming home, we won't stop lookin' for you, sweetheart. 
  I'll never stop now. 
  And anyone who might know anything about my daughter, I ask you to please come forward. 
  The police have got a hotline, and there'll be a reward for any information that leads us to her. 
  Please, keep Julie in your prayers. 
  God bless. 
  REPORTER: Do you now believe that Mr. 
  Woodard was innocent? 
  What about the evidence? 
  I don't know. 
  I-I just know that my daughter's out there, and for so long I thought she wasn't. 
  REPORTER 2: Do you think the police fumbled the initial investigation? 
  KINDT: Mr. 
  Purcell won't be taking questions right now. 
  REPORTER 3: Mr. 
  Attorney General, what about this petition to have the original conviction overturned? 
  The possibility of the Purcell girl being alive doesn't change our conclusion that Brett Woodard murdered Will Purcell and kidnapped his sister. 
  Now, what he may have done with her, we can't know. 
  ALAN: David and Josie Woodard want their father's name cleared. 
  Now, we all understand the violence Brett Woodard committed, and view it as the reaction of a man persecuted by the violence of others. 
  And regardless, we insist he is not guilty of hurtin' those children. 
  We contend his posthumous conviction was fraudulent and a significant dereliction of duty on the part of the prosecutin' attorney's office. 
  REPORTER: Is this a mandate against Gerald Kindt? 
  It's a mandate against the lack of due process that could allow somethin' like this to happen. 
  - Excuse me. 
  - What about the evidence found at the Woodard place [REPORTERS CHATTER.] 
  Where was this Perry Mason sh1t in '80? 
  Even bein' a lawyer, you ought to know this is outta line. 
  Press is the only language he understands. 
  You're tellin' me you didn't enjoy that look on his face? 
  It's not about you, or your old boss. 
  Maybe consider that man tryin' to get his daughter back. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  - Those his kids? 
  - Uh-huh. 
  They know who I am? 
  m*therf*cker made me carry his water. 
  Like I need more of them memories. 
  It's good to see you back on the job, Detective Hays. 
  Freddy around? 
  He's changing oil. 
  Can't take anything new. 
  We're old friends. 
  Who remembers? 
  I saw the Trash Man guy, Woodard, but he was headin' away from Devil's Den. 
  Them two kids was ridin' towards it. 
  Don't mean anything. 
  He coulda doubled back. 
  Yeah, sure. 
  I mean, he did it, right? 
  And you're the one killed him, huh? 
  I seen you in the paper back then. 
  We just wanted to know if you remembered that night. 
  Maybe you could take us through it again. 
  You must be a stone-cold killer, huh? 
  - Plenty tough with teenagers. 
  - ROLAND: That night, you told us Will was alone when you saw him. 
  Where was the girl? 
  - Where was the sister? 
  - How would I know? 
  He was all nervous, like, "I can't find my sister. 
  I don't know where they went. 
  " "They"? 
  He said "they"? 
  I'm pretty sure he did. 
  I don't know, you wanna slap me around some, make sure? 
  He give you any indication who they might be? 
  You two can't be very good at your job. 
  Comin' back ten years later, try hangin' this on me. 
  Nobody's hangin' anything on you. 
  Maybe killer here wants to see can he make me piss my pants. 
  That don't seem like a very tall order. 
  Come on, then. 
  Bounce me off the walls, you black m*therf*cker. 
  'Cause you think there's something you can do to me, you might wanna take another look at my life. 
  Hold on, now. 
  Mr. 
  Burns, I understand your hard feelin's. 
  But we just needed you to remember. 
  And not for nothin'. 
  Things might be what they are 'cause you're the type like bullyin' somebody weaker than you. 
  Hmm. 
  And you don't? 
  I was a teenager, me. 
  What's your excuse? 
  I wanna thank you for your help, Mr. 
  Burns. 
  Maybe you let me know, you remember anything else. 
  Mrs. 
  Burns. 
  Don't you wanna call me a shit-heel twerp again? 
  Tell me how I'm gonna get ass-raped? 
  Believe that guy? 
  Actin' like I ruined his life? 
  Please explain to me all the hardships and tribulations of bein' a white man in this country. 
  Verified Woodard's location, which don't mean much. 
  But "they" Makes me think we need to get back on who those kids were meetin' in the forest. 
  I'm gonna tell you, when I was his age, age he was in the room with us, I was in the f*ckin' jungle. 
  And them toys we found in the woods? 
  We need to run those unknown prints again. 
  They didn't even have a database in '80. 
  I made the kid skip college? 
  So what do you think? 
  I think that whole generation's a bunch of pussies. 
  ROLAND: You left Mena, 16. 
  You been on the streets this whole time? 
  I been all over. 
  Went as far west as Boulder a few years back. 
  WAYNE: You said you recognize this woman? 
  Yeah. 
  With the same crew a while. 
  You know, other kids. 
  We had a good little family. 
  But she didn't stay long. 
  What's her name? 
  Mary, she said. 
  Mary July. 
  Was that her real name? 
  I don't know. 
  She tell you anything about herself? 
  Where she was from? 
  I wasn't close with her or anything. 
  A little nutty. 
  How's that? 
  Like, couldn't get straight on what year it was. 
  Tell some story how she's a secret princess or somethin'. 
  Any idea where she mighta gone? 
  No, sir. 
  Really. 
  I'd try talkin' to workin' girls. 
  A lot of 'em end up trickin'. 
  She ever do drugs? 
  Not that I saw. 
  Some of her stories, seemed like she used. 
  She's, uh a "princess. 
  " From "the pink rooms. 
  " I don't know. 
  Hey. 
  said she'd lost a brother. 
  She was lookin' for her brother. 
  That's right. 
  - Did she - What happened with her brother? 
  - She say? 
  - [STAMMERS.] 
  I think they got put apart when she was young, I dunno. 
  - She act like she was runnin' from anybody? 
  - I don't know. 
  You hear that kind of thing, but everybody on the road's runnin' from somebody. 
  Write down names. 
  Anybody in that crew with ya, anybody else mighta known her. 
  [SCOFFS.] 
  They're not in trouble. 
  And they'll get a favor to call in with the police. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  Mary July? 
  Don't know that's our girl. 
  It's her. 
  The missin' brother. 
  That's her. 
  I'm just sayin' don't want us fixatin'. 
  Hey. 
  Till we find her, this is her. 
  Hookers and runaways. 
  Let's go. 
  - What about - OLD WAYNE: Spent a few days all over the place. 
  - called "Mary. 
  " - Runaways, workin' girls. 
  - Ask you a coupla questions. 
  - Nobody knew. 
  Or maybe they did, but nobody talked to us. 
  Were you aware that one of the officers who processed the Woodard scene, Harris James, went missing in 1990 during the second investigation? 
  Who? 
  [SIGHS.] 
  No. 
  No, I didn't. 
  Who was that? 
  The field statements said you talked to him in '90. 
  A lot people around this thing are dead. 
  A lot of people gone. 
  People do that, miss. 
  Most people I ever knew are gone. 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING.] 
  Foxwood. 
  They've done all right, huh? 
  Hate these suburbs. 
  Like a plastic factory.

  I said, "You're an adult. 
  You can afford to own a home.

  Too much commitment for this one. 
  Naw, just, like, if somethin's needs fixin', I pick up the phone and say, "Fix this sh1t. 
  " Now I gotta fix this sh1t. 
  You two been together this whole time? 
  Since '80? 
  I saw these two meet. 
  And I saw you two meet. 
  I messed with him a bit first time he saw you. 
  LORI: We were together two years, and then we split. 
  And about three years later, we run into each other at the IGA. 
  [LAUGHS.] 
  So this time now, we're on five years. 
  I add 'em together. 
  I say seven years with a little vacation in between. 
  So when's the big day? 
  Well, that is touchy.

  ROLAND: We found a runaway. 
  The guy knew her. 
  We tried askin' others, street kids, but they ain't talkin' to us.

  Excuse me. 
  You have a lovely home. 
  [POURS WINE.] 
  Thanks. 
  AMELIA: "There surely exists a mutable area of soul where grief is indistinguishable from madness. 
  Standing above the box of her children's things, she wept and clutched her chest. 
  'This wasn't a happy home. 
  Children should laugh, you know? 
  And there wasn't much laughter around here. 
  '" [WHISPERS.] 
  "Should laugh. 
  " "Children should laugh. 
  " "Children should laugh. 
  " Oh The f*ck?

  - Thanks again. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES.] 
  - You didn't tell her about the divorce? 
  - What? 
  How you referred to me the other day as your ex-husband. 
  In Sallisaw. 
  What? 
  You went to Sallisaw? 
  Why didn't you tell me? 
  Why would I? 
  I didn't just go to Sallisaw. 
  I found footage of her. 
  Julie. 
  Yeah. 
  I got her on film now. 
  You have? 
  - You didn't tell me? 
  - Are you state police? 
  Seemed like you were gettin' real comfortable, havin' secrets. 
  I let this dumb detective think I was single. 
  He talked. 
  So what? 
  Maybe I thought you took this a little more serious. 
  Now I know. 
  No sweat. 
  You know what this is? 
  You trying to control me. 
  Now you're running around doing your thing, you want me home, washing clothes, making dinner. 
  This will shock you, but I have bigger dreams than just making a house for you to brood in. 
  I did nothin' but support you, whole time, years, while you worked on that f*ckin' book. 
  Yeah, as long as I was around, saw to the kids, kept your house. 
  Well, now you're all over the place, meetin' interesting men, tellin' 'em about your ex-husband. 
  Do you really think that I did something with that detective? 
  I think No, I don't. 
  But I think you're a tourist, okay? 
  I think you're a voyeur. 
  Lifting yourself up on people's bad luck. 
  That's not what I do. 
  Or did. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Yeah. 
  You I think you use people. 
  Like we're all stories to you, and you use 'em to make yourself bigger than us. 
  I see you too, baby. 
  Y-You're using this case to avoid home. 
  You're smoking again Smellin' my clothes now, Ma? 
  We're all just things in your way. 
  Ten years, and you never got me right. 
  You never got yourself right. 
  Stop pretending that you're too dumb to know that you're full of sh1t. 
  Well, soon as you dig your way out, lend me the shovel. 
  - [CHILD COUGHING.] 
  - What's wrong, baby girl? 
  She's sick. 
  She can't breathe.

  AMELIA: "'They fed me behind bars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera, the Panther, and no man's plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away. 
  And because I had learned the ways of men, I became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan. 
  Is it not so?' 'Yes, ' said Mowgli. 
  'All the jungle fear Bagheera All except Mowgli. 
  '" "'Though thou art a man's cub, ' said the Black Panther, very tenderly, 'and even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last to the men who are thy brothers, if thou are not killed in the Council. 
  '" I announced myself and told him drop the weapon. 
  He said when he counted three, he was gonna turn and fire. 
  I let him get to two. 
  More'n I would've given him. 
  More'n he deserved. 
  I went through this twice already. 
  I know how it goes, but maybe give me some space. 
  What's happenin'? 
  How is he? 
  He's stable. 
  He's out of surgery. 
  Won't know about the leg till morning. 
  Look, we need the statement again, while it's all fresh. 
  Do not f*ckin' speak to me till tomorrow mornin'. 
  At the earliest. 
  AMELIA: Oh, God. 
  Are you okay? 
  It's all over the news, all these people dead.

  What happened?

  That looks like that boy's backpack. 
  From the all-points, the dead boy. 
  m*therf*cker. 
  It's planted. 
 
 
 
  It's bullshit. 
  You get any sleep last night? 
  There was no real trial, so nobody looked hard. 
  I know I didn't. 
  But there's no f*ckin' way that backpack was in that crawlspace when that mortar went off. 
  It's pristine. 
  How long it take to process the scene? 
  Three days? 
  Plenty of time to put it there. 
  What about the shirt? 
  Why is it burnt up? 
  I thought on that. 
  They needed to sell the girl was dead, see? 
  Somebody was movin' fast. 
  When that shootout happened, somebody saw an opportunity. 
  And our side slammed the f*ckin' door shut. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  What about Alan's people? 
  Why didn't they say anything? 
  State keeps puttin' off the subpoena. 
  They haven't seen it. 
  It's all bullshit. 
  What are we sayin'? 
  I don't know. 
  Coulda been somebody sneak in overnight. 
  I'm just sayin', nobody was compelled to look too hard. 
  [SIGHS.] 
  I don't know what to do with this right now. 
  We bring this to Blevins or Kent they shut us down for doin' the exact opposite of what we're supposed to do. 
  Oh, come on, man. 
  It's too big for that political bullshit. 
  It ain't bullshit to the Man. 
  You ever learned that, you wouldn't've been on a desk last ten years.
