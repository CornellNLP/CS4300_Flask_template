 Before there was s*x, before there was the city, there was just me, Carrie Carrie Bradshaw from Castlebury, Connecticut. 
 Our relationship never stood a chance since you never stopped comparing it to your old one. 
 Are you regretting breaking up with Weaver? No. 
 I'm sorry it didn't work out. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Well, is it mine? - Maggie, I'm engaged. 
 So I'm just on my own? I don't know what else to tell you. 
 (Voice breaking) What am I gonna do? You're gonna stay here tonight. 
 When you wake up, we'll figure out what your choices are. 
 I'll be here for you. 
 I'll help however I can. 
 I'm happy I took the leap towards Sebastian, even if my heart is in a million pieces. 
 Originally Aired on December 13, 2013 (Carrie) Joseph Conrad once said that gossip was something that no one claims to like, but everybody enjoys. 
 And that seemed to be perfectly true in New York City, where there are more daily tabloids than Ray's Original Pizzas. 
 And if I was honest, I really enjoyed it. 
 Would I lie to you? Right until I read something about me. 
 (Eurythmics) Now I would say something "When Adam Weaver, the wunderkind playwright, was asked what his next opus was based on, he succinctly said, a play about my ex, a diminutive, suburbanoseur who I broke up with. 
 " Ouch. 
 It sounds even worse when it's read out loud. 
 Why would Weaver do this to me? He called me small. 
 Tiny, really, and a phony. 
 I'd be most pissed off about "suburban. 
 " That's the kiss of death in Manhattan literary circles. 
 And P. 
 S. 
 I broke up with him. 
 I mean, don't these gossip rags fact-check? You should call them and tell them what's what. 
 I should. 
 Except then you'd have to out yourself as a diminutive, suburban poseur. 
 Then I shouldn't. 
 (Receiver clatters) I always dreamed that one day the literary world would be talking about me, but I figured it would be because they loved my insightful, provocative, and well-reviewed novella. 
 Well, some of your dream is coming true. 
 Buck up. 
 You're nobody until somebody is talking about you. 
 (Singsongy) I come bearing gifts! Well, maybe this will cheer me up. 
 Doubtful. 
 When Larissa says "gifts," she usually means menial, horrible tasks that will be given to us. 
 Beep-y things for everyone! Oh! We're getting pagers. 
 That is so cool. 
 I've always wanted a beeper. 
 It's so "St. 
 Elsewhere," being on call, being important. 
 (Scoffs) Don't kid yourself. 
 Now we're going to be tied to Andy like one of his lap dogs. 
 Scratch that. 
 His dogs are treated better than this. 
 Be lucky you're just an intern and won't get one. 
 Now Andy expects you all to be on call 24-slash-7. 
 I'm not getting paid enough for this. 
 Oh, don't be grumpy. 
 Oh, and everybody who calls here for you will be given your beeper number so they can reach you immediamente. 
 Oh, God. 
 What's next? Cellular phones for everyone? Don't be ridiculous. 
 That will never happen. 
 For me? You, my little lilliputian, have arrived. 
 Oh. 
 So you heard about the "Page Six" piece. 
 You're getting a pager, aren't you? What he said isn't even true. 
 Not that that matters. 
 Once a rumor is out there, that's the only thing people will believe. 
 (Indistinct conversations) (Chuckles) Well, well, well. 
 Looks like the rumors are true. 
 Don't believe everything you hear. 
 Oh, I don't, but I also have eyes, and you two look awfully cozy. 
 Butt out. 
 Oh, you're still sour. 
 I would assume snagging the Kydd would've put a spring in your step. 
 Yep, well, you know what they say about assuming. 
 I don't, and I don't really care. 
 I wonder what Merry Carrie would think. 
 Although I'm guessing she doesn't have much time for either of you these days, so busy with her fancy Manhattan beau. 
 Lay off, Donna, all right? Look at you, being all protective. 
 You always are when it comes to your lady friends. 
 It's sweet, really. 
 Just wish it'd been for an actual lady Instead of her. 
 I will take you and enjoy it. 
 Don't be so touchy. 
 Got what you wanted, didn't you? Okay, we have to stop this. 
 Stop what? This rumor that we're dating. 
 I don't care what those idiots think. 
 I do. 
 Not not about Donna and all those beady little eyes on us, but I-I care about Carrie. 
 I got the feeling that she was open to I don't know maybe talking, being friends again. 
 Look I didn't wanna say anything to you because of everything you're going through, but Carrie saw you the night you slept at my house. 
 What? How? I'm not sure. 
 I-I saw a car driving off, and when I opened the door, my jacket was there the one I gave her like she left it. 
 Why would she do that? To get rid of the last reminder of me? I don't know. 
 But in order to explain to her why you were there I would have to explain what's going on with me. 
 You ready to do that? No. 
 I'm just gonna have to figure out what I'm going to do. 
 What am I gonna do? Whatever you decide, I'm here, okay? (Door bells jingling) You wanna get a grilled cheese and chili fries? We always get that. 
 Milkshake? We could mix it up and add banana. 
 Nah. 
 (Sighs) I'm not even hungry. 
 (Telephone ringing) Me either. 
 We're in a food rut. 
 Wanna work on our college applications instead? Oh, my God. 
 We are so boring! No. 
 (Scoffs) No. 
 We're (Chuckles) Totally and completely boring. 
 How did this happen? - We're busy? Okay, mister, we have only been dating eight months. 
 This cannot be our lives (Door opens, bells jingle) Eating at the diner and homework. 
 We need to add some spice to our life. 
 Let's do it in your car. 
 Stat! I have to get to basketball practice. 
 Right. 
 Of course. 
 I forgot. 
 But after practice I have S. 
 A. 
 T. 
 prep. 
 We're doomed. 
 Mouse We'll be fine. 
 No, we are going to better than fine. 
 We are going to be hot! Hot, hot, hot. 
 Just not tonight. 
 (Pager beeping) - Not again. 
 Larissa? Probably. 
 Are you gonna call her back? It could be an emergency. 
 Oh, like the last call, when I had to tell her where her tampons are? Left drawer. 
 Or the call before that for her condoms right drawer. 
 Bennet said it. 
 You know, these pagers they're like gilded handcuffs. 
 Yeah. 
 Bennet's pretty P. 
 O. 
 'd about it. 
 He just feels really underappreciated at the magazine, and these beepers are the last straw. 
 Well, he's not gonna quit, is he? He's threatening to. 
 His other fantasy is to just walk right up to Andy and give him an ultimatum promotion or bust. 
 Well, from what I know about Andy, that will not go well. 
 That's what I'm worried about. 
 When it comes to work, you shouldn't draw attention to yourself except for the work, you know? Oh. 
 With all this "Page Six" drama I'm dealing with, I totally hear you. 
 (Pager beeps) Larissa? I should probably call her. 
 Maybe she can't find her douche. 
 Ew. 
 (Indistinct conversations) Are you sure? Yeah. 
 I am. 
 (Exhales deeply) I have decided to get an abortion. 
 Can you take me to my appointment? I-it's totally cool if you can't. 
 Stop. 
 I'm taking you. 
 Always wanted a ride in that car of yours. 
 (Larissa) I've been trying to reach you for ages. 
 Where have you been? Uh, class. 
 Oh, right. 
 I always forget that. 
 When do you finish at that place? This week? Um, I-it's November, so I'm I'm pretty much here until June. 
 Is there something you needed? Uh, yes, yes. 
 Tristan Cassidy called here from "Page Six. 
 " He found out you dated Weaver and is fishing around, trying to figure out if you are, and I quote "The diminutive, suburban poseur who got dumped. 
 " Oh, no. 
 "Oh, no" is right. 
 I thought you said that all all press is good press, - even bad press. 
 It is (Lowered voice) Until Andy's involved. 
 He can be very touchy about how he and the magazine are perceived. 
 There can be no poseurs in Andy's world. 
 So now what? - So now you either convince "Page Six" the subject isn't you, or you face Andy's wrath. 
 I cannot believe I'm here on a Saturday, stuffing envelopes. 
 I don't even make overtime. 
 I don't even make any money. 
 I just make cappuccinos. 
 Which are incredible. 
 Well, I'm glad you're enjoying them, because if I can't convince Tristan Cassidy that I am not some poseur, then that's what I'll be making for the rest of my life. 
 Are you going to call him back? I don't know. 
 I-I wish I could talk to him directly, in person, so he could meet me and see that I am not the lies Weaver made up. 
 I think you should just ignore the whole thing. 
 Don't give the guy more ammunition. 
 I think you should set the record straight. 
 Tell him what's what. 
 I think we should dump all these envelopes into the river and tell Andy we're too good to be stuffing envelopes on a weekend. 
 What am I, the intern? No offense. 
 Why do people always say "No offense" right after they've offended you? I work my butt off, and Andy won't even give me a feature to write. 
 Just blurbs and "Hot BoÃ®tes. 
 " I want more. 
 Who'd want more than hot butts? "Hot BoÃ®tes. 
 " It means "Cool Restaurants. 
 " Which was really fun for the first two years. 
 But I wanna keep growing in my job and not feel so taken for granted. 
 That's because Andy knows he has you. 
 A boss is like a man. 
 Once he knows he's got you, it's like practically giving him permission to ignore you. 
 It's like my parents' marriage. 
 Sounds delightful. 
 (Chuckles) Not that a man has ever ignored me. 
 But if he did, I would have ten guys lined up so he would know he's got competition. 
 Or at least make it seem that way. 
 I think that might work. 
 I'm just not exactly sure how to get to these media guys. 
 I tried cold calling once. 
 I never heard back from anyone. 
 You have to meet them on their field. 
 Seem like an equal, and preferably holding alcohol. 
 Like at the Paris party tonight. 
 The what? The Paris party. 
 Everyone who's invited puts in 50 bucks, and at the end of the night, someone's name is pulled from the hat, and that person gets to go on a trip to Paris with a friend, all paid for. 
 Oh. 
 Awesome. 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris. 
 How did I not know about this? Every fancy artist and media type will be there. 
 Well, no wonder no one appreciates me. 
 I don't even have my finger on the social pulse. 
 Lucky for you, I do. 
 You wanna go? Seriously? You can get us in? Will Tristan Cassidy be there? - I'm guessing. 
 Oh, well, then I am there. 
 Well, then let's pack our bags and get going. 
 Do you think I should wear a chapeau? I wanna look my best when I get my reputation back. 
 Mm. 
 (Samantha) Mm. 
 When you said "Spice up our lives," I did not think you meant food. 
 Those tacos were intense. 
 Oh, that was just phase one of project Mucho Caliente Relaciones. 
 What is this, a secret military operation? Keeping our relationship hot is serious business. 
 Apparently, chili peppers increase the libido. 
 I researched it. 
 But doesn't planning all this stuff take the fun out of it, makes it less spontaneous? Oh, I don't think you'll feel that way when you see the surprise I left you in your backpack. 
 (Chuckles) Not now. 
 Later. 
 Okay. 
 Part of the fun of this is the anticipation. 
 I read that anticipation is also an aphrodisiac. 
 Well, I hope not too much of one since I have to head to basketball practice. 
 (Chuckles) - See you at the game? - I'll be there. 
 In fact I can't wait. 
 See? Anticipation! Already making me feel sexy. 
 Great. 
 Well, I'll see you later. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Are you ready? I think so. 
 I just can't seem to open the door. 
 There's no rush. 
 You know, I've always wanted to be a mom. 
 Have a family. 
 You still can. 
 This doesn't change that. 
 It's all I've ever imagined, being a mom. 
 I'm not like Mouse and Carrie. 
 I don't have these big dreams. 
 This was my dream. 
 Not like this, but one day. 
 And here I am, destroying it. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 What are my options? Raise a kid by myself? Nobody does that. 
 Adoption? Or your parents can help you No. 
 They would kill me if they found out. 
 They can never know, Sebastian never. 
 (Sighs) (Crying) I'm so scared. 
 I'm getting you out of here. 
 No, my appointment. 
 Not today. 
 You can't rush this decision. 
 It's not like I have a lot of time on this. 
 I know. 
 But it can wait a day or two. 
 I just don't want you to make a decision you're gonna regret. 
 Me either. 
 Do you want me to take you home? Can we just drive for a little? Yeah, sure. 
 Hey, West. 
 You got those pages coach gave us for the flex offense? Yeah, sure do. 
 Awesome. 
 Can't believe he gave us all these new plays right before our first conference game. 
 That's why we're doing these additional practices. 
 And don't worry. 
 I think it'd be a cool thing to add to our game. 
 Mix things up a bit. 
 Says the guy with a photographic memory. 
 Faith, Pendleton. 
 We'll make it work. 
 All right, see you out there. 
 Boobs. 
 (Nouvelle Vague) When I'm with you, baby I go out of my head I just can't get enough I just can't get enough This is so exciting. 
 I just can't get enough Oh, we're not going in that way. 
 Huh? We're going in this way. 
 and I just can't seem to get enough I thought you knew people. 
 I do. 
 Alvaro, the busboy. 
 Hey! Gracias, Alvaro! Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡ su niÃ±a? Bien, bien, seÃ±orita Samantha. 
 You are such a sweet girl. 
 We worked together a few months back. 
 He only busboys the best events. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 This is terrible idea. 
 Carrie, you're just going to add fuel to the story by addressing it. 
 And, Bennet, just let your work be the thing people notice. 
 You don't need to be running around a party like a peacock asking for attention. 
 Are you insane? In order to get ahead, you need to not just work, but work it. 
 And, Carrie, if you don't destroy the idea that you're some unimportant poseur, that rumor will become the truth before you even know what hit you. 
 Now there is a free trip to Paris out there just waiting for us, not to mention free booze and some canapÃ©. 
 So pick up a tray And get out there. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go! Samantha was right. 
 I had to face these rumors head-on, and the people who had written them. 
 (Indistinct conversations) And I just can't seem to get enough I just didn't expect to be face-to-face with the man who had started them. 
 You okay with that tray? - Yeah. 
 Sure. 
 I, uh Couldn't find the bar, so I just grabbed this. 
 (1933's "Signal To The Heart" playing) Can never have too much champagne, right? - Yeah. 
 And I-I'm here with people, so They're thirsty, too. 
 Sure. 
 You mind if I No, not at all. 
 Yeah, you know, I think I might have one, too, now. 
 (Indistinct conversations) So how is everything? It's good. 
 Yeah, it's good. 
 You? Working on my new play, and "Strange Angels" is Is in rehearsals. 
 We open in about a month. 
 Oh, and we got, uh, Andrew McCarthy for the lead. 
 That's amazing. 
 (Chuckles) You hadn't heard? Nope. 
 I've been busy with stuff. 
 Oh, well, I'll let you go. 
 I know you've got a tray of drinks to hand out to your people. 
 (Chuckles) Yep. 
 Sure do. 
 It was great seeing you, Carrie. 
 Yeah, you, too. 
 I am on record saying this whole thing is a bad idea. 
 Oh, my God. 
 There's Tristan Cassidy. 
 Should I go talk to him? - No! - Yes! What would I say? - Tristan! - I'm going. 
 You Tristan! Yoo-hoo! Tristan, darling. 
 (Kisses) So good to see you. 
 You may not remember me, but we met a few weeks ago at Odeon. 
 It was a long night. 
 Right, right, of course. 
 Oh, and you remember my friend Bennet from "Interview. 
 " Sure. 
 Sure. 
 Bennet Wilcox, and this is Walt. 
 Hey. 
 Darlings! Oh, mwah! Mwah! How exciting! You're all here! You're Tristan Cassidy. 
 Yes, I am. 
 Charmed. 
 Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get a drink. 
 Mind if I join you? Not at all. 
 It's great seeing you again. 
 (Bennet) - You, too. 
 You didn't tell me you know Tristan Cassidy. 
 You didn't tell us about this party. 
 Oh, this is the hottest ticket in town. 
 I certainly wasn't gonna waste it on you. 
 Why? Because you're you. 
 And I always see you. 
 But if you win the trip to Paris, you must take me. 
 I insist. 
 (Chuckles) I would take Walt. 
 Of course. 
 So predictable. 
 But what isn't predictable is that you finagled a ticket to this. 
 Very impressed. 
 Andy always worries you don't have what it takes to get all access. 
 A-Andy thinks that? (Indistinct conversations) Well, I guess Andy thinks wrong. 
 Andy is never wrong. 
 About Bennet, he is. 
 He didn't just get us into the party. 
 He got Carrie and Samantha in, too. 
 Bennet's a big deal. 
 Big. 
 In fact Tristan was just over here discussing Bennet's future plans. 
 (Indistinct conversations) You wouldn't leave "Interview" for him, would you? - I - They're talking. 
 So. 
 . 
 Did you like my surprise? I did. 
 It was amazing. 
 Were you shocked? Not really. 
 You know what I like. 
 Yeah. 
 I do. 
 Although I wish I hadn't eaten it before the game. 
 My stomach hurts a little bit. 
 What do you mean, ate it? The chocolate bar you left in my bag. 
 I didn't leave a chocolate bar in your bag. 
 You didn't? - No. 
 I left you a surprise in your notebook. 
 Then where was the chocolate bar from? That really doesn't matter. 
 Did you see a picture in your notebook? Didn't even look. 
 Well Look now! Oh, I remember. 
 I bought that chocolate bar a few weeks ago. 
 I do not care about that stupid chocolate bar. 
 
 
 
 (Flipping pages) Do you see it? 
 No. 
 It must have fallen out or something. 
 Maybe it's in here. 
 Hold this. 
 It's not in here. 
 Maybe if you told me what it was It was a picture of me Topless. 
 Oh, no way. 
 That's awesome. 
 You need to get focused, buddy. 
 This is a serious problem if the photo has gone missing. 
 Right, right, of course. 
 (Clears throat) You need to find that picture and make sure no one figures out it's me. 
 Won't they be able to tell when they see it's a picture of you? It's just my boobs, not my face. 
 Why? For this very reason! You need to trace your steps so we can figure this out. 
 Where were you last? The locker room. 
 (Whispers) No. 
 (Normal voice) No! No! I'm on it, I'm on it. 
 (Gasping) Boys, boys, boys, how could you ever think these were mine? Way too small. 
 They're perky, though. 
 What you looking at? Fun bags. 
 Sweet. 
 Whose? That's what we're trying to figure out. 
 Wanna see? (Boys chuckle) Maybe one of the Jens? Eh, not them. 
 They're flat as pancakes. 
 All right, boys. 
 Game time. 
 I wanna see some heads-up ball out there. 
 (Boy) Let's go, boys. 
 (Indistinct conversations) You comin'? Be right there. 
 While West was relieved to know his crisis was over (Horn honks) I was still trying to manage mine, and that meant getting answers from Weaver. 
 We meet again. 
 Yeah, well, it's not such a big party, so it's probably inevitable. 
 And I wanted to talk to you. 
 Well, I'm always happy to see you. 
 Mm-hmm, me, too. 
 And I'm really glad that you don't seem to have any, um, hard feelings for You know, the way we ended. 
 I don't at all. 
 It just didn't work out. 
 So why did you say those things about me to "Page Six"? Were you misquoted? Not at all. 
 In fact, I was very careful about the words I chose. 
 I'm a wordsmith, after all. 
 Well, then if you're not mad, why did you say those things? In this city, everything is about perception. 
 Who was the Victor and who was the vanquished? And in order for me to come out on top, you had to take the hit. 
 It wasn't personal. 
 You can't be serious. 
 I mean, we were in a relationship an intimate one, and I-I cared about you. 
 You cared about me? Is that why you broke up with me and ran right back to that guy, because you cared about me? It wasn't like that, really. 
 (Scoffs) You're just lucky I didn't name you. 
 But I can if you want. 
 (Chuckles) I know Tristan Cassidy's been sniffing around for your name. 
 And he is right over there. 
 (Speaking indistinctly) Well, unlucky for you, he's talking to my friends. 
 (Indistinct conversations) Sorry to interrupt. 
 Um Would you like a hot story on the wunderkind Adam Weaver? The story he gave you? Total lie. 
 He he's pathological, really. 
 Every girl dumps him because he's a needy, insecure b*st*rd. 
 And he's no wunderkind in the bedroom, either. 
 Teeny-tiny. 
 At least that's what I've heard. 
 It's true. 
 Can I quote you on that? Definitely. 
 And you are? Katja Morningstar. 
 One of his exes. 
 (Pager beeps) Excuse me. 
 Thank you for the story. 
 Oh. 
 My pleasure. 
 (Coin drops) (Line clicks, dial tone) (Dials) (Telephone rings) Hello? Sebastian? Yeah, it's me. 
 What's going on? Look, I-I'm sorry to bother you, and I wouldn't call unless it was important. 
 It's Maggie. 
 She collapsed. 
 Sebastian. 
 What happened? What what's wrong with her? They don't know. 
 I was taking her home from And she just collapsed. 
 They're running tests now. 
 Well, I'm sorry it took so long. 
 There was traffic. 
 Oh, I'm just grateful you're here. 
 I didn't know who else to call. 
 (Telephone ringing in distance) You must hate that I always lean on you. 
 I don't hate that. 
 (Woman speaking indistinctly over P. 
 A. 
 ) So where are her parents? Did you call them? Maggie doesn't want them to know she's here. 
 What could possibly be going on that she doesn't want her parents to know? I shouldn't say anything. 
 Maggie doesn't I mean (Inhales deeply) She's pregnant? (Woman speaking indistinctly over P. 
 A. 
 ) Is she pregnant? Look, Carrie, it's not mine. 
 Carrie, Carrie, it's Simon's. 
 Wait. 
 What? Maggie and I we're not anything but friends. 
 She's just been going through so much, and and I wanted to be there for her. 
 So you and Maggie aren't dating? No. 
 Well, what about when I came to your house with with your jacket? I She was upset and needed a place to crash. 
 That's it. 
 (Exhales) Why why did you come that night? I keep wondering. 
 (Exhales) I just needed to see you To tell you that I missed you. 
 I miss you, too, so much 'Cause I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Bennet doesn't like to brag, but I'm happy to. 
 Tristan Cassidy of "Page Six" was just talking to him about making a move, so if any of you are interested And you'd be crazy not to be I would make one also. 
 Very excited. 
 Can't wait to sit down with you guys. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow! Look at you, Bennet. 
 Working it. 
 It wasn't me. 
 It was Walt. 
 He was amazing. 
 What happened to peacocks are beneath you? I guess I just got angry. 
 When Larissa was so surprised to see you here, it made me realize they don't appreciate you. 
 And I realized I don't either. 
 Of course you do. 
 No, I was thinking about when I first met you and how I couldn't even believe I was meeting the guy who wrote my favorite column, "Hot BoÃ®tes. 
 " It was so huge. 
 And I have to remember that. 
 You're amazing, and I don't ever wanna take you for granted. 
 (Camera shutter clicking) God, I love you. 
 Aw. 
 And I love that you were a peacock for me. 
 It was so sexy seeing you strut your stuff. 
 (Both chuckle) (Camera shutter clicking) Okay, that's enough. 
 Now you're just making me sick, you're so happy. 
 (Woman speaking indistinctly over P. 
 A. 
 ) Carrie. 
 What is going on? Where is my baby? Mrs. 
 Landers Mr. 
 Landers? I'm Sebastian Kydd. 
 Are you the b*st*rd who took advantage of my daughter? I've heard the stories about you and your no-good father, using your money to buy people off. 
 Well, you're not gonna buy me off. 
 Mr. 
 Landers, please, if you could just listen Carrie, don't. 
 You are a lowlife, getting my daughter pregnant? Putting her life at risk? I'm gonna put my fist through your face. 
 Eddie, now is not the time. 
 We need to find the doctor. 
 And keeping us in the dark just so you can cover your own hide? It's a good thing one of the nurses who works here is married to one of my guys and called us, did the right thing, you coward, little punk! Look, Mr. 
 Landers, I-I know we're all upset, okay, but if you could please, just take a breath. 
 I have an update. 
 Okay, these are Maggie's parents. 
 I'm Eddie Landers, Chief of Police. 
 This is my wife Brenda. 
 It appears your daughter has an ectopic pregnancy. 
 What is that? It means the pregnancy took in her fallopian tube instead of in the uterus. 
 You can fix it, right? - She's hemorrhaging, so we need to operate immediately, and it's a pretty long and invasive surgery. 
 Until we see how much damage there is, she's at risk. 
 How much risk? Life-threatening. 
 Oh, my God. 
 My baby. 
 Can we go see her? We're prepping her now for the O. 
 R. 
 , but, uh, Sally can take you back. 
 Why didn't you tell Maggie's parents the truth, that you're not the father? 'Cause it's not my story to tell. 
 It's Maggie's. 
 But she's in surgery, fighting for her life. 
 And she wouldn't want her parents, especially her dad, to know she was involved with Simon. 
 I promised her. 
 Do you not understand what people will think of you? I know. 
 But it's not the truth. 
 I can't stop the rumors, Carrie. 
 But you can. 
 I mean, all you have to do is be honest. 
 How are we supposed to be together if everyone thinks you knocked up my best friend? It's not about us right now. 
 It's about Maggie, and she needs us. 
 But what will people think? I don't give a damn what people think, and neither should you. 
 What took you so long? I've been playing a basketball game. 
 We won, by the way. 
 I know. 
 I was watching. 
 So you know I did great with eight rebounds. 
 Did you get the picture or not? I did, and thank you. 
 So no one saw it. 
 What a relief. 
 Well not exactly. 
 (Clears throat) What do you mean? Some people might have seen it. 
 How many? The whole team. 
 (Gasps) (Whispers) I can't breathe. 
 (Gasps) I can't breathe. 
 But no one knew who it was. 
 I promise. 
 How do you know? Because everyone's trying to guess who it was. 
 Well, did they guess me? Nope. 
 Your name never came up. 
 Are you sure? I need to hear exactly what was said. 
 I think Donna said something about how they were small but very perky. 
 Donna was there in the locker room? She said my boobs were perky? And then they were like, "maybe it was the Jens. 
 " So my name never came up? Never. 
 Why? What do you mean? Well do people not think I could have perky boobs? Mouse, don't go there. 
 Now I am just insulted. 
 (Microphone feedback whines) (Amplified voice) Hope everybody is ready. 
 In a few minutes, I will announce the winner of our trip to Paris. 
 Imagine if one of us actually won. 
 Ahh. 
 I suddenly realized if we did, I'd have no way of explaining this to my parents. 
 And I don't have a passport. 
 (Chuckles) Hey, guys. 
 Carrie's not here. 
 She's gone. 
 And your name's gonna be all over the "Post" tomorrow. 
 What did she say? Well, let's just say you might see the word "diminutive" again, but this time in reference to you and one of your body parts. 
 But that's a lie. 
 Like what you said to "Page Six"? Doesn't feel so good, does it? They can't print stuff about me that isn't true. 
 Sure they can. 
 They called you a "Wunderkind," didn't they? (Laughs) (Clink) Andy heard you were being sought after by several papers, and he wants it to stop. 
 How did he know? He has eyes everywhere. 
 That's what makes him so Scary? Is he angry? Andy's giving you a raise and a promotion to features editor! (Laughs) Oh, my God. 
 (Clink) This is the best night of my life. 
 (Kisses) (Woman) Quiet down, everyone. 
 (Microphone feedback whines) Quiet down. 
 We have a Paris winner. 
 Please let it be me, please let it be moi. 
 Mademoiselle Carrie Bradshaw, grab your chapeau and head to your waiting limo. 
 (Applause) You are leaving for Paris anon. 
 She isn't here! Why isn't she here? Carrie Bradshaw? Samantha, you should go. 
 We're all here because of you. 
 Really? Where are you, darling? (Singsongy) Carrie Bradshaw! She's right here! Here she is! I'm Carrie! Carrie Bradshaw! Any word? (Woman over P. 
 A. 
 ) Dr. 
 Kim, you have a call on line 7. 
 Dr. 
 Kim, you have a call on line 7. 
 (Elevator bell dings, doors open) Look I know people will hate me and that I'm basically a pariah. 
 But I don't care. 
 The only thing I care about is that you know the truth. 
 The rumors, the gossip it's not real. 
 That's just noise. 
 It was such a different perspective from Weaver's, where perception was everything. 
 But people will always be looking at you and judging. 
 I know. 
 I can handle it. 
 Question is can you? Well? She made it through surgery. 
 We couldn't save the fallopian tube, but she's alive. 
 Well, what does that mean? It means a future pregnancy will be a lot more difficult. 
 God. 
 Does she know? - Not yet. 
 Well, can we see her? She'll be groggy, but yes. 
 Okay, where are her parents? - They're talking to the surgical team now, so you guys can head in. 
 (Woman speaking indistinctly over P. 
 A. 
 ) You comin'? Um yeah. 
 I just have to do this one thing first. 
 I'll meet you in there. 
 (Woman speaking indistinctly over P. 
 A. 
 ) (Beeping) (Line rings, click) (Larissa) - Hello? - Larissa. 
 It's me. 
 Darling! You should not have left. 
 You won the trip to Paris. 
 I did? Samantha took it and went with the busboy. 
 (Huffs) Good for her and Alvaro. 
 (Chuckles) I've always wanted to go to Paris. 
 Oh, someday, mon amie. 
 Someday. 
 Um, well, I-I know you're busy, but I just wanted to know if Tristan Cassidy is still there. 
 I need to talk to him. 
 Yeah, he's He's right here, my love. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What is this all about? Oh, you're gonna wanna chat with this one. 
 She's got Los of dirt. 
 Hello? Hi. 
 Uh this is the girl who told you about Adam Weaver and his pen1s size. 
 Oh, right, Katja. 
 Right. 
 Katja. 
 Um well, the thing is, that isn't really true About his manhood. 
 And I don't think it would be fair to have a lie out there, even though it wouldn't kill Weaver to have a dose of his own medicine. 
 Oh, it's too late, kiddo. 
 I already called it in. 
 And if I don't print that, I've got nothing. 
 But it's not true. 
 Well, it's not untrue. 
 Yes, it is. 
 That's what "not true" means. 
 What if I were to give you something else? Like what? Like the name of Weaver's diminutive, suburban poseur. 
 You know who it is? Yeah. 
 It's me. 
 Carrie Bradshaw. 
 I thought your name was Katja. 
 Well, I lied. 
 Well, how do I know you're telling the truth, then? Didn't you see how tiny I am? That's a good point. 
 All right, I'm gonna go with it. 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
 But I gotta ask you, why the hell are you giving yourself up? At the end of the day, it's just words. 
 I had to give myself up, but it was worth it to know I didn't sell someone else out to save my own skin. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I hope it's okay that I'm here. 
 It's more than okay. 
 I'm so sorry, Mags. 
 I'm here for you, always. 
 Whatever you need. 
 Right now I would just love it if you guys would sit here with me. 
 (Indistinct conversations) Hello, boys. 
 (Door bells jingle) (Fabric flaps) Whoa. 
 That's right. 
 They're mine. 
 (Door bells jingle) That's my girl. 
 (Laughter) Look at you, dude. 
 There are so many soirees now in the city. 
 It's hard to keep up. 
 I know. 
 Every week a different charity event. 
 They wrote about one last night where someone won a trip to Paris. 
 Isn't that gauche? (Newspaper thuds) These events should be to give back, not to take. 
 I see what you mean. 
 ('Til Tuesday's "Voices Carry" playing) Do you? I'm in the dark, I'd like to read his mind but I'm frightened of the things I might find Oh, there must be something he's thinking of to tear him away the doctor told me if you hadn't brought her here, she might have died. 
 So I am grateful. 
 But from now on You stay away from her. 
 I'm telling you, son, do not test me, or so help me, you will find yourself in a world of hurt. 
 Voices carry now get the hell outta here. 
 Hush, hush keep it down now voices carry hush, hush keep it down now voices carry oh, hush, hush shut up now voices carry oh, oh, hush, hush I love you, and I know you're a good person the best, really and that's all that matters. 
 Hush, darling Everything else is just noise. 
 hush, hush voices carry hush, hush voices carry voices carry
