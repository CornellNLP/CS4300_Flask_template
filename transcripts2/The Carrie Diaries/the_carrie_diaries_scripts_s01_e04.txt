 Before there was s*x, before there was the city, there was just me... Carrie. Carrie Bradshaw. It's 1984. Ronald Reagan and shoulder pads were all the rage. I'm trying to figure out who I am with the help of my family, my best friends, a sexy new guy... 
 Did your father say why he won't let you date Sebastian? 
 Ah, he's probably just being overprotective. 
 This isn't gonna happen. What do you mean? 
 Us. You and me. 
 And a hot new city. 
 Your life is just so... Exotic. 
 Honestly, Carrie, it's like you've never had s*x. 
 Well, compared to you, it feels like I haven't. 
 Well, you let me know if this bad boy of yours doesn't work out. 
 I've got 40 more I can introduce you to when we next go out. 
 Figuring out who I was and finding my voice 
 wasn't going to be easy, 
 but I was pretty sure it was going to be a lot of fun. 
 The scariest thing about High School... 
 When someone breaks your heart,  it's such a small place that you can't avoid them. 
 It's ironic. 
 The time in your life when you're least capable 
 of managing your emotions is the same time 
 you're locked up for eight hours a day 
 with the people responsible for those emotions 
 in the first place. 
 It was like I was living in my own personal horror film... 
 "The rise of the boy who broke my heart." 
 ♪ I always feel like somebody's watching me ♪ 
 And apparently it was playing everywhere. 
 ♪ I always feel like somebody's watching me ♪ 
♪ Tell me, is it just a dream? 
 It's like he's everywhere. 
 Who knew this school was so small? 
 Me. When Maggie and I broke up, I darted around every corner like she might be waiting there to throw something at me. 
 Luckily, she ended up being pretty cool about it. 
 Well, the same cannot be said for me. 
 It's hard, but it'll get better, I promise. 
 How soon? 
 Soon-ish. Even with Maggie, I feel like things are still loaded sometimes. 
 Like today. 
 Halloween was a holiday we always did together. 
 I'm worried she might be sad. 
 I think she's okay. 
 And I'm just selfishly glad I get you tonight. 
 Me, too! I can't wait to go Larissa's party. 
 Thanks for asking me. 
 It starts at, like, 8:00. 
 Lots of liquor, no costumes. All right? 
 Oh. We need to turn around now. 
 Carrie. Sebastian. 
 Walt. Sebastian. 
 Looks like we all know each other's names, so that's good. 
 So you got any, uh, special plans for tonight? Nah. 
 Wow. 'Cause I just heard you invite someone to a party... 
 Assuming one you're having. 
 We should go. 
 No, it's... it's fine. 
 Walt and I are going to a party tonight in the city, so I don't care. 
 Just... think it's weird you didn't invite me. 
 Would you have wanted me to? 
 Well, would have been polite. 
 Look, Carrie, it wouldn't have been polite. 
 Would've just been awkward. 
 We both know that. Yeah. 
 Just trying to be honest. 
 Of course. Right. 
 Um... well, we should go. 
 I can't believe Sebastian's renting out the diner for a Halloween party. 
 I can't even escape him in here. 
 If he had any decency, he'd switch schools. 
 Yes, he would. Selfish jerk. Seriously. 
 Wait. I'm confused. 
 You guys don't even feel a  little  bad for Sebastian? 
 Um,  no.  Why would we? 
 Because Carrie snooped through all his private legal files and told us all that he slept with his teacher? 
 Walt, this is what we do. We get our hearts broken, and then we demonize the guys who broke up with us. 
 Don't worry. I'm not bad-mouthing you yet. 
 Um... thanks? 
 You're welcome. 
 I know I made a mistake, and I wanted to talk to Sebastian about it, except he was like, "discussion's over. I'm out"" 
 I mean, is it my fault he wouldn't even talk about it? 
 And what kind of a guy does that? A jerk. That's what kind. 
 I say good riddance. If you were still dating Sebastian, you'd have to spend Halloween with him. 
 Now you are footloose and fancy-free. 
 And you totally loved "footloose." 
 You know what? 
 This is the first Halloween I've looked forward to in years. 
 I've always had to take care of Dorrit and keep her from doing something crazy, but not tonight. Tonight you and I are going to Larissa's Halloween party. In soho. 
 And we're not gonna think about selfish boys or delinquent little sisters or any of our responsibilities. 
 We're just gonna have an incredible time... 
 Yeah. And think about ourselves. 
 It's going to be nothing but fun. 
 So what are you two going as? 
 Let's just say I have a costume that is to  "di"  for. 
 My little princess Di. 
 Okay, one more. 
 Well, I'm glad you're finally getting a night out on the town, but I am a little sad that you won't be taking Dorrit trick-or-treating this year. 
 Dad, Dorrit hasn't gone trick-or-treating in years. 
 Really? 
 Well, I guess I miss out on a lot, being the candy man at home. Yeah. 
 Like me chasing Dorrit around town, trying to stop her from T.P.-Ing our principal's house. 
 That is a tradition... Of sorts. 
 Super fun one. 
 Well, it's nice to see you maintaining a tradition of your own... Dressing up as Chewbacca and handing out the goods to kids. 
 You're Chewbacca every year? 
 It was an expensive costume. 
 Besides, I spent a long time getting the roar just right. 
 Lame. 
 Oh! Dorrit, get in the picture. 
 That way, I can get all of you in your Halloween costumes. 
 This isn't a costume. 
 Oh. Well... 
 Then how about for old times' sake, huh? Sweetie? 
 Halloween is stupid. 
 So I take it you won't be going out tonight. 
 Do I look like a loser? 
 I'll be in my room. 
 Okay. 
 Well, this will be fun. 
 As my last responsible act before I leave, I should tell you that I know that look, and she's so going out, and it's not gonna be pretty. 
 Dad, I'm serious. 
 I'd start checking the closets. 
 Make sure she's not hiding anything she could use to blow up Castlebury. 
 You wanna tell me what you were planning on doing with all this? 
 I've never seen that stuff before. 
 Maybe it's Carrie's? 
 Okay. 
 All right, then you won't mind that I'm taking it or that I moved the ladder from outside your window. 
 Looks like you're in for the night. 
 And while Dorrit's chances of escape were dwindling... 
 Mine were looking good. 
 Uh... I think we're a little overdressed. 
 Too fancy? 
 No. Too much clothing. 
 There we were, at a real downtown New York party. 
 I was starting to feel like a princess, 
 escaping my life of responsibility in the suburbs. 
 And just like that, 
 prince charming entered into the story. 
 Lady Diana Spencer, I presume? 
 You didn't hear? 
 I'm a princess now. 
 Well, princess, I am the unofficial welcoming committee. Take this. 
 Thanks. 
 And let me guess. You must be Charles Philip Arthur George, Duke of rothesay, prince of wales, and heir to the throne of England. 
 Are you speaking English? 
 Oh. Sorry. Bennet wilcox, anglophile and Stanley kubrick fan. 
 Bennet wilcox? You write the "hot boites" column for "Interview." 
 That impresses you? 
 Most people don't even know how to pronounce "boites"" 
 much less read my column. 
 Not read.  Devour. 
 Your piece on Max's Kansas City's closing night... I've dreamed of being a beastie boy ever since. 
 Well, just wear your hat backwards and say you are. 
 You'll get into any club in this city. 
 Seriously? 
 Velvet ropes disappear. 
 Have you seen Larissa? 
 How are we ever gonna find her in this crowd? 
 I don't think you'll miss her. Make way for the bird of paradise! 
 ♪ Move out 
 make way for the bird of paradise! 
 Larissa! 
 Larissa, over here. 
 Ooh! Joao, Carlos,  e aqui bom. 
 Darling! 
 I'm so glad you came. 
 And who is this beautiful boy? 
 This is my friend Walt. 
 Enchante. 
 I see you've met my Bennet. 
 How are you, darling? 
 Dry. 
 I thought I saw something bubbly and expensive - back that way. 
 She knows me so well. 
 Ciao. 
 Looks like you're in capable hands now. 
 ♪ Been a long time, been a long time now ♪ 
 ♪ I'll get to you somehow 
 He is gorgeous. 
 Dumping me already. 
 He is a triple threat. 
 He is gorgeous, he's talented,  and...  Something else. 
 But then again, isn't gorgeous enough? 
 Well, for me, it is. 
 By the way, I just love your ironic spin on the whole fairy tale princess thing. It's  brilliant. 
 Especially since everyone knows  that  marriage is one of convenience. 
 What do you mean? 
 Oh, you know. 
 Charles only married lady Di because he needed someone royal. 
 But a friend of mine who knows the duchess of Kent... mwah... 
 Who is a bitch... tells me the prince is still hung up on some lady from the horsey set. 
 Camilla Parker... 
 Something-or-other. 
 I saw her picture. Not attractive. 
 I don't get it. That can't be a true story. 
 Charles and di were meant for each other. 
 She's very invested in their romance. 
 But she got her prince. 
 I mean, granted, she was already from the aristocracy, but... still. 
 You're serious. 
 Oh, even better! 
 You're a romantic! 
 It's like finding a unicorn. 
 Come on. I need to show you off. 
 Oh, no. Wait. Almost forgot. 
 Take these. 
 ♪ Move out 
 what are they? 
 Are they required? 
 They are party favors, and yes, they're mandatory. 
 It's ecstasy. The only boring thing about it is it's legal. 
 But don't let that bother you. 
 I'm sure in ten years' time, you'll be arrested for it. 
 I'd come here to escape, 
 but the question was, how far did I wanna go? 
 Hey. What did you do with your pill? 
 I swallowed it. You didn't? 
 No, I threw it on the floor. 
 Okay, great. Now I feel really good about this. 
 What's gonna happen to me? 
 Nothing. You're gonna have fun. That's all. 
 I mean, look at Larissa. 
 Ooh. Your mane is so delicious. 
 Looks like it just made her more happy. 
 You're probably gonna have a better time than me tonight. 
 Maybe I should have taken mine. 
 Would it be weird if I got down on the floor to look for it? 
 Okay. You're making me feel better. 
 Glad to hear it, because this seriously might be the greatest party either you or I 
 are invited to in our entire lives, and I'm only exaggerating just a little. 
 And as we looked around the party, 
 I realized there was only one thing missing 
 for this princess... 
 A really hot guy named Bennet. 
 Hey, why don't we find that "hot boites" guy? 
 What... what's his name? 
 Bennet wilcox, and you totally remember his name. 
 Didn't wanna sound overenthusiastic. 
 Let's go find your prince. 
 That's exactly what I was thinking. 
 Although now that I hear it said aloud, it kinda makes me wanna barf. 
 Mm. 
 Turns out, I wasn't the only one feeling that way. 
 Oh, barf! You wanna go to Sebastian's party? 
 No way. I can't believe you dragged me over here for this. 
 What happened to laying low tonight? 
 Well, I was planning on doing just that until I realized we totally owe it to Carrie to go. 
 Are you sure you're not just looking for something to do because you're bored? 
 Okay, so... maybe I was a little bit bored, but if we have some drinks and some fun, it won't be the end of the world. 
 If the boy who broke my heart were to throw a Halloween party, I'd expect my friends not to go. 
 You're looking at this wrong. 
 If we boycott the party, we won't know what's going on. 
 If something happens with Sebastian, Carrie won't hear about it from us. 
 She'll hear about it from someone else. 
 Is that what you want? 
 I guess you're right. 
 But we're Carrie's best friends. 
 I mean, Sebastian's never gonna let us in. 
 Hi. What's up? I'm glad you guys could make it. 
 Come on in. 
 We're trying to keep the thinking on the Q.T. 
 So the owner doesn't get in trouble, so hard liquor is under booth 4. 
 And the beer and wine coolers are under booth 7. 
 We cool? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 What a jackass. 
 Graffiti is  the  oldest form of protest. 
 The term actually comes from ancient Rome. 
 They used to scrawl it on the colosseum. 
 Think of it as outsider art. 
 It's what gives New York its edge. 
 The spray can just made it easier. 
 And silly me, I always thought it was just vandalism. 
 Seriously, I wish I could draw or vandalize. 
 I don't really have either in me, I guess. 
 It's so... beautiful. 
 He's High, right? 
 A little. 
 I'm jealous. There's nothing better than watching the act of creation while under the influence. 
 So... why don't you tell me a little about you, princess? 
 I stopped to wonder if I should  tell him about the real me. 
 After all, I'd come here to be a princess for the night 
 and escape from real life. 
 That was, until real life came looking for me. 
 Carrie! 
 There you are. I need someone cozy and yummy. 
 It has to be you. Come with me. 
 Have you been dancing? 
 You're totally sweaty. 
 'Cause I'm dewy and filled with life! Whoo! 
 Are you coming or not? 
 Um... I was sort of talking with Bennet. 
 Oh, he won't mind. I'm kind of in the middle of something here, so I'll just come find you in a little while, okay? 
 Fine. I'll be over there, looking for bird seed. 
 Where were we? 
 You were going to tell me a little bit about yourself. 
 Right. Well... there's not much to tell, really. 
 I'm, uh, from Connecticut. 
 I wish I was from someplace glamorous like Charleston or Savannah. 
 Nah. Southerners have no edge. 
 But the accents. 
 You know, charmed, I'm sure. 
 They had segregated buses until, like, a year ago. 
 Is she okay? 
 Aah! 
 Oh. 
 Larissa, are you all right? 
 I'm thirsty, oddly, for water. 
 All right, I should probably get her something to drink, except my friend who I came with is kind of High, and I don't wanna leave him alone. 
 I can keep an eye on him. 
 Are you sure? 
 I-I don't want to impose. 
 It's fine. He'll just stare at the wall, and I'll socialize around him. Pretty low impact. 
 We'll miss you while you're gone. 
 Well, luckily for you, I won't be gone long. 
 Okay. 
 Be back in a jiffy. Come on, lady. 
 Let's get some water. I need it in a baby bottle. 
 What? 
 I'm a baby bird. Feed me. 
 Feed me. Seriously. Feed me. 
 There's... there's no food at this party. 
 Well, then maybe I'll just have another ecstasy. Hmm? 
 Don't you feel wonderful? 
 Not really. Well, those drugs will kick in soon, and then you'll see all the pretty lights. 
 Look! There goes one now. 
 I don't... I don't see anything. 
 Maybe you haven't taken enough. 
 Enough what? 
 Drugs. 
 You... you took more than one pill? 
 Of course. Two ecstasy... Ecstasies? 
 I'm not sure what the proper plural is. 
 And then I drank some champagne, which barely counts. 
 And then I put this little piece of paper on my tongue. 
 What was it? 
 Piece of paper? 
 What... what kind of paper? 
 Like... like tissue paper? 
 Construction paper? 
 Acid paper! 
 You took I.S.D.? 
 Why is it so bloody hot in here? 
 I-I need to keep moving. 
 Seriously, darling, flap your wings and follow me. 
 As I looked around the party, I quickly realized 
 I was on my own. 
 If I didn't help Larissa, no one would. 
 It looked like it was me or nothing. 
 Where are you going? 
 To the roof. 
 Oh, I'm afraid to ask why. 
 To fly. I'm gonna jump off the roof. 
 I can fly! I can be free! 
 All birds must be free. 
 No one... no one can stop a bird. 
 Larissa, don't! 
 No, kids! 
 It's just a costume. 
 I'm not an actual... Oh, wait. 
 You forgot your ca... 
 Candy. 
 Dorrit, those were supposed to be for the trick-or-treaters. 
 Is it my fault you didn't get enough candy for them? 
 You ate it all. 
 You only got two bags, dad. 
 Well... 
 That's true. 
 
 
 
 What are you watching? 
 "Poltergeist." 
 Isn't that kind of a scary movie? 
 I can't tell because you're talking too much. 
 Do you want me to watch it with you? 
 Don't worry about me. 
 Worry about the trick-or-treaters who'll be angry that you ran out of candy. 
 7-year-olds can get really pissed. 
 You should probably turn out the lights so no one thinks we're home. 
 Buh-bye. 
 On Halloween, 
 it turns out the scariest thing  Dorrit could be 
 was a daughter our dad simply could not get through to. 
 Okay, bird, I built your nest. 
 Now you don't have to fly anymore. 
 No more running up to the roof. 
 We're just gonna sleep, right? 
 Oh, this feels so good. I wish I could just lie here forever. 
 So do I. 
 You know that poet who said "no man is an island"? 
 Yeah. John donne. 
 "No man is an island, "entire of itself. 
 "Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main "" 
 yes, yes, that. 
 It's such crap. 
 Clearly he never came to Manhattan. 
 We all live here, millions of us, crammed together, and yet we are all still islands. 
 Totally separate. 
 That's the amazing thing about New York. 
 You all get to be islands here. 
 You make your own lives and take care of yourself, and you don't have to worry about other people. 
 Yeah. We're all islands. 
 Back home, I'm a piece of the continent. 
 And I always have to take care of my family or my friends. It's exhausting. 
 But here you don't have that problem. 
 Here, you get to be fabulous. 
 But it's exhausting being... Fabulous. 
 'Cause you keep looking at what every other little island is doing because you have to keep up, and you keep wondering, is that island over there wearing Norma Kamali? 
 'Cause God forbid you aren't as fabulous as the other islands. 
 Oh. 
 I don't wanna be an island anymore, Carrie. 
 I just want to be a bird. 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 But it wasn't okay. 
 It was like everything that I had admired about the city, 
 that I had admired about Larissa, 
 was making her miserable. 
 Mm. Pet my hair? 
 Please? 
 And even though I was on the island of Manhattan, 
 i'd somehow ended up back on the mainland, 
 taking care of someone. 
 And then there was that time at the Odeon where Janice Dickinson actually put on a saddle, and John belushi rode her around the restaurant like a horse! 
 What?  Wait.  He  rode  her? 
 Wasn't he, like, 500 pounds? 
 How'd he not kill her? 
 This is New York City. Anything can happen here. 
 Fat comedians can ride models, and a quiet kid from St. Louis can find a job where he can eat and drink for free at the hottest nightclubs and restaurants in the city. 
 God, I wish that could be me. 
 It could be. You only live, like, an hour from here, right? 
 I don't know. I mean, I know it's only 60 miles, but sometimes it feels like a million. 
 What are you afraid of? 
 Taking a leap? 
 Seriously, what's the worst thing that could happen? 
 Can you believe the nerve of Sebastian? 
 "Hey, what's up? Glad you guys can make it." Hey, Maggie. 
 It's like he thinks so little of Carrie, he can't even bother to be mean to us. 
 What a jerk. 
 Can we go now? 
 Or we could really stick it to Sebastian by drinking all of his booze. 
 You're always looking for trouble. 
 I am not. I am always looking for fun. 
 Come on. One drink. 
 One. 
 Fine. I'll stay for a minute, but I can promise you that no fun will be had by me at all. 
 Suit yourself. I'll be at booth 4. 
 I can't believe how... 
 Everything is so out in the open in this city. 
 I think it's awesome. 
 Maybe it's 'cause I'm a W.A.S.P., but I'm kind of embarrassed by it. 
 You have to let your W.A.S.P. Go when you live here. 
 In this city, we're packed in so tight, that even your private stuff becomes public. 
 I would hate that. 
 You know, the city is honest. 
 Everything  is  just out there in the open, and because it's out in the open, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. 
 That scares me. 
 Being honest? 
 Maybe. 
 Sometimes it's good to be scared. 
 It means it's real. 
 Maybe. 
 My heart is totally racing right now. 
 Here. Feel. You see? 
 It's, like, going a million miles a minute. 
 Isn't it crazy? 
 It's not crazy. 
 What's wrong? 
 What's wrong? You kissed me. I thought you wanted me to. 
 No. I  didn't. 
 Come on, Walt. Stop. It's no big deal. 
 I'm sorry. I just read the moment wrong. 
 Yeah, I'll say, 'cause I don't like guys. 
 I like girls. I'm not gay or anything. 
 Okay. You're not. 
 But it would be okay if you were. I'm gay. 
 I'm... not. I have a girlfriend who's in Connecticut, and she's waiting for me, which means I can't be gay. 
 Look, Walt... 
 I'm not here to judge or anything. 
 I've totally been there, too. 
 I even had a girlfriend like you. Every... 
 You don't know the first thing about me. 
 I'm not like you at all because I'm not a fag! 
 Shh. 
 Shh. 
 You're a good bird. 
 Such a good bird. 
 I'm a good bird. 
 Yes, you are. 
 Now go to sleep, bird, so the person taking care of you can go back to having fun. 
 'Cause there's a really hot guy I want to get back to. 
 Yeah! 
 Suck on that, blinky! 
 Want company? 
 No! 
 You made me lose. 
 All right, come on. 
 Don't you wonder if you can beat me? 
 Sebastian had awakened 
 something genuinely scary in mouse... 
 Her competitive streak. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah, I'm ready. 
 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000, 3, 1,000, 4, 1,000. 
 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000, 3, 1... 
 Thanks. 
 Damn, you are good. 
 I know. "Pac-man" is my game. Everything's my game. 
 Kind of intense. 
 Of course I'm intense. I have a lot to live up to. 
 Self-imposed, I'm guessing? 
 I'm sorry, but did your parents uproot their entire lives and move to a country where they knew no one and barely spoke the language? 
 Uh... no. We moved here from New Jersey. 
 And did they save every last penny so that they could send you to Harvard? 
 So that pretty much means you have to get into Harvard, or die. 
 My parents are just hoping I don't get expelled from another school. 
 I grind my teeth at night. 
 Sometimes I wake, thinking... What's that noise? 
 And it's me, gnashing my teeth. 
 I sleep like a baby. 
 Sounds like heaven. 
 I wish my parents would spend ten minutes caring about me as much as yours do about you. 
 You seriously don't know what you're asking for. 
 Hey, you're kind of good at listening, you know that? 
 Wouldn't be if you weren't interesting. 
 You wanna know how I deal with tension? 
 That's a joint! 
 I know. 
 But we're in public. 
 Well, it's a private party. I bought the place. 
 Like you buy everything? 
 Can't buy me love. 
 Beatles wrote that. 
 You would if you could. 
 Who wouldn't? 
 You know, I don't really like what you did to my friend. 
 I get it. 
 So... 
 Are you not gonna offer me some of that? 
 You want some? 
 Uh-oh. Copper. 
 What? I just took a hit of pot! 
 Take this. 
 ♪ we're not happy and we're not sad ♪ 
♪ We're not crazy, but we must be mad ♪ 
 I was done with helping Larissa 
 and ready to get back to the party... 
 Which meant this princess was free 
 to find her prince charming once again. 
 Bennet, there you are. 
 Oh. Hi, Carrie. 
 Sorry. It took me forever to deal with Larissa. 
 But I'm glad I could finally find you. 
 So do you have any more of that champagne? 
 It's around here somewhere. 
 Is everything okay? 
 It's about your friend Walt. 
 Yeah. Where is he, anyway? 
 He kind of ran off. 
 Ran off? Where? 
 Out of the loft? 
 Yeah, he left. 
 As in the building? 
 So my friend is High on drugs, wandering the streets alone? 
 Whoa. Look at what we have here. 
 Boys. What do you think you're doing, fags? 
 We're gonna beat your ass, little man. 
 And you won't fight back, will you? 
 'Cause you're homos. 
 You're disgusting. Okay, you're... Hey, stop! Leave them alone! 
 Come on. Come on. 
 That has nothing to do with you. 
 Unless you're one of them. 
 I'm  not. 
 I'm not. Just why do you care? 
 Because they're freaks. 
 You said you'd look after him, so what happened? 
 Did you ditch him? 
 I didn't ditch him. 
 What are you doing? 
 You do realize she's asleep. No, she isn't. 
 Yes, she is. 
 Larissa. Larissa, wake up. 
 I'm a bird. 
 See? She's awake. 
 Okay, well, five minutes ago, she was into it, all right? 
 Hello? Lion, out of bed now. 
 You're molesting someone who's unconscious. 
 She was into it. She kept saying, "touch my Norma Kamali island" 
 and stuff. 
 Mumbling incoherently does not mean she's into it. 
 Okay, well, you're kind of a buzzkill, so I'm gonna head out. 
 What is  wrong  with you people in this city? 
 Is everyone really so selfish that they can't even see anybody else? 
 I mean, look at Larissa. She's passed out. 
 Which is how I left her. 
 I left Larissa here to get groped by someone who looks like they're in the cast of "cats." 
 This... 
 This is my fault. It's not  your  fault. 
 It's a party. You came to have fun. 
 Larissa got herself into this mess. 
 Is that your excuse for leaving Walt? 
 I told you, it wasn't like that. 
 Walt's the one who ran away from  me. 
 Why would he run away from you? 
 We were talking, and then... I don't know. 
 He just ran. 
 I guess I should have ran after him. 
 I thought about it. I just wasn't sure. 
 I made a mistake. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 You're not the only one. 
 I have to go find Walt. 
 I can help. 
 Maybe you should stay here and look after Larissa while I go out and look for Walt. 
 I'm a little afraid to leave her alone again. 
 Sure. Of course. 
 Thanks. 
 And you better not take advantage of her while I'm gone, or I'll come back and seriously hurt you. 
 You hear me? 
 Oh, honey. She's not my type. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, good. 
 I can go... I guess. 
 I guess my prince charming wasn't looking 
 for a princess after all. 
 All right, everyone quiet down. 
 I'm gonna need to see everyone's I.D.S. 
 Look, dude, it's a private party. 
 Yes, with underage drinking. 
 Really? That's how you're gonna play this? 
 Why don't... you give me a minute with officer Bayer? 
 ♪ let's go, let's go Mags... 
 Come on. I get that you don't want me to bust you and your friends, all right? 
 But I am just doing my job. 
 ♪ Let's go, let's go 
 I... can't really do this right now. 
 What do you mean? 
 Come on. You of all people should know this is a really busy night. I can make it busier. 
 Look, with you not dating someone anymore, I just don't know if this is a good idea. 
 Well, it was never a good idea. That's what made it fun. 
 But it... it's just that things are different now. 
 Yeah. Now you can have me anytime you want me. 
 No, Mags, do you know what would happen if people found out about us? 
 Your dad would kill me, for starters. 
 He wouldn't be too happy with me, either. 
 Yeah, but I would lose my job or go to jail. Probably both. 
 I mean, you're in High School. 
 You could get me in a lot of trouble here. 
 And don't you forget it. 
 Mags, I'm just trying to be practical. 
 Practical? 
 Why don't you be practical and get outta here and pretend you never saw anything? 
 I'm a cop. 
 Everybody out there's drinking. 
 You guys are all underage. 
 Didn't stop you from screwing me. 
 Fine. I'll go. 
 Yeah. 
 You will. 
 Aah! Dorrit! God. 
 What are doing? 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm just... 
 Having some trouble falling asleep, that's all. 
 Do you think we could maybe... Hang out a little? 
 Of course. 
 That "poltergeist" movie is terrifying. 
 Yeah. 
 It's okay. 
 We're going to be arrested. We're not gonna be arrested. 
 They'll be able to tell that I have pot in my bloodstream, and now I can never run for senate. 
 By the time you run for senate, smoking pot won't be a big deal. 
 Like that will ever happen. 
 Hey, stop freaking out. 
 I handled it. We're cool. 
 Oh. Thank God. Thanks. 
 No problem. 
 I'm kind of beat. Think I'm gonna head home. You coming? 
 I don't know. Mouse promised me a re-match. 
 I think maybe I'll stay. 
 I'm finally starting to have some fun. 
 Don't worry. I'll take care of her. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Do you have any more of that pot? 
 I'd come to New York to have fun, 
 to put on a princess costume and escape my responsibilities. 
 I realized being a princess wasn't what I wanted to be. 
 I wanted to be a good friend. 
 Are you okay? 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 It's all right, Walt. 
 That party was pretty intense. 
 I thought I wanted to be in this world. 
 But I don't know anymore. 
 What if I can't handle it? 
 You can totally handle this world. 
 You're just a little messed up right now, that's all. 
 I can't believe I'm quoting Nancy Reagan, but tonight a few of you just should have said "no." 
 I'll say. 
 Is Larissa okay? 
 She will be. 
 But I'm exhausted. You wanna go home? 
 Yes. So much. 
 I'll get us a cab. 
 It'll wear off. 
 You know that, right? 
 You took a pill. 
 Whatever you're feeling right now, you're not yourself. 
 But the scariest thing was, 
 for the first time, Walt thought maybe he  was. 
 It had been a rough night. 
 Manhattan had shown me its dark side. 
 But I'd made it through and realized who I was 
 and who I wanted to be... A good friend. 
 It turns out that while I was gone, 
 someone else had been a good friend, too. 
 Sebastian? 
 Hey. 
 I'm really sorry to show up like this. 
 It's just, mouse is kind of a mess. 
 Hi! Carrie! 
 Obviously, I couldn't take her home to her parents. 
 What happened to her? 
 She's... kind of baked. 
 Do you have any chips? 
 I really need something crunchy. 
 Yeah, inside. 
 Don't worry. I got this. 
 Um... she's never been stoned before. Did you know that? 
 I did not. 
 Little late to find that out. 
 Does explain a lot. 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 It's kind of weird that I'm here, isn't it? 
 No. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 I debated whether or not to come. 
 But you had to take care of mouse, right? 
 Yeah, it just would have been wrong to ditch her. 
 Yeah, I totally get it, and I'm glad you brought her here. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 I can take care of her now. 
 Well, uh, I don't wanna be in the way, so... I'll just get going. 
 Hey, Sebastian? 
 Thanks again. 
 Yeah. No  problemo,  Bradshaw. 
 See you around. 
 I realized then that I couldn't demonize him 
 as someone selfish. 
 He did care about other people. 
 The truth was Sebastian and I 
 weren't that far apart, except that now... we were. He's got a really cute  butt! Yes, he does. You've got some serious explaining to do, young lady. Come on. While mouse was about to explain everything... Oh! Walt wasn't going to explain anything. Walt. What are you doing here? Can I come in? Yeah. Is something wrong? ♪ I'm an average man ♪ With an average life Valentine's day is about love. Christmas is about giving. Arbor day is about... Trees, I guess. I get celebrating all those things, but Halloween? Halloween is a holiday where we put on costumes and try on different versions of ourselves... The princess, the demon, the bird flying free. It's fun not to be "us"... ♪ In my average home  and to not have to face the reality of who we really are and the things that scare us... ♪ In the twilight zone ♪ I always feel like ♪ somebody's watching me  like our vulnerabilities... ♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪ when I come home at night  or what we really want for ourselves.

♪ Somebody's watching me being someone else for a night  can be fun... or scary. Either way, it's only one night, and when the masks are off, and we're being ourselves again, we have nothing to hide behind,  and maybe that's okay. But my night in Manhattan had taught me one thing. No matter what you're going through, it's always better if you have  people to share it with. I was lucky. I wasn't an island at all. Seriously, he's got a cute butt. ♪ I always feel like somebody's watching me ♪
