 [ Carrie ] Before there was s*x, before there was the city, there was just me... Carrie. Carrie Bradshaw. And things changing for me in Manhattan... 
 So it's really gonna happen? 
 My purse in "Interview" magazine? 
 Two emaciated models will cling to that bag like their lives depend on it. 
 And for my friends. 
 I-I never had a real girlfriend before you. 
 I didn't know what it meant. But I miss my girlfriend. 
 I'm going to my boyfriend's, where they dress up for dinner. 
 It means we're serious. I keep doing things without thinking how they're gonna affect my future or my... boyfriend. 
 I think you should get out. 
 And with the guys in my life. 
 I like you, Carrie. I want something real. 
 I didn't plan for him to come over. 
 He doesn't have anywhere else to go. 
 No one should be alone on Thanksgiving. 
 [ Blondie's Ream "DG" playing ] 
 Winter in Manhattan 
 can be tough. 
 The last thing you want 
 is to get caught in the cold. 
 Carrie! 
 ♪ 
 That's why it's nice 
 to have a hot boyfriend 
 to keep things warm. 
 ♪ When I met you in the restaurant ♪ 
 Got you a hot chocolate while I waited. 
 Extra whipped cream. 
 Seriously, you're spoiling me. I could've taken the subway. 
 Yeah, but this way, I get to spend more time with you.

 After you.

 ♪ A movie or a measure  George's charm cut

 ♪ And tell you all my dreaming  but as I was getting caught up 
 in my new romance, 
 i was being caught... 
 Literally... by my old one. 
 One foot before the other, Bradshaw. 
 Thanks. I guess I'm no Mary Lou Retton. 
 Don't sweat it. I'm always here to catch your fall. 
 Despite us being old flames, 
 there was still a sizzle 
 between us I couldn't deny. 
 ♪ Pleasure's real or is it fantasy? ♪ 
 It was confusing. 
 If I was with George, 
 why did I feel caught between 
 two guys? 
 [ Laughs ] 
 ♪ People stop and stare at me ♪ we just walk on by ♪ we just keep on dreaming ♪ 
 I figured the way 
 to douse my old flame 
 was to throw myself 
 into this one. 
 I like that this is becoming a tradition... 
 You bringing me to work. 
 You see what happens when you let me spoil you? 
 All the hot chocolate I can drink? 
 I know. 
 Let's play secretary and chairman of the board. 
 That sounds positively dirty. 
 You read my mind. 
 But, George, Bitchy Barbara is gonna be her. 
 Don't tell her I call her that. 
 Your secret's safe. 
 I just... worry that if she sees you here, she'll think of me as some kid... which I am. 
 But still, I want her to see me as a professional, like her. 
 Carrie! I can't believe how late I am! 
 Oh! I had the best night! 
 [ Gasps ] Oh, George. [ Chuckles ] 
 Didn't see you there. 
 Would you mind not telling your father I'm an hour and a half late? 
 Don't worry, Barbara. I'm good with secrets. 
 Bye, ladies. 
 Bye. 
 Bye, George. You, too. 
 Has Harlan been looking for me? 
 He will kill me. 
 Don't worry. 
 When he called, I told him you were in the copy room. 
 He's never been to that floor, so I knew you'd be safe. 
 Oh, God, you're an angel. 
 I feel like an irresponsible schoolgirl. 
 I slept over at Paul's house for the first time. 
 I'm wearing the same clothes from yesterday. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Mouse ] She sounds like a giddy teenager. [ Giggles ] 
 What kind of a loser puts a guy above her career like that? 
 Bitchy Barbara from the sound of it. 
 Well, it's ridiculous. 
 She's, like, really old. Like  40. 
 She should know better than to blow off work for a guy. 
 Barbara's a secretary. 
 It's either answer phones for the rest of her life or straddle some guy in hopes of getting married. 
 I say straddle away. 
 Please, never use the word "straddle" and Bitchy Barbara in the same sentence. 
 Secretary or not, she has responsibilities and those don't include straddling some guy. 
 Again, I beg of you, not that word. 
 It was a little weird. 
 If I'm still dating and talking about guys in my 30s, someone needs to smother me with a pillow. 
 Can one of you be in charge of that? 
 I will. I'll be in charge of that. 
 Please. We'll all be happily married by our 30s. 
 We're already happy now. 
 I know. I can't believe we all have great boyfriends. 
 It's a relationship miracle. 
 It's truly surprising. I always figured I'd be a spinster who lived with Carrie. 
 Hey! 
 Powerful, kick-ass lawyer and doctor spinsters. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I like it. 
 But you like George even more. 
 I don't know why you don't just ask him to the winter dance. 
 It's on Friday. Time's a-tickin'. 
 I don't know. George is older. 
 He might think it's stupid. 
 Which I would normally agree with, but since I'm bringing Seth... 
 And you have to take George, so you can rub that dreamboat in Sebastian's face. 
 You know you want to. 
 Maybe. 
 Is that awful? 
 Well, I would  actually 
 rub his face in it, - so don't look at me. 
 How would you even do that? 
 It kinda makes me think you might still be into Sebastian. 
 I'm not! I promise. 
 And Sebastian's with Donna. I'm with George. 
 Everyone's happy. 
 I knew it! You  do  like him. 
 That's why you didn't tell your Upper East Side lover boy about Sebastian dropping by on Thanksgiving. 
 It never came up. 
 [ Singsongy ] Or it's something you wanted to hide. 
 ♪ 
 Well... I feel bad. 
 Why? You know Sebastian didn't tell his blow-up doll of a girlfriend either. 
 [ Door bells jingle ] 
 Speak of the devil's girlfriend. 
 Carrie! Maggie. 
 Carrie and Maggie's smart friend. 
 Carrie, I just wanted to say thank you for taking in Sebastian for Thanksgiving. 
 Like I was telling the Jens, it was just  so  hard for me to be everywhere at once. 
 So... I'm glad you have less going on. 
 You're welcome? 
 Mm. 
 Um... 
 Sebastian told her. 
 Making me the sad sack who thought it meant more than it did. 
 You would be the opposite of a sad sack if you brought George to the dance. 
 While I was caught up 
 in a drama of my own making, 
 my dad was dealing 
 with own created, 
 surprisingly, by my mother. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Oh, no. 
 What's wrong? 
 Two tickets to "The Nutcracker" 
 for Dorrit and your mom. 
 Oh. I guess mom must've ordered them last year, when she thought she could still go. 
 Yeah. I'd almost forgotten about your mom and Dorrit's little tradition. 
 [ Whispers ] 
 What should I do with these? 
 I don't know. 
 Why don't you take Dorrit? 
 I don't think that's such a good idea. 
 Why not? 
 Mainly because Dorrit would never go for it unless I suddenly become the lead singer of singer of some morose band. 
 [ Clatter ] 
 Why are you guys always such freaks? 
 [ Crunch ] 
 Dorrit, look. 
 Your "Nutcracker" tickets came. 
 Awesome! When are we going? 
 I can't go. It's the same night as the winter dance. 
 Oh. 
 I wonder who could go with me. 
 Maybe Audrey. 
 Or I could take you. 
 Won't it be fun? 
 I guess. 
 Terrific! Yeah, it's a date. 
 Don't call it that. 
 See? It'll be great. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Why do I have the misfortune of having a last name close to yours? 
 I've been stuck next to you for too many years. [ Sighs ] 
 I think the universe is trying to help you. 
 Maybe being near greatness will rub off on you. 
 Hooch. For the dance. 
 Funny, I would've have pegged Walt for a peach schnapps kind of guy. 
 Oh, I can drink a bottle of this by myself. 
 You didn't bring anything for Walt? 
 I brought scotch for my man. 
 Not that it's any of your buisness but Walt's sick. 
 Chicken pox. 
 Oh, so you're not going to the dance? 
 No, I'm going. 
 Really? 
 Isn't it a little tragic to go alone and not have your boyfriend to grind against? 
 No. What's tragic is someone who  can't  be alone. 
 I don't have that problem. 
 Me, either, but I'm  me. 
 I'm always the best thing in the room. 
 Without a hot guy like Walt, you're just positively average. 
 When you see me on the dance floor, you will take that back. 
 [ Laughs ] Oh. That's so pathetic. 
 I can already see you dancing with your sad little girlfriends. 
 I know they won't have dates either. 
 Actually, they do. Hot ones. 
 They both have boyfriends. 
 Good. [ Laughs ] 
 Then I guess that means I won't have to watch Carrie be all mopey while she watches Sebastian and I 
 burn it slow on the dance floor [ laughs ] Bye! 
 See ya at the dance. 
 ♪ 
 This is so cool. 
 So all of these make up the new issue of "Interview"? 
 That's right. 
 I'm just making final approvals before going to press. 
 I wish I could actually see where you come up with all this. 
 I imagine the "Interview" offices are less like work and more like a giant playground. 
 Genius. 
 What? 
 You have just saved me! 
 From what? 
 I've been racking my brain, trying to come up with a theme for my next photo shoot. 
 Christian Lacroix did adult onesies for next season. 
 They're divine, and I can shoot them on an adult-sized playground. 
 The models can have dummies! 
 Oh! [ Laughs ] 
 Dummies? Do... do you mean like mannequins? 
 No. Like those stoppers you put into wailing babies' mouths. 
 Oh. Pacifiers. 
 Exactly. You're  brazilliant. 
 And now for the grand finale... 
 [ Gasps ] 
 No way! My purse! 
 Leaps off the page, doesn't it? 
 Oh! "Painted purse makes a big splash." 
 Eh. Could use some work. Like I said, still approving. 
 Well, what about something more like, um... 
 Uh... 
 "A pollock for your purse... 
 "This fun, splattered look will soon be splattered all over New York City." 
 A pollock reference? 
 That is fabulous. 
 You have got a real knack for this, Carrie Bradshaw. 
 Ya think? 
 Maybe writing is your calling. 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, sure, I like to write, but it's really just a hobby. 
 I'm no Judy Blume. 
 Come and work for me at "Interview." 
 Excuse me? 
 You would fit right in. 
 First, you come up with this brilliant purse, and then spice it up with an equally brilliant caption. 
 You inspired my next photo shoot. 
 You would be fantastic. 
 Oh. 
 Not only was I caught between 
 two guys, but two worlds... 
 The law firm 
 and "Interview" magazine. 
 She offered you an internship at "Interview" magazine? 
 It's kind of a dream, right? 
 Duh! Think of all the parties you'll get to go to and all the celebrities you'll get to meet and all the clothes you'll get to wear. 
 Except... I don't know if I can take the job. 
 What? Are you crazy? 
 You are this close to meeting Ralph Macchio. 
 In case you've forgotten, I'm 16. 
 I have not forgotten. 
 Well, Larissa has no idea. 
 She thinks I'm a grownup who works at a law firm and pays rent. 
 She hasn't figured it out yet. 
 You could pull this off. 
 I thought maybe I could work at "Interview" 
 instead of the law firm the one day a week I go there, but I don't know. 
 I'd feel so awful abandoning that job. 
 Carrie, that internship is a snooze-fest. 
 In fact, I just fell asleep saying that. 
 But my dad got me the job. 
 And he'd be so disappointed if I quit. 
 [ Door bells jingle ] I'm telling you, this will all be forgiven when you meet the karate kid. 
 [ Smack ] 
 [ Bag thuds ] My life is ruined. 
 A B-Plus? 
 In my house, that would get a standing ovation. 
 I've never gotten below an A-Plus. 
 Do you know what happened? 
 Did you study? 
 Of course I studied. I'm always studying. 
 In fact, I studied for this exam all last weekend while I was visiting Seth at school. 
 [ Seth panting ] [ Mouse laughing ] 
 I can't believe it. 
 And to think, I was attacking Bitchy Barbara for letting a man take priority over her job. 
 Meanwhile, I let Seth take priority over mine, which is to get good grades! 
 It makes sense in a way. 
 s*x can make a person do crazy things. 
 I guess you would know. 
 You and Walt have the craziest s*x of anyone. 
 [ Laughs ] Well... 
 Not exactly. 
 Oh, please tell me you do not expect Walt to do it with you when he has the chicken pox. 
 No, of course not. 
 No, even before this, it was just... 
 Well... 
 Less than... happening. 
 We seem to have had a drop-off. Is that normal? 
 Don't ask me. 
 I just destroyed my entire life for s*x. 
 Well, don't ask me. I haven't had it at all. 
 Well, that could change if you take George to the dance. 
 We need to spend less time thinking about guys and focus more on our paths in life. 
 Actually, Carrie might have a new path. 
 Larissa offered her an internship at "Interview" magazine. 
 That madwoman in heels? 
 [ Door bell jingles ] 
 What does your dad have to say about this? 
 Uh, I haven't told him. 
 I'm kind of stalling. 
 Carrie, didn't he get you the job at the law firm? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, my God. 
 My parents would kill me if they got me that, and I bailed on it. 
 Please. Who cares what parents say? 
 I don't, in case you were wondering. 
 And you shouldn't either. 
 So I shouldn't talk to him? 
 No! Just do it. 
 He doesn't know what you do once you're in the city. 
 But I think of my dad as someone I  can  talk to, someone I can trust. 
 I mean, he's not like a friend exactly, but he's certainly more than just a dad. 
 I have no idea what you mean. 
 The only time my dad and I talk is when he says "pass the salt." 
 Carrie, dads are scary. That's their job. 
 Mine is probably going to crush me when he finds out about this grade. 
 [ Sighs ] You're lucky you have the dad you do. 
 Trust me, I know. 
 I'm just saying, at some point, you'll have to make decisions for yourself. 
 Well, something this big, you need to consult a parent. 
 [ Groans ] 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I know that part of growing up is making my own choices, but I also think my dad would have a good perspective on all this. 
 Take the job. 
 Talk you your dad. 
 Now I wasn't just caught 
 between two jobs and two guys, 
 but between 
 two friends' opinions. 
 I wasn't so ready 
 to deal with any of it, 
 except suddenly 
 i had no choice. 
 Hey, comrade. Mind if I fall in? 
 Please do. 
 After all, it doesn't seem anyone minds if we hang out. 
 What do you mean? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 I was just surprised Donna knew about Thanksgiving, and that she seemed so cool about it. 
 I mean, not that there was anything  not  cool about it. 
 Donna didn't have any reason to worry. 
 Uh, it was only Thanksgiving dinner. 
 And since we didn't even have a turkey, there was barely a dinner at all. 
 I told Donna because I didn't want to put you in an awkward position. 
 Awkward? 
 What... what could be awkward? 
 There's nothing awkward. 
 Oh, I just didn't want you to feel like you were part of a lie. 
 You know, with all your friends there, it felt kinda weird. 
 No. No weird at all. There was no weirdness. 
 Donna did actually seem pretty okay with it. 
 With Donna, you never know. 
 You only see what she wants you to see. 
 I wish I could hide what I'm feeling. 
 I just say everything that comes into my head. 
 The words just tumble out like clowns from a clown car. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Look, I'm doing it now. 
 I should probably learn to just keep quiet. 
 No, let the clowns do their thing. 
 I like how everything with you is out in the open. 
 I think it's cute, you spinning out to control, wondering if I'm telling people about Thanksgiving. 
 [ Laughs ] That's me. Just send in the clowns! 
 All right. Well, I'll see you at the dance, all right? 
 You bet you will. 
 I will be there. 
 There was no way I was going 
 to the dance empty-handed, 
 so I decided to fill up my 
 dance card with George Silver. 
 [ Coin clinks ] 
 George, it's me. 
 [ Crickets chirping ] 
 So... I wanted to talk to you about my internship at the law firm. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Did something go wrong at the firm? 
 Well... 
 You know, a lot of work went into getting you this job. 
 We can't mess this up. 
 You are extremely lucky to have it. 
 The firm had never let a high schooler work there before you. 
 And your school wasn't so sure about it either. 
 They weren't? 
 They keep asking how they would know that you were doing the work. 
 You know, worried about how many days of school you'd have to miss. 
 Finally, I was able to get them to agree after everything you'd been through. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I didn't realize. 
 Thanks, dad. 
 Mm. 
 For once, I kept what I was 
 really feeling to myself. 
 That's awesome. 
 And I feel really lucky. 
 I met George as a result, so... that's a huge bonus. 
 Great. That's wonderful, kiddo. 
 So what did you want to talk to me about? 
 Um... 
 I wanted to know how you became a lawyer. 
 Did you ever think of any other careers? 
 No. Never. 
 No, I always wanted to do this. 
 What Harlan does is more corporate. 
 What I do is more person to person. 
 I get to help people. 
 You know, like what I did for your friend Sebastian. 
 Hmm. Right. That. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 And you were right, Carrie. 
 I was very impressed with him at Thanksgiving. 
 He seems like a decent kid. Just made a mistake. 
 He is. 
 [ Sets down glass ] 
 And... that sounds kind of cool, what you do. 
 That you help people. 
 Well, you should come by the office sometime, see me in action. 
 Maybe someday you could, uh, come and work at the practice. 
 No pressure, of course. 
 Kind of feels like pressure, dad. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I just... 
 I think it would be exciting if we both did the same thing. 
 Same thing. That'd be... cool. 
 You got a good head on those shoulders of yours, kiddo. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 Darling! 
 [ Whispers ] Larissa? 
 The law firm gave me your number. 
 Where in the world is 203? 
 [ Lowered voice ] 
 Oh, um, I'm at my dad's. 
 Why on earth? 
 You're a grown woman. 
 Um, I'm playing nurse for the night. 
 Uh, my dad seems kind of flu-y. 
 Uh, you wouldn't wanna know the details. 
 Well, it's Monday. I need an answer about the internship. 
 Larissa, today is Thursday. 
 Oh, is it? 
 [ Scoffs and laughs ] Silly me. 
 Well, then I'll talk to you Monday, and your, uh, answer better be "yes."

 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 You sure you're okay not having a date for the dance tonight? 
 If you want, you can come with me and George. 
 Or me and Seth. 
 Nah, I'm kind of excited about going stag. 
 I will take a ride, though. 
 What do say you and me get all dolled up at your house, Mouse? 
 Sure. 
 Seth is coming ready 7:00, so maybe be there around 6:45. 
 Hello?! How long do you think getting dolled up takes? 
 I will be there at 5:00. 
 Mrs. Holzman! 
 Mrs. Holzman, wait! 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Uh-oh. This is about that exam grade. 
 [ Mouse ] Mrs. Holzman! Mrs. Holzman! 
 You said we could talk after school. 
 I'd almost forgotten. 
 It's about my poor exam grade... The B-Plus. 
 A B-Plus is hardly a poor grade. 
 Harvard, Yale, and Princeton admissions would all beg to differ. 
 Isn't there anything I can do? 
 Besides study harder next time? 
 Please! Maybe a retest? 
 Some extra credit? Anything. 
 Fine. I'll give you an extra credit assignment. 
 But I want it in my office on my desk by 8:00 P.M. tonight. 
 I'm chaperoning the dance, so I'll leave my door open until then. 
 Thank you! Thank you! 
 Thank you! 
 
 
 
 This is even longer than the exam. I'll never finish it by 8:00. 
 The more you talk, the less gets done. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Come in. 
 You look great, sweetie. 
 Thanks. 
 Um, uh, this came for you. 
 I think it must be from the law firm. 
 Oh, you must be making quite an impression for them to be sending you things at home.

 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You obviously wanted me to see you dancing with him. 
 No, what I wanted is to dance with my boyfriend. 
 I just find it surprising you never mentioned him. 
 Why? I don't think who I'm dating is any of your business. 
 You're with Donna, and I'm cool with that. 
 I don't stare at you. 
 It's like you were trying to distract me on purpose. 
 I think you might need to ask yourself, Bradshaw, if you're so into this guy, why were you paying so much attention to me? 
 I'm happy with George, okay? 
 And I won't let you ruin that. 
 So please, leave me alone.

 Dorrit... 
 I've been looking everywhere for you. 
 What is wrong? 
 How could you fall asleep like that? 
 I-I don't know. I just... I... 
 [ Sighs ] I drifted off. 
 I didn't even want to come with you tonight. 
 I knew something like this would happen. 
 I knew you wouldn't get it. You never get  anything. 
 Dorrit, I came here to try. 
 To try to get to understand what it is that you want, what you're interested in. 
 Yeah, snoring next to me really proved that. 
 [ Sighs ] I did not come here for the dancing snowflakes, Dorrit. 
 I came here to be with  you. 
 Maybe I dozed off because I've been working for three nights straight on one of the biggest cases of my life so I could take tonight off to take you to this. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Well, you're a teenager. You're not supposed to. 
 [ Exhales deeply ] 
 I don't know how to talk to you. 
 What do you mean? 
 I feel weird when we're, like, alone together. 
 I was only ever alone with mom. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 That's crazy. 
 What about when we would go out for pizza after soccer? 
 You do realize that was Carrie. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Carrie has you. 
 And I had mom. 
 Which means I don't have anyone anymore. 
 Dorrit, do you really believe that? 
 Well, it's just not true. 
 Of course you have me. 
 And you are not alone. 
 I'm cool with being alone. 
 Who wants to offer an explanation? 
 Miss, if I may? 
 There are only two reasons students break into classrooms... 
 To steal tests or have s*x. 
 Mrs. Holzman, I promise I was only trying to turn in my extra credit. 
 Scout's honor. 
 Well, strangely, I believe you. 
 You're my only student who's more concerned with her grades than... well, anything. 
 Does that mean you'll take my extra credit? 
 No. It just means you get the benefit of the doubt. 
 You'll have to keep the B-Plus. 
 You were late turning in the assignment. 
 But I worked so hard on it. 
 You might wanna minimize your losses and just be happy you aren't being sent to the principal. 
 [ Exhales deeply ] 
 [ Clink ] 
 [ Car door unlocks ] 
 This will never happen again. 
 Until it does. 
 You don't believe me?

 [ Continues crunching ] 
 Wow. 
 Looks like you were still having fun even without Walt here. 
 [ Sighs ] What are you talking about? 
 The hot cop. 
 Yeah. That's someone who works for my dad. 
 And is part of his job description screwing his boss' daughter? 
 Wonder if that hunk in uniform would enjoy jail. 
 Talk of the town, I'm guessing. 
 Go away, Donna. 
 This is none of your business. 
 Except you made it my business. 
 And your friends are always in my business anyway, so I guess it all evens out. 
 What friends are you talking about? 
 The little one. 
 She's so small, yet such a big pest. 
 Wow. 
 You must be threatened. 
 I'm just protecting what's mine and making sure that you help me. 
 Like I would ever help you. 
 If you don't want people finding out, including your boyfriend, you will keep Carrie away from Sebastian. 
 How in the world am I supposed to do that? 
 You'll figure out a way, or your secret gets out. 
 You don't have to do this, you know. 
 Carrie's totally into her new guy. 
 ♪ 
 I'm so glad you thought of this. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 We should do it more often. 
 In the limo or in general or just, like... 
 We'll talk about it later. 
 George, isn't there a chauffer or something in the front seat? 
 He's used to this sort of thing. 
 Um, George, just give me a second, okay? 
 I'd gotten so caught up 
 in trying to prove a point 
 to Sebastian, 
 I was now caught in a situation 
 I wasn't ready for. 
 George, I'm not sure I can... 
 Oh, sure you can. I have faith in you. 
 George, I'm not having s*x with you, okay? 
 Not with some stranger in the front seat and a seat belt jabbing me in the back. 
 You dragged me out here. 
 Well, I know, but... 
 Is this your thing? 
 You dangle it in front of a guy and then don't give it up? 
 I don't have a "thing." 
 I'm a virgin. 
 Oh. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Yeah. So you see how that changes things. 
 Sure. 
 Look, I know most guys hate that, but I'm totally cool with it. 
 Like, I like the idea that I'd be your first. 
 [ Scoffs ] I'm sorry, but it's not something for you to be "cool with" or not. 
 It's about me and what I want. 
 But I don't see why the virgin thing has to be a big deal. 
 Your virginity is just something you get out of the way so you can start having fun. 
 Well, I don't see it that way at all. 
 s*x means more to me than that. 
 I don't want to lose my virginity in the back of a car with some guy who's pressuring me. 
 I wanna lose it to someone who thinks its special, someone who thinks  I'm  special. 
 You're right. 
 Sometimes I forget you're younger than me. 
 I love that you're a romantic. 
 And your first time should be special. 
 So... 
 aybe you just take care of me? 
 [ Scoffs ] Okay, I should probably go. 
 Go where? 
 Back to the gym. 
 And you should go back to Manhattan. 
 I-I'm breaking up with you. 
 [ Scoffs ] Are you kidding? 
 Do you know how good you've got it? 
 Yes, I do, and that's why I'm saying good-bye to you, George. 
 What? All right, well, good luck getting home. 
 [ Slams door ] 
 [ Engine starts ] 
 Suddenly I wasn't caught 
 between two guys at all. 
 I was now by myself, 
 caht in a web of my own making. 
 Thanks for walking home with me. 
 I can't find Mouse or Seth anywhere. 
 Well, my ride drove off in a cloud of dust, - so you're doing better than me. 
 Wow, you must be so crushed. 
 Are you sure there's no way you could get back with George? 
 Wait. You think I made a mistake? 
 You don't think I should've slept with him, do you? 
 I don't know, Carrie. 
 Maybe how and where you lose your virginity doesn't... 
 Really matter in the big scheme of things. 
 Doesn't it mean more to lose your virginity to someone you really love? 
 Like you did with Walt? 
 I guess I actually deserve the B-Plus. 
 Not because I didn't turn in the assignment on time, but... 
 Because I've been letting our relationship get in the way of my schoolwork. 
 So... 
 I wasn't gonna say anything, but... 
 My grades have been suffering, too. 
 Really? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I was afraid you might look down on me or think I couldn't hack it. 
 [ Laughing ] 
 I guess neither of us could hack it. 
 We can't do this, Seth. 
 I know. We have to study more when we're together. 
 It's more than just that. 
 We're not people who get B-Pluses. 
 We're people who get A-Pluses. 
 We can't hold each other back from that, no matter how much we'd like to be together. 
 Are you breaking up with me? 
 Seth, look at us! 
 We're people who know exactly what we want and what it takes to get there. 
 Getting good grades and staying on path is who we are. 
 But maybe there's a way around it. 
 You know, what if we made a kind of contract? 
 You know, set aside "X" number of hours? 
 This isn't who I really am. It's gotten out of control. 
 I almost got suspended. 
 I see your point. 
 [ Kisses ] 
 Mouse knew 
 in order for her and Seth 
 to be who they truly were, 
 they would need to let go 
 of each other. 
 I can't believe you've been carrying all this around for so long. 
 So you don't hate me? 
 Sweetie, I'm not here to judge you. 
 But I do feel awful for Walt. 
 I mean, you cheated on him. 
 I know. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Obviously, something deeper is going on for you. 
 What is it? 
 I don't know. I... 
 I mean, I love Walt despite what I've done. But it just... 
 It feels like something isn't working between us. 
 I can't quite put my finger on it, but it feels like it's me. 
 You can't beat yourself up. 
 But I do think you and Walt need to deal with this. 
 Talk to each other. 
 What if he never speaks to me again? 
 I guess I deserve that. 
 He needs to hear it from you, not Donna. 
 Oh, yeah. You're right. 
 On the brighside, Sebastian must really like you. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Donna's like a cornered cat. 
 Ah, who knows? 
 That Sebastian's a tricky one. 
 And I don't want to get caught up in all the drama. 
 I've created enough of my own. 
 [ Exhales ] 
 Maybe we should just forget about boys. 
 Ha! Totally. 
 But even in other parts of my life, I can't escape it. 
 I feel like I've created this whole fantasy inside my head about how I could work at "Interview." 
 Ohh. I mean, what was I thinking? 
 I-I can't leave the law firm. 
 My dad would be crushed. 
 But you really want "Interview." 
 Don't lose this chance. You'll totally regret it. 
 And trust me, regret's no fun. 
 I'll walk you home.
