 Before there was s*x Before there was the city, there was just me, Carrie Carrie Bradshaw from Castlebury, Connecticut. 
 I love you. 
 There are so many soirees now in the city. 
 I know. 
 Do you? How's my article coming? Actually, I decided not to finish the piece. 
 You know what? I just don't think it's gonna happen for you right now, but be a love and go make me a cappuccino. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Maggie, I'm engaged. 
 What am I gonna do? We'll figure out what your choices are together. 
 It appears your daughter has an ectopic pregnancy. 
 You are a lowlife, getting my daughter pregnant, - putting her life at risk. 
 Why didn't you tell Maggie's parents that you're not the father? She wouldn't want her parents, especially her dad to know she was involved with Simon. 
 Do you not understand what people will think of you? The only thing I care about is that you know the truth. 
 Originally Aired December 20, 2013 The holiday season is a time to be grateful I was feeling cold and tired to give thanks Yeah, kinda sad and uninspired and this year, I was thankful for so much. 
 I'm so lucky. 
 I love you. 
 It was a time for second chances. 
 The Grace and feel the magic in your touch oh, lay your hands Lay your hands on me lay your hands ooh, ooh, ooh lay your hands but not everyone in Castlebury was in the holiday spirit. 
 I knew this was a bad idea. 
 I shouldn't have come back to school. 
 Should've just told everyone I was sick - forever. 
 You have nothing to be ashamed of. 
 You were out with a burst appendix. 
 At least that's what I've been telling everyone. 
 Thanks, Carrie. 
 But you know, half the town knows that I was pregnant, and the other half thinks that I was out because you beat me up to get your boyfriend back. 
 People just love a juicy story so they don't have to think about their own boring lives. 
 They'll forget about it in a week when something else comes up. 
 I don't know. 
 I have a terrible poker face. 
 It's gonna be hard to hide that this is one of the worst of my life. 
 Whoo-hoo! Harvard! I just got in! Early admissions. 
 This is the greatest day of my life. 
 Yeah, I kick ass. 
 Um, did you guys just hear me? I got into Harvard in Cambridge? - Congrats, Mouse. 
 That's great, Mouse. 
 Great. 
 That's better. 
 Except Walt's not here. 
 Way to ruin a perfect moment. 
 Where the hell is he, anyway? What's going on? I've packed some things for you. 
 You told dad. 
 It's something he should know about his son. 
 Where is he? He doesn't want to see you. 
 Can we please talk about this? Do you have any idea what you've put us through? Don't make this any harder than it already is, Walter. 
 My parents kicked me out. 
 Hey, dad. 
 Hi. 
 I have something kinda major to ask you. 
 More major than when you asked me to live in New York last summer? Well, oddly enough, it involves the person I was living with in New York last summer Walt. 
 Um you know he would never be interested in me, right? Uh Well, yeah. 
 Yeah, I mean, I-I, um, I probably wouldn't have let you live with him if I hadn't known that Walt was Not interested in in you or others like you. 
 Well, he's in trouble. 
 You see, his parents found out that he's not interested in people like me, and they kicked him out. 
 Is he doing all right? Not really. 
 Would you be? His own mother packed all his stuff. 
 What kind of mother does that? Well, I was hoping he could stay with us. 
 Is that okay? Uh, well Carrie, look, I know that Walt is your friend, but I'm not so sure that we should be getting involved in someone else's family problems. 
 You know, dad, you're the last person I expected to have an issue with this, and another thing it's not someone else. 
 It's Walt one of my best friends who you've known practically his whole life. 
 Is it because he's gay? Because I would hate to think that's why. 
 I'll admit that it makes me a little uncomfortable. 
 I mean, I'm not sure I even know someone who's gay. 
 Well, you know Walt. 
 You know what? Forget I even asked or that I told my friend he could rely on me. 
 I'm sure he'll be fine living in his car. 
 Carrie, stop. 
 You're right. 
 Of course he can stay. 
 Really? Thanks, dad. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks again, Mr. 
 Bradshaw, for letting me stay. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 No, I want you to make yourself at home and enjoy your gay. 
 I mean your stay. 
 I should Go and, uh, finish up some stuff. 
 Your dad doesn't exactly seem comfortable having me here. 
 No, he's fine. 
 'Cause I really don't want to impose. 
 You're not imposing. 
 Um, hello? That's easy for you to say. 
 You're not the one being made homeless in all this. 
 You're not homeless, Dorrit. 
 Walt's the one who's homeless. 
 So how come I'm being punished by getting kicked out of my room? I don't have to stay in your room. 
 Ugh. 
 Then your crap will be all over the den. 
 It's fine you're in my room. 
 Are those clothes dirty? 'Cause I could wash 'em for you. 
 I like my clothes like this. 
 Are you sure Walt's okay? I tried inviting him to come stay with me in the city, but he said no. 
 Should I be worried? I think he just wants to keep his life as normal as possible right now. 
 So he's staying in school and crashing with us. 
 Well, I'm glad he's at least with people who care about him. 
 Honestly, I think he just doesn't wanna seem like a mooch. 
 Fantastic. 
 I'll see you there. 
 Guess who's gonna be a sexy elf? I just booked a job as one of Santa's little helpers at a party for Bongo Jeans. 
 I thought I told you, you can't use the phones here for personal calls. 
 Since when are you such a goody-goody? It's making my daily hangouts here so much less fun. 
 You know it's not mandatory that you come here. 
 And I'm not being a goody-goody. 
 I just wanna stop being Larissa's cappuccino-making monkey and get her back to thinking of me as a potential writer. 
 Members of the "Interview" -igentisia, in my office now. 
 I just came back from my fall holiday Uh, um what's it called? Thanksgiving? The one with the Turkey? Yes. 
 Anyway, I spent the whole time on the untamed frontier of this beautiful country, experiencing your wild, wild west in the town of Aspen. 
 I've seen America and it is Denim. 
 It's all about Americana now, darlings. 
 I want stories on the frontier. 
 I want stories about cowboys. 
 I want stories about blue jeans. 
 Go. 
 And, Janet, bring me a cappuccino. 
 Did you see that? What? The ho-ho-hoedown that is now Larissa? Well, that, and she didn't ask me for a cappuccino. 
 Poor Janet. 
 You know what that means, don't you? It means you're out of the doghouse. 
 You can pitch stories again. 
 If I wanna get back in her good graces, as well as published, all I have to do is find a great Americana story. 
 I think I have another shot at a piece in the magazine if I can pitch the perfect Americana story to Larissa, and I think I found one. 
 Bongo Jeans. 
 Bongo Jeans? Really? Yeah. 
 Uh, it's an American brand. 
 It's denim. 
 I mean, they're literally creating a new niche in fashion hip jeans. 
 So it would combine Larissa's two favorite things commerce and fashion. 
 If it came with a drink, Larissa would marry it. 
 Sounds pretty cool. 
 Yeah, and it gets better. 
 Samantha is working the Bongo Jeans Holiday Party, so she can sneak me in. 
 Not exactly sure how. 
 We haven't quite figured that out yet. 
 And then I need to think of a way to introduce myself to the C. 
 E. 
 O. 
 Carter something or other. 
 Carter Richman. 
 Yeah. 
 How'd you know? - Because I know him. 
 What? He's an old golf buddy of my dad's. 
 We get invited to all his parties. 
 I know for a fact that my dad already R. 
 S. 
 V. 
 P. 
 'd "Yes. 
 " So let me take you. 
 No need to go in the side door. 
 Wait. 
 So does this mean I'm actually going to meet your dad? That's a big deal. 
 Or not. 
 He never really shows up to these things. 
 Even though he R. 
 S. 
 V. 
 P. 
 'd, I think he's still in Laguna, which, trust me, is for the best. 
 You don't want my dad around if you're trying to get an Interview. 
 But still, I'd be excited to meet him. 
 Some other time. 
 The Bongo party will be about you getting your story. 
 You sure? I'm gonna make this happen for you. 
 It looked like my second chance with Sebastian would be my second chance with "Interview. 
 " I love this tradition you and me, holiday shopping, the smell of Christmas in the air. 
 Oh. 
 And too much perfume. 
 I'm happy to have you back, Mags. 
 I'm happy to be back and to start over with you. 
 Yeah. 
 Clean slate. 
 Oh. 
 Hello. 
 How are you? She's fine. 
 Great, actually, no thanks to you. 
 Hi, girls. 
 I think we met before. 
 Yeah. 
 Hi. 
 You're Maggie, right? The chief's daughter. 
 Your dad would not believe what a softie Simon is when it comes to Christmas shopping. 
 He actually got my mom an engraved picture frame. 
 How sweet is that? That's adorable. 
 Well, we should be going. 
 These these presents aren't gonna buy themselves. 
 Okay. 
 Bye, girls. 
 Good luck. 
 Are you okay? - Yeah. 
 I hate that he gets to me. 
 Well, you almost died because of him. 
 Yeah, and I'm sure he knows. 
 My blabbermouth brother Joey tells him everything. 
 They're best buds. 
 I can't believe he never even checked in on me. 
 Simon is not a good person. 
 I don't care how many picture frames he buys. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 It still kills me to see him with her. 
 They're gonna have babies together. 
 After what I went through, I don't know if I can have them, ever. 
 You have to tell your dad it was Simon. 
 No, I'm scared to. 
 He's already so disappointed in me for getting pregnant. 
 If I told him I seduced one of his officers, it'd be even worse. 
 You didn't seduce anyone. 
 You're a teenager. 
 Simon's an adult. 
 He's the bad guy here, which is ironic since he's a cop and is supposed to protect people, not hurt them. 
 You have to tell your dad, Mags. 
 This will always haunt you if you don't. 
 While Maggie debated whether to give her father some upsetting news Mouse was still trying to figure out how to deliver her good news to West. 
 Hey! - Welcome back! Great news! Really? So you heard? We won regionals. 
 That's terrific! Any other good news? Well, this is my third time winning regional championship, so I feel like I don't need anything more than that. 
 Maybe any college news? Is there something wrong, Mouse? What's going on? No. 
 No, it's just I got into Harvard. 
 Oh! That's amazing. 
 I was waiting here for you because I was hoping you were gonna tell me that you got in, too, - so that we could celebrate together. 
 Absolutely. 
 So you did get in? No, I didn't get in. 
 Oh. 
 Maybe your mom got the letter today, and it's waiting for you at home right now. 
 Mouse, listen to me. 
 I didn't get in. 
 But that's not gonna stop us from celebrating your victory. 
 Are you sure? Are you okay? I'm fine. 
 Let's focus on you. 
 This is your dream come true. 
 Yes, it is. 
 But I don't wanna rub it in your face. 
 I-I feel awful. 
 Don't. 
 I'm so proud of you. 
 You're an amazing man! Trust me, this piece about Bongo is the biggest thing that's going to happen to denim since the California gold rush. 
 I'm listening. 
 Sort of. 
 What I'm hearing right now is you have ideas but not a plan. 
 Can you actually get to this man? My Interview with Carter Richman is already scheduled in his calendar. 
 It's on the books, set in stone. 
 Good. 
 Because if you drop the story again like you did with Weaver, you're done at "Interview. 
 " I give second chances, but not third ones. 
 Got it. 
 Way to go, Carrie. 
 I didn't know you scheduled an Interview with the C. 
 E. 
 O. 
 I didn't. 
 I totally lied. 
 But I am going to go to this party and figure out a way to get to him, and if I fail, then I guess my career at "Interview" is over. 
 Go big or go home? - Exactly. 
 That sounds stressful. 
 Yeah. 
 You think? So how about you? Any plans for tonight? No. 
 Well, you wanna come to the city with me and Sebastian? No. 
 Thanks. 
 I think I've done enough Bradshaw intruding for one lifetime. 
 You're not intruding. 
 You are a welcome guest, and I know Dorrit hasn't been the nicest, but I love that Dorrit's being so rude. 
 It's Dorrit being Dorrit. 
 She's treating me like she always treated me, and that makes me feel normal. 
 She's the one person not making me feel like I'm walking around on tiptoes in this house. 
 Hey! I'm not. 
 Well, that's Sebastian. 
 You sure you don't wanna come with us? At least to the city. 
 I mean, we can drop you off at Bennet's. 
 And sit cramped in the back of that Porsche? No. 
 I'm good here. 
 I just wanna lay low and watch some TV. 
 Okay. 
 Have fun. 
 Hey, you. 
 I am so excited to chase down this Interview with you at my side. 
 You're like my guy Friday. 
 I'm excited you're excited. 
 And, uh, I have some good news and some bad news. 
 I called Carter's office and told them that I'm coming to the party and that I'm bringing a journalist from "Interview" who's interested in talking to him. 
 Is that the bad news? Please tell me that's the bad news, because that's awesome bad news. 
 My dad is gonna be there. 
 Okay. 
 And I didn't exactly tell him we would be there. 
 So I have no idea how he's gonna react or I can guess he might react kinda badly, w-which means That this night might be an absolute disaster where you and your dad come to blows, and my chance at a story goes down the drain. 
 It'll be okay. 
 Okay. 
 "Bah, humbug," no, that's too strong And if my dad's drinking scotch, - he may get cranky. 
 - Okay. 
 And there may be bimbos. 
 All right. 
 And snide comments. 
 Okay, now you're starting to scare me. 
 Scared is good. 
 Scared is prepared. 
 The only thing I wanna be prepared for is my interview. 
 Ski shoppin' Oh, look, there's Samantha. 
 Had his number but never the time And there's my dad. 
 Looks like he's already made a friend. 
 Well, I'm just happy it's not Samantha. 
 That I am definitely not prepared for. 
 I don't want you to worry about anything but your article. 
 Okay? In terms of my dad, I got this. 
 But I wanna make a good impression. 
 You're not the one I'm worried about. 
 And here comes my dad. 
 I wasn't expecting to see you here tonight. 
 And you're smart not to drink the scotch. 
 It tastes like warm cat urine. 
 And who's this? Uh, Mr. 
 Kydd, I'm Carrie Bradshaw. 
 My girlfriend, dad. 
 Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas But they've decided to try and work things out, so they're going to Hawaii - Hey, Walt. 
 Hey, Mr. 
 Bradshaw. 
 Do you want the TV? No. 
 No, no. 
 I just, uh I just wanted to make sure everything was good with you. 
 You, uh, settling in okay? Yeah. 
 Great. 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 Very good. 
 It's just, it's Saturday night. 
 I mean, wouldn't you Rather be out with your friends? No. 
 I don't mind staying in. 
 I brought over some episodes I taped of my new favorite show, "The Golden Girls. 
 " Ooh. 
 Sounds interesting. 
 Just who are these golden girls? They're just four ladies who live in Miami together. 
 And solve crimes? With a 14-year-old in the house. 
 Actually they sort of just sit around eating cheesecake, talking about their lives. 
 It's really funny. 
 There's the ditzy one, the fun one, the wise one, and the really old one. 
 Uh Four women who sit around talking about their lives? That's a TV show? I don't see it lasting. 
 You're probably right, but I like it. 
 What ever would we do with him - for two weeks? - Do you wanna watch with me? There's plenty of things to do down here. 
 Uh sure. 
 We can take him to Disney world, the Seaquarium, the Everglades Rambo. 
 Rambo? The movie With Sly Stallone. 
 I sat through it twice. 
 You'll love it. 
 He sweats like a pig, and he doesn't put a shirt on. 
 Mouse, I can feel your eyes boring through the menu. 
 I just hope you're okay About not getting into Harvard. 
 Why are you whispering? I don't want anyone to overhear. 
 It's no one's business. 
 You should be able to tell people in your own way when you're ready. 
 I don't have a terminal illness, Mouse. 
 It's just a college. 
 A university. 
 The most prestigious in this country. 
 And I know it has to bother you that I got in and you didn't. 
 Mouse, I don't really wanna talk about this anymore. 
 Okay? - Okay, I get it. 
 I just don't want you to give up. 
 There's still regular admission. 
 It's not over for you yet. 
 Maybe I could talk to someone now that I'm in. 
 I didn't get into Harvard because I didn't apply early. 
 What? Why? Because last year, that girl from Harvard told us they would probably only accept one student from Castlebury. 
 And if I had applied, I would have been the one accepted, not you. 
 That's not true. 
 Please. 
 We have the same grades, same extracurricular. 
 And then I'm an athlete, I letter in three sports, have a single mom and a brother in a wheelchair. 
 It would have been me. 
 And since I love you and I know that Harvard is your lifelong dream, I bowed out. 
 So call off the pity party. 
 You're welcome. 
 While Mouse was learning a hard truth, so was Maggie's father. 
 I just didn't want you thinking that Sebastian was the father. 
 It wouldn't be right. 
 I can't imagine what you must think of me. 
 Daddy, please! I could kill him. 
 Did you say "him"? What kind of sicko preys on a teenager? You're not mad at me? No, I'm angry at the b*st*rd And at myself. 
 This is my fault. 
 I-I'm your father. 
 I'm supposed to be protecting you, not leaving you vulnerable. 
 Don't blame yourself, daddy. 
 I'm sorry this happened to you. 
 Come here, come here. 
 Oh, my little girl. 
 I can't believe you got to fly in the concorde. I've always wanted to do that. Do they really give you your own eyeshades and slippers? 
 That they do. Now that plane may be fast, but it is not comfortable. The seats are tiny. 
 But you get there in, what, five hours? 
 Mm. 
 Hopefully someday I get to fly in it, who knows? 
 Maybe for a story. 
 
 
 
 She's a real go-getter you've got here, Sebastian. 
 Maybe she'll rub off on you, huh? Yeah, maybe. 
 So Sebastian tells me that you're looking to get an Interview with Carter tonight. 
 Well, I-I was hoping I could, - but I know it might - Let me get you a personal introduction. 
 Really? That would be amazing, Mr. 
 Kydd. 
 Oh, it's not a problem. 
 And please, call me Garrett. 
 Now where is that son of a bitch? Guess who just got bango-ed in her Bongos? And in Santa's house no less. 
 What? With who? Let me see, what was his name? Chris Caleb? Carter! Carter! Oh, no. 
 This could be bad. 
 - Garrett, you old dog. 
 Hey. 
 Look, I want to introduce you. 
 This is please say she's not your new girlfriend. 
 She's a little young - Even for you. 
 No, don't be ridiculous. 
 This is my son's girl. 
 Come on. 
 They're still in high school. 
 You remember Sebastian. 
 Of course. 
 And how do you all know Samantha? - Don't worry. 
 They don't know me the way you know me. 
 And Carrie's one of my girls. 
 I call her "Bambi. 
 " Carter, I wanted to introduce you to Carrie Bradshaw. 
 You see - Wait, Carrie Bradshaw? - You're the "Interview" reporter? - Yes. 
 Well, I-I - Hang on, I thought I was being interviewed by a real journalist, not a high school student who hangs out with hostesses. 
 I have investors to think about, and who I give access to matters. 
 Second chance? More like fat chance. 
 This is a disaster. 
 I should just leave. 
 Look, he's distracted. 
 I can make a break for it. 
 Carrie calm down. 
 You can handle this. 
 Can I? You heard him. 
 He thinks I'm just a high school student, not someone to take seriously. 
 I'm pretty sure when I was dragging you off, I heard him call me "Bambi. 
 " Oh, he probably heard Samantha call you that. 
 This just keeps getting worse. 
 Carrie, I've known Carter all my life. 
 He's a good guy much more of a good guy than my dad is. 
 And you managed to charm the hell out of Garret. 
 Go talk to him. 
 You're prepared. 
 He'll see that and be impressed. 
 This is much different than winning over your dad. 
 I'm great with parents. 
 I'm untested in the department of heads of major fashion companies Especially ones who think I'm best friends with Trampy the Christmas elf. 
 Don't worry about Samantha. 
 You are gonna kill this. 
 He thinks I'm just a kid. 
 You know Carter was 19 when he started this company? I know. 
 I did my research. 
 Exactly. 
 So you know you can do this. 
 This is your second chance - And my last. 
 If I blow this, it's over for me at the magazine. 
 Carrie, I get it. 
 Going after what you want is scary And possibly heart-breaking. 
 But if you don't go for it, you'll have nothing but regrets. 
 And I know that's not you. 
 This is your chance. 
 You have to take it. 
 You're right. 
 Thanks. 
 Love, love, love, love, love one another That Sophia is too much. 
 She is my favorite. 
 And although Rose Oh! With all the St. 
 Olaf stuff? - Oh, God. 
 She's pretty great, too. 
 Ohh. 
 Now I-is it weird that I kind of feel like I'm Dorothy? I-I think everyone feels that way because she's kind of the every woman. 
 Oh, God. 
 Now I'm an every woman. 
 Sorry, I meant No, no, I know what you meant. 
 I know what you meant. 
 Uh, play the next episode. 
 That's it. 
 We watched all the ones I taped before I Left. 
 Well Walt, that was a lot of fun. 
 I haven't laughed like that in a long time. 
 Thanks for watching with me. 
 I had more fun than I ever had with my own dad. 
 Well, I should, uh, get some sleep. 
 This early? It's, like, 9:30. 
 Aren't you kids usually just heading out for the night at this hour? Well, the thing is I don't want to go out. 
 I'm kind of afraid to. 
 Why? I guess seeing my parents' faces and what they thought of me Made me feel bad about who I am and what I'm doing. 
 So maybe if I just don't do it, they won't hate me so much. 
 You're not doing anything wrong. 
 And you're not a bad person. 
 You just don't like girls. 
 To my parents, that's the same thing. 
 That is their issue, not yours. 
 But I'm such a disappointment. 
 No. 
 Look, we we all want things to be easy for our kids, or at least not hard. 
 And you being Gay. 
 Yeah. 
 You being gay may make your life harder. 
 But your parents shouldn't be a part of what makes that hard. 
 Mr. 
 Richman? I know I didn't make the greatest first impression and that I'm young, but so were you when you first started selling jeans on the streets of Miami. 
 You had a passion and an idea and you went for it. 
 And that's what I'm doing. 
 So I hope you'll give me a shot. 
 Comes down rain What you got for me, kid? Well, I wanted to start by asking you what was your inspiration for Hey, can I get a Martini, up? Thank you. 
 You can't run for cover From the looks of it, she's charming the hell out of Carter. 
 Well, good for her. 
 You haven't had the most stable of upbringings. 
 I always had food on the table. 
 Look, what I'm saying is I screwed up a lot. 
 I know that. 
 But here you are, maybe finally getting your act together with a a great girlfriend. 
 And I can't take an ounce of credit for that. 
 That is all you, kid. 
 I mean thanks. 
 So maybe it's not too late for us. 
 Think you can give your old dad a second chance? That'd be great. 
 We'll spend Christmas in Laguna at the new beach house, spend some real time together. 
 I'd love that. 
 Sebastian and I were both learning that things can turn around if you give them a second chance. 
 And then there are those whose luck has finally run out. 
 You can't be serious. 
 You're firing me? Son, shut your mouth. 
 I know a man your age has trouble seeing the world as it is and where he fits in it. 
 So let me make this simple for you. 
 She's 17 years old, a minor, and my daughter. 
 You realize how - But she Damn lucky you are to still be drawing breath? You hand in your badge and gun, and do everything you can to make sure I never see your face again. 
 Get out. 
 I'm so excited and nervous. 
 I stayed up late and finished my article so my dad could drop it on his way to work. 
 Am I crazy, or are things finally looking up - for all of us? - Oh, you're crazy. 
 But then again, aren't we all? - Pretty much. 
 Where is she?! Where is she?! You little bitch! Oh, my God, this isn't happening. 
 It's okay. 
 We're here. 
 How could you do this to me? Your dad fired me, and I got dumped all because you're just a little slut who was asking for it! Don't you dare. 
 You better get outta here. 
 You're lucky you're not in jail. 
 What, let me guess, you told your little whore of a friend that she should tell her daddy on me. 
 Was this your idea? Don't get near them. 
 What are you gonna do about it? Whoa. 
 Pretty boy thinks he can take me. 
 Oh! No, stop! Stop it, you guys! Stop! Stop it! Sebastian, stop! Oh! You know the kind of hell you put us through, you selfish b*st*rd? Stop it. 
 I took the fall for this. 
 Oh! - Hey, break it up! - Whoa. 
 Whoa. 
 Stop! Stop! Stop. 
 Calm down, okay? Not the best news. 
 I've been expelled. 
 What? I don't get it. 
 Simon came here and started the fight. 
 Everyone saw that. 
 Yeah, well, with my record, I guess this was the last straw. 
 My dad is gonna kill me. 
 No he's not. 
 He's you're right. 
 He's gonna kill you. 
 So the principal calls me. 
 This is unbelievable. 
 This is unacceptable! Look, dad, I'm sorry. 
 I I-I - You're sorry? What are you sorry for? You're the only one making any sense around here. 
 Some scum cop harasses a 17-year-old girl, and nobody does anything about it except you. 
 You stepped up, did the right thing. 
 I'm really glad you feel that way, dad. 
 Really glad. 
 I bet you're proud to be with a man who knows how to stand up for what's right. 
 I am very. 
 You know, I have always hated these uptight, stuck up Connecticut types. 
 It was your mother who made us move here, you know? But now we can get out of this town for good. 
 What do you mean? I mean, I've been wanting to move to Laguna full-time. 
 The only thing stopping me was you being in school. 
 But now that that's apparently done, we can move to California. 
 Yeah, I don't know, dad. 
 What do you mean, you don't know? Come on. 
 There's surf, there's sunshine, convertibles Carrie can come visit. 
 It's a done deal, Sebastian. 
 You're coming. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Can I sit down? Sure. 
 I just wanted to apologize. 
 Really, I couldn't be happier that you got into Harvard. 
 And I never meant for you to know that I didn't apply so that you can get in. 
 And yet you told me. 
 You were just so patronizing. 
 You were making all these sad clucking noises and and acting like you were better than me. 
 When clearly you think you're better than me and more qualified. 
 I guess I just didn't care about Harvard as much as you do. 
 I'm not even sure it's my first choice, so I thought I'd give it to you. 
 See even saying it that way If you weren't even sure it was your first choice, then why didn't you just tell me that That you decided not to apply early Instead of making me feel like you gave me Harvard? Because I did. 
 Well, the fact that you felt I wouldn't be able to get in on my own only makes me think you don't think very highly of me. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I'm just tired of your obsessiveness. 
 It's in everything you do. 
 Homecoming, our relationship, getting into Harvard it's just too much. 
 You used to think my determination was cute. 
 Do you not love me anymore? Maybe I'm just exhausted from your endless need for competition and I just don't care about Harvard as much as you do. 
 But you know I do. 
 And now you've tainted that, because now I'll always wonder if I got in for the wrong reasons. 
 I'm sorry, Mouse. 
 Me, too. 
 I guess I should - Go? Yeah, I think you should. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 You, too. 
 How can I do this when we're finally back together? How can I move across the country now? How can you not? Things are finally good between you and your dad. 
 That's what you've always wanted. 
 But I also want you more than anything. 
 We'll work it out. 
 It's the modern age. 
 There are phones and airplanes. 
 We can write love letters to each other. 
 It'll be romantic. 
 I'll be, like, your Elizabeth Barrett Browning. 
 Don't know who that is, but I like how you're thinking. 
 We can make long distance work. 
 Of course we can. 
 I'll fly back all the time. 
 I'll fly back so much, you'll get sick of me. 
 You'll be thankful to ship me back to a house 3,000 Miles away. 
 I doubt that. 
 When's your flight? In a few hours. 
 Listen I refuse to say "Good-bye," because it's not good-bye. 
 So let's just say something casual, like "See ya," or "Later, dude. 
 " I don't think I can call you "Dude" with a straight face. 
 Well, then, how about "Adios, chiquita"? Mm. 
 I like my first idea best "See ya. 
 " It's poetic in its simplicity. 
 See ya, Bradshaw. 
 See ya, Kydd. 
 Dorrit, can you pass me some more tinsel, please? You're, like, two steps away. 
 Get it yourself. 
 Walt You now have an official Bradshaw stocking. 
 Lucky you. 
 Now Santa can bring you a useless collection of ballpoint pens And batteries. 
 Hey, batteries are very useful. 
 Just what everyone wants in a gift. 
 Mr. 
 Bradshaw Carrie Dorrit, um, you guys have made me feel like a real part of the family. 
 And I don't know how I can ever thank you. 
 I know how you can thank me. 
 You can go out and get some cheesecake. 
 That stupid show you were watching has made me think of nothing else. 
 I would love some cheesecake, too. 
 Uh, okay. 
 I can run to the grocery and see what they have. 
 No, I'm not talking about Castlebury Cheesecake. 
 I'm thinking about real New York Cheesecake. 
 You know, from Junior's. 
 Maybe you could head into the city and pick one up? - Now? - Sure. 
 Don't you know someone in Manhattan someone who maybe would love spending the holidays with you? Maybe your friend could go to Junior's with you, and if you don't happen to pick up the cheesecake, well, you know that's okay, too. 
 Yeah, I can make a trip into the city right now. 
 You bet! Oh, jingle bells Thanks, Mr. 
 Bradshaw. 
 Jingle all the way Mm. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas, Walt. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 I know you were just trying to get him to see his boyfriend, but he'd better still bring back cheesecake. 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas In "A Christmas Carol," scrooge has given up hope for happiness, for love, for good cheer. 
 But despite his lack of belief, he's given a second chance A do-over to change how he views the world. 
 Will be out of sight Most of us aren't visited by different versions of ourselves so we can see the mistakes we've made. 
 But if we're lucky, we can seize the chance to make the changes and make things better.
