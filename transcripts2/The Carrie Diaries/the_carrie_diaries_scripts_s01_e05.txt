 Before there was s*x, before there was the city, there was just me--Carrie. Carrie Bradshaw. It's 1984. Ronald Reagan and shoulder pads were all the rage. I'm trying to figure out who I am with the help of my family, my best friends, a sexy new guy, and a hot, new city. Figuring out who I was and finding my voice wasn't going to be easy, but I was pretty sure it was going to be a lot of fun. Some things come with a territory-- Being bored out of your mind while filing-- Well, that's obvious... While other moments might surprise you. 
 Oh. Sorry. Are you all right? 
 Oh! Oh, I am so sorry. 
 Yeah. It was my fault. Sorry. 
 Ow. Uh... 
 ow. 
 Meeting a cute guy at your internship-- 
 Well, that's not something that happens every day. 
 I'm George. 
 Yeah. I'm... klutzy. Sorry. 
 Think you're selling yourself a bit short. 
 And short. 
 Petite. 
 You're charming. 
 So, klutzy, do you have a first name or last? 
 I have both. Carrie Bradshaw. 
 Well, now I'm just insulted. 
 I don't understand. 
 You don't remember me? 
 Have we met? 
 I came out to your house. You did? 
 Yeah, I was about 7, and you were 4. 
 And I rubbed poison Ivy all over us. 
 George Silver. Yeah, you're Harlan Silver's son. 
 I have never forgotten you, mostly because I had to take oatmeal baths for a week, and I almost scratched my face off. 
 And I never left the city again. 
 Well, excluding Europe, the Hamptons, and Mustique. 
 You're kind of pretentious. 
 Nobody ever tells me the truth. 
 Well, they should. 
 Um, I should get going. My... Boss is coming, and, well, she doesn't exactly... 
 George. Barbara. 
 You didn't have to come to the office. 
 I could've had your dad's driver drop your applications off. 
 But how could I have brought you these? 
 Barbara was kind enough to have typed up my college applications for me. 
 Well... I should... 
 get going. Yes, you should. 
 Hold on, Barbara. How am I supposed to ask her to my mom's next big soiree if she isn't here to be asked? 
 ♪ I can't get to sleep ♪ I think about the implications ♪ 
 Why would you say no? 
 Obviously, he's hideous. 
 He's not hideous. Fat? 
 No, he's adorable. 
 ♪ Especially at night ♪ 
 So a... cute rich guy who is taking a gap year between high school and college invited you to a fancy upper east side party, and you said no? 
 Is something wrong with you? 
 Is it because he's dumb? 
 Why else would someone take a gap year? 
 Isn't that just code for too dumb OR too lazy to get into college? 
 Not a reason to say no. 
 Adorable and rich trumps stupid and lazy any day. 
 He's not dumb or lazy. 
 A little entitled, but I don't even think that's his fault. 
 George's parents are kinda strange. 
 His mom's name is Kick. Who's named Kick? 
 Again, not a reason to say no. 
 She's right. 
 Just... really busy right now, you know, with school, my internship, studying for my driver's tests. 
 Got a lot going on. 
 Are you expecting us to believe that? 
 Studying for my driver's test is intense. 
 George would be a distraction. 
 It's Sebastian. 
 Does that make me a loser? 
 No. Yes. 
 I know we're not together, But halloween just made me think maybe there was still a chance. 
 I think he still likes you. 
 Why else would he be so nice to me when I got so stoned? 
 Because you're awesome. 
 And he got you stoned in the first place. 
 Well, I think you should hold out hope. 
 I did, and now Seth and I 
 are back together. 
 Except you haven't sealed the deal since your un-breakup. 
 You need to get him in the Sack and tie this thing up. 
 Wow. You are mixing your metaphors. 
 We haven't been alone with each other since we got back together. 
 What about your lovey-dovey reunion in Manhattan? 
 They walked around. 
 Eating ice cream. 
 Look, guys don't care where they are. 
 They always want it. Are you sure the s*x is good? 
 I don't know. I-I think so. 
 Although he did break up pretty much right after we had s*x. 
 Oh, god, that's bad, right? 
 Maybe. 
 Now that Walt and I have done it, he can't get enough. 
 That's what happens when it's good. 
 Last night, he flipped my legs-- 
 Stop. 
 No details. 
 We're very happy you guys are back together, but I think it might be better if we don't have any visuals. 
 Yes, Walt and I are back together, and you know why? 
 Because I moved on, and he could sense it. 
 That's the only way to make a guy interested-- 
 is to make yourself unavailable. 
 That's what you should do with Sebastian. 
 But I don't wanna play games with Sebastian. 
 Mm. Then I hope you're willing to lose. 
 While I defended my precarious position... 
 ♪ it's just overkill  my dad was finding himself in a difficult position 
 of his own. 
 ♪ Fade away ♪ 
 Excuse me. 
 Hello? 
 Harlan. 
 Are you still at the gym? 
 Uh, long time gone, my friend. 
 On to new games. What's up? 
 Can't find my wedding ring. 
 I, uh, I-I put it in my gym bag for our squash game, and now I can't find it. 
 Well, did you call over there? 
 Maybe that hot girl Misty could look for it. 
 She knows her way around the men's locker room. 
 I lost my wedding ring, and you're making lewd jokes. 
 I'm sorry, Tom. I'm just trying to make you laugh. 
 Why'd I take it off? 
 I think the better question is, why do you still have it on? 
 Because I love my wife. 
 Well, and ring and no ring doesn't change that. 
 Maybe it's a good thing. 
 That I lost the most important symbol of my marriage-- 
 How is that a good thing? 
 Would you ever have stopped wearing it on your own? 
 It's brutal, Tom. 
 But Grace wouldn't have wanted you to stand still and not move on. 
 You don't know what Grace would have wanted. 
 She was my wife. 
 I'd better go. Uh, maybe it's in the car. 
 So my parents are leaving for the weekend at, like, 5:00, but don't come before 8:00. 
 I'm afraid my parents have drafted our neighbors... 
 the alexanders, to spy on me. 
 So I'll need the cover of darkness. 
 And I'll park on the other side of the street three houses down. 
 I'm excited to see you. I can't believe it's been three weeks. 
 And almost two months since... 
 We did it. 
 Has it been that long? 
 I know. 
 You must be dying for it. 
 No, it's cool. s*x isn't everything. 
 With Maggie's words ringing in her ear, 
 mouse couldn't help but wonder if Seth meant s*x with her. 
 The next day, I was conquering New territory... 
 and passing my driver's test with flying colors. 
 So the last part of the physical driving test is the parallel parking move. 
 You must place the car between the marked cones. 
 I don't want to brag, but I'm gonna nail this. 
 If you thought I did a good job on the 3-Point turn, you ain't seen nothing yet. Mm. 
 Prepare to watch magic. 
 Really? 
 What the... 
 is something the matter? 
 Are you gonna parallel park or not? 
 Oh! Ho ho! 
 Aah! 
 Oh, my... god! 
 Oops. 
 Bradshaw? 
 Girl, what the hell are you doing? 
 I thought I hit the brakes. Oh! 
 She tried to kill us. She tried to run us over. 
 You okay? 
 What happened? 
 I told you to watch out for that blind spot. I don't know. 
 The problem wasn't the car's blind spot... But my own. 
 We should check the car for damage. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, there doesn't seem to be any... 
 why don't you head to the car, and I'll be right there? 
 Damage to the car. 
 But I... 
 no, just head to the car. 
 Well, that's a relief. Well, obviously you failed. 
 I know. I don't-- 
 I don't know what happened. 
 You can't lose your focus, Carrie, ever, no matter what's going on. 
 Will you ask the lady if I can retake the test and when? 
 Excuse me. Uh-Huh? 
 Um... 
 I... did not want you to find out this way. 
 Find out what? 
 About me and Donna. 
 There's a you and Donna? 
 We've been... hanging out. 
 Since when? 
 It's been a week or so. 
 Oh. Seems like it's going very well from what I could see. 
 If I'd known you were here, I wouldn't have-- 
 Had your tongue down her throat? 
 Don't feel like you have to hide anything from me. 
 I mean, why would I care? 
 I just thought it'd be uncool for you to have it thrown in your face. 
 Why? 
 It's cool. I'm cool. 
 It's been weeks. 
 Weeks. Of course you've moved on. 
 Actually, it would have been totally pathetic if you hadn't. 
 I would have felt bad for you because I've been hanging out with someone else, too. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's... great. 
 His name is George Silver. He's from the city, as in Manhattan. 
 His mom's name's Kick. Uh... 
 Now if you'll excuse me, I... I should go call him. 
 Hi, George. It's Carrie. 
 I can go to the party after all. 
 ♪ why can't we get together? 
 You can't wear that one. 
 Oh, hi. I'm trying to find something to wear on my date with George for his mom's party, and I'm on my lunch break. 
 I know. And Kick prefers the term "Soiree." 
 Oh. Soiree. Got it. 
 I've never been to a party like this. 
 Kinda nervous. 
 I'm supposed to wear blue. 
 Sapphire. This is navy blue. 
 Is there a difference? 
 In Kick Silver's world, there is. 
 Let me help you. 
 It's called the jewel party. 
 It's one of the most talked-About events of the social season. 
 Each woman is assigned a color-- 
 Either Ruby, Emerald, or sapphire, and the Kick wears white And covers herself in rubies, emeralds, and sapphires. 
 Wow. George didn't tell me. He just said "Blue." 
 Well, that's my George-- 
 Like most men, not one to focus on the fine points. 
 When Harlan and Kick were still married, I had to deal with every last idiotic detail that pretentious socialite thought of. 
 Her wish, my nightmare. 
 One year she wanted swans. 
 They pooped all over her oriental rug, and they're mean sons of bitches. 
 Try these on. Thanks. 
 So you've known George a long time. 
 Since he was 4. 
 Poor kid. He may summer in Ibiza, but he does not have parents who know the first thing about priorities. 
 He is the rope in their obscene tug-of-war. 
 That sounds awful. 
 So what do you think? 
 That looks nice on you. 
 Shows off your eyes. 
 Thanks. 
 And I think... 
 I still have some fake jewelry from last year. 
 They gave it out as party favors-- 
 Rings, a few necklaces. You can have them. 
 It'll give it a little... Sparkle. 
 Thank you. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Maybe. 
 Why are you being so nice to me? 
 Well, I mean, not nice, but... 
 Yeah, okay, nice. 
 I think it's good for George to hang out with someone who knows the value of hard work. 
 You think I'm a hard worker? 
 I have to say, I was pretty sure you were just gonna be the entitled kid of one of Harlan's friends, but you have surprised me. 
 Maybe even impressed you? 
 Don't push it. 
 It appeared Barbara and I 
 had entered new territory, and it was nice. I can't believe Sebastian is dating Donna. I really thought he was better than that. What does he even see in her? Um, her big boobs and her hot body. Men do like that. Maybe that's why Seth isn't excited about me. I don't have one of those. I mean, I have two boobs, just not a hot body. Well, some of us love our girlfriends for their personalities. You don't think I have a hot body? You think Seth isn't attracted to me? Maybe I should just not talk. I'm just glad Carrie's at her internship and has other stuff going on, like her date with George. As long as ding dong Donna doesn't rub it in her face, she'll be fine. What are they doing here? They never come here. The diner is  ours. Oh. Hey, guys. Is Carrie not here today because of me? I mean, me and Sebastian. She's obviously having a hard time dealing with the new "It" couple. I heard she tried to run them over, right? She did not. And Carrie isn't here because she's too busy having an awesome time in manhattan and can't be bothered hanging out with losers at the diner. Us excluded, of course. This place is so cute. I don't know why we don't hang out here more. Because This is  ourhangout. I don't think you can claim a place. That's just childish. It's ours, and we're not going anywhere. Actually, I have to get back for calculus. And I've got european history. Okay, go. I have study hall. And I'm not leaving. While Maggie was protecting our territory, my dad was protecting his. The jeweler looked at me like I was crazy. Well, you are, Tommy. You lost the ring. Move on. You know what else he said? Buy a woman something sparkly, and you'll get laid? No. He told me that Grace lost her ring three times. I guess she was always taking it off to garden. I-I never knew that. What, that she gardened? Are you being purposefully obtuse? That she lost her ring. It should make you feel better. I guess. You know what should also make you feel better? My son is gonna be wining and dining your daughter. Oh, George better not be wining her. She's 16. You don't have to worry. Despite having me and that crazy bitch of an ex-Wife for parents, George is a great kid. Doesn't matter how great George is. It's just... weird thinking of my little girl dating. Yeah. Well, I get it. I wouldn't want girls, knowing what Horn dogs teenage boys are. Yeah, you're not helping. Once again. Can I ask you something? Sure. Where did you learn about s*x? Our Fifth Grade health education class. I also learned that I would get hair under my arms. I was traumatized. No, I mean, like... how to have s*x. Oh. Kinda still learning. Why, did Maggie say something? Am I bad? No. She said you were good. Really? That's cool. 'Cause I've been trying really hard to do it right. It's kind of exhausting. Is it supposed to be? I'm very confused. I think I'm doing a bad job with Seth. The thing is with guys, we're kinda happy with anything, as long as it's being, you know... handled. That's the thing. I never know what to do with... it. You play golf, right? Yeah. My parents make me. Well, you know how you're supposed to hold the club loose but with control? I never can do that. I always wanna, like, squeeze it really tight. I've given myself blisters. Yeah, okay, that's not good. Oh, my god. I'm bad at this. Really bad. I need help. Help me, Walt. I might have something for you. Meet me at your house after school? Yeah. Okay. See you then. That night, when my father got off the train, he was distracted by his missing wedding ring... aah! Oh! Really distracted. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you sure? Ooh. Yeah. Oh, I am so sorry. It's okay. No, it's not. I hit you with my car. It's... I think it's--It's... Yeah, let's go sit down. Okay. Oh, here. Let me take your bag. Please. God. Well? You look good. Maybe too many necklaces, but... what do I know? I like it like this. It looks nice. Now... If you get nervous or run out of stuff to say, just tell Kick that the canapes are divine and that the basquiat in the great room is so much more spectacular than the one in Pat Buckley's penthouse, and she will love you. Okay. I have no idea what you're talking about. Are those people? Canape is an hors d'oeuvre. A Basquiat's a painting. Oh, boy. Now I'm officially nervous. Don't be. Wow. You look amazing. So do you. Why are you in a tuxedo? Because tonight is formal. I thought it was cocktail. It was cocktail last year. Yeah, but you know my mother. She likes to up the ante. This year--Formal. Did I not say that? No. No. You didn't. I can't go like this. Why? You look beautiful. Because I know how these things work. If I show up in this dress, I will forever be known as the girl who came to Kick Silver's soiree in a knee-length dress. What are we gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. Um... if you'll excuse me, I-I need a couple minutes. Don't know how you managed that, Carrie. Well, it's a good thing Barbara's daughter went through a tutu phase. This way. 
 
 I don't think we're in castlebury anymore, toto. Oh, and look, there's the great and powerful Oz. The best thing to do when entering unknown territory? Georgie. Kick. Mwah. Mwah. And I see you brought your friend. Smile. So glad you could make it. Your dress is fabulous. Is it Couture? Haute Couture? I, uh... the dress was designed just for Carrie. Oh! So it is. Yes. Your home is beautiful. Oh, I'm glad you think so. George says the artwork is frightening. Kick, you had Edvard Munch's "the scream" in my bedroom. The pastel version, but we sold it when George's psychoanalyst said it might be the cause of his nightmares. I don't think you needed to share that with her. I was 10. I hope you don't mind. I invited Blythe. I didn't realize she was back. Back and more gorgeous than ever. She looks positively radiant after her little vacation. Blythe is my ex-Girlfriend, and she's just back from rehab. Oh, look, there she is now. Suddenly, I realized I wasn't in foreign territory. I was on somebody else's. Meanwhile, mouse and Walt were in unchartered territory. While in this position, the male participant Should scissor his legs in order to increase the friction. I don't understand what I'm even looking at. Yeah. It took me five viewings to get my bearings. That's her knees. Is that actually physically possible? I've perfected it. Whoa. No wonder Maggie thinks you're so good. I hope Seth will think that of me. He will. At first, things with Maggie weren't going so well, but then I got this video, and I have one satisfied customer on my hands. It'll work, I promise. I hope so. Seth arrives in less than an hour. I have a lot to Cram in before he gets here. You'll be great. Even though mouse had a lot of ground to cover, she was sure she could maintain her overachiever status when it came to s*x. Meanwhile, Maggie realized there was simply too much ground to cover. I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Eating. Salads. With the dressing on the side. I was sitting here five minutes ago. Were you? You threw my purse and coat on the floor. Oh. Didn't realize they were yours. Why don't you go back to the mall where you belong? I'm bored with the mall, but you know what I'm not bored with? Is Sebastian. And my man loves the grilled cheese, so we're gonna be hanging here a lot. Listen up. You and your gruesome twosome are not taking the diner. The diner's ours. Or maybe you and your friends should find somewhere else to have your lame little convos. I don't think you know who you're dealing with. I have two older brothers, and I'm not afraid to bite. So if you'll just get up and leave quietly, we can end this right here. Make me. I told my father I'm not going if we don't fly privately. I don't care if it takes a few hours longer. I don't want to have to sit with the masses. I wouldn't go anyway. The weather at thanksgiving in gstaad can be so iffy. Sometimes there's not even snow. Why do you even care? You don't ski. But I love to  apres-Ski. So, Blythe, how was your stint in Rehab? George, that's very uncouth for you to ask that in public. But I'd be happy to give you the details if you wanna go somewhere private. Well, I'm not sure Carrie wants to hear all about your most recent stay at Betty Ford. I'm sorry. I'd forgotten she was even here. She hasn't said a word. I didn't think you'd be all that interested in my trip to the D.M.V. Oh. D.M.V.? Is that near the D.R., the dominican republic? I think I'm supposed to go there next week. Uh, the department of motor vehicles, in connecticut. It's the place where you get your driver's license. Oh. I don't drive. None of us do. You don't have to in the city. Seriously? Driving is awesome. You get to have total control over your life and go where you wanna go and listen to the radio really loud. That's why we have drivers. Oh. Well, you're missing out. Well, I would love to learn how to drive, but only if you teach me. I think that can be arranged. Now that would be fun. What's wrong, Kick? I need you. The French ambassador and secretary Kissinger are about to come to blows over whether or not... Iranian caviar should still be allowed to be imported. Well, I'm sure you put your 2 cents in already. I would, except the ambassador's english is terrible and, well, your French is flawless. Can you help me? Go ahead. I can handle myself here. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Mm-Hmm. Darling, you're sweet. Charming even. But at some point, George is going to get tired of slumming and come back to me. I don't know who you think you are or who I am, but I'm from the suburbs. That doesn't make me a loser. It just makes me not from here. Now if you'll excuse me... oh! Great. Hello? Okay, you sound super excited. I thought you were Seth. Oh! I'm interrupting. He's not here yet. I'm nervous. Don't be. It's gonna be great. Seth is a lucky guy. Okay, why are you calling? I thought you were supposed to be at Kick's fabulous soiree? I am. I'm hiding in the powder room. That's what rich socialites call the bathroom. There's a phone in the bathroom? Why? So they can talk to the help while they pee? Gross. I feel like I'm totally in a foreign land and I definitely don't speak the language. George calls his mother by Her first name. Okay, that is just weird. So George isn't your guy. That's the thing. I thought he could be. I actually had a moment tonight where I thought, hello, George. Good-Bye, Sebastian. And then I met his mom. Who cares what his mom's like? You're not dating her. Yeah, tell that to Kick. And to  Blythe. Wait. Who's Blythe? His gorgeous, long-Legged, shiny-Haired ex-Girlfriend. I never felt more itty-Bitty suburban in my entire life. Enough! No one in the real world likes jewel-themed parties or leggy beauties. Okay,  maybeguys like that, but not as much as being cool and smart and pretty. And George invited you to this party, not lithe Blythe. You're right. I'm always right. Seth's here. Oh! So if you'll excuse me, I need to go jump my boyfriend, and I suggest you do the same. Go get him, tiger. Aah! Mouse was hopeful her new bag of tricks would do the trick. ♪ Beautiful girl, lovely dress ♪ 
♪ high school smiles, oh, yes ♪ 
♪ beautiful girl, lovely dress ♪ meanwhile, across town, somebody was using some old tricks. Oh! Oh! Oh! What are you do--Get out! ♪ Gone, daddy, gone, your love is gone ♪ 
♪ Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone, your love is gone ♪ Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone ♪ your love is gone away ♪ 
♪ When I see you ♪ 
♪ a thousand eyes turning blue ♪ 
♪ 'cause it's gone, daddy, gone ♪ Gone, daddy, gone, your love is gone away ♪ And while one friend was about to admit defeat, another was claiming victory. Mouse... Wow! Have I said "wow"? About ten times. That last move? I-I-I didn't even know it was possible. Expect the impossible when you're with me. I have to say I'm--I'm surprised but I'm also a little relieved. Was s*x that bad with me before? No, no, no. It was good. But this... I mean,  this... clearly, you've learned from someone. Mm. Well, to be honest... you don't have to explain. I-- You had s*x with another guy. And it--It's okay. I-I feel less guilty. I was feeling really bad because I had s*x while we were broken up, too. You did? Well, we both did. Yeah. What a relief. Well, uh... now neither of us have to feel bad we slept with another person. Okay, good, 'cause I just was feeling really awful that I slept with other people. People? I thought we were talking singular. Two. Uh, we--We were broken up, after all. Georgie, what are you thinking? Obviously not what you're thinking, Kick. She didn't know what Couture was. You loved her dress, so what's the difference? I blame this on myself. It's because I married your father-- A jew from the bronx. I thought it would be exciting to leave my circle, but... it's not. It's just hard. He never understood our world, what we wanted. And now I'm in the middle of a hideous divorce with an ass of an ex-husband who doesn't understand how it works. Save yourself the trouble. Maybe you're right-- if that's what you think, then she definitely is. Thanks for the canapes. Carrie, wait! Let her go. It's for the best. For who? For you? I'm going after her. George, you're not leaving yet, are you? We haven't even had a moment to talk. Not now, Blythe. Carrie, wait! Damn, you can run in heels. Carrie, stop. Why? So I can hear from your mouth how I don't fit into your world and how I embarrassed you? Or are you worried the bumpkin from Castlebury can't get herself home without a limo? Well, don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. And I know you can. That's why I like you, Carrie. I don't understand. And had you waited, I was about to tell my mom that yeah, maybe she's right, that it's Harder. But I don't care. I want sometimes real. Why, when you can just have it easy with your cars and your drivers and your basquiat? Which, by the way, isn't spectacular. It's scary. I know, right? I don't get this world. And I live in it, but sometimes as I'm sitting at these events, listening to everyone chattering on about nothing, I look around and I think, how did I get here? I just wanna move past my life where it is now and find something new. Does that make any sense? That's when I realized we were both so in our own world, we hadn't noticed we were standing on common ground. It does. Often that ground felt a little shaky, but it was really nice to share those fears with someone else. I could've taken a cab. You did not have to drive me home from the train station. Oh, well, it's the least I could do after hitting you with my car. So this is your home. Actually, I live in the city. I'm just visiting my mom for the weekend. Oh. That gives me hope. I have a feeling that my oldest is gonna wind up in manhattan, and, uh, I hope she wants to come back and visit me. I didn't realize you had kids. Two girls. So you're married? Uh, no. No, not anymore. Maybe we should exchange numbers. So you can track me down if you need to Sue me? Or so you could ask me out on a date. Oh. Even though My dad wasn't ready to date... he now knew he was ready to move on. I knocked you on your ass. That's because you have a really  bigbutt. Admit defeat. I'm happy to leave this table but I'm not leaving this diner. Why? So you can torture Carrie? You already got the guy. Isn't that enough? Not for me. Well, what do you want? World domination? It's a diner. Hi. What's going on here? Uh, nothing. I saved you a seat. Hope you're happy. About what? Like you don't know. The diner. This is  ourplace. We've been coming here since we were kids. This is Carrie's safe place. I didn't know. She sure did. Uh, wait. Just give us a second, okay? What are you doing? What? I like their grilled cheese. You're better than this. Am I? You don't have to do this. I like you, not because you're a bitch. In spite of it. You like me? Nobody's ever called me a bitch before. At least to my face. I like it. So can we get out of here? The place is all yours. Thanks. Maggie might've won our territory, but she realized I had lost the war. You wanna go again? I guess. We don't have to. Because you don't think I'm good? Huh? Because of that other guy, now you don't think I'm good. I didn't say that. You think he's better than me. Why? Is it 'cause he's taller than me? He couldn't be. I'm--I'm tall. And I'm in college. Is he? Does he go to your high school? He's just a regular person. I thought you said you didn't care I was with someone. Wait, are you still with him? You're still with him, aren't you? Okay, Seth, maybe this has gone too far. I... I-- I can't believe you slept with someone else. Why? You did. Yeah, but it's different. Really? Why? Because I'm a guy. All right, Buster, this is such a ridiculous double standard. So if you sleep with a bunch of girls, you're cool. But if I do, I'm a slut? Yes, I slept with someone else, and it was great and he taught me lots and lots of stuff. And you just better deal with it. I can't, mouse. Okay? I-I can't. I'm just... jealous, okay? So I-I can't take it. I--So just... tell me his name, okay? If you don't, I'm just gonna die of jealousy. Okay. fine. If I tell you his name, will you just stop? I need to know you're going to calm down. Yes. I-I promise. Just... tell me. The guy who taught me all this, his name's... Walt. Okay, can we just end this now? If I ever meet this Walt, I'm gonna bash his face in. That did not go as I had hoped. George, where have you been? You just missed my toast. Mom, I know in your universe it's always about you, But just once, can you just stop and think about someone else? But tonight's my big night. And you should enjoy it. But Carrie and I are going. You're gonna leave me all alone? With 50 of your closest confidants. George, we don't have to go. You're lovely, Carrie, and I'm sure it's hard for you to understand. You're not all alone in the world. My jackass ex-husband dumped me. You know, he left right before the A.B.T. Gala. The biggest social event of the year. And now all I have is George. I can't lose him. George, why don't you go get your mother a tissue and your coat? I can take care of your mom. You don't have to keep crying if you don't want. I know that was all for George's benefit. I have a dad. I know it works. It is effective. And let me be clear. You need to back off. I don't have anyone in my life but George. I'm alone. I understand about being alone in the world. I lost my mom this past year to cancer. And it sucks, but I don't spend every day trying to make people feel sorry for me. I just keep living my life. You're Carrie Bradshaw. Yes, that's me. George didn't tell me your last name. I don't know how I didn't see it. You're just like her. I can't believe I didn't realize you're-- You're Grace's daughter. You knew my mom? Your parents lived in the city when they were first married. Your father and Harlan worked at the same law firm. We hung out all the time. Those were wonderful days. I can't envision my mom here. She loved her garden and driving her car. Your mom left Kicking and screaming. She loved it here-- the energy, the crazy people. Me being one of them. Your mom was fun. And good for me. Although she didn't appreciate this world as much as she should have. Can't imagine why. So why'd they decide to move? Your father didn't think this was a place to raise a family. Your mother cried her last night here. I got her drunk. So why'd she agree to go if she didn't want to? She knew at the end of the day, it was the right choice for her, and for the family she wanted. Grace always used to say, "sometimes Change is good." I thought she was crazy. I always wanted everything to stay the same. Of course, it never does. Your mom used to wear a flower in her lapel. She smelled like spring. Thank you. For what? For giving me a piece of my mom. Am I interrupting? Not at all. You two should get going. The night's still young. When we think about entering new, unchartered territory, it always comes with the idea that we forge ahead. And that's true to some degree. But often to forge ahead, we have to look back to understand what we're leaving behind. And it can be scary because behind us, there are often blind spots... ♪ some folks take their pleasure slow ♪ things we want to ignore or couldn't even see that can stop us from our journey forward. ♪ Futures by ♪ 
♪ living in the past ♪ but only if you let them. At some point, you have to let go of the past and stop looking behind and embrace what comes next. ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ 
♪ to love again ♪ 
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ 
♪ to love again ♪ Their goat cheese is really good. Totally. Mm-hmm. I can't believe you beat that bitch. I did! She's gonna have a big bruise on her butt. Oh, hey, look who showed up! Mouse! Guys, come sit with us. ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ you must be Seth. I'm Walt. What did you say your name was? Um... Walt. Walt? You're the guy. This is the guy. This is the guy? I'm gonna kick your ass! Whoa! Okay, so what's going on? 'cause I can't take any more drama at this diner. I don't want to fight you. Oh, you're afraid? Yeah, sorry should be. Guess what, everybody. Is everything all right? Um, no, but it will be. Okay. Stop. Seth, stop! I didn't sleep with Walt. I lied, all right? I watched a how-to tape with Walt, but I was too mortified to admit it after you told me you slept with other girls. So you... didn't sleep with Walt? Um, hi. He's my boyfriend. Who you probably now think is a huge loser for needing to watch some tape to show me how to have s*x. I think it's sweet. You wanted to please me. So you haven't slept with anybody else? No. But if I had, you would need to be cool with it. So I'm okay with the fact that you did. No double standards, okay? Totally. Totally. I'm sorry. I've been a total ass. Yes, you have. Well, apparently a lot happened while I was in the city. How'd it go? Actually, it went pretty great. And so was today. Got my license! Aah! Hey! Yeah! Congratulations! I was entering new territory, moving on, letting go of the old. My mom was right. Sometimes change is  good.
