 Previously, on  19-2... 
 It's my wife, we... 
 Where is she? 
 This isn't right. 
 You have to pack everything up, otherwise you'll lose it all. 
 No. 
 f*ck you! 
 Get the knife! Get the knife, Tyler! 
 19-2, we have a civilian casualty. There's no pulse. 
 My daughter hasn't come home in three days. 
 How old is she? 
 Sixteen. We have connected someone to the mole. Directly. His name is Antony Tremblay. He's got a thing about kids. 128 gigs of this sh1t. And he's gonna walk. f*ck that. (gunshot) We shouldn't have picked him up. You don't know what happened. Are you OK? Bullshit. Do you think I'm ever gonna trust you? (showers running) (sighing) You fuckers think you're in charge here? Let me tell you how I think it's gonna play... What the f*ck did you do? Yo, he gave us no choice, man, it was either him or us, that's the way it was going down. It's f*cking murder, Cass. No, not murder. This pervert committed suicide. I don't do him, they're coming for both of us. These people don't f*ck around. Look, I'm gonna wipe down the place, alright? You can take off, I got it. No, we'll do it together. I said I got it, man. Alright? Hey. We alright? No, Cass. We're done. You alright? Yeah. I need a shower. Sorry, this road is blocked.  Residents only. Please use Wellington. Thank you. Just go the other way. Thank you, ma'am. (barking) (laughing) Hey! Quit fooling around over there! Get away from that car! It's dangerous! Bite me! This place is all screwed up. Get the f*ck out, bitch! Look at these pricks. Any excuse to exploit a tragedy. Assholes. How long are we gonna wait to start cleaning these idiots out, Sarge? That's up to Intervention. The longer we wait, the tougher it's gonna be. They're digging in right now. What are they doing? sh1t. They're stealing power. We gotta get this done, Sarge. It's not our call. You see this? They're stealing power. Hey, are you deaf? Get away from the car! Get away! (laughing) These kids. Go now! Go get 'em! (dog whimpering) sh1t. You son of a bitch! You're a dog killer! Holster your weapon. You OK? Yeah. They killed a dog! They killed a dog! Everybody back! Everybody back! Everybody back up, please. Back up. Back up, please. You OK? We appreciate your cooperation. Back up, please. Just back up, everybody. It's secure. We appreciate your cooperation. Thank you for backing up. That's it. Back up, sir. Back up, sir. (yelling) Killer! You know, I've been thinking. About him. What about him? I mean, who could mess with the evidence room, hmm? Who could use my logging data? Nobody like you and me. Doesn't make it him. (sighing) I'm thinking maybe it's not a coincidence we ran into Tremblay when we were looking for his daughter. Tremblay was found with a bunch of kiddie p0rn. He even had a kid with him when we first saw him. Maybe that's what he's got on the mole. Pimping kids to him. So now I'm thinking about the commander's daughter. Sandrine? Yeah. Kid's all messed up, angry at her father. Maybe he did something to her. Jesus. We need to find out. All units: full riot gear. Ready to move out in five. Let's go, people. The coroner ruled it accidental. I just don't see why we let a bunch of kids dictate... Alright, thanks. Yes, eviction units armed, just in case. Yes, thank you. We got a problem. Sir? We're getting killed in the media. We need to change the conversation. Yeah, the dog. I just heard. And the accidental death, Favreau. She fell on her own knife, how is that our fault? Turns out she was a mental patient. Now she's being portrayed as a victim and we got the Black Bloc trying to be martyrs. We need to control the story before we evict them. Put Tyler on admin? No, wrong message. She had a juvie record. Attacked a policeman when she was 17. That's sealed. It could leak. Is that really necessary? Not my idea. Alright, listen up. The people in there have only one thing on their minds: make us look like assholes. We're not gonna let them. Once they get here, Intervention is running the show. They will remove protesters from the building. We're just here to provide support. If you need to hold anyone, main floor. But only Intervention brings them out onto the street. Are we clear on that? Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah, don't bruise the merchandise, we got it. Do we know if there are squatters in there? Operating assumption is yes. Not everyone will be Black Bloc, so use your heads, alright? (laughter) Oh, sh1t! (yelling) I'm coming for you, asshole! Yeah, you come up, prick! Come down here, you piece of sh1t! f*ck you! Come get some more! We're coming for you, asshole. Go get cleaned up. God! What the hell? We're on hold. Yes, I know. No, it's not happening today. Intervention's been called off. What the hell? They lock it down and we sit around and wait! Hey, it's not up to me. The department's decided to let it wait. Until when? Not today. Alright, change of plans. Gear down. It's not happening today. Sarge, man. So what's going on? Politics. The department's afraid of another bad headline too soon after the last one. They put me on it. Since when do they have you on media relations? I guess since we started killing dogs and crazy ladies. I'm the new face of f*cking up. Who do these idiots think they are? Shame on you, killer! They think they're bringing justice for the dead. Wasn't your fault. I'll be fine. It's all part of the job, right? ♪ (knocking) Come in. Morning, sir. I just wanted to, um... follow up about your daughter. What about her? Is, uh... is everything cool there? She's an addict. Yes, sir, I understand that, I just... I don't know. I just wanted to offer any help that I could. What kind of help? I could talk to her. No, I, um... I don't think so, but... thanks for your concern. OK. What's going on? How long are we gonna be doing this sh1t? They're coming. The question is when. Stop complaining, guys. Yesterday we were freezing. Everything OK? I'm looking for my wife. I can't find her. Alright, when's the last time you seen her? At the shelter. But she... she wants to come back here. She gets lost, she's not safe. Alright, alright. So you haven't seen her today? No. No. Not since last night. Someone took our TV from the shelter. Alright, we'll find her. Can't find his wife, she's missing. Yeah, I remember your wife. Do you... Actually, what was her name again? Uh... Lina Dumoulin. Do you have a recent picture of her? Hm. It's from before, but she doesn't really look the... the same any... Let's go, folks. Joseph, Hamelin, let's go. Alright, you two watch the street. Yes, sir. We need four volunteers on the supporting side. Uh, Nick, Ben, J.M., Audrey, follow him. Group two! One, move! Group, my left, quick, march! protesters chanting : Killer! Killer! Killer! Police! Quick! Police! Police! Police! (yelling) (yelling) Come over here. Hold on arrestees on the first floor. Turn around, please. You have anything on you? Hands in front of you like this, please. (protesters chanting) It f*cking stinks in here. Those are their toilets. Ugh! Stand at the door. (banging on door) (yelling) I demand the police be held accountable for their actions! Cut it up! They raise this whole block... Hands behind your back. We stand for the rights of the poor and demand public housing be made available for... f*ck! What did I do? What the f*ck did I do? Hands behind your back! Put a tie on him. That's police brutality! Say hi to the camera, big man! Any weapons? Am I gonna find anything on you? It's just us now, how about that, huh? Hey, hey, relax. I got it. Not your problem! You heard him. He said we got this. Take him downstairs. Let's go. 19-2, confirm your location. I got him. I got him. Aren't you gonna say thank you? f*ck you. Close enough. Bringing out second group now. Get your hands off of me, you f*cking pig. We should be in there. No skin off my nose. Let Intervention clean that sh1t up. (alarm ringing) What the hell is that? We have a robbery in progress, Wellington and Charest. sh1t. We can cut through there. Come on. Aw, sh1t. Move your ass. Police coming through! Over here, on the right! Hey! Hey! (sirens blaring) Stop it right there! I said stop right there! Drop it! Hands! Drop it! Hands! Hands in the front. Hold it right there! What do you think you're doing, lady? The TV is mine! Yeah, I'll take that. What are you doing? Lina! Hey, whoa! What's going on? The TV is mine! Listen, I know this lady, OK? She's looting. They were caught looting. Take it easy, bro. I'm telling you I know this lady. She's saying it's her TV. Work it out downtown. Listen... No, you listen to me. Zero tolerance on looting. This is not your f*cking show, OK? Back off. Stop it! What are you doing? Alright, alright! Lina, it's gonna be OK! It's OK. It's OK. Lina! It's gonna be OK. You sold it! It's true, what she said. What'd she say? I pawned her TV. (sighing) 19-4, what's the story? We needed the cash. Got looters at a pawn shop. We made three arrests, Intervention made another. It's OK. You two! Alright, wake up. We need you to get out of the building. Team 7, regroup on main floor. Copy, team 7 on main floor. There's buckets of sh1t all over this place. This one's yours. Alright, sir, let's shut her down. I'm cooking dinner. You're not gonna be eating here tonight, so let's go. I live here. It's the only food I got. My last supper. So if you don't mind... Hey, shut the burner off, let's go. We ain't got time for this. Come on. Come on, let's go. Hey! Watch out! Get the burner! sh1t! (loud electric shock) 19-7, we have a man electrocuted in the basement. Copy. Oh sh1t... Oh, man. Come on, man. Don't make me do this, please, don't make me do this, you dirty mother... Come on! Come on! 19-7, we need an ambulance on site. sh1t! Come on! Are you OK? Yeah, yeah. Don't touch the grate, it'll electrocute you. Come on! Come on! Basement is trapped, be alert. Copy that. You got it, you got it! It's an electrocution. He's breathing and responsive. Sir, you need to stay calm for me, OK? Bring him up. OK, yes. Stay down. Yeah, you hear me? Can you see me? Just look at me, stay with me. That's right. Just breathe. Relax, it's gonna be OK. 
 
 ♪ (siren blaring) We got a guy from the city coming to cut the power. We don't know what other booby traps these assholes have set. Chartier, Barron, follow me. Good work. Thank you, Sarge. That was so gross. Yeah, well, he's gonna be OK. Guys, I want you to keep an eye out. Make sure the city guy can do his job. They cut the power. Yeah, let's have some fun. You, uh... you talk to Amélie? Tried to. She asked if I could come by and pick up the rest of her things. Don't worry about it, I'll bring them by. No, I'll come get 'em. She was never a part of it. OK, guys, it's a blackout inside. Be careful, stay together. Yes, sir. Yes. Let's go, gear up. Suit up, folks. 19-4 moving to the top floor, southern section. Copy, 19-4. Get some goddamn light in here. (yelling) Leave him alone! I wanna talk to my lawyer! Take him. Let go of me, you pig! Oh, sh1t... What's wrong with you, dog? Huh? Wait up! (yelling) Oh, sh1t. Settle down. I got this one. Hey, you wanna go down the stairs face first? Huh? You wanna? That's it, settle down. Attaboy. Relax. Hey, I got one! Police! Come here! f*ck! Stop it! Stop it! Give it up! Jesus Christ. Stop it! Let me go! What do you think you're doing, huh? Come here. Let it go! Get off of me! Why? What do you think you're accomplishing here? You f*cking bitch! Don't be an idiot. You're in enough trouble. You good? Yeah, I'm fine. They're trying to get out. Alright? Sit up. Get your one leg forward, OK? On the count of three, you're gonna get up. Don't hurt yourself. Three, alright, attagirl. You're sure you're good? Yeah. Alright. Oh, sh1t. (panting) Hurry up, man, you're slowing us down. Jesus Christ, it's f*cking dark in here. 19-2, we're in the north section with Intervention team B. Copy that. Stay sharp. Mm-hmm. J.M.: Tell me, Sarge, just answer the question... sh1t. ♪ What are you doing? You good? Yeah. Let's go. Let's go! Garage area is sealed. Copy that. I have a woman trying to get into the building. Get rid of her. I did that. She came back. OK, hold on the squatter. (heavy breathing) Bea... Bear. Bear! Bear! Bear! What?! Oh... This one... this one is clear. Yeah, OK. Keep moving. Check over here. You killed Favreau! Take that, bitch! sh1t! Come here, you little prick! Tyler! Bear! Ah! Bear! (coughing) Help! Bear! Tyler! Tyler! Tyler! Little sh1t! Ha, ha, ha! Tyler...

Get your f*cking hands off me, you pig! No, it's fine, thanks. You alright? Yeah. What the f*ck is wrong with you? Look at me! You left me there. You left me there and he was kicking me. You're not fit for the job. You're a f*cking disgrace. I'm done. Let's move along, please, folks. Show's over. Sandrine! I need to know where you are. Trouble in paradise? Looks like it. Joseph, you alright? Yeah. What happened in there? Ah... what can I say? We got hit with... tear gas. Obviously weren't ready for it, so... it was very disorienting. Where was Beatrice? I was... I was right behind her. When the gas hit, all hell broke loose in there and it got very, uh... very confusing. Did you leave your partner? I couldn't breathe, sir. She's asking for a partner change. You're on solos till this gets sorted out. You got that? Hey, cop. Now you know what it's like to be sh1t on! Do you know what you just did? f*cking piece of sh1t, fucker! What the f*ck, you f*cking prick! Stop! Stop! My eyes! You f*cking piece of sh1t! Audrey, enough! Audrey! m*therf*cker! Ah!! Bitch!! Get up. Get up! Put your hands behind your back. You OK?

Get up! (gunshot) (Audrey screaming) Get the f*ck back in there! You f*cking shut that thing off, do you hear that? f*ck that! All of you, get back! It's the law! It's the f*cking law! How the hell do we spin that? I'm not sure. I don't know how we could protect her. Pepper spray... The kid threw a bucket of excrement on her. So what, he deserved it? He assaulted her. You  can  understand her anger? You know, you did a great job handling the media throughout the eviction, but this is bad for the whole department. Public sees a pattern, and people upstairs, they're watching. You handle the situation with Pouliot right, it'll be noticed. (sobbing softly) I'm so sick of this place. 19-4, I need backup, I've got a man dousing himself in gasoline in the parking lot. Sir? What was that? sh1t! Sir? Sir? Put that down. You don't need to do this. Put that down, please. That's right. No, no, no, no, put the lighter down. We are all here to help you. There's no need to do this. Please, listen to me. Put the lighter down. Hey, Paul... Tyler, stand down. Tyler. It's OK. It's OK. OK, Paul. Paul... Paul, we're all here to help you. Paul, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK. It's OK. Paul... Paul... You don't have to do this, bro. OK? No, no! Tyler, no, no! Tyler! There you go. Now I'm just like you, Paul. That's right. It's OK, Paul, it's OK. I understand. Paul. I know what you're going through, Paul, but it's not your fault. Paul, look at me. It's not your fault. (Paul sobbing) It's not your fault. It's OK. (sobbing) It's OK. It's OK. Go, go, go, go. (sobbing) 19-7, cancel fire truck. Situation under control. You and I know what transpired. The public sees what the media tells them. It's bullshit, we know that. But the department has to put on a show. You understand that? They're still dealing with the fallout from the woman with the knife. So, what, I'm just hung out to dry? Is that what this... Absolutely not. You have the department's full support. (journalists talking) We have viewed the video and are taking the matter seriously. An internal investigation is under way and the officer has been removed from duty. You're not being suspended. The department is offering you two months' paid leave. I think it would be a good idea to take some time off, let things cool down. If the officer is found to have shown willful misconduct, her contract with the Montreal police will be terminated. There will be no investigation, no impact on your record. Excessive force in the department will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Thank you. Detective! (all asking questions) At the end of your leave, you'll be reinstated to duty without further recourse. Why are you doing this? To protect you. You're gonna read things in the paper; they're not true. It's just PR. The department's got your back. It would be wise if you accepted the offer. It's all there. Thanks. Thanks. If there's anything you miss, let me know. Can't think of anything. I think I was wrong. About what? About him using you to get to me. He's a straight guy, Am. He didn't want to be lying to you. Don't. Just let it be. Hey. I wanna talk to you about something. I already heard it. Actually, no, you haven't. Yeah. I have. From you and from Sarge. You don't wanna ride with me anymore, I understand that. I'll get me another partner. That's not what I want to talk to you about. What did you wanna talk about? Huh? Was that you grabbing that lighter out the guy's hand out there? No. Was that you saving somebody's life? Huh? So don't tell me I don't know how to do my job, 'cause that is my goddamn job! Alright, I'm sorry. No, no, no. I'm afraid of the dark, Bear. That's why I ran. And that's why I left you. (exhaling) I know. So I understand if you don't wanna ride with me. No. (clearing throat) Actually, we're good. (sighing) Sandrine Gendron hasn't been to class in more than a week. She's AWOL. Think she ran away again? I'm guessing yeah. Checked on the boyfriend; apparently he's moved out. You don't know where he went? Not yet. He's lying about it. You really think he could've done that? Molested his own kid? (sighing) Hey. Excuse me. Do you know this girl? Look at the picture. Do you know her? No, I'm sorry, dude. Don't lie to me. Dude, I don't know who she is, man. Alright? I'm not f*cking around, alright? Do you understand me? She's a junkie, she's around here all the time. I need to find her. ♪
