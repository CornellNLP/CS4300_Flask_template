 Previously on  19-2... 
 You must be realizing by now that your riding with him is not an accident, right? We want you close to him. 
 Ready, Ben? 
 Audrey's alive and she's a fighter. Let's stay focused. 
 19-2, we have shots fired inside Viger High School. 
 Everybody down! 
 If you can go, go now! 
 Tyler's down! 
 Do you want to get us killed? Do you want to get us all killed? 
 (gunshots and screams) 
 I'm coming for you right now! 
 19-2. 
 We've neutralised the threat. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Ben. 
 Ben. 
 Hello? 
 Benjamin! 
 Don't hang up. 
 What do you want? 
 I saw your photo in the paper last week. 
 Those damn kids in the school. 
 I didn't even have to read the article. 
 I knew it was you who took him down. 
 I told your mother I knew it was you. 
 How far off was he? 
 Twenty yards. 
 Twenty yards... Where'd you hit him? 
 Right between the eyes, I bet. 
 Tell me. 
 Yeah. 
 Good boy. 
 I didn't even have to read the damn article. 
 I already knew-- 
 Your dad? 
 You know it was. 
 (gunshot) 
 How's your week been? 
 You holding up? 
 I got, uh... Tyler's log. Late, sick, sick... Logs off on the job an awful lot. He's going for a drink is my guess. We already know about his little alcohol problem, but thank you. Have you heard from Nick yet since you've been off? No. He hasn't sent any flowers, nothing? No phone calls? No, we don't, uh... We're not like that. Well, you start being like that. You should look into Brouillard's place. It's nice. It's too nice for a cop. His wife comes from money. Well, what about Houle? He lives in a mansion, his wife doesn't work. Houle's a sprinkler king. He was audited last year. Chartier, why don't you just let us worry about the big picture? You focus on Barron. You said the mole could be anybody in 19. Hey, you're not privy to everything we are. Be helpful if I was. Nick's your partner. You should know where he is after hours, who he's hanging out with. Does he use his personal cell phone on the job? Who's he talking to, exactly? Well, I'm on forced leave, so there's not much I can do. I gotta go. You're gonna be cleared for active duty. When? Next day or two. Act surprised. You're welcome. ♪ (TV playing) Morning, sunshine. Good morning. Damn, that smells good. You two stay up late last night? Yeah, too late. I gotta go. Where do you think you're going? Sit your ass down. Third time you stay here and you ain't took my breakfast once. Alright. This looks delicious, thank you. More regrettable news today,  the ninth victim  of the Viger school shooting died in the hospital last night. Nine kids now. Oh, my ears. There will be a memorial  service at the... White boys gone crazy. Hiya. Oh, yes. Hmm... (children laughing) I gotta go. (incoherent) Thank you, sunshine. (laughing) Good morning. No, no, no, no! Come on! Hey, you guys see what happened to the bike here? Man, what bike? Motorcycle, BMW. Ain't no BMWs out here, bro. My brother got a Ninja. Ninja's better than Beemer. (laughing) (loud music playing) Yo man, turn that sh1t down. OK, Dad. (laughing) Thanks for the lift. Yeah. Well, good morning to you and yours. Good morning to you. Nice earring you got there, Elton. With the nice coat. So, how's your boyfriend? Oh, that's good. That's good, boys. Hey. I'm sorry. How's it feel to be back? I think it's weirder for everybody else than it is for me. Yeah. I just don't want any special treatment, you know? Well, you won't get any from me. There she is! Good to have you back. Hey, sweet scar! You look like a hot zombie cop or something. - Shut up. I'm serious, I wish I had a scar like that! Yeah, yeah. I don't know what he's talking about. You look great. - Thanks. Grab a seat, folks. First of all, I would like to welcome back Audrey Pouliot. (cheers and whistles) OK, the latest beautiful faces to be on the lookout for. Just a reminder, counseling is available. I know some of you are mandated to go, but it is for everybody and it is a good thing. Tyler should be back on duty any day now. Till then, Bea, I'm putting you with Pouliot. I thought me and Audrey were riding together. I'm giving you and JM the honour of 19-7, not once, but twice. What? Why? Somebody's gotta work a double. You're up, buddy. Yay. Uh, Barron, 19-2 solo until Chartier gets back. Speak of the devil. OK, that's it, folks. Take care of each other out there. Oh, too slow! Too much paid vacay. Easy. Good to see you, buddy. Thanks, man. - So are you back? Who wants to know? I'll wait for you outside. Cool. Sir? I need you to report to the Viger High School command post later today. - Why? SQ just needs a follow-up. It's across from the school. More questions? It's a big investigation. Yeah, I get it. Cool, sounds good. And as of tomorrow morning, you're back on duty. Really? Wow, that's... that's great news. I think it's a bit too soon. If I'm cleared, I'm ready. OK. BMW, copper trim, 2006. Where'd it go missing from? 9000 block, Jarry. Castro Towers?! No sh1t it went missing! What were you doing out there? Barron? My bike got stolen. Aw, sh1t. - Yeah. Do what you gotta do, I'll see you outside. Alright. You good? It's crazy. It's kinda weird, huh, me getting called back in the school? Not that weird. You getting some rest? Yeah, why? You look wired. Too much coffee. You, uh... you having dreams or anything, about... About the shooting? No, uh... I don't know, it was... You seeing the cop shrink? Yeah. I don't know what I'm supposed to say there, you know. The kid was shooting other kids, so I had to use deadly force, end of story. Wouldn't quite put it like that. How am I supposed to put it? Sounds like you bottling sh1t up. I'm not bottling anything up. Don't be defensive. Why would I... You can f*ck off. (laughing) It's alright. I've been there. See you tomorrow. Yeah. You know, at first it was tough, man. All the shaking and flopping around. Sweating through the sheets. But it's all good now, baby, 'cause it's eight days without a drop, you hear me? Too bad you had to take a bullet for that to happen. Everything happens for a reason, right? I'll see you on Wednesday, Mr. Joseph. Yes, ma'am. She's hot. She's alright. Yeah, man, eight days. I haven't been clean that long since I was... since I was a cadet. That's a long time, man. So the morphine dripped in, huh? No, it did not. They got me on perks, too, man. Yeah? I don't take 'em. What about you, man? How you coping with the shooting? It's fine, it's good. Yeah, back tomorrow. I told them I'd quit if they put me on desk. (laughing) My man. I like that. How about the shrink, you seeing one? Mm-hmm. I mean, after what you've been through, I think it's a good idea. Yeah, I don't know, it's just... Hey, this ain't a deposition, man. Alright? Just received a report  from the hospital on patrolman Tyler Joseph. Yes, and? He's been released. He's recovering at home. Good news. I'm not done. His blood alcohol level at the time of surgery was... 0.18. Judging from your reaction, this isn't a shock. No, it is not. How bad is he? Never on the job, as far as I know. It was early morning; my bet is he was still loaded from the night before. - 0.18. That's one hell of a hangover. OK, I'll take care of it. Sergeant, we need to make sure this doesn't leak out prematurely, so, um... let's keep it close for now. How close? You and me. I'm Detective Vicky Dole. Ben Chartier. I know. I'm sorry about the shitty locale. Not a lot of choices near the school. Yeah, I understand. Well, uh, it's not gonna take very long. We just need some help filling in the timeline. 
♪ 
♪ 
I've set up back there. OK, I'll follow you. Stop running every goddamn plate you see, alright? It's distracting me. I can't stop. Alright, so the guy in front of us? Ooh, he's been convicted of indecent exposure three times! What a perv, look at him. Disgusting. 19, robbery at St. Denis Bar, on the patio. Dispatch, this is 19-7, we're just on the corner, we got it. Oh, here we go. It is there. Those waves are for me, just know that, alright? You wish. Afternoon, ladies. Somebody call for the police? Yeah, we did. OK. Um... This kid... this kid just went by on a bike and we were sitting here drinking and he took all of our purses right off of the table. What did he look like? He was a kid, like... twelve years old or something? A kid. So, black, white? Help me out here. White kid. He was a little white kid. He went around the corner. He has all of our money and our ID. My purse was Fendi! That's a nice purse. Very expensive. Uh, how long ago was this? Ten minutes or so. Give us a minute, ladies. Alright, you take the car, go see if you can find the kid or something, I don't know. You're not coming? No. I will take statements. They're kind of cute. I don't mind taking statements. I know you don't. I'll be fine. Yeah, I bet you'll be fine. I bet you'll be great. OK, ladies. One at a time. Thanks again for coming down. Yeah, no sweat. And, uh... I speak for the entire SQ when I say thank you for a job well done. Sure. And if there's anything else... You're the one who shot him? Yeah, it was you. OK, that's enough. Let's not bother the officer. - Bam, just like that, dropped him with the one shot. You have to be back in class now, isn't that right? It's just woodwork. Let's go, come on. You have my number. He's not being suspended? We are getting a very positive message on Viger so far. I don't wanna dilute it. So this is all about optics? We need to address Tyler Joseph, but we need to do it internally. He was loaded on the job! That's a zero tolerance issue! And this is also a privacy issue for the officer involved. You think he's gonna magically get better all by himself with us helping to cover this up? Look, I'm not gonna allow the media to turn the face of the Viger shooting into a drunk. He is a drunk! And we're gonna get him help, Sarge. But this is damage control 101, and if you don't have the stomach for it, I don't know what the hell to tell you. Listen to me. This guy is gonna get somebody killed, and that will be on you. Do you have the stomach for that? Optics. 
 
 (music playing) 14-1, we're on Papineau. We'll look into it. Come on... What are the odds of this? Is that you, little buddy? Is that you, little buddy? 19-7, I'm in pursuit of a Caucasian juvenile on a BMX in the alley on St. Denis south of Sherbrooke. Copy, 19-7. Do you need backup? (screaming) Hey, police! Hey! Ma'am, are you okay? You alright? Come here, come here! Hey! Come here! You okay, ma'am? Where you going, little dude? Stop! Stop! That's enough! Hey! How do I do this? Oh, oh, oh! Hey, police! Hey, whoa! (grunting) Stop resisting! grunting : Sir, you're under arrest! 14-21, pick up. I just took down a 500-pound sumo wrestler by myself. It took three of us to get him in the van. Take a look. See that? Good time right there. Alright, alright, you want your hero moment? Yeah, I want my hero moment. OK, take your hero moment, baby boy. Wipe away your tears and man the f*ck up, OK? I'm back. Oh, my God! - Which one's yours? You got them? You guys are amazing! Thank you so much! That's fine. Uh, where is Sasha Renaud? Where is she? She went to the bathroom. I'll be back. Good. (loud music) (knocking) Ma'am, Montreal police. Oh my goodness, you actually found it! I can't believe it! Is everything in here? I don't know, uh... Yeah, you should probably take a look and make sure everything's there. OK, don't go anywhere. It's all here, I can't believe it. Seriously, this purse is my life. I don't know how to thank you. Just doing my job. No, uh... really. Thank you. (laughing) Stay for a while. Have a drink. I would love to. Unfortunately, we have some official police business to attend to, so... No, you don't. Yes, I do. You know where the washroom is? (moaning) Oh, for f*ck. You, my friend,  are what they call screwed. Oh yeah. Such a rookie mistake, my God! When they say rookie mistakes... Oh yeah, that's the mistake they're talking about. You're... you're not gonna say anything, right? Man, no, I am not going to say anything. Please. But I'm not gonna not say anything, either. Alright, so, I mean... what happens? You go to meetings, random testing. How many meetings? Three a week for a year. You'll kill me, man. Three a week for a year?! I don't think it's nearly enough. (deep sigh) So, no suspension and this stays off my record? You do that, the department will support you any way they can. Alright. I'll take the deal. Good, because you're not gonna get a third chance. Listen to me. Addiction can be very difficult to tackle on your own. There's no shame in it. I'm good, man, I got this. Yeah. I can do this. OK. Thanks. I had a blowup on the job today. A blowup that's been building for a long time. I felt like I was enabling one of my men's alcoholism. And I was, but... I was powerless to do anything about it. It's a good reminder, because I could see the beast operating in his head. So familiar. My beast hasn't gone anywhere. Still there, coming up with ways for me to hurt myself, to hurt others, if I don't learn to let go and to keep coming here. Thank you. You heard from Nick yet  since you've been off? No. - Nick's your partner. You should know where he is after hours, Does he use his personal cell phone on the job? Well, who is he talking to exactly? Do you know that? I'm cleared for duty. I don't, uh... I don't know why I have to keep coming here. You're free to go at any time. Yeah, but then you'll... make a note in my file. I... I don't know what else... I don't know what else there is to be said. It's very common after a traumatic event to experience... insomnia, nightmares, a feeling of anxiety. What are you feeling right now? Ben? Guil... guilty. That's a very normal response. Not about the shooting. I, uh... did what I had to do there. What then? I don't know, but I don't like the feeling. What do you have to feel guilty about? It's okay, I'm, uh... Yeah, I'm fine. I gotta get going. We still have twenty minutes. You said I was free to go any time I like. I guess there's no chance of getting my old one back, huh? Have a look at this. How does it feel? It's good. It's a bit stiff, but it's good. I'll probably just start from scratch, strip it down, do it myself. - Yeah, I figured. (screaming) Are you ready? Of course I'm ready. It's good to be back. - Hey, that's enough! Ow! Stop resisting! Stop resist-- Stop f*cking resisting! Stop f*cking resisting! Stop! Stop! Ben! Ben, let him go! Stop! That's enough! (choking) I didn't do it! I didn't do anything! It wasn't me! I didn't do anything! You alright? Yeah. I was a f*cking idiot. That was a dangerous hold back there. I know! Thought the bike pump was a gun. It happens to all of us. If you want, we can take the afternoon and-- No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just telling you what I'm seeing from where I'm sitting. It's okay. What's this? What the hell? Let's call this in. - Yeah. 19-4, suspicious vehicle, Pointe-St-Charles rail yard. You good? Yeah, I'm good. Copy, 19-4. The f*ck is he doing to her? Knife. both shouting together : Police! Get out of the car now! Hands over your head! Hans above your head, now! Drop it! Drop the weapon! I'm just a dentist! I said drop the weapon now! It's not a-- It's sickle scaler for tartar! For tartar! (music and conversations) Yo, you made it! Nice! Are you doing good? I'm good, man, I'm good, yes! Good, good. What's going on here? Nothing, man, but you know, sometimes you got to pay a fire inspector from time to time, you know? That's all. I'm good. Doesn't exactly look up to code. That's what I'm saying. Yo, what was I just saying? What was I just saying? You can't be cooking Italian sausage on a motherfucking shopping cart, man. Put out the fire. It's better this way. I said put out the fire. Don't make me do something, see? Alright, yo, out this. You hungry? Yeah. Come, come, come. Smells amazing out here. Sausage. Mamacita! Baby. Hey. Hey. My cousin Nicky needs to get in all kinds of sh1t down here. Show me that here, man. Hey, should we get into that? Hey, remember that BB gun? Where'd that come from? You stole it. - No, no, no, no. Anyway, we had us some sweet spots, take time and practice. Holed up in that old Ford behind the florist, remember that? Yeah, that was... that one time you-- So nigga goes, he goes "Check this out". He takes the rifle, right? And he aims it at the old woman's-- Wait, wait, wait. What? What? What you talking 'bout? Let me tell the story, man. So he aims it at the old lady's bird feeder, right? He lets out two of 'em, bam, bam! Right through the old woman's window-- No, no, no. That was you. - What? I was telling you not to! Anyways... Yeah, so the woman comes running out of the back, right? Her housecoat flies open, her titties are like... Ah, sh1t! Oh, man... You want a new beer, man? No, man, I just wanna know if, uh... you have any word on my bike. Yeah, hold on. Yo, sweetness! Sweetness! Get my man a beer, please! Yes. Hey, you want a new bike? I can get you a Kawasaki. Want a Kawasaki? No, man, I don't want a Kawasaki. I want my bike. Hey, I want you to meet someone. No, you know-- Shh, shh, shh! Nick, I want you to meet my girl Gloria. How you doing? Nicky's a police officer. Oh, Jesus Christ! The man's just here having a drink, man, trying to keep a low profile, come on! It's his job. You don't hear me going around telling people you do nails! Hey, I'm a cosmetologist. Exactly. Why don't you take the night off, please? Alright? We're just trying to have some fun here. So, you... working? OK. (laughing) So what was he doing to you back there? Just a cleaning. Teeth cleaning. For free? Yeah, he's harmless. What's the catch? When I give a blowjob and I swallow, I call him so it's still fresh on my breath. Jesus. What can I say? I had four cavities last month and he pulled them right out. He does good work. Alright, you stay right here, ma'am. Mm-hmm. I really don't think there's a charge here. Dentistry for jizz breath in the face? I don't know, it should be illegal. - I'm gonna send her on her way with a warning. I'll talk to him. Sir, this area was designated a prostitution-free zone and the woman you were with is known as a s*x worker. That's enough to charge you with soliciting. But I didn't solicit anything. Which is why I'm letting you go with a warning this time, but I don't want to see you down here again. Understood? You wouldn't want something like this to mess up your practice, Dr. Perreault. You've had a lot of work done, haven't you? Nice teeth. You're free to go. Now. Hey, need some help with this? No, I'm almost done. - I can help. Just... I got the instructions in my head, it'll be even more confusing with two people. I hate this. When the walls go up. Sorry. You need to talk to someone. But I wish you would talk to me. Why are you... It's okay, I'm fine. I'm going to bed. (sighing) (cell phone buzzing)

Thank you. It was amazing. Gloria. It was very nice to meet you. You're f*cked up. (chuckling) It's alright. I'm f*cked up too. Well, that's reassuring. It is what it is, my man. All I know, fighting it just makes it worse. For me anyway. sh1t, five beers and I'm already starting to feel it. Five beers? Where were ya? Some barbecue in Castro. My cousin, Cass. The guy with the snake? No, it wasn't his snake. Whose snake was it? Who cares? It's in a better place now. Two more. Your round, pal. Yup. I gotta piss. 17-45, I'm on it. How was the shrink? It was good. No surprises. I forgot my jacket last night. Well, you were feeling no pain. Gimme a minute. (phone buzzing) Here. Yeah? Tonight? Uh, yeah, I'll call you when I'm off. Pop the trunk for me, will ya? Yep. (chuckling) Thank you. You're welcome. Rasclat Babylon! Mind your business. Don't worry, I'll make security keep his ass outside. Don't be mean, Cass.

He's my partner. There's a code. Hey, was the guy sure? We'll find out. Thanks, man. (engine roaring) (dog barking) Oh, sh1t! What's wrong? You alone? Yeah. What's up? I don't know, I, uh... I don't know what I'm doing here. Where's your girlfriend? At home. Where are you? Working a double. It's okay. You don't have to talk about it. Come on.
