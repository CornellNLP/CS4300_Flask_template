 Previously on 19-2... - Nick! 
 He had a f*cking gun to my head! 
 And now it's over! 
 Are you telling me not to call this in? 
 Hit and run. 
 Boy, maybe 10 years old. He's unconscious. 
 He's your father! 
 He's your father, Ben! 
 Oh my God! Hi! 
 (Giggling) 
 We have 12 hours! 
 What? 
 Nick : It was just a thing, Izzy, all right? It's over. 
 Isabelle : When? 
 A couple months ago. Whatever, Nick! It's your life. You asked me to leave, Izzy, remember? Yeah, but I wanted it to work, Nick. How did your little meeting with the commander go? Hmm? He asked me to report on you. I said no. (Water running) (Snoring) (Grunting) (Snorting, groaning) Aren't you supposed to be on the couch? Sorry, bro. I threw up all over it. Ah, sh1t! (Sighing) Ah, sh1t, Tyler! Jesus! Sorry, bro. Shouldn't you have left? (Sighing) Hey! (Birds chirping) Honestly, bro, our job sucks! When I sleep, I hear sirens in my head, man. Don't do that. We gotta go. They won't leave me alone. This one demon, every time he opens his mouth, man, it's like a freaking siren, man! (Imitating siren wailing) Even when I'm drunk, they won't leave me alone. Hey, come on, man! Don't do that! Get your sh1t together! We're on shift here. Yeah, you're right. I'm right behind you, bro! Door locks itself. All right. It reeks in here! Close that door on your way out. Sir, yes, sir! Close that door on your way out. (Telephone ringing) Sorry. Do you know what day it is today? Friday? The date! The first of the goddamn month, boss! Welfare day. On a Friday. You will be earning your overtime pay today, boys and girls. Right on! Maybe we'll get some action this week. Next time you're late, you'll be written up! Keep an eye on the ATMs, folks. Lots of cash being spent today. Our tax dollars at work. All right, hit the streets. Look after each other. Why so sour, big cat? I ain't doing this sh1t, man. Really? Sir! This is bullshit. We're 2 parties short, and you're talking overtime? I gotta put bodies on the street. Yeah, well, I ain't doing no double. I got plans. I'll call my steward. Your commitment to the team is duly noted. I gotta stop and get some aspirin. I went out with Tyler last night. JM was buying shots. Woman on police radio :  I don't have any solos. Don't worry about it. Tyler's still banging them back, huh? Mm-hmm. The guy's hardcore. Bad day to be hungover. So welfare day's a big deal around here? It is if you're living on welfare. One day a month, you got cash in your pocket. The rest of the time, you're counting dimes to eat. Of course, they'd go a little crazy. Woman : In 19, disturbance at a depanneur, corner of Rouin and Delorme. 19-2. We'll take it. Rouin and Delorme. Copy 19-2. (Man shouting, indistinct) (Siren beeping) I want my beer! One goddamn beer! I get my money today! You'll get paid, you goddamn Nazi! Nick : All right! All right! Look, just settle down, okay? One beer! Tell her! No beer! He owes too much already! For Christ's sake, I'm going to the bank! So go! So give me my beer! Look, settle down, okay? Jesus Christ! What the hell are you doing? Jamaican accent : Yeah! How you like that? (Laughing) Bumbaclot! No penalty! No way! Get down here! Me not goin' nowhere! On my bloodclot TV that, goddamn referees are bullshit! Jamaican accent : This is not your street, fat man, all right? Now, get down here! Don't make me come up and get you, now! The guy's drunk, man. Hold on! Don't get your panties twisted! Hold on, man! Sir, it's time to go. Let's move it along. She rips me off! You owe me money. I'm gonna be back! I don't wanna see you back here again! How much? No, no, no. Put it away. You take it! Me pay! Put your money away, all right? Pick up your TV and take it off the street. Don't throw no more bloodclot sh1t off your balcony, you hear? All right, sir! All right, man! You didn't even see the call. The game fixed! (Cell ringing) (Laughing) Yeah! Ben : We're here to help. Woman : Thank you. All right, you let us know. Yeah. Have a nice day. (Sighing) Show me. He did it again. He's so stressed from work right now. Why do you defend him? You need to make a complaint. Call the doctors. Take pictures. Let me do something about it. No! I'm trusting you. You're the only one I can talk to. It could be a lot worse than a black eye next time. (Crying) (Sighing) Isn't that on his record? Let me put it this way. I think I could be of more help if I understood why you're asking. Of course! You know where to find me. (Knocking) You wanted to see me, commander? Come in. I just wanted to be clear about something. Apparently, there's a story going around that I asked Officer Chartier to spy on your husband. It's not true. I want you to know that. All right. So, you didn't ask Chartier to report to you? Of course, I did! I mean, Nick's coming off a traumatic event, and he's out there on the front lines. I mean, I need to know how he's doing. That's my job! Look, I didn't ask Chartier to be a stool pigeon. I asked him to look out for his partner and to keep me informed. I mean, frankly, I would've asked you to do the same if you were working with him. I work with Nick everyday, sir. Anyways, I understand how it could look, so I decided to drop the request. And I'm worried about Nick. Is that a crime? Thank you for the explanation. Was that all? Yep, that's all. Thank you, sir. Woman on PA :  Sgt. McKinnon, report to the equipment room, please. I got a right to get my car out! No one's disputing that. The guy blocks my drive! This isn't the first time, either! You get a plate number? No, I didn't get a plate number! He's a pizza guy, okay? A black guy. What pizza place? I don't know! He had pizzas, okay? And they probably weren't even real pizzas. He's probably selling drugs. And why do you say that? Why do you think? Young, black guys hanging around, what do you think they're doing? Oh, gee, I don't know. Maybe the same thing as white guys hanging around. Sir, if it happens again, take a plate number, and we'll check on it, okay? Why can't you guys do something about this for once? Get these people off the street! What people? What people? I told you! I got crooks hanging around my corner blocking my driveway all the time! Black people, right? Is that why they're crooks? Spell it out for me. I didn't say that, okay? Yeah, I think you did! Well, I am entitled to my own opinions. Well, how about you keep your opinions to yourself. You see a crime being committed, you let us know. You don't like where you live? Move! This is bullshit! Okay? I am a taxpayer! I demand to make a statement! All right, let's make a statement! What kind of car was it? I don't know what kind! I was looking at the black guy! Man on radio :  In 19, disregard the call about the stolen minivan. Harvey :  Well, don't let it get to you. There are assholes everywhere on this job, not just civilian. You hold up okay. When I started out, I had armour. I was goddamn bulletproof. Now the wind just blows right through me. You just gotta let it go. JM :  19-7, requesting support. Alley running north of St. Zotique, east of Bordeaux. 19-2 responding. What's your situation? I got a party running out of control. What's the alleged crime here? I just told you. The party's getting rowdy! Let me clarify. You're requesting backup for a noise complaint? Fucking-- Would you like to break it up alone? Woman :  19-2, are you responding? Hey, take it easy! Copy. We're nearly there. (Cheering) (♪ Rock on stereo ) ♪ What the f*ck is your problem, man? I call for backup, and you bust my balls on air? I'm not the one who needs backup for a noise complaint. That's 'cause it's protocol, Nick. You know, protocol? Anyways, I ran the address. It's Derek the Boot's house. Place is filled with Loaded Dice. That's a bike gang. Is it? They still have the right to have a party. Look, I got complaints. That would be plural, so, I mean, what's the matter, man? Huh? You got some friends up in there? I'll take the west side of the alley. Dick! Yo, cops! Damn! Man 1 : Ah, get out of here! Man 2 : Let's go inside! Man 1 : Let's get the hell out of here! Man 3 : They got us surrounded, guys! Man 4 : Whoa! Hey, there! Have a beer! Join the party! Who's the resident? It's his birthday. Yeah, we're not doing anything wrong. Can you get him for us, please? Now! Yeah, okay. Woman : Come on, guys, relax! JM : Back off. Whoo! (Partiers cheering) See, look, guys, relax! Have some fun! All right, girls, settle down. Please back off. All right? Back up! This doesn't need to be difficult! Back up! What's the problem? We need you to turn your music down, sir! What's wrong with the music? We just told you it's too loud! Shut it off! It's my birthday, man! Come down, sir! For what? Sir, I don't wanna yell at you. Come down so we can talk! f*ck! Back up! Just back off! (All shouting) Just back off! Hey, it's my birthday, man! Hey, this is not a discussion, sir. You got that right! Hey, hey. Sir, we're not here to bust up your party. We had a noise complaint. We have to respond. It's my birthday party. It's the middle of the f*cking afternoon! Leave me the f*ck alone! Hey! Watch your mouth, dickwad! Get off my property! When I say back up, I mean back up! Everybody, back up! I said get the f*ck off my property! Get off my property! Get off my property. Nick : You're under arrest! You're under arrest! Happy birthday, asshole! Stay back! (All shouting) Back up! Back up! (Groaning) Back off! It's his birthday! His mother's here, for Christ's sake! Hey! Get your hands off of him! Back up! Back up! I will make you eat this, I swear to God! Stop them! Nice nose. I'm still prettier than you. Stop them! Some fried chicken! Fried chicken! Bitch! Fried chicken! Go! Back off! JM : Out of my way! Stay back! Don't come near me! Don't come near me! Shut up! Shut up! Quit kicking! Shake it, boys! Shake it! Whoo! (Partiers cheering) sh1t. Bill : Yeah! Keep going! Hey, wait! Wait! That's my ma! Ma! Hey, Bruno, pick her up! Shut your ugly ass up! She'll get run over if you don't stop that sh1t, you hear me? 19-2, we need backup! (Car honking) Hey, I gotta know about my mother. Yeah! Can you check on my mother, please? Yeah, yeah! We'll get right on it. Sit at the end of the counter, sir. He wants to call his mom. Nick, a minute? Yeah! What happened to you guys? Birthday party. You're not going solo. It's not gonna happen, all right? He's the commander. He wants to keep you with Chartier. You sure Bambi's not stooling on me? I don't know. Your desk is right there. If they're talking, you'd know. They're not talking. Chartier says he's not. I believe him. I don't like the guy, but he's not like that. I told you he's a good cop. I still know Gendron's planning on getting rid of me, though. Listen, Nick, the guy's a politician. Stop lipping off, he'll find someone else to pick on. No, he's not moving on. Who isn't? Him or you? Who's the one looking for a fight? Harvey :  He's the brass, Nick. You can't win. The job's not like it used to be. You can't make your own calls no more. You can't kick in doors, give a wife beater what he deserves. Nobody trusts us. Sure, when they need you, they give you a pat on the head like you're a dog that's done something good. I'm no dog. Goddamn politicians are all over us now. Stay off the guy's radar, okay? Stop getting in his face. This isn't like the old days. You're gonna have to do things his way. Right. Be a good dog. Just be a good cop! Is there a difference? (Man talking, indistinct) Woman on radio :  We have a child in a car in the parking lot at 2700 Durocher. The caller says it's been there  more than an hour. Ah, man, how long is this going to take? I don't know. Man : What do you want us to do? Inside out, vacuum the carpet? (Cell ringing) Yeah? Hey! Um, Theo's in the hospital. Is he okay? He was playing soccer. He hurt his arm. It's not serious. He's in the hospital! It's gotta be serious! Nick, I have a rape victim in 10 minutes. I feel terrible, but I can't go. Okay, what hospital? St. Francis. I'll let you know. Thank you! My kid broke his arm. Ah, sh1t! (Man talking, indistinct) Audrey : Hi, there! Hey! So I hear you're joining our squad! That's the plan! That'll be great! Yeah! Tyler : Oh, look! A clown car with some real clowns in it! Hey, you like that? Dig in! Hey, Audrey! Hey! Come on! What, like you don't look? She's not married. Hey, Nick, why don't you mind your own business? Hmm? Hey, go see your kid. I logged you out for lunch. Thanks. You're on solo until he gets back. Wash the goddamn car! It's a disgrace! Yes, sir. That's three of us solo. Three! This is bullshit, sir! You know it's welfare day, right? What am I supposed to do? I don't have the men! I don't know. Don't put out the cars, then. Don't worry about me. I'm looking forward to it. Way to go, hero. I told you. You should've asked them to look at it. No, I'll be fine. I gotta get back on shift. I'll drop you off at Nicole's. She'll take you till Mom's off. Nah, I have to go to school. No, you don't. It's okay. You know what? Screw it! Let's go to the amusement park, ride a roller coaster. I'll call in sick. You can't! You can't take off. It's the first of the month. What do you know about that? You know, welfare day. I really do have to go back, though. We have a presentation in science, and Guillaume's gonna look like an idiot if they make him try and do it by himself, so... Guillaume is an idiot. (Chuckling) 
 
 Woman on radio :  In 19, apparently, someone has stolen a garbage truck. JM :  Full or empty? Apparently full. Stolen while the driver was paying for gas. Beatrice :  Who the hell steals garbage? JM :  I'm sort of thinking they wanted the truck. Tyler : What would they do with a garbage truck? Maybe they're dumping sh1t in the river. Toxic waste. Beatrice : The sh1t Vince puts in his hair? (JM laughing on radio) JM :  Oh! (Car honking) Hey, hello! Hey! Hi. There's a guy in the Laundromat with no clothes on. Ah, jeez! It's really disgusting! Okay, hold on. Go, go, go. Just get past him. Yeah. Have fun! Hi, there! Everything all right? Sir, where are your clothes? In here? Yeah. I think these will do for now. Put them on. They're damp. Walk around for a little while, they'll dry. You know what? All of these are dry. (Cell ringing) (Line ringing) Yeah? Barron. I'm back on. At the precinct. Come pick me up. All right. Yeah, I'll be there in 10 minutes. Okay. (Laughing) Hey! Hey! Hey! Pull your pants-- Get 'em up! Come on! You think this is funny? You're going in the back of a police car. Is that funny? Put your hands behind your back. Put 'em behind your back! Move! How's your kid? Is he all right? Good. Good. You don't know how to use a car wash? It's great to have you back. Hey, what's this? I picked up a naked guy in a Laundromat. He's still got his pants off. Ah, sh1t! We'll let booking handle him. He must have got his hands in front. Hey! You make a mess back there, I'll make a mess out of you, my friend. You hear me? Huh? Put your clothes on! Gonna have to wash the outside and the inside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Funny! Whoa, whoa, whoa! (Siren beeping) Hey! Hey! Stop! Shut it off! Shut it down! She steals my money! She takes my whole cheque! You drink your whole cheque! Well, then give me my goddamn beer! Is that too much to ask? Look. We're gonna need you to come down from there, all right? She's having me evicted. Where am I gonna go? We'll figure something out. Just come down, please. Ben : Are you his landlord? He's 2 months behind. You can't get them out. Like cockroaches! Easy! Watch your step. Sir? Sir? Put your hands in front of you like this, please? You got someplace to go? We'll help you figure something out, okay? I just want my beer. I could go for one of those myself, right now. Let's go. So just take it easy, all right, guys? ♪ 
♪ ♪ I was having trouble with that earlier. Feet can't reach the pedals? You realize you're shorter than me, right? There's a car wash down the street. Let me in! Please, God! Aaah! Let me in! Please, God! Hey, hey, hey! Ma'am! Calm down! Stay away from me! We're here to help. Tell us what's wrong. Don't touch me! We won't touch you. Hey! It's okay! No, no! It's okay! Let me in the car. Absolutely! Don't touch me! I'm gonna help you in the car, okay? Nice and easy. Don't touch! I'm gonna put you in the car. We need an ambulance at Ottawa and Shannon. No! You can't do that. Don't touch me! Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? You don't have to be so rough with her! Woman : Don't! Don't! No! I'm sorry! The ambulance is coming. Come on! You're twice her size, buddy! Don't touch me! Ben : Keep moving. Get out of here! Keep moving! No! That's not necessary! What are you doing, buddy? Keep moving! Move along. Come on, let us do our jobs. I'm filming you guys. I'm telling you to let us do our job! Keep moving. Don't touch me! Get in the car. (Woman screaming) (Siren wailing in distance) Okay, okay. You okay? (Siren wailing) Man : What's your address, ma'am? You good for drinks tonight? God, man! Are you kidding me? I'm still hurting from last night. Well, you gotta build up your tolerance, bro. That's the point. Ooh! You like that? I always fall for straight girls. Yeah, me too. All right, people. Night shift is down 3 cars. I need overtime. I want money. I'm in. All right. JM, you ride with him? I can't! I told you, I got plans. I need you. Your name's been at the top of the list for a week. (Sighing) No! I need 48 hours notice. I'll give you notice, Brouillard. You wanna play work-to-rule? I'll grieve your ass every day. Sorry! I have an engagement. Vince, you're riding with me. Chartier? Yeah, I can take a solo. No solos tonight. Nick, I need bodies. Help me out? Yeah. All right, that's 2 cars. Bear, you and Tyler can take a car? You got it, sarge. Thank you. Jesus Christ, Bear. Thanks for asking. I'm not gonna ask! Well, guess who's buying dinner? Buy your own dinner! (Chuckling) Hey. Take 'em. (Bell tolling) Man on radio : 1421 Papineau. We'll look into it. We'll check a little further up, and we'll come back. I kept my cool, though, didn't I? That's not every day someone's mother comes after you with a crow bar! (Both laughing) I hope not! But we dealt with it, though. We didn't have to hurt nobody. Which probably means we'll have to be back there next Friday. Still not sure you're in it for the long haul? Woman : Two bodies behind a supermarket. Come on, man! It'll take more than that. Nick. What? Two bodies behind a supermarket. Yeah, we'll never get the car washed. Woman 2 on radio :  Two individuals need medical attention right away. (Men and women talking, indistinct) Man 3 : Watch it there! Watch it! Woman 3 : Any ID? Man 4 : Hey, Jimmy, give me a hand. At least they don't stink! Come on! Man 5 on radio :  70-45. I'm on it. Man 4 : All right, this area's good. Man 3 : Yeah, we're gonna get on that. Woman 3 : I don't have a clear photo of the girl. What are you looking for? See what I can see. Double ODs? Yeah, it looks like it. Needle's still in her leg. Which is why we should hand it off to the coroner. No, homicide's gonna wanna see this. They should be here already. I'm gonna get some fresh air. You look tired. (Sighing) I'm on a double. See anything? The baggies are different. The ones over here are all mostly the same, but the one over there, it's different. I can't find any other pink ones. Maybe it's a bad batch. It was for them. We should go away on a weekend. I know a great spa near Quebec City. I think you'd like it. I got Theo on the weekends. Well, not every weekend. I'm not much of a spa guy. Maybe something else. Forensics says we can cover the bodies. (Man on radio, indistinct) And don't moon, it's pathetic. I'm not mooning. I'm planning. Woman on radio :  Copy. I'll make the call now. Hi, Nicole, it's Isabelle. Um, I'm running behind. Any chance you can stop by my place for a bit? ♪ 
♪ ♪ (Investigators talking, indistinct) And how old are they? Audrey : 19? Yeah, can't be more than that. It's sad. I don't have a choice, Nick. You want me to leave him alone all night? Take him home with you! Again! It kind of never stops with those two. This has gotta stop. Oh, Ben can ride solo. No solos on welfare day. He's your son. Stop dumping him every 5 minutes. I'm not dumping him. I'm asking his father to look after him. Nick : Don't do that. It's not about wanting to spend time with Theo or not. It's about respecting what we agreed. I can't leave! I have to hand off to homicide! It's not even a f*cking homicide! That's up to them. Man on radio :  21-6, we're on our way. We just left Notre Dame, heading north. What is your problem? Is this a joke to you? That is your police car, goddammit! You get it cleaned now! Excuse me! There's a lady inside! What about her? She fell down. She won't get up. She's pregnant! Should we call for an ambulance? Go! Man : Yeah! Hi! Ma'am, are you okay? Mm-mmm. Do you need us to call you an ambulance? No, I'm fine. Have you hurt yourself? No. Then why are you lying on the ground? I fainted, but I'm better now. Okay, okay, well, let us help you up. I don't wanna get up! Then we need to call you an ambulance. I think that's the best idea. No! Help me up! Okay, nice and easy. All right, we got you. (Woman whimpering) I can't sell that. It's ruined. You wanna press charges? No, I want her to pay for it. If I could pay for it, I wouldn't have to stick it up my dress. That's why I passed out. It was so cold. I never realized. Look, someone's paying for it. Otherwise, I'm gonna make a charge. Yeah. How much? 40 bucks. She'll need a bag. It was pretty funny when she gave birth to a Christmas turkey though. "Ma'am, we've done the ultrasound. We regret to inform the baby is a turkey." "And it's 22 pounds." "But, doctor, is it a boy or a girl?" "No, it's a damn turkey!" (Both Laughing) How pissed was the guy, too? How could he not find that even a little bit funny? (Cell ringing) Yeah. Nick, you have to help me! (Crying) He's lost it this time! Okay, okay. We'll be right there. Let me in! (Banging) Justine, I said open the f*cking door! Justine! Justine! Straight ahead. Go! Where are we going? Rosemount. Just go! (Siren wailing) Dammit! (Justine crying) Justine, let me in, baby. (Banging) Justine! Justine, open the door, okay? Let me in. You don't want me getting upset out here, now, do you? Open the f*cking door! (JM growling) (Siren wailing) You like talking on the phone, do ya? Who were you talking to, huh? Let's see this! Who? Who? Who? (Growling) Please don't! You wanna talk on the phone, huh? Who you talking to? Who you talking to? ♪ Hey! You wanna hit someone? Hit me! It's okay! It's okay! (Wailing) Hey, hey, hey!

I don't know what happened. (Crying) Look... I don't know what happened, all right? I don't know what happened! I just lost control! I just... Oh, I'm sorry! I don't know what-- I'm not gonna do it again. I just need a little help! I just need some help, okay? And I can't lose my job over this, man! Lose your job? You're going to jail, you son of a bitch! Whoa, man! Just-- Ben : What, are you stupid? No, no, no. He can't go to jail, Nick! He's a cop! Justine-- You have to promise me. You can't let him. Justine, what are you talking about?

Yes, he can! No! Nick, you promised you wouldn't say anything. Nick! I won't help you! I'll say I was attacked in the park! Okay! All right! Settle down. (Crying) Just take it easy, okay? We can't.
