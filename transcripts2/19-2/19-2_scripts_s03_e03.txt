 Previously on  19-2... 
 Your cousin pissed some people off pretty badly. 
 He was buried in the basement  of an abandoned house. 
 What's in his mouth? 
 Concrete. 
 Homicide didn't even tell me tell me, they held it back, sons of bitches. 
 Is this a group home? 
 Yes, it is. 
 There's a shed over there and it's like some kids have been using it as a clubhouse of some sort. If anybody decides to come forward anonymously, gimme a call. Get me out of that shithole and I'll tell you all about it. There must be a better place for the girl somewhere. Well, there isn't. Well, she's got an uncle. If he didn't get custody, there's a reason. Congratulations to patrolman  Richard Dulac,  who faced his first real sh1t show and didn't make a fool of himself. Pouliot, you're with me. I'm in the sergeant van again? Yeah. I'll see you outside. The only thing you know how to do is drink and bullshit people, am I right? But many of them do recover, if they have the capacity  to be honest. If you don't mind me asking, ma'am, I'm not quite clear on what you're doing here. You don't need to be. You don't remember me. Charlie Figo. He's a crook. Looks like he's mobbed up. Homicide is not gonna... They don't know. Nick's not gonna do anything stupid. Not on my watch. I could hear best from the vent. Like a grown man's screams. Sounded like some kind of animal after a while. (Kaz screaming) (cell phone ringing) Yeah, just a second. Let me step away. What's that about? He's supposed to be conducting an interview. They're showing her photos. One detective can handle it. Someone brings you a witness, you'd think they'd let you observe. Get you a coffee. (sighing) Are you sure? Look at them all. We're not in a rush. She's been here four hours already. How much longer is this gonna take? OK, I'm calling it. This can be the last stack for today. Excuse me, I said I'm calling it. This is voluntary. When can you bring her back? You can contact me with some proposed times. What's going on? Girl's done for today. How about we bring some food in, take a break? Let's go, Martine. Did she ID someone? Nope. We're done. I'm not having her go through every mugshot they have. Did you look at a guy named Charlie Figo? Excuse me? It's just a hunch. The guy was strutting around my cousin's funeral, acting like he knew something. Could you at least just show her a picture? I can pull a mugshot. Figo, F-i-g-o. Owns the Fortuna. Oh, I know who he is. We'd like to show the girl one more line-up, if that's alright. One. What are you doing? No. I don't know anyone. And we're done. Sorry. No luck. Worth a try. ♪ [Copy, 19-2.] Hey. Almond milk, right? You didn't have to do that. That's what good partners do. (Beatrice scoffs.) We are still partners, right? Take it easy there, Rook. Cutting it close there, boys. That's how we roll, Mama Bear. Chartier-Barron, 19-2, lunch at noon, foot patrol at 4. Pouliot-Dulac, 19-7, lunch at 1, foot patrol at 5. Tyler, you're on solo, lunch at 1. What you grinning at, Rookie? He's not riding with you. No beautiful faces? Not today. Be safe out there. Tyler, I'm looking at you. Don't burn your eyes, girl. Good question, though, Richard. Good question. Nice parking, asshole. I thought I'd gotten somewhere. Kid played me like a book. You don't know that. Pretty sure. Well, you tried, it didn't work. There's nothing you can do. Am find a place for her? Yeah. Stay away from it. I'm serious, listen. Homicide's just itching for an excuse. [All available units, we've got a fight in progress,  balcony behind 2700 Richelieu.] 192, we got that. (people shouting, dog barking) 19-2, we're on scene, 2700 Richelieu. [That's a copy.] f*ck me. What's going on here? They're trying to kill my dog with chicken bones! Calm down, we'll come up and take statements. It's been barking since 4 o'clock in the morning! Nice bone for you. Bitch! You bitch! Calm down. Get back inside. Stop it with the bones already! That's enough. Stop it. (everyone shouting) Hey, hey, hey! That's enough! That's enough! Gimme those. Gimme the bones. Take that, asshole! Stop resisting! Stop resisting! (everyone shouting) Hey! Police! Stop what you're doing right now! (everyone shouting) Stop! Really?! Chicken. Get used to it. (sniffing) (Audrey sighs.) I'm so goddamn bored. Yeah, it's Monday afternoon. It's not exactly high-crime time. Look at this guy. Let's bust him. Nah, let him be. There's some tents up in HoMa. We could go roust 'em. That is so depressing. Yeah. You're right. I was just trying to help. See you in a bit. Yeah. Dickie. Hey. Hey. How's it going riding with the rook? I haven't had to change his diapers. Ha. Yet. Ha. No, but seriously, you feel OK? You good? What the hell is that? Well, I just mean... I don't think you should be stuck with a newbie. What, you think I can't take care of him? I'm not thinking about him. Nice. Well, I'm doing real well, Nick, thanks for asking. Heard you boys had a long day today. Yeah, we did, Sarge, I mean... But thank Christ Richard showed up. Saved us one chicken bone at a time. Yeah, why don't you just piss off, Chartier? What's that? Out of line, rookie! Stand up for yourself, Dickie! Grow some balls, Dickie! Grow a 'stache! I can't tell you guys apart! That won't work. You won't be able to see it. We can draw one on. We can draw one on. Oh, hold on, hold on. Perfect. Uh-oh! Stop resisting! Where did that come from? Give him a break, give him a break. He's had a long day. Now tell me who hurt you so Mama Bear can go beat 'em up. Alright, be good, children. I'm gonna catch you. Grab a beer? I gotta pick up Theo. Next time. You sure? I'm very sure. Going once, twice... alright. OK, we need a cop in here or something. Coming! I already called your boss. You can't do the deck this week. Some asshole from the city's holding up the permit, so... You're Theo's father, aren't you? I am so sorry. No, it's fine. It's fine. No, it's not, actually. Can I offer you a drink, at least? Sure, why not? Oh my God, this looks so good. Where'd you learn to cook like that? Your mom? (laughing) Hell no. Your ex? Last time I checked, a man can learn to cook by himself, Am. He doesn't need a woman to teach him. Totally. No sh1t. It was your ex, wasn't it? Yeah, we... we took a couple classes together. Mm-hmm. Why, you jealous? Grateful. This isn't the most multicultural neighbourhood. Yeah, I know. I grew up, like, ten minutes from here. Really? In the suburbs? First Côtedes-Neiges, then we moved out here when I was 14. Thank you. Wow. You must've made it into all the high school brochures. (laughing) I guess you could say that. It gave me the skills I needed to take advantage of all the beautiful women who thought I was their gardener. (laughing) We probably went to the same high school. No, I think you'd know if we did. So Nick's done with Martine, correct? Yeah, he should be. Should? Nick and should don't go together. I know. This isn't about Nick. I shouldn't have brought her in. She couldn't identify anybody. It's a dead end. Yeah, he's done with her. And Kaz? (cell phone buzzing) Aw, dammit. This is not gonna be good news. Amélie de Grace. Yeah. Hang on one second, I'm just gonna go... Well, I'm sure  you're gonna want to take Theo home. I doubt these two have actually done any homework. (laughing) You're probably right. Let's go. Oh, we're still on for that date, though, right? He's joking. No, I'm not. He is. Nice girlfriend, son. Yeah. Did you get any homework done? Yeah, it was... it was chemistry. Oh, I'm sure it was. What about the mother, Claire? What's her story? Dad, really? Sorry about this. You kidding? You saved me a trip. What's up? We're about to find that out. Do you mind hanging out with Martine for a bit? Could be a while. Mmhmm. Martine, you remember Ben? How bad is it? She bit someone. sh1t. I pulled her out before it went in her file. I knew she was yours. Can I get the Wi-Fi code? It's on the fridge. Um... You hungry? Always. Well, she's got KD. You want some KD? I'll have some of that. How come there are no pictures of you? You hungry or not? Other one. Can you... can you stop fussing, please? Yeah. Sorry. Are you thinking about your hazing? Ha! Nah. The way Tyler keeps talking about it, it's bound to be a disappointment. Yeah, you keep telling yourself that, Rook. Hey, your turn to buy. Still? Right. I talked to a friend at the SQ who was working the task force and I asked him what they have on Kaz. And did you get an answer? Well, apparently Homicide's got a confession. Did your friend see it? Do you know who it is? No. No, and don't go asking either. We'll find out who it is when they press charges. They're working it. Oh, they're working it. They're working it. Leave it alone. OK. Taco salad. Um, actually, you know what? I feel more like... maybe like chicken. I don't know why. (laughing) Chicken. Chicken. OK. Thank you! [All units, we have an armed robbery in progress... ] Come on! Come back! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Goddamn it, Rookie! What's up? Shut up! [Robbery, 2400 Boyer, black suspect in a blue hoodie running south on foot. He's armed.] I'm right there. [19-37, we're coming down St-Urbain.] I got him, I got him! I got him. 19-4. Got a visual. He's in the alley between Brébeuf and De la Roche. I'm in pursuit. [19-7, we're on De la Roche.] sh1t. 19-7, head south to Rachel, see if you can box him in. Copy that. [The alleys end at Bureau.] Copy that, 19-4. [19-4, do you have a visual?] Negative. He must have cut through someone's yard or something. sh1t. 19-2, converge at Bureau and Brébeuf. 19-2, we got that. (siren blaring) There, there, there! We got him. 19-7, we got him. In an alley heading north to Rachel. Where is he? I don't know. He can't be far. [19-7, we lost contact. Think he may head to Parc La Fontaine.] Beatrice : [I'm in the park. All cars converge towards Rachel.] Where are you, asshole? Huh? There, there, there, there! You see him? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. There! Tyler : [I got him, I got him!] Go, go, go, go, go! 19-7, he's heading to Parc La Fontaine. Tyler : [Dulac, do you have him?] [He's in the park.] [Do you have him?] [No. He's in the park.] [All units, seal the park.] [19-2, we're on Papineau, two minutes away.] Hey, you. Sorry? Come here a sec. [19-37, seal the park at Rachel and Papineau.] [Copy that.] You seen a black guy walk by here a minute ago? Jeans, blue hoodie? Black guy ran by here about three or four minutes ago, but he wasn't wearing no hoodie. Oh yeah? What was he wearing? Jeans, uh... black high tops, green shirt, some kind of logo on it. Gimme your gun. Gimme your f*cking gun. (laughing) You're the one in control here. Shut the f*ck up and hand it over, alright? [19-2, one minute out.] Bear, you got something? Bear, are you there? Jesus Christ. This is 19-4, we got a 10-7 on the south end of Parc La Fontaine. [I repeat: a 10-7 on the south end of Parc La Fontaine.] Hurry up! You in some kind of trouble? Put your hand on your holster and slide it out slowly. Do it now! Do it now! I'm not asking again, OK? Hang on. Hang on. Hurry up! (laughing) Coming, it's coming. You see it? [197, switch to channel 4.] Don't move. (breathing heavily) OK. OK, yeah. We got this. We got this. Dulac! sh1t! Don't move. Don't move. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. No sh1t. Oh... OK. OK. I see how it is. Is this the best you can do? What the f*ck? Ha, ha, ha! Is that the best you got, Tyler? Really? Jesus Christ. Dulac, get back! Get back! Come on! Who even is that? Gendron? Get down! Get down! Officer down! Officer down! We're gonna need an ambulance! [Copy that. Officer down at Parc La Fontaine.] Hey Rookie, you stay with us. Look at me. Look at me. Tyler, are you OK? Yeah. I'm good. Guy shot Dulac. Where's the shooter? That way. Let's go. Assailant is armed and dangerous, on foot, heading north in Parc La Fontaine. White, 5'9, jeans, white t-shirt, gray hoodie. Officers in pursuit. 
 
 (sirens blaring) Don't lose this guy, Tyler. [All units, keep it in the park. We need someone at the southwest corner.] Bullet just grazed him. He's gonna be fine. Then I need you back out there now. We gotta find this guy. Audrey, go! He's got my gun. [19-37, still no sign of him.] [Hold your position, 19-37.] You're gonna be OK, Rookie. Sarge, I'm so sorry. I thought it was my hazing. I f*cked up so bad. What are you talking about? The guy. I saw it was a toy gun. I just... What gun? The guy... the guy's gun. We're gonna shift him up now. [19-2, what's your position?] We're in the park heading north. [Copy.] [47-6, holding at Sherbrooke,  no sign of him.] [Copy that.] Goddamn rookie. f*ck, you're thinking too much. [19-4, any sign of him?] Look at this guy. Is that him? Is that him? Pull over, pull over, pull over. I surrender! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get the f*cking gun now! On the ground! Where's the gun? I surrender. Where's the gun? I surrender. You like shooting at cops, you son of a bitch? Huh? You like shooting at f*cking cops? Did I kill him? The cop. Did I kill him? 192, we've got the shooter in custody. I'll do it right next time! What d'you say? What did you f*cking say? (laughing) Get in there! Piece of sh1t! (sighing) I mean... What was she supposed to do? She had a gun to her head. Toy gun. She didn't know that. I know, but it just... kind of makes it worse, right? She gave up her weapon. Word from the hospital is he's gonna be OK. He out of ICU yet? Never had to go in. Oh, thank God. How's Bear? She's still with the suits. You good? Yeah. Did you see his gun? No. I mean, a glimpse, I guess. It was pressed against my head, I was afraid to move. Of course. Did you wonder why he wanted your gun when he had his own? So I couldn't shoot him. That's what made sense at the time. So you gave him your gun. And? He shot a cop with it. Heard about today. How's the rookie? Good. Could be back to work in a couple days. Glad to hear it. You coming from downtown? You wondering about the sergeant? Nobody's gonna blame her for this. That's good to know. Something else you wanna ask me? No. You got any connection to Homicide? Not really. They hate us about as much as everybody else. Why? Murder case. Heard they got a confession, wanted to check it out. You got some balls on you, Barron. Worth a try. Sorry. They shrinking? No. Nothing's shrinking. So how come you're not asking Homicide? 'Cause I had some run-ins with some of the dicks working on it. Guess you could say they don't really like me much either. Elise Roberge. Nick. Ma'am. You gonna be in 19 long? Forget I asked. Have a nice day, Elise. Mm-hmm. We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past, nor wish to shut the door on it. We will comprehend the word "serenity" and we will know peace, no matter how far down the scale we have gone. We will see how our experiences can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. Nick! Hi! Can I come in? Uh... Yeah, is everything OK? Everything's fine. Is Allie home? Uh... no. (moaning and gasping) What is it? Open it. You're an asshole. What are you talking about? You said you needed a permit. You know, I'm perfectly aware that I behaved like an idiot the first time we met. You don't need to rub it in my face. (moaning and panting) Claire, I didn't do this to make you feel bad. I was down at City Hall on a call and I have a buddy who owes me a favour. That's it, that's all. (scoffing) Look, I know we didn't get off to a great start, but when I picked up Theo from here, he talked more on the way home than he has in years. Well, he is a teenager. (moaning and panting) Your daughter's really bringing my son out of his shell. And to me, that's a relationship worth cultivating. (panting) (cell phone buzzing) What? No, no, just hang on, I... Yeah, no, just give me a half hour. OK. OK, bye. What is it? It's Martine. She ran away. I had to put her in a shithole. sh1t. She's got a social worker. Yeah, like six hours away. OK. OK. I'm up. Let's go. No, just go back to bed, it's fine. No, it's OK. I'm not gonna find her tonight. I'm just gonna make some calls. I need to make some calls. You're a good boyfriend, Ben Chartier. I'll be back. I'll be waiting. (siren blaring) 19-2, we're taking a noise complaint. Leaving the vehicle. [Copy, 19-2.] You're lying to Dispatch now? Everybody does it. Here, I gotta show you something. Put that in. What's this? It's the confession. Your cousin. I got a copy. From where? I told you, a guy at the SQ owes me. Well, he owed me. He's done with me now. You wanna see it? No sh1t I wanna see it. Thought you told me not to poke my nose in this. You were gonna listen? So this is you keeping me out of trouble. It's me trying to keep you out of trouble. Ah. Have you looked at this? Yeah. Yeah, you gotta see it for yourself, though. Who is he? A serial arsonist. He definitely burned the house down. And he says he killed Kaz? That's what he says. Here. [So you like to burn things?] [How many times are you gonna ask me that?] [You've burned things before. This time you killed someone.] [That's right.] [Who was he?] [I don't know. He came in while I was working. He got me upset.] [And so you killed him.] [That's right.] [Not the first time either.] [Not the first time you killed someone.] [Let's talk about this man that you killed in the basement. What did he look like?] [He was black. He was bald.] [Do you know his name?] [Cassie.] [He told you that?] [I read it in the newspaper.] He's lying. This is bullshit. Yeah, it's a false confession. They know that. So why are you showing it to me? You needed to see it. Watch them railroad the poor fucker. I wouldn't put it past them. No, Nick, they're working this. I've been trying to tell you this the entire time... And you know that 'cause what, huh? Some prick in the SQ told you? No. The same f*cking assholes who said that I was the mole? No, I know it because it's true. You have to trust them. You gotta trust them to do their job here. Why would someone do that? I don't know. Confess to something they didn't do. I don't know, I just know that it happens. (sighing) Thanks anyway. Mm-hmm. 19-2, we're back on. Hey. They found Martine. OK. Yeah, she was at her uncle's. He called it in to child services. Good for him. Yeah, I guess. The guy did eleven months for assault. I mean, it's the only instance of violence in his file, but... Should bring a cop with you. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Want me to put my uniform on? Definitely not. You sure? Yeah. Hi. Hi. You're the, uh, new social worker? Amélie de Grace. Frank Ferney. This is Officer Chartier. Did you have to bring the cops? I mean, I called you. He's not here to do anything. OK, no problem. I'm just, uh... just trying to keep her out of trouble, you know? Mm-hmm. She's down here. She's a good kid, but I knew she was spinning a story when she told me her social worker signed off. I wanna do this right. I've already started taking my PRIDE course. Good for you. I'm planning on moving all that stuff out, paint it yellow, so that won't be a problem. She'd have her own room. I told you I wouldn't stay there. And I told you that meant lockup. You need to go get your things. Come on, Martine, let's go. The lady's trying to... trying to help you. (scoffing) No, she's not. She wants to put me away, she doesn't give a sh1t. Young lady. It's fine, let her finish. Not one person at any of those places you people have shoved me into has ever given the tiniest dribble of a sh1t. I have family. Why can't I be here? 'Cause you know better? Are you done? Does it matter? You'll never let me. That's something we need to talk about, but that's not gonna happen right now. Right now I'm going to lockup, I get it. I'll get my sh1t. Martine, that's enough. Lady's trying to do her job. What would your mother say if she heard you talk like that? Don't you talk about my mother! Stop acting up! Go pack your things! Let's calm down, please. Sorry. sh1t, uh... Still reintegrating, you know? When did you get out? A while ago. Yeah, I'm just finishing up my parole this month. I'm on the straight and narrow 100%. You... you gotta tell me what I gotta do, 'cause you guys put families together, right? Flesh and blood? Yeah, that's a key considera... Flesh and blood doesn't mean you're fit to be a parent. She brings in a cheque, yeah? That's part of it? You don't know me. OK, thank you, Officer Chartier. I think I can take it from here. Maybe you wanna wait for us outside. Of course. Thank you. Sorry about that. Yeah. (He clears his throat.) Just put your bag in the back. Wanna go back inside and say goodbye? Yeah. Take your time. You can't go shooting your mouth off like that. You said you wanted a cop. To back me up, Ben. That girl is attached to her uncle. If I go playing hard ass with him, I'm gonna lose her trust. Blood may be thicker than water, but that just means that they can screw you up more. If you let 'em. Hey. What happens to her now? She goes to lockup, like she said. Till I can place her. At least it'll be safe. Do you qualify as an emergency bed? I need a five-point check. I can do that. Are you sure you don't mind? What's it gonna be, two days? Probably. Whatever it is. Hey. Come on in, it's ready for you. Thanks. I'll be fine. Something I can do for you? Get in. (Tyler clears his throat.) Did you talk to her yet? I tried. You? Nah, I'm giving her some space. She gonna lose those stripes, though. You don't know that. Fall in. Come on, people, I said fall in! Let's go. You heard the sergeant. Hey, you two seen Chartier? No. Maybe he's late. Chartier? He's never late. No, he's not. Why am I here? You keep in touch with your friends at the SQ? A couple people. Well, you must be pretty close if they're willing to risk charges for you. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't play dumb, country boy. We know what you've been doing. I'm assuming you understand the stakes here. There are an array of serious charges that could be laid against you for violating chain of evidence. It was a false confession. How would you know that? Look, we figure your partner asked you to poke around, see what kindof trouble he's in. Answer is a lot. I should talk to a lawyer. No, you don't wanna do that. Am I being charged? Why? What have you done? Am I being charged? This isn't about you, Chartier. This is about Nick Barron. You're riding with a guy you don't wanna be associated with. Are you asking me to rat on my partner? You've done it before. It's not happening. You back him up, makes you just as guilty as he is. Yeah. Yeah, um... If I'm being charged, I'll need a lawyer. If not, I'd like to leave now. f*ck with our investigation again... and we won't have a choice. OK. (Pilcher): I hope you're hearing this, Chartier. (Bouchard): Be seeing ya. So they knew about the confession. They started listing charges. Well, it was false, so no harm no foul. They're all over you. They're all over you. OK, well, I'm not gonna f*ck with Homicide. Awesome. Good. I buy that. I believe you. That's actually all you do, is piss people off. If they're not getting killed. Whoa. Hey, I said I get it. You don't get it. You don't get it. Don't say you get it. You don't even realize that you're the biggest problem in this investigation. Whoa, whoa... Walking around, waving a f*cking red flag. They tied your cousin to a murder and you clammed up about it. Now your cousin's dead and you're still not cooperating. What are they gonna see when they look at you? You'll just get more people hurt. I know, I gotta... I gotta drop it... f*ck you. You are so full of sh1t. You are so full... No, I know! I know, Ben, OK? I don't... I don't know what's wrong with me, alright? Everything I touch turns to sh1t. Goddamn right it does. That's it, OK? I swear I'm done. That's it. OK. OK. Yeah. OK? You gotta believe me. Mm-hmm. That's it, Ben. I'd like to. I'm trying to. Hey, son. I thought you and Allie were going to a movie after practice. What happened? We broke up. Why, did you two have a fight? No, it's just... her mom hates me. Her mom hates you? sh1t. I'm so sorry, son. It's got nothing to do with you.
