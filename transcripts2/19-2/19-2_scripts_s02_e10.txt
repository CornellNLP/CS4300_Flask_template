 Previously on  19-2... 
 If the officer is found to have shown wilful misconduct, her contract with the Montreal police will be terminated. 
 The department is offering you two months' paid leave. 
 He didn't want to be lying to you. 
 Don't. Just let it be. 
 Job's not like it used to be. Can't kick in doors, give some wife beater what he deserves. Nobody trusts us. 
 (gunshot) 
 He knew my f*cking name. 
 You pick the guy up,  two days later he's dead... and it turns out your cousin's involved. 
 Right now it seems to me you're lying to protect your partner. 
 So what happened? 
 I don't know. 
 He killed the guy, Nick. 
 It's Chartier. I have a lead on the mole. Call me back. 
 I'll file for a warrant. 
 I told you it wasn't Nick. 
 Do you think I'm ever gonna trust you? 
 I didn't touch that little girl. 
 The beast didn't wake. 
 Nick... 
 We know. 
 Sergeant Julien Houle is the subject of a national arrest warrant. 
 He's facing charges of public corruption, possession and distribution of child pornography. 
 Search warrants are being executed on his business offices and his home as we speak. 
 Forensics will be clearing his office today. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 This has gotta be some kind of joke or something. 
 Come on, you guys are playing a joke on the rookie, you gotta let me in on this sh1t. 
 The sergeant has been allegedly leaking information to organized crime. 
 So... now he's a pedophile? Come on, come on, guys, guys! 
 We know this guy, right? Right? I mean... 
 Based on what? Please. What evidence? 
 We rescued one of his victims. She was 12 years old. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 Hamelin, you'll be acting sergeant. 
 Nick. Nick's senior. 
 I don't want it. Let her have it. 
 OK. 
 I know this comes as a shock to all of us. 
 I would ask you to, uh... take it easy out there. Just... get through the day. 
 Alright. 
 0 Duos: Brouillard and Dulac. 
 No, no, sorry. 
 Just give me a solo, alright, please, until Audrey gets back. 
 OK. Brouillard, 19-21. 
 Tyler, you'll take care of the rookie? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Today's beautiful faces... 
 ♪ 
 Will Investigator Dawson please call 205? 
 Any word? 
 Nothing yet. 
 Last credit card hit was yesterday, same for his phone. 
 Um... 
 Thank you. 
 N-19, traffic lights are out at René-Lévesque and Papineau. 
 That'll be a mess. 
 Tyler, Dulac, you wanna take that, please. 
 19-4 responding. 
 What's that? 
 It's an SQ scanner app. It'll pick up anything code 2 or higher. 
 In case they find him. 
 Someone will. 
 Where's he gonna go? 
 You hear anything from Homicide yet? 
 No, you? 
 What about your cousin, you hear anything from him? 
 No. 
 32-6, on our way. 
 He's gone, forget about him. 
 He killed the guy, Nick. 
 I know. 
 I was there. 
 So I wanted to see if the SQ... 
 You sh1tting me right now? 
 They didn't, and... 
 What the f*ck were you thinking? 
 What were you thinking? 
 I wasn't. 
 Yeah, no sh1t! You brought Cass? 
 I needed someone to keep an eye out. 
 Jesus Christ, you and your cousin, man... 
 Cass is the one who found the kiddie p0rn, and that's... that's when I got stupid. 
 That's when you got stupid. 
 You didn't see what I saw! 
 You shouldn't have seen anything, Nick! 
 I lost my head, alright? I admit that. 
 How'd it happen? 
 The guy recognized Cass, Cass freaked and... sh1t went down before I knew what was happening. 
 How'd he know Cass? 
 He knew all about me. 
 He threatened Isabelle, threatened Audrey... even threatened Amélie too. 
 You got your smoking gun now, huh, Bambi? 
 You gonna use it? 
 Hey. 
 Bear? 
 Hey, Audrey. 
 You haven't heard. 
 Haven't heard what? 
 What's going on? 
 And you didn't see the news. 
 No, I don't watch the news anymore. 
 You don't smoke. 
 Not for a long time. 
 What you doing here? 
 Trying to get back on. 
 And I just heard about Houle. 
 f*cked up, ain't it? 
 The one guy you think has got his sh1t together. 
 Need a lift? 
 No, I got my car. 
 Yeah, you best stay out of this. 
 Take the paid vacay. 
 I want my gun. 
 I got you. 
 I can probably talk to some people. 
 Union guys. 
 Thanks. 
 No problem. 
 Where is he? 
 Cass? I don't know. 
 You're full of sh1t. You've been covering for him this entire time. 
 I saw him once, I told him to get out of town. 
 Oh, good! Good work! 
 What the f*ck was I supposed to do, turn myself in? 
 You better tell me where he is. Where'd he run to? 
 He didn't run. 
 Then where is he? 
 Just 'cause nobody found the body. 
 (muffled conversation) 
 I had no idea. You understand. 
 Well, do you think you should've suspected Sergeant Houle? 
 Absolutely, yes. 
 And were you close, personally? 
 I can take Sandrine with me. 
 Go with Julien. 
 It's OK. Go, Sandrine. 
 Commander? 
 Were you close? 
 For a time, yes, when... when my wife was sick. 
 ♪ 
 You're not gonna see that girl. 
 So what is it? 
 It's Nick. 
 What about Nick? 
 Take a walk? 
 Know his cousin Cass? 
 Yes, I've met him years ago. 
 He's a bit of a crook, right? 
 He's more than a crook. 
 What, did something happen? 
 Cass killed a guy. 
 What? 
 What guy? 
 The guy who had the girl we brought in. The pedophile. 
 Jesus. 
 And Nick's involved? 
 Do the police know? 
 There's a warrant out for Cass. There's no evidence linking Nick. 
 Tell me what Nick did. 
 He says Cass killed him. Nick didn't see it coming. 
 Do you believe him? 
 Should I? 
 Yes. 
 Am? 
 Yes. 
 This guy who got killed... I work with the victims. 
 I'm not gonna cry, you understand? 
 So what? 
 So he's my partner. 
 Makes me a part of it. 
 I told Amélie about Cass. 
 You tell her I was there? 
 Yep. 
 So like a little bitch, you go tattling to my sister. 
 That's not your business. 
 I trusted you here. 
 Then trust me. 
 So why'd you feel she needs to know? 
 She didn't, I did. 
 Needed someone to tell me you're not just screwing with me. 
 Excuse me? 
 What? 
 No, f*ck that. You have no high ground on me there, Chartier. 
 Oh no? 
 I was just telling you the truth. 
 Yeah, that's after you lied to me, let me lie to Homicide. 
 'Cause I didn't want to get you involved. 
 Only you did. 
 That's right. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 So now you're involved. 
 You're an asshole. 
 N-19, we have two complaints of a homeless man relieving himself in a backyard. 
 19-7, number one or number two? 
 I told her she could trust you. Where's this backyard? 
 Hutchison, south of Van Horne. 
 19-2, we got it. 
 Hey there. 
 Hi. Um, I tried to talk to him, but he was... he was pretty confused. 
 OK. 
 Right there. 
 Thanks. Stay here. 
 OK. 
 Hey there. 
 You alright, sir? 
 I can't find my house. 
 I'm trying to go home. 
 OK. 
 OK, well, let us help you, OK? 
 Just come on with us. 
 Put you in the car, where it's nice and warm. 
 What's your name, sir? 
 Harold Krune. 
 Uh, this is Montreal police. 
 We just picked up one of your residents, Harold Krune. 
 We're bringing him back now. 
 Excuse me? 
 Alright, I understand. Yeah. 
 They won't take him. We gotta take him to the hospital. 
 Is that their call? 
 Yeah, pretty much, if they can't look after him. 
 Check Social Services, see if he has any family. 
 He's got a daughter. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Oh sh1t, that's messed up. 
 What? 
 She was charged with neglect. She wasn't feeding him. 
 He was 61 pounds when Social Services took him away. 
 Jesus. 
 Some people. 
 (electronic signal) 
 Hey, they got a hit on Houle's cell phone. 
 Where? 
 South Shore. 
 Let's go. 
 Joseph. 
 Bring it back to me. 
 They locate Houle? 
 He triangulated his cell. He's in Longueuil. 
 (beeping) Goddamn it. 
 They found his cell, it's in a garbage truck. Dead end. 
 Aw, sh1t. 
 Why did we cross the bridge? 
 We're taking you to the hospital. 
 Hospital? Where? 
 Don't worry, sir, we'll turn around soon. 
 (doorbell) 
 I got it. 
 OK. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Sorry I'm early. Is it OK? 
 No, it's OK. Come on in. 
 No, no, just... 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, keep your shoes on. 
 Ok. 
 Wow! Nice place. 
 Oh, yeah. Thanks. 
 Not bad, eh? 
 Yeah. 
 Hi! 
 Hi. 
 I'm Audrey. I've heard so much about you. 
 Oh! 
 Well, welcome. 
 Thanks. 
 Um... well, come in. 
 I made some tea. 
 Thanks. 
 I can make coffee if you want. 
 No, tea's... tea's... 
 No, tea is lovely. 
 OK. 
 I... I'd have a coffee. Please. 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 Let's go, right this way. 
 Over there? 
 Thank you so much for doing this. 
 My pleasure. 
 I set up an appointment with the Union. 
 Yeah? 
 I mean, I gotta be straight with you... 
 That's good. 
 Good, yeah? 
 OK. Sorry. And uh, we're gonna have to educate some of these old timers, you know? 
 They're not gonna understand what social media is doing to us and... 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, and what it is doing to you in particular. 
 So... these are the forms. 
 Oof. I have to fill that? 
 Yes. 
 It's OK, I'll help you with it. And uh, just... 
 Two sightings, east of Kingston. 
 He's got family in the area. 
 Thousand Islands. 
 Pretty easy to cross over into New York State from there. 
 That's our thinking. 
 Well, thanks for keeping me in the loop. 
 Yeah. You earned it. 
 So that's why you wanted to see me? 
 Just being friendly. 
 Any idea what spooked him? 
 No. No, I've been trying to figure that out. 
 You said you saw him with a kid. That tipped you. 
 You say anything? 
 Not a word. 
 No word. 
 I know. We got a scanner going. 
 Apparently I'm the last person he talked to. 
 What did he say? 
 He told me to be there for the squad. He knew. 
 He was already planning to run. 
 Yeah. He would've known the walls were closing in. 
 Figure that's why he'd stick it on Nick. 
 Speaking of Nick, uh... is there any movement on the Tremblay thing? 
 I'm not involved. It's Montreal Homicide. 
 We don't play well together. 
 You heard Cassie Clement's involved? 
 We did. 
 So what does that mean for Nick? 
 Ask Homicide. 
 We're done with him, if that's what you're asking. 
 Good to know. 
 Chartier figured it out. 
 I thought it was the SQ. 
 (sighing) 
 He was working with them. 
 I know. 
 This squad's got a lot of problems. 
 But you're not one of them. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, thank you. It was nice to meet you. 
 Yeah. You too. 
 And thank you for taking the time to... 
 No, don't worry about it. 
 I don't know about you, but I think we're ready for them. 
 We'll meet with the Union, so I'll see you Monday morning. 
 Alright, thank you. 
 Take it easy. 
 Have a good night. 
 Yeah, you too. 
 What's your problem? 
 You have to bring her into my home? 
 She's my partner. 
 Oh, I get it. 
 Oh, Jesus Christ, Justine. 
 She's suspended, I'm the union rep... I gotta help her out. 
 I bet you do. 
 I don't want to do this. 
 Tell me the truth. 
 Let's not do this. Let's just not do it. 
 Tell me the truth. 
 Shut it down, Justine. 
 Now. Just shut it down, now. 
 You jack off to her, huh? 
 You picture her in your head? 
 f*ck! Yeah, I jack off to her! 
 ♪ 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Crying: Nick... 
 What's going on? 
 He... 
 Justine. 
 Nick... 
 OK, OK. 
 I'll be right there. I'll be right there. 
 (sighing) 
 sh1t. 
 Justine! 
 Justine! 
 (sobbing) 
 Justine... Oh God, Justine. Oh God. 
 Justine. Justine. 
 Oh God. Oh... 
 Oh God. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 You're home late. 
 I don't feel like sleeping. 
 They didn't find Houle? 
 Trying not to read into you being here too much. 
 Don't. Could've let myself in. 
 Should've. 
 Didn't feel right. 
 So what are you doing here, Amélie? 
 Figuring out if I'm done with you. 
 ♪ 
 You're gonna kill me with that. 
 You're gonna kill me with that bat. 
 You're gonna f*cking kill me with that bat, Nick! 
 (He drops the bat.) 
 Hit me. 
 (grunting) Ah! Yeah! 
 f*cking hit me! 
 (grunting) 
 ♪ 
 Sir? 
 It's OK, the doctor said I could go home. 
 OK, let me check this. 
 It's not in your file. 
 Yeah, well, I'm going home. 
 Jean-Marc Brouillard? 
 You're gonna have to come with us. 
 Patrolman Brouillard has been charged  with aggravated assault with further charges pending. 
 Suspended without pay. 
 For assaulting who? 
 His wife. She came forward. 
 He may have also been involved in another altercation. 
 That may also have repercussions. 
 Obviously there'll be some transfers coming in. 
 For the moment, the other shifts will cover on rotation. 
 Well, we need to appoint a new Union rep to replace JM. 
 I can do it. 
 Anyone object? 
 I gotta call Audrey. 
 What'd you do to JM? 
 What he deserved. 
 I was gonna call you, but I figured you'd just try and stop me. 
 Nah, I wouldn't have. 
 SQ says Houle has family between Brockville and Kingston. 
 Could just hop the river over into New York State. 
 Nah. Nah. 
 You don't think? 
 Nah, he wouldn't go home. Not where he's known. 
 Cares too much what people think. 
 N-19, we have a report of a dead body in a basement, result of a fall. 
 (siren) 19-2, we got that. 
 Copy, 19-2. 
 (door buzzing) 
 Commander. 
 Didn't expect to see you here. 
 You got something worked out? 
 Well, first of all, I need you to make a full statement, in detail, what you did and what was done to you. 
 What was done to me? 
 The truth. 
 I know. 
 (chuckling) 
 Well, sorry, sir. 
 I fell. 
 Oh, jeez. 
 That's the guy we picked up yesterday. Mr. Krune. 
 Is that your dad? 
 He doesn't live here anymore. 
 He... he had to go to... a facility. 
 You better wait upstairs. 
 We can confirm one fatality. We're gonna need transport. 
 Copy, 19-2. Two minutes. 
 Looks like he was trying to crawl through the window, slipped, fell, got stuck, maybe knocked himself out. 
 Yeah. 
 Poor bugger. 
 So sad. 
 SQ says you're cleared. 
 What about Homicide? 
 Don't know. 
 You think you can go home... and then it's gone. 
 It's not there. 
 Remember what we said, huh? 
 What happens in the car... 
 Stays in the car. 
 Good. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You see Audrey? 
 Yeah. 
 How'd she take it? 
 Not so great. 
 I bet. 
 What about him? What's gonna happen to him? 
 Union will get him a lawyer, ask for some counselling. 
 Maybe they have a Wife Beaters Anonymous. 
 That's not funny. 
 Alright, alright. 
 Hey, those stripes look good on you. Why don't you put in for 'em? 
 You trying to get rid of me? 
 No, no, hell no. Nah, it'd break my heart, girl. 
 Besides, it's just me and you holding this place together, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 "Mm-hmm". 
 Just keep walking. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Yeah. 
 Hold on. 
 Listen to me. 
 OK. Got it. 
 What's up? 
 That was him. 
 He wants to meet with me. 
 Said where he was? 
 Let's take my jeep. 
 Barron, my office, now. 
 I'm off shift, sir. 
 I said now! 
 I'm sorry, sir, but I have a family emergency. 
 I know what you did to Brouillard, and I'm gonna see that you pay for it. 
 JM say something? 
 I don't need JM. 
 I have a witness. You're suspended immediately. 
 It's a real healthy squad you got yourself, Commander. 
 Testament to the quality of your leadership. 
 You're finished as a cop! 
 You're going after Nick? Have you lost your mind? 
 He's outta control! 
 Well, look around you! Who isn't? 
 Get your sh1t together or get yourself another posting. 
 He's losing his sh1t. 
 The commander. 
 Screw him. 
 You're not a little bit worried? 
 I got other stuff to worry about. 
 Get on the 15 North taking off the Island. 
 Where is he? 
 Some hunting lodge. 
 Said he wants us to text him when we get close, make sure we're alone. 
 Did he say he's gonna surrender? 
 Why, you wanna hand it over to the suits? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 ♪ 
 You ever get a hunch about him? 
 __ 
 No. 
 (beeping) 
 OK, turn right, then next dirt road on the left. 
 (birds cawing) 
 Gun. 
 Stay where you are, that's close enough. Stay where you are. 
 Put it down, Sarge. 
 I know what I did. 
 Do I look like a priest? 
 I'm not asking for forgiveness. 
 What are you doing, Sarge? 
 It's gotta come to an end, Nick. I know that. 
 Don't. 
 Lower that gun! 
 I can't do that. 
 Drop the f*cking gun! 
 Don't shoot him, Ben. That's what he wants. 
 Stand your ground, Officer! 
 Take the f*cking gun off him right now! 
 Back! 
 That's the only reason we're out here, right, Sarge? 
 'Cause you don't have the stones to do it yourself. 
 Should be you, Nick. 
 Should be a lot of people. 
 I put it on you. 
 I used your codes. 
 You got cops killed. 
 Yeah. 
 (sighing) 
 Nick... 
 Let it go! Let it go! 
 No. 
 Nick, Nick... 
 No. 
 I hurt so many people. You know what's right. 
 Nick! You know what's right. 
 No. 
 Please. 
 Nick, the things I've done... it's gotta end. 
 Please. 
 Nick, I'm a f*cking cop. 
 Nick. 
 There are two kinds, Nick. Them and us. 
 No matter what we've done. 
 What are we doing? 
 Nick... 
 He's a cop. 
 (gunshot) 
 Where do you wanna go? 
 Just drive.
