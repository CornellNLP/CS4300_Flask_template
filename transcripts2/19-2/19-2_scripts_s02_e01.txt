 Previously on 19-2... 
 Sergeant Houle, Ben Chartier. Just transferred in from Provincial Police. Houle : Chartier, you will be riding 19-2 with Barron. Nick : For Christ's sake, Houle, I'm not in the mood to play tour guide to the hick. Nick is better off alone, trust me. I trust you, Sergeant. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same way about Barron. Nick : Houle wants me solo. Why? 'Cause I don't want to be stuck on a team with you, Bambi. You don't want to work with me, that's fine. I sure as hell don't want to be stuck with you. Houle : Give him a chance. Whatever he's like, it's not personal. What's with the bitch? She's my wife. You said you'd come with me. You hate it there. I want a divorce. Did I ever tell you the SQ came to see me, asking questions about Nick after Harvey got shot? You are a hell of a partner, aren't you! You sure Harvey didn't shoot himself just to get away from you? (guns firing) Oh! You don't know anything. He's not fit for duty. Shouldn't have been cleared. ...Let me see your hands! Drop it. Walk away or die. Why do you feel a need to protect this guy? He's my partner. You should call him. What the hell happened in there? Nick : Someone messed up. I hear things aren't too rosy with you and Nick Barron. It's nothing I can't handle, sir. Well, I'm glad to hear it, 'cause I think you've been a positive influence on Nick, and I'd like to see it continue. Gendron quashed your transfer. Any idea why? Thinks we make a good team. Hey, it's your dad. I know it's late, I just, uh... I love you. I want to be here with you. I made a mistake. I'm so sorry. Isabelle : A file on Nick? He is involved, he is your husband, and no one is going to approve you for lieutenant until that's all wrapped up. Anything we say to you in this room is restricted. We have a mole in 19. Our original theory was that Jean-Pierre Harvey was the mole. Now the most likely suspect is Nick Barron. - We need a cop that we can trust to do the right thing. You're that guy. You ready, Bambi? (police radio chattering) woman : What took you so long? We came as fast as we could, ma'am. Is Animal Services here yet? Nobody's here, we've just been waiting. 19-2, we need a 20 on Animal Services at Castro Towers, called one out 30 minutes ago. dispatcher :  40 minutes to an hour. Nick : Outstanding. All right, show us where. OK. Keep an eye on them, will you? Nick : The building manager here? He's only here on Mondays... sometimes. You got a phone number? I can get that for you. It was just there, right in the middle of nap time. Everyone was on their mats. I was sure it was going to bite Leontha. How big is it? Oh, my God, I don't know. Huge. Know where it went? No idea, I just got everyone out. Look at this. OK. Could have gone down there. Maybe. I'll seal it up. I can get that phone number for you. Please. Somebody looking for a snake, officer? Who are you? Just a concerned citizen, trying to help. Snake's downstairs. Just thought you might wanna know. Nick : Kazzie Clement. Nick. So what brings you around? I was just trying to help the boys in blue. You know me. Help? Yeah, help get rid of us. (chuckling) Come on, I'll show you. Do that. Down here. Know this guy? Long time ago. What's his deal? Crime. This lady was doing her laundry and saw it go over there. 19-2, we got another sighting of the snake, we're moving into the basement. Animal control ever going to show up? No updates. After you. Ben : Uh-oh. Oh, Jesus! sh1t! f*ck! Look at the size of that thing! Why don't you go get us a laundry bag or something? Where the f*ck am I going to find a laundry bag? Watch your mouth! Hey, just get him something, will you? He's packing. Who's packing? Your friend. He's not my friend. I don't care what he is. He's got a gun. Just watch that snake. I'll watch the snake. Damn. Geeze! (chatting inaudibly) The hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? What, are you going to let him walk? What are we doing here? I warned him. That's good, you warned him. Look, this is Castro. People get stupid. Come on. It's a legal gun. Not to carry! 19, we have a report of vandalism at Vigier High School. 19-2, we're at Castro, en route. That's two blocks away. 19-2, tell animal services we've got the snake. Copy, 19-2. - You have to hold this bag  open, I'll put him inside. I think you got this. (theme music playing) Apparently someone smashed up a computer system in the main office. 19-2, we're on sight. Copy. She's in a hurry. (gunshots) 19-2, we have shots fired inside Vigier High School. We have an 888 inside Vigier High School, I repeat, multiple shots fired. We're on pursuit. Copy, 19-2. Don't move! Hands, don't move! I'm the janitor, I'm the janitor. The guy's inside. He's got a gun. He's shooting-- What does he look like? What is he wearing? He's got a black aut. It's a ball cap. Go! Get the hell outta here! Go, go! sh1t! Anyone in the area, we've got possible vandalism... Hands! Hands! We just work here. With at least one victim inside of the school, you should use the west entrance, we have it open. Where is he? Where is he? I-I don't know. Get on, go, go! ...multiple reports coming in. Leave it open! (gunshot) (crowd screaming) We gotta go, we gotta go. Everybody out, everybody out, now! (gunshot) (people screaming) That way! That way, go! Where is he? Where is he? (gunshot) The shooter is in the cafeteria. ...officers responding and ambulances... (gunshots) (people screaming) Ben, cover me. You can go, you can go. 33 is mobilized, patrol is en route. 33-4, we're en route. Ben : Vector 2, I have eyes on the shooter. He's wearing a black ball cap, black sweatshirt. He has an assault rifle. 19-24 on Beaumarché... We're in the cafeteria. You got a shot? No, you? Get traffic out of the school! Have you got him pinned down? No, there's multiple exits. Nick : You good? Ben : I'm good. (students crying) Drop your weapon! (gun firing repeatedly) Ben : Drop your weapon! Nick : You don't have to do this. Just put the gun down. Put the f*cking gun down! We're here to help you. dispatcher :  All units, clear channel 1 for triple 8 call. All units clear channel 1. Nick : Put it down! Ben : You're f*cking surrounded, put down the gun! We're here to help you! No, no, no! No, no, no. No, no! Houle : What's going on, guys? Ben :  The shooter is taking hostages, I repeat, he's in the back of the cafeteria by the kitchen. The shooter has hostages. No, don't... Don't you shoot her! Don't shoot her! (student sobbing) Ahh! 19-28, we're on site, unconfirmed reports of gunshots in the gym. Nick : How many shooters? Not confirmed. We have reports of gunshots  in multiple locations in the school. Nick : Ugh... What are you up to, son? Huh? What are you going to do? What are you going to do here? (gun firing) (students screaming) Just put the damn thing down! You know it's the right thing to do, OK? (sirens blaring) Just put it down, we're here to help you. This is not gonna end well. You're surrounded. There's nowhere to go. There's no way out of here. 33-4, we're  outside the main doors, we have the entrance secured. Houle : The shooter is in the cafeteria, try to contain him. Which way do we go? I don't know. No one is saying the same thing. Let's get it together, guys. Ben : You've gotta go. You've gotta go. Hey! Listen to me, son. Listen to me. All you gotta do is put the gun down. Put it down, we're here to help you. OK? (footsteps running) My name's Nick. I told you. I'm here to help you. What's your name? (gun firing) f*ck! Come on, son, you gotta... You gotta talk to me. (rattling) What are they doing? What... What are they doing? (clanking) Ben : He's moving, exiting the back of the cafeteria... Let him go! ...into the kitchen, he's got three hostages he's using as human shields. I repeat, the shooter is exiting the cafeteria into the kitchen. Houle : Do not lose contact with the shooter. 19-1, I will take command on  site. Minutes away. Tactical is delayed but en route. Nick : Don't do this! Hey, hey, yeah... 19-8, we're looking for an entrance to the kitchen... Nick : Let 'em go! Let them go! Put the gun down, it's over. You got nowhere to go. There's only one way this is going to end. All right? Now let us help you. (gun firing) Vince : Sir, the exit behind me, go! We're clear. Come on! 19-12, we'll back you up in the kitchen. Where are you? Ben : Watch your left. 19-24, we're just outside. Open the door, it's locked. Houle :  19-24, negative. Find another way in. - Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. Where does this go? Come here! Look at me. Where does this go? I think... west hall. The west hall? We believe the shooter is in the west hall. We need some guidance, here. We have floor plans on site. I'm almost there. We have casualties in the kitchen, we need paramedics. dispatcher :  Units en route. - Go after the shooter! Hold up. Jesus. Hey! No, no. We don't know where he is. Might be another shooter. Come on. Have we confirmed multiple shooters? Negative. - We gotta go, we gotta go. Go. Vince : Leave the victims. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at me. Look at me. Did you see where he went?

Go out the back! We got a young girl down at the southeast entrance. Houle : Do you have contact with the shooter? Negative, negative. There's kids everywhere. First priority is to neutralize the threat. Find him. Beatrice : Where? Where do we go? Don't lose sight of the shooter. Tyler! Tyler, breathe. Come on, you got this. Bring it! Stairs. Now, come on. Move! (helicopter whirring overhead) The outside perimeter is now secure. Keep moving, guys, go! Beatrice : We're on the second floor, we'll take a different hallway. Kids, the exit, the kitchen, now. Go! Check this here. Check it here! (door opening and closing) Houle :  19-2, do you have the suspect in sight? Beatrice : No for the second floor.

Ugh, sh1t! (gun firing) Houle : Leave them, find the shooter! Where are you? I don't f*cking know! This main street needs to be closed off in both directions. Make sure paramedics have access to the north entrance. There are three more ambulances en route. Hold on. Anything? Still waiting to get into the office. We need access to the school cameras. There's a god damn radio station broadcasting live Tweets from inside the school. Oh, you're kidding me. The kids inside. They're talking to each other. The school offices are secured.

Room 259 is clear, about 20 students and a teacher. (door closing) OK? It's chained shut. The shooter f*cking with us, gotta be. Stairway's been chained shut around room 260, we'll need bolt cutters.
