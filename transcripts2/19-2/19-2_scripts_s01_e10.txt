 Previously on 19-2. 
 What the hell happened? 
 The place was booby-trapped. 
 The guys inside started shooting. 
 We got cops down. 
 I don't do monogamous relationships. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 It's not even your business. 
 I work with the guy! 
 We were gonna tell you. 
 (Both grunting) 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 Audrey : Liar. 
 She's my wife. 
 You're an asshole! 
 Isabelle : Let me tell you what happened. 
 Audrey's alive. She's a fighter. Let's stay focused. 
 Houle : She should not have been riding solo. 
 She's a f*cking mess! 
 (Young man laughing on video) 
 Another notch in your belt, huh, Nick? 
 Who's next? 
 (Birds chirping) 
 Mmm! 
 You said this was a boring neighbourhood. 
 Uh-huh. 
 It's not. 
 How so? 
 There's 2 kids casing B & E's right down there. 
 There's lots of stuff going on around here. 
 There's a booze can letting out right down there. 
 That's a rave. 
 Right. 
 You see this guy down here on his cell phone? 
 Yeah. 
 About a minute from now, he'll be shooting up in the alley right there. 
 How do you know that? 
 'Cause he's not the first customer this morning. 
 Uh-oh! There he goes. 
 Well, you're not as dumb as you look. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, how dumb do I look? 
 (Laughing) 
 Show me more! 
 (EKG monitor beeping and ventilator hissing) 
 Woman on PA :  Dr. London to the ER. 
 Hmm! It's for the backsplash. 
 Hmm! Perfect! 
 (Laughing) 
 You hate it! 
 Only in my kitchen. 
 You know what? 
 It's actually a good thing we can't live together. 
 How would we decorate? 
 (Sighing) 
 And what makes you think we can't live together? 
 All right, keeping your options open. I get it. 
 Hey, that's over. 
 Is it? 
 I told you. 
 I choose you. 
 (Sighing) 
 They're keeping her in a coma. 
 Officer on police radio : 34-6. We're coming up to De Lorimier. 
 For how long? 
 Well, at least she's stable. 
 Yeah, stable in a coma. Great! 
 Man on radio :  In 19, we have a domestic dispute  at 1532 Prince Louis Boulevard. 
 19-2. We're on it. 
 You don't think I understand? You don't think I get it? 
 Sir, calm down. 
 This isn't about you. Okay? It's about him. 
 He's done with me. He's gonna kick me out! 
 He brought home another lover! 
 He is not my lover! 
 You're a liar! 
 You think that I don't know? 
 All right! That's enough! Both of you, shut up! 
 I'll go. 
 Good! Go! 
 Don't you dare, Bruno! 
 All right, stop! I said shut up! 
 Now, sit down, all of you. 
 You guys like to keep us coming back here. 
 What's the problem this time? 
 He is. 
 That is so unfair! 
 Bruno is my ex-lover, and he's homeless, and I told him that he could stay with us until he gets his feet under him. 
 Is this your place? 
 It's my name on the lease. 
 Then he decides who stays. 
 This is my home! 
 I am not trying to replace you. 
 Ben : You need to smarten up. 
 You can't have the cops being called every time you have an argument. 
 Now, can we handle this like adults? 
 Of course! 
 Good! Then, do it. Hurry up! 
 It's just for a couple of days. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Richard, I love you, OK? 
 I am trying to help a friend. Can't you accept that? 
 Forget it! I'll find somewhere else-- 
 No, no! 
 (Sighing) 
 You can stay. I'm sorry. 
 For a few days. 
 You see, Bruno? It's fine. 
 I promise that we will keep our voices down from now on. 
 Nick : If we have to come back, we're laying charges. 
 Play nice. 
 Whispering : Thank you! 
 Woman on radio : The incident happened in SQ jurisdiction. 
 Can you advise them and let me know as soon as you're clear? Man : 44. That's a negative... (Car honking) Is there any chance of putting a solo on that? (Keyboard clicking) Woman : I don't have any solos. Don't worry about it. Brake. Brake! Tyler, brake! You guys OK? Yeah. You sure? (Sighing) Yeah. You guys can go home. It's OK. Thank you. What the f*ck is wrong with you? Give me the keys. Give me the goddamn keys! You son of a bitch! You think they'll make it as a couple? Weekly noise complaints aren't the most promising sign. Yeah, but they care, though. You can see it. Woman on radio :  OK, copy that. That's not always enough. How do you feel about Amélie's thing? What thing? Open relationships. Are we talking about this now? I guess we are! Man :  32-12. Did my message get through? I'm cool with it. Woman :  Yes, it's 1201 Ouellette. You're cool with her having a boyfriend? Everything's out in the open. We're both grown-ups. (Nick scoffing) Well, you're not exactly one to judge, are you? A little bit of self-loathing there? Man on radio : In 19, we have a reported fatality. 1532 Prince Louis Boulevard. Are you f*cking kidding me? 19-2. We're on it. f*ck! Copy, 19-2. (Siren wailing) Male officer : Did anyone get inside the building? (Female officer talking, indistinct) Go around the side and see if... Jumper? Yeah, 6th floor. We were just there. Domestic disturbance. Oh sh1t! No, the disturbance was between these two. The guy who jumped sat and stared at his feet. I checked his ID. Outpatient at the Allen. Depression. It's gonna look bad in the reports, Nick. People jump. For Christ's sakes, we clean up bodies all the time. Are we under arrest? We're gonna have to bring you in to get a statement. I didn't see what happened. I heard somebody screaming outside. I wanted him out. This is my fault! He's never gonna forgive me! You don't know that. I cheat on him. I can't help it. How is he ever gonna trust me? Then stop. (Cell phone ringing) Yeah. Give me your keys! Bear. I need your ride. What's going on? Is it Audrey? (Tires screeching) Isabelle : Where's he going? (Siren wailing) And what the hell happened to your car? A dog ran into the road. Tyler hit the brakes. We clipped a fence. I'll file the paperwork as soon as we get back to the station. (Nick sighing) (Crying) ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ (Woman on PA, indistinct) Fall in, guys. Right away, please. (Men talking, indistinct) Fall in! Patrolman Jean-Pierre Harvey died today as a result of injuries sustained while on duty at this precinct. (♪ Man singing rock ballad on sound system ♪) Thanks, Marie. Thanks, Marie. Beatrice : Look at him! He's gotta stop. I can't keep carrying him. Houle : Hey, Nick's on leave. I'm putting you with JM. OK? No more solos. OK. It could be worse. You could be stuck with JM. JM : Listen up! (JM whistling) Come on, listen up! Nick should really be saying this. Whatever, he's not here. Harvey didn't deserve to go out the way he did, but it could've happened to any one of us. To Harvey! All : To Harvey! Hey, man, that was good of you,  toasting Harvey like that. Yeah, well, he's still a cop, right? What do you mean? Well, the guy gets shot in the head, everybody starts to treat him like a saint. Truth is, he wasn't. Far from it. I heard he was a good cop. That's what I just said. Now he's a martyr. Suddenly, everybody forgets he was a drunken asshole with a gambling problem. Jesus Christ, man! He's not even in the ground yet. It is what it is. Hey! You got the keys? Yeah, I got 'em. I've been thinking about that meth-house sh1t. Man :  14-21. We're on Papineau. We'll look into it. Oh yeah? Yeah. Someone leaked it. Maybe. Maybe? Definitely. Tactical's going apeshit about it. Yeah, I bet. Well, it could be someone who has a girlfriend in dispatch. Maybe an office clerk. Could be. It could be a cop. (Sighing) What is it? It's about the funeral. When? There isn't gonna be one. Harvey's been refused an official service. Honours Board ruled that his death was not directly related to injuries sustained while in service. Are you kidding me? He died with a bullet in his head! Nick, it's bullshit! We know that. Well, I'll fight it. The guy's got his rights. It's a done deal. Insurance denied the claim. Our budget's down to the bone. That's why you put Audrey on solo, right? The budget? No, Nick... No, no, no, no, no! If I'm the one alone in that car, you think that happens? I don't. What the f*ck were you thinking putting her out there? Nick, calm down. I asked to go solo! You're out of line, officer! Harvey deserves a service! He's not gonna get it! And do you know why? Because tainted cops don't get honours! Tainted? Excuse me? What are you talking-- Jesus Christ! He had a lien on his house to a known loan shark! I'll take care of the funeral. And if you show up, I'll throw you out myself. (Man talking, indistinct) Jean-Pierre Harvey, he was my partner. The first time I patrolled with Harvey, he said-- (Sighing) He went out on the street every day! And he ended up like this. Harvey was a good cop. To Harvey! All : To Harvey! To Harvey! Amélie : Harvey always looked out for Nick. He broke Nick's heart, that's what he did. The fallen idol. So they tell me. Nick loved him, though. You still wanna meet up after? I don't know. Depends on Nick. Of course. Probably not tonight, though. Good enough. Hey, hey! Don't leave yet! I have to. (Sighing) All right, well, I'll come by later. That's not gonna work. (Sighing) I need my family, Izzy! I can't be your family, Nick. Look, we'll talk when things are more settled, OK? Oh yeah? When's that? It's not tonight. You're in no shape. Go home. And stop drinking! This is exactly why I'm not doing the marriage thing. (Sighing) Are you still pissed at me? Forget it. Oh, come on, Nick! We've all got secrets. You don't tell me that JM beats the sh1t out of Justine, and I pretend like I don't know. So, I'm dating your partner. Why didn't you just tell me? Because I was afraid to! Shouting : Why? You don't have to be scared of me. I'm-- I'm not! I'm sorry. I'm not. (Sighing) Yeah, OK. Um... (Sniffling) I, uh, I gotta go. Whispering : Please! I've got to go. (Sighing) ♪ ♪ (Woman on PA, indistinct) I'm not on the list! I know. I know. You, uh, you have to be patient. What's going on? Is it because I'm not Major Crimes? It's politics, Isabelle. Tell me. (Sighing) It's because of Nick. I asked around. There's an investigation. I don't know the details. It's a provincial file. Montreal police aren't involved. A file on Nick? I told you I don't know the details, but he is involved. He is your husband, and no one is going to approve you for lieutenant until that's all wrapped up. Nick's a good cop. It's the machine. There's nothing you can do. I'm sorry, Isabelle. I... I did everything I could. I'm sorry. Please. Patience. Hey, Nick, I just wanna say you got some serious balls, man. Yeah, you know, Audrey's in a coma, and you're still horndogging your ex-wife. That's low, man! Even for me! (Sighing) (Sniffling) Man on radio :  28-9. Copy that. Did I ever tell you that SQ came to see me asking questions about Nick after Harvey got shot? So, you tell me, how do you feel about that? Don't start about Nick. You know, you and me don't talk about him at all, all right? Woman on radio : In 19, we have a lobster tank spilled outside a fish market on Rachel East. Man on radio :  19-6. We got it. Ooh! We dodged that one, huh? (Laughing) (Explosion, screaming) f*ck! f*ck! Where did it come from? sh1t! How do I get down there? I don't know, man! Rip a U-ee! (Siren wailing) 19-2. We have an explosion! De la Commune. De la Commune and Prince! (Tires screeching, siren wailing) (Alarm sounding in distance) Woman on radio :  19-2, how close are you to the scene? Confirming car on fire down the off-ramp at De la Commune and Prince. (Alarm sounding in distance) Woman on radio :  19-2, fire and paramedics are en route. Stand by. 
 
 (Men talking, indistinct) Man : You guys meet there! Come on! Give me a hand! Thank you! They'll be scraping him out of there with a spatula. Well, at least he went quick. I'll give you that. Hey! You Chartier? That's right. SQ. We're taking over the scene. I'm gonna have to have that from my superior, sir. You will. What is that about? Hey, man, how are you doing? Chartier. I was in green for 8 years up in Morin Heights. Yeah? I never worked the Laurentians. What's up? The CI got whacked. Ah! Yours or ours? Yours. (Man whistling) Man : Over here! Woman : I'll tell you what I found. (Cell phone ringing) Hello! May I ask why, sir? Understood. (Cell phone beeping) We're done. (Scoffs) Bigwigs! (Cell phone ringing) Yes! Contact him. Thank you! Whispering : Chartier! There's some people at the SQ that wanna talk to you. 8:00 tonight. And keep it to yourself. You wanna tell me what this is about? I'm hoping you'll tell me. Catherine? What's going on? Is everything OK? I wanna be here with you. I made a mistake. I'm so sorry! I wanna make it right. Just like that? (Laughing, crying) (Sniffling) Do you want me here? (Sniffling, crying) Of course, I do. (Sniffling) (Sighing) (Dishes clinking) Where's Theo? He's out. I wanna talk to him. Both of you. It's too late tonight. Bullshit! What is this? Huh? I mean, what kind of rules are you setting for the kid? Nick, you run your house the way you want to and I'll-- This is my house! (Sighing) Look, Theo needs a father. We need to be a family. The other night was a start, Izzy. No! It was a mistake. This whole thing is a mistake. I need to come home! I want a divorce. (Sighing) The papers are ready. I got them last week. You mean right before you slept with me? It should never have happened. I don't know what I was doing. No, you don't know what you're doing. But I know what you need to be doing! This is not the day to do this. No, no, no, no! You don't just say something like that and walk away! You want a divorce? You want a divorce? My answer is no. It's not up to you, Nick! It's not up to me. It's not up to me. This... this is mine. This is my house! Theo : Dad, stop! (Panting) What are you doing? You should go home! (Sniffling) Go home, Nick! So, she's there right now? Yep. You just walked out and you left her there? Well, she's used to being left alone. Yeah, so you think. Yeah, I do. (Sighing) Does she know about me? No. Will she? I don't know. I guess dreams really do come true, huh? It's what you wanted, isn't it? (Scoffing) Yeah. People don't change. We already established that you're not the type who cheats, so... You are a one-woman man. Thanks for not stringing me along. Just like that? Yeah. (Sighing) (Engine starting) (Cell phone ringing) Ben Chartier! Dan Malloy. Nice to see you again. Likewise. Would you mind giving me one second here? Go ahead. Thank you. Hello? Amélie :  Hey, it's me. Hey! Sorry to bother you. Um, I'm at Nick's. He's not here. I talked to Isabelle. She said he's pretty cracked up. Did you talk to him? No, he left his phone here. Um... I don't know. I called Marie's. Um... Maybe you could look for him. Please. Maybe try the cottage or... I gotta stay here. Of course! OK. Thanks. Is everything all right? I'm really sorry. I've gotta take off. Can we do this tomorrow? Yeah, it's OK. Thanks. I'll see you then. (Door closing) Nick? (Sniffling) Nick... (Gun cocking) Don't! (Sighing) Theo... (Sniffling, sighing) I'll just get him hurt too. (Sniffling) God! You don't know how much I want to. (Crying) Nick! Nick! (Panting) Please. Nick! Don't do it. Nick, don't do it. (Panting) Nick, let go. Please. (Sobbing) (Sighing) Are you OK? Yeah. I'm fine. (Gasping, coughing) (EKG monitor beeping rapidly) Hey, nurse? (EKG monitor stops beeping) (Coughing, gasping) Hi there! Hi! What brings you here? I just came by to say thank you for going to see Nick. No problem. You two have met. (Both laughing) Yeah. Amélie was telling me about Nick. Apparently, he's just a big softie inside. (Laughing) That's pretty much how I describe him. Laughing : I should go to work. I have to get your number. Right! What are you doing? Nothing! Relax, I just came by to say thank you. I didn't say anything to her. I like her. Here you go. Thank you. (Phone buttons clicking) Ah, perfect! It was so good to meet you! You too! Mmm! Take care, hon. Bye! Bye! See you around. She likes you. Well, it's, uh, it's my partner's sister. Is there a story there? No, she-- she has a boyfriend. Chuckling : Yeah, she said. (Both chuckling) (Laughing) (Knocking on door) Hey, Dad! Hey! Thanks for coming in. Yeah, sorry about last night. That's no problem. This way. Ben : OK. So what's this about? You were at the meth-house raid, right? On the perimeter. Mm-hmm. A lot of talk about that, huh? Even in the SQ, apparently. So what's the chatter? Um, well, apparently, there's a leak on the force. Mm-hmm. Well, that's why you're here. Anything we say to you in this room is restricted. You are not to discuss it with anyone. Is that clear? That's clear. We have a mole in 19. Bullshit! Hmm... I wish it was. You're fishing. You don't know that. We've been on this for a couple of years. We know. The leak's in 19. You didn't get posted there by accident. I don't understand. We put you there. We've had our eye on you for a little while now. You never wondered how your transfer to Montreal came through so fast? The shooting went away pretty quick too, didn't it? Hmm... What did you spend, one day at a desk? It's like an angel watching over you. Can we stop with the runaround, please? We need a cop that we can trust to do the right thing. You're that guy. No! Hmm! What do you know about the guy from the car? I heard that he was a CI. Hmm... that's a cover story. He was a cop. Long-term UC. Take a look. He's the one that tipped us off to the meth house. Now he's dead. It's not just a coincidence. Three dead cops and counting. What do you want from me? What do you think? You're always complaining... Huh? Did you see the ride they gave us last night? I haven't had a night like that in a while. You slipped? Then you get 10 days off... Go for it! I'll back you up. What don't I get? You will? Of course! Yeah, baby. I was just going around... These are digital files on everyone in 19. The access codes are in the folders. Our original theory was that Jean Pierre Harvey was the mole. The leak seemed to have stopped when he got shot. That's no longer operational. Now the most likely suspect is Nick Barron. Why? He's got a background with known criminals... So? Service record is a mess. You must be realizing by now that your riding with him is not an accident, right? We want you close to him. So, my commander knows about this? We told him where to put you. We didn't tell him why. Still. None of this makes Nick dirty. No. But somebody is. This is the evidence that we used to trace the leak to 19. Take your time. Have a look. You'll see the same thing we do. (All laughing and talking, indistinct) Hey, Mel! You got no choice here, Chartier. You need to do the right thing. Man : Hey, Ben! You ready, Bambi?
