 Previously on  19-2... 
 I don't see how the commander can be held responsible  for the actions of a dirty cop on his watch. 
 Hurry up! 
 Isabelle : The commander and I want to congratulate everyone involved in today's incident. 
 It turns out I can get out of my lease. Oh, Officer! Once you had me in your bed, you wouldn't let me out of there. You've met the station detective there, Latendresse? What do you want, then? Put her in her place. I asked your permission to open an investigation into the leak and you shut me down! You can't win by being right. Detective Isabelle Latendresse is being transferred out of 19. I prefer to call it 29 days of being sober. I'm saying I've seen a lot, bro, and I ain't going back. It's your cousin. We've found him. - They found him  in some abandoned place in Hochelaga that burned down. He was tortured. You gotta come clean, Officer. Are you in too deep yourself? I don't know what your cousin was thinking. Anybody does something like that,  there's gonna be a price to pay, no matter who it was. You trying to say something? Rap sheet looks like he's mobbed up. Walk away, Nick. Walk away. (kids shouting and laughing) Can I help you? Hi, sorry to bother you, ma'am. I'm officer Barron of the Montreal police. Is this a group home? Yes, it is. Well, the property across the lane, the one that burned down? Where they found the body? Yeah, there's a shed over there and it looks like some kids have been using it as, like, a clubhouse of some sort. I don't know anything about that. I just thought maybe I could talk to some of the girls here to see if they might know anything about it. Sure. You got a warrant? It's just a question, it won't take long. Not without a warrant. Whoa, whoa... Let me give you my business card. Maybe... ♪♪♪ Copy, 19-2. (rap music) ♪ They say I'm too gangsta, they say I'm too street ♪ (humming) (cell phone buzzing) Hey, stranger. Yeah, I miss you too. What's up? Right now? Yeah. Um... not really. Hang on a second. OK, yeah. Right on. How long are you gonna be here? Uh-huh. Yeah, I'd love to. Just text me when you're done, OK? OK. He's an old friend. Boyfriend? Yeah, I haven't seen him in years. He was working in Baltimore last time I saw him. And now he's back. Mm-hmm. Now he's back. So he just wants to see you, or... ? He wants to offer me a job, actually. At the new super hospital. Are you really this fragile? Totally cool with it. Mm-hmm. I'm not gonna be that guy. OK, then. Hey, what's the story with Isabelle? What'd she do? She didn't do anything. Gendron just f*cked her over. Well, we all knew he wanted to f*ck her, just not quite like that. Alright, folks, listen up. Must you talk like that? A few reminders. You need a detective, you have to take a trip downtown. When are we getting a new detective in the station? I don't know that we are. That's bullshit. We gotta go downtown every time we need a signature? Joseph and Dulac, you're over gas quota. Keep it in 19. Yes, sir. Anyone home over there? You good? Now, I wanna talk about something serious. The city has a jaywalking problem. No, no joke. (laughter) This is a map of the high-risk intersections in the district. Joe Public's gonna hate us. This is how we turn things around as a team, meeting one productivity goal at a time. And we do have some good news today. (whooping and applause) Uh-oh. Since Officer Chartier landed in 19, he has been all about impact. Two days ago, we saw that impact when he saved that child's life. In the two short years he's been here, he's racked up an impressive amount of merit marks. In fact, he's racked up enough to become a member of the Order of Merit. (cheers and applause) This is from the Chief, straight from the Chief here. "On behalf of the entire department, I would like to offer my personal commendation to Patrolman Ben Chartier. His exemplary work represents policing of the highest order and serves as an example to officers everywhere." Keep it somewhere safe. Thank you. Congratulations. (applauds) Let me see it. Ooh, sweet! So what, you get merit badges from the SQ too? Oh, there he is. And shut up. You know Detective Grou, G-r-o-u, no l-x at the end? What department? Human resources. Wants me to apply for detective. You got headhunted? They do that? I didn't know they did that. You gonna go for it? No. No, man, it's not for me. Good man. Maybe they should spend more time solving cases instead of headhunting. Wanna elaborate? Oh, sh1t. What's in his mouth? Concrete. They poured it down his throat and let it set. Homicide didn't even tell me. They held it back, sons of bitches. How did you get this crime scene report? I got a friend. You... f*ck's sake, Nick. Homicide is not gonna like that. They don't know. Went by the burned down house this morning, Come on! Saw it for myself. Come on! He's my cousin, Ben. I mean, look at the guy. Look at him. I'm not doing anything wrong. No, you did that already. You and Kaz. Look how that turned out. Let's go. Oh... excuse me. Hope you don't mind. I needed some privacy. I won't be long. If you don't mind me asking, ma'am, I'm not quite clear on what you're doing here. You don't need to be. May I ask how long you're gonna be with us? I heard Deputy Chief Morin is taking retirement. It's too bad. He seems like such a decisive guy. Close friend of yours? Yes, I've known him since the academy. He'll be missed. I'll take Latendresse's office, I just need yours for another half hour. Hour, tops. Of course. Jaywalker. Another jaywalker. What are you doing? Nothing. [19-4,] [fight in progress at La Taverne, on Ontario.] Yeah, 19-4 responding. [19-2, we'll back up.] Goddamn rookie. (ruckus) Get the f*ck out! (grunting) Alright, police, break it up! Stay back, ma'am. Break it up! Break it up! (ruckus) Here we go. Calm down. Let's go. Let's go. What the... You stay right there. sh1t! sh1t! sh1t! Tyler, you OK? Are you alright? Yeah. Aw man, look at this. That's like a grand of inventory right there. Should've cut him off sooner. Rookie, you good? Yeah. 19-4, making an arrest. You all good here? Yeah. You sure, big man? Yeah, I'm good. We were good when we worked together. Ah, so we would be working together. We'd both be on the pediatric ward. I'll send you the job posting. Think it over. Yeah, please. It's really nice to see you. Yeah, it's good to see you too. I'm living with someone. Oh. I... didn't think you were interested in doing that. Well... things change. His name's Ben. Cool. [27-7, we're on it.] [32-6, on our way.] (siren warnings) Hey, oh! What is this? Hey! Oh, look at this guy. Aww... Hey! Anger's a secondary emotion, my friend. Anger management 101. You had to do that too? Yeah. Hm! Had some issues before I came out. We use anger to cover up fear, which is a primary emotion. Hey, did you have that brown-haired colored chick? The one who always wanted to make you cry? Yeah! Like she feeds on human tears. Yep. And so, did you cry your eyes out? Hell no. Yeah, me neither. Hey! You wanna watch where you're going? Are you blind or are you trying to hit me? Excuse me? You wanna remember who you're talking to there, sir. You think you own the road? OK, what you wanna do right now is take three deep breaths and really ground yourself before you ever touch a police car again. OK? Like this. (breathing deeply) Breathe in. Alright? Thank you. This is bullshit! (girls laughing) You don't have to put them out on my account. He's a cop, I've seen him before. She's right. My name's Nick Barron. But don't worry, nobody's in any kind of trouble here. You girls know about the shed of that house that burned down? Looks like somebody's been using it as a hangout. Not us. Again, nobody's in any kind of trouble. I just wanna ask you some questions about that house. What happened? Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. Anything? Nothing? (sighing) Alright, well, if anybody decides to come forward anonymously, gimme a call. Come on, take it. Hey. You got one of those for me? How'd it go with your friend? My ex. I know. It's a hell of a job. Tell me. Well, I would get to be a supervisor, and I'd get to pick my own cases and I'd get to make my own hours. Work regular hours. That's like the impossible combination in my line of work. Good. Take it. Take it, I mean it. How's Nick? Homicide called him in. What? He said they treated him like a suspect. Is he... I mean, they don't know anything, do they? No. Yeah, how could they? Kaz was tortured. (sighing) Well, Nick didn't kill anybody. Nick will be OK. As long as he doesn't do anything stupid. Well, he's not gonna do anything stupid, not while you're watching him, right? Not on my watch. (cell phone ringing) I gotta take this. Amélie De Grace. My man. I don't want your money, I want you to go. Go? I just got here. No, you didn't just get here. No! It's time for you to go. OK, alright, I'm sorry. Stop apol... Should we call the cops? He is the cops! No more cops! Just pour me a drink... Don't pour him a drink. Just one drink. Let's get him out of here. Let's go. I'm not drunk! What is... what is wrong with you guys? Good night, bud. What? Come on. OK, OK, OK, OK. Alright. I left my cigarettes at the bar! You're going. My cigarettes are at the bar! You didn't see them? Oh, my God! Aw, man... (cat meowing) Aw, look at the kitty! Look at the kitty! Oh... Oh, man... Ow! sh1t! f*ck! Ah! f*ck! Oh, m*therf*cker. Whoo! (laughing) (laughing) (laughing) Thank you. f*ck. Ow! So this... is what the end of the world looks like. (laughing) Motherfucking zombie apocalypse. (laughing) (grunting) Audrey, come on, tap out. Come on, we know you're tough already. Tap out. Ah! Someday, I'm just gonna break your arm. No, Kim, you won't. I wanna go again. Again? Yeah. 
 
 Hey. You, uh, hear from Tyler? He's not in the lockers? No. He didn't call. How's he doing? With the rookie. Dulac says he's a good mentor. Kid's a good liar. I'll call him. I'll try him too. Tyler's sick today, so Pouliot, you're riding with Dulac. Lucky winners of bike duty. Hey, looking forward to it. Sir? Yeah, I just wanted everyone to understand that just because we're short bodies, it doesn't mean that our productivity goals are reduced. Alright? I need everyone to pitch in and make up for the shortfall. Is that understood? Yes, sir. Is that our new detective? No, that is not our new detective. Carry on. Barron, Chartier, 19-2, lunch... What's the story with Joseph? Sick day. Is he sick? He hasn't missed a day in months, he's due for one. Hey. Don't leave them any wiggle room. They'll exploit it every time. Especially your former partner. Yes, sir. Understood. She talk to you? The inspector? No, is she going to? When she does, I wanna know. And be careful what you say to her. She's the one that had Detective Latendresse transferred out. Alright, Schwartz's, Wilensky's, Romados. What are we doing? I don't care. Alright, Wilensky's it is. You always pick Wilensky's. You love Wilensky's. It's an institution, bruh. I know. Pick somewhere else. I thought you just said you don't care. I don't, just somewhere else. Ah, I see, I see. So I just make all the suggestions while you just sit there and shoot 'em down. No, it's good. We'll go to Wilensky's. Well, obviously we're not going to f*cking Wilensky's now. Just pick a place. We spend half our lunch trying to figure out... OK, I got an idea. I know what we're gonna do. We're gonna alternate days, alright, and whoever decides, no debate, that's it. No debate. Alright. Today's my day. Go get 'em. I don't even know what I want. Look at that. Look at what time it is. It's already 12:25. Pick a spot. Is it 12:25? Is it 12:25? Alright, Wilensky's it is. No shame. He's not even pretending. It's insulting. Look at him! Come on. Where we going? Shut up. Well, there's no shortage of action in 19. What the hell are you doing in 19 anyway? It's where they sent me. Come on, don't bullshit me. I know about you. What do you mean? Your father's a chief inspector. Yeah, but... I don't like to broadcast it. It's too late for that, legacy. It's not so bad. Oh, don't kid yourself. Maybe you weren't here for the whole Houle thing, but you're gonna be tarnished all the same. I actually did meet him a couple times. Houle. Before he... He ate his gun? Yeah. At least he had the decency. Let's bust him for jaywalking. f*ck jaywalking. This is stupid. We need a car. D'you want me to call one? You know a friend of Amélie's named James? The doctor? Yeah. He was The One. Mom was planning the wedding and everything. Why? What about her? Nah, it was mostly Mom. Why'd they break up? I don't remember. I think he moved away or something. Why? Why all the questions? He's back. Oh. Well, you don't have to worry, Bambi. He ain't got nothing on you. You're safe. (groaning) ♪ Savez-vous planter Des choux à la mode, à la mode ♪ 
♪ Savez-vous planter Des choux à la mode De Chez nous ♪ 
♪ Savez-vous planter Des choux à la mode, à la mode ♪ Thank you. I gotta go do something. Who's that? Maybe a witness. What, about Kaz? Yeah. Where'd this come from? Group home next door. Nick... Nick, Nick. Should you be doing this? If no one else is going to, then yeah. Ain't that always the case. If I find anything, I'll turn it over. Is that alright with you, Mr. Black and White? So, you remember that place that burned down? Yeah. We all saw it. We watched it burn from our roof. Before that, did you see anything going on in that house? Anything at all? Yeah. Yeah? Like what? Get me out of that shithole and I'll tell you all about it. Come on, I got no control over that. Of course you do. Girl in my last home saw another girl get gang raped, she told police and she got placed in a mansion in Westmount right away. Yeah, well, this is a very different situation. But... if I did see something serious, and I was willing to cooperate... Are you saying you saw something serious? Don't play games with me. You won't be disappointed. What's so bad about this place, anyway? Looked okay to me. I could easily go live with my uncle, but Social Services won't let me. Why not? They say I have a history of cutting, but it's bullshit. It happened once like five years ago, but it sticks to my file forever. You wanna check? See? OK. OK, well, before we do anything, I need to know exactly what it is you saw, and then maybe we'll see about what we can do for you, OK? How's that? Fine. Forget it. Hey. Hey, man...  Hey, that's mine. 19-2... [19-2, go ahead.] Whatever, man. Do what you gotta do. [19-2, what's your call?] Never mind, cancel that. Where'd you go? Took a piss. How'd it go? I don't know, I think she's playing me. She's a crafty little one. Why, what does she want? She wants out of her group home in exchange for a statement. Ahh. So what does she know? I don't know. Maybe she saw nothing, maybe she saw the whole thing. Well, what are you gonna do? Talk to Amélie, see if she can swing something. I'm not sure you bring her into this. It's her job to help cops with foster kids. No, it's her job to protect the kids. Right. What happened? There was a break-in last night. Hm. They catch the guy? Nope. What about the... It doesn't work. Hm. You must think I just wave a magic wand and make this happen. I'm not her case worker. So talk to them. Why can't you talk to her? 'Cause she'll shoot me down. Come on, Am, where's the kid's file? It's in Chicoutimi. Why is the girl's social worker in Chicoutimi? That's where she's from. We have a broken system, I know. They got a telephone, right? Come on, Am, I'm not asking for anything radical here. There must be a better place for the girl somewhere. Four homes closed down this year because of budget cuts. The place she's in is already a better place. She says it's the worst one she's been in. Of course she says that. They all say that. OK, well, she's got an uncle. If he didn't get custody, there's a reason. Dammit, Nick, you had no right making promises. I didn't make any promises, Am. I just said I'd check, and that's what I'm doing. She says she knows something about Kaz. Oh, now you tell me? Just see what you can do. What about you, Tonto? You just gonna stand there? If she knows anything, we'll report it. Oh, well, aren't you a good boy? Please, Am. Look at this guy. What? Are we invisible? Yeah, he'll do. (siren blaring) You get him, I'll get the van. OK. 19-7, in pursuit of a dark Grey van heading south on St-Urbain. Got you, m*therf*cker. Where do you think you're going here? Asshole. (tires screeching) f*ck! Goddamn it, son of a bitch! f*ck! (panting) You lost him? Would've had him if I'd been on a bike. Yeah, probably not. Where'd you lose him? Down that way. Goddamn it, rookie! Making your daddy real proud right now. Hey, that's not fair. You left me. Gimme a boost. Come on! Yeah, OK. Jesus. Holy sh1t! Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This place is worth checking out. Do you want to call in for a warrant? Or you can put on your big boy pants and be a cop. Well, jack-fucking-pot. Wow! (clanking) Police! We're coming in. (rustling) Hey! Come back here! (grunting) Got you, m*therf*cker. (laughing) Oh, come on. Dulac : This was a really big fish. There was a whole... a whole ring, really. I mean, there must've been two... 2,000 bikes, I'd say. Yeah, 2,000 bikes between... I mean, Robbery didn't even know this place existed. Tremendous work, Richard. Tyler, how you feeling? Shitty. Had something a couple weeks ago too, went on for about 24 hours. What was it, the flu? Yeah, Chartier, it was the flu. I'm good now. You alright? You don't look so good. I've been better. Alright, people, let's get this over with. Today's beautiful faces. Pass them around. We are ticketing Laurier Park. Be on the lookout for... (voice fades out) men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault. They seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those too who suffer from great emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest. Hey. I know you. I don't think so. Yeah, I do. You're a cop. Wrong guy, dog. 19, right? I'm in 37, East End. Jerry. Tyler. Hey. It's good to see brethren in the rooms. We need more of us. How much time you got? Uh, a bit of time. Yeah? How many days? None. You're in the right place. Yeah? Nice meeting you, Jerry. You got a safe place to stay tonight? Excuse me? Do you have a safe place to stay tonight? I'm good, don't worry. Let me ask you something. The only thing you know how to do is drink and bullshit people, am I right? Yeah. Come on. Let's go. OK, lights out. I usually watch a bit of TV before I drift off. Lights out. Good night. (footsteps approaching) Hey. You're home late. Robbery squad said 20 minutes three hours ago. I left you a message. It's better to text me. It's OK, I just got home, I didn't call you. Why are you sitting here in the dark? It's peaceful. I like the streetlights on the walls. Any update on the job? Yeah, I really wanna take it. Good. Congratulations. I can't. Why not? I got kids I can't dump. You can manage it. No, I can't. Thank you, though. I'm gonna help James find the right person. We're having breakfast in the morning. I found a place for Martine. It's not exactly great, but... Nick will appreciate it. I wasn't thinking about Nick. Good. Every night, for three straight nights. Screaming, crying. When was this, exactly? I don't remember what day exactly. It was after the big storm. Look, you have to be perfectly clear so there can be no confusion. I could hear best from the vent. It went on for three nights. Like, for hours. Sometimes quiet, sometimes loud. What kind of screams did you hear? Like a grown man's screams. But then sometimes I couldn't tell. It sounded like some kind of animal after a while. See anyone coming or going from the house? During the day, I... I saw a white guy going in and out. A white guy? What kind of white guy? I don't know, just a regular white guy. I need you to be more specific. Please. He was carrying one of those big bags of concrete into the house. Concrete? Yeah. It was heavy for him. How old was he? Pretty old. Like... maybe 40. And then what? Then I'd sit here like this and listen. Now it sounds like the ocean. (Kaz screaming)
