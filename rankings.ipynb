      "Seeing more variety for food in the North Shore has me pumped! There is a Poké place in Beverly, but it's a little far. However, this is down the street for me. Not so excited that it is physically located in the mall, but it makes sense. Well, at the time before the whole Corona Virus pandemic started. Lame. \n",

      "The food, we must talk about the food darling. The food is fresh and lighter fare. I always feel a little unsatisfied with the bowls, which the Teriyaki Musubi helped put in a dent. But it's healthy and doesn't leave one feeling run down. There are so many cheeseburgers you can hammer down before you're saying \"damn I need a salad or something.\" This is a great option. It is fast; prepped and the bowl is put together right in front of you. It's a healthier option with regards to fast food, and I hope people are willing to give this place a shot.\n",

      "i was heading to singing beach from boston, started to get the munchies, and craved for a salad.  I found big fin pokie and after realizing it's in a mall, I seriously hesitated.  But my craving over powered my \"ugh\" moment for going into a mall.  I parked near the food court entrance, big fin is in the way back on the left adjacent to Claire's (where you get yo sparkles on).\n",

      "\n",
      "The spicy tuna was super fresh, the melody of flavors used blended well together, and everything was balanced.  I was shocked.  Am I at a mall eating a pokie ball that is legit on point?  Yes.  The mixed greens, edamame, side of imitation crab salad on top of the salad, and cucumbers were very fresh.  There was some guac/avocado that was a tinge brown but nothing that wasn't inconsumable.\n",

I didn't realize they had samples, but I'm happy with my picks: salmon and yellow tail (step 1), Kailani and shoyu sauces (step 2), all the mix-ins. Warning: the wasabi and jalapeno combo got a little spicy (though delicious to contrast with the shoyu and are easy to exclude). \n",
      "\n",
      "For the uninitiated, poké (like Pokémon) is a quick and healthy option that originated in Hawaii. Think Chipotle but with sushi; salad instead of beans but rice is still an option). Freshness is key, and in the west coast this is commonly available and relatively cheap. Unfortunately the east coast has been a lot slower to pick up this trend, and after opening the prices are higher. Big Fin Poke is competing with the rest of the food court though, so the pricing seems to be a great deal. Definitely try it out!\n",

We are huge fans and will brave the rush hour traffic to head up here. It's not big so definitely don't be bringing 20 people all at once....although I can't vouch for the new location moving forward.   \n",

      "Taco Tuesdays are a big draw for us, I think they are only $1-2 a piece, just not steak and fish.  But they don't skimp and still come loaded with pico de gallo, guac and other veggies.  The shells aren't your typical corn you'd buy in the grocery store, they are very thick and hold up well when biting.  We also love the elote, caution.....it is SPICAY!!  Smothered in mayo and cayenne pepper although I don't think there is any of the typical cotija cheese.  \n",

When you walk in the inside feels a lot bigger than you'd think from just walking by. Everything inside was clean, new and nicely decorated. Although I appreciate the high tops, it was majority high top tables and only 1 normal table, which threw me off a bit.\n",

      "Now, the reason i give this only 3 stars is the food. I ordered a quesadilla and my bf ordered a burrito. The prices are good and the portions they give are pretty big, but the food overall was bland. I grabbed a pork quesadilla with everything it came with minus the pico-de-gallo. The pork inside were big pieces, a bit chewy, and not much flavor. I wish the pork was shredded, making for more even bites. I think it was the rice that didn't have much flavor, because although it had sour cream, lettuce, beans and cheese, it all just tasted like 1 note. My bfs burrito was a bit better but he doused his in a lot of hot sauce to bring out more flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The gave us some chips and salsa to wait for our food, which was nice, but the salsa tasted like 80% tomato. Maybe try to find something that has more spice? Overall I think they have a lot of potential, but right now as it stands, its overall kinda bland. I know they are new so I have hope, but when I think of Mexican food I think spices, flavor, and that Mexican flare. This didn't not deliver.\n",

Peabody is lacking a lot of places for young adults to go to. But you will definitely see me back here. Too bad they don't have their liquor license. Maybe in the future ;) The food was perfect. Though, they were out of fish when we got there. Which in my opinion, if a place 86's a menu item that day, it means everything is made fresh daily, and produce is brought in daily. Which I'm assuming is the case here.\n",

We were eager to try the place so we said that was okay and had a nice chat while we sat and wait. I ordered the la ribs galbee with rice and kimchee. My hubby got the pork ribs with rice and kimchi. Both were delicious, high quality, authentic, and well worth the wait. We felt right at home surrounded by many Korean families eating equally delicious looking food.\n",
