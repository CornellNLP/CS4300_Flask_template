Was given loads of antibiotics as a kid (sigh). Tried every OTC medicine as a young adult without much success.  Mild help from things like Claritin when it hit the market.  Did 2 years of allergy shots....and I was still miserable, and downing Sudafed on a regular basis to breath.   Finally a ENT got an order for a slice n dice MRI.  Couple thousand in sinus surgery later to correct a 90 percent blocked off nasal passage and life is better. Not perfect. But better.  So why did I get into my late 30s with this and NEVER get an MRI before DECADES of medication that didn't really resolve the issue?\n\nAgain. I'm in my late 30s.  I have trouble focusing on one voice in a  crowd. I get anxiety. I get diagnosed with GAD. I get benzos, I get therapy. Problem never gets better.  I complain that I have to stop TV shows to hear my husband ask a question, that I can't hear someone in a crowded restaurant, but I have 'perfect' hearing tests going back as a kid.\n\nWouldn't you know, auditory processing deficit is a thing.  Bad wiring from the ears to the brain.  I will NEVER EVER be able to do that trick of focusing on one voice in a crowd.  I will never want a TV audio system that has a center channel for audio  because the left and right then obscure that channel. All my child hood anxiety of navigating disturbing locker lined hall ways and buzzing lunch rooms explained in one little biological quirk. In my late thirties. \n\nWhen people leap to software rather than hard ware it's missing a critical step in the process of the differential diagnosis. It's why a dog who isn't eating needs to be checked for a liver shunt and digestive enzyme production rather than being called 'picky'. It's why we should check vitamin levels in people with depression.

The format is half of coding. Different languages have different formating although most resemble each other because they mostly resemble C.\n\nThe other half is thinking how to code. It is surprisingly simple. Think about what you are any to accomplish, separate it into a series of steps. It doesn't matter how complex these steps are and it doesn't matter how many, it matters that the steps accomplish the goal and that there are a finite number of them. Now look at each of the steps, is that already a function call? Doesn't matter if it is yours or a library or built into the language, if it is a function call, call that function. Otherwise split the step up into smaller steps, repeat.\n\nThat really is the basics of programming. Over time you'll gain experience on the best way to split up steps as you align it better with functions that already exist. Over time you'll learn to format for readability.\n\nNow debugging, the other 90% of programming. Again very simple. Look at what is coming into a step, and what is coming out of a step, is that the correct output for the input? Yes, then this bug is not in that step. No, then dig into that step, repeat. Eventually you will narrow it down to one particular point and you should be able to tell rather quickly the problem. Sometimes you find you have the wrong step entirely, change the step.\n\nAfter that it is memorizing algorithms and methodologies. But the real truth is that methodologies are a lot like religions, seems like everyone has one that is the one true way, but no one actually follows the methodology. \n\nProgramming is actually very simple, but the time it takes is excessive.

I'll share some of my favorite techniques, but there is absolutely no science behind it. Just pure fun testing myself; seeing what works and what doesn't. The only science I know that helps is understanding that memory is tied to emotion. The more emotional the moment, the better the memory (it's how our brains differentiate between the important and the mundane). So here are my favorite techniques:     \n      \n* Always have a pen on you to write stuff on your hand. It's as important as your phone, ID, debit card, etc. Can't tell you how many pickles I got out of just because I happened to look down and see a note to myself.     \n* WRITE IT DOWN!!! Your chances of not forgetting skyrocket. Piece of paper. Doesn't matter. I tell my wife all the time to do this. She always forgets to.     \n* Train yourself to ask if you need to do anything at the most random moments you can think of. If you feel accomplished, great! Now was there anything else? The more times &amp; places you remember something, the more it'll stick in your brain.      \n* Just remember a letter. It's much easier than the thing itself. \"A! Why did I remember A.... hmm.... oh yeah! Apples. I need to pick up apples.\" Sometimes I'll use sign language. I look at my hand making an A. It helps as an instant visual.     \n* PRACTICE!!!!

The key, in my opinion, is not increasing the rate at which you read. That will only give you marginal results in the long run. You will end up trading comprehension for speed except for in a small set of situations. Even if you use spritz, there are some serious limitations. Some platforms don't have spritz or something similar, any deviation of concentration will slow you down and force you to go back, and even if you do concentrate, you're locked into that screen. You cannot do anything else except sit, stare, and read.  \n  \nInstead of pursuing that strategy, I highly suggest audiobooks as an alternative. The goal isn't to read faster--it's to read as much as possible wherever, whenever, and under nearly any circumstances. There are apps that can allow you to download audiobooks from your local library for free (e.g. Hoopla and overdrive).  \n  \nIf you think about it, this strategy makes more sense. When you read with your eyes, you're unable to do anything else. You can't look anywhere or use your hands. You're locked in.  \n  \nWhen you're listening to an audiobook, you can do other things. You can do your laundry, wash your dishes, or drive to work. I read Moby Dick while doing my morning workouts. If you're concerned about comprehension, you can always test yourself to see if you're getting the most out of what you're reading. My tests have shown that I comprehend at near the same rate I do when I read normally. Moreover, with an audiobook you can have the book read to you at a faster pace. I read non-fiction self-help books at 2x normal speed and find that I keep up pretty well.\n\nWhile some might say that reading with your eyes is substantially different from an audiobook, I would point out that audiobooks are actually really similar. Normal reading leads to subvocalization in the brain. That is, you hear your own internal voice and monologue when you're reading with your eyes. So either you listen to yourself reading or listen to someone else.

Ruthless use of a spaced repetition software like Anki. I put most of the things I want to memorise in there even reminders to review my material. Try to start with that if you haven't.\n\n2. Teaching others can be good; if you can teach, it is likely that you memorise the materials well.\n\n3. If retaining information is very important to you, avoid mere consuming of things. In my case, I hated how many times I experienced stuff but didn't remember, to the point that I try to summarise or reflect on anything I consume; this Reddit thread included. This commitment is helpful because first, obviously it can be a quick test of my comprehension and understanding, and second, it provides a barrier so I am more selective in what I choose to read eg \"Want to read this? You can but you'll have to summarise it afterwards.\"\n\n4. Take notes. There will always be things that you'll forget so might as well have backups for reference. Notes are in a way memories except it is outside your brain.\n\n5. Match type of memory with the type of repetitions and practice. If it is song lyrics, sing; programming language, program; recipes, cook; and so forth.\n\n6. Synthesise your knowledge. Try to write a critique or summarise it in a blog. Maybe, record yourself talking about it. Or have a discussion with someone. Case in point - convert your internal knowledge into external forms.\n\n7. Always review. Memory gets more fickle as we grow older making reviewing habits more important than ever.\n\n8. Let people challenge your thoughts. Debates, especially ones that are done in the name of truth and not in the name of winning or validation of uncontested beliefs, are excellent at seeing whether you understand the topics. You'll have to learn and refer to your sources a lot of times - more repetitions!\n\n\n", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "antiel", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1485987409, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5rcaof", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488483553, "controversiality": 0, "id": "dd7jct8", "link_id": "t3_5rcaof", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Don't get me wrong, I do love music theory, but I'd definitely say yes to your first question.\n\nHere's an example of what not to do: I once saw a tutorial (can't find it right now) in which a portion of it involved demonstrating a particularly unusual chord.

I imagine technical books and books on mathematics would be like that.  \n  \nFor things like that, speeding up wouldn't be worth the comprehension/retention loss.

Books are like tools. Some are better than others at helping you perform certain tasks. If forced to recommend some books just generally, I would recommend the following books:  \n  \n1. Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman  \n2. Willpower by Roy Baumeister  \n3. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg  \n4. The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal  \n  \nIf your goal is to get in shape, then I recommend focusing on the Power of Habit, the 4 Hour Body, and Starting Strength.  \n  \nIf you want to improve your memory, I would recommend Moonwalking with Einstein.  \n  \nIf you want to improve your creativity, I would recommend The Artist's Way and Originals by Adam Grant.  \n  \nIf you want to improve your social skills, I would recommend Give and Take by Adam Grant, How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, and Never Eat Alone.  \n  \nIf you want to just read inspiring biographies, I would recommend Elon Musk's biography, Titan (a biography on John D. Rockefeller), and Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination by Neal Gabler.  \n  \nI've also really enjoyed A Tale of Two Cities, Moby Dick, and East of Eden. For fun junk food reading, I really liked Ready Player One, American Gods, The Martian, and Small Gods.  \n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "doesntgetsocialcues", "created_utc": 1485988860, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_dd7glcj", "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488484335, "link_id": "t3_5r9ypz", "id": "dd7knso"}, {"body": "Google html tutorial and pick one.

There are a lot of factors that can make a student struggle, and depression is a big one. Have you talked to your counselor about your depression? Your parents, friends? If you haven't, please do! Don't ever be afraid to get help. Your friends and family love you, and your counselors, at least in my experience, are there because they want to help. Reach out!\n(As a side note, if you open up to a teacher about your depression, please don't be discouraged if they direct you to a counselor, it does not mean that they don't care about you! It is the opposite I assure you. Many times we want to talk to our students more, and want to help, but we are trained to direct these types of personal situations to a professional, your counselor, so that someone that is trained, and still very much caring for your well being, can get you the help you need. Personally, I would be happy to hear you out, but would have no idea how to get you further help! We are just trying to get you to someone who can help you!)\n\nOther factors are so various, that unless I knew your individual situation I wouldn't be able to help. However, just some general tips. \n\nMake sure you are getting enough sleep! A high school student needs at least 8 hours a night. Get enough to eat! Make sure you are eating in the mornings, especially if you have a late lunch schedule, and eat food that has some nutritional value like fruits, lean meats, and veggies. Talk to your teachers! Talk to your teacher before/after bell, or at a down time, and let them know that you want to do better in their class! Ask them what their expectations are for you to succeed in their class. Know your teachers redo/correction policy. Tell them you genuinely want to do better in their class, not just to squeak by for sports, or band etc. Tell them this as early in the grading period as you can. If you tell me you want to do better and pass a day before grades are up for the grading period with a failing grade I will sigh... Tell me you want to do the best you can and ask me what you can do to be successful in my class on day one of the grading period and I will split the earth asunder for you. A simple gesture like this, at least in my case, would do wonders for you!\n\nAre you more involved in extracurricular activities than before? Did you load up on AP/early college classes? Are you working after school? Ask yourself if your schedule is allowing you to do your best and succeed. If not, get it changed!\n\nI wish you the best.

So, it seems like you have a nice foundation already. I would suggest taking a moment to reflect on your previous mathematical competency, and make sure you're pretty confident in it. If you don't feel confident and think you're well grounded already, then I suggest reviewing before trying to tackle anything further.\n\nNow, by \"Higher Level Math\", what you're asking for is very different than the calculations-based math you've seen so far. Higher Mathematics involves very few calculations, and instead focuses on theory and proving theorems. This is proof-based mathematics. In case you're not familiar, doing proofs are how we know a theorem is true. Consider Pythagoras Theorem, one which most are familiar with. In college Trigonometry, we pretty much accept it as true and use it to find the length of the sides of some right triangles. However, what if we were to ask why it is true? How do we really know it's true? Well it turns out that theorems must be proven to be true. Pythagoras Theorem looks like this:\n\n&gt; For all right triangles with sides A, B, C, with lengths a, b, c, respectively, all real numbers, it follows that a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n\nThere are many ways to prove that this theorem is true. These methods must be mastered to do higher level mathematics. It's absolutely crucial to know how to prove theorems and apply the rules of logic.\n\nYou listed Topology, Fractals, and Differential Equations as some fields which interest you. You can study differential equations at a lower level, like Linear Algebra, but there's a whole new world beyond that. It turns out that all of the aforementioned topics actually form a field of Mathematics known as [Dynamical Systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) with [Dynamical Systems Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory) at the heart of this field. This is an extremely complex field to get into, though, as there are so many foundational subjects which need to be mastered before pursuing.\n\nIf you want to study higher mathematics, there are several fields which are considered basic. These are Set Theory, Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory. All branches of mathematics descend from one or more of these fields. You'll want to pick up a book on Naive Set Theory, Real Analysis, and Abstract Algebra definitely before moving on to something like Topology, as these subjects will be foundational to Topology.\n\nThere are a lot more fields than just those I mentioned, though. Check out [this page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_mathematics) for some links to more information about them. I would suggest learning proofs, if you don't already, and practice doing as many as you can. The only way to learn and get good at Math is to do it. Work out as many problems as you can, and experiment with different ideas.

Prozac slowed me down, now I can think during situations without commenting - usually snappy sarcasm or some other dumb thing - until I can think of the best thing to say, or even think to just keep my mouth shut.\n\nI used to try to be as mute as possible to control these things, too. Didn't really start talking until I went to school at five.

Here we go:\n\n**General Advice**\n\n* Learn the basics of formal logic.\n\nMost advanced mathematics is focused on *proof* rather than *calculations*, which is somewhat the opposite of how high-school and early college mathematics is used/taught. You'll find that more advanced textbooks or resources will be asking you to prove things almost exclusively, and you'll need a strong basis in logic in order to do so.\n\n* Find areas you are particularly interested in.\n\nYou mentioned fractals (one of my favorite areas as well), and my advice is to focus on areas of interest to you. Hopefully by doing so you'll naturally fall down the rabbit hole, so to speak, and end up learning a lot of the related mathematics. The more you learn, the more areas of interest you'll find, ad infinitum.\n\nFor fractals in particular, you'll want to start looking into the field of complex analysis, and become familiar with the complex plane and calculations in it. Additionally, if you're at all interested in computer science, you might try playing around with fractal generation programs, or even try writing your own.\n\n* Don't be afraid of the textbook\n\nIn order to learn higher level math, you'll HAVE to dive into a textbook or two. Videos and other online resources are fantastic, but will not cut it in the end, as I find they're typically light on the critical details you'll need to fully understand a subject. Moreover, you'll want the text for reference later.\n\n**Resources**\n\nI found the book _The Heart of Mathematics_ to be a great start myself. It's an overview of some of the more interesting areas of mathematics, without too much of the formal rigor, so it's relatively easy to read for a newcomer. It's a little dated these days (or at least my edition is), but I can't recommend it highly enough.\n\nDover texts are very cheap but I find they're typically very formal and difficult unless you already have the hang of things. However, if you feel comfortable with proofs and mathematical notation in general, they're a very inexpensive way to get into some of the more advanced areas of mathematics. Use with caution.\n\nEven though is is only somewhat related, I always feed the need to mention numberphile's youtube channel. His videos are very interesting and also very easy to understand even as a layperson. Might help to spark a few areas of curiosity for you.\n\nI suspect that classes are not a possibility for you, or you wouldn't be asking here, but theres nothing better than a real flesh and blood human to bounce your questions off of when you're confused. If you know of such a person, talk to them if you can, even if it's only for a few minutes here and there.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nEverybody learns a little differently, so find whatever works for you and stick with it. Make sure not to give up if you find it challenging at first, I know that at least for me, I had a very hard time until things finally 'clicked'.\n\nFinally, make sure to enjoy yourself. Otherwise, why bother. That might be the most important piece of advice here. And feel free to hit me up if you have questions. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your dive into the deep and wonderful word of math!", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author": "OnlyWhiteRice", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1486176194, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": "t3_5rrry2", "link_id": "t3_5rrry2", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488551787, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "ddb3kjm", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": 1487591709, "created_utc": 1486176265, "link_id": "t3_5rvn2i", "parent_id": "t1_ddaxks0", "distinguished": null, "score": -4, "retrieved_on": 1488551809, "id": "ddb3m75", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "There's not many, but ADHD-Specific nonstimulants are a healthier, less dangerous option.

I'm not from there, but I have some suggestions for you based on your location and some more general advice. My most general piece of advice is just to go out locally and start asking questions to any fishermen you can find.\n\nIf your goal is to catch fish regardless of the species, I'd think about fishing the piers on Lake Ontario near you. Hamilton Harbor has got to have decent fishing. Before you even spend any money on gear, I'd head out there and just see if you can find some fishermen. Just walk around, say hello, and talk to them. I guarantee at least one will be willing to tell you what kind of fish they're targeting and what they're using to catch them. Your goal is really to gather intel each place you go. \n\nTake that info to your local bait &amp; tackle shop (not a big box store if you can avoid it) and say you want to get into fishing, you'd been to the pier and were thinking of targeting (x fish you learned about). They'll be more than happy to help you get equipped or to provide a suggestion for something different. Of course, you can just go straight there without ever going to the pier first, but, personally, I'd rather go in the shop with some idea of what I wanted.\n\nYou can join local forums, clubs, etc. You can watch videos and buy books. But really, the best thing you can do in my experience is just to talk to the other fishermen you meet. That's one of the most wonderful parts of fishing from my perspective; there's a ton to learn online and from other media, but none of that holds a candle to the information you can gather by talking to the local people you meet. Plus, you might make a fishing buddy that really knows what they're doing and then you're set.\n\nAt the risk of making this too long, I'd also consider fishing for steelhead. The tributaries to Lake Ontario will have steelhead that run up them from fall to spring.\n\nFor easier stuff with small children, look for ponds or lakes where you can catch bluegill. Your province, municipality or sportsmen's organization might also stock trout streams.

My suggestion is to observe others. It is a little more complicated than just watching an interaction you must really watch what happens after. \n\nExample, out shopping you observe a child excitedly asking a mother for money to purchase something. The mother asks lots of questions, she doesn't look excited, she slowly reaches for her handbag to get out the money. From that interaction I can tell you that she doesn't want to give the child the money. I can speculate on lots of reasons why but if you continue to watch the mother after the child walks away, you see her carefully count the $ in her wallet, her shoulders drop, she shakes her head a little as it hangs in sadness. The child comes running up clearly excited and she smiles. It is then that you can understand that she doesn't have a lot of money but wants her child to be happy. All the questions about the item where to help determine if this was really the item the child should get since there would only be enough money for one item that day. \n\nStart watching those you know best. If you know your mom hates it when your dad doesn't take out the garbage out without being asked after dinner. Watch your mom's reaction when your dad walks by the garbage can. \n\nIf you are lucky enough to have someone in your life who is willing to help and be honest with you, tell them your goal and ask for their help. Then watch them. When you sense that something has made them upset or happy, etc. ask them about it. \"I noticed when David said he was going to be late tonight, you smiled at him but when he walked away you looked sad. What were you thinking in those moments?\" If that is uncomfortable for you, you can share your desire with a friend and you can go people watching together. An afternoon spent in a public place (shopping malls, amusement parks, restaurants) are great to people watch. Point out people to each other and make up stories about what is happening at that moment and what they are talking about. \n\nRecently, at the grocery store I watched a man and a woman shopping together. It was clear they were a couple as she called him pet names and said things like \"honey, will you grab that off the top shelf?\"  They were both wearing wedding rings, I think it is safe to assume they were married. As I went aisle by aisle in the store, they were just in front of me. I began to notice he would fall behind as she turned a corner, he would stop, pull out his phone, smile at it, type a few things then hurry and put it back in his pocket and try and catch up with his wife. As we went through the store this continued to happen and he began to seem more unhappy each time he interacted with his wife.

As a bonus, they'll keep you accountable and you'll be motivated to run more.\n\n-go on \"Adventure Runs\": Run for a set amount of time (or mileage if you have a gps watch) and don't worry about planning a route. Just run wherever seems the most interesting. Don't be afraid to hop fences or stop somewhere every once in awhile.\n\n-hit the trails: A tough trail will focus all of your brain power on attempting to not fall on your face. This distracts you from running pain too.\n\n-run races: Not only are races exciting, but they will motivate you to train for them.\n\n-change it up: Hit the track, do some hills, drive somewhere you've never run before.

Here is the thing, everyone usually tries to push you towards things that help you ignore the fact that you are lonely. That is a short term answer obviously because once you are done with that or you go to bed and you are left alone without stimulus it becomes apparent that you are still in fact, lonely. \n\nOne thing I discovered that helps me greatly is finding comfort in being alone, for me being alone is not a punishment. It's a privilege. Think about it, everyday you are constantly fed a stream of overwhelming stimulus through media, or human interaction. Being. Alone in a safe comfortable quiet space is your best way of discovering who you are as a person. Start thinking of your ideas or your philosophies, gain knowledge through reading or through looking and seeing. Work towards being able to absorb your surroundings. I walk around my block everyday, alone, in quiet, and slowly. \n\nThis gives me fresh air and space to cultivate thought and emotion, you can't go about trying to hide or mask your sadness, that will only anger it. See it eye to eye, understand it, be at peace with it. Loneliness or being alone is natural. It isn't a scary thing. Once you cultivate your ideas and fears and issues and learn to accept them then you can start to grow yourself physically and mentally through passion. \n\nI paint, I write, I read. \"Oh but you said that stimulus is just trying to mask the loneliness\" well this is different now, because you're not trying to hide your pain now, you've already realized that pain and loneliness is part of human nature. Now you're trying to mend the wound to the best of your ability, through expression of self. Do not paint to ignore the pain, do not write to hide the sorrow, do not pursue passions for the sole purpose of ignoring what's hurting you. Live to grow yourself. Pain, loneliness, sorrow and all.

I've been trying to improve my handwriting my whole life and it's just miserable. But that's because I have dysgraphia, which is a motor-functioning problem that makes it hard for me to write things by hand and sometimes affects the way my fingers move in general. I draw and can do my makeup really well, but I can't write neatly and I make a lot of mistakes when I type (autocorrect is a blessing for speed, otherwise I would spend all day correcting things I know how to spell but my fingers refuse to type). The best way to figure out if this is the case for you is basically two criteria: 1) does your writing hand get crampy and uncomfortable relatively quickly? And 2) does writing with your shoulder or elbow (as opposed to wrist and fingers) not make improvements? \n\nIf that criteria matches your experience, you could have a fine motor issue like dysgraphia. Which isn't a big deal: it's a learning disability and super common. The best way I find to deal with it is to have a backup for notes (like the livescribe pen or typed notes if you can) and to have some low-tech assistance. Bigger pencil grips and practicing writing with your shoulder help a bit with the pain and do improve your writing some, and you may also like to get this ruler that's made to help you stay on the lines. Typically they're made for visually impaired people but they help people like me too. A regular ruler works too, but this one has a cutout for the line instead of just the bottom.

Everyone can think about stuff but not everyone thinks in an effective way. If thinking to you is about just having thoughts before you try to do anything, then that's an easy thing to learn. Force yourself to conjure words inside your head and you're set and done.\n\nBut that's not what you want. I presume you want to think in a way that helps you to solve problems or reach your goals. To do that, you'll have to learn how to match your beliefs with reality; or if you're familiar with the Less Wrong website, to match your map with the territory. \n\nI had always found the map that corresponds to the territory a great picture to have but the metaphor doesn't make it explicit that even if you have a good map, it's not guaranteed that you will walk the path exactly as drawn on the map. Rational people, one group of thinkers out of many, can possess accurate beliefs but when it comes to real-world scenarios, their map are not followed 100%. Yet, that's not a problem because life is messy, life is hard, and life can go against you even you are the most prepares for it. \n\nThis begs the question: why would I bother improving my thinking if there is still a chance of me not getting what I want? This is when I induce the greatest of the self-help principle: we do our best and it is about moving towards perfection not embodying perfection itself. Improvement in thinking can increase your chance of getting what you want; to increase your chance from 10% to 25% is a great feat. It is still not 100% isn't it? The key thing is understanding that there is still uncertainty involved and the mark of a good thinker is how well he can stand uncertainty. I repeat that life is messy. Someone who devoted his life believing one thing, who thought that he had scoured almost everything that verified his beliefs, might find that a crucial information comes to light but it reveals itself in a map burning splendour. His belief crumbles yet is that a bad thing? If he's a good thinker, he appreciated his belief is branded an apostate by truth. Thinking in a way that leads to the truth should be thinking in a way that can help us to self-correct our beliefs when they are wrong; the effort is the most important not the belief because frankly, I believe not everyone is capable of making correct beliefs about everything. Time, intelligence, the people that we sureound ourselves with, the era we live in - all of them and a whole lot of variables influence our ability for truth seeking. We should envision a world where everyone tries their best to have accurate beliefs before switching on the idealist in us and envision a world where everyone has accurate beliefs.\n\nRambling over, what's the takeaway? Try to improve the way you match beliefs with reality. I used to believe that I am tall but I realised that the belief came from people telling me that I am tall instead of seeking the formal definition of tallness and verifying it by looking at the data. Lo and behold, now I know that I confused the belief \"I am tall because I am the top X% in height in the world's population\" with \"I am tall because I am surrounded by people shorter that me\". Verifying tallness is easy but that's not the case for other things. An excellent way to start thinking this way is asking the person in your subject matter, \"How do you know this is true/correct/accurate?\" I wished I had asked that question when I was in high school because in my country, it seems like everything was taught with the assumption that they were true therefore some people might be led into believing the wrong thing no matter how good their grades were; the term 'wrong' not necessarily because teachers are teaching false information but more so that students are led to believe without actually doing the kind of thinking that lets them accept the information.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "antiel", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486273351, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5s2z6p", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1488581485, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddcmcff", "link_id": "t3_5s2z6p", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Lose weight slowly and safely, stay hydrated and eat a balanced and nutritious diet and you'll mitigate a lot of loose skin issues.

He seems to have two types - short essays and interviews which are easy to read but often lack details, evidence, footnotes....And then the big books, dense, hard to read, lots of stilted language but lots of footnotes. This is the second type. It was written first in response the the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and focuses on American involvement and American angle more than other book. It has been updated a few times since then, but wouldn't be right up to date in any way, but good on American stuff. \n\nFor a bit of balance try also Benny Morris, and Israeli historian and his book righteous Victims. He is a self described Zionist, and new historian along with ilan pappe and others who challenged many of the myths about the birth of Israel. For a long time he would have said what happened in 1948 was ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians....however he accepts it as nessecary, morally justified and better then the genocide of the Jewish people which would have happened if it wasn't done.\n\nGood luck!

I like to put the persons name in a faint font color on the upper right-hand corner of the slide.  This is both confirmation for the presenters and a nice way to remind the audience who to direct a question towards.  When dividing up the slides, it's not important to have an equal number of slides, as it to have an equal approximation of time (e.g. some slides are more dense or time-consuming than others).  It's also not necessarily important to divvy up equally, if you have subject-matter experts to speak to certain parts.\n\nSpeaker notes are key - they should be pithy sentence fragments and not full statements.  You should practice presenting together, if you can, but at a minimum practice the timing/pacing of your specific piece.\n\n **Don't read the content on a slide verbatim.**  \n\nStammering is not a big deal - don't psyche yourself out over it.

At worst it makes one look pretentious, other times it's just cringey.\n\nI'm not a master of diction in any sense, but I've found that speaking more slowly in general is a good thing. It makes it much easier to understand you and unless you're moving comically slow, it makes you dwell on your words more.\n\nIf you need to pause before using a word, chances are you shouldn't be using it. Conversations have flow, they are -in a sense- a dance. You wouldn't try to ruin a dance by using move you can't perform would you? Then why bother with it in conversation? \n\nWhat is far more impressive than vocabulary, is a person who can simply say things. People in general don't care if you know big words. What people do care about is your ability to talk to them well. When I talk to a person and they try to throw in big and \"impressive\" words, two things immediately come to mind: they're trying to sound impressive because they aren't, or they're trying to be belittling. Those aren't the only reasons why someone might talk that way, but lots of people take it that way. This isn't a good thing, especially if the person conducting your job interview felt this way. \n\nSo just knowing vocab won't make you sound impressive. Maybe to school teachers it might, but in general most peoole don't care if you can casually throw \"onomatapoeia\" into a sentence. What they do find impressive is someone who can speak clearly and effectively.\n\nFor example, put yourself into the shoes of an English teacher. You are given two essays, a simpler one that effectively communicates an idea, and a more vocab-rich essay that doesn't communicate as well. Do you think the essay with better vocab will outshine the better understood essay? Typically not.\n\nNow, I understand that it's your goal to use a bigger vocabulary effectively, and that is an admirable goal. But what's ultimately more important is that you learn to communicate more concisely first. It's more impressive to have a simpler and understandable response to everything, than it is to have a fancier but broken response to a few things.\n\nTo wrap everything up, practice speaking clearly and effectively first. As you come to master this, it'll become much easier to put more complex words into your speech without needing to stop. Don't try to use big words for the sake of using them. Words are tool of communication; why use a sledgehammer when a mallet will do? And finally, hold onto your vocab, and don't try to flaunt it. Use what you know will work, then save your vocab for when someons tries to \"sound impressive\" like you used to. The fact that you know what they're saying and can respond more eloquently than them is much more impressive.\n\nAs an extra tip, do a lot of reading. Watch shows and movies with the subtitles on. Come to /r/writing and see what they're talking about once in a while. Read up on speech and communication skills. Write dialogue, have conversations with yourself (do it mentally if you don't want to seem weird). But most of all, enjoy it. If you can find fun in it, you're only bound to improve.\n\nEdit: don't type on mobile if you want to write something perfect", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "Luminous_Nox", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": 1486323372, "created_utc": 1486323017, "link_id": "t3_5s540g", "parent_id": "t3_5s540g", "distinguished": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1488594737, "id": "ddda3l0", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "You just have to realize how shitty the world is and then nothing is funny anymore.

The right word is preparation. Presentations are meant to be simple, clear and concise. When you over-practice, you are basically reading off a script. That shows lack of confidence which is basically inviting the audience to try and unbalance you. Preparation means you have mastered your topic. If you are prepared, you can be conversational. You can respond to the audience much better this way.\n\n\nThe other tip I have for staying calm under the pressure is to take your time speaking. Speak slowly and deliberately rather than rushing through it. Basically explain things like you would to your best friend. Having the conversational tone is where charisma comes from!

It's painful but absolutely critical in improving. Doing it in the mirror is not the same. Joining an organization like Toastmasters can help as well.\n\n2) Present to eyes. This is helpful particularly in smaller meeting rooms and over video conferences. There will be people looking at their phones, laptops, whatever, that doesn't concern you. If they're looking down look where their eyes should be. Scan the room, spend a few seconds with someone's eyes, then find someone else and spend a few seconds with them. Don't stare, talk to them.\n\n3) Pick an arm to gesture with and an arm to point with and keep them consistent. 99% of the time you will gesture with your right and point with your left, this is a good habit to get in so if you're presenting in front of a projector you aren't blocking anything. Do not stick your hands in your pockets. You're gonna want to really bad. Don't. \n\n4) Practice. You probably have a story you love to tell, tell that story to everyone. Find your cadence from that and then use that elsewhere. For example: I realized that if I used the speed and cadence i use when reading my son \"one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish\" to start a presentation I can swing into a more natural rhythm.\n\n5) Internalize your content. I can speak eloquently on the challenges facing software developers because that's what I deal with day in and day out. If I needed to present about elephants you can be damn sure I would be reading about elephants as much as humanly possible.\n\n6) If you make a mistake or trip over a word just pause, collect your thoughts and continue. Do not apologize for a mistake, particularly if you just fumbled a word and under no circumstances beat yourself up about it. I can't tell you how many times I've seen presenters mumble \"stupid\" or something similar under their breath. Nobody is thinking that until you say it.\n\n7) Diction - Perform vocal warm ups, they exist for a reason.\n\n8) Try to not being sentences with \"So\" and try to remove uhms and ahs from your speech. These are both really hard to do but it forces you to focus on what you're actually saying.\n\n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "bobimpact", "link_id": "t3_5s8il0", "created_utc": 1486343665, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": "t3_5s8il0", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488603336, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "dddpok1"}, {"body": "So, fine that I'm another internet stranger about to be, to some degree, rude, but... \n\nThe reason you're self-conscious aint' because you can't speak more with more grace and fluidity, but rather because *you're overwhelmingly concerned with trying to be impressive.*  \n\nNo one likes a know-it-all.  No one likes a topic-topper.  no one likes someone who's *trying* to be impressive.  Fair warning - those people can be picked out in a heartbeat.\n\nSo - What's wrong with taking your time to think?  What's wrong with working through someone elses position/thought - that was rushed out in their own attempt to be heard - slowly and calmly, so that you can respond with a holistic, clear thought.  Ain't nothing wrong with that, I'll tell you.   \n\nAnd, just to be fair and not just poke at your emotional need for recognition and approval, here's my two thoughts on your question/goal.\n\n(A)  Slow down.  It's the first thing public speaking classes will tell you - aside from \"practice your speech\".  We have a tendency to rush through communications.  Just slow down.   I see the value in this literally every day.\n\n(B)  Learn poetry.  Good god, this might likely make you insufferable, but learn and memorize some poetry for recital.  Poetry is literally the art and technical skill of language and structure.  *Every* word, in *every* poem (the ones that are worth a damn, at least) are specifically selected for a given reason.  The author wants *that word* to do a specific thing to the reader/listener.  In poetry, you find complex alliterations and sophisticated sentence structures that really flex the ability to speak clearly and concisely.  I've been working on this lately, myself, and have a handful memorized and I can definitely speak to it's efficacy.  \n\nAnyhow...  Good luck.  Slow down.  Practice.  also - start meditating or something, so you can keep that ego in check.  otherwise it will embarrass you flatly despite all your best efforts at \"impressiveness'  I guaren-goddamn-tee you that. \n\n", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "Rocksteady2R", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486344429, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5s540g", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488603655, "controversiality": 0, "id": "dddq9ri", "link_id": "t3_5s540g", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Two colleagues and I did a brief presentation a month ago in front of about 350 people.

The way I was taught is to sit down, close your eyes and relax your whole body. Feel all the different muscle groups and relax the tension out of them as much as possible. Focusing on your breath while doing this can help. Once you get as relaxed as you can that way, start intoning a mantra mentally (a lot of people use \"om\", but it can be anything soft, meaningless, and one-syllable). Don't force it or try to focus, just drop it into your mind like sprinkling salt or something. If you start to have intrusive thoughts, don't force them away, just ease out and back into the mantra. The point is to not focus on anything. If you do it right, without focusing or tensing up too much, you'll feel yourself slide down into a \"lower-energy state\" where you're still aware of your surroundings , but it feels like you're in a little bubble that you'll pop if you move or talk or focus on a thought. Keep sprinkling in the mantra. At least for me, staying like this for 10-15 minutes is really refreshing.

Ultimately it boils down to clearing your mind of busy and distracting thoughts and being mindful of your surroundings and how you react to and think about your surroundings. \n\nOver the course of weeks, in sessions of 5-15 minutes, start by focusing on your breathing, then focus on how very small and specific things feel, then focus on how everything feels. Eventually, focus on other senses and pay attention to *how* you think, not just what you think.\n\n___\n\nThis is a very long and detailed write-up explaining exactly how to go about learning to meditate. I wrote this a couple weeks ago in response to a post about dealing with depression. It didn't get much notice there and I think people will find it useful. \n\nThis post is broken up into a bunch of sections detailing specific phases of the process learning to meditate. Feel free to only read the first couple of sections, then leave the post to go practice that for a couple weeks instead of trying ton read this entire thing in one sitting.\n___\n\nFirst, a bit of information about meditation. Why should you? Turns out it has a lot of health and mental wellness effects. The most noticeable effect is it significantly reduces stress and frustration, which allows you to approach stressful and frustrating things calmly and logically, so you wind up doing them better. Once you are well along in this practice, it also changes the way you think and the way you approach the world, even when you're not actively meditating. Scientists noticed in brain scans that the way the average person thinks when they meditate is how monks that have been meditating for decades think when they're *not* meditating. If you want more information, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TeWvf-nfpA) is a fairly long video (just over an hour) of a panel with an interviewer, two neuroscientists, and mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn talking about the positive effects mindfulness has on your brain and your life. \n\nThere are dozens of kinds of meditation, depending on how precisely you want to define them, but they are generally known to be either Focused Attention Meditation, or Open Monitoring Meditation. \n\nFocused Meditation means focusing your attention on a single thing for the entirety of the meditation session. This may be your breath, a mantra, a part of your body, an object, etc. With practice your attention will become deeper and steadier. This can be used for utility purposes, such as going into a trance when you need to work on a specific task and focusing your attention very precisely and avoiding distractions.\n\nOpen Meditation means opening your focus and observing everything around you and everything within you without reaction, simply monitoring your place in the world. This is a more spiritual meditation, primarily used for stress relief, mental well being, and (typically after many years of practice) transcendence. This is the kind of meditation Buddhist monks will spend their whole lives practicing.\n\nThe process I am about to describe is not true mindfulness in the strict sense of the word, but rather a hybrid that I find easy to learn and easy to teach, as well as useful and practical in everyday life. It starts with simple focused meditation on your breath, then moves to open meditation to your body and surroundings, then returns to more difficult focused meditation on your thoughts and emotions. \n\nIf you want to read up on more types of meditation, [this site](http://liveanddare.com/types-of-meditation/) is a decent resource, which lists 23 kinds of meditation, their origin, a basic summary of how to do them, and talking about whether it's a good choice for you. (Ignore what they say about a third category for meditation, \"Effortless Presence.\" That's a new category they created and is not widely recognized like Focused and Open meditation.)\n\n___\n\nThe first step to mindfulness is a breathing exercise to clear your mind. Find a quiet place with no distractions where you are pretty sure you'll be left alone for 5-10 minutes. By no distractions, I don't mean silent - white noise from fans or traffic is fine, but no sounds you can actively concentrate on like TV, music, conversation, etc. Get comfortable so you won't have to move (forget the stereotypical [meditation pose](http://www.fitnessgymyoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Yoga-Meditation-Poses.jpg) unless of course it's comfortable for you) and close your eyes.\n\nNow, breathe deeply and slowly. If it helps you to concentrate, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. For these first couple of sessions, focus entirely on breathing. Keep your breath steady and even, and try to relax your body and mind. Release all your muscles, relax your shoulders, your tongue, your eyebrows. You'll find tension in places you didn't even think about. Clear your mind. Thoughts will pop in your head to distract you. That's okay, distracting thoughts are a completely normal part of meditation, it doesn't mean you've messed up. Acknowledge the thought and dismiss it. It may help you to visualize the process with a metaphor of some kind, such as your brain is a lake and each thought is a ripple. A ripple isn't bad but you needn't watch it all the way to the shore. Let it drift away and focus on the calm it leaves behind. \n\nStay like this for a few minutes, then stop. Don't try too hard for your first time. Repeat this a few times over the next week or so, just a few minutes at a time. You'll probably feel much more relaxed and calm. Some people feel energized, some people feel sleepy, whatever you feel is okay. Everyone's brain is different and everyone meditates differently. \n\n___\n\nWhen you start getting a little better at clearing your mind, then you can start progressing into mindfulness. Don't advance too soon or you may get frustrated or at least discouraged at how difficult it is to keep your mind clear. First step is to genuinely and completely focus on your breathing. Start the breathing exercise like before. Once your mind is clear, pay attention to your body instead of your mind. Feel how the air feels as it rushes past your nostrils and lips. Feel the clothes shift on your torso as your chest expands and contracts. Feel the weight of your clothes on your shoulders and limbs. Feel your upper body move slightly up and down. Be *aware* of your body. This awareness, this attention to things that are usually so subtle and automatic they aren't noticed, this is mindfulness. \n\nAgain, don't try to hard. If focusing on your body distracts your mind, pause, deep breath, let the ripples drift away. Narrow your focus on just a small part of your body as you breathe, like your nostrils. If you keep getting distracted, again, that's okay. Don't feel like you've messed up. Each time a distraction pops up, your mind is doing what it does naturally. Each time you dismiss it, you are improving. Continue with this simple mindfulness exercise for a couple weeks, until you feel comfortable with it. Try to meditate at least a few minutes every other day, preferably daily for 5-15, even if you have to pretend you're pooping or something to get away.\n\nAs you improve, you can try being more mindful of more things at once. Feel the weight of your arms and legs on your chair, the slight movement of air around your exposed skin, the slight twitches and jerks of your body as blood is forced through your veins. Be aware of your whole body and everything it feels all at once. \n\n___\n\nContinued in next comment due to character limit.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "Maoman1", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486394338, "link_id": "t3_5sds30", "parent_id": "t3_5sds30", "distinguished": null, "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1488616469, "id": "ddeghpc", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "It should take you a couple weeks, up to a couple months to get to this point, if you've been practicing regularly. You almost certainly still constantly have distracting thoughts pop into your head mid-session but you can probably dismiss them quickly and easily. By now you can probably drop into a state of calm and within minutes pick up on everything your body feels. You have probably noticed how different environments, clothes, and positions effect your body. You can start working up to more difficult mindfulness practices. \n\nFirst, focus on your other senses. Open your eyes, look around, listen, smell. Always be calm and mindful. Notice each individual sound and separate them in your mind. Be aware of the direction each sound comes from and how you can also hear that sound on the other side of your head as it reflects off the wall. Relax your eyes and notice your whole periphery instead of the center of your vision. Try to simultaneously see things on the left and right without moving your eyes from a fixed place. Don't forget to be mindful of how your body feels, but now be mindful of the world around you as well as the the world within you.\n\nIf you're having a lot of difficulty, keep your eyes closed and try focusing on just your hearing. Once you have, go back to focusing on your body and try to be mindful of both body and sound at once. Then, open your eyes and focus on just your sight. Do that then add in your body, and when you're stable with both body and sight, add in sound as well. Keep it all present in your mind. Add in smell as well if you notice anything. Don't focus too specifically, just be aware of everything. \n\nThis will take some practice and vastly increase the difficulty in keeping your mind clear. You're throwing a lot more distractions at your mind, especially as we are sight-driven creatures, and you're trying to be mindful of many more things at once. This and the next step are separate because this is open meditation and the next step is focused meditation. If you don't enjoy this, feel free to try what I explain next instead of struggling with this too much.\n\n___\n\nThe real challenge is to focus on *how* you think instead of what you think. Once you feel settled in your trance, next distracting thought that comes up, focus on *that.* Pay attention to how you're thinking about it. Try to handle the thought and be aware of what it feels like to consciously control and manipulate a thought. Focus on any emotions the thought brings up and manipulate the emotion itself. Take a step back and focus on what it feels like to focus. Think about thinking. \n\nBeing mindful of your own thoughts, this layered focusing, is possibly the most difficult and most useful aspect of meditation and has by far the most depth. Meditation that focuses inside your head is the kind of meditation you can spend your whole life developing. Note that this isn't really mindfulness; mindfulness would be passively being aware of the thought without judgement and looking on it as if from above, like how you simply observe your body early in the meditation. This is more focused and controlled, actively manipulating and playing with the thoughts in your head, but personally I find it more useful because true mindfulness is good for making yourself serene. This will calm you as well as letting you *do* stuff, for example:\n\nYou can use this to help solve troublesome problems. Next time you have a difficult problem to solve, take a break from it, do something else for a short while, then go meditate on it. Settle in your trance then pull up your problem and examine your thought process. Think about how you're thinking about it. Turn it around and upside down in your head. Pull it apart. Don't try to solve it, just pay attention to it. Focus on it. The solution will often suddenly appear.\n\nNext time something very emotional happens, do the same thing. Meditate on what happened and wait for an emotion to arise. Take hold of that emotion and envelop it, don't let it overwhelm you. If it starts taking hold of you, let go, dismiss it, and go back to your trance. Try again. You should be able to look at the emotion with the same detached fascination as you do the weight of the clothes on your shoulders. Once you get a hold of it, follow the emotion down into your head. Find it's root and focus on why you feel that specific emotion. You'll often find it has an unexpected source that you weren't really thinking about, but once you realize the connection, it feels right. Now you can be mindful of that source, why it applies, how you feel and think about it, and what you desire of it.\n\n___\n\nAs your skill increases, you'll find a ridiculous amount of depth and subtlety that I couldn't possibly describe in text. You may learn to control aspects of your body that you probably thought were beyond your control. For example, I personally can focus on what feels to me like building energy and make myself warmer, or focus on what feels like pulling water into my head then flushing it away to make a headache and certain other aches and pains weaken or disappear entirely. You may also learn to seize hold of your emotions in the heat of the moment and rapidly regain composure and control yourself, stopping sobs or fury and regaining a calm, relaxed outlook, allowing you to address the problem properly rather than exploding on it in rage or despair. You can practice by doing something you know frustrates you, then once you start feeling the frustration build, try to focus on breathing and releasing the thought as quickly as possible. What you're doing is tapping into \"mind over matter.\" Placebos have a proven effect on your body, but where could the effect possibly come from except your own mind?

Then I started meditating, going to therapy, and taking Lexapro all at the same time.\n\nI don't know how much I can credit each solution, but I'm in a way better spot than I was 6 months ago and I attribute a lot of it to meditation. On Tuesdays there's a meditation class in m city where you go and this guy guides you into relaxation and you meditate for 30 minutes.\n\nThere's an app called Buddhify that has like, 50 different guided meditations to listen to. At first it's really hard. When I first started, my mind was a mile a minute. The way I think about it is that your brain finally has calm enough to process things you normally don't process. Usually I'm so distracted with Reddit, video games, TV, weed, alcohol, etc, that I didn't ever actually engage some thoughts that I had. After about a week, I got better at it and now I medidate for 15 minutes every day and I usually feel really good afterwards. \n\nI recommend to start with Jon Kabat-Zion videos on YouTube. He does mindfulness meditation which is very good for beginners. Eventually you'll get to the point where you don't need to listen to anything (which is almost where I'm at).\n\nIt's seriously great. On the offchance you live in SF, PM me and I'll tell you where the free meditation class is. If you don't, just start with YouTube or Buddhify.\n\nThe one thing I would like to add to the comment above me though: even if you get \"distracted,\" it's not necessarily a bad thing. Meditation is all about living in the moment and not thinking about anything outside of right now. Sounds, while they can be distracting, are part of the \"now,\" so things like traffic or someone in the other room moving around are a way to focus. However you should definitely avoid things like a TV/radio on, or conversation, as our brain automatically locks on to that stuff and takes us out of our moment.\n\nI strongly recommend giving it a shot.

It's a pretty good read, if you're looking for a guide to the history of the Soviets, as the Soviets saw it. \n\nIf you're looking for biographical information for the head honchos involved, then probably the best known would be Simon Montefiore's Young Stalin, and Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar. Although, there's also Robert Service's Stalin, Lenin, and Trotsky. You should also check out \"Another View of Stalin\" by Ludo Martens if for whatever reason, you're looking for a more sympathetic analysis.\n\nIf you're primarily interested in learning about the Gulags, then \"The Gulag Archipelago\" seems to be the gold standard, though I would also recommend Everyday Stalinism, by Sheila Fitzpatrick. \n\nIf you're interested in an economic history, then \"Farm to Factory\" by Robert C.

This book is objectively terrible. It is so filled with inaccuracies, exaggerations, outright lies, uncited claims, and rudimentary mathematical errors, that even the books publishers at Harvard University Press, have since admitted that it is not a valuable source. (They didn't do that until a communist group called the MIM basically made them, but they did it nonetheless.) In the years since it's initial publication, the author, Robert Conquest, has been revealed as a British Secret Service agent with a vested interest in writing as negative portrayal of Soviet society as possible. As such, several crimes were fabricated in order to make Stalin look worse than he actually was, and the actual crimes commited by the USSR in that period were exaggerated to a completely cartoonish extent. The only reason why I recommend that you read this book is that it spent several years as the primary source on Soviet history during this period, and for that reason, anyone else with an interest in the topic has already read it. You need to read it, just so you can adequately explain why it's bullshit.\n\nThe second recommendation I make with great caution, is the works of Grover Furr. They are perhaps the best known works of Stalin Apologia. Why I'm cautious to recommend them should be obvious. The reason why I recommend them, is that they offer a genuinely unique take on the period, and that they do a better job of debunking most of the bullshit that you'll read in BBOC than most of the non-communist books you'll read will.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "hositrugun1", "created_utc": 1486431297, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5shk6e", "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488631037, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5shk6e", "id": "ddfarh9"}, {"body": "look up people loving in there cars on YouTube.

The more you get excited about learning, the easier it will be!\n\nGeneral Advice: \n\nDo anything you can to get some kind of overarching structure to your education, plus something to show for it (i.e. a degree). Kahn academy is great for learning something specific and filling in knowledge gaps, but it's hard to plan your own education when you don't really know what it is that you'll be learning.  Having a community of people around you that are also learning (and that are excited about learning) can help keep you moving forward when you aren't feeling as motivated.  That being said, getting enrolled in some kind of program may not happen immediately, so its always good to learn what you can in the meantime!  Also, don't worry about making mistakes doing math - keep trying! as you continue, you'll get better at identifying when you have or haven't understood a concept.  Also, searching through your work to try to find an error is a really helpful learning tool, especially with math!  You can always post questions on reddit (I think there's a math homework subreddit...) if you are really stuck.\n\nStrategy for the future:\n\nI'm not sure where you're at and what your goals are so I can't make specific recommendations about what you should do with your life.  Even if I did know those things, you should take anybody's recommendations with a grain of salt and evaluate your options as well as you can.  Make your goal concrete and attainable, and then act.  Whatever your goals are, do as much research as you can to learn about all the different ways you can get the education you need and want.  In doing this research, you may find that your dream job is unrealistic given your circumstances, or that it simply won't exist by the time you are qualified to have it.  That's okay though, because in doing your research, you'll probably learn more about the opportunities that exist and possibly find an alternative goal that is perhaps more exciting AND more realistic.\n\nDon't give up!

Some of the easiest options would be to subscribe to a bunch of educational sub reddits and youtube channels that hold your interest. I used to be a complete dipshit, considering I'm a 5th grade drop out. Mommy thought it would help pulling me out of public schooling to protect me from bullies and have me in home schooling, but the problem was there was no schooling. I didn't get everything situated until I started binge studying for about two years for my GED, then after that I kinda just self studied for a moment on random subjects. I am in college, but what helped me the most come off as smart and even feeling smart was just not pressuring myself. I read what I wanted to read, I learned how to fact check, I learned how to be wrong, I learned what my interests were and how I learn and then exploited it. I like humor, so I Watch individuals like SamONella on youtube. I like obscure information, so I sometimes watch top ten lists from various channels, anything that catches my interests and I google for a more in depth experience. \n\n\nThe majority of people I come across feel like complete dumbasses now, I used to wonder why I felt everyone was so stupid surrounding me. The truth is, the reason is me. Because I kept absorbing so much educational materials on the internet, because I exploited my interests, I am by social standards smart. As far as actually being smart, I have quite the distance to go; that's what school is for. \n\n\nI am in college now, doing well... doing kinda okay sometimes. I am not really wired to being intelligent. Some people have it in them, I feel like I kinda lost that ability for simply not using those learning skills in the most crucial years of my life in developing them. However, like what you're going to struggle with, my biggest obstacle was discipline more than intelligence. You can be the dumbest sack of shit on the planet, but discipline will be the deciding factor of whether or not that changes. I, as someone that simply am not wired to being a good school student like possibly yourself as someone used to being a hard worker instead of a school person (both very different work ethics! I am a hard worker but a shit student!), needed to think of creative ways to better myself. \n\n\nIf I had to start over from where I was back when I only had a 5th grade education and was dumb as bricks, I would do the exact same thing. Binge watch your favorite youtubers, google words for definition EVERY time you see a word you're not 100% certain you understand and then force yourself to use the word as many times as you possibly can, and read as much as you can. I cannot, for my life, commit to reading books. It's hard to start from nothing, but I'm getting better! If you see a huge post discussing what's going on in the world or a point in history, read it. If you speed read and didn't retain most of it, don't beat yourself up and read the comments. You will get better as long you start. \n\n\nAs far as options go, it depends on what your path in life is. School loan debt is scary only if you don't have a plan. If you have a major that promises REAL jobs with REAL pay with REAL demand for workers, who gives a fuck about loan debt? Just have a realistic budget planned and paying loans every month isn't suddenly so bad, especially if you are making more money than you're used to. It's only hard if you go in without a plan. \n\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would look for as many financial options as  possible. The only struggle I can imagine you will endure is your current job, which might be a huge loss depending on what it pays. If your current life expenses requires a high paying job, you may need to reevaluate everything you're doing from how much you're spending and what you need to where you want to be and how you're going to do it. You need to hit the reset button, you need to subscribe to a certain level of game theory, a mindset of risk versus reward, a mindset that understands sacrifices for profits. When you can really mentally prepare yourself for this, you will then need to figure out what is the absolute minimum you can survive with a month and look for a job based on that and how much school grants, scholarships, and loans you can get. If you're really bad at school like I am, you might have to take the scary route of not working at all and building some loan debt. I currently am exhausted and suppose to be studying for a test, but because my job is working my ass off on my only days off, it's hard not to procrastinate on studying when this is my only downtime to relax. I personally will be quitting my job soon, but I will also be open minded about other jobs out there that are also minimum wage, but just aren't the work load I got currently at Pizza Hut. If you feel like your job will not let you work part time and you feel like your job will be an obstacle for your success because school will take so much concentration out of you, you might do the same. \n\n\nAgain, I don't know your situation 100%, but I am skeptical military is your ONLY option for schooling. School debt isn't bad as long your major isn't garbage.

It may not be easy but if you're determined you will surprise yourself at what you can accomplish. Someone very close to me was in a similar situation, they graduated high school with less than average grades. Skipping ahead a few years and they didn't apply to college until their mid 20's, starting at a community college for two years and then transferring to an engineering college. They earned a four year degree in engineering and received very good grades. It wasn't easy and they practically lived in the library but as long as you have the determination to drive you through it you will succeed. \n\nIt's very easy to get overwhelmed so it's important to take small steps and break everything up into small achievable goals. Starting off at a community college is a great way to get your foot in the door with the basic classes needed for almost every degree, just be sure to check if they will transfer to other schools you feel you might attend later on. \n\nIf you feel you're not confident enough to take basic classes there's a lot of online learning resources such as Alison that offer free classes where you learn at your own pace. I'm actually taking some math classes on Alison to refresh my memory and it's pretty great. \n\nDon't ever beat yourself up about not being educated either, leave the past behind you. Focus on today and the future, you could start writing your goals down on paper or keep a journal. There's something about writing things down that helps you visualize them and it keeps you motivated.

Educated professionals can and do work very hard just as often as menial or skilled laborers. Work is tough, that's why you have to get paid to do it. Here are some things to consider.\n\nGetting a college education is hard work. It is mentally taxing, and can regularly demand weeks of 60+ hours of brain \"work\". Your memory, focus, and reasoning will be taxed to the extreme.\n\nHaving a professional job is hard work. In today's america, hours are long and wages are stagnant across the board. If you are lucky enough to have a steady job with good benefits, it is probably salaried... you will not get paid for these extra hours. At all. Your boss will demand always more of your time and productivity for as little as they can compensate you. That's their job.\n\nHaving a leadership or senior role in a professional job is *hard work*. You **will** consistently work longer than 40 hour weeks, again not being paid hourly. It isn't an option. You shoulder the responsibility of other people's livelihood and often that of their safety as well. If you do a good job, well you've done what is expected of you. If something doesn't go right, it's definitely your fault. Everyone will blame you and demand you bend over backwards to appease them, or otherwise they will wish for and seek your resignation.\n\nDon't let a stereotype keep you down. Everyone works hard. You're doing the right thing trying to figure out how to work *smart* and make your career work for you.\n\n\nThat said, here's my short term advice: the internet is a gold mine of information. Just keep looking, keep trying to learn. YouTube is great, check out a channel called [CrashCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse). They've got series of animated videos that introduce topics to beginners.\n\nDon't be afraid to watch the same video more than once, or even move on in the series but come back later to refresh. Try pausing the video to take some simple notes. See if you can remember what your notes say, and then check your notes. Rewatch videos and compare your notes to the videos.\n\nMore importantly than learning the topics in the videos, these practices will help you get comfortable with how to learn. Don't expect too much too quickly; just keep at it and don't give up. You'll find your own learning style over time and eventually you will discover what interests you.

There are subtle but important distinctions between words like \"intelligent\" \"smart\" \"clever\" \"creative\" and so on.\n\nIntellect is the ability to understand and reason **objectively,** and is in some ways the sum of all the other words. \"Smart\" just means you've memorized information, but doesn't mean you can expand on it. \"Clever\" just means you can quickly grasp a new idea, but doesn't mean you can apply it elsewhere. \"Creativity\" is like the glue that binds it all together; it is the ability to bring existing ideas together to create something new, but it means little if there is a small library to begin with.\n\nIf you are committed to this, then the \"paper knowledge\" will come, but what you can start RIGHT NOW is practicing your ability to incorporate what you know in different fields of study, and learning how to be critical of what you are *learning* and what you *already know.* You should be judging new information as it comes to you for its validity, and asking yourself if you can come up with anything that you already know that can be augmented or disproved by it (just as important, is there anything you already know that can disprove this new thing or make it better?). You would be surprised how some things can relate to each other when their respective schools of thought are at first glance completely meaningless.\n\nWith bland stuff like mathematics, all you can probably do for now is practice equations in your head for a while and come up with ways to group, break down, and use the numbers. \n\nWith concepts or news or politics or anything like that, you can get a huge start by asking yourself a few important questions:\n\n\"That's interesting, if it's true\" - You're considering the value of the thing for what it is, regardless of what you already know. \n\n\"Is it true?\" - Now that you've understood it for what it is, you need to determine whether its valid in the first place. Academic validity comes from figuring out if it's **CRAAP:**\n\n* Currency: Is the source current? A book on construction cost analysis is pretty straightforward, but if it was written in 1967 it's useless because it's based on a bygone economy that has been upended by inflation and advances in fabrication.\n\n* Reliability: Is the source reliable? This is pretty straightforward. \n\n* Accuracy: Is the source accurate? Almost EVERY SINGLE news story going \"a study says (some obviously unhealthy food) may actually make-you-thin, save-you-money, make-you-smarter, and bring-your-dad-back-to-life\" is absolute bullshit because they've taken mountains of data (if the study itself is even good in the first place) and generalized it into a punchline.\n\n* Authority: Is the source of the information authoritative? An intern who gave you fully designed floor plan of a house on a clean paper and professional letterhead may be nice, but I would much rather pursue the house sketched on a napkin by the principal architect.\n\n* Point of View: You must always consider from what background the source comes from. If a scientist is telling you something about quantum dynamics, you can probably trust him. If he starts talking about the ethics of veganism, it doesn't mean he should be disbelieved, but you should \"take it with a grain of salt.\" If a coal miner is telling you that global warming is a myth, you know that there is a conflict of interest, but maybe he still has something valuable to say; you simply have to asterisk what he's saying by reminding yourself that he comes from an industry that has a vested interest in rejecting the concept entirely.\n\nFinally, you need to ask yourself: \"If it's true, why?\" - You need to understand what makes something true in the first place. It is not enough to accept someone else's conclusion, you need to be able to come to that same conclusion based on what you know as well and what you've just learned. Years down the line, you still may come across new information that can add to your understanding of this thing or invalidate it entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore going crazy with reading dry knowledge stuff, just read much more of what you like this year (unless it is tabloid crap or about politics). It will still expand your vocabulary, your ability to frame and communicate ideas, and your ability to sit and read.\n\nWhen you start getting into stuff like \"1984\" or \"Brave New World\" to be able to comment on the politics of today for example, you also have to remember not to take these concepts and blanket them to the world and say \"this is what things are now\" or \"this is definitely where things could go\" because it's easy to get caught up and excited about them.\n\nI'll leave you with three quotes from a book that got me started in realizing one of the best ways I've been able to consider things for years now. From *101 Things I learned in Architecture School:* \"An architect knows something about everything, an engineer knows everything about one thing,\" \"A good designer isn't afraid to throw away a good idea [if it isn't wholly applicable to the current setting,]\" and **most importantly** \"The most effective, most creative problem solvers engage in a process of meta-thinking, or 'thinking about the thinking'\"\n\nMeta-thinking means that you are aware of *how* you are thinking as you are *doing* the thinking. Meta-thinkers engage in continual internal dialogue of testing, stretching, criticizing, and redirecting their thought processes.\n\nCriticize your perspective, but don't criticize yourself. You want to be better and if you keep that simple fact in mind for every new decision, option, and data point that presents itself to you throughout THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, it will always serve you well. \n\nFrom this moment forward, I am proud of you, and you should be proud of you as well. You have begun the journey; there is no destination other than progress for progress' sake.\n\nGood luck.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "calafragilistic", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1486452750, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_5sj73z", "distinguished": null, "score": 17, "retrieved_on": 1488637456, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_5sj73z", "id": "ddfo2ys"}, {"body": "I only read the one I mentioned.

For instance, I've tried to wrap my mind around the way volts, ohms, and amps relate to each other and I can't grasp it. But I live among working guys like you who swim in that stuff every day.

How do advise him to go from motion control to a regular controller? Smh. \n\nHere's some real tips. Assuming you've never played FPS shooters before. I'm referring to Call of Duty. \n\nStart at a low sensitivity(2 or 3). Practice running around in a custom private map with no bots. Running. Turning. Crouching. Going prone. Just do it over and over. Aim at random spots throughout the map. \n\nPretend there's someone peeking out the window and \"aim\"  to the window. Just get the overall feel of how to look around with your right stick, and how to move forward/backwards/sideways, and sprinting with your left stick. \n\nIt may be confusing at first because you don't know which thumb is to do what. Once you're comfortable and have a feel of the game mechanics of running around, aiming, sprinting and etc. That's when you start to bring in the bots. \n\nIn the settings you can set match type/game mode to free for all, about 10 bots, and set the health to 150%. Setting the health a bit higher takes longer to kill, which means more practice staying on target and aiming. \n\nHere's what you're going to do. You're going to aim on the bots and strafe left and right without shooting. This tip right here is what 99% of those tip trick videos on YouTube are missing. \n\nYou need to get a feel for the aim assist. Just strafe back and forth and observe how sticky the aim assist is, and get an idea of how much to strafe to stay locked on. Then slowly get a feel how to counter it. What I mean is when you strafe left with the left stick, aim right a little with the right stick. \n\nAfter you get that down, start shooting now. Run around, aim at a bot, strafe a little and shoot. After all this is done, it should take you about 2 or 3 weeks to get somewhat used to it. \n\nAnd from there onward, it's all about map awareness, paying attention to the radar for enemies(they show up as a red dot), go to the area where you're teammates aren't at to find enemies. Also, after you get used to the 2 or 3 sensitivity you've been practicing on, bump it up one more. I play on 4 sensitivity, 4/4 for the newer Call of Duty games. I don't recommend going past 5 or 6, otherwise your aim will be all over, and the aim assist will feel much weaker. \n\nMost important, just have fun. And don't listen to the 12 year olds talking about your mother. Just mute them all.

Practice speaking. One of the most important classes I ever took in college was a speech class. It was a degree requirement and I think that was smart because it's such a useful skill. \n\nOne tip I used to use and still pull out if I have occasion to give any kind of public speech or presentation is to use the webcam on my computer and record myself giving the speech. In school sometimes they'd record out speeches like this too and maybe you've experienced that before as well. They also often speak in front of a mirror. But I really love the webcam thing because you have the advantage of being able to really watch yourself afterwards and look at what is working and what isn't. You could write a speech, speak off the cuff, or try reading famous speeches or poems. But really read it like you have an audience and record yourself. Maybe save a few of your videos and over time compare to see how you're improving. \n\nIf you can somehow take an actual speech class it's worth it. You may also try checking for free online courses like at Coursera or ITunes U or whatever. I know there's some free communication classes on there. Might be worthwhile though the bummer of those is you're missing the best aspect of the speech class I ended up loving in college which was actually writing and giving speeches to the class and getting feedback. I'm sure there are books to read as well on the subject but I feel like a class or some kind of audio or video lesson in particular is most beneficial for this because there's so much about speaking well that obviously is hard to describe or take in from a text but easier to understand from a video or audio clip. Maybe search YouTube. Definitely do use YouTube to watch other people. But don't just watch for fun but to look at what those people are doing well and maybe what they aren't also. TED talks are pretty useful for this. Also helpful to know that if I'm not mistaken the TED videos are all official and the TEDx ones from different places are more groups of people who got together to do it in their area. So the TED folks are more heavily professionals of varying degrees whereas with TEDx you're more likely to see people who aren't so good or comfortable at speaking or maybe aren't as interesting (in sure you are aware that how a person speaks is in itself perhaps the biggest reason someone is interesting to listen to or not. Really great speakers can make the most monotonous subject seem exciting and interesting). So I'd look for both the good and the bad. I think it is just important to watch bad speakers and be able to recognize what it is they don't do well. \n\nPractice though, is probably most important. More than watching or reading. The only way you'll get better is with practice. Talk more to friends even, say hello to strangers (even if, maybe especially if, it's hard), really use every opportunity you have to practice and improve even if that's just a two minute exchange with the cashier at the grocery store or something. And if you do have a webcam or even one on your phone or whatever, definitely record yourself. \n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "Tzipity", "created_utc": 1486541926, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5sp5bt", "distinguished": null, "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1488667005, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5sp5bt", "id": "ddhag71"}, {"body": "The one thing that changed my outlook on gaming is:\n\n\"Git Gud Noob.

Memorizing poems for recitation.  I don't do it publicly, this is all my own time and \"for me\".  And they're not even special, terribly \"meaningful\" poems.  I dislike a lot of poetry - read a poetry book and for every 50 poems you might find one that sort-of piques an interest.  Now-a-days I am getting better at finding poetry to memorize, it's more about what I want memorized, or what kind of challenge i want.\n\nBut... Poets tend to lust after elaborate vocabulary.  And they tend to have (traditional poetry more-so than free-verse) the knowledge to arrange complicated sentence structures.  This drives things like pacing, annunciation, emphasis.  \n\nReciting a poem well requires you to slow down, to be practiced, to be able to \"flow\" your voice and the emotional emphasis you put behind the words, according to the given part of the story you're telling.  \n\nHonesty, to be sure, I'm not sure this helps me in the day to day.  I have never had but one problem communicating - and that is rushing through sentences.  I can bobble my words and stumble.  I'll often have to physically stop, tell myself to slow down, and then restart with a mental slow tick-tick-tick to keep my tongue and brain at the same speed.   *This* might be a better tool for you, though it doesn't necessarily help with inflection and monotones.\n\n\nAnyhow...

Clutter is the worst. The easiest way to keep this looking tidy is to simply have less stuff. Ask yourself if you really need to hang onto used sheets of paper, broken pencils or empty boxes. Get rid of stuff you don't use. \n\n2. Everything has a place. Everything should have a place where it belongs. I personally only use/need either ONE pen or ONE pencil at a time so I only require one of each to be available. On the other hand my son prefers to have a bunch when not in use they belong in a pen cup on his desk. Notebooks get put in his backpack or a bin on a shelf. Everything not bolted down gets put in a bin. \n\n3. Clean as you go. It's a lot easier to concentrate on one thing at time. Personally, I like to clean from top to bottom. Start with the highest horizontal surface in your room and work your way down. Clear off that top shelf (is everything orderly on the shelf?), clear off your desk (all the pens and paper put away?), clear off the bed (no clothes on the bed! make your bed!), clear off the bed (again, no clothes! nothing, unless it is furniture)   \n\n4. Check your surfaces. This applies to ALL you horizontal surfaces shelves, tables, desks, *beds and *floors. Ask yourself, \"Is there a better (better = invisible) place for that?\"    \n\n5. Make your bed. The bed takes up so much space in a room that not making it brings the tidiness level down a few notches. BTW a properly made bed WILL NOT have wrinkles.\n\n6. Vacuum. If you have carpet, vacuum it. Hard floors? Sweep the floor.  Move stuff out of the way to clean. Make sure to get under desks, tables and beds. \n\nHope that helps.

You never ever want to sneak up on a bear. If they hear you coming from a distance, chances are they will leave the area, as they don't want confrontation either. If you spot a bear who has yet to notice you, back away slowly, always facing it. Never suddenly yell out, as it will become startled, and may come towards you. That being said, if he's noticed you and standing on his hind legs to get a better view/smell you out, speak in a loud, aggressive voice while slowly waving your arms above your head, almost like you're signalling an airplane. This is commonly known as the \"Hey bear, woah bear\" technique. You might be frozen with fear, and unable to come up with words, so that's a good default.\n\nIf you're very unlucky and meet a territorial bear, or you've spooked one and they're coming at you, they might attempt to do what is called a bluff charge. It will run to within meters of you, and break off. If you have bear spray, you wait until the last possible moment to light that motherfucker up, as typical spray only reaches 2-3 meters. Ideally you want to be spraying in the same direction as the wind, to not be blinded, but that's not going to be your top priority. So if you don't have bear spray, and he's still bluffing you, keep backing away while he's gearing up for his next round. There's a chance he might break off and decide to leave you be. If he doesn't stop and completes the charge, you've got to fight with every last bit of energy you may have. Swing at his eyes and nose, and if you've got a knife/walking stick/shovel/ect and have it ready, focus on his face and head. Chances are he's going to fuck you up good, but you need to fight back with a black bear, just do your best to fuck him up back.\n", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "MixGasHaulAss", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486585695, "link_id": "t3_5srn7c", "parent_id": "t3_5srn7c", "distinguished": null, "score": 14, "retrieved_on": 1488682527, "id": "ddi29ko", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "Be smarter than a panther.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "tyrcian", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486586634, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_5srn7c", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488683004, "id": "ddi3487", "link_id": "t3_5srn7c", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/wiki/getting_started) is probably a good place to start.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "masterofkittens", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486587388, "link_id": "t3_5sb911", "parent_id": "t3_5sb911", "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488683388, "id": "ddi3smy", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "#1 learn to use a [tracking point rifle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ugXRaVmXT4).  \n#2 kill bear from 500 miles away  \n#3 enjoy your new bearskin rug", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "Bonchee", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": 1486588216, "created_utc": 1486587694, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5srn7c", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488683539, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddi42kk", "link_id": "t3_5srn7c", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "*everyminute", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "Bonchee", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486587745, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t1_ddhjhkk", "score": 5, "retrieved_on": 1488683565, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddi447x", "link_id": "t3_5srn7c", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "lol. the point wasn't to brag, but to encourage OP to self-teach instead of getting discouraged about not having a college degree.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "wesleyoneal", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486587844, "link_id": "t3_5sj73z", "parent_id": "t1_ddhxuds", "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488683616, "id": "ddi47f5", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "You're being fairly aggressive about this for no reason.

Depending on whether you play console or PC I can give you some tips...\nThe most important thing with aim is that you want to find ways that you can grip your controller/mouse that give you the most control and flexibility. If you do not have control, you have no accuracy, and if you don't have flexibility you will be slow and unresponsive.\n - For console, buy kontrol freeks - they increase the distance it takes to move the thumbstick per count, giving you a lot more control over the thumbstick. The other thing is to make sure you tense your thumb up a little bit (but not so much that it inhibits your flexibility - remember that flexibility is important for aim just as much as control).\n - For PC, first make sure you are using the correct gear - get yourself a big ass mousepad, get a desk and supporting chair at the proper height, a high refresh rate monitor, a mechanical ergonomic keyboard and obviously get a gaming mouse with a good optical sensor (any 3366 sensor will be fine). Okay, so physiologically you want to make sure you are pivoting on your elbow/forearm and not with your wrist - it's the same concept as the kontrol freeks which increase the distance you have to control your aim and pivoting on your wrist can cause carpal tunnel. The interesting thing with the mouse is that when you swipe you actually make a curve and not a straight line and even though you make a curve with your mouse, you will actually be making a straight line on the screen/in-game (trippy). Just make sure your wrist is straight and locked. When it comes to vertical aiming you just lift your arm a little bit cause otherwise the friction of your arm will cause you to stutter. If the friction is really bad you should wear a long sleeve shirt while you play.\n - Once you understand the physiological aspect to aim, the best thing you can do is practice and just keep an eye on your gaming posture. You can practice in game or if you can find something like csgo's aim training maps then you can use them too. Just try not to start too high with the sensitivity and only increase your sensitivity one notch at a time. Just keep working up over time until you get to a fairly high sensitivity and then stop changing your sensitivity and start working on your muscle memory. At about this point you should be pretty good at FPS gaming and then the more you practice the more professional you will become. Just make sure to convert your sensitivity between games otherwise you will fuck up your muscle memory. It might be hard to do on console, but for PC you can use a website called mousesensitivity.com to convert sensitivities between different fields of view - make sure to convert by monitor distance and not by cm/360 as the perceived sensitivity will be different for different FOVs (keep in mind that this also applies to console, but since console does not have a conversion tool you may have to guesstimate which sensitivity to use some times... one reason why I play PC).\n\n- Similar to aim, if you play PC you want to make sure you have your key bindings set in stone. You want to make sure your key bindings are the same for each game you play. Obviously it's hard since there are so many different genres with different actions but try and be consistent cause otherwise you'll accidentally press a key you've been using from a different game. Muscle memory is key.\n\n- Okay so once you have aim downpat you can start working on tactics. The reason why you should work on aim first is because you want your muscle memory to develop otherwise you'll dedicate too much of your focus to your aim but then thinking about tactics will just slow you down and you won't get anywhere. You want your aim to be second nature. You honestly are still learning some tactics subconsciously while you get your aim downpat and having lots of fun in the process so don't sweat it yet.\nIn terms of tactics you should study things like positioning, taking wider angles, learning spawns, holding choke points, stuff like that (it all depends on the game though). If you are interested in learning good general FPS tactics you should look up TheWarOwl on Youtube... honestly just google and watch everything you can, ask around with the pros and eventually you'll learn heaps about gaming tactics. Always look at what the pros are doing. Analyse everything they do.\n\n\nI'm sure there is a lot of other FPS gaming tips I could tell you but I can't remember at this moment in time.

If you think it's big enough, you're half done.  Big goddamn pit.\n\nSecond, you need to build a fire in the bottom of the pit.  You'll want it to cover the bottom of the pit, so make sure you get out of the hole before you light it.  Let it burn until it's nothing but ashes.\n\nNow, you need to bait the trap.  Bears are omnivores, they'll eat all sorts of things, but a lot of other creatures also eat most of those things.  You're after a bear, not deer, not hawks, a bear.  I suggest using snow peas.  They don't have a strong scent, so other animals won't get there first, and they grow during the winter, making them a relatively common option immediately following hibernation.  If snow peas grow in your area, most of the bears have probably conditioned themselves into feeling hungry when they see them.

Look up the basic rules first via YouTube tutorials until you understand the general idea of how to play. It's hard to get an actual group of people together enough to practice as much as you need to get good so it leaves you with either playing cash games at casinos or playing paper games online. First option isn't wise if you're just learning the game so stick with PokerStars NJ. They have a decent client and you can mess up without losing that much. Next, you'll want to learn about opening hands. The biggest problems beginners have is playing too many hands, so look up a starting hand chart. The next step is to read a ton of articles about strategy on PokerNews.com  so you can ditch the starting hand charts and understand the theory behind decisions. What you're going to come across first are pot-odds and \"counting your outs\". These refer to calculating probability of winning a pot vs. the payoff, and calculating the probability you have of beating hands as they come up (respectively). You'll learn about player behavior next (LAG's, TAG's, rocks) and subsequently begin to overthink every move everyone is making. This is where most beginners get caught up and quit because you're no longer playing poker, you're playing the other players. I urge you to stick with it and advance to higher tiers. These tiers could either be playing tournaments/ cash games at casinos or online (dependent on where you live). This is the most i'm willing to explain at this point. PM me if you wanna play together or need help setting anything up.

So find a neutral time not in the moment to really try and have an open discussion about it. Your friends may or may not be able to help you. I know some people are just better and more able to discuss and explain the actual issue than others but obviously something you're doing is making them uncomfortable.

Does that person need something done in the office? Are they bored? Are they lonely?  In many cases, you can find ways of alleviating this for them in a way that works to your favor: \"Oh yeah, I can take care of that, talk soon\"/ \"hey I'm really busy right now, I don't have time to chat at the moment\"/ \"listen, have you asked [the boss(someone else)] about this?\"\n\nActing busy (being busy) is the best way towards limiting contact with coworkers you dislike.  It gives them a valid reason for ignoring them while improving your own image in their mind (as a hard worker, etc.).\n\nIf you want to try and change your own attitude towards them (which is never a bad idea), you might apply some of these techniques towards yourself and your own attitude: \"What problem do I have with this person?\"/ \"Why do they bother me?\"/ \"What do *I* need right now?\"\n\nI hope this helps.

One of the questions that struck me - hard - was thinking of something that upset you during the day - someone ran a light in front of you, someone was rude at the office, your spouse didn't do the dishes -- and ask yourself \"How could a nice person have got themselves into that situation?\"\n\nIt doesn't ask that you think the person who did the thing is nice. Or ask you be NICE to that person in return, it just asks you, briefly, to turn your brain's imagination on and create a scenario where a normal, nice person, could have done the thing that upset you.\n\nSounds like hog-wash, right? I know, it really does.  And yet, I discovered that by doing this, I turned myself towards a more compassionate view of the world, regularly.  Some subs here have a phrase in the post box \"Remember the Human\". \n\nMaybe a person who cut me off in traffic is late to pick up his children because he pulled a double as a single parent.  Maybe a coworker could be rude to me at the office because she's stressed out due to her mother's recent breast cancer diagnosis.  Maybe a husband didn't do the dishes - not because he's petty and angry at me, but because he's worried about his job security at work and distracted himself with a video game to cope. \n\nYou're not forgiving someone, or excusing their upsetting behavior. You're not confronting anyone.  You are, however, taking a moment to change how you view the world.\n\nIf you find that, your entire life, you struggle with low emotional quotient, you may need to employ a therapist to help you develop appropriate internal coping skills.  If every job you have, you end up leaving due* to 'bad coworkers' and 'bad management' it may be that you have unreasonable expectations of your fellow humans.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author": "kaliena", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1486754964, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5t718s", "distinguished": null, "score": 15, "retrieved_on": 1488741166, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5t718s", "id": "ddl3bhc", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "Me too, you kind stranger :) ", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "creagrox", "created_utc": 1486755784, "link_id": "t3_5t89i9", "parent_id": "t1_ddkugg6", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1488741525, "controversiality": 0, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "ddl4086"}, {"body": "Sent", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "AnOddOtter", "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1486756024, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_ddl4086", "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1488741632, "id": "ddl47hn", "link_id": "t3_5t89i9", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Me too plzzz!!", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "ImaginePineapples", "link_id": "t3_5t89i9", "created_utc": 1486757136, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": "t1_ddkugg6", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1488742108, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "ddl54x2"}, {"body": "wood carve.

Everything you need is out there, if you'll only sit down to read. Rewarding and *fun* area you're testing the waters of. /u/Lampshader just directed you towards probably the perfect portal to explore further. \n\nLook up the water analogy, it might help associate some of the ideas a bit better. If you get stuck, sometimes just trying to think about it differently can make all the difference. \n\nNow, pick yourself a project; one which is cheap and -especially for the first few- easy looking. Grab a cheapy soldering iron from Amazon. Hakko has some on there. If you can find a little Weller pen with a hoof tip for no more than $25 I highly recommend. I'm a fanboy for my Weller at work. \n\nGet solder (you won't need much to start with.) I'd say get some with lead in it, flux cored. I know - Lead. Don't breathe the fumes. The lead helps wet the component surfaces so the tin can flow easier, making a nice, shiny joint. Some day, try some with a little silver in it. Then try Lead-free, and experience just how different (and sometimes frustrating!) it makes things.\n\nA breadboard is indispensible. When you graduate from your first few projects (kits are real nice, cuz you not only get a full BOM, but most times instructions too!) go ahead and get a breadboard, maybe a tube of real flux, some wick, and some protoboards.\n\nYou get to decide how quickly you progress with this! One day, choose a project which remains simple, but emphasizes an introduction to new theory. Make a little transistor LED blinker to study transistor logic! Make a NiChrome wire glow by switching a larger current with a smaller one (MOSFETs!), Make shit do other shit, because it's pretty much magic. \n\nAnd learn. Learn the whole time. One day maybe graduate to microcontrollers and FPGAs, and open up a job-producing, product-innovating business of your own!\n\nHave fun!\n\nEdit: Lol!

Not to say you shouldn't read Being and Nothingness, but its a little like reading the whole Bible vs. just reading the gospels if you wanted to understand the Christian message for example.\n\nI also cannot recommend enough Walter Kaufmann's Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre.

What caused it? Why is it happening?  What are the contributing factors? Think about \"the who, what, where, when, why, and how\" of your situation.   Is there a picture that is being painted by all of these contributing factors? What actions could be taken to help resolve each of the contributing factors?   Do any of these resolving actions work together?   Are the steps for resolution coming together?   Try thinking of multiple ways that you could solve each problem.   Can we \"outsmart\" this problem or are we going to have to \"brute force\" it?\n\n From there you might be able to determine an effect that may come with each one of these resolutions.   Normally, only very simple problems are solved without any rippling effects. Normally there are consequences for even the best solutions to problems.   Try to determine which consequences are the most  desirable. \n\n\"if we resolve the problem with X, then it might cause Y to happen.

Identifying what's really going on under the surface is hard- no one wants to actually deal with stuff they're \"not supposed to feel.\" \n\nAnger is an automatic response at first, but you can control it. You can acknowledge the feeling, allow yourself to feel it, and then let it go because it more than likely will not serve you well.

I hope this helps:\nWhen I was 18 I had pretty low emotional intelligence, although that manifests itself in different ways for different people. For me it was that I was not aware of my own emotions, in retrospect it was like I didn't have any.  It was partially due to being raised with a father who would not show emotion other than frustration, which was a defense mechanism due to baggage in his past.  It was his way of not letting anyone hurt him, he would just shut off the \"negative\" feelings so he couldn't be hurt. I mimicked this behavior. The problems were; \n\n1. You can't just turn off the \"negative\" emotions, trying to do this will dull all of them. \n\nThe only way I can describe it was that I felt grey.  Almost like I wasn't existing, I didn't mind in the time because it felt like home, but it was extremely lonely in retrospect. It isolated me.  With time I had to learn to identify emotions. That part me was hidden behind walls so thick that I couldn't even recognize when I felt something. \n\n2. There are no negative emotions. Emotions aren't good or bad, they're just giving is information. An emotionally mature person understands that hurt, anger, sadness, etc... are just as important. \n\nFor me, I was a hardcore \"thinker\" (vs feeler) I would even think instead of feel my emotions. \"I shouldn't let that make me angry\", \"I should happy right now\", \"I'm not going to let that bother me\".  It took me quite a while to be able to identify it, allow it, then be curious about it. By this I mean, \"okay.. I'm pissed, but why am I pissed? Its because deep down I view x as an injustice\" then allowing myself to be pissed, because it's okay to be pissed. \n\nThe following advice is not often heeded, but I like to give it anyway. I was lucky, I had access to free counseling from the time I was 18-25. I went not thinking I needed anything, just wanting to improve myself in case there were any small things I was missing (man, I was ignorant!). If you have the means, see a counselor! It's sometimes awkward at first but I think everyone should. It's the best thing that's ever happen to me as far as emotional health goes.

I grew up in poverty, in Appalachia (near VA Tech).  I suffer PTSD which was brought on by some traumas that happened to me at an early age and later on in adult life.  I was abused as a young child (non-sexual).  I have lost four best friends to suicide at a young age.  We all did a lot of acid and weed and drinking.  Pretty excessive.  Later in my teens an aunt lured me into a sexual situation that I wasn't comfortable with and I ran home.  Around that same time I ran away from home with a girlfriend one day and went half way across the country with no money except for fuel.  I've been shot at by an uncle, and I've seen family members die.  The last instance was that I found an uncle (not the one that shot at me) standing at the sink dead in his kitchen.  He was cold and I couldn't see his face.  He was just slumped over, still standing there with his face kind of hidden by the counter and sink.  Now I can't go near a fucking sink without having a mini freak out.  I've also seen my father attempt suicide and survive.  My therapist says that she believes, without a doubt, that I suffer PTSD.  \n\nAfter I found my uncle, I moved to a new city with my wife and I've just kind of given up on being normal and getting out into society.  I go to the bar, but I won't go into a mall or grocery.  I'm unable to function normally.  I don't have work because I'm not networking and pushing my services the way I should be.  Patient and loving wife is helping me get work with my video editing at times.  We are fine financially.  I'm in therapy and we are in the phase where I open up and tell the therapist about my life and we do breathing.  She has explained to me several techniques to control my anxiety.  The breathing works as good as my Ativan, so I hope to be able to get off of the medicine soon.  I dot like drugs anymore, after my experiences early in life.\n\nWhen I'm in public and having an attack, I need to know that someone will help me.  Just be let them know that everything will be alright.  Have them do some square breathing, with a modifier.  Not as hard as it seems.  \n\nTake a long breath in, hold it for a second or so, let it out through pursed lips slow and steady.  Do this for as long as it takes.  While they're doing that, have them think of a routine thing, like counting backward from 30 by threes.  These two things together, the steady slow breaths and the routine (counting backward) work to tell the lizard portion of the brain that everything is as it should be, no danger.  \n\nWhat is happening when I have overpowering anxiety is that I become suddenly hyper aware of myself and how people might be thinking of me.  I don't want to appear to be having a crisis, because that will draw attention from strangers, which I do not want.  So I am doing things inside my head which make it worse, and eventually I'll start showing outwardly and then the attack happens.  When that happens, I may have palpitations that further cause panic, so I need to get my shit together fast.  Best way is for me to sit quietly, or isolated, buit not too far from people in case something bad happens.  It would be good for someone very patient and understanding to accompany me, not to tell me to stop worrying, or to talk about my attack, but to help me to immediately start telling my lizard brain that everything is going to be OK.  So, if you see someone panic, or have an attack, just go let them know you're there and ask them to breathe with you.  You will be appreciated and your help.  If they ask you to leave, then leave, but do hang around a bit to check on them.  They may need medical help if they can't get their shit together.  That's my advice, as one that has panic attacks.  That's how I would do it, because that would work for me.  I'm no expert outside of my own experience.\n\n-edit- sorry about the fucked up grammar.

So as a respiratory therapist this is a common thing that I see at work. \n\nWhen you go through a panic attack you're breathing off too much CO2 so your levels get low. When they get low you're body responds but constricting capillaries in your lungs and it contributes to the tight chest feeling. The science behind it is that, as your CO2 levels get low your blood pH changes and the capilaries have a chemical change that drives constriction. As your capillaries are constricted there is less surface area for gas exhange to occur between your alveoli and capillary space (the place of gas exchange in your lungs), thus the body attempting to hold onto CO2. Also you get tingling feelings everywhere as a CNS response. When you have higher levels of CO2 as you can imagine the capillaries do the opposite they dilate and relax. \n\nSo what do we do when we have panic attacks is put a brown bag to your face and cover your mouth and nose and rebreathe your CO2. Extra levels of CO2 in your body also creates a sedation effect. \n\nThe military uses military breathing for snipers and the idea behind it is to build up CO2 and O2 levels by:\nInhale 4sec\nHold breath 4sec\nExhale 4sec\nHold breath 4sec\n\nThis forces your body to slow down the breathing a build CO2.

Back in May last year I was in between jobs for about a month and I thought I'd use the time constructively to do so many things. Boy was I wrong; the more free time I have, the less I do with it. That's a personal realization.\n\nSimilarly, I'm really driven by external motivators like friends, attention, etc. The point is I can arrange my life accordingly and harness this to push myself forward. So, my new roommate and I (as of August) go to the gym ~5 days a week before work at the crack of dawn. I know that I don't have the option to hit snooze because he's expecting me upstairs ready to go at 6:20 and I'm letting him down if I roll over. That works for me.\n\nSimilarly, my latest project is an [email newsletter](https://www.theworldincontext.com) that breaks down what's going on in the world each morning, so I have an audience that expects it every Mon-Fri in their inbox, and I'm letting them down if I don't follow through on that.\n\nI think it's key to do some reflection and figure out how you operate, what motivates and drives you, and play towards those strengths. Similarly, what gets you in a rut? Like for me, if I fall behind on something then it starts to weigh on me and I get anxious when I think about it. That results in avoidance of the problem/email/whatever it is.

I have had countless people say it, and I bet it feels really good to pretend you're changing someone's life with the least effort possible, but it just does nothing but make the receiver feel more worthless than before.\n\nFor myself, the main issue is that I have an idea of what I want to accomplish, and partway through it starts to feel like it's not going to pay off. Whatever I am doing is not giving me the results I want, and it's not going to turn out the way I imagined. This is where I usually stop and move on to the next project.\n\nI'm not sure what you are specifically dealing with, but if you are having trouble getting started, I would try writing down what you are going to do. You can set a reminder or put a sticky note somewhere you won't miss it. This will add some accountability, that you said you would do this and you are repeatedly seeing it there.\n\nMake time to do the thing. Plan a certain day and time when you want to get this done. You can plan for just 5 or up to 15 minutes. Maybe even 2 minutes! This will help you prepare mentally beforehand, you are expecting to do this task at that time. You won't stress about getting it done earlier because you know exactly when it's going to happen.\n\nVisualize the result. Think about why you are going to do it, and imagine how you will feel after it's done. You can even try to see yourself doing the task, going through the motions in your mind to relieve some of the fear that you have of doing something new and unusual. Studies like [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14998709) show that just imagining yourself doing a task can improve your skills almost as much as actually doing the physical task.\n\nMost importantly, remember that it's okay if you don't succeed. Don't beat yourself up about not accomplishing things. I believe that nothing you do reflects on your value as a person, so there is no way to raise or lower that value.

Or $100 per stock you are interested in (or one share of Tesla).  Buy one or two stocks and get your feet wet and reserve your paper trading account for bigger stock plays so you can simulate what would happen.  My greatest advice to you is \"buy low, sell high.\"  Just because \"solar is on the rise\" doesn't mean that Tesla stock will benefit greatly from it--there are many other factors that go into the Tesla stock going higher.  You want to learn something quick?  Check out Tesla's stock history--see anything unusual?  It's had two previous highs: 9/2014, 7/2016, both at 280 pps, where it currently sits today.  History tends to repeat itself in the stock market, so you should consider this the \"high\" part of \"buy low, sell high\".  Historically, it is likely that the price will drop back down to the mean, but if the stock price breaks passed let's say 290, then this is unprecedented territory and will likely climb higher (people are bullish).  There are so many ways to break down a stock and what will happen to it in the future, but it's best to do so through practice.  Here are my best tips:\n\n*Buy low, sell high\n\n*Believe in the company or product you are putting your money into\n\n*Do not read the news on stocks (speculation), read the reports and learn about the fundamentals of company.\n\n*Buy on the rise, do not try and time dips.\n\n*And never put in money you cannot lose.\n\n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author": "youneedproofs", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1487043061, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5tvkte", "distinguished": null, "score": 14, "retrieved_on": 1488827093, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5tvkte", "id": "ddptz9k", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "I have a good amount invested in Altium.

One is you will have a chain of accomplishment that can be motivation going forward, and two you will have a disciplined start to your day that can help you as your day progresses.

Check for commissions. Should be as low as possible or they'll eat up too much of your trades.\n- Pick a stock and a stock exchange - for Germany, I go with Xetra mostly, but you can find bank accounts that let you trade on e.g. NYSE directly. A lot of stocks are traded worldwide - at least these you should probably start with ;)\n- Buy it. If you buy, set a limit. Never buy \"market\". This will keep the actual price you pay at bay and prevent \"slippage\". Besides commissions, that's the other part potentially driving up costs when buying stocks.\n- Own it.\n- Sell it when you like. Factor in commissions and slippage again to have an idea of the real win/loss you had with the trade.\n- Possibly pay taxes on the surplus you made through trading - depends on your country.\n\nThis is a very, very rough guideline - like I said in my other comment, I liked \"The New Trading for a Living\" by Alexander Elder. He goes a lot into the details surrounding this basic mechanic of trading.\n\nFor a \"wider\" approach on the US market, there are several ETFs you could invest in - S&amp;P500, large cap/small cap ETFs, Dow Jones,\u2026 will most certainly create less stress and headaches over all in the long run - but that also depends on what you want to do: Have quick wins with day/swing trading (good luck) or slowly growing \"retirement\"/longterm funds (where you then should diversify into more than just US market stocks\u2026).\n\nGoogling any unknown term from this comment will for sure help you :)", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "HerrBertling", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1487079829, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t1_ddq1rfc", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488835398, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddqaw60", "link_id": "t3_5tvkte", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Know yourself.

I used it all through high school in algebra 2, geometry, trigonometry, and finally calculus. \nWatch videos on topics you need strengthening on, but most importantly, do practice problems. That's the best way to learn math. Do a problem and review why you got it right or wrong. \n\nAsk questions to the teacher. It's their job for you to understand the material. Do all the homework (don't just copy other people's or the answers from the back of the book). \n\nDiscuss homework problems with other people and don't be afraid to ask the kids who are good at math for help. \n\nTake the course seriously. If you stop caring about it just because you don't understand something, then you won't succeed. Trigonometry sounds complicated and intimidating (and looks like it), but remember that almost all math can be represented visually. For me at least, it's easier to learn with a visual in addition to the material, i.e. Graphs and diagrams. Khan Academy is especially good with this and the instructor always draws little graphs to show what's going on.\n\nI hope this helps. Good luck!\n\nEdit: as far as tests being harder than what's taught, I definitely relate to that. I would say the best thing to do it search the internet for the topic you're on and find videos/websites where they do problems.

My suggestion would be to watch TED talks related to climate change, listen to podcasts/videos of Bill Nye discussing it, and also looking into how it is presented from news sources. These mediums are geared towards a general audience, rather than a scientific journal or paper.\n\nAs for convincing them, there are a few things I can think of to help you with that:\n\n- confidence in your knowledge. Knowing the numbers and their sources shows that you know you're stuff and are serious about it. That doesn't mean knowing everything, but being able to recall important info quickly is good.\n\n- cause and effect. Some people claim things like \"the earth is SUPPOSED to be getting warmer,\" which is true, but you can counter with further info about how it's heating at a rate of over 10 times faster DUE TO the high concentration of greenhouse gases produced by humans, etc. Being able to show a direct cause and effect over time makes it hard to debate against it. \n\n- don't make them feel dumb. Just because they're wrong doesn't mean you have the right to antagonize them or act better than them. The goal of a debate is to provide clearer evidence for your point over theirs. Put things in words they'll understand with relevant statistics. Have a discussion and know your sources and ask for their sources if they make a claim that you don't believe/is wrong. \n\n-  understanding their perspective. Maybe they aren't as informed and think that because their city has reached a record low temperature that global warming can't possibly be real. Obviously that's wrong, but perhaps they misunderstand what climate change actually is and clarification on that will make things better. If you are receptive to them, they are more likely to be receptive to you. I know people can be stubborn and argue for the sake of arguing. So instead, make it a discussion. Hope this helps somehow!\n\nEdit: as for building your knowledge on the topic for people who aren't informed, read. There are hundreds if not thousands of papers and articles about it. If you don't have time for all that, find sources for graphs and learn to interpret those so you can show them to people. That's a good way to show evidence.

It's $20, and it takes 4 hours to read casually.\n\nNext, since you want the mathematical background, my go-to textbook is the Basic Practice of Statistics by Moore, Notz, and Flinger. After 'Cartoon', you could probably skip most of the first half (anything not related to probability) and dive into t-tests, contingency plots / chi-square tests, and ANOVA. This book has been around a long time, and I've personally seen older by perfectly acceptable (5th, 6th) editions at thrift stores for $5. \n\nHaving said that, nearly any intro stats book at a thrift store will serve your needs.

I say this because to come into the construction world without prior contracting experience, especially on a personal home is a huge risk. You will make mistakes, you will get burned, and when subcontractors hear that you're first timers they will take advantage of you, and your lack of experience will make it very difficult for you to know when/how they are doing it.\n\n One of the most important tasks in construction is finding quality subcontractors that perform good work. It's hard to know for sure what you're getting when you haven't previously worked with specific crews. On the front end it can be very difficult to distinguish good subs from bad subs, because you will be talking to intelligent, experienced people when taking bids for the work, but their workers could literally be 3 meth-heads who lied about being carpenters for 10 years and just got hired, and you wouldn't know until they show up and build your walls out of square. It really does take experience to be able to avoid 90% of issues that arise in construction. You could pay a GC 5-10% of the total cost and let him deal with all of the headaches, or you could try and manage it on your own, and most likely end up spending 10-15% or more on re-work and mistakes. \n\nDon't get me wrong, you are totally free to do as you want, and if you have the patience, dedication, and time to take on a project like this then I think you should go for it.

Music and essential oils can help but aren't necessary. Sometimes they can distract you, so choose wisely.\n3. This part is optional. What I do is imagine a place that is paradise to me (not necessarily a beachy place, wherever you feel the best, think of that.) Then you can imagine someone there, or many people. ex. anyone who you love, your friends, etc. I also practice loving kindness meditation, where you do step 1 and 2 and then envision someone you dislike or are angry with, but you want to be on better terms with. Think of this person being happy with you, or think of their best qualities/traits and what good things they have done. If you are having trouble thinking of something, just remind yourself that they are a person and deserve equal respect. You can also just repeat a phrase like \"loving kindness\".

The only way you can deliver that is by asking those questions and genuinely listening to the answer and applying it.\n\nSo, if someone walks in you need to find out *why* they came in. Let's say they mention they're looking for something for their wife's birthday. *What* did they have in mind? That narrows it down to either earrings, a bracelet, a necklace, or something else. *When* did they first meet/get married. This will help you understand the depth of their relationship. *Where* did they first meet or currently live can help jog some nice memories easing the customer a bit. \n\nAlong with these questions, I was also taught that often times you're looking for the third answer they give as the first two are generally coming through a cloud of privacy. \n\n*What did you have in mind?*\n\nSomething nice but not too expensive.\n\n*Anything item in particular that you were considering?*\n\nProbably a necklace.\n\n*Were you thinking gold or silver?*\n\nProbably like a white gold.\n\nBoom!

Communication: Being the smartest guy in the world doesn't mean anything if all of his ideas stay inside of his head. This is a two way game: both parties must be on the same page. \n\n2. Competency: Straight up, a leader must be able to do the things they are asking their team to do. If they themselves cannot do said task, they must be able to adequately coach someone else who *can*. Summarily, it helps to lead by example - but know that you personally don't have to be the example. \n\n3. Cool and calm under pressure: When the shit hits the fan, everyone will look at **you**, O Great Leader. The leader must remain calm and collected when things don't go according to plans - the rest of the team will feel and emulate whatever the head of the team does. \n\n4. Consistency: Being able to do something awesome one time is good. Doing it repeatedly with the same results is GREAT! \n\n5. Continuous Growth: Kaizen. Very Japanese concept. Basically, look around you. How can you make this better? How will you go about doing it? What materials do you need? Go do it. \n\nOkay, now record your results and do it again, to everything. And when you're done, do it all again. \n\nYou should always look to improve yourself and those around you. Your success as a leader is evident in the success of those around you.

Clothing that wicks away sweat and keeps skin unconstrained, or keeps it loosely covered to protect from the sun is much more important than any way of magically getting used to certain temperatures.

Here are some tricks I've figured out along the way, some of them might be kind of obvious but they weren't for me:\n\n- Always think about who your audience is and change your story, jokes, references, etc. accordingly. There's nothing worse than watching a speaker completely out of touch with his audience. This includes figuring out how much they know about the subject at hand.\n\n- Never speak louder to get people's attention, instead lower your voice.\n\n- If you're nervous: break the ice with your audience by picking two or three people and asking them for their opinion on random issues or making small talk.\n\n- Know the subject matter inside out, pay a lot of attention to the general structure of your story beforehand but be confident you can fill in the details on the spot.\n\n- Be comfortable with periods of silence. They simply feel longer when you're the center of attention but are great for letting the audience process what you've just said before you unload more information onto them. This way they don't have to choose between listening to you or following their own train of thought.\n\n- Show humility and be able to laugh about yourself. If you stutter, trip, sneeze or burp by accident: own up to it, don't ignore it.\n\n- Don't fill time for the sake of it. Only get in front of an audience if you actually have a story that they want to hear.\n\n- Finally: have fun!

For me the biggest thing was just getting forced to do it over and over again, until one day I watched a video of myself speaking and realized I wasn't so bad anymore. In college I worked in Admission and basically lived in fear of having to talk to more than 2 prospective students at once, at least until I took the communications course where I had to make the aforementioned video. Then I gained confidence and have subsequently loved public speaking. \n\nSo I think it comes down to 2 different fixes for 2 possible problems:\n\n1. If it's the communication factor itself, then learn how to communicate effectively in any medium you're comfortable with. If you can write in a succinct, engaging, and articulate manner, then you have the foundation for speaking in a similar manner.\n\n2. If it's nerves (which I still get from time to time), then just find ways to do it a lot, and accept that you'll suck until you don't. If you can find a way to do it in your job or school, then perfect, but if not there are plenty of other ways. Join a club or church group and volunteer to read the announcements. Get in the habit of researching a topic and speaking to friends on it (this can be surprisingly nerve-wracking, but good friends will be supportive and willing to help). \n\nParting thoughts: One of the best pieces of advice I've gotten is that a huge part of stage fright is the result of sensory overload, as we suddenly receive an enormous amount of information from all of the faces turned towards us. The people looking bored, or confused, or cute, or whatever. Regardless of what they're actually thinking, that's a huge amount of information to take in and attempt to parse while you're already nervous. So in the past I've made a point of preparing to speak by closing my eyes and imagining myself in front of a crowd. Seeing all of their faces and and letting myself experience that stomach dropping sensation of nervousness. Then I just sit there and take it in. Just let myself experience that fear. That has prepared me well for actual public speaking, because it gave me experience with that first moment before I begin. In that moment I now wait a beat or two and just take in the room before I start.\n\nFinally, no matter how good you get, sometimes you'll screw up. Something I had to internalize was that even in a good speech, I wouldn't speak perfectly. Sometimes I'd get distracted or nervous or trip over my words or forget to breathe or whatever. It happens when we speak normally, and it happens when we speak in front of people. Either way, just keep on talking and you'll get there.", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "james_is_an_ok_guy", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": 1487386666, "created_utc": 1487386468, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5un9xn", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488936686, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddw1p86", "link_id": "t3_5un9xn", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Haha I hear ya.

Booking consistent shows; 1-2 weekly rehearsals; great projects with lots of fun, creative, and challenging outlets; and I had a dedicated studio set up for a full band to plug in and play and practice at any time. So any time I had an idea or I was just pumped about something, I could sit down at my kit or strap on a guitar and hack through what I was thinking. That kind of dedicated work space is what makes \"whenever I fee like practicing\" work.\n\nMajor life changes later, I moved to northern Minnesota for a couple years where the talent pool was significantly reduced and I never got a project together. I just made another jump to Key West (with a baby now) where the scene is mainly cover bands. I've done cover bands before and it blows. I was so bored creatively that I learned to play drums backwards (left hand ride, right hand backbeat, left foot playing slave kick pedal). I'm slowly setting up a guitar/synth/effects work space, and I don't have room for drums which kills. [I just recently put out a CL ad](https://keys.craigslist.org/muc/5997231740.html) looking to start up a percussion project to play for tourists down at Mallory Square.\n\nWhile I was in Minnesota, I broke my left wrist snowboarding, and sprained the right wrist in the same stupid fall. It was a brutal recovery and had to take about 9 months off from drumming completely and start from square one. 8 on a hand at *pp* was incredibly painful.

Often people forget that sending a message well is fine and dandy, but if the recipient of that message doesn't appreciate the content, the message is useless regardless of how it was sent.\n\nThere are many good public speaking or inspirational speaking tutorials that start by asking 3 questions.\n\n\n1) What specifically is the topic? \n\nIf you don't know the topic, people often tend to become emotional and try to persuade the person that they know enough to be considered worthy of being listened to. This comes across as faster speaking patterns (try to shove in info before they stop listening), or loud/emotional speaking (why aren't you listening to me you bitch). The best senders of messages don't try to hold the audience attention because they know enough about the topic that they know what to leave out that's boring, and have thought about it for enough time that they can be concise. A rational and deep thinker will not be making off-the-cuff remarks about something they know little about, it's often the mark of an incredible public speaker to state you have no opinion, so when you do have an opinion people are more likely to want to listen to you and as such you get more confidence in yourself.\n\n2) Why is the topic is important to the audience?\n\nTrying to persuade someone to your point of view is first achieved by making the person have a reason to listen to you, attaching a value to your opinion is a good way to start. We have great examples of how to be annoying, creepy and long winded, but many speech writers are blessed by having messengers who are by their position worth listening to. Before you try to be a good public speaker, the most important thing you can know is how to frame an argument in an open-minded way so that the audience feels it's important to them to listen to you not just to respond but to understand. Understand the values of the person and understand that how you would frame a sentence to one person is different how you would frame one to another. \n\nIn real public speaking terms, this is called audience framing and matching. You want to match your statements to the values that the person will have, or the opposite of your statement to the opposite of the values of the audience. Politicians will wear jeans and a flannel when addressing farmers or coal miners because wearing a suit is what \"those city folks wear\" and by matching the audience, the audience will feel one of their own is giving it. There is a more important value attached to the sentiment if a member of the ingroup is giving it. This goes for everything you say, make it a game to frame every conversation from the point of \"why is this worth saying to the person, why should they care? Why is it important?\" If it's not important, don't have it and dilute your message sending resume.\n\nFinally we have \n\n3) Know your audience, what questions will they ask?\n\nBy now you should know that you only will try to influence people and publicly speak in topics you know in depth and you'll be framing the comment in a way that you realise is important to the person who is receiving it. The finale is being ready to answer questions from people who either disagree, are ignorant, or who would like to know more.\n\nThis is where every conversation is different and must be treated differently. You will win nothing by proving that someone is wrong, except damaging the relationship that you have with the audience and conducive networks are precious few in life. Knowing the topic in depth means knowing both sides of the argument and not just cherry picking facts that support your own. You'll know how to frame the argument so that it agrees with the person's own value statements and in a way that makes them feel you are not lecturing them but instead trying to show them what they wanted to know. A good speech will make them feel thankful for being a part of it.\n\nIn short, this is a shit speech because I know nothing about you so I can't give you any info worth a damn apart from 3 key principles and a direction to YouTube. But following those three key principles tends to make people more confident to begin with. The physicalises of how to breathe and how to stand, not to sway and not to drink coffee before, straight back, smile, eye movement and gestures, all of that is teachable by standing in front of a camera and watching yourself. Within a few hours you can see yourself match a confident speaker by being aware of what you are doing wrong and doing the opposite until it's habitual. None of that teaches you how to frame an argument that's worth listening to, and nothing is more demoralising than watching the attention drain out of an audience second by second as you are speaking with your back straight and good gestures and confident smile.\n\nThere's a few good books. Getting to yes is a fundamental negotiation book that is good for part 3. Piers Anthony has another good book that's name escapes me but works on a modified maslow's hierarchy to find quickly someone's values in quick succession so you can later frame arguments with more success. He's a friend of mine and well worth researching as the book is phenomenal for what you are asking for. Finally I'd definitely look at top 10 TED talks on mute, watch their behaviours and what they are doing as they are doing it well. All good public speakers display key traits. Find them and then practice them in the mirror. The content is ignorable, the behaviours are key.\n\nBest of luck!", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "pfft_sleep", "created_utc": 1487483669, "link_id": "t3_5utovv", "parent_id": "t3_5utovv", "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1488962322, "controversiality": 0, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "ddxhzr4"}, {"body": "If you actually have ADHD and are diagnosed, get a prescription for ADHD medication.

I've found practicing \"bookends\" in the car during the commute the opening and closing lines helps out a lot. Your intro, first key points, and the summary. If you start things and end things well, likely folks will have a positive impression.\n\n3. Mindset: it helps to remember you know more about your presentation and your topic than anyone in the audience.

All of these are helpful to have in the ADHD arsenal. I'm about to switch my fish oil to a high-DHA krill oil, since it's apparently more bioavailable than fish oil; I'll try to remember to report back with results haha\n\n2) Drink plenty of water! Dehydration is a major focus killer.\n\n3) Get some exercise! Every. Darn. Day. !. Dopamine regulation and use is an issue in ADHD brains, and exercise is a fantastic way to boost your body's production of it. Even just a 10 or 15 minute walk will help. Bonus points if it's out in nature: science has shown all of us benefit from better brain functioning after some time outside.\n\n4) Use a daily notebook to dump your tasks onto paper. I promise, it will have an easier time not forgetting than you will. Different people have different levels of success with varying organizational strategies, so do some searching on various methods and just try one! I rely on a simple spiral-bound notebook for my daily and write out a new list every day. Top line is always my morning routine items--right down to opening the blinds and brushing my teeth! It's granular, but it helps me find routine (VERY important for ADHD folks), and I get a motivational shot in the arm by crossing stuff off a list right away. Again, YMMV.\n\n5) Mindfulness meditation goes a really long way to retraining your focus. 10 minutes a day is all you need to get started, and the effects are scientifically proven. I've been reading The Mindfulness Meditation Prescription for Adult ADHD, and it's been quite helpful.\n\nI'm not sure of your exact situation, but it sounds like you may still be in high school. Your guidance counselor may be able to hook you up with some resources at school; once you get to college, your school will likely have a Students With Disabilities Services department, and they can help you get some ADHD-relevant assistance in your classes (quiet places to take tests, extensions on some assignments, etc).\n\nTake a look for some ADHD organizations in your area. CHADD has chapters all across the US, and their existence is purely to support people with ADHD (and their caretakers). They often have free meetings you can attend.\n\nFinally, do take a gander at /r/ADHD. They're a super supportive lot, and I've found it's often helpful to simply have a community I can relate with on these matters.\n\nBest of luck to you, friend!

Everyone has different \"tricks\" to stop a block, but I've found that raising your confidence is the best way to have better control over stuttering. \n\nProper nutrition and fitness are the two most important things to focus on. I've had more success with ketogenic eating than any other diet plan. Essentially it is a high fat, low carb diet. There are many positive side effects such as clear thinking, mental sharpness, rapid weight loss, insulin sensitivity, etc. The difference you feel when eating low carb, compared to before is unreal. It is like someone flipped a light switch. Once you start following this eating plan, you really have to be strict about it. Check out /r/keto to get started. It is an easy plan to follow, so stick to it. \n\n As for fitness, I enjoy running outside, weather permitting, and following a structured resistance training program which is easy to find online. Together they will make you look and feel better, in turn raising your confidence. \n\nAt the end of the day there isn't an easy fix to stop stuttering. You just have to find your own ways to make it easier. Speech therapy is the best solution, but if you're not insured it will get expensive very quickly. Not to mention, not everyone has success with it and it is something you will follow for quite sometime. Controlling your breathing, as well as staying away from excessive amounts of caffeine will go a long way. Lastly, make it a priority to go out and socialize. Isolating yourself will make stuttering worse.

As a language learner, the way I broaden my vocabulary in other languages is by actively learning a new set of words a day and writing them down a butt-load of times until they're ingrained in my brain.\n\nStep 3 would be to practice.  You won't gain a better professional speaking style overnight. Slowly bring in more advanced words and experiment with what type of words suit the style you are wanting to achieve.  Talk to yourself even, and create conversations with fake people.  Ask yourself business questions pertaining to your job and answer them in multiple different ways but keeping the answer the same.  Experiment and practice.\n\n\nExtra tip.  Keep a thesaurus/dictionary app handy and in free time, look up synonyms to words you dislike and wish sounded more professional.\n\n\nEdit: Wording (ironically) and Formatting", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "RyderFPS", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1487536609, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5v0979", "score": 10, "retrieved_on": 1488974846, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddy7ocq", "link_id": "t3_5v0979", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1487538120, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5uzc1x", "score": 0, "retrieved_on": 1488975478, "controversiality": 0, "id": "ddy8sli", "link_id": "t3_5uzc1x", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "I use to be so afraid of public speaking that I'd get so overwhelmed I'd pass out and sometimes cry. I took a public speaking class and that helped me tremendously(if available to you, take one), but the thing that helped me the most out of that class was being taught to take my nervous energy and turn it into positive energy. When you feel your blood pressure rising and your heart starts pounding take that energy and turn it into enthusiasm for whatever you're speaking about. Honestly it's like you're tricking your brain that all this anxiety you're feeling is actually excitement about the thing you're talking about. Your heart's not pounding because you're nervous to speak in front of people, it's pounding because you're excited to engage with them! \nBe well prepared for whatever you're doing or talking about, take slow, controlled, deep breaths, really focus on completely filling and emptying your lungs a few times. This usually allows you to steady your heart rate a bit and clear your mind,  then address that you're nervous and it's because it's perfectly normal to get anxious in these situations but you are well prepared and ready for the task at hand, then direct that energy your body has created out of anxiety to project your voice, engage with your audience, hold your head high, and speak confidently. Fake confidence becomes real confidence. \n\nThis has done wonders for me, I went from being a blotchy-faced, overwhelmed, can't get to the point kind of speaker and now I can present with such confidence and relative enthusiasm that I usually get compliments on getting people engaged in topics they would otherwise have found boring. \n\n", "edited": 1487559665, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "uhh_sara", "link_id": "t3_5uxubu", "created_utc": 1487538125, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": "t3_5uxubu", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488975480, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "ddy8squ"}, {"body": "Therapy/counselor my man.

These may or may not apply to you in your specific situation. My mom's health has greatly deteriorated over the last few years, so this is from my experience.\n\nEmotional things to be prepared for:\n\n* Parents may have a hard time understanding medical necessities. Be patient and take your time explaining things. They also might be embarrassed about medical issues or consider them very private and personal.\n* Parents may not appreciate their son suddenly in charge of their well-being. Make sure they know it comes from a place of love.\n* Understand that they are adults and want to live their life their way. Even if it isn't the way that makes sense to you. Things like diet and level of exercise are hard to change.\n* Be prepared to compromise. A doctor may say they need XY and Z. Your parents may only be willing to accept X and Y.\n* Expect them to be frustrated as they start to lose abilities such as driving, speaking, making their own food, etc. Losing independence is hard. Depression is also common.\n\nPractical things to do:\n\n* Make sure they get a will so that their wishes will be respected.\n* Look into a password manager for all their websites, bank accounts, facebook, email, etc. This obviously requires a lot of trust, so it may be worth a conversation if you become their caretaker. \n* Move closer to them.\n* Find out about their insurances, hospitals in network, doctors, etc.\n* Do you have siblings? Find out what level of care-taking each is willing/able to do.\n* Is their home accessible and safe? Will they need help going up and down stairs? Do they have tables and beds that are easy to get in and out of? Should the stove be disconnected since they might leave the gas on?\n* Ask yourself, should they still be driving? Be concerned for the safety of them and others on the road. (This is a particularly hard question.)\n\nLastly:\n\nCare-taking can be extremely taxing on you. It can impact you financially, emotionally, spiritually. Your time and energy can become focused on the well-being of other people.

I recently lost both my mother (2 years ago) and father (last December) to cancer and while there were similarities in their situations, the differences were far greater. My mother died relatively quick, less than 6 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. While my dad fought colon cancer for almost two and a half years before he passed.\n\nA couple of things to do before they get older and start to decline:\n\n\u2022 Get a living will and have a their affairs in order. Talk with them about their wishes in regards to life support. Have everything in writing.\n\n\u2022 Talk to a lawyer. Does your state/country have an estate tax? What is the threshold? Depending on the law, you can take steps now to protect your parent's wealth and ensure that their wishes are honored when they pass.\n\n\u2022 Get supplemental insurance. My parents both were on medicare, but on the advice of their accountant they had spoken with a consultant and purchased supplemental insurance that helped pay for their prescriptions and covered their medical bills when medicare fell short. It may cost a couple of hundred dollars a month, but it is worth it.\n\n\u2022 Don't wait to look into nursing care. As this generation has aged the demand for nursing care has risen. There is no guarantee you will be able to get into the facility of your choice no matter how much money you have. Plan ahead, visit the facilities and talk to the directors. Having a relationship with them will help things go smoother down the road. \n\n\u2022 If you or your parents are affiliated with a church or similar organization, get them involved. You cannot be with them 100% of the time and you cannot provide everything they need emotionally. A weekly visit from a pastor or senior citizen center means a lot. I cannot stress how much having visitors meant to my mom and dad.\n\n\u2022 Try to keep in mind that dying is no fun. (Obvious, I know) They will have bad days. They will be belligerent and moody. When my mom was dying I think her biggest fear was that it would be painful. For my dad it was that his body would betray him and he would \"embarrass\" himself. No one wants to be in a facility having to depend on relative strangers in order to eat, shower or go to the bathroom. Life can be cruel, try to understand their point of view and don't take any of the negative stuff personally.\n\n\u2022 If you have siblings/relatives willing to help, get organized and have a plan. Make sure someone goes with your parents to every doctor appointment. Take notes or record your conversations with the doctor. You cannot remember everything. Make a schedule, and know who is covering what.\n\n\u2022 Use only one pharmacy and get to know the pharmacists. If your parents fall ill, the burden is on you to coordinate their care. My dad had numerous issues over the last two years and at one point he had his regular doctor, an oncologist, radiologist and optician all treating him. Even today with all the computers and communication channels stuff gets missed or confused. A good pharmacist catches a lot of issues that may get by you or the attending physicians. \n\n\u2022 Talk to them about their funeral wishes. Contact the funeral home in advance if possible. A standard funeral will cost you over $10,000. Write their obituary in advance and check it for accuracy and spelling. The last thing you want to worry about when your parent dies is what the obituary should say and if the names are all spelled correctly.\n\nLastly, remember that you are there to help them get to the end, but there is a lot of work to be done afterwards. You will need several copies of the death certificate to tie up loose ends. Their social security will cease immediately, so there won't be any more money from the government forthcoming. If you haven't taken care of their house/apartment then you will need to make sure you can cover the cost of maintaining that until you settle those things. Emotionally, this will be a very tough time for you. When a person dies, you have to go over their estate and legally erase them from existence. It can be emotionally draining and frustrating. \n\nSorry this went on so long, but I hope it gives you some answers. I sincerely hope your parents are both well and you have several years with them ahead of you. Spend as much time with them as you can, once they are gone you will never get those opportunities back. Tell them you love them.\n", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "Waylander2772", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1487553417, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5uzcfx", "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1488981029, "id": "ddyjoos", "link_id": "t3_5uzcfx", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "Tell her thank you.

A good place to start is, of course, at the beginning, so taking a look at Genesis, the first book of the Bible, would be pretty helpful in seeing what people believe about the origin of the universe and how those beliefs still impact the political/ scientific climate today. It contains the creation of the universe, the first murder, Noah's Ark, God choosing the descendants of Joseph (whom God gave the name Israel, meaning \"he who wrestles with God\") to be his chosen people; again, more to be learned from that about today's politics, specifically in the Middle East.\n\nExodus, the second book, is an important one as well; details Moses' leading the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. Moses was born a Jew, but his parents sent him down the Nile river as a baby, where the Pharoah's family found him and raised him as an Egyptian prince (if you can't be bothered to read this one, I'd highly recommend the Disney movie adaptation *Prince of Egypt*, its great, Hans Zimmer did the soundtrack and everything, but I digress). He's the one who delivered the Ten Commandments to the Israelites and led them to the Promised Land. He's also very important in the context of Jesus, because the majority of Jesus' struggle with the religious leaders of his day stemmed from the fact that he came to establish a new law other than that of Moses, which was still the main law of Judaism even in Jesus' day, thousands of years after Moses' death.\n\nNow skipping a couple thousand years, as I'm just trying to hit the essentials, we come to the New Testament. The NT starts off with the Gospels, those are the books Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. They all detail the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and are the canonical story of Jesus' ministry. All four books tell the very same story, but they are each unique in what the authors, after whom they are named, chose to emphasize about Jesus. For instance, Luke emphasizes Jesus' heart for the poor, the sick, and the outcasts of society, while Mark emphasizes the power and divinity of Christ. If I had to recommend one of them, I'd say John's your best bet. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are all eyewitness accounts, as they travelled with Jesus throughout his ministry, but John wrote his gospel long after the fact and took more of a research-paper approach to writing the story, collecting information from many sources over many years, providing a more straightforward and unbiased story in my opinion.\n\nNext we have the book of Acts, picking up where John left off shortly after Jesus comes back from the dead (spoilers). After Jesus spends a few days on earth with his loved ones after the resurrection, he ascends back into Heaven, and then the story shifts onto a new disciple named Paul, who is sort of the very first Christian missionary. Acts details Paul's ministry, the early church, and the beliefs of the first followers of Christianity, or The Way, as it was called at the time. Some modern churches use Acts as a template of how a church and society should work (except for the fact that the Christians in Acts were all Communists), so it is also quite important for understanding Christianity.\n\nIt's getting late so I'll come back and add more in the morning, but for now I'll leave you with one of the most interesting, controversial, and overall scary books of the Bible - the final book, Revelation, or St John's Apocalypse, as it's sometimes called. It foretells the return of Jesus and his world-ending war against the Antichrist. Many Evangelicals today hold certain political beliefs hoping their politics will speed up Christ's return, such as their support of Israel, as there is a very powerful Israeli kingdom in the future according to Revelation. It's a pretty cool story, there's dragons and a valley full of blood and everything, definitely not a cute bedtime story for the kids.

It's more geared towards artwork than, say, Photoshop.  Way cheaper, too. Has a lot of nice convenience tools geared towards lineart, for example.  It was formerly known as Manga Studio 5.  I'm not sure if it still does the standard and EX versions, but if it does the EX version has more features (but also costs more). \n\nThere are good tutorials for it online, both Manga Studio 5 and Clip Studio Paint tutorials should work (though the MS5 tutorials might be slightly outdated in some ways).\n\nAs far as style goes, every artist has to discover their own preferred way to draw things.  Sometimes it's a natural evolution of how you learn your skills, sometimes it's a conscious design decision you choose to implement.  Don't be afraid to adapt things you see other artists doing.  See a nose style that really appeals to you?  Start using it.  Find a certain type of line-work appealing?  Start using it.  Borrowing from other artists is a time-honored tradition, and basically an essential part of the process these days.  Just don't straight up copy another artists style completely.  Though there are styles so generic it's easy to copy them completely on accident.\n\nBeware of the 'but it's my style!' pitfall.  It's common for artists to get defensive when their artwork is criticized, often times claiming the flaws are their 'style'.  There's a big difference between stylized art and just weird or poorly executed art.  If a lot of people are telling you they think the way you draw hands is weird, you may want to listen.  You may like it, but if nobody else does then nobody will like your art.  If it's just for you, awesome, but a harsh part of the reality of making your artwork public is that you won't get anywhere if your art isn't appealing to anybody.  Be humble, and willing to accept critique.  Even as someone highly experienced with artwork I still get critiqued, and it stings every time.  But often times the critique is legit, and being able to examine the flaws you couldn't originally see that someone else points out is a very valuable skill for an artist.\n\nAlso, be prepared to suck at first, especially if you have little to no experience drawing.  Nobody gets good overnight.  Some catch on quicker than others, but don't be discouraged if your progress is slow.  One fun way to test your progress is to have a picture you re-draw every year.  If there's a noticeable difference in quality, it'll really encourage you.  If there's barely any difference, it's an opportunity to re-evaluate your abilities, and plan out the things you can do to improve more.  Early on you might want to do it more frequently, like every three or six months.  But you get the biggest insight when you do it yearly (or at least I think so).\n\nAlso, another danger for every artist is getting too hung up on making a 'perfect' picture.  As you draw, you'll be aware of every single imperfection in your picture.  They'll stand out to you, and will drive you bonkers.  You may find yourself extremely frustrated and unable to finish.  At times like those, I find it best to leave the drawing for at least an hour before coming back.  You'll often find that it looks way better than you realized.  Try looking at your favorite artists' work really closely sometime.  You'll notice little flaws and mistakes if you really look for them, but they're actually not very noticeable unless you look for them.  That's just the reality of art.  Most people aren't going to notice the little things.\n\nAlso, I think you're getting downvoted for your post title.  I think people are either finding it offensive (calling anime stuff 'weeb shit' is very condescending, and joking/sarcasm can be hard to convey through text), or they know you're joking but find the flippancy of your tone annoying.  It's better to know your audience when choosing how to phrase something.

If you don't have a gym buddy with whom you can alternate sets just get yourself a kitchen timer and give yourself 2 minutes between sets.  \n\nEach muscle group needs up to 72 hours of rest between workouts, but some can be worked out together as they are complementary.\n\nI was always taught:\n\nDay 1 - Chest and Triceps\n\nDay 2 - rest\n\nDay 3 - Back and Biceps\n\nDay 4 - rest\n\nDay 5 - Shoulders and Forearms\n\nDay 6 - rest\n\nDay 7 - Legs\n\nRepeat\n\nIf you don't want to rest completely on Days 2, 4 and 6 (although it would be beneficial), do some light aerobics or gentle swimming. \n\nI know that the instinct is that the more you work out the faster the progress will be, so why have all those rest days.  But the thing is that when you work out (to the point of failure) your muscle fibres are damaged and a message is sent to your brain that they need to be repaired and strengthened so you can lift heavier weights in the future.  But your body can't do that overnight which is why you really need 72 hours of rest for each major muscle group.  \n\nIt may look like there is a lot more rest than 72 hours between each Chest and Triceps day for example, but the thing is that they have to help out a bit on other days like Back and Biceps even though they are not the primary focus.\n\nDiet is also really important.  You will need to ingest a lot of protein, but your body can only process so much of it at a time.  For me the easiest solution was to cook up a batch of hard boiled eggs every evening and take the egg whites to school/work the next day and snack on them every now and again.  The yolks are not the evil that they were once perceived to be so you can have those occasionally too, but it's probably not a good idea to have 12 egg yolks a day.

I did chorus/mens choirs and a lot of talent shows. And the average person considers me good, but to anyone who knows anything, I suck. That being said, here's my advice. \n\n1. I became a WAY better singer when I started commuting to school, and singing 40 mins there, and 40 minutes back, everyday. \n\n2. I became a better singer when I stopped being embarrassed of my own voice. If you are holding back when you're by yourself, you will NEVER, be good. When you're afraid, you sing in a way that is wrong, I don't know what it is exactly, but you dont use enough air, you tighten up certain parts, and you just sing wrong. Your vocal chords are muscles, and singing well takes COORDINATION with those muscles. You are like a child learning to write, and your handwriting is terrible. You need to keep testing your limits, and figuring out how your own voice works.\n\n3. Find a singer who sings around your voice range, you will likely still struggle on certain notes (when they go high normally), but you work on them, try to copy them, and you get better. I like micheal buble, josh groban, boyce avenue etc.\n\n4. Look up some exercises on youtube, some have helped me before with warming up and hitting notes easier.\n\n5. I'm constantly trying to push and control my range, when I used to struggle to hit high notes, i had to use a LOT of air, and because i was pushing so hard, it's harder to control and sounds ugly. But you have to literally, not give a shit because it's just you in your car, and keep on singing. Eventaully I didn't have to try so hard to hit those notes.\n\n6. This will all be much harder if you aren't good at hearing notes, because you need to be able to hear when you are wrong, or off key. And you want to be able to mimic people that you think are singing well, so that takes an ear, eventually you figure out how to pronounce certain words and how to sound good. Actually you should learn BASIC basic music theory so you know how notes work. For example when I'm in the car I sing ALL the time, every song I hear, even if it's a chick singing I just drop it an octave, and/or change the key (i dont care if it's perfect) and I change a few words so it doesn't sound gay. Even if it's trance/house music, I make up supporting parts to the song to improve my ability to harmonize/improvise.

This exercise teaches you to PUSH enough air hard enough to hit a note without having to worry about mouth placement and making a Vowel sound like AH, or OH.\n\n2. Another one involves the same notes, except this time you have your tongue all the way out, and you TRY to pronounce the sounds (its impossible) ta-na ta-na ta-na ta-na taaa, and la-ga la-ga la-ga la-ga laaa. And the point of is is that by STRUGGLING to pronounce these sounds with your tongue all the way out, like as if you were holding your tongue, it loosens up and warms up a part of your throat/mouth whatever that makes it a lot easier to hit higher notes and sound better.

But we do things like that because of lack of experience, and because we don't stop and think.\n\nOne way of thinking about this is that your 'system 1' is not being stopped by your 'system 2'. System 1 is your automatic system. When you do something automatically, habitually, or intuitively, that is your system 1. System 2 is that thing that makes you stop and think things through. System 2 is exhausting to use and people will default to system 1 more often than not. Let me give an example. You don't need to think through 1+1=2 because you've heard it so many times that it's intuitive. 93600*746000 will require some effort on your part, and it is tiring to do. When buying groceries your brain is trying to find short cuts and not go through the mental effort of actually solving the equation. It's trying to rely on some rule of thumb.\n\nBy saying you want to be more rational, you can do this one of two ways. By improving system 1 through experience. Or creating a habit of using system 2 more often. As I said before; experience or stopping and thinking. \n\nYou seem to want to do the \"stop and think\" approach. To do this I would recommend creating a habit of \"stopping and thinking\". This can be done every morning as you think of the decisions you will make in the day. Or, put a a piece of paper in your wallet that says \"System 2!\" so that before you make a purchase, you stop and think things through. The key is to just stop and think. It requires mental effort and is uncomfortable, but it should cure some of the 'disrationalia' you are experiencing.\n\nAnother way is continuing education. Doing things that make you think in one area of life will bleed over to other areas of your life. For example, lesswrong is a a site about how to be more rational. By reading the stuff there, you'll probably develop a habit of defaulting to system 2 more often. Think of it like a muscle. \n\nOut of curiosity.

Another good thing was to ask myself when starting something stupid addictive, what gain I will have (fun does count but only if all my most important priorities are done)...if I do not see much gain, I won't even start and try to be addictive with something that helps me more.\nHope I could help..", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "MoeAmante", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1487800784, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5vk05p", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1489061291, "controversiality": 0, "id": "de32104", "link_id": "t3_5vk05p", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Man I'm going through something similar so I know what's it's like to have sat on the sidelines for so long you forgot how to play the game.\n\nThe first thing you gotta do is fix yourself. No one else can fix you and your problems only you can. Reframe negative beliefs about yourself into things you can improve upon. Write in a journal every day. ( I have a great template if you are so inclined.) Writing from the heart without being judged is a great way to get used to streaming your consciousness uninhibited.\n\nAccept what you can't change, improve what you can. Don't like your face? Honestly that's too bad but not liking it only makes it worse. Learn to love your imperfections and make them your strengths, you will love yourself for it and so will others.\n\nPractice talking to people! The only way you get better is by trying and figuring out what works. Look at how insignificant the \"con\" of rejection is to the potential benefit. Anxiety is a bitch but only by doing what you fear , is how you will over come it. I personally like talking to people on video game chats because it's so meaningless and temporary and I don't give a shit if they don't like me.\n\nDon't be so hard on yourself man, you deserve love and self love just as much as any other human being. All you really gotta do is CONSISTENTLY attempt to improve yourself and your situation, and I promise things will get better. Negativity is easy to spiral into.

OOO~\n\n\nWhen you're comfortable with that, say BOY again and this time hold the very end. BO-Y. You should end up making an 'eeee' sound, with your cheeks nice and wide.\n\n\nPractice making the sounds without moving your tongue, and when you're comfortable producing them in isolation start combining them with words.

While it is true that some important matters demand that you ensure the right thing is said, in which case pausing is most likely acceptable in those cases, most other matters we speak about can be left to our own improvisational skills. They can be trained just as the ability to proof read your sentences can be trained. Now I don't know your situation, I am just assuming, but often times the remedy for stuttering or pauses is to not second guess yourself and to instead trust the first thing that comes to mind, which I admit is far more difficult to do than finding a replacement for your cigarettes. But that's just my opinion, maybe I'm wrong and you find yourself strongest when thinking before saying and this really is just an issue you can't resolve.

Like I get that people are mainly vaping because they like it and they're not going at it from the \"stop smoking\" angle, but in my case it helped me do just that. I even stopped vaping last July (stopped smoking when I started vaping in December 2015) entirely and haven't smoked or vaped since then, *or had any desire to do so*. Well, now anyways, it was definitely a challenge learning what to do with myself now that I'm not holding a vape and passing the time vaping constantly like I would at parties or at home etc. But weirdly I found it *way* easier to do that than when I stopped smoking in the past. Mind you it also helps that cigarettes and tobacco are so goddamn expensive now (in Australia) that it's really the sensible option. Over the last 10 years or so the price has easily **doubled**. I could buy a pouch of tobacco with papers and filters for about 30 AUD or so back then (~23 USD), now it's like 50 or 60. And that's for good tobacco too. \n\nI'd say in my case vaping helped me retrain my habit to focus on something different than a cigarette, while doing fundamentally the same thing that a cigarette would do (some thing you put in your mouth to suck flavour air from and pass the time basically). That I found never worked for me if I replace the cigarette with some other activity, because my brain knows I'm trying to trick myself, it wants an honest to god cigarette then. It also deconditioned me from accepting cigarette smoke as a natural part of the world, if that makes sense. Like now cigarette smoke would strike me as genuinely foreign and undesirable, at least more so than when I was smoking.\n\nIn the case of vaping you just have to be careful with the nicotine intake. As in it's relatively easy to dose it low but it's super easy to do too much of it because you don't notice it as much. Like it's not as harsh as cigarette smoke where if you smoke a lot in a day it feels like it. Incidentally I stopped because I felt it was going out of control a bit too much and I was having too much nicotine. The interesting part is that it severed the \"I guess I'll smoke again\" thought avenue completely, somehow. I also stopped smoking weed a few months before smoking tobacco which could have influenced that as well, because \"I'll need some tobacco to spin for a joint\" was the reasoning to have tobacco at home at all, which I would then smoke, then run out and buy new etc.\n\nThat's after smoking since about 2001 to varying degrees, like at some points like one cigarette a day or so, then progressively more constant. Never tried the patches or nicotine gum because I heard horrible things about them and didn't want to go that route at all. I have also quit smoking for a year or so here and there in the past so it's not that unprecedented for me but I hope to just kick it for good this time. It really helps that the part of my brain that says \"wew sure would be rad to have a smoke right now\" just isn't firing that anymore, like ever.\n\n\n**TL;DR** - a lot of factors and it's all my personal experience so not saying it will definitely work or not with other people. My rationale is that with vaping as far as quitting goes it's effective because the mental steps are less jarring and forced. As in you replace smoking with a less harmful alternative for the same thing, filling your lungs with tasty vapour and nicotine (you do definitely feel it if there is no nicotine though, it's not nearly as satisfying).

I am a previous smoker. You are lying to yourself if you think your body doesn't want nicotine. It is a hard desire to recognize because it starts to consumes your thoughts and makes quitting hard.\nEven if you go days or weeks. Your brain still wants it.\n\nThe bad part is, it really sucks for more than your lungs. In fact, that is what will likely be damaged last. It is terrible for your mind, damages your vocal chords, wrecks hormone regulation in some people, is pretty much Garunteed to give you cardiovascular issues. Some damage is permanent and some is not.\nThere was once a study correlating kids with ADHD to parents that exposed them to regular cigarette fumes and smells. I think it came out of Europe. Forget where and I can't seem to find it. But it was a correlation to the effect second hand smoke had on people.\n\nRegardless cigs are bad for you and everyone around you. Your life will be better, and longer the sooner you can stop.\n\nSmokes also creates an imbalance in your brain chemistry filling serotonin receptors with empty useless nicotine. \nNicotine is only a stimulant if you have excess melatonin. That stimulant effect dies very quickly and is replaced by some strange self medicating habit that we all love to make excuses for. I think I haveade my point, moving on...\n\nQuitting is difficult. My wife stopped me, super appreciative of her for that.\n\nSo, how to quit. Well, it isn't easy and it varies person to person.\n\nI used to smoke as a form of escapism. It wasn't the only reason, but it was one of a few.\nThe point I am trying to make, it is hard to stop smoking because you are quitting more than just cigarettes. Perhaps that is how you spend your work breaks, or how you socialize. Maybe that is the only alone time you get. Do you spend more than a couple minutes outside not smoking? Do you smoke while driving.\n\nThink about all the things you are \"stopping doing\". It is more the just cigarettes.\n\n\nMy suggestion is first kick the tar. Buy a decent vape. And slowly but surely cut back on nicotine comfortably.  As low as you can without going back to cigs. Try to avoid cigs all together if you can. \n\nWhile doing this. Start trying to rethink the things you did while you smoked. Then try to mitigate the habit with some external filler. A bottle of water could help replace the oral fixation but focus on the other issues not that. Oral fixation is just a reword of nicotine addiction. Try singing in the car or doing Sudoku during work breaks. \nQuitting with someone else doesn't work. Make this about you.\n\nMeditation or medicine, both can help cure addictive personality disorders. (Different anxieties or ADHD can add to addiction disorder I am no expert though and I would suggest consulting one.)\n\nNext, speaking. You can go crazy with comfort here. Believe it or not, writing can be very helpful to speak better. Practice writing summaries of articles or ideas you find interesting. Try to add 3 words to your arsenal every day.\nThat will get you there. \n\nI can tell you though. Your pauses are likely glitches caused by an upset brain chemistry. That can be fixed with medication, but you need to get well away from the nicotine first. They don't work the same for people who smoke.\n\nYou are introspective enough to seek help. That is a sign of intelligence, I am happy that you are smart! But nicotine is powerful. It basically defines your life. Stop letting it. If you need support I would be happy to prolong your life for free through chats. \nNo shame, I know quitting is hard. But you will get so much of your time back!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "TheTalkWalk", "created_utc": 1487909523, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5vs43l", "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1489098450, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5vs43l", "id": "de56ze7"}, {"body": "Being on time is fairly important in life.

There was an ask Reddit a little while ago to that referenced this, something along the lines of \"what's something you notice your socially awkward friends doing\" or something, and the top response was \"not know how or when it's appropriate to end a conversation\"\n\nMost people don't like small talk, so if you engage it, you better know how your getting out it. Short contact makes for long friends, so get in and get out, but do it often. You're not going to win everyone over in one marathon conversation. If they're giving short answers especially, shut it down and just say hey nice chatting! Conversely, if they're responding a ton, then go with it, you probably have common interests to explore.\n\nTl:dr your question answers itself imo, if you're struggling to get more out of small talk, you've already lingered too long. Look more into social cues instead of trying to hit some time goal\n\nHope that helps!

Now I'm a big ol' boss.    \n\nAs someone who hires people for a living, here is what I typically look for:\n\n**What's your availability?**  If you're a high school student that means you can't work during the day M-F, so I'm going to have to have a need for weekend help ONLY. Maybe summer.  Look for places that hire for weekends (restaurants have lots of turnover, ask to be a busboy or a dishwasher.  Ask to bag groceries or stock shelves on weekends, etc.)\n\nGo back and ask every every week.  Swallow your pride.  Be that friendly kid who shows up again and again.  Get to know the names of the people working the cash register.  Buy them a cup of coffee if you have to and ask, 'hi Sam, is Mrs. Sally in today?  I need to ask if she's hiring today!'  Show up again two days later.  Rotate where you bug, grocery on Monday, dime store Tuesdays, etc.  If you're a nobody on paper, be someone in real life.  \n\n**Will you fit in with our culture?** We work with gay homeless kids, so a WWJD bracelet is actually a turn-off for me, I will make assumptions about your assumptions. ;)  During the interview, absolutely dress up.  I don't care if your tie has a stain on it, as long as it's a tie.  Show me you care about this job.  \n\n**Can I afford you?** You're asking for minimum wage, I'm looking at my budget both time AND money.  It's not just the financial cost, it's the time to train you, the hiring paperwork, the risk that you'll quit after a week because it's your first job and it sucks, blah blah blah.  If you don't have any volunteer experience (even babysitting!  lawn-mowing!  rebuilding a website for grandma!)  I absolutely will not hire you.  I need to know you can respond to an authority figure, respect my time, and believe in something bigger than yourself.  \n\nGo to https://www.volunteermatch.org/ and find a few things to start filling in that resume.  No excuses, get something on the calendar this weekend.  \n\nSome other tips: when asked why you want the job: NO SOB STORIES.  You want a job not a pity party.  Say that you love this *fill-in-the-blank-company* because *reason 1, 2, 3* and you're a good fit because *insert volunteer experience here, life goals, you're flexible! etc*  When you do get your first job, work hard at it.  \n\nThe high-schoolers I hire today are ONLY because the ones I hired a few years ago paved the way for you.  They convinced me to take a chance on them and worked their asses off and made me proud.  Be that person for someone who will come after you.  \n\nOk, I hope that helps.  Have fun volunteering this weekend and PM if you have more questions.  \n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author": "blat_woman", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1487975214, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": "t3_5w09my", "link_id": "t3_5w09my", "score": 20, "retrieved_on": 1489118553, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "de6cqxj", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "Damn you're blunt.

Physics is a notoriously difficult subject for students to learn. It's okay to look at solutions, that will enable a deeper understanding of the problem! \n\nThere is a unanimous consensus among my physics professors that the subject can be unforgiving to teach to undergraduates due to a multitude of reasons.In a recent interview with physicist David J. Griffiths about the teaching of quantum mechanics to undergraduates, Griffiths remarked, \u201cThe most difficult thing for the teacher to provide, and the student to develop, is a coherent framework for thinking about the subject\u201d. Due to the subject\u2019s difficulty, physics has become a subject taken merely because of the school\u2019s curriculum mandate. In a study conducted by the Staff of Research and Educational Association (REA), students\u2019 difficulty in understanding physics correspond to the following reasons:\n\n1. There are no systematic guidelines available for students when confronted with an unusual problem.\n2. Many textbooks written by a physicist or mathematician use abstract, theoretical wording (out of touch from the student) as the main explanation of a principle.\n3. Homework exercises are immensely time consuming, often because students resort to trial-and-error methods to understand the application of the vague principle in the textbook.\n\nIn order to cope with these downfalls in the classroom, students rely on their own research (or hastily use of search engines) to cross-reference material in their classes. HyperPhysics, an open source educational website run by Georgia State University Physics Department, outlines the uses for pillaring equations in physics. The YouTube channel SixtySymbols features a group of physicists explaining the conceptual background of many principles in physics. Textbooks written by David J. Griffiths like \u201cIntroduction to Quantum Mechanics,\u201d include a brief introduction to relevant history followed by detailed derivations.\n\nEach of the open source reference materials previously described contain essential information for understanding physics. Yet, this information is scattered in the form of mathematical handbooks, websites, YouTube videos, historical texts, and specific literatures outside of the course textbook.

Floss once a day, at night after you've finished eating for the day (I like to do it before brushing). Mouth wash is unnecessary and more for comfort of fresh breath. There are medicated ones but unless you really need them I wouldn't waste your money!\n\nYou can only whiten teeth with products that contain hydrogen or carbamide peroxide. The ONLY toothpaste I know of in Australia that contains one of these ingredients is Colgate optic white - it contains hydrogen peroxide and I've used it myself and it does work. In America you have plenty of brands that do whitening strips and what not - just check the ingredients for one of the above mentioned. \n\nYou can also go to the dentist and get whitening trays made up - it should only cost $100~ and you can keep them forever if you don't lose them. Just buy the gel (I recommend online it's so much cheaper) fill the trays and put them in for however long the instructions say. \n\nTeeth can also get stained superficially from plaque and calculus buildup - these generally have to be cleaned professionally. Removal of these stains can \"whiten\" the teeth but the base colour will be the same. \n\nA tongue brush can also drastically help with bad breath!", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "chamelon", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": 1488075838, "created_utc": 1488075649, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5w55d4", "score": 66, "retrieved_on": 1489146456, "controversiality": 0, "id": "de7ys72", "link_id": "t3_5w55d4", "distinguished": null}, {"body": "Your edit cracked me up.

I can get sucked into things easily and time will fly by so if you are not able to pay attention to the clock then setting temporary alarms help (I do it all the time and I give myself 5 minutes grace period from say my leaving time if I have to leave at 12 I will set my alarm for 11:55 so I have time to finish my activity or time to go back something I forgot). \n\nAlso if you have a tendency to forget things I find tapping my pockets helps and going through what I put in my pockets and throwing my things I need in the same exact place everyday when I get home from work first thing I try to do is empty all my pockets on my desk and pat them after.

While they often had big budgets to work with, it was the concepts that sold the songs.  \n\nBuild up a showreel and start looking for an experienced mentor.  \n\nForget about being paid for your efforts for quite a long time.  What you are aiming for is an opportunity to \"shadow\" a director on a professional music video shoot - if you do get that chance, be as unobtrusive and as helpful as possible, keep your mouth shut unless spoken to, and absorb as much of the process as you can.\n\nIf you get on OK with the director and producer you might be allowed to come back to shadow again, and eventually be given more responsibility, maybe even some low paid temp work.  But it's a tall ladder to climb and there are several thousand other people wanting to climb it with you so you have to be as diligent as possible and on your best behaviour all the time.  \n\nPersonally I don't get the impression that going to film school would be of any use to you.  Only 5% of people who go to film school end up working in any sort of visual entertainment industry.  I think it would be better for you to take the \"learn on the job and work your way up\" route.  \n\nFilm grammar in 2017 is pretty much \"anything goes\" so I don't think it's worth learning CHP (Classic Hollywood Production) style any more.  But it *is* worth knowing basic terminology for shot sizes, angles, camera moves etc. (to communicate better with your DoP and operator(s)), but that's something any of the operators on any of the music videos you are involved with can tell you for the price of a beer.  \n\nGood luck with your endeavours.

Just search \"buddhist centers (your town)\" and lots will start to pop up. Even answers on /r/buddhism are not the same as actually going and doing it. Experience makes a world of difference. \n\nI would highly recommend you go and sit in on meditations for a few different groups before you make any big decisions. You need to know who the people are and how they operate before you commit yourself to something like staying at a monastery. \n\nThe different flavors of Buddhism will make a difference in what kind of practice you'll have. To be in a monastery you'll be waking up around 4:30 every morning and going to bed around 9:00. You'll experience little privacy or free time, though those are there in small quantities. Often, your body will be sore from the sitting and various tasks, but you should develop a much deeper sense of understanding, insight, and clarity. You also don't need a monastery to develop those things, but it is right for some. \n\nAs you try out different communities with different instructors you might want to work with your intuition to determine if the place is right for you. If you feel comfortable in one more than you do another, something just feels right, etc. You will have to go through quite a few of them before you know what you are feeling and what it means. \n\nI went through a number of communities in my area before I found one that sat well with me. Even still, it isn't perfect and something inside of me says that Buddhism, even Zen which I so much admire, isn't quite for me. I'm looking for a different kind of teacher now. But I wouldn't have known that without putting myself out there and seeing if the communities were right for me. \n\nIf you're in a bigish city you should be fine and see plenty of opportunities. A smaller town is going to be more difficult, but possible. \n\nGood luck.

With only that much body fat you have plenty of room to bulk up without gaining fat, but you will need a lot of protein, and your body can only process a small amount at a time.   \n\nI think you should consult any of the staff at the gym you go to because they will be much more knowledgeable than me, but my suggestion would be to switch to a bulking routine (lower reps, higher weights, sufficient rest between working out each major muscle group).  Also, most gyms have an in house nutritionist who will also be able to advise.  \n\nRegarding diet, this may sound really boring, but one of the best forms of protein you can find is egg whites.  Cook up a batch of 12 hard boiled eggs every night, discard the yolks and take the whites to school and snack on them whenever you feel hungry (leave the yolks out on the balcony because other birds will love them).  You don't have to be completely hysterical about no yolks if you like them yourself, because they contain great nutrition themselves, but 12 yolks a day is probably not such a good idea.  \n\nThere are thousands of videos on youtube about diet planning for bulking so just surf around a bit until you find something that appeals to you.

These words by themselves don't really have any feeling in them. Some animals are gay, some aren't. Okay.\n\nBut if you think about it... do swans ostracize their homosexual peers the way humans do? Are there gay swans who got left out because their love mated with another swan for life? Do they then wander along by themselves, not having the understanding why they are the way they are, not being able to fulfill their nesting urges, until they die along by themselves in the corner of a lake no one visits? The more tragedy and sadness you place on the situation, the more you'll be likely moved.\n\nSo getting back to your situation. Think about all the situations that you get into in an argument and understand why the argument is happening, and how to fix it in the future, rather than taking it as a personal affair. Examples:\n\n* she said i don't care about her. (After all the things I've done, she still thinks that? Does she really think my efforts are so insignificant that they're not worth mentioning? Is she blind?) Vs. (What is there i can do that i haven't done lately to show I appreciate her? What was her reaction when i did something last? Was i too subtle? When was the last time i had a positive reaction and how can i replicate it?)\n\n* she said i never told her. She never told me is more like it! (I told her two weeks ago, one week ago, three days ago, yesterday, this morning, text this afternoon... How many times do i have to repeat myself?) Vs. (What sort of system can we establish to ensure that communication isn't broken up next time.)\n\nI'm not saying it's easy to control or shift your thoughts. That'd be like telling a depressed person to \"cheer up\". It doesn't work that way. But for me at least, if i have a logical path to lead me to another direction, away from one where i know i would be hurt and crying, then in the moment of the argument, i would rather try that path.

You can take your theory any time and I'd recommend doing it first. I took a two week intensive lesson structure so had to have my theory passed before I started lessons. I wrote a long post to somebody before about learning to drive so I'll repost and maybe you'll take something from it... \n\nMate, England here. Been driving 9 years or so. Manual the whole time. \n\nWhen I started learning I was sure I was gonna be a natural or whatever. Didn't happen like that. I really struggled at first. It was nearly a decade ago now but I remember my whole learning period vividly. \n\nThe most important thing you can do is be comfortable actually driving the car. Right now that's all you're thinking about but when you're learning don't forget you gotta be thinking about all the other shit. Rules of the road, signs, mirrors, everyone around you. If you can be comfortable getting the car going, getting through the gears without thinking, that frees you up a bit to concentrate on everything else. You won't get that comfortable until after you've passed but the more comfortable you can get, the better. \n\nBecause you're a real man and learning manual, gears will be your enemy at first. Learn what is actually happening when you engage and disengage the clutch, what exactly a biting point is. This is important. Knowing you'll stall etc when you fuck it up is one thing, knowing why it stalled is another.\n\nI assume you're learning in a car you'll only have access to for your lessons. Each car is different. Different biting points etc. Either way, spend as much time as possible out with your dad. Car parks, industrial estates, things like that. Just get comfortable driving a car. I cannot emphasize this enough. For example, one day on a lesson you're gonna be introduced to roundabouts. You want to be able to concentrate on the process of approaching one, signaling, what everybody else is doing, which lane etc. Trying to do this while not being comfortable in the car and worrying about that just adds to the complexity. Trust me. \n\nI can't be too detailed as I haven't driven to test standard for years. Nobody does once they've long passed. However I am a good driver. Never had any kind of accident and I've been on the roads a long time now, so some other tips I'd give you as a complete noob are.. \n\nUnderstand revs and pulling away. When you put your foot on the gas you're spinning the flywheel. Think of it as a round disk that represents power. The harder you put your foot down the faster it spins. You want to be pulling away at about 1500 revs at test standard. So say you're sitting at some lights. You'll be sitting there, handbrake up, clutch foot down. The gear stick will be in first gear but as you have the clutch disengaged you're essentially in neutral. As the lights change you perform a few things almost at once that will eventually become natural: you put your foot on the gas slightly, around 1500 on the Rev counter, like I said. As you're doing this, your left foot comes up off the clutch. Think of the clutch as another round disk with a grippy surface. As you bring the clutch up it meets the flywheel. This is the biting point, the clutch biting onto the flywheel. Bring it up too fast and you'll stall. Do it fairly slowly, maintaining the Rev level with your right foot, you'll feel the car start to give and the revs go quieter as the disks start to meet. You then release the handbrake and you're off. \n\nGive it gas, bring up the clutch, release handbrake as they meet, you pull away. Practice this as much as you can and you'll stall less. \n\nI'm really rambling here, sorry, but I hated every second of learning to drive. I wish I'd had a better grasp of it rather than struggling at first because I love driving now. \n\nGood luck, don't be intimidated, but respect the fact you're driving a fucking weapon basically. Learn how it works, why it behaves the way it does, then you can focus on the complicated shit. And don't worry about those impatient twats behind you. \n\nAny questions, feel free to ask by the way. Even if it seems stupid. \n\n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "rcktsktz", "created_utc": 1488308324, "link_id": "t3_5wnecm", "parent_id": "t3_5wnecm", "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1489216143, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "id": "debzjxj"}, {"body": "Try to translate your skills into some thing else.

I'd say start with a 10 minute break every hour (so 50 minutes of studying and 10 minutes of break per hour).\nI highly recommend getting up and doing something active during your breaks or, if you're feeling extra motivated you can even use your breaks to clean!\n\n2) When you are studying, minimize distractions.\n\nThis one almost goes without saying, but turn off you phone (or at the very least put it in silent  mode). You're going to take another break in 50 minutes at the most, you can check your phone then. \nI find that even hearing my phone vibrate totally destroys my concentration. Whatever it is that you are studying should be the only thing occupying your attention.\n\n3) Mix it up.\n\nIf you have more than one subject/ book/ article to study, try to alternate between them rather than spending hours on one subject, then hours on another. For example, if I had two books that I had to read,  instead of reading the whole of book 1 then the whole of book 2, I might try to alternate between reading a chapter of book 1 and reading a chapter of book 2. The basic idea is that you shouldn't bore yourself by spending too much time on any one thing, and by mixing up what you're doing, you will be more attentive because the subject is always fresh.\n\n4) Comfort is key.\n\nStudying can suck enough on its own without the added delights of hard desks and uncomfortable chairs.

For every hour and a half I spend working, I also spend about 45 minutes to an hour taking breaks.

I found that it helped to do the mock teaching aloud in an empty room and to repeat it until I had the information internalized. \n\n\n.\n\n\nOutside of outlining, there are other effective ways of organizing information to make it more manageable.

It also works best for mentally intensive exercises, like writing or programming, and less for attention intensive exercises, like research and memorizing.\n", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author": "FUCKING_HATE_REDDIT", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1488321949, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t1_dec2w0k", "distinguished": null, "score": 12, "retrieved_on": 1489221945, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5wpos9", "id": "decbm76", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "[Please watch this video](https://youtu.be/p60rN9JEapg)", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "GreyFox422", "created_utc": 1488323079, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_5wpos9", "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1489222377, "link_id": "t3_5wpos9", "id": "deccimq"}, {"body": "drugs", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "author": "zsajak", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1488323470, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t3_5wpos9", "distinguished": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1489222524, "id": "decctm1", "link_id": "t3_5wpos9", "controversiality": 0}, {"body": "Utterly useless platitudes.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "author": "Are__You__Happy", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1488323910, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "parent_id": "t1_dec9dtr", "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1489222693, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5wo3nz", "id": "decd61d", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "I find that when I do this I'm extremely tired.
