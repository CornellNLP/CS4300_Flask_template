And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it. I dug in, I did the work and then Bernie’s team trashed me for it. We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work and actually get it done.

Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.

The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again. Well, let me just finish because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump. I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks.

I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should.

So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it. And to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity, because if we don’t pass Representative Clyburn’s bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we’re never going to get to that single garment of destiny. And we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands- … of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off.

In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point. In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn’t work, but he tried hard. I don’t care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will.

Medicare for All will lower healthcare costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died. What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee healthcare to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer. Our plan, we have laid out options all over the place. One of the options is a seven-and-a-half-percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. Another tax-",

The Medicare for All plan alone, page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. That is true.

According to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the US Senate on 15 metrics. Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters. It matters if you can actually get things done. It is not just who talks to the best, who actually gets things done.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting, and I have found a way to pay for this, and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing.

So the answer is, one size doesn’t fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called Critical Access Hospitals, so they’re designated for rural areas. And actually, I am the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms, in rural areas be covered. The other issue is we don’t have enough personnel. And so, that’s where we get to this education plan. And I don’t agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy. We’re going to have a million openings for home healthcare workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don’t know how to fill. We’re going to have over 100,000 openings for nursing assistants. We’re not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees, we’re going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses. So putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one and two year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas. Final thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that.",

See, all of these things are connected. Housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter roles, to the closing of voting locations.

I’m going to give the CDC’s website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their healthcare provider, because many doctors are saying it’s just a matter of time before we’re going to start seeing this here. And I think the answers… As president, what would I do? I would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one.

Turkey, Russia, Iran, all have so much more of a say than we do. We don’t have to be invading countries to be making a difference working with our international partners in order to deliver peace, and support those who are standing up for self-determination. Now I want to come back to something, and I promise it relates to international affairs, because Senator Sanders asked me a question earlier. He asked the question of whether healthcare for everybody is a radical idea. And it’s not, which is why I’m for it, very much in a different way though. What is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance. And part of how you know it is, is that no industrialized country has gone that far. He and I both like to talk about Denmark for example, but even in Denmark, they have not abolished the possibility of private insurance. So this is an idea that goes further than what is acceptable in Denmark, the country, let alone imagining how that’s going to fly in Denmark, South Carolina.",
