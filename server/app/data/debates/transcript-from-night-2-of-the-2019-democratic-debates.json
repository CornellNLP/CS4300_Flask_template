And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today, we think it is time for change, real change. And by that I mean that healthcare, in my view, is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for All, single payer system. Under that system, by the way, vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now. I believe that education is the future for this country, and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt, and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.

It’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything’s going to be okay.” Too many people who are in the middle class and poor, have had the bottom fall out under this proposal. What I’m saying is that we’ve got to be straight forward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we are in a situation where there’s continuing education and they’re able to pay for it, and they have to make sure that they’re able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink. Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation, we do have enormous income inequality.

I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1%, and the biggest corporations in this country, contributing at least $1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle class families will pay for one way or another. Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly, this economy is not working for working people. For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most, and not in favor of the people who work the most, which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code. So for every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support, or not.

If you want to get universal healthcare coverage, I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can’t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don’t want to give it up. In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together. We got near universal healthcare coverage. We were the first state in America to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address, methane emissions, and we were also the first place to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis and we reduced teen pregnancy by 54%.

If you’re talking about ending gun violence, it’s the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress possible. It’s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies, when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege.

Where I disagree is on his solution on Medicare for All. You know, I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do, it is a right. Healthcare is a right. We need to get to universal healthcare. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option, that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare for All, or whether they want to keep their private insurance. I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that. [crosstalk 00:09:19]. Bernie … If I could just finish.

It’s logical to me that if you can refinance your house, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier. I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize, even the children of billionaires. I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition, and while I want tuition cost to go down, I don’t think we can buy down every last penny for them. Now, there’s something else that doesn’t get talked about in the college affordability debate. Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college. It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college. You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your church and little league, whether you went to college or not.

We would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods, creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier. We’d save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare. And just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion.

It’s why Donald Trump is our President today, that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

That’s why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen, no interest payment until they get beyond that. We can’t put people in a position where they aren’t able to go on and move on.

In 2005, when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All, and I won that two to one republican district. Twice. The way I formulated it was simple. Anyone who doesn’t have access to insurance they like, they could buy in at a percentage of income they could afford. That’s what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All plan. I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right and not a privilege to single pair. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers if they want to compete. They can certainly try. But they’ve never put people over their profits, and I doubt they ever will. What will happen is people will choose Medicare, you will transition. We will get to Medicare for All, and then your step to single player is so short I would make it an earned benefit, just like Social Security, so that buy in your whole life- It is always there for you, and it’s permanent and it’s universal.",

I can’t fathom what would have happened if in fact they said, “By the way, the last six months of your life, you’re on your own. We’re cutting off. You’ve used up your time.” The fact of the matter is, that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare. To build on what we did. Secondly, to make sure that everyone does have any option. Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance, or no insurance, they in fact could buy in in the exchange to a Medicare-like plan. The way to do that, you can do it quickly. Look, urgency matters. There’s people right now facing what I faced, and what we faced, without any of the help I had. We must move now.

I will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. And I will ensure that with this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand, is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country, and not about locking children up, separating them from- And not about locking children up, separating them from their parents. And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people. A mother, who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, to come here. Why would that mother do that? I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says, “Go back to where you came from.” That is not reflective of our America, and our values, and it’s got to end.",

So I would do a few things. First I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border. I would have a community based treatment center where you’re doing it within the communities, where asylum seekers are given lawyers, where there’s real immigration judges, not employees of the attorney general, but appointed for life, and have a community based system. I would fund border security. But the worst thing President Trump has done is he’s diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism, cross border human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking, and he’s given that money to the for-profit prisons.

So as attorney general, and the Chief Law Officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state, that they did not have to comply with detainers, and instead, should make decisions based on the best interest of public safely of their community. Because what I saw, and I was tracking it every day, I was tracking it and saw that parents, people who had not committed a crime, even by ICE’s own definition, were being deported. But I have to add a point here. The problem with this kind of policy, and I know it as a prosecutor. I want rape victim to be able to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her.

It got 68 votes in the Senate. That had 46 billion dollars of border security in it. That was sophisticated 21st Century border security, not a medieval wall.

In the last five years, civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system. Your community of South Bend, Indiana has recently been in uproar over an officer-involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now 6% black in a city that is 26% black.

Until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism, whatever this particular incident teaches us, we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there’s a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from what’s happened in the past but from what’s happening around the country in the present. It threatens the wellbeing of every community.

When the door is closed and the negotiations are made there are conversations about women’s rights and compromises have been made on our backs. That’s how we got to Hyde. That’s how the Hyde Amendment was created, a compromise by leaders of both parties. Then we have the ACA.

What we need to know is … Imagine this one question. When we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office, God forbid, to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women’s rights?

          "text": "All right, well on Election Day 2020, Donald Trump will be something he was not on Election Day 2016. That is, President Donald Trump, and incumbent, running for re-election. In some ways, a re-election campaign for a President, of course, becomes a referendum on how folks feel the President did during his four years in office. So what can we say about how voters have been reacting so far to the Trump Presidency? Well, what you see here, this is his average approval rating, meaning you’ve always got these different polls out there. One day, NBC will have one. The next day, CNN will have one. They’re always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day-to-day average of all of those polls, put together. What you see here in this trend line is it’s a very narrow range that Trump is operating in. What I mean by that is look at this. This is his high watermark, his peak, as President. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. When was this? Early February 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become President. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70%, at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons. Trump’s honeymoon, he couldn’t even crack 50%. So already, we see a lower ceiling for Trump than we’ve seen with past Presidents, but that comes with a flip side. That is the basement for Trump. Look at this. 37% is the low point he’s hit in his average approval rating as President. That is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone. We’ve seen Nixon, Bush Senior, Carter, we saw them fall into the 20’s at some point during their term. That has not happened to Trump, either. 37 on the low end, 46 on the high end. Right now, somewhere in between. It’s a very narrow range. It speaks to polarization. I’ll tell you, it speaks to something else. Is this Presidency really any different politically in terms of how it’s being received than the campaign in 2016, because compare this trend line. 46, 37, low, high, compare that to Trump’s support against Hillary Clinton in the polls in the Fall of 2016. Trump’s average support, at a low point, 36%. At a high point, about 43.5%. Of course, on Election Day, what was the number he hit? 46%, the same high watermark he’s had in his approval rating, so Trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate, as President. We say it speaks to polarization. It also speaks to… Look, this is somebody who succeeded as candidate in 2016 despite some very, very high negative numbers. What I mean by that is look at this, the exit poll on Election Day. “Do you think Donald Trump is qualified to be President?” Only 38% said they thought he was qualified for the job. The clear majority said Trump wasn’t qualified. Does he have the temperament? 35% said he had the temperament. Do you like him, do you have a favorable view? Only 40% did. You’re not supposed to be able to win with those numbers. Trump was one of the big reasons his opponent, Hillary Clinton, by Election Day 2016, almost as unpopular as he was, only 43% favorable. It created that narrow path for Trump, and that becomes the question when you look at that approval rating now. In 2020, can he make his opponent as unpopular on Election Day as Clinton was in ’16?",

That’s when all the talk ends and the voting begins and that massive, gigantic, enormous democratic presidential field, it gets thinned down, and maybe by the end of that month we’ll even have a pretty good sense who the nominee’s going to be. You know, Iowa, always in that lead-off position. The Iowa caucuses, there it is. Monday, February 3rd. The race begins in Iowa. And then traditionally, it is an eight-day stretch from Iowa to New Hampshire. First caucuses in Iowa, first primary in New Hampshire eight days later. So, you expect however many candidates are left when they get to the starting line in Iowa, there’s probably going to be far fewer eight later. Between Iowa and New Hampshire, you can expect a lot of winnowing to take place. You’ll have some clear candidates who are out in front, as well. The next stop, this is a new one on the democratic … A relatively new one, only the last couple cycles. Nevada, caucuses in Nevada, that’s the next one. And then the big one, obviously, the South Carolina primary. The first in the South primary at the end of the month. And of course, South Carolina, very important because this is the first date where you’re going to have a really substantial black population voting. 60%, more than 60% of the Democratic electorate in the 2016 South Carolina primary was African American. So, a key test there. Four individual contests. We’ll talk only about these states the nights they come in. That’s going to be February, but then flip the calendar. From the last day of February, look at this. Go into March. Just a couple days later, Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday, let me give you a sense of what that looks like. Massive, enormous. You go from one contest at a time, all in the same … You got California, you got Texas, you got a bunch in the South. You got Massachusetts, Minnesota. All of these states all at once. So, February’s going to produce some clarity in terms of who is a contender. Super Tuesday, mega primary, that could give us some real answers potentially in early March. ( silence)",
