I say this with a deep sense of gratitude for every single person who got in this fight, every single person who tried on a new idea, every single person who just moved a little in their notion of what a President of the United States should look like. I will not be running for President in 2020, but I guarantee I will stay in the fight for the hardworking folks across this country who have gotten the short end of the stick over and over. That’s been the fight of my life and it will continue to be so. So, does anyone have a question? [crosstalk 00:00:51].",

And I’ve had a chance to get out there and talk with millions of people and we have ideas now that we talk about that we just weren’t talking about even a year ago, a 2 cent wealth tax and universal childcare that could be real. We could make it happen, and canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans, and raising Social Security payments. Those are life changing events for people. And we could actually do this.

I had gotten a long email from my nephew and how proud his dad, my brother is, and how they were all had their plans to vote and have met other people. And it is, it’s these long ties, for that moment standing in the booth, I missed my mom and my dad. Gender in this race, that is the trap question for everyone. If you say, “Yeah. There was sexism in this race.” Everyone says whiner.

All of the staffers who moved and worked long hours, gave up jobs to be here, took leaves from school to think about what works for them. This isn’t just about me, this is a whole lot of people who were a big part of this. And also our volunteers, to try to think through for all those people who already have invested so many hours and so much of their heart and the phone calls and the door knocks and the coming to the office and help clean things up and keep it all going. And thinking about all those pinky promises, I take those pinky promises seriously. So those were the things I needed to think through and to how we make all those pieces work at least as best we can for everyone. And one last thing, it’s about all the people who are affected by all the issues I’ve talked about, whether they got involved in my fight or someone else’s fight or even not at all. But however we talk about this, there still is a trillion and a half dollars of student loan debt outstanding. There are still tens of millions of people across this country who one bad medical diagnosis and they’re upside down financially. There are still mommies and daddies all across this country who can’t finish their education, can’t take on jobs, because they can’t find access to decent childcare that they can afford. And I had to think a lot about where is the best place for me to go to keep fighting those fights, because those problems don’t disappear when I stand here in front of you. Those problems go on. And my job is to keep fighting and to fight this smartly and effectively as I can. [crosstalk 00:08:30] Thank you.",
