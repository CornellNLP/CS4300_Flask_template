In winter, take your cross-country skis to enjoy one of the peaceful, snow-covered loop trails.  Just a short drive from downtown Ithaca, this 150-acre preserve on the northern hillside of the Ellis Hollow valley has 2 miles of hiking trails. The parking area and initial stretch of trail gives no hint of what's to come.  After 500 feet you will find an informational kiosk which marks the junction where the trail splits into a series of nested loops.  Starting to the left will take you along a stream and through a forest where shady eastern hemlock often dominates.  The path on the right winds up and around a somewhat terraced hillside through a mixed hardwood forest.  In the spring and summer, the preserve's quiet, steepsided glens provide visitors with spectacular birding opportunities.   The streams running through the preserve drain into Cascadilla Creek, and are important for maintaining the water quality in the creek and nearby wetlands.",

There was enough mud, stream crossings, and slippery leaf cover on steepish slopes to make the trail feel kid unfriendly. It was a little much for them, but I think that wouldn\u2019t be the case in the drier summer and fall months when the ground would be easier to walk upon. I found it a great trail myself, perfect for taking a decent yet not-too-long walk without having to backtrack.",

It is a quiet forested area with opportunities for wildlife and peace. A local poet has posted some of their works throughout the system which was neat too. The main loop is about 1.5 miles and there are two shorter loops so you can easily cover about 3 miles or so if you do all three. We spotted a large owl and some neat salamanders/newts on our run. The trail is well marked and easy for trail running. There is a little elevation gain as well.  Would definitely go back if we are ever in the area again.",

You start with a strange walk alongside the power plant, but quickly dive into the trees and can enjoy the quiet babbling of the creek running next to the trail.  There are a couple different sized loops and they are minimally strenuous, but there are a couple good, short climbs that can get your heart rate up.  I would definitely recommend this hike, especially around sunset.",

It is a quiet forested area with opportunities for wildlife and peace. A local poet has posted some of their works throughout the system which was neat too. The main loop is about 1.5 miles and there are two shorter loops so you can easily cover about 3 miles or so if you do all three. We spotted a large owl and some neat salamanders/newts on our run. The trail is well marked and easy for trail running. There is a little elevation gain as well.  Would definitely go back if we are ever in the area again.",

You start with a strange walk alongside the power plant, but quickly dive into the trees and can enjoy the quiet babbling of the creek running next to the trail.

In winter, take your cross-country skis to enjoy one of the peaceful, snow-covered loop trails.  Just a short drive from downtown Ithaca, this 150-acre preserve on the northern hillside of the Ellis Hollow valley has 2 miles of hiking trails. The parking area and initial stretch of trail gives no hint of what's to come.  After 500 feet you will find an informational kiosk which marks the junction where the trail splits into a series of nested loops.  Starting to the left will take you along a stream and through a forest where shady eastern hemlock often dominates.  The path on the right winds up and around a somewhat terraced hillside through a mixed hardwood forest.  In the spring and summer, the preserve's quiet, steepsided glens provide visitors with spectacular birding opportunities.   The streams running through the preserve drain into Cascadilla Creek, and are important for maintaining the water quality in the creek and nearby wetlands.",

It is a quiet forested area with opportunities for wildlife and peace. A local poet has posted some of their works throughout the system which was neat too. The main loop is about 1.5 miles and there are two shorter loops so you can easily cover about 3 miles or so if you do all three. We spotted a large owl and some neat salamanders/newts on our run. The trail is well marked and easy for trail running. There is a little elevation gain as well.  Would definitely go back if we are ever in the area again.",

You start with a strange walk alongside the power plant, but quickly dive into the trees and can enjoy the quiet babbling of the creek running next to the trail.

        "Description": "The forest at Kingbury Woods protect over 6,000 feet along the upper reaches of Lick Brook in Ithaca.  Downstream from the preserve, Lick Brook carves a spectacular gorge on its way to the Cayuga Inlet below; here, however, the headwater streams course gently through old fields that are gradually reverting to hardwood forest.  In the spring, hikers can enjoy a 1.1 mile loop trail that skirts a vernal pool teeming with the activity of wood frogs, salamanders, insects and birds.  In the southern section of the woods stand several giant old oaks.  Dwarfing the surrounding, much younger hardwoods, these \"wolf trees\"\u00c2\u009d once upon a time spread their impressive branches in an open field with broad views of the surround countryside.  In 2008, Sheela Kingsbury generously donated the 48 acre forest.  With the addition of this property, the Land Trust now has secured over 300 acres in the Lick Brook area, helping to protect Cayuga Inlet water quality and stem the tide of development on this lovely hillside.

Protection of these lands adds another gem to the \"Emerald Necklace,\"\u00c2\u009d the Land Trust's initiative to connect 50,000 acres of public land around Ithaca.   The preserve has more than 1.5 miles of hiking trails and a universally accessible boardwalk that offers visitors a path across Six-Mile Creek and a connection to more than 15 miles of multi-use trails on neighboring state land. In addition to the wetlands, the preserve features a mixed hardwood forest, hemlock woods, vernal pools, and an expansive beaver pond.  The vernal pools provide superb habitat for spotted salamanders and wood frogs.  On an early April day, listen for the ringing birdlike calls of spring peepers and the clackety-quacking of wood frogs heralding the coming of spring, and keep on the lookout for great blue herons. The Park Preserve is renowned among local birders for its splendid array of breeding birds.  In the forest, you may hear winter wren, hermit thrush, northern waterthrush, and Louisiana waterthrush; while in the field, listen for prairie warbler, eastern bluebird, tree swallow, eastern towhee, indigo bunting, and yellow-billed cuckoo.",

We saw dozens of bright orange salamanders and a tiny toad in the woods. Unfortunately the mosquitos and flies were out in full force. Having a hat helped, as did insect repellent. 2.4 miles was a short hike but I would go back late September, early October. I would probably extend my hike into Hammond State Forest. The North entrance is the first entrance on Irish Settlement rd coming from Rt 13. Just past Hammond Hill rd.",

They are about 3/4 of a mile apart - The North lot starts with walk across a boardwalk through a marsh, and the South lot starts with a walk through some trees and small meadows.\r \r The South lot trail is a beautiful short trail that I would say is an Easy loop of about 1.5 miles.  Mostly flat land with beautiful bird activity, especially in the mornings.  There are several side branches to the loop that head over to Sixmile Creek at various points, one that heads over to an open lean-to and baby gorge, the other goes down to a swimming hole on private property.  Generally they don't mind if you swim, just be respectful and don't leave trash.\r \r A great hidden gem that is generally unused or extremely low traffic for being so close to Ithaca.",

        "Description": "Just a short drive from Ithaca, this 241-acre preserve borders Yellow Barn and Hammond Hill State Forests and a Cornell Natural Area, making it an important connector in an array of nearly 8,000 acres of open space.  Protection of these lands adds another gem to the \"Emerald Necklace,\"\u00c2\u009d the Land Trust's initiative to connect 50,000 acres of public land around Ithaca.   The preserve has more than 1.5 miles of hiking trails and a universally accessible boardwalk that offers visitors a path across Six-Mile Creek and a connection to more than 15 miles of multi-use trails on neighboring state land. In addition to the wetlands, the preserve features a mixed hardwood forest, hemlock woods, vernal pools, and an expansive beaver pond.  The vernal pools provide superb habitat for spotted salamanders and wood frogs.  On an early April day, listen for the ringing birdlike calls of spring peepers and the clackety-quacking of wood frogs heralding the coming of spring, and keep on the lookout for great blue herons. The Park Preserve is renowned among local birders for its splendid array of breeding birds.  In the forest, you may hear winter wren, hermit thrush, northern waterthrush, and Louisiana waterthrush; while in the field, listen for prairie warbler, eastern bluebird, tree swallow, eastern towhee, indigo bunting, and yellow-billed cuckoo.",

We saw dozens of bright orange salamanders and a tiny toad in the woods. Unfortunately the mosquitos and flies were out in full force. Having a hat helped, as did insect repellent. 2.4 miles was a short hike but I would go back late September, early October. I would probably extend my hike into Hammond State Forest. The North entrance is the first entrance on Irish Settlement rd coming from Rt 13. Just past Hammond Hill rd.",

They are about 3/4 of a mile apart - The North lot starts with walk across a boardwalk through a marsh, and the South lot starts with a walk through some trees and small meadows.\r \r The South lot trail is a beautiful short trail that I would say is an Easy loop of about 1.5 miles.  Mostly flat land with beautiful bird activity, especially in the mornings.  There are several side branches to the loop that head over to Sixmile Creek at various points, one that heads over to an open lean-to and baby gorge, the other goes down to a swimming hole on private property.  Generally they don't mind if you swim, just be respectful and don't leave trash.\r \r A great hidden gem that is generally unused or extremely low traffic for being so close to Ithaca.",

        "Description": "Just a short drive from Ithaca, this 241-acre preserve borders Yellow Barn and Hammond Hill State Forests and a Cornell Natural Area, making it an important connector in an array of nearly 8,000 acres of open space.  Protection of these lands adds another gem to the \"Emerald Necklace,\"\u00c2\u009d the Land Trust's initiative to connect 50,000 acres of public land around Ithaca.   The preserve has more than 1.5 miles of hiking trails and a universally accessible boardwalk that offers visitors a path across Six-Mile Creek and a connection to more than 15 miles of multi-use trails on neighboring state land. In addition to the wetlands, the preserve features a mixed hardwood forest, hemlock woods, vernal pools, and an expansive beaver pond.  The vernal pools provide superb habitat for spotted salamanders and wood frogs.  On an early April day, listen for the ringing birdlike calls of spring peepers and the clackety-quacking of wood frogs heralding the coming of spring, and keep on the lookout for great blue herons. The Park Preserve is renowned among local birders for its splendid array of breeding birds.  In the forest, you may hear winter wren, hermit thrush, northern waterthrush, and Louisiana waterthrush; while in the field, listen for prairie warbler, eastern bluebird, tree swallow, eastern towhee, indigo bunting, and yellow-billed cuckoo.",

We saw dozens of bright orange salamanders and a tiny toad in the woods. Unfortunately the mosquitos and flies were out in full force. Having a hat helped, as did insect repellent. 2.4 miles was a short hike but I would go back late September, early October. I would probably extend my hike into Hammond State Forest. The North entrance is the first entrance on Irish Settlement rd coming from Rt 13. Just past Hammond Hill rd.",

They are about 3/4 of a mile apart - The North lot starts with walk across a boardwalk through a marsh, and the South lot starts with a walk through some trees and small meadows.\r \r The South lot trail is a beautiful short trail that I would say is an Easy loop of about 1.5 miles.  Mostly flat land with beautiful bird activity, especially in the mornings.  There are several side branches to the loop that head over to Sixmile Creek at various points, one that heads over to an open lean-to and baby gorge, the other goes down to a swimming hole on private property.  Generally they don't mind if you swim, just be respectful and don't leave trash.\r \r A great hidden gem that is generally unused or extremely low traffic for being so close to Ithaca.",

        "Description": "Just a short drive from Ithaca, this 241-acre preserve borders Yellow Barn and Hammond Hill State Forests and a Cornell Natural Area, making it an important connector in an array of nearly 8,000 acres of open space.  Protection of these lands adds another gem to the \"Emerald Necklace,\"\u00c2\u009d the Land Trust's initiative to connect 50,000 acres of public land around Ithaca.   The preserve has more than 1.5 miles of hiking trails and a universally accessible boardwalk that offers visitors a path across Six-Mile Creek and a connection to more than 15 miles of multi-use trails on neighboring state land. In addition to the wetlands, the preserve features a mixed hardwood forest, hemlock woods, vernal pools, and an expansive beaver pond.  The vernal pools provide superb habitat for spotted salamanders and wood frogs.  On an early April day, listen for the ringing birdlike calls of spring peepers and the clackety-quacking of wood frogs heralding the coming of spring, and keep on the lookout for great blue herons. The Park Preserve is renowned among local birders for its splendid array of breeding birds.  In the forest, you may hear winter wren, hermit thrush, northern waterthrush, and Louisiana waterthrush; while in the field, listen for prairie warbler, eastern bluebird, tree swallow, eastern towhee, indigo bunting, and yellow-billed cuckoo.",

We saw dozens of bright orange salamanders and a tiny toad in the woods. Unfortunately the mosquitos and flies were out in full force. Having a hat helped, as did insect repellent. 2.4 miles was a short hike but I would go back late September, early October. I would probably extend my hike into Hammond State Forest. The North entrance is the first entrance on Irish Settlement rd coming from Rt 13. Just past Hammond Hill rd.",

They are about 3/4 of a mile apart - The North lot starts with walk across a boardwalk through a marsh, and the South lot starts with a walk through some trees and small meadows.\r \r The South lot trail is a beautiful short trail that I would say is an Easy loop of about 1.5 miles.  Mostly flat land with beautiful bird activity, especially in the mornings.  There are several side branches to the loop that head over to Sixmile Creek at various points, one that heads over to an open lean-to and baby gorge, the other goes down to a swimming hole on private property.  Generally they don't mind if you swim, just be respectful and don't leave trash.\r \r A great hidden gem that is generally unused or extremely low traffic for being so close to Ithaca.",

        "Description": "Just a short drive from Ithaca, this 241-acre preserve borders Yellow Barn and Hammond Hill State Forests and a Cornell Natural Area, making it an important connector in an array of nearly 8,000 acres of open space.  Protection of these lands adds another gem to the \"Emerald Necklace,\"\u00c2\u009d the Land Trust's initiative to connect 50,000 acres of public land around Ithaca.   The preserve has more than 1.5 miles of hiking trails and a universally accessible boardwalk that offers visitors a path across Six-Mile Creek and a connection to more than 15 miles of multi-use trails on neighboring state land. In addition to the wetlands, the preserve features a mixed hardwood forest, hemlock woods, vernal pools, and an expansive beaver pond.  The vernal pools provide superb habitat for spotted salamanders and wood frogs.  On an early April day, listen for the ringing birdlike calls of spring peepers and the clackety-quacking of wood frogs heralding the coming of spring, and keep on the lookout for great blue herons. The Park Preserve is renowned among local birders for its splendid array of breeding birds.  In the forest, you may hear winter wren, hermit thrush, northern waterthrush, and Louisiana waterthrush; while in the field, listen for prairie warbler, eastern bluebird, tree swallow, eastern towhee, indigo bunting, and yellow-billed cuckoo.",

We saw dozens of bright orange salamanders and a tiny toad in the woods. Unfortunately the mosquitos and flies were out in full force. Having a hat helped, as did insect repellent. 2.4 miles was a short hike but I would go back late September, early October. I would probably extend my hike into Hammond State Forest. The North entrance is the first entrance on Irish Settlement rd coming from Rt 13. Just past Hammond Hill rd.",

They are about 3/4 of a mile apart - The North lot starts with walk across a boardwalk through a marsh, and the South lot starts with a walk through some trees and small meadows.\r \r The South lot trail is a beautiful short trail that I would say is an Easy loop of about 1.5 miles.  Mostly flat land with beautiful bird activity, especially in the mornings.  There are several side branches to the loop that head over to Sixmile Creek at various points, one that heads over to an open lean-to and baby gorge, the other goes down to a swimming hole on private property.  Generally they don't mind if you swim, just be respectful and don't leave trash.\r \r A great hidden gem that is generally unused or extremely low traffic for being so close to Ithaca.",

There is also a map at the parking area that shows you these sub-trails.  Explore them all during different seasons, and if you get a chance, take a full-moon hike in the winter.  You will not regret waking up and bundling up to enjoy the quiet.",

        "Description": "The Lindsay-Parsons Biodiversity Preserve in the town of West Danby consists of 537 acres of forests, meadows, brushland, gorges, streams, kettle ponds and wetlands.  Several trails comprising a total of 3.6 miles are open year-round for hiking, skiing, and birding.  The diverse habitats found in the preserve are home to an equally diverse variety of flora and fauna.  Some rare species have been identified in the preserve and it provides an exceptional place for bird watching.  Additionally, the preserve's value for wildlife is enhanced by the fact that it borders Danby State Forest and sits along the Cayuga Inlet.   One of the Land Trust's and the Cornell Institute for Research in Chemical Ecology (CIRCE)'s goals for this preserve was to make it the world's first temperate-zone preserve for research in biodiversity and chemical ecology.  With this aim in mind, the scientists and students at Cornell have used the preserve to study the chemical interactions of organisms there.  Due to the size and diversity of this preserve, it is ideal for use by area colleges and schools for different educational purposes.  It also provides an excellent place for quiet contemplation.",

Benches throughout the trails to view the beautiful rolling hills and fields.  Trail is a little different than what is marked on the All trails app- which actually made for a better experience. Plenty of parking. It wasn't a surprise that we had a few ticks, so remember to take extra precautions.",

        "Description": "Twenty-five acres of the Stevenson Forest Preserve had been owned by the Stevenson family of Enfield since after the Revolutionary War.  In 1995, this fine old forest became the first parcel of the preserve that would eventually grow to 83 acres.  Today, visitors can enjoy a 1.2 mile hiking trail that ends in an impressive view of the Enfield Valley.  The history of the Stevenson Preserve is visible not only as paragraphs of a deed, but also in the grandeur of its trees.  The original 25-acre parcel is a patch of undisturbed forest that is quickly becoming a rarity.  A number of the trees that create a dense canopy had their start at least 150 years ago.  Unlike their counterparts in most regions of the northeast, these trees have only a faint memory of the mass felling that occurred in the rush to turn forest to farmland.  The preserve has several vernal ponds that support a variety of aquatic life.  In early spring, it may be possible to witness the migration of spotted salamanders from their winter hideaways to the shallow water. Trail visitors will notice the white-blazed Finger Lakes Trail/North Country National Scenic Trail along the way.",

        "Description": "Twenty-five acres of the Stevenson Forest Preserve had been owned by the Stevenson family of Enfield since after the Revolutionary War.  In 1995, this fine old forest became the first parcel of the preserve that would eventually grow to 83 acres.  Today, visitors can enjoy a 1.2 mile hiking trail that ends in an impressive view of the Enfield Valley.  The history of the Stevenson Preserve is visible not only as paragraphs of a deed, but also in the grandeur of its trees.  The original 25-acre parcel is a patch of undisturbed forest that is quickly becoming a rarity.  A number of the trees that create a dense canopy had their start at least 150 years ago.  Unlike their counterparts in most regions of the northeast, these trees have only a faint memory of the mass felling that occurred in the rush to turn forest to farmland.  The preserve has several vernal ponds that support a variety of aquatic life.  In early spring, it may be possible to witness the migration of spotted salamanders from their winter hideaways to the shallow water. Trail visitors will notice the white-blazed Finger Lakes Trail/North Country National Scenic Trail along the way.",

As of October 2020, the main trail (right hand trail, from parking lot) remains \"closed until further notice\", and last I knew the bridges were in pretty sad shape, so there may be maintenance being done. However the trail i take every day is easy, yet just challenging enough (a few small stumps coming up out of the ground on the trail, some overhanging branches, slippery-when-wet bridges, many twists and turns, etc.), but the main thing to look out for is the one bridge that's out. There is a small gap to clear, so don't fall in! I see a bunch of different birds and animals every day.  I've seen deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, garter snakes, blue jays, woodpeckers, blue heron, and green heron just to name a few. Very peaceful trail with nice views of the creek on one side and the forest on the other. I would not recommend it for running, it's way too narrow and slippery in spots. Definitely not for bicycles or strollers or wheelchairs. Good trail overall, about a 10 minute hike one way.",

The trail was overgrown with foliage but nothing that would obscure your passage. Bugs are out, but that is typical for this time of year.

With some just beautiful views! Took me 4 hours.  Also, I only saw one other person on the trail. Oh, and only one kinda muddy spot.  I brought my dog. He loved it too",

We did it on a 45 degree January day, so there were sections that were very muddy\u2014which made steeper sections a bit harder than they would be normally.  Two big things to be aware of for this hike: First, there are lots of places to park along the trail, however, the spot the directions button takes you to is an apartment complex that requires parking tags to park... two good spots to park include: at the bottom of Monkey Run road (a dead end that has parking at the end) and the section of the hike that crosses a one way bridge (I\u2019m not sure the road name). But, my recommendation is to figure out parking first! We parked at Cornell on Caldwell Drive and Forest Home\u2014a third good option.   Second, there are a number of sections of this hike that are very poorly marked, and these spots are often at weird intersections or spots that are confusing\u2014so be aware of this. What makes it more confusing is that from the Cornell end, the Cayuga trail isn\u2019t marked Cayuga consistently\u2014and there are a number of smaller Cornell trails that are marked. We ended up on other trails in this section, and as a result, ended up doing 11 miles total.   I suspect others also got lost or sidetracked on the other trails, too\u2014if you open up the record button above, you can see very few of those recording are similar or actually line up w the official Cayuga loop.",

The campus section is a patchwork of natural areas and civilization, but it gets a bit more wild as it goes. It passes through a variety of different ecosystems/topographies, and there are a couple spots with pretty nice views. There are also some points where the routing of the trail feels a bit arbitrary and unnecessary. The trail is pretty well blazed in most spots, but having the map and/or directions can be a helpful backup. There are no bathrooms or places to get water (except for the Plantations Visitors Center).",

The Lake View Trail leads to an expansive view of the lake atop cliffs of Tully Limestone. These lake cliffs and the specialized plant communities they support are found only in a few places in the region. The Pocket Falls Trail leads to a view of a 35-foot waterfall from the forested rim of Shurger Glen.  The main Loop Trail takes visitors through younger forest, shrub thickets and meadows.",

See the waypoint on my recording and my photo with where to look for it. It\u2019s as you are going downhill towards the creek. Good luck!",

I found a way to the creek bed by crossing it and going up then down quite steep hills. I re-started recording once in the creek bed and after crossing back over found a herd path that was FAR easier than what I did. See the waypoint on my recording and my photo with where to look for it. It\u2019s as you are going downhill towards the creek. Good luck!",

I found a way to the creek bed by crossing it and going up then down quite steep hills. I re-started recording once in the creek bed and after crossing back over found a herd path that was FAR easier than what I did. See the waypoint on my recording and my photo with where to look for it. It\u2019s as you are going downhill towards the creek. Good luck!",

                "comment": "My husband and I hiked this trail on 3-27-21 with our dog.  This is our first time doing this hike, and we really loved it.  We have hiked Buttermilk and Robert H. Treman several times and didn't even realize this hike existed until we found it here on AllTrails. We were very pleasantly surprised.  The waterfalls were beautiful, and I am not sure where the 3 waterfalls came from because it was more like double that number.  We talked to another hiker who told us that sometimes the brook is dried up, so it probably is not the same at other times of the year.  There was plenty of water flowing when we hiked though.  There was also a beautiful view overlooking the surrounding areas at one spot through the trees.   The hike was not what we consider difficult, but the climb up the hill is very steep for about 3/4 of a mile.  It was a good cardio workout, and you should be in decent shape to do it.  The trail was not rocky and we came across very little mud, no overgrowth, no bugs, and not crowded at all.  The railroad bridge in the very beginning was a new thing for us and realize the tracks are live.   Otherwise, you can traverse the water underneath, which was quite high when we were there.  We would definitely do this hike again.  it took us about 2 hours and 20 minutes to do this hike, but realize that we take our time to take pictures and enjoy the surroundings. The dog was fine and thoroughly enjoyed it too.  We would definitely do this hike again, it was a great afternoon, and more like \"real hiking\" to us compared to Buttermilk and Robert Treman. --Jennifer",

We hiked in the winter, so there was a lot of ice over the trail so the steeper parts got a bit tricky.

(The white is a big loop that takes you to the same place it\u2019s just a bit longer) A great trail overall! Not too many people and gorges views ;)",

Great hike to put some mileage. Nothing to see other then a stream with no water. It\u2019s pretty much dried out. Muddy at times due to the rain",

You have to walk over the bridge. As soon as you\u2019re over the bridge hang a right and you\u2019ll start up on the white trail. The blue trail comes off of the white trail after the first waterfall. Take this up, it\u2019s steep but so much better views. The white trail on the way back down is beautiful too, just can\u2019t see the water falls.  Phlox were in bloom, beautiful views, not a ton of people even on a fairly nice Sunday afternoon.

It is a workout even for those in good condition, but well rewarded. Once at the top it becomes a trail of gentle ups and downs always close to the brook, and almost entirely in the woods. If you go to the Blue trail it takes you back on the other side of water before rejoining the main trail. Plan on an hour and a half and when descending I suggest taking the white trail to the right. It brings you to waterfall but meanders through the woods and across many streams and a lovely ridge view.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

It was a little much for them, but I think that wouldn\u2019t be the case in the drier summer and fall months when the ground would be easier to walk upon. I found it a great trail myself, perfect for taking a decent yet not-too-long walk without having to backtrack.",

It is a quiet forested area with opportunities for wildlife and peace. A local poet has posted some of their works throughout the system which was neat too. The main loop is about 1.5 miles and there are two shorter loops so you can easily cover about 3 miles or so if you do all three. We spotted a large owl and some neat salamanders/newts on our run. The trail is well marked and easy for trail running. There is a little elevation gain as well.  Would definitely go back if we are ever in the area again.",

You start with a strange walk alongside the power plant, but quickly dive into the trees and can enjoy the quiet babbling of the creek running next to the trail.  There are a couple different sized loops and they are minimally strenuous, but there are a couple good, short climbs that can get your heart rate up.  I would definitely recommend this hike, especially around sunset.",

Trails here, which connect with the Cayuga Trail, follow the creek from the rims of forested banks and at creek level through rich floodplain forest, seeps, and wet meadows. Breathtaking views are afforded from atop 100-foot bluffs, which are continually eroded by a meandering Fall Creek below.",

It was a nice trail, so we kept going. We ended up on the Cayuga trail and found our way back to the parking lot. Determined to do the correct trail we kept walking and stayed on trail, and doubled our mileage. Great hike.",

At this point the trail heads from west to northeast through a flat field, follow the woods line on the left which will bring you back to what looks like a marked trail.

Without the Recording feature we would never have found our way, so whoever said it first, thanks, it\u2019s good advice. 2.) the prescribed route is not 2.4 miles, it\u2019s about 3.6. 3.) for about half a mile you\u2019re edging a field, which is kinda boring for kids. 4.) sometimes you\u2019re following yellow blazes, sometimes red. See also: #1. Altogether worth the effort though.",

Part gorge trail, part rim trail, part forest hike. I parked on the dead end Monkey Run Rd. and entered the trail opposite the parking spaces (I hiked counter clockwise) and quickly got off the trail. Now, most of the trail is well marked with red, but there are many many off shoots. At first start I ended up on part of the Cayuga Trail, but it easily loops back (see my recording for all the side ventures). The views along Fall Creek are AMAZING, just watch your step along the cliffs (they're bound to erode one of these days). Upon exiting the forest and walking along the meadow, it was a nice field walk, but then the red markers stopped and that's when it got confusing. I had missed the mention of this before I set out. I ended up walking quite a bit on a dirt road apparently following the Cayuga Trail with the yellow markers and finally saw where Monkey Run Trail went back into the forest on the left.  But this was still marked yellow - never again to see the red markers.  I don't generally do trails more than once (because there's just so many!) but this was a great walk in the woods and next time, I'd make it an out and back up to the field.  Use the All Trails map that tracks your progress. Some of the off-shoots yielded spectacular views - be sure to venture down to Fall Creek when you can and see the cliffs from the bottom.  Better marking for Monkey Run Trail would have made this a perfect hike.  Best advice, keep an eye on the map. At one point as I was near the end on the Cayuga Trail walking up the dirt road and All Trails notified me that my trail was complete! Hardly! I still had a ways to go.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

Enjoyed exploring the creek area and saw multiple herons along the creek. Well marked trail while in the woods but needed to follow the map on All Trails to know where to go when in open spaces. The child loved being in the woods before and after but not a fan of walking through the field. Would do this again!",

Part gorge trail, part rim trail, part forest hike. I parked on the dead end Monkey Run Rd. and entered the trail opposite the parking spaces (I hiked counter clockwise) and quickly got off the trail. Now, most of the trail is well marked with red, but there are many many off shoots. At first start I ended up on part of the Cayuga Trail, but it easily loops back (see my recording for all the side ventures). The views along Fall Creek are AMAZING, just watch your step along the cliffs (they're bound to erode one of these days). Upon exiting the forest and walking along the meadow, it was a nice field walk, but then the red markers stopped and that's when it got confusing. I had missed the mention of this before I set out. I ended up walking quite a bit on a dirt road apparently following the Cayuga Trail with the yellow markers and finally saw where Monkey Run Trail went back into the forest on the left.  But this was still marked yellow - never again to see the red markers.  I don't generally do trails more than once (because there's just so many!) but this was a great walk in the woods and next time, I'd make it an out and back up to the field.  Use the All Trails map that tracks your progress. Some of the off-shoots yielded spectacular views - be sure to venture down to Fall Creek when you can and see the cliffs from the bottom.  Better marking for Monkey Run Trail would have made this a perfect hike.  Best advice, keep an eye on the map. At one point as I was near the end on the Cayuga Trail walking up the dirt road and All Trails notified me that my trail was complete! Hardly! I still had a ways to go.",

        "Description": "The iconic Cornell Botanic Gardens Cascadilla Gorge Trail connects downtown Ithaca with the Cornell Campus among one of the most picturesque gorges in the Finger Lakes Region and was voted Ithaca's favorite gorge.  Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

Ascending over 400 feet, this historic set of stone trails and staircases was originally constructed in the late 1920's, and takes visitors through the gorge formed from ancient bedrock and past six waterfalls.  At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

I suggest starting on North rim trail as it is basically uphill the whole way and less scenic than south, but definitely still worth the trip amazing view points. Once you get half way there is another trail it is the gorge trail out and back very heavily trafficked. The gorge trail is like nothing we\u2019ve seen before, seeing the rock layers up close and the ability to walk on the rock of the fall.",

Then do the gorge trail.  Then do the South Rim to finish up.    We took about 2 1/2 hours to do this full loop, including the gorge trail to the base of the falls, and didn't particularly rush.",

Incline intense in short burst at lake end of both trail heads but not entire trail so don\u2019t worry. It is easier to start on the south trail heading west than it was the north trail. If you are starting on the west side parking lot then take the north trail first. The incline on the north trail on the east side is pretty long compared to the south trail on the east side. $8 parking per car at east side through Oct 18th then free after that. Highly suggest bringing your trekking poles, made it must more enjoyable on moderate trails.",

It is tough and tiring towards the bottom going up either direction due to many steep steps and inclined to have to climb, but it was definitely worth it! I\u2019ll be back for sure",

Great hike with the dog and two teenagers. lots of places to stop by the water and cool off when needed. Sometimes hard to distance when the path became narrow, but not too many tight spots and people very respectful of space. Can't wait for gorge to be opened again - its so lovely to climb right next to the waterfall.",

Once the Gorge Trail ends, the Bear Trail begins and the crowds thin out. Not as impressive as the Gorge, but the woods have their own charm. Treman Lake loop is pretty easy, though the bridge at the end of the loop is washed out. You either have to walk across 10 feet of shallow creek or turn around. I opted to walk across the creek and easily completed the walk back.",

It can get a bit buggy around the lake so bring some bugspray. All trails are well maintained.

There are a lot of stairs on the Gorge side and the Rim trail and pretty steep headed up or down.  We did the Gorge trail past Pinnacle rock to the road and down the Rim trail. We would have done the whole trek if we had more time.  overall great and beautiful park and waterfalls.",

The Bear Trail is a quiet forested hike with some easy rolling hills. The Lake Treman loop is above the lakeside water level and has a few moderate hills and a couple long staircases. Nice wildflowers on both the Bear trail and the Lake Treman loop, but if you're pressed for time, the Gorge trail is not to be missed.",

I love being outside but we had one or two girls who were not the outdoor pros but even they really enjoyed this hike.  We started first on the Rim trail down to the falls then went back up the Gorge Trail.  The Gorge trail has a better view of the falls but both trails together make a loop.  The falls were very pretty and seemed to go on and on!  Very pretty moderate hike, but with some stairs on the Gorge trail.",

Make sure the swimming portion is open if going on a hot day. The rest of the reviews hit it on the head except for Brickman's, which completely misses the mark. Overall, this was a great day spot with sufficient off trail accessibility to keep even experienced hikers engaged. Would visit again for sure.",

If you only have time for one trail, do the Gorge Trail, it has the best scenic (gorge/waterfalls) view.  We went midweek in November and rarely encountered another hiker.  There is a really nice picnic area with grills and tables up by Treman Lake.  I never knew the lake or picnic area existed.",

We started at the base of Rim then did the Bear trail before doubling back and finishing with Gorge trail. The Rim trail starts you off right away with a good incline, the trail was well maintained and we saw a few deer and snakes! Not much as far as view on Rim, but it was a nice hike. Bear Trail was pretty easy, not much if any incline/decline so it's a nice change of pace from both Rim and/or Gorge. Gorge trail was beautiful and nice to be doing on the way back as I prefer stairs going down than up. If you want to do stairs up and trail coming down then I would suggest you start with Gorge and come back on Rim .",

The trail is decently well kept and affords some nice views. It's a popular park: even with the weather being in the low 40s, there were lots of people (and dogs). You'll only find an agressive incline in the northern most part (near the falls) - so people looking for an easy hike can easily drive to the back parking lot and still hike most of it.",

We have done this trail before, but the waterfall was just a trickle then, so we wanted to see it at a time when it had more water flowing.  It is a very easy, flat walk to the waterfall and back, and more crowded than we like, but I think that's typical here.  The scenery is beautiful throughout the walk with some education posted along the way, which is always very interesting.   The waterfall was gorgeous, and full of water.   I really hate to be around a lot of people in nature and honestly almost rated it a 3 solely for that reason, but we knew what to expect before we came.  --Jennifer",

No real water flowing today but the foliage was great!  Hike back to start if Gorge trail. Then we crossed the bridge and it\u2019s up up up the stairs which gets you up about 1/3 of the elevation back to the start point. Stairs aren\u2019t too bad. Finish is uphill trail with some nice views back to the lake. 5 miles total for our hike. Loved it!",

It is very easy and accessible to all skill-levels, with a few benches along the way. It is definitely a clear trail, not rocky or full of roots. Beautiful view at the falls. Mostly shaded. I do this in sneakers, not my hiking boots, and it\u2019s just good exercise on a nice day. Highly recommend! Please be mindful during COVID of social distancing and masks. They prefer you put your mask on when it\u2019s crowded. It can get crowded at some points. I wear my mask below my chin and pull up over my nose when folks pass by. Swimming is actually prohibited there. But to walk along some wet parts to the side of the trails, I recommend water shoes. The dog would love to splash there, too! I don\u2019t know what that part is called but you can see it on your right (all of the rock) as you go up the trail. There are a few spots to get back and forth.",

Gorge Trail takes you to the base of the falls, as it meanders alongside a creek through a very deep gorge (400ft), and was once the bed of an ancient sea. The creek has plenty of opportunities to give your dog a drink, wet your feet, or even take a dip. The water was rather low while I was there due to lack of rain in mid-summer. Gorge Trail from the parking lot to the falls is more like a dirt road. It is very easy to walk, push a stroller, etc, with no steps or inclines. When you get to the base of the falls, the view looking up at it will definitely put a smile on your face. I also saw many raptors (eagles?, hawks?) soaring above the falls while I was there. Very cool! But then a thunderstorm rolled in, right when I was in the water under the falls. Things got sketchy really quick, but I was lucky enough to get out and back to the car before things got dicey. \r \r The Gorge Trail parking lot is across the street from Cayuga Lake, where there is additional parking, restrooms, swimming, a picnic area, concessions, a playground, boating, etc. Parking is $8 at state parks, but keep in mind that you only pay once per day, no matter how many state parks you go to. Just keep your receipt to show the attendant. \r \r May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

Good hike for the pups, when we went it was super dry, must be a drought.. we went on a Tuesday, crowded on the lower trail but pretty low to moderate traffic for us on the upper trails. Signs say no swimming everywhere but we saw a few people swimming, mostly kids. There were a few spots on the lower stream were there weren\u2019t any people. so we were able to take the pups off the leash so they could swim in a few of the watering holes.(not sure if you could do that on a weekend).

No swimming on the trail, but plenty of places to wade and get your feet wet. Swimming is easily accessed from a stone beach in the lake on the south east side of Taughannock State Park.",

The creek bed was pretty dry on my last visit (due to drought conditions), but there's usually ankle deep water flowing that you can take off your shoes and walk in. The rock is flat & smooth there also. \r \r The falls are higher than Niagara Falls, but very narrow. They were just a trickle during our last visit, but they are still majestic. There is also a great lookout from the upper rim that is a really good place for photos.  \r \r The gorge trail is short, less than a mile and is very easy. We did this as a 2nd hike for the day and we were in & out in less than 2 hours. The gorge trail is good for dogs and children. I definitely would recommend this one for the views alone.",

There had been a good amount of rain so the falls were majestic!  Be sure to check out the Upper Falls where the North and South Rim Trails meet at the top.

I would recommend the gorge trail for those with your little one that begins at the bottom going straight to the waterfall, shaded and it's not steep. It's closed half way there but you can walk on the dried river bed towards the falls. The rim trail going up from gorge trail is pretty steep and there are several roots on the floor so watch your step, but it has points where you can stop and sightsee, and it's shaded as well. I'm definently coming back during the fall!",

I suggest starting on North rim trail as it is basically uphill the whole way and less scenic than south, but definitely still worth the trip amazing view points. Once you get half way there is another trail it is the gorge trail out and back very heavily trafficked. The gorge trail is like nothing we\u2019ve seen before, seeing the rock layers up close and the ability to walk on the rock of the fall.",

Assuming you do both rims and the gorge trail, I'd recommend the North rim first, which has views of the falls.  Seeing them from a distance is really exciting and builds the anticipation!  Then do the gorge trail.  Then do the South Rim to finish up.    We took about 2 1/2 hours to do this full loop, including the gorge trail to the base of the falls, and didn't particularly rush.",

Incline intense in short burst at lake end of both trail heads but not entire trail so don\u2019t worry. It is easier to start on the south trail heading west than it was the north trail. If you are starting on the west side parking lot then take the north trail first. The incline on the north trail on the east side is pretty long compared to the south trail on the east side. $8 parking per car at east side through Oct 18th then free after that. Highly suggest bringing your trekking poles, made it must more enjoyable on moderate trails.",

It is tough and tiring towards the bottom going up either direction due to many steep steps and inclined to have to climb, but it was definitely worth it! I\u2019ll be back for sure",

The gorge trail is downhill mainly with on stairs. As stated, it is a one way loop ascending via the rim and descending via the gorge. There are signs indicating a one way route but there are still people who unfortunately don\u2019t follow the rule. Everyone did wear masks and face coverings though so it wasn\u2019t too bad. The trail itself was very nice but it\u2019s pretty late in the season so the gorge itself was filled with leaves from all the trees.",

Hiking with two kids (3&5), it\u2019s quite difficult to explain why we are following the rules and others are blatantly ignoring them. But that aside, it\u2019s a great hike. Just bring your mask, hike the right way, and stay out of the water.",

I started up the Rim Trail and gave up on it pretty quickly. It was SUPER crowded (on a Monday afternoon) and like 90% of the people were not wearing masks even though the trail is very narrow so most of the people were not socially distanced. The trail so also very very steep. I would not call it moderate (maybe on the way down). I walked over and looked at the waterfall from the bottom near the swimming area and it didn't have much water right now,  but it was I pretty and I'm sure is much more impressive when conditions aren't so dry.  The swimming area was closed (I was told due to lack of lifeguards)",

King Rd), walked along the shoulder of the road for about twenty feet, and walked Gorge Trail back down. Buttermilk Falls is unique in the sense that there are numerous round holes carved into the creekbed, making for awesome natural swimming pools. I saw several people swimming in these pools along my hike. I assume each of these holes were carved out hundreds/thousands of years ago when a large waterfall was at it's location, pouring thousands of gallons of water onto one spot from high above, acting like a drill, and creating a round hole. Just like getting a bucket of water, and pouring it onto dirt in one spot, creating a round hole. At one point, there is a large stone pillar right in the middle of the gorge, where water carved out the earth on either side, but leaving it to stand (see it in my pictures at the link above).  All of this is totally fascinating when you think about it!! The power and artistry of Mother Nature at her best!! The trail is very well maintained and developed, with handmade staircases and walkways built in as needed. Definitely a trail worth putting on your must-do list. May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

The Rim trail has a steep ascent at the lower end, but I'd rather walk up than down the loose-ish trail. I would definitely do it this way again, but there were people doing it the other way too. It was not too busy, but not deserted either, and swimming was closed. We did not have to pay to park at the top, which was a bonus.

Wear shoes with good grip as the wet steps do get slippery. I recommend going up the gorge trail and down the rim trail for the best views.",

Buttermilk Falls and the Buttermilk Gorge itself were great, but so was the view of the dappled sun through the trees and the wildflowers in bloom.",

If you don't want to do the full loop, start from the upper entrance (west) and you can go out on the Gorge Trail and then cross the bridge to the rim trail.

The first time we took it pretty slow and stopped a few times for pictures and water and that took us around 2 and a half hours to finish the loop. The second time we power walked the whole loop without stopping and that took 1 hour exactly. Only negative to this hike was the huge crowd of people which made it difficult to pass at multiple parts of trail. Also, if you want to ensure you\u2019ll be able to get in the park get here as early as possible because the park has been reaching full capacity before noon and has to close the entrance. Regardless, this was definitely worth the 2 hour drive from Rochester to see.",

Treman State Park near Ithaca in the Finger Lakes area.\r \r I parked in the parking lot on Park Rd (restrooms available). I decided to take Rim Trail to hike to the top, which connects to Gorge Trail for the hike back down. Both of these trails are steep, but they are both very well developed, with stone stairs to help your footing in the steepest areas. From the parking lot, it is a short walk on Park Road to the beginning of Rim Trail, which is in the camping area. Rim Trail begins behind Cabin #9. The first set of falls the trail overlooks is Enfield Falls, which is the desiginated swimming area. Very beautiful view. Going up Rim Trail a little further, you come to the base of Lucifer Falls. Looking up at Lucifer Falls is spectacular. Continuing along Rim Trail, the views are very nice. Once you reach the top, you will come to the intersection with Gorge Trail. It is well marked with signs. There is also a parking lot at that point, and there are restrooms at the far end. When you start decending down Gorge Trail, the views are absolutely amazing! There are two things you will see: 1) how powerful water can be in cutting through the rock, creating such a beautiful and magnificent gorge, and 2) how much work and effort was put into creating the staircases and walkways through this gorge. I assume everything was done by hand, along with using mules/horses. Both of these aspects are truly amazing! As you are decending Gorge Trail, you will be on top of Lucifer Falls, looking down into the gorge from above it. The views along this entire trail are inspiring and unforgettable. This is definitely a hiking trail to put on your must-do list. \r \r May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

We have a 7 and 9 year old and they did okay but it was helpful to stop and take some breaks wading in the water and they loved that.  It was a very pretty hike.  We liked that there are signs that say how far you hiked and the incline.  The only down sides were the bathrooms were not open so we had to go in the woods.  We didn't check the ones near the cabins, though.  The mill was closed also.",

We did a lot of research and read a lot of AllTrails reviews before committing to this trail. There are signs in the park directing hikers to take the Rim Trail up from the lower lot and take the Gorge Trail back down. Of course there were a number of people who apparently can't read signs, but what are ya gonna do without anyone around to enforce the rules. There were a few muddy spots, but they weren't bad. There was some stair replacement happening on our way back down the Gorge Trail and we had to carefully go around the workers. Swimming at the lower falls is currently closed due to construction/repairs. The waterfalls were amazing, definitely better than Taughannock. That said, once the Gorge Trail goes into the woods, visibility of some falls is disappointing. It would be nice if the trail ran closer to the falls the whole way instead of going back into the woods....a large portion of it seemed more like a rim trail than a gorge trail. Beautiful views, challenging hiking. I disagree with AllTrails' rating of moderate difficulty. This is not a hike for the faint of heart.",

Almost immediately greeted by awesome narrow gorge with cascades and waterfalls. We hiked to Lucifer Falls and shortly after, trail returned to basically hike through woods.  If your goal is waterfalls and narrow gorges.. visit lower falls then drive to upper entrance and hike to falls and back.  Not knocking the entire trail though. I'm sure it is great if time allows.",

The swimming hole at the bottom was pretty busy and cold (64 F!) but still lots of fun. There are bathrooms and change rooms, as well as shade and picnic areas. We stayed for about an hour, and then headed up the Rim trail. The steps at the top are brutal, honestly, but that was by far the most strenuous part of the hike. It took about an hour each way at a brisk pace, but lots of photo stops, so we spent about 3 hours there in total. Definitely wear good shoes - NO FLIP FLOPS as we saw several people doing! I prefered this over Buttermilk Falls, personally.",

The gorge trail is closed during the winter, and while the rim trail usually remains open it does get icy at times. I recommend hiking up the gorge and back to the lower parkimg lot via the rim trail for the best views. I usually do this trail loop in under 2 hours  (moderate pace with a 'stroll' at the top to view the falls). A fair number of stairs and incline (which in my opinion makes it interesting), but my 9 year old collie does just fine. Also, a warning that you can not swim in the gorge- I have seen people get tickets multiple times for swimming. They do have a very nice guarded  swimming area near the parking lot though.",

If you want a less of a cardio workout, I recommend starting with the gorge trail and hiking the rim trail last. Furthermore, if you want to beat the crowds, arrive early in the day as both trails get heavily trafficked. Check out the Old Mill museum, it provides lots of great information and artifacts of how wheat was milled into flour in the 1800s.\r \r Please note the rim trail signage is not clear as you enter the main entrance of the park. If you go to the camping/swimming area you will find the beginning of that particular trail.",

It felt like walking through a canyon built in biblical times on. The gorge trail and the rim trail had the most beautiful and literally breathtaking stair cases. I ran the 4.7 miles starting from the cabins and found that route excellent since the gorge trail was much more scenic and less challenging so it was a good way to cool down and end the run. Careful with the slippery stairs and maybe try doing this hike at the end of the day while the sun is just setting and rays of light drift through the lightly wooded forest and highlight the falls.",

Some people venture off the trails (Although, I'm not sure it's allowed per park signs) and waded/ sat in the rivers.    We wore boots even though a lot of the trail was paved/gravel, an old pair of tennis shoes would be fine. There are some inclines if you go up the Rim Trail to the top, which can leave you winded.  Traffic wasn't terrible either until you got to the actual falls, where people were taking pictures.    \r We were told by some couples to avoid taking the right at one of the splits, as there is no stairs and its just an uphill climb (more difficult).  Once at the top we came back down at turned right at the bridge that has a gate on it.  After crossing the bridge, it will take you down to the swimming hole where there is lifeguards and a diving board right in front of the falls.  I wish we would have brought swimsuits for this.  Definitely pack some river clothes, swimsuits if you have kids, its something they would definitely enjoy.",

IF THIS TRAIL IS CLOSED AND YOU TRESPASS, YOU WILL BE FINED*\r \r ...I learned that the hard way.\r \r Okay, so I made a huge mistake and ended up getting bucked off an open trail and onto a closed trail.  Upon arrival, I noticed the Gorge Trail closure was clearly posted.  So I took off on the Finger Lakes trail instead, hoping to catch some good Top-Down views of Lucifer falls.\r \r Well folks, I ended up missing a trail marker, headed off down a deer path and wound up on the Gorge Trail.  I was stopped maybe an hour later by a state trooper who had been monitoring trail traffic.  I received a citation and was escorted out of the park.\r \r Please keep an eye out for trail markers if you're here off season.  \r \r I thought a citation was a little harsh especially as there were other hikers out on the Finger Lakes Trail and the Rim Trail.  Since I wasn't from the local area, I had assumed since I saw other hikers that I was in fact, on the OPEN Finger Lakes trail.  Unfortunately for me I must not have navigated a junction properly and it cost me.\r \r tl;dr - watch where you're going here.  if the trail is closed, they do not post markers at every junction, but only at the trail heads.\r \r Enjoy the pictures I took though!  They only cost me ~$500 in fines :)",

There are a considerable amount of stairs on the trail, but the effort is well worth it as you are met with various waterfalls after most ascents. Start on the Gorge Trail and make your way up a few sets of stairs bringing you level with the gorge. From here, every few minutes of walking yields great views until you arrive at the breathtaking Lucifer Falls. Finish out the Gorge Trail and hike down the Rim Trail, which covers the other side of the gorge. The Rim Trail is further from the gorge in most places but gives a quiet contrast to the Gorge Trail. Both trails add up to about 4.5 miles total. Don't forget to bring your swimwear and take a plunge off the diving board in the official swimming area near the base of the trail! The water is ice cold & refreshing. Best of all, you can hang out right on a waterfall that spills into the swimming area!",

There is also a swimming hole that can get very crowded on the weekends, but makes for a nice cool off after the hike. All in all, it's a great hike with a lot to offer, and I definitely will be coming back!",

The upper part of the loop was still closed early November, so you can't do the complete loop and cut off about a mile by having to back track a little at the top. Hopefully they'll have that fixed by spring.",

You climb multiple sets of stairs, and encounter many beautiful waterfalls on your way to the top. There are cute bridges for picture opportunities throughout the trail, and the whole hike looks magical, especially during fall and summer. Definitely worth the challenge!",

The terrain was okay to hike I wouldn't call it strenuous the uphill climb back can be tiresome. Most the trail is moist dirt so be prepared to dip ur shoes in some mud.",

Rim Trail is a steady incline for the majority then it leaves you with a ton of stairs to climb which makes you really feel the burn. The Gorge trail on the way down wasn't bad at first as there are well maintained stairs, however, towards the bottom the decline becomes a little challenging. On the whole this was a very good hike and we all felt it the next day.",

It is a beautiful trail that I would recommend starting from the bottom so you do not end up climbing the stairs at the end of the hike.  A nice mix of walking in between the tree, along the water (with beautiful waterfalls and swimming area), and in bright green meadows!  Gorgeous!\r If you don't go to the Lower Fall were almost everybody is the trail is about 4.7 miles and can be done in a couple of hours.",

The trail is well maintained, mostly hard-packed dirt and slate.

This is a pretty popular spot, so don't expect too much solitude spring - fall.",

We have been here many times over the years and like to hike in prepared with snacks and water shoes, taking a few breaks in the gorge along with some water hiking. There tend to be crowds at the trail head on either end but not as many venture through and even less stray from the main trail. If you choose to go off the path into the gorge use caution.",

The rim/gorge trails were very crowded but once we got up to the bear trail area it was much less trafficked. Certainly ideal for covid-times.  When we got to the very end of the lake treman loop, we ended up venturing in further for another half mile or so by the water and it was really pretty. Recommend if you have some time to kill!  Overall great experience.",

If you don't want to do the full loop, start from the upper entrance (west) and you can go out on the Gorge Trail and then cross the bridge to the rim trail. You'll get a great view of the upper falls from both trails! We did the whole loop and enjoyed the whole thing, but if you just want the big falls, that small loop would be great.",

The first time we took it pretty slow and stopped a few times for pictures and water and that took us around 2 and a half hours to finish the loop. The second time we power walked the whole loop without stopping and that took 1 hour exactly. Only negative to this hike was the huge crowd of people which made it difficult to pass at multiple parts of trail. Also, if you want to ensure you\u2019ll be able to get in the park get here as early as possible because the park has been reaching full capacity before noon and has to close the entrance. Regardless, this was definitely worth the 2 hour drive from Rochester to see.",

Treman State Park near Ithaca in the Finger Lakes area.\r \r I parked in the parking lot on Park Rd (restrooms available). I decided to take Rim Trail to hike to the top, which connects to Gorge Trail for the hike back down. Both of these trails are steep, but they are both very well developed, with stone stairs to help your footing in the steepest areas. From the parking lot, it is a short walk on Park Road to the beginning of Rim Trail, which is in the camping area. Rim Trail begins behind Cabin #9. The first set of falls the trail overlooks is Enfield Falls, which is the desiginated swimming area. Very beautiful view. Going up Rim Trail a little further, you come to the base of Lucifer Falls. Looking up at Lucifer Falls is spectacular. Continuing along Rim Trail, the views are very nice. Once you reach the top, you will come to the intersection with Gorge Trail. It is well marked with signs. There is also a parking lot at that point, and there are restrooms at the far end. When you start decending down Gorge Trail, the views are absolutely amazing! There are two things you will see: 1) how powerful water can be in cutting through the rock, creating such a beautiful and magnificent gorge, and 2) how much work and effort was put into creating the staircases and walkways through this gorge. I assume everything was done by hand, along with using mules/horses. Both of these aspects are truly amazing! As you are decending Gorge Trail, you will be on top of Lucifer Falls, looking down into the gorge from above it. The views along this entire trail are inspiring and unforgettable. This is definitely a hiking trail to put on your must-do list. \r \r May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

Four stars only because the lake was dried out at the top, and we saw a dead fish and crayfish...curious! Everyone was jumping in the falls on the way back so we did too, omg the water was pure heaven! Beautiful day, highly recommend!",

We have a 7 and 9 year old and they did okay but it was helpful to stop and take some breaks wading in the water and they loved that.  It was a very pretty hike.  We liked that there are signs that say how far you hiked and the incline.  The only down sides were the bathrooms were not open so we had to go in the woods.  We didn't check the ones near the cabins, though.  The mill was closed also.",

Definitely overall more on the difficult side, and there were a TON of stairs. Trail is one way and most people were pretty good about masks when it got congested.

We did a lot of research and read a lot of AllTrails reviews before committing to this trail. There are signs in the park directing hikers to take the Rim Trail up from the lower lot and take the Gorge Trail back down. Of course there were a number of people who apparently can't read signs, but what are ya gonna do without anyone around to enforce the rules. There were a few muddy spots, but they weren't bad. There was some stair replacement happening on our way back down the Gorge Trail and we had to carefully go around the workers. Swimming at the lower falls is currently closed due to construction/repairs. The waterfalls were amazing, definitely better than Taughannock. That said, once the Gorge Trail goes into the woods, visibility of some falls is disappointing. It would be nice if the trail ran closer to the falls the whole way instead of going back into the woods....a large portion of it seemed more like a rim trail than a gorge trail. Beautiful views, challenging hiking. I disagree with AllTrails' rating of moderate difficulty. This is not a hike for the faint of heart.",

I actually received a few dirty looks for putting on my mask when having to walk by someone going the wrong direction. 1 star for the crowd and a note to photographers if you are reading this please GTFO of the way and let hikers pass. We started the hike at 11:11am and once finished a few hours later the lower lot was filling up quickly. I would recommend getting there earlier then we did to really enjoy it.

We ended at a nice big water fall and then walked back quickly through the rain. Took 2 hours at a moderate pace.",

We then started up Gorge trail but after half mile, realized that section is mostly just a steep walk in woods. We came back down and drove to upper entrance and came in Gorge trail from top. Almost immediately greeted by awesome narrow gorge with cascades and waterfalls. We hiked to Lucifer Falls and shortly after, trail returned to basically hike through woods.  If your goal is waterfalls and narrow gorges.. visit lower falls then drive to upper entrance and hike to falls and back.  Not knocking the entire trail though. I'm sure it is great if time allows.",

The swimming hole at the bottom was pretty busy and cold (64 F!) but still lots of fun. There are bathrooms and change rooms, as well as shade and picnic areas. We stayed for about an hour, and then headed up the Rim trail. The steps at the top are brutal, honestly, but that was by far the most strenuous part of the hike. It took about an hour each way at a brisk pace, but lots of photo stops, so we spent about 3 hours there in total. Definitely wear good shoes - NO FLIP FLOPS as we saw several people doing! I prefered this over Buttermilk Falls, personally.",

The gorge trail is closed during the winter, and while the rim trail usually remains open it does get icy at times. I recommend hiking up the gorge and back to the lower parkimg lot via the rim trail for the best views. I usually do this trail loop in under 2 hours  (moderate pace with a 'stroll' at the top to view the falls). A fair number of stairs and incline (which in my opinion makes it interesting), but my 9 year old collie does just fine. Also, a warning that you can not swim in the gorge- I have seen people get tickets multiple times for swimming. They do have a very nice guarded  swimming area near the parking lot though.",

If you want a less of a cardio workout, I recommend starting with the gorge trail and hiking the rim trail last. Furthermore, if you want to beat the crowds, arrive early in the day as both trails get heavily trafficked. Check out the Old Mill museum, it provides lots of great information and artifacts of how wheat was milled into flour in the 1800s.\r \r Please note the rim trail signage is not clear as you enter the main entrance of the park. If you go to the camping/swimming area you will find the beginning of that particular trail.",

The FLT has a couple steep downgrades, but is a pleasant variation for the return leg to the parking lot from Lucifer Falls.",

It felt like walking through a canyon built in biblical times on. The gorge trail and the rim trail had the most beautiful and literally breathtaking stair cases. I ran the 4.7 miles starting from the cabins and found that route excellent since the gorge trail was much more scenic and less challenging so it was a good way to cool down and end the run. Careful with the slippery stairs and maybe try doing this hike at the end of the day while the sun is just setting and rays of light drift through the lightly wooded forest and highlight the falls.",

We wore boots even though a lot of the trail was paved/gravel, an old pair of tennis shoes would be fine. There are some inclines if you go up the Rim Trail to the top, which can leave you winded.  Traffic wasn't terrible either until you got to the actual falls, where people were taking pictures.    \r We were told by some couples to avoid taking the right at one of the splits, as there is no stairs and its just an uphill climb (more difficult).  Once at the top we came back down at turned right at the bridge that has a gate on it.  After crossing the bridge, it will take you down to the swimming hole where there is lifeguards and a diving board right in front of the falls.  I wish we would have brought swimsuits for this.

IF THIS TRAIL IS CLOSED AND YOU TRESPASS, YOU WILL BE FINED*\r \r ...I learned that the hard way.\r \r Okay, so I made a huge mistake and ended up getting bucked off an open trail and onto a closed trail.  Upon arrival, I noticed the Gorge Trail closure was clearly posted.  So I took off on the Finger Lakes trail instead, hoping to catch some good Top-Down views of Lucifer falls.\r \r Well folks, I ended up missing a trail marker, headed off down a deer path and wound up on the Gorge Trail.  I was stopped maybe an hour later by a state trooper who had been monitoring trail traffic.  I received a citation and was escorted out of the park.\r \r Please keep an eye out for trail markers if you're here off season.  \r \r I thought a citation was a little harsh especially as there were other hikers out on the Finger Lakes Trail and the Rim Trail.  Since I wasn't from the local area, I had assumed since I saw other hikers that I was in fact, on the OPEN Finger Lakes trail.  Unfortunately for me I must not have navigated a junction properly and it cost me.\r \r tl;dr - watch where you're going here.  if the trail is closed, they do not post markers at every junction, but only at the trail heads.\r \r Enjoy the pictures I took though!  They only cost me ~$500 in fines :)",

There are a considerable amount of stairs on the trail, but the effort is well worth it as you are met with various waterfalls after most ascents. Start on the Gorge Trail and make your way up a few sets of stairs bringing you level with the gorge. From here, every few minutes of walking yields great views until you arrive at the breathtaking Lucifer Falls. Finish out the Gorge Trail and hike down the Rim Trail, which covers the other side of the gorge. The Rim Trail is further from the gorge in most places but gives a quiet contrast to the Gorge Trail. Both trails add up to about 4.5 miles total. Don't forget to bring your swimwear and take a plunge off the diving board in the official swimming area near the base of the trail! The water is ice cold & refreshing. Best of all, you can hang out right on a waterfall that spills into the swimming area!",

The trail is well maintained, mostly hard-packed dirt and slate. The geographical features of the creek and various waterfalls are interesting, with Lucifer Falls being particularly spectacular - it's so tall! This is a pretty popular spot, so don't expect too much solitude spring - fall.",

We have been here many times over the years and like to hike in prepared with snacks and water shoes, taking a few breaks in the gorge along with some water hiking. There tend to be crowds at the trail head on either end but not as many venture through and even less stray from the main trail. If you choose to go off the path into the gorge use caution.",

If you park near the Upper Falls you are basically right on top of it once you get onto the gorge trail.   Lucifer Falls is amazing water fall with a bad name.",

If you don't want to do the full loop, start from the upper entrance (west) and you can go out on the Gorge Trail and then cross the bridge to the rim trail. You'll get a great view of the upper falls from both trails! We did the whole loop and enjoyed the whole thing, but if you just want the big falls, that small loop would be great.",

The first time we took it pretty slow and stopped a few times for pictures and water and that took us around 2 and a half hours to finish the loop. The second time we power walked the whole loop without stopping and that took 1 hour exactly. Only negative to this hike was the huge crowd of people which made it difficult to pass at multiple parts of trail. Also, if you want to ensure you\u2019ll be able to get in the park get here as early as possible because the park has been reaching full capacity before noon and has to close the entrance. Regardless, this was definitely worth the 2 hour drive from Rochester to see.",

Treman State Park near Ithaca in the Finger Lakes area.\r \r I parked in the parking lot on Park Rd (restrooms available). I decided to take Rim Trail to hike to the top, which connects to Gorge Trail for the hike back down. Both of these trails are steep, but they are both very well developed, with stone stairs to help your footing in the steepest areas. From the parking lot, it is a short walk on Park Road to the beginning of Rim Trail, which is in the camping area. Rim Trail begins behind Cabin #9. The first set of falls the trail overlooks is Enfield Falls, which is the desiginated swimming area. Very beautiful view. Going up Rim Trail a little further, you come to the base of Lucifer Falls. Looking up at Lucifer Falls is spectacular. Continuing along Rim Trail, the views are very nice. Once you reach the top, you will come to the intersection with Gorge Trail. It is well marked with signs. There is also a parking lot at that point, and there are restrooms at the far end. When you start decending down Gorge Trail, the views are absolutely amazing! There are two things you will see: 1) how powerful water can be in cutting through the rock, creating such a beautiful and magnificent gorge, and 2) how much work and effort was put into creating the staircases and walkways through this gorge. I assume everything was done by hand, along with using mules/horses. Both of these aspects are truly amazing! As you are decending Gorge Trail, you will be on top of Lucifer Falls, looking down into the gorge from above it. The views along this entire trail are inspiring and unforgettable. This is definitely a hiking trail to put on your must-do list. \r \r May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

Lots of inclines but worth it. Bear trail is the best part to me, deep woods, quiet, and the air feels so fresh and pure. Four stars only because the lake was dried out at the top, and we saw a dead fish and crayfish...curious! Everyone was jumping in the falls on the way back so we did too, omg the water was pure heaven! Beautiful day, highly recommend!",

We have a 7 and 9 year old and they did okay but it was helpful to stop and take some breaks wading in the water and they loved that.  It was a very pretty hike.  We liked that there are signs that say how far you hiked and the incline.  The only down sides were the bathrooms were not open so we had to go in the woods.  We didn't check the ones near the cabins, though.  The mill was closed also.",

Definitely overall more on the difficult side, and there were a TON of stairs. Trail is one way and most people were pretty good about masks when it got congested.

We did a lot of research and read a lot of AllTrails reviews before committing to this trail. There are signs in the park directing hikers to take the Rim Trail up from the lower lot and take the Gorge Trail back down. Of course there were a number of people who apparently can't read signs, but what are ya gonna do without anyone around to enforce the rules. There were a few muddy spots, but they weren't bad. There was some stair replacement happening on our way back down the Gorge Trail and we had to carefully go around the workers. Swimming at the lower falls is currently closed due to construction/repairs. The waterfalls were amazing, definitely better than Taughannock. That said, once the Gorge Trail goes into the woods, visibility of some falls is disappointing. It would be nice if the trail ran closer to the falls the whole way instead of going back into the woods....a large portion of it seemed more like a rim trail than a gorge trail. Beautiful views, challenging hiking. I disagree with AllTrails' rating of moderate difficulty. This is not a hike for the faint of heart.",

I actually received a few dirty looks for putting on my mask when having to walk by someone going the wrong direction. 1 star for the crowd and a note to photographers if you are reading this please GTFO of the way and let hikers pass. We started the hike at 11:11am and once finished a few hours later the lower lot was filling up quickly. I would recommend getting there earlier then we did to really enjoy it.

We only did Rim trail gorge was closed but it was still a good distance. The end of the trail up to the mill was also closed but it was ok. We ended at a nice big water fall and then walked back quickly through the rain. Took 2 hours at a moderate pace.",

We then started up Gorge trail but after half mile, realized that section is mostly just a steep walk in woods. We came back down and drove to upper entrance and came in Gorge trail from top. Almost immediately greeted by awesome narrow gorge with cascades and waterfalls. We hiked to Lucifer Falls and shortly after, trail returned to basically hike through woods.  If your goal is waterfalls and narrow gorges.. visit lower falls then drive to upper entrance and hike to falls and back.  Not knocking the entire trail though. I'm sure it is great if time allows.",

The swimming hole at the bottom was pretty busy and cold (64 F!) but still lots of fun. There are bathrooms and change rooms, as well as shade and picnic areas. We stayed for about an hour, and then headed up the Rim trail. The steps at the top are brutal, honestly, but that was by far the most strenuous part of the hike. It took about an hour each way at a brisk pace, but lots of photo stops, so we spent about 3 hours there in total. Definitely wear good shoes - NO FLIP FLOPS as we saw several people doing! I prefered this over Buttermilk Falls, personally.",

The gorge trail is closed during the winter, and while the rim trail usually remains open it does get icy at times. I recommend hiking up the gorge and back to the lower parkimg lot via the rim trail for the best views. I usually do this trail loop in under 2 hours  (moderate pace with a 'stroll' at the top to view the falls). A fair number of stairs and incline (which in my opinion makes it interesting), but my 9 year old collie does just fine. Also, a warning that you can not swim in the gorge- I have seen people get tickets multiple times for swimming. They do have a very nice guarded  swimming area near the parking lot though.",

If you want a less of a cardio workout, I recommend starting with the gorge trail and hiking the rim trail last. Furthermore, if you want to beat the crowds, arrive early in the day as both trails get heavily trafficked. Check out the Old Mill museum, it provides lots of great information and artifacts of how wheat was milled into flour in the 1800s.\r \r Please note the rim trail signage is not clear as you enter the main entrance of the park. If you go to the camping/swimming area you will find the beginning of that particular trail.",

The stairs that take you up to the north ridge/Lucifer falls area are closed during this time of the year but I believe open around Memorial Day. I think the Gorge Trail is also closed at this time.

It felt like walking through a canyon built in biblical times on. The gorge trail and the rim trail had the most beautiful and literally breathtaking stair cases. I ran the 4.7 miles starting from the cabins and found that route excellent since the gorge trail was much more scenic and less challenging so it was a good way to cool down and end the run. Careful with the slippery stairs and maybe try doing this hike at the end of the day while the sun is just setting and rays of light drift through the lightly wooded forest and highlight the falls.",

We wore boots even though a lot of the trail was paved/gravel, an old pair of tennis shoes would be fine. There are some inclines if you go up the Rim Trail to the top, which can leave you winded.  Traffic wasn't terrible either until you got to the actual falls, where people were taking pictures.    \r We were told by some couples to avoid taking the right at one of the splits, as there is no stairs and its just an uphill climb (more difficult).  Once at the top we came back down at turned right at the bridge that has a gate on it.  After crossing the bridge, it will take you down to the swimming hole where there is lifeguards and a diving board right in front of the falls.  I wish we would have brought swimsuits for this.  Definitely pack some river clothes, swimsuits if you have kids, its something they would definitely enjoy.",

IF THIS TRAIL IS CLOSED AND YOU TRESPASS, YOU WILL BE FINED*\r \r ...I learned that the hard way.\r \r Okay, so I made a huge mistake and ended up getting bucked off an open trail and onto a closed trail.  Upon arrival, I noticed the Gorge Trail closure was clearly posted.  So I took off on the Finger Lakes trail instead, hoping to catch some good Top-Down views of Lucifer falls.\r \r Well folks, I ended up missing a trail marker, headed off down a deer path and wound up on the Gorge Trail.  I was stopped maybe an hour later by a state trooper who had been monitoring trail traffic.  I received a citation and was escorted out of the park.\r \r Please keep an eye out for trail markers if you're here off season.  \r \r I thought a citation was a little harsh especially as there were other hikers out on the Finger Lakes Trail and the Rim Trail.  Since I wasn't from the local area, I had assumed since I saw other hikers that I was in fact, on the OPEN Finger Lakes trail.  Unfortunately for me I must not have navigated a junction properly and it cost me.\r \r tl;dr - watch where you're going here.  if the trail is closed, they do not post markers at every junction, but only at the trail heads.\r \r Enjoy the pictures I took though!  They only cost me ~$500 in fines :)",

There are a considerable amount of stairs on the trail, but the effort is well worth it as you are met with various waterfalls after most ascents. Start on the Gorge Trail and make your way up a few sets of stairs bringing you level with the gorge. From here, every few minutes of walking yields great views until you arrive at the breathtaking Lucifer Falls. Finish out the Gorge Trail and hike down the Rim Trail, which covers the other side of the gorge. The Rim Trail is further from the gorge in most places but gives a quiet contrast to the Gorge Trail. Both trails add up to about 4.5 miles total. Don't forget to bring your swimwear and take a plunge off the diving board in the official swimming area near the base of the trail! The water is ice cold & refreshing. Best of all, you can hang out right on a waterfall that spills into the swimming area!",

We have been here many times over the years and like to hike in prepared with snacks and water shoes, taking a few breaks in the gorge along with some water hiking. There tend to be crowds at the trail head on either end but not as many venture through and even less stray from the main trail. If you choose to go off the path into the gorge use caution.",

Nice easy stroll to the Upper falls. Taking the Rim trail from the Upper parking lot is a little boring. Not much to see.",

Nothing to see on rim trail and it\u2019s 400 ft elevation gain in first .5 miles. Must go this way to come back down the gorge trail which was beautiful and well worth the trip up. A bunch of waterfalls, pools & rock formations while strolling on a mostly even paved surface with stairs.",

The gorge trail is downhill mainly with on stairs. As stated, it is a one way loop ascending via the rim and descending via the gorge. There are signs indicating a one way route but there are still people who unfortunately don\u2019t follow the rule. Everyone did wear masks and face coverings though so it wasn\u2019t too bad. The trail itself was very nice but it\u2019s pretty late in the season so the gorge itself was filled with leaves from all the trees.",

The trail so also very very steep. I would not call it moderate (maybe on the way down). I walked over and looked at the waterfall from the bottom near the swimming area and it didn't have much water right now,  but it was I pretty and I'm sure is much more impressive when conditions aren't so dry.

King Rd), walked along the shoulder of the road for about twenty feet, and walked Gorge Trail back down. Buttermilk Falls is unique in the sense that there are numerous round holes carved into the creekbed, making for awesome natural swimming pools. I saw several people swimming in these pools along my hike. I assume each of these holes were carved out hundreds/thousands of years ago when a large waterfall was at it's location, pouring thousands of gallons of water onto one spot from high above, acting like a drill, and creating a round hole. Just like getting a bucket of water, and pouring it onto dirt in one spot, creating a round hole. At one point, there is a large stone pillar right in the middle of the gorge, where water carved out the earth on either side, but leaving it to stand (see it in my pictures at the link above).  All of this is totally fascinating when you think about it!! The power and artistry of Mother Nature at her best!! The trail is very well maintained and developed, with handmade staircases and walkways built in as needed. Definitely a trail worth putting on your must-do list. May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

As per other reviews, we parked at the top and walked down the Gorge trail, and then back up the Rim trail, and I would definitely recommend that others do this too. The Gorge trail has the stairs at the bottom, and I would far rather walk down than up the stairs. The Rim trail has a steep ascent at the lower end, but I'd rather walk up than down the loose-ish trail. I would definitely do it this way again, but there were people doing it the other way too. It was not too busy, but not deserted either, and swimming was closed. We did not have to pay to park at the top, which was a bonus. I'd say this loop took us an hour and a half, stopping often to take pictures or just enjoy the view.",

We did 14 miles day 1 and 10 miles day 2 pretty casually. The trail is never very rough and most of the time if it gets steep there\u2019s steps built in. The front area of the trails can have a ton of people since it is a major park. All the ancient looking stone steps and walkways and brindles are pretty awesome though and not something you would see on most any trail.",

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.

A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

        "Description": "The Hammond Hill State Forest Multiple Use Trail System has been designed to offer family-based recreation for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-county skiing. A snowmobile trail and the Finger Lakes Hiking Trail also cross the forest. The 16 mile trail system is a cooperative effort between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Lands and Forests, the Cayuga Nordic Ski Club, the Cayuga Nature Center, the Friends of Hammond Hill and the town of Dryden. There is a short section of the trail system in the northwestern portion of the forest that is designated as an accessible trail for those with mobility impairments. One must have a DEC permit in order to access this trail with an ATV.  Please refer to the DEC website for additional information on permitted recreational use on this forest.  Also consider using the State Lands Interactive Mapper available on the DEC website at http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/45415.html to view the current recreational opportunities on State Forests.",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

Found it kind of hard to find the trail head so basically I would suggest parking in the very open parking lot to the right once you get the the location, and just crossing the road! It was pretty empty to me, but I also just came after a rain storm so that may have been why. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the trails here!",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

Mostly uphill, no water, no views, really buggy.",

Couple that with the fact that the area is crisscrossed by a  myriad of trails helps to explain why this 5.8 mile hike ended up 7+ miles long.

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

                "comment": "Very lovely trail! We did as someone else suggested and parked slightly north where the Jeep Trail starts. There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

They are dried up now and parts of the trail a little over grown, plus some trees have fallen causing the trail to divert a little. Still a fun challenge highly recommend!",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

They are dried up now and parts of the trail a little over grown, plus some trees have fallen causing the trail to divert a little. Still a fun challenge highly recommend!",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

                "comment": "I'd rate this trail Easy to Moderate compared to Breakneck Ridge (Hard) and Mount Hadley (Moderate). The trail is not too steep, and with an even surface throughout. There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

Couple that with the fact that the area is crisscrossed by a  myriad of trails helps to explain why this 5.8 mile hike ended up 7+ miles long.

                "comment": "Very lovely trail! We did as someone else suggested and parked slightly north where the Jeep Trail starts. There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Four miles of snowmobile trail cross the forest and are maintained by the Candor Valley Rider Snowmobile Club through a Volunteer Stewardship Agreement.  Horseback riding is prohibted on this forest.

They are dried up now and parts of the trail a little over grown, plus some trees have fallen causing the trail to divert a little. Still a fun challenge highly recommend!",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

They are dried up now and parts of the trail a little over grown, plus some trees have fallen causing the trail to divert a little. Still a fun challenge highly recommend!",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

The blue/green/yellow trails are sparsely marked and a bit confusing. They take just a bit of faith but are generally easy to follow (at least the green 2 trail is). Parts of the green 2 trail are quite steep going downhill, which I imagine would be pretty fun on a mountain bike. At top of hill near the junction between the FLT and the DEC colored markers there\u2019s a nice place for campfires.  The FLT passes what looks to be a very old stone cabin in the woods. Great area for exploring. We\u2019ll be back. Bonus: a giant patch of lycopods!",

There is plenty of parking and the seasonal road is in good condition. This route definitely cuts the steepness, but there is still a nice, steady incline to get to the looped trail.  Markers could be better. I recommend downloading the map ahead of time so you don't miss a turn. The trail is in great condition and there was very limited mud today even though it rained two days ago. Bugs weren't an issue today, but it was also cooler today compared with the rest of the week.  We saw about 6 groups of people. Two were backpacking the FLT, three mountain biking groups, and one other hiker. Since mountain bikes are common, it's probably a good idea to keep your dog leashed. My dogs loved it. I have a 9 year old collie and a 3 year old Australian Shepherd and both did great.",

We have had a lot of rain these past few days so the mud on some parts of the trail was expected. I would be cautious with young children on the edge of the ravine as it is very steep! A few creek crossings got our feet slightly wet but not impassable. Had no cell service the whole walk. Bugs were bad only when we stopped. Used bug spray and didn't discover any ticks.  Very pleasant day. Enjoyed being outdoors!!",

Small, lovely waterfalls good for wading. Also go through the AllTrails app to find the trailhead, Google maps will send you into the middle of nowhere! There was a nice lean-to for overnights, and the whole thing was very nicely maintained. I just wish we had had the map, because we were just guessing. We'll be back better prepared!",

There's many variations that could upgrade it's difficulty to Medium-Hard because of very steep sections but definitely there's no scrambling involved. However, the scenery is beautiful, and I encountered lots of wild life such as deer. Trails are not well marked in several sections so I'd recommend bringing a map or a compass just in case. I'd definitely do it again because of the many variations that it offers and because of it's low traffic (I didn't encounter anyone on my Saturday morning hike)",

Did an out and back one but I found a nice area for pitching a tent a little ways in where there was also a lean to.  Altogether I got in about a 7.5 mile hike and I'm looking forward to going back to do the rest.",

Across the road is the entrance to Six Mile Creek, and when the river/waterfall dries up, you can sit on the rocks under the bridge! Lots of places to explore all under 3 miles in length.   EDIT: After further exploring, there is much more to do here than expected! Many trails here, some go as far as five miles away from the preserve and lead to a huge dam! Really impressed with this trail.",

Red Tailed Hawks nest on cliffs above, Turkey Vultures and many other birds take advantage of air currents, a popular fishing hole as well.  Swimming is illegal and currents near the falls are deadly. While the park entrance is fairly flat and provides a wheelchair accessible path to overlook the creek, the path heading toward the falls can be somewhat rough and uneven. A short, but somewhat steep trail enters the woods and loose stone and earth paths provide access to Fall Creek and up close to Ithaca Falls.",

This place is super popular so it's tough to get really good photos without a lot of people around but if you're patient you can get some great reflection photos that make you forget you're pretty much in the middle of town.",

The trail begins on the right side of the bridge on Lake Street. It is an easy walk to the falls. This trail goes to only one waterfall, Ithaca Falls, and ends there. There are four other waterfalls just upstream from Ithaca Falls (Forest, Horseshoe, Rocky, and Triphammer Falls), but the trail to those falls begins on Stewart Avenue. In the link above, I posted a picture of the map that is on the bridge on Lake Street. It gives directions on how to walk to that upstream section of the trail from the bridge on Lake Street to Stewart Avenue (ten minute walk on street sidewalks, but it is steep). Also in the link above, I have GPS coordinates to where I parked in an Ithaca school parking lot, which is across the street from the trailhead on Lake Street.  \r \r May you always find peace in the scent of fresh air, in the way breeze feels against your skin, in the glistening reflection of a splashing creek, and in the sound of wind in the trees. Stay humble. Stay kind. Stay thankful. Keep hope. Keep smiling. Keep laughing. Love and respect nature, because that is where you will find a true lifetime of happiness! Also love and respect everyone who crosses your path. There is a reason why they did. If I see you on the trail, I promise to say \"Hi\" :-)",

They are interestingly located in a residential neighborhood. \r \r These falls are with in a few minutes drive of other falls such as cascadilla\r \r These falls have a fun little sitting area made of rock chairs and a rock table at the base of the falls\r \r PLEASE obey the NO SWIMMING signs!! There is a sign at the falls entrance that blatantly states you can die swimming here and sure enough, earlier this year a local college student did",
