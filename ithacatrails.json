In winter, take your cross-country skis to enjoy one of the peaceful, snow-covered loop trails.  Just a short drive from downtown Ithaca, this 150-acre preserve on the northern hillside of the Ellis Hollow valley has 2 miles of hiking trails. The parking area and initial stretch of trail gives no hint of what's to come.  After 500 feet you will find an informational kiosk which marks the junction where the trail splits into a series of nested loops.  Starting to the left will take you along a stream and through a forest where shady eastern hemlock often dominates.  The path on the right winds up and around a somewhat terraced hillside through a mixed hardwood forest.  In the spring and summer, the preserve's quiet, steepsided glens provide visitors with spectacular birding opportunities.   The streams running through the preserve drain into Cascadilla Creek, and are important for maintaining the water quality in the creek and nearby wetlands.",

        "Description": "The forest at Kingbury Woods protect over 6,000 feet along the upper reaches of Lick Brook in Ithaca.  Downstream from the preserve, Lick Brook carves a spectacular gorge on its way to the Cayuga Inlet below; here, however, the headwater streams course gently through old fields that are gradually reverting to hardwood forest.  In the spring, hikers can enjoy a 1.1 mile loop trail that skirts a vernal pool teeming with the activity of wood frogs, salamanders, insects and birds.  In the southern section of the woods stand several giant old oaks.  Dwarfing the surrounding, much younger hardwoods, these \"wolf trees\"\u00c2\u009d once upon a time spread their impressive branches in an open field with broad views of the surround countryside.  In 2008, Sheela Kingsbury generously donated the 48 acre forest.  With the addition of this property, the Land Trust now has secured over 300 acres in the Lick Brook area, helping to protect Cayuga Inlet water quality and stem the tide of development on this lovely hillside.

The vernal pools provide superb habitat for spotted salamanders and wood frogs.  On an early April day, listen for the ringing birdlike calls of spring peepers and the clackety-quacking of wood frogs heralding the coming of spring, and keep on the lookout for great blue herons. The Park Preserve is renowned among local birders for its splendid array of breeding birds.  In the forest, you may hear winter wren, hermit thrush, northern waterthrush, and Louisiana waterthrush; while in the field, listen for prairie warbler, eastern bluebird, tree swallow, eastern towhee, indigo bunting, and yellow-billed cuckoo.",

The diverse habitats found in the preserve are home to an equally diverse variety of flora and fauna.  Some rare species have been identified in the preserve and it provides an exceptional place for bird watching.  Additionally, the preserve's value for wildlife is enhanced by the fact that it borders Danby State Forest and sits along the Cayuga Inlet.   One of the Land Trust's and the Cornell Institute for Research in Chemical Ecology (CIRCE)'s goals for this preserve was to make it the world's first temperate-zone preserve for research in biodiversity and chemical ecology.  With this aim in mind, the scientists and students at Cornell have used the preserve to study the chemical interactions of organisms there.  Due to the size and diversity of this preserve, it is ideal for use by area colleges and schools for different educational purposes.  It also provides an excellent place for quiet contemplation.",

        "Description": "Visitors can explore Cornell Botanic Gardens Beebe Lake Natural Area on the one-mile loop trail around this man-made lake in the heart of Cornell campus. The scenic trail passes through mature and old-growth forests, over the historic Sackett Bridge, and past many lake views and stone seating areas that include picturesque views across the lake and the falls over Beebe Dam into Fall Creek Gorge from the Triphammer Footbridge.  These trails are also a favorite for joggers, hikers or a simple stroll. A shorter loop trail from Sackett's Bridge leads to a picnic area overlooking a waterfall tucked away in Hemlock Gorge.  While hiking the trail, visitors may take an interpretive guided tour using your smart phone by downloading \"Pocketsights Tour Guide\" from the App Store or Google Play Store. Trails here also connect with the Cayuga Trail, and trails within the Botanic Garden area, the Mundy Wildflower Garden, Cornell Campus, and additional, adjoining natural areas.",

At a leisurely pace, this 1/3-mile section of the trail takes less than an hour from the Treman Triangle Park in downtown to the upper entrance by the College Avenue Stone Arch Bridge. In Collegetown, the trail crosses College Avenue and the Goldwin Smith Walk continues to follow Cascadilla Creek for another half mile through a flat, wooded area that leads to two footbridges over scenic waterfalls. The lower gorge from Linn St to College Ave is closed during the winter months, but the gorge above College Ave is open year round.",

This scenic trail crosses through Cornell Botanic Gardens Purvis Road Wetlands Natural Area and Dryden Lake Park, following a railroad bed all the way to the Village of Dryden.  The Purvis Road Wetlands Natural Area contains active beaver dams and various wetland habitats, and is an ideal site for wildlife viewing, especially birding.",

Red Tailed Hawks nest on cliffs above, Turkey Vultures and many other birds take advantage of air currents, a popular fishing hole as well.  Swimming is illegal and currents near the falls are deadly. While the park entrance is fairly flat and provides a wheelchair accessible path to overlook the creek, the path heading toward the falls can be somewhat rough and uneven. A short, but somewhat steep trail enters the woods and loose stone and earth paths provide access to Fall Creek and up close to Ithaca Falls.",
