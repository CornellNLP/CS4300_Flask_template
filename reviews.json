However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur√©e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.","date":"2014-10-11 03:34:02"}

Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary.

However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows.

I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients.

The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment.

Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .","date":"2009-10-13 22:20:10"}

I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long (about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great.

Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.","date":"2008-04-30 01:39:05"}

However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.","date":"2011-11-29 23:53:15"}

But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.","date":"2013-01-02 15:59:38"}

That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes.

We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed.

I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota.

I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.

We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entr√©e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.

They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas!

It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \n\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.

You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.

The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting.

When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \n\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \n\nThere are some things that were still delicious.

A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\n\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\n\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \n\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \n\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\n\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits\/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \n\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...","date":"2016-11-09 20:46:13"}

And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \n\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target\/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\n\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself.

The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\n\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\n\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\n\nSeeing his site (http:\/\/www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\n\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\n\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.","date":"2012-11-06 03:30:52"}

When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\n\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones.

I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \n\nLet's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997\/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \n\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done,  until Neil came along....\n\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \n\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \n\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \n\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\n\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\n\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\n\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it's the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....","date":"2015-03-18 18:15:01"}

Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.","date":"2015-10-07 21:48:25"}

The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other.

My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \n\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \n\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria.

I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. \n\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\n\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!\n\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. \n\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\n\nMy one tiny complaint\/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small.

I will definitely be finding another salon in the area.","date":"2014-08-10 19:27:13"}

From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish).

Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office!

I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out. Paying almost $50 for a blowout that immediately fell down was really frustrating. Not sure if I would go back again!","date":"2014-04-01 02:15:20"}

I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. \n\nNow, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done.

I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \n\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.\n\nI saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, \"that's what supply and demand is.\" And walked away.\n\nI would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.\n\nYour \"lesson\" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. \n\nI know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.\n\nSincerely,\nFormer Kreuger farms fan","date":"2013-06-24 07:14:55"}

Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver.

Interesting, in a \"what?\" kind of way.  But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.

I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :O\n\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\n\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.

We ordered:\n\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\n\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\n\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\n\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\n\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed cr√®me brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time.

We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice.

I know good help is hard to find, but this is something they can work on to help with the dining experience. Despite that minor tweak, LOVE this place!!!!","date":"2012-04-28 17:11:47"}

A very basic menu, which makes sense considering they started out as a good truck. I got the veggie burger because the description sounded unique- and it did not disappoint! The fries were hot, salty and delicious, and I enjoyed dipping them in the ketchup, which almost tasted like it had some BBQ sauce mixed into it! I was tempted by the milkshake menu, but saved my dessert splurge for another place. Super easy to just sit at the counter and get served, even on a crazy Saturday night in summer when Ponce City Market was packed.","date":"2017-08-28 19:43:14"}

Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.","date":"2009-10-13 03:48:11"}

Very minimal. I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought \"almond\" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. \n\nThe plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted. If I do come back (and it's likely that I won't, partially because of my experience and partially because I rarely get my nails done) I'll shape my own nails at home.","date":"2018-07-17 01:00:36"}

Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin\/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.\n\nThere is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.  Yum!  \n\nUnfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything.

(OK, to tell you the truth it seemed like a hassle to be sent sample frames, send them back etc.) But while on vacation in Austin 2 weeks ago, I noticed this huge Warby Parker store downtown and figured it couldn't hurt to see if I could at least pick out frames there and then order online. Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all!

I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.","date":"2016-08-25 15:42:13"}

Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.\n\nMarvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.\n\nWhen she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.\n\nFor herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.\n\nThe portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.\n\nThe rest of us shared two ¬º Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter \/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.\n\nI liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!\n\nWe enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.\n\nThough we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\n\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server\/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\n\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\n\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\n\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.","date":"2015-11-18 19:21:19"}

I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice!

I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\n\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service.

It is all depending on what you order.  I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi.  If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.","date":"2016-12-19 15:18:19"}

If you can get a west facing, high story room then it's worth it.  \n\nThe only thing that could have improved that view is if they had had chairs out on the balcony.  It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \n\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  \n\nThis hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \n\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \n\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.

The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.\n\nThe biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.\n\nThe fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.\n\nI ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.

I got their $6 pulled pork sandwich lunch special, comes with fries and it was off the chain good! Service is fast and friendly. It's a small place with super limited seating.

The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.","date":"2016-08-25 13:39:33"}

The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\nOverall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!","date":"2014-04-01 03:21:50"}

Wow, this place gets crazy busy sometimes. The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.\n\nI also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.\n\nI tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.","date":"2015-03-04 19:31:39"}

Read this entire post to understand this update. \n\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \n\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \n\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. \n\nHere's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \n\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.","date":"2015-03-04 20:32:47"}

The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!\n\nWe talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.\n\nI personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.\n\nThe prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. \n\nTo address the claim of \"animal cruelty\" and \"unscrupulous breeding,\" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a spic-and-span, glossy-floored store like Petco, go to Petco.","date":"2013-01-02 15:23:16"}

My favorite was the ceviche although the octopus was a bit over cooked it was delicious , with the most perfectly cooked scallop to top it. Everything was tasty and unique. \n\nSecond course was the paella, the squid ink one was amazing, squid ink doesn't have a strong taste, I can just say it's savory I guess, the saffron one took second, giant full shrimps topped which we all fought for, so so good. \n\nThird course was desert, I have a sweet tooth so I was excited for this part.  We had creme br√ªl√©e, the top so perfectly crisp and the custard had the perfect amount of lemon, very good. We also got what I think was a cheese cake with goat cheese ice cream. Let me tell you I'm not a fan of cheesecake but the crust alone was soo yummy and the cheese part wasn't too cheesy which was perfect! \n\nThis place is so good, so good that it will be a top choice for when we have friends and family visit!\n\nNow let me tell you also, we had a few friends at dinner who had food allergies, Barlata went above and beyond with separate menus which were also full of flavor and uniquely put together. It was great!So many times I've seen my friends get served plates of boiled veggies because of their allergies but they felt very included here. Nice job Barlata!","date":"2016-12-19 15:17:28"}

With a bar and separate fast food setup and feel, I found the Mexican \"day of the dead\" decor with pop 90's music to be oddly relaxing. My boyfriend had a beef taco for $4.50 and for me we mostly shared a pulled pork taco bowl salad for $9.50. My boyfriend found his choice underfilling while i found mine too filling for one. We chose to come here for food due to its proximity to where we were taking a class at shortly.

I would have given 4 stars but removed 2 for a failure of integrity for a customer oriented business. I shop big, & very recently since October 2013 having moved to a location close to Moody Street, have started to shop here. I am a customer who LOATHES to return things, & almost never have had to do it. Once in 15 yrs shopping at Market Basket, once in 15 yrs at Whole Foods, both times because it was a wrong item that I had bought. Incident 1. Early on, I bought some snacks that had gone bad. I called them right away & When I went back there was a little fuss but the young boy who took it back admonished me & said that I should not do it again (so it was my fault!) Incident 2. A 'sweet' famous in my region has recently been made & sold here in the US. I had bought it earlier in NY & it was excellent. SO seeing them in this store, i bought two boxes - upon opening the first, we found it tasted awful & it had a weird after taste. Having had the earlier experience, i was hesitant but did bring it up with a guy at the cash counter. He said they don't take back sweets. It was sealed and frozen but OK, i got rid of it (not cheap). Incident 3 was in two parts, so bear with me - I asked for 6 samosas, (so the same man who had politely told me he would not take back the sweets), packed them & wrote the number 6 on the outside. Upon going home I found 5 samosas....so figured that I must have been mistaken that samosas are a dollar each.....& that 6 must have been the price (which would make it 1.25 each). However I was there on Wednesday this week & saw that the samosas were indeed 1.00 per samosa, so there was a mistake last time. Seeing the same 'friendly' person who had packed them last time, I told him that he had written 6 but I found only 5 inside. SO making a genial point of his generosity\/openness - he said to me, Don't worry, I'll give you an extra samosa today, 'neither you nor I are going to benefit from $1.00, (loose translation)'. So he put them in & wrote 6 outside & reiterated that there were SEVEN inside. I came home & as it was tea time, my husband opened up the samosa bag to toast - Imagine our disbelief & feelings to see that he had only packed SIX. There were no 7 in there. \n\nI am only a single customer, but I am feel I am a trouble free, good & loyal customer who goes back to the same business for ever. For me, I like the small local store connections & try to build it wherever I live. They just weren't\/aren't interested or  ready for a repeat customer like myself. I wish them well - they have some good & some great stuff - & I had to think it over a couple of days. But I can't do business if I am not treated right. So here I am looking for another shop.....","date":"2014-02-23 23:30:56"}

It opened a few weeks ago and I finally got there today.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an \"excuse me\".  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return\/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.  But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing. No \"thank you\", no \"do you need a hand\", not even the now common \"there you go\".  \n\nThe place just opened! Haven't they trained the staff any customer service skills? I won't be going back.  \n\nAnd, the prices are not that great.

Whatever--looked like every other bar\/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.\n\nWell--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. \n\nI never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. \n\nInstead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.\n\nAnyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalape√±o burger, which came with fried jalape√±os. The burger had only a couple of jalape√±os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.\n\n\nWhatever--this place just didn't do it for me.

Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person)\n\nThey did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that.\n\nOh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee.

I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place.

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. \n\nI would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.","date":"2014-06-11 15:34:50"}

I live in St. Johns and go there at least 3 times a week with my dog to wear her out. I spend most of my time on the Newton Road trailhead and have a few loops around there that I love to watch change with the seasons. \n\nConfession: Forest Park has a strict leash requirement which I consistently break with my dog. I know this is bad and naughty. I do keep my dog under control and as a canine good citizen and wildlife conservation dog, she is very well trained. \n\nThat said, I have a big concern. The last time I was in the park, a park employee or volunteer was out spraying herbicides on the blackberries to get rid of them. They told me my dog should be on leash because, 1.) them's the rules and 2.) the herbicide can cause serious eye damage to animals that come in contact with it. As long as we stay on the trail, it should be fine, they told me. This concerned me greatly because, of course, I don't want my dog near any kind of herbicide that can make it go blind and more importantly, no one gave that memo to the wild birds, rodents and mammals that live in the park. Such a bummer! I'd happily thrown in extra time to help eradicate blackberries manually or contribute to a fund that would employ workers to tear out the blackberries in a way that doesn't involve dangerous poison. \n\nAnyway. Yelp always filters my reviews, so this will probably never see the light of day, but thought park fans should know that there are dangerous herbicides being sprayed throughout the park and to be careful not to let your dog come into contact with them.","date":"2012-10-08 19:06:32"}

I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite.\n\nAnd they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up.

There are just too many amazing things to share about WCA.  During the holidays I wanted to bring in a thank you gift but was unsure how to proceed... I'm not into baking... a card?  Needles?  What could express my gratitude?  Well, I got distracted so here I am writing a review to say thank you and save face.\n\nSpeaking of saving face... WCA actually SAVED MY FACE!!!!  I woke up with Bell's Palsy November 17th and made it into WCA four days later after a recommendation from a friend.  Bell's Palsy is a strange inflammation of the facial nerve where half your face becomes paralyzed.  Most people take about four months to recover from what I researched, but many people do not recover or only partially recover.  I could deal with looking \"different\" but the discomfort was really hard to ignore.  I wanted to get better.\n\nNot having health insurance that covered acupuncture at the time, I was unsure how to proceed.  Most acupuncturists charge a minimum of $75 a visit in my experience.  This is a lot to take on for an acute condition that requires repeat visits.  I'd driven by WCA many times, as it is in my neighborhood, so I decided to stop in and see if it was \"for real.\"  How could they charge a sliding scale of $15-$35 and stay in business?  The short answer is that unlike most Western acupuncture offices, WCA practices the community acupuncture model (which they developed).  Community acupuncture more closely resembles what you might find in places where acupuncture is more traditionally practiced.  There is a room with recliner chairs and blankets where many patients are seen at once.  In this way, the acupuncturist can see more patients in one day than a typical Western practitioner and the patients can gather in what becomes a true place of healing.  Business is better for acupuncturists in community acupuncture and patients get access to affordable health care.  Check out the documentary made about WCA and the growing co-op of community acupuncture clinics: http:\/\/workingclassacupuncture.org\/?id=7\n\nAt this point you may have left the review... but I warned you I get wordy...!  Okay so I went to WCA for the first time and met Adrian, an acupuncturist beyond enthusiastic about her work.  She was so positive and caring and gave me a lot of hope.  She said I should try to come in as often as possible at the beginning -at least seven of the next ten days.  So, I did.  I went into WCA as my schedule permitted and stayed for an hour each time.  I was not particular about which acupuncturists I saw, as I knew each one would have his or her own style and method of treatment.  I appreciated each and every acupuncturist who helped me and felt their individual gifts as healers.  Some are deliberate and take their time, but most are lightning fast.  Before you know it, you have tons of needles working their magic all over.  Sometimes I'd wonder.. when did she even put that needle in?! All the acupuncturists offer you blankets and check on you often.  It's extremely comforting, relaxing, and restful.  \n\nThe interior of WCA Cully has reminded me of a womb from the first day.  The ceiling, walls, chairs, etc., all look soft and comforting.  This might seem weird but I really think it taps into a nurturing that is very basic and relatable.  The acupuncture's efficacy is a mystery and this swaddled up atmosphere fits right in.  There is also just a wonderful and powerful communal sense of healing here.  So many people coming in to take care of themselves and be healthy.  \n\nWCA is relaxing, welcoming, comforting, but does it actually work?  YES.  My face began improving from the first visit!  I could feel immediate improvements!  Besides that, it just gave me such relief from the discomfort and pain involved with the Bell's Palsy.  I felt very cared for each and every time I visited and the acupuncturists were always congratulating me on the improvements in healing.  I feel very vulnerable when I sit down and begin talking to each acupuncturist.  It's not always easy to share what worries or troubles you. Some people are scared of the needles.  I recommend everyone give it a try if you are curious.  The acupuncturists will go at your speed and make sure you are always comfortable.  \n\nWCA wants everyone to feel empowered to take charge of their own health and have access to affordable care.  I am so appreciative and have recommended countless people visit.  It took me about 45 days to achieve almost full recovery of my facial paralysis.  This is SO fast compared to what I've seen and heard from others!!!  I am so appreciative and now 3 months later and with my face 99.9% functional, I find myself back at WCA for help with other issues.  Maybe I just like resting in the womb in a recliner with blankets.  But really, I know WCA is my best option for healthcare.  And how lucky am I to have them close by!","date":"2015-02-24 05:43:21"}

I been a member since 2014,  at the Hillsboro location and had amazing Brenda work on my facials. I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole, despite all the horrible reviews about this place; I decided to open a new a membership.\n I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building 80 hours + so I scheduled an appointment and didn't get Nicole, I booked on the same day with a diff person - I went in excited, however this time not even minutes of my facial; the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning , she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution. After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident , I was not given the number to their manager , while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin, cheeks , jaw line, upper lip, and forehead. Come on? Really, why would anyone use so much strength on a facial???? And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. I've never had problems with Dermalogica products. I'm not coming back. As I'm writing this post my face is still burning - I went in at 8:30 pm and it's now 10:44 and I'm holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn.\nUpdate: received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem, I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message.  She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership , instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE, she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my \"boyfriends credit card\", wow I'm so disgusted with this place - so irrelevant and uneducated response.

At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.

We got there around 8 and there was a nice, pleasant crowd. The music often surprised me with a throw back from my childhood (hats off to the dj). All of the games are free to play and there wasn't a cover. The beers were reasonably priced and I didn't mind paying a little more since we were playing free games. The decor was impressive. A very interesting cocktail menu...we ordered 'Weird Science' and it was entertaining AND not bad tasting! 15$ well spent since it was a beverage that was fun and delightful. \nThe place started getting packed around 1030, 11 on a Thursday night. That's when you find yourself waiting for a turn on the games and so we called it a night at about 1130. Had a blast and couldn't stop ranting about it. \nThe only qualm I Had (which also reminded me of my youth) was the temperment of the Atari and ninetendo, having to fiddle with the games to get them to work...which wouldn't discourage me to return!

Yes, the Mallard Tower is the older building, but when we looked to switch to the newer tower due to our a\/c not working so well, I didn't like the size\/layout of the room.

The convenience factor is huge, but the service is what sold me. It was impeccable. Every single person is incredibly accommodating and nice!

I've eaten in once and had take-out once.  Dining in one afternoon at 4pm I decided to sit at the bar with (as my lady friends put it) the Spanish version of Fabio.  He was nice, albeit rather slow and seemed to be new at his job.  I'll start by saying how cool it is that you can order off of Teela's menu, or from their neighboring sister restaurant, Tin Can Fish House and Oyster Bar.\n\nI opened with the calamari, which was crappy.  It was only half breaded, undercooked, and kind of soggy.  The squid was served on cheap plastic trays (are we in a food court or something?) and both tartar sauce and cocktail sauce tasted like they came out of a can.  It's not hard to make either of those in house, I do at my own restaurant.  \n\nA note on service: the calamari came out a good 20 minutes after I ordered it (usually takes 90 seconds in the fryer) but my tacos were prepared in a matter of minutes.  That's not a good way to stagger a multi-course  meal, especially with only a dozen customers present.\n\nThe tacos were another story.  I had the Pork Carnitas with Corn and Pepper Pico de Gallo, Onions, and Cilantro.  The meat was tender and juicy, but a little too fatty.  The tacos are loaded, and the corn pico\/onions\/cilantro was a killer topping.  My next taco was amazing: Chorizo Stuffed Dates with Bacon Bits and Feta.  The sausage was authentic and mildly spicy, which balanced out the sweet fruitiness of the dates.  And bacon bits?  Ahem, more like bacon STRIPS.  Like 6 of them.  Crispy, meaty goodness.  There was a huge amount of feta, too much actually, but I just pulled some off.\n\nUnfortunately, a week later my friend brought me a Chorizo taco that was decent at best.  The proportion of meat and toppings was way off, my bacon strips turned into bits, and something just tasted wrong.  I also had their Brisket taco, whose meat was tender and tasty but the toppings\/condiments didn't add up.  \n\nYes, I'll be back to try more tacos, maybe some beers after work.  And if you like oysters I overheard the woman next to me talk about $0.25 oysters available one day of the week (Tuesday, perhaps?).","date":"2011-06-29 04:09:31"}

This particular Unos I've been to more times than I can count and I've had at least 3 other bad customer service experiences, but the one I had tonight takes the cake.  The guy I had twice before was so negligent that I got his name from my check and memorized it so that when I returned I'd ask that they seat me anywhere but his area.\n\nI came in today and asked for a one person booth for one and she says they don't have any so they had to seat me in the back where all the tables are.  Ok, no real problem, but I was there alone, and it wasn't peak hours just yet; it was obvious that I just wanted to eat and enjoy a meal with minimal disturbance or distraction.  And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.  Even in mall foodcourts, total strangers don't sit directly next to one another, let alone at an uncrowded sit-down restaurant.  \n\nThen, maybe 10 minutes later, they came back and seated a party of two DIRECTLY next to me.  It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n\nMy whole issue really is that they don't seem customer service centered and reading some of the other reviews, they don't make common sense decisions with their customers.  3 distinct times I've walked out of there in a huff because of the treatment.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.  To be fair, the food is consistent and I have had some really good waiters here and there, but again, it's too much of a gamble.","date":"2015-12-05 04:22:59"}

I just started taking guitar lessons from Alex a few weeks ago after taking lessons with a previous instructor for about a month and a half. The reason I quit my lessons with my previous instructor was because the lessons consisted mostly of him just teaching me new chords and having me play the chords\/various simple songs over and over at increasing speeds. I felt like I could've learned all of that on my own, and I felt totally uninspired after each lesson.\n\nWith Alex, it's a whole different story. In our very first lesson, he emphasized to me the importance of learning the fretboard not just by memorizing different chord shapes, but also by understanding both conceptually and instinctively how each string is laid out and exactly what notes you're playing at all times (as well as which notes make up the chords you play, why they create the sound they do, etc.). He talked about how a lot of people will learn to play the guitar by learning a bunch of chord shapes, but then when asked to improvise or make their own song will only be able to play through the chords that they've memorized by rote. By learning the fretboard by heart, we can instead hear a tune or a certain sound in our head and play it immediately, rather than relying on muscle memory for all of our music-making. He gave me an EXTREMELY useful exercise for kicking off this process.\n\nEvery single lesson with him is a great learning experience. The classes are loosely structured and he tends to ask me what I want to work on before each class. No matter what it is that I show him, he always gives me incredibly useful advice to make my playing sound smoother, add a little extra flair, etc. He's not the kind of instructor who just listens to me play, tells me it sounds fine, and moves on without offering anything useful.\n\nOn top of all of that, Alex is honestly just an incredibly likable and positive guy. He's really fun to take lessons from and he's also really really good at guitar. Unlike my previous instructor, he doesn't hesitate at all to demonstrate things when I ask him to. He can pretty much hear any guitar song and play it instantly, often adding his own personal touch to it (well, he's been able to for the songs I've showed him thus far). He has a huge knowledge base and has learned tons of cool tricks from all of his years in music. I've left each lesson so far knowing I've learned something valuable and feeling really happy and inspired.","date":"2013-04-10 16:13:52"}

I always forget about it, which is probably why I keep on going back for more, but am reminded every time I'm presented with the bowl, that I should have brought with me one of those oil separator measuring cups.\n\n2) At 7 bucks for the bare minimum shoyu ramen, I wish there was more ramen -- not to mention, one week that I went there, it seemed as if the price went UP while simultaneously, once slice of pork went away forever, never to grace my bowl again. How how u gonna play that off? Raise the price and take 1\/4 of the meat away? That's just wrong.\n\n3) This being the only ramen place in 4 square miles, it gets crowded.

There is a propensity towards putting stuff in a bowl with tasty, gooey sauce\/gravy\/broth which really reminds me of the sort of shit gluttons think up when having the 2AM munchies.  It helps that sauces are very good at Rosebud otherwise some might find the approach sloppy.  Asian flavors are also lovingly referenced in a few places, with enough restraint and good taste to not come off as ill-advised fusion experiments; though don't interest me much.  \n\nI've had dinner here about four times and brunch once.  Appetizers are mostly solid with fried oysters and bruschetta being standouts but calamari and mussels underwhelming.  A crab cake special had some of the best crabby flavors I've had but is not on the regular menu.  The best entree is shrimp and grits, rightfully mentioned as a great dish in this area by many people.  This version is a sweeter take on cajun style with a generous amount of delicious tomato gravy.  Grit is cooked just right.  It's usually a struggle to try new entrees because resist ordering this dish is so difficult.  Out of the seven entrees ordered by my party in last two visits, four were the shrimp and grits.  Surprisingly juicy is the braised lamb shank.  Decent fish (I've sampled the trout), generally good vegetable sides.  On the other hand, disappointing is the fried chicken--bland, although only slightly worse than the norm for $15 fancy fried chickens, of which I've tried many.  Another bad entree was a pork rib special, presumably smoked using the BGE outside, that turned out unpleasantly dry and we were hardly able to finish.  Brunch can be a great time to give Rosebud a first try, as it's more casual, features many grit dishes, and still has many normal items available, including the shrimp and grit.  \n\nThe beverage selection doesn't dazzle but the whole package keeps up with the times competently, with good mixed drinks, enough respectable beers (not a lot), and many wines by the glass as well as the option to go with house wine for simplicity and economy.  \n\nService is excellent and I have no problem with the fact that the chef writes a blog venting about bad customers.

Although sometimes the servers don't fill up the whole container of you ask for it to be on the side or is completely fresh, it never fails to taste amazing. It's almost as good as guacamole in Mexico, but definitely the best in Oregon.

They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. \n\nWhen you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. \n\nThe menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. \n\nFrom charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). \n\nI also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) \n\nThe burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. \n\nThe hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. \n\nOverall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.","date":"2014-12-17 18:39:32"}

I have been a VW enthusiast for over 20 years, so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando. What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice. I took my Passat in there for a brake job, simple rotor and pad replacement, when I asked the service tech I can't recall his name but he's the only guy answering phones and giving \"advice\", told me when I break in the new pads\/rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to 60 mph and brake as hard as I can. Anyone who has common knowledge\/sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you're suppose to do, I just acted like he was right, as I knew it was a bad sign, he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts. The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid, oddly, he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level. As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk, which had never done before. Having owned this car for 8 years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid, which is why he said come back? I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house, he checked the AT fluid level and said it was 2 quarts low, which was causing the jerking during gear shifts. He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone. I will never go back to Full Throttle. I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty, and that may be the case for some, but for me, based on talking and going to many shops over two decades, these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs. I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust, but all I got was weird attitude, bad workmanship, and bad advice. I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business. And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration, but rather more the norm. Lastly, when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see. He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away. He couldn't figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it, because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket, so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant.  That's it, rant done.","date":"2012-04-28 20:04:26"}

There is one specific brand\/type of mattress that we really like, and after coming up with bupkis at a couple of stores we spotted Mattress World on our way home and decided to give it a shot. I had assumed that it was a national chain, but MW is in fact locally owned and the owner was in the store. They have a lot of mattresses in their showroom, all there to be tested out. \n\nRachel, our sales woman, was very friendly and informative, she really knows the products. After laying around for a while we found the mattress of our dreams (so to speak) and she was quite willing to price negotiate. So we've got the price and set a delivery date for three weeks out at a particular time on Sunday, and the delivery guys arrive exactly on time, set up the new mattress with no drama, and take away the old mattress.

I love everything about it top to bottom.\n\nFirst, the decor is fab. You walk in and feel comfortable, but a bit classy. Its got the feel of a sports bar \/ pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. \n\nSecond, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. \n\nThird, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. \n\nfourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives\/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) \n\nThe burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. \nConsidering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable!\n\nfinally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. \n\nAll around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but  two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!!\n\ngo Romer's!","date":"2010-07-07 17:13:27"}

It seems to me Hometown has kicked the quality up a notch recently, making it an occasional go-to place when I'm in the mood for massive meat product.\n\nThere are several items I now like here.  The baked chicken is perfectly done, juicy, and covered with coarsely ground spices.  The pot roast is tender, flavorful and rich.  Delicious. \n\nSurprisingly the steak isn't bad, either.  You can get grilled sirloin every night, cooked to order.  Clearly the meat is injected for tenderness and flavor, but it always comes out hot and fresh with consistent texture.  I've had worse tasting and tougher at expensive steak places. \n\nAnother surprising item is the freshly sauteed green beans which are available only some of the time, with sauteed onions and whole strips of bacon. When those are gone, the cooks open a can of regular green beans that are unseasoned and boiled.  Not so good.\n\nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect for a food trough, compete with human visual appetite suppressants waddling around you.  It's enough for me to ratchet down the quantities I consume while still enjoying a few of the more quality items.\n\nDinner is $10.99 and it's worth adding a drink for $2.  Drink choices now include a guilty assortment of Icees with my favorite, cherry pomegranate.  It's surprisingly good for a childhood dessert beverage.\n\nIf you're in the mood to shovel decent meat in your face once in a while, give HomeTown Buffet a try again.

I decided on going to Bosphorous as our anniversary dinner restaurant, over Texas De Brazil while we were driving to Orlando from Ponce Inlet (1.5hr away, no ethnic, fine-dining restaurants here up to par).. Bosphorous was actually second on my list. They have a great website with a full menu (and good music to boot!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very elegant (as most Winter Park restaurants) and quite lonely on a Monday night (as most ethnic restaurants are in this area). We started our appetizers with the Turkish Ezme, which my husband nearly inhaled. It was described to us as Turkish salsa, and it was superb! So fresh! I am definitely looking that recipe up online. One thing to mention, you have to order the Lavas (Turkish large hollow bread) to eat with it. My opinon, have the bread come with the appetizer on the menu, versus ala carte. The bread was to die for, topped with melted butter and crisp sesame seeds. I barely got a handful of pieces, as my husband was wolfing that down, too!\n\nI loved the Turkish wine there, the winery brand is Yakut. Delicious, especially if you love a smooth, well-spiced but mellow red wine. After studying the menu, I decided to order the Yogurt Sis Kebap with rice instead of the buttered bread. My husband ordered the Turkish Pizza, him being a Pizza guy and all-around American that is just venturing into international cuisines. \n\nThe owner then came by our table and introduced himself. Then, he explained what type of dishes he enjoys and mentioned that the kitchen is all Turkish cooks. I was so excited. He even improvised our food order to make it extra special, and my lamb more crispy on the outside. That was unexpected and that service sets the bar above average! He then elaborated on the origins of the wine and let us enjoy our dinner as it was then served.\n\nI cannot describe how delicious the meal was. I moved here from Dallas, and all throughout Texas we have several Turkish restaurants, as well as so many other ethnicities. This was truly the best Turkish food I've had in my life and I am a Spaniard. \n\nWe finished the night off with a delicious cup of Turkish coffee, served the proper way on a Turkish serving tray!

They should take some cues from Disney on how to help guests see more attractions.\n\nThe scare zones did nothing for me. It was a bunch of high school kids and juggalos with crappy masks or makeup lunging at people. We couldn't tell who was part of the staff at times, because they barely had what you could consider a costume. Some of the scenes they had set up looked cool, though.

However, the staff is kinda rude. My party of 4, one of which was from out of town, showed up at 9:30 pm. We live in Milwaukie so it was kinda a trek to get there. This particular experience was the worst and embarrassing because I talked up the place to my out of town guest. As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving.  We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich?  The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. \nI am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out. The neighborhood was a buzz with people walking around. Other bars and restaurants were open and packed. I won't bother going back. I will take my business to Pix Patisserie.","date":"2014-10-11 12:23:31"}

We were not aware of what that really mean, and we saw that he added one more avocado to the mix of the guacamole. Later on, we found out that the one extra avocado indeed cost us the full amount of additional order of the guacamole. We were charged for two guacamole when we are getting an order of guacamole with an extra avocado in the same container. If we were told that the extra avocado would cost us $12.00, we would go ahead to placed two separate order of the guacamole instead. In that case, we are really getting two guacamoles, and not one guacamole with an extra avocado.\n\nWhen we compare out guacamole to the \"single\" order of guacamole at the table next to use, they both looked about the same.\n\nThere is no way that extra avocado should cost $12.00, I am perfectly OK if they charged $6.00 extra for each additional avocado, but adding just one more avocado to the existing order would turn it into a double order, that would be too much.","date":"2017-03-27 00:43:20"}

She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.

As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. \n\nShe later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.\n\nDinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else.

I imagine it must be pretty easy to find a good vet if you have an easy dog, but for owners like me with very particular pets, the demeanor and attitude of the staff is almost as important as their medical expertise, and the staff at Alpine is amazing. \n\nMy girl was rescued from dog fighting so she, understandably, has some quirks--she is extremely dog aggressive, is very uncomfortably with men, and is a mix of very strong and very tender. I was SO IMPRESSED with how the staff here treated us--I told the receptionist before we came in about her somewhat peculiar needs and they were more than accommodating. They made sure that only female members of the staff handled her and they made sure that she didn't interact with other animals, allowing us to wait in a separate room rather than the waiting room and shifting some things around in their treatment area so that she wouldn't have to be bandaged up near other pups. \n\nEveryone we interacted with was totally comfortable with her breed and her demeanor (they were incredibly understanding of her dog-aggression and there was absolutely no judgement of her as a bad dog or of me as a bad owner, which we've experienced with other places) and I would strongly recommend this place to other pit bull parents. \n\nI was really impressed with Dr. scwartzman--she was very gentle with my girl and did a wonderful job building a little bit of a relationship with her in the short time of our appointment, and she also took the time to explain the injury and treatment thoroughly to me and made sure to answer all of my questions.  \n\nThe vet techs were awesome as well--they gave my pup plenty of treats to help her feel more comfortable (they even used a frozen container of baby food to distract her, which I think is brilliant) and they did an excellent job with the bandages themselves. \n\nFinally, the front desk staff was spectacular--they were super nice and super helpful and they obviously care about the people and pets they get to interact with. \n\nI felt that the pricing here was very fair--I'm surprised to see so many other reviewers complaining about the cost. Also, for me, the fact that they required an exam before treating her injuries was a huge plus--I wouldn't feel comfortable having a vet prescribe treatment or medication without first examining my dog, and at least to me, it seems far less a scam to get money out of unsuspecting owners and far more a hallmark of a responsible and well run medical practice.","date":"2016-03-07 00:29:22"}

Got out for around $16.","date":"2014-04-01 03:43:56"}

My husband and I went today for lunch, only 2 other tables occupied. I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. So, while we were eating I wondered if we just got the wrong dishes since our experience was so different than the reviews on here. \n\nFirst I wanted guacamole, but no way was I going to pay $9 for it. So we passed. The online menu shows it is $3.50, but on the menu we only saw it for either $9 (or $10 if you wanted it made at your table). I did not see the offering for $3.50 on the menu. The menu they show online is not the same one we got in the restaurant. \n\nI had the enchiladas supreme, $9.75. It is 4 tiny enchiladas (one each of beef, chicken, bean and cheese), with a large pile of lettuce with a few tomatoes and a dollop of guacamole and a dollop of sour cream on top of them; this topping makes it look like a lot of food, when in reality it is not; no rice or beans come with this dish. I am very grateful that I asked for the mole sauce on the side as I did not like it at all. \n\nThe beef enchilada had beef with the consistency and taste of the beef from Taco Bell, only edible if you are starving. I have no idea what was up with the cheese enchilada, but whatever it was it didn't even look edible. It was a solid glob of yuck. The chicken enchilada and the bean enchilada were both okay, but nothing special. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas Verdes, two chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Again, the chicken enchiladas were okay. His enchiladas were also piled high with lettuce and the tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream making it look like more food than there actually was. His rice was not good and the beans were okay.\n\nThe free chips were okay, but thicker than I like. One of the salsas that came with the chips was pretty good, the other not so much, it had a bar-b-que taste to it. \n\nOur food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered it, which, to me, is an indication that it was not freshly made. More than likely it was already prepared, slapped on a plate and then microwaved for a couple of minutes. In hindsight, my husband thought the frozen chicken enchiladas from Amy's are better than the ones he had here. \n\nService was mediocre seeing how there was only 3 tables occupied. The guy was nice, chips and salsa arrive at the table practically before your tail hits the chair, which is great. The water took a long time to come and the check took a long time. After that our waiter disappeared and we ended up taking the check to some workers sitting at another table to ask to pay.\n\nThe food at Taqueria Del Sol and Bone Garden is much more to our liking and a lot different than the food at this place. So, maybe it is just not the style of Mexican food we like. \n\nWe will not be back.","date":"2016-10-13 20:36:16"}

The cafe is on the smaller side in terms of available seating, but the kitchen space is much bigger, as they not only serve bubble tea, but breakfast and snacks too. I didn't check out the food menu, but the drinks menu is quite extensive. \n\nI really liked that they offered two different sizes for the bubble tea. There are just some days where a full size is too much, but the smaller size (500mL at $3.50) was very reasonable, and still more than enough to get your fix. I'm a bubble tea purist at heart so I ordered the milk tea with pearls, half sweet. I loved it. The bubbles were soft and chewy, the perfect consistency. The milk tea was also nice and refreshing, and tasted like actual black tea rather than the powdery milk tea drinks I'm usually accustomed to. Although I had ordered it half sweet, it still had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I've had bubble teas in the past where my teeth literally ached from all the sugar, but this one was just right. They also have daily $2 specials which is practically unheard of in this day and age.

The plus is when one happens to magically choose the \"freshest\" items- they are actually pretty darn tasty, but then again the odds of getting this selection are always stacked against you with the myriad of choices that they offer daily.   I've had items ranging from an actual pie that when cut open on day one revealed a decidedly unpleasant blueish-purple mold, and another time a key lime pie slice had this particularly foul and perplexing  flavor(of perhaps a spoiled product) at the finish of each bite.   On the other hand, the lemon mousse cake, vibrant in decor is always amazingly good.  If one opts for the bakery case, pecan rolls, muffins,  and apple struedels always seem fresh and quite nicely prepared.   The growing selection of cupcakes well aesthetically pleasing, offer very little flavor that differs from say grabbing the yellow tub of sugar that is always waiting for you in your home pantry and diving in with a fav spoon.\n\nOur consensus vote is because they offer so many options, picking the best and freshest choices are nearly impossible statistically and  the bad experiences have been quite offensive lowlights, thereby dropping our rating from 3 to 2 stars overall.  There are much better reasonably close local options from Konditor to French Memories.","date":"2014-10-11 15:17:38"}

Speaking of IKEA, the join totally looks like it was furnished by the Swedish furniture giant.

They carry a TON of juices, but i found them to be of poorer quality than many other brands i have tried. The tasting bar is too small for the selection they have, and the pens for tasting are also of poorer quality than other places i went making it really difficult to really get a sense of what i was purchasing. \n\nAlso of concern is their liquids for tasting have nicotine, but no labels of which flavors have the nicotine in them and at what level, so you have no idea what level youre at when trying unless you ask an employee who has to recall from memory. I think its important for newbies to be aware of how the nicotone affects the juice\/throat hit but i think its more important that consumers know ahead of time what they are trying.\n\nI did settle on two flavors,  as i like to have a variety. One i have yet to bust into, but the other, a peanut butter  banana one that i was sooo excited to have found but was waaaay more intense when i put it in my emow at home than when i had it in the store- and not in a good way. It completely messed my palette up for a day and the resin really stuck in my tank even when i used a neutralizer\/rinse and changed the coil (ive tried several brands\/flavors and never had that issue). I literally disposed of the rest of the bottle because the thought of it now makes me physically ill.\n\nThe prices arent readily listed out which i find awkward and they were out of one flavor i really had wanted\/out of various nicotine levels in other flavors. While the sheer amount of options was impressive, and the service was pretty good, the options themselves werent high quality. I give this place an a-ok rating because of the service\/space itself (they have a good selection of equipment too) but i will stick to other vape shops going forward.","date":"2015-02-02 06:02:22"}

She actually said that. I'm no Yelp expert, but that seems like it should be against some guideline. If I hadn't been honest about my experience on here, my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog. \n\nWhen I reminded her about the 200% guarantee prominently displayed on their website, she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company. In other words, I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink. Still, I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company. And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was, but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls.\n\nThen, the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice. I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door (He was also upset also about my yelp review) was startling. He seemed to think the refund, while genuinely appreciated, would finish things, but they don't just advertise a refund, they say 200%, and my carpet was still stinking, so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was. While standing on my doorstep, he refused to come in and look at (or more importantly smell) the damaged carpet just a few feet away. \n\nWhen I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it, as the office manager suggested, he told me no, adding that if I had a problem with that answer, I could write about it on Yelp. Very clever, very unprofessional. But a helpful suggestion none the less. \n\nSo now I am. My experience indicated that Peace Frog's \"200% Peace of Mind Promise,\" if it actually exists, could use an Astrix by it saying something like *\"only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp.\" In the end, I was left worse off than when I started, having to fix a problem that didn't exist before they came to my house. The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced, quality work.","date":"2015-01-03 21:58:57"}

I understand an up-charge, but $1.50 for oil, dry spices, and sesame seeds?! and the waitress then said, \"so, if you want to pay for it...\" like she knew it was bullshit. Figure out a better way of telling the customer it's bullshit without making them feel like suckers for saying yes.  \n\nA lot of menu items have been taken off the list, a lot of the lamb is gone except for one entree, which wasn't that good.  There is a lot of beef, few chicken and one, maybe two lamb options. I also think they re-worked the mezza plates.  The falafel was really good and I would get that if nothing else, oh and a date soda. It's about $15 ahead. I hate the new menu with all the blown up pictures behind the food items, it's distracting.\n\nThey are opening up a bar on the second level, probably to accommodate the new apartment complex that's going in right across the street. I understand updating a menu and accommodating increasing food prices, but I think they are being a little greedy. I think they are hoping their reputation will keep people coming back no matter what they do.  Hopefully with the increase focus on a bar they will get a happy hour menu going which might entice me to come back, but until then I'll be getting falafel and gyros elsewhere.","date":"2014-08-10 22:54:57"}

The group stood at the hostess stand for about 15 minutes before being seated.  They were seated and sat for another 15 minutes and no one still had not served them. Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat.  This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today.  It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on.

Despite it being middle of the lunch hour the place was not packed, only two people in line in front of me.  The cashier was efficient though not very courteous.  I ordered the Classic 1\/3 pound Thick Burger (which similar to McDonalds' 1\/3 pounder is also made of Angus beef), small fries and a small drink.  I got a plastic number tag to place on my table.  \nThe washroom was not very dirty or stinky but it could have used a flush and a scrub.  My food arrived at my table after less than 5 minutes (it's nice that you don't have to wait by the cashier for your name or number to be called), but without my drink, so I had to go and get a cup from the cashier.  The tray was clean but it had a bump which made it wobbly. It was also a bit too small.  \nThe hamburger was in a paper wrapper inside a thick paper box.  The order of fries was of decent size even though it's called 'small'.  Each table has a napkin dispenser which is convenient.  \nThe burger was good size, fresh veggies and just a little bit too much sauce.  The patty was not too greasy although it could use a small boost of extra flavour or maybe some pickle slices.  The fries were nice, crispy outside and moist inside, and not too salty.  All in all  satisfying meal.  \nThe place looks like a typical fast food restaurant but it has a special plaque to commemorate its founder.  \nI did not see tables with dirty trays on them left uncleared.  \nThere is a long bar-like table at the street level floor plus tables for 2 and 4 people.  At the other floor there is another long table, tables for 2 people and 4 booth tables. \nThe front door is a bit heavy and difficult to open, and to get to the cashier you have to climb about 6-7 stairs.

They have a great selection of premium jeans as well as a lot of other \"teenager\/young adult premium wear\" and accessories. If you wear a standard size pant (waist size 28-40), this is a fantastic place to shop for jeans, as they carry a range of washes, fits, lengths, etc.. so you'll be able to find a few pairs that fit well and look great.\n\nThe quality of clothing is premium, but it's not crazy expensive either. I've had jeans from there last through beatings; only 1 pair has gotten a hole in it, and not a single torn seam. Most jeans are going to cost $70-80, but there will be a few that may cost more. They're definitely a good value if you're looking for a premium quality clothing product without spending a fortune. \n\nAlthough their clothes are good quality, their accessories such as necklaces and bracelets aren't quite as high quality. I've had these break on me after only a few times out with them, and you can tell just by looking at them that they're pretty frail.\n\nAs far as customer service\/experience, I went in today, and I have been to the buckle stores a few times. I was greeted when I walked in, and everything was neat and orderly. A young lady name Kat (or Cat) asked if she could help me find anything, and what I was shopping for.\n\nWe quickly picked out a few different fits, and from there figured out what washes I preferred. I only had to go into the dressing room once, and Kat even found a few similar styles and sizes for me to try on while I was in there to make sure I was getting the best fit and look I possibly could without having to go back and forth from the dressing room. As a guy.. none of us want to spend a ton of time shopping for jeans, its a nightmare honestly, but Kat made it easy!\n\nI also will admit that I don't know a tremendous amount about jeans, but Kat also was on the spot here, telling me about the difference between \"rise\", \"fit\", \"leg opening\", and material, and how this affects the fit and look when they're worn. She even showed me a few different washes in the size\/styles I liked that we could order online and have shipped to the store or to my house.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, and I appreciate people like Kat that take a great product carried by the store, and make it an easy and pleasurable experience to find, learn about,  and purchase the perfect clothing for the look you want.","date":"2016-09-06 02:18:00"}

Everything that I have had thus far has been absolutely delicious.  Last time we went we got the appetizer special, which was escargot in jalapeno butter with crostinis.  Those of you who will not dare to try escargot do not know what you are missing.  I am pretty sure my eyes were closed most of the time taking in all of those     flavors and textures the dish had to offer.  For entrees, we ordered the trout almondine  served with lump crab meat and toasted almonds, and the five spice crusted pork tenderloin (my new favorite).  Both dishes were excellent.  The rainbow trout had a nice pan-seared outside and a flaky inside.  The chipotle lime brown butter complimented the fish nicely.  The pork tenderloin stuffed with blue corn chorizo was well prepared and full of flavors.  The ranchero burgundy sauce that it comes with is spicy and delicious.  The tenderloin is served with potato enchiladas to settle down the heat from the sauce, and fresh vegetables that not only added more textures to the dish but beautiful colors as well.  One of the best dishes I have had in a while.  We finished dinner with a coffee (medium house blend)  that hit the spot.  Props to our waiter Tim for adding so much to that evening's dining experience.  \n\nThe previous time we ordered the jalapeno venison meatloaf with charred poblano demi-glace on a bed of roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!  All of the components of the dish came together in perfect harmony.  I just wished it was bigger.  The country snapper was also very good, particularly its light panko crust and the guajillo mashed potatoes that it came with.  \n\nWhenever I thought South Congress could not top itself, I got the dried cherry and pecan  bread pudding with bourbon sauce.  That dessert deserved a moment of silent.  For those of you who are familiar with my reviews 1) I LOVE bread pudding and will go to places to grade theirs, and 2) I do not like it with ice cream.  So in this case, Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream was nowhere in sight.  Even before I tasted it, the aromas of the bourbon and cinnamon were intoxicating me with joy and delight.  As my fork gently cut through the pudding I could see a bit of steam emerging from its warm center.  I think it might have spelled the word \"bliss\".  The cherries were not tart as I had feared.  The pecans were not overwhelming and only emerged in a minuscule way to add a slight crunch to the perfectly-sweetened homemade bread.  \n\nIt was simply perfect.","date":"2009-08-04 03:10:37"}

Despite the fact that it's not my go-to place, whenever I have visitors from out of town, they LOVE it there and I like having it in my back-pocket.\n3. Their Eggplant parm is to DIE for. For reals. Amazingly mild and flavorful eggplant, not bitter at all, and their tomato sauce mixed with their cream sauce. Oh. My. Goodness.\n4. Their side salad is delish - a great mix of greens, other veggies, and some spicy peppers that aren't too spicy. I don't even put dressing on it.\n5. Love sitting on their patio in the summer and then going to see a movie. Such a relaxing date.\n6. Took my mom there for Christmas Eve last year (get a reservation!) and we had a two hour meal. It was grand and the service was fabulous.\n\nNow, the meh:\n1. In the winter, when you can't sit outside, it's a bit crowded, dim, and loud. This is a common theme in my reviews. I'm not a fan of crowded loud places. If you are, then disregard this. Honestly, it's not that bad, I just struggle to filter out background noise.\n2. I can't drink wine and their cocktails are good but not great\n3. Menu is good, and nothing on it is less than good. Things are prepared just so, and lots of fresh ingredients. But the menu has been basically the same for three years and nothing on it (except the eggplant parm! See above) is so amazing as to eclipse other places rendition or so creative as to cause one to think, \"I have to go there again soon!\"\n4. It is pricey.

Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints.\n\nSo I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are.\n\nI called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate.\n\nI decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes.\n\nYou get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.)\n\nOn moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took  a walk-through of the house.  Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away.\n\nAnd they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy.\n\nThey took less than 2 1\/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved.\n\nAt the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. \n\nThese guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga.\n\nIt was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end.\n\nThis move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end.\n\nI could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.","date":"2011-02-13 15:54:17"}

That raised my concerns about the place. However, have been here twice now and ordered their dosas on both occasions. The dosa was gr8, crispy with 2 kinds of chutney and a spicy sambhar. The potato mash stuffing inside the dosa was so spicy the first time around that my toddler was red in the face. The owner was generous enough to offer complimentary Gulab Jamun to calm the heat :) The jamuns were perfectly soft centered making them melt in the mouth. My husband had a to go order of Biryani on both counts, the quantity is for 2 servings but its still over priced. We tried the chicken chettinadu with nan. The Chettinadu was awesome with nicely balanced flavours, no over powering spices. The service can be be slow on weekends and be prepared to wait 45mins before your order arrives.\nOver all...gr8ly satisfied.","date":"2014-02-23 22:28:25"}

It was New Year's Day and we found ourselves wandering aimlessly around Austin very famished. Luckily good ol' Zen was open!\n\nSo this location looks like it could be featured in a Dwell Magazine article. Kudos on the design! Love the modern wall art, hanging light fixtures and wooden beams. I felt properly hipster in there.\n\nOur food was good- like it normally is since they've done the menu makeover- but I don't know if it was because it was a holiday or what, but the staff kind of made me feel guilty for ordering sushi when their wasn't any made. Twice! If that is your trick to get me to tip more, you did an excellent job, sirs!\n\nAlso, the cashier was playing around with his smartphone while it was somewhat busy.

Based on the name and how the lady described it, it sounded like a chocolate lovers dream. It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all.  If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving.  The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :\/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.","date":"2017-02-09 09:12:49"}
