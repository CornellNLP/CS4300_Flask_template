On a winter's day, while about to drown, he discovers he can transport himself instantaneously to anyplace on earth. He runs away from home, goes to New York City, robs a bank vault, and comes to the attention of a shadowy group of government hunters. Eight years later, the hunters, led by the murderous Roland, get a fix on David. He heads home, searches out Millie, invites her to travel with him, and only later realizes that Roland and his crew are seriously deadly. Is everyone close to David in danger?","tokens":["shy","teen","david","rice","max","theriot","crush","pretti","milli","annasophia","robb","dream","travel","world","when","surpris","small","gift","snow","globe","eiffel","tower","teas","bulli","mark","jess","jame","grab","throw","onto","ici","surfac","river","determin","david","ventur","ic","retriev","wave","fall","ic","swept","awai","open","swift","current","he","certain","die","freez","water","without","air","suddenli","find","ly","prone","librari","bookcas","huge","gush","gallon","water","gasp","aliv","he","trudg","home","soak","wet","father","michael","rooker","chew","david","enter","room","put","chain","door","angri","father","burst","open","swirl","wind","david","vanish","he","find","damp","aisl","darken","librari","realis","teleport","yet","it","dawn","final","wai","chang","life","escap","situat","wai","mother","abandon","famili","five","he","teleport","home","retriev","small","stash","monei","belong","but","leav","town","stop","outsid","milli","hous","milli","consol","mother","arm","sure","david","dead","she","hear","nois","outsid","step","cautious","yard","find","snowglob","sit","swingset","from","know","aliv","respond","call","the","next","dai","bu","citi","rent","cheap","room","he","practic","teleport","park","learn","control","power","then","case","bank","rob","teleport","directli","vault","middl","night","he","laugh","realis","bag","big","enough","take","awai","monei","teleport","back","shabbi","hotel","anoth","bag","repeat","room","awash","monei","li","bed","howev","mysteri","roland","samuel","l","jackson","appear","bank","investig","claim","nsa","remark","unsurpris","lock","door","robberi","it","evid","know","teleport","abil","part","power","group","want","find","bank","robber","year","gone","david","hayden","christenson","expens","citi","apart","paper","pictur","world","travel","small","vault","room","full","monei","he","enjoi","pleasur","life","wherev","surf","fiji","lunch","atop","sphinx","egypt","pick","girl","british","pub","he","phase","on","spot","anoth","home","rather","walk","even","two","pace","disregard","troubl","ordinari","peopl","shown","televis","trap","rise","floodwat","hi","peac","disturb","arriv","roland","whose","electr","weapon","wire","prevent","david","teleport","we","learn","roland","mission","life","destroi","jumper","peopl","teleport","god","power","everywher","desper","david","manag","somehow","get","awai","teleport","back","boyhood","bedroom","hi","father","alert","presenc","come","bedroom","door","beg","stai","david","teleport","awai","father","forc","door","open","hi","idyl","lifestyl","disrupt","decid","see","lost","love","milli","rachel","bilson","he","find","still","town","work","bar","hi","old","nemesi","mark","teddi","dunn","manag","start","fight","rush","david","teleport","bank","vault","leav","return","bar","ask","milli","go","rome","she","shock","lifelong","dream","accept","when","get","rome","enjoi","delight","show","around","ancient","citi","balk","find","coliseum","close","rather","take","answer","return","anoth","dai","goe","around","corner","catch","hold","gate","open","admit","he","continu","open","door","insid","pursu","privat","tour","try","go","floor","stadium","suddenli","surpris","meet","anoth","jumper","griffin","jami","bell","inform","on","whole","group","peopl","like","roland","paladin","want","kill","jumper","two","suddenli","turn","griffin","prepar","fight","method","eventu","subdu","attack","teleport","awai","david","follow","griffin","teleport","lair","ask","question","he","bewild","griffin","brief","explan","explain","drop","paladin","shark","noth","enlighten","griffin","explain","david","cannot","afford","girlfriend","famili","friend","dead","paladin","kill","get","david","return","milli","agre","leav","get","awai","offici","insid","coliseum","detain","outsid","david","jump","tell","milli","go","back","hotel","refus","hour","later","david","still","question","polic","hold","passport","author","arriv","suddenli","woman","dian","lane","appear","tell","get","abandon","girl","tell","mani","minut","escap","he","recognis","childhood","pictur","mother","he","find","milli","take","airport","explain","sorrowfulli","cannot","go","back","home","in","meantim","roland","brought","talk","mark","david","left","bank","vault","mark","exhaust","repeatedli","tell","stori","disbeliev","offici","explain","david","everyth","know","seiz","opportun","roland","visit","david","father","david","return","ask","griffin","question","time","risk","famili","sink","he","teleport","childhood","home","find","father","floor","cry","teleport","father","hospit","emerg","room","try","get","help","he","teleport","see","mark","jail","ask","told","roland","mark","sai","told","everyth","david","realis","milli","danger","soon","get","plane","usa","ask","griffin","help","griffin","refus","david","follow","griffin","jump","try","convinc","griffin","swipe","car","ride","togeth","griffin","teleport","car","traffic","suit","thei","exchang","bit","inform","paladin","
