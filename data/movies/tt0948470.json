Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.","tokens":["scientist","richard","parker","campbel","scott","plai","hide","seek","young","son","peter","max","charl","discov","studi","broken","after","quickli","gather","hidden","document","richard","wife","mari","embeth","davidtz","leav","peter","aunt","mai","salli","field","uncl","ben","martin","sheen","mysteri","depart","without","tell","peter","go","year","later","teenag","peter","parker","andrew","garfield","becom","alien","social","outcast","he","attend","midtown","scienc","high","school","pine","crush","gwen","staci","emma","stone","frequent","get","bulli","obnoxi","flash","thompson","chri","zylka","at","home","peter","find","briefcas","contain","father","old","document","learn","father","work","fellow","scientist","dr","curti","connor","rhy","ifan","pharmaceut","compani","name","oscorp","fake","wai","oscorp","build","pretend","intern","peter","sneak","laboratori","extrem","strong","biocabl","creat","genet","modifi","spider","on","spider","escap","contain","bite","peter","on","subwai","ride","home","peter","scuffl","gang","thug","discov","suddenli","increas","agil","strength","upon","return","home","find","spider","hide","jacket","store","awai","the","next","dai","peter","goe","dr","connor","hous","give","richard","parker","document","dr","connor","explain","richard","research","cross","speci","genet","order","find","wai","grow","lost","limb","dr","connor","motiv","loss","right","arm","dr","connor","frustrat","superior","dr","rajit","ratha","irrfan","khan","pressur","devis","cure","oscorp","ceo","norman","osborn","termin","ill","back","school","peter","get","troubl","accident","break","basketbal","hoop","game","flash","uncl","ben","forc","switch","work","shift","meet","princip","situat","afterward","uncl","ben","ask","peter","pick","aunt","mai","peter","instead","practic","new","found","power","meet","dr","connor","oscorp","show","limb","regener","formula","work","laboratori","mous","when","peter","return","home","uncl","ben","scold","forgotten","pick","aunt","mai","remind","richard","believ","peopl","alwai","make","respons","prioriti","a","distraught","peter","storm","he","goe","store","bui","milk","fall","two","cent","cent","short","refus","servic","store","clerk","suddenli","man","rob","store","peter","anyth","stop","uncl","ben","search","peter","see","thief","run","awai","wrestl","gun","the","thief","shoot","uncl","ben","right","front","peter","run","shortli","attack","peter","acquir","polic","sketch","killer","us","abil","hunt","crimin","match","killer","descript","after","attack","man","fit","descript","chase","gang","fall","insid","abandon","gym","luchador","wrestl","poster","inspir","creat","mask","later","add","spandex","suit","mobil","suddenli","becom","folk","hero","public","refer","spider","man","the","polic","led","gwen","father","captain","georg","staci","deni","leari","soon","start","man","hunt","mask","vigilant","meanwhil","dr","ratha","fire","dr","connor","refus","immedi","start","human","trial","limb","regener","formula","he","take","sampl","drug","plan","test","veteran","administr","hospit","guis","flu","shot","grow","desper","dr","connor","inject","formula","pass","upon","awaken","find","lost","arm","fulli","regener","howev","mutat","larg","reptilian","monster","chase","dr","ratha","williamsburg","bridg","throw","car","side","rampag","spider","man","save","fallen","car","biocabl","web","deploi","wrist","mount","shooter","invent","with","great","deal","difficulti","also","manag","save","life","young","boi","trap","car","fallen","bridg","spider","man","hold","suspend","midair","biocabl","web","spider","man","confront","lizard","sewer","bare","escap","aliv","unfortun","peter","leav","behind","camera","us","expos","lizard","intent","camera","inscrib","name","the","lizard","find","learn","spider","man","real","ident","he","attack","peter","school","plan","unleash","drug","manhattan","mutat","human","lizard","us","cloud","gener","devic","oscorp","tower","unawar","gwen","make","antidot","condit","peter","request","the","polic","mobil","stop","spider","man","delai","lizard","infect","offic","small","dose","chemic","captain","staci","learn","spider","man","real","ident","allow","go","stop","connor","proceed","tower","peter","mention","gwen","make","antidot","howev","manhunt","spider","man","wound","polic","bullet","difficulti","swing","build","build","reach","oscorp","tower","the","father","young","boi","whose","life","spider","man","save","work","construct","hear","go","radio","tv","work","even","shift","he","call","construct","worker","friend","also","work","maneuv","larg","crane","proper","format","spider","man","us","reach","oscorp","tower","after","captain","staci","retriev","antidot","gwen","arriv","save","spider","man","overpow","fight","togeth","delai","lizard","spider","man","modifi","machin","dispers","antidot","instead","restor","human","connor","infect","offic","allow","save","peter","fatal","fall","tower","unfortun","lizard","mortal","wound","captain","staci","befor","d
