Formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent, Two-Face incorrectly believes Batman caused the courtroom accident which left him disfigured on one side; he has unleashed a reign of terror on the good people of Gotham. Edward Nygma, computer-genius and former employee of millionaire Bruce Wayne, is out to get the philanthropist; as The Riddler he perfects a device for draining information from all the brains in Gotham, including Bruce Wayne's knowledge of his other identity. Batman/Wayne is/are the love focus of Dr. Chase Meridan. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner Robin the Boy Wonder.","tokens":["the","legendari","dark","knight","batman","person","demon","face","insan","villain","seek","destroi","gotham","but","batman","grow","tire","nightli","parad","batman","daili","exist","rich","power","bruce","wayn","he","haunt","memori","parent","death","begin","rememb","detail","two","face","psycho","killer","blame","batman","scar","split","face","team","the","riddler","ex","employe","bruce","wayn","enterpris","refus","partnership","wayn","invent","danger","bruce/","batman","thrown","contact","beauti","dr","chase","meridian","gotham","review","case","two","face","a","romanc","develop","two","chase","desir","bruce","batman","unawar","person","bruce","desir","chase","anyon","know","understand","human","mind","better","anyon","els","he","ask","chariti","circu","invit","elit","gotham","but","event","crash","two","face","thug","also","decid","attend","uninvit","a","famili","acrobat","kill","two","face","leav","youngest","son","dick","robin","grayson","aliv","thirst","reveng","two","face","taken","wayn","soon","discov","bruce","carefulli","hidden","alter","ego","batman","take","batmobil","spin","interrupt","date","chase","bruce","he","beg","bruce","allow","partner","final","return","bat","cave","alfr","elderli","butler","refus","spurn","dick","need","reveng","tell","bruce","like","meanwhil","entrepreneur","call","edward","nygma","actual","two","face","new","accomplic","the","riddler","grow","rich","power","famou","invent","new","3","d","wai","watch","t","v","but","fact","suck","secret","citizen","gotham","grow","extrem","intellig","he","gun","bruce","well","batman","discov","person","soon","two","villain","newli","form","partnership","batman","robin","when","chase","kidnap","evil","pair","batman","robin","go","the","riddler","two","face","hideout","metal","fabric","artifici","island","alfr","bruce","manag","crack","riddl","the","riddler","leav","discov","edward","nygma","green","clad","villain","in","end","batman","face","decis","save","either","chase","robin","jag","rock","pit","suspend","the","riddler","he","trick","the","riddler","howev","break","giant","hourglass","structur","contain","store","brainwav","citizen","gotham","he","save","chase","robin","us","two","face","coin","kill","madman","throw","multitud","coin","instead","two","face","special","on","robin","understand","better","kill","two","face","agre","bruce","crime","far","much","bear","at","end","edward","claim","batman","flap","sleev","straight","jacket","grotesqu","imit","bat","wing","cackl","chase","make","wai","back","outsid","lunat","asylum","inform","bruce","on","ever","know","batman","she","leav","gotham","never","see","secret","shadow","destin","hero","ever","batman","robin","partner","dark","knight","inde","alwai","go","protector","gothic","metropoli","gotham"],"tmdb_score_value":5.2,"tmdb_score_count":1962,"imdb_score_value":5.4,"imdb_score_count":209559,"meta_score_value":51.0,"meta_score_count":209559}
