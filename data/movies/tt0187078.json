He gets dragged back into it by assuming the job his brother Kip screwed up for stolen-car broker Raymond Calitri: steal 50 exotic cars and have them on a container ship by 8 AM Friday morning, and he got this news on a Monday. With Calitri threatening to kill him and Kip, and the police GRAB unit breathing down his neck, Memphis reassembles his old crew and attempts to pull off the logistically impossible.","tokens":["nicola","cage","face/off","the","rock","angelina","joli","lara","croft","tomb","raider","want","vinni","jone","snatch","the","condemn","team","bring","gone","in","60","second","action","pack","heist","caper","combin","hi","tech","action","refresh","comedi","never","let","minut","legendari","car","booster","randal","memphi","rain","nicola","cage","thought","left","fast","lane","behind","forc","retir","die","effort","save","kid","brother","giovanni","ribisi","lost","in","translat","tv","friend","wrath","evil","mobster","but","speed","burn","attitud","spare","memphi","hastili","reassembl","old","crew","rogu","galleri","includ","academi","award","winner","robert","duval","1983","best","actor","tender","merci","open","rang","floor","full","throttl","race","pull","ulim","car","heist","50","exot","beauti","24","hour","cop","alreadi","direct","domin","sena","written","scott","rosenberg","featur","great","soundtrack","gone","in","60","second","action","pack","thrill","ride","come","fast","never","slow","ic","cold","hot","wire"],"tmdb_score_value":6.1,"tmdb_score_count":1802,"imdb_score_value":6.5,"imdb_score_count":235927,"meta_score_value":35.0,"meta_score_count":235927}
