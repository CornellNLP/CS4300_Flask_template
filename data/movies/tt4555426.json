But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with the German dictator or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Churchill has no choice, but to shine in his darkest hour.","tokens":["in","mai","1940","million","german","troop","belgian","border","intent","conquer","rest","europ","in","britain","parliament","lost","faith","current","prime","minist","nevil","chamberlain","ronald","pickup","alreadi","look","find","replac","everi","member","parliament","clamor","anger","chamberlain","appar","inabl","lead","world","war","ii","alreadi","begun","cite","incompet","what","want","leader","form","coalit","parti","dure","dinner","men","gather","favor","foreign","secretari","lord","halifax","stephen","dillan","new","prime","minist","halifax","grate","consider","claim","time","yet","come","chamberlain","state","on","man","accept","nobodi","els","pleas","thought","elizabeth","layton","lili","jame","begin","first","dai","work","secretari","winston","churchil","gari","oldman","as","enter","room","churchil","order","elizabeth","start","type","telegram","french","ambassador","he","receiv","phone","call","ambassador","inform","churchil","german","troop","alreadi","invad","holland","belgium","churchil","tell","elizabeth","start","new","telegram","gener","hast","ismai","richard","lumsden","light","recent","new","churchil","becom","critic","elizabeth","work","wherein","proce","yell","insult","drive","room","tear","elizabeth","run","churchil","wife","clementin","kristin","scott","thoma","awar","happen","she","goe","bedroom","tell","husband","becom","rude","overbear","would","like","other","love","respect","wai","churchil","receiv","offici","telegram","king","georg","vi","ben","mendelsohn","invit","meet","buckingham","palac","georg","chamberlain","meet","prior","churchil","arriv","georg","lack","enthusiasm","pick","churchil","chamberlain","sai","churchil","on","full","support","opposit","onc","churchil","get","georg","offici","offer","posit","prime","minist","churchil","begin","term","prime","minist","address","member","parliament","in","speech","tell","men","alreadi","begun","form","coalit","plan","wage","war","enemi","ensur","victori","cost","mean","necessari","counter","previou","discuss","peac","talk","germani","the","men","visibl","confid","lord","halifax","sit","chamberlain","outsid","churchil","speech","halifax","express","doubt","churchil","capabl","leader","chamberlain","tell","halifax","cancer","fear","mai","live","see","countri","peac","halifax","come","plan","try","get","churchil","try","vote","confid","chamberlain","polici","mai","reinstat","chamberlain","sai","must","get","written","agreement","churchil","state","agre","peac","talk","churchil","inform","300","000","british","troop","strand","beach","dunkirk","the","concern","send","troop","rescu","strand","churchil","want","keep","new","public","concern","keep","franc","safe","churchil","frequent","critic","member","parliament","halifax","meet","king","georg","person","discuss","remov","churchil","posit","churchil","address","nation","radio","try","assur","peopl","conquer","enemi","howev","return","home","tell","clementin","li","basic","full","retreat","clementin","defend","action","sai","would","done","good","put","fear","everyon","thought","churchil","photograph","make","backward","v","sign","think","mean","victori","elizabeth","inform","part","countri","wai","mean","bum","the","two","share","hearti","laugh","over","matter","troop","dunkirk","report","british","troop","strand","after","inform","nearbi","garrison","churchil","opt","send","4","000","men","rescu","300","000","the","member","think","suicid","mission","churchil","assert","posit","want","go","evacu","plan","churchil","later","call","presid","franklin","roosevelt","ask","u","s","mai","send","50","40","destroy","help","new","law","prohibit","roosevelt","allow","churchil","contact","admir","bertram","ramsai","allow","mani","boat","possibl","sent","evacu","thi","would","known","oper","dynamo","dure","anoth","meet","lord","subject","peac","talk","brought","churchil","argu","fierc","halifax","oppos","view","handl","ongo","war","halifax","give","churchil","24","hour","negoti","peac","talk","resign","churchil","elizabeth","write","telegram","confirm","evacu","take","place","visibl","distress","she","ask","mani","men","mai","surviv","churchil","walk","map","illustr","sever","situat","churchil","inform","belgium","surrend","franc","set","follow","suit","churchil","colleagu","urg","prepar","possibl","immin","invas","island","it","state","itali","will","mediat","peac","talk","britain","alli","germani","back","corner","churchil","choic","agre","consid","peac","talk","hitler","long","allow","britain","maintain","independ","elizabeth","type","anoth","telegram","churchil","stop","understand","due","constant","mumbl","churchil","notic","elizabeth","photo","man","sai","brother","she","tell","churchil","fall","back","dunkirk","make","he","understand","earlier","distress","dunkirk","situat","king","georg","visit","churchil","mussolini","desir","barter","hitler","georg","express","support","churchil","sai","mani","dread","appoint","prime","minist","none","afraid","hitler","believ","churc
