Thirty years later, they gather with their families for their coach's funeral and a weekend at a house on a lake where they used to party. By now, each is a grownup with problems and challenges: Marcus is alone and drinks too much. Rob, with three daughters he rarely sees, is always deeply in love until he turns on his next ex-wife. Eric is overweight and out of work. Kurt is a househusband, henpecked by wife and mother-in-law. Lenny is a successful Hollywood agent married to a fashion designer; their kids take privilege for granted. Can the outdoors help these grownups rediscover connections or is this chaos in the making?","tokens":["in","1978","five","friend","win","junior","high","basketbal","championship","dure","celebr","coach","buzzer","blake","clark","encourag","live","live","similar","wai","plai","game","30","year","later","five","friend","sinc","separ","lenni","feder","adam","sandler","high","power","hollywood","talent","agent","marri","roxann","salma","hayek","fashion","design","togeth","two","son","greg","keith","on","daughter","becki","becom","spoil","much","lenni","annoy","eric","lamonsoff","kevin","jame","co","owner","lawn","furnitur","compani","sai","impress","friend","marri","salli","maria","bello","togeth","on","daughter","donna","on","son","bean","still","breastfe","despit","four","year","old","much","eric","chagrin","kurt","mckenzi","chri","rock","stai","home","father","marri","deann","maya","rudolph","primari","breadwinn","famili","togeth","son","andr","daughter","charlott","deann","pregnant","third","child","mother","ronzoni","live","well","all","harass","kurt","us","rob","hilliard","rob","schneider","thrice","divorc","pacifist","vegan","marri","gloria","joyc","van","patten","30","year","older","marcu","higgin","david","spade","becom","singl","woman","when","learn","coach","di","return","new","england","famili","funer","lenni","rent","lake","hous","4th","juli","weekend","friend","stai","lenni","stai","whole","weekend","roxann","fashion","show","milan","while","lake","hous","lenni","annoi","kid","would","rather","plai","video","game","spend","time","outdoor","other","forc","kid","spend","time","outsid","hous","at","local","restaur","lenni","run","old","nemesi","dicki","bailei","colin","quinn","work","cook","dicki","still","upset","lenni","allegedli","foot","bound","made","long","ago","game","win","shot","challeng","friend","rematch","lenni","declin","declar","wast","time","dure","dinner","group","discuss","spread","coach","ash","morn","lenni","sai","roxann","fashion","show","roxann","angrili","storm","lenni","paint","neg","she","allow","spread","ash","demand","leav","earli","follow","morn","in","morn","five","gui","row","island","spread","ash","when","rob","spread","ash","break","tell","gui","screw","previou","marriag","nervou","meet","daughter","come","when","get","back","hous","final","meet","rob","daughter","two","jasmin","amber","seem","gorgeou","rob","on","bridget","close","resembl","to","calm","nerv","five","gui","plai","game","call","arrow","roulett","arrow","shot","air","last","person","run","awai","win","rob","win","arrow","land","foot","that","even","roxann","pack","becki","tooth","fall","roxann","busi","notic","tell","put","dollar","pillow","later","when","becki","ask","would","instead","tooth","fairi","roxann","tell","lenni","worri","ruin","becki","childhood","when","lenni","hear","kid","supposedli","talk","cellphon","come","bedroom","find","actual","talk","cup","phone","kid","happi","kid","start","kind","fun","ag","ask","everyon","instal","cup","phone","around","hous","roxann","tell","becki","cup","phone","truth","tooth","fairi","in","morn","pack","car","roxann","see","kid","fun","lake","decid","leav","lake","hous","happi","wife","new","attitud","lenni","decid","head","waterpark","dai","there","bean","learn","drink","milk","carton","marcu","flirt","constantli","jasmin","amber","much","rob","dismai","the","group","run","dicki","time","on","friend","wilei","steve","buscemi","end","hospit","zip","line","accid","back","hous","deann","becom","suspici","kurt","see","spend","time","rita","lenni","nanni","that","even","adult","spend","time","togeth","drink","danc","reminisc","past","in","morn","rob","suspect","marcu","sex","either","jasmin","amber","confront","jasmin","amber","assur","marcu","assur","never","would","roxann","confront","lenni","fact","cancel","milan","plane","reserv","funer","behind","back","lenni","claim","felt","time","lake","hous","necessari","kid","becom","spoil","unsur","roxann","would","go","along","he","tell","lie","deann","confront","kurt","supposedli","flirt","rita","kurt","assur","flirt","enjoi","actual","convers","feel","like","get","deann","deann","offer","take","date","eric","admit","group","co","owner","lawn","furnitur","compani","laid","two","month","ago","he","want","everyon","think","failur","lenni","resolv","offer","eric","invest","opportun","gloria","tell","everyon","despit","recent","hostil","sens","love","everyon","the","group","head","4th","juli","barbecu","challeng","dicki","friend","rematch","basketbal","game","wilei","massiv","bodi","cast","escap","intens","care","watch","rob","suggest","coach","would","want","take","challeng","despit","everyon","shape","rob","injuri","agre","game","the","game","close","player","get","tire","continu","leav","lenni","dicki","court","thei","bring","son","continu","plai","when","lenni","chanc","make","game","win","shot","deliber","miss","allow","dicki","win","give","sens","victori","lenni","other","take","loss","stride","while","watch","firework","drunken","marcu","decid","plai","anoth","game","arrow","roulett","caus","eve
