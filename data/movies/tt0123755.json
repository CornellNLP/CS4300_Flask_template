Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math whiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.","tokens":["the","film","open","man","alderson","julian","rich","wake","cube","shape","room","glow","comput","circuit","like","wall","six","door","on","center","wall","ceil","floor","after","recov","confus","open","two","door","look","find","room","differ","on","color","he","open","goe","third","door","he","look","around","take","step","suddenli","cut","larg","squar","shape","piec","he","fall","apart","rack","crosshatch","wire","dice","move","view","it","fold","retract","later","anoth","room","sever","peopl","find","quentin","mauric","dean","wint","worth","david","hewlett","hollowai","nicki","guadagni","renn","wayn","robson","leaven","nicol","de","boer","none","know","got","quentin","howev","know","trap","look","room","nearli","got","head","cut","the","five","decid","stai","togeth","look","wai","renn","take","lead","he","exemplifi","test","trap","toss","boot","room","hold","onto","lace","trigger","potenti","trap","figur","trap","room","contain","motion","detector","hollowai","specul","sever","possibl","creator","cube","alien","govern","main","option","renn","remark","stai","still","solv","anyth","sai","move","straight","line","get","end","the","other","agre","begin","move","room","while","move","discov","seri","differ","number","hatchwai","room","at","on","point","renn","throw","boot","find","anyth","detect","room","dry","air","deduc","like","emploi","electrochem","sensor","detect","hydrogen","sulfid","emit","skin","quentin","realiz","renn","escap","artist","escap","seven","major","prison","soon","renn","jump","room","test","boot","sprai","face","acid","the","other","pull","back","di","acid","corrod","face","insid","head","the","group","decid","room","must","contain","electrochem","sensor","renn","miss","realiz","must","find","better","wai","test","room","quentin","ask","everyon","occup","he","sai","polic","offic","hollowai","sai","doctor","worth","sai","work","offic","build","offic","build","stuff","leaven","claim","simpli","hang","friend","quentin","believ","noth","coincid","purpos","cube","after","hollowai","talk","ring","broach","quentin","ask","leaven","glass","hollowai","jewelri","taken","awai","leaven","reveal","excel","mathemat","look","number","crawlspac","theoriz","on","number","prime","room","boobi","trap","leaven","purpos","becom","attempt","crack","cube","code","progress","cube","when","find","room","trap","room","around","quentin","check","door","ceil","fall","seventh","person","kazan","andrew","miller","he","appear","mental","handicap","at","least","two","other","see","burden","hollowai","decid","bring","along","the","group","start","specul","surround","caus","conflict","quentin","hollowai","quentin","dismiss","hollowai","idea","conspiraci","theori","hollowai","think","quentin","naiv","soon","quentin","enter","room","without","prime","number","narrowli","avoid","death","trap","consist","rotat","razor","wire","leaven","theori","non","prime","number","room","safe","shown","incorrect","quentin","begin","suspect","worth","spy","increasingli","irrit","kazan","mental","state","the","group","rest","leaven","attempt","deciph","number","after","time","quentin","trick","worth","reveal","on","architect","design","enorm","cube","shape","shell","contain","cube","shape","room","when","ask","contract","job","state","know","although","other","begin","distrust","worth","quentin","go","far","beat","abl","give","inform","dimens","outer","cube","434","feet","26","room","side","total","17","576","room","leaven","intuit","number","room","could","encod","cartesian","coordin","repres","posit","room","within","cube","the","group","begin","move","toward","nearest","edg","as","trap","begin","boot","room","the","group","forc","pass","room","contain","sound","activ","trap","quentin","argu","leav","kazan","behind","hollowai","overrul","everyon","make","quentin","turn","kazan","call","nearli","caus","death","quentin","furiou","nearli","beat","hollowai","stop","turn","argu","heatedli","end","quentin","slap","despit","grow","tension","continu","the","group","final","reach","on","side","edg","cube","discov","gap","door","outer","shell","thei","fashion","rope","cloth","hollowai","volunt","swing","rope","investig","as","suspend","outsid","room","cube","shake","hollowai","nearli","fall","quentin","catch","let","fall","death","he","tell","other","slip","dubiou","the","group","decid","try","reach","bottom","edg","cube","agre","need","rest","set","as","sleep","quentin","carri","leaven","anoth","room","he","tri","convinc","leaven","abandon","other","make","sexual","advanc","becom","abus","obviou","dislik","worth","kazan","awaken","save","leaven","quentin","becom","paranoid","sai","trust","hollowai","rest","group","guess","let","die","enrag","quentin","beat","throw","worth","door","floor","worth","laugh","hyster","see","room","renn","corps","thei","think","go","circl","worth","notic","acid","room","kill","renn","longer","adjac","room","he","leaven","realiz","room","must","move","leaven","also","realiz","room","trap","mark
