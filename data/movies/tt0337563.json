Thanks to some wishing dust, Jenna's prayer has been answered. With a knockout body, a dream apartment, a fabulous wardrobe, an athlete boyfriend, a dream job, and superstar friends, this can't be a better life. Unfortunately, Jenna realizes that this is not what she wanted. The only one that she needs is her childhood best friend, Matt, a boy that she thought destroyed her party. But when she finds him, he's a grown up, and not the same person that she knew.","tokens":["jenna","rink","jennif","garner/christa","b","allen","girl","celebr","13th","birthdai","1987","wish","30","hope","would","help","overcom","unpopular","school","jenna","especi","want","join","six","chick","school","cliqu","led","luci","tom","tom","wyman","judi","greer/alexandra","kyle","take","advantag","jenna","desir","fit","manipul","jenna","best","friend","matt","flamhaff","mark","ruffalo/sean","marquett","give","doll","dream","hous","built","packet","magic","wish","dust","birthdai","sprinkl","roof","hous","tom","tom","dash","jenna","hope","join","six","chick","pull","cruel","practic","joke","game","seven","minut","heaven","jenna","mistakenli","think","matt","respons","get","angri","barricad","closet","put","dream","hous","she","cri","rock","back","forth","bump","wall","wish","thirti","flirti","thrive","the","wish","dust","dollhous","sprinkl","second","later","jenna","awaken","30","year","old","woman","live","fifth","avenu","apart","without","friend","famili","it","2004","jenna","memori","17","year","pass","sinc","13th","birthdai","30","year","old","jenna","new","best","friend","luci","longer","nicknam","tom","tom","drive","work","offic","soon","jenna","discov","work","pois","favorit","fashion","magazin","teenag","without","best","friend","1987","jenna","ask","assist","track","matt","to","dismai","jenna","learn","matti","estrang","sinc","high","school","jenna","fell","crowd","matt","engag","thi","complic","fact","jenna","becom","shadow","former","self","she","lost","almost","contact","parent","affair","husband","traci","art","depart","not","gener","despis","co","worker","suspect","give","magazin","idea","rival","public","sparkl","jenna","slowli","realiz","person","becom","neither","trustworthi","likeabl","unknowingli","begin","revers","situat","distanc","new","shallow","boyfriend","act","kinder","honest","co","worker","friend","try","restor","relationship","matt","after","jenna","overhear","luci","badmouth","co","worker","sadli","realiz","thought","want","import","she","head","back","hometown","new","jersei","reunit","parent","reminisc","look","school","yearbook","item","school","dai","these","inspir","return","manhattan","over","sever","out","work","togeth","magazin","project","jenna","becom","friend","matt","although","matt","engag","jenna","boyfriend","kiss","nighttim","walk","daze","matt","realiz","love","jenna","cannot","chang","past","after","arrang","magazin","photo","shoot","matt","make","success","present","plan","revamp","pois","jenna","prepar","revamp","get","bad","new","publish","pois","shut","work","put","relaunch","end","sparkl","jenna","learn","respons","sabotag","pois","within","send","materi","sparkl","month","when","luci","learn","con","matt","sign","photo","right","relaunch","shoot","she","accept","posit","sparkl","editor","chief","us","jenna","work","girl","high","school","when","alreadi","distraught","jenna","discov","matt","get","marri","dai","rush","hous","beg","call","wed","matt","cannot","sai","ye","although","tell","jenna","love","from","closet","pull","dream","hous","made","17","year","give","back","jenna","leav","tear","cry","dream","hous","wish","could","return","1987","unbeknownst","jenna","speck","wish","dust","remain","dream","hous","wish","grant","thirteen","kiss","matt","confront","snobbi","luci","tom","tom","tear","homework","luci","manipul","write","spill","juic","tom","tom","outfit","happili","lead","matt","awai","at","futur","date","presum","2004","adult","jenna","matt","emerg","newlyw","move","home","ident","dream","hous","matt","built","jenna","13","share","packet","favorit","childhood","candi","razzl","sourc","wikipedia","bangs_mccoi"],"tmdb_score_value":6.3,"tmdb_score_count":1690,"imdb_score_value":6.1,"imdb_score_count":137483,"meta_score_value":57.0,"meta_score_count":137483}
