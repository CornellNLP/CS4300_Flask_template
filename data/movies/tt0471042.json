He is close to all the tenants, especially financier Arthur Shaw. One day Shaw is arrested by the FBI for fraud. Josh thinks it's a misunderstanding that can be resolved, but later he learns that the employees' pension fund - which he asked Shaw to handle - is gone. When one of the employees tries to kill himself, Josh's views of Shaw change. He goes to see him and loses his temper, and his job. The FBI agent in charge tells him that Shaw might walk, and recovering the pension fund is unlikely. She tells him that it's been rumored that Shaw has $20 million lying around if he needs it in a hurry. Josh thinks he knows where it is, so with two other fired employees and an evicted tenant, they set out to get into Shaw's penthouse to get the money. But they realize they need the assistance of someone who knows how to steal, so Josh asks an old acquaintance named Slide who he knows is a thief to help them.","tokens":["josh","kovac","build","manag","the","tower","high","rise","luxuri","apart","complex","central","park","west","new","york","citi","whose","employe","includ","concierg","charli","brother","law","enriqu","elev","oper","lester","doorman","near","retir","odessa","maid","miss","iovenko","furtiv","studi","bar","exam","work","on","morn","josh","see","appear","kidnap","tower","tenant","wealthi","businessman","arthur","shaw","josh","give","chase","almost","catch","clotheslin","fbi","agent","clair","denham","denham","explain","shaw","kidnap","attempt","flee","arrest","accus","run","ponzi","scheme","josh","tell","tower","staff","shaw","arrest","explain","gave","shaw","pension","fund","invest","monei","gone","josh","charli","enriqu","visit","shaw","hous","arrest","penthous","apart","josh","tell","shaw","lester","attempt","suicid","lose","everyth","shaw","express","condol","appear","insincer","josh","respond","destroi","window","ferrari","250","shaw","displai","apart","the","build","owner","furiou","josh","action","fire","josh","charli","enriqu","josh","meet","denham","bar","invit","get","drunk","as","drink","sai","shaw","must","cash","safeti","net","suggest","jest","find","steal","josh","gather","charli","enriqu","former","tower","tenant","mr","fitzhugh","draw","plan","steal","shaw","monei","charli","bring","obviou","drawback","thiev","josh","hire","neighbor","petti","crimin","name","slide","help","slide","train","team","realiz","cannot","robberi","know","crack","safe","shaw","apart","thei","bring","odessa","whose","famili","ran","locksmith","busi","charli","tell","josh","rehir","tower","new","manag","charli","warn","josh","stai","awai","arrest","denham","tell","josh","hear","shaw","schedul","thanksgiv","maci","dai","parad","avoid","public","shaw","go","free","josh","team","decid","break","shaw","apart","parad","the","team","reach","shaw","apart","break","fals","wall","find","shaw","safe","behind","odessa","open","safe","find","empti","slide","fitzhugh","struggl","slide","gun","gun","goe","bullet","hit","car","reveal","gold","underneath","ferrari","paint","thei","realiz","shaw","invest","cash","gold","gold","melt","cast","car","part","assembl","car","apart","gold","would","hidden","plain","sight","josh","find","ledger","shaw","illeg","financ","car","glove","box","thei","lower","car","window","fitzhugh","old","apart","six","floor","take","lobbi","top","elev","just","reach","lobbi","agent","denham","shaw","return","take","elev","back","denham","see","shaw","safe","inform","declar","safe","inventori","item","taken","arrest","violat","condit","bail","she","remand","back","custodi","denham","see","lester","us","stolen","truck","try","escap","build","she","catch","assum","flee","ferrari","find","truck","empti","the","fbi","arrest","josh","accomplic","she","person","handcuff","josh","privat","congratul","as","josh","question","fbi","miss","iovenko","arriv","tell","fbi","pass","bar","exam","three","dai","ago","act","josh","attornei","she","show","shaw","ledger","tell","turn","exchang","everyon","freedom","the","fbi","accept","condit","josh","primari","conspir","must","serv","minim","two","year","sentenc","the","team","retriev","car","hide","place","shaw","rooftop","pool","send","variou","part","car","tower","employe","compens","lost","pension","as","movi","end","shaw","begin","life","sentenc","josh","book","jail","satisfi","smile","slowli","form","face"],"tmdb_score_value":5.9,"tmdb_score_count":1151,"imdb_score_value":6.2,"imdb_score_count":118931,"meta_score_value":59.0,"meta_score_count":118931}
