believe.","tokens":["the","movi","open","molli","bloom","jessica","chastain","narrat","life","stori","voic","she","explain","true","chang","name","except","we","see","olymp","ski","trial","import","dai","life","her","father","larri","kevin","costner","watch","he","extrem","tough","molli","grow","flashback","see","push","three","children","excel","academ","athlet","even","cruel","demand","as","molli","begin","qualifi","run","freak","accid","pine","bough","offici","lai","visibl","frozen","hard","unsnap","ski","crash","horribl","she","lai","ground","unconsci","the","movi","jump","present","time","line","molli","sleep","apart","locat","somewher","lo","angel","copi","book","written","tow","fbi","arrest","run","illeg","gambl","ring","she","tell","run","game","two","year","back","flashback","ski","accid","molli","move","l","a","want","take","time","go","law","school","fun","she","begin","cocktail","waitress","catch","ey","produc","dean","keith","jeremi","strong","find","smart","capabl","he","hire","assist","on","night","ask","organ","poker","game","molli","get","food","drink","surpris","poker","player","includ","incred","famou","actor","like","player","x","michael","cera","busi","mogul","richest","power","men","world","thei","plai","ten","thousand","dollar","after","game","player","tip","thousand","molli","realiz","lucr","career","could","in","present","dai","molli","new","york","arraign","meet","attornei","charli","jaffei","idri","elba","he","feel","bad","think","case","mess","govern","accus","someth","russian","mobster","molli","explain","player","game","involv","deeper","level","he","necessarili","believ","mention","afford","pai","yet","the","govern","seiz","five","million","dollar","wai","collect","2","million","debt","ow","street","she","hope","sell","book","make","abl","pai","he","skeptic","agre","help","arraign","refer","someon","els","arraign","realiz","reason","never","sold","street","debt","sure","new","debt","holder","would","collect","take","client","in","flashback","molli","start","make","monei","run","game","lifestyl","improv","well","qualiti","game","she","scout","vet","new","player","provid","drink","food","run","bank","eventu","dean","keith","insist","molli","make","enough","monei","run","game","go","stop","pai","assist","but","tell","keep","assist","take","game","molli","instead","take","game","move","fanci","hotel","put","monei","make","incred","event","eventu","player","x","reveal","real","cruel","streak","admiss","enjoi","destroi","player","live","when","molli","confront","steal","game","move","anoth","locat","cut","molli","think","quit","ahead","want","stop","move","new","york","start","similar","high","stake","game","the","game","becom","success","new","york","eventu","player","start","reneg","debt","molli","begin","take","monei","pot","break","law","abl","protect","she","also","begin","us","drug","stai","awak","hour","italian","mob","member","approach","molli","take","cut","exchang","collect","debt","declin","send","goon","hotel","brutal","assault","she","luck","mob","bust","happen","shortli","but","eventu","get","call","game","raid","fbi","she","know","sever","player","russian","mob","that","dai","quit","run","game","anoth","two","year","back","present","dai","molli","charli","meet","prosecutor","thei","want","inform","mob","deal","molli","thei","believ","know","molli","explain","end","game","addict","drug","gotten","sloppi","job","charli","give","impass","speech","argu","molli","moral","charact","innoc","eventu","prosecutor","reach","deal","charli","present","immun","fortun","return","turn","hard","drive","molli","refus","sinc","content","noth","crimin","activ","text","messag","player","inform","tear","famili","apart","ruin","live","charli","desper","want","molli","take","deal","refus","molli","goe","ic","skate","clear","head","father","find","he","come","trial","thei","heart","heart","discuss","molli","want","know","alwai","cruel","never","like","much","brother","he","admit","knew","molli","discov","affair","shame","led","cruel","he","admit","much","love","want","protect","molli","refus","turn","hard","drive","plead","guilti","court","judg","find","sentenc","recommend","prosecutor","far","harsh","instead","sentenc","commun","servic","molli","celebr","famili","unsur","sudden","new","leas","life","we","return","open","scene","molli","crash","horrif","ski","trial","her","father","rush","side","awaken","declar","fine","begin","stand","the","ski","comment","believ","recoveri","make","in","narrat","molli","note","although","lost","lot","paid","consequ","learn","lot","along","wai","winston","churchil","defin","success","abil","move","failur","failur","loss","enthusiasm","the","messag","go","land","feet","somewher","somehow"],"tmdb_score_value":6.9,"tmdb_score_count":610,"imdb_score_value":7.5,"imdb_score_count":49502,"meta_score_value":71.0,"meta_score_count":49502}
