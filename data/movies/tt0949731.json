It's about the sudden, mysterious disappearance of bees. Yet again Nature is doing something inexplicable, and whatever science has to say about it will be, in the end, only a theory. Scientists will bring out more theories, but no explanations, when a more urgent dilemma hits the planet. It begins in Central Park. Suddenly and inexplicably, the behavior of everyone in the park changes in a most bizarre and horrible way. Soon, the strange behavior spreads throughout the city and beyond. Elliot, his wife, Alma, and Jess, the young daughter of a friend, will only have theories to guide them where to run and where to hide. But theories may not be enough.","tokens":["the","film","open","new","york","peopl","start","get","confus","central","park","repeat","word","stand","still","sometim","walk","backward","scott","troost","we","hear","scream","a","woman","alison","folland","read","bench","take","silver","chopstick","style","hair","pin","hair","stab","neck","meanwhil","build","site","worker","curti","mcclarin","michael","den","dekker","ground","chat","sudden","bodi","fall","panick","think","worker","fell","roof","mistak","rush","broken","bodi","while","look","bodi","anoth","thud","anoth","worker","thei","look","cornel","womack","confus","on","possibl","two","unlik","third","fall","seem","imposs","then","yet","anoth","anoth","crash","earth","when","look","see","mani","run","edg","appar","look","complet","calm","sure","action","in","next","shot","see","scienc","teacher","name","elliot","moor","mark","wahlberg","talk","event","scienc","explain","thousand","disappear","bee","bodi","left","trace","a","student","offer","opinion","natur","event","never","fulli","understand","sever","student","sophi","burk","alex","van","kooi","charli","saxton","start","specul","phenomenon","disappear","bee","elliot","suddenli","call","class","staff","meet","warn","appar","terrorist","attack","new","york","terrorist","appar","releas","kind","ga","central","park","advis","school","cancel","as","leav","elliot","confess","friend","julian","john","leguizamo","math","teacher","wife","problem","elliot","wife","alma","zooei","deschanel","flee","philadelphia","train","julian","daughter","jess","ashlyn","sanchez","on","train","peopl","start","get","report","cellphon","attack","report","destin","mani","place","alma","get","repeat","insist","call","phone","someon","call","joei","m","night","shyamalan","voic","li","elliot","the","movi","move","show","rittenhous","park","philadelphia","woman","jann","elli","walk","dog","breez","begin","blow","a","traffic","cop","don","castro","walk","traffic","jam","stop","comment","taxi","driver","call","sal","bill","chemerka","chilli","weather","suddenli","everyon","stop","track","dog","run","across","road","leash","drop","ground","lead","us","back","cop","stand","still","front","cab","a","gunshot","ring","drop","ground","as","blood","spurt","bullet","wound","forehead","taxi","driver","get","walk","dead","cop","pick","gun","besid","bodi","shoot","forehead","well","a","woman","high","heel","step","sidewalk","pick","gun","hear","anoth","gunshot","the","train","end","leav","elliott","alma","julian","jess","passeng","small","rural","town","conductor","lost","radio","contact","everyon","els","at","diner","see","newscast","suggest","suicid","caus","terrorist","attack","natur","phenomena","a","report","sai","toxin","switch","part","brain","keep","us","harm","julian","lost","phone","contact","wife","visit","princeton","start","panic","ladi","show","elliot","youtub","type","video","sent","iphon","show","man","walk","lion","den","zoo","taunt","lion","hand","try","get","attack","graphic","shot","stagger","arm","eaten","julian","find","lift","peopl","head","princeton","leav","jess","elliot","alma","when","get","princeton","also","infect","dozen","peopl","hang","tree","road","the","driver","car","crash","deliber","tree","high","speed","julian","slash","wrist","broken","windscreen","glass","di","on","time","see","anyth","graphic","camera","cut","awai","see","less","scene","red","band","trailer","see","julian","bleed","wrist","meanwhil","elliot","alma","decid","along","everybodi","els","flee","state","line","jess","attack","seem","affect","northeast","us","a","nice","coupl","run","plant","nurseri","offer","take","car","the","man","suggest","elliot","alma","toxin","produc","plant","he","explain","wai","plant","commun","plant","wai","releas","chemic","get","rid","specif","pest","while","try","reach","state","line","see","bodi","ahead","road","turn","back","meet","mani","car","converg","countri","road","junction","report","bodi","back","wai","come","organ","armi","privat","abandon","car","strike","foot","head","small","remot","hous","develop","on","man","happen","realtor","joel","de","la","fuent","know","it","new","small","map","except","local","on","hope","safe","terrorist","sinc","appear","focus","larg","citi","road","from","junction","on","group","leav","immedi","take","minut","get","thing","car","walk","across","field","two","group","the","smaller","group","10","12","peopl","elliot","alma","jess","front","the","larger","20","25","peopl","includ","soldier","plant","coupl","behind","3","4","minut","thi","larger","group","get","infect","soldier","becom","delusion","shout","someth","soldier","gun","friend","leav","then","elliot","group","hear","gunshot","on","on","presum","us","soldier","gun","kill","elliot","start","believ","inde","plant","toxin","trigger","larg","group","peopl","he","yell","everyon","split","smaller","group","group","peel","three","smaller","group","run","awai","differ","direct","alma","tell","elliot","go","die","want","tell","someth","on","night","told
