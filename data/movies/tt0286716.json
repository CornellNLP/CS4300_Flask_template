Confused and curious about his survival, Banner discovers that since the accident, whenever he becomes angry, he transforms into a giant green monster destroying everything in sight in an act of rage. Bruce's mysterious past and the answer to why the radiation had this effect becomes revealed to him as his birth father David Banner intervenes with hopes to continue experimenting on him.","tokens":["bruce","banner","eric","bana","research","scientist","berkelei","california","laboratori","hi","work","focus","us","nanom","gamma","radiat","cure","cancer","diseas","unfortun","experi","end","test","anim","explod","he","work","betti","ross","jennif","connelli","recent","romant","involv","broken","bruce","withdrawn","emotion","although","neither","know","father","work","togeth","armi","base","new","mexico","late","1960","david","banner","paul","kersei","driven","research","scientist","intent","unlock","secret","regener","tissu","human","could","regrow","lost","limb","sgt","ross","todd","tesen","shut","brian","experi","learn","experi","david","awar","risk","alreadi","fear","pass","genet","mutat","young","bruce","bruce","quiet","troubl","child","comfort","presenc","mother","edith","cara","buono","after","fire","david","sabotag","equip","result","explos","base","he","went","home","fought","edith","tri","kill","young","bruce","instead","accident","kill","edith","david","arrest","incarcer","mental","hospit","bruce","place","foster","parent","he","repress","memori","parent","bruce","work","foster","parent","name","krensler","betti","father","recogn","iron","ross","overse","research","betti","bruce","perform","glenn","talbot","josh","luca","us","work","lab","betti","bruce","sinc","move","privat","corpor","atheon","he","return","lab","flirt","betti","offer","bruce","unlimit","budget","bring","research","corpor","thei","refus","bruce","anger","begin","rise","anywai","later","dai","experi","goe","horribl","awri","bruce","expos","massiv","dose","nanom","gamma","radiat","unlik","test","subject","howev","die","in","hospit","visit","strang","man","earlier","begun","work","lab","janitor","although","bruce","recogn","father","nick","nolt","hi","father","suggest","bruce","secret","reserv","power","hidden","within","disappear","after","releas","hospit","bruce","return","work","he","hear","phone","messag","betti","discuss","meet","gener","ross","sam","elliot","talbot","offer","bruce","rage","spiral","control","transform","hulk","superhumanli","power","green","skin","creatur","he","destroi","lab","throw","gamma","radiat","gener","park","lot","when","see","father","observ","rampag","hulk","leap","awai","confus","becaus","bruce","last","person","lab","suspicion","destroi","place","lockdown","ross","betti","goe","see","david","he","tell","well","bruce","power","curtli","show","door","upset","betti","drive","cabin","mountain","david","creat","trio","superpow","gamma","dog","us","equip","purloin","lab","us","scarf","left","behind","give","dog","betti","scent","send","kill","he","call","bruce","tell","done","coax","hulk","just","talbot","arriv","confront","bruce","ross","order","talbot","leav","betti","bruce","alon","enrag","talbot","he","tri","beat","bruce","manag","anger","enough","caus","anoth","transform","hulk","hulk","beat","talbot","badli","escap","armi","guard","find","protect","betti","at","mountain","cabin","fight","kill","gamma","dog","exhaust","transform","back","bruce","betti","ey","the","next","morn","armi","arriv","sedat","bruce","betti","unsur","call","father","night","by","ross","know","bruce","he","bruce","betti","taken","back","new","mexico","base","david","work","earlier","betti","bruce","walk","ground","attempt","understand","bruce","becam","befor","real","breakthrough","made","ross","superior","place","bruce","talbot","care","talbot","assur","find","caus","bruce","becom","hulk","har","power","militari","betti","leav","base","talbot","taunt","bruce","knock","bruce","place","isol","tank","talbot","perform","test","as","talbot","probe","howev","unleash","hulk","the","hulk","break","free","tank","begin","wreak","havoc","armi","base","in","process","talbot","kill","ross","decid","free","hulk","base","destroi","outsid","the","hulk","destroi","four","armi","heavi","tank","leap","desert","hide","ross","forc","find","lead","armi","chase","throughout","southwestern","unit","state","battl","briefli","small","unit","comanch","chopper","fire","seri","rock","tower","buri","hulk","escap","head","direct","san","francisco","there","proce","wreak","havoc","citi","betti","arriv","calm","he","transform","back","bruce","david","us","restor","gamma","radiat","gener","nanom","make","superhuman","he","abl","adopt","physic","properti","anyth","come","contact","he","contact","betti","agre","turn","gen","ross","allow","see","bruce","ross","agre","father","son","meet","abandon","warehous","david","tri","persuad","bruce","accept","power","join","bruce","refus","david","tap","powerlin","becom","live","electr","bruce","transform","hulk","two","men","battl","thei","eventu","wind","seclud","lake","david","decid","absorb","bruce","power","howev","bruce","power","immens","david","cannot","contain","explod","as","happen","armi","drop","bomb","site","destroi","bruce","bodi","never","found","ross","keep","touch","betti","hope","bruce","ever","contact","would","tell","but","know","in","south","american","rain","forest","american","do
