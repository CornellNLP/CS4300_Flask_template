Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve them. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his \"mother\", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically.","tokens":["the","stori","take","place","futur","greenhous","gase","caus","polar","icecap","melt","flood","coastal","citi","to","combat","popul","peopl","wish","children","must","appli","licens","the","film","start","offic","compani","call","cybertron","owner","professor","allen","hobbi","william","hurt","wish","push","mecha","aka","robot","technolog","make","creation","love","when","colleagu","mention","love","unit","hobbi","correct","talk","physic","love","emot","love","child","mother","the","narr","move","18","month","futur","swinton","whose","son","martin","jake","thoma","current","cryostasi","cure","found","debilit","diseas","stricken","hi","mother","monica","franc","o","connor","held","well","emotion","condit","taken","son","hope","help","cope","husband","henri","sam","robard","cybertron","employe","take","part","test","wherein","would","abl","famili","compani","newest","mecha","david","halei","joel","osment","culmin","hobbi","research","make","robot","love","at","first","monica","angri","believ","husband","try","replac","martin","howev","monica","tri","adapt","david","henri","also","inform","choos","keep","david","must","imprint","upon","howev","ever","come","time","chose","want","due","imprint","perman","david","would","need","sent","back","cybertron","destroi","after","time","monica","decid","perform","imprint","process","read","list","word","activ","david","emot","simul","when","david","call","mommi","begin","act","like","real","child","to","provid","david","anoth","form","companionship","give","robot","teddi","bear","call","teddi","belong","martin","thing","appear","go","well","swinton","on","dai","cure","bring","martin","back","health","martin","look","upon","david","human","supertoi","doll","on","dai","martin","ask","mother","read","pinocchio","david","becom","enamor","wooden","puppet","becom","real","boi","thank","stori","blue","fairi","martin","tri","get","david","troubl","number","wai","first","cajol","david","eat","spinach","caus","david","malfunct","need","clean","anoth","time","tell","david","cut","monica","hair","sleep","gestur","love","incid","make","henri","think","david","try","attack","wife","at","martin","birthdai","parti","on","friend","decid","test","david","see","wai","prevent","pain","the","test","caus","david","grab","onto","martin","cry","keep","safe","the","two","fall","swinton","swim","pool","seem","david","attempt","drown","martin","henri","decid","david","longer","safe","convinc","monica","return","david","destroi","monica","tri","take","david","cybertron","cover","stori","go","picnic","howev","cannot","bring","take","david","directli","cybertron","abandon","forest","along","teddi","david","becom","frighten","confus","question","forc","leav","mother","meanwhil","male","prostitut","mecha","gigolo","joe","arriv","apart","woman","see","regularli","he","chang","appear","suit","enter","bedroom","find","dead","her","husband","appear","kiss","wife","sai","i","might","kill","kill","first","joe","retreat","realiz","woman","husband","frame","murder","joe","rush","apart","build","cut","registr","tag","avoid","detect","polic","still","forest","david","conclud","abandon","real","like","martin","find","blue","fairi","like","stori","pinocchio","could","make","real","would","abl","go","home","journei","wood","come","across","number","abandon","obsolet","broken","mecha","search","cybertron","junk","pile","spare","part","repair","the","mecha","round","man","name","lord","johnson","johnson","brendan","gleeson","taken","flesh","fair","mecha","destroi","amus","anti","mecha","fanat","david","brought","ring","along","mecha","name","gigolo","joe","when","bucket","acid","drop","joe","david","cri","show","fear","like","real","boi","the","crowd","revolt","johnson","johnson","amid","result","riot","david","joe","set","free","leav","escap","nearbi","wood","david","tell","joe","search","blue","fairi","joe","confid","find","place","call","roug","citi","hitch","ride","teenag","make","citi","mecca","adult","entertain","rival","la","vega","disneyland","their","journei","take","place","knowledg","comput","represent","einstein","call","dr","know","voic","robin","william","tell","blue","fairi","found","end","world","lion","weep","joe","explain","david","dr","know","must","mean","place","call","man","hattan","mani","mecha","gone","end","world","never","come","back","david","go","man","hattan","despit","danger","howev","joe","tri","deter","sai","could","trap","as","david","joe","leav","build","joe","accost","offic","come","arrest","murder","fact","david","unawar","see","vehicl","sit","nearbi","call","amphibicopt","david","take","control","manag","releas","joe","clutch","offic","joe","get","take","control","guid","man","hattan","their","journei","lead","flood","new","york","citi","find","cybertron","build","sit","statu","lion","weep","water","ey","david","enter","room","find","anoth","mecha","look","like","howev","feel","duplic","could","plan","take","mother","awai","david","destroi","jealou","rage
