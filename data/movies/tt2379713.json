Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh, the new head of the Centre of National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6 led by M. Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny and Q to help him seek out Madeleine Swann, the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White, who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of the assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, he learns a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks.","tokens":["a","cryptic","messag","past","send","jame","bond","rogu","mission","mexico","citi","eventu","rome","meet","lucia","beauti","forbidden","widow","infam","crimin","bond","infiltr","secret","meet","uncov","exist","sinist","organis","known","spectr","meanwhil","back","london","max","denbigh","new","head","centr","nation","secur","question","bond","action","challeng","relev","mi6","led","m","bond","covertli","enlist","moneypenni","q","help","seek","madelein","swann","daughter","old","nemesi","mr","white","mai","hold","clue","untangl","web","spectr","as","daughter","assassin","understand","bond","wai","other","cannot","as","bond","ventur","toward","heart","spectr","learn","chill","connect","enemi","seek"],"tmdb_score_value":6.3,"tmdb_score_count":5438,"imdb_score_value":6.8,"imdb_score_count":330932,"meta_score_value":60.0,"meta_score_count":330932}
