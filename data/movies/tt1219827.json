When terrorism reaches a new level that includes the ability to hack into people's minds and control them, Major Kusanagi is uniquely qualified to stop it. As she prepares to face a new enemy, Major Kusanagi discovers that she has been lied to: her life was not saved, it was stolen. She will stop at nothing to recover her past, find out who did this to her and stop them before they do it to others.","tokens":["in","near","futur","human","becom","enhanc","cybernet","upgrad","hanka","robot","top","compani","type","technolog","verg","develop","new","kind","cyborg","us","human","brain","function","a","woman","name","mira","killian","scarlett","johansson","taken","hanka","accid","her","brain","put","cybernet","bodi","greater","strength","agil","onc","process","complet","design","dr","ouelet","juliett","binoch","talk","hanka","ceo","cutter","peter","ferdinando","cutter","want","put","mira","section","9","anti","terror","squad","ouelet","feel","readi","someth","like","on","year","later","mira","known","the","major","she","roof","build","listen","meet","hanka","repres","dr","osmond","african","ambassador","chri","obi","the","major","receiv","order","section","9","chief","daisuk","aramaki","takeshi","kitano","work","alongsid","batou","pilou","absaek","ladriya","danusia","samal","in","confer","sever","geisha","bot","start","attack","peopl","room","lead","the","major","spring","action","aramaki","order","she","goe","invis","jump","roof","swing","room","start","shoot","geisha","bot","on","geisha","bot","hack","dr","osmond","neck","kill","the","major","get","the","geisha","bot","sai","commit","hanka","destroi","the","major","shoot","the","section","9","team","meet","aramaki","discuss","attack","thei","learn","geisha","bot","hack","mysteri","sourc","also","utter","phrase","geisha","bot","said","the","major","the","rest","team","leav","aramaki","talk","the","major","move","jump","room","aramaki","tell","still","ghost","soul","within","shell","cyborg","bodi","the","major","meet","dr","ouelet","frequent","fix","bodi","damag","the","major","troubl","rememb","past","see","brief","glimps","flash","ouelet","dismiss","hallucin","glitch","shown","care","the","major","the","major","batou","drive","around","citi","she","mention","littl","memori","past","involv","famili","dy","get","countri","on","road","the","major","see","hallucin","burn","hut","the","major","batou","meet","dr","dahlin","anamaria","marinca","geisha","bot","bodi","the","major","deep","dive","geisha","bot","ai","try","get","answer","hacker","the","major","find","walk","club","distort","imag","she","grab","entiti","forc","batou","pull","connect","the","major","sai","know","find","hacker","the","two","go","yakuza","nightclub","ladriya","the","major","pull","room","two","men","forc","danc","handcuf","pole","zap","cattl","prod","the","room","also","block","signal","commun","batou","the","major","start","fight","men","room","kick","on","room","lead","shootout","batou","engag","he","the","major","kill","number","goon","head","find","hacker","thei","run","toward","room","realli","trap","a","bomb","goe","damag","the","major","bodi","blind","batou","batou","receiv","cybernet","ey","replac","damag","on","the","major","bodi","repair","meanwhil","cutter","meet","aramaki","anger","the","major","deep","dive","aramaki","warn","cutter","threaten","sinc","aramaki","answer","prime","minist","hanka","the","hacker","michael","pitt","find","dr","dahlin","rip","ey","kill","the","section","9","team","find","bodi","the","major","pull","drive","dahlin","hand","contain","name","hanka","associ","includ","ouelet","thei","figur","hacker","next","target","the","hacker","control","two","sanit","worker","ram","truck","ouelet","car","she","surviv","men","step","outsid","try","shoot","the","major","partner","arriv","time","shoot","back","men","she","chase","on","man","lee","run","bodi","water","the","major","fight","invis","batou","show","stop","lee","interrog","hacker","connect","sever","he","tell","section","9","wai","pick","daughter","the","major","show","photo","see","daughter","realli","pictur","thei","determin","hacker","place","fake","memori","lee","head","the","hacker","whose","name","learn","kuze","speak","lee","threaten","section","9","make","lee","jump","hang","cabl","around","neck","section","9","member","togusa","chin","han","trace","hacker","signal","hidden","locat","the","major","find","kuze","connect","network","humanoid","cyborg","bodi","kuze","reveal","test","subject","hanka","consid","failur","freak","due","deform","outcom","the","major","see","tattoo","chest","burn","hut","like","hallucin","kuze","sai","hanka","took","control","live","instead","save","the","major","confront","ouelet","revel","ouelet","sai","98","fail","experi","the","major","becam","first","success","on","the","major","appear","angri","even","ouelet","tri","defend","posit","cutter","order","ouelet","termin","the","major","due","liabil","as","the","major","undergo","process","ouelet","instead","give","address","find","answer","ouelet","let","the","major","escap","cutter","shoot","kill","ouelet","retali","cutter","report","aramaki","the","major","kill","ouelet","must","termin","the","major","follow","address","turn","old","home","her","mother","kaori","momoi","believ","daughter","ran","awai","kill","the","major","real","name","motoko","kusanagi","her","mother","sens","familiar","look","the","major","e
