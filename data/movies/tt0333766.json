His somewhat controlling and psychiatrist father has led Andrew (\"Large\") to believe that his mother's wheelchair bound life was his fault. Andrew decides to lay off the drugs that his father and his doctor made him believe that he needed, and began to see life for what it is. He began to feel the pain he had longed for, and began to have a genuine relationship with a girl who had some problems of her own.","tokens":["andrew","largeman","wake","bizarr","nightmar","crash","plane","telephon","messag","father","tell","andrew","need","return","home","mother","di","andrew","leav","lo","angel","return","home","state","new","jersei","attend","mother","funer","he","recogn","gravedigg","old","friend","invit","parti","night","he","take","ecstasi","refus","cocain","parti","remain","detach","also","impress","abund","usag","drug","inde","last","time","seen","take","drug","at","home","andrew","father","book","doctor","appoint","headach","dure","scene","father","tell","lie","take","back","sai","know","li","the","morn","parti","andrew","proce","doctor","appoint","meet","wait","room","girl","name","sam","patholog","liar","she","later","explain","time","know","li","like","tic","still","on","trust","admit","li","dure","scene","tell","listen","music","sai","chang","life","listen","appreci","song","in","andrew","meet","doctor","reveal","andrew","lithium","well","mood","stabil","anti","depress","entir","adult","life","stop","take","he","also","sai","father","also","psychiatrist","put","medic","first","place","andrew","find","sam","outsid","offic","eventu","offer","ride","home","sam","invit","hous","meet","mother","after","return","home","andrew","father","confront","insist","talk","andrew","leav","town","right","see","andrew","stare","mark","rob","tomb","anoth","andrew","friend","state","town","mess","drug","usag","even","exempt","thi","usag","also","depict","directli","number","scene","throughout","movi","andrew","return","sam","hous","two","spend","rest","dai","togeth","join","friend","later","andrew","tell","nine","year","old","push","mother","result","accid","left","parapleg","sai","believ","father","blame","wife","paralysi","put","medic","protect","anger","supposedli","harbor","sam","listen","non","judgment","andrew","subsequ","express","interest","the","next","dai","on","andrew","friend","mark","tell","andrew","need","help","track","go","awai","present","sam","andrew","mark","spend","dai","track","present","end","quarri","newark","mark","talk","albert","wife","coupl","emploi","watch","area","also","modest","antiqu","jewelri","sale","thei","discuss","reason","albert","wife","chose","live","the","hous","describ","albert","privat","ark","possibl","refer","work","titl","movi","larg","ark","[citat","needed]","also","live","explor","abyss","found","quarri","describ","someth","complet","uniqu","never","done","direct","quot","earlier","sam","speech","final","albert","explain","actual","matter","famili","camera","show","right","listen","sam","andrew","a","moment","later","two","kiss","first","time","shout","infinit","abyss","reason","directli","explain","movi","left","watcher","interpret","when","look","gift","turn","andrew","mother","favorit","pendant","mark","taken","awai","grave","probabl","sold","afterward","andrew","approach","father","talk","father","suggest","sai","blame","mother","accid","live","life","without","medic","he","nevertheless","forgiv","father","sai","want","build","better","relationship","the","morn","andrew","sai","goodby","sam","airport","acknowledg","chang","life","leav","plane","take","back","life","lo","angel","fix","problem","continu","relationship","we","later","see","sam","desper","cry","andrew","unexpectedli","return","tell","sam","want","wast","life","without"],"tmdb_score_value":7.1,"tmdb_score_count":790,"imdb_score_value":7.5,"imdb_score_count":196813,"meta_score_value":67.0,"meta_score_count":196813}
