However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their world.","tokens":["a","vike","boi","call","hiccup","voic","jai","baruchel","introduc","villag","berk","seven","gener","everi","singl","build","new","the","villag","attack","dragon","steal","food","mostli","sheep","set","thing","fire","henc","new","build","the","villag","grab","weapon","try","fight","dragon","despit","told","everi","adult","sight","go","indoor","hiccup","haul","bola","shoot","cannon","made","shoot","dragon","night","sky","as","assist","villag","blacksmith","gobber","voic","craig","ferguson","hiccup","access","tool","materi","know","us","the","dragon","land","wood","distanc","form","villag","on","believ","hit","anyth","next","dai","hiccup","go","look","it","turn","rare","deadli","night","furi","hiccup","make","kill","instead","releas","whereupon","also","refrain","kill","hiccup","fli","tree","hiccup","discov","dragon","eventu","call","toothless","retract","teeth","hole","steep","side","vallei","longer","fly","feet","time","while","sketch","dragon","hiccup","realiz","miss","tail","fin","he","make","prosthet","tail","fin","leather","the","new","fin","help","toothless","control","inadvert","take","hiccup","ride","give","clear","idea","need","help","dragon","fly","right","in","seri","workshop","test","flight","scene","hiccup","build","perfect","saddl","control","mechan","tail","fin","safeti","har","meanwhil","hiccup","father","stoick","voic","gerard","butler","sign","dragon","train","gobber","differ","train","alreadi","toothless","go","learn","fight","dragon","at","first","worst","student","class","sinc","hiccup","alwai","accid","prone","klutz","come","surpris","classmat","astrid","voic","america","ferrera","snotlout","voic","jonah","hill","fishleg","voic","christoph","mintz","plass","ruffnut","voic","kristen","wiig","twin","brother","tuffnut","voic","t","j","miller","hiccup","littl","sweet","astrid","befor","long","hiccup","abl","us","thing","learn","work","toothless","sooth","manag","school","practic","dragon","it","turn","dragon","big","kitti","cat","like","pet","kind","grass","like","cat","nip","love","fish","hate","eel","when","stoick","return","fail","search","fabl","nest","dragon","surpris","thrill","hear","son","brilliantli","dragon","train","he","give","hiccup","horn","helmet","made","on","dead","mother","breastplat","but","hiccup","usual","unabl","get","around","father","expect","speak","frankli","explain","success","dragon","school","unlik","lead","slai","dragon","when","hiccup","subdu","practic","dragon","unintention","earn","privileg","kill","entir","villag","horrifi","decid","flee","toothless","howev","astrid","notic","hiccup","frequent","disappear","secret","behavior","suspici","she","follow","hidden","vallei","see","toothless","unabl","explain","relationship","dragon","hiccup","take","fly","captiv","but","get","caught","flock","dragon","return","nest","carri","food","the","dragon","fly","insid","mountain","island","drop","food","pit","turn","contain","huge","terrifi","hungri","dragon","eat","smaller","on","bring","enough","food","hiccup","astrid","shock","realiz","dragon","steal","sheep","keep","eaten","when","get","home","hiccup","convinc","astrid","reveal","locat","dragon","nest","befor","goe","punch","arm","sai","that","kidnap","then","kiss","sai","that","everyth","els","everyth","goe","wrong","dragon","kill","ceremoni","hiccup","discard","weapon","attempt","show","vike","dragon","fight","defend","stoick","other","interven","dragon","attack","toothless","come","rescu","verg","kill","stoick","hiccup","call","toothless","despit","hiccup","protest","angri","vike","chain","toothless","when","ineptli","tri","explain","hiccup","let","slip","toothless","took","nest","dragon","stoick","resolv","us","toothless","find","nest","he","listen","hiccup","warn","giant","dragon","he","load","toothless","ship","vike","fleet","sail","warrior","villag","disown","hiccup","leav","behind","when","hiccup","wonder","aloud","kill","toothless","chanc","sinc","would","avoid","astrid","challeng","explain","in","hiccup","come","epiphani","moral","charact","person","strength","astrid","faith","inspir","hiccup","classmat","mount","practic","dragon","fly","pursuit","fleet","at","dragon","island","vike","us","catapult","break","open","side","mountain","giant","dragon","trap","when","come","stoick","realiz","made","mistak","he","resolv","fight","bui","vike","time","escap","gobber","volunt","join","while","stoick","gobber","prepar","sacrific","distract","dragon","kid","arriv","join","battl","thei","manag","distract","giant","dragon","littl","set","vike","ship","fire","while","comrad","keep","giant","dragon","occupi","hiccup","tri","rescu","toothless","still","chain","burn","ship","end","water","stoick","rescu","then","toothless","hiccup","go","giant","dragon","togeth","thei","draw","cloud","awai","vike","try","get","crash","island","in","end","toothless","releas","blast","giant","dragon","open","mouth","crash","burn","appar","take","hero","see","hiccup","fall","toward","fire","toothless","tri","desper","catch","o
