 Previously, on  Helix... 
 I knew they'd send someone. 
 You drugged me. 
 She is our daughter. Don't do this. 
 I've been pregnant for the last 15 months. 
 Hey Soren, how you feeling? 
 Good, I guess. 
 The symptoms are clearing up. 
 Who wants to go next? 
 Lizzie? 
 Don't try to tell me that you don't know what's going on on your goddamn island! 
 There are no creatures outside. 
 (screaming) 
 He killed people, Sarah. 
 In Paris. After Arctic BioSystems, he became obsessed. 
 Immortality ain't forever. 
 Alan Farragut? He's here? On the island? 
 Ah! 
 Say hello to your mother and brother. Now we can all be together. 
 (screaming) 
 (fast-paced violin music) 
 (coughing) 
 Travis? 
 I missed you at breakfast this morning. Are you okay? 
 You liked it, didn't you? Being with him. You're all the same. 
 We talked about this. You said that you understood. 
 It doesn't change anything. I am a vessel for another's path. 
 The life growing inside of me belongs to all of us. 
 Travis... 
 He can't have you! (gasping) 
 (screaming) 
 (bells tolling) 
 (phone dialing) 
 (electronic signal) 
 Did you sleep well? 
 Sleep?! No. 
 What's wrong? 
 What the hell have you done to Daniel and Jaye? 
 It can be difficult being back home with family. 
 Family? 
 Daniel stomps around the cabin like a grizzly bear. 
 You do realize they're not actually here. 
 They are on a morning hike. They will come back soon. 
 We have the whole day to enjoy some quality father-daughter time. 
 Alan! 
 Alan, wake up! Come on! 
 There you are. Hey, stay with me now. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. I found you lying here a few minutes ago. 
 Looks like you took a good shot to the back of the head. 
 Who d'you piss off this time? 
 It's personal. 
 Hey, easy, easy, easy. 
 I'm fine. 
 No, you're not fine. 
 You need medical attention. 
 As much as I'd like to, I'm not gonna just leave you here. 
 Come on. 
 (bells tolling) 
 Come on. 
 Aw, man. 
 (knocking) 
 It's open. 
 Morning, Kyle. 
 How are you feeling? 
 What do you want? 
 I heard about what happened and I just wanted to apologize on behalf of my children. 
 Your children? 
 Figure of speech. They don't belong to any one family. They're of the community. 
 What I do find tragic is... how this terrible disease could have altered their behavior like that. 
 We both know that wasn't the case. 
 I'm not following you. 
 Let me spell it out for you. Those kids had no rash, no jaundice, no physical signs of the pathogen whatsoever. 
 And none of them remembers a damn thing. 
 I saw a boy attacking his own mother. 
 What else could explain such violent behavior? 
 They were under the influence of something, but not the pathogen. 
 For my money, you brainwashed those poor kids. 
 Brainwashed? 
 I think you've been reading too many spy novels. 
 I know what I saw. 
 You may have others fooled, but I know what you are. 
 Oh, really? 
 What am I? 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 The samples are ready. It's time to get back to work. 
 Dr. Jordan, I know it's not possible, but... you just seem so familiar to me. 
 Have we met? 
 No. 
 No, I'd remember. 
 Hey. What was that all about? 
 I heard a knock and there he was. Must have been following that path of his. 
 I'm fine, by the way. Nearly stoned to death yesterday, but thanks for asking. 
 Look, we don't have a treatment. And if we can't reach full containment, there'll be no stopping this. You saw what happened on that ship. 
 Alright, what do we do? Pathogen's on both sides of the gate. 
 It's not like the locals are helping any. 
 That's their fear of outsiders. 
 So what are we looking for? 
 A fungal toxin. One that's ingested rather than inhaled. 
 Means it's likely in the food supply. 
 But none of the food has tested positive. 
 Not yet. Testing everything's gonna take weeks. 
 Well, we don't have weeks. 
 But we do have a survivor. 
 Soren. 
 Far as we know, he's the only one who's had a recovery. 
 His immunity may be the key here. 
 Any idea where he's at? 
 No. But the fact that he's missing, and no one's looking very hard for him makes me think that somebody doesn't want us to find him. 
 (bells tolling) 
 woman : Oh my God, it's Travis! 
 How do you wanna handle this? 
 Infirmary. Prep him for an autopsy. 
 Olivia! Olivia! 
 Olivia, hi, I'm Dr. Jordan. Um, I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 It's very important that we find your son. Have you had any contact with him in the last 24 hours? Do you have any idea where he might be? 
 Soren is on his own path. 
 He's ten years old! 
 Our paths are not defined by our solar age. Michael says... 
 I'm not interested in what Michael says. You're his mother. What do you say? 
 Soren will return on his own time. 
 Until then, I just want to be. 
 I hope you are hungry. 
 If it's anything like the tea... 
 No harmful ingredients, except too much butter. 
 Is that supposed to be a heart? 
 I can never get them right. 
 Your mother will make more when she gets home. 
 My mother? 
 It'll be nice to see her again. 
 Mmm! 
 These are really good. 
 Same as when you were a little girl. 
 That song you were humming yesterday... reminds me of something. 
 I would sing it to you when you were scared. 
 I see why you like it here. It's just like Montana. 
 Coming here was a second chance to repay my debt to humanity. 
 And protect my legacy. 
 Uh... whatever you're protecting, I'm sick now. I don't have much time. 
 Don't worry. You will be in the therapy soon. 
 You have a therapy? 
 The disease is not important. 
 We must consider what's best for the family. 
 Oh! 
 I think I see them coming now. 
 Let's go inside. I have a surprise for you. 
 You know, I've never been a big fan of surprises. 
 What about that therapy? 
 If I told you, then it wouldn't be a surprise. 
 If you just untie me, I promise I won't leave. 
 Don't be afraid. 
 Therapy will help you join the family. 
 Join them how? 
 We saved a place at the table just for you. 
 No, you can't make me like one of them! 
 Friends, please. 
 Please. 
 I have gathered us... 
 Please listen. 
 Friends. 
 Stop!! 
 (gasping) 
 I'm here to share my thoughts with you openly and to answer all your questions as best I can about the recent tragedies. 
 Carson, tell me your truth. 
 We've all heard the rumors. 
 Isaac and the boy... 
 Soren gone... 
 Travis killing Misha... and now Jerome is missing too. 
 Are we all gonna get sick and die? 
 What are we supposed to do? 
 Uncertain as we all are, we must uphold our routine. 
 Continue the harvest. 
 Do not allow yourselves to be consumed by the doubts and fears of a world we left behind... and the doctors from the CDC. 
 Why should we trust them? 
 Everything was fine until they showed up. 
 Their paths brought them here to help us. 
 We must accept their help and give back in return. 
 But remember, hold to your true self. 
 Do not become someone else. 
 Just be. 
 Just be. 
 They're mourning, Michael. Give them time. 
 I mourn too, Anne. Deeply. 
 Did you know Misha was with child? 
 We've all lost part of our family. 
 My family! 
 And what good is a family... that can't protect the innocence of its children? 
 It was the disease that made them violent. 
 Not according to the CDC. 
 Whatever happened to the children, it's over now. 
 The harvest continues and the crop is plentiful. Everything will be back to normal soon. 
 We are a simple community, run by a simple principle. 
 We must feel... safe Uncertainty... is like a blight on the crop. 
 We cannot... allow that. 
 I need you three... to handle the matter discreetly. 
 I'm trusting you. 
 My three... best girls. 
 We won't disappoint you. 
 That's a promise. 
 Good. 
 I don't need any more pictures on this wall just yet. 
 When you act alone, it affects all of us. 
 How could you be so selfish? 
 It's not my fault Michael thinks you can't run things! 
 Don't turn this around on me. You're in charge of the children. 
 Grace told me that Landry was alone with them before the attack. 
 Landry? Whats that have to do with me? 
 Amy, please! 
 If you keep acting out, I can't protect the family. 
 Well, maybe you're not the one who should be protecting the family! 
 You watch your tongue! 
 And you, "please this, please that"... 
 One doesn't beg for respect. 
 You hit me. 
 I know what you do and who you do it with. 
 I've allowed you your games, but now your actions threaten to destroy everything we've worked for. 
 We must work together. 
 Don't forget what's most important. Where would we be if anything happened to Mother? 
 This is where you're working. 
 Not exactly state-of-the-art, I know. 
 This stuff wasn't state-of-the-art 20 years ago. How the hell do you expect to isolate this pathogen? 
 We've already isolated it. 
 (scoffing) 
 
 
 
 Sarah. 
 Yeah. 
 That is one nasty gash you've got. 
 You should see the other guy. 
 Bullshit. What really happened? 
 I told you, it's personal. 
 Personal. Like the last eight months? 
 No phone call, not even an email? 
 I'd have thought you'd be glad to see me disappear. 
 Yeah, we've... had our differences, but that doesn't mean I want you to bleed to death on some island. 
 Why here, of all places? What are you looking for? 
 You wanna stitch me up, fine. But I'm not playing twenty questions. 
 So you've got nothing to say. 
 I'll tell you the same thing I told Sarah. 
 You need to leave this place. 
 Then I'll tell you something. 
 We're not going anywhere until we contain this thing. 
 When I was a kid, I had a pet goldfish named Copernicus. 
 Are you serious? 
 And he got really sick, some kind of gill infection. 
 And then I woke up one morning and he wasn't in his bowl. 
 That's the day you found your true calling and decided to join the CDC? Damn, Hot Zone, that's a real touching story. 
 Don't call me that. 
 Anyway, I spent a solid week looking for him, which is exactly one week longer than Olivia is gonna spend looking for Soren. 
 How does somebody give up on their own son? 
 Denial? 
 Maybe she just can't admit she's wrong. 
 Maybe. But she knows something. 
 I'm gonna talk to her again. 
 Just be careful. 
 Belief is a slippery slope. 
 Push too hard, she might just take you off the cliff with her. 
 Take a look at this. 
 The skin's raised. 
 It's a puncture wound, but it's too small to be a needle. 
 Could be a bite or a sting. 
 Doesn't fit our profile, but... we might just be looking at an insect-borne vector. 
 Please, Father, you don't have to do this. I want to join the family. I'm ready. 
 But not like this. 
 What about Daniel? He hates me. 
 He's your brother. 
 I'm your real daughter, your flesh and blood. 
 He's threatened by me. You don't wanna risk losing him again. 
 Daniel will never leave. 
 How can you be sure? 
 Dad! 
 I'd love to go fishing, Daniel, but... 
 I'm busy. 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 I've been waiting on the porch for over an hour. 
 Oh, I get it. 
 Pff! Should have known you'd be with her. 
 Daniel, please. I'll take you fishing another time. 
 We made these plans weeks ago. 
 I know it's a perfect day, but there will be more. 
 I promise I will make it up to you. 
 Okay? 
 It's not the same as before. 
 Why don't you go ahead? I'm not going anywhere. 
 Take him fishing. 
 Very well. 
 (cheerful music) 
 Son of a bitch! 
 Alan? 
 What happened? 
 Someone cracked him on the back of the head and then dumped him behind the orchard. 
 It was nothing. If they wanted to kill me, I'd be dead already. 
 Kyle Sommer. 
 Alan Farragut. 
 I know. 
 Heard a lot about you. 
 That could be trouble. 
 Not at all. Sarah speaks highly of you. 
 I gotta get back to the abbey. 
 No. 
 We need your help. 
 I'm not CDC anymore. 
 We have 30 victims, 29 of which are presumed dead. 
 What about the thirtieth? 
 He got better. 
 Blood serum data on the victim  show elevated alkaloid levels, including derivatives of lysergic acid and agroclavine that is consistent with fungal poisoning. 
 Yet, everyone at the abbey is on the same strict diet and only three became mycotic. 
 Mycotic? 
 It's what we call the infected victims. 
 "Myco" for fungus, plus psychotic. 
 Catchy. Any luck with the food testing? 
 Not so far. Stomach contents in all three of our island victims tested negative for any fungal metabolites. 
 Which only means that the source breaks down quickly enough to be undetectable. 
 All three had elevated hemoglobin A1C levels. 
 Yep. 
 Soren and Isaac had quite the sweet tooth. 
 But the diet here is restricted: mainly fruits and vegetables, high fiber/water content, no processed sugars allowed. 
 Sure you guys aren't hiding a cotton candy cart around here somewhere? 
 Soren, Isaac and Travis must have eaten something outside the normal diet. 
 That's likely how they ingested the pathogen. 
 Sarah, go talk to Olivia. Kyle, track down Travis' crew. Maybe one of them caught him sneaking a Kit Kat. 
 I think I'm done here. 
 So that's it? You're outta here? 
 I've done what I can do. 
 I have to get back. 
 This is about Julia, isn't it? 
 About getting her back? 
 When I went to Paris to find Julia, I expected to find a prisoner of Ilaria, not one of its leaders. 
 Julia? That's crazy. 
 Why? She's an immortal now, just like the rest of them. 
 I think Ilaria's behind everything that's happening on this island. 
 What would a multinational corporation want with a bunch of new age farmers? It doesn't make any sense. 
 Any more than immortality itself? NARVIK and mycosis? 
 They're all just symptoms of a bigger sickness. Immortals are the real plague. 
 So you're just gonna kill them all? Including Julia? 
 And how about Sarah? You saving a bullet for her, too? 
 I don't have to explain myself to you. 
 No, of course you don't! 
 'Cause we all know there's no problem the great Alan Farragut can't solve. 
 You know, Peter, it's a lucky thing you found me this morning. 
 Really lucky. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 There are what, over 200 acres inside these walls? 
 And the first one to stumble on me is you. 
 You know what, forget it. I'm sorry I saved your ass. 
 Even with the tiniest nick, they have to be recycled. 
 No good if we can't get an airtight seal. 
 So everything is grown here locally? 
 Every last seed and stem. 
 It seems very... healthy. 
 Michael says the bounty of the earth is ours until master. of the same old thing, though. I mean, when I was a kid, I loved Red Vines. I still do. 
 Soren, he, uh... he must have liked something sweet every in while? 
 Candy? We don't allow that here. 
 Are you sure? 'Cause he had something sweet right before he got sick. 
 You must be mistaken. 
 The blood tests prove it. 
 I know my son, and he would never break the rules. 
 Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself? 
 Soren will return on his own time. 
 What if he doesn't? 
 He will. He packed a bag. He even brought his favorite buddy bear. 
 People are gonna keep getting sick. Soren is the only one who got better and we need to know why. 
 You skeptics think you know everything, but no one was sick before you got here. 
 Maybe you brought the disease from the outside. 
 (sighing) 
 Bonjour. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Why are you calling on an unsecured line? 
 Look, I think Alan suspects something. 
 Did he say something? 
 No, no, he didn't say anything, it's just... he keeps bringing up Ilaria. I need to know. 
 What is going on here? 
 What the hell have you gotten me into? 
 Don't worry, we can deal with Alan. 
 Now, here's what you need to do. 
 Look at this mess. I'm very disappointed in you. 
 (humming) 
 You know, I remember why I know that song. 
 When I was just a little girl, I would hear these angry voices, a man and a woman yelling at each other. 
 It was you and Jaye, arguing about me. 
 I would start crying and you would sing that song to make me stop. 
 Daniel was right about you. 
 (screaming) Daniel isn't here! He's dead! 
 More lies. 
 No, it's true! And Jaye is dead too. 
 They died at Arctic BioSystems. 
 Enough! 
 If you do this, I will die. 
 We are immortal. 
 We live forever. 
 I won't heal from this, you know that's true. 
 Shh, shh... 
 You killed all those people. Please. 
 Please, please, please, you have to remember. Please. 
 I don't want to remember. 
 Please! Ah! (sobbing) 
 (She sings softly) 
 (He joins her) 
 (sobbing, humming) 
 (singing softly) 
 (He kisses her) 
 Please let me hug you. 
 Please, Dad. 
 Julia! 
 And the winner is... toxic! Ooh! 
 Not gonna ask how long you've been standing there. 
 Long enough. 
 What have you got? 
 Honey. 
 Tracked down a massive hive on the north wall. Samples crawling with mycotoxin. 
 Well, it fits the profile. 
 It's high-fructose, ingestible, degrades rapidly... 
 Are the bees carriers? 
 Thankfully, no. 
 Nearly got myself stung. 
 Dammit, Kyle! 
 I'm fine. 
 You're lucky. It's not the same thing. 
 You have good instincts. 
 Had a long time to practice. 
 Not nearly enough. I wish I could have taught you. 
 Ah! 
 Come on, Julia. 
 We should've done this a long time ago. Then maybe I would be free. 
 No. As long as you live, there will always be a part of you that is me. 
 Take it. 
 Please. 
 It is my legacy. 
 What does it mean? 
 Densho. 
 I should have never... made you like me. 
 I'm sorry, Julia. 
 (sobbing) 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay, Father. We're here. 
 We'll never leave you, Hiroshi. 
 Olivia. 
 Just leave me alone. 
 Please, I need to talk to you. 
 You're trying to judge me, trying to blind me to my path. 
 Please, just hear me out. 
 I used to know people like you, people who thought they were better than me. 
 But Michael's opened my eyes so I can be free of your judgment. 
 I just thought you deserved to know the truth. 
 What is this? 
 It's Soren's bear. You said he took it with him. 
 He did. 
 Then why did I find it with another child? 
 I don't believe you. 
 Soren needs his mother right now. 
 Please help me find him. 
 Michael says to each his own... 
 Michael is lying to you! 
 He's lying to everybody! 
 Michael would never do that. 
 The proof is right in front of you! 
 This isn't Soren's bear. You're trying to trick me. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Olivia... Maybe you're the one who took Soren. You did experiments on him. 
 Please, just put the knife down. 
 Maybe you're the ones who are making everyone sick! 
 Ah! 
 (She drops the knife) 
 My baby... 
 (singing softly)
