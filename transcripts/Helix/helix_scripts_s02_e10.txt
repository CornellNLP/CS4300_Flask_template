 Previously on Helix... 
 You're being evacuated. 
 Why? 
 Pathogen is spreading. 
 Make me immortal and you will get your child back. 
 You can try it on me first. 
 (grunting) 
 What's happening? 
 I didn't do anything! 
 You just said goodbye to your baby. 
 We graft all our trees from the original rootstock. 
 We call her Mother. 
 She's gone. 
 Found this in his stomach. 
 That looks like tree sap. 
 Whatever it is, he's been practically living off it. 
 At the very least, we need to go and investigate, see if we can figure out the nature of it. 
 If you leave this room, you are finished with my team. 
 It was never your team, Peter. You were just keeping Alan's chair warm. 
 I'm sorry, Dr. Kyle. 
 For what? 
 What you got there? 
 It's from the Bleeding Tree. 
 The Bleeding Tree? 
 We eat it so we don't get more sick. 
 You're clean. 
 Not anymore. I ate all of it. 
 They're all gonna kill themselves. 
 I really wish you would come to me first. 
 Anne is prone to delusions. 
 We can't believe a word she says. 
 Really? 
 Because she told us that the only way to replicate your apples is by grafting a special rootstock you call Mother. 
 Be honest with me. Why is Mother so important to you? 
 How many dead? Fifty? 
 A hundred? It's nothing. 
 Ilaria believes overpopulation is unsustainable. In three days, they plan to act. I want to present Michael's infertility grafting as an alternative to global genocide. 
 I can't do that without Mother. 
 That's quite a story. 
 It's the truth. 
 How much do you want for Mother? 
 I'm not interested in money. 
 I only want one thing: to see the world through silver eyes. 
 Like Michael and Dr. Jordan... and you. 
 I noticed your contacts the moment you arrived. 
 I can make you immortal. 
 If you can deliver the root. 
 Well... 
 I must first ease concerns among the fellowship. 
 But... we shall reconvene later. 
 In my office? 
 If you're lying, I'll make sure the only world you see is pitch black. 
 We searched every inch. No red sap. 
 We'll do one last sweep of the perimeter, then move out. 
 And the boy, Soren? 
 Considering what he's been through, he's doing okay. 
 Tell your men to keep him close. 
 He's the only one to have fully recovered from the fungus. 
 His immunity might be the key to turning the red sap treatment into an actual cure. 
 How's Dr. Sommer holding up? 
 I'd say he has 48 hours. 
 If that. Soon as I get a SAT signal, we'll call for evac. 
 And the supplies I ordered? 
 Everything you need to take down the disease is in my ship. 
 He'll have a better chance at a real facility. 
 He won't have any chance if we don't find that tree. 
 Dr. Kyle! 
 Dr. Kyle! 
 No! No! 
 Soren, Soren... 
 Don't do that. 
 Come here. 
 Look, Dr. Kyle is not feeling very well right now. 
 Is he all right? 
 We're just being extra careful, all right? I want you to stay away from him until we can get him some of that... that red sap. 
 But why not just bring him to the Bleeding Tree? 
 (bell tolling) 
 I'm so sorry, Landry. I have failed you, just like the others. 
 I should have done more to protect you. 
 And what could you have possibly done? 
 I have to get back to my duties. 
 And... what are those, exactly? 
 Mother is missing, Amy. 
 I'm going to make sure she doesn't fall into the wrong hands. 
 What the hell have we walked into? 
 An outbreak with no cure, a cult with no leader, not to mention an episode of  Family Feud: Sister Wives Edition. 
 I offer Amy carte blanche; what does she want? Immortality. 
 She's not stupid. 
 Worse, she's smart and certifiable. 
 You're not actually going to make her immortal? 
 No, it's impossible. 
 I've tried replicating the science. Every time, my simulation's failed. 
 Last thing the world needs is a Forever Amy. We get what we came for, regardless. 
 Follow her, see if there's anything you can leverage, any kind of weakness. 
 I'm gonna do some digging of my own. 
 Julia. 
 Be careful. 
 You too. 
 I've looked everywhere! Mother's not here! 
 You're angry. I can understand that. 
 Can you, Anne? 
 Because I've been searching all night, and all I've got to show for it is bags under my eyes. 
 What if Mother is lost? 
 Or destroyed? 
 Then I'd say our deal is void. 
 Julia. 
 Could you please give us a minute, Anne? 
 You're done, Peter. No reward, nothing. 
 We're not finished searching yet. 
 Do you even have a plan? Or are you going to comb the entire abbey one room at a time? 
 I will find Mother. You have my word. 
 The word of a traitor? 
 Ha! I'm a traitor?! 
 You're a member of the Ilaria board! Once a hypocrite... 
 You sold me out to the highest bidder. Betrayed me to that monster who slit my mother's throat. 
 Now I'm on the inside, trying to change their tactics. 
 How could I have been so wrong? 
 I threw away my marriage for you. 
 Deny all you want. 
 I loved you, Julia. 
 And I thought you were a good man until I realized there's nothing inside. 
 You're hollow, Peter. 
 Words have meaning, Dr. Walker. 
 They carry weight. 
 Amy told me you were delusional, not to trust anything you say. 
 Amy will say anything to get what she wants. 
 Let me guess. She told you she has Mother. 
 My daughter is a liar. Oh. Only three people were charged with Mother's care: Michael, myself... 
 Who's the third? 
 My son. 
 Landry. 
 Where's Mother, Landry? 
 I know you've hidden her. 
 You need to tell me where she is. 
 Show me a sign. Anything. 
 I can feel you staring at me. 
 Like when we were kids, remember? Trying to get a peek up my dress? 
 This is no time for games. 
 I need your help. Tell me. 
 Where's Mother, Landry? 
 Just blink once if you understand. 
 Wake up!! 
 Wake up! You need to wake up! 
 You useless piece of sh1t! 
 Disgusting. I hope you've had time to reflect on your careless actions. 
 I did everything that you asked me to. You promised to... 
 You failed! Look at him! He can't even talk! 
 And I need to talk to him. 
 I can't treat him unless I can diagnose what's wrong, and I can't do that unless I have an EEG or a CTCN... 
 You're boring me. Just fix him. 
 It doesn't work like that! 
 Then I see no reason for keeping you or your child alive. 
 You need us. We're your only link to immortality. 
 Not anymore. I happened to find a new immortal much more interesting. 
 What new immortal? 
 Perhaps you know her. 
 Julia Walker. 
 Just fix him! 
 Amy... Amy... 
 Landry was always willing to go beyond what was required. 
 He was responsible for Michael's protection... his person as well as his research. 
 He knew Mother was essential. I'm sure he has her in a safe place. 
 What are you doing? Landry! 
 Hello, Sarah. 
 Bad practice, sneaking up on people. 
 You followed me first. 
 Those who give must also be willing to take. 
 And those who make promises must also be able to deliver. Understand? 
 Make me understand. 
 I only take orders from Dr. Walker. 
 Shame to waste so much aggression on someone who can't even feel it. 
 Do not talk about her that way. 
 You really care about her. 
 Have you cared about all of them each in their different way? 
 You know who I don't care about? 
 You. 
 Unless you've got the Mother root. 
 The abbey is an extension of my being. 
 All I have to do is look deep enough and I'll find her. 
 You lied to us. 
 Do you want me to find Mother or not? 
 Be a good boy. Let me go look. 
 Wherever you go, I go. Like a shadow. 
 For a moment, I thought you were him. 
 The way the light would catch his hair. 
 But... then I remembered. 
 Michael is gone. 
 Maybe he has the right idea. 
 Whatever prevents Michael from being here, I assure you it's not to be envied. 
 Anything would be better than this. 
 I came here to lead an investigation, and now I'm... persona non grata on my own team. 
 Change is inevitable. 
 What I don't understand is why you allow Dr. Walker to speak to you that way. 
 We all say things we don't mean. 
 We always say what we mean at the time we say it. 
 Do you think she has a right to judge you? 
 I broke up her marriage to my brother. 
 Or was the affair merely a result of his failings? 
 No. I drove them apart. I don't deserve their forgiveness. 
 You don't need their forgiveness. 
 You're a brilliant doctor, a great man. 
 You have no idea what kind of man I am. 
 Hell, I'm not even sure myself sometimes. 
 I see you, Peter. 
 I see what your path could be. 
 If only you could see it for yourself. 
 You don't know how the outside world works. 
 Perhaps not. 
 But I know human nature. Those who are meant to lead are never satisfied to follow. 
 (deep sigh) 
 So what's so important about this root? 
 You're missing the point. Mother is a means to an end. 
 It's not so much what Mother is... as why. 
 So tell me. 
 The truth can be unforgiving. Are you certain? 
 Don't play games with me, Anne. 
 It's not a game. 
 It's very dangerous. 
 For both of us. 
 I've only got 72 hours until Ilaria releases the new NARVIK-C. 
 What could Ilaria possibly have to gain? 
 They're not looking to profit in the short term. 
 It's about restoring balance for the future. 
 The board believes that... 
 The board! Julia, do you hear yourself? 
 I'm doing everything in my power to change this, Sarah. 
 Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization? 
 Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate, just until resources are replenished. 
 You think you know better, but you don't have the right to make that choice. No one does. 
 We're going to be on this planet for centuries. 
 We have a responsibility to do something. 
 You sound just like one of them. 
 One of us. 
 I'm not one of anything. 
 (Sighing) 
 When NARVIK is released, there will be no stopping it this time. 
 Within a few weeks, the CDC as you know it won't exist. 
 Bodies will pile up in every major city. You will lose everyone, Sarah. 
 Friends, family... 
 You've seen NARVIK up close. 
 I know you care about stopping this outbreak more than anything. 
 Actually, there's something I care about more. 
 Is Dr. Kyle gonna be okay? 
 I hope so, Soren. 
 Are we getting closer to the red sap tree? 
 I think so. 
 I only went a few times. 
 Just get us there, okay? I'll take care of Dr. Kyle. 
 All right. 
 What's that smell? You smell that, Sommer? 
 I don't smell anything. 
 Stinks real bad. Like you! 
 What d'you say? 
 Singsong : Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 I don't stink. 
 Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 Shut up. 
 Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 Just shut up! 
 Shut up! Shut up! No! 
 Shut up! No! No! 
 No! Stop it! 
 I'm so sorry Sarah, are you ok? 
 I can't stop thinking about what happened to me. It won't do him any good. 
 Now do you see? I have to get him back. 
 He'll be frozen like that. Forever. 
 I'm his mother, Julia. I'll find a way for him to grow. 
 I hope you do. 
 What about the father? Does he know about all of this? 
 Yeah, Alan knows. 
 Alan? 
 Yeah. 
 Where is he now? 
 He's out there, looking for the cure. 
 Hm. Same old Alan. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh... 
 What? 
 Look. 
 Oh my God, it's leaking! 
 Where... where's the crack? I don't see it. 
 I- t's hard to tell. 
 This equipment is ancient. Oh my God, he's gonna die. 
 Not if we can figure out a way to give Amy what she wants. 
 With what? Look where we are. 
 The lab is outdated, but we'll make do with what we have. 
 It's impossible. 
 And who better than the two of us to figure it out? 
 Us? 
 Look, we're both desperate and we're running out of time. 
 You want your baby and I want Mother. 
 Either we can fail alone, or we can both get what we want by working together. 
 (door banging) 
 All right, ladies and gentlemen, five more minutes. Use them well. We got one hour of daylight left. 
 So we move in the search to higher ground. 
 That'll give us a chance to pick up a SAT signal. 
 
 
 
 Dr. Kyle, are you hungry? 
 The flavor's oatmeal. 
 Come on, eat some. It's good. 
 Eat it! Come on, stinky Sommer, eat it! 
 Don't call me that. 
 Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 Smell that? Smells like sh1t. 
 all : Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! Eats his way out bit by bit! 
 Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 Eats his way out bit by bit! Stinky Sommer rolls in sh1t! 
 No, don't! No, don't! 
 Kyle, Kyle, Kyle! 
 Kyle. 
 (gagging) 
 Kyle, what you're seeing isn't real. 
 All right? Can you hear me? 
 We need to get to that high ground. 
 Where are you taking me, Anne? 
 Just a little farther... 
 (grunting) 
 Oh! 
 Jesus! Do you need a moment? 
 No. 
 The boneyard out in the woods. 
 All those skulls without teeth. 
 The vessel must be prepared to receive the offering. 
 Vessel? Are you talking about human beings? 
 All will become clear, Peter. 
 But in order to hear the truth, you first must speak your own truth. 
 Anne? Anne? 
 Found something. 
 Take a guess. I'm not playing games. 
 Come on... 
 Aren't you even a little curious? 
 (sighing) 
 Ow! 
 You're hurting me. 
 (laughing) 
 You try that again and I will slice your pretty little throat. 
 Okay. On to the next. 
 We got signal! We got com! 
 (static noise) 
 Manitou. 
 Manitou, this is Humphries. 
 Manitou, switch and answer, three one. 
 Over. 
 Manitou, this is Humphries. Switch and answer, three one. Over. 
 [Mayday... Manitou. We are overrun.] 
 [Repeat: mayday, we're overrun.] 
 Manitou, this is Lieutenant Commander Winger. 
 I need a sitrep. 
 [Everyone's sick.] 
 [Can't hold the... ] 
 (garbled) 
 [They're gonna kill us all! No!] 
 (gunshots) 
 (gunshots, screaming) 
 Manitou, this is Winger. Manitou, do you copy? 
 Man : [We all sound the same underwater.] 
 [We all sound the same underwater.] 
 [We all sound the same... ] 
 How the hell this disease is spreading so fast. 
 Any number of ways. 
 My cutter... Has it gone airborne? 
 Screw this! We gotta get back to the ship. 
 Stow it, Lieutenant. 
 We were given orders to evac the CDC, not follow some one-eyed kid to a magic tree! 
 That kid might be the key to saving all our lives! 
 And there is no ship. 
 Not anymore. They're all dead. 
 Dr. Farragut is right. We need to regroup and find that tree. 
 whispering : Hey! Hey, Soren! 
 You still got that power bar? 
 Yeah. 
 Mmm! 
 That's delicious. 
 Now I'm thirsty. Can you bring me my bag? 
 I'd better ask Commander Winger first. 
 Oh, she's real busy. Too busy for us. 
 Come on, it's just a drink of water. 
 Hey, maybe you're getting better, like I did. 
 You're starting to sound like the old Dr. Kyle. 
 Do I? 
 Yeah. 
 So if the old Dr. Kyle asked for just one of his hands free so he could drink his own water? 
 Um... 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. There you go. 
 Ah! Help! Please, help me! 
 Get him! Go, go, go! 
 ♪♪♪ 
 We know the immortality gene is the same in all of us, so why did the CSF transfer work from me to you and not you to Landry? 
 I thought my spinal fluid was different from yours, but they're identical. 
 What if it wasn't the difference in the cells themselves, but the timing of the transfer? 
 There's this study that came out of Berkeley linking embryonic cells to breakthrough cell regeneration. 
 Right, how stem cells specialize over time to create various tissues in the body. 
 When I got your spinal fluid, you had only been an immortal for a few days. 
 Your cells had yet to specify the RNA chain. 
 And once immortal DNA is transcribed in RNA... 
 Those mature cells are no longer transferrable. 
 Yes. 
 That's why your CSF couldn't be transferred. 
 You weren't a brand new immortal. 
 If we could figure out a way to somehow reverse the specificity... 
 We could give Amy immortality. 
 (chuckling) 
 You know, you really are being wasted at the CDC. 
 You should be running your own lab. 
 Unlimited funding, cutting edge equipment... gloves off. 
 Ilaria? 
 Why not? 
 There's not enough funding in the world. 
 Anne? 
 What the hell is this? 
 Anne : I'm going to ask you a question, Peter. 
 It's important that you answer honestly. No more lies. 
 Do we have to do this in the dark? 
 There can be no distractions. 
 Now tell me... what do you want? 
 I want you to turn on the light, Anne. 
 What... do you... want? 
 Ah! 
 Look, you're gonna have to give me a little more than that. 
 One word. 
 The one thing you want above all else. 
 I want to be happy. I want to be fulfilled. 
 I don't know, Anne, I want a goddamn golden toilet. 
 You're lying. If you're not ready to face your truth... 
 No, no. 
 No, I'm ready. 
 Okay. 
 I want... respect. 
 I want you to think, Peter. 
 When was the time you felt the most respected? 
 I don't know. 
 When I was made team leader at the CDC. 
 You're lying again. That's someone else's work. 
 What is  your  truth? 
 I don't know! I'm not lying. 
 I'm not lying to you. 
 Worse. You're lying to yourself. 
 Think. When did you feel the most respected? 
 I told you, when I... 
 Remember a time when you had what you wanted. When you felt complete. 
 When you weren't hiding or lying. When you were yourself. 
 I can't. 
 You can. Stop hiding. 
 Accept your truth. 
 When I was sick. 
 With NARVIK. 
 They all came to me. 
 I didn't have to say a word and they all listened to me. 
 (door creaking) 
 Where are we going? 
 One of Landry's old hiding spots. 
 We used to play here when we were children. 
 That's hard to imagine. 
 What? That we were allowed to play up here? 
 No. That you were ever a little kid. 
 (screaming) 
 (screaming) 
 (sighing) 
 What's taking Balleseros so long? 
 Don't worry. He may get sidetracked, but he always comes through. 
 It's not like we have anything to give to Amy anyway. 
 We're running out of time and she's gonna kill my son. 
 Let me talk to her. Alone. 
 No. No. 
 You're too emotionally invested. 
 You said you wanted to do this together so I'm coming with you. 
 (door opening) 
 Amy will see you now. 
 And who are you? 
 That's the bitch that stabbed me. 
 Stand down. Stand down! 
 Copy that. Stand down. Secure your weapons. 
 Dr. Sommer, let the boy go. 
 Why do you hate me? 
 Why? 
 I don't hate you! 
 Please! 
 Let me try to talk to him. 
 Too risky. 
 If you and your guys go in there, we'll lose them both. 
 I won't let you hurt me. 
 I won't let you hurt anyone! 
 Please, don't! 
 (Anne): At some point, you must decide what kind of man you want to be. 
 One who fears, or one who inspires fear. Which man are you, Peter? Are you ready to lead? (woman panting) Now I can finally share my truth with you. (hissing) (baby crying) (baby crying) What is this? Some kind of... experiment? (woman panting) I was an experiment. As were Amy and Agnes and all those who came before us. I was one in a long line of failures. It was Michael's dream to breed an immortal companion. What you see are those who refused his call. (hissing) They were brought here, stripped of all non-essentials... (panting) Like teeth. Unnecessary. We didn't want them to chew through their feeding tubes. They became pure vessels. (screeching) And once they bore Michael a child, he would end their path. Mother... Michael... the fellowship... it's not about propagating family. It's about control. Respect. True leaders will make you believe that their ideas are your own. That their way... is the only way. (Alan): It may not feel like it, but you always have choices. When we were young, we believed everything everybody told us, even those who hurt us. But someone hurt them too. And it's not true that you have to hurt others first to survive. There is another way. There is no other way! Why can't I make them like me? Why? They're afraid that you'll discover the truth. That no matter what they've done, you still decide what happens next. Don't make the mistake I did. Don't hold on to the past, become the thing you hate. Show them they have no power. All right? Walk away. How do I know they won't follow me? You don't. (Soren sobbing) There it is! The tree! (Anne): Only you can decide your path. Leader... (baby crying) Leaders don't have to say a word and everyone listens. Will you lead, Peter? Will you choose who lives? (baby crying) (baby crying) I'm not seeing any happy smiling faces. I kept up my end of the bargain. And we have a plan to keep up ours. A promising new theory. I don't care about your theories. You know what I want. These things don't happen overnight. We need more time or you'll never get what you want. Sarah. And yet it worked for the two of you. I'm not stupid. Evidence to the contrary. Then I guess you won't be needing this anymore. Wait! What are you doing? Stop it! Say goodbye to your son! Wait! You don't want to do that. And why not? Because that baby is the key to giving you immortality. What? The child's DNA has been frozen in time. Genes normally pass genetic traits onto offspring, but in this case, we can engineer the reverse. Julia, what are you talking about? How does it work? Another spinal thing? No. We'll have to implant the baby into your uterus. No! No, no, no! You can't! No! Julia, you liar! No, you can't! It's my baby! I'm going to be a mother? No!! What are you doing? No! No, you can't! No! No!
