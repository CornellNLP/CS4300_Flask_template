 Previously on  Helix... 
 This is Dr. Hiroshi Hatake, director of research. 
 Jane! 
 I love you, father. 
 Daniel! 
 The most likely scenario is some sort of infection contracted from the island. 
 St. Germain. 
 We need to go there. You should know you're trespassing on private property. I'm Michael. Welcome. (screaming) Be my path. Stop it. Stop! Thirty years ago, a pandemic began here on this island. Soren. (Grunting) Somebody help her! Alan's here. He's on the island. Can I speak with you, brother... Jerome. Get Peter and the other guy and get the hell out. I'm still pregnant. I've been pregnant for the last 15 months. Hey, Soren. How are you feeling? Good, I guess. You found what you were looking for? No. Does this mean anything to you? It's a map of the island. What's this right here? A place you don't wanna go. Landry, what are you doing? Hello. (Screaming) CDC doctors are... anxious, they're... They're concerned about the disappearance. Do they have anything to be concerned about? What's done is done. Isaac and Soren have... completed their paths. Good. And Michael? He blames Ann, he... He's afraid she's... losing control. My mother's control is an illusion, one we must keep providing for her. Of course. What if she finds out... about us? There is no us, Landry. I've told you many, many times. I misspoke. Forgive me. I think one of the scientists has taken a liking to me. The cute one, Kyle. It seems the CDC is becoming a distraction for us all. We can't have that. (Moaning) No... No distractions. It would be terrible if something unexpected were to happen to them. Say it, Landry. (moaning) Say it! Something unexpected... a terrible... (gasping and moaning) I'd say it's about time we took matters into our own hands. Wouldn't you? (birds chirping) (man singing) (singing) Saw a mess of deer tracks near the creek base. Looks like they were moving at a pretty good clip. Something's got 'em spooked. Feel free to turn up the radio. Oh, right, we don't have one. Jaye likes it when I sing, don't you, Jaye? It has a certain resonance that reminds me of singing. Father, someone's coming. Inside. Both of you. Michael! Where is Soren? Soren is gone? The boy, yeah. He's missing. From your care? I thought you had him under quarantine. (sighing) We... need a coordinated search of the grounds. I don't have the manpower. Done. Do you know what I love about plant grafting? The precision. The attention to detail. If the angles of the cut don't line up just right, the plant fails. Not enough humidity, and the scion won't flower. But with practice, plums on peach trees. Tomatoes grow in the snow. If only it were so easy with people. Unfortunately, the results are far less reliable once you add free will into the mix. I didn't come here for Botany 101. Well then, anything else? No. That's all for now. But if I find out you're behind Soren's disappearance, I will hold you both responsible. Are we? Absolutely not. The boy was placed in their care. Alone, without the balance of our family to reassure him. They wrapped him in plastic. I wouldn't blame him for running off. We haven't been seeing eye to eye lately. Unfamiliar territory for us, no? My only thought is of what we have here and how to protect it. That's what I want too. Sometimes, though, it helps to have fresh eyes on the situation, don't you think? Of course, but... I think we should just call this a... difference of opinion. Sweet Ann. I don't know what I'd do without you. (bells tolling) Testing to isolate and identify the pathogen continues. Specimen A is a patient with no known toxic exposure, adult male, 32 years old, approximately 175 pounds. More like 160. Been watching the carbs. (sighing) Additional lyses were used to test for the presence of known toxins against the samples taken from the St. Germain subject, juvenile male, 10 years old, approximately 95 pounds, both during the symptomatic window and after remission. Samples failed to yield a result. This is like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon. It could take weeks to make an identification without an ICP-MS. IC what? (sighing) Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Why didn't you say so, Hot Zone? Oh, please don't call me that. Let's try something different. Soren exhibited the same symptoms as the ship victims, right? Ulcerating sores, scleral icterus... that's the yellow eyes for those of you playing at home. What if we match Soren's samples to the ship victims'? That way, we can... That way, we can use competitive binding and find a match. Huh! It might actually work. OK, where are the ship samples? Right here. Wait a minute. Where are they? What's wrong? They're not here. What's not here? The samples. Where did you last see them? In the shack, when we found Layla's body. They must have fallen out. You're kidding, right? Those samples were everything. We can't confirm the pathogen without them! I'll fix it. What happened? Boy Wonder here left the samples back at the shack. I'll get them back. Hold on. We'll go. Sarah, grab a field pack. No, this is on me. I should go. I need you here. You've developed a rapport with Amy. That's one way of putting it. OK. Use it. Find out if Soren was acting strangely before he attacked his mother. Narrow down the symptomatic window. See if you can find our missing kid. Hey. (birds chirping) I knew they would send someone. I did not think it would be you. It's not what you think. A lot has changed since we last saw each other, father. Not as much as I would have hoped. Ilaria is gone. I was wrong to trust them. I know that now. You and I... we're on the same side. The immortals have scattered to the winds. Our time is over. The TXM-7 pandemic is destroying us. I just wanna save the few who are left. Tell me why I should believe you. Because I'm here. Unarmed. Believe what you want. Hurry up those barrels. Got a lot of work to do. Everything okay, Jerome? Yeah, fine. Why? You've raked the same spot three times now. I was just thinking how much I miss having a drink every once in a while. That's your past life talking. Don't worry, there's no alcohol on the island. Michael forbids it. What's with the wine barrels then? No idea, except it's not wine. What then? Better not to ask. As Michael says, embrace your own path, not your neighbor's. Amy, hey. About yesterday... I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea. (scoffing) How can an idea be wrong? There's no substance to it, just... air. If I hurt your feelings, it wasn't my intention. (laughing) That's what skeptics don't understand about us. We're free to explore our actions or reactions without blame or fear. Our actions to others, others to us. We don't limit our bodies or our thoughts. We use the space we've created here to explore the darkness. Test it. We find the light. What if all you found was more darkness? That's just another discovery. Is it like that for the children? Of course. The children are the most free. I'm sorry you haven't found the answers you're looking for yet. I usually find them one way or another. Still. It must be difficult for you. Not really. You see, the CDC is real good at exploring the darkness. We have very bright flashlights. Right now, I'd like to turn that light on your children. What's your name, sweetheart? Elizabeth, but everybody calls me Lizzy. Did you know Soren, Lizzy? He was in my class, but not anymore. That day, before he went away, was he acting kind of strange? He said he was scared. Soren's feeling much better now, Lizzy. We talked about that. OK, Lizzy, this won't hurt a bit. Can you open your mouth for me? Like this: ahh... (laughing) Maybe not quite like that. What was Soren scared about? I can't say if Amy's gonna tell... She won't, I promise. He said he broke a rule. He didn't want to go in the pit. What rule? What's the pit? That should so it. Take care now. Next. Keep moving. We don't want to be out here any longer than we have to. Seemed like a much better idea inside the giant electrified gates. Well, the sooner we get to the shack, the sooner we get back inside. You know, I'm not so sure it's that much safer inside. Alan said that the... Dammit, Sarah, you tried to talk sense into him, he told you to run. He's manipulating you. He knows something about what's going on on this island. You know what's going on here? A CDC investigation, and Alan is no longer a part of that. Why shouldn't he be? We should bring him on. You still think he's gonna ride in and save the day. I don't need saving, Peter. I'm a scientist and I use my resources, and one of our best is wasting his time picking apples and raking leaves. You have no idea what he's up to. Neither do I. And that's a good thing. How can you say that? He's your brother. He killed people, Sarah. In Paris. After Arctic BioSystems, he became obsessed. He couldn't think of anything but Julia. I've heard the rumors. It's more than rumors. Interpol has security cam footage of him leaving Ilaria's corporate headquarters just before a bomb went off. Maybe he thought he was creating a diversion, maybe he didn't expect people to be there, but they were. Innocent people. Immortals. Immortals. Just like you. Alan's not the man he used to be, and it's time we all face that. Lock it. Wouldn't get too close. What is that? Seraphim's breath. The Mayans used it in human sacrifice. One whiff, and people would literally cut their own throats. Funny, isn't it? Nature gives us free will, and then it gives us the ability to take it away. Michael and Ann know about this? Of course not. They're afraid of anything they can't control. Maybe they should be a little more friendly, hmm? What do I do with this? (children laughing) Children. Children! Gather round. Who wants to play a game? I do! What's it called? Time machine. Who wants to go first? All : Me! OK, Lizzy. Just breathe, Lizzy. Who wants to go next? All : Me! 
 
 Layla's body's gone. You don't suppose somebody came from the abbey to pick it up and then never got around to telling us, do you? Somebody definitely came to get it, but I don't think it was anyone from the abbey. I've found the samples. You know, the competitive binding idea that Kyle had was really inspired. Hopefully it will give us some clues. (loud banging) (growling) Hey, come on! (banging and growling) I can smell you right now!! Get the samples! (screaming and banging) Come on! The window! (growling furiously) Go, go, go! (growling) Fresh meat! (gunshots) Come on, come on! She can't be trusted. You know that, right? She's my daughter. Part of me is happy to see her. And the other part? She betrayed us once. Much time has passed. You don't see clearly where she's concerned, you never have. I know what she is. I made her that way. You know what you have to do. I don't need a lecture from you. I will discover her true intentions. Then what? Then... I will do what is necessary. I'm glad you finally found some peace. Last time we saw each other, that wasn't the case. Finding peace is very difficult. Especially for our kind. You've been on this island a long time. There isn't much peace to be had these days. For anyone. Then I'm lucky to pass my days here. You still find immortality lucky? Why else would I have given it to you? I sometimes wish you hadn't. It doesn't matter. You are here now. You drugged me. Why is Soren's blood sugar so high? Dr. Kyle! Lizzy? What's wrong? Come quick! The children are sick. Please, hurry. Where are the children? Lizzy? ♪♪♪ Lizzy? What's wrong? ♪ I think I'll go for a walk outside now ♪ Hey, kids. ♪ I hear you now, I just can't stay inside all day ♪ ♪ I gotta get out, get me some of those rays ♪ What are you guys doing out here? ♪ Everybody's laughing Sunshine day ♪ ♪ Everybody seems so happy today ♪ ♪ It's a sunshine day ♪ ♪ I think I'll go for a walk outside now ♪ ♪ The summer sun knows me by name, he's calling me ♪ Can I help you with something? Yeah, I was told to bring these here. By who? This isn't produce storage? You want the red building. Other side of the orchard. Oh! (chuckling) I'm new to the picking crew. I thought they said here. Well, they were wrong. You told us there were bears out there, not people! I'm sure there's a simple explanation. Whatever you think you saw... Don't try to tell me that you don't know what's going on on your goddamn island! Peter... It's Dr. Farragut. I'm only trying to tell you that there are no creatures outside. It wasn't a creature, it was a man. A very sick man who was exhibiting stage-2 symptoms of the pathogen, along with necrotic lesions. It's like ergot poisoning, a fungal toxin that produces psychosis along with severe physical symptoms. How could you not tell us there are people in the woods? Well... some people choose to leave the abbey. They come because they're tired of living dishonest lives, but if they reject their true path, often there's nowhere for them to return. So you just throw them out to fend for themselves? No one is thrown out. I only help them see that they are their decisions. Once made, they have to live with them. Or die by them? If that's their path. Based on what we saw, the pathogen is outside  the gates. The question is: where did it come from? You're assuming it started outside. How's that? What if it was the other way around? You think the source is inside the abbey? They're doing some pretty heavy duty botanical work here. Hybrid breeding, seed manipulation... they're combining traits of different plants to create entirely new variants. You mean like GMOs? They don't have the technology... They don't need it. Grafting's been around for centuries. Gregor Mendel was crossbreeding pea plants in the 1850s, at an abbey not unlike this one. Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Kyle! Kyle, can you hear me? Kyle! We need to get him on his back. Come on, buddy. Airway clear, breathing normal. There's so much blood. We've got to find the source. Here. Hey! Kyle, come on, buddy! Sunshine day. Kyle, it's Peter. What happened? How long have I been out? I don't know. My head is killing me. You've got a nasty laceration. Ow! Payback's a bitch. Who did this to you? You wouldn't believe it if I told you. Hell, I don't believe it. The kids. The kids? All of them, acting together. They left me for dead and I dragged myself back here. I've seen angry mobs before. This was something else. They were... blank. Like a trance? Maybe some kind of brainwashing. Cults are notorious for their mind control techniques. Their eyes... the pupils were darting side to side. Quick, repetitive movements. Nystagmus, an involuntary nerve condition. Where are the kids now? Don't know, why? I'd like to see them for myself. (whimpering) (humming) Good. You're awake. My arm... what... what did you... It's sodium pentothal. What? Why? You should have told me the truth. Julia? Hm... Tell me: why are you here? A cure. For what? Immortals dying. That's not possible. I'm dying. Julia? Hm... Julia. Tell me who you work for. Hm... Julia! Who do you work for? Ilaria. (children laughing and talking) They seem fine. Dr. Kyle! What happened? Did you get hurt? One minute they attack me with rocks, and the next, they wanna kick a ball around? Soren experienced a similar recovery from the pathogen. I'm telling you, this was different. What could have caused that kind of attack? I don't know. Likely, somebody wants us off this island. Permanently. Right there. There it is. You get something? Lower left quadrant, 400x. It's definitely a fungus. Not one I've ever seen before. Which means that we have no idea what it's capable of. We need to bring Alan in on this. Whoa, no, no! No, we talked about this. Alan... Farragut? He's handled hundreds of investigations. He's here? On the island? He's here. Pretending to be one of the followers. The last thing we need is another variable, and Alan is just that. We need all the help we can get. Not his kind of help. We've got a limited time to get a handle on this, or a lot more people are gonna die. With Alan, at least we have a chance. OK. But let me talk to him first. Alone. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah, my eyes! What is it? My eyes! Someone help me! What's happening, brother? (shouting) (muffled): do what is necessary. How? You need to trust me to do what is right. The decision is mine! Stay out of sight. I will decide what to do. Daniel, don't be so dramatic! You know I'm right. What are you waiting for? It's more complicated than that. Isn't it, Hiroshi? You said you'd do what you had to do. It's time. I do not want to discuss this now. Go ahead, tell him. Tell me what? You're choosing her? Again? Bringing you here is proof enough. You are my son. And she is our daughter. We can make her understand. She's a strong woman, but she'd burn down the house to clean the stove. We can make her see there's another way. Don't do this, Hiroshi. She doesn't belong here. (gasping) I thought you'd never wake up. What is this? Where are my clothes? You look very pretty. Are you ready? You were right to come to me. I can save you. But first, meet your family. What family? There's no one here. Say hello to your mother and brother
