 Previously on Helix... 
 This is my brother Peter. 
 I've got a reply for that message! 
 Whatever Balleseros is up to has everything to do with this virus. 
 But I want him found. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Anana. 
 Thirty-one missing kids over the past two decades, all within 200 miles of Arctic Biosystems and your precious Dr. Hatake. 
 This is where I left him. 
 He's been taken. 
 This is me and my brothers. Twins. 
 This is Miksa. He disappeared when we were kids. 
 Where's Miksa now? 
 You tell me, you son of a bitch. 
 Don't worry, Julia. We'll have you back on your feet in no time. 
 (screaming) 
 (helicopters flying) 
 Incoming flight. 
 Incoming flight. 
 Whoa. 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 You know, what we did was... 
 Under the circumstances... 
 The work is really what's important. 
 It was perfectly... 
 Fine. It's fine. 
 Yeah. 
 What we did was biology. I'm OK. Really. 
 Okay. 
 System voice :  Incoming flight. 
 Fine. I am too. 
 What do you think? Good or bad? 
 Considering we never got the call out, probably bad. 
 Definitely bad. 
 Military? 
 No. 
 My corporate patrons. 
 Hold your weapons. Sir. 
 Dr. Farragut, isn't it? It's so nice to finally meet you. 
 I'm Constance Sutton, the Chief Operating Officer of the Ilaria Corporation, parent company of Arctic Biosystems. 
 I'm here for one reason only: to help you. 
 The first thing I need is a working line to the CDC. 
 Am I to understand that the communication satellite went down? 
 Unfortunately, I don't have a magic telephone. 
 I'm under the same constraints as everyone at this base. 
 What about your helicopters? 
 They're out of range already. 
 They'll be back in two days' time. I'm afraid you're stuck with me and my boys until then, Doctor. 
 Two hours in a helicopter. Ouch. 
 I'm sorry you had a rough journey. 
 So, Alan, how goes the search for a cure? 
 Slowly. - Hence the fact that I am here wearing combat boots. 
 But it's time for us to create a new paradigm between our corporation and the CDC, so what do you need from Ilaria to contain this terrible disease? 
 An integral member of my team, uh, Dr. Walker, is trapped down on Level R. I need her back. 
 Impossible. 
 Dr. Hatake, please. Let's square the circle here. 
 Dr. Walker, why is she locked up? 
 She's infected. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 She's an expert in RNA structure. 
 And that's important because...? 
 RNA carries the message. We store the instructions for the cure in the DNA, and then the RNA passes it on, and that makes her the most important member of my team. 
 Well, Ilaria is about value-add. 
 If Dr. Walker is what you need, Dr. Walker is what you will get. 
 Lieutenant Klein, let's prepare a plan to retrieve Dr. Walker. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Alan, one thing. One thing only: a cure. 
 Please. 
 Now, Dr. Hatake, may we have a word? 
 In private, if you don't mind. 
 Constance. 
 Hiroshi. 
 Two things, Hiroshi! Two simple things. 
 That's all we needed. 
 I created your virus... 
 Where is the cure?! 
 Virus and cure. 
 One without the other is meaningless. We don't want to kill everybody. just thin the herd a bit. 
 And rule them. 
 It's time. We've waited long enough. 
 You know that. 
 There have been a few setbacks. 
 You failed. 
 Thank God the CDC arrived to do your job for you. 
 For you. 
 What is this other strain that I'm hearing about? 
 NARVIK-B, the one that turns people into... 
 An alternate attempt at the virus. 
 Why? 
 The cure has been elusive in the A strain. 
 Perhaps the B strain... 
 Perhaps you are full of sh1t, Hiroshi. 
 It's the Willis hypothesis. 
 We said no then. Nothing has changed. 
 Virus and cure. 
 Simple. 
 Do you really plan to go down to Level R? 
 To get this Walker? Yes. 
 If Dr. Farragut needs her, he gets her. 
 The cure is in his hands now. 
 And then? 
 And then we follow normal null protocol no witnesses. 
 These people are my employees, my responsibility. 
 No one gets out alive, Hiroshi. You knew that before we started. 
 What about the CDC? If they fail to return? 
 We have people in place to control such things. 
 And if I... find out that you betrayed us... the only thing left of you or this facility will be a blackened scar on the ice. 
 Now say it. 
 Say it. 
 No one gets out alive. 
 Agh! Come on! Please? 
 Begging? Thought you military guys were tough. 
 Just one hand even, so I can hold on. 
 No. 
 How much farther? 
 Far. 
 "Far!" 
 Are you mocking me? 
 Would you prefer I sang "One Hundred Bottles of Beer?" 
 I'd rather you shut your mouth! 
 Well, then untie me, and I promise you won't hear a word. 
 Or I could just speed up, you fall off, and then I won't have to hear you yapping. 
 I like my plan better. 
 We need to talk. 
 About... about Sutton. 
 What about her? 
 I don't think she's telling us everything. not with what Hatake's been putting us through. 
 What do you mean? 
 What I mean is I don't think our agenda is her agenda. 
 Right. Where's the profit in sending Sutton and her private army up here? 
 Especially when we're already cleaning up their mess for free. 
 Big pharma. 
 You know they're only interested in the bottom line. 
 They don't really want to help people. 
 And who knows how far they'll go to protect their investment? 
 We can't stop working on a cure. 
 No, too many lives at stake. 
 But we do not work for Sutton. 
 We keep the cure from her. 
 We may need it. 
 Ah! 
 Ah! 
 Ah! Ahhh! Ah! 
 (yelling in agony) 
 Daniel. 
 Hatake's adopted son. 
 Though on some level you do realize that we pay your salary, yes? 
 So you've already bought me. 
 Paid for excellent service, rather. 
 Did you have a chance to meet this Dr. Walker? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm feeling some pushback, Daniel, and I'm extremely busy, so I need a quick win on this one, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I need full intel on Walker before I return her to Dr. Farragut, and... well, let's be honest, Hiroshi is not gonna tell me anything. 
 There's not much to tell. 
 I like you, Daniel, and I don't want to start our relationship with you lying to me. 
 I wasn't aware that we had a relationship. 
 Loyalty I understand. Hell, I even admire it. 
 So let's skip the negatives and get straight to the positives, shall we? 
 You are very good at your job. 
 And Hatake is not gonna be in charge of this place forever. 
 Just think on it, Daniel. Please. 
 Hiroshi has destroyed everyone who's ever been close to him. 
 Don't let him do the same to you. 
 Handy. 
 The US military abandoned 67 of these early-warning stations across the Arctic. Someone should put them to use. 
 How about untying my hands? 
 You need your hands to sleep? 
 You've got the gun. 
 Yeah, you make a good point. 
 I'm just saying. 
 Let's be reasonable. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 It's reasonable to hogtie you. 
 Make sure you don't get any ideas about running off. - Aw, come on! 
 I need to get back upstairs. I need to get to Alan. My blood could have antibodies that fight the virus. There's a guy in Australia. 
 His blood plasma has saved 2 million babies. 
 We only have to save 40 or 50 people. 
 This would be so much easier if you were real. 
 I'm better than nothing. 
 Barely. 
 Are you connected to my silver eyes? 
 Is that why I'm seeing you? 
 Is that your hypothesis? 
 You know I've always hated the Socratic method. 
 Fine. 
 Maybe it's temporary light sensitivity. 
 Or non-episodic cluster headaches. 
 Or maybe you're just going blind. 
 Better than dead, I guess. 
 Or maybe... 
 ...maybe you're survivor zero. 
 The first one cured. 
 But if I'm cured, why am I still hallucinating? 
 I have an even better question. 
 Why are you hallucinating me instead of Alan? 
 (door opening) 
 Sutton is trying to turn me against you. 
 Of course she is. 
 I just wanted to let you know. 
 Sutton can be a dangerous enemy. 
 I understand. 
 No. You don't. 
 She destroys anything that gets in her way. 
 She said something similar about you. 
 What is it you want from me? 
 Your trust. 
 I'm trying to protect you. 
 But there is one thing you can do. 
 Under no circumstances can Sutton be allowed to gain access to Dr. Walker. 
 Why is Walker so important? 
 Is it about the cure? 
 I never cared about the cure. 
 But I thought that's why... 
 Is it not enough that I asked for your help? 
 I think Sutton will kill Walker. 
 I do not wish that outcome. 
 (grinder buzzing) 
 You should get closer to the heater. 
 Are you really gonna sleep? 
 That's what tired people do. 
 Deus caramba. 
 Jeez, you can't even speak Spanish correctly. 
 That's 'cause it's Portuguese. 
 See? Horrible Spanish. 
 Where's your home? 
 Espirito Santo. Just north of Rio. 
 I really am sorry. You know, about the missing kids. 
 As a child, we were warned to stay near the hunting camps. 
 Otherwise, the Qalupalik would take us. 
 Qalu-who? 
 Boogeyman. Child-stealer. 
 But I grew up and discovered my Boogeyman was real. 
 Mine too. 
 A lot of kids go missing in Espirito Santo? 
 Yeah. 
 (She groans.) 
 Fine. 
 I don't like you. 
 But I'm sorry about whatever you went through. 
 Dr. Farragut. 
 Ms. Sutton. 
 Please, call me Constance. 
 So, how is the search for the cure progressing? 
 It isn't, without Dr. Walker. 
 I thought we had an understanding. 
 You take care of the lab work, and I will take care of everything else. 
 I'm afraid you didn't square the circle on that one, Constance. 
 Plans are in motion. My security team will be going down to retrieve Dr. Walker very soon. 
 And I'll be going with them. 
 I'm afraid that's a non-starter, Alan. 
 We can't allow anything to happen to you. 
 Dr. Walker is a member of my team. I need to guarantee her safety. 
 I'm sensing you have some trust issues. 
 If I don't go, no one goes. 
 Suit yourself. But you will have an armed escort at all times. 
 I wouldn't have it any other way. 
 System voice :  Perimeter alert. 
 Perimeter alert. 
 Perimeter alert. (softly): Miksa. What the hell are you doing here? You mean alive? Miksa! You even feel like him. Who the hell are you? He says you think your name is Daniel. Your name is Miksa. You were taken from us as a child. Listen, I don't know who you think I am... I've been searching for you my entire life. My brother. What is this? What are you trying to pull? Don't look at me. She's got another one exactly like you back home. Your brother, your twin! Tulok. Impressive. But I can use Photoshop too. Take him to Isolation. I'll deal with her. System voice :  Attention. Code 197. Level G. One, two, three, four. Four steps to the table. One, two, three steps to the cabinet. Ah! One step to the cart. Gotta remember that. 
 
 (banging against door) Dr. Hatake? Is that you? (door handle jiggling) Peter? (growling) (man yelling) (vector shrieking) (vector shrieking) (door opening) Nice to see you've made yourself at home. Hiroshi, who is Julia Walker? Why haven't you mentioned her? Why would I? You briefed us that poor dead veterinarian, Doreen... Walker seemed unimportant. Dr. Farragut seems to think she's the exact opposite of unimportant. She's his ex-wife. Ah, nepotism. Is that his reasoning? Perhaps. And what is yours? Recruiting. I have files on all CDC scientists. So she is important. I chose not to recruit her, so no, I don't believe so. A difference of opinion then. Good. Human Resources problems I can understand. I'll tell you what, Hiroshi, I will personally arbitrate Dr. Walker's importance or lack thereof when I go down to Level R and pull her out. Where is she? She's in a lab we set up for triage. R-17. (She sighs.) Hiroshi. Let's not forget which side you're on. System voice :  Access granted. Ever use one of these? Recently. Dr. Farragut. You want to come with us? Take the gun. System voice :  Scheduled cleaning, Level B. Do you really think you can trust them? No, but you saw what happened when we went down there alone. All these guns around... Might as well use them to get what we want. Go get Julia, please, so that we can all go home. Balleseros. Constance : Doctor Farragut! Man : Hey, hey, hey! Constance : Doctor Farragut! Please! Stop! Stop it! That man killed Dr. Boyle! The army en... You killed a member of the CDC who's trying to find a cure for this virus? I promise you, I will make this man pay. You have neither the time nor the wherewithal to handle this right now. I do. This is not your concern. No, but if my men handle this, that puts you back in the lab faster, and that is very much my concern. Give me a minute with the prisoner, and get ready for Level R insertion and retrieval. Ma'am. Dismissed. sh1t. What was that for? You murdered 25% of the workflow we need for the cure. How about I kill 25% of you? Come on, Constance. Ms. Sutton. What am I paying you for? Virus. Cure. Wrong. That is what Ilaria pays you for. I, on the other hand, tasked you with finding me proof that Hatake has gone off the rails. The last time you checked in, you said you were on to something. Sorry to disappoint you. I've been a little busy trying not to get killed. So you have nothing... except excuses? And a perforated spleen. You created the Hatake situation. Don't you blame me for your mess. That's why I like you, Serge. You're either very brave or very... very foolish. Apparently, both. A brave fool is still a fool. So, are you gonna take these off, or am I still in a time-out? I need Alan as an ally. Releasing you will be the quickest way to screw that up. You're kidding, right? Do I ever kid? So I stay? So you stay. Plus, I'm not sure you would survive an encounter with that Daniel character. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Oh, now, if I were you, I would think that my... soft kisses... ...are all the vote I needed. Lieutenant Klein! (door opening) Throw him in Isolation. (breathing audibly) System voice :  Access granted. Dr. Walker. Where were you? What happened here? Was it the other scientists? No, a vector. Are you hurt? It was here, right in front of me, ready to attack, and then it just... and then... it just stopped. Dr. Walker, you look... better. Alive. Healthy. Possibly going crazy. All of the above. This is wonderful. Yeah, except for the crazy part. Could do without that. I'll need to draw blood. Run diagnostic tests. I've already done all the tests. There's no sign of the virus. The only thing-Ah! Ah, my eyes hurt! There's something happening to my eyes. Everything's blurry. Sit here. Let me get you some bandages. Close your eyes. Are you okay? System voice :  Level E. My sit-reps indicate these vectors are fast and strong? System voice :  Level F. Like nothing you've ever seen. And the others? Human. Suffering prolonged and fatal cellular breakdown due to the NARVIK-A strain. System voice :  Level E. Or not suffering at all. You said there were healthy people down there as well? There were. Now I don't know. System voice :  Level R.  (door buzzer) Perez, take point. Clear. Lab R-17? This way, I think. You heard the man. Let's go. Roger that. Can you walk? Yes. Why? We need to leave this place. Why? There is a woman coming down here to kill you. What are you talking about? I'll explain everything, but right now, we need to leave. Does Alan know about this? He's coming down with her. Alan would never... He doesn't know what she's capable of. I do. You have to come with me. No. I want to wait for Alan. If you do... you'll die. You have to trust me. Julia... please. Okay. System voice :  Access granted. Alan, wait a moment. Make entry. Single shots, no bursts. Dr. Walker's precious cargo. On my mark. Ready. Breach! (vector shrieking) Man : Look out! (gunshots) (vector shrieking) (vector hissing) Full retreat! Let's go! Go! Fall back! Philip's down! Leave him. (vector roaring) I have to find Julia. She's not in there. She's one of them now. I'm not leaving her down here. How is getting yourself infected or killed gonna help her? I don't know, but I can't leave her behind. We have to get back upstairs. Then we come back down with more security, bigger numbers. Otherwise we're sitting ducks. Duck! I'm going to find Julia. You still don't understand how this works, do you? Get to the elevator. I just saved your life. And I am extremely appreciative, but right now I have to protect my investment. By putting a bullet through it? Go ahead. If it's the difference between shooting you now and shooting you later when you're one of them, then fine, although I will need to put a bullet through young Sarah as well. Loose ends. Let's escort Dr. Farragut back up to Level B, please, Lt. Klein? Yes, ma'am. Why here? No cameras. Father took that. Father? He's dead. Mother too. And what did you call me? Miksa. It was our grandfather's name. And why should I believe you? Any of this? Why would I lie? Dr. Hatake has many enemies. Hatake? He's responsible. He's the one that stole you, along with the others. The others? Thirty-one children over the years. Do you remember any of them? There were always children here. I thought it was normal. What happened to them? I don't know. Maybe you didn't want to know. Where are we? Upstairs. You are safe. Daniel? What's the meaning of this? Don't. Just don't. And you are? His sister. The one you left behind when you stole him from his family. Dr. Walker, these men will escort you back to the lab. Take these. You'll need them. Go. You'll be fine. What about you? I'm not sure. Dr. Walker. Julia! I'm... Get her out of here. The floor is secured for now. We should be safe up here. System voice :  Level B. Elevator locked. I've just sacrificed my own men for you. Now it's your turn. Run along and find me that cure. Well, what about Dr. Walker? Oh, Alan. She's one of those things now, or dead. I don't know which is worse. (gasping in pain) Oh, my God. Jules. Jules. What are you doing here? I thought you were... Look at you. Your symptoms are gone. I'm cured. At least, I, uh, I mean... I think I am. How? I don't know. (Julia sniffles.) Look at me.
