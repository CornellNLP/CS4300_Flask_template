 [GASPS] 
 It's all right. 
 Alan? It's all right. Relax. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [PANTING] 
 What happened? You tell me. 
 I found you here passed out. 
 What do you remember'? Uh, I was, uh... 
 I was, uh... taking a shower, decontamination procedures and, uh... 
 [PETER GROWLING] 
 Uh... Um... 
 I, uh... 
 What? I... 
 Jules. I felt lightheaded. I don't remember-- 
 I don't remember what happened next. 
 I guess I, um... 
 I didn't realize how exhausted I am. 
 Well, we've all been pushing really hard. 
 You need to get a few hours' sleep. 
 I need you a hundred percent. 
 Okay, good idea. 
 I'll walk you back to your quarters. 
 With Peter roaming around out there, it's not safe to go alone. 
 I'll give you a moment. 
 [THUMPING ABOVE] 
 Hello? 
 Anybody in here? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Help. 
 Help me. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [PEOPLE WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] 
 Doreen : Please report to me immediately if you see any skin lesions, flu-like symptoms or black mucus discharge. 
 Should we not be taking antivirals? 
 Like oseltamivir? That's for H1N1 influenza. 
 We've ruled that out as a cause of infection. 
 What is it then? It's all right. 
 Taking the wrong meds can do more harm than no meds at all. 
 We're working round the clock on a treatment, and when we find it, we'll attack the virus aggressively. 
 Now they are scared, I get that, but sometimes, I just wanna yell at them. 
 We're not the enemy here. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Security teams are doing constant sweeps. 
 Still no sign of our three escapees or Peter Farragut. 
 And another attack has been reported on Level G, two more possibly infected. 
 They're being moved to isolation. 
 [SIGHS] 
 We've been in lockdown for 32 hours. People are panicking. 
 If something doesn't change, we risk losing control of the base. 
 Where is Julia Walker? 
 I'm not sure. Do you wanna speak to her? 
 That won't be necessary. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Dr. Farragut, what are you doing? 
 Getting my brother into containment. Why didn't you inform us? 
 Because I presumed the man you had following me would tip you off. 
 I want a full workup, LFT, CBC with differential, coags, viral screen, and all available antigen-antibody assays. 
 My security teams couldn't wrangle him. How did you manage it? 
 He turned himself in. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Hatake : What is Peter's status? Stable for now. 
 I meant the status of his sedation. We don't want another security incident. 
 That's unlikely. 
 As unlikely as cutting off a man's hand to access his RFID chip? 
 Peter gave himself up, no fight, no struggle. 
 Why would he if he were planning to escape? 
 That's what we thought the last time we put him in isolation. 
 He appears to be controllable on morphine. 
 I've hooked him up to a pain pump. He shouldn't be a danger. 
 I'm not willing to take that chance. Neither am I. 
 Is there somewhere more secure we can hold him? 
 This floor was phase one of Arctic Biosystems. 
 As the company grew, so did the facility. 
 Level R contains our early labs and living quarters, along with maintenance for the entire base. 
 The CO2 oxygen scrubbers, the heating systems, equipment storage, though most of the lab work has moved upstairs. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Automated Voice  (over PA): Scheduled maintenance. 
 Now we use this level for sensitive and hazardous research. 
 One of the empty labs should provide the security you're looking for. 
 Daniel : The ventilation system in this room is separate from the rest of the facility. 
 The walls are concrete, three feet thick, and the door is double-plated steel. Nothing is getting in or out. 
 What kind of research were you conducting with nuclear reactors? 
 I spent time at Sandia Labs. 
 The burn patterns on these walls are virtually identical. 
 Controlled fusion, a project we abandoned. 
 When was the last radiation screen down here? 
 Daniel : We test every six months, and the lab has been empty for about five years. 
 Alan : So it's safe? Perfectly. 
 More than qualified to be an isolation unit for Peter. 
 And for everyone else as well. 
 There are empty rooms on this level, plenty of space, and this secure lab allows us to separate vectors from those who are just infected. 
 Vectors? 
 It's what we're calling the infected who are physically attacking others to spread the disease, like Peter. 
 I think we can achieve full containment down here. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying we turn Level R into an isolation floor. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [WATER DRIPPING] 
 [swan-nus] 
 [PANTS] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [CROAKING] 
 [YELLING] 
 [PANTING] 
 Get it together, Jules. 
 You don't get sick. 
 Automated Voice  (over PA):  Attention, code 425, Level R. 
 All right, we have 18 sick in isolation, including Peter. 
 With three on the loose and two presumed infected, that's 23. 
 That we know of. I wanna move them down to Level R. 
 I'll need medical equipment. Turn one of the labs into a triage unit. 
 I'll need food, water, bedding for 40 patients. 
 This will get bigger before we achieve full containment. 
 I think we can accommodate that. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Help me. Help me. 
 Help me. 
 Hatake : Stay where you are. 
 I'm sorry I ran. They made me do it. We can help. 
 They made me. You need to stop. 
 Believe me. They made me- 
 [GUNSHOT] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Bring a gurney, and find Dr. Chaplin. 
 No. There's no time. 
 She's going into shock. 
 Find me a scalpel and something to pack into the wound. 
 [SULEMANI GRUNTS] 
 Stay with me now. You'll be okay. Hurry up! 
 Right, I feel the bullet. 
 Here, pinch off this vein. Pinch off this vein. 
 Yes. More pressure. Right there. I have it, I have it. 
 All right. 
 You're gonna be fine now. She should be stable enough to move. 
 We take her down to the fusion lab. Thanks to your quick thinking. 
 My quick thinking shouldn't have been necessary in the first place. 
 All right. Come on. 
 Come on! 
 She was unarmed and asking for our help. 
 I was only trying to protect Dr. Hatake. 
 She wasn't threatening him, she was scared. 
 The situation was escalating. It didn't escalate until you panicked, and almost murdered an infected patient. 
 I set the rules on this base. 
 There are no countries here, no laws. 
 Dr. Sulemani's life is my responsibility, not Daniel's. 
 As senior scientist on this case, every patients life is my responsibility. 
 You tell your security people that this is the last time lethal force is to be used on one of my patients. 
 I can't guarantee that. You tell them. 
 Or I will pull my team and we can do this again in six months' time as a postmortem. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 What did you do to me, Peter? 
 What did you do? 
 [PETER MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [POUNDING ON GLASS] 
 Alan : We seal off the stairwells, use the elevator for an airlock, and once we control access to the floor, we should have a viable isolation unit. 
 Healthy people come upstairs, sick people go down. It might work. 
 But if people aren't showing symptoms yet, how do we know who's infected? 
 We'll need a test, something that we can administer quickly. 
 A rapid-response test would be the fastest. 
 But first we need to synthesize a pure sample of the virus. 
 Both viruses. What about those vials you found in Peter's lab? 
 Neither Narvik-A nor B show up as a pathogen in any existing database. 
 Narvik-B is the strain that created the vectors in the rat population, right? 
 How long to synthesize a test based on that variant? 
 Eight hours at least for something functional. 
 You have four. Work with Jordan. 
 Tell me more about this infected monkey. 
 I think the virus inside the monkey is the key. 
 I'm sequencing the full genome now. 
 If we can prove the infection passed from monkey to human-- 
 It gets us closer to the original strain. 
 And the best shot we have at a vaccine. All right, get started on it. 
 I'll go with her. Can't be too careful right now. 
 Thanks, but I can take care of myself. Doreen, take him with you. 
 All right, everybody, the com-link window goes live in six hours and 42 minutes. 
 If we have this data to upload to Atlanta, we might just get on top of this thing. 
 Let's get to work. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Alan : --and 20 bags-- Make that 30 bags of saline drip. 
 Daniel : Our base doctor's seen Dr. Sulemani. She's gonna make it. 
 Well, have him keep her on a propofol infusion. 
 I didn't panic with Sulemani. 
 She was infected with a lethal virus and coming at Dr. Hatake. 
 I assessed the options and I pulled the trigger. 
 We shoot everyone who's infected? Is that it? Eliminate the threat? 
 If necessary. And those who might be infected? 
 We kill them too? 
 The only reason you didn't fire that shot is because the gun wasn't in your hands. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Automated Voice  (over PA):  Maintenance team to living quarters, Level B. 
 Another false positive. 
 Me too. I've gone through all the atypical enzymes. 
 You started with atypicals? Their catalyzation rate is too low. 
 I read a study that linked the use of atypical enzymes to viral antibodies. 
 Start wide and narrow it down. It's why I assigned you EC-1 enzymes. 
 EC-1 catalyzes with everything. It tells us nothing. 
 We don't have time to go through a thousand different enzymes. 
 If we're gonna come up with a test, we need to do some-- 
 Sarah. What? 
 What's wrong with your hand? 
 Are you okay? 
 You feeling any symptoms? 
 I've been up for three days straight. I'm probably just exhausted. 
 We're out of Peter's blood serum. I'll get some more. 
 I'll do it. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 If you find the virus did come from the monkeys, will that help you figure out a cure? Curing a virus is a relative term. 
 We need a treatment to help the infected get better, and a vaccine to prevent anyone else from getting infected. 
 That sick monkey is just the first step down a long road. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Where the hell is my monkey? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 What's that smell? Formaldehyde. 
 Whoever did this wanted to kill any living organism left behind. 
 They didn't want me analyzing the samples. 
 It reeks. 
 Reeks all right. Reeks of Hatake. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 What are you gonna do? Walk into his office and demand answers? 
 Why not? Because you know how that's gonna go. 
 He's gonna say it was biosafety protocol, or scheduled maintenance. 
 I knew this full-bird colonel, just like Hatake. Real stickler. 
 You had to find creative ways to get things done. 
 What'd you have in mind? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 What if I could get you another monkey sample? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [SIGHS THEN CHUCKLES] 
 What are you doing here? 
 Three days ago, we were moving on with our lives and now this? 
 Seeing you, it all comes flooding back, how unhappy I was with Alan, how I couldn't even recognize who I was with him anymore. 
 But instead of acknowledging it, I didn't say anything. 
 I just swallowed it, all of it, until it filled me up, and I was drowning in it. 
 And then you. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I thought I could handle this. 
 Doreen : Never seen anything like this. Look at their faces. 
 Balleseros : I know. It's pretty damn scary. 
 No, not scary, scared. 
 These monkeys were running for their lives. 
 Running from what? 
 How'd you find this place, anyway? 
 I was just checking the stability of the icepack around the base. 
 Horseshit. Who the hell are you? 
 I'm just an Army engineer, like I said. 
 You wanna work together? I got no problem with that. 
 But you have got to start telling me the truth. 
 I am. Huh. 
 There are people in the Army, myself included, who are wondering if this outbreak was an accident. 
 You think Hatake did this on purpose? Why would he do that? 
 Why don't you come help me find out? 
 
 
 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [WELDER CRACKLING] 
 I want 24-hour guards on this door until we get full containment. 
 [EARBUD BEEPS] 
 Base one, go ahead. 
 [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO] 
 They found one of the escapees on this level. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 What are you so happy about? Nothing. I just cracked the test. 
 You figured it out? Which enzyme catalyzed? 
 None of them. After you left, I remembered another study. 
 It utilizes the body's natural way of detecting foreign pathogens. 
 White blood cells, yes. Get to the point. 
 It modified the blood cells with genes from a crystal jellyfish  Aequorea Victoria,  to create a rapid-response test. 
 The jellyfish genes produce a fluorescent green protein. 
 You replicated this? I swabbed three security techs for control samples, all clear. I ran the test on known infectees Peter, Dr. Tracey and Dr. DeKlerk. All green, positive for infection. 
 Show me again. Use yourself as a control. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Why does that matter? 
 If you wanna see it in action, I can take a swab from you right now. 
 Okay. Test me. 
 I don't know why we're wasting our time with this. We need to tell Alan. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Come on, Duchamp! I know you're in there! 
 Don't come any closer. Put it down. Put it down. 
 We're going to help you. Just like you took care of Dr. Sulemani. 
 What happened to Dr. Sulemani You want us to die! 
 Was a terrible mistake. 
 We don't wanna hurt you, but you have to come to isolation. 
 I'm not going there. I'm not even infected. 
 [GAGS] 
 Or at least I wasn't until you threw me in with the rest of them. 
 Let me help you. I want the cure! 
 We don't have a cure. Bullshit. 
 The SODRA's in there. 
 You're keeping it from us, and I'm not gonna let you. 
 [STUN BATON CRACKLING AND BRYCE GROANING] 
 Put him in the fusion lab with Sulemani. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 This is Alan Farragut of the CDC. 
 Everybody all right in there? 
 Thank God. They almost got in. 
 What's your name? Philippe Duchamp. 
 What was he saying about you having a cure? 
 This is ridiculous. There is no cure. 
 [DOOR BEEPS AND CLICKS] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Adding growth factor so the cells will build a critical mass for the genome sequencing. 
 And we stick it in the incubator and wait. 
 So do the same thing I've been doing for the last hour. 
 Is that supposed to happen? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [ALARM BLARING] 
 Balleseros : When you said you were growing the virus...? 
 Doreen : It wasn't supposed to grow like that. 
 Like it was alive? 
 Viruses aren't living organisms. 
 They lack any form of energy or carbon metabolism. 
 Why did it Hulk out? That's what we're gonna find out. 
 Maybe Alan will know why it reacted violently to the growth factor. 
 Wait. Don't. Don't what? 
 Don't tell anyone. If Hatake gets wind of this, it'll be the monkey room all over again. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I still don't trust you, but when you're right, you're right. 
 Dr. Bryce said Duchamp was working on a cure, something called SODRA. I can't discuss that. 
 The research is proprietary. No. No more secrets. 
 You promised me transparency. 
 When the satellite comes online, I'll speak with my board of directors. 
 You will tell me everything I need to know, or when that satellite comes online, I'll tell every major news organization on Earth what's happening in this base. You think you're afraid of the U.S. military? 
 Wait till you have to keep your secrets from the New  York Post. 
 SODRA is an antiviral treatment with an astonishing cure rate, nearly 100 percent. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 When you say cure, you mean total viral elimination? 
 With no harm to host cells? Yes. 
 How many viruses have you tested against? 
 How wide a range? All of them. 
 H1N1? Hepatitis? HIV? 
 Hell, smallpox is a virus. 
 There are only two places on Earth that house smallpox, the CDC and Vector Institute in Russia. 
 Actually, there are three. 
 You have been growing lethal viruses for the purpose of developing a cure-all. 
 SODRA works. 
 In all animal lest cases, the viruses were killed. 
 The only problem is the mortality rate. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 How many subjects were killed? Over 75 percent. 
 Which is why SODRA is not an option. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Level R has been sealed. 
 We'll take everyone downstairs, go person to person. 
 Anyone who's infected stays below, everyone else comes back up. 
 A hundred and forty tests ready to go. 
 You two did good work. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Alan : if I call your name, please step over here, take a face shield from Dr. Jordan, and then come stand over here. 
 Doctors Alvarez, Mihalovich, Hassan, Security Tech Terry, Dr. Sun-Lee, and Security Tech Gruning. 
 Those of you whose names I have called, you'll follow me. 
 The rest of you will stay with Dr. Jordan and Dr. Walker. 
 Wait. 
 Why are they getting to go back upstairs? 
 Because they tested negative for the virus. 
 [GROUP MURMURING] 
 Please find any empty cot, make yourselves at home. 
 Dr. Walker and Dr. Jordan will be coming around to collect your medical information. 
 Go ahead. 
 That's the last group. 
 Daniel : How many? 
 Balleseros : Forty-three infected. That's almost a third of the base. 
 I wanna bring Doctors Bryce and Sulemani down here. 
 Shouldn't they stay locked up in the lab? They tried to escape once. 
 This floor is secure. There's no way out. 
 Excuse me. 
 Isolating this level was a good idea. 
 People are settling in. Yeah, but they're scared. 
 I think a lot of them believed they weren't sick. 
 Part of them knew. They just didn't wanna believe it. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 I took Peter's vitals again. He's all over the place. 
 I'm sending his lab work to the CDC  as  soon as the satellite window opens. 
 Get some more heads in the game, on finding a safe treatment and a vaccine. 
 That may be too late for him. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Daniel : Open the door. Let's get these people into the isolation barracks. 
 [GROWLING]

 [STUN BATON CRACKLING AND SULEMANI SCREAMS]

 [YELLS]

 [CHATTERING] 
 Almost done with the samples? I was just about to bring them upstairs. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 What's wrong? Nothing, I'm fine. I just slipped. 
 What? Are you infected, Sarah? 
 You were in the stockroom with Peter. Did he attack you? 
 No. I told you. He ran off. That's right, you told us. 
 You think I would lie about that? 
 Your symptoms. You tried to hide your hand tremor this morning. 
 You wouldn't use yourself as a control sample for the rapid-response test. You want me to take the test? 
 Fine. I'm not judging. I can understand why-- 
 I would never risk spreading an infectious disease. 
 That's completely unethical. What kind of doctor do you think I am? 
 [♪♪♪] 
 It's clear. 
 Happy? I'm sorry. I just-- I thought that-- 
 Daniel : Where's Alan? Checking the triage room. Why? 
 We have a problem. 
 Dr. Sulemani broke out of the fusion lab. 
 She killed Dr. Bryce. What? 
 Dr. Sulemani is on this level? She's killing people! 
 Man 1 : Get me out of here! 
 Man 2 : Killing people? 
 [PEOPLE CLAMORING] 
 Man 3 : Out of the way! 
 Remain calm. 
 Stop! 
 Man 1 : Let me out of here! 
 Man 2 : Just stay calm. 
 Man 3 : Calm down. 
 [ALL CLAMORING] 
 Everyone remain calm. 
 Sarah! Alan! 
 What's going on? Where's Julia? 
 Man 3 : Get back!

 We need to get in the elevator. I can't. 
 We'll regroup, get medical supplies. I have to stay here. 
 It's too dangerous. We have to go. Alan, I can't. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 What happened? 
 Where is Dr. Walker? 
 She's staying down there. 
 How could you risk leaving her? Dr. Farragut. Alan! 
 She's infected. She has the virus. 
 We need to seal off Level R. It's the only way to stop the contagion. 
 Leave them down there? With no food or water? 
 There's a week's worth of supplies. He's right. 
 We've... 
 I have lost control of this situation. 
 We need to seal it off. 
 How can you say that with Dr. Walker still down there? 
 It's only until help arrives. 
 When the satellite com link goes operative again, I'm calling in the Army for backup. 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪] 
 Two hundred and seventy-four. 
 Three nurses in Kikwit of Ebola, family of six in Sudan, Lassa fever, 10 students in a Heidelberg dorm, Legionnaires' Disease-- 
 We've all had people die on our watch, Alan. 
 It's part of the job. We save who we can. 
 I could live with 274 because it was the disease that killed them, not me, until now. 
 I not only killed someone with my own hands today, but it's very likely... 
 Julia is very likely-- 
 Way I hear it, you didn't have much of a choice. 
 What we're dealing with here, none of us has ever seen. 
 You're still the best CDC has. I've seen you pull off miracles. 
 You'll figure out a way to save them both. 
 What happened with the monkey? 
 Uh, it's inconclusive for now. 
 That's too bad. I'm still doing tests.
