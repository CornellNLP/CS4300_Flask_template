 Previously on Helix... 
 He's crashing! 
 That's his ex-wife? He never talks about her or his brother. 
 That's probably because he caught her and his brother in bed together. 
 I did this. 
 I've been here before. 
 You tested negative. 
 Are you really sure? 
 I can't keep you here. You're sick. 
 I'm not the only one. 
 How long have you known about your tumor? 
 (Three gunshots) 
 The people who designed this virus want to change us, from the inside out. 
 Ah! 
 (Wind blowing) 
 (Footsteps in the snow) 
 (Device chimes.) 
 Who the hell is Dr. Hvit? 
 (Screeching) 
 (Loud screeching) 
 Dr. Farragut, you wanted to see me? 
 Yeah, I want to show you something. 
 Is it Peter? 
 No. His status is unchanged. 
 Still no brain activity. 
 Have a look at this. 
 I used your protocols and a modified compound I've been experimenting with. 
 I substituted multiple residues at these two binding sites, Added a tetrahydrofuran carbamate here, a triazine ring here, all to reduce stearic interaction. 
 And that's taking the virus longer to break the SODRAs down. 
 But it still does in the end. I've taken this as far as I can in culture. I need to see how it reacts in living tissue. 
 I can start animal studies to test efficacy and safety right away. 
 We could have results in 24 hours. 
 I'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist, Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this. I think she could be a big help. 
 Alan, this is progress. 
 It has to work in the rats first. 
 And if it does? - If it does, Hatake won't have any more excuses. 
 We'll reopen level R, start testing Julia and the rest of the infected patients. 
 Dr. Farragut. I asked you to check in on the hour. 
 Uninterrupted research is how we get results. 
 If Hatake has a problem with that, he can talk to me himself. 
 For whatever that's worth. 
 He's left me in charge while he takes care... 
 While he conducts "base business." right. 
 (Van Eigem groaning in pain) 
 (Van Eigem groaning loudly) 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 Shh. Someone might hear you. 
 It hurts. 
 I know, but you have to stay quiet. 
 If they find you, they'll take you back to level R. 
 I have to get back to my lab work. 
 I'll try and get back as soon as I can with more morphine. 
 (Groaning in pain) 
 Warm, gooey chocolate brownies. 
 A study at the University of Wisconsin showed that fantasizing about delicious food can help minimize pain. 
 Brownies are my go-to. 
 Cupcakes. 
 That's good. 
 What kind? The more specific, the better. 
 Uh... 
 Red velvet, cream cheese icing. 
 And none of that flaky cake. 
 I like it dense. 
 Did it help? 
 A little... 
 But now I'm hungry. (She laughs.) 
 (Van Eigem groans.) 
 The worst part is the waiting. 
 Death should come out of nowhere. 
 You shouldn't have to stare it in the face. 
 How do you do it, knowing you're just waiting to die? 
 We're all waiting to die. 
 I just have a little less time. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 It's comfy. 
 Get out of his chair. 
 Sure. Where's Dr. Hvit? 
 Who? 
 Dr. Hvit. 
 I need to speak to him or her right away. 
 There's no one on this base by the name of Dr. Hvit. 
 Now get out of his chair. 
 He's got you well trained. 
 Excuse me? 
 How much is he paying you to inspire such loyalty? 
 I don't work for him. 
 That's right. 
 He adopted you. You're like a son to him. 
 I am his son. 
 You know, in the favelas in Rio, the gangs, they call themselves a familia. 
 Family. And they have a saying: "Blood in, blood out." 
 They'd find these little boys, nine, 10 years old, and they'd make them murder people to bond them to the gang. 
 Blood in. 
 And these boys, they'd go so deep, they'd have no idea that they were grunts, that they were expendable. 
 And if they disobeyed, or tried to leave the gang... 
 Blood out. 
 Hatake's down on level R, doing god knows what. 
 You think he left you in charge because he trusts you, or because he's trying to distract you? 
 You need to get out of this office. 
 Now. 
 (Yelling in pain) 
 (Pounding on door) 
 Please. We have food. 
 There's plenty here. We can all share. 
 (Coughing) 
 Man : Are you sick? 
 Get the hell away from here! 
 This is a waste of time. 
 We should get out of the hallway. 
 We have to organize the people down here. 
 It's a better chance of survival. 
 Can we talk about the reason you don't want to go back? 
 What's that? 
 The initials on the wall. Your initials. 
 They weren't my initials. I've never been here before. 
 So how do you explain that it was your handwriting? 
 Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection. 
 Nice try, but I saw them too. 
 Is it possible you were here when you were younger? 
 Yeah, I must have forgotten all those family vacations to the Arctic Circle. 
 (She sighs.) I grew up in Montana. 
 The most exotic place I ever went as a kid was Bozeman. 
 Jules. 
 What did you just call me? 
 If you don't like it, I won't call you that. 
 No, it's just, uh... 
 Alan and my mother were the only ones who ever called me that. 
 (Metallic clanking) 
 (Hatake groaning) 
 Help... Please. 
 (Beep) (Door opening) 
 Doreen! 
 Jesus. Hold on. 
 What happened? Was... Was she attacked by a vector? 
 It was the rats. 
 The rats? How did they get out? 
 The cages were turned over on her. 
 Maybe she had some kind of heart attack, Grabbed the rack, and it went down when she did. 
 Or someone pushed it. 
 You think someone did this on purpose? 
 We have annual physicals for field duty. 
 If Doreen had any hint of cardiac distress, she'd never have been permitted to join this investigation. 
 Altitude changes effect individuals differently. 
 And The CO2 scrubbers were turned off for four hours yesterday. 
 Seems like she was in pretty good health to me. 
 Do you know how many murders have occurred at this base, Dr. Farragut? 
 Zero. 
 Accidents, however, happen all the time... 
 This wasn't a goddamn accident! 
 Until the evidence suggests otherwise... 
 Evidence? 
 We're in the ass-end of nowhere, cut off from the world. 
 My best doctor is trapped and dying somewhere below us, and my closest friend from the CDC has very likely just been murdered. 
 This place is a... It's a time bomb waiting to go off, And we're pretending this... These goddamn things are gonna save us! 
 Right now, I'm thinking the virus is not our biggest problem. 
 I'll review the surveillance footage immediately. - No. 
 Not alone you won't. Sarah, find Dr. Duchamp. 
 Tell him to start the animal trials with the SODRA immediately. 
 You find me if there are complications. 
 I said we would bring food and water if they turned the oxygen scrubbers back on, but they attacked me. 
 The bleeding is slowing, but you're gonna need stitches. 
 We need to get you to that lab we set up for triage. 
 That's on the other side of the facility. We can't drag him all the way over there. 
 Why not? 
 What was that? 
 Dr. Hatake, this is Jaye. Jaye, Hatake. 
 Jaye? - Don't pretend like you don't know who I am. 
 And I won't pretend I'm gonna help you after you locked us down here to fend for ourselves. 
 You did seal us up down here. 
 I had no choice. 
 We could not allow the infection to spread. 
 We need to get you to that lab, close up this wound. 
 It's too dangerous. We'd never make it. 
 Is there any other way across this level? 
 An access tunnel. 
 It goes all the way to the other side of the base. 
 But I would not ask you to... risk your life for mine. 
 You don't have to ask. 
 You need my help, I'm gonna help you. 
 Let's narrow the window of incident. 
 When was the last time you saw Dr. Boyle? 
 About 9 am yesterday morning. 
 In 10 hours, you didn't check in with her? 
 I was running SODRA trials on my brother. 
 And she was capable, she didn't need to check in. 
 Right. "uninterrupted research." 
 What happened there? 
 The file's been corrupted. 
 I'll check the backup. 
 Uh-huh. 
 That's impossible. The backups have been deleted too. 
 The only ones with access are me and... 
 Hatake, who's conveniently disappeared. 
 Neither of us have anything to do with this. 
 I will find out what happened to Dr. Boyle. 
 I'll find out myself through an autopsy. 
 Dr. Duchamp? 
 I'm Major Balleseros. 
 Is this another check-in? 
 I'm showing no signs of infection. 
 No. 
 I'm looking for a Dr. Hvit. 
 That's a name I haven't heard in a while. 
 I was going through the research files, and I saw that you two did a paper together. 
 That was many years ago. 
 So he's no longer on the base? 
 Oh, no, he is. 
 It's just, no one ever sees him any more. 
 I hear he developed a rare immune deficiency. 
 He can no longer interact with people. 
 He's become somewhat of an urban legend. 
 I heard rumors he's in the white room. 
 Where can I find that? 
 We are all in the white room. 
 Excuse me. I need to speak with the Major. 
 Did you kill the CDC vet? Hm. 
 You'd think I'd remember that. Ugh! 
 Did you do it? 
 What did the surveillance video show? 
 Did Hatake know? 
 Ask him. He tells you everything, right? 
 Dr. Farragut is running an autopsy as we speak. 
 You better hope you covered your tracks. 
 System voice : [i]Code 852, Level D, Hematology. Attention: Code 852, Level D, Hematology. Attention: Code 852, Level D, Hematology. Dr. Van Eigem? sh1t. Dr. Van Eigem, what are you doing? I'm dancing for Tony. Tony isn't here. Of course he is. (Groaning in pain) What's wrong? (Shrieking) (Shrieking) What happened? I couldn't stop myself. I'm gonna turn into one of those things, aren't I? We need to get you back to the room. Come on. Julia : How long is it? Forty meters. I vote we go around. Who knows what's waiting for us in there? We don't have time. All right, let's go. (Grunting with effort) (Glass crunching) What are we stepping on? Julia : Looks like glass. Someone busted the lights out. Probably trying to hide. Or... Setting a trap. 
 
 Found anything? She died of an embolism. A scan revealed bruising in the left hemisphere of her brain, consistent with an air bubble. So it was natural causes. Why would anyone have erased the security footage? Did you see Doreen yesterday? Just in passing. Did she say anything? About her research? Any breakthrough she might've had? No, she didn't. I didn't know Doreen too well, but she seemed like a good person to have on your team. I knew her 15 years. She didn't deserve this. Did she have any family? A son from her third marriage. Hand me that bottle of alcohol. What is that? Puncture mark. From a needle. I don't want to become one of those things. I know. Don't let me. You know what I'm asking. You're sick. It's the drugs talking. I was on my way to the drug stockroom Before... I saw tony. I can't do it myself. Please. Please. (Breathing shakily) (Pounding on door) (Distant voice):  Sarah? Sarah, it's Alan. Uh... Oh... Man : You all right in there? One minute. Hey. Sorry, I was just getting changed. What's going on? Doreen was murdered. The autopsy proves it. How? Somebody used a syringe to make it look like she had an embolism. They knew what they were doing. We need to be careful. Are you ok? Yeah. I'm... I, uh... (Breathing heavily) I... I just don't know what's going on here. I mean... Walker's sick, Doreen's dead, You're telling me that somebody murdered her. I... Are we even gonna make it out of this place alive? Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's ok. It's ok. I won't let anything happen to you. All right? Sarah, I... I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have done that. Are you high? What? I can barely see your pupils. What are you on? I had a migraine, so I took something. What? Gabapentin. You're lying, unless you took the whole bottle. Alan, wait. I... I can expl... No, there's no excuse for this, ever! People's lives are at stake. They're depending on us! You're of no use to me like this! But I... No, you go sleep this off. We'll deal with it later. I'm sorry... Can we take a moment? No, not really. (Hatake groaning) Let me take a look at your wound. Oh. We need to tie something around you for more pressure. Here, use this. And hurry up. I'm gonna need you to lean forward for me. (Noise nearby) What was that? Oh, my god. Rats! Where are they coming from? The more important question is what are they running from? (Jaye gasps.) (Vector shrieking) Run! (Julia and Jaye screaming) The door! Get to the door! Where's Jaye? She was right behind me. I didn't see her. We have to go back! It's too late. (Vector shrieking and pounding on door) What exactly are we looking for? Anything salvageable of Doreen's research. Any clue as to what she might have discovered before she... (Sigh) You think there's some kind of cover-up? Why else would anyone kill her? The transgenics lab. What about it? That lab where they found the monkey. It was totally cleaned out before she had a chance to gather any samples. She didn't tell you? No, she didn't. Sanitized from top to bottom. Figured Hatake must have ordered it. If it was cleaned out, where'd she get the monkey sample she was analyzing? Maybe some of the scientists from here were helping her. Come to think of it, she did mention a name. Dr... Hvit? She never mentioned him to me. That's strange. She said she spoke to him. Said he seemed to have all the answers. Well, I will find this Dr. Hvit and... See if he can shed any light on the situation. I don't know a Dr. Hvit. Doreen talked to him. She... Talked to him? Doreen told you that? No, Major Balleseros did. Major Balleseros also told me how they found the transgenics lab cleaned out. But I guess you know nothing about that either. That was a routine sanitization procedure. Bullshit, that was a cover-up. Why would we want to cover up a virus that we need you to cure? You're so focused on seeing us as the bad guys, you don't see what's right in front of you. How well do you know Major Balleseros? I met him five days ago. Same day you met me. And you trust him? Why? Because he's wearing a uniform? Julia : How did you get those scars on your back? Hatake : There was a fire, years ago, at my home in Kyoto. The entire house was in flames when I arrived. My daughter... was still inside. I tried to save her. What was she like? Your daughter. She was smart. Curious about the world. You... You remind me of her. I haven't heard anything outside for a while. We should try and get to the triage lab. What made you change your mind? I know what it's like to be in pain. The kind of pain that you... You would do anything to make it stop. And I've never considered ending it, but... Don't we all wish that we could control when we go and how we go? Are you sure? Are you really sure? Yes. (Sarah sniffles.) (Van Eigem crying) Thank you. Got something. This is Semtex. Plastic explosive. Balleseros sabotaged the satellite. Because he didn't need it to call out. He's been sending messages to someone since we got here. Doreen's research is on here too. He killed her. Here's the last transmission: "Found Dr. Hvit in the white room. Evac 1500..." (Door opening and closing) What is the damn white room? Attention : Code 517, Level E, Neurology lab. Duchamp. Where is the white room? We are all in the white room. It's an inside joke among the base scientists. We're in the Arctic. it's all the white room. They're outside. I see you got my message. Thanks. I would have never found Hvit without you. Dr. Hatake, stay with me now. We're almost there. Please... Call me Hiroshi. (Panting) Come on. (Vector growling) (Shrieking) Took you guys long enough. Nobody goes outside in a whiteout. You won't even be able to see more than two feet in any direction. There are guide ropes to follow, right? It's not that simple. You've never experienced anything like this. Minus 60, and the wind chill doubles that. Fine, if you're doing this, you stay on the guidelines around the building until you get to the line going out. Do not unclip until you get there, or else you'll just... Disappear. I managed to get Tracey off of me, and then I ran. It was too dark for her to see me, I guess. I ducked into the first lab I could find, and then I came here. I thought for sure you were dead. That makes two of us. Jaye, I... Don't beat yourself up for closing that door. You thought I was right behind you. Looks like we make a pretty good team. We do, don't we? (Hatake groaning) Good. He's waking up. Maybe he can tell us more lies about his daughter. How did you... You weren't there. Hatake : You remind me of her. I wasn't where? You weren't there when Hatake told that story. They weren't my initials. I've never been here before. So how do you explain that it was your handwriting? Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection. No. That's not possible. I watched you do things. Tie something around you for more pressure. Here. Use this. Hurry up. It was you, Jules. It was all you. All those times you saved me. (Julia screams.) (Echoing): You saved yourself. Hey! Coming through! Switch clamps! You killed her, you b*st*rd! You have no idea what's going on here! Doreen was collateral damage... ugh! Ugh! Nice knowing you, Doc. Did Balleseros come back through here? I haven't seen him. He attacked me on the ice. We need to get a security team together and go after him. You don't need to do anything. You should have never been on that ice in the first place. He killed... Doreen. Well, it looks like he almost killed you too. Daniel : I've got a reply for that message! Ahhh! Ah! Ahhh! (He gasps in pain.) Ahh... Hold still. System voice :  Cleanup requested. Pantry, level C. Cleanup requested Pantry, level C. You know why I picked you for my team, Sarah? Because I was the best candidate. Because you were driven. I remember the first day you walked into my office, and... I thought to myself, "That girl, even when she sleeps, she tries to do it better than anyone else." (Chuckle) Nothing distracts us from the work. But that's the problem with laser focus, with our particular way of looking at the world. We only see the thing in front of us, the thing... under the microscope, and we miss what's happening all around. That's why my marriage fell apart. That's why my brother... was up here in this... place. I can't keep making the same mistakes. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you before, but... I'm listening now. I get these migraines. I've had them since college, and when they come on, I... I can't think, I can't... work, I can't do anything. I took some morphine from the drug stockroom. I thought if I just had a little bit to even me out, I'd be able to go back to work. I'm sorry. I've never done anything like this, I swear. It's okay. We've all lost ourselves... A little bit here. (Respirator breathing) My team... has fallen apart. Again. I lost you and Jules last time. Now I've lost Doreen. I don't know what to do. You were always good at that part. Even with Mom, on her worst days, you had hope. I need a little of your hope... Right now, Peter. (Device beeping)
