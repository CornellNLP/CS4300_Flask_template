 [COW GIRL] Hey! 
 I’m gonna go into the city. 
 One of the cows on my uncle’s farm is giving birth and I wanna be there. 
 I’m going all by myself! 
 After that,  I even get to go shopping! 
 I can’t wait to see what they have at all the stores! 
 My mom even gave me money to buy something! 
 I wonder what all I should get. 
 Is there anything you want me to look for? 
 I’d love to buy you a gift--  
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] No. 
 Oh, are you sure? 
 There’s gotta be--  I just told you I don’t want anything. 
 You don’t have to be mean about it. 
 I just wanted to do something special. 
 Since you’ve never been to the city before. 
 ‘Cause that’s what friends do. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Shut up. 
 Just go to the city or whatever it is you’re doing. 
 Why are you so angry? 
 -I’m not angry. 
 -Yes, you are! 
 -Calm down. 
 -[GOBLIN SLAYER] Sis. 
 The two of you shouldn’t be fighting. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER ] We weren’t. 
 We were only talking. 
 -Right? 
 -Sure. 
 That’s right. 
 [OLDER SIS] You’re sure you’re okay? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah, it’s nothing. 
 [OLDER SIS] All right then. 
 If you say so. 
 [COW GIRL MOM] Please take good care of her for me. 
 [COW GIRL UNCLE] I will. 
 How long are you going to pout for? 
 I thought you were looking forward to going into the city. 
 [COW GIRL] Yeah, but... 
 I wanted to go with him. 
 Or, if he couldn’t come, I wanted to buy him something. 
 But then he got really angry. 
 And for no reason, either. 
 [COW GIRL UNCLE] I’m sure the boy wanted to come as well. 
 Think of how he must feel. 
 Did you two make up? 
 If not, you should when you get back. 
 [COW GIRL] I wanted us to not be fighting. 
 I wanted to apologize. 
 But, sometimes it can be hard to say you’re sorry. 
 [COW GIRL] Even now. 
 It’s not easy. 
 [yawns]  Hey, there! 
 Morning! 
 I see you’re up early again. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah. 
 [COW GIRL] The weather’s so nice today. 
 The sun feels great on my skin. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah. 
 Do you know if my uncle is awake already? 
 -I don’t know. 
 -Oh, well. 
 If he isn’t around by now, then I’m sure he will be pretty soon. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] S’pose so. 
 You must be hungry. 
 I’ll go start on breakfast. 
 We can eat together. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Sounds good. 
 [COW GIRL] It’s the same thing every day. 
 Goblins usually move around at night  and return to their nests in the morning. 
 So, at dawn, he checks our land to see  if he can find any footprints. 
 Goblins always scout the area they plan to attack,  so any disturbance is a warning of trouble. 
 If he sees any sort of tracks,  then we’ll know to be extra careful for a while. 
 He always checks the fence, too. 
 Just to see if there are any parts that have come loose  or been damaged since the day before. 
 ‘Cause, of course, that’s a bad sign. 
 If anything is broken, he makes the repairs himself. 
 He keeps our farm and everyone in it safe. 
 Our valiant guardian. 
 It’s been this way for five years,  since he first came to stay with us. 
 His daily routine. 
 And, here you go! 
 [COW GIRL UNCLE] Smells good, as usual. 
 -Thank you. 
 -Eat it while it’s still hot! 
 Huh? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER slurps]  Taste good? 
 I hope you like it. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah. 
 -[slurping] -[GOBLIN SLAYER] Here. 
 Rent money. 
 It’s heavy this month. 
 Being an adventurer must be pretty lucrative. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Sometimes. 
 I’ve had a lot of work lately. 
 [COW GIRL UNCLE] Apparently. 
 Right, so, will you be going out again today? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Yes. 
 I’m visiting the guild. 
 They’ve got plenty of work. 
 Not surprised. 
 Well, don’t push yourself too hard. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] I won’t. 
 Hey! 
 I need to make a few deliveries. 
 I should go with you! 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] If you’d like. 
 Well, in that case,  I’ll go get the wagon ready for you. 
 [COW GIRL] Don’t worry, Uncle. 
 We’ll be fine. 
 I know how overprotective you can be. 
 I’ve got this. 
 I’m a lot stronger than I look, you know. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Do you need help? 
 I’m fine. 
 It’s not that hard. 
 -[GOBLIN SLAYER] Okay. 
 -[COW GIRL] Thank you, though. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] It’s nothing. 
 So, how have things been lately? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Too many goblins. 
 Really? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] An unusual amount. 
 -You must be busy. 
 -[GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah. 
 You have been going out more, much more. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Yeah. 
 Having lots of work is a good thing. 
 -You make more coin. 
 -[GOBLIN SLAYER] No. 
 It’s bad. 
 What do you mean? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] It’s better when there are no goblins. 
 [COW GIRL] Right. 
 Of course. 
 [MAYOR] Please, you gotta help me. 
 Those goblin critters came to my village. 
 If somethin’ don’t happen, they’ll eat my cows  an’ burn my fields to ashes! 
 So you need an exterminator. 
 No problem. 
 I’ll just need your completed form and payment. 
 Yes. 
 Of course, ma’am. 
 Here you are. 
 Seems like everything is in order. 
 I’ll just have to count out your payment to confirm the quest. 
 Two. 
 Four. 
 Eight. 
 Ten. 
 Twelve. 
 Great. 
 Looks like it’s all here. 
 So rest assured an adventurer will come out to your farm  to take care of the problem soon. 
 Is it really true those little monsters treat women  like their playthings, and then eat ‘em up afterwards? 
 Well, yes, there have been cases reported of that happening. 
 [GUILD GIRL sighs heavily]  Another goblin quest? 
 That makes three already. 
 What’s the pay? 
 Welp. 
 Hope they don’t want someone with experience. 
 ‘Cause that’s pretty pathetic. 
 [GUILD GIRL] No, he'll still take it. 
 Money’s not an issue to him. 
 Thanks for the prompt delivery. 
 [COW GIRL] No problem! 
 It was my pleasure. 
 I need to get a signature over at the reception desk. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] All right. 
 Get this. 
 There was this troll, right, a huge sucker. 
 But I was able to dodge his attacks. 
 Got ‘em with my spear before he knew what hit him. 
 [GUILD GIRL] Oh, wow. 
 Nicely done, sir. 
 I’m well-aware that trolls are powerful foes  and that I should be impressed by this. 
 I took down a troll with nothing but my bravery and a spear. 
 I’m not bragging, it’s just true. 
 Uh-huh. 
 If you’re feeling tired, I’d recommend this. 
 Our new stamina potions are best-sellers here. 
 I’ll take whatever you’re selling. 
 [gasps]  Ah! 
 The Goblin Slayer? 
 [MALE ADVENTURER] That’s him? 
 [ELF] He’s the weirdo who only takes goblin-related missions. 
 That big idiot gives silver-ranks like us a bad name. 
 If all he hunts is goblins,  I doubt he could handle anything bigger. 
 I’m surprised they even ranked him up. 
 Just ignore that guy. 
 Our paths’ll never cross. 
 I know! 
 What a slob. 
 I’ve never seen such filthy armor before. 
 [ROOKIE MAGE] Even our equipment  is better than what he’s carrying. 
 [ROOKIE CLERIC WARRIOR] Don’t be so judgmental. 
 He must still be a rookie, just like us. 
 I’d feel bad if he heard you. 
 [thud]  Good morning, everyone. 
 Who’s ready to see all the available quests today? 
 [ALL] Yes, finally! 
 Come on! 
 I want to slay a dragon. 
 Heroic feats like that are the fastest way to gain experience. 
 There’s no way. 
 You don’t got the equipment. 
 How ‘bout you just stick to taking out bandits. 
 That usually pays well, too. 
 Man, look at these awful porcelain-ranked quests. 
 They hardly pay anything. 
 And I don’t wanna have to clean ditches. 
 You can’t be too picky when you’re just starting out. 
 Oh, hey. 
 What about that one there. 
 Goblins are easy, right? 
 Sounds like a good rookie quest for us. 
 [APPRENTICE CLERIC] No way. 
 You heard what the Guild Girl told us. 
 We should start with the sewers and work our way up. 
 Move, kids, let the real adventurers through. 
 You idiot. 
 Don’t push. 
 The big quest is ours, little spearman. 
 Look somewhere else. 
 That’s no way to talk to the greatest warrior in the room. 
 [chuckles]   
 [GUILD GIRL] Please, settle down, everyone. 
 There’s no reason to fight amongst yourselves. 
 [COW GIRL] He’s not even gonna go look at the quests? 
 He did say there’s no reason to rush,  since none of the other adventurers  like killing goblins. 
 Sir. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Hello. 
 About what I was saying to you a few days ago. 
 I still don’t think it’s a very good idea  to use flammable liquids, especially if it’s in a cave. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Your thinking is flawed. 
 What would you prefer: that we just let the goblins live? 
 [PRIESTESS] Well, no, of course not,  but think of the consequences. 
 What if you caused an avalanche or a cave in? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] The goblins are a bigger problem. 
 [PRIESTESS] I know they are, but every cause has an effect,  and we’ve got to consider the risks. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] I see. 
 Please at least try to find another way. 
 [COW GIRL] He said he’d formed a party  with someone about a month ago,  but I didn’t think it’d be with a girl. 
 And, also,  when we’re covering up our scents,  can we use something besides blood? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] No. 
 What times of day  do we usually attack goblins? 
 Um, early morning, or early evening. 
 [giggles]  
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Tell me why. 
 Because early evening for goblins is early morning for us. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Correct. 
 So, their afternoons are the middle of our nights. 
 That’s when they’re most guarded. 
 Next, what are the steps to approaching them? 
 [PRIESTESS] Uh, well, if possible,  we’ll smoke them out with fire. 
 That’ll throw off their defenses. 
 Plus, it’s dangerous inside their nests. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] That’s right. 
 The only reasons we would ever enter a nest are:  if there’s no other way,  or we’re certain we can kill them all. 
 Well done. 
 Oh, good morning Goblin Slayer, it’s so nice to see you. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Are there any quests that involve goblins? 
 [GUILD GIRL] Ah, yes, of course. 
 We have three goblin quests. 
 There’s a swarm in the western river village. 
 And a small nest in the southern forest. 
 And then, an old mountain fort that’s been claimed by goblins. 
 That one will be really tough. 
 It’s a castle that’s been fortified. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] They’ve settled there? 
 Yes. 
 And there’s been a few casualties. 
 The younger sister of the person  who requested help was kidnapped. 
 No one’s heard from the adventurer  who went into the castle to find her. 
 He’s completely disappeared. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] It’s too late for them. 
 But I can kill the goblins. 
 That will prevent further deaths at their hands. 
 [GUILD GIRL] We’ll be counting on your success, then. 
 I wish you the best of luck. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] One last question. 
 Did anyone else take goblin-slaying quests? 
 [GUILD GIRL] Yes, a party of rookies went off on one. 
 They’re headed to the river village. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] What was their party like? 
 
 
 
 Um... 
 One warrior, a wizard, and a priest. 
 Each porcelain-ranked. 
 Like I said, they were all pretty new. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Not a bad balance. 
 [PRIESTESS] If it’s the three I heard earlier,  they’re in way over their heads. 
 Even my party had four members. 
 Yes, I did try to explain that to them. 
 They’re going to die. 
 We have to stop them from going there. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Do as you please. 
 I’m going to destroy the mountain castle. 
 You’re going to abandon them? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] If you believe you can save that group,  feel free to try. 
 [PRIESTESS] But that would mean you’d have to face  this horde of goblins on your own. 
 That’s far too dangerous! 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] That wouldn’t be anything new. 
 I’m just saying this seems way too risky. 
 Honestly. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Are you coming? 
 Of course! 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] I’m going out. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. 
 Please be careful. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Get home safely. 
 [door opens]  
 [COW GIRL] I waited for him,  but he didn’t come back that night. 
 Or the next one. 
 All I could do was wonder what he was doing,  and if he would return. 
 You’re going to have a hard time tomorrow  if you stay up too late. 
 I know. 
 Just a little while longer. 
 Then I’ll head to bed. 
 [wind blowing] 
 [evil laughter]  
 [growling] 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Think about how it would feel. 
 If your home was suddenly attacked by monsters,  without any warning. 
 Picture it. 
 They show up out of nowhere, and before you know it,  they’re obliterating your village. 
 They burn and destroy whatever they want. 
 They kill your friends. 
 And your family. 
 Then they plunder what’s left. 
 [blood splatters]  Now, imagine if your older sister was attacked. 
 She’d be tortured, forced to endure unspeakable things,  and then finally, killed. 
 Let’s say you witnessed all of this firsthand. 
 Holding your breath in a hiding spot. 
 Waiting to die. 
 [sobbing]  
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] There’s no way you’d forgive them. 
 You would take up weapons  and devote your entire life to getting revenge. 
 You’d hunt the monsters down one by one. 
 You’d kill obsessively, your hands always smelling of blood. 
 [ROOKIE MAGE] Look, we made it. 
 [ROOKIE SWORDSMAN] Finally. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Some days, you’d be successful,  and on others, you would fail. 
 You’d try to figure out the best way  to kill them the next time. 
 This would be the only thing that occupied your mind. 
 You’d test every idea you came up with, no matter how absurd. 
 And against your better nature. 
 You’d start to enjoy it. 
 [growling]  A naive person might suggest you let the children live. 
 But she’s not thinking about  how they’ll grow up to attack the villages,  stealing women and livestock to survive. 
 You’ll watch young, aspiring adventurers. 
 Those with new porcelain ranks, who will think,  “I chased away a goblin that came to my village once. 
 They’re weak. easy to deal with.”  
 These rookies won’t realize  that the goblin they proudly chased away  was likely an injured Wanderer whose horde has been destroyed. 
 Still, this gives the young adventurer false confidence. 
 Meanwhile, goblins that survive an attack gain experience. 
 They become Wanderers and grow stronger. 
 Eventually, the Wanderers become bodyguards,  or leaders of new nests. 
 In a way,  I am, in turn, a monster to them. 
 I know you’re worried, but you need to remember,  that the only reason I allow him to stay here  is because he pays us so well. 
 He may have been your childhood friend back then,  but he’s not that boy anymore. 
 -[metal clinks] -Huh? 
 [COW GIRL UNCLE] Look, the truth is... 
 He’s completely lost it. 
 You know that, but you choose to ignore it. 
 I understand. 
 But I’m still going to wait. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] That makes five. 
 [snarling, growling]  
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] They’re on their way. 
 Right. 
 I’ll start. 
 Hear me, o merciful Earth Mother. 
 Please protect us, the weak,  with your divine light and the sacred power of nature! 
 Protection! 
 [grunting]  
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] That’s quite a useful  new miracle you’ve been granted. 
 Six dead. 
 The rest will most likely burn inside. 
 Yes. 
 It just seems wrong to use the miracle  the Earth Mother bestowed upon me in this way. 
 To do harm to other living beings. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] They might have a back door  or another escape route. 
 Stay on guard. 
 I can’t believe that’s what you’re thinking about right now. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Imagination is a weapon. 
 Those who lack it are the first to die. 
 [PRIESTESS] Just like the ones who take quests  without considering the consequences. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Precisely. 
 [PRIESTESS] Great Earth Mother. 
 Why did you bestow this miracle upon me? 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Now we don’t have to extinguish the fire. 
 When it dies out,  we’ll hunt down those who survived the blaze. 
 We can’t let any of them live. 
 Not everyone may appreciate what you do,  but you save so many lives by hunting  those disgusting monsters. 
 I hope you’re as proud of yourself as I am. 
 Not just anyone can become a silver-ranked adventurer. 
 [grunts]  
 [screeches]  
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Just as I suspected. 
 I’m not what they expect of a silver rank. 
 Morning! 
 Thanks for your patience, everyone. 
 I’ll now be posting all the available quests for today! 
 [MAN] Time to make some coin. 
 -[door opens] -Huh? 
 Hmm? 
 [COW GIRL] Welcome back. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Thanks. 
 How about something to eat? 
 I can get a quick lunch ready. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Sure. 
 [COW GIRL] I’ll make this one extra delicious for you. 
 [GOBLIN SLAYER] Great. 
 The Goblin Slayer swung his blade fierce wretchedness  and now would purify. 
 Goblin corpses he cut through as their heads flew high. 
 O, courageous warrior with a sword  that’s tempered in perfect silver. 
 Never will the blade betray its purpose or its way. 
 Wielded by a master who will wander for always. 
 And finally, the goblin king’s reign comes to an end. 
 Relieved to be free,  the beautiful maiden leans in for a kiss. 
 However, he is the Goblin Slayer. 
 Sworn to wander, spilling monsters’ blood,  never to settle down. 
 The princess reached out but found only air. 
 Following destiny the Goblin Slayer  left without looking back. 
 [song ends]  That’s “The Stronghold Up in Flames”  from “Goblin Slayer: The Brave Warrior from the Frontier.”   
 -Thus ends our tale for now. 
 -[applause]  [WOMAN] Sir. 
 That adventurer you were singing about. 
 Does he really exist? 
 Why, yes. 
 Of course he does. 
 You’ll find him living in the frontier city  which is about two or three days’ ride to the west. 
 [WOMAN] Thanks. 
 [gasps]  So we’ve found Orcbolg.
