 Previously on Girlfriends Guide to Divorce... 
 Jake dropped a huge bomb on me yesterday. 
 Becca is pregnant. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I almost made out with my boss. 
 What? 
 Frumpkis? 
 Hey, Jo. 
 Who the hell are you, and what have you done with my fat, dirtbag ex? 
 I closed on a house. We're moving here. 
 I want to be closer to Zooey... me and Charlene. 
 Over my dead body! 
 I want to move in with Dad. 
 What? 
 I respect you, and I value our professional relationship... 
 Harris just stood me up. 
 You went on two dates with the doctor. 
 You didn't show up tonight. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Go home, Abby. 
 [phone rings] 
 _ 
 [ringing] 
 Lilly, could you get that please? 
 [ringing] 
 Lilly? 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Mom. 
 Hey, honey. How's it going over there? 
 Yeah, she's cranky  that she has to hang out with her little brother. 
 This is supposed to be my time with Dad before he goes away. 
 We were supposed to do something fun... just us. 
 I know, but I have to go to this event in New York to sell my book. 
 You didn't even write it yet. 
 The ABC is where you go to promote your book so that the booksellers  can decide if they like it and want to sell it. 
 Okay, you know what? Not the point. 
 He's your brother, Lilly, and it's only for two days, so nut up. 
 I need to talk to your dad. 
 Dad. 
 Hmm? 
 Hey. 
 Sorry to leave you with all that. 
 Please, you are so not. 
 Free trip to New York, six hours on a plane,  business class, come on. 
 Busted. 
 I was so looking forward to six hours with a Xanax 
 and a warm chocolate chip cookie, 
 _ 
 but I think I spaced and I think I put 
 _ 
 my pills in my Charlie's bag. 
 Oh, my God. 
 That's why I called. You have 
 _ 
 to get it out of there. 
 _ 
 Oh, sh... 
 Hey, they have a childproof cap... 
 Hello? Jake, are you there? Hello? Jake? Yeah, I got 'em. God, there's too much in my brain. Um, can you... can you talk for a minute real quick? Oh, no, I have to jump. Sorry, can it wait? [thud] Lilly, stop it. Charlie, Lilly! What? Jake? Yeah, everything's fine. Um... Okay. Have a great trip. Okay. Stop it! Lilly! My truck! I thought this was a sweat lodge. Oh, no, those are so inefficient. With this intensive infrared heat, you will experience detox, calorie burn, and emotional health. I prefer to burn calories the Puerto Rican way, by screaming at people. Jo, give heat a chance. Why? Why can't we just bitch at room temperature? Because you need to de-stress. You've been going through a lot. Me too. I'm starting SMC this week. Look at you, college girl. What are you taking? Gender Now! Women's studies. I'm easing into it with something I get, and plus, I'm like a hundred years older than the rest of the students, so I think I have an advantage. Yeah, you know, being more mature has its up sides. You don't have to join a sorority. Or do keg stands. Ignore her. Just try to keep it in your pants for one semester. You're there to work. God, why do I sound so judgey? Because, ah, hypocrite, you are sexually harassing your boss. Oh, yeah, how was the fallout with Albert? So nothing. We never kissed. It was just 'cause we were working closely on a sperm case. It was practically work p0rn. Did you tell Gordon? Honestly, I've had zero time to tell Gordon anything. [gasps] I'm moving into his place next week. Okay, either my ears are melting or I just heard you say "I am rushing things with Gordon because I almost played hide the pastrami with little Albert." Jo, maybe you should just chill out. What? I can't in this burning space burrito. I've had it. This is ridiculous. I'm over this. Frumpkis's Oh. new wife is coming to the bakery today, and this whole "Have a nice attitude toward the person who effed up your life" is bullshit. You have to... for Zooey. Okay, are we done here? Because I'm really over people telling me what is good for me. Jo, we just got here. Oh, my God. Okay, just unplug me. Oh! Girls... okay, I'm over it. I've got this. I've got this. [rock music] ♪ ♪ What are you doing? Cleaning up for our guests. It's Frumpkis and Scarlett O'Whore-a, not Prince Henry and Kate. It's just a quick hello to let Zooey know that we can all be in the same room together without it turning into the Red Wedding. Mm-hmm. I'll hide the knives. Charlene, this is my mom. Hi! Hi. Oh, can I just say it is truly lovely of you to have me here? It... it makes sense for us to all be adults here... for Zooey. Absolutely, but Zooey, darling, you didn't do justice to this place. It's so... gritty. So you guys just moved to Hancock Park, huh? They let Jews in there now? That's amazing. Oh, we got the most embarrassing white colonial. I told Robert, I said, "A southern person cannot be living there," but he just didn't listen. [chuckles] Robert, okay. Yeah, it's right near the tennis club, so Zooey can actually walk to her lessons. Hold on, you guys have lived here ten minutes, and you already joined a club? Frumpki don't play tennis. But Zooey's a natural. Oh. You should come for lunch one day and watch. I will check my iCal. [Southern accent] Sort of busy during the day running a bakery and all, you know? Oh, and you must be the sweet genius, Scott. Oh, my goodness, what are those? I need one in my mouth right now. I call these Bite-Me Pops. That is so wrong. Ooh, oh, they are just so naughty. [giggles] Ooh, mmm, mmm, they are just divine. Robert, honey, you've got to... mm-mm-mm. No, I don't... oh, okay. [giggling] [muffled] That's good. Mmm... yum-yum. It just feels like a sin not to have them with a nice big glass of cold milk. [giggles] Mm, you know what would be the cutest idea? A milk machine, you know, like a soda machine but with pint-sized bottles of milk? What do you think? Oh... I think that's great. Yeah, me too. I will put it in... the suggestion box. Great suggestion. Great, great. Right there. [laughing] Oh! You are hilarious. All right, all right, we will let you get back to the grindstone. I truly hope you will find some time to come and have lunch with us at the club soon. [hip-hop music] ♪ ♪ Ma'am. Right this way. Cat! Darling! Hey! How you doing? Hi. Hi. Wow, this place is mobbed. Oh, yeah, every YouTube star or their star pet is here hawking some book or other, which is why we need to get yours to pop. Can I get a photo? Thank you. We need to get the chains to order, like, 100,000 copies of your book, minimum. No pressure. No, no, no, you're gonna be fine. We've gotten you invited to some really good events where you'll go and do that Abby thing that you do. Oh, before I forget, here's your welcome kit. Welc... oh, Helen Fielding. Go get her! Helen, Helen! Harris, hi. Hi. What are you doing here? I'm here for the conference. I'm selling my book. You have a book coming out? Did I know that? "Global House Calls." I spent a year visiting the most unhealthy countries in the world. Hey, sorry about the other night. I... We're good for 8:00 at Clocktower. Oh, perfect. Oh, Abby, this is my friend, Deb Adler. She does modern acquisitions at Christie's. This is Abby McCarthy. She's another writer at Random House. Hi. What sort of books do you write? I write "The Girlfriends' Guide" series. It's a how to survive, ah, pregnancy, marriage, and now divorce. I will... look them up if I ever indulge in one of those... rites of passage. [chuckles] So I'll see you tomorrow. Uh... The nonfiction panel? We're... we're on it. What? Oh, my God. I didn't even have a chance to look at the program. I passed out on the plane. I just... carpool emails and free champagne. It's a lethal combo. [laughing] Ha-ha! Well, I look forward to paneling tomorrow. "Paneling"? [groans] Ugh! Non-fiction: How "Non" Is It? Let's just deep dive in. Do you ever feel a pressure to make your narratives more dramatic to sell books? Uh, I don't have to make up anything. I-It... it seems that whenever I land in a village, it just so happens to be the day of a national power outage or a slight tsunami. [scattered chuckles] What about you, Abby? How do you find the drama? Oh, my drama is homegrown, locally sourced, and sustainable, because it never ends. [laughter] My special talent is doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, which people love. [laughter] He attracts drama. You generate it. You should work together. [crowd murmurs, chuckles] All righty, questions from the room? Yes? For Ms. McCarthy, how do you stay so thin? Is it the divorce diet? Um, some women do seem to shed pounds when they get divorced. Maybe it's carrying the heavy weight of emotional issues that helps you burn more calories. I don't know. [laughter] Here's a tip, though. Don't clean your kids' plates with your mouth. [laughter] Ah, young gentleman in the back? Um, I follow you two on Twitter, and it seemed like things were heating up. Now, was that fiction or non? Ah, we've had a few professional dinners. It's really nothing really to text home about. We're not... dating. [school bell rings] All right, come on, kids. Let's go. We're late. Hey! Hey! Yo, what's eating you? Aside from the face lice. I'm trying to get in touch with Abby, who is in New York and never answers her phone. Everything okay? No, but you're not the person I can talk to about it. Thanks. Huh, okay. It's gonna be all over TMZ that Becca Riley is having a baby... my baby. Ay Dios mio! Idiota! Abby told you? Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to know So... that you know that I... Whatever. I can't keep track where the secrets begin and end with you two. I'm sorry. Okay, but the kids... The kids don't know, and now they have to, and it's not exactly the way I wanted to have the birds and the bees conversation with Charlie. He still thinks kids come from, you know, peeing in a girl's ear. Just tell them. Don't be a pussy. You know, when I grew up in the Bronx, we didn't have all these, "Oh, no, I dropped my FroYo" problems. We had real problems like no medical and... and government cheese, but my mother, she always pointed out the bright side. Here's how you tell the kids: more people equals more love. It might not be the way you planned it, but you always have to make room in your hearts for the new. Could I be... a bigger bullshitter right now? Well, what do you mean? I was with you on that. Keep going. Frumpkis shows up at the bakery yesterday with Charlene. Is she bad? Oh, she's the worst. She's... she's cuddly and uber-blonde Ugh! and was calling Frumpkis "Robert" Oh! and has all these fun ideas Oh, no! and kept pushing me to come and have lunch at the club. Screw that blended family sh1t. I'm not blending in for anyone. You know what? Charlene's in your life and in Zooey's, so you don't be a pussy. Go have lunch at the club, and I will have the talk, if I can ever get in touch with Abby. Hey, Albert? Hi. Um, can I borrow you for a sec? Always. Okay. Ready to crush it in court tomorrow? Not exactly. I, uh, would like to remove myself from the case. Um, the depositions are in order. Paul and Dan have pulled together a ton of precedent. They can argue this as well as me. That's actually not true. Dare I ask why? Look, I can't do this. I'm not a cheater. I don't know how I let it happen. Hey, don't feel so guilty. When you've worked together as long as we have, you can sometimes develop a... unexpected connection. Delia, it was a first offense. I think we can let ourselves off with a warning. Okay. Really hope Gordon can be as understanding. Gordon? Yeah, I'm gonna tell him tonight. What? I'm not on board with that. Well, I'm not gonna mention any names, but I can't start a new life with a lie. Welcome to Gender Now! I'm Professor Harper, and we're gonna kick things off with a pop quiz. [students groaning, mumbling] Now, the quiz is only one question: "Do you consider yourself a feminist?" Show of hands, feminists. You, please state why. I believe in a woman's right to equality. [groans] [scattered chuckles] As a member of the LGBTQA community, I cannot support feminism as long as they continue to use the word "v*g1n*." What's wrong with the word v*g1n*? It's exclusionary to the trans community and offers an extremely narrow view on womanhood. The correct terminology is "front hole" or "internal genitalia." Correct to... to who? The Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans Questioning Allied community. The "Q" is for queer? If you insist on using the word v*g1n*, But you need to have a v*g1n* to get you're labeling yourself a TERF. pregnant or have an abortion. You're clinging to a binary view of gender. That's just old. Says who? Okay, okay, I'm sure we can all see that feminism is a term deeply rooted in historical, racial, and sexual perspectives. Our goal in this class is to strip the word of all of its charged language, embark on a new dialectic, and to that end, your first homework assignment will be a self-examination, to draw yourselves as you see yourself... Naked. Harris, I was hoping to catch you. Look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that the panel went to such a weird, personal place. Yeah, it's not my comfort zone. Yeah, well, it might have been a little less weird if you had talked to me about our nonexistent relationship status before announcing it to the rest of the world. Abby, basically, from when we last saw each other, I thought it was pretty clear that we're not on the same page. When I showed up to your house after the prom. Okay, I know that seemed pretty... Very stalkery. Just... I messed up. I blew it. I just thought you would forgive me one mistake. Abby, I like you. I really do. It's just that I'm trying to stay away from the drama right now, that's all. And I'm just some crazy, obsessive chick, according to you. I didn't say that. Well, I may be dumb, but I'm not blind. Well, I'm not dumb either. You guys are an item. Finally there's something I can work with. We just had a Twitter fling. There's nothing going on here, Cat. Come on, don't bullshit a bullshitter, please. Excuse me, who are you? That's my editor. Oh, naturally. I can assure you there is nothing here to promote. And who are you, Salman Rushdie? Even he had the sense to hook up with Padma. Look, when you guys are done having your little lovers' tiff or whatever it is you've got going on here, then why don't you just text me, and we can sell some books, okay? Meh. Did she just say "meh" or "meth"? Uh, you really never know with her. Look, I'm sorry we just got off on such a weird foot. Can we... just skip to being friends? I don't think men and women can be friends. I think it's always a lie. Did you just quote "When Harry Met Sally"? I love that movie. Abby, I can't be friends with you because I want to have s*x with you. But it seems you have a lot going on, so... I really don't. [cell phone buzzes] I'm sorry, one second. Got a text. [buzzing] [beep] Ex emergency at home. Sorry. [line ringing] I... Okay. So maybe I do have a lot... okay. Jake, what is it? A lot of LaserBrite smiling in this joint, huh? That part of the dress code? Oh, they give away awards for having a trophy wife. Look at that. This is the oldest club in LA. Oh! All the classic tennis players came here. Yeah? Pancho Gonzales, Arthur Ashe, and there's an awesome picture of Chrissie Evert in the ladies' room. Mija, how do you know these names? Forget it, why am I asking? [both] She knows everything. Jinx. [both chuckling] Ah, are you ready to bring the pain? Yes. Good. I have a cancellation, so you win the lottery. Bonus time for my favorite new student. I'll see you guys later. Yeah, but she hasn't eaten lunch. Oh, that's all right. I'll send some chicken fingers down to the court. Make that two orders. I want to watch where I can hear. His accent kills me. [with accent] I think I have bro crush. Or a pro crush. [both laughing] Mwah. Mwah. [soft lounge music] ♪ ♪ Okay, too many layers of weird to count, but I gotta say my baby does look kinda... Kind of fab in that tennis dress you got her. Thank you. Oh. Thank you so much. Look at these old-school menus. Who knew they served tuna melts in LA, the kale capital of the world? They literally spray the grill with lard. Yeah? No healthy Rize treats here. Oh, that bakery is such a gem. You know, I have all these big ideas I'd just love to share with you on how to realize its full potential. Um, that... that's really thoughtful, but I don't need help. Oh, but it would be so much fun, and Robert is presently a co-owner at the bakery, you know. ♪ ♪ Actually, Frumpkis never gave a crap about the place. It's always been my thing. Yeah, ever since, ah, I found Scott at that Brooklyn farmers' market. Jo, it was Robert's money that funded the bakery. In the State of California, that makes it... half ours. But this kind of talk is so unpleasant. We should just order. I'll tell you what's really unpleasant. What I'm gonna do to you if you don't keep away from my babies... the bakery, and my kid. [whispers] Mine, yeah. Wow... now this is some provocative work, huh? Who's next? Jill, please share next. I chose to draw myself from behind because as a person of color, I have an issue with booty culture: booty calls, booty rap, the commodification of the black woman's ass. [students murmuring, chuckling] Deleting "Anaconda" from my playlist right now. [scattered chuckles] Phoebe, this is a collage of fashion photography. The assignment was to conduct a self-examination. It sounded very gynecological. [chuckles] It is a self-examination. Those are all images of me from different magazines. Oh, well you're a professional model? I was, yes, and it gives you a very fragmented self-image, the way people look at you like you aren't even there, criticizing your face and your body like it doesn't even belong to you. Are you trying to sell yourself as the victim here? I mean, aren't you more the perpetrator? I'm not a perpetrator. And in fact, I just walked off a shoot because I feel like they need to present women as real. Come on. You never had Botox? That has nothing to do with anything. I-I've been objectified my whole life. I just don't understand how you can be a feminist and a plastic person. Okay, people, let's not make things personal. Besides, that is a whole other lecture. Moving on... to... Naomi. Tell me about your piece. Well, I used the colored Sharpies to highlight the stretch marks on my thighs... 
 
 [rock music] ♪ ♪ Do they even have divorce in France? Or do they just get a mistress and look the other way, or Mister-ess for the ladies? I've always hated the word "lover," right? [cell phone buzzing] Sorry, I have a FaceTime call with my family. Excuse me. Okay, so here we... Okay, here comes Mom. Hi, guys. Hi, Mom. Hi, Mom. [giggles] Um, Daddy and I wanted to get the whole family together because we have some news. You know how we always say that family is just a bunch of people that  love each other? Well, we are gonna have someone new... Abby? What happened? Daddy, else then? Oh, it froze. Hold on. What'd she mean, someone new? What happened? Hold on, hold on, just let her... Abs? Are you there? Here you go. You guys... [grunting] Hel... uh... [stuttering] Uh, all right... She's just trying to tell you that you're gonna have a little brother or sister coming. Yay, Dad and Mom are getting back together! No. Oh, my God, you are? No, no, no. 'Cause Daddy and Becca are having a baby. Becca? Yeah. You're marrying Becca? No, uh, no, I'm not marrying Becca, but there's still a baby coming. No! Uh, when two people love each other... Don't you have to be married to make a baby? What she was gonna say... No, no, people can... when people  love each other, even for... She's explaining it. Um, uh,  a short time, it... it's enough to... Abby? Um,  for a... I don't know what you're talking about. Dad stuck his pen1s in Becca's v*g1n*. It's called s*x. Lilly! You don't have to love someone to do it. Lilly... Ugh! Abby... Ugh! Aah! ♪ ♪ Sorry to interrupt, Ms. McCarthy. We were just wondering if you could promote the book in France. Oh... [laughs] I love France. You can talk about the divorce diet. Oh, the fabulous divorce diet. I just FaceTimed with my family in a restroom, and I lost two pounds. [silent laugh] That's the whole thing. I'm an emotional bulimic. Emotional bulimia. Now, that's a disease we need to discuss. Sounds like a good segment for CNN, doesn't it? [polite laughter] Want to go? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Good night. I'm so sorry. I'm... think I'm... I'm losing it. I had to tell my kids about... the baby. It was a nightmare, and I'm not there to clean up the mess, and now I'm involving you... again. Don't apologize. Like I said, I'm a drama magnet. [scoffs] Let's go over to Ninth Avenue. This is a cab desert. Whoa! [Car horn honks] [honking, wheels screeching] ♪ ♪ You know what? Actually... I really appreciate the save back there, and now I'm done being rescued.

Mm-mm. That's because you haven't tasted my chicken fesenjan, which you are going to love. [sigh] Listen, working on this project with Albert has made you very happy. Mm? Hm... Please... un-quit. Okay. Okay. I have to... tell you something, and... We're gonna need this. Okay. [sighs] [cell phone buzzes] [beep] Hello? Jake, oh, my God. I've been trying to reach you.

And what about Lills? She's fine. I'm handling it, but  it's a lot to take in, as you know. I just feel like that whole FaceTime thing, it was just such a bad... Abby, stop. Abby, it's not Sorry. Okay? You know what, I'm going to my hotel room, and hotel rooms make me tense. Room service, bad movie... try to get some sleep. We'll see you tomorrow, all right? Bye. [beep] So what are we talking about? It's just... it's something that I've been wanting to tell you. I just wasn't... sure how you'd react, but I'm saying it now because it's not an issue. I just wanted to tell you that I had a... An engagement before you. [exhales] You did? I know, I know. I made it, like, seem like this big deal, and it was my first time down this road. But I was reluctant, to because my first fiancé cheated on me. What? Yeah. Well, how could he do that to you? Because people cheat for all kinds of reasons. They're just... sometimes they're working something out, right? Okay. I think I know what this is about. [sighs] You do? Yeah. You're afraid I'm gonna cheat. [sighs] I swear to you that is not gonna happen, and I can say that for sure because I cheated on Courtney, and it was miserable. You did? Yeah, and I-I never told you, even as a lawyer, because I thought you would just write me off. And I just... me and Courtney were so broken, and I was flailing. I guess I was just... I was trying to get to the truth. I mean, all I can say is that... it's the best I could do at the time, but it won't happen again. Mm-hmm. [tsks] I think I can understand that. [tender music] [phone rings] Hey. Hi. I just wanted to make sure you made it back okay. Yup. I just find you a little confusing. God, I hate myself for doing this. Yeah, well, I'm... I'm kind of wondering  why you did. I mean, you made yourself perfectly clear. I can't stop thinking about you. It's my weakness: women with complicated lives, sexy heels. My first marriage kind of messed me up. Whenever I see a red flag, I shut down. So...  we can't be friends because you're afraid that I'm a carrier of the same soul-sucking virus? Precisely. Well,  you can always wear a surgical mask. Only  that? And the, um... and the shoe covers. You know, maybe we should be having this conversation in person. We're only eight floors apart.

Love you. ♪ ♪ I don't think you were trying to intimidate me the other day, but I'm a little sensitive about the divorce. Don't express it in the most diplomatic way. I'm guilty of that. So I was, uh, hoping we could have a redo and try to have an honest conversation. I appreciate that. Frumpkis and I are done. I get that. But sharing Zooey with another woman, especially one with highlights the size of buttery chunks, isn't exactly what I bargained for, but I'm trying. Here, okay? I get that. I get it.

[laughing] You are a funny lady. Well, I hate to rush, but I have to dash off to a silly team captains meeting at the club. Do your thing. Bye. [laughs] Charlene? Hmm? [clears throat] What the hell. Of course. Here. Oh... bye. Professor Harper? Hey, can I have a minute? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Were you looking for this? Uh, no, I don't need that anymore. That's actually why I'm here. Oh. I shouldn't have left class early the other day. I should have stayed and told you and everybody else what I think. Yes? I don't know. I'm not a 20-year-old millennial fluent in gender-normative whatever. I do know that feminism shouldn't be about attacking other women's choices. And by the way, you telling us to draw ourselves naked is exploitative and creepy, even if you're trying to expand our consciousness, which... I'm sure you were. You're giving me an A? I don't disagree with a thing you said. Occasionally I tumble over the edge of appropriateness. Thank you for that. Have you read Camille Paglia? No. Do you think I'd like her? I think you would. Like you, she's a feminist who's not afraid to fire back at the sanctimony. Just, uh... skip the rape-y parts. Noted. [tsks] Stuck in coach too, huh? Sorry, um, excuse me, hi. Would you mind switching seats with me? I'm also in the aisle. No, thank you. This seat's closer to the lavatory. Oh. I'm traveling with my baby. Abby, we can sit together. We don't have to talk. I've got work to do. Okay, sounds like a plan. [sighs] What's up? You wanting to have an F2F instead of a phoner makes me nervous. Am I getting billed extra for this? No. Okay. Jo, we hit a roadblock in your division of assets. I-I thought we were almost closed. Well, we were, but I got a call from Frumpkis's lawyer. Look, they want the bakery. They want the whole thing. They're demanding you cede your half, and they're not willing to discuss anything else until it's resolved. Okay, this makes no sense. I just met with her this morning. Mm-hmm. We had this emotionally mature conversation where she agreed to leave the bakery alone. Do you remember the conversation? What'd she say, exactly? Er, she said she understood why I would want to run the bakery without her. Mm-hmm. She was fine with it. Yeah, translation: she will run it without you. That two-faced, buttery-chunked she-devil. Mm-hmm. Yes. Freaking bitch. I just don't understand why he has the right to do anything. He's a fricking bigamist. And we will use that as leverage. Yeah. We can pursue punitive spouse, fraud... force him to reimburse the estate on all monies he spent on Charlene. Yeah. Let's bring that b*st*rd down. But all that includes fighting in court, which is expensive. No point in battling over a bakery that doesn't have the capital to keep it running. And it could be... ugly for Zooey. I don't want to drag my baby into this. So what do we do? You let me do my thing. I will negotiate. I will threaten the hell out of them. In the meantime, you... Lay it on me. Bring it on. Whatever it takes, bring it on. Play nice. [funky rock music] Shh. ♪ ♪ I mean, it is weird how the universe keeps throwing us back together. Like somebody up there loves us or hates us. [moaning] [thudding] Albert, hey. I wanted to talk to you. I want back in on the sperm case. I can really help out with Judge Gillian, I... Done. You had me at "Albert, hey." This is strictly a professional decision. It has nothing to do with our... Albert? I'm carrying an entire Japanese fishing boat of sushi. [giggles] Hi. Delia, I haven't seen you forever. Yeah. I know! Well, I've been meaning to congratulate you. Gordon Beech, I mean, come on. Let me see. [gasps] I need my sunglasses to look at this. Oh... [laughing] [Sherry giggling] It's really sweet of you to bring dinner for Albert. Yeah, it's the closest thing we get to date night. So see you in court mañana? You bet. I'm gonna get... touched up on those briefs. [thoughtful music] ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey. I know I was... I was supposed to keep them tonight, but I... I have a-a call in the morning with my DP who's in rehab, and I haven't done sh1t for it. And then I saw the TMZ thing, and I-I just fed them peanut butter and crackers for dinner, and then I lost the will to live, and we're out of milk. It's okay. Really? Mom? Hi, honey. Charlie wet your bed. What? He hasn't done that in years. Oh. I think he's probably regressing because of the baby news. I'll... you do this. I'll change the sheets. Just... could you? Thank you. No, I got it. I got it. Go home. And look in the mirror. It's all Ozark-y. It's like you're ready to pitch for the Dodgers. [pats back] Hey. Hey. Sorry about all the penises and vaginas. I think it made things worse for Charlie. It was a stressful situation, and sometimes we blow it. It happens. Why didn't you go home with your dad? I wanted to stay with Charlie and help him feel like things are more normal, and I guess for you too. For me? Yeah, I mean, are you okay with all this? I don't know. [chuckles] Are you? Yeah, I think it'll be kind of cool having a pet baby. You are insane. Come on, Mom. It's Becca Riley's baby. It's gonna be so cute. It's gonna be, like, Tumblr cute. You're Tumblr cute.
