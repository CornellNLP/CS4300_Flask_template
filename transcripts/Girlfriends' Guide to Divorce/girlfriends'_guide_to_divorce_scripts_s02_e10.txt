 Previously on "Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"... 
 We had a talk about seeing other people. 
 People should really get to know each other before you define who you are in a relationship. 
 Kind of forgot I'm living with the expert. 
 Albert's wife had us followed. 
 She has pictures of us in a hotel, and if Gordon finds out, my life is over. 
 I was diagnosed at 11. 
 Social anxiety disorder. 
 Doesn't that just mean you're shy? 
 Debilitatingly shy. 
 Who's gonna know? 
 I let somebody hurt me. 
 This psycho could have killed me. 
 What kind of mother does that? 
 This is Phoebe, my ex-wife. 
 Correspondents' Dinner is a big deal. 
 It's political nerd prom. 
 He didn't tell you he was going? 
 He did tease me about needing a date. 
 Maybe he didn't have a plus-one. 
 I can get out there and do what's good for the gander. 
 Meaning get laid. 
 I need a real man. 
 ♪ I know what I want ♪ 
♪ I ain't... ♪ 
 So I read your working draft. 
 Yeah, I thought that Cat with a "C" was reading it. 
 Yeah, well, you know, methamphetamine’s and words don't really go together. 
 Ok-ay. 
 So, you, a lot of good stuff in here. 
 Yeah? 
 Is that code for start over? 
 No. Oh, my gosh, no, no, no. 
 That chapter where you tell the kids? 
 Ah! Heartstring City. 
 Thank you. 
 And going back with Jake? 
 I loved... loved what you did there. 
 Thank you. 
 Ish. 
 Ish? 
 Can you be more specific? 
 Okay, sure, yeah, just a few notes here. 
 Oh, sh1t, do you believe this heat wave? 
 Since when did LA become the Middle East? 
 Right. Yeah, it's hot. 
 So, um, what are the notes? 
 Basically, um... 
 It's a lot of notes. 
 Um, yeah, just... Just dig deeper. 
 Give us more of the mess, the raw, gritty. 
 Gritty? 
 Gritty. 
 Hey, don't get defensive. 
 I'm just looking for my new Abby McCarthy. 
 A little less sunny, more authentic, real. 
 Right. You know what? 
 I am not... I'm not being defensive. 
 I just... isn't that what I did? 
 Well, kind of, but I mean, come on. 
 Where's Becca Riley? 
 I don't feel comfortable writing about that. 
 So change her name. 
 And Harris? 
 Harris is in there. 
 Oh, okay, yes, you did it on a plane, and you cried like a wittle tiny baby on a date. 
 It's your first serious relationship after Jake. 
 I mean, get inside of it. 
 Okay, I will get inside of it. 
 Could you maybe get inside fast, huh? 
 Kat, my deadline is already in a few weeks. 
 That's right, so hit that keyboard. 
 Go strike while the iron's hot. 
 Think I'm excited. 
 I think I'm excited. 
 I'm gonna go hit it.

♪ I never knew what it was like ♪ 
♪ So I'm holding tight to this feeling ♪ I love when you draw me. Makes me feel like Kate Winslet. Who? Kidding. I've seen "Titanic." [giggles] I'm not a... total weirdo. Well, I am, but I've seen "Titanic." [phone chimes] Um, just... I have to move for one second. Oh, sh1t! I forgot. Ralf is back from Berlin. He has to pick up the kids. Should I wake them? Oh. Honestly, JD, I think you should leave. Or hide. Meeting the ex is a lot. You mean, for someone with my condition? No, for anyone. And stop talking about yourself like that. You're fine. We already went over this. I am a weirdo with acute social anxiety, but you make me feel like I can beat it. Like I'm king of the world. Wow. Nice. Yeah. See? Told you I saw it. So tell me more about this... Ralf. Um, he owns hotels, self-made, killer business instincts, he's also a big player in the art world. I think I hate him already. No. He's not that bad. He's into impressionists. Total Monet guy. Hmm, now I like him. What else? Uh, he likes golf. He's a foodie. Loves going to new restaurants. Monet, food, golf. Got it. Got it. ♪ ♪ 
♪ I never felt this way before ♪ It's beautiful. You're beautiful. ♪ Don't know if I love you but I might ♪ 
♪ Baby baby ♪ 
♪ ♪ Jo. Hey. Morning. Hi. Hair looks nice. Thank you. Uh, we're running out of Faux-hos. The natives are getting restless. Yep, I'm whipping up a batch right now. Great. Is that a new top? Huh? Nope, just a regular old top. Part of the regular rotation. Wow. It looks very lovely. Oh, coffee. I am just brewing us a new batch of morning java 'cause I know that you are a dark roast kind of girl. That's it. Put the mug down. Did I, um... Did I do something wrong? Enough of the befuddled Brit act, Hugh Grant. When have you ever made me coffee? Never, that's when. You trying to be all gentlemanly because of my weak moment the other night? It wasn't weak. And you know, maybe I'm just acting like a gentleman because... You're not a gentleman. You're a slut. That's your thing, so just quit it with the complements and the smiling and the pity coffee. If you ever do need to talk to anyone... What did I just say? We're colleagues! I am business, you're creative. Capisce? Don't think I understand what "capisce" really means, but yes. I think I get your drift. So how was Berlin? Oh, the same. Beautiful, thrilling, better than this crazy LA heat. I know, it's been hot. JD, this is Ralf. Ralf, this is JD. Very nice to meet you, Ralf. JD is an extremely talented new artist that I've been working with. Well, wonderful to meet you, JD. An artist? What's your medium? Paint. I paint. So, um, I hear you're a big food guy. Have you tried that new Ethiopian restaurant on Fairfax? Uh, I haven't tried it. Not yet. Oh, but you must. It's so much deliciousness... Yeah. And bread and, um... Golf. How about that Jordan Spieth? He's a real ball-hitter. Yeah. [chuckles] So where'd you find this guy? You should see his art. It's just... It's electric. Aw, I don't know. Electric? So, JD, have you shown your work yet? Not yet. Still un-shown. Yeah, we're still trying to get him a foothold, but, uh, no luck. Art galleries aren't really calling us back, but, uh, we will... We will figure it out. Yeah. Well, uh, maybe I can stop by your studio, JD, uh, take a look, offer you any advice that I can. Oh, wow. Thank you. Oh, that would be amazing. That's very nice of you. I mean, if Phoebe responds so strongly, I'm sure that I will too. ♪ A painted face, shiny hair ♪ 
♪ And blue, blue eyes ♪ What happened to you? You look like you walked into a car wash. Back off. It's 7,000 degrees outside. I'm Puerto Rican. I sweat. My ass is so damp it feels like it's growing moss. Ugh. Thank you. What are we talking about? Phoebe had an ex-husband/new boyfriend encounter. No, not allowed to say boyfriend yet. He has to work for it. So, Jo, any non-boyfriends in your world? Yes, have you swiped any hotties lately? No, no more swiping. I'm on a break. Oh. From Tinder or from men? Both. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Hey, Abby, I texted. You never... I didn't know if you were coming. I know, I know. I suck. I just... I had to get these impossible-to-find vitamins for Becca and then I couldn't help myself and I got these. Look at this. Look at that. Oh, my God. That's from Erewhon? Yes. They are organic. They are a gender-neutral color. Love these. I still can't believe Jake shoots a load into a starlet and you're out shopping for her. Okay, inappropriate. Um, yes, it is odd, but Becca needs me, and the poor girl can barely get out of bed. Excuse me? Yes? Can I get an iced tea, please? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Abs, you should have something to eat. You know, I just came back from a meeting with my editor, which was very stressful and kind of zapped my appetite. And my deadline is practically here, and she wants the book even sooner, so... Well, don't stress. You'll get it done. Well, I better. Now she wants me to write about Harris. Um, you know, to get inside it and... Get inside what? Us, whatever that means. My recent adventure in non-monogamy. I don't know. I think I need to end it with Mr. Who-Do-We-Belong-To because clearly I am more of a monogamy kind of gal. Don't cut him loose before you talk to him first. I mean, you like him, right? I do. I mean, I've never really been with a guy like him. He's successful, he's mature, he's got this self-confidence that is so sexy. Mm-hmm. - Well, don't give up. And who says you have to have a relationship on his terms? That's so true. It really has been on his terms. It's been on his turf. He hasn't even been to my house. That house kills. Right? And he hasn't met us and we're amazing. You guys are amazing, exactly, and he hasn't even met my kids. You know what? I should not talk to him about being exclusive until he sees all the amazingness in my life. I need to see if he can handle all the amazingness in my life because it's... a lot. Well, he might surprise you. JD was a natural with my kids. JD has met Anouk and Luco? That's a little fast, no? Like you're shocked? The woman has no boundaries. Right here. And you know what? It felt right in my gut so I think you should do it. Throw the handsome doctor into the deep end and see if he sinks or he swims. Sink or swim, I like that. Yeah, I'm gonna un-non-monogamy Harris. Let's see if he's up to that challenge. I'm gonna "monogafy" him. [phone chimes] What? I just made up a word. Sorry, wait one sec. Becca. Vomiting's worse. I'm gonna take her to the doctor this afternoon. Will you guys excuse me for just a second? I, um... I just have to check on her. Do your thing. Hey. Is it just me or is this Abby-Becca thing a little... Does it seem a little... Single white mommy-ish? Yeah. No. Not at all. And I'm the one with the boundary issues. Well... Little bit. Little bit. ♪ ♪ They're incredible, aren't they? Mm, they are. Jarring, provocative. The genitalia in this piece, the impressionistic stroke. Yeah, that's... I was going for the sensation of seeing something in fast, quick cuts, like in a movie. Not that I watch a lot of edited, you know, content. Ah, we all watch a lot of content, mate. No worries. Um, I have this feeling. There is so a show here, right? Absolutely. You should move fast and bypass the galleries. Just throw something up on its feet. Downtown? Skid Row? Perfect. Art people love to feel like they're slumming it. You need a space that feels dirty, porn-y, low-rent. Like the sexuality in these pieces, how it... Taps into something raw. I know. Well, thank you so much for your encouragement. It means so much to us. Oh, of course. So are we doing this? We? What? You don't have to do this. Oh, I want to. It's not every day you find a major new artistic voice. Oh! That's very generous of you. Oh, you find the gallery space, I'll bring the rich art snobs. That's amazing. Wow. [phone rings] Hey, gorgeous. - Hey, you. Hey, listen. I'm sorry we haven't seen each other since I got back from D.C. Wow, I mean, I didn't even... I have been so busy. Um, so listen. Dr. Harris, you're next. How do you feel about art shows? Are we talking about caricatures in a park or in a gallery? A gallery, new guy, unknown. Um, my friend Phoebe just called. She's putting this whole thing together And then we're gonna do drinks beforehand at my house. You know, pre-art show drinks. It's just a few couples, super casual. - Um... Just like totally mellow. Mellow casual. Are you in? Definitely. I've been dying for the opportunity to be judged by your friends. Well, they are a super judgey bunch, so, you know, bring your A-game, baby. [mouths words] So, uh, your kids gonna be there? Actually, Lilly will be at a sleepover, but Charlie will be there. Is that okay? Hello? Yeah, of course. I've been looking forward to meeting him. I won't make a big deal out of it. We'll just say that you're Mommy's friend. Okay. Text me the details. I'm in. Okay. I'll see you soon. [phone beeps off] All right, the guy gives good phone. That's not the only good thing he gives. Oh, I should hope so. And it seems like he's down to get the girlfriend once-over. Good sign. Maybe this mofo's worth "monogafying." Oh, stop trying to make "monogafy" happen. No? It ain't gonna. Okay, you don't like that word. I actually have to go. I have, um... I have, like, a couple hours to write. I've got to get Becca to the doctor... Abby, all kidding aside, what is the deal with Becca? I told you. I'm helping her. She is a grown woman with a CW salary. She can take care of herself. You've been through enough sh1t. Remember, with the tears, when you thought you pregnant? Wow, this is not about that. I'm just saying be careful, you know? Don't try to Bogart her uterus. I am not trying to Bogart anyone's uteri. Okay? I know this seems crazy, but she really literally has nowhere else to go, and I hear you. I hear you. Hmm? Mm-hmm. Look, I have a protective emotional bubble around me. Okay. Look at that. Uh-oh. Moving through space. [chair clatters] Sorry. That didn't even affect me emotionally because I'm so safe. I like what I see. I like what I hear. Go write your ass off. Thank you. All right, bye. Bye, love you. [rock music] ♪ ♪ So... does anything seem off to you in any way? Let me guess, is it the pocket? This is our entire line. No one at the New York factory caught it. How do a dozen seemingly competent people in menswear design think that this... This is an intentional look? I mean, the stupidity of this thing is egregious! I'm so sorry, honey. You'll figure something out. I mean, can't the pocket just be re-sewn? No! There's literally thousands of these pieces, and we're already over-budget. I may have to push the fall launch! I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. I'm really frustrated. No, don't. This is... This is not the first screw-up. It's fine. It's fine. Blow off as much steam as you want. [sighs] Is there anything I can do? Nah, not really. I mean, not unless you want to help me decide who to fire. How about dinner... and a shoulder massage and a really, really stiff whiskey? Sounds about perfect. Yeah? You're too good to me, you know that? Oh! The AC feels amazing. Yeah. Okay. We've got migraine medicine and stronger meds for the nausea. Oh, could I grab some water? Of course. Thank you. So that's good the doctor said you're doing fine. He's such a liar. [chuckles] Um, he gave me a list of things that I need for your liquid diet. I'll go buy that tomorrow. Thank you. [sobs] Honey, what's the matter? You've just been so amazing. Like the mother I never had, and I have one. Abby, maybe I... maybe I should check into the hospital. No, we've been over this. It's too much to put on you. You've got your book and the kids, and Jake's in Latvia. I don't want to keep getting in the way. Hey, you're not in my way, okay? I... our situation is unusual, yes, but I want to help you, and I want to help the little troublemaker. And plus, I'm kind of in the death throes of baby fever here, so this is very exciting for me. Don't... don't deprive me. Okay. Really, it's not... Oh, God. I'm sorry. An imposition at all. [vomiting] It's not an imposition at all. Oh, God. Oh, God. I think... just take this one first. Here? Yeah. Please. Okay. And which one's Delia again? Delia, she's a divorce lawyer. Okay. Fierce, kick-ass. Um, she's a sweetheart though. She's gonna love you. Um, she's the one getting married, but don't bring up her wedding. She doesn't want to talk about it. Okay. Uh, Delia, lawyer, fierce, don't talk about wedding. Okay. Um, Jo has the bakery. She's a total hothead, and she'll probably insult you. But don't take it personally. And Abby's like Superwoman. She's a writer, successful, working on her latest book. Writer writing a book. JD, if this is making you more anxious, we can skip Abby's. We can relax at my house until the show. No, no, I need to meet them anyway. Might as well meet them before the show. It'll be a good warm-up. You sure? Yeah. Man of the hour. Hi. Now get ready for a crowd tonight. People are intrigued by this dangerous new provocateur I've been telling them about. [exhales sharply] Think I'm gonna take another loop around the block, settle my energy. Um, hey, JD? Tonight is gonna be great. And I'm gonna be by your side the whole time. Do not worry. Okay. So, the two of you. Is this a more recent development? Uh, JD and I? Yeah, it's recent, but special. I get it. Thank you. Different. So how's Carla? Is she still fabulous? Oh, she's good, she's good. Good. Yeah, she's not exactly thrilled I'm spending time with you. Yeah. I've explained it's just work, but, you know. Well, you tell Carla that she has nothing to worry about. I am spoken for. Of course. Understood. Good. 
 
 So, drinks? Art? Sounds like a very cosmopolitan evening. Uh, yeah, yeah, I guess. How many nut brittle scones should I bring? Like six? For drinks? Yeah. None, too heavy. But, you know, it's your party. Clearly. Oh, we're doing this? Are you pissed because you weren't invited? Don't be ridiculous. So what's with the sad puppy dog eyes? I have no idea what you're rattling on about, but my eyes are neutral. Human. Mm-hmm. I just think you're being unprofessional. Unprofessional? Yeah. You can't just give away our products to your friends, Jo. This is a business. We're business colleagues. I just think that we should behave in a professional business manner. [British accent] Well, all right. All right. [normal voice] Hey! What are you doing? Who would like to purchase some sesame strudels, hot out of the oven? Get them out! This is my bakery! Yeah? Well, these are my strudels. I made them! Fine, fine, keep them, you big baby! Jesus! [pensive music] ♪ ♪ No, 7:50 is good. Yeah. Book it. All right. I have to fly to New York in the morning. What? Oh, no, did something happen? No, we just have to reproduce all these defective shirts and that knocks us into budget hell, which means layoffs, and I got to go do the dirty work. You don't mind if I skip tonight, do you? I got a call later with my investors. Ugh. You just do the call at Abby's. Why are you pushing this thing? This is a... I'm not pushing. Anyway, it's your own charming fault that my friends like you so much, and it's kind of a couple's thing. All right. Fine. I'm just gonna change my shirt. ♪ Feeling the pain just like a mother's love ♪ Here you go. Anyway, there's 300 of them living in this tiny, tiny little village. It's remote, extremely remote, but beautiful. Can you imagine Harris hanging in Ecuador in a community of little people? [laughter] And they're all looking at me like I'm this giant freak. [laughter] But the funny thing is, they were trying to be nice, but I could tell they actually felt sorry for me. All : Aww. JD, we're so excited about your show. Phoebe has just been going on and on about your work. I have been super annoying about it. I brought my checkbook, so... Aw, that's so sweet... You don't have to buy anything. I just mean... no pressure, no pity purchases, you know. No, of course. What's your process? How do you decide what to paint? Well, it... Kind of hard to explain, um, word-wise. It's internal, um... [clears throat] Inside my brain space. [scattered chuckles] Um... But Delia, lawyer. Yeah. That's... so real, um, isn't it? [laughter] Helping actual people. I do mostly arbitration though. Divorce law. Yeah. Still has to be tricky dealing with all that, uh, animosity. Oh, you're telling me. But look at you, taking the leap. Marriage leap. Yeah. Oh, damn it, I wasn't supposed to talk about that. No, JD, it's fine. No, no, it's fine. I don't know why Phoebe said it wasn't because... I didn't. I just, um... Who would like some hors d'oeurves? I am starving. Because I have a tomato-burrata thing that I think you guys will really like. That would be great. Sounds delicious. Wonderful. Yummy, yummy... They're super tiny in honor of Ecuador. Sorry about that. That was... JD, you're doing great, okay? Okay. Okay, well, I'm so excited to see your show. I can't wait. Good luck. Break an arm, break a leg, paintbrush, whatever. I will be right there, okay? I meant to say something earlier. Harris... is fantastic. He totally delivers. Aw, thank you. So you think you've answered the whole sink-or-swim question? Okay, I think he's a swimmer. Yeah, I think so too. And JD. Yeah. Wow, he seems really great. He's a little awkward in... in crowds, but he's... he's really great. Yeah. Yeah, he's just... there's so much going on with the show. Of course. But he seems great. Yeah, he is. All right, well, I'll see you in a bit. Okay, good luck tonight. Bye. Bye, honey. Okay. Hey, How was the call? It's fine. Everything's fine. Sorry, everyone. Sorry, I need to catch up. I need a drink. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bourbon. Mama! Oh, hey, hey, hey. Wow, slow down. What, you want to hang out with the grown-ups for a bit? Mommy, I'm hungry. Feed me. Okay, I can make you a snack, but Uncle Ford is coming to pick you up, and then you're gonna go to dinner and then you're having a sleepover there. It'll be super fun. But I want to stay with you. I know. I know you do, sweetheart. Come... Wait a second. Charlie, you get to hang out with your uncle and your cousins all night? That sounds like a blast. Yeah. But it's not. Why not? They never let me pick the movie. [stomps foot] Ugh. That sucks. I grew up with older brothers. I never got to choose the movie. You have older brothers? Two. I was the baby. But you're so old. Charlie. Oh, my God. Go to your room. I'm gonna make you a snack. Don't worry. I don't like my room. I know. [thud and whirring] Oh, God, the AC? No, no, no, no. My armpits are already drenched. I think it's God's way of telling us it is time for us to go look at some porn-y art. We can't go anywhere. Abby's got to wait for Charlie to get picked up. _ And then we can go look. [whines] That's not my problem. And what about Becca? I can't leave her in the guest house with no AC. Oh, God, I got to check on her. Becca? Becca? Becca Riley's living in the guest house? Oh, yeah. Six days, I'm trapped in this Egyptian Village. This drink saved my life. Oh, so "English Patient." Were you trapped in a Nazi jeep during a sandstorm with someone else's hot, horny wife? Look, I'm putting peas in my pants. Oh, don't mind the little weirdo. Keep talking. Oh, my God. AC update: The guy is on his way. I had to play the whole pregnant CW star card. I am not proud. And Becca is fine. Yay. Um, how's everybody holding up? How about you lose my invite for your next event? First it was Thanksgiving and now it's this, and I think the next time we're just gonna be sucked into, like, this Hellmouth. [laughs] Well, just thank you for hanging in there. Mommy! Harris has been to a real volcano before, with lava. Wow, that is really cool. I'll get a drink for you. Might not have any lava in it, but it'll do the trick. Thank you so much. Please get out of there and save energy, Charlie. No! Oh, my God. Yes. Mmm. I'm sorry, by the way, about the whole AC thing and my kid. God, God, no worries. No worries. You've had anything to eat? Mmmmm. Not yet, but I'm gonna get to it. This is crazy good. It's great, isn't it? Rum, some basil, some ice, some Becca Riley. Becca? Yeah. I guess I failed to mention that she was staying in the guest house. Yeah, you did. That's some new information. How long she gonna be staying? Oh, just till the baby comes. Good God, is this a sweat lodge? It's hotter than Hades in here. Sorry. Deepest apologies. Sorry for the intrusion, but I couldn't deny you lovely people a taste of my famous minty s'mores. Well, that's amazing. Look at that, Charlie. You want one? Knock yourself out, mate. Just that one. I have to take this. Oh, here, you can have my peas. Aw. Oh. Thanks. Well, we're going to an art thing after the AC repair guy gets here, so if you want to come, you're welcome to come. Absolutely, yeah, if that's okay with everyone. Like we have a choice. You come in here bearing gifts, of course she's gonna invite you. Jo. Just have a nibble, please. I'm Harris. Dr. Harris. Yeah, it's a pleasure. What's going on? Well, I'm just calling out a party crasher. I know you can't stand the guy. When he was living in a tent in my backyard and tossing out my food, but look, he's really trying. I mean, he may actually mean well. You should be a little easier on him maybe. Mmm-mmm. You have to try. This is good. Just have a little nibble. Yeah, we got to go. Okay, well, we'll go to JD's thing and, God, I hope... No, no, we got to go home. They have air conditioning. I'm dripping sweat. I have, like, 12 unanswered emails I got to deal with. Gordon. Phoebe's gonna be so upset. I told her we were gonna stop by. Delia, we're going home. Now. Okay. Okay. Uh, you guys, I'm so sorry. Something's come up with Gordon. We have to go. Sorry. Sorry, everyone. It's my fault. Sorry. I got work. No, you have to stay. Have some minty s'mores. Work can wait. Actually, it can't. I have to catch a plane... Is it because of the heat? Because we can go in the pool and cut them up and have minty... Abby, back off. We're leaving. Um... I get that, so I will... I will see you out. Delia. Is everything okay with you two? It's the heat. I mean, everyone's irritable. Yeah, I just want to make sure you're not giving him a pass because you feel guilty about what happened with your boss. I think you're reading too much into the Albert thing, okay? Could you apologize to JD and Phoebe for me? I need to go home. Okay. [dance music] ♪ ♪ You ready? Mm-hmm. ♪ ♪ There you are. Oh. I cannot believe there are so many people here. No one shows up on time in Los Angeles. Because they all want a jump on the competition. I can even smell a few sales, some potential buyers. Already? Wow, that's... Impressive, yes. I will say, though, there's momentum building and I'd hate to change the dynamics. Change the dynamic? What do you mean? It's just an idea. Let's not introduce JD as the artist. Let's run with the enigma thing. Hear me out. See, right now you're still an unknown quantity. You're mysterious, okay? Let these people's imaginations go wild. 'Cause if they meet you, it might, you know, diminish that effect. Huh. What do you think? It's up to you. It's your show. But you think it's a good idea? It worked for Banksy, right? ♪ ♪ Okay. If you think so. Great. All right, Phoebe, let's go sell some art. ♪ ♪ [door closes] I think that's the sexiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Just trying to get a head start for you.

Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. By the way, I think you have a new number one fan. Charlie could not just now stop talking about how awesome you are. He's a cute kid. Yeah. Listen, Abby... No, don't talk.

♪ Baby yo ♪ Sorry I was such a bitch before Sacking off and bringing all this stuff was a very nice thing to do. It's my pleasure, but please, no apology is needed. So, should we go check out this art p0rn thing? Sounds like it's right up my alley. No kidding, right? Why are you acting this way with me? All of a sudden? Goodness, have I really been that awful? Stop, you know what I mean. Right from day one, our lightly acidic workplace dynamic has been part of the appeal. But that doesn't mean that we can't occasionally be real with each other, right? [sighs] That talk that we had the other night. Mmm. And the hugging and sh1t... with a man. Which I am. Feels really unnatural... and risky for so many screwed-up reasons, Frumpkis-related and otherwise. Robby really did a number on you, didn't he? Oh, yeah. When you, um, when you told me about that guy the other night, the choker? I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was tracking this guy down and beating the bloody hell out of him. Well, that's very nice, but I don't want you to lose sleep over me. What if I want to? Excuse me? What if I care about you, Jo? But... why? [gentle music] ♪ ♪ ["Feel So Classic" by The Knocks] ♪ ♪

I just hope we didn't make a mistake. [sighs] Nah, this was the right call. JD's brilliant but he's not exactly a self-promoter. You jump-started his career tonight. You think so? Oh, I know. I've been so impressed... watching you work the room, talking about the art and so passionate. You take my breath away. Ralf, don't. I miss you. We're with other people now. I can't... Yeah, but are we with the right people? Please, just give me a minute. Can we go somewhere and talk? Where are you going? Home. It's... it's late. Can you tell Phoebe and JD I'm sorry? Uh, okay, yeah. Are you... are you mad at me because I had to go and deal with Becca? No, no, I'm not. I think what you're doing for Becca is extremely generous. But... But I also think it's a little nuts. Ah, okay, yeah. It's unorthodox, but Becca, she needs me. Yeah, you don't have to justify it. Your life, it's very packed, it's full. Well, I am a single mom, yeah. Having Becca move in, it's like throwing gasoline on the fire, then you host me, everybody else, while you already have so much on your plate, plus you got a book due? I'm aware of my deadline, Harris, thank you. And I'm allowed to... Okay, you know what? [clears throat] What is this really about? Are you needing more time from me? It's nothing. Let's just talk about it tomorrow. No, no, I want to talk about this right now. It's kids. What? I don't mean your kids. You know, Charlie's great and I'm sure Lilly is great too, and you're an amazing mother. I knew that. But knowing it and then seeing you with them... I thought tonight went great. I mean, Charlie loved you and the two of you... Abby, this isn't personal. I'm taking responsibility here 'cause the truth is, my life... and I'm trying to be honest here... I just don't think you're capable of accommodating my needs. Because I have children. In part, yes. I mean, I travel constantly, I'm under enormous pressure... Okay, that's enough. I get it, stop. [somber music] ♪ ♪ You know what? I have been driving myself crazy trying to make this whole thing work, and, uh, I'm not even sure I like you. I'm sure I like the way we, uh... We look together. That's kind of a low blow. No, it isn't. Here's a low blow. You tell yourself that you are looking for a real woman who's your age and your equal, but what you really want is an audience... front and center for your fabulous life, so you should just go get that because that sure as hell isn't me. Seems like we're done here. Abby? Something's wrong! I think something's wrong with the baby. She's in labor! She'll be okay. We just have to get her to the hospital. Oh, my God! Keep the goddamn couch, Jo. It's yours. [door closes] Um, I - I called Jay I left him a voice-mail. Harris is talking to the doctor right now. Abby? Abby, what if I lose the baby? You're not gonna lose the baby. I promise. But you don't know. I do. I do. It's just... it's gonna be fine. I can feel it. Hey, I'm not going anywhere, okay? I am right here for you. Okay. We're gonna do this. Oh, God. Gordon, I need a minute. Yeah, just a second. Let me finish these projecti... No. No. I'm really sorry that I made you go to Abby's. I know that you were really stressed out, but the way that you acted tonight... Hey, Delia... No, let me finish. It was not okay. You really embarrassed me. All right, you're right. I'll call Abby in the morning and apologize. It's just, all this... all this. It's all my fault. The shirts is just one in a long line of screw-ups. I can't keep blaming other people. You can't be there every second to hold people's hands. Yeah, but I need to be there more than I am now. I just can't stand being apart from you. I feel guilty when I'm there. I feel guilty when I'm here. I mean, this whole thing is just eating me up. What if we moved there? New York? I thought New York made you claustrophobic, like you're living in the world's fanciest ant farm. It's not my favorite, but just for a few months after the wedding. I mean, you could launch the line and iron out the kinks, and I could work from the New York office. And your firm would be okay with that? Yeah, I'm sure that Albert would sign off on it.
