 Previously on "Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"... 
 I'm sad, and I'm tired, and I'm stressed. 
 [retches] 
 Take a frickin' break. 
 I can't, Jo. I cannot. 
 I just need to finish my book this week. 
 I am so close to being done. 
 I was diagnosed... Social anxiety disorder. 
 Doesn't that just mean you're shy? 
 Debilitatingly shy. 
 I thought that we weren't getting emotional. 
 Well, then we should've thought about that before you stuck your funky love cruffin inside of my pastry box. 
 What you really want is an audience for your fabulous life. 
 So you should just go get that because that sure as hell isn't me. 
 It seems like we're done here. 
 Charlene... she left me. 
 Wait. What? 
 For that goddamn German tennis pro. 
 Because I love you. 
 I only want to be with you too. 
 What about you and Gordon? 
 I'm sick and tired of playing along with this perfect-wedding crap. 
 This whole thing has just been a crock since you started screwing Albert. 
 If you're gonna marry anybody, I want it to be me. 
 I'm sorry, Albert. 
 Don't diminish this. 
 Albert, be reasonable. 
 You're telling me that I'm never gonna have this again? 
 Yeah, that's exactly what I'm telling you. 
 Go, run off to a new city, but you're still gonna want your freedom because that's who you are. 
 You should seriously reconsider being a part of my wedding.

 Thank you for this, Phoebe. 
 Oh, are you kidding? 
 I love that you guys aren't seeing each other until the ceremony. 
 It's so... deliriously romantic. 
 Does my milk bath await? 
 She's been like this all morning. 
 That's enough. I just want to get married. 
 Aww. 
 Have you told Phoebe about the great apartment we found in New York? 
 I don't want to hear it. 
 I'm gonna miss you so much. 
 Phoebe, you would die. 
 It's this amazing Tribeca loft. It overlooks the Hudson. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's to die. 
 Oh, God. It's work again. 
 Somebody hasn't been back to pick up her files. 
 Honestly, I know why she's avoiding it. 
 You hate saying good-byes. 
 [laughs] 
 Well, work calls. 
 Say hi to Abby and Jo for me tonight. 
 Abby's... 
 She's got a... 
 Abby is so... she's so busy. 
 She's got a deadline. 
 She's got so much work to do. 
 Whatever. 
 Whatever. Come here. 
 I love you, okay? I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Thank you. 
 Bye. Yes, you're welcome. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Was I not supposed to say anything? 
 It's okay. 
 Sorry. 
 I'll give you a pass, but listen... no more Abby talk, okay? 
 Don't know who she is. 
 Yeah.

 Yikes. 
 It looks like "A Beautiful Mind" up in here. 
 Hey, did you get that copy I sent you? 
 I did. That's why I've been calling. 
 Oh, yeah, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you. 
 I just... All over the place, but guess who's almost done with her book. 
 Me! 
 My deadline's in two days, but just one quick revision pass and I think I can send it in. 
 And the kids are at school. 
 So, once the book is off my plate, I am all about SheShe all the time. 
 All right, well, I had some notes and thoughts. 
 Should I just email them to you? 
 Um, that would be fab. I'm just a multitasking mama. 
 And I sent you an article. 
 There's definitely a piece in it. 
 You know the whole "can a woman have it all" conundrum? 
 [groans] I hate that conundrum. 
 Well, you're not alone. 
 There's a new survey that just came out, and it says today's woman can't even think about having it all. 
 She's just worried about doing the sh1t she needs to do without losing it. 
 You know, she's worried about cracking up. 
 Answer... carbonated caffeine. [can opens] 
 Oh, yes. 
 Actually, ma'am, you've been here since we opened, and you haven't purchased anything yet. 
 Okay, well, you know what? 
 We're gonna have two coffees, one of which will be to-go. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 So I thought you might be able to relate... to the study. 
 Oh, my God, yeah. 
 And I'm sorry that I've been all over the place, but Jake comes back from Latvia tomorrow, and then he's taking the kids, and then I can finally get this off my plate, do all those changes, and I can think about the next piece. 
 All right, well, have you called Delia? 
 'Cause you all need to make up before her big day. 
 I think I'm gonna sit that one out... the wedding. 
 Sit it out? You're a bridesmaid. 
 Yes, but I, uh... I actually meant what I said, and Delia made it pretty clear that she didn't want me there, so... 
 And I make it pretty clear that I think my sister is a thirsty ho for stealing my husband, but I'd still like an apology.

 What? 
 I thought that Alex was coming in this morning. 
 Mm, nope. Change of plans. 
 [dishes clanging] 
 Is there a problem? 
 Yeah, there is, actually. 
 It's about respect. 
 I'm fed up with cleaning up after customers. 
 That's Alex's job. 
 My job is very specific. 
 I'm here for one thing and for one thing only. 
 Screw people? 
 Bake. 
 Oh. 
 You care to explain why you're acting like such a bloody clam shiner? 
 I don't know what you mean... literally. 
 Jo, you've hardly even looked at me this morning. 
 Okay. 
 I don't have time for games. 
 I'm here to do my job. 
 Part of being a professional is leaving your feelings at the door. 
 Right, 'cause that's clearly what you're doing right now.

 Awful. 
 [normal voice] The worst. 
 This is not Abby. What is going on with her? 
 I was afraid this was gonna happen. 
 I've seen this before. 
 What? 
 She gets self-destructive. She pushes people away. 
 She's bullheaded. You know that about her.

 This is the first time someone has actually made me feel smart and funny and needed, and I know JD and I have not been together for a long time, but... I feel closer to him than I've ever felt to any man. 
 So back off, both of you, because he's not going anywhere.

 "The book's in good shape, and this is an impossible amount of plates, so done." 
 That's the spirit, baby. 
 Yeah. 
 I just can't keep worrying about every little thing, you know? 
 I'm gonna give myself a heart attack. 
 [groans] 
 Honestly, I feel like I am cracking up a little bit... like the survey says. 
 Abby, I think you're a little hard on yourself. 
 And you're always asking... for more when you should be asking for help. 
 And that is a very unhelpful defense mechanism. 
 And I think you... are especially hard on yourself when you think something is your fault. 
 Oh. Uh-huh. 
 No. 
 No. No, no, no Delia talk right now. 
 This is not a good time. 
 Abby, I know you're probably blaming yourself. 
 Well, it's my fault. [chuckles] 
 I just don't have the bandwidth to deal with it at the moment. 
 Will you tomorrow, when you wake up and you realize that you skipped out on your friend's wedding? 
 I didn't skip out. I was uninvited. 
 Mm. That sounds like an excuse to me. 
 Okay, uh, this has been a very productive rescue mission. 
 Clearly I'm not dead, so... 
 Great. Just skip it. Skip the wedding. 
 I mean, this will all blow over, and in a few years, you'll probably forget there was ever a fight. 
 But I know you, and you will always regret not being there for a friend.

 And that is horrible on more levels than I can probably count or... comprehend.

 I really do, and what I said... it came out wrong.

 I'm so sorry. 
 Delia, I am so sorry.

 You're not even the one getting married. 
 God, stop worrying about me. 
 Why can't I, huh? I don't mind. 
 Because I'm your boss. Remember? 
 Back when things were normal. 
 I don't want to go back to normal. 
 Ay, Dios. Make up your mind. 
 Look, I only agreed for things going back to the way they were because I am a terrific coward. 
 I don't actually want that. 
 Besides, I don't think it can happen. 
 So I'll hire someone to manage you instead of me... a great, big, non-seduceable dude with no homosexual leanings. 
 Listen, will you just... I am trying to... 
 God, woman, you are difficult. 
 You just lock your jaws and won't let go. 
 And I'm helpless... every time. 
 I am completely helpless against you, Jo. 
 The way we fight... God, it's exhausting and hot and exhilarating and, frankly, weird, but you know what? 
 I cannot imagine sparring with anyone else ever. 
 Well, I'm sure there are plenty of ladies out there for you to sword-fight. 
 No, no, no. 
 See, now I believe that all of those were just replacements for you, Josephine. 
 They... those women, they were just one off and good-bye, but you, I... 
 I can't stop thinking about you. 
 I wake up, and I cannot stop imagining how we might be together. 
 I am... God help me... 
 I am in love with you.

 You and Albert. 
 You looked like you were having fun. 
 It wasn't fun. It was ugly and desperate. 
 It was. I know it was. I saw that. 
 What I didn't know was that my future wife was so ugly and desperate.

 Gordon, this whole time all I've wanted is you! 
 No, it looks like you wanted your boss! 
 No, I didn't! I didn't! 
 I told myself I never wanted to get married, and you and this big wedding and your big life... 
 I just felt like it was swallowing me whole. 
 Oh, so you spread your legs?

 Not the part of me that loves you, just the ugly, desperate part. 
 I'm so disgusted with myself. 
 You should be.

 No. 
 In front of my friends, my family? 
 Right, my friends. 
 My family! 
 Because you don't have either. 
 I should've been paying attention to that.

 I don't want to hear your tears. Don't cry. 
 That doesn't help anything. 
 Crying isn't gonna get us out of this. 
 Jesus.

 I got nothing. I can't come up with anything. 
 The only thing I can think of is going out and telling everybody that the wedding is off because the bride is a whore.
