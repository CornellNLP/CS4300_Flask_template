 Previously on Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce... 
 There is no book tour. 
 Barnes & Noble can't sell a book the author doesn't believe in. 
 I think we should take the place across from the grove. 
 The kids will love that. 
 It's $4,500 a month... 
 I know. 
 And between that and the mortgage... 
 I know. 
 My divorce attorney is actually great. 
 Don't tell her to call Delia. 
 Mediators are jackals. 
 They prey on the idea of "a good divorce." 
 You know, if I finally got to kiss you now, I would be the only one that would have to be guilty. 
 Nate, you are married,  and that makes me guilty. 
 This card was declined too. 
 You play to hurt, and not just me, Spencer and Eric too. 
 I'm gonna sue for full custody. 
 What? 
 What's that? 
 Dad gave it to me. 
 He says one day I might even be able to meet her. 
 It's Jake's Becca. 
 That is Becca. 
 I think the kids are gonna love staying at the Paradiso. 
 Jake told me he signed the lease today. 
 I was gonna tell you as soon as I came home. 
 I just want you out today, and I suggest you hire a lawyer, because I have. 
 I already have.

 ♪ So why is life ♪ 
 Oh, [Bleep]... Ugar. 
 Sugar. 
 [Door slams] 
 Hey. 
 Dad! 
 Mommy just said [Bleep]. 
 Really? 
 No, I did not. 
 I said "sugar" because of the window that you said you would fix. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Lilly, dad's here. 
 Are we going to your new place now? 
 No, we're going to school now, and then tonight, that is when the adventure begins. 
 Did you get the Xbox hooked up? 
 Did I get the Xbox hooked up? 
 Does Superman fly? 
 Does Spider-man do spider-man-y things? 
 Okay. 
 Yes. 
 Hey, superhero, seriously, the window. 
 It almost took my finger off. 
 You said you'd fix it. 
 I've been a little busy, you know, moving. 
 Can we get Lilly please? 
 [Knock at door] Dad's here. 
 Just tell me why. 
 Why what? 
 Why your divorce has to ruin my life. 
 ♪ [Vocalizing] ♪ 
 Hey. Good morning, Sunshine. 
 She wanted to go to a kickback today with some friends. 
 A kick-what? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay, well, she can do that any night of the week, but tonight, she's gonna be having fun. 
 She's gonna be having so much fun that you guys'll wish you had less fun, right? 
 Right. 
 Okay. Go find your sister. 
 So what are you doing tonight that's so much fun? 
 Hookers and blow, obviously. 
 Obviously. 
 Becca Riley's not coming over, if that's what you're asking. 
 I... well, you know, we just had an agreement, and... 
 Yes, I know the rules. 
 Don't try to buy the kids' affections. 
 Don't trash the other person. 
 No meeting significant others till they're actually significant. 
 I got it. 
 And what about the window? 
 Yeah, you should fix that before you lose a finger. 
 Oh, my God, I just found a finger. 
 [Rock music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What a dick move. 
 Yeah. 
 Just fix the damn window. 
 Now, having said that, let me speak to the advantages of power tools. 
 Don't say anything. Okay. 
 Go to home. 
 Thank you. 
 Get a drill. Use it. 
 It won't make you a lesbian, and if it did, so much the better. 
 She is definitely not a lesbian. 
 We have covered that. 
 Shh. Shh. 
 Shh. Shh. 
 Well, I'm just glad that Jake has finally moved out of the house. 
 I don't have to deal with his snotty little side glances and listen to him chewing his little kashi cereal like a farm animal. 
 Or the sweet smell of man-gas in the morning. 
 That's my favorite. 
 Or the sound of breathing. 
 Just general breathing. 
 [Laughs] 
 He's gone. 
 I'm free. 
 So what about Nate? Married Nate? 
 Is he still trying to get with you? 
 I think I sufficiently scared him off. 
 Here's something. 
 This afternoon, I shall be dazzling potential client Barry Juck. 
 Wait. Juck... producer Juck? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Might have had s*x with him in the photo booth at the Soho. 
 Terrible movies. Terrible. 
 God, his movies are awful. 
 What is it, Monster Mash? 
 Actually, Master Monster Six is coming out. 
 Master Monster. 
 Horrible. Oh, my God. And then, tears of joy, story time. What? Are you volunteering at school? That's... that is a first. Dan is going for primary custody, so I need to put in some serious face time with the kids, and I'm gonna like it, damn it. [Laughs] Maybe you will like it. Have we met? Lyla Straley. No, I like my kids, but I think that might be a genetic trick. The rest are vermin. No offense. None taken. [Mug clatters] So check it out. Thank you. You're welcome. Holy high tit job. Danna Brooks grew a pair. Dr. Marber. You say that name one more time, and honestly, knuckle supper. I know. No, I can't. I can't have it. So high. I'm just saying. I can't have it. I'm just saying. What are you doing when they're that high? Where is Max, by the way? I don't know. I'm texting him now. "Max, where are you?" Wait, wait, so what did you end up going with? Oh, uh, I went Star Wars comforter but spider-man sheets. I like it. Yeah. Charlie gets to sleep in the perfect movie  he'll never see, Spider-Wars. The cable is hooked up. I got the WI-FI hooked up. I got the Xbox hooked up. I got power bars for Lilly. And I got the waffle maker for Charlie. Oh, panic buy. You know what? They got all that stuff at home... At Abby's, okay? I want there to be some touchstones, you know? The comforts of home. You make me want to puke! Jesus, what the hell is that? Are you serious? I just can't stand you. Acting class. It's a little noisy during the day, quiets down around midnight. Nick, 36. Oh, hey, Jake, 31. How you doing? This is Max. Hey. Pleasure. Hey, you two ever looking to score any coke, Cialis, or whatnot, I'm your guy. [Chuckles] Thanks. Hoo-ah! I can't stand here looking at you! He seems lovely. Yeah. Yeah. [Phone jingling] Oh. Oh, crap. Oh. It's Abby. I told her that I would meet her for coffee after drop-off. I think I said "might." "Might." Just "might be there." Answer it, dude. I don't want to lie to her. Then don't answer it. I-I can't ignore her. Dude, you know what? Just stop being a pussy and tell her the truth. We're friends, and you're not gonna pick sides just 'cause she's your sister. She'll understand that. Right, what am I talking about? Okay, continue to be a pussy until we figure it out, okay? Do you want us to come over later? First night without the kids can be a little bit weird. Oh. Or a little devastating. Could be a little devastating. No, I'm actually looking forward to a little bit of me time. Are you? Yeah. What does that entail? That means I'm gonna go to my book editor, Melissa, and toss around some book ideas, and go home, soak in the tub, drink a glass of wine, get back on the writing horse. If things go south, I will call you, I promise. Love you, Abby. I love you guys. Keep your phone charged. Yup, I know. Whitney. What's going on? Where is everybody? I was just about to call you. They... they moved the Juck meeting to 2:00. They? Who they? Who they? Delia. I told her you weren't available until after 3:00. No, it's okay. It's okay. Okay. Hey. I'll see you there. All right, bye-bye. As you know, associates don't reschedule meetings without clearance from all the partners. True, but Whales Trump Partners. Juck needed to move the meeting. Did he? Mm-hmm. To the one time I had to be at my children's school? I know, it is a shame. But your kids come first. I get that. Mm-hmm. [Knock at door] Lyla, can you believe this woman? Our fabulous rainmaker. I mean, come on, Barry Freaking Juck here. [Laughs] 2 million in billables for Loeb & Loeb last year, and he is primed to jump ship because I got him sole custody of his dog in his divorce. Great work, Delia. Thank you. Partnership is but a stone's throw away for this lady, right, Lyla? Women supporting women, that's what it's all about. You bet. Hillary 2016. Have fun at school. [Inhales tensely] Mm. Hi, it's me. I am terribly sorry, but I need a huge favor. Okay, one, Girlfriends' Guide To The Terrible Teens. Two, Girlfriends' Guide... [Phone jingles] To Working Out While Working It. Three,  Girlfriends' Guide To Working Moms Working It Out,  but that one's not as catchy. Is... hello? Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. Just... just go on. Go on. Okay, so I have this whole weekend carved out. I just need to figure out which titles you want me to focus on. Abby, can I... can I be honest here? Yeah. It's not about the titles. Your book sales are way down. "Way down." What does that mean? On Amazon, you're selling just below Why Cats Paint. You've lost your street cred in the mommy wars. I'm sorry, but we think the Girlfriends' Guide franchise is dead. Dead? Uh, Jesus. [Chuckles] Well, this isn't exactly the meeting that I was expecting to have, Melissa. Missy. Missy. I am the sole breadwinner in my house. There's no other source of income, so I need to figure out something. Well, the team here has a very exciting idea for you. Okay.

Oh, your mouth is saying "wait," but it is feeling very "go" down here. I know. I know. I got to... okay. I got to unpack before I pick up the kids. Come on. I'm just so anxious. I mean, Abby has home court advantage, literally. The kids grew up there. I want them to... I want them to want to be here too. Of course you do. [Sighs] I could bring over some fonuts later. We could play charades or something. Too soon? Just thought I'd offer. I totally get it. Thank you for understanding. I do have something for the anxiety though. Yeah, yeah, I can't take pills. They make me feel like I know how to dance. I had a bad prom experience. [Both laugh] I'm talking about a more holistic approach, redirecting that nervous energy. Mmm.

You were pretty intense there. Well, why should Clooney win, right? [Laughter] Anyway, forgive my lateness. We are all so excited that you're here. So maybe we should start. Absolutely. Great. Let's. Absolutely. Have a seat. What happened to story time? Your bull[Bleep] was enough fiction for me, and I took care of it. Ladies, hello? Yes. Hi. [Children chatting] Spencer's mom, Ms. Straley, sent me to read to the children. I'm sorry, but story time is supposed to be a chance for the parent to interact with the class. Mama.

I'm gonna go play Xbox. Or if you wanted to go out, Charlie, I was thinking we could go bowling, or we could play Monopoly. Lame. [Program beeping flatly] Dad, I can't log in. Okay.

If the house is on fire, you'll never forgive yourself. Bitch. It's Jake. That's wonderful. Call him in the morning. Well, he's having a rough time with the kids. His first night at the new place. And he wants you to come over? No. Max, my love, you need to stay out of this. She's your sister. [Stammering] But he was my friend first. Am I just supposed to pretend that relationship didn't exist? No, of course not, but look, right now everyone is really raw. Nothing good can come from getting involved in this, not for Jake, not for your sister, and not for you. You're right. You're right. Of course I'm right.

I do too. Great. Hey, hey, sorry it took so long to get back to you. Have The Animals eaten the zookeeper? Uh, no, I got it under control. That's great. How'd you pull that off? [Pins clatter] Oh! So close! I'll take it. Jake, what's all that noise in the background? Dad, it's your turn. Okay, I'll be right there. Max, I did a bad thing. Charlie and Lilly are bowling with Becca Riley. Jake, that's nuclear. You... I got to go. Really? Sneaking phone calls? A little juvenile, don't you think? Only a little. You finished now? Yes. Jake's got it under control. They're bowling with Becca Riley. Becca Riley? Yeah. You know Blood Sisters is my favorite show. So? Oh, my God. You incredible hypocrite. You... This vodka's not working. Hoping for redemption yet careening down a shame spiral? Yes. It'll work. You just have to drink through it. My ex-husband's girlfriend is plastered on my daughter's wall. My brand is dead.

You have to. Please. I know. I know. I realize it's a lot to ask at this late hour, believe me. I don't want to be asking it, but it's not for me. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Think of the bonds of friendship. Hey, stop, stop, stop. Obviously, generally speaking, we don't have a bond. You are incredible. We don't have a bond. Delia. Hi, can you make it happen? Really? [Muffled] Really? Oh, my God, you are our knight in shining Armani. We love you. Thank you. Bye. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She's so great. She's going to meet us with the poster in 20 minutes. How does she do that? 20 minutes. How does she do it? I don't know. Thank you so much. Oh. I love you. Why are you thanking her? Can you believe this? I want... I would have killed for a night alone in my house when I was married, and now that I get it, I fell apart. Of course. Oh, my God. Because it's a different kind of alone. Now you're alone alone. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Did it? No. No. I think it was, like, eight months into my divorce that I realized maybe I'm not incredibly horny. Maybe I just sleep with these people on my free nights because I want the company. That's so crazy, right? Yeah. No, you're incredibly horny, honey. I know I am. I am incredibly horny. Yeah. I'm horny right now. [Sighs] Morning, ladies. Hi. Hi. Mwah. Hi, gorgeous. Both : Mwah. Oh, Lyla. You've got a thousand bucks worth of cocaine on your chest, or you're getting it on with Mr. Donut. [Laughs] Delia, thank you so much for interrupting what was probably an awesome evening. No problem. Prince showed up at Downey's party, and you know, I love the little guy, but he just takes over. So ready to go. I have something for you. Is this what you were looking for? Oh, my God, yes. Oh, my God, thank you so much. Mwah. Thank... you have no idea. Thank you so much. Never let it be said I do not go the extra mile for a client... Or a friend. [Groans] Is it in English? Thank you, Delia. Ah. And so the great poster-capade comes to a close. Call us if you need anything, all right? Bye. Bye. Come here. You are a great mom. It's all gonna be okay. Yup. Thank you. I know. Okay. Bye. Bye. [Bleep]. Oh, what is it? How is this all gonna be okay? [Horn honks] [Car door clicks] Hi. Hi, mom. Oh, hey, hi. Did you have fun? You were right, mom. Dad's place was super fun. I bet it was. Seriously, Jake? Look, it's a long story. It shouldn't be a story. You said you would tell me before something like this happened. Well, the kids had a great time, and Lilly was in heaven. Oh, I bet she was. She and Becca are in the same peer group. We had a deal: No others until they're significant. Maybe she is. Did it ever occur to you that maybe Becca is significant to me? Oh. Oh. Mom! Look, we did have an agreement, and I'm sorry. Where'd you get this cool lightsaber? That's not a lightsaber. That's mommy's toy. I thought we weren't gonna introduce the kids to significant others. I'll just go. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be great. Mom? Yeah? What's up? Do we have photo paper? Yeah, in the office. Why? Look at this great shot. I'm gonna print it and hang it over my bed. What about the poster? Posters are whatever. This shows she's my actual friend. Really? My Instagram blew up last night. It was amazing, mom. And I got invited to Xander Price's house next weekend. So you're just gonna trade on Becca Riley's fame so that you can be popular? What? I'm just saying you don't want people to be friends with you for the wrong reasons. You're just jealous 'cause she's so pretty and young. Wow. Hold on, there. Dad found someone awesome. You know why? 'Cause he's awesome. So it's too bad you kicked him out, huh? But it's not my fault that you're alone and you can't handle it. I can't believe you did karaoke with Becca Riley. She's so nice. That's so awesome. Trust me, some day Lilly is gonna be like, "ew. Oh, my dad was ancient when he was going out with Becca Riley." I really screwed up with her, Max. Wait, you're not gonna yell at me and tell me what a crappy brother I am? I totally snapped on her about the whole Becca Riley thing. You know, her being so excited? And it's not her fault. She's a teenager. It's just Jake's moving on, and I need to learn how to deal with it. Abs, give yourself a break. It just really hurt that all of you were out, you know? My kids, my brother, all having fun without me. Abs, I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate here, and no one sent me a map. I know you and Jake go way back, and you're allowed to have that. I just need to feel like I have first dibs. Abby... always. It's a deal. Deal? Deal. Don't worry about Becca with the kids, 'cause she is great. No, no, no. Yeah, right. Wow, too soon. Yup. Okay. I can't believe Jake wouldn't fix the window. Right? What a douche? So much better. Uh. Hi, Abby. Hi. Brutus. [Laughs] Address these things... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Lyla, have a seat. Dan? Is everything okay? [Clears throat] Am I in trouble? If it is about our luxury bag, I know, and we've been working on getting him to give it up and have one that is more "locker-friendly." Lyla, it's been brought to my attention that you sent your nanny to story time. Yes. Unavoidable work complication. It takes a village, right? The rules in the school handbook are very clear. Parent volunteers may not send a proxy. Juanita's a very gifted storyteller. I'm sure she is. That's not really the point. It sends a message to the children that they're not your priority. Excuse me? Would an apology help here? I understand that divorce can be a trying time, so an apology... No, no, no, no. By all means, I apologize. I apologize for having a job. I'm sorry I make a substantial income to pay for your green-grocer, small-batch, locally-sourced, farm-to-table, epically-butchered... Lyla. Hormone-free, gluten-intolerant bills. Lyla. But here's the thing. I don't work, my kids don't go to school. So if you want to call and tell me tuition is free, I be happy to be here to story time. and arbor day and kid's court and snack bar and talent night and the nose-picking Olympics and every other bull[Bleep] holiday that costs me a fortune. But if you're not gonna tell me it's free, I've got to work, 'cause I'm a working mother with a boatload of mouths to feed. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss pertaining to my children? Don't call me in here again. [Phone ringing] Damn it. Yes? I know, I know, I know. Please tell the Disney people that I'm about to... I'm running late. My morning meeting went long. Thank you. [Drill whirring] [Imitating explosions] [Window bangs] [Gasps]
