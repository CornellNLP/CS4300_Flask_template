We got hit, and he got out. He's out there? Shh! No one can know this, okay? Why? Because they can't, all right? And don't say anything about the car either, because I got to... I got to get it fixed, and I don't even know how I'm gonna do that. Frank, Frank, Frank, you're freaking me out, okay? What... what were you gonna do? Come on, Jules, don't... don't make me say it. Were you gonna kill him? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jules, you don't understand... Oh, my God, you can't... I don't have a choice right now, I swear to God, if I did... You don't?

Okay, then. Uh, how's the rest of your day going? You didn't have to do that, get your dad involved. That was all him. He saw you on the news.

Patty, I didn't take that money. That's ridiculous. Well, of course it is. I know you didn't. And I told the pastor that, but... but he's gonna call the police in the morning. He said he wants them to search your house. [exhales sharply] I must apologize. Where are my manners? Please come in. Oh, no, no. That's not necessary. I insist, Patty. I...

Get down on the ground, you son of a bitch. Raimy. It's him, Satch. He's the Nightingale. Check his house. There's a body, his wife's body. It's hidden in the closet upstairs. ♪ ♪ [sighs] ♪ ♪ Look at the smudges on it. How am I supposed to read it? Here. Hey, Frank. Frank, Frank. Hold up a second, man.

Bonehead stole money from the same church the mayor goes to. Can you believe that? Huh. You got enough to arrest him? Not yet. The big man's putting pressure. Wants us to keep him in custody while we make the case. ♪ ♪ Well, at least I'm not wanted for murder anymore, right? That's one small victory for the space-time continuum or whatever the hell this is. His wife's body isn't in the closet anymore. You sure? We searched it this afternoon. Trust me, I looked like a crazy person. Except to the Deacon. He knows I know. Okay, so, uh... so what do you think made him move it? ♪ ♪ You, probably. When you stole that money to set up his disappearance. He couldn't have the body there with the police sniffing around. And with no body, there was no pounding when I showed up looking for Meghan,  and there was no reason for me to break in and confront him. That's the moment when everything changed on my end. Without that body, there was no manhunt for the Deacon. He never changed his appearance or bought that burner phone. And without that phone, Meghan never called the hotline from the cabin,  which means there was no police presence there,  which means... I never killed him. So even though everything changed, it's possible he still has Meghan up in the cabin. And if he does, he's probably thinking she's the reason I knew about his wife's body in the closet. Which means she could be in the same trouble as before. ♪ ♪ [knock at door] Come on in. Hey, Jules. Hey. How you been? Good. Frank around? No, not yet. He's coming home for a quick dinner soon.

No. You mind if I take a look in your garage? What's going on, Satch? Why are you here? I just want to take a look in the garage. You know, you were his best friend. The only person he ever really trusted. Jules. And first, you stab him in the back to protect Stan Moreno. And now you're here, snooping around like he's got something to hide. Come on. He deserves more. Garage is unlocked. Go ahead and take a look if you want. [exhales] What's going on? Just talking with Jules, catching up. Yeah, about what? He wants to have a look in the garage.

And something just doesn't smell right here. Oh, my God. Why you digging into this, Satch? Is this another thing for Stan? Stan has nothing to do with this. I'm coming at this on your side. Oh, really? Yeah, I see that look in your eye. You're into something, and I'm worried that you're trying to take it too far. Please. Spare me your concern, okay?

And the woman's baby was fine,  and that kid... Stan saved his life. But Frank, you and me, we're like brothers. But Stan, I owed him big, and I had to pay up. I just hate that it was you that had to take the hit. The crazy thing is, to this day, I still regret it. The guy had it coming. Yeah, maybe. But it doesn't matter. It still sticks with you.
