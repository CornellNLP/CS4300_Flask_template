 My name is Detective Raimy Sullivan. 
 My father was killed in 1996. 
 Last night... 
 [electricity crackling] 
 [indistinct radio chatter] 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 I spoke to him. 
 Your father? 
 Dad? 
 So you're telling me that in 20 years, I'm gonna be on the job with my daughter? 
 No. You die tomorrow. 
 [gunshot] 
 [tires screeching] 
 [gasps] 
 Dad survived. But saving his life changed everything. 
 We've ID'd the remains from the marsh. 
 I'm sorry, Raimy, it's your mom. 
 The most wanted serial killer in New York took my mom. 
 Now, whatever we do, however we try to fix things, history keeps changing. Your name is Daniel Lawrence. How do you know my name? I'm your girlfriend! I've never been to Queens. And I don't know you. I'm sorry. All I want is to get back what I lost. Previously on "Frequency"... Detective Raimy Sullivan, 21st. Why are you looking at me like that? Sullivan. Naw, it's okay you didn't call me back. I worked a case with a detective today. Had zero recollection we hooked up before. I have a date tonight. You're dating? Yeah, we're separated, Frank. For what, two weeks? We both know it's been a whole lot longer than that. You asked me if I believe in fate. Yeah, fate, kismet, whatever you want to call it. I guess I never really had a reason to before. We got the Hideaway Mountain Camp. Larissa was only a nurse at that camp. Which means the Nightingale passed through that camp. What you got? Everything. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ This is a significant breakthrough in the hunt for this killer. So if anyone attended, knows someone who attended or worked at the Hideaway Mountain Camp, please call us at this tip line. 212-851-3122. I want to speak directly to the families of the victims. I'm a detective, but I am also one of you. My mother was... And my father died before he could catch her killer. We are still witnessing... ♪ ♪ We want to thank you all for coming out. That's gonna conclude this press conference. If anyone has any questions, you know our number. You can contact us here at the precinct. [radio static] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] What you got? Damn. [sighs] ♪ ♪ How many? I don't know. Ten, 15 more, maybe. All asking to speak with you, directly. What can I say? The crazies love me. That's very funny. You know, I got to say, I'm not too happy with you being in the middle of all of this. I've been in the middle of this since I was eight years old. I'll be fine. Hey, we got DNA confirmation. Larissa Abbot was the girl that he held up at the camp in '94 after it closed. ME thinks she was killed maybe late '94, 95. So she was the Nightingale's first kill. But why her? Exactly. Oh, and I spoke to her brother, Jesse, again. Wanted to see if he had any of her old things that we could look through. And? Says he threw it away awhile back. Yeah? Yeah. ♪ ♪ When? 2001? Her family threw most of it away after her remains were found. But you could go to her house. You could search her room while it's all still there. And tell 'em what? What're you talking about? They don't even know she's dead, Raimes. Now you're telling me she's not gonna be found for another five years? That's five years of hell for these people. I know. And I get it. But you can't say anything. How can I not? Because it's safer if we work these leads in 2016. Nothing changes that way. If I can find this guy today, he'll never see you coming in '96. So they suffer? Right now, you having this information is more valuable than her family having it. I promise. And I know how that sounds, I do. But I also know I'm right. Okay, so... what exactly am I looking for? Anything camp-related. Any place she may have hidden something. Closet, bed, desk. Hope chest. Hope chest? Trust me. Really, you realize the ammunition you're giving me, right? If your mom ever does let me back into the house, I'm gonna have some serious digging to do. How are things with you two? [sighs] Giving her space. Okay. Do you think maybe you should try talking to her? Tell her what you told me about how the job got the better of you? Listen, Raimes, I appreciate the help, but just... why don't you just let your parents be the parents, all right? I got to handle it. [knocking] Hey, I got to go. Talk later. Come in. 'Sup? What's up? Roommate not home? Look, you don't got to worry about Miracella anymore, all right? But you do. Stan put a warning card out on her. Really? He's playing this one cards up? Meaning what? Meaning he preferred to do her like he did Little Jay. Dead in a car, two to the skull. Tell me I'm wrong. I don't know the particulars. You don't want to know the particulars. Look, but I do know you can't be going around saying stuff like that. Why are you protecting him, Satch? Huh? You know what he is. Really? Yeah! Dumbass, really? I'm protecting you. ♪ ♪ I appreciate that. ♪ ♪ Yeah, well, don't mention it. ♪ ♪ All right, girls, party's over. Bye, Michelle. Hi, Mom. Hey, Mookie Wilson. How was practice? Good. Good. Hit 'em hard? Thanks, Coach. Put your stuff away. Thank you again. I tried to get off early, but it was... it was nuts. Of course. I'm happy to help. See you soon. [chuckles] Um, you know... I had a great time the other day. Yeah, uh... me too, it was... it was fun. Maybe we can do it again. I'm pretty open next week. Yeah. Yeah, we should. Um... sounds good. All right. [chuckles] It's a date. Yeah. Mm. Oh, was that... No, no, no it's... My bad. ♪ ♪ I'll see you soon. Yeah, okay, sure. ♪ ♪ So I ran all the names from the camp files. Campers, counselors, staff. Anything? [chuckles] Not really, we got eight DUIs, some pet p theft, a little trespassing. But no one we should keep on our radar. So we have nothing? No, not quite. See, I just got a call. Apparently, there was some youth group that was associated with the camp. They bussed in juvenile delinquents from rough neighborhoods every summer for two weeks. St. Abigail's Angels. That's promising, right? Well, the guy who ran it, he works here in the city and I got him coming in now. Hey. You think the two of them ever had a chance? ♪ ♪ What got you thinking in on that? Well, you know, if I had to bet and go all in on one couple, it would've been them. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] Do you know where my daughter is? Do you know where Larissa is? Mom, I already told you, they said they don't have any new information. Ma'am, my name is Detective Frank Sullivan. I'm with the NYPD. NYPD? What're you doing all the way up here? We're looking into a case that, uh, may or may not be related to Larissa's disappearance. What case? Ma'am, I'm really not at liberty to say. Uh, it's an ongoing investigation. Is it that serial killer? The Nightingale? That's his name, right? I keep hearing about him on the news. Tell me that animal did not take my daughter. Mrs. Abbott, I... Please, if you know anything. I just need to know that she's okay. We're doing everything that we can. Okay? I promise you. But I'm gonna need some help from you. Can you do that? ♪ ♪ [tense music] ♪ ♪ Take as long as you need. ♪ ♪ [music box chiming] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ So how long has St. Abigail's Angels been around? Well, I started it up in the late '80s. At St. Abigail's Church in Manhattan. I'm a deacon there. We cater to at-risk kids in the neighborhood, try to keep them off the streets as best we can. You know, volunteer work, sports, field trips, stuff like that. That include the camp? I, uh... I worked for the folks who ran Hideaway back in the '80s. Real nice people. One year, I asked them if they were open to hosting the kids a couple weeks out of the summer, and they were all for it. And that's why it kills me to think the Nightingale had anything to do with this place. Any of your Angels ever act out while they were up there? Listen, these kids have been dealde a pretty crappy hand in life. But at the end of the day, they're good kids. We're just running down every possibility. No, I get it. You need to turn over every stone. Well, I'd be lying to you if I said some of them weren't in rougher shape than others. That's why I called. Well, we were hoping that the church could provide us with paperwork on all these kids. From the early '90s? Yeah. Yeah, I can have a look. We appreciate that. Thanks. You're welcome. [dark music] This is the, uh, third time in two years you've tried to hurt yourself. You want to talk about why you're back in here? ♪ ♪ You know, we can't help you unless you decide to help yourself. You people can't help me. You'll only make it worse. You always do. What makes you say that? ♪ ♪ I need to go. Now. No, you know you can't do that. You're here for another 36 hours, so why don't we just... Then I need my cell phone back. Need to make a call? I can do that. But, uh, I'll need to supervise, okay? [dial tone drones] ♪ ♪ Never mind. [Hootie and the Blowfish's "I Only Wanna Be With You" playing] ♪ ♪ Raim? ♪ ♪ Raimy! Hey. What? I thought I told you to put your clothes away? And I did. Really? Then why am I still looking at them? It's my room. What difference does it make? Hey, excuse me. I'm not asking a lot here. I just want you to put the clothes away. I have homework. I'll put them away later. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Did you talk to Mom? Mom? No, why? What's... something wrong? No. So what'd you find?  I found diaries. All the way from, uh, '85 to when she was taken in '94. Um, I'll start there and work my way back. She wrote a lot about a hometown boyfriend. Mateo Rivera, right? Yeah. Yeah, I read about him in the police report. Word was, he beat her, but they could never make a case. He had an alibi. Yeah, well, so did O.J. There's some messed up stuff in here about Mateo. And she tore out some pages, so...  if she left this in, I want to see what she took out. I'm gonna head up there and see what I can find out. Any camp stuff in her room?
