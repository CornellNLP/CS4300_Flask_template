 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yup, right here. 
 Yup, yup, copy. 
 We'll be ready. 
 Okay, trauma is a minute out, including a uniformed CPD officer. 
 I need rooms, people. Rooms, stat. 
 Treatment 3, talk to me. Wrapped up the frostbite. 
 Just waiting on a discharge order. 
 Okay, Dr. Choi? 
 Got it. 
 But first, guy got spooked in the ladies room. 
 Gotta get the skin out of his zipper. 
 All right, people. 
 I got a waiting room full of snot, and I have traumas en rout No room for coddling, people. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
 Incoming! 
 You're going to Trauma 1. 
 18 year-old male, GCS 12, tachy's to 130. 
 Suspected DUI, parked his Beemer in someone's living room, broke the gas line, started a fire. 
 Okay. Dr. Rhodes, you got this? 
 Got it. 
 Thank you. 
 X-ray! 
 Talk to me. 
 GCS 6, BP 12O over 80, King airway in the field. 
 All right, Dr. Choi, Dr. Reese, now. 
 You're going to Trauma 2. 
 He's hypoxic. Inhaled a lot of smoke. 
 All right, rotate. 
 I pulled the driver, the kid, from the wreckage. 
 Yeah. 
 My partner insisted on clearing the house. 
 Draw trauma labs, an ABG, and a carboxyhemoglobin. 
 On my count. 
 Thank you, Officer. 
 One, two, three. 
 I'll take over. 
 Let's start a saline line. 
 Let's get him set up. 
 Tough to bag him. 
 He's pretty spasmed down. I need suction. 
 20 of Etomidate and 100 of succs now. 
 We need a better airway. 
 On it, prepping succs. 
 Watch his BP. Heartrate's still tachy. 
 Bilateral pubic rami fractures on the X-ray. 
 Let's FAST him. 
 Pressure's dropping. 
 There's free fluid in his belly. 
 Possible pelvic hematoma. 
 All right, let's get him up to the OR now. 
 Start two units of rapid transfuser. 
 Put trauma and angio on standby. 
 Mmhmm. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh, hold on. 
 He's not going anywhere till I get a DUI blood draw. 
 We're charging him. 
 His belly is shredded. 
 If I don't operate right now, you're not gonna have anybody to charge...  Whoa. 
 You already have him on IV fluids. 
 I got ten minutes, at best, to get an accurate blood-alcohol level. 
 You take him to the OR, it'll be too late. 
 The officer wants to do a draw to test your blood-alcohol content. 
 Do I have your consent? 
 No. 
 There's your answer. 
 State law says I don't need consent. 
 Go. 
 Hospital policy says you do. 
 You need to stop... 
 Move, move. Hey, uh-uh. 
 My partner could've died back there. 
 You step aside. 
 This is a hospital. 
 Our priority is to treat patients, not to make arrests. 
 As soon as he's out of surgery and awake, he's all yours. 
 Get me that blood, or you're under arrest. 
 On what charge? 
 Obstructing a police investigation. 
 You're being ridiculous. 
 Get me that blood. 
 Do what you have to do. 
 Maggie, Maggie... 
 Take the phone. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Stay back. 
 I don't know. 
 In the moment he seemed conflicted. 
 Conflicted about whether his wife should live or die? 
 He wanted you to ignore her DNR, didn't he? 
 It was complicated. 
 Everything happened so fast. 
 Dr. Halstead, we've been over this. 
 If you say that at your deposition, Jennifer Baker's attorneys are gonna have your job and your medical license. 
 But that is not what happened. 
 Look, it is my job is to protect this hospital, and we have a strong case. 
 Now, Jennifer Baker is enrolled in a promising drug trial. 
 That is not the behavior of a woman who's ready to die. 
 And in order to win this case, we need to point that out. 
 Peter, we need an approach that can both maintain Dr. Halstead's integrity and help our case. 
 Okay, look, if Sal Baker was as conflicted as you've said, might one infer that at least a part of him wanted his wife to live? 
 Yes. 
 [phone ringing] 
 Just wait. 
 Goodwin. 
 I'm on my way. 
 Yes, thank you. 
 I just got off the phone with the 21st District. 
 They're stonewalling. 
 They're still holding her? 
 I can't believe that. That's outrageous. 
 Yeah, I'm going down there. 
 April, tag in for Maggie. 
 Get my waiting room cleared. 
 Me? I got... 
 I paged the on-call. 
 She woke up this morning with the same flu as all those people in the waiting area. Don't worry. 
 You got this. 
 Okay. 
 Let me grab a coat and come with. 
 We all know what happens when you back a wild animal into a corner. 
 Maggie needs a friend, not a shrink. 
 I wasn't talking about Maggie. 
 Well, I'm fine. 
 I'm just going to have a little conversation with Voight, see if there's anything he can do. 
 By the way, you need to change your shirt. 
 Coffee stain. And where's your tie? 
 Hmm, I must've got dressed in a hurry. 
 Good luck. 
 Let's see. 43-year-old migraine patient, Treatment 1. Dr. Choi? 
 Copy that. 
 All right, uh... 
 Reese, Treatment 3, guy got clipped by a car while crossing the street. 
 Aye, captain. 
 Help! My baby! 
 Somebody help! 
 Got it. 
 [baby crying] 
 She's been fussy and crying all morning, but every time I try to put her down for a nap, she just...  she just wails. 
 I'm telling you, something's really wrong. 
 Her color's good. 
 She's responding to external stimuli. 
 Who's your pediatrician? 
 Um, uh, uh, Dr. Simon at Advocate South. 
 All right, April, let's get those records sent over. 
 Copy. 
 It's okay. 
 All right, her ears are fine. 
 Looks like retinal hemorrhages. 
 Could she have hit her head on something? 
 No, I don't...  I don't think so. 
 All right, let's order a babygram and head CT. 
 I'll let them know you're on the way. 
 Don't worry, I'm going to take really good care of your baby, all right? 
 Okay. 
 Don't worry. April? 
 [baby cries] 
 You think I look bad? You should've seen the car. 
 Ah. 
 [both chuckling] 
 Let's take a look at that leg. 
 I was rushing to my 11:00. 
 On my cell phone, which I know is a horrible idea. 
 Didn't even look before crossing the street. 
 I mean, it's totally my bad. 
 But still, whatever happened to pedestrians having the right of way? 
 Mm, that's why I take the bus. 
 Does it hurt when I press here? 
 No, not much. 
 You don't get extra points for tolerating pain, Mr. Dietrich. 
 It's not bad. It just clipped me as I was jumping out of the way, really. 
 Well, good news is, it doesn't appear to be broken. 
 But there is fluid on your knee. 
 I think we should have ortho take a look. 
 Is that really necessary? 
 I've got to file an emergency motion before lunch. 
 I understand, but we can't release you without a complete workup. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 I play tennis with Bernie Goldstein, Chief of Orthopedics over at Northwestern. 
 If you can just brace my leg and get me on some crutches, I guarantee he'll get me in for an office visit first thing tomorrow morning. 
 Make your appointment. I'll check with my attending. 
 Great. 
 Thanks. 
 [exhales] 
 Hi. 
 I-I can wait for the next one. 
 Sorry, just needed to go out for a quick smoke. 
 That's not the first time I've got that look. 
 Don't worry, I didn't smoke when I was pregnant. 
 Well, you know, there is also secondhand smoke... 
 Yeah, or around the baby. 
 Okay. 
 I'm sorry. Sorry. 
 It's just, uh...  It's just the stress. 
 It's been really tough these last few months. 
 Is there anyone you'd like to call? 
 Maybe Grace's father, or... 
 I wouldn't know who to call. 
 You don't know who the father is? 
 It's not so much a matter of who. 
 It's more which. 
 There were a couple guys. 
 But you know, it doesn't even matter, because they all bailed when I told them I was pregnant, so... and then my parents, they thought I should terminate. 
 'Cause, you know, "A baby needs a father." 
 But no, no, I just...  I couldn't. 
 So here we are... 
 The two of us, just doing the best we can. 
 Chicago Med has a strict policy against forcible blood draws. 
 I got that. 
 Maggie might've been following hospital procedure, but from patrol's point of view, she obstructed a time-sensitive investigation. 
 And if we had delayed that operation, we could have put that boy's life in jeopardy. 
 Did you come here to argue or ask a favor? 
 Listen, Windham told me that kid was doing close to 80 in a 25 zone. 
 And that house he hit... 
 There was a family inside. 
 If they can't get DUI charges to stick, that kid is gonna post and be back behind the wheel in a couple of days. 
 They're not happy. 
 And you think I'm happy that one of my people is sitting behind bars? 
 Sharon, you overestimate my pull. 
 Hank, it's Maggie that's in there. 
 And I'm asking you as a friend, find a way to get her out. 
 Look, they're not gonna release her until after she's been processed and arraigned. 
 I'll see if I can have her moved up on the docket, but other than that, there's nothing I can do. 
 Can I at least see her? 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Maggie? 
 Sharon. 
 Girl, I am so sorry. 
 Hey, you got five minutes. 
 So I guess you're not here to take me home. 
 Not yet. 
 Voight said they can't release you until you've been arraigned. 
 They're actually gonna charge me for this? 
 Kalmick's got the gloves off. 
 We've got a good chance of getting the charges dropped or at least reduced. 
 Hell, I was doing my job. 
 You handled the situation exactly as I would've. 
 That blood draw would've left the hospital open for litigation. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Next time to fill out a credit application, that's what I'll tell them when they ask me, "Have you ever been arrested?" 
 Maggie, we're gonna get you through this. 
 You better. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Manning. 
 Yeah? 
 A word. 
 Sure. 
 Not only retinal hemorrhages, but we found a subdural hematoma and cerebral edema. 
 The classic diagnostic triad. 
 This is a case of Shaken Baby Syndrome. 
 Is there any other caregiver in the baby's life? 
 A nanny, her father? 
 Nope. 
 She did this. 
 And Dr. Grant agrees with your diagnosis of Shaken Baby Syndrome? 
 She does. 
 We both reviewed Grace's CT scans. 
 The findings are consistent with the neuropathological triad of SBS. 
 And you're certain there couldn't be any other explanation for the symptoms? 
 I cannot draw any other conclusion here other than child abuse. 
 [sighs] 
 Dr. Manning, once I pick up that phone and notify DCFS, it's out of our hands. 
 A mother intentionally harmed her child. 
 I think it's the right call to make. 
 Hey, how'd the surgery with the DUI kid go? 
 There was a pretty large laceration at the dome of the bladder, so it took a while to repair. 
 Uh, where's Maggie? I was wondering if she got ahold of the kid's parents yet. 
 You didn't hear? 
 Maggie got arrested. 
 She what? 
 Yeah, after we took the kid upstairs, they couldn't get the blood and charged her with obstruction. 
 I know. 
 Goodwin's working on getting her cut loose. 
 Ms. Reese, beautiful day, right? 
 I guess, it's kinda cold. 
 Hey, hey, is that for the gentleman in 3? 
 Yeah, Kevin Dietrich. 
 You know what? 
 Those buckles are actually a lot trickier than they look. 
 How about if I give you a little hand? 
 Okay, sure. 
 Mr. Dietrich, I'm Dr. Charles. 
 Hey. 
 How are you? 
 Good, good. 
 I have come to render an assist with this deceptively tricky brace. 
 Sure. 
 [chuckles] Chief of Psychiatry? 
 Technically, yeah. 
 Today, more like Chief of Physical Therapy. 
 I blew out my knee out on the slopes a couple years ago, got stuck with one of these suckers for a few months. 
 The trick is the buckles. 
 Okay. 
 Great, good to know. Thank you. 
 So, uh, how'd you do this? 
 Oh, just one of those mornings, completely overbooked. 
 Point is, I was running late... 
 And on your cell phone. 
 Right, I was on the phone with my insurance broker... 
 Need to up our homeowner's. 
 Anyway, so I stepped out into the crossing, tried to jump out of the way but couldn't. 
 So, boom, I'm on the ground. [chuckles] 
 Wow, hell of a morning. 
 Yeah, well, I'm just thankful for the intrepid Ms. Reese here for patching me up so I can get on with my day. 
 You know, you can't really drive like this. 
 So what...  should we call your wife? 
 No, no, the... 
 I just mean she's really busy. 
 Ah. 
 Billed nearly 80 hours last week. 
 So I don't want to bother her with something like this. 
 Great. Nice to meet ya. 
 Yeah, a pleasure. Thank you. 
 Ms. Reese, could I just see you for a sec? 
 [mouthing] 
 Could you do me a favor and give me a heads up before you discharge Mr. Dietrich? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Ahh. 
 Ahh. 
 Okay, good. 
 All right, we'll get her back as soon as possible. 
 You're Mommy's doctor. 
 You saved her. 
 Hi, Bailey. 
 What are you doing down here? 
 I need more markers. 
 Do your parents know where you are? 
 Uh-uh. 
 I'm sorry, we can't have that. 
 Come with me. 
 Hey, Leah, can you take Bailey back upstairs to the clinical trial wing? 
 I can't leave the desk, but I will find someone who can. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 I need more colors for my rainbow. 
 Wow, that's very pretty. 
 I'm making it for Mommy, to make her feel better. 
 Has she been sick? 
 Real sick. 
 Did something happen, Bailey? 
 She had to get a shot. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Manning, DCFS just arrived. 
 Ms. Fisher, this is Madeline Gastern from the Department of Child and Family Services. 
 I'm here to investigate a possible case of child abuse. 
 Child abuse? What, you think I hurt my baby? 
 That's crazy. 
 We need you to come with us. 
 What? No! No, no, I don't want to leave my baby. 
 No, you can't do this! I didn't hurt her! 
 You can't make me leave my baby! 
 I didn't hurt her! You can't do this! 
 I didn't hurt her! 
 You can't make me leave my baby! 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Ah, Dr. Charles, good news. I'm out of here. 
 Before you go, could I just talk to you for a sec? 
 Um... 
 Ms. Reese, do you mind excusing us for... for just a moment? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah, I really have to go. 
 I will not keep you for more than a minute. 
 I just want to understand a little better what happened this morning. 
 I already explained. It was an accident. 
 And I'm sorry, but I'm really late. 
 I understand. You're a very busy man. 
 Listen, off-the-wall question. 
 Have you been...  having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning recently? 
 No. I have to go. 
 Thanks. 
 Mr. Dietrich. 
 Excuse me. 
 [clears throat] 
 Mr. Dietrich, I'm sorry. 
 I can't let you leave just yet. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I am not convinced that it was an accident when you stepped in front of that car this morning. I think you were trying to kill yourself. 
 [laughs] What? 
 Dr. Charles. 
 And I'm, um...  I'm worried that you still might be a suicide risk. 
 And if you insist on leaving... 
 I do. 
 I'm going to have to place you under a temporary psychiatric hold. 
 [scoffs] This is ridiculous. 
 Well, Earl here is going to take you someplace quiet. 
 I... 
 And hopefully we can talk. 
 I will sue you and this entire hospital. 
 Thank you, Earl. 
 I'll have your medical license. 
 You can't...  You can't do this. 
 I can, actually. 
 What? 
 Back to work. 
 
 
 
 I've got a charge nurse in city hospital, an ongoing child-abuse investigation, and now you bring me this? 
 He tried to commit suicide, Sharon. 
 I wasn't about to let it happen again. 
 He's a successful lawyer with no past history of depression. 
 I know the type, okay? 
 Look, the way he recounted what happened, his need to sell this way too-detailed version of the narrative, right? 
 Look at this X-ray. 
 He took the impact directly above the knee... directly. 
 That means he stood in and took the brunt. 
 He wanted to get hit. 
 That's conjecture, Daniel. 
 You're usually not this quick to make a diagnosis. 
 With this condition, you become a master of disguise. 
 Just give me a little more time to see if I can get him to drop the mask, okay? Okay. 
 All right. Just find a way to do it without further complicating my life. 
 Is there something else? 
 I'll sure be glad when Maggie gets back. 
 Check your e-mail. 
 Advocate just sent over those medical files you requested on baby Grace. 
 Oh, right. 
 And I'm sorry it took so long. 
 They're just as backed up as we are today. 
 Sure. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Am I gonna be okay? 
 Yeah, you are. 
 Surgery went well. 
 Like, totally okay? 
 I want to be a pilot...  Naval aviator. 
 Do you realize what you did today? 
 Hmm? 
 Yeah, yeah, it was stupid. 
 Trev, you're awake. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Did you say anything to the police at the scene? 
 No. 
 Attaboy. 
 He did the right thing, refusing the blood draw. 
 Just talked to Sid Burstyn. 
 He thinks he might be able to make this all go away. 
 Great. 
 No one got seriously hurt, so it looks like we can all just move on, put this behind us. 
 Somebody got hurt. 
 You must be Dr. Rhodes. Thank you for everything. 
 We'll do a cystogram next week to see how your bladder's healing. 
 You can schedule it with radiology. 
 If you'll excuse me. 
 God, I wanted to pop that guy. 
 He's just like my dad, that same stupid sense of entitlement. 
 My DUI kid, he's ruined. 
 Connor, look, we don't get along. 
 You don't like me. But I need a favor, and there's no one else I can ask. 
 I have to access some records, and I can't use my code to log in. 
 Why not? 
 Because no one can know I looked at them. 
 You caught me on the right day. 
 It's my DNR patient, Jennifer Baker... 
 Don't tell me; I don't want to know anything about it. 
 [typing] 
 I realize this is a very uncomfortable situation, really. 
 Do you? 
 I don't have to talk to you. 
 Of course not. 
 I hope you will. 
 What does it matter? 
 I could tell you that I'm a happy man, that I have a perfect life, which I do. 
 But you've already got your mind made up about me. 
 Mr. Dietrich, I don't have my mind made up about anything. 
 I am genuinely here to help. 
 Help? 
 Yeah. 
 No, this is how you justify yourself. 
 Look at you. 
 So smug, so sure of yourself, like you know me. 
 You don't know me. 
 So go ahead, tell me what my problem is. 
 Tell you what your problem is? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 Enlighten me, Dr. Freud. 
 It doesn't really work that way. 
 Okay, wow. 
 So you don't know, do you? 
 This is your job, and you don't have a clue. 
 So you've got all those people fooled out there, huh? 
 You know what? Um, I think we are hitting a bit of a wall, so... 
 Yeah, you know why? 'Cause I shouldn't be here in the first place. 
 I'll check in on you later. 
 Okay, yup, hope you've got your malpractice premiums paid up. 
 Dr. Charles, has he admitted he tried to kill himself? 
 No, he says he's a happy man and has a perfect life. 
 So what are you going to do? 
 [sighs] 
 I don't know. 
 Great. 
 Thanks for letting me know, Hank. 
 [knock at door] Come in. 
 Tell her I'm on my way. 
 Dr. Rhodes, I hope you can make this quick. 
 I was the one that kept the cops from drawing that kid's blood, not Maggie. 
 If anybody should be held responsible, it's me. 
 And I'm gonna go turn myself in. 
 That's a nice gesture, but things don't work that way. 
 Besides, Maggie just made bail. 
 I'm going to pick her up now. 
 Ms. Goodwin. 
 Yeah? 
 These are baby Grace's records from Advocate South. 
 I made a horrible mistake. 
 We have to stop DCFS. 
 I'll go get Maggie. 
 Talk to me. 
 So if it's not Shaken Baby Syndrome... 
 Grace suffered an injury in utero... 
 An intracranial hemorrhage, which I believe occurred when her mother was in a car accident at 30 weeks gestation. 
 And this happened before the baby was even born? 
 Yes, when her prenatal ultrasounds were sent over from Advocate South, I showed them to Dr. Heller, head of radiology. 
 There's a small hematoma on the images. 
 It's easy to miss, but it is there. 
 But wouldn't the doctors have noticed it at birth? 
 It likely healed soon after the accident, and was asymptomatic. 
 But even the slightest bump on the head or a roll in her crib could have caused her to re-bleed. 
 And mimic the SBS triad. 
 Yes. 
 Let's go. 
 [knock at door] 
 [knocking] 
 [door opens] 
 Dr. Charles? 
 Yeah? 
 I'm sorry, but I texted you and didn't get an answer. 
 What is it, Ms. Reese? 
 Um, have you been back to see Mr. Dietrich? 
 No, I haven't. 
 Oh. 
 Dr. Charles, this isn't like you. 
 I mean, you never give up, and you always know what to say. 
 That's why we all admire you so much. 
 Ms. Reese, did it occur to you that you might be overstepping the bounds of a fourth-year medical student? 
 I'm sorry. 
 [sighs] 
 I told you I didn't hurt her. 
 I know. I am very sorry. 
 We all are. 
 You people are horrible. 
 Ms. Fisher, please understand, we were following hospital protocol. 
 Whenever there's a case of suspected abuse, we have to take it seriously. 
 You started judging me the second I walked in here. 
 So does this mean my Gracie ain't sick? 
 No, I'm sorry, but, symptomatically, your child is still in the same condition. 
 We can't be certain how her development might be affected. 
 We'd like to keep her here for monitoring... 
 No, no, no, no, I don't want you or anybody else at this hospital taking care of my baby. 
 How soon can I get her out of here? 
 We'll check with Dr. Grant to see when she can be discharged. 
 I want to go see her now. 
 Of course. 
 Mr. Dietrich, how you doing? 
 You know what? I am gonna tell you why I think you threw yourself in front of that car. 
 It's precisely because you think you have the perfect life, and you're still miserable. 
 So, what, I'm an ingrate? 
 No, it's called endogenous depression, and it's caused by your brain chemistry. 
 And like so many people who suffer from depression, you're ashamed to tell anybody about it, 'cause you think it's your fault. 
 [laughs] 
 Okay, yeah, I'm...  I bet. Sure, sure. 
 Okay, look, why don't you call your wife? 
 Tell her where you are and why you're here. 
 She's an attorney; she can get you out of here in five minutes. 
 She knows what to do. 
 What, you don't want to...  What... 
 You don't want to call her? 
 Why? Are you worried that maybe, if she finds out that you're not the brave, strong man she married, she might not love you anymore? 
 Do you know that the single greatest challenge that I face is trying to convince people that depression isn't a sign of weakness? 
 Okay, I'll remember that if I'm ever depressed. 
 Okay. 
 [taps the bed] 
 You know, I got to hand it to you. 
 You are... you're one hell of a performer. 
 I mean, a real trouper. 
 I mean, keeping it up for so long. 
 You know, selling this idea of who you think you need to be, all the time... 
 Carrying around the weight of that... performance. 
 Isn't it tiring? 
 Aren't you exhausted? 
 I think it'd be exhausting. 
 [soft laugh] 
 I have absolutely no excuse to be sad. 
 You don't need an excuse, man. 
 You're a human being. 
 [scoffs] 
 [crying] 
 [sniffles] [cries] 
 You're, um... 
 You're not alone, Mr. Dietrich. 
 [exhales] 
 So what's the story? 
 Sharon didn't need to send a trauma surgeon to pick me up. 
 I wanted to do it. I felt bad. 
 Why, 'cause I'm the one who got busted? 
 Mm. 
 Listen, I know you think that, because you're a trauma surgeon, you're the boss. 
 But the ED's mine, and nothing happens in my kingdom that I don't take responsibility for. 
 You're right, you're right. 
 Maybe...  the system's rigged... and it pisses me off. 
 Pisses you off? 
 I have sat in jail. 
 My buddy and I... Summer before I went to college, we got busted trying to buy drugs off of an undercover cop. 
 You? 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, come on, at that age, you think you're invincible, right? 
 Turns out, only one of us was right. 
 My dad pulled some strings, and he got me off. 
 What about your friend? 
 Well, his dad didn't own a department store. 
 Turns out the lifeboat was only big enough for one of us, so I had a choice. 
 I could stand by my friend, or I could jump in. 
 So I jumped in the boat. 
 I'm honored that you would share this with me, but if you want to make amends, you need to call your friend. 
 I can't. 
 He died of an overdose before I could... 
 Before I could work up the nerve. 
 Zoe... 
 Hey. 
 Jennifer Baker had a pulmonary embolism four days ago. 
 How'd you hear that? 
 I saw her chart. 
 Will, the woman is suing you. 
 If you accessed those records, they'll know. 
 Someone did it for me. 
 Dr. Manning? 
 No. That's not important. 
 The records show that her doctors prescribed heparin to dissolve the clot. 
 So? 
 Heparin is contraindicated for use with the medication being used in her drug trial. 
 That means Jennifer's not on the medication. 
 She's on the placebo. 
 Oh, Will, I'm so sorry. 
 She's going to die if we don't get her switched over to the active drug. 
 Is there anything you can do to make that happen? 
 What? 
 You know the oncologist running the trial, right? 
 Maybe you can petition. 
 I-I-I can't. 
 It would compromise the whole trial. 
 All right, then we'll do something without him knowing. 
 Like back-date a scan. 
 No, Will, please. God. 
 Listen, I am asking you for this... for this one thing, for me...  To let this go. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't. 
 [sighs] 
 What's wrong with her? 
 What's going on? 
 She's seizing. 
 What's wrong? Please, help her! 
 Get the crash cart and page Dr. Grant. 
 What's her Broselow? 
 She's pink on the tape. 
 Push .7 milligrams of Lorazepam. 
 .7, I got it. 
 All right, sats are 66. 
 Start bagging her. 
 What's wrong with her? What's going on? 
 She's stopped breathing. 
 [sobs] 
 Sats are coming up. 
 Is she breathing? 
 She's postictal and protecting her airway. 
 Let's get another head CT and page pediatric neurology. 
 This is what you were talking about, huh? 
 Yes, seizures can be a part of her condition. 
 How long will she have 'em? 
 I don't know. 
 Her whole life? 
 I don't know. 
 [baby crying] 
 That woman has a long road ahead of her. 
 They both do. 
 You know, there are maybe 17 different agencies ready to jump in when they suspect abuse. 
 But who jumps in to help when it's a single mother who's struggling? 
 You know, she's right. 
 I did judge her. 
 And you know why? 
 Because I can imagine it. 
 Owen is bawling his head off at 3:00 in the morning. 
 And I am exhausted, and I have no one I can hand him to. 
 So yeah, I can imagine it. 
 And there isn't a mother alive who hasn't. 
 The difference is, you won't do it. 
 And neither did she. 
 It's Maggie. 
 Look who's back. 
 Maggie. 
 Dr. Rhodes said you were covering for me. 
 Yes, and thank God you are back. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up. 
 That's okay. If he was driving Uber, he'd get five stars. 
 I was worried about you. 
 I'm fine. 
 Why is everybody standing around? 
 Back to work, Reese. 
 Chop chop. 
 You're Dr. Rhodes? 
 Yeah. 
 I had it checked. 
 Dr. Halstead used your code to access Jennifer Baker's records, didn't he? 
 Look, I-I didn't... 
 I don't care about any of it. 
 He found out that she's only on a placebo. 
 I'm afraid he's going to tell her. 
 I'll handle it. 
 [panting] 
 Eighth floor. Clinical trial wing, seriously? 
 When I helped you out earlier, I didn't think it was gonna lead to this. 
 What do you care? 
 Well, I'm not going to stand by and watch another guy ruin his life. 
 Hey! 
 No. 
 [alarm ringing] 
 You're not gonna stop me. 
 Actually, I am. 
 Hey. 
 [struggling] 
 Damn it! 
 [grunts] 
 You're not supposed to go near her. 
 You tell her she's on a placebo, that's your license, okay? 
 She can go home! 
 You're a good doctor. 
 The world needs good doctors, you ass. 
 [panting] 
 [alarm stops, elevator hums] 
 Ms. Reese. 
 Hmm? 
 Um, I was unkind to you, and I hope that you'll allow me to apologize. 
 It's okay. 
 You were sleeping. 
 I woke you. 
 That is a good way to put it. 
 You don't like Chicago-style popcorn? 
 Mixing caramel with cheese flavors? Sweet and salty... It's the greatest duo. I thought the great duo was Jordan and Pippen. Oh. [sighs] I've been off my meds. Since when? I started titrating myself down about ten days ago. I'm sorry. It was a little chemistry experiment. I really should have told you during our last session. How's the experiment going? Not great. The black cloud is descending. There ain't no denying it. Why did you go off? About a month ago, I just... I started to feel fuzzy, you know? Like I was losing my edge, like my antenna... I mean, you know the focus that it takes to treat patients. I was worried that I was gonna make a mistake. Danny, you also can't treat patients if you're depressed. You'd think I would've figured that out by now. Let me adjust your dose. We'll figure out a balance. Okay. Hey, there you go. So, how was your day? You save some lives? Okay, got it. Not feeling chatty.
