 [indistinct speech over PA] 
 This is the main entrance, though it's not really private. 
 So this is where he's... 
 You can take a look. 
 Hi. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Is that really you? 
 Aww. 
 And look at you, like you were never even pregnant. 
 [laughs] 
 How are your boobs feeling? 
 Besieged. 
 That'll happen. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [laughs] 
 Cover this side. 
 [speaking Arabic] 
 What's with all the suits? 
 Some mucky-muck flying into town for heart surgery. 
 This is what they call an advance team. 
 And here I thought you were rolling out the red carpet for me. 
 Sorry. 
 But I'm glad to see you. 
 I'm surprised you didn't ask for a couple more weeks. 
 Well, it's been a month. 
 I was just joking. 
 You mean you don't think I'm a bad mom? 
 Juvie. Respiratory distress. 
 All right. 
 Welcome back, Dr. Manning. 
 Thank you. 
 Trauma 2. 
 I'll get your stuff. 
 Thanks. 
 All tenens to the ED. 
 13-year-old female, Michelle. 
 Worsened on the ride. This is her father. 
 Michelle, I'm Dr. Manning. I'm gonna take care of you. 
 When did this start? 
 20 minutes ago. 
 Is she asthmatic? 
 No. 
 Bee sting? Something she ate? 
 Definitely not something she ate. 
 How can you be sure? 
 Because she never eats anything I don't prepare for her. 
 All right, we're gonna move her on my count. 
 One, two, three. 
 [wheezing, gasping] 
 Call respiratory for a vent, stat, and get a crash cart in here. 
 Yes, Dr. Manning. 
 She's in bronchospasm. 
 Breathe, breathe. 
 Draw up .3 milligrams of EPI, 1/1000, and give it IM. 
 Got it. 
 I'm not sure that's safe. 
 She's on other medications. 
 What medications? 
 Metoprolol, and Tegretol for her seizures, Methadone for her pain... 
 Methadone? 
 She has Mitochondrial Disease. 
 It affects her body's ability to produce... 
 I'm familiar with Mito. 
 Stats are dropping. 
 All right, we can't wait for respiratory. 
 We need to intubate. 
 Get me 20 of Etomidate, 80 of Sux. 
 [wheezing] 
 She's spasmed down. Where are the drugs? 
 I lost the IV. I'm trying again on this side. 
 We don't have time. We need to crich her. 
 Get me a 10cc syringe and a 16-gauge needle, now. 
 What is happening? 
 Sir, I need you to step out. 
 Don't tell me what to do. 
 My daughter is dying and you're letting her. 
 Now! 
 Sir, step back. 
 No, look... It's all right, kiddo. 
 Needle, now. 
 Here, doctor. 
 Go ahead and hang another liter. 
 Stand by.

 [gasps] 
 I'm okay. 
 I'm okay! 
 Hold off. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I'm okay. 
 [panting] 
 Sats are improving. 
 Let's get a face mask on her. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 Oh, thank God you pulled out of it. 
 Sorry I scared you, Dad. 
 Are you okay? 
 Am  I  okay? 
 [laughs] 
 Listen to you. 
 Oh, you silly girl. 
 Deep breaths, deep breaths. 
 I've never seen someone improve like that so quick. 
 You? 
 No. 
 You had a G-tube implanted? 
 Helps with her nutrition. 
 She's not the greatest eater. 
 We IV her supplements and vitamins. 
 My smoothie. 
 And the, uh... 
 Central line catheter? 
 It's for all her meds. 
 Mm. 
 She's good to go. 
 You are a very brave girl. 
 Got that from her mother. 
 My wife died four years ago. 
 Breast cancer. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Not long after that's when kiddo here started getting sick. 
 Migraines, fatigue, IBS. 
 For a while, I figured it was just part of the mourning process, but it kept happening. 
 I got that. 
 I took her to... I don't know how many doctors, but nobody knew what was wrong, so I went online and found out about Mito. 
 You went online for that? 
 For the first time, what Michelle was going through finally made sense. 
 Good news, we know what it is. 
 Bad news, there's no cure. 
 So we manage. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I'd like to do a full workup before discharging her. 
 See if we can find what caused those spasms. 
 Could take a couple of hours. 
 You guys okay with that? 
 Do what you do. 
 We're old pros. 
 Never leave home unprepared, just in case we end up in the hospital. 
 This way. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Well, it looks like royalty's arrived. 
 You're referring to him... or him? 
 Princes come and go, but there's only one King Downey. 
 Ah, yes, Your Highness. 
 Welcome. [speaks Arabic] 
 Guy's a surgical rock star. 
 This prince flies halfway around the world to have him replace his valve. 
 This is the place we want to be. 
 Come on, your room's ready. 
 Downey, number one with a bullet. 
 Although, I suppose if that were true, you'd be yanking it out of him, wouldn't you? 
 Doctor Rhodes, they're ready for you in OR 2. 
 Thank you, Maggie. 
 This woman stabbed her husband in the right flank with a pair of scissors. 
 Sounds like they could use a marriage counselor. 
 [laughs] 
 Mr. Mason, I'm Dr. Halstead. 
 So, tell me, when did this pain start? 
 Who let this man in the hospital? 
 Who let this man become a doctor? 
 Whoa, gentlemen. 
 [both laughing] 
 I take it you two kids know each other? 
 I had the pleasure of serving time on a carrier with this man, Chief Petty Officer Mason. 
 Choi. 
 Great to see you, Chief. 
 What are you doing in Chicago? 
 I retired two years ago, and, uh... 
 Let's catch up after we let the doc here do his thing. 
 Nothing doing. 
 You come to Chicago Med, you get me. 
 Chart, please. 
 You're in good hands. 
 Honor to meet you. 
 So... what brings you in here? 
 I feel like I swallowed a fishhook. 
 [both chuckle] 
 Well, let's take a look. 
 There you are. 
 Heard you were back. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How's Owen? 
 He liking that mobile thing I hung up? 
 Mesmerized. He can't stop staring at it. 
 Success. 
 Wasn't the same without you. 
 I'm glad to be back. 
 I just hope my son forgives me. 
 Of course he will. 
 Absence makes the heart grow fonder. 
 I'm not that absent. 
 Oh, no, I didn't... 
 I didn't mean any... 
 I'm sorry; I'm exhausted. 
 I...  it's just... It's our first day apart. 
 Absolutely. First day. 
 What's all this? 
 My 13-year-old's medical history. 
 Dad keeps a copy of everything in the car just in case. 
 This is all for a 13-year-old? 
 Girl presents with bronchospasm. 
 I get this close to criching her. 
 The moment her father leaves her side... 
 [snaps fingers] 
 She catches her breath. 
 Like magic. 
 The kid's a budding Harry Potter. 
 She has mitochondrial disease. 
 Mito? 
 We really are talking fiction here. 
 You don't think it exists? 
 Always felt like a wastebasket diagnosis to me. 
 Doctor can't figure out what's really going wrong, says it's Mito, calls it a day. 
 Hmm. 
 What did the muscle biopsy say? 
 That I don't know, because I haven't found it yet. 
 Want a second set of eyes? 
 Yes, thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 [both giggling] 
 Okay, here you go. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 See you. Okay, bye. 
 Oh, my God. You guys are so cute. 
 We're just friends. 
 Uh-huh. 
 [laughs] 
 Another dating app? 
 Why? You go to any bar, and there's a line around the block to buy you a drink. 
 Oh, well, at least these guys know how to type, for the most part. 
 Look at this one. 
 Profile name, "Windy City Winner." 
 Nope. 
 [both laugh] 
 Another idiot without a shirt. 
 Oh. 
 That's... 
 Joey. 
 "Cold Tech, Warm Heart." 
 It says his favorite thing is watching the Chicago skyline at night from Promontory Point. 
 Please, he hardly ever leaves his computer. 
 [clears throat] 
 Hate to drag you two ladies away from electronic romance... 
 Oh, my gosh! [laughter] 
 But Treatment Five awaits. 
 [girls laughing] 
 Have fun. 
 [both shrieking and laughing] 
 Okay. 
 I need everything to stop spinning. 
 Okay. You brought her in? 
 Sloane's my girl. 
 Ride or die since junior high, and we're college roommates. 
 She appears inebriated. 
 I only had two glasses of wine. 
 She told me she was staying in to study for her environmental studie. 
 Bacteria. 
 Yes, look...  going over things from her field trips. 
 I'm so sorry, Ames. 
 Don't deserve you. 
 It's okay, Sloaney. 
 Her knee appears swollen. 
 Well, she did fall in the shower this morning. 
 Well, often, in college, people find out their actual limits, and she exceeded hers. 
 You got wasted like this a lot? 
 No, not me. Never once. 
 Maybe once. 
 All right, let's draw some labs, start an IV, get her on a liter of normal saline, see if we can't sober her up. 
 Yep. 
 [machine beeping] 
 99.3. 
 A little hot, that's all. 
 That's it? 
 That, my friend, is it. 
 You don't want to run a CAT scan or something? 
 CAT scan? 
 It's pretty standard, isn't it? 
 Not with what I'm seeing, unless there's something you haven't told me. 
 When I go to the bathroom, there's blood in my stool. 
 Blood. 
 Bright red? Dark? 
 Dark. 
 How long has that been going on? 
 About three months. 
 And you're just seeing a doctor now? 
 Can you roll over on your side? 
 [scoffs] 
 You know what's coming. 
 [sighs] 
 But it'll just be for a few seconds. 
 We call this the Chicago Med handshake. 
 [grunts] 
 Okay, done. 
 Chief, we are gonna do that CAT scan after all. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Not a scratch on the liver, but a hole in the diaphragm. 
 She got him good. 
 Uh, Doctor Downey. 
 Good morning. 
 What's he doing here? 
 The patient, Marty.

 [bed whirs] ♪ ♪ Hmm. Do you know this patient? No. ♪ ♪ Ah. Are there any concerns, Dr. Downey? No. ♪ ♪ And we are...  done. ♪ ♪ What did he want? I have no idea. [elevator dings] [crowd speaking Arabic] Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. It's a fricking Rose Bowl parade in here. Well, the prince has a lot of well-wishers. Is he gifting David a polo pony this time? I thought I saw a saddle back there. Do I sense a tinge of jealousy, or are you just upset because I let him use your parking spot? Look, Hawaiian shirts aside, I think David is a lovely man. It's, frankly, our priorities that I tend to question. Look at this ED, Daniel. You don't get this without that. Downey helps make Chicago Med a destination hospital. Yeah, like Disneyland. [laughs quietly] Right? Hi, Michelle. How are you feeling? Well... Not great, to be honest. I'm wondering if we should adjust her IV fluids? Okay. Well, we'll look into that. This is Dr. Halstead; I've asked him to join us. Thank you, by the way, for keeping such a detailed account of Michelle's history. Yeah, well, sometimes it feels like a full-time job. I bet. Well, we were looking over her records and didn't come across any results for a muscle biopsy. Do you know if one was ever performed? No, we haven't done a biopsy. Uh-huh. I highly recommend one. It's really the only way to confirm a diagnosis of Mito. Well, no, the doctor was concerned how Michelle would react to the anesthesia. What's he talking about, Daddy? Nothing, kiddo. You know, she should rest. I'll be right outside. Can we chat outside? ♪ ♪ What are you doing? Just trying to confirm... Michelle has Mito. If I wanted her retested, I'd ask. I came here because she was having trouble breathing and this was the closest hospital. I didn't come here to debate her diagnosis. We're just trying to find a way to help your daughter start feeling better. No, Dr. Halstead thinks he knows better than her father. I was not questioning... Oh, the hell you weren't. Daddy? My stomach... Michelle? Are you okay? Pulse is strong. Pupils are equal. IV? It's good. April, ammonia ampule. Got it. Anything you need? Thanks, we got it. We need to take a look at that hand. Do something. Dr. Halstead. Thank you. [gasps] Michelle? [gasping] Okay, Michelle? It's okay, kiddo. It's okay. I'm here. Daddy's right here. [gasps] Daddy! Yeah. [whimpering] You still want to convince yourselves there's nothing wrong with her? [crying] ♪ ♪ I'm guessing, by your expression, it doesn't look good. It doesn't. You have a large mass partially obstructing your right colon, which explains the symptoms you've been experiencing. I can't be sure, but... in all likelihood, I... Colon cancer, right? My doctor at the VA, she thought this might be what it was. Wait, you have a doctor at the VA who knew your symptoms and hasn't had you scanned yet? Dr. Glass, but it... It wasn't her fault, okay? She's been beating the drum for me. [scoffs] It's that VA. They got their own special pace. Slow. Hey, you think I'll make it another week? What happens in a week? Reunion. You know, all the chiefs from the Vinson who were deployed to Haiti, helping out after the quake. I remember. You'll be at that reunion, Chief. How's that feel? Is that okay, Michelle? How's your stomach feeling now? A little better. It never feels great, though. That's why I'm so lucky to have my dad. He's always there to take care of me. Now, where else would I be, kiddo? Hey. How's that, uh... young lady doing? I wish there was a simple answer to that. How about the un-simple one? So something's clearly wrong with her, but Mito? I'm not buying it. Could it just be all the medication? The girl's a walking pharmacy. Who knows how she's reacting to all those drugs? Ideally, I'd wean Michelle off everything and establish a new baseline. You think the dad would go for that? Not a chance. The guy is dead set it's Mito. I...  I got a weird feeling here, doc. It...  it's like... they've built their lives around this disease. Huh. I don't know, Will. It feels like something worth investigating to me. Yeah, I think it'd be great if you went and talked to them. What, I walk in there? A shrink? No, it'd change the whole dynamic. You'd never get a clean read. I need to watch them without them knowing I'm watching them. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Dr. Rhodes, your presence has been requested on the fifth floor. Dr. Downey wants to speak with you. Yeah, yeah, I'll come up. He'll be right up. Well, let me know what he wants. Yeah. Hey... [snaps fingers] How's our patient in five? Still sleeping it off. Um...  about that profile? I'm wondering if it's something Joey just had up and forgot to take down. Does it say the last time he was on? Mm... He was last active... today. Today? Mm-hmm. Excuse me. I had a question I wanted to ask you. What's it like being a doctor? Oh, not a doctor. Fourth-year med student. Oh, I'm premed. Does the work load ever calm down? No, just gets worse. Miles, my boyfriend, is about ready to dump my ass. Last night, he begs me to go see some band at Metro, Well, in my experience, med school and guys don't mix. Most of them are liars and cheats anyway. You say, "Let's take it slow," and for them, that means a license to sleep around. [clears throat] Seizure in Five! [dramatic music] [grunting] Get one milligram of Ativan, and grab the attending. Thank you. I've got her airway. Oh, my God. Have you ever seen her have a seizure before? No. Where's that Ativan? [grunting] How often does she drink like this? Is it possible she's detoxing? No way Sloane's a closet alkie. We don't keep secrets from each other. All of this from one night of drinking doesn't make sense. [heart monitor beeping] ♪ ♪ [classical music] Dr. Rhodes. Nice work down there. Thank you. So my angels tell me you spent time in Riyadh? Your angels are correct. I was there last year helping injured oil workers. How's your Arabic? [speaking Arabic] Sounds good to me. Come on, I want you to meet somebody. 
 
 [elevator bell dings] So here it is. Hyponatremia? Yeah, her sodium levels are pretty low. 119. Her... [sighs] Glucose is 74, so she's not diabetic. Her blood alcohol is negative. What caused her... Hey. Her seizure? Is everything okay? You know, with us? You on that app too? What? No. What are you doing on it? I mean... you said you like to take it slow and get to know a person. Yeah, get to know one person, not get to know me while you date half of Chicago. No, I'm not dating half of... And the Chicago skyline? When's the last time you were even outside at night? There'll be a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, full bypass, hemodilution. Now, I like it because it gives us a clear field, so we can completely remove the blockage. Would you like me to translate this into Arabic? Why would you need to do that? I see that I don't. So surgery's set for 3:00. Make yourself comfortable while my team preps. Stop worrying. You're making me nervous. You certainly don't want that while I'm operating. We'll see you in a bit. [chuckles] I'm not a CT surgeon, but bypass for pulmonary thrombus isn't common, is it? Who wants common? I know my patient doesn't. You okay with common? Dr. Downey, what exactly am I doing here? You're helping me prep for surgery. I guess so. Did he eat? Oh, okay, good. Good. And you're sure you have enough milk? Okay, because you know, I'm really close; I could always come... Okay. All right, well, call me if you need anything. You know, I'm, um... just ten minutes away. I'll call you in a little bit, okay? Give Owen a kiss for me. Okay, bye. There's something you need to see. That feel okay? Do you need anything? No, water's fine. Notice how normal she is with April, and then...  and then her dad walks in. Hey. How you doing, kiddo? Hanging in the And her smile disappears. Hey, Dad. I can't hold that cup. Can you bring it Of course, sweetheart. See, so before, she's drinking on her own, and now, all of a sudden, she needs her dad's help. It's like she's instantly self-infantilizing. Why would you do this? Because I asked him to. Without consulting me? This is my patient. You know, I ought to haul your ass up in front of the ethics committee. This is an absolute violation of patient rights, and you know that. I do, Sharon, but we could be looking at a case of medical child abuse here. Child abuse? Mr. Joffe is overbearing, but he's clearly not intending to hurt Michelle. Of course not. He's trying to save her, but that's precisely why we would refer to this as a conversion disorder. My gut is telling me this entire relationship is driven by her being sick and him taking care of her. Hold on. Even if it's not Mito, her symptoms could still be explained by something else. A Chiari malformation, maybe? Before I call this guy an abuser, I want to rule everything else out. As soon as Michelle can stand, he's gonna take her home, and then we're out of options. Okay. You erase that footage immediately. Dr. Manning, I understand how you feel, and I want you to run whatever tests you deem necessary to narrow your differential diagnosis; however, if there is even a 1% chance of abuse taking place, we have an obligation here. So what do you need to make a clear call? I need to talk with Michelle without her father present. All right. This is how we're gonna make that happen. All right, Michelle. Here's the MRI machine we're gonna be using. It's still warming up, but we have Dr. Charles here to keep us company until it's ready. Are you okay with that? Hi, Michelle. Hi. What kind of doctor are you? I am the kind of doctor whose job it is to make sure you don't get nervous about getting in that machine. I'm not scared. I'm used to this kind of stuff. Me and my dad are in hospitals all the time. Hmm. Well, we're hoping to make it so that you don't have to be in them so much. How does that sound? Okay. Good. [mumbling indistinctly] Six teaspoons of gunpowder green tea. Boiling water. [teakettle whistling] [tropical melody plays] [sighs] [man singing indistinct] Gently. Arabic tea. This helps you prep for surgery? Swirl. Pour. Make sure the tea stays in the pot. Sugar. Mint. Stir. Slowly. Don't want to change the viscosity. Viscosity? Wait; that's why you use hemodilution to allow bypass without reperfusion injury? Should be done. Tea with mint. That's Moroccan, not Saudi. It's not for the prince. Thank you, Dr. Rhodes. You can go. That's it? You did a nice job. [tropical melody continues] ♪ ♪ I remember Dad got tickets to a play that day, "Wicked." Oh, my daughter wanted me to take her to that. Was it good? I don't know; I never saw it. I went into my dad's room to see if he was ready, but he was looking at pictures of my mom and being sad, so... I went back to my room. Then what happened? I have got to confess, I am so jealous of those socks. Those hedgehogs are fantastic. Okay, so you went back to your room, and... Oh, I just waited for a long time, and then my stomach started to hurt, and I got dizzy, and I yelled out for my dad, and then... And he came? Yeah, he came. He picked me up and took me to the hospital. Since then, it's been like this a lot. And how's your dad been doing? Does, uh... Does he still get sad? Not so much. I guess I keep him pretty busy. Makes sense. So. We, uh...  we good? We should be all set. Thank you, Mr. Joffe. Now, if you can sign just three more forms, I promise you'll be done. Dr. Manning's been down in radiology with my daughter for over an hour. Would you like me to page her? No. I'll just go down there. Oh, I'm sorry, you can't be in the room while your daughter's having an MRI. Yeah, that's what she said, but I'm not waiting around anymore. Mr. Joffe? I'm Dr. Charles. Could I talk to you for a second? Yeah, why? Well, it's about your daughter. There's a consultation room right over here if you have a couple minutes. No, you know what? If you have something to say, can you just say it? There is a strong possibility that your daughter's medical issues have a psychological component to them. What the hell are you talking about? It's very important that you understand that I wouldn't be telling you this unless I perceived significant risk to both you and your daughter, but I want you to consider the possibility that when your wife died, your daughter might have misunderstood your attempts to protect her from your grief. Her isolation... Wait, what? So I've been making her sick? That's what you're accusing me of? It's much more complicated than that. No, but it's my fault. I'm to blame. That's actually not what I'm saying. If you'd hear me out... I cannot believe you people. I am not going to stand here and listen to this. I'm going to get my daughter and get here out of here. Michelle! Excuse me, my daughter's having an MRI. Where is that? Right over there, sir. Where's my daughter? She's still in the MRI machine. Well, turn it off. I'm taking her home now. I'm sorry, sir, but we can't do that. No, please... Mr. Joffe! Please, Mr. Joffe. Open this door. Please, Mr. Joffe. Open this door! Mr. Joffe? Madeline Gastern. We are from the Department of Child and Family Services. What the hell is going on here? A charge of medical child abuse has been brought against you by this hospital. Child abuse? That is a legal term only, Mr. Joffe... Michelle will be taken into custody by the state while the charge is investigated. What are you talking about? I'm sorry; I know this must be confusing, but we need to sit down with you and explain why this has happened. ♪ ♪ You. You set this up, didn't you? No... Shame on you. Mr. Joffe... You... Stay away from me. Let me tell you something. You people have picked the wrong battle. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Dr. Ethan Choi from Chicago Med. I've left a few messages for Dr. Glass. We have a patient of hers here who needs... Please don't put me on hold again. I'm aware of that, but... [phone clattering] Unbelievable. Maggie, I'm taking an hour of personal time. I wouldn't do it if it wasn't important. Why are you still here? Hey, heard one of your old shipmates was here. How's he doing? Not good. I'm headed to the VA to crack some heads. You want me to come with? Power in numbers? I'll be okay. Thanks. [indistinct chatter] You look a little lost. I'm not sure what's going on with my patient. Her labs are inconsistent with how she presents. Whenever I get confused, I always go back to the history and the physical. It's the best place to find answers. [both laughing] [clears throat] I need to know everything you ate and drank last night. I already told you. Two glasses of white wine. That's it. And a ton of water 'cause I didn't want a hangover. What's a "ton"? Like, six or seven of those bottled waters. I would have had more if it wasn't so expensive. Expensive? You said you were at home. I was. What is this? "Metro"? Were you there last night? No. You went to Metro? Oh, my God. You were there with Miles, weren't you? Did you hook up with him? Oh, my God. I can't believe it. I'm so stupid. Amy... You're a liar and a bitch. Amy... I hope you get an STD and it kills you. [clears throat] Let's get a urine tox. If she took ecstasy, that would explain her thirst. Right. By the way... wow. [indistinct conversation] Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm looking for Dr. Vicky Glass. Over there. Dr. Glass? Yes. Lieutenant Commander Choi, Naval Reserve. I'm a resident at Chicago Med. Chief Mason came into our ED complaining of stomach pains. We did a CT and found this. This cancer could kill him, something that could have been prevented if you'd run a scan three months ago when he first told you about his symptoms. Well, I couldn't get him in for the scan. Believe me, I wanted to. I did everything I could to make it happen, but as you can see, there's a huge backlog here... And you're underfunded and understaffed. I don't care. These guys deserve better. You can't get a scan approved; go through back channels. Oh, you mean screw protocol? Yes, screw protocol. Hey, that's an idea. After all, the VA pays for ER care if a patient can't get to a VA hospital. Well, I could just tell him what to say to get a CAT scan and send him to you. That what you mean? Yeah. Good. We done chatting here? 'Cause I've got to get Mason in to see a surgeon. It might be too late. I just got the results. Wanted to bring them as soon as I got them. You didn't have to do that. Wow. Her UTox is negative. No drugs. [sighs] I am out of ideas. I need to talk to an attending. I'm taking down my online profile. Whatever. Don't do it on my account. Go have fun. "Fun"? I...  I've been on one awful date. She asked me to go on a hike, and I got bit by a spider. It still hasn't healed. Did you hear me? Do you care? Environmental studies, dehydrated, the puffy knee... We have one more test to run. What happened? Massive lower GI bleed. We're taking him to surgery now. Ethan, he could lose his colon. Maybe worse. I promised he'd make a Naval reunion next week.
