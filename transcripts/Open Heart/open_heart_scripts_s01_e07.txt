 ♪♪ 
 Mikayla : (Shivering) So cold... 
 And I'm about to blow curfew. Dylan : There's no name for this loft. Mikayla : I'm hungry... And I have to pee. (Dialing beeps) Okay, my mom's probably worrying by now. (Busy signal beeps) Mikayla : (Sighs) Great! Okay. Come on, let's go. Dylan : No, Mikayla, we have to sit on this place. See who's coming and going. Mikayla : Curfew, Dylan! Dylan : I don't have a curfew. Mikayla : Neither does Wes. Did you try calling Wes? Maybe he wants to do a stakeout. Dylan : No, Mikayla, Wes isn't gonna wanna do that. Mikayla : You know what? I'm sorry, but I... I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow! I'm sorry. (Taxi purrs to a stop) (Door opens and bangs shut) (Taxi rumbles away) (Camera shutter clicks) (Car honks, dance music blares) Driver : Shame to hide that face under a Hood! Dylan : That line actually work on anyone, Teddy?! Teddy : Worked on you. Rayna : Oh, Dylan! Oh my God! I haven't seen you since I went to rehab! Yeah, how'd that work out for you, Rayna? Rayna : A-mazing! (Car honks) You must get in this car. Teddy : She's right. Get in, let's go. Can't do it... Court orders. Since when do you follow the rules? (Car horn blasts) All right! God! Well, have fun without us, Dylan... If that's even possible! (Laughs) (Engine roars) ♪♪ (Heartbeat pulses) (Low hum of chatter) Seth : You have to call. Donnie : Absolutely not. Seth : Are you crazy? Call them. If you don't, I will! London : Seth?! What're you doing here? Seth : Um... um, looking for you! Yeah, just wanted to make sure we're still on for tonight. (Light kiss) London : Uh... (Giggles) Of course! Um... do you two know each other? Seth : Nope. We don't. Donnie : Never seen this cat before in my life! (Light knock) Dr. K : Everything under control here, Dr. Blake? London : Uh... Seth : I'll... see you later. London : Wait! Seth! Dr. K : I gotta go be in this photo thing. London : Oh... yeah, ev-everything's fine. I guess. (Sighs heavily) (Low hum of chatter) Got your favourite. Two sugars, right? Wes : I'm already coffeed up. Dylan : Sure you can't use another? So I think I found my dad's hiding place, but there's a problem... solo stakeouts aren't really a thing. Do you know a volunteer without a curfew who can help? Wes : I doubt it. Dylan : Come on, it'll be fun. We can play good-cop, cute-cop. I'm sure you can figure out who the cute-cop is. Wes, come on. Please, stop freezing me out. Hud took me to a place that my dad drew and that's it. Really? And nothing else happened? Of course not. Wes : You know it sucks, right? Liking someone who doesn't like you back. (Sighs) He hates me. He doesn't hate you. He's just hurt. And I'm the reason. But I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Can you just please come with me and stake out the loft tonight? I can't tonight... Because of Jared. He's making you work a double? No... we're hanging out. Good Lord. (Sighs heavily) So I have no one. Well, that's not true. Uh... Wes will come around. (Chairs scrape noisily) Jared : Easy. We gotta get this picture shot and off to the printer ASAP so we can start promoting the blood drive. We have to beat last year's record. Who cares? Things went south with Dylan, huh? So weird how you blew it with a girl and I didn't. Do you like apples? Wes : I'm gonna... choke you if you don't stop talking. Jared : (Amused) Oh yeah? (Low hum of chatter) Ah yes, all the hospital's finest. All right, everyone up here. Uh... Uh, Dr. and Mrs. Blake, stand right there. Dr. and Mrs. Blake : Okay. Jared : Uh, Dr. Hudson, here. Hud : Oh, I see what he's doing. He's putting all the good looking people together. Helena : (Flattered) Oh, stop. Wes : Actually, Dr. Hudson, if you can do me a favour and move a little bit to the left... Uh, my left, your right. More... That-well, yeah... that's... Jared : (Quietly) He's not even in the frame! Wes : Yeah, that's perfect. Mrs. Blake : (Clears her throat) Edward : Can we take this picture, boys? Wes : Yeah. Two seconds, Sir. Jared : (Clears his throat) Just trying to keep Dr. Feel'em'up here away from the Blake women. As soon as he stops harassing your wife, I'll go ahead and snap the pic. Edward : Aren't you the young man who swam in my pool in his underwear? Wes : (Chuckles) Sir, when you say it like that, it makes it sound like there's something going on between us. I might have to bring you up on harassment charges. Edward : Mr. Malik, when we're done here, a word up in my office. Jared : Uh... y-yes, of course, Sir. Big smile. (Camera shutter clicks) (Car honks, mariachi music plays) Seth : Hey! Uh, so there's two under park-are you...? Okay. London : (Chuckles) Seth : Wow. You look... just hideous. Like really disgusting. London : Thanks, you too. So gross. (Laughs) Mexican, huh? Seth : Yeah, I love fish tacos. You have no idea how many I can pack away. It might scare you off. London : I... I doubt anything could. (Mariachi music plays) It's kinda busy. Seth : Yeah, I can't even get this hostess to talk to me. Hey! Um, so... So what is the wait time on... you seriously can't see... I'm right here. London : So... Donnie. I mean, you guys know each other? Seth : Uh... who? London : My patient with the broken femur. The one you yelled at, then pretended not to know when I walked in? Yeah, uh, Donnie. Um, yeah, he's my step-cousin. London : What? He's been my patient for days! Why would you not tell me that? Seth : Can we not talk about it? London : We can't not talk about it. He's your family. Seth : And I hate talking about them. London : But you know everything about my family and... And you've never mentioned yours, and now one of them is my patient! Seth : So what do we need to do to get a table here? Hey! Do I need to text your iPad or... Okay, this is ridiculous. London : Yeah, it is ridiculous. Why won't you tell me about your cousin? Seth : Step-cousin. Step-cousin. Do you wanna go somewhere quiet and talk? Seth : You know, I'm not feeling that great. Let's just take a rain check. London : Wait, wait, you're leaving? Seth : Uh, I'm sorry, London. (Engine hums) (Phone buzzes) Dylan : Shouldn't you be harassing people on street corners? Teddy : How do you know I'm not? Come on, you should be happy I took a minute to talk to you. Actually, I am. It's been a super-dupe day. Teddy : Yeah, for real. I'm bored off my ass right now. Got me thinking about the good old days though. Thinking about you and me. (Traffic rumbles, crickets chirp) Dylan : Hey, does your dad's alarm company handle the security for uh... metal factory lofts? Teddy : Uh... I dunno, maybe. I can check. Isn't that where I saw you last night? Dylan : Maybe. Teddy : Oh, ho! You smell that? Dylan : What? Teddy : It smells like... A Dylan Blake/Teddy Ralston reunion tour to me! Dylan : Uh, no. Teddy : Hey, look, the codes are yours... Just as long as me and the rest of the crew can tag along. Dylan : I don't know, Teddy... Well, then I don't know if I can give you the codes. Dylan : (Sighs) (Door opens and closes) Teddy : D? Dylan : Never mind. Hey! Stop! Hey, I'm talking to you. Where's my dad? Are you two having an affair?! Is he staying with you in loft 202? Answer me! Go home, Dylan! You can't be here! (Raps seat) Go! Dylan : How do you know me?! (Cab rumbles away) (Panting) (Door bursts open) Dylan : We need to talk. Goodis : You need to knock. Dylan : No time. I caught a break. Goodis : Dylan, I'm working a huge case here. Dead psychiatrist found in an abandoned hospital wing. Maybe you remember it? Dylan : Yeah, and I've been working my own angle. I found the blonde woman from the security tape. Goodis : How? Dylan : In my dad's watch, there was a message for me, and on the back, it was the dead psychiatrist's phone number. I dug around in some old hospital records and found out that Dr. Yan was treating my dad for schizophrenia. Which I'm guessing you already knew. Goodis : It wasn't my place to tell you. But now you know why I didn't wanna close the case. Dylan : My dad was always paranoid that something bad was gonna happen, a symptom of his illness. He used to tell me to always have a place to hide. He drew this over and over again and I found out where it is. This view matches up with a second story loft in a building across the street. And last night I saw the blonde woman in the leopard print coat exit that same building. She called me by my name before she took off. Goodis : It's not enough to reopen the case. But you believe me, right? You can look into the loft. I can't just kick the door down. All right, unofficially... If you figure anything else out, let me know. Dylan : Thank you. Goodis : Huh. 
 
 (Door opens) (Nervous exhale, phone rings nearby) Jared : (Sighs heavily) Wes : What happened? Dude! Jared : I tried. I really did. But you only get called up to Edward Blake's office for bad news. You're gone. (Phone rings in the hall) Wes : They fired me? Jared : It's a volunteer position, they can't really "fire" you. But you aren't allowed to be here anymore. Wes : No. No, no, no, no, no. I nee-I need, I need this gig. This is supposed to get me scholarships, reference letters. You know I'll write you one. Not from you, moron! (Exhales sharply) How do I fix this? You could fall on your sword. A sincere apology is your only hope. And don't make any jokes. Page over hospital PA : Dr. Card, OR 2. Dr. Card, OR 2. Donnie : Go fish. London : Oh! What-what's happening here? Donnie : Somebody called my family. Everybody out! Go! London : (Awkwardly) H-hi. Hi. Uh, Wa... was that somebody your step-cousin Seth? Donnie : He told you? Of course, it was Sethy! Guy's a sweetheart, honestly, but what a thick-nog, you know? London : You and Seth don't seem... Related. Donnie : Well... Seth's mom married my Uncle when he was about thirteen. I always looked up to him. Brainy. Like you. So tell me, Doc, what are the results? London : You have a staph infection. Look, I really gotta get outta here. Well, if I discharge you and you have an issue, you could lose your leg. Donnie : I don't think you understand, okay? I can't be here anymore. London : Why? Scarlet : Dr. Blake? A word? Now. Right... right now. You see the cute guy with his collar popped? The one with the goatee? London : Mm-hmm. Scarlet : That's Iggy Mara. I dated him for two weeks last year. Two weeks before I realized... This was his family. What, Donnie's a Mara?! And that means he's in the mob. London : And that means... Seth is, too. Scarlet : What?! Who was talking about Seth? (Sighs heavily) Dylan : All right, look, you and the guys can tag along. Just gotta make sure I don't get caught breaking probation. Teddy : You wanna tell me why you want in this loft so bad? Dylan : Since when does why we're breaking into a place matter? At least we'll be together, right? Teddy : Good point. All right, I'll pick you up when you're done being a goody-good, finger painting whatever... (phone thuds) Richard : So Agent Sheppard hadn't... He hadn't been to Kiev. Like, I mean, he had seen it, right? He'd seen it. But only in... like, just in uh... just in, in pictures  or a... on travel sites. That's-that's it. My contact is late. My contact is late. Dylan : Well, I'm in! Richard : (Laughs) Dylan: That's for your novel, right? Richard : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. (Dylan's phone buzzes) Richard : Can I see this for... Dylan : Uh, hey, dad! Richard: No, just I wanna see, okay? I just wanna see who is so enthralling that my daughter cannot detach herself from this phone. Teddy. Teddy : "Wassup, yo?" He sounds like an idiot. Dylan : Well, he's not. Richard : He's not? Is this a boyfriend? Dylan : No, no, we just met! He's in my math class. Can I have my phone back, please? Richard : I'm sorr... look, I-I-I just... I just wanna make sure you surround yourself with good people, okay? Not people who are gonna lead you down a dark path. Dylan : I'm not one of your characters, remember? Richard : No. Dylan : Besides, nobody leads me anywhere I don't wanna go. Richard : I'm counting on that. You are not supposed to be talking to those people. Dylan : I can't stop them from calling my phone. (Phone rings nearby, people chatter) What happens to you and Dr. K when dad comes back? Jane : I want him to come back, I really do. I want that for you. I want it for the family. People grow apart sometimes. Dylan : You'll get a divorce? Jane : I don't know. I guess. I love Dominic. I know that's hard to hear. I... Dylan. Dylan! (Gasps, exhales sharply) (Elevator dings, doors rumble open) Wes : Excuse me, um, (Clears throat) Dr. Blake. Ten, please. Was Jared not clear about my instructions? Yeah. If only I could explain. Edward : You made inappropriate remarks in front of important people. Yes, and I-I sincerely apologize for that. If-if you allow me to keep my volunteer position, I won't ever talk again. (Elevator dings) (Doors rumble open) You and my Dylan... Are friends? Wes : Uh, yes, Sir, we are. Edward : Dr. Hudson? Wes : No, we are not friends. Ah. I recognize teenage drama when I see it. Whomever it's about, it doesn't matter, you can't speak to people like that. All right, but having Open Heart Memorial on my resume is very important to me. I-I've wanted to be a doctor ever since I was a kid. Edward : And Med School is a long way off. So what's the real answer? Why do you wanna be here right now? Wes : I lost my parents when I was five years old. Now, being here, helping people, makes me feel like I am doing something useful, and that I could stop someone else from feeling the way that I felt when my parents died. You know, if being a doctor is your calling, you will need to make better choices going forward. Wes : Going forward? (Elevator dings) Doe1s that mean... ? Edward : You have a second chance, Mr. Silver. Boys let others goad them into talking before thinking. Men get their brains ahead of their mouths. Thank you for the second chance. Value it. I don't give third chances. (Exhales, relieved) London : Fish tacos. I-I got as many as would fit in the container. That's sweet. Thanks. London : Why didn't you tell me your family is... who they are? Seth : A bunch of thugs? London : They seem nice. Yeah, the maras are not nice. Well, they have nice jackets. Seth : Yeah, ones that fell off the back of a truck. Truth is, I'm ashamed of them. Really? I could hardly tell. Seth : So you wanna break up? London : Of course not. If anyone understands family drama, it's me. Seth : Family drama? Is your Uncle in jail for bribing a judge? London : No... but your family is not you. Seth : I'm sorry I ruined our date. You know, having them here, in my space, it's... it's making me crazy. London : Okay, well, how can I help? Seth : Discharge Donnie. London : What? He has a bacterial infection! Seth : It's dangerous for him to be here. London : Come on! Seth: How did Donnie say he broke his leg? London : He tripped. Seth : Onto a hammer? You think someone broke his leg on purpose? The lockdown the other day... someone said they spotted a guy with a gun. This is shortly after a member of my notoriously crappy family is admitted here with a mysterious injury. What do you think that's about? London : Yeah, well, that stuff only happens in movies. Seth : This is real life. My real life. Look, discharge Donnie. If he goes, the maras go with him. Please? (Low hum of chatter) Man, I hate fighting with you. Both : (Chuckle) Me too. I kissed Hud on the cheek. As a thank you for helping, mostly. Huh. (Clear throat) Okay. He wasn't happy about it, if that makes you feel any better. No, no, it-it doesn't. I don't get it, he's so old. He's not that old, but point taken. Look, it's nothing. I don't... I don't even know why I did it. It's just... over. Can we please be cool again? Well, I guess he is, you know, kinda handsome. Like an old handsome... Stop. Why were you crying? Um... Every morning, when I wake up I expect to hear my dad banging around the kitchen, and making breakfast. And for a tiny second, before I'm fully awake, I forget. And then, I remember... Every morning. Until I find him, nothing's gonna be right. I'm never gonna be right. Then I guess we should find him. Okay? And we'll... we'll stake out that loft. Good-cop, cute-cop, remember? Thanks, but staking out the loft isn't gonna work. I have to break in. London : Hey, Donnie! Donnie! Just so you know, I've discharged you against my better judgment. My professional recommendation is for you to remain in-hospital. Donnie : Not a good idea. London : Yeah, I know. Donnie : You know what? You're a good match for Sethy. I can see it. London : Okay. Well, take all of these. If the infection spreads, get back here immediately. Donnie : Will do. Thanks. It's nice to have a doctor in the family. (Doors rumble shut) Mikayla : You could go to jail. Hanging out with Teddy and Rayna violates your probation. Not to mention the whole breaking and entering part. Wes : You said Goodis was on it. Dylan : His hands are tied until I can get proof that my dad's connected to that place. Mikayla : I seriously doubt a Detective wants you to commit a crime. Wes : Yeah, Goodis has a serious problem if he's encouraging you to do this. Dylan : He's not encouraging me, okay? I saw the blonde woman coming out of that building. Teddy has the entry codes. All we gotta do is walk through the door. Wes : Then we're coming with you. Mikayla : We are? Dylan : No, you're not. Mikayla : What if you get caught, Dylan? (Car rumbles to a stop) Dylan : I don't plan on getting caught. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
