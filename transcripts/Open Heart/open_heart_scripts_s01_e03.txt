 (Light buzzes as it flickers) 
 This is the weirdest initiation ever. 
 Wes : Sounds like you can't handle it. 
 Dylan : I can handle it. I can handle it. 
 (Distant bang) 
 Mikayla : We can't be down here! We gotta go! 
 Wes : No time! We'll come back for you! 
 Dylan : Wait! No! Wesley! Ugh! 
 (Footsteps outside) 
 Scarlet : This is what you came up with? The morgue. Hud : Well, your text sounded desperate. So many exclamation marks. (Kissing) Scarlet : Mm... why do I put up with you? Hud : Because we just worked eighteen hours and we've got another twelve to go. Scarlet : You gotta get through it somehow... Hud : Mm-hmm. (Kissing) ♪ (Distant bang) (Drawer door creaks open) (Drawer rumbles open) Hud : That's funny... You don't look dead. Dylan : I was just... Hud : Spying? Dylan : Um, napping... Big napper. You know volunteers, they're not allowed down here. But it's cool for residents to come down here and hook up? (Drawer door clicks shut) (Small laugh) You're London's little sister, aren't you? Dylan : Are you gonna tell on me? Hud : Look... You didn't see me, and I didn't see you. Sound good? Dylan : Mm-hmm. Good. (Receding footsteps) Wes : I swear we were coming back for you. Dylan : Sure, sure. You're just lucky I got away clean, after listening to two residents suck face for a while. Mikayla : Oh, do you still think he has your dad's watch? Dylan : Well, if he does, I have to get it back. Wes : Because there's a message for you Dylan : Okay, I'm aware it sounds nuts,  but my dad did that kind of thing all the time. He put word puzzles in my lunchboxes,  and origami notes in my snow boots. Okay, so... operation get watch back. Dylan : Okay. Step one, talk to Dr. Hudson again. Wes : Again? You... uh, you talked to him down there? Why... w-why didn't you just ask him about the watch then? Well, I tried I did try - but he was looking at me, so... Oh, I would not be able to talk to him if he was looking at me. I mean, those piercing blue eyes  and you can see his muscles through his lab coat! Wes : Okay, we got it, Mikayla. Thanks. Dylan : You know, I just wasn't on my game,  and next time I will be. I just need a reason to talk to him. Well, good luck finding one. Guy's as boring as a phone book. Hud is not boring. He was a soldier! Easy he was an army medic. He wasn't driving a tank. (Sighs) Okay. What's the plan? Hang out in the morgue until Hud's next booty call? Jared : Did I interrupt "Cool Kids Club"? Yes. And don't call it that. Jared : All right. Maybe the three of you need to be separated today. Mikayla, you're on flower delivery. Wes, some seniors in geriatrics need a fourth for cards, and uh... Dylan... Dylan : I could... restock the pamphlet dispensers. Jared : Nobody likes doing that. Dylan : Guess I'm a weirdo! Fine. Whatever. Dylan : I now have complete freedom to follow Dr. Hudson wherever he goes, and, you know, accidentally... on-purpose talk to him. Wes : Oh, super. (Unlocking clicks) (Heartbeat pulses) Sherri : I read about toxoplasmosis online and I'm worried I have it. Is there a test for that? Sherri, the baby's heart rate is fine. There are no contractions. I think you're okay. What about my back? Like my back hurts. You're thirty-two weeks along, and kind of big. (Inaudible page over hospital PA system) I'm saying my back would hurt, too. Something is seriously wrong with my baby. Look, I can't admit you. You can if you do a test for toxoplasmosis. London : Based on your lack of symptoms... Sherri : I'm not going anywhere. 'Kay, I'll get a nurse. Scarlet : You know runner's high? Do you think there's a doctor's high? Because I feel... (Sings) High! London : How are you so awake right now? I feel like I'm underwater. Scarlet : Don't you nap on your one-hours? London : Yes, but I still don't look like a flawless mermaid. So... how? Explain. Scarlet : It's called stress management. I make time for fun. Oh, just say it so I don't have to. Hud and I are kind of a thing! London : Gross. Scarlet : It's casual. For fun. You've heard of fun, right, London? Maybe you wouldn't be such a stress-case if you found a boy of your own. I'm at this hospital all the time. Where am I supposed to meet a boy? Scarlet : Duh. (Low hum of chatter, elevator dings) (Locker clicks open) (Approaching footsteps) (Shirt rustles) (Inaudible page over hospital PA) Hi! Hud : How long have you been there? I'm sor... I'm sorry! Uh, I'm... I was just... I didn't... realize this was... What is this place? It's the residents lounge. Right. Uh, I guess you guys don't need pamphlets on... Hepatitis. No, we're good. Yeah. You and your sister... (Grunts) You guys are pretty different, huh? Yeah, everyone... everyone says she's like my mom and I'm like my dad. Or I was, before he disappeared on us. Hud : Yeah, that sucks. Did you ever meet him? My dad? Hud : No, not really. Dylan : But you saw him here that last day. You talked to him and he gave you his watch. Yeah, he did. But look, that... That was weeks before the cops questioned me about that. By that time, I'd already given it back. Given it back to who? Your mom. Jane : Hi. One coffee please. (Cash register beeps) Thank you. Dr. K : Make it two on me. I can't buy my colleague a coffee once in a while? Jane : Not with that goofy grin on your face. Dr. K : Can I help it? Come on, nobody is going to notice. Jane : Dylan will notice. Dr. K : London sees us every day and she doesn't suspect a thing. Jane : Because London reads textbooks and patient charts, and Dylan reads people. It's different. Dr. K : Is this where you tell me we have to cool it until she's done serving her sentence? Jane : No. This is where I tell you we need to tell the girls about us. What do you think about that? Are you sure? Jane : Richard's case is closed, and... I wanna move on. I don't wanna keep you a secret from the girls anymore. Dr. K and Jane : (Laugh) Dr. K : Okay. Jane : Okay. (Chuckles happily) (Low hum of chatter) London : Here. Uh, I need a full panel, including a PT... (phone buzzes) Ugh! Lunch with my mother?! And PTT. ASAP. That's the last thing that I wanna do. Seth : Only half of that was directed at me, right? London : Huh? Seth: The test half? London : What? Yes. Seth : O-Kay, prickly lady... Seth : (Sighs heavily) London : Sorry. Seth : Hey, just hang out for a bit. Chill. (Sighs) London : Wait. You're a boy! Yeah... that's true. You're right, I need to chill. I should hang out here. You know, maybe... Maybe we should have lunch together? Seth : Well, what about lunch with your mom? London : Oh, that'll add to my stress, not manage it. I'd rather spend time with you. What do you think? Uh... I'd-I'd be an idiot to say no. You would. So it's a date? (Seth chuckles) Fun! (Big band style music plays) Wes : 'Kay... clubs for my partner. Elderly lady patient : Uh-oh. Male patient : All right. (Big band style music plays) 
♪ Open up the door is what I say... ♪ (Chair scrapes forward, Dylan clears her throat) So... Hud told me what he did with the watch. Perfect. Now you don't ever have to speak to that dud again. You know, he is interesting. He has all these scars on his back. I wonder if something happened to him when he was in the army. How did you see his back exactly? I was talking to him in the residents lounge and... He was changing his shirt. It was dirty! (Flustered sounds) This whole thing's dirty. (Frustrated sigh) Would you focus, Wes! Hud gave my dad's watch to my mom. Why is she hiding it from me? Um, she probably didn't think it meant anything. 
 
 (Dylan's phone buzzes, chair scrapes back) Wes : Is that... okay, what's trump up here? Dylan : Hello? London : Hey. Did you see that text from mom about lunch? Dylan : Yes. Almost immediately, as you usually do with texts. Anyway, um... I can't make it. Dylan : No, no, no. You have to come, you're the buffer! London : Buff yourself. (Phone beeps off) Dylan : Great. Lunch alone with my mom. Wes : Well, sounds like a good opportunity to talk to her one-on-one. Dylan : One-on-one always turns into a fight. And I can't just straight up ask her for the watch. Gonna have to be nice. Elderly lady patient : Catch more flies with honey, honey. ♪ Kissin' all your troubles and your cares away ♪ London : Shouldn't be much longer for the lab results. About as long as it takes Toto eat lunch. Okay, bye. Sherri : Yeah, I've been googling my symptoms and I might be off with toxoplasmosis. Does my skin look blotchy? London : No more self-diagnosing off the Internet. The tests will tell us nothing's wrong. Sherri : Or something is wrong. Why are you in such a hurry? Listen. I have one hour a day to find balance in my life, so I'm begging you, please let me go. (Sighs heavily) Fine. London : Thank you. (Dishes and cutlery clatter, low hum of chatter) (Tray thumps, Jane sighs) Jane : It's too bad London couldn't join us. What is this? You know, I used to get these in my coat pockets all the time. Love notes. Dylan : Gross. Jane : Sorry. I didn't know he taught you how to make them. Don't you miss him? I didn't ask you here to talk about your father. I can't just forget about him. Jane : I am not asking you to. Um... you know what? Why don't we talk about something else? I won't forget he existed just to make you feel better. Obviously, this lunch was a mistake. (Chair scrapes back) Yeah. (Receding footsteps) London : The theoretical stuff, all that was a breeze for me. Why? Because once I see something, I remember it forever. Forever? Okay, um... What was I wearing two Mondays ago? A black t-shirt with a Silver guy on a surfboard. Silver surfer. But I wear that shirt a lot, so good guess. London : You also had a red and yellow plaid shirt overtop, and then your lab coat, of course. Seth : Of course. London : And the shoelace on your left high-top was untied. I kept thinking you were gonna trip, and then you did, but it was over the bankers box that was left on the floor. Not your shoelace. You are paying a lot of attention to me, Dr. Blake. London : Don't feel special. I have a photographic memory. Can I feel a little bit special? Okay, a little bit. ♪ (Phone buzzes) Oh no... (Running footsteps) (Door shuts) (Door bursts open, Sherri groans in pain. April : Fetal heart rate is falling. London : What's happening? Dr. K : She's hemorrhaging. London : PT was 12. PTT was 34. That's normal. She should be fine. Dr. K : You ran thromboplastin tests? London : It was a guess. She had a sharp localized pain in her back. Dr. K : How long? London : Twenty-four hours. Sherri : (Groans in pain) Dr. K : Sounds like hidden uterine bleeding. We'll have to section the baby. Sherri : What? No, it's too early! (Panting) (Weakly) I told you something was wrong! (Sherri groans) (Shaky breaths) (Phone rings nearby, people chatter) Dylan : Hey! Hud : Hey. God, you're like a mosquito. Cold-blooded and deadly? Hud : No, annoying and buzzing all over me. Get your watch back? Dylan : Not yet. Hey, look, I need to know exactly what my dad was like that day. Did he say anything specific? What was his mood? Upset, angry, happy? Hud : Look, I told the police everything all right? Haven't you ever lost someone? God, you're relentless. Doesn't it bother you how everyone just goes on with their daily lives like those people never existed? Look. Your dad was upset. Okay, he seemed... He seemed desperate. When he gave me the watch, he said, "make sure she gets this." I thought he meant your mom or... London. Dylan : Maybe he meant me. Hud : Yeah. Dylan : (Crying) Hud : Hey, come on, it's gonna be okay. Jared : Uh, what's happening here? Hud : (Annoyed sigh) Dylan : Nothing, Jared. Looks inappropriate if you ask me. Hud : Yeah? Well, nobody asked you. Look, you know everything I know now, okay? Dylan : Yeah. Jared : Okay, crocodile tears. Here's a little lesson about hospital hierarchy, all right? It goes nurses, doctors, residents, patients, and then way, way, way below... visitors, then volunteers. Just because you're a Blake, doesn't change that. Jane : Is there a problem here? Jared : No. No problem, Dr. Blake. Jane : Really? Then why are you lecturing my daughter to tears? Jared : I wasn't! She was crying about something to Dr. Hudson. Dylan : Shut. Up. Jared : I'm just saying what I saw. Jane : Doesn't sound like you saw anything, Mr. Malik, so why don't you go do your job? Dylan, my office. (Receding footsteps) The police have decided to end their investigation. But we still don't know what happened to dad. Get caught up with full episodes at open-heart.com. I need some help. Jane : You remember why you're volulunteering here, right? Because you're on probation. And that means I can't talk to people? No. Jared is your supervisor, okay? He makes the rules. You need to follow them. So, if he says, "don't talk to the residents," don't talk to them! Why were you crying? Hud was the last person to talk to dad. Jane : Dylan... Dylan : Hud said that dad gave him his watch. You know, the one I gave to him for Christmas a few years ago. Hud gave it to you. Jane : Yeah, he did. I guess um... I forgot. Dylan : Forgot? How could you forget?! Dad leaving this behind... it means something! (Drawer closes) Jane : I agree. It means goodbye. Sweetie, I don't wanna cause you any more pain, but I don't know how to help you get over this. (Door opens and bangs shut) (Exhales sharply) London : (Gasps) Oh! Seth : Oh! Seth : Sorry. Sorry. Uh... London : (Sharp exhale) Seth: Don't you guys have sleep rooms? (Gasping for breath) I was... I was waiting for you. Seth : Oh. Hey, uh... How's your patient? London : They had to emergency section her baby,  but both are doing fine. No thanks to idiot me, who sacrificed the health of a woman and her unborn child to hook up with a boy. London : You! Seth : We ate sandwiches. London : You know what I mean, okay? I'm a horrible doctor, and... human person. Seth : Hey, everything turned out fine. Even if you'd stayed with her, she still would've needed surgery. And last time I checked, you can't do those yet, right? London : (Sighs) Thanks. You're a sweet guy, Seth. (Sighs) And here comes the but... But I can't do the relationship thing right now, or even the casual datey thing. I need to focus on my work. But... can we stay friendly professionals? Can you please not hate me? I would never hate you. And I'm happy to stay friendly professionals. (Sighs) (Kissing) London : Oh! Seth : (Shaky sigh) We might have different definitions of "friendly professionals." London : I'm sorry. (Shaky sigh) Oh my God... Oh my God... ♪ I'm turning myself in ♪ 
♪ I've been a jealous friend ♪ 
♪ feels like I'm always sinking... ♪ 
♪ Oh, oh... ♪ 
♪ Just like you used to say... ♪ I didn't tell them. I knew you wouldn't. Why? 'Cause I'm scared? Because you're a good mother. And you know Dylan is still fragile, and... We don't need to make this about us right now. Thank you. (Elevator dings, doors slide open) Going my way? Not tonight, Dom. (Doors slide closed) (Keyboard keys clack) Dylan : (Sighs) Wes : Hey. Oh, wow! Okay. So? (Claps hands) So we finally get to see what's inside? Dylan : Mm-hmm. Wes : Are you gonna open it? Dylan : What if it's empty? What if everything is for nothing? Wes : You won't know until you open it. So go on, open it. Please, open it! Dylan : Okay. (Face clicks) Okay... (Face clicks shut) (Paper rustles) I love you... Well, that's a good message to get. I was hoping it'd be a clue to where he was staying or why? Well, I mean, he just wants you to know that he loves you. He's still gone. Well, I mean, I wish my parents had time to leave me a message like that. Dylan : Time? Wes: Yeah. I was five, so... I don't really remember much about the car accident. My Uncle's been taking care of me ever since. I mean... it's not like I... Walk around with 'orphan' plastered on my forehead... Although I do have a t-shirt. Dylan : That's not funny. Wes : You'll think about it later and realize that it is. (Door opens) Mikayla : Hey... any luck on the watch? Dylan : It's a dead end. Maybe Richard Blake doesn't wanna be found. I am going home. I'll see you guys later. (Paper rustles) Mikayla : W-w-w-wait! What's this on the back?
