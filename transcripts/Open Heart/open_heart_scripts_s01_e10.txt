 (Flyer rustles, low hum of chatter) 
 Mikayla : Okay, you are here and that's the cafe. 
 Oh, no, no, wait, that's the elevator... 
 Jared : Press the "up" button. When the doors open, you get in. 
 Press the number six... (Doors slide closed) 
 And oh! Shoot. 
 Wes : So you're gonna see a sign that says "pediatrics." 
 That's a decoy. The real pediatrics is on the tenth floor. 
 I'm kidding. (Chuckles) 
 Dylan : Have you seen this woman? Her name's Veronica Rykov. 
 She was with my dad when he went missing, and she was last seen here at this hospital. 
 If you have any information, my cell number's on there, and there's a reward for any tips leading to her whereabouts or my dad's recovery, and if you post the flyer on pager, I'd really appreciate it. 
 Wes : Okay, she's harmless - we love her, we love her. 
 Are you okay? You're getting a little intense with the flyers. 
 Yeah, that's kinda the point of going public with them. 
 No, I know. But they're all over the city, all over the hospital, all over pager. 
 I mean, maybe dial it back a little, give 'em some time to work. 
 Dylan : Dialing it back isn't really my thing. 
 Wes : Well, what about dinner? Is dinner your thing? 
 Look, I just feel... 
 I feel like you could take a little bit of a break from obsessing and think up a cool new restaurant you've been wanting to check out. 
 Dinner at a cool restaurant and then, what? 
 Dessert back at your place? 
 Wes : Well, no. I was thinking like an all-you-can-eat thing and dessert's included in that, so... 
 Oh! No! Yeah. 
 Definitely dessert back at my place. 
 Yes. I understand. That's my plan. 
 We... We are on the same page. 
 Dylan : Are we? 
 Wes : The flyers are gonna work. 
 You're gonna find Veronica, and you're gonna find your dad. 
 You just need to give it some time. 
 Dylan : Okay. 
 Wes : Okay. 
 (Kiss) 
 I'll see you later. 
 Okay. 
 (Phone buzzes) 
 Hello? 
 Woman : Is this who I talk to about the reward money? 
 Dylan : Uh, yeah. 
 Woman : Good. 
 'Cause I've seen that woman. 
 (Unlocking click) 
 (Heartbeat pulses) 
 The caffeine does nothing. 
 I've built up a tolerance. I'm immune. 
 Yeah... welcome to my nightmare. 
 This place needs to start selling adrenaline shots. 
 Hypodermic needles straight to the heart. 
 I'd pay so much money for that. 
 Hud : Ugh! My day is gonna suck! 
 (Heavy landing thud) 
 Scarlet : Stuck in the ER again, huh? 
 Hud : Ugh! Why do I always get hammered with the pukers and hypochondriacs? 
 I'd trade you my inappropriate-firefighter prepping-for-pacemaker, but I don't want the ER. 
 London : Wait. I'll take the ER. 
 Hud : Yeah. Right. Nice try, London. 
 Your roster's full of hemophiliacs. 
 Scarlet : Ooh! I'd take the bleeders. 
 London : No, no. I don't... there's no way I'm getting stuck with the city's rudest. 
 Hud : No, no, no, no, no. This is a... 
 It's a three-way deal. 
 Scarlet gets the bleeders. I'll take the firefighter. 
 You get the ER. 
 Wait, this isn't gonna stress you into a vision, is it? 
 I'm fine. I like the er. 
 She's fine. She likes the ER. 
 Hud : All right then. Well... welcome to the suck. 
 (Knock at the door) 
 Jane : Come in. 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 Dr. K : Did you know about this? 
 Jane : I did. 
 And you're okay with it? 
 Yeah, I think it's a... Constructive outlet, and it's better than breaking into houses. 
 And who knows? 
 She might actually find Richard. 
 What? 
 Am I losing you, Jane? 
 (Knock at the door) 
 (Door opens) 
 Goodis : Oh, sorry to interrupt. Uh...  (Closes door) Dr. Blake, may I have a moment? Jane : Yeah. Something's come up and I wanted to run it by you. It's actually about Dr. Ellen Yan. Richard's dead psychiatrist. It's looking like a crime of passion. Not premeditated. Something personal. There was an argument, then an accident. We have a lot of leads right now, including Yan's ex-husband. But I have an unconventional idea. Jane : 'Kay. Goodis : I'd like to throw Richard into the mix. Dr. K : You mean as a suspect? Goodis : I know it's an extreme move, but they'll pour a lot of resources into trying to find a suspect. My husband is not a murderer! I-I-I know. I would... I would clear him. Jane : What is this? What kind of cop... Dylan said you were helping her! This could reopen the case, we could-we could find him. I'm not gonna let you turn him into a murder suspect to find him. Well... actually, I... I don't need your permission. I was hoping for your support. Get the hell out of my office! Dr. K : Jane. (Shocked) I came here as a friend. Back off, Detective. (Exhales, shocked) (Low hum of chatter, phone rings in the distance) Hud : All right, Terminator. Let's get you prepped for your new robot heart. Justin : What's this? What's this? Where'd the cutie go? Hud : Dr. McWhinnie is doing rounds. She traded you to me for an extra lunch break and patients to be named later. You got fleeced. I don't think she loved being referred to as Dr. Hottie. Justin : Come on, man. I was just trying to make her laugh. (Laughs) So sensitive. You nervous? Justin : Nervous? Nah. Heart surgery, man, I got this. I'm good, I'm good. Hey, this is day surgery. You fight fires. You're gonna get through this. What do you know about it? I know about it. You been over there? Yeah. Different kind of fire fight. You got through it okay? Hud : I got through it. My commanding officer, he said I needed a constant. Somebody to hold on to, to help pull me through  to the other side of all the scary stuff. You know, I thought it was this bogus thing, but...  Justin : What if you don't have anybody? You got me. Nah. Gonna use Dr. Hottie. Justin and Hud : (Laugh) Hud : I don't think she'd like that. Justin : So what you gonna do? You gonna run and go tell her now? Hud and Justin : (Laughing) I'll see you when you get out. Do you have one? Hud : What? Justin : A constant. You have one? I used to have the guys in my unit. Used to? Hud : That's enough bonding for today, I think. Justin : Ah, come on, man. I'm sorry, buddy, I didn't mean it. Listen... Don't worry about it. I'll be watching from the window. (Curtain scrapes across) (Machinery rumbles nearby) Dylan : You Taylor? Taylor : Maybe. How about now? Tell me about Veronica. I don't know who Veronica is, but I've seen that chick around. She's got blonde hair, blue eyes. Nice cheekbones and stuff. Dylan : Are you kidding me? All that stuff's on the poster. I need real info. Have you seen her or not? Taylor : If you wanna know that, it's gonna cost you more than twenty bucks. Taylor : That's it? Dylan : Yeah, unless you've got a chip reader, that's it. So spill it. (Phone buzzes) What?! No! Hey! (Footsteps thud) Dylan : Hey! Taylor : (Gasping for air, coughing) I can't breathe. Yeah, karma's a bootch! Now give me my info or give me the money back. Taylor : No. I really don't feel well. Dylan : Nice try. I know what crying wolf looks like. (Coughing and gagging) Whoa! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! I'm gonna get you some help, okay? Dylan : This girl needs help! London! London : What happened? Dylan : She-she coughed up blood and passed out. London : 'Kay, could be acute bronchitis. Could be TB. Let's make sure it's not congestive heart failure or a pulmonary embolism. What's her name? Dylan : Taylor. Wes : Hey, what's going on, are you okay? Dylan : Yeah, that girl called, said she had a tip about Veronica, but she stole my money and then took off running, and she coughed up blood and I had to chase her and it was just-it was a whole thing. Um... I'm sorry, I just - I gotta see what's going on. Okay, if you wanna reschedule dinner... No, I don't wanna do that. Dinner's happening. London : Dylan, let's go. We're taking her to radiology. I need you to tell me everything that happened. I gotta go, but dinner's happening. Okay, the more you say that, the less I feel like it's true. Dylan : Dinner is happening! 
 
 (ER buzzes with chatter) (Locker clicks shut) Hud : (Breathing hard) (Chair crashes) Hud : Hey! Did you know?! I swear, if you knew, you better tell me 'cause I am not screwing around here! Scarlet : What're you talking about?! Hud : Justin! The firefighter! The guy you... you wanted to trade me! Did you know that he had right ventricular dysplasia? How could I have possibly known that? Well, you wanted to trade him pretty damn bad! Because he was being rude! Why are you yelling at me? Because he died, Scarlet! He's dead! His heart... (Exhales) Just... (Hits locker forcefully) It was just... it was day surgery! (Exhales shakily) Scarlet : Hud... It will get easier. People die here every day. (Pager buzzes) Scarlet : The ER's getting crushed. Hud? Hello! 911! Come on. (Receding footsteps, Hud blows out his breath) (ER buzzes with chatter, siren wails outside) Dr. K : Driver lost control, had a head-on with an oncoming. Injuries are life-threatening. Dr. McWhinnie, take the driver. Dr. Hudson the passenger. Scarlet : I'm Dr. McWhinnie. You're in the hospital. Can you tell me your name? Dr. K : Hud! The passenger... Hud : Uh, sorry. Dr. K : We need to stabilize for or. Where's Dr. Blake?! London : I'm here! Okay, there's possible internal bleeding and his bones are unstable. (Er buzzes with chatter and activity) You're shaking. Are you okay? Okay, we need to intubate. Let's up his painkillers! No more morphine. Ketamine. 50 milligrams. Hey, no. Half that dose, half that dose! I don't want him going into cardiac arrest. Hud! Hey! Hud! Come on, this guy needs you here right now. I need you. Tell me you're okay. I am. Yeah, I... I am now. London : (Sighs with relief) Okay. (Machines hiss and beep) (Remote clicks, bed buzzes) What's going on? Dylan : Turns out you've got a bad case of viral pneumonia and a collapsed lung. You're lucky I was there, Taylor. Really? Nothing you wanna say? No "thank you"? No "sorry"? (Sighs heavily) Okay, look. I get it. You're doing what you need to to survive, and I'm doing the same thing. Probably at the cost of my boyfriend... So if you know anything about that blonde woman, Veronica, could you please just tell me? I seen her at that diner sometimes. What diner? Doug's East. Thank you. Taylor : Am I really that sick? I don't wanna be stuck at this stupid hospital. Am I gonna make it or what? You'll make it. I promise. (Hub buzzes with chatter) Goodis : (Angrily) Hey, doc! I was the one person helping you out, and this is the thanks I get? This is what you do? Jane : I have no idea what you're talking... Goodis : My murder case was ripped away from me. I've been strapped to a desk with an official complaint on my record for harassing the Blake family! Jane : I had nothing to do with that. Goodis : Oh! You're all the same, you know that? You just use your money and your name to tip the scales whichever way you need them to lean. You make me sick! Did you really come here to yell at me, Detective? You cost me my career! Why? Is it 'cause I got too close to the truth? Jane : I'm walking away now, detective Goodis. If you ever come back here, I will make sure that harassment complaint turns into a charge. (Receding footsteps) (Low hum of chatter resumes) Dr. K : Thanks for taking care of it. Wouldn't have had to if you hadn't screwed up with Dr. Yan, Dominic. That was an accident. Lower your voice. Richard told her everything... And now Dylan is making things worse. Dr. K : Now Jane's on board with her and Dylan doesn't exactly talk to me. I don't have an in there. I'll find somebody else. (Elevator dings, receding footsteps) Wes : Hey! Hey! Dylan : Hey. (Kiss) Wes : Where to? Dylan: Um, there's this really cool place I've been wanting to try out. Wes : So this is the really cool place you've been wanting to try? Dylan : I've been hearing great things about Doug's east for years. Wes : Yeah, like, hundreds of years. Dylan : You have no sense of adventure. Are you kidding? I love television shows about adventures. (Laughs) So what did Taylor have to say? Oh, um... nothing really. She was uh... she was pretty out of it. Wes : Oh, that's too bad. It was kinda crazy how it worked out though, right? I mean, if she hadn't tried to roll you, she might not have gotten the help she needed, and I hate to think that... (Door bell jingles, door closes) Okay. Uh, you're looking at that door like you're cheating at cards in the old west. You're a million miles away. What's going on? Taylor said she saw Veronica here. (Sighs) Really? When? Just in general. So you lied to me twice. Dylan : I'm sorry. I... I wanted to do both things and I didn't think you would come. Of course I would come. But didn't you wanna do something kinda normal? Wes : Yeah, for you, not for me. Look, I'm not gonna not help you, but I don't want you lying to me. I'm sorry. I messed up today. Wes : Um... (Sighs heavily) Well, you know, we're here now... And usually places like this have pretty sick milkshakes, so... what do you think? Do you wanna split a milkshake? Now, look, I'm gonna warn you up front, I'm... pretty classic when it comes to flavours, so don't try adding blue raspberry swirl or anything crazy like... Dylan, do you want a milkshake? Dylan : Yeah, no kidding. Wes : I'm gonna go. Dylan : No, Wes, no. I'm sorry. I know I'm distracted. I just, I don't wanna miss anything. Wes : Look, it's fine. It's fine. I'm not mad. But let's not pretend this is a date. We'll talk later, okay? (Rock music plays in diner, people chatter quietly) Mikayla : What? Why didn't you go after him? Dylan : I couldn't. I mean, I wanted to stop him, but I just I kept thinking that I had to stay here Mikayla : Dyl, that's-I mean the odds of that happening are... Dylan : I know, I know, I've been crazy today. Mikayla : Okay, all right, okay. Um, you need to apologize, and you need to bring him a big piece of apology pie asap. Dylan : Okay. Hey, hey, can I get the apple pie to go... like the whole thing, all of it? (Sighs) Dyl, I know you wanna find your dad, but this is your life. You need to find a way to hang on to the people you have. Dylan : I know. I'm just... I'm on my way there now. Just text me the address, please. Okay. (Diners chatter quietly, cutlery clinks) (Paper rustles) Server : Leopard coat... she's missing? Dylan : You know her? Server : Yeah, she was in here earlier. Got a little heated between her and some guy. Um... was this the guy? Server : Don't know. Don't think so, but I didn't get a good look. He was tall, and he wore a suit. (Sighs heavily) That could be anybody. (Door clicks open) Dylan : Uh... hi. Does Wes live here? Uncle Nick : Hey, Wes! Door! I'm going to work! (Receding footsteps, crickets chirp) Dylan : Hi. (Car door shuts, engine starts) I have pie. Dylan : Mikayla said that... Wes : Trying to buy my love, huh? Dylan : Look, I'm... I know that you wanna be this normal couple, but uh... but I can't. I mean, I'm not normal. My life is super not-normal, and I just... I don't wanna lose you. Come here. You're not losing me, okay? And I don't wanna be normal, I wanna be... together. This thing you're doing - trying to find your dad - it's brave. I feel like I'm running in circles. Okay, let's go back to the diner. We can wait there all night. All year if you want. You wanna go? Dylan : No. (Kissing, door slams shut) (Alcohol sloshes in Mickey, low hum of chatter nearby) Hey. Sorry about your firefighter. Go away, London. London : Do you wanna talk about it? Hud : No. I wanna drink about it. Can I have a sip? (Alcohol sloshes in Mickey) (Coughs) Oh, wow, that's... that's flavourful. I'm tired, London. London : Yeah, me too. Hud : Tired of losing people. I'm the only one of us who's lost patients. London : For what it's worth, I can't believe you're as together as you are. And you're not the only one of us. You're the first one of us. It'll get easier, right? London : I don't think it's ever gonna get easier. And honestly, I don't wanna be the type of doctor that ever gets used to losing people. Maybe there's a middle ground. Do you want a hug or something? Hud : No. London : Come on, isn't that what the humans do? Come on. ♪♪ London : (Gasping slightly) Hey, Hud. Hud. Hud : What? London : I can't really breathe anymore. (Amused sigh of relief) Hud : Sorry. London : It's okay. See? There. Aren't you glad I didn't go away? Hud : (Uncomfortable chuckle) Go away, London. London : (Laughs) (Door opens) Scarlet : There you guys are. Hud : (Clears throat) Scarlet : I'm starving. Seth : Scarlet said today was a little intense. I thought a little comfort food might help. London : Oh, yeah, thanks. Definitely. (Kiss) Hud : (Clears throat awkwardly) (Dylan's stomach growls loudly, Wes laughs) Wes : What the hell was that? What-what was that? Did you not have anything to eat at your favourite restaurant? Dylan : Ugh! You are such a nerd. Wes : (Laughs) All right, time for some apology pie. What do you want, warm or cold? Dylan : Warm. (Gasps) With ice cream. Wes : All right, go easy. This ain't the park Plaza, Madame a la mode. (Cutlery clinks, Dylan sniffs shirt) (Phone buzzes) (Phone buzzes again, items clunk in kitchen) Richard : Hey, Dylan, it's me. I'm okay, I'm okay. Veronica : You can stop looking. I got to him first. Just barely. You ever want to see your dad again, get me 250 thousand dollars. Message me back when you have it. Don't tell anyone. (Message "explodes") ♪♪
