 (Low hum of chatter) 
 London : Then you need the decaf... 
 Dylan : Hey! 
 London and Seth : (Chatter) 
 Hey, London, can I talk to you for a sec? 
 London : Oh, actually, Seth and I are grabbing coffees before our shifts start. 
 Uh, it-it can't wait. Sorry. 
 Seth : I'll see you later. 
 Well, uh... okay. Bye! 
 (Quick kiss, receding footsteps) 
 Dylan : What? 
 London : Don't "what" me. What, you? 
 You wanted to talk, so talk. 
 Dylan : Okay, um... 
 London : I have to get inside. 
 Dylan : I have to talk to you! 
 London : This is just like you. Ever since you were five years old, you stomp around in your moon boots... 
 Dylan : My moon boots? 
 London : Demanding my attention, and then when I give it to you, you clam up and expect me to read your mind. 
 Dylan : Sometimes you aren't easy to talk to, okay? 
 Why are you pissed at me anyway? 
 I'm not pissed. I'm just... I'm busy. 
 Dylan : With who? Burgundy cardigan? 
 (Tires screech nearby) 
 London : His name is Seth! 
 (Loud crash, tires screech) 
 Man : Aggghhhh! (Grimaces in pain) Help! 
 London : We need a gurney! 
 Man : My leg! It's broken! 
 London : Stay back, Dylan. 
 (Pants rip open) 
 London : Sir, I need to stabilize. What are you doing? 
 Dylan : It's gonna be okay. What's your name? 
 Man : Donnie... Doe. 
 Dylan : Well, that sounds made up. 
 London : Dylan, I said back off! 
 Dylan : I was helping! 
 London : No you weren't. You were in the way. 
 Come on, let's keep his leg immobile. 
 Come on, get him on the gurney. 
 Try to stay still. It'll be less painful. 
 'Kay, let's take him to the er. 
 (Unlocking clicks) 
 (Heartbeat pulses) 
 Dr. K : Since when do we treat patients outside and let volunteers help? 
 London : It happened so fast, Dr. K. We had to do something. 
 Dr. K : Fine. This man gets the best care this hospital has to offer. 
 He's your only patient until he's discharged. Got it? 
 I'm at a conference this afternoon. 
 Can I trust you'll take care of this? 
 London : (Sighs) Yeah. 
 Dylan : I'm sorry. I feel horrible. 
 London : I've gotten much worse lectures from Dr. K, believe me. It's fine. 
 Dylan : So can we talk now? 
 London : I gotta go, Dylan. 
 Dylan : Tonight then? 
 I'll buy all the stuff we need to make the mini-pizzas and we can binge-watch season 5 of Buffy. 
 You know, Ben is glory. Glory is Ben, right? 
 And then we can talk. 
 London : I'm working. 
 Dylan : Tomorrow? 
 London : Dylan, no offense, but if I can get a free moment, I'm gonna spend it with my kinda-boyfriend. 
 (Low hum of chatter, Dylan sighs) 
 Hud : Hey! Phone not working? 
 I texted you last night. I got nothing. No pics, no random emojis, not even an lol. 
 Scarlet : Oh, well... 
 Hud : Oh, I see. So you were obviously on a date last night. 
 Scarlet : Yeah. He's a banker. 
 Hud : Fancy. 
 Scarlet : Next date is number five, and if it goes well, we're probably gonna be exclusive. 
 Hud : Good for you. 
 Scarlet : Thanks. 
 I knew you'd be cool. You don't really care about stuff. 
 Hud : Sounds like me. 
 Scarlet : I mean, relationship stuff. 
 Hud : Yeah, I know. I hope you and Mr. Banker live happily ever after. 
 You're the best, Hud. 
 (Low hum of chatter) 
 Jared : The Dawsons are stuck in the hospital for their wedding anniversary. 
 Wife broke her hip, husband threw his back out trying to help her. 
 Mikayla : You want us to keep their spirits up? 
 Wes : Reminisce about the good old days, which they probably won't remember, so we can... get a little creative. 
 Hey, we don't treat seniors like second-class citizens at this hospital. 
 What are you, wolves? Act like humans. 
 They want help recreating their first date. 
 Make it perfect. 
 Mikayla : 'Kay. 
 Wes : Hey! Hi! 
 Mrs. Dawson : Hi! 
 I'm Wes, this is Mikayla... 
 Mikayla : Hi! 
 Wes : And we're here to help bring a little magic to your anniversary. 
 Mikayla : What are your plans... candlelight dinner? 
 Some big band music? 
 We'd like popcorn, cotton candy, and our favourite movie, Casablanca. 
 I think we can handle that. We'll track down a copy. 
 Mrs. Dawson : No need. 
 Mikayla : Oh... (Laughs) 
 Wes : Whoa. 
 Mikayla : Is this... ? What is this? 
 Mrs. Dawson : Oh, it's wonderful to see young love. 
 Mikayla : Oh, no, we're just friends. 
 Wes is super into another girl,  but he's too chicken to say anything. 
 Mr. Dawson : I was mighty scared to ask Rosemary out, but sometimes you just gotta go for it! 
 Mrs. Dawson : It's true. 
 You hear that, Wes? You just gotta go for it. 
 (Chuckles, embarrassed) 
 Donnie : Doc, when are these painkillers gonna kick in? 
 'Cause I can tell ya right now, I feel 'zactly the same. 
 London : They actually "kicked in" a while ago, Mr. Doe. 
 And based on the x-rays, you'll need surgery to repair the break in the thigh. 
 We'll insert a metal plate and a series of screws into the bone. 
 Donnie : (Giggles) Bone. 
 (Knock a the door) 
 Dylan : Hello! 
 Anybody in need of a tasty frozen treat? 
 Donnie : Love it! 
 Dylan : Yeah? What's your poison? 
 Donnie : Well... orange is my favourite. 
 Dylan : Coming up! 
 London : No frozen treats! 
 He's about to go into surgery. 
 Dylan : Oh. 
 Anything else I can do? Fluff your pillow? 
 London : We're in the middle of something and this guy has a serious injury. 
 Yes, I know. Excuse me for wanting to help, and spend time a little time with my sister. 
 What? That's what this is about? Us?! 
 Yes. Of course this is about us. 
 You think I care about Donnie Doe? 
 Donnie : (Giggles) 
 Can we at least have lunch together? 
 London : Fine. Lunch. 
 In the meantime, just, come on, shoo! 
 Wes : (Sighs) Okay. 
 Loud thump) 
 Overhead projector, laserdisc machine... 
 No prehistoric VCR. 
 Sorry, Dawsons, you're outta luck. 
 Mikayla : You're grumpy. 
 Wes : Well, you called me a chicken. 
 Mikayla : I was joking. 
 Hey, do you remember Greg the horrible? 
 He was here when I first started volunteering. 
 Why are you bringing up that meathead? 
 Remember he called me all these names 'cause my hair hadn't quite grown back yet? 
 Yeah, that guy was such a tool. 
 I mean, after everything you'd been through... 
 Mikayla : We barely knew each other then, but out of the blue, you went up to Greg... all two hundred meaty pounds of him... and said, "you can call me whatever you want, but her name is Mikayla." 
 (Sighs) But even Greg never called me a chicken. 
 Mikayla : You're not. But you have to tell Dylan how you feel before you explode. 
 Wes : (Exhales) Look, the timing sucks, Mikayla, okay? 
 And if I ask her out while she's going through all this terrible stuff, then I suck. 
 Mikayla : For suggesting something awesome in the middle of all her terribleness? 
 Something that might actually make her smile? 
 Dylan : I interrupted something. 
 Mikayla : Oh, no, not at all. 
 I have a classic movie that I need to download and Wes has something he wants to ask you. 
 Wes : Uh... how'd it go with your sister? 
 Well, we're having lunch together, so that's good news. 
 I have even more good news. 
 Dylan : Yeah, what's that? 
 Wes : Um... 
 Mikayla and I are organizing this anniversary date for this elderly couple up in long-term. 
 Dylan : That's cute. Wes: It is! 
 We're gonna watch Casablanca. 
 Maybe... you could join... Me for the screening? 
 Share a bucket of popcorn? 
 Um... I don't know. 
 After I talk to London about my dad, who knows what's gonna happen. 
 It could be fun, you know. 
 Take your mind off the sad stuff for a bit. 
 (Sighs) It's just not a good time. 
 Yeah, that's what I said. Okay, I'll catch you later. 
 Cashier : Here you go, Sir. 
 Hud : Thank you. 
 Seth : Come to my lab. 
 Nurse : Yeah, for sure, Seth. This is awesome. 
 Seth : Yeah, it's just around the corner. 
 You can't miss it. 
 Nurse : Okay, no problem. We gotta have lunch. 
 Seth : Okay. Okay, bye. Nurse: Bye. 
 Hud : Hey, buddy. 
 Seth : Me? 
 Hud : Of course, you! 
 I saw you chatting that nurse over there. 
 Seth : Oh, April? Yeah, we went to university together. 
 No idea she even worked here until a few days ago. 
 Hud : So... you and her um... ? 
 Me and her... ? Oh, no. Um... 
 I'm dating London. 
 That took, huh? 
 That's all I needed to know. Uh, April, right? 
 Seth : Yeah. Uh, London said you and Dr. McWhinnie were a thing. 
 Hud : Not anymore. 
 Seth : Ah! 
 Looking for a new girl to fill the void in your broken heart? 
 Sure. We'll talk about it over an appletini sometime. 
 (Seth chuckles) 
 Dylan : Salad? You brought salad? 
 What happened to eat-all-the-fries London? 
 It's okay, I got extra. Where do you wanna sit? 
 London : Uh... let's see what Seth says. 
 Thought this was supposed to be just us. 
 It is just us. And Seth. 
 Do you hate me that much? 
 It's like you go out of your way to avoid me. 
 I'm not. Stop being dramatic. 
 I am not being dramatic! 
 (Tray clanks) 
 Maybe you should not be here today. 
 Maybe you're right.

 Richard : Go, Dylan! Go, go, go, go! 
 Nope! No, no, no! Jump! Come here, come here. 
 (Laughing) Come here. 
 Okay. Let me see those keys. 
 Okay, so... Mrs. Inez gave me her extra key... 
 (Key and lock click) 
 And she said that we could use her storage locker if we needed any extra storage space.

 Dylan : London? 
 I need you to come home so we can talk about dad. 
 (Sniffs) Something was really wrong with him. 
 He was sick. 
 (Papers rustle) 
 London : Dylan? 
 Dylan : London! 
 (Papers rustle) 
 London : What's going on? 
 Dylan : (Sobs) 
 (Sniffles) 
 Remember dad had a key to this unit? 
 He used to come down here to think and store stuff. 
 This is his stuff? 
 He's schizophrenic. 
 London : 'Kay, that's not true. 
 I found out he was taking anti-psychotics and seeing a psychiatrist. 
 Think about it, London. 
 All those stories and games he used to make up it tracks. I-is this normal? London : Okay, let's just... There's no way that mom would've kept this from us. Schizophrenia is hereditary. What if I have it, too? I'm paranoid and I'm obsessing, and I-I feel crazy, and I... and dad's still out there, missing, and he's confused and scared... London : Hey, hey... Dylan : And we-we have to find him. London : We don't know what's going on yet, but please... don't think stuff like that about you or about dad. I'm sorry I was such a jerk to you today. I just didn't know how to talk to you about this stuff. London : Stop it. Don't worry. 'Kay, well, I'm calling mom. She took the day off, but she wasn't upstairs. (Phone rings) London : Yeah, she's... she's not picking up. Dylan : Well, should we wait? Shouldn't you be back at the hospital watching Donnie? London : No, Hud's covering for me, and I want the truth now. Oh, I set up her phone. We find her phone, we can find her. She's at a hotel? London : What? 
 
 (Inaudible page over the hospital pa system) Hud : Hey! Do you like all the... Do you like those restaurants that bring all that stuff out on those little plates? April : Tapas? They're called tapas. Hud : Right. You wanna go to one sometime and... Eat a bunch of little food? April : Hmm. I'll wear my littlest dress. That is an amazing idea. How little is this dress? (Heels clack) Seth : Whoa! Scarlet : What was that? What-what was what? You thumbs-upping Hud talking to that nurse. Is something going on there? They're-they're talking? Why is he doing this at work? It's Awkward. Seth : You know, it's not my business, but can't he talk to whoever he wants? I mean, after all, you ditched him. He's kinda hurt. Scarlet : He said that? Ridiculous! Seth : Okay. (April and Hud chat quietly) Scarlet : What the hell, Hud? Stop telling people that I hurt you. It's all over the hospital. I heard it from the lab guy! I never said you hurt me. Scarlet : Good. Because you said to my face that you were cool with ending our thing, and if you weren't, you should've said something to my face. Not behind my back to a bunch of randoms! I don't want everyone thinking I'm a bootch. So. (Chuckles sheepishly) April : I don't really like tapas. Right. Mikayla : Okay. Ready? (Whispering) How'd it go? Wes : Casablanca is all cued up. Gonna use this to project it onto the wall. (Key clacks, opening music starts) Wes : Okay. (Whispering) I asked Dylan to watch it with me, but she's got stuff going on. Mikayla : Watching a movie with a geriatric couple at work doesn't count as a date, Wes! You need to try again. Wes : No way. I "went for it" and failed. I'm done. Mikayla : What? You can't just give up just like that. You like her. Like crazy, insanely much! Wes : Yeah, and if she smiles at me, or does something really sweet, I... I will just shove all my feelings down in my stomach until they form a bleeding ulcer. But I will not "go for it" ever again. Now, can we just zip it and watch the most romantic movie ever made, please? Seth : Hey, buddy! Hud : London asked me to cover broken femur guy for her. I need these run ASAP. Seth : Right-o. Oh, so how'd it go with April? Kind of terrible. Seth : Hey, can you not... those scopes are set to a specific resolution. Hud : Oh, are they? Are they? Seth : Dude, stop! What's the deal, man? Hud : You told Scarlet I was hurt? Since when are you the hospital gossip? I got trapped. When I get trapped, I tell the truth. Hud : Yeah, well, what the hell do you know about it? Seth : Well, you seemed bothered that Scarlet ditched you. Di... (Huffs) What are... look, I wasn't ditched or bothered, so just stay out of it, okay? Seth : Okay, okay. I wanna stay out of it, believe me. But you might feel better if you stop repressing that kind of thing. Hud : What kind of thing? Seth : You're in love with Scarlet. Dude! I know what love is. Scarlet and I are not it. Seth : Oh. So who are you in love with? Hud : Bye. Seth: (Laughs) See ya, buddy. Hud : We are not buddies! Seth : You came to talk to me about your problems. Twice. We're buddies. (Birds chirp, traffic rumbles) London : Maybe she took a spa day. Dylan : And got a room? Why is mom being such a weird show? Dylan : I still can't believe you convinced the desk clerk to give us the room number. They should not give out information like that. Dylan : You just have to act like a total spinwad, and be like, "I am so sorry, but I totally lost my room key and my mom's going to, like, fuh-reak! Can you please help me?!" (Giggles, then sighs) London : I want you to know that I don't hate you... And I'm sorry I didn't listen to you earlier. It's okay. We're just different. London : Yes. But you always have me. You never have to go through anything alone. We always have each other. Got it? Jane : Girls? What're you doing here? You can't be here. Dylan : Why? And what's with the hotel room? London : We came to find out if dad was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Okay, um... look, girls, we were managing his illness. He had medication, he had therapy, and it was working. And then it wasn't. Jane : We tried... you have to believe me, I tried. I save people everyday, and I couldn't save my own husband, not from this. I loved him, girls, I really did. But by now, he is probably gone. For good. (Door opens) (London sniffles) Dylan : What in the hell. Dr. K : Uh... Shouldn't you two be at the hospital? Dylan : So you two could sneak away for a hotel tryst?! Jane : No. You weren't supposed to find out like this. This is not a fling. We're in love. Dylan : (Derisive chuckle) Well, congratulations! Dr. K : O-okay, let's all sit down and talk about this rationally. If we stay calm... London : Oh, shut up! (Hard punch) Jane : London! London : Aggghhhhh! Ugh! Hud : Didn't think you had it in you to punch anyone, let alone Dr. K. London : Whatever. He deserved it for lying about him and my mom. Did you have any idea that they were together? Hud : I stay out of other people's business. Seth : (Snorts) London: How's broken femur guy? You and Seth worked together? Seth : We sure did. London : What did I miss? Hud : Nothing. Surgery went well, your patient's in recovery. Seth : Does it hurt? London : Yeah, it really does. Seth : Awww... (Light kiss) (Low hum of chatter, heels clack) (Seth and London chat quietly) Hud : Hey. (Sighs) I'm sorry we fought. Me too. It was stupid. Forgivesies? I would never say that word, but... yeah, sure. Let's hang out tonight. What happened to Mr. Banker and date number five? Scarlet : He cancelled. Something about his wife... That I did not know he had. What a jerk, huh? Maybe I should just stick with my simple, uncomplicated, undemanding Hud. I'm a bit wiped, actually. Boo. Another time maybe? I don't think so, Scarlet. ♪ Helen comes over in sequins and Silver... ♪ Dylan : Hey! Wes : (Nervously) Hey. Dylan : Look at this. (Keys clack) My dad drew this a bunch of times. It's the same graffiti. He used to tell me that you should always have a place to go when "the bad people" are after you. If my dad was sick and scared, he would hide. Wes : And you think this graffiti drawing is a clue to where he's hiding? Dylan : Maybe. What do you think? I think it's a leap, but you might be right. Dylan : Yeah. Yeah, I am right. I know it! Oh, hey, I almost forgot. (Wes's phone vibrates) Wes : Did you just gift me a download of "Fast & The Furious 6"? Word on the street is you love Vin Diesel. Wes : No, no, no. Mikayla always gets that wrong, it's the rock. I love the rock. He is-he is literally the most electrifying... (stops talking) Uh, why though? Dylan : I felt bad that I blew you off and missed the movie today. I was just hoping we could make it up. I'm pretty much in love with you. You... and the rock. More you. I know my timing's bad. It's terrible, actually! But I... I like you. I already said I love you, so I-I'm pretty sure you got I like you from-from that,  but... look, I'm not trying to push anything, but I think you're amazing... And I just wanted to say it. ♪ Here we go ♪
