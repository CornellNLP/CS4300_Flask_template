 If you could go back and change one thing about your life, one decision, one answer, one mistake, what would you do, knowing everything you know now? Would you make the same choice and somehow get it right this time? Or would you start over? 
 Almost 20 years later, I still think about that day. 
 My first husband, Sean, and I had been so in love and so crazy and so stupid. 
 God, he was hot. 
 And then there was Lolly. 
 No one is available to take your call. 
 Please leave a message. Hi, Lolly. It's Becca. Becca Brady. Remember me? Anyway, um, I know we haven't spoken in, like... Ten years. I just... I don't even know if this is the right number for you. Um, but I'm getting married tomorrow. Again. Anyway, I just keep thinking, "Lolly should be here." You were my maid of honor in my first wedding. I think that should be a lifetime position. Anyway, I guess... What I'm trying to say is that I miss you. And I feel terrible about everything that happened. And... I wish you were here, 'cause I feel like I might be about to make another mistake. And I... Becca, we were supposed to leave ten minutes ago. I miss you. Everything okay? Of course. Good. Okay, you can do this. 24 more hours. Just get a drink in your body before you see your mother. Can I get a champagne? There's the blushing bride. Hi, mom. Hello, darling. You look worried. Thank you. You look beautiful. But what's this? I always told you not to frown so much. It's just the way my face looks, mom. I just want this to go smoothly. Honey, it's going to be fine. You've done this before, you know. Well, if it's not the prom queen and her sugar daddy. Be nice. I'm always nice to your father. Sweetheart. Hi, dad. Mwah! Hi, Sabrina. Can I tell her our news? Well... We're pregnant! My, my. Just when I thought the night couldn't get any worse, here comes the boss from hell. Did we send Juliet those contracts? Simon, can we please take off our work hats? I don't know if you've noticed, but we are in the middle of my rehearsal dinner. For my wedding. I know. Look, I'm very happy for you, and Andy's adorable, and I wish you years of wedded bliss. I just need to make sure these contracts go through. Then you can have the rest of the night to relax. Okay. 'Kay? Done. Pdf. Attach file. Can I buy you a drink? Jamie! My brother. He never wanted to come to family events, and he always left as soon as he got there. What happened to you? Mom said she didn't know if you were coming. Thank you. Well, you know I like to keep expectations a little low. So did you hear about them? Who? Dad and Sabrina. What about 'em? They're having a baby. Like a human baby? That's gross. I know. You know what? I'm gonna... I'm gonna step outside for a smoke. Remember when we used to be able to smoke indoors? I thought you quit. Ages ago. But any time I see someone smoking, I just want to French kiss them to suck the smoke out of their throat. That's a thought. Come back? Congratulations. Hi. And here's bitchy Phoebe... Courtney. To rub it all in. Thanks for coming. Of course. How many times do I get to see my beautiful cousin get married? Wait, twice? So far. That's a good one. Here you go, sweetheart. Assembled dignitaries. Rebecca and I are so thrilled to have you all here to celebrate with us as we embark on this new life together. As you know, Becca and I go way back. Our parents will tell you that they arranged our marriage when we were both zygotes. And for those of you who know Becca's frightfully organized mother, Georgie, that comes as no surprise. The truth is, I've been infatuated with Becca ever since we were just kids jumping off the end of the dock at Spring Lake. I'm supposed to wait until tomorrow for the really grand proclamations, so I'll just wrap it up by saying that I think we both feel really lucky to be here today. You must be so relieved she's finally settling down. Yeah. She can probably still have a baby if she froze her eggs. You're lucky that you had your kids in your 20s. My God, so lucky. But you know, Aunt Georgie, I always wanted to be a young mom. I know, honey. Becca's been very successful in other areas of her life. Simon obviously finds her vital to the operation. Please. She's a glorified secretary. Look, I just thought she'd have a bigger life. You know, do something extraordinary... Write a book, write a play. She's just so talented, but she was consumed by that husband and the job. Becca made her choices. Maybe she got in her own way, but look, we're here, right? So her first marriage was a disaster. Not that I can blame her for falling for that accent. Or that body. Good God. I mean, we both obviously could have told her that her priorities where out of whack, but sometimes it's better to let people do what they need to do. The point is, she's finally setting down with a nice man. You're right, honey. You're right. Let's just not dwell on the past. Let's just be happy for her now. Yes. Right? And enjoy that baklava cake. Ooh. Great news. My mother thinks I'm a failure. Your mother loves you. In her own unique way, kind of like how Darth Vader loved Luke. Can we uninvite her to the wedding? It's tempting. Maybe? No. Are you still sure you want to sleep apart tonight? It's tradition. I've never done this before. Fine, okay. Andy was the opposite of my first husband, Sean, in every way. He was sweet, kind, responsible, had a job, brought me home Indian food before I even realized how much I wanted Indian food. But did he set me on fire? Well, I was warm. Staying at my dad's place was probably a bad idea. I was surrounded by artifacts of my past. But of course now everything had Sabrina glitter all over it. ♪ Love you more than I could ever promise ♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we could just put things back the way they were? Lolly was the world's biggest whack job. She only ate cereal. She always wanted to cut bangs in the middle of the night. We had a secret language of movie quotes that no one else understood. We could barely take care of ourselves. No. False alarm. I think I'm good. Are you sure? Totally. This is the best night I had since last night. Let's go back in. Let's go! But we always took care of each other. She was the closest thing I had to a sister. Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Happy new year! I never thought anything could possibly come between us. You, tripping down memory lane? You know, just questioning every decision I've ever made. Don't you ever wish you could just go back and start over? You're talking to a grown man who's still living with his dad. You're not living here. No, no, I'm not. You're right. You're right. I'm... I'm just staying here with all my stuff, and I don't live anywhere else. It's okay, Becs. You know, I'm... Regrouping. You miss Lolly, don't you? Yeah. I think I need some air. Hey, Becs. You know, everyone wishes they could go back and start over. You should get some sleep. You look tired. Logistically speaking, it had been an almost perfect night. But I couldn't stop playing "what if." What if I hadn't become a doormat for my difficult boss? What if I'd kept my mouth shut and not accidentally destroyed my friendship with Lolly? What if I could get back all those hours I wasted watching Melrose Place? Thank you. How's it going? Long day. Looks like you're trying to solve a puzzle. "Do not pursue the past. Do not lose yourself in the future. The past no longer is. The future has not yet come." Look deeply at life as it is." It's a Buddhist proverb. You look so familiar. Do I know you? I don't think so. 11! 10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! Lolly... 4! 3! There's something I have to tell you. 1! Happy new year! ♪ Don't check, just balance on the fence ♪ 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! Hey, I'm gonna make a coffee. Do you want one? No, thank you. Who's in there with you? Actually, just give me a minute. Where's the Keurig? Where's the Keurig? Okay, where are my car keys? Linc, where are you going? Play tennis. I'm just kidding. I'm gonna pick up Sophie at the train station. Back in 20 minutes. You know, this is a great look. It's adorable. Mwah! Don't hurt yourself. Mom. Mom? What are you doing? My God. You haven't even taken your shower yet? I'm going to have a heart attack. Go, go, go, go, go. You too. I need to wake up. Wake up. I need to wake up. Phoebe. What are you doing here? Your mother wanted me around for moral support on her big day. This is my big day. Then maybe you should be taking it a little more seriously, Becca. I'd start by showering. Honestly, I never thought you'd be the one getting married first. You can't just barge in here. What are you doing? VHS tapes. A discman. Okay. This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm having a very vivid dream that it's 1995 and I'm marrying Sean today. I need to wake up. I need to wake up. It is 1995, and... and you are... You are marrying Sean today. That's happening. I'm also still naked, so... ♪ And I am happy now living without you ♪ Where did my life go? Okay, maybe I'm just hallucinating. But just in case I'm not, it is currently 9:16 a. a. on October 8, 1995, and I have 7 hours and 44 minutes before I'm supposed to marry Sean. I have to speak to Lolly. She's the only person that's just crazy enough to believe me. Lolly? It's Becca! I have to talk to you. Where are the keys? Lolly! It's the beautiful bride. Wait, I thought we were meeting at the hairdresser. Did you forget something? You could have just called me. Although I have no idea where the phone is. I turned the ringer off, and now it's like I'm living on this silent desert island. So eerie. Ha! How are you? Do you need coffee? I need coffee. It's really you. You're here. We're friends. Are you okay? Whoa, you should eat something, maybe. It's been months since you've eaten. I think there's English muffins. Unless you forgot to buy me any. What am I gonna do without you? Buy my own English muffins? Forget it. I'll just starve to death. Whatever. Go, be happy. I'll just live her alone, like a savage. I am so out of shape. That's it. Decision made. I'm going back to cardio funk. Before I forget, Simon called. He said he wants you to go into the office today. What a tool. Lolly? Something is very wrong. My God. Did you get your period? On your wedding day? Did you take muscle relaxers and now you feel like you've got cotton balls for brains? Because that also happened to a cousin of mine, and I was like, how could she not learn  the most important lesson from sixteen candles? No, I did not take muscle relaxers. And that is not the most important lesson  of Sixteen Candles. Debatable. Pinch me. You said pinch you. Okay. Sorry. And I felt it. So that means that I'm not dreaming. So that means that everything that has happened to me in my life is just gone. Poof! I get it. You get it? You're finally starting to crack under the pressure of everyone being like, "why are they getting married so young?" Because you're in love. Duh! Lolly. When I woke up this morning, I thought that I was marrying another man. That's so Freudian. It's like other pen1s envy. Is that a thing? Who was it? Andy Kelly. Ew. He's practically your cousin. He is not my cousin. Our parents are just really good friends. Yeah, but we set him up with what's-her-name, that annoying temp from your office. Marissa? Melissa? Melanie. You don't get it. I am not dreaming this. This was actually happening. I was marrying Andy Kelly. Non-blood-related, super nice Andy Kelly. I know he was dorky, but he got cute. The same thing happens to Patrick Dempsey. No. And then I blacked out in the elevator. And now I'm here with you. And I know something's wrong, because you're acting like nothing's wrong, but really we haven't spoken to each other in ten years. What are you talking about? We talk three times a day, every day, which is why it's especially urgent that I find that phone. I know how this sounds. But there is no other explanation. 
 
 Lolly. I am here from the future. Dude, I think I should call your mom. I... Think about it. I am the most rational person you know. Why would I be saying this if it wasn't true? Say something. Say anything. My God, Say Anything was such a good movie. I know. It totally holds up. I know I can prove this to you. There has to be something. Just think. You just got over the clap from that dude from Lollapalooza. Lollypalooza. With the guy with the three earrings, and you didn't tell me until after the fact, Bec... You slept with my brother. Last night. That really happened. That was you in his bed this morning. I'm sorry. My God. And you're gonna break his heart. Um, I need to pick up my dress from the tailor by noon, so I'm just gonna go and, um... and do that. And I think that you should take a nap or a siesta or something and just work through this situation. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. This sounds so crazy. You have to believe me. Do you believe me? I'm really worried about you, and I think you're probably just really exhausted. And starving. Will you eat an apple? I have to go talk to Sean. No, no, no, no, you can't see Sean today. It's bad juju. I don't think my juju could get any worse. Okay, what are you gonna wear? That? Not that. I don't know. I'm so confused. Will you meet me later? Of course I will meet you later. But promise me. No Valium. Remember Sixteen Candles. What am I gonna wear to see Sean? Somewhere in this box of demented pixie rockabilly lumberjack clothes is the perfect outfit. Motorcycle boots? Knee socks? My God, knee socks. Spandex mock turtleneck belly tees? Giant flannel shirts? And clogs, the world's most comfortable shoes. And you can walk all day in them. And look. My old beloved motorcycle jacket. God, why did I ever give you away? Sean was unpredictable. He had a bad temper and a malicious streak. He had fits of insecurity that lasted for months. He never made any money. He resented me for supporting us. And he was the best s*x I've ever had in my entire life. I thought we weren't supposed to see each other till the ceremony. That is a dumb tradition. ♪ To all the ladies in the place with style and grace ♪ Whoa... Um... Look, I'm not complaining or anything, but wasn't the whole point to save this for... Don't talk. Whoo! My God. That was so good. I should really teach a seminar. There's just no comparison. It's like taking a flight on a Cessna versus going up in a space shuttle. Am I the Cessna or the space shuttle? They both sound awesome. No. My God, I shouldn't have done this. What happens if I wake up tomorrow and I'm back? How am I gonna explain myself? Does this even count? You should buy this place, by the way. The property values around here are about to skyrocket. Becca, explain yourself to who? Is there somebody else? No, I've always been faithful to you. Great, we're gonna bring that up today, on our wedding day. No, this isn't about that. This is about me and you. I'm not even sure you want to be doing this. I was so happy when you asked me to marry you, so I just dove right in, but I never stopped to think. Like, what is wrong with this picture? This all sounds really ominous. We're still getting married today, right? That was a joke. We're still getting married today. Becca? I don't get it. Yesterday you couldn't wait for today, and now... What's changed? I love you. I've always loved you. But what if getting married sets us both off course? You can only ever make one decision, so every decision you make sets you off course. It's a universal law. No. Where are you going? Becca, what are you doing? I just need some time to think. Fine. Go, think. Go. I'm not... it's you. I'm sorry. Well, I know I'm not supposed to be eating this, but this is black cherry. This is amazing. Here, try some. I mean, just don't tell your mother. What's the matter? I don't think I can marry Sean. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, hey. Shh. It's okay. You're fine. Whatever you want to do is fine. Did something happen or... No. What? It's just, I look in the future, and I see a series of crossroads where I make the wrong decisions. You know what I wish you could see? Your face whenever Sean walks in the room. It reminds me of when you were a baby, the first time you ever turned on a light switch. You couldn't believe your luck. That's magic, kid. And you don't find that twice in your life. Becca? My God, there you are. Where have you been? We've just been here. We were not eating or anything. Look, I called your apartment. I called the office. I called si... Wait a minute. Are you crying? No. Look at your eyes. They're all puffy. Okay, I'm going to go get the Preparation H. No, mom, you're not putting hemorrhoid cream on my face. Maybe she's just hungry. She hasn't eaten in six months. Here. So help me, God, Lincoln, if you give this girl so much as one pretzel, we are getting a divorce. -She may be tiny, but you know how she bloats. Look. You see what you did? Gosh, it's just, we've all been so good about the salt and saturated fats all these months. Are you happy in your marriage? What? Do you still love dad? Of course I love him. But you argue so much. That's marriage. That's how we communicate. Isn't it exhausting? Yes. But if you think that the grass is greener, believe me, it's not. Everyone argues. Are you having second thoughts? Becca? I... I need to talk to you. In private. Is it about the wedding? Mom, not everything has to do with the wedding. Okay. Make it quick. She has to get ready. We'll make it quick. So I... I just talked to Lolly. About what? No, don't play dumb with me. I know you know about us. I don't know how you found out, but you insinuated yourself in the situation, and now she said she can't see me anymore, that it... it can't happen again. How does it affect you at all? The one girl I happen to like. Wait, go back. Go back. Like, tell me everything she said verbatim. Well, amongst other things, she thinks you're having a nervous breakdown. I'm not having a nervous breakdown. I'm just conflicted. Sure. Okay? I don't know who I am. I don't know what to do. I'm totally paralyzed with indecision, and I feel like I'm having an out-of-body experience, like I'm watching myself from here. That sounds like a nervous breakdown, doesn't it? Kinda. But she dumped you. Yeah. Yup. Which means she believes me. She really believes me. Thank you! What? No, thank you, Becca. Hi. Hi. Okay, so I went over it and over it in my mind, and there's just no way you could have known about that guy from Lollapalooza unless I got drunk and told you, and you can't drink when you're on Tetracycline. God, I... I am so embarrassed. It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is if you believe me. And since you broke things off with Jamie, you must think the's, like, a shred of truth to what I'm saying. The only thing I know for sure is, you are not the same Becca you were yesterday. Just tell me what happens in the future. God, okay. So... Sean and I split up. Yeah, we just fell apart. So what happens to Jamie? He's not great. He went to rehab. A couple times, actually. It has been a tough couple years for my family. And there was no one in the world I needed to talk to more than you. But we hadn't spoken to each other in years. I didn't know if the number I had for you was right. I had no idea where you lived. And the only email I had for you was aol. That's awful. Yeah. All of it sounds awful. Do people not use aol anymore? It's become unfashionable. But I really love aol. I know. And aol loves you too. What happened to us, Becca? Our huge fight was still years away. If I didn't say anything, maybe it would never happen. I don't want to talk about it. Not yet. The crazy thing is, it hasn't even happened yet. Well, nothing has, right? Right. Okay, Becca. This isn't just happening to you. It's happening to me and to Sean and to everyone. Patrick Dempsey gets cute? Really? No one was more surprised about that than me. I got to pee so bad. No time traveling. I'm not going to... Okay? Rough day? It's my wedding day, actually. Wow. Congratulations. Thanks. You seem excited. ♪ And the other one's giving a high five ♪ I'm a little confused. Shouldn't you be felling happy? Are you an expert on the topic? No. No. Nothing of the sort. Xavier. Becca. "Do not pursue the past. Do not lose yourself in the future. The past no longer is. The future has not yet come. Look deeply at life as it is." ♪ And the other one is flicking a cigarette ♪ Whatever, Buddha. You come here a lot? Every day. Cool. I'll see ya. See you. Who was that? Someone I met once. Cute. What is that? It's your pager, dumbo. I can't... It's Sean. He wants you to meet him. He says you know where? I do. Sean... Wait. Before you say anything, let me get this out. Becca, when I met you, I was lost. I didn't know who I wanted to be or what I was supposed to do with my life. But you wanted to be with me, so I thought if someone that great, that smart, that beautiful wants to be with me, then I must be an okay guy. But I don't want to be just an okay guy. I want to be better than that. I want to be worthy of you. So I'm asking you again. Will you marry me? You're saying everything I want to hear, but... Tell me what it is you're worried about. What is it? You at least owe me that. I'm worried that we're destined to make the same mistakes over and over again, no matter what promises we make to each other today. Listen, listen. Becca, you and me, we were meant to be together. I know that. You know that. People don't feel what we feel. That only belongs to us. Now I'm going to go home, I'm going to get dressed, and I'm going to that church. And I really hope I'll see you there. I know your mother made you swear off dairy until after the wedding, but I figured you've come this far. ♪ You've got me wrapped around your finger ♪ This is also just as good as I remember it. ♪ Do you have to, do you have to let it linger? ♪ You were the space shuttle. Hi. Hi. For you. Old, blue, and borrowed. Although you can keep it. Your dad gave me this on the day you were born. Sapphires for my September baby. You never gave this to me before. Before when? Nothing. It's so sparkly. I know you think I meddle too much. But I just want everything in your life to be perfect. Maybe it doesn't have to be perfect. Maybe if you try to be perfect, you miss everything, the moments in between. For what? Well, Becca... If you can find those moments in between and appreciate them, I think you and Sean will have a beautiful marriage. I love you. I love you. The wedding planner's looking for Becca... She's not in her dress yet? She looks like a grape. Excuse me? A vain, self-obsessed, totally insecure grape. Phoebe, um, if you can just... She'll be ready. Hey, don't worry, B. First wedding is always the hardest. I'm glad you decided to go through with it. If you could go back and change one thing about your life, one decision, one answer, one mistake, what would you do? I knew so much more now. I knew so much more about Sean, about myself, about the future. My God, Andy. He was here. Of course he was here. Our parents were really good friends. I was supposed to be marrying him today. Is that the future I want? But what if Sean and I were meant to be together? We could start over and get it right this time. I could change him, change me. We could do this. Right? Hi. I'm glad you're here. We are here today to witness the marriage of these two fine young people, Rebecca and Sean. What God has brought together, let no man put asunder. If anyone presents raises objections to this union, speak now, or forever hold your peace. Rebecca, do you take Sean to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part? Um... I'm sorry. I can't. Let's go. Are you on the phone in the middle of my wedding? I'll call you back. Simon, you take me for granted. You run me into the ground. You expect me to work like a dog 24/7. But you can't function without me. So next week, when I come in to work, I'm a VP and I'm getting that raise I asked for. Also, you should cancel the temp I hired. She's gonna be terrible. My God. My God. What do we do now? I don't know! Is that joy or hysteria? I don't know! We got to do something. Okay. Something big, something symbolic. What do you want to do? I don't know. Everything I did before was just so lame. I was so scared to flop, I flopped. And my soul mate's out there somewhere. Maybe I met him. Maybe I don't even know him yet. But I'll find him. All I know is, I want to do things differently, starting with you and me. But first... I want to smoke in a bar. Let's go! Okay, don't ask me how I got here, but I am here, in the '90s, no idea how to get back, not even sure I want to go back. I have my clogs, my favorite jacket, and my best friend. And I am going to look deeply at life as it is. I know what we need. I can't deny that running out of the church today was harsh. But there would have been collateral damage no matter what. If I cheated myself out of this chance, I'd live to regret it all over again. Sometimes it's best to make a clean break and move on. Or not.
