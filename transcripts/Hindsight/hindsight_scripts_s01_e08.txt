 Becca : Previously on Hindsight... 
 You need someone who can predict the future. 
 Do you think you can handle that? 
 More than you know. 
 Paige : Who was the guy that dropped you off at the concert? 
 Kevin. 
 He's cute. 
 I actually have a new thing too. 
 I can't talk to you, Becca. 
 It's not good for me, being around you. 
 How can I be with Jamie when there's a Kevin out there? 
 Is there someone else? 
 Maybe. 
 You could come stay with us. 
 What do you think? 
 You want to come up? 
 For weeks, I've been trying to figure out why you left me at the altar. 
 I'm chasing this. 
 We're not meant to be together. 
 This could never work. 
 Why can't you just tell me what happened? 
 Because I don't know if I can stop it. 
 Kevin. 
 You must be Becca. 
 Nice to finally meet you. 
 Kevin, is just... He's so... thank you. 
 So different from every other guy I've ever known. 
 I mean, he's... he's sweet, and he speaks my language. 
 He's smart. 
 Yeah. He's late. 
 He'll be here. 
 Lolly, I really got to go. 
 Simon left me four messages. 
 I don't think I can wait any longer. 
 God, Becca, you've been working for him for nine years now. 
 When are you gonna stop walking on eggshells? 
 When I get this new promotion. 
 All right, there he is. How do I look? 
 You look great. 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Kevin, this is my best friend in the whole world, Becca Brady. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Becca? Becca! 
 Hello? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Where'd you go? 
 [Chuckles] Sorry. Sorry. 
 Focus. 
 Kevin's leaving tomorrow and I'm still stuck in the friend-zone. 
 He has no idea how you feel? 
 He high-fived me yesterday. 
 I mean, pretty soon, he's gonna be calling me "buddy" and inviting me to play ultimate frisbee. 
 You can tell me what happens. 
 What? 
 Between me and Kevin. 
 Well, I'm assuming something must have happened between us at some point. 
 I know you know. 
 No. Lolly, that is not fair. You can't... 
 Please, Becca. 
 Look, I promise if you just tell me this one thing, then I won't ask you any more questions about the future... 
 Today. 
 Nothing ever happened with you and Kevin. 
 What? 
 You never told him how you felt. 
 Okay. 
 Then this time, I'll tell him. 
 Do you have a problem with him? 
 Because he's been here for, like, two weeks now and you've made zero effort to get to know him. 
 No, I'm... it's not like I'm deliberately avoiding him. 
 I'm just super busy with the magazine launch. 
 Our first issue comes out in a week. 
 Honestly, I have nothing against Kevin. 
 Well, good 'cause he just got here. 
 Look, I just wanted you guys to hang out at least once before he leaves tomorrow. Okay? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Hi. 
 Okay. Hey, got to go. 
 Busy week. [Chuckles] 
 What? 
 Our food hasn't even come yet. 
 No, it's fine. He can just have mine. 
 Scrambled eggs, wheat toast. 
 Oh, I ordered strawberry jam. 
 You can just change it to apricot. 
 Lolly : Ew. 
 Anyway, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about. 
 See you. 
 Do we? 
 [Spacehog's In the Meantime] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Man : ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
 Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to distribute these flyers. 
 Record stores, coffee houses, campuses, just spread the word. 
 Got it. 
 Have you ever been to a rave, Becca? 
 Oh, my God, like, 15 years ago. 
 When you were ten? 
 I was going through this whole Drew Barrymore phase. 
 We need you to go to one tonight. 
 There'll be a whole swarm of exactly the kind of readers we're targeting: Young, rebellious, uncorrupted. 
 You know what? 
 I might actually have an idea that will help us get people excited. 
 But it's sort of a different approach. 
 Instead of passing out the same old flyers that everyone's seen over a million times... 
 No offense... and asking people to buy our magazine, we do the exact opposite. 
 Are you suggesting that we don't ask people to buy our magazine? 
 Not directly. 
 I mean, we're still passing out flyers and stickers but it'll just have a hint of the magazine on it. 
 Like a clue. 
 It'll get people talking, wondering about us. 
 It's called "Viral Marketing." 
 [Chuckles] Is that like Smallpox? 
 When people see something that they don't understand, they want to know more. 
 They tell their friends, their friends want to know more. 
 It becomes infectious. 
 Before you know it, people want to read our magazine out of curiosity. 
 Not because we told them to buy the magazine, but because we didn't. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I got good news and bad news. 
 I'm busy. 
 Yeah, you're really slammed. 
 Good news is, got two free tickets to the Oasis concert tonight. 
 Great seats. 
 Bad news: I've got no one to take with me. 
 I'm working tonight. 
 Just ask Rick for the night off. 
 Look, I'm not interested in being the girl who keeps you company while you work things out with Becca. 
 There's nothing to work out. 
 Haven't you told me that before? 
 It's obvious you two have this on again, off again thing, and I'm just not interested in being a part of this Bermuda love triangle. 
 I get that. 
 Becca and I just needed one last chance to see if we could save what we'd built together. 
 And if I hadn't taken that chance, I always would have wondered, "what if?" 
 And I'm sorry you were caught in the middle of it. 
 It wasn't fair to you, but I know Becca and I are done. 
 I know that for sure. 
 You know that for now. 
 Have fun at your concert, Sean. 
 Okay. 
 Well, if you're not coming, I'm just gonna sell the tickets 'cause I could use the cash. 
 I'm not even working at the Anchor tonight. 
 I picked up a side job catering private events, and I know they're shorthanded, so if you need the extra cash, you could fill in. 
 I'm not a waiter. 
 Neither am I. 
 Man : ♪ I can't stand to fly ♪ 
 Becca : No. 
 No, Sean, you're the one who's overreacting. 
 I'm not... I'm not yelling. I'm... listen. 
 Becca. 
 I'm using my normal speaking voice. 
 Oh... hey. 
 Okay, can we talk about this later, please? 
 I got to go. Okay. Bye. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Everything okay? Are you... 
 Yeah. Yeah. No, that's... normal. [Chuckles] 
 What are you doing in this part of town? 
 Don't laugh. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 Tourist guide to New York City. 
 Did you pay money for that? 
 This was a fine purchase. 
 For the record, this book has discovered every hidden gem in New York. 
 It even knows the top-secret location of the Empire State Building. 
 Okay. 
 I... I stand corrected. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 You just seemed a little rattled. 
 That's Sean, my husband. 
 We're just having our daily fight. [Chuckles] 
 I don't even know what we were fighting about, actually. 
 Money, I think. I don't know. 
 They're all starting to blend together. 
 The other day, we got into a fight about toothpaste. 
 What? 
 Seriously. 
 He always throws away the toothpaste before it's empty. 
 It drives me nuts. 
 You got to roll it. 
 Exactly! 
 Anyway, I'm sure you probably don't want to hear about my marital disputes. 
 I don't mind. 
 Really? 
 'Cause every time I try to talk to Lolly about it, her eyes just start to glaze over at this point. 
 So... 
 [Sighs] 
 Feels good to vent. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, I'm around if you need somebody to talk to. 
 I charge $175 an hour. 
 It's worth it. I'm really good. 
 [Laughs] Okay. 
 I'll remember that. Thank you. 
 Anyway, I should probably get going. 
 It's... I have to go to work. 
 Is it cool if I walk with you? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, sure. I... 
 Man : Oh. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you. 
 So... 
 Did you talk to Kevin? 
 It's not as easy as I thought. 
 I mean, what if he doesn't like me like that? 
 What if I am just his buddy? 
 Anyway, I'm gonna tell him. 
 I am. I'm just... I'm... I'm waiting for the right moment. 
 What's this? 
 That is for the rave. 
 You never said anything about a rave. 
 I'm going to a rave tonight. 
 Why didn't you invite me? 
 Because it's for work. Not play. 
 Not for me. 
 I haven't been to a rave since college. 
 Oh, I miss raves. 
 Ugh, I don't. 
 Going deaf from techno music, staying up all night, and drowning in sweat, glow sticks! 
 No. 
 So fun! 
 No. 
 Take me with you. 
 Please? Please? 
 Please? 
 Fine. 
 Under one condition. 
 You help me pass out all these thermal stickers around the city. 
 Deal. 
 Okay. 
 Kevin, we are going to a rave tonight! 
 Oh, he probably won't want to go. 
 I'm in. 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 This is gonna be so much fun. 
 Oh, first we have to help Becca pass out a bunch of stickers. 
 Something about spreading a virus. 
 Don't ask. 
 Yay! 
 You two finally get to hang out. 
 You're gonna love each other. 
 Whoo-hoo. 
 Hey. 
 Where's grumpy Rick? 
 He left me in charge today. 
 Lolly : Oh, sweet. Does that mean free drinks for us? 
 Not on my watch. 
 Whoa. 
 Check out grumpy Paige over there. 
 I'm gonna hit the men's room. 
 Is he still on the couch? 
 Is it that obvious? 
 Well, there's a certain body language you detect when people are doing it. 
 Hey, what are you doing tonight? 
 Yeah, we're going out. 
 Working. 
 I picked up a side job at this catering company. 
 Let me know how it goes later tonight. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 I got to pee. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So that event I'm working tonight, Sean's actually working it with me. 
 So are you two... 
 I don't know. [Chuckles] 
 I mean, it was over with you two, then it wasn't. 
 No, Paige, we're done. 
 Game. Set. Match. 
 So it won't be weird? 
 No, it'll be totally weird. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So none of these stickers or flyers actually have the name of your magazine on them? 
 Nope. Just the question and the logo. 
 We have to get people talking about the magazine without actually knowing anything about it. 
 This sounds like an idea I would have and you would tell me is really stupid. 
 I mean, what if nobody puts it together? 
 Nope. Trust me... 
 It'll work. 
 This kind of marketing is gonna be huge one day. 
 Wouldn't it be easier just to put all your information on the flyer? 
 Trust me, Kevin, she knows what she's doing. 
 Should we do this? 
 Yes. Let's do it. It's freezing. 
 Well, it's about to get... Hot! 
 Hot! 
 [Laughing] 
 Boom it. 
 Whoo! 
 Yeah! 
 [Gasps] I have an idea. 
 Uh, is she actually gonna climb that thing? 
 Oh, yeah, she will. 
 Hey, so how are you doing? 
 Lolly's told me everything you've been going through lately. 
 Oh, she did? 
 Yeah, just calling off the wedding, quitting the job, sounds like it's been a real roller coaster. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 
 Honestly, it's been a little overwhelming. 
 Every now and then, I sort of forget who I am. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But even though I second-guess myself every single day, I think I still made the right decisions. 
 So far. [Chuckles] 
 I'm sure you have. 
 You got this cool, new job. 
 They're lucky to have somebody so dedicated and smart. 
 That viral marketing idea, very clever. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, let me ask you a weird question. 
 How'd you know I liked apricot jam? 
 Everybody likes apricot jam. 
 No, they don't. 
 I'm a genetic anomaly. 
 My mom used to make fun of me when I was a kid. 
 Apricot? 
 Lolly must have told me. 
 Becca : Apricot Danish? 
 Everybody loves apricot. Everybody. 
 No. 
 Yeah. 
 Nobody likes apricot. 
 Okay, fine! Fine. 
 Oh, God, I admit it, I'm the only one. 
 My mom used to make fun of me about it when I was a kid. 
 Aw. 
 Just traumatizing to get ridiculed by your own mother. 
 Now I feel kind of bad for you. 
 Don't feel bad. 
 It prepared me for dealing with bullies like you. 
 Oh. I see. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey. What are we doing here, Becca? 
 We're walking. 
 And now we're stopping. 
 We hang out every day, but we don't tell anybody about it. 
 Well, I don't think that Sean would understand that I'm such good friends with a guy. 
 And Lolly? 
 I don't want her to feel left out. 
 I'm married, Kevin. 
 I mean, we're friends, but your friendship means the world to me. 
 You're the only person who doesn't judge me. 
 You just listen. 
 No matter what, you just... 
 You understand me. 
 And I want you to know that... 
 [Sighs] 
 This time that we spend together just... 
 Just talking, it's my favorite part of every day. 
 Me too. 
 Say something. 
 For the first time in my life, I think I like the taste of apricot. 
 Lolly : Do you like him? 
 What? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah, he looks great. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Perfect. 
 Becca : Yeah. 
 Lolly : So where's the rave? 
 Okay, we have to take the N and the R and look for a guy on a platform with purple hair. 
 We pay him, he gives us wristbands and an address. 
 A scavenger hunt. 
 This is a work thing. 
 A work thing. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Let's go find purple hair! 
 Did I mention that I hate art galleries? 
 Ooh, the true artist refuses to become a sellout. 
 Paige : Blah, blah, blah, integrity. 
 I mean, God forbid you make a little money off your talent. 
 And have you been making money off your talent recently? 
 Not gonna lie, it's been slow. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Don't be. When it rains, it pours. 
 So I'm just hoping a storm is coming soon. 
 It will. 
 What are you looking at? 
 You just look really pretty tonight. 
 Get to work. 
 What about him? 
 His hair's light blue. 
 This guy has purplish hair. 
 Becca : Oh, that's got to be him. 
 Let's go. 
 Does his hair look purple to you? 
 Up close it's more of a boysenberry, same family, though. 
 
 
 
 Hello. 
 Can I help you? 
 You're the guy with the purple hair? 
 It's magenta. 
 I thought it was boysenberry. 
 It's not boysenberry. 
 Can we agree it's in the purple family? 
 We need three passes to the rave tonight. 
 [Chuckles] 
 60 bucks. 
 I got it. I got it. 
 There's 60. 
 Thanks, Kevin. 
 Isn't he such a gentleman? 
 Yeah. 
 You guys want to purchase something to enhance the experience? 
 Like glow sticks? 
 No, not like glow sticks. 
 I'm talking about E. 
 Although, I do sell glow sticks too, if that's what you're into. 
 Oh. 
 No, thank you for the generous drug offer, but we're working tonight. 
 Here you go. Here's your pass. 
 Thank you, though. 
 Sure thing. 
 But there's no better way to release your inhibitions. 
 Oh, my God. 
 DJ Will Scar is spinning tonight? 
 No way. 
 He's my favorite rave DJ. 
 No, I know him. 
 He's my friend. He has this scar on his face. 
 That's cool. How do you know him? 
 Long story. A different time. 
 Lolly! 
 What are you doing? 
 Don't worry about me! 
 I'll meet you guys at the rave. 
 What the hell? 
 Looks like it's just you and me. 
 Becca : I can't believe Lolly bailed on us like that. 
 What was she thinking? 
 It's not that big a deal. 
 No, it is a big deal. 
 She should be here right now. 
 She's meeting us at the rave. 
 No, I know, and now we're here together. 
 Ouch. 
 I didn't mean it like that. 
 I- I think you're great, Kevin. 
 I just... 
 [Laughing] 
 [Laughing hysterically] 
 Oh! Of course this would happen. 
 [Laughs] 
 What is so funny? 
 The universe. 
 The universe is funny? 
 It just doesn't want me to stop it! 
 Stop what? 
 [Sighs] 
 Nothing. [Laughs] 
 I'm just an astrology geek. 
 Bad horoscope today. 
 Look, don't worry. Lolly's a big girl. 
 She'll make it there. 
 Yeah, I know, it's just we have two hours before the rave starts, and I don't think there's such a thing as fashionably early to a rave. 
 Well, we have a few stickers left. 
 There's a lot of New York I didn't get to see on this trip. 
 I'm sure you know some hidden gems. 
 What do you say? 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 You do know you're supposed to be working the floor, right? 
 They want $20,000 for this piece of crap? 
 It looks like they do. 
 No one's that stupid, surely. 
 You see that "sold" sticker in the corner? 
 It looks like someone is that stupid. 
 No one would ever pay that kind of money for something I create. 
 How can they? 
 You hate galleries. 
 Hey, I was wondering, I don't know, maybe later... 
 Oh, looks like your empty. 
 You want to go refill your tray? 
 Where are you going? 
 We just sold this one. 
 "We"? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What, do you own this gallery? 
 No. I wish. 
 I just work here. 
 So who's the idiot who paid 20 grand for this derivative piece of garbage? 
 He's the bald guy in the red tie. 
 Don't look now. Don't look... don't... 
 I told you not to look. 
 I couldn't help myself. 
 I'm Noelle. 
 I'm Sean. 
 So what don't you like about it? 
 Everything. 
 I mean, what's he or she really trying to convey here? 
 Well, it's a good thing the idiot in the red tie disagrees with you. 
 So what do you do when you're not delivering drinks and talking trash, Sean? 
 I'm an artist, actually. 
 Ah, I should have known that. 
 Any good? 
 Well, it depends on your index for good. 
 I haven't sold anything for 20 grand... 
 Yet. 
 I'm curating a show in a few weeks with all new artists, I would love your opinion. 
 I have a few pieces in the back. You want to have a look? 
 Becca : There. How's it look? 
 Uh, it's a little crooked. 
 [Becca laughs] 
 That's what I was going for. 
 It's edgier. 
 All right, I'm all out of stickers. 
 How many do you have left? 
 One. 
 I'm saving it for the rave. 
 I'm gonna wear it on forehead. 
 Nice. 
 [Laughs] 
 So is this, uh... 
 This like your dream job? 
 I don't know. 
 It could be someday. 
 I love that I don't know what it's gonna grow into. 
 I knew my last job was a dead end, but... 
 This could be anything. 
 Do you have a dream job? 
 Yeah, ghostbuster. 
 Oh. 
 Still waiting for an opening. 
 Got my resume ready to go, majored in ectoplasm. 
 Yeah, well, you've got to dream big, egon. 
 Whoa. 
 Okay. 
 First time I saw Ghostbusters was in this tiny little one-screen movie theater in our town. 
 My mom used to drop me off, and then she'd go sit in the car and read while I saw every single movie that came out. 
 Becca : Your mom didn't like going to the movies? 
 My mom didn't mind going to the movies the first time I saw them, but by the time I saw Goonies for the sixth time, she decided to pass. 
 Parents never understood the Goonies. 
 Mm-mm. 
 I would've gone to see it with you 100 times. 
 Hmm. 
 Woman : ♪ Come away with me ♪ 
 That's why I love you. 
 What did you say? 
 I love you. 
 Woman : ♪ Come away with me ♪ 
 Is it really a surprise? 
 You don't have to say it back. 
 I love you too. 
 Remember when you joked that we should run away, live in Europe for a couple years? 
 I wasn't joking. 
 We should do that. 
 Come back when the dust is settled, get new identities, live in Seattle. 
 All you have to do is say when. 
 How are we gonna tell Lolly? 
 She'll understand. 
 I don't know. 
 Woman : ♪ Come away with me ♪ 
 I mean, we're her two favorite people in the whole world. 
 Just one of those moments I'll always remember, you know? 
 I guess I kind of always thought that... 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, um, we should probably go find Lolly. 
 She's probably looking for us. 
 Oh. 
 Sorry. 
 Becca : This is crazy. 
 Kevin : What? 
 [Lolly gasps] 
 Yay! 
 Oh, I'm so glad you're both here! 
 Oh, I love you guys. 
 You are my two favorite people in the world. 
 [Electronic dance music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So you're friends with the DJ? 
 Becca : Yeah, well, not yet. 
 He's a future friend. 
 Amazing. 
 Yeah, his name is Will. 
 He becomes a very successful music producer who did a few projects for Simon's company. 
 Apparently he was a total dick back when he was a DJ, but maybe he can still hook me up. 
 What exactly do you want him to do? 
 I want him to switch out that skull with this thermal logo. 
 Is that skull real? 
 It looks so real. 
 It's looking at me. 
 Are you okay? 
 You seem spacier than usual. 
 I sort of bought ecstasy from the boysenberry hair guy. 
 Lolly, that was such a bad idea. 
 This was supposed to be a work thing. 
 I am feeling a little warm. 
 Okay, you need water. 
 Water and air. 
 Kevin's getting me water. 
 Becca : You are gonna feel like a bus hit you tomorrow. 
 I'm serious. The comedown is not fun. 
 I just wanted to feel bold enough to tell Kevin I like him. 
 I have a feeling you're gonna be telling a lot of people that tonight. 
 I like you. 
 I am so mad at you. 
 Keep an eye on her. I'll be right back. 
 Man : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Don't cross that line. 
 What line? 
 There's an imaginary line right where you're standing. 
 How am I supposed to know that? 
 That's why I'm here. 
 To tell DJ Scar's groupies where the line is. 
 Why don't you just draw a line? 
 And I'm not a groupie. 
 Then what are you doing here? 
 I'm here to see Will or DJ Scar; He's my friend. 
 No can do. 
 Dj Scar is currently in the zone, not to be disturbed. 
 How long will he be in the zone? 
 Who knows? 
 I've seen him stay in the zone for days. 
 Oh, right, you're Owen. 
 DJ Scar's manager. 
 For now. 
 Excuse me? 
 Never mind. 
 Just, when you see him, will you tell him a girl named Becca knows how he got the scar on his face? 
 Everyone knows how he got his scar. 
 He broke up a knife fight in New Orleans. 
 The man risked his life. 
 He's a hero. 
 Cool story. 
 Tell him I know about Watson. 
 It's like magic. 
 So what do you think of the city? 
 It's everything you said it was. 
 Trip's been great. 
 I needed it even more than I realized. 
 So since you're leaving tomorrow... 
 You think Becca's okay? 
 Becca? 
 Why? 
 Just really crazy down here. 
 I don't want her to be alone for too long, you know? 
 Sorry, what were you saying? 
 Let's dance! 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Becca. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 Dj Scar said he wants you to put this in the projector during the next song. 
 No! 
 He specifically said choose the skull first then the train wreck and the mushroom cloud. 
 Then we finish with the explosion. 
 No, there's been a change of plans. 
 No, I don't work like this. 
 Man : Right there. 
 Do you know her? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Owen : Sweetheart. 
 [Noelle laughs] 
 Really? 
 Noelle was just showing me some artwork. 
 Right. 
 I'll see you out there. 
 Tray's still empty. 
 I'll be right out. 
 You've got lipstick on your face. 
 Who's the piece of ass? 
 God, you really were a dick. 
 How do we know each other? 
 It's complicated. 
 Oh, right. 
 Yeah, I remember you. 
 We had s*x in the bathroom of some casino in Atlantic City. 
 Um, no. 
 No. 
 First of all, A, we have never had s*x, and B, even if it was, it was definitely not in the bathroom of a casino. 
 I mean, do I look like the type? 
 Honestly. 
 Kind of. 
 I cannot believe how douchey you are. 
 I'm gonna make so much fun of you for this one day. 
 Take her wristband and kick her out. 
 You got it. 
 I was in the zone. 
 The zone. 
 Sorry. 
 Bitches be crazy, huh? 
 You have no idea. 
 She says she knows how you really got that scar. 
 I broke up a knife fight. 
 I know, bro. 
 That's what I told her. 
 She said something about Watson. 
 Who's Watson? 
 Nobody crosses this line! 
 I can't keep up with you. 
 Let's take a little break! 
 Good idea. 
 God, you're like a machine out there. 
 What can I say? 
 I'm battery powered. 
 You're fun. 
 I thought I was trouble. 
 Oh, you're definitely trouble. 
 So, since you're leaving tomorrow... 
 Hey, what if I don't leave tomorrow? 
 What? 
 I'm thinking of extending my trip, you know? 
 Stay a little longer? 
 There's nothing to go back to in North Carolina. 
 I'm done with Alaska. 
 It's too cold and lonely. 
 Ready to start the next chapter. 
 And you were right. 
 I fell in love with New York. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Screams] 
 I knew you would! 
 [Sighs] 
 Crowd : 12, 11, 10, 9... 
 8, 7, 6, 5... 
 Lolly. 
 There's something I have to tell you. 
 Crowd : One! 
 Happy new year! 
 Becca. 
 What are we doing out here? 
 We should be in there and celebrating. 
 It's 2004. 
 Whoo! 
 Happy new year! 
 Can you believe it? 
 It's so crazy. 
 It's like... 
 It's like the future. 
 It's like The Jetsons. 
 Sit. 
 I'm leaving Sean. 
 Oh, no. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God, are you okay? 
 We're gonna get through this together, okay? 
 Don't worry about a thing. 
 I mean, you can move back into my place. 
 It'll be our place again. 
 No, Lolly. 
 There's more. 
 I'm... I'm leaving Sean... 
 For Kevin. 
 Kevin who? 
 My Kevin? 
 We just... 
 We just started hanging out as friends, and... 
 This isn't happening. 
 And it evolved into something that neither of us expected. 
 Have you slept with him? 
 I love him, Lolly. 
 I never wanted to hurt you. 
 You know your friendship means everything to me, Lolly. 
 How could you do this to me? 
 Kevin is the one guy that I have always loved. 
 I have told you that over and over, and, what, the entire time, you were screwing him? 
 Oh, my God. 
 I'm so stupid. 
 I told you, when he moved here, that it was fate, that I knew that we were gonna end up together. 
 You never told him how you felt, Lolly! 
 But you knew! 
 You knew about it, and you did this anyway. 
 How long? 
 Six months. 
 Six months. 
 Right in front of my nose. 
 I'm so sorry, Lolly. 
 This friendship, you know, the one that means everything to you, it's over. 
 No, Lolly. 
 Lolly! 
 You ruined everything, Becca. 
 I hope you're happy. 
 [Door latches open] 
 Lolly : There's a rumor going around that you got kicked out of here. 
 Are you okay? 
 It's okay. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'm sure I can get you back inside. 
 Oh. 
 I love you. 
 I can't believe I screwed this up. 
 The one thing I was supposed to do was come here and get people excited about the magazine. 
 We still spread the word all day. 
 I mean, people are gonna be wondering what all those crazy stickers mean. 
 So, yay for vandalism. 
 Yeah, for what it's worth, I used my last sticker, put it on the mirror in the men's room. 
 See, Becca. 
 Even more vandalism. 
 Owen : Becca. 
 Scar wants to talk to you. 
 Hey. 
 So what's this? 
 It's a clue. 
 Care to elaborate? 
 No, I can't say more than that, but you'll know in a week. 
 How'd you know about Watson? 
 You told me about him. 
 You were eight years old when he got off his leash. 
 You ran after him and fell into a barbed wire fence. 
 I never told anyone that. 
 I must have gotten really drunk with you. 
 You sure we didn't have s*x? 
 If I put this in for you, can we keep the whole fence thing between us? 
 What fence? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Becca Brady, but you don't know me yet. 
 You're really good at this. 
 I know. 
 I think you'll be an even better music producer one day, after you ditch Owen. 
 Lolly! 
 Lolly! 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Guess what? 
 What? 
 He's staying. 
 He said... 
 He's fallen in love with New York. 
 Man : ♪ That's what I've been thinking of ♪ 
 What a night, huh? 
 Hey, thanks again. 
 I really needed the cash. 
 You earned it. 
 You gonna be okay getting home? 
 I'll be fine. 
 We're gonna get going. 
 You're going home with her? 
 She just wants to see my artwork. 
 [Scoffs] Right. 
 I'm sure that's what she's interested in. 
 Isn't that why you invited me here tonight, so I could make a connection? 
 A professional connection. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I'm not doing anything wrong here. 
 I'm free to make any kind of connection I want. 
 It's not like I'm spoken for. 
 You've rejected me every day for two weeks. 
 Man : ♪ If fish were born to fly ♪ 
 All good? 
 Yeah. 
 So have you told him how you felt yet? 
 Not yet. 
 But it doesn't matter now. 
 He's not going anywhere. 
 There's no rush. 
 You think I should tell him anyway. 
 You need to decide that. 
 Lolly : Kevin! 
 There's something you should know. 
 You're so much taller than you were a few minutes ago. 
 How'd that happen? 
 Or am I shrinking?

 Next time on Hindsight... 
 I'm meeting Kevin for dinner. 
 So you are wearing your "kiss me" lipstick and your "sleep with me" dress. 
 I think that deserves a celebration. 
 Let's have a party. 
 Let's make a pact. 
 You have to kiss someone under the mistletoe, ok? 
 All : Cheers! xxxx You cleaned up nice. 
 Mistletoe. 
 Well, I guess this means we have to kiss. 
 Why do you care who I date, Paige? 
 What's going on with you and Kevin?
