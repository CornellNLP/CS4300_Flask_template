 Becca : Previously on Hindsight... 
 So tell me about this kiss with Andy. 
 Becca : I just need to know if he felt the same thing that I did. 
 Well, there's only one way to find out. 
 Melanie : I've never made out with someone else's boyfriend. 
 I quit. 
 Get back here! 
 Hi. 
 I'm Todd. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Lolly : Looks like someone's taking a shameful walk this morning. 
 Guilty. 
 So... 
 How did the psychic get here? 
 Since you got her fired... 
 That was you. 
 I remembered that grumpy Rick was down a waitress, and I called him  last night, and he hired her. 
 And why were you so sure I was gonna break Jamie's heart? 
 Because it already happened once. 
 I'm not your puppet, Becca! 
 You deserve to know the truth, and the truth is... 
 Lolly : So, Rebecca, I see you have a Bachelor's degree in English Literature. 
 Edifying, but not so very useful. 
 Where do you see yourself in the future? Well, I know where I don't want to be: Trapped inside of a cubicle, fetching coffee, rolling phone calls, and being yelled at by my boss, because he has too many croutons on his salad. I want to be fulfilled, make a difference. Be creative, get paid, and I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. Right, and why should we hire you, over our other qualified applicants? Because I'm from the future, and I have decades more experience. Than anyone else you're meeting with. Jolly good show, yankee. We'd like to hire you posthaste and offer you many quid. God Save the Queen. Oh, okay, I have to get to sleep. My first interview is at 8:30. I can't have eye bags and the world's flimsiest  resumee. Don't worry. You were brilliant before you time traveled, and then you frickin' time traveled. I mean, how many 23-year-olds can bring that to the table? Thank you for practicing with me. I love you. This is widely known. [Laughs] Wish me luck. Good luck. Thank you. Good night. Good night. You're late. Well, I kind of thought Becca might get suspicious. If I snuck over when she was still here. [Laughs] Mmm. Mmm. Is that a clown horn in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? [Horn honks] Ahh! Just getting in the Halloween spirit. Oh, I love that you love Halloween as much as I do. I feel like everybody else has outgrown it. I've never outgrown anything. Clothes? Yes, clothes. [Laughs] Mm, Becca has to be up early tomorrow. Well, you know, I love it when you talk dirty. Oh, I'm sorry. Just you have to get out of here before she gets up. Well, maybe I should just go right now. No. Not an option. No, leave it on. [Laughing] [Siren wailing in distance] Man : All right. All right. Woman : Hurry up, would you? [Gasps] Oh, my God. Jamie, wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. My alarm didn't go off. You have to get out of here before Becca finds us. Why don't we just tell her already, you know? It's been weeks. Aren't you tired of all this sneaking around? Not really. It's part of the fun. You know what would be fun? Going out in public like a real couple. Oh, is that what we are, a couple? I don't do any of this with any of my other friends. Come on; Let's do something together for Halloween. Becca and I always go to the Oar and Anchor for Halloween. Last year, we went as Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, and we still lost the stupid contest. So? We'll win it this year. But I can't ditch Becca. I mean, Halloween's our thing. Then again, we have lots of things. And you and me kind of need a thing. Well, besides this thing. So is that a yes? Yes. So it's a date. Now I just have to tell Becca. [Knock at door] Becca : Hey, Lol, have you seen my... [Gasps] Lolly and I are dating! She seems cool with it, you know? Lolly : Becca! No. I'm sorry, okay? You're upset. I get it. No, I don't think you do. Of course I do. I lied to you. I said I'd stop seeing Jamie, and then I snuck around with him anyway, which actually made the s*x even hotter. And that makes me feel bad too. Also, I put your black cardigan in the wash and shrank it. It's doll size now. Just be mad at me all at once about everything. I just saw my little brother's pen1s. I don't have a brother, but I imagine that would be a little weird. Yeah, a little. You've never seen it before? When we were kids in the bathtub. I can't talk about this. I have to go do an interview, and now I'm gonna have that in my head; Thank you. I'm sorry! [Alternative rock music] ♪ 
♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ♪ Man : That's my Salesman of the Year trophy. I sold more ad space for this magazine. Than the next three guys combined. [Chuckles] Your resumee is impressive. But how could you possibly have 17 years experience in publishing? Oh, does that... That should say 1.7. But trust me, you'll think it's 17. [Chuckles] Can I give you a hand with that chair? Stand up a sec. Okay. Try that. [Chuckles] Better? Yeah. Dominique : You won't have time to sit around. Nigel can be very demanding. You'd be on call 24-7. He never knows what he will need or when. He's a genius... Obviously. Are you using digital film here yet? How do you know about digital film? Because it's a thing now. I didn't know it could do that. Yeah, windows 95 can be tricky. Okay, so here's the task bar. Just click this and then the start menu, and you have a shortcut to all your documents. You make it look easy. I can't stand computers. Becca : I think they're here to stay. Someday we'll get everything from our computers: Books, airline tickets, boyfriends. [Laughs] I don't think so. [Indistinct chatter] Becca? Hey, what are you guys doing here? Just grabbing a quick bite. We try and meet a few times a week. Andy wants us to see each other as much as possible. So what brings you to this part of town? Oh, I just had another job interview. I think I've had, like, 20 this week. They're all starting to blend together. Ugh, you poor thing. It must be awful starting over with nothing. But I'm sure things will get better. Actually, things are going quite well. That's so good to hear. Simon says he'll be asking for your job back by Christmas. Oh, look at me, "Simon says." Working for him for two weeks, I'm already beginning to talk like him. [Laughs] So what are you interviewing for? Is it something more creative? I'm pretty much exploring anything and everything. So I hear. Sorry? Oh, come on, Becca. It's just us. Lois told me about you and Tom. Oh, Todd, and it was nothing. So are you gonna bring Tom to the Halloween party? What Halloween party? The one at your bar. You invited us a few weeks ago... Before you lost your job. Oh, right. Yeah, at the Oar and Anchor. They always do a great costume contest. This one time, Lolly and I went as Tonya and Nancy. [Chuckles] Wait, that was last year. That was in very poor taste, actually. That sounds fun. Are we going? We haven't decided yet what we're doing that night, but maybe. You guys should totally come. Why did I invite her? Who knows? You did it 20 years ago. I don't remember her being so mean. She's probably threatened by you. I mean, you've been talking about Andy's supercharged lips for two weeks now. I guarantee she can sense that. That kiss meant something. I know he said it was a mistake, but he felt it too. And now meerkat Melanie's always watching, so I'll never get him alone. I know what will make you feel better. Okay, anything. Woman over answering machine : Hi, this is Mary Hoffman at Sagan Insurance. We're calling to offer you the admin job that you interviewed for over here. Give me a call. Oh, that does make me feel better. What's a meerkat? A little desert cat that stands up. Woman over answering machine : Hello, this is Dominique calling from Nigel Cage's studio. Nigel was very impressed with you. And would like you to begin immediately. Oh, my God, two job offers in this economy? Man over answering machine : Hi, Becca, this is Steve from human resources at Buckman, Johnson, Willoughby and Huff. I've got some great news. Call me back. Yes! No, no, no. There's another one. Woman over answering machine : Hi, Becca, it's Melanie. It was so good to see you today, so we've decided to swing by your little soiree after all. No, no. Melanie[b]: We'll be there on the early side. No. See you, Becca. [b]Both [Chitters] Oh. No, you can't go as Tonya Harding again. It's bad luck to wear the same costume two years in a row. Why am I even going to this party? Between Melanie draping herself all over Andy, and you canoodling with my brother, it doesn't exactly sound like a thrill a minute. I thought you said you were cool with me and Jamie canoodling. I am cool with it. It's just weird having your best friend. Hook up with your brother. Ross flipped his lid when he found out Chandler was dating Monica. Wait. What? Monica and Chandler start dating? Oh, I'm sorry. You are the worst time traveler ever. You tell me everything I don't want to know. And nothing I do. I know. I'm awful at this. I just... what are we gonna be for Halloween? I need help. Like, I thought we had more stuff. I was thinking... I should probably go to the party with Jamie, because I already said that I would. But that's our thing. But we have lots of things. Listen. I really like Jamie, okay? And I don't want anything bad to happen to him. I mean, maybe I can help steer him in a better direction if you tell me the whole story. Okay. Right after you guys broke up, Jamie called me. Something was wrong. And I was worried, so I went to his place, and I found him. They had to pump his stomach. They said I was lucky I found him when I did. God, that's awful. Yeah. I'm sorry you had to go through that. [Sighs] Do you want me to stop seeing him? I mean, for real this time? No. Just promise me you'll be careful with him. I promise, double-stamp it, no erase-ees. Okay. Are you sure you're okay with me going to the party with Jamie? Yeah, totally. Absolutely. I'm all good. Mwah, mwah, mwah. Mwah. [Knock at door] Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I can't visit my brother? It's rarely happened before. Great. I'd like to change that. Okay. Nice. [Sighs] Make yourself at home. Isn't that what we're doing now, making ourselves at home in each other's places? Oh, there it is. All right, lay it on me. Say what you came to say. I'm listening. I'm just gonna tell you what I told her. Okay. Just... be careful. Like, use prophylactics? I'm serious. You always get too attached. You used to cry for days about every dead goldfish. Thank you for caring. I'm an adult now. And Lolly is not a goldfish. I'll leave it alone. Thank you. Just know... Mm-hmm. I'm always here if you need anyone to talk to. Oh, my God. It's time for you to go. I'm serious. Thank you, mom. Thank you for showing up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your mom is hot. All right, I've narrowed it down to these two. No law firm? Their office is on the 32nd floor. Too many stairs. Got ya. All right, photographer is brilliant... Mm-hmm. Although I got a creepy vibe from him. Insurance company would be more stable, normal work hours, excellent health benefits. Sorry, did I just fall asleep? The last thing I remember, someone was talking about health benefits. Hey, at least I'd have a life outside of work. I didn't have that with Simon. What do you think? Coming this fall to a theater new you, a girl travels back in time to find... A boring, entry-level job. Would you watch that? I wouldn't. I need to pay rent. Why don't you just work here? We're here all the time anyway. The last thing I want to do is work in a bar. You're right, 'cause nothing's worse than working in a bar. No, Paige, I didn't mean it like that. You're working here to take time for your career. But working in a bar is not a career. Oh, God. Rick, I'm sorry. No offense. Real smooth, Cliff. I'll be right back. I need to go tell the busboy he's wasting his life. I'm sorry. Becca's just cranky 'cause she can't figure out what to do with her life. Oh, and also, I'm sleeping with her brother, so there's that. You know, you do have this little happy, s*x glow thing going on. Mm-hmm. I know, right? Mm. Oh, I love new things. It's so great before everything inevitably becomes all complicated and weird. Tell me about it. I actually have a new thing too. Tell me everything, immediately. Just some guy. He came in last week. And we totally started hanging out after my shift ended. Very, very cute. I want to meet him. No. Is he coming to the Halloween party? I don't know. I'm mean, 'cause it's not anything serious. We're just hanging out, but I'll keep you posted. I dig that. Ricky : Less talking, more working. Rick, we're bartenders, we're supposed to do both. He seems so much happier since you started working here. Is this from my dartboard? Yeah, I was just borrowing it. Is that okay? Can I borrow your jacket for a bar rag? I'll put it back. [Groans] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend anybody. You know that, right? Make it up to me. Tell me who wins the costume contest. I don't know. Let me help. The year was 1995. You and Sean had just come back from your honeymoon, and you wanted to show off your tan, so you dressed at gladiators and watched as someone hoisted the trophy into the air. Who was it? Simon had a plumbing emergency that night at his house. By the time I got to the party, it was over. Oh, you are useless to me. I had to share a cab home with Andy and Melanie that night. They got into a fight about their costumes. But Melanie works for Simon now. So she's not gonna make it to the party. Do you have fishnet stockings? [Upbeat rock music] Mm, fishnets. Sexy. ♪ They're for Becca. Less sexy. [Oinks] Hey, can we make a rule where we don't mention my sister's name around sexy things? Okay, but you're gonna have to give me a list of things that turn you on. It would take less time to make a list of the things that don't. How about we just don't mention her at all? Okay, deal. Deal. This is exactly how I want my room to look. Me too. [Singing indistinctly] ♪ [Exhales] That'll do, pig. ♪ [Funky music] ♪ [Laughs] There we go. Now all we need is a needle full of adrenaline. Jamie, I just want you to know if things ever get weird. With us, you know, you can talk to me. Things are getting kind of weird right now. No, stop it. I'm serious. I know. I can see that. And it's freaking me out. ♪ Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted. Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy, so dance good. ♪ [gasps] [Giggles] Couldn't I have gone as, like, the Mad Hatter. Or the Cheshire Cat or something cooler? Really, anything would have been cooler than this. I think you look adorable with the cute tail and the floppy ears. Just what every grown man wants to hear. [Laughs] Maybe we should just skip the party. ♪ [Pager beeping] [Sighs] [Beeping continues] [Groans] [Telephone rings] Hello. It's Melanie. Hi, Melanie. What's wrong? Melanie : Simon's out of town, and his bathtub overflowed and flooded his whole apartment and the apartment downstairs. He told me to deal with it. What the hell do I do? Becca : Calm down. Just page the plumber's emergency number. It's in his rolodex. The plumber's name is Sal. Then meet him over at Simon's place, but use the service elevator. And don't forget to take off your shoes. But I... why do I have to, like, physically be there? I can't do anything for him, and I bought this amazing costume for tonight. No, Simon would freak out if you weren't there to supervise. I know, but it isn't fair. I'm so sorry, Melanie, but I'm sure things will get better. Okay, sorry. I have to go. I'm late... [Sighs] For a very important date. [Hip-hop music] Whoa, you look hot. Yeah? Am I doing the right thing? Absolutely. Wait. What thing are we talking about? By going after Andy like this. Is this alcohol? Didn't you say Melanie ends up dumping him, basically tearing his heart out of his chest. And leaving behind a shell of the man he once was? I said she left him. I think you made up that whole other part. Look, the point is, you don't owe Melanie anything. And if you really think Andy might be the reason you're here, then you owe it to yourself to find out. Okay. And you owe it to Andy to let him see you in that outfit. Awoogah. Thank you for the fishnets. Anytime. [Laughs] Okay I'm out. Whoo! 
 
 [Knock at door] Nice. Wow. Okay, so I know that Melanie had to go to work, but I was wondering if you still wanted to go to the costume party with me. Well, I'm dressed as a giant white rabbit. [Laughs] How could I possibly refuse an invitation from Alice? I mean, what are the odds? I think my costume needs an upgrade. I'll be right back. Okay. Oh, a very merry unbirthday to me. You're late, Jamie. There is no Beavis without Butt-head, so get your butt down here. And your head. Okay, bye. Yeah, all right, Lolly. I'll be right there. Uh, dude, she can't hear you. What? Dude, answering machine. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh... guys, what the hell, man? I thought I told you to tell me when it was 7:00. What's the big deal, dude? She's just some chick. No, she's not, okay. She's not just some chick. Oh, jeez, jeez, jeez, jeez, oh, jeez, oh, jeez. [Laughter and indistinct chatter] [Rock music] [Gasps] There she is. Hey. [Laughs] [Groans] What am I, a lightweight? Oh, well, in that case... There you go. Mwah! You're an angel. And you have a nice Beavis. [Laughter] Oh, I hate this costume. I can't believe I let Jamie talk me into it, and he's not even here. Oh, he's probably just running late, you know? Yeah, I hope that's all it is. Well, what else would it be? Mm, nothing. It's no big deal. I just really want to win the contest. Well, if he doesn't show, I mean, there's plenty of butt-heads here. That is true. Wait. Is your man here? No, not yet. But I have been propositioned by a drunk scotsman in a kilt. So I've got that going for me. Which is nice. Yeah. I'm sorry I've been so weird lately. You don't get to own that. It was my fault too. No, no, I have been all over the place. Well, I'm just glad things are back to normal. Besides Melanie hating me. She doesn't hate you. Your tie. You never could tie a tie, I always had to do it for you. You never tied a tie for me. When we were kids. Your shoelaces. Remember? Thank God they invented velcro. Yeah. Thank God. Better. How goes the job search? Good. Really good, actually. I'm deciding between a couple of offers. That's great. You're too creative to work for a guy like Simon. He sounds like a nightmare. Well, remember, Melanie has that job now. Right. Forget I said that. Melanie likes the challenge. I mean, why else would she be dating me? I can't even tie a tie. You could always get a velcro one. [Indistinct chatter] [Hip-hop music] I'm so, so sorry. I'm so sorry. [Sighs] I couldn't find my costume, but I just figured, you know, I could do the voice. And draw a butt on my forehead. Do you have a pen? You couldn't find your costume? No. I know. How much have you been smoking? The usual amount. Look, I know. I'm sorry, okay? Look, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go home, and I'm... I'm gonna find it. No, no. Just forget it. I really, really want to, okay? I promise I'll be back in time. Yeah, right. Jamie standard time. Hey. Settle down, Beavis. Huh? Uh-huh. All right. I'll be right back. I promise. Go. Okay, I'm going, Beavis. Yo, Beavis! Ow! Beavis! Nice costumes! Whoa, it's like you were meant to be together. [Nervous laugh] I'll go get us some drinks. Okay. You look awesome. Yeah, right, says the smokin' hot Alice to the ugly teenage boy. You are not ugly. Where's Jamie? Mm. Mwah. He should be here any minute. Well, he better be. I know how much you want to win this contest. I can still win. There can be a Beavis without a Butt-head. Uh, Doogie Howser? Virgin? I can be your Butt-head. You can be my Butt-head. [Both giggling] [Laughs] [Rock music] Sean? ♪ [Man singing indistinctly] ♪ I don't think he heard you. [Gasps] What the hell just happened? Are you talking about the part where Sean walked into the bar. Or the part where he kissed Paige. Or the part where you panicked and ran into the bathroom? No, what is he doing here? He's allowed to come here. It's not like the bar left him at the altar. You mean he's dating Paige now? Like, when did that happen? No, no, no. They just met. It's not a thing yet. You knew about this? Ah! How could you not tell me? Not now! I knew that she met someone. I had no idea it was Sean, and trust me, there's no way Paige knows he's your ex. Why are you defending her? You barely know her. Come on, Becca. We both know you're not upset because he kissed Paige. He could've kissed anyone, and we'd still be having this conversation. You're not arguing. That means I'm right. Ugh. Look, I know you don't like it, but Sean is allowed to kiss other girls now. And you're having fun with Andy, so, you know, don't let this ruin your night. Wait till he sees how fat Axl Rose gets. He does? Stop ruining the future for me. I feel like he's just doing this to mess with me. Well, then don't let him. The best thing you can do is just go out there and act cool. Or you could stay in the bathroom forever. Maybe get a job handing out mints. No. I can do this. Vamonos! I'm really sorry about the whole... Thing. The wedding. I heard you went to Aruba. How was it? It was great. Great food, great weather, great people. That sounds... Great. Yeah, it was. I sound like a travel brochure, but really, it was good to get away for a while, you know? Yeah, yeah. Becca : What? They've never spoken a day in their life, and suddenly they're best friends? Just remember the plan. Go over there and act cool. I'll be right by your side. Okay. Hey, guys. [Clears throat] I like your costume. It suits you. Thanks. I like your tats. They're fake. You look good. You look happy. I am. I wasn't at first. Going on that trip without you was pretty depressing, but I woke up one morning with a sense of clarity. You're right. We're better off apart. Well, I'm glad we're on the same page. Not the bartender Paige, who I think I just saw you kissing, unless I was hallucinating, but, like, you know, like, a page in a book. I know. We've just been hanging out. Right. I see. That's cool. I don't need your approval. No, I know. It's cool. She's cool. We're cool. We're totally... We're... we're... Cool. Right. We're cool. Great. See you around. Okay, yeah. And here you go. Man : Thank you. Ooh, can this wait? I'm really busy right now. Sean and Becca were supposed to get married a few weeks ago, but Becca left him at the altar. Still busy? Um... How can he not tell me that? Probably be tough to work into conversation. Not really. "Good day, mate. I'm Sean. The woman who left me at the altar is a regular here. Maybe you know her... 
Becca?" See? Real easy. That's your Australian accent? Aren't you supposed to be an actress. Oh, got jokes? Well, let's hear you try it. I am trying to stay in character as Beavis. Don't confuse me. Oh, here he comes. Uh, hey, baby. Come to Butt-head. [Chuckles] [Men shouting indistinctly] Man : What's up? What's up? What's up? Man : Where's your drink? Where's your drink? Over there. Drink. Oh-ho! Man : Yeah. Man : Do you like my costume? Hey, girl. What's up? Hey, Cameron. Hey, "Cameron"? Love the costume. Ferris Bueller? It's Gordie Howe. Oh. You know, mister hockey? Right. So, um... Hey. Hey. Who's this guy? You want to get out of here? Um... Good talk, Todd. Good talk. I'll see you later. Sorry. Was I interrupting something? No. No, you were actually rescuing me. Good. That's what I'm here for. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Oh, he's harmless. Oh, no, I meant, uh... I meant with Sean. Yeah, no, I was... I wasn't expecting to see him tonight... Or the fact that he moved on so quickly. Well, haven't you taken the same amount of time as him? It just felt a lot longer to me. [Sighs] I just want to look at the person I'm with and feel like I've won the lottery, you know? Do you feel that way about Melanie? I love being with her. And I love that she accepts me for who I am. Yeah. She once tried to play D&D with me. [Laughs] She was really grossed out that all the women dwarves have beards. That is kind of gross. Yeah. I just... I really like that I can be myself around her. All right, all right. Who is having a happy Halloween? [Cheers and applause] And who wants me to just go ahead. An announce the costume contest winner so y'all can keep drinking? [Cheers and applause] That's what I thought. All right, well, give it up for this year's winners: Beavis and Butt-head. Whoo! Whoo. I can't believe we won. [Jamie grunts] All right. Ew. Beavis and Butt-head don't kiss. Since when? [Laughs] Thank you so much for sticking by me tonight. You've always been there for me. [Chuckles] I knew it. It's not enough to ruin your own relationship, Becca, you have to mess with mine too? No, Melanie, this... I'm so stupid. I should've confronted you the second I found out you kissed him. [Sighs] Melanie, wait. No. [Crowd gasps] All right. Let's go, Axl. Come on. Out! Now I know why you left me. [Door rattles open] Come on. Cool off someplace else. Rick, I'm sorry, mate. Whatever. See you on trivia night. I can't believe she cheated on me. You don't even know what happened for sure. And you don't know anything, so maybe you should stay out of it. [Sighs] Well, I do know that you kissed me in front of everyone just to make Becca jealous. I know that. I don't even care about Becca. Yeah, well, you have a real funny way of showing it. Look, let's just go back to your place, and I'll prove it. No, I pass. I think you need some time to just figure things out. There's nothing to figure out, okay? Yeah, well, tell that to your hand and bunny foo foo's face. Huh? Oh. I've never been punched before. I am so sorry. No, don't be. I mean, look at me. I'm very threatening. It's my cross to bear. Ow. Ooh. Ooh, God. Yeah. This is all my fault. You would've never gotten hurt if I didn't drag you out tonight. Hey, you didn't drag me anywhere. Okay? I came willingly. And anyway, I should be the one apologizing. Should've never told Melanie I kissed you. No, don't apologize. Your honesty is one of the things I've always loved about you. [Gentle music] ♪ She thinks I have feelings for you. Just tell her you don't. I don't want to lie to her. ♪ You should go home to her. Okay. [Sighs] [Engine turns over] Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? Aren't we gonna go celebrate? Uh, I think I'm just gonna go home. Oh, well, I'll come with you. No, you should go and meet up with your friends. We won the contest. Isn't that what you wanted? I don't care about the contest. I just wanted to go on a real date, with a real guy, not a cartoon character. It's Halloween. Everyone's a character. [Scoffs] I know I messed up earlier, and I did everything I could to make it up to you, and you're still pissed at me. I'm sorry. [Sighs] This wig's so itchy. I'm just tired, I guess. Look, let's just, um... Let's just talk tomorrow, okay? Fine. Well, congratulations, I guess. Keep it. [Melancholy music] ♪ [Trophy shatters] [Sighs] What's wrong? Why aren't you out celebrating your big victory? Aww. Jamie was being a butthead. [Laughter] What did he do? Nothing. It's what I did. I never should have asked you about the future. Now I can't stop thinking about it. Welcome to the twilight zone. [Laughs] Must be hard to be all-knowing. Are you kidding? I don't know anything anymore. I don't know what to do about Andy or Sean. I don't even know which job to take. Well, that's because ever since your little elevator ride, you've been too scared to make any tough decisions. What are you talking about? I called off my wedding. I quit my job. Those were easy choices. Easy? Yeah. You knew they didn't work out in the future. If you worry about every decision you make, you'll be too afraid to take risks. You'll never do anything. You're not arguing. That means I'm right again. You got a do-over. I mean, how do you know that the universe doesn't have your back. And that every time you mess things up, you'll get a chance to fix it? Well, if that's true, I could never make a wrong choice. Mm-hmm. And if not, well... You're just like the rest of us. What a night. Yeah, I-I've just decided an insurance company just isn't the best fit for me. Okay, great. Thank you so much for the job offer. Bye. So you're taking the job with the bonkers photographer? Nope. I took your advice, and I turned them both down. I never said do that. I just said, you know, take risks. I'll just take a leap. Hopefully the universe has my back. [Telephone ringing] Not answering. [Answering machine beeps] Woman over answering machine : Hi, it's Mary from Sagan Insurance. I know we just spoke a minute ago, but I have something else that you might be interested in. My cousin Chester just started a magazine. From a basement of a building in Brooklyn. Anyway, he's looking for a smart, computer-savvy intern, and I immediately thought of you. IBM's brand-new notebook, the Thinkpad 701c. Stop showing off, Chester, she doesn't care about your new toy. My cousin says she's into computers. Is that the one with the butterfly keyboard? Becca : That is so cool. We don't need an assistant. I can get my own bagels, and Chester can dress himself. Or he thinks he can. In the short amount of time we've been talking, I've already connected to the world wide web. You know, I think someday that computers will replace magazines and newspapers altogether. I don't think it'll stop there. One day, people will go online to shop, buy music, watch television, movies, pretty much everything. "Going online." Nice. Look, since we don't have the resources of a big publication, we need somebody who can find the hottest bands. And the coolest clubs, whatever people are talking about. Basically, we need somebody who knows what's gonna be cool. Before it's cool. So you need someone who can predict the future? Pretty much. You think you can handle that? More than you know. [Laughs] Becca : Next time on Hindsight... We're going to see REM. Oh, my God. I have never been on a road trip before. Can we talk about something else? You have feelings for my fiancee. She's not your fiancee anymore. Can we acknowledge the fact that you've been avoiding me for a week? I mean, I left four messages. Should I stop calling? Oh, no. Man : Step out of the car, please. Put your hand on mine. Like this? Come on. We're going. I think I'll go to my parents. Suit yourself. [Crashing] [Sirens wailing]
