 Becca : Previously on Hindsight... 
 Jamie : Aren't you tired of all this sneaking around? 
 Lolly : Not really. 
 Now we just have to tell Becca. [Gasps] Lolly and I are dating! I'm sorry! At the Oar and Anchor, they always do a great costume contest. Sean? Paige : Well, I do know that you kissed me in front of everyone just to make Becca jealous. Let's just go back to your place and... No, I pass. Melanie : I should have confronted you the second I found out you kissed him. Melanie, wait. [Crowd gasps] You should go home to her. She thinks I have feelings for you. Look, let's just talk tomorrow, okay? Congratulations, I guess. Keep it. [Trophy shatters] Basically, we need somebody who knows what's gonna be cool before it's cool. Do you think you can handle that? More than you know. [Laughs] [Car horn honking] [Tires screeching] [Crashing] [Siren wailing] Becca : The open road... It doesn't matter how well you think you've got it mapped out. [Siren wailing] It can all change in the blink of an eye. [Toadies' Possum Kingdom] [Rock music] There you go. Chester : Thanks. So we'll run this ad for Alison's records in our first issue, and in exchange, they'll stock it by the cash registers. Whoa. We're giving it away? First one's always free, isn't it? But we're not writing about pop music. What are you talking about? We're a pop culture zine. Of course we're writing about pop music. And next thing you know, we're Rolling Stone running 30 pages on a band coming to grips with the harrowing demands of fame and fortune. Okay, fine. No flattering puff pieces. So what else, then? R.E.M.'S playing Chapel Hill this weekend. Maybe you could write about that. I was thinking you could do sort of like a Tom Wolfe-style piece from the kids' point of view. I mean, R.E.M.'s one of the biggest bands in America, but nothing lasts forever. You could capture the moment when this huge thing comes to this small town. Could be interesting. I don't hate it. But no set lists. I don't care about the encore. I want a visceral experience, something real. Do you think you can handle that? Me? You want me to write it? Your idea, your article. I mean, unless you find coffee runs and menial tasks personally fulfilling, in which case, by all means, decline the offer. All you have to do is get yourself there, get tickets, and write 1,000 words by Tuesday. No problem. Man : # You'll say # ♪ We've got nothing in common ♪ Guess where we're going this weekend. Paris. No! Morocco? Nope. Am I getting warmer? No! We're going to see R.E.M. Oh, my God! Wait. Where? Chapel Hill. We'll borrow my dad's car. Ah! Awesome! Where'd you get the tickets? I don't have tickets, but someone will have 'em, right? Yes, yes, I love this plan. Man : # Come between us # ♪ Our lives have come between us ♪ Hi. Hey. I'm just waiting for Becca. She's... Borrowing your dad's car keys. So where are you guys going? What? I assume that you're borrowing my dad's car keys to start the car. We're going to Chapel Hill. We're gonna see R.E.M. Cool. Hey, can we, uh... Can we acknowledge the fact that you've been avoiding me for a week. I mean, I left four messages. Should I stop calling? We're in two different places right now. I mean, you're in college. You're supposed to put yourself first. Oh, yeah, wow. That's... that's just a really polite way of calling me selfish. Ah, it didn't come out right. I just... Ah, I just need to screw my head back on, and maybe getting out of town will help. And Becca needs to get away too. She's been blaming herself for what happened with Sean and Andy. Is there anything I can do? Yeah, go back in time and stop them from fighting. You can't do that, can you? No. But, you know, Andy and I, we're like family, so I can... I can talk to him. I mean, should I talk to him? [Sighs] Jamie... You don't need to get involved. Becca : Lolly, let's motor. I got to go. [Chuckles nervously] Becca : I can't believe you got tickets. Lolly : What can I say? I got a hookup. Oh, I'm so excited for this article. In 17 years, I haven't had someone rely on me for anything like this, and I never even saw R.E.M. Before they broke up. Wait. What? I'll stop doing that. Okay, all the more reason to fulfill my groupie fantasy of making out with Michael Stipe. Eh, not gonna happen. He's not playing for our team. LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA. I can't hear you. Okay, so this weekend, we're just a couple of shiny, happy people having fun! Both : Whoo! Ah! Yay. You're here. Yeah. What's up? What is Paige doing here? She's our hookup. Yeah, I know a guy. Awesome. You've got to be kidding me. Surprise. [Lolly giggles] [Spacehog's In the Meantime] # # Man : # Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh # [R.E.M.'S Shiny Happy People] I am so excited. I have never been on a road trip before. What, you've never just gotten in a car and driven somewhere? I mean, of course, I've been with my family on the way to work, but never on a, like, road trip. Not even in college? I never went to college. Man : ♪ Meet me in the crowd ♪ Did you know Paige was in a Jordache commercial? Becca was very attached to her Jordaches. That is something that you two have in common. Man : ♪ Love me, love me ♪ 
♪ Take it into town ♪ So where are we staying? I was thinking we could stay with Lolly's dad. Wait, since when is that the plan? Surprise. What? We're only gonna be a few miles from his house. It's one night. Just give him a chance. You're not tight with your dad? Yeah, me either. Lolly grew up with her mom. Her parents split when she was in third grade. Can we just talk about something else? Should we talk about Sean, the elephant in the car? Either of you can field this. I'm totally over it. Oh, please. The hell you are. I'm sorry. Is that an accusation? It is an observation. I mean, you act like you closed the book on him completely, and it's only been a few weeks. Thank you for your input. [Sighs] Spring Lake. What's Spring Lake? Where Becca spent her idyllic childhood summers with Andy Kelly. Man : ♪ Is making me blue ♪ 
♪ And I want you ♪ The bunny? Uh-huh. Can we talk about something else? [Pete Droge's If You Don't Love Me] Droge : ♪ If you don't love me ♪ [Upbeat music] [Groans and grunts] Everything okay? Yeah. You seem a little angry at the crossword puzzle. Here's a tough one. What's a five-letter word for faithful? Melanie. Never mind. I got it myself. L- O -Y... Becca and I are old friends... That... No, Andy. Once you kissed her, you forfeited the "old friends" card. I'm sorry. I don't know how many more times you want me to say it. It's been over a week. I'm so sorry. This must have been such a difficult week for you. [Rhythmic knocking at door] Hey, man. Hey, bud. You want to grab a beer? Just want to see how you're doing. Uh... I'm kind of in the middle of something. Melanie : You should go. I need time to finish my puzzle. I'll be back in an hour. Yeah. Sean thinks I'm the reason Becca left him? Apparently. I mean, which would explain why he knocked you out. First of all, he didn't knock me out. Okay? He landed a solid punch, but I didn't lose consciousness. Mm. And secondly, I had absolutely nothing to do with them breaking up. I mean, whatever happened between us happened after Becca left him. Dude, I know you. I know you guys weren't hooking up when they were together. But, see, I'm not the one you need to convince here. [Sighs] Good point. No reason why we can't settle this over a couple of beers. Exactly. Hey, you know what? I'll give him a call right now. Uh, wait. No, no. Maybe not. Oh. Is this where your dad lives? Mm-hmm. I like it. Ready? [Sighs] Knock, knock. Dad? [Scoffs] Who are you? I'm Lolly. Are you my new mom? Excuse me? Lolly. Jesus, what are you doing here? Who is she? Harry : My daughter. Oh. The one who works at a video store? It's an honest job. I get to keep my clothes on. I'm gonna go. I'll see you in class, Professor. Aw. Is she getting an A this semester? Becca, good to see you again. You too, Mr. Lavigne. Hi. I'm Paige. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Had I known you girls were coming... I left you two messages. I never check my machine. Interesting. So why have one? That is a good question. Look, we're in town for a concert, and we thought maybe we could crash here, but it's obviously not a good time, so we're just gonna go. No, no, that's crazy. Of course you can stay. Exactly how long were you thinking of staying? Just the night, dad. Don't worry. [Grunts] Home sweet home. Great plan. You happy now? [Birds chirping] [Knock at door] Listen, Lolly. [Sighs] I'm sorry. If I'd known you were coming, I would've... Put on pants? I would've organized my day differently so you wouldn't have walked in on such a private situation. Oh, come on, dad. Another half-naked undergrad? Can I just have my therapy bill sent directly to your office? Susannah is a graduate student. Wow. Well, you must be so proud of her. How are things with you? Who, me? Your underachieving disappointment of a daughter? I didn't say that, Lolly. Your child bride down there just referred to me as the daughter who works in a video store. She asked me what my daughter does for a living. Unless I'm not up to date, you do work in a video store, don't you? No, I'm assuming that you're gonna put that film degree to good use one day, but that's not up to me. I'm hoping it's not your life's ambition, but I have no idea. Well, that's because you never ask. I need some fresh air. I'll see you guys later. Are you okay? I don't know. Not really. Becca : Lolly. Lol. Paige : Becca, just wait. Just give her some space. Fine. Besides, I need a ride. To where? To get the tickets for the concert. That's why I'm here. Remember? Right. It was seriously nothing. I mean... I mean, Becca was obviously in an emotionally dark place, but you already know that. I just happened to be the guy standing in front of her. So you took advantage of her. What? No. I'm on pointing out the fact that it happened after you guys broke up. I mean, I hadn't seen Becca in, like, ages before the wedding. You do have an honest face. I have been told that. Thank you. Look, I'm sorry I knocked you out. Just to clarify, technically, you didn't knock me out. Fair enough. Cheers? Cheers. [Sighs] Look at this. This is what I'm talking about. An hour ago, you guys wanted to kill each other. That's not an accurate statement. Now you guys are like samurai warriors, showing respect for a worthy opponent. I have unselfishly brokered peace. I am Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Mm! Now we go to the great wall! Yes! Ow! It's okay. I know how to change a tire. No. Dad. Who doesn't have a spare? Who goes on a road trip without checking if there's a spare? What are we gonna do? I need to get to that show. This is really important. There was a gas station like a mile and a half back. I'm gonna just go there. You're gonna walk? You got a better idea? My kingdom for an uber. Paige : Come on. [Indistinct chatter] Welcome to the wall. You finish it in one night, and you get your name engraved on the wall behind the bar. That is how you become immortal, and tonight, we join the proud few who have dared to attempt this feat. Rick, how many years has it been since someone's completed the wall? Six guys last night. Good for them. Is there even room for us up there? Rick... Rick'll make room. Ugh. 12 beers? [Sighs] Spoken like a mere mortal. I'm in. Yeah. My main man, he's in. Count me in too. Mel, what are you doing here? You said you'd be back in an hour. It's almost three. Okay, Andy, it's time to man up. I agree. Mm-hmm. Time to man up. Okay. [Bells jingling] Kevin? Lolly Lavigne, look at you, all grown up. Come here. Look at you. Wait. I heard you were working in Alaska. Are you back? For the moment, yeah. Season's over. Alaska's good, but Raging Rapids is still the best job I ever had. Well, that's because I was there. Yeah, you were trouble. I was fun. You remember that party we threw at the abandoned barn we broke into? Oh, my God. I still don't know what was more traumatizing, the police searching for us all night or hiding in that creepy loft. That loft was kind of creepy, but you got to admit, there was something charming about that old barn. I think it's still there. Well, what are we waiting for? [Laughs] And then once you've recruited your army, then you get to battle the Orcs with, like, melee weapons and spells and stuff. Is he serious? Yep. Yeah. But how do you battle them? Uh... He clicks a button. Well, you know, some people like to join a guild. I like to do my own thing, you know? Go rogue. He's a lone wolf. Not to brag or anything, but I do have a couple of ladies into me, and one of them is an Orc chief's daughter. Slightly out of his league. And you're okay with all of his warcraft babes? I used to think it was cute. [Chuckles] Used to? Right, who's up for a round of pool? Sean and me versus you guys. Kevin : Alaska's cold. The work's rough. It's lonely. There's no contact with the outside world, but I work hard for three months. I make what I would make in a year. I feel alive, really connected to the elements. I love it. Wow. Closest thing to companionship I have is nine sailors and 50 tons of salmon. [Laughs] Yeah, fish aren't very cuddly, are they? Let's just say I'm glad it pays well. I mean, but eventually, you got to come back to shore and face the real world. Can't hide forever. Well, I don't know anybody like you in New York. Guys there are a very specific breed of idiot. [Laughs] Any special idiots in your life? No one special. You? Just the fish. We should get going. Let's get you to your concert. [Rock music] Yeah! Ah-ha-ha! Melanie : And that is the game. Sean : Whoo-hoo. And so many of your guys' balls are still on the table. Mel, we should go. Jamie : No, no, no, two out of three, two out of three. Yes. Rack 'em up. Melanie : Hmm-mm. Jamie : So... so, Melanie... Uh-huh? You're obviously a strong woman with very strong opinions. So I was just wondering if you could give us an insight into the female mind and let us know what it is women want. Well, that's simple. A strong woman wants a strong man standing beside her. If a man doesn't know who he is or what he wants, a woman is gonna wipe the floor with him. Ouch. Melanie : Hmm. Jamie. Jamie : Hmm? How do you think Lolly sees you? Oh, she thinks I'm selfish. So, now, you're probably scrambling, trying to figure out what you can do to prove you're not selfish, right? She should know the difference between someone who's being selfish sometimes and someone who is selfish. There is no difference. How you act is who you are, unless you're, like, completely two-faced. Isn't everyone a bit two-faced? No, some people are exactly who they say they are. Man : ♪ Feelin' ♪ I think I need some help lining up this shot. Oh, yeah? All right. Come here. Okay, going for that one? Yeah. All right. Is that it? Sean : Oh, yes, yes, it is. Melanie : Yeah, okay. Put your hand on mine. Like this? That's it. Sean : Oh, yeah, that's it. [Pearl Jam's Even Flow] 
 
 Yeah! There you go. Paige : Okay. This should take us to route 157 to route 70 to highway 501. Where the hell are we? Are we going north? Oh, my God. Give me that. You are the worst navigator in the universe. Oh, wow. How the hell do you use that thing? Thank you. We already missed your ticket connection. Because you drove over a nail. If you didn't waste so much time flirting with the mechanic... How much was that, anyway? No charge. Did you offer him something other than money? What? You think I'm what? A hooker? Well, nothing is for free. Maybe I'm friendly to people, and they like doing stuff for me because I'm nice to them. I'm nice. Oh... All I know is, R.E.M. goes on in less than an hour, and I should be there writing about the preshow. You really need to stop blaming people when things don't go your way. I'm not blaming you! And I didn't invite you along to criticize me. Actually I didn't invite you at all. Well, you're stuck with me now, aren't you? [Groans] Oh, God. Yeah. [Sighs] We're lost. Great. [Police siren wailing] Oh, no. No. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. [Indistinct police radio chatter] [Sighs] Step out of the car, please. [Sighs] Do you know why I pulled you over, ma'am? I know we weren't speeding. You know, my friend here drives very responsibly, like she's 80. What brings somebody from New York state to north Carolina? We're going to the R.E.M. concert at Chapel Hill. I'm gonna need to take a look inside your car. Not without a warrant. No, you're not. Paige... Don't argue with a police officer. [Murmurs] It's okay, officer. You can look in the car. You're not gonna find anything. He's not supposed to look anyway. No spare? Yeah, tell me about it. You know, officer, we're two girls traveling alone. Why did you pull us over other than our out-of-state plates? A lot of vehicles stop here while transporting illegal substances. You think we're drug traffickers? Your tags are expired. Oh. Giving you a warning. You got 30 days to get 'em renewed. [Sighs] Okay. That's it? You pulled us over for that? Seriously... No, I'm not done here. You know, I don't think we've been shown good Southern hospitality. Y'all ladies have a nice night. Sorry to have troubled you. [Rock music playing] ♪ ♪ I can't believe you did that. How were you not scared? Are you kidding me? I was terrified. What? [Laughs] Wait a second. That was... That was all acting? Yeah. You are good. [Laughs] Thanks. Been acting since I was three. Wow. One day, this lady at a supermarket told my mom I should be in commercials. Next thing you know, I was in everything you could think of... Jazz, tap, voice. And I started out auditioning at five and worked as much as I could. I missed every school dance. I missed my prom. Prom is overrated. You didn't miss anything. Then I found out they had siphoned off all my money I'd ever made. I mean, it wasn't a ton, but... But I had enough for college, but it was all gone, so I got emancipated from them, and I've been on my own since I was 16. So that's why I didn't go to college and I've never been on a road trip. I'm so sorry, Paige. Don't be. [Sighs] I mean, it made me who I am, and... I like who I am. I mean, it's like I've lived a whole life already. Besides, they will regret it when I make it big. Yeah, karma's a bitch. Yes, it is. [Laughter] Oh, my God. I love this song. I haven't heard this in years. Are you serious? It comes on the radio nonstop. Oh, duh, I'm kidding. I'm totally sick of it. No, no, no. If you want to listen to it, we can... No, no, no. It's fine. Okay, fine. I'm like, "whatever." Whoo!

Once you've lived in New York, there's just something about it. Feels like the one and only. Plus it's the best place to wipe your slate clean and start over. I should check it out then. You could come stay with us. We have a terrible futon and a terrible coffeemaker. [Laughs] You should really come to New York. Maybe I will. Thanks for the ride, fisherman. Anytime. Later. Later. Girls! Whoo! [Laughs] Everything go okay getting the tickets? Are we in? Oh, it is such a long story. After a series of unfortunate events, we find ourselves not in possession of any tickets. What? Listen, my hookup didn't come through, and scalping is illegal on campus. Aw, man. Wait. What if this is a story? Getting zero tickets, a flat tire, and pulled over by the cops? Wait. What? Becca : All of it. Like, this wack job of a day. I mean, no one's interested in what's handed to them on a silver platter. Look around. Look at this. [Laughter and indistinct conversations] Come on! Whoo-hoo! [Groans] I'll be right back. Where's the bathroom? Are you okay? No. I thought Australians were supposed to be able to handle their liquor. Hey, this is called pacing. If I smashed that right now, you won't be able to handle me. [Chuckles] [Sighs] Becca would always get so angry when I'd come home drunk. [Chuckles] Is that funny? If you really cared about her, you would only let it happen once. There it is. There's what? You have feelings for my fiancée. You're forgetting one very important fact. She's not your fiancée anymore. Guys, guys, guys, no. Look, the wall... The wall. It's right in front of us. It's so great... Sean : You do realize you're defending a woman who barely even knows you exist. You were invited to the wedding out of obligation. Your parents know her parents. Yeah. That wedding went so well. Look, all I wanted you to know is that I had nothing to do with Becca calling off your wedding, but after spending some time with you tonight, it's clear she made the right decision. You don't deserve her. And if you're looking for somebody to blame, take a look in the mirror. Come on. We're going. I'm not going. Fine. Suit yourself. Stay here. Don't wake me up when you come in. [Scoffs] So you just assume I'll come over? Whatever you want. I think I'll go to my parents'. Fine. Suit yourself. [Rock music playing] R.E.M. got, like, so popular that it didn't feel like they belonged to us anymore. I mean, they're so huge now. Yeah, but then they came here, and it was like, all right, well, maybe we still matter to them. Becca : Oh, wait till you hear their next album. It's great. Have you heard it? Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me about my story. I really appreciate it. No worries. No worries. Are you two together? Oh. Uh, no. I mean, it's like... It's, like, whatever. We're just hanging out. [Laughter] Uh, it's... It's an open road. It is. Thank you. I'm so excited. Thank you so much. Whoo! Whoo! Oh, my God. Lolly : This is amazing! Becca : Whoo! This is why you traveled back from the future... So I can see R.E.M. from a rooftop! [All cheering] Lolly : Look at this. This is perfect. I can't believe we made it. I know. ♪ ♪ [Delicate piano music] [Door clicks open] How was the concert? Oh, like everything in life... Almost a disaster and then totally awesome. Ah. So we're leaving. Okay. It was nice to see you. Was it? Lolly, I... I don't know... Listen, dad, I just want you to know that, yes, someday, I hope to do something awesome with my degree, but right now, I'm just trying to figure out who I am and what I'm supposed to be, and in case you hadn't noticed, you've been, like, a total absentee dad for the last 15 years, so you can't just come in and criticize me and then not call me again for six months, which... Which brings me to the point I wanted to make, which is that... I don't want us to drift apart any more than we already have, okay? So in the future, just check your answering machine. Okay. I've got a layover in D.C. in two weeks. Maybe you could take the train down, if you want. Yeah, maybe. Oh, okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. [Police siren wailing in the distance] I didn't realize you had one of those spinning rooms. Yeah, we got a bit wrecked last night. Hey, congrats on completing the wall. Very impressive. [Sighs] This really blew up in my face. It's just a hangover, mate. You'll be all right. No, no, man. Full disclosure. I was trying to score points with Lolly by helping you and Andy make peace. You know, I wanted to show her that I wasn't as selfish as she thinks. And it just blew up in my face. Blew up in your face? Hey, what about me? When I punched Andy at that party, at least I thought I'd figured out why Becca left me at the altar. It was for another man. Painful, but... At least it had a reason, a point to it. But now I realize she didn't leave me for someone else. She just left me for me. Maybe Andy was right. Maybe I don't deserve Becca. [Sighs] Look, man, you want the truth? The truth is, Becca just changed her mind. You did nothing wrong. I know it sucks, man, but you just got to move on. [Spin Doctors' Pretty Baby] Paige : "It's an hour from showtime", "and I'm about to get arrested "on a back road in God's country by a giant cop who thinks"... Was he not giant? He was. He was.

Becca, you just got to figure out what you want and go for it. I mean, you're the girl who just walked out of her own wedding, quit her job, because you wanted something better in your life. So you're more than capable of making big decisions. Yeah. So if you want to see where things go with Andy, you just got to make it happen.

I don't really know what we're thinking about. Andy : Melanie is mad at me, and your ex still looks like he wants to kill me. I don't know what to do now. Me either. It's an open road. I've been honest with you this whole time, but I feel like I'm not getting the same from you. What do you want? [Scoffs] I mean, do you even know? The only thing I want right now is to see you. I'm at the cabin at Spring Lake. Becca : If you come, then I'll know. And if you don't, then I guess I'll know.
