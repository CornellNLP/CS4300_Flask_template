 I know what happened back in 1991 in Iraq and I know you're rotten. 
 You're a medic, Reed. Help him! 
 It's OK. 
 'In 1991, I was just a boy.' 
 That's when they came to my village. 
 Who? 
 Henry Reed and his army friend. 
 A man called Stone. 
 I won't give up until I find your daughter. 
 Do you believe that? 
 No! 
 I want to sleep in the shed and I need you to lock me in. 
 I'm coming, but I ask that you take this man into custody also. 
 On what grounds? 
 On the grounds that he abducted Sophie Giroux and Alice Webster. 
 You're saying he framed my husband? 
 You're dying. 
 You're lost, my love, and the tide is coming in. 
 Mummy! 
 Lucy! 
 Gettrick knows I suspect him. 
 If I'm right, he knows I have seen him for who he is and he'll already be gone. 
 You can have this if you're good. 
 You will be good... won't you, Alice? 
 I'll be good. 
 Where's Baptiste? 
 He's upstairs. 
 He's trying to see if there's anything Adam left behind to show us where he went. 
 Well, if you've found something, you should be calling the police, not me. 
 Yeah. Just come and look, Sam. 
 What is it? 
 Look. 
 There. 
 Do you remember when you told her you couldn't get the time off work to go camping? 
 How much she cried? 
 And then the minute she left for school, you went straight up to her room and you put up all those stars for her. 
 Kept her quiet about camping for about a day. 
 The pattern's the same, Sam. 
 It can't be a coincidence, can it? 
 You're going to be OK. 
 You'll get better, you'll see. 
 You just need to try and drink something. 
 Please, Sophie, you HAVE to drink something. Just try. 
 The day I arrived, he threw me down here and I was crying. 
 You didn't tell me everything was going to be OK. 
 You said that you didn't know. 
 You said that you were scared, just like I was. 
 But you promised that you'd be here, no matter what, for as long as you could. 
 That's all you COULD promise. 
 Well, I'm here, Sophie. 
 I'm still here. 
 What were you talking about? 
 And what are you doing out of your corner? 
 You know I can see everything you do down here, don't you? 
 What were you saying to her? 
 If you don't do something, she's going to die. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 I'm doing everything I can. 
 She's in too much pain to eat. She needs the hospital... 
 Get back in your place. 
 You want to end up like Lena? 
 Then don't EVER tell me what to do again. 
 It should be you, not Sophie, that's like this. 
 Why can't you behave, Alice? 
 Why is it you still don't understand how to behave and shut that ugly mouth of yours? 
 You can hit me all you want. 
 But if you don't do something, she's going to die! 
 What are you going to tell Lucy? 
 How are you going to tell her that you let her mummy die? 
 ♪ Oh, my love ♪ 
♪ We pray each day ♪ 
♪ May you come home ♪ 
♪ And be OK ♪ 
♪ For now we wait ♪ 
♪ For you, for you ♪ 
♪ To come home. ♪ 
 Adam. 
 Interesting choice of venue. 
 You all right? 
 I'm in trouble. 
 OK. 
 I can't help you unless you tell me what kind of trouble. 
 You know when we went for a drink at that bierhaus last Wednesday? 
 You, me and Henry. 
 I do. 
 We talked about Iraq. 
 Henry got angry and stormed off. 
 He really hated being reminded of that night... 
 Get to the point. 
 I recorded our conversation. 
 You and Henry discussing everything, and after Henry went, we talked about other things, didn't we? 
 About the girls we were with back then. 
 Are you blackmailing me? 
 No. 
 No, no, no, we're friends. 
 We go back a long way. 
 I simply... I want you to understand... 
 I protected you when no-one else would. 
 I saved your life, you ungrateful little sh1t! 
 I don't want to hurt you, Adrian, but you're not going to want to do what I'm going to ask you. 
 (I really need you to.) 
 If there was any other way... 
 I've tried everything. 
 What do you want? 
 What exactly have you done, Adam? 
 I'm just saying, once you know, you know. 
 No point in messing about, and that's all I'm saying. 
 Yeah, but I don't know. 
 How do you ever know? 
 A leap of faith. 
 Oh, cos that worked out for you and Mum? 
 I'm not saying it always worked out, OK? 
 Why are you in such a hurry for me to get married? 
 I'm not. 
 I just think it would be nice knowing that you're settled. 
 OK, so what about you? 
 Are you seriously going to tell me that massive Christmas present in the corner is just for a mate? 
 Come on, what's her name? 
 Saved by the bell. Excuse me. 
 Mobile, Dad. Seriously, we've got to get you a mobile phone. 
 Henry Reed. 
 Now? 
 Um... OK, OK. 
 Fine. 
 Can't you just tell me... 
 No. 
 I understand. 
 Dad, I've got to go. 
 I got to dash, I'm sorry, but I'll see you next week, yeah? 
 This time next week, yeah. 
 What are we doing here? 
 What's done is done. 
 You believe that, don't you? 
 "The past cannot be cured" you ever heard that? 
 There's no point dwelling on what's happened. 
 If we did, you, me, and Adam, we wouldn't be here today. 
 We can't go back and fix things. 
 Tell me why I'm here. 
 Before we go in... Adam has us. 
 He has a recording, what happened in Iraq. 
 Just remember that he has us saying everything we did. 
 Henry, we served our country with honour. 
 We put our lives on the line. 
 Imagine if the only thing we're remembered for in our lives is that one horrific f*cking night! 
 She's dying, Henry. 
 I need you to make her better. 
 Is this all you've found? 
 I have searched as thoroughly as I can without disturbing the scene. 
 But, Mr Webster, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. 
 You're a detective. 
 Why can't you call the police, tell them to find Adam? 
 I have no special power in this regard. 
 The police here do not trust me. 
 Their involvement will only slow us down. The man left quickly. 
 Time is of the essence. 
 WE must find Adam Gettrick. 
 How? 
 We hope he left something behind. 
 I've been trying to get hold of Detective Lenhart for two days. 
 It's very important that I speak to him. 
 He sent me an SMS the other day, saying he needed to go away. 
 I covered for him, saying he is ill. 
 Get away where? 
 You know Lenhart, right? 
 Off writing songs and poetry probably. 
 He was looking into something for me. 
 Do you mind if I check his desk? 
 Maybe you'd prefer that I tell your boss you're covering for Detective Lenhart? 
 Look at this. 
 Baptiste! 
 Yes. 
 You've found something? 
 Swiss francs. 
 Wait a second. 
 This was taken in Switzerland. 
 A man like Adam Gettrick, to keep his crimes hidden for so long, he would have anticipated an eventuality like this. 
 He would have a contingency. 
 I have a friend at Interpol. 
 He will explore this connection to Switzerland. 
 Mark Walsh! How is the new job? 
 I have a favour to ask, my friend. 
 If Gettrick's gone to Switzerland, we might've already lost him. 
 Baptiste knows what he's doing. 
 He's been right so far, hasn't he, about everything? 
 No, not everything. 
 Not about Alice. 
 It seems that Adam Gettrick's uncle is on the electoral roll in Switzerland, in a small town called Vaaren. 
 We don't know the exact address, only the area, but it's better than nothing. 
 We could be there by morning. 
 Go back to sleep. 
 Did you get anything? 
 I said I'd take care of you. 
 We're going to be happy here, Sophie. Just you see. 
 I've tried all I can. 
 I've looked it up. I think it might be her appendix. 
 She's got a fever. There's a pain in her side. 
 You were a medic for ten years. There must be something you can do. 
 No. 
 No, I... don't want any part of this. 
 If you don't help her, the girl will die. 
 Her temperature is off the charts, the pain is getting worse. 
 Now you can do something to help. 
 Adrian, call the police! 
 For Christ's sake, Henry! 
 Call them the police now! 
 He has us admitting what we did. 
 So? 
 Maybe people deserve to know the truth. 
 Because of us... that little girl died. 
 I'm not going to make the same mistake again. 
 No. 
 I love Sophie and you're going to help me make her better. 
 Adrian... 
 Come on. 
 Jesus, Adrian, please! 
 All you need to do is help her. 
 The only help that girl needs is surgery. 
 Fine, then that's what we'll do. 
 She needs a hospital! 
 No! 
 Right here. 
 I'll, um... 
 I'll need my medical kit. 
 I have to go. I've a garrison dinner. 
 Oh, well, I'm sorry to be keeping you(!) 
 If I don't go, there'll be questions. 
 If I was going to call the police, I'd have done it by now. 
 You've got a chance to do the right thing, Adrian. 
 You've finally got a chance to do the right thing. 
 Come on. 
 If she doesn't get surgery in hospital, she will die. 
 Have you been drinking? 
 What the hell's that got to do with anything? 
 We can't risk being stopped. I'll drive. 
 Kit's in the office. 
 sh1t! 
 Er, I wasn't thinking. 
 It's next door. The medical kit's next door. 
 I really am sorry, Henry. 
 I did not want this to happen. 
 I'm just trying to help her. 
 That's all. 
 I just... 
 You're not well, Sophie. 
 I know how much pain you must be in. 
 But the medicine I've given you is going to get you through this... 
 I promise. 
 You know Alice inside out. 
 Don't you? 
 You look like her. 
 Even down to the tattoo she did for you. Like hers. 
 You know her better than even her parents did. 
 And now... 
 I need you to be her. 
 What... What do you mean? 
 Just until you're better. 
 I'm letting you go, Sophie. 
 'Just enough time to get you to the hospital. To get treatment. I can't bear the thought of you dying. But I can't risk taking you myself, so you'll have to push past the pain. Alice.' 
 I don't understand that... 
 Everything is prepared. 
 If you're going out there, out into the world, there are people who want to try and take you away. 
 If they find out you really are, they would take you back to France, away from me, away from Lucy. 
 This way's safer. 
 'If they think you're Alice, you'll stay here. Close by. They'll never believe me. Well, why not? You even sound like her now. And you know what?' 
 Alice's parents want her back. 
 And sometimes that's all it takes. 
 So when they ask you, you tell them this man took you. 
 Look at him. 
 Remember him. 
 Who is he? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 All that matters is that you do as I tell you. 
 Just do what we talked about and you can come home to us. 
 Back to Lucy. You just have to be a good girl. 
 You will be a good girl, won't you? 
 Yes. 
 You remember what happened to Lena? 
 You wouldn't want that to happen to Lucy? 
 No. You be a good girl. 
 And when you're better, we can be a family again. 
 Not now, Adam. 
 It's happening, Adrian. 
 I don't want anything to do with it. 
 Well, you're part of it. It's just the way it is. 
 If people start asking questions or they want to do a DNA test, I will need you to step in. 
 They need to know it's Alice. 
 I understand. 
 
 
 
 Dad! 
 Oh! 
 Why'd you want to meet me here? 
 I.. was... at the doctor's down the road there, and I just... 
 Well, I just ended up sitting here. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Ever since you were young, you followed in my footsteps. 
 Joining the army, climbing the ranks, even getting into country music. 
 Your mother always said it was because you looked up to me, but I always knew that wasn't it. 
 It... 
 It was just... that we were so similar, so much like the same person... and I... I'm sorry about that! 
 I've been a good dad, haven't I? 
 Dad... 
 I want you to remember me as a good dad, as the man who indulged you, who pushed you so high on the swing your mother nearly had an aneurysm. 
 You remember that, don't you? 
 Of course I do. 
 It's that... soon I won't remember that. 
 Soon, I... I might not even remember you. 
 There'll be pieces missing, the doctor said, parts of me that fall away. 
 But even if I can't remember you, love, please, whatever happens, what anyone says, if ever... 
 Remember me for the good things. 
 Baptiste. 
 Julien. 
 I thought you should know, the picture Mrs Webster found, the rollercoaster, Jorn Lenhart looked into it and he found another abducted girl. 
 Lena Garber. 
 I spoke to her mother this morning. 
 She'd spoken to Jorn the other day about a friend of the family. 
 Adam Gettrick. 
 Adam was involved. You were right. 
 I wish I was able to feel joy that you've joined me at this conclusion, but that's not the case, because Jorn now is missing and Adam Gettrick is free. 
 I can't help thinking that... if you're right about this, maybe you've been right about other things. 
 You must remove yourself from your own feeling to see something as it truly is. 
 Your father's not the man you thought him to be. 
 Looks like we're nearly there. 
 Is that Sam Webster? Where are you? 
 Switzerland. Looking for Mr Gettrick. 
 No, Julien, stay where you are. 
 Gettrick could be dangerous. I'll contact the Swiss police. 
 If I'd listened to you up till this moment, Staff Sergeant Stone, we wouldn't be where we are. 
 Engel, it's Eve. 
 I need your help tracking a phone. 
 Yeah, Julien Baptiste. 
 Hello. 
 Bonjour. 
 Have you seen her? 
 Have you seen him? 
 Merci. 
 Merci. 
 Hi. Good afternoon. I'm looking for this man. 
 Adam Gettrick. I still can't get my head round it. 
 I know. 
 He's one of us. Y'know, I know him. 
 How can one of your own do something like this? 
 Look, you saw those stars in that basement, Sam. 
 You know that Julien was right about Adam. 
 But how do you know that he's not right about Alice? 
 That she might not still be alive? 
 Wanting something to be true doesn't make it true, Gem. 
 But you must wonder. All the differences. 
 Y'know -- the way she was when she came back. 
 I don't know. 
 What happened to us, Sam? 
 We managed -- we struggled on for 11 years after she was taken. 
 What were we doing, just fooling ourselves that it could all just go back to how it was before she went? 
 We got through it then because I loved you. 
 You and Matthew and Alice... and I still do. 
 That didn't stop. 
 Hey. 
 None of this is real. 
 Any of it. 
 You are here. That's all that matters. 
 You are opening yourself to possibility. 
 Thank you. You didn't need to. 
 It's all part of the service. Here you go. 
 Hey, hold on. 
 This woman... do you know her? 
 Yeah. She was here the other day. 
 What? 
 I mean, she looked different, she had shorter hair. 
 I was stupid enough to ask for her phone number -- way out of my league, you know... 
 You saw her here? 
 Yeah. 
 That's not possible. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Where did she go when she left? 
 There's a footbridge on the way out of town, it crosses the river... she went into the woods. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on, Gemma. 
 Sometimes Hilde speaks. 
 How could he have seen her? It doesn't make sense. 
 It's OK. 
 What is it? 
 Stay here. 
 In the disappearance of Sophie Giroux, there was one clue. 
 A camper van spotted nearby. 
 The number plate is from Germany. 
 What do you think's through there? 
 We'll soon find out. 
 Hey, wait. Sergeant Stone is sending help. We must be cautious. 
 Adam Gettrick is a dangerous man. 
 We've come this far. 
 And if he is up there, he'll know we're here already, won't he? 
 I need to know what happened to our daughter, and Gettrick's going to tell me. 
 This ends now. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 We've learned a great deal already. 
 We don't need to rush now. 
 Hey, there's a path, this way. 
 Argh! 
 Julien?! 
 Sam? 
 Sam!! Sam! 
 Sam! 
 Sam, Sam! Sam! 
 Shut her up. Get her to stop that noise! 
 Shut her up! 
 Lucy! Lucy, I told you to... 
 What, you... 
 I told you to keep her quiet! 
 Lucy? Lucy? Where's she gone? Where's she...? 
 Go. Go find her! 
 If they take her, it's on your head! 
 Lucy! 
 Lucy! 
 Lucy! 
 Lucy! 
 Lucy! 
 Sophie! 
 Sophie, stop! Stop! 
 Help! Can you help us, please? 
 Arrgh! 
 Put your hands behind your back! 
 It's my family! 
 Hands behind your back now! 
 They're my family! 
 What did you do? 
 Sophie. 
 They've taken her. 
 No. She's safe. That's all. 
 It's over. I'll never be allowed to see her. 
 No! Whatever he told you, no-one will take your daughter from you. 
 You're a liar! 
 You're a liar like the rest of them. They're my family. 
 Without them, I'm nothing. 
 There are people who care about you, Sophie. 
 They don't know me. You don't know me. 
 I know what will happen if you step forwards. 
 It'll be a waste of a life. 
 Sophie. 
 I couldn't save your mother. 
 I told her things would get better. What kind of platitude is this? 
 I don't know what kind of life you can return to, but think what you leave behind if you jump. 
 Your father, your little daughter. 
 Think what kind of life you're making for them if you do this! 
 Stop! Stop. Stop. 
 Is it her? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. It's her, Sam. 
 She's alive. 
 I was wrong. 
 Mum! 
 I've got you. 
 I've got you now. 
 Stay! 
 We have no time to lose, sir. 
 Please. You have lost a lot of blood. 
 We really must get you to a hospital right away. 
 Alice! 
 The body, in the shed. 
 Whose was it? 
 It wasn't Alice Webster. It wasn't Sophie Giroux. 
 That was a third girl, wasn't it, Mr Gettrick? 
 A girl by the name of Lena Garber? 
 Jorn Lenhart figured out you had taken Ms Garber, didn't he? 
 And you killed him because of this. 
 You've got a wife, haven't you? Do you love her? 
 You'd do anything for the ones you love, wouldn't you? 
 To protect them, to keep them safe. 
 Don't pretend what you had with these poor girls was anything like love. 
 Tell me about Lena Garber. 
 Well, she was always difficult. 
 I mean, Alice was difficult, but she knew when to shut up. 
 But Lena... 
 She was like this constant ringing in your ears. 
 So... one night I shut her up. 
 When? 
 Just as Sophie got ill. That's what gave me the idea. 
 I put her body in the shed the night I let Sophie out. 
 Cos if they had a body, no-one would come and look for her again. 
 We could be a family. Just a normal family. 
 Adrian Stone could mess with the DNA. 
 Swap them out so they looked like a match. 
 You made Sophie pretend she was Alice Webster, just to keep her close. 
 The name Sophie Giroux was never supposed to be mentioned, but she wasn't well. 
 She told the paramedics in the ambulance her real name. 
 And Kristian Herz? 
 I barely know the man. 
 His wife, though... 
 When I broke into their house to get his camera... 
 I was going to slit her ignorant throat where she was sleeping. 
 But then I thought... 
 "After what you let me go through... 
 "No, that is almost too good for you." 
 You put a great deal of thought into this. 
 It's like you said the last time we met -- 
 I'm not a stupid man. 
 How many other girls were there, Mr Gettrick? 
 What makes you think there's any more? 
 A feeling. 
 A feeling I wish I didn't have. 
 Dad, it's me, Eve. 
 They're saying you're well enough. 
 Well enough to go home. They need the beds. 
 But are you well, Dad? Are you? 
 What... 
 What do you want? 
 I want you to tell me who you are. 
 I want you to be honest with me. 
 I want you to tell me... what it is you did. 
 Darling? 
 You said to remember you for the good things. 
 Why did you say that? 
 Because you knew it was going to come out? 
 I'm sorry! 
 I'm sorry... 
 I don't know what I'm doing here. 
 I don't know where I am. 
 Is he going to the care home? 
 No. 
 He's coming with me. 
 Hey... Lucy. 
 I am your grand-papa. 
 Do you... Do you like magic? 
 Yeah? 
 For you. 
 He loved you so much, you know that? 
 I know. 
 She's doing really well. Alice. 
 It amazes me how strong she is. 
 You are keeping it, aren't you? 
 Do you know... 
 It's a girl. 
 I can't wait to meet her. 
 Everything will be fine. 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry for what I've done. 
 If there is a God, he knows my heart. He knows how sorry I am. 
 I have been a foolish old man, afraid to die just because I still have so much to live for. 
 Now stop trying to buy yourself more time. 
 Let's get this over with. 
 Dix. Neuf. Huit. Sept... Six... cinq... quatre... trois...
