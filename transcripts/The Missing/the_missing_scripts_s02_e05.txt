 This programme contains some violent scenes and scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. 
 Alice is dead. Initial reports suggest she started the fire. She killed herself. 
 The DNA results are back on the remains in the shed. 
 We ran them against your husband. It's a confirmed match with your daughter. 
 It's really Alice? 
 I'm sorry. 
 She asked me. 
 She begged me. 
 It's not Matthew's fault that this happened. 
 He knows what he's done. 
 You both do. 
 Who is this man - Henry Reed? 
 Why did she need to see him before she took her own life? 
 Henry Reed made those payments out of guilt for what they did to my sister. 
 Henry Reed and his army friend. 
 A man called "Stone". 
 She always wanted a family. 
 It hit her hard, you know? 
 Why can't you just leave us alone?! Calm down. 
 Oh! 
 You know what I said, earlier on, about not seeing something that's right in front of you? 
 Well, I was right. 
 There was another girl. 
 (Bell tolls) 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Sorry. 
 English, yeah? Yeah. What do you want? 
 This... 
 You left it at the cafe. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry for earlier. 
 I talk too much when I'm nervous. 
 Some people fall silent, some go red, some will sweat - I talk. 
 It's completely foolish, of course. 
 What is there to be nervous of? 
 Just talking to another person... 
 I'm doing it all over again. Sorry. 
 Thanks for this.

 Ja, ich verstehe. Ja, vielen dank. 
 Ja, auf wiedersehen. 
 The desk NCO says Sergeant Stone is not available. 
 A medical issue, they said. 
 I hope everything is OK with the baby. 
 They did not disclose any more. 
 I feel we should at least talk to her, it's her case. 
 Well, if you wish to see her, I understand, of course. 
 No. 
 No, it's not that. It's just... 
 Forgive me. Pretend I didn't say it. 
 Well, we're almost there. 
 Henry Reed's body was found here. 
 One shot, into his mouth. 
 The gun in his right hand. 
 Forensics all supported Sergeant Stone's conclusion. 
 He killed himself. 
 But no indication of why. 
 Sometimes, there are not. 
 Sometimes... 
 What are you thinking? 
 A British Army officer kills himself. 
 A few days later, an English girl, Iong thought missing, returns. 
 She goes to the grave of the Army officer before she sets herself on fire. 
 Do you believe in coincidence, Jorn? 
 "Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous." 
 A policeman who quotes Einstein. 
 You're a rare breed. 
 Well, if there's a connection, I cannot imagine what it could be. 
 Henry Reed. 
 Does he have any family? 
 Any loved ones in Germany? 
 His son. 
 He's a trooper on the base. 
 Daniel Reed. 
 Well, I think, perhaps, in the morning, we should talk to Daniel Reed. 
 So, your notes say you have placenta praevia... 
 ..and, yes, I can see... 
 ..the placenta is very low in the womb. 
 With this condition, some vaginal bleeding can sometimes occur. 
 But do you think it was the fall that caused it? 
 It's nothing to be alarmed about. 
 But still, I'd like to keep you in overnight. 
 Are you worried about the baby? 
 No. 
 Not worried. 
 Only... the baby's heart rate is a little faster than I would like, so we'll keep you on the monitor to see if the girl settles down, OK? 
 Good morning. 
 Looks like we are going to spend Christmas Eve together. 
 And here I am, with nothing to give you. 
 Daniel Reed hasn't reported in for duty. 
 (Intercom buzzes) 
 Hallo? Marlene Loweich? 
 Ja. Ja, Polizei. 
 Wir wurden gerne mit ihnen uber Daniel Reed sprechen. 
 Ja. 
 (Intercom buzzes) 
 Danke. 
 Guten morgen. Durfen wir hereinkommen? 
 Ja. 
 (Oven beeps) 
 Wow. 
 Wow, it smells wonderful. 
 I'm training to become a chef. 
 You certainly have enough saucepans to qualify. 
 What is this about? 
 Daniel Reed. 
 He's your boyfriend, no? 
 Yes. 
 Well, he was... 
 ..until yesterday morning, anyway. 
 What happened yesterday morning? 
 I woke up and he was gone. 
 Just like that. 
 Did he say why? 
 These last few months, even before his father died, Daniel was very distant. 
 And then, when Henry took his own life, he... he fell further. 
 (Smoke alarm blares) 
 Oh, scheisse. 
 Another failure. 
 No, it will only be a failure if you stop trying. 
 Right now, it's experience. 
 Daniel started to think that his father did not kill himself. 
 He became paranoid. 
 He started to talk about Iraq. 
 He became obsessed with it, with this period that his father's life spent there. 
 What happened there? 
 I don't know, he doesn't know, but it seemed very important to him. 
 Did he ever mention Alice Webster or perhaps a girl called Sophie Giroux? 
 No. 
 No. What could Daniel have had to do with them? 
 Well, we don't know. 
 We are as in the dark as you are right now, but... if you think of anything, anything at all, any news of Daniel, if you hear from him, please... call me any time. 
 Wherever the hell he has gone, they can have him. 
 It's their problem now. 
 (Car unlocks) 
 (Plane flies overhead) 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello? 
 IN FRENCH: How are you? 
 I'm fine, but... 
 I'm tired. 
 It was a long flight. 
 I'm back in Germany. 
 OK. 
 Enough, Julien. 
 This is enough. 
 You're ill. 
 You have a tumour. 
 You have to understand that, if you do nothing, you will die. 
 That's the choice you're making. 
 I have to be here. 
 Why? 
 Why can't somebody else do it? 
 Why can't you just let it bloody go? 
 Celia... 
 (She sobs) 
 That is Alice's necklace. 
 With the bird, I recognise it. 
 We found it in the shed, after your daughter... 
 It doesn't mean it's the same one. 
 Alice was wearing it when she went missing. 
 That third girl, maybe she...? 
 Forward me the photo and I'll look into it. 
 What will you do? 
 I promise, Gemma, I'll do everything I can to find out... who this girl is. 
 Me and Sam, it... 
 Me and Sam, it's over. 
 We both knew it wasn't right. 
 I think, maybe... 
 Maybe if you talked to him, about Alice... 
 Have you showed him this picture? 
 Oh, no. 
 It's not my place. No. 
 No, it's not. 
 I'll let you know if I find anything. 
 (She knocks) 
 Eve. 
 Nice to see you. 
 Gemma Webster says you've been helping her out with something. 
 She thinks that girl... is her real daughter, that she's Alice. 
 And Mrs Webster thinks that this girl, at the back... 
 ..she's wearing Alice's necklace. 
 Well, it's a coincidence, a girl with the same necklace. 
 Unless Kristian Herz took another girl. 
 It's possible. 
 Maybe we should look into reports of other missing girls. 
 Well, I will do everything I can... but I must ask, what does Mrs Webster expect to find? 
 Her daughter. 
 Her daughter is dead. 
 I know, but I promised her. 
 Look, if there's anything I can do, any way I can help, just... 
 Iet me know. 
 Wait... 
 I've got something for you. 
 Wait. 
 This is for you. 
 It's a song. 
 A song? 
 What's that got to do with the case? 
 Nothing, it's just, I... 
 You know, I wrote it and... 
 Yeah, I should have said that. 
 I thought you might like it and... you know, you have a CD player in your car, and then... 
 Thanks. 
 You need a hand? 
 (She scoffs) 
 I've heard it all now. 
 Gem, I need to tell you something. 
 I should've told you before, it's not fair on you. 
 There's someone... 
 Well, some things don't need to be said out loud, do they? 
 It just... 
 ..makes it real, doesn't it? 
 And I think we've suffered enough, don't you? 
 I keep thinking about what the doc said, about a place for me back in England, for us. 
 There's nothing for me here now, not any more, is there? 
 Well, we've talked about this. Our lives are here. 
 Pushing papers around on a desk, three days a week. 
 Compulsory bloody therapy... 
 That's not why I signed up. 
 We need something to change. 
 Well, what about Matthew? 
 He's 23. Well, we can't leave him behind, can we? 
 I thought, after what happened a few months ago, that things would be different, but he's never going to forgive me - so you could talk to him for us. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, fine. 
 I'm sorry. 
 These are his favourite. 
 And these. 
 When he liked something, he'd buy two. 
 I got that off him. 
 (Knock on door) 
 Visit for you, Miss Stone. 
 Right. 
 Baptiste. 
 Sergeant. 
 Staff Sergeant now. 
 Staff Sergeant. Forgive me. 
 How are you? 
 Alive. 
 I've been in Northern Iraq. 
 I went to find Daniel Reed, Henry Reed's son. 
 Why? 
 The girl who came back... 
 Alice... she knew Henry Reed. 
 The day before she set light to herself inside that shed, she laid flowers on his grave. 
 Baptiste... 
 ..this is over. 
 Kristian Herz is rotting in prison for the abduction of Alice Webster, the same girl who ID'd him. 
 What more do you want? 
 Information. 
 Information I think your father will be able to help me with. 
 My father needs help putting his bloody socks on. 
 What possible help could he be? 
 If it wasn't important, I wouldn't ask. 
 He's not well. 
 Tell me your questions and I'll ask them. 
 Look, I feel it would be better if I was around... 
 Those are the terms. 
 It's not a negotiation. 
 I need to ask your father about his time in the Gulf War. 
 Why? 
 Because it's connected to the abductions of Alice and Sophie. 
 What do you mean? 
 Your father killed a girl in Iraq. 
 Not in battle. 
 He murdered a civilian child. 
 Killed a girl? 
 I have it on good authority... 
 "Good authority?" 
 Whose bloody authority? 
 Authority to accuse an old man with Alzheimer's... 
 ..of murdering a child?! 
 The man who told me, he has no reason to lie. 
 The pieces fit. 
 Leave. 
 Right now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's hard to find out the ones you love are not who you thought they were. 
 (She retches) 
 Dad, I have to go. 
 Hm? 
 I'm going to go. I'll be back, OK? 
 Are we going home? 
 This is... 
 This is your home now, OK? 
 I'll be back. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Look at this number. 
 The day Henry Reed died, there were several calls to this number. 
 In the rest of the phone records, you can see more calls. 
 Only at weekends, late at night. 
 So, we must find out who he was talking to. 
 Ja, guten tag. Mein name ist Jorn Lenhart, Polizei Eckhausen. 
 Ich wollte gerne mit ihnen uber einen Englander sprechen, er heisst Henry Reed... 
 Hallo? 
 They hung up. 
 Can you trace the number? 
 I would be most interested to learn why they are reluctant to talk to us. 
 The burns, we will have to wait. 
 Give the skin a chance to heal, assess the damage, then we can consider our options... but there will be extensive scarring. 
 How is your pain? 
 Fine. When can I go home? 
 We'd like to monitor you for the next few hours... but, all being well, the end of the day. 
 In time for Christmas. 
 Thanks. 
 I hate this place. 
 Gem... 
 (Knock on door) 
 Mr and Mrs Webster, I'm sorry to intrude. 
 It's a time-sensitive matter, I was hoping I could have a word with you, if that's OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Christ, this is the last thing you need right now. 
 What is it? 
 There is a French news outlet who's got hold of a story that they want me to comment on. 
 They said they have got independent sources... telling them your son, Matthew, Iocked Alice in the shed, before she... 
 They're planning to publish. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, we need to talk to them. 
 We need to set the record straight. 
 Why should we? 
 It's true, isn't it? 
 Why should we lie for him? 
 Christ, Sam. 
 Tell them we'll do it. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's just cramps again. 
 I'll find a doctor. No, no. 
 They keep checking on me every 30 minutes, I'm sure it's nothing. 
 If you want to help... get them to turn that bloody music off. 
 If I hear one more Christmas song, I'll kill someone. 
 (She wails) 
 God! 
 (She screams) 
 (She sobs) : Why am I here? 
 You know why you're here. 
 You know why you did this. 
 All night, I couldn't sleep. 
 I just kept thinking, "What if something's wrong with the baby?" 
 Then we'll deal with it. 
 Your sister's on the way. 
 Try not to worry. 
 Everything's going to be fine. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I'm your dad and I said so. 
 (She groans) 
 This is ridiculous, I'm getting a doctor. 
 Doctor! Doktor! Meine Tochter braucht Hilfe. Sie hat Schmerzen. 
 Sofort! 
 (She speaks in German) 
 
 
 
 It's all right, love, here's the doctor. You'll be fine now. 
 It's just cramp. It's just cramp. 
 Just let me have a quick look. 
 Schwester! Lassen Sie einen OP fertig machen, sofort! 
 What? You have a placental abruption. 
 The lining of the placenta's coming away from the wall of the uterus. 
 The baby? The baby? 
 The heart rate is not what we would like. 
 An anaesthetist will put in an epidural, and we will be performing an emergency Caesarean. 
 But you'll be OK. You'll be fine. 
 Don't worry. I'm right here. 
 I'm right here. 
 Give me your hand, that's it, don't worry. 
 I'm right by you, I'm right by you. 
 Your birth was difficult, but your mother got through it. 
 Tell me. 
 Well, it was... The hospital was... 
 It was... 
 The hospital was near... 
 The hospital... 
 But you're here now. That's all that matters. 
 And your little one will be fine, too. Don't worry. Don't worry. 
 You'll be fine. 
 This is Monsieur Soumier, and Mr and Mrs Webster. 
 Guillaume, please. 
 Shall we sit down? 
 Thank you for sitting down with me, especially with your injuries. 
 That's fine. 
 As you might have been told, a source has given some information. 
 Now, I only wish to print the truth. 
 We are not one of those papers that like to... make sensational stories, you know? 
 Good. 
 I was told that your boy, Matthew, he locked your girl in the shed in which she took her own life. 
 The lock's been broken on that shed ever since we moved in. 
 It's one of those jobs you think you'll get round to, and never do, you know? 
 Like the corner of the carpet coming up, so I don't know where you got that from but it's wrong. 
 And you can't go printing things that aren't true, can you? 
 I understand. Only, my source was quite specific... 
 Yeah, well, they're wrong. 
 He's a good lad. 
 Dad! 
 How is she? 
 In surgery. 
 But look, your sister's strong. She'll get through this. 
 Her and the baby. Don't you worry. 
 OK, I will spray your stomach. 
 Tell me if you feel a cold sensation.

 Danke. 
 Of all the places I thought I'd be this Christmas Eve, this was low on the list. 
 But still on the list? Hm? 
 Wolfgang Hausler? 
 Merci. 
 Vous parlez Francais? 
 English? 
 Oh... 
 That is The Three Ages Of Man And Death, no? 
 You know Hans Baldung? 
 My wife loves art. Did you paint this? 
 Between clients. It relaxes me. 
 It's so close to the real thing. 
 Much like me, then. 
 Close, but still not quite the real thing. 
 Have you any of your own work? 
 I have yet to find my own style, you know? 
 It's impressive. 
 What is it you want? I'm assuming it's not my services. 
 We are investigating the death of Henry Reed. You knew him? 
 I didn't realise he was dead. He was a client. 
 He called you the night he died, several times. 
 The night of the 14th December. 
 Last time I spoke to Henry... 
 Yes. He wanted to see me. 
 Obviously, I mean, look at me! 
 I couldn't. 
 He wanted me to come to his house, but I couldn't. 
 I was booked up for the night. 
 That is all that passed? 
 That's all. 
 Did he mean anything to you? Henry Reed? 
 If every dead body you detectives came across meant something to you, you would never get out of bed in the morning. 
 No. 
 This job, like yours, there's no room for these kinds of emotions. 
 My job is looking for missing children. 
 So we shall have to agree to disagree on this point. 
 I understand. We'll leave you in peace. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 Sir... my name is Julien Baptiste. We met almost two years ago. 
 Do you remember? 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 I was on the garrison, here in Eckhausen. 
 It was back when the girl, Alice Webster, returned. 
 Memory is a complicated thing. 
 Sometimes, a sound, a smell... 
 They can conjure us into places we'd forgotten about as if we were there. 
 What time is it? Is it time to leave? 
 Is the car here? 
 In a moment. We can wait here for the car. 
 The heat in Iraq... 
 ..it's different, no? 
 To any other kind of heat. 
 It was so dry. 
 A heat that sucked all the life from your mouth. 
 You imagine those places to be barren, hostile. 
 But there are people there. 
 Living their life just like you and I. 
 Empty Coca-Cola bottles on the street. 
 Car horns, always, a constant din. 
 And the light... 
 I know what happened there. 
 Mirza Barzani told me. 
 I know you killed that girl. 
 So tell me - tell me about Alice Webster. 
 Tell me about Sophie Giroux. 
 When are we going? We should be leaving now, shouldn't we? 
 We will. Your things are packed. 
 We are going soon. 
 Do you know him? 
 That's Henry's boy. 
 Daniel. 
 He looks just like his father. 
 You and Henry Reed, you were in Iraq together, many years ago. 
 What the three of us did to that poor girl... 
 The three of you? 
 Who was the third person? 
 Which girl? 
 Are you talking about Alice Webster? 
 We should be home by now. 
 We cannot go right now. 
 Don't tell me what we can and can't do! 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Please, stay with me... 
 Know your place, soldier! 
 Was tun Sie hier? 
 It's fine, it's fine... 
 Verlassen Sie sofort die Station. 
 Sofort. 
 What are you doing? 
 It's late. You should get up. 
 Your dad's been offered a new position. Back home. 
 This is home. I have friends here. 
 Yeah, they're not the right kind of friends, though, are they? 
 That's not up to you. 
 Well, isn't it worth thinking about? 
 Do you want to go? 
 Oh... Maybe your dad's right, maybe we all need a fresh start. 
 You think that'll fix things? 
 Matthew, your dad loves you. 
 He got put on medical leave for you. 
 Yeah, and then... 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, we can't carry on like this. 
 So go. What's keeping you here? 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello? 
 'I spoke to Matthew.' 
 He doesn't want to go back to England. 
 So, what, he's decided for us? 
 England could be a new start for us, couldn't it? 
 'What, you think a change of scenery can just tear up the last two years? It's not that simple. Sam, wherever we go, we'll still be us.' 
 We need to try and sort it, don't we? 
 We can fix this. 
 It's not just Matthew. 
 It's me, it's me, too. I'm not ready to go. 
 When you come back there's something I want to show you. 
 'All right. I won't be long. I love you.' 
 OK. 
 Sam. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Didn't you get my messages? 
 I thought we said we weren't going to see each other, that that was for the best. 
 I'm bloody pregnant. 
 Sweetheart... 
 How are you feeling? 
 Awful. 
 I think she's asleep now. 
 Do you want to hold her? 
 No, it's OK. 
 I don't know how we can ever thank you, Eve. 
 Just don't ask me to make her a younger brother. 
 Being pregnant once was definitely enough. 
 Maybe next Christmas. 
 Adopt a dog next time. 
 All right. Let's allow your sister to get some sleep. 
 Don't go. 
 I like listening to you all. 
 (Baby cries) 
 Do you think this will make any difference? 
 I think Ilsa knows more than she's saying. 
 And we have to delve a little deeper to know what it is. 
 (Knocking) 
 Again? I have a client in five minutes. 
 This will not take so long. We wanted to bring you something. 
 I told you all I know. Bringing gifts will make no difference. 
 May we come in? 
 Open it. 
 It's nice. 
 We found it in Henry Reed's house. 
 No note, but... am I wrong to think it was for you? 
 A Christmas present? 
 Henry always was extravagant. 
 To you, perhaps, he was just another client, but he cared for you, it seems, in his way. 
 I do not think you are guilty. 
 If I did, I would come here with more than an artist's easel. 
 But I do think you're holding back. 
 I am not saying this is what happened, yes? 
 But imagine Henry called me that night. 
 Imagine if I went to his house. 
 I would always wait outside until I saw his car pull up in the driveway. 
 Only when I saw him go in would I follow. 
 Neighbours, you know? What would they think? 
 That night, I waited outside Henry's house... 
 Hypothetically, of course. 
 I waited. 
 'For an hour, I waited. But his car did not show. Finally, I grew tired. "Damn the neighbours," is what I thought.' 
 (Knocking) 
 Henry, it's Ilsa. 
 'The door was open. And then I saw him.' 
 Lying in the living room. 
 'I ran, OK?' 
 I know how this looks. Someone like me, in this man's house, I would be blamed. 
 I believe you. 
 And tell me, are you sure the car was not there? 
 Positive. I waited long enough. 
 The police report says the car was found outside his house. 
 Somebody moved the car later. When he was already dead. 
 Making suicide unlikely, no? 
 Thank you for your help. 
 If he was murdered... and you find out... 
 We will tell you. 
 Hey. 
 How are you doing? 
 They discharged me, so... 
 You're not getting a cab back, are you? 
 Gemma's bringing the car round. 
 Was it a boy or a girl? 
 Girl. 
 Where is she? 
 She's with my sister. 
 I was a surrogate, for her and her husband, so now I have the stretch-marks and hormones of a new mum but none of the responsibility. 
 Sorry. I didn't know. 
 I knew. 
 I knew what I was getting into, and I still... 
 You just... 
 You get attached. 
 Look after something long enough and it starts to take hold of you. 
 I agreed to this because I never wanted a family. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 I can't believe I'm saying all this to you. 
 It's OK. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Nothing matters any more. 
 Sam. 
 That's enough fresh air for you. 
 Back inside. 
 Yes, sir. 
 What next? 
 Well, a good question. I was asking it myself. 
 Daniel Reed's father is murdered, then not long after he goes absent without leave. 
 His father must have been involved in Alice's abduction, and Daniel knows something. 
 Yeah, but how to find him? 
 Well, he may call his... his girl... girlfriend... 
 Julien? Pull over, I need to... Pull over... 
 Julien? Julien? Julien? 
 Zentrale, das ist Wagen 5. Wir brauchen sofort einen Krankenwagen. 
 Wir sind auf der B43, ungefahr zwei Kilometer hinter der Tankstelle. 
 Julien, can you hear me? 
 Julien! 
 'Hello?' 
 Ja. 
 (Doorbell buzzes) 
 (Knocking) 
 Detective Lenhart. 
 I'm sorry to call so late. I needed to ask you something. 
 OK. 
 Mind if I come in? 
 Well, actually, I was just... 
 It won't take long. 
 Yeah, yeah. Sure. Sure. Come in. 
 I'm sorry to disturb. 
 Excuse the mess. I'm due to retire in a couple of weeks, so thought I'd get a head-start on clearing my stuff out, you know. 
 Hm. 
 This girl, she was reported missing in 2008. 
 Lena Garber. 
 She was troubled, her parents assumed she ran away. 
 I called her mother and she said you were a friend of the family. 
 Yep. Yep. I haven't seen them for years, mind you. 
 Why do you ask? 
 This was taken only four years ago... 
 It appears to be the same girl, no? 
 Yeah, definitely, it could be. 
 And in the front is Alice Webster. 
 Jesus! 
 Alice and Lena... I don't understand - what does that mean? 
 Well, I was hoping, since you knew the family, you might... 
 Daddy? 
 I told you to stay in your room. 
 I didn't know you had a family? 
 My ex-wife lives in London. 
 I don't get to see my little girl very much. 
 Go back to bed, sweetheart. 
 I've done a picture. 
 Can I see it? 
 What is it? 
 That's me and Mummy. 
 In the basement. 
 I think we should continue this... 
 (Girl screams) 
 (He groans) 
 (Whirring) 
 I told you to stay upstairs, darling.
