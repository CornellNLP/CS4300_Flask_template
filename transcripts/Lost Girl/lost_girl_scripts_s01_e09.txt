 Pre-dawn calisthenics. 
 Awesome. 
 (Pants) I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep. 
 You wanna talk about it? 
 No. There's nothing to talk about. 
 Right. 
 So the whole... not-being-able-to-save-Lou Ann-from-death-row, vex-claiming-he-had-info- about-your-mom thing... 
 Never happened. 
 Well, someone thinks it did. 
 Your fae pals are leaving messages on my cell phone. 
 Who is? 
 Trick wants you to come to the bar. (Sniffs) 
 Or... does he not exist either? 
 Come here. 
 What? 
 We'll go for one drink. 
 I really need a break from the fae and their sh1t. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (Celtic music playing) 
 (Indistinct conversations) 
 And... cue the fae and their sh1t. 
 * 
 (whispers) Eek. 
 (Normal voice) You look good. 
 So you are alive. 
 Barely. 
 Look, if you want to talk about what happened... 
 No. No disrespect, but I'd rather not. 
 I'm only here 'cause I wanted to say this face-to-face. 
 Thank you, but right now what I really need is a vacation. 
 Fae-cation. (Chuckles) 
 Well, maybe all this will help. 
 Yeah, seems like a hell of a party. 
 No, it's not a party. 
 It's La Shoshain. 
 (Both) La what now? 
 La Shoshain. 
 It's the most sacred day of the year for fae. 
 I thought you should see it. (Playing glissando) 
 Seems like a party. 
 Well, it is that one time of the year where light and dark fae can get up close and personal with each other, and some of them use it as an excuse to drink and... how can I put this delicately? Uh... fornicate across party lines. 
 So it is a party. I am really likin' this fae day. 
 It's not "fae day." It's... 
 (All) La Shoshain. 
 Good. It's spiritual. 
 Sure thing, t-man. 
 You got any fae day signature cocktails? 
 'Cause we're gonna take two. 
 To go. 
 ♪ 
 (high-pitched shriek) 
 (Crowd murmurs) Ow! 
 What was that? 
 Fae, the celebration is over! 
 The celebration is over! 
 That... (Sighs) was a banshee. 
 A banshee? Wait, don't they have something to do with... 
 Death? Yes, they do. 
 They predict it. 
 Someone in here is going to die... soon. 
 (Bo) Life is hard when you don't know who you are. 
 It's harder when you don't know what you are. 
 My love carries a death sentence. 
 I was lost for years, searching while hiding... only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans. 
 I won't hide anymore. 
 I will live the life I choose. ♪ (Trick) Come on! Let's go! I'll say it again. Everybody not of the five families, clear out! Come on! The rest of you, first round's on the house. So tell me about these five families. Banshees wail only for the noble families... five human and five fae. And if you're not of noble blood, then you're safe? (Chuckles) That's the theory. You're awfully curious for someone who wants to take a break from us all. Got your message. Do you have a way of finding this banshee? Yeah, give me a second. I haven't seen you in a while. Yeah, well, I needed some space. Lots to think about. Booking agent's downtown. The agent's human. Tread lightly. So what, you're gonna find this banshee and make her take back her scream? Banshees don't cause death. They foretell it, and they can't take it back. But you can make a banshee talk,  tell you who the wail is for. I'm gonna show you how. Me? La Shoshain is a holy day. We can't feed, use our gifts, or use violence. Ahh. (Chuckles) But you, being secular, aren't bound by those laws. Ask nicely. You'd be helping out. Say "please." You don't know who your family is. Maybe you have noble blood. Maybe the banshee wailed for you. Close enough. Kenzi. (Mouth full) Mnh! You guys knock yourselves out! This food isn't gonna eat itself! It would be best if only the noble families stayed. Hey, I could have noble blood. No, like if some Duke boned my great-great-grandmother. (Sighs) (Kenzi) I am sure she was a real hot wench. Fine! Don't eat everything. Get the hell out of my way! Is Trick gonna be okay? Gimme a second. I'll meet you in the car. Excuse me, please. What's all this? Lou Ann's. Well, how did you end up with it? (Sighs) I intervened in her execution. She left to go into hiding this morning. Since when do you help the dark? Lou Ann was the midwife at Bo's birth. We owe her. Trick, when are we gonna stop keeping Bo in the dark about who her mother is? As long as we can. You're doing well. No. I'm lying to her. You chose to get emotionally involved. Maybe you should, too. What do we do if Aife shows up? When she shows up...  there will have to be a reckoning. Better go find that banshee. The sooner we find out who she cried for, the sooner they can plan for their death. I'm surprised you're not taking the stairs. I thought you couldn't use electricity on La Shoshain. Wrong culture. The rules are specific. Like what? No powers, no fae-on-fae violence, no feeding on humans. It's all about sacrifice. That sounds pretty heavy. Well, it's to commemorate the sacrifice made by the Blood King. Blood King, blood sacrifice... that's a whole lot of blood and not many details. Well, we're talking about stuff that happened over a thousand years ago. It's more myth than fact. So there are stories then? Yes, there are stories, (Elevator clanks) But all that really remains are the written laws. (Doors creak) Okay, but you must know one story. Bo... read a book. Honey, the cruise ship circuit's nothing to sneeze at. (Door opens) No, four words... "all you can eat." (Door squeaks) Yeah, yeah, you can sleep on it in your crack house you call a home. Stand-up comedians. It's like they want to be miserable or something. (Chuckles) Okay, what can I help you with? Siobhan McManus. Mm-hmm? We need to ask her a few questions about a gig she just played. Oh, Siobhan. Yeah, she's a gorgeous girl. She's a bit of a flake. She called me, uh, from the bus station, canceled all her bookings for the whole week. I'll tell you what, if you find her,  why don't you bring her to me, and I'll wring her little neck, okay? (Woman sneezes) Uh, can I get you a coffee? Gesundheit. We're gonna need to use your office for about 20 minutes. (Celtic music playing, indistinct conversations) What? Death gives me an appetite. (Chuckles) See that guy? Almost 900 years old. If anyone's checking out in the next little while... (Chuckles) it's him. You wanna start a death pool? Oh, so you gamble? If the stakes are right. What do you got? ♪ This sucks! All I wanted was to play the gig, get paid, get wasted, get laid. I hate being made to talk. (Tape rips) Well, if there's any other way we can get it out of you... Well, there isn't, okay? It's all buried in my stupid unconscious. Make sure those are tight, chicky-boo. This gets messy. (Paper rustles) Oh, please, tell me you are not going to... (whirring) (Whirring stops) That'll make her talk? Yeah. My kind has a real bad allergic reaction to iron. (Chuckles) Oh, no. N... n... n... no. Back away with the liver shake. I can't get physical today. You gotta force her to drink this. What do you mean "force"? I have the worst gag reflex. (Thud) Let's get this sh1t over with. I am so sorry. (Sighs) (Gurgling) (Grunting) Is she okay? Just give her a second. (Gurgling, gasping) Is this Siobhan? (Distorted voice) It is the voice of the ancient mourners, the grieving ones. There has been a call to death. (Distorted voice echoing) We are bound to the old families. We cry for their loss. Which family? Kavanagh. Which Kavanagh? The one named Sean. How long does he have? The one named Sean. He will not live past sundown. The one named Sean. (Gurgles) You might want to step back. Why? What happens now? Are you done yet? (Retches loudly) You're not done yet. I got it. Whoa. (Chuckles) Super. Now I won't be able to get out of bed for a week. Can you get me a towel or something? Okay. (Dice clatter) Ohh! That's the lucky pig, right? No, no, no, no, no, no. Those are the wedding gifts, okay? Not even a pig steals from a wedding. (Laughs) Fine. Jeez. (Dice rattle) And xii is king. Are you serious? It's good to be king. Nice rollin', dude. You workin' some dice voodoo? What the hell's your power? Oh, no. I'm just lucky. And I wouldn't use my abilities on La Shoshain anyway. That would be plain wrong. Yeah, yeah, but I just want to know with whom I'm having the pleasure, okay, so do you, like, eat corpses or have a detachable head or what? Really, it's not polite to ask. Come on. The banshee! I may only have a few hours to live! (Chuckles) Since you're dying... (Lowered voice) I'm good with money. How... good? I attract wealth. Mm. You don't say? Yeah. I'm also really good with numbers, so I do the books for some major charities around town. Charities? Mm-hmm. Great. You ever, uh, skim a little off the top? Do I look like that kind of guy? I'm just joshin' you, man. Joking about accounting fraud is like joking about a bomb on a plane. (Whispers) Issues. Kavanagh. Sean Kavanagh. (Thud, glass shatters) (Laughs) Not my time yet! Take that, suckers! (Laughs) (Crowd murmuring) So... who's Kavanagh? How's it hangin', Seany-boy? I just found out I'll be dead by sunset. Pfft. I say you hunker down, get a few pints, and just... (Whispers) wait it out. I know the old stories, okay? If a banshee wails for you, that's it. Your death finds you no matter where you hide. So what are you gonna do about it? Die, I guess. No, man! You are gonna make a list of things you didn't get to do, and you're gonna do them. You think I should make a bucket list? Exactly. Okay, so how 'bout it? Any regrets? I have one. (Clink) So are banshees ever wrong? Not that I know of. Well, if fae aren't allowed to use their powers on La Shoshain, how was the banshee able to scream? Fae aren't allowed to use their powers voluntarily. A banshee's wail complete reflex. Every fae child knows that. You know, I'm trying to figure out if it is the banshee or just my ignorance that has put you in such a foul mood. I'm not in a foul mood. It's just that I've got a lot on my mind. It's early writings of La Shoshain and the Blood King. Shut you up for a little while. What language is this? Mm. Also available in translation. * Okay. Uh, hey. Sean has something he would like to say. Go ahead. Um, yeah. Hi. Hi. I... I've been thinking about, you know, my, uh, my personal situation and what I'd like to do before my personal situation comes into full effect and... and whatnot, a... and, see, there's also this, uh, this family situation... Sean would like to reconcile with his asshole brother before he dies. (Mouths word) So what's the deal? Uh, Liam's dark fae. He turned his back on our light fae family more than eight years go. I haven't seen him since. That's too bad. Yeah, and this is my very last chance to tell him that... that it's all forgiven. And you have exactly 6 hours and 21 minutes to get him here. I... I can pay you, okay, whatever you want. I... I won't need it anymore. Let's just call this one a freebie, okay? Where should I start looking? Liam feeds on human greed. I know exactly where he is. I'll stay. Be my backup? This is my one day off, from cops and fae, to drink in peace. Aw, poor baby. You're driving. (Laughs) (Elevator bell dings) (Indistinct conversations) Excuse me. Liam's been linked with pyramid schemes in the past. Looks like his latest one just toppled. This is nothing but a scam! You're all frauds! (Grunts) Where's my money, you bastards?! It's my life savings. Please give it back to me! (Grunting) Don't play the market if you don't have the cojones. (Elevator bell dings) Chop, chop, people. I want this place gutted in an hour! Liam Kavanagh. Hello, lovely. You like Sushi? I know a chef, trained under Nobu. Holds a table for me every night. Your brother Sean wants to see you. My brother is a self-righteous ass. I want nothing to do with him. Well, he says everything's forgiven. Ha. He's the one who should be begging me for forgiveness. Oh, I see he didn't tell you the delightful story in which he completely screws me over. It doesn't matter. A banshee wailed for him. He'll be dead by sundown. Well, I look forward to reading his obit. (Thud) (Laughs) Triple 20. I feel a perfect game coming on. Yeah, man. Your dart technique is amazing. You should've gone pro. The trick, my young apprentice, is to throw between heartbeats. Once again, please. Dude, ugh! When does the lame-o-go-round stop? I need to get off before I puke. Come on. I love this song. The whole idea when you're dying is to, um, break out of your shell, not throw on an extra coat of wax, okay, so think big. Think... (Whispers) bucket list. Well, Mylene over there... I always kinda fancied her but never had the guts to tell her. (Whispers) "Fancied"? (Normal voice) Oh, my God. All right. Go get her, tiger. Go get her. Come on. I want to see some tongue. (Chuckles) I want to see some Booty action. Go! Go! (Speaks inaudibly) (Snickers) (Speaks inaudibly) * Well, she was very kind about it. (Chuckles) Shot down, huh? Shitty. No. You know, no. It's good. I'm glad I got that off my chest. Thanks, Kenzi. (Chuckles) You're very odd and special, you know that? So what else is on the bucket list? Well, speaking of romance, I've never kissed a human. Don't push your luck, perv. (Laughs) (Footsteps approach) I... I'm sorry. It's not like I was trying to keep anything from you. I just didn't realize Liam still blamed me. If you want to reconcile, Sean, we need the whole story. (Sighs) I was 18. Liam was 16. Right before his gathering. And a gathering is? It's the, uh, the coming -of-age ceremony where a fae chooses light or dark. Hey, you had one of those. Très "Conan the Barbarian." That was the old way. These days it's more like, uh, like a fae bar mitzvah. Oh, wow. Maybe if I had actually chosen a side I could've scored some gifts. Well, everyone in our family has always chosen light, okay, and Liam would've been no different. He was a screwup but basically a good kid. How screwed up are we talkin' here? Pretty bad... partying, stealing, getting into scraps. Oh, yeah. Sounds like a disaster. But, like me, he was always a whiz with numbers. You know, dad had hoped that he'd settle down if he were just given some responsibility, so he had us both helping out with the books at the investment office. And that's when money went missing from the safe. How much? $30,000. Now that was a lot of money back then, and I was the one that was supposed to be setting the example for Liam. He was my responsibility. What did you do? I wanted to teach him a lesson... so I called the police. (Scoffs) Dick move, man. But... but then, instead of facing the music, Liam... he ran away from home as soon as he made bail and he joined the dark fae. The only one of us he ever kept in touch with was mom. She always doted on him. But now she's dead. So Liam's all alone? Look, light or dark, I just want him to know that I still love him... before I'm gone. Maybe you won't kick it. I mean, what the hell is this banshee's batting average? (Creaking) (Panting) Ohh. Whatever it takes, Sean, I'll bring you your brother. Better hurry. It's only a matter of time. Sunset, to be exact. It was a fluke. It was fate. (Sighs) Well, whatever. You've still got some Gonzo living to do, and I'm not letting you do it in a stuffy pub. (Chuckles) Okay. What do you have in mind? (Clicks) (Magneta Lane's "Gambling with God" playing) (Laughs) Oh! I told you you were a natural. I can't believe I'm doing this. You like the car? Very much, but it's breaking the law. What are they gonna do, execute you? Get your skinny ass in there. (Grunts) All right. Twist the red one with the yellow one. ♪ Now touch the black one to them. ♪ (engine starts) (Laughs) Holy sh1t. Oh! O.G. In the house! Okay, don't stall it. Maybe this is how I die... in a fiery, mangled wreck. (Chuckles) Are you sure you don't want to take a pass? It is the fiery, mangly potential that gives it the thrill! Okay? Give 'er! Yes! Giving her. Okay. Come on. Step on the gas, Sean. Go! Whoo! ♪ (siren wailing in distance) Bo, I want to, uh... No, I know. Staking out some creepy investment banker in a crappy parking lot is not your ideal La Shoshain. Nowhere else I'd rather be. (Chuckles) Yeah, right. (Exhales deeply) Bo, I want you to know... I do what I can to protect you. I know. I trust you without a second thought. Mr. Sparkly Conversation, however, you are not. (No affiliation's "nice day" playing) (Music stops) Sweet cheese muffins. What are we doing here? Thought I should see my dad one last time. (Sighs) Noble blood, huh? Nice gig. (Crows cawing) 
 
 Hey, dad. Sean. Did we schedule an appointment? No, sir. I... just wanted to drop by. My son seems to have lost his manners. Patrick Kavanagh. Yo. Kenzi. What brings you two? A banshee. A banshee wailed for me. You sure? Yes, sir. How long? Sundown. That doesn't give you much time to get your estate in order. I'll call Henry to verify your will is up-to-date. No. That's not how I'm gonna spend my last afternoon. You don't want to leave a mess behind you. Well, who cares if I do? All my life, I... I've fallen in line. I've done exactly what's been expected of me just to earn your respect. A Kavanagh prides himself in maintaining control, even in his darkest hours. Well, a friend of mine has shown me that a dead man gets to go a little crazy, and that's what I'm gonna do with the rest of my time. I just wanted to come say good-bye... Tell you I love you. I'll send you the details for the funeral. Sean. Sean! I do care, of course. Sean always did overreact. Liam, too. Got that from his mother. Now if you'll excuse me. Yeah, I'll let you get back to your important work. Betting on the fights, huh? Bobby Bell... he's a long-shot loser. He's old and tired and has no heart whatsoever. Did you know that the Blood King personally wrote all the rules that govern fae society? Yep. And, look, this is really cool. During the first world war, French and German fae soldiers put down their weapons and secretly celebrated La Shoshain together. (Chuckles) Heartwarming, isn't it? (Chuckles) (Cell phone alert chimes) Kenzi's headed home. (Sets down cell phone) Hey. There's our mark. Roger dodger. You coming? I think you're good. Hey. That's a nice car. Either you didn't hear me when I said that I don't want to see my brother, or you're looking to invest, and I don't see a checkbook. Yeah, well, I've got something better than that. (Inhales deeply) (Deep voice, chuckles) Hey. Let's do some blow and get crazy. Yeah, sure, sure. Maybe after you come with me to see your brother. Can you do that for me? I don't want to watch Sean die. Well, maybe the banshee was wrong. Maybe there's nothing to worry about. He'd better die. I sure paid enough for it. (Chuckles) Hey, babe. Just forget Sean, okay? He's already history. You put a hit out on your brother? Why? All I do is destroy lives. I'm a worthless, piece of sh1t monster, all because I chose the dark over the light, because of Sean. That was 80 years ago. And that's how long I've been waiting for mom to die, so that I could kill Sean without breaking her heart. What did you send after your brother? "Drive fancy car." Check. (Laughs) Mm. "Tell off dad." Check. (High-pitched voice) Check. (Normal voice) Overdose on grease. That's actually on my list. Never mind. Mmm. Um, what's next? Well, if there were time, I'd suggest skydiving. "Skydiving." Friend of yours? No. Aah! Run! Aah! (Panting) What is that thing? It's a goblin. They have no respect for any fae or human rules. But they like inflicting pain. We're not gonna die quickly. We're not dying, period. You won't. I'll give myself up. Don't be stupid. (Banging on door) Let's go. The banshee wailed for me. I can't escape death, but I won't drag anyone else into my fate, especially not someone as wonderful as you. You dickhead. I don't believe in fate. You make your own future. You fight for it! You cannot fight a banshee's prediction! We can. (Whoosh) (Gasps) Kenzi! Bo, watch out! There's a... (grunts) (Grunts) (Grunts) (Coughing) Where'd he go? (Grunts) (Panting) (Grunting) (Grunts) (Gunshots) (Clatter) (Coughs) Hey, hey. You okay? Dyson, hey. I thought you weren't allowed to use violence today. Only to protect a life. Complicated set of rules. (Gunshot) Actually, it's pretty intuitive. (Panting) But where did it come from?! Your brother hired it. To kill me? He's been holding a bit of a grudge. But this... this... this is too far! Sean, it's okay. You're safe now. No. No. Where is he now? We left him at his office. Come here. You're gonna be fine. Do you want some water? I'll get you some water, okay? And I'm willing to bet the goblin disposal agency is closed today. We'll do this one by the book. We'll report it to the ash. (Bo) Oh, great. Love that guy. This time, he's you're best friend. He'll call in a cleaner for this, and he'll lodge a protest with the Morrigan, because once the goblins take on a hit, they do not stop until they kill their mark. Well, do you think she'll step in? Liam made an unsanctioned hit against the light on the most sacred of fae holidays. The powers that be are gonna come down on him heavy. "The powers that be" better get to Liam before Sean does. I think he took your crossbow. (Whoosh, thud) (Box thuds) (Door handle rattling) It's La Shoshain. You hurt me, that is a big freakin' no-no. At least I went through an intermediary. Coming after me is one thing, but putting people I care about in danger... Oh, really? You're putting more value on p... people than on rules? Well, it's about time. You don't have it in ya. Let's find out. Agallamh. I invoke Agallamh. What? (Bo) You know, Agallamh... the rule by which any fae can force warring parties to sit down for peace talks. On La Shoshain, it has to be obeyed. I read it in Trick's book. I can get the book. We know what it is. No one has invoked Agallamh in... in forever. Do you want to know why? Probably not. Because the person who calls for the talks forfeits her life if they fail. (Lowered voice) But it's La Shoshain. It's not violence. It's a sacrifice. Really should've skipped to the end, huh? Invoking Agallamh is not all a game! I know. It's the most sacred ceremony on the most sacred day! It's a distillation of everything that the Blood King stood for, all he achieved, and it'll probably end in your death! Well, that is why I need your help to do it right. Of... of course. (Sighs) (Whooshes) The Agallamh is opened. It shall not be closed except by sacrifice. Don't dawdle. Sean's death is called for sundown. If he dies before the Agallamh is closed, it'll be considered a failure, and your life will be forfeit. Who kills me? I think you need to get a volunteer. What? Is there one from the community who will step forward as the claymore? I'll be your claymore. Thanks... I think. (Sighs) Yes, okay, I called the police on Liam after I found out he stole dad's money. I... I was a stupid kid. Should I be killed for that? Retort? For making me look bad in the eyes of our parents and for ruining my life by falsely accusing me, yes, my brother deserves to die! Falsely accusing? But you took the money! (Bo) Hey! Hey! I didn't... hey! Thou shalt not address the... the interlocutor directly. You speak to me, not him. My brother did take the money. I did not! Dad gave the combination to the safe to nobody but us! Okay, I sure as hell didn't take it, and it was in your character. Do you see that? Always judging! God, you are just like dad. Okay. That's enough! That is enough. Get your gun out. I've fulfilled my obligations to the Agallamh. It's finished. (Whoosh) How many of these creeps did you hire? First the claymore kills you, and then the goblin takes care of my brother. There will be no violence in my house. We'll take him outside then. Closure. Put it to the community. I, uh, I put to the... wait. (Whispering) Stall for time, okay? I have a plan. I just need you to give me more time. (Whispers) Okay. (Normal voice) I put to the community... that... we take a short recess. I believe we're allowed one every four hours, so... all in favor? (Chuckles) Great. Then smoke 'em if ya got 'em. (Crowd murmuring) (Sighs) You could save her. (Sighs) (Shifts gears) It's time. Give me a moment. (Sniffles) I said, "it's time." Let's do this. I call the Agallamh back to order. Yeah, yeah. My petition for closure still stands. Do I have a second? Gee, thanks. Okay, then. Uh... (Whoosh) Under the rules of... the ritual of... the sacred Agallamh... on, uh, on this sacred... La Shoshain, I... well, with due reverence to the Blood King. I mean, there was a fine king. (Chuckles) Am I right? Closure! Okay. I put the motion of closure to the community. No. No way. Negatory. We're here. (Sighs) (Patrick) I submit myself to the sacred summons of the Agallamh, though, for the life of me, I don't see what good this will do. Well, let's swear you into the inner circle and find out. (Whispers indistinctly) All right. Ask your questions. I only have one. Why did you steal $30,000 from your own safe? (Scoffs) That's ridiculous. I remind the witness that speaking a falsehood is punishable by death, so I'll ask you again, why did you steal $30,000 from your own safe? (Crowd murmuring) I have my vices. I keep them under control. What did you do? It was gambling debts, wasn't it? That's your thing, right... use investor money to cover your losses, move cash around so no one notices? Liam here is a real chip off the old block, pops. You boys had no reason to be at the safe that weekend. You... you should never have known. I was being thorough, dad, just like you taught me. You let me take the fall. You let them lock me up. I bailed you out the very next day. I d... I... I didn't expect you to be a baby and go running off and joining the dark. All this time? I... (Voice breaks) I... I couldn't tell anyone! Your... your mother would've left me. I... think... think of what it would've done to the family name! You put your own reputation ahead of the happiness of your sons. It's an illness. Gambling's a disease. I would like to recognize the error I made in assuming my brother's guilt. This is the family pendant. It is the symbol of the birthright. One day when he passes, you will have control over the family holdings. You deserve it. With my sacrifice, I move for peace. A sacrifice has been offered. Do you offer one in return? I'll pay back as much as I can to the people I've ripped off... if dad moves mom's grave to neutral ground so I can visit it. I will. Then I also call off the hit. (Sighs) Then we have a peace. I move for closure. I second the motion. (Chuckles) Thanks for not giving up on me. (Chuckles) (Kenzi) Sundown, Bo. You saved him, and you beat the banshee. We beat the banshee. It was a 50/50 effort. Well, if we're being honest, I'd peg it more at 30/70, 'cause, let's face it, all you did was read from a book, so... Oh! Well, who was the one who put her life on the line? Who was the one that didn't know  she was putting her life on the line, hmm? (Singsongy) Mm, mm, mm. What about dad? I don't know. Treatment, I guess, if he can be talked into it. Good peace.
