 Come on, man! 
 It's a free throw! 
 That means it's free! 
 No one's guarding you! 
 How do you miss that?

 Hey, careful, those tears may freeze to your face out there. 
 You don't even like basketball, Benny. 
 Nope, but I do like watching your team lose.

 Aah!

 Excuse me, could I get the check please? 
 I'll take care of that. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Excuse me, could you add a blueberry scone to go, please? 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 Everything okay? 
 I tried calling you. 
 Everything went to voicemail. 
 Something came up, a last-minute thing. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 You know that I would never miss a breakfast with you - unless it was important. 
 - Right. 
 A work thing? 
 No. 
 More, like, personal. 
 It's probably better if I show you.

 Only time I could get in to see it was this morning. 
 Two bedrooms, walk in closets,     jetliner views. 
 Best part: Smack dab in the middle of Tribeca. 
 - Seven-minute walk to work. 
 - This is gorgeous. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 This has to be so expensive. 
 But why are you even moving? 
 Because I want you to move in with me, so that means I need a bigger place. 
 [WARM MUSIC] 
 ♪     Wow. 
 I know, I know. 
 I know it seems fast, okay? 
 But I've been thinking about things, and Maggie, you're really important to me. 
 And you're important to me, but... 
 I thought that we should just do it, you know? 
 See what happens. 
 - I mean, I like the idea. 
 - Uh-huh. 
 But we've only been together for a few months. 
 - Six. 
 - Fine, six. 
 I think we'd have a lot of fun in there. 
 Look at this big, beautiful bathtub in the master. 
 Look at that. 
 Yeah, like I said, it's gorgeous. 
 [CELL PHONE BUZZES] 
 Double homicide. 
 Two Customs Agents. 
 Um... 
 Can we talk about this later? 
 I need to think about it. 
 Bye. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 We got two dead and one with a serious headwound. 
 Possible concussion, but I told them that we need to talk to him before they roll him to the hospital. 
 Okay, I'll go see what I can find out about the witness. 
 [SIGHS] 
 All right, can you coordinate with ERT and then make sure we get a rush on ballistics? 
 Copy that. 
 Any idea what they were after? 
 Took a look at the security footage. 
 Shows them making off with one of those metal tankers over there. 
 Video quality's not too good, so I can't tell which one yet. 
 I'll get it forwarded to the JOC. 
 They're ready to roll the witness to the hospital. 
 I mean, job's always been low-key. 
 I just got Benny hired four months ago. 
 We were friends from high school. 
 It was supposed to be cushy. 
 I told him the only sure thing's a government job, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm really sorry about your friend. 
 Can you tell us anything about his killer? 
 It was two guys, black ski masks, gloves, but I could see their wrists. 
 I'm pretty sure they were white. 
 Maybe   s,   s, if I had to guess from their voices. 
 Did you notice any scars or tattoos on those wrists? 
 No. 
 Once that gun was on my face, I froze up. 
 Hard to think straight when that happens, but one of them had a gold watch on. 
 I do remember that. 
 I'm not sure what kind though. 
 They took a tanker. 
 Do you have any idea why? 
 Not really. 
 It was anhydrous ammonia, for farming, right? 
 Yeah, bomb makers and meth dealers like it too. 
 Hey, sorry, I'm gonna have to cut this short. 
 He's got a possible brain bleed, so if you guys need to talk more, it's gonna have to be at the hospital. 
 Thank you. 
 Take care. 
 Check it out. 
 What you got? 
 Blood. 
 And since our dead agents are over there... 
 One of our suspects is wounded. 
 Hey, morning, guys. 
 So listen up. 
 Benjamin Crawford, Michael Sanders, two federal officers, were both murdered last night. 
 Lucky for us, they managed to tag one of our suspects with a bullet, so let's check all hospitals for white males in their   s with gunshot wounds. 
 And somebody work the phones. 
 Call local drugstores, check for any suspicious first-aid purchases near the warehouse, yeah? 
 Good. 
 Hey, where are we with surveillance video? 
 Putting it up now. 
 Can't get a visual on the suspect, but I got a make and model of the getaway truck. 
 It's green      Ford F   , diesel. 
 Okay, let me guess, stolen? 
 Probably. 
 The plate belongs to a blue Toyota Camry. 
 All right, let's put a BOLO out on the F   . 
 Not every day you see truck pulling a  ,    gallon tanker around New York. 
 Hey, Elise, what do we know about the suspect's DNA? 
 No hits in CODIS, but ballistics recovered from the scene is a match from an unsolved gang murder in Brooklyn two months back. 
 No arrests were made, but notes suggest involvement by a gang called the  - -  Knights, a white meth gang based in Queens. 
 It makes sense. 
 There's been a rise in ammonia thefts the last nine months or so. 
 COVID has broken down the usual chemical supply chain. 
 Right, so the Knights were desperate for ammonia, couldn't find any to buy, so they stole it instead. 
 Let's get the gang unit involved. 
 Yeah. 
 Knights are fairly new, but their roots aren't. 
 Small white gang, they got their start in prison, made their money on the streets cooking and selling meth. 
 Meth prices have skyrocketed lately due to the shortage of chemicals. 
 Explains the timing of the heist. 
 Exactly. 
 The Knights are smart. 
 They think more like businessmen than tweakers. 
 Unless you try to prevent them from stealing, I don't know, a bunch of ammonia, and then they'll pump you full of bullets. 
 Here's our current list of known member and associates. 
 Their gang leader was murdered a month ago, so that left a power vacuum. 
 Do we know who took his place? 
 - [PHONE CHIMES] 
 - No, gang's pretty tight-knit. 
 NYPD just found the getaway truck abandoned in Long Island City. 
 They're holding it for us now. 
 All right, send Tiffany and Scola. 
 Yep. 
 Not a lot of trucks in this area. 
 Lady walking her dog noticed the busted windshield, peaked inside, saw all the blood, gave us a call. 
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
 This guy's not getting far losing this much blood. 
 He's gonna need medical attention ASAP. 
 Hey, Tiff, we got a drip pattern over here. 
 Based on the distance between the droplets, it looks like he moved pretty quickly through here heading east based on the direction of the trail. 
 All right, no hospitals, urgent cares, or clinics in the area. 
 Not a great place to be bleeding to death. 
 So the question is, why jump out here? 
 When I was still NYPD, I arrested this undertaker. 
 The guy's side gig was patching up gangbangers for cash. 
 Mmm, sounds like quite the undertaking. 
 There are no morticians around here, but there's a vet clinic up the block. 
 [BUZZER] 
 There's a light on in the back. 
 Sorry, we're closed. 
 FBI. 
 We're looking for a suspect in the area. 
 - White male,   s,   s? 
 - Gunshot wound? 
 I'm sorry, I haven't seen anyone. 
 I mean, why would someone like that come here? 
 You mind if we check your cameras to see if he came through here? 
 I, uh, don't know how to. 
 I'd have to call the building owner... 
 We're coming in. 
 Step back, on the ground. 
 [DOGS BARKING] 
 All clear back there. 
 All right, ma'am, up in the chair. 
 Start talking, and you better make it count, because if you lie to us again, you're going to jail for harboring a murderer. 
 Murderer? 
 He never said he did something like that, I swear. 
 Who never said? 
 You know his name? 
 Damon. 
 He's my cousin. 
 He called a couple hours ago, forced me to help him. 
 I just sewed up his shoulder and dropped him off at the subway. 
 I don't even know where he stay right now. 
 All right, anyone with Damon when he arrived? 
 Another white guy around the same age? 
 No. 
 But you can check the cameras. 
 I swear I've told you everything I know. 
 We're gonna need Damon's full name and the cell number that he called you from. 
 [CRYING] 
 We've just identified our wounded suspect. 
 Damon Marshall appears to be a foot soldier for the Knights. 
 He was convicted of aggravated assault in New Hampshire, one of the only states to not require a DNA sample for misdemeanors or waylaying your coworker with a pipe wrench, apparently. 
 Work history shows Damon used to drive a truck for CPE Logistics. 
 Picked up shipments from the Queens CFS warehouse at least a dozen times, according to the company driver logs. 
 Which how he and his friend likely knew about the ammonia tankers. 
 One mystery solved, two shooters still at large. 
 Any updates on our mysterious second shooter? 
 We checked the cameras around the vet. 
 Damon arrived solo. 
 Which means the other shooter must've been dropped off with the tanker before Damon went to get help. 
 Looks like the cell phone that Damon used to call the vet was shut off two hours ago, but before that, pinged off a tower in East Flatbush. 
 Okay, East Flatbush. 
 Does Damon have a registered address there? 
 Relatives, friends? 
 Probation records show he has an aunt at East   nd Street, apartment  C. 
 - Boom. 
 - We're on it. 
 Mind a third wheel on this one? 
 Yeah, sure, we could use the extra body, but you're driving. 
 Mrs. 
 Clay, FBI! 
 We need to speak with you! 
 About what? 
 We're looking for your nephew, Damon. 
 Damon? 
 Is everything okay? 
 Anyone else in the apartment with you? 
 No, no, I live alone. 
 Mrs. 
 Clay, if we could just come in and have a chat, that would really help us out. 
 He's running! 
 - Aah! 
 What are you doing? 
 - Up against the wall! 
 - Don't move. 
 - You can't come in here!

 Oh, we're gonna need more than a pin to get anything off of this. 
 His phone's pretty banged up. 
 Hopefully the JOC can still pull something. 
 Yeah, units still got the aunt upstairs, so I'll see if she knows what this number is. 
 I'll meet you there. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Okay? 
 Do you know how close you just came? 
 Hey, I'm fine. 
 We had this dude in the pocket the whole time. 
 Hell of a shot though. 
 Really was. 
 You didn't have to shoot him! 
 He would've surrendered if you just asked. 
 He didn't give us a chance. 
 Ma'am, your nephew killed two federal officers. 
 So you were harboring a federal fugitive, and that is a felony. 
 I-I had no idea. 
 Okay, did he mention anything about a robbery or a shooting? 
 No. 
 Every time I asked him what happened, he would just shut me down. 
 He had the numbers "    " written on his hand. 
 That mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 All right, Damon Marshall, our first suspect, is no longer with us. 
 So our focus is now on shooter number two. 
 What we know so far is he's a white male in his   s, affiliated with the Knights, and he has an expensive gold watch. 
 Ian, anything from Damon's phone? 
 No, nothing. 
 It was scrubbed. 
 Right. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Kelly, tell me something good. 
 Aw, sorry, boss, I'm striking out more than uh...

 - Who? 
 Career strikeout leader, but he's also in the Hall of Fame, which means... 
 - He was really good?

 What about you? 
 I do not need a home run here. 
 Broken-bat, opposite-field single would suffice. 
 Yeah, I have no idea what you're talking about, sorry. 
 But I do know that ERT didn't recover any usable prints. 
 The perps must've been gloved up while they were inside the truck. 
 Right. 
 Okay, let's take another look at the data. 
 Surveillance video, cell phone records... 
 I just had a meet with a known associate of the Knights. 
 A low level street dealer named Lyle Porter. 
 I figure that's our best way of gathering intel. 
 Okay, I know where you're going with this, but it takes a long time to flip up to a shot caller. 
 That's why I'm coming out hot. 
 I'm gonna ask for enough weight that I know this guy, Lyle, can't handle. 
 It means he's gotta loop in one of the senior members of the gang. 
 I make one buy, bust him for meth distribution, then leverage our boy for some information on these homicides. 
 It's worth a shot. 
 All right, if it brings us to the murderers and keeps the meth off the streets. 
 But I want Maggie and OA in on that operation.

 The problem is, he's not the only white guy who wears a gold watch, so we need evidence. 
 Ian, where are we with Clint's burner? 
 Uh, pulling what I have now. 
 At the time of the robbery, it looks like Clint's burner pinged off a cell tower within a mile of the CFS warehouse. 
 Can we narrow it down any more than that? 
 No, his GPS was turned off manually, so I can't pin him directly to the warehouse, but like I said, we know he was close by. 
 What about after the robbery? 
 Cell towers put him on the eastern side of Stanton Island. 
 He was stationary at that location for over an hour that morning. 
 Huh. 
 He spent a lot of time there over the last three days as well. 
 We know that they had to unload the tanker somewhere between the CFS Warehouse and the location of the abandoned pickup truck, which was discovered two hours later, right? 
 Right, what are you getting at? 
 So maybe this area, the eastern part of Stanton Island, maybe that's where Clint cooks his meth. 
 Right, so they dropped the tanker off there at his lab. 
 That makes sense. 
 That part of the island's all abandoned warehouses and industrial parks. 
 It's a great place to hide a meth lab. 
 Have Tiffany and Scola coordinate with air units. 
 Grid search the entire radius. 
 If we connect Clint to that tanker, we can connect him to the two murders. 
 Well, this is the end of the grid for this road.

 You know, it'd almost be impressive if you didn't copy the whole thing. 
 Yeah? 
 Don't know what you're talking about. 
 Listen, man, you help us out, we'll take the death penalty off the table. 
 We'll tell prosecutors that you're willing to cooperate. 
 I'd rather die than cooperate with you.

 ♪      We found $   ,    in cash      in a gym bag in Clint's apartment. 
 Big bills, so it's likely not drug money. 
 No, that sounds like bomb money. 
 Yeah. 
 ERT's processing it for prints. 
 Okay, good. 
 [SIGHS] 
 So the JOC is digging through Clint's recent contacts. 
 NSA and Homeland Security are working the domestic terror angle. 
 And according to our bomb techs, we're looking at about  ,   pounds of explosive material. 
 We're talking Oklahoma City. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Excuse me, but I just... 
 I was digging back through Clint's prison records, and they show when he was in Greenville, he was aligned with an anti-government group called The Army of Rebels. 
 Yeah, I know them. 
 They're a hardcore prison gang. 
 All white. 
 He probably joined for protection. 
 Yeah. 
 Wait. 
 That's the guy that Clint met at the club. 
 Hey, fingerprints from the money at Clint's residence, are matched to Robby Wilkerson. 
 He's a   -year-old Army vet, discharged as an E after a training exercise injury. 
 Most recently he served four years in Greenville, and he shared a cell with our friend, Clint Helms. 
 - And we have located him yet? 
 - Uh, we got units checking in on his last known address. 
 We're into friends and family, seeing if anyone's seen him in the past    hours. 
 Where are we with his phone and his social media? 
 Phone is a dead end. 
 It's been off all day. 
 I was able to look into Wilkerson's social media usernames and cross-reference them on unregulated message boards. 
 I found dozens of posts with the same online handle. 
 Most of them from the past year are... 
 surprise, surprise... 
 Anti-government screeds. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 "Government is trampling on the rights "of God-fearing American people, restricting personal freedoms and liberties." He also has a serious man-crush on Timothy McVeigh. 
 Any indicators or specific targets mentioned? 
 Possibly. 
 There's lots of recent tirades about the removal of Confederate monuments. 
 "When all of the federal buildings in New York "are named after radical left-wing politicians - and judges." - I think I have a location. 
 I checked the CCTV cameras outside the Ivory Club. 
 - Pull it up. 
 - Camera shows Clint and Wilkerson driving away in gray Ford van. 
 Perfect fit for the size bomb we're talking about. 
 Plates came back to a rental company called Venture Rentals. 
 They didn't even know it was gone. 
 They said someone must've stolen it. 
 Tell me they have anti-theft tracking on all their vehicles. 
 They're tracking it now. 
 Yes, I'm still here. 
 North on Broadway, crossing Chambers. 
 Alert all units in the area to the suspect's vehicle. 
 - Yeah. 
 - The van just turned east on Worth, - but the signal just died. 
 - Wait it died how? 
 The Ted Weiss Federal Building is on the corner of Worth. 
 The underground garage would block the signal. 
 Go now. 
 [BRAKES SCREECHING] 
 First up, we need to evacuate the building. 
 Let's split up. 
 Take it floor by floor. 
 - That gray van's here somewhere. 
 - All right. 
 All right, let's move. 
 Main lobby! 
 We gotta get everyone out now. 
 Please step this way, sir. 
 - Keep moving. 
 - All the way down... 
 Hey, FBI! 
 Don't move! 
 Suspect's on the run, back of the building towards the intersection. 
 [GRUNTING] 
 [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING] 
 Where's the bomb, huh? 
 Where is it!? 
 You'll find out soon enough. 
 Where is it!? 
 We got him. 
 All right, the response truck is en route, but bomb squad's still four minutes out. 
 Okay. 
 Everybody clear this block now. 
 - Wait, where are you going? 
 - To find the bomb. 
 Maggie, we don't have a choice. 
 Okay, go, go. 
 This is Special Agent Maggie Bell. 
 I need to speak with Carla Flores from the Bomb Squad immediately. 
 Well, find her, we have a live bomb. 
 I located the suspect's vehicle. 
 It is in B , west-facing towards the front of the building. 
 [HEAVY BREATHING] 
 Okay. 
 Looks like we have seven barrels of ANFO... 
 Closed circuit loop... 
 Feeding into... 
 A... 
 Central timer power unit. 
 Okay, Flores is saying that you need to find a way to separate and open up the circuit. 
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
 ♪      [EXHALES] 
 Okay. 
 The bad news: The blasting caps have redundancies, so if I pull a wire, it could trigger a switch and detonate. 
 And some more bad news. 
 This is bomb is on a timer. 
 minutes and seconds. 
 I repeat, minutes and    seconds. 
 Is there a safe arm switch? 
 Maggie, okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Oh, Maggie. 
 Carla, where would the switch be? 
 It's typically hidden somewhere      in the front of the vehicle. 
 It can be as small as a mike switch. 
 Okay. 
 How's it going over there, Maggie? 
 Uh, we've got a minute, on the timer. 
 OA's looking for the safety now. 
 That's barely enough time to clear the blast radius. 
 This is bomb is sophisticated and powerful. 
 You need to get the hell out of there now. 
 All right, everybody back now! 
 You heard him. 
 Everybody fall back! 
 Come with me, man. 
 Come on! 
 Okay, there's no way that they evacuated - this entire building. 
 - Yeah, I know, I know. 
 Come on! 
 You built it, now defuse it. 
 Maggie, you gotta get outta here. 
 - I'm not leaving. 
 No. 
 - Maggie, please. 
 There's    seconds left on the timer. 
 I can't find the switch. 
 Up to you, Wilkerson. 
 Where's the switch, man!? 
 Go to hell! 
 It's okay, it's okay. 
 Just keep looking. 
 -    seconds. 
 - [HEAVY BREATHING] 
 Aw,    seconds, and we go together. 
 [WHIMPERING] 
 There's    seconds left. 
 Where is it!? 
 [HEAVY BREATHING] 
 It's behind the radio. 
 - Hold this. 
 - I got it. 
 - Careful, careful, careful. 
 - Okay... 
 - You see that? 
 - Yeah. 
 [INTENSE MUSIC] 
 Go slow, go slow. 
 There you go.

 We're good. 
 Okay. 
 Okay... 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So remind me to never invite your boyfriend to poker night. 
 Naw, I'm not that brave or ballsy, trust me. 
 I just knew our guy didn't have the guts to do it. 
 When I told him we were going to the garage, I felt him resist a little, digging his heels in. 
 If he actually wanted to be a martyr, he would've been thrilled. 
 I knew he was fronting. 
 That's impressive. 
 Yeah, it is, but uh, I gotta go, guys. 
 I got dinner with Mona. 
 I don't wanna be late. 
 All right, see you later. 
 Dinner... that actually doesn't sound like a bad idea. 
 - I know a perfect place. 
 - Yeah, great. 
 Come on. 
 [SIGHS] 
 This place better be great. 
 - I am starving. 
 - It is, I promise. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
 What's up? 
 This is the apartment. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 It's ours. 
 Signed the lease. 
 I put the deposit down and everything. 
 What? 
 You signed the lease? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I said that I needed to think about that. 
 Oh, come on, Maggie, don't overthink this. 
 You keep saying that to me, that I overthink, but you tell me that I have room to say how this goes down in our relationship. 
 That I have all the time that I need. 
 That's not what's happening here. 
 Look, I didn't mean it like that. 
 What I'm saying is I think this is the right... 
 Nestor, Nestor, listen to me. 
 I'm not moving in with you. 
 Okay, okay, I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to push things. 
 But you did. 
 Here's the thing... 
 That's what makes you really great at your job. 
 It's not gonna work for me.
