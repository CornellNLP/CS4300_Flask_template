 ♪  -The FBI defines serial murder as the unlawful killing  of two or more victims at separate events  by the same offender or offenders. 
 Welcome to Tuesday morning. 
 Our first victim is Beatriz Santos. 
 Married, 28. 
 Reported missing by her husband eight days ago. 
 M.E. 
 says she was killed shortly after being abducted. 
 Most likely she was sexually assaulted as well. 
 - I bet I know the answer but any DNA? 
 - Not after being underwater a week. 
 - Our second victim: Mona Kitberg. 
 Also late 20s, married. 
 Disappeared five weeks ago. 
 And our third is DeAnne Carlisle--  uh, married, 20s. 
 Disappeared eleven weeks ago. 
 M.E. 
 says all three were strangled  but cannot confirm sexual assault  on Kitberg and Carlisle. 
 Too much time in the water. 
 - No, but we should assume that it happened. 
 - So ERT is on the scene, doing that thing they do. 
 Meanwhile, we need footage--  surveillance cams, security video, traffic cams  for a five-mile radius around the crime scene, yeah? 
 - I mean, it's pretty country up there. 
 Not much cameras. 
 - Which is why we also need dumps  from cell phone towers in the area. 
 - That'll take subpoenas. 
 We'll get started on 'em. 
 - All right, second. 
 What connects the victims? 
 They're all from the same area,  so we know that's his hunting ground. 
 But why did he choose these women? 
 We figure that out, we'll find him. 
 So we need full backgrounds on the women--  friends, family, husbands, criminal records. 
 - DeAnne Carlisle was murdered three months ago. 
 Mona Kitberg, a month back. 
 And Beatriz Santos, last week. 
 This guy is on the hunt. 
 Do not waste any time. 
 [tense synth music] 
 - Let's go to work. 
 - So I've been looking at it... 
 - Jubal. 
 - Yeah? 
 - All three victims were married, right? 
 - Yeah. 
 Why? 
 - When they were found, they didn't have wedding rings on. 
 ♪  - None of them? 
 - Nope. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 - So he takes the ring as a trophy. 
 What does that mean? 
 - Ring means romance, right? 
 - Mm, possession in a way. 
 Maybe he wants to feel like  he's stealing them from their husbands. 
 - Okay, so if he's sexually obsessed,  then maybe he observed them first. 
 Jubal, we'll go talk to Santos's husband,  see if knows anyone with eyes on her. 
 - Jubal. 
 - Uh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 That sounds good. 
 I'll tell Scola and Tiffany  to talk to the husbands of the other victims.

 Uh... 
 You remember Cory McMay? 
 Raped and killed that woman upstate? 
 - Ah. 
 Yeah, Jubal. 
 I remember Cory McMay. 
 What about him? 
 - We caught a serial murder case. 
 Three women, raped and killed. 
 Bound with wire. 
 The same kind McMay used, 14-gauge electrical. 
 - Wow. 
 And? 
 - All three of 'em were missing a wedding ring. 
 Which McMay's victim was missing hers. 
 At the time, we thought that was irrelevant but now--  - Yeah, and now you're thinking it isn't. 
 Why? 
 - Also the bodies were found in north Westchester. 
 Which is where McMay lived. 
 And--and the bodies were tied with a square knot,  which McMay used. 
 - Right. 
 I use a square knot, Jubal. 
 Did I kill them? 
 - Uh... 
 uh... 
 - McMay's case was eight years ago. 
 He's serving 30 to life. 
 I mean, whoever killed your victims, it wasn't McMay. 
 - Yeah, yeah. 
 No, no, of course. 
 But, uh, maybe  he influenced somebody, a copycat type of... 
 - Yeah. 
 - Or... 
 You know, maybe we made a mistake.

 - I'm sorry. 
 You think McMay was innocent? 
 You think we put away the wrong guy? 
 - It's not impossible. 
 - Yeah. 
 It is. 
 It--McMay was a meth head with a history of violence. 
 He lied on the stand. 
 And by the way, his DNA was on the murder victim. 
 - Yeah. 
 And he had an alibi witness. 
 - Yeah, who nobody believed, including you. 
 - Well, I mean, can't really trust my--  think we both know there was a lot going on at the time.

 You found Bea in a lake? 
 How did she get there? 
 - That's what we're trying to find out. 
 Mr. 
 Santos, can you tell us what happened  the night she disappeared? 
 - Well, you found two other women, right? 
 Who are they? 
 - I'm sorry. 
 We can't talk about the other victims. 
 - Do you at least have a suspect? 
 - We can't get into that either. 
 - Ever since Bea's gone missing,  all you cops can say is "We can't say anything."  Now she's dead and you're giving me the same crap? 
 I want to know what happened to my wife! 
 - Sir, we understand that. 
 Okay? 
 And we want to help. 
 But the best way for us to do that  is for you to answer our questions.

 Where was your wife the night she disappeared? 
 ♪  -Bea tends bar at a local restaurant. 
 You know, farm-to-table and all that. 
 All right. 
 They close at midnight. 
 She's usually back by 1:00. 
 And she texted me that night. 
 She said she'd be home in 20 minutes. 
 That's the last I heard from her. 
 - Okay. 
 Okay, did she mention anybody stalking or harassing her? 
 - No, just drunks hitting on her at the bar. 
 - Did she mention anyone by name? 
 I mean, somebody that worried her  or was maybe a little too attentive? 
 - No. 
 She laughed about it. 
 And she said she could handle herself. 
 - What's the restaurant? 
 - Lilly's in North Salem. 
 ♪  - Thank you. 
 - So as maître d',  you're keep an eye on the room all night, yeah? 
 - That's the job. 
 - Okay, well, do you remember  anybody hanging around Beatrice Santos,  maybe bothering her around the time she disappeared? 
 - I don't remember anyone bothering her period. 
 We serve high-end clientele here. 
 It's not the corner bar. 
 - Hm, her husband said  that she got hit on by customers all the time. 
 - I guess she told her husband more than she told me. 
 Not that I'm surprised she said it. 
 - Wait. 
 Why not? 
 - Bea could be sensitive. 
 Not every compliment means you're getting hit on. 
 - Right. 
 It's just interesting. 
 Her husband didn't describe her like that. 
 - He didn't work with her. 
 - That's a cool tattoo. 
 No, the one on your hand. 
 - Oh. 
 Thanks, bro. 
 - Yeah. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 - Uh, tattoo parlor in Kingston. 
 Guy said it was a Buddhist symbol.

 That's cool.

 I gotta talk to the kitchen. 
 both: Yeah, sure.

 [buzzer rings] 
 - Okay, Mr. 
 Tate. 
 We talked to your parole officer. 
 And it turns out one of the conditions of your parole  is that he has to approve everything  that you post to social media.

 - You obviously didn't show him some of the posts  that we found on your laptop. 
 Especially the one where you photoshop Beatriz Santos's head  onto some images of women having s*x with animals. 
 That's a parole violation.

 Jokes. 
 They're for a laugh.

 A little rough on Bea Santos, don't you think?

 All right? 
 Maybe I tried to be nice, offer to buy her a drink,  and she treated me like dirt on her shoe?

 Tate's alibi checks out. 
 He's a creep but he's not our guy.

 Short for "involuntary celibate."  - You know, losers who blame their lack of dating success  on women being bitches. 
 - Yeah. 
 I know what an incel is. 
 Any connection to the killings? 
 - Maybe. 
 Tate wasn't the only one to post memes. 
 There are hundreds of images of women on the site,  including the murdered women. 
 - All three were on the site. 
 - Yeah, there's a lot of information on here--  where they work, where they live. 
 I mean, they would have been able to track them down  with what's on here.

 Other than Tate, who's posting images? 
 Who else is on the site?

 Don't worry. 
 I'll get their real names. 
 We need this guy in custody.

 Guy named Cory McMay. 
 Raped and killed a woman eight years ago  in northern Westchester.

 Methods, materials used. 
 McMay's victim was taken at night,  same as the current ones. 
 - Okay, um... 
 I don't understand. 
 He's in prison. 
 What do you want us to be looking for? 
 - Anything that would explain the overlap. 
 Maybe there's a copycat out there. 
 Or who knows? 
 Maybe we got it wrong about McMay. 
 Maybe he didn't do the murder eight years ago. 
 - You think McMay's innocent? 
 - No. 
 I'm just saying. 
 We have three unsolved murders with a similar pattern,  so it's worth checking out. 
 A place to start is with McMay's sister. 
 She gave him an alibi for the time of the murder. 
 Nobody believed her. 
 But like I said, it's worth checking out.

 This is your case.

 He was just offering to help. 
 - No, he was looking for another press case,  pad his resumé. 
 - At least he offered. 
 - I don't understand. 
 Why are you asking about Cory now? 
 - Well, his case may have something to do  with a current case that we're investigating. 
 - Meaning that there's a chance  someone's imitating what he did eight years ago. 
 - We found three dead women,  and the way that they were killed is very similar  to the way that Cory's victims were killed.

 They haven't mentioned it.

 We can talk to your neighbors.

 - So what do you do for the children's hospital? 
 - I'm a volunteer actually. 
 I was pretty sick as a kid,  spent a lot of time here. 
 I'm on disability--I--I--  I hurt my back working construction  so I've got the time. 
 Really though. 
 Why is the FBI so interested in my car? 
 - Well, like I said, turned up in another investigation. 
 - Well, thank you for your time. 
 - Take care. 
 - Have a good day. 
 - Hey, Jubal. 
 - Yeah? 
 - We talked to DeLeon's neighbors. 
 They say that he's a good guy. 
 - But no surveillance cams either. 
 - Okay, so everything he says checks out. 
 - Yeah, right down to his childhood illness. 
 Poor guy had leukemia. 
 - We sent his plates to the state patrol. 
 And the sheriff, they're running database checks  but no hits yet. 
 - Only good news, if you can call it that,  is that we found the name for the fourth victim  on the incel website. 
 
 
 
 So whoever's doing the murders  is a big fan of that godforsaken site. 
 - Where are we with finding names for these clowns?

 Good news, people. 
 Just got off the phone with the incel CEO. 
 Took some arm twisting but he ran a series of screens. 
 People who looked at the memes,  people who lived in the general vicinity of the crime scenes. 
 We got one hit. 
 Kenneth Higby. 
 [dramatic music] 
 - 28. 
 Runs a coffee shop upstate, lives above it. 
 No criminal record. 
 And he's married. 
 ♪  - What kind of incel is married? 
 - Any word from the medical examiner about DNA? 
 - Still waiting. 
 - Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 - According to the county building department,  Higby filed a permit to re-wire his coffee shop  six months ago. 
 - The timing is right. 
 Six months is right before the first murder. 
 - Job likes that takes a ton of 14-gauge electrical wire. 
 - Have Maggie and OA bring him in. 
 - Yep. 
 - So why did you have  your coffee shop re-wired, Mr. 
 Higby? 
 - Why did I, um--  because I was shut down for, like, forever. 
 And I'm trying to get my customers back. 
 It's all about good Wi-Fi. 
 People don't really care about the coffee. 
 - [laughs] 
 Fair enough. 
 We also talked to your contractors. 
 They said that you asked to keep any leftover wire  when they were finished. 
 - Sure. 
 I paid for it. 
 I use it to fix stuff. 
 Why are you asking about this? 
 - You ever hear of the website Incel Uprising? 
 - No. 
 - No? 
 You've never visited it? 
 - No. 
 - No, you never read any of the memes? 
 Hung out in the chatrooms?

 You can look through it all you want. 
 I never went to whatever this place is you're talking about.

 ♪  - I think he's telling the truth. 
 There's nothing on Higby's laptop  that says he's been to the incel site. 
 - Well, then why did Incel Uprising give us his name? 
 - Because they screwed up. 
 They used the IP address from his coffee shop's router. 
 Assumed it was his laptop. 
 - So it wasn't Higby. 
 Well, the good news is that  it's probably a customer, right? 
 - Uh, you're right. 
 But it's not that simple. 
 We checked the router. 
 Identified a computer that was in use  every time the incel website was visited from the shop. 
 But that laptop is on a VPN. 
 So there's no way we can identify the user. 
 - Isn't there a bank across the street from the coffee shop? 
 Maybe we can get access to their video cameras? 
 ♪  - On it. 
 - Got a result from the M.E. 
 on the plastic they found at last night's crime scene. 
 There was DNA. 
 They ran it and got a match. 
 - Who is it? 
 - His name is Cory McMay. 
 [dramatic music] 
 But it's gotta be wrong. 
 I ran him. 
 Can't be the guy. 
 - That's literally impossible. 
 McMay's been in prison for the last eight years. 
 - Cory McMay, incarcerated for the past 94 months. 
 One of the few people we can say without absolute certainty  did not murder anyone recently. 
 And yet for some reason, his DNA is on the plastic. 
 - What about family? 
 Siblings? 
 - Just a sister, so not a suspect. 
 - So what does this mean? 
 - I don't know. 
 - We pulled the images from the ATM across the street  from Higby's coffee shop. 
 These were taken ten minutes  before someone logged onto the incel website  from the coffee shop  the day before Beatriz Santos was killed. 
 - Well, that is Peter DeLeon from the hospital. 
 - The guy whose car was stolen? 
 - He claimed it was stolen. 
 Maybe it wasn't. 
 Was he part of the McMay case? 
 - No. 
 No. 
 Nothing to do with it.

 - What about it? 
 - And you had a bone marrow transplant  from a matched, unrelated donor,  someone who was not a relative. 
 - Yeah. 
 How do you know all this? 
 - In fact,  this was your donor,  Cory McMay. 
 He wasn't a drug addict then. 
 Just a nice 20-year-old who decided to help out a sick kid  by giving him some bone marrow. 
 - So here's the thing about you getting  a bone marrow transplant from Cory McMay. 
 It means that his DNA is inside of your system. 
 So a DNA test on your semen  could come back with Cory's DNA. 
 It's called a genetic chimera. 
 - Now eight years ago,  a woman was raped and killed, this woman. 
 And the DNA said McMay did it. 
 But that was wrong. 
 Because we found his DNA  on another victim this week.
