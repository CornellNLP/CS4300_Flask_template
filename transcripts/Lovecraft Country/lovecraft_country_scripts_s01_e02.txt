 You were a little... out of sorts when you arrived this morning.    
 When's my father expected to return from Boston?    
 I am afraid that I have already told you everything that I have been made privy to.    
 He left to see the lawyer with Miss Braithwhite two nights ago.

 Upon inheriting the land, Samuel Braithwhite decided to use it for his summer home, and never installed telephone lines so as not to be disturbed by the business that hounds him most of the year.     
 And what business does he have with my father?     
 I don't know, and it wouldn't be my place to say.     
 Is that the Samuel Braithwhite you've been speaking of?     
 That is a distant cousin of Samuel's, Ardham's founder, and the original owner of the lodge,     
 - Titus Braithwhite. 
- Hmm.     
 He built this retreat so that he and his fellow lodge members could dine in private.     
 He was quite an extraordinary man.     
 He must've been to build such an impressive home.     
 How did he come about his fortune?

 Titus was known to be notoriously kind to those who worked for him.     
 Hmm.     
 Many mourned after the great fire.     
 There was a fire?

 That won't be a problem, will it?     
 No, as long as you return in time for dinner.     
 Now, if you need anything else, anything at all, just ring the bell, and the butler will come running.     
 I thought you were the butler.     
 No.

 This here is one of my favorite paintings.     
 The artist, Josef Tannhauser, entitled it "Genesis  :  ."     
 Are either of you familiar with the verse?     
 ♪ ♪   
 "And out of the ground, the Lord God     
 "formed every beast of the field     
 "and every fowl of the air     
 "and brought them unto Adam     
 "to see what he would call them,     
 "and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof."     
 In Tannhauser's conception, this act of naming is more than a simple picking of labels.     
 Adam is sharing in creation, assigning each creature its final form and its station in the hierarchy of nature.     
 What does that mean, Christina?     
 What did Adam do?     
 He put everything in its place.     
 At the dawn of time, just for a moment, everything was where and as it should be... from God to man to woman, down to the lowliest wriggling creature.     
 It was Nirvana.     
 Then that stupid, meddlesome, troublemaking bitch Eve brought entropy and death.     
 What was an elegant hierarchy became a mess of tribes and nations.     
 Of course, it didn't really happen that way.     
 Biblical literalism is for the simple.     
 But I'm sure everyone in this room is aware of that.     
 It's still a useful parable for both of you.

 Our founder, Titus Braithwhite, was a son of a son, and we follow in his image, just as he followed in the first son's.     
 As Adam gave of his rib to create Eve, so did Titus give of himself to empower the founding members of the Order.     
 Tonight, on the precipice of great progress,     
 I honor him by giving of myself.

 I understand y'all belong to a club called the Order of Ancient Dawn.     
 I happened across your bylaws earlier this evening.     
 [crowd murmuring]     
 Now, I got some experience with fraternal societies, being a part of Prince Hall Freemasons myself.     
 Anybody know who Prince Hall was?     
 He was an abolitionist who joined the Massachusetts militia to fight for independence, and he wanted to join the local Freemasons, but, Tic, remind me why he wasn't allowed in.     
 Because he was a colored man.     
 I was not surprised to learn from your bylaws that your order wouldn't have admitted Prince Hall, either, but then I kept reading, and I found there's a loophole.     
 Men who are direct descendants of Titus are automatically members.     
 In fact, they're not just any old members.     
 
 
 
 They're what's called sons among sons, and as you all know, they can give orders to other, regular old members.     
 And seeing as I believe my nephew might just be the last blood heir of Titus Braithwhite...

 He believes he'll step through it into eternal life.

 Challenging entropy is perilous work, and the Language of Adam is a tricky thing to get right.     
 Many men have suffered greatly trying to wield it.     
 But the spelled blood of the man who wielded it best might just give my father's spell the advantage it needs.
