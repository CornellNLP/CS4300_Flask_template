 Previously on "Cardinal". 
 You embarrassed me in front of my students. 
 You wouldn't answer your phone. 
 I'm fine. 
 Tammy: Lise Delorme. 
 Yeah she was investigating him, thought he was dirty when he was covering up for your phone call. 
 All he ever wanted was to protect you. 
 Leon: You better not be using again, Kev. 
 I'm not. 
 (Scraping) 
 Cardinal: Anybody in the truck? 
 Fox: No, car's registered to Raymond Bedford. 
 Here he is. 
 Cardinal: Raymond Bedford. 
 Ray Northwind. 
 Clegg: You know what? You keep it. 
 I'm out. 
 There is no out. 
 You work for my now, alive or dead. 
 I want the redhead, where is she? 
 Clegg: In protective custody. 
 Dr. Wasserstein: This was inspired by Palo Mayombe, but that's not what this is. 
 What do you make of the missing body parts? 
 Dr. Wasserstein: You put them in your iron pot, you would need fresh blood to keep it working. 
 Cardinal: More sacrifices. 
 Dr. Wasserstein: The most potent time would be at new moon. 
 (Gasps) 
 Woman: Everyone out, now! (Beeping) 
 Ray: I didn't recognize her power before. 
 Bring her back to me. 
 I need her alive. 
 (Pulsing Dramatic Music) 
 Cardinal: Piper. 
 I need to see the security footage. 
 It's inside. 
 Uh, the Chief said the fire was contained to the shed. 
 We're good to go back in. 
 Lise, inside. 
 Delorme: I'll be right there. 
 They think the fire started in the crawl space. 
 That's him. 
 Leon Rutkowski. 
 Let's see that again. And slow it down. 
 We think he's the one who shot her. 
 Cardinal: Find anything? 
 Nothing to tell us where he took her. 
 Must have been watching the place, and picked his moment. 
 Somebody told him she was here. 
 Yeah, who? 
 The only people who knew she was here are the other women. 
 And our team. 
 (Pulsing Suspenseful Music) 
 We've got BOLOS out on Terri and Kevin Tait, Raymond Bedford, and Leon Rutkowski. 
 Delorme: He might be driving an older model blue car. 
 How did Leon know what shelter to hit? 
 Look, if anyone in this room said anything to anybody, now is the moment to speak up. 
 We're not going home until we find them. 
 Tomorrow is the new moon. 
 That's Bedford's favourite day for ritual sacrifice.

 Ray, I'm sorry. 
 I had only three rules. 
 I know. 
 When my mother tried to get clean. 
 She said it was like being ripped open. 
 Death would be a relief, wouldn't it? 
 Please. 
 (Sighs) 
 It's only going to get worse. 
 Given you enough, Kevin. 
 Now you're going to give me all your pain. 
 (Rapid Breathing) 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, okay, thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 John. 
 Went back over the Toronto unsolveds. 
 Ran them against the name 'Raymond Bedford'. 
 I might have something. Take a look. 
 Aaron Osborne. 
 His torso was found in the Don River, 2016. 
 Missing head, hands, and feet. 
 Same as Dave Elhurst. 
 What's the connection to Bedford? 
 McLeod: Both from Sudbury. So I checked. 
 They went to the same elementary school in grades two to five. 
 Nice work. 
 Get me everything you can on Osborne and anyone else who knew them both. 
 McLeod: Already on it. 
 Bedford has a sealed juvenile record. 
 He attacked his foster parent‐ She died of cancer two years ago. 
 I‐I managed to track down his social worker. 
 Sandra Mason. 
 She's on her way in. 
 You're on fire, McLeod. 
 Good. 
 (Ominous Instrumental) 
 ♪ They found your truck. 
 They know your real name. 
 They know that you threatened the chief in Moose Bay. 
 You gotta let the Tait girl go. 
 Alan, relax. 
 My work's not finished here. 
 Jesus, you gotta get out of here while you still can. 
 You're asking me to give up everything I've worked so hard for. 
 Clegg: I'm trying to protect you. 
 You're trying to run me out of town. 
 If you go down, I go down too. 
 Ray: What did you expect? 
 I get rid of Lasalle, you get rid of me? 
 You know, I‐ think you should get Evie a new bike. 
 'Cause that old red one is just too‐ it's too small for her. 
 (Chuckling) 
 (Sinister Instrumental) 
 Now. 
 Who am I supposed to be running from? 
 (Tense Instrumental) 
 ♪ It's John Cardinal. 
 Is Raymond Ojibwe? 
 His parents were Hungarian, I think. 
 Delorme: And you said he attacked you? 
 Fireplace poker. 
 When I told him he couldn't live with his mother anymore. 
 But you never reported it. 
 He was nine. 
 I wanted to believe it was an accident. 
 Can you give us any more specifics about Raymond? 
 You don't forget a kid like that. 
 Extremely bright. 
 Obsessed with death and religion, anything to do with the afterlife. 
 At first, I encouraged his curiosity, it was good to see a kid reading a book. 
 But then he asked me if I'd ever seen the inside of a cat. 
 And he went into graphic detail, how Leonardo da Vinci found god inside corpses. 
 And the look in his eye. 
 Did you ever see him hurt an animal? 
 Sandra: Catch him in the act? No. But, around that time, animals were going missing. 
 And after Raymond left‐ it stopped. 
 Where did he go? 
 Florida, I heard. 
 But he'd aged out of the system, so we didn't keep tabs. 
 Do you remember an Aaron Osborne? 
 He went to school with Raymond. 
 The kid he bashed with the shovel. 
 Yeah. What happened? 
 Sandra: Aaron called his mother a biker slut. 
 She was associated with bikers? 
 Mhm. 
 For years. 
 They passed her around 'til there was nothing left. 
 Delorme: Ray was 11 when he hit Aaron Osborne with a shovel. 
 Then he found him again in Toronto, 20 years later. 
 Hell of a grudge. 
 Sensitive about his mom. 
 Maybe that's why he targeted the Northern Raiders. 
 Payback. 
 So, he's fascinated with death and immortality and then he‐ he finds Palo Mayombe. 
 It would give a kid like him a sense of control over the chaos in his life. 
 He learns the basics in Sudbury, and then he goes to Florida to learn more. 
 That makes sense. 
 There's a Palo Mayombe community there. 
 I'll start to make some calls. 
 Catherine: A woman came to see me yesterday. 
 She assumed I knew John had been paying her to keep quiet about what I'd done. 
 Dr. Bell: What is it you did? 
 I made a call when I was manic and I blew an officer's cover. 
 John never told you. 
 He risked his job for me. 
 Dr. Bell: And how did you feel when you learned this? 
 A man is dead because of me. 
 How do you think I feel? 
 Devastated. 
 Shocked. 
 Furious. 
 Dr. Bell: With yourself. 
 With my illness. 
 With John for risking everything to protect me. 
 If he'd been caught, who would've been there for Kelly? 
 What did John say? 
 I haven't told him. 
 Dr. Bell: Why not? 
 He's heading a difficult investigation right now and he's already had to step away once. 
 You feel like a burden. 
 (Tapping) 
 Hey man, you got a second? 
 Yeah. That's about all I got. 
 What's up? 
 Commanda: I called your contact at the DEA in Michigan. 
 Why? 
 I couldn't get a hold of you. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. The ex got a job in Thunder Bay. 
 Thinks she can just take the kids. 
 Aw man, that sucks. 
 It is what it is. 
 Michigan didn't know anything about Bedford posing as Ray Northwind. 
 Well I haven't had a chance to update them since we last talked. 
 Lasalle's getting ready to make a move. 
 Commanda: They didn't know we had a new player in town. 
 Now they're up to date now. 
 Said they'd call if they got any leads on Bedford stateside. 
 Well, I appreciate that, Jerry. 
 But I gotta run. 
 Sure.

 ♪ Leon. 
 You gotta get me outta here, man. 
 (Leon Grunts) 
 Leon, we're friends.

 You betrayed him.

 ♪ 
 Secretary on Loudspeaker: Detective Gonzalez from Miami is on line two. 
 Thanks for getting back to us. 
 Detective Gonzales: I appreciate the call. 
 We've got a string of unsolveds dating back to 2008. 
 Missing heads, hands, feet. 
 All removed while the victim was alive. 
 Our guy likes coloured shells, sharpened sticks and chalk drawings of arrows and moons. 
 Yeah, some twisted version of Palo Mayombe. 
 Freaked the hell out of the Cuban community here. 
 They call them 'El Brujo'. 
 The witch. 
 When was the last case? 
 Detective Gozales: It's been quiet since 2016. 
 That's when they found Osborne in Toronto. 
 Have you ever questioned uh, a guy named Raymond Bedford? 
 I don't recognize the name. 
 But we got unknown DNA at one of the scenes. 
 If you catch this guy, let me know. 
 We're working on that. 
 Detective Gonzales: We spent eight years trying to nail him. 
 Say what you want, he's got some kinda power on his side. 
 Cardinal: Thanks for all your help. 
 Detective Gonzales: Buena suerte. 
 Cardinal: I've seen that before. 
 (Phone Ringing) 
 Hi. 
 Cardinal: Hey. I need your help with something. 
 You took a photo of a wooden eagle. 
 Rotting. Low angle. 
 You remember that? 
 Oh yes. 
 You okay? 
 Fine. I know the shot you mean. 
 Where'd you take it? 
 Catherine: Um, I'm not sure exactly. 
 Somewhere off 64. 
 I got lost looking for the Lynx Creek headwaters. 
 Cardinal: Which side of 64? 
 Uh, is it a side road? 
 Dirt? Paved? 
 Anything you can recall will be helpful. 
 East I think. 
 South of 17. 
 Um, dirt road. 
 Uh, private property. 
 There were 'No Trespassing' signs. 
 The eagle was on a gatepost. 
 Cardinal: Was there anything else? 
 You see any cottages? Any vehicles? 
 Anything. 
 Catherine: Nothing but trees. 
 Um, there was a dead birch, black and silver at the side of the road. 
 Looks like it was hit by lightning. 
 I shot it. Do you remember? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I think I do. 
 That's just before the turn off. 
 Is this about the missing woman? 
 I have to go. Talk later? 
 Focus on what you need to do. 
 Thanks. Bye. 
 Bye.
