 Previously on "Cardinal". 
 Cardinal: What did you see? 
 A white guy with blonde hair. 
 Kevin: You saw Terri get on the bus, right? 
 Leon: I dropped her at the station. 
 Tammy: But my prints are all over that kilo of coke. 
 Make the fingerprints disappear, and I'll tell you what I got on Cardinal. 
 Cardinal: We have confirmation. 
 A rival moving in on the Northern Raiders drug trade. 
 Jordan: I didn't know he was a dealer. 
 Commanda: Is there anything at all that you can tell us about him? 
 Jordan: He had like this crazy tooth. 
 The Northern Raiders don't own this town anymore. 
 Leon: Toof. 
 Ray: Keep your mouth shut about our plans. 
 (Boom) 
 No! 
 Ray: Never lose control. 
 (Whacking) 
 Ray: No one uses our product. 
 Break any of my rules and I kill ya. 
 Cardinal: You left your meds at home. 
 Please, step back from the edge. 
 Catherine: I'm working. 
 Jesus, John. 
 Go home!

 What have we got? 
 Vic's been dead between twelve and twenty‐four hours. 
 Cause of death, either blunt force trauma or gunshot wound. 
 You'll understand when you see the body. 
 This must be the kill site. 
 Cardinal: You get a match on that and you call me right away. 
 Delorme: Hey. 
 When did you get back? 
 Last night. 
 Call Ballistics, Ash. 
 Give them a heads up we got something coming in. 
 I want a quick turnaround on this. 
 (Eerie Instrumental) 
 ♪ Hey guys, check this out. 
 Can I tell you how good I am? 
 Maggot casing? 
 Irrefutably. 
 What's so exciting? 
 The distance from the flesh. 
 Maggots will eventually fall off a dead body. 
 But this little guy was eight feet from the corpse. 
 Right inside a footprint. 
 Looks like a work boot. 
 Like the one Terri saw at the cave maybe. 
 Harris: Size 10, I'd wager. 
 Yeah, but why would a guy have a maggot casing on his boot? 
 Harris: My question exactly, which is why I'm taking this to the master of entomology. 
 Chin. 
 He'll be ecstatic. 
 (Suspenseful Music) 
 ♪ Delorme: The guy has an extra incisor. 
 Rachel Wells bought heroin from a dealer with a tooth like that. 
 She OD'd. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No one stood up for her. 
 You did. 
 Delorme: It wasn't enough. 
 Jordan, her boyfriend, said that she bought the drugs at the Corner Pocket. 
 From a guy who had a‐ what do you call it‐ a snaggletooth? 
 So maybe he's one of the new dealers trying to cut out the bikers. 
 Lasalle's boys find him, beat some intel out of him. 
 Shoot him. 
 Or the other way around. 
 You knock somebody out and then shoot him, that's one kind of person. 
 You put two bullets in their brain and then bash their head in, what does that make you? 
 Sadistic. 
 Or maybe the owner of defective bullets. 
 I'm betting on both. 
 Thought you'd be happy. 
 I got no complaints with you putting Lasalle out of business. 
 Ray: Hey, did it together, Alan. 
 No. 
 A couple bikers get roughed up in a turf war, nobody looks too closely at that. 
 But the mutilation, the sacrifice, I can't be part of that, Ray. 
 You're a big part of it. 
 You've earned this. 
 It's just the beginning. 
 You know what, you keep it. 
 I'm out. 
 There is no out. Take it or leave it. 
 I held up my end of the deal. 
 You work for me now, Alan. 
 Alive or dead. 
 It's your choice. 
 So, what do ya got for me? 
 Cops found, uh, your friend Toof with his head caved in. 
 Ray: What else? 
 Clegg: Been looking for Leon's truck. 
 (Ray Clears Throat) 
 What about the redhead? 
 Terri Tait? 
 So you did shoot her. 
 The hell'd you do that for? 
 She had nothing to do with Lasalle. 
 Where is she? 
 She's in protective custody. 
 I don't even know where. 
 Find her.

 (Office Noise) 
 Delorme: So, Jordan gave us a description of Rachel Wells's dealer. 
 I followed up at the Corner Pocket, one of the regulars ID'd him as "Toof". 
 Sergeant? 
 Dyson: Who is this? 
 Delorme: Our shooting vic. 
 There's only one "Toof" alias in Northern Ontario, Morris Tilley. 
 Local. Low level pot dealer. 
 Is he connected with the Northern Raiders? 
 Cardinal: Ah, Clegg says no. 
 But we do think he's connected to a drug operation who are taking over from the bikers. 
 We're still digging. 
 Sounds promising. 
 (Knocking) 
 Mrs. Tilley: Morris is a good boy, you know, maybe too fond of that marijuana. 
 I‐I‐I tell him all the time to lay off. 
 Always puts you in a fog. 
 Mrs. Tilley. 
 I'm sorry but your son is dead. 
 We found him this morning on the edge of the forest, just off the 17. 
 What? 
 No. 
 No, he's not. 
 He was just here the other day wolfing down a sandwich. 
 No, your son was murdered. 
 He's a sweet boy. 
 He never hurt anybody. 
 Could you tell us about anyone he was friends with, um might have been hanging around with. 
 I don't know. 
 Ah, he moved out two months ago. 
 Was he living with anyone? 
 Um... (Rapid Breathing) 
 Leon ah‐ah‐ah something. 
 And uh‐ a native friend. 
 A fancy name. 
 Uh, Toof said he was psychic. 
 Um‐ Northwind. 
 Yeah, that was it. 
 (Snivelling) 
 Do you have family or friends nearby? 
 You shouldn't be alone right now. 
 (Foreboding Instrumental) 
 Kevin: Is‐is Terri there? 
 Terri Tait. 
 She works there. 
 I'm her brother. 
 Yeah. 
 The‐ The‐the cops said what? 
 No. No, thank you. 
 That's fine. 
 Thank you.

 ♪ 
 ♪ 
 (Rock Music) (Bar Chatter) 
 ♪ Give me a sec. 
 Well I'd offer you a beer but uh, you probably shouldn't drink. 
 You're sending your boys to the rez looking for drug dealers. 
 Tell me what you know about the guys moving in on your territory. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You think they're Native. 
 Why? 
 I know how close you and Wombat were. 
 They cut off your brother's head off, man. 
 So tell me what you know. 
 And then what? 
 We can offer you protection. 
 Before this escalates. 
 I'm sorry, man, I can't help you. 
 Fine. 
 The offer remains. 
 In the meantime, you set one more foot on my rez, I'm coming for ya.

 (Melancholy Pulsing Music) 
 ♪ Dr. Chin: I can now link your first body to your second body through DNA results. 
 Delorme: But we didn't give you DNA. 
 Dr. Chin: Abby Harris gave me a maggot casing. 
 We have the same DNA at both sites. 
 Cardinal: Whose DNA? 
 The fly's. 
 Delorme: So the same species of fly can be found at both sites. 
 Dr. Chin: No. 
 The DNA of the same individual fly. 
 The maggot that came out of this casing, found in the footprint at the second murder site, has the same mother as dozens of other eggs found at the first site. 
 Cardinal: Chin's evidence confirms that Toof's killer was also at the waterfall. 
 We're waiting on ballistics, but I'm betting the bullets in Toof's brain match the one in Terri's. 
 Clegg: So you got one guy shooting people and dumping the bodies. 
 And another guy who's chopping up his vics to gain spiritual power. 
 Delorme: At least two. 
 Working together. 
 And the ritualistic one likes to make his sacrifices under a new moon. 
 Sacrifices? 
 That's definitely not part of any Native ceremony that I know of. 
 Any suspects? 
 Cardinal: Toof's mom said he was staying with a "Leon" and a, a Native guy named "Northwind". 
 Doesn't ring any bells. 
 Northwind is a big name on the Moose Bay rez. 
 We think that the heroin's being shipped up from a rez in Michigan, right? 
 (Pulsing Suspenseful Music) 
 Yeah. 
 Commanda: This could be a brotherhood thing. 
 Native dealer wants to do business with his own people. 
 So he gets rid of the white guy. 
 Cardinal: Could be how Northwind cuts out the bikers. 
 We have two days until the new moon. 
 We have to find Leon and Northwind before then. 
 It's been a while since I've been to Moose Bay. 
 Clegg: Hey. 
 Hm? 
 Clegg: I heard about Rachel. 
 I should've pulled her out sooner. 
 Yeah.

 ♪ You're lucky. 
 The drugs were incinerated. 
 Only thing left was a fingerprint card and a photo of the prints. 
 So. 
 You had something to tell me. 
 Yeah. 
 (Menacing Instrumental) 
 Cardinal: I have a friend works in lock‐up. 
 She says you signed out a box of cold case files but failed to mention you'd hidden another case inside of it. 
 Things get misfiled all the time. 
 Cardinal: You lied. 
 You stole evidence. 
 And you're on tape. 
 You are exactly what I thought you were. 
 Lise Delorme is an excellent investigator. 
 NIS will be happy to have her. 
 She was good. 
 I'm sorry I put her in your path. 
 They make their decision today, don't they? 
 Chief Northwind? 
 That's me. 
 Jerry Commanda. 
 (In Ojibwe) Ndishnikaaz. 
 Aaniishna Nishkaa? 
 You're OPD. 
 Out of Algonquin Bay. 
 I'm trying to locate a man by the name of Northwind. 
 But I don't know his first name. 
 And we think he's taken over the heroin trade in Algonquin Bay. 
 Northwinds are good people. 
 Traditional. 
 You ever heard of uh‐ 
 the Northern Raiders? 
 You see, a few days ago we found the severed head of one them in some drug dealer's house. 
 We think that Northwind has something to do with it. 
 Without a first name, I really can't help you. 
 Respectfully, I think you can. 
 I got nothing to say. 
 Did he threaten you? 
 Yesterday I took the body of a girl to the morgue. 
 She overdosed on heroin probably sold to her from this guy. 
 He's killing children. 
 All I need is his name. 
 Ray. 
 Ray Northwind. 
 He's not one of us. 
 Where's he from? 
 The guy just turned up here one day, he showed me his status card. 
 Wanted me to say that I was his uncle. 
 Said some Peter Crowchild was gonna call, Chippewa from Iron River. 
 I had to say that he was born and raised here. 
 What did you say? 
 What do you think? 
 Kicked him out. 
 The next day, I wake up. 
 There was this sound at the door. 
 You ever hear the sound a dog makes with his paws cut off? 
 My grandkids over there. 
 He knew their names. 
 (Knocking) 
 Ah‐ I'm looking for John Cardinal. 
 Ah, he's not here. 
 You must be Catherine. 
 How do you know John? 
 I'm Tammy. 
 Lidstrom. 
 I used to go out with Kyle Corbett. 
 Ah‐ Can‐can you just‐ Can you give this to John? 
 Tell him I can't take it. 
 You look like you could use a cup of tea. 
 Tammy: I burned through the last of the money John gave me. 
 And I didn't know what I was going to do and, then he called. 
 Said his partner was paying the price for what he did. 
 Lise Delorme? 
 Yeah, she was investigating him. 
 Thought he was dirty. 
 When he was covering up for your phone call. 
 I know he felt responsible for that officer's death, but all he ever wanted was to protect you. 
 And I used that. 
 I don't want to be that person anymore.

 I'm parking the truck for now. 
 Leon: You gave me that truck.

 I'll have an address for you.

 Kular: Leon Rutkowski. 
 Did eight years for running heroin and aggravated assault. 
 In Collins Bay. 
 His time overlapped Kevin Tait's. 
 How many Leons in Algonquin Bay with both assault and drug charges on their record? 
 He's the only one. 
 Don't suppose he owns a black truck? 
 No vehicles registered under his name.
