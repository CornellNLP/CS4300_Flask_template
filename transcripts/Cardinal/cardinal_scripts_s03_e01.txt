 Yes. 
 But she also told me you'd made up. 
 She felt good about you two. 
 There were no signs, none that I could see, I-I would have taken steps. 
 So then- something happened afterward then, something to trigger her. 
 She always had to struggle, John, you know that.

 Mail said the Schumachers. 
 It's a handgun, looks like nine millimetres, same as the casings. 
 Another round in there. 
 Inside, we've got prints around the jimmied door. 
 Same ones on the broken picture, one of the glasses, and a partial on a bullet casing. 
 Delorme: But he's not in the system. 
 So, victims knew the killer, they had a drink with him, and then what? 
 Something happens. 
 Someone gets upset. 
 A struggle. 
 A gun comes out.

 Two head shots.

 They ran this way. 
 Footprints. 
 Two sets outside the house. 
 One belongs to the killer, boots, men size 10. 
 The others are smaller, women's 6. 
 So where does she go? 
 Harris: Looks like she made it to a vehicle and escaped under fire. 
 Delorme: The rain that day helped. 
 We've got three distinct sets of tire tracks.

 And one survivor. 
 That's now up to five we can put in the house.

 These tires come stock with this car? 
 Uh, those, no, they're um, they're-they're an upgrade. 
 Yeah, we'll compare them to the tracks we found at the Island Road house. 
 Your open house. Mhm. 
 How was that game by the way? 
 Troy: Leafs tanked it again. 
 The Richter penalty cost them the whole thing.

 Great minds think alike I guess. 
 You ever visit any of Randall's listings? 
 Troy: Yeah, I've-I've helped him out with a place or two, yeah, clean it up. 
 What about a house on Island Road? 
 No, no, um, mostly just places here in town.

 So whoever has this printer- 
 Not that simple. 
 It's a cartridge flaw, which means as soon as the ink runs out he gets a new cartridge you can't pin him to these anymore. 
 I need to find him before the ink runs out? 
 I'll print up the analysis.

 Give me a few minutes, I'll let you know what I can find out. 
 Um. 
 So, I brushed over the birthday reminder and toner. 
 And as you can see the ink is on the indentations from the suicide note. 
 So the note came before the list? 
 Tawny: It's weird. 
 Writing a suicide note, then turning the page over to write a to-do list. 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 That's what I thought too. 
 Tawny: But, on the other hand, she did write a suicide note so it seems like she was intending to do it.

 Just vanished. 
 What do they think happened? 
 Signs of struggle. 
 Blood from all three in the house. 
 But they never found any bodies. 
 Not on land anyway, and back then the lake was too deep to drag.

 You were right to focus our search on the lake. 
 But it doesn't make sense with this one.
