 Previously on "Cardinal". 
 Irena Barstow and Roman Barstow. 
 Their bodies were recovered from Trout Lake yesterday morning. 
 Randall Wishart? 
 Can you tell us where you were two nights ago? 
 Uh, I was at my buddy Troy's place. 
 Randall, he killed two people. 
 I saw him at school today. 
 Randall, he has my phone. 
 I'll-I'll figure something out. 
 This is a message for Detective Delorme. 
 What kind of person writes and sends that kind of card? 
 You think this person had something to do with Catherine's death. 
 Everyone you've put behind bars going back to 2010. 
 I appreciate your discretion. 
 Fancy couple got murdered up on, uh, Island Road, dumped in the lake. 
 Henry. 
 It's okay, it's late. 
 I can start the fire myself. 
 You sure? Yeah. 
 Good night Henry. 
 Three different ATMs, three victims, all in the last week. 
 Stop! Are you okay? 
 You forget something? 
 Who are you? 
 Lets all just settle in. 
 Got plenty of time to get to know each other. 
 Mama wants you to know this isn't personal. 
 ♪ 
 ♪ Hey, is there anybody out there? 
 Henry, are you out there?! 
 ♪ You weren't supposed to kill them until after you had the weapons. 
 You get too excited. You like it too much. 
 I put my gun on the woman, like you told me. 
 I said to give us what we wanted or I'd kill her. 
 But he came at me. 
 It's because he wasn't afraid of you. 
 I put him down, and then- 
 I just- 
 I got all mixed up. 
 Yeah. 
 You saw red again. 
 And you killed her too. 
 She could've told us things! 
 The next thing I knew I was carrying the bodies to the boat. 
 If you want to prove that you can be a good lieutenant you need to learn control, Jack. 
 I know. You know. 
 You've set us back. 
 We can't build North Haven without those guns. 
 I know. 
 Alright, so what are you gonna do about it? 
 They said that they're in the storage. 
 I have the key to the locker but I just, don't know where it is yet. 
 I promise I'll fix this. 
 I know you will.

 Dad? 
 Hey! 
 Hello. 
 Hey. You're home. 
 Yeah. 
 It's Thanksgiving weekend. 
 You didn't remember. 
 No, I didn't, I didn't. 
 I didn't forget. Sure. 
 Uh, good to see ya. 
 You've been busy, I guess. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Cold case files. 
 Uh, working just makes the house seem less, The Scrivers? 
 That was like a bogeyman story when I was a kid. 
 They never found them, right? 
 No, no, they never did. 
 Murder, missing, murder. 
 Yeah I can see how this would cheer you up. 
 You shouldn't really be looking at that stuff. 
 Why do you have this? 
 Because Lise returned your mother's effects. 
 You shouldn't keep that, dad. 
 And we should really think about giving some of her stuff away. 
 Yeah, well, first we have to pick out some photos for your mother's memorial, all right. 
 So, one thing at a time. 
 Okay. Let's do it this weekend, then. 
 Alright. Just, not now. 
 I have to go to work. 
 I, I thought that, Well, I don't want to but they, they need me. 
 ♪ 
 Missed you this morning. 
 I was up late looking at the case. 
 Any luck with the Barstow's rental car? 
 No. 
 Not easy being the boss. 
 It's fine. 
 Come inside. 
 I want to talk about Randall Wishart. 
 So Randall hasn't come in. 
 But still you don't think he's our guy. 
 No. But we both know he's lying. 
 So the young woman at the house, you think she was there for him? 
 You're a married realtor, an empty house is a good place to take your mistress. 
 So the prints on the headboard are his. 
 And the blue fibre, maybe they put something down on the bed. 
 Okay, so he meets this woman for s*x. 
 He leaves, she stays for some reason, and then hell breaks loose downstairs. 
 It would explain why she hasn't come forward. 
 She's protecting him. 
 And he's letting her, even though she's risking her life. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You wouldn't see me any other way. 
 Look, I don't want it to be this way. 
 But I'm trying to protect us, both of us. 
 The cops have already been here. 
 We need to tell them what happened. 
 This is my life, Sam. 
 Two people are dead. 
 What about them? 
 We can't change that. 
 I called the police. 
 What did you just say? 
 It was anonymous. 
 I used a pay phone. 
 Well you didn't see anything. 
 What can that possibly do but hurt us? 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 We're gonna be together. 
 I'm gonna leave her, I promise. 
 We just gotta get this behind us, okay? 
 The killer, he called me. 
 I know it was him. 
 I need you to tell me exactly what happened with the police. 
 What did you tell them? 
 Did you mention my name? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Go, just go. 
 You can't be seen around here. 
 Mama's making breakfast. 
 I'll be right up. 
 You shouldn't get used to all this. 
 It's not gonna be comfortable where we're headed. 
 That's why I should enjoy it right now. 
 This isn't a vacation, Nikki. 
 You need to find a way to be useful. 
 Lemur's useful. 
 I'm useful, You're so useful. 
 Where are the guns you were supposed to get for us? 
 You could always go back to where we found you. 
 Giving dirty old men rides for pocket change. 
 Mama's not gonna like you messing with her. 
 Just trying to toughen her up. 
 It's not your place. 
 At least I'm not in love with her. 
 Jack. 
 Detectives, hi. 
 I just realized I, uh, dropped the ball on swinging by. 
 Well you're in luck, Mr. Wishart. 
 You can come with us now. 
 Now, uh, now is not great for me. 
 Oh. 
 Should we go ask your boss, Ms. Carnwright, when would be a good time for you? 
 And I don't have a mistress. 
 I mean, you've seen Laura, I'd have to be an idiot. 
 We meet lots of idiots in here. 
 We have tracks that match your tires. 
 Uh, we have your fingerprints on the realty sign, and where else? 
 Ensuite bathroom sink. 
 The master bed headboard. 
 Mmm. A lot of prints there. 
 Yep. 
 He adjusted the headboard for a showing weeks ago. 
 He used the bathroom. 
 And there are plenty of those tires out there. 
 Listen. 
 We don't care who you sleep with. 
 But right now there's a woman out there, and she's in danger. 
 So if you know anything about it, you need to help us protect her. 
 We done? 
 ♪ Hm. 
 ♪ 
 ♪ Jack grew up doing it, you and Lemur are gonna have to learn how to hunt and forage and trap. 
 I don't know if I wanna kill some bambi or something. 
 Nikki. 
 You relied on others to look after you and they nearly used you up. 
 It's not gonna happen again. 
 Not with one of my warriors. 
 Eat your breakfast. 
 Can I teach Nikki the fighting stuff? 
 Later. First I need you to set some traps on the perimeter of the property. 
 Traps for what? 
 Anything that needs catching. 
 You doing more ATMs today? 
 Mama told me to lay off. 
 She seemed mad. 
 Jack must've done something that messed up. 
 Yeah. Kid's not wired right. 
 You gotta be careful Leems, he'll hurt you. 
 I just feel sorry for him sometimes. 
 God, why. 
 He's just, 
 He just wants to be normal. 
 She won't let him hurt us. 
 He's scared of her. He's not scared of her. 
 He loves her. 
 Loves her like she was his real mom. 
 She's better than his real mom. 
 Mine too. 
 She saved me. 
 You believe in her, right? 
 She's the strongest person I ever met. 
 I wish it was just the three of us. 
 Or, you know, just the two of us. 
 I gotta check this trap. 
 Gotcha. Gotcha. 
 ♪ 
 ♪ John. 
 John. 
 John. 
 I think you should hear this. 
 ♪ So, after the press conference last night, we got 39 messages with anonymous tips. 
 This was one of the last. 
 This is a message for Detective Delorme. 
 I saw you on the news. 
 I was there the night that the murders happened. 
 I broke in to steal stuff, and some people came in, and I heard shouting, and then shooting. 
 And a man chased me, a, a white man. 
 I think he's been following me. 
 That's all I know, all right. 
 I hope it helps. 
 So what do you think? 
 The way she said 'white man'. 
 Well if she lives on the reserve, the chances are pretty good she doesn't trust Algonquin Bay cops. 
 We believe her, about stealing stuff? 
 No. 
 No, I think Randall's girlfriend has more of a conscience than he does. 
 So where did he meet this girl? 
 He's not selling houses on the reservation. 
 The real estate office, it's full of indigenous art. 
 Laura Carnwright is one of my biggest supporters. 
 Has been since I opened. 
 And what about her husband, Randall Wishart. 
 Does he come around much? 
 No, no not really. 
 I mean, he's been to, uh, a, a few openings with her. 
 John, I'm so sorry, Marla, do you remember if Randall, um, interacted with anyone while he was here, anyone other than his wife? 
 Uh, um, let me think, um, A couple of months ago we had someone from, uh, a cute little cook from The Champlain Pub make Indigenous fusion, um, bannock tacos, caribou sliders, like that. 
 You remember her name? 
 No. I'm sorry, I, I never spoke to her. 
 John, Marla, thanks for your time. 
 John, it's not your fault. 
 Catherine was depressed, she was suffering. 
 You couldn't have saved her. Nobody could. 
 I know how hard this must be for you. 
 Do you? 
 Hey! 
 Is there anybody out there! 
 Lloyd Kreeger. 
 You want to tell me what all this noise is about? 
 Where's Henry? 
 Henry? 
 Your friend. 
 He left. 
 Quite the castle you've built for yourself here. 
 Nice pictures of your daughter and her kid. 
 No clothes or toys though. 
 They must not visit very often, huh? 
 And all those awards in your office, all that money. 
 It's easy to tell what went wrong there, huh. 
 Money. 
 Is that what you want? 
 What I want right now is silence. 
 So, if you can be quiet for a little bit, I'll think about moving you somewhere more comfortable. 
 Look, we can be friendly, Lloyd. 
 Or, I can fill this tub with ice water and you can breathe through a straw. 
 Am I clear? 
 And I'm not interested in your money. 
 You've got one thing I want. 
 But right now, 
 quiet. 
 Hey! 
 What are you doing? 
 Looking for my mom's locker but I forgot what number it is. 
 Got the key right here. 
 So call her. 
 I tried. 
 Can't reach her. 
 She wants her crockpot and I can't come back empty-handed, you know? 
 Doesn't matter how old you get, your mom's still on your ass. 
 Hey, maybe I can give you her name and you can give me the locker number? 
 I can't give you that information. 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. 
 What did you say your name was again? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I hope this isn't weird but, 
 you smell really good. 
 What is that cologne? 
 Look, if you don't go, I'm going to call the cops. 
 Now you're calling the cops? 
 I tried to be nice. 
 I paid you a compliment. 
 I'm going to count back from ten. Ten, 9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. 
 Zero. 
 You're not funny. 
 No, I'm not. 
 But I'm just gonna check these last three lockers, boss. 
 And then I'll walk away. 
 Deal? 
 Just-just do it quickly. 
 That's my man. 
 I need the names of any and all of your staff who worked the event. 
 Well no, I-I'd, uh, I'd like to hold, uh, if you don't mind getting those for me now. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, that name you wanted me to run, Connor Plaskett? 
 You found him? 
 Mr. Plaskett was living in Sudbury last December when his live-in girlfriend reported him missing on his snowmobile. 
 He stayed missing until, uh, spring thaw when they found him. 
 Death by misadventure. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 He an Island Road suspect? 
 Uh, you have those, um, names for me now? 
 Yeah, good, I'll, um, write them down. 
 It's Neil Codwallader. 
 Put him away a few years ago for assault, road rage incident. 
 Huh. Codwallader's one of my success stories. 
 He seem angry, bitter? 
 Christ, Cardinal, they're ex-cons. 
 They're all angry and bitter. 
 There something I should know? 
 No. Just checking in. 
 I want the document on this printed. 
 Okay. No problem. 
 ♪ I don't want any trouble. 
 I'm in compliance. 
 All right. Talk to my P.O. 
 ♪ Okay. 
 ♪ Again, I want this document printed on every machine in the shop. 
 Okay. 
 That should be all of them. 
 I'll go get the pages. 
 Neil. Did you send the cards? 
 What cards? 
 Did you send the cards. 
 Man, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I messed up. 
 You sent me to jail. 
 But I'm out, alright, I'm clean.

 Okay. 
 This was at Truscott Gallery. 
 July 14th of this year. 
 Just wondering if you happened to meet a Laura Carnwright. 
 Or, a Randall Wishart? 
 Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.

 You want to tell me about Neil Codwallader? 
 Not really.

 I had reason to believe that Mr. Codwallader was involved in criminal harassment. 
 I heard you got some nasty cards. 
 But you cannot open up an investigation all by yourself, John, no matter how much you're hurting. 
 Especially one involving your own wife. 
 Other things have come to light. 
 Other things. 
 I don't believe she killed herself. 
 You could've come to me.

 I'm there, John. 
 This isn't like with your sister. 
 Catherine wasn't sick. 
 Yes she was. 
 You knew she was. 
 Did she know about this?

 Your partner accused a parolee today of harassment over Catherine's death. 
 The cards? 
 So you did know. 
 Will you excuse us, please? 
 Well you know how he gets. 
 He's not gonna let this go. 
 And if it comes out, every-every single case that he has touched is gonna be in jeopardy. 
 Cardinal's been there every time we needed him. 
 We found the bodies when we did because of him. 
 This is just his way of coping. 
 Well, it's gotta stop. 
 I'll talk to him. 
 You haven't known him as long as I have. 
 It's not gonna be as easy as you think. 
 We got the girl from the voice mail. 
 Maybe the killer too. 
 You left me a message? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it was me. 
 I want to talk to you about the man who chased you tonight.

 Hm. 
 But I don't understand. 
 You chased her tonight, wearing a mask. 
 Look, Randall got me the rink job but I'm done covering for the guy.

 That's new. 
 That man, he's really a murderer? 
 Detective Delorme will need to speak to Sam about that, but, So if you don't mind stepping out with me. 
 This is going to be hard for you to hear. 
 Is Randall okay? 
 As far as I'm concerned, no he isn't. 
 Sam, the man who chased you, he wasn't the killer. 
 He was Randall's friend, Troy Campbell. 
 Do you know him? 
 Troy? Mhm.

 Why would he do that to me? 
 Because Randall asked him to.
