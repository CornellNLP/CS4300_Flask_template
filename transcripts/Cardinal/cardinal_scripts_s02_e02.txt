 (GunShot) Previously on "Cardinal". 
 ER Doctor: The bullet entered the victim's left temporal lobe. 
 Commanda: So lobotomy by gunshot. 
 What do you see? 
 Red: Over there. Moons. 
 Dr. Schaff: Got it. 
 Delorme: Do you know her? 
 Rachel: I don't think so. 
 Delorme: What about hanging around the Northern Raiders? 
 Your biker friends. 
 I haven't been around them in six months. 
 Catherine: We leave Friday morning, back Sunday night. 
 You sure about this? 
 Catherine: You don't need to worry. 
 Delorme: I want to apply for training with the National Intelligence Service. 
 Musgrave: You put National Intelligence Service on the resume and sky's the limit. 
 You gonna tank your career for Cardinal? 
 Delorme: Who knew you had this gun? 
 My friend Dave. 
 Marci: I haven't seen Dave in almost two weeks. 
 Is this the boat he's out on? 
 Marci: Yeah. The "Muskee‐Doe". 
 Cardinal: The sooner she remembers who she is‐ Dr. Paley: She hasn't forgotten who she is. 
 She just can't retrieve the information right now. 
 Cardinal: Where was that photo taken? 
 Dr. Paley: Beaufort Hill. 
 Cardinal: I got something. 
 A cave by the waterfall. 
 (Mournful Instrumental) 
 ♪ 
 ♪ There's way fewer maggots than I'd expect. 
 Delorme: Found another one of these in the bush. 
 Looks like blood. 
 Cardinal: We'll test it against the victim's. 
 Delorme: Not much blood on the ground. 
 Barnhouse: This might not be the kill site. 
 Ah, this is some sort of sacrifice. 
 A ritual. 
 Barnhouse: Okay. You guys could come on over and take a closer look now. 
 Genitalia's been removed. 
 Mhm. 
 Delorme: Compass rose. 
 Same as the one in the photo at the marina. 
 Barnhouse: You know who it is? 
 Dave Elhurst. 
 Our only suspect in a shooting three days ago. 
 Lise. 
 When Red was in surgery, she said, "Over there. Pointing. 
 Moons." 
 McLeod: I found this. 
 The nearest train tracks are at least six kilometres away. 
 Not exactly sharp enough to be a murder weapon. 
 Doesn't mean the killer didn't bring it. 
 Commanda: Ugh, you called? 
 Yeah, I uh, I wanted you to have a look at this. 
 (Eerie Instrumental) 
 ♪ 
 Commanda: Good thing you called me, man. 
 McLeod: See? I knew it had to be a Native thing. 
 Oh yeah, definitely. 
 Okay. So, 
 what do the markings mean? 
 Well, they refer to time and space. 
 Roughly translates to 
 "I'll meet you at Tim Hortons, three p. m. on Saturday." 
 I don't know, I'm not an expert on cave drawings, Ian. 
 You know, believe it or not, with all those bows and arrows and stuff, you might want to talk to somebody in Behavioural Sciences. 
 We've got a guy at OPD. 
 I'll hook you up. 
 Yeah.

 I hope not.

 For Catherine. 
 How'd your interview go? 
 I won't get it. 
 Dr. Chin: Beautiful morning. 
 Delorme: Dr. Chin, Detective Lise Delorme. 
 Cardinal: Cardinal. 
 You looked at the bugs we found on our victim? 
 Dr. Chin: Mainly Phormia Regina. 
 A blowfly, common everywhere. 
 Then there was Calliphora Vicina, which is rarer. 
 They mostly go places that are shady and cool. 
 I assume that fits with the crime scene? 
 Your body also contained maggots of Cynomoyopsis Cadavarina, or the shiny bluebottle. 
 You only get that fly in the advanced stages of decay. 
 But those were the only three species we found. 
 You're surprised. 
 Well, normally, you'd expect a lot more species at an outdoor site. 
 Especially in the late stages. 
 The body was found in a‐a cave. 
 Dr. Chin: Near water? 
 Yeah. 
 The flies didn't smell the body. 
 Didn't even know it was there. 
 The bugs you did find. 
 Can they give us time of death? 
 Yes, thanks to the bluebottle. 
 Your victim was killed approximately twelve days ago. 
 (Dramatic Instrumental) 
 Thanks. 
 Good luck. Delorme: Thank you. 
 Dave was already missing his head when Red was shot. 
 So he didn't shoot her. 
 But he crossed paths with whoever did. 
 (Eerie Instrumental) 
 ♪ 
 (Door Opening & Closing) 
 You were gone early. 
 Yeah, I went up Beaufort Hill. 
 Cops have been there. 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 They only found one body. 
 Told you that girl was still alive. 
 But you said she was dead. 
 Leon: She is, Ray. 
 She's halfway down the hillside. 
 In the trees. 
 Surprised that the, uh, cops didn't find her. 
 Yeah. 
 Ah, anyways, I buried her deep. 
 I know you've been wanting to ask. 
 Go ahead. 
 Jesus. 
 Must've hurt like a mother! 
 Every crack of my whip brought me into my power. 
 You did that to yourself? 
 Discipline, Leon. 
 Mind, body and spirit. 
 We have appetites, you and me. 
 Cardinal: How's her memory coming? 
 Dr. Paley: Short term's improving. 
 Nothing before her trauma. 
 Delorme: Will it all come back at once? 
 Every case is unique. 
 Memories are stored in many traces in the brain. 
 Some more accessible than others. 
 How ya feeling? 
 Well, someone tried to kill me. 
 I don't know if it was some rando, or my boyfriend, or if I even have a boyfriend. 
 We're working on that. 
 Just try to relax. 
 Do they think that I'm dead? 
 Or are they going to try again? 
 (Cicadas Humming) (Birds Singing) 
 (Ethereal Instrumental) 
 ♪ 
 You're going in early. 
 Cardinal: I was trying not to wake you. 
 Birds beat you to it. 
 You need anything for your trip? 
 Catherine: I'm all set. 
 I‐I'm thinking about taking a break from therapy. 
 Don't look at me like that. 
 I mean, you've said that in the past. 
 God, John. Relax. 
 I'm not saying I won't go back. 
 Well then what's the problem, then? 
 Is it‐ Is it Dr. Bell? 
 No. I‐I feel like I'm going over the same things, again and again. 
 I'm‐I'm so sick of hearing myself talk. 
 I just need a break. 
 I think it's a bad idea. 
 (Melancholic Instrumental) 
 ♪ Marci: All right, remember to keep your skin covered, Black flies. 
 Have fun! 
 (Ominous Instrumental) 
 ♪ Wombat: Hey Marci. 
 Where's Dave? 
 I don't‐I don't know. 
 Wombat: Come here! 
 (Gasping) 
 Look, I swear that I don't know where he is. 
 He just took off‐ He just took off on his boat. 
 (Panting) 
 Wombat: Tell him the Northern Raiders are looking for him. 
 (Motorcycle Engine Revs) 
 Cardinal: All right. 
 Two victims: one dead marina owner, and one living Jane Doe. 
 Kular: Are you thinking it's one case? 
 Two completely different M. O.'s. 
 Cardinal: Dave Elhurst stole the make and model of gun that put a bullet in Red. 
 And we only found him because of her. 
 We're still working on how and when Red came to town. 
 Ah, there's no record of her coming by bus or train and there's no overdue rental cars. 
 We need to cast a wider net. 
 Gas stations between Pearson Airport and Algonquin Bay. 
 That's a huge net. 
 Mhm. 
 I'll get started. 
 Dyson: Where are we with Dave Elhurst? 
 Ah, search of his house turned up nothing. 
 Cardinal: We don't see Marci cutting him up, but we've asked her and Dave's friends to account for their whereabouts. 
 And still no sign of his boat? 
 McLeod: Not yet. 
 But Jerry Commanda offered us an OPD boat. 
 We'll cover more territory. 
 What about VICLAS? 
 McLeod: I searched bodies with missing parts, plus the pictographs. 
 No hits. 
 But when I searched just missing body parts, I found a few unsolved cases from Toronto. 
 Keep us posted. 
 That's it. 
 Let's get to work. 
 Dave's autopsy? 
 I'll stay on his financials. 
 (Phone Ringing) 
 Detective Delorme. 
 Marci? 
 Any preliminaries you can share? 
 Well, the torso's got, uh, two puncture wounds from when he was suspended in the cave. 
 Cardinal: What about these? 
 Barnhouse: Ah, they're smaller, about one inch in diameter. 
 Ah, the sharpened sticks we found at the scene. 
 Barnhouse: Very possibly. 
 Genitals were removed by a serrated blade. 
 Pre mortem. 
 Including draining the body of any blood. 
 Like you'd string up a deer? 
 Barnhouse: Ideally, the deer would be dead first. 
 But I'll leave the metaphors to the poets and detectives. 
 Cardinal: So why take the blood and the body parts? 
 ♪ Little girlie, where are you? ♪ 
 (Whistle) 
 Leon: Come on. Come on! 
 Anybody comes around here asking about a little redhead girl, you give me a call, okay? 
 Okay. ‐ Hey. 
 Just me.

 ♪ 
 ♪ Sweet bike. 
 Yeah, I found it in the woods over there. 
 Toof: Man, we hit the jackpot. 
 I mean, free food, free rent. 
 You know? 
 Ah, no thanks. 
 sh1t, I forgot. My bad. 
 Hey uh, they tell you anything else about how it's going down later? 
 Leon doesn't tell me sh1t when you're not around. 
 Yeah. He's not a big talker, huh. 
 What are you gonna do with your share? 
 Head back west. 
 Toof: What like, for like for a holiday? 
 No. 
 When I was using, I uh‐ 
 I hurt people. 
 Ray: Boys. 
 Leon's back with pizza. 
 Sweet. 
 Come on. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. ‐Hey. 
 I had a talk with Commanda's Behavioural Sciences guy and he feels we're dealing with an Afro‐Caribbean spiritual practice. 
 Voodoo or Santeria? 
 He's never seen anything like it. 
 He suggests we consult an expert in the field. 
 Hm. 
 Well, Dave Elhurst was in financial trouble. 
 Until about eight months ago. 
 And now he's in the black? 
 Mhm. 
 Suddenly flush. 
 Cash business. 
 The biker intimidating Marci at the marina: 
 Dave was laundering money for the Northern Raiders. 
 This is why NIS needs you. 
 Maybe Dave crossed paths with the bikers. 
 Stole his friend's gun and took off. 
 If the bikers killed Dave, why is one of them looking for him? 
 Could be one of them went rogue, killed him without the club's knowledge. 
 Or they're covering their tracks. 
 Maybe Dave saw something he shouldn't have. 
 Maybe Red did too. 
 Dave's crime scene doesn't feel like bikers. 
 Shot to the girl's head. 
 To me, that fits. 
 Execution‐style. 
 Maybe we're trying to draw a line where there isn't one. 
 Cardinal: Is that the biker that threatened Marci? 
 Delorme: Mhm. 
 Cardinal: (Sighs) 
 I know a guy at OPD. 
 Alan Clegg. 
 If this guy's with the Raiders, he'll know him. 
 That's Bryan Giblin. 
 Goes by "Wombat". 
 He's an enforcer for the Northern Raiders biker gang. 
 He killed those dealers in Mattawa last year. 
 What's he doing out? 
 Clegg: He never went in. 
 Scott Lasalle, who runs the Raiders, made sure that one of his low level initiates took the fall. 
 He was looking for our vic, Dave Elhurst. 
 Owns the marina. 
 We think Dave was laundering money for the Northern Raiders. 
 I've been working the Raiders for three years. 
 I never heard of the guy. 
 Well Mr. Elhurst is out of the game now. 
 Oh Christ. 
 Cardinal: Does that look like Raiders' handiwork to you? 
 Well, if he crossed Lasalle I wouldn't put it past them. 
 (Rock Music) 
 ♪ Scott Lasalle? 
 Lasalle: Yeah. 
 We're looking for a friend of yours. 
 Bryan Giblin, also known as Wombat. 
 Well I can't help you there. 
 But, um, we've got a new wheat ale on tap if you want a beer. 
 Its got a hint of honey in it. 
 He was looking for Dave Elhurst at the marina yesterday. 
 Okay. 
 Cardinal: We want to talk to Dave in connection with a shooting. 
 Delorme: But somebody got to him first. 
 Took his head. 
 And other parts. 
 Am I supposed to know this Dave guy? 
 His profits have gone way up since your club started renting boats there. 
 Happy to support the local businesses. 
 We'll need your whereabouts between May 29 and June 4. 
 Yeah, I'll get right on that. 
 If you're talk to Mr. Giblin, have him call us.
