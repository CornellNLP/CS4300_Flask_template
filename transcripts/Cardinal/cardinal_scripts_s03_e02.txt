 Narrator: Previously on Cardinal. 
 McLeod: I found a note in her bag. 
 Dyson: It's Catherine's handwriting. 
 Tawny: So this Catherine killed herself? 
 But you're not convinced. 
 Cardinal: No I am not. 
 Randall: Anyone see you? 
 Sam: No one's around anymore. 
 Can we maybe hang out for more than an hour together sometime? 
 Randall: I'm-I'm working on that. 
 Sam: Something happened at the house. 
 People came in and I heard gunshots. 
 [Screaming] [Gun Shot] 
 Randall: Did someone see you? 
 [Gun Shots] 
 Sam: Randall, we need to go to the police. 
 Randall: Don't do anything yet. 
 I'll figure something out. 
 Dyson: We have a situation on Island Road. 
 I want you to take the lead. 
 At least two people died in this house. 
 So where are the bodies? 
 Delorme: How's your sister? 
 Dyson: She's not good. 
 She's got a couple of weeks left, maybe days. 
 Cardinal: We need to concentrate the search for the bodies on the lake. 
 Delorme: So you think he dumped them in the water? 
 Cardinal: I think they're down there.

 Second shot, point blank, through the frontal bone, and exiting the parietal. 
 Fatal.

 Torres: Note this: offensive wounds on both the victim's hands. 
 He fought the killer. 
 So she could escape. 
 Torres: Victim 2. Shot in the spine, T-7, second shot, also fatal, also in the frontal bone. 
 Any ID? 
 No.

 Delorme: Her wedding band matches his. 
 They're married. 
 And rich. 
 Torres: Starting the Y incision. 
 Delorme: No wallets, no keys, no leads from the clothing labels. 
 Somebody must know who they are.

 It's gonna cost me a whole week's pay to fix it. 
 Here's your phone. 
 You know what, keep it until you find yours. 
 Bad week you're having. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks mom.

 Everything okay? 
 Fine.

 You want to have some dessert Janey? 
 Yeah. 
 Looks like there's some pie over there, why don't you have a look. 
 Okay. 
 She's sleeping better. 
 No nightmares for a week. 
 What about you? 
 I can't take a leave right now. 
 I can't do it. 
 You lost your sister and now we're raising her daughter. 
 [Sighs] 
 Your life got turned upside down. 
 They should understand that. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Foreboding Instrumental] 
 Scared Woman: There's a man with a gun in the laundromat next door. 
 I'm a police officer, tell me what happened. 
 He came in, didn't say anything. 
 Walked right past me with the gun. 
 I think he was crying. 
 Was it a rifle? 
 A handgun? 
 How many people are over there right now? 
 Um, 4 or 5. 
 I-I'm not sure. 
 I want you to stay put. 
 Close the blinds. 
 Lock the door. 
 Everybody get on the floor. 
 I don't want you answering the door for anyone unless it's the police. 
 This is Dyson. 
 I'm at the Sunshine Laundromat on Main. 
 There's an armed man. 
 I need backup.

 Said they set up their booth but they never came back. 
 Delorme: Did you find out where they were staying? 
 [Bubbling] 
 Delorme: The manager confirms the Barstows rented the big boat down there to entertain clients from the Sportsman's Show. 
 They rented it the last two years. 
 He says they're nice people, no problems. 
 Anyone on board since they disappeared? 
 Delorme: No. 
 No one else should have a key. 
 Okay. 
 Cardinal: So after the murders the killer takes the boat key and comes here looking for something. 
 Looking for what? 
 Money? 
 The show was just getting started, they wouldn't have made anything yet. 
 I have the override code. 
 Let's see. 
 4791. 
 Cardinal: 4-7-9-1. 
 [Beeping] 
 So either they never used the safe or he found out their code. 
 Hm. I'll get Ident here to see if we can match the prints from Island Road.

 What's going on? 
 Thank you. 
 I just had lunch with the Hannetts. 
 And they want me to run in the by-election. 
 You're going to run for office? 
 You don't think that I should? 
 No, no no no, it's not that I just I didn't realize you wanted to get into politics. 
 This is gonna be good for us. 
 Maybe you can take more on around here.

 He shot himself two hours ago. 
 Inside the laundromat, on Main. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks for letting me know.

 ♪ Delorme: And they never came back to their booth. 
 Natalia: I wanted to make sure they weren't stranded on the side of the highway. 
 I didn't think they were... 
 I mean, anyone would hurt them. 
 And they were friends of yours? 
 Irena was. 
 I've known her ten years. 
 If you wanted your family crest, or pink camo, Irena would make it for you. 
 And it would be a work of art. 
 She made one like this for me as a gift. 
 We got really close over the years and... 
 Uh, I-I can't do this right now. 
 Cardinal: What can you tell us about Roman? 
 Natalia: Pretty good guy. 
 I mean, even tempered, he wasn't a drunk, he didn't sleep around. 
 Had a lot of money to throw around, too. 
 He helped Irena build her business. 
 Ah, it wasn't just about the money, though. 
 Roman made Irena happy. 
 He made a lot of people happy. 
 He was kind and generous with his friends. 
 And nobody felt differently about him? 
 Or her? 
 Natalia: Well, there was Irena's ex-husband, Monty. 
 They started coming here together to sell Irena's bows, and Monty drank away all the money she'd make. 
 And where's Monty now?

 Your ex-wife, no? 
 Get it. 
 I knew if she stayed with Roman something bad would happen. 
 What makes you say that? 
 'Cuz that guy was shady as hell. 
 Shady how? 
 Irena and me started the custom bow thing. 
 Soon as it took off, Roman drove up with a truckload of cash to buy us out. 
 Guess he thought Irena was part of the deal. 
 What kind of a man takes another man's wife? 
 Lots of them. 
 Monty: You know what's sad? 
 The only reason I come to this town is to see her, once a year. 
 When did you see her this year? 
 Monty: I didn't. 
 They were no-shows at the welcome party, didn't see them at the booth. 
 Thought she was avoiding me. 
 Alibi checks out. 
 Quite a few people remember your karaoke performance from Saturday night. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You said Roman was shady. 
 Well. 
 I mean, he used to be an exec at a gun company. 
 Those guys are all criminals. 
 You think he retired at 50 on stock options alone? 
 What are you suggesting, Mr. Logan? 
 That Irena isn't dead over bad luck, some random thing. 
 She's dead because of Roman Barstow. 
 I guarantee it.
