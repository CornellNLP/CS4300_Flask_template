 Previously on  Cardinal... 
 Keith :  Just please tell me why you're doing this. 
 Edie :  You should be happy. 
 You were gonna die tonight. 
 Dorothy Pine :  That's Katie's. 
 Where did you find it? 
 Cardinal :  On Windigo island, near the mineshaft. 
 She promised things would return to normal when she's back in Financial. 
 What do you mean, when she's back in Financial? 
 Josh :  Her transfer to CIS, it's some assignment. 
 You didn't know that? Delorme :  My suspect cashed in chips four nights ago. Do you think you could Just some serial numbers. Hannam :  That's fresh money, straight from the bank. Delorme :  Why would you launder new bills? Cardinal :  My wife has bipolar disorder. It's hard for Kelly to see her like this. Delorme :  Woodrow "Woody" Baldwin. Our thief follows his targets home with their new stuff. Then he hits their house later. Untie me! Untie me! Shh-shh-shh. Edie :  ERIC! I came for the guitar. Ugh!

We just can't do it here. Why not? Because of him. If someone misses him, if someone knows where he went last night. Maybe someone saw his truck out front. Can't take that chance. What are you looking at, Keith? Where will we go? Eric :  I know a place. I do my photos there. It's safe. It's clean. No one's there. Edie :  Eric? Eric. Maybe we should just stop. Maybe we should just be done. How does that go? I mean, how-how does that go? How does that go? We just wipe the slate clean? [Eerie Music] ♪ 
♪ ♪ Eric :  Just keep your head. It's just a normal day. You go to work, get the drugs. I'll get the new place set up. We'll take Keith there tonight, after dark, okay? Delorme :  There's no excuse. But right when we decided to start trying, I got this assignment. I knew the transfer was coming. New department. New partner. It all felt like too much. So you started taking them again? I never stopped. I know it's wrong. You could have said no to the assignment. It's a delay. That's all. Just to get through this. I'm tired of being the one fighting for us, Lise. If this isn't something that you want, you need to say so. It is. [Sombre Piano Chords] ♪ Delorme :  I ran the numbers twice. The money Cardinal used to buy chips is straight from the bank. It doesn't come from Corbett. Hansen :  He's laundering his own money? Clean money? Why? Same reason you'd launder dirty money. You disrupt the connection to the source. It means he's not getting payoffs. No, it means he's paying someone, someone he doesn't want to be associated with. So he's covering his tracks. God, this is good, Delorme. This is confirmation. I don't see it. Look, Cardinal tipped off Corbett. That part we know. He got a cop killed. That's a hell of a secret. That's the kind of secret that you pay to keep quiet. Come on. What is it? I don't know. I've worked with Cardinal now. I wonder if he'd do it. You said it yourself. Would he doesn't matter. [Whispering] Because he did. You did good work, Delorme. You find out who this guy is paying off, we got him. [Suspenseful Music] ♪ 
♪ Woman :  John. Cardinal :  You know how stupid it is to come here? How'd you find my house? Followed you from the station. Yesterday. Drove all over this pretty little town. You even know how to use that thing? Don't think it's very complicated. What's this? Everything I could manage short of selling my house. Will you walk out of here with that? I never want to see you again. Didn't agree to a buy-out. Six months ago,  I caught this case. Katie Pine. A missing twelve-year-old girl. It was my job to find her. But I didn't ask the right questions, didn't look in the right corners. And the man who did that  hasn't stopped. Are you trying to put this on me? I can't do this anymore. What about the dead cop? You don't care about him anymore? More than you'll ever know. So you'll keep paying. Or I'll tell the world. Cardinal :  My partner's investigating me. If we keep this up, we'll be caught. I have no doubt. Is he any good? She is, yeah. And for a second there, I thought you were making a plea from the heart but you're just afraid of getting caught, just like everybody else. Take the money. Never come back. [Pulsing Music] ♪

♪ [Phone Ringing] Hey kiddo. What? You're here- you're here now? Well I don't understand. I thought you were... what about class? Well sure, sure. I'll-I'll-I'll come pick you up. I'll be right there. Hey. You should have told me you were coming. I'd have got you a flight. You would have said not to come. That's okay. Anyway, I like the bus. Well it's just uh, it's not a great time, Kel. I know. I saw the news. I thought you can use some company. Hey, what's a Form 1? Why do you ask? Kelly :  'Cause that's what mom is. According to the nurse who wouldn't let me speak to her, she's a Form 1. It's just, uh, it's just the way they-they keep track. Dad, I came all the way here. Form 1 means that she's a, a danger to herself and possibly to other people. So she's in the hospital involuntarily. So is it as bad as it's ever been? That's not what you said. [Phone Ringing] I want to see her. [Phone Ringing] Cardinal. White male, forties, dumped sometime last night or early this morning. Well that's way too old to be Keith London. So who is this? No ID yet, but I'm guessing it's connected to the burnt out truck my boys found off Mukwa Road. Cardinal :  Any sign of torture? Commanda :  It's hard to say yet. He's wrapped up pretty good but it does look like he was tortured. IDENT found it nearby. Our corpse has all ten of his so they're running the print. Tell me you're up for this right now, John. What's on your mind, Jer? If more had been done to stop this guy back when it was just an Indian girl, none of this would be happening. I defended you more times than you know. Even when it cost me. Said you were one of the good ones. Clean. Maybe I'm a fool. Your partner's here. Cardinal? It's our B&E suspect. It's Woody Baldwin. [Bang] [Dramatic Music] ♪ 
♪ ♪ Edie :  Dammit. [Footsteps] [Crescendoing Music] ♪ Edie, what's going on? I-I dropped my earring. Jesus. Edie :  There it is. What happened to you? Oh it's, uh, it's stupid, I tripped on the steps at my house. I, um, hit my head on the railing. You need to see a doctor. I did. He said I'm fine. You should go home. Rest. I'll get someone to cover for you. Okay. [Ethereal Music] [Lens Shutter Clicking] [Knocking] Thomas :  Hello. Here you go. I have some good news. Your daughter called. She's coming by. Kelly's here? And the doctor thinks it'll be nice for you to spend some time together. She sounds so grown up. How old is she now? Um, sixteen? Catherine. Uh, she's seventeen. Thomas :  Well, it'll be nice to see her. [Click] Cardinal :  Yeah, thanks. The finger belongs to Keith London. Make this make sense to me. Woody was on the job. He hit the wrong house. He paid with his life. This is a quick kill, hasty disposal. I think the killer was surprised and he's off plan. He'll make a mistake. Talk to Woody Baldwin's wife. I'm so sorry about last night. I don't know what Josh was thinking coming to your place. He told me he, um,  he shared some stuff. It's none of my business. You must think I am an asshole. Whatever else is going on in your life, park it. [Train Whistle] 
 
 [Car Doors Shut] Mrs. Baldwin, I'm Detective Cardinal and this is Detective Delorme. When he didn't come home, I uh, we had had a disagreement and I just thought that he was blowing off steam. Do you have any idea where he went last night? Kristin :  No, no. Mrs. Baldwin, we think your husband was working last night, that he was robbing houses. I don't know, I just- Mrs. Baldwin. We need to find who did this. I begged him to stop. I-I did, I just- We think it's possible that your husband broke into that person's house. He checked things online. He researched them to see what they were worth. Delorme :  Okay, here we are. Yesterday's history. A whole bunch of searches for Ovation, Keith's guitar. Okay, so he spots Keith with the guitar or spots the killer himself who's taken the guitar from Keith. Follows him home. We know Woody found his targets at the mall. Why does the killer take the guitar to the mall? Try to resell it? Get it appraised? There's a music store at the South Ridge Mall. [Knocking] Catherine? You have a special visitor. Catherine? [Knocking] Kelly :  Maybe she's in the common room? No, I was just there. Catherine, are you in there? [Sighs] What? What is it? Her coat and boots are gone. Hi. Can I help you? Hi. I'm Detective Delorme. Detective Cardinal. We need to know if a customer brought in an Ovation guitar last night,  maybe to sell or repair. No. Well, not a customer. Well you've seen one? Store Clerk :  Yeah. One of my staff just bought one, brought it in to restring it. Why? What's up? An employee? What's his name? Eric. Fraser. Ah, the guitar's hot, isn't it? Is, uh, Eric here? Store Clerk :  No. Not till tomorrow. Look, I'm gonna need you to call him and tell him he has to come in to, to fill in for someone. Store Clerk :  I can't. He doesn't believe in cell phones. Some kinda, I don't know, philosophical objection. We'll need his address. Yeah. Sure. Give me a sec. Look, I'm gonna post someone here. If Eric happens to come before the officer arrives, I want you not to tell him we were here. Do you understand? You just step away and call me. All right. I'll get a patrol here. Call Flower, see what CPIC has on Fraser. What? [Suspenseful Music] ♪ Katie Pine was here. We got him. Good afternoon. We begin this hour with breaking news. Algonquin Bay Police are investigating a suspicious death following the discovery of a man's body this morning. The man was found in the woods near Hartley Road around 9 am and was pronounced dead at the scene. The victim's identity is being withheld but an ABPD spokesman described him as known to police. How could this happen? Thomas :  Don't worry, okay? We're gonna find her. Hey. I checked around the building. She's not on the grounds. Your mom's been doing really well. She'll be okay. Yeah, well, she couldn't have gone far but I'll drive around, take a look around. I'm coming with you. Delorme :  Eric Fraser, two charges of mischief, one in Sault Ste. Marie, and one in Markham and two years ago a theft charge, Markham again. It got him ninety days in Algoma. Cardinal :  Family? None listed. You've done this before? Lots of times. At the range. Super :  Yeah, saw him come in earlier. Why? Is he in, uh, is he in some kind of trouble? He's right up there. Number four. The doorbell doesn't work. Okay. [Knocking] Mr. Fraser? [Knocking] Mr. Fraser! [Pulsing Music] ♪ No? No. It's too small. There's not enough space. No, and too public. Up and down those stairs with his victims. No. He must have another space. Get a BOLO out. Yeah. [Phone Ringing] Edie :  Hello? Eric :  Is the basement clean? Edie :  Yeah. Eric :  You flushed the drains? You did everything I said? Yeah. I did. Eric :  Listen to me. What's wrong? Eric :  You need to get Keith out of your house. What? Eric :  They found the thief's body. How? Eric :  I don't know. But it could lead the police to your place. Edie. Edie. It doesn't matter because they won't find anything because you're gonna get him out of there. I can't. I can't lift him. I'm twenty minutes away from your place. This has to happen now. You can do it. I believe in you. [Airy Music] ♪ You can't blame yourself for this. I stress her out. Hey, everyone stresses out their mom. I know I do. Does your mom run off into the snow? Sorry. It's just... everyone thinks that they have advice. Fraser drives a red van. BOLO's gone out with the tags. Do you want an IDENT team here? Cardinal :  Yeah. Why don't we park the whole circus out front so he can see us from blocks away? Any other bright ideas? Hey. I'm just as frustrated as you are. Somehow I doubt it. Delorme :  Is there something on your mind? Yeah. That kid out there who's probably already dead and I'm gonna carry that around for the rest of my days. Are you? Or are you moving on? What is this, a pain contest? Because I concede. You are an asshole, to answer your question. You don't back into this job, Delorme. You don't half ass it  until something better comes along. Maybe that worked in Financial. Maybe it works at home. But not here. Because your focus is one hundred percent. Whatever you think you're looking for, there's nothing to find. Where are you going? Cardinal :  To call Eric Fraser's Parole Officer. (Mumbling) [Grunting] [Grunting] [Heavy Breathing] [Eerie Music] ♪ 
♪ [Heart Beating] Cardinal :  All right, you got it. What's this? One batch labelled "October". That's Katie Pine. One labelled "January". Todd Curry. Nothing for this month. No Keith. He hasn't finished with him yet. And they're all close-ups. Could be taken anywhere. Yeah, but where does he process them? He needs space, power, water. Not some hole in the ground. What? Parole Officer said he worked at the music store for the last eight months and before that as a night guard at Holder Security. That's the same company as Maureen LaBelle. That's where he spotted Billy LaBelle. And he'd have access to properties, empty buildings, warehouses. Delorme :  So we need a vacant space  that was under contract to Holder Security while Eric was working for them. There can't be that many. [Whimpering] Keith :  Please make it stop. Please. I'm scared. [Whimpering] ♪ There. Stop. That's her. ♪ Kelly :  Mom? Catherine :  Honey? What are you doing here? Mom, you scared me. Catherine :  I just... I wanted to clear my head. I couldn't talk myself into going back. Your hands must be freezing. Restraints. From when they brought me in. You shouldn't have to see me like this. How's the ice this year? It was late. Fishing huts didn't go out till the end of January. It looks solid now. He's here. Dispatch, this is DC Delorme. We need all available units to the Brandell School on Kildare Avenue. Armed subject, possible hostage. We need full ERT. [Dispatch Radio Chatter] [Dramatic Music] ♪
