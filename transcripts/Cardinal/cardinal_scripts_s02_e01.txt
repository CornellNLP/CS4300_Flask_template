 I was on a date. 
 Ah. 
 Sorry. 
 He spent the whole time explaining how prosecution works. 
 He was probably nervous. 
 These are detectives Cardinal and Delorme from the Algonquin Bay Police Department. 
 They'll be taking over the case from here. 
 ER Doctor: Okay, well, the bullet entered the victim's left temporal lobe. 
 Lodged near the hippocampus. 
 So lobotomy by gunshot. 
 That would explain her placid mood. 
 What's her condition? 
 The bullet's close to a cerebral artery. 
 Based on her EEG‐ one or two strong seizures and she's dead. 
 They're assembling a trauma team in Toronto. 
 Can we see her? ‐ Mmm hmm. 
 Cardinal: Thanks. ‐Thanks. 
 Commanda: All right, thank you. 
 So, I've been calling her "Red" because I don't think that Jane Doe is appropriate for a living victim. 
 Is she local? 
 Nobody recognized her in the bar and I ran her picture against our missing persons and no hits. 
 No, ah, cell phone? Purse? 
 Just the clothes on her back and judging by the leaves and the dirt and everything, she had to be out in the bush for a while before she went into the bar. 
 Huh. 
 Cardinal: Hi. 
 I'm Detective Cardinal. 
 This is Detective Delorme. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Great. 
 How are you? 
 Cardinal: Um‐ There's a helicopter that's going to take you to a hospital in Toronto. 
 Why? 
 I feel fine. 
 Ah‐ Well, because you have a bullet lodged in your brain and the doctors want to take it out. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. 
 Ah, can you help us with something. 
 We'd like to go through your clothing, see if there's any identification. 
 Red: Sure. 
 Ah, do you mind if I take your photo? 
 Is my hair crazy? 
 No. 
 Do you have any idea who might have done this to you? 
 Done what?

 Plain, unjacketed, lead, thirty‐two caliber bullet. 
 And it looks to me like a thirty‐two long. 
 See normally with a head shot, you'd expect the bullet to mushroom and look here, it's almost intact. 
 Now old or waterlogged maybe. 
 That's why it didn't kill her. 
 Six right‐hand grooves, with a land groove ratio of one‐to‐one‐plus. 
 Grooves are zero point five‐six; lands are zero point six‐oh. 
 Pistol. 
 The rifling on the weapon has a left‐hand twist. 
 That narrows it down to two possibilities: a J. C. Higgins model 80, or a Colt Police Positive. 
 That helps. 
 There are hundreds of these in Ontario.

 You picked her up southbound Highway 11? 
 Yeah. 
 She was wandering.

 She didn't flag you for a ride? 
 You saw her and you pulled over. 
 Truck Driver: I don't usually pick up hitchhikers. 
 But she caught your eye. 
 I have three daughters. 
 I'd like to think that if one of them was lost out there‐ Delorme: What made you think she was lost? 
 Truck Driver: She didn't know her name. 
 Didn't know where she'd been, where she was going. 
 So you dropped her off at a roadside bar. 
 Instead of here or the hospital. 
 She saw the World Tavern, said to drop her off there. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 Keep her prisoner in my cab? 
 So you were worried enough to pick her up, but not enough to take her somewhere safe? 
 It's not‐ I started thinking it was a scam. 
 Ah, maybe I do want to call a lawyer. 
 Is she a lumberjack? 
 Okay, how old is she? 
 Twenties. Five four, a hundred and twenty pounds.

 Forensics is going through the truck. 
 Nothing yet. 
 And his story checks out. 
 I don't think he's our guy. 
 I sent you Venn's, uh, preliminary firearms report. Have you‐ Delorme: Yeah, I pulled a list of registered owners matching the two gun types. 
 We've got six in town. 
 I thought I'd start with these before working my way further out. 
 How's Red? 
 Ah, she forgets who I am every time I leave the room.

 Stole his buddy's gun, took off on his boat after he shot her? 
 Not impossible.

 She might "remember" this is the man who shot her, even if he isn't. 
 Someone out there tried to kill her. 
 And the sooner she remembers who she is‐ She hasn't forgotten who she is. 
 She just can't retrieve the information right now.

 Tomorrow I'm going to introduce various stimuli music, images, smells‐ Okay. So just add this picture to the other ones. 
 One of many, it's not suggestive. 
 You seen anyone outside this door?
