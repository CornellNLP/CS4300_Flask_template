 Previously on Cardinal...  
 Coroner Len Torres :  Some of this was frenzy violence but some of it was purposeful. 
 He was experimenting. 
 Audio tape. 
 Delorme :  If you were taking off for good, you'd bring your laptop. 
 I'm telling you this kid didn't run away. 
 He went to do something. Cardinal :  Or meet someone. My wife has bipolar disorder. I'm sorry. I had no idea that... Yeah, why did my mom bring us a teddy bear? Josh :  I might have let it slip, we're trying. This isn't your thing, Josh. You don't make the decisions on your own. Musgrave :  Find the link between Cardinal and Corbett. Cardinal :  What happened to your truck? Francis :  I hit a squirrel. Why so much this time? Delorme :  He buys black market chips, cashes them in. It shows how Cardinal launders his rat money. Cardinal :  He won't stop, not until we stop him. Nothing else matters. Could you walk me home? Eric :  We can still drive away. We're doing this. ["Familiar" -Agnes Obel] ♪

Bend your knees. Keep loose. I am. [Bang] You're still looking at the bottles. Just look at the sight. Focus on the sight. [Bang] He's thinking, "I'm a guy in love so I better act like a guy in love." And guys in love ask questions about what's within". [Bang] It's just all a big show. What does she say back? A picture of a heart. Edie :  He's making an effort. I think it's sweet. [Tinkling & clicking] Edie :  Are you sending that to her? Eric :  Huh? Eric, why would you do that? I don't know, sometimes I surprise myself. [Train whistle] [Clanging] All right. Time to go. [Bang] [Clanging] Woman's Voice on TV :  One moment of peace you have with her. She said, "I was never in peace. I hated". She said, "I was driven by hate". Edie :  Gran? TV Program :  Not towards you but towards other people. Edie :  Gran? Television Program :  Yeh... That's why she silenced you. That's why she-she was like- If you're sleeping let's turn this off. Television Program :  She too had been through abuse. Did you go to Pozzies? Edie :  Eric and I had something to do. Uh, is he here? Hello, you old yam. Gran :  Oh, he should pay rent, he's here so much. God, you smell disgusting. I made a list. [Cough] Sooner rather than later, Edie, huh? [Pulsing music] ♪ [Creaking & footsteps] ♪ [Lock clicking] [Ominous music] ♪ Keith? Wake up, Keith. He's still out. Delorme :  What time did you get home? [Groans] Maybe midnight. I didn't want to wake you. Hm. Everybody was asking about you. I thought you were gonna join us. I was beat. Hey, are you smoking again? No, why? Uh, I just thought I smelled it in the car. I shouldn't have told your mom that we're trying to have a baby. I'm sorry. It's okay. [Rhythmic music] ♪ 
♪ [Snoring] Cardinal :  The techs have uncovered  an encrypted e-mail exchange on Todd Curry's computer,  something either Curry or the person Curry was communicating with didn't want seen. They're working to crack it. So, did Curry meet the killer online? Let's be open to that idea. We do know he photographed Katie Pine. We can hear it on the audiotape. So, does he share them? Does he post them? CES is scouring the internet but, if you hear of Cell phone trace? Sarge? A couple of days after Curry arrived here he travelled due south about eighty Kilometres  and spent several hours just outside of Dorset. McLeod, I want you down there to have a look around. Hannam, the seeing impaired traffic signals are mapped. You'll run that canvass. Take ah, Fox and Leddy with ya, knock on every door. Any questions? Good. Go. So am I with you today? Oh, one last thing. Ah, tips are coming in from the public by the truckload. Anything comes your way,  pass it along to Detective Delorme. I want a written tip sheet on every one. Yes sir. Dyson :  Does he know? Yesterday he was your biggest fan, today he's burying you in sups. Is that so you don't have enough time to follow your own investigation? Can I run something by you? I was going over the dates and... Yep. Hello? Hello? Uh, the dates. Yeah. Billy LaBelle to Katie Pine was five months. Katie Pine to Todd Curry, three months. Todd Curry to now... The answer is yes. He might have already struck again. [Creaking] [Eerie music] ♪ Edie :  Maybe I gave him too much. I know how we can wake him. Should I? The thing about the pinky is that there's a nerve that runs all the way up the arm. It's called the ulnar nerve. If I cut it, he'll jolt up like he's on fire. What do you say? Edie, talk. I have to go to work. [Sighs] [Scraping] Edie :  I thought we were waiting. I thought that's what you wanted. Eric :  So you just stand there like a dumb animal? I thought we were waiting. Go to work. Eric. It's not enough, you know, to get a little thrill out of this? A little tingle in your loins. 'Cause guess what? Anybody does. You put this in front of anybody and they'll watch. So don't think that makes you special. Why are you being like this? Because. Ha... Because... it's not enough  to be a spectator. It's boring. I thought you were more. I am. Go to work. [Eerie music] ♪ Detective Hannam :  Know where you're going? Okay so just get 'em talking, see how they feel about having a cop at their door. Anyone seem especially nervous, make a note. Too confident, make a note. [Seeing impaired traffic signal beeping] Hannam :  Questions? No. Hannam :  Report back to me. Move out. [Phone ringing] Cardinal. Mcleod :  Hey, John,  that location where Todd Curry travelled, there's nothing here. What do you mean nothing? Describe it to me. Mcleod :  I'm telling ya, road, lake, trees, pipe,  railroad tracks and power lines to the west. He spent five hours there. There has to be something. A shed? Something. Mcleod :  Maybe he was hitchhiking. Got this far, ran out of luck so he headed back to town. All right. Uh, you went all that way, just do me a favour and dig around a bit, will ya? Will do. And I'm done. [Ethereal music] ♪ Cardinal :  You recognize this. It was Katie's. Where did you find it? Cardinal :  On Windigo Island, near the mineshaft. Dorothy :  Is that helpful? Cardinal :  Sometimes a predator will use gifts to lure a victim. If that were the case, then this might point us in his direction. No. It was Katie's. She bought it over a year ago. That boy they found,  was he killed by the same man? We have reason to believe so, yes. Katie have a... an online friend? Someone she might have  met on the Internet? You checked her computer. Maybe she used one at school? Like a secret friend? I knew her friends. She would have told me. So, the killer maybe used a bracelet. Or maybe a computer. Or maybe none of those things? We are making progress, Dorothy. So is he. [Eerie music & guitar strumming] ♪ Eric :  My goodness. It lives. [Chuckling] Hey. I'm so sorry about last night. That's on me. I'm sorry. I get a little... chippy when I drink. No hard feelings? [Deep breathing] Where am I? You're at Edie's house. [Sighs] You remember Edie, with the face? [Sighs] You must have had a few too many because you got pretty sick. They were gonna bounce you to the curb, so we brought you here. [Sighs] What time is it? It's, um, eczema by the way. Uh, you were too polite to ask, but I'm pretty sure that you were wondering. Where are my clothes? Eric :  Uh, you puked all over them so I put them in the wash. I should probably make a call. Do you know where my phone is? Uh, no sorry, I didn't find a phone, but you can use the one upstairs if you want. Keith :  Ugh. Eric :  Ah. Yeah. You're probably pretty dehydrated. You puked up a lot of fluids. Here. Take your time. There you go. I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall. It's old school. Is it, uh, Claire you wanted to speak to? Girlfriend? Did I tell you about her? You told me a lot of things. [Deep breathing] Eric :  Oh. Oh. Looks like we're gonna lose you again. Wait, before you go, I do want to show you something. [Scraping] Hey. A little preparation in this area saves everyone a lot of trouble. I learnt that the hard way. Do you know what this is? It's for you, Keith. So you don't make a mess. [Solemn music] ♪ 
♪ [Elevator music] ♪ [Background chatter] It's twenty past, Margo. I know. I'm sorry. My ride fell through. Happens way too much. Last time. Promise. Thanks a lot for punching me in. You didn't ask. I asked last week. Consider it a standing request, Edie. I'll do the same for you. I'm never late. Well, that is part of a larger conversation. Do you have any gum? You work a s**t job,  All you ever do is, do what you're told. Time to reassess, son. Do you want one? No thanks. It looks really red today. Does it hurt? It's just the cold. Yes, but let me just back up, Mrs. Talbot. So you're a hundred percent sure that what your neighbour was carrying was a machete. Yes, but you could tell from that distance? Yes. Okay. Well, I have your number so I'll call you if we need to follow up. Thank you. So? What do the good people of Algonquin Bay have to say? Not all tips are useless. Some are useless and racist. I thought you were number two on this. I'm paying my dues. Well, don't take it personally. We're lucky to have a Toronto UC big shot showing us how it's done. Cardinal worked UC? I didn't see that in his history. Uh, deep cover. I mean, the kind of stuff that doesn't end up on your CV. 
 
 Hey, Paul, it's Lise, how are you? Good. Uh, listen, my new Sergeant's got me organizing a roast for this uh, detective who's coming up on twenty years. I want to track down his old partners but his case history seems to be buried. You think you could get that for me? Great. Yeah, his name is John Cardinal. [Eerie music] ♪ Hello beautiful. I saw Kelly. She sends her love. Oh. Hey, listen, what do you need these days to  process 35 mil film? To do it all yourself? Yeah. Say you're taking pictures that are private. Well, you need some space, for starters. For a darkroom. I haven't done it in years. Chemicals, papers, trays. Huh. Who carries that stuff? Are you working right now? It could help me. [Chuckles] I'm tired. [Solemn piano chords] ♪ [Lens shutter clicking] [Groans] Eric :  Keith. Keith. [Grunting] It's a long exposure, if you move it's gonna be blurry. [Deep breathing] Oh, Jesus. [Grunting] Eric :  Not that I want you to be still, I just want you to do what's natural. [Grunting] Okay. Look. [Heavy breathing] What did you say your name was? I didn't say. [Heavy breathing] Okay. Okay, I don't know if you got the wrong impression, but this is not my sort of thing. Oh no? [Deep breathing] I don't know if I did something to piss you off. Like what? [Crying] I don't know if I said something. If we got into it. Eric :  Does this feel like a spat to you? Is this how spats are settled in your house? I just don't know what you want from me. [LenssShutter click] Hey, hey. You might. Look at me. Look at me. Hey, hey, shh, shh. You might know. If you're honest with yourself, Ah! [Heavy breathing] [Lens shutter click] [Knocking] Man :  Hello! Anybody home? [Suspenseful music] ♪ Fox :  Hi, ma'am. I'm Constable Fox. How are ya this afternoon? What's this about? Well, we're just out canvassing the area, [Muffled] making sure everybody's feeling safe with everything going on in the news these days. Down here! Down here! Your husband uh... Gran :  My husband? What? Is your husband here? My husband is dead. [Gasping] I will slice you wide open. Fox :  Just you then, in the house? Oh, with my granddaughter. Fox :  Oh, okay. Oh, she's not in trouble? [Grunts] Shh. What is it you want? Ah, thanks for your time, ma'am. Sorry to bother you. Please. Please. Hey, you're wasting your energy. [Whimpering] It's out of my hands. [Grunting] Eric :  This is Edie's show now. I know she doesn't look like much, but she's ready. You'll see. She just needs a little nudge. [Creaking] [Whimpering] [Tinkling] [Airy music] ♪ Tim :  See that? Do you see the impact? The whole side there is caved in. Direct hit. That's a sturdy animal. Would have blown their airbags for sure. Then off they went. Didn't call it in. Just let her die in the cold. I'll look into it. [Pulsing music] ♪ 
♪ _ Musgrave :  What the hell are you doing here? Delorme :  A raid on Corbett's operation. An officer died. You and Cardinal worked it. Look, what am I missing here? I can't do my job if you keep me in the dark. Musgrave :  The raid went bad  because of Cardinal. How? Corbett was setting up a new supply line in Toronto. My team covered this side. Cardinal was part of a crew down there, undercover. We worked it for months. Set up a sting based on what Cardinal was feeding us. We were gonna get Corbett,  his new supplier, a big shipment, all in one go. Cardinal's intel was bad? Yeah. I guess you could say that. When we arrived, no Corbett, no drugs, nothing, except a half pound of C-4 rigged to a wire. Officer's name was Julian Burwell, 27 years old. He died instantly. So Cardinal got burned. Musgrave :  No. It happens. No. He warned them we were coming. Cardinal was using disposable phones. We couldn't get the wires up fast enough so he was You know him now, you know how thorough he is, he had a file for every call, except one. Day before the raid he talks to his inside guy for six minutes. Phone records show it. There's no tape of the call. He tipped them off, Delorme, and he erased the evidence. And what did SIU say? Musgrave :  Oh, Cardinal said the recorder malfunctioned. They couldn't prove otherwise so they dropped it. He was living a double life, Delorme. Sick wife at home, kid at a fancy school, bills piling up, okay? He lost his way. He took a payoff. [Suspenseful music] ♪ You're not authorized to go after him. I have broad discretion. Yeah, to get Corbett. Cardinal was cleared. He did it. No, he was cleared. He did it. You can't just re-open it. Not without cause. Then find me some. That's why there is no paper on this. It's not even supposed to be happening. Musgrave :  Well I was told you had good instincts. It's why I brought you on. If you think Cardinal is clean then you should just  walk away. Go back to financial. No hard feelings, I promise. But I am telling you, he is in the middle of all this and I think you know it. [Haunting instrumental] ♪ 
♪ [Door closes] Francis Kestejoo? Aw, come on, man. Where you gonna run to? [Thump] Idiot. [Soft grunting] Ugh. What's the story here, Francis? None of your business. I'm unconvinced. Margo :  An SLR and a guitar. You're like, the coolest guy from 1993. Eric :  I think the '90s are a really underrated decade. The last analogue era. Margo :  So do you play that thing or is it just a prop? [Laughs] Eric :  That's a mean question. Margo :  Oh, so you don't play. [Chuckles] Eric :  I didn't say that. I'm all right but uh, this is my instrument. I play people. You really didn't just say that. I did. I capture people at their most honest. That's rare today. Don't you think? People living in the moment, being raw, not performing. I capture that. Margo :  So is this the part when you ask to take pictures of me? Would you like that? You work at the music store, right? You should come by sometime and bring your pictures. I'll take a look. Never mind. You wouldn't like them. [Clacking] I wasn't freezing you out today, Delorme. If this case breaks, it'll be something out of left field, some fragment that tumbles off the pile. That first wave of tips is key. Yeah, well, nothing came of it. Maybe not. But because it's you, I didn't have to double-check. Hannam :  Detectives, uh, I just got a call from Major Crimes in Toronto. Melissa and Douglas London. Their son, Keith, was supposed to arrive home last night, never turned up. Coming from here? Hannam :  No. Uh, well, yeah, he passed through but,  he's not here now. Cardinal :  He passed through? Coming from out west. Ah, they ran his cell. He got here last night, left this morning and he went east to a spot outside Deux Rivières,  then his signal died and nothing since. Who did you talk to in Toronto? Get them back on the line. McLeod,  that place Curry went, there were train tracks, right? Yeah, there's a little spur line there off the 11. Lise. Lise. Delorme :  Yeah? Cardinal :  Curry's phone went out in the middle of nowhere and there it sat  for five hours until it died. Keith London's phone went east also along the rail line  until it died. But then Curry turns up back here. No, he never left. His phone did. The killer puts phones on trains to throw us off. [Muted clanging] He has his next victim. ♪ [Unlocking] [Panting] [Creaking] [Muffled garbling] Edie :  Be quiet. [Muffled garbling] Be quiet! [Panting] [Deep breathing] Thank you. [Deep breathing] It's Edie, right? [Deep breathing] Why am I here? Bad luck. The cops were here before, at the door. Your friend heard them too. How? I don't know. But they were here. That means they're watching. They'll be back. Look, you can let me go, okay? We can put all of this behind us. You think I'm stupid? No. But sometimes people get into things and they don't know how to get out. Is he making you do this? 'Cause if he is, it's not your fault. You'll be forgiven. [Panting] Edie :  All you had to do  was walk me home. None of this would be happening. Keith :  Please. Please. Please, Edie, please. I can't help you. [Panting] I'm gonna make you some food. You have to eat. House rules. [Panting] [Clicking] John? Todd Curry's e-mail. We got it. IP says west side. Warrant's in process for the address. She's 19. First correspondence, was this summer and last correspondence was January 6th. Hm. Three days before he was killed. Too many I's. Too many me's. What? In Financial, we see honey trap fraud like this all the time. Guys pretending to be girls. Should I run a gender analysis? So the program is looking for certain words, punctuation styles. And, how long does this take? Delorme :  Sometimes upwards of five seconds. It's a guy. Todd Curry was corresponding with a guy. Hannam :  Sarge? Got the address. 42 Copeland Drive. Okay. Go. [Tinkling] [Grunting] [Clock ticking] Cardinal :  He's smart. The guy is smart. He knew if he kept hunting locally we'd spot his pattern. Delorme :  So he starts picking guys from out of town. First Todd Curry, now Keith London. [Creaking] [Grunting] [Bang] [Suspenseful music] ♪ 
♪ [Heavy breathing] [Dramatic music] ♪ [Banging] [Banging] [Suspenseful music] ♪ Yes? Ugh! Edie :  Idiot! [Spits] [Spits] [Moaning] Cardinal :  He's not our guy. Dyson :  You're absolutely sure? Yeah, he pretends to be a woman online, strikes up relationships with young men. Delorme :  And this one blew up on him when Curry came to meet in person. Dyson :  And he went. What was he expecting? They had been chatting for months. He'd convinced himself that Curry knew that they were role-playing together. Delorme :  Yeah, imagine Curry's reaction. Expects a 19-year-old girl. Finds that guy instead. Dyson :  Well maybe he went after Curry out of shame or fear that he might be exposed. Cardinal :  No. He and his wife left for Bangor, Maine, the next day. He wasn't here when Curry died. Dyson :  So this is the guy who lured him to town, but not the one who killed him. Cardinal :  Looks like it. [Eerie music] ♪ 
♪ [Guitar chords strumming] Eric :  You know not to come here. I have to talk to you. Eric :  We shouldn't be seen together. Are you embarrassed by me? No. Edie. No. We just have to be cautious, okay? Now, come on, let's go. [Creepy music] ♪ I made him bleed. For you.
