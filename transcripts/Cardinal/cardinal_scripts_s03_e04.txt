 Narrator: Previously on "Cardinal". 
 Cardinal: What kind of person writes and sends that kind of card? 
 Someone who's suffered. 
 You're a police officer, you must have your share of enemies? 
 Did you send the cards. 
 Man, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You cannot open up an investigation all by yourself. 
 Delorme: You're not gonna let it go. 
 If you're gonna do it, do it quieter. 
 Nathan: What the- [thud and groan] 
 So why aren't you with Nathan? 
 Marcus: I want to be able to look my son in the eyes and tell him someone paid for what they did. 
 Nikki: You doing more ATMs today? 
 Mama told me to lay off. 
 She seemed mad. 
 Jack must have done something messed up. 
 Nikki: The kid's not wired right. 
 You gotta be careful Leems, he'll hurt you. 
 Lloyd Kreeger. 
 Where's Henry? 
 Mama: He left.

 Jack: Sam Duchene.

 Sam: Please, leave me alone.

 ♪ Wendy: He called her again. 
 This man has her cell phone. 
 Sam: I must have dropped it when I jumped. 
 He's been following me. 
 That's him. 
 You drew this? 
 Wendy: She's an illustrator. 
 Goes to college for it. 
 But you said you- you didn't get a good look at him. 
 It was dark, he was wearing a hoodie. 
 I saw his face at school. 
 He was wearing the same thing. 
 Delorme: This is good. 
 We can circulate it. 
 Hey Sam, are you okay? 
 I just feel so stupid. 
 It's Randall Wishart who should feel stupid. 
 If this man can find her at school, he can find her at home. 
 We're arranging a safehouse. 
 Until then you can stay with me. 
 Commanda: Need to do a little bit of a purge. 
 Yeah, no kidding. 
 Wendy: A married man. 
 Sam, honestly, what were you thinking? 
 He said he loved me. 
 A man like that only loves himself.

 Lemur: Headshot, nice. 
 It gets easier. 
 I doubt it. 
 You did good. 
 Mama will be proud of you. 
 Lemur. 
 No. 
 We're family. 
 Lemur: I mean, not really. 
 It'll be okay so long as they don't know. 
 I don't want to. 
 It's not like you haven't done it before. 
 Just no, okay? 
 [dramatic instrumental] 
 ♪ Cardinal: So where are we with the Barstows' missing rental car? 
 McLeod: We got units patrolling but nothing yet. 
 Delorme: Dyson, can we get more units on that? 
 Sergeant? 
 Yeah, you'll have them. 
 We found something new. 
 Sawdust on Irena Barstow's pants does not match construction lumber used for dock repairs at the marina. 
 It's white pine, they're using fir. 
 McLeod: I know a cabinet guy in town that works with white pine. 
 Well done, McLeod. 
 Cabinet maker did it, we can all go home. 
 The, uh, the cabinet maker's brother he owns this dive bar where they spread sawdust on the floor. 
 [rock music] 
 McLeod: Anyone want to know where it is? 
 [rock music] 
 Alanna: Heard of it on the radio, but never seen the pictures before. 
 Cardinal: So you have seen them? 
 Alanna: I think so. 
 Were they dressed rich like this? 
 Yes, they were well dressed. 
 Expensive jewellery. 
 That's what I remember, more than the faces. 
 They stuck out. 
 Did they say anything to you? 
 Just ordered. 
 G&T's maybe? 
 They were nice, tipped well. Man: Alana, two draft. 
 Oh, they were with another guy. 
 Hm. 
 This guy? 
 Alanna: Uh, no. 
 The guy they were with was older. 
 Um... -Hey. 
 I'll get it. 
 Oh, he was, like sorta mean looking, 
 with a neck tattoo. 
 He was pretty much my type. 
 Uh, they weren't here just here to drink. 
 Seemed like they had business or something. 
 The scary one showed up with a bag. 
 Who left with the bag? 
 I don't know. 
 But the guy, he came back the next day. [buzzing] 
 He sat at the bar all afternoon nursing a beer and checking his phone like he was waiting for a call. 
 Where is it? 
 [suspenseful instrumental] 
 Harris: This is definitely the Barstow's rental car. 
 Anything on the GPS? 
 Harris: Track log was erased. 
 Can you recover the data? 
 Possibly. 
 Delorme: Okay, so he left it here after dropping them in the water. 
 Harris: Same deal as Island Road, lots of material left behind. 
 Looks like blood here on the seat and the steering wheel. 
 Days old at least, so possibly the victims'. 
 And take a look at this. 
 It was under the spare tire. 
 [crescendoing suspenseful music] 
 ♪ Cardinal: The guy the Barstows were talking to he's not a local. 
 You know all the neck tats in town? 
 You stay here long enough, you'll know 'em too. 
 Well I'm not going anywhere. 
 Maybe you should have. 
 What about the assault rifle in the trunk? 
 Cardinal: Everybody keeps telling us what nice people, good people the Barstows were. 
 Yup. He's an ex-gun industry guy. 
 And the weapon is black market. 
 And they're here for the Sportsman's Show. -Mhm. 
 It's a good cover. 
 Big bag of money in the trunk. 
 The Barstows are gun runners.

 Seriously? 
 Up north people are gonna come at us with knives? 
 Mama says we don't know what can happen, ever. 
 We need to be prepared for anything. 
 Like that punk that talked back at the ATM? 
 I just put him down. 
 No hesitation. 
 Jack: Hey, can I play? 
 We-we were just finishing up. 
 No, come on man, let me show you something. 
 I got something new, huh?

 Jack: See how easy that was? 
 Lemur: I'm okay. Nikki:Let him go. 
 Lemur: I'm okay. 
 Jack: See? See how I'm holding him? 
 You can kill a man this way. 
 Secret is, you gotta hold him long enough. 
 Not just till he goes limp. 
 Longer. 
 Lemur: You learn this from Mama? 
 No. 
 My dad used to choke me out whenever I talked back to him. 
 Party trick for his buddies.

 Lemur: You wanna tell her about the girl from Colorado? 
 Yeah, he wanted her to come with us. 
 But she didn't want to. 
 Didn't turn out good for her, did it? 
 You gonna do the same thing with the girl that drew that picture you've been carrying around? 
 You see, Mama and I, we could replace you. 
 Both of you could disappear and no one would even know you were gone.

 Cardinal: What about him? 
 Uni spotted the guy on Fraser, tried to grill him about the Barstows. 
 Wasn't cooperating so the poor kid tried to strong-arm him. 
 Uh, didn't turn out too well for either one of them. 
 Where is he now? 
 McLeod: Uh, kid's getting stitches but your guy's in holding. 
 Misha Pulaski, you're gonna love him. 
 Delorme: We have a witness who saw you with the Barstows at the bar. 
 You had a bag. 
 Same bag was found in their abandoned rental car. 
 Along with their blood. 
 The last and only time I saw those folks was at the Chinook. 
 Cardinal: Where you were buying guns. 
 Okay, we know you were with them and we know what they do. 
 Good, so you know they were not here to sell pretty bows and arrows, hm? 
 How long have they been coming here to sell illegal weapons? 
 I couldn't tell you. 
 Okay. So you just decided to give them a bag with fifty thousand dollars? 
 Sure. Down payment on some hunting bows for Christmas. 
 You know, my sisters, they love those Hunger Games. 
 Listen to me. 
 You assaulted a police officer, that's not going away. 
 Now, we can't charge you for a gun deal that never happened, but we can focus on you as a murder suspect. 
 Look. You think if I knew where those guns were, I would still be here? Hm? 
 Then tell us this- how many guns do you think the Barstows brought here to sell. 
 Oh, even if I had to guess? 
 Oh, they brought enough to fight an army.

 If you could have one cool thing to bring up north with you, what would it be? 
 A new pair of True Religion jeans. 
 Super skinny, indigo dark. 
 I'm gonna get you a pair. 
 No way. 
 We gotta lay low, Leems. 
 We can't roll up to the mall and knock off a jean store. 
 It's not the jeans I'm stealing. 
 Your kill? Mhm. 
 Nice. 
 What happened to your face? 
 You do this to your sister? -No, he didn't. 
 Then what happened? 
 You want to learn how to field dress a rabbit Nikki? 
 I've had enough blood for one day.
