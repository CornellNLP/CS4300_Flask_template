 - HOMELANDER:  Freedom... 
- [GROANS]   
 ...comes at a price.   
 - So, I'm down a point? 
- ASHLEY:  Nine and a half.   
 STORMFRONT:  Bad day?   
 - Goddamn it. 
- Hey, I'm with you.   
 But you know, there's a way to handle it.   
 I owe you.   
 [MOANS]    
 Thanks to the Church of the Collective,    
 I now know the kind of man I want to be.   
 - #BraveMaeve. 
- MAEVE:  This is Homelander.   
 He's f*cking with me. I can't protect you  if you leave.    
 What are we gonna do?    
 CHERIE:  You think, by saving Kimiko,   
 you can make amends   
 for those children   
 - that Lamplighter burned. 
- FRENCHIE: f*ck you.    
 HUGHIE:  You can't go through this   
 - on your own. 
- We're all alone.    
 How do you think the world will feel when I tell them that you used to be Liberty?    
 Wow.

 [JAY AND CHERIE LAUGH]    
 Why are you laughing?    
 - You're ridiculous. 
- Oh, no.    
 I am not, uh, ridiculous.    
 CHERIE:  Okay.   
 - Then you are high. 
- Well, beside the point.    
 - [CHUCKLES] Mm-hmm. 
- Point is    
 I learned everything I know from those girls.    
 - "The Golden Girls"? 
- [CHUCKLES]

 Turning tricks.    
 Begging for the scraps.    
 Who do you think kept me company?    
 "The Golden Girls".    
  :   a.m. to  :   a.m.,

 JAY:  And you're not talking about p0rn?   
 - "The Golden Shower Girls"? 
- [CHERIE LAUGHS]    
 - That's disrespectful. 
- CHERIE:  Aw.   
 - He's so sensitive. 
- [LAUGHS]    
 No. Those saucy ladies, they made their own family.    
 So I did what they did.    
 You are my Blanche.    
 - Blanche? 
- And Jay?    
 You are...    
 - my Dorothy. 
- CHERIE:  Mm-hmm.   
 'Cause you're a little gay.    
 - Yeah.

 Of course I'm Betty White.

 Who wants to rob a bank?    
 f*ck, yeah.    
 [WHIRRING]    
 Will it get through my skin?    
 If it can't, nothing can.    
 HUGHIE:  Okay, I-I just feel like I need to say something.   
 I don't think this is a good idea.    
 Stormfront knows I leaked the V.    
 Yeah, but she hasn't come after you.    
 Ye... But that makes it so much worse.    
 That means that she has some fucked-up plan for me.    
 I need this chip out now.    
 I understand, Petit Hughie.    
 And though you've been covered with entrails of many a person, even a sea mammal... it's always harder when it's someone you love.    
 - What? 
 - L'amour.   
 No, no. No, I don't.    
 I mean, I-I do, of course.    
 It's just, it's a platon...

 That's what heroes do.

 Please.     
 That's a really good point.     
 [EXHALES] You know, sometimes it feels like... like the justice system just doesn't work anymore.
