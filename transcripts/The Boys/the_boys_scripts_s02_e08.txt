 Okay, this is insane.   
 We need more Compound V!   
 - Absolutely. 
- We need more Supes!   
 CROWD [CHANTING]: More Supes! More Supes!   
 More Supes! More Supes! More Supes!   
 More Supes! More Supes!   
 Come with me.   
 What are you doing here?    
 BUTCHER:  But on the bright side,   
 I'm sleeping in a basement beneath a pawnshop in East Flatbush.    
 We never wanted that for you.    
 HOMELANDER:  We all just have Ryan's best interests at heart.   
 I want us to be a family.    
 RYAN:  They just flew me up and showed me.   
 This house is fake, the neighbors are fake, you're fake.    
 No, Ryan!    
 You have five minutes to make your opening st...

 SHERIFF FLANAGAN:  There's a supervillain on your school campus.   
 - [SCREAMING] 
 - You hear the calls of distress.   
 You witness a violent display of superpowers.   
 What do you do?   
 I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,   
 and I'm here with Homelander to talk about school safety.   
 On the first report of an active supervillain,   
 a hero will immediately rush to your campus.   
 But to stay alive in the moment, remember,   
 stay calm and follow the law.   
 Lock all doors and windows.   
 Arm yourselves.   
 Your teacher should have an authorized firearm.   
 But use whatever you can.   
 And wait for a hero.   
 - [SCREAMING IN DISTANCE] 
- FLANAGAN:  Unfortunately,   
 the possibility that you will experience   
 a supervillain attack grows more likely every day.   
 But by having an action plan, you can dramatically increase   
 your chances of survival.   
 And survival is all that matters.

 - Jody, where's my flag pin? 
- How should I know?    
 Well, I can't go to this thing without a flag pin.    
 Bob, before he makes any decisions,    
 - just let me talk to him. 
- One, the president doesn't like you.    
 He used the word "standoffish".    
 And, two, he's decided.    
 He's declaring a national emergency, bypassing the FDA, and authorizing Compound V for use by law enforcement    
 - and first responders. 
- NEUMAN: Wait, Robert.    
 - Are you f*cking kidding me? 
- I wish I were.    
 Doses are going for five million a pop.    
 Pentagon's got a big order in, and ICE is next in line.    
 You can't release V into the mainstream.    
 We're talking an avalanche of Supes; it's suicide.    
 In one hour, I will be standing at the memorial service for the fallen heroes of the House attack, with my flag pin, giving my thoughts and prayers, and pledging to keep America safe.    
 The best way to do that is with Compound V.    
 NEUMAN: Yeah, we know. 
We were there. Remember?    
 Covered in my chief of staff's brains.    
 Look, there was no terrorist. It was Vought.    
 It's a f*cking coup.    
 - A bunch of their guys died, too. 
- To cover their own tracks.    
 For the record, I agree with you.    
 And I hate this.    
 But you've got no proof.    
 Folks are scared.    
 If Vought took a sh1t in the middle of Fifth Avenue, they'd throw a ticker-tape parade.    
 - Here's what we do have, Bob. 
- Oh, let me guess.    
 A tape of me f*cking my kids' nanny at her daughter's quinceañera?    
 Release it. Please. I'm begging you.    
 A plum gig at Fox, and this shithole in my rearview?    
 Sounds dreamy.    
 Okay, what if we got hard proof? A witness.    
 Anything.    
 SINGER: If you could get Jesus Christ himself, or maybe Homelander in front of a camera, sure.    
 I really am sorry.

 The RPG releases an electromagnetic pulse on impact.     
 Should cut through Stormfront's plasma bolts.     
 How sure are you?     
 It's a guesstimate.     
 So that's Stormfront.     
 And thanks to Starlight, we know that Noir needs only a f*ckin' tree nut.     
 How about A-Train?     
 Got enough epinephrine here to blow up that m*therf*cker's heart.     
 Hey, we can't just kill everyone.     
 That is exactly what we're gonna do.     
 Listen, you heard Mallory.     
 She said all we need is another witness.     
 Wile E. Coyote.     
 Always chases Roadrunner, always with an elaborate plan, always fails.     
 You know, I always say, "Why do this, Coyote?     
 All you need is an AR-  , and 'meep-meep' no more".     
 BUTCHER: Exactly. See?     
 We're just gonna shoot Roadrunner in the f*cking head.     
 That won't stop Vought. That-that won't stop Compound V.     
 If you kill these Supes, then Vought's just gonna make a thousand more.     
 Yeah, and we're gonna top those c**ts, too.     
 Great.     
 So that's settled. We're just supervillains now, huh?     
 Vought attacked the country, Hughie.     
 f*ck 'em all.     
 What if  I  testify?     
 Escaped convicts don't have a ton of credibility.     
 No, but maybe I know someone who does.     
 Give us the day.     
 Hughie?     
 See you later.     
 Officials are still trying to determine the perpetrator   
 of the capital attack, the Department of Homeland Security   
 has issued a crimson terror alert.   
 In Washington, all government buildings...   
 - How's Noir? 
- Unresponsive.     
 They don't think there's brain damage, but apparently it's hard to tell.     
 So, Noir's a vegetable,     
 Lamplighter's a charcoal briquette,     
 Starlight's in the breeze somewhere, and you're,     
 - what, fine with it? 
- Yes.     
 Because none of that matters anymore because of this.     
 So far, no terrorist group has claimed responsibility.   
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] All right, so, you didn't do this.     
 I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.     
 - But no, it wasn't me. 
- Right.     
 And there's no supervillains on American soil.     
 - None that we know of. 
- And that means...     
 ...it's Edgar.     
 Maybe. I mean, he is pretty smart, especially for his kind.     
 ...Compound V to members of the military

 Hey, smile.     
 This is good news.     
 Yes, there have been sacrifices, but we are this close to no more premieres or paparazzi, or screaming fans, or any of that dancing monkey sh1t.     
 We have to make sure that the right people get the doses, but it is a whole new world.     
 What about the wrong people?     
 Couple of billion of them.

 Because things are really bad, and...

 He publicly confessed to a sexual assault, Alastair.     
 And we've made a substantial investment in the Deep's rehabilitation.

 Two is weakness.     
 Stormfront has problems with him.     
 And at the moment, I have to indulge her.

 I understand that she was among your grandfather's first followers back when the Collective was a start-up.     
 I can neither confirm nor deny that.

 Stormfront's good at making people angry.     
 Angry people want Compound V.  Compound V raises our stock price.     
 Look, I'd have preferred V remained a secret, but we play with the cards we're dealt.     
 It's not ruthless, it's prices per share.

 'Cause that bitch should bother you.     
 Of course she does.     
 But it's not about me.     
 I can't lash out like some raging, entitled maniac.     
 That's a white man's luxury.     
 So, it's just business, then, eh?     
 When, Mr. Butcher, in history, has it ever been about anything different?     
 And what makes you think that you can control that racist bitch?     
 [SIGHS] Look, I've got to get across town...     
 Look, I can get the boy away from Homelander, all right?     
 How?     
 That's my business.     
 When I got him, I'll call your people, they zero in on this cell signal, and then come and scoop him up.     
 And then  you  do a better f*cking job of hiding him this time, yeah?     
 You have my word.     
 I will get Rebecca and Ryan somewhere safe.     
 No.     
 Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

 MALLORY: Let me handle Vought.      
 You think he'll turn into his father?      
 Becca didn't think so.      
 I pray she's right.      
 All the charges against you and the Boys have been dropped.      
 Even for the crimes you  did  commit.      
 You're a free man.      
 And the White House is opening an Office of Supe Affairs.      
 Victoria Neuman is the new czar.      
 She's sneaking me some off-the-books funding for a team that can keep tabs on the Supes.      
 If you're interested.

 Congratulations on the appointment, Congresswoman.      
 It's about time we had an Office of Supe Affairs.      
 Well, I know it was your intel that took Stormfront down.      
 So, thank you.      
 Yeah, and that's just the start.   
 We have enough dirt to ruin a dozen Supes.      
 Be a death blow for Stan Edgar.   
 That is, of course,  if you're open to, uh, expediting the Church's tax-exempt status.      
 Small price to pay.      
 Call my office, set up a meeting?   
 You are one of the good ones, Vic.      
 - See you soon. 
- See you.

 Hugh Campbell.      
 I don't know how to repay you for what you did. 
- You know, I can think of a way. 
- Oh?      
 You can... give me a job.      
 You serious?      
 Uh, what about your team?      
 Don't get me wrong, I-I-I still want to fight Vought, I just...      
 I want to do it the right way.      
 Not covered in quite as many guts.

- Look, the truth is,      
 I never totally fit in with the guys.      
 And... I think it's time I stand on my own two feet.
