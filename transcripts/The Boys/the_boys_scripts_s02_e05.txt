 They want us to believe that Vought superheroes are the only answer.   
 What else are they lying to us about?   
 A-Train, you're out.   
 - Out of what? 
 - Out of the Seven.   
 MAEVE:  I ended the relationship when I met you.   
 Stop f*cking lying to me.   
 And you love her?   
 We shouldn't feel so calm or 
safe. So, what are we gonna do?    
 Cross our fingers that Homelander's gonna save us?    
 I'm the face of the Seven.    
 I'm just trying to help.    
 MYRON:  Ain't you supposed to be a hero?   
 LIBERTY:  I am a hero.   
 VALERIE:  That's Liberty.   
 William Butcher?    
 I found Becca.    
 BUTCHER:  I'm gonna get you the f*ck out of here.   
 - I'm not leaving. 
- Becca, you and me...    
 - we could disappear. 
- I have a son!   
 He's a f*cking Supe freak.

 Liberty, that Supe that Raynor was looking into, turns out it's Stormfront.

 she probably murdered Raynor.

 It's your choice.
