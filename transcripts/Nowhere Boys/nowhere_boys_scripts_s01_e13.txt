 How about some music to cheer us up? 
 ♪ Water, Fire, Earth and Air... ♪ 
 Felix : I cast a spell to make Oscar walk again. 
 I didn't know that it would unmake all of us as well. 
 This is my sister, Alice. Ten years ago, Alice disappeared. 
 I know she was working on a spell and I think something went wrong. 
 That's the connection, and this is our way home. 
 Hey, guys? 
 The other boys are the other Elements! 
 Andy : Why us? 
 Because you have potential. 
 Potential for what? 
 Magic. 
 Something's missing. Oscar is the Fifth Element! 
 Oscar is the reason the spell was cast. 
 He is the connection between our world and your world. 
 I need your spirit to make this talisman work. 
 Why me? 
 Because in another world, you're my brother. 
 Whoa! 
 Divinity of the Elements, I summon thee. 
 Andy : Bates is possessed by a demon and he's trying to kill Felix. 
 Arggh! 
 No, Oscar! 
 Andy : Oscar was helping Bates? 
 Hey! 
 The demon has learnt to possess more than one body. 
 Help! Help!

 Season 1, Episode 13 
 So, Police and Rescue have searched here, here, and here, where the caves are. 
 Then let's look there again. 
 Well, we know for certain they were in there at some stage. 
 Right, well, let's move out in an ever-widening circle, ...from where the backpack was found. 
 Andy's backpack. 
 I'll bring caving equipment. We can re-search all the old mine shafts too. 
 That's a good idea. 
 Look, I'll be the last searcher to leave this forest, but... 
 It's been 11 days now. 
 Andy was obsessed with that survivalist Bear, uh... 
 Grylls. 
 I'm sure he would have picked up salient information. 
 Sam knows a lot about surviving in the wilderness. 
 And Felix. He's a tough kid and he's been through a lot. 
 Let's go and find our boys. 
 (Siren wails) 
 Bates, what are you doing? 
 Felix : Help! 
 A wand and a mug? 
 Chalice. Good, that too. 
 But hang on, so, Felix did a magic spell which brought you to our world, but none of you were ever born? 
 I know, it doesn't make any rational sense. 
 It sounds pretty crazy. 
 How do you think we know all those things about you... 
 Like your crush on Robert Pattinson? 
 He's mine. 
 What else do we need? 
 Dried snake skins, bat wings, toad tongue, and sage and chilli powder. 
 So, if this mad story really is true, why has Felix been kidnapped by a demon? 
 It's a restoring demon, meant to restore order by any means necessary. 
 Will incense help? 
 Uh, no. 
 So, if the demon kills Felix, then the magic spell dies with him? 
 Ellen! 
 Does that mean we get to go home? 
 Uh, possibly, or you might just vanish into nothingness. Poof! 
 What are you getting at, Sam? 
 Felix tricked us, and lied to us! 
 Felix deserves to be punished, but not by human sacrifice. 
 Look, Bates may be a pain, but I don't want my mum married to a killer. 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Bring all that. 
 We're ready. 
 Alright, so, where is Bates taking Felix? 
 Restoring demons are creatures of habit. 
 The forest! That's where the wormhole appeared. 
 And that's where Alice cast her spell. 
 And where Roland attacked us! 
 (Siren wails) 
 Jake! 
 Oh, hey. I went to come visit you at the hospital, but you were gone. 
 Fully recovered. The doctors can't explain what happened. 
 Did we go out in your world? 
 Unfortunately, in my world, I kind of disgust you. 
 I don't believe that! 
 You're a goth, and Felix is your best friend. 
 Now I really don't believe it. 
 When you see the other me, show her this. 
 It belonged to my nan. 
 Thanks. 
 Most boys are such morons. 
 When I finally fall for one, he turns out to be from another dimension. 
 Typical. 
 You left me this, didn't you? 
 Yep. 
 How do you know I love dolphins? 
 Who are you, Jake? 
 Look, this might sound a little crazy, but, well, just imagine a world where... 
 You and Gary had that kid when you were teenagers. 
 How do you know about that? Did Gary put you up to this? 
 Gary didn't say a word. I know this, because... 
 Well, just imagine what that kid would look like now. 
 He'd be a teenage boy, just like you. 
 When I get home, I'm gonna be an awesome boyfriend to you. 
 Except you won't be you - or at least, not  this  you. 
 'Cause here we're just getting to know each other. 
 Well, future ex-boyfriend, it's been great to know you. 
 That demon isn't gonna fight itself. 
 Bye, Mum. 
 Bye, Jakie. 
 (Siren wails) 
 Felix : Oscar! 
 (Siren silences) 
 Pull over to the side of the road! This is the police, Sgt Riles! 
 Repeat, pull over to the side of the road. 
 Be quiet! 
 Why didn't you stop? 
 Both : I didn't feel like it. 
 Bates, have you been drinking? 
 Felix : Help! 
 Who's that? 
 Just a bag of flesh. 
 Let me out, please! 
 Alright, out of the car! 
 Both of you! Move it! 
 Felix : Watch out, Sgt Riles! 
 Stay there! Don't make me draw my weapon! 
 Mate, we've got trouble, the road to the Bremin Forest. 
 Felix : Sgt Riles! 
 Can you hear me? 
 Chase? 
 Both : Chase. 
 (Chickens cluck) 
 Roland! 
 Roland! 
 You really know how to freak someone out, man! 
 Can't I get a moment's peace in this forest? Come on. 
 Guys, what are we actually gonna do in the forest? 
 Well, we're not going on a picnic. 
 We're off to fight a demon who wants to kill us. 
 It wants to kill Felix. 
 But if we get in the way? 
 Andy, have you got a spell that'll make us invisible? 
 I'm looking! Hopefully the right spell to disarm the demon. 
 Do you even know what you're looking for? 
 He's the Brainiac dude! He'll find it. 
 No pressure, yeah. 
 Wrong. Pressure. 
 Heaps of pressure. 
 It's all my fault. 
 I was trying to help Oscar, but I just ruined everything, for everyone. 
 I should let the demon do its job. 
 Here I am! 
 Felix : Come get me! 
 I'm not afraid of you anymore! 
 Listen, there is weird, like me, and there is plain stupid like you are being now. 
 I deserve to die... 
 Oh, stop with the theatrics! 
 Now, that place in the forest, this isn't the first time something like this has happened there. 
 The big question is... 
 Can you fix it? 
 If I can make this work, I think I can use it to get us home. 
 I think I've fixed it. 
 That sounds like a plan. And I'll help you. 
 Yes, but it won't dispel the demon without the others around. 
 Well, that's part two of the plan, then, isn't it? 
 Come on, let's go find them. 
 Let's not. 
 Back off! 
 What - we're supposed to be scared of this little tyke? 
 (High-pitched shrieking) 
 Demon : Our powers are evolving, Felix. You have no hope. 
 Go find the others before it possess you too. 
 Run! 
 Fight it, Oscar! Fight it! 
 Is that the best you can do? 
 Dad must have caught up to them, but... 
 ...Which way did they go? 
 Let's use magic to find them. 
 Seriously? 
 So, are those all spells? 
 There must be some kind of tracking spell in here. 
 If Felix can work it out, I'm sure I can. 
 It's not a matter of working it out, Andy. It's in you or it's not. 
 I mean, I tried for years and not a biscuit. 
 I'm sure it's in me! Felix said we had potential. 
 When you're scared and your path is blocked, all you have to do is knock. 
 Sounds like a nursery rhyme. 
 Or a  self-help  book. 
 Hear my chant, hear my spell, spirit from the other side, in this time that we now dwell, take us across the great divide! 
 Or we could do it the old-fashioned way. 
 Got my tracking badge in Scouts. Come on, this way. 
 We gonna walk, or you gonna summon a magic carpet? 
 "Ha, ha." 
 What are you doing?! What do you want from me?! 
 Help! 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 Both : That way! 
 If we're looking for the altar, it's up that way! 
 But the twister came from that way! 
 Alice was here. 
 We've seen signs like this before. 
 (Thunder rumbles) 
 It's starting. 
 Come on, this way! 
 You better be right. 
 Wait! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, and Air, Elements that we all share! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, and Air, Elements that we all share! 
 (Thunder cracks) 
 The demon! 
 No, no, it's me - Roland. 
 Whoa, dude, you scared us! 
 Have you seen Felix? 
 There! 
 (Wind whistles) 
 Oh! 
 Soon the disturbance will be gone. The troubles will be over. 
 Will my friends return home? 
 All the troubles will be gone. 
 They've got nothing to do with this! 
 You think this is just you. 
 It IS just me, I swear it! 
 I'm the one with the magic. 
 It was never just you. 
 Soon order will be restored. 
 It's activated. The guys must be here! 
 Phoebe! 
 (Growling) 
 Arggh! 
 Oscar! 
 Oscar! 
 Felix, what's happening? 
 Get me out of here! Untie me! 
 Andy : They've got Roland! 
 I don't feel too good. 
 Oh, great, you just swapped Roland for Oscar! 
 Demon : Restore order! 
 Oscar! Oscar! 
 Are you ready? 
 Sorry, Dad. 
 Arggh! 
 Phoebe : Sam! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, and Air, Elements that we all share! 
 Water, Fire, Earth, and Air, Elements that we all share! 
 Quick! They're getting weaker! The spell's working! 
 Hurry, Andy! I need my bag! 
 What now? 
 My phone! 
 I must have dropped it! You wanna make a call... 
 Just look for it! 
 Phoebe! 
 Alice! 
 Alice : Order must be restored! 
 Order must be restored! 
 The talisman's losing power! They're fighting back! 
 I'll look for it! 
 The original unmaking spell is on my phone. 
 If we cast it again, it'll unmake itself. 
 Everything will go back to the way it was. 
 Found it! 
 (Shrieks) 
 It's Alice! 
 Alice is the demon? 
 Yes! 
 Keep the demons away from Andy! 
 Protect Andy!

 Jake : What happened? 
 Where's Phoebe? 
 Where's Oscar? 
 Where are  we? 
 There they are! 
 Let's attack! 
 Seriously? 
 Wait, wait! 
 It's loser dad! 
 Are you sure? 
 Look at the clothes he's wearing, it's totally loser dad! Awesome! 
 We're home! 
 They're here! (Blows whistle) 
 Whoo! 
 They're here! 
 Andy! 
 Andy! 
 You're alive! 
 I'm sorry, I meant... 
 Come here! 
 Um, I'm so sorry for what I put you through, Sam. 
 It's OK. We're home. Freak! 
 You can call me freak. 
 Don't worry, dude. It's just the beginning. 
 Man : Sam! 
 Man : Felix! 
 Dad! 
 Sam! 
 Dad! 
 Hey! 
 Dad... 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 (Lighter clicks) 
 So, what did you eat and where did you sleep? 
 Can I tell you tomorrow? I'm so beat. 
 Just as long as you don't leave anything out. 
 I'll tell you everything. 
 Don't go away again. 
 I can't believe you dumped me for a jock, a nerd, and a moron! 
 I know - wrong on so many levels... 
 But I missed you. 
 Missed you too. 
 No, I really missed you. 
 Woman : Here you are. You must be starved. 
 I am so, so, so, so, so, so glad to have you home. 
 How glad, Mum? 
 I am so, so glad, that I made you... 
 Your favourite for our picnic. 
 BLT. 
 What else? 
 Awesome, Mum. 
 So, your teacher... 
 Mr Bates dropped in to see me a few times while you were gone. He's a lovely man. 
 Bates? 
 Mmm, forgot the mayo! 
 Wait there, I'll be back. 
 Yeah, you two attacked me, and when I tried to talk to you, Mum, you just had a panic attack. 
 Goodness sake, what a story! 
 Oh, and Mia had this new boyfriend named Sammy, who was like what I used to be  Boy : A moron? 
 (Laughter) 
 And Ellen, that goth chick, she was your best friend. 
 She hates me. 
 Here, sweetheart, let me serve you. 
 Thanks, Mum. 
 Boy : Looks great, Mum. 
 Hey, Sam? 
 Hmm? 
 Could we have a little talk later? 
 Yeah, sure. Is everything OK? 
 Man : Can somebody give me a hand, please? 
 You must have missed your grandmother's food. 
 Not so much as you would think. 
 Everyone's talking about you at school. 
 Really? 
 'What's the nerd done now?' 
 Are you alright, Mum? 
 When they found the food that we packed and your poncho on the walking track... 
 I thought... 
 It's all OK now, honey. 
 Ay, ay, dirty hands, you wash clean? 
 Right, well, that thing's cactus. Going to get some matches. 
 Oh! I'll try. 
 (Sneezes) 
 Oscar : Bless you. 
 God, hayfever must be early this year. 
 Do you want me to get your antihistamines? 
 Ellen : Yeah, I'll help, Osky. 
 Now, where'd I put them? It's alright, love. 
 Oh! 
 I think they're in your handbag. 
 Are they? 
 (Shrieks) 
 (Sneezes) 
 Bates...? 
 (Deep rumbling) 
 Whoa! 
 This is where it all began. 
 I know. 
 Except the magic shop wasn't locked up when I went missing. 
 I've only been gone two weeks. 
 It's not over yet. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because something's happening. I can feel it. 
 She's here.
