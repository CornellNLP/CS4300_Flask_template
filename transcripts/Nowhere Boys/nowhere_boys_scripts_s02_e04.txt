 It looks like Andy was using magic he didn't understand and couldn't control. 
 Felix here and his friends chased him into the bush - what do you expect us to think? 
 If you have any information, please contact the police. 
 Did you hear? They found Andy in Rochford. 
 Someone phoned in a sighting. 
 What? 
 I don't think they think Andy's in Rochford. 
 They're not telling us something. We'll just have to find out for ourselves. 
 So no sign of Andy at all? This call was a hoax. 
 I could organise a time with the school counsellor. 
 Mr North...? 
 Your subconscious spilling the beans is not awesome, Sam. 
 My office, lesson five. 
 How'd it go with the police - OK? 
 I feel your pain. 
 Mention it again and you'll feel my fist. 
 How did you know about this? 
 I just drew what was in my head. 
 If we got close to Alice and I made a connection, I could sense where her book is. 
 Oscar knows where Alice's book is and Alice does too. 
 Alice beat us to it. 
 Now, this is bad. 
 Really, really bad. 
 (Theme music) 
 Season 2, Episode 4 
 (Birds chirping) 
 Well, at least we know Oscar's power works. 
 Not tha it helped. Any chance of us getting Andy back disappeared with that book. 
 Then we have to get creative. 
 We got creative. 
 We created a water demon, remember? 
 If we had a real Water Element, we could do a tracking spell. 
 One snag with that, hombre - our Water Element got vacuumed up into the sky, remember? 
 We could find someone else. 
 Wait, there's another Water Element? 
 Possibly. 
 You weren't the only ones with potential. 
 I thought we were special. 
 You'll always be special to me, Sam. 
 Well, if there's another slightly less awesome Water Element out there, how do we find it? 
 Roland. 
 Roland's a Water Element...? 
 Whoa! 
 Let's bail. 
 He'll find us sooner or later. 
 You guys get out of here. I'll go talk to our friendly detective. 
 Let's go. 
 We know it was you, Felix. 
 We traced the call from the exchange to here. 
 There's no doubt that it came from this house. 
 I... didn't make any call. Somebody's got it wrong. 
 Why would someone make a false statement about a missing person? 
 Detective, my son just told you he wasn't responsible. 
 Then who was? 
 I was... just trying to help. 
 Oh, Felix... 
 Andy said his family used to go to Rochford when he was a kid. 
 For holidays. 
 He liked it there because it was away from everything. 
 You failed to mention this in your interview because...? 
 It wasn't until after... 
 I was thinking about Andy and it came to me. 
 You do realise it's an offence to make a false statement to a police officer? 
 Please, Detective Murphy, my son is stressed and he made a mistake. 
 Hm... 
 If there's anything else you've forgotten to tell me, contact me direct. 
 I'll make sure he does. 
 I'll see you out. 
 Thank you. We will speak again. 
 It's alright. I'll tell them it was me. 
 It's no use both of us being on Roland's hit list. 
 Felix, up. I'm not finished with you yet. You've got some explaining to do. 
 Then I called the police and told them I'd seen Andy in Rochford. 
 But it wasn't true. 
 Crazy boy. 
 Why would you do that? 
 Are you some kind of sociopath? 
 I thought Andy would be coming home. 
 Um, I'm so sorry... 
 I didn't mean... 
 Save your apologies for Andy. 
 The first 48 hours are crucial in a missing person's case and your lie just wasted heaps of them. 
 Viv... 
 You should listen to your daughter. 
 Mum. 
 Michael, Nicole, Lily... 
 If we can help in any way, you just let us know, OK? 
 Mrs Lau, Andy will be OK. I know it. 
 (Felix's mum sighs) Come on. 
 Password, of course. Why would you make this easy? 
 "Bear Grylls". 
 Hmph. 
 Hm... 
 "Ninja". 
 No need to rub it in... 
 (Reads) 1.618 
 The golden ratio that appears in all forms of nature and science. 
 Such a nerd... Now, what have you been up to? 
 What...? 
 So you want to be a powerful magician? 
 Magic...? 
 No way... 
 Anything? 
 Nothing. 
 I guess it's a lot harder to find Andy than some book. 
 Felix... 
 What about the other Water Element? 
 Do you think you could find that? 
 I don't hear a lot of sorting going on out there! 
 Less talking, more sorting, thank you. 
 You have to hand it to her - Mum is an expert at cruel and unusual punishment. 
 Never gonna get through all this. 
 Thank you for covering for me. 
 I was trying to buy you more time, but I messed it up - of couse. 
 No, you did help, Oskie. You were right about Alice's book. 
 Just like you were about the other universe in your comic. 
 Yeah, about that... 
 Sorry I tore it up. 
 You know I had to try, right? 
 No - I mean, I know... 
 You can draw another one, maybe! 
 Felix! 
 What I drew in the comics, you said that really happened? 
 Well, does that mean that... in the other universe I could walk? 
 I didn't know how to tell you. 
 Sorry. 
 But... I didn't have a brother? 
 Well, in this universe, I win. 
 Where've you been? 
 Here, working everything out. 
 Grab a brush. This hard work thing is meant to be good for you. 
 So is exercise, but I've managed to avoid that. 
 Why not? 
 Having something handmade is supposed to bring good energy. 
 What do you think? 
 Seems like a lot of effort for good luck. 
 I just want everything to go well, that's all. 
 We're a good team. 
 When we work together. 
 So how do we find this Water Element? 
 Yeah, what made you choose us for your bizarro magic family? 
 It wasn't an exact science. First, I had to establish your Elements. 
 Earth, Fire, Air and Water. 
 Exactly. It's like star signs. 
 Everyone is born with an elemental nature, but what I really had to find was four elements with magical potential. 
 Jake, on the 13th of February, during a daily bullying ritual... 
 Mikey! Come back! 
 Come on, Mikey. What are you running for? 
 Come on, Mike, we're having fun. 
 Where'd he go? That way? 
 No... 
 I'd been following you for weeks. 
 And then I saw it. 
 (Gasps) 
 How'd you do that? 
 I see nerd people. 
 I could tell that wasn't just a guess. 
 Lunch. (Chuckling) 
 Sharing's caring, Mikey. 
 And, Sam, without even seeing what was about to happen... 
 ...It was crazy - they were screaming my name. 
 Sam!? 
 You weren't even looking. 
 Anyway, where was I? 
 Which brings us to Andy. 
 And Bates' once-a-semester math-lympics. 
 Next to answer correctly will be crowned champion math-lete. 
 Ahem. 
 The number that appears in all... 
 1.618 - the golden ratio... 
 ...Is the number that appears in all forms of nature and science. 
 Correct. Well, yes, that's incredible, Andy. 
 Uh... 
 So you win. Well done. You don't. Sit down. 
 I knew Andy was a nerd, but this was different. 
 And I was right - you all have magical potential. 
 What about Mike...? 
 He does have a sort of similar intelligence to Andy. 
 Maximum nerdage! 
 Dylan? He's a master of water bombs. 
 Once he hit someone through the window of a moving bus. 
 It's a long shot, but... 
 Lachlan? 
 No, not him. 
 Can't get closer to water than captain of the swim team. 
 Now we test them. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 Behind you. 
 Good catch. 
 Thanks for the heads-up. 
 You're welcome. 
 So, um... are you new? 
 Come on, Jake! 
 Do I need to remind you we're in the middle of something? 
 Who was that? 
 Come on. 
 Sure Lachlan came through here. 
 (Gasps) The shrink! 
 Boys... 
 You can come out now. 
 Can you make a spell that makes me immune to hypnotism? 
 You don't need magic, just mind power. 
 That's what I'm afraid of. 
 Focus your energy on the one thing. 
 Fortify the mind. 
 
 
 
 Hey, there's Lachlan. 
 Ah! 
 Perfect timing, gentlemen. We were about to search your lockers. 
 Oh, don't worry. If you've nothing to hide, there's nothing to worry about. 
 Is there...? 
 Detective, I'm sure there won't be. 
 Boys? 
 What, don't they feed you at home, kid? 
 I have an uber-high metabolism. It's a condition. 
 Hm. (Insect buzzes) 
 This is a locker, Jake. Not a dirty clothes basket. 
 Nothing suspicious there. 
 We want to find Andy as much as anyone. 
 A rubbish skip seemed like an odd place to start. 
 I don't miss much, Felix. 
 Long story short - I'll find out  exactly  what happened to Andy. 
 I think I've got everything I need. 
 I'll catch you boys later. 
 Alright, show's over, everyone. 
 Listen, none of this can be easy, so if you ever wanna talk... 
 Let me guess, you're here for me. 
 Of course you are. 
 Excuse me, I'm still your teacher, Jake. 
 Yeah, that's right and nothing more. 
 Move along. 
 Sorry about the... about the smell. 
 Um... 
 I don't like to wash my socks after a footy win, for luck. 
 Does it work? 
 I'm the best kick on the team. 
 You're not too bad yourself, from what I saw. 
 Really? 
 Yeah... 
 Ah-ahem. 
 How long have you creeps been there? 
 Long enough. 
 "Best kick on the team", huh? 
 Shouldn't we be following our Water Element? 
 It'd be quicker if we split up and take one each. 
 Let's see what we can find, meet up later. 
 What do you think the cops were looking for? 
 I don't know. 
 Those boys know something about what happened to my brother. 
 What tipped you off? The huge police investigation? 
 This is different. I found something. 
 OK, here we are. 
 Meet me in the library. 
 Wow, not crazy at all. 
 Mia, Ellen. Meet Saskia, Bremin High's newest student. 
 Ellen, would you mind buddying up, showing her the lay of the land, so to speak? 
 Newbie-babysitting? Kill me now. 
 Thank you. Knew I could count on you. 
 Ready. 
 I know. 
 This is my excited face. 
 Mike. Hey, mate. Um... 
 I was just wondering if you knew anything about the golden... 
 The what? 
 You know, that science thing...? 
 You're interested in science? So am I! 
 Um... 
 Kind of. 
 Great. 
 (Thud!) (Both laugh) 
 Nice one, Dylan. 
 Oi! Hey! 
 Personally, I'm far more interested in the natural sciences. 
 Much more fascinating than mathematical theories, don't you think? 
 Um... yeah... 
 Have you seen that double rainbow video? 
 I've seen it, like, 200 times. 
 Seen Dylan? 
 Over there. 
 Where? 
 Oh, no. 
 Better run, Dracula. This one's got holy water in it. 
 (Grunting and laughter) 
 Whatever's going on, I'll bet it has something to do with these. 
 What are they? 
 They're magic websites. 
 I found them in Andy's internet history. 
 Andy was always weird, but he wasn't... magic weird. 
 Are you sure the boys aren't in league with sparkly vampires and werewolves with amazing abs? 
 Can you be serious for like five minutes? 
 We are talking about magic. How serious can it be? 
 So Felix has been jumpy and secretive since he came back. 
 He's always been jumpy and secretive. 
 He wouldn't hide something that would help find Andy. 
 Hey! 
 Is this really what I look like? 
 That's actually a good ID photo. You look really pretty. 
 You think so? 
 You should borrow some books. Go forth and feast on knowledge. 
 OK. Thanks. 
 If you're sure they've got nothing to hide, then why don't you ask them about these? 
 Magic? No way. None of us know anything about magic, at all. 
 Except for Felix. 
 Well, yeah. 
 And maybe Andy? 
 I guess. 
 Probably Jake too. 
 A little bit. 
 You've gone from swearing none of you know anything about magic to admitting you all do. 
 I did...? 
 You creep around with Sam and Jake like the demented Three Musketeers and you're being investigated by the police. 
 But everyone else is crazy and there's nothing going on? 
 When you put it like that, it sounds... 
 Delusional? 
 Is there anything you wanna tell me? 
 Why does everyone keep asking me that? 
 When did I become 'everyone'? 
 Wanna know something I haven't told you? Fine. 
 When I was lost in the forest, I thought about you. 
 Whatever. What kind of things? 
 I don't know. 
 How much you hate boy bands, how you paint your little fingernail a different colour, how you wear that bracelet we bought although you've fixed it six times. 
 But it's all been so crazy with Andy gone, doesn't seem right to focus on anything else, even if it is important to me. 
 Sorry. Hopeless at this. 
 Yeah, terrible. 
 Come here. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Dude, Mike is a total bust. I think I should follow one of the others. 
 ___ 
 Look, babe, all this magic stuff, it's not what you think. 
 I saw this shrink and he says that when I talk about magic, it's just me trying to cover up trauma, or something. 
 Like my brain doesn't want me to remember me being lost. 
 I wouldn't lie to you. 
 Then why didn't you tell me? 
 Just didn't want you to worry. 
 (Message tone on mobile) 
 There seems to be a lot of things you don't want me to worry about. 
 I just remembered that I have to be somewhere. 
 Mia! 
 You're always in the last place I look. 
 Good news - your Mum's really keen for us to get started, so let's kick off. 
 Why not? My day's already going so well. 
 Viv : This could form a major part of the police investigation. 
 No way - we're not dobbing them in to the cops. 
 You'd've rather they get away with it? 
 With what? 
 They may have lied, but they're not criminals. 
 I think this is the part where you're meant to back me up. 
 What if they're into something they can't get out of? 
 The police might be able to help. 
 Like the detective said, if they've got nothing to hide, they have nothing to worry about. 
 Why don't you let us find out what's going on? 
 If there really is something bad, you can go to the cops and we'll come with you. 
 We will...? 
 The police have already tried asking straight out. 
 We would be a little more... subtle. 
 (Ticking) 
 OK, so, uh, close your eyes. We're going to get into the zone. 
 So, I want you to just listen to the sound of my voice. 
 I'm gonna count slowly, backwards, from five. 
 Five... 
 Focus the mind. 
 Four... 
 Focus the mind. 
 Three... 
 Focus the mi... 
 Let your breathing become slower and steadier as you relax. 
 Two... 
 Focus the... 
 And one. (Snaps fingers) 
 OK. 
 So... we're now back in the forest. 
 Dappled light coming in through the leaves, the big green trees and the soft undergrowth... 
 Can you see the forest? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 OK, so... 
 What do you remember of your time there? 
 I... ate scrambled eggs. 
 Nice work. What else do you remember? 
 I ate... mouldy doughnuts from a bin. 
 Alright, go on. 
 I ate pig trotters. They were pretty good. 
 Mm-hm. 
 I ate a whole table of Chinese food. 
 OK, can you remember anything other than food? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 Jake's porridge. 
 That wasn't food. 
 Best friends since primary school and now I'm supposed to be spying on him. 
 It was your idea. 
 I had to stop Viv going to the cops somehow. 
 Why is even any of this our problem? 
 I don't even know how I feel about Sam anymore. 
 Trouble in perfect-couple land? 
 (Sighs) I just feel like since Sam's come back, he's a different person. 
 I just... I don't even know if I can trust him at all. 
 There's something I have to do. I'll see you later. 
 Sam! 
 Mia. Hey. 
 Want some? I ate heaps for lunch and I'm starving. It's weird. 
 Can we talk? 
 I thought we talked already. 
 Just tell me the truth. Right now. 
 About what? 
 You know what. 
 About what happened to you, what happened to Andy, why you keep running off with Jake and Felix. 
 Either you tell me now, or... 
 Or what? 
 Or I don't think we can be together anymore. 
 Well...? 
 There's nothing going on. 
 OK, Sam, if that's how you want it to be. 
 Mia! 
 Bye, Sam. 
 How'd it go with Lachlan? 
 The shrink got me. 
 And you spilled your guts? 
 No. 
 My mind's a fortress, but my heart... it's a whole other story. 
 Mia... 
 Mia dumped me. 
 We all kind of saw that coming. 
 Harsh, Felix. 
 Sorry. 
 I'd say the search for the Water Element was an epic fail. 
 Oi! (Gasping) 
 Incoming! 
 How are you doing that? 
 I don't know, I tried to catch it. 
 "Magical potential". 
 More like "magic". She controlled water. 
 It's OK. You're the one we're looking for. 
 Look. 
 What are they doing with her? 
 A girl like Saskia shouldn't have that much magical power. 
 What - more than you? 
 More than any of us. 
 I have to tell you something in private. 
 Don't hate me. 
 Maybe Viv's right, maybe this needs to be a police thing now. 
 Ready to reconstruct the scene of Andy's disappearance? 
 You wanna charge us, then do it; otherwise we don't have to be here. 
 People who say that usually have something to hide. 
 We think Andy might be in the other universe. 
 You can't be serious. 
 I've reworked the unmaking spells. We can travel between the universes. 
 So, about dinner at my place tonight. 
 I'm having dinner at your place? 
 Yeah, tonight. 
 (Coughs and spits) 
 What's going on? 
 This. 
 Stop! I'm filming everything. What have you done to Jake?
