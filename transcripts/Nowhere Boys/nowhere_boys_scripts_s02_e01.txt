 I cast a spell to make Oscar walk again. 
 I didn't know it would unmake all of us. 
 Everything is exactly like home, but it's not. 
 Like a different version of the same reality. 
 Did we go out in your world? 
 Unfortunately, in my world, I kind of disgust you. 
 When you see the other me, show her this; it belonged to my Nan. 
 This is special. It can protect against elemental attacks. 
 There are four worldly elements - Earth, Fire, Air and Water, and then a fifth element - Spirit. 
 Oscar is the fifth element. 
 There's a demon trying to kill us. 
 A restoring demon, created to restore the natural order after a magical disturbance. 
 Ten years ago, my sister Alice disappeared. 
 Phoebe. 
 Alice! 
 Order must be restored. 
 The original unmaking spell! 
 If we cast it again, everything will go back to the way it was. 
 ♪ Walk upon this earth again ♪ 
 We're home! 
 Mr Bates dropped in to see me a few times while you were gone. He's a lovely man. 
 Bates? 
 It's not over yet. I can feel it. 
 She's here.

 This is Michelle Keats reporting live from Bremin with a story that has captivated the country. 
 After two weeks missing in rugged terrain, the Bremin Four have returned, and they're about to make their first media appearance. 
 Will we finally hear the truth about what happened to them? 
 There has been some speculation already that it may all be a hoax. Wormholes, alternate universes, magic - they all exist, and I have proof. Watch. I can't believe they want you to talk to the press right now. We get it over with and they'll leave us alone. Hello! Hello! The superstar's father is in the building! You want a coffee? Yeah, I haven't had breakfast. Oh, well, help yourself. You're coming to watch, right? 'Cause I'm gonna mention you. Please don't. Look: there's been so much going on right now, we haven't had a chance to talk. We can talk at the party tomorrow. What party? Our official welcome-home. Vince organised it. I know I was a terrible boyfriend before, but I'm the new and improved Sam; you'll see. There you are! Come on - tuck your shirt in. This is national TV. You know what you're going to say? Yes, Mum. You're home. You're home! Oh, you're home! We'll all be watching from the front row. OK... This is it. Everyone's gonna be looking at us. I know... This is our chance to tell the world... We're not telling the world anything. We're going to be legends. No, really, I mean it. Magic has to be kept a secret. Dude, chill. This is gonna be sweet. (Reporters all talk at once) One at a time! Please. Andy, is there anything you want to say to the people who searched for you? Wormholes, alternate universes... They all exist. What he means is, um... Thank you to everyone who didn't give up on us. We wouldn't be here without you. But how did you survive? Jake, what did you eat? Um, we ate... What did we eat? We found, ah, berries...? And we ate Andy's pawpaw ointment. It was thinking of my girlfriend, Mia, that got me through. I was pretty scared, but I couldn't give up. How do you boys explain the fact you have no symptoms of dehydration or exposure? It all comes down to transdimensional quantum physics. No, it doesn't. Yes, it does. You survived in the forest because... physics? We survived because we stuck together. We didn't go off on our own. But that still doesn't explain why the search party found no sign of you. Do you want me to repeat the question? Felix...? Sorry, what? Why didn't anyone find any trace of you in the forest? No fire, no shelter, no tracks, nothing? Um, I'm not sure. Maybe they weren't looking in the right place. Helicopters were scouring the area as well as search parties on the ground. If you weren't actually in trouble, the resources wasted would be... Earthquake! Take shelter! Man : That way, that way. We have to get out of here. Come on! What was that? Bremin is not on any fault lines. It was you, wasn't it? I couldn't help it. Whoa, hang on. Since when could you make the ground shake? Since we got back. Whenever I turn a tap on, the water goes crazy. I sneezed and made the washing line spin around. Crossing universes. Maybe it's giving us elemental powers somehow. You're fire, right? You must have a fire power. I'll show you, but not here. We need to get out of sight. Our parents are gonna kill us. Come on! This morning's press conference was interrupted by an unusual seismic disturbance that has yet to be explai... No! Come on. Stupid thing. (Jangling) Hello...? Hello? Alice? Alice? Alice! Superheroes need superhero names. You could be "Jake the Quake" and you could be "Wet Andy". That would make you "Airhead". Look - the same as in the other universe. OK, show us your stuff. Whoa... Seriously awesome, dude. Spontaneous combustion. You can control it. Kind of. How do you do that? (Text alert) My mum. Uh-oh. I think they've noticed we're gone. Again. I should go home. No! We have to stick together. Dude, we're home now. Nothing is chasing us. Alice is here. I saw her. The restoring demon? How? She must have come through somehow when we did. What for? There's no restoring to do. We belong here. The talisman doesn't. You still have it, don't you? Sorry, I'm not just gonna hand it over. It's the only thing that can protect us. Our powers can protect us. You can't even control them. Then show us how! You kind of owe us, Felix. You're really here. Where were you? It doesn't matter. You can tell me later. Let me take you to the doctor. The magic shop... They closed it. My things... Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. I need the Book of Shadows. No, you need to sleep. You're safe now. No... Rest, just rest. Ssh. Want me to pull your finger? Maybe I need to sneeze. There might be a physical trigger. Gross, dude! You're supposed to be aiming for the can. There must be a process. Every action has a reaction. Tell us how you do it. I don't know  how  I do it. How do you catch a football? I hold out my arms, and I catch. I tried that once. Didn't work. If magic is like science, then it can be learned. How did you make the ground shake? I don't know. (Snaps fingers) I saw Bates with my mum, and that freaked me out. OK... Try remembering that feeling, harnessing it. OK. OK... And remember - kiss me again, Mr Bates! (Air kisses) Keep doing that. Ooh, Mr Bates, I love you! Mwah, mwah, mwah! You're doing it! Hey, did you guys see that? OK, my turn! Did you see that? (Laughs) Yeah! Come on, Andy. Your turn, mate. You ready? Focus, Andy. Go for the can, go for the can! Concentrate... Aw, dude! I know what we can call him now - Drip Boy. You have to try using the power of your mind. I have an IQ of 144! I use the power of my mind more than any of you! Yeah, our powers can barely defeat tin cans. No way we're ready for a restoring demon. Talisman. I need to come up with a plan. We could help. Yes, you could! No more talk of alternate universes and magical wormholes. THAT will help. He needs food and rest, not decoration for his room. My mother give this to me. I put it up. It's a silly superstition. It will protect from the evil spirits. I don't need protecting, Nainai. Ow! Yes, you do, you silly boy. Eat something. Mum, we just had dinner. Eat! I'm fine too, if anyone's interested. Come on, Mum. You don't all have to check on me every ten minutes. Yes, we do. When you have kids, you'll understand. I'm not a kid! I can take care of myself. I can do... Stuff. What is this really about? I don't want to be Nerdy Andy, Dad. I guess I was what they would call nerdy when I was your age... But look at me now! Thanks, Dad. Goodnight, son. Mum's ready to kill you. The happy-to-have-me-back look has worn off? 
 
 I've been practising my power, trying to find Alice. What I really need is Phoebe. She will know what to do. While you were gone, I couldn't help with the search, and I had to do something. You drew this? This is amazing, Oskie. I love it. How did you know about this? I don't know. But this really happened. I just drew what was in my head. Reckon you can draw where Phoebe is? I can try. I won't let anything happen to you again. I promise. Looks like Phoebe has thrown everything out. You ready? I don't know if I can get an exact address. It's coming. Anything? She's afraid. Hang on. 'All deliveries to 100 Stuckey Lane.' Found her. Let's get the others. Anything? Nothing. Look - it's me, skating over the bins. How did you do this? Oscar is Spirit in that universe and this one. So you've got a power? Way to go. There she is. You really think she's gonna tell us how to defeat her sister? Only one way to find out. Phoebe? Phoebe? Hello? Uh, private property. What are you doing in here? We need your help. You used to slink around my shop. The rest of you, I've never met. You want help, try your parents. Dude, she doesn't know us in this universe. And there is no universe in which I wanna know you; move it! Wait, can we just... Your sister is a demon. Alice tried to kill us. She was in this hurricane thing... What...? What's going on? Nothing. Go back to bed. Water, Fire, Earth and Air, elements that we all share. What is that? Water, Fire, Earth and Air, elements that we all share. OK, bad teenage poetry is the last straw. It's not glowing. So there's no danger? I don't understand it. Creepy boy and your forest friends - out. Get out! Out! She didn't look like much of a demon to me. Yeah: no crows, no bees... If the talisman didn't glow, that means she's not a threat, doesn't it? Maybe the talisman works differently in this universe. Maybe it's broken. Maybe she's just Phoebe's sister, like she says. She came back the same time we did. No way that's a coincidence. Just let it go, Felix. We've got a party to get to. Sam! Felix! Welcome back! Move it, nerd! Hey, the footy team hasn't been the same without you, bro. I thought you hated parties. Loathe and detest them, but I figured you'd be here. We don't have to stay. What, and leave your fan club? Felix, are you and Jake friends now? Hi. Hi. Does this mean anything to you? It's a necklace. Don't you recognise it? Don't think so. Someone very cool told me to give it to you. Who? I can't tell you that. OK. Wait - it's me. I want you to have it. Why? Because... Because I think you're smart and pretty and you don't give yourself enough credit. Thanks for the pep talk. Bye. Cool party. This is the worst party of my life. Hey, you're here! It's your welcome-home. And you wanted to talk, right? Listen, Sam... Mia. Thanks, Lachlan. Oh, sorry. I didn't get one for you. That's OK. I'll just take this one. While you were gone, I... Got pretty close with Lachlan... Obviously. We're just friends. Uh-huh. I've been meaning to ask you if you want to go to a movie this week. We go to the movies every week. I know. But this would be different. How? Well... I'd pay. You mean, a date? No. Oh. Yes, you idiot! Really? It's only taken you 15 years to ask me. It's not the same Ellen. I know, but if only she could see what I can do. Forget it, Andy. In this universe, she's not into you. (Everyone laughs) Are you crazy? What are you doing? Everyone could have seen that. Haven't you been listening to a single thing I've been saying? You knew I liked Ellen! Hey, Andy, give it back! What's going on? Andy took my bag with the Book of Shadows and the talisman. We have to go after him. Dude, this is our party. It's getting closer. Order must be restored, remember? WOMAN: They don't listen. Who said that? They don't see you. But you can be strong. You can control everything. Use the magic. You have the power. Quickly! Say the spell. Andy! Andy, where are you? Andy! Andy? Andy, what are you doing? I can do this! Do what? You'll see. What? Elements, obey me. Water, heed my call. Andy, stop. You don't know... Look! Rise and fall. The restoring demon! Become the power, the source of all. Andy! Listen to me! Andy, stop! Andy, no! Andy, look at me! Elements, obey me. Water, heed my call. Don't do it! Surround, unleash, rise and fall. Become the power, the source of all. Andy, stop this! Look at what you're doing! I have the power now. I can control the magic. Andy, watch out! Andy! Andy, look out! Andy, no! Andy!... All : Andy! Andy, can you hear me? He got sucked into the sky, doofus! He could be anywhere. What about an unmaking spell? Maybe a reversal spell. We need something to sacrifice. Something Andy really cares about. (Screams) Have you seen Sam? And I'd know where your boyfriend is because? Because my boyfriend has a man crush on your boyfriend. Felix is not my boyfriend. I want to help. Why would we trust you? You tried to destroy us. I'm not a threat. Element of water, find your power, take your form. Whoa! All : Andy!
