 (music playing) 
 (computer alert beeping) 
 Ab, Ab, Ab-- No joke, today is the day we become Abbi and Ilana, the boss bitches we are in our minds. 
 Are you with me? 
 Yeah, I'm with you, awesome. 
 Are you-- Is that the whole thing? 
 Obviously I have a plan. 
 Tonight we are going to see a secret pop-up Lil Wayne concert at Bowery Ballroom. 
 I can't, I'm so broke. 
 No excuses, girl. 
 I'm getting big ol' balls of mozzarella today. 
 Chea-- Get it! 
 Chea-- Harder. You're gonna have to speak in English for me. I am getting my paycheck today and I can spot you, bitch! I wish that I could, but I am so close to finishing season one of "Damages," and I made, this, like, amazing cashew stir-fry for the week, so I'm actually pretty booked. Stir-fry? Can I talk to the Abbi who stole a van? Ab, you're so stuck in your little routine. I bet you schedule when you jack off. Schedule when I ja-- (exhales deeply) Oh, my God. Is that Lincoln? Yep. Is he inside of you? Yep. I'm just keeping him warm. All right-- Let's just set some ground rules here for everybody involved. I don't want to see you have s*x. Let's try and avoid that. Lincoln, you seem well. Thank you-- I've been doing this no-bread diet and it's pretty good. It's been working. All right-- I'm gonna head out, then. Peace, bye. That was hot-- That was cool. That was like a threesome, in a way. Uh, Ilana, what are we doing? Are we just having s*x, hooking up? Are we dating? What is this? This is purely physical. Why does this always happen to me? ♪ Four and three and two and one-one ♪ Abbi : Climb-- Push it! Come on! Let's make some magic here. Let's climb it. Turn up that resistance-- Come on. Let's do this. Yes, climb. Yo, Abbi. Hey. Got something for you. Okay. Big ol' clogged toilet in the girls' room. It's pretty bad. You'll know it when you see it. Thanks for the heads-up, Tre. No problem-- Just do me a favor. Try not to make eye contact with any members when you're holding the plunger. Really bums 'em out. Well, I mean, what if someone just, like, walks-- man : Underwater massage? Yes-- Yes, that sounds intense. Great job, killing it. Who's got more deals? Who else has a deal for me? Ooh, Nicole, what's your deal. I'm kind of obsessed with these D-I-Y vajazzling seminars and I feel like they'd be a really great fit for us. That is what I'm talking about. Do you guys smell that? Come on, sniff the air. Oh, what's that odor? I think it's the scent of a deal. Who's got more deals for me? Ooh, in the back, Ilana. Dope sweatshirt-- What is your deal? I've been kind of obsessed with getting paid and I was wondering if that's happening today so we could all be paid. Checks, unfortunately, delayed 'til Friday. Bummer. F-M-L, right? Speaking of F-M-L, went on a third date with that girl from Match.com, to keep you guys updated, third time, went for the kiss, third time rejected, but I'll try-- I'll get it. Let's get back to our desks. Deals don't make themselves. Ilana : Bonjour, petit Wayne. I am a genius. man : Not so much-- Right, buddy? That's the look of a dealer right there. If I was in Las Vegas, I'd assume you could move the table limit. That's how much of a dealer you are. Ilana. Ooh. Come on, this is not work. Oh... Okay, I'll take lunch. Please... Come back today. Oh! Ilana. Don't Black Swan me like that, dude. Okay, what are you even doing here? Nothing-- Just strolling through the neighborhood and wanted to see my number one. Oh, really? Okay, listen-- I really think that you deserve-- Hey. Sorry, I forgot about the line. I'll see you in the second-class citizen area. It's called the non-member pen and you know that. Ew-- Listen to yourself. I think you deserve like an Abbi Bueller's day off. I can't just leave work in the middle of the day. Yes, you can-- You just lie and leave. All they let you do is fold towels, anyway. No, they don't. They let me do a lot more than that. I wash the towels and then I dry the towels. Great... to see you. Good friend? Uh-huh, yeah, she's great. Also, any day now, a trainer's gonna be absent and guess who they're gonna invite to instruct a class. I would love for that to happen, but it's just not. They don't respect you. Oh, thank God, Abbi, there you are. Tre. Thank God. We really need you, buddy. Yes, I'm prepared. So... We got another pube situation in the women's locker room. Yeah-- Somebody really went to town in the second shower stall. And if you need the snake, it's probably wherever you last left it. I know where it is, so. You know, you should just label it "Abbi's snake," you're so good with it. I don't know if I wanna... Seriously. Okay, Abbi, come on. Can I get a little more positivity from you, please? I'll clean it. You can be positive, right? I know you can be positive. Yeah, you know what? You know, I can be positive, because I actually might be positive. I'm dealing with some pretty scary test results that are at a clinic right now and I have to get 'em, but I'm at work. I mean, I might be positive in a blood situation, so... Is it herpes? No, it's not. Genital warts. No. Oh, my God. Abbi. Is it the big one? It could be the big one. Abbi, you gotta get those results? I gotta get the pubes. Don't worry about the pubes, Abbi. Get your results. Blaise, there you are-- Would you get to class? Abbi. Let me know if you have AIDS. You'll be the first one that I tell. When I find out. Okay, so tickets are 50 each. Obviously, we need an eighth. Ok. Plus drinks, that's like 200 bucks total. And since Todd wouldn't give me my paycheck. Girl! You took all of his office supplies. Listen, what I do at my place of work is none of your godamn business, okay? Okay, I think you really need to be fired really soon. I know. ("What a Wonderful World" playing) Oh, I love this song. Ugh-- This is a slave song. It's not a slave song. Yes, it is. It's widely known by the black community that "What a Wonderful World" is, like, a slave song. Right, right, right, I totally forgot that you're, like, the voice of the whole black community. It's a thing-- Google it. It's in a Fugees song. Wyclef's like, "And I think to myself." He's like angry about it. I feel like all we ever talk about is black people and slaver...y... Hi. I would like to return these items. I once owned them personally, but I have no use for them now, so. Your total comes to $135.67. Yes! Shit-- Yes! Oh. You know, we'd love to get that in liquid cash. Yeah. Okay. Okay, what about my fishbowl of change? There's got to be, like, 30 or 40 bucks in there? Can you leave? Yeah, we're gonna-- We're ending the convo. ♪♪ man : Justin, Justin, there's a sniper there-- Oh! I just told you that! Oh, my God. Hey, guys. Hey. Yo. What gun are you using? Ah, you got the variable zoom on that. Oh, I'll have to check that out. Sorry, Ilana, all that cheese you wanted is gone. It looks like somebody ate it all. That sucks. Cheese is dope. Uh-oh, UAV inbound courtesy of yours truly. (with funny voice) You're welcome. Hey, Bevers. So I noticed that you ate all of my cheese again. Could you not do that? Or maybe get more? I'm sorry. I actually didn't realize it was your cheese. I labeled it pretty clearly. Mm-hmm, I see. Maybe in the future if you do that, put it on, like-- Like, all six sides of the cheese brick. Yeah. Well, maybe you can just restock it, then? I can put on some sweats and run out if you want me to. Yeah, okay. Or, you know... (laughing) I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to my roommate! You're not my roommate. You're my roommate's boyfriend. What? Oh, also, the toilet's clogged. My bad. You know, I think I'm lactose intolerant. Good thing you ate all that cheese. You know that there's a plunger in the bathroom. It's right next to the toilet. It's like, right within... I do know that, but I also know that you told me not to touch your stuff in the bathroom. Right. That's my mistake. Yeah. You disgust me. What? Oh-- Sergeant first class! I just ranked up, Abbi! Yes, I placed the Jewess ad. Both of us are over 18, yeah. Under 18, I said. We're both under 18, we're young teens-- Hello? Goddammit. Okay. ♪ At the bottom of the ocean ♪♪ Hey, somebody left a dank turd-- Oh, my God. You still have your performance bib, right? Yeah, duh. This is gonna make a dent in the Weezy fund, dude. Huge dent. man : Did you call me? No, Matt, I didn't call you! It's like, why would we call you? It's like he's constantly in my face. It kills me that he lives here and doesn't pay a cent. I feel dirtier when I leave the shower because his hair-- his hair is, like, all over my body. It's like I have to see your dick in your shorts. God! You know, one side is always gonna be hamstrung by the other side's Congress, you know? It just doesn't matter-- We're done. We're done as a country. Matt, did you just call me? (clattering) (in slow motion) Jeremy.

Anyway, just so you know, we need toilet paper. Oh, we need it-- We do? Well, if you don't mind, I mean, since you're going out anyway. Is there anything else that I can get you, maybe, when I'm out? Well, I wasn't gonna ask but I have been hankering for something sweet. Like a hot cookie? Soft but not moist. Or, surprise me! Kill you in your sleep, how's that for a surprise? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I got a special delivery for you, Ilana. Thank you so much, I-- I brought your beautiful thing, too. Oh. Jaime, you are the best roommate and best friend I've ever had. When you're ready to become a citizen, my legs are wide open. I don't think that's how it works, but thank you. Jaime, Himmels, Hymes-- How are you? Good. Are you stoned right now? Yeah. Good, so regarding the pot... Mmm-hmm. we can get you that 60 bucks ASAP. Okay. Or... this office warehouse giftcard has $135 on it. Whoa. I know, it's like, what do they even have there? Only any office supply known to man. I mean, I think they even have food now. Oh, yeah-- No, I'll take it. There's like, lamps. Please-- Tons of stuff. Give it to me. Yeah-- That's good... Trade? I'll take it. Yes. Yes. (warming up voice) Bah, bah, black sheep. Dude, the card worked. Yes. Now we only need 140. Easy, we're done. We're doing it, dude, we're getting there. Is that Lincoln? (straw squeaks) Why is he doing this to me before curtain? (warming up voice) Bah, bah, black sheep. Lincoln, why are you here? No offense. I saw your tweet, so I wanted to stop by, but I wanted to respect your space. That's why I'm hanging back. That's cool. I respect you respecting me. Yeah? I'm gonna respect your dick later. (tapping) Yeah! Weekdays are tough. It's early for lunch. They just need time to find the audience, you know? The first season of "Seinfeld," not that many people saw that show, but it got time to grow. Yeah. Oh, we got a fan. We got a fan, hey, hey, hey. Me and Ilana, we really don't like to use labels. We try to be more progressive. We have a real connection. Oh, she's break dancing, that's cool. All right, let's pick it up. Who teaches the bucket drummers? I never seen a bucket drummer class listed anywhere. (clapping, cheering) She should be giving us, like, 25%. We can't do this anymore. This is insane. We're like-- Where'd the music go? crowd : Boo! Are you kidding me? No-- She wouldn't even have anything to dance to if it wasn't for us! man : You suck! What-- Shut up! All right. You come out and you try to do some good. Stop! Grow up! I just don't understand why she took the fishbowl. I would have given it to her. Homeless people need supplies, I don't know. I know. And we need 90 bucks in two hours and you need to get stoned, I need your... 90 bucks-- Okay. crazy brain, man.

Thank you for this opportunity. We'll see you in 30 minutes or less. Bye-bye, sir. What? Okay, I had a backup plan on the low this whole time and it's coming up, it's happening.
