 INT. COUNTRY BAR - NIGHT 
 (MUSIC PLAYS B.G.) 
 VANESSA: I hate happy hour. Make a hole, people! 
 CAROL: So at least two of your Marine buddies have disappeared and you think you could be next? Why? 
 ATLAS: Do you have to write down everything I say? 
 CAROL: I'm a reporter. It's what I do. 
 ATLAS: I thought this was supposed to be a date. Look, if it turns out to be true, and if I'm next, you could end up dead, too. 
 CAROL: And if my husband finds out about us, I'll be dead anyway. 
 ATLAS: I didn't order a drink. 
 CAROL: Is your name Atlas? 
 ATLAS: Yeah. 
 CAROL: Then I guess you've got a secret admirer. Enjoy. 
 ATLAS: We should have gone to a hotel. 
 CAROL: It's probably somebody you know. 
 ATLAS: That's what I'm afraid of. I'll call you.

 "MISSING"(SFX: KEYBOARDING B.G.) 
 KATE: I thought you couldn't type. 
 TONY: I've decided to improve myself. 
 KATE: Well, in that case, you might want to lose that shirt. It went out of style three years ago. 
 TONY: This from a girl who keeps a pukka shell necklace in her purse. 
 KATE: My grandma gave me those. Wait, you looked in my purse? 
 TONY: Sorry, did I say that aloud? 
 KATE: Tony, you are so lucky you didn't have sisters growing up. 
 TONY: Why is that? 
 KATE: Because you'd never have reached puberty. Of course one could argue you still haven't reached it. Very professional. 
 TONY: It's my lunch break. 
 KATE: It's nine-thirty in the morning. 
 TONY: I'm on Greenwich Mean Time. 
 KATE: You're going to be on unemployment if Gibbs catches you doing that. 
 GIBBS: Catch him doing what, Kate? 
 KATE: Nothing. Um... I was just giving Tony here some fashion advice. 
 GIBBS: On what? 
 KATE: Oh, he was just thinking about... getting both of his ears pierced. 
 GIBBS: That right, DiNozzo? 
 TONY: I think Kate misunderstood, boss. What I was really talking about was elongating the lobe. 
 GIBBS: Hey, if you want to look like a gay pirate, that's your call. 
 KATE: I thought you were going to an anti-terrorism conference today, Gibbs? 
 GIBBS: Change in plan. A Marine Gunnery Sergeant didn't show up for duty this week. 
 TONY: Since when do we track down U-A Marines? 
 GIBBS: Since he's one of a handful of people who knows how to arm small yield nuclear weapons. His S.R.B. I've got forty-five minutes to memorize it. And Tony? If that game's still on your computer in the morning, I'll pierce your ears myself. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. COUNTRY BAR - DAY 
 GIBBS: How long has the pick-up truck been in your lot? 
 VANESSA: Since Friday night. 
 KATE: Five days? Why wait so long to report it? 
 VANESSA: Figured somebody got lucky, went home in a different car. Happens around here a lot. 
 TONY: I'll bet it does. The guy we're looking for is a Marine. 
 VANESSA: Yeah. We get a lot of those around here. Me? I like a man with hair. 
 KATE: What about him? His name is Gunnery Sergeant Bill Atlas. 
 VANESSA: Yeah, sure. He was here Friday night. Is he all right? 
 KATE: That's what we're trying to find out. 
 GIBBS: Was he here with anyone? 
 VANESSA: Yeah. Red head. Good looking. I think they're having an affair. 
 GIBBS: What makes you say that? 
 VANESSA: Because he went out the back and she went out the front. 
 GIBBS: Kate you stay here. Get a description of the woman and check out his pick up truck. DiNozzo, you're with me. 
 TONY: Uh... if you remember anything else, don't hesitate to call. 
 VANESSA: What if I don't remember anything else? 
 TONY: Don't hesitate to call. 
 VANESSA: You got it, cowboy. 
 (TONY WALKS O.S.) 
 VANESSA: He is cute. What's his deal? 
 KATE: Tony? 
 VANESSA: Uh-huh. 
 KATE: He's a nice guy. 
 VANESSA: You two aren't... uh... you know. 
 KATE: Oh. No. No. No way. We're just co-workers. 
 VANESSA: Cool. I'm a sucker for a man in a checkered shirt. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
 TONY: Any chance Atlas decided to walk away from it all? 
 GIBBS: The man could retire in a year. Nobody walks away from a twenty year pension. 
 TONY: Then it doesn't look good for him. Statistically, most bodies turn up dead after four days. 
 GIBBS: Four days, huh? Really, DiNozzo. Thanks for sharing. 
 TONY: Well, I know you know. I'm just saying-- 
 GIBBS: I'm not big on statistics. 
 TONY: I kind of figured. I mean, since most marriages end in divorce, and you've been married three.... Maybe it's like the waitress said, he got lucky. 
 GIBBS: Spread out. I want to know why Atlas never got back to his truck. 
 (INTERCUT SERIES OF FLASH PHOTOS) 
 GIBBS: DiNozzo! Hey! Get your butt over here. 
 VANESSA: Is he always like that? 
 TONY: Uh, only when he's awake. 
 GIBBS: Atlas was forced to leave here. No Marine would leave a Zippo like this behind. 
 TONY: I've got an unsmoked cigarette here. 
 GIBBS: Bag it. 
 TONY: What're you thinking, Boss? 
 GIBBS: Wherever Atlas is... his luck is running out. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SEWER - DAY 
 (SFX: WATER DRIPS B.G.) 
 ATLAS: You don't have to do this. Just tell me... just tell me what you want. What about some food? Can I at least have some food? (SHOUTS) Say something! Who the hell are you?! 
 (ATLAS SHOUTS AND PULLS ON THE CHAIN) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. BAR - DAY 
 KATE: I've got a rough sketch of the woman Atlas was having an affair with. It's not much to go on, but if he was having an affair with a married woman then we have a motive for someone wanting him to vanish. 
 GIBBS: Pull his phone records. See if we can't match that face with a phone number. 
 KATE: I already made a request for the subpoena. 
 GIBBS: Oh, DiNozzo. He's about a step from vanishing himself. (SHOUTS) Hey! 
 TONY: Ciao, bella. 
 WOMAN: See you.(TONY WALKS TO GIBBS) 
 TONY: I got her name, boss. 
 GIBBS: Do I look like I care, DiNozzo? Let's go. 
 TONY: The woman with Atlas, her name's Carol Powers. I got the waitress to remember she paid using a credit card. She's a reporter for The Post. I can have her in our office in an hour if you're interested. 
 GIBBS: Good job. 
 TONY: I'm sorry, boss. Did you say something? Did he just say something, Kate? 
 KATE: Don't push it, Tony. 
 TONY: Pushing it is what I love about this job. That and the beautiful girls. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: I appreciate you coming down here on such short notice, Mrs. Powers. Please, have a seat. 
 CAROL: Can the polite act, Agent Todd. What exactly do you want from me? 
 KATE: Information. 
 CAROL: About what? 
 KATE: Your relationship with Gunnery Sergeant Atlas. 
 CAROL: Who? 
 KATE: Look familiar? 
 CAROL: Ah yeah. Maybe. I'm a reporter. I've interviewed dozens of Marines. 
 KATE: The thing is, this Marine disappeared five days ago. My job is to get him back. 
 CAROL: What's that got to do with me? 
 KATE: Does your husband know you're having an affair? 
 CAROL: Excuse me? 
 KATE: I'll take that as a no. 
 CAROL: I think we're done here. 
 TONY: Here's the phone number you requested, Agent Todd. 
 KATE: Should I try your husband at home or work this time of day, Mrs. Powers? 
 (SFX: TELEPHONE BEEP TONES) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
 CAROL: I don't know what happened to Atlas, okay? But my husband had nothing to do with this. 
 GIBBS: So he knew you were having an affair? 
 CAROL: No! Derek was on assignment... 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
 CAROL: ... in Italy, and he just got back last night. You can check with The Post, they'll vouch for him. 
 GIBBS: Oh, I will. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) How did you meet Atlas? 
 CAROL: (V.O.) Uh... at a bar three weeks ago. He said he had a... 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERVIEW ROOM 
 CAROL: ... story that I might be interested in. 
 GIBBS: Do you sleep with anyone who offers you a story, or is that one of the fringe benefits? 
 CAROL: This is a nightmare. 
 GIBBS: What story did Atlas tell you? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
 CAROL: He thought someone might have killed his friends and that he could be next. 
 GIBBS: (V.O.) Did he say why? 
 CAROL: He wouldn't tell me. I thought it might be connected with his work in Iraq. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
 CAROL: Some kind of cover up. 
 GIBBS: It says here you write articles on home improvement. 
 CAROL: Gardens mostly. I just... I thought if I could get a story like this, I could... 
 GIBBS: Oh, yeah. I understand. Most reporters... they'd absolutely kill for a scoop like this. 
 CAROL: He tried to warn me. He told me that if he talked, something like this might happen. 
 GIBBS: Something like what? 
 CAROL: Someone in his unit would kill him. 
 (MUSIC UP AND OUT) 
 FADE IN: 
 INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: I think she's telling the truth. 
 TONY: The question is was Gunnery Sergeant Atlas? Some guys will say anything to get a woman into bed. 
 KATE: Well, she's a reporter. I doubt she'd fall for something like that. 
 TONY: You're kidding, right? 
 KATE: What do you mean? 
 TONY: All men lie to some degree, Kate. It's expected of them. 
 KATE: All right, well don't confuse your world with reality, Tony. 
 TONY: It's like when a woman asks a man to guess her age. Have you ever done that? Do you honestly still believe you still look twenty five? 
 KATE: Not anymore. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
 CAROL: I've never done anything like this before. I only wanted a story.(GIBBS AND CAROL WALK TO SQUAD ROOM) 
 GIBBS: You got one. 
 CAROL: Is there any way, anything that I can do to keep my husband out of this? 
 GIBBS: Truth? Nope. 
 CAROL: You know, I could publish what Atlas told me. It wouldn't look so good for the Marine Corps. 
 (SFX: ELEVATOR DINGS/DOORS SLIDE OPEN) 
 GIBBS: I don't read The Post. Watch your step. 
 CAROL: Regardless of what you may think of me, Agent Gibbs, I truly hope that you find Bill and that he's still alive. 
 GIBBS: Me, too.(SFX: ELEVATOR DINGS/DOORS SLIDE CLOSED) 
 KATE: You were pretty tough on her in there. 
 GIBBS: Yes, she reminds me of my ex-wife. 
 TONY: Which one? 
 GIBBS: All of them. Did her husband's story check out? 
 TONY: He was in Italy, arrived at Reagan National last night at twenty one sixteen. Looks like a dead end. 
 KATE: Do you believe that story about a cover-up in Iraq, Gibbs? 
 GIBBS: I don't know. I'm more concerned about what's happening here. 
 KATE: Meaning? 
 GIBBS: Meaning Atlas was a twenty three thirty six. 
 TONY: Explosive Ordinance Disposal Technician. Guys can make or disarm anything from a grenade to a... backpack nuke. 
 GIBBS: If someone's kidnapping E-O-D personnel, I want to know why. 
 KATE: Terrorists? 
 GIBBS: Is anyone missing from Atlas' unit? 
 KATE: They're all accounted for. But I might have something else here. A new C.O. checked into his command last month, Major Joe Sacco. His record's clean except for a non-punitive letter of punishment from when he was a First Lieutenant. 
 GIBBS: For what? 
 KATE: He got into a fight with a couple of enlisted men in ninety two. Atlas was one of them. 
 (SFX: PHONE RINGS) 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, Gibbs. We're on our way. (TO KATE) Abby's found something. 
 KATE: Do you think Atlas is still alive? 
 TONY: No ransom note? Been missing over five days? I'd say the odds were against him. 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SEWER - DAY 
 (SFX: ATLAS DRINKS FROM THE GROUND) 
 ATLAS: What are you doing, you sick b*st*rd? Do you think you can make me talk? 
 (ATLAS SHOUTS) 
 ATLAS: Who are you? What is the name of your organization?

 CUT TO: 
 INT. NCIS LAB - DAY 
 ABBY: Hi, guys! 
 GIBBS TONY AND KATE: (IN UNISON) Hey, Abby. 
 ABBY: I think I found out how they found your missing Marine. 
 KATE: From one cigarette butt? 
 ABBY: Well, I was kind of bored, so I thought it'd be fun to run every single test I could think of. I was almost to a rape kit when... I mentioned I was a little bored earlier, right? 
 GIBBS: Yeah, we noticed, Abs. 
 TONY: What the hell is that? 
 ABBY: I'm building a model of Gallipoli. See, these guys over here... 
 GIBBS: Why? 
 ABBY: Because I like the way it sounds. Gallipoli. Gallipoli. Gallipoli. Gallipoli. Gallipoli. Gallipoli. 
 GIBBS: Stop. 
 TONY: Is this one a Turk or an Anzac. 
 ABBY: Um, actually he's uh... 
 GIBBS: What'd you find? 
 ABBY: Atlas' DNA was on the cigarette. So most likely it's his. 
 TONY: That's it?! 
 ABBY: I wasn't finished yet, Tony. I also found high concentrations of ephedrine, dihydrocodeine and caffeine. Sound familiar? 
 TONY AND GIBBS: Bron. 
 ABBY: And from the way it was concentrated, it looks like he ingested enough to knock out a racehorse. 
 KATE: Bron? 
 TONY: It's a mixture of speed and codeine. It's illegal here by available over the counter in the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan. 
 KATE: Okinawa? That was Major Sacco's last duty station. 
 GIBBS: Check out the ride. We're going to Quantico. 
 TONY: Oh, boss. Rush hour. Real bad idea to get on the road about now. I'll be outside. 
 KATE: Good job, Abby. 
 ABBY: Thanks, Kate. 
 GIBBS: Hey Abby, still bored? 
 ABBY: Well yeah, maybe a little. 
 GIBBS: I think I have a more constructive way for you to spend your time. I need some help. 
 ABBY: Okay. 
 GIBBS: By the way, Gallipoli was an amphibious operation. 
 ABBY: Oh... hmm. Well, it's on Styrofoam so it'll float. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. FREEWAY - DAY 
 (SFX: CARS HONK B.G.) 
 TONY: (V.O.) Rush hour. (ON CAMERA) It's kind of a misnomer if you ask me. 
 GIBBS: I didn't. 
 TONY: I mean, it's not like anybody's really rushing anywhere, and it always takes more than an hour. They should call it like-- 
 GIBBS: Shut up and sit there before I shoot you hour. 
 TONY: I was thinking of something a little shorter. 
 (SFX: TONY SLURPS THE DRINK) 
 (GIBBS THROWS THE CUP OUT THE WINDOW) 
 TONY: That's littering. 
 GIBBS: Fine me. 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) No, I'm still here. Thanks, Corporal. (TO GIBBS) Major Sacco is in the field right now. 
 GIBBS: Doing what? 
 KATE: According to his office, disarming a bomb. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY 
 JACKSON: We've got five minutes here. Looks like closed circuit. 
 DAVIS: Five minutes I can disarm a nuke sub. Checking for secondary initiators. We are clear. Thank you, Sir. Watch and learn, my friend. Most people prefer the blue wire. Me? I'm partial to-- 
 (SFX: BEEP TONE) 
 JACKSON: What the hell did you just do? 
 DAVIS: Nothing. I didn't touch nothing. 
 (SFX: RAPID BEEP TONES) 
 (SFX: HUGE EXPLOSION) 
 SACCO: Way to go, MacGyver. If that were real we'd be washing you off the streets of Baghdad right now. Never assume that timer is accurate. The bad guys watch movies, too. 
 JACKSON: Yes, Sir. 
 GIBBS: Major Sacco! Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS. We need to talk. 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RANGE - DAY 
 SACCO: It wouldn't surprise me if Atlas showed up tomorrow still hung over. 
 TONY: He pulled a disappearing act before? 
 SACCO: Never this long, but he's had some alcohol related problems in the past. 
 GIBBS: You've got a missing Marine, Major. You don't seem too concerned about it. 
 SACCO: My only concern right now is getting my men ready to deploy to Iraq. 
 GIBBS: What about the Gunny? Is he deployable? 
 SACCO: Unfortunately. I've served with Atlas before. In my opinion, we're better off without him. 
 GIBBS: Yeah? Why's that? 
 SACCO: He's a marginal Marine. 
 KATE: Seems like the two of you had some person problems, Major. 
 SACCO: You could say that, Agent Todd. 
 GIBBS: Tell me about them. 
 SACCO: If you're interested, you can read about it in my record book. 
 GIBBS: I have. You two got in a fist fight in ninety two. About what? 
 SACCO: Nothing. A couple of my men got drunk one night. Atlas took a swing at me. I overreacted. 
 DAVIS: Sir, demo's waiting. They're waiting on your command. 
 SACCO: Roger that, Corporal. (TO GIBBS) We only have this range for another hour. When you find Atlas, let him know that I have a charge sheet waiting for him. 
 (SACCO WALKS O.S.) 
 KATE: He's hiding something. 
 GIBBS: Oh, yeah. 
 TONY: The question is what? 
 GIBBS: You two might want to cover your-- 
 (SFX: HUGE EXPLOSION) 
 GIBBS: ...ears. 
 (TONY LAUGHS) 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. CAR - MOVING 
 (SFX: CAR DRIVES OVER DIRT ROAD) 
 TONY: Boss, is there a reason why you only take these back roads?(SFX: CAR ENGINE B.G.) 
 KATE: Or do you just hate us? 
 GIBBS: I hate traffic more. 
 TONY: I think I'm going to puke. 
 GIBBS: Roll down the window! 
 TONY: Oh...(SFX: PHONE RINGS) 
 GIBBS: Here, answer this! 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) Hey Gibbs, it's me, Abby. I've got... 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) It's Kate!(BEGIN TELEPHONE INTERCUTS) 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Hey, Kate. Where's the boss man? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) He's driving! We should be back soon. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Oh, is he taking you on one of his special shortcuts? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) If that's what you want to call it! 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: (V.O./FILTERED) What's up?! 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Well, Gibbs asked me to do some background on Atlas and Sacco, and... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) ...I found something interesting. 
 KATE: (INTO PHONE) You're going to have to speak up! Gibbs is apparently trying to kill us! 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) Three other Marines have gone missing from E.O.D. units in the last eight years. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 GIBBS: What's she saying? 
 KATE: (SHOUTS) Three Marines have gone missing from E.O.D units. 
 GIBBS: Why didn't we hear that? 
 KATE: (SHOUTS/INTO PHONE) Why didn't we hear about it? 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) They're carried as deserters by the Marine Corps rolls after thirty days. 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 KATE: They're considered deserters. 
 ABBY: (V.O./FILTERED) They all have two things in common... 
 (SCENE CUT) 
 ABBY: (INTO PHONE) ...with Atlas. They all served together in the Philippines in nineteen ninety two. And their platoon commander was Joe Sacco.

 FADE IN: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: Corporal Tom O'Conner, reported U-A on August second, ninety six. Sergeant Rick Hall... reported U-A March eleventh, ninety eight. Staff Sergeant John Mohs, reported U-A on December tenth, two thousand. And now Gunnery Sergeant Atlas, five days ago. All four served in the Philippines in ninety two with Joe Sacco, and all four subsequently disappeared without a trace. 
 TONY: So why is it no one else picked up on this before us? 
 KATE: Well, we wouldn't have picked up on it if Abby wasn't bored. These men were considered deserters. Nobody ever connected them until we did today. 
 TONY: So let's pick up Sacco, find out what's going on. 
 GIBBS: Not yet. 
 KATE: Well, I think he's right, Gibbs. I mean, we could be dealing with a potential serial killer here. 
 GIBBS: What if it's not Sacco? 
 KATE: Well, if it's not him, then he's probably the next one on the missing list. 
 GIBBS: I want everything there is on that E-O-D team from ninety two. Kate, get with Abby and start where she left off. Tony, you concentrate on Sacco. I want everything from his birth until right now. 
 TONY: You remember the good old days, Kate? 
 KATE: What good old days? 
 TONY: When Gibbs would confide in us and treat us like peers. 
 KATE: No. 
 TONY: Good, I thought I was the only one.

 ABBY: Hey, Kate. I was just about to call you. 
 KATE: Uh... Gibbs wants uh... wants me to ... 
 ABBY: They're boats. I was recently informed that Gallipoli was an amphib operation. 
 KATE: Okay. So what can you tell me about Sacco's old unit? 
 ABBY: Um... in ninety two we were closing the base in the Philippines. And Sacco's E-O-D team was in charge of clearing out the ammunition storage dumps. 
 KATE: Do we know how big his unit was? 
 ABBY: We could ask him, but in my experience, most men lie about that point. There were six of them. 
 KATE: Okay, so if there were six, that means... 
 ABBY: There's one of them still running around out there. Which is why I was going to call you. Meet Corporal Mark Cohen. 
 KATE: Where's he stationed? 
 ABBY: He's not. He got the big chicken dinner back in ninety nine. 
 KATE: What, Abby? 
 ABBY: Bad conduct discharge. The Marine Corps doesn't keep track after they separate. 
 KATE: So what was the chicken dinner for? 
 ABBY: Assaulting his company commander. 
 KATE: I think we just found our second suspect. 
 ABBY: Not quite. I've been running his social and... I haven't been able to find him anywhere. 
 KATE: Oh. 
 ABBY: I always feel like Mister Rogers when I leave here. 
 KATE: Where are you going? 
 ABBY: Gibbs didn't tell you? 
 KATE: Tell me what? 
 ABBY: I have a party to go to. 
 KATE: How did you get him to agree to that? 
 ABBY: I asked him. So if you need me, call me. You just umm... disregard any sounds that you may or may not hear in the background.

 GIBBS: Find Kate. I want a full briefing in twenty minutes. 
 TONY: You got it. Kate? (SHOUTS) Kate! 
 KATE: (GASPS) What?! 
 TONY: Time to wake up. 
 KATE: Mm... I feel like hell.

 GIBBS: Kate, what have we got? 
 KATE: Oh, how can you eat that stuff? It's seven thirty in the morning. 
 GIBBS: (MUFFLED) Practice. It's good. You want some? 
 KATE: I'll pass. We're still trying to track down former Corporal Cohen. He left a trail 'till two thousand two, then nothing. 
 GIBBS: Tony? 
 TONY: (MUFFLED) Sacco was stationed in the same vicinity with all four Marines who went U-A. That's got to be more than a coincidence. 
 GIBBS: What have you learned about the fight in his record book? 
 TONY: Well, I called the Colonel he was working for in ninety two. He didn't remember much. It could have been because it was two a.m. when I called him, but you never know. 
 GIBBS: (MUFFLED) What'd he say? 
 TONY: He thinks it was over a woman. 
 GIBBS: An all nighter and this is all I get? 
 KATE: We're recreating a twelve year history, Gibbs. What did you expect? 
 GIBBS: More. 
 KATE: Okay, then bring Major Sacco in for questioning. 
 GIBBS: (MUFFLED) Give me something I can nail him with and I will. 
 TONY: I'll get it for you. 
 GIBBS: Yeah. How? 
 TONY: Let me shadow him for a couple of days. If he's got a screw loose, I'll know it. He might lead us to Atlas. 
 GIBBS: All right. 
 TONY: Listen, boss, I'm telling you... it beats sitting around here doing nothing. I'm out there trying to find him. 
 KATE: (OVERLAP) He said okay, Tony. 
 TONY: Oh. I'm telling you, that explosion really messed my hearing up. 
 KATE: I'll go with him. 
 GIBBS: No. No. I need you here. DiNozzo, you call in every hour. If you forget one time - call in late - don't bother coming back. 
 KATE: Look, just don't take any chances, okay? I mean, if we're right about Sacco, he's got more than a screw loose. 
 TONY: Here I was thinking you didn't care. 
 KATE: It has nothing to do with caring. If anything happens to you, I'm going to be stuck working here with Gibbs alone. 
 TONY: Oh, he's not that bad. A little grumpy sometimes... 
 GIBBS: (SHOUTS) Hey, DiNozzo! Are you still here?!

 (MUSIC PLAYS B.G.) 
 ABBY: So I found Cohen. I think we can cross him off the suspect list. He's dead. 
 KATE: How? 
 ABBY: They found him last year in the sewer system in Old Town Alexandria chained to a wall. Not a pretty picture. It looks like he was down there for a while. The locals are sending us copies of the crime scene report, autopsy, and evidence of the scene. It's a cold case. 
 GIBBS: Not anymore. 
 ABBY: Hey, where's Tony? 
 GIBBS: I've got him tailing Sacco. 
 ABBY: Alone? 
 GIBBS: He does his best work when there's not an audience around. 
 ABBY: I've got a weird feeling. 
 GIBBS: Abs, you always have a weird feeling. 
 ABBY: I know, but this one's different. 
 GIBBS: He can take care of himself. You let me know when those records show up. 
 (GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 ABBY: Got it. What do you think, Kate? 
 KATE: Well, I think you're just suffering from the effects of your party last night. 
 ABBY: All I drank was Red Bull. 
 KATE: How many? 
 ABBY: Eighteen.

 KATE: I've interviewed everyone in the area. No one saw Tony after he came out of the bar. You don't think he's... I don't either. 
 GIBBS: Sacco. 
 KATE: We've got people at his house, an A-P-B out on his vehicle. It's only a matter of time before we pick him up. 
 GIBBS: Yeah, well... time's the one thing we don't have. (INTO PHONE) Gibbs, for the Director.

 ATLAS: Only a week? It feels like... it feels like months. 
 TONY: Hey hey hey. Conserve your strength, okay? You're going to need it. 
 ATLAS: For what? 
 TONY: For when I get us out of here. 
 ATLAS: You got a plan? 
 TONY: Of course I do. I found you, didn't I? Granted, the escape part's still a little fuzzy, but I just got here. 
 ATLAS: Well, unless you're a blacksmith, we're pretty much screwed here. 
 TONY: You need to think positive, Gunny. 
 ATLAS: You're right. I'm positive I'm screwed. 
 TONY: A sense of humor's good. You're gonna need that. Okay, let's get this chain off your leg. 
 ATLAS: How? 
 TONY: Rule nine. 
 ATLAS: What? 
 TONY: Yeah, those rules they teach you guys in the Marine Corps. 
 ATLAS: What rules? 
 TONY: Huh. I always suspected Gibbs was making that stuff up. Well, rule nine is uh... never go anywhere... without a knife. 
 ATLAS: Even if you get it off, how do we get out of the room? 
 TONY: Hey, one thing at a time, huh, Gunny? 
 CUT TO: 
 INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY 
 KATE: We're dealing with a serial killer who is methodical and patient. He spread his kills out over an eight year period. And if we go by Cohen's case, he's into making them suffer. But why did he go after Tony? 
 GIBBS: He saw something tonight, something Major Sacco doesn't want us to know about. 
 KATE: Then why didn't Tony tell us? 
 GIBBS: Because maybe he didn't think it was important at the time? 
 MCGEE: Have we heard anything from Agent DiNozzo yet? 
 GIBBS: McGee, you're late. Kate, bring him up to speed. 
 MCGEE: Uh... uh... where can I set up shop? 
 KATE: Take Tony's desk. 
 MCGEE: You don't think he'll mind? 
 KATE: I think Tony's got other things on his mind right now, McGee.

 ATLAS: I need to confess something. 
 TONY: Well, when we get out of here I'll find you a priest. 
 ATLAS: No. I deserve this. I belong here. You don't. 
 TONY: No one deserves this, Gunny. 
 ATLAS: It was an accident. He must have found out about it. 
 TONY: Found out what? 
 ATLAS: We killed four girls, Agent DiNozzo. And Major Sacco was in love with one of them. 
 MUSICAL BRIDGE TO: 
 INT. AUTOPSY LAB - NIGHT 
 DUCKY: I reviewed Corporal Cohen's autopsy results from two thousand two. His body tissue had high concentrations of insect venom, honey bees to be exact. 
 GIBBS: Did it kill him? 
 DUCKY: Unfortunately no. Our young friend starved to death. And judging by the fat and muscle tissue loss, it happened over a period of weeks if not months. 
 GIBBS: That's the first good news I've heard all day. 
 DUCKY: Huh? 
 GIBBS: It means there's a chance Tony and Atlas are still alive. 
 DUCKY: You'll find him, Jethro. 
 GIBBS: That a question or a statement, Duck? 
 (GIBBS WALKS O.S.) 
 DUCKY: A little bit of both, I'm afraid.

 INT. SEWER - NIGHT 
 (ACTION CONTINUES/TONY ATTEMPTS TO OPEN THE DOOR) 
 TONY: Damn! Tell me more about the girls. 
 ATLAS: The base was closing. We all had girlfriends out in the town. We didn't want to leave them. 
 TONY: So you decided to kill them? That makes sense. 
 ATLAS: They would have been better off if we had. Instead, we tried to smuggle them back to the States inside shipping containers. 
 TONY: You mailed your girlfriends home? 
 ATLAS: Shipped. But Lieutenant Sacco changed our orders at the last minute. He split us up and put us all on different ships. We all assumed that one of us was on the one with the girls. 
 TONY: Oh, my god...

 ATLAS: Everyone thought they stowed away themselves. But it was us. We killed them Agent DiNozzo.

 GIBBS: Major Sacco's? 
 ABBY: No. 
 MCGEE: It's not listed in any database. 
 GIBBS: Abs, you could have told me that on the phone. 
 ABBY: I know. But I did find a match. 
 MCGEE: We just don't have a name... yet. 
 KATE: A match from where? 
 ABBY: The reporter's credit card receipt from the bar. 
 KATE: She wasn't after a story. She was working with Sacco. 
 MCGEE: Well, that's one possibility. I recommend that we run a test-- 
 GIBBS: (INTO PHONE) Gibbs. Secure the area. We're on our way. (TO KATE) Manassas P.D. located Sacco's car. McGee, get me an arrest warrant on Carol Powers.
