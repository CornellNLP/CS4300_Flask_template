 Your folks are gonna throw me right off that ranch. 
  Relax, honey. 
  You're my wife now. 
  You're family. 
  You are a Ewing. 
  How in hell did she end up marrying him? 
  I brought her to a couple barbecues. 
  I didn't know they were getting on that well. 
  I don't know about you, but I won't stand for this. 
  We should have got hitched a long time ago. 
  - Maybe it's not too late. 
  - Oh, I don't know. 
  It stops right now, J. R. 
  Pamela's my wife, and you're gonna treat her with respect. 
  - Now, listen here, little brother - It was a dumb, stupid trick, J. R. ! 
  Bobby James Ewing, I don't believe you. 
  Well, now, this is a fine state of affairs. 
  Married less than 24 hours, and my new bride doubts my veracity. 
  - I do if you say you're not nervous. 
  - Well, I'm not nervous. 
  Except for maybe one or two little butterflies somewhere. 
  Your folks are gonna throw me right off that ranch. 
  Relax, honey. 
  You're my wife now. 
  You're family. 
  You are a Ewing. 
  And once that sinks in, they're gonna love you. 
  Before it sinks in is what worries me. 
  Relax, sweetheart. 
  Everything's gonna be fine. 
  - Lf you say so, Bobby. 
  - I say so. 
  Gonna be a cold day today, eh? 
  Not for everybody. 
  Fill it up with unleaded and check under the hood for me. 
  Then pull it over to the side. 
  We'll have breakfast. 
  I appreciate it. 
  Come on, sweetie. 
  You work for Jock Ewing personally, or Ewing Oil? 
  Ewing Oil Company. 
  How long did you work for Ewing Oil, Mr. Bradley? 
  Oh, about five years, Senator Barnes. 
  No, I'm not a senator. 
  The gentlemen on my left and right are senators. 
  I'm just a legal counsel. 
  I'm counsel for this committee. 
  I gotcha. 
  - Did you carry? 
  - J. R. , you want me to open the drapes? 
  - Daylight will make a glare on the TV. 
  - Go ahead, open them up. 
  Maybe the glare will blind that jackass. 
  I told you, my job was courier, not opener. 
  Those envelopes were sealed. 
  Did you ever have any reason to think that there was money in those envelopes? 
  I never had any reason to think about anything, except maybe traffic. 
  Were you ever told to be careful with the envelopes? 
  I wasn 't hired to be careless, so no one told me Had to tell me about it. 
  Seems like old Phil is handling Cliff Barnes just fine. 
  Old Phil will be spilling his guts by noontime. 
  I hope the old man ain't watching this. 
  Well, we have testimony that John Ewing Jr. 's office. 
  Good. 
  How about yourself? 
  Fine. 
  Yes, he's right here. 
  It seems he is watching. 
  Hello, Daddy. 
  - You watching this thing? 
  - Yes, sir. 
  I see a couple of familiar faces sitting there. 
  Them old boys are supposed to be on our side. 
  Why in the hell ain't they saying anything? 
  - I don't know. 
  - Where's Bobby? 
  - I don't know. 
  In New Orleans someplace. 
  - John get him back and send him down to Austin. 
  Tell him to spread around a few B's and collect some of our markers, hear? 
  Yes, sir. 
  - I don 't know. 
  - To pay Pearl? 
  Now, look, you're on to something that I know nothing about. 
  That's for sticking your nose where it don't belong. 
  Most men keep work in their briefcases. 
  This is work, honey. 
  I told you, I'm Ewing Oil's goodwill ambassador. 
  You got a whole satchel full of goodwill there. 
  Yeah. 
  Daddy calls them B's. 
  Booze, broads and booty. 
  That's what keeps the independent oil men independent. 
  I thought you had a hand in running the family business. 
  Well, I do, honey. 
  I got a hand in keeping the business running. 
  Same thing. 
  No, it's not. 
  Pammy, I like my job. 
  It's people, it's a good time. 
  And women. 
  Now, just because I got what I want don't mean I can't help some old boys get a little of what they can't get on their own, does it? 
  Especially if the good old boys do a turn for Ewing Oil now and then? 
  Well, see there? 
  You're not so dumb. 
  Ray? 
  - Ray. 
  - Yes, sir? 
  That you, Ray? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Be right down. 
  - Good morning. 
  - Morning. 
  Did you take my granddaughter to school today? 
  No, sir. 
  I haven't seen her. 
  - Well, maybe one of the boys took her. 
  - Yeah. 
  You know what? 
  - I want you to do something for me. 
  - Sir? 
  I want you to make sure that Lucy gets to school every day. 
  We've been getting letters saying she misses more than she goes and she ain't ever gonna graduate that way. 
  Sure thing. 
  I'll take care of it. 
  I'm counting on you, boy. 
  Ray? 
  Yeah? 
  You and that fine-looking Barnes girl on or off these days? 
  - Mostly off, sir. 
  - Well, too bad. 
  Thought maybe you might talk to her, get her to call off her brother. 
  - Yeah? 
  What's old Cliff Barnes up to now? 
  - He's turning us Ewings up on TV. 
  Well, you know how it is with us. 
  Soon as I start seeing her again, maybe I can help you out. 
  Sure. 
  Give it a try. 
  Trying's the fun part of it anyway. 
  - Yeah. 
  - See you. 
  Have a good day, sir. 
  Damn. 
  You know how close that was? 
  It weren't close at all. 
  He'd never come up here. 
  - Well, I tell you, if he knew, he'd kill me. 
  - Well, I ain't gonna tell him. 
  - Hey, who's number one, Ray, her or me? 
  - Come on, Lucy. 
  She's probably real different, right? 
  Look I gotta go. 
  - Do you ever call her Lucy by mistake? 
  - No. 
  That would be funny. 
  - Call me her name. 
  - No. 
  Do it. 
  Call me her name. 
  Pam. 
  Again. 
  Pamela. 
  Pamela. 
  - But why, Pam, honey? 
  - Because you could be important. 
  What am I now, a bowl of chili? 
  Bobby, you're the most important thing to me in the world. 
  You know that. 
  But you could be important to more than me. 
  You're the son of a big, powerful oil family. 
  If you wanna make a good impression on Mama remember her side of the family too. 
  - Oh, that's right, oil and cattle. 
  And with your daddy retired, I bet they could use another man to help run the business. 
  - J. R. 's got the brains. 
  Oh, so do you. 
  You've been whooping it up for so many years you haven't shut up long enough to hear how good your brain ticks. 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay what? 
  Okay, I'll tell Daddy and J. R. 
  Tonight. 
  Might as well spring it all on them at once. 
  Oh, Bobby. 
  Pammy! 
  - Bobby's back. 
  - Yeah? 
  And he's bringing home a lady. 
  Must be something special. 
  The ladies he usually runs with he don't bring home to meet Miss Ellie. 
  Hey, Ray, you know this lady. 
  Take a look. 
  - Let me see those things. 
  - Go right ahead. 
  Why is he bringing Pam here? 
  Last couple barbecues you brought her here to While you were getting soused, they were getting chummy. 
  - They're married! 
  - You're crazy. 
  Yeah, you're blind. 
  They're married! 
  Shut up. 
  - It's funny, Ray, l - Shut up. 
  Mama this is my wife. 
  I'm sorry. 
  L I don't know what to say. 
  Well, you could start by saying good luck. 
  And hello. 
  Miss Ellie, do you mind if I freshen up a little? 
  No, of course not. 
  - I'll show you, honey. 
  - I'll find it. 
  Excuse me, Bobby. 
  Thank you. 
  Isn't she pretty, Mama? 
  She's also Cliff Barnes' sister and Digger Barnes' daughter. 
  - Now, Mama - I don't want to hear any "Now, Mamas"! 
  - You come on inside. 
  - I'll get the bags. 
  It'll keep. 
  Hi. 
  We didn 't have no money for anything like that, Your Honor. 
  - Jock? 
  - Yes, Ellie? 
  - Heard anything from Bobby yet? 
  - He's here, Jock, just got in. 
  Well, send him right on. 
  He's got to go to Austin. 
  - I don 't think he can go. 
  - Why not? 
  Because he came home with a wife. 
  - What? 
  - A wife. 
  - He brought a wife home. 
  - Well, who is she? 
  Anybody? 
  J. R. 
  Wants to know if she's anybody. 
  She's anybody all right. 
  And you two best come right on home. 
  Well, I'm not sure I can even tell you how the whole thing happened except that I said, "I love you. 
  " And she said, "I love you. 
  " And I said, "Are you sure?" She said, "Of course I'm sure. 
  " So I said: "Then let's get married right here in this old city of New Orleans. 
  " She said, "Bobby Ewing, that's about the dumbest idea I've ever heard. 
  " Twenty minutes later, there we were standing in front of that old Baptist preacher saying, "I will. 
  " "I will. 
  " And that was that. 
  I never knew you were so impulsive, Bobby. 
  Well, I never knew I was, either. 
  Pamela, you settled in to your room all right? 
  Oh, yes, ma'am. 
  Of course, I only have the one suitcase but I'll go into Dallas tomorrow and get my things. 
  Young lady when's that brother of yours gonna give up that crusade against us Ewings? 
  - This isn't the proper time to discuss that. 
  - I don't know why not. 
  We don't talk business at this hour, Jock. 
  - Anybody want a refill? 
  - Yeah, I believe I will, Father. 
  - Can I help you? 
  - Yeah. 
  Excuse me, Mr. 
  Ewing? 
  - Come in, Ray. 
  Have a drink. 
  - No, thanks, sir. 
  - Ray. 
  - J. R. 
  - I believe you know Pamela here. 
  - Sure. 
  Pam. 
  Hi, Ray. 
  Ray Krebbs, have you heard that our Bobby has married Pamela Barnes? 
  Yeah, I heard. 
  Congratulations to you both. 
  Where are your manners, Ray? 
  You're going to kiss the bride, aren't you? 
  Sure. 
  Where are my manners? 
  Congratulations. 
  - You don't want a drink or anything, Ray? 
  - Some other time, Bobby. 
  I do wanna wish you luck, though. 
  Why, thank you very much. 
  Just sign right here, sir. 
  Much obliged, Ray. 
  Y'all have a good evening, now. 
  - Good night, Ray. 
  - Good night, Ray. 
  Good night. 
  Well, there's some light left. 
  I'd like to show Pamela our little house. 
  Let's just get to know each other first. 
  Well, I always get to know people best one-to-one. 
  You will excuse us? 
  Excuse me, please. 
  It's getting a bit chilly out. 
  I think we ought to get some warm clothes on. 
  I think this is all so exciting. 
  Don't you, Sue Ellen? 
  Weddings always are, aren't they? 
  - Fine country, isn't it? 
  - It's beautiful. 
  I got to apologize for my father. 
  He's from another generation. 
  He's just used to speaking his own mind. 
  Now, he really doesn't expect you to reveal anything about your brother's political activities. 
  - Well, I don't know anything to reveal. 
  Well, of course you don't. 
  This is Mother's garden. 
  It doesn't look like much now but in the spring it just bursts with beauty. 
  - I can't wait to see it. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, Sue Ellen and I this is our little house over here. 
  It's not very big, but it's comfortable. 
  Has a little kitchen and a sitting room and even has a extra bedroom that we're thinking of making into a nursery. 
  - Oh, is Sue Ellen? 
  - No, no, no. 
  Not yet. 
  But it's just a matter of time. 
  We do want an heir to head the family and the business for the next generation. 
  - Me and Bobby want kids too. 
  - Of course you do. 
  - Who lives there? 
  - No one now. 
  That's my middle brother Gary's house. 
  He used to live there with a little bride, briefly. 
  Did your brother put you up to this, Miss Barnes? 
  Well, I don't think that's an unusual question to ask, Miss Barnes. 
  - Mrs. 
  Ewing. 
  Excuse me, please. 
  - Perhaps it'd be more appropriate to ask what sort of settlement you'd require to annul this farce. 
  Let go of my arm. 
  I'm willing to spend some money now to avoid any inconvenience. 
  But if you insist on being driven away, which you surely will be you're gonna come out without anything. 
  Hi there. 
  What's going on? 
  Oh, just talking a little business. 
  Mama don't like business talk with supper on the table, J. R. 
  Well, you know Mama. 
  She's so old-fashioned. 
  Come on, honey, let's go. 
  I didn't know you were allowed to smoke those things. 
  Smoke what things? 
  I asked her how much she'd take. 
  You did what? 
  - I tried to pay her off. 
  - You jackass. 
  Now, wait a minute, Daddy. 
  You called me at the office upset because Cliff Barnes is crucifying us on TV. 
  You really want Bobby married to his sister? 
  I ain't saying I do but it's about time you learned the art of subtlety. 
  Well, why should I be subtle? 
  Because the lack of it turns competitors into enemies, and enemies into fanatics. 
  - Anyway, I ain't so sure it's a bad thing. 
  - You're not? 
  Well, you've seen what's happening. 
  Bobby wanting to come in off the road, be an executive. 
  What's wrong with that? 
  - P. R. 
  Is important. 
  - Pimping, that's what it is. 
  I got nothing against him settling down and taking on a little responsibility. 
  - Well, you put me in your chair, Daddy. 
  - Sure, that's fine. 
  Just keep it that way. 
  But I got more than one son and nobody says that you've got to run things alone. 
  You better go see your wife, junior. 
  If they get too much of a head start, my first grandson's gonna be theirs. 
  Good night. 
  J. R. 
  Thought you might wanna talk to me. 
  - How in hell did she end up marrying him? 
  - You're asking me? 
  I brought her to a couple of barbecues here. 
  I didn't know they were getting on that well. 
  I don't about you, but I won't stand for this. 
  I don't wanna stand still for it either, J. R. , but they're married, ain't they? 
  Yeah. 
  So were those fine ladies we spent that memorable weekend with up at Waco last year. 
  So they were. 
  - What are you gonna do? 
  - Not me us. 
  You and me, Ray. 
  We're gonna bust it up, Raymond. 
  What else? 
  Yeah, what else? 
  You getting up? 
  Or you just gonna roll in when I open the door? 
  - What are you doing up from Austin? 
  - No hearings today. 
  When I heard about my little sister getting married What do you think you're doing marrying a Ewing? 
  Marrying a man. 
  Bobby Ewing is not a man. 
  Pamela, he's a Ewing. 
  You know who those people are. 
  They're me now. 
  You know, you used to be worse than I was. 
  Breaking out windows in the Ewing building downtown. 
  - You used to plot revenge. 
  - Maybe marrying one is the best revenge. 
  Oh, I'll bet the Ewings think so. 
  I don't care what they think. 
  I don't care what you think. 
  I love Bobby Ewing, that's it. 
  Well, I don't believe you. 
  Because I think you do care what they think. 
  And I think you care what I think. 
  I think you care a lot. 
  I'll send a truck for the rest of this. 
  I got it. 
  Let's go. 
  What about Digger? 
  When you gonna tell him? 
  - I'll get around to it. 
  - Get around to it. 
  Come on, Pam telling your father ought to be first priority. 
  - I can't deal with Digger now. 
  - Don't blame you. 
  Just don't go telling me how strong you are. 
  Where are you going? 
  What is this? 
  Is that? 
  I don't believe that car. 
  All right, I believe it. 
  Where you going? 
  - Pam, where you going? 
  - To look for Digger. 
  Are you coming? 
  No. 
  And I'm not riding in that car. 
  Fine. 
  Yeah, just in front of the sofa, guys. 
  Thanks. 
  - Julie? 
  - Your new secretary. 
  Wanna meet her? 
  Not right yet. 
  Thank you. 
  Julie I'm gonna need the combination to the safe. 
  Well, J. R. 
  Changes it every month. 
  I'll have to ask him. 
  How's baby brother doing? 
  He wants the combination. 
  Well, how's all that reading coming along? 
  Get through that yet? 
  - It's all pretty much routine, J. R. 
  - Well, nobody ever said nuts and bolts are interesting, but they hold everything together. 
  - I'd like to look at the red files now. 
  - Lf you think what you've been reading is dull, wait till those red files. 
  Come on, J. R. 
  By the time I was 3 years old I knew the red files meant current and important. 
  When Daddy retired, I remember he very ceremoniously presented you with the combination. 
  - So don't tell me it's all routine. 
  - Okay. 
  I just thought you ought to get through that harder stuff procedures and operations and everything. 
  Background stuff is real important. 
  Okay, Bobby, here you go. 
  Thank you very much. 
  Anytime. 
  Anything you need, you just let me know. 
  - I'll be with you in just a minute. 
  - Okay, thanks. 
  I want you to go to the bank, put this in my safety deposit box. 
  Aren't you gonna share your secrets with your little brother? 
  You just do like I tell you. 
  Come on, buddy, another drink here! 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you, sir. 
  That's mighty nice of you. 
  Now, 1930 was my year. 
  My partner and I walked out right here in Texas and I just followed my nose, and I said, "Here!" And he went back to register the claim and I stayed there and I drilled and when I thought we had enough, I said, "That's plenty. 
  " And he looked at me and laughed in my face and said that I owned nothing. 
  Nothing at all. 
  I even owed him some money. 
  Well, I tried to kill I tried to kill Jock Ewing once or twice, but I bungled it. 
  See, I can drill, but I can't kill. 
  There you have it, Pammy, a product of Jock Ewing's ethics. 
  - Hey, we're not ready to - Come on. 
  It's all right. 
  It's all right. 
  Cliff. 
  No more drinks? 
  Listen, don't take him away, we're having a good time here. 
  What's going on? 
  There. 
  - Pammy. 
  - Hi, Daddy. 
  - Are you okay? 
  - Sure, sure, sure. 
 
 
 
  Daddy, l I came I came to tell you I came to tell you that I got married. 
  Well, now, what do you think of that? 
  Daddy, please don't be mad or hurt. 
  I love my husband, Daddy. 
  Sure you do. 
  But he's He's Bobby Ewing. 
  - Daddy, the boy I married is a Ewing. 
  - Jock Ewing's boy. 
  - Well, can you move that? 
  - I haven't got enough yellow here. 
  - Josie, don't forget to light the candles. 
  - I won't. 
  - But at the last minute. 
  - Yes, ma'am. 
  Hi. 
  Y'all look busy. 
  - Just a few friends coming over tonight. 
  - Can I help? 
  Oh, I don't think so. 
  We got sort of a routine here, you know? 
  Raul, would you put these spoons over there, please? 
  - I had your bags sent upstairs for you. 
  - Thank you. 
  - You ain't got a chance. 
  - What do you mean? 
  Well, when they don't want somebody, that somebody ain't got a chance. 
  - Do you ride horses? 
  - I wish I did. 
  All you need is a good teacher. 
  Ray Krebbs would teach you if you asked him nice. 
  Did you ever hear the story of how I come to be here? 
  No. 
  My daddy, he's the third brother in the middle. 
  - Gary. 
  I heard about him. 
  - The black sheep. 
  A drunk, like your daddy. 
  Anyways, once upon a time he went off and got this lovely My mommy. 
  He brought her home, but he couldn't do nothing right. 
  He started drinking all the time. 
  Disappeared for weeks and months came back again and started hitting my mom. 
  So she up and left, her and me. 
  When J. R. 
  Found out, he called some nice old boys in Dallas. 
  They went after her. 
  They caught up with her all the way over to Virginia and they took back the baby. 
  Me. 
  They told her that if she ever came near Texas again, they'd kill her. 
  Yeah, one time, I even heard she went to the law to get me back. 
  Didn't amount to anything, though. 
  It was J. R. 
  Who done it all. 
  You ain't got a chance, lady. 
  Bobby, you said it'd get better, and instead, it's getting worse. 
  - Nobody said 10 words to me at dinner. 
  - I don't know, honey maybe I was being too much an optimist. 
  In my former position, being an optimist was a virtue. 
  It'll just take a while to adjust, that's all. 
  Come in. 
  Bobby, I'm sorry, I don't mean to disturb you. 
  We just got word the hearings have been closed for a while. 
  I want you to get down to Austin next couple of days. 
  J. R. 
  , I thought this was all decided. 
  Bobby, this is the last time, but it's gotta be done. 
  Some old boys down there owe us, and I want you to remind them of that. 
  The ones that don't owe us, it gives you time to rectify that. 
  J. R. 
  , I said I was through with this kind of work. 
  Now, Bobby, you'll be through when the hearings are over. 
  I want you to leave in the morning. 
  Shouldn't take more than three, four days. 
  Night, now. 
  - It's the last time, honey. 
  I promise. 
  - Sure, Bobby. 
  It's family, Pammy. 
  What can I say? 
  No. 
  Go up to the north pasture and see if you can spot any of those strays. 
  I don't know what happened to them. 
  They're just gone. 
  Gone. 
  - Pamela, where's Bobby? 
  - He'll be out in a minute. 
  - Oh, yeah? 
  You going for a walk? 
  - Yeah. 
  Say, Ray's going up in the helicopter today and since you're a Ewing now, I really want you to see the place right. 
  So why don't you go up with him? 
  - No, thanks. 
  - No? 
  Is something the matter? 
  - You afraid of flying, or - No, I'm not afraid of flying. 
  - Okay. 
  Sounds like a good idea. 
  - Hey, you're gonna like it. 
  Hey you ever been up in a helicopter before? 
  - No. 
  Forget anything I said, all right? 
  Just show her the whole place anything she wants to do. 
  Okay. 
  - Bobby. 
  - J. R. 
  - Have you seen Pammy this morning? 
  - Well, yeah, I did. 
  She was fixing to take a walk around here. 
  Well, she must be upset about this trip. 
  I can't say I blame her. 
  Oh, it's wrong feeling sorry for yourself, boy. 
  I just don't like leaving without saying goodbye, that's all. 
  Yeah, there's plenty of oil underneath this ranch land too, I expect. 
  Old man Southworth, Miss Ellie's daddy he left the Southfork to Jock Ewing but with the provision that it remain a working ranch. 
  Running cattle, it don't bring in much. 
  Not compared to oil, anyhow. 
  But old Jock, he's gotten to love it, the cow part. 
  Likes to think of himself as a rancher. 
  Who was I kidding? 
  What? 
  Nothing. 
  Hey, how about this, now? 
  What do you think of that? 
  - You're gonna get your feet wet. 
  - No, we're okay. 
  We're okay. 
  Let's set her down over here, now. 
  Bobby, you could've had any woman in Texas. 
  I didn't want that anymore. 
  So she's special. 
  Why? 
  Because the way she makes you feel? 
  Oh, hell, Bobby, Ray Krebbs has been telling me about that girl for years. 
  - That's enough, J. R. 
  - I don't think it is. 
  We need you down in Austin. 
  Things happening down there that are important, could mean millions to us. 
  But it's not as important as your peace of mind. 
  Oh, to hell with it. 
  - J. R. , what are you doing? 
  - Something distasteful but necessary. 
  It's not working out, is it, Pam? 
  No, it's not. 
  Well, there's something to be said for like sticking to like. 
  I never believed that before. 
  What are you gonna do now, Pam? 
  I don't know. 
  Hey maybe this isn't the time to say this but you and me, it was good. 
  Real good. 
  We should have got hitched a long time ago. 
  I guess I just needed to lose you to realize that. 
  Oh, Ray, that's so sweet. 
  You've been sweet right along. 
  Maybe it's not too late. 
  Oh, I don't know. 
  I can't even think straight. 
  Sure. 
  - Well, aren't you gonna swim? 
  - Are you kidding? 
  It's freezing. 
  - You used to like the cold. 
  - Not that much. 
  You know, in the old days, I wouldn't have had to do this. 
  No! 
  Oh, it's cold! 
  - Oh, what a lovely idea! 
  - It was a hell of an idea. 
  It's cold! 
  Oh, you are mean, you know that? 
  - Well, now it wasn't That's real - We'll go up to the shack. 
  I'll build a fire, make us some food and coffee. 
  Okay? 
  - Just like old times. 
  - No, in old times, it was summer. 
  Sure you don't want some more of this hot joe, now? 
  - I'm fine. 
  - You don't like my coffee. 
  Oh, I love your coffee. 
  You're so beautiful. 
  Shouldn't we be getting back now? 
  Now you're gonna tell me this isn't the most fun you've had in the last three days. 
  - I had a real good time. 
  - Yeah. 
  - What's that? 
  - What? 
  Wait a minute. 
  It's J. R. 
  Well, it can't be. 
  He's on the way to Austin with Bobby. 
  Well, it is, and Bobby's with him. 
  - This is a setup. 
  - What? 
  J. R. 
  Set me up and you helped him? 
  No, Pam, I don't know where you get that idea. 
  Nothing happened here. 
  You better back me up. 
  I can't help what conclusions your husband's gonna draw. 
  Yes, you can. 
  And if you don't back me up, I'll tell J. R. 
  About you and Lucy. 
  - Me and Lucy? 
  - I saw you coming out of the barn. 
  She couldn't wait to tell me all about it. 
  - Lf you tell J. R. , he's gonna kill me. 
  - That's right. 
  So back me up and make it good. 
  - Hi, J. R. 
  - Pamela. 
  Hi, honey. 
  Nice to see you. 
  Isn't it nice J. R. 
  Knew exactly where we'd be? 
  Pam fell in the lake. 
  I slipped in trying to help her out. 
  - Bobby, if I were you - lf I were you, I'd shut up. 
  Ray showed me the ranch, but it was J. R. 's idea. 
  Is that true, J. R. ? 
  Is that why going to Austin could wait till you brought me up here? 
  It stops right now, J. R. 
  Pamela's my wife, and you're gonna treat her with respect. 
  - Listen, little brother - No, I won't listen! 
  - Stop that "little brother" nonsense too. 
  - Just hold on. 
  We'll always be brothers, J. R but if you ever try and force me to choose there's not a chance in a million I'd choose you or any family above my wife! 
  - Are you listening? 
  - Yeah, I'm listening. 
  Pamela's past is none of my business. 
  She was not my wife in the past, but she is now. 
  And you'd better remember it. 
  It was a dumb, stupid trick, J. R.! 
  If you ever do it again He's your brother! 
  Please. 
  She's my wife, J. R. 
  And she's gonna stay that way. 
  Come on, honey. 
  Sorry, J. R. 
  - A couple more minutes  
  - It's all right, Ray. 
  Not your fault it's mine. 
  I underestimated the new Mrs. Ewing. 
  Well, I surely won't do that again.
