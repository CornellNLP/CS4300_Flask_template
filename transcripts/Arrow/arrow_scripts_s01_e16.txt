 My name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years, I was stranded on an island with only one goal-- survive. 
 Oliver Queen is alive. 
 Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 
 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 I'd like you to work with me on the Vigilante investigation. 
 Thank you, sir! 
 It's just beginning. 
 In six months, the organization's vision of what this city should be will be complete. 
 Thousands of innocent people will be dead and you'll feel nothing. 
 That's not true. 
 I'll feel a sense of accomplishment. 
 So... 
 How can we be of assistance? 
 Malcolm Merlyn. I want you to kill him for me. 
 These black arrows aren't consistent with his M.O. 
 Something doesn't add up. 
 We're dealing with a copycat. 
 [Sirens] 
 What do you mean, the chopper's about to touch down? 
 The flight log doesn't have them due for another 20 minutes! 
 Then lock down the heliport! 
 [Sirens] 
 I've just landed in Starling City. 
 We agreed-- half on arrival, the other half when the job is done. 
 [Chuckles] Gracias. 
 Don't worry. 
 The man's as good as-- 
 [Arrow whirring] 
 Guillermo Barrera. 
 You have failed this city. 
 You've built quite a reputation. 
 And you should have stayed overseas. 
 I thought about it, but then I remembered-- 
 I've got a reputation, too. 
 [Both grunting]

 Arrow 
Season 1 Episode 16 
 Dead to Rights 
Original Air Date on February 27, 2013 
 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 Ahh! Ow! 
 Now the trick is to keep your weight evenly distributed. 
 I thought the trick was to avoid getting into fights. 
 Yeah, well, Starling City's not the kind of place where you can talk your way out of trouble. 
 Besides, if you're going to be working with us, I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that you can handle yourself... 
 At least a little bit. 
 [Footsteps on stairs] 
 How'd it go? 
 Badly for him. 
 Who's him? 
 An assassin for hire with an affinity for knives. 
 His name was Guillermo Barrera. 
 Was? 
 So we can't ask him about his intended target? 
 No. 
 Which is why I need you to hack his phone. 
 Barrera's world class. 
 He kills high profile targets. 
 And whatever job he was hired for isn't finished. 
 We need to figure out who he was here to kill, and fast. 
 They are probably still in danger. 
 Ok? 
 Yeah. 
 I have to meet McKenna. 
 Good thing she didn't meet you at the heliport. 
 May not be a good idea to fall for the cop that's hunting you down. 
 Well, it's slim pickings for us vigilantes. 
 [Grunting] 
 Four. 
 Well, I'm more of a runner. 
 [Grunting] 
 Why the sudden desire to work out? 
 What else is there to do? 
 Well, we can try to think of another way off the island. 
 There is no other way. 
 If there was, I would have found it. 
 We can't just sit here and wait for Fyers to come and kill us. 
 I did have one idea. 
 If you go into the forest and gather as much bamboo as you can find... 
 Yeah? 
 We could build ourselves a boat, like they did on "Gilligan's Island." 
 That's broken. 
 It got busted during the crash. 
 Did you try to get it to work? 
 I'm better at pulling things apart. 
 My father was a pilot and he used to do his own maintenance. 
 So you're hoping aircraft maintenance is genetic? 
 No, I used to help him and I liked it. 
 Then I got pretty good at it. 
 So maybe I can make the radio work. 
 You should be training for the inevitable fight that's looming. 
 I think I have a better chance of making the radio work. 
 Hey. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 No, I am. I just got caught up at the office. 
 Me, too. Wow. 
 You look nice. 
 Ooh. 
 We should go inside. 
 We should. 
 [Laughs] 
 We don't seem to be going inside. 
 Welcome. 
 Happy Birthday, buddy. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, this feels like a Chateauneuf de Pape. 
 It's going to taste like one, too. 
 You are a true friend. 
 Thank you. 
 Tommy, you remember McKenna Hall. 
 From back in the day. 
 And back again. 
 Ollie. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Laurel, this is... 
 McKenna Hall. 
 We know each other from the court house. 
 How are you, counselor? 
 I'm well, Detective. 
 I'm going to go crack this open. 
 Come in. 
 Such a nice apartment. 
 So much space. 
 Oh, this is adorable. 
 How old are you here? 
 That's actually my sister Sara. 
 Oh, I am so sorry. 
 No, no, it's ok. 
 I don't know why my father bought her that canary. 
 That thing chirped night and day. 
 Drove us all nuts. 
 A toast. 
 To the first birthday that I have enjoyed in a long time. 
 I got my best friend back. 
 And... 
 I have finally figured out why poets have been in business for the last few thousand years. 
 Happy Birthday, baby. 
 Thank you. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 [Knock on door] 
 I think that's the food. 
 Oh, ok. 
 Oh, thank God, she didn't cook. 
 Amen. 
 Mr. Merlyn. 
 Laurel. 
 Can I come in? 
 Oliver. 
 Mr. Merlyn. 
 I've been trying to get in touch with you. 
 What are you doing here, Dad? 
 Happy Birthday, Tommy. 
 Just give us a second. 
 Of course. 
 We're about to eat. 
 I can't stay. 
 Well, that works out because you weren't invited. 
 I'm being honored by the Starling City Municipal Group. 
 They're bestowing me with their annual Humanitarian Award. 
 What, they ran out of actual humans to give it to? 
 I would like you to be there, if you could. 
 I am 100% certain that I'll be busy. 
 You might not believe this, but all I ever wanted for you was happiness. 
 If it will allay this tension between us, I'll turn the switch back on. 
 Save your money, Dad. 
 I don't need it anymore. 
 I'd still like you to come to the event. 
 It would mean a lot to me. 
 You know what, Dad? 
 Sometimes the people that you want there the most... 
 Aren't. 
 You taught me that. 
 Multiple times. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hello, Lawton. 
 I see your edge has dulled. 
 Oh, I knew you were there. 
 I just didn't care if you killed me. 
 What do you want? 
 My organization has been contracted to eliminate a certain high profile individual. 
 A very well-guarded target. 
 Well, forget it. 
 Look, I'm retired. 
 To drink and smoke your life away? 
 We all got to die some time. 
 I need someone to die at the right time. 
 And no one does it better than you. 
 My vision... ain't exactly what it used to be. 
 No. 
 It's going to be better. 
 So... 
 Who needs two bullets in the chest? 
 Moira. 
 Is it happening? 
 Yes. 
 The Humanitarian Award ceremony. 
 Isn't that a little public? 
 No one will expect it. 
 I have very welcome news to share with all of you. 
 Thanks to Queen Consolidated's Applied Sciences Division and their recent acquisition of Unidac Industries, the Undertaking which we set for ourselves is only months from fruition. 
 There's hope on the horizon for everyone in Starling. 
 We won't fail this city. 
 And I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're all with you, Malcolm. 
 [Beeping] 
 Jeez, this is one paranoid assassin. 
 Barerra's got cobalt-level encryption on his phone. 
 It's not going to be easy to break. 
 But codebreaker is my middle name. 
 Actually, it's Megan-- 
 Felicity, can you get anything off of it? 
 Just the last number he dialed. 
 Which was? 
 A restaurant in China town. 
 A Jade Dragon. 
 I guess even hired killers enjoy the city's best chow mien. 
 Yeah, Jade Dragon is a front for the Chinese mafia. 
 Call the restaurant, make a reservation for two for tonight. 
 You need to decrypt that phone. 
 I'm kind of in the mood for Chinese now. 
 Hmm. 
 [Man speaking Chinese] 
 [Speaking Chinese] 
 [Both snicker] 
 That is--that is one big fried fish. 
 I was told this was the most authentic Szechwan in town. 
 Whatever. I wanted to make sure that your birthday celebration got its due celebration. 
 It was a little bit, um, tense last night. 
 Well, trust my dad to run all the smiles out of the room. 
 He did come by, and it seemed like he was trying to act a little bit dad-like. 
 Dad-like, that sums up my father perfectly. 
 I know the two of you have never been close, but it couldn't have been easy for him after your mom was killed. 
 Yeah, I guess he forgot that there were two of us in that club. 
 I'm not defending him, Tommy. 
 It's... 
 With everything I've been through, people that I've lost... 
 I know how hard it can be. 
 You probably don't remember this. 
 Ahh... 
 We were eight. 
 But after her funeral, he left for like two years. 
 And when he did come back, he was... he was so frickin' cold. 
 We barely spoke. 
 And that's why I spent so much time at your house. 
 From the outside, it always looked like I had a father. 
 He paid my bills, he lived in the house, he bailed me out. 
 But your dad took me to my first hockey game. 
 Your dad taught me how to fly fish. 
 Your dad took us to our first R-rated movie. 
 But he wasn't perfect. 
 My dad made mistakes. 
 And... 
 We haven't talked about this. 
 But I have a lot of anger towards him. 
 But still, I would give anything to have him back, because... 
 At the end of the day, your dad is... 
 Your dad. 
 I meant what I said last night. 
 I'm... really glad that you're back. 
 I got to hit the restroom. 
 [Screaming] 
 [All grunting and groaning] 
 [Speaking Chinese rapidly] 
 [Speaking Chinese] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Check, please. 
 I hope you like barbecue. 
 Well, don't fall over yourself thanking me for spending six hours up a tree so you can eat. 
 What? 
 Great. I'll eat later. 
 You've been on that for days. 
 Give it a rest. 
 It's because I can do this. 
 Sure, kid. When pigs fly. 
 [Static on radio] 
 You're kidding me. 
 Can you clean this up? 
 I don't know. I don't know how I got this far! 
 Man on radio : Continue approach. Big jet 365. 
 Mayday, mayday, mayday. 
 This is wedgetail 325. 
 Pilot and passenger down. 
 Woman on radio : Big jet 365, cleared to land. 
 Runway 2-7 right, wind, 2-7-0 degrees, 10 knots. 
 I repeat--pilot and passenger down on the island of Lian Yu. 
 Request immediate rescue. 
 Cleared to land, runway 2-7 right. 
 Big jet 365. 
 Damn! 
 They can't hear us, and we can't call out. 
 We're still trapped. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Lance. 
 The Triad have hired a contract killer. 
 Yeah? You mean the one you put in the morgue? 
 Congratulations, you're the talk of the station again. 
 [Disguised voice] They hired one, they're going to hire another, Detective. 
 Who's your target? 
 I'm trying to find out but I'm hitting dead ends. 
 I need you to put your people on it. 
 My people don't work for you. 
 And come to think of it, neither do I. 
 It's not about you and me, Detective. 
 It's about saving a life. 
 Call me back when you got a name. 
 Hall. 
 Yes, sir? 
 You and me. 
 We're going to catch that Vigilante. 
 There are five exit routes from the main floor that need to be cut off. 
 Once the fire alarm goes off, we'll have less than 30 seconds to disable Merlyn's private security and force him outside with the others. 
 Once he's outside... 
 The rest will be up to Mr. Lawton. 
 Roger that. 
 You look handsome! 
 I try not to. 
 It just keeps happening. 
 [Both laugh] 
 What's the occasion? 
 I decided to go to my dad's thing. 
 Really? 
 Are you sure? 
 Oh, mostly. 
 Did you want me to go with you? 
 No, no, no, I know you have work to do. 
 I promise I will be fine. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring] 
 
 
 
 [Classical music playing] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Malcolm : You look beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 If you're free, maybe after the ceremony, we could have dinner and talk like we used to. 
 I'd like that. 
 [Microphone feedback] 
 That's my cue. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I've been trying to avoid him all evening. 
 If we didn't show, it'd look suspicious. 
 How can you talk to him that way? 
 As if nothing's about to happen? 
 I've been living this life for five years. 
 Five more minutes won't matter. 
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
 Now tonight's honoree needs very little introduction. 
 It's neither his wealth nor his name that we celebrate here tonight. 
 But it is his efforts in making Starling City a better and safer place to live. 
 So please help me welcome Starling City's humanitarian of the year, Mr. Malcolm Merlyn. 
 [Applause] 
 [McKenna laughs] 
 And so that's a stage, right. 
 Most nights we'll have a band. 
 Somebody cool. 
 Is Fallout Boy still cool? 
 They broke up. 
 And never. 
 So somebody else will pick the bands. 
 Something bothering you? 
 Don't say no, 'cause you're a terrible liar. 
 Really? 
 I thought I was getting better at it. 
 Mm-mmm. 
 What's wrong? 
 There's a lot of stuff going on in my life. 
 Work. 
 Friends. 
 And I'm having a... difficult time figuring out how to fit it all in. 
 I've been struggling with some of those thoughts, as well. 
 Do you have any good ideas? 
 I think we just have to be really honest about what's going on in our lives. 
 Think you can do that? 
 Come on. 
 I'm in! Yes! 
 Yes! Yes, way to go, Felicity Smoak. 
 You don't happen to speak Spanish, do you? 
 Arabic. 
 Oh, le sigh. 
 [Beep] 
 Oh, my God. 
 You know I'm there for you. 
 Excuse me, Mr. Queen. 
 The I.T. department has that item that you requested. 
 One sec. 
 Ok. 
 You find the target? 
 Oliver, the target is Tommy's father. 
 At the awards ceremony? 
 Tommy's there. 
 Um, McKenna, Mr. Diggle is going to take you home. 
 I have some unexpected business. 
 It's ok. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Lance. 
 Oliver, voice disguised : Target is Malcolm Merlyn. 
 Establish a perimeter but keep your distance. 
 I don't want the police caught in the crossfire. 
 The true humanitarian in the Merlyn family was my wife Rebecca. 
 Many of you here knew her. 
 She tirelessly devoted herself to helping those less fortunate in the Glades. 
 I like to think that if the men who murdered her knew her; knew the work that she did, knew the person that she was... 
 He would have helped her to her car, made sure she was safe, instead of stealing her purse and shooting her. 
 The truth is, I haven't done enough for this city. 
 My city. 
 I failed it. 
 But I promise you-- 
 I am not finished yet. 
 I promise you that this city will be better for all of us. 
 And on that day, I will look at this beautiful award and feel that I have earned it. 
 I thank you. 
 [Applause] 
 [Beep] 
 Oh! 
 [Alarm sounding] 
 Mr. Merlyn, you should head for the exit-- 
 [men grunting] 
 Tommy! 
 [Alarm continues] 
 [Alarm sounding] 
 Merlyn's not taking the bait. 
 Change of plans. 
 I don't like improvisation. 
 Drive him upstairs to his penthouse office. 
 I need to switch vantage points. 
 Tommy! 
 Tommy! 
 Come with me. 
 There's an exit on the second floor. 
 I wasn't leaving until I knew you were safe. 
 [Siren] 
 Go somewhere safe. 
 I'll hold them off. 
 Go now! 
 Come on! 
 Where are we going? 
 Up. 
 Who are those guys? 
 I don't know. 
 They're trying to kill you! 
 Seems that way. 
 And we're going up, without any of your bodyguards? 
 Dad! We need to get out of here. 
 Tommy, take a deep breath and trust me. 
 Upstairs in my office is a panic room. 
 We get there, we seal it off. 
 Merlyn's headed to the penthouse. 
 Why do you want Malcolm Merlyn dead? 
 I'll settle for you. 
 Wait! 
 Go! 
 You killed him! 
 Surely as he would have killed you. 
 Move, move, move! 
 Electromagnetic locks. 
 What if they cut the power? 
 This floor is on an entire separate grid. 
 The glass? 
 Lexan. Bulletproof. 
 It's over. 
 How did you know how to do that? 
 What? 
 Fight. 
 Kill. 
 Dad? 
 [Both grunting] 
 Freeze! SCPD. 
 Put the bow down. 
 [Coughing and groaning] 
 Tommy, you ok? 
 Dad! 
 Dad?! 
 Turn around slowly. 
 Dad. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Groaning] I'm ok. 
 I'm ok. 
 Damn it. 
 You're bleeding. 
 You're bleeding. 
 I'll be fine, Tom. 
 No, no, no, Dad! 
 Dad! 
 No! 
 Stay back. 
 [Voice disguised] I'm not here to hurt you or your father. 
 I said stay back. 
 Curare. 
 Don't come any closer. 
 Your father's been poisoned. 
 An assassin named Floyd Lawton laces his bullets with curare. 
 I've dealt with this before. 
 We need to dilute the poison in his bloodstream. 
 I said stay the hell back! 
 In three minutes he's paralyzed. 
 In four minutes, he suffocates. 
 If you don't let me help you now, he's dead before anybody gets here! 
 Help. How? 
 Fresh blood buys him time to get to the hospital. 
 A blood transfusion? 
 That's insane! 
 It's the only way. 
 He needs your blood. 
 You're out of time. 
 You need to make a decision right now. 
 Why should I trust you?! 
 [Normal voice] 
 Because you always have. 
 Oliver. 
 Ok. Ready? 
 Do it. 
 Hold his arm. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 You're the Vigilante. 
 Why? 
 Later. 
 He's still going to need medical attention to fully clean out his system, you understand? 
 Ok. 
 Thank you. 
 Tommy. 
 I'm right here, Dad. 
 [Chuckles, sighs] 
 What did the Hood say to you? 
 He didn't say anything. 
 You let a homicidal maniac talk you into a homemade blood transfusion instead of calling the paramedics? 
 My father's life was at stake. 
 So first the Hood rescues you and Queen from those kidnappers, now he saves your old man. 
 But he's taking down every other one percenter out there. 
 Is this guy a friend of yours, Merlyn? 
 I don't know who the hell he is. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Siren] 
 If they can't hear us, then what's the point? 
 Wait! 
 You still might have done us some good. 
 Man on radio : 0500 hours from my mark. 
 Final deployment is five by five. 
 That's Fyers! 
 I'm tuned into the soldier's frequency. 
 Scylla is in route. 
 ETA 0600 hours. 
 At the southwest bay. 
 I'll call you when Scylla is in my possession. 
 Fyers out. 
 Who was Fyers talking to? 
 I don't know. 
 Sounds like someone off this island, maybe his benefactor. 
 More importantly, who or what is Scylla? 
 The Scylla and Charibdis. 
 It's "The Odyssey," from one of the four nightmare chapters. 
 Scylla was a monster. 
 I want to meet this monster. 
 Am I going alone? 
 So how's it feel to save a one percenter? 
 Looks like Malcolm Meryln's going to be ok. 
 They took him to Starling General. 
 Good thing he was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
 He's not in the hospital because he was shot. 
 He was poisoned by curare. 
 [Sighs] 
 Lawton's alive. 
 I'm sorry, John. 
 This Lawton kick his dog or something? 
 No. 
 He killed his brother. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 You were right. 
 Scylla is a monster. 
 A Russian-made S300 anti-aircraft missile launcher. 
 It can simultaneously track up to a hundred targets while engaging with at least a dozen. 
 I mean, from here, they could shoot down a commercial airliner, or start a war. 
 Hey, you're here. 
 Yeah. 
 Walk with me. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I heard you were there, are you ok? 
 I'm fine. Fine. 
 Listen, McKenna, I'm-- 
 I'm really sorry that I had to run out on you like that. 
 Don't worry. 
 Five more minutes, and I would have had to run out on you. 
 [Sighs] Our lives are complicated. 
 But I'm willing to figure us out. 
 If you are. 
 Willing and able. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Gasps and groans] 
 Hey. Hey, Dad. 
 Dad, Dad. 
 Take it easy. 
 You were shot. 
 The bullet was laced with poison. 
 I should be dead. 
 I gave you a blood transfusion. 
 Actually it was... the Vigilante's idea. 
 He saved you. 
 He did? 
 I was worried I was going to lose you. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 You said that after mom died. 
 But you left. 
 I wasn't a very good father to you after your mother passed away. 
 I was so lost. 
 You never told me where you went. 
 I found myself in a place called Nanda Parbat. 
 I met a man there. 
 He helped me make sense of things. 
 He helped me to find a purpose for my life; to make this city a better place for everyone. 
 Especially for you. 
 How are you going to do that? 
 Moira : Malcolm? 
 Tommy. 
 Could I talk to Moira for a minute? 
 Thank God you're all right. 
 We have a traitor in our midst. 
 I want you to find out who. 
 He just made his last mistake. 
 My dad's going to be ok, thanks to you. 
 It's thanks to you. 
 No one's asked you what happened to you out on that island. 
 You said "a lot." 
 That doesn't quite cover it. 
 Tommy... 
 I saw you kill those guys who kidnapped us when you first got back, didn't I? 
 I... 
 I know you have a lot of questions. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, but for now, just the one. 
 Were you ever going to tell me? 
 No. 
 Tommy, I just saw it all on the news. 
 I'll be there as soon as I can. 
 Bye. 
 Hello, Laurel. 
 Mom? 
 What are you doing here? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 About what? 
 I know I've made mistakes. 
 [Scoffs] Yeah. 
 Yes, you have. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look, I have to go. 
 Why don't you send me an email or a postcard some time? 
 I have something important I need to discuss with you. 
 What could be so important after all this time? 
 It's about Sara. 
 What about her? 
 I think she may be alive.
