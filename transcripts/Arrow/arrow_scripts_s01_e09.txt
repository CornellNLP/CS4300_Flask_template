 My name is Oliver Queen. For 5 years I was stranded on an island with only one goal-- to survive. 
 Oliver Queen is alive. 
 Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish-- to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning my city. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else. 
 Previously on "Arrow"... 
 Stop looking into this. 
 It's not safe. 
 Accidents tend to befall people who are too curious. 
 Felicity, I want you to find out all you can about that book. 
 I got these from applied sciences. 
 Look at the book again. 
 Where can I find the man in this picture? 
 Aah! 
 Island dangerous, but you not tell them where to find me. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
 Look, all I'm doing is looking to get something going again. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I know, but this time-- 
 [creaking] 
 I have to call you back. 
 What? 
 Did you come back for another pound of flesh? 
 You're gonna be disappointed, pal. 
 Thanks to you, I'm-- 
 [thwack thwack thwack] 
 Nice. Picking up the pace. 
 I could say the same thing about you. 
 You crossed 3 names off your father's list this week alone. 
 Yeah, well, some of these guys are just giving it up now. 
 All I gotta do is pay 'em a visit. 
 It seems the vigilante's reputation is beginning to precede him. 
 Ah! 
 Whoo. 
 [Groans] 
 Another round? 
 No. 
 Gonna take my nephew over to the mall so he can let Santa know what he wants for Christmas. 
 Oh. Christmas. 
 I didn't even realize. 
 That was because you've been logging in so many hood hours ever since that thing with Helena. 
 I meant... 
 There were no holidays on the island. 
 Every day was... 
 How do I stay alive? 
 To do that, you had to forget things, like Christmas. 
 My dad threw a party every year, and he would put a Christmas tree in every room. 
 The whole mansion smelled like... 
 It smelled like Christmas. 
 Maybe you can give the list a rest and just enjoy the holidays with the family. 
 Besides, I hear St. Nick has a list of his own. 
 I wager you're in the "nice" column. 
 Go home, Oliver. 
 [Rocks falling] 
 You not, uh, hurt? 
 Where the hell you been? 
 I ran out of food and water days ago. 
 Hey--hey, where are you going? 
 You-- 
 Uhh! Oh! 
 Stop! 
 Stop. 
 He's the one who tied me up and had me tortured. 
 All 'cause he was looking for you. 
 He would've killed me if you didn't show up! 
 Then you kill him. 
 [Coughs] 
 Or he can take you home. 
 What? 
 He has a plane. 
 A way for you off this island. 
 Hey. You look very pretty. 
 What's the occasion? 
 Mom and Walter are having a dinner party with some big muckety-mucks. 
 Best night of my life. 
 Thea, why aren't there any decorations up in the house? 
 What do you mean? 
 No wreaths, no trees. 
 Everyone has just been really busy lately. 
 I'm sure they haven't got around to it yet. 
 Does mom at least have some of those boxes of candy canes? 
 Remember we used to race to see who'd finish first? 
 Yeah. I always won. 
 No. You cheated. 
 Well, she went sugar-free last year, so I doubt you'll be seeing any of those around. 
 The thing that people forget is that Robin Hood was a criminal. 
 And stealing from the rich to give to the poor is really the job of the Democrats. 
 [Chuckling] 
 All joking aside, Commissioner, crime is down for the first time in 5 years. 
 That's because of the changes my department has implemented. 
 Or perhaps it's because the vigilante's activities have had a chilling effect on the city's criminals. 
 What are your thoughts, Oliver? 
 I think the vigilante needs a better code name than "The Hood" or "The Hood Guy." 
 [Laughter] 
 I agree. 
 How about Green Arrow? 
 Lame. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Forgive me. 
 It's the office. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm in the middle of a dinner party, Ms. Smoak, so I hope this is of some importance. 
 I guess that depends on how you define important. 
 See, most people would consider finding a list of names written in subsonic ultraviolet invisible ink important. 
 But then I already know that, now, don't I? 
 Did you know 7 of the names on the list are guys the vigilante's had in his crosshairs? 
 That is, if bows had crosshairs. 
 Which they don't. 
 Well, it is a rather long list, Felicity, so I would expect there to be some overlap. 
 Like Doug Miller. 
 Head of Applied Sciences at Queen Consolidated. 
 What of him? 
 Mr. Miller may end up getting an arrow in his stocking, because he's on the list. 
 So, important or not? 
 [Whispering] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Something's come up. 
 Is everything okay? 
 The vigilante has struck again. 
 He just put an arrow in Adam Hunt. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Oops. 
 I really do need to take this call. 
 It's my contractor. 
 Of course. 
 Excuse me. 
 Well, the daughter came over, used her key, found dad. 
 Hat trick to the chest. 
 The hood guy. 
 That's what I thought at first. 
 But these black arrows aren't consistent with his M.O. 
 And neither is the fact that the Hood took Hunt for $40 million a few months ago. 
 It doesn't make sense to kill him now. 
 Something doesn't add up. 
 We're dealing with a copycat. 
 
 Arrow 
Season 1 Episode 09 
 Year's End 
Original Air Date on December 12, 2012 
 
 Who would kill Adam Hunt with an arrow? 
 I mean, other than you? 
 A setup, maybe. 
 You mean someone looking to cover up killing Hunt by making it look like the work of the Hood? 
 Whoever he was, he's good. 
 The grouping on Hunt's chest was tight. 
 It's a compound bow, most likely. 
 The guy is a... 
 The guy's a legitimate archer. 
 So someone who would be particular about his choice of arrows. 
 We get an arrow, we get a bead on where he purchased them. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 What anyone does when they need help. 
 Call a cop. 
 Quentin Lance? 
 Yeah. 
 Sign here, please. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 [Cell phone vibrating] 
 Lance. 
 [Voice altered] 
 I didn't kill Adam Hunt. 
 You... 
 You call me the Hood. 
 It's not a great nickname. 
 You told commissioner Nudocerdo that you might be dealing with a copycat, Another archer, which makes me your best bet to take him down. 
 But I need your help. 
 I need one of the arrows from his murder. 
 Yeah, we're pretty good at pulling down leads off evidence. Thanks. 
 Not like I am. I can do things the police can't, go places they won't. 
 Like I said, I don't even know who-- 
 If this archer doesn't stop with Adam Hunt, we both have a problem. 
 Think about it. 
 Then call me. 
 Number's programmed in. 
 [Door opens] 
 Doug. Thanks for coming. 
 Of course. 
 How is the construction coming along on the Applied Sciences Center? 
 Over budget and behind schedule. 
 Exactly as expected. 
 Is that what you wanted to see me about? 
 No. 
 Adam Hunt. He was murdered last night by the vigilante. 
 I read about that. 
 I've been concerned by the idea that the vigilante might target an employee or officer of this company. 
 Security red-flagged you. 
 Me? Why would this guy go after me? 
 Well, that's a point I was hoping you could shed some light on. 
 You got me. 
 From what I've read, this vigilante only goes after white-collar criminals. 
 Well, let's just hope he doesn't decide to branch out. 
 I think there should be a national holiday for the guy that invented French fries. 
 Or at least a statue or something. 
 There is no Christmas party, is there? 
 Thea, dad threw one of these every year. 
 Do people think I just wasn't gonna notice? 
 Hi, Thea. 
 Hi. Shane. 
 This is my brother Oliver. 
 Nice to meet you, Thea's brother. 
 I bet the food on that island is better than this stuff they're serving here, huh? 
 You'd lose that bet. 
 We're heading down to the bay to hang out if you want to come. 
 Thanks, but I'm spending the afternoon with my brother. 
 Another time. 
 See ya. 
 How do you know that Shane guy? 
 We rob banks and smoke crack together. 
 That's funny, yeah. I have a feeling I'm not gonna be a fan. 
 You don't even know him. 
 Let's change the subject. 
 Fine. You were gonna tell me why we're not having the annual Christmas party. 
 [Sighs] 
 When you and dad disappeared, by the time Christmas rolled around, none of us felt much like celebrating, so we kind of skipped Christmas that year. 
 Every year. 
 And it's really fine, so... 
 No. No, it's really not. 
 We're celebrating Christmas. 
 I went 5 years without it, and then Thea tells me that you guys didn't have it either and I'm the reason. 
 So maybe now I can be the reason we have Christmas again. 
 I thought I would throw the Queen Christmas party. 
 You? 
 I know that I haven't been the son or the stepson or the brother that all of you deserve. 
 Especially lately. 
 But this feels like the right moment to start making up for lost time. 
 What do you say? 
 I say yes. 
 Yes! Okay. I will take care of everything. 
 You don't have to do anything. 
 Just show up, look fantastic, and bring some Christmas cheer, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Fine. 
 You're a good man, Oliver. 
 You're a good man. 
 I can see it. 
 Well, beneath the privileged upbringing and the wealthy veneer. 
 I saw it when my man tortured you and you wouldn't give up your friend. 
 Not even a friend, really. 
 Someone you just met. 
 Shut up. 
 What do you know about him? 
 Nothing, I suspect. 
 Do you even know what this island really is? 
 It's a prison. 
 I mean this literally. 
 Until 8 years ago, the Chinese military operated this island as a penitentiary for criminals deemed so dangerous, they couldn't be safely incarcerated on the mainland. 
 When the military shut the program down, my unit came in and disposed of all the inmates. 
 With the exception of two. 
 Your friend was one of them. 
 Who was the other? 
 You met him. 
 He presided over your interrogation. 
 He tortured me. 
 You had information I needed. 
 What would you do in my position? 
 What would you do to capture the man who slaughtered dozens of people? 
 Douglas Miller came to see me today, quite concerned. 
 He said your husband interrogated him, and his questions suggested a knowledge he shouldn't have of the list. 
 Let me talk to him. 
 I think we're past the point of conversation, Moira. 
 A month ago you came to me and you told me to stay away from your family, and I did. 
 But your family isn't staying away from me. 
 Which means something must be done about it. 
 Don't you agree? 
 Yes, I do. 
 And I'll handle it. 
 I guess what I'm wondering is, whether it's time for our associate to handle it. 
 Hell, yeah, I returned the money. 
 $70 million isn't worth getting an arrow through the chest. 
 And you can tell him, if he's got a problem with that, he can-- 
 [thwack thwack] 
 Commissioner, this is Nelson Ravich. 
 The Hood hit him earlier this week. 
 Ravich wired back the money he embezzled less than 5 minutes later. 
 All right. 
 We tell the press the Hood did this. 
 Hunt's murder is a page 10 story, at best. 
 But Ravich makes this a serial murder case. 
 We can't let the public get wind of the idea that there are two of these nut jobs running around. 
 You want me to ignore a serial killer. 
 Just catch one of these psychos. 
 I don't care which one. 
 That is a direct order from your commanding officer. 
 Well, you can forget it, then. 
 Fine. 
 It's forgotten. 
 And you're off this case, Sergeant, effective immediately. 
 [Ringing] 
 Don't bother trying to trace this back to me. 
 You'll never make it through the encryption. 
 There's a heating vent on the corner of O'Neil and Adams. 
 You'll find what you're after there. 
 It'd be a mistake to set a trap for me, Detective. 
 I'm trading away just about everything I believe in here 'cause it's the only way I've got to get this b*st*rd. 
 You got till Christmas. 
 And then, copycat or not... 
 I'm coming after you. 
 So your friend Lance gave you a Christmas present after all. 
 Hmm. 
 Teflon-coated titanium blade serrated to split the bone. 
 Shaft is some type of specialized polymer, which is stronger than a typical carbon fiber. 
 This...this is a custom job. 
 So Lance gave in after after the other archer dropped another body. 
 Nelson Ravich. 
 Which is another name you crossed off your dad's list. 
 So is this guy trying to frame you or call you out? 
 Either way, I need to find him. 
 
 
 
 Oh. 
 Hey. 
 [Gasps] Don't you knock? 
 Felicity, this is the I.T. department. 
 It's not the ladies room. 
 Right. 
 What can I do for you? 
 My buddy Steve is really into archery. 
 Apparently it's all the rage now. 
 I don't know why. It's looks utterly ridiculous to me. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Anyway, it's Steve's birthday next weekend, and I wanted to buy him some arrows. 
 The thing is, he gets these special custom-made arrows, and I have no idea where he gets them. 
 I was hoping you could find out where this came from. 
 Careful. 
 Yeah. 
 The shaft's composite is patented. 
 And that patent is registered to a company called Sagittarius. 
 That's Latin for the archer. 
 Really? 
 Could you find out where and when this was purchased? 
 According to Sagittarius company records, that particular arrow was part of a bundle shipment. 
 200 units. 
 Sent... to this address. 
 Felicity... 
 You're remarkable. 
 Thank you for remarking on it. 
 And Merry Christmas. 
 I'm Jewish. 
 Happy Hanukkah. 
 The significant resources of the Starling City police department is clear that this vigilante's cycle of violence has escalated. 
 I'm asking our citizens to keep a close eye out and to report anything suspicious. 
 A tip line has been set up, and a reward will be offered to anyone who aids the authorities in the capture of this madman. 
 It isn't him, is it? 
 We are all frustrated with the crime plaguing our city. 
 The man in the hood didn't kill those people. 
 You're the one who said he was a monster. 
 He was protecting me. 
 It's different. 
 ...the apprehension of this so-called "Hood" that has been terrorizing our city. 
 [Knock on door] 
 As police commissioner... 
 It's probably Joanna. 
 She said she was going to come by with some files. 
 Merry Christmas, sir. 
 How are you? 
 Proficient with firearms. 
 Dad. 
 Yeah. 
 I told you I wanted to spend the holidays with my dad. 
 Right. Because of Sara. 
 Because it makes the holidays a tough time. 
 But when you are with someone, as I want to be with you, then there aren't tough times. 
 There's just times. 
 Something is holding you back. 
 The Queens are having a last-minute Christmas party, and I would like for you to be my plus one. 
 I, um, was looking through some old photographs and...I found this. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Bad enough you're friends with this guy, and now he's your...what? 
 I don't know what he is. 
 But he's not wrong. 
 Something is holding me back. 
 Right. Keep listening to that something. 
 I try to stay out of your personal life, Laurel, I really do, but these guys-- 
 Merlyn, Queen-- 
 I mean, they're selfish. 
 They think they can treat people any way they damn please. 
 It's you, me, and Sara. 
 What? 
 [Thunder] 
 [Door slams] 
 [Zapping] 
 [Music playing] 
 I see the halls are decked. 
 You okay? 
 I'll manage. 
 Is everyone having a good time? 
 You sure you want to do this, man? 
 Maybe now is not the best time for you to be Martha Stewart's elf. 
 My family needs this party, Diggle. 
 Which means that I need it. 
 Hey, dude. 
 Thea invited me. 
 I hope that's cool. 
 These are for your mom. 
 Smooth. 
 Good luck, kid. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Oliver. 
 You guys look great. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Let's get a holiday photo. 
 I already sent out our Christmas cards, Oliver. 
 Mom, let's get a picture just for the 4 of us. 
 Of course. 
 Excuse me. Mrs. Queen? 
 These are for you. 
 Well, thank you. 
 I'll--I'll go put this in water. 
 Is everything all right? 
 You and I should talk alone. 
 Everything okay between the two of you? 
 Yeah. I'm sure it'll work itself out. 
 So glad that both of you could make it. 
 Merry Christmas, man. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Hi. 
 So how long do you guys think it'll be till this isn't so weird? 
 You know, the 3 of us. 
 It's not weird at all. 
 [All laugh] 
 You lied to me. 
 An odd accusation coming from you. 
 When you came home, you said you were through investigating Robert's death. 
 Robert was my oldest friend. 
 Do you take me for a man who wouldn't avenge his best friend's murder? 
 I thought I could forget about it, go back to the way things were. 
 But you told me too many lies, Moira. 
 You embezzled money from the company. 
 Salvaged the Queen's Gambit. 
 Why, Moira? 
 What was it all for? 
 For leverage. 
 Against whom? 
 Against whom? 
 People who you made very angry. 
 Well, then let me help you fight them. 
 I can't fight them. 
 I am them. 
 I have tried so hard to convince myself that I'm not. 
 And loving you... 
 You were my salvation. 
 Moira. 
 Moira. 
 Whatever you've done, and whoever these people are, the time for lies is over. 
 You need to tell me exactly what's going on. 
 Let's just get through the party... 
 And I promise I will tell you everything. 
 Hmm. 
 Tommy, do you mind if I talk to Oliver for a minute? 
 Yeah, I'll go grab us a couple drinks. 
 And drink them both. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I know it's probably not easy for you to see Tommy and I together. 
 Ah, the invitation said "plus one", not minus Laurel. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I've been wanting to move forward with him, but something's been holding me back. 
 I keep making these excuses; that it's my dad, it's my work, when really... it's you. 
 But for five years, I was emotionally... off, because you had died. 
 And the truth is, the last person that I expected to make me feel again... has. 
 I'm happy. 
 For both of you. 
 Thank you.

 [rock music playing] 
 Thea, it's Ollie. 
 Oliver! 
 Hit the road. 
 What are you doing? 
 Funny, I was going to ask you the same thing, because there's a party going on downstairs that I threw for you. 
 I told you, I didn't want a party. 
 But you didn't care. 
 Because you came down with the holiday blues. 
 I've been trying to get you to open up for months. 
 All this party is doing is bringing back memories I've been trying to forget. 
 Thea! 
 Why would you want to forget? 
 No matter how fancy the party is you throw, things will never be the way they used to be in our family. 
 Ever again. 
 Oliver? 
 What is it now? 
 The other archer's moved to the next level. 
 This just hit the news. 
 He's taken hostages. 
 Happy holidays, Starling City. 
 For the past three months, this city has been laid siege by a vigilante. 
 But the police have been unable to bring him to justice because they lack the will to do what justice demands. 
 [Sobbing] 
 I will kill one hostage... every hour in the name of this vigilante until he surrenders himself to my authority. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Police are on the scene, Oliver. 
 I think you should let them handle this. 
 Those people are there because of me. 
 I have to end this. 
 Oliver, this guy... this guy, he's very dangerous. 
 Diggle, there wasn't anything on the island that wasn't twice as dangerous as this pretender, and I survived there for five years. 
 [Static] 
 Call your people. 
 Tell them to bring the plane. 
 There's no need, Yao Fei. 
 My people will be here shortly. 
 Do you not think it convenient you captured me so easily? 
 Go! 
 What? 
 Run! 
 [All grunting] 
 Starling City holds its breath as the hostage crisis unfolds. 
 Police have attempted to enter the abandoned structure in the Glades, but found rigged explosives preventing them from doing so. 
 At the moment, there's been no sign of the vigilante as his one hour deadline nears. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 [Sighs] 
 I count three thresholds, each wired by Mercury switches to Semtex charges. 
 Can you defuse one for HRC to use as a breach point? 
 Well, that's going to take a while and then he's going to know which way we're coming in. 
 You got a better idea, Sergeant, now would be a lovely time. 
 Where is he? 
 I don't know. 
 It's going to be okay. 
 Follow me. 
 Get up on the roof. 
 What about... 
 I'll handle him. 
 Move! 
 Hostages. 
 We've got five hostages on the roof. 
 Repeat, five hostages on the roof. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 After the warehouse, I knew I'd have to do something dramatic to get your attention. 
 What do you want with me? 
 What any archer wants-- to see who's better. 
 First Hunt, then Ravich, and now you. 
 I know about the list, and the man who authored it wants you dead. 
 They call you the Hood. 
 Let's see what you look like without it. 
 [Both grunting] 
 [Coughing] 
 Dig. [Coughing] 
 Help--help. 
 Hey, relax. 
 Relax. Just relax. 
 You're safe. 
 You're in the hospital. 
 [Exhales] 
 What happened? 
 I back traced your signal. 
 I cleaned you up and got you out of there. 
 You've got a pneumothorax, three broken ribs and a concussion, but the doctor said you're going to be fine. 
 Some people are here to see you. 
 What? 
 [Exhales] 
 Are you all right? 
 Oh, God, you look terrible. 
 Well, thank God you were wearing your helmet. 
 I told them how you were on a bike and a semi pulled right in front of you. 
 What were you even doing out? 
 You bailed on your party. 
 It seemed like the right move. 
 I mean, like you said, it...wasn't the best timing. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, but when I was saying that, that was me being a bitch. 
 Oh, the truth is, I don't think any of us were at our best. 
 The real truth is, you wanted to have a party to bring us closer together. 
 Well... here we are. 
 [Chuckles] Ahh! 
 We're going to let you get some rest, hmm? 
 So... 
 We never got to the exchanging presents part. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I don't think I deserve a present. 
 Look, I know that I've been hard on you, about being different from the way you were. 
 But the truth is, Ollie, I'm not the same person I was five years ago, either. 
 So maybe we can just accept each other. 
 Not for who we were, but for the-- for the people we are now. 
 Yeah. 
 Ohh! 
 No cheating. 
 You're on. 
 Come here. 
 Aww. 
 Thank you, Felicity. 
 It was good of you to call, but Oliver's going to be fine. 
 He's already on the mend. 
 I'm stepping into an elevator, so I'll probably lose you. 
 I'll call you straight back. Bye. 
 It's done. 
 And he won't be harmed? 
 Nor will he ever discover your involvement. 
 You have my word. 
 Forgive me if I don't find that comforting. 
 You were warned, Moira. 
 I told you to get Walter under control, and you couldn't. 
 Steps had to be taken. 
 That's what you said to justify Robert's murder. 
 And you wonder why I don't trust you. 
 Quite a bid of judgment coming from the woman who had her son kidnapped and tortured. 
 To prove to you that Oliver didn't know anything. 
 And what does it matter now? 
 What's done is done. 
 No, Moira. 
 It's just beginning. 
 In six months, the organization's vision of what this city should be will be complete. 
 And you won't feel a thing then, will you? 
 Thousands of innocent people will be dead, and you'll feel nothing. 
 That's not true. 
 I'll feel a sense of accomplishment. 
 And you'll have Walter back. 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Exhales] 
 [Oliver groaning] 
 You know, Dig, when I confront somebody on the list, I tell them that they failed the city. 
 But tonight, it was me who failed. 
 Oliver, five hostages are home tonight with their families enjoying the holidays. 
 Because of you. 
 This guy, the other archer... 
 He'll get his. 
 And you'll give it to him. 
 We might have a bigger problem. 
 The other archer told me that somebody compiled the list. 
 I always assumed it was my father. 
 But what if it wasn't? 
 What do you mean? 
 I think there's someone else out there. 
 Someone who's more of a danger than the archer. 
 And I am going to take him down.
