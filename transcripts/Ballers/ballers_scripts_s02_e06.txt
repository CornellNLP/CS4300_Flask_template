You're gonna try to make it work out long distance? I mean, assuming that Tracy gets the job. Don't let my past cloud your judgment about me. I'm a different man. My friend, you haven't had a monogamous relationship last longer than six months in your entire life. And you're gonna put 1,200 miles of space between the two of you? I'm gonna start counting days before that side piece shows up. Thanks a lot for the vote of confidence. Real f*cking inspiring. Well, you're hitting the Don Julio a little hard. You know, I'm assuming that you're still self-medicating. When'd you become my guru all of a sudden? Huh, Swami Antolotti? You know, we're not talking about me. Think about that for a second. When was the last time you were locked down with a woman for more than a couple of months? Don't start. Huh? You know why? Because you have intimacy issues. (LAUGHS) Yeah, right. I have intimacy issues. You should look deeper into that psychological sh1t and you should give your f*cking shrink a raise. Okay. sh1t. (LAUGHING) Oh, sh1t. Excuse me, can you turn the TV up, please? Oh, this can't be good. Mark Schlereth :  Listen, I'm not a big fan of the combine. It's really not a test of your football ability, but more of your athleticism. But after his no-show at the combine,  who knows if Travis Mack can even run? Right now I've got him going second round on my big board. Given his inability to prove that he's not a total head case, he could fall even further. Only begs the question, who the hell is representing this train wreck? Now let's take a look at my sure thing. Excuse me, Don, could I have one more, please? Hang on, he's a major pain in the ass, but second round? Second round? No. That's a f*cking travesty. I'll call Schlereth tomorrow. Can I have some, too? Oh, you know Mark? Yeah, we burned some time trolling for marlin. Is that code for something? No, he's just straight up my fishing buddy. I'm gonna go see if I can take care of this sh1t. (KNOCKS) Morning, Mr. Siefert. Charles, have a seat. Hungry? I can always eat. Must be nice not having to worry about staying in shape. Eh, I got a newborn to chase around. It's not like I can exactly let myself go. 24/7, Charles. 365 days a year. Yes, sir. Being a parent is a very serious responsibility. I'm talking about our job. That's what goes into 16 games a year. I'm ready. When I commit, I'm committed. Good. We're letting Kovac go. We're getting rid of Kovac? We're not here to make friends. Yeah, but you cut me to keep him. You said go smaller. We signed a nice athletic Pro Bowl tackle from KC. Kovac got to go. I want you to tell him. What? That gonna be a problem? Going from the Black Swan to the vulture circling his prey? Uh, no, sir. I can handle it. Good. Drop a dime and drop the bomb. You know, I should probably do it in person. It's just more respectful. I don't care if you do it from a hot-air balloon, Charles. Just get it done. Yes, sir. Wow, Bob Izumi over here. I'm the king of the ocean. Let's do this. Where's our boy Mack Attack? Good question. Okay.  (MUSIC BLARING) Ah. Ah. Ah, yeah. Well, let's go hook us some dolphins, fellas. Yeah, now Greenpeace is gonna hate him just as much as everybody else. Nice shirt. Nice haircut. Let's do this. (LAUGHS) All right, Spence, I'm confused, man. Is this for business or pleasure? A little bit of both. It's covert business. It's the art of doing business without doing any business at all. All right, well, who are we not doing business with? Mark Schlereth. f*ck no. That dude's trying to destroy my life, man. Hey, what we're hoping for today, and obviously it's a big-ass hope, is that he gets a little face time with you and he changes his opinion. We're gonna need that. It'll raise your stock. I belong in the top five, Spence. You and you told me that. And we're gonna get you in the top five. Right now, we win Mark over, things will move along a lot quicker, all right? So we got a job to do. Your part is you're just gonna be cool. No bullshit today. Just cool Travis. Top five better be worth it, baby. I'll just be myself. Good. No, don't be yourself. Be a better you. Mark Schlereth. Handsome son of a bitch, get out here. Hey. Buddy. Here's the man who's killed more tuna than StarKist. How are you, Spence? Let me get that. Good. I'm good. It's good to see you. You remember Jason Antolotti. Of course. Jay. Mark. Hair's on fleek as always. I appreciate that. You know, late night last night, but luckily she never tells the tale. (LAUGHS) Amen. This here's Travis Mack. Travis, it's a pleasure to meet you. Heard a lot about you. Anything good? Yeah, Spence has said a few nice things. Has he? Then why are you sh1tting all over me, man? Travis. No, seriously, I read all the articles and stuff. And do you really think I have small hands? I mean, look. Do those hands look small to you? Take a look at that one. Spence. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. You know what? This is a great idea. Knock it the f*ck off. You got to forgive my client. He's an acquired taste. Yeah, kind of like motor oil. We're gonna hit reset right now and just get to know each other. You're both players. No, he's a has-been. Let's just get that right. Has-been. Listen, kid, you ain't dropped a squirt of piss in a bucket yet. We'll be right up. What are you doing? What are you doing? You gonna sabotage this whole thing before we even push off? That man has played 12 years in the league. He's won three Super Bowls. Get yourself together and show some goddamn respect for a guy who has paved the way. (SIGHS) (MUSIC PLAYING) Dennis :  You don't know dick about no lifestyle. Ttd :  I know Ricky gonna like New Orleans way more than he gonna like Buffalo. Everybody knows that. Even Bella said that. Dennis :  What the f*ck he care what that girl said? You know he care what Bella said. Y'all still sitting in the same spot talking the same sh1t, huh? It's about the dollars there, Ricky. I mean, that's what they're offering you in Buffalo. I mean, you can't be wearing that Liberace-ass robe up there in no family town. I'm telling you, man, you gonna need some terry cloth. The old man right about the robe, but he been hating on New Orleans all morning. Hey. Hating-ass nigga. Tyrod Taylor is ripping it the f*ck up in the NFL and TTD talking about he don't like no black quarterback. A brother hating on a brother for being a brother. No, I said I don't like no quarterback wearing no elbow pads. I don't give a f*ck if you're red, green or brown. That m*therf*cker afraid of getting hurt. That's all I'm saying. Both y'all need to mind your business. Hey, man, the clock is ticking. I'm gonna take as long as I need to to make a decision. Hell, I might not want to leave at all. Are you f*cking crazy? Miami squatted and took a sh1t on your face  when they offered that contract to Alonzo. Come on, man. Look, Rick, you need to shut out all this noise, okay? Clear out the Funhouse for you. You go over there and think peacefully. No distractions. Genius. Yeah. Appreciate that. You know what I mean? That's what I'm here for, baby. f*ck Miami, f*ck New Orleans, and get it out your skull! You hear me, Ricky?  (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTER) Woman :  Joseph. Yes. So glad you could make it. Anna, you have not changed a bit since I last saw you. So you're saying I'm still shit-faced and slurring my words? (LAUGHS) No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. Two shots of 1942 chilled for me and this very handsome man. You got it. Thank you. So whose house is this anyway? (GLASSES CLINK) An old business associate of mine. Well, he's killing it. You know him. Andre Alan. (LAUGHS) What? You're not f*cking joking. sh1t. Oh, man, you know what? You know what? Maybe it's not such a good idea that I'm here. Don't be silly. Andre's the one who asked me to invite you. I am right here for you. You can do this. (EXHALES)  (MUSIC PLAYING)  (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (MASK SQUEAKS) f*ck. I hate this sh1t. f*cking little brats. (SIGHS) (DOORBELL RINGS) Who are you? I'm Charles Greane. Is your daddy home? Dad, the Black Swan is here. Sorry for dropping by unannounced. You know, looks like I could've caught you at a bad time. Don't be silly. I always got time for the Black Swan. Huh, wow. This is a great cave, Nick. Yeah? Every dad needs one. Keeps you sane. (LAUGHS) How's your little girl doing? Kiki? Oh, she's great. Great, yeah. Growing and growing. (LAUGHS) It goes fast. Lydia turns six today. I saw. Big old birthday party out there. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You want something to drink? No, no. No, I am okay. Man, I still can't even believe it. My little girl looks up at me with those eyes, bro,   my heart just melts, you know what I mean? She has your eyes. I mean, luckily she got released from the hospital today  or we had to cancel this birthday party. The hospital? Asthma, man. Bad asthma. But the pediatrician says we got it under control for now. Well, that's a relief. I thank God every day for that wonderful doctor here in Miami, Charles. I don't know what I would do without her. Well, at least you got that one handled. For the time being. But you never know with asthma. What you want to talk to me about again, man? 
 
 (MUSIC PLAYING) Travis :  Ahoo! (LAUGHS) Whoo! Nobody's ever happy unless I got them going number one. No, I know, I get it. Okay, but Khalil Mack, Luke Kuechly, he should be picked accordingly. Then why didn't he go to the combine? They did? Jeez, the combine, the combine. That's all you guys ever talk about. Hey, have a pacifier. Dude, listen, he was double and triple-teamed, okay, all season long, he still wreaked havoc. He's a football player, okay? He's not a workout warrior. All right? Not like you, like a big workout warrior, man. Come on, his strength is functional. Functional? That's where we're going, functional. You and I both know that's an excuse for guys who can't lift. Hey, the underwear Olympics just wasn't the right play for him. Thank you, Jason. Okay. So take Vontaze Burfict, Terrell Suggs, yours truly, we all had horrible combines and went on to have a pretty good career, right? By the way, you weren't even invited to the combine. He overcame that for three Super Bowls. You know you cannot measure a professional football player that way. I get it, man. Nobody gets it better than I do. But I make my picks based on the information I have. Give me more information, maybe you'll get a different result. Now, you want to fish or you want to f*ck around? All right, fair enough. Let's fish. Come on. All right, this is gonna be a long day. I think we need to up the drinks. Jason : This isn't water, buddy. So, how'd he take it? Uh, o-okay, I guess. I'm sure he preferred hearing it from you, not from Siefert. Baby, nobody want to hear that news. Not one player. It's all so sad. Did you know little Lydia has got asthma?  She does? Yes, and they love their doctor. Hard to find. Whole thing just makes me want to cry. (SIGHS) You didn't tell him, did you? I couldn't.  (SCOFFS) I couldn't. I couldn't do it. Charles, this is not your decision. Just like it wasn't your decision when they decided to cut your ass. If you don't tell him, Siefert will. Turn the car around. Good to see you. Reed will listen to anything you say to him. Joseph Krutel. Andre. Good to see you without your bodyguard. Well, I wish I could say the same for you. Oh, Martin. He came with the house. Ah, well, what a great house it is. A little small for my tastes, you know? No place to land my jet. Why don't we have a drink in private? There's a couple things I want to talk to you about. Yeah, sure. Why not? Ahem. If something happens to me, tell Spencer it wasn't an accident. Okay? Okay. Hello. My name is Ricky. (SPEAKS HEBREW) You have a beautiful country. (SPEAKING HEBREW) (WOMEN GIGGLE) Sh-- great Negro Jesus! Hi. I didn't know anybody was here. We just arrived. I'm Natalie. I'm Jenna. I'm Ricky. We know who you are. So what are you doing, Ricky? Learning Hebrew. Planning on making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Get my pray on. Where y'all ladies from anyway? New Orleans. Oh. TTD put you up to this. Yeah, well, he figured we could help you make a decision. New Orleans has some of the best Baptist services in the South. Perfect for a man of faith. And I have some great real estate contacts. I can get you a sick place to live. Huh. So you ladies are like the board of tourism in bikinis. (LAUGHS) Something like that. Let's talk real estate. Come on up. Watch yourself. (REEL WHIRRING) Oh, there he is. The big one. Atta boy. Spencer :  Come on, Mark. (LAUGHS) Kicking your ass, Travis. Pay attention, ladies. You might just learn something. I told you I'd bag one first, Travis. Ah, now I know where Ricky gets his big mouth from. Mark :  You owe me a hundred. They just pulled his offer. You f*cking serious? When it's over, it's over, pal. It ain't yours unless you get it in the boat. Where the hell's he going? Travis.  I'm going to get the fish. Don't get the fish. The fish is fine. Get back in the boat. Hey, the world doesn't care if you can manhandle a sailfish. They want to know how fast he can run. Khalil ran a 4.65. Luke a 4.58. What you got under the hood, Travis? Hey, he can run a 4.6 anywhere, anytime. How about right now? I'll bet you 1,000 bucks he can do it right now. After a six-pack of beer? You're on. Uh-- uh, I thought today was like leisure day. Captain Dave. Just need 40 yards of dry land. Thank you, buddy. Put the knife away. Stretch. You're gonna run. What I really want is a place with that Southern Goth style. Don't give me no haunted house. You know New Orleans got a lot of ghosts, right? We can manage that. And all your church work will ward off any evil spirits. (CHUCKLES) Hallelujah. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, man. I can't get no peace around here. Excuse me. Shalom, Jason. I got some not such good news for you, Ricky. The Saints pulled their offer. What the f*ck for?  Well, it's your old man. What's Dennis got to do with this? Why don't you go check his Twitter feed? Hold on. That overbearing m*therf*cker! I'll call you back, Jason. What the--? You're doing a great job at ASM. I wish I could take all the credit, but it's a team effort. Not from where I'm sitting. You are the only commodity that they have. Spencer, you know, he's masquerading as a finance manager. Why don't you come join my team? Is that why you had Anna invite me? Ah, wait, you didn't have the nerve to do it yourself? Or maybe you thought I'd turn you down. That never happens. I'm offering you a way out. $500,000 a year. You're making 350 as a base salary at ASM. How the f*ck do you know what I make? I've built an empire on information. Well, kudos for doing your homework. Spencer is just a pretty facade. You are the mechanism that moves that machine. Come work for me. Don't let him keep you down. I'll think about it. Enjoy the party. Take your time. Mull it over. Mi casa, su casa. Come on, honey. Let's go. Let's go. Woman :  It's okay, baby. Kovac :  God damn it!  f*ck! I'm sick of this sh1t. Lydia :  Daddy's going crazy. Kovac :  I bought this f*cking stupid-ass pool. Stupid-ass house. f*ck! (CHILDREN SCREAM) Charles, thank God you're here. You have to talk to him. Oh, sh1t.  What the f*ck is going on? God damn it! f*cking lying-ass m*therf*cker. Lying-ass m*therf*cker! Lie to me like this! What's up, Charles? I didn't expect to see you back so f*cking fast. Hey, Nick. Everything okay? Do I look f*cking okay, Charles? Huh? I just finished reconstruction on this sh1t. They're supposed to fill it next week. I guess that's just not gonna f*cking happen, right? Huh? How'd you find out? You was acting so f*cked up, I just went ahead and called f*cking Siefert. And he broke the news down for me the only way that he knows how. Like an asshole? Exactly. I'd have preferred to hear it from you, big man. I'm sorry I hadn't had the guts to tell you earlier, all right? But your sting will pass. You're young and you're gonna land somewhere that really needs you and you're gonna play in this league for a long-ass time. You got to trust me. I've been around long enough to know. But you got to believe it. In your heart. I'm trying, man. For my family. Well, then you got to be strong for them. Right? Man, you're Nick Kovac. They can't tell you sh1t. Right? f*ck Siefert. Thanks, man. How you know I needed that? I didn't. sh1t, that was for me. (LAUGHS) He gonna run today or what? You got this? Yeah, I got it. What the f*ck? It calms my nerves, man. Listen to me. You got this. You really think so? Yes, I do. (SIGHS) Dennis! This fucking-- Dennis! Dennis! Where the f*ck you at? What make it so difficult for you to call me Dad? Have you lost your simple-ass mind? 'Cause of you, New Orleans pulled their offer. New Orleans? f*ck New Orleans, man. Hey, look, Buffalo is where the money is. Oh, what, Buffalo got you on payroll now? Oh, come on, Ricky. It's only your interests that I got at heart. Oh, now you want to be a hands-on parent, right? It's better late than never, man. Come on. I'm 30 years old. School is out. You missed it. Maybe I missed it, but maybe it's that little piece of ass Bella that makes you not want to leave. Disrespect her, motherfucker-- Get your hands off me. f*ck that! You little mother-- God damn it. Time you pay your daddy some motherfucking respect. Is this for real or are you niggas play-fighting? Dennis :  f*ck you!  (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTER) Nothing. Boring. sh1t. Yeah. f*ck, Andre. Hey. I was looking for the bathroom. Mmm. That's not it. I hope you didn't soil my rug. (LAUGHS) No, no. I'm totally housebroken. But you probably knew that, right? Well, I wasn't sure. Well, I am. So case closed. Hey, um, while you're here, I've been thinking about your offer and I'm gonna have to respectfully decline. It's very generous and thank you. It really is, but... sadly, I'm more loyal than I am ambitious. Well, I am sorry to hear you say that. Well, there's a first time for everything, right? Mm-hmm. Well, but great party. The food, Anna, drinks, really, really fun day. Thank you. Uh, there's something I forgot to mention. Your partner lost quite a bit of money a while back. The kind of money that would raise even the wealthiest of eyebrows, not to mention clients. Yeah, I don't know anything about it. I know you don't, but the NFLPA does. Which makes me wonder, if Spencer doesn't trust you enough to tell you the truth about his past, how could you possibly trust him with your future? Boy, something to think about, huh? Mm-hmm. For the drive home. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Got to go. Don't forget to use the bathroom first. I'll hold it. (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUN FIRES) ♪ Dance to the beat of the living dead ♪
