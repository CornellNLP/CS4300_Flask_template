 Previously on "Heartland"... 
 Lou, this is Mackenzie Hutton. 
 I'm not on a diet. I'm allergic. 
 Allergic to what? 
 Dairy, white sugar, seafood, gluten. 
 Ow. There's mosquitoes! 
 I'd rather marry my real-estate broker than be with the moron that you've wasted your last five years with. 
 How we doing tonight? Not interrupting anything, am I? 
 My bodyguard has the night off. 
 I don't know what Mindy told you, but whatever it was, it isn't true. 
 I don't know why it matters. 
 I mean, everyone knows you're with Kit. 
 Where's the nearest gluten-free bakery? 
 Hey. Did you get the gluten-free bread? 
 I did. 
 And the all-natural spring water? 
 Yes. Mackenzie will be able to take in food and water. 
 This time, I am prepared for all of her neuroses. 
 Man, you know, I can't believe she's marrying that real-estate guy. 
 She's not. 
 Excuse me? 
 She broke up with him. 
 Oh. And she's engaged to someone else since she's been here? 
 Yeah, I know. Pretty fast. 
 You know, I don't know how anyone could live happily ever after with her. 
 She is not all bad. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay, she's a nightmare. 
 But she wants to get married here, and I am not about to turn away her business. 
 Besides, I'm happy for her. 
 I mean it! 
 Okay, so, maybe I don't mean it. 
 Excuse me if I'm a little bit jaded, but the idea of planning a Heartland wedding and building a little love nest right now makes me want to barf. 
 How does it look? 
 She sure is something. 
 An Andalusian. 
 The preferred mount of kings. 
 Really? I don't remember ever riding a horse like this. 
 Well, Amy, here she is in all her glory. 
 Hello. How you doing, girl? 
 Oh, be careful. She has been known to bite. 
 She's beautiful. 
 Yep, she's beautiful, all right. 
 People fall for her immediately. 
 And then as soon as someone buys her, they return her. 
 This is her third return. 
 Why do they bring her back? What's wrong with her? 
 Oh, she's cursed. 
 So, why cursed? 
 My husband Dan and I bought her when she was a yearling. 
 And, I swear, that horse is one of the main reasons why he is now my ex-husband. 
 Just coping with the animal was the last straw that ruined my marriage. 
 We called her Diva Girl, the divorce horse. 
 I'm not kidding. I mean it. 
 Whoever's on her has ended up in divorce court. 
 I think she's cursed. 
 Luckily, I don't need a cursed horse to ruin my relationships. 
 I do that just fine on my own. 
 Oh. 
 Well, here comes the bride. 
 Did you have a good trip? 
 Yeah, the usual craziness. 
 Ian missed his flight. 
 His cab got in an accident on the way to LaGuardia. 
 Oh, no. Is he okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. He's fine. No worries. 
 All right, well, hey, let me just help you with your luggage Oh, no bags. They lost all of them. 
 No! 
 Yep. Including the one with my wedding dress in it. 
 Oh, well, you know what? You're here. 
 So we're in good shape, right? 
 Yeah, whatever. I'm fine. 
 Really? 
 Amy. 
 Oh, my God, what a beautiful horse. 
 Careful. Apparently, she bites. 
 No, he likes me. 
 That is so cute. 
 She. It's a girl. 
 That horse can smell a wedding a mile away. 
 It's the curse at work already. 
 ♪  And at the break of day  ♪ 
♪  You sank into your dream  ♪ 
♪  You dreamer  ♪ 
♪  You dreamer  ♪ 
♪  You dreamer  ♪ 
 You know, I don't see what her problem is. 
 She seems pretty responsive. 
 She's on her best behavior. 
 She'll act one way one day and then completely differently the next. 
 It's like she's got a split personality. 
 My mom called that being "marish." 
 Well, then, she's marish. 
 But she's a prizewinner, and she is worth a lot of money. 
 So your mission, should you wish to accept it, is to figure out her moods and then work your magic so that the next lucky owners don't bring her back in a few months. 
 Well, I will try. 
 Get rid of the curse if you can while you're at it. 
 Oh, and, Amy, you can ride her and lunge her, but keep her stabled. 
 Because if she's out in the field, she'll get dirty and kicked, and she really has to look great if I'm gonna sell her. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Of course, smooches. Do the best you can. 
 I miss you, too. 
 Bye. 
 He's gonna try to get here tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 No fiancé and no luggage. 
 Can only get better, right? 
 What? 
 No offense, but the old Mackenzie would be having a total meltdown right now. 
 Oh, that Mackenzie's gone. 
 Ah, Lou, I'd forgotten how gorgeous it is here. 
 When I told Ian about this place, we just both knew we wanted to get married here. 
 That's sweet. 
 You know where I want it to happen? 
 Right there. Looking out over the lake at sunset. 
 That would be perfect. 
 It'll just be a beautiful, simple wedding. 
 No New York craziness. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 I promise to make it a day that you will always remember. 
 Now, sit down. 
 I want you to tell me all about this new fiancé. 
 He's my hero. 
 He's my rock. 
 And he's gorgeous. 
 Is that all? 
 I used to want to control everything all the time, you know, and Ian just makes me feel... 
 ...spontaneous. 
 How about you? You got someone special? 
 Uh, no. Not right now. 
 I'm okay with it. 
 Mm, there's a person out there for you. 
 Somebody who's your other half, like Ian is for me. 
 I don't know... 
 Yes, there is. 
 Here's to finding that person. 
 Ooh, thank you. 
 Morning. 
 Where did Lou get to? 
 She drove Mackenzie back to the cabins. Why? 
 No reason. 
 Come on, now. 
 I know when there's something on your mind. 
 How do you think she's doing? 
 Good. 
 Pretty busy organizing this wedding thing. 
 She wasn't given much notice. Why? 
 She seems... 
 I don't know. 
 She seems fine to me. 
 You're a man. You're not gonna notice these things. 
 What things? 
 Well, her love life has been rocky lately. 
 And I don't like to play matchmaker, but I've been told that I am very good at it. 
 Stop right there. She does not need a matchmaker. 
 It's just that this friend of mine keeps describing this young man who sounds perfect for her. 
 Oh, don't go there. 
 [Sighs] 
 Girl. 
 So this is the famous Andalusian. 
 What's the deal with her? Other than the curse. 
 Well, apparently, she's very changeable. 
 People fall in love with her because she's so beautiful, and then she drives them crazy with her mood swings. 
 Beautiful woman, mood swings. 
 Plenty of experience with both of those. 
 Right. 
 [Horse grunts] 
 [Horse neighs] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Easy, girl. Easy, easy, easy. 
 You know, it's my fault. It's Spartan. 
 I mean, he's a gelding, and sometimes mares are a little antsy around geldings. 
 Why don't you calm him down? I'll take her out to the pen. 
 Okay. 
 Come here. Good boy. 
 Come on. 
 Nice manners! 
 Yeah. 
 I see you really have that moody, beautiful female thing down. 
 Hey, Jack, do you believe in curses? 
 My mom does. 
 She has this lucky necklace that she says wards off evil spirits. 
 Now she says it wards off evil booking agents. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Yes, she is. Right here. Hang on. 
 It's your mother. 
 Oh, my God! That is so spooky. 
 Hi. 
 We were just talking about you. 
 Really? That's great! 
 My parents are coming home! 
 What? 
 Oh, okay. 
 Bye. 
 What? 
 I thought both my parents were coming home, but just my mom is. 
 Well, that's nice. 
 No, it's weird. 
 Why would my mom be coming home alone? 
 They're never apart. 
 Something's going on. I know something is. 
 Nothing's going on, Mallory. She probably just misses you. 
 It's hard to believe, but stranger things have happened. 
 Hey. 
 Where have you been? 
 Every time I'm here, you're not. 
 It works both ways. 
 That wedding on Saturday, you know we're all invited. 
 You should come. It's gonna be a fun party. 
 You want me to be your wedding date? 
 Couldn't find anybody better? 
 Apparently not. 
 I don't do so well at weddings. I mean, they kind of choke me up. 
 I'm sure. 
 Besides, I mean, I'd have to buy a suit, right? 
 No, it's totally casual. You could just... 
 You could probably just go like that. 
 Maybe wash first. 
 You might want to do something about that hat head, too. 
 No, it's very attractive. 
 So, uhm... 
 Yes or no? 
 How about I get back to you on that? 
 That apple crumble was amazing, Lou. 
 Good. 
 Good to see you got your appetite back. 
 Oh, coffee, please. 
 Oh, you know what? It's not decaf. 
 It's okay. It's not a problem. 
 Okay. 
 My nutritionist is in total shock. 
 Ever since I met Ian, I don't have any allergies at all. 
 It's the weirdest thing. 
 I can eat and drink anything I want. 
 Wow. 
 The whole weekend here, it completely changed my life. 
 I went home, and I dumped my boyfriend, and I quit my job. 
 You did what? 
 I opened up a little art gallery in the Village. 
 Mackenzie, that's amazing. 
 Lou was my inspiration. 
 Oh, please! 
 Why work for somebody else when you can be your own boss? 
 Right? 
 Mackenzie, did you say your last name was Hutton? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Do you know Elspeth and Riley Penfield? 
 Oh, my God. They're my parents' best friends. 
 I've known them for years. 
 And I'm certain I've met your parents at something or another. 
 June and Ray. 
 Yes! It's crazy! 
 Wow, small world. 
 Mackenzie's parents, June and Ray Hutton, they are high society. 
 And I mean in the old sense of the word. 
 Central Park penthouse. They've got a place in the Hamptons. 
 Tiny wedding, Lou? I don't think so. 
 Mackenzie said she wants to keep it simple. 
 She may want to keep it simple, but simple by Hampton standards is 250 guests. 
 And I don't think they mean our kind of simple. 
 They mean elegant simple. 
 But don't worry. I know these people. 
 I am here to help. You can count on me. 
 Thanks, Lisa, but I have everything in hand. 
 I'm fine, really. 
 Are you sure you're fine? 
 Yeah, why wouldn't I be? 
 Well, I know you've had a difficult couple of months. 
 And this must be hard to have a friend fall in love and get engaged and get married right out here at Heartland. 
 I'm good with it. Really. 
 Okay. 
 So, I'm gonna say something, and you can tell me to back off totally as soon as you hear it, but there's this guy, and he's not only single, successful, but he sounds like he's extremely attractive, and I think he'd be perfect for you. 
 Excuse me? 
 Don't say I said anything. 
 Okay. 
 Mackenzie, I wanted to show you something. 
 You've made your guest list, haven't you? 
 Well, it's not totally settled yet. 
 I think Lisa just tried to set me up. 
 Oh. 
 Look at that. 
 Yeah, she's being normal. 
 Man, we're good. 
 We are good! 
 You know what? I've missed this. 
 Missed what? 
 Oh, good girl. 
 This. You know, working together. 
 It's just been kind of weird lately, like, with us, I mean. 
 What are you talking about? Speak for yourself. 
 What? This is not just about me. 
 Yeah, since when? 
 It isn't! 
 You're the one who's always acting weird, not to mention moody and... 
 And, yes? 
 Nice horse. 
 So, Amy, that wedding. 
 If you still haven't found anyone to take you, I'll do it. 
 Oh, I feel so special. Thanks, Caleb. 
 I've got a way. 
 Are you still going to the wedding with Kit? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 I am. 
 Good. 
 Hey, do you think she's had enough for now? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Are you around later to help me? 
 Absolutely. 
 Okay. 
 Um, Ty? 
 Yeah? 
 Am I moody and beautiful? 
 Shut up. 
 A barbecue? Are you serious? 
 It's not just a barbecue. 
 Marnie is gonna cater it. 
 Lou, that's still a barbecue. For a wedding? 
 This is what Mackenzie wants. A simple cookout. 
 Just like we had on the trail ride. 
 I'll bet you anything she has not run this by her parents. 
 You do know that there's a 40% chance of rain on Saturday? 
 I called these guys. 
 They did the tent at my last do, and they're really terrific. 
 And we need a tent because... 
 You want to seat people in the rain? 
 There is a 60% chance that it won't rain. 
 And anyways, Lisa, there aren't a lot of guests coming. 
 Just Mackenzie's close friends, her parents, and us, that's it. 
 Maybe 50. 
 If it rains, you want a tent. 
 You're missing the... 
 Well, it turns out there are not a lot of shopping choices in Hudson. 
 Have my bags arrived yet? 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 I'm just gonna have to get married in my jeans. 
 Well, hey, I have this great recipe to show you. 
 Grilled Asian spiced mango chicken. 
 Lou, there's an eensy change in plans. 
 I'm not sure about the barbecue. 
 Oh? 
 I just got off the phone with my mom, and she has her heart set on more, like, a sit-down thing. 
 Okay. 
 It's not what I wanted, but I mean, she's my mother. 
 I can't disappoint her. I'm her only daughter, like she reminded me about a hundred times. 
 Okay. 
 Well, Lou has thought of everything. 
 Take a look at this tent. 
 Wow. 
 And with all these little white twinkly lights, it could be heaven. 
 I love little white twinkly lights. That's so pretty. 
 So, what's the story today, Mom? Are you coming home or not? 
 Okay. I love you, too. 
 So, now my mom says she's trying to get home, but she can't get rid of the people that are renting our house. 
 Mom and Dad are somewhere north of Saskatoon. 
 Maybe I should just go and see them. 
 Maybe you shouldn't. 
 But, Jack, you don't understand. My mom sounds really sad. 
 What if...? 
 What if what? 
 What if my parents break up? What if they get a divorce? 
 What if the curse works long distance? 
 Oh, good gravy! 
 Stranger things have happened, Jack. 
 Good gravy. 
 She seems pretty wary. 
 I think she's just figuring out if he's going to hurt her. 
 Well, they're good for now. I got to get going, so... 
 Wait. I thought you said you were gonna help me. 
 Well, I am. I mean, I did. 
 I can't be here 24/7, Amy. 
 No one's expecting you to be. 
 I think she's almost enjoying this. 
 I swear it's that curse she has. 
 You think? 
 Yeah, look at her eyes. 
 She's totally getting to us. 
 Let's not let her. 
 All right, I'll help you when I get back, okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 There's that gorgeous horse. 
 Careful. She is in a mood. 
 Hi! 
 Oh, my God, I love this horse. Is it for sale? 
 Oh, a horse in New York? 
 No, I wouldn't keep him in New York. 
 Ian's family has a ranch in Montana. That's where he'd live. 
 Her. 
 Hello! 
 Look at these gorgeous wild flowers I got at the farmers' market. 
 I figure now that we have tables, we need centerpieces. 
 Cute. 
 Look at these. Aren't they gorgeous? 
 And they're Mackenzie's favorite roses. 
 You'll be glad to know I got a quote on the tent. 
 Really reasonable. 
 Okay. 
 What's this? Vickerton and Company? 
 The caterers. 
 Marnie is catering. 
 Lou, Marnie can make dogs and burgers for 50, but I don't think she has the experience or even the staff to serve 100 guests filet mignon medium. 
 Well, I'm glad you have everything in hand. 
 No worries. 
 I said I'd help, and I meant it. 
 Oh, there's one other thing I need to clear up with you. 
 It's about the young man I talked to you about. 
 So, here's the deal. 
 I gave your e-mail address to my friend, who, in turn, gave it to her friend because that friend has a fabulous relationship with a florist who has great prices on these tea roses. 
 And as it turns out... don't be mad... the friend of a friend gave the address to her son. 
 So, you gave out my personal information to a total stranger? 
 I'm sorry, but it had already happened by the time I found out. 
 There's a couple of pretty girls right there. 
 Hi. 
 Come on, come on. 
 You're okay. 
 Don't worry. Spartan's not here. 
 Good girl. 
 Well, thanks for the ride, Kit. 
 Come back here! 
 Okay. 
 See you. Thanks for helping me study. 
 No problem. Bye! 
 See you, Kit! 
 She bit me. 
 I don't know what got into her. 
 She was fine outside. She was calm, good-natured. 
 And then I brought her in, and it just happened so fast. 
 Ah! 
 Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 Maybe you should tell Lisa that this horse is a bit too much. 
 Well, no. I want to help her. 
 I mean, she's so angry. 
 Feel okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Can you not tell anyone about this? 
 Yeah. 
 Mackenzie! 
 Smoochie! 
 Baby! 
 Oh! 
 
 
 
 It's Ian! 
 Hi. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! 
 My belt! 
 Cabbie! 
 My belt! 
 Hey, my belt! 
 Hey! 
 Stop! You've got my belt! 
 Yeah, the last few weeks have been just a little bit crazy, actually. 
 But this ranch... 
 Wowwee. 
 Didn't I tell you? 
 Yeah. 
 Mackenzie couldn't stop going on about it. 
 My dad has a place, actually, in Montana, and we were gonna have the wedding there, but my stepmother got involved, and everything exploded. 
 So, I'm just really happy we chose this place. 
 I think you're going to love what we're doing. 
 There's going to be little white lights. 
 Wow, that's great. 
 And ivy and white roses that go all around the tent poles. 
 So, there's a tent? 
 Well, in case it rains. 
 You don't want to have to seat all those guests outside. 
 Right. All what guests? 
 Mom and Dad had a list. 
 How big is the list? 
 Under 100. 
 So, things kind of escalated a bit. 
 A bit? 
 Jack, is there more wine? 
 It's not organic. 
 Ah, it's okay. Just pour. 
 I'll actually take a finger or two of that, too, Jack. 
 [Computer chimes] 
 "Okay. I've never done this before, so bear with me. 
 Apparently, there are a few people out there who are totally convinced that we should get in touch. 
 Awkward. 
 But, hey, I'm all about fate. 
 I'm also all about putting fate in motion. 
 I hope you are, too. 
 Peter." 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! Let's go! 
 Come on! 
 [Horse neighs] 
 See ya. 
 See ya. 
 Okay, bye. 
 Bye. 
 She's a great girl, right? 
 She sure is. 
 She's the best. 
 If you hurt her, I'll have to kill you. 
 You know that, right? 
 Hey, Amy. How's it going? 
 Well, this horse is making me crazy. 
 She's just spoiled, that's all. 
 Turn her out with the rest of the horses. 
 Yeah, maybe she's been so micromanaged, she hasn't had time to just be a horse. 
 You should let her out. 
 I can't. 
 You know, Lisa told me to keep her inside, keep her... 
 Well, keep her clean. 
 Clean? 
 You see that? 
 Need my help, just ask. 
 Oh, Amy, we're going to Maggie's tonight. 
 You should come. 
 Honey, I can't afford this. 
 I mean, we can't afford this. 
 No, of course not. Relax. 
 My parents are paying for it. 
 Well, I thought we were gonna pay for it. 
 We were going to do it ourselves. 
 I know, but you know my folks. I'm their little girl. 
 Hey. 
 Hi, Lou. 
 So, listen, I just have some last-minute details to go over with the bride. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Seating. 
 How many replies have you received? 
 Oh. 
 152. 
 152? 
 You know my parents. 
 Honey, we sort of wanted something really simple right from the very beginning. 
 That's why you chose this place. 
 I mean, 'cause you had such an amazing time here. 
 And I mean, I love it here. Like, I love it. 
 Great. Me too. What's the problem? 
 There's no problem. 
 I'm not sure why we're having the same wedding here that we were trying to avoid back in the city. 
 I'm just trying to wrap my head around that. 
 You're not happy? 
 No. 
 I'm happy. I mean, I'm happy. 
 I'm surprised, that's all. 
 I'm sorry you feel that way. 
 Let's just rethink it a little bit. 
 Yeah, rethinking's good. 
 Rethink it? 
 Yeah. 
 What am I supposed to tell my parents? 
 We're gonna have burgers around a fire instead of filet under a tent with little white lights and tea roses? 
 Well, they're not the ones that are getting married, Mack. 
 Remember? We are. 
 Yeah, well, maybe we should rethink it and not have the wedding at all. 
 Okay, that's not where I was going. 
 Well, you did, and now it's ruined. Everything's ruined! 
 I will never be able to look back and have nothing but happy memories leading up to my day. 
 Oh, I see. So now it's "your" day. 
 It is always the bride's day, Ian. 
 Remember that when I'm standing there in the pouring rain, and my hair is plastered to my head like a wet seal, and my eye makeup is running down my face, and my beautiful dress is drenched into a white smooshy pulp all because you couldn't get your head around a canopy and a few tea roses! 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I can totally see where you're coming from. I do. 
 You do? 
 I do. I do. 
 Good. 
 Heard from your mother? 
 No. 
 I guess no news is good news. 
 I've made up my mind, Jack. 
 I'm not just gonna sit around and wait for a judge to tell me I'm with my mom from Monday to Thursday and with my dad from Friday to Monday. 
 Mallory, you are definitely overreacting to this. 
 Maybe, maybe not. 
 But a divorce curse is still a curse. 
 It doesn't matter if it's long distance or not. 
 I still have to be proactive. 
 How is that? 
 I got my ways. 
 Come here, girl. 
 Look what I got. 
 Curse, be gone. Curse, be gone. 
 Come on. 
 Curse, be gone. 
 You'll thank me later. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, I heard you have a cursed horse. 
 It would seem that way, yeah. 
 Well, we've been working with her, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I mean, she's a lot of work, but she's coming along, right? 
 And why is that? Huh? 
 What? You think you had something to do with it? 
 I'd say there's not a female on earth I couldn't figure out. 
 Ooh! 
 Oh! 
 Right. 
 Well, put her out in the field, I said. 
 Well, he actually did say that. That's right. 
 That's right. 
 Admit it. It was my call. 
 Okay, you may have helped a little bit. 
 Well, thank you. 
 You know Caleb does know his horses. 
 I swear I was a horse in another life. 
 Yeah, and then you came back as a horse's ass. 
 Careful. 
 There we go. 
 It's Ashley. I swear she calls me like 10 times a day. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, her mom's still driving her nuts. 
 Oh, poor baby. 
 Hey, I like her. She's a good kid. 
 It's off. 
 What's off? 
 The wedding. 
 Why? 
 Well, Ian doesn't love me, so... 
 What? 
 Better to know that now than later, so, it's a good thing in the long run. 
 Can I use your room? 
 I can't go back to the cabins right now. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Great. 
 I'm really itchy. Are there still mosquitoes? 
 Look, relax, okay? 
 You go and lay down in my room and relax. 
 Don't make any big decisions right now. 
 I like that restaurant. We should go there again. 
 What's wrong, Lou? 
 It's off. The wedding is off. 
 No! That's impossible. 
 Everybody is coming to set up tomorrow. 
 You know, I don't know why you're so surprised, Lisa. 
 Pardon? 
 You're the one who caused this whole problem in the first place. 
 Lou. 
 No, it's true, Grandpa. 
 Mackenzie and I, we were fine. 
 We were planning the wedding that she wanted. 
 The wedding that Ian wanted, too, but, no, you got involved, and everything just went off the rails. 
 Tents, flowers, caterers. 
 I was simply doing what Mackenzie wanted, what her parents expected. 
 No, Lisa, you were doing what you wanted. 
 You were interfering in my business. 
 And, oh, yes, let's not forget, in my life. 
 Giving out my e-mail address to some guy I don't even know because my love life is just so pathetic that you think I need your help. 
 Unbelievable! Like, who do you think you are? 
 It's just not fair. I was trying to help. 
 Well, don't, okay? 
 Because I don't need your help. 
 I don't want your help. 
 I don't know that I have ever been so disappointed in you. 
 So, I canceled all the invitations. 
 I'd pack, but I don't have anything to pack since my luggage never did arrive. 
 It was a sign right from the start. A bad omen. 
 Mallory. 
 It's okay. She's right. 
 Hey, do you want some coffee or something? 
 No, no. I think that's what's caused this rash I've got. 
 Do you have calamine lotion? 
 Yeah, in the bathroom under the sink. 
 Thank you. 
 It's all my fault. 
 I tried to remove the curse, but instead I think I just reversed it. 
 Mallory, there are no spells, okay? There are no curses. 
 This is not your fault. 
 Hey. 
 You're not leaving. 
 Looks like. 
 Ian, look, I'm so sorry. 
 Do you want me to talk to her? 
 No. No. The joke's over. 
 I knew it was too good to be true. 
 Did she tell you how we met? 
 No. 
 It's in Gramercy Park. 
 I never go to Gramercy Park, but I'm a graphic artist. 
 I decided to take my sketch pad and go and work there that day, and then this girl walks by with a dog, and the lyrics to Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl" actually went through my head, and her dog took off after a squirrel or something, and she started freaking out. 
 And I didn't think about it, I just went after the dog. 
 And I got him, and she was blown away. 
 She called me her knight in shining armor. 
 That's sweet. 
 Yeah, I always thought it was fate that we met. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 You know, If I hadn't changed my routine and gone to the park that day, I may never have seen her. 
 I guess it just goes to show you got to have the courage to break out of your routine and be spontaneous. 
 Seize the day. 
 Carpe diem. 
 That's our motto. 
 Well, it was our motto. 
 Good girl. 
 Well, I hate to say it, but I think Caleb was right. 
 I guess she just had to spend time being a horse. 
 I guess we did it. 
 Yeah, I guess we did. 
 You did it? I did it! I reversed the curse. 
 What curse? 
 Well, Lisa's horse. 
 No. It's nothing. 
 Hey, girl. 
 Hey, there. 
 Hey, Lisa. 
 Hi, guys. 
 Diva Girl. 
 Well, she certainly likes you, doesn't she? 
 Yeah. 
 I wish I could take her back to New York, but I can't. 
 See you, guys. 
 Yeah. 
 Why is she in the paddock with the other horses? 
 I thought I asked you to keep her stabled. 
 I know. 
 She hates being in a stall. 
 That's why she's moody, and that's why she bites. 
 Look at her. 
 She loves it out here just being a horse. 
 She's happy. 
 So, you're suggesting she not be a show horse. 
 Well, maybe. 
 I mean, she's just fine now as long as she's out with the other horses. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 No, I am glad. 
 I'm glad you finally figured her out. 
 Good work. 
 I guess I'll figure out what to do with her. 
 You are making a huge mistake. 
 Ian loves you. 
 He's heartbroken. 
 Really? 
 Where is he? 
 He left. 
 Ha. 
 Listen to me. 
 When you came out here, you knew exactly how you wanted to get married. 
 And then you got pushed in another direction. 
 But you know what? 
 Ian was strong enough to hold on to that dream. 
 To me, that's a guy worth keeping. 
 I know, but it's not gonna happen. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey. 
 I got your luggage here. 
 Thanks, Ty. 
 It's my dress. 
 It's beautiful and simple, just like the wedding was supposed to be. 
 Oh, Lou, I made a really big mistake. 
 Ian was right. 
 What am I gonna do? I ruined everything. 
 It's okay. We're gonna figure it out. 
 Is Mackenzie still around? 
 Mackenzie! 
 Mackenzie Hutton! 
 I want you out here right now! 
 I love you! 
 Go. 
 I will marry you wherever and whenever you want. 
 You can have 10 tents if you want. 
 You can invite anyone you want to. 
 It's too late for all that. 
 Everybody... Our parents have been uninvited. 
 Lou? 
 Yes? 
 Would you be my maid of honor? 
 I would love to. 
 Jack, would you be kind enough to give me away? 
 It would be my pleasure. 
 Then, yes, Ian Parsons, I will marry you! 
 Come here. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Baby? 
 Oh, God. 
 I'm all right. I'm all right. 
 Congratulations, man. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Here she comes. 
 Ian, today I join my life with yours. 
 Not just as your husband. 
 But as a confidant. 
 Your lover. 
 And your friend. 
 I will be the shoulder that you lean on. 
 The rock that you rest on. 
 And the companion of your life. 
 I promise to love and cherish you. 
 I will care for you and fight for you. 
 I will encourage you. 
 I will comfort you. 
 I will be myself with you. 
 And I will be myself with you. 
 Together, we will seize the day. 
 Carpe diem. 
 Carpe diem. I now pronounce you husband and wife. Turned out to be a beautiful ceremony. I'm glad. Just one thing missing. What can I say? She's beautiful. She's yours. What? Call it a wedding present. You're kidding. Mmm-mmm. No, Lisa, I couldn't possibly. Yes, you can. I want you to have her. And thanks to Amy, she's now well-behaved and she obviously has a very special affinity with you. Well, I love her, but I mean, she costs a lot. No. I mean, she can't be a show horse, so there's no point in selling her, but the deal is if you breed her, I must have her firstborn. Well, absolutely. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, I hope that's the end of the curse. I think so. What are you so happy about? Mom's not coming home. She says my dad needs her. You see? There was nothing to worry about.
