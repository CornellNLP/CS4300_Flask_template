 Previously on 'Heartland': 
 I've got a bottle of single malt. 
 Another time, Val. 
 At least he's not scared of horses like Lou. 
 You had your chance to be a father. 
 That was the past, Jack. 
 Those girls are gonna be a part of my future. 
 Nothing you can do about that. 
 Lou is trying her hand at pancakes. You'd sure be welcome to join us. 
 All right. Thank you. That sounds lovely. 
 Maybe you can come out to the ranch, though. I'll see you Saturday. 
 So, you told Jack yet? 
 Lou's telling him. 
 Sweet. How'd you manage that? 
 Well, it took two days, and we finally came up with a deal. 
 Lou's gonna tell grandpa about dad coming for lunch. 
 And I'm gonna give her a crash course... 
 ...to help her get back into the horse zone. 
 Lou and horses? Why? 
 Everybody knows she's scared of them. 
 Yeah. Everyone except dad. 
 Oh. 
 Hey, whoa. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. I'm fine. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. lt's the way you threw yourself at me there, I thought maybe you want to talk about something. 
 Grandpa? 
 Ah, there's something I have to tell you. 
 Well, I'm listening. 
 Would you put down the butcher knife for a minute, please? 
 Dad's coming over for lunch. 
 He's coming here? 
 Amy invited him. 
 When's he expected? 
 Saturday. 
 Saturday? 
 Perfect timing. 
 ♪ And at the break of day♪ 
 â™ª You sank into your dreamâ™ª 
 â™ª You dreamerâ™ª 
 ♪ You dreamer♪ 
♪ You dreamer♪ 
 Gotcha. Ha, ha, ha. 
 That's it. I'm done. I'm sick of being the cow. 
 Just because you want to show Amy's dad... 
 ...that you can do more than muck out stalls. 
 No, I don't. 
 Yes, you do. 
 Come on, Mallory, roping isn't a game. lt's a sport. Even a science. 
 Okay? lt's all in the way... 
 ...you build your loop here. See? 
 Then you gotta estimate your distance to the target. 
 You gotta make your throw just right. 
 Okay. Now, this time I want you to think like a cow. Okay? 
 Be the cow, Mallory. 
 Ready? 
 That's it. I'm done. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Moo. 
 Mallory. 
 Aw, come on, we were having fun. 
 He didn't curse, he didn't rant, his head didn't explode? 
 And he didn't say one nasty thing about dad. 
 Huh. Must've been having an off day. 
 [ Clears her throat ] 
 Ahem. 
 Tell me again how this is supposed to be helping me. 
 Well, you spend enough time in a horse's stall, you start to see the world from his point of view. 
 And while you're there, you might as well be doing something useful. 
 Anyone seen my hip-waders? 
 A little late in the season for fishing, isn't it, Grandpa? 
 Well, that's the beauty of it. 
 All the fair-weather fishermen are gone, but the fish are still there. 
 Uh... 
 And here are your hip-waders. 
 Oh... 
 Gee, do these make me look fat? 
 Oh, honey, nobody looks good in hip-waders. 
 That man you're going with, he won't be looking at your waders. 
 All right. I'm going to take it all. 
 Wha. lf this thing doesn't work out, what's your refund policy? 
 I don't have a refund policy. 
 But for you, ah, I'll make an exception. 
 Thank you, Maggie. 
 Now, your nephew was in here the other day. 
 Oh? 
 With Ashley Stanton. 
 I hear he's, uh, decided to train at Briar Ridge. 
 Hmm. He's a little at loose ends right now. 
 He was doing really well with Amy. I'm not particularly happy about his decision. 
 Yeah. Either is my Soraya. 
 Just sign here. We're all done. 
 I better catch something, huh? 
 I think you already did. 
 That looks great, Lou. Now to pick out his feet. 
 Oh, come on, Amy. Not the feet. 
 Okay, okay. I love the feet. lt's my favorite part. 
 Hey, Soraya. 
 What? 
 You're kidding. 
 Okay. I gotta tell Lou. Okay, bye. 
 You are not gonna believe this. 
 What? 
 Lisa Stillman just bought a bunch of fishing gear at Maggie's. 
 Hip-waders? 
 Hip-waders. 
 Just lean on him, Lou. 
 Ooo. 
 Whoa. 
 Going, uh, fishing, Grandpa? 
 That's what I said. 
 Yeah, but you, uh, you left out the important part. 
 That the October Caddis won't work this late in the season? 
 No. 
 That it's all about timing and you gotta match the hatch? 
 No. 
 We're not talking about flies, Grandpa. 
 That I'm taking Lisa to my fishing camp? 
 [ Stumbling ] No-- Yeah. 
 Well, if you already know, then what's there to talk about? 
 Well, you haven't invited anyone up there since grandma died. 
 Well, the way I see it, I'm grown up enough to manage my own private life any way I see fit. 
 I don't need any advice. I get plenty of that from Mallory. 
 So, if you'll excuse me, I've got other fish to fry. 
 Now I remember why I never liked lunging. 
 You're doing fine, Lou. Just-- He's getting ahead of you. 
 Well, I'm getting dizzy. 
 Don't worry. Just keep focused on the horse. 
 I can't focus. I'm getting dizzy. 
 Amy, please. Little help. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. I'm fine. I just, really need to... 
 Oh, I'm gonna puke. 
 Smells delicious. 
 Do you want a drink? 
 No, thanks. 
 Do you notice anything significant about the table setting? 
 Uh, they're using their fancy dishes? lt's the quantity. Not the quality. 
 Three plates. Three glasses. 
 Three forks. Three knives. 
 Do you see a pattern? 
 No. 
 We've been snubbed. 
 He's their dad, Mallory. lt's not like he comes by every day. 
 Getting together like this is a big deal for them. 
 And I think we should let them eat their lunch in peace. 
 Hey, is that Ben's aunt? 
 MALLORY: Why's she here? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, my God. Jack's going on a second date with Lisa. 
 He didn't even tell me. 
 Must've been an oversight on his part. 
 You don't understand. Amy's dad's coming back to the ranch. 
 Lou's working with the horses. Jack's practically engaged to Lisa. 
 Everything's changing so fast, I don't even know what to say. 
 You don't? 
 Wow. The world really has gone crazy. 
 All right. 
 You know where you're going. Do you want to drive the truck? 
 Truck. 
 You know, there are trucks, and, then, well, there's trucks. 
 Dad's here. 
 Yeah. Just give me one sec. 
 Remember, you do the talking. 
 I can't do all the talking. 
 Well, just until I feel like talking. And don't mention the accident. 
 Or the divorce. 
 Or the stuff with grandpa. 
 And, Amy, whatever you do, you gotta promise me you won't mention anything... 
 ...about my issues with the horses. 
 What issues? 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. l, uh, brought along an uninvited guest. 
 His name's Payback. 
 My mom just sends flowers as a hostess gift. 
 Mallory Wells. Neighbor. Horse lover. Friend of the family. 
 Well, friend. This isn't exactly a gift. 
 I kinda hoped Amy could do something with him. 
 What do you think, Amy? 
 Well, we're kinda full right now. 
 But there's always room for you, Dad. 
 Well, I'm willing to pay whatever you charge. I've already shelled out a few bucks for this guy. 
 He's a 3-year-old cutting horse. 
 Well, he seems even-tempered. 
 Yeah, he's got good eye-appeal. He's-- His dry work's good. 
 That's important, working well when they're dry-- 
 Or when you're schooling him without a cow. 
 Exactly. 
 Well, the thing is, Lou, a cutting horse has to be cowey. 
 Yeah, cowey, right. 
 Cowey. 
 Hmm-mm, cowey. 
 Yeah, they have to know... 
 ...what the cow's gonna do before the cow knows. 
 Right. 
 And this guy kinda blows up whenever he's around a cow. 
 So, what, Dad? You bought a cutting horse that won't cut? 
 Yeah. Don't rub it in. I've never worked with a cutting horse before, but I'd love to give it a try. 
 Good. 
 Here, I'll get him set up in the barn. 
 Nice to see you got some help with the horses. 
 Yeah. I'm glad too. 
 So, uh, I just have to get lunch out of the oven. 
 But, uh, make yourself at home. 
 Here. 
 Thanks, Lou. 
 This used to be home. lt's all the same. 
 But different. 
 So, how's it going with that black horse? 
 Good. I'm thinking of entering him in the Fall Finale. 
 How's the training coming? 
 Good, yeah, he, uh, he's a little better on his left lead than his right, so he tends to drift... 
 Could do with a little help. 
 You, uh, you using ground poles to keep him straight? 
 Uh, yeah, it works really well on training, but it's not so good when you're in a show. 
 I was planning on it being just the three of us. 
 Just the family. 
 Oh, all right. 
 Lou, what can I do? 
 You seem to be doing just fine. 
 Okay, you can set yourself another place. 
 Just promise me you won't talk so much, okay? 
 You know, the way you do. 
 My lips are sealed. 
 Okay. 
 What about Ty? 
 I was thinking we could do, um, trail rides aimed at a corporate clientele. 
 You know, like, what you can learn from a horse... 
 ...that'll make you a better executive. lt's all about branding, really. 
 And not the kind that involves hot irons. 
 I get it. Horses and executives, both full of crap. 
 I mean, it's, it's, it's about teamwork. 
 You know, uh, letting go. Knowing when to lead, when to follow. 
 Overcoming fears. 
 I mean, they do team-building exercises... 
 ...with rock climbing, fire-walking, and-- 
 Yeah, yeah, Lou, I think you're onto something. 
 So, Amy, when are we gonna' see you jump Spartan? 
 Well, I'm going to an arena later today. 
 You can come if you want to watch. You don't have to. 
 Can you guys at least wait until we've had dessert? I'll help you. 
 Me too. 
 So, Mr. Fleming... 
 Tim. Just, you can call me Tim. 
 Okay, Tim. I've heard a lot about you. 
 I mean, the drugs, the accident, the rehab. 
 And don't even get me started about all that stuff with Jack. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, Jack, this is heaven. 
 I don't get a lot of opportunity to bring company up here much. 
 Well, you couldn't have picked a better person. 
 Because there's just nothing I like more than to do a little fly fish... 
 ...I can see that. 
 All right. Busted. 
 Okay, I see now that maybe they'd have taken us... 
 ...to the arena with them if I just kept a little quieter. 
 I just don't know why he got so huffy. 
 I mean, it's not like it's a big secret. 
 Actually, Mallory, I'm glad you said what you did. 
 You are? 
 Yeah, I was thinking, ah, you busy this afternoon? 
 You mean, me and you? 
 Does this have anything to do with... moo? 
 This one looks good. 
 Looks good for what? 
 Watch and learn. 
 Come on, cow. 
 Come on, cow. 
 Bull's eye. I'd be more impressed if it was actually mooooo-ving. 
 Come on, buddy. Come on, let's go. 
 Oh, no. 
 There must be an easier way to do this. 
 Like ordering fish at a nice restaurant. 
 Look, I'm... I caught a tree. 
 Hang on, I'll give you... I'll give you a hand there. 
 Ohhh. 
 Oh, what did you catch? 
 Look at my beginner's luck. 
 Oh, look at you. You've got, well... 
 ...l'll go get it. 
 No, that's all right. Just... We'll just leave it here for now. 
 Set her down there. 
 Sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 Why don't you try my rod right here? 
 Here we go. 
 Now, take the rod in your right hand. 
 Like this...? 
 Uh, no. 
 No. 
 Uh, you gotta hold it a little more, um... 
 Up here, like this? 
 Kinda, put the, turn your, oh, what the hell, here. 
 Oh, okay. 
 You don't mind? 
 No, I don't mind. 
 Okay, right over this way. There you go. 
 I didn't know fishing was a team sport. 
 Me neither. 
 Okay, now, what we wanna do, get your line wet a little bit there. 
 And back and forth. Now strip a little bit out at the same time. 
 You pick a spot in the water and drop it right there. 
 Ha. 
 Perfect aim. 
 Now strip the line in as it goes down the river. 
 All right. 
 Strip it in, follow the line down with the tip of your rod, and... 
 There we go. 
 Okay, I'm fishing. 
 You are fishing. 
 Uh-oh. 
 What's happening? ls it stuck? 
 Oh, it's stuck again. 
 No. You just caught yourself a fish. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yes, you did. 
 Did l? 
 Yeah. 
 Ah. 
 Okay, there you go. Reel it in. 
 Good, Amy. 
 That looks good. 
 But you can tell that horse has a lot more jump in it. lt's not him that has a problem with the height. lt's me. 
 I mean, I've been working him over these low fences, just until I feel like we're more of a team. 
 You know, when mom used to coach me, she could talk me through anything. 
 And if that didn't work, she'd just hop up on my horse and show me how it was done. 
 Lou, why don't you help your sister out? 
 What are you talking about, Dad? 
 Well, last I remember, you got more jumping ribbons than you could fit on a wall. 
 Come on, you wanna talk about fearless. 
 You remember that, uh, Spencerville Classic? 
 Do you remember that? 
 Rain and mud and thunder, and no way you were gonna scratch. 
 Yeah, but I don't compete anymore, Dad. That was ages ago. 
 And, um, Spartan is really particular about who rides him. 
 Well, if Spartan's really particular. 
 Nah, if you haven't done it for a while, I understand. 
 You know, you shouldn't even try. 
 You should've seen your sister back in the day. She'd attack those jumps. 
 Come on, Lou. 
 When you see Amy up here, don't you feel like getting back in the saddle again? 
 I understand if you haven't done it for a while, and you're afraid. 
 You afraid? 
 No. 
 Hey, uh, give me a leg up, would you? 
 Lou, this is crazy. Just tell him the truth. 
 Shut up, Amy. 
 And don't you say a word until I get this damn horse over a jump. 
 This isn't a good idea. 
 Watch. 
 Uh, wow. 
 Look at her go. 
 Rider 5 1 2, Tim Fleming. 
 Daddy. 
 Yeah. That was great. 
 TlM: She still had it. 
 Lou, that was great, hon. 
 Why don't you try this gate over here? 
 
 
 
 Lou? 
 What was that about? 
 Amy told me. 
 I swear, Lou, I just never figured you'd stop riding. 
 Well, I'm glad you guys finally found something else to talk about... besides horses. 
 Now you can talk about me. 
 I just don't get it. 
 You were on a horse before you could walk. 
 That was then, Dad. 
 That was delicious. 
 Who would ever have guessed that you were so handy with a frying pan? 
 Oh, shhh, shhh. lt's one of my hidden talents. 
 The mystery of Jack Bartlett, unfolding before my very eyes. 
 No mystery, really. I'm a pretty straightforward guy. 
 I like working with my hands. 
 I only shave when the mood strikes me, and that's not too often. I've never been on an all-inclusive vacation, and you couldn't pay me to get on a cruise ship. 
 Can I say the rest? 
 Sure. 
 You like horses, sometimes more than the people that ride them. 
 You don't see the point in buying a new truck... 
 ...even though they changed the model ten years ago. 
 And even though it seems where this is going, you didn't bring me up here to propose. 
 Well, that's the thing. l, uh, you know, I haven't done a lot of... socializing... 
 ...since my wife died. 
 And, uh, and if I do, well, it's, we were married a lot of years. 
 Good years. 
 How did you meet? 
 Well, she was a singer in a roadhouse band, following the rodeo circuit, every town from Barrhead to Longview. 
 And I was at every show... 
 ...until I got busted up by a bucking horse in High River. 
 Ended up with a cast on my leg. I couldn't drive my truck. 
 Oh, no, you must have hated that, being chauffeured around. 
 Yeah. I had to take the bus. 
 I still made her show in Millarville though. 
 And that's when she finally noticed me. 
 We spent our honeymoon right here. 
 And then, uh, and then after the funeral, I spread her ashes in the river. 
 That sounds like quite a love affair. I'm very flattered that you brought me here. 
 I didn't mean to go on. 
 But I just don't want any misunderstandings or surprises... 
 ...if -- whatever this is -- continues past our little fishing trip here. 
 Well 'whatever this is,' 
I hope it does continue. 
 Otherwise, I've got a few hundred dollars worth... 
 ...of fishing equipment I'll never use again. 
 To whatever it is. 
 To whatever this is. 
 Well, look at that. 
 That's not such a bad idea. 
 Although the choice of cow leaves a little something to be desired. 
 All right, well, I'll, uh, I guess I'll get going. 
 Yeah, I guess. See ya. 
 Bye, Dad. 
 Okay. 
 You know, girls, uh... 
 Just seeing you standing there like that, the two of you, it reminds me of how hard it used to be... 
 ...to say good-bye. 
 Lou, you had all those curls. 
 Amy, you just wanted to get back with that pony all the time. 
 Yeah. I guess you were always saying good-bye, huh, Dad? 
 Yeah, yeah, in the rodeo days. 
 You two were just so small, I could pick you both up at the same time, and just breathe you in. 
 Oh. I thought you were, um, talking about the big good-bye. 
 I don't really remember much hugging back then. 
 Well... 
 ...l'm not that far out of reach these days, huh? 
 Just a couple of miles down the road. 
 Amy, you get a handle on that cutting horse, you give me a call. 
 You know, I see what you're doing. 
 Tie the horse and the cow together, and eventually they're just gonna have to figure out... 
 ...how to deal with one another. 
 They have to learn to read all those little signals. 
 For someone who doesn't want to talk--... 
 ...I just don't want to talk about talking. 
 I mean, maybe if we just hang around together, we'll get used to the idea. 
 What idea? 
 You just don't know when to shut up, do you? 
 Well, I guess it's easier if you're a horse. 
 This guy's already got it figured out. 
 The cow moves his ears, it's like he's telling him where he's gonna go. 
 Where she's gonna go. 
 Whatever. 
 Where did you get that cow from anyway? 
 I borrowed it from down the road. 
 The Vanderheyden's place? 
 Yeah. 
 That's a dairy farm. 
 This is a Jersey cow. A milk cow. 
 Come on, Ty, you were on a cattle drive. 
 You see any cattle that looked like that? 
 Well, he's brown. He's a cow. 
 And you know, even though it's a dairy cow, you take it from somebody else's field, it's still called cattle rustling. 
 Yeah, around here, people have been hung for less. 
 Well, that was really nice. I had a really wonderful time. 
 Yeah, there's nothing like a day on the river. 
 And you know, despite all your obvious flaws, I wouldn't mind if you called me sometime. 
 I might just do that. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my. 
 The whole posse's out. 
 Some other time. 
 I guess so. I'll just grab my gear. I'll give you a call. 
 All right. See you soon. Thank you. 
 So how was your fishing trip, Grandpa? 
 I managed to hook a real beauty. 
 Despite it being kinda late in the season. 
 Hey, Grandpa, I'm, uh, I'm making some tea. You want some? 
 No, thank you, Amy. 
 But, you know, I know how much you enjoy a cup of tea after your supper. 
 Now, why do I think it's not just a cup of tea? 
 Okay. You caught me. I kinda need a favor. 
 Well, let's hear it, and then I'll let you know about the tea. 
 I kinda need a dozen heifers. 
 Yeah, Dad brought over this cutting horse for me to fix, and, well, I kinda need something for him to cut. 
 So that explains the Vanderheyden's milk cow. 
 Yeah, l, uh, I made Ty take her back. 
 They're not gonna press charges or anything. 
 Sure, sure. I'll find you some heifers. 
 Thanks. 
 Just, uh, don't tell your dad they came from me. 
 Of course. 
 Hey, what happened to my tea? 
 What happened on your fishing trip? 
 You want those cows or not? 
 These cows aren't gonna hurt ya. They're afraid of you. 
 You don't need to be afraid of them. 
 That's a good boy. 
 Hey, what's wrong with this guy? ls he spooked or something? 
 Well, knowing Tim Fleming, I figure he's been jamming that horse too hard. 
 Hmm. lt's not that Tim doesn't know better. lt's just patience isn't one of his virtues. 
 Val, I have to confess, I'm not sure that Briar Ridge is the right place for Ben. 
 But I did want to talk to you about that. 
 You know, Ben and Ashley have become quite friendly lately. 
 Oh, I know Ben likes Ashley. 
 But I'm not sure that that's a distraction... 
 ...that he needs right now. 
 People always jump to conclusions about Ashley. 
 And maybe sometimes she deserves it. 
 But I can assure you, her mind is on one thing these days. 
 Show jumping. 
 She's determined to win the Fall Finale. So... 
 Oh, hey, Lisa. You know... 
 You know when I saw your car in the back, I was afraid you were here... 
 ...to bring all that fishing equipment back for a refund. 
 You know what, Maggie? I think I'm hooked. 
 Are we talking about fishing or Jack Bartlett? 
 [ Knock at the door ]... 
 ...lt's open. 
 I know I should have phoned, but... 
 Val. 
 Do you know, Jack, I can't recall the last time you invited me into your house. 
 A cup of coffee? 
 Got anything stronger? 
 Yeah, well, I'm sure I got a bottle of something here somewhere. 
 Let me see. 
 So, I had a long chat with Lisa today. 
 As you know, her nephew Ben is training at our place now. 
 Yeah. Well, hope that works out for him. 
 I imagine his decision has had quite an impact on your bottom line, huh? 
 Well, I guess we'll muddle through somehow. 
 But I don't figure you came here to talk about my bottom line. 
 Okay. 
 How long we've been friends, Jack? 
 10 years? 1 5 years? 
 And I know we've had our ups and downs. 
 Yeah. Plenty of those. 
 Right. 
 But I still consider you to be one of my dearest friends. 
 So I guess I'm a little surprised that you never told me... 
 ...you and Lisa were a serious item. 
 Hmm. I had to hear it from Maggie, of all people. 
 And you know how she feels about me. And Lisa? 
 Well, pfft. Huh. Shoulda heard Lisa telling everybody at the diner today... 
 ...all about your little fishing trip. 
 Oh, yeah, all she could talk about was the size of that trout. 
 Jack, I guess I just wish you'd felt that you could have told me. 
 You know what? Just forget it. 
 Thanks for the drink. I'm happy for you, Jack. I really am. 
 Working late? 
 Yeah. Well, the website. 
 When I told you about those corporate trail rides, I wasn't kidding. 
 I wasn't laughing. I've been making good progress with dad's cutting horse. 
 And I was just, I was wondering... 
 ...if maybe he could come by and take a look. 
 Of course. Why not? 
 I don't know, I just thought, after last time, maybe... 
 Look, Amy, it's fine. l... He brought you a horse, you worked on it, now you gotta show him how it's coming along. 
 Just don't expect me to stick around and pretend I give a damn... 
 ...if it's cowey or horsey or sneezy or dopey. 
 Make you a fresh pot, Grandpa? 
 Mmmm? What is it this time? More cows? 
 Dad's coming over at noon, to look at his horse. 
 I know I should've asked you first. 
 No, it's fine, Amy. 
 Really? 
 Oh, yes, today is your date with Lisa. 
 Well, everybody knows. 
 Just go easy with the spurs. He likes a light touch. 
 No, you've been working with him. You show me what you've done. I'm not much of a cutter. 
 Yeah, just show me what you got. Start down in the corner. 
 TlM: That one right there. 
 Come on. 
 You two seem to get along. 
 That's it. 
 Look at you. You got the cutter slump down already. 
 Huh? 
 TlM: Okay, now push him. 
 AMY: Come on. 
 Come on. Push him along the fence. 
 Come on. 
 TlM: That's it. 
 There you go. 
 TlM: Come on now. Bring him back. 
 That's it. Tighter. Little tighter. 
 Don't let him go. Whoa. Whoa. 
 AMY: Whoa, whoa. Cut, cut. 
 AMY: Come on. 
 TlM: Okay, now, tighter. Tighter. 
 Ram him harder. Ram him. 
 Now, keep your eye on him. Come on now. Bring him back. 
 TlM: That's it. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Aggh. 
 Amy. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, I'm okay. 
 You sure? 
 Don't move her. Just take it easy, just breathe, okay? 
 Aw, she just had the wind knocked out of her, huh? I've seen it a thousand times. 
 What is the matter with you? lt's okay, Lou. 
 No, it is not okay. lt's not okay, and it's never enough with you, is it? 
 How many times did I have to pick myself up out of the dirt... 
 ...and get back on just to make you happy? 
 And now look at you. You're gonna do the same thing to Amy. 
 After everything that happened to you. 
 What do you mean? My accident? 
 Why do you think I stopped riding? 
 Lou, that was just one of those things.

 The way you cleared that fence. 
 There was air to spare. And your position wasn't so bad either. 
 I can't believe I did that.

 Great. Just remember to breathe. 
 Anything you want to talk about?
