 Previously on "Graves"... 
 Do what's right tomorrow at the Treadwell parole thing. 
 This guy's mother shouldn't die thinking that what he did was in any way her fault. 
 Reporter :  Martin Treadwell has been granted a weekend furlough. 
 I can't talk now, Jonathan. 
 It'll only take a second. 
 The RPAC conference is gonna honor you, Mr. President. 
 What do you mean "family"? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Chuy, I'm out. 
 Jeremy :  Yeah? 
 Emery :  The best f*cking agent that ever lived got you your own show. 
 Isaiah :  My mom always loved you, sir. 
 She worked the Graves For President office You need to learn to pivot, direct him away from those cliffs he's so hell-bent on going over. The risks that I've taken for you, the lies that I've told! I quit. Man :  Then I graduated summa cum laude,  president of Hasty Pudding. Of course, you might have read that. The three and a half years I spent at Harvard... I graduated a semester early... were truly invaluable. Harvard pretty boy, huh? I can't take credit for my looks, sir. What can I say, God gave with both hands. I don't like you. I don't need you to like me, sir. My job is to assist. I do, however, have every confidence once you see what I bring to the table, you'll feel differently. No, no, I won't. Go easy on Eric, darling. He was Dick Cheney's body man for three years and his recommendation for Eric used the word "superstar". Thank you, ma'am. Maggie, what's all this? You know what this is. My campaign and our appearances... you have to have your detail back. It's not up for discussion. And you know what? I have some good news, honey. RPAC summit is inviting you back again this year. And again, I'm not going to attend. Except, boss, this time we need you to accept. They're giving you the Reagan Award, sir, honoring your transformational presidency. Who cares? They gave that award to Dan Quayle, didn't they? (laughs) Well, it's not about any award. I need you there. I'm gonna announce my Senate candidacy at RPAC. Margaret Graves For Senate is officially a go. The attendee list is huge. The Kochs, Adelson, Whitaker, the Bushes, the governor... Okay, so because they're honoring the former president, the summit is coming here to Santa Fe.  So... So they're basically handing Margaret the platform. It's the party showing full support. It's a new chapter, angel. Oh, yes, yes. New chapter. I need to get out a bit. We'll start with Mr. Graves' favorite spot for a bite. Plaza Coffee Shop, I believe. Then, depending on your energy level, sir,  a walk around the square for some exercise... Do not hurt him. (theme music playing) (music playing) ♪ Well, it's Christmastime ♪ 
♪ And everything's wrong ♪ 
♪ We're trimming the tree and singing the songs ♪ 
♪ We're hanging our stockings while missiles are launched ♪ 
♪ It's Christmastime and everything's wrong... ♪ Guard :  Quickly, let's go. ♪ Yeah, it's Christmastime and everything's wrong. ♪ Hello, Mother. I've been waiting a long time for this. A long time. Let me explain something to you, okay? If Google has a right to read my emails and the NSA has a right to tap my phones, then I feel like I should have a right to walk around with my junk out because privacy is dead. Look, you and I got lucky and fell out of a v*g1n* on the right side of the border. That can't be the only way to decide who gets to be a citizen here. It's like people with fair trade coffee would rather fight a war on Christmas than a war on ISIS. It's like I always say, people are only as stupid as their vote. Medicare is no different from hookers in Reno. They both want to suck you dry. I'm gonna come over there and beat the (bleep) truth into you. You belong here, Jeremy. Oh, you're too kind. Your own half-hour show. Nothing fancy. We'll shoot it on the set at our affiliate in Albuquerque. We guarantee you one show per week, all right? That's Saturdays at 6:00 P.M. But, you know, the way you're blowing up sh1t these days, we'll probably end up with three or four prime-time slots. Just keep that sh1t and the anger flowing. Yeah, well, you're not gonna have to worry about that, Doug. I'm basically like a bottomless well of acerbic observation. Also, just to be up front, you are gonna be asked about your mother and father. I'm not gonna lie to you, I mean, that's part of the whole appeal. That's part of your brand, you know? Bitter former first son giving us a warts-and-all look into his family and the world. Hey, f*ck 'em if they can't take a joke, right? (laughing) ♪ Ding dong merrily on high... ♪ So, I'm out of here. I'm packing up and I'm leaving next week. Where you going? Guess I'll know when I get there. I'm Eric, President Graves' new assistant. Wait, so Isaiah's gone for good? Who? Never heard of him. Well, that sucks. I guess I shouldn't be that surprised by it, but still. (sighs) You upset about it? No, don't be ridiculous. I never wanted that kid. Don't want this kid either. Hold on a sec. I've been reading your book. (groans) Sort of borrowed it from Isaiah, and I actually think I get it now. That kid was like your own Frankenstein's monster. I mean, here you said, "Politics is not much different than the movies. You and your spouse are cast in the roles the electorate expect to see you in. Image is the beginning of your message. It's your brand." Unfortunate, but true. No, that's unfortunate. Period. Look, I've been loving what you've been doing and it's been pretty f*cking amazing being a part of it, but, man, you've been so busy trying to fix the world that you f*cked up, you forgot that there are people that live in it. So as far as Isaiah goes, look back to who he was when he first started working for you. You broke him and broken people run. Of all the people that you feel you may owe an apology to, he just might be at the top of your list. (sighs) It's been real. Interesting girl. I did my second dissertation on variances of Stockholm syndrome. You're fired. What? Fired. It's really happening, guys. You bet your Jimmy Choos it's happening. Now, if we're serious on making the announcement at RPAC, there's very little time, not to mention the recent polls that just came in are lower than expected. I don't understand. I've always polled so well with the public. Of course you do. Don't let this one bring you down. People are fickle. They just want to get to know you again. I hope so. Well, we need to land on your message, like, yesterday. "Moving America forward for New Mexico." What the hell does that mean? We tested it. People think they know what it means. Don't forget your meeting with Chet Whitaker downtown in a couple of hours. He's not a done deal... publically undecided as to where he's putting his money. He's already met with Nash. He wants to see you dance. Come on, Whitaker's an old establishment money guy. He can't possibly take Nash seriously. Well, whether he does or not, he sees you as the wife, not the candidate. And why aren't we discussing Jonathan Dalton? There's no reason two fat cows shouldn't be milked. Not yet. I just... we need to be careful and considered. Anyway, welcome, y'all. Come on over here and tell me your names. I'm Margaret. (chuckles) Oh, boy. (sighs) (Spanish music playing) (humming) God damn it. It's okay. I've got another one in the oven. (hammering) Hey, no worries. It's okay, babe. Yeah. Um, listen, babe, I love your positivity, but isn't there anything that would or could make you, I don't know, unhappy? 'Cause there's always some bad with the good. You know, something to bitch about, right? No, not really. (gags) Excuse me. (knocking on door) Hey, bro. False alarm. Chuy! Oh, my gosh. What a surprise! Oh, are you gonna stay for dinner? Company! I love it. (laughs) Oh! (timer dings) And we might be able to feed you like proper hosts. (laughs) Say a little prayer. (speaks Spanish) (silenced gunshot) Holy sh1t. Hey, babe. (gasps) (doorbell rings) I don't believe it. You... well, you're... Yes, Mrs. Miller, I'm... No, you don't have to say who you are. I know who you are. Oh, my God. Unbelievable. Nobody's gonna goddamn believe this. (clicks) Sorry. Listen, my accountant talked to me and he said that Isaiah had asked him to send his check here. So, what, you brought it yourself? I had to come over to Prescott anyway to talk with the governor. Of course, the governor. 'Cause you're you. Wow, okay. So, this is where I raised Isaiah. Uh-huh. And these are pictures of him here. Yeah. I was in labor for 40 frickin' hours. His head was as big as a kettlebell. Ouch. Yes. Would you like to sit and have a Fresca? Yes. Sure. Fine. You're so handsome. Um, just sit... you can sit there. Thank you. Okay. Comfortable? There. You know, I thought 1,000 times about what I would say to you if I ever got the chance. You know, I was in my twenties when you first ran for president. Oh. And then I heard you speak. The moment I heard you speak, I knew. I understood what you stood for, what you were gonna do for us. So that's when I knew I had to help spread your word. You know? Presidents matter. It's what I always tell Isaiah. Presidents, they matter. Absolutely. Sorry, too much information. What the hell? Oh, okay. So let me have it. I'm sorry? My kid is... he's professional to a fault. Mm-hmm. Comes home from the job that I dreamt for him since before he was born without that job and doesn't say why. It's complicated. I mean, Isaiah has really high values. He also has a lot of unmet expectations. You know, President, I've known some real shitty men in my life. All of them, actually. So you see, that's why... that's why I felt real lucky when my kid had someone like you to look up to. I should go. Oh, don't go. I'm sorry. I talked this whole time. Can I get you something to eat? Are you hungry? No, no, no, I'm fine. Yeah, you want to know where he is. 
 
 (phone ringing) Tasha? No way. Is it okay that I'm calling? Totally. I'm just surprised. I mean, good surprised. I just... don't usually hear from my one-night mental hospital stands again. I know, it's so crazy. Even without all the lithium, I can't stop thinking about you. I don't know what to say. Conversely, I like being thought of. (laughs) I just had this insane morning. I just got off a plane and the most amazing f*cking thing happened. I got offered a job. Don't be weirded out, okay? Trust me, I don't weird out easily. It's just that you were the first person I wanted to call  when I got out of the meeting, which is kind of a big deal for me since I haven't wanted to share anything with anyone ever. So... (phone beeps) Wait, can you hold on just one second? Yeah. Liv? I can't move, Jeremy. I can't leave this room maybe ever. What the f*ck are you talking about? Jeremy. Help. Olivia, where the f*ck are you? (crying) The Yuletide candle line. Heaven. You know, the dripless tapered sugar cookie candle's our best seller? It's just like sitting in Grandma's kitchen. All right, you have a wonderful day and just remember, if you ain't buying, Santa's crying. (laughs) You're screwed. Very funny. Esther, I'm gonna take my break a little early, okay? Take the hat off, will you, please? This is not happening. Whitaker :  A year and change from now you're in Washington. What's your vision? I'd like to give New Mexicans back a sense of pride. Pride of ownership in their lives. Get them back working. Give them incentives to dream bigger for themselves and their children. Look, Margaret, this is what I need. I've got three factories in Vietnam. The tariffs are busting my ass. I need a better trade deal. I own mines in North Dakota and... With all due respect, Mr. Whitaker, I wouldn't be running in order to be your errand girl. Look, I'm not asking you to compromise your ideals. Your opponent, Thomas Nash, he will, but I'm gonna pay to have your ear. Well, I'm not too sure I'm interested, Mr. Whitaker, because this run, it's not about all that. It's about me for once. My ideas. Things I have to say since before I even met Richard. Don't be coy with me, Margaret. You've watched this game played long enough. You know how this works. Thank you for letting me bend your ear, Mr. Whitaker. I appreciate your time. I have to think about this. (bell rings) Isaiah :  What are you doing here? I mean, I know I left in a hurry without the prerequisite two weeks' notice, but I seriously didn't think I could stand one more day. Sammy wanted me to give you this autobiography she borrowed. There's also your last check in there. The US Postal Service stop operating in Arizona? Is that what you call gratitude? I mean, God damn it, Isaiah, I'm standing here in the middle of this f*cking parking lot, and I don't stand in the middle of parking lots. You know what? f*ck this. No, no, wait. Wait, sir. It's just... I just... I don't know. Well, what's this? It's part-time. I have a meeting with John McCain's office later today, actually, before everyone shuts down for the holiday. McCain? Is that your version of a good move? Yes, sir, it is. He's still very relevant, and in my mind he embraces a brand of conservatism that I really subscribe to. It's very sensible. You know that book you love so much? There's a story that I didn't include. It's when I was a young kid. Really a boy. I went riding one night on my horse. She was my first horse. A mare. She was beautiful. I raised her from a colt. We were riding down a dry creek bed and she stumbled. I thought she broke her leg. I jumped off. I looked at her. Ankle was twisted. I wanted to save her. So we walked back to the ranch. She limped all the way. I wanted to put her in the stall and raise her up to get the weight off that foot to help her, but my dad heard us come in. He came to the barn, took one look at that ankle, shot her. Put her out of her misery. I couldn't save her. That was the first time I really knew that I had let somebody down. Your father. No. Jesus! The horse! Oh, right, yeah, of course. The horse. (laughing) Oh, Isaiah. God, you're a thrill a minute. Sometimes, Isaiah, the wounds are all we are. Don't make me yours. You know, kid, I didn't write the world. Oh, f*ck! Liv? Olivia! I'm in here. sh1t. I didn't burn the chicken. What? Okay, great. Yeah, I'm proud of you. Are you hurt? No. What the f*ck? I didn't burn the chicken. f*ck the chicken! There's a dead man in the living room! Okay, I... I've got to get you out of here. I've got to make it look like you were never here. So you just... you just stay there, okay? And give me the mitts. Give me the mitts. Give me the other mitt! Okay, I'm sorry! You owe me so f*cking big for this. I got the bag. Did you touch anything?

Apologies for Senator McCain not being here, but, you know, last minute sh1t. Oh, yeah, of course. I would never expect... Well, anyway, since we've all got lives, I'll make this quick. The senator received a phone call from Richard Graves about an hour ago. Oh? Yeah, the former president gave you a pretty stellar recommendation. Said that the senator should just hire you because he will not find someone better. Said you're a superstar. And then he added something about interviews being for pussies. I know. Anyway, so, the job's yours if you want it. Okay, thank you. I got you. It's just you and me. I got you, okay? Oh, boy. Here we go. Oh, boy. Here we go. Hey. Yeah? Will you stay with me?

I mean, honestly, I've done more living in the last few months... Jesus, will you get to the point? Just ask for your job back already. I'd like to come back. I mean, I know I owe Mrs. Graves an apology, and I understand if it's too late, sir, but if there could be just a little less yelling in general, fewer attacks on my manhood, maybe a smidgen of respect?

You might know me as New Mexico's number one veterinarian. Now I want to turn my attention to my two-legged friends. That's you, New Mexico. Because I know what you need... a real conservative who will cut taxes, rein in spending, protect religious freedom by pushing to defund Planned Parenthood, and secure our border. Do the right thing, friends,  and vote Thomas Nash for Senate. Don't let this little guy down, okay? (laughs) I don't know what to tell you, Margaret. The man saves puppies. The man is an oil slick, Chet. He will promise you the sun, moon, and the stars, and then he'll slide right out from under you, leaving you covered in the muck of his terrible policies. Now, I won't make empty promises to you because that's not the way I do business, but my door will always be open if and when you'd like to be heard. So, you want my support?

Regarding the affair between his wife Margaret Graves and Jonathon Dalton when she was in the White House. What?
