 Ali left everything behind to search for true love. 
 Hi. 
 She met 25 handsome men... 
 Cheers! Whoo! 
 In hopes that one of them would be her husband... 
 Frank : hello, Hollywood! 
 Ali : Whoo! 
 Frank : sitting here in this spot Feels like the most romantic place I've ever been. 
 When it's right, it's just something that you just know. 
 I'm not falling in love with the idea of you. 
 I'm not falling for the concept of love. 
 It's because I genuinely care about you. 
 But her journey was more difficult Than she ever thought possible. 
 How do you know that person's right for you? 
 It's just my heart. 
 Jump in. Stay a while. 
 (sighs) 
 (Jessie) one of the guys there has a girlfriend. 
 It's unspeakable, what you've done. 
 I came here to find a husband, and you're (bleep) with that. 
 I feel like this could work, but, like, you still wonder how. 
 Ali : I feel like things have Been sort of up and down with Frank. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I think my relationship with you scares me. 
 But in the end, only three men remained... 
 (laughs) (grunts) 
 Roberto, Chris and Frank. 
 Frank : I dreamed of coming to Tahiti for years, and I should be happy. 
 Last week in Tahiti, Roberto was flying high... 
 Roberto : it's so beautiful. 
 I mean, and sharing this with Ali, It's something I can't even describe. 
 This is so cool! 
 I've never felt this way about anybody. 
 I'm falling in love with you. 
 And Chris was ready to take the plunge... 
 Aah! Chris : I love being with her, and I don't want to stop. I really see myself with you forever. You know that, right? Really? Yeah. (laughs) But her dream turned into a nightmare When Ali's biggest fear came true. Ali, we need to talk. (Ali, voice breaking) to come to this point, this point right now and do this is so unbelievably selfish. (cries) He knew how I was feeling. He knew how I attached I was to him. I can't help but think, like, there's something wrong with me. (sighs) After Frank left, it's more important than ever That I don't just offer a rose to the guys, but that they accept it wholeheartedly. One thing I can confidently say is that I am 100% positive that Frank is not the guy for me. I'm ready to just let everything go That's happened throughout this whole journey and move forward with these two fantastic guys. And tonight... Ali : I never would have imagined Being here in Bora-Bora. This is a dream for me. I just feel so lucky. Ali is in paradise with the two men of her dreams... Oh! Aah! But now it's time to meet her family. How you doing? Nice to meet you. This is Roberto. I'm Roberto. Will Roberto win their approval... It's so important to me that I have your blessing. I gotta learn more about you. It's such a short time frame here. Or will Chris get the Mily's blessing? So Chris is from Massachusetts. (gasps) really? Oh! Chris : when I propose to Ali, I wanna become Part of her family. I want her brother and sister To be like a brother and sister to me. I want her mom and Dad to be like a mom and Dad to me. You met Ali two months ago. I mean, can you honestly tell me that you love my daughter? And then... Ali : every relationship I've had in my life Has led up to this moment. Tonight, it's the moment we've all been waiting for... I'm a mix of emotions. When Ali faces the biggest decision of her life. I'm thinking about these two great guys I have, and they're both amazing guys, but there's always that fear That, you know am I making the right choice? You won't believe what happens. I wanted to come here and risk everything for love, and today I've taken that ultimate risk. It's all coming up right now On the unforgettable season finale of... I never would have imagined being here in Bora-Bora. This is a dream for me, and to think that I could possibly get engaged At this amazing island I've always wanted to go to... I just think that's so special. I cannot believe that this is almost over. Looking back to the first night and there bein25 guys... (cheering) And not knowing what would happen.. Hi, guys. I can't believe I found two guys. Cheers. Cheers. Bora-bora. Ali : I've had an amazing time going to all these countries... (filtered voice) wow! (filtered voice) wow. Oh, my God! Look at the volcano! This is absurd. And experiencing things I never thought I would. (cheer whistles and applause) But this has been one of the most difficult and challenging journeys of my life. I gave up my job. I gave up my apartment. I gave up everything to here. And for you to to this, It's... it's unspeakable, what you've done. Ali, I'm sorry. Ali : but after literally going around the world to find love, What matters is not really where I am but who I'm with. And I-I feel like I'm finally in the clear and I'm so ready to move forward With the two amazing men I have left. Chris and Roberto are very different, and I have completely different relationships with each of them That have progressed at completely different paces and different ways. (laughs) What? Did I get you off-track? No. I'm blushing. (gasps) Right from the beginning, I knew there was A special connection between me and Roberto, and I've never felt that way right away with someone, So it was, like, a new feeling for me, and that's so exciting. Aah! Whoa. I got you. I got you. I got you. See, you made me fall for you. I got you. I got you. Okay. When I'm with Roberto, I feel protected, It's the first time I feel so safe in a relationship. I really hope to watch a lot more of these with you. Roberto's just so sweet and genuine, and he makes me feel beautiful. He makes me feel cute. He makes me feel like a woman. Are we the only ones dancing in the street? Mm-hmm. I've always had really strong feelings for Roberto, but I've always sort of wondered if he was too good to be true and if this could really work. But waking up next to Roberto After our overnight date, I knew right then and there, When I opened my eyes and saw him laying next to me That I was falling in love with him. Hi. How you doing? Good. How are you? So nice to meet you. Oh, you, too. Ali : my relationship with Chris Has really been a slow, steady, uphill pace. Because our relationship has progressed more slowly, I feel like we're really good friends That are just starting to fall in love. I really see myself with you forever. You know that, right? I can't even tell you the percentage Of my relationships that have started off as friendships. You know how to make me happy. I-I try. (laughs) Chris is the guy who makes me laugh so much and has such great character, and, yeah, I can't help but fall for him. Whoo! I feel like he's a big Teddy bear That I just want to wrap myself around and hug and squeeze. I can't believe you're here. This is awesome. (laughs) Chris and I are both from Massachusetts, and Chris reminds me a lot of my friends back home, and I know he'd fit in my life so well. I've gotten to a place with him where I feel really comfortable, and I feel like we've been together forever. You look a lot like your mom. Yeah. Ali : his mom had told him to look for her in rainbows. I think it's very endearing. Good to see you. We got so much closer when I met his family, and then here in Tahiti, our date was perfect. Chris is amazing. What? I'm happy. I cherish my time with cis, and I never wanna let go. I never wanna say good-bye Or stop kissing him or being close to him. I'm realizing that Chris could really be the one for me. This journey is coming to an end, and I'm feeling very nervous, Because when I give my heart to someone, There's no guarantee. I feel extremely vulnerable, but I'm just holding on to faith That everything will be as it should be. Up next... Hi! (laughs) Roberto meets the family... Getting to know your daughter has been amazing. But will he win their trust? Roberto : there's no real way to prepare For the kinds of questions that they'll have for me. Do you love Ali? And then... Are you nervous? Why? Should I be? Chris holds nothing back. I wanted to find the girl of my dreams, like, my soul mate. I really am falling in love with your sister. And later, it's the moment everyone is waiting for... Ali : the only reason I came here is because  I thought I could find love at the end of this. But Ali makes A shocking decision that will change her life forever. It's all coming up on the season finale Of the bachelorette." (exhales deeply) Ali : I cannot believe that this is almost over. I could be engaged at the e of this week. You know, I've tried to enjoy the journey along the way, but ultimately, It's... it's where I end up that matters. I'm so thrilled That Roberto and Chris are gonna be meeting my family. I just think it's exciting That my parents could be meeting my future husband. Today, I'm sure Roberto's gonna make a great first impression. He did on me. So I think they're just gonna be thrilled. Roberto : you know, today's the day I meet Ali's family, and obviously, going into this, I'm nervous. Her family's approval of me is really important to me, and this is a huge deal. I just hope they like me, you know? I really, really, really want today to go real well. Howdy. Hi. Aw. Ali : I always look forward to seeing Roberto, and today's no different. I feel so proud introducing him to my family. How are you? Good. How you doing? Good. Good? You excited? Yes. You look so handsome. You look beautiful. Should I be nervous? No. You sure? Not at all. Roberto : I can sense that she's feeling excited right now, and I'm the one with the nerves going on. It's important for me today to, uh, Make sure that Ali's family knows That I'm here for the right reasons, that I care for her and that family's extremely important to me. Have you seen them? No. You haven't seen them? No. (laughs) oh, that's awesome. I think that's the most important thing, so that's What I'm gonna focus most on, uh, getting across to them. Oh, I'm a little nervous. (both laugh) you'll do great. As I'm walking up the steps, of course, the one thing Running through my mind is I hope there's a good connection, Because this could potentially be my in-laws. Hi! Hey. Hi, Dad. Hello. Nice to meet you. How you doing? This is Roberto. Sorry. I'm Roberto. Very nice to meet you. Roberto, how you doing? Yes. I'm doing great. Nice to meet you I'm Alex, Ali's Dad. Hi, mom! Hi! Doing great. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Hi! Having Roberto with my family Makes things more real for me, brings it back home. Ali : oh, God, I've been waiting so long. I'm so excited to see my family, which is my Dad, my mom, and then my sister Raya and my brother Michael. When we met, he spoke Spanish to me. I thought it'd be cool. Say it. (laughs) What, exactly the way I said it? It was like, um... (speaks Spanish) If you want to have a dance later, I'll be, you know, I'll be waiting for you inside or whatever. Aw, that's beautiful. And, um, so the thing was, I was so nervous, 'cause I don't know if I translated it. It was so... Yeah. (laughs) and then when we got inside, He taught me how to dance salsa. So... Oh. Oh, I love it. Roberto : I feel like I got a warm reception from everybody, but I still have to have a good, uh, sit-down with the parents and have those important conversations, and part of me was worried about that, naturally, you know? There's no real way to prepare for the kinds of questions They'll have for me. I do have to ask, who's your favorite baseball team? Oh, man. It's very important. The Tampa blue Rays. The Tampa Bay Rays? Bay Rays. Did you say Red Sox was your favorite team? Yeah, I did. Ali : just say yes." so, um, Roberto, do you wanna go outside and we can talk for a little while? Sure. Let's go. All right, great. Ali's happiness is very important to me, and I don't want to see her get hurt, and I'm hoping That Roberto has really strong, genuine feelings for her Because I would never want her to settle for anything less Than she deserves. I never thought I'd be in this kind of situation With your sister. Night number one... get out of the limo, Like, everything changed. Mm. Like, it went from this is a cool experience" To okay, I wanna stay for her," and, like, it was, like... Mm-hmm. An instant connection, at least for me it was. Like, the first night, I sat with him, and he talked to me, and he was just... he, like, made me feel more calm. Mm-hmm. And, you know, I'm, like, a little hyper, you know? Yeah, like your Dad. Join the club. He brings me, like, to a very peaceful place, Like he brings me down... Right. But he appreciates my sort of social side. Yeah, but he probably has a sense That you need that kind of calmness. Calming. Right. He, like, will dance and he'll sing in my ear and... Oh, that's sweet. He's, like, he's so romantic, and he's... He's great. Right. (laughs) Woman : when I look at a, she looks extremely happy. Roberto is the tall, dark, handsome... (laughs) man of Ali's dreams. But as Ali's mom, I really need to have The time to sit with him To really get a sense of who he is. This is a difficult journey, but you're here. But it's... but it's great. Don't make any mistake. Right. It has been... getting to know your daughter has been amazing. And I guess I should ask If you have any questions for me about Ali. As a man, As a, hopefully, a husband one day... Mm-hmm. To her, um, what can I do To make sure she's always happy and... and keep her happy? The funny thing is, is I think you're already doing it. (laughs) and she made that clear to me, That whatever it is that you've done From the minute you stepped out of the limo until today... Mm-hmm. Has been exactly what she needs and will... will make her happy. I-I felt that immediately... Yeah. And, you know, I would not say that if I didn't feel it. I can't contain The joy of this whole experience. Yeah. I... you know, even though... Even though, um, Uh... It's okay. (voice breaking) I'm just so happy for her. I really am. And, um, I just see that she really cares for you. Okay. Um, I care for her, too... Yeah. And I'm gonna take care of her. I-I can see that, and so I wanna say to you, um, and I might not say it right... (chuckles) But, um... Yo... Yo creo... Que tu corazón es puro. Gracias. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Yeah. And... I appreciate that. That means a lot to me. Did I say that right in Spanish? Was that right? You said... yes, it was, yeah. I hope that's helpful to... to relay my feelings. I feel good speaking with her mom. But at the end of the day, We know there's some serious things that n... That need to be talked about, especially with Ali's Dad. Maybe this will happen. (laughs) I hope so. I hope he really understands how I feel about her, but above all, I really hope That I actually get his blessing. Roberto : going into my talk with Ali's Dad, I knew this was Gonna be a time for him to ask some really tough questions. Coming from a more traditional background, I think it's really important for the man To have that conversation with the Dad, and let him know what his intentions are and ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. It's just something that I think you... that you have to do This is nerve-racking because this is a huge deal. At least we get a chance to talk, and I get to know you one-on-one... Absolutely and, um, I gotta get... learn more about you. Oh, absolutely. It's a short time frame here and... To make an important decision... and, um, I guess my... My first question to you is how do you feel about Ali? Tell me. I went into this. I didn't know what to expect, but I went in kind of with an open mind. And I was nervous, Like I told you guys, as soon as I walked up... Sure. And I kinda had my head down, and I looked up at her, and as soon as I made eye contact with her, Something happened, something I knew was good... Mm-hmm. And I asked her, what, you know, priorities were in her life and things like that, and she kind of expressed to me How important family was and, uh, how important it was That she had somebody Who has completely devoted to her unconditionally. And a big part of me is making the person I'm with happy, and that's kinda what I talk to her about... Where we'll live and... and all the things we'll do. I-I'm kinda more concerned about making sure she's happy... Mm-hmm. Because I feel like I could be happy wherever, if she's happy. You' her father, and obviously, um, You know, I care for your daughter a lot. And... and hopefully, What I wanted to convey to you today Was how much I genuinely care about her and want to make her happy, and I hope that you at least have a sense of that, and it's so important toe um, as we'that...Ed. I have your blessing If I was to propose to her and ask her to be my wife. Do you love Ali? I do. Okay. I do. She's such a strong woman in so many ways, and you know all these things. She has so much to offer and... and, uh, I do always want to keep her smiling... Right. And not just for the next couple months, You know, I'm thinking... thinking long-term. I guess in your case, uh, uh, You said you love Ali, you know, and, um, Uh, it sounds like you come from a good background To give her some stability, so that... That gives me a little comfort, you know, Some comfort about who you are, you know... Mm-hmm. And, um, I think you're a great guy. So, uh, I don't see a problem with that. So... Roberto : I'm excited right now and I got her Dad's blessing now. He just smiled at me and he said... he said, "yeah, you know, I have no objections to that." Well, thank you so much. You know, everything looks good, and that so huge, and, uh... (exhales deeply) that was a relief. (chuckles) I want you to feel like I could be part of the family... Okay. And... and feel like, feel like you know, we still Have a lot of good memories. You have to teach me how to salsa dance. Oh! (laughs) you wanna do it right now? Sure. So it's gonna go back like this. So this one? No, you're right. So just gonna go back and... Back. Back. Ali : normally at family get-togethers,  I'm the one dancing and everyone else is Just sort of laughing at me. So it's really great That Roberto was able to get everybody up and dancing and just having a really good time. And then go back. Oh! Yay, mama! (Alex) right. I saw Roberto less shy with my family than I've ever seen him. He just fit right in. He was chatting with everyone, and he was so eat. I loved seeing him with them. I feel like I have such a strong connection with Roberto, and it just keeps growing and growing. Ali : all right, bye-bye. Roberto : see you. (Alex) bye. They love you. I ho so. I feel closer to Ali now that I've met her family. I-I feel like I've seen her in her comfort zone, and, uh, I love that. I could see myself as part of that family. They loved you. (laughs) I love them. They were awesome. Aw. Your whole family is... is really cool, and they were fun. I told you they'd like you. Roberto : I'm excited right now. This is uncharted waters for me. There's the potential I could get married at the end of this. There's also the potential that this amazing journey Ends with heartbreak. And it's tough, but what's kept me going forward Through this whole thing Has been those thoughts of the future with Ali. It's really hard, but I think in the end, It's... it's really all gonna be worth it. See you soon, okay? Bye. Adios. Ali : I think it's really good to know That this great feeling I've gotten from Roberto Since the beginning, My family's getting that feeling, too, and I've been looking for something wrong with him All along, but so far, my family seems to think That he's pretty great, too. (sighs) But tomorrow I have to do this all over again, and I still have one more great guy for them to meet, and I really hope they love him, too. ♪ Coming up... How you doing? Nice to meet you. Chris meets mom and Dad... Have a seat, Chris. Thank you. But will he pass the family test? I mean, you've had... to say a limited time with me Would be an understatement... but, you know, I would love  To ask for her hand in marriage. And then, Chris and Roberto have one last Chan with Ali. Roberto : it's tough, because I think it's important That I let Ali know what I'm feeling, but it makes me a little nervous. Who will be offered Ali's final rose? And will he accept? It's all coming up On the exciting season finale of the bachelorette." Ali : today I'm bringing Chris to meet my family, and I'm excited. (laughs) Hi, you. How are you? Yesterday, Roberto and I had such a good time with my family. But I really just want my family to have an open mind today Because they still have to meet Chris, and I know he'd make a great husband. So I just hope that my parents can see th today.

Chris : it's definitely gonna be scary today, Meeting her parents for the first time. This is the one day that Ali's family gets a chance to meet me, and, uh, I want Ali's family To see that I would be a great husband for Ali. They're gonna love that you're from Massachusetts. That's what I was hoping. I'm definitely expecting tough questions today Because I could have the chance, really soon, To propose to Ali, and, uh, when you marry a girl, You marry her family as well. You ready? Yeah. So it's very important that I get along well with her family and that her family gets along well with me, Because that could be a deal breaker. (Ali gasps) hi! Hello. Chris.

Um, she was an incredible person, so... I'll bet. She was a nurse and great mother. Yeah. I'm a nurse. Perfect. What's... what's your father... what's he do? Uh, my father started a landscaping company About 10 or 15 years ago. But he was a teacher for a while. (Alex) okay. Oh, nice. I'm a teacher also. Oh, you are? I used to teach High School physics.

And what... do you... do you work for the landscaping company? Yeah, I work for my brother and my Dad. Okay. So what do you brothers think of Ali? They were amazed by how, like, just down-to-earth and nice she was and, uh... Tell us what they really thought. (all laugh) Ali : I thought my family was gonna see right away That Chris is an amazing guy, and I was right. They are loving him, and I feel like that's making Chris feel really good, and it's making my family feel good about him. I'd like to, uh, propose a toast to Ali and Chris and everybody here, that we're here in this wonderful place and we get to meet this nice gentleman That may be in our family very soon, and, uh... (all) cheers. Going into today, obviously, I was hoping that her family Would be easy to talk to, and I want her family to love me and accept me. When I propose to Ali, I want that to happen, and I think it will. Actually, I know it will. My Dad... he grew up in... in Montreal. He's... he's Canadian. Oh, I was born in Montreal. Strange. Weird. Your father's born in Montreal. I'm born in Montreal and... Chris, can... if you don't want to talk about it, it's fine, but can you tell us about your mom? Um, yeah, she, uh, Well, like I said, she was a nurse and she was incredible, and, uh, she started getting sick, and, uh, it was a degenerative disease. When she started getting really bad, I moved home.... You moved back home. To help out. And, uh, she, uh, She's very stubborn, So she lasted until my brother's wedding. Oh, that's good. And, uh, she passed away about a month yep. Yeah., but, uh... That's wonderful. Re. What was she like growing up? Oh, she was, uh, She was the most amazing mom you could ever ask for, Uh, just such a nice lady. Uh... Did she stay home when you were small or did she have to work? Um, well, she was a nue, so she worked the night shift, Like, 3:00 to 11:00. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Um, so my Dad would be there for dinner, and we'd always have, like, breakfast for dinner. We'd always have, like, French toast. Or pancakes, right? Chris : yeah, so it was fun. Chris, do you wanna come outside and talk with us? Let's go. This is a limited amount of time for them to get to know me, and in a few days, I might very well be their brother-in-law. Are we sitting in the water? Yeah. Oh, I like it. So it's very important that they see who I am and how great I can be for Ali and how great Ali and I could be together. So are you having fun so far? Actually, I am. Good. Yeah, we are, too. It's probably been a crazy experience for you. Yeah. (chuckles) very crazy. How have you and Ali been connecting? How's the relationship been progressing? Um, we... we kinda progress slower than everybody else. Um, when I came into this, I just wanted to be... To make it as natural and real as I could, Given the process. So, like, I didn't wanna just walk up to her and be like, "hi. I'm Chris. I love you" 'cause that's weird. (laughs) yeah. If you do that at a bar, a girl would be like, "oh, yeah, okay. I'll see you later," you know? So I just wanted to, like, kinda make it natural and see if we liked each other, and then if we did like each other, You know, see if we could love each other but do it as slow and steady as you can and in as limited time as you can. Right. You know, I think that we've gotten really close and we've progressed as, like, a real relationship would... Mm-hmm. Which is what I liked, and I think she likes that as well, and, uh, obviously, she likes me 'cause I'm still here, and... Yeah. (laughs) Well, what do you think of Chris? I like him. He's really, really nice. He's sweet, cute. Like, my relationship with Chris  Just has moved a lot more slowly, and... Like, what do you think about that? Have you ever had any relationships like that? I think relationships that start slowly and as friends Can be extremely good relationships and very meaningful. For me, he seems very secure in who he is, Very supportive, comes from a good family, So much so that he gave up whatever it was That was in his life at the time. To go home and be there for his family. Mm-hmm. That shows tremendous love... Really great love to be able to do that. He's wonderful, and... (sighs) (laughs) I'm glad I don't have to make the decision. So do you guys have any more questions for me? 'cau, like, the weird part about this is that We only get, like, a couple hours together, and then in three days I'm gonna be proposing to your sister. Yeah. How does that... how does that make you feel? I really am falling in love with your sister, and she is an absolutely incredible girl... Incredible, and, uh, like, I don't know what I thought Coming into this, but, you know, I didn't think She was gonna be this incredible and, like, this down to earth and, like, this easy to get along with. That's why I'm still here, because if she wasn't like that, I definitely would've left. Right. Yeah. And if I didn't feel something, I would've left. Because I wanted to find the girl of my dreams and, like, my soul mate, my one, and, you know, The fact that in three days, I'll have that... that's awesome. (both) yeah. You know? 'cause my brothers... one's married, and the other's one getting married in October, and so they've found their ones, and, like, I'm jealous, 'cause I see how much fun they have with their wife. Mm-hmm. And, uh, you know, I want that. Chris seemed very genuine to me. He told us more than once that he felt That he was in love with her, and he seems like a wonderful guy That puts the important things first.

I got a feeling you will. I got a feeling. I'll be psyched to have Ali's family as part of my family. Um, very excited about taking the next step In Ali and I's relationship, but even tough this is all going so great, I still have a very important question I need to ask. I want to ask Ali's Dad for his daughter's hand in marriage. If her father didn't approve and didn't give me the okay to marry his daughter, Well, I don't think that she would say yes to me. It's gonna be hard... Very, very hard. ♪ Know somebody Who would make a great bachelor or bachelorette? Go to bachelor. ABC.Com and click apply." ♪ We have lots of Ali stories. Mm. I got all day.

I mean, today s wicked amazing, but there's one more thing I have to do. Chris, um, would you like to go out and talk? When Ali's Dad asked me to go outside and talk, you know, I knew that was gonna be the toughest Of the conversations, because it's very important that I ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. Have a seat, Chris. Thank you. I can't propose to Ali unless I have her father's permission, and today and right now is the only chance I'm gonna get. But I want him to know that I'll definitely Just cherish her and love her for the rest of my life. Being Ali's Dad, of course, maybe some of my questions Might be searching for some things. Yeah. You know, I'll protect my daughter. Yeah. And, um, your feelings for Ali... I mean, you met Ali two months ago possibly... Yeah. And you went through this journey. Now you're here. I mean, can you honestly tell me that you love my daughter? You know, I'll be honest. The most important thing for me is family, and, you know, If I'm lucky enough to have Ali as part of my family... Sure. You know, she's gonna be the number one thing in my life, and everything else, you know, will fall into place, I feel, after that. You know, the last three years of my life Were up and down and confusing. Right. But I learned a lot, and I learned a lot about myself. Learned a lot about, you know, what's important, and I saw, you know, when my Dad was taking care of my mom and how important she was for him, and, you know, I want that, and I'm ready to find My soul mate and my perfect one. And she's... whenever I see her, an AI just start smiling, l, and I'm just happy, you know? Right. And I feel like she has the same passion for life That I do, and that's why when the two of us are hanging out, We're just, like, so... Excited to be here, Wherever here" is, and I like that about her. Okay. I like that she's passionate about life. She just has this glow in her eye. I love her eyes. And she just has this big smile When she comes running wards me and, like, jumps into my arms, and it just. It's a great feeling. It really is. It's a feeling you can't really describe other than It's a great feeling, you know? It doesn't sound like much,  But at the end of the day, that's huge. It is huge. And not many people have that, ? And that's what I want. Much, I'm falling in love with her every time that we... I'm with her, every time I see her. So I guess one of the thin I wanna talk to you about is if, in a couple days now, if she so chooses, I may...Chuckles) I might be asking for her hand in marriage, and, I mean, you've had...

I definitely think that Ali and I's relationship Took another gigantic step today. 
 
 ♪ I really think that Ali is my soul mate and perfect person, and it's exciting to think about that, Because I can stop looking, and that makes my life complete. ♪ Thanks for coming. Thank you for today. Okay. See you. Saying good-bye to Ali... it just gets harder. Walking away from her, I was like, ugh. Walking down that bridge away from Ali, I just wanted to run back, grab her and just run away together, 'cause I don't wanna do this anymore. I just wanna be able to be like, "all right, let's go. Let's just be together." I'm definitely falling in love with her, and, uh, She's the perfect girl for me. We are gonna have an incredible, incredible life together. Ali : I have so much going through my head right now. One thing I'm realizing more now than ever is that it's not about who's a great guy. They're both great guys. It's about who's right for me,  And that makes it that much more difficult. I don't know what to do. ♪ Coming up, It's Chris and Roberto's last chance To win Ali's heart. Roberto : It's down to me and Chris, and, uh, I try not to think about Whatever they're doing, what's going on with them. And then, it's the dramatic ending of Ali's love story. Ali : I wanted to come here a, and today I've taken that ultimate risk. Has she found the man of her dreams? And if so, does he love her back? It's all coming up next On the season finale of the bachelorette." So how do you feel after having both them meet us? I'm about to make one of the most important decisions I will ever make in my whole life, and this is harder than I thought it was gonna be. After these past two days, I'm realizing more than ever, I have two amazing guys, and because my feelings are so all over the place right now, I think it's great that my family's here to help me Figure those out. I have a decision to make. Yeah. You know, and I have a lot of thoughts That I am thinking, but first I want to sort of Get all of your opinions. They're both great guys, and... but Roberto... There's something about him that was showing That he had a love for you, and I could see it in his eyes. And he tells me that. He tells me loves me. There's something about him right.At was showing Well, I can definitely see Roberto As being part of the family. He's very engaging. He mentions that he wants to make Ali happy. That gives me a lot of confidence of who he is, and so I'm happy if Roberto wants to propose to Ali. Roberto's more willing to move forward With a relationship with you. That's how I felt. Mm-hmm. But Chris was just a little bit more hesitant. Mike and I had a different experience with Chris. Me, too. Me, too. Um, I mean, I felt that Roberto was very open About how he felt about you, and he seemed very romantic. Yeah, he wore his feelings, like, very much on his sleeve. Right. And he let it be shown how much he cared for you. Your chemistry together was good. That's what I said. But I feel very differently my reaction to Chris than you. (Alex) right. Chris said more than once to Mike and I, um, "I'll be proposing to your sister in three days." Yeah, it wasn't a question of confidence. It was never a question whether or not... He did tell us more than once that he was in love with you, and he didn't say, "I might be proposing" Or "I could be." he said it flat out. Really? He liked that your relationship Was progressing at a normal rate, and he just feels like it's real. You're real with him, and he's real with you. Roberto said the same thing. Just the way that he said it feel very real to me. I think it was good to hear Chris say that he felt that the relationship  Was going in the direction that it should be going. Within such a short amount of time,  I feel like that is the appropriate response. There's good and bad to falling madly, deeply in love and having the fireworks and the romance. Sometimes it doesn't stay that way. Right. Mm-hmm. So to have someone that is taking things A little bit more slowly... Right. I don't discount his feelings. But for some, it's not hard. And it's not about... I don't discount his feelings at all. When we were sitting at the dinner table, He did say that it's just sometimes harder for a man To tell you that he loves you When you're in a relationship with two people. Mm-hmm. Just experienced a tremendous loss... Mm-hmm. Of his mom. Mm-hmm. And that changed him completely as a person. I think he's the kind of person that needs time To get to that point, but when he gets to the point Of truly being able to say, "I love you," He's gonna mean it. You can't discount him as not being authentic. Chris seems to be very taken with Ali and seems to really love her. It was very clear that he's unwavering D I definitely think that Chris can make Ali happy. In terms of his commitment and love, I think they both love you, but it's ultimately up to you and what you feel. Right, but it comes down to... It's your decision totally. And they are both good guys, It's been a really insightful day with my family. Thank you, guys. Ali, so great to see you again. I'm so glad that my family sees how grateful these guys are.

Everything that Ali and I have been through so far On this journey, From the first night to our day here in Tahiti, It all comes to kind of the pinnacle today. I know love Ali, but I don't wanna get on one knee and propose to Ali Unless I feel 100% sure That Ali's the woman I wanna spend the rest of my life with. I've gotta focus on what I have with her, and that's what's gonna get me through all this. (knock on door) Hey. Hi. How are you? Roberto.E on in. Neil lane. I appreciate you being here. Yeah, well, I'm here to show you a ring. Yeah. Let's step outside if you don't mind. Let's go. Here's the stuff. (laughs) all right. You got to, uh, take it easy on me, 'cause I don't know much about these things. We're gonna go slow. Don't worry. Looking at these rings, thinking about proposing and picking one out, I'm a little bit nervous. The ring represents a lot of stuff. I know this is gonna be the biggest thing in your life. Yeah. Starting a life together with another person. So this is gonna represent that. I wanna make sure that I make the right decision. I mean, you will. Roberto : I always thought about this day, Thought about choosing a ring and taking a big step like this. Wow. This is the one. This is the one. You know, I like that certainty. Once someone takes this journey, there's always those highs. There's also kind of fears. Yeah. I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know for a fact that she's gonna say yes, and that can be really nerve-racking. There's the uncertainty that she's not feeling completely All of these feelings that I'm feeling back. There's just that slight chance, you know? I mean, going through all this and feeling what I'm feeling, I think you have an idea. It'll be a... A hard word to describe it. There's a lot of pressure. I have to take some deep breaths and really think about, is this the right decision to be making? All the best. Thank you. You have to be confident in going into something like this. You have to feel great about it. You have to feel 100%, Like this is the right thing to do. There's a million things going through my mind, Thinking about everything. Am I willing to be that vulnerable? Am I willing to take that chance, To take that step? She told me to trust my heart. She told me to trust what I'm feeling. This moment, to me, is so important. This is definitely the most serious decision I've ever made. I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can propose. I only wanna propose once in my life. If I don't feel like it's the right thing to do, I'm not gonna do it. But one thing I know is that I have to do what's right for me. I have to do what feels right to me. Whatever decision I make, It's gonna change my life, regardless. This is so important to me, So important to her. I don't want to make that mistake If it's the wrong thing. (exhales deeply) Ali : I don't know what's going to happen today, and that's scary and exciting all at the same time. I had no idea that everything would end up this way. I wanted to me here and risk everything for love, and today I've taken that ultimate risk. Roberto : I'm always gonna be true to myself, and if I give something up, It's because I feel so strongly That things are gonna change for the better. Ali : the road I had to take to get here Has been difficult in ways That I had not prepared myself for and could never have imagined would happen. I think that's the crazy thing about love, Is that it works in ways that we can't explain, and it's just something you feel, and I feel it stronger than I ever thought that I could. ♪ Roberto : this is definitely the most serious and difficult decision I've had to make. I've gone through a lot of emotions and a lot of thoughts, and it gives me confidence that I'm doing the right thing. Ali : I don't think it's possible To Le someone until you can give your whole heart to them. I'm in love with Roberto, and that feels so good. But there's always that fear That he won't love me back. I'm so happy that I finally found the guy I wanna spend my life with, and I'm nervous because Roberto's it. He's all I have left, and I have to just have faith in our relationship and faith that he cares about me as much as I care about him. The rose I give out today will symbolize My whole heart, my life, my love, and I wanna give it to Roberto. I'd be heartbroken if Roberto didn't want me back In the way that I want him. But I just have to have faith that he will. (wind whistling) ♪ Ali : every relationship I've had in my life Has led up to this moment right here, right now. (exhales deeply) And... I'm 100% certain with all of my heart That Roberto's the man for me. I can only hope he feels the same way. I'm feeling very nervous. There's no guarantee today. I have one guy here, and I'm putting everything I have into him Because I love him. I hope Roberto gets down on one knee and asks me to be his wife. But I don't know if Roberto's gonna propose today, and he right now doesn't know that he's the only guy here. I just have faith us. Roberto. Chris, how are you? Good to see you again. Doing well. Likewise. Good. Come on up. Right here. All right. All right, Roberto, Ali's waiting at the top of the stairs. Okay. Good luck. Thank you. I appreciate that, Chris. Head on up. All right. Roberto : it's scary going into this. I have never done this much thinking in my life and soul searching. I think you have to trust your gut a lot In these circumstances. I'm gonna take a deep breath, stand up tall, Look in her eyes, tell her how I feel and mean every word that I say. In a situation like this, It's difficult to really make that decision... What the right decision is. I've been anxious for a long time, For this moment. (sighs) It took a lot of thinking and a lot of soul searching For me to get there. Hi. Hey, beautiful. Hi. How you doing? Good. (whispers) so good to s you. (normal voice) my heart is pounding right now. (heart beats rapidly) Um... I, uh, I wanted to To just say a couple things first, and, uh... I was thinking all night last night, and I was thinking all this morning. So many things going through my head... You can only imagine. And I wanted to make sure that I made the right decision For the both of us. Mm-hmm. And I thought to myself when you told me, "make the right decision. Follow your heart," And I kept playing it over and over in my mind. I wanna tell you I came into this... I didn't know what to expect, and I walked out of the limousine that first night... Everything you said and our first dance and... You know, you giving me the first impression rose... (giggles) that was amazing.
