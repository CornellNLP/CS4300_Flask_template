 Tonight on The Bachelorette... 
 Ali : It's so beautiful. 
 Ali : I'm really happy that Roberto's here. 
 Are you ready to fall for me? 
 Are you ready to fall for me? 
 I am. Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 My first kiss with Roberto on the wire was Unlike any other kiss I've ever had. 
 Aah! 
 Whoa! 
 ♪ it's been one week ♪ 
 (cheering) 
 Jonathan : this is so cool. 
 These guys are my favorite band. 
 With your help, we're gonna make the music video today. 
 Whoo! 
 Action. 
 Jonathan : our scene today was Really an emotional moment for me. 
 Frank : there was a lot of kissing. 
 I mean, how could I not be jealous? 
 Oh, my gosh. She's also hugging you and kissing your neck. 
 Man : it's starting to kill me to watch these guys That I think might not be here for her. 
 This should be pretty intense, man. 
 You know, knowing that she's just right down the road and you can't just hop in the car and drive down there and see her. 
 Justin : it's actually crucial that I have alone time with Ali. 
 Looks like I need your help a little bit. 
 Justin : this is a huge move. 
 This is gonna kind of change the whole tone of the house. 
 I don't trust your intentions. 
 I'm 100% here for her. 
 We see one thing. 
 She sees something else. 
 Ty : is everybody wrong? 
 Dude, who exactly are we talking about? 
 You. 
 I'm kinda getting pissed off about this. 
 I don't normally swear, but this is getting (bleep) ridiculous. 
 Ty : karma's a bitch. 
 Whoever has anything to say to me, bring it. 
 Ty : it's gonna come back and get you. 
 Man : oh, my God. 
 Chris Harrison : guys, if you would, Come join me in the living room. 
 Man : good morning, Chris. 
 Hi, guys. Good morning. 
 Men : good morning. 
 14 of you left. 
 And hopefully, one of you will be her fiance. 
 So let's talk about this week. 
 There will be one group date, two individual dates. 
 Once again, Ali will have a rose to hand out on each date. 
 If you get a rose, you're safe through the next rose ceremony, Nothing to worry about. 
 The individual dates... if you do not get a rose, You'll be going home immediately, So pack your bags just in case. 
 Before I leave, a word of advice. 
 Like last week, not everybody here will have a date with Ali. 
 So when you get time with her... whether it's on a date, Here at the house, wherever... take full advantage. 
 It might be the only time you have with her. 
 First date card right here. 
 Enjoy the week, and I hope to see all of you at the next rose ceremony. 
 Have a good one, fellas. 
 Man : thanks, Chris. 
 All right, fellas. 
 (saks indistinctly) 
 Roberto. 
 Man : Whoo! Yeah! 
 (man speaks indistinctly) 
 "love is a balancing act. 
 Ali." 
 Man : love is a balancing act. 
 Roberto : I was pumped. 
 I woke up this morning, and I felt like today I was gonna get a date. 
 Whoo! 
 Hopefully it goes really great, and she'll just send everybody else home. (laughs) 
 Well, that is just a real nice surprise for Roberto. 
 (laughter) 
 John : Roberto is a lucky man right now. 
 I have not been on a date yet, um, and at this point in time, I have no idea if Ali even remembers my name. 
 Ali : I gave Roberto the first impression rose, and since then, I haven't seen much of him. 
 You know, I have this picture in my mind Of sort of who Roberto is and what we could have together, So I think the worst thing that could happen is to find out I built him up in my mind as being this, like, Great, amazing guy, and then what if it turns out he's not? 
 Man : oh, there she is. 
 Oh! 
 Ali : hi, guys. 
 Wow. 
 Hey. (laughs) how are you? 
 How's it going? 
 Good. 
 You look good. 
 Thank you. You do, too. 
 I'm excited for today. 
 It's gonna be a good day. 
 Oh, I'm super pumped. 
 I've been stoked. 
 Am I driving? We're not going by land. We're going by air. 
 Roberto : no way! 
 (laughs) 
 Yes! Oh! 
 Man : that is awesome. 
 Ali : yeah. 
 You look up and see this helicopter Coming right down out of the sky. 
 And I was feeling, man, you know, I would love that chance To... to go for a helicopter ride with Ali. 
 Bye, guys. (laughs) 
 I really wanted it badly to be myself in the helicopter, Because Ali's scared to fly, So you know she's probably holding on to somebody, and I don't figure it was gonna be the pilot. 
 (man speaks indistinctly) 
 Ali : I've been scared of flying For a very long time. 
 I've never been in a helicopter before. 
 It's terrifying. 
 Ali : oh, my God. 
 But Roberto just hugged me and... and cuddled me and made me feel safe. 
 Now I remember why I gave him the first impression rose That night. 
 (laughs) 
 Roberto is so protective and manly. 
 You know, he could really be the guy for me. 
 Ali : it's so beautiful. 
 Roberto : the helicopter lands, That if she has any dates that are adventurous, To, uh, go ahead and save those for me if she's gonna do it. 
 So I'm thinking it's gonna be something fun. 
 Tonight we are gonna be having dinner. 
 The thing is, dinner is over there. 
 I see the table. 
 And there's only one way to get there, and that's across these little wires. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 This is gonna be crazy. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 So what do you think, Steve? 
 What are you gonna do for the evening? 
 My date that doesn't exist? 
 (laughs) 
 Oh, I just hope to get one. 
 With a beautiful lady. 
 Can't beat it. 
 Watching Ali fly away with Roberto in the helicopter... 
 Was, uh, I mean, it was tough. 
 It gives me that gut-wrenching feeling That I'd rather not have, but I'd like to be having as much fun as he is right now. 
 I'm just gonna be patient. 
 There you go. 
 You know what? 
 At this point, you know, I-I'm, like, desperate with time with Ali... 
 I know. We all are. 
 So even if she came up in a little bicycle, and I had to ride shotgun, you know, I'd still take that and appreciate every second I have with her. 
 But I honestly think if I don't get my cast off sooner or later, I'm gonna be the one not getting a rose at the end of the day. 
 It's tough for you, yeah, obviously. 
 It's... it's huge. 
 I'm at a deficit. 
 ♪ 
 (laughs) oh, my God. 
 Ali : I cannot believe I'm about to walk 100 feet Across this little, tiny wire 20 stories above L.A. 
 This is crazy. 
 If you get nervous, lo over at me, and, uh, you'll be good. 
 Experiencing this with Roberto is really important to me Because life is challenging, and there's gonna be obstacles to overcome, and I want to be with someone That wants to help me get through those things. 
 And going through something stressful with someone Shows you who they really are and what kind of character they have. 
 Are you ready to fall for me? 
 Absolute... Let's do it. 
 Are you ready to fall for me? 
 I am. Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Your legs are good. 
 Are they holding up? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Ali : being 20 stories up in the air was terrifying, A lot worse than a helicopter. 
 Whoo! 
 You good? 
 Don't... don't fall off on your toes. 
 Whoo! 
 Ali : I look down, and there's, like, cars on the street and people down there, and, like, anything could happen. 
 Something could really go wrong. 
 (siren wails in distance) 
 I want to give you something, if you don't mind. 
 Me? 
 Can you turn? 
 I think this is, uh... 
 (groans) aah! 
 Oh! 
 Aah! Hold on. Hold on. 
 I got it. 
 Good job. Got it? 
 Okay. 
 (laughs) 
 Mm. 
 Mm. 
 Whoa. I got you. 
 I got you. I got you. 
 See? You're making me fall for you. (laughs) 
 I got you. I got you. 
 Okay. 
 Ali : my first kiss with Roberto was unlike any other kiss I've ever had. 
 Once again, Roberto just made me feel really good and safe up there, and having someone that makes me feel safe, Um, in really scary situations is really comforting. 
 That's the type of person I want to go through life with. 
 And... We're off. 
 Go. 
 Aah! (laughs) 
 But I'm definitely looking forward to my next kiss With Roberto with our two feet planted firmly on the ground. 
 (cork pops) 
 Whoo! (laughs) 
 Roberto : Ali and I definitely have a connection at this point. 
 When I look into Ali's eyes, it's captivating. 
 It makes me think about what could be. 
 Wow. 
 Well, I can say this to you... 
 I really hope to watch a lot more of these with you. 
 Man : you guys think he's getting a rose? 
 Ty : you take off in a helicopter, You better be getting a rose. 
 Chris L. : I still don't have a date, and Roberto gets a one-on-one date. 
 Um, I'm stuck in the house with 14 other dudes. 
 I want to go out there and make an adventure with her. 
 (knock on door) 
 Man : what you got there, buddy? 
 Man : looky here, huh? 
 (cheering) 
 All right, let's see what we got here, fellas. 
 "kirk." 
 Whoo! 
 "john." 
 (cheering) 
 "Chris n. Frank." 
 Man : all right, Frank. 
 (Frank grunts) 
 "Jonathan. Craig." 
 Justin." all right, sweet. Jesse. Chris l." yeah! 
 I just got a date. 
 First one. 
 I get to see Ali outside of the house for once, So I'm pretty excited. 
 Here we go. 
 "come rock my world. Ali." 
 Man : whoa! 
 "come rock my world," huh? 
 Karaoke. 
 I think they're gonna go do something That has to do with music. 
 It sucks 'cause I would have loved to go and sing and show Ali my voice a little bit. That'd be pretty fun. 
 I can't wait for that one-on-one time. 
 I'd love to sing her a song from the heart. 
 ♪ 
 Thank you, Ali, for having me here today and choosing me to go on the date and, um, showing me an amazing time. Thank you. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers to a really good first date. 
 Absolutely. 
 Buen provecho. 
 That's good... Bon appétit. 
 Are you completely fluent in Spanish? Can you speak? 
 That's my first language. 
 It is? I went in at kindergarten, I didn't know a word of English. Wow. Yeah. I can speak a little Italian, a little French. (laughs) what? Yeah, I don't know. I had a thing for languages. Like, you know, growing up, in High School, I took French. And then I wanted to travel to Italy, So then I learned a little bit of Italian. You have been everywhere. (chuckles) I think Roberto's really interesting. He just has done so many things. He speaks different languages. He's traveled. He is a cultured guy, and that is so sexy. You surprise me in such good ways. You're a really good-looking guy. I don't think you know even how good-looking you are. Uh... Thanks. Um... I don't think there's any question That this date is going amazing. Roberto's so beautiful That I almt wonder does he think I'm pretty enough for him? And I feel nervous. That's pretty big for me. Not many guys can make me feel that way. I feel like I have a connection with you already That I'm really happy about. Good. I was gonna ask you. Yeah, good. I'm really, really bad at hiding my emotions. When I'm happy, you'll know. Yeah. When I'm upset, you'll know. When I'm bored, you'll know. (laughs) What do I seem like now? Smiling, which is good. (laughs) Roberto is so great, and dinner with him is perfect, but I don't like being all stiff and at a table, So I want to get a little bit more cozy with Roberto. I'm a big cuddler. I can always tell whether or not I can... Be with someone by how I cuddle with them. How is it right now? It's good. It's good? Mm-hmm. You know how cute you are? Like, do you know how cute you can be? (laughs) Roberto : I feel, like, A really, really strong connection right now. I'm just excited. The skyline, everything, is wonderful, but more so than anything, it's just being with Ali. And this is probably wrong, and I leard it from a rap song, but... (laughs) (laughs) DA UN beso. (giggles) mm. Ali asked me to, uh, DA UN beso. Definitely a good thing to hear in Spanish... to give me a kiss." I'm never gonna deny her one of those. You're missing something. (laughs) What am I missing? (laughs) (chuckles) I was like, what is she talking about? (laughs) (sighs) I real enjoyed today, Really. And, um, I don't think I acted so scared When I was on that tightrope because I was next to you. (chuckles) you know, my first impression of you was so good, and I thought, how could this guy get better? And every minute I'm with you, I think you're getting better, and I'm just excited to get to know you more. I want to know if you accept this rose and continue on this journey with me. Absolutely. Gracias. Mm. I'm really happy that Roberto's here, and I feel hopeful For this journey and that it's gonna work out in the end. Don't forget about me. I won't. Don't forget about this, please, 'cause I won't. Thank you for the rose. Kissing Ali is unbelievable. It just feels so right. I'm on cloud nine right now. I just got a rose and, uh, I think I could definitely Be the guy who, uh, she spends the rest of her life with. Coming up... They're gonna be shooting their music video. Man : no way! We're all in it. Whoo! Man : action. Frank : there's a lot of kissing going on in these scenes. I can't stand by and watch it happen. There's gonna be a fight cue, and the scene didn't even call for it. I've not seen her all week except when she came To pick another dude up. I would do anything to, you know, spend time with her. Well, too bad you're not, buddy. Justin : I'm planning to sneak out of the mansion and go visit Ali. It doesn't matter what happens, how long it takes. I'm definitely gonna see her today. What are you doing here? (groans) What are you guys doing today? We're supposed to rock her world. That's what the date card says. There's nine of us. I'm psyched to go on the date today. I mean, I had my one-on-one date with her. That was more exciting, obviously. Hanging out with all of these guys and her... It'll be a different experience, but I feel so confident In that connection I have with Ali, That I'm not worried about it. Yeah. (speaks indistinctly) ♪ Chris L. : this is a sketchy-looking area. What the hell are we doing out here? So we're driving through L.A. We pulled up, and, uh, Ali's standing right in the middle of the street. It looks like a deserted area in the middle of L.A., Like, where'd there'd be, like, gang wars. So none of us have a clue what's gonna happen next. Hey! How are ya? Good. How are you? Good to see you. You look great. Thanks. You, too. Ali : the guys were probably really confused When they got in the limo. We're in the middle of nowhere. They're probably wondering what are we doing here? (speaks indistinctly) hi, how are you? I'm good. Even though it's definitely not the most romantic place, I get to surprise the guys with something I don't think any of us have done before. What the heck are we doing here? Well, you'll see. I actually have a bit of a surprise for you guys today. So, uh, come on. Let's walk down this way. Man : I'm nervous. (indistinct conversations) Ali : maybe a little bit. Oh! Nice!

Justin : are you nervous? Are you nervous? Yeah, I'm a little... I'm anxious. Yeah, I'm anxious about it. Anxious? First kiss. (Craig) weatherman has a scene with Ali Where he has to actually kiss her in the middle of the scene, and heas nerus. I couldn't relate to that Because I could only dream of being in a scene like that. Just think of it as you're doing, like, a forecast. But you just... you just... in the middle of the forecast, You have to make out with a girl. (groans) I'm sweating. Man : places, everyone. Today we're shooting a music video For barenaked ladies for their song you run away."

Who's one? Who's got, like... who's going first? Man : Frank. Frank seems to always go first, doesn't he? I mean, he gets to get the first one-on-one date, and now he gets the first, uh, scene with her in this thing. I know. What's up with that? Frank : I absolutely love being the first At everything with Ali. I hope I will always be The first at everything with Ali. I-I love it. It's a good feeling. Everybody gets a scripted kiss. I earned my kiss, fellas. You know, I do think Ali and Frank have chemistry. I mean, you can just tell when you're around them That she definitely does like him, but, you know, I don't think for one second that she is sold That he is the one she wants to be with. Frank, let's get you in position. We're gonna take it from the top. Stand by. And mark. And action. Look at him stride. Hey, baby. Hey. Mind if I sit here? Please sit. Gorgeous day. Ah. Gorgeous woman. Chris L. : cheese ball. John : cheese. It's funny because, you know, I'm sitting there oiling her up, and the way she's looking at me, I can tell it has nothing to do with the scene. Man : and in three, two... (gasps and laughs) (laughs) I can't. Let's try that again. All right, Ali, I think you should be hitting him harder than that. I think so. Scene one, take two. (gas) Oh, there you go. That's how to do it. I wanted Ali to slap Frank. I wanted, like, 48 takes of that. Man : scene one, take three. Slap the crap off of him. We did nine takes of that. (gasps) Nine takes of Ali slapping me across the face. Kirk : that never gets old. No. I've never been slapped by a girl before. Another first with Ali. There we eight scenes. Uh, mine was the only one that had no contact with Ali. Man : well, that's a wrap on scene two. Moving on to three. After I finished, I was like, really? That's it? I was definitely kinda wondering, you know, When's it gonna be my turn? Jonathan : I was very nervous About going into this scene with Ali. I wanted it to be really good. Um, I had to kiss her for the first time In front of a whole bunch of people. Weatherman, just don't worry. There's no pressure. No one's watching you. It's natural to have your first kiss in a library. (laughs) in front of 50 strangers. Jonathan : actors do stage kisses all the time, but I don't want it to feel like a stage kiss. I want this kiss with Ali to feel real. Man : ow! Man : ooh. Wow. Look at you. Kirk : very intelligent. Can you just walk right up here for me, guys? Could I... yeah, I just want to talk for one quick second. I think he's asking not to do it. Okay. Okay. It'll be okay. Okay. The scene with Jonathan in the library  Started off very awkward. He was shaking. He was literally physically shaking. And I was just like, "oh, it's fine. It's okay." And I'm sitting there thinking,  I don't know if I'm ready to kiss Jonathan. I bet you... hey, I bet you... I'm calling it right now... I bet you it's a neck kiss, That he's gonna kiss her on the neck. Man : stand by. Mark it. Action. Ali : so we do the first scene, and he kind of spins me around. And I think he's supposed to kiss me, but he doesn't, So I kinda go in and awkwardly kiss him, and I don't know. It was all wrong. Man : okay, cut. (kirk) Jon, I-I think you're supposed to kiss her. Man : quiet on the set. The general reaction of Ali's scene with the weatherman Was kinda, like, disgust. It was just, like, it was painful. Stand by, everyone. Quiet on the set. Man : and this time, I want to see a little bit more emotion, Jon. Ah! Chris L. : oh, jeez. (snickers) You play weatherman. I'll play Ali. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. (chuckles) Jonathan : you guys are embarrassing her. Stop it. You're embarrassing me. We're not saying anything. We'll be quiet. Ali : I saw Jonathan get really upset. He started crying, I think because all the guys kinda laughed at him. And I felt so bad. You okay? Oh, yeah, I'm good. (chuckles) I just went up and I gave him a hug. And then in the next scene, I made sure to just pull him in and give him a really good, passionate kiss. (book thuds) Man : Whoo! Man : Whoo! Man : ha! Man : ha ha! When Ali kissed me, I just sort of, like... Like a rocket ship, just... just, uh, blew up emotionally. It's... it feels great. It's a good connection. And I was like, whoa, that has to be real. Man : thank you. Woman : Whoo! Man : good job. That was fun. Today was a big day of firsts for the weatherman... You know, first kiss with Ali, first kiss in a music video, First kiss... Ever. (chuckles) Man : scene four, take one. Man : oh, there they go. I miss getting slapped. So these other guys are doing their music video scenes, and I'm taking a look at 'em, and I'm noticing There's a lot of kissing going on in these scenes. That Jesse/Ali scene Got a little, uh, little... a little intimate. Frank : Chris n. Has a scene where he's in bed with Ali. How could I not be jealous? I mean, I am jealous. Oh, my gosh. But she's also hugging you and kissing your neck. Oh, did I leave that part out? Yeah, you did leave that part out. (laughs) Frank : I'd like to think that any chemistry it looks like Those other guys are having with Ali During their scene is acting. That's what I'm thinking. So, you know, as much as they might love that kiss, I kissed her for real. Action. Man : kirk. (chuckles) hey. Hey. My scene with Ali didn't seem like a scene at all. I... truthfully, I felt like I was there. I felt like it was real. I was not worried about anybody else in the room. I didn't give a crap That there were cameras filming a music video. All I was focusing on was Ali. Man : cut. Cut. Frank : kirk kissed Ali In their music video scene, Ani feel like she might have felt Like theres something else there instead of just acting. And now I feel, for the first time, like... And it's... it's hard for me to really define it yet... But I feel like something is not right. If kirk gets the rose tonight, it's gonna kill me. If you'd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor" or the bachelorette," Go to bachelor. ABC.Com and click apply." Man : oh, my God! Man : what is going on? Today was a great day. Definitely, I think, the best group date. It was easier for me because I knew the guys, and we got to do something so fun. I'm looking forward to tonight. I'm gonna ke the guys to a wrap party. Whoo! Man : oh, my God. Jesse : we went up to the penthouse. It was beautiful. The view was insane. But the view is nothing compared to, uh, you know, Ali's look. Do you believe that we actually got to make a music video today? Like, that's insane. Man : pretty amazing, yeah. Man : that's ridiculous. Cheers to ourselves just lookin' hot. Men : cheers. Awesome. On that note... I'm gonna grab you. Oh, yeah? Wanna go have a chat? Man : right away. Let's do it. Where we headed? I was like, yes. About time I get some time with this girl. How you doin'? Not too bad. I would love to get the rose tonight. And, uh, considering it's my first date, One-on-one time is important. Okay, we've all had a really limited time To spend with Ali today. There was a couple of us that got kisses, including myself. I kissed Ali. And I'm just thinking, Do you think that was enough to make a connection? The competition's heating up a little bit. Kirk was really excited about the time he spent with her In their music video scene. I still have confidence in this connection that Ali and I have, but I'm starting to, like, feel a little uneasy. Well, I think it's interesting you bring that up. I mean, your kissing her is part of a scene, kirk. It's part of a scene. But... but here's the thing. Like, if she can tell me That, you know, that felt real... absolutely. Are you gonna ask her when you pull her aside? (man) oh. You're gonna ask, "did you feel what I felt... " I would be an absolute idiot if I did not ask her If she felt the same way I did. Oh! I remember what I wanted to ask you about, 'cause I know you told me Your tattoo is your mom's signature, right? Yep. How... what made you decide to do that? Well, I don't know if I told you, My family's super, super important to me. Uh-huh. And, uh, without gettin' too deep, She passed away about a year and a half ago. Mm. Um, so when that happened, it was like... like, crushed me, So, uh, I actually took the deed of our house Into a tattoo place, and I said... Oh. "listen, I want her signature blown up and have it start on my heart and wrap around." Yeah, I didn't plan on bringingo and... and the significance of it tonight. (voice breaks) it's not an easy topic. When my mom passed away, I wasn't ready for anything. And now, you know, a year and a half later, You know, it's great to be able to put myself out there again, but at the same time it's scary 'cause it's been a while and... You know, whenever you put yourself out there, There's a chance you... you could get hurt. It just... I don't know. I want you to get to know first. Yeah. Um, and then... That sounds good. I'll start telling you some stories. When Chris l. Was telling me about his tattoo with his mom, I get the feeling that isn't really comfortable To talk about it yet, and that's okay. You know, all I know right now is that I really like him. And I'd rather He shares something like that with me when we have more time. Hey. Oh! (chuckles) I was hoping to talk to you. Can I steal you away? (Ali laughs) I need time with Ali tonight To talk about our scene earlier today. How are you? Good. I'm good. How are you? I am great. Thank you very much. (laughs) she kissed me at the video shoot, and there's a lot, kind of, for me, emotionally going on, and I wanna explain that to her, and I want that rose tonight. So I wanted to... I wanted to talk to you about today. Mm-hmm. 'cause I was like... I was just nervous. And I wanted us to be... mm-hmm. You were nervous. I could tell. You were telling me you were shaking a little bit. Yeah, so... And I didn't mean... I felt really bad 'cause I thought, Oh, my gosh. I'm making him uncomfortable. No. I had... no, 'cause look, I understand. Because I just... they were watching. So I was like, ugh! They were. It was... it was... No, I was... I felt bad 'cause I... yeah.

When Craig did his little move on me, I was a little annoyed. But you know what? I feel like each time I get to see Ali and spend some time with her, Our connection grows.

Oh, it's warm. (chuckles) it is a hot tub. I atctually hurts, doesn't it, a little bit? (laughs) Going into my time with Ali, uh, I wanna make sure that the kiss during the music video, Uh, was felt by her, too, 'cause I definitely felt it.

I just needed this to solidify it. Oh! You give me the shivers, and I'm in a hot tub. Kirk has this energy, that it just draws me to him and it makes me feel comfortable around him.

Might have to pull something out of my sleeve, you know, In the next couple of days, uh, to make sure, you know, I do get that rose at the end of the week. I had a really good date today, and I had some really great conversations. Uh... The person I'm gonna give the rose to tonight is... Kirk. (laughs) Thank you. Will you accept this rose?

The guys would turn on me in two seconds If they found out that I went to Ali's place today. I haven't seen you in the last, like, 20 hours. I know. I was sleepin'. It's all about attention, right? Why don't you just crucify me right now? I'd totally made up my mind on you, dude. I haven't seen her all week. Not seen her all week  Except when she came to pick another dude up To take him somewhere. It's hard to, like, stay in your own space with her... Do you know what I mean? And not let everything else kinda deflate you a little bit. Justin : in order for me to stay in the house, It's actually crucial that I have alone time with Ali. So I'm gonna try and somehow figure out Wheri can get a little bit extra time with her.

Doesn't Matt what happens, how long it takes... I'm definitely gonna see her today. Do you know where Ali lives? You know, it doesn't matter If she lives a mile, 5 miles, 10 miles away. Bottom line is, I'm willing to do anything to get a rose from Ali... Even if it kills me. I don't care what happens or what comes in my way. I'm willing to do anything, absolutely anything, If that means At the end of the day I'm the last guy standing. Woman : tell me why you picked hunter for the date today. I picked hunter for the date today Because our relationship has just been so up and down. I really think This could be sort of a make it or break it time. All he has to do is hang out with me. That's it. And if he can't... Man : we need to cut? Woman : yeah. Wait. Whoa. (Justin whispers) oh. Oh, my gosh! (laughs) how's it goin'? What are you doing here? (singsongy) surprise! How are you, sweetheart? Oh, my gosh! Oh, wait. I'm all sweaty though. Ugh! Did you walk all... how did you get here? I basically walked from the mansion. Justin : she was shocked, you know. And seeing her face, you know, it was all worth it and, uh, definitely helped out my chances to get a rose. And at the end of the week, I'll still be standing, and there'll be three, four, maybe five guys out that door. I-I just don't like the fact that, you know, I'm kinda being, like, held back because of my foot. And I wanted you to know, like... like, I'm... I'm the real deal. Mm-hmm. The reason why I'm here is, you know, it... it's for you. Oh, my goodness. I cannot believe you! Thank you! (laughs) oh, my gosh! Mmm. But wait. I have one request, though. Mm-hmm? Just one thing.

And it's a little crazy, and I like that. That's definitely a turn-on. It was a challenge, but it was definitely... It was definitely worth the challenge. You know, and... I'm so glad you did. I feel bad, but, like... (laughs) (laughs) I'm... I'm so glad you did. Oh! No, don't. Absolutely not. I just can't even believe it. I'm so flattered that he would do that for me, and I appreciate it. No one has ever done anything like that for me. That is crazy. Good. There. There's a first. I actually brought some photos... Yes! To share with you... Oh, I love that. So you know kind of where I'm kind of from, and because, you know, the women in my life... You know, my grandmother, my mom, my little sister... They're... they mean the world to me. You were such a cute little guy! So, yeah, so that's me and my mom. My gorgeous mom. She's beautiful. That's actually when my mom got married to my Dad. Uh, they're not together anymore? No. They got a divorce I think about four or five years after. Mm-hmm. I've always said, you know, I've always had two moms... My grandmother and my mom. Mm-hmm. You know, and... do you not keep in touch with him anymore? No. Even though, literally, by drive, He lived about six minutes away from where we lived, He would never come see us. Mm-hmm. And when I got to the point where I was old enough, I'm like, "you know what, mom? I don't need him in my life." And then, um, he passed away. Wow. So not... Being too forward with everything... No. Please. But... but being, you know, how impor... be forward. That's what I'm looking for. But, like, that's how important kids are. Because, you know, I didn't have a father figure in my life. But I-I can look back and, you know, and say, "you know what? Having a father figure is really important." Justin really opened up. He told me about his Dad. And it was heartbreaking. He's been through a lot growing up, and I'm glad that he feels comfortable enough Telling me about it. I... yeah. You're gonna be a good daddy. I gotta be a... I don't have any other choice. I-I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I wasn't. You know? Oh. Give me a hug. Oh. (speaks indistinctly) yeah. Oh, come here. I-I'm really thankful I was able to, you know, Sneak away from the guys To get some one-on-one time with Ali. I hope hunter doesn't get, you know, upset with me Because I'm kind of butting in On his one-on-one time today and his one-on-one date. But you gotta do what you gotta do.

If I don't get some one-on-one time, man, I'm done. Yeah. Kasey : I'm jealous, man. The other one-on-ones started a little earlier than mine, but a one-on-one is a one-on-one. I'm ready for me to open up and for her to see that, you know. That's, you know, that's the toughest part, man, Is putting yourself out there. I can't wait to have more than 20 minutes with the girl. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's... I'm a... I'm a slow-paced kid. So if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. If not, then maybe I'm not coming home. But I have a feeling that it is meant to be and I'm... I'm definitely coming home. There's a rose on today's date, and if I don't get that rose, I'm going home. So far, there's been three people on one-on-ones and they've all come home, and I'm gonna make it 4-for-4. Ali : it doesn't surprise me that Justin came to visit me. All right.

I definitely think the guys would Turn on me in two seconds If they found out that I went to Ali's place today. But, you know, at the end of the day, I really don't care what they think. This is a huge move. This is gonna kind of change the whole tone in the house and it's gonna shake everyone up a little bit. You know, everyone's got to step up their game and, uh, it's a little bit more of a competition Than everyone thinks. Mission accomplished. Coming up... You know he came to my house, right? No. Justin walked over to her house yesterday. What? We see one thing. She sees something else. To me, Justin's two-faced. If you're one way with her and another way with us, It's just wrong. Dude, who exactly are we talking about? You. I love today. Today's such a great day. Man : yes. I haven't see you in the last, like, 20 hours. I know. I was sleepin'. I'm ready to get the show on the road. Sick of waitin'. Justin : do you think you get to go to her house? I don't know. No idea. I'm thinkin' yeah. I'm thinking we're gonna go to her house. At first, I thought we were going to San Francisco. But the later the day went by, I think we might be just having a relaxed day at her place. Which actually could be good for you, 'cause you can get a chance to, you know, you can just relax. That's all I need, buddy. (hunter) I'm nervous but it's a good nervous. On our group date, I felt like I choked. I think she's realized that I'm more of a guy that There needs to be some one-on-one time Which is just between me and her. And hopefully I do have the time to get to ow her. It just sucks that the date's starting so late. It is startin' late. It's gonna be cool, calm and collected, Then we're just gonna get t. Justin : it's kinda weird kind of coming back to the house and watching hunter get all excited for his date. He's like, oh, you know, it must be great Being the only guy to go see Ali in her house. Well, mnh-mnh. Sorry. Beat you to that one. I think it'll be, uh, As romantic as you could get. I think it's gonna be good. Yeah. No, I'd love to be in your shoes. I would do anything to, you know, spend time with her Inside her house like that. Well, too bad you're not, buddy. (laughs) Man : oh! Ohh! Man : Whoo! Hey, hey, hey! (Ali laughs) Ali, how are you, sweetheart? Good, good. Hi. Good. How are you? All right. Let's go. Man : have fun. See ya. Ty : y'all have fun. Bye, guys. This date is a make it or break it date for hunter. And I think the fact that Justin walked all the way up here does Kind of steal a little thunder away from hunter tonight. Here's my place. (chuckles) it's not too far up the road. I like it, baby. This is awesome. (laughs) Welcome. Thank you. No problem. Are you hungry yet? Yeah, I could eat. Maybe we should just dive right in then. There aren't a lot of distractions On my date with hunter tonight. We're not going to see the Hollywood sign Or going to Vegas. We're just staying home. And it's gonna be a really good opportunity for us to see What a life together would be like. (laughs) (big band music playing) I don't think I've ever worn an apron in my life. You just... I already... I just feel like I can cook wearing this. You look gorgeous. It's, like, magical. I'm not... I'm not wearing that. (laughs) no, you... come on! Put it on. It's your turn. Kinda feel like I'm wearing a dress. (laughs) In a gown? It looks good. (laughs) The comfort level has definitely gotten better. It started off good. She was giggling. I was giggling. Everything felt more relaxed. I feel like such a homemaker. (laughs) Look at you. So are your parents still married now? Mnh-mnh. No? No. Are yours? Were you married? They got divorced when I was 6. See, I feel so bad for my Dad. Like, he gave up a lot so my mom could go to nursing school When we were growing up. Yeah. So he's just never really been able to focus on his career. And I think maybe that's some of the reason That I'm so career... Driven? Yeah, yeah. Driven, and I have had a hard time Sort of giving my career up for love, Because I feel like I don't want, you know, I see... You don't... you've got your own plans in life, and you didn't wanna kind of mess that up. Yeah. I mean, I love... I love what I do as well. But I'm more than happy doing what I'm doing now... Cooking and cleaning and taking care of the kids and... (laughs) I mean, if you're happy working all the time, As long as you come back and kiss me good night when you come home, That's fine with me, you know? I'm more of a slow-paced guy, and you only have A couple hours of really getting to know each other. And I wanna make sure That Ali sees the person that I actually am. This is really good. Good job. Very good. Thanks, darling. Cheers to you, babe. And I must get... Oh, thank you. Cheers to our first date. I think, uh, you couldn't have done a better job On picking this date for me as well. Mm. Hunter and Ali are literally, like... We could probably walk there if we had some time. But even walking there would take a couple of hours. It's... For you. Well, hey. Yeah. It would definitely take me two hours to walk over there. But I'm telling you, I would even walk over there To spend on... some one-on-one time with her. For the record, this is my prediction. Deep down inside, I don't think Ali's gonna give him a rose, and we're gonna see his bags being packed off For the first time. Do you see yourself ending up with Ali over hunter? Yes. Okay. Why? Absolutely. Because I think I-I'm a little bit more passionate, A little bit more forward about my emotions towards her. I can't see Ali with hunter at the end of the day. ♪ (hunter) Ahh.

(Craig) so how you feeling tonight? I'm... I'm feeling good. Yeah? I'm feeling good. You had one-on-one time with her, right? What day are you talking about, one-on-one time? Group date. Oh, the group date. That's right. Um, yeah, you know, We had some one-on-one time together, and, uh, you know, I'll... I'll put it this way. The one-on-one time that I've had with Ali this week Has been amazing. Nice. I definitely feel safe for tonight's rose ceremony, Because after my visit with Ali, and, you know, After my big struggle to go see her, if I went home tonight, I literally... I'd probably fall over on my crutches. So you feel pretty confident. Eh, you know, if I don't walk away with a rose, I would really be shocked. (Craig) Justin talks like he has a lot of confidence, I'm not sure quite why. I wouldn't be surprised by anything tonight. Man : Whoo! Man : hey. (laughs) (man) wow. Hi, guys. Hello. Well, last night was really difficult for me. Uh, hunter's such a good guy, and I really enjoy being around him. (sighs) But I'm here to find the person that I want to marry, and when I looked at hunter, I didn't see my husband. So... Cheers to hunter, 'cause he's such a good guy. Man : cheers to hunter, absolutely. Cheers also to continuing on in this journey. Thanks, guys. Cheers. I've been confident in every decision that I've made To let someone go home. It's always hard Because I don't want to hurt anyone, but I am very confident that my future husband is in that room. Be careful. (squeals) the last time I saw Chris, he really opened upbout his mom, and, you know, tonight I just wanna have A fun, lighthearted conversation with him. You look good tonight. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Thank you. So if we could do something next, you d me, What... what would you want to do? I love oysters, and, uh, like, steamers. I love oysters. Me, too. Really? I think we like all those kinds of foods Especially since we're close to Maine and, like, lobster. We have to, yeah. Yeah, lobster. Oh, I love lobster tails. Oh. I'm looking forward to flying to Maine for fresh lobster. (laughs) so that would be your date... Maine for fresh lobster. You know, Maine. Do you play basketball? Like, what do you do When you're hanging out with your boys? Oh, we're always constantly doing something, Like playing Frisbee or basketball Or, like, summer, we set up, like, a flip cup table  In our front yard. We put, like, a spotlight hanging down. I am so good at flip cup! So good. I got second place in Las Vegas last month for that tournament. What? Yeah. I would like to play flip cup with you and your brothers. I think my Dad and brothers would absolutely love Hanging out with you. Aw! Good. Yeah, yeah. That makes me happy. She gets me already in the... the limited amount of time We spent together. We're going back to the cape. There's no doubt in my mind I get a hometown date. You and I have kind of established This connection with her. You've gotten closer to her than a lot of the other guys have, and so now we're kinda feeling the intensity here... (exhales deeply) Of watching her... Doing whatever she's doing with all these other guys, you know? After my group date with Ali, I'm feeling uneasy, Because I'm standing by and watching all these other guys Moving in on the girl that I care so much about. It's starting to kill me a little bit. Is she on top of him? What the hell is going on? Kirk : they're close. They're whispering. Why... why are we even watching this? I don't know. Hey, l-let's... Let's get in our own heads a little more. And it's almost getting to the point Where it's too much to... to handle, honestly. Hi. Hi. How... how are you, darling? I'm good. How are you? I... I'm okay. Justin proved a lot to me this week. He hiked all the way to my house, on crutches. That is huge, and that shows me he'll do so much for me as a husband. Okay, number one, I-I want you to know, That I had, like, an amazing time... Mm-hmm. When I kinda surprised you at your place and everything. But, uh, but, yeah, it's been a little bit, uh, challenging. Tell me about it. I had a particular individual yesterday, Kind of, you know, call me out, and been like, you know, "I still don't believe you're here for the right reasons" And so forth, and I'm just like, are you kidding me? I thought... I thought this was solved. And then it's funny, because... do you think it's 'cause of your wrestling thing? Well, I definitely think it was the wrestling thing At, you know, the first night... Mm-hmm. But I've said this before to you, like, you know, I... In a perfect world, I would NT to walk away From... from this experience with a wife and a best friend, Plain and simple. Like, I-I am here for you. I am 110% here for you. And it'd be great To have relationships inside the house, but that's not the reason why I'm here. I feel like the situation Between Vienna and all the girls and Jake is similar To Justin and all the guys and me. People think that Justin is sort of a little bit Of an ouast and different from everyone else. Just because I see that he is different than everyone else Doesn't mean that I don't think he's good for me. Steve : I feel like tonight I really need to step it up a notch. I missed out on any type of date this week. I've chosen to take the initiative and set up a nice little picnic in the front of the house and plan my own date for us. I need to get to know Ali better. I definitely need to have a sense of urgency, 'cause I've... I've kind of been falling behind. Oh, wow! I figured... Wow! If the date wasn't gonna come to me, I figured... I-I figured I had to bring the date to us. (gasps) this is awesome. So I figured this is the best way to do it. Yeah. I like that Steve brought me outside In front of the house tonight. That was so nice of him, and I really appreciate that. You can always win me over with a little champagne. (laughs) I figured that was the only way to do it at this point. All right. (speaks indistinctly) Absolutely no worries. Please don't... please don't point that at my head. That won't be... I was just making sure you're paying attention. (chuckles) That is just not coming off for you. No, it's... I got it. It's... it's just a little... My hand's a little fragile. What have you been doing here? All right, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it. I got it. Well, so... (laughing) as I try to attempt to open the champ... Give it. Let me see it. I got it. My hand's a little numb. This... this is Part of the... this is part of the entertainment That I provide. Yay! (cork pops) aah! I-I definitely feel like she was a little bit attracted by The fact that I wasn't, you know, I couldn't open it. Let's just be real. I mean, it took me a while to open it. Cheers to teaching me how to open a champagne bottle. I recovered quickly, and, um, Everything worked out for the best in the end, and that's the important thing. I'm going Into this rose ceremony feeling very confident. I will be shocked if I don't get rose. Ty : Justin's been playing games since he got here, I think. If you're one way with her and another way with us, That's just wrong. Be the same person and just be done with it. We see one thing. She sees something else. To me, Justin's two-faced. It's like Mr. Jekyll... And Hyde. I-I just don't get a... I don't get a sense he's being truthful. You know it wouldn't be as bad if it was just a couple people, but it's everybody. So... ors everybody wrong? John C. : no. I think it's true with anybody, That if you're gonna be one way with a set of guys and another way with somebody else, Sooner or later, it's gonna be... you're gonna be found out. So whether... it doesn't matter... I don't care who we're talking about. Could be any... anybody. Be the same person. Be true to your... you owe it to yourself. I'm sorry. I gotta butt in here. I'm just kinda curious. Who exactly are we talking about? We're talking about you. Man : I think you know. You're talking about me. Okay. So, okay. Man : he's been here for, like, five minutes. I just want to say one thing. So yeah... yeah, let's bring this all out on the table, 'cause this is getting... kinda getting ridiculous. I'm kinda getting pissed off about this. I don't normally swear, but this is getting (bleep) ridiculous. Whoever has anything to say to me, bring it. Say it. Vocalize it right now. This is my only question. The person that I see every day walking around this house Isn't the same person that she sees. Because what person you think she sees? I-I just don't... I d... I feel that there is something different About the person that is here with us and the person that is portrayed for her. I'm trying to bond on some type of level with you guys. I'm trying to figure it out, How... how can I, you know, befriend you guys? Ty : Justin's two-faced. He can have excuses all day long. I know what I live with. I know what I see. I... to be honest with you, my entire life, I've never experienced something like this. I'd like to ink that the connection I have with Ali is strong enough to overpower anything they have to say, but it's difficult. Like, imagine living With 12 other guys that all basically hate you. It's always been pretty, kind of easy for me to make friends, and all of a sudden, I come to this scenario, and it's like the biggest challenge of my life over here. Just because they think I'm a contender for Ali Doesn't mean that they all have to kind of team up on me. Ty : she's gonna gonna see through that here Before too long. She's got to. Karma's a bitch. It's gonna come back and get you. (Justin sighs) Here, this is how tough it is. If this is the kind of tension that has built and the kind of jealousy we're all feeling this early on, Think about all that we have ahead of us and all that she's going to share with these other guys. Are we going to be able to cope with that? Lately, it's been... it's been getting tougher to Watch these guys that I think might not be here for her... Like Justin, the wrestler. But even tougher than that is, I feel like as the group narrows down, Those roses mean more and more, so it makes me a little nervous. This whole deal is a test. It's a test of How much are you willing to go through for love? It's a test of mental toughness. How you doing? Hi. Ohh. (kisses) how you doing? Good. Oh, good. I'm in a good place with Ali, and I'm comfortable enough with her to let her know When I think something's off. I'm wanna kind of watch her back. And I feel like after the conversation with Justin, I need to say something. It's about Justin. I-I'm somebody who gives somebody, you know, The benefit of the doubt as long as I can, but... You know, ultimately... I just... I don't know what to do about that. Like, he... you know he came to my house. What's that? Do you know he came to my house, right? No. He came over? When was that? You don't know? No, I didn't know about that. I thought you guys knew. No, no. Nobody knows. I didn't know he came over there. Like... Like, walked up there. Mm-hmm. Really? Wait. On crutches? Yesterday. Mm-hmm. Really? I didn't realize that Justin hadn't told the guys That he came up to my house to see me, and I hope It doesn't make things worse for Justin in the house. That means a lot that he, like, did that. Like, I know it's really hard and... But then I hear all this stuff that he's doing these things. But he hasn't shown me that yet, you know? You do what's right for you. That's what this is all about. That's why you're here, right? She tells me that he walked over to her house, and I-I'm just like, that's just strange because I didn't know anything about it. I didn't hear anything about it. He didn't have a one-on-one date. It's not fair, and when I tell the guys... (bleep) gonna hit the fan for him. Justin, uh, walked over to her house yesterday In crutches. What? Yeah. I had no idea. Are you serious? How's it even possible? Yeah. I have no idea. I'm-a ask him. Let's go ask him. Yeah, let's gosk. Ty : let's go ask him. Come on. Kasey : where's he at? (Ty speaks indistinctly) yeah. No. I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I got... I got... we gotta interrupt just for a second. (speaks indistinctly) It's gonna blow your minds. You haven't heard about this yet. Better set it down. (laughs) What? Man : no, is this a real... no, this is real. No, we just got told... We just got told right now. Uh... I... absolutely. We just found out. Did you happen to walk over to Ali's house yesterday? I'm just curious because that's what we were just told. Who... who told you guys this? We're just asking a question. Is it yes or no? Uh, we're asking a question. Oh, man. Why don't you just crucify me right now? Um... We're not trying to crucify you. It's just a question. Yeah. Yes, I did. What happened? Hold... hold on. Hold on with this. (laughs) what? Uh, you know what? I felt that, you know, I kind of, be... because of the way I've been portrayed, That I really wanted to prove to her that I'm here 100% for her. And I felt that I needed that time alone with her. Well, everybody needs time with her. Hold on. Hold... let me... let me... wait. Whoa. Whoa. Chris Harrison came in earlier this week and said, You know, basically, take every opportunity you can To spend time with Ali. With everything else that... that's happened, I don't trust your intentions. I was just trying to say... (speaks indistinctly) so I-I didn't prove anything? But see, that's the thing. Like, I-I can't even try and prove anything to you guys... I-I can't imagine when ABC shows you trekking... 'cause I want Ali to know that I'm 100% here for her. Man : I know. I... And in order to prove that, like, I went ahead and I-I went all the w to her place. All right. Man : but a good guy at heart. I'll say it straight up. I think Justin is very creepy. I think he's all part of an act and he's just a, you know... I-I don't know what to expect anymore. It's all about attention, right? Not at all. Not... th... this is crazy. This is... Well, I mean, you lied to all of us. One minute, you don't care about us and one minute you do. Now you're trekking over on your crutches to Ali's house. I mean, like, come on. It's like, you know, it's funny 'cause everything that I do Kinda backfires. I'm a (bleep) detector. That's what I... what I do for a living. I detect (bleep). And the bottom line is, he doesn't care about Ali. It's all about gaining attention. The only person he cares about is himself. I've... I've... I've totally made up my mind on you, dude. Justin : all right. You're just not here for the right reasons. That's it. That's it. That's the last thing I gotta say. (sniffs) wow. (Craig) he's a joke. Like, I've never, ever experienced Something like this before, and it's... Like, this is the most... It's really challenge. Oh, hang on. (clears throat) Yesterday was, uh, the one-on-one date, um... With hunter. With hunter. Man : yeah. Ty : and he went over there in the afternoon... Before hunter left, obviously. Why do you think that Ali came so late? What do you think maybe the reason for that was? He took time away from hunter's date. Hunter deserved the right for his one-on-one. Lo and behold, the wrestler is up there. I-I just don't think it's fair. Where's Justin? Did he walk back up to her house So he could be there when she got home? (laughs) (sniffling) I'm upset, I'm angry, and that's why I didn't tell any of them, 'cause I knew they were gonna have this reaction and kind of... and just jump on top of me again. And... and to be honest with you, I think there's no winning over anybody in this house. In the wrestling world, you know, I play the villain. And apparently, now I'm playing the villain in real life, Which is really, really difficult for me and it's something that I'm... Have no other choice but to cope with and to deal with. Do y'all feel like Justin's gonna go home tonight Because of his actions? He's made it through two rose ceremonies. And the first one, people put his name in a box. You know, so, like... If good guys that are here for the right reason go and he stays, I'll be disappointed. I think tonight rated-r" stands for retired. I'm fairly confident right now That Justin's going home tonight... Which, to be quite honest with you, I'm glad about. (clinking) Men : hello. Chris Harrison : good evening. Hello, Chris. Fellas, how you doing? Ali? Sorry to break up the party, but time for another rose ceremony, if you would. Okay. ♪ Tonight is the first night That I feel like I'm on the chopping block, Definitely a concern of mine is, you know, uh, All this drama that's been going around, That it's gonna affect Ali's opinion of me, and I hope it's not. I was confident going into it, but there's a good chance I could be going home tonight. Gentlemen, good evening. Men : good evening. Pretty interesting night. Emotions are running high around here. I know things have gotten serious tween you and Ali. I promise you, it's only gonna get tougher from here on out. Kirk, Roberto, two of you have around received roses. Nothing to worry about tonight. As for the rest of you, nine roses to hand out. Two of you will be going home tonight. I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, and if you're ready, here's Ali. Hi, Chris. Thank you. You know, tonight is easier and harder for me All at the same time. I feel like I'm really building connections With a lot of you. And also, I know there's been some tension in the house. And I get it. I've been there. But all I can do is thank you for being here, Thank you for putting your life on hold and being patient with me. ♪ Chris l. (giggles) Would you accept this rose? Yeah, you know it. (giggles) great. Jesse. Just couldn't resist you in this Jean get-up. (laughs) (chuckles) Chris n. Chris, will you accept this rose? Yes. ♪ Ty. Do you accept this rose? Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. ♪ Kasey. Kasey, will you accept this rose? Yes, I will. Thank you. Mm-hmm. All right. Craig. Craig, will you accept this rose? Of course I will. Frank. Will you accept this rose? Yes. Absolutely. ♪ Thank you. Jonathan. (exhales deeply) (laughs) (squeals) My blood pressure's, like, whew. Okay, so will you accept this rose? (laughs) absolutely. Ali, gentlemen... The final rose tonight. When you're ready. ♪ Justin. (exhales deeply) (whispering) thank you for showing me That you would do anything for this. Mm-hmm. Ab... honestly, absolutely. Will you accept this rose? I'd propose to accept that rose from you. Thank you. (whispers) thank you. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. If you did not receive a rose, Take a moment. Say your good-byes. (speaks indistinctly) Best of luck. Thank you. Wish you well. Thank you. (whispers) take care. I-I came out here To have a lifelong, lasting relationship with Ali, and now I'm kinda left in the dust. Obviously, she didn't feel Any type of... Connection, and I fell short. I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Thank you. Thank you. Wish we had more time. (speaks indistinctly) Thank you. Best of luck. Okay. Okay. I'm pissed th I'm leaving tonight. I shouldn't be going, I don't think. I think she made a mistake. And I think Justin's here for the wrong reasons. To know that he's still here and I'm going home, It's not right. I-don't understand it, you know? I don't know if Justin's real. I don't know if he's being genuine or not. I don't think anyone does. So I hope to God that Ali realizes that sooner than later. You know, I'm a genuine guy. I've got so much to give, you know? I mean, it's... It's just a shame that... that Ali couldn't see that. I truly believe that she could've fallen in love with me. And it just sucks that we're never gonna know. That was hard. But the good part about these nights is the end, Where we can celebrate The exciting things that we have ahead. And I have some really great surprises this week... Good. That I'm really thrilled about, so, um, Thank you for being here and bearing with me and your patience, and I'm excited for what lies ahead. So cheers to all of us. Men : cheers. All right.

Ali : I am shaking like crazy. There is no turning back. (sings indistinctly) Man : all of a sudden, He shows up and he's got this bandage on his wrist. What happened to you? Oh, man. I'm injury-prone, apparently. This guy's full of (bleep) he said he was in the hospital. Well, guess what. I'm gonna call him out on that. Ooh. This should be fun. Aah! (laughs) aah! Man : he's totally obsessed with her, and he's gonna freak her out. How do you know if that person's right for you? It's just my heart. Jump in.
