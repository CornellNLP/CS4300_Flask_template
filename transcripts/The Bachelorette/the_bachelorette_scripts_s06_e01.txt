 Last season on " the bachelor"... 
 So nice to finally meet you. You're so handsome. It's nice to meet you. Well, thank you. 
 Ali fell head over heels in love with Jake. 
 Ali, will you accept this rose? 
 Yes. I'm so happy. Oh, my gosh. 
 I have goosebumps. 
 (laughs) (squeals) 
 All right. You ready? 
 So ready. Whoo! 
 It's almost like a fairy tale. 
 I feel comfortable with you. 
 Me, too. Aah! 
 And to viewers across America, It looked like Ali had found her prince charming. 
 You are everything that I've ever dreamt That I would find in somebody. I want to be there in the end. If you asked me today, I would say yes." But then their love came to a shocking end. (crying) What's the matter? I have, like, the most impossible decision To make right now. I have to choose between staying here and going back to work. Ali was forced to choose Between her dream job and the love of her life. Ali : I came into this With everything I wanted in life except for you. I don't want you to go. (whispers) I have to go. (crying) I don't know if I made the right choice. (sobs) what--what did I do? ? Ali : I definitely have had a lot of regrets. Looking back, I was so wrong. I think that the biggest mistake I made that night Was choosing a desk and computer and keyboard Over someone who could be the love of my life. It's been very difficult for me To put love and relationships first. I let my insecurities and fear dictate my life, and I'm not gonna be a victim to that anymore. I'm really ready. I'm ready to move forward, and I'm ready to meet someone and put them first above all things. And now Ali's going to get a second chance at love... As the new bachelorette. Chris : please welcome the next bachelorette... (laughs) Ali! (cheering) there she is! Oh! I'm so grateful to be the bachelorette. Chris : Ali! Ali : I think everyone deserves a second chance. I'm not gonna let fear hold me back this time. I'm gonna find that guy... Love it! Whew! And I'm back and I'm ready to find love. I don't know how they found 25 guys that wanted to date me. (laughs) 'cause I've tried my whole life. Bring on those boys. I'm really excited. I came on the bachelor" to find love, and I found it and then let it go, and I'm not gonna let that happen again. I'm ready to open up and get that guy that I should've had before. I'm gonna be strong and just not let everything in my whole life That I've let scare me hold me back. I know in the end it's all gonna be worth it. I can only imagine how much more I'm gonna grow and how much of a better person I'm gonna be For this experience. I know this was my sign. I'm ready for anything. I've quit my job. I've moved out of my apartment. I wanna leave no regrets that I put everything I had into it. I know it's gonna be hard. I know it's gonna test me in unimaginable ways. But, you know, if I meet my husband here, I would be so grateful. ? I've reprioritized my life, but I'm still that girl that's gonna throw on a pair of jeans and just kick a soccer ball around. That's who I am at heart, and that's who I'm ways going to be. I'm never gonna give up that life can't be As great and wonderful as I think it can be. I'm hopeful that there's a better life to be had. Am I scared to death that I quit my job? Yes. (chuckles) I know, more than anything going into this, That there is chance I won't meet someone. My biggest fear is not one of those guys will be right for me. But my life can exist with a great man. I'm determined to get that again, and I think I can as long as I just move forward With an open mind and an open heart. ? At the end of this, I'm hoping I am standing in some amazing place, Tears in my eyes, and I'm looking at a man down on one knee Asking me to be his wife. That would be pretty amazing. (laughs) God, I'd better have some waterproof mascara on that day. (laughs) Aah! (squeals) And tonight... Hi! America's most eligible bachelors Are here to meet Ali. Aah! (laughs) Whoo! Ali : I'm so shocked at how many great guys are here. Cheers! Whoo! (men) cheers! If you're not laughing, I will do it. I'm a reservoir of energy. I don't know about this cat. You are a brave man for telling that story. And it's a party like you've never seen before. (laughs) I'm kind of known as... (laughing) "rated-r." rated-r. If I hear you say something to me That says you' promoting yourself Or you're--you're not here for the right reasons, Then I'm not with you. I just want you to be careful. (Ali) I'm afraid that I'm gonna Keep someone around that's gonna break my heart in the end. Gentlemen, write down the name or names of a guy  That you feel is not here for the right reason. Man : somebody is going home tonight because of this. And then... Ali : go! Whoo! (man) you get this many guys in one place, Something's gonna happen. Your personality, man. You're a good-looking guy, but you--that's all you got. This guy is crazy. He's just asking to be laid out. Why are you so upset? Don't (bleep) talk to me. Someone said I was dangerous. Take some accountability for your actions, dude. I told you straight up I don't like you. There's nothing good that can come out of him being here. He was potentially gonna do something big. (Ali) I came here to find a husband, and you're (bleep) with that. Man : karma is a bitch. Ohh! I gave up my job. I gave up my apartment. I gave up everything to be here. Man : it's gonna come back and get ya. Are you serious? Ali : it's unspeakable, what you've done. (man) (bleep). Chill out! Ali : you're seriously gonna walk away from me? You're gonna out like this? This is how you want to be perceived? I can't put my heart out there again to be broken. (cheering) Man : we are going around the world To fall in love with Ali. Ali : whoa! Man : I am absolutely certain that I can Make Ali a happy woman for the rest of her life. (laughs) Man : I know this was the girl I want to spend my life with. I am in love with Ali. Ali : I know it's gonna be hard, but, you know, you have to kind of go through the fire To get to the happily ever after. It all starts right now On the exciting season premiere of the bachelorette." Hi. I'm Chris Harrison, and welcome To the exciting new season of the bachelorette." Millions of viewers watched As Ali met Jake on the bachelor" And fell deeply in love. I think everyone, including Ali, Thought she had found the man of her dreams. But their relationship came to a shocking end When Ali was forced to choose Between her dream job and her relationship with Jake. She chose her job and has regretted that decision ever since. But now Ali is choosing love, and she's ready to be our new bachelorette. Ali's on her way here right now, but before we welcome her back, Let's take a look at the 25 bachelors Who have come from all over America to meet her. ? I love Chicago! I lived in the city, had a great job, Awesome little condo along the Chicago River. Gave it all up to follow my dreams, and I'm still chasing my dreams. My name is Frank. I'm 30 years old, from Chicago, Illinois. I used to be a mergers and acquisitions consultant Working for a billion-dollar, multinational firm. Just wasn't fulfilled. It wasn't making me happy. Sir, I used to work in this building. You? Can you imagine me in that building? Now I'm actually an aspiring screenwriter. 'tis but a dream. So I moved back me, with my parents, writing scripts. Passion is so much more important than money, and definitely need that in a girl, and it's hard to find. Man : by the way... Yeah? The new bachelorette is Ali. The bachelorette is Ali? No (bleep)? Oh, my God! (laughs) You swear to God? (slaps leg) here we go. I am beyond excited. ? Whoo! I love you, Ali. It's all for you, babe. I'm gonna win her heart. I am. Some high knees. She's gonna fall in love with me. I'm gonna fall in love with her. We're getting married. (laughs) that's what's gonna happen. My name's Jay. I'm 29 years old, and I'm from Barrington, Rhode island. I'm a lawyer. I work in my Dad's law firm, and my brother is an attorney as well, So we all work there together in personal injury law. Is this piece of evidence A fair and accurate description of the accident scene? The family that sues together stays together... (laughs) As long as you don't Sue each other. I'm super, super stoked about meeting Ali. And what Ali did, leaving the show for work, I think that's amazing that she's that into her career and that's that important to her, Because that's really that important to me as well. Ali--she has, like, that drive, that fresh outlook on life... Coupled with her being gorgeous. You know, that doesn't hurt. ? (water running) Eyebrows, hair... Oh, yeah. I'm Craig, 33, and I live downtown Toronto. Oh, yeah. This is gonna work. I've done the single life for probably the last five years. (whistles) watch out, Toronto. When I go out and I hit the clubs... Whoo! I mean, it's a club, right? She does. I'm definitely good with the girls. It always goes over well. I love the single life, but I'm-- I'm willing to give all that up for Ali and I to fall in love. If I had that really good feeling of falling in love, I'd be on one knee in a second. ? My name's Kyle. I'm 26. I'm from Colorado. I am a mountain man. Through and through, I am a mountain man. It's lonely out here. There's a bunch of deer, There's a bunch of mountains, there's a bunch of trees, and, uh, there's no women. No women at all. (engine whirring) I need a woman. I have a better relationship with the outdoors and the fish and the animals than I do women out in Colorado, So I need somebody around. I need someone to be next to me. I need someone to go ice fishing with. So what I need is Ali. I've been hunting since I was born. I got my first gun when I was 4 years old. I think this is actually the first buck I ever shot. I've killed ducks, geese, Turkey, Quail, pheasant, dove and elk, rattlesnakes. I've killed antelope. I've killed bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions. Hey, I think I'm gonna bring somebody home To take care the both of us. Her name's Ali. I'm definitely not afraid of the other 25 guys. I mean, I've killed a bear. Oh! Uhh! This is a message to all you other bachelors out there-- Be scared. Be very scared. Once I get that first impression rose, I will win. Did you have enough? Did you have enough? I don't think so. (thud) Because I am-- I am Mr. "rated-r." (grunts) My name is Justin. I am a professional wrestler. ? The villain I play in the ring is rated-r," And he's kind of the complete opposite Of what I am in reality. Oh! What happened? Did you get hurt? (kisses) mm. It's not a joke. While doing moves in the ring, I landed on--on my foot, and--and it broke. So, yeah, broken ankle. Woman : oh! Not the other one. I was raised by my mom and my grandmother. I am a grandma's boy. (chuckles) I'll admit--totally admit that. You know, I love my grandmother to death. She is--honestly, she's, like, the world to me. (speaks Portuguese) My grandmother wants me to- -to get married and settle down really badly. Ali's definitely the type of girl That I can see myself marrying. (speaks Portuguese) I'm really ready to bring home Ali. I'm gonna fight very hard for her. I'm not gonna let these guys walk all over me. Mwah! My name is Phillip, 30 years old and live in Chicago. I'm an investment manager, but work was definitely on the back burner in 2009. My brother Michael, who was 22 years old-- He passed away, and it was a pretty big shock. After that, my whole life changed. I've reshifted my priorities To--to focus more on family and friends and doing things that I really, really care about. The training for triathlons Was the biggest part of my healing process. It was a way for me to reflect On what do I want for the rest of my life. And one big thing That's missing in my life is, uh, is that woman. Six months ago, there's no way I could do this. And as time has gone on, I've realized that I am ready, and I'm doing this for the absolutely right reason, and that's because I wanna fall in love, and I'm ready for it. ? All right, everybody. Big area low pressure right now, Moving through southeast Texas. Probably see about a half inch, maybe an inch total. I am Jonathan. I am from Houston, Texas, and I'm 30 years old. I'm a weatherman. (whimsical music playing) (blows) My secret weapon that I have, that the other guys don't have, Is probably my humor. Juggling. I'm juggling. I am geared up to meet Ali. I'm totally ready. "I heart u." what? I'll use my humor. If she laughs, I'll--I'll use it. If she doesn't laugh, I'll stop, I guess. Look at that. Very weird. No rain with this system, but roses. Yeah. I have no idea how this is possible. (clippers buzzing) I'm coming to L.A. To meet Ali, and I am ready to see if love is there. I like a good pink shirt. It brings out my eyes. I'm ready to fall in love. That's what I'm hoping for. ? Come on. Yeah. My name is Ty. I'm from Franklin, Tennessee. I'm 31 years old. Shake. Good boy. That's a good boy. I've got a dog named pax. We do everything together. And, uh, I love him to death. I'm gonna go away for a while. Yeah. Maybe find you a new mama. You know, I want to be married. I want to have a family. Kids are definitely, you know, One of the top priorities for me. I was married for about two years, and I only got divorced a few months back. You know, things just did not work out The way that we thought they should, and we felt that it was needed to go our separate ways. You know, I don't regret being divorced at all. I learned so much, not only about relationships, but about myself, and I'm ready, you know, try to move on with my life and, uh, ready for the next step. I think Ali and I would definitely get along, Absolutely. I definitely want to make enough of an impression That she keeps me around for a lile while to, uh, See what'll happen. ? (seagull cries) My name is Chris. I'm 32. I'm from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. I was a High School math teacher for many years. And I moved to New York, and I ended up living there For five years, uh, teaching New York City public school. My mom was ill, so the decision to leave New York and move back to the cape was a no-brainer. My mom meant so much to me That it was really difficult to be that far away. If I didn't come home to be with my mom For the last year and a half of her life, I would have been kicking myself for the rest of my life. Family is number one. I can get a job anywhere doing anything. I'm not worried about that. But, you know, family-- I could never get another mom. Come on! Since she passed away, I know now that life is so fleeting, so short. Love is the only reality. It's simple, right? I need that perfect soul mate. That's the one void in my life right now. And, hopefully, that void will be filled by Ali. ? Tonight's the night. I'm excited to meet Ali. Ali's beautiful. (laughs) Man : Ali is definitely a 10. She has all the intangibles that I would look for in someone-- Humor being one of the biggest things. You're amazing. It's a big night. I'm excited. But, uh, I can't lie. I'm a little nervous. I've never had this much anticipation for something, Ever, I don't think. I'm not worried about the competition. In my mind, I already got it. (frank) I'll do anything for Ali. That's why I'm here. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to see that That happens. (Justin) I'm gonna fight as hard as possible to win Ali's heart. Now I may have to break another ankle, but it'd be worth it. Definitely, definitely, it would be worth it. All right, here we go! Frank : Whoo! (man) let's do it! I think I've got a great shot with Ali. You know, if someone Gets in my way, look out, 'cause I'm gonna come after yo (all) to Ali. John C. : cheers. If you'd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor" or the bachelorette," Go to bachelor.ABC. Com and click apply." Man : yeah! I'm extremely happy that things did not work out With Ali and Jake. I wouldn't be here if it was anybody else. She was my favorite, far and away. I was psyched when she left, Because she was the only one I wanted. And when she was crying in Te She just needed a hug. Jake-- like, he didn't do anything, and I was, like, "you moron. " cheers to Jake. Cheers to Jake. Way to go, Jake. Thank you, Jake, for screwing up. (laughs) Man : so, fellas, to an incredible night, to Ali. (man) cheers to that. Men : to Ali. Man : to Ali! (man) Whoo! 25 eligible bachelors have left their families, their friends and, yes, their jobs, to come here and meet Ali. And if all goes well, one of them will become her husband. The guys are on their way, but before they arrive, Let's welcome back America's newest sweetheart-- Our bachelorette, Ali. Chris! How are you? Good to see you again. Good to see you. Welcome back. Thank you so much. I'm so excited to be back. You feeling good about this? I'm feeling great. Yeah, really nervous. Glad to be here, though? Yes. All right. Well, we have a lot to talk about. The guys are on their way. Before they get here, Let's go in and have a chat. Okay. Sounds great. Come on. Have a seat. Thank you. Welcome back. Thanks. It's good to be back. Can you believe you're here? Can you believe you're actually doing this? Absolutely not. It's amazing. I feel so lucky. You're ready to come back here, take that next big step? You're ready to find love? I'm so ready to just... Be in love again and- -and have a-a life, Have a guy to come home to and kiss every day and tell him I love him. I'm so ready for that. And I'm excited. When I came to meet Jake, I-I definitely believed There was a chance at finding something, but I didn't know. I didn't know the experience. I didn't know what it was gonna be like. Right. It was all completely unknown. Now I know. I know this works. You fell in love on this show. Mm-hmm. I mean, it did work for you. Yeah. But then you were faced with this... Incredibly tough decision... (sighs) Your job or this relationship with Jake-- And you chose your job. I should've known better at the time and I should've known you go with your heart. And I don't wanna ever make that mistake again. I know a life without love is a life without happiness, and I wanna be happy. And honestly, the thing that's so great about this for me is... Yeah? I-I-I gave up my job, I moved out of my apartment. It is all on the line. I-I've given up everything, and there's something so scary about that but there's something so just... Awesome about that. Yeah. It just makes me feel free and-- and invigorated, and I feel like I could just do anything I want. What do you fear most about this whole thing? I gave up so much to be here, and I'm very scared That someone will let the idea that this is a game to be won Gein the way Of whether or not they really have feelings for me. That's the most terrifying thing. You bring up an interesting point. You know, are they here for the right reasons? I mean, I really don't know how I'm gonna figure that out. I just hope I feel it. I just hope it's there. And I'm gonna ask all the guys here tonight To just be really open and honest with me. And I-I hope that I'm smart enough To distinguish the difference when someone's being-- Telling me things out of jealousy and telling me things, you know, and being very sincere about it. If everything goes perfectly, where are you... Five years down the road? Ten years down the road? (whispers) God. (normal voice) I want a life filled with love and an amazing husband, and I hope I'm pregnant. (laughs) that sounds so weird! But, like-- you want kids? I want kids! I want children. Okay. I am a hu--I love kids. I mean, it just--it's so, you know, for me to say that and I haven't met my husband yet, it just--it's-- It doesn't mean you don't know what you want. Right, right. It's just--it's unreal. Well, Al I'm about to make this very real for you... (laughs) Right now. Good. 25 anxious gentlemen are in limousines right now. They're about to pull in your driveway.

So what are you looking for? I mean, obviously you want, Like, an honest guy. (Ali) I'm looking for somebody who is smart and funny and wants to treat me right. Ali is looking super fly. I mean, it sounds cheesy, but she just took my breath away. I want to get to know everyone and make sure I'm making The right choices tonight, and it's hard in this amount of time. Even though I just met Ali right now, I think I'm in a little bit of puppy love. She's absolutely a complete sweetheart. What kind of girl are you looking for? Great sense of humor definitely is the most important thing, I think. Ali just blew me away. This girl is breathtaking. She is stunning. She is everything I've ever wanted. And there's a lot of competition in there, So I need to pull her aside, and I need another hug. I need it. Look, Ali... (speaks indistinctly) sure. These are lovely gentlemen. Man : see you, Ali. Sorry to take you away. Oh, that's fine. You gotta be bold in these situations. Yeah? Yeah. Somebody just go steal her? Yeah, Frank's out there. Yeah, Frank's out there right now. Just gonna see what happens. Well, tell me about yourself. I'm a huge risk taker. I follow my heart, everything I do. Mm-hmm. I was living this great life. I was a consultant living in Chicago. Mm-hmm. Didn't love it. I quit that job. I moved to Paris. Wow. And I was living in Paris for a while writing screenplays. That's amazing. And I see that in you. You're flowing your heart. You're doing what you feel is right... Mm-hmm. And that takes a lot of courage to do that... Yeah. And that's attractive. I love that about you. Thank you. I love that about you. I mean, Paris? That's amazing. Yeah. I've never been. You haven't? No. Well, we'll have to go. (laughs) you're a funny guy. I like that. So-- Mm. You're gorgeous! Oh, thank you. Oh, my God. I actually made--I made a scrapbook for her. (man) really? I made a scrapbook of all the things that are important To me and that I want to share with her. Like, I-I macramé--I like, used, like, a glue stick-- (man) you said mramé? That's impressive. I spent, like, eight hours on that thing. Wow. I went to a scrapbook store. Wow! Hey, if I was a girl, and somebody made a scrapbook For me, I think that'd be just weird. (grunts) nothing wrong with sticking your neck out there. What do you have to lose? Nothing. I got made fun of a little bit, but I don't care what- what anybody else thinks. I went truthfully out on a limb for this girl, and I really hope it pays off. I actually made something for you. Oh! I really did. So, uh, it's right here. I was hoping maybe you could take a look at it. Yes, I'd love to. I can't wait. Is that okay? Yeah. All right. Here you go. Very cute. Gone fiin'. Yes. I love fishing. Do you really? I swear. I used to go fishing with my Dad. I love it. "be ridiculous." I just think it's important to act like an idiot sometimes. This picture is great. Don't you? Exactly. Uh, that's my mom, my gorgeous mother. Oh, w. She's beautiful. "of course, Family is very important." it is. You're actually reading this stuff. My God. Yeah. It is impressive. I feel really good. I really think she liked the scrapbook. And the other guys--they can make fun of me all they want. Who's gonna be laughing when I get a rose and they go home? (sing song) hi! Hello there. Ali is everything I've ever wanted in a woman. I've had my trials and tribulations. I've been through a lot, and you know, I've kind of waited For the right time, the right place, the right opportunity. And here I am. I know that in the end I'll be there on one knee. I'll be the last man standing. I'll be Ali's future husband. More than anything, I just want to be the guy that's gonna guard and protect your heart, and I'll be here For that no matter what happens. Thank you. You're amazing. Your mama raised you well. No, no, no. Just... (chuckles) where are you from? Tell me about your family. You know what? No, I'm a mama's boy. I'm straight mama's boy. Like, my mom is like-- my family is everything to me. Mm-hmm. My parents got divorced when I was around 12 years old. Me, too. 12 years old, my family. You're kidding. Mm-hmm, yeah. Wow. Yeah, we have that in common. Dad actually cheated on my mom. Oh, wow. And it was kind of difficult to kind of take in, and from that moment on, I told myself I would never, ever Make another woman hurt like that, ever, For as long as I live. Wow. You are blowing me away right now. I think the fact that- -that something really difficult Happened in your life like that, and you Te it and just make so much positive out of it... You have to. And let it change you for the better, I-I think that's amazing. You know, opening the doors, grabbing glasses of wine, Like, you know, just little things like that... Yeah. That's just who I am, and I think a lot of guys Have taken that for granted. This is me. This is who I am. I know it's a little corny and cheesy, but-- no, I don't think it's corny. I love it. I love that kind of chivalry, and I think it's really sweet, and I like it that you're like that. And, um-- You're so cute. (laughs) you're making me blush now. You're making me turn bright red. Come on. I am so shocked at how many great guys are here. They're interesting and smart and funny. So far, they've been better an I could ever imagine, So hopefully it stays that way. Ali : oh, what is this? Playing the ol' uke. You want to sit down? Yes, I do. Competition is good. I mean, there's 24 other guys here. So I gotta make myself stand out. I'm gonna make a little bit of an ass out of myself, but hopefully it'll make her giggle as well. ♪ my name is hunter, and I'm 28 ♪

(man laughs) Scrapbooks, we got backflips... You did, like, cirque Du soleil. There's 25 of us here, all fighting for her attention, So you gotta stand out somehow. (derrick) stiff competition. My strategy to get a rose tonight is to be myself, but I need to kind of be aggressive. I'm gonna tell her why I'm called shooter," And I hope it's not too early. So I came in and said, "shooter" as- -as my name... Yes, shooter, shooter. So I have to explain it. Yeah. (laughs) Kind of an embarrassing story. Oh, go for it. I love that. I might have, like, prematurely... In college, freshman year, accidentally... (laughs) accidentally what? And so then that's maybe how... Oh! (laughs) That m-maybe...

Thank you. That's very sweet. You--you've said a few things that have really struck me, Like, honesty is a huge thing, and then someone who's independent, Who's goal-oriented, career-oriented... Mm-hmm. That's--that's great. The weatherman didn't let me get a word in. He's like... (imitates motor rumbling) And I'm like-- I couldn't say anything. So, hey, anyways, tell me about your experience tonight. It must've been... Were you kind of eased into the--the whole thing? I'm having such a good time. (laughs) yeah, me, too. You seem like a real per-- To be honest with you, I didn't watch the show on purpose. Mm-hmm. Jonathan : I wanted to be Nat--to be natural. (man) hey, what's up? (laughs) stealing me away? Thank you guys so much. (Jonathan) thank you. Absolutely. Nice meeting you. Absolutely. Thank you. I don't think Ali could say anything. I couldn't Say anything, so... I think he shot himself in the foot. How'd it go? Craig M. : it went pretty good. I was with the weatherman. You always gotta let her, uh, respond to what you're saying. Yes. Craig M. : you can't just go... (makes rapid gunfire sounds) Give her some time to speak, all right? Craig m.--Hair guy... (laughs) was kind of patronizing me A little bit, and I didn't really appreciate it. How's the night going for you guys? Really good, but we haven't had enough of you. Good evening. (man) hello. ...And I'm like, oh, my God. I'm gonna have a heart attack. Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt, Ali. The rose we talked about earlier. You know what to do, So just hand that out when you're ready. See ya in a bit. Oh, man. I think my heart just, like, skipped a beat. (laughs) it's very-- It's like, all of a sudden, it just got so serious. It's very intimidating. Just put something over it. Man : it's--it's--it's-- how different is it sitting in this place as it was When you were sitting in? There's no similarities. (laughs) I mean, like... I mean, except that I was looking for love in both places. I hate to interrupt. Can I get me one-on-one time? Let's go. No. Of course. (laughs) Man : wow. Go for the kill. When Chris walked out with the rose, That was kinda the moment I knew I had to kinda step it up. Dun-dun-dun-dun! Roberto--he was smart. He, uh, all of sudden-- "hey, can I have my one-on-one time?" It was like a--like a boom! " he took the opportunity. I mean, that's--that's the name of the game. When--when you look at that, It makes everything a lot more real. That's scary right there, because-- Why is it scary? Because ten of us aren't getting one of those. Man : may the best man win, right? If you'd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor" or the bachelorette," Go to bachelor.ABC. Com and click apply." Man : the rose is out there right now, and I'll be honest. I'm feeling a little bit of the pressure, definitely. Pressure's on, for sure. I think... I-I-I just want you GU to kind of-- Wait, wait. Hang on. Look at this for a second, 'cause this is what you're gonna be seeing later on tonight. When the first impression rose was put on the table Right in front of us, it really kinda made you realize That, you know, this isn't a game. If you really wanna be with her, you gotta-- You gotta get one of those roses, so, yeah, it's real now. (man) so where is Ali? You look handsome. I know! I look handsome. That's--that's a good thing. I'm glad you think that. I was--I wasn't sure. I wanna know all about you. I wanna know all about you, but I'll tell you about me. (laughs) okay. I'm an open book. (laughs) I grew up in Tampa, Florida. Mm-hmm. Come from an awesome family. My mom and Dad are just amazingly happily married, So that's kinda like my model for how, like, I want a relationship and that type of thing. Mm-hmm. But, um, moved to Charleston about two months ago. Nice. Opening my own business. That's exciting. I took some time out to do this. So, uh, yeah. Mm-hmm. I'm so glad you did. Um, it's--it's exciting. What do you--I guess kind of a-an open-ended question, but what do you want out of life? Like, at the end of the day, when it's all said and done? I want to... Have a family Who I feel fills me up with unconditional love. I agree, big-time. That's--that's--you-- mm-hmm. Love makes everything worth it I was raised in a family with so much love. My mom and Dad are-- They still have that, you know, that kind of love. Yeah. So... You look so beautiful. Your... (laughs) oh, my gosh. Don't say that. You're making me blush! (laughs) Your eyes. I'm just like, wow. Roberto : being with Ali feels really natural. Feel a connection with her. Um, hopefully she feels a connection with me. I told her when I got out of the limo, I wanted to salsa dance with her, so I hope She gives me the chance to show her a couple moves, and I'd like to get the first impression rose. Okay. We're good. Are you ready? It's all in the hips. Okay. So are you ready? It's all about-- Oh, wow. You're good. Nice. All right. (laughs) I'm gonna spin you on the way back. Are you ready? Oh, my gosh. I'm really nervous. Here we go. Oh, look at that! You're a pro. (laughs) okay. I'm trying. High five. Awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome. Oh, thank you. That was so fun. Really good. Really good. I am really, really digging Roberto. He is sexy. He's sweet. I would've liked to dance a little more, but there's still some guys I really need to talk to. Here. I know it's cold. Aw, thank you. But you used to be from new England, So you should be used to this kind of weather. Oh, I am totally a California girl now. (laughs) You are? There you are. Yeah. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Ohh! How is everything going? Not too bad. I was a little nervous, but, yeah, Actually, um--it's actually pretty good so far. Um... Yeah? Ye. You look wicked awesome tonight. Wicked awesome. Aw, thank you. You're wicked hot. Wicked hot guy. (laughs) Tell me more about Cape Cod. What--what do you do there? What do you... Um, I got a nice little house right--right by the beach. We can go hang out. Dogs. Play a little Frisbee. What kind of dogs? Black lab. (gasps) I love labs. Living with my Dad right now, and, uh, my brothers live right down the street... Mm-hmm. And it's kinda fun. Do you have close family? Very close. Yeah, yeah. My brothers are really cool people. Um... So just brothers? Yep. Just three brothers. Well, m-myself, so two brothers and myself. So who teach--who aches you how to treat the women? My mom. She was-- oh, duh! (laughs) Come on, now. We're all mama's boys. You're all mama's boys. All mama's boys. I'll do whatever for my mom, so... Yeah. Well, good, then hopefully you'll kind of push Some of that energy off to your woman. Oh, definitely. Definitely. If I treated a woman bad, my mom would kill me. And your parents are still together? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's awesome. Ali asked me if my parents were still together, and I kinda just glazed over a little bit and said, Yeah, they were. My mother passed away about a year and a half ago, and, obviously, talking about my mom and my family is something that- it's really important to me. It's dear to me, and I didn't want to bring that up yet. That's not a first impression thing. I just wanted her to see, Like, a general idea of my personality first, and hopefully that glimpse was enough to, uh, get me a rose. Is that it? Is that the rose? That's it. That's the first impression rose. That's the first impression rose. I'm thinking about eating it. If I eat it, I can take it into my soul forever, and nobody else can have it. Yeah? (laughs) Kyle : Getting that first rose would be such a huge relief. If you're a true hunter, you hike to the highest peak, Through any River, through any mountain, Through the highest grasses, to find what you want. I would do that for Ali. I'm, uh, I'm from Denver, Colorado. Uh-huh. I spend, like, probably 90% of my time outdoors, and one of my good friends gave me a hat, and, uh, my Dad ended up giving me a good luck charm To go on my ha so every time I'm outdoors, I have this good--like, this good luck hat. Oh. And, uh, I got you something. Oh! Man : that's really cool. That's exactly what I wear on my hat. Oh, that's so cool! It's always- -it's always brought me good luck. I just--I--I really-- wow! Thank you! I hope it brings me some good luck. I love to fish, too. I-I-I love it. Do you? Jay : I just totally dropped the ball. I had one chance, and I totally blew it. I would not say that I'd be getting a rose tonight, Just on the first impression I left her. I mean, I have a lot of ground to make up. I got a lot of work to do. Ali : hi, guys. Hi. How's it going? (man) hi. How are you? Good. I'm gonna grab you. Let's hop outside. (laughs) oh, jeez. Okay. Here we go. Shall we go? Ready? Yeah, let's go. After you. Oh, well, thank you. (laughs) Jonathan : the sympathy card's like an x" factor. You just... Mm! You can't go wrong with a broken leg. I mean, I was actually thinking, Maybe I should go break my arm and come back. It probably would--would help. Absolutely- tell me about your foot. Yeah. So I injured it a little bit, and, um, one thing that you should know about me is that, um, I do a little bit of professional wrestling. Really? (laughs) And--yeah. So I was wrestling, and, uh, it actually bent sideways... Ohh. And that- -and I broke my ankle. When did this happen? Like, two weeks ago. Oh, man. So yeah. So it just, just happened, and, uh-- (laughs) oh, no. Yeah, and, you know, in--in the wrestling world, The one thing-- I think you should, like, maybe see one of my t-shirts. I'm kind of known as... (laughs) As a little bit of a... "rated-r." (laughs) "rated-r." Uh, but, yeah, but when I get in the wrestling ring... (deep voice) I do things the rated-r" way. So, you know, you might talk With a little bit more bass in your voice. (laughs) And one thing I want you to know is that, Ali, I am absolutely here for the right reasons... (laughs) Not like any of these other- 24 other jabronis Sitting in that house right there. I don't know about this cat. But I will definitely break some bones for you... (laughs) (laughs) (normal voice) if any of them get out of hand. Man : hey. Sorry, man. Yeah. (laughs) and this is the worst possible timing you could come into this. Y-y-you wanna come--yeah. We're having some good one-on-one time. I might have to get a little bit rated-r" on you, brother. (laughs) Yeah. (laughs) you know? Where I come from, We call that rated bad"... (laughs) not rated-r." (man) yeah yeah, that's... Are you g--you're... Good. Okay. Perfect. Oh, no. I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry. I got it. All right. How you doing? Yeah? Sorry my hands are cold. Good. How are you? I haven't seen you in a while. Ali : oh, no worries. (man) come on, speedy. Sit down. (laughs) Man : hey, how'd it go? (man) it w-- it went, uh... Man : what was the rated-r" thing? I didn't--I-- (man laughs) Man : dude, I saw the rated-r" thing. I was gonna do the superman thing, but... Man : oh, man. Yeah, I see it. You know what? I had to come clean, you know. Justin : I'm a professional wrestler. Whoa. Yeah, wait. What? Uh, yeah, no, I do entertainment wrestling. I beat people up for a living. Wait, wait, wait. Can I call a time-out real quick? Absolutely. Is this--are we talking about fake wrestling? Entertainment wrestling. Man : like that... "get over here!" man : "get over here!" (laughs) Justin : whoa. Okay. So what, is this all tag team up on me? What do you think's so funny? Did you get-- did you put her in a headlock and throw her in the pool at all? Little bit surprised that my fellow Canadian Craig Kind of, like, jumped on me like that, but that just kinda shows his character, and y-you know, all I was doing was just defending myself. I think Craig's actually here maybe to get more hair products. It's like, I was worried about the Americans out here. I gotta worry about the Canadians, too. Jeez. (man) yeah. You better sleep with your eyes open. (laughs) Listen, if you're here for the same reason I'm here for, Then I'm fine with you, but, I mean, if I hear you Say something to me that says you're promoting yourself, Then... I'm not with you. (Craig r. ) Justin-- I just don't know That he's here for the right reasons. I think he's just rated dishonest," really. I feel like I have a responsibility to let her know Of things that I find out about that are behind her back, and at the same time, I will remain true To the fact that the reason I'm here is because I feel that I'm the right one for her. I just want you to be careful. Okay. Okay? It's easy to make an impression tonight That you're in this for a specific reason, When you are really not... Mm-hmm. And I want you to keep that in mind. Yeah. Okay? I know myself... Mm-hmm. And I know the reasons why I came here tonight. Yeah. I totally admired the way that you cared about work... Mm-hmm. And you've left, but not only that, but you realize that this is more important than work even, and you ended up coming back. Mm-hmm. And I had this... Oh, my gosh! And... And it's yellow! And not only that, but, listen, I have another one to it. (laughs) (laughs) so I have two, and I want to give you one, and... I want you to keep this, okay? This is awesome. And I'm gonna keep the other one... Uh-huh. And--and hopefully one day we can pair them up, okay? Thank you so mh. You're welcome. You're welcome. Thank you. (kisses) you're such a sweetheart. You know that? (laughs) you're a sweetheart. (laughs) this is, like--I love this. You have no idea. Good. Good. And you know what? And I'm-- I really appreciate you, um, reminding me Of a lot of the things that I need to remember About, like, who's here for me and who's not. Right. Ali : Craig r. Pulled me aside and told me he thinks That some guys aren't here for the right reasons. It concerns me. I gave up everything to be here, and I'm afraid that I'm gonna keep someone around That's just gonna break my heart in the end. That's terrifying. I'm here to find the one," And I don't want to be hurt and lied to and played with. (clinks glass) Gentlemen. Not time to take you to a rose ceremony. I'm actually coming to you for a little bit of help tonight. Without a doubt, Ali is here, 100% sincere, For the right reasons, and I-I'm assuming all of you guys are, too, but in seasons past, Inevitably, people have kinda slid by, So... Man : uh-oh. All right, fellas, here's the deal. You've all spent a lot of time together tonight. You know each as- -as well as anybody here, So what I'm asking you to do-- Write down the name or names of a guy that you feel is not here for the right reason. Put that piece of paper in the box, and I'll come back in just a little bit. Ali : don't write this in front of me. (laughs) I don't-- I don't need to see. When Chris brought out the box, I was kind of actually relieved, Because there's half a dozen guys that aren't there For the right reasons, and I'm hoping that none of them Put my name o-on that piece of paper. If I do see my name on there, it's because they're all jumping On me, making fun of what I do, what I have a passion for, and--and that's actually really insulting to me. This is for Ali. It's, like... Man : I think you just need to go with your gut. If I had a pen, I would've already went. Like, someone go. There's a couple people here that don't need to be here. Who gives a (bleep) about their feelings? Like, we all have an opinion to say it. Can you honestly sit here and say, "I'm safe"? There's no way. The ballot box is a big deal. Somebody's going home tonight because of this. Do I think that there's 25 genuine guys here? Absolutely not. (man) no. At the end of the day, it is a competition, but this isn't fun and games. She's the only person whose opinion we're all gonna respect, So if she wants us to put a name down, Then I think we put a name down. Kyle : Chris Harrison comes out. He asks every single one of us to write down a name Of a person that we don't think is right for Ali, We don't think is here for the right reasons, and I'm definitely here for Ali, so anything that'll help her, I think is just positive. We, one person in particular-- They're, like, a professional wrestler. What is that guy's name? Let's just put rated-r. " (laughs) Man : that guy from Toronto, that other guy-- Don't fall for that guy with crutches! (laughs) Man : Justin--he seems like a good guy to me. I mean, yeah, the guy's a pro wrestler. That's pretty funny, but I think that he is, You know, honestly, a-a genuine person. I'm gonna go with another one. I'm gonna go wild card. I wrote down the newsboy- the weather guy. He might be here for the right reason, but he wants to talk about himself all day long. Just hope my name's not on there. That would be pretty sad. I do feel like people hate me. Oh, yeah. I'm sensing-- I'm sensing hatred. Frank, I think, is the energetic type. He's just going all the time. I think Ali is gonna like a more low-key guy. Justin : there are some guys he that I question already, Right off the top. I already had my--my three guys picked out earlier on tonight. Craig--buddy has a bad attitude. Frank was another one. The third person that I did put down on that list was Jason. He's just here for a good time and not actually here for Ali. Better not be my name or else I'll bust you with my foot. As a fellow Canadian, I'm just kidding with you, all right? I still want Ali. (man) Craig, are--are you with a c" or a k"? You look handsome. I appreciate it. It's actually my first suit that I've ever bought. Oh, really? Going all out for me, are you? To be completely honest. (chuckles) that's right. Um, well, First of all I just want to say that, um, I think the whole putting them in the box-- I think that's a great idea. I did put someone's name in there. Okay. Thank you. Sure. You're welcome. You're welcome. And I see you brought your own little box. I did. And here's my box. I'm a creative guy, and I had this idea to make Ali Something to remember me by, and that first impression rose is still on the table. So hopefully she likes it. The night before left, My sister and I, uh, we're talking, and she was like, "you should make her something." And so I did. I made you- I made you a, uh, a heart. And it's actually got two pieces to it. Oh, my gosh. How did you make this? Uh, actually with a-a Jigsaw. Are you serious? Yeah, yeah. It worked out. I love this, and it's, like, so my style. You like it, huh? Yeah. The wood--love it. Perfect. So you have a- thank you. You're welcome. No problem. Thank you so much. Definitely. I love this. So tell me about your sister. You said you and your sister. Oh, that's Leah. She's older than myself, so I'm 24-- Okay. She--she teaches you good lessons. Oh, yeah, I guess. She tries, I guess. Ali : mm-hmm. We don't have to write someone's name down, right? We don't have to. Man : no, you don't. If we don't think somebody's here not for her, I don't think we should have to write someone's name down. The dude with the toupee-- He's a little too outspoken, a little too cocky for me. He's a (bleep). If--if you think there's no one here that you've met That you actually feel strongly that's... Shouldn't be here that you've met, that... (man speaks indistinctly) Craig, dude, man up. Put a name down. Send somebody home. I don't think you should just make up a name and write someone down. I put Craig m. 's name down. It's just kind of childish To argue over the whole thing. I think if anyone had a problem with the box, It's probably because they're worried That their name's gonna go down there. Suck it up. You have to take accountability for that, and if everyone puts your name down, deal with it. So we just got through writing down names in the box. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I just hope it helps. You know? Uh, the guys should be here for the right reasons. Mm-hmm. I hope that, you know, the names that are in there-- I'm not saying that they will go home. Just maybe it will make you think deeper... Mm-hmm. And maybe figure out why they're here. Exactly. I mean, you know, At first, you know, when Chris brought out the box, I was shocked as everybody else. But I know that you guys know each other better than me, so... Better than you, and I think that's the toughest part of this. But I think you're gonna make the right choices. I think you will. Thank you. I love your accent. It's very cute. So where did you think I was from Right when you heard--when you heard me talk the first time? I just knew you were a Southern boy. That's all I knew. So does that bother you? No, no. No? There's something really, you know, charming and good To be said about the Southern boys and how they're raised. Absolutely. And my Dad would be totally upset If I wasn't that way. (chuckles) Oh, yeah. He would get on to me for sure. Yeah. But, uh, I'm 31 years old. Mm-hmm. I've done it by the book, it seems like, so far. I've been, ever since I was 22 years old... Mm-hmm. I've been working, working, working, Trying to do the right thing, this, that and the other, and I got to the point where I'm like, you know what? I just want to do somethin' I'm passionate about. Mm-hmm. I want to do something that's fun that I like to do... Mm-hmm. Because life's too short not to have fun. Mm-hmm. And you seem like you're the type of person who likes To have fun, too, so... Just a little. (laughs) Just a little bit. This night has been amazing, and these guys are great. I think there's numerous ways I can figure out Who to give the first impression rose to. I could do who made me laugh the most. I could give it to who seemed the most nervous, and I want to make them feel good about themselves. I'm choosing to give it to the guy that I feel, first off, That I could end up with. Man : here she comes. Oh, hey! Wow. Take a seat. (whispers) this. ? dun-dun-dun ? That sucks. Yeah, she just dumped us. That does suck. Oh, I was so, like, oh, my God! Really? (giggles) Tease, tease, tease. That was a tease. Hey there. Man : hey there. (sing song) hi, guys. How are you? Man : good to see you. (giggles) hi. (sighs) so... Man : what now? Roberto, can we talk outside? Yeah, sure. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. I can't complain. Salsa. I should have tried harder. Uh... (giggles) Um, this is the first impression rose, Um, and I wanted to give it to you. You just made me feel really at ease, and you're sweet, and you taught me something new, and it's just... I feel really comfortable with you, and-- Okay. I feel the same. I feel the same. We're good. Uh, so I want to offer this to you In hopes that you'd accept it. Absolutely. All right. Okay. I'm gonna put it right here. Like a professional. Oh, yeah. I'm just shaking like crazy right now. That's so cute. (laughs) it looks wonderful on you. I really never imagined getting the first rose. I didn't know what to expect coming into this. Um, and honestly, it's definitely a good thing. I know that she at least felt some of what I felt, and that--that's the part that feels good about it. This is really cool. I mean, I'm pumped. I'm pumped. This is--this is so cool. Man : hey, Rico suave. That's what we'll start calling you. Man : salsa? Eat that on chips. I was a little upset. I mean, Roberto did some hot sauce dance or something, but hopefully I caught her eye enough To at least get a rose. I definitely expected more of myself, and I definitely don't want to go home period, but I definitely don't want to go home tonight. I just wish I had a second shot. (glass chimes) All right. Now it is time for the rose ceremony. But before we get to that, A little business to take care of. Earlier tonight, I asked you for some help. I know this exercise put you on the spot a little bit. But turns out you had a pretty strong opinion. There's one gentleman here that actually received An overwhelming amount of votes As the guy who is not here for the right reasons, A guy that could potentially break Ali's heart. So now, Ali, you have a decision to make. I'm shaking. Paulie. Ali, you can choose To send this guy home immediately, Or you can choose to trust him, Believe he's here for the right reasons, Give him that rose, and he's safe through tonight's rose ceremony. Obviously, I'm not gonna put you on the spot To make that decision right here. Take some time. Talk to this gentleman. All right. The gentleman that received An overwhelming amount of votes... Justin. Really? Wow. I'm floored. I'm--I'm... Wow. Come on. Excuse me, gentlemen. (grunts) (grunts) I am upset. I'm definitely worried that I can actually Be going home right now. I can't go home tonight. I'm not. You know, I refuse to. I'm definitely ready to fight for her. Hopefully she'll see that I'm being honest and talking From the heart, and hopefully I'll get A rose at the end of it. Honestly, the reason why I'm here is for you. And I'm not here to play games. I'm here to actually not only Meet a wife but also be your best friend. I mean, he got called out. Like, dude's gotta do his work On that one-on-one. It's a hell of a conversation. Man : I hope she doesn't give him a rose. I don't know. Why--why do you think that? I think it's the wrestling thing. A couple of the guys-- Well, actually, a lot of the guys-- Were almost attacking me. I felt like I had to defend myself, and I was, like, really taken aback by that. I'm like, 'cause this is something That I'm passionate about. You think she's gonna boot him or keep him, though? I say boot. I think boot. I think they gotta boot. Might have not, you know, been appropriate to kind of show that On the first day, but you know, again, It's something that's important to me, and I wanted to express that. Um, okay. Let's go in and face the guys. Okay. Oh, man. Oh, here she comes. Here she comes. Look. (whispers) hi. Chris : yes? So, Ali? Have you made a decision? Mm-hmm. What would you like to do? Okay. I want to say thank you, guys, For doing this. I know it wasn't easy for anybody, including Justin Or myself or any of you, and, um... I'm going to give Justin this rose. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. No, thank you. I think she made a mistake. I feel like he is the guy that I need to keep my eye on. Thank you. Justin should go home right now. I just don't trust him, and I don't trust him for her. I'm just skeptical of a guy like that. Well, Justin, congrats. You're safe. Thank you. As for the rest of you, It is time for our first rose ceremony. So, Ali, if you would, come join me, and, gentlemen, We'll see you at the rose ceremony. Thank you, guys. Seriously, thank you so much. ? So now... Gentlemen, good evening. Welcome to your first rose ceremony. I know you all had an interesting night. Justin, Roberto, the two of you already received roses. Nothing to worry about. As for the rest of you, 15 more roses to hand out. So eight of you will be going home tonight. I wish you all the best, and if you're ready, Here's Ali. Right here. Okay, thanks. Hi, guys. Men : hi. Thank you so much, every one of you, for being here. I know what it's like and I never expected it to be this hard. I-I have such a great group of guys, and if you don't get a rose tonight, it's not personal. This night was long because it took me forever To make these decisions. So thank you. (sighs) ? Jesse. (Ali chuckles) Jesse, will you accept this rose? I will. Thank you. Ty. Excuse me. Hi. How you doing? Will you accept this rose? Absolutely. Thank you so much. Craig r. Craig, will you accept this rose? Of course I will. Tyler b. Tyler, will you accept this rose? I would love to.

(whispers indistinctly) Hunter. Thank God! Will you accept this rose? I guess so. Most definitely. Craig m. Craig, will you accept this rose? Absolutely. (whispers) thank you, Craig. Jonathan. (grunts) Oh! (chuckles) Jonathan, will you accept this rose? Mm... Yes, I think so. Ali, gentlemen, it's the final rose tonight. When you're ready. Kasey. ? Thanks. Kasey, will you accept this rose? Yes. Thank you. Gentlemen, I'm sorry. If you did not receive a rose, Take a moment. Say your good-byes. (indistinct conversations) Ohh. Good luck with everything. Thanks for coming. You're welcome. See you later. Kyle : I came here with an open heart, ready to fall in love, and I honestly thought Ali was the right one. I really did. She said she likes to fish. She said she likes to outdoors, and obviously, it's not what she wanted. Now honestly, for my first time in my life ever, I actually really do feel like a failure. Huh. I can honestly say that. Take care. Thank you for coming. I really appreciate it. Tonight I told Ali, you know, why I'm called shooter." Thought it would be kind of cute to ease the moment and make h feel comfortable. I guess she didn't see it, and I think I kind of got it off to a bad start. I'm so (bleep) mad that I made a fool of myself. Wasn't like I planned it to be originally. I'm going home. I wish I could have made a better impression. It was really hard decision. I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was. Good luck to you, sweetie. Thanks so much. Take care. Thank you. You, too. See you. I'm feeling pretty deflated. I was 100% ready to fall in love with Ali. I mean, she was beyond my expectations. I'm kicking myself because I just didn't bring it. I would have sent myself home if I was--if I was her. I wish I could replay that night again. I mean, jeez, I just never brought who I am to her tonight, you know? It sucks. Definitely tough to walk away from this one. It's tough. It's tough, man. I'm so excited about the group of guys I have here. We have so many exciting things in store for us. And, uh, I couldn't have hoped for a better-- Better bunch. So I hope you guys are all ready For a little fun and hopefully to fall in love. So cheers. Absolutely. Cheers. Men : cheers!

Man : to have that intimacy th her Was something I've been waiting for. Man : when we got away from everybody, It was very sexy, very intimate. Man : kissing Ali is breathtaking. Ali's lips just lock perfectly with mine. Man : one woman and a bunch of guys? This could get ugly. An) bottom line is, I'm here for her and I'm willing to do anything for her. Ali : it doesn't surprise me that Justin did this. He's a really stand-up guy who I feel like Would go above and beyond for the woman he loves.

Man : they said he went to the hospital, and I was like, oh, man. Did he do something crazy? He didn't hurt himself, did he? (Ali) I can't even speak right now. I'm so shocked.

(sobs) right now, I can't help but think, like, There's something wrong. (cries) I don't know what to do. Man : some fairy tales you don't believe, and then they happen. Man : this is a dream come true. This whole experience- I don't want it to end. Ali : people say that when you're in love, Everything is more beautiful. And being here, the sky is bluer. It's so wonderful. Man : you know, I didn't come here Expecting to feel this strongly about Ali so quickly. Ali : dancing with him-- It feels like the start of something beautiful. I feel like nothing in my life could ever top that moment. Man : this could be the most beautiful people on earth. Ali : you know, I have some butterflies and I'm excited, and I just think that's so amazing. Man : as far as I can see, I'm gonna be the guy that stands at the end of the road, Kneeling, proposing to Ali. We're gonna live happily ever after. Man : imagining myself proposing to Ali in Tahiti Is--it's a dream come true. Ali : Tahiti is the perfect place to fall in love.

Man : there's no way I could propose to Ali Unless she's ready to fall in love with me. Ali : I gave up everything to be here and hopefully find the man that I'm gonna be with forever.
