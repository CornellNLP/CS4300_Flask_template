 ANNOUNCER : Previously, on AMC's "Feed the Beast"... 
 Tommy Moran : You know what? I've had enough. I don't need this. All right, we have a deal. One condition, I get to see my grandson every week. I'll need to see this contract in 48 hours. I don't know what arrangement you have, but be careful. You're all I got. Where'd you get those bruises? You hit my kid? We are not doing business with my father! Something wrong? All good. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (SIZZLING) (WATER RUNNING) What do you mean the restaurant's not happening? What are you doing? What the hell? I had a fight with my dad. He hit T.J. What?! I found bruises on him, so I went to my dad's house, and I... Oh, dude, no, no. You got it all wrong. Look, I saw T.J.'s bruises yesterday before he went to your dad's. T.J.'s getting bullied at school. What? In hindsight, I probably should have mentioned it. Probably? Look, I knew you'd overreact. I didn't overreact. I reacted. Hey, you had a throw-down with our investor, who's in a wheelchair. Yeah, well, if you'd told me about the bruises, it never would have happened. You're right. All right. I'm... I'm sorry. So, T.J.'s getting bullied? Who is it? I got to report this. Dude, dude, dude, please, come on. Just... Just slow your roll, huh? T.J. made it clear he wants to handle this himself. Wait a minute, what, my s... My son's talking to you now? Y-You'll only make it worse. Yeah? Well, I'm the father, okay? I got to do something. T., Just think back to when you were getting your ass kicked. All right? Look, if your dad had come to school saying his son was getting bullied, what do you think would have happened? Huh... What, your beat-downs would have been exponentially worse. Yeah? Well, lucky for me, my dad couldn't care less. Look, you're not remembering what it was like to be a kid. I remember exactly what it was like, okay? It was hell. Until some little crazy-ass punk pulled a knife on those guys and got them to leave me alone. Look, T.J. doesn't have a friend like you. Look, you are gonna apologize to Aidan, though, right? I'm not doing anything until I deal with what's going on with my son. I can assure you that there's a zero-tolerance policy for bullying. Did anyone see it happen? I don't know. Did T.J. indicate who hit him? No. Then how do you know he got the bruises at school? He could have fallen at the park... (SCOFFS) or at home. I know what bruises look like on a kid who's getting beat up. Were you bullied? Or... did something happen at home growing up? How is that relevant? How did you get this? I fell at the park. (PEN CLICKS) What? What is that? Well, statistics show that violence in the home is learned behavior. (SCOFFS) First you threaten to take my kid away. Now... Now you accuse me of beating him? I'm not accusing you of anything. Just relax. Don't tell me to relax! Okay, my son is getting... (SIGHS) I don't keep a violent home. He's getting bullied here, okay? And I can't seem to protect him. Without proof, I can't very well question every kid in the school. Okay, so what... What can you do? I can look into it. It's my priority that T.J. at least feels safe while he's at school. In the meantime, I suggest you lean on T.J.'s support person. Dion seems very committed. I'm glad you got some help. Yeah, Jimmy, that's it. Yeah, remember demo's on Wednesday, okay? Listen, man, I-I'll call you back. Huh? You feel good? Huh? You feel like a good daddy? You tell me, Dr. Patras. What? Support person? (CHUCKLING) Oh, that? Yeah, yeah, that was for you, bro. You know, to get the shrink off your back. So you lied to her. Yeah. Fine. I apologize. Look, see how easy that is? Come on, let's go to Aidan's and do the same thing. No way. You have to. I already hired a contractor. With what money? With the money we're gonna get when you apologize to your dad. The man stuck a gun in my face. All right, fine. I understand. Hey, you know what? Let's see who's next in our magical book of investors, shall we? Come on. Let's take a look. Uh, no. No. And no. You got to walk me through this one more time. The guy's in a wheelchair, and you're standing. He's 70. You're, what, like have his age? He still manages to kick... Okay, would... Would you stop? Look, I'm just trying to figure out the logistics here, all right? All right, just... Just stop. All right, all right, all right. Look, but seriously, if he tries to roll up on you again, I got your back, man. Come on. Quick and painless, bro. Whatever it is, make it fast. I got real business. So...? So, last night, I may have overreacted. You know what? He totally overreacted. T.J. got his bruises from a bully at school, a fact I was unaware of because somebody chose not to tell me. Why are you here? To apologize... and, despite recent misunderstandings, ask if you'll reconsider investing in our restaurant. I never said I wouldn't. We fought. You lost. And we have a contract, which you read, right? Yes. Of course. Well, get to work. You're opening in four weeks. Four weeks? Yeah. I've invited some developers who are building eight square blocks of condos. What better place to pitch them my business than at my new restaurant? And none of that pussy fish crap. These guys are carnivores. So there better be blood coming out of something, besides your v*g1n*. Got a problem? Are you out of your mind? Four weeks? That's... That's not... It's not a problem. No, no, no, it's... We're good. I want to hear the other guy say it. Yeah, we're good. All right, you're good. I'm good. Everybody's good. When I accused you of hitting my son, why didn't you say anything? I wanted to see what you'd do. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) That 75 grand is for start-up costs. Weekly installments to follow. Thank you, Mr. Moran. Quick and painless, bro. (LAUGHS) Man, with this, I can get my Groen braising pan, my Tri-Star 48-inch Radiant Charbroiler. No, you know what? Make that two. Eyes on the prize, baby. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ Fever dream ♪ 
♪ Or so it seems ♪ 
♪ All I see is ♪ 
♪ What used to be ♪ 
♪ Fever dreams ♪

Suddenly, he's back in my life, and I-I don't know how to deal with it. He's, uh... He's the main investor in our restaurant, which means the b*st*rd's actually my business partner. And it's all happening way too fast. And we don't know a damn thing about running a restaurant. That part was all... All Rie's thing. I'm just screwed. Let me lend a hand. I could manage your restaurant for you, just like at my sister's. Oh, that's... that's very sweet, really. But, uh, I mean, I-I can't afford to hire a manager. (SIGHS) Pay me when you can. Really? I mean... could you even handle two restaurants? I can try. I mean, yeah. Thanks. Just let me know when to start. How about yesterday? (BOTH CHUCKLE) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE) Did you put down that dupek chef like I told you to? That dupek chef will be paying us every week, so no. Bullshit. Where's he getting it? From an investor. Patras is opening a new restaurant. So we can collect on his debt and have a place to legitimize our income. And what about that Giordano fig? Don't worry, Pop. I backed him way off. Back him off a bridge. You know why people don't respect me anymore? Because you are soft. I'm not soft. (CHUCKLES) I already took care of Chu's shipment. What do you mean? The Asians' merch is now part of our inventory. I said keep Chu out of our territory, period. Do you even think before you do things? When you mentioned it, I assumed... I never said steal it!  Idiota! Now every gook east of Hong Kong will be looking for this stuff. Divide it up. Hide it in five different places. Don't touch it for a year. Months?! I don't know. Whatever it takes, Jimmy. Okay, wow. All right, my guys will get it done, especially if you're cooking for them. Ha, they'll eat like kings! Hi. Hello. I got you set up in here. Hi. Pilar. You're so great about wanting to jump in, but, uh, with the time I had, this was the best I could do, so... Oh! Man! Ugh. Come in. Sorry. So, yeah, pretty standard stuff. Insurance forms, I-9s, balance sheets. Application for the liquor license. That's important. We've got about $1,240 on account, and we just cashed our start-up check for $75,000. And, uh, where's that? Dion has it. God, yes! I want to have rough s*x with these pans! Whoo! Hey! Give the receipts to Pilar! Yes. Receipts. (CHUCKLES) So... I'm re... I'm... I'm glad you're here. I really should, uh, dive in. Yeah. Yes, please. Um, can I get you anything? Do you want tea or anything? Um, no. Thank you. Okay. Oh, um, door closed, please. Thanks again. (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) Hola, cariña. Hey, Blanca. Qué pasa?  You sound funny. No, I have good news. Did that wine guy ask you out? No, but I'm managing his restaurant. You know nothing about managing a restaurant. I know a few things. I was just wondering... what does an H... VAC mean? Ay,  Dios mío!  Focus on the basics. Keep track of the money. And the windows are stationary? No. Rie's idea was that these were sliding casement windows so that... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a mistake. Nope. What? What do we need two walk-ins for? One is for perishables. The other one is for curing and aging our own meat. That is completely impractical. Dude, dude, our place is called Thirio, right, meaning "beast." Now, if it's called Scallop, sure, fine, whatever, but it's not. Besides, me and Rie already talked this through. Oh, you and Rie already talked this through? Where was I? T., T., you are the most brilliant somm in the whole of the five boroughs. I wouldn't even begin to tell you what to do with your wine list. Just... Just relax, all right? Look, I got this. All right, who am I paying around here? You? It's all there, man. Anna : I get that you're having a hard time, but I want you to know that you're not alone. Other kids are having a hard time, too. Not like you, but they're struggling. Like, there's the two Liams. Liam B. with his asthma. Liam K. has those tantrums. Andre Walker has a very hard time controlling his anger. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (DRILL WHIRRING) Oh, Tommy? You know Mose? Yeah. Hey. Hey. We should hire Mose. To do...? Anything. Well, if I can't afford to pay you, I can't afford to pay him. We need all the help we can get, and Mose qualifies for some kind of privately funded grant. Veterans with Disabilities Reintegration Program. Meaning...? We get paid to have Mose work here. Welcome to Thirio. It feels good to be a part of something. What is that? Oven hood. Impressive. Yeah, it should be for $9,250. Hey, is Dion giving you the receipts? I think so. Oh! Hey. Dang! I thought we were getting the big one! Hey, I'm kidding, man. I'm kidding. Look, hey, I think... I think Pilar should be handling the money, all right? She is our manager. Yeah, it wasn't my idea. Hey, she's working for free, man. See, I told you she digs you. No, the point is that... No, the point is that I run the kitchen. I know what we need. Look, I have to go through her? No. Come on, what's your concern here? Well, first of all... No, no! (LAUGHING) No! Are you kidding me?! That's what I'm talking about! Getting the crew back together! Ohh, how you doing? Ohh! You know, I'd walk through fire for you, brother. Yeah, but you missed your chance on that one, huh? Laugh it up, man. Laugh it up. Val! Listen, I'm nothing without you. Hey, Dion. Look, thanks for doing this, all right? Are you kidding me? You're paying me twice what I was making. Plus, it really helps with me and Pam trying to have a baby. Hey, hey, you know, money's not the only assistance I can provide, huh? (CHUCKLES) That is really very generous of you, Chef. But, uh, we got that part covered. Hey, well, I hear that. I hear that. (CHUCKLES) Okay, all right, listen up, okay, this is gonna be intense. We're opening in less than a month. We got to create a whole new menu. Oh, man, I live for this sh1t! We're in! Yes, Chef! (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) You know, I'm down, yeah? But I got to be honest with you there may be a problem. All right? I got visa issues. I can't afford a lawyer right now. And if it... Shh! Shh! Yeah, you can. Habibi. All right. My man. All right. (CLOCK TICKING) So, what happened at school? Got your ass handed to you, huh? Want to learn to defend yourself? No. Hit it like you mean it. You got to put your weight into it. I fell down an elevator shaft, and I can hit harder than that. Hold the bag. (GRUNTING) Come on. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Right, you feel that? That's power. I tried to teach your father that, but he didn't want to learn. You want to learn? Well, show me you want to learn. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) Keep at it, kid. I got to make a call. All right, first comes the dry-aged beef carpaccio with whipped feta and raw artichoke. Then brodo with a poached egg and Parmesan. And then finally, roasted marrow bones with oyster mushrooms, orange gremolata, and sliced steak. Damn, son! Yeah? Come on, let's get cooking. Hey, Oscar, I want to see that looking paper-thin, right? Paper-thin. Yes, Chef. I want it to look nice and fine. Not too chunky. Yes, Chef. Habib, you good? Hey, you know I love you, brother. Listen, make sure they're swimming in marrow, all right? You know it. Yes, Chef! 
 
 (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) (STAPLE GUN CLACKS) Aah! (GROANS) Please... don't surprise me like that. Afghanistan. Dion, we need to talk. Why do you need $9,000 worth of pans and a $4,000 dehumidifier? And that hood... I don't understand. Welcome to my world. All right, you know what? Taste this. Oh, it's good. Ah, it's good. All right, you see, but "good" 's not good enough. All right, taste this. Mmm! Mmm! Hmm? That's fantastic. Right? Now, one is made from Tommy's skillet from Kmart, and the other one is made from a $700 pan. I'm calling this a teachable moment. Tommy, you have to try this. (CELLPHONE CHIMES) Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Truffles are in! Whoo! Truffle, what?! Ow! (TIRES SCREECH) (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) So, can I assume you were on your way to pay me my vig? Look, it's not due for another three days. 10 grand? Impressive. Yeah, well, at least I'm ahead. You're not even close to ahead. Which is why you're gonna keep this in a safe place for me. Come on, man. That... That is not our agreement. No, our agreement is whatever I say it is. If even one flake of that coke is missing, I'll take all your teeth. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SNIFFS) (BREATHING HEAVILY, SNIFFING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) (INHALING DEEPLY) (KNOCK ON DOOR) Tommy : Dion. (SNIFFS) Yo. We're out of money. What?! Tell him. Out of the 75-plus grand, there's $230, plus whatever you have left. Well, I spent it all on... truffles. Jesus, man! Where'd it all go?! On all your big-ticket items... Your pans, your... Your two walk-ins, that insanely expensive oven hood! Oh, oh, maybe you've forgotten, but Rie wanted that oven hood. Oh, how convenient. Yet another discussion that didn't involve me. You're the wine guy. Yeah, well, now I'm a wine guy who doesn't get any goddamn wine! Fine, we'll... we'll put the money from Aidan to work. Actually, the next month of installments goes to the salaries you promised your staff. W-Where were you in all of this? Hey, hey. Yeah, you're supposed to be our manager! Hey, don't lay this on her, okay? Hey! Hey, you're the one throwing cash around like confetti. You know, why do I ever trust you? You lie, you cheat, you... You only think about yourself. Oh, come on, man. Stop being so over-dramatic. You sound like a high-school girl. Look, just let me figure a way out of this. Oh, really? You gonna figure out how to buy thousands of dollars' worth of wine with 230 bucks? Well, you know, I know a place we can get a ton of wine... for zero dollars. Come on, man. Come on. It's so easy. No. Frank was a good boss. Yeah, well, you know, he fired you. No, I quit, okay? No, forget it. Man, Dion, you're on parole. You get caught ripping off a wine warehouse, they'll put you away for 10 years. You know what? Your wine is that important to me, T. Please, stop. All right, fine. Look, you got a better idea? Yeah, I do... Why don't you sell back some of your equipment? Not happening! All right, God forbid you don't cure your own prosciutto. Okay, fine, look, let's... let's just get a small-business loan. Oh, good. Oh, really, really great thinking because, yeah, you... An alcoholic sommelier, and me... a felon for burning down a restaurant... Go to the Bank of America to get a loan to build up a restaurant in the Bronx! Oh, yeah, come on, man! Let's go put on ties! So, what... So we steal wine?! Who are you? I am who and what you signed up for. Dion, we're not kids anymore. How do you still think like this? Yeah, because if we both don't think like this, then our restaurant, it's never gonna happen. Oh, dude. Dude, you know what? I am beginning to think that you and I have a fundamental difference in how devoted we are to this place. I'm devoted, just not to the extent that I'm gonna break the law. Fine. Yeah, you know what? We'll open the best restaurant this side of the Hudson! Yeah, we'll serve wine out of a box! (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (DOOR SLAMS) (TRAIN RATTLING) Things any better at school? Remember our deal. Something like this happens again, you come to me, right? Hmm? All right. Sweet dreams. Love you. (TRAIN RATTLING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) Call me crazy, but I don't think this guy shot himself in the back. What do we got, a new turf war here? My first thought it's fallout from the Asians' coke getting stolen, but if I was a betting man, I'd put my money on Ziggy Woijchik's crew taking it. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (SPUTTERS) The guy at the store said these taste just like much more expensive wines, and a few hundred dollars could buy a lot of them. (SIGHS) Pilar, um, the quality of the wines is extremely important for a high-end restaurant. Could you at least give it a try? Sure. Wait, no. Don't look. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Taste this one. Not bad, right? (HESITANTLY) Mm-hmm. What do you think it is? An Australian Shiraz from 2011 with an owl on the label, right? Holy crap. Okay. You know what? I want you to try a Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Come. Okay. First... First we look at the color. Is it neon purple or ruby garnet? Crystal clear or slightly hazy? Now we swirl the wine, get some air into it, you know? Let it stretch its legs, release some aromatics. Give it a good swirl. Now we nose the wine. It's wine jargon. You... You smell it. What does the wine tell you? It's better than my stuff. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You know what? Do it again. Really breathe it in. Close your eyes. Mmm. Sun-drenched, overripe wild berries. Dried savory herbes De Provence. Hints of cedar from neutral, old oak. And... And an old-world rusticity, right? Okay, now we take a good sip. Wait, wait, wait. Now, you want to activate all the taste buds front and back, top and the sides. (SLURPING) (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) What do you think? I think I want more. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (LAUGHING) So, I told my sister that the greasy guy with the mullet at the car wash had the hots for her. Total lie, but trust me, Blanca deserved it. (CHUCKLES) Wait, so, how did she do with mullet man? Now he's my brother-in-law. No. (LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) Listen... I know we're not paying you what you're worth for your management experience. And I also know that... That Dion has been... A handful. (BOTH CHUCKLE) You're very polite. I'm... diplomatic. (CHUCKLES) I'm not trying to excuse his behavior, but he... He's had it rough. You mean, um, the prison thing? Nah, long before that. When he was 11, his mom and dad were robbed at gunpoint in the parking lot behind their diner, and they were murdered. Oh, my God. Yeah. We were... We were kids in the neighborhood together. And my mom left my dad and me, uh, when I was a baby. So Dion and I were... Were both kind of orphans at the same time. Oh, but your dad isn't dead. Well, might as well have been. (CHUCKLES) I had no father. But sometimes sad and lonely is all it takes for two people to click. You know, we (CHUCKLES) we spent a lot of time listening to records at his uncle's place. Boyz II Men for me. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Beastie Boys for him. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) He Frisbee-threw my "Cooleyhighharmony" album onto the Grand Concourse, and I punched him in the dick. Ohh. (BOTH LAUGH) I Frisbee-threw his "I'll Communication" into the Hudson, and he punched me in the dick. (LAUGHS) You guys, uh, punch each other in the dick a lot. (BOTH LAUGH) We do. We're friends, you know? We fight and we make up. Please don't let it scare you away. We need you. I  need you. I'd like you to stay. Okay. I'll stay. Good. (CHUCKLES) You're, uh... You're Boyz II Men over Beastie Boys, right? Biggie Smalls. No! (BOTH LAUGH) Nice. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) It's too soon. Rie. Yeah. Oscar. (CELLPHONE RINGING) (CHUCKLES) Sorry. (CHUCKLES) - Hey. Hey. Listen, man, I need your help. Well, I can barely see you. Where are you? Tommy :  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're not at... You're at Frank's! Dion, I told you absolutely not! You're absolutely not involved. I'm totally involved. You... You... I'm talking to you. Look, I just need some help trying to find the wine that you want. No, I don't want any stolen wine. Too late, man. We're already here. Tommy :  "We"? Who's "we"? Get out of there, okay? Just... Just leave right now! Go! No, no, no, not that one. That's... That's... That's five years from maturing. You're five years from maturing. Tommy :  Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's... What's Stavros carrying? No, that's crap. You don't like what I'm stealing, you come down here and get it yourself. Yeah, he's not wrong, man. Right, if you're gonna take something, at least... At least take some Bordeaux. You getting that? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, and the, uh... The Fattoria '07. Tommy :  No, no, no, that's... That's the '09. That's total junk. Don't you know anything? No, we don't know anything, man. You're the somm. Okay, you know what? Go to the next aisle. Yeah, right there. Right there. What, this? Gra... Grab the Châteauneuf. Yes, that stuff's like a dream. Tommy :  Get two cases. Yeah, actually,  yeah, get four. Happy? Huh? Grateful? You want to tickle my balls right now, don't you? Love you, man. (SMOOCHES) (ENGINE STARTS) Pilar? Mose, start loading up. Wait, wait, did anybody get my grappa? Oh, forget your grappa. I'm getting my damn grappa. Fine, we'll get your grappa. Hey! What are you doing here? Ohh! Ohh! Mose, man! What did you do? He surprised me. 2003 red Bottini... Retails at... About $350. And I offer it to you at the low, low price of, hmm, free. Dude, what's wrong? We're here to celebrate, baby. We're on our way. What's the matter? (GROANS) Don't get me wrong. I'm happy about the wine. It's just, you know, Frank. Oh, Frank's insurance will cover the cost. You know, he probably doubled the claim. You know what? We actually did him a favor. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Maybe. Hello? Oh, hey, Blake. What...? No. What? Jesus, what...? That... That's terrible. No, um... No. Thank you. Later. What? Did you happen to leave anything out when you told me about your little wine adventure? No. What you talking about? Any, I don't know, horrific details? No, what? Wait, who was that? That was a wine-rep friend. Apparently, there was a big robbery at Frank's warehouse, and, uh, somebody got hurt... bad. Randy, the security guy? Yeah, oh, that. Yeah, that... Yeah, that was unfortunate. Unfortunate? Randy's got a collapsed trachea and a shattered kneecap. That's called collateral damage. This is not okay. Trust me, he'll live, all right? The important thing is that we got our wine. Damn it, Dion! We're not criminals! This is the kind of sh1t my dad does! But he's successful! T., opening a restaurant in the Bronx is not exactly an easy proposition. You know, if we're gonna make it, you know, we may... we may have to get our hands dirty. I'm not talking about getting our hands dirty. I'm talking about almost killing a guy. Oh, so it's okay to steal $100,000 worth of wine. It's okay to take your dad's dirty money, but, oh, if poor, schmucky Randy gets his leg broken, then, what, suddenly, you have a conscience? No. Yes! All right, fine. Let's talk to Randy. Oh, hello. Is that Randy? Oh, good. Good. 'Cause screw you, Randy! (SCOFFS) Yeah, go on. Say it. (CHUCKLES) No. Yeah, if Randy is what stands between us and our restaurant, say it. Stupid. Oh, really? What, you, uh, you... You don't want to do this restaurant? (SCOFFS) Say it. Screw you, Randy. Okay? No. Come here. Come here. Take a look at this. Huh? Look at all that wine, bro. It's a ours. It's for the restaurant. Now, say it like you mean it. Screw you, Randy. Yeah, Randy was gonna crush Rie's dream. Screw you, Randy. All our sketches, all our hard work, you having to crawl back to your dad... All of that would have been for nothing. Screw you, Randy, you stupid son of a bi... You waste of space! Why don't you just go... Okay, okay, we... We got it. We got it. Good. Hey, T., look at me. Nothing's gonna stop us. Hmm? Nothing. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (SCHOOL BELL RINGS, INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Have one of your parents call me, okay? It'll have to be my dad. My mom's in jail. Okay. Hey, yo, what the hell? A Mexican gal let me in. So, word on the street is someone stole the Asian coke shipment. What, the coke shipment that... That I told you about. Our mutual friend's got it, right? Couldn't say. I'm thinking he does, and he's too smart to put it on the street right now. But nobody keeps cocaine as a hobby, and when he sells it, there's gonna be a lot of cash. I need to find out where he's laundering his money. What do you expect me to do about it? Get in closer with him. Keep your ear to the ground. (MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS) I swear to God, I am  this  close. I have three businesses ready to sign leases on the new lot. Glad to hear it. And I'm happy to report I received a very nice payment from Dion Patras. And the Chinese food is divided and well-hidden. Good. As for the territory of the South Bronx... Aah! (GROANING) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (SHOUTS) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (HORNS HONKING) (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) Hey, Dion, come here. Come here. Look at this. Look. We're bringing it to life. And these wines... My God. Okay, um, here. Here. Taste this. Right? And now this. Oh, my God. (LAUGHS) My God. Where'd the tart come from? Preserved lemon. Val added it to the braised rabbit. Mmm! Meshes right in with that Riesling. Insane, right? Oh, no, really, that... that... That is close to perfect. Tommy? Your dad's here. Why are you here? To introduce Kevin, your Chef. Dion's the chef. You don't get to just show up and say who does what. The contract you signed says I can. Wait... Wait, is that true? I told you there were issues with the contract, and you said they'd go away. Dion Patras, right? It's an honor to have you working for me. Let's get started. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)
