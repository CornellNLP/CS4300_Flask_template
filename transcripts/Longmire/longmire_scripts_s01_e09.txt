 You're listening to Cage lron radio live from the heart of the Cheyenne reservation. 
 [Sighs] 
 My name is D.J. Ross Strongbow. 
 I'll be with you all night long. [ Music ] [ Static ] Man : Somebody help me. He's coming after me. Strongbow : Sir, calm down. We'll try to get you some help. Now, where are you? I'm somewhere on the res. Off of... Somebody help! Quick! Who's following you,  sir? Can you... can you be more specific? I... I don't know! [Glass shatters] Ow! He's shooting at me! He's forced me off the road! Oh, no. He's coming. He's coming! What do you want from me?! Hello? Sir? Are you there? [ Gunshot ] Mathias : Thank you for coming out here so fast. We could use all the help we can get. Appreciate it. [Vehicle door closes] Mathias invite us here? Nope. Just seemed like the right thing to do. Let's hope and pray this is a search and rescue, not a recovery. We pinged his cellphone. No response. So we need to split up and spread out over the res. Give me the map. [Paper rustles] How's a 911 call end up on the radio station? When tribal police switchboard gets slammed, the radio station takes the calls. Helps out. How it ended up on the air? Beats me. It was an accident. D.J. Strongbow said an intern flipped the wrong switch. He did not know he was on live. Any idea who the caller was? A few of us recognized the voice. We think it is Malcolm Eaglestar. Should I know who that is? President of the tribal council. Mathias : Sheriff Longmire. What brings you here? Gunshots on the radio. Glad you're here. We could use the manpower. And lady power. Come on over. Broke the res up into quadrants. Would you and your deputy take the northeast? Happy to. Good. Give me the flares. Anyone finds anything, send up a flare. All right, folks, let's go. Let's move out. I feel like we're in the Twilight Zone... middle of nowhere, creepy road, Mathias being all nice and taking our help. What are we looking at, Henry? 200 square miles? More. But he did say he was run off a road. Well, that narrows it down. Got a call two nights ago from the Denver P.D. Really? What did the Denver P.D. want? Don't know. Didn't answer it. sh1t! [Gunshots] [Metal clunks] [Sighs] That is Malcolm Eaglestar. Wait. Body's been moved. How can you tell that, Kreskin? Geez. Walt! See the way the coffee drips down? If Malcolm had been shot sitting up, there'd be more blood drainage from the wound. Shirt front's nearly clean, so... See that dirt? Yeah. He was shot on the ground. Somebody put him back in the car. What would be the point of moving the body? Good question. Wallet's empty. Robbery? What about the cellphone he used to call the radio station? Doesn't seem to be here. Keep looking. It's got to be here somewhere. Now. This is not good. No. It isn't. I'm not just talking about Malcolm being dead. I'm talking about where he died. What do you mean? He's on your land. Are you sure? Lived on the res my whole life, Standing Bear. I'm sure. Border's 100 yards that way. Much as I hate to say it, this is your murder, Walt. Maybe. Murder didn't happen here. Body was moved. Why would somebody move the body? Maybe they didn't want you in charge of the investigation. They can't stop me from helping you guys. Suppose you could, uh, start by helping me find any of Malcolm's family. Malcolm is divorced. Yeah, but he's got a girlfriend. Jill Littlefox. [Voice breaking] I can't think of anyone who would do such a thing. Malcolm was so well-loved amongst the tribe. Malcolm was married before. Does his ex-wife harbor any animosity toward him or you? [Sniffles] No. Well, when Malcolm first left Anita, it was difficult. But that was years ago. They even serve on the tribal council together now. When was the last time you spoke to Malcolm? He called me last night. Where'd he call from? I don't know. Jill. This is important. Now is not the time to hold anything back. You wouldn't understand. Malcolm was a wonderful, generous spirit. But no man is perfect. Jill, I can promise you neither Walt nor I intend to denigrate Malcolm's character. If there's anything embarrassing about that phone call, it will be kept private. Malcolm was at a poker game. That was Malcolm's weakness. What did he say when he called you? He was excited. He was winning... big. He told me to book an Alaskan cruise for my birthday. You have any idea where this poker game was? No. So... Who gets the money? What money? The money that Malcolm was winning. When he called, he said he was up $20,000. You know of any, uh, high-stakes poker games on the res? Not until Jacob Nighthorse finishes building his casino. All the games that I know of do not have that kind of money on the line. Where's Malcolm get that kind of money to gamble with? I didn't think he was a wealthy man. He was not. As president, he could have access to expense accounts. Or maybe he was taking kickbacks from contractors. I hope not. The man's reputation was beyond clean. The idea that he had a gambling problem or that he was corrupt... that is incendiary stuff. As your campaign adviser, I would keep it to yourself until you have proof. Since when are you my campaign adviser? [Chuckles] Walt, this appears to be a straight-up robbery. Possibly. Robbery's no reason to move the body. [Slaps back] Sheriff. Any news? Can we talk in private? Malcolm Eaglestar had a gambling problem. That doesn't sound like him. No. Wouldn't look good for the president of the tribal council to be a gambler... especially when he's supposed to make rulings on a huge, new casino development. That's a serious accusation, Walt. I'd tread carefully with that one. I know  you  would, Mathias. In fact, I think you already have. I couldn't help but notice how oddly cooperative you've been with me. You even assigned me the search sector where Malcolm's body ended up. And now that I learn what a political hot potato this investigation... What are you getting at, Sheriff? I want you to show me where you found Malcolm Eaglestar's body... before you moved it. This is where I found Malcolm. Recognized his voice and figured he'd be somewhere along the road to his house. He was dead when I got here. Loaded him up, backed out across the same tire tracks, and I drove him over the line. I should arrest you for tampering with evidence. You should, but you won't. Why's that? You've already removed one of our police chiefs from office. You do it again, voters might think you have some sort of vendetta against us tribal cops. And the Cheyenne. You decided to give me a tainted murder right before an election so I wouldn't have a choice. Well, I didn't have any options. You could have solved the case yourself. This is the president of the tribal council, Sheriff. If the killer's from the res, accusing the wrong person could cost me my badge. If the killer's not from the res, I'd have no reach or power to bring him to justice. What if you never find the killer? Then I'm screwed. No, Mathias,  I  am. If anyone takes a fall on this, it'll be me. All this is inadmissible in court. Why you so negative, Sheriff? Hmm? I think you have a better chance at solving this as an outsider than I do as an insider. Much better for you that an outsider exposes your president's gambling problem. Believe it or not, I just want this case solved. Come on, Sheriff. Can you look me in the eye and tell me you've never broke the law for the right reason? You find his cellphone? [Door opens] Ruby. Hi, Walt. Some members of the tribal council are waiting in your office. And Omar just dropped these keys off for you. Said you could use his truck while yours is in the shop. Thanks, Ruby. There you go. Oh, uh, Ruby. Could you call Cady? Tell her her credit-card bill's still coming to my house. Sure. And, uh, could you look up the date that Freddy Whitehawk turned up dead? Uh... That was the 21st. Right. Vic. Vic : Hmm? This is Malcolm's phone. Find out who he called, who called him on the day he died. No way. I... I searched every inch of that crime scene. I have been on with the phone company. They told me it was impossible to trace, that somebody had removed the battery or it was dead. Probably be faster to charge it and get the calls rather than wait for info from the phone companies. Where the hell did you get this? I got a meeting with the tribal elders. Ooh. So, you're a big gambler. You ever play cards with Malcolm Eaglestar? Ah. Oh, wow. Here I thought we were just doing some father-and-son bonding. You have got to work on your subtlety. I do like your intent, however. Nice shot. Thank you. So, you aware of any high-stakes games in the area? That depends. By giving you this information, am I helping you or Walt Longmire? Me. You didn't use the last piece of information I gave you. Well, this information pertains to a murder case, not an election. An election you're gonna lose if you're not careful. [Chuckles] Dad, I know you'd rather see me tear Walt down, but if I can be the one to break open the Malcolm Eaglestar murder case, could mean more votes. [Chuckles] Okay. Okay, we'll try it your way this once. I'll get you an address. Just make sure it can't be traced back to me. But now you owe me one. Man : Malcolm Eaglestar, you have no honor! You ruined my marriage! My life has no worth anymore! When I find you, you're gonna wish you were already dead! [Cellphone beeps] That's the tame one. There's two more that are even more graphic. All the calls were placed from the same blocked number two days ago... I'm gonna have to call the phone company. Guy sounds a little drunk. You know, we've been thinking that this was a robbery, but it sounds like old Malcolm was having an affair with this guy's wife. Malcolm left his first wife, right? It's possible he could be on the prowl again. Think I may have found the location of that poker game, Walt. In my office, Branch. I got a tip that this game's been going on for years. Also got an address. Where'd you get your tip from? Can't reveal my sources. Want me to check it out? No. I want you to go to the Rusty Parrot in Jackson. That's more than three hours away. What am I looking for? I want you to check the registry. See if my daughter was there the day that, uh, Freddy Whitehawk died. The 21st. And check if you were there, too. 'Cause I seem to recall bringing you back from a romantic getaway that night in Jackson. Or you could save yourself the drive, be a man, and tell me to my face. Okay. I was. Dating your daughter for six months. I didn't say anything to you about it because my personal life is none of your business. You're my deputy. That makes it my business. Does that mean when I'm sheriff, I get to snoop around in your private affairs? If you become sheriff, Branch... if. And this has nothing to do with the election. This is about my daughter. Well, you might want to talk to her, then, Walt. 'Cause it was her idea to keep our dating a secret. She didn't think you'd handle the news very well. I can't imagine why. The news I can take. You... that's a different story. Ruby : Walt, where are you? Nobody knows where you are. Detective Fales from the Denver P.D. called again. Please call him back. [ Telephone rings ] [Music] [Skin sizzles] [Grunts] You looking to get scarred? Nope. I'm here for the poker game. This is the only poker around here. Sure you don't want to grab a chair, Sheriff? I'm talking about the poker game that Malcolm Eaglestar played in last night. At this address. Now, what's going on in there? [Indistinct shouting] Guess I better go see for myself. [Grunts] [Laughs] [Skin sizzles] [Music continues] [Grunts] [Laughter] Hands up! Ferg : Hands up! [Shotgun cocks] I have the right to remain silent! Then shut the hell up. And you don't need to assign me an attorney. I got one that'll be your biggest nightmare. Surprise... most of these guys have records. We need to keep a close eye on them... And their friends back at the club. I think you should camp out there. Tell me who goes in and out. You just want me to sit out there? Yep. While you're here, questioning everyone? Great idea. Now, you better get moving. [Clears throat] [Door slams] What the hell was that all about? The usual. Ferg. You. Come with me. I'm not talking. Let's see about that. So, you been a member of this club for how long? [Sighs] That long? Right. Well, your new leathers tell me otherwise. But you got a face for poker. I can see that. But you have a tell... no anger in your eyes. I don't think you're in that gang. Oh, yeah? You owe them no loyalty. I want to know if the name Malcolm Eaglestar means anything to you. He was at that poker game two nights ago. I can't tell you anything. Those guys out there will kill me. I'm not talking. Okay. Vic. Come in here. Bring a pen and paper. [Sighs] You, uh, identify the angry guy from Malcolm's voice mail yet? You sure you want to talk in front of him? He's not talking. What do you got? I, uh, traced the call to a tribe member... Reuben Lamebull. He's not answering his cellphone, but I did get an address if you want to go talk to him. Ferg! Come in here! Bring that tape recorder! Ferg : What do you need me to do? Ah. Go grab us lunch from the Busy Bee. Two chicken-fried-steak sandwiches. No Mayo for Vic. Okay. Wait. What do you think you're doing? Apologies. What do you want to eat? Nothing. Get him a Cobb salad. It's very good. You know, if you sit in here much longer, they're gonna think you're spilling. And when I put you back in that cell, I'm gonna confirm it. And they're not gonna be too happy about that. Or you can tell me what you know, and I can let you slip out that door. And we can make that salad to go. Okay. I'm not in the gang. I was at a biker rally in Sturgis for vacation. On the way back, I heard about the game. Malcolm Eaglestar there? Yeah. The lndian. Like a real one. Yeah, he was up in the game early on. This one hand, he had a deuce pair off-suit, then on the turn... What did he come away with? Nothing. He lost it all in a few hands. He left broke? You sure? Jeff : Oh, yeah. Oh, that guy would have bought in again if he had any cash left on him. Jeff, I think you should get out of town as soon as possible. Vacation's over. [Door opens] [Sighs] No cash on him. I guess robbery is looking less and less like the motive. So that leaves Reuben Lamebull's threatening voice mails. 
 
 [Knock on door] Ruby : The lawyer for the club is waiting for Walt. He can say what he wants. I'm not letting those bikers go. They're running an illegal card game. Well, their illegal winnings have been posted as bail. But that's almost beside the point. That lawyer is also here to file an excessive-force charge against you. Vic : It's all subjective. One man's "excessive force" is another man's "gentle persuasion." Nobody died, right? Ferg, help Ruby deal with that lawyer. Vic, let's you and I go find Reuben Lamebull. Walter. This is a serious matter. I'll deal with it later. You want me to call Cady? No. I do not. [Sighs] Did you know that Branch was dating Cady? Why didn't you tell me, Vic? You know, there are things that you don't tell me, too. Like how you miraculously found Malcolm's cellphone. But you know what? I figure you have your reasons. What are your reasons for not telling me? No proof. If I've learned anything from you, it's to not talk until the facts are on my side. I know this sucks. But you can't let it get to you. [Engine shuts off] Nothing gets to me. Yeah? Mrs. Lamebull? For the moment. If you're looking for Reuben, he ain't here. Is that his handiwork? It's a lovers' quarrel. It's not like he got out of it without one himself. So, why did you fight? What day is it? Was it because you were sleeping with Malcolm Eaglestar? [Laughs] Hell, no. Reuben accused Malcolm of destroying his marriage. Well, I  am  divorcing Reuben because of the letter Malcolm sent. What letter? The letter telling Reuben that he's getting kicked out of the tribe. "Disenrollment," they call it. What did he do to get disenrolled? Oh, could be anything. He's a real prick. So, you're divorcing your husband because he got kicked out of the tribe? Well, without tribal membership, Reuben wouldn't get tribal benefits, including a share of the casino profits, and that's worth thousands of dollars a month. And without the money, I just don't see the point of being married to him. Sue me. I'm a gold digger. Darla, you think it's possible Reuben could have killed Malcolm Eaglestar? You think he killed that guy? Over me? Huh. Reuben was kicked out of the tribe for an unknown reason. He felt cheated out of money from the casino. He blamed Malcolm Eaglestar. Darla said that Malcolm sent him the disenrollment letter. Those went out already? [Sighs] I heard the council was still debating that issue. Well, someone decided something. Malcolm recently introduced a controversial resolution to change the blood-quantum requirements for membership in the tribe. Sorry. "Blood quantum"? To be considered a member of the tribe, you have to be a certain percentage of Cheyenne blood. Based on the new rules, some people who have been considered members of the tribe their whole lives would be suddenly out. Reuben must have fallen below the new blood requirement. Why make a law like that now? To thin out the ranks. Less members... it means a bigger share of the profits from the new casino. You got any idea how many people were disenrolled? I don't know for sure, but I heard it was somewhere around 60. 60?! That really narrows down our suspect list. Why didn't any of you think to mention this blood-quantum resolution? We were still in the midst of trying to figure out how to handle such a delicate situation. No one was aware that Malcolm had sent those letters. One of the affected tribe members, Reuben Lamebull, made some pretty serious threats to Malcolm. Vic : And I got to believe he's not the only one who was pissed off by this, which is why we asked you to give us a list of everyone who received one of those letters. Henry and Mathias will track down everyone on that list to see if they've got an alibi. Shouldn't be too hard to find most of these people. Half of them are old and infirm. Laura Howlingcrane is in a wheelchair. Horace Dullknife... he's 80. That resolution never should have passed. Vic : More than half of you voted for it. Anita : Actually, we didn't. Malcolm used a legislative trick to get it through. He called a meeting when he knew several of us couldn't attend. Then he put a motion to a vote. And it barely passed. It wasn't a trick. You were invited to the meeting. On a Friday night when you knew Anita and I were in Pine Ridge. Look, it wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one. I don't want some white kid who says he's 1/32 Cheyenne taking money out of our pockets. How can you banish someone who has lived his entire life as a Cheyenne? That is who they are. This is not just about money. This is about people losing their culture. Sometimes, we have to make decisions [Cellphone rings] that are bad for individuals but good for the tribe. Malcolm did this for himself. He didn't think about the good of the tribe. He was swimming in gambling debts. And he saw this as an easy way to pay them off. I was his wife! I knew him better than most. And I know he sold out his tribe to get out of debt. Actually, that's not true. Malcolm had no debts. You don't know my husband. I'm not saying that he didn't struggle with a gambling problem. But I am saying that he owed no one money. Why are you so certain of that, Jacob? Because I bought his debt. You bought it? I did. I wanted to make sure no one could influence his decisions, no one could force him to act against his own judgment. He may have had demons, but he was his own man. That was Mathias. We got a situation with Reuben Lamebull. Test me again! Test my blood again! You got to put the gun down, Reuben, or we can't talk. I am Cheyenne. I'm more Cheyenne than any of them! Calm down, Reuben. [Glass breaks] Aah! This is Cheyenne blood! Test it! You'll see! Test me again! [Sobbing] [Handcuffs clicking] Dude is whacked, but his gun is a different caliber. It doesn't match the one that killed Malcolm. No. Didn't seem like Reuben knew anything about that poker game, either. So motive, but no opportunity. Hey. Hey. Hey, Punk. I just got off the phone with the motorcycle club's lawyer. He's not messing around, Dad. I'll be all right. You can't keep avoiding the situation. Just watch him. Dad. Those bikers, they said that you used excessive force. This is not a nuisance suit. That is a serious charge. You believe them? If it was just one, maybe not, but there are 10 of them on the complaint. D.B. Turner, Jonas White, Mika Dullknife... [paper crinkles] [Door closes] Dad. Please. I'm trying to help you. I... I'm doing this because I care about you. Care about me?! Sleeping with Branch?! That's how you show you care about me?! Since I got that credit-card bill of yours... [Scoffs] You read my mail? Glanced at it. I thought it was mine. I saw the charge from the Rusty Parrot. You stand there and talk to me, go to breakfast with me, hug me. All this time, all the while dating Branch behind my back? Only thing I can come up with... you wanted to hurt me. Yeah, well, you know what? That's not true. Because if I wanted to hurt you, I would have told you! Dad. It was just... it was just something that happened. It really wasn't about you. He works for me! He's trying to take my job away from me! Well, you weren't running when we got together, okay? And it seemed like you were ready to retire and... and pass the reins off to a deputy. You told him to run. No, I didn't tell him to run. But I didn't discourage him. I can't believe this. I can't believe  you. Who are you to tell me who I can and can't see? [Crying] I've put my whole life on hold to be here and take care of you! I've spent the last year of my life trying to put you back together! And what about me?! What about my life, Dad?! I'm sorry I've been such a burden. Allow me to relieve you of that burden. Well, not that you care, but we broke up two weeks ago. [Door slams] Vic! We have been working down the list of disenrolled members. Lots of angry people. But lots of older people with alibis. There's one guy on that list whose name came up at that meeting... Horace Dullknife. Talk to him yet? Yeah. Horace is part of the planning committee for the basketball tournament. They had a potluck dinner that night. Lots of witnesses. Horace have a son named Mika? I believe he does. Presumably, if a father doesn't meet the new blood requirements, his children aren't going to, either. That depends on how much Cheyenne blood the mother has, but, in most cases, yeah, you're right. I saw Mika Dullknife's name on a complaint filed against me by a biker gang. If he's in that gang, means he knew that Malcolm was at that poker game that night. Motive meets opportunity. How you gonna bring him in? I know Mika. I seriously doubt he's gonna come along peacefully. I may need your help. I'm listening. [Engine shuts off] [Scoffs] Hey. You seen this guy? Yeah. He went in around 10:00. Hasn't come back out. Are you a moron, by the way? I don't remember asking for your opinion on the matter. You don't sh1t where you eat, Branch. She's an adult. She made her own decision. Fine, then don't sh1t where  I  eat. I'm done talking to you about... Whatever. Vic. Just so you know, the word is out. He took it out on Cady this afternoon. Mika's inside. Good. Ferg. Hop in. Vic. You and Branch go in the front entrance. Ask for Mika. If he comes peacefully, take him. I'll head to the back in case Mika tries to run. We'll go in the front. Yeah. [Music] [Needle buzzing] We're looking for Mika Dullknife. Come on, man. This is harassment. Not yet, it isn't. But if that's what you want... Think he's in the stockroom. I'll go get him. We'll come with. [Cellphone beeps] [Ringing] [Engine turns over] [Music continues] [Engine revs] Take him! [Tires screech] Time for plan "B." [Music continues] Mathias, we're headed towards the reservation off Route 14. We need to get him off the highway. Are you in position? Good to go. [Horn honks] [Horn blares, tires squeal] [Tires screech] [Engine revs] [Glass shatters] [Walt grunts] Hey! Let go of me. I'm arresting you. What for? For killing Malcolm Eaglestar. You can't do nothing to me on res land. That's true. Except Malcolm Eaglestar was killed off the res in my county. We're a little more aggressive about prosecuting murderers. [Siren wails] No, man. He was on the res. How would you know that? Unless you're the one who shot him. All right. You got me. I did it. He begged for mercy, and I didn't give it. You should be ashamed. All those people Malcolm kicked out of the tribe were good people! Malcolm betrayed them. And for what? So he could gain some more money from some casino?! So he could squander it at the poker table? Laughing as he lost? No. Malcolm deserved to die a coward's death. There's nothing you can do about it. But there is, Mika. I wasn't tricking you before. I found his body in his car off the res. No, man. We were on the res. I know it. Should have brought a map, Mika. That body was in the county. Then somebody moved him. Now, who would do a thing like that? You do what you got to do with me, Sheriff. I'm good with myself. My family's gonna be rewarded for what I did. [Spits] What do you mean, your family's gonna be rewarded? Sheriff. Jacob. To what do I owe the pleasure? I just gave my report to the tribal council. I'm sure they appreciated that. They did. I also found out that Anita is taking over as chairman until an interim election can be held. And they're deciding now who'll take over her lower-level position. Apparently, you're the front-runner, which confused me, since you're not a member of the Cheyenne tribe. That's right, because I don't meet the blood-quantum requirement. Did you know that the U.S. government only quantifies three things by blood? Dogs, horses, and lndians. I've never seen dogs or horses exploit their own kind for personal profit. You are a cynical man. You know that? I'm not cynical... just suspicious. Suspicious that all these terrible things happen, and somehow, when the dust settles, you're a candidate for the tribal council. Couldn't that just be my good fortune? Could be. Or it could be this... you buy Malcolm's debt. You talk him into passing legislation that raises the blood quantum. Then you find Mika, who's especially angered by the disenrollment. You convince him that if Malcolm is somehow removed from the council, you will take over the vacant post and repeal the blood quantum. And his family will be reinstated back into the tribe. You overestimate me, Walt. I think you might underestimate me, Jacob. [Golf club hits golf ball] [Vehicle door opens] [Vehicle door closes] [Sighs] Tried to warn you. I know. I'm sorry. I've been avoiding your calls because I thought you were trying to get back together. [Chuckles] I was the first couple days, but I get it. You made it pretty clear that we're done. You all right? He's pretty mad. [Chuckles] Well, you did kind of lie to him for six months. So did you. He'll get over it. [Chuckling] With you, yeah. You're his daughter. But me? Branch, I am so sorry. Don't be. I don't regret a single moment. But you do realize that I really only have two choices now. What do you mean? Well, either I got to quit, or I got to beat him. And I'm no quitter.
