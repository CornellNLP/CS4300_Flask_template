 [Distorted shouting] 
 [Children shouting] 
 [Screaming] 
 Morning, ma'am. 
 Had some complaints from the neighbors about the noise. 
 You mind keeping it down? 
 [Laughs] 
 Dad, you really got to get new material. 
 [Laughs] If it's not broke... 
 So, breakfast, huh? 
 Should we go to the Busy Bee or... 
 The Busy Bee? 
 You choose. 
 Okay. [Sighs] Let's go. 
 What? 
 So, when do I get to meet him? 
 What are you talking about? 
 New lock on the door. 
 Yeah, the old one was sticking, so I had it replaced. 
 And this one's installed wrong. 
 That's not the work of Durant Lock and Key. 
 What if I did it myself? 
 You put in a dead bolt? 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. It's not that hard. 
 The screws aren't flush. 
 You don't do anything unless it's perfect. 
 And you're blushing. 
 [Scoffs] 
 When do I get to meet him? 
 I'm not dating anyone. 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Phone's ringing. 
 Hello? 
 Oh, hey, Ruby. 
 Yeah, he's right here. 
 Boy still had some cash in his pocket. 
 He told me he didn't have anything. 
 Walt : Can't be more than 18, 19 years old. 
 Looks like blunt-force trauma. 
 There's no weapon around. 
 Maybe her head got slammed against one of these rocks. 
 Found some cash in her purse. 
 No wallet, no I.D. 
 I found this in her back-right pocket. 
 "Vaeah net fah... fah mich iss,  iss gayich mich." 
 What is that... German? 
 Nein. Das glaube ich nicht. 
 What? 
 I don't think so. 
 Body glitter. Cash is mostly singles. 
 She's a stripper. 
 Right side's scratched up. 
 Strawberry on her thigh bone, tears in the jeans. 
 Looks like she didn't go quietly. 
 Overzealous customer? 
 There's no sign of sexual assault, but we won't know for sure until they get the autopsy back. 
 Do you want me to bring the truck down here? 
 It'll be easier to load her up. 
 Call an ambulance. 
 This girl was someone's daughter. 
 Deserves better than the back of my truck. 
 Go back to the office, get everyone up to speed. 
 I'll wait with the girl. 
 [Wind whistling] 
 Branch : $1,237. Know what that means? 
 You can add? 
 [Chuckles] She's not local. 
 Hey, Walt. Girl's not local. 
 You know her? 
 Nope. 
 Never seen her, but I know she's not working around here. 
 We didn't even call into that club yet. 
 What's it called... Dirty Shirley's? 
 Don't need to. 
 Look, I was at Dirty Shirley's for Ken Taylor's bachelor party a month ago, and those girls are not bringing in this kind of money. 
 This much coin, it's got to be Oden. 
 Vic : Oden? 
 Town two counties over. 
 Well, not a town. It's a boomtown. 
 Oden just discovered they're sitting on one of the biggest oil reserves in Wyoming. 
 Lucky bastards. 
 Makes you wonder what's sitting under Durant. 
 We could do with a little boom. 
 [Chuckling] No sh1t. 
 Maybe then somebody would put in a decent pizza place. 
 At least it would mean more jobs. 
 It would also mean more crime. 
 And victims, like the young woman whose name we still don't know. 
 Now you get over to Doc Bloomfield, roll out a fresh copy of our victim's fingerprints. 
 Run it to the DMV in Cody. 
 She had a license. They can check it against her thumbprint. 
 Vic and I will check out the clubs in Oden. 
 Vic : $1,200 a night times 5 days a week... 
 4 weeks in a month. 
 A stripper makes more in two months than I do in an entire year! 
 Do you know  I  can dance? 
 And I always thought I had a really nice ass. 
 Maybe I should put in an application. 
 Would you be my reference? 
 No. 
 [Laughs] Ohh. 
 So, uh... 
 Vic, um... 
 Have you heard if, uh, Cady's dating anybody? 
 Where the hell did that come from? 
 It's a long drive. I'm... conversation. 
 I have no idea. 
 Your daughter and I aren't exactly BFFs, Walt. 
 Why don't you just ask her yourself? 
 I did. Said she wasn't seeing anyone. 
 Well, there you go. 
 Of course, you don't have to date somebody to sleep with them. 
 [ Music ] 
 [Clears throat] 
 [ Music continues ] 
 [Indistinct shouting, laughter] 
 Can I help you, Sheriff? 
 Looking for this girl. Hannah. 
 She's not here. Is there a problem? 
 If you can just give me her current home address. 
 Buddy, everybody wants the girls' addresses. 
 You got a warrant? 
 I do. It's on its way. 
 I'll just wait till it gets here. 
 [ Music continues ] 
 [ Music ] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Ma'am, my hat. 
 Please. Ma'am. 
 Girl could get fired talking to a sheriff in here. 
 Why are you asking about Hannah? 
 She's due in court. Unpaid parking tickets. 
 Okay, she doesn't even own a car, so I know that's bullshit. 
 So, you know Hannah? 
 Yes. I give her rides home. Such a sweetheart. 
 Now, you've got me worried, so tell me... why are you  really  asking about her? 
 I'm trying to help her. 
 So, the sooner you tell me where she lives, sooner I can do just that. 
 Please, ma'am. 
 I've never dropped her off at a house, per se. 
 Just at a convenience store on Ducaine Road over in Absaroka County. 
 From there, she likes to walk. 
 You never seen where she lives? 
 Sheriff, we take our clothes off for a living. 
 We hold on to any little privacy we can. 
 Would you want one of these guys following you to  your  door? 
 [Sighs] 
 So, she doesn't have a car. How does she get to work? 
 Someone drops her off. Never seen who. 
 But you don't forget a car that ugly... little puce-colored sedan. 
 Puce? 
 Yeah. You know, sort of pinkish-brown. 
 Hey, Vic. There's that convenience store. 
 Keep your eyes peeled. 
 Would you call that puce? 
 [ Music in distance ] 
 What happened to your coat? 
 Not that cold out. Now, come on. 
 Sheriff's department. [ Gun cocks ] 
 [ Gunfire ] 
 Right there. You like that? 
 Yeah! 
 Oh, yeah! That's right. 
 [Laughs] 
 What the hell? 
 [Gasps] 
 Kennsht doo see? Vaeah sin see? 
 Sit your ass down! 
 Caleb?!  Vahs iss un gayuh? 
 Kennsht doo see? Vaeah sin see? Caleb : I'm working on it! That note... I think it might have been written in Pennsylvania Dutch. What? Stripper's Amish. [Music stops] [Inhales deeply] You Amish sure know how to party. We're not Amish. We're Mennonites. Vic : Well, you  Mennonites sure know how to party. What's the occasion? Rumspringa. I'm sorry. "Rum" what? Rumspringa. It means running around, letting loose. It's a rite of passage for Mennonite kids. We leave home to experience the real world. We're on our own. No adults. We got to choose whether we're gonna live like you English or like Mennonites. How do you know what Rumspringa is? I read. Now, we're looking for a woman who lives here... Hannah. You know her? Yeah. She's my sister. Is she in trouble? There was an incident at work. At the diner? Did someone steal her tips again? Something like that. We're gonna need to see her room, get a picture of her, make sure we got the right person. [Curtain slides] When was the last time you saw your sister? Yesterday afternoon. I never heard her come in from her shift. Should I be nervous? Vic : It's just standard questions. You ever drive your sister to work? I don't have a license. We just have the one car. Everyone uses it. Catch rides when we can. So, this is your sister? Yeah. She dating this guy? I don't know  him. A lot of guys like Hannah. I make it a rule not to ask my sister about her love life. What does this have to do with her work? That's what we're trying to figure out. Hey, Samuel... Would you be able to translate a note for us? We think it's Pennsylvania Dutch. Yeah, sure. Good to know. Uh... We're gonna need to talk to your parents. Okay. They're in the Mennonite colony in Ashlan. It's a few miles from here. I know where it is. Why don't you come with me to talk to them? I... I can't. I'm sorry, but I... I can't go home... Unless it's for good. I... I... I'm not allowed to see or talk to my parents. T... that's... it's... it's how Rumspringa works. I understand. I don't want to upset tradition. Just an address will do. The kid needs to know what happened to his sister. Parents deserve to hear it first. I'll radio back after I talk to them. You can tell him then. In the meantime, impound the puce car so we can have it checked for prints. You can catch a ride with the tow truck. Find out who this guy is. There's a photo booth back at Teton's. Good chance that's where this picture's from. You want me to pick up your coat while I'm there? The one with evidence in the pocket? Please. [Clicks tongue] [Engine turns over] [Cows mooing] [ Music ] I told you it'd be a waste of time. Not a talkative crowd. Quitter. I got 20 bucks says you can't do better. You're on. Hold this. [Clears throat] Photo, please. Thank you. [ Music continues ] [Men cheering] Now that I have your attention... I know that you have all been shown this photo tonight. [Men jeering] [Laughter, cheering] So, this show is over... until I get a name, boys. Come on, boys. It's just one little name. Davis! What's his first name? That  is  his first name. Then what's his last name? Turner. [Men jeering] [Sniffs, clears throat] Pay up, bitch. Honey... I always do. [Laughs] Yeah. Mm-hmm. Let's go. [Knock on door] Hello, Mrs. Clausen. I'm Sheriff Longmire. Would you mind if I came in? I'm sorry. I... Ephraim : Rachel! It's not fitting for her to talk with strange men. [Door creaks] Mr. Clausen, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to offend you or your wife. I... I was hoping we could talk about your daughter, Hannah. She's not here. I know. I spoke to your son, Samuel. He explained. Have you spoken to him or to Hannah since they left? No. Heard any news about them from friends or neighbors? No. Mr. Clausen, I don't mean to annoy you with these questions. Why do you continue to ask them, then? 'Cause I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your daughter, Hannah... [Hammer pounding] I'm sorry to say your daughter's... dead. She was lost to me long ago. [Pounding resumes] [Sighs] Henry : Do you not have people for that? You want something done right, you do it yourself. Ruby said you had not eaten. So, you think the dead girl was in this car. Who else are you expecting to find? No idea. You have any dealings with a... Ephraim Clausen? No. Why do you ask? Well, I went out there today... told him that his daughter was dead, and no reaction. I don't know much about being a Mennonite, but I know about being a dad, and I'd be... [Sighs] Well, I'd be something. Every culture processes grief in its own way. Have you, uh... you heard that Cady's seeing someone? What? It has been like three years since she dated anyone. Who is it? Oh, okay, so she hasn't told you either, huh? [Laughs] You see, this is why I do not have kids. They make you crazy. [Chuckles] You know, she might tell you. For some reason, she likes you. The reason she likes me is I do not pry into parts of her life that are not my business. Besides, you might be better off not knowing. Branch : Good news... While we were in Oden, we caught a huge break in the case. Found your coat. We, um, also got a name off the photo-booth pictures. Davis Turner. How'd you manage that? Let's just say there was a pole involved. Davis has a record. He's got three outstanding warrants for assault. Sounds like a man we should talk to. The only problem is no one can find him. I just got off the phone with his bosses. He just started a four-day shift driving a truck for Farion Energy. I'll find him. Walt? Walt. Cyrus Brooks is here. He said you called him about his car? When I ran the registration, I was surprised to see your name pop up. [Door closes] 
 
 How is it your car ends up with a bunch of Mennonite kids? Well, truth is, I gave it to them, Sheriff. It was my old car. I thought they could use it. And there's not a whole host of people lining up to help those kids. But I don't suppose we can leave it at that? Well... seeing is believing. [Chuckles] Cyrus, I bought nails from you for 10 years. I never had you figured for Mennonite. I'm not. I left when I was 17. Had 21 bucks in my pocket and the clothes on my back. I've been in their shoes. When they get out here, I give them some direction and help them find some work, cheap place to live. And, yes, a car. Why'd you impound it, by the way? One of the residents, um, Hannah Clausen... she was found dead a few nights ago. What? Wait. Hannah? My God. Wh... um... What happened? We're still piecing that together, so... There anything you can tell me about Hannah? Well, I can tell you that her job wasn't the safest. Um... She was a dancer. An exotic dancer. You saying she was a stripper? She didn't want anyone at the house knowing, so she asked me to drive her to the club. I probably should have said no, huh? [Inhales deeply] You can still help her, Cyrus. You can help me find the person that did this. Any chance you'd be able to translate that for me? "He who is not with me is against me." It's a Bible quote. Matthew, if I'm not mistaken. What about the drawing? Mean anything to you? Yeah, it looks familiar. Sort of like the cottonwood you see along the Dark Road. Sorry? "Dark Road"? It's the road that leads straight out of Ashlan. When you go on Rumspringa, you have to walk down that road. Longest half-mile of my life. It's also the road where some of the parents secretly meet their kids at night. Isn't that against the rules? Yeah. But eternal damnation is a small price to pay to know what's going on with your kids. Most kids leave for good? Actually, no. Most of them go back home. Girls more so than boys. What was Hannah planning to do? She never said. But I got the impression she was never going back there. No. She had bigger plans. Texted one of my friends at Farion Energy, explained the situation with Davis. Managed to have his shift changed. If we leave for Oden now, we could probably catch him at home. Not you, Vic. Need you to go through those fingerprints. See if you can't compile a list of who was in that car. Are you serious? I think Oden's seen enough of you today. [Door closes] [Sighs] This is pretty standard boilerplate stuff. Nothing really worthy of me rushing over here for. Sorry, I am always suspicious when your people ask me to sign legal documents. So, Cady, you seeing anyone new? Did my dad put you up to this? No. Come on. I am just curious. Promise not to tell my dad? I promise. But why all the secrecy? It's just, well... [Clears throat] You know there's not a lot of guys in Durant. You know, not a very deep bench. So the guy that I'm seeing, he's a little older. How much older? About 120 years. He's a vampire, and he's amazing. Okay. O... okay. You should really meet him, Henry. No. Oh, but it would have to be at night. You have made your point. [Chuckles] [Sighs] Branch : This is Davis' trailer. [Dog barking] Sheriff's department! Oh! [Panting] [Grunting] [Handcuffs clicking] You should always stand to the side of the door. [Sniffs] No, no, no, no. There... there's got to be some kind of mistake. That... that can't be. I dropped Hannah off at home two nights ago before my shift. She was fine. Two nights ago. That makes you the last person to see her alive. Vic : And guess where that puts you on the suspect list? Whoa, whoa. H... hold up. I... I didn't do anything! Listen, I... I loved her. Every dime we made, we put aside to move away together. Why would I throw away something like that? She... [Sighs] Hannah was my soul mate. She was a stripper. They're paid to like you. No! She wasn't like that, all right?! Where is Hannah?! You're lying! Where is she?! Walt : You got a temper, Davis. Hannah ever see this side of you? You don't know sh1t about me. You can ask anyone. All I ever did was protect her. There are plenty of jagoffs where she worked that would hassle her, but I always put them in line. Any particular jagoff come to mind? I don't know. Two nights ago, she was arguing with this dude. He took off as soon as I walked over. Had you ever seen him before? Branch : You got off early tonight. Why didn't you go to the club after your shift? Tonight's her night off. She liked to spend those with her family. You ever meet her family? No. She was never really keen on the idea. Fact that they're Mennonites might have something to do with that. Menno-what? Mennonites. They're like the Amish. Amish? She never said nothing about being Amish. Why wouldn't she tell me something like that? I mean, I... I knew she grew up in a religious house. Hell, I've heard her quote chapter and verse by heart. Amish? Ruby? Ruby : Uh-huh? Pen. "Please." Thank you. [Drawer opens] What? My Bible. Yeah. Keep Davis locked up for his warrants till we get this settled. Also, pull Hannah's bank records. Make sure she really was saving her money. Where the hell do you think you're going? Ashlan. Why? The Bible quote from the note was code. Matthew... Chapter 12, verse 30. It's a meeting time. Hannah was supposed to meet someone on the Dark Road at 12:30. How do you know it's tonight? I don't. Davis says it's her night off. Worth a shot. [Footsteps approach] Mrs. Clausen. Uh... excuse me. What are you doing out here, Mrs. Clausen? I was supposed to meet my daughter, Hannah. Why are you here? Did your husband tell you about our conversation? [Sighs] He only said that Hannah wasn't coming home. Thank goodness. I told her to leave. When, uh... when I was her age, I didn't know there was any other choice. It's a comfort to know she won't make the same mistakes I made. Where did you get that? Why were you writing to your daughter in code? In case the note was intercepted. Ephraim would have been upset. I don't understand why  you  have it. How'd you manage to get it to her? A man in town whom we trust... Cyrus Brooks. I... I gave it to him in his shop, and he passed it along to her. Now... Please tell me why  you  have that note. I'm afraid there was an incident. Hannah was found dead two days ago. [Sobbing] [Sobbing] I shouldn't have told her to go! Why? I shouldn't have told her to go! [Sobbing] Ephraim Clausen never told his wife about Hannah's death. You, uh... You want to bring him in? Not yet. First I want to get Cyrus in for another chat. Apparently he's been passing notes between Hannah and her mother and didn't think to mention it. If you think  that's  weird, Hannah  was  saving her money. She had $16,000 stashed in a joint savings account. A joint account? With Davis? With Cyrus. Cyrus said Hannah had big plans. Maybe those plans involved him. If he got wind she was leaving with Davis, he could have gotten upset, confronted her at work. Any of those prints belong to Cyrus, Vic? For a guy who says he gave his car away, he sure as hell drives it a lot. Let's bring him in. Mind explaining why you have a joint bank account with the victim? Hannah's parents didn't want to get her a social-security number. The bank wouldn't open an account without one, so I helped. You do this for  all  the kids or just the pretty ones? I never touched her. And if you look at the statement, you'll see I never touched a penny she made, either. Why didn't you tell me about the note? I translated it, didn't I? You didn't tell me who it was from. How was I supposed to know that? You passed the note to Hannah. I gave Hannah a plain envelope. I had no idea what was inside. I didn't consider it any of my business. [Dog barks in distance] Thanks. Clears up a lot. I need you to look at someone before you go. Cyrus : I don't know him. Is he the one who killed Hannah? I can't comment on an ongoing investigation. Is that all you're gonna ask him? What about his relationship with Hannah? Davis, is that the man you saw Hannah fighting with at the club? No. I never seen him before. Here. Make sure you're positive. Sorry. It wasn't him. Look again. Wait. What if I recognize someone else? [Telephone ringing] Excuse me. It is a beautiful day at the Red Pony, and continual soirée. This is Henry. Walt : Hey, Henry. Got a young kid in there who looks like Opie? [Indistinct conversations] Looks like he just ordered a beer he with anyone? No. Do me a favor. Don't serve him. Why? Is he the guy dating Cady? If you need a reason, he's underage. [Sniffs] [Engine turns over] [ Music ] [Music stops, engine shuts off] Samuel. If I remember correctly, you dot have a license. Sheriff, I, uh... There was no one at the house to drive me, and I... I just... I needed to, uh... Relax, son. I understand you've had a lot going on lately. I'll let it slide this time. Thank you. But I can't let you drive without a license. Let me take you home. How long did you know your sister was stripping? I don't know what you're talking about. I know you saw your sister that night. I got a witness, I.D.'d you arguing with her at the strip club. Y... you missed the turnoff. Where are we going? You're a minor. I can't legally release you to anyone except your parents. Take a nice ride out to Ashlan, get everything settled. I told you, I can't... I can't go home. Why? Wouldn't have anything to do with your father, would it? You're afraid of him, aren't you, Samuel? You tell your father what Hannah was really up to? Did you find a way to let him know she was stripping? Samuel! [Engine revs] [Distorted shouting] Hannah : Just stop! Oh! Hannah! Hannah! [Sobs] [Engine shuts off] [Sobbing] It was an accident, Sheriff. I had to bring her home. I had to. Why, Samuel? Because it was my duty! I didn't even want to come on Rumspringa, but my father made me! "Samuel, she is your only sister and my only daughter. You come back with her, or you don't come back at all." [Sobs] I didn't mean to hurt her. I just wanted the both of us to go back home. And now neither of us ever can. [Sobs] W... where am I going to go? What am I gonna do? [Sniffles] Son... You're gonna take my hand. Henry... You can't tell Cady about this. None of it. That is your choice. But I can tell you from experience, Walt... secrets like this can tear families apart. [Dog barking in distance] [Dialing] [Cellphone ringing] [Sighs] I should get that. It could be an emergency. [Ringing continues] [Beep] Hello? Hey, Punk. Dad. It's late. Are you... are you all right? Is everything okay? I'm fine. I... I... I just wanted to apologize for the other morning. I, uh... I didn't mean to pry. Sometimes it's hard for me to remember that you have your own life. Anyway, I... I just wanted to say that, um, I'd love to meet your... your new guy. Um, but only when you want me to, so... Thanks, dad. Uh, in the meantime, how's, uh, lunch tomorrow sound? Walt : Busy Bee? Sounds good. I'll call you. Oh, uh, Cady? Yeah? I love you. I love you, too. [Beep] So, you want me to go? [Sighs]
