 Previously on  American Gothic... 
 You think if you come clean, you get the girl back. 
 Christina : Last chance. 
 Bye. 
 Alison : Jennifer Windham strikes again. 
 Where is this woman getting all these stories? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Alison :  For sleeping with my husband? 
 Or for illegally bugging us? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 That's the killer getting back in the car. 
 That's the passenger door. 
 Someone else is driving. 
 Jack, tell me right now. Where did you get this? 
 Jack :  Uncle Garrett's cabin. 
 Alison :  I want to toast  my big brother. 
 To family. 
 You know what they say. 
 When you arrest an innocent person, they freak out. 
 They're yelling, pacing, and never sit still. 
 But when you arrest someone who's guilty, they go to sleep. 
 You've heard that, haven't you? 
 Funny thing... is that when we brought you in and we put you in that cell, you lay awake all night. 
 Perfectly still. 
 But you never slept. 
 I don't believe you did any of the actual killing. 
 I think it was all your dad. 
 Garrett, look. 
 If you're willing to come clean, tell the entire truth about your role in the Silver Bells killings, that would be an incredible showing of good faith. 
 But if you don't cooperate, Garrett, we have the knife. 
 Your knife. 
 The bit of ivory that was found at the site of the first Silver Bells killing matches exactly the piece missing from the knife. 
 Your knife. 
 We know, absolutely, that you're involved. 
 Just answer the question. 
 Madeline :  Garrett. 
 What did you do? 
 How you feeling? 
 Fine. 
 No problems with the guards or other... people? 
 The other prisoners? 
 No. No problem. 
 Have the police questioned you? 
 (sighs) Yeah, a little. 
 And you didn't say anything? 
 No, not yet. 
 Not ever. 
 (sighs) 
 Now, I've put a call in to Darcy Campano. 
 She's brilliant. I've hired her to defend you. 
 Save your money. 
 Save it. 
 You love your money. 
 She's the best criminal defense attorney in the city, worth every p... 
 Stop! 
 Stop. 
 It's over. 
 All of this was inevitable. 
 We just postponed it 14 years. 
 That's all. 
 It was nice, though. 
 It was. 
 Being back in the fold. 
 Part of... Part of the family again. 
 That's not over. 
 I think it is. 
 No. Listen to me. 
 I've been thinking about that knife, and I seem to remember that your father gave it to you. 
 Do you remember that? 
 Do you? 
 Yeah, I remember a lot of things. 
 Some more vividly than others. 
 (cell door closes) 
 Darcy :  You're the best guy in the world. 
 That's the story I'll sell to everybody. 
 Because the only real evidence they've got is the knife from your cabin. 
 And there is an ocean of time between when that ivory chip fell out of the handle and when they got the knife. 
 I will rip them to shreds over this. 
 And I understand from your mother that it wasn't even your knife. 
 Your dad gave it to you. 
 He must have had it on him during a murder, left the ivory chip behind, then gave it to his nature-loving oldest son, and that was that. 
 You're just an innocent bystander with an unlucky genealogy. 
 Have you ever read the writings of Horace Mann? 
 What? 
 "If evil is inevitable, how are the wicked accountable?" 
 "Why do we call men wicked at all?" 
 "Evil is inevitable..." 
 "...but it is also remediable." 
 Also remediable. 
 Do you believe that? 
 Wh... I'm sure you're a little freaked out in here. 
 That's understandable. 
 I mean, it's jail, for God's sakes. 
 It's a shock to the system. 
 No one ever expects to wind up here. 
 Well, actually, I kind of did. 
 I need you to just sit tight and keep quiet. 
 Don't tell anybody anything. 
 Don't even tell me anything. 
 Nothing. 
 You think you can do that? 
 Of course you can. 
 Are you sleeping okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I can sleep anywhere.

 You mind telling me why you're breaking into my cabin? 
 And just what are you hoping to steal? 
 Nothing! 
 I-I wasn't going to steal anything. 
 I swear. 
 I just, I just need a warm place to stay. 
 How long you been out here? 
 A while. 
 Just sleeping in the woods? 
 No, I-I've been couch surfing. 
 The hell does that mean? 
 A lot of the cabins are empty, so I've just been... 
 Breaking in and sleeping in people's cabins. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 And eating their food? 
 Maybe a few times. 
 (chuckles) Where you come from? 
 Boston. 
 You're telling me you came out here from Boston with no cabin, no food, and no plan? 
 I thought I could figure it out. 
 I've been up here before. 
 Okay, Daniel Boone. 
 About eight miles that way is a road that gets you back to the highway. 
 You can thumb a ride back to Boston. Now start walking. 
 No, I'm not going back. 
 I ain't asking you, son, I'm telling you get the hell out of here. 
 I'm not going back there! 
 How come? 
 I... couldn't take the people. 
 (laughs) Well, that makes two of us. 
 I don't care where you go. 
 But you got to go. 
 And if I catch you back around my place again... 
 I know... you won't miss next time. 
 I didn't miss this time. 
 Daniel Boone. 
 Where's your canteen? 
 So you won't die of thirst. 
 There's a call for you. 
 Come on, you can take it out here. 
 Hello. 
 How's jail? 
 They treating you all right? 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 How's rehab? 
 It's great. You know, there's some group time, some alone time... it's cool. 
 Visitors? 
 Yeah, you know, the fam. 
 Hey, too bad jail isn't closer to rehab, they'd only have to park once. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 Cam, I want to apologize to you. 
 What? 
 You were doing me a favor, going to talk to Christina, when you got the drugs... 
 Hey, look. 
 I mean, you must be feeling a lot of guilt over... 
 I-I don't know and I don't want to know, but as far as me using's concerned, you can let yourself off the hook for that. 
 I mean, I earned my place in here all by myself. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 That goes back a long time. 
 I wish I'd been there for more of that. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm sorry for that, as well. 
 Hey, man, look. I'm the one's supposed to be making the amends here. 
 Listen... 
 I want you to know something. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 I'm in rehab for the fifth time. 
 No, no. 
 Not the drugs. Not that. But... you stayed true to yourself. 
 I mean, you could have been a... 
 A spoiled, preppy little jackass. 
 But-but you're not. You're an artist. 
 You made a-a career out of being smart and subversive. And... 
 I am so proud of you. 
 Why are you being all wise and philosophical? 
 Oh, you know. 
 Just getting it all out before I go to the electric chair. 
 (chuckles) 
 I've been thinking about a lot of different things. 
 Honesty. 
 Transparency. 
 Somehow, it's-it's liberating. 
 Maybe I'm finding a whole new way of living again.

 Is this what you were after? 
 This is good. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, uh, you're not still mad at me for trying to break into your place? 
 Well, you didn't actually break in. 
 And the fact that you've been out here for a year, all alone... 
 I get it. 
 Most people probably wouldn't. 
 But I do. 
 Do you, uh, live out here all the time? 
 No. 
 I only come out for about a month. 
 Always around this time. 
 So I may see you once a year. 
 If that feels too often, we can cut it back to every other year. 
 (owl hooting) 
 I can show you how to catch a rabbit, if you want. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 I'd-I'd really appreciate that. 
 Ah, don't be gooey about it. 
 It ain't no big deal. 
 Okay. 
 Ollie Westcott died. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Was he a friend of yours? 
 (laughing): No. That old b*st*rd didn't have any friends. 
 But he also didn't have any relatives. 
 There won't be no one coming up here to claim his cabin. 
 I'll show you where it is tomorrow.

 Me, too. 
 Usually, city folks are a little squeamish about the killing part. 
 You used to go hunting with your dad? 
 A few times. 
 Alison :  You and Dad working together? 
 I don't think so. 
 Remember the time the two of you tried to fix the garage door? 
 (laughs) I thought you were gonna have a fistfight. 
 So I just don't buy this whole "Garrett is the accomplice" theory. 
 So, before, when you thought the Silver Bells Killer might be just me... 
 Water under the bridge? 
 So, well, I just... 
 (sighs) 
 I just came by to tell you that, um... 
 I'm on your side. 
 Thank you. 
 Is there anything I can do for you? 
 No. 
 Well, if you think of something, you let me know. 
 I'll let you know. 
 I'm okay. 
 I've, um, I've-I've got to go. 
 You got a speech to make somewhere? 
 No. I'm... meeting with an employee. 
 Jennifer :  I am a top-notch reporter. 
 My potential is limitless. 
 Many people look up to me. 
 Alison : And if I don't do exactly as Alison says, I'll end up in jail. 
 You know, you probably should start locking your door. 
 The lock's broken. The super's on it. 
 What do you want? 
 I need you to get me something on Conley. 
 What? By some miracle, I seem to only be trailing him by seven points. 
 Striking distance. 
 And I now have a delightful secret weapon in you. 
 You're shameless, morally ambiguous, but with the appearance of objectivity. 
 You're the whole package, Jen. 
 I want you to take him down. 
 He's the mayor. 
 How am I supposed to get any...? 
 You figured out how to put an illegal listening device in my mother's house. 
 Dig deep. 
 Take his housekeeper out for coffee. 
 Follow him. 
 Just get me something I can use. 
 Or you can start doing those daily affirmations from your cell. 
 Time for dinner.

 The rabbit's cooked perfectly. 
 Need a new knife. 
 Just needs sharpening is all. 
 Why are you so attached to that thing? 
 Sentimental value? 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 You never talk about your family. 
 Neither do you. 
 They're all dead. 
 Your turn. 
 They're all dead. 
 (chuckles) 
 We're just not very close is all. 
 Well, I was with my little sister. 
 Tessa. 
 I had a niece named Julie. 
 (chuckles) 
 It was kind of the same thing, you know? 
 My family... they were fine, I guess, but Julie? 
 She was a good egg. 
 She played the oboe. 
 (laughs) 
 I mean, you can find people all over who play the piano or the guitar, but the oboe... that's rare. 
 (chuckles) 
 After college, I think she could've played in any orchestra through the whole damn country. 
 New York, Philadelphia, Boston, you name it. 
 So what happened? 
 Car wreck. 
 Drunk driver. 
 Middle of the day, drunk out of his mind. 
 I've lost all the members of my family through the years. 
 I hardly even think of 'em. 
 But Julie... 
 I think about her a lot. 
 If I could see her just one more time... 
 But I can't. 
 That's that. 
 You miss Tessa? 
 We used to come up here in the summers, camping. 
 That's how I know the area so well. 
 I still go back and... check if they're there, sometimes. 
 That must've been rich people camping. 
 (laughs) 'Cause when I met you, you didn't know a damn thing. 
 Oh, yeah. Big lake house, five bedrooms, three bath. 
 Yeah, that's camping like grocery shopping is hunting. 
 (both laughing) 
 (coughing) 
 Well... here's to family. 
 The ones we like, anyway. 
 You know what I just realized? 
 Someone could've planted that knife in his old cabin to frame him. 
 I mean, think about it. 
 Right? 
 The real killer could've seen Garrett's face on the television a few weeks ago when the police were hunting him down, saw an opportunity, found out where he lived in Maine, and... 
 Tess, stop. 
 Okay? Just stop. 
 This loyalty to him, I... 
 I understand. 
 And, in a way, it is very touching. 
 But, Tess, at some point, you have to face the reality of what's going on. 
 You were sure... Everybody was sure... 
 That the DNA would match him. It didn't. 
 Why don't you go down there and ask him? 
 Point-blank. 
 What? 
 Go down to the jail, look him in the eye and ask him if he was involved. 
 You would know if he's telling the truth more than anyone, right? 
 You want me to do your bidding? 
 You want to use me against my brother? 
 No, that's not what I'm saying. You do. 
 Our goal is the same here, don't you get that? 
 I'm not the enemy. 
 We both want the truth. 
 Don't you need to know for yourself?

 Hey. 
 Hey.

 You were right. 
 What do you mean? 
 I've been naive. 
 In denial. 
 Garrett put this beside my bed the night that he left. 
 I know you've been re-canvassing the neighborhoods where the murders happened. 
 Looking for witnesses. 
 Somebody who maybe saw something without realizing it. 
 This was taken at the height of the panic. 
 Maybe it'll jog somebody's memory. 
 I'll do anything I can to help. 
 Brady : You know, when you're canvassing the crime scene and you ask people, "Did you see anybody?", a lot of the time it's hard for them to remember. 
 But when you can hold up a photograph and say, "Did you see this guy?", well, sometimes that jogs the memory. 
 I like you. 
 What? 
 I like you. 
 I do. 
 I think you're a good person. 
 I think you're good for my sister. 
 So I'm happy. 
 Happy that she married a good cop. 
 And congrats on the baby. 
 That's really great. 
 I don't know what kind of bizarre mind games you're trying to play with me... 
 I'm not. 
 But here's what you need to understand... 
 She believed in you. 
 She defended you. 
 And now you lost even her, Garrett. 
 Your last true supporter in the world. 
 So if the D.A. comes at you with any kind of a deal, you take it. 
 Because we're re-canvassing. 
 And we will find a witness. 
 Because somewhere along the line, you slipped up. 
 There is no way you could've done everything that you did without being seen. 
 Nobody saw you? 
 Man, you've got some creep to you. 
 So, how was it? 
 Was great. 
 My little sister's all grown up. 
 Tessa, she's... she's got a boyfriend. 
 And my other sister Alison, she's out here. 
 She's pregnant. 
 Uh, my little brother is, he's married. 
 With a kid.

 My little brother's got a kid. 
 I'm an uncle. 
 That's how that works.

 I'm the oldest, so I-I always thought it would be me. 
 Getting married first and having kids. 
 Well, maybe somebody will come along for you. 
 That's not in the cards for me anymore. 
 Listen.

 You never knew you were gonna spend all these years out here in the woods eating rabbits with me.

 Pretty far along, too.

 Uh... 
 If I tell you, then-then that's covered by the lawyer/client privilege thing, right? 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna be a father. 
 Garrett's lawyer has been in there all day. 
 She's been taking meticulous inventory of the evidence. 
 Trying to get him off on a technicality. 
 She's been intent on independently testing everything. 
 Dana? 
 This is unnecessary. 
 I never make mistakes. 
 Speaking in absolutes is a mistake. 
 (scoffs) Fine. 
 You want to waste your time, waste your time. 
 Find anything on the cuff link from the David Morales crime scene? 
 I never processed a cuff link. 
 Because it vanished before you got the chance. 
 Well, it's probably just been misplaced. 
 It's gonna turn up. 
 Or not. It doesn't matter. 
 I now have proof this department doesn't track evidence correctly. 
 Things are getting lost. 
 Maybe mislabeled, maybe on purpose. 
 It'll be a full-scale police conspiracy before I finish my opening statement. 
 Apparently Darcy Campano already has something. 
 So she's taking care of everything on the legal side to get me out. 
 What I need you to do is... whatever inside political thing that you do. 
 Wow, this place got to you in a hurry. 
 Yeah, sure, b-but, Ali, can you help me? 
 Sure, I'll meet with the D.A. and see if there's anything I can do...

 Tune in for our special report tonight at 5:00.

 Okay, here we go.

 Hello, I'm Jennifer Windham. 
 And I do have new information in the Silver Bells case. 
 I've been told to read the following, "The police believe the Silver Bells Killer had an accomplice. He did. It was me. And I would've stayed quiet, but you wouldn't leave well enough alone. You kept digging. And now I'm back. But if you forget about me, I will forget about all of you. Continue to pursue me and people will die." 
 No! No! You're... 
 Anchor : Jennifer. 
 Uh, Jennifer? 
 I'm not sure what we just witnessed. 
 And, my God, it appears that, uh, our correspondent Jennifer Windham was assaulted, uh, perhaps fatally. 
 Guard :  Well, I apologize. 
 I thought you were a killer. 
 Madeline :  Garrett? 
 What did you do? 
 He tried to kill me.
