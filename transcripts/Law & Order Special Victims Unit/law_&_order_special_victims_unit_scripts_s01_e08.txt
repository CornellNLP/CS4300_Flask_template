 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 What are they? 
 Those are birdwatchers. 
 There's a lot of them in this part of the park. 
 Boring. 
 You get to sit down. 
 Grandpa, that's no fun. 
 This is! 
 I'll get it, Grandpa! 
 No. I don't want you going off the path by yourself. 
 Did you find it? 
 I'll buy you a new one. 
 Carlyle, Homicide. 
 Stabler, Special Victims. 
 My partner, Benson. 
 Who's the brass? 
 Honcho, One Police Plaza. 
 Said he wants the perp arrested yesterday. 
 He should talk to HG Wells. 
 Why the pressure? 
 The vic was an ADA named Karen Fitzgerald. 
 Found dead in the bushes late this afternoon... raped, shot in the head. 
 I know her... 
 I knew her. 
 She's my age. We had drinks together a few times after court. 
 It's all yours. 
 CSU can tell you what they've got so far. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x08 Stalked 
 Original air date : 1999/11/22 
 I just got off the phone with the mayor's aide. 
 He wants a suspect in this Fitzgerald rape/homicide ASAP. 
 So where are we with this? 
 She'd been an ADA for two years. 
 100 percenter. 
 She took on every case that was thrown at her. 
 Didn't care if it lowered her win/lose average. 
 You knew her? 
 We were acquaintances. 
 I wish we'd been friends. 
 She kept her head down and tried to put the bad guys in jail. 
 Which meant a lot of them walked. 
 Most of them didn't, but we're still talking about a dumptruck full of perps... people with a grudge. 
 Anything at the crime scene to indicate she might've known the killer? 
 A lot of anger. 
 The guy beat her with a rock, raped her, and then took the time out of his busy schedule to shoot her... twice. 
 Anybody remember the Labor Day rapist? 
 He raped someone on Labor Day? 
 There were probably 10 rapes on Labor Day, John. 
 The papers picked up on this one, put their collectively creative heads together and came up with that moniker for the doer. 
 Anyway, it went down in the Ramble like this one. 
 No homicide, but a beating, same time of day. 
 It's still open. 
 You're saying same perp then. 
 We've only been partners a few months, but the man is starting to think like me, only slower. 
 Jeffries, Briscoe, break out the Labor Day files, see what was missed. 
 I'd like to grab someone from Forensics, rewalk the crime scene with Benson, get a feel for what went down. 
 You got it. 
 Munch, Cassidy draw parallels between Labor Day and yesterday, then see if we got a rape that fell between the two with the same M.O. 
 Central Park The Ramble Friday, November 12 
 We're assuming she was grabbed and then hustled into the bushes over here. 
 What are the round casts? 
 Knees. 
 See the hand prints in front of them? 
 Perp made her crawl? 
 We got... no hand prints in front of these knees. 
 What do you make of that? 
 She was begging. 
 Begging not to be raped or for her life? 
 Both. 
 So the perp picked up a rock... we've got that at the lab with her blood on it... broke her nose. 
 She was gushing blood. 
 We found it on her clothes, on the ground here. 
 Also found the condom wrapper. 
 So she's crawling away with a broken nose, raped, begging for her life. 
 Then the guy shoots her twice. 
 We got spent rounds from a .44. 
 One went into her left eye, lodged into the ground here. 
 The other one took off part of her head, and then ricocheted up there. 
 Did you find a book? 
 No. Why? 
 Her secretary said she liked to come to the Ramble to read on her lunch hour... because it's so safe and serene. 
 No book. 
 What if she was dragged from this side? 
 I need gloves. 
 "A Burnt Out Case." Murder mystery? 
 I guess we screwed up. 
 No, you didn't. 
 Okay, so, let's just say that she was dragged from this side. 
 That means she was... 
 Grabbed from this side. 
 Probably off that bench. 
 Hey, hey! I'm losing the Warbling Vireo, lady. 
 Benson... police department. 
 We'd like to ask you some questions. 
 The guy almost pushes me off the bench. 
 What time was that? 
 I don't know, 3:30, 4:00. 
 I'd just spotted an Eastern WoodPewee. 
 Did he say anything? 
 No. 
 Did you? 
 I'm not comfortable talking to people. 
 That's why I watch birds. 
 I like being alone. 
 Okay. 
 What are you... what's this? 
 There are 20,000 known s*x offenders in our computer. 
 I've narrowed it down from the description you gave. 
 So holler if you see anything, okay? 
 I'd be better at this if these guys had feathers. 
 Use your binoculars. 
 That's him! 
 Upper left hand corner. 
 Off the first six. Are you sure? 
 Pretty sure. 
 Nah. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna print him out. 
 Why don't we take a look at a few more, all right? 
 No, none of those guys. 
 Wait! 
 No. 
 Any of these? 
 That's him. 
 Lower righthand corner. 
 So the first guy isn't the guy? 
 Well, they both look like the guy. 
 If I'm not doing this right, you can get someone else. 
 You're our witness. 
 We need you. 
 Can I have a Coke or something? 
 A Pepsi, Sprite. 
 Give me a Pepsi. 
 10 ID's. 
 Birdman ID'd 10 people. 
 Larry Bird and The Partridge Family. 
 What's this? 
 I had the prosecutor's office cross reference the bird watcher's ID's with all of Fitzgerald's cases. 
 They made two hits. 
 One of the first, Kenneth Maggio. 
 He was convicted of forcible sodomy. 
 Did time in Elmira, he's out on parole. 
 And we're gonna bang at Mr. Richard White, another Fitzgerald case. 
 Where does he land on the atrocity bell curve? 
 Date rape. Copped a plea, did no time, he's a realtor. 
 I was shocked to read about it in the paper. 
 Why? 
 Nobody deserves to die that way. 
 I actually felt for the woman. 
 Felt what? 
 Happy that the woman who prosecuted you on a date rape charge wouldn't have the occasion to prosecute you in the future? 
 Those charges were reduced to sexual assault. 
 I pled guilty on my lawyer's advice. 
 "A lot of gray area in a 'he said/she said,"' he said. 
 I was innocent. 
 So you were railroaded? 
 And her death made you feel some kind of angst? 
 I tend to take an objective view of things. 
 Fitzgerald was doing her job. 
 She was wrong. 
 I had no hard feelings. 
 She was doing what she was hired to do. 
 I forgive her. 
 Do you forgive Louise Billings, too? 
 The person who accused you of the date rape. 
 Louise was confused, she didn't know how the world worked. 
 Please, enlighten us. 
 She had invited me to dinner a month after we broke it off. 
 One thing led to another and we had s*x. 
 Louise thought it meant more than it did. 
 She got angry and filed charges. 
 Sounds like everyone involved was wrong but you. 
 It happens. 
 Where were you yesterday between the hours of 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.? 
 Astoria. I was previewing a house. 
 Your story for yesterday, can you confirm that? 
 Yes. I was the only realtor out at the property. 
 I had to use the lockbox to get in. 
 That information is faxed to the listing agent, who would be... 
 Krim Properties in Jamaica. 
 Can anyone else corroborate your alibi? 
 Yes, my business partner, Kimberly Phillips. 
 She knows where I was. 
 Mr. Levin? 
 You spoke to a patrolman earlier? 
 Yes. I told him I'd help after I'd finished my studies in the Kollel. 
 This is about Labor Day? 
 The man I saw running in the park? 
 You want me to look at pictures? 
 That's why we're here. 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. 
 Detective Munch, it's been two hours. 
 Must I keep looking at these? 
 It would be a mitzvah. 
 Are you? 
 Why don't you do 12 more. 
 For the 12 tribes. 
 You are, aren't you? 
 Okay. 12 more. 
 Him! 
 That's the putz who ran into me and called me a Jew b*st*rd on Labor Day. 
 You're sure? 
 These things, you don't forget. 
 Jean Dussault. Canadian. Deported. 
 Cassidy, put a call into Canada and see if this guy's registered. 
 Anyone know the area code for Montreal? 
 I've got to start walking back to Riverdale. 
 Walking? I'll put you in a squad car. 
 Shabbas starts in 10 minutes. 
 I can't be in a car. 
 God protects when you observe. 
 The Jews have kept the Sabbath, and the Sabbath has kept the Jews. 
 And the police will drive you home. 
 I'm not going to let you walk to Riverdale. 
 Even with God's help, you're not gonna make it through the South Bronx. 
 Farstey? 
 Farstey. 
 Krim Properties Jamaica, Queens Friday, November 12 
 Whoever invented lockboxes, I love him. 
 We hang one of these on a house we're listing, and any agent with a license can get inside without us being there. 
 Do you have a fax for yesterday coming from your property at Newton and 28th Street? 
 I should have. 
 Do you do much business with a Richard White? 
 Stabler. 
 Quite a bit. 
 We specialize in low income housing, White Phillips attract low income buyers. 
 I don't know why they're based in Manhattan. 
 Probably gives their clients an uptown feel before they buy a shell of a fixer upper. 
 Okay. Thanks Money pits, I love 'em. 
 White's alibi checked for Labor Day. 
 Richard White was at that property at 4:00 p.m. Yesterday. 
 Is he in some kind of trouble? 
 Is selling money pits a crime? 
 Munch, I got him. 
 The Labor Day rapist. 
 Oh, you got him? 
 What are you the Lone Ranger now? 
 Okay. We got him. 
 I called Forensics. 
 They'd never matched the pubic hairs found on the Labor Day vic to anyone. 
 So I gave them Dussault. 
 The DNA and his hair showed up on a prior record... bingo. 
 And where is he now? 
 I spoke to Canada. 
 They're looking for him. 
 That's great. While Dudley DoRight's out searching the 10 provinces... that's about four million square miles... 
 Dussault could've come back and done Fitzgerald. 
 He's still a suspect. 
 Yeah, Go ahead, Munch. rain on my parade. 
 I don't just want to rain on your parade, I want to blow up all the floats. 
 Where are we going? 
 Lower East Side. 
 I spoke to Kenneth Maggio's PO. 
 The sodomite, he works in a donut shop there. 
 Tong's Donuts 87 Delancy Street Friday, November 12 
 You got a Kenneth Maggio working for you? 
 Maggio? Oh, the crook! 
 Works minimum wage. 
 He's baking in the back. 
 These safe to eat? 
 Best in town. 
 I'm not sure if that's a yes. 
 Police. Looking for Kenneth Maggio. 
 He committed sodomy. 
 You trying to ruin my rep? 
 You beat us to that one. 
 Doesn't look like you're gonna get that pastry chef job at Boulet Bakery. 
 Would you look at this. 
 What a cliche. 
 He shaves his head to try to make himself look different. 
 He just makes himself look more and more ugly. 
 What's next, huh? 
 Fake glasses, fake nose? 
 Does this turn you on? 
 What do you want? 
 Isn't it a little dangerous for you to be around all these helpless donuts? 
 Come on. What do you want? 
 Your alibi yesterday, 3:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m.? 
 Home, I was home. 
 You're not lying to us, are you? 
 'Cause that would be bad, very bad. 
 You'd better talk to us, 'cause we're looking to you for rape/homicide. 
 Right now. 
 Fitzgerald? 
 Yeah. 
 The bitch who prosecuted me. 
 Hey, hey, you can't pin that one on me. 
 I was with my lover. 
 A guy named Frank Stern. 
 Lives on Jane Street. 
 You're saying you went over to the dark side? 
 The love that dare not speak its name? How convenient. 
 Too gay to rape a DA, huh? 
 You wanna know why? 
 I'll show you why, huh? 
 Here. See?! See?! 
 They gave me a welcome bath at Elmira. 
 Soap and sulfuric acid. 
 I can't even rape a freaking ant. 
 Guys, check this out. 
 Teddy Kennedy lands in the water at Chappaquiddick on July 18th. 
 Neil Armstrong lands on the moon July 20th. Think about that. 
 And? 
 You don't find that amazing? 
 Nope. 
 You're learning, Jeffries. 
 Hey, Munch, What's up with your donut store guy? 
 Let's put it this way, the guy will never be accused of a crime involving penile penetration. 
 Wanna know why? 
 Yeah, why? 
 Acid on the scrotum. 
 Does anybody look good for Labor Day? 
 Yeah. Cassidy helped Forensics nail a guy named Jean Dussault, who was deported to Canada. 
 Only Canada can't find him, so... they've got the dog sleds out looking for him now. 
 Keep on him, because Dussault's Labor Day MO. 
 Is very similar to the Fitzgerald rape, okay? 
 Now, your guy, what's his name? 
 Richard White. 
 Yeah, him. 
 Where does he sit now? 
 His alibi looks good for Fitzgerald. 
 But I went through the White trial transcript. 
 Fitzgerald lets him plea down midway through the trial. 
 But not before just dragging his ass through the mud. 
 He had to have hated her. 
 All right. 
 John, I want you to talk to the date rape victim, Louise Billings. 
 And Jeffries got a hold of Fitzgerald's best friend, an attorney. 
 Joan Simon. 
 She's coming in this afternoon. 
 All right, you should get some background there, too. 
 Let's get 'em. 
 Apartment of Louise Billings 121 West 74th Street Saturday, November 13 
 Richard could be a really sweet man, but sometimes he'd get abusive. 
 He'd push me around, make me do things... sexually, that I really didn't want to do. 
 Like Mr. Jekyll and Dr. Hyde. 
 I started losing weight from the tension. 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 I broke it off after three years. 
 How did he react to that? 
 He was calm. 
 He said he understood. 
 And how did he react to that? 
 I kept on bumping into him. 
 We'd make a little small talk, and then he'd move on. 
 It was more like talking to an old friend rather than a lover. 
 How often did you run into him? 
 I don't know. 
 Two, three times a month. 
 Didn't you think all these meetings were odd? 
 In a city this size, you accidentally crossed paths how often? 
 My shrink says it was a classic case of cognitive dissonance. 
 So... we ran into each other again. 
 Well, Richard was in a particularly charming mood. 
 I invited him up to my place for dinner... for old time's sake. 
 He got drunk. 
 And then I was looking at Mr. Hyde. 
 He grabbed me and threw me down, and he told me to crawl to him and beg for forgiveness. 
 And I did. 
 Probably saved your life. 
 And it wasn't weak to get the courage to face him in court. 
 Karen Fitzgerald gave me the strength to do that. 
 And after it was all over... do you know what Richard did? 
 He sent me flowers with a note that said, "No hard feelings." 
 How long did you know Karen? 
 Since law school. 
 We were very close. 
 They don't teach you self defense in the New York law books. 
 Did she ever say she was afraid of anyone? 
 Never. 
 She was fearless. 
 Not trusting, not naive. 
 Fearless. 
 We'd go out to eat and guys would hit on us. 
 She'd flash her ADA's ID badge at them and they'd disappear. 
 Can you think of any incident, regardless of whether or not you think it's relevant? 
 About a month ago we were having lunch, and there was a guy sitting across from us. 
 He was smiling, staring. 
 I pointed him out to Karen and she got rattled. 
 Instead of doing her ID thing, she said that we should leave. 
 Did she say why? 
 No. 
 I asked her about it a few weeks later and she still said nothing. 
 Do you see him on this page? 
 That's him. 
 White sends flowers to one vic, smiles at another vic in a restaurant, they get rattled. 
 What's your point? 
 He's stalking her. 
 Impossible. We don't have a stalking statute in New York. 
 Ergo there's no way to stalk anyone. 
 An Assistant DA's murder... maybe they'll change the statute. 
 I got White's trial transcript from Jeffries. 
 His partner, Phillips, was a character witness. 
 Now she's corroborating his alibi for the Fitzgerald rape. 
 She might be the weak link. 
 If you were clean, why would you stay partners with garbage like White? 
 Maybe she's afraid. 
 Maybe. 
 See if that's what she says. 
 1202 Newton Avenue Astoria, Queens Saturday, November 13 
 Ms. Phillips? 
 Is this the house Mr. White was at 4:00 p.m. Thursday? 
 Yeah, it's all in the broker's report. 
 I'm sorry, say that again? 
 It's all in the broker's report. 
 Here, I'll show you. 
 When I get the key, it makes a record of my visit. 
 So now all of your information is being sent to Krim Properties? 
 That's how it works. 
 How well do you know Richard White? 
 Well enough. 
 I mean, he's my business partner after all. 
 For how long? 
 Two years. 
 I met Richard when we were at an open house. 
 He proposed that we start our own company and said that he'd provide the seed money. 
 Just like that? 
 We'd been talking about the big realty companies eating up our commissions. 
 So you basically went into business with a complete stranger? 
 Well, actually, I said no. 
 I thought he was a little odd. 
 I kind of blew him off initially. 
 What turned you around? 
 He did a really sweet thing. 
 He sent me flowers with a card that said his feelings weren't hurt, or something like that. 
 He's persistent. 
 That's what it takes in real estate. 
 We kept running into each other at these open houses, you know, he'd pitched the idea to me... and after awhile it started sounding good, so I said, "Why not?" 
 And you've done well together. 
 Yeah, very. 
 Oh, I have a closing in about a half an hour. 
 Does that answer your questions? 
 Yeah. 
 If we need anything else, we'll just give you a call. 
 Okay. 
 Great. Thank you. 
 Yeah, bye. 
 Well, she's holding out. 
 I'm getting that, too. 
 So tell me why. 
 White's a suspect in a rape/homicide investigation. 
 I would be afraid to talk about him too, if I were her. 
 But if he's threatening her, she could always come to us. 
 Why cover for the guy? 
 Why did Louise Billings let him into her apartment? 
 He controls. 
 Somehow, he controls. 
 I know you're fixed on White, but let's not forget Dussault is still a question mark. 
 Munch, Cassidy and Canada are dealing with Dussault, we're hanging on to White until we have reason not to. 
 Fine. 
 Assuming White's our guy, you think Phillips knows what he did? 
 No. 
 But I think that he's got something on her. 
 Enough to make her do what he asks. 
 You check her for priors? 
 Yeah. Zero. 
 I understand this guy, Don. 
 He hates women who take control. 
 He always finds some way of getting it back. 
 Louise Billings took control by breaking it off with him. 
 White raped her to control her. 
 It's the same thing with Fitzgerald. 
 She took control by prosecuting him, disparaging his reputation in the courtroom. 
 We know what he did to get control back from her. 
 So... bring him in and talk to him. 
 What if he won't come in voluntarily? 
 It sounds to me like he would enjoy taking you on. 
 But if he won't come nicely, I'll bootstrap a warrant for a parole violation. 
 What was it like before you became a detective? 
 What was what like? 
 I mean, did you wear a uniform? 
 You're still wearing one now, although... 
 Come on. We're not here to talk about me. 
 I get it. "Enough about me. 
 What do you think about me?" 
 Right. 
 For openers, your alibi for Fitzgerald is shredding. 
 Yeah, the lockbox... 
 It seems that anybody could've used it if they had your code. 
 You didn't have to be there. 
 But I was. 
 See, this is what's weird, 'cause your partner says you weren't. 
 She wasn't telling the truth. 
 How can you be so sure? 
 Because you're not. 
 You dress down, but you're very attractive. 
 Is this some of you're famous charm, White? 
 
 
 
 Richard, Olivia. 
 It's Detective Benson. 
 I know. 
 A year and a half in the Special Victims Unit. 
 A graduate of Siena College. 
 It's public record. 
 You can find almost anything if you know where to look. 
 You know what you are? 
 A realtor? 
 You're a Nosy Parker. 
 And you're a bitch. 
 Did I hit a nerve? 
 I don't have any nerves. 
 How about you? 
 We'll see. 
 Look... 
 I got a quaint turn of the century rathole to show. 
 Unless you've got some evidence to book me... 
 Go with God, Richard. 
 You have to let him back on the street? 
 You gave it your best shot. 
 It didn't work this time. 
 We're gonna get him back here, and when we do... 
 We've got two things for you. 
 Dussault's dead. 
 Canadians found him colder than a witch's boob at a shack in Moosonee, Canada. 
 OD'd on skag. 
 Poor guy. 
 Poor guy? 
 Yeah. 
 Imagine trying to score smack in a place called Moosonee. 
 It must've been hell. 
 Easier to cop yak turds. 
 Okay, Dussault's dead. 
 That leaves White as our lead contestant. 
 What's the other thing? 
 I know a guy on the Realty Board. 
 I had him look into WhitePhillips. 
 They don't just sell houses, they make loans. 
 I thought that was legal. 
 It is, but most of the people are low income. 
 They don't read the fine print and 70% of the loans wind up in foreclosure. 
 The bulk of their income comes from high interest and penalties. 
 The loan division makes much more compared to the realty division. 
 They don't make out selling off the foreclosures? 
 Only the loan division makes out because they own the foreclosures. 
 Here's the rub... 
 Phillips is not a partner in the loan division. 
 So she pulls down squat compared to White. 
 Tapt State Bank 72 Pine Street Monday, November 15 
 We just want to see Kimberly Phillips' bank account, and Richard White's and the company's. 
 Would you like to open an account for yourself while you're at it? 
 Maybe get a free toaster oven? 
 We could get a warrant. 
 Sounds like a good idea. 
 Well, it might not sound like such a good idea when you have detectives swarming all over your bank. 
 Looking for what? 
 Russian mob, laundering drug money, whatever. 
 Believe me, you don't want to go there. 
 I'll punch them up. 
 Phillips deposits a paycheck from White Phillips Realty every week, and she deposits cash. 
 How much? 
 Three grand in cash every week. 
 Check this out. 
 The White Loan Company withdraws three grand a week, puts it under miscellaneous expenses. 
 That's the perk Phillips gets for nonownership... taxfree income. 
 Three grand a week under the table? Not bad. 
 I could send my kids to private school and still put away 50 bucks a week for their college fund. 
 Stabler. 
 No Kimberly Phillips, huh? 
 You got any other names there? 
 Thanks a lot. 
 What is it? 
 Just got the printout from the lockbox where we were with Phillips. 
 Does it work the way she said? 
 Is her name on it? 
 No. His name is. 
 She's carrying around White's beeper. 
 Let's talk to her again. 
 We don't give a damn about your financial dealings. 
 That's for the IRS. 
 And we don't give a damn about the IRS unless you're not willing to talk to us. 
 The way I described the beginning of the partnership wasn't totally accurate. 
 Okay, so what did you leave out? 
 From the start he told me that we'd be dealing with lowincome clients. 
 Basically finding a legal way to rip them off. 
 That didn't sit well with me, so that's why I turned him down. 
 Super, you've got a conscience. So? 
 He didn't take my refusal as easily as I'd said. 
 He got this really frightening look in his eye. 
 I thought he was gonna hit me in front of the other brokers. 
 Then he pulled himself together and I got the flowers the next day. 
 And? 
 He had no way of knowing my home address. 
 That scared me. 
 Doesn't sound like the beginnings of a beautiful friendship. 
 You're frightened and you think he's following you? 
 The day I said yes to the partnership, he followed me to an open house. 
 I saw him in the rearview mirror. 
 You could've called the cops. 
 Well, they blew me off. 
 There's no law against what he did. 
 There's some harassment law that you have to say you're afraid for your life or that you've been threatened. 
 He was offering me a job. 
 And a job pays you a 150 grand per annum, taxfree. 
 I'm sure that took the edge off your fear. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 He used the same threat to get you to provide an alibi for the Fitzgerald rape. 
 He told you to use his beeper to open that lockbox that day, didn't he? 
 You knew his history. 
 You've been in the courtroom with Fitzgerald. 
 You had to have put it all together. 
 I did. 
 He threatened to kill me if I said anything. 
 And I knew that he would. 
 I'm getting a warrant for Mr. White. 
 Apartment Of Richard White 192 Riverside Drive Monday, November 15 
 Two bags, please. 
 Have this developed, and run this through the ESDA machine. 
 It'll pull up all the writing that was on the page above it. 
 Hey, hey, check this out. 
 Yeah. 
 A map of Central Park. 
 He circled the Ramble. It's got dates and times written all over it. 
 All the times are approximately the same. 
 That date and time. 
 The Fitzgerald rape. 
 You got it. 
 Look. 
 All the other dates and times are all prior to the rape. 
 I'm guessing she was there and he was stalking her. 
 Thank you. 
 Chains and sluts, whips and spikes, whores on the rack. 
 This stuff makes de Sade read like Beatrix Potter. 
 Fits his need to control. 
 You know, I should have Forensics into my house once a week just to clean up. 
 I went through all of his closets. 
 A lot of hangers, a few clothes. 
 I don't suppose you found a.44? 
 Or evidence that he owns one? 
 Nada. 
 Just found a picture of Louise Billings, the date rape vic, in his freezer. 
 No food in the fridge. 
 White knew we'd be here eventually. 
 Practically dared us to bust him at the station. 
 He's gone. 
 He's gone for good. 
 I got a list of all the White Phillips foreclosures that are still empty. 
 We got uniforms looking at them now. 
 Maybe he'll turn up. 
 That's the idea. 
 Hey, Benson. 
 Yeah? 
 I hear you may be in this guy's sights the way you squared off in the interrogation room. 
 He was just trying to mess with my head. Nothing to worry about. 
 Yeah, well... everyone at SVU has got your back. 
 Thanks, John. 
 Need a lift home? 
 I'm just waiting for Elliot to get back from Forensics. 
 It's just as well. 
 I didn't bring in my car. 
 Hey, John. 
 Electrostatic detection apparatus report. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 ESDA. 
 I never knew what it stood for either. 
 It pulled up all the writing off the pad we found at White's. 
 It didn't give us a hell of a lot, though. 
 What's it got? 
 A list of places. A gym, laundry, pharmacy, grocery store. 
 I called them all to see if Fitzgerald used any of them. 
 She didn't. 
 This is your gym, your laundry, your grocery store. 
 Who is it? 
 Elliot. 
 One of your neighbors let me in. 
 I was in the neighborhood. 
 Thought I'd give you a lift. 
 Elliot, what's going on? 
 Last night Munch offered to give me a lift home. 
 Munch did that? 
 Yeah, that's not like him, is it? 
 Then this morning you're offering to drive me to work. 
 "In the neighborhood"? 
 I was. 
 You have a sedan with you? 
 Yep. 
 Which means that you drove all the way uptown from the Queensboro Bridge, dropped off the car, picked up the sedan, turned around, all the way back downtown to get here. 
 That's a lot of neighborhood, my friend. 
 Stop acting like a cop. 
 That's what Richard White would like me to do. 
 Look, I appreciate everyone's concern. 
 But we don't know that White's coming for me. 
 He may have gone out of town. 
 Okay. 
 I sure as hell wouldn't drive to Queens to save your ass. 
 Yeah, you would. 
 That's only because you have a wife and kids. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Stabler. 
 We'll be right there. 
 Apartment Of Louise Billings 121 West 74th Street Tuesday, November 16 
 Lopez, Homicide. 
 Benson, Stabler. 
 What happened? 
 Neighbor heard shots fired, called it in an hour ago. 
 We found one of your cards here. 
 We thought you might want to know. 
 Where is she? 
 The bedroom. 
 This was cold. Ugly. 
 You know anything about who might be involved? 
 Right now your guess is as good as ours. 
 You recover any spent rounds? 
 Not yet. 
 Casings from a.44. 
 When you take the casings and the rounds... when you find them... to Forensics, check to see if they came from the same gun that did Karen Fitzgerald in the Ramble. 
 You got a perp in mind? 
 Richard White. 
 He raped her a few months back. 
 We're waiting for an ME, but it doesn't look like she was raped this time. 
 You mind if we talk to your witness? 
 This way. 
 Mr. Cummings, I'm Detective Benson. 
 This is my partner, Detective Stabler. 
 What did you do after you heard the shots? 
 Nothing at first. 
 You know the way you read in the papers, "It sounded like firecrackers"? 
 It sounded like firecrackers. 
 I was about to go back to bed. 
 But you didn't? 
 No. 
 After the shooting, I heard a man's voice say, "bitch." 
 These walls are paper thin. 
 So I went to my front door and I looked through the peep hole. 
 What did you see? 
 Stocky guy, 40's maybe. 
 Headed for the stairs. 
 You saw his face? 
 Yeah. 
 He turned and looked directly at my door like he could see right through it. 
 That's him. Only... 
 Only what? 
 Well, he don't look so nuts in the picture. 
 Okay, thank you very much. 
 Thank you. 
 When you're through here, give SVU a call. 
 We'll give you what we've got on White. 
 You got an extra photo? 
 Plenty to go around. 
 We should have seen it coming. 
 White had a picture of her in the freezer. 
 He wasn't waiting to thaw it out for dinner. 
 He was fixed on her. 
 We're not seers. 
 We couldn't have offered her protection. 
 Isn't that our job, protecting? Serving? 
 If there were eight million of us, we could protect everyone in the city. 
 Then everyone would be able to sleep. 
 Are you going to sleep tonight, Elliot? 
 Or are you going to think about her? 
 There are uniforms. There is Homicide out there looking for White. 
 So let's think about cooperation for a change. 
 I mean total cooperation. 
 We don't need the glory... we need White off the streets. 
 Jeffries, Briscoe. 
 Yeah? 
 Get some uniforms, recheck those empty foreclosures. 
 There's a list at the sergeant's desk. 
 Munch, Cassidy. 
 I want you to help throw up a wall around Phillips, then keep at her. 
 Maybe there's some friend of White's, or some enemy, that she's forgotten. 
 If she gives you anything, you leave people with her. All right? 
 Benson, you got a second? 
 What? 
 I don't want you out there today. 
 I need to be out there. 
 No, come on. 
 You've really pissed this guy off. 
 He's focused on you. 
 If he is still in the city, you could be next on his to do list. 
 I need to watch my partner's back. 
 We'll get him someone else. 
 Captain, when I first came on board here, you told me that I don't get to pick the vic. 
 So what if I'm the next potential vic? 
 The same rule should still apply. 
 Let me do my job. 
 I want you back here safe tonight. 
 Okay. 
 All right, everybody. 
 Let's move out. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Is there an Olivia Benson here? 
 I'm Benson. 
 Two dozen roses. 
 Your boyfriend must really love you. 
 "No hard feelings." 
 Where do you work? 
 Oh, here we go. 
 Charged the credit card of Lila White. 
 Lila White? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. Credit card went through. 
 It was a platinum card. 
 Those bastards take a hunk out of my profits. 
 Have you got an address on this? 
 Sure. 
 Home Of Lila White Riverdale, New Jersey Tuesday, November 16 
 Mrs. White, what time did your son get here? 
 Around 9:00 a.m. 
 He looked disheveled, harried. 
 He also wanted to borrow some money. 
 That's generally when I see him... when he wants to borrow money. 
 He's a taker. 
 Did he say why he needed it? 
 I assumed because he had none. 
 Richard's never been good with money. 
 He learned from his father. 
 Is his father here? 
 He's dead. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm not. 
 Richard uses his father's death to use me. 
 To play on guilt he thinks I feel because his father killed himself. 
 When did that happen? 
 Five years ago last week. 
 His father was a taker, too. 
 Like I've been telling him since he was a little boy. 
 Told him what? 
 I thought he needed to know how the world worked. 
 That he needed to grab control, take things for himself. 
 And yet, you still give him money. 
 Well, he is my son after all. 
 Did your son say where he was going when he left? 
 Back to Manhattan. 
 He was going to look up some special lady friend. 
 A policewoman. 
 I told him he should drop her before she started taking from him... no offense. 
 But I understand that you people don't make any real money. 
 And for that... you get to deal with filth all day. 
 All shapes and sizes. 
 I'll walk you in. 
 I know how to protect myself. 
 I'm not a civilian. 
 You're not a superhero, either. 
 Elliot, if I let White change my life in any way, he wins. 
 I'm not going to let him win. 
 This isn't about winning. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Blink your lights when you get inside. 
 You're just going to sit here all night until I do, aren't you? 
 You stubborn son of a bitch. 
 Yes, I am. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 Oh God. 
 Benson. 
 Hi, Olivia. 
 Where are you? 
 I want to see you, talk to you. 
 I know you want to see me. 
 You've been trying all day. 
 Let's meet. 
 Where? 
 Somewhere you'll feel safe. 
 The stationhouse. 
 Funny. 
 Make it the Ramble. 
 A bench that brings back fond memories. 
 You know the one. 
 7:00 a.m. 
 Don't be late. 
 Olivia, I'm not a fool. 
 If I see one cop, we'll never consummate our relationship. 
 Run, bitch! 
 Drop it, freak, now! Drop it! 
 On the ground, White, get down! 
 Just turn over and shut up. 
 You lying, coward bitch! 
 He wants to confess. 
 All right, let's do it. 
 No. 
 He wants to play my reactions while he's doing it. 
 He'll get off on that. 
 Which is good. 
 He'll be thinking with the wrong head, give you the advantage. 
 Okay. /Hey. 
 The gun. 
 He's gotta cop to using the gun. 
 Got it. 
 Olivia, I was wondering. 
 I thought you stood me up. 
 Of course not. I just had a few things I had to take care of. 
 Makeup, hair? 
 You look nice. 
 Thank you. 
 So, you wanted to talk. 
 Yes. 
 I was wondering though, how's your mother? 
 Fine. 
 How's yours? 
 You met her. 
 The classic refrigerator mother. 
 About your mother, though, Serena, isn't it? 
 Is she still carrying around all those scars from that rape? 
 Is she still having nightmares? 
 Let's talk about Karen Fitzgerald. 
 One track mind. Compulsive. 
 Good for you. 
 How'd it happen? 
 We had a history, you know. 
 So did you, I hear. 
 Yeah, I knew her. 
 She was smart, competent. 
 Not really. Not like you. 
 She like to read in the Ramble. 
 Same time, same day, every week. 
 That must have made it easy for you. 
 Too easy. 
 Too easy? 
 Then why stalk her? 
 Stalk? 
 That's sort of purple, isn't it? 
 We both happened to go to a place we thought was safe, picturesque. 
 Filled with bird watchers and "moes." Relaxing. 
 Do you relax? 
 Seeing what you see every day, knowing how the world is, how bizarre and ugly it is? 
 Yeah, I relax. 
 Bath? 
 Chanting? 
 Yoga? 
 So, she didn't hear me sneak up behind her. 
 She struggled a bit. 
 It's hard to do when somebody's squeezing your trachea. 
 It sounds a bit like... styrofoam peanuts crunching. 
 That's very descriptive. 
 Thank you. 
 In the clearing, I picked up a rock, I showed it to her, hit her with it. 
 She yelped. 
 She didn't scream. 
 She yelped like a whipped dog. 
 I made her crawl to me and ask me for my forgiveness for what she did to me. 
 What did she do to you again? 
 In court she embarrassed me. 
 Oh, right. 
 She made a gurgling sound. 
 I took that for an apology. 
 I accepted. 
 Then I took her. 
 I think she liked it. 
 What do you think? 
 It doesn't matter what I think. 
 It does to me. 
 You're still listening, so there must be something you're enjoying about my story. 
 Maybe something's lacking? 
 I know... 
 You want me to say I killed her. 
 You need that detail to kill me. 
 Did you kill her? 
 I had a knife... and I cut her. 
 And I watched her blood seep into the ground taking her life with it. 
 He'll never say he used a gun. 
 He gets that detail wrong, he could duck the death penalty. 
 He probably tossed it in the Hudson. 
 You look disappointed, Olivia. 
 What's the matter? 
 Cat got your tongue? 
 Just ... tell me once more, how'd you kill her? 
 Thrill seeker. 
 No. I'm through. 
 Do what you can with what you got. 
 I don't think you can kill me with it. 
 Pity. 
 I'm fixed on you. 
 And until I'm dead, I'll always be in your head. 
 Just like your mother has somebody in her head. 
 We're joined at the hip now, aren't we? 
 Detective Stabler, how are Kathy and the kids?
