 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 What've we got? 
 A dead victim, head bashed in, privates exposed. 
 Tech found seminal fluid on the face, legs and mouth, and we thought of you. 
 Was she a resident of the building? 
 He. 
 We've ID'd him as Seth Langdon. 
 He lived in the building on the sixth floor. 
 Nice twobedroom but he lived alone as far as we could tell. 
 Looks like this is where it went down. 
 This guy didn't die quietly. 
 Somebody must've heard something. 
 They did. There was a loud party in the building in 3B. 
 Pretty ironic ending, don't you think? 
 Why's that? 
 Well, him being Seth Langdon and all. 
 Son of William H. Langdon? 
 Head of The Moral Coalition? 
 Yeah, the guy who's always going around preaching about good clean wholesome living. 
 Believes homosexuality can be cured. 
 That's one way to fix 'em. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x10 Closure (1) 
 Original air date : 2000/01/07 
 What's going on? 
 Here, John. 
 What's this? 
 Police union found us better health insurance. 
 This form is longer than the last book I read. 
 Don't you see what they're doing? 
 They're looking out for you, Munch. 
 Psychiatric coverage increased to 80%/2. 
 Relax, it's just a medical form. 
 Right, as soon as they find out that your mother had diabetes or that your father had male pattern baldness... sorry, Chief... they'll have your entire genealogical... not to mention, genetic fingerprint. 
 They'll know when you're gonna die, how it's gonna occur and what song you want sung at your funeral. 
 There's two "r"s in hemorrhoids. 
 I'm a desk jockey, what do you want from me? 
 See, she's got the right idea. 
 Leave the father's side blank, that'll mess 'em up. 
 Let's keep our eyes on our own paper. 
 Okay, talk to me about our rooftop homicide, people. 
 Name's Seth Langdon. 
 White male, 21. 
 He was at a party on the third floor of his building, made his way up to the rooftop around 1:00 am., there was seminal fluid found on the victim... we're assuming it's premortem. 
 Genitals were exposed. 
 He was beat up pretty good, culminating in his head being bashed up against the AC unit. 
 Lover's quarrel. 
 Sexual predator from the party? 
 Initial ME report has two types of seminal fluid... one the victim's... 
 The other the doer's? 
 What do you say we start with the hosts, work our way through the guest list. 
 Langdon? I just read this piece about William Langdon, spouting off about how homosexuals can be cured. 
 Victim was his son. 
 Get out of here. 
 One out of every 10 men is gay. 
 Let's see how Mr. Langdon felt about that statistic hitting home. 
 Don't make any more barbs about Benson's father. 
 Excuse me? 
 You don't know the history there? 
 No, what was he, an alcoholic? 
 Deadbeat dad? Jehovah's Witness? 
 The only thing she knows about him was he was the man who raped her mother. 
 Moral Coalition 520 West 69th Street Monday, November 22 
 Excuse me, who are you? 
 How did you get by reception? 
 We're Detectives Benson and Stabler. 
 We need to see William Langdon. 
 Mr. Langdon's not seeing anyone today. 
 We're not here selling Amway. 
 It's all right, Steven, you can let them in. 
 Do you have any idea who might want to do this to your son? 
 No. 
 Was he involved with anyone? 
 Did he have a boyfriend? 
 Or boyfriends? 
 My son was not a homosexual. 
 Mr. Langdon, you are aware of the circumstances of your son's death? 
 Seth was merely... going through a rebellious phase, all children do. 
 We had it under control. 
 Just how do you control a person's natural sexual orientation? 
 Homosexuality is not natural. 
 It is a crime against God. 
 And AIDS is divine retribution. 
 Are you being flippant with me? 
 We're really just trying to find your son's killer, Mr. Langdon. 
 That's our only agenda here. 
 Seth was so confused. 
 I did everything I could to help him. 
 I got him into one of those sexual rehabilitation centers. 
 They have an excellent success rate. 
 Seth completed the program two months ago. 
 Meaning he was "cured"? 
 Yes. 
 So, the party got a little bit out of hand. 
 Oh, I see. 
 You hear "gay" and "party" and naturally you think S & M orgy. 
 No, but the last party I went to, everyone made it home alive. 
 The victim's blood alcohol was 0.15. 
 If you were a bartender you'd be legally responsible. 
 I haven't tended bar since Studio 54 closed. 
 Think... did anybody, for any reason, stand out that night in one way or another? 
 If they didn't, they wouldn't have gotten in the door. 
 Our guests were very prominent members of the community. 
 Prominent or not, we need their names and addresses. 
 How well did you know Seth? 
 He just moved in recently. 
 I guess we saw him a handful of times in the building's gym. 
 He's a nice kid. 
 Still finding himself... so much turmoil. 
 Seth hook up with anybody at this party? 
 On the contrary, you might say he unhooked... from the goodlooking blond gentleman he walked in the door with. 
 This man have a name? 
 He didn't stay long enough for us to catch it. 
 After one drink, Seth got a little flirtatious. 
 His friend got upset and insisted they leave. 
 The next thing, they're exchanging words in the hallway. 
 They leave together? 
 No. 
 Seth came back in by himself, grabbed a bottle of beer and headed for the balcony, we assumed, to cool down. 
 What happened on the roof was outside of our world. 
 This was a very civilized gathering. 
 "Just stay out of my life!" 
 And then we hear a beer bottle smash outside our window. 
 Is this your apartment? 
 Yeah, the ground floor apartment. 
 It's the only way we can afford this building. 
 On top of which I do light maintenance and my husband's the weekend super. 
 These are the detectives investigating that man's murder. 
 Can't believe it happened. 
 What do you know about the parties in 3B? 
 Normally they're quiet. 
 Except last night, we get three phone calls complaining about the music. 
 Finally, Jesse had to go up and talk to them. 
 And what time was that? 
 Around 1:00. 
 By any chance, did you happen to see him at that time? 
 No, I didn't go in. I just asked them to turn down the music and I left. 
 When you heard the bottle smash, you look out the window? 
 Yes. 
 And what'd you see? 
 A blond guy getting into a Lincoln Town Car, you know, the chauffeurdriven type. 
 Anything come up on any of the party guests? 
 No, I just started inputting them. 
 What? 
 Your father comment I made earlier, I didn't know he was a... you know. 
 A rapist. 
 I know. 
 Listen, Cragen and Stabler know. 
 Otherwise l... 
 Got it. 
 Thanks. 
 Ever catch the guy? 
 Nope. 
 Were there any leads at the time? 
 Nope. 
 You ever need to talk to anybody, I'm here. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, we got the kid on the car service. 
 The man picked up in front of the victim's building, was driven to a brownstone on the Upper East Side. 
 Name is Steven Hale. 
 Good. 
 Home Of Steven Hale 259 East 76th Street Tuesday, November 23 
 What are you doing here? 
 You're boss had no idea, did he? 
 About what? 
 What you did to his son. 
 Daddy, let's go! 
 Why would a gay man work for Langdon, one of the most conservative bigots in the country? 
 Hale's not exactly open about his sexuality. 
 Don't you think Hale's wife and kid think he has an uncanny ability to accessorize? 
 Have you seen him? 
 He doesn't accessorize all that well. 
 Maybe Hale's not gay. 
 Right. 
 How do you prove it? 
 One very tried and true way... jealousy. 
 Witnesses said Hale was jealous when Seth started hitting on other guys. 
 Ah, the old greeneyed monster. 
 Maybe Hale thought that by working for Langdon he'd be cured. 
 Like Langdon thought Camp Wild Bunch cured his own son. 
 And Daddy knows best. 
 And makes damn sure everyone else knows it. 
 I don't know how people, smart people, educated people, think that way. 
 I mean actually think you can change the way somebody's wired. 
 You know anyone who would actually choose to be gay... risk family rejection... discrimination? 
 I mean, Choose all that heartache? 
 Heartache is not unique to being gay. 
 But I know what you mean. 
 In those camps one of the treatments is electroshock therapy to the groin. 
 Sound familiar? 
 Yeah, Avenal's tried it on s*x offenders. 
 Yeah. With much the same success. 
 You're saying we're like William H. Langdon? 
 No, we don't try to rewire people. 
 We try to contain them. 
 Look at him. 
 Steven Hale is fuming. 
 He's been living a lie, we happen to catch him at it. 
 Of course he's mad. 
 Specifically, he's mad at you. 
 Which is why we thought you'd have better luck with him. 
 Yeah, you're smart and God knows you're patient. 
 I am not a homosexual! 
 Okay. 
 Part of my job was to keep an eye on Seth. 
 Mr. Langdon is seriously eyeing a run for a congressional seat, but the scandal of an openly homosexual son... 
 Look at the damage the lesbian sister caused Newt. 
 Actually, she was a halfsister. 
 She may have been a halfsister but unfortunately for Newt, she was all lesbian. 
 You don't think Newt's problems had anything to do with his ethics violations or him being a pedantic megalomaniac who espouses family values while serving his cancerstricken wife with divorce papers while she's on her hospital deathbed? 
 Did that ever occur to you? 
 Anybody know where Cassidy is? 
 Seth didn't show up at his father's fundraiser that night, Mr. Langdon asked me to check up on him. 
 But when I got to his floor, Seth brushed right by me. 
 I followed, giving him a piece of my mind, and the next thing I knew, I find myself at that party. 
 You were upset that he was flirting, right? 
 Because it was revolting. 
 Of course, I tried to persuade him to leave. 
 He wouldn't but... 
 And what he said on the balcony? 
 Was not a breakup. 
 "Stay out of my life" was a message to his father. 
 If only I tried harder to get him away from there, he'd still be alive. 
 Okay, guys, where do we stand? 
 The wife confirms that he never left the house after the car service dropped him off around 12:30. 
 He is mentioned in the victim's journal. 
 But only in pejorative terms. 
 Believe me, No love affair there. 
 And Mr. Langdon confirmed that he sent him to check on his son. 
 We send Steven Hale home. 
 With our apologies for the inconvenience? 
 Of course. 
 Okay, I guess that takes us back to the party guests. 
 Yeah, I crossreferenced them against the journal, but no history with any of them. 
 Wow, this is some shindig. 
 We've got names from the "Social Register," an assemblyman, a major AIDS fundraiser. 
 None of whom are likely to be big fans of the victim's father. 
 Prominent or not, let's check 'em all. 
 Andre Lasnik? 
 I'm in the middle of rehearsal here. 
 And we're in the middle of a homicide investigation. 
 Seth Langdon... did you have any interaction with him? 
 We were introduced in passing. 
 It's horrible what happened. 
 What time did you leave the party? 
 After 1:00... with my first chair bassoon and... another couple. 
 Lee Vaughn and Joaquin Morano. 
 We took a taxi to the Carlyle. 
 We understand that Seth was very... friendly at the party. 
 And that you two seemed particularly chummy. 
 Look, I'm almost 20 years his senior. 
 We talked about his childhood. 
 I gathered, due to the dynamic with the father, Seth probably sought out the affections of older men or unobtainable men. 
 So you of course did the noble thing? 
 I admit I was torn. 
 I excused myself to the restroom to get perspective. 
 When I came out he was gone. 
 Was anyone else gone when you got back? 
 Not that I noticed. 
 Maybe you could tell from the tape. 
 What tape is that? 
 One of the guests had a camcorder. 
 Had it going the whole time. 
 Assemblyman Rossi's boyfriend, Joe. 
 Joe Bandolini. 
 Officer Bandolini? 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, can we have a few minutes of your time? 
 In private? 
 The Langdon case? 
 We understand you have a videotape of the party. 
 The party, not the murder. 
 Your tape could show the events leading up to the murder. 
 It doesn't. 
 You mind if we judge that for ourselves? 
 Actually I do. 
 I've managed to keep my personal life and the job completely separate. 
 No one in my squad knows, not even my partner. 
 I'd like to keep it that way. 
 We are not looking to change that. 
 This'll be handled with discretion. 
 Right. 
 Tape goes into evidence and somehow finds itself circulating the precinct, I'm finished. 
 It's not gonna happen. 
 You're right, it's not. 
 You gonna make us get a warrant? 
 Look, I'm a good cop. 
 If there was anything on that tape to help your investigation, I'd tell you. 
 Not good enough. 
 You'll do right by us, I promise you... 
 I'm promising you we'll do right by you. 
 I'll come by your squadroom in the morning. 
 55th Precinct Vice Squad Thusday, November 23 
 How did we solve cases back then? 
 No FBI link up, no DNA, no high-tech forensics. 
 Cood old fashioned shoe leather. 
 Was Conklin a good detective? 
 One of the best, may he rest in peace. 
 I wish I could've talked to him. 
 Would've gotten you more than reading his notes. 
 He was a spotty note taker, but up here, a steel trap. 
 He remembered every detail of every case he worked. 
 He didn't have much on the Benson case. 
 Any idea what "Pull in CK" means? 
 CK, this is '68. 
 That's gotta be Carl Kudlak. 
 We pulled him in on a bunch of rapes back then. 
 Took us forever to finally pin one on him. 
 Why's that? 
 Had a wife who alibied him every time. 
 She killed herself in '72... or we never would've gotten him. 
 Thanks. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Can you shut the door? 
 I believe you've met Officer Bandolini. 
 And this is Mr. Shore, his GOAL representative. 
 GOAL? 
 Do we really need the Gay Officers Action League involved in all this? 
 We understand you and your partner have been harassing Officer Bandolini. 
 I'm afraid we have to intervene. 
 Harassed? 
 We in no way harassed your officer. 
 We asked for him to turn over a piece of evidence to us. 
 We don't consider threats of legal action and public humiliation a courtesy. 
 Public humiliation? 
 Okay, okay. 
 Obviously, there's a misunderstanding here, alright? 
 Just don't forget we're all on the same side. 
 Let's sit down and see if we can work this out amicably. 
 That's necessary. 
 We've both reviewed the tape and I assure you it contains no compelling evidence. 
 With all due respect, sir, that's really our call to make. 
 All we need to do is to view it. 
 You have your needs, we have our rights. 
 Meanwhile, if Officer Bandolini is outed, even accidentally on purpose, you'll be hit with a defamation suit that will make your head spin. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, this is just great. 
 They filed an injunction. 
 I think you better get Benson in here. 
 Yep. 
 I had a little free time last night, so I looked up your case. 
 The Langdon case? 
 No, your mother's. 
 The detective who investigated is dead so I spoke to one of his proteges. 
 Munch, it's not that I don't appreciate the thought, but I'm already on it. 
 I can't tell you how many times I've gone over the report, listened to his statement, gone through six packs. 
 Spoke to investigators, visited the crime scene? 
 Trust me... 
 I've pulled everything there is to pull. 
 I don't think this was pullable. 
 I don't know what it will come to, but from what I've heard, he's right for it. 
 You bothering my partner? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Forensics Laboratory One Police Plaza Wednesday, November 24 
 I have to warn you, The RFLP wasn't back yet. 
 But I ran a couple of quick test results through the databank, and I got a hit. 
 What's the name? 
 This isn't going to hold up in court, mind you, but I ran the PCR and the mitochondrial. 
 They're quick but... 
 The name? 
 Ray Gunther. 
 Why do I know that name? 
 We studied him at the academy. 
 He was the guy who terrorized women for an entire summer in the early '80s. 
 He was known as the Parkway Rapist. 
 But they put him away. 
 He's out. 
 There's no way they would release Ray Gunther. 
 He brutally raped seven women... two of which had to have reconstructive surgery. 
 Maybe he escaped. 
 Anything from SingSing? 
 They've had me on hold for 10 minutes. 
 If he escaped, he took the whole administrative staff with him. 
 Yes, I need to speak with the DA who handled the Ray Gunther case. 
 He was paroled. 
 That was my guess. 
 When? 
 A month ago. 
 Why? 
 He served 15 of his 25 to life. 
 Prisons are overcrowded, you know that got to make room somehow. 
 So by all means let out Ray Gunther, Yeah. knowing the recidivism rate of sexual predators. 
 He's gotta file with the s*x Offender's Registry. 
 We got an address? 
 We do. 
 And you shouldn't have too much trouble finding it. 
 It's in the same building where Seth Langdon was killed. 
 
 
 
 Uh, hi. 
 Hey, Jesse Hansen, right? 
 Detectives, did you catch the guy? 
 No, but we think we're pretty close. 
 Do you need anything else? 
 Do you have any more questions? 
 Just one. 
 Is there a Ray Gunther staying with you? 
 No, no one staying with us. 
 That's funny. 
 This is the address he gave authorities after his parole. 
 Any idea why he would've done that? 
 He's my brother. 
 So why'd you change your last name, Jesse? 
 Come on, you legally change your last name. 
 There's got to be a reason for that. 
 Was "Gunther" not too popular a name in your neighborhood? 
 No, it wasn't. 
 Yeah, People give you a hard time about it, I bet. 
 Yeah, they did. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't let Ray cause any more trouble than he already has. 
 Just tell us where he is. 
 I don't know where he is. 
 But you know what he did. 
 Don't you? 
 Why do we have to be separated? 
 It's just standard procedure. 
 I know my husband. 
 He's not going to say anything. 
 But you don't know the psychological hold that Ray has over him. 
 We're listening. 
 Jesse was 15 when they locked Ray up. 
 Reporters snuck into his high school and asked him questions... in front of his classmates. 
 Jesse said he thought Ray should be put to death. 
 They ran that as a headline. 
 Ray has been working that guilt ever since. 
 Is that why Jesse let him stay with you when he got out? 
 Yes, but I couldn't take it after a week. 
 I had to put my foot down. 
 He was talking to Jesse about getting him a job in his construction crew. 
 That would have been bad? 
 It would've ruined his life. 
 Because they would've found out he was Ray's brother. 
 Because they would've found out he was a Gunther. 
 The whole family's bad. 
 The father was in and out of jail his whole miserable life, The mother is a piece of garbage. 
 And I don't have to tell you about Ray. 
 There is nothing but bad blood in that whole family. 
 Did you see Ray in your building the night Seth was killed? 
 He was in our apartment till 1:00 in the morning. 
 Where is he now? 
 I don't know. 
 There's a piece of white trash, used to visit him in prison... stripper named Cindy Stocklash... might be shacked up with her. 
 Any clue where she could be? 
 The one time I met her, she was explaining how she wanted to change motels. 
 Apparently, hers didn't get p0rn. 
 p0rn. 
 That narrows it down. 
 Please state your name, miss. 
 Serina Benson. 
 Address? 
 1104 West End Avenue, Apartment B. 
 You were raped? 
 Yes. 
 You gotta speak up, honey. 
 The a... campus library closed at midnight. 
 I took the shortcut home I always take. 
 It was darker than usual. 
 I was halfway through when something hit me from behind. 
 You were knocked unconscious? 
 Yes. 
 When I came to I was on a landing below street level. 
 There was a man on top of me. 
 He was... he pushed on my dress. 
 He engaged in sexual intercourse? 
 Can you describe him? 
 He had sideburns and... 
 I don't know. 
 Everything looked distorted. 
 What number was that, four? 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Who is it? 
 Detectives, Ms. Stocklash. 
 We'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 Everything okay in there? 
 What do we have here? 
 Ray Gunther. 
 You okay? 
 Nope. 
 Good. 
 Ray? Did you hurt him? 
 Did they hurt you, Ray? 
 Don't you touch him! 
 You shut the hell up! 
 He didn't do nothing. 
 I said, shut up! 
 I'm sorry, what is it you think I did? 
 You're under arrest for the murder of Seth Langdon. 
 You don't have jack. 
 Yeah, you're right. All we have are witnesses who put you at the building that night. 
 Didn't we have something else? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You left a little evidence in the victims mouth. 
 Ray! 
 Don't worry, they got the wrong guy. 
 Wrong guy, but you'll look right to the jury. 
 Out one month and back to your old tricks. 
 Think you'd throw them by switching from highways to rooftops? 
 You used the same excessive force. 
 You beat your victims to a pulp, just like you did Seth, Ray. 
 But you had a little trouble adjusting back to civilian s*x, didn't you, Ray? 
 He didn't have no trouble. 
 Shut up! 
 You're a little confused. 
 Okay, why Seth? 
 Why'd you pick him? 
 I didn't pick nobody. 
 Did you even know him? 
 I used to see him in the gym. 
 Me and Jesse used to work out everyday. 
 Sometimes he'd be there. 
 He was pathetic. 
 Him trying to pump up that puny body of his. 
 So what happened? 
 What? Did he hit on you? 
 Or was it you? 
 Did you like them puny like that? 
 Now that you mention it, he did remind me of a bitch I had in prison. 
 You're pathetic. 
 What's wrong, you jealous, sweetheart? 
 Easy. 
 Not sweetheart. 
 That's Detective Benson, all right? 
 I want an apology from you. 
 I don't need an apology from this slimebag. 
 But I am starting to get really sick of the sarcastic little remarks, Ray. 
 Look, if this is about me getting a little overzealous with Ray... 
 What are you talking about? 
 Nothing. What's up? 
 We got real problems here. 
 The lab just got the full DNA report back. 
 Yeah, and? 
 And it ain't Ray's. 
 Now remember, I told you the DNA results I gave you wouldn't stand up in court. 
 All I remember is you giving us the name Ray Gunther. 
 Yeah, but when I gave you Ray's name, it was off the quickest tests available. 
 Of which there are two. 
 Naturally, I assumed the hit came from the PCR. 
 As it turns out, the results weren't from PCR which narrows it down one in thousands as compared to RFLP which narrows it down one in billions. 
 This actually came from the mitochonrial. 
 What's the difference? 
 Mitochonrial only narrows it down to bloodline. 
 So while it's definitely not Ray, you are still looking for somebody from that family. 
 A father, a son... 
 Or a brother. 
 Okay. 
 Look, here's the problem. 
 We got this pain in the ass DNA. 
 This make any sense to you? 
 No. 
 Yeah, me either, but it just let your brother off the hook. 
 And it puts you in the hotseat. 
 Which really doesn't make any sense to us. 
 We know your brother's bad, but you've been clean your whole life. 
 Can you explain this, Jesse? 
 No. 
 A blood sample will. 
 I have to give one? 
 We could hold you for 24 hours, during which time you know we could get a court order for you to take it. 
 I got to tell you, though, refusing to take a blood test that'll clear you... that doesn't look good. 
 Maybe... 
 I should call a lawyer. 
 You're free to go. 
 At his trial in '84, they had Ray dead to rights, so he made a sympathy play. 
 Sympathy for a serial rapist? Right. 
 What'd he say, "Women just don't understand me"? 
 No, claims he and Jesse were raped growing up by their dad. 
 The old Menendez defense. 
 Could explain a few things about good old Jesse, huh? 
 Except the prosecution put Jesse on the stand and he said that Ray completely fabricated the story. 
 So how do we know which one is lying? 
 Don't worry, I'm sure he'll have plenty to say once we get the goahead to take his blood. 
 How about you guys? 
 You find anything? 
 Just a pisspoor gene pool. 
 You think Jesse was just born bad? 
 ?? 
 Destiny isn't predetermined. 
 I don't know, there've been cases of twins separated at birth, growing up in completely different environments, who go on to commit crimes with the same MOs. 
 It's eerie. 
 Actually, They've proven transplanting genes from one species to another can alter behavior. 
 We're not rats, we're humans. 
 It all comes down to how you were raised. 
 You instill morals, values, the kid'll turn out all right. 
 If not, then you got trouble. 
 Nature, nurture, ad nauseum... you're assuming a level playing field at birth. 
 I don't know that there is. 
 Hey, something wrong? 
 It's just hitting a little close to home. 
 How's that? 
 The only way that Jesse makes sense in all this, is that they're fruit of the same poisoned tree. 
 You don't really believe that, do you? 
 I understand your DNA tech pulled a little Arkansas twostep. 
 Actually took you to the brother first. 
 Yeah, he's been ruled out. 
 The only way his name came up at all was because it was the same bloodline. 
 Jesse's lawyer is already waving the old ACLU banner asking, "Where does it stop?" 
 "Are we going to test every relative of Ray Gunther's?" 
 No, just the one who lives in the victim's building. 
 I fasttracked the hearing on the blood test for tomorrow. 
 It would be nice to have a safety net. 
 What have you got besides DNA? 
 What we've got are lawyers sandbaging us at every turn. 
 Right, the video. 
 What video? 
 Only Seth at a party minutes before his death. 
 But that is tied up in litigation, too. 
 Any way of getting it untied? 
 Let me see if I can make an end run of my own. 
 Officer Bandolini. 
 My representative is not going to be happy about this. 
 I realize I'm bending procedure here. 
 I appreciate you meeting with me. 
 You know we need that tape. 
 And you know what it can do to me. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 In 1926, Bobby Jones was winning the US Open. 
 He hits his ball into the woods. 
 He removes a leaf from under the ball and accidentally moves it. 
 Now, nobody sees this. 
 He hits it out, saves par. 
 I assume there's a point to this story. 
 Mr. Jones did the honorable thing. 
 He declared the penalty. 
 And he went on to win the Open? 
 No, he lost by a stroke. 
 But he said he never lost any sleep over it because he did the right thing. 
 That was just a game. 
 This is my life we're talking about. 
 And how are you sleeping? 
 I don't know why I brought the damn camcorder to the party. 
 That's what I keep kicking myself over. 
 There's nothing illegal or criminal on that tape, but the consequences... 
 I will do everything in my power to make sure there aren't any. 
 You have my word on that. 
 You planned on handing this over all along, didn't you? 
 Yeah. 
 But I enjoyed the golf story. 
 Okay, that's Seth. 
 Okay, fast forward. Forward. 
 Forward. 
 Stop! 
 Rewind and play. 
 Stop. 
 Enhance section A6. 
 Zoom in on the door. 
 Yep, there's Jesse. 
 Let's see if he joins the party. 
 You know a lot about video analyzing, Munch. 
 I dabble a little. 
 Damn it, he didn't even come in. 
 Forward. 
 Stop! 
 Go back to the part about the door again. 
 Go back to just before the door opened. 
 Stop! 
 Zoom in on the mirror. 
 That ain't Jesse. That's Ray. 
 Back to Ray. 
 We need to talk to Lorraine again find out what time each of them actually came back. 
 I told you, Jesse came right back down. 
 And Ray didn't come with him? 
 No, we went to bed right after that. 
 Mrs. Hansen, I need to tell you that providing a false alibi is a felony. 
 It's insane you have my husband accused of his brother's crime. 
 Ray has been hellbent on destroying Jesse his whole life. 
 Why? Why would he want to do that to him? 
 I don't know. 
 Ray would call from prison every week, until Jesse would finally cave in and go see him. 
 And after the visits, Jesse would come home and go into these deep depressions. 
 He wouldn't talk to me about it. 
 He'd just go on these alcohol binges and disappear, sometimes even for days. 
 That must have been really hard for you. 
 When he came back, he'd be his old self again. 
 I promise you, Jesse's a good man. 
 It's his brother that's poison. 
 I can't say we disagree with you. 
 The problem is, it's not Ray's seminal fluid we found in Seth's mouth. 
 But it's definitely the same bloodline. 
 You're lying. 
 Mrs. Hansen... why do you think Jesse won't give us the blood test? 
 Ray came over at 7:00. 
 He drank the whole night again. 
 He went up at 1:00 about the music and Jesse did come right back down, alone. 
 Then what happened? 
 Ray came back a few minutes later, dragged Jesse out with him... 
 Jesse didn't come home till after 2:00. 
 It was a joke. 
 A joke? 
 We'd see that little fag in the gym... 
 That was Seth. 
 Right, Seth. 
 When we'd see that little fag, Seth, in the gym, I'd rib Jesse that it was his girlfriend. 
 That's hysterical. 
 Oh, it gets funnier. 
 I'd catch his eye, nod over to Jesse, and wink. 
 Seth would blush like a little schoolgirl. 
 I'm still waiting for the punchline. 
 It came that night. 
 Start with going up to the party because we have you on tape, with Seth. 
 When they opened the door, I see him looking out. 
 I go right in to the old bit. 
 I nod over to Jesse and give Seth a big old wink. 
 When the door closes, I ask Jesse if he saw his girlfriend. 
 He throws a punch, but he's so plastered he misses by a mile. 
 Then he staggers off down the hall. 
 And you wait? 
 Yep... and out prances Seth. 
 I put my arm around him and say, "Go up on the roof, Jesse'll be right up." 
 Then you went and you got Jesse. 
 Why? 
 Sibling rivalry. 
 Our daddy did everything I said he did. 
 Jesse should've been a man and stood up for me at my trial. 
 Jesse was 15 when you were tried. 
 15 is a lot of years. 
 Someone had to serve because of him. 
 I could've been out in five. 
 You did 15 because of what you did, not Jesse. 
 I think it's horrible that my baby brother killed a man, but... he did. 
 And as much as you'd like to, you can't pin it on me. 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 You set it up. 
 I set up a practical joke. 
 Is there a law against that? 
 Ray told us everything, Jesse. 
 Your brother set you up. 
 I lied at his trial. 
 Ray was telling the truth. 
 Our father really did do those things. 
 To both of you? 
 I tried to forget. 
 Ray wouldn't let me. 
 Even as kids he would tell me how awful it was for him, but that I liked it. 
 Nobody thinks that, Jesse. 
 You were only seven years old. 
 Whenever I'd visit Ray at SingSing, he'd tell me, "You just wait, you'll end up here sooner or later. 
 It's your legacy." 
 Jesse, tell us what happened on the roof. 
 I was wasted. 
 I don't even remember how I got there. 
 All... all I could hear was Ray's voice drawing me up there. 
 It didn't seem real. 
 Someone was on their knees... and... my pants were down... and... 
 I don't know. 
 I killed him. 
 I killed him. 
 I'll file charges for Man One. 
 Jesse, you said that you heard Ray's voice drawing you up to the rooftop. 
 Abby, hold on. 
 Could you hear his voice once you got up there? 
 I could hear him laughing at me, yeah. 
 Jesse, that's because he was there, wasn't he? 
 I just remember coming out of a fog, and then seeing Ray standing in the doorway. 
 He was laughing. 
 And I looked down, and I saw what Seth was doing. 
 And ... 
 Ray said, "I told you." 
 I told you what, that you were gay? 
 That I wanted to kill him. 
 Why? 
 What did he do to you? 
 Not Seth, Ray. 
 I wanted to kill Ray. 
 I just started lashing out at him 'cause in my mind, I was hitting Ray. 
 But he just kept laughing and laughing. 
 I had to shut him up. 
 I took his head and I stated bashing and I just bashed it and bashed it as hard as I could. 
 It was finally quiet... but I looked down and it wasn't Ray, it was Seth. 
 Where was Ray? 
 He was... he was still standing in the doorway. 
 And he said... he said, "Welcome to the family." 
 Tell me we can charge Ray. 
 Inciting a murder, depraved indifference, accessory... 
 That's good for a start. 
 With Ray's priors, he'll end up doing more time than Jesse. 
 Make sure he does, Abby. 
 You heard him. 
 Ray was screwing with his brother's mind his whole life. 
 It had nothing to do with blood. 
 What Jesse did happened because Jesse believed it would. 
 You know that, right? 
 There's something I'm going to need to do. 
 Olivia, what good is it going to do you to know? 
 He's not my father. 
 You sure? 
 Positive.
