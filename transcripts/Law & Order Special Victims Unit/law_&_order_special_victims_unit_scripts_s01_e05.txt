 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 Engine 39, that's a roger. 
 Elliot Stabler, s*x Crimes. 
 What happened? 
 Vic is a Richard F. Schiller, 42. 
 First time? 
 Who the hell is that? 
 Mrs. Hayes, that's my partner, Detective Stabler. 
 Welcome to my house. 
 You all right? 
 She found the body. 
 Wife? Girlfriend? What? 
 Landlord. She lives here with her daughter Virginia. 
 Rented a room to the vic. 
 Where's the daughter? 
 She's out. 
 He was the best tenant. 
 Clean, quiet, always paid on time. Early, even. 
 I want you to take Mrs. Hayes downstairs. 
 I am right here! 
 Don't talk to me like I'm not here! 
 This is my house. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Actually, Mrs. Hayes, I could use a cup of coffee. 
 So, anyone know what this guy's story is? 
 He was a writer, according to the landlady. 
 A writer, huh? 
 Travel book, according to the landlady. 
 Looks like he choked on his own words. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x05 Wanderlust 
 Original air date : 1999/10/18 
 Vietnam, Bosnia and Peru. 
 I heard Kosovo is beautiful this time of year. 
 Look at this. 
 It's good to know the macho Hemingway ideal isn't entirely dead in this weepy age. 
 No. Still as toxic as ever. 
 The last trip Schiller took was during a Chiapas uprising. 
 He rode his motorcycle right through it. 
 Well, that certainly narrows down the reasons why someone would kill this "accidental tourist." 
 He could've been running drugs, written the wrong thing about the wrong country. 
 Don't think so. 
 "I realized it was not the destination that mattered to me as much as the journey itself. 
 It is the insatiable drive to keep moving forward that propels me." 
 His wanderlust is one adverb short of Robert James Waller. 
 "The Bridges of Madison County." 
 That was incredible. 
 How about incredibly banal? 
 Short and muscular sentences displaying total absence of original thinking. 
 I was talking about the movie. 
 What do you got? 
 Vic had a clean record. 
 No next of kin. 
 Divorced 10 years back. 
 His ex-wife runs a tea importing business here in town. 
 Last two years he rented out that room from Mrs. Hayes. 
 Schiller was an ideal tenant. 
 Never missed a payment, not even while he was out of town. 
 Think he can still make direct deposit from the great beyond? 
 Time of death, early evening. 
 No sign of forced entry. 
 The body was left in plain view. 
 C.O. D... from blunt force trauma. 
 And the weapon is where? 
 Still missing. 
 But we do have these. 
 Top of the line. 
 Mm, nice panties. 
 Schiller a he/she? 
 He was a writer. 
 What about the tape over the vic's mouth? 
 No prints. No roll of that type of tape was found in the house. 
 Taping the mouth shut, the panties in the throat both suggest the killer had a personal agenda. 
 To embarrass the hell out of him. 
 Or to shut him up. 
 How well did Schiller know his landlord? 
 The question is, how well did Mrs. Hayes know Schiller? 
 Last night she was non compos mentis. 
 We're gonna talk to her again today. 
 Munch, Cassidy track down Schiller's ex-wife. 
 Durst Publishing 2000 Avenue Of The Americas Tuesday, October 12 
 Mrs. Hayes, we'd like to talk to you. 
 Durst Publishing. 
 One moment. 
 I can't leave this phone. 
 Can't you wait for my break? 
 It won't take very long. 
 Are you okay? 
 Why wouldn't I be? 
 A lot happened last night. 
 Humph! I'll say. 
 Look, I'm sorry, I'm just... 
 I'm worried about Virginia. 
 What time did your daughter get home last night? 
 She didn't. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Your daughter's missing? 
 No. 
 Durst Publishing. One moment. 
 You know, if you give us a recent photo we can circulate it around. 
 Whatever you want. 
 Durst Publishing. 
 One moment. 
 She's very pretty. 
 Like mother, like daughter. 
 Durst Publishing. 
 Yes. 
 Can you take us through what happened last night? 
 Okay, I came home. 
 Came home from where? 
 From work. 
 I came home and... 
 I was going through the mail and I saw a bill for Richard. 
 I thought I'd do him a favor and take it up to him. 
 So I went up there. 
 When I knocked on the door there was no answer, so... 
 Durst Publishing. 
 One moment. 
 When there was no answer, I opened the door and then I found him... lying there. 
 How long have you been renting out that room? 
 Coming up on 11 years now. 
 My ex-husband and I bought that for our future. 
 It quickly became his past. 
 The tenants help cover the mortgage payments. 
 Was Schiller dating anyone in particular? 
 I never saw him bring anyone home. 
 What was your relationship with Schiller? 
 You mean were we sleeping together? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 He was my tenant. 
 It was a business relationship. 
 He had a fantastic credit rating. 
 Durst Publishing. 
 One moment. 
 His editor's two floors up. 
 John Freeman. 
 I always expected this. 
 But I thought it would be foreign officials telling me all they found was a shoe... the lion, the rebels... the volcano got the rest. 
 The guy had a death wish? 
 Please. 
 Thank you. 
 Uncharted territory, what there is of it, was his passion. 
 He always said there's a shortage of blank spaces on the map. 
 We'd just extended his contract. 
 What about Schiller and women? 
 Honestly, he didn't like the baggage. 
 He met so many different kinds of women. 
 It was rare that anyone turned his head. 
 Did you ever know him to solicit s*x? 
 No. No way. Nothing improper. 
 And he poured every last cent into his trips. 
 What about a relationship that got out of hand? 
 I can't think of anyone. 
 We were very open with each other. 
 No, Richard had... this may sound corny, but he had a real sense of honor. 
 His writing is heartfelt, as were his relationships. 
 When they did end, they ended well. 
 His divorce ended in a hug. 
 Teas Of The World 765 West 42nd Street Tuesday, October 12 
 The last time I saw him was a few months back when he came in for a special blend he'd had the last time he was in Morocco. 
 When we first married, he decided to settle down. 
 No more traveling. 
 But I'd catch him... 
 Thank you. 
 Secretly running his fingers over the world atlas. 
 Like it was a Braille Penthouse. 
 I prefer "The Story of O" myself. 
 But I take your point. 
 It got so bad by the end, the very mention of a different area code would spark a fight. 
 Now, ironically, I deal with 10 different countries a day. 
 It's nice you can laugh. 
 Not all marriages end so well. 
 We were good lovers, but better friends. 
 I always knew I wasn't the great love of his life. 
 That's hard to believe. 
 Yet to us, Schiller's a naked corpse on a Barcalounger with lingerie down his throat. 
 Unnerving, isn't it? 
 Such a degrading death could overshadow such a remarkable life? 
 It's like Rockefeller dying on top of his mistress. 
 It's still my preferred way to go. 
 Right. 
 And now? 
 Now we tackle Schiller's address book. 
 All right, let's do it. 
 Yes, Richard Schiller. 
 Gracias. Muchas gracias. 
 Anything from Belize? 
 An excitable tamale-maker who got a nice mention in Schiller's "Windward To Quintana Roo." Otherwise, nada. 
 What about the police in Berlin? 
 Big fat nein. 
 Okay, let's look at who's not in this book. 
 Travelers are used to brief relationships. 
 He could have picked up a stranger, gotten in over his head. 
 The 27 got a call from Crand Central Station. 
 The owner of the Northwest Newsstand caught a shoplifter. 
 Says her name is Virginia Hayes. 
 Yes, Santa Claus, there is a Virginia. 
 Tell them we'll take the report. 
 Already did. 
 She's all yours. 
 I lose between five and 20% of my business with these people. 
 Virginia Hayes? 
 We need you to come with us. 
 Kids today "imaginate" their own rules for what is right, what is wrong. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Hey, who's going to pay for my magazine? 
 There you go. 
 Keep the change. 
 I'm Detective Stabler, and this is my partner Detective Benson. 
 Okay, so you're not juvie truant officers. 
 Excuse me. I'm looking for the Katonah train. 
 Katonah, I think it's the New Haven line. 
 Why don't you try the information booth? 
 Katonah's on the North Brewster line, Track 117. 
 Downstairs. 
 You got about five minutes. 
 Thanks. 
 Whatever. 
 Virginia, something happened at home last night. 
 Mom? 
 It's Schilly. 
 Schilly died. 
 Oh, my poor baby. 
 You bitch! 
 You couldn't keep your hands off him, could you?! 
 Virginia, calm down. 
 Calm down. 
 The only thing my mother was ever faithful to was the bottle. 
 She drove my father away in a drunken rage. 
 He didn't even have time to say goodbye. 
 But once the dust settled, you and your dad... 
 We were supposed to see each other every weekend. 
 It's been his weekend for the past 10 years. 
 Still waiting to be picked up. 
 Where were you last night? 
 I went swimming. 
 On my way home I got on the wrong train, so I just decided to ride around for a while. 
 That's it? You just decided to ride around the city? 
 "The adventure begins with you." 
 That a Schiller line? 
 Did Schiller ever bring women home? 
 No. The only thing Schiller ever brought home was a suitcase small enough to fit in an overhead bin. 
 Was your mom giving Schiller a break on the rent? 
 No. But she was eager to provide him with all modern conveniences. 
 So they had a relationship. 
 Do you mean "capital R" relationship, or "little R" relationship? 
 The one that involves s*x. 
 "Capital R" relationship. 
 No. 
 Schilly drove her crazy because he never refused her directly. 
 His manners kept her hopes up. 
 She's not used to polite men. 
 So what was their relationship like? 
 Mom was jealous of Schilly. 
 Jealous of his life. 
 His freedom. 
 And he wasn't saddled with a kid. 
 This underwear look familiar to you? 
 Mommy's. 
 She always wore the good stuff when she wanted to get lucky. 
 Fat-lot of good it did her this time. 
 Guys, this is Virginia. 
 Hiya, Ginny. 
 Virginia. 
 Virginia, Detectives Munch and Cassidy are going to take you home. 
 Can I drive? 
 Since you're probably as old as my partner, I don't see why not. 
 What? 
 Cool. 
 She's tough. 
 She's just like Maureen. 
 Drama's a major food group for teenage girls. 
 Seven tenants in the past five years. 
 Only one still left in Manhattan. 
 As The Vinyl Turns 239 Bleecker Street Tuesday, October 12 
 Constantly touching me. 
 Even when I specifically asked to be alone, she'd find some excuse to bother me. 
 Dropping off the mail, leaving me cookies and milk. 
 I'm lactose intolerant. 
 Were you ever romantically involved with Mrs. Hayes? 
 No. No, no, no. 
 And uh, how did she react when you turned her down? 
 I had a friend come home with me once, pretend she was my girlfriend, thinking that would get Mrs. Hayes off my scent. 
 But Mrs. Hayes just tore into us. 
 Then she threw my friend out, and then she literally read me the lease. 
 "No overnight guests without permission." 
 Why'd you stay? 
 I was in grad school. 
 I was broke. 
 It was a nice place, but it's like when I travel... 
 I'd rather stay in a hotel than one of those "charming B and B's." 
 I prefer anonymity, solitude. 
 I hate making small talk over, you know, tiny blueberry muffins. 
 Home Of Annabel & Virginia Hayes 2001 East 9th Street Tuesday, October 12 
 Do you know how Mr. Schiller died, Mrs. Hayes? 
 I know that his mouth was taped shut, and he looked like he was ready to hit a home run. 
 And when you came home, no one else was here? 
 No. I told you no before. 
 People aren't going to magically appear. 
 What are you getting at? 
 When you found the body, Mrs. Hayes, did you touch it in any way? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I collected next month's rent. 
 Of course I didn't. 
 Then explain how a pair of lacy underwear was found in Mr. Schiller's mouth. 
 I have no idea. 
 Maybe it's some weird s*x thing, I don't know. 
 Did he have a history of taking your underwear? 
 Who said they were my underwear? 
 Not that I know of. 
 But how well do you ever really know someone? 
 Let's get back to the underpants. 
 Mrs. Hayes, they didn't just magically appear in the back of your tenant's throat. 
 Maybe they crawled down. 
 You were angry because Schiller wasn't interested. 
 I wasn't. 
 You were angry because he kept his hands off you. 
 You wanted more. 
 I didn't. 
 Not now, I didn't. 
 There was a time, yes. But... now I have a boyfriend. 
 At least I think I do. 
 A boyfriend? 
 Tom. 
 He works in a department store. 
 Gets me a great deal on expensive underwear. 
 When was the last time you saw Tom? 
 Last night. 
 We uh, we met for drinks. 
 Had a fight... about Schiller, of all things. 
 He thought that there was something going on between us. 
 Why didn't you tell us this before? 
 Tom once told me that he loved me. 
 That's worth a lot. 
 You think he might have done this? 
 I hope not. 
 You two met for drinks, where? 
 Julian's Bistro. 
 65 St. Marks. About 6:00. 
 Can you give us your boyfriend's full name, please? 
 Thomas Dayton. 
 Tom Dayton is a happy hour regular. 
 Nice guy, only this time he brought a date. 
 Why is that memorable? 
 They got into this huge blow-up about my tip. 
 She wanted to leave more, he wanted to leave less. 
 Then all of a sudden, it was she loved him more, and he loved her less. 
 Can I get you anything else? 
 No, thanks. 
 I try to stay out of these things. 
 Did they leave together? 
  No. 
 She nursed a couple of manhattans for a while. 
 I told her she was better off without him. 
 Women are always better off when left to their own mechanical devices. 
 I'm sure you know what I mean. 
 Uh-huh. Yeah. 
 That's him over there. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, you're welcome. 
 Tom Dayton? 
 Do I know you? 
 Detectives Benson and Stabler, Special Victims Unit. 
 This is about Richard Schiller. 
 How long have you been dating Mrs. Hayes? 
 Six, seven months. 
 She's really serious. 
 And you? 
 Loving someone who expected more of life is a big responsibility. 
 I'm also not sure I'm ready to be a father to a teenager. 
 Trust me, you're never ready for that. 
 You have kids? 
 Yeah. 
 Lucky man. Teenagers. 
 I know their fashion sense. 
 I have to. It's my job. 
 But Virginia's a little hard to read. 
 Mrs. Hayes said that you and she had a fight the night Schiller died. 
 It was about Schiller. 
 That's where all our fights began. 
 You think she and Schiller were having an affair? 
 No, he was packing for his next big trip. 
 She couldn't stop talking about him. 
 But, typical male, I overreacted. 
 I don't have any proof of anything. 
 Where'd you go after your fight? 
 I came back home alone. 
 Anybody see you? 
 The doorman. 
 I was tired, had to get up early. 
 I've been doing a lot of overtime. 
 Homecoming, you know. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 They get in a fight, Dayton leaves, he goes to the Hayes house, he kills Schiller. 
 It would make more sense, assuming he's strong enough to take Schiller on. 
 Why do you think Mrs. Hayes didn't tell us about Tom Dayton before? 
 Haven't you ever tried to protect someone you love? 
 Hey, that's mine. 
 Dad, it's for you. 
 Yeah. Stabler. 
 Yeah. Okay, I'll meet you there. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Why don't you go on to dinner? 
 I'll meet you for dessert. 
 Yeah. 
 Sure, you will. 
 All right, everybody knows the drill. 
 Love you. 
 Love you, too. 
 Love you. 
 You wash your hands? 
 Good one. Love you. 
 Love you. 
 Love you. 
 Dad, not on the lips. 
 
 
 
 When did that happen? 
 When you were at work. 
 He's dead. 
 Thomas Dayton. 
 Died in '87. Car crash. 
 I wonder if Thomas had a sibling. 
 There, older brother Scott. 
 Apparently a close family here. 
 Scott seems to have borrowed his brother's social security number. 
 Scott Dayton. 
 Scott Dayton, convicted two counts child molestation. 
 October, 1990, Seattle. 
 Seems he liked to work with his hands. 
 It wasn't Mrs. Hayes he wanted to keep all to himself. 
 It was Virginia. 
 See, we just pull this up, take that in. 
 See how that looks? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a great color. 
 You know where we might find Scott Dayton? 
 You all right? 
 Yeah! Get him! 
 I was just trying to do my job. 
 That's exactly what we were afraid of. 
 Hear you have quite an eye. 
 - I enjoy my job. 
 I'll bet you do. 
 Back to school's probably your favorite time of the year, huh? 
 All those poodle skirts? 
 I work hard to meet tight budgets, to make an awkward teenager look her best. 
 Yeah. I bet you suggest a lot of alterations. 
 Well, they're often needed. 
 A perfect size... 
 Oh, please. 
 I was trained as a dressmaker. 
 It's what I'm good at. 
 You give it that personal touch, huh? 
 Yes, it involves touching. 
 Any touching at all, regardless of my history, is taboo in this frostbitten country. 
 I'm guessing that Mrs. Hayes is one of those crazy women who doesn't bother running background checks on their boyfriends. 
 Does she know? 
 Know what? 
 I didn't kill... 
 Know that you're a convicted pedophile, Scott. 
 No. 
 When I was released, I wanted a clean start, which when you're a convicted s*x offender, you can never have. 
 And when I met Annabel, I honestly thought we had a chance. 
 We have a normal s*x life. 
 Three times a week. 
 Probably because every time you were thinking of Annabel's daughter. 
 No. 
 What did you do to her? 
 I never touched Ginny. 
 Virginia! 
 I've learned to control my impulses. 
 I've been in therapy... 
 You touched her. 
 Even if I'd wanted to, which I didn't, I never had the chance. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I mean, the two of them, they'd sit there at the dinner table flanking Schiller, tossing their hair and gabbing at him. 
 It was a marathon attention-getting contest, Virginia and her mother. 
 And Virginia won. 
 So, what you're saying is that Schiller was the pedophile. 
 Yes. Definitely. 
 Schiller? 
 I saw the way he'd look at her. 
 And I know that look. 
 And that made you jealous. 
 So much so that you did something about it. 
 No. 
 He was so good at chatting her up, you decided to shut his mouth. 
 I didn't touch Virginia, and I didn't kill Schiller! 
 You lied to Annabel Hayes! 
 I'm a different person now! 
 Who still gets jealous of the affections of a little girl. 
 You know, I'm surprised you didn't ask Annabel to marry you! 
 Then Virginia'd be Daddy's little girl! 
 Elliot! 
 Sometimes enough is enough. 
 No, it's not. It never is. 
 It sounds like Dayton pulled his life together. 
 He got a regular job. 
 Yeah, he works in the juniors department. 
 It's hard to change careers. 
 We don't have any hard evidence that Dayton did anything. 
 He steals his dead brother's social security card. 
 He evades his parole officer. 
 This guy will lie through his last breath. 
 Why do you think he's shifting blame on Schiller? 
 He blames Schiller for everything he's feeling! 
 You know, I'm getting a headache. 
 We have a convicted pedophile saying he didn't molest anybody, and a dead guy who wasn't a pedophile who might have. 
 And maybe Dayton's telling the truth. 
 Why? Because pedophiles are always so honest? 
 Ask the girl. 
 Where is she now? 
 Over there. 
 Hi. 
 Whenever Mr. Dayton would stay with my mom, he'd come into my room late at night... whenever she'd fallen asleep or whenever she passed out, whichever came first. 
 He would come to me when he didn't get what he wanted from her. 
 I'd pretend I was asleep... but he always woke me up. 
 Virginia, I know this is hard, but we need to know. 
 Did he force you to touch him? 
 That's not all, is it? 
 Oral s*x? 
 Intercourse? 
 I finally asked him to stop. 
 That's when Richard heard us. 
 And a few nights before he died... 
 Richard came into the room and shoved him off of me. 
 And Richard told him that if he caught him in my room again that he'd kill him. 
 You came home that night, didn't you? 
 Yeah. 
 I found Richard, and I knew what had happened. 
 He died trying to protect me, and I freaked out. 
 I ran to the train station and I stayed there all night, watching the board that posts the arrivals and departures. 
 I just wanted to leave so, so bad. 
 Why didn't you? 
 I didn't have anybody to go to. 
 Your mom says sometimes you borrow her clothes. 
 The underwear. 
 Were you wearing them that day? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mom hates it when I do. 
 But it's just, I don't know, it's so nice. 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 I didn't want to get in trouble. 
 I hid 'em in the hamper after my shower. 
 When did you find Schiller's body? 
 After my shower. 
 Approximately what time? 
 I don't now. 
 6:00. 
 What position was the body in? 
 I always said hello after swimming. 
 I swim and I swim, and I take 40-hour showers, and I never feel clean. 
 People like Dayton are habitual. 
 Ticking clocks. 
 It was only a matter of time before he watches someone else. 
 I'm just sorry it had to be Virginia. 
 I think we have enough to hold him over. 
 After I make a new copy of this. 
 Uniformed officers went over the house twice. 
 They never found the weapon. 
 Dayton had plenty of time to get rid of it. 
 Why didn't Virginia tell us up front that she wore those underwear? 
 She said she didn't want to get in trouble. 
 She couldn't remember what position Schiller's body was in when she found him. 
 She goes in, she realizes he's dead. 
 Adrenaline rush kicks in. 
 Come on, you never forget that. 
 When I asked her about Schiller's body, she started up the tear factory. 
 Well, what did you expect? 
 How about a straight answer? 
 What's going on? 
 Anybody who's seen a Tori Spelling movie-of-the-week could've given the same performance that Virginia did. 
 I would think you, of all people, would be on her side. 
 Every scenario has different interpretations, okay? 
 Let's just try this one on. 
 Virginia fled the scene of the crime. 
 She was scared. 
 And OJ Simpson was taking an afternoon drive? 
 Same facts, different interpretations. 
 All right. 
 People, if you need more time to read the menu, I can come back. 
 Schiller had s*x just before he was killed. 
 M.E.'s found secretions on him. 
 And what about on the underwear? 
 A match. 
 Tom Dayton never touched her. 
 Virginia and Schiller. 
 Afraid so. 
 He raped her. 
 There's another possibility. 
 Virginia was aroused. 
 Okay, a couple of scenarios... 
 One, mother walked in on them, flew into a rage, killed him. 
 Two, mother's boyfriend walked in on them, flew into a rage, killed him. 
 Three, Virginia flew into a rage, killed him. 
 No. 
 Everybody has their breaking point. 
 No way in hell are you talking to my daughter again. 
 Filling her head with all that garbage... 
 Fine. 8:00 a.m. Tomorrow, we want to see you, your daughter, and your lawyer down at the station. 
 Tell me, Virginia, does killing a man make you feel all grown up? 
 Maureen has a boyfriend. 
 One that she probably kisses on the lips. 
 Do you know who he is? 
 Jim. Jim Delmonico. 
 Little Jimmy? 
 "Little Jimmy" is six foot with a voice to match. 
 He's a junior. 
 Fullback, first string. 
 And he's asked our daughter to Homecoming. 
 "Little Jimmy's" a junior? 
 You'll probably run into him. 
 They do a lot of studying together. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 Oh, El, relax. 
 Has Maureen had s*x yet, do you know? 
 God, I hope not. 
 I wonder how we will know. 
 If we'll know. 
 No, hey, Munch, she's, she's a child. 
 Yeah, but the appeal stretches way beyond a mid-life crisis. 
 The way a halter top shows off a flat stomach. 
 The mature discussions you can have about The Backstreet Boys. 
 Come on. Everyone knows women mature faster than men. 
 It's true that a good Mrs. Robinson is hard to find. 
 But women maturing faster than men? Conspiracy. 
 The government's been covering up the harmful side effects of RBGH, a hormone that farmers use to produce more milk. 
 Like... like McGwire taking Creatine to bulk up, right? 
 The farmers don't take the hormones, Cassidy. Their cows do. 
 So is there anything that you just accept? 
 Yeah. 
 Stabler. 
 Compliments. 
 No wonder you're so skeptical. 
 We'll be down. 
 Virginia's in the hospital. 
 She tried to commit suicide. 
 When was she admitted? 
 About 7:00 this morning. 
 Luckily, she only cut one wrist. 
 Is she gonna be okay? 
 Yeah, she'll be fine. 
 Fortunately, she didn't lose much blood. 
 It doesn't sound like it was a serious attempt. 
 Serious enough. 
 It's been my experience that teenagers that want more than attention usually end up dead. 
 This is all your fault. 
 I've lost the most important thing in my life. 
 Mrs. Hayes, Virginia's going to be just fine. 
 I meant Thomas. 
 You poisoned him against me! 
 Easy. 
 You self-important bitch! 
 The mother's threatening to sue the entire department. 
 Lost wages, hospital bills. 
 Add a couple of zeroes for a broken heart. 
 Mother's an alcoholic. 
 In no way does that justify you tearing into a little girl. 
 What happened to the kid-gloves? 
 If she was a kid, I would've used 'em. 
 She is a kid. 
 Chronologically, yes. But in no way is Virginia Hayes a child, and probably not a victim either. 
 And Mrs. Hayes? 
 Drunks are always victims in their own minds. 
 But there was a relationship between Virginia and Schiller? 
 Right? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Come on, people. 
 We don't know. What it was. 
 They had s*x. 
 A girl tried to kill herself. 
 She's overwhelmed emotionally. 
 Or she was cornered. 
 You think she killed him? 
 I do. 
 I'm still not ready to take that leap. 
 Do I hear self-defense? 
 Look, we're gonna have to work this out, okay? 
 So, once we get that taken care of, we will... we'll call you. 
 I can't wait. 
 Neither can I. 
 The mom had a revolving door of boyfriends. 
 Virginia learned at an early age that men were just a commodity. 
 That, and as arcane as it sounds, there is some truth to the notion that every girl wants to marry her father. 
 Most of them outgrow it. 
 When a father is absent, it is not unusual for a younger girl to be attracted to an older man. 
 That's what this is about? 
 It happens a lot more than you think. 
 How old were you? 
 Almost 17. 
 And he was? 
 Older than 17. 
 About as old as I am now. 
 And I'll tell you something, I couldn't have loved him more. 
 I don't care how you look at it, it's an unequal relationship. 
 Being in love, that does not absolve an affair. 
 I'm not saying that love is ever an excuse. 
 I'm saying that soul mates come in all shapes and sizes and ages. 
 Soul mates? 
 Come on, Olivia. 
 Elliot, she didn't remember the position of the body. 
 Have you ever seen that? 
 What are you trying to protect in her? 
 Her. I'm trying to protect her. 
 No, you're trying to protect your daughter, and you can't. 
 Don't bring her into this. 
 Maureen, you look terrific! 
 You look great. Okay, just one more one more, one more. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 Nothing. 
 Here. 
 Thank you. 
 Mom. 
 Here. 
 Okay, let's have a picture by the fireplace, you two. 
 Sweetheart, can you get out of the picture? 
 Okay, one more and... 
 Mom, we do have to go, so stop. 
 Oh, yeah, okay. 
 Say good night to 'em. 
 Okay, you look great. 
 All right, have fun. 
 Night, Jimmy. 
 You look beautiful tonight, honey. 
 Good night, Dad. 
 Good night. 
 Don't wait up for me. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Home Of Annabel & Virginia Hayes 2001 East 9th Street Friday, October 15 
 Virginia? 
 I'm upstairs. 
 You wanted to talk to us? 
 Thomas Dayton never touched you, did he? 
 Tom... 
 No, he didn't. 
 It was Schiller? 
 He raped you? 
 Tell us. 
 It changes everything if Schiller sexually assaulted you. 
 I wouldn't call it assault. 
 We need to hear it in your words, Virginia. 
 How did it start? 
 Schiller would tell Mom and me stories about his travels. 
 We'd sit up late at night in the kitchen, listening about places that had names like Kuala Lumpur and Burkina Faso. 
 When did it get sexual, Virginia? 
 July 17th. 
 It was raining. 
 Mom wasn't home. 
 Schiller and I ordered Ethiopian food. 
 It was delicious. 
 Then what happened? 
 I kissed him. 
 That's how it started. 
 He coerced you? 
 No. 
 We couldn't help ourselves. 
 I had never felt that... pull before. 
 It's every man's fantasy, right? 
 Having some young girl want him? 
 But it was so much more than that. 
 For the first time in my life, making love felt natural... felt good. 
 For the first time I felt safe. 
 How long did it continue? 
 Months. 
 When he was home, he made this house bearable. 
 And when he would leave, I didn't think I was going to make it without him. 
 I cried every night he was gone. 
 When he came back... he promised he'd never leave me behind again. 
 When he was out, I would read his mail, and saw that he was going to leave again. 
 For Romania this time. 
 And? 
 I packed my bag. 
 I wanted him to take me with him. 
 He was sitting right there. 
 Tell me. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 I did... what he liked. 
 What was that? 
 I got on his lap and the chair leans back. 
 And when we were finished, I leaned close and asked him to take me away... 
 "You promised." 
 What did he say? 
 He said he needed to travel light. 
 And I knew I couldn't stay another day here without him. 
 Something broke inside me. 
 I didn't think. I put my knee on his throat and I held it there. 
 He made this wet hissing sound. 
 He couldn't talk. 
 And when he was still... 
 I picked up my underwear from the floor and I put it in his mouth. 
 And I left. 
 He had this drive, this impulse to travel. 
 Like you. 
 He'd always promised to take me away to a place where he would love me. 
 And I just wanted so badly to leave this life. 
 Oh, I miss him! 
 Yeah? 
 Tough day. 
 They're arraigning Virginia in the morning. 
 ADA's going for man two. 
 You okay with that? 
 Talk to me. 
 I have a child a little younger than Virginia. 
 When she was born, I used to take her to the playground and the grocery store... whatever. 
 But it wasn't her that I would watch obsessively. 
 It was the men all around... wanting to protect her from anything they might do to her. 
 Elliot... 
 The other night... her date comes to pick her up, and all I'm thinking is, what is this guy gonna do to her? 
 I know. 
 I made a mistake today. 
 I didn't see it. 
 Olivia saw it, but... 
 You got too wrapped up. 
 I saw that girl like I saw my daughter... as a victim. 
 Not as someone capable of... of acting, feeling... loving on their own. 
 Your daughter caring for someone doesn't mean she loves you any less. 
 I know that. 
 You want to be the only man in her life. 
 No. 
 Sort of. 
 Elliot... your feelings will always be a part of your police work. 
 Yeah, but I... 
 The more you try to deny that, the more control they will have over you. 
 We work with different permutations of s*x all day, and sometimes all night long. 
 Hey, don't worry when you feel something. 
 Worry when you don't.
