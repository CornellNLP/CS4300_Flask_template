 [Callie] Previously on The Fosters... 
 [Brandon] Callie is into me. We kissed at the wedding. 
 And that's why she ran away with Wyatt, because she didn't want to mess up Jude's adoption. 
 The only reason we're not together right now is because she needs a family more than a boyfriend. I don't belong here. Anyone else feel they don't belong here? I've terminated my rights  so you guys can get adopted now. I want to be a part of this family more than I have ever wanted anything in my whole life. She's over me. Sucks about Callie. You deserve better. I want to go back on my meds. Can we start over? We are trying to have a baby. Oh, my God. A baby? Maybe we should... ask Timothy. So you read the donor contract? I don't think I can sign it. Should have never inseminated before we signed that contract. I'm pregnant. Oh, my God. [man] You bribed him? I just wanted to make sure Dad didn't go to prison. For $10,000. What's to stop her from going to the DA anyway? Freakin' woman, I could kill her. You haven't seen Ana, have you? They saw her get into a screaming match with some guy. [Brandon] I just got a message, and he sounded super drunk. Donald isn't my dad? According to the birth certificate, it says Robert Quinn. [Callie] You're going to walk into that courtroom,  and officially become a member of this family. [Wyatt] If you're not going to be able to get adopted, does that change anything? [Callie] No, it doesn't change anything. What happened with the audition for the symphony? I got it. All I have to do is tell them you set her up, because I bought back the IDs. What IDs? The kids we sold to aren't going to talk. [Vico] I told you I was going to hit you where it hurt. [coughs] [grunts, pants] [grunting] [horn blaring] [gasps] [alarm buzzing] [alarm stops] [sighs] ♪ It's not where you come from ♪ 
♪ It's where you belong ♪ 
♪ Nothing I would trade ♪ 
♪ I wouldn't have it any other way ♪ 
♪ You're surrounded by love and you're wanted ♪ 
♪ Never feel alone ♪ 
♪ You're at home with me ♪ 
♪ Right where you belong ♪ Spaghetti and potato chips for breakfast? The baby wants it, Jude. The baby wants it. How's it feel? Pretty good. Hopefully we'll be done with that thing after today, right? Where's Mariana? We were supposed to walk to school together. She already left. Whatever. Peace out. Peace out. [Stef] Ooh! [mimics fanfare] Look at this. [Jude] Is that... ? Your birth certificate? Yes, it is! It is indeed! [kisses] Go show Mama. [chuckling] Oh, let me see! Let me see! Oh! Your hands. [chuckles] Let me see that. Oh, Jude. This is so great. So great. Oh! I just love you so much. I love you, too. That's awesome, bud. What is? I got my birth certificate. Oh, my God! That's amazing! All right, you guys. Let's get to court. I will pick you up for your doctor's appointment after lunch. Got it. Listen, please do not worry. You'll get a home run. Ok? Mm-hmm. Ooh! Ok, let's get out of here! [Dani] Sorry to ambush you like this. Your dad asked me to move in. You're moving in with him? Because I'm in love with him, and he's in love with me. You're in love with him? You're not even faithful to him. Wow. [chuckles] Really? Yeah. And you're keeping all sorts of secrets from him. I keep secrets from him because I love him. He couldn't handle it, Brandon. Look, I never told you this... but that night... the night that your dad found out about everything you'd been up to... when I found him, he was in really bad shape. He could barely talk he was so drunk. He had been in some sort of fight. He had blood all over his hands. He had blood on his hands? Look, I'm not telling you this because I want you to feel bad, I just want you to know how hard he took all of that. So before you get any ideas about coming clean with him, just think about what it would do to him if he found out that we... I mean, he could drink again, or he could hurt someone, or worse, he could hurt himself. Your dad needs me, and he needs you. So you got to get over what happened... and just let it go. So you are not Ms. Jacob's birth father? No. When I met your mom, you were about six months old. And she was with some... she was married to some guy named Robert Quinn for a little while. But... when he found out she was pregnant, he left. Callie, you gotta understand that... the first time that I held you, I felt like you were mine. And by the time you were finally old enough to understand, it just seemed silly to try to explain it to you. I mean, you were my daughter. That was that. I mean, what is a father, anyways? Is it the guy who got your mom pregnant and left? Or is it the guy who changed your diapers... and held her when she was sick? I was there for her first words and her first steps. Thank you. [Judge] I appreciate that Donald did raise Callie until the age of ten, and that certainly makes a strong case for his being her presumptive father, and therefore being able to terminate parental rights. But because Robert Quinn was married to Callie's mom, and because his name is on her official birth certificate, yet he never signed it. It's possible he never knew about her and did not, in fact, knowingly abandon her as a baby. So he needs to be notified about all of this. I know it's frustrating... ... but until there is signed consent from Robert Quinn, the adoption of Callie Jacob by Stefanie and Lena Adams Foster is denied. [gavel bangs] Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm looking for Brandon Foster, please. I'm his mother. He's right this way. Hey? Hey? Mama's here. I'm here, ok? He was beaten up pretty good, but the CT didn't show any internal bleeding or swelling in the brain. Ok, what happened to his hand? Well, that's our biggest concern. He has compound fractures. The bones are shattered in several places. He's going to need surgery. Shattered? He's a pianist. He just got into the junior symphony. Our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all. I've got an orthopedic surgeon on her way. Uh, thank you. He's gonna be ok. Baby, hey. Who did this to you? Who did this? Vico. [Orthopedist] Ok, thumbs and pinky together. And resist, good. Relax. How's the feeling? Any tingling, numbness? A little, but that'll go away, right? Hopefully. I mean, we could operate again but any remaining nerve damage is going to be hard to repair, and could potentially just make things worse. But the bones are nicely healed. You've got between 90 and 95 percent function. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Good, he'll be able to play the piano again? Like he used to, right? We hope so, yes. But we won't know until he tries. [dance music playing] ♪ Feeling right ♪ 
♪ Oh, what a life ♪ 
♪ I'm taking flight ♪

♪ I'm gonna shine like the city lights ♪ [Boy] Damn, yo. Heinz 57's looking good today. Heinz 57? [Boy] Yeah, you know that stuff you put on meat? Well, I want to put some of that on mine. [laughing] Nice. Hey, babe. What's up? Hayley's shorts, from the looks of it. No kissing at practice. ♪ I could fly you all around the world ♪

♪ Like the city lights ♪ This is nuts. We're gonna have to do this every day? I'm sorry, but we cannot afford the lease on the big gym anymore. Great, just great. Look, we have lost some major donors, and so until we can replace that revenue, we're just going to have to learn to share. Or if you prefer, we could always... cut the wrestling program altogether. I didn't think so. When are they starting the search for the new principal? I don't know, but until then, well, you're stuck with me. Have a good practice. ♪ Like the city lights ♪

♪ And just do what you want tonight ♪ 
♪ What you want tonight ♪ Guys, come on. It's our turn. Hey, man. A bunch of us are going to play paintball on Saturday. You want to come? Uh, just us guys, though. Ok? Yeah, cool. Sounds good. Oh, by the way, thank you so much for helping me out with that end kick. I just could not figure that out. No problem. I just... I really want to get it right, you know? Don't worry, you're doing great. Really? I am? You're getting a lot better... Oh, my God, thanks. Hey, by the way, your roots are showing. It's probably time for a touch-up. Oh! Yeah, I was... I'm going to do that tonight. Cool. [Mike] Hey. Hey! How'd it go today? Doctor, right? Yeah, you know, as good as could be hoped, I guess. Said Brandon's got about 95 percent function back and should be playing the piano again before long. So that good, right? Yeah, absolutely. Good, good. I mean, I'd asked him myself, but he barely picks up the phone for me anymore. [laughing] Yeah? And why's that? I don't know. He probably... thinks I let him down again. I mean, he did get beat up right outside my place, Stef. What are you talking about? You didn't know he was coming over. You can't seriously blame yourself for being asleep, Mike. Come on. Hey, Foster. No one on 17th has seen her. Ok, thanks. I appreciate you asking around for me. Sure thing. What are you doing? Why are you looking for Ana? It makes me nervous, not knowing where she is. I don't want her showing up out of nowhere, getting in touch with the twins or Brandon or something. After what happened last time, I just want to know where she is, ok? No, Stef. No, it's not ok. [sighs] I mean, she's gone. Just, can't you leave well enough alone? Do you really want to invite that mess back into our lives? And what if Captain Roberts or the DA find out you're looking for her? Don't you think it's going to look a little suspicious? They're not going to find out. How do you know? Just leave it alone, Stef, ok? Just leave it alone. [piano playing idly] So? You all cleared to play again? Yeah, yeah. They say I'm close to 100 percent. That's great. Yeah, I was worried things weren't going to work out when I came to see you in the hospital. [chuckles] How about you? How was everything at court? We all cleared for take off? Uh, no. We're not, yet. Yeah, they won't let me get adopted until we find Robert Quinn or until I turn 18. What? You're kidding? Uh, are you going to look for him then? No, I don't think so. Eighteen's not that far away, and it's just a piece of paper, right? I'm already a member of the family. Yeah, yeah. Of course. So we wait a couple years, then we won't need anyone's permission. [chuckles] Right. Oh, crap. Wyatt's going to be here like any second. I got to change. Can you... Would you mind letting him in? Yeah, sure. [doorbell rings] Come on in. Hey. So how's the hand? Oh, good as new. [chuckles] At least that's what they're telling me, so... Yeah. Um, Callie's changing. Cool, thanks. Sorry about that stupid judge. How'd Jude take it? He was pretty upset, but he definitely understands why I don't want to find this Robert guy. He does? I'm not sure I do. Look, there's got to be a reason my mom didn't want me to know about him. And I'm not sure I can handle any more surprises. I think I've had enough of those for like ten lifetimes. I feel you, girl. I just don't think I can open up another door, without knowing what's behind it. For once, I just want to... play it safe. [man] Daphne, you got a customer. Hey. You sure you're ok? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Would you be better if I kissed you? [sighs] That's cheesy! But would you? [whispers] Totally. Oh come on, y'all. People tryin' to eat around here. [Emma] Ok, since the math midterm is next week, I think we probably need an extra tutoring session. Yeah, probably. Or two, maybe? Yeah, sure. What about Saturday? Can you do that? Um, I actually have plans this Saturday. You do? We've got like a family thing. Oh, ok. Well then we should probably study some more tonight. I have to go home for dinner, but I'll come back later. Ok. Ok. Mariana, let's go. Dinner's ready, everyone's waiting. [Mariana] Ok, I'll just be a few minutes. You guys can start without me. Are you ok? You're not sick, are you? [door handle turning] No, no, I'm just... I can see. Sweetheart, is it really worth it? Oh, my gosh, you are so beautiful. Why do you need to do all of this? You know you spend hours and hours on it, and you're just damaging your hair, love. Mariana, I miss your old hair. Ok, well, I don't. Really? Really, I like it blonde. [scoffs] How about if we took you to a salon, and they got it back to brown... No! Be down for dinner in three minutes, or I'm going to shave your head. Hey, I think we have to lay down the law with Mariana. This is it. She is completely obsessed with her hair, and she's absolutely ruining it. I think we need to tell her that she's going to go back to brown, and that's it. Honey, we can't do that. Why not? She'll get mad, and she'll get over it. What's she gonna do? She's not going to just get over it. Not the way you think. It's hair, come on. Honey, to you it's hair. To me and to Mariana, it's more complicated than that. Listen. [sighs] When I was a teenager, I would've given anything to have straight hair and I did. I spent every last dime that I had, and then some, on chemicals and hot irons and Frizz Ease. Drove my mother crazy because she loved my curls, and she would try and try to force me to stop. But the more she dug in, the more I dug in. You know, I... I ended up barely speaking to my mother for the better part of my junior year, because it was that important to me. Honey, you got to trust me on this, ok? Ok. Thank you. And for the record, I love your curly hair. [kisses] Thank you. [Stef] Oh, speak of the devil. Hello, miss thing, nice of you to join us. Come on, you guys! Everybody, it's dinner time! Well, this is very nice, having everyone together. Yeah, I think we need to have more... [doorbell rings] ... of these all-family dinners again. I'll get it. Can we make a deal that everyone is home for Tuesdays and Thursdays and Sundays? Oh, and don't forget, you guys. Tomorrow, we have Jude's award ceremony. You guys don't have to come. I'm just reading my dumb essay. Dude, we're coming. And excuse me, this is not a dumb essay, it is your award-winning essay... Um, there's a social worker at the door. Hi, can we help you? Hi, there. I'm Elaine with CDSS. Hi, I'm Lena, and this is Stef. What's going on? Well, I'm afraid it's come to our attention that your license to foster has expired. What? Expired? We weren't notified of anything. We had been told that you were formalizing and Callie and Jude's adoptions, and then this afternoon we received notification that Callie's adoption has been denied? Well, yes. For now, but... Well, unfortunately, without a formalized adoption, and without a current license to foster, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take Callie from the home. How could they do this? 'Cause they can. This is how it works. I know, but... Honey, I am so sorry. I can't believe this. It's just so wrong. We thought the adoption would be long over by now. No, it's ok. It's not. But I promise you, tomorrow, we will get an emergency extension from the judge, and you will be back in your bed tomorrow night. There's nothing you can do? You can't cut us just a little slack here? I'm sorry. I could lose my job. 
 
 Ok, you ready? Where's Jude? Uh, Jude, what are you... what are you doing? I'm going with Callie. Oh, Jude, you don't have to do that. You're adopted, it's all fine now. I know. I want to. Jude, sweetheart. You're no longer a ward of the state, so you... you can't go. Hey, listen to me. It's going to be fine. I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be back before you know it, in plenty of time for your big speech at school tomorrow night. So there's nothing to worry about, ok? Ok? Ok. Ok. Oh! I got that. [Callie] Oh. I'm so sorry about all this. [door shuts] Right? [chuckling] And that's negative three, so... what's the root? There's no family thing on Saturday. I'm going to play paintball with the guys. I see. What guys? From the wrestling team. Ok. Are you upset? No. I mean, I wish you didn't lie to me about it, but you know, whatever. I'm really sorry about that. This won't happen again. You're not mad? [chuckles] I'm not mad. It kind of sucks, but I'm not mad. Look, ever since you and I started dating, well, I went from being one of the guys to Jesus's girlfriend. You're not just my girlfriend. It bites. It's just... I don't know. Everything's kind of changed. I know it's stupid, but I feel like I lost all my friends. And you know I don't hang out with girls, and now that the guys are treating me like a girl, well... It just sucks. [water running, turns off] So how many homes you been in? Foster homes, I mean. Oh, um, six, I think? Yeah. Seven, if you count this one. In how long? About six years. One a year, huh? That's too many. Sorry about that. That's gotta be hard. Not hungry? That's ok. It's pretty bad anyway. How about some dessert? I made cookies. [keyboard playing] [playing stops] Hey. Um, I was just... going over it, you know, before I... Hey, it's going to be ok. You may be a little out of practice, but you'll be back to 100 percent before you know it. I know. I'm ok, Mom. I just wanted to say goodnight, and I love you. And call your dad, please, he misses you. Uh, did he tell you... that Dani's moving in with him? Danni's moving in? [sighs] No, he didn't. It's his life, though I still don't understand why he didn't break up with her, but that's... none of my business, right? He did. The night, you know, the night of the dance. But then I guess he went out and got a little drunk... ... pretty loaded, actually, and I didn't know what to do, so I... ... told Dani, and she went out and found him. Why didn't you call me? Why do you think, Mom? So, yeah, um... he was all messed up. He'd been in like a bar fight or something, and Dani went out, found him, cleaned him up, and he's I guess been sober ever since. So you know now he feels like he can't stay clean without her. He was in a fight? What happened? I don't know. He had like blood on his hands, I guess. But that's not really the point, Mom. I feel like it's my fault. What? That he drank? Well, yeah, and the fact that he's back together with Dani. B, baby. You are not responsible for your father. Or for me or for anyone else. The only person that you're responsible for is you. [soft rock music playing] ♪ Run away, roller coaster ♪

♪ I regret, I had it coming ♪ You need the bathroom again? Uh, no. I'm fine, thanks. Ok, well, since you're a, you know, a flight risk, and they haven't got an ankle bracelet on you yet, I'm going to have to secure things. Never had anyone go AWOL on me, and I'm not going to start now. I'm a light sleeper. If you need anything during the night, just bang on the wall and I'll come unlock the door. All right, then? Sleep well. Good night. [door locks] ♪ I've tried to tell truths so many times ♪ So Vico took the plea, two years probation, Two years? Are you serious, two years probation? He almost killed my son. [Ada] I know, I'm sorry, but he has no record and a powerhouse attorney. At least he'll be out of your life. Excuse me. Excuse me, I need to see the judge, please. [man] He knows you're here. [bell ringing] So did I just hear Coach Spears right? You're quitting the team? Oh, yeah. Really? Yeah. I just figured wrestling was your thing first. I can always go back to volleyball, right? Right. Sure. So you feel pretty good about that? About quitting? Yeah, I guess. Ok. Good. That's it? That's all you're going to say? Well, what do you want me to say? I don't know. Thank you? Thank you? For giving up something that you love to make me feel better? Dumbass! It's not your job to take care of me. If I'm unhappy, that's on me. It's my job to fix it, not yours. I'm going to talk to the guys, tell them they're being jerks. And you are going to be there because you are not quitting the team. Hi. Hi. Much better. Oh, hell. God, I'm sorry.

The clerk said he left for the day. I'm sorry. He left? I've been sitting here all day? Are you kidding me? I know, I'm sorry. So what now? What... Unfortunately... Callie's going to have to stay in the new foster home for the weekend. - Oh, my God. [Stef] I know, I feel awful. You better tell Jude. Do I have to?

We can discuss your case on Monday. Your Honor, they have taken Callie out of our house. Please, please, help us. Help her. You owe her that at least. I appreciate this is a... Sir, you cannot honestly tell me that you have to get home, when you're letting Callie be ripped out of ours. Do you not understand what is happening to this girl? I'm sorry. Sir? You need to think very carefully about what you say next. You're on thin ice, my dear. Tomorrow, we've got chores in the morning, and then you've got to go to your group, right? All right, then. Knock on the wall if you need me. Sweet dreams. [door locks] Hi, Helen. Sorry to bother you so late. No bothers. What are you doing here? I'm here to get my daughter. Where is she? Hi. Hi, welcome home. Thank you. Oh, God, I hope that's the last time I have to say those words. Yeah. Hey. Oh. [laughs] Hi. I am so sorry I didn't get to see you read your essay. How'd you do? I didn't do so good. Yeah, you did, Jude. You did just fine. I just... without you there, I didn't... even feel like what I was saying was true. Oh, well, I'd like to hear it. [sighs] "What Anchor Beach Means to Me" by Jude Adams Foster. "My first day at Anchor Beach, I got lost. Getting lost is nothing new to me. I've been to five different schools in seven different grades and as soon as I learned my way around, I would be moved to a different one. Until I came to Anchor Beach. This is where I found my forever family. I think it's really cool that the symbol of our school is the anchor. Because before I came here I was always lost, always drifting from one home to another, one school to another. but now I have an anchor. When you're out in the middle of the ocean, you can be washed overboard and lost at sea. Once you have found your way into a harbor and dropped your anchor, you're safe." "So Anchor Beach is my safe harbor. Being part of a family, whether it's a real one or one like we have here at school, means you can be totally yourself, totally honest, because you're safe to do so. Actually, it means you have to be totally honest, because that's what family expects. I never thought it would happen, but I'm not lost anymore." Oh, buddy. Whoo-hoo! Hey, Callie. So listen we've got 30 days to get re-certified, and the Honorable Judge I-Want-A-Clean-Trail-On-This was not kidding. Yeah, so that's what we're gonna do. I promise you, we're going to get this taken care of. Wait, but there's something else. [Lena] What? I don't wanna feel like I can just get yanked out of the house whenever something happens. I think I need... ... I need an anchor. I think we should look for Robert Quinn... [soft rock music playing] ♪ The night is when the ghosts all come out ♪

They're still numb. And I don't... I don't think I'm gonna be able to play anymore. Have you tried? No, but what if I can't? I mean... Piano is... like the thing that made me me, you know? Look... What am I gonna do if I can't do it? Who am I going to be? We won't know until we try, alright? Come on. Ok. [hits wrong note] [hits wrong note] [exhales] I've played this... a million times, and it's not supposed to sound like that. B, you're just out of practice. No, I can't. I can't feel the keys.

Ok, all right. I will tell Callie tonight, then. Ok, great. I'll talk to you later. You bet. Thank you again. Mr. Watson! So this is Officer Adams Foster. She has a couple questions she'd like to ask you. Thank you so much for talking to me... So you saw Ana Gutierrez in an argument the night she went missing a few months ago? Uh, yeah. Ok. Do you remember the guy that she was fighting with? What he looked like? Um, sorta? He was, I don't know, average height, broad shoulders, dark. Maybe Mexican or Italian? Is this the guy? Yeah, this is the guy. That's him. Ok, great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. No problem. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Good luck. [Callie] So I decided we had to look for him. Smart girl. I just hope he doesn't turn out to be some crazy loser or something. [Daphne] Me, too, girl. Me, too. [sighs] Ok, so that's one vanilla milkshake and one root beer. That's going to be... [register beeping] ... $4.79. Here you go. Thanks. Hey, Callie, you want to go bus those tables? [chuckles] Thanks, Dad. You're welcome. Here. [engine starts]
