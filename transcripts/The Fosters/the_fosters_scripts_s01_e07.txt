 Previously on The Fosters...  
 This is awkward. 
 [Mariana] I don't have anymore money if that's what you mean. 
 [Therapist] Sarah we haven't heard from you yet. 
 I think my third foster home's a match. 
 The Olmsteads have really gone out of their way to make me feel welcome. 
 I saw your shots on Instagram. 
 [Callie] What do you want? 
 [Liam] I'm gonna say this once: Stop asking questions and stay the hell away from Sarah. 
 Do you think our moms are telling the Riveras they bought Lexi the pill? 
 What? 
 [Kelsey] Lexi wanted my help getting the morning-after pill  after she and Jesus had s*x. 
 I knew that you felt a responsibility to Lexi's parents because you are her Vice Principal. 
 I did it so that you did not have to. 
 How generous. 
 Mari, Jesus is gonna join us at church retreat next weekend. 
 Why don't you come? 
 What? 
 You're gonna let them spend the night together when you know they're having s*x? 
 Save it, Mariana, I don't want to hear it. 
 You're a freakin' tattletale. 
 You're like some hurt little girl on the playground. 
 "Jesus and Lexi had s*x and I feel left out, so I'm gonna tell on them." 
 It's the same thing you guys did to me. 
 Yeah, what world is that the same thing? 
 [Mariana] You guys were sneaking around behind my back, lying to me. 
 [Jesus] Because we knew you were gonna get your feelings hurt. 
 No. You knew what you were doing was messed up, or you wouldn't have been hiding it. 
 Don't lie, Jesus. You know it's exactly the same thing. 
 If that's the way it's gonna be, if we're keeping score now, maybe I should just tell moms who you've been talking to. 
 Jesus, shut up. 
 I think they'd be very interested to know you've been giving Anna money. 
 That would just get you in trouble, too, and you know it. 
 What do I care? What are they gonna do, ground me? 
 The only person I wanna see is Lexi, and her parents won't let her talk to me. 
 Sucks, doesn't it? 
 I haven't been able to talk to her for weeks. 
 Hey! That is enough, you two! 
 You guys are gonna have to figure this out. 
 For better or for worse, you're a family, and you're gonna have to find a way to get along. 
 No one on this Earth can get along with her, not even the Dalai freakin' Lama could get along with a monster like her. 
 I'm sorry to say this, babe, but you kind of brought this on yourself. 
 Drinking like that and outing your brother and Lexi to her parents was, uh, that was really none of your business. 
 I can't believe you're taking their side. 
 You might as well adopt Lexi. 
 You like her so much better than me. 
 That is not true and you know it. 
 We love you more than anything. 
 We just don't love the way you've been acting. 
 Is this really who you wanna be? 
 Hmm? 
 [pats Mariana] 
 [sighs] 
 * It's not where you come from * 
* It's where you belong * 
* Nothing I would trade * 
* I wouldn't have it any other way * 
* You're surrounded by love and you're wanted * 
* So never feel alone * 
* You are home with me * 
* Right where you belong * 
 [Sighs] So what's up? 
 Well, I got a call yesterday from Dr. Kodema. 
 The therapist? 
 From your group, yes. 
 And she expressed some concern that while you have been showing up every week, you haven't really been participating. 
 Yeah. Um... 
 I was gonna ask you, actually... 
 Yeah. 
 Can we, maybe, find another group? 
 Why? Don't you like Dr. Kodema? 
 Yeah, she's ok. 
 It's just... the kids. 
 I don't know, I don't feel... very comfortable. 
 Huh. Ok. 
 Well, I can talk to Bill about it, but therapy is one of the terms of your probation. 
 So until we can get something else worked out, you're gonna have to... 
 Keep going. 
 Yeah. 
 Ok. 
 Hey, do you want some? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Is there juice? 
 Are you, like, not talking to me or something? 
 No. Why? 
 I don't know, 'cause you're kind of not talking to me. 
 Hmm. 
 Did I do something? 
 I don't know. Um, you took my sister to a rager and got her drunk. 
 First of all, I didn't take Mariana anywhere. She took me. 
 She took you? To Wyatt's party? 
 Yeah. She was whining about being around when Lexi and her parents came over. 
 And second, I told her not to drink, and she ignored me. 
 So if you wanna be pissed at someone, take it up with her. 
 [toaster pops] 
 Oh. 
 Sorry. 
 It's fine, don't worry about it. 
 [sighs] I just thought that maybe... 
 Yeah, I know what you thought. 
 [Anna singing in Spanish] 
 * Arroz con leche * 
* Me quiero casar * 
* Con una señorita * 
* Que sepa bailar * 
* Que sepa coser * 
* Que sepa planchar * 
* Que sepa abrir la puerta para ir a jugar * [both laugh] You used to love that song when you were little. So how are you doing? A lot better. I've been clean for like a week now. That's great. Yep. And there's this place that I can go, this treatment center, to stay that way. Wow. The problem is, I can't afford it. I wish I could help, but I don't... I don't have any more money. No, if you don't have any cash, that's cool. I mean, there probably is something at your house, something that you guys don't use, something that your moms wouldn't miss. And then you can give that to me and I could sell it. I just really want to get better, you know? I, um, I don't think I can... It's just, we're family, you know, and family takes care of family. So I woke up in the middle of a dream about you, and I'm not gonna lie, it was kind of dirty, and anyway I was thinking things, and I went online to look at your sweet pics again but when I got there, your account was private. Yeah, you know, I just... I suddenly realized that, like, anyone can see it, you know. Don't worry about it. This doesn't have anything to do with that Liam douche, does it? I could tell he kind of freaked you out at the party and then I saw that comment he made on the shot of the tree. And I thought, "Is he flirting with her? Is he threatening her?" No. No, um, he was just kidding. Oh, he's hilarious, then. [chuckles] No. He's just got like a weird sense of humor, I guess. So who is he? How do you know him? Why? You want to date him? Yeah. Yeah, he's totally my type. So... He's just some guy I used to know. Ok? Hey. Have you seen Lexi? Sorry, babe. Have you heard from her, anything? [Bell rings] Oh, better get to class before you get someone else pregnant. I didn't... Forget it. [Teacher] And I think it'll be best if we work in pairs, that'll make it easier with two of you. So, everybody needs to pick a partner. Do you have a... ? No. Do you want to be mine? How about I come over on Saturday? My mom doesn't like it when kids come over. She says it gives her migraines. Yeah, ok. I mean, I have to ask, but... Ok. Well, let me know. [Teacher] Ok, everybody, back in your seats. [fast-tempo rock song plays] * Tricks and treats and fees and holds * 
* Buy you a diamond cut from coal * 
* But I can't and I won't * 
* Pick your posies, ring a rose * 
* Pavlov's pup gotta hit the road * 
* But I can't and I won't, but I might * 
* Ooh, I'm not a baby no more... * What are you doing here? You're not mad at me? Of course not. Oh my God, why would I be mad at you? My parents took away my computer and my phone and I couldn't figure out a way to reach you, and I just thought... Are you ok? It's awful. My mom cries every time she looks at me. [Scoffs] You're kidding? No. My dad hasn't talked to me since that night. Is this why you haven't been in school? Was that the, um... ? What were the Riveras doing here? They're pulling Lexi out of school. [Door closes] Oh my God. They shouldn't... they are completely overreacting. Are they? Because they're under the impression that you gave Lexi emergency contraception without their consent or knowledge. I tried to assure them that couldn't possibly be the case seeing as it's school policy that we do not administer so much as an aspirin without parental notice. But they seemed pretty certain. Did they... ? Are they planning on going to the Board? Not that they mentioned. But if they're angry enough to pull Lexi out of school... I hope you're happy. What? You've ruined her life 'cause you're so freakin' pathetic and jealous. What are you talking about? Lexi. They're sending her to a boarding school in Texas. All thanks to you. Way to take care of the people you love. Hey. I'm headed home, but, uh, you know, I could take the long way. I'm waiting for Wyatt, so... Oh. Cool. All right, I'll see you at home then. Yeah, see you at home. [Engine races, tires screech] I thought I told you to shut the hell up! I didn't... what do you... ? Your little boyfriend just sent me a threat online. Well, I wonder where he got that idea. What'd you tell him. I didn't tell him anything. Leave me alone. Ow! Liam, let me go. I'm not gonna warn you again. Stay away from me, and stay away from Sarah, and tell your freak of a boyfriend to keep his mouth shut or else... [Wyatt shouts] Hey, stop it! Wyatt, let him go! [both grunting] Liam, enough! [Brandon] Hey! Get... Hey! Come on! Hey! Get the hell out of here! [Engine races, tires screech] Stay away from Callie! If I ever see you again... Shut up! I told you to stay out of it, and now you've just made things worse. I was just trying to... Go home, Wyatt. Fine. You want me to stay out of it, I'll stay out of it for good. [Sighs] So you wanna tell me what that was all about? I mean, who was that guy? And why was he fighting with Wyatt? That was Liam. The foster brother you told me about? How old is he, though? I mean, he looks like he was... 30. He's 20. I guess he's 21 by now. I figured he'd be, you know, more our age. And how long ago was this? I mean, when you guys were together? Like a year or two. So he was like 19 and you were... That's not cool, Callie. You know that, right? That what he did wasn't cool. I guess. What's really not cool, though, is, uh, there's this girl, Sarah, she's younger than us, and she's living with his family, and, um, I'm pretty sure... I'm not sure you're listening to me here, Stef. My job could be in jeopardy. Ok, I hear you. But what I don't understand is why. I gave Lexi the pill, not you. Let's hope the Parent Board sees it that way. They're going to the Board? I wouldn't be surprised. But you didn't do anything. I don't... Yes, but you did. And everything that you do comes back on me. We're partners. I was trying to protect you, and I was trying to protect Lexi. She needed help. She's been like a daughter to us, Lena. Yes, but she's not our daughter, which is why we shouldn't have done it. Ok, I am sorry that things have gotten so messy, I really am, but I don't think I did anything wrong. Lexi would have gone to her parents if she felt safe enough to do so, and she didn't. So it came down to us. You didn't want to do anything... I couldn't do anything. I'm sorry. You couldn't do anything, so I did. I did the right thing. [Footsteps approach] Hi, honey. What's up? Hey. I can come back. No, no, no. It's fine. It's fine. We're fine. Ok. So, we have this assignment in school where we have to build a model of DNA or RNA. Uh-huh. Those are the things that make up genes. Yeah, I know. Oh. [Chuckles] So, we have to work in pairs, and I was wondering if my friend Connor could come over tomorrow. Oh. Is that it? Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Of course. [Stef] Hey, do you want a snack? It's gonna be a little while till dinner. I don't really like to eat between meals. Never met a kid who didn't like a snack. I'm glad he's making friends. [Sighs] Listen, I am happy to talk to the Riveras. No, absolutely not. Karina made it more than clear that I am not to engage with them at all, and that means you, too. This is ridiculous. It might be ridiculous, but this is my career, Stef. It is my career. You know what? Never mind. Never mind. We gotta start dinner. Mr. Rivera... I've got nothing to say to you. Then just listen to me. You've got a lot of nerve showing your face after what you did. I know. I'm sorry. We made a mistake. I wish I could take it back. Well, you can't. Come on. Haven't you ever made a mistake before? Yes, trusting you with my daughter. [Melancholy melody plays] * Grief is a freight train... * You know it's a bad idea to go to bed angry, right? Yeah, well, I gotta sleep sometime, so guess I'm out of luck. * Grief is a freight train * 
* Oh, what's a little pain when you've got so much to love? * Good night. * Forever is a slow dream * 
* Oh, what a vivid thing * 
* When you've got so much to lose * 
* Hope is a fast car only takes you so far * 
* Oh, you've got a lot to learn * [Doorbell rings] Uh, hi. Hi. Hi. Lena, the Riveras are here! Come on in. Hello. Is, um... is Lexi here? No. Are you sure? Yeah, the kids are all still sleeping. Why? Because when we woke up this morning, she was gone. She had packed a bag... and she was gone. So you haven't seen her? No. I just woke up. [Lena] Are you sure? Yeah, I swear. OK. Maybe... Should I go and look for her? [Stef] No, no, no. You stay put. But if you think of anywhere she might be, you let us know. He knows something. I don't think so. He's never been a very good liar. What's going on? Have you seen Lexi? Not since the other day. Why? She ran away. When? Sometime last night. We're not exactly sure. [Sighs] Well, I'm sure she hates me now, so I doubt I'll hear from her, but I'll let you know if I do. [Phone buzzes] __ It's not from her. I'm sorry. You know what? We can track Lexi's cell phone. No. We took it away. [Sighs] Ok. Um... [Clears throat] I think that we should file a police report. I really do. Let's look for her first. She's probably at a friend's house, or maybe she went to the school. Ok. Then how about, Ernie, you and I go looking for her. We'll check the school and the beaches, any of her usual hangouts. Sonia, you and Lena can stay here and make phone calls to her classmates. I have contact numbers for the whole school. [Stef] That way if she does come here looking for Jesus, one of you will be here to talk to her. Ok. Ok. [Strumming simple melody] Hey. How'd you sleep? Not great. So, I was, uh, I was thinking, maybe you should call Bill. Why am I gonna call my social worker? Well, you know, to tell him about Liam. No. It won't do any good. I mean, it'll be my word against his, and he'll just deny it. But, I mean, it'll at least be like a red flag or something, right? Here's the thing. Um, if I go in and tell Bill what happened, it won't just be about Liam, it'll to on my record, too. If I admit to having any kind of relationship with a foster brother, even a kiss, it goes in my file and I get put in the high-risk category. And if they decide that I am... you know, sexually volatile, then they could put me in a group home. And once you become one of those kids, you never get fostered again. I mean, that's crazy, though. It's the system. [Sighs] So what about Sarah? What? Nothing. I was just... Look, if you came in here to give me another lecture about what a horrible person I am, don't bother. I got the message. Now, excuse me. So she's not at the school. We'll check the beaches where the kids hang out, all right? Sounds good. I don't know why I'm checking. She doesn't even have her phone. Well, you never know, she might borrow one, or... We're gonna find her, Ernie. We're gonna find her. I promise, ok? Thanks. 
 
 She's just so stubborn. Most teenagers are. It's their job, I think. [Chuckles] Oh. Not Lexi, my wife. [Sighs] She gets so angry and there's no talking to her. She's not alone in that. Sending Lexi away, really? So, you don't... Of course she needs to be protected, but... So why are you? Sonia wants to send Lexi to live with her aunt, in Honduras. But I had to remind her why left in the first place. There's so much violence. Sending Lexi back there to keep her safe... [Sighs] well, that just doesn't make much sense. A boarding school was a compromise we could both live with. Ok. Ok, thank you. Thank you. Good-bye. [Phone beeps off] I know you're angry with us. [Scoffs] And I get it, I do. But I just... I wanted you to know that we didn't condone Lexi and Jesus having s*x. [Scoffs] And we taught our kids about safe s*x and about birth control, so I can't believe... And yet you say you didn't condone it? Look, the reality is teenagers have s*x. Dealing with that, it's... well, it's different than giving them a big thumbs-up. But why put those thoughts in their heads, why, when they're 15? Ok. Regardless of our differences, we should have never given Lexi that pill. And... I'm sorry. [Doorbell rings] Oh. Hey... come on in. Jude, Connor's here! [Sighs] So how's your Saturday? Pretty good. We won our soccer game. Very nice. Hey. Hey, Jude. The Beatles! It's a band that old people like. Ok, ouch. Why don't you guys head up to your room and get started. Jude has everything you should need. Come on. Hello. It's Mariana. I brought the stuff. Hey. Hey. [sighs] Thanks. Your parents were at my house this morning, looking for you. What did they say? Not much. They think Jesus knows something, but not me. You know, since we're not talking. I don't have to stay here too long, right? I don't know. It's up to you. I guess as long as I miss my flight tomorrow, well, maybe that will give my parents time to calm down. They seemed pretty scared. [Chuckles] This place is gross. Sorry. It was the only place I could think of at the last minute. No, I... it's great. So what's been going on with you? Well, I saw Anna yesterday. I thought you were done with that. I just feel bad for her. Anyway, she asked me for money, again. And then she said the most screwed up thing to me. She said, "We're family and family takes care of family." It's too bad they let Tomlinson go. They haven't been the same since. They were so close to the Super Bowl. Who's your favorite player? Oh. Uh... I like, you know, uh... what's his name? Actually, it's not mine. It's Jesus'. Oh, that's cool. Do you board? That's Jesus' too. Pretty much everything in here is Jesus'. Where's all your stuff? I don't really have that much stuff. When you move around all the time, things get lost or stolen. So this is pretty much it. Everybody has too much stuff anyway. I mean, like Zack? All he talks about is I got this new thing this weekend. It's stupid, right? He's such a jerk. Right? Hey, you don't ever talk bad about anybody, like ever. Even those guys who called you names and stuff, you never say anything mean about them. What's the point? We should probably get started. Oh my God! Hot! And give it to me. Model face. [Camera shutter clicks] Oh, my God, this is so Vogue, you being all hot in this dump. Ooh! That's a good one. Let me see! Oh my God, that's terrible. You have to delete that. Actually, I should probably delete all of these. Just in case someone sees my phone or something. So... What was it like? You know, having s*x, I mean. Well, you know how everybody says your first time isn't that great? Well, that's not exactly right. I mean, it's sort of great and... sort of awful and kind of weird, I guess. I mean, Jesus was super gentle... Ok. Mnh-mnh. You can't say his name. You're grossing me out. Sorry. He was super gentle, and... I don't know. It did make me feel really close to him. Are you guys, you know, gonna do it again? I don't think so. At least not now, anyway. [Sighs] I should probably get home. Are you gonna be ok here by yourself? Yeah. Thank you for... all of this. Hey, we may not have the best accommodations, but you're always welcome at Hotel Mariana. [both laugh] Here goes nothing. I told you to stay away from me. Look, I just need to talk to you, Sarah, just for a minute. Leave me alone. Can I show you something? It was my dad's. It doesn't open anymore, but I just like the fact that he carried it around. Yeah. Hey, what happened to your dad? He's in jail. Well, he was in jail, but then he had to leave the country and now he lives in, um, on an island. Oh, ok. He made a lot of money and some people got mad, so he had to leave. But he'll come back and get us. And he's gonna take us to his really nice house, and it's right on the beach, and there's a pool and these really awesome cars. And that's where all my stuff is at, at my dad's. Why are you lying? I'm not. You don't have to lie. I just... Sorry. Hey, you wanna play Ridge Racer? [Video game beeps] You go first. Whoa, this is  cool. [Car engines racing, tires screeching] I know that this is not something you want to hear, but we need to file a police report and we need to file it now. Time is everything and we need as many people out there looking for her as possible. Is something going on? Um, well, yes, I guess. Um, we didn't go to the police because, um... because we're undocumented. Wait, you're... Illegal. We are illegal immigrants. What's up? The Riveras are still here. What? Why? They're about to file a police report. Why? Lexi just ran away, right? I don't know. I think. I mean, she can't get in trouble with the police for that, can she? If they find her, that could be the least of her problems. [Door opens] [Mariana] Lexi? [Gasps] Wait. Why did you bring him here? You gotta come back with us. No way. I'm not gonna go home just so my parents can send me to some boarding school. You have to. Because your parents are undocumented. And there's something else. You're undocumented too. So I guess that's good, right? It sounds like they want to adopt me. I think that's very good, Alex. And I'm very happy for you. So who would like to share next? Callie? Would you like to? A little while ago, a year or two I was in a different foster home. And... I liked my foster brother. I mean, really liked him. It started out like no big deal. He was nice and funny and... and he paid a lot attention to me, which... that doesn't happen a whole lot. He even... he even used to hide candy bars in my bag, so that every day I'd got to school and open up my backpack and I'd think of him. And when we'd watch TV he would sit beside me and take my hand so that his parents wouldn't see. Or if we were alone in the house for a little while, he would tickle me or... [sighs] he told me I was special. I believed him. You are special, Callie. I may be. Yeah. But not to him. Sarah? Where are you... ? I'm sorry. Callie, stop! Sarah, wait! Liam told me you would do something like this. He doesn't love you, Sarah. He's just using you. You don't know that. Yeah, I do. 'Cause I used to be you. Look, why don't you come with me, ok? And we can tell.. If you tell anyone anything, I'll deny it. Everyone will think it's just you. That you made it up. Or you're in love with him, or you're crazy. It'll go on your record. Don't waste your time. It's just gonna come back on you. At least you tried. You did everything you could. Now it's up to her. It's her choice. No, it isn't. What? It isn't her choice. At least it wasn't mine. Um... [sighs] One night... Liam... he came into my room and he asked me to... you know? And, um... and I told him I wasn't ready. He... he forced me... um, he forced me to have s*x with him. I'm sorry. I always thought it was my fault. You know... but it wasn't. It wasn't my choice, and it wasn't my fault. [Stef] Look, I know it's scary, but I promise you, the only thing the police are gonna be interested in is finding your daughter. They are not gonna ask questions about your status. Ok? Yeah, ok. Ok. [Door opens] [Sonia] Oh, my God, Lexi. Where were you? - Where have you been? Mija. [Lexi] It doesn't matter where I was. I only came back because you're not sending me to boarding school. I don't know what Mari and Jesus told you, but we are... They told me that I'm undocumented. And so are you. And if you send me anywhere, I'll call Immigration myself. Oh, hey, sweetie. What do you, uh, what do you need? Connor's mom is here to pick him up. Oh, ok. Bye, Connor. We will see you again soon. I'll walk you... No, it's ok. I got it. Ok. Bye. Ok, I'll see you at school. Uh, wait. Here, keep it. I can't. Yes, you can. I mean, it's cool. I want you to. [Horn honks] Ok. See ya. [Door opens] [Door closes] Hey. So what do you think her parents are gonna do? I don't know, but I don't think she's going away any time soon. I mean, wow. Right? I had no idea that she was... Yeah, me neither. Did you see the look on her mom's face? Man, that Lexi's... she's a wild one. Well, you're the one who's, you know... You can't even say it. Say it. "Dating her"? No, I can't. So, you know what? Just take what you can get. Cool. [Soulful melody plays] * Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh * [Phone buzzes] __ * The atmosphere above * 
* Is a glimmer of what it was... * Oh, God. I'm so tired. I'm so exhausted. [Sighs] Seeing people scared like the Riveras were today, it really puts your problems into perspective. You don't think they're gonna go to the Parent Board, do you? I doubt it, but... If I had known how messy things were gonna get... I know. Me too. [Door opens, closes] Well, at least everyone's ok... for now. Hey, guys. Hey, where you been? Oh, I, uh, I took Callie to group. [Stef] That was nice of you. Did you share? I did. I'll let you guys talk. You can stay. Um, I have something I need to tell you. A little while ago, I was living with another family. Um, it was a pretty good situation, and they had a boy with... [Soulful melody plays over dialogue] * When the sky fell down *
