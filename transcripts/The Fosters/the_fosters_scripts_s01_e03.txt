 Previously on The Fosters... 
 After talking with Lena, we are not going to ground you. 
 And you should have talked to me about it first. 
 I... I don't wanna be some half-ass version of a dad. 
 Brandon has three parents. Period. 
 Hey. Hey, hey. She said no, man. 
 So you were looking for something permanent, for them? 
 And we want this to be your very last way station ever, ever, ever. 
 What's it gonna be, Kelsey? Where'd you get the drugs? 
 It was me. I did it. 
 Here. 
 [ringing] 
 Ok. Let's go. Time's up. 
 Mariana! 
 My turn. 
 Girls take longer. 
 No, no, no. But this isn't fair. 
 Get out. 
 Just gimme a second. 
 [Brandon] You're not supposed to be on the computer. 
 If Moms find out they're gonna ream me. 
 This sucks. 
 Yeah, well you shouldn't have been giving away your freaking pills. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 [bell rings] 
 About time. 
 Yeah. It hasn't been like 15 extra minutes of anything. 
 So. thank you for that. What are you doing? 
 I gotta pee really bad. 
 [shower running] 
 What? Jude! 
 I thought you were just... 
 [Jude] I'll be really fast! I promise! 
 If you wanna borrow something... 
 Uh, no. It's ok. 
 Ok. 
 I just thought you might be sick of wearing the same three things... 
 I'm not gonna steal your earrings. 
 I mean, what am I gonna do? Sell them at school? 
 Don't talk about things you don't understand. 
 Ok. Well, what don't I understand, Mariana? 
 I mean you stole your brother's pills, you sold them at school, and then you let your brother take the fall for you. 
 I never asked him to do that. 
 But you let him. 
 Buddy, can you do that in the bathroom like everybody else, please? 
 Come on. 
 What's that? 
 We are brown baggin' I for a little while. 
 [Stef] It's better for you. Go spit. 
 I don't eat cheese. 
 [scoffs] 
 Since when? You had pizza like two nights ago... 
 It's really bad for you. 
 Can I have tuna? 
 If you want to make it. 
 Mm. 
 All right, everyone. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Where's Brandon? 
 [Brandon yelps] 
 [Brandon] Cold! 
 Oops. I guess there's no more hot water. 
 * It's not where you come from * 
* It's where you belong * 
* Nothing I would trade * 
* I wouldn't have it any other way * 
* You're surrounded by love and you're wanted * 
* Never feel alone * 
* You're at home with me * 
* Right where you belong * 
 She spends like an extra 15 minutes in the shower I'm not even kidding. 
 It's like my turn and they... 
 Sounds like you guys need another bathroom... 
 Or four less kids. 
 I just want some privacy, really. 
 Yeah, well I don't think my parents are going out of town again any time soon, so I'm afraid you missed your chance for privacy, mister. 
 Well, we can figure it out. 
 How? It's not like we'll be alone at your place ever again. 
 Poor guy. How long is he in detention for? 
 All week. 
 Oof. That's rough. 
 What do you care? 
 I don't. I just feel sorry for him. What's with you? 
 Nothing, I just... look, I feel bad enough about it, ok? 
 Ok, but you really don't have to. 
 Think about all the times you covered for him. He'll be fine. 
 It's not like he ever pays attention in class anyway. 
 Look, Jude seems like a good kid... 
 He is. 
 But the Parent Board is all over me on this. 
 Obviously, we're ok giving you a little leeway, but he has to pass the proficiency exam that the other kids took to get in, or I'm afraid you're going to have to send him somewhere else... 
 I can't send him to another school. 
 He would be completely lost. 
 That's part of the reason he's so behind right now. 
 Because he hasn't had anybody to look out for him. 
 Look, I'm not unsympathetic, Lena... 
 The only sense of security this kid has in the world is his sister. 
 Separating them would be terrible for him. 
 Look, I'm trying to protect you here, too. 
 You know how this works. 
 Our funding is based on performance. 
 And now I have a new seventh grader who jumped the wait list, who isn't operating at even close to grade level. 
 Is it possible we could just give him more time? 
 Before he has to take the exam, I mean? 
 I know if I just had a little while to get him caught up I could... 
 Lena. He passes the exam on Friday, or he's done at Anchor Beach. 
 [Timothy] Now, he's guilty, insofar as he did commit the crime, But he doesn't feel that way until he actually gets caught. 
 Ok. I want everyone to write about guilt in their journals this week. 
 Wait, write? 
 Like with a pen? Like longhand? 
 Yes, like longhand. 
 And don't worry. No one's gonna read it. 
 It's just for you to get in the habit of writing every day. 
 [school bell rings] 
 Ok, guys. Seriously, I want you to write about whatever it is that you feel weird or ashamed or guilty about. 
 You'll feel better about it, I promise. 
 Weak, Foster. Very weak. 
 And quit "nudging" me online. 
 Hey, meet me tomorrow. 
 Meet you? Why? 
 You're in detention all day, remember? 
 I'm gonna have Douglas let me go to the bathroom. 
 So, two o'clock. I'll meet you by the lifeguard stand. 
 I don't know. I have to think about it. 
 Foster! 
 What? 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 What are you doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Talking to Lexi. What's the big deal? 
 No classes, no extra-curricular, no fun. 
 In school detention and home. Period. 
 But we've got a game this week. 
 Not my problem. 
 Jesus, you gave away your pills. 
 Do you not understand how serious that is? 
 This could have been a lot worse. 
 Use your legs, B. You're not using your legs. 
 The twins are both mad because Moms moved Callie and Jude into their room and not mine, so like everyone's all... everyone's all tense all the time. 
 [Mike] That's more like it. 
 Nice. You want some water? 
 Yeah. 
 So, I was thinking, maybe you might wanna spend some more time at my place? 
 Maybe even move in with me. 
 Why? 
 Well, you know I mean, the new kids in the house. 
 The place is busting at the seams... 
 I only get you the one night a week. 
 You're going be going off to college before too long... and I kinda feel like I'm missing out. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Could be fun. Why not? 
 Look, you don't have to say anything. 
 Just think about it and let me know. 
 You mind? 
 What? 
 The song. It's annoying. 
 You're in a good mood tonight... 
 I'm always in a good mood. 
 You're in a really good mood tonight. 
 Are you... is there someone you haven't told me about? 
 What? No. 
 Really? Nothing's going on? Nothing at all? 
 Nothing between you and Lexi? 
 Not at all. 
 That's not what it looked like this afternoon. 
 When? At volleyball? 
 We were just talking. 
 I was helping her with her kill. 
 [scoffs] With her kill, really? 
 What can I say, I'm irresistible... 
 Relax. You know I wouldn't date one of your lame friends anyway. 
 Right? 
 So, I won't be able to go to school with everyone else? 
 No, no, no. Honey, listen, all we need to do is give you the test, and once you pass it, everything's gonna be fine. 
 If he passes it. 
 Well, yes, but all he needs a 65 or better, and we're good to go. 
 You can do that, right? 
 This isn't fair. 
 No, it's not. But this is what I want to suggest, Jude, you and I are going to spend this week getting you ready, and that way you will ace it for sure. 
 Deal? 
 Ok, remember to convert to a fraction first. 
 Good. 
 Hey, B. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How were the batting cages? 
 Oh, uh, good, you know. 
 Yeah? What's up? 
 Uh, bud? I think we got some good work done tonight. 
 So, why don't you run upstairs and get ready for bed. 
 Night, Bud. 
 Night Jude, we'll be up in a minute. 
 What's up, babe? 
 Uh, um... 
 Uh, Dad kinda... asked me to move in with him today. 
 Wow. 
 Well, he never mentioned anything to me. 
 And I really think that he should have talked to me first. 
 Yeah. I guess. 
 Um. All right, well... don't worry about it. I'll talk to him. 
 Yeah, ok... 
 I said, I'd think about it. 
 Well, there's really nothing to think about. 
 I mean, it's not your choice. 
 It's not really your father's either, for that matter. 
 What do you mean, I don't get a choice? Why not? 
 Because you're, um... you're still a kid. 
 I'm 16. 
 Yes, that's exactly my point. 
 You're 16, you're not an adult yet. 
 [muttering] This is bull. 
 I'm sorry? 
 This is bull. I should get a say in this. 
 Well, you don't. 
 And we are done talking about this. 
 Oh, right. Ok, we're done talking about this. 
 Yeah, 'cause that's, that's your answer for everything. 
 Ok, let's just take a deep breath... 
 Right, B. Because you're a prisoner being held captive in this charming Craftsman in Mission Bay. 
 Stef... 
 What? 
 When did I ever get to choose anything? 
 Did I get to choose for you to divorce Dad? 
 Did I get to choose who I was gonna live with? 
 You were five! Come on. 
 How about choosing if I have two moms... did I get to choose that? 
 That's enough, Brandon. 
 Why? 
 Because I'm not doing exactly what you want me to do? 
 No, because you're being disrespectful. 
 Oh, I'm being disrespectful? 
 How about you have a little respect for someone else! 
 You need to stop talking right now. 
 Right, of course I do! Because that's your answer. 
 Anytime anyone disagrees with you, it's stop talking! 
 Be quiet! Do it my way! 
 You need to watch yourself, young man. 
 Watch this, Mom. 
 Brandon! 
 If you leave this house. 
 [Lena] Stef. Stef! Let him go. 
 He needs to cool down. 
 And so do you... 
 Are you gonna be up much longer? 
 I can't sleep with the light on. 
 I'm not just some selfish bitch, you know... 
 [Callie] Ok. 
 I didn't sell the pills for me. 
 It's not like I bought a new dress or something. 
 [Callie] Then why'd you do it? 
 For my birth mom. 
 Did you hear me? 
 I'm listening. 
 [television plays] 
 [door opens] 
 [television stops] 
 Where were you? 
 I went to Aiden's. 
 [sighs] You don't do that. You don't walk away. 
 I know, I know. I was just... I'm sorry. 
 I know. I'm sorry, too... for raising my voice. But that can't ever happen again. 
 You can get mad at me all you want to, but you are not allowed to walk away. 
 It won't happen again. I promise. 
 Ok. 
 And, and... for the record, I... I love having two moms. 
 That's good. 
 Um, you really made your point, Brandon. 
 I spoke with Lena and it's up to you... where you want to live. 
 You can stay here, or you can move in with your Dad. 
 It's your choice. Just let us know what you decide. 
 Well, don't stay up too long. 'Cause it's late, ok? 
 Ok. 
 All right, love. 
 You're back. That was some fight, man. 
 You heard that? 
 We all did. So what happened? 
 They're letting me decide. 
 Really? Wow. 
 I mean, moms are gonna be devastated if you go. 
 And my Dad will be devastated if I don't go. 
 You wanted to choose. 
 Good luck with that. 
 I just think, I mean, we're gonna get a lot more time alone. 
 I just hope my moms don't get too upset. 
 Brandon they'll be fine. 
 Really. You can go visit them, you know, whenever... with all those kids in the house I doubt they'll even notice. 
 Very good. 
 I thought you'd have a lot of guilt. 
 Good. Very nice. 
 Lose your pen? Ok. 
 Nice. Good. 
 [Timothy] Good. 
 I see some of us are still wanting for inspiration. 
 Tell you what, why don't you and Wyatt come see me after school today and we can see if we can get those juices flowing. 
 [students laugh] 
 That's not what I meant. 
 You're incorrigible. 
 Look it up. Every single one of you should know what that means. 
 Ok, turn to page 45. 
 So, we gonna talk about the elephant in the car or what? 
 Not much to say. You wanted Brandon to have a choice. He does. 
 You could've told him no. 
 I tried. It didn't go well. 
 Hey, can I have a breakfast burrito, extra salsa, please? 
 You got it. 
 Thank you. 
 So what, you just gonna be mad at me? 
 I don't know, Mike. 
 Do I wish you had talked to me about it first? Sure. 
 Would I have agreed to let B decide? Probably not. 
 So, maybe this is for the best. 
 But I'll tell you what you blind-side me with something like this again I'm gonna bury you deep in the desert. 
 Fair enough. 
 Sucks being blind-sided, don't it? 
 So, all of this with Brandon is just payback? 
 For what? Figuring out I was gay and leaving? 
 It's a little late for payback, Stef. 
 I think so. Mike, come on. 
 If you're gonna rehash our marriage for ten hours a day, I'm going to ask Roberts for another partner. Seriously. 
 Stef, it's not payback... it's regret. It's me growin' up. 
 I got a kid who's going off on his own. 
 I'm just trying to do something right. 
 [The Weepies: "Can't Go Back Now"] 
 * Yesterday when you were young * ♪ Everything you needed done ♪ * Was done for you... * Hey. So, Talya told me the news... Huh? You're moving in with your Dad? Yeah. Um, it's not... this might be stupid, but it's not because of me and Jude, is it? No. No, no, not at all. Just 'cause I mean, from what I can tell, you seem pretty happy in the house. Yeah. Hot water not withstanding. I am, I am. I mean, it's my house. It's where I grew up. So, why are you leaving? Hey, shouldn't you be in class right now? We are. Drama. Leslie wanted to make sure the posters went up today, so... How'd you get out of ISS? Oh, told Douglas that I had to take a leak. I should probably get back. Listen... Yeah? Thank you so much, for what you did. Telling Moms all that. You didn't have to do that. It's cool. I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate it. You really are the best brother... 
 
 * ... Be what you want to be * 
* If you ever turn around * 
* You'll see me * 
* And you and me * 
* Walk on, walk on, walk on * 
*'Cause you can't go back now * 
* Walk on, walk on, walk on * 
* But you can't go back now * Foster! Foster. Hey! So, what happened? Douglas wouldn't even let you out to use the bathroom? Well, then what? I was sitting there for like half-an-hour. I'm sorry 'bout that. "Sorry 'bout that?" That's it? I don't... I don't think this is a good idea. Why not? You know why... 'Cause of Mariana? Do you honestly think that she's gonna care? I know she is. She told me. Her brother and her best friend like each other, so? Most people would see that as a good thing. Yeah, well, she doesn't. We're just gonna do whatever Mariana wants? Try using those to write with. I don't think it's gonna happen, Timothy. Maybe we're just not writers. Have you ever heard of Joan Didion? No? She's a writer. Tough lady. Kind of a pill. She called writing, "a hostile act." A way of "imposing your will on the world." Now, I don't mean to point fingers, but... two of the three people in this room seem a little hostile. To me, anyway. The thing is, that sort of writing takes real courage. And you don't strike me as someone who is afraid of much... Come on. Come on. One line. One thing that's been rattling around in your head forever. [Timothy] One thing you feel terrible about. Get it out. Get it down on paper. And see what happens. [Boy: July] * Walked all these miles * 
* And now you're in the right place * 
* This is your party * 
* Everyone came * 
* Everyone smiling... * [Mike] Hey, Bud. Hey. Ready. Where we going? The Grill? No, my place. I thought I'd cook something tonight. Seriously? Yeah, seriously. It's not like I never cooked before. Unless it's pasta? B, I'd be very careful. Seriously, he cooked me a piece of fish once in 1997, I can still taste it. I'll have him back by nine. I know. * ... I'll hold your head my dear * 
* Make sure no one's * 
* Gonna wake you * 
* Tomorrow you'll still be here * 
* No matter where your dreams * 
* Will take you * 
* And do you realize * 
* All the falls and flights * 
* All the sleepless nights... * I'm gonna grab a snack. Do you want anything? * They brought you here * 
* They only brought you home * Oh, hey don't do that. Uh, we'll eat in front of the TV. I finally got the surround sound hooked up. Ok. Oh and hey... you know, if you move in, we could move that table out of the way, and you could put your keyboard and stuff there. Yeah, yeah, that would be... that's cool. Yeah, I mean, you know if... Right, yeah, of course. No pressure. Yeah. Hey what's... what's this? Oh, that? You like it? I made it. You made it? Yeah. That's the ship I was on when I was in the Navy. Yeah, I remember the name but... you made this? Good job, Dad. Remember, this is half base times height. I keep forgetting the formulas. Maybe I'm just not smart enough. Oh, honey. You are plenty smart. And trust me, I know smart. Considering you went to, what? Six different schools in the past four years, you're doing really great... Seven. Seven different schools. [sighs] [television plays] So, you still playing poker? Uh, no. How come? I mean I remember you used to brag all the time about milking those guys for beer money... Ah, you know... you do something for a while, people get busy then... I don't know. You just let it go. Too bad. It happens, kid.. I gotta get you home. I mean, I can text Mom. So, we can finish the movie. Yeah? Yeah. Ok. Hey, I got an idea. Let's play a game. Why don't you run up and grab everybody and get something out of the game closet? [doorbell rings] Hey, Talya. Come on in. Uh, Brandon's not here, though. Tonight's the night he has dinner with his Dad, remember? Oh, shoot. I forgot. That's ok. You're welcome to wait if you want. He should be here soon. And we're just about to play a game, if you'd like to join. Yeah, sure. Ok. Why don't you throw that stuff in Brandon's room. Hey, Callie! Hey... We're playing a game? Yes, we are playing a game. All of us? Yes, all of us. We used to do this all the time, remember? We just got out of the habit, and I think now that Callie and Jude are here, it would be fun to start the tradition again. I'm sorry, did somebody say, "Game?" Really? Mm-hm. You better get ready to lose, lady. She always loses. See? Fun. Fun! Fun for everyone. They're so much fun. I'm really gonna miss hanging out here. You know, now that Brandon's moving in with his Dad. Um, have you talked to him lately? 'Cause I just don't think that's happening. [indistinct chatter] [Stef] A boomerang? [Callie] A boomerang... Really, a boomerang? A weapon of some sort. Hey, bud. Hey. We just started, We saved room for you. You can be the top hat. So... I think I'm gonna move in with my Dad. Ok. Cool. All right. Um, before we get started, uh, does anybody want anything? I'm gonna get some tea. Do you want anything? [Stef] Ok. Hey. Hey. So, you're really leaving, huh? Yeah. Hey, uh, thanks for letting me use this. What are you doing? That wasn't a loaner. Really? Yeah, no. It's for you. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Just make sure you play it. So, I guess you decided you need more hot water, huh? Yeah. Well, thanks. Yeah. No worries. So, I'm gonna move the bed to that wall. Get like a couch in here or something. Just, really make this place a serious bachelor pad. Settle down. This is still my room. What am I gonna do without you here, man? It's just gonna be me and a bunch of girls. And Jude. Yeah. And Jude. You'll be fine. Just stay out of trouble. Yes, you. Stop giving out all your pills to every cute girl in school, for one thing. It wasn't me. What? It was Mariana. You're joking, right? She wanted to have some money to give to our birth mom. What the hell, man. What are you doing? Why would she do that? And why would you take the blame for her? Mariana asked me to go with her to tell Moms what she did. She was just about to say something. I looked over at her face, just at her stupid, scared face. It looked just like it did when we moved into our first foster house. And I couldn't let her do it. I mean, everyone's always mad at me all the time anyway. So, I figured, what does it matter? But at least it's over. All of this being grounded, and In-School Suspension... it was totally worth it, now that she knows what a loser our birth mom is. I mean, you know some day you're gonna have to let Mariana fend for herself. [Mariana] I never touched it! [Callie] Why would you do that? Good luck with those two. [Callie] It was moved! No one else has even been in here! I never touched it! Hey! Enough shouting! What is going on? She read my journal. No, I didn't. Well, somebody did. I left it right here second from the bottom and when I came back, it was moved. Well, it wasn't me. Mariana, tell me the truth... I am! I never touched it. Ok, Callie is it possible that it wasn't really moved? That you just think it was? Why? Because Perfect Mariana could never do anything wrong? Yeah, maybe you should get to know your daughter a bit better. [Lena] Wait, what does that mean? You know what? Forget it. Don't worry about it. You're probably right. It was probably my fault. I just forgot or something, probably. I can't live with her. Well, you have to. So, figure it out. Why'd you have to get so mad? Why can't you just get along with her? She read my journal. What do you care? It's just a stupid journal. See for yourself. You wrote about Liam? He said he wants a hostile act... Time's up, Jude. You all done? I'll correct it, and I'll let you know. I only need a 65 and I can stay, right? Yes... listen to me. Whatever happens, I'm really proud of you, ok? Go on, get to class. I'll come find you later. [Joshua Radin: Cross that Line] * Every time I lose myself I find * 
* I'm left alone * 
* But you need to know * 
* For you I'd break these walls * 
* I'd choose to fall * 
* I'm going to cross that line for you * 
* The sun is down * 
* I thought you'd be gone by now * 
* Didn't you? * 
* Autumn night * 
* I watch your face in the firelight * 
* And I say to you * 
* I'm going to cross that line for you * 
* I don't know the right way * 
* Wonder what you'd say * 
* If I let go * 
* For you I'd break these walls * 
* And I'd choose to fall * 
* I'm going to cross that line * 
* For you tonight * 
* For you I'd break these walls * 
* I'd choose to fall * 
* I'm going to cross that line for you * [thumping noises] What's that noise? Brandon. Brandon? Playing basketball? Oh, boy. He hasn't done that since he failed that final. I think he's feeling guilty. About what? About leaving us? About leaving you. Oh, please. Go talk to him, Stef. What am I supposed to say? He wanted a choice, he got a choice. He made a choice. I'm doing the best I can... That's not good enough. What do you mean? You don't get to do this. Do what? You don't get to have hurt feelings and pout. I'm not. Yes, you are. You have to step up. You have to go help your son. You have to put away whatever it is you might be feeling, and be the better person. 'Cause that's what parents do. Oh. Lucky. Oh, please. I've been known to shoot a basketball or two, my friend. You and Dad were such jocks. What happened to me? Oh, come on. You got the more important stuff. You're funny and smart and talented as hell. And more than that, you're kind. And you know who you are. You know what makes you happy. That's an amazing thing for someone your age, B. Don't take that lightly. Just do what makes you happy, B, ok? You do that and I'll be fine, I promise. That's the way it works. You don't, have to take care of me or your Dad or Lena. It's the other way around. [Stef and Brandon playing basketball] I didn't read your journal. I know you don't believe me, and that's fine. I mean, why should you? I'm just the latest girl you've been forced to share a room with. I remember what that was like. Being passed around all the time. I don't think I ever felt safe until I got here. It took me a long time to trust anybody. So, I get it. But I didn't read your journal. [Mike] Yeah, comin'! Hey. What's going on? I thought we weren't moving you in till tomorrow? Um, yeah, um... about that. You ok? Yeah... I just. I, uh, I can't... You can't what? Move in with you. Ok. I just, I'm sorry. It's ok! I just, I can't leave Mom... and everybody else. Don't worry about it. You sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah, Look, listen... this was never supposed to be a bad thing. You do what you gotta do. I'm gonna be all right. I mean it. Ok? Is that a, uh... is it a piano? Oh yeah, yeah. I rented it. But it's fine. You can come play whenever you want. I'm sorry. Oh, about time. [Lexi] Sorry my parents wouldn't let me come. Hurry up. We've been waiting forever. Ok, we were making popcorn. Unless, of course, you don't want any? I don't think they want any. We'll just have this for us. I'll take some. Come on... All right, ask nicely. [Stef] Pass that down. Here we go, here we go... [Stef] This is ours. Jude? Pass it down, pass it down... What you working on? English homework. I have to write a story, and I need a name for the bad guy. You know we busted this dealer. Uh, his name... really bad guy. His name was Freddy. That's a good name. What about Sanchez?
