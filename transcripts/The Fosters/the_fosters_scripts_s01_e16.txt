 Previously on The Fosters: 
 Don't feel to bad. He knows everyone's name. 
 I mean, except mine. 
 [Callie] Kelsey told Principal Sanchez about everything. 
 [woman] You are suspended. If you keep making decisions the way you've been making decisions, you're gonna ruin every good thing that comes your way. You've got a family that wants you. [Callie] I know where I need to be now. Jesus kicked me out of my room. He called it his room. Um, hi. This is Brandon Foster. I can't take piano lessons from you anymore. My family just can't afford it. I love you, Brandon. I never realized until today that for us to be together you have to give up everything. Dad? [Mariana] What was your mom's funeral like? [Jude] Everyone just kept telling us she's in a better place now. Some article in the newspaper today? Make me some overzealous cop with a vendetta. I thought this was supposed to go away. [Dana] Isn't there something that you need to say to your wife? Something about a baby? You wanna have a baby? So, Callie, you're going home. How you feel? Good. Excited. Yeah. Scared? No. A little. [laughter] Be sure to tell Jesus I say hi. Oh, really, Gabi, why don't we talk about what scares us all about going home. Anybody? Temptations. Yeah. Like Brandon. How's that gonna work? Yeah, how is that gonna work, Callie? Have you had any time to think that through? I mean, he's gonna be my brother. Once Jude and I are adopted. So... [Gabi] You're gonna be sleeping under the same roof, he's right next door. You're not gonna be like laying awake thinking you could just sneak into his bedroom? [Rita] Ok, Gabi, enough. Come on. Are you like, really over him? I know what I want. I mean, it's great that you're leaving here knowing what you want, it really is a good start. But it's easy to get confused. You're not going to have group twice a day. You're not going to be confronted by any of these lovely young ladies, trying to get you to talk about how you feel. You gotta hold yourself accountable. Mm, that's right. Least you got people. You're lucky. [Cole] Yeah. [Rita] The mistake most girls make when they go home is they underestimate just how tough it's gonna be out there in the real world. So don't be cocky. And that goes for you too, Daph. Right? Why don't we go around now and everybody can tell Callie what it is they learned from her. Ok, well, Callie, I learned from you to shut up and listen. [Rita] Gab? And to not to interrupt. Ok, well, you know, it's still a work in progress. Yeah. I learned we've all got addictions. And, I could trust you. [Rita] Carmen? I, um, learned to not judge just on, you know, looks. She looked like she didn't belong here... but she did. I didn't really learn anything from you. [laughter] Except I learned how to look like all blank and superior. That's harsh. [Carmen] Come on. No, that's like a really good skill to have in certain situations. Mm. Yeah, that was a nice save. Really, good. Cole. You're up. I learned... that you're my friend. And I learned about forgiveness. Callie, why don't you share with the girls what you learned from them. Um, yeah. Well, you all, um... taught me what courage is. Every one of you, you're so brave and awesome. Even you Becka. [laughter] And Rita. Um... you taught me that compassion is given for free... but... respect has to be earned. I really respect you. Thank you, Callie. I really respect you, too. And we're gonna miss you, right? [all] Yeah. Yeah, you better come back and visit. [all] Yeah. Come on, group hug, let's go. [all groaning] Everybody, Becka, Cole. [indistinct chatter] The last one for Callie, make it good. [all] Ohh! Remember you've got people who love you! [giggles] Welcome home! I missed you. I missed you too, big time. Welcome back. I have to, uh, finish my book report. It's due tomorrow. Sweetheart, can't you finish that after dinner? Oh, it's ok. We'll catch up later, right? Jesus wanted to be here, but he had practice. [Callie] It's cool. So let's go set the table. Ok, I'll take this for you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm really glad you're back. Thanks, me too. What's up? Look, um... this is just something I needed to do, for me. Ok, it's not your fault or anything. What's not my fault? I asked my moms... uh... our... moms, uh... not to tell you, because I didn't want to affect your decision. Brandon, what? I just need some time to figure things out. So I moved in with my Dad. ♪ It's not where you come from ♪

♪ Nothing I would trade ♪ 
♪ I wouldn't have it any other way ♪ 
♪ You're surrounded by love and you're wanted ♪ 
♪ So never feel alone ♪ 
♪ You are home with me ♪ 
♪ Right where you belong ♪ Thanks you for cleaning up, sweetheart. Why don't you come sit down with us, Callie. Um... I just want to say I'm really... really sorry about Brandon moving out. I feel terrible. It's ok. It's only temporary. But he's gonna be around here a lot so you guys are gonna have to... Stick to the ground rules, I know. So listen, things are going to be a little different around here. We're going to need to know where you are at all times, all right? You have wireless and you can text but no Internet. And we're going to need you to leave the Find My Phone app on so we can... Track me down if you need to find me. We know that this is a little bit... No, I get it. I have to earn back your trust. Everyone's trust. [soft rock music playing] ♪ Don't say ♪ 
♪ That this ♪ 
♪ Didn't hurt ♪ [talking in distant] ♪ I cried all night... ♪ [Mariana] ... and you need a comma right here. [Jude] Ok. I think you could cut this sentence shorter and just get to the theme quicker. Right. Hey. Hey. Mariana's been helping me with my paper. That's great. See you in the morning. Yes, you will. [door opens, closes] He's just... I know. It's ok. [Stef] Where's Jesus? He's still getting ready. Don't forget you need to take him to acupuncture after school. [Stef] Yeah, he swears that it's not working. Well, that is part of the deal. He's not been meditating either. Jude, your book report's perfect. Thanks. [Mariana, groaning] My stomach's in knots, I've been suspended for a week but it feels like forever. Are you afraid that they're talking about you? No, I mean... maybe. Do you think they were? What are people saying about Callie? [Lena] It doesn't matter, honey? I think all they heard was that you ran away with Wyatt and, you know, not anything else. I don't really care what other people think. Good for you. Yeah, me either. Let the whole school talk about us. We can be like notorious together. See, I've been notorious. Ain't all it's cracked up to be. [Stef] Ok, where is, uh... Jesus, come on, dude! Where are you? Let's go, shake a leg! [doorbell rings] Hi. Can I help you? Stefanie Foster? Yeah. You've been served. What's that? Uh, it's a summons. I've been called by the D.A. to testify in Mike's case. Why? You were unconscious. I wasn't unconscious. Ana's boyfriend shot me and then dropped the gun. Mike came into the room firing, and did not see that the shooter was unarmed. I was afraid he might've said something and then I would contradict him. I just... I don't... It was a judgment call and... It was a terrible judgment call. Thank you. Thank you. You were heavily sedated when they talked to you, right? You weren't thinking clearly. I wish that were the case. Mike did the right thing. I should have trusted the system, that's all. You were just trying to protect Mike. Well, it doesn't matter, I lied. And now, they're gonna question me under oath. So what happens if you come clean? [exhales deeply] I get fired. Whoa! Uh, jeez. [chuckles] Hey. Hi. Sorry. I'm Dani. I'm a, friend, of your dad's. Oh, uh, it's cool. I just didn't... Yeah, I meant to get up and out. So it wouldn't be awkward. Too late. [chuckles] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Nice jacket. Except for your collar is crooked. Oh. Men just aren't good at dressing themselves. [chuckles] [approaching footsteps] Hey. I overslept! It's ok. Hey, uh, I see you met Hurricane Dani. Shut up! All right, I'm gonna go get dressed. I'm gonna be late and Pilates is my religion. Gotta keep everything high and tight. Don't be late for school! [sighs] You have a girlfriend? [exhales deeply] She's my sober buddy. Well, do you sleep with all your sober buddies? Excuse me? I'm sorry, I thought that you weren't supposed to be getting into any kind of relationships when you're getting sober? It's not a relationship. I'm not drinking. That's the most important thing. Ok? Now get moving. You're not gonna be late on my watch. Oh, uh, for lessons this week. Um... I was actually thinking maybe I could, you know, take a break from piano. What do you mean? You love piano. You worked your ass off to get this teacher to take you. Yeah, I know, I'm just a little burned out. Should I be worried? No. Is this about Callie? No, Dad, I'm ok. I... Thank you for paying for the lessons but... it's not forever. Ok? Ok. All right. Yep. See you. All right, I'll see you later. [bell rings] [indistinct chatter] [Callie] Ignore them. I have no intentions of acknowledging her miserable existence, or her questionnable taste in leggings. Look, I just, what if she's telling Chase terrible things about me? You know that feeling in the pit of your stomach? That is what it feels like to be notorious. [sighs] Hey, welcome back. Aw, you noticed I was gone? So, cast party tonight. We still on? Oh, uh, I don't know. I'm mean, Kelsey's gonna be there and I think I'll just feel weird or... I couldn't care less about the cast party. Maybe we could, go see a movie or something? Yeah. Sure. That sounds good. Sweet! I'll see you at lunch? Hey. Hey. How are you? I'm, great. Oh. Good. What about you? How's your dad's? Oh, um... You know, it's... I gotta... Yeah. See ya. Ok. Hey, uh, Professor Marshall, this is Mike Foster, Brandon's dad. Uh, today, he told me that he wanted to take a break from his lessons. And I'm not sure I should let him. Um, I'd like to discuss that with you, if you can call me back that would be great. Uh, thanks. ♪ It kills me slow ♪ Sorry man. What the hell, man? Faulty boomerang. Maybe I'm not throwing it right. Mind throwing it somewhere else? [Vico] Want a hit? No, thanks. How does that work? Ditching class when your mom's the vice principal? Don't know. You're not gonna narc on me, are ya? No. That Callie girl, she's your foster sister, right? Did she really run away with the mop head? You know, Wyatt. Yeah, I know. She didn't run away with him. Hey, I don't know why everyone keeps saying that. Look, I'm buying the booze for a party tonight. You should come check it out. Sounds like you need to blow off some steam. You're buying the booze? Twenty-three? I look young for my age. Good genes. [chuckles] Where'd you get this? A buddy of mine uses his school ID maker. And it really works? You don't get busted or anything? I use it at liquor stores, bars, never had a problem. If you want one, I could hook you up? I had to say it. It was so cool. Is one of you, Jude? Uh, he is. Then these are for you. [Jude] Thank you. Enjoy! What was that? I don't know. Well, actually, tomorrow is kinda my birthday. How does the cupcake delivery girl know before me? I don't think that's her actual job. My mom gave birth to me at home and when she went to file the paperwork, they messed up the date by a couple weeks. So when Callie and I went into the foster system, we never told anyone my real birth date. We kept it a secret, you know, just for us. So can we eat them? Hold on. She must be trying to send me some type of message or something. [Connor] What does it mean? [Jude] I have no idea. Here. Now, can we eat 'em? Hey. Hey. So, how's it going at your dad's? Ok. Um, he has a girlfriend. Wait, really? It's kinda weird. Well, I mean, he's not working and he's under investigation, I guess he kind of deserves a girlfriend. What's going on with the D.A. and all that, anyway? I mean, is everything ok? Yeah, seems like it. Um, you know, he says they have nothing, except for Ana's testimony. So it should blow over. You know, if it wasn't for me, Mom would've never gotten shot and your dad wouldn't be going through all this. I just... I wish there was something I could do. Maybe if I talked to her... No, don't even think about it. No way. Stay away from her. Yeah, you're right. She'd probably just ask me for more money. Whoa. Hey. Hey. What are you doing home? Um, I'm... I needed something from my room. Ok. What about you? I, um... I'm being questioned by the D.A. this afternoon. And the lawyer told me to come as a person, not a cop, no uniform. This is going away right? I mean, Dad said they have no case. Yeah. Yeah, it's just politics, you know? Nothing to worry about. Ok. Ok. Good to see you. Did you find any more clues at school? I don't think so. I looked all over. Here's one. It says 'anxiety'. That's what I'm getting looking for these clues. I don't see any more ducks. Look for candy! Ok. Oh, I got one. Up here! I don't see any more. Oh, here's one. Hmm. "And... all... anxiety... " they... was... perfect"? How about... "Perfect... anxiety... " they all... and was. I don't think that's it. Hey, Chase. Um, I just wanted to apologize for the whole stolen fedora thing. I don't want you to think I'm that kind of person. Kelsey actually took it, but I should have made her take it back to the store. But you loved it so much and now I'm babbling so... It's fine. No harm done. I just miss you working on the play. I missed that smile, too. You gonna come to the cast party tonight? Yeah, totally. I wouldn't miss it. Sweet, see you there. [woman] Do you solemnly state that the testimony you will give in this deposition proceeding is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do. [man] Please state your name, rank and position in the police department. My name is Stefanie Foster. I am a corporal with... [man] At which point, you were in the second bedroom by yourself, is that correct? Where was your partner at the time? He was clearing the kitchen. And it was at this moment you were shot, fell to the ground, unconscious, correct? No. I'm sorry? No, I was not unconscious. I have here your statement to Internal Affairs, and you clearly state... I lied. I was awake. I saw the whole thing. After firing on me, the shooter dropped his gun and it misfired. He did not have his hands up in surrender when Officer Foster entered and fired on him, as we were trained to do. I see. And how do I know you're not lying now? Because I'm under oath. And because by telling you this, I could very well lose my job. 
 
 I was surprised to hear from you. Thanks for meeting me on such sort notice. Is this about Jesus and Mariana? Are they ok? They are. I mean, they're pretty upset about our mom getting shot. Of course, I'm sure. Can you just tell them that I'm sorry? If you're sorry then why are you lying? Lying? About... Being at the house when my dad shot your boyfriend. I was. With Jesus. At the Women's Shelter. You wouldn't have gone to meet him, knowing that our mom could be dying. Just to get money from him. You wouldn't do that. Right? Because I mean... they would hate you. I mean, right? Right. I wouldn't do that. Because, you care about them. I do. I love them. And you want to maybe someday be a part of their lives. So you gotta tell the D.A. the truth. That you weren't there. Because if you were there... [chuckles] they would never forgive you. I want to tell the truth. It's just... they really want me to testify and I don't... I'm scared that they're gonna cut off my food stamps... Maybe I can help you. That's a lot of money. I just want you to feel safe, you know, to do what's right. The last time you went to a party, Mariana, you got drunk. And I also got grounded and learned my lesson. Besides, it's the cast party, there's not gonna be any alcohol there. Ok, what if Callie goes with me? She didn't drink last time. She can be like my chaperone or something. Yeah, um, I don't think I want that responsibility. You know, I'm on probation, remember? Yeah, I agree. It's not Callie's job to babysit you, honey. Ok, well, you can like drive us off and pick us up. We can even take a Breathalyzer test if you want. Mariana... How are you gonna know if you can ever trust us if you don't give us the chance to prove ourselves? I mean, you want Callie to make friends and get involved. How is she going to do that if she's locked up at home? All right, I will discuss it with mom when she gets home. I found 11 clues. Are there more? I don't know what you're talking about. At least tell me if there are 13. Maybe. Have you figured out what it says yet? No. What does it say? What does what say? The puzzle. What puzzle? You just admitted... I admit nothing. [sighs] Well, if you... if you lose your job, we'll figure it out. It's just... I won't have a baby. I don't want to be the reason that you don't have a baby. It's... life is the reason, ok? Sometimes things are just not meant to be. Hey. Did you talk about the cast party? Can I go? [sighs] What's wrong? Am I in trouble? No, love. [Knocking] Hey. Hey. What're you grinning about? Ana recanted. [Mike, sighing] Said she's wasn't even there at the time of the shooting. D.A.'s dropping the investigation. Oh, my God. [Stef] You're kidding me? [Lena and Mariana chuckle] Wow. Congratulations, Mike. I'm so happy. [Mike] Me too. There's something you don't see every day. Right? Hey, bud. I got your text, what's up? Ana changed her story. It's all over. That's great news. So, how does this affect your deposition? Well, it's dead, right? Yeah, it's dead. I'm gonna open a bottle of champagne. Apple juice for me. You got it. [cell phone rings] [Lena] Wow, so... [Mike] Roberts called. [Lena] You're kidding. [Mike] Yeah, said the D.A.'s office called her and... Hello? Yes. My dad called you? No, I understand. If you could just let me tell him first... Please. No, I will. I promise. Thank you. And I'm sorry to put you in this position. [approaching footsteps] Put who in what position? No one. You just had a conversation with no one? That was my piano teacher. I stopped going a few weeks ago but I didn't tell my dad. And I kept the money. Why would you do that? I was gonna give it to Callie when she was getting her own apartment. Oh, Brandon. I know. It was dumb. I'm going to tell my dad and I'll give the money back. Ok, good. At least you didn't spend it. Just let me know how it goes, ok? ♪ You can run, you can hide ♪

♪ Doesn't matter I'm coming for you ♪ I thought it was supposed to be a small party. There were only four people in the cast, that's not much of a party. Dude, help me get the rest. Ok, I'm not gonna do anything stupid. Oh, there's Chase. I'm gonna go say hi. Be right back. So you think there's anything to drink other than beer? There was a refreshments budget but clearly I wasn't on that committee. Hey, um, I'm sorry if I crashed your... thing with Mariana. It's the only way our moms would let her come. Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, the more the merrier. You were so brilliant in the play. Did you always know you wanted to act? I always knew I wanted to change lives. You do. Every night. Hey, I got you a beer and one for myself. I would have gotten you one, but I remember the last time you drank at a party. Two words: Projectile vomit. Not true. It's ok, there's nothing to be ashamed of, some girls are just lightweights. Um... you know, I'm gonna go say hi to my leading lady. Back off. Or what? I can't believe I ever thought that you were friend. You know, you're just embarrassing yourself in front of Chase. He sees you as a sophomore fan girl and that's it. Oh yeah? Then why did you feel so threatened you had to get me kicked off the play? Do I need to hose you two down with water? Hashtag cat fight. Cat fight? That was incredibly sexist. Is one of those for me? Well, one of them was, but I don't want to be accused of being sexist for not letting you get your own. [dance music continues] ♪ Can't live without music ♪

Um, I should probably go check on her. You got a thing for her. So listen. When can I get that fake IDs? How soon do you need it? I'm looking to make some quick cash so, I don't know, I thought maybe I could buy some beer for parties like you do. Don't bogart my business, man. Look, if you want to make some fast bank, why don't we sell some I.D.s? Isn't that, like, a felony? Only if we get caught. Dude, your mom's the school veep. You have access to her keys, we have access to the ID maker at Anchor Beach. There's no end to the demand. We can make a major business out of this. I only need like a thousand bucks. Well, if you want to think small... Hey. I'm so glad you came! ♪ Something bad, yeah ♪ 
♪ Time to have fun, bend all the rules ♪ 
♪ There I go, yeah ♪ You need to make a bold move. Like what? Well, this one time, I went to a party and there was this guy I liked and I wasn't sure if he was into me. So, I went in the bathroom and took off my panties and slid them in his front pocket. That's a thing? It worked for me. Who was the guy? Wait, don't tell me it was my brother. I'm gonna get another beer. You want one? No, thanks. Hi. Hey. I was just talking about you. Your sister's in here. I know. She's with Callie. Oh. So that's why you're here. I didn't know she was gonna be here. What a coincidence. Callie shows up and you follow her around like a sad, little puppy. I think you've had enough to drink. I should probably just walk away right now but I told you. I told you she wasn't into you and you were just going to get hurt. You know what? I'm so sick of you and everyone else telling me about my business. Ok, Callie is into me. We kissed at the wedding and that's why she ran away with Wyatt. Because she didn't want to mess up Jude's adoption. And the only reason we're not together right now is because she needs a family more than a boyfriend. So don't talk about things you don't understand, ok? If you're interested, I'll be waiting upstairs. Hello, captain, come on in. Thanks. Thank you for letting me swing by. Absolutely. I didn't want to have this discussion at the station. The D.A. e-mailed me your deposition. I see. Strangest thing, I... I can't get the damn thing to open on my computer. But with Ana recanting and the charges being dropped, I can't think of a reason to read it. Thank you. One thing, though, Foster, I.A. took a lot of heat during all this. They're gonna keep their eyes on both you and Mike. So I wouldn't give out so much as a parking ticket without following procedure. You got it. I'm serious, Not a whiff of impropriety, or heads are going to roll. Am I clear? Yes, ma'am. All right, I'll see you on Monday. Yes you will. Have a good night. You too. Thank you. [door shuts] [muted music and chatter] What are you doing up here? Oh, um, nothing. I was just looking for someplace quiet to hang. Oh, cool. Oh, do you mind if I join you? So I... I just want you to know, that, like in case you were wondering... Well, the thing is, I... Oh. Sorry, am I interrupting something? Kind of. No. Not really. We can finish this later. Right, Zac? Yeah. Yeah, sure. It wasn't important. It's just, Callie's looking for you. I believe... these belong to you? [rock music playing] You're pathetic and disgusting. I knew it the first time I saw you, and I let everyone convince me I was wrong. But I wasn't wrong. I was right. Hey girls, watch your backs with this one. She's a two-faced whore, who will kiss your boyfriend, then lie to your face about it. You know, I hope the next time you go back to juvie, that they let you rot in there, bitch. Wait. What are you doing? Taking my pants off. Why? 'Cause it's kinda hard to have s*x with them on. Ok, whoa, s*x? I though we could just make-out a little. You put your underwear in my pocket. I was, you know, flirting. That's not flirting. That's like... it's on. Ok, well, it's not. So what, you're just like a tease, is that it? No. I'm... What, a virgin? I'm not surprised. That's funny? Who put you up to this? Is this a joke or... ? [sighs] So this is not gonna happen? I thought you liked me. All right, look. Can you at least, like, help me out? Um, no. Whatever. Thanks for wasting my time. [door opens, closes] [soft rock music playing] Hey, you ok? Did Talya say something? It's fine. Where is she?! She left. Don't! Don't make a thing out of this, ok? I understand why she's mad. It's my fault. I'm so stupid. I told her about us. Why? Because I can't stand how everyone thinks you ran away to be with Wyatt. And I can't stand you avoiding me. And... How this easy for you? It's not easy. You're not the only one who needs some space to get over this. I'm sorry it hurts you. [sighs] Ok, it hurts me, too. How long do we have to feel this way? Until we don't. [Mariana] Hey. What are you doing here? Did Moms send you to check up on me? No. I go to parties too, you know. Oh, ok. Good, I'm glad you're here. Can you give us a ride home? Sure.
