 [ Telephone rings ] 
 [ Indistinct talking ] 
 [ Whistle blows ] 
 Boy : Ooh! 
 Pam : 5... 6... 7... 8. 1...2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8. 1...2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8. 1 and 2 and 3 and 4... 
 [ Whistle blows ] 
 Again. 
 Again. 
 Stay with him. 
 Slide your feet, anticipate. 
 All right. We'll go again. 
 Don't give up any ground. Don't let him get by you. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Reid : It's good to see you, Taylor. 
 How's your semester going? 
 Taylor : It's good. 
 What did you do over the break? Did you do anything special? 
 Special like, uh, fly somewhere, go boarding, something like that? 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
 That would be special. 
 No. I-I just stayed at home, streamed some TV. 
 That's about as special as it gets. 
 Boy : Come on, man, set your feet. 
 Set your feet. Don't let him get by you. 
 Dan : Stay with him. Don't give up any ground. 
 Keep yourself between the man and the basket. 
 Stay with him. Let's go. 
 And again. 
 Use your hands and go up with them. 
 Finish the play. Let's go. 
 Reid : Well, have you given any more thought to college? 
 I-I've thought about how I can't pay for it, mm-hmm. 
 Well, the school can help with access to all kinds of resources. 
 I mean, we can help with your student loans or scholarships and various grants. 
 Yeah. I'm never getting a full ride. 
 My grades, they aren't all that. 
 Wherever I'm going, I'm still gonna have to pay, so... 
 Well, have you thought about what you'd want to major in? 
 I know I don't have a lot of options. 
 You've got a lot of options. 
 Look, if you could do anything, what would you do? 
 Maybe... 
 I-I don't know. 
 Well, you know what? 
 You really need to think about this, 'cause next year, you're going to be a senior, and these things matter. 
 Okay, what do you care about? 
 What do you want to do with yourself? 
 Dan : Come on, come on, come on. 
 Dan : You all right? 
 Eric : Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Yeah, you want to take a breather? 
 No. 
 Want to keep going? 
 Yeah. 
 Huh? 
 Yes. 
 Don't let him get by you. Don't give up ground. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Kevin : Look, it's all good, man. 
 Hey, stay in there, all right? Don't get frustrated. 
 That's how you get better... Keep going, repetition. 
 Let's go. 
 [ Cellphones beeps ] 
 Anne : Your school called today. 
 Taylor : Yeah? 
 Your adviser, Ms. Reid. 
 Yeah. 
 She said you were in last week, talking about places you wanted to apply. 
 I guess you didn't really talk about it. 
 She just, um, keeps acting like I'm gonna go to Notre Dame or something like that. 
 If that's what you want. 
 No, I don't want that. 
 But she acts like I'm gonna go someplace like that. 
 She's just trying to encourage you. 
 She's just... she doesn't... 
 She's your counselor. 
 She just wants you to start thinking about places like that, or Michigan... Yale... 
 UCLA, wherever. 
 She... she just wants to make sure you take applying seriously. 
 I'm being real. 
 They are the ones not being real. 
 Do you think you can't get in? 
 You should go where you want. 
 How's Evy doing? 
 Okay. 
 You want to invite her over Sunday night? 
 No. 
 Is everything okay with you two? 
 I never should have gone to that school. 
 Leyland? It's a good school. 
 It's gonna help you get into college. 
 Is everything okay with you and Evy? 
 I don't want to go back to that place. 
 I don't. [ Sighs ] 
 I'm gonna get the rest of the stuff. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Eric : Look. Look at this. 
 That's perfect. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Bitch, give it to me. 
 You're stupid, bro. What's wrong with you? 
 All right, man, look, look. 
 What? 
 D-damn. That's Nikki? 
 Yeah, man. Bitch looking good, huh? 
 I  so  want to rape that. [ Laughs ] 
 Wait, I'm-a text it to you. 
 No, uh, don't send that to me. 
 What? You racist? You don't pound Asian bitches now? 
 What? Nikki's not even Asian. What are you talking about? 
 Come on. Hit that, bro. [ Laughs ] 
 Becca : This looks good. 
 Outside... 
 And inside and this one. All right. 
 [ Laughter ] 
 It's the Becca show, front and center, man. 
 You look good. 
 Is that the Miley? 
 Yeah, the Miley. 
 The Miley. 
 Yeah, I recognize that one. 
 Circle? 
 There we go, yeah. 
 And the left cheek, right cheek... 
 Oh! 
 [ Laughter ] 
 Oh, man. 
 She's draw. Okay. [ Laughs ] 
 This is a draw. It is the draw. 
 Yeah, so... 
 And then you could do the double. 
 Oh, so you got... it's your turn? 
 You're... You're going now? 
 Kevin : So, are you coming over or not? 
 Val : [ Sighs ] You know I got stuff to do. 
 What stuff you got to do? 
 We have a test Thursday. 
 Let  me  be your test, please? 
 Oh, really? [ Laughs ] 
 You gonna help me with my homework? 
 Yes. I got you. 
 You promise? 
 If you come over, I got you.

 [ Hip-hop music plays loudly ] 
 You know, before... No, don't do that, Michael. 
 Before that one started coming around, he could do his homework without the music on. 
 Well, what is it? 
 What do you... What do you want? 
 First, you said, "I'll be happy if he comes home with a girl instead of a guy." 
 Then you said, "a black girl instead of a white girl." 
 And now we have one of those, but what, is she not black enough, or t-too black?

 Who? 
 Rhys Bashir's daughter. 
 Who is that? 
 You know, the Indian guy. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 Nicolette. Yeah, you like her.

 But aren't they divorced?

 Hicks : And so, again, just remembering that the European nations at the time were all monarchies, all right? 
 So then, our form of government was quite novel at the time. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Keep reviewing, folks. 
 Hanson : Can I just see Taylor real quick? 
 Okay. 
 Taylor, will you grab your stuff and go with Dean Hanson, please? 
 All right, folks, it seems like there's... 
 Ms. Blaine. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Did they offer you water? 
 I'm fine. 
 Ms. Blaine, I appreciate you coming in. 
 We need to have a conversation, and honestly, it's not the kind of conversation we can have on the phone. 
 Okay. 
 There's a code of conduct at this school. 
 We expect all our students to follow... 
 Is everything all right? 
 There's an issue we've had to address involving Taylor. 
 There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code. 
 Pictures of what? 
 I can't show you. 
 Well, I want to see them. 
 I can't show you the pictures, you understand? 
 Taylor  needs to show you the pictures. 
 Taylor's counselor, Ms. Reid, and I spoke with him. 
 He was given the opportunity to explain himself. 
 He chose not to. 
 We're suspending Taylor from school. 
 It's a three-week suspension beginning as of today. 
 No. You can't suspend him. 
 W-what did he do that you have to suspend him? 
 We have a code of conduct at Leyland... Ms. Blaine! 
 Once you and Taylor have had a chance to talk, when he decides he's ready to go through the process to be readmit... 
 Process? What process? 
 There's a process Taylor's gonna have to go through in order to be readmitted to school. 
 Once he returns to school,  if  he's allowed to return, it's gonna be required... 
 Come on, let's go. Get up. 
 Anne : You are gonna show me those pictures, you understand? 
 We get home, you are gonna be telling me some things. 
 Get in the car, Taylor. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Taylor, get in the car... 
 What? 
 Taylor, get in the car. 
 Get in the car, Taylor. Get in the car! 
 What the...? 
 I can't believe this! 
 You... 
 I can't... 
 [ Man speaking indistinctly on TV ] 
 You ass. 
 Hey. You don't talk like that. 
 Why are you taking videos of me? 
 Oh, you had to show that to her? 
 You took it. 
 Yeah, so you can see what your daughter is doing at school. 
 Stop spying on me. 
 You're out in public doing that. 
 It's not spying if you're out in public doing that. 
 I'm not doing anything. I'm just messing around. 
 That's... that's messing around to you? 
 It's just part of the routine. 
 You don't do a "routine" in a boy's face. 
 Wes is a good kid. It's not about him. 
 Are you defending... 
 We're just... Just [Sighs] be mindful. 
 That's all we're saying. 
 You know what? You don't get it. 
 We don't... we don't what? 
 Don't get what? 
 We don't get why you need to shake your butt at some boy? 
 Why  would you show that to her? 
 Did you or did you not send that to me? 
 Yeah, so that you and I could have a conversation about it. 
 I mean, if I wanted to humiliate her, I could have done that at school. 
 That's what she does when she knows she's being watched. 
 And, by the way, those routines that they're doing, the one that they did at the game... not my department. 
 That's not me. That's Pam. 
 Well... well, what's Pam's deal? 
 Hey, you know? 
 "Send me your suburban white girls so I can teach them how to dance like hos"? 
 Suburban white girls got to learn to dance somewhere. 
 Yeah. It's called a strip club. 
 It's, uh, strippers and not hos.

 Thank you so much for coming. 
 You have to go and see what we are doing. 
 It is amazing. 
 Coach Dan is always honest. 
 You know, whether it's in the classroom or on the court, you know, he keeps us... 
 He keeps us on the right path. 
 And, you know, that's why we are always successful. 
 Not having a father at a young age, Coach Dan was like my father figure. 
 He really pushed me. 
 I feel like he made me a better man. 
 Coach Dan... you know, he's, uh... he's got us winning. 
 So, no lie, that feels good. 
 Um... You know, he teaches us to be the best, and we are the best. 
 We're a team, and Coach Dan... 
 He makes sure we know we're a team. 
 On the court or off the court, everything we do, it's just... it's about doing for each other and being down for each other. 
 So, yeah, I-I can't thank him enough. 
 Isn't that something? Isn't that beautiful? 
 These young men, all wonderful individuals, working together for a common goal, not just winning basketball games, but being there for each other, supporting each other, bringing out the best in each other. 
 Six years ago, the Leyland School was blessed with the arrival of Dan Sullivan. 
 [ Laughs ] [ Applause ] 
 Four winning seasons, a state championship... 
 All of that in just six years. 
 Now, that was also when I became headmaster of the school, but... [ Laughter ] 
 I'm not gonna take credit for Dan's work. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Our mission is to provide young people with the environment they need to excel. 
 We proudly participate in the state voucher program, provide financial aid for deserving students, and we want to do more. 
 We're more than halfway into our capital campaign, $32 million in hand! [ Cheers and applause ] 
 We have just $18 million to go. 
 That's the future of the Leyland School. 
 That's the future of education. 
 Everyone here can make it happen. 
 So raise your glasses, take a gulp, get out your checkbooks, and start writing. 
 Thank you all so much. 
 [ Applause ] 
 Thank you. 
 Man :  Welcome back! 
 This is one of my favorite parts of the show. 
 I'm gonna bring one of our audience members down to take a shot at 1,000 bucks! Hey, dad. Manuel : Hey. Let me get it. Oh, no, no. I'm good. Okay. Are you okay? A little bit sore. Hey, let me get you. [ Sighs ] Are you good? Yeah? I'm gonna check on mom. All the way up to $1 million. We're gonna be right back with more "millionaire" right after this break. Hey, mama. How are you? [ Smooches ] You good? Man :  Our product is guaranteed to be reasonably priced. In fact, you won't find that price anywhere else. Come on down to pick up our showroom floor waiting for you. Come on over. [ Cellphone buzzes ] I'm gonna go out for a minute, okay? [ Smooches ] 
 
 Anne : He won't talk to me. He won't say anything. He's quiet, angry. [ Sighs ] But he won't tell me what's going on. There are pictures. Have you seen them? What's he doing? Just dumb stuff. Do you have them? They got sent around. I want to see them. Kids were putting up messages with them. They were saying nasty stuff. I don't care. I want to see the pictures. [ Sighs ] Ugh. [ Groans ] What's "W.T."? White trash. Mm. Were you there with him? There was a party. It was for the basketball team. It was supposed to be a big deal. Taylor never gets invited anywhere, so he said I could go, too. W-who invited him? This kid Kevin, I think. We went. We kind of split up some. He was hanging out with some of the guys on the team, and he left me with these girls. They were all bitches. They were all cutting me with their eyes 'cause my clothes weren't all this and that and my phone's jacked. They didn't even try to hide it. I wasn't gonna eat their... So I went to go look for Taylor, and when I found him... he was messed up. He was  really  messed up. And all those guys were just standing around and taking those pictures and busting on him. One of them, he finally got Taylor to a car. They just dumped us back at your place. Why didn't you call me? He didn't want me to. He felt bad. He should feel bad. You both should.

[ Cheers and applause ] Terri : Were you supposed to take that last shot. If I was open, yeah. So you were supposed to take it. If I was open, yes. That was your ball. Well, he really didn't have a look. He had a good enough shot. You don't just pass it off to somebody else. You know, for somebody that didn't even like basketball, you're started to kind of... I don't care a thing about it. I don't, and that's not even what I'm talking about. That was your ball. You take the shot. [ Door opens ] Anne : I talked to Evy. I saw the pictures. Leave it. Those are online. Kids are just sending them around. Just leave it alone, please. They're there forever. Do you know... you know... Unh-unh, no, no. Do you know... How hard it was to get you into that school? I mean, do you... Do you understand how much it takes out of this house?! And you get kicked out for doing something stupid?! I mean, what... what were you doing?! I... I-I don't know. You  do  know. No. You do! That's why lied to me! No! Tell me right now! Stop, please! Would you just tell me?! Because I'm gonna find out! Stop, stop! I don't know! Tell me right now what... I don't know! I don't know what happened! I had a couple of beers, yeah. You were drinking? They kept sh... they kept shoving them in my face. Who? Who was doing this? Guys on the team. They were telling me to be fun. "Why don't you be fun?" They were angry about it. "Just be fun." So I wanted them to stop. I had a beer. And then everything got messed up. Messed up how? I couldn't stand up. I felt sick. They were grabbing at me, laughing at me... Where was Evy? Taking those pictures. No one was helping you when you were down there like that? I don't know. I don't remember. I just... I, um... I know... I wasn't lying. I just... I didn't tell you because... I was ashamed. I was, um... so... Mom, I, um... They did something to me. I think someone... I think someone did something to me. Mom... [ Sobbing ] Woman : Hold on, hold on. Let's go back. When you do that first move, relax into it, okay? Don't announce. Just let it flow. Okay? Let's go again. [ Door opens ] [ Whispering indistinctly ] Anne? Leslie Graham. We met last summer during the school orientation. Well, I wish we could be sitting down for other reasons, but I obviously know about your son's situation and the pictures that were posted online, but Dean Hanson told me you think there might be more to this story. My son was assaulted. Let's talk about it. Tell me what you believe happened... thank you. There was a party. Taylor was invited. T-t-there were other kids there. Whose party? Do you know where the party was held? I don't know. Something for the basketball team. Hanson : The Captains' party? That's what you're talking about? I don't know. He was invited, and... and... And there was kids there, and they were drinking. Was your son drinking? He did have some. He admits it. I know you've seen pictures of him, but he wasn't drunk. Someone gave him something. Gave him? Drugs or something. But you're saying  gave  him? He didn't take them voluntarily? No. Someone gave him something. They gave him drugs, and then they assaulted him. Physically assaulted? Sexually assaulted? Sexual. What did he say that makes you believe that? It's, uh... It's what he  didn't  say. It's... it's things he couldn't talk about. Why do you believe someone might have hurt your son? He doesn't fit in. He's on financial aid... White trash. We don't make judgments based on... Well, I've seen texts going around calling him that, so it happens. When Taylor got home that evening, did you notice anything about him, about his behavior? I wasn't home. I was working. [ Sighs ] Someone invited your son to this party, gave him drugs without his knowledge, and then they touched him or violated him against his will? Yes. The Captains' party was... It would have been last Saturday. And this is the first time Taylor said anything to you after you found out about the pictures? Yes. Ms. Blaine, we take your concerns very seriously. We are going to look into this, and we are gonna do so immediately. This is obviously a sensitive subject. Until we can determine what happened... I told you what happened. Until we can support that, I would just ask that we keep the matter confidential, for everyone's sake. I would ask that you trust we will do all we can to get this right. Okay. This is just acknowledging that you met with us and that you gave a statement. Thank you. Would you witness this? We mean what we say. We'll get answers. And I appreciate... I deeply appreciate you coming to us with this situation. You gonna be okay to get home? Okay. Leslie : Dan, do you have a second? We had a parent come in. Some... allegations were made. Allegations... the best way to phrase it. Dan : Allegations about? Something happened at the Captains' party. A student is claiming to have been assaulted. Wait, wait... by one of my players? Yeah. Well, you know that's a lie. Well, it may be, but there  were  things happening at that party. Don't think your kids are above mistakes. You need to talk to your players. We have to make it clear we take this matter seriously, give them the opportunity to offer up any information they might have. Who's saying this? [ Scoffs ] You need to be objective. I don't want to bias what you might hear. But, I mean, you know if... if you... If it feels real or if it's just talk. Well, that's what we don't want... For talk to get around, social media. Everything happens quickly. There were parts of the story the accuser wasn't particularly specific about. I don't know if much happened beyond some bad judgment. Oh, I'll bring them in, talk to them. Talk to  all  your players together. Avoid any of them feeling singled out. That would be my suggestion. If there is anything, bring it to my attention. If there's nothing... Oh, we'll find that out real fast. Well, then, that's the end of it. They trust you. That means a lot more than me going down there and turning it into an inquisition. Okay? Mm-hmm. Okay. [ Laughter, indistinct conversations ] [ Laughs ] Boy : Dan! All : Dan! [ Applause ] Bring it in. Bring it in. Everybody hear me? All : Yes, sir. You know, one of the... One of the things we... We talk about a lot is how you represent, you know, on the court, off the court. Everything we do, it's about each other... The school, students, faculty,  everybody. It's about respect. It's being respected and how others view us. There was, um... You all had the Captains' party last Saturday. We need to talk about that. Steph : You all right? Me? Yeah. Did it get messy? You know what it is? Somebody going, "I'm hearing a noise in the basement. Go see if we've got rats." Well, you know, then I'm the one. I got to go in and start rooting around. And I got these guys... They're looking at me like... You know, like I-I was accusing them. Well, you were told to talk to them. No, I was told to go in and tell them. It wasn't even, "did you do something?" It's, "what did you do?" [ Sighs ] What'd you tell Leslie? Nothing. No, no, thanks. I mean, if there was something, I'd know something... If there was something. You know, what I... What I really don't like... I don't like that I'm the one that's got to go in and dig the dirt. Well, it's not about  you. Hey, we need to talk with Becca. She wasn't at the party. She is a cheerleader. Some of them were there. I-I do not want her at those parties. Are we gonna lock her in her room? God, I absolutely missed that turn in life... that... In high school, we used to brush by the boys in the hallway, just to see if we could make them hard. [ Chuckles ] And now I've got this 17-year-old daughter who thinks her mother is, you know, whatever. Eh. She's fine. Frigid or whatever. She's just, you know? We're getting so old. [ Chuckles ] Isn't it weird to think that people our age, they used to be getting ready to die. You turn 50... You're not 50 yet. I have one more week. You turn 50, and then you've got like five good years, and then you die. [ Chuckles ] We're not that old yet, I guess. Hey, what do you want to do about Becca? Me? Yeah. It's a... it's a mom/daughter talk. No, no. It's better coming from you. This is a pen1s conversation. Every one of them has got its eye on her. It can't be a s*x talk. It's got to be a trust talk, you know? I don't want her to think she can't ever come to us with her stuff. You falling asleep? Sorry. Mm. [ Smooches ] Leslie : How is Taylor doing? He's all right. He seems to be coping? No, not really. Oh, I would hope during this time that he stays engaged. If he needs help with schoolwork, please know he still has access to teachers and to resources online. What are you doing about what happened to him? We looked into the situation, and there are individuals who will be disciplined. Disciplined? How? I can't go into specifics with you. Anyone who's involved deserves a measure of privacy. Well, y-you don't care about my son's privacy. There are pictures of your son engaged in lewd behavior. No. What he was doing he was doing in public. What he was doing? What  he  was doing? You mean what was done to him! You asked us to look into this, and we did. No, what was done to him! My son was raped! You need to be careful with that word. If somebody messed him up, they touched him... That is rape. You need to be very careful with that word. You sat in that room. You were emotional. You told a story that was barely coherent and made accusations, as you put it, based on things your son  didn't  say. He was drugged. His girlfriend was there. She saw him. You came in and made a statement. Six times, you used the phrase "I don't know" or "I'm not sure." You signed that statement. Just to say that I talked to somebody! Your son didn't volunteer to come forward. You're making a claim in his absence only  after  the pictures surfaced. I came in as soon as I knew. We've taken disciplinary action appropriate... What are you doing to those boys?! Tell me what you're doing to the boys! The suspension given your son is fair, and it's correct. Take the time to be with your son, to engage him, to help him make better choices. He didn't choose this. I know you want to believe your son, but consider what it means to falsely accuse other young men of something that is... Quite frankly, it's bizarre. As bad as it may seem, it can get worse. We have counseling services if you and your son would like to speak with... Got to go. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Sobbing ] [ Dialing ] Man : 911. What's your emergency? Yeah... Hello? I want to report a rape. Please.
