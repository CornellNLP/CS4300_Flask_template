 Hanson : Ms. Blaine, we're suspending Taylor from school. 
 There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code. 
 There was a party. It was for the basketball team. 
 He was  really  messed up. 
 I think someone did something to me. 
 A student is claiming to have been assaulted. 
 By one of my players? 
 Don't think your kids are above mistakes. 
 We have to make it clear we take this matter seriously... 
 man : 911. What's your emergency? 
 I want to report a rape. 
 You need to discipline one of your players. 
 Who am I supposed to sit? 
 Well, it was the captain's party. 
 Eric Tanner. 
 That little bitch said something. 
 It's nothing. 
 Well, it's nothing for you. 
 They're not doing anything to you. 
 Good looks. You've got money. 
 There are girls out there, they're gonna be coming hard at you for that. 
 You know who he should be seeing? 
 Rhys Bashir's daughter. 
 Hey, lookit. 
 That's Nikki? 
 Yeah, man. Bitch looking good. 
 We're not just talking about feeding kids. 
 This is a civil rights issue. 
 A civil rights issue? 
 So what's the problem? 
 That the people being hurt don't look like you? 
 Anne : What are you doing about what happened to him? 
 You came in and gave a statement. 
 Six times, you used the phrase "I'm not sure." 
 You signed that statement. 
 That school wants to hide it. 
 The police want to ignore it. 
 Are you sure you want to go public with this? 
 Yes. 
 Abigail : Seating for 2,442 people. 
 Boxes in the parterre, mezzanine, and balcony levels. 
 As far as the sound... 
 It's got to feel like... I want it to be an experience. 
 It's one of the finest event spaces in the midwest. 
 Everyone will feel every moment of the performance. 
 Cammy : These allegations of sexual assault are very serious. 
 And we've taken them very seriously. 
 We were the ones who made the report to the police. 
 Ms. Blaine said  she  called the police. 
 Well, she may have eventually, but we met with her at least three times before she chose to contact them. 
 Each time, she was emotional, um, vague. 
 I have... I have the signed statement that we gave to the police. 
 Makes it hard to follow up when the answer to every other question is, "I don't know." 
 She claims her son was drugged. 
 We have no way of knowing that, but if there was even the slightest chance that were true, we felt we had a responsibility to call the police. 
 But you suspended her son? 
 For what he was doing in those pictures, yes. 
 There was alcohol at that party, drug use by some... 
 No one... not the police... have mentioned drugs. 
 So why single out one student? 
 No one was singled out. 
 And a student who's on financial aid. 
 We suspended her son. 
 We suspended one of the captains of the basketball team. 
 I show you this in confidence. 
 Here's the notice of his suspension. 
 We don't play favorites. 
 Every student is treated equally. 
 I understand Ms. Blaine may feel otherwise, but we've done all that we can. 
 Even at that, she's dissatisfied with our response. 
 She's apparently dissatisfied with the police response, too. 
 It might be more productive to focus on why her son was out binge drinking in the first place. 
 I hope you'll give that equal weight in your article. 
 Abigail : How is it? 
 Wonderful. 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 Dr. Esposito : So, tell me what's going on. 
 How are you feeling? 
 I'm sorry I ever opened my mouth. 
 I'm sorry I ever said anything about what happened to me. 
 Why? 
 You don't know? 
 Ashamed. 
 It's what everything I read online tells me to feel. 
 Do you feel ashamed? 
 I got my mom dragging me around to the cops, to doctors. 
 She's telling them I got assaulted, and... they're all just, like, smirking and cutting on me and... 
 Why do you think that? 
 I don't  think  it. They're... they were  doing  it. 
 Look, if I was a girl... 
 Peop... people lose their minds when something happens to a girl. 
 They have rights groups supporting them. 
 They have lesbians out hating men, but... a guy? 
 You really believe people don't care when a male is violated? 
 I put a mattress on my back and carry it around, you think they're gonna put me on TV? 
 Is that what you want? 
 You want that kind of attention? 
 I just want it to be over. 
 I go on Instagram, I go on Vine, and somebody's got my picture, somebody's saying some stuff, and... 
 My mom just keeps wanting me to talk about it. 
 She's... she's doing interviews and crap. 
 She's... 
 She just wants to be there for you. 
 Now she does. 
 Now? 
 Do you doubt the choices she's made? 
 I don't want to talk about old stuff. 
 Not to me. 
 If there are things you feel like you're holding on to... 
 Have you ever tried to talk them through with your mother? 
 She's got enough she's got to worry about. 
 [Cash register clicking, drawer closes] 
 Let me see it. 
 No. No. 
 Who you been texting, then? 
 Nothing. No one. It's... [chuckles] 
 What have you been doing? Who have you been texting? 
 Thank you. Okay. 
 Man : Thank you. 
 It's not a big deal. 
 You're obviously hiding something. 
 Not a deal... It is not a big deal. 
 Come on. 
 Stop! Ow! 
 Let me see it. 
 Stop! 
 [Chuckling] Stop it. 
 What... you're causing a scene in here. 
 Stop it. Shh! 
 You know... Be quiet. 
 I'm tr... you... me? 
 Is everything all right? 
 What? 
 Is everything all right? 
 Not your business. 
 Well, I'm the manager. It is my business. 
 Well, she's fine. 
 I'm talking to her. 
 Mm. 
 We're just messing around. [Chuckles] 
 Okay, you... can you... please not do that? 
 I'll touch her however I want. 
 [Sighs] You need to get out. 
 Bitch, don't talk to me like that. 
 Babe. 
 We didn't do anything. 
 You need to get out now. 
 Let's just go. Please. 
 [Plates and utensils clatter] 
 Terri : You're done. 
 I'm terminating your employment here as of today. 
 Debra : Why? 
 You know why. 
 I don't. 
 I've been trying to get in with you for a week. 
 Debra, I've been here all week. 
 If you couldn't get in contact with me, you should've talked to Ed. 
 Ed? 
 Ed's been singling me out. 
 Ed has given you five verbal warnings before today. 
 For petty stuff, Terri. He was picking on me. 
 Then you should have talked to H.R. 
 They don't care. They don't want to fix problems. 
 They just make them go away. 
 Do you have any final questions for me? 
 God, Terri, please. 
 Your cubicle is being packed by security. 
 Can't you move me under somebody else? 
 No. 
 You run this division. You can't do anything for me? 
 You'll have to sign for your personal belongings when you pick them up. 
 I wish you luck in all your endeavors. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Sighs] [Door closes] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Utensils clack] 
 "Can't you do anything for me?" 
 They show up late every other day, do substandard work when they're there, ignore every single warning you give them, but the minute they're in trouble [scoffs] Out comes the black card. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Scoffs] I mean, seriously. 
 It's like, "c-can you just make this one exception? 
 Can't you just help me out this one time, sista?" 
 You know what? 
 That's the one advantage white people have. 
 Because they only have one, right? 
 [Laughter] 
 [Scoffs] Okay, but the one I'm talking about... 
 They don't have to deal with expectations. 
 Not expectation, but I-I-I'll tell you what they do have. 
 They have this... this sense of entitlement, right? 
 Mm. That's a whole other... 
 Dirt poor, high-school dropouts, Yes. 
 And still they give you this attitude, right? 
 Right, right, right. Like, "w-why are you here?" 
 [Chuckling] Right, right. 
 You know, "why are you telling  me  what to do?" 
 Yeah. 
 "Because I can afford to be here. That's why." 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I am your boss. 
 That's why I can tell you what to do. 
 That's my whole day right there. 
 I'm dealing with expectations on one side and then entitlement on the other. 
 Hey, I'm gonna, uh, take Nikki and float some. 
 Just... 
 Okay. Kevin. 
 I'm just... I'm just showing her around. 
 Don't... 
 That's... 
 Don't go far, man. 
 Okay. Let's go. 
 Rhys : He's enjoying his... His season, his school, yeah? 
 Terri : Yeah. Yeah, he is. 
 Well, he's doing this... 
 Michael : I don't really know anything about basketball. 
 [Laughter] But, uh... 
 [Jarryd James' "Give Me Something" plays]

 What's up with you and Val? 
 Nothing's up.

 I know you're not trying to act like no good girl. 
 What? 
 Tell me what you said. 
 I'm just saying you don't have to act like you're not down. 
 I saw the pics you posted on, uh... [Chuckles] 
 Well, that body's... Your body's bangin'. 
 So that's why you brought me out here? 
 You think I get down? 
 I sent those to that ass... Eric. 
 He put those up 'cause that's all I gave him. 
 Okay, why you getting on me? I didn't know. 
 You're all the same... Always trying to get some. 
 Then, as soon as you do, you run and tell everybody how we're all sluts? 
 That's not even me. 
 You're, like, notorious. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay, what do you know?

 [Chuckles] "All right"? 
 We gonna see more of her? 
 Girls, man... They just... just be trippin'. 
 Yeah, they be trippin'. 
 Lesson one. 
 Women... you just... 
 You can't win. 
 So it's about figuring out how much... 
 How much you gonna lose. 
 How much you lose with mom? 
 Nothing. [Scoffs] 
 You just don't want me to run and tell, huh? 
 No, no. No, seriously. 
 I didn't... I didn't lose anything. 
 Okay. 
 I gave up a couple of things, but that was by choice... Big difference. 
 When I was ready to be with your mother, I had to decide, "what kind of husband are you gonna be, what kind of father?" 
 So, yeah, I... gave up things. 
 But I wasn't gonna be the black man who couldn't keep his family together. 
 See, that's... that's what's messed up. 
 It's like... Uh, you and mom, right, you're always doing stuff or you're not doing this or that 'cause you think people are watching you. 
 No, no. 
 No, we do how we do no matter what. 
 But don't ever think they're not keeping score.

 [Mouse clicks] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Hello. This is Cammy. 
 You didn't focus on the rape at all. 
 You mentioned one guy by name, but that was it. 
 I mean, you wrote that the school called the police? 
 I mean, it sounds... It so... 
 I presented the facts. 
 I can't call it rape if the facts don't support that. 
 [Sighs] 
 I-it sounds weak. 
 You asked me to keep you and your son anonymous. 
 That limits what I can say. 
 You told me you were gonna go after the school. 
 I'm not going to make things up, Anne. 
 When there are new facts, I'll report them. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hello? 
 Yeah. 
 If there's something new, I'll follow up, okay? 
 Take care, Anne. 
 Yeah. [Telephone beeps] 
 Good morning. 
 Terri. 
 Good morning, Tom. 
 Hey, um, is Kevin okay? 
 Kevin's fine. 
 Oh, uh, just the... the article made it sound like... 
 What article? 
 He was in trouble or some... 
 What article? 
 Uh, the  Times Herald. 
 There's something on their website about Kevin, something about a sexual assault. 
 Are they saying Kevin was assaulted? 
 I didn't really understand what... 
 Uh, what did the police tell you? 
 I mean, it's just kids. It was a party. 
 Somebody's just... 
 I mean, it's got to be a mistake, right? 
 Just stop talking. [Ringing] 
 Rob Silverman's office. 
 It's Terri Lacroix. 
 Can we return? 
 I need to speak with him. 
 What's the best number? 
 I need to speak with him now. 
 Hold on. Let me see if I can get him. 
 [Telephone beeps, receiver clacks] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Ringing] 
 Michael : Hey. 
 Michael, you have to get Kevin from school. 
 What's wrong? 
 There's an article online about a sexual assault at a party, and Kevin's name is... 
 What? 
 Rob :  Hello? 
 Kevin what? 
 Rob? 
 Rob, hold on. Michael, get him now. 
 I'll call you back in two minutes. 
 Okay. 
 [Cellphone clacks, telephone beeps] 
 Rob, there's an article online from the  Times Herald. 
 Rob : Keep talking. I'm searching for it. 
 They're saying something about a sexual assault that took place at a party, and Kevin's name was published. 
 Uh, found it. 
 Give me two seconds, Terri. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where is Kevin? 
 Michael is getting him from school. 
 Don't say anything to anyone.  Okay. 
 If they pick Kevin up, just make sure he doesn't talk to anyone. 
 Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? 
 If they arrest him? 
 Take him home. 
 I'll come to you. 
 We'll be there. 
 Okay. [Receiver clacks] 
 [Ringing] 
 I'm almost at the school. 
 Okay. Bring him home. Rob will meet us at the house. 
 What does the article say? 
 [Exhales sharply] "Indianapolis Police have confirmed that they are investigating members of the prestigious Leyland Academy basketball team." 
 What does it say about Kevin? 
 Are you close to the school? 
 "Kevin Lacroix, 18, captain of the Leyland basketball team, hosted the party where the alleged sexual assault took place. [Sighs] 
 Alcohol use documented on social media..." 
 Oh, God. 
 I'm on Kevin's Facebook page now. 
 People are already saying things. 
 Stop reading that. 
 [Exhales sharply] Wha... it's been online, what, two minutes, and people are already talking? 
 Stop reading! I'm here. 
 [Sighs] I'm at the school. Listen to me. 
 It's going to be okay. Okay? 
 [Sighs] Yeah. 
 It's going to be okay. 
 Yeah. 
 I'll call you when he's in the car. 
 [Ringing] 
 You've reached Detective Williams at the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. 
 Please leave a message. Ken, it's Terri. I need you to call me as soon as you get this message. Call me on my cell. [Cellphone beeps] Rob : You rented the space for the party? Yeah. Was there alcohol? Answer him. Yes. Who brought it? I did. Were you inebriated? I mean, everybody was. Were you? I had some, yeah. At any point, were you alone with a girl? A couple of times, yeah. Did you have s*x with any of them? One of them. Her name? Val. What did I tell you about that girl? Huh? Terri. Was the encounter consensual? I guess. What kind of s*x was it? Was it oral, vaginal? [Sighs] Yeah. "Yeah"? "Yeah," what? [Sighs] Both. And where did you have intercourse? A bathroom. You screwed that girl on the bathroom floor, Kevin? And you're sure that it was consensual? She, uh... Yeah, it's... There's, like, this thing at the party. It's, um... It's like a tradition. Everybody calls it "making the team." And, um, you know, if you're a senior, you go in there to hook up, basically, and... You know, girls go in there to... To "make the team." So that's what the party was about... having s*x? And the hazing? There were some pictures that were sent around... No, I didn't have anything to do with that. I was with Val. Michael : So, what are they gonna charge him with? Well, if Kevin is arr... Am I going to jail, man? If Kevin is arrested, if charges are filed, sexual battery is serious. That coupled with a controlled substance used to incapacitate the victim... That's a level 5 felony, punishable by up to six years in prison. [Exhales sharply] Look, I-I didn't do anything, man! Terri : Stop it. Stop it! I didn't touch anybody! So the article doesn't specifically say that Kevin is being investigated for sexual assault. The article is just an article. That's not what we need to worry about. Terri : So then why did they call him out? Kevin's 18. Legally, he's an adult. They can print his name. He's two or three months older than the other kids, so they call him out? Do you know what they are saying about him online? Black, drugs, rape. What do you think they're saying, Rob? The police have not tried to make contact. Clearly, they don't have anything actionable. I think the best thing for us is just stay silent and don't talk about it. [Scoffs] Stay silent? No, we're not gonna say nothing. Anything that you say in public, even in support of Kevin, can make matters worse. We'll find out what we can, and we'll deal with it. Mnh-mnh. You all have nothing but friends and supporters backing you here. No one believes any of this crap... No one who matters. [Sniffles] [Indistinct conversations] Wes : Nothing? No, I keep texting him. He won't hit me back. All I know, his dad rolled by, picked him up. Damn, man. That party was messed up, man. I knew we were gonna get in trouble. Shut up. Look, I don't need this, okay? I'm not trying to go to jail. Shut up! What, you think Kevin just disappeared for nothing? That article's talking about how it's rape. Nothing happened at that party except people acting stupid, so going on about it doesn't help anything. Hey. He... He's talking sense, son. Look, around the way, we don't say nothing about nothing. Right? Yeah. Right. Okay. That's what's up. Look, just keep to yourself, and it's all good. We'll be all right. All right. [Sighs] All right, man. Later. Later, man. 
 
 [Ringing] Hey, what up? It's Kevin. Uh, leave a message. I'll hit you back. [Beep] Uh, Kevin, it's Dan. Uh, listen, I saw the article, and, um... You know, I'm just, uh, checking on you. Dan : Don't get tired on me. They told me your dad picked you up. Uh... Well, I just want to make sure that everything's, uh... Look, I... I know things aren't good, and I just want to make sure that... that you're okay. People are, you know, saying things, and... Uh, ignore them. Here we go. Game point. All right? And... And if you want to... You want to talk to me, you just... you call me, okay? [Breathing heavily] All right, Kev. [Exhales sharply] Wayne : Are you good? [Exhales sharply] Look, Kevin's fine, man. No, it's permanent. You type their names into Google, rest of their lives... Rape. That's all you're gonna see. Kid's rich. Doesn't have a damn thing to worry about. We need to worry about us. What about us? It rolls, man. Who do you think's gonna get blamed for these knuckleheads? Getting drunk, taking pictures... Doing whatever else. Look, you read that article. "Elite school." "Privileged kids." Th-they're stirring people up. And who do you think's gonna take the hit? Ah. Well, we got a good relationship with the school. Look, you and me are hired help. Don't get to thinking otherwise. Look, we're not going anywhere. You want to bail? Bail. All right? You want to quit? [Slaps knees] Go for it. I am not walking on these kids. [Door opens] [Indistinct conversations] Man : So, then X equals negative 4 plus or minus the square root of 16 minus 24... Mr. Alejandro? You have a second, please? [Marker clacks] Po-po's comin' for the brothas. [Laughter] Nah, they're comin' to deport your ass. Ooh! [Laughter] Hey, settle down. Quiet. Evy, could you step outside, please? Gonna get it for selling her melons on the off-ramp. [Laughter] Chris : Evy, this is Detective Krasno. He's asking about a Leyland basketball party. Were you there? It's okay, Evy. Yeah, I was there. Krasno : Evy, we have some questions regarding a possible incident that night. It would be real helpful if you could come down to the station with us. Hold on. You didn't say anything about taking her anywhere. Just to ask some questions. You don't have to go anywhere with them. You don't have to say anything to them. You all are going to need one of her parents if you want to talk to her. We really need to speak to her. This is a serious investigation. You want to ask her things, it's going to be here, with a parent. Otherwise, she's got class. Where can we wait? This way. Krasno : What time did you get to the party? Uh, was maybe after 9:00. You were with Taylor the whole time? Pretty much. But not all the time? You remember if he ever left the party with someone? No. No, you don't remember, or, no, he didn't... No, none of that. Do you remember who he was hanging out with? I don't know those kids. Did you see Taylor spend any length of time with a male indmdual? I don't get what you're saying. Was there an argument? Did they step away to another room? I don't know what you're asking. She doesn't know anything. She keeps telling you she doesn't know anything. We're almost finished, sir. When did you see Taylor again? Maybe uh, 1:00, 1:30. What was his condition? He was messed up. He was... He was more than that. He couldn't even stand up. His clothes, they were all... half on, something crazy. Nobody was trying to help him. People were taking pictures. This guy on the team... Eric, I think... He drove us home. I don't know him, but he was off about something. He dropped us. He didn't even help us in the house. He just dumped us on the curb. Did Taylor say anything to you the next day? We didn't talk. I was pissed at him for taking me to that joint. Are we done? [Chairs scrape] I might be in touch. [Indistinct chatter] What up, ma? Nothing. Why you getting snatched out of class like that? For real, it was nothing. Okay. Just looking out. I'm good. Lilah : Did you see the article? [Scoffs] I hate that place. We're in debt because of that school, and for what? So he can get drunk at parties, rape girls? Curt : Eric's grades are good. He's doing great on the team. Well, I heard him talking on the phone. It was "bitch" this, "whore" that. I-I don't even know him anymore. He's a teenaged boy... Stop making excuses for him. He's been different ever since he started going there. Okay. "Okay," what? I am just tired of fighting with you. So, okay. Whatever you say. All that bitch does is yell. Do not talk about mom like that. She does. That's all she does is scream. She's, like, crazy. Telling you, I don't let none of my girls... What? "Your girls"? I got girls. Let me see some pictures. I don't take pictures. I'm not a freak like you. Yeah, yeah. Eat your food, cool Jack. How's school? Public school bites. It's like a jungle. I want to go to Leyland. Then you shouldn't suck so bad at basketball. I'm serious. I want to go to Leyland. Then we could hang out. We hang out now. It's not the same. Look, in public school, they got the best bitches. All right? They got latinas, black, Asian... All they got at Leyland is the pasty white girls. Yeah? Yeah. And Asian girls are the best babies anyhow. Don't see a good-looking Asian baby. [Chuckles] Should be glad you're there. Eat your food. We'll go shoot some buckets. [Train horn blares] Dr. Lewis is... She's well-intentioned. She tries to do right. Hmm. She's got the same wind-up about you. Yeah, I'm sure. "Well-intentioned, but she doesn't know what she's doing"? "Well-intentioned, but a little too socially indulgent." Well, if I'm indulgent, she's... I know she's your friend. She's our superintendent. Her perspective doesn't reflect new realities. Look, things got heated in the district meeting... You don't have to apologize. I'm not. I'm just saying, this is an opportunity for us to talk one on one. Okay. I know Dr. Lewis wants you to speak against HHFK... Not against it. About how it's being implemented. That's what I'm talking about. She can't see that the breakfast program hurts kids because the kids she's hurting are hispanic. You saying she's racist? Hispanic kids are the ones who are gonna be the most affected. If it were black kids, yeah, I think she would see things differently. So, I don't support you, I'm a racist. Black people can't be racist? "Racist" and "black people" in the same sentence? You keep saying that word, not me. People have blind spots. I'm just trying to help you see yours. [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Japanese] That doesn't make me Japanese. If we don't get ourselves together, we don't quit this infighting, they're gonna charter us. Everything's an agenda? Are they busting the Union or not? Are they gutting education? Don't give them excuses. I can't talk about this. I... I don't want to talk about this. Okay. Y-you're leaving? Well, you don't want to talk. Y-you don't want to have something to eat? Did you think this was gonna be social? Sure, I... yeah. I'm actually hungry. [Purse unzips] So, what's good? [Breathes deeply] The tofu sandwich is pretty good. I don't eat tofu. [Cellphone rings, buzzes] [Breathes deeply] [Sighs] Hello? Hey. It's Nikki. Hey. You okay? Kevin? [Voice breaking] I'm scared. You want me to come over? [Breathes deeply] Kevin? No, I'm okay. If you want me to come over or something, text me, okay? Yeah. Okay. Talk to you later. [Cellphone thuds] [Sniffles] [Breathes deeply] Steph : Okay. What about that one? Woman : No. That's a group photo. Can't you just erase her? Well, taking your daughter out of these photos... It's... It's not that easy. I read that article online. Made it sound like these girls just walk around all day giving out hand jobs. I don't want my daughter on this school's website. Well, this is a group picture. I mean, she might feel left out. Left out of people thinking she's a slut? We pay good money to send her here. She doesn't need that. Well, it's gonna take a little time. I'll wait. Steph : So, she stood over me for an hour. I mean, who does that? Everybody's frustrated. Well, I think she thinks her daughter's a ho and that's why she wanted her picture taken off the page so fast. She probably already has a rep. Mm. It was a bad day. I guess, just, you know, chalk it up to that. That article... That is... It is really stirring something, I'm telling you. I know. You know, Kevin... You know, he still hasn't called me back yet. I'm worried. C-can you not do that? What? Just steer the conversation to your boys. I'm trying to tell you about how I got dumped on today. I know you are. Can you please just listen? I-I know. Do you have to redirect? [Sighs] I'm... I'm... I'm stressed. I-I need to relax. Yep. Relax or "chill?" What? [Pen thuds] You know, I mean... It started off casual, but now you're on the pot candy every day. [Scoffs] You started that. What? Yeah, on our six... our seventh date... What was the song that you would always put on? "Reasons." Oh, God. So cheesy. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's the opposite of cheese. And you talked me into smoking a joint... Because you said the s*x would be better. Yeah, well... Because it is. Well, you ought to think about partaking again. The school drug tests me. I mean... I know. No, but, how would that look? I come up positive in the middle of all this? Yeah, I know. Just... There used to be signs. You know, you would... You would put on your corny music or roll a joint or there'd be a bottle of red. Have the signs changed, or am I missing them? Things change, yeah. But you still got it. Well, I'm going up to bed. I'll probably be up for a while. Okay. Evy : The cops pulled me out of class today. They were asking about the party. What did you tell them? So you're not gonna ask how  I'm  doing? [Scoffs] Look, whatever. I got enough going on with my mom. My dad had to leave work early, so now his check's gonna be short. I don't need that. Cops kept pressing me about you and a guy. What, did you get in a fight or something? No. Then, what? My mom's just making a big deal about those pictures. The cop wasn't asking about pictures. Where did you go at the party? I was just hanging. Hanging where? I couldn't find you. You got me lying to your mom, and now I got to deal with the cops, just so you could hang out with the rich kids? [Scoffs] That school made you different. Just come back to Marshall. My mom wants me to stay at Leyland. You know what? It's not all about her. You need to take care of you and stop acting like she's gonna fall apart. I'm not. Well, you're not the one who screwed up. She is your mom. She made her choice. The case is being worked outside of my division, so I don't have a whole lot of info. On the sexual assault, the blood work came back negative. There were no traces of GHB in his bloodstream. "His"? Kevin's? The person making the sexual-assault claim is a boy... The same boy that was hazed. The boy's saying he was raped? What, like, gang rape? From what I know, there was one alleged perp. S-so, they're saying Kevin did this? It's with s*x crimes. They're being tight on this. But, no, th-that didn't happen. It didn't happen because boys don't get raped. First of all, boys don't do that to other boys. And even if he could... The boys fight back. Wait. Are they even taking this seriously? The accuser's not looking too good. No GHB, pictures of him drunk don't help at all. ♪ Did you touch that boy?! What? At the party, did you touch some boy?! No! No! I did not! Did you put a hand on him?! No, I was with Val! That was it, dad! Nothing else! Nothing! [Panting] [Panting] Ken : Sexual assault is the hardest crime to prosecute. Most times, these investigations don't go forward. They just don't. Well, anything you find out, or anything you know, you tell us. Can't you do anything for us? [Sighs] How was Dr. Esposito? I don't want to talk about it. Well, I wasn't asking... I was... I just... Was it helpful? He said I should... Be honest with you with how I feel. You should. Evy came by today. She's, um... she's pissed because the police are showing up at her school. They had to talk to her. She was at the party. You said that thing in the paper would help. People know it's me. They can figure it out. They're... they're going online, they're saying stuff. I told you to stay off... Look, I didn't want to do this in the first place. It's why I don't tell you things... I... look. 'Cause you won't let me go. I only... I was just trying... You're on this guilt trip. Is that what you and Dr. Esposito talked about? We talked about me doing... What's right for me. So I... I don't want to deal with the police. I... I don't want to go to Leyland anymore. I want to go back to Marshall. I just want it to be over. Will you keep going to counseling? Can you promise me that? If you won't talk to me, I want you talking to somebody. Yeah. [Fork scraping] [Ice clinking] I want to do absolutely everything I can to help. Krasno : I appreciate that. But you understand, we're balancing that with the privacy of our students and their families. That article didn't make our job any easier. So, to do what we need to do, to do it in a way that's the least disruptive, I need your help generating a list of males who were at that party. For what reason? We'll be issuing warrants to these individuals for DNA samples. If we can't get a list, we'll have to subpoena every student in this school. [Clicks tongue] We're not gonna help you harass our families, not over some lurid story from a young man who got drunk. The testing's come back from Taylor Blaine's clothes. We found semen belonging to another individual. Someone ejaculated on Mr. Blaine. We also found traces of blood, indicating forced contact. ♪ We are officially looking at this as a rape.
