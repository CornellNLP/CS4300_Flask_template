 Six years ago, the Leyland School was blessed with the arrival of Dan Sullivan. 
 Four winning seasons, a state championship... 
 Ms. Blaine, we're suspending Taylor from school. 
 There were pictures posted of your son which were outside the code. 
 There was a party. It was for the basketball team. 
 He was  really  messed up. 
 We need to talk with Becca. 
 I do not want her at those parties. 
 Bitch looking good, huh? 
 D-damn. 
 Terri : $20,000 a year on that school. 
 You'd think he'd make better choices. 
 You  know  that girl is just... 
 Oh, I know you're not getting down on the sister. 
 Anne : What were you doing?! 
 I don't know! I don't know what happened! 
 I had a couple of beers. 
 Then everything got messed up. 
 I think someone did something to me. 
 A student is claiming to have been assaulted. 
 By one of my players? 
 Well, you know that's a lie. 
 Don't think your kids are above mistakes. 
 You need to talk to your players. 
 What are you doing about what happened to him? 
 We've taken disciplinary action appropriate to the circumstance... 
 What are you doing to those boys?! 
 Tell me what you're doing to the boys! 
 The suspension is fair. 
 As bad as it may seem, it can get worse. 
 Man : 911. What's your emergency? 
 I want to report a rape. 
 Roberts : Ms. Blaine? 
 Yes. 
 Did you call 911? 
 When did the assault take place? 
 Last Saturday. 
 You know the location? 
 Uh, it was a party. I'm not sure where. 
 Exact location's gonna be important to detectives, okay? 
 Victim's name? 
 Taylor. 
 Where's she now? 
 Taylor's my son. 
 The victim's a male? 
 Yes, my son. 
 And this is a sexual assault? 
 Yes. 
 Does your son know the assailant? 
 It was some other kids at the school. 
 One kid? More than one? 
 He doesn't remember. 
 He doesn't remember? Or he's not saying? he was drugged. He doesn't remember. 
 Gonna need to take your son to the hospital, get a rape kit done. 
 Sanders : Is your son here? 
 Yes. 
 Maybe he should come out and talk to us. 
 He doesn't want to. 
 If he's the victim, we need to speak to him. 
 He doesn't want to talk about it. 
 Look, if he's not going to help us, we can't help him. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Indistinct shouting, scattered applause] 
 Woman : We have so many schools that are struggling right now, that are underfunded! 
 And what do you guys want to do? Give them more breaks? 
 Cut their property taxes? 
 You all are supposed to represent the city. 
 Represent all of us. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Not them! 
 All right, that school is nothing but a bunch of rich, spoiled kids. 
 It's a... It's a segregation academy. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 It's ridiculous. 
 And you're trying to make it bigger? 
 I mean, they're trying to make this school bigger? 
 [Scoffs] The hell that they should get to do that! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 They're all... well, I'm not gonna say idiots... 
 You just said it. [Laughter] 
 May I take the opportunity to distance myself from the remark? 
 Stand there and say the first stupid thing that falls out of their mouths. God! 
 It is a space for public comment. 
 Where was the comment? 
 If they want to comment, comment. 
 They have nothing to say. 
 It's part of the process. 
 They're angry because they want to be angry. 
 Sometimes it's better to listen than antagonize. 
 Well, Leslie, you are supposed to be the voice of the school, and I see you just... Just sit there and take it. 
 [Chuckles] Let's focus on us, focus on what we're doing. 
 We have an amazing event coming up... 
 A remarkable evening that... 
 So we just sat through a train wreck, and you want to put on a dress and have a night out? 
 You have some curious priorities. 
 That night out is going to raise $3 million in one evening. 
 That's my priority. 
 Before we adjourn, I need to make the board aware of something that may or may not be an issue, but it should be a concern. 
 There was an allegation made against some of our students. 
 About what? 
 Nothing's been substantiated. 
 At this point, for everyone's sake, it's important to maintain anonymity. 
 Hold on. I... 
 Legal's been made aware. 
 Dan Sullivan's questioned his players, so all we can do is be diligent. 
 Beyond that, we'll make sure you're all informed. 
 Any other business? 
 That's it. 
 We're adjourned. 
 Thank you all. It's a good day's work. 
 Take care. Thank you. 
 Good to see you. 
 Take care. 
 You too. 
 I'll see you next week. 
 Bye-bye. 
 You need me to stay? 
 Uh, no, I need you to type that stuff up for me. 
 It's very important regarding this allegation that, on the record, we say the right things. 
 What's the problem, Leslie? 
 It was off campus. 
 The event wasn't sanctioned by the school, but there is some liability. 
 It could get very ugly. 
 So we need to do the right thing. 
 We need to say the right thing. 
 You keep repeating that... "Say the right thing." 
 There's the fact procedure and there's the rumor procedure. 
 Right now, we're dealing with rumor. 
 Don't publicize the rumor. 
 Promote the opposite of what the rumor says. 
 Provide proof to support promotion of the opposite. 
 What exactly happened, Leslie? 
 If this is about the basketball team, we can't af... 
 Dan talked to the team. No one's admitted anything. 
 We can discipline individuals for what we do know, but we can't be accountable for what we don't know. 
 There's nothing more to do right now. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Taylor : I don't want to go. 
 Anne : I know. 
 I don't want to talk to anybody. 
 It's... it's just to make sure you're okay, okay? 
 I just want it to go away. 
 That's what they want. 
 They want to act like it never happened. 
 It'll get better. I promise. 
 But it's not just gonna go away. 
 Nurse Wells: Taylor, my name is Nurse Wells. 
 I'm the forensic nurse that's gonna be working with you today. 
 So, I want to talk with you about how this process works. 
 But do you have any questions, just off the top? 
 No. 
 Okay. All right. 
 If anything comes up, please let me know, all right? 
 So, this is how this all goes. We start and end with paperwork. 
 As like everything else in the hospital, we start with paperwork and end with paperwork. 
 I'll talk with you about medications, too. 
 We've got antibiotics for preventing sexually transmitted infections. 
 And if that's something that you want to have, we'll get that for you while you're here. 
 Okay? 
 If it's all right with you, I'll draw some blood, too. 
 And we do that for a couple of different reasons. 
 One of them is for a toxicology screen. 
 Like, if somebody might have given you something to knock you out, it could test for that. 
 We also run a DNA test so that when everything goes to the lab, they can figure out what things belong to you and what things don't belong to you. 
 Those are the two reasons why we do that. 
 Most of the rest of the exam is talking. 
 You know, I will ask you to tell me what you remember about what was going on. 
 I'm gonna write it down. 
 It kind of helps me figure out what I need to be doing with the rest of the exam. 
 Why do you... Why do you need to do that? 
 Why... for what you do? Why do you... um... 
 Sorry. Just, what... why do you need that information? 
 There's a couple of different reasons. 
 One of them is because it really helps guide the exam. 
 If I know what you experienced, I know what things I need to look for and where I need to look for them. 
 The other reason why we like to get a history is because it can go into court. 
 If this ends up going to court, then I can read your words to the jury, and I think that can be a pretty powerful thing. 
 The last thing we'll do, if it's okay with you, is take a look at your anal-genital area for same reasons... Looking for any kind of injury in that area and also probably taking some swabs in case there might be any DNA to be found there, too. 
 And that's kind of the long and short of it. 
 Any questions so far? 
 No. 
 Next, I'd like to take a look at your a**l area. 
 So, again, I'm gonna touch on right hip, and come in towards the middle, and just kind of straighten out wrinkles in your skin right here. 
 And doing... Looking at the lower area. 
 And then looking up at the top area. 
 [Voice fading] Okay, so, hand back on right hip... 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 And moving in towards center, and fingers right in the middle, and you'll feel a swab right between my fingers. 
 [  Laughter ] 
 Drink this. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 Nurse Wells: Hey, Anne, why don't you come with me? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 It's important for you guys to follow up with H.I.V. testing. 
 H.I.V.? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't even... 
 I didn't even think that could... 
 Yeah, and of course not. Why would you think about that? 
 But in these kinds of situations, it's recommended. 
 So, if you have a doctor that you all normally see for things, that's great. 
 If not, I want to make sure that you get connected with the city clinic for those tests. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 I wanted to ask about the clothes that he was wearing that night and if he still has them. 
 Okay. 
 I-I think so. 
 Okay. 
 If y'all haven't washed them yet, put them in a paper bag and just tape it closed. 
 [Sighs] We did do wash. We did. 
 But I don't think they were in there. 
 No. 
 Okay. Put them in a paper bag, tape it closed, and then give those to the detective. 
 Oh. 
 Can I just bring them to you? 
 No. Evidence needs to go to the police. 
 I've already been to the police. 
 Did you talk to a responding officer or a detective? 
 I don't even know. 
 So, a responding officer's usually the person who comes out and just takes a statement. 
 [Sighs] 
 Normally you'll follow up with a detective later. 
 How many people do I have to talk to? 
 It's a lot. 
 [Turn signal clicking] 
 [Tires screech] [Gasps] 
 Man : What, you didn't see me? You didn't see me, huh? 
 Your dumb ass didn't see me? 
 You need to learn to drive, bitch. 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 Hey, you listening to me?! 
 Learn to drive! 
 [Dial tone] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Ringing] 
 Ken : Indianapolis police. Detective Williams. 
 Ken? It's Terri. 
 Terri, what's up? How's Michael? 
 Good. He's good. 
 Uh, listen, Ken, I got into an incident on my way in today. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 It's just, the other driver, he was... aggressive. 
 White guy? Black guy? 
 White, of course. Just really aggressive. 
 And I got a photo of his license plate, and I was wondering if you could do anything? 
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Send it through. 
 If anything pops up, I'll, uh... You know, we'll get into it. 
 Yeah? You'll take care of it? 
 Hey, you know what, Terri? For you... 
 I'll talk to you later, okay? 
 Thanks, Ken.

 If you want to take the shot, take it.

 Ooh! [Laughs] 
 Don't call it a comeback. 
 All right, let me see you dunk. 
 Yeah, "try." 
 I can't dunk. 
 Try. 
 "Just try." You're always telling me to just try... 
 Don't talk like that. 
 You talk like that at school? 
 I'll give you an alley-oop. 
 "I can't dunk," but you're gonna feed me an alley-oop. 
 [Laughs] 
 All right, so, let me tell  you  something. 
 You got to start taking care of yourself, okay? 
 You're 17 and you're starting to smell like you're 17. 
 I smell good, dad. 
 Yeah, well, you're at that age now where you're not gonna get with anybody if you don't start taking care of yourself. 
 Oh. 
 Ah. 
 Uh, well, you're divorced, so... 
 [Both laugh] 
 Peter : Oh, damn. [Indistinct shouting] 
 Okay, yeah. 
 All right. Don't stink. 
 Wash up, use deodorant. 
 Use a body spray, right? 
 Body spray... 
 Well, use it. It's like 101. 
 Yeah? Come on.

 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [School bell rings] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Hey, uh, bad time? 
 Just end-of-the-day housekeeping. 
 It's the kind of world we live in. 
 [Chuckles] Hey, uh, this is for you. 
 You... you said some very nice things about me at that fundraiser, and, uh, well, thank you. 
 Oh. All deserved. 
 Wow. How do you do this? 
 I know, I know. You can't tell me your secrets. 
 [Chuckles] Oh, you know, it's not magic. 
 It's just patience. 
 So, listen, Dan, we have to talk. 
 The incident that happened with the team, we need to close it out, and we need to do it in a way that, if it comes to it, people understand we took it seriously. 
 Okay. 
 You need to discipline one of your players. 
 For what? 
 For what happened at that party. 
 I talked to my boys. Nothing happened. 
 Something happened. There was drinking, there... 
 Have you seen the pictures the kids have been texting around? 
 Suspend the kids that are spreading that crap, but don't take it out on the team. 
 The mother of the boy has been in this office, and she's been using some ugly language. 
 Well, her kid got wasted drunk, you know, so she's got to blame somebody. 
 "Rape." That's the word she used. 
 That's insane. 
 And compared to that, we have to look thoughtful and responsible. 
 People think this school is about entitlement. 
 We have to promote the opposite. 
 If you make those kids look guilty, then next thing, people are saying they're guilty. 
 I know. You're concerned about their feelings. 
 No, this is not about their feelings. 
 If those boys want to go play ball in college... 
 If they even want to go to college... 
 Even one game, that stays on their record. 
 You're talking about one player. 
 I'm talking about the team. 
 And when people come and they ask us why we didn't do anything about the team, we did. 
 But if we're the ones deciding what we're going to do, then we can do what has the least impact. 
 You're being reactionary. 
 This is a little act. 
 One player, one game... to prevent more hurt elsewhere. 
 But there will be a notation in a file that says the player was sat for disciplinary reasons. 
 [Sighs] 
 Who am I supposed to sit? 
 Well, it was the captain's party. 
 Kevin? You want me to sit Kevin? 
 I don't think we want to get into things with the Lacroix family. 
 Who's the other captain? 
 Eric Tanner. 
 Whatever you decide, just put it in writing for me, please. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Everybody know about this? 
 No, not everybody. Mnh-mnh. 
 But people know. 
 It's one game. 
 And what about Kevin? He's the other team captain. 
 How come you're not doing anything to him? 
 Now we're... we're looking at each player individually. 
 Yeah, but you're coming at me. You're not coming at him. 
 So how's that fair? 
 One game. All right? 
 [Door slams] 
 Oh, hey, Eric. What's up, bro? 
 Want to get in on the game? 
 Eric. 
 Eric! 
 That little bitch said something. 
 It's nothing. 
 Well, it's nothing for you. 
 They're not doing anything to you. 
 I know he's running his mouth. 
 What's he gonna say? 
 He's not even in school anymore. 
 He could still pop off, Kev. 
 You're the one running your mouth, though, man. 
 You need to shut the hell up and let it be. 
 Like, let it go. 
 [Sighs] 
 I got you on this. 
 How you got me? 
 'Cause it's done. That's it. 
 After this, nobody's speaking on it. 
 Y... You just need to chill, man. 
 Do it for the team, all right? 
 And don't be a bitch about it. 
 Damn. 
 
 
 
 [School bell rings] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 I don't know. One of those... 
 [Laughs] 
 Come on, girl. 
 What's up? 
 Hey, yo, what up? 
 Lost? 
 Hey, st... 
 What? 
 Go roll up on your own. 
 Sean, no. Back off. 
 You guys, st... 
 Chris : Hey. 
 Do me better. 
 Hey. We got a problem? 
 Mateo, you got a problem? 
 Nah. 
 [School bell rings] 
 Then you need to figure out where you need to be. 
 You have class? 
 Yeah. 
 Then get to class. Let's go. 
 Everything straight with these two? 
 Boys being boys? 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 I want you to be mindful hanging out between class, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Get where you need to be. 
 Whoa. 
 You're already late. 
 Let's not get into an accident. 
 Monica : What you're doing is wrong, and it's cruel. 
 You're literally trying to take food out of children's mouths. 
 Nobody's trying to touch HHFK. 
 Okay, give kids a free breakfast... yes. 
 But it needs to happen before first period, not during first period. 
 Oh, we're talking about families of different means. 
 Getting their kids to school before class isn't practical. 
 Getting kids fed is directly related to how they perform in class. 
 Nobody's arguing about providing a meal for the kids. 
 A-all they're talking about is when it happens. 
 Well, that's the problem. 
 We're not just talking about feeding kids. 
 This is a civil rights issue. 
 [Sighs] 
 What, is that... is that funny to you? 
 A civil rights issue? 
 For me, for a lot of people in this room. 
 I don't see the attack dogs. I don't see the water hoses. 
 So what's the problem? 
 That the people being hurt don't look like you? 
 Or that little brown kids don't have rights? 
 We have a lot to cover tonight. 
 Does this even have anything to do with your school? 
 Not mine. 
 Ours. 
 We're supposed to be here to problem-solve. 
 So why don't we do that? 
 Days go by, year in and out. 
 And we're not talking about if we should be teaching Singapore math or if the reading levels are appropriate. 
 We are talking about what time to serve the kiddies food. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I have three degrees... Two of them from I.U... 
 And I feel like a fast-food manager as much as a superintendent. 
 And Monica... 
 Oh. She's fierce. 
 I like her. I really respect her. 
 But she's a bleeding heart. 
 HHFK... good intentions, poorly executed. 
 It's that simple. 
 But nothing's that simple. 
 I want to do something about it, and you speaking to it, it means something. 
 I'm just trying to run my school. 
 Our  schools. Isn't that what you said? 
 Why stir things? 
 Too many teachers, they just want to keep their mouths shut, heads down, let the Unions fight it out with the legislator. 
 That solves what? 
 That's politics. 
 How's politics working for students? 
 You need help with your budget. 
 I don't need help. 
 Okay, my school needs help, and you're talking about grabbing a third rail. 
 You're not gonna get anyone to back you. 
 I need you to back me. 
 If I can win a few battles, then I can fight some new ones. 
 Then we can all start winning. 
 Doctor... 
 I'm seriously not trying to get into this. 
 [Door closes] 
 What's up? 
 Terri : What's up? 
 Nothing. 
 Uh, Eric was talking about going to Chicago this weekend... 
 You have something you want to tell me? 
 Sit down. 
 Do you have something you want to tell me? 
 What is that? 
 Uh, [Clears throat] a receipt? 
 For what? 
 Do I really need to sit here and punk you? 
 I got her a gift. 
 Who? 
 Val. 
 You got her a $900 gift? 
 What, you thought I didn't check your credit-card receipts, or you thought I would be okay with you spending this kind of money? 
 Hey, she's my... she's my girl. 
 How long have you been seeing her? 
 I don't know. 
 A couple of months? Maybe? 
 What was it, Kevin? 
 A bracelet. 
 What did she promise you? 
 What did she tell you she was gonna do for that bracelet? 
 Nothing. 
 [Sighs] 
 We got into a fight. 
 Okay, so, you got her a slick bracelet, and because you were so slick, she got back with you and it was all good? 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you having sexual relations with her? 
 Mom, please don't say it like that. Why... 
 Well, how do you want me to say it? 
 Any other way but that one. 
 What, you roll up on her? Knocking the boots? 
 [Chuckles] Getting busy? 
 Nobody says any of those things. 
 That's what you all do? 
 No, she's... she's not like that. 
 Hmm, well, for $900, she could be. 
 That's how it's gonna be from now on. 
 Good looks, skills. You've got money. 
 There are girls out there, they're gonna be coming hard at you for that. 
 They're gonna be trying to be your baby mama just so they can get paid. 
 That's how they are. 
 And the last time Val was anywhere near $900... 
 Do you think I'm stupid? 
 Some of these girls out here are gonna hope that you are. 
 Then how am I supposed to know? 
 Well, does her family have any money? 
 Because if her family has money, then she doesn't want anything from you. 
 But these other girls, running around here, broke, talking about, "I want me some rocks, show me the rocks," I... 
 Those are straight hos. 
 You can leave those for the WTs, 'cause you're better than that. 
 You hear what I'm trying to say? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, now, you got to get it back. 
 Hm? 
 She doesn't get to keep a $900 bracelet. 
 But I gave it to her already. 
 What did you buy it with? 
 Mom, that's nothing to you. That's $900. 
 Are you serious? 
 You get it back, Kevin, and you get it back today. 
 If not, I will go over there myself with the police, because as far as I'm concerned, she stole it. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 The Avedon Arts Building? 
 The Avedon Library? 
 [Laughs] 
 The Avedon [Clears throat] Athletic Center? 
 I wasn't good at sports. 
 The Avedon Computer Science Center? 
 We know you're good at computers. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, your school's not really a priority for me. 
 I don't have kids. 
 These are all our children. 
 I don't need the fundraising speech. 
 It's not a speech. 
 It's rich kids going to a rich kid's school. 
 I went to a public school. I turned out okay. 
 This is an opportunity for you to start building your own legacy. 
 The name that goes on the building is yours, not your father's. 
 A million dollars for naming rights, for the right to put your name where it matters. 
 You know a good deal when you see one. 
 Yeah. I know a good pitch when I hear one, too. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay. Let me think about it. 
 Okay. 
 Then we'll talk. 
 You bet. 
 I'll take care of these. 
 Okay. 
 You know what? 
 I'm gonna go to that gala of yours. 
 Put me down for a couple of tickets. 
 Okay, I will. 
 [Mumbled] Son of a bitch. 
 He talked to me like I was 8 years old. 
 "I went to public school." 
 The only reason he went to public school is 'cause his dad was running for office. 
 Nobody votes for a politician whose kids are in private. 
 I love that if the kids you care about come from means, you're not supposed to care about them. 
 I mean, even someone with money thinks that. 
 I just... ugh... 
 Getting sick of the whole dance. 
 Resign. 
 I'm sorry? 
 Resign. 
 That's really your career advice? 
 Is being headmaster really your career? 
 Capital development is my profession. 
 But it's not your school, so what do you care if... 
 Well, I could say it's not your company, so what do you care, except you have a long-term contract. 
 If people at that place aren't interested enough to put money into it... 
 "That place"? 
 This... 
 Is not a good topic for me. 
 Never is. 
 I care about what I do. What I do is important. 
 Okay. 
 Here's the good news. 
 The goal is in sight. 
 Then I can learn to like New York and join you at your nameless, faceless, godless institution. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We gonna make it through the next year? 
 We gonna make it through the next year? 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 [Cash register beeping] 
 [Dan sighs] 
 Yeah, great. Fine. Good. 
 Well, I think she'd like it. 
 Look, whatever you get your mom, she's gonna appreciate it. 
 We should throw her a surprise party. 
 She doesn't like surprises. 
 I like surprises, so we should do it. 
 It is a big birthday for your mom. 
 I don't know if it's the one we should be experimenting on. 
 Hey, um... 
 So, your mom, she wanted me to have a talk with you. 
 And, you know, just, uh... 
 You know, just be mindful of guys. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey. Hey, come on. 
 You know, guys are gonna be coming at you, and, you know, you need to be... 
 You need to be smart. 
 Like use a condom? 
 No. 
 No, like... like don't do anything like it at all. 
 Well, it's kind of late for that. 
 To be talking about it. 
 I've seen p0rn. 
 That's where you think you learned about s*x? 
 Well, you didn't talk about it. 
 Hey, don't act all proud 'cause you got what you think you know from a website. 
 No, I got it from people who know what I'm going through, people my age. 
 Well, what are you going through? 
 Well, what are you going through? 
 I'm just... I'm just going through life. 
 Well, what does that mean... "I'm going through"? 
 I'm just going through life. 
 Okay, okay. Yeah, you're going through. 
 But so... don't just... Just don't... 
 Every other word... "Don't." 
 Do things just to do them. 
 Don't think some crap you see on the Internet or how other people tell you things are is... 
 It's not that big of a deal. 
 But it is a big deal. 
 Okay, it is a big deal if you do something wrong. 
 And not everybody gets that. 
 Did you see... you see those pictures that are going around? 
 The kid from school got drunk at the party? 
 Did you see that? 
 Yes. Everybody saw those. 
 Yeah, everybody saw those. 
 Everybody saw that he's a dumbass, and his life is ruined. 
 He got drunk. That's all. 
 $55.54. 
 Dan : Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right? 
 And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him. 
 Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him. 
 So, I don't know why you have to assume I'm gonna do something wrong. 
 I don't. I just... 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, come on. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Why did you show those pictures to my mom? 
 She already knew about them. 
 She kept texting me. 
 So? 
 Look, I didn't tell her nothing, 'cause I don't know nothing. 
 You should have been straight with her, first off. 
 Why would I tell her anything? 
 Because she's your mom. 
 And I'm supposed to be your girlfriend. 
 You don't talk to her. 
 You don't even talk to me anymore. 
 Look, I just don't want to talk about that. 
 Are you good? 
 I'm... I just said I'm not trying to... 
 I just want to know if you're good. 
 You can tell me that, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 Damn. 
 Anne : They keep blaming Taylor. 
 "Does he have a problem with drinking?" 
 "Does he have a problem with drugs?" 
 "Oh, just... just take him to see someone and go away." 
 Esposito : How's Taylor doing? 
 Depressed? 
 He's just sad. 
 Does he engage with you at all? 
 I got him to see a doctor. 
 But I-I-I think that scared him more than helped him. 
 There doesn't have to be a rush to deal with this. 
 Victims are allowed time to decide if they want to pursue their case. 
 Well, he waited to say anything, and... and they act like it's his fault. 
 I waited to tell the police, and they... they say, you know, you're negligent. 
 There's a time, there's a window, for victims, when they're ready to talk. 
 It might... 
 I'm saying, consider it might be better for Taylor to wait until he's ready. 
 So I should just leave it alone? 
 You should make sure that what you're doing is having a positive effect on your son. 
 How are  you  holding up? 
 Eh. 
 If you start feeling overwhelmed, if you feel stressed or anxious... 
 Yeah, yeah. I know the signs. 
 I'm fine. 
 Well, I'm not fine, but I'm okay. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 [Cellphone vibrates] 
 Damn. 
 Eric. 
 That thing is sweet. 
 Yeah. Wanna drive? 
 Serious? 
 Not gonna wreck it, are you? 
 Hell no, man. 
 Beat the hell out of that bitch, but I ain't gonna wreck it. 
 All right, then. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Engine revving] 
 [Laughs] 
 Ow! 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're just a rough boy, huh? 
 You a rough boy, Eric? 
 No. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Stop it! 
 Stop. 
 I don't like it like that, all right? 
 What do you like? 
 I just want to kiss. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, it's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Name? 
 My name or...? 
 Your son's? 
 Taylor Blaine. 
 Taylor. How old is he? 
 17. 
 And this is about last Saturday night... 
 The party? 
 Yeah. 
 The school's already been in contact with the department. 
 They gave us a summary of events, pictures. 
 That's your son? 
 Yes. 
 Was he drinking that night? 
 He did not get drunk. 
 Somebody put something in his drink. 
 Something what? GHB? 
 They drugged him. 
 His girlfriend was there. She saw him. 
 Why would they want to give him drugs? 
 They don't like him. 
 That's a lot of effort just because you don't like somebody. 
 Why would they want... 
 I don't... that's... that's... that's your job. 
 That's... 
 That's what you need to find out. 
 You really want to do this to your son? 
 My son was raped. 
 That's a specific category of crime. 
 Forced intercourse with a member of the opposite s*x. 
 What do you want to call it? What do you want to call it? 
 I don't care what you call it. I just need you to do something. 
 They... they were taking pictures, there was drinking. 
 They... they talked about him online. 
 You can't do something about that? 
 That's for the... 
 You can't do something with that? 
 That's for the school to handle. 
 Why? It's a crime. 
 Look... 
 Some of these kids are minors. Your son is a minor. 
 This is a lot to put them through. 
 Kids do dumb stuff. 
 Now, I'm not talking about your son, I'm talking about... 
 Look, I've got a 15-year-old. I know how it is. 
 I'd maybe... 
 If you think your son's got a drinking problem or something, you should really try to get him some help. 
 Okay. 
 [Door closes] 
 You go to these people asking for help. 
 [Ringing] The minute you start talking, you can see it. 
 They don't believe you. 
 They... they don't... they won't even call it what it is because they don't think it happens to boys. 
 Then I start doubting myself. 
 Maybe I got it wrong. 
 S-so I go online, and I find all these articles. 
 Schools, sports teams, boys getting assaulted. 
 It happens more than you think. 
 I mean, that... that school wants to hide it. 
 The police want to ignore it. 
 I shouldn't have to beg people to care about my son. 
 I'm gonna take some notes. 
 Tell me what you know, and if there's something there, I'll pursue it. 
 The only thing I ask... Can you not print my son's name? 
 I don't have to use his name. 
 But this article comes out, it's not gonna be hard for people to do the math. 
 They're gonna know where it's coming from. 
 So, before you say anything... 
 Are you sure you want to go public with this? 
 Yes, I am.
