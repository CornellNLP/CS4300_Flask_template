 I was thinking that maybe I could help fix up Matt and Gwen's place in exchange for staying there. 
 You want to sleep in the house where Matt was killed? 
 Are you sure you want to... stay here? 
 Yeah. 
 I do. 
 Sibila : You said you'd send for us. 
 You're too busy hustling to be there for me, for your own daughter? 
 Hector : You want me to talk on Carter? 
 I'm not saying nothing until I know you're for real. 
 What kind of gesture? 
 Get me someplace I'm protected. 
 Juvie ain't nothing. 
 Hang close, do how I do, and you'll be out of here in no time. 
 Hello, mom. 
 It's "mom" now, hmm? 
 Your father... God bless him... is an enabler. I'm not. 
 I've never tolerated the things that you've done. 
 I need you to get this to somebody. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The prosecutor making this a hate crime was punitive, not real. 
 You want confrontation. 
 We want a fair examination. 
 Man : What do we want? 
 Justice! 
 When do we want it? 
 Now! 
 What do we want? 
 Justice! 
 Man : [Amplified]  You are unlawfully assembled. 
 Disperse immediately! Now! 
 Justice! [Explosion]  Surge! [Women screaming] Go, go, go, go! Barb : I think I want a gun. Ben : For what purpose? [Sighs] Self-protection. Try this one. It's a revolver. [Trigger clicks] I'll take it. Remember, finger off the trigger till you're ready to shoot. W-whoa, whoa. Always keep it pointed downrange. Position. Remember, front sight. Center of mass. Press the weapon into the target. Lean just a little bit. All right, trigger when ready. Press smoothly to the rear. Yeah. Keep going. [Gunshots] [Gun clicks] [Gun thuds] You want to see how you did? All the shots to the head and the body are kill shots. That's good, right? Well, if your intention was to shoot to kill, that's very good. Want to do it again? Yeah. Won't forget! Never forget! [Indistinct shouting] Timothy: The prosecution has to prove that likely your brother did what he's been accused of. And if they can't, the case is dismissed. Yes. Now, they do have compelling evidence... Mr. Tontz's testimony. They have the gun now. A  gun, not Carter's gun. They can't put a gun in his hand. That works for us. So do the mistakes they made with the DNA evidence, a lack of an eyewitness to the crime. There's as good of a chance the judge will dismiss the case as carry it forward. The rally put a lot of pressure on these people. Never forget! [Indistinct shouting in distance] [Buzzer] [Birds chirping] [Blade snaps] [Sighs] [Inhales deeply] [Clattering] [Clatter] [Sighs] Hmm. [Ignition clicks, gas hisses] [Strumming off-key chords] ♪ Don't call me Kevin ♪ 
♪ dude, my name be Devon ♪ [laughter] ♪ I come from Wisconsin ♪ 
♪ but I ain't got no Johnson ♪ [laughter] Devon : All right, Edgar. That's enough. Come on. Hey, I'm releasing my frustration. I'm "inspired." [Laughter] Hey, don't grudge him, man. Hey, what rhymes with, uh, "Devon got no..."? "Devon think he slick." "Devon got no chick." Both : 'Cause Devon got no... [Laughter] Nelson: Hey, settle down. Devon : I've got it. That's enough, all right? Hey... off, man. You need to settle down. Come on. That's enough. Just... just give... [Murmuring] Yo, you better stay back! Take a knee. Put it down. Take a knee. Man : Hey, put it down right now! Man 2 : Come on, man. Come on. Let it go. Oh, you want to play, too? [Indistinct shouting] Try me! All right. Put the guitar down! No, try me! Try... Hey! Stay back! Clear the room! Clear the room now! Get them out of here! [Grunting] Get them out! Tony : Stop. [Indistinct shouting] Stop! [Indistinct shouting] Get them out of here! Turn him. Turn him. Let's go. 1, 2, 3. First time I came in here, I wasn't supposed to be here. People knew that. They treated me like a punk. Treated me like that 'cause I was one. And second time I came here, I wasn't a punk no more. Felt good. Ain't lying. People look at me, 16, like I am respect. I've always respected you. You were proud. That's different. So I got respect. [Scoffs] I earned my respect. You're my son, Antonio. And you will always be my son. I love you no matter what. So you... y-you can push me away, but I'm not going away. I'm here. Papi, I need you to get me out. Papi, They killed Edgar. Who? I'm not gonna make it if they send me to jail. I'm talking to the lawyer. I'm trying to get them to review the case. Do something else! What? What can I do? I need you to do more. Ohh. [Siren wailing in distance] [Knock on door] [Train whistle blows in distance] Hector : Adela. Es papi. Está bien, Adela. Es papi. Adela.  Ven. Mija. Ven. ÿSiempre te dejan salir así? Lo hacen porque necesitan  mi testimonio. Oyes mija, tu papi es alguien importante. [Chuckles] Nunca me contestaste. ÿDe qué? You want to talk about America, talk in English. Adela doesn't need to hear it. We could be together, you know. I could get a job. What kind? Technology. [Chuckles] What? I can. I-I'm not gonna fail this time. You didn't fail before. You just gave up. What about getting married? I mean, we get married, you guys could come with me... You and Adela. It would take us seven years for us to get our citizenship. It's all gonna work out. It's been five years since you ran off. Now I'm supposed to wait around seven more? W-well, we... We'll get some place in the mountains. I mean, us. Get a place in the mountains and get married and you get a technology job... Can it ever be regular for you? This is regular. No. No. It's regular for other people. Regular for you would be staying out of trouble for six months. Regular for you would be buying a decent shirt and going to work on the first day. Why you always trying to make it so big? Why can't you just please try to do some regular... Okay? It's all gonna work. It's all gonna work out. Come on,  papi. Eat it. [Chuckles] [Inhales deeply] [Gulps] [Giggles] [Indistinct conversations] [Door opens, closes] Ruth : I came here because you and I actually have a lot in common. We do? We both want what's best for our families. I-I know we have competing agendas... That doesn't even begin to describe what's... I know. I know that. But I... Is there someplace we can talk in private? No. [Inhales deeply] I think it would be good if my daughter and your brother weren't involved. Are we working from the same place? This is not some bad date they're on. It isn't. I-I know that. This is... [Stammers] I... [sighs] A-as much as I love Aubry, she's... Time after time, I think, "okay, she's hit bottom. She'll change." And then something else happens, something worse. I mean... From what I see, your daughter is a drug addict and a habitual liar. And your brother is a thief and an enabler. [Sighs] However it is, it's a bad mix. For either of them to survive this, it has to change. If you're talking about some sort of family intervention, now is not the time. No, this  is  the time. If your brother walks away after this hearing, then what? What happens if the two of them can be together? This is not about counseling or therapy. I need... I want you to help me get in to see your brother. To do what? To try t... To try something. Mr. Hayes. Hayes : Oh, was Tony willing to offer up testimony in the Carter Nix case? He didn't know anything. I can talk to you son next week. No, he needs help now. And I just picked up two more cases this morning. I have to get my son out of here, Mr. Hayes. He's hurting. He's scare... I'm talking to you! He's a good kid. I'm gonna give you some advice. And this is off the record. Get yourself a private defense attorney, someone who can focus on your son's case. You're representing him. I represent a lot of kids. I'm supposed to carry a max of 15 cases. I have 28. You need someone who can put in the hours. I can't afford that. That costs money. I don't have that kind of money. He's your son. Get it. [Birds chirping] Barb : She was the only other person up here who was anything like a friend. And in few hours, I go from finding out she's a raging bigot to her bleeding on the street. That's me. No, you're not the same. I... If I close my eyes, I see myself on the ground, bleeding. You feel what you feel for a reason, not because God told you we need to segregate. That's perverted. If it's perverted... It - it is. Well, what difference does it make how you end up there? Y-you know what the difference is? I'm in the same place she was. At least you care how you feel. At least it bothers you. And knowing that, knowing where you are, it's going to do things to you. You just have to hold on through the preliminary examination. Why can't we just go to trial? Ugh. It's another step. It has been four months! I say that like it's forever. But it's just been four months since I lost Matt. I... I... was tired when this whole thing began. I'm exhausted now. I'm starting to not even care what happens anymore. [Liquid pours] I just... I want something to happen. It's for my own protection. What is? It's registered. I have a license. It's my legal right. Forget it. I'm sorry. It's just... Someone threw a brick at my car... While I was in it. You're right. I'm here to support you. I know how to use it. Good. I'm glad. Nurse : All right, Gwen. So, today, we're gonna go ahead and take out the catheter. You're gonna feel just a little bit of sensation. So take a deep breath in... [Gwen inhales deeply] And go ahead and blow out. [Exhales deeply] Good. Good, good, good. That's all done. So, now, when you take her home, you can go ahead and use adult diapers or a brief, all right? Okay. If you guys want to help? Sure. [Tom clears throat] Okay. All right. Now, let her do what she can by herself. Okay. Good. Very good, Gwen. Now, she will need help in the bathroom, so let's go into there and let's practice a few times, okay? Yeah. Eve : We both need to learn how to do this. I mean, it's not like when she was a baby. Diapers? I can't do this alone, Tom. T-there's nothing more I want than to have her home, to have her with us. I know. But I need more time. There isn't any more time. She's ready to come home. [Sighs] The things that happened, do they really matter now? I mean it. Do they matter? That's not what bothers me. No, the past is past. And you can really say that? I say it, I mean it. I just need to figure out what we're all about so that the same bad choices are not repeated. Well, there really isn't any math for that. So whatever we need to figure out, let's do it. But we need to get Gwen out of this city. We need to get her home. You brought her here? You know her? Never met her. Will you talk to her? Why? Because she has something to say. I wouldn't bring her here if I didn't feel her truth. I got nothing to say to her. Then just listen. Let her talk. Fine. Hello. How's Aubry? She's alive. Does she ask about me? Tell her, w-when all this is over, it's gonna be me and her again. I-I-I'm gonna take care of her. The way you took care of her this time? I called help for her. I gave myself up for her. And you feel good about that? You called 911 after she was overdosing, after you got into a fight with drug dealers. You do the little bit you can and you're proud of yourself? The way you two are, is any of this normal or good? She's good with me. W-when we're together, we're... You're almost dead in a cheap motel. That's what you were. But you felt like a hero. You felt you did what you had to do to save her, and it felt right trading your life for hers. You say you love her. Look, it's not just talk. Then let her go. Be without her. She's my girl. She's my daughter. My little girl is dying. The girl you say you love is dying. Please, help me save her. Alonzo : The, uh... the ceilings, they're... they're 12-foot high. Raul : Lot size? 17,000. So you're asking for $5, $6 per? Yes. Customer base? 100, 200 regulars. I-I don't have an exact count. If I take over a business that's up and running, I want that verified. I'm happy to share the books. Not past customers. Current. I know about the problems you've had recently. My customers are loyal. Looks pretty slow to me. It's a slow day. I'll take it off your hands for $50,000. I'm asking $90,000. As a hardworking "illegal," $50,000's the best I can do. [Train whistle blowing in distance] Could you go $85,000? You want to sell it fast, I'll buy it fast. $50,000, cash. Don't worry. It's not drug money. [Engine turns over] 
 
 [TV chatter] [Chuckles] Oscar : So, you want some tea? Uh, a beer would be all right. Sure. I made some calls today. A private defense attorney is $300 an hour plus an up-front retainer of $10,000 for investigators and interviews. So, they give you an idea what the total would be? Well, if Antonio's case is resolved quickly, it could be $15,000, $20,000. It could be $50,000, $100,000. I don't even know. [Dog barks in distance] I showed Raul Seravia my shop today. What? Yeah. Did he make you an offer? Yeah. Yeah. But not a good one. I need the money. God, I... up. [Sighs] No,  carnal. Y-you just did what you thought was right for Tony. But it didn't help him. I didn't save him. Look, let me talk to Raul, all right? I mean, he's a good businessman, but he's a good man, too. And... There's some lawyers that we do some advocacy work with. They might not charge you so much up front. [Speaks Spanish] Okay, you can talk to him. [Indistinct conversations] [Indistinct shouting] Crowd chanting : "Free Carter Nix!" [Metal detectors beeping] Crowd chanting : "Justice for all!" Bailiff : All rise. The honorable judge days presiding. Please be seated. Where's Mark? Judge days : This is the time and place set for the preliminary examination in the case of the state of California vs. Carter Nix, case number A154231. Mr. Nix is present. Are all counsel ready to proceed? Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor. I would like for it to be understood that these proceedings are to determine whether probable cause exists to bind Mr. Nix for trial for capital murder. Based on the tangled route this case has traveled, both the prosecution and the defense have a lot to prove. Although both sides would clearly like a speedy resolution to this hearing, because of the profile of this case, I intend to take my time in weighing the evidence. Is that clear? Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor. Call your first witness. [Man coughs] The people call Hector Tontz. [Door opens, closes] [Man coughs] You do solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in the matter now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yes, ma'am. Please take the stand and be seated. State your full name and spell your last name for the record, please. Hector Tontz. T-o-n-t-z. Rick : Mr. Tontz, on September 15th of last year at 11:45 in the evening, were you in the location of 5608 Lombard Avenue in Modesto? Yes. I was cruising around that night and... I got a text from Carter Nix. And what did that text say? [Heart beating] [Buzzer] [Door opens] [Door closes] Ms. Taylor. Who are you? Tim Little, Carter's attorney. How is he? He does all right. Uh, w-w-what happened at that hearing thing? He asked me to handdeliver this to you. [Paper slides] What is this bull... I'm sorry. I want to see him. No, I-I want to see Carter. Stop. He would never do this! Hands off! He... he promised! Calm down. Calm down. Please! Please! You made him do this. Calm down. No, you can't! [Door opens] Get off me! Aah! [Grunts] Calm down! Hey, just relax! [Breathing heavily] Carter. [Insects chirping] Russ : F-forgive the mess. Mm-hmm. [Breathes deeply] It's really coming along. Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm getting there. Um... is there... I-is there any indication at all from the judge? No, she meant what she said. She's gonna take her time with it. Mm. [Sighs] What? Did you know Barb bought a gun? A gun? No. Really? [Stammers] If there's one person in the world who should not have a gun, it's Barb. When this all plays out, Carter could be released. Oh, I doubt, uh, that. It's possible. Barb, she's... she's an intense person, but Barb... I mean, she'd never shoot anybody. No, no, no. I mean, she just - she wouldn't. I'm not worried about her shooting someone else. Well... I mean, no, obviously she's upset, but... She's... I mean, she's not like that. Well, I never thought I was like that, either. When the man who killed my daughter got that joke of a sentence, I bought a gun, taught myself how to use it. To kill? I picked out a spot where my husband wouldn't be the first person to find me, somewhere outside where I wouldn't make a mess. Had music on my iPod. I really, uh... I-I set it up good. I can't see you as that kind of person. What's the type? What's the type, except you can't stand what you're going through anymore? You know, it w... it was so easy to put that gun up to my chin, easy right up to pulling the trigger. But you have to be strong to do that. I wasn't. Barb is. Have you, um... H-have you talked to Barb about this? No. Uh, you should. I don't think it's my place. Our, um... Our lives weren't always this bad. S-s-she should remember that. Then maybe you should remind her. You're doing a good thing here. Hmm. Aubry : Just get Carter's lawyer. Ruth : No. I just need a few minutes with him. I won't do it. Where's dad? Oh, "dad." When you need him, it's "dad." And when you don't... Please. I need Carter to tell me why he tore the picture. Why do you think? I need him to tell me why. He's done with you. I'll never ask you for anything ever again. I swear to God. It's not healthy. Please. I believe that, you father, Carter's sister... You talked to Aliyah? Did you talk to Carter? You talked to Carter, and he did this. It's for the best. I want to talk to my lawyer. He will not facilitate any communication between you and Carter whatsoever. I'm gonna send Carter a message. I want to see someone from the D.A.'s office and that detective. Bring them all in here. We appreciate you wanting to work with us. But based on your prior exhibitions, we would like to get directly to your testimony. If the things you tell us have value, then we'd still be open to a plea agreement. This is the gun used to kill Matt Skokie. Hector Tontz testified that Carter Nix had it in his possession. Did Carter use this to murder Matt Skokie? That's the gun. But Carter didn't use it. I used it. I shot Matt. I shot his wife. Ohh. Hold on. Michael : What are you doing? I shot them. Stop it. Stop this. I need a moment alone with my client. Ruth : She's lying. I'm not lying. Listen to me. Let me help you, please. She's an habitual liar. This is what she does. Rick : No, no, no. Get something to record this. Michael : Aubry, stop it. Aubry, please. I'm telling them what I'm telling them. Warren : I advise you not to. I don't care what you advise. I'm telling them what I'm telling them. If you do this, I am done with you. I mean it. I'm done. Oh, then go. My client is obviously distraught. Just give us two minutes alone to discuss... Can I fire him? Ruth : You're being foolish. Oh, you can go, too. Rick : He works for you. You're fired. You're done. Get out. [Sighs] Just go. Michael. [Sighs] [Inhales deeply] I'm staying. [Door closes] [Beep] [Clears throat] The statement of Aubry Taylor is taking place at the Stanislaus County Psychiatric Center. Present are Deputy District Attorney Soderbergh and myself, Detective Quinn. Aubry Taylor's mother... Ruth. Ruth is also a witness. Ms. Taylor has previously been advised of her rights and has waived the right to have counsel present. Is that correct, Ms. Taylor? Yes. All right, Aubry, let's start at the beginning. You have specific information to share with us regarding the events of September 15th of last year. Yes. Carter Nix went to this one dealer's house. The dealer's name? Matt Skokie. Do you know his address? Somewhere on Lombard. 5608 Lombard Avenue? I guess. Mm-hmm. For what reason did Mr. Nix go to this address? Carter went to score drugs. And Hector Tontz drove him. I guess. What happened? Tried to negotiate, got hectic. Carter was short on funds, so Skokie told him he'd give him drugs if I blew him. Carter was like... that. Stole some cash, credit cards, took off. But you weren't there? No. Hmm. What happened next? Carter comes back, tells me how Matt Skokie was all "(Muted) this" and "(Muted) that," "(Muted)... your white bitch." Carter didn't do anything. He's too cool to care. He tells me what this racist b*st*rd's saying, so  I  went to settle. You went to 5608 Lombard Avenue? Whatever the address was, it was Skokie's place. At what time? 11:45... around there. Alone? On foot? You couldn't have made it from your place to the crime scene to fire a shot in that time frame. Weren't at our place. We were shacking the night with this dude, Everett. Everett's got some pieces laying around. Him, Carter are passed out. I'm like, "I'm gonna go get some business handled." I took the gun. Carter's gun. Everett's gun. Rick : Where do we find Everett? Hell if I know. The guy floats. If you find him, I can I.D. him. Did you take this gun with you with the intent to shoot either Mr. Skokie or his wife? Only for protection. That guy was violent. I wanted it if things got out of hand, which they did, big time. Keep going. I swapped s*x for drugs with Matt before, so I used that to get back in. Mr. Skokie let you back into his home? Yeah. His wife wasn't putting out... Not for him, anyway... So he was always pretty hard up. An easy play. Matt and me started negotiating all over again. Was there sexual contact? Was there...? That the question? Yeah, he was for sure trying to get some. Then his wife came in, screaming her head off. This was Gwen Skokie? Matt was real rough with her. Practically wrung her arm off flinging her back into the bedroom. Bruised her arms up. Mm, I hate seeing guys do women like that. I've been on the bad end of enough of that. So I tried to split. Matt wouldn't let me. He wouldn't let you leave? [Voice breaking] No. He wrung my arm, just like he did with her. When I fought back, h-he punched me, shoved me down, s-started tearing my clothes off. [Scoffs] It was like my brother and his friends attacking me all over again. So I fought back the only way I could. Which was how? I shot him in the face. I didn't mean to do it. It was self-defense. When his wife heard the shot, she came running out of the bedroom at me with something in her hands. Do you know what that was? All I knew was it was big and gnarly enough to kill me, so I... I shot her, too. Then I split. Took the gun, threw in in the Merced River. That's where you found it... Somewhere around there, right? [Breathes deeply] Went to a liquor store, got a PBR. They probably got a video of me or something. [Sighs] [Beep] [Knock on door] Hey. What? Uh, can I come in for a minute? You know where this goes. Just for a minute. I found some photos at Matt's house I want to show you. It's like looking at pictures of somebody else's family. It wasn't all bad. No. Part of my 12-step for my gambling addiction was to admit fault for the mistakes I made. Okay. Can you ever accept that? I can't even understand it. You're the one that started me gambling. F-first time I ever gambled with you... Quarters at video poker at the California Hotel in Vegas. Yes. And from that dollar, I got you addicted. No. Well, I-I was sitting there with you all night. You could take $20 and turn it into eight hours of gambling. It was just meant to be fun. It's always fun when you're winning. You never understood how to play the machines. You'd get these random draws, and you'd always hold the kicker. You can't play a double-double bonus like it was a deuces wild. That's the Barb I love. Video poker and an all-night buffet... That's all she needed. Oh, we could have had fun. But you got greedy with your gambling. Not greedy. Yeah, you were greedy. You wanted to win all the time. That's not how gambling addiction works. It's not about the money. You lost enough of it. You stole enough. You know, I'm at the tables... Forget video poker. I'm at the tables and the dealer's got an ace showing. You're supposed to play like he's got a face in the hole. I just know I can bust him or watch him turn a 7, then draw a 3 on the crap pair of 8s I'm holding and collect. I'm sitting there, money on the felt, and I know I can do it... Same with roulette. Every other sucker's placing wide, I lay the action numbers. And I can make the ball land winner. Make  it land. Now they're sliding over my chips. Don't matter if it's $10 or $10 million. I did that. The universe, the odds, everything that said it couldn't happen... I  made it happen. Control. Mm. No, good Russ Skokie has all the power in the universe to make the ball drop black 13. And I felt that way before I got sober. You can't control the universe. You can't even control what's going on here. Matt needed you, and you weren't here. And I have to live with that. We all have to live with the things we've done. We got to live, Barb. I'm grateful for all you did for Matt and Mark. I know it wasn't easy... All the tough choices you had to make. But whatever good things the boys had, they had because of you. Remember that. [Door opens, closes]
