 I've been trying to reach out to Condola, but I haven't heard anything. 
 You know there's something I... I just wanted to talk to you about. 
 Take it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 ♪ You gon' have to work for it ♪ My headliner dropped out, and I found this artist that's repped by Live Nation! 
 So, you think you can ask Andrew to hook me up? 
 I guess I could ask. 
 Work that pillow talk, girl. 
 ♪ Now baby let's play tag ♪ I've never been in a relationship long enough to have to balance it in my life. 
 You are my main priority. 
 What'd he say? Um, I didn't ask him. 
 What does that mean? 
 This relationship is really important to me, and I want to protect that. Does that make sense? 
 Uh-huh...

 Hey. Hey. 
 Is it weird that I called? You meant call, right? 
 Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah, that's what, that's what I meant. 
 Okay. 
 So, you know, do I get the VIP hookup at this block party or, you know, I got to stand in line with all these other nobodies? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I mean, you know. 
 I did give you the idea. Okay, calm down. 
 You good? Mm-hmm, I'm straight. 
 Um, anyway, thank you so much for your help. 
 Yeah, anytime. How you feel about tomorrow? 
 You know, scared I shut down Market Street for no reason, that none of the artists will show up, and it'll be the one day that it rains in LA, but other than that, chill. 
 So what are you doing up? 
 Oh, you know, just catching up on my stories. 
 I got the whole place to myself. Andrew's over at your girl's. 
 I don't know if I'd call her my girl. 
 Oh, like, y'all okay? 
 I don't think so. 
 The last time we talked wasn't great. 
 And sh1t has been buildin' up for a while. 
 Honestly... 
 I don't f*ck with Molly anymore.

 I mean, what do you even wear to a block party in January? 
 In LA? What you'd wear any other time. 
 It is 75 degrees. 
 With a 10 percent chance of rain. 
 I'm not tryin' to get sick. 
 And you know, when we won that NewCo case, that bitch did not come to my celebration dinner. 
 I pre-ordered a seafood tower for four. 
 That is a lot of mercury for three people. 
 Hm, so you're gonna punish her by leaving her hanging. 
 Maybe. 
 Let's not go. 
 Of course we have to go. Then what are we doing? 
 I love her, but I just... 
 I just don't really like her right now. 
 Well, I bet we'll have fun. 
 So why don't you get dressed? 
 We both know you're gonna wear that leotard. 
 It's a jumpsuit, Andrew.

 Came off? How? Doesn't matter. 
 There are extras right behind the play area. 
 Just don't put the broken one back, please. 
 I ain't gonna hold it. 
 Just give it to me. 
 Jesus. Excuse me, excuse me. 
 Y'all have got me way too close to the stage. 
 Bass gives me anxiety. 
 Okay, we'll move you back. Uh, this is my intern, Quoia. 
 She'll help you right out. 
 Executive assistant. I'll be right with you. 
 Thanks. Table leg acquired. 
 How come no one's here yet? 
 Well, the event just started 17 minutes ago. 
 They comin'. 
 And that's why there's blood on my hands, blood on my heart. 
 If you start to see the difference in me. 
 It's a tragedy. 
 Uh-uh, today is not about oppression. 
 Get her ass down. Copy that. 
 That's a ban on the Badu. 
 Sisters, sisters, never knew how much I missed ya. 
 SWV, sisters with voices. 
 Sisters got choices. 
 Oh, and I'm selling purses in the back. 
 Uh, hey. You're here. 
 Mm-hmm. Um, Rob from Spotify is running a little behind, but he said he'll be here in 15 with the giveaways. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 And thanks for all your help providing the interns. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 Because you kind of just peaced out, and... 
 I didn't even know you were coming. 
 I wasn't sure that I was. 
 Lawrence didn't tell you? 
 Tell me what? 
 That we broke up. 
 Oh, I didn't... no, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. 
 It is what it is. 
 Look, I'm sorry that I disappeared on you. 
 I just came to check in with these vendors. 
 Everything looks really great, Issa. 
 Thanks. 
 So sorry to interrupt, but good news. 
 Black people are taking photos by the step and repeat. 
 Oh, oh, wait. 
 Niggas always steppin' and repeatin'. 
 I gotta run. 
 I'll see you around? 
 Sure. 
 Uh... 
 Kelli, it's not your personal photo shoot. 
 You're hogging the red carpet. 
 Nobody else is here. Uh, I can hear you. 
 Lord, her legs are sturdy. 
 She's been doing this for 45 minutes and no one knows why. 
 Issa, get your ass over here. 
 Oh, I really shouldn't be takin' pictures. 
 Okay, no more than three. Okay. 
 Tiff, come on. Whoo. 
 We gonna do happy, sexy, then a jail pose. 
 Okay, fine. Happy. 
 Sexy. 
 Jail. 
 Old! 
 Shut the f*ck up! 
 I'm sorry, I'm, I'm tired. 
 Stay in school. 
 Thanks for coming, you guys. 
 I'm sorry it hasn't popped off yet. 
 So many white people showed up, but I have faith in us. 
 Are you kidding? I'm just happy to be having fun. 
 Leave the baby at home. 
 I should leave her at the supermarket one day. 
 Where is the frosé? This is so nice. 
 I used to be like, "She wants to do what? 
 "Why? Where? How? 
 And for what purpose and then again why?" 
 Yeah, I was there. Oh, but, girl. 
 You made this happen. 
 I mean, this is awesome. 
 I'm just glad you always believed in me. 
 Oh, I've always believed in you, love. 
 You've got that American entrepreneurial spirit. 
 What, what are you doing? 
 Um, my new beau, Darnell, is showing me Los Angel-eese. 
 I faked an accent when we met and now I have to commit. 
 Don't make it weird. Darnell, darling! How you doin'? 
 Please meet my dear friend, Issa Dee. 
 Hi, nice to meet you. 
 Hello! 
 I mean, hey. 
 I'm American, Kelli's British. 
 Now, that is a fact. 
 What do you call those? 
 Tacos? A tac-oh. 
 A taco. That is so cute. 
 Hey, did you know Lawrence and Condola broke up? 
 Condola didn't tell me anything. 
 But I've been on maternity leave. 
 Derek, did you know? No. 
 And actually, I'm offended. 
 That nigga usually tells me too much. 
 Issa, can I steal you for a second? 
 Please tell me Vince Staples is here. 
 I'm sorry, who's Vince Staples? 
 If he so much as looks at me, I'ma leave Darnell. 
 Well, still no word on that, but the press want to talk to you. 
 That's great news. Did y'all hear that? 
 I'm about to meet the press. Ah, cheers. 
 So you eat it with your hand? 
 Tell us what inspired you, Issa. 
 I just wanted to create a space for us, you know, where, where black excellence can be on display. 
 And what a diverse crowd. 
 Uh-huh, and I am fine with that. 
 You know, the neighborhood is just changing so quickly and this is a chance to support and uplift our community. 
 Our businesses, our food, our music. 
 Well, we can't wait to see how it goes. 
 Thanks, Issa Dee. 
 Thank you so much for comin' out. 
 No problem, so we're gonna stick around and shoot some B-roll. 
 Okay, where can I see the interview? 
 On my YouTube channel. Oh. 
 What's it called? I haven't started it yet. 
 But you hired a full camera crew? 
 I wanted to make it look official. 
 Well, I believed it. Good. 
 Anyone else wanna talk to me? 
 No. 
 Okay, it's early.

 Hey. Hey. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I didn't think you were coming. 
 Of course I came. I'm your best friend. 
 Of course. 
 Hey, sis. Hey, bro. 
 You hear it's supposed to rain? Mwah. 
 You worried? Shut up, Ahmal. 
 What's up, Molly. Hey. 
 Should we find our spots? 
 Hello, Ahmal. 
 I know. I saw you. 
 Yeah, I saw... I saw your shirt. 
 Hello to your shirt. Not you.

 So, Kelli, remind me. 
 What part of England are you from again? 
 I am from Poppycock. 
 It's in south central London, just a biscuit's toss and a fanny away from Benny Hill. 
 Wow, sounds beautiful. I know. 
 It does. One more question. 
 What are your thoughts on Brexit? 
 Brexit is boring. 
 Why don't we learn about the American government system? 
 What's that all about? Okay, so over here, we got two branches of government. 
 The first is the presidential branch. 
 Hm. And then the second is the bank branch. 
 It's called Bank of America. 
 Oh, wow. Is that, what? 
 It's like where they make all of America's money. 
 That's why there's so many of them. 
 That is unbelievable. 
 Yeah, it's pretty cool. It's incredible. 
 You're special. He is special. 
 You are not. 
 Have you, oh, I don't know, thought about drowning yourself? 
 Right after you. 
 British humor is really interesting. 
 It is very, it's complicated. Yeah. 
 Like your brain. 
 Wait, she keeps crying? What have you tried? 
 Yeah, yeah, sometimes she just don't f*ck with Peppa Pig. 
 Put her on. Hey, babe. 
 Wow, you are really not happy. 
 Okay, okay, we'll be home soon. Yeah, yeah. 
 Bye. Babe, we should go. She won't stop crying. 
 Can you just go? I'm finally out. 
 Okay, so I guess I'll just relieve the sitter. 
 You want me to leave the car? 
 It's fine, I'll ride with Kelli. Bye. 
 Aw, you're staying? Yes. 
 Derek's the best. He's the best dad. 
 But we gotta get you some ass. Or some dicks. 
 What are you into? Player's choice.

 He's posting pictures from Miami and I really hope they're later-grams.

 Yeah, of course, man. Leonard, this is my girlfriend, Molly. 
 Molly, this is Leonard, Vince Staples' manager. 
 Oh. I'll see you in the back. 
 Yeah. Cool. Oh, and thanks for the hookup tonight. 
 You were right. I love it. 
 What, what did you hook up? 
 Oh, I connected him with Issa. 
 You did? Nathan was the one who asked me to. 
 All I did was send an email. 
 Nathan? Okay, but you know we're not cool right now. 
 Yeah, but I didn't think that you'd be mad that I helped your best friend. 
 What's the issue? 
 This was amazing, Issa. You did it! 
 Thanks to you, Quoia. I'm so glad you were on my team. 
 But for real, you should go to the hospital. 
 I don't have health insurance, but okay. 
 Okay. Should she be driving? 
 I don't pay her. I can't police her. 
 Bye. 
 Drive safe, girl. 
 Can I talk to you? Yeah. 
 Did you tell Nathan to talk to Andrew? 
 About Vince? 
 I did. 
 Nathan reached out about the block party and I needed help. 
 So... But we had a conversation. 
 I know, and I didn't involve you. 
 Yeah, but you still got my man to do you a favor. 
 And it all worked out, right? 
 That's not the point, Issa. 
 You deliberately went behind my back. 
 I mean, I was very clear about how I felt, but I guess, what? That didn't mean anything to you? 
 Because, Molly, you were willing to let me fail over what? 
 Some random rule you made up? 
 It wasn't random. I was setting boundaries. 
 Molly, you knew how much this event meant to me. 
 You saw me at We Got Y'all, you saw me struggling, and you decided your new relationship was more important than doing me one little-ass favor. 
 Nigga, you stay needing one little-ass favor. 
 Why are you doing this at my event right now? 
 Is it that serious? Hey, hey. 
 You don't gotta do this, guys. We were just having a good time. 
 Yeah, I mean, I was over there wobblin' with your shady ass meanwhile you were stabbing me in the back? 
 Stabbing you in the... Molly. 
 This is OD. I don't have time for your drama. 
 Okay? You keep startin' sh1t. 
 You keep makin' up problems. 
 You keep focusin' on sh1t that I need to fix when you need to fix your f*ckin' self. 
 Bitch, do you hear yourself? 
 Nobody has more drama than you, Issa. 
 Okay, you need to figure out your sh1t and stop using people. 
 You used Nathan, Andrew, me. Who else? 
 Guys, let's not do this here. See? 
 You are so miserable. 
 If things don't work out with Andrew, it's not gonna be because of me, girl. 
 f*ck you. f*ck me. 
 I been stopped f*ckin' with you. 
 I should have dropped your lyin' ass a long time ago. 
 You still the same selfish bitch you always been. 
 Molly, get your finger out of my f*ckin' face. 
 What you gonna do? What's she reaching for? 
 She got a gun! 
 Who's got a gun? Is it a knife? 
 Is it a wallet? This is my life. 
 Niggas can't have nothin'! 
 sh1t, come on, let's go.

 Yo, just checking in on you. 
 Hey, morning after update. 
 What happened with y'all? 
 Hey, this baby won't stop crying. 
 Why you reaching for my titty? Ain't nothin' in there. 
 Is that a Wheat Thin? 
 So, what am I supposed to do now? 
 Relax, relate, release. Take care of you. 
 Okay.

 If y'all want any of this Pinot, let me know. 
 Yes, please. 
 Hey. Have you called Molly yet? 
 Let her reach out to you. She's wrong too.
