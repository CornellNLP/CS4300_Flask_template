 MAN: So I'm currently dating this fine young thing, I'm trying to make it official, but it pisses me off because every time we go out I always gotta pay for sh1t. 
 Which is fine, because I got a job.

 There have been some concerns, and I get it, but before we commit to a new design, I want to discuss the old logo so we don't make the same mistakes. 
 We have money to hire a designer? 
 JOANNE: No, the designer is my niece. 
 She's a senior at the Pratt Institute, so how lucky are we? 
 Thoughts? 
 Well, it's not great that there is a white hand scooping up black kids. 
 Yeah, in this climate that comes off a little racist. 
 JOANNE: It wasn't racist when I made it. 
 It's my hand. 
 My hand's helping the community. 
 It's not a handout, it's a hand out. 
 I hate to be that guy, but in a post-"Moonlight" America don't you think we should incorporate a rainbow? 
 Right? 
 Also there's two boys and only one girl. 
 Hello? 
 Time's up. 
 I've always thought that it's a little insulting that we're servicing black and brown kids and our name is "We Got Y'all." That's grammatically incorrect. 
 How about "Let Us Help You In Your Community In Really Positive Ways And Go For Happiness." I wasn't trying to insult anyone with the name. 
 I was trying to be relatable. 
 Relatable is good, but maybe we can find new ways to do that. 
 Honestly, whatever Issa thinks is probably right. 
 Oh, so now y'all wanna be woke when a bitch been an alarm clock since day one? 
 Well, "beep, beep," M*therf*ckers! 
 Beep!

 Um, I think you guys made some really good points, and I agree with everything you said, and I thank you for saying it.

 [SCOFFS] 
 Look, long-term, I could set you up with a credit counselor here, and I will help you plan out a budget. 
 But right now, you don't have enough money to move out on your own. 
 Kelli, I gotta do something. 
 I told Daniel I'd only be staying there a few weeks, and I don't want to take advantage of that. 
 Well, if it'd make you feel better, then you could throw him a few extra bucks. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You know...

 he's not charging me to stay. 
 I'm sorry.

 Damn, you're gettin' over. 
 I mean, if Daniel will let you stay a little longer, you should, just to save money. 
 Don't look a gift horse in the dick. 
 That's not a saying. 
 It is. 
 My grandmother said it to me. 
 It's like you do so well, and then you don't. 
 Do you think I should f*ck Warren?

 Don't you got other chicks to bother? 
 Tryin' to give my homegirl some space. 
 She got some sh1t she gotta sort out, so... 
 Well, I'm going to Skybar tonight, so you might have to crowd homegirl. 
 Yeah, I'm supposed to go to the show tonight at Fais Do-Do. 
 Ugh. 
 Fais Do-Do is so tired it literally means "go to sleep." Yeah, but I gotta go meet this artist Spyder there. 
 It's so thuggish up in there. 
 Right, but I mean, you know, dude's music is kinda dope. 
 - Could be a good look.

 Joanne? 
 How defensive she got. 
 It's like, "Sorry. 
 Just accept your logo's super-racist." Yeah, and more importantly, ugly. 
 That was my main concern. 
 I just don't want We Got Y'all to come off as tone-deaf right now. 
 How we're perceived will definitely affect our funding. 
 Yeah, the schools I called brought up a ton of issues. 
 It's not just the logo. 
 I get that we don't want to lose our donors, but the schools are always gonna complain about something. 
 Yeah, but that doesn't mean their complaints aren't valid. 
 Well, if it's an issue for some people, maybe those people who it's an issue for should have spoken up. 
 Really? 
 I have to speak up about every issue. 
 Do you know how awkward that is?    
 "Hi, I'm Issa, and I'm black and angry!"

 Do you have a preference on the ply? 
 Uh, I'm cool with whatever. 
 OK. 
 Easy on the ply. 
 Anyway, so, I talked to Kelli about my finances, and... 
 although I am... 
 doing great, making some strides, um, I'm not where I need to be right now. 
 What's that mean? 
 It's just... taking me a little bit longer to find my own place. 
 And... 
 you know I hate to ask, but is there any way I can stay with you a couple weeks longer? 
 'Cause, you know, I will reimburse you as soon as I get back on my feet. 
 Issa, honestly, me and Vanessa, you know, she's not really cool with you being around all the time. 
 Oh... 
 oh. 
 OK, um...
