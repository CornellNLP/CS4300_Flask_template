 Charlie! 
 You ain't met the real Sadie. 
 She ain't met the real Ralph Church. 
 [gasping] 
 Hey Ralph. 
 Like that home cooking? 
 Charmain Tully? 
 I'm Captain Perry with... 
 The red squad. 
 Are you trained for undercover work? 
 We've been trying to infiltrate the SDS,  Students for a Democratic Society. 
 There are other ways of making people hear you. 
 I'm Dennis. 
 You know Dennis Wilson? 
 You got some good music in you. 
 Hiya, Bunchy. 
 You gave birth to me as a Black Panther. 
 The Panthers want to raise consciousness in the community. 
 It needs raising. 
 It's "we" now, huh? 
 Welcome, sister. 
 I love you, Bri. 
 Everybody's doing the funny. 
 Tina Greenwood, reported missing right after Thanksgiving. 
 It's the same girl.

Be remembered simply as a good and decent man who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it. [gunshot] [background chatter] Ah, here it is. Do you mind taking that away? I'm sorry. Yes. It took you guys long enough to do anything at all. I reported her missising two months ago. Well, that was a different precinct. Um, when was the last time you saw her? Months. Church. Her father is my brother. He's ill. She stays home with him. She never went out? Didn't have any friends or a boyfriend maybe? No. Gail hasn't had a boyfriend since high school. She's so shy, you know. Blush if you look at her. This is all very helpful. Thank you. I tried, you know, to give her a push? I told her, you have to make yourself available. I even got her to put the ad in the paper. I'd just hate it if that was... Ad in the paper? Yeah. One of those Lonely Hearts. Didn't you get the letters? [Ronnie White's "Got To Give You Up" plays] ♪ When I try to kiss you ♪

Just... it's just we shouldn't rush this, you know? Let's take our time. Do it right. Your problem is is you're thinking a sane response is gonna stop an insane system. So you want to kill people? No one's gonna be in there at nighttime. You don't know that. What I know is that half of the chem professors at this university are on Uncle Sam's R&D payroll. Okay, so if someone stays late to work on a formula for bigger, better napalm, well, that's what he gets for his extra effort. Hey, listen, if this ain't your bag, you can take a walk. There's the metaphorical door. You can walk right through it. I'm in. All right, 'cause this happens tonight. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey. I need to find a shoebox. What? Our missing Gail?

Doctor said a little penicillin will clean it right up. They'll be fresh as virgins in a week. Yeah, but it's 1,500 bucks. All right? The dentist bills are coming in, too. It's like tens of thousands. I know, Jack. They're running the sickest game in town, ain't they? [phone rings] Hello. [playing guitar] Yeah. Sadie. Look, Charlie, I can't just... Take care of my girls? Who love you just right, huh? No, it's not that. They're great. You're all great. Yes, we are great, man. We give you truth. You need to be where it's at to do what you do, all right? We're what that is. [chuckles] Even if it's $100,000? Cost of authenticity, rock star. Well, then I guess we'd better get down to it and start recording something then, huh? Well... well, yeah. I mean, hell, yeah. Wait, who was that? Got yourself a gentleman caller? That was the doctor's office. I'm pregnant. Nothing in Records. Nothing in Reception. Nothing anywhere. Conway said he would put it on my desk. There is nothing on my desk. If this is some Allen Funt crap... Meg! Just came in. Maid came to work this morning to find her boss on the floor. So who wants this case? Two of us are investigating. One of us is investigating breakfast. You investigating dust bunnies, Hodiak? Looking for a shoebox. Probably next to a unicorn. Wait. This shoebox? It was sitting on my desk when I got in. Conway. Didn't know you wore a ladies' 4. So who's gonna take this? Fine. Uh, bup, bup, bup. Give that to Sam. He's spent enough time daydreaming about girls in ropes. [mutters] Shakespeare couldn't have written this one better. Dick's long, hard climb just became a quick ride down a greased slide. To acts of God and man. Always thought he was a fake. Who, Kennedy? That "for the people" horse hockey. A born-and-bred politician who doesn't lie and cheat? Ha. Please. Right. Right. Still, young guy in his prime, vibrant... There's a sadness. Softie. Better toughen up and think what appointment you want when Nixon takes office. He's leading by double digits. I'll get right on that. There's just one new hurdle. What's that? Johnson. He's a failure and an embarrassment. He's in secret cease-fire talks with Hanoi. Well, Saigon will still have to agree. Or be strong-armed to agree. We need to stop the talks. Right. Right.

I'm sorry, I don't know. No, no. Does anybody else work here? Just me and the cook, Joe. He's new. How new? She fired the last one about a week ago? You destroyed the bomb. Well, I drenched it and hoped that that would destroy it. Why the hell would you do that? Because people would die. Maybe so. And we can do something about that. We can imprison people. We could take considerable steps to put an end to SDS and other groups like it. Ask me what we can do about people sitting and talking. Look, I put you in to be eyes and ears, not charge in like Lancelot the bomb defuser. So next time, do us both a favor and sit on your hands. If you can, point them in the right direction. Now, one whole new chance to not screw up. I need you to take a drop from a CI with the black separatists. Can you do that? Or you gonna pour a Coke on their afros and defuse them, too? All I'm saying, if it's mine, I want to raise it. Be a dad, you know. We'll raise it together. That's what Charlie wants. If it's my kid, I should get some say how it grows up. Even if it's yours, the baby doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the family. [country music plays on radio] What the hell are we doing out here anyway? Quick pit stop. Handing off a bag. Drug deal? This is a drug deal? "Deal," hardly. Fella already paid for the stuff. I'm just the delivery man. How much is it? It's a lot. This fella, pretty fresh out of prison, trying to start up a new operation. My buddy had some extra supply he sold him. Giving me a little scratch to drop it off. So what do I do? You just sit there and be pretty. You're good at that. [chuckles] Feel bad for this guy. Had a hell of a time when he got out. Mind you, I don't know how much is truth or tale, but from what I hear, he was nearly killed, poisoned with soup. And his crew, his only friends, all dead.

I got a ranch worth of grass in my trunk and it ain't mine, so scrunch down and shut up. [tense music] Hey brother. Well, ain't you friendly. Let me see. Well, all right. Who's the little thing in there riding shotgun? Oh, she's just some chick I picked up... stray, you know. Let me see. I love a alley cat. Let's do this, Ralph. Come on. I'm just looking, man. Hey, girlie. [singsong] Hey! What's wrong with her? She's shy. Come on, I gotta get. [pounding] [gasps] This bitch. Oh, this bitch? Aah! Hey, hey! Get back here... Get off her! Get off me! Aah!

But it ain't all I'm saying. Yeah, I know. I get that. It's just... It's pop songs, Charlie. They want to be simple. Something they can sing along to, you know? Hell, this ain't no damn sing-along. I'm trying to give folks what they need, a juicy helping of uncut truth. Charlie! Charlie! We ain't changing the damn song... What? We messed up. Bad. We accidentally stole a fortune in drugs. Fortuitous timing. Rations were running low. What do you got? No, no, no, no, no. That's not what I'm... Take a breath there, little bird. Ralph Church is alive. [laughs] Live long enough, you see everything. This is not a joke. He wants to kill you. Hey, everybody calm down. He can't kill me. I can't die. Charlie, I love you, but I am serious. We need to take care of... You're serious? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Had a packed suitcase. Said he was going to visit Mom. I asked had he made those plans before or after he stabbed an old lady? How'd that work out for you? Yeah, well, hold on to your shorts. He says he's innocent. Get in there and close this damn thing. There you are. Come in here. Why don't you take this guy? I gotta go look at those letters. Whoa, whoa. You're dumping this on him? I'm delegating. It is about the younger generation. They're the future and lifeblood of the party, and... I don't know, I think it helps to see young faces at a political rally. Well, I couldn't pay my kids to come to a fundraiser. Death by boredom. Oh, I understand. Mine's the same. Uh, cream and sugar, Becky? No. When do we finally get to meet Emma? Semester must be done soon. Well, she's fallen in love with France. Can't say I blame her. I think she might extend her stay. Hi, Daddy. Everything okay? No, everything's fine. Ken's great. We're very involved in the campaign, and, well, I think it could be great for both of us. You're working on something for the campaign now? Yes, actually. Tea with the ladies. How are the ladies? Oh, just complaining about their figures and their kids. Oh, terribly exciting. Daddy, they keep asking about Emma. Well, you keep telling them she's traveling. I know, I just... I don't think I can keep it up much longer. Why not? Because she's in Los Angeles, she's... God knows what she's doing. We have to stick to the same story. I think... I think we need to do something. Shootout. Two officers hit. Three Panthers dead. Where? Gas station. Down near Panthers' headquarters. Kristin. Y-you gotta... Go, go, go. [tires screeching] 
 
 [background chatter] No, I don't know anything right now, sir. Kristin, Kristin... is she okay? I understand. Tell me! I know Kristin Shafe. I'm her husband. I'm the only white cop that comes in and out of here, okay? I can have a wagon down here in five minutes, get you all on obstruction. Sorry, I have to go. Baby! Hey, guys, that's my husband. You okay? What in the hell are you doing here? You cannot be here right now. To see if my wife is alive or dead? Yeah, I think I can stop by. I'm fine. Now please leave. Baby, you're not staying here. That's not your decision. Sweetheart, it's just not safe. Bernadette... You do not get to use that on me. Officer Shafe, you need to get out of here. You don't like that feeling? Wondering if I'm okay, if I'm coming home? Who's gonna watch after Bernadette? Well, neither do I. So now it's your turn. I will see you at the house. Police chop off your hair? Yeah, and Kristin took care of my balls. Excuse me. Hey, Wanda? I'm Perry's friend. Thank you. What you reading? I read that in college. Outside of class. Anything else, or... No. Yeah. Are you okay? This your first day? Two months. The SDS. Yeah, they ain't at where the Panthers at. But you'll see. Once the group goes violent, the boys do, too. If they haven't already. I know men. They're unconscious. They don't think. They're just chauvinists... They're what? Chauvinist pigs. Tell our friend I said hi, and maybe next time, send a grown-up. You have a great little day, miss. Yes, at Dennis Wilson's house. It's gated. Are you sure she's there? Grace! Grace? I won't be at dinner tonight. Late meeting. Okay. Who you talking to? It's my father. He's giving me campaign advice. "Be the prettier one" should cover it. Give him my regards. I'm sorry. It was Ken. He doesn't know yet. Well, you need to tell him. I'll tell him once we have Emma. What'd I miss? Besides your job? Bennie didn't do it. In fact, he wasn't even fired. He quit, after the old lady called him "spade" one too many times. So what's next? You want me to... No. I want you to stay. Stay... Sorry to make you wait, Miss Wallace. What happened with Bennie? Bennie didn't do it. We sent him home. Okay. You knew Miss Becker. You grew up with her. Mm-hmm. Can you tell me about her? She was generous... Mm. Always. Mm-hmm. Particular. Only one way to do anything. But so kind. We could use her around here, it sounds like. [laughs] I'll never forget this. She let me have my sweet sixteen at her house. Mm-hmm. I got to invite all my friends. They were in awe of the place. It was a palace. Made me feel like a queen the whole day. 'Course I still had to clean up afterwards. Ohh... I bet your mom is happy to see her, though. Up there? What do you think they're talking about? Think they're talking about you? I suppose. What do you think they're saying? Actually, they wouldn't be talking much. Miss Becker, she wasn't much of a talker. I'd like to go now, please. Well, Bennie told me different, actually. Bennie said she liked to talk a lot. Said her favorite word was "spade." She ever call you that? "Spade"? I don't know what you're talking about. What about "jungle bunny"? "Tar baby"? Stop it. Deirdre, what did she call you, "monkey"? 'Cause that's what you are. Look at you, just lying here right... I don't want to hate coloreds, but you're just lying to my face. You're not helping your cause at all. Now what did she say to you to make you want to... That's enough! Get out! What did she say to make you want to kill her? You can't even fool me. You think you're gonna fool God? All those things she called you, you are. That made you want to kill her. Damn it, get out. If IA gets wind of this... You cannot do this. What is wrong with you? I'm being dragged out of a case that I'm closing by an idiot! Closing? Are you kidding me? You are making a woman cry. Who is not your wife! I know. Yes. Do you? Patron saint of the underserved. Hodiak... She's not a victim! She's a murderer! Then prove it! Prove it! Don't lecture me on a job I've been doing since you couldn't wipe your ass. Are you hearing yourself? Are you hearing me? [sobbing] [sobbing] Stop, stop. [sobbing, muttering] I couldn't take it anymore! I couldn't take it anymore. Good job, Detective. [sobbing] I'm sorry. Let's just... sit down. I'm so sorry! Is that actual police work? I went through all the Lonely Hearts letters for phone numbers and addresses. Every one was a married man, wife and kids. Nothing worse than a public intox on any of them. We're a classy gender, aren't we? [chuckles] Except for one. Asked her to meet him at an address that was an auto body shop until it closed five years ago, empty storefront since. That's the rendezvous. The letter? No prints. Same for other letters from him. So it's a clue and a dead end. Oh, I got here just in time. Hey, I heard you questioned that maid so good she tried to give herself the death penalty. You know, sometimes I think I'm a bad person, and then you arrive. You're welcome. Now, I got three more cases with your name on them. And since these are, as you say, a dead end, you can get back to working on actual murder cases. It's not like it's a thankless job. White House Counsel. I'm sorry? My appointment. White House Counsel. That's what I want. You might have to work for it. Johnson bullied the South Vietnamese into a cease-fire deal. What are the terms? We don't know. Not great for Saigon, but good enough. For our honeymoon, Grace wanted to go to Paris. I didn't. Filthy city, no beach. So I told her that I had a secret honeymoon planned for us but she'd have to wait until after the wedding to find out. Where'd you go? We didn't have one. I had work, she had the kid. It all fell through. No Paris. We tell Saigon we'll offer them a better deal after the election. What you're suggesting is a violation of the Logan Act. Then when Nixon is elected, I, his Counsel, will advise him not to prosecute. [tense music] ♪ ♪ Sister. [gasps] You scared me. Where do you want to be shot? Now you're really scaring me. Everybody's got a spot. Most say forehead, cause it's quick. But it doesn't work all the time, and you end up a vegetable. Heart's a good possibility, but if the shooter misses, you drown in your own blood. If I had a choice... medulla oblongata. System shuts down. No pain, instant. Not too bad, considering. Brother Bunchy, I don't understand. Your husband was wrong for coming down here, but not about why. Everyone in the movement's ready to be killed. I understand the risks. You have to embrace it. Every day you leave your daughter to come here, that's the last time she sees your face. Just 'cause you picked a spot doesn't mean you won't get a shotgun to the nose. We're lucky to have you. But you gotta know what being here really means. Get home safe, sister. Now I ain't saying you went looking for this evil, but it found you. It chose you. So it's gotta be you to respond. Charlie. There's gotta be another way. I... This... This ain't me. This here is life. Obstacle and action. Go on. Pick it up. I don't want to. Damn it! You brought this evil from the past upon us. You will take care of it. Come on, you can do it. I know you can. Charlie, you gotta... What the hell? Come on in. Join the fun. What is this? It's a pep talk. See, the devil has delivered Ralph Church back to us. Right as we're on the cusp of recording, getting our message, our love, out into the world. But Tex is going to protect us. So what, you're gonna kill Ralph again? We're gonna do what needs to be done to protect our family, to protect the mission. We pointed guns at him, poisoned him, moved here. He still turns... up. Seems like we're more safe when he's in jail. Remember that cop friend of yours? The one that beat me till I was a bloody pulp at the foot of the Pearly Gates? You still able to get to him? Yeah. Yeah, I can. Hey. How you doing? I get it now. When you're the one in danger, you don't have time to be afraid. You were all I could think about today. Was it like that for you, when I was undercover? I don't know, Bri. [sighs] I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend all day, the rest of my life, in this house. But I don't want to risk... A babysitter. Miss Lopez? You mean the expensive one? Maybe she'd give us a discount if she was every day. Like a nanny. What are you saying? Maybe you go to school. And not just night classes, a full-time thing. Get a fancy degree. Write a bunch of books about... whatever it is you want. You don't gotta have your boots on the ground to change the world. You're laying out this perfect life, but you still can't tell me that you're using? What? I found it. The needle and the... No, no, that was for work. That was just for work. I just had to make it look like I did. Please, please don't. Baby, I can't tell you anything but the truth. I'm sorry I brought it in the house. You're gonna look me in the eye and tell me that that's the truth? Yes. Baby, come on. Honest, that is the truth. Okay? [tense music] ♪ ♪ Hey Adams? It's Sam Hodiak.

"It's only a matter of time before he slips up." What is this, a challenge? The guy's gonna stay in the woodwork unless we draw him out. No, no, no. The only thing this is gonna do is egg him on. You... Sorry. Hodiak, there's a broad to see you. Darn... Barn. No, it's not Barn, it's, um... Karn? Yeah, that sounds right. Because it is, Conway. What, did you put her in a shoebox? No, I put her in the break room. Thought you and Grace were, uh... doing your own thing. I'll fill you in later, Dear Abby. Detective Kodiak. For the record, not a "broad." I just wanted to tell you... show you... that my life's back on track now. We're not living in that house anymore. I'm staying with Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. He's helping me start a music career. So you, uh, you came back just to thank an old guy in a tie? Or you want to tell me why you're really here? Look, Dennis has been great for us. All Charlie does now is just play music. Every day, that's it. If your next word isn't "but," I'm gonna need another cup of coffee to keep me awake during this. But... There's this guy. From Charlie's past? He's been on our tail and I'm just afraid that... He's the one that taught Charlie to pimp. And I heard this guy say that he wanted to start back up again, with me. Hmm. What about your Beach Boy friend? He can't keep you safe? He'd get himself killed trying. He's not a fighter. He's a drummer. [chuckles] Well, unfortunately we can't lock up people for what they want to do, so unless he actually... He's on parole. And he attacked my friends yesterday. His name is Ralph Church.
