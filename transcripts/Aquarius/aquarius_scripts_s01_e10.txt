 Killer man. 
 I can see what you see. 
 There's the lost lamb. Save her! 
 Who is? Who? 
 Manson : You have killed, killer man, to save girls like her. 
 Many times, you've drowned the light of life. 
 Who do you kill, killer man? 
 War... world. 
 World War II? 
 Oh. 
 That was you, saving us? 
 You saved us, killer man, from the great Adolf Hitler?

 You know, um, Moran really saved your ass. 
 Yeah, that much I do know. He called you? 
 And the cab company and got the address where you were. 
 Moran somehow knew that you were high on something and for some reason figured I'd know how to handle it. 
 Yeah. Wild guess, huh? 
 Mm. 
 I told you that, uh, Emma and Rick were at the Spiral.

 Let me rephrase that. 
 I do care. I'll handle it.

 [knock at door] 
 Joe. 
 Hi, Sam. How you feeling? 
 Thank you for last night. 
 You really... you saved my ass. 
 Yeah, well, I want to cash that check right now, Sam. 
 That's a little quick, but okay. 
 Yeah, I saw this. 
 Salazar's got a hair up his ass about the Echo Park bus robberies. 
 Thinks the LAPD would be better off if there was more Chicano detectives. 
 I'm Cuban, Sam. 
 My real name is Jose Moran. 
 No. Don't bull... 
 Really? You're not Irish? You're Cuban? 
 Moran's a common Irish name, but it's also Spanish. 
 In junior high, I started calling myself Joe and when I moved out here, after serving in Korea, everyone assumed I was Irish. 
 Assumed or you led them on? 
 A little of both. 
 My people are fair-skinned. 
 My grandma had red hair and blue eyes. 
 So when I met my wife, Maggie, I let her think I was Irish. 
 Why? Did she say... 
 Her father hates Mexicans. 
 A lot of daughters like to defy their daddies. 
 Not Maggie. 
 When I met her, she was 18. 
 A very obedient, good little Catholic girl. 
 If her father objected... 
 I don't know. 
 You know, maybe we would've gotten married. 
 Maybe. 
 I love Maggie and my boys. 
 My beautiful red-headed, blue-eyed sons. 
 They're the world to me. 
 All these years, you've never told Maggie that you were Cuban? 
 I didn't have to. 
 My father died when I was six. 
 My mom passed when I was in Korea. 
 And the rest of my people are still in Cuba. 
 And Castro's making sure they don't show up. 
 And when I joined the department, of course it's better for me if nobody knows I'm Latino. 
 Let's be honest. 
 You really think I would've made detective if the brass knew I was a spic? 
 So I assume Salazar found out? 
 Yeah. 
 I can't for the life of me figure out how he knows. 
 Says I'm the only Latino detective in the department, which pisses him off. 
 But what really pisses him off is, what good is it if nobody knows? 
 Wants to interview me. 
 Says it'll give me power in the department to help Latinos. 
 I refused. 
 Salazar told me that, with or without my cooperation, his next column, a week from today, is gonna be about me. 
 He promised me that if I alert the brass first, he'll let me claim I did it voluntarily. 
 Says it'll look good for everybody to have a positive story about a Latino in the department. 
 Only problem about this positive story... it's gonna destroy my life.

 Okay, good. 
 So it's settled. 
 Eventually. 
 He'll need some time to break the news to his family slowly. 
 Slowly? 
 Yeah. 
 All Jose has to say is, "Honey, I'm Latino." 
 It takes two seconds. 
 Well, Ruben... 
 May I call you Ruben? 
 Of course. 
 And I... I see you were in Vietnam? 
 Covered it two years.

 Yeah. 
 Detective Hodiak, I have no sympathy for self-hating Joe Moran or his racist wife. 
 Ruben, if I've offended you in some way, I apologize, but don't punish Joe for my tactlessness. 
 I have given Detective Moran every chance to make the simple fact of his heritage less damaging, so his way or mine... in a week, everyone'll know that Joe is Jose. 
 Now, if you please...

 He's never used this method to bring in stuff before.

 Where's the stuff? 
 Now I know I can trust you. 
 Cutler : Go home, Sam. 
 Get some shut-eye. 
 You deserve it. 
 It was real good, what you did. 
 Thanks, Cut. 
 It was real good. [Patting] 
 How's Moran? 
 Four weeks mandatory observation. 
 Sam, the FBI did ask us to follow that antiwar kid. 
 Robbie Arthur. 
 Yeah. 
 Just got the surveillance photos. 
 Pretty boring stuff. 
 No contact with Walt. 
 Arrest this guy. 
 Who is he? 
 Just do me a favor. 
 Have a uni bring that lowlife in. 
 Sure.

 Dad. 
 Get these manacles off me.
