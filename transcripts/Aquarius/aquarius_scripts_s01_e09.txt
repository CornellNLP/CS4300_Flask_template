 What now? 
 Spics can't get justice 'cause there's no spics in the department. 
 Not true. Cleaning lady... 
 Ladies. Plural, please. 
 We got Portillo, Sanchez, that new meter maid, Corazon. 
 I think he means no senior officers. 
 It'd be good if there were a few. 
 Nice to have some brass I don't have to listen to. 
 You don't listen now. 
 Sorry, what? 
 Ha ha ha ha. 
 Spics should get promoted 'cause they're spics?

 Oh, yeah, this is what I call a real pickle. 
 Ahh. 
 What? 
 It's the orphanage Christmas party and I'm late, and you still owe 10 bucks for presents. 
 I was wondering where the Lieutenant is. 
 Your fairy godfather's at a racket in San Diego. 
 Sorry. Left me in charge, again. 
 None of that's yours, I hope. 
 No, I'm fine. 
 Look, there's no getting around it... I'm a witness. 
 Well, I'll go bust Lucille and that biker and call it a day. 
 I don't want Lucille. I want Guapo. 
 Then you didn't see anything. 
 Here we go again. 
 Yes, again, so why don't you predict what I'm gonna say so I don't have to say it, again. 
 Something like Jimmy was a low-life criminal, didn't pay his taxes, had it coming. 
 Something like that? 
 Cutler : That's what actual policemen call "misdemeanor homicide." 
 Jimmy was your route to Guapo. Jimmy is now dead. 
 Lucille is now your route. 
 But she can't be your route if you arrest her. 
 Cutler : Plus no body. 
 How much does the D.A. love that? 
 We all love that. 
 Cutler : Listen, it's your call, Junior. 
 Sammy here can go make two murder arrests that'll never stick, and blow your cover. 
 Or, we just call this one last name on my naughty list. 
 No. 
 Mike? 
 Man, I'm done. 
 Look, I get it. 
 No, you don't, man. 
 Okay? 
 Look at you, you've got a job. You have got a life. 
 You are in charge of you. 
 First of all, I'm a cop, so, no, and second of all, I'm married, so really no. 
 You're married? 
 Yeah. 
 Did I know that? 
 I hope not. 
 Otherwise, I'd be pretty bad at all this. 
 You have kids? 
 One. 
 [laughs] 
 I want to have kids. 
 Someday. 
 Well, first, you gotta get to "someday." 
 So you're gonna go back in there, you're gonna stay close to Lucille, and you're gonna... give her anything she wants. 
 You don't know what you're asking. 
 None. 
 In the bedroom, it's like being mauled. 
 Oh, I am weeping for you. 
 You want me to show you what she did to me last night? 
 No, no. 
 This is after she wasted the guy, man, because the blood, it just riled her up, man. 
 Stop. I believe you. 
 I believe you, okay? 
 She's out of her mind, sick. 
 Look at this. 
 Mike, okay? But she likes you. 
 And she trusts you and right now, you got her in heat. 
 Mike, my job is to get that woman to trust me. 
 Which she only half does. 
 Your job is to ball her until she can't see straight. 
 I really think you're the one coming out on top. 
 [moans] 
 All the lines come... 
  Charlie? 
 You give me a moment. 
 I was just there, Charlie. 
 Where's that, Kenny-Ken? 
 You know. 
 I see. 
 I see. How is she? 
 Not she, not anymore. 
 It. 
 That makes it easier for you, then, sure... 
 "It" she is. 
 I should have done this a long... 
 It's gone, all of it.

 Take them all there. 
 It's just rocks again. 
 Now there's nothing you can do to me. 
 And Emma? Her being gone... 
 Was that you? 
 She's not here? 
 Took off wearing that same pretty dress she came in. 
 Oh, man. 
 I figured you silver-tongued her back to the debutante ball. 
 Oh, God. She wanted to be free, I... 
 Man, who's free? 
 Not her. Not you. 
 Not anybody! 
 Everybody in the world is living in a prison they built. 
 They're the wardens, inmates. The razor wire, the chains.

 I don't know what to do sometimes. 
 Whatever it... I just... 
 Man, why are you here? 
 To see her? 
 I'm... I'm tired. 
 You're here for love. 
 Her, me. And that's all right. 
 I only ever wanted you to know that I love you. 
 I love you.

 I said stop. 
 I love all of you.

 Hi. My name is Sam Hodiak. I'm a friend of Martha's. 
 She said I might be calling. 
 Yeah. Uh... oh... no. 
 No, I'm not looking for a good time, but you sound... amazing. 
 I just... what I'm looking for is, uh, an old roommate of yours, an old friend of Martha's, Louise Mitchell? 
 No? Nothing? 
 Oh. Well, that's too bad. 
 Well, eh... what? 
 She had a son? 
 Gregory? Huh. 
 Well, how old might Gregory be right now? 
 Wow, okay, uh... thank you. 
 No, I think all my good times are covered, but if something should come up, you will be the first to know, Kandi. 
 Randi. Mandi. Okay. Thank you.

 Ah, but you get to know him... he's worse.

 The Polack could talk less and bathe more. 
 Fair point. 
 You know Lou's letting me do a ride-along? 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Down in Watts. Your old beat, right? 
 Yeah. That's a little far south for us. 
 Lotta action, I hear. 
 That there is. What are we doing down there? 
 They're light on patrol, so they're pulling from other divisions. 
 Not everybody an action fan I guess, huh?

 Charmain give you that? 
 The blue part and that it sideswiped a red Studebaker. 
 The late model Buick two-door Moran got off the cook that was out back. 
 And leaky oil pan, off the scene. 
 Hodiak : The bloody boot print is a common crepe bottom work boot. 
 The weapon is a Colt 1911 .45. 
 And you buy her description? That the shooter's white? 
 In that neighborhood? Hysterical female... 
 I don't think anyone's buying that. 
 How long were Markham and Sabovich on loan down there? 
 This was their... second day. 
 All right, where were they before that, exactly? 
 Southwest. 
 Right, so that's... That's roughly... 
 Moran : Yeah. 
 Hodiak : All right. 
 Deputy Commissioner's got SWAT on standby. 
 Oh, that's great. Neighborhood wired like a bomb, add a battalion of white cops in helmets and high-powered rifles... what could possibly go wrong? 
 Sam, what if Charmain's wrong? What if the shooter is a spade? 
 You wanna go pull him out of Watts alone? 
 Shafe : 'Scuse me, 'scuse me. 
 I got him. 
 You got who? 
 I caught him at home, just him and his bodyguard. 
 He come willingly? 
 Once I pulled my gun, disarmed 'em both and cuffed him. 
 Anybody else down there see you pick him up? 
 No. Pretty clean. I hustled him through the back, so... he's all ours, and it's our eyes only. 
 You okay with this? 
 Markham and I were in the Academy. 
 Our wives are friends. 
 He's got three-year-old twins. 
 Today I'm okay with whatever gets it done.

 Call my lawyer... explain your form of help to him. 
 Special weapons and tactical... SWAT. 
 The LAPD's duly licensed assassins? 
 I'm all too familiar. 
 No, not as familiar as you're gonna be. Two dead cops on that block... that's curfews, that's checkpoints. 
 Sniper nests, door-to-door presence. 
 A war's coming? 
 Well... that's why we're an army. 
 And it's the worst kinda war 'cause it's stupid, and it'll never end. 
 It's the only kind white America knows how to fight. 
 Hey, just stop talking to me like you're passing out your pamphlets. 
 The LAPD is searching for a colored shooter that's gonna leave your world turned inside out, upside down, and pretty much locked down forever because they won't find him. 
 You're not showing your usual faith in law enforcement. 
 No. Because the shooter is white. 
 Your bosses think that? 
 Our bosses are highly doubtful. 
 But I think we're looking for a male, 6'2 " to 6'4", 20s to 50s, driving a blue Riviera sedan with a red scratch on the passenger side and a pretty bad oil leak. 
 And he is very, very white. 
 Shafe : You wanna keep SWAT out of your daily life, show us you're an army. 
 Who hurt you? 
 You should know. 
 It was your idea. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 I guess we got karma, him and me. 
 I need to get settled into the here and now. 
 You can't... do anything to him. 
 You're right. 
 Our karmic business is for me to forgive him. 
 To teach him forgiveness. 
 Or let him take his own path, however... destructive that may be for him. 
 Charlie... 
 You've shown me, Ken. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, Ken.

 Which he failed to report to the police. 
 Well, the witness in Watts who gave you the partial plates can't positively I.D. Mr. Lesick as the driver. 
 This isn't the weapon that was used in any of the shootings. 
 You don't have his boots, gloves, clothes. 
 He tested negative for gunpowder in the paraffin. 
 What about the Nazi reading list? 
 Found only in his trash. 
 He claims it isn't his. 
 And there seems to be some question about whether your initial search was wholly legal. 
 Maybe somebody didn't wait for the, uh, warrant to be issued? 
 So, what, we should have just left the scene so the old lady could burn it while we went to a judge? 
 The guy pulled a gun on me. 
 He and his wife both claim that you were already drawing your weapon before you identified yourself as a police officer.

 Describe him. 
 Describe him. 
 White male. Fair. Mid-30s. 
 Facial hair, 6'3", 220. 
 Which is exactly what I wrote down on my notebook when you described the shooter to me at the scene. 
 No, I told you... 
 Yes, you did! 
 I can't lie. 
 Yes, you can and yes, you will or two people are gonna walk out of this building today... you and him. The difference being that one day, a lot of dead cops later, he's gonna be back. 
 You want me to testify under oath... 
 Look around. 
 Damn it, look around! 
 Four of us are dead. 
 No one here would do any different. 
 But if he did it, if he was guilty... 
 This isn't a fairy tale, Charmain. 
 Decide now. 
 You gonna stop trying to be one of us, or are you gonna be one of us? 
 I am. 
 You are? 
 I am. 
 You are what? 
 One of you. 
 Yeah? 
 Prove it. 
 Charmain. 
 She's not quite as good as you. 
 Well, she's young. 
 She's doing the best she can. 
 She's gonna be a good cop someday. 
 I hope. 
 I don't know about that. 
 I meant she's almost as good a liar as you. 
 I'm not a liar. 
 And how would I know that? 
 Hopefully never. 
 Lesick will be arraigned for the murder of four officers tomorrow morning. 
 I take it you'll be there? 
 Every day till he's tied and fried and if you need someone to pull the switch, I'll hold an auction. 
 Couldn't have done it without your guy tagging that partial at the second scene. 
 Do us both a favor... 
 Keep it to yourself. 
 Well, if you will, I will. 
 Oh, and Bunchy, merry Christmas. 
 Blow it out your ass, Hodiak. 
 Oh! All right. 
 All right. 
 Think I made a new friend.

 Nope. Unless you have something to say, which would be... understandable.
