 Banyin : [sighs] 
 Rough night? 
 [chuckles] Rough morning, and it's barely 10:00. 
 Somehow I managed not to break out the vodka yet, though. 
 Pretend we're at brunch. Tomato juice and hollandaise and who's got the lowest handicap. 
 I was on the phone with Middendorf. 
 Oh? What'd he have to say? 
 Banyin : We were talking about the direct-mail program. 
 Oh, yes, hi. It's me. 
 What'd he have to say about the direct-mail? 
 Well, you were right to keep it going. 
 It's raising enough by itself now to cover operating costs for the national committee. 
 That's fantastic. 
 Isn't it? 
 Yes. Yes, it is. 
 That's why it's you. 
 What is? 
 California campaign finance chair... for Nixon. 
 It's you, pal. [Laughs] 
 My God, I don't even know what to... 
 Yes, you say yes. And I say congratulations. 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 So why was it rough this morning then? 
 'Cause I wanted it to be me. And... 
 'Cause of what's coming next. 
 They're gonna need to look into us. 
 Nixon's people. 
 They're gonna go deep. 
 Into both of us. 
 Into the firm, the whole damn thing, but... once you told me Manson was out, I... I took some steps. 
 Padded the paychecks of a couple slobs at Missing Persons to call me in case anyone asked about that poor girl's file. 
 This morning, someone did. 
 But not just any someone. 
 20 years old, long blonde hair, no tattoos, no birthmarks, Smallpox vax on her hip. 
 My wife's got one of those. 
 Try not to lose the plot just yet, Dunphy. 
 Last seen December '59 in a red sequined a-line dress and red pumps. 
 Terrific. You talk to youth squad? 
 Youth squad, runaway unit, vice, jail, morgue... 
 Nothing, nowhere, no, no, no, no. 
 We got a picture? 
 We do not, lost to the ages. 
 Dunphy : We got prints? 
 Vice does have prints. 
 Fine, give me my marching orders. 
 Calling all PDs. Check and see if they got a Jane Doe body dump matches her description. 
 Start with LA County, then go to Ventura and Orange. 
 Done. We know her name? 
 Caroline, Caroline Beecher. 
 So why we working so hard to find a hooker's been missing for seven years? 
 Because a guy named Ken Karn and his friends don't want us to.

 The baby keeps moving around, kicking Mary from the inside.

 A baby, Charlie's baby. 
 Were you? 
 I'm surprised it took so long, is all. 
 It'll be beautiful. 
 You'll see. 
 How do you know? 
 'Cause I got one. Just turned five. 
 First found out about him, it was a bit of a hang up, I'm not gonna lie. 
 Now? It's all love, man. 
 Charlie said it would be, and it is. You'll see. 
 [car horn honking] 
 Who's this guy? 
 [horse shoes dropping]

 Where you going, Mr. Police Officer? 
 Oh, no, no. 
 I'm Elliot Hillman. I produce music for Ham Chapel, the record company. 
 I was told, uh, the writer lived here. 
 I'm just trying to find Charles Manson. 
 Well, welcome. 
 [police siren blaring] 
 Sam? 
 Hi. 
 Thought we might do better on neutral ground. 
 I been trying not to think about how well I didn't behave last time I saw you. 
 I said some incredibly stupid things. 
 I forgive you. 
 In fact, I forgive you in advance for anything you might ever say or do again, ever. 
 Grace : You said Manson was a pimp, and that one of his girls... 
 Disappeared, yeah. 
 But he didn't go to prison for that. 
 Why not? 
 It's too hard to make a case without a body, especially 'cause he had a good lawyer. 
 Ken's not good, he's great. 
 Well, that begs the question, what's a first-rate lawyer doing representing a third-rate pimp? 
 There's no good answer to that, is there? 
 None I can think of.

 Okay, how am I supposed to go back to diner coffee after this, huh? 
 I learned from my dad. 
 If there was one thing he knew, it was coffee. 
 Might've been the only thing. 
 Well, he must've known some things. 
 I mean, he was the big boss. 
 [scoffs] Before he died, he whacked, burned, or plowed the wife of every friend he ever had. 
 Left me on my own to claw my way back up. 
 Made it so now I have to share with dizzy trim like Lucille. 
 If I wanted a partner, it wouldn't have been a woman. 
 If I wanted it to be a woman, it sure as hell wouldn't have been her. 
 Bikers, they could help you with that. 
 [chuckles] 
 Satans could. 
 As in that Roy guy? [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, you're funny. 
 They've got no history with your dad, good or bad. 
 They like money, they know drugs, and I'm pretty sure they never sleep. 
 Be like having your own army. 
 You wouldn't have to share with anybody. 
 So Butano and Kovic are in business together. 
 What happens when they start to wonder what's in it for you? 
 Don't you have work to do? 
 Yeah, actually, I do. 
 I'm looking for Manson's disappeared hooker. 
 Officially? How's the brass feel about that? 
 Don't you have work to do?

 Hey. 
 Lucille Gladner, man. 
 Lucille? She wants to see me. 
 So? 
 So? So. So maybe she wants to see me, or maybe she wants me to think that she wants to see me, so that I make it easy for her, man. 
 I just... I walk in and I show up to my own damn funeral. 
 Why would Lucille want to kill you? 
 [scoffs] I don't know. 
 Maybe 'cause I talk to cops? 
 Okay, and how is blowing town gonna make you less suspicious to Lucille? 
 Call her. Call her. 
 Call Lucille, tell her you're gonna go see her, and then go see her, okay? Trust me. 
 Don't trust yourself. You're not reliable. 
 Doesn't feel like a good idea. 
 [tuning guitar] 
 Hillman : So where'd you learn to play? 
 Oh. McNeil, yeah.

 Well, as long as you're not here to talk about the state of my eternal soul...

 Have a seat. 
 Oh, I'm sure your mother would like me to discuss your soul with you, but... 
 Yes, I'm sure she would. 
 Yes, she would, but no. 
 Okay. 
 I just... 
 I want your opinion on something. 
 I'm concerned about Father Rowe, our pastor. 
 I think you've met him. 
 I have. 
 I've had dinner with him a few times, over at my mother's house. He can sure put away the Parker House rolls, that guy. 
 Hmm. 
 What's your concern? 
 On Mondays, I count the parishioner donations. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 About $2,000 is the usual. 
 Okay. 
 But since the spring, Father Rowe has asked me to set aside 500 each time for him. 
 500 for what? 
 I don't know. He didn't say, and I wouldn't ask. 
 Uh... well, here. 
 Here. 
 Okay? Can you see? 
 Well, not as well as I used to. 
 [chuckles] Me neither. 
 Here and here. 
  Mm-hmm. 
 He's written out the check to cash, and not mentioned it to me. 
 Right. 
 Do you think I'm overreacting to this? 
 Unfortunately, no, I don't think you are, actually. 
 Oh. 
 What do I do now? 
 Well, you know what, I'll give it to someone, someone the pastor doesn't know, someone he won't recognize. 
 Yes, but... but when they report, they'll give the information back to you first? 
 They'll talk to me, I'll tell you, and we'll figure it out, okay? 
 All right? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Thanks, Sammy.

 Nope.

 Anybody know a Wanda Hartley? 
 Here I come to save the day. 
 Detective Squad. What? 
 This one she one's from eight years ago. 
 How long has this girl been missing? 
 What? 
 Well, here's another girl arrested in the same wagon as Caroline. 
 Louise Mitchell. Black hair, brown eyes, gives her address as 2800 Fountain. 
 Tattoo of a butterfly on her shoulder. 
 Also known as Laney Watson and Lois Miller. 
 Does that mean something to you? 
 She's the one who reported my girl missing. 
 Who wants to go for a ride in the car? 
 Just over to St. Finian's. 
 Don't make me go alone. 
 What's over at St. Finian's? 
 Priest strangled in the vestry, if you can believe it. 
 What's the world coming to? 
 Father Mic... Mac... Some harp name. Maybe a robbery. 
 They didn't say if anything was missing. 
 You're calling someone a harp, Dunphy? 
 I'll go. We can stop for chili dogs. 
 It's right on the way. 
 Hey. 
 You doing all right there? 
 I'm tired. 
 And I know who did it. 
 You ready? 
 Bring him out, get his reaction when he sees the body. 
 Where did they find him? 
 Stairs of the parish house. Said he'd been asleep, blinking like a babe in the woods. 
 Very convincing. Almost had to ask for absolution for waking them up. 
 Father, there you are. 
 Are you sure you're prepared for this now, very... disturbing site. 
 Two? 
 What? 
 You should have brought more cops. 
 No, Sam. Sam! 
 After this we'll head over to the Blue Room. 
 There's a delivery coming, all right? 
 I want them just to jump right on it. 
 Get things going, but I want you there for my eyes and ears. 
 Hey, sorry to interrupt, but the package is here. 
 Here? Why is it here? 
 I don't know, someone got confused? 
 I said not to leave it, but he said you said to. 
 He said I... 
 Unbelievable. Where is he? 
 Guest performer dressing room. 
 All right. 
 Come on, let's just get it, put it in your car, take it over to the Satans right now. 
 Hey, hang on a second, man.

 Hodiak : Please, tell me about your first day of work at the hospital. 
 For the love of God, why? 
 I kind of need to hear a good story today right now. 
 How are you so sure it is one? 
 You know it is and you know why. 
 You got your job, and you got your uniform, and put on your hat, you got to the hospital and you said, "Good morning." 
 And then... 
 Martha : Well, there wasn't all the disposable equipment back then so... 
  Mm-hmm. 
 The nurses had to sterilize the syringes and the needles and the tubes. 
 You know, soak and scrub them, put them in the autoclave to kill the germs. 
 Yeah. 
 And after eight hours my legs were tired, so... 
 Mm-hmm. 
  I decided to sit on the desk while I did my work. 
 And this head of department walks by and sees me sitting there and I thought I was fired. 
 He looks at me and he says, "Smart thinking, nurse." 
 It was glorious. 
 [knocking at door] 
 Did I imagine that or did that happen? 
 That happened. 
 All right. 
 Could be booze delivery. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 I left a message with your service. 
 Maybe more than one. 
 I haven't picked up any. 
 Oh, um, that's fine. 
 I just... I didn't feel right coming by the station again. 
 You know, with everything that goes on there. 
 Especially since what I'm asking isn't official police business anyway. 
 You know, I wouldn't want to get you into any trouble, or... 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, don't be. 
 Well, if you find out anything... 
 I'll let you know soon as I do. 
 And thank you for your patience. 
 Thank you for yours. 
 I'll give her a second and then I'll go out the service entrance, in case she's still out front. 
 Just tell me where it is. 
 I'm sorry. 
 People need to stop apologizing so much. 
 Hey, did you ever know a Louise Mitchell? 
 Yeah, I used to run with Louise. 
 We weren't very close but I liked her a lot. 
 At least until she skipped town anyway. 
 Why?
