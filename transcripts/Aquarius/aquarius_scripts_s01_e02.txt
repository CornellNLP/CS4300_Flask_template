 [Faucet turns off] 
 I don't understand how... 
 How? A knife, how. 
 And you fought him? Why? 
 I'm not gonna let some little spic get my... my... my watch, my wallet... 
 How'd you fight him off? 
 The briefcase. 
 What? 
 Just thought there might be scratch marks from the struggle. 
 What happened to your pants? 
 Is there a reason you're here, Detective? 
 He knows who Emma's with. 
 All right. 
 Just tell me where. I'll go pick her up. 
 Name Charles Manson ring a bell? 
 No. 
 You sure? 
 Well, that's... 
 I knew him years ago, but what does this have to do... 
 Emma's with him. 
 What? Why? 
 He's your client. 
 Ex-client. 
 Has he contacted you? 
 Grace, what the hell is this? 
 Just tell us everything. 
 Us? 
 You can go, Detective. 
 I have the commissioner's home number on my desk, right next to the mayor's. 
 We can sure do this. 
 Ken's secretary, you like her? 
 No. 
 She a little afraid of you? 
 More than a little, I hope. 
 Why? 
 Ask her for a favor. 
 And don't tell Ken. 
 [Acoustic guitar playing] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 I was just in the kitchen, Charlie. 
 Um... 
 Did you know there's nothing to eat? 
 Like, not a crumb. 
 Come here, little thing. 
 Sit. 
 I know your hunger's real. 
 So's mine. 
 So's everybody's. 
 But you know what's bigger than that? 
 Your power. 
 Look. 
 Sadie and Katie are using their power to work on the dream. 
 You know what the dream is, right? 
 Of course. 
 Your music. 
 So tell me, what are you doing for the dream? 
 I... haven't thought of anything. 
 Come look. 
 Can you see me on the cover of one of these? 
 Dressed like this? 
 I'm gonna meet record producers, the best in the biz. 
 And are they gonna look at Charlie and go, "bigger than the Beatles"? 
 You don't even know how important you are to all this. 
 But you're gonna figure it out. 
 When was the last time Manson checked in? 
 Oh, about a month. 
 I need you to be just a little bit more specific. 
 Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Hold on. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I wanted to pick up where we left off with Gladner. 
 It's bad vibes, man. 
 People saying you're the fuzz. 
 Now, why would anyone think that? 
 Streets got their own thing, my man. 
 There's... 
 [Grunts] Crazy whispers in the concrete. 
 ♪ Crazy whispers in the concrete ♪ 
 [Coughs] 
 Hey, do you think that that would be a good song title? 
 I'm coming over. 
 Wait, what? 
 And if I have to look for you, I'm gonna teach you a whole new song about concrete. 
 Shafe. 
 You were supposed to get me an update yesterday. 
 Yeah, sorry, I got distracted with that, uh, off-the-books thing we're doing. 
 Yeah, well, you want to play the big top, you got to learn to juggle. 
 Hey, sorry, got it, uh... 
 Well, supposed to be October 11th but failed to check in. 
 Half case of I.W. Harper's coming your way, but I need a current address. 
 Why don't you check with known associates, and how about that Beverly Hills lawyer of his, Ken Karn? 
 You got it. 
 Bottoms up, you Irish b*st*rd. 
 This a bad time for a favor? 
 Depends. You offering or asking? 
 My snitch, Vickery... 
 Guitar man. 
 That's right... uh, well, turns out he's been blabbing about my secret identity. 
 So you get the play, right? 
 It only works if you're you. 
 But on purpose, like 1,000-yard stare, psycho-cop scary. 
 You want to see scary, keep your foot right where it is.

 Victim is white female.

 Husband found her, called it in. 
 We got here and found her around 9:00 am Joyce Nankin, 62. 
 Appears to be blunt force to the head. 
 Where were you before you came home, Mr. Nankin? 
 The studio. 
 Oh, you're an artist? 
 Dance instructor. 
 Oh. 
 So you were teaching at the... 
 No. No. 
 It's closed. 
 Wednesdays in general or... 
 Closed. Completely. 
 So what were you doing there? 
 Cleaning up, packing. 
 Alone? 
 Yes. 
 [Clears throat] Mr. Nankin, have you... 
 Have you had any trouble in the neighborhood? 
 No problems. 
 Except we woke up one day in Africa, with their music and their sounds and their stink. 
 Lovely, all of it, 'cause business is booming. 
 I mean, who wouldn't want to drive down here to... 
 To Darkest Monkey-Ville and learn how to do the box step? 
 And you people, you were so, so good when my car was broken into and when I got mugged. 
 You almost got down here the day that we called you. 
 And we thank you. 
 My wife... 
 And I. 
 We thank you. 
 We got no bread. 
 You know what I need. 
 Make it happen. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is your moment. 
 You dive into your own beautiful future or fall right back into mommy and daddy. 
 [Car door opens] 
 He's crazier than ever. 
 [Car door closes] 
 What else did he say? 
 Besides the fact that he has my daughter? 
 You never should have gone to a cop, Ken. 
 Grace was out of her... 
 This cop and Grace, that's the problem, Ken. 
 Charlie we can deal with. 
 Charlie's an ant. 
 All right, he wants to meet somebody in the music business? 
 Whatever. You make it happen. 
 He has to give my girl back. 
 All right, first you make Charlie happy, then you get this cop to step off. 
 Look at me. 
 I'm not the only one Manson can hurt. 
 We can't afford this, Kenny. 
 Not right now. 
 [Sighs] 
 How does this afternoon look? 
 This afternoon? 
 The fundraiser. 
 Oh, my god. 
 Get it together, Kenny. 
 This is a ball we do not drop. [Knocking] 
 Mr. Karn, I know you said no interruptions, but there's an urgent call from Mr. Bruce Tamminy from the San Pedro parole office. 
 He says it's regarding your client Charles Manson. 
 Yeah, put him through, Sheryl. I'll take care of it. 
 Bruce. [Chuckles] 
 Mr. Karn. 
 Yeah, no, Ken's out of the office right now, Bruce, but, uh, I wanted to make sure I spoke to you immediately about your Mr. Manson.

 Hey. 
 What did I tell you? 
 Told you to stay away from the front of the store. 
 Get out. Get out into the street. 
 Thank you. 
 Shut your mouth. 
 Come on. 
 You're going to jail. 
 What I told you. 
 Move on.

 Oh, no, no, no, no. Stop, no cops, come on. 
 Ow! Stop it! 
 Stop.

 You're hurting me. 
 Aw, baby-jam.

 Hodiak. 
 Marched across the Potomac and amassed at the Pentagon, resulting in a full-scale riot. 
 I had Charmain check. 
 The Nankins have been the victims of crime zero times. 
 So that lie was incredibly stupid. 
 Most murders, you're not exactly dealing with Goldfinger. 
 ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ 
 Very sorry, Leo. 
 My aunt had the exact same thing. 
 The pills just killed her appetite. 
 Except for one thing. 
 Vanilla milkshake. 
 How are you today? 
 You mind if I ask you a few questions? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Nothing too heavy. Just a few. 
 She was a real looker, your missus. 
 MGM dancer in the '30s? Big deal back in the day. 
 I think I saw her with Fred Astaire. 
 You in the movies too, Leo? 
 No. No, I didn't get that far. 
 Why not? 
 Just not good enough. 
 Ah, not good enough. 
 Bet you heard that a few times, huh, Leo? 
 You sure you're a cop? 
 Oh. I just need a trim. 
 Or you're a narc. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Anyway, uh, between 7:15 and 8:15, Mr. Nankin's car was in the driveway. 
 And you saw him, 7:30, 7:45 right out front? 
 He was on his porch, smoking. 
 Did you say good morning? 
 He never so much looked me in the eye, me or my family. 
 And that wife of his, god rest, but... 
 She didn't have a Christian bone in her body. 
 Afternoon, Ms. Lee. 
 May we speak with you? 
 Uh, in a second, guys. We're just in the middle of... 
 We know what you're doing, Officer, and it's now over. 
 Go inside, baby. 
 We're investigating a murder here. 
 Ma'am... 
 Excuse me. 
 Couldn't have been easy for a woman like that to age, married to a younger guy. 
 Thing is, Leo, you never called the cops. 
 The only calls to the police involving you and your wife were from your neighbors... 
 (Stammering) No... 
 About you and your wife. 
 Fighting. 
 I took a look at the report. 
 The names she called you. 
 Talentless. 
 Leech. 
 Pansy. 
 Then you get sick. 
 I can't imagine that turned her into Florence Nightingale all of a sudden. 
 Leo, I'm married. I get it. 
 Any man would. 
 Then with the pills, you're just not yourself. 
 How's that milkshake? 
 This neighborhood has grieved over 27 murders this year. 
 All black. 
 How many of those were solved, Officer? 
 Not enough. 
 Not one. 
 You are an occupying force. 
 Until you withdraw, we will not help you. 
 All right. 
 Nation of what? 
 Islam. 
 For Pete's sake. 
 Look, we got a lying-ass, doped-up, dying dancer in a wig. 
 No physical evidence and now no witnesses. 
 I'm not seeing a quick close to this, and we're seriously late for my snitch. 
 Mm. 
 How about the guy without the hat? 
 You got a name on him? 
 Bunchy Carter. 
 All right, follow my lead. 
 Leo, we're about to make an arrest in your wife's murder. 
 I'm sorry about everything. 
 I really am. 
 Hiya, Bunchy. 
 It's Mr. Carter. 
 Mm. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Get out of my face. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Come on, you know the moves. 
 Get out of my face. 
 Hey, stand down. Stand down. 
 [Onlookers shouting] 
 Everyone stand down and bear witness. 
 Come on, you know the moves. 
 It's Hodiak, right? 
 Oh, yes, it's nice to be remembered. 
 Is there an actual charge? 
 Actually, yeah, there is, Mr. Carter. 
 Come on, man! What y'all doing? 
 Let him go! 
 Come on, man, why would I rat you out? 
 Who'd you tell? 
 No one. 
 Who'd you tell I'm a cop? 
 No one!

 Anything you say can be used against you in court. 
 You have the right to talk to a lawyer. 
 Bunchy, your deep understandable hatred of the Nankins has helped put mister, sadly, where he belongs. 
 So... thank you? 
 No. Thank you. 
 You're either asking me to join the Nation of Islam or telling me to dress better. 
 One of the Nation's objectives is for all negroes to leave the united slave states and repopulate our native Africa. 
 But when you imprison me without reason... 
 Without reason? 
 To achieve your objective despite the suffering you inflicted on me... 
 You were interfering with a police investigation. 
 I see now that my true path lies not in flight from this country... 
 Oh, Bunchy, I've known you since you were 11 years old. 
 My true path lies in changing this country because I'm not a pacifist. 
 No, you're a crook in a new costume. 
 You are a living lie. 
 I am the truth who will burn your world to the ground. 
 Does this mean I really get to keep the tie? 
 Watch your back, Hodiak.

 Closing a case? 
 Is that what you call that? 
 The guy did it! 
 The guy had rights! 
 Not today. 
 Back up. 
 What?

 You think all you did was lean on a perp? 
 When you haul in an innocent man... 
 Bunchy?

 Child, he didn't know that. 
 He's just a dumb spade to you, right? 
 Oh... 
 Yeah, doesn't know nothing about nothing. 
 Grow up. 
 Easiest target in the world. 
 I was shaking him loose. 
 You hold him overnight. 
 You dump a crime spree on him he had nothing to do with. 
 Would you pull any of that if he were white? 
 Would I pound the fear of god into some mope I needed to bend if he was white? 
 Yes. 
 I did, for you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 If you think those things are the same, maybe we can't do this, you and me. 
 And you helped me out, and I want to help you find that girl, but I will not do the job the way you do. 
 You don't even know what the job is. 
 You know what? 
 Give me a ride home. 
 Excuse me? 
 We get through this or past it. 
 You know, like, literally half the time, I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 [Car pulling in] 
 Hey, Howard. 
 I'm good. You? 
 Huh? 
 Come on. 
 She did? 
 Seriously? 
 Well, the ladies, huh? What are you gonna do? 
 Him I like. 
 And the baby does this. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, honey. 
 Have a nice chat with Howard? 
 Always. 
 Hi. 
 You're home early. 
 Mwah. 
 Yeah, this is Hodiak. 
 We work together. 
 Sam. 
 Kristin. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 And then who is this? 
 Bernadette. 
 Bernadette? My favorite Saint. 
 Well, I'm not too sure that's her career path. 
 Mm-mm. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Bernadette cooing] 
 Yes. 
 Subtle. [Door closes] 
 Don't lead a subtle life. Thought you ought to know. 
 I don't, unless we're gonna keep on looking for Emma. 
 Then I guess you do. 
 [Car door opens] 
 So, Sam, this thing with Walt. 
 I talked to my brother-in-law at Pendleton. 
 The thing I don't get is how he just got out. 
 I mean, my brother-in-law said, "the only way you ever get sent stateside is if one of your parents is dying." 
 And, I mean, it takes letters and doctors and all... 
 [Exhales] 
 Opal. 
 Officer. 
 You sent the letter, didn't you? 
 To get him back. 
 Said you were what? 
 Sick? Dying? 
 Which one of your barfly friends did you get to play the doctor? 
 [Glass shatters] 
 Our son is AWOL from a combat zone. 
 He's a deserter. He could go to prison. 
 You too. 
 You're in a real pickle there, Officer. 
 You gonna turn me in? 
 No. You're gonna do what's right. 
 You're gonna turn him in. 
 I won't have to. 
 They'll come for him. 
 You have no idea what you've done. 
 Walt? 
 So his secretary said Ken had gotten nine phone calls from Manson. 
 She said, as far as she knows, Ken never returned. 
 But he got the messages. 
 Mm. 
 Well, here's the log, just dates and times. 
 I'm having so much trouble understanding this, why Ken is... 
 [Laughs] 
 This isn't... 
 Sam Hodiak wears glasses. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 No? Mm. 
 Invisible. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay. 
 What about Ken? 
 I don't remember the last time I understood him. 
 He's a sphinx. 
 I can tell you exactly what he'll say in any given situation: What music he'll like, tie he'll pick, candidate he will vote for. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But I've never had any idea what he was thinking, ever. 
 Why did you marry him? 
 Hot summer. 
 You were long gone. 
 My dad liked him. 
 So, not strong reasons. 
 I got pregnant. 
 That's a good reason. 
 [Laughs] 
 So what about you? 
 Why did you marry, you know... 
 Opal? 
 Yeah. 
 Opal. 
 Why did you marry her? 
 [Laughs] I can't remember. I can't remember. 
 I... can't remember. 
 Are you sure I can't get you a drink? 
 [Sighs] 
 Pretty sure. 
 You don't drink anymore, do you? 
 Drinking, I don't tend to make the best decisions.

 [Door closes] 
 Half. 
 I get my girl out of here, you get the other half. 
 And Hal knows I'm here. 
 You do anything, anything, and it's over for you. 
 You hear me? 
 Anything? 
 Ken... 
 We're not enemies. 
 We never were. 
 You're the one who forgot. 
 You're the one who, when I called and called and called, wouldn't answer. 
 Charlie? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Charlie? 
 Come back later, Cherry-Pop. 
 I'm busy. 
 [Knob turns] 
 You do as I say now. 
 It's all right, Ken. 
 It's all right. 
 Be free. 
 Do you remember how free we were? 
 I showed you you could finally be who you were. 
 So sweet, those nights of ours. 
 So sweet, my Kenny-Ken.
