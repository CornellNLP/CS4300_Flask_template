If she's looking for Charlie, she's got to go through me. I plow 'em all eventually. Sugar clam, what are you doing here? Charmain! This cop and Grace... that's the problem.

Right now, today, what I'd like to do is lay out a broader picture for you here. Now, Sam, you were a great cop in your day... Ron, how'd you sleep last night? Like a babe. I didn't, so unless you want to write me up for narcolepsy, I suggest you pick up the pace. Well, you know, I'm sorry that this isn't more entertaining for you, Sam, 'cause I got to say, going back through your greatest hits, uh, use of deadly force, unlawful discharge of weapon, lying under oath, illegal interrogation, coercion, drunk and disorderly, and on and on right up until today... you know, I... I got to say I am amazed that you're even still a policeman. And when I told you that you were great in your day, I mean the days that cops used to run through this city like thugs on a bender. And when I told you that I admired you, I admire the fact that you have somehow managed to bully your way into holding on to a job for 20 years that you should have been kicked out of when Ike was president. You're at the pinnacle, Sam, everybody's hero. But you know what? A pinnacle means there's only one way to go, and that's down. You can walk down quietly, or you can take a long, loud fall. You know, I thought getting a medal was gonna be a lot more fun. So what do we do? Find the witness. Why? Look, we're not gonna kill anyone. All right, that would screw up my pension. Well, I'm late. It's gonna have to wait till tomorrow. All right, just calm down. Okay, we're not gonna do anything at all. I know just the guy. Go. It's a problem, man. This cat's got a whole army on the way.

Why is it in a church? Why not a Panther Party headquarters or something? The church is a non-profit organization, so we give tax exemptions if people want to donate things. It's "we" now, huh? Well, the Panthers want to raise consciousness in the community. It needs raising, and kids are a great place to start. They need to see people not in their family working for them, motivated by love for them. So, yes, we. If you think it'll change anything. It already has. More than what you do. Here we go. You're just gone so much, and it's so dangerous, and I don't see it making much of a difference. Drugs are still everywhere, aren't they? What do you want me to say? That you'll quit. That you'll think about quitting. You're so smart. You can go to law school. You can do anything. Well, not today I can't. I'm gonna be late for not making any difference. I love you. I love you. See cops, lawyers, and jerk-off judges... you mostly just got to coast right along with their greasy games. The dumber you are, the better they feel. The more they let you slide.

Right, right, right, right right. See, see, 'cause... ha... They want... they want you to need it. See that? I mean, what does something like this even mean besides them programming you to take what they give? The idea is to kill that program, see our fears for what they really are. What are they? Steps to a higher consciousness. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Man, Charlie. King of the hippies. That's you. I ain't no hippie. I'm a slippie. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I slip right under peoples' awareness. That's how I got it done in prison. I slipped under the minds of the guards. They left me alone to take my trip, play my music. Hey, play something now. Uh... yeah, yeah. I got to, uh...

What do you think of this whole scene? You guys digging it? It's a church of greenery and scenery. Down there, it's just all smog and banks and insurance and Teflon plastic fear. There's 6 million freeways, and they can't even see where the road starts. I like that. Mm-mm. I don't know about that, though. What don't you know, huh? How aware you're not? I guess so, yeah. Never done it. He who's last shall be first. You're seeing the world through a dirty window. Don't you know that? I used to live up on Laurel, and one time, my neighbors brought home some rosewood seeds from Hawaii. "Make the doors fly open of your mind," they said, but I didn't recognize myself. I always thought I was kind of happy, gentle, and this was me finding out I was wrong, me wanting to rip and bite and burn... and make the whole world go red. So after the first time doing that, I was done. ♪ ♪ You're with me now, so... (SCOFFS) It's time to try again.

Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president. I don't think I've ever met a sculptor before. I think you should go on "What's My Line?" You'd win. Stonecutter by trade. Not quite as romantic. I wish I could make a living sculpting, but, uh, I suspect I'm not good enough. A little doubt is good for the soul. Maybe. Anyways, I keep at it. Mr. Plaza lets me use the boiler room to work, keeps my materials locked up down there for me. A patron of the arts. Or just a very kind man. Hard worker too. He's gotta be, I suspect, raising five kids on a super's salary. Five kids. He told me four. Well, he's had a hard time with his oldest, Manny... Emmanuel. Had a lot of trouble around here last year with burglaries, vandalism. Anyway, Mr. P. threw Manny out. Probably still knows his way back in, though, huh? Hey... I, uh, I took down the chains. Oh... Don't arrest me. Not my job. I'm homicide. I talked to, uh, 2F, finally. Mr. Lamb came home. We had a conversation. Turns out he's a stonecutter. He worked on the Masonic temple, the cathedral downtown. Of course, you know all that. He said that you let him keep his sculpting materials down here. Where do you... where do you... where do you store 'em for him? There. Who holds the key to that padlock? I do. That's what he said. He also said you have five children. Four daughters and one son, a 20-year-old son. He told me that. You didn't. But that's okay, Mr. Plaza, 'cause you're gonna tell me now. (CHAINS RATTLING) Manny... Manny Plaza. Emmanuel Plaza. That's a nice name. You hungry? You want a burger or something? Some fries, a shake? Nothing? Why do they call you Peanut? Is it for the reasons I think? (KNOCK AT DOOR) Hey, your missing girl, Donna Healy? The estranged husband's here. I thought he was on a business trip. No, he's in the break room. Hey. Hey. So I briefed Lieutenant Gilbert on what Lucille gave us. Yeah. He's saying he wants me to get her in a room with the DA next. That's great. You drinking again? You are gonna make a good detective. I don't care what anybody says. Hey, listen. Can you take a run at the suspect in A? I'm striking out. Okay. Suggestions? Well, his nickname is Peanut, so maybe you guys can bond over your tiny apple bags. (LAUGHING) Or... hatred of your father could be a fruitful area. Peanut. So you're a... you're a traveling salesman, Mr. Healy? What is it that you sell? Acne creams and ointments for Beechwood Pharmaceutical. And you and Donna are estranged. What estranged you two? She had started doing modeling. Now, strictly speaking, I didn't mind most of it. But when she got into the pin-up stuff, that was too much, and we argued about that a lot. Well, what's the difference between that and stripping, really, right? Yeah. I asked her to stop. She wouldn't. Then, six months ago, I told her if she didn't stop taking the pin-up jobs, she could move out, and there she went. She took your son. I showed up while she was working one day and took him to my parents. He's better off with them. And one time after he'd been with her, there was a cigarette butt in his diaper. If you had to hazard a guess as to where she was right now, where would you say your wife is? (SCOFFS) Went off with a man. She would do that and go this long without contacting you? You know, I wouldn't have thought so, but... if you would've asked would she rather quit pin-up modeling or leave me I would've said she would've quit, so maybe I don't know her that well. Who's Tina Greenwood? I don't know. Who is she? You went to high school with her. Sorry. Vineland High is a big place. Anyway, why do you ask? Yeah. (HANDCUFFS CLANKING) You got a light? Mm. So what's going on? Oh, Hodi's got another case going, so he told me to come sit in here while he's busy. Said you were stonewalling him anyway, so no rush, right? What else did he say? Hodiak? Mm-hmm. He said your dad dropped the dime on you. That true? Yeah. (SCOFFS) Unbelievable. What is? Just... someone doesn't want to have kids, then don't. But if you do, be a man about it, you know? Yeah. And I'll tell you something. If it made my dad's life any easier, he would've turned me in at the drop of a hat for anything... for the Lindbergh baby. What's he saying you did, anyway? Stab some girl in his building. Damn. Mm-hmm. And, uh... I mean, he got proof? I mean, were you even there? I don't live there anymore. You know, he kicked me out. He didn't care. I didn't have nothing. Hey, man, I had to enlist when my dad kicked me out. That's how bad off I was. I almost did that. Yeah? Yeah. Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLING) He doesn't know where his wife is. He doesn't remember the first missing girl from high school. I don't have any bodies. All I got are these damn pictures, and I can't shoot my wad on a hunch. Yeah, well, Shafe's practically got your animal writing a how-to on killing that girl. So then I came up in the elevator, and there she was in the lobby. Mmm! Now, this is the girl? Mm-hmm. She was beautiful, man. Mmm! Beautiful. Legs to next week, just... mmm! You know what I'm saying. Anyway, so we start talking, and I tell her I'm the super's son, and she says she's Marisa, and we go up on the elevator to the fifth floor. She unlocks her door but she says, "My roommate's home," so I say, "What about the roof?" Uh-huh, thinking on your feet. Okay. I like it. Okay, so we go up, and... and she's kissing me, you know? She's got my hands on her, all over her. You know? Right. And she says, "Stop now, or I'll scream." After she was kissing you? Yeah. Just two kids trying to have a good time... Talking so loud, I had to show her my blade. It was like... like being in a fight, not knowing how many punches you threw. You know? So I went down to my dad's place, and he says he's gonna help me. So he gives me a shower, hides me in the boiler room. (INHALING, EXHALING) And then he says he's gonna figure out what's what. (TENSE MUSIC) ♪ ♪ When I come out, he turns me in.

You've met Jeannie. You think I fear man's justice? Unbelievable. What can I bring? (CHUCKLES) Your appetite. Jeannie's gonna go for broke when she hears you're coming. God help us all. (HUMMING WAGNER'S "RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES") I'm sorry... for saying you don't make a difference. But I do just think that there are other things that you could be doing that would be more fulfilling, and that will let you spend some time with your family and your daughter. You're so smart, honey. You have a bright future, and I want that for you. I know you do. But I also think you're embarrassed in front of your new Panther friends. They're probably giving you a hard time about being married to a pig. That's what I think. I just got promoted. Detective Squad now, Homicide, and I will be making a difference, solving murders. So I do have a bright future. I am fulfilled, and I am gonna take a shower. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) You ready to play for me yet, Charlie? (LAUGHS) Yeah, yeah. I, uh... I had some other trips to go on, but, uh, I'm getting ready. Sounds good. But can I tell you what I feel like's going on here? Nothing's going on, man. No, no. I know. It's just that voice in your head, right? Telling you to cash it in, give it up. I know that voice. Watch your low notes. You're flattening on everything. You're shrilling on everything. I'm trying to help you, big shot. Wait... What, you think 'cause you got a couple of hits that you got it made? I can talk to you any way I want to talk to you. I'm your father.
