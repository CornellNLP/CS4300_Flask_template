 What are you doing? 
 I'm done, Cut. I quit. 
 Previously on "Aquarius"... 
 There's an open seat on the city council. 
 I can't afford a campaign. 
 It's not an election. 
 It's an appointment. 
 Let's talk about your campaign finances,  about the mysterious and large sum of money that appeared with no source. 
 Leave me alone. We'll call it even. 
 We're not. You want to explain  the concept of paying me off? 
 You were right about me, Billy. 
 I am an addict. 
 At least the thing you can't quit helps people. 
 I thought you'd be mad. 
 You're a mess. I like you anyway. 
 We will all be free when Helter Skelter starts. 
 What the hell is Helter Skelter? 
 The end of days. Beginning of all time. 
 This, the Beatles, is prophesy. 
 And I am their instrument. 
 Helter Skelter! 
 Samson Benedictus Hodiak. 
 Did you get my gift? 
 What you're doing takes a lot of work. 
 I... I just want to understand why you're going to all this trouble. 
 Why don't you use that celebrated brain of yours and figure it out before I take the next girl. 
 [siren wailing] 
 Quarter till, Sam. 
 All right, how much for another hour? 
 Another week of this, I was gonna start looking at boats. 
 You've been a gracious host. 
 I merely protect and serve. 
 Sure. 
 13 minutes. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 This is the last of them. 
 Hey. 
 I hope you're speedy. 
 There was only one fire engine working when he called me, and it was pretty close. 
 So any house within earshot of this line could be our guy. 
 He mentioned my uniform, so it's gotta be someone I cuffed when I was a uni. 
 Look at this. 
 I know him.

 ♪ ♪ [bell rings] What are you having? Coffee, please. Do I know you? I don't know, do you? Sam Hodiak. Gerald Dunn. How long you been a photographer, Gerald? Now, how do you know I take pictures, Sam? I can smell it on you. The stop bath acid. How long you been a cop, Sam? Now how did you know I was a cop? Same way I know you're not anymore. I read the papers. It's a shame how they forced you out. The scandal. Not fair. And I know how much you loved it. Eh, not lately. No? No. Too many rules. I'm kinda looking forward to doing whatever I want. To whoever I want. I'll see you around, Gerald. Ah, maybe I'll see you, Sam. Dinner's on me. ["Sugar Sugar" by the Archies playing] ♪ Sugar ♪ 
♪ Ah, honey, honey ♪ ♪ And you got me wanting you ♪ 
♪ Honey ♪ There's more where that came from. A lot more. You got it on you? The cash? One thing. I handle it. I'll make sure we don't go hungry again. Is that it? The only condition? Patty, you gotta get. ♪ Ah, sugar ♪ 
♪ Ah, honey, honey ♪ 
♪ You are my candy girl ♪ [tapping] [tapping] [tapping intensifies] [snapping] You look worse than half the drunk tank. Kristin left a while back. I haven't slept much. Oh, man. What's her excuse? [kicks desk] Yes. You wanna tell me why the night guys can't stop talking about some hot, new lady cop? Catching up on paperwork, lieutenant. When you call me by my title, I know it means ass[...]. I know about the truckload of files you pulled out of records for Sam, who's now our dearly departed citizen. We're close. To what? Lyons has the Tina Greenwood file. Everything else is just pictures. In this precinct, cases need bodies, okay? And I need cops that don't sleep on the job, so... As you say, Lieutenant. Ooh. Ooh. You really shrunk me down from all that razor sarcasm. You know the best way to work out of this funk? Big jolly handfuls of punani. Trust me on this. Jeannie and I split up four times in 21 years and every time was just balls-deep bliss. You know what I mean? Four times? Why don't you just get a divorce? We're Catholic. Daddy! Hi, honey. Wait, does Charlie know? If he sees you here... It's fine. He said I could stay. How you feeling? Oh. Happy, swollen. Here, come sing with us. What's... what's this? Helter Skelter. Helter... We're safe here. Out there, that's where it's bad. My girls. Getting ready for it. Forewarned, forearmed. Wait. Charlie? The guns. Oh, kids and their toys. Put them on an old movie set, they think they're the next Annie Oakley. What's Helter Skelter? It's not for now. [chuckles] I'll be right back. Okay, bye, Daddy. I love you. So you're asking me what I think you should do? Well, I am a patient man. Oh. Wow, thank you. But I don't ball my patients. Well, not anymore. [sighs] I found him. You did? How? When he called there was a fire engine in the background. It turns out there was only one fire in L.A. last night, and only one resident in that vicinity that I busted in 1952 for burglary. So then why don't you be done? Now. Just hand over the case to the cops. Can't. You won't. Same thing. See, the fact that you can't tell the difference between the two leads me to believe that you're gonna have a hard time in your next career. In what sense? I mean, what else are you good at, besides s*x and breakfast? Oh. Hello. A reprimand. For sleeping at my desk. Well, you did sort of hit that sweet spot, honey. You were withholding and mouthy with a commanding officer, so... Good. I'm glad you did this because I'm filing on you. Well, that's adorable. For what, pray tell? And with whom? Sexual discrimination. With the commissioner. And considering that Brian was asleep right across from me and instead of a write-up, you told him to get... What was it? "Jolly handfuls of punani." Jesus take the wheel. You have got to be an absolute hellcat in the sack, in my professional opinion. Hey. Jesus. If I ne... if I need to do a bad thing... Well, then don't as a cop. I'm asking a friend. Now, see, that's low. I know. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [knocking] Mr. Dunn. You mind coming with me, please? [sighs] [door closes] So are you going to tell me what this is about, detective? [sighs] [door closes] At the station. [engine turns over] ♪ ♪ [lock opens] ♪ ♪ [door creaks] [tense music builds] ♪ ♪ Hodiak busted you in '52. Stealing camera equipment. You filed a complaint. Said he beat the confession out of you. You got five years. Then another nine for three escape attempts. Now that's... [exhales sharply] That's 14 years. But why'd you keep trying to escape, Gerald? You're married, right? Did she wait for you? Your wife? Artie Donaldson. No campaign, no clue what he's doing. He just shows up and it's, "Hey, Artie, here's a seat on the city council." [sighs] Honey, if this is giving you fits, maybe politics isn't for you. At least I can rest. [sighs] I'm so tired. Tell. My daughter, Emma... She's not in France. Let me guess. She's a hippie. Something like that. Now plenty of politicians have survived worse than a wayward daughter. I mean, we all have secrets. We all lie. It's a creepy crawly. I've done a hundred of these. Worst thing that can happen, it makes some old rich guy question all his comforts in life, like we did to you. What is Helter Skelter? You'll have to ask Charlie. We can leave, you and me. Right now. No, we can't leave the family. It's different than before. Something... You're different. And that feels scary. But Charlie taught us if you stop fighting, the fear is gone. You have to believe that. There's only one thing left to do. Now you and Sadie know what I'm asking you for, don't you, Tex? Yeah. Tie 'em up. Use knives. Paint the walls with blood. Yes. Charlie. This stops now. It begins now. See, this is birth. Do you hear this? What he's making you do? Tex is his own man, Ken. We're ready. Not Emma, please. Emma! [grunts] [groans] [exhales, grunts] Leave something witchy. [coughs] Be proud, Ken. Tonight, your family and mine make history. Nothing. Unless this has something. Sam, I'm sorry, I got to kick him loose. I know. For whatever it's worth, I'm sure he's your guy. It's like he knows we know. And he loves it. He say anything about his wife? He didn't say anything about anything. Why? The only photos in the house. Him and a young bride. Wedding photos, 1952. That's the year I popped him and... What? [sighs] Muriel Dunn. That name seem familiar to you? It does to me. I just can't figure out how. This is Terry Melcher's house. Not no more. This ain't a creepy crawly. Charlie said whoever's inside, we kill 'em all. Helter Skelter. [car approaching] Patty, Emma, bushes. Halt. Hey. What's going on? Hi, friend. Hey! Hey! [grunts] [stabbing] [grunting] [screams] Don't! I'm not gonna tell anybody. Please just don't... [gunshots] What'd the P.O. say? Well, he served time on a peeping tom charge last year, which explains why he went dark for six months. But there were no escape attempts to try to go see Muriel. What's that about? Wait. Muriel Dunn is his wife? The 50s pin-up girl? My dad was obsessed with her. That her? I mean, yeah. I've never actually seen her with clothes on, but that is my dad's sick crush. He didn't talk for days when she died. Died? She was murdered. Actually, I think she was bound and strangled. [slamming] Good work by all. You have the thanks of a grateful retiree. Here's the film you asked me to develop. [pictures falling] [police radio chatter] [brakes screech] [sirens wail] [flashbulb pops] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [vomits] [coughs] They're off now. Couldn't stop them even if I tried. How many worlds there been, Ken? I don't know. Thousands? Millions? I don't care. You can't say because none of any of them last forever. Everything the White man has built to hold the Black man down will fall, And there'll be riots. Race wars. Stay outside. Keep watch. After tonight, the world will burn. You and your kind will die. That's... that's your plan? You actually think that that's gon... To work? [coughs] I do. See, there's a hole in the desert. The Bible tells us so. The Beatles tell me. And they have give me a key to the shaft of this bottomless pit where our family will stay and grow strong, while the world dies and rises again. Go see who else is here. [heavy breathing] What time is it? [grunting] [grunting, struggling] I'm the devil. And I'm here to do the devil's business. [struggling, grunting] No! No! What do you want? Just tell us what you want! Tell us! [screaming] What? Tell us! What? Tell us! [screaming] What do you want? Move it! What have we done? What? Shut up! Shut up, shut... [sobbing] Stop! Please, my baby... Hey! Quit sobbing, you here? Can't you see that she's pregnant? Shut up! [screaming] Can't you see that she's pregnant? [gunshot] [screaming] And when all the ash is fallen, covering the dust, we will emerge. And the Black man, tripping over his own ignorance, will welcome us. And beg us to rule. [panting] [screams] [whimpering] [thud] [grunting] [sobbing] [stabbing, grunting] Make it stop. It's done. How's that water treating you, Ken? I mixed it special for you.

Why wasn't she tied up and raped? Why wasn't she abducted? Answer me! [punches] I'm gonna hurt you, Gerald. I'm gonna hurt you until you tell me everything. [spits] [punches] [grunting] [panting] This is what Charlie wants. We're doing this for him. I know. [screaming] [footsteps] [grunting, screaming] [stabbing, screaming] Helter Skelter. [stabbing] [screaming, stabbing] Follow. [screaming] [stabbing] [shrieking] [stabbing] Go check the guest house. Kill whoever's inside. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [music volume increases] ♪ ♪ Don't make a sound. Don't come outside. You don't want answers, you just want me dead. I know. I get it. That what happened with Muriel? Is that how you killed your wife? [laughs] Jesus Christ. Sure don't know what you're laughing at. Number one detective. That's you. That's what put me in prison for 14 years. Your police genius. My wife was killed in '64. Yes. While I was in Soledad. With 2 1/2 years to go. And you blame me for that? Because I put you in prison, and you couldn't protect her, you blame me? And you're making your tragedy everybody else's? What is this, revenge? That's what you want? You want to make everybody else feel what you feel? Do it, Sam. Or you're gonna hear how she begged. You're gonna hear how she cried. You're gonna hear what the hammer claw sounded like... Sam? When I got it deep in that pretty face of hers. Sam? Stop it. Just keep going, keep going. Go! Shafe, get out of here! Put the gun down. Sam, would you think? We don't have the whole story here. We don't know know where all the pieces are and if you kill him, we never will. Put the gun down.

So you surprised her... Whatever you're putting together right now... And you killed her... We can do it... Right then and there, At the station, together. Which you never do, you never kill them right there. Sam! Or in this house! But you need your camera. So you left to go get it. Let's just... Please, put the gun down. You came here.

But it is helping me see. All the way into your heart. [laughs] No, Ken. I'm a mirror. It's your own sin shining back on you. Don't, I... I... I can't stomach another helping of your stolen profundity. Stolen? [laughs] Carnegie, Heinliein, the Old Testament, New, Lennon and McCartney, and whatever gutter rat taught you to trade ass for money. You're not a guru. You're not even a murderer. You're a fraud. You're not afraid of going to prison. You're afraid of being out in this world. That's what the whole "family" is... A shelter. A "Helter Shelter." For your cowardice. Oh, Ken. I thought I'd opened your eyes. Your mother didn't love you. And now you crave anyone to make you feel less alone. Poor, poor, little Charlie. That doesn't feel good, does it? Doesn't feel good for Charlie. Poor Charlie. He's like a blind child leading an army, and wondering, why in God's name nobody is stopping you. Charlie, that's... That's too tight. Charlie. Ch...

You think he's gonna get arrested? Stand trial? Get the death sentence? You think that's how it works? That's the way it used to work. I did everything I could to make this country work. I went to war. I became a cop. And yes, I did terrible things and I called it justice. Things that if you knew, if you really knew me, you'd be gone. Man is a sick animal, and this is a sick man.
