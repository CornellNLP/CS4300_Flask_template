 Did you pack your retainer? GIRL: Yup! 
 You have to wear it for ten hours tonight, so put it in after din... 
 After dinner. Got it covered, Mom. 
 And don't you forget to put on the alarm system before you go to bed. 
 Did I forget last night? 
 Yes, you did. 
 Ugh! What would I do without you? 
 (doorbell rings) 
 She'll be right down. 
 Well, hello to you, too, Elaine. 
 With a liveried driver now? 
 She rolls up to school in that? 
 What? Chloe likes it. 
 Makes her feel important. 
 Makes you feel important, Roger. I'm sure it makes Chloe feel embarrassed. 
 I was embarrassed being dropped off at school every day because my father was poor. 
 Chloe's embarrassed because her father's rich? 
 Just tell him to lose the chauffeur's hat, okay? 
 Hi, Daddy. Hey, sweetheart. 
 Did you notice Mom's awesome new haircut? 
 Doesn't it make her look ten years younger? 
 You better get going. 
 See you, Mom. 
 Love you, Chloe. 
 Love you, too. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 The Templeton verdict just came in. 
 Convicted on all counts except fraud. 
 Good work, Counselor. 
 Hey, thought you'd want to know, Albany came through with the funding for the Joint-Fitter's Union investigation. 
 Congratulations. Yeah. 
 Sorry. Uh, I was... 
 I was at this slot car racetrack last weekend, and I saw this picture up on the wall... I could have sworn it was you and your brothers as kids. 
 That old Kensington place. 
 That's still open? 
 What were you doing there? 
 Oh, I take my nephews over there for the weekend sometimes, give my sister a break. 
 You do? Mm, yeah. 
 What? 
 No. I just... 
 I just didn't see you as the doting uncle type, I guess. 
 Oh, you didn't, huh? 
 ERIN: No. Well, maybe you don't know everything about me. 
 I guess I don't. 
 Hey. 
 It's after school already? 
 Yup, it is. 
 You must be Nicky. 
 This is my boss, Mr. Rossellini. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I saw you on TV. 
 Oh, Dancing with the Stars? 
 (laughs) Yeah, right. 
 Wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait. You don't think I can dance? 
 Uh, no. I just... I... 
 Actually... My mom's a great dancer. 
 I am not a great dancer. 
 I'm sure she is, and I'm sure you're fantastic. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 When you Reagan women are ready to settle this on the dance floor... 
 (laughing) 
 let me know. 
 (girls laughing) 
 Mr. Bates is such a tool. 
 I hate algebra. 
 Hey, did you finish reading Jane Eyre? 
 No, but if I had Jane Eyre's aunt, I'd light her bonnet on fire. 
 Well, we have that test on Monday. 
 Some Happy Valentine's present. 
 I know. 
 Cliffs Notes? 
 Mrs. Levitt makes her tests Cliffs Notes-proof. 
 Ugh! There's no way I'm reading 
 150 pages this weekend. 
 Hey, I have an idea. 
 I'll read 75 pages, and you read 75 pages. 
 We'll talk on Sunday night and then tell each other what happened. 
 Genius. Text me later. 
 Okay. 
 Peace out, Girl Scout. 
 (engine revving, tires squealing) 
 Stop! Stop! 
 MAN: What the hell are you doing, man? Help! Help! 
 (screaming) 
 (tires squealing) 
 MAN: That guy just grabbed a little girl. Did you see that? 
 (phone buzzing) 
 ROGER: That's right, my friend... you're a loser. 
 I thought you were liquidating those positions. 
 What, you out of your mind? 
 (laughs) 
 Hold on a second. 
 I got to take this. It's my daughter. 
 Hey, sweetheart. What's up? 
 DISTORTED MALE VOICE: Listen to me and do what I say if you want to see Chloe again. 
 What?! Who is this? 
 I want $5 million in diamonds by tomorrow. 
 If the stones are watermarked or tagged in any way, your daughter's dead. 
 What is this, some kind of joke? 
 CHLOE: Daddy? Daddy? 
 Chloe? 
 Daddy, help me. 
 Chloe, are you all right? 
 Help me, Daddy, I'm scared. 
 DISTORTED MALE VOICE: I'll give you the time and place tomorrow. 
 Don't even think about calling the cops. 
 (line click) 
 Chloe? Baby, are you there?

 Hey. 
 Detective Reagan. 
 Where's the parents? 
 They're at the top of the stairs. All right. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Carson. 
 Detective Reagan. This is my partner, Detective Curatola. They said they'd call back tomorrow, but they could call sooner, don't you think? 
 ROGER: The diamonds are arranged for. 
 There's a Pinkerton guard bringing them over. 
 I was assured you were the top guy. 
 My partner and I will do everything we can to help you get your daughter back, I can assure you of that. 
 Okay, so you two have joint custody? 
 ELAINE: He has Chloe Tuesdays, Fridays and every other weekend. This weekend. 
 They won't be able to tell there's surveillance, will they? 
 They said no cops. 
 We're taking every precaution. 
 Is there anyone else who might have known Chloe's routine? 
 What time she left school, the route she took? 
 Just us, Chloe's friends, my housekeeper and driver. 
 ELAINE: What did I tell you, Roger? 
 Chauffeuring her around in that ridiculous car, screaming money. 
 You were the one who wanted her to walk everywhere. 
 If Hugo had picked her up, we wouldn't be in this... 
 You're blaming me for this? 
 (Danny clears his throat) 
 Mr. and Mrs. Carson, I'm a parent. 
 I know this must be very hard on you, but we really need you to work together if we're gonna help get Chloe back to you, okay? 
 Sweetheart, have this tea. It's calming. 
 And you are...? 
 Vanessa Morris. 
 My girlfriend. His fiancée. 
 Do you live here? 
 How is that relevant? 
 I'm just trying to get the full story here. 
 So, we did speak to a, uh, Lila, the girl Chloe was walking with. 
 They're best friends. 
 DANNY: Is there anyone else we should speak to? 
 Did she have a boyfriend? 
 No. VANESSA: No. 
 She would have told me that. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 Um, we're gonna need to see Chloe's bedroom. 
 It's right over here. 
 (gasps) 
 Oh, no! 
 Oh. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Oh, sorry, Mister. 
 Inez... it's nothing. 
 The mayor gave it to me. 
 Come on. 
 I'll fix it. 
 I'll pay for it. 
 You okay? 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 Did your sister go back in the hospital? 
 No, no, no. She's... 
 The chemotherapy was very good. 
 She's fine, thank you. 
 Inez, something's wrong. 
 My youngest boy. 
 Eddie, isn't it? 
 He got arrested last night. 
 What for? 
 He didn't do it. 
 What happened? 
 He was going to visit a friend at work, and-and... a cop car came, and-and someone in the car pointed at Eddie and said, "He's the one." 
 He said that Eddie robbed him with a gun. 
 That's a serious charge. 
 It's a mistake. 
 He's never touched a gun in his life. 
 He's a good boy. 
 Inez, the police commissioner cannot interfere with an ongoing investigation. 
 Oh, no, Commissioner. 
 No. I would never. 
 Oh, please. No. 
 No. I'm sorry. 
 I-I say too much already. 
 I... Inez. 
 I'm going. 
 I clean your office. 
 I'm all done, see? 
 This is interesting. 
 Chloe's cell phone records. 
 The only call she received other than from her mother and father every single day was from a burner cell. 
 What, no name, paid in full? 
 Calls started in September, ran right up to yesterday. 
 They stopped pinging off a cell phone tower in Southampton, and started pinging off a cell phone tower in the West Village. What do you think? 
 A summer romance? I don't know. 
 It's a secret romance. 
 Either way, we might have ourselves our first lead. 
 So, uh, you been dating anyone since you and Sydney broke up? 
 Oh, here and there. Nothing serious. Why? 
 Uh, Valentine's Day is coming up. 
 I was wondering maybe if you got any big plans. 
 Nope. Nothing. What about you? 
 As a matter of fact, I do. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 'Cause I don't know how you're gonna improve on that snow globe that you got your wife for your anniversary. 
 Hey, she shakes that snow globe every day, I'll have you know. 
 Says it makes her feel peaceful. 
 But Valentine's Day... that's when I go all out, kid. 
 What's all out for you, Sarge? 
 Two-for-one Mondays at the Pig-n-Whistle? 
 What would you say to a window table at the Waterfront Cafe? 
 With a view of Manhattan and a bottle of champagne sitting on the table, chilled, waiting for us? 
 I'd say that sounds pretty romantic. 
 Yeah? Well, uh, that ain't where I'm taking her. 
 At least, not till I make captain's money. 
 But I do make a pasta fazool that she loves. 
 Your wife's a very lucky woman. 
 She is. 
 Hey, Lila? 
 Hey, we need to ask you a few more questions. 
 Did you find Chloe? 
 We're working on it. 
 Look, um, she's been receiving calls almost every day from a burner cell, which means we can't identify the caller. 
 Do you have any idea who that might be? 
 No. Sorry. 
 JACKIE: Look, Lila, I was your age once, and I had a best friend and we knew everything about each other. 
 DANNY: Lila, look, you probably think you're protecting Chloe, but you're not. This person could be involved. 
 This person could even be the kidnapper. 
 It wasn't. 
 DANNY: How do you know that? 
 Because... it's her boyfriend. 
 What's his name? 
 Drew. Drew what? 
 I don't know his last name. 
 He worked as a lifeguard in the Hamptons last summer. 
 Talks like this, but he's really cute, and they love each other. 
 Chloe's dad hated him. 
 So she was seeing him behind the dad's back? 
 Her mom didn't like him, either. 
 He's 19 
 and doesn't go to college. 
 He come into the city to see her? 
 Almost every weekend. 
 He crashed at this scary loft in Bushwick where a bunch of stoners live. 
 Do you have the address? 
 Uh-uh. 
 Only way I'm going to Bushwick is in an army tank. 
 Well, I'm willing to bet you probably got a picture of Chloe with him in that phone of yours right there. 
 Look, we're going to e-mail this to ourselves, all right? 
 You don't worry. You're doing the right thing. 
 Take it easy. 
 The boyfriend loves her. 
 Eh. Or loves her father's money. 
 (chuckles) Yeah. 
 So why hasn't the kidnapper called? 
 He'll call, Mr. Carson. 
 Okay? Just try to relax. 
 It's torture. Isn't it, sweetheart? 
 All right. What about Chloe's boyfriend Drew? 
 You mean that lifeguard? 
 I ended that. 
 He was too old and mature for her. 
 Well, we have reason to believe that she's still seeing him. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Quiet down! 
 (ringing continues) 
 Yeah. All right, we're on. Mr. Carson, come on. 
 Settle down! 
 I want you to buy a little time. 
 All right? You want to speak to your daughter. 
 Most important, you want to stay calm, all right? 
 We ready to go? 
 Yeah. Okay. Settle! 
 Hello? 
 DISTORTED MALE VOICE: Meet me at the corner of St. Mark's Place and First Avenue at 2:00. 
 I'll be wearing a yellow baseball cap. 
 Do you have the diamonds? 
 Yes, they're here. Uh... 
 Uh, where did you say to meet you? 
 I just have to write it down. 
 Shut up and listen. 
 Put the diamonds in a metal thermos. No GPS, and no cops, if you want to see your daughter again. 
 I want to talk to Chloe. 
 CHLOE: Daddy? 
 Hey, baby. 
 Listen, I'm going to get you out of this, okay? 
 Where's Mom? 
 Uh, she's right here. Hold on. 
 Sweetheart, are you all right? 
 Mommy. Mommy, I'm so scared. 
 Chloe? 
 Chloe?! East Third and Bowery. 
 We can send a radio car. No. The caller's going to be in the wind. We got to move. 
 Rog, she sounded awful. 
 I'm going to get her back, Elaine, I promise. 
 So what happens now? 
 We got an hour to set up surveillance. 
 We'll make the drop, and we'll follow him to your daughter. 
 Well, he said no cops. 
 Listen, you're gonna do the drop, then you'll move off. 
 They won't make us. Don't worry. 
 But what if they do? I just want my daughter back! 
 They won't make us, Mr. Carson. Please. Just trust me, okay? 
 They won't make us. We'll get your daughter back. 
 We've got to trust them. 
 Listen to the detectives. 
 They know what they're doing. 
 No pressure. Yeah, right. 
 Let's go. 
 (siren wailing) 
 (Danny sighs) 
 You get a look at those diamonds? 
 Mmm. 
 It's hard to believe something so small could be worth a girl's life. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All right, there's our boy. 
 Yellow hoodie and the baseball hat. 
 He looks like a homeless guy. 
 (over radio): You got something for me? 
 Where's my daughter? 
 What? 
 Tell me where my daughter is! 
 What the hell's wrong with you, man? 
 Get off me! 
 If anything happens to her... 
 Come on. Give him the diamonds already. 
 I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you with my own hands. 
 All right. He made the exchange. 
 Green coat, yellow hat. 
 We got him in sight. 
 We're on him. 
 JACKIE: Be advised, the payoff went down. 
 Suspect is a white male, approximately 36, heading east on St. Mark's, wearing a yellow hat. 
 Stay with him. 
 WOMAN: Hey, watch out. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (people conversing indistinctly nearby) 
 Looks like he's waiting for someone. 
 Hold fast. 
 What's he doing with the diamonds? 
 Let's move. 
 Hey! 
 Come here. Come here. 
 Get off of me. I didn't do anything. 
 Shut up. Where's the girl? Here's the ransom. 
 Give me my hundred bucks! Where's the girl? 
 What girl? Just give me my money. 
 Money for what? 
 Huh? 
 You promised me a hundred bucks. We had a deal. 
 I didn't promise you anything, dipstick. 
 I'm a cop. Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on. 
 Let's hold on a minute. 
 Why don't you two go down the street and have a cup of coffee? 
 I can't let you go in there alone, sir. 
 It's a pastry shop, Baker. 
 It's protocol, sir. 
 Okay, I'm your boss, right? 
 Yes, sir. 
 I order you two to go down the street and have a cup of coffee. 
 If you're not out in ten minutes, we're coming in. 
 Weapons drawn, I expect. 
 Thank you. Have a nice day. 
 (sighs) 
 Commissioner. 
 Please sit down. 
 This place was on my old beat. 
 I'm sorry about all the intrigue, Detective Ryan. I didn't want to go to the precinct. 
 It always turns into such a big deal. 
 But I could use some advice. 
 Yes, sir. 
 You collared a suspect the other day, Edward Saldana. 
 Uh, yes, sir. Armed robbery. 
 Well, the vic made a positive I.D. on the canvass soon after the incident. 
 And Saldana, he didn't have the gun or the vic's wallet, but he had the contents. 
 Yeah. Most of a hundred bucks and the Metro Card. 
 Saldana told me that he was on the East Side to visit a friend, sir, in a building that he worked in, and the friend was not there. 
 Pretty thin alibi. 
 I read your fives. 
 Looks like a good arrest. 
 Here's my problem. 
 I know the mother. 
 I met the kid. 
 He didn't seem likely to go bad. 
 But that was a long time ago. 
 We always say that it's just as important to work hard to exonerate an innocent person as it is to convict a guilty one. 
 If you think it warrants a second look... 
 What a surprise. 
 I told you, I've never seen that guy before. 
 Somebody came up to me, offered me a hundred bucks to pick up a thermos. 
 What did he look like? 
 I have no idea. 
 He had a ski mask on. 
 And that didn't strike you as odd? 
 It's freezing out. 
 I wish I had one. 
 You're not going to have to worry about the cold weather much longer. We've got you on an active burglary warrant. 
 Now you're a co-defendant in a kidnapping. 
 Kidnapping? 
 You're out of your mind, man. 
 Hey! You're out of your mind. Whoa! 
 Now, who hired you? 
 Who hired you to pick up the ransom, you junkie? 
 Ransom? I mean, it was a hundred bucks. 
 He offered me a hundred bucks. 
 Hey, I just want my hundred bucks to score, to f-fix. 
 I just want a fix. Please. All right? 
 He's probably telling the truth. 
 Why don't you book him, take him down to Bellevue, get him a little methadone. 
 I'll go do the heavy lifting with the family. 
 Well, I owe you one. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Carson. 
 Where's Chloe? What happened? 
 We didn't get her. 
 The guy with the yellow cap turned out to be a messenger. I'm sorry. 
 So you don't know where Chloe is? 
 What did he just say, Vanessa? 
 Look, I understand your frustration. 
 No, you don't! 
 Chloe's not your daughter! 
 ELAINE: Rog, please. The kidnappers want the ransom. 
 They're-they're going to call back. 
 Something happened, that's all. 
 I know, I just... 
 I feel helpless. 
 It's okay. We're not giving up yet. 
 (phone ringing) Excuse me. 
 Please tell me you got something. 
 Okay, the boyfriend's name is Drew Leland. 
 He's in the system for a no-contest misdemeanor assault back in high school. 
 I went to the parents. 
 They say he took a job line-fishing some blue fin tuna out in Montauk, and they don't have any idea when he's coming back. 
 Okay. What about this Bushwick loft he's been hanging out in? 
 Do his parents have an address for that? 
 The parents don't even know it exists. 
 But his bank records indicate a purchase on his debit card to buy some caviar at Dean and Deluca in SoHo. 
 Guess when? Yesterday. 
 Great. Drew and his accomplice, celebrating the $5 million ransom. 
 Exactly. 
 All right. I'll talk to you in a minute. 
 Thanks. 
 ELAINE: Is there news? 
 They found the kidnap van in an alley in Brooklyn. 
 I'm gonna head over there now. What about Chloe? 
 It's just the car, but I'm going to go over there. 
 I'm going to see what's over there and I'll call you. 
 Sit tight, okay? 
 (siren chirping) 
 DANNY: What do we got? 
 A guy walking his dog saw a fire in an ash can and called it in. 
 Officer on the scene made the van from the Finest message. 
 Did he? Good eyes. Yeah. 
 Somebody knew what they were doing, though. 
 I'm not getting any prints off the steering wheel, gearshift or door handles. 
 Nothing? Uh-uh. 
 
 
 
 JACKIE: Hey, Reagan. 
 Hey. Come check this out. 
 Thanks. 
 What do you got? 
 Ooh. 
 Bottle of Dom Pérignon, the king of champagnes. 
 Huh. Doesn't exactly look like a Dom Pérignon kind of neighborhood. 
 No. What is that, caviar? 
 JACKIE: Yeah. 
 Maybe Mr. Dean and Deluca was here. 
 Yeah. 
 Look at that lipstick on the glass. 
 DANNY: Lipstick. 
 What do you think, it was a female driver? 
 Or it's Chloe's. 
 Then there's that. 
 Okay, lipstick on the glass, but the van's perfectly clean. 
 I can't figure out if this is a kidnapping or a date. 
 Well, if this is a kidnapping, I'd like to be kidnapped next Valentine's Day. 
 What about the champagne flutes? 
 Amazing. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Let me guess. 
 The prints on the glass were Chloe's, and the ones on the bottle on the other glass were... 
 Drew Leland. Yeah. 
 Looks like Romeo and Juliet were having themselves a little bit of a party. 
 Couple of kids trying to run off with the parents' money. 
 Awesome. I'm gonna go to the old man's and eat dinner. 
 (bell tolling) 
 SEAN: Bless us, our Lord, for these gifts we're about to receive from your bountiful hands. 
 Amen. 
 ALL: Amen. Well done. 
 I smell something delicious. 
 What is it? 
 Bossa nova. 
 Your Aunt Erin make it. 
 Osso buco, Grandpa. 
 Bossa nova, osso buco. 
 What's the difference? 
 But, Mom, like, what is it? 
 It's braised veal shanks. 
 Oh. 
 DANNY: Hey, everyone. Hey. Hi. 
 SEAN: Hi, Dad. Hi, boys. Hey. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Hey, Gramps. 
 How's it going out there? 
 DANNY: Ah, crazy case, Dad. 
 We just had to tell these parents the daughter probably staged her own kidnapping. 
 What? Oh, yeah. 
 They're not buying it, though. 
 It's like talking to a wall. 
 Why you think, for the money? 
 I don't know. 
 I haven't figured that part out yet. 
 We just arranged a ransom pickup. 
 Nobody showed up. 
 Wow. Even so, poor parents. 
 Well, they're not exactly poor. 
 In fact, they're very rich. 
 It's just a messy situation. 
 Divorce, live-in girlfriend, you know. 
 Okay, let's change the subject. 
 Why? I'm not upset about Dad's girlfriend. Are you? 
 No. 
 He's taking her to Anguilla for Valentine's Day, but Mom and I have a date, right, Mom? 
 That's right. 
 Nicky wanted to have Peking Duck in the city, so, Peking Duck she will have. 
 Valentine's Day. Ug! 
 Why? 
 Because it's one of those holidays that is dreamed up by the greeting card companies. 
 (chuckles) 
 What's a greeting card? 
 LINDA: Mm. It's something people used to send before e-cards, honey. 
 I'm making Mom a nice card in school, but it's a surprise. 
 (laughter) 
 Is that another Reagan trait, Grandpa? 
 Do you think it's hooey? 
 Well, I thought it was great, but your Grandma Mary didn't like making a big deal out of it. 
 She always hated the idea of being required to express her love on a certain day. 
 Well, that's Mom to a tee. 
 Reagan women don't like to be told what to do. 
 No, we don't. JAMIE: Still, it's one of those days. 
 You know, you're supposed to be hooked up, and it's a reminder if you're not. 
 You know, it's like a pressure point, like New Year's Eve. 
 What do you mean by that... pressure point? I don't know. 
 It's just one of those days when you're supposed to be happy, or you measure your happiness. 
 Some people propose, other people are disappointed by their mates, or if they're alone, it exacerbates their loneliness. 
 You know, you may be a genius, kid. 
 Exacerbate. Worsen. No, no. 
 The whole Valentine's Day, pressure point thing. 
 I'm gonna get back to work. 
 Okay, Dad? 
 You just got here. 
 I got to get back to work. 
 Pork chops were great. 
 Pork chops. 
 What? 
 Go! Lamb chops. Whatever. 
 Come on, go. Bye. Bye, boys. 
 (plates clattering) 
 Are you busy, Grandpa? 
 Not for you. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, I was thinking about your grandma. 
 I found this box after she died. 
 You know what I said about how she felt about Valentine's Day. 
 Well... turns out she saved every Valentine's Day card I ever gave her, 40 years worth. 
 You miss her. 
 Every day. 
 So what's up? 
 I think I might have screwed up. 
 Oh? 
 I-I just didn't want Mom to be alone on Valentine's Day. 
 Well, she's not gonna be. 
 You're going out for Peking Duck. 
 Well, that's only half the story. 
 I called her boss and asked him to meet us, and I was going to ask you or Uncle Jamie or someone to come get me. 
 You called Charley Rossellini? 
 I saw them talking after school, and you could tell they liked each other. 
 (sighs) 
 Well, I'll be honest. 
 I don't like the guy. 
 But that's beside the point. 
 Why do you think you screwed up? 
 I don't know. 
 I thought it was a really good idea. 
 Hmm. 
 Just, after I hung up, I was sorry I did it. 
 I mean, I want her to be happy, I do. 
 Do you like my dad? 
 I like your dad. 
 (sighs) 
 But I love my daughter. 
 That's what happens in divorce. 
 People feel like they got to take sides. 
 But you don't. 
 Nicky, school night. We have to go. 
 Okay, Mom. 
 Good night, Grandpa. 
 Good night, sweetheart. 
 (sighs) 
 No phone calls, e-mails, nothing. 
 Task force is chasing down the boyfriend's Bushwick address. 
 DANNY: In the, uh... 
 (clears throat) 
 ...meantime. 
 We wanted to ask you, uh, and Ms. Morris a few questions of a personal nature about your relationship. 
 We're all adults here. 
 DANNY: Oh, okay. Well, um, you know, in a situation like this, we always have to wonder why. 
 As in, if Chloe did, in fact, plan her own kidnapping, why would she do that? I mean, what would trigger her? 
 And? 
 DANNY: Well, the other day, when you two discussed your relationship, you referred to Ms. Morris as your girlfriend, but she referred to you as her fiancée. 
 I mean, Valentine's Day... you know it's a big day for relationships. 
 So I was wondering, did you two have any plans? 
 We were going to dinner. 
 Dinner? 
 You kept saying it was going to be so special. 
 Valentine's Day tasting menu at Per Se? 
 I'd call that special... a thousand dollars a pop. 
 VANESSA: I was thinking you were going to propose. 
 (sighs) 
 (phone ringing) 
 Ms. Morris, did you by any chance tell Chloe that her dad was planning on proposing to you? 
 Well, but... why wouldn't I? 
 We're really close. 
 I-I love Chloe. 
 ROGER: You told Chloe we were getting married? 
 What were you thinking? 
 I was thinking that you loved me, and that it was time. 
 JACKIE: So, particulars of Drew Leland's Internet account came in. 
 Seems like he's been downloading some movies lately. 
 Uh, Taken, Trapped, and Excess Baggage. 
 It's about a rich girl faking her own kidnapping. 
 Right. 
 Oh, God. DANNY: We got an address for that account? Yeah. 
 All right, you know what? 
 We'll notify ESU and the Hostage Negotiating team on the way. 
 You two sit tight. We'll get back to you. 
 Let's go get him. 
 We're in. Let's move, let's move. 
 All right, going right. Going right. 
 (speaking indistinctly) 
 We're clear. 
 Clear. 
 Clear! 
 Hey, Jack, we got a fresh one in here. 
 JACKIE: Yeah. 
 (Danny sighs) 
 Rest is clear. What's this? 
 We got the boyfriend, Drew Leland. Oh. 
 Yeah... The ex-boyfriend. 
 It would explain why he didn't show up for the ransom yesterday. 
 JACKIE: Well, unless Chloe shot him, third person theory is correct. 
 Then Chloe's not just in the hands of a kidnapper anymore. 
 She's in the hands of a murderer. Yeah. 
 (sighs) 
 12 of us live here. We come and go at all different times. 
 I just got back. 
 Drew's here, like, half the month? 
 Before now, have you seen Drew here in the last two days? 
 No, man. He's got... 
 His room has its own entrance. 
 I didn't even know he was here. 
 It's, like, freaking me out that somebody killed him. 
 You ever see this girl here? A couple times. 
 Yeah. I passed her on the way to the, uh, bathroom, but, um, I mean, I don't really know her. 
 Well, we're thinking this girl and Drew may have planned to fake her own kidnapping. 
 Problem is, they got someone else involved now who has taken over. 
 We need to find out who that person is. 
 Oh, man, that sucks. 
 So, uh, this Drew... does he hang out with anyone who was violent or had a drug problem? I don't know, man. 
 Um, this is, like, a lot for me right now. 
 (phone ringing) 
 (sighs) Excuse me. 
 You see that graffiti over there? 
 Take a look at it. 
 I saw that same thing up in Drew's room over there. 
 You know who wrote it? 
 Yeah, man. That's Taze. 
 He's a graffiti artist. 
 Drew buys pot off him. 
 He's, uh... 
 (chuckles) 
 He's intense. Ow. 
 He's not half as intense as me, you knucklehead. Now, your buddy Drew just got killed. 
 Don't you think we might want to know who this Taze is? 
 Huh? Where's he live? 
 A squat somewhere in East New York, an old factory... 
 (sighs) Can you just, like, chill out, man? 
 JACKIE: Reagan, uh, that was a TARU tech over at Carson's loft. 
 It seems that an e-mail just came in from a dummy e-mail address, and there's a video attached. 
 I'm not looking for diamonds. 
 I want a million in cash. 
 Put it in a duffel bag, and bring it to the playground at Tompkins Square Park tomorrow at noon. 
 Unmarked bills. 
 If you're not there alone with the money, I kill your daughter. 
 (Chloe whimpers and cries) 
 You got something to say to Daddy, little girl? 
 (Chloe crying) 
 (crying): Daddy, I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry, Daddy. 
 KIDNAPPER: I don't think she likes it here, Daddy. 
 Oh, my God. Oh, my baby. 
 DANNY: Mrs. Carson, it's okay. 
 ELAINE: What is he doing? It's okay. Look... 
 What's going on? It's all right. 
 Why don't you take her in the other room. 
 She's going to be all right. No... (sobbing) 
 ROGER: Elaine, sweetheart, come on. It's okay. 
 Shh, shh. It's all right. 
 Come on. Let's take this back to the beginning, all right? 
 It looks like they're in some abandoned factory. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Roll it nice and slow. Frame by frame. 
 You see the windows there? 
 They're washed out from the, uh, the light in the background there. 
 Try to get a shot of one of the windows, okay? Just the window. 
 Right there. Right there. Stop. 
 Okay, just darken the background a little bit. There you go. 
 All right. 
 Zoom in a little bit. 
 That's the, uh... 
 That's the Gates Avenue Armory, isn't it? 
 Yeah, I think that's the south side. So... 
 This must have been shot from East New York. 
 East New York is where we found the kidnap van. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 DANNY: So that would be Taze. 
 Shut up. 
 (muffled sobbing) 
 Shut up! 
 Or I'll kill you now. 
 Rich little bitch like you. 
 Rich girl like you, got no idea how hard it is. 
 How hard I had it. 
 (Chloe sobbing) 
 (Chloe sobbing) 
 I'm gonna be a new man, a rich man. 
 (Chloe sobbing) 
 (Taze speaking indistinctly) 
 (Chloe screaming) 
 Hey, Taze, drop the weapon and step away from the girl! 
 I said, drop the weapon and step away from the girl! 
 Right now! 
 You got nowhere to go, Taze! 
 Nice and easy. 
 TAZE: Nowhere to go? 
 That's it. All this is for me? 
 Take it easy. For me? 
 Take it easy. Step to the side. 
 I said, step aside! 
 All right. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 (thud) 
 OFFICER: Move in, move in, move in. 
 He's down. Let's go. 
 Perp is down. Check him out. 
 Okay, okay. 
 It's okay. 
 (Chloe sobbing) 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 I'm sorry. It's all right. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Is he gone? Yeah. 
 OFFICER: Get EMTs in there now. 
 CHLOE: I'm sorry! 
 (sobbing continues) 
 It was my idea. 
 Drew said he would help me because he loved me so much. 
 (over intercom): He was just supposed to kidnap me, but then we realized we needed someone else to drive the car. 
 Taze? 
 And you guys paid him? 
 A hundred bucks. 
 We said good-bye to him when we dumped the car. 
 But then he heard about the diamonds, and he came... he came to Drew's apartment with a gun and... said he was going to kill me if Drew didn't split the ransom. 
 (sniffling) 
 Drew tried to protect me. 
 And Taze shot him. 
 There wasn't going to be anything to split with him, anyway. We were going to... 
 We were going to put the diamonds in a safe deposit box, and then I was going to show up at my dad's house like someone dropped me off. 
 So you weren't going to cash in on these diamonds and run away? 
 Then why did you do it, Chloe? 
 I don't know. 
 Come on, Chloe. 
 (sobs) 
 I thought maybe... maybe Mom and Dad would be so... would be so worried about me, maybe Mom would... stop being mad-mad at Dad and it would bring them back together again. 
 (sobbing) 
 Sit tight. 
 Come on. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Mom! 
 Daddy! 
 Okay. 
 Incredible. 
 Yeah. 
 Looks like her cockamamy plan might actually work. 
 Stupid kid. 
 (sighs) 
 Knock, knock. Who's there? 
 Can I come in? 
 "Can I come in" who? 
 I'm trying to be serious. 
 Uh-oh. 
 I'm, um... 
 I'm sorry it's so late notice, but you've been out of the office all day. 
 You found out about tonight. 
 Now, that Nicky, she's a persuasive kid. 
 Not that it took a lot of persuading. 
 She should never have put you in that position. 
 What did I just say? 
 It wasn't exactly a hard sell. 
 Right. But you know it would... 
 You know it's a bad idea. 
 Because I'm your boss? 
 All right. You know, I won't be your boss if I get elected mayor. 
 And then you fire my father. 
 Who says I'd do that? 
 Okay, well, even if you didn't, and we were an item, how do you think that it would look? 
 Come on, Reagan, loosen up. 
 Politics and government... they're incestuous by nature. 
 I'm sorry. You know, I think, for Nicky, she got ahead of herself, and she's not really ready... 
 Hey. 
 It's Valentine's Day. 
 Your daughter made us a nice dinner reservation. 
 I put on my lucky purple tie. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I have other plans. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. 
 Um... 
 Good night. 
 It would have been fun. 
 Yeah. 
 (phone rings) 
 Detective Ryan. 
 Sir, I decided to look further into the Saldana case, and I asked Transit Special Investigations to run the Metro Card in his possession, check his whereabouts that night. 
 That's not something an arresting officer would normally do. 
 Although, hopefully, a good defense attorney would. 
 What do you think? 
 Well, Saldana used his Metro Card at the Nevins station in Brooklyn at 20:30 hours. 
 Which means that he would have been on the six train at the time of the robbery. 
 I also asked them to run the victim's credit cards while Eddie was in custody, somebody else was making charges. 
 That's good work, Detective. 
 You know, it's as important to work hard to exonerate an innocent victim as it is to convict a guilty one. 
 Well, that being said, you still have an armed robber at large in your precinct. 
 I'm on it, sir. 
 Good night, Inez. 
 Good night. Commissioner? 
 You should know my son Eddie was released this afternoon and the charges were dropped against him. 
 Always nice to hear good news. 
 Happy Valentine's Day. 
 Same to you, Inez. 
 Hi. Reservation for two, under Boyle. 
 Nicky Boyle. 
 Here's our girl. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. Hey. 
 Happy Valentine's Day, Mom. 
 What is this? 
 A meeting of the Lonely Hearts Club. 
 Otherwise known as the Reagan family. 
 Well, what a nice surprise. 
 We thought so. 
 This is very romantic. 
 Not. 
 (chuckles) 
 ERIN: Five unattached Reagans. 
 I don't know what to say about that. 
 Better luck next year? 
 (laughs): Yeah. 
 (all laughing) 
 To better luck next year. 
 HENRY: To better luck next year. NICKY: Better luck next year. 
 Better luck next year. 
 Hey. Ho. 
 (glasses clinking) 
 (talking indistinctly and laughing)
