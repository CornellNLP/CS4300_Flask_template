 (Henry clears his throat) 
 Morning, Pop. You're up early. 
 Uh, couldn't sleep. 
 You've been up since 3:30. 
 I heard you banging around. 
 Well... mayor's coming in. 
 He's on my case about the budget. 
 You've been thinking about Joe. 
 I always think about Joe. 
 It's coming up on two years. 
 Our kids are supposed to bury  us. 
 I know I didn't personally order that warrant enforced, but I was his commissioner. 
 And sometimes at night, alone... 
 I find myself left with an inescapable truth: my son was killed on my watch. 
 (cell phone rings) 
 Francis, you can't think like... 
 (house phone ringing) 
 What's up? 
 Hello? What? 
 All right, I'll tell him. 
 When did this call come in? 
 Tell my detail I'm going to want to stop there on the way in. 
 (phone beeps) 
 That was Danny. 
 (sighs) 
 (people chattering) 
 FRANK: As you were. 
 Frank, is it true about the Clearys? 
 We'll let you know, Barbara. 
 Please stand back. 
 Pop. 
 I understand. 
 You go ahead, Francis. 
 Commissioner. Sir. 
 Danny. 
 I was on my way into work. 
 Had to ask twice when they said the address. 
 Wouldn't sink in. 
 Different if it's someone you know. 
 Yeah. 
 Chief of D's thought you'd have the advantage, this being your home turf. 
 Okay. 
 FRANK: Him first, then her. 
 Yeah. Maid came in this morning to work and found them like this. 
 She ran across the street. Fitzgeralds called 911. 
 Forced entry? Robbery? Doesn't look like it. 
 M.E. puts it sometime last night. 
 He's asleep in front of the TV, she comes down... 
 Killing was done quick. 
 Eunice... has defensive wounds. 
 (rubber gloves snap) 
 I got to tell you, I don't want to think what I'm thinking, Dad. 
 Sir? The daughter just arrived. 
 HENRY: Easy, easy. Annie. 
 You can't go in there. Nobody can. 
 Please... 
 Please. Danny, Mr. Reagan, what's going on? 
 Mrs. Fitzgerald said something happened to Mom and Dad. 
 I'm sorry, Annie. What do you mean? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Ann! Al. 
 What's happening? What's going on? 
 It's Mom and Dad. What? Are they all right? 
 Are they inside? 
 You can't go inside, Al. 
 It's a crime scene. 
 Crime scene? 
 AL: Please, Mr. Reagan, just tell me. 
 Danny... 
 They were attacked last night and found this morning. 
 That's all we can say. 
 (sobs) 
 What happened? 
 We can't say. 
 Danny... please. 
 This is  me. 
 He'd say that to anyone, Al. 
 It's an ongoing investigation. 
 Where's our brother? 
 Where's Ronnie? 
 (Frank sighs) 
 He's not here. 
 AL: Danny, I knew something was going to happen. 
 Ever since they let Ronnie move back in. 
 We can't jump to conclusions, Al. 
 If it's not true, Ann, where is he? 
 Listen, we called the warehouse where Ronnie works. 
 He didn't show up for work this morning. 
 Do you have any idea where he might have gone? 
 A friend's house, a girlfriend? 
 Friends? 
 Danny... this is Ronnie we're talking about. 
 What friends he hasn't stolen from, he cut off years ago. 
 The only friend who stood by him was his sponsor. 
 (sighs) I only know his first name, but, uh, Ronnie was going to meetings down at the Methodist Church, on Grove. 
 Do you know when the last time you saw your parents, or spoke to them last? 
 Yesterday. 
 I stopped by on my way home from work. 
 I talk to my mom every day. 
 She seemed fine. 
 Dad left the dealership same as always, around 6:00. 
 And where were you last night, Al? 
 What? 
 Come on, Al. I got to ask the questions, all right? 
 Yeah, uh... I was home. 
 You were with Sharon and the kids? 
 They're in Florida. Her father's sick. 
 Okay, and where were you last night, Ann? 
 I was home. Can anybody verify that for you? 
 Um, the doorman. 
 AL: What happens now? 
 I mean, when do we get to see them? 
 I have to see them, Danny. 
 One of you are going to have to come down to the morgue and identify the bodies. 
 I can't believe this. 
 This can't be happening. I hope that you find my brother before I do. 
 Me, too. 
 JACKIE:  You want to bring me up to speed? 
 Yeah. Take a look for yourself. 
 All right. So... 
 So... it's a lot harder when you know the people, huh? 
 Yeah, that's what my old man always said. 
 Got a canine unit out looking for the murder weapon. There's a, uh, empty slot in the kitchen knife rack that's consistent with the size of the stab wounds. 
 Pretty distinct footprints through the blood, here. 
 DANNY: Yep. Made by a one person. 
 Hey, Jackie. Hey. 
 Just talked to Dad. 
 You really think Ronnie did this? 
 Well, he's definitely a person of interest. 
 Have a seat. 
 We're looking at anybody who had motive or access to the house, which would be the maid, relatives, Mr. Cleary's employees. 
 But I got to tell you, Mrs. Fitzgerald does put Ronnie at the house last night. 
 She said she saw him when she was walking the dog and he was coming home. 
 There's always been trouble there, but this? 
 What kind of trouble? Mr. Cleary rode those kids something terrible. 
 Mostly the boys, and mostly Ronnie. 
 Al ended up working for him at the car dealership. 
 Yeah, but Al was always more resilient. 
 Ronnie's... sensitive. 
 Mr. Cleary called Ronnie "cellar boy." 
 I mean, he thought it was funny. 
 Ronnie used to cringe at that. 
 What's "cellar boy"? 
 He moved into the basement when he was 14. 
 I don't know what came first, him moving down to the basement or did he move down to the basement to drink and smoke pot. 
 Where's the mother in all of this? 
 Rose-colored glasses, I guess. 
 Yep, they had some knock-down-drag-outs over there, let me tell you. 
 And they just had one last year-- 
 a... a sector car responded to a 52. 
 Ronnie and Mr. Cleary going at it again. 
 35-year-old living at home? 
 What's that all about? ERIN: You name it. 
 Bipolar, using. He'd move out, switch states, switch jobs, get in trouble, move back in, get cleaned up. 
 Some clean up. 
 You have any idea where he is? 
 No. 
 We've got a FINEST message out on his car, and his AA sponsor said if he hears from Ronnie, he'll give us a call. 
 Poor Ronnie. 
 Poor Ronnie? 
 Take a look at these photos-- poor Ronnie. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Cleary at the crime scene. 
 Nice, huh? 
 MALEVSKY: Reagan. Hey! 
 Quite the early bird. 
 Uh, Sergeant Renzulli's good work ethic is wearing off on me. 
 Ah, your brother Joe's car. 
 And now it's yours. 
 What brings you down here, Detective Malevsky? 
 Why do you ask? 
 No reason. "No reason." 
 There's an answer for the ages. 
 Be safe. 
 Hey, Sergeant. Beach boy. 
 What, do you got a tan or something? Huh? 
 It's 55 degrees and you're, uh, laying out? 
 Might be how you spent your day off, Sarge, but... 
 I was working on my car. 
 The Chevelle? 
 Yeah. Ooh... 
 Don't make me drool. 
 Where's my gun? 
 Huh? My service weapon. 
 I always keep it here on the top shelf. 
 It's gone. 
 You sure you didn't take it home? 
 I can't tell you how many times... 
 No, I'm sure. 
 I-I never take my service weapon home. 
 I swap it out with my off-duty... after every tour. Probably a prank one of the other guys in the precinct's pulling on you. 
 You tick anybody off? Besides me, of course. 
 No. Only thing is... 
 I wouldn't steal your gun, I would steal your car. 
 Listen to me. 
 Hey! Take everything out of the locker and go through the bag again. 
 Then go back home and go over every square inch of it for that weapon before you report it to the C.O. 
 All right. 
 'Cause then it becomes official and you're back under IA investigation. 
 IA? Again? Oh, yeah. 
 Losing your gun: that is not nothing, kid. 
 Sarge, I just saw Sonny Malevsky out front. 
 Was he... was he back here? 
 In here? No. 
 He was... at the front desk schmoozing with the guys when I came in. 
 Why? 
 No reason. But didn't you say you could get past these locks with a... a pair of scissors, a pencil and a soda can? 
 You think he stole your gun? 
 No, I... 
 Never mind. I, uh... 
 I don't know why I said that. 
 The mayor, sir. 
 I asked you to cut ten percent from your budget. 
 You missed by a mile. 
 I cut everything I could without crippling this department. 
 Well, then your department is frozen. 
 And we'll postpone your June Academy class. 
 If we don't bring those cops on line, we will be reduced to 1992 levels. 
 There's no money, Frank. 
 I am not raising taxes because of you. 
 In an election year. 
 In any year! 
 And every department shares the pain here. 
 I will not police this city with those kind of reductions of force. 
 And nobody, including you, will want the kind of pain it brings. 
 Now, is that a threat, Frank? 
 The threat here is to the citizens who elected you, and the $30 billion tourist industry we all depend on. 
 Give me a break, okay? 
 And the way you injected racism into that tourist shooting-- it-it... 
 Oh, race was already driving the story. 
 I just said it out loud. 
 You're not my Chamber of Commerce. 
 Just stick to what you know. 
 What I know is, you cannot cut this force any further. 
 No, you listen to me. 
 I am going to the City Council with my budget, with our Commissioners of Fire, Sanitation, Transportation-- 
 all who have been far more cooperative-- 
 and with you, standing alongside me. 
 And if you try to make me look bad, you'll be bringing a knife to a gunfight. 
 I promise you. 
 (door opens and closes) 
 All right, well, there's plenty of motive here. 
 I mean, there's a giant insurance policy, and the house. 
 Yeah, but Ronnie's not the only one. 
 I mean, all three of these kids stand to inherit. 
 All right, so Ann Cleary's doorman-- 
 he confirmed the alibi? 
 Yeah. She came home as per usual, though that doesn't mean she might not've left later, so we'll check ARGUS for video footage. 
 What about Al Cleary? 
 Al Cleary says he was home alone. 
 Gotta try to find something to corroborate that. 
 About Al-- the car dealership was failing. 
 Two salesmen were let go in the past couple months. 
 All right, let's make sure we talk to those two. What else? 
 So the father's pouring all of his personal money into keeping the business afloat, and he's taking out of the inheritance. 
 Al can't be too happy about that. 
 Okay, but money problems. 
 I mean, the neighbor told me that old man Cleary had just booked a round-the-world cruise trip for, uh, him and the wife, That their anniversary was coming up, and the ticket cost somewhere in the ballpark of $100,000. 
 Well, he may have booked that, but he hasn't started payment on that yet. 
 (phone rings) 
 Reagan. 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah. 
 Curatola. 
 You got caller ID on that? 
 Great. Yeah, we're on our way. Uh-huh. 
 Okay, got it. 
 Get your hat and coat. 
 That was Ronnie's AA sponsor. 
 He says Ronnie called him from the Rest-Well Motel. 
 He sounds suicidal. 
 Well, FINEST message paid off, too. 
 Patrol spotted Cleary's car in the parking lot of guess where? 
 Rest-Well Motel. All right. 
 This is Detective Reagan. 
 I need a ESU and a patrol to 85 us forthwith at the Rest-Well Motel in Sunset Park. 
 We got an emotionally disturbed homicide suspect. 
 Go on! Go on, shoot me, you sons of bitches! 
 Just put down the axe. We can talk about this. 
 Nobody wants to hurt you. 
 I don't want to talk, okay?! 
 I don't want to talk! You come up and get me! 
 Cleary, please, come on now. 
 Come on. Come on! 
 RONNIE: Come on! 
 (Ronnie and officer shouting) 
 Go on, shoot! 
 Okay, what do we got? 
 He was coming back with take-out. He's hyped up. 
 He smashed the firebox to get an axe. 
 All right. Probably trying to commit suicide by cop. 
 I know this guy, I can get close to him. 
 All right? I'm going to take over. RONNIE: Do it! Do it! 
 Okay, yeah. Let me borrow this, all right? 
 RONNIE: Come on, do it! 
 Shoot me! 
 Hey, Ronnie! 
 Oh. 
 It's me! It's Danny Reagan! You remember? 
 Yeah, I remember you, Danny. Get out of here! 
 Listen, I'm just gonna come talk to you, all right? 
 I don't want to talk to you, Danny! 
 Stay calm, and we'll discuss it, me and you, okay? 
 I don't want to talk, Danny! 
 No, no, look. Come on, no guns, nothing. 
 Just me and you, all right? 
 Don't do nothing stupid! 
 Don't come any closer! You get back! 
 Stay where you are, you son of a bitch! 
 (sobs): Stay where you are! Don't come any closer to me! 
 Ronnie. Ronnie! 
 (Ronnie yelling) 
 DANNY: Don't shoot! Don't shoot! 
 Hold it! Hold it, hold it! Don't shoot! 
 Hold it, hold it, Ronnie, listen to me. 
 Come on, let's talk. 
 Me and you now, all right? Like when we were kids. 
 Friends, all right? No. No. No. No. 
 Come on, you can trust me, Ronnie. Come on. 
 I don't want to talk, Danny, please. 
 Please, just let them kill me. Please. 
 I can't let them shoot you, Ronnie, all right? 
 We're just gonna talk, me and you, all right? 
 You're ruining everything, Danny! 
 Ronnie... 
 You're ruining it! 
 (yelling) 
 (clicking) 
 Damn it! 
 OFFICER: Suspect's down. 
 This is stupid, Ronnie. 
 OFFICER: We're all clear! 
 You want anything, Ronnie? 
 Some water? Did you eat anything? 
 Water maybe. 
 They gave me some crackers after the psych exam. 
 That and a clonazepam. Knock it off. 
 This isn't some drug possession or petty larceny case, Ronnie. 
 It's a double homicide. 
 You already told me that. 
 Think you could lose these cuffs, Danny? 
 Nah, I can't do that, Ronnie. 
 Now let's go over this one more time, okay? 
 Two people-- your mother and father-- 
 were murdered ten feet above your head, and you didn't hear anything? 
 You don't remember anything? 
 I got up that morning to go to work. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I went upstairs to get some breakfast and... 
 I saw them like that. 
 Right. 
 And what did you do? 
 Right. 
 You ran away. 
 That's your parents, Ronnie. If you didn't kill them, then why didn't you call 911? 
 I didn't want to go to jail. 
 Then why'd you kill them? 
 I didn't kill them. 
 What happened, Ronnie? 
 You and your old man get into it again, is that it? 
 Huh? He found out you were using again? 
 No. 
 See, now I know you're lying to me, Ronnie. 
 Now I know. 
 You know why? 
 'Cause we found the weed, and we found the prescription vial, and we found a half-drunk bottle of vodka under your bed. 
 I'm not using heroin. 
 What'd you do, Ronnie? What'd you do? 
 You get all juiced up and pass out and sleep right through your parents' murder? Is that what you're telling me? 
 Was it one of your blackouts, Ronnie? 
 Stop it. Stop what? 
 I'm not going to stop a damn thing until I find out who killed Kevin and Eunice Cleary. 
 You follow me? 
 Why didn't you just let me die? 
 Why didn't you just let them shoot me, Danny? 
 All right, Ronnie, all right. Let's say it wasn't you, then. 
 Who did it? 
 Huh? Who did it if it wasn't you? 
 I don't know. Some guy my old man sold a lemon to? 
 You knew him, Danny. 
 Outside of the house he was Mr. Popularity, hail-fellow-well-met. 
 Inside of the house, a real son of a bitch. 
 Reagan, talk to you? 
 (quietly): Yeah. 
 Sit tight. 
 Canine picked up a scent on these and found them in a trash can in a corner of a park nearby. 
 All right. 
 
 
 
 DANNY: These look familiar, Ronnie? 
 No. Well, they're yours. 
 And they're going down to the lab, and they're gonna type the blood in the treads to your mom. 
 And then they're gonna match the wear in the treads to the footprints found in the blood. 
 Isn't that right, Ronnie? 
 (stiffled sobs) 
 Get him down to Central Booking. 
 (sobbing): No. Oh, no. No... 
 No. I... please, Danny, don't. 
 Get out. Get out. 
 Danny! 
 There we go. All right. Thanks. 
 There you go. 
 We need to talk, Reagan. 
 You know, I've been on the job 20 years. 
 I've seen everything. 
 And I got a sixth sense when someone's trying to BS me. 
 First, I catch you looking into this Lydia Gonsalves IAB file, now this Sonny Malevsky thing. I told you, if I can't trust you, how am I going to ride with you? 
 That works both ways, kid. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Huh? 
 Did you ever... did you ever hear of the Blue Templar? 
 That? Uh-uh. 
 Not in a thousand years. Why? 
 What do you know about them? 
 That the world changed. 
 We got a more professional police force now. 
 No more cowboy posses. 
 You still didn't tell me why. 
 I can't tell you that. 
 You can't or you won't? 
 You said we gotta... we gotta trust each other, Sarge. 
 I gotta ask you to trust me on this one. 
 You got five? 
 Speech for Knights of Columbus Monday for you to vet, in case you have your usual litany of irritating notes. 
 Garrett, I'm in no mood. 
 The budget? 
 The mayor's insisting I publicly endorse his budget cuts. 
 Times are tough. 
 The practical is sometimes prudent. 
 You mean the political. 
 Of course I do. 
 I cannot run this department with a thousand fewer people. 
 And I can't prove it unless the crime rate goes up, at which point it'll be too late. So, Garrett... how could we get out in front of it? 
 Power of the press? 
 You tell me. 
 Headline: Mayor to NYPD-- Drop Dead? 
 Maybe something like that. 
 You do understand what you're proposing here. 
 I'm not proposing anything. 
 As a matter of fact, I can't even remember this conversation. 
 Exactly. 
 Ray Curston at the paper? 
 I can't hear you. 
 (buzzer sounds) 
 Come on. 
 Aw, man. What's she doing here? 
 She wanted to talk to you. 
 Oh, Ronnie. 
 You broke my heart when I was 15. 
 But what didn't, huh? 
 All right, I'm gonna get him started. 
 So what happened down there? 
 I mean, the more we know, the more we can help you. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no! No! 
 I am not going to tell the Assistant District Attorney anything, okay? 
 I may be out of my mind, but I ain't stupid. 
 Could've fooled me. 
 So what do you want? Hmm? 
 Here I am. 
 I'm a curiosity to you? Huh? 
 You don't deal with enough scum in your line of work? 
 Hey. Knock it off. Hey, big brother. 
 I just wanted to tell you that I would try to get you the best Legal Aid Attorney there is. 
 Please try to cooperate with them. 
 Screw it. I don't care. 
 Really? Is that why you're on the verge of tears? 
 It's just the clonazepam kicking in. 
 All right. You ready? 
 Yeah, let's get him searched. 
 DANNY: See you, sis. 
 Sweetheart. Hi. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Meeting ran over? 
 (sighs) 
 And over. 
 I got beat up pretty good. Yeah? 
 Who won? 
 We're in the middle rounds. 
 Thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 So how are you doing? 
 Fine. 
 Well, you probably talked to Ronnie Cleary by now. 
 Saw him at Central Booking. 
 Yeah, well, that couldn't have been easy. 
 Got me thinking about Joe. 
 That was a big part of your childhood, my three oldest and the Cleary kids. 
 Yeah. Ronnie, Joe and I were like the Three Musketeers. 
 I was such a tomboy then. 
 You had a pretty good jump shot. 
 He was my first kiss. 
 That I didn't know. 
 (chuckles) 
 There's a lot you don't know, Dad. 
 I think Joe felt he abandoned Ronnie. 
 Yeah, we used to talk about that. 
 Ronnie dove into that half-filled swimming pool drunk, broke his nose. 
 That was the last straw for Joe. 
 You think we'll ever stop missing him? 
 Yolanda, I got your message. 
 Thanks for meeting me. 
 I knew Detective Gonsalves had a twin, but you do, you look exactly like her. 
 Must be like seeing a ghost. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 How is Lydia's daughter? 
 She misses her mom, but she's adjusting. 
 We're doing okay. 
 The reason I wanted to see you, Lydia left a package for me with her things. 
 There were insurance issues because of the suicide, and her estate only recently became available to me. 
 She said that if anything happened to her that I should give you this. 
 And it happened. 
 Thanks. 
 I don't think your sister's death was a suicide. 
 I never did either. 
 She loved her little girl... and all of us. 
 I'm gonna make it right. 
 Maybe what's in there will help. 
 First three ribs, Dad, prime aged. 
 Silvano cut it special for you. 
 And Linda wants me to take it out of the fridge before church tomorrow, I know. 
 Yep. 
 You want something to eat? 
 Uh, nah, sugar's good for me. 
 It looks bad for Ronnie Cleary. 
 Well, we got good alibis on everybody. 
 I mean, even Ann Cleary's sometimes boyfriend has been surfing in Costa Rica for the past month. 
 Never married, never really blossomed, Ann Cleary. 
 Nobody was ever good enough for their baby. 
 They always kept her in Cadillacs and pocket change. 
 So, what do you got? 
 Well, we got enough to make an arrest. 
 What does Erin say? 
 Erin says we probably don't have enough to get a jury to convict-- we gotta find the murder weapon. 
 Well, if it was the kitchen knife, he lives there. 
 His DNA's gonna be all over it. 
 Yeah, same as everything at the crime scene. 
 Just... 
 What? 
 Well, we found the sneakers in the opposite direction of the motel where we found Ronnie. 
 So, okay, maybe he didn't know where he was going, maybe he was running around in circles. Who knows? 
 But it just seems like we would have found the knife where we found the sneakers. 
 And what else? 
 Well, there's Mrs. Cleary. 
 I mean, there's signs of a struggle, but she's got no genetic material under her fingernails except for latex. 
 The killer used gloves. 
 Right. Which explains why Ronnie had no scratches or wounds on his hands from the struggle. 
 Which would mean it wasn't one of his alcoholic rages-- he planned it. 
 Right. 
 Is that what's bothering you? 
 Well, I mean, it would be the first time in his life that Ronnie Cleary planned anything, Dad. 
 Hey, I thought you were a customer. 
 Ah... 
 You could use a new car there, Danny. 
 Think so, huh? Yeah. 
 Hey, I can offer you .9 financing. 
 Basically, you're paying for the paperwork. 
 Ah, my wife likes that one. 
 (chuckles) 
 Look, I just came by to ask you a few questions, you know, dot a few I's, cross a few T's. 
 What happened to the whiskey, beer chaser Danny Reagan of old? 
 Yeah. Come on. 
 Nah, it's just Detective Reagan now. 
 Yeah. 
 What can I do for you, Detective? 
 Well, I've been thinking about this thing, the murders. 
 They were really, really well thought out. 
 It just doesn't seem like Ronnie, you know? 
 You're thinking about the Ronnie that you knew. 
 The heroin-addict version our family's been having to deal with, he is a master of manipulation and lies. 
 He played my parents. 
 He bled them dry with those stints in the fancy rehab. 
 That's a very well-thought-out answer, Al. 
 What are you trying to do, Danny? 
 My job. 
 You don't think this has been hard enough? 
 Why don't you try thinking about Ronnie? 
 At least now he'll get the help that he needs. 
 They'll make sure he stays on his meds, right? 
 Yeah, well, I just keep thinking about you. 
 A 42-year-old guy working under his old man's thumb day after day, year after year? 
 Couldn't be easy. 
 You should know. 
 I'm not the only one taking orders from my old man around here. Right? 
 (knocking on door) 
 Have a seat. 
 Didn't know you guys worked on Saturday. 
 Thought you were nine-to-fivers. 
 I'm going on vacation next week, I'm trying to clear my schedule. 
 This new business with the missing gun deserves immediate attention. 
 My gun was taken from my locker. 
 Or you sold it to somebody. 
 I didn't sell it to anybody. Someone stole it. 
 A new patrol officer makes $46,000 a year. 
 You have $85,000-worth of student loan debt, Harvard. 
 Maybe you figured out a way to make some extra cash. 
 You have proof that I sold it, or is that just an accusation? 
 Are you challenging me, Reagan? 
 No, sir. 
 Whether you lost it or sold it, that gun is missing, and it could very easily fall into the wrong hands. 
 Show up in a crime, a murder. 
 And that'll be a really bad problem for you. 
 A real career changer. 
 You understand? 
 Yes, I think I do. 
 Hopefully, you find that gun, Reagan. 
 If not, we will launch a full-blown investigation. 
 Until then, be advised we'll be keeping a close eye on you. 
 You can go. 
 (phone rings) 
 Yeah? 
 He just left. 
 So what do you think? 
 I think he's a liability. 
 Okay. 
 Done just right, Pop. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And you're not an easy sell. 
 You've been talking to the mayor? 
 How's that going, Dad? 
 Well, they've both drawn their lines in the sand, but they're worlds apart. 
 Been a lot of rumbling from the rank and file about reduction of force. 
 Can we talk about something that doesn't ruin my appetite? 
 How about the elephant that's in the room? 
 Terrible thing, that. 
 I saw Ann Cleary's car in the driveway on the way up. 
 Looks like she's packing everything. 
 That's been a unhappy house for a long time. 
 Whose house are you talking about-- cellar boy? 
 Jack. 
 What? I heard you and Mom talking about him. 
 Danny was telling me about the father and the kids, you know, about Ronnie. 
 And while it might sound funny, the cellar boy thing is not funny, Jack. 
 Well, why not? 
 Dads shouldn't call their kids names. 
 It belittles them. 
 Belittled? 
 Made them feel bad. 
 That's right. It makes them feel bad about themselves and makes them feel small. 
 That's what bullies do. 
 Just like a bully. 
 HENRY: So now it's the father's fault somehow? 
 The parents made him do it? 
 Do what? 
 Would you just focus on your potatoes, please? 
 ERIN: Ronnie's got a dual diagnosis, Grandpa. 
 I mean, with a good lawyer and sympathetic judge, he'll be put in an appropriate facility. 
 Or maybe a sympathetic ADA. 
 HENRY: He wasn't mental enough not to run. 
 In my book, that's an admission of guilt and sanity. 
 Yep. You know, you might be a hard-ass, Grandpa, but I'm in lockstep with you on this one. 
 Yeah, boys, don't call anyone names, but feel free to swear at the table. 
 His dad couldn't accept the fact that his kid was ill. 
 That was a big part of the problem over there. 
 Like I said, unhappy house. 
 Happy families are alike. 
 Unhappy families are unhappy in their own way. 
 Who said that? 
 Other than me? Tolstoy. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, I'm glad that I was born into this family. 
 Luck of the draw, sweetie. 
 DANNY: Hear, hear. 
 HENRY: Luck and looking out for each other. 
 You taking care of my car? 
 I thought it was my car. 
 It is. 
 They don't build 'em like this anymore. 
 It's... not a computer anywhere. 
 It's pure mechanics. 
 You didn't say much in there. 
 I was younger than everybody else. 
 I didn't really know that family. 
 You okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm worried about you. 
 Since when? 
 Probably ever since you put on the uniform. 
 You sorry about the choice you made? 
 ERIN: Hey, Dad, Mom's tulips are looking great. 
 Grandpa's really taking good care of them. 
 I'm gonna get going. 
 You sure you don't want to stick around? 
 No, I got a company reunion; my probationary graduation party, so... 
 Careful. I ended up on my hands and knees behind a Dumpster on my night. 
 Thanks for the visual. 
 See you guys. 
 We're making a condolence call to Ann Cleary. 
 Yeah, "slash" reinterview. 
 Erin's my beard. 
 You want to come? 
 (engine starting) 
 Not my job. 
 Well, she's definitely packing up. 
 Hi, Annie. 
 Erin. Hi. 
 So... heard what you said to my brother. 
 That really upset him. 
 Yeah. 
 Danny wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't cover every angle. 
 DANNY: So you think this idea that Ronnie didn't do it is just a crazy thought, huh? 
 I mean, you know Al and Ronnie hated each other. 
 I mean, Al was embarrassed by Ronnie. 
 Got his teeth knocked out by Ronnie. 
 You know all the juicy details about the Clearys, huh? 
 The famous Reagan Sunday dinner. 
 I bet we were the topic of conversation. 
 Ronnie always used to rub it into my folks-- 
 why can't we be more like the Reagans? 
 That's not fair, Annie. 
 Well, you should understand what it feels like, Erin. 
 I mean, this divorce can't be easy for you. 
 And to think that your misery is the... the fodder for other people's gossip, that hurts, right? 
 Yeah, it does. 
 Well, I just... wanted you to know what it feels like. 
 (sighs) 
 Sorry. I've got work to do. 
 Annie, hold on a second. 
 Um, look, I'm sorry if I upset you. 
 The good news is, we found the knife. 
 Yeah. 
 We're expecting the lab results back tomorrow. 
 Probably won't find much 'cause we're pretty sure the killer wore gloves, but, you know, maybe we'll get lucky. 
 Wow. Poor Ronnie. 
 Hey. 
 You found the murder weapon? 
 No. Just shaking the tree to see if anything falls out. 
 Is that why you subpoenaed all the phone calls for her and Al? 
 If I'm right, she's probably calling Al right now. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 (engine starting) 
 (horn honking) 
 (tires squealing) 
 (horn honking) 
 (horn honking) 
 (tires squealing) 
 (panting) 
 JACKIE: Just like you thought, Reagan, soon as you leave the house, sister called her brother. 
 Yep, and found out he was here. 
 Though it's funny they were smart enough not to, uh, speak over the phone just in case we were tapped in. 
 JACKIE: We wait. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 It's Sunday night, Reagan. 
 I'm missing my Chinese spareribs and martinis. 
 Gin and grease-- it's a food group, you know. 
 This works out, I'll treat you to Peter Luger's. 
 Well, well, well. 
 Ooh. I'm getting a T-bone, medium rare. 
 DANNY: Looks like they're having a little difference of opinion. 
 (no audio) 
 (engine starting) 
 AL: What did I tell you? Drop the knife. 
 You stupid... 
 Shut up. You shut up. 
 Drop the knife right now! 
 AL: Damn it, Ann! You idiot! 
 (knife clatters) 
 BAKER:  Mounted Unit graduation  has been moved to 1500. 
 Bronx DA has called twice already. 
 Screw you, Frank. 
 "Mayor's Draconian budget cuts 
 "deny training to New York City's best and brightest future police officers." 
 Blah, blah, blah. 
 Oh, and look at the pictures-- women and... and ethnics and veterans. 
 Yeah, I-I'm like Scrooge and the Grinch rolled into one. 
 You screwed me. 
 Screw you. 
 You think I had something to do with that? 
 Of course, you did! 
 No, sir. 
 Well, how did they get onto it? 
 How did they get in contact with those cadets? 
 Well, last time I checked, we live in a democracy, and I do not run a secret police. 
 If I can't deliver a balanced budget, the State takes over. 
 Now, do you have any idea what those hillbillies upstate will do to your beloved department if they get control of our finances? 
 Boy. What are you going to do? 
 I'm going to find the money somewhere. 
 But be forewarned, you and your plausible deniability-- 
 I mean, it ain't going to fly no more. 
 (sighs) 
 Mayor's a little cranky. 
 He's sensitive about an article in this morning's paper. 
 I'll be at my desk. 
 He ought to be thanking you. 
 Oh, I don't think we're in any danger of that. 
 Well, someday he's going to wake up and realize just how lucky he is to have you. 
 Or that. 
 The, uh, Knights of Columbus speech-- 
 I counted 23 metaphors in five pages. 
 Got to be a personal worst. 
 I'll polish it before breakfast. 
 I'm the police commissioner, not a politician. 
 Don't imagine swelling music when you write for me. 
 Just sirens and gunfire? 
 Just... plain and honest. 
 Erin. 
 Ronnie. Hi. 
 I'm so happy. 
 I mean, I'm sad about your parents, but I'm glad you're not taking the fall for it. 
 It's really hard to wrap my head around it. 
 Yeah. Um, have a seat. 
 Ann confessed to the whole thing. 
 It was Al's idea. 
 I guess the money your parents were going to spend on that trip was a tipping point for him. 
 I just keep thinking about that night. 
 It's just a blank. 
 Well, Ann laced your grapefruit juice with sleeping pills. 
 She knew you were on a greyhound bender. 
 Al wore your shoes through their blood. 
 How could he do that to me? 
 To them? 
 I don't know, Ronnie. 
 They were going to plant the knife and your shirt, soaked in your parents' blood, near your motel to seal your fate. 
 (sighs) 
 How could they be so cold-blooded? 
 I guess the short version is, they felt cheated. 
 The long version-- you tell me. 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 What are you going to do now? 
 Stay clean? 
 I'm not looking for a right or wrong answer, Ronnie. 
 Oh. 
 I can't live in that house anymore. 
 I'm rich, I guess, sort of. 
 What do you think I should do? 
 You know I'm single. 
 And rich. 
 (laughs) 
 I mentioned that. 
 That's very sweet, Ronnie. 
 I think I'll go down to Florida. 
 I got a kid down there somewhere. 
 Will you stay in touch? 
 Definitely. 
 Erin, I hope you know how lucky you are. 
 I do. 
 What's going on, kid? 
 (sighs) 
 Something you should hear. 
 JOE (recorded): I'm getting close, but the Templar may have made me. 
 That's Joe. 
 The night he was killed. 
 He was working with the FBI, investigating the Blue Templar. 
 What? 
 I should have told you a long time ago, Danny. 
 Does Dad know? 
 No.
