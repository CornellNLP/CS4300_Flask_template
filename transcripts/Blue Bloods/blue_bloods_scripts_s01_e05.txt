 (sirens wailing) 
 (tires screeching) 
 (whispering): Okay, on site. We're going in. 
 NYPD! Freeze! 
 Clear! 
 On the floor! 
 On the floor now! Don't move! 
 OFFICER: At the rear-- clear! 
 Don't move. 
 Hello? 
 In the kitchen! 
 You ready? Where's Dad? 
 On the phone somewhere. 
 Dad! 
 I don't why you people are dragging me to this handball tourney anyway. 
 What do you mean? You love handball. 
 I loved  playing  handball. 
 Got to take a rain check. 
 Ah. 
 Why? What's the matter? 
 Ah, the information's still coming in. 
 DANNY: Dad, the Batmobile just showed up! 
 Yeah, I know. Next time, Pop. 
 Have fun, sweetheart. Where you going? 
 Dad, don't forget about your grandson's birthday tonight. 
 Never missed one yet. 
 Something going on? 
 Apparently. 
 HENRY: You're always late. If you can be consistently ten minutes late, why can't you consistently be on time? 
 (phone rings) 
 Why are you getting on my case, Grandpa? 
 I just worked till 0400 this morning. 
 Reagan. We got to get going if I'm gonna get a bleacher seat out of the sun. 
 All right, let's go. 
 I got to go. 
 What? You, too? 
 I got a ten-two call. I got to get back to work. 
 HENRY: I got ten tuna sandwiches. 
 What are you gonna eat? 
 (laughs) 
 (clears throat) 
 You'd think we'd get used to it. 
 Yeah. I'm retired. 
 (siren wailing) 
 HOGAN:  Counterterrorism has a 23-year-old Muslim-American  in custody in his apartment in Queens. 
 Steven Hass, recently adopted the name Khalid Hassan. 
 Raid was triggered by interception of an e-mail to al Qaeda leaders this morning at 0600. 
 That's the transcription from Arabic. 
 "Today no rest for oppressors in New York City." 
 "In area of fireball slaughters crusader enemies..." 
 Instructions for a car bomb were found on his computer. 
 Precursor chemicals, tools, wires but no device. 
 No car. 
 No vehicles registered in either name at this time, but neighbors reported seeing him in an older dark-colored SUV. 
 What's the target? 
 No specific target yet, but they did manage to retrieve a computer map to the 59th Street Bridge. 
 Task force is already shutting it down. 
 Double up on checkpoints at all bridges and tunnels into and out of Manhattan. 
 Got it. 
 It's not going to happen again. 
 Not today. 
 Not here. 
 An old dark SUV, huh? 
 Great. There's about 50 million of those in the city. 
 Tell me about it. 
 They know the target yet? 
 Somewhere in Manhattan. 
 You're kidding me. 
 Oh, man. 
 Linda's bringing the boys to Central Park Zoo for Jack's birthday at 3:30. 
 All right. Yeah. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hello? 
 Ah, shoot. 
 What's the matter, Mom? 
 Ah, my cell phone died. 
 I forgot to plug it in last night. 
 Can we get cotton candy? 
 We'll see. 
 We'll see like yes, or we'll see like no? 
 We'll see like we'll see. 
 I'm gonna beat you. 
 Oh, no, you're not. 
 (laughter) 
 DANNY:  Come on! 
 LINDA (recording) 
 This is Linda. 
 I can't take your call. Leave a message. 
 Hey, Linda, babe, it's me. 
 Listen, when you get this message, just-just turn around and take the boys home, okay? 
 All right, I can't really talk about it now, but just don't be in the city today, all right? 
 Call me as soon as you get this. 
 I love you, babe.

 HOGAN:  Chief Bell from Intelligence, 
 Pat Mills from Homeland Security-- 
 they're all setting up emergency operations here. 
 Got the MTA, electric company, Joint Task Force-- 
 everybody in the same place, so we're all up to speed and coordinated. 
 FBI is interviewing in the field along with our people. 
 Let's get at it. 
 Chief Bell. 
 BELL: Commissioner. 
 MILLS: Agent Mills, Homeland Security. 
 Our lead, right? 
 It is until I hear different. 
 We've got a description of the SUV on the air, 35,000 cops, on-duty and off, are on the hunt. 
 But there are thousands of these dark SUVs. 
 It'll take us hours to check every one. 
 We need to find who's driving. 
 Homeland Security is all over this, Commissioner. 
 We'll get you data on every breath Hassan has taken in the last 23 years. 
 Why am I just finding out about this guy today? 
 American citizen, American passport. 
 We know now that he was in Yemen 14 months ago. 
 For bomb training. 
 There was nothing to flag the visit. 
 Has Washington been briefed? 
 Anything we need. 
 We can use all the help D.C will give us. 
 Jim, how do we know the bomb's still in this SUV? 
 Hassan's diagram. 
 They built the bomb inside the car for maximum effect. 
 It's not a dirty bomb. 
 How do you know? 
 ESU found no traces of radiation in the residence or on the person. 
 So what kind of effect are we talking about? 
 Ten bags of fertilizer, two gallons of acetone peroxide, 50 pounds of four-inch nails. 
 If he used the full formula, it's a two-story firebomb with one-block blast radius. 
 Frags and shrapnel another half block. 
 Where are they keeping this guy? 
 Joint Task Force is moving him to Major Case. 
 Your son Danny had a prior contact with the perp, which we hope will help us get to him. 
 And I've also heard that his interrogation skills can be quite effective. 
 You could practically eat off the floor in this car, it's so clean. 
 This alert seems a lot more serious than that suspicious package call we got yesterday. 
 Since 9/11, we get threats pretty regular. 
 Usually turns out to be nothing. 
 We'll know it's a highly credible threat if we get another alert within the hour. 
 Know what I mean? 
 Hey. 
 Hot dog, 12 o'clock. 
 We just ate lunch. 
 Nah, suspicious hot dog. 
 Get serious. 
 Think I'm kidding? 
 The sandwich-wearing class is well-known to be problematic. 
 They hide all kinds of contraband up there. 
 Look at him. 
 He's getting nervous. 
 He doesn't look nervous. 
 Yes, he does. 
 Go question him. 
 But the bomb... 
 Another alert-- I told you-- 
 and it gets serious. 
 I'm not gonna question some poor guy wearing a hot dog costume. 
 See, that is key, kid. 
 Why else would someone take a humiliating job unless there's some upside to it? 
 Unemployment's near ten percent and rising. 
 Stop him, question him, frisk him. 
 Go ahead! 
 Isn't this an abuse of the policy? 
 He looks suspicious. 
 We have an obligation to check it out. 
 Don't we? Huh? 
 Come on. 
 Hey, do your job. 
 Come on! 
 Go get him. 
 What did I tell you? 
 Go ahead! 
 (grunting) 
 JAMIE: He's got a whole drugstore here. 
 MAN: Stop. Quit moving. 
 Let me go. Settle down. 
 Put your hands behind your back. 
 Come on, let me go. I didn't do anything. 
 Stop moving. You got any weapons? 
 No, I got no weapons. 
 Let me go! 
 Got anything else you're not supposed to have? No! 
 MAN: Come on, let me go. 
 JAMIE: Quit moving around. 
 Hey. 
 What did I tell you, huh? 
 Look at all this stuff. 
 Let's go. Get up, Mr. Wiener. Huh? 
 Look what we got here, huh? Settle down! 
 MAN: Let me go. I didn't do anything! 
 Just settle down. We caught you with a cache of illegal prescription drugs. 
 Hydrocodone, oxycodone... 
 I don't know where they came from. 
 The suit belongs to the restaurant. 
 Yeah, everybody's a comedian. 
 Should we get this thing off of him? 
 There should be a zipper there somewhere. 
 Yeah, use two sets of cuffs. 
 Isn't it bad enough I got to wear this clown suit? 
 Have a heart. 
 (PDA beeping) 
 Wait a second. 
 Hey, we got to book this dog fast, get back on the street. 
 Come on. Top priority. 
 Second alert in 30 minutes. Come on. 
 Get him in the car. 
 (recording): This is Linda. I can't take your call. 
 Leave a message. 
 Linda, you know, what's the point of having a cell phone if you're not gonna pick it up, babe? 
 Call me back. 
 AVA: Still no answer? 
 No. 
 You know, the zoo at Central Park on the weekend-- 
 it's, like, wall-to-wall babies and strollers. 
 Sound like a good American target to you? 
 Blow up a few families on a Saturday afternoon? 
 Go find them Reagan. Send them home. 
 Do what? Let everybody else's family get blown up? 
 Allright, this is him. 
 Ring any bells? 
 Yup. 
 Strong-arm robbery I worked a few years back in the East Village. 
 This guy got yoked for his sneakers, roughed up pretty good. 
 This kid's a terrorist threat now? 
 Was a scared little kid when I met him. 
 Until he went radical. 
 Second squad's chasing down some of his cousins on Long Island. 
 What else? 
 Field agents interviewed the parents. 
 Immigrated from Yemen 30 
 years ago, Westernized, estranged from their son. 
 They're blindsided by all this. 
 Where's Vitale? Can't wait to get my hands on this kid. 
 Hey, Central Park Station. 
 Yeah, look, I need you to page someone in the zoo-- 
 Linda Reagan. 
 No, Linda Reagan, in the zoo. 
 Thank you. Hey, look at this. 
 Take him to the back. 
 Put him in there. 
 Detective. 
 How you doing, Reagan? 
 Tough nut. 
 Yeah. Be fun to crack it. 
 Don't cross the line, Danny. 
 We need to make this case stick. 
 What line? 
 What is this? 
 Don't know. 
 Not usually a checkpoint here. 
 OFFICER: Yeah, can you step on out, please. 
 ERIN: Whatever it is, it must be why Dad and Danny had to leave. 
 Hmm. 
 I'll call my office, find out what's going on. 
 Nah, the D.A.'s office won't know anything yet. 
 It's a police matter; let them do their work. 
 (chuckles) 
 (indistinct chattering) 
 Got to say, it's good to be back here. 
 Where I spent a year's worth of my Saturdays. 
 (door opens) 
 Khalid, work with me. 
 You haven't hurt anybody yet. 
 His name's not Khalid. 
 It's Steve. 
 You tell him your name's Steve? 
 VITALE: If this bomb goes off, you're talking multiple homicides. 
 The Feds have the death penalty. 
 This guy? 
 He's not afraid of the death penalty. 
 Are you, Steve? 
 You're not afraid. 
 I mean, why else would he outsource the driving to someone else so they can get blown up? 
 Right, Steve? 
 Hmm? 
 Just tell us where it's headed and you won't have thrown your life away. 
 It's your life that's meaningless and corrupt. 
 If this goes down, there's no deal for you. 
 This is your one and only chance to do yourself some good. 
 I am doing good. 
 And I spit on your deal. 
 I want a lawyer. 
 Hey, your lawyer's on his way, okay? 
 But he's hit some delays because of all the checkpoints that we had to set up, thanks to you. 
 You remember me? 
 You remember me, don't you, Steve? 
 You do. 
 I can tell. 
 Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. 
 You just don't want to admit it though, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I know you don't want him to know. 
 How scared you were. 
 You're embarrassed about what happened. 
 But I remember. 
 You remember you came to see me two years ago? 
 You got robbed. 
 You came in and you cried and you cried and you cried like a little girl. 
 So, what, you a man now, hmm? 
 You're all radicalized, you're gonna get some payback. 
 Is that it, Steve? 
 You're corrupt. Yeah. 
 Your wife and kids are corrupt. 
 Hey, hey! You don't talk about my wife and kids! Reagan... 
 You don't mention my wife and kids! 
 You're a coward! 
 Reagan, enough, man. 
 You want to blow up my wife and kids? 
 Hey, can I get something to drink? 
 Yeah, I'll get you a drink. 
 Anything on the NSA feed? 
 Increased chatter, but nothing seems to relate. 
 Can you put up the original e-mail intercept? 
 I find the phrasing odd. 
 "In area fireball slaughters crusader enemies" 
 Yes. Hassan is a non-native Arabic speaker. 
 The Arabic word he used for "area" is "mintaqa," but... 
 He may have meant something else. 
 Probably. 
 I need to know exactly what he meant. 
 Looks like we have something here. 
 A live chat between servers in a café in Sana and a training camp in rural Yemen. 
 BELL: "Today New York feels suffering as our people do." 
 (From the café) 
 "Is it done yet?" 
 BELL: "Before the new day." 
 MILLS: Could mean we have until dawn there tomorrow before the bomber intends to detonate. 
 Or just as likely, midnight tonight Yemen time, which means we have until 5:00. 
 Less than six hours from now. 
 Boss, mayor's office is asking for a joint statement. 
 Tell them I recommend no public statement at this time. 
 Commissioner... 
 We don't have enough information to do anything but cause a panic. 
 Gridlocked streets, bridges and tunnels jammed, people trying to get out. 
 MILLS: There could be repercussions for withholding information. 
 I know that. You also understand that I'm going to have to brief D.C. about this. 
 I'm clear on that, too. 
 (siren chirps) 
 Change of plans. 
 We need to swing by Chelsea Piers. 
 They want all hands on deck at these checkpoints. 
 What about... 
 Yeah, yeah, what about me? 
 The wiener's going for a ride. Come on. 
 (siren wailing) 
 Okay, go. Go. 
 Can we work something out here? 
 You got a record of dealing, pal. 
 You're in hot water. 
 Get out the car, please. 
 You get it? 
 Hot water? 
 Steaming the sausage? 
 Huh? I get it. 
 (laughs) 
 Very, very funny. 
 I think it's very funny, personally. 
 (tires screeching) 
 RENZULLI:  Hey, that van is running the checkpoint. 
 (siren wailing) 
 Come on, chop-chop. 
 RENZULLI:  Whoa, whoa. 
 Stop! Stop! 
 (tires screeching) 
 Stay back! Show me your hands! 
 Stay back! Stay back! 
 Show me your hands! 
 RENZULLI: 12th Sergeant to Central. 
 Be advised we have a dark SUV at the corner of West 23rd and West Side Highway. 
 Requesting ESU and Bomb Squad forthwith. 
 Don't move! Keep your hands where we can see them! 
 Keep your hands where I can see them! 
 Keep your hands where I can see them! 
 Okay, okay, don't shoot, don't shoot. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Is there a bomb in the car? 
 What? 
 A bomb in the car. 
 Oh, my God, there's a bomb in the car?! 
 I don't know, is there?! 
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God, there's a bomb in the car?! 
 God, there's a bomb in the car! 
 Are you stoned? 
 Huh? 
 Okay, well, maybe a little bit. 
 Just a little, just a little high. 
 Unlock the car. 
 Get out of the car, you dopey knucklehead. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 What are you smoking, huh? 
 (panting) 
 Must be good. JAMIE: Central, 12 Sergeant Op. 
 Our SUV driver doesn't appear to be the suspect. 
 No further at this location. 
 He's not talking. 
 You know, let's get anything we can get on who's driving that bomb and where they're headed. 
 Over 700 stops so far. 
 It's gonna take us two days to go through everybody. Hey, you know what? 
 So let's focus on the Arabs, see if anyone's connected to Steven Hass from Queens. 
 Profiling. 
 Call it what you want. 
 Got to do it. 
 How many times you been stopped? 
 Not as many as my father. 
 Let's cross-check with airlines, see if anyone went to Yemen around the same time as Hass. 
 And see if anyone's a member of his mosque. 
 Vitale's still at it? 
 Yeah, he's got me on time-out. 
 Tell you what, hatred's done wonders for this kid. 
 He's manned up now. 
 If that's what you want to call it. 
 (sighs) 
 With this friggin' message. 
 (recording): It's Linda. I can't take your call. 
 Leave a message. Still no answer? 
 No. 
 Damn it. 
 (sighs): Ay-ay-ay. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Linda? 
 ERIN: No, it's me. Listen. 
 Grandpa didn't want me to bother you, but what is going on? 
 I'm looking at a pretty aggressive checkpoint here. 
 Are you working on a terrorist threat or something? 
 Yeah, credible threat, car bomb in Manhattan. 
 You guys still in Brooklyn? 
 Yeah. Wait. 
 Didn't Linda say she was going to the zoo today with the kids? 
 Yeah, and her phone keeps going straight to voice mail. 
 Damn battery's so old it won't hold a charge. 
 All right, Danny, I'll go and find them, okay? 
 No, you're not going anywhere. 
 Just stay in Brooklyn, okay? 
 Please. 
 
 
 
 You don't sound good. 
 I'm frustrated. 
 Pulled over every Arab in the freakin' state in an SUV; nothing's shaking out. 
 Why are you so sure he's Arab? 
 'Cause we have one in custody already. 
 From where? 
 Yemen by way of Queens. 
 Okay. 
 You know that terrorist profiles are changing. 
 I got several cases in the office right now... 
 You gonna start this again with the ACLU crap? 
 Okay, Danny, Danny, remember that white kid from California? Yeah. 
 Or Timothy McVeigh. 
 All right, there's an English language music video on the Internet right now recruiting American terrorists. 
 Okay, okay, I got it, I got it. 
 Okay? I got to go. 
 (phone beeps) 
 All right, you know what? 
 Start pulling all the stop and frisks we passed over earlier 
 'cause people were too white, too cuddly or whatever. 
 That you don't hear very often. 
 It's one of those days. 
 Wake up, O'Hanlon! Juice that sucker! 
 ERIN: Come on, kill shot! 
 Let's end this game! 
 O'Hanlon, you stink! 
 You stink! 
 Ah! I'm glad we came. 
 Me, too. 
 I, um, I like showing you off to the guys. 
 (both laugh) 
 I also like watching a good match. 
 Not as much as I liked playing it, but... 
 You'll get back out there. 
 My athletic days are over, I think. 
 Well, then who's going to teach Nicky how to play handball? 
 Nicky does not care about handball. 
 Neither did Danny. 
 He didn't? 
 No. 
 He just liked the time he spent with you. 
 He'd always come home retelling your stories. 
 I saw you on the phone. 
 So, uh, what'd you find out? 
 What's going on? 
 Car bomb threat in town. 
 Linda and the boys are there. 
 Danny can't get ahold of them. 
 When is this crap gonna stop? 
 In my day, it was simple. 
 H-bomb, mutual assured destruction, a standoff. 
 These guys-- they can't wait to go. 
 Tell me what your e-mail said. 
 Oh, man, you know what it says. 
 You got a translation right there. 
 Yeah, but it doesn't make any sense. 
 "No rest for the oppressors today in New York City." 
 That's right. 
 "No rest for the oppressors today in New York City." And? 
 I asked you for a drink of water. 
 You're not gonna die of thirst, Steve. 
 Other things, maybe. 
 Not that. 
 "No rest for the oppressors today in New York City." 
 We've been over this a thousand times. 
 Yeah, but there's more words here than that. 
 You don't know Arabic, do you? 
 (chuckles) 
 Yes, I do. 
 Yeah? 
 So, this one. 
 DANNY: Come on. You speak Arabic. 
 What kind of terrorist would you be if you didn't speak Arabic? 
 Spit it out. 
 Come on, Steve. 
 Come on. 
 "Crusader enemies"" 
 Mm-hmm? 
 This? 
 "Slaughter"" 
 Ah. 
 This? 
 "Fireball." 
 This one? 
 "Park." 
 "Park"? Hey. 
 Don't play me for a fool. 
 That word means, "area." 
 That word-- mintaqa-- 
 means "park." 
 It's a park. 
 What? No. 
 You just said it. 
 I never said "park"" Yes, you did. 
 You just said it. You're just trying to confuse me. I didn't say "park"" 
 No, you meant to write "park." 
 I didn't say park! But you wrote "area." 
 You meant "park"! I didn't say "park"! 
 I'm redeploying men to every park and playground in Manhattan. 
 That's more than a hundred locations. 
 It's a good lead. 
 Commissioner, mayor's on the way up. 
 Excuse me. 
 Took him a little longer than I expected. 
 I guess my point is that... if this bomb explodes and we haven't warned the public, or if the press gets out in front of us... 
 So wouldn't it be better to have every man and woman in this city on the lookout for this vehicle? 
 It would if we had the specifics on the SUV and the target. 
 Right now, we'd only be creating chaos. 
 I serve at your pleasure, sir, but we're just not there yet. 
 I appreciate that, okay? 
 So what happens if hundreds of New Yorkers get blown to bits, thousands maybe, and we didn't warn them? 
 You understand? 
 We didn't tell them to leave the parks. 
 I know the stakes, Mr. Mayor. 
 We will find this bomb, and we will disarm it. 
 All right. You got till 4:00, then I hold a press conference, and you'll be there. 
 Just a lot of people out on a Saturday afternoon, you know? 
 So this is on you. 
 DANNY:  How could we possibly have pulled over  this many Muslims today? 
 It's New York. 
 It's still a blind spot. 
 What have you got? 
 I got a 22-year-old male white from Queens stopped at 1:15 
 in Harlem. 
 Not Muslim. 
 Female in the car with him. 
 Didn't fully toss the SUV, but guys saw nothing suspicious. 
 Keep looking. 
 Remind me to kill my wife, if I ever find her. 
 Mildred Ames. 
 Stopped at 2:35 in Chelsea. 
 You know what? Call me crazy, but I'm going to guess that while it may be very exciting, 75 is probably a little bit too old to be a suicide bomber. 
 We don't know it's a suicide bomber. 
 Could be a remote detonation. 
 Yeah. Whatever. 
 Mary Jo Clarkson, Long Island. 
 Married... 
 Married to Alex Hass. 
 Alex Hass? 
 That's one of Khalid's cousins, right? 
 Think it's a coincidence? 
 Never is. 
 She's got no priors. Let's see if Mary Jo Clarkson has a social networking page that tells us all about her. 
 Alex Hass was questioned in his office at the university at 14:00 hours. 
 Teaches economics there. Westernized guy. No known contacts with any extremist groups. That doesn't matter, though. 
 His wife was pulled over in an SUV in Manhattan. 
 The SUV fit the description given to us by his bomb-making cousin. See if you can find that surveillance video of her stop. 
 Yep. 
 All right, Mary Jo Clarkson, married name Hass. Husband's name: Alex, one son, Jacob, age nine. 
 She's a member of the same radical mosque as Khalid. 
 She's an Islamic convert? 
 Yeah. 
 Usually, they're the most zealous. 
 Where was she when we stopped her? 
 She's got a link to a suicide bomber video right here on her page. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 How is she not flagged by Homeland Security? 
 I have no idea. 
 You know millions of people watch this crap every day. 
 Danny. 
 This is the shot from the checkpoint. 
 She's got a kid with her. 
 You know what? 
 Let's go scoop her husband. 
 Come on. 
 The photograph of Mary Jo Clarkson is going out right now, and Major Case is picking up her husband at the University. 
 We're stepping up deployment to downtown parks, especially Washington Square. 
 We don't stop looking at everyone else. 
 This is a lead, not a sure thing. 
 Understood. You know, finding her is only half the problem. 
 I know that. 
 J.T., call the mayor's office. 
 I think it's time we go public. 
 (knocking) 
 (knocking) 
 Alex Hass? 
 Yes? May I help you? 
 Yeah, step inside. What's going on? 
 You know where your wife is? 
 She's not my wife anymore. We're divorced. 
 Is something wrong? Back, back! 
 Yeah. Where is she? 
 She's on her way to meet me. 
 Is she all right? Meet you where? 
 Because my son's with her. All right. Meet you where? 
 Tell me what's going on. Where is she gonna meet you? 
 Here? No. At the park. 
 What park? Washington Square? 
 Yeah. You're scaring me. 
 Well, you're scaring me, too, buddy. 
 What's all this stuff on the blackboard there? 
 Huh? What's all that? 
 Economics. 
 Economics? 
 My thesis. Hey. Yeah. 
 She's gonna meet him in Washington Square Park. 
 Yeah. 
 Exactly when and where? 
 Uh, 4:00, near the Arch. 
 4:00, near the Arch. You got it? 
 Yeah. No, now. Bring the cavalry. 
 Let's go. 
 No. She has my son. 
 Tell me what's going on. 
 Why don't you tell me what's going on? 
 Why you meeting your wife? 
 I was... Come on! 
 I was awarded full custody of my son last Tuesday. 
 She's bringing him to me. 
 She just asked for one last night all together, said she had a beautiful place to show us. 
 Beautiful place? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, Alex. I need you to come with me right now. 
 Okay? I'll explain it outside. Let's go. 
 Come on. 
 Your wife, is she radical? 
 She converted to Islam two years ago and went completely nuts. 
 She and my cousin follow this radical imam in the Bronx. 
 I've been trying to get Jacob away from her ever since. 
 Is she crazy enough to make a bomb? 
 Oh, my God. No. Jacob is with her. 
 I got to get him away from her. 
 No, no, no. Listen to me. Listen to me. 
 You could be the trigger, okay? So slow down. 
 What do you mean? 
 The stuff she's saying to you. One last night together. 
 The beautiful place. Slow down. 
 Come on. 
 Take it easy. 
 What kind of world? 
 We're looking for a blonde housewife driving around with a bomb and a kid in the car. 
 The cop who let her through has got to be kicking himself. 
 I wouldn't want that hanging over me. 
 Though I can't say I wouldn't have done the same. 
 Probably saw the soccer balls back there, whatever she had the devices covered up with. 
 They must know where she is now, or at least her intended target. 
 Otherwise, they wouldn't be sending us down here, right? 
 All we know is we got a 10-85 
 to help set up a perimeter. 
 But a perimeter, must be to keep people away from an explosion. 
 We don't know that. All we know is we were told to report to the supervisor at the scene. 
 I'd like to know what we're getting into. Wouldn't you? 
 When you pass the captain's test, Reagan, you'll know. 
 For now, get used to not knowing and following orders. 
 Street cops get the worm's eye view. 
 You know what I mean, kid? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Am I sleeping at Daddy's house tonight? 
 We'll all be together tonight. 
 Where? 
 A beautiful place. 
 Where? 
 It's a surprise. 
 Is that her SUV? 
 ALEX: Oh, my God. 
 There they are. Hey, hey, hey! 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. What are you doing? 
 You over there is what she wants. 
 Okay? If she sees you, she's probably going to set off the bomb. 
 Okay, okay. You stay put. 
 Okay. 
 You stay out of sight. 
 Don't move. 
 Yeah. This is Detective Reagan, Shield number 8714. 
 I have a visual on the car bomb suspect at the corner of Washington Square North and Fifth Avenue. 
 Requesting 10-85 forthwith to clear the park. 
 Yeah, no radios. 
 No cell phones. Any electronics could set this thing off. 
 Yeah. 
 Where is he? Where's Daddy? 
 MAYOR:  It's a 4:00 press conference,  so media's waiting downstairs. 
 Let's talk about what we're going to say. 
 We give them a description of the woman and the vehicle. 
 Uh-huh? And tell them there's a bomb in the back seat? 
 We do. 
 (sighs) 
 Just saying it out loud, it's... 
 (sighs) 
 This is the right thing to do. 
 I think it is. 
 We've located the suspect. 
 Well, that changes everything. 
 DANNY: I need you to go back to the office, okay? 
 My boy... No, no, don't you understand? 
 Listen, she wants to blow you up, okay? 
 If I let you go over there, they're gonna be pulling our body parts from the trees. 
 She... wants us to stay together. 
 She wants you to stay together in Heaven, okay? 
 She sees you, it's over. 
 Go back to your office. 
 Would you leave your son? 
 I'm... I'm trying to save your son. 
 Okay? Your son. The bomb squad is on the way. 
 They're gonna get your son out of there. No, no, no. 
 If she sees the police, she'll set it off. 
 She'll never let him go. 
 I've tired to reason with her for two years. 
 We have to go get him. 
 I can't help you. I can't help you. 
 We're waiting for the bomb squad. 
 No, no, no, please, he's innocent. I... 
 He's nine years old. 
 Please, look at me. 
 He's my son. I can't go over there. 
 He's my son. 
 Don't move. Okay. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Mary Jo? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Danny. 
 Um, I work with Alex. 
 He wanted me to come over and-and get you guys and to let you know that he's gonna be tied up for awhile He wanted me to bring you over... 
 We'll wait here. Uh, tell him... tell him to come down. 
 Uh, uh, I know you probably want to wait, but he's really... 
 He's tied up with a student, and they're working really late, and it's gonna be a while, so he really wants you to come on with me. Why don't we walk over together, and you can be with Alex over there. 
 I don't want to leave my car here. 
 Okay, okay, well, I'll tell you what, I'll wait with you. 
 Okay? We'll stay here, we'll wait for Alex, and... 
 (sighs) 
 We'll just wait, okay? 
 Uh, I can't believe, um, I haven't met you guys before. 
 I do economics with Alex. 
 He speaks a lot about you. 
 What's your name, little man? 
 Jacob. 
 Jacob! Nice to meet you! 
 What are they doing over there? 
 Who are you? 
 I don't know who those people are, okay? 
 I'll tell you what. 
 I'll go get Alex, I'll bring him down, and you guys talk amongst yourselves, okay? 
 I'll bring him to you, all right? Hey? 
 Relax. 
 Daddy! 
 Jacob! 
 It's okay, baby! You're okay! 
 Alex! No! Do not come over here! 
 Step aside! Come over here! 
 Hey! You stay back! 
 DANNY: Get back! 
 MAYOR: What does your son think he's doing? 
 ALEX: Mary Jo, let him go! Have you lost your mind? 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 Get back behind the monument! Now! 
 We are married for eternity. 
 You cannot separate us! It's okay. 
 Get him out of there! Now! 
 Alex! Come back! I will blow this up! 
 No! No! I will kill your son! 
 Don't! Mary Jo! 
 No! 
 Mary Jo, look at me, look at me. Look at me! 
 You don't want to do that. 
 Okay? You don't want to do that. 
 DANNY: It's okay, all right? 
 You do not want to do this. 
 Okay? You don't want to die alone. 
 Hey, hey, I understand. 
 I understand, okay? You don't want to die alone. 
 You don't want to die without Alex, okay? 
 Don't do anything. 
 It's okay. 
 (crying) 
 This is not how it's supposed to go. 
 If she sets it off... 
 ESU's ready to move in and pull him out, Frank. 
 Sergeant... tell ESU to follow Detective Reagan's lead. 
 First officer on the scene always has the most information. 
 And he's a senior detective. 
 Stay back. 
 Okay. Mary Jo? 
 Mary Jo. 
 Look... 
 (crying) 
 It's okay, it's okay, you win. 
 I understand. You want to talk to Alex. 
 Yeah? I can help you with that, okay? 
 I just need you to be calm, okay? 
 Look, I'm gonna bring him over, but I need you to do something for me, all right? 
 I need you to keep your hands where I can see them. 
 Okay? I'll bring him over for you. 
 Okay? I'm gonna need you to put the remote control on the dashboard and show me your hands, all right? 
 Let's work together here. 
 All right? Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, okay. Now I need you to do something for me. 
 I need you to put the remote on the dashboard and then your hands where I can see them. 
 Just like we agreed to. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Come on. There you go. 
 And you're putting your hands where I can see them. 
 Okay. 
 (Mary Jo gasping) 
 (Mary Jo screaming) 
 ALEX: Jacob! 
 Jacob! 
 Jacob! 
 Jacob. 
 Bomb Squad defused the device. 
 And  the mayor's inviting you to join him at his press conference. 
 Where were you on 9/11? 
 I was with you. 
 Clearing out the north tower. 
 Sorry, I was thinking out loud. 
 I know where we were, Jim. 
 Everybody knows where they were when the towers went down. 
 That was your son out there. 
 Yes, it was. 
 Night, Frank. 
 Night, Jim. 
 JAMIE: Pizza pie! Get it while it's hot! 
 HENRY: Hey, where is everybody? 
 I expect Danny's filling out a lot of reports. 
 Yeah, I know, but I mean the others. 
 Hey, Pop. 
 JAMIE: Hey, the birthday boy isn't here yet? 
 I got him a white pie. Yeah, they should've been here by now. 
 DANNY: I smell hot, delicious cardboard. 
 Ah, hail the conquering hero! 
 You wouldn't know it from the ass-chewing I just got from my sergeant, the ESU sergeant, the SWAT team, the task force. 
 You did good, son. 
 If you got your ass chewed, you deserved it. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 Where's Linda and the kids? 
 She'll be here. 
 LINDA (calls): Hey, everybody! 
 In here! 
 (door closes) 
 Oh, what a day! 
 Hey. 
 Hey, happy birthday! I'm starving. 
 ERIN: Happy birthday! Thanks. 
 Oh, but we had a good time, didn't we guys? Huh? 
 We saw polar bears, gorillas... 
 Sorry it took so long to get here. 
 The subway was so crowded. 
 Some incident downtown. 
 How about you guys, everybody have a good day? 
 What? 
 Nothing. What's wrong? 
 Come on, boys. 
 Is everything all right? Yeah, everything's great. 
 How was the zoo, huh? 
 SEAN: The polar bear was giant! 
 JACK: And the gorilla smelled like poo. 
 Gorillas always smell like poo. 
 DANNY: Come on, sit down. 
 Seriously... what's going on? 
 We'll tell you all about it. 
 Right now our pizza needs attention. 
 Mom, can I eat on the back porch? 
 Uh... Frank? 
 I didn't make up the rules for dinner. Pop? 
 HENRY: Well, on Sundays we always eat at the dinner table. 
 But on birthday Saturdays, anything goes. 
 But... after grace. 
 Aw... 
 Grandpa, where's your cane? 
 Well, I've ditched it. 
 If I don't get my balance back, how am I gonna teach my great-grandkids how to play handball? 
 I want to say something. 
 We all went our separate ways this morning, and we all expected to return to our family to celebrate this wonderful young man's birthday. 
 And here we are. 
 And I feel very blessed and fortunate for that. 
 Well, that was  kind  of grace. 
 Can I go now? Yeah. Go, go. 
 Keep it right-side up. 
 Okay, Mom. 
 And don't make a mess. 
 Jamie? 
 Bless us, O Lord, for these gifts we are about to receive...
