 Jack! 
 Yeah. 
 Sean! 
 Coming. 
 Time to go. Come on. 
 Coming, Dad. Coming. 
 All right. Where's my left attack? 
 Right here. All right. 
 And my right attack? 
 Here. 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 You guys get your helmets and get your stuff ready, and Mom will take you to practice. 
 Got it. 
 LINDA: Maid's off today, Danny. 
 Hmm? 
 Dishwasher. 
 And your fork. 
 (sighs) 
 Something wrong? 
 Something's got to be wrong 
 'cause I don't want to be your personal servant? 
 Well, I don't know. You've just been giving me the stink eye since I rolled out of bed. 
 Yeah, at noon. 
 Is that what this is about? 
 Hello. I worked a midnight tour. 
 Which is why I asked you to mow the lawn and take care of the leaves yesterday. 
 I didn't mow the lawn. 
 I'll get it. 
 Get out of here. I'll get it. 
 (sighs) 
 Been a real pleasure. 
 There's a suggestion box around the corner, Detective. 
 I don't know how you n stand it around here. 
 Well, it's the little things. 
 You know, the deluxe accommodations, first-class travel. 
 Right. What's going on? 
 Well, one of your lackeys tossed my case. 
 That was my call. 
 Your call? 
 Yeah, you have one witness who's got a rap sheet longer than the perp's. 
 Well, I'm sorry His Eminence the Archbishop didn't just happen to be standing in an alley on 125th Street the night my victim was mugged. 
 Danny, we cannot spend money on cases we know we're not going to win. 
 You think you can't win. 
 You don't know you can't win. 
 No, I do. 
 Which is why they went to the trouble of painting my name on the door. 
 If you guys aren't going to prosecute these people, we might as well just shoot them in the street! 
 What's this? 
 DANNY: Oh, you don't want this stuff? 
 You know, I thought it had some sentimental value to you, and that's why you left it in the car that I'm driving today. I thought Rubino grabbed them. 
 Oh, did you think Rubino filled the gas tank, too? 
 You know, what happens if my partner and I are chasing down some mutt and he squirts because the tank is empty? 
 (sighs) 
 I'll fill it up now. 
 No, you'll fill it up at the end of your tour the way you're supposed to. 
 The same way every other detective around here does. 
 You got it? 
 Everything okay, Reagan? 
 Everything's fine, Sarge... just peachy keen. 
 Kelsey and I are just going over ways to make things more efficient around here, right? 
 Right. JACKIE: - Come on, Reagan. 
 We just caught our first tour. 
 At least we'll have a clean car. 
 Enjoy your tour. 
 Yeah, it's going to be a good one. 
 DANNY: Tell us what happened. 
 WOMAN: He tried to kill me! 
 MAN: It was a cantaloupe. She threw it at me first. 
 You have to arrest him. Hold on. Hold on. 
 The weapon was a cantaloupe? 
 Yeah, down from that window. 
 Nearly hit me in the head. 
 Could've given me a concussion. 
 Oh, and you decided to throw it back up? 
 Yeah, and he smashed the window. 
 Glass was flying everywhere. Look! 
 All right, here's what we're going to do. 
 We're going to go find someone who's an actual criminal... maybe someone with a honeydew. 
 Okay? Good night. Hey! 
 This was attempted murder. 
 And that is assault on a police officer. 
 How would you like it if I arrest you, ma'am? 
 Hey. Why don't you do your job? 
 Huh? What are we paying you for? 
 You're paying me to deal with fruitcakes like you. 
 Oh, really? You hear him? Fruitcakes with fruit. 
 Are you gonna let him talk to me this way? 
 Enough. Shut up! 
 Be a man! 
 I'm going to arrest you, okay? 
 Reagan, let's go. She wants me to earn my pay, I'm going to earn it right now. 
 Reagan, I'm getting in the car! 
 You'll spend the night in jail. 
 No. Come on. 
 Yeah, you are. Police! Help me! 
 I'm going to arrest... JACKIE: - Reagan! 
 Step aside. Step aside. 
 Where you going? 
 There's a guy chasing me. 
 He's got a gun. 
 Move away! Get back. 
 Hey! 
 Drop the weapon! 
 Police! I said drop your weapon! 
 Drop it! JACKIE: - Police! Drop your weapon! 
 (train screeching) 
 JACKIE: Yeah, Central. 
 Shots fired. 
 We have one perp down. 
 We have a 10-85. 
 He's still breathing. Get a bus. 
 Need an ambulance at the corner of 18th and McDonald. 
 Jackie. 
 He's a cop. 
 We have a 10-13. 
 We have an officer down. 
 (ringing) 
 Reagan. 
 I'm on my way. 
 Francis? 
 How bad? 
 Hey! You hang on! 
 You hear me? I am not going to lose you! 
 Jackie! 
 I'm going as fast as I can. 
 Go faster! 
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey. 
 You keep your eyes open. 
 Do not close your eyes on me, damn it. 
 (honking horn) 
 Listen to me. 
 (siren blaring) 
 Listen, he's a cop. 
 He's a cop. His name is Lou Tedesco. 
 Who's a doctor here? 
 I am. 
 He's got two rounds to the chest. 
 Nine-millimeter, about 12 minutes ago. 
 You hear me? Come on! 
 We got him, Detective. 
 Come on. Hurry up. 
 Let go, Detective! Wait! 
 We got him. Help him. 
 Help him. We've got him. We've got him. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Here you go. 
 Any news? 
 Nurse came by. 
 He's still in surgery. 
 They had to remove part of his lung, Jack. 
 He's got internal bleeding and a concussion from falling down the steps. 
 (sighs) 
 (footsteps) 
 (crying) 
 That's Tedesco's wife. 
 Heard her talking to the doctor. 
 Look at me. 
 Danny. 
 It was a good shoot. 
 There's nothing good about this, Jackie. 
 He did not identify himself as a police officer. 
 You did what you were supposed to do. 
 We did what we were trained to do. 
 You didn't fire. 
 'Cause the cantaloupe people were in my way. 
 But you know what? If they weren't, I'd be in the exact same boat as you. 
 Don't do this to yourself. 
 Detectives Reagan, Curatola? 
 Captain Derek Elwood. 
 I'll be the shooting team leader on this. 
 Are you two holding up? 
 Fine, sir. 
 Yeah. 
 As you know, Detective Reagan, I'm going to need to ask you some questions. 
 But before I do, I need to advise you that you're entitled to have your union representative and your counsel present. 
 Do you wish to do so? 
 No. Danny. 
 It's all right. 
 I got nothing to hide. 
 Right this way. 
 We identified ourselves and... we yelled out for him to stop three or four times. 
 He just kept coming. 
 Was it, uh... was it three or four times... 
 ...that you told him to stop? 
 I don't know. And you're certain that he, uh, never identified himself as a police officer? 
 Yeah. 
 How sure? 
 He never said he was a cop. 
 Did he say anything? 
 I don't think so. 
 You don't think so? 
 (sighs) 
 It was loud. 
 There was a train coming in overhead. 
 It was noisy. I don't think so. 
 Okay. 
 Why don't you go back to your squad, Detective, fill out your firearms discharge report, and we'll be in touch. 
 Officer Tedesco's still in surgery. 
 I'm afraid he's critical, Frank. 
 His wife and son are here, and we're doing everything we can to make them comfortable. 
 I'd like a moment with her when she's up to it. 
 Of course. I read Tedesco's file. 
 He's a good cop. 
 Danny's okay. 
 As you were. 
 Ed? 
 Do we know why Officer Tedesco was in pursuit? 
 No. He was off duty. 
 We're checking, but it doesn't appear that he made any 911 calls. 
 We do know that he lives in the vicinity. 
 Possibly he came upon a crime in progress. 
 Let's know, not guess. 
 What about the male white he was chasing? 
 Nothing yet, sir. 
 We need to find him, Ed. 
 Commissioner. 
 Commissioner! 
 Is it true this was a friendly fire incident? 
 Uh, we're still in the information gathering phase of this investigation, so we won't be discussing details till we have all the facts. 
 A blogger is reporting that your son was the detective who fired the shots, Commissioner. 
 Can you confirm that? 
 Okay, people, how many times... 
 We have an officer down. 
 As much as we'd appreciate your understanding and compassion in this delicate circumstance, I realize that is an unrealistic hope. 
 Okay, Jane, Matt, you know what? 
 Why don't you come this way? 
 Let me share what details I can offer. 
 (horns honking in distance) 
 Danny? 
 Danny? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Of course I'm here. 
 Who's with the kids? 
 Erin and Nicky. They're fine. They're sound asleep. 
 How are you? I'm all right. 
 I'm all right. I'm not so sure about that. I'm fine. 
 It's fine, and everything's gonna be fine. 
 Okay? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 JACKIE: Danny? 
 How many times do you have to hear...? 
 We have an officer down. 
 As much as we we'd appreciate your understanding and compassion in this delicate circumstance, I realize that is an unrealistic hope. 
 REPORTER: And while the commissioner will not give details on the shooting, there is one eyewitness, Ms. Angela Jackson, and she described Detective Reagan as being angry and agitated immediately before the incident. 
 Angela, can you please tell us what happened? 
 Yeah. He was out of control. 
 He was screaming at me for no reason. 
 And then, he was even screaming at his partner. 
 And then, the next thing I know, he turns around, and he shoots the guy. 
 I'm-I'm telling you, he was out of control. 
 It appears this witness, Angela Jackson, has an axe to grind with Detective Reagan. 
 Be nice if one of the hundred reporters she gave her exclusive to did some actual reporting and dug that up. 
 ELWOOD: Well, other witnesses on the street also described Detective Reagan as... being agitated. 
 MOORE: People who don't have an axe to grind with Detective Reagan? 
 Yes. 
 But this investigation is far from complete. 
 I mean, there-there's precedence for waiting to hear... 
 We're not going to look for reasons not to go by the book here. 
 Is that clear? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You will conduct a complete, thorough and impartial investigation. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (sighs) 
 You know, you're the worst client I've ever had. 
 Thank you. 
 You pop off at the hospital. 
 The press is salivating, Frank. 
 When do they not? 
 I'm just saying, it wouldn't hurt if you told the media what you just told Captain Elwood. 
 Wouldn't hurt you. Might kill me. 
 Here we go. Here we go, what, Garrett? Here you go, making our jobs ten times more difficult than they have to be. 
 You're making the right call. 
 The press would lap it up. Just let 'em. 
 No, I will not just let them. Why the hell not? 
 Because I don't like pandering on my best day. 
 He's my son... 
 Garrett. 
 (sighs) 
 They don't teach this stuff at the academy. 
 You could recuse yourself. 
 You're gonna have to do something, Frank. 
 I have a credible report that a member of my department was, quote, "out of control" 
 just before he shot a fellow officer. 
 I know damn well what I have to do. 
 Jack? Hey. JACKIE: - Yeah. 
 TARU loaded up the surveillance video from the subway platform. 
 Oh. Anything? 
 Oh, yeah. Come on. 
 Take a look. 
 Oh, what do you know? 
 That's our guy. Oh, yeah. 
 We're distributing a screen-grab of this kid's mug citywide. 
 We find him, we find out what Tedesco was doing. 
 There's no train in the station. 
 No. 
 They probably came up from the street. 
 Ran up one staircase and down the other one. 
 Yeah. There's Tedesco. 
 (sighs) 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, you see that? 
 Yeah. 
 Look. 
 Gun. Was he strapped? 
 Not when we saw him. 
 Watch. 
 Look. 
 ESU's looking for it as we speak. 
 Let's go help them. 
 (mutters) 
 Reagan. 
 Come on, Sarge. We just got our first break. 
 Can it wait? 
 No, it can't wait. 
 Okay. 
 What is it? 
 You're being put on modified assignment. 
 What? Word just came down from the commissioner's office. 
 So, I'm a house mouse. 
 Mm-hmm. You can't leave that desk. 
 Right. 
 And you know what else. 
 I'll keep 'em warm for you, Detective. 
 (sighs) 
 (boat horn blowing) 
 (boat horn blowing) 
 (sighs) 
 You did what you had to do. 
 You got nothing to feel guilty about. 
 What makes you think I feel guilty? 
 'Cause you got a hero in that bag from Ziggy's with my name on it. 
 No shield, and still one of my best detectives. 
 How's Tedesco? 
 He's still unconscious. 
 How are you? 
 We can't really talk about it, can we? 
 No, we can't. 
 You ever wonder why I never ask you to go fishing? 
 You got the attention span of a gnat. 
 Remember that summer Uncle Jim offered me a job as a telemarketer in Jersey? 
 I am still amazed you were able to resist the allure of hustling aluminum siding. 
 Yeah, that took guts. 
 (chuckles) 
 That was the same summer you told me you were going to take the cop test. 
 Remember what I said? 
 "Never buy aluminum siding from a company with no fixed address"? 
 The other thing I said. 
 "New York's Finest just got a little better." 
 That's as true today as it was then. 
 I don't know, Dad. 
 I do. 
 ELWOOD:  So would you  say Detective Reagan was feeling angry? 
 No, I would not say that. 
 I have no earthly idea how he was feeling. 
 Erin, we're not arguing in front of a jury. 
 There's no need for you to view me as the enemy. 
 Really, Derek? 
 Well, it's nice to know that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
 Don't forget that I am usually the one asking the questions. 
 Okay, let's go to it then. 
 Did Detective Reagan say anything to make you question his performance as a New York City police detective? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Are you sure he never said, uh... 
 "If you guys won't prosecute 'em, "maybe we should just shoot 'em in the street"? 
 Come on. He was frustrated. 
 We had just tossed his case. 
 He was just blowing off steam. 
 Oh, so you could tell he was feeling angry? 
 Just leave it right there, okay? Thanks. 
 You're doing more on modified than most of my guys do full duty. 
 Well, Sarge, Tedesco wasn't chasing that guy for nothing. 
 Been fishing through these Sprint reports looking for any whiff of activity within a half mile of the incident. 
 And? 
 So far, I got an anonymous 911 caller, reported a woman screaming ten blocks from the El where Tedesco ran into us, 
 18 minutes earlier. 
 Responding officer reported nobody was there. 
 He closed it out, 10-90X. 
 Okay, well, why was nobody there, Sarge? 
 I mean, somebody was screaming, right? 
 What, did she disappear? 
 Don't you remember patrol, Reagan? 
 We used to get ten of these a tour. 
 Probably some lady screaming because she saw a spider in the sink. 
 Lab came back on the gun your guy tossed. 
 No prints of value. 
 Great. But... there was blood on it. 
 They're running it now along with ballistics. 
 That's beautiful. 
 You hear that, Jack? We got... 
 JACKIE:  Look,  this woman was giving us a hard time. 
 Danny gave her a hard time right back. 
 That's how it goes on the job. You know that. 
 But what doesn't happen every day... two partners getting into it in the middle of the street. 
 Danny and I have a... a unique... dynamic. 
 If what you're telling me is that you and your partner routinely scream at each other, maybe it's time one of you get reassigned. 
 That's not what I'm saying. 
 Then say what you're saying. 
 I think the issue here is whether or not Officer Tedesco identified himself as a police offer. 
 And I am telling you he did not. 
 How can you be sure? 
 Because I was there. 
 Yeah, you were there. 
 You were screaming at Detective Reagan, and he was screaming at you and Mrs. Jackson, and all this is going on while a... a man is running down the stairs yelling that another man with a gun is trying to kill him? 
 I don't think it's a stretch that we consider the possibility that maybe, while all this was going on, maybe Officer Tedesco did identify himself. 
 And maybe, just maybe, Detective Reagan was not in the mood to listen. 
 Captain, don't do this. 
 We're not through yet, Detective. 
 Don't do this. 
 I'm doing my job. 
 Did Detective Reagan do his? 
 We were at the wrong place at the wrong time. 
 Danny did the right thing. 
 Hey. 
 You still here. Good. Yeah. 
 Danny, this guy from I.A., I... 
 Don't worry about him. 
 Okay? I'm not worried about him. 
 You want to worry about someone? 
 Let's worry about Officer Tedesco, okay? 
 Let's worry about finding the guy that he was chasing. 
 Now a 911 caller said a woman was screaming at this address. 
 Can you go find out why? 
 (sighs) 
 (slams papers down) 
 WOMAN: I don't know anything about that. 
 I didn't hear anything. Well, a 911 caller said there were screams coming from your house. 
 (chuckles): Maybe it was the TV. 
 Are you sure, Mrs. Lee? 
 This is really very important. 
 Somebody made a mistake. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. You know what? 
 My phone went dead. 
 You know, I-I really need to call in to close this out. 
 Do you mind if I use your phone? 
 I don't... Please? 
 It'll just take a second... my boss is gonna kill me if I don't finish this. 
 Thank you. 
 It's right... Yeah. 
 Um, please hurry... I'm late for an appointment. 
 Yeah, it'll just take one second. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hey. 
 Yeah. It's me. 
 I'm in Ms. Lee's living room. 
 Yeah, my-mcell died. 
 You running a game? 
 Okay, I'll hold. 
 (sighs) So, what were you watching last night? 
 A movie, or one of those talk guys? 
 (chuckles): I don't remember. 
 Well, if it was one of those talk guys, then there wouldn't be any screaming going on, unless there's some... 
 Oh, wow. 
 That's a great photo. 
 Huh. 
 Who's in the photo with you? 
 Uh, that's... my son. 
 Is that also your son? 
 Danny, we're coming in. 
 Yeah, get her in, get her in. 
 He used to be a good boy. 
 (sobbing): He was gonna go to college. 
 He was gonna study hotel administration. 
 DANNY: Your son's not reading too good from where we're sitting, Mrs. Lee. 
 Yesterday he did something that got a police officer shot, and that police officer's in critical condition now. 
 It's the drugs. 
 He's not my Tyler anymore. 
 I don't know who he is. 
 So he  was  at your house last night. 
 So you were the one screaming. 
 When he runs out of money for drugs for him and his girlfriend, he comes to see me. 
 He takes money, whatever I have that he can sell. 
 It used to happen every now and then, and now... now it's all the time. 
 So your son came to rob you yesterday? 
 I told him I wasn't gonna give him another red cent. 
 And then he pulled out a gun. 
 On me. 
 His own mother. 
 And that's why you screamed. 
 I ran out of the house. I... 
 I told him to shoot me. 
 I begged him... to put me out of my misery. 
 Then I looked in his eyes... 
 ...and there was nothing there. 
 (sobbing): I think he was gonna do it. 
 And then that man came over. 
 You mean this man? 
 Go ahead, look at him. 
 I didn't know he was a police officer. 
 He must have seen us fighting. 
 He came over and told Tyler to get his hands off me, and Tyler ran. 
 And that man ran after him. 
 Why didn't you call the police? 
 (crying) 
 He's my son. 
 So... how was he when he left here yesterday? 
 Uh... he was normal. 
 Normal. 
 We're hearing that he was unusually tense yesterday, and we're just wondering... when that started. 
 (laughs) 
 Danny is an intense guy. 
 Yeah. He loves the job, and that's where he puts his energy... plus me and the boys. 
 Right. 
 So yesterday there was nothing unusual. 
 Well, he left his dish on the counter. 
 (laughs): That's plenty usual. 
 And then what happened? 
 Then he went to work. 
 Okay. 
 I see. Well, thank you very much for your hospitality. 
 It's much appreciated. 
 I'm just curious. 
 How did that... vase get broken? 
 Then he saw that vase. 
 I told him it was an accident, but I don't know, I think he got the wrong idea. 
 You did the right thing, Linda. 
 Don't worry about it. 
  (sighs) "The right thing"" 
 I don't even know what that is anymore. 
 You know? 
 I'm sorry, but... the years that you've given this department, the sacrifices that you've made, the... the toll that it's taken on... on us and the kids, and this is the thanks we get. 
 Being railroaded by some guy. 
 Babe, he's I.A., okay? 
 That's what they do. 
 It's not right. 
 Someone could damn well tell him so. 
 Someone? 
 Would it be the end of the world if he stepped in? 
 (sighs) 
 It may not make a lot of sense, and it may hurt like hell to hear it, but yes... it would be the end of the world. 
 (sighs) 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 (phone ringing) 
 (sighs) 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 You're up. Well, I was going to leave a message, but... 
 What do you got? 
 Well, the blood came back on Tyler Lee's gun, and it's Officer Tedesco's. 
 Tedesco? How could that be? 
 But wait, it gets better. 
 Ballistics matches the gun to a liquor store holdup last week. 
 Robber shot and killed the owner. 
 Looks like our Tyler Lee is a murderer. 
 (vehicle passing) 
 Where are you? 
 Home. 
 Danny. 
 Look, don't freak out, all right? 
 I'm sitting on Mrs. Lee's house. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 I said, don't freak out. 
 Well, it's too late, Danny. 
 Seriously? You're modified. 
 If they catch you out there, you're gonna be suspended or worse. 
 I know, I know, but I was thinking, Tyler didn't get the money last time he came home, which means he's probably gonna come back. 
 And when he does, he's gonna find an old friend waiting for him. 
 No, he's not. You need to get out of there now. 
 Oh, come on, Jack, five more minutes. 
 Danny. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Listen, I'm starting my car. 
 (engine starts) 
 You hear that? Okay, and now I'm driving away. 
 All right, I'll call you tomorrow. 
 (turns off engine) 
 (sighs) 
 (vehicle approaching) 
 (siren chirps) 
 (other engine turns off) 
 (groans) 
 OFFICER (over speaker): Put your hands where we can see them. 
 (groans) 
 Sir, step out the car. 
 Look, it's okay, guys, I'm on the job. 
 We got a call about a suspicious car in the neighborhood. 
 Can we see your shield? 
 I don't have it. 
 Tom Julien from the two-nine called. 
 Two of his people picked up Danny out on the street, and he was working the case. 
 What'd you tell Tom to do? 
 His job. 
 (sighs) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Can you pass the corn, please? 
 Do I have to eat this? 
 Yes. 
 Grandpa? Are you gonna fire my dad? 
 Sean. 
 I'm sorry, Frank. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I think it's wrong to punish Danny for doing his job. 
 I mean, I get it... Uncle Danny shouldn't have been out on the street, but... his intentions were good. 
 Cop to cop, Dad, I think Danny's earned a little leeway here. 
 HENRY: Francis, in my day, we probably turned the other way too often when it came to one of our own. 
 But sometimes it was the right thing to do. 
 Being held to the same standard as everyone else is one thing, but it does feel like Danny's being held to a higher one. 
 You're damn straight he is. 
 When I coached you in softball or you boys in hoops, I always held you to a higher standard because you're capable of meeting it, and because you are... I expect it. 
 Danny, I don't think there's a cop at this table... not your grandpa, not me, not Jamie... who wouldn't have made the same decision you did in that split second. 
 But he worked the street without a shield. 
 And it can't matter why. 
 And it shouldn't matter that he's my son. 
 He's right. 
 Dad's right. 
 Orders are orders, and every cop ought to know it. 
 I was out of line. 
 I raised your father the way he raised all of you... to know the difference between right and wrong. 
 Never thought I'd be almost sorry I did. 
 What's bothering you? 
 Nothing. 
 Hey. Don't think I still can't sweat a guy. 
 I made this robbery collar. 
 Took this guy out with my asp... he never saw it coming. 
 What's going on? 
 Renzulli wasn't too happy about it, because I didn't draw my weapon. 
 This perp was armed? 
 No. But, well, we thought he might have been. 
 Turns out it was just his hand in his pocket. 
 Well, then you're lucky you were riding with Renzulli and not me. 
 I would've knocked your teeth in. 
 The guy wasn't armed. 
 Why did you hesitate? 
 Come on, Jamie. 
 What if I hesitated to draw for the wrong reason? 
 Two cops, two Reagan cops, involved in a shooting in the same week? 
 You're thinking like a lawyer. 
 Look, you're coming into your own, as a cop. 
 You're improvising, that's good. 
 But when you're out on the job, you can't be thinking about what your brother did or who your father is. 
 You do your job. 
 Understand? 
 Yes, Grandpa. 
 Like they used to tell us at the academy, better you should have to explain to the D.A. why you shot a guy than have someone have to explain to your family why you didn't. 
 FRANK: Grandpa's right, son. 
 Better to be judged by 12 than carried by six. 
 We're most proud of you when you come home safe. 
 DANNY: Hey, what's going on? 
 I picked up your stakeout where you left off. 
 Seems like Tyler did go back to Mommy again. 
 You got him? 
 No. He sent a messenger, his better half. 
 Meet Lydia Pepper, Tyler's girlfriend. 
 How many times do you need to hear it? 
 I don't know where Tyler is. 
 You do know where he is, because he sent you to his mother's house to go pick up clothes. 
 No. No. 
 This boyfriend of yours, he must be some charmer, huh? 
 He pulls a gun on his own mother, and then he sends his little girlfriend in to fight his own battles... and you're still sitting here protecting him? 
 Look, I told you, he keeps moving around. 
 When he wants me, he finds me. DANNY: - Come on, Lydia. 
 We can tell you been getting high so long that you're numb to the outside world. 
 But I also think that deep down there's still someone who knows what it means to do the right thing. 
 There is a police officer on life support right now because of what Tyler did. 
 His name is Lou Tedesco. 
 He's got a wife and a little boy and a baby on the way. Hey. 
 Look at his picture. 
 Look at the picture. 
 Look at the picture! 
 There's no running away from this one, you understand me? 
 You could smoke every rock in this city, but you will not get this one off of your conscience. 
 It's all her fault. 
 What? 
 If she just did what Tyler said, none of this would've happened. 
 Wait a minute, who are we talking about here, Lydia? 
 Tyler's mother, Mrs. Lee. 
 Why didn't she just give us the money? 
 So you were there. 
 Across the street. 
 What happened? 
 She and Tyler were on the stoop yelling at each other. 
 She wouldn't give him anything, and Tyler was losing it. 
 He starts grabbing her, and suddenly this guy steps in and tries to break it up. 
 This guy, Officer Tedesco? 
 He grabs Tyler and tries to put him up against the wall... that's when Mrs. Lee grabbed Tyler's gun and whacked him over the head. 
 And Tyler and the guy took off running. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Mrs. Lee grabbed a gun and... and-and whacked Officer Tedesco in the head? 
 Yeah. 
 Hard? 
 When he ran off, he was stumbling like he was drunk. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm gonna go make a call. 
 ELWOOD: Detective Reagan's mental state at the time of the shooting appears to have been a negative factor in his decision making. 
 But I have received some new information this morning that will shed light on the circumstances of the shooting. 
 Please enlighten us. 
 ELWOOD: Officer Tedesco was struck in the head with the suspect's gun at the start of the incident. 
 Now, that would account for the head trauma that had been attributed to his fall down the stairs after he was shot. 
 He received that blow before the foot chase? 
 Well, his doctors are surprised he was able to walk, let alone identify himself as a police officer... which supports Detective Reagan's testimony. 
 And does any of that excuse Detective Reagan's violation of his modified status? All due respect, sir, that's not my call. 
 No, Captain. It's mine. 
 We had a team on Tyler Lee's girlfriend all night. 
 He never showed. Now Curatola's tailing her, thinking she may be headed for a meet. 
 She could use some backup. 
 Why are you telling me, Sarge? 
 Can't you see I'm busy sharpening pencils? 
 Did I forget to mention? 
 You've been restored to full duty. 
 Congratulations. 
 (sighs) 
 (exhales) 
 Heard you need a little backup. 
 Oh. Look who got out of the penalty box again. 
 Yep. Except now, it's official. 
 JACKIE: I kind of liked you in the office, you know. 
 Oh, you like my coffee, huh? 
 Yes, exactly. 
 It's always nice and hot. 
 You think she made us? No. 
 No sense taking any chances, though. 
 Gonna give her a little space. 
 What, is she texting again? 
 DANNY: You think she's trying to get in contact with Tyler? 
 Yeah, the first ten times I thought so, but now I just think she's got more friends than me. 
 There he is. 
 DANNY: Grab her. 
 I'm on him. Yeah. 
 Hey! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! 
 DANNY: Get out of the way! Hold on! 
 Move! 
 Hey! 
 (tires screech) 
 Come here! 
 Come here, come here! 
 You still looking for the police, dirtbag? Huh? 
 Guess what? I'm right here. 
 (handcuffs clicking) 
 So, the doctors said they had never seen a patient fight their way back the way you did. 
 And I said, "What do you expect? 
 He comes out of the six-five." 
 Your old house. 
 I see they taught you the job the same way they taught me. 
 No retreat, no surrender. 
 Get well. 
 Get back on the street; do us proud. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (knocking at door) 
 I see you have another visitor. 
 (sighs) 
 Good thing I'm not a great shot.
