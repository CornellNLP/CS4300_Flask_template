 (alarm chirps) 
 You know the drill. 
 Yeah, I'm right here. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Hey, honey, how are you? 
 Oh, I'm just heading into the governor's office. 
 Doesn't look like I'm getting out of here till after dinner. 
 Shoot. I completely forgot. 
 Look, uh... tell Erin I'm sorry I missed her, and you guys have fun, okay? 
 All right. 
 Call you from the road. 
 (bell ringing) 
 Cole sends his love, but he's stuck in Albany so he has to bag on dinner. 
 Aw. Love back. 
 Hey. We're two single gals, looking for trouble tonight. 
 BAKER: The Haitian ambassador's requested a meeting to formally thank you for the NYPD's help in his country. 
 I've slotted him in between PBA and Port Authority Superintendant. 
 Thank you, Baker. 
 Have this hand-delivered to the mayor-elect, first thing tomorrow morning. 
 Sir. 
 It's customary. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 How's your father faring with Mayor Poole? 
 Well, he resigned today. 
 Mmm! 
 All the commissioners offer letters of resignation when the new mayor's elected. 
 And my father is nothing if not customary. 
 Well, I'm sure it will be okay. 
 Cole has worked closely with Poole, and he really likes him. 
 Well, I think the question is if Poole like Commissioner Reagan. 
 And my dad's too proud to sit around and wait for the ax to fall. 
 Hello? 
 Anybody looking for a party? 
 (screaming) 
 (running footsteps) 
 Farragaut. Where do I know that name from? 
 JACKIE: Yeah, he's a big fund-raiser guy for the new mayor. 
 You know, it's been in all the papers the last couple months. 
 No, no, I know about that. 
 I'm not talking about that. It's something else. 
 Wait a minute. He's married. 
 His wife, Lisa Farragaut, she's an old friend of my sister. 
 I gotta make the call, Jack. 
 Yeah, I'll be there in a few. 
 Okay, just promise me that you're going to let me pay the next time. 
 This is not a freebie. 
 There's a guy I want you to meet. 
 Okay, I'm giving you cash right now. 
 He's divorced, he has a daughter Nicky's age, looks like the guy on  Mad Men. 
 Ooh, poor girl. 
 No, he does. 
 He lives near us in Chappaqua, but he works in Midtown. 
 Okay. Hold on. Danny? 
 I'm in a restaurant. Can I just call you right back? 
 Yeah, actually I'm with... 
 What? 
 No, wh-what are you talking about? 
 Are you positive? 
 Okay, I'm gonna... I'll call you back later. 
 No, I... I'll call you back. 
 Erin? 
 What's the matter? 
 I think we should go, okay? 
 What's going on? 
 Just come with me. 
 Erin? 
 Erin, tell me what's going on. 
 Just... let's just go outside, okay? 
 Erin, wait. 
 I'm sorry, excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Erin, please just tell me what Danny told you. 
 It's Cole. 
 What? 
 Wh...? 
 I'm sorry. 
 What are you... 
 I don't know, I... 
 Oh, God. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 (sobbing) 
 {pub}RENZULLI: All right, guys, listen up. 
 I'm only gonna say this once. Just once. 
 Each team is to blend in with the clientele at your locations. 
 Observe and report on the service of alcohol to minors and/or the buying and selling of narcotics on the premises. 
 Reagan, you'll be working with Atwater. 
 Any questions? 
 Atwater. 
 How many nights are we talking about? 
 Three, tops. 
 You'll all be back in the bag come Friday. 
 If we're supposed to blend in, can we have a drink ourselves, Sarge? 
 Maximum two, so make it last. 
 (laughter) 
 All right, let's hit the street. 
 Beats working patrol, huh? 
 Say that again. 
 Hey, Reagan. 
 So, uh, you think you can manage out there without me? 
 I guess we'll find out, huh? 
 Your first undercover assignment. 
 It's a big night. 
 Appreciate the opportunity, Sarge. 
 Just remember this: the uniform does half the job. 
 So eyes wide open. 
 Okay? 
 I want my favorite driver back in one piece. 
 Lisa. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Is there's anything I can do? 
 Thank you, Frank. 
 We'll do everything possible to find who did this, I promise you. 
 I'm going to take her home and spend the night. 
 No, no, that's really not necessary. 
 Please, please. 
 Can you take Nicky for the night and make sure she gets to school? 
 Done. 
 I need to get out of here. I'll meet you out front. 
 Dad... 
 Cole told her he was stuck in Albany and couldn't make dinner. 
 Do the detectives know? No. 
 No, I haven't left her side. 
 Does the mayor know he's dead? 
 He knows. 
 Go with Lisa, I'll get Nicky. 
 Thanks. 
 (sighs) 
 (laughter, chattering, country music playing) 
 Here you go, pal. 
 Twenty-eight. 
 For-for two drinks? 
 Service included. 
 Bet you a drink I can guess where you went to college. 
 Um, sorry, but I'm not a... not a gambling man. 
 Oh, it's not gambling. 
 If she guesses which college you went to, you buy us both a drink. 
 She's, uh, really good. 
 She's, like, got sick sense. 
 You mean, sixth sense? 
 (laughs) 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. I get to ask three questions. 
 Mandy, don't be a whore. 
 Screw you, Brian. 
 I was just guessing where he went to college. 
 Westchester Community? 
 (laughter) 
 Mm, I'm fading. 
 Bump me? 
 Little young for you, no? 
 Just minding my own business here, pal. 
 You saying my girlfriend was hitting on you? 
 Not saying anything. 
 Bry-bry... take it someplace else. 
 (scoffs) 
 Dalton lacrosse goons. 
 I swear to God, they put something in the water over there. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, I know you, right? 
 I don't think so. 
 Yeah, yeah, I do. 
 Noble Sanfino. 
 Jimmy. How you doing? 
 Saint David's, right? 
 Sorry man, can't help you. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, I... 
 I know I know you. 
 Whatever. 
 (chuckles) 
 It'll come to me. 
 Hey. 
 How's Lisa doing? 
 I just spent the night at her house. 
 Neither slept a wink. 
 What do you got? 
 Nothing that's going to give her any comfort. 
 Her husband wasn't in Albany yesterday. 
 At all. 
 Where was he? 
 Good question. 
 (phone ringing) 
 The labs are processing the evidence from the crime scene, trying to put together a time line of his last few hours. 
 Reagan. 
 Parking records show that he got five tickets in the last three months on a pretty skeevy block in the Lower East Side. 
 Gonna head over there now. 
 I'm not heading anywhere. 
 I got called back to court. Can't your people get their ducks in a row? 
 It's my third round with the same grand jury. 
 Maybe they can't get enough of your pretty face. 
 You just start the canvass, I'll try to catch up, all right? Yeah. 
 Can I ride along? 
 No. 
 But what you can do is accidentally bump into my partner while she's down there, okay? 
 See how the real pros work. 
 Take it easy, all right? 
 Thanks. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 NYPD. 
 You recognize this guy? 
 Oh, yeah. Sure. 
 Yeah? When's the last time you see him? 
 This morning. 
 Right here. 
 Yeah, very funny. In person. 
 No, just on the paper. 
 (sighs): All right. 
 Look, you might want to talk to this guy over there, uh, Dexter or Darrell. 
 He's kind of like the mayor of the block. 
 The guy in the hat? 
 In the green shirt. 
 All right, thank you. 
 Yo, Darrell! 
 (horn honking) 
 What? 
 Relax. What's your problem? 
 Darrell, NYPD. 
 Yo! Excuse me, sir. 
 Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Hey, hey, you know this guy? 
 Yeah, I know him. 
 You kill this guy? 
 No! I knew him. That's all. 
 Why you running, then? 
 My parole officer, she found violations in, like, I blink my eyes. 
 If she found out that I got questioned about a guy who got killed... All right, calm down. Calm down. 
 You're not in trouble; just answer my questions. 
 Forget about her. 
 He comes by sometimes two, three times a week. 
 Drives a Range Rover-- expensive, you know? 
 A while back, we made a little deal: he flip me a 20, and I watch his car. 
 You watch his car-- the one that has all the tickets? 
 You're a great lookout. 
 He-he don't care about tickets. 
 I'm watching for tow trucks. 
 All right, when was the last time you saw him? 
 Yesterday around 6:00. 
 What building? 
 344. Apartment 1-B. 
 1-B. Why do you know 1-B when you're watching his car? 
 'Cause he said if the tow truck come, buzz 1-B. 
 (siren whoops) 
 How long does it take him to come out? 
 I don't know. I had to have dinner at my mother's at 8:30. 
 You go to your mom's for dinner. 
 (siren whoops) 
 Okay, okay. 
 No, no, just relax. Relax. 
 Officer, come babysit my friend here. 
 One of you come with me. 
 JACKIE: Just chill out. 
 Farragaut was here yesterday. 
 1-B. 
 Hey. Perfect timing. 
 We're in here now. 
 Can you open the door for us, sir? 
 It was a girl, young, in her 20s. 
 What's her name? 
 I'm not good with names; I call them all honey. 
 But I thought I heard fighting coming from there when I was having my dinner last night. 
 And what'd you do? 
 It was dinner. 
 When I was finished, it had already stopped. 
 You know the signs... you see something, you say something. 
 (sighs) 
 That's about terrorists. 
 She's just a girl. 
 All right, move over. 
 (knocking) 
 NYPD! Anyone home? 
 Hello? 
 Coming in. 
 (door creaking) 
 Hello? 
 JACKIE: Hello? 
 Oh... pfft. 
 How old did you say this girl was? 
 Maybe 25. 
 (Jackie sighs) 
 All right, well, her clothes are gone, cosmetics are gone. 
 So is she, so... thank you for the backup. 
 Somebody liked little girls. 
 This is like a movie set. 
 Yeah, like  Gidget Goes to Hell. 
 Well, looks like Mr. Farragaut had a dirty little secret. 
 My God. 
 (sighs heavily) 
 Oh! Erin, go outside. 
 Yeah, this is Detective Curatola. 
 I'm at 344 East Second Street, Apartment 1-Boy, requesting an "A" run from Crime Scene. 
 {pub}We're here. 
 HENRY: Wow. 
 Why wasn't I invited? 
 LINDA: I am loving this dress. 
 Thank you. 
 Dad! Wow. 
 Guys, if you finish your homework, I rented  Waterboy. 
 Yes. Sweet. 
 I'm here. 
 Wow. 
 Why am I going to this again? 
 Because Tony Bennett is singing and because the new mayor invited you. 
 It is customary for a new mayor to review the standing commissioners from his transition office, not at a fund-raiser. 
 Maybe he wanted to get to know you better. 
 If Tony wasn't singing, I'd have passed. 
 And maybe he knew that. 
 Don't burn the bridge, Francis. 
 Erin, how's your friend Lisa holding up? 
 Oh, not so good, but her mom and both her brothers are with her. 
 What have you told her? 
 As little as possible. 
 All set, there you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow. 
 (laughs) 
 Thanks for being my date tonight. 
 You're welcome. 
 Although maybe it's time you both started seeing other people. 
 Just saying. 
 (car horns honking) 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Commissioner Reagan. 
 Mr. Mayor. 
 Do you know my daughter? 
 Erin. 
 Heard good things, many good things. 
 Congratulations on your election. 
 Well, on the shoulders of giants, not the least of which was our late, great friend Cole Farragaut. 
 That aches and it will for a very, very long time. 
 Yes. 
 Frank, may I have a word in private, please? 
 Sure. 
 Erin, it was a pleasure. 
 Have you spoken to Cole's widow? 
 I have. 
 It's the random acts of violence that are the worst tragedies of all. 
 Random, senseless. 
 A damn carjacking. 
 Where they didn't even keep the car? 
 Hmm. 
 Cole's family is going through a living hell. 
 The sooner we can dispose of this case and get it out of the news cycle, the sooner we can begin to heal. 
 So I got your letter of resignation. 
 Can I assume you will consider staying on? 
 Commissioner serves at the mayor's pleasure but not at his bidding. 
 I'm aware of that, Frank. 
 Just so long as we understand the difference. 
 ANNOUNCER: Please welcome Tony Bennett and Carrie Underwood.

 He wants me to rubber-stamp Farragaut's murder as a fatal carjacking. 
 He said that? 
 In so many words. 
 Which tells me that someone involved in the investigation told him about the girl's apartment. 
 He doesn't want to be burned by a scandal in his inner circle the moment he takes office.

 Thank you. 
 Tony and I recorded that for his 85th birthday album. 
 (applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (chuckles) 
 I see my old friend Frank Reagan over there. 
 By the way, my driver got a speeding ticket. 
 Could you take care of that for me? 
 (laughter) 
 (applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (chuckles) 
 (music playing) 
 (indistinct chatter and laughter) 
 Hey, Long Island iced tea, vodka, rocks. 
 I remember where I know you from. 
 Okay, where? 
 Stardust, back in the day. 
 Maybe you remember me; can't say I remember you or much of anything about the nights at that place. 
 See, if you can remember what happened at Stardust, you weren't really at Stardust, right? 
 Amen. 
 (laughs) 
 (laughs) 
 Thank you. 
 Listen, I'm going to meet this chick later. 
 She's gonna need just a little encouragement, if you know what I mean. 
 Anywhere you could point me in the right direction to score a little something? 
 Why would you think I could point you? 
 Stardust alum? 
 You see that guy behind me working his phone? 
 Yeah, that's a cop. 
 I never forget a face, and I can always make a cop. 
 Erin? 
 Lisa, what are you doing here? 
 At 8:00 this morning, I had two detectives at my house with a warrant to search Cole's home office. 
 They took his files, they took his laptop. 
 It, it's just procedure. 
 We're doing everything we can... 
 Kyle, my youngest, asked me if his father had done something wrong. 
 They just need to go through each and every detail. 
 Do they suspect Cole of something that ended up in his murder? 
 Not exactly. 
 He was my husband, you are my friend. 
 I want to know everything you know. 
 JACKIE: His records show Cole Farragaut  rented this studio. 
 The whole thing screams of love shack. 
 Well, if somebody else dug that up, why are we chasing the lead? 
 Well, word's come down from the PC that they want us to plug any holes on this case, so they thought it best to be going with family. 
 When my old man wants something done, he usually asks me himself. 
 I agree... something weird is going on around here. 
 Police. Open up. 
 Smells like teen spirit. 
 I know that smell. 
 Ah. Juicy perfume. 
 My niece wears that. 
 Whoever she is, she's one tough cookie. 
 (lock clicking) 
 (screaming) 
 Shh. Shut up. 
 Did Kiril call you? 
 I was calling him, I... I swear. Shh. 
 I was calling Kiril. Shush. 
 Just want to ask you a few questions. 
 Shh. 
 Almost from when Cole start seeing me, he talk about wanting me for his own. 
 He get apartment for us and he come to take me there, but Kiril found out. 
 How, I don't know. 
 Who's this Kiril? 
 Kiril my boss. 
 Kiril always knows what is planning. 
 Cole get angry and tell Kiril he does not have me to own. 
 You do not try telling Kiril that. 
 So what happened then? 
 First, Cole punch Kiril hard, like he is taking me no matter what. 
 Kiril strong, too, though. 
 They fight more. 
 Kiril wins. 
 Cole stop breathing. 
 I do nothing because Kiril will kill me, too. 
 JACKIE: All right. What's this Kiril's last name? 
 Kiril have lot of last name. 
 I don't know what one now. 
 Nikolina, where's Kiril? 
 I don't know. 
 You're gonna have to do better than that. 
 Probably back in Croatia, I think. 
 That's not what you think, Nikolina. 
 You think he's still here. 
 You thought Kiril was the one who sent my partner and me to your apartment to get you. 
 Now, Nikolina, tell me where he is. 
 I swear I don't know. 
 All right, well, I'm going to check with Immigration, see your status, and maybe that'll strike up your memory. 
 Please! 
 I not child. 
 I know all Cole want me for is for s*x. 
 But last day of his life, Cole try to save me. 
 His last wish was for me to be free. 
 Okay. I think we've heard enough. 
 Lisa, I'll try to hold her as a material witness until... 
 And then what? 
 Put her on the stand so every gory detail gets broadcast? 
 Have my boys live this out for the rest of their lives? 
 No. Let her go. 
 Look, it's a police matter now. 
 I don't care. 
 Let her go. 
 {pub}You're saying Lisa would rather see her husband's killer go free? 
 If the alternative is exposing him as getting murdered for his obsession with a hooker, then, yes. 
 Plus, the girl admits that Farragaut started it, so if we put Kiril on trial, any decent defense attorney is going to run with that. 
 So, you're thinking about walking around the murder charge. 
 I think I can indict Kiril on sex-trafficking charges, and with the right judge, get a comparable sentence. 
 You got the ammunition? 
 Nikolina named six other girls. 
 So, if I can get her and the others as cooperating witnesses, I have a case. 
 I see two problems. 
 One, there's no guarantee that Farragaut's relationship with the girl isn't gonna come out in court anyway. 
 So, you run the risk of looking like you're covering it up, and that's a hell of a risk. 
 What's the other? 
 When someone's murdered in my city, I kind of like to see the killer brought to justice. 
 (knocking) 
 Commissioner, Mayor-elect Poole is making a round of the chief's offices. 
 Scheduled? 
 Impromptu, apparently. 
 Should I invite him up? 
 Apparently, he doesn't think he needs an invitation. 
 Don't burn the bridge. 
 Well, there's something to be said for going out on top. 
 You're not ready. 
 Yeah? 
 It's a hell of a lot easier to put yourself in harm's way than it is to ask others to do so. 
 At least for me, anyway. 
 Play nice. 
 Erin. Frank. 
 I would have been happy to introduce you around myself. 
 I've always found it useful to, um, just arrive unannounced and dive right in. 
 Nevertheless, there is an etiquette to this office. 
 One that I'm sure you'll appreciate once you start running this city. 
 Well, I just wanted to commend you on whatever you did to keep the Farragaut case on track. 
 No commendation required. 
 My people are working with the DA's office to find and punish those responsible. 
 I see. Well, then, for seeing that it's progressed without any leaks to the press. 
 Well, it's not leaks to the press that I'm worried about right now. 
 I'm trying to find out who talked to you. 
 Frank, you know, I had a long conversation with the outgoing mayor about you. 
 He characterized you as having a problem with authority. 
 I draw a paycheck as the New York City Police Commissioner. 
 I not only don't have a problem with authority. 
 I pretty damn well define it. 
 Well, to some, yes. 
 But to others, Frank, you define a kind of white, Irish-Catholic, middle-class, last-century way of thinking. 
 You accept that? 
 As you are an African-American, Baptist, up-by-your-bootstraps community activist whose own polling shows deep gaps in support across racial and ethnic divides. 
 But still, I won the election. 
 Thanks for dropping by. 
 You have a good evening. 
 Can I have same-same? 
 Sure thing. 
 (crowd chatter) 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Hey. So, how did you make out last night? 
 Oh, pretty well, under the circumstances. 
 Yeah, sorry I froze you out there, but, look, cops make me tense even just hanging around. 
 No problem. 
 Good news, though. 
 The doctor's in the house tonight, and he's got some fresh Mash. 
 What's Mash? 
 Where you been, man? 
 Look, it's like blow and X got together and had a kid. 
 It's the best party you've ever been to, right between your ears. 
 I'm in. 
 Yeah. Me first. 
 All right, so, let me get this straight. 
 He kills a guy, a guy that you know, and you're just gonna go after him on pimping charges? 
 Sex-trafficking. 
 s*x... Look, it's still a prosecutor pleading down a killer. 
 It will carry the same sentence as manslaughter if I can make it stick. 
 Yeah, but did you speak to Dad about this? 
 Yeah, earlier today in his office. 
 And what happened? Did he throw you out of his office himself, or did he have his security throw you out? 
 I think that he is wise enough to see that a murder trail would only mean that Lisa and her boys would be utterly humiliated. 
 I don't see the justice in that. 
 I cannot follow you down that alley, Erin. 
 I'm not asking you for backup here, Danny. 
 (sighs) 
 Look, to make the trafficking charge stick, you need the girl. 
 Right? Jackie has been hammering her for hours. 
 She will not give up Kiril. 
 Do you really think you have a better way? 
 She won't give him up for us, but maybe she'll do it for herself. 
 (knocking) 
 Erin, we're ready for the interview. 
 (loud chatter and laughter) 
 (sniffs in, clears his throat) 
 (distorted speech) 
 Whoa! 
 Did you get some? Not yet. 
 Oh, back there. He's expecting you. 
 Um... 
 (clears throat) 
 You okay, man? 
 Yeah, it's just some ride, dude. 
 I feel like the back of my head is sliding off. 
 (sniffles) 
 (sighs) 
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! 
 What the...? 
 Get... Hey! No! PEOPLE: Oh! 
 No. Hey, hey! All right... 
 Get him out. Call 911. 
 Not for an OD. House rules. 
 Get him the hell out of here! 
 Hey, you're gonna be seated. Wait for a seat. 
 Excuse me. Oh, okay. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Ah. 
 Yeah, I need an ambulance, corner of 88th and Third. 
 Possible overdose. 
 88th and Third. 
 Make it quick. 
 Did he ever beat you? 
 What kind of beatings? 
 Hitting. 
 Cigarette burns to back of knees. 
 How much longer can this go on? 
 I think she knows what she's doing. 
 Those special football shoes. 
 What do you call them, with the things on the bottom? 
 Cleats. 
 Yes. 
 He'd put those on and kick you all over. 
 Do you know where Kiril is? 
 No. 
 You don't know where he is, but you know a place where he might go. 
 A club, a park, a friend or a relative? 
 No, I don't know. 
 You only go free if you tell the truth. 
 I don't know. 
 You can only truly be free if Kiril is off the streets. 
 You know that. 
 Kiril always find a way out. 
 No, not this time. 
 Is there a place where we can find Kiril, arrest him and make him pay for what he has done to you and to all the other girls? 
 (sobbing) 
 Nikolina. 
 There is a cafe in Astoria where they show Croatian football match by satellite. 
 (men speaking Croatian) 
 (grunts) 
 Get out of the way. 
 Kiril Farkas, you're under arrest. 
 Get up. Get up! 
 I want lawyer. 
 You'll get a lawyer when you're arraigned. 
 I know my rights. 
 Well, you have the right to remain silent. 
 Why don't you shut the hell up. Go. 
 {pub}Put him in the box. 
 I want my lawyer now. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Do you understand English? 
 Yeah, yeah, whatever. Give me his number, I'll let him know you're our guest. 
 JACKIE: Is that Kiril? 
 He is... is Kiril. 
 Is she back there? 
 That lying little whore?! Is that why you bring me here?! 
 Hey, hey! Come on. 
 You kill your boyfriend and blame me, huh?! 
 Lock him down. 
 Is that what we doing here? 
 Shut your face. 
 Okay, okay, I get it now. 
 Kiril have the Google; I know boyfriend VIP. 
 So, what, whore kills boyfriend but his VIP friends... 
 Hey, shut your mouth! 
 Shut up! 
 KIRIL: All right. 
 So, come on, arrest me! 
 Let's get CNN; I tell all about him. 
 Looks like we're down that alley now. 
 Okay, well, you're not. 
 I'm not? 
 I just arrested this guy on your charges. 
 What the hell you want me to do with him now? 
 I tell all about Mr. Big Shot Pervert Guy and his little whore! 
 Just put him in a cell. 
 Yeah? And then what? 
 Detective. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Agent Stark with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
 I have orders to take over custody of Mr. Farkas. 
 Immigration? 
 On what authority? 
 U.S. Department of Justice. 
 Mr. Farkas is being deported to Croatia. 
 Croatia? 
 Where they have an active warrant for his arrest. Croatia? 
 (chuckles): Okay. 
 Okay, I want lawyer now. 
 You'll get lawyer. He'll be waiting for you at the terminal in Zagreb. 
 No. No! 
 I have papers! 
 You can't send me back! 
 (shouting in Croatian) 
 I kill you! 
 No, no. 
 No, come on. Please, please, please. 
 He will stand trial in Croatia, is that right? 
 Yes, but not the kind that's gonna have reporters covering it. 
 Just a judge and a hangman. 
 The trial over there will never become public. 
 It's not the way I planned it at all, but... 
 But you know what they say. 
 You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. 
 How will you manage? 
 I have three boys who need me now twice as much. 
 It's not the time for hiding out or feeling sorry for myself. 
 But you will take care of yourself. 
 Yes, yes, by taking care of them. 
 (laughs) 
 Take a look at our Christmas card this year and let me know how I'm doing. 
 Deal. 
 Thank you. 
 You're a good friend. 
 FRANK: Well, with a strong background in community activism in a city as diverse as New York, you'd be bound to have some connections with Immigration. 
 I've made a few friends along the way. 
 Some of them in Immigration. 
 Good friends to have. 
 Apparently. 
 Well, whatever favors were done, Frank, were done for the common good. 
 Wouldn't you agree? 
 (sighs) 
 Well, assuming you don't disagree, I do appreciate the discretion shown by your department. 
 Let's be clear... I did nothing for you. 
 If you're returning my letter because you think I played ball here, you're misguided. 
 That's not why, Frank. 
 No? 
 No, it isn't. 
 Listen, I could, um, bring back public hangings to Washington Square Park and I'll still be labeled soft on crime, so that's part of it, sure. 
 But there's something else. 
 When I was a kid in Bed-Stuy, they would, um, lock up the hoop courts every weekend due to budget cuts. 
 But there was this one cop from the precinct who got a key somehow, and he would come out Saturday morning, open them up, come back and kick us out at the end of the day and lock up. 
 There's really no way you'd remember me, but I remember you. 
 And it was the first time that I considered a white Irish cop could be one of the good guys. 
 And that still goes? 
 I want you to stay on as my police commissioner. 
 Well... 
 Thank you. 
 Can I ask a favor? 
 Shoot. 
 I'd like to think about it. 
 Give you my answer Monday morning. 
 All right, your half- hour starts now. 
 Okay. 
 So, what did he say? 
 The mayor asked me to stay on. 
 NICKY: Wow, that's awesome! ERIN: Well, that's great news! 
 FRANK: Just hold on a minute. 
 I told him I'd give him my answer Monday morning. 
 Made him wait? 
 Yeah. 
 Get you, messing with the new mayor. 
 But this is great news. 
 He needs you more than you need him. 
 What is this, some kind of negotiation here, Dad? 
 No, it's a decision that affects the whole family, so I thought I'd give you all a chance to weigh in. 
 There are two of you... and soon enough, maybe three... who, like it or not, have your old man as your ultimate boss. 
 Or else, the guy down the street who throws a long shadow. 
 Well, that's never been a problem for me. 
 Oh, sure it has. 
 For all of you. 
 You boys never wonder if you catch a case 
 'cause of who your old man is? 
 When I was PC, if guys were letting off steam or shooting the bull about some gray area of the job, they'd clam up when your dad came around. 
 He felt outside the circle, 'cause of my position. 
 Never heard that from me. 
 You really think I didn't know? 
 Well, since we get to weigh in, I say better the devil you know than the devil you don't know. 
 (all chuckle) 
 Nice. He knows what I mean. 
 LINDA: Okay. 
 And conversely, I can always pick up the phone and get the PC on the line any time. 
 I know a lot of guys would be glad if you stayed. 
 Up and down the ranks. 
 You know what, let's just take a vote. 
 All in favor of Grandpa? 
 Francis, you can't abstain in your own election. 
 (sighs) 
 (all murmuring) 
 At the table, you said a lot of men would be glad if I stayed on. 
 Are you one of them? 
 I can handle it. 
 I voted yes. 
 Excuse me, sir, this pier is within a New York City park. 
 You can't smoke here. 
 I'm sorry, Officer. 
 How about if I just let it go out? 
 You have a good night, Commissioner. 
 Thank you, Officer. 
 (sighs) 
 Sure not gonna miss having a nanny in City Hall. 
 You are still the PC, Dad. 
 (sighs) 
 That bar you were working was padlocked by the state this morning. 
 That's a good thing. 
 And the guy you took to the hospital has been calling around, trying to find you. 
 He was? 
 How did you know that? 
 OCCB has a tap on his phones. 
 Okay. 
 What's going on here? 
 His father and his uncle are captains in the Cavazerre crime family. 
 He's a wise guy? 
 His record's clean, but nobody thinks that tells the whole story. 
 Whoa. 
 OCCB has tried to get inside the Cavazerre family for a couple of years, but with no luck. 
 My guess, when the time's right, they'll come to you. 
 With your blessing? 
 Son, I think you can do anything you set your mind to. 
 So, as your PC, sure. 
 (sighs) 
 But as your father...
