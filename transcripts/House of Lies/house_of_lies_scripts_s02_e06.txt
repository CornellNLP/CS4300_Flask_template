 Marty : Previously on House of lies... 
 U.S. national bank has requested a sit-down with a team headed specifically by you. Ah. 
 I mean, I don't have to tell you how valued you are here at galweather. 
 You are one of our stars. 
 My God. I have a 94% match with a shy Sarah. 
 Doug. (Gasps) That's your match? 
 When I'm through with the job, I'm staring at a boatload of cash. 
 And what happens when you leave galweather? 
 If you ever leave? 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 And you met your husband. 
 Yes, Kevin. 
 He's amazing. 
 He's smart. (Sighs) 
 I'm a... I'm a lucky girl. 
 To think that your boss tried to talk me out of hiring you. 
 Um... 
 My-my boss what? 
 Julianne (Over microphone): Enlightened leadership. 
 Team enhancement. 
 These are the hallmarks of the apex program. 
 Now, during our stay here, we are going to be hearing from some of the brightest minds, the most forward thinkers, leaders in the field of cutting-edge corporate innovation. 
 Simply put, this weekend is a game-changer. 
 The apex institute. 
 Galweather stearn's latest attempt at distancing itself from its sordid past. 
 So we pay these assholes a fuck-ton of our hard-fleeced money so they can sell us the same old antiquated bullshit about team building and leadership skills, repackaged as the future in corporate ingenuity. 
 It's all part of the "new ethics." 
 Spearheaded by this woman. 
 Julianne hofschraeger. 
 That wolf in Gucci clothing that tried to Judas me on the U.S. national bank consult. 
 Now, I can either stir up a sh1t storm of epic proportions over this, or... 
 I can just sit back and smile and nod, collect my riches, while she tries to convince us that we've entered into an era of new values based leadership. 
 (Horse whinnies) 
 Tallyho! 
 Julianne : It is a new era at galweather stern. 
 An era of responsible, values based leadership. 
 A time for us not simply to survive, but to thrive. 
 As a family. 
 (Applause) 
 Marty : All right, guess we gotta do this bullshit. Hey. 
 Come on. Let's go get the boy wonder. 
 I was wondering if you were gonna show up. 
 Well, you can stop wondering. 
 You okay? 
 Do you really want to hear about it? 
 I didn't think so. 
 Am I bleeding? Are you all right? 
 Feel like... 
 Punched you in the face. 
 Went right in the face. 
 Doug : Yeah! Oh, God, yeah! 
 (Doug moans, bedsprings creaking) 
 Oh... my God. 
 Yeah, okay, there is it. 
 (Gasps) 
 Doug : That's... 
 (Laughs) What is that? 
 He is definitely m*st*rb*t*ng. 
 (Woman moans) What, with a split personality? 
 Maybe... 
 Sounds like... 
 (Doug groaning loudly) Doug? Oh, Doug. 
 Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug! 
 Doug? Doug! Okay, what? 
 Jesus, Doug. Doug: Jesus Christ. 
 How the f*ck did you get this room? 
 I, um, house-sat for Pam the events coordinator last weekend. Who cares, who cares about the room, okay? 
 What? 
 Is your girlfriend here? 
 Doug does not have a girlfriend. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Sarah. I met her in San Diego. Marty, I talk about her all the time. 
 It just doesn't ring a bell. 
 So she's here? 
 Mm-hmm. Well, let's meet it. 
 "It"? Her... she... is, um... 
 No way. 
 (Laughing): No way. 
 She is... (Clears throat) 
 She's indisposed at the moment. 
 Another time. 
 We have no problem waiting. 
 I don't know. 
 Well, he has a sitting area. 
 An actual f*cking sitting area... Okay. No. Hey, Jeannie. 
 Hey, hey! No! 
 (Talking over each other) 
 Guys! No! I don't... 
 Oh. Hey. 
 Okay. 
 Shut the f*ck up. 
 (Giggles) Hi. 
 This is the pod. 
 Yeah. 
 This is great. 
 Finally get to meet the pod. Yeah. 
 Right. 
 Not at all awkward. 
 (Sighs) 
 To do that. 
 I'm sorry. Um... 
 Yeah, you know what? Um... 
 This is Marty, and Clyde. 
 I'm Clyde. It's very nice to meet you. Oh! 
 Oh! Oh, my goodness. 
 That's a weird style got a towel on. 
 Of shaking hands. 
 And, um, Jeannie, of course. 
 Jeannie. 
 Always outside our door when we've had s*x. 
 (Laughs) 
 Does feel like that, doesn't it? 
 How does that work? 
 It's... 
 So... So. So... 
 Why don't you get scrubbed up and let's go sit in the stupid-ass lotus position? 
 Yeah. I will. I'm coming. 
 Right behind you. 
 (Giggles) I heard it as I was saying it. 
 I heard it as well. 
 (Laughing) 
 Um... 
 Uh... 
 So... oh, yes. Yes. Very nice to meet all of you. 
 It was so nice to meet you, Sarah. Okay, yeah, we covered that, Clyde. 
 And, Doug? 
 Yeah? 
 You sound like a foghorn when you come. 
 (Laughing) Go. 
 (Clyde imitating foghorn): Hee-haw! Hee-haw! 
 Hee-haw... Get off of me. f*ck you. 
 Marty : Like if the queen Mary got a donkey  stuffed into its foghorn. 
 Well, she wants to f*ck you. 
 Hmm? 
 No... 
 Hmm? 
 No. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Okay, hello, everyone. 
 Or should I say... 
 "Na-mayste." 
 Nah, I wouldn't say that. Doug: Hey, guys. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Had to change the sheets, if you know what I mean. 
 This is exciting, isn't it? 
 Dr. day is a God in the field of mindful meditation. 
 The man doesn't get out of bed for less than six figures. 
 Ooh, he sounds great. 
 He sounds lazy. 
 So... head on out. 
 We're gonna meditate! 
 "Na-mayste." 
 Yes. "Na-mayste." 
 "Na-mayste." 
 Oh, hey, Marty, can I...? 
 Just for a sec, just for a sec. 
 So, um... 
 I wanted to, uh, check in, see how everything is going with brynn and U.S. national. 
 Great. Yeah, I think brynn is... 
 Very satisfied. 
 Great. 
 Were there some concerns? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Honestly, I was just, I was just checking in. 
 I'm sure you're gonna knock it out of the park for us. 
 Well, thank you for that vote of confidence. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, wait! 
 Wait, wait. 
 Really exciting news. 
 We dug deep in the coffers and we were able to get Malcolm gladwell. 
 No! 
 Seriously. 
 Wow. He is going to fly in this afternoon to speak to the partners about choice and happiness. 
 That is awesome. 
 f*ckin' a, huh? (Laughs) Right. 
 It's great. Yeah, it's unbelievable. 
 I wish I could be here for it. 
 Do you have someplace more important that you have to be? 
 Well, not... 
 Look, my kid... 
 It's performing arts day at his school, and I gotta... 
 In Los Angeles? 
 Yeah. 
 Wh... 
 I mean, th-that's a two hour drive each way. 
 Uh, if I'm lucky. 
 I mean, it is Los Angeles, you know. 
 Marty... 
 You kn... 
 This weekend, um... 
 This seminar, this is really important for the future of this company. 
 Yeah. 
 Your future. 
 Mm. 
 Don't you think that you should be here for all of it? 
 I mean... I would love to, and I wish there were two of me-- a lot of people do-- but I made a promise to my son, so... 
 Oh... look. I cannot tell you the number of dance recitals and soccer games that I have missed over the years. 
 And I-I still think I am a pretty good parent. 
 I'm sure you do. 
 Are. 
 You know what? 
 I am confident that you are going to make the right decision. 
 (Tires squealing) 
 (Gasps): Oh! 
 (Clyde laughs) 
 Hey, Clyde. 
 Sarah, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I didn't even see you here, that's crazy. 
 I was just laying down for a bit. (Laughs politely) 
 Your body looks like you got burnt a little bit. Does it? (Gasps) 
 Oh, f*ck... You're right. Yeah. 
 Do you see, when you put your hand on... Oh, I got it. 
 Thank you. (Laughs) 
 Sure. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, someday we're gonna chat when I have clothes on. 
 Bite your tongue. 
 (Laughs) 
 So you and Doug met on a dating web site? 
 We did, yeah. 
 What would a girl like you, just hot as hell... 
 Okay. 
 Need with a dating web site? 
 (Giggles) Um... 
 They're a great way to weed out douchebags. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I get it. 
 No, that makes total sense. 
 (Laughs) Let me help you out. 
 Uh, actually, that's fine. I'm okay. 
 Thanks, though. Stop it. 
 You have such tiny hands... 
 Yeah. 
 ...And you have so much skin. 
 Oh, they're doing the job. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 Do you know what you really need? And it's gonna sound weird... 
 Oh, I'm actually fine. 
 Women always forget the cleavage. 
 The breasts always get most of the attention. 
 No, I don't think they do. 
 No one forgets their... 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Never forget. 
 Never... (Laughs) Right. 
 Your tits are like 9/11. 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. So I'm gonna head out. 
 But if you need anything, you know my room number, okay? 
 Um... 
 All right, nice to see you. 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 Take care. 
 You take care of your own self. I will. 
 Don't forget, okay? 
 Yep. 
 Okay. 
 (Whispering): Jesus Christ. 
 Gita, hey. 
 Almost missed it. 
 (Piano playing) 
 Hey, pop. 
 Hey. 
 I didn't miss anything, right? No. 
 Oh, that was wonderful. 
 So beautiful. Thank you, girls. 
 How about that? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, baby. 
 Mmm. Sorry I'm late. 
 I didn't miss him, did I? 
 No, no. He's up next. 
 Oh, sweet. 
 Gita : Mrs. Anderson's fourth-grade class. 
 (Chuckles) 
 What? 
 Huh? We'll talk about this later. 
 Oh, yeah, we'll definitely gonna talk about it later. 
 Okay, now our next group had their hearts set on "krumping" for you all, but although we're against any form of artistic censorship, we're also big fans of being respectfully appropriate. 
 So please welcome Roscoe kaan, Philip Davis, susie Ellis and Virginia prazar  doing a routine from pippin. 
 Pippin? 
 They're doing pippin. Why do you sound excited? It's a good play. Ben vereen. Yeah, I know who's in it. (Hip-hop music plays) ♪ Party on the wall, looking for a bad one ♪

Man (Over p.A.): Red, blue teams, head to the raft race. It's, um, who f*cking...? All right, who cares? Um, a guy with a dick with big granny titties. It's okay. Paper and at the lower left-hand side, what is it? A signature. Is there a movie  called big titty signatures? (Groans) What? Growling, hitting the board doesn't help, Doug, okay? Okay, time's up. Again. No! Come on! Serious? God, "Santa claus!" Where do you see Santa claus in any of that sh1t? "Saint," obviously, halo. Then what is this? These are big titties. Do you see 'em? That's hands together! Old grandma titties! Don't disrespect the hands. And then there's just like a document. It's a contract. This is the clause part. You expect me, you expect me to get the clause part? Saint clause. Santa claus. You're a f*cking idiot, okay? You're honestly the worst person I've ever seen in my whole f*cking life. You're gonna eat it out there today, oberholt! We are gonna win on that raft. Why don't you do some more coke, Francis? Never done coke a day in my life. What the f*ck is wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Get out of here! Don't tell me what to do? Hey, Doug. We're gonna win, dick. Hey, Francis. Don't say hello to Francis. You know what? Hey, just take the tape, guys. Wait. For real? Yeah. That guy's an asshole. He made fun of my hair earlier. Yeah. What? You have beautiful hair. Thank you. Let's go. Stop it. Come on. Go, go, go. Look at you. Look at them. Look at them. Yeah, they look like winners. Why are they trying so hard? Why aren't you trying so hard?! Because who gives a f*ck? Because we can win this thing! Being a team! That's what this is about. Oh, my God! This is you. You're driv... Don't be an asshole. Give me that. The raft's almost done. We're almost finished, oberholt. You getting nervous, asshole? What's your f*cking problem, Francis? My f*cking problem is you and your pod walk around like you're the sh1t. Not so much the sh1t when Marty kaan's not around to hold your hand, are ya?! (Laughs) Finished! It's done! Yes! sh1t! Come on. Keep going. Keep going. f*ck it, let's go. No, no, no, no. We're not done. We have to secure the bamboo. The bamboo's f*cking fine. Grab that end right now. One, two, three, up. You better row like a f*cking champion out there, Doug. What? Me? When was that decided? Did you or did you not row crew at Harvard? Well, as second alternate. I never made it out of the rowing tanks. Now is your f*cking chance. I don't know. I feel like we have an unfair advantage. Doug, Doug, will you be a team player for once in your f*cking life?! What did you...? Me? I'm always a team player! Doug, get in the f*cking raft! Get in the f*cking raft! Okay, okay, yeah. Go! Ready? Up. Pop it in there. Get the hell out of there. Go, go, go, go, go! f*ck. Let's go. Let's go. No way. Uh-uh, no f*cking way. That is not stable. Go, goddamn it! All right, all right, all right! All right, here we go. Jeannie, don't push me. Doug, right now. I got it. I got it. Give me the oar. Give me the oar! Oh, God! Oh, my God, oh, my God! 
 
 (Crowd shouting) Nice shorts. Hey, man, f*cking second place, asshole. Yeah, Doug! Huh?! (Overlapping shouting) Stop smiling. Just go! Oh, my God! I got this, man, I got this! You got it, Doug. Let's go, Dougie. Doug! Doug! (Gasps) f*ck you, oberholt! Doug? Doug? Help me! I can't swim! I can't swim! Do something! (Yells) You f*cking losers! We win! Oh, my God. (Crowd cheering) You're a big f*cking idiot, Doug. It's that shallow? Ooh, God, is the heating on? Ugh! Take it, just get it all off. Yeah, can you...? I've got it, yeah. You know, it's my fault really if you think about it. I should have just been honest with them, you know? Yeah, they they wouldn't have bullied you into doing it. Bullied? What? I don't think I was exactly bullied. Really? So, what, you volunteered? Even though you don't know how to swim? Well, no. Come on. It's a little more complicated than that. Oh, sounds like it. You're gonna be late for your party. Our party. Yeah, I don't think I should go. No, it's no problem, honestly. I'm just gonna say you're a new hire. (Groans) I don't want to go, Doug! What? Why not? Honestly? Yeah. Because the people you work with are assholes. No, they're not. Yeah, and they don't respect you, yeah. And I don't wanna be around them. They... listen to me. They do respect me. It's a consultant thing. They kinda have their own way of doing it. Okay, well, I don't think they were being very respectful when they knocked on our door while we were having s*x. Well, in fairness, they did wait until we were finished, so... I'm sorry. And they weren't respectful of you at your... Boat race thing. I know. And Clyde certainly wasn't respectful of me when he hit on me. Clyde hit on you? When I was laying out by the pool. Were you wearing that, that sexy little pink two-piece? What the f*ck does that have to do with anything? Hold on. That's not what I mean. You just look so sexy in that thing. You do. And, and, listen, I know Clyde, all right? He talks a very big game, but I honestly don't think he would "hit on you" hit on you. Mm-hmm, okay. He offered to rub sunblock on my tits. Well, that's kind of like a handshake for Clyde. Oh, Doug. I'm sorry. I don't know why I do it. Honestly, you-you act like these people are better than you, and they're not. You're smarter. Well, yeah. Yeah, you're more handsome, okay? (Chuckles) You're better than them. And the fact that you don't see it kinda makes you seem like a putz. I'm gonna go get ready. Okay. Clyde : And what's gonna happen when the raft breaks? You're gonna start drowning. Hey, have you guys...? Hey, hi. Hey. Have you guys seen Marty? Why? Um, 'cause I want to know. Well, he's not back yet. Well, f*ck him then. Let's have a party! Let's get some shots. (All clamoring) Let's do one more! Gotta hear it. Give me one Marty b-school story. Oh, yeah. Come on. More, more, more, more. He made me a mix tape once. Marty made you a mix tape? Shut the the f*ck up. Marty kaan? Did you guys remember that song, "I swear"? Are you kidding me. Yes, or course. You know what? You know what? I bet he went to the all-4-one's version over the far superior  both : John Michael Montgomery. Oh, my God, I'm gonna make you a mix cd. Daddy! Oh, there he is. Marty! You guys seem to be having a good time. Tamara was actually just telling us what a sweetheart you were in b-school. I am putting all your sh1t out there tonight, honey. That's fantastic. Did you use to bring her coffee when she was up sleepy all night studying? Mm-hmm. How you used to go to poetry slams together. How you made her an admittedly flawed, but nonetheless thoughtful mix tape. (Singsongy): You loved Tamara! You loved Tamara! (Laughs) I got a little bit drunk. Yeah, we could tell. Yeah, what started all this? I was just saying how much this party reminds me of the ones we had at b-school. Really? Well, unless there's a keg of natty ice somewhere and Monica's passed out in the corner, I don't think this is anything like b-school days. Oh, okay, well, maybe I just wanted to reminisce. And now, I think I want to dance. Oh, boy. Marty, do you want to dance? (Giggles) Marty, come dance with me. Dance, Marty. No, no, no, not unless I get caught up with you guys first. Okay, all right, well, if you're gonna go to the bar, just get us another, um, a bottle 'cause we're empty, we're done. Get a bottle. A bottle? Mm-hmm. You sure? I'm sure, I swear. I swear! All : ♪ by the moon ♪ 
♪ and the stars in the sky ♪ 
♪ I'll be there... ♪ Oh, hey. Marty, just... Just checking in. Checking... (Laughs) So, uh, how was your son's recital? Oh, it was amazing. Was it? Yeah, really fantastic-- not to be missed. Y-you know what? So was Mr. gladwell. Ooh, he was brilliant. Great. I wish that you could've been there. Yeah, there's no goddamn way I can keep doing this. I'm sorry. Doing what? This, this passive aggressive bullshit dance that we do whoa, whoa. While you try to handle me. I'm not following you. I can't f*cking take it, Jules. I'm not foll... I'm sorry. Really, are you sure? Because you're a lot of things, Jules, but stupid isn't one of them. Okay. Is this about to be real? What you're gonna say right now, you're gonna hit me the real... The real straight talk? Marty. Bring it. You should know that this aggression... This aggression? This aggression of yours will no longer be tolerated by this company. Is that straight enough for you? Yeah. (Clears throat) (Laughs) Yeah, I'm sorry, it's, uh... (Groans) It's not gonna happen again. I so sincerely hope really that you mean that because together I know that we can do great things for this company. We all just... We have to know our place. (Quietly): Our place.

No, Doug. (Laughs) No, Jeannie, for real, honestly, please? Fine. Okay, all right. Sorry, uh... Oh, they have... Um... What, what's up? All right, so, I'm just gonna... Come right out and ask. Do you think that Clyde would ever, uh, hit on Sarah? (Inhales deeply) Yes, definitely. Why? Why-why? Because we're friends. Because... Doug? Oh, no, no, Doug. Clyde does not care about you. Clyde doesn't care about me. Clyde just cares about Clyde. That's... But you know that, right? Huh? Yeah. Yeah. (Laughs) It's Clyde. Right. It's Clyde. No, that's what I was saying. It's Clyde, classic Clyde. Right. That's what you were saying, okay. Water off a duck's back for me. Doug, there you are. Hello. Yeah, you found me. I was looking for you. I'm right here. You ready to call it a night? Yeah. I was just saying to Jeannie, let's get out of here. Mm-hmm. Okay, so, um... I can't find my purse. You lost it somewhere? Yeah, so I'm... You want to...? Oh, gosh, yeah, of course. I'll, uh, I'm on the case. Okay. Good night, Jeannie. We're not gonna have a problem, are we? Why would we have a problem? You know, your crush that you have on Doug. (Laughs) I don't have a crush on Doug. Mm-hmm, okay. I don't... no, Sarah, I do not have a cru... I am not at all interested in-in Doug. Great, so just leave it there. Yeah. Okay. And we won't have any problems. Correct, correct. Great, then have a good night. The f*ck is happening tonight? I tell everybody in the office. Ask this guy right now-- Doug? No, you don't. Haven't I always said that zanna's the hottest girl in the office? And then he says... No, no, he says he'd let you blow him if you lost ten pounds. That's a joke, that's a joke. Wha...? That's... he's just kidding around. Well, thank you, Doug. Sorry. Zanna? Why would you have to lose weight to blow me? Doug? What the f*ck was that? I would like to know why you don't respect me, Clyde. I don't know, maybe it's 'cause you're a f*cking cockblock? No, no, no, I mean it. A real answer. Why don't you respect me? Are you being serious? Yeah. All right, here it comes, Doug. This is what you want-- Doug, I respect you. Then why would you hit on my girlfriend? Is that what this is about? Doug, I'm not trying to steal your f*cking girlfriend. Yeah, because you couldn't steal my girlfriend. Aw... I... I can, I can if I wanted to. You know, Clyde, most people here think that you're just a selfish asshole. But not me, I've never thought that-- you know what I think? I think that you're a sad, deeply insecure little man, who has to tear people down just to feel better about himself. I do think that you are a good person, but I feel truly sorry for you. (Quietly): Yeah. Is this what you're like when you start getting laid, man? 'Cause honestly I don't like it. Well, I do. I really do. And if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go and f*ck my really hot girlfriend. I'm saying you look good out there, girl. Oh, am I taking you back? Maybe, I still got the moves. Mm, have you tried the jacuzzi in your room yet? You do not have a jacuzzi in your room. Yes, are you... f*ck. You jealous? Well, I'm not gonna be sleeping in a room that doesn't have a jacuzzi, I'll tell you that, goddamn... Mm. It's just the principle of the thing. So where we gonna sleep, Marty? (Laughing) What's with you? Where you...? I don't know, tonight... The sloppy drinking... Uh, first of all, I'm not sloppy. Well... You've been off since you got here, Tamara. Marty kaan, are you concerned about me? Are you gonna tell me what the f*ck's up? No, I'm not. No. Not. Not unless you tell me something, something deep. Something dark. Something nobody else knows. Mm-hmm. (Clears throat) I'm leaving the company. What? When? I don't know. But I'm done with this bullshit. All this... Running in circles and this bitch trying to handle me. I mean, I-I try really f*cking hard just to-to hang in here, and make this sh1t work, but it's over, it's done. You know what I think? I think I got under your skin a little bit. You did. Mm... So that's my deal. (Exhales) So, Kevin decides to take this job in New York even after we promised one another that once the kids were old enough that my career would take priority. (Sighs) He hasn't changed much since b-school. No, no, he has not changed at all actually. So, what does this mean? It means as far as I'm concerned my marriage is over. We're about to close this area down. Thanks. Hey, what's your name again? Amy. Amy. Have you been in the jacuzzis in these rooms? As far as my bosses know, I have not. Oh! You're a bad girl, Amy. Oh, Amy. What about tonight-- you want to, um, want to try it out tonight-- I mean, it's open invitation. (Laughs) What? And frightened Marty runs away. You're such a pussy. How am I pussy for... Trying to have a three-way. (Scoffs) Ah, f*ck. ♪ Bitch, sit on a dick ♪
