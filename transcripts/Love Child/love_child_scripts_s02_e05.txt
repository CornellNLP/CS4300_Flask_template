 Who's she? 
 That's Annie. 
 Wow. 
 Do you think I'd be OK as a dad? 
 I think you'd be a great dad. 
 Then help me? 
 We're here to discuss the future of James. 
 I was hoping you might be able to come to some sort of shared arrangement. 
 No. 
 Absolutely not. 
 My babies! Where are my babies? 
 They were adopted. 
 At least tell me that they're together. 
 Yes, they're together. 
 Robert and I had a baby. 
 Her name was Jean, and she was beautiful. 
 But she died. 
 This is the right thing, isn't it? 
 It is. It is. 
 Come back to Sydney with me. 
 We'll work it out. 
 Are you waiting for your wife? 
 I'm not waiting for anyone. 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? 
 Now! 
 Why don't you bloody move! 
 When do we want it? 
 Now! 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Get back in the kitchen! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 Annie! This is no place for a child. 
 It's not safe. Please come away. 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 Please, come away, for the baby's sake! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 Thank you so much. 
 Thank you. 
 Morning, Doctor. 
 Morning. 
 Was he here about his grandson? 
 Yeah. He's very keen. 
 The baby's father put in an application too, didn't he? 
 Um, Jim Marsh? 
 Yeah, we were meant to have a meeting this morning and he failed to turn up. 
 Really? 
 He was supposed to bring me some supporting documents I asked for. 
 I'm sure there must be a good reason for it. 
 If you see him, can you tell him to come and see me by the end of the day? 
 Otherwise I'm just going to have to assume he's lost interest. 
 I'm sure that's not the case. 
 He's some kind of social agitator, isn't he? 
 Yes. 
 Sounds like he's got a lot on his plate. 
 How many more cases are coming from Melbourne? 
 These are the last two. 
 Hello, sister. 
 Who's that? 
 Lilah and her mob. 
 They look very happy. 
 If Lilah gives you one of her biscuits, don't touch them. 
 They're lethal. 
 Martha, you've been so good to me. 
 I don't know what I'd do... 
 I'm not a charity, but. 
 You're gonna have to bring some cash in. 
 I can't keep paying for everything. 
 While you're out looking for a job, you can be the shopper. 
 This should cover some of the basics. 
 And here's the list. 
 Hey, girls, guess what? 
 An advertising company wants to talk to me. 
 That's fab! What is it for? 
 I don't know. 
 When is it? 
 It's in a couple of hours. 
 But they're up on the North Shore and there's no way I can take this little bundle with me. 
 Nup. Can't. Working. 
 It wouldn't be for very long. 
 Ah... A baby... I... I can't. 
 It'd be an opportunity for me to make some money. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 I feel terrible even asking you. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I'm so sorry, Annie. I can't. 
 I just can't. 
 You're giving me weightlifter's arms, young man. 
 Hello! 
 Oh, look. He's got great colour in his cheeks now. 
 He's going to be released into the wild soon, maybe even today. 
 Exciting. 
 Scary. 
 Oh, you'll be great. 
 I'll be exhausted. 
 At least you won't have to spend any more time with McNaughton. 
 Pardon? 
 The premmie baby clinic. 
 Hello, baby James. 
 Has he been hauling you in every ten minutes for chats? Yes. 
 It hasn't been so bad. 
 You know what you and I need? 
 A good night out together. 
 Oh, man. 
 I will call you tonight. 
 Nurses aides are a crucial part of any nursing staff. 
 Your work will at times feel menial but changing dressing, making beds and running errands are all things which help ensure the smooth running of the hospital. 
 Sounds like Stanton House all over again. 
 Will that be a problem for you, Vivian? 
 No, Matron. Then there is the patient hygiene work. 
 You will be washing patients in their beds or perhaps in the showers and will assist in cleaning their dentures. 
 You will empty and clean bedpans. 
 And you will perform these and your other tasks cheerfully, and without comment. 
 Rounds? 
 Yes. Oh! Who are those flowers for? 
 Oh, just... no-one. 
 A bribe to get you through your mid-term assessments? 
 I'd need more than flowers for that. 
 When you're in the company of a doctor you will stand to attention and remain so until he leaves. 
 I don't mind about the attention thing. 
 Happy? 
 Stoked in my first job. 
 It is imperative all staff entering the nursery have thoroughly washed their hands first. 
 Babies are the most important patients you will ever attend to. 
 No, I'm still very interested. 
 It's just something... something's come up, and I was just wondering if I could come by tomorrow and... 
 Sure. Yeah. 
 Bye. 
 It's you and me against the world, little one. 
 Why don't you take her along with you? 
 Single girls with babies aren't exactly a good look. 
 You don't know that until you get there. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Well, I'll look after her. 
 You're working. 
 It's not like you'll be gone all day. 
 Hey, careful with that. 
 Is it? 
 No. It would only be a couple of hours, actually. 
 I'll just cart her round with me. 
 It'll be fun. 
 Jim. 
 Jim? 
 Jim! 
 I had an appointment. I've gotta go. 
 No, you're not going anywhere. 
 The social worker already thinks you are a ratbag. 
 Now, are you absolutely sure it was Mathieson who did this to you? 
 His paid help. 
 But was he here? Did you see him? 
 I didn't have to see him. 
 I slept with his daughter and I'm the father of his grandson. 
 That's how he does things. 
 If I don't go to this appointment he'll trump me. 
 I hate to tell you this, but... 
 ..he was there this morning. 
 I've got to go! 
 No, you're not going anywhere, Jim. 
 Have you looked at yourself lately in the mirror? 
 I've got to get the documents there to the social worker. 
 I will take the documents in to the social worker and, if... 
 ..if she still wants to see you, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
 Let's try and deal with these ribs. 
 Um, the social worker said something about you being single. Yeah. 
 I saw you with a woman at that rally. 
 She's gone. 
 Does it make a difference? 
 Well, it might. 
 Being married would help. 
 Yes? 
 Shirley. Good to see you. 
 Dr McNaughton. 
 Can I get you something? 
 A drink? Cigarette? 
 No. Thank you. 
 Ben has been very useful for the study. 
 What have you learned from him? 
 He's got very good genes - 
 I can tell you that much. 
 I think he can go home tomorrow. 
 Wonderful. 
 This won't be the end of things, of course. 
 There'll be ongoing medical assessments, cardiologist's visits, various medications. 
 Of course. 
 We'll still be seeing quite a lot of each other. 
 So, um, is he still covered under your husband's medical insurance? 
 No. We are in the process of divorcing. 
 As am I. 
 Hm. 
 Well, if you'd like some assistance, I could go through the options available to you, payment plans and so on. 
 We could get together this evening and discuss it. 
 I might be working tonight. 
 You're not feeling, er, uncomfortable about things, are you? 
 Not at all. 
 Because I very much enjoyed your company. 
 In fact, if you like, we... uh, we could make it ongoing. 
 Ongoing? 
 Or casual, if that suits you. 
 Eleanor, Jim Marsh had an accident at work. 
 That's why he couldn't make his appointment. 
 He could have rung. 
 He fell off a wall. 
 Is he alright? 
 He's very sore but he should be better in a day or two. 
 48 hours. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, here are all the documents you wanted. 
 Blood tests results showing the high likelihood of his being the biological father, a letter from the mother telling him he is the father, and a statutory declaration from me. 
 From you? Yes. The mother told me she wanted Jim to raise the child. 
 He realises that his case is still poor? 
 Yes, but he is the father. 
 The grandfather can prove a direct biological link. 
 He's also had experience raising a child and he has plenty of money behind him. 
 Why are you taking such a personal interest in this? 
 I made a promise to the mother, and Jim is... a friend. 
 OK. 
 Uh, what does Mummy do? 
 Hey, I thought we had an agreement, didn't we, eh? 
 That you wouldn't cry? 
 Oh, don't do that, eh? OK, OK. 
 Where's Annie? 
 She's out. I'm doing her a favour. 
 You're doing brilliantly. 
 Full marks. 
 No, Shirl, can you...? 
 Where do we find the empties, mate? 
 Uh, just give me a sec. 
 Shirley? Shirley. 
 Alright, come on. Come on down. 
 Yeah, that's the way. 
 That's the girl. 
 Just there. 
 Yeah, no more crying. 
 You still running a book? 
 Who's asking? 
 What can you get me on Big Dancer in the third at Randwick? 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Listen, what are you offering at Big Dancer in the third? 
 How much you need for those odds? 
 No, come on, you can do better than that. 
 What are you offering Jeff? 
 There we go. 
 They will find her. 
 You know they will. 
 No, she could be anywhere! 
 Anyone could have taken her! 
 I've checked four blocks and no-one's seen anything. 
 What kind of an idiot leaves a baby in an alleyway? 
 I know. I'm so sorry! 
 I wasn't thinking! 
 She's a baby! 
 I know, I know! 
 And that's why it'll be OK. 
 Who would steal a baby? 
 You hate nursing already, don't you? 
 Did Matron make you do bedpans? 
 Do you still think about your baby boy? 
 If he's happy? 
 If he still lives in Sydney? 
 What his name is? 
 What he looks like now? 
 I did, but I don't anymore. 
 You can't. 
 I don't know how to stop. 
 Put it in a box, close the lid, and lock it. That's the only way. 
 Trust me - that pain will eat you up inside. 
 Martha! 
 Aren't you even going to read the card? 
 No need to. 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 Please, can you tell me - will I ever have children? 
 Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 Dr McNaughton? Yes? 
 I'm Patricia Saunders. 
 I was at Stanton House. 
 The... stillbirth. Yes. Of course. 
 How are you? 
 Sorry to disturb you, but I just wanted to give you a present. 
 It's... it's chocolates. 
 Oh. Well, thank you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Thank you for being so kind and understanding about Jean, my baby. 
 You gave her a name? 
 That's... that's good. 
 That's all. 
 So did I do something that killed my baby? 
 Something that I didn't realise would be bad, like, I don't know, but maybe I could do it again to other people's babies without meaning to? 
 Do you think that I'm cursed? 
 I don't believe in curses, and neither should you. 
 I never used to. 
 Often we just don't know why this happens and you should remind yourself that. 
 This was an idiopathic death. 
 There was no discernible cause. 
 Anyway... 
 I have to go. 
 Oh. Hard day for some. 
 Uh? Oh. 
 I did the shopping like you asked. 
 What's this? 
 I asked for basics! 
 I know it doesn't look like much but I lost that list and I'm not exactly sure what basics are. 
 Bread, milk, eggs, you know. 
 I did use some of the money to buy chocolates for Dr McNaughton. 
 He's rich enough to buy his own chocolates. 
 I'll pay you back. I promise. 
 Hey, how about next time you and I go out shopping together? 
 I'll take it all back. 
 Has anyone been looking for me? 
 What happened? 
 Deanna's gone missing from the club and I think someone's taken her. 
 Have you asked in the hall downstairs? 
 I came straight here. 
 I'll go. 
 You should have been looking after her! 
 I didn't want to hurt her. 
 OK, but... 
 Hey. You're worried. Fair enough. 
 But it's not Pattie's fault. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's OK. We'll find her. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 It's OK, little one. 
 Come on. Shh, shh, shh. 
 It's alright. Come on. 
 
 
 
 Pete! 
 Hi. This baby's been handed in to us. 
 Can you check if she's OK? 
 That's Deanna, Annie's baby. 
 What have you been up to, baby girl? 
 Bring her to the nursery immediately. 
 God knows what's happened to her. 
 Where is she? Where is she? 
 She's a very lucky girl. 
 Let me see her. 
 I need to see her and I need to take her home. 
 I'm afraid it's not that simple. 
 Your baby was handed in to the police by a good Samaritan who believed she'd been abandoned. 
 Is she OK? 
 I would say quick work on the part of the police has saved her. 
 Tell me why you weren't with her. 
 I don't have to tell you anything. 
 You don't seem to understand how serious this situation is. 
 You have no right to judge me. 
 You told me she was dead. 
 Just let me see her. 
 It's not me you need to convince. 
 You will have to prove to Welfare you are a fit and proper person to take custody of your baby. 
 They can't take her from me again. 
 They can, if they think her life is in danger. 
 Germaine Greer, do you think Australian men dominate their women too much? 
 'Dominate' is a strange word. 
 I think they're largely unconscious of their women. 
 They don't really think much about what women need. 
 Women capitulate to the male role in this society. 
 Men capitulate very little the other way. 
 And even in a dating situation, I've noticed, the men still behave in their normal way. 
 They still, you know, booze and natter with the blokes. 
 Oh, please! 
 They don't really pay much attention to the girl... 
 Working late? 
 I had to come back and finish off some stuff. 
 Annie still upstairs? 
 Who? Annie Carmichael? 
 Her baby came in before. 
 Never mind. 
 Just wondering if you got those flowers. 
 Nup. 
 Nah? Someone must have nicked them. 
 Dr Millar? 
 Mr Mathieson. 
 Eleanor. As we discussed, I brought the paperwork. 
 Come in. 
 I hope you're well, Doctor. 
 I'm doing better than Jim Marsh. 
 Why? Is he ill? 
 He's injured. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 I heard you were involved. 
 Jim'd blame me for the weather if he could get away with it. 
 When I met your daughter I didn't really understand why she was so afraid of you. 
 Now I do. 
 We're a lot like each other. 
 Willful. That's a reason for mutual respect, not fear. 
 I'm sure you have better things to do with your time than meddle in other people's business. 
 You didn't answer my question about this becoming an ongoing thing. 
 We could just see what happens. 
 Oh, you'd rather keep your options open, would you? 
 Yes, I suppose. 
 Has it, er, has it been difficult for you to move on without Johnny? 
 It has. Yes. 
 He was never a soldier. 
 I'm sure he was terrible at it. 
 Some distraction may be good for both of us. 
 Yes. Maybe. 
 See you later. 
 Forget something? 
 You're a surprise. 
 I was expecting to find my husband. 
 I'm sorry. I just tried it on because it's so lovely. 
 I'll take it straight off. 
 I'll leave. 
 No, please, don't go on my account. 
 Is it serious, you and Patrick? 
 No. We're just... friends. 
 I don't mind. Really, I don't. 
 I should warn you, though, Patrick's not very good at casual, whatever he might say. 
 It doesn't suit him. 
 He needs to be in control, the one in charge. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 I'm sure you can. 
 Are you planning on marrying him, once you move beyond friends? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 Being a doctor's wife is a good option. You should think about it. 
 He'll look after you, spare no expense to keep you happy, dress you beautifully, take you on exotic holidays. 
 I've never had an exotic holiday. 
 He took me to Hawaii. 
 Better than camping on the Herbert River. 
 Then I started having opinions. 
 He didn't like that much. 
 That's really none of my business. 
 But here you are, in my house, sleeping with my husband. 
 Your ex-husband. 
 Not yet. 
 Soon. 
 Are you fertile? 
 I don't think he could cope having another barren wife. 
 I have a son. 
 Of course you do. 
 I'm sure he's hoping you'll give him another three. 
 I really should get going. 
 You're not the first, you know. 
 There was a woman called Joan. 
 She didn't last long. 
 Maybe you'll have better luck. 
 Keep the coat. I don't want it. 
 You're gonna be alright, Deanna. 
 We promise you. 
 It is sheer good fortune this child is still with us. 
 Take these to the social worker. 
 The state this baby was brought in and what treatment has been required will help her determine whether or not Annie Carmichael is a fit and proper parent. 
 Annie can't lose Deanna. 
 Not for a second time. 
 The child should never have gone to her in the first place. 
 Martha! 
 Busy. Can't talk. 
 Hey, wait a minute. 
 Hey, I took a liberty with the flowers, I know, but... 
 Martha! Can you wait? 
 They're just flowers. 
 Girls like flowers. 
 Forget it. 
 Have I done something? 
 Yes! 
 No. 
 Look, I've had enough with blokes like you. 
 Doctors? 
 Rich white blokes. 
 Like the ones that took me from my mum. 
 Dumped me on St Bridget's Mission. 
 Blokes like you get what you want, and I know where that leads. 
 It's never good. 
 So, no offence, but no, thanks. 
 You're lucky Deanna was found when she was. Yeah. 
 You work at the Blue Moon? 
 Yes. I sing and I wait tables too sometimes. 
 At night? 
 At night, in the afternoons. 
 And who looks after Deanna while you're at work? 
 I take her to work with me. 
 To the nightclub? 
 Yes. But there are lots of people there that help me look after her. 
 Are they parents? Do they have any experience looking after children? 
 I've been through this before. 
 OK, I know how all of this works. 
 I'm her mother. I've got rights. 
 Deanna has a right to be safe. 
 She is safe with me! 
 Obviously not always. 
 Look, I'm not... I'm not going to take her to work again with me, OK? 
 And I'll make whatever changes you need me to make. 
 Just... just let me take her home. 
 Annie, hold on. What did they say? 
 They're taking her away from me. 
 Have you been out all night? 
 Here. I've been baking. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 That's very thoughtful of you. 
 That's an interesting cover. 
 Take it. It's all yours. 
 'The Female Eunuch'. Hmm. 
 You ready to come home, little man? 
 I can organise a cot through supplies, a change table, whatever you need. 
 No, I think I'm all set. 
 Thanks for all your help. 
 You're welcome. 
 You've been very kind but now that Ben's out of here, I need to look after him myself. 
 I'm more than happy to do what I can. 
 I know, but I need to be self-sufficient. 
 It'll be good for me. 
 I've spent too much of my life being reliant on other people. 
 I met your wife, at the house. 
 Oh, ah... 
 I'm sorry. I had no idea that she would be coming... coming by. 
 It was fine. 
 She was very decent, under the circumstances. 
 Thank you again. 
 It's a pleasure. 
 Been keeping you up? 
 Oh, no, Matron, not at all. 
 Just getting used to the bed. 
 I've got one of those horrible fold-out ones from Stanton House. 
 Stanton House? 
 Tania told me to get one and put it in the storeroom because there's no available beds in the nurses' quarters. 
 Tania is a ridiculous girl. 
 You can't sleep in a storeroom and then work. 
 You can take Shirley's old room for the time being. 
 Seriously? 
 That'd be ace. 
 Thanks, Matron. 
 You've got a good heart, really. 
 I know you do. 
 Room and board will be taken out of your wages. 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 What do we want? Liberation! 
 When do we want it? Now! 
 Yes? Come in. 
 Congratulations! Oh, to baby Ben! 
 I'll have a small one. 
 You are not allowed to become a hermit now. Yes, doctor. 
 I'm serious, Shirley. 
 You'll be a far better mother if you have a life of your own. 
 Speaking of which, where did you get to last night? 
 We had plans to go out. 
 Oh. 
 Got a better offer? 
 I was with Dr McNaughton. 
 He doesn't usually work at night. 
 It wasn't at work. 
 Did you sleep with Patrick? 
 Wow. I did not see that one coming. 
 It's done with now. 
 Ships scraping hulls in the night. 
 But why would you do that? 
 Same reason you did, I suppose. 
 Did he tell you? 
 No, his wife did. 
 Um... 
 I'm sorry. I'm very confused. 
 What... How did this all happen? 
 I don't know. He asked me if he could use Ben in his study. 
 That was a week ago. 
 Hm. Oh, so it wasn't even the first time? 
 Does it matter? 
 Yes, it matters, Shirley. 
 He's a manipulative liar. 
 He saved my son's life and he helped me. 
 I hope you didn't accept any money from him. 
 No! What do you think I am? 
 I told you - it's done with. 
 Maybe we're both great at making bad choices. 
 Cheers. 
 All I'm saying is that when you have a baby, you have a real baby to look after. 
 All those things that matter to you, all those things that are really important to you, you have to put them to the side. 
 Yes? I'm not saying you can't have fun. 
 You can have fun but just not too much fun. 
 Because fun and responsibility... they're... 
 Incompatible? 
 Hmm. Incompatible. 
 Have you drunk all that? 
 No. Go on, you have some. 
 No. I'm meeting the social worker in the morning. 
 Ha! Good. Responsible. I like that. 
 Oh? 
 That's good. 
 I just want to check - did you get drunk and come over here to lecture me about the baby? 
 Damn straight I did. 
 Dancing's more fun. 
 You have to be the right choice. 
 You can't run around the world, trying to save it, with a baby on your hip. 
 You know that's never going to work. 
 You know that, don't you? 
 I'm going to take you home. 
 No. I need to know you're the right choice. 
 Are you the right choice? 
 I am. I promise. 
 Cross your heart? 
 Come on. 
 Why are you single? 
 I find that very suspicious. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, I'm going to take you. 
 Oh! A ridiculous contraption. 
 Chris. 
 Chris can help me with this. 
 I need your help. 
 What on earth's happened? 
 I've done something bad. 
 You've hurt someone? 
 Yeah. 
 Do the police know? 
 They're the ones who found the baby. Baby? 
 This girl gave me her baby to look after and I completely stuffed up. 
 I left it outside. It went missing. 
 Everything in my life goes to sh1t, sooner or later, whatever I touch. 
 It's a disaster. 
 It's alright. 
 Annie Carmichael's baby? 
 Yeah. They're gonna take it off her. 
 It's all my fault. 
 I need you to tell me who to talk to to fix it. 
 You're still here, then? 
 Your first week must be going well. 
 I think so. 
 You're too modest, my girl. 
 From all reports, you're doing a sterling job. 
 Thank you for passing that on. 
 It means a lot to me. 
 I think you've impressed a good many people, especially with the bold move of taking a baby away from its mother. 
 Very courageous at any time, but especially when you're so new in the job. 
 But these decisions can go so wrong sometimes, can't they? 
 But if you're willing to put your job on the line like that, you'll go far. 
 Well done. 
 Wakey-wakey, Miss Women's Lib 1970. 
 What? 
 Oh! 
 I didn't see a photographer. 
 You were stoned. 
 What? 
 You had one of them biscuits, didn't you, one of them special ones? 
 I did not! 
 I do not agree with drugs. 
 See? Look. 
 Didn't touch it. 
 It was just the most incredible rally, Martha, and this book - you have to read it. 
 It'll change your life. 
 You sure you didn't have No. 
 Any chance you could take him for me? Just for an hour. 
 Working. 
 Shirley, I can take him for you. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, I can do it. 
 You deserve a second chance. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Morning. 
 Hello. 
 How's your head? 
 It's been better. 
 A bit out of practice. 
 How untidy was I last night? 
 Say, out of ten? Four. 
 That's not so bad. 
 Maybe seven. It was more like ten. 
 Oh, god. I'm so sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 It was the most entertaining night I've had for weeks. 
 You're here to see the social worker? 
 Yep. 
 Right. 
 Her name's Eleanor and she's a little bit churchy, so smile, be polite. 
 Also, I told her you fell off a wall. 
 Great. Thanks. 
 I had an idea about the whole single bloke thing and all that. 
 Don't bring that up unless she does. 
 Let's get married. 
 You and me. What do you reckon? 
 Let's get married. 
 I love weddings. 
 Do you love him? 
 Congratulations. 
 We can have him? 
 Stay the night. 
 I wanted to talk about the adoption of my grandson. 
 How do I get him? 
 Where are you taking him? 
 Matron, Stanton House, the board has decided to review that operation altogether. 
 You mean close? 
 You've got three weeks.
