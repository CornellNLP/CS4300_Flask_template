 This time next year I'm going to be in Melbourne with Robert. 
 You'll be back in Tamworth. 
 No chance. 
 When all this is over, I'm staying. 
 Stanton House? 
 In Sydney, you dope. 
 I had a couple of drinks. 
 That don't make me a drunk. 
 You can call yourself whatever you want. 
 I've never seen anyone as beautiful as you. 
 You're 22. Give it a minute. 
 My horoscope said I'd have children to an older woman. 
 I wonder who the lucky girl's going to be. 
 Johnny? 
 Joined up. 
 They said they'd waive my sentence if I put in two years of Nasho. 
 What if they send you to Vietnam? 
 I'll try not to shoot straight. 
 Help! 
 What's happened? 
 They're not taking my baby! 
 I promise you I am here for you and your baby, and everything's going to be alright. 
 Nothing happens in obstetrics and gynaecology without my say-so. 
 Those were my exact words. 
 It was an emergency. 
 When he sees the baby, he's going to fall madly in love with it. 
 Do you have a contact number for him? 
 I can call him for you if you like. 
 She's arresting. She's haemorrhaging. 
 Out now! 
 Seven, eight, nine... 
 Stop. 
 No! Get off me! 
 Seven, eight, nine... 
 Dr Millar, stop! Please! 
 "On 1 January, 1970, Gail died as a result of a postpartum haem... Dr Millar was fully aware of her responsibilities... Dr Millar did not make any attempt to alert... She proceeded without authorisation... It is my belief that the patient's death was entirely avoidable and was caused by the negligence of junior resident Dr Joan Millar." 
 Sorry. 
 Boss needs to see you in his office. 
 You've got time to change if you need to. 
 Viv, your mum's here. 
 What? 
 Since Viv has been here I've had time to think and take stock of the situation. 
 I've had some advice. 
 Vivian is still a minor. I am her legal guardian. 
 Once the baby's born, I'd like to take it back to Tamworth with me. 
 You can't do this! 
 Vivian, your mother is trying to help. 
 No! 
 With or without you, I'll be taking my grandchild back to Tamworth. 
 What's that - an admission of liability? 
 Yes. 
 I should have called for you in the first instance. 
 It was an error in judgment. 
 When are the board meeting? 
 This afternoon. 
 Do you think...? 
 Was there anything I could have done to save her? 
 Hard to say, since I wasn't there. 
 Autopsy might tell us. 
 You're going to have me stood down. 
 That's the board's decision. 
 They might decide to get rid of you from the profession altogether. 
 Struck off? 
 Would that be your advice? 
 Junior residents who think they know everything are very dangerous. 
 Well, that's that then. 
 Have you heard anything from the police? 
 About Gail's family? 
 No. Poor girl. 
 We have to look after her baby. 
 We know he has a father. 
 Gail made it quite clear she did not want her baby adopted out. 
 And yet she gave us no names, no instructions, no way of reaching her family. 
 Well, she didn't plan on dying. 
 The best thing for this child will be for him to be moved on to a good home as quickly as possible. 
 The father should be given a chance to have him. 
 And how do you intend to make that happen? 
 Excuse me. 
 The social worker sent us up. 
 You're adopting? 
 Yes. 
 Mr and Mrs Duggan? 
 That's right. 
 How do you do? 
 Matron Bolton. Mrs Duggan. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Would it really be so terrible if your mum took your baby and brought it up as her own? 
 Yes! 
 She could never do it on her own. It would be a disaster. 
 You're not a disaster. She brought you up. 
 I had my dad and my brother then. We all looked after each other. 
 What'll you do? 
 Go back home to Tamworth with Mum and the kid. 
 What else? 
 You were going to stay in Sydney. 
 Pattie, if anything ever happened to my baby because I wasn't there... 
 We can be mums together. 
 How's that going to work? 
 You're going to be in a big house in Melbourne and I'm going to be the town bike in Tamworth. 
 We'll all go on holidays sometimes. 
 Yeah, to the beach. 
 Our children can be best friends. 
 I've never swum in the ocean. 
 It's only a few miles that way. 
 Oh! It's loud! 
 A record player is a privilege much abused, like all privileges around here. 
 If you'll just wait in there, I'll go and deal with this kerfuffle. 
 My dad prefers the Beach Boys to them but my mother thinks their voices are unnaturally high. 
 Martha. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Do me a favour - you take him, just for a while? 
 Is he from the nursery? 
 Yes. 
 Is he sick? 
 Ah... I... 
 Please get him out of sight. 
 Take him somewhere... I don't know... 
 The Residents' Quarters, my room. 
 His name is James. 
 Is he from the girl that died? 
 Yes. Shh! I'm supposed to be working. 
 How am I supposed to...? 
 Joan! 
 I won't be long. My room. 
 Hi, James. 
 I had a baby like you once. 
 Key would have been good. 
 You're not Joan. 
 Wrong colour for a start... sir. 
 That's a very new one. 
 Please don't tell anybody you saw me with him, OK? 
 OK. 
 And we need to go to your room, sir. 
 Anybody could see us out here. 
 Oh, no, no. I don't think that'd be a very good idea. 
 Let's swing past the Oasis and grab Shirley and Annie and see if they want to come with us. 
 They might be working. 
 They might not be. OK. 
 Save our city! Save our city! 
 Hey, a demo! That's cool. 
 Save our city! Save our city! 
 Which way to the beach? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm going to ask somebody. 
 We'll work it out. 
 Save our city! Save our city! 
 Have you made any inquiries at all? 
 I've already looked into missing persons and there was nothing there. 
 Are you sure? 
 She might have given you the wrong name. 
 You said she didn't give you any documentation. 
 Have you tried circulating a photograph? 
 No offence, but it doesn't sound like she was too keen to be found. 
 She has a baby. It has a family. 
 Maybe she was a... 
 A what? 
 She wasn't a prostitute. 
 How do you know? 
 Young, hanging around the Cross... 
 I just know she wasn't one. 
 Look, her death wasn't suspicious, OK? 
 So unless someone comes forward, there's not a lot I can do. 
 Thanks. 
 It is so beautiful. 
 You got your beach wish. 
 Maybe that means everything else will work out as well. 
 It's impossible. I've already lost John Lennon to Yoko. 
 You are going to be brown as a berry, baby girl. 
 First swim of the new year. 
 Mm. Promise of things to come. 
 Like Johnny? 
 Exactly like Johnny. 
 Is he coming home? 
 Yeah, tonight. 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 Has it been hard for him over there? 
 Hard pretending he's happy to be in a war. 
 He's only back for a week. 
 Let's celebrate. Here's to Johnny! 
 To Johnny. 
 To you getting married. 
 To Robert, for saving Pattie from becoming a slut like the rest of us. 
 And to my next appearance on 'Bandstand'. 
 Pardon? 
 Excuse me! 
 Why didn't I know about this? 
 You star! Who are you with? 
 Someone exciting? 
 Say it's someone exciting. 
 I don't know. 
 Someone's pulled out so they've called me in this afternoon. 
 But I can't do it unless I have someone to look after this one. 
 Sorry, not today. We can't. 
 That's OK. 
 I'll find some hippie in the Oasis to do it. 
 You're my little secret from the showbiz world, aren't you? 
 Helen, I'm looking for Vivian and Patricia. 
 I haven't seen them, Matron. 
 I'm sure. Where did they go? 
 That is it. 
 I am going in! 
 Oh! Psst. 
 Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. 
 Ooh! Oh! 
 Vivi? 
 Oh! 
 Oh, Viv! Quick! 
 Is she alright? Viv? 
 Hey. 
 No. No! 
 If I die, who's going to save my baby from my mother? 
 Oh, Vivi, no, no. 
 Deep breath. 
 We're going to take you to the hospital. 
 No, I want to stay at the beach. 
 You can't have it here. 
 You're your own worst enemy. 
 Matron, please, you could tell my mother that the baby died, like you did with Annie. 
 I will do no such thing! 
 And then you could give her to people who will love her and take proper care of her. 
 Your mother is the legal guardian. 
 But if she thinks my baby died, then she'll go back to Tamworth and my baby can be brought up happily. 
 Why would you want to cause her such distress? 
 You don't understand. 
 You party girls, you think adoption is a form of contraception. 
 No! No! 
 Such astonishing selfishness! 
 My mother is a drunk! 
 You'll say anything, won't you? 
 How are the contractions? 
 Stopped. 
 "..the ulna articulates... of the humerus at the right-side elbow... 
 You took your time. 
 I'm... I'm... sorry. Where's Martha? 
 She had to go back to work. 
 Thank you. 
 James and I were just discussing the complex mechanism that is the arm. 
 Listen... 
 Would you do me a favour and watch him for a few more hours? 
 I have a few things I need to take care of. 
 I don't have work till this afternoon. 
 Thank you. I owe you one. 
 I always love it when the ladies say that, James. 
 They never pay up, though, mate. 
 Millar, I assume this is the baby Matron's looking for. 
 Please, don't put him back. 
 Please just give me a little bit more time. 
 Unless there's a medical emergency, no baby will be removed from the nursery. 
 He's not your plaything, Joan. 
 Jesus! 
 That's rich coming from you. 
 What did you say? 
 What are you going to do? 
 Sack me twice? 
 He has the right to know who his father is. 
 No more right than any other child born here. 
 You expect the entire system to stop while you deal with your guilt over his mother's death? 
 I mean, really? How long? A day? 
 A month? 
 His mother died because of me. 
 I owe it to her. 
 I have to try. 
 Please. 
 Viv, hello. 
 Looks like it's your turn. 
 OK, how far apart are your contractions? 
 Viv? 
 Hey, it's OK. 
 I want another doctor. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 Haven't you heard? 
 Viv's gone into... 
 What on earth's happened? 
 Viv wouldn't let me near her. 
 She freaked out. 
 She asked for another doctor. 
 She didn't trust me. 
 Viv was terrified before she went anywhere near a hospital. 
 It's nothing to do with you. 
 She knows you did everything you could to save that girl. 
 No, she doesn't, and neither do I. 
 Sorry. 
 McNaughton's going to get rid of me. 
 What? He can't. Can he? 
 Yes, he can. 
 I killed a patient. 
 You did not kill a patient. 
 The patient died. 
 And you saved the baby. 
 Don't you get any credit for that? 
 Patrick! 
 Delighted to tell you we've approved your funding for the premature baby treatment clinic. 
 Great. 
 Are you ready? 
 I hear it was a junior resident who caused this problem. 
 Yes. 
 Which one? 
 It's good to weed out the loose cannons. 
 What? 
 On reflection, the resident actually did follow procedure. 
 There's no case to answer. 
 And that's your official position? 
 Yes. 
 So why put this case on the board's agenda? 
 My mistake. Sorry. 
 Afternoon, gentlemen. 
 Dr McNaughton? 
 Excuse me, sir. You're required. 
 Hmm. Sure. 
 Martha. 
 Annie, hi. 
 You're not allowed back here. 
 Two hours is all I need. 
 She's just been fed, so she'll be really good. I promise. 
 I'm working. 
 I know. Please. 
 I've got a gig and I haven't got anyone else. It's an emergency. 
 No-one seems to understand - 
 I have a job, a real job, and not as emergency babysitter. 
 I know. 
 I'll be back as soon as I can. Mwah! 
 
 
 
 Shh. 
 Oh! Is Viv alright? 
 Yes. I'm sure they'll let you in to see her. 
 Why aren't you with her? 
 Do you know which bed was Gail's? 
 That one. 
 She had an Ansett bag with her. 
 Do you where that might be? 
 No. 
 Did she mention anything to either of you about her family, where she might have come from? 
 Her mother died and she had a step-mother she didn't like. 
 She said her boyfriend was really good-looking. 
 Anything else? 
 Someone was chasing her. 
 She really wanted to keep her baby. 
 I know that. 
 Oh, my! 
 Not a word to anyone. 
 How was 'Bandstand'? 
 It was OK. 
 Oh, go on! Tell me! 
 It was really exciting. 
 I think they quite liked me. 
 I remembered all the steps. 
 I sang in tune. 
 Of course they liked you. 
 You're fabulous. 
 Just as long as you're not working too hard. 
 I know how exhausted you are. 
 And you. 
 Are they working you off your feet in there? 
 Work's work. 
 Are the lips too much? 
 No. You look gorgeous. 
 Johnny'll melt. 
 I don't think I want him melted exactly. 
 What time does the plane get in? 
 About an hour, but I want to get there nice and early, just in case. 
 Shirley. 
 Shirley! 
 Shirley! 
 Shirley! 
 She's behind in the rent. 
 That cover it? 
 Oh! 
 Why is this taking so long? 
 Sometimes it does. 
 I can't... I can't do any more. 
 You can and you will. 
 I can't! 
 I'm so tired. 
 Please. These pain-killers aren't doing a thing. 
 Think of something else. 
 Like what? 
 Something distracting. 
 It isn't possible to think about anything else. 
 You know what it's like. 
 You've been here. 
 Oh! 
 I have seen many births, yes. 
 What did you think about? 
 Women think about lots of things - home, family. 
 Where's Mum? 
 In the waiting room. 
 Do you want her? 
 No. She was never around when I wanted her. 
 Now I can't get rid of her. 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Shh. 
 Ah... 
 Matron. Any news? 
 She's resting. 
 This one's going to be a journey. 
 You've had a long day too. 
 Have you had anything to eat? 
 No, I'm not hungry. 
 Join me for a drink? 
 We'll be called if there's any news. 
 Oh... Well... 
 I think that would be lovely. 
 This way. 
 Thank you. 
 Brandy alright? 
 Lovely. 
 Oh, thank you for taking such good care of my little girl. 
 I hope she'll leave more mature than when she arrived. 
 Oh, she's grown up a lot in the last eight months. 
 Cheers. 
 Do you have any plans for when you get home? 
 I'll have to get a bigger flat than the one I'm in at present. 
 It's just the one bedroom. 
 And you're a nurse? 
 Was. 
 Might have to get in that saddle again. 
 May I? 
 Yes, of course. 
 I just don't know how I ever suggested that Vivian... 
 ..give away her child. 
 You want...? 
 No, thank you. 
 You were probably trying to do what was best, no doubt. 
 Do you have children? 
 Yes. 
 I have a son. 
 Oh. 
 What's he like? 
 Self-sufficient. 
 We don't see very much of one another. 
 Oh, that's a shame. 
 Life takes us all in unpredictable directions. 
 It is hard, isn't it? 
 You make sacrifices that never get noticed. 
 Nobody ever wants to know if I'm alright. 
 It's all about the house or the kids or the school lunches. 
 You just... 
 ..go invisible, don't you? 
 Viv and I... 
 ..we'll be close now, now that she's a mother. 
 I have some duties to attend to. 
 Do you mind if I leave you alone for a while? 
 No. Of course. 
 Hey, that's Annie. 
 Turn the volume up. 
 When I was in labour, all I could think about was the first moment I'd get to see my baby's face. 
 Morning. 
 Who's he? 
 I think he could be the father of Gail's baby. 
 Really? You found him? 
 No, not yet. 
 So... 
 ..did you meet with the board yesterday? 
 Mmm. I did. 
 Are you going to have me drag it out of you? 
 Yes, well, um... 
 ..let's just say they were inclined to be more lenient than I was. 
 I've still got my job? 
 Looks that way. 
 You've obviously impressed the right people. 
 Maybe you haven't. 
 Maybe. 
 That preemie baby clinic I mentioned a few months ago... 
 It's been funded. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll be looking for clinicians. 
 Happy hunting. 
 Shirley... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I tried to catch you before but... 
 What happened? 
 He was in a tunnel. 
 There was an explosion, a mine. 
 I didn't want any more details. 
 God. Shirl... 
 I'm going to be late for work. 
 You don't need to go to work. 
 I'll explain. They'll understand. 
 Of course I have to work. 
 No, not today of all days. 
 For Ben? 
 It's just another day. 
 One day, Shirls. 
 One day's pay is one day's pay, when you have nothing. 
 Viv... 
 I'm here to help you... 
 ..if you'll let me. 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I should have been here earlier. 
 Matron looked after me. 
 Right, I'm just going to check the baby's position. Mmm-hmm. 
 OK? 
 Alright. 
 There's the head. 
 There's a foot. 
 There's another foot. 
 What...? What's, what's wrong? 
 You're having twins. 
 What? Wh...? 
 How can I? 
 Sometimes if the babies are positioned behind each other, we only hear one heartbeat. 
 I'm scared! 
 You're going to have to push, Viv! 
 I am pushing! 
 Then push harder! 
 Oh! 
 Come on. You can do this. 
 We're nearly there. 
 Alright, baby's crowning. 
 It's OK, it's OK, we're doing this together. Big push, alright? 
 Oh! Here we are. Ah. 
 Is it alright? 
 Is it alright? 
 Yes. 
 She's perfect. 
 OK. 
 We're not finished yet. 
 Come on. 
 I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 I can't. 
 I want my mum! 
 You can do this, Viv. 
 Mum! 
 Alright, big push, Viv. 
 OK. 
 Ready? 
 Oh! 
 Oh! Let... Let me help. 
 Actually, would you mind giving me a hand? 
 Prepare a nappy? 
 Of course. There we are. 
 It's alright. It's OK. 
 Hang on a minute... 
 There we are, that's it. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, I'm so sorry! 
 I'm just all thumbs lately. 
 Are you sure you're up to this? 
 Oh, I've done this many times. 
 But not with the shakes. 
 It creeps up you, doesn't it? 
 Before you know it, the addiction has you by the throat and you're not who you used to be. 
 Oh, I just need my daughter, I don't want to lose her. 
 I think that will happen if you force her to take her babies home with you. 
 Oh... 
 Mum. 
 I think they want me to stay here for a few days but it won't take me very long to pack. 
 There's no rush. 
 Twins. Trust me to make things even more complicated. 
 Are you alright? 
 Yes, just very tired, that's all. 
 I want to be a good mother. 
 I know you do. 
 These little baby girls of yours, they're going to be something in this life, if they have half your strength and your spirit. 
 Too right they will. 
 Look out, Tamworth. 
 You're their mother. 
 What do you think is best for them? 
 I think... 
 I think... 
 ..that we should let them go to people who will give them the very best chance of a good life. 
 Let's do that then. 
 Thanks, Mum. 
 And it doesn't... 
 It doesn't that mean you won't have grandkids, just... 
 ..not this time. 
 Deanna's still wide awake, as always. 
 Are you alright? 
 Fine. 
 If she needs looking after, I'm happy to volunteer. 
 I'll let you know. 
 We're running dry at our table. 
 We can't have that, can we? 
 I'll be right over. 
 I'll be counting the seconds. 
 You don't have to put up with that sort of thing, not tonight. 
 Nothing I can't handle. 
 What? 
 You want me to fall in a heap? 
 Sorry to disappoint you. 
 Can you just leave me alone? 
 No. 
 You want to help me, that's how you can do it. 
 Shirley, you have to talk about it. 
 What is there to say? 
 Johnny was a pacifist when I met him. 
 I was careless and got pregnant and he felt he had to sign up so he could look after me and the baby. 
 And that's what got him killed. 
 I'm never going to dance again. 
 Of course you will. 
 You'll be so much lighter on your feet now. 
 Not too much exertion. 
 Matron, thank you so much for bringing me that television set in the middle of the night. 
 Televisions are not permitted in the labour ward. 
 You must have imagined it. 
 Oh, maybe I did. 
 They gave you the good drugs. 
 Martha! 
 And thank you for looking after my mother. 
 I know she can be a bit of a handful. 
 I don't know what she told you. 
 I'm simply doing my job. 
 I had no idea how much nurses had to deal with. 
 Do you think that they might keep my girls together when they're adopted? 
 I'd like to think of them growing up side-by-side. 
 Hey. 
 Look. 
 Thank you. 
 Alright. 
 Oh, it's gorgeous. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm not leaving Sydney. 
 Is that right? 
 Do you want to go into the water? 
 Oh! 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh! Careful. 
 Welcome to Sydney. 
 Joan. 
 I know this man. 
 I saw him at the Save Our City demo. 
 If Greg Mathieson gets his way, this community will be demolished to make way for his high-rise monstrosity. 
 So today we draw a line! 
 Hear, hear! 
 Any builder, any employer that crosses that line will be driven out of business! 
 Yeah! 
 This is a green ban! 
 Green ban! Green ban! 
 You're a scumbag! Green ban! 
 Patricia... sometimes in the darkness... 
 ..the only light we can find is within ourselves, and we must find a way to believe, even when there is no hope. 
 Patricia... 
 ..I'm very sorry. 
 Just try it one more time, please. 
 Are you sure it's mine? 
 Yes. 
 This is no-one's fault. 
 No - get out! You get out! 
 Get out of here. Get out! 
 I hate you! Get out! 
 I love you.
