 Hey. Nice toolbox. 
 I have a high-impact Fully Gasketed JXL 50 myself. 
 Oh, it's not for tools. It's for my glitter. 
 Glitter? 
 Oh, my eyes! 
 Come on. Don't you scrapbook? 
 I use it to paint my shoes. 
 How about we rewind. 
 Hi, I'm Andi. 
 I live down the street. 
 Hi, I'm Emma. Nice to meet you. 
 Need a little help? 
 Yeah, sure. Grab a box. 
 Uh! 
 Well, look at that. 
 You got half a library in here. 
 Whoa. What? 
 What's the matter? 
 Nothing. It just... 
 Looks like this books is glowing or something. 
 Oh. 
 I think it was my mom's. 
 Ugh. 
 Okay, back. Everyone stay back. 
 My socks! Give 'em back! 
 No, they're stinking up the whole house, Mac. 
 Daniel, let's go! 
 Butterflies! 
 Whoa. 
 What's your problem? 
 I'm allergic to them.

 What are you doing? 
 I saw this really cute guy across the street with a sock on a stick, I felt butterflies, and then there were actual butterflies, hundreds everywhere, so I hid. 
 Oh, it must have been Daniel. 
 But the coast is clear. He's gone now. 
 Let's go, sharks. 
 Go get 'em in the tank. 
 Shark bite... - Sophie, go left. 
 Soph, I said go left. 
 I got confused. 
 How? We put an "x" on your left hand. 
 Oh, that's what that is. 
 Ugh! 
 It's been an hour, and I'm missing my spa treatment. 
 And what happens when I miss... A treatment? 
 Yeah. A cloud of butterflies. 
 In the middle of the street? 
 Yes. 
 But you're okay? 
 I think so. 
 Okay, well... 
 Robert. Melanie. 
 Tommy. What are you guys doing? 
 Nothing. 
 Oh, nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing? 
 So my automatic pancake flipper might have jammed. 
 I thought it was an egg launcher. 
 No more inventions. 
 Actually, this was more of a malfunction than an invention. 
 Whatever. 
 You're all grounded. 
 Again? What about my swim meet? 
 We'll find a babysitter. 
 We'll behave. 
 As always. 
 Oh, I'm late. I got to run. 
 Thanks for all your help. 
 It was sweet of you. 
 I'm working on it. 
 Where are you off to? 
 Oh, a swim meet. I'm on the iridium sharks. 
 Oh, I'm going to iridium too. 
 Cool. 
 Then I guess I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 Zap! 
 Mom! 
 Maddie, calm down! 
 And so it begins. 
 Finally. 
 Mom! 
 What was that? 
 Ah, must be some kind of el niño. 
 Uh, el niño's brother-in-law. 
 El cuñado. 
 Well, he owes me a new pair of shoes. 
 How many shoes can a 14-year-old possibly need? 
 399 pairs. 
 One for every day of the year. 
 It's Daniel. 
 He wants me to babysit those terrible three? 
 Everyone else has us blacklisted. 
 Terrible three, you better be good, okay? 
 Hello, Millers. 
 Thanks for doing this. 
 Well, this is ruining my plans for a spa session, but I'm sure your parents will reimburse me for it. 
 You better behave, okay? 
 Bye, Maddie. 
 Lip gloss. 
 Oh. 
 Right. 
 You better behave. 
 Or what? 
 Are they gone? 
 Where's Sophie? 
 She said she was going through the second floor. 
 There is no second floor. 
 Thump! 
 Oh. There she is. 
 Hey, girls. I made it. 
 What are you gonna do with us? 
 Hey, Danny boy. 
 You got a really great team. 
 Mac never showers. 
 Your best swimmer is a girl. 
 And the team Captain can't even take on a pack of butterflies. 
 That's it. I'm putting lead in his bathing suit! 
 Come on. 
 We win or we sink. All right? 
 Go, sharks! 
 What is going on here? 
 Oh... Um... Ah... Spa day? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing? 
 Uh, nothing. 
 I think there's something wrong with the house. 
 What do you mean "wrong"? 
 I think it's haunted. 
 What? It's not haunted. 
 Come on, em. 
 Maybe not haunted, but definitely strange. 
 Today I reached for the fridge, and before I even touched it, it opened. 
 The house is on a slight tilt. 
 Then I knocked over a vase, and instead of crashing, it sort of floated to the ground. 
 Look, sometimes when we get nervous or even scared, things can appear to happen in slow motion. 
 And then I unpacked a lamp and it turned on even though I hadn't plugged it in yet. 
 How do you explain that? 
 It's got batteries in case of a power outage. 
 Oh. 
 Everything has a logical explanation. 
 I guess. 
 What? 
 What was that? My parents are furious. 
 You were supposed to be babysitting my siblings. 
 You said to entertain them. 
 Yeah, I meant put in a movie, play a video game, teach 'em how to multiply. 
 Not give you a pedicure. 
 I'm feeling... Really unappreciated here, Danny. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 Keep this up, and we're over. 
 Keep what up? 
 That's it. We're over. 
 Again? 
 Hi! We won the relay! 
 Hi. And what... what relay? 
 At the swim meet. 
 Luckily all those butterflies didn't do too much damage on your little crush, Daniel. 
 Shh! 
 Relax, no one's listening. 
 Unless... Unless Gigi's lurking around. 
 Who's Gigi? 
 Oh, she's a school gossip. 
 Her nickname is Miss Information. 
 She has the most-read blog on our school website. 
 Check it out. 
 Gigi has a page for everyone. 
 Um... Him for example. 
 Tony! Okay. 
 Likes math, sudoku, and street magic. 
 Hates... Snow days, no homework, and arugula. 
 The Panthers. 
 If you want to survive in this school, stay away from them. 
 Really? How bad could they be? 
 Maddie! 
 How do you respond to the results of my latest poll? 
 Which poll? 
 About whether you're the most intimating girl in school. 
 55% said yes. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I'll be right back, okay? 
 
 
 
 Where did you come from? 
 I'm so sorry. I startled you. 
 You're... You're Emma, right? 
 How do you know? 
 I'm assigned to show you around the school today. 
 I'm Daniel. I know. 
 I mean, that's... Nice. 
 It totally is. 
 So, um, Emma, this is... Bless you. 
 Okay, this is... this is weird. 
 There aren't any, um, butterflies around here, are there? 
 No!  Why? 
 I'm allergic to them. 
 How allergic? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Okay, there's got to be a butterfly in here. 
 Um, well, thanks for showing me around the, uh, office. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. 
 How did you do that? 
 I didn't! 
 My smoothie! 
 Who are you? 
 Emma? 
 What was that? 
 Daniel, are you with her? 
 You're  my  boyfriend. 
 Ex-boyfriend. 
 Anybody notice it's raining in the hall? 
 Is this normal for Miami? 
 No, but pretty normal for Maddie. 
 Why is the hallway wet? 
 It... it rained? 
 Inside the hallway? 
 I hate when that happens. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine, but the new girl won't be. 
 Thanks for showing me around. 
 It's no problem, and I got out of homeroom and math. 
 I hate math, and the new teacher looks like a total snooze. 
 That would be my dad. 
 A snooze, that's slang... you know, fun, cool, sick? 
 That's okay. 
 I'll make sure to make fun of your mom when I meet her. 
 I mean, not that I'd meet her because you... 
 I mean, just like hypothetically if I ran into her on the street or something, and she was like, "I'm Daniel's mom." 
 And I'd be like, "oh, really? Cool, you're sick. I mean, sick in a cool way." 
 Okay, can we rewind back to... Well, back to even before we met? 
 Because I've been embarrassing myself since then. 
 Don't worry. 
 It's cute... awkward, but cute. 
 This is the cafeteria. 
 "Awkward, but cute," seriously? 
 Go away. 
 I didn't mean it that way. 
 No, not you. 
 I was just talking to... My... Self. 
 You're broken up again? 
 Not for long. 
 You always say that. 
 But one of these times, he might give that up. 
 Katie, take that back or I'll punish you like the last time when I turned your hair blue. 
 Ooh, we're rhyming. I want in. 
 Roses are red, violets are... Katie, why is your hair blue? 
 That's not a rhyme. 
 Oh, and your hair is blue. 
 You're both terrible at rhyming. 
 No, seriously. 
 Your hair... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Is blue. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What? 
 She shouldn't have used fruit juice to condition her hair. 
 So if I have 12 donuts, and 3 are cream-filled... 
 What percentage are plain? 
 Diego, what do I have? 
 A massive sugar rush? 
 All right, you're saved. 
 Don't forget a big test on Monday. 
 What? Wait. 
 You can't give us a test. You just got here. 
 Let me check the new teacher rule book. 
 Oh, yeah, actually I can. So study hard. 
 Dude, we have to study for this. 
 If our grades drop too low, we could be off the team. 
 So you play lots of sports? 
 Um, a few. 
 I'm Captain of the swim team and soccer team. 
 I run track and play baseball too. 
 Oh, just a few. 
 Oh, do you play any sports? 
 Does scrapbooking count? 
 Depends. 
 How competitive are you about it? 
 Oh, very, and I have the paper cuts to prove it. 
 Step away from my boyfriend. 
 I'm not your boyfriend. 
 Hi, I'm Emma. 
 We met earlier with the whoosh and the... 
 Nobody cares. 
 Maddie, you're being rude. 
 Right, good talk. 
 See you guys later. 
 Come on, Daniel. We can't be broken up. 
 It was just a joke. 
 You break up with me as a joke a lot. 
 Daniel, you're so frustrating. 
 You broke up with me for the last time, and I told you no more. 
 We're done. 
 Hi, sweetie. How was... how was school? 
 Terrible. We had a pop quiz. 
 Daniel didn't get back together with me, and then he showed this new girl around school. 
 She had on the ugliest shoes. 
 Oh, that... that's wonderful, honey. 
 And she spilled my smoothie. Well, sort of. 
 First, she froze it in midair, and then she dropped it. 
 She what? 
 She spilled my smoothie. 
 Not that part; The other part. 
 She froze it in midair? 
 Oh, that. 
 Yeah, it was weird. 
 Just hung there. 
 Are you sure it wasn't you? 
 Of course not. 
 Do you know where she lives? 
 Where are we going? 
 To welcome your friend to the neighborhood. 
 Why? 
 The last thing I want to do right now is see that boyfriend stealer. 
 Maddie winkie, you know what I always say. 
 Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. 
 You've never said that. 
 Well, I just did. 
 How was the first day? 
 Pretty good. I met a boy named Daniel. 
 He's really cute, but his girlfriend is a total psyc... oh, hi. 
 Hello, new neighbors. 
 Welcome. 
 You're Maddie, right? 
 I am. 
 And if you tell anyone I'm here, I'll make you fail lunch. 
 You can't fail lunch. 
 But you can. That's how powerful I am. 
 Hello, hi, I'm... I'm Francisco. 
 And I'm divorced. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Dirsula... Ursula. 
 Yeah, this is... this is my daughter Maddie. 
 Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you. 
 We brought you some fresh baked cookies. 
 They taste just like the kind you get at the supermarket. 
 Oh, well, that's because I'm an expert Baker, a skill any future husband might enjoy. 
 Hey, we were just about to order pizza. 
 Would you guys like to join us? 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 Yes, yes, we would love to. Go play. 
 Go play. Go play! 
 Oh, thank you so much, Francisco. 
 So is it just the two of you or is there a Mrs. Francisco? 
 There was. 
 She passed away when Emma was born. 
 Awkward - I'm so sorry. 
 So was your mother much of a reader? 
 Well, yes, actually. 
 We still have a lot of her books. 
 Books? Wow, we would to see some... 
 Okay, we just passed awkwardtown, and now we're at creepyville. 
 We got to go. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Call me. 
 Okay. 
 What now? 
 It's Maddie. 
 Don't worry. She won't distract us. 
 Ooh, where is Daniel? 
 Maybe he's with, uh... new girl. 
 I'm adding her to my dislike list. 
 She better stay away from Daniel. 
 He is mine. 
 So what do you want to do tonight? 
 Oh, you know, just the usual sleepover stuff. 
 Boxing, 'cause... 
 I... I mean, it's your house so you choose what we do first. 
 Never let Emma choose our sleepover activities. 
 You know who came over today? 
 The glitter fairy? 
 No. 
 Maddie and her mom. 
 What did they want? 
 I don't know. 
 Maddie's mom kept asking me these weird questions. 
 Then they left in a rush. 
 Where did I leave the brush? 
 Guys, focus. We have to focus. 
 We can't focus with Maddie texting you every five seconds. 
 Okay, I'll turn my phone off. 
 Problem solved. 
 Okay, if something else moves, I swear I'm running home. 
 It's okay. Just think happy thoughts. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Great white sharks, zombies, hockey games, my toolbox, more zombies... - those are not happy thoughts. Think. 
 Glitter, balloons, sweetarts, rainbows, puppies, and pink hearts. 
 Cute, you even did a little rhyme there. 
 Oh, what was that? 
 Oh, that's kind of nice. 
 What is this? 
 What was that? 
 I'm not sure, but my great-grandmother used to tell me these stories about... 
 About what? 
 Witches. 
 Witches. 
 And you believed her? 
 Do you have a better explanation for any of this? 
 Yes. 
 There's a... And it's... And then that makes... Voila. 
 Oh, yeah, that makes way more sense than what I said. 
 Look, you wished for all those hearts, and they appeared. 
 Exactly how grammy gram described. 
 Come on. Do you really think I'm a... 
 Yup, you're a witch.
