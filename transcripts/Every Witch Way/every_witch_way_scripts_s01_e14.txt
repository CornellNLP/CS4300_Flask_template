 What are you doing up here? 
 Relaxing with my favorite magazine, "teen vog-oo-ee." 
 Why'd you call out for me? 
 I ran out of iced tea. 
 Would you be a doll and go get me some? 
 What? Get your own. 
 So, uh, what are gonna do about that menace Emma? 
 Oh, I've got big plans for her. 
 We're gonna do so mu... 
 Why are you walking like that? 
 You can't be this spastic and be a panther. 
 You're still a panther, right? 
 Of course. 
 Grr! 
 Go, panthers! 
 We're fun! 
 We're fierce! 
 We're farty! 
 What was that? 
 A joke. (Laughs) 
 I'm just messin' with you. 
 (Laughs) 
 You thought that was a real cheer? 
 I got you good. 
 No, I didn't believe you for a second. 
 I was just playing along. 
 Oh. Well, guess I can't fool you. 
 I mean, you are the original panther. 
 That's right. (Laughs) 
 To make up for it, let's go take posed pictures of us being cray-cray. 
 You mean like looking awesome but pretending to be caught off guard? 
 Yeah, that. 
 I love doing that! 
 Then we can send them in to miss information, and we don't know how she got them! 
 Great! Let's go! 
 Thud! 
 What was that? 
 Uh, probably just the hexoren turning over. 
 Emma says it likes to sleep on its side. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Is that lizard boy under my bed again? 
 Ugh, he's such a pain, blending into walls and hiding under things and scaring the pants off my mom. 
 That part's actually pretty fun. 
 (Laughs) Great. 
 I would love to see that, but right now it's picture time. 
 Come... 
 More than ever, I need to disappear, so pick me up and get me out of here.

 Emma? 
 I can explain! 
 You can explain what? 
 What? Oh. Oh! 
 I can explain why you found nothing under the bed. 
 You have... witchanoia! 
 Witchanoia? 
 Yes. Emma has it too. 
 Always thinking she sees and hears things that aren't there. 
 One time, she thought my dog was telling her government secrets. 
 (Gasps) 
 Let's bring this downstairs and look for a cure. 
 Not so fast! 
 The book stays. 
 (Sighs) Okay, I can... I can get this one. 
 (Laughs) 
 Prime numbers. Don't tell me. 
 It's a hard one. 
 When I was in high school, it stumped everyone at the mathlete marathon. 
 31 and 71! 
 (Laughs) You got it! 
 Yes! 
 Wow! 
 Wait, now I got a real doozy for you. 
 Check this. 
 Emma, you're back. 
 With Daniel. 
 Emma, are you okay? 
 Why are you wet? 
 Oh. I just fell into the pool. 
 You fell into the pool? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're not wet. You just watched her fall in? 
 Oh, nice. 
 No, I was already in. 
 Then had a change of clothes, and... and my hair... 
 It wasn't Daniel's fault. 
 (Laughs) It never is. 
 Are you all right? 
 I've got my cape in here. 
 Super absorbent. 
 I'm okay, thanks. 
 Beau, you're home! 
 What did you do with the boys? 
 I mean, qu'avez-vous fait avec les garcons? 
 What does that mean? 
 He swam with the sharks and then played the great jalapeño race, obvs. 
 (Whispering) Maddie. 
 You have to change him back. 
 But Sophie really likes him. 
 Look how happy she is. 
 Look what the cat dragged in. 
 Hi. 
 Are you... you? 
 Who else would I be? 
 Ugh, I can't wait until I tell Maddie you came by. 
 I got to go get dressed; It's pastel Friday. 
 I was kidding! 
 You should have seen your face. 
 It's you! 
 Relax, relax. I was only gone for a day. 
 It felt like a month. 
 Glad you're back. 
 Thanks for de-pantherizing me. 
 You should get dressed; We're gonna be late for school. 
 Wait. Not... not so fast. 
 Um, I'm still supposed to be mad at you. 
 For what? 
 For... 
 Wait, it'll come to me. 
 Right, for not taking all this magic stuff more seriously. 
 Why? 
 Well, 'cause you're my best friend, and I don't want to see you lose your powers or possibly disintegrate. 
 Aw. 
 That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. 
 And that's why I hardly ever do it. 
 Right. Right. Sorry. 
 Wait, did you say disintegrate? 
 I'm here! I'm here! 
 Where have you been? 
 We've been waiting here for five whole minutes! 
 You said we were meeting at 9:45. 
 No, I said 8:45! 
 Sorry, I sometimes have trouble hearing frequencies above 40,000 hertz. 
 I can help you with that. 
 Oh, I don't like the sound of this. 
 You not listening makes my anger trigger. 
 So to teach you a lesson, I'm going to make your ears bigger! 
 (Shrieks) 
 Beau, you saved me. 
 My hero! 
 Come on, Andi. 
 I'm sure you look fine. 
 I can't believe I let you talk me into this. 
 Hey, you were the one that said I had to take this magic thing more seriously, right? 
 That's not what I meant! 
 We have to use every advantage we have. 
 Since Maddie still thinks you're a panther... 
 Not a single word. 
 No. 
 Panthers! 
 I'm here. 
 Wassup? 
 You look... 
 Awesome. 
 You look awesome. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 So good. 
 I can't believe this is your first pastel Friday. 
 I'm a fast learner. 
 Now it's time for part two of the pastel Friday tradition. 
 Oh, what's that? 
 W... wait. 
 Wait, that... That's Emma's locker. 
 How do you know her combination? 
 (Laughs) 
 Oh, Andi. 
 Sometimes you ask the silliest questions. 
 (Laughs) 
 Now dump this all over everything. 
 What? 
 So Andi's Andi but is pretending to be a panther? 
 Yup. 
 And... She's gonna steal the book back? 
 I hope so. 
 Otherwise, I'll be powerless and Maddie will be... 
 Maddie to the 100th degree. 
 Can't you just take a bus somewhere and not be here for the eclipse? 
 We can hide in my grandmother's cabin in Tallahassee. 
 There's a great patio for stargazing. 
 I don't think I can. 
 Lily said something about me having to claim my powers or own them or something like that. 
 Oh! 
 I better put this in my agenda. 
 "Find out how Emma claims powers/ask grammy-gram about cabin availability." 
 I'll ask Lily the next time I see her. 
 Don't worry. 
 I won't let anything happen to you. 
 Go ahead. 
 But Emma's favorite collage is in there. 
 Who cares? 
 You're a panther, so you have to do a smoothie smother. 
 What did I miss? 
 Andi here is about to do her first smoothie smother in Emma's locker. 
 I can't. I can't. 
 I knew it. You're a panther imposter! 
 Go ahead. Turn me into a real panther. 
 Turn her into a crocodile. 
 No, send her somewhere terrible, like... 
 Bermuda. 
 (Shudders) 
 Four eggs in a basket, one in the pantry. 
 Let's have a celebration to turn... 
 Hey, girls. Is everything all right here? 
 Yes, nurse Lily. 
 Everything's great. 
 Nurse Lily! 
 I'm so glad you're here. 
 I actually have some important questions about... 
 Bunions. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Gonna eat that? 
 Freestyle. 
 You mean you're... 
 You're not gonna eat that burger freestyle or you're not listening to me freestyle? 
 Yes. 
 Sweet! 
 (Laughs) 
 Like I said, you should just ask another chick out to make her jealous. 
 
 
 
 Hi, Maddie. 
 Hi, Daniel. 
 Getting some more tater tots? 
 I know they're your favorite form of potato. 
 Actually, potato skins are. 
 You just think they're tater tots 'cause those are your favorites, and, uh... 
 I'll have the tater tots, thanks. 
 I know they're your favorite form of potato because we share a lot of favorite things. 
 I mean, sometimes we didn't, and I had to set you straight... 
 You want to go to beach ball with me? 
 And then he told me how much he missed me, and then he shared his tater tots with me, and then... 
 He asked you to beach ball. 
 And you said yes. 
 Both : And he was so happy. 
 (Gasps) 
 We should wear matching swimsuits like old times. 
 I need to text him. 
 So you're the only one without a date. 
 I wouldn't call a reptile a date. 
 He is a reptile. 
 Am I the luckiest girl in the world or what? 
 Speaking of beau, I haven't seen him all day. 
 Where is that slithery little lizardy boy? 
 (Computer chiming) 
 If it isn't the panther poser. 
 What do you want? 
 I want the hexoren, and you're going to bring it to me. 
 (Laughs) Am I? 
 And why would I do that? 
 Because I have something of yours you might want back. 
 (Gasps) 
 Beau! 
 You have ten minutes to make up your mind, or Emma turns him back into a lizard and sets him free into the wild. 
 Beau! 
 Maddie, we have to save him, or I'll... I'll... 
 So Lily's okay with me knowing about all this witch stuff? 
 I haven't told her yet, but I will. 
 I just hope she's not too upset with me. 
 It's not her I'm worried about. 
 Have you told Andi yet? 
 Yes! Don't worry about her. 
 She promised to be cool about it. 
 Tony! 
 (Yelps) 
 What is he doing here? 
 I'm... I'm helping Emma get the hex back. 
 Ha! The hex. 
 We don't need your help. 
 I've got it all covered. 
 Emma, can I see you in your room in a sec? 
 Oh, and bring the jar of crickets with you. 
 Did she just say jar of... 
 (Gags) 
 Andi? 
 What are you doing? 
 What is he doing here? 
 Oh, just, uh, killing zombie overlords in an amusement park. 
 Here. Keep playing. 
 And watch out for the zombies falling from the Ferris wheel. 
 Oh, trust me. They're coming. 
 Take these before I... 
 (Gags) 
 Is that Maddie's French cousin? 
 Uh, yes and no. 
 It depends what you mean by "French" and "cousin"... 
 Don't even try it. 
 Try what? 
 That thing you do where you repeat and question everything I say to try and confuse me. 
 Fine. Here's the short version. 
 Beau's not a real boy. 
 Like Pinocchio? 
 Sort of, except instead of being a puppet, he used to be a lizard. 
 Then Maddie turned him into a boy. 
 So he's not her cousin from France? 
 Actually, she is cold-blooded and slithery. 
 They might actually be related. 
 But I don't think he's French. 
 I mean, he has more of, like, a mediterranean... 
 Andi! Why is he here? 
 Is he the "him" Maddie's talking about in this text? 
 Oh, nice. 
 She's getting antsy. 
 For the last time, why is he here? 
 Isn't it obvious? 
 I kidnapped him, and now we're gonna trade him in for the hex. 
 (Wheezing) 
 Don't get overexcited, or else you'll faint again. 
 Breathe. 
 What are we going to do? 
 (Gasps) Ooh! 
 Are we going to steal beau back? 
 Double-cross them? 
 (Gasps) Smoothie smother them! 
 You can't give them the hexoren. 
 We're less then two weeks away from the eclipse! 
 I don't have a choice. 
 Look at her. She's a mess. 
 She'll ruin beach ball. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm sure they won't hurt beau. 
 But I'm touched you'd do this for me, Maddie. 
 See? I don't have a choice. 
 (Sighs) 
 I'm just saying, it's not a bad plan. 
 Trading a book for a person? 
 That's wrong. 
 I think it's more than that. 
 Like, an ethical dilemma. 
 It really depends on which philosophical theory you subscribe to... 
 The one where you don't trade a person for a thing. 
 But he's not a person. 
 He's a lizard masquerading as a person. 
 He's playing the great jalapeño race. 
 He likes it better than zombie overlords. (Scoffs) Can you believe that? Who wouldn't? The great jalapeño race is a classic. Andi, are you sure he's a lizard? I heard Maddie talking about it with Katie. Her mom wants her to turn him back into a... you know. Then why doesn't she? Because Sophie really likes him, and that's why my plan will work. Maddie will definitely trade the hex for beau. Why would she do something like that for someone else? She's a selfish, spoiled brat. Don't hold back, tone. (Laughs) Tell us how you really feel. And trust me; She'll do it for Sophie. (Phone beeps) This rarely happens, but I agree with Andi. It's our best shot. Yes! There it is. Maddie's bringing the hex to the seven. Let's go. Once we make this trade, we'll be one step closer to being able to relax and watch the eclipse on my new telescope instead having to hide and worry about somebody sucking the magic out of you. Uh... well put. (Sighs) This is our shot. What do you say? You're going to regret this. I'm going to turn you into a pair of very ugly high heels and wear you. Why would you wear ugly shoes? I wouldn't. My point is, is that if you were shoes, you'd be very ugly ones. Ah. Thank you for clearing that up. Now, where's the book? In my bag. Where's beau? In a safe place. First show me the book. Now you. And you better have him. Hi, Mrs. van pelt. I found beau wandering outside, so I thought I'd bring him back. Beau! You're okay! I was so afraid I'd never see you again, but I was pretty sure Emma wouldn't hurt you. Pretty! Lizards. Oh, it's your family. You miss them. You want to go home. Moi aussi. Here. You can talk to him. What? Put beau on the phone. Hi, Maddie. It's me, beau. Ooh, LA LA. I'm being held prisoner. I just want to go home. (Crying) Tony? What... What are you doing? I was... Whoa, that's, uh... Quite the hand strength you got there. Do you work out much? That wasn't him. Beau can't speak. Yes, he can. We taught him how. (Laughs) That's how smart and awesome we are. You better not have turned him back into a lizard, Andi. Sophie will be devastated, which means I'll be livid, which means you'll be... A pair of very ugly high heels. I know. He's in a safe place. I promise. Just-just give me the hexoren, and I'll take you to him. I can't believe you did that, and now my best friend is crying about that reptile. I should turn you into some tissues so she can blow her nose on you. Let's face it; You lost this one. I guess the panthers aren't as all-powerful as you thought. You deserve to be snotted on, so where's what I'll do. I'll turn you into a stack of tiss... Wait, wait, wait! Daniel's coming. Nice try. You're such a bad liar. Take some lying lessons, for crying out loud. Hey, guys. What are you two doing together? You don't have to do this. We can wait till Maddie gets here. It's okay. He wants to go home. (Sighs) Mrs. van pelt! Don't worry. She won't be able to undo Maddie's spell. Ready? Three blind mice in a... Stop! What do you think you're doing? It's okay. He wants to go home. Then I should be the one to do it. You can't trust her. We don't want you here. You're in the way. So I'm sending you far, far away.
