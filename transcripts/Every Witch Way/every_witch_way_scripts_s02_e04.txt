 [Kisses hand] 
 Ursula : Ahhh... 
 Girls, Ursula and I have something to tell you. 
 Something amazing! 
 Ooh, you're moving back to new transylvania? 
 Or wherever it is you're from. 
 No. [Laughs] 
 We... 
 We're in love! 
 Emma & Maddie: No, you're not! 
 We are? We are! 
 And we wanna get married as soon as possible. 
 Wahooooo! [Laughing] 
 Oh, isn't this wonderful, girls. 
 You're gonna be sisters, eh? 
 No-o-o-o-o-o! 
 No, dad! Really, no! 
 Why is Maddie crying? 
 She's crying tears of joy. 
 Tears of joy! 
 What is going on? 
 I don't know! 
 Why are you asking me? 
 Because this is obviously your fault! 
 Obvious how? 
 Obvious in the fact that it clearly isn't my fault! 
 Your mom's the one who's been after my dad for the past year! 
 Yeah, but your dad's the one who's dumb enough to fall for my mom! 
 I have to give you that one. But... 
 But this makes no sense. 
 Yesterday, he was mowing the lawn at night so your mom wouldn't "accidentally" run into him. 
 It's like somebody cast a spell on him or something. 
 [Gasps] Wait! 
 Did you get your powers back and not tell me? 
 No... but Andi said you did. 
 Sort of. It's complicated. [Laughs] 
 But I didn't do this. Okay, I believe you. 
 We just need to figure out how this happened so we can stop it. 
 Neither of us want to be sisters. 
 We need to work together. Agreed? 
 Agreed!

 Proxy! Here! 
 Freeze it for me. 
 [Snaps fingers] Locker! 
 [Snaps fingers] Books! 
 [Snaps fingers] Lip gloss! 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, here... one frozen smoothie. 
 Be faster next time. 
 Same for you. What's taking so long? 
 I'm not sure what class you have next. 
 Really? 
 She has history. 
 Oh, no, I didn't do Maddie's history essay. 
 That's due today. You didn't what? 
 Proxy, rain on Sophie! No need for that. 
 I wrote two history essays. 
 One on the roles that women played in the progressive era reforms from the 1800s through the 1920s. 
 And then, for fun, I compared and contrasted the foreign policies of Teddy Roosevelt and woodrow Wilson. 
 Ooh, don't keep me in suspense. 
 Whose policies were better? 
 They have more in common than you would think. 
 Just give it to me. Stop! 
 Proxy, rain on Katie. 
 Wait! Think of the essays. 
 You're right. Proxy, stop. 
 So, which one do you want? 
 I don't care. 
 I guess... 
 The one about the Teddy bears. 
 Teddy Roosevelt, it is. 
 Let me get this straight. 
 Your father and Mrs. van pelt are getting married? 
 It was so weird. 
 One minute, he's like, I'm gonna have to get another restraining order on Mrs. van pelt. 
 And the next, he's all '80s love songs and "would you like more ice cream, ursy wursy?" 
 I mean, I don't know her very well. 
 Maybe she's nice? 
 I mean... she can be, in that crazy, don't give her any more caffeine kind of way. 
 I need to sneak right on by. 
 Make me a spider so I can be a good spy. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 ♪ 
 I just thought he disliked Mrs. van pelt more than he dislikes me. 
 Emma : He doesn't. 
 You're wa-a-a-ay at the top of his dislike list. 
 I tried to win him over. 
 It's just most of my plans backfired. 
 Yep and backfired chocolate pudding all over his favorite shirt. The t3 did that. 
 I just took the rap. 
 Well, lucky for you, he's barely mentioned that ever since he's fallen in love with his... ursy wursy. 
 Maybe they got to talking and started liking each other. 
 No, that's just it. 
 It was like something suddenly changed. 
 Almost like a spell or something. 
 Oh, that can't be. 
 Why not? 
 Because you lost your powers and so did Maddie. 
 So, there's no one else left to cast a spell. 
 Yeah, uh, right! 
 Listen, Daniel... 
 I mean, I can come over after school and help you look for clues. 
 Emma : Giant spider! 
 Students : [Scream] 
 Run, everybody, run! 
 Where? 
 There, by the door! 
 Both : [Stomping feet] 
 Got it! 
 He got it! Sebastian got it! 
 We can relax now. 
 Oh, no, I'm injured. 
 ♪ 
 [Laughs] 
 Hmmmm... 
 Ooh, what's this? 
 Andi, why are you here? 
 And why are you dressed like the nurse? 
 Be... cause I am the nurse. 
 What? No, you're not. 
 I know for a fact that nurse Lily moved away and principal Alonso hasn't found a replacement yet. 
 Which is why he hired me. 
 Since my dad's a... [clears throat] 
 Doctor, I'm qualified to be the interim nurse. 
 So the principal hired his daughter's best friend. 
 That is an abuse of power! 
 You can read about it on "miss information." 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 The shark tryouts are at 3:00. 
 Kickboards, flipboards and arm floaties aren't allowed. 
 I'd assume that's a given, right? 
 You'd be surprised. 
 [Bugle music] 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 That's weird. 
 Tell me about it. 
 That's my girlfriend's dad. 
 Are you ready? There's two empty seats over there. 
 [Powers zapping] [Drink explodes] 
 Ursula : [Screams] Daniel! 
 Daniel, look what you've done! 
 Not just to me, but to my beloved, ursy wursy. 
 Uh... I... uh... I... 
 Oh, it's all right, franciscy wiscy. 
 You don't have to worry about little old me. 
 Do you have anything to say for yourself? 
 At least it was chocolate milk this time and not pudding. 
 [Laughs] Detention! Today! After school! 
 But I'm supposed to help Emma with her... 
 Homework. Yeah, right. 
 I've seen your grades, okay? She doesn't need your help. 
 You know what? No, come with me. 
 Come with me. Come on. Come on. 
 Honey, come on. I'm so sorry. 
 ♪ 
 I think it's kinda cool that Mr. Alonso and your mom... 
 Can you freeze your mouth shut, pronto! 
 I'm just saying that Mr. Alonso's a very cool... 
 I get it! 
 You like Mr. Alonso, video games and cooking. 
 Your favorite food is spaghetti. 
 You miss mack and your fastest time in the 100 meter individual medley is two minutes and ten seconds. 
 Your favorite condiment is... [laughing] 
 You were listening. ...Is cayenne pepper. 
 Who has a favorite condiment? You're so weird. 
 Everybody. 
 I want that girl's compact. 
 Get it for me, proxy. What's a compact? 
 That little round shiny thing right there. 
 But it's not yours. It's Ashley's. 
 Ashley and I share things all the time. 
 She won't mind. Now get it! 
 [Sighs] 
 Great! [Laughs] 
 Hmm... 
 Spell-o-vision? 
 Cool! I always wanted these. [Laughs] 
 Take five, proxy. 
 This better be good. 
 My dad wants to buy your mom an engagement ring. 
 Is that good enough? Don't panic. 
 We can't afford anything my mom would like. 
 Good point. 
 Hey, don't start picking on my dad! 
 It's your mom who's after him. You wish! 
 How do I know you didn't cast a spell on him? 
 Because I can't. I don't have my powers ba... 
 But Andi saw you cast a spell on a pen. 
 Oh, that, yeah. That was proxy. 
 What's proxy? 
 Not what, who. 
 You know, that guy with the strange weather powers. 
 Diego? 
 Yeah, that guy. 
 I want magical things to happen, he does them for me. 
 And Diego's okay with you using him? 
 [Laughs] He's delighted. 
 Are you done with my private life? 
 Yes. What do you think we should do? 
 I think we should make their lives miserable until they decided to stop this nonsense. 
 [Laughs] 
 What are you doing? 
 My locker got moved, so I'm taking yours. 
 No, you're not. 
 Yes, I am. 
 As the future principal's stepdaughter, I can take any locker I want. No, you can't! 
 As the actual daughter of the principal, I say you can't. 
 See, everybody, this is favoritism. 
 Plain and simple. No, it's not. 
 What's going on here? 
 Emma started it. 
 Maddie wants to steal my locker. 
 Oh, they're already fighting like sisters. 
 She thinks because she's the principal's future stepdaughter, she can do whatever she wants. 
 Please, I already do whatever I want. 
 It's Emma who's acting all crazy now. 
 Look, if you both want the same locker, why don't you just share it? 
 Sharing? 
 You're taking her side? 
 I'm taking the side of no fights. 
 I see what's going on here. 
 You do? 
 Mm-hm, now that you two are gonna be sisters, you wanna be next to each other. 
 Isn't that sweet? Oh... that is great. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 I'll find two empty lockers next to each other and I'll assign it to both of you. 
 Oh, that's perfect! 
 Ha! 
 Perfect! 
 
 
 
 That didn't go as planned. 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, I'm all for working together on this. 
 But I don't wanna be locker neighbors. 
 I made it! I made it, yeah! 
 This is detention, Mr. Miller, not a party. 
 But I'm glad you're happy to be here. 
 Hey, gigi, why are you here? 
 For breaking important news. 
 This school has no freedom of speech. 
 I didn't have a picture of Mr. Alonso and Mrs. van pelt in my "francisula" principal Parent romance article. 
 Should I publish this? [Laughs] What? 
 What's so funny, Mr. Miller? 
 Uh... 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Hey, Daniel. Jax? 
 Hey, Emma. 
 Heard you were having some trouble with your dad and Maddie's mom. 
 I'd be happy to help. 
 Who told you that? 
 [Laughs] No one. I'm a wizard. 
 A wizard not a psychic. 
 Yeah, well, in my case, same thing. 
 Watch. 
 I predict that you'll trip on your way to the kitchen. 
 Nice try. I'm not going into the kitchen. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 [Soap bubbles gurgling] 
 Hey! 
 [Powers zapping] 
 Gotcha. 
 Thanks. 
 Wait, you're the one that made me trip in the first place. 
 I take that thanks back. 
 But I still predicted the future, didn't I? 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, come on. 
 I just wanna help. 
 It's okay. 
 I'm actually waiting for someone else. 
 Who? Daniel? 
 It'll be a while before he gets back from detention. 
 I promised I'd wait for him. 
 And by that time, your dad'll probably be home. 
 Word on the street is that your dad doesn't like Daniel at all. Well... 
 Well, it's settled then. 
 Put me to work. 
 What can I do for you? 
 I don't understand what you're doing. 
 Your house must be really dirty, if you've never seen anyone do this. 
 I mean, just cast a spell. 
 I don't want to. 
 Why not? 
 So I can appreciate the work. 
 Have a sense of accomplishment. 
 I did this. 
 You get a sense of accomplishment from mopping? 
 Yes. Maybe you would, too, if you ever tried. 
 Doubt it. 
 I'm gonna go change. 
 Why don't you just... 
 I'm going to go change. 
 [Laughs] Okay. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 [Powers zapping] 
 What? Did I do that? 
 No. What are you drawing? 
 [Laughing] 
 Is it supposed to be me? 
 No, uh... 
 Then why does it say "Mr. Alonso" on the bottom? 
 I don't know. I swear. 
 Um, maybe you meant Mr. Alonso the mailman in our neighborhood. 
 Right, Daniel? 
 Our mailman's name is Mr. Alonso? 
 You're a lost cause. 
 [Laughing] 
 You think this is funny, hm? 
 Let's see how a week in detention suits you. 
 Gigi. Phone. Down! 
 [Laughing] 
 Best movie yet. 
 Come on, Mr. Miller, to the board. 
 I want you to write 100 times "I will not make fun of Mr. Alonso." 
 New plot twist. 
 "I will play tricks on Mr. Alonso all year." 
 [Laughing] It can't be happening again. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 All changed. 
 Great. 
 Ready to help. 
 That's okay. I'll wait for Daniel. 
 [Sighs] Daniel's not one of us, Emma. 
 You can't be asking him for help. 
 You can trust him. I trust him completely. 
 Then why didn't you tell him about having your powers back? 
 It's... it's complicated. 
 Well, explain it to me. 
 Oh, come on. 
 How many other teenaged witches or wizards do you know that you can talk to about this? 
 ♪ 
 So, Maddie lost her powers, but you got yours back? 
 Pretty much. Want some pie? 
 Mrs. van pelt brought it over for my dad. 
 Homemade straight from the store. 
 Um, I'm good, thanks. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 ♪ Hello - ♪ 
♪ hello - ♪ 
 Hello terribles? What are you doing here? 
 Daniel couldn't make it, so he sent us to help. 
 They know, too? 
 No. 
 They're just really good at finding things. 
 Know what? 
 [Laughs] 
 Isn't that cute. 
 Daniel sent his little siblings to replace him. 
 Who are you? 
 What are you doing here? 
 And who are you calling little and cute? 
 Jax was just leaving. 
 I was? 
 So, how are you going to help? 
 We're going to lift prints inside your house and see if anybody's been there that shouldn't have been. 
 You have that kind of technology? 
 Yeah. Duh! 
 But, first, we need some baby powder. 
 Come on, I think I have some in my room. 
 Oooh, pie. 
 Wait. 
 Make sure it isn't booby-trapped. 
 It's clean. 
 Oh, hey, t3, what are you doing? 
 [Mouth full of food] We're having some pi... 
 Why are you looking at me like that? 
 So, yeah, "operation break up" is not going well. 
 I don't know what is wrong with my dad. 
 He also gave me a detention for the rest of the month... 
 Except for today. 
 We have tryouts to find a new shark. 
 He must be really mad at me. He is. 
 But, lucky for you, Mrs. Van pelt is distracting him. 
 Though I'd rather he obsess over your punishment than marry Mrs. van pelt. 
 Come on, if you were me, wouldn't you feel the same way? 
 Okay, I might. 
 Oh, thanks for sending the t3 over to help yesterday. 
 Did they, um, find anything? 
 Not really. 
 Tommy and rob just stuffed themselves with pie and Mel covered the house in baby powder. 
 [Laughs] That sounds about right. 
 Um... when they were at your house, did Andi give them some cool new tools or something? 
 I don't think so. Why? 
 Tommy and rob came home and they could not stop talking about Andi and how she's the coolest girl in the world. 
 Oh, that's sweet. 
 I need you to get me Sebastian's homework from his backpack. 
 Sophie forgot mine... again. 
 No. 
 What's that? 
 I'm not stealing his homework. 
 You should have done yours. Proxy, how dare you! 
 My name isn't proxy, it's Diego. 
 And I'm totally over this. 
 I'm not stealing stuff for you any more. 
 It's not stealing, it's borrowing! 
 Okay, we have some good times here. 
 But, as a reminder, no cannonballs. 
 All right, only Jax left and I guess he'll race... you. 
 Okay, let's do this. 
 I have to warn you... 
 Daniel broke the national freestyle record last year. 
 And the doggie paddle record. 
 All : [Laughing] 
 Well, uh, I hope it's enough to push me to my best and I hope I get on the team. 
 Okay. 
 [Powers zapping] 
 ♪ 
 [Whistle shrills] 
 ♪ 
 Wow, Jax is slaughtering Daniel. 
 I know. We're totally gonna win nationals! 
 Hey, what are those? 
 Oh, these? 
 They're just my, uh, new sunglasses. 
 Custom-made. 
 Wait! 
 No way. He's a witch?
