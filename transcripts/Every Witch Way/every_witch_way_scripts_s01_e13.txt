 Would you look who it is? 
 Leave me alone. 
 You are alone, which is strange. 
 Yeah, where's your little friend? 
 Oh, wait. That's right. 
 I saw you two this morning, and you weren't talking. 
 You guys get in a fight or something? 
 Oh, she got in a fight, and now she has no friends. 
 Boo hoo. 
 Leave me alone, or I'll lose one of my drill bits in your ear. 
 I know what you need. 
 You need new friends, friends like us. 
 I'd rather be fed to zombies. 
 But you love zombies, so you would love us. 
 Just like Sophie, Katie, and me, a panther you shall be. 
 Why am I wearing this outfit? 
 (Gasps) And these shoes? 
 Get me out of these, stat. 
 Oh, no! 
 No. I'm... I'm hideous. 
 Did it work? 
 Seems like it. 
 Who dressed me this morning? 
 A 12-year-old boy? 
 Anybody have any spare outfits I can borrow? 
 I have tons of clothes in my locker. 
 Eight extra outfits, one for every day of the week. 
 Great. Let's go. 
 Come on, Maddie. Move it, stat. 
 "Stat" is my thing. 
 Who's this, your new boyfriend? 
 I wish. No, he's... 
 He's my cousin from France, yeah. 
 Speaks no English. 
 Now let's go get you decent. 
 And discuss how to destroy Emma. 
 Oh, we're gonna be great friends.

 So what do you say? It'll be fun. 
 What is it? 
 It's the annual beach volleyball tournament. 
 Everyone goes. 
 And I'm in charge of music, so you know it'll be rocking. 
 So you're not playing? 
 Oh, no, I never do. 
 Although this year, I just might unleash some of my mad v-ball skillz on the sand. 
 Sure. Sounds fun. 
 Hello, Diego. 
 Eaten any canned eyes lately? 
 Did you say kanay? 
 Yes, canned eye. 
 Canned-eye peas. 
 Close relative of black-eyed peas. 
 They're today's special. 
 Oh, okay, great. 
 Well, in that case, I love peas... 
 Black-eyed peas, plain old peas, peas in my pasta, peas in my potpie. 
 Enough pea talk. 
 Get back to class. You're gonna be late. 
 Ah! 
 Hey, you left your... 
 Tray on the table. 
 Ugh! 
 Children. 
 When I get the chosen one's powers, my first order of business is gonna be to eliminate them, all of them. 
 (Sniffs) 
 Nurse Lily. 
 How can I help you? 
 Just getting a bottle of water. 
 Allow me. 
 (Sniffs) 
 Smells funny in here, doesn't it? 
 Well, we do have a lot of 13-year-old boys with some serious hygiene issues. 
 They think soap, shampoo, and showers are optional. 
 They're all useless nuisances getting in our way. 
 Wow. 
 That's surprising, coming from a principal. 
 Sorry. 
 I, um... 
 (Gasps) Miss pitch? 
 Oh, no. 
 Are all those frogs in there people? 
 (Croaks) 
 Well, I better get hopping. 
 I mean going. 
 Looking this good takes time. 
 You look... 
 Amazing! 
 Of course I do. 
 Lip gloss. 
 Here. 
 Smoothie. 
 Sophie's on her way. 
 I'll call her and... 
 I'm here! I'm here! 
 Where's mine? 
 Oh, I only had time to get one. 
 What? 
 Chill out, Maddie. 
 I mean, you're a witch, aren't you? 
 Just make one appear. 
 Now, listen up, girls. 
 As panthers, we rule the school. 
 Everyone should love us and be scared of us at all times. 
 She's right. 
 I love panther Andi. 
 Mac, I've been looking for you. 
 For me? Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I need you to help me with my new friend, beau. 
 He's a Liz... I mean... 
 "" Sophie, make sure you say he is my cousin from France. 
 Don't mess up. Maddie." 
 So he's "Maddie's cousin from France"? 
 "Yes." 
 And I thought about who's the most "like him," and you were the "obvious choice." 
 Of course. I'll hang out with him. 
 Great! 
 Beau, this is... 
 Where'd he go? 
 I could have sworn he was right behind you a second ago. 
 Beau, you are going to hang out with Mac and do normal boy stuff. 
 (Sniffs) 
 (Rock music) 
 ♪ 
 Andi? 
 Andi, what, uh... 
 What is it, Emma? 
 Black cat got your tongue? 
 What are you doing? 
 She's with us now. 
 That's right. 
 I'm a panther now and forever. 
 (Girls giggling) 
 Andi, what... Did Maddie do this? 
 This has to be a spell. It's not. 
 I can undo this. 
 Yeah, right. 
 You don't even have the Hexerin, and you've barely practiced. 
 But I... 
 When the eclipse comes, Maddie is gonna Jack all your powers. 
 That's why I need your help! 
 Let me spell it out for you. 
 You and me, not friends anymore. 
 That'll teach you not to mess with me. 
 When I defend my powers and become the chosen one for good, I'm going to confiscate your powers until you learn to play fair and not hurt other people. 
 That's it? 
 Ooh, I'm shaking in my designer wedges. 
 You're so mean! 
 And another great comeback from Emma. 
 (Laughs) 
 Ugh! 
 I have got to learn how to make my anger appear scarier. 
 It's all starting to make sense. 
 There are two young witches here. 
 One of them may be the chosen one. 
 And to protect her, the council sends a guardian, the nurse. 
 You're right. 
 Does the council know about you? 
 Oh, they think they destroyed me a long time ago, took my powers and left me to rot in the human world. 
 But you still have powers. 
 And they didn't get all of them. 
 They left me just enough power to steal more power. 
 Well, that's quite an oversight. 
 Just because these witches are on the council doesn't mean they're all that bright. 
 If she's a guardian, I'll find out. 
 Oh, don't you worry. 
 I'll take it from here. 
 Yikes. 
 Andi as a panther is a little scary. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Emma, I know you care about her, but you've got bigger problems. 
 I know, but I need Andi. 
 She's my best friend, and I'm not leaving her behind. 
 That's a little dramatic. 
 But it'll do. 
 So will you train me? 
 Only if you're all in. 
 We don't have a lot of time, and I'd rather not be around to see you go down in flames. 
 I'll defeat Maddie. 
 Maddie's not our biggest problem anymore. 
 There's another witch, the principal. 
 First order of business, new cheers, and then... 
 No. 
 Okay, first order of business, Saturday's beach ball. 
 Okay, does everybody have dates? 
 I do. 
 That are not reptiles. 
 (Sighs) 
 I see we all have our work cut out for us. 
 Let's make a list of guys and... 
 How about instead we make a list of Emma's weaknesses and then devise a plan to steal her powers during the eclipse? 
 Daniel says you're great at making plans. 
 It's one of your many great qualities. 
 I am. It's true. 
 And you know Emma best, so you're my... I mean, our best weapon. 
 Oh! Get a pen and paper. 
 I dictate. You write. 
 Oh, what a cool-looking trunk. What do you keep in here? 
 Don't open it! Step away. Nobody opens my trunk. 
 Oh! "Don't touch my trunk. That's where I keep my Hexerin and all my magic stuff." 
 No, I don't! 
 Why are you so interested in the hex-a-gram anyway? 
 So you can cast some spells and we can have some fun. 
 I'm in. 
 Me too. 
 Now get the Hexerin, and let's get our cray-cray on. 
 I don't know what that means. 
 It means we're gonna conjure up some serious crazy here. 
 Yes! 
 Andi's right. 
 You never conjured any real cray-cray for us. 
 Fine. 
 Let's conjure up some serious cray. 
 Yay! 
 Let's try something easy. 
 Which one first, Andi? 
 (Sighs) 
 It's past its prime. It's sung its tune. 
 So turn this flower into a spoon. 
 Whoa. 
 As Andi would say, "that was way pitiful, dude." 
 It's kind of drab and faded from the sun. 
 Make this couch look a bit more fun. 
 Close enough! (Laughs) 
 
 
 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Hey, Tony. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, you looked a little upset at school, so I brought over my favorite sudoku books. 
 Oh. 
 That's thoughtful of you. 
 Uh, come on in. 
 Re-decorating? 
 You could say that. 
 So are you practicing magic? 
 Trying. 
 Well, that's how you become a great magician. 
 You practice, practice, practice, and when you think you can't practice anymore... 
 Keep practicing. 
 Actually, have a ham sandwich. 
 Then you keep practicing. 
 I'll keep that in mind. 
 So you need any help? 
 I don't know. 
 (Sighs) 
 Hi, coach. 
 Dude, you parked far away from everything. 
 So no one will see you here. 
 We have a lot to work on, so let's get started. 
 Yes, sir! 
 Hey, I'm serious. 
 I'm already risking enough doing this. 
 Are you ready? 
 Yeah, but I don't really understand the whole kanay thing. 
 Right now, the most important thing for you to know is to stay away from witches. 
 (Scoffs) Witches? 
 Well, that'll be easy, because they don't exist. 
 Okay, we have a lot more work to do than I thought. 
 Let's start simple, a fireball. 
 Can you really, really conce... 
 Whoa. 
 Like that? 
 So I just shimmy this way and turn that way. 
 And... 
 Ta-da! 
 Do you want some help? 
 Uh, no, no, I got this. 
 I'm stepping in. 
 He couldn't get out in a snap, so release Tony from his trap. 
 Emma! 
 That was great! 
 You cast a spell at the spur of the moment, and it worked perfectly! 
 You must work well under pressure. 
 You know what? I do! 
 Like when I turned monkey-Lily back into human-Lily at the last second. 
 You're right! 
 Aren't you glad you didn't erase my memory? 
 Yes, and you're doing a great job acting like you don't know. 
 So what's next? 
 I... 
 Magically untie these knots while under pressure from you chasing me around the house? 
 Mm...

 Maddie Winky, do you have... 
 Oh. 
 (Stammering) 
 Oh, hey, mom. (Laughs nervously) 
 What's up? 
 So what do we do now? Go after Andi? 
 I want to, but I don't know if she's still mad at me. 
 I don't want to make things worse between us. 
 How could it be worse than her being a panther? 
 You're right. 
 I have to save her and get the Hexerin back. 
 That's the book full of all the awesome magic tricks, isn't it? 
 Uh, something like that. 
 Maddie stole it from me. 
 Maddie's holding Andi and the Hexerin hostage? 
 Yes. 
 I've got to get both out of her house, and I have no clue how. 
 Just leave that to me. 
 Come on; I'm going to the pool, and you and lieutenant oddball aren't staying here by yourselves. 
 Why so grumpy? 
 Is it because Emma's going to beach ball with Tony? 
 No. 
 And how do you know? 
 Miss information. 
 Is there anyone who doesn't follow her? 
 You know what to do, right? 
 Ask Maddie to beach ball to make Emma jealous. 
 Why? I don't want to do that. 
 Trust me. It's fool-proof. 
 Hi, Mrs. van pelt. 
 Hi, Tommy. 
 It's Tony. Is Maddie home? 
 I'm here to work on our science project. 
 We don't have a science project due. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 (Banging noise) What was that? 
 Uh, just the supplies rattling around. 
 (Banging noise) 
 I'll be the judge of that. 
 Told you. 
 "Told you. 
 Now I'm gonna tell my mommy on you." 
 (Girls laughs) 
 Hey! 
 Oh, sorry. (Laughs) 
 Sometimes the wheels get a little bit wonky. 
 I still don't remember having a project due. 
 Maybe the biology teacher assigned it the day you skipped class... 
 Sophie, stitch it! 
 Well, the good thing about being paired up with Tony is that he's crazy smart. 
 Wow. Thanks, Andi. 
 And he'll do the entire project on his own and get you both "a" s. 
 Uh, no. Maddie? 
 You'll be doing the project with Timmy here. 
 Tony. 
 And you'll get "a" s based on the work you do together. 
 Hmm! 
 ♪ Yeah ♪ 
 You'll want this back later. 
 Each pair had to pick at least two ecosystems. 
 I picked rainforest, coral reef, arctic tundra, redwood forest, and underwater cave. 
 What? You were only supposed to pick two! 
 No, at least two. (Laughs) 
 Are there any even left? 
 Oh, sure there is: Alpine tundra, aquatic estuaries, snow desert, underwater snow desert, underwater desert, you know, which some people don't think they exist, but they actually exist. 
 They exist. Trust me. 
 And then there's urban. 
 There's skies. 
 There's underwater caves. 
 All those too? 
 No. 
 There's... I'm just explaining how... what we could have picked, but I picked the easy ones for you. 
 Like, underwater cave? It's like, boom, you're done. 
 There you are! 
 I knew it! 
 Something didn't smell right about all of this, and it's you. 
 Andi. 
 I don't know what Maddie did, but this isn't you. 
 Yes, it is. 
 This is the real me. 
 Andi, the true Andi, I know she's in there. 
 Come on out! 
 What are you gonna do? Cast a spell? 
 You're so rusty, you probably can't even do them anymore. 
 She's not a panther, a fairy, or an elf. 
 Turn Andi into her old self. 
 Oh, no, you didn't! 
 Maddie! 
 Did you hear that? 
 Yes. It was my stomach growling. 
 It came from upstairs. 
 Uh, wait! 
 Andi? 
 Em? 
 Why am I wearing a costume? 
 Are you... you? 
 Why are we in Maddie's room? 
 Maddie turned you into a panther. 
 Ugh! 
 And you snuck in to save me? 
 Yeah, and to get this. 
 The hex! You found it! 
 Yup, but listen. 
 We need to get out of here. 
 Maddie's on her way up. 
 The window! 
 High heels? 
 They were torturing me? 
 (Footsteps) 
 She's coming! 
 This better be good, Andi. 
 You know how extra walking for no good reason frustrates me. 
 What are you doing up here? 
 Relaxing with my favorite magazine, teen vo-goo-ee. 
 So, uh, what are gonna do about that menace Emma? 
 Oh, I've got big plans for her. 
 We're gonna do so mu... 
 Why are you walking like that? 
 I think I got a corn on my toe. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go get a butter knife and cut it out. 
 Yes, let's. 
 And take this.
