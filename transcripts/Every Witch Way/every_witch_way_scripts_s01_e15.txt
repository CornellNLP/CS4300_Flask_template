 Three blind mice in a... 
 Stop! 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 It's okay. He wants to go home. 
 Then I should be the one to do it. 
 You can't trust her. 
 We don't want you here. You're in the way. 
 So I'm sending you far, far away. 
 (Zapping) 
 Give it up! 
 I'm more powerful than you. 
 You wish! 
 Don't let go, mad. You can take her. 
 Stay strong, Emma. You got this. 
 Why are you cheering for Emma? 
 It was two-on-one, so I thought I'd make it an even two-on-two to keep it exciting. 
 No? No. 
 While you've been out trying to steal my boyfriend, I've been practicing magic with the hacky-sackoren. 
 Seriously? You still can't say it right? 
 Girls, stop this now! 
 Her first! 
 No way! I don't trust her. 
 Uh, uh, uh... okay. 
 Both of you at the same time. 
 On "three," you're gonna drop your spell, okay? 
 Ready. 
 Three! 
 Mom, if you say "on three," you have to start at one. 
 Even I know that. 
 Right. Okay, sorry. 
 Um, one, two, let go! 
 I-I-I mean three. 
 I... (Grunts) 
 See? Now, was that so hard? 
 She was trying to hurt beau. 
 No, she wasn't. 
 She was changing him back into a lizard. 
 I wanted her to. 
 Ha! 
 She's not even powerful enough to do that. 
 Actually, I am. 
 It does seem like she's as powerful as you. 
 (Gasps) I mean almost. 
 No, she's not. 
 And plus I still have the halogenoren.

 (all screaming) 
 Katie, grab it! 
 Oh! 
 Ha! 
 (All screaming) 
 Katie, are you okay? 
 I'm okay. 
 The hexoren is getting away! Go! 
 (All screaming) 
 Shh. Don't scare it away. 
 I got this. 
 (Breathes deeply) 
 Ah! (All gasp) 
 That book really doesn't like you. 
 No, it just... Has an attitude problem. 
 I'll get it. 
 No, I can get it. 
 Okay, everybody step aside. 
 I've got this! 
 Hey, come back here! 
 Come... come back here! 
 Thud! 
 It's gone. 
 See what you did? Me? 
 You're the one that scared it away with your giant man hands. 
 My what? 
 She was making fun of the enormous size and masculinity of your han... 
 Shouldn't we be trying to hunt it down? 
 It'd be really bad if people saw it, like, flying around town. 
 Yes, let's go find my book. 
 I'm going. 
 The hex is probably flying back to its rightful home anyway. 
 The library? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 (Sighs) All right, let's do this. 
 Come on, beau. You're going back to France. 
 He's not really French, Maddie. 
 (Sighs) 
 So the hex just flew away, like, flapping its page wings? 
 No. 
 More like it floated up and zoomed off, like a spaceship. 
 Cool. 
 I mean, not cool. 
 Terrible. 
 Terrible? Try tragic. 
 We have no idea where it is. 
 But neither does Maddie or the principal. 
 That's a relief, sort of. 
 You girls ready for the beach ball, huh? 
 (Humming) 
 Uh, yeah, dad. 
 We're just waiting for Tony to get here, and then we're all heading over. 
 Actually, just you and Tony. 
 I have something I have to do first. 
 What? 
 Uh, just some last-minute beach ball training. 
 Mr. a? 
 You're out of trail mix, fyi. 
 Um, that's because you ate it all, fyi. 
 Mr. a. 
 Hmm? 
 As a representative of the student body, I feel a duty to tell you: Never do that in school. 
 Do what? The beach bump or the fyi? 
 Both. 
 What is she doing? 
 She's saying good-bye to beau. 
 That's kind of sweet. 
 Weird but sweet. 
 (Sniffs) Oh. 
 I am gonna miss that little lizard boy. 
 Mom, are you crying? 
 Well, I always wanted a son. 
 I'd cheer him on at his baseball games. 
 He'd be very protective of me when my legions of suitors stopped by. 
 Legions? 
 He'd be on my side when my ungrateful daughter talked back to me. 
 (Crying softly) Go ahead. 
 Your family's waiting. 
 I'll miss you, but I'll be okay. 
 I promise. 
 Here we are at beach ball 2013. 
 It's a grudge match between the dolphins and our sharks. 
 Look who's here. 
 Emma and Tony, say hello to the camera. 
 So is this your first date? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 It is? 
 So here we have iridium's newest item. 
 Want to see a beach-themed magic trick? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Hurry up, Daniel. 
 East sun is my best sun. 
 Look at what the tide dragged in, a squid and a sea urchin. 
 (Sighs) Maddie. 
 Wait, which one am I? 
 'Cause, personally, I'd rather be the squid, because they can change color like a chameleon. 
 This is so good. 
 My best work ever. 
 Oh, don't mind me. 
 Carry on. (Laughs) 
 Come on, gigi. That's enough. 
 Let go! 
 You're interfering with my reportage. 
 What is reportage? 
 It's French for "give me my camera!" 
 No! 
 Tag me in! Tag me in! 
 Hey, hey, stop it, both of you. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 You're fighting with your sister? 
 She started it. 
 She got all up in my friends grille. 
 I have a duty to my public. 
 Plus, he has my camera! 
 Ha! I do. 
 You're in high school! 
 Act like it! 
 Daniel, where are you setting me up? 
 What? 
 My things. 
 My station of relaxation on the beach? 
 You know the drill. 
 Come on, Emma. 
 I've reserved a great spot for us. 
 Well, you can't reserve a spot on the public beach. 
 Oh, really? 
 Well, nice to see you. 
 Good luck. 
 I'll find us a spot. 
 What you doing? Digging for bones? 
 (Laughs) 
 'Cause of the race where you did the doggy paddle? 
 Whatever. 
 You know, today's trophy is gonna look great in my room next to the one from last year. 
 Not gonna happen. 
 Come on, guys. Let's go warm up. 
 Come in, Andi. 
 Get ready for beach ball 2013! 
 (All cheering) 
 Good luck. 
 Thanks. 
 She was talking to me. 
 Oh. 
 I was talking to both of you. 
 Go, sharks! (Laughs) 
 (All cheering) 
 (Upbeat rock music) 
 ♪ 
 (whistle blows) 
 Crowd : Let's go, sharks! Let's go, sharks! 
 Let's go, sharks! Let's go, sharks! 
 Let's go, sharks! Let's... 
 (All cheering) 
 You do know today is beach ball, right? 
 I do. So what? 
 So this better be good. 
 It is. 
 I've been doing some research about the principal. 
 I don't know exactly who she is yet, but I'm getting closer. 
 That's it? You could have just texted me. 
 Not just that. 
 I wanted to talk to you about becoming Emma's guardian. 
 Yes! I mean, isn't that your job? 
 But yes! 
 It is, and technically you can't be a guardian unless you're a powerless witch, but Emma needs all the help she can get. 
 Help is my middle name. 
 So where's my kit? 
 You don't need one. 
 Uh, I don't know, Lily. 
 I think I'm definitely gonna need a kit, you know. 
 Okay, guys. It's match point. 
 Diego, set up the ball for Tony at the net. 
 Okay. 
 Why me? 
 Hmm, I don't know. 
 Maybe 'cause you jump, like, ten feet in the air. 
 All right, let's do this, guys. 
 Yeah, let's. (Giggles) 
 What are you doing? 
 Stealing my camera back. 
 Oh, and your sandals, phone, and tablet. 
 Later! Gigi! 
 Diego! It's match point! 
 Whoa, dude. Did you put on sunblock? 
 You're awfully red. 
 Um, Diego, calm down. 
 Think happy thoughts. Hap... happy thoughts. 
 (People cheering) 
 (Thunderous boom) 
 (Dramatic music) 
 ♪ 
 
 
 
 Did he just shatter the volleyball? 
 Yes... 
 Which means... 
 He has powers. 
 Ah! It's solid ice. 
 What's going on here? 
 Let's, um, not jump to conclusions, Sophie. 
 Oh, I never jump to conclusions. 
 I quietly sneak up on them. 
 Go check out what happened. 
 If he's a wizar... 
 A warlo... 
 Whatever it's called, we need to know asap. 
 Omg. 
 Iay. Brb. 
 What's goin' on? 
 There something fishy about this ball. 
 Let me see. 
 I must have filled it with the wrong tank. 
 I keep the air and liquid nitrogen tanks next to each other. 
 You have a liquid nitrogen tank at your school? 
 Yeah, don't you? No? 
 Guess our school's better in more ways than one. 
 Why don't we take a little water break while we figure this out, huh? 
 Diego. 
 What did I tell you about using your powers in public? 
 Um, I don't remember exactly. 
 I told you, don't use your powers in public. 
 But I didn't do it on purpose. 
 It just... I got so upset right before hitting the ball, and then boom, frozen ball city. 
 You need to be much more careful from now on. 
 If you feel upset or angry, you need to calm down before you do something that might be influenced by your emotions. 
 Well, that doesn't sound fun at all. 
 Being a kanay isn't just fun and magic powers. 
 There's responsibility involved. 
 Okay, I got it. 
 But, hey, you got to admit, that was pretty good how I covered your whole liquid nitrogen tank story, huh? 
 "No, don't you? 
 Guess our school's better in more ways than one." 
 You got to admit that was pretty good. 
 Hmm? Okay, fine. 
 It was good. 
 What now? 
 We find out whether Diego has magic powers. 
 If he does, I've got to get him on my side before Emma or the principal does. 
 The principal? 
 What does she mean? 
 Who'd have thought that volleyball could be so refreshing? 
 Hi, I'm Maddie, Maddie van pelt, head panther. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Seriously? "Nice to meet you"? 
 We've been classmates for, like, ten years already. 
 (Clears throat) I know who you are. 
 Now, tell me. 
 What kind of spell was that? 
 Can we get back to business? 
 Ooh, the magic tablet. 
 I love this! 
 If you're not gonna let me play with any of the toys, why am I here? 
 So you can help me research who the principal is. 
 I have a bad feeling about her. 
 Great. 
 So now not only do we have to worry about Maddie but the principal too? 
 If I'm right, the principal's been around a long time, and she would do anything to get rid of anyone who gets in her way. 
 Maddie pales in comparison. 
 Come on. 
 I mean, you can't get much worse than Maddie. 
 Put it to you this way. 
 Maddie turned me into a monkey. 
 If the principal is who I think she is, she would turn me into a monkey, send me to the wild, and have a pack of hungry hyenas waiting for me. 
 Awesome! 
 I... I mean, wow. 
 That's bad. 
 So what kind was it? 
 What are you talking about? I... I don't... 
 It's okay. I'm a you-know-what too. 
 No, I don't know what. 
 You know, with the whoosh and the whee and the ta-da? 
 Huh? "Ta-da"? 
 Yes! 
 (Sighs) 
 (Whispering) I have powers too. 
 You? 
 You're a kanay too? 
 Andi's skipping beach ball to do some... 
 Research? 
 About the volleyball? 
 Oh, no need. 
 That was just Diego and his freezing thing. 
 What do you mean, "freezing thing"? 
 Like the icicle on his nose, remember? 
 And before that, Daniel's notebook. 
 And I think I heard Mac say he froze him. 
 Wow. 
 Really? 
 And now Maddie's talking to him? 
 I don't want to sound paranoid, but I need to find out what they're talking about. 
 I'm on it. 
 Wait, I meant that... That I was going to cast a spell to hear them. 
 Sorry, after... After you. 
 No, go ahead. 
 You've been running around, playing volleyball. 
 I've just been watching you running around playing volleyball. 
 You've been watching me? 
 No. 
 I mean, yes, but I've been watching everyone play, not just you. 
 So are you going to the seven for the afterparty? 
 I think so. Tony's dj'ing. 
 You? Yeah. 
 I mean, after I carry the entire contents of Maddie's patio back to her house. 
 Are you and Maddie, uh, back together? 
 You know, because you came together, and you used to date, but whatever. 
 Hey, I came with Tony, so it's like I'm the pot calling the kettle, you know... 
 "Hi, pot." "Hi, kettle." 
 Wait, wait, am I the pot or the kettle? 
 I'm the pot. 
 No, you're the pot. 
 I'm the kettle. No, wait. 
 Okay, I got it. 
 Me, pot. You, kettle. 
 Okay. 
 Well, then the kettle is not back together with Maddie. 
 Is the pot dating the Tony? 
 I mean the... 
 Sorry, I don't know what Tony would be in this scenario. 
 He would be just... 
 A good friend. 
 Oh. 
 ♪ Oh, oh ♪ 
 (funky electronic music) 
 (Both laughing) 
 (Laughs) 
 I know. Hilarious, right? 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Um, right now? 
 Uh, it's about... The music selection for the afterparty. 
 Oh, okay, sure. 
 I'll see you later? 
 Yeah, definitely. 
 Yeah, definitely. We'll see you later. 
 (Chuckles) 
 ♪ Oh, oh so you think that you're a... 
 Oh, it's okay. 
 They know. 
 A witch? 
 (Laughs) That's ridiculous. 
 You don't believe in witches, but... 
 But you do believe you're the... 
 The last living member of an ancient tribe that controls fire, ice, and other natural elements? 
 Yeah, because I am. 
 If you're a witch, then prove it. 
 You first. 
 Hello, did you not just see me freeze and shatter that volleyball? 
 Show us so we know it wasn't a one-time fluke. 
 Okay, stand back. 
 Diego. 
 Uh, hey, coach. 
 I need you to help me pack up. 
 Now. 
 Yeah, sure. Okay. 
 Panthers, keep an eye on him. 
 Is it okay if I keep both eyes on him? 
 I'm not very good at winking. 
 Wait! 
 Why is... Where are you going? 
 Look. 
 Murgatroyd farquhar, 1975, in the mustard gigantor pants. 
 They're called bell bottoms. 
 And this one, felicity bumpermidge, 1988. 
 Is she wearing in football pads under her sweater? 
 No, that was just the fashion back then. 
 And all the rest of these. 
 They're all her, right? 
 Well, they certainly all look like her, but we don't have definite proof. 
 Oh. 
 I think we do. 
 Do you have a magnifying glass in here? 
 Nope, but we don't need one. 
 (Electronic beeping) 
 No way. 
 (Electronic beeping) 
 They're all the same person. 
 She has the same birthmark on her neck. 
 You're right. 
 Of course I am. 
 I have to tell the council. 
 Great. Let's get the magic tablet. 
 Hey, you know what this party could really use? 
 Some music! 
 I... I've almost got it. 
 I just need to find the input. 
 No, the output. 
 No, the a/c adapter. 
 Hey, maybe Daniel can play something while we wait. 
 Oh, I didn't bring my guitar. 
 We really need some music in here, so I'll make Daniel's guitar now appear. 
 Well, too bad. Maybe next time. 
 Just wait till you hear my jammin' mixes. 
 Here it is. 
 We brought it, remember? 
 I don't remember bringing my guitar, but, again, there was so much stuff. 
 Play something. 
 Maddie, I don't like playing in public. 
 I'm sure you'll be great. 
 Okay. 
 Am I dressed right to meet the witches' council? 
 Maybe I should replace my hat with this hat. 
 I think it has more of a sophisticated look to it. 
 The witches' council will love this hat, right? 
 Look, this is serious. 
 Stand back.
