 Ow! 
 What are you doing? 
 You wouldn't answer my calls, and your dad keeps closing the door on me, so I, uh... 
 You decided to go all stalker on me...? 
 Please, just hear me out. 
 I don't know what came over me this week. 
 It's like I was possessed or something. 
 Okay. 
 Go on. 
 But I wanted to tell you that... 
 I like you. 
 You do? 
 Yes. 
 You're quirky, you're a little bit cheesy, and you definitely talk a lot. 
 Gee, thanks. 
 No, no, I meant that as a compliment, but lately I can't say anything right. 
 Like yesterday I kept saying the opposite of what I meant. 
 Previously on every witch way... 
 We're upside down. 
 According to miss information, Daniel got back with Maddie. 
 Well, with Tony, there's only one thing to do now. 
 What's that? 
 You're just gonna have to wipe his memory. 
 Cool. 
 What? 
 Just bring me your kanay tomorrow. 
 You are not gonna hurt him, are you? 
 Of course not. 
 Duh, there's no such thing as witches. 
 Actually, yes, there are, and I'm one of them.

 Ow! 
 What are you doing? 
 You wouldn't answer my calls, and your dad keeps closing the door on me, so I, uh... 
 You decided to go all stalker on me and climb through my window? 
 Please, just hear me out. 
 I don't know what came over me this week.

 No, no, I meant that as a compliment, but lately I can't say anything right. 
 Like yesterday I kept saying the opposite of what I meant. 
 It's like I was under a spell or something. 
 What? No, definitely not mine. 
 I mean, I can't cast spells. 
 That's totally preposterous. 
 See what I mean? 
 You're funny, you're strange, and you're unpredictable. 
 And now that I think I can say what I mean, I wanted to tell you that... 
 I think about you all the time, and I want to go out with you. 
 What about Maddie? 
 I'm going to talk to her, and I'm gonna tell her that it's over for good. 
 You know, she didn't used to be like this, but lately all she does is lie and manipulate. 
 But you're different. 
 See, with you, what you see is what you get, and I love that. 
 Danny, me too, really, but if we're gonna go out, I have to tell you the truth. 
 Whatever it is, you can tell me. 
 I promise I won't judge you. 
 Sorry, Lily. 
 I'm a... 
 Hello? 
 Who is that? 
 Wait. 
 I'll come down. Oh, oh, oh. 
 Emma? 
 Wait. 
 She sounds familiar. 
 Emma? 
 Nurse Lily?

 (knocking) 
 I got it. I got it. 
 Hey, Mrs. Miller. 
 Hi, boys. 
 Hi. 
 Is Daniel home? 
 Oh, Daniel is across the street at Emma's. 
 Oh. 
 Uh, can we wait for him here? 
 Sure. 
 Make yourselves at home. 
 Whatcha you reading? 
 Whatcha you doing? 
 We are making cookies for Tommy's birthday party tomorrow, aren't we? 
 We, I mean, he, is getting an iguana. 
 He is? 
 Cool. 
 That's what mom said. 
 Christine, I thought we decided... 
 Let's take this calm and civil conversation into the living room. 
 Can we help? 
 Whoa! 
 Uh, so Tommy's birthday party. 
 Room for two more? 
 No. 
 But we're the life of every party. 
 Mel, come help me get the decorations out of the garage. 
 Don't touch anything. 
 Stop that. 
 Huh? Uh! 
 Hide the evidence. 
 What are you doing? 
 My cookies. 
 You found the Hexerin and you didn't tell me? 
 Why would you do that? 
 What's the big deal? 
 Now we have it, and now we know who the chosen one is. 
 All we have to do is wait for the eclipse, and we're golden. 
 Just like that, huh? 
 Yup. See? 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 Oh, Maddie, I really thought by now you would have learned that things are never that simple, especially not when the Hexerin is involved. 
 I got the book like you asked. 
 What more do you want from me? 
 I want you to understand how serious this is and that keeping secrets from me can be dangerous. 
 Okay, okay, I get it. 
 Good. 
 (Gasps) Hey, my shoes. 
 I am holding on to them... 
 (Gasps) 
 Until you can prove that I can trust you. 
 But they're my favorite pair. 
 I know. 
 Ha ha ha ha ha. 
 You two know each other, like, outside of school? 
 She's my... My... 
 Her cousin's brother's sister's stepson's aunt. 
 Francisco, I mean, cousin Francisco invited me over for dinner, so why don't I go to the kitchen and start making a salad. 
 So what were you about to tell me? 
 Uh, nothing important. 
 Well, it sounded important, something about telling me the truth. 
 Cousin Francisco just texted me that he's on the way home, so, you, young man, need to leave right out the window you came in through. 
 How do you know I came through the window? 
 I didn't, but now I do. 
 Oh, you're one of those adults... 
 Yep. 
 Okay, we'll talk tomorrow? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Great timing. 
 Why did you come over here? 
 So we could come up with a plan to get the Hexerin back. 
 I've got to get you ready for the eclipse. 
 How did you get in here? 
 I have a key. 
 To my house? 
 Standard-issue guardian's kit. 
 It's got everything I need to keep an eye on you. 
 That's really cool. 
 Just don't let Andi see it, or the Hexerin won't be the only thing missing. 
 And I got here just in time. 
 You were about to tell Daniel about your powers. 
 No, I wasn't. 
 You're right. 
 You are a bad liar. 
 How did you know I was lying? 
 I didn't, but now I do. 
 You are one of those adults. 
 Listen, Emma, I know you want to be honest with everyone, but sometimes it's necessary to keep secrets. 
 Not only do you risk... 
 Emma, I'm home. 
 Want to order pizza? Uhoh. 
 My dad will be super suspicious if he finds you here. 
 You're right. 
 I'll follow Daniel's lead and use the window. 
 Hey, em, anchovy pizza with extra ham? 
 Em, send me somewhere else. 
 Okay, um... 
 Like an invisible wave that goes by, send Lily to iridium high. 
 How much time do we have? 
 About 15 minutes. 
 Then we need to run back to school before lunch is over. 
 I wanted to talk to you in person, but since you keep calling me. 
 I just don't understand, Daniel, we just got back together, and you're already breaking up with me? 
 But I don't want to hurt you. 
 You've never broken up with me. 
 I always break up with you. 
 You're playing my part. 
 Well, things change. 
 This conversation is over. 
 Maddie. 
 I just hung up with you. 
 I can't hear you talking now. 
 Come on, Maddie. 
 Fine. 
 Since you're playing my part, I'll play yours. 
 I'm so sorry, Maddie. 
 Please take me back. 
 This is where you play me. 
 Say, "okay, I forgive you. 
 Now let's get back together." 
 You really want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you? 
 You obviously want to be with me. 
 There couldn't possibly be anybody else you'd want to be with. 
 Is there? 
 Um... 
 This is where you say "no," and even if the answer's yes, you lie and say "no." 
 No, this is when I say yes and mean it because yes, there is someone else and that someone is Emma. 
 Wow. 
 Danny, you'll regret this! 
 That is so unlike Daniel. 
 He never stands up to Maddie and... 
 Wait! 
 Ahh! 
 So my parents are interviewing for a new cashier at the seven, and the first guy that they interviewed was a funny Irish guy, Andy o'Daniel. 
 Daniel? Did you say Daniel? 
 Could you be a little more obvious? 
 I think they interviewed my neighbor too. 
 Manny. Danny? Did you say Danny? 
 Okay, what's the deal, Emma? 
 Nothing. 
 I just wanted to borrow Daniel's notes on yesterday's English class. 
 Here, you can use mine. 
 I take really good notes. 
 They're sorted, index color-coded, footnoted, sticky-noted. 
 Oh, so you won't mind if I use them? 
 No, give them back. 
 Give them back. Give them back. 
 No. 
 Ow! 
 Watch it. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't think it would actually... 
 Ugh. 
 Is that an icicle hanging from your nose? 
 His nose is super runny. 
 That looks more like frostbite or something. 
 (Gasps) Yes, that's what it is. 
 Here, um, let me take you to the nurse's office. 
 The oatmeal's not coming off. 
 You might just have to accept that this is your new look. 
 I'd call it "blueberry chic." 
 (Sighs) 
 Wait, why don't you just cast a spell? 
 (Gasps) 
 That's right. 
 I can fix this, and I can rid the world of that little vermilion that is Emma. 
 I think you mean vermin. 
 Vermilion is a shade of red derived from the cinnabar ore, which... 
 Come on, panthers, we're going on a witch hunt. 
 
 
 
 (Thunder clapping) 
 There she is. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Step back, panthers. 
 This is what I've been practicing for. 
 Hot summer days full of... 
 Daniel? 
 He's gonna ruin it. 
 Nothing's ruined. 
 Daniel will just have to suffer with her. 
 What are you going to do? 
 Turn them into frogs? 
 You call that a good idea? 
 Frogs? 
 That's totally lame. 
 Hot summer days full of bees and snakes. 
 I don't think you want to do that. 
 And all she wanted to do was make this crazy glitter collage and... 
 You are wasting my time, miss van pelt. 
 I want specifics. 
 What happened? 
 I could suddenly see from my ears. 
 I turned you into a frog. 
 Gross. 
 I don't still have a frog chin, do I? 
 Let's start over, and no more babbling. 
 The other girl, is she a witch, too? 
 Do you mean, um, gigi? 
 No, and don't try to be cute. 
 I eat cute for breakfast. 
 I mean the math teacher's daughter. 
 Oh, her. 
 Why do you have so many frogs? 
 They're slimy, yucky, and croak-like. 
 Let's try this one more time. 
 Is Emma a witch, too? 
 Ribbit once for yes or twice for no. 
 So it's a small party and will probably end in disaster, but it should be fun until the disaster part. 
 Count me in. 
 Seriously? 
 Sure, why not? 
 My other options are watching my dad burn a meat loaf and then ordering pizza or playing  zombie invasion armageddon smorgasbord with Andi. 
 Daniel, so glad we found you. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You're not supposed to be at high school. 
 We took a sabbatini from school today. 
 A what? 
 I think he means a sabbatical, a fancy term for skip school. 
 Okay, why would you do that? 
 Mom and dad are going to be furious. 
 Say good-bye to your new iguana. 
 Yes, I knew I was gonna get one. 
 Here's the thing, we set up a small prank, and we might have gone too far with it. 
 How far? 
 We covered Maddie with oatmeal. 
 No way! 
 I mean, bad, so bad. 
 And what have we here? 
 One of you want to explain this? 
 Sure. 
 Uh, this is an "icicle." 
 This is his "nose," and the icicle is stuck to it. 
 And I tried pulling it off, but it stuck. 
 Did you try burping on it to melt it? 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 How would burping melt? 
 I'll take care of it. 
 You can go back to class now. 
 Nah, I'm cool. I'll stay here. 
 Oh, because you're so worried about him, and you want to make sure that he's okay, and he can't possibly make it without you. 
 Yeah. 
 Nice try. Go back to class now. 
 Okay. 
 Come on, panthers. 
 She knows, doesn't she about your... 
 (Croak) 
 I mean, um, she totally gave me the third degree. 
 What did you tell her? 
 Oh, not that much about me. 
 Then about Emma? 
 I may have let a couple things slip. 
 About her having the Hexerin? 
 About her being the chosen one? 
 About how much you hate her shoes? 
 Let's just say two out of those three. 
 Let's go, pronto. 
 Ready for practice? 
 We're a couple short today. 
 Yeah, Daniel's m.I.A., and Diego's in the nurse's office. 
 What happened to Diego? 
 Oh, uh, he had an icicle stuck to his nose. 
 Inverted cold. No biggie. 
 And is he still with the nurse? 
 That's where I left him. 
 Okay, uh, I'll take care of him. 
 Um, you guys head to practice and start doing warm-up laps. 
 Go. 
 And you're all set. 
 Oh. 
 Exactly how did you... 
 Diego, swim practice, go now. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 What, wait, wait, you can't just come in here and clear one of my patients. 
 He said he feels fine, and that's all there is to it. 
 No, it's not. 
 I just extracted an icicle from his nose, plus, apparently, he's been burping fire out of his mouth, so... 
 He's fine. 
 I thought they were extinct, but he's got all the signs. 
 Aha. 
 You know. 
 He's got all the signs of being raised by circus folk... 
 Burping fire, sneezing icicles... 
 Standard circus school grammar lessons. 
 So is that what you're going with, circus school? 
 How do you know about the kanays? 
 I've been looking for you. 
 How did you find me? 
 You told the sharks you were coming here after practice. 
 Oh. 
 You didn't use any hocus pocus mumbo jumbo abracadabra? 
 No. 
 I used my phone, which, if you think about it, is magic in itself, don't you think? 
 Why were you looking for me? 
 We have to talk about what happened in school. 
 About you being a witch? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this to you. 
 Do what? 
 I think I know how you know about the kanays. 
 You're a witch, aren't you? 
 Yes, and you are? 
 Uh, nothing. 
 I don't have any powers or anything. 
 Neither do I, but I'm still technically a witch, and if your mother's a witch, then you must be... 
 You know about my mother? 
 She doesn't hide it as well as she might think. 
 You know, if she doesn't want anyone suspecting she's a witch, then she probably shouldn't act exactly like a stereotypical witch. 
 Oh, but that's not an act. 
 That's just her. 
 Like I was saying, if your mother's a witch, then you must be something. 
 I'm not, because I'm adopted. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I never heard of a witch adopting a human. 
 Well, now you have. 
 So he doesn't remember anything? 
 Hmm, I wouldn't say that... 
 Exactly. 
 Erasing somebody's memory can be tricky. 
 You should have taken advantage and wiped out his obsession for magic. 
 (Gasps) Like how I should wipe your obsession with zombies, werewolves, and vampires? 
 Wipe those away, and I could become a panther. 
 Now that is scary. 
 Speaking of which, what's the plan? 
 Once I finish getting ready, we'll walk over to Daniel's for the party. 
 No, no, no, I mean, what's the plan for stealing the Hexerin back? 
 We need it before the eclipse. 
 I know, but let's just go and enjoy the party. 
 There's not much Maddie can do in one night. 
 (Grunting) 
 (Computer ringing) 
 (Gasps) It's Daniel. 
 How do I look? 
 Eh. 
 You look great. 
 And pick that up. That's designer. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Daniel. Hey, Maddie. 
 The terrible three minus one have something to say. 
 It's my birthday, so I don't have to say sorry. 
 That's not it. Do what we practiced. 
 We are really sorry about the blue oatmeal thing. 
 It was you. 
 And we'll pay for dry cleaning your clothes with our allowance. 
 Okay. I forgive them. 
 Now you forgive me, and let's get back together. 
 Sorry, not gonna happen, but thanks for being so understanding. 
 Aah. 
 Hey, everything's ready. 
 After my dad gives Tommy the cake, he'll give him the iguana. 
 He'll love it. 
 He'll never forget his first iguana. 
 Hey, I love this song. 
 I want to dance. 
 You iguana dance with me? 
 You guys are such geeks.

 Both : No! 
 I can't believe he said that. 
 And he wasn't even under the opposite spell, so he must have meant it. 
 He did not mean it. I know it. 
 Let it go, Maddie. 
 The vein in your forehead is alarmingly huge. 
 He's such a... 
 Ah, a reptile. 
 In fact... Maddie. 
 Crocodile, snakes, I'm a female wizard, turn Daniel into a lizard. 
 No, I can't. 
 When we get back together, I can't kiss a former lizard. 
 Are you sure you pulled back in time? 
 Definitely. 
 I'm pretty sure. 
 Maybe. 
 (Sigh) See, it didn't work. 
 He was right here. 
 No, he was on the beanbag. 
 I remember seeing that picture behind him. 
 Oh, you and your photographic memory. 
 (Gasps) 
 What was that? 
 We come in peace. 
 Oh, just... 
 (Gasps) 
 Ahh! 
 Daniel? 
 You did turn Daniel into a lizard. 
 I must be more powerful than I thought. 
 What do we do now? 
 We take him with us.
