 Hey, thanks for helping me search. 
 I'll make my posters tonight. 
 You might want to go easier on the glitter. 
 Hey, the more noticeable the better, right? 
 You're right. I take it back. 
 Glitter your heart out. 
 Hey, you want to walk together to school on Monday? 
 Iguana? 
 Where did you come from? 
 Hey, em, I forgot my jacket. 
 I... I just... 
 Emma, is that iguana? 
 I don't know! 
 It is iguana. 
 Has the same orange on the side of its face as... 
 I'll take your word for it. 
 Why is it here? 
 I don't know. 
 I came in and found it on the couch. 
 Really? 
 Then why do you have an iguana bed and bowl with you? 
 I have no idea where those came from. 
 I'm just as confused as you are. 
 Did you have him this whole time? 
 No, I told you. 
 I came in and found it sitting on the couch. 
 Maybe he waddled in from the wild? 
 Oh, right, yeah, and carried his food bowl and bed with him from the wild. 
 I'm not very well versed in wild iguana behavior, but it's possible. 
 I got to go, and I'm taking iguana back to its rightful owner... Tommy. 
 Danny, wait!

 It's like I can't stop watching them. 
 I know. 
 They're like two lions circling each other. 
 Or more like two lizards. 
 (Gasps) Lizards! That must be it. 
 He must have been that lizard that was in here. 
 I must have accidentally turned him into a human. 
 Wow! 
 Who knew lizards could Dougie? 
 I can teach anyone how to Dougie. 
 Oh, Maddie, can we keep him? Please? 
 Yikes, he's much better at dancing than talking. 
 I don't know. 
 It's one thing to have a boy trapped in a lizard's body, but a lizard trapped in a boy's body? 
 He'll act all bizarre, and everyone will notice. 
 (Both laugh) 
 Not if he's with Sophie. 
 Good point. 
 We'll get you another iguana. 
 I don't want another iguana. 
 I want iguana. 
 But since you never actually met iguana, won't another iguana be just as good? 
 I could feel his presence in the house. 
 Another iguana won't have the same presence. 
 Tommy, guess who I found. 
 Iguana? 
 You found him. 
 Is it really him? 
 Yep, I checked. 
 And fyi, iguana's a her, not a him. 
 Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
 So you came home, and it was just sitting on the couch. 
 Yes. 
 And where was your father? 
 He's at his meeting with the other big brains, all enjoying having bigger brains than everyone else. 
 So it couldn't have been him. 
 Of course not. 
 Why would he do that anyway? 
 You mean what could have been his motive? 
 Well, he does hate Daniel with a fiery passion of angry villagers going after a poor, misunderstood vampire. 
 What... 
 I know this dog bed. 
 You do? 
 Yes. (Sniffs) 
 It was Sophie's. 
 It belonged to her dog, Maria Conchita, when she was a puppy. 
 How do you know that? 
 I know things. 
 And not because it says "Maria Conchita" on it? 
 No. 
 This could have been anyone's dog bed. 
 Maria Conchita's a very popular dog name. 
 Oh, wait. 
 Now I get it. 
 I know what happened! 
 Me too. 
 Let's say it at the same time. 
 Why? If we both know... 
 Because it'll be fun. Okay, let's do it. 
 Three, two, one. 
 Maddie and her minions stole the iguana and planted it here to frame me! 
 Frame you! 
 Oh, of course! 
 That's it. 
 I'm officially mad! 
 You are? 
 Yes, and they're going to pay! 
 Yeah! Get your angry on! 
 Oh, we're so gonna get you, Maddie! 
 Yeah, we are! 
 And then we're gonna... 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 Stop, stop! 
 If this is what your anger looks like, we're in trouble. 
 Katie! 
 Do I have to go to tae Kwon do today, mom? 
 I'm tired. 
 Tae Kwon do? 
 You take tae Kwon do? 
 Huh? 
 What? 
 No, I must have been dreaming. 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 It's okay. 
 You can admit it. 
 Tae Kwon do is cool. 
 Really? Then yeah, I have a yellow belt. 
 (Speaking foreign language) 
 Busted! 
 Too easy. 
 Uh, so have you found something yet? 
 No! Nothing. 
 Just a whole bunch of spells that either make no sense or are useless, not one spell to turn sneakers into manolos. 
 I hate this book! 
 Help me! 
 Ow! 
 Someone get me a mirror, stat! 
 Calm down. 
 Your nose is still there. 
 It's just really big and red, like Rudolph's. 
 (Laughs) 
 Oh, forget it. 
 I am so through with magic for the night. 
 Good, because Bo is hungry and needs a place to sleep. 
 Your pantry will be good for both those things. 
 Bo? 
 Short for bouillabaisse. 
 It's a great name and a delicious plate of food. 
 I told you not to name him. 
 Don't get too attached. 
 I did more than that. 
 Watch this. 
 Bo, fetch! 
 And that's not all. 
 It works both ways. 
 (Laughing) 
 It's weird, but it's like they're soul mates. 
 Make sure you leave the iguana in your room with the door closed, Tommy. 
 I should probably stay home with him. 
 He's been through a traumatic experience. 
 Don't even think about it. 
 (Doorbell rings) 
 Who was it? 
 No one. 
 (Frantic knocking at door) 
 Yeah, that doesn't sound like no one. 
 Sounds like someone annoying, someone like... 
 Good morning, Millers. 
 Exactly. 
 Maddie, what are you doing here so early? 
 I read in miss information's blog that you found iguana. 
 Yeah, we did. 
 Good. 
 I need to talk to you about that. 
 I'm all ears. 
 I know, but I never wanted to say anything and hurt your feelings. 
 They're huge! 
 I meant tell me. 
 Oh. 
 (Clears throat) Right. 
 This is difficult, but I think Emma took your iguana. 
 You wanted to see me, coach? 
 Yeah. Take a seat. 
 I wanted to ask you something. 
 So you know you have some powers? 
 Oh, yeah, it's so cool, except when it flies out of control. 
 Then it's super cool. 
 You really can't let them fly out of control. 
 You know what you are? 
 You said something about a canned eye. 
 No. 
 You're a churi kanay, k-a-n-a-y. 
 It means son of fire. Cool! 
 It's a very old tribe that everyone thought was extinct, but you might be the last of them, the last of the kanays. 
 Danny, can we talk? 
 I'm ready to explain about yesterday. 
 My brother cried all night. 
 He felt so guilty that he lost the iguana, and all this time, you had him. 
 I didn't! I promise. 
 Then how did he get into your house complete with a food bowl and a bed? 
 I think Maddie put him there. 
 Maddie? 
 Okay, now you're really reaching. 
 I mean, Maddie has done some pretty shady stuff, but she had nothing to do with this. 
 She wasn't even at the party! 
 That doesn't mean she couldn't have taken iguana. 
 How would she get into your house, magic? 
 As a matter of fact... 
 Yes. 
 Daniel, the truth is... 
 I am... 
 The truth is, I'm... 
 The next word out of your mouth better be "sorry," because you should be. 
 Both : I know what you did! 
 You took the iguana! 
 What? That's outrageous. 
 I have an airtight alibi. 
 I was home all night watching poodle shih tzus in tiaras,  an expose into the world of dog competitions. 
 You can ask my mom. 
 We both know that doesn't prove anything. 
 You could have just... Sent it to my house. 
 What do you mean by "sent it"? 
 Yeah, seriously. 
 You're so guilty, you can't even come up with a good lie. 
 Or I just can't make lying look as good as some people. 
 (Gasps) 
 Not that I'm lying. 
 I'm just saying I don't lie very much, so I'd be bad at it if I did. 
 She's doing this so we won't get back together, Daniel. 
 No, that's what you're doing! 
 Not the getting back together part, since we never broke up or, like, officially dated. 
 You were never officially or unofficially dating. 
 Can you guys stop fighting? 
 I just want the truth. 
 And I'm giving it to you. 
 The truth is... 
 You wouldn't dare. 
 The truth is, we're both... 
 Uh, not responsible. 
 
 
 
 Tony? 
 What do you want? 
 Did you lose a dove or a bunny or something? 
 I've never lost a dove or a bunny! 
 I did lose a baby chick one time, but... 
 Can you get to the point, Tony? 
 Right. 
 I know exactly what happened with iguana. 
 I know that Emma did not take the iguana. 
 She wouldn't do that. 
 And anyone who really knows her would know that. 
 Thanks, Tony. 
 Yeah, yeah, very romantic. 
 Nerd love is so adorable. 
 Come on, Daniel. Let's go. 
 That doesn't prove anything. 
 I mean, I want it to be true, but I know what I saw. 
 And I know what I feel! 
 Plus, I know that Emma didn't take the iguana, because I was the one who found him. 
 All : You did? 
 I called Daniel to tell him, but he never answered, so I took him over to Emma's to wait. 
 You did not. 
 How would you know? 
 Because... 
 Because... 
 How'd you get into Emma's house? 
 Mr. Alonzo let me in. 
 Where'd you get the bowl and the bed? 
 I stopped by my house first. 
 Aha! 
 Why didn't you leave it at your house? 
 My mom's terrified of reptiles. 
 Why didn't you take it to Daniel's? 
 I knew Emma felt really bad about leaving the garage door open, so I wanted her to be the one to bring it back. 
 (Groans) 
 Thanks, man. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 It all makes sense now. 
 Kind of. 
 Whoa. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, man! 
 I just sent "your armpits smell disarming" to Mac. 
 Sorry about the ambush, but I really need to talk to you. 
 Me? What did I do? 
 Nothing. And that's the problem. 
 You and Emma are doing nothing. 
 You're not getting the Hexerin back. 
 She's not magic training. 
 You're not helping. 
 All right, all right, hold the phone. 
 I'm not the guardian. You are. 
 I'm just a friend. 
 Exactly. 
 And Emma's in a lot of danger, Andi. 
 Ah, danger. 
 I mean, we can take Maddie. 
 I could take Maddie by myself. 
 Maddie's not the only one planning on stealing her powers. 
 I think there's someone way more powerful and evil after them. 
 More evil than Maddie? 
 Not high school evil, real evil evil. 
 What can I do? 
 I don't have powers. 
 I'm just some random girl. 
 Nothing is ever random, and you're more prepared for this than any of us. 
 You're fearless, and you're resourceful. 
 Oh, that I am. 
 You think you can butter me up so I'll be persuaded to help you? 
 No. 
 I think you'll help me because Emma's your friend. 
 How much trouble is em in? 
 If we don't get the Hexerin back and get Emma prepared, you may not be friends for much longer. 
 Don't worry. I got this. 
 Em will be right on track in no time. 
 Thank you for whatever that was. 
 It was the truth, right? 
 You didn't have to do that. 
 But I wanted to. 
 I know you would never steal the iguana or anything else. 
 You're too good. 
 I'm not as good as you think. 
 I'll tell you how the iguana got there if you want. 
 No, I trust you. 
 You would never hurt anybody. 
 Thank you. 
 So how does coach know so much about being a kanay? 
 I don't know. I didn't ask. 
 Hey, can you toast these for me? 
 I feel like some roasted nuts. 
 Eh. 
 Nah, I'm good. 
 Just a few in your hand, and pass them over. 
 I'd rather not. 
 Why? 
 Because someone might see me, and Julio said not to call any attention to myself. 
 You think you're so cool just because you can make fire? 
 Well, guess what. 
 So can anyone rubbing two sticks together. 
 Why are you being like this? 
 I just can't share all of my superpower stuff with you because, well, you don't have any. 
 No, I didn't... I see. 
 Well, you know what I do have? 
 Trail mix, and I'm not sharing. 
 Mac! 
 Dude, come on! 
 Wow, I'm impressed. 
 I mean, only thing I've ever seen Tony stand up to was a squirrel sitting on his bike, and the squirrel won. 
 Yeah, I was totally surprised. 
 Really? 
 I mean, he obviously likes you, you know, even though you... 
 His... 
 Yeah. 
 Kind of makes you think you can trust him, huh? 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 No. 
 It's best if he doesn't know, and you got to be careful people don't see you casting spells. 
 That's a switch. 
 What happened to the Andi who just wanted to have fun with magic? 
 That Andi realized how much trouble you're in. 
 Wow, you sound exactly like Lily. 
 Yeah, well, maybe she has a point. 
 I mean, you could really lose your powers, em. 
 Would that really be so bad? 
 Then I could just be a regular girl worrying about boys and clothes, not disappearing iguanas and monkey nurses. 
 Okay, I don't get it. 
 Do you even want your powers? 
 I didn't say that. 
 It's just I'm not sure I'm gonna get to keep them. 
 Okay, maybe not, but you have to at least fight for them, but you're not even trying! 
 I mean, you have this amazing gift, this unreal power, and these people, witches counting on you. 
 I didn't ask for any of that! 
 I know, but sometimes you have to step up and take charge! 
 You have to own who you are! 
 It's like you don't even care. 
 Hey, Emma. 
 Mr. Alonzo. 
 Hi, guys. 
 Can we talk to you for a minute? 
 That depends. 
 Is cake batter, cereal, or spaghetti about to fall on me? 
 What? 
 It's fine, dad. 
 See you inside in a bit. 
 Oh, okay. 
 This is for you. 
 It's a thank-you. 
 A thank-you? 
 For finding iguana. 
 Daniel told us last night that you were the one that found him. 
 He did? 
 So we all made this as a thank-you. 
 The silver balls go here and there. 
 Push this. 
 Wow. Thanks, guys! 
 Why'd your mom make you bring him to school? 
 Since I can't open the Hexerin to find a spell to change him back, she's making me take responsibility for my actions. 
 So lame. 
 Well, maybe the principal will put him in kindergarten since he doesn't know how to do anything. 
 That's not true! 
 I've been teaching him calculus, quantum physics, and knitting. 
 Look at this hat he made me. 
 He's admitted. 
 He's your second cousin from France who was raised by wolves and speaks no English. 
 Have fun. 
 I had no idea you speak French. 
 That explains everything. 
 (Speaking French) 
 Huh! That is bad. 
 That is real bad. 
 I know. 
 I can't believe I accused her of stealing my iguana. 
 That's bad. 
 That's real bad. 
 I said I know. 
 Can you focus on helping me get out of this? 
 I don't know. 
 You dug yourself a deep hole, and you included Maddie in it? 
 Huh! That is bad. 
 That is real... I know! 
 (Sighs) 
 You know, I'm just gonna have to apologize. 
 And... and I'm gonna have to invite her to the beach ball volleyball game on Saturday. 
 Great idea, 'cause all girls want to go out with you after you accuse them of stealing reptiles. 
 Well, I'm gonna take my chances. 
 Wish me luck. 
 And don't eat too much; we have practice later. 
 I know. Duh. 
 Hello, Diego. 
 Eaten any canned eyes lately? 
 I think Emma and Andi are in a fight. 
 You do? Why? 
 I just saw them in the hallway, and they weren't speaking to each other, and you know how chatty Emma is. 
 Really? 
 This just got interesting. 
 What are you going to do? 
 'Cause we have a long list of people to get back at, starting with Tony. 
 Forget Tony. 
 We have bigger fish to fry. 
 Okay, it's got to be the queen of hearts. 
 Nope. 
 Ace of spades? 
 You've pulled out, like, the entire deck. 
 I mean, it's actually a miracle you haven't guessed it yet. 
 Okay, this has to be your card. 
 "Beach ball Saturday?" 
 Not it either. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, my card was the nine of diamonds. 
 No, look again. 
 I'm pretty sure that's your card. 
 Tony, I'm telling you, this isn't... 
 No, it's your card that I made for you, okay? 
 I'm asking if you want to go to the beach ball on Saturday together. 
 Would you look who it is? 
 It's Andi. 
 What happened to you? 
 Lose one of your drill bits? 
 Very funny. 
 Leave me alone. 
 You are alone, which is strange. 
 Yeah. 
 Where's your little friend? 
 Oh, wait. That's right. 
 I saw you two this morning, and you weren't talking. 
 You guys get in a fight or something? 
 Oh, she got in a fight, and now she has no friends. 
 Boo-hoo. 
 Leave me alone, or I'll lose one of my drill bits in your ear! 
 I know what you need. 
 You need new friends, friends like us. 
 I'd rather be fed to zombies. 
 But you loves zombies, so you would love us. 
 Do it. 
 Do it. Do it. 
 Just like Sophie, Katie, and me, a panther you shall be. 
 Why am I wearing this outfit and these shoes? 
 Get me out of these, stat!
