 Hello, Mr. Miller. So nice to see you. 
 Is Daniel home? 
 Hi, Maddie. 
 It's been a while since I've seen you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We're eating dinner right now, but... 
 Great! I brought dessert. 
 Homemade pecan pie. 
 Oh, no. 
 Here, Maddie, let me take that to the kitchen. 
 No! Uh, I mean... 
 It's okay. I got it. 
 Hello, Millers... 
 And emmy minaj. 
 Hi, Maddie. 
 Love your new look. 
 Maddie, hey. What are you doing here? 
 Oh, I brought you a pie. Homemade. 
 Oh, thank you, Maddie. 
 I didn't even know you baked. 
 Are you kidding? 
 I love baking. 
 You do? 
 Oh, Daniel, how quickly you forget. 
 Why don't you have a piece? 
 Oh, yeah. There you go. 
 It's a little mushy, but there you go. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, and here's the crust. 
 Let me help you with that. 
 Okay. 
 The best piece is always the first piece. 
 Thanks, but I think we should wait till after dinner. 
 But it's fresh out of the oven. 
 It'll taste its best right now. 
 I'll take a piece now. 
 No! Uh, I mean, it's okay. 
 Daniel's right. 
 We should probably eat dinner first. 
 I guess I'll get you a plate. 
 I'm on to you.

 All right, let's just get on with it. 
 So you gonna saw her in half? 
 No, that was so last year. 
 Oh. Oh, so what are we gonna do? 
 The old switcheroo? 
 I duck in and come out the other side? 
 I'm gonna cut you in half with this... 
 Laser. 
 Way cool. 
 Oh, no way. Get me out of this thing! 
 Where did you get this? 
 My dad brought it home from work. 
 It's nasa-graded. 
 You shouldn't have that. I should... 
 Don't worry. It's safe. 
 Oh! 
 Okay. Oh! 
 Turn it off! 
 Get away from me. 
 But it... 
 That's good, right? Right? 
 Whoo! 
 Oh, gosh. 
 Oh, God. 
 Here comes trouble times three. 
 Hey, guys. 
 I had no idea you'd be here. 
 Where's your ring leader and sidekick? 
 Why? 
 It's not like we travel as a pack everywhere we go. 
 Yeah, you do. 
 Well, they sent me here to bring you this pie as a peace offering from the Panthers to the sharks. 
 Yeah, right. 
 It's probably got crickets baked into it. 
 Good. 
 Katie, can you get me some pie? 
 No. 
 Get me some pie! 
 Daniel, have some pie! 
 Pecan. 
 Oh, um... 
 Let's finish clearing the table first, yes? 
 Can I help? 
 No, no, no. You're our guest. 
 Yeah, sit down. 
 You wouldn't want to get those pink extensions dirty. 
 If I had known this was a costume party, I would have... 
 Oh, wait. 
 You're the only one in a costume. 
 So this is just you being totally weird. 
 No. 
 I just, uh... 
 I can't get it off. 
 Oh, I get it. 
 You cast a spell to look like me, and you got it all wrong. 
 You've got me! 
 And I did get it wrong. 
 I was supposed to look way uglier. 
 Oh, that's it, you... 
 Uh, have to come over and learn how to bake some pies. 
 No! 
 Hiyah! No! Give me! It's mine! 
 Ow! 
 What was that? 
 Come here. 
 I just wanted some pie. 
 And Maddie went all tae Kwon do on me. 
 That's because the pie... 
 It's pecan, and Tommy's allergic to pecans. 
 No, I'm not! 
 I just saved your life! 
 You're welcome. 
 Katie? Baked something? 
 And you ate it? 
 Yeah, it was actually pretty good. 
 What's wrong? Are you okay? 
 Pretty Katie. 
 Pretty Katie. 
 Diego, snap out of it. 
 Talk to me. 
 Now if only I could get this outfit off. 
 You could just cast another spell to reverse this one. 
 No way. 
 I don't want it going wrong and end up looking crazier than this. 
 I'm going old-school, brillo pads and scissors. 
 Well, good luck. 
 I'm out. See you tomorrow. 
 ♪ 
 Wow. 
 Wow! 
 Wah! 
 Why are you doing this to me? 
 Oh, wow. 
 Zoom in. Zoom in. 
 Real subtle. 
 Hey there, Emma. 
 How's it, uh, going? 
 Hi, Gigi. 
 Couldn't be better. 
 This is Miss Information reporting live. 
 There's got to be some kind of witch help line or something. 
 Take the poll on whether you love this outfit or totally hate it. 
 This is Miss Information signing off. 
 Let me guess. The glamour spell? 
 Yup. 
 I've seen worse... 
 Witches using the glamour spell to look like Cher, ke$ha, Lady Gaga in the meat dress... 
 So where is it? Where's what? 
 The hexerin. You found it, didn't you? 
 How did you know? 
 You just told me. 
 Hey! You tricked me! 
 Just 'cause I don't have magic powers doesn't mean I don't know how to pull a few tricks. 
 Wow, how long have you been waiting to say that one? 
 About five years. 
 Anyway, don't worry about the hexerin. 
 I put it in a very safe place. 
 Good. Keep it there. 
 Is that the he... 
 Surprise! 
 I managed to salvage a piece, but Daniel didn't want it. 
 Anyway, it doesn't matter. The spell didn't work. 
 How can you be sure? 
 Tommy ate some from the floor, and he clearly was not in love with me afterwards. 
 I'm sure it worked. 
 Maybe Tommy just hates you so much that eating the pie just made him hate you less. 
 Ha! Glad we solved that mystery. 
 Now, where were we? 
 Hey, Maddie, I think one of your eyebrows is longer than the other! 
 Oh, I'm gonna kill Sammy! 
 Katie, hi. 
 I have been looking everywhere for you. 
 Did you do something new with your hair? 
 No, she just looks good all the time. 
 Let me walk you to class. 
 And I could hold your books for you. 
 Oh! 
 What is this, the '5os? 
 I'll walk you to class and program my digits into your phone as your number one in your fave five. 
 Gentlemen, please. 
 There's no need to fight. 
 You both can walk me... 
 To class. 
 
 
 
 ♪ 
 She switched the pies! 
 Katie! You switched the... 
 Now, stay. 
 What happened to your amazing new hideous look? 
 Got tired of it. So I changed. 
 Oh, I thought it was stuck on because you're terrible at magic. 
 Guess I'm better than you thought. 
 What was that? 
 You're hiding something. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! How did you do that? 
 Puh-lease. 
 You think I got where I am today without knowing how to break in to people's lockers? 
 What is that? 
 I like glitter, so Sue me. 
 Wait, my mom, she was talking about the book that glows, the huh-hee-hi-erin. 
 I-I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You have it, the arrrrrr-erin. 
 Oh, you're killing me. Hexerin. 
 It's hexerin. 
 You have it! 
 Give it! 
 You can't get away with this anymore, so now your feet are glued to the floor. 
 Wait for me. I'll be right there. 
 Locker, locker, open sesame. 
 Get me out of here as fast as a bee. 
 I'll be more careful. I promise you. 
 But for now, this spell will undo. 
 Thank you, Lily. 
 Nice try. 
 But you'd have to wake up pretty early in the morning to fool me. 
 Justin Timberlake! 
 Where? Where? 
 Gotcha! You're trapped. 
 Go away or... or I'll use the book. 
 Yeah, right. 
 You don't know how to use the hee-honx-on. 
 I do too know how to use the hee-honx-on. 
 ♪ 
 What's going on in here? 
 Nothing! 
 So let's try this again. 
 What's going on here? 
 Nothing! 
 Mm-hmm. Fine. 
 Then get back to class. 
 But I am watching you. 
 Both of you! 
 Fish filet? Really? 
 It rhymed, didn't it? 
 Something strange happened in here. 
 And you're gonna tell me what. 
 I don't know what I saw. 
 Yes, you do. 
 Try and remember. 
 And maybe I'll have a talk with your teachers and let them know what a wonderful and cooperative student you are. 
 Well, I saw Maddie and Emma. 
 They ran into one of the lockers, and then they came out another locker down the hall. 
 Really? 
 Did either of them have a big, bright book with them? 
 I don't know. 
 Think! 
 Yes! Yes, they did. 
 I knew it. 
 Please, don't call my parents. 
 Now, why would I do that... 
 When I can do this? 
 What a lovely frog you make, Sebastian. 
 Mm, you're gonna be so nice in my collection. 
 And another one bites the dust. 
 We can't risk anybody being suspicious about you. 
 Even if it means lying? 
 You have to. 
 Historically, people haven't been all that accepting about witches. 
 We already had that Salem incident due to one blabbermouth. 
 I don't like to lie. 
 I'm not very good at it. 
 Actually, I'm terrible. 
 I get nervous, so I overcompensate with too many details that end up not making sense. 
 Well, try to keep the lying to a minimum. 
 But you have to be very careful. 
 In the past, the chosen one is further along by now, but since your mom is... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know this is hard. 
 But you're way behind, and I have to make sure no one suspects you're a witch. 
 Then I should probably tell you that the principal might have seen me and Maddie cast spells at each other. 
 What? When? 
 Right after our locker escapade. 
 Maddie tried to turn me into a fish filet, and I cast one of the blocking spells you taught me. 
 And the principal seemed suspicious? 
 Yes, but... 
 Almost not suspicious enough, like she didn't seem that surprised by what we were doing. 
 Hmm. 
 I've gotten a weird vibe from her since my first day. 
 She seems to be hiding something. 
 I know, and that frog aquarium in her office is just plain weird. 
 Oh, and another strange thing... 
 Becky's overnight transformation, I'm pretty sure was a beep and a boop. 
 What's a beep and a boop? 
 Getting her ears pinned back. 
 That's a thing now? 
 What about that new girl, Emma alonzo? 
 Anything odd about her? 
 Besides not reading my blog that much, she seems pretty normal. 
 She hangs out with Andi Cruz a lot. 
 That's not very interesting, certainly not unrestricted hall pass worthy. 
 I'm sure I can dig up something. 
 Everybody's got a secret. 
 Right? 
 Even you. 
 Like how you name all your frogs after students who suddenly, poof, transferred out of this school. 
 Did you... 
 Um, hello, principal. 
 May I come in? 
 You can go. 
 Is that hall pass offer still on the table? 
 Now! 
 You didn't have to be so harsh to her, mom. 
 With two of the most popular guys in school after me, it's only a matter of time before my stock skyrockets and I become more popular than Maddie. 
 I don't play the stock market. 
 It's too volatile. 
 Your shares are up, then down. 
 Then your broker tells you to buy, buy, buy when you know you should sell, sell, sell. 
 Katie, I got your lunch. 
 No. 
 I did. 
 Oh. 
 Ugh! 
 Oh, no, I'm so sorry. 
 Look what you did. 
 I... 
 It's okay. 
 I don't mind a little cereal on me. 
 It's... it's good for your complexion. 
 Mine's better. 
 Boys! Please! 
 This fighting over me has gotten out of control. 
 Something is definitely fishy about that new girl Emma. 
 Getting stuck in the bathroom, then magically ending up in the pool? 
 Like you just said, she's new. 
 Maybe she just got confused. 
 But then I caught her trying to cast a spell with that... 
 That Jaguar. 
 You mean Panther? 
 You know who I'm taking about. 
 That cheerleader. Maddie. 
 You think they're witches? 
 Well, you know what they say. 
 That walks like a witch and talks like a witch must be a witch. 
 Even if they are, we should just leave them alone. 
 We have a pretty good thing going at this school. 
 Please. 
 We've come here for much bigger, better, and more powerful things, didn't we? 
 Well, that depends on your definition of bigger, better, and more powerful. 
 For me, there's nothing bigger or better than winning nationals. 
 But maybe for you, there's something else, like... 
 Taking over the world? 
 I was thinking winning best school in the state, but... 
 Oh, Julio. 
 You've always been so simple-minded. 
 Lucky for you, you have me to broaden your horizons. 
 Ready or not? 
 I choose not. 
 Okay. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, I have an empty box. 
 I'm in the box, Sherlock. 
 I have a Andi in this box, and I will make this Andi disappear. 
 Now watch. She'll still be in there. 
 Like the moon when it becomes dawn, let Andi from the box be gone. 
 Zap! 
 Abracadabra! 
 She's gone? 
 I mean, yes, and she's gone. 
 Where'd she go? 
 A magician never reveals his secrets. 
 Pick a card, any card. 
 Zap! 
 Whoa! 
 Are you ready yet? 
 This outfit is wack. I can't go out there. 
 I was Nicki minaj for two days. 
 You're going out there. 
 Andi, you're up. 
 No way. I'm gonna be humiliated. 
 But I can't do the trick without you. 
 Nobody else fits inside the secret compartment... 
 I mean, the...Suitcase. 
 Don't worry, Tony. 
 Andi won't bail on you. 
 You better get out there. 
 Oh, no. 
 I was walking at too quick of pace, so please fix my mistake and repair this vase. 
 Zap! 
 I forgot my sheet. 
 How did you do that?
