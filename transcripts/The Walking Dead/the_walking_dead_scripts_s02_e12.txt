 Previously on AMC's 
 The Walking Dead... 
 If you wanna kill me, you're gonna have to do better than a wrench. 
 He's just a kid! 
 We reconvene at sunset, then what happens, happens. 
 Isn't there anybody else who's gonna stand with me? 
 This is a young man's life! 
 Do it. 
 Take him away. 
 Do something! 
 Sorry, brother. 
 Dale could-- 
 could get under your skin. He sure got under mine, because he wasn't afraid  to say exactly what he thought, how he felt. That kind of honesty is rare and brave. Whenever I'd make a decision, I'd look at Dale. He'd be looking back at me with that look he had. We've all seen it one time or another. I couldn't always read him,  but he could read us. He saw people for who they were. He knew things about us-- The truth... Who we really are. In the end, he was talking about losing our humanity. He said this group was broken. The best way to honor him is to unbreak it. Set aside our differences and pull together, st feeling sorry for ourselves and take control of our lives... Our safety... ...our future. We're not broken. We're gonna prove him wrong. From now on... We're gonna do it his way. That is how we honor Dale. It'll be tight, 14 people in one house. Don't worry about that. With the swamp hardening, the creek drying up... With 50 head of cattle on the property, we might as well be ringing a damn dinner bell. She's right. We should've moved you in a while ago. All right, let's move the vehicles near each of the doors facing out toward the road. Just leave it there. We'll build a lookout in the windmill, another in the barn loft. That should give us sightlines both sides of the property. T-Dog, you take the perimeter around the house. Keep track of everyone coming and going. What about standing guard? I need you and Daryl on double duty. Gotcha. I'll stock the basement with food and water, enough that we can all survive there a few days if need be. What about patrols? Let's get this area locked down first. After that, Shane'll assign shifts while me and Daryl take Randall offsite and cut him loose. We're back to that now? It was the right plan first time around. Poor execution. That's a slight understatement you don't agree, but this what's happening. Swallow it-- Move on. You know that Dale's death and the prisoner-- that's two separate things, right? You wanna take Daryl as your wingman, be my guest. Thank you. You got it. I see why you're not taking Shane with you. Just know I've got no more patience where he's concerned. He's turning over a new leaf. Andrea. When I'm out with Daryl, help Hershel keep an eye on things around here. Me Shane's got a way of letting things get out of hand, especially when he's all torqued up. I think we're all a bit torqued up at this point. If you're staying here permanently, he's got to understand that it's what Rick and I say, not whatever he wants. You've become close. We talk. Then you know he's not a bad guy. He's just his own worst enemy. You want me to babysit Shane? I need to make sure every time I leave the farm all hell doesn't break loose. Then maybe you should stop leaving. Will you keep an eye on things? Of course. Hey, Shane? What's up, man? What you doing, wandering around by yourself? If, um-- If I tell you something, will you promise not to tell my parents? I think it's probably a bad idea for both of us, bud. Hey, Carl. Come on back. Go on. I took it from Daryl's motorcycle. If he found out I took it, he'd kill me. What you doing with this? Dale. It's my fault that he died. Carl, why would you say that, man? He got bit by a walker. Why you say-- I saw that walker. I was gonna shoot it. When he was stuck in the mud. I was-- I was throwing rocks at him and stuff. But I was gonna do it-- shoot it right in the head. And it-- it got free, came after me and... I ran away. If I had killed it, Dale would still be here. Carl, I want you to stop that, okay? This ain't your fault. But you need to hold onto this. You need to protect yourself. As long as I'm around you, nothing's gonna happen to you, Carl. But I can't keep my eyes on you 24/7. Only you can do that. Carl, take it. - I'm never touching another gun again. That ain't no option, Carl, okay? Just give it back to Daryl. The men are in there. You can put your stuff upstairs in my room. With your dad in the house? I just-- I'm just gonna put my stuff over there. Whoa. Don't-- don't-- Don't strain yourself. Thank you. Rick and Carl and I are taking the corner of the living room. You can put that in my room. You'll be more comfortable there. We can't do that. - A pregnant woman and child sleeping on the floor while I've got a bed to myself? This is still your house. It's our home. I'll take the couch downstairs. On nights when I came home reeking of bourbon, my wife would lock the bedroom door. I'm sad to say that couch and I become old friends. Look, if you two can't decide, I'll take it. Thank you. The couch is mine. It's gonna get real cozy real fast in here. Wouldn't that be easier if you waited for some help? Ain't no use waiting for something that ain't gonna come. No, I'll just-- Just do it all myself. Yeah, you always do, just like that time you showed up Rick fixing our sink. Yeah. Just so you know, that's not the reason your basement flooded. You can thank Rick for that-- Using rubber washers with a metal pipe. Please come down. So after Sophia, I, uh... I thought "We'll figure this out." You know, we'll heal somehow. After Dale? This is real. And we can't... Keep it at bay. It's already got us. And it just keeps coming, doesn't it? I made a mess of things. I put you and Rick at odds. I don't even know whose baby this is. I can't imagine how hard that is on you. You led us out of Atlanta with no thought for yourself. Do you remember that night? The flames, the-- And I'm sitting in our car thinking "We're gonna be all right. He's gonna make it all right. We'll get out of here." And I never thanked you for that. Even though things got... Confused between us, you were there for me. You were there for me. Thank you. You don't need to thank me for that. Of course I do. Of course I do. No, you-- Whatever happened between us, whatever the hell we thought it was-- And not just you, but-- I'm sorry, Shane. Please believe me. I am  so  sorry. Take him out to Senoia-- hour there, hour back, give or take. We may lose the light, but we'll be halfway ho by then. This little pain in the ass will be a distant memory. Good riddance. Carol's putting together some provisions for him, enough to last a few days. That thing you did last night-- Ain't no reason you should do all the heavy lifting. So are you good with all this? I don't see you and I trading haymakers on the side of the road. Nobody'd win that fight. I'm gonna take a piss. Hey, man, you seen Carl lately? He's inside with his mother. Look, he came to me. Okay, I wasn't supposed to say anything, but he was out in the swamps yesterday and he came across a walker stuck in the mud. He got scared, ran off. The same walker that killed Dale? That's the one. I'll have Lori talk to him. Look, man, I think-- I think he wants to talk to his father. Well, I need this Randall thing done already. Man, that needs to wait, okay? It's my call. How about I ride out with Daryl? Good for us to spend a little time together. Nah, I need you here. Don't think I'll handle it right, huh? Didn't say that. What you say? You know, your son-- He gave me this. You should get that back to Daryl, huh? Freeing that prisoner... More important to you than Carl. Andrea. Hey, did you try pumping the gas pedal? I think it's been parked too long. You gotta tap it three times... And give her a twist. I know, know. Let me see. Uh, Dale told me that in these old vehicles the points get corroded. Screwdriver? Flathead. Okay. Could you hand me a file? I let him down. He was proud of you. Maybe not in that moment, but overall. Oh, that's easy for you to say. You had his back. I have my share of regrets, but I think that he knew how much we cared for him. That might do it. Glenn. Bet it'll work. 
 
 Mom said you'd be here. Told her I would stand lookout. I got tired of helping around the house. Take it. What happened to Dale had nothing to do with you. He-- he died, dad. Yeah. Yeah. Feels like there's a lot of that going around. That's why I need you. No more kid stuff. I wish you could have the childhood I had, but that's not gonna happen. People are gonna die. I'm gonna die. Mom. There's no way you can ever be ready for it. I try to be, but I can't. The best we can do now is avoid it as long as we can, keep one step ahead. I wish I had something better to say, something-- Something more profound. My father was good like that. But I'm tired, son. Please take it. Only got so many arrows. Is that Dale's gun? Yeah. Wish I knew where the hell mine is. Ready? Yeah. I'll get the package. Thanks. Yo, Randy. Governor called. You're off the hook. Oh, hell no. Shh! Go that way. Go on, go on. Shh-shh-shh-shh. Hey-hey, come on. Come on. I get it. I'm the last face you probably want to see, huh? Listen, I'm gonna take you up out of here, okay? I'm gonna get this off of you so you can breathe, but I want you to keep quiet. You listen good. Do you hear me? Okay. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Don't do nothing stupid. Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Hey-hey, keep it quiet now your group-- you know where they're at? No, I don't. I really-- oh! Okay. Get your little ass up here. Now I'm the only shot of you getting out of these woods alive. You hear me? Now you start talking, boy. Where are they at? We had a camp set up off the highway... Okay. ...About five miles from here. Shh-- Okay. Who knows if they're still there? Okay. So you gonna take me to 'em? Why? Because, man, I-- I'm just-- I'm done with this group, man. They doomed and I want no part of it. That's all. So you're not gonna kill me? Come on, man. If I was, you'd be dead. Come on. Hey, you ain't gotta be so rough. We're on the same side now. You're gonna like it with us. Gets a little crazy sometimes, but it's a tough bunch of guys. You'll fit in good. Less talking, more walking. Look, I run my mouth when I get nervous. I can't help it. I got a lot going on, you know? It ain't all about you. I-- I ain't saying it's about me. Just trying to-- What's wrong? Randall's missing. Missing? How. How long's he been gone? - What's goin' on? - It's hard to say. The cuffs are still hooked. He must' slipped 'em. Is that possible? It is if you've got nothing to lose. The door was secured from the outside. Rick! Rick! What happened? He's armed! He's got my gun! Are you okay? I'm fine. Little b*st*rd just snuck up on me. He clocked me in the face. All right, Hershel, T-Dog, get everybody back in the house. Glenn, Daryl, come with us. T, I'm gonna need that gun. - Just let him go. That was the plan, wasn't it, to just let him go? The plan was to cut him loose far away from here, not on our front step with a gun. Don't go out there. Ya'll know what can happen. Get everybody back in the house. Lock all the doors and stay put! Let's go, back in the house. Okay. I saw him head up through the trees that way before I blacked out. I'm not sure how long. He couldn't have gotten far. He's hobbled, exhausted. And armed. So are we. Can you track him? No, I don't see nothing. Hey, look, there ain't no use in tracking him, okay? He went that way. We need to pair up. We spread out, we just chase him down. That's it. Kid weighs a buck-25 soaking wet. You trying to tell us he got the jump on you? I say a rock pretty much evens those odds, wouldn't you? Alright, knock it off. You and Glenn start heading up the right flank. Me and Shane'll take the left. Remember, Randall's not the only threat out there. Keep an eye out for each other. Looks like it's busted pretty bad. It's fine, man. Don't worry about me. This is pointless. You got a light? Come on. We're just back to square one. If you're gonna do a thing, you might as well do it right. There's two sets of tracks right here. Shane must've followed him a lot longer than he said. There's fresh blood on this tree. There's more tracks. Looks like they're walking in tandem. Sorry. Yeah, there was a little dust up right here. - What do you mean? - I mean something went down. It's getting weird. Had a little trouble. Oh. Nice. Does this way feel right? As right as any. Snatched your gun, huh? Yeah. It's my favorite piece too. Gonna wish he'd-- Wish he'd killed me when I find his sorry ass. Go on. He's got no bites. Yeah, none you can see. No, I'm telling you he died from this. How's that possible? You say he got you with a rock? That's what I said. Inside the shed? 'Cause that door was shut when T-Dog rolled up. I saw that too. Must've slipped through the rafters in the roof. So this is where you planned to do it? It's a good place as any. At least have the balls to call this what it is-- Murder. You really believe if you walk back onto that farm alone-- No me, no Randall-- I want you to hush up. You really believe they're gonna buy whatever bullshit story you cook up? That's just it. It ain't no story. I saw that prisoner shoot you down. I ran after him. I snapped his neck. It ain't gonna be easy, but Lori and Carl-- They'll get over you. They done it before. They just gonna have to. Why? Why now? I thought we worked this all out. We tried to kill each other man. What you think? We just gonna forget about it all? We gonna ride off into the sunset together? You're gonna kill me in cold blood? Screw my wife? Have my children-- my children-- call you daddy? Is that what you want? That life won't be worth a damn. I know you. You won't be able to live with this. What you know about what I can live with? You got no idea what I can live with, what I live with! You wanna talk about what I can do, Rick? How about what you can do? Here I am. Come on, man. Raise your gun. No. No, I will not. What happened, Rick? I thought you weren't the good guy anymore. Ain't that what you said? Even right here, right now, you ain't gonna fight for 'em? I'm a better father than you, Rick. I'm better for Lori than you, man. It's 'cause I'm a better man than you, Rick. 'Cause I can be here and I'll fight for it. You come back here and you just destroy everything! You got a broken woman. You got a weak boy. You ain't got the first clue on how to fix it. Raise your gun. You're gonna have to kill an unarmed man. Watch my hand. Nice and easy. Easy does it. Now listen to me, Shane. There is still a way back from this. Nothing has happened here. We're gonna lay down our guns and we're gonna walk back to the farm... Together. Back to Lori. Back to Carl. Put this all behind us. Shh. Damn you for making me do this, Shane. This was you, not me! You did this to us! This was you, not me-- not me! Not me! Son of... Dad? Carl. You know... You should be back home with mom. Just-- just put the-- Put the gun down. It's not what it seems. Please. Wait-wait-wait-wait.
