 Previously on AMC's 
 The Walking Dead... 
 What about T, Carol? 
 They didn't make it. 
 This is sick! 
 Everyone's having a great time. 
 It's barbaric. 
 You don't have to do this all by yourself. 
 And I know my brother... if he's out there, I'll be able to find him. 
 Are you coming or not? 
 What the hell is this mess? 
 She did this. 
 It means something, the way it's all set up like that. 
 The Governor was right to send us out. 
 Damn straight, Tim. 
 We're doing all right, just public service here. 
 Go back. 
 What? 
 The arms are a G. The legs make an O. 
 And that's a back. 
 It says, "Go back." 
 This is too good. 
 Look at this. 
 She sent us a biter-gram, y'all. 
 I don't believe this is happening. 
 Hey, hey! You knock it off. 
 What the hell's wrong with you? 
 Now, the Governor chose you 
 'cause he thought you were ready. 
 I want you to succeed. I do. 
 But if you keep announcing to the world that you're pissing your pants, I'm gonna have to smash your teeth in. 
 Now how do you say your last name? 
 Gargulio. 
 Well, I'm gonna keep calling you Neil. All right? 
 What's the deal, Michonne? Hmm? 
 You gonna leap out of the woods, one against four, all of us armed to the teeth 
 and you with just 
 your little pig-sticker? 
 No, no, no, Michonne. 
 We having fun yet?! 
 Hello? 
 Is-- is someone there? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Who is--? 
 Oh, my God! 
 I can't believe someone picked up. 
 We've been calling since-- 
 since it all started. 
 Where are you? 
 I can't say. 
 You could be 1,000 miles away. 
 I'm not going to say where we are. 
 Are you-- 
 are you someplace safe? 
 Yeah. 
 And part of it 
 is because we're careful. 
 I can't tell you where we are. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What ma-- what makes your place so safe? 
 It's just... 
 away... 
 from them. 
 I have a son. 
 I-- I have a newborn baby. 
 I'm with a good group of people. 
 Would you be willing-- 
 could you take in others? 
 We can pull our weight. We can help you. 
 I'd have to talk to the group. 
 Well, put them on. Let me make a case. 
 Let me talk to them first. 
 Please, please, don't-- don't go. 
 Just-- please, we're good people here. 
 We just need some help and... we can help, we-- 
 I'll call you in two hours. 
 Please! 
 You don't understand. 
 You don't know. 
 We're dying. 
 We're dying here. 
 Everybody okay? 
 Yeah, we are. 
 What about you? 
 I cleared out the boiler block. 
 How many were there? 
 I don't know. A dozen, two dozen. 
 I have to get back. Just wanted to check on Carl. 
 Rick, we can handle taking out the bodies. 
 You don't have to. 
 - No, I do. 
 Everyone have a gun and a knife? 
 Yeah. We're running low on ammo, though. 
 Maggie and me were planning on making a run this afternoon. 
 Found a phone book with some places we can hit, look for bullets and formula. 
 We cleared out the generator room. 
 Axel's there trying to fix it in case of emergency. 
 We're gonna sweep the lower levels as well. 
 Good, good. 
 Rick. 
 Let's go. She's hit. 
 Slowed her down. 
 Tim and Crowley, they-- 
 We're close to the red zone. 
 Them shots just pulled every biter in this area our way. 
 Let's go. Get up. 
 Neil! 
 Now you're gonna rise to the occasion, son. 
 Some serious sh1t's going down. 
 I need you here. You read me, amigo? 
 I don't want you to die. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Get up. Now you know, we don't ever let our own turn. 
 Never. 
 Come on. 
 Just do it. 
 Atta boy. 
 Come on, let's get going. 
 She ain't running, she's hunting. 
 So are we. There we go. 
 My mother said to pick... 
 My mother said to pick... 
 You know you can join in. 
 They don't bite. 
 That's kind of the whole idea of the place. 
 Seems like you also encourage people to punch each other in the face. 
 The arena. 
 You didn't like that much, huh? 
 No, not so much, but I get it. 
 Listen, I want to ask you something. 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Hold on. How do you get it? 
 I'm not gonna tell you how to run your town. 
 This is our town. You stayed. 
 You're part of this now, so tell me. 
 If it's an escape, I don't think it's the right one. 
 It's brutality for fun and I think the world's brutal enough already. 
 It really bothered you, huh? 
 But I do want to be here. 
 So what were you saying before I made you condemn our sadistic way of life? 
 I want to contribute. Everyone else does. 
 Well, Robbie could use some help in food distr-- - I want to work the wall. 
 I'm a good shot. I want to stay that way. 
 Can you use a bow? 
 I can learn. 
 Well, I can get somebody to teach you. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 You the guy she was talking to? 
 Yes. 
 And you want to come where we are? 
 She said it was safe. 
 It is. 
 No attacks, no one's been bit, 
 no one's died, 
 no one's turned, no one's gone crazy. 
 Yes, we want to come where you are. 
 You could be dangerous. 
 Have you killed anyone? 
 Yes, people who threatened me or threatened my group. 
 How many people have you killed? 
 Four. 
 Two outsiders who tried to draw on me. 
 One threw me to walkers. 
 The other one, he was one of our own. 
 He lost it. 
 Lost what? 
 Who he was. 
 He threatened me. 
 He tried to kill me, so I killed him. 
 How did you lose your wife? 
 How do you know I had a wife? 
 You have a boy and a baby. 
 Tell me how you lost your wife. 
 I don't want to talk about that. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? No! 
 Thanks for doing this. 
 When the Gov asks me to do something, I do it. 
 I figure we can start tomorrow. 
 There's a training area, some hay bales. 
 There's even a bow you can use. 
 It was my old one. 
 You must be pretty good. 
 Yeah. My dad taught me. 
 He used to take me hunting. 
 He wanted me to be in the Olympics. 
 This one was his. 
 I mean, it's worth more than my car. 
 It's... awesome. 
 So I totally killed him for it. 
 That wasn't why you killed him. 
 No. 
 My dad wasn't himself and my brother wasn't either. 
 I had to kill my sister. 
 It sucks, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Walker. 
 Cool. Watch this. 
 I got it. 
 I can do it. 
 We're not supposed to go over the wall. 
 What the hell was that? 
 That is how it's done. 
 I said I could do it. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 This isn't a game. 
 May I? 
 Still feel it. 
 I'm wiggling my toes right now. 
 I'm a ghost from the knee down. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You saved my life, Rick. 
 She was sorry for the things that happened. 
 She told me that. 
 She planned on telling you. 
 Take your time, whatever you need. 
 You carried us. 
 You didn't let us give up. You got us here. 
 It's not enough. It's not safe enough. 
 There isn't anywhere else. 
 I know you want to get away from this, but we've run already. 
 I got a call. 
 What? 
 Someone called. 
 On this phone. 
 A woman. 
 She was young. She was part of a group. 
 She said they had a safe place. 
 They said they were just dialing numbers and I picked up. 
 She said they'd be calling back. 
 If it sounds right, I want to talk them into taking us in. 
 Did she say where they were? 
 No, but it doesn't matter. 
 If it's safe, we'll get there. 
 Don't tell the rest of the group, not yet. 
 I'll sit here with you. 
 That's something 
 I'm pretty good at nowadays. 
 No. 
 All right. 
 Move! 
 Ah! 
 Check it out, man. 
 Must have missed it last night. 
 It's probably just one or two of 'em. 
 Don't look they got much fight. 
 They ain't going nowhere. 
 We'll take care of it on the way back. 
 Come on. 
 You know, my mom, she liked her wine. 
 She liked to smoke in bed. 
 Virginia Slims. 
 I was playing out with the kids in the neighborhood. 
 I could do that with Merle gone. 
 They had bikes, I didn't. 
 We heard sirens getting louder. 
 They jumped on their bikes, ran after it, you know, hoping to see something worth seeing. 
 I ran after them, but I couldn't keep up. 
 I ran around a corner and saw my friends looking at me. 
 Hell, I saw everybody looking at me. 
 Fire trucks everywhere. 
 People from the neighborhood. 
 It was my house they were there for. 
 It was my mom in bed burnt down to nothing. 
 That was the hard part. 
 You know, she was just gone. Erased. Nothing left of her. 
 People said it was better that way. 
 I don't know. 
 Just made it seem like it wasn't real, you know? 
 I shot my mom. 
 She was out. 
 Hadn't turned yet. 
 I ended it. 
 It was real. 
 Sorry about your mom. 
 I'm sorry about yours. 
 Come on. 
 
 
 
 Come in. 
 I know why you want to see me. 
 You were told we don't go over unless we have to. 
 I just... 
 I wanted a little practice. 
 Fair enough. 
 We don't need you on the wall. 
 Okay. 
 I liked the fights. 
 I didn't like that I liked them. 
 But you did. I know. 
 What? 
 How? 
 Could have walked out. You started walking out. 
 But you stayed. 
 Just like you stayed right enough to tell me that. 
 Are you saying that I like you, too? 
 I think I'm growing on you. 
 You rose to the occasion, kid. 
 When we get back, I'm gonna get you a beer. 
 Come on, she can't have made it that far. 
 No, no, no, no. We're done. 
 We're gonna grab a car, haul ass home. 
 It's been a good day's work. 
 But she-- she killed 
 Tim and Crowley. 
 Yep, but we messed her up pretty bad. 
 Anyway, she's headed straight for the red zone. 
 She's as good as dead. 
 What do we tell the governor? 
 What the hell you think we tell him? 
 Tell him we killed her. 
 Like I said, man, she's as good as dead. 
 I'm gonna keep going. 
 She ain't right in the head. 
 She gonna die. 
 Ain't worth our time. 
 Definitely ain't worth our blood. 
 Now let's go. 
 This is some serious sh1t. That's what you said. 
 I'm not gonna lie to the Governor about it. 
 You're right. 
 Can't cut corners on this one. 
 You've come along pretty quick there, kid. 
 How do you say your name again? 
 Gargulio. 
 Gargulio. 
 Hear that bird? 
 Gargulio. 
 Hello? 
 You didn't want to tell him  how your wife died? 
 No, I just lost her, but... 
 But if that's what it takes... 
 It'd be good. 
 You should talk about it, Rick. 
 That sounds-- 
 How-- 
 how do you know my name? 
 Clear outside. 
 All right, let's take a look. 
 Hey. 
 It's a beautiful day. 
 Glenn, get that duck. 
 What? 
 - Get that duck. 
 Are you serious? 
 - Yeah. 
 A kid growing up in a prison 
 could use some toys. 
 You were the kind of guy who waxed his car every weekend, right? 
 No, I wasn't particularly proud of my car or my house or my job. 
 My dog was a wonder of stupidity. 
 Lost a fight with a tree once. 
 You did this. 
 I find it hard to believe that you didn't have a single thing that you were proud of before. 
 I didn't say that. 
 I had something. 
 So how long has it been? 
 Uh, since-- 
 since you had whiskey this good? 
 So long I can't remember. 
 Well, I'm happy to forget a lot. 
 Not just the bad stuff. 
 Even the good times? 
 I want to be here right now. 
 This glass in my hand, leaves in the breeze, talking to you. 
 I feel special. 
 An audience with the governor. 
 Ugh. 
 Let's just go with Philip, huh? I'm off the clock. 
 Oh, Philip. That's better. 
 Makes me feel less like a lobbyist. 
 You don't have to be ashamed about liking the fight. 
 Or fighting the fight. 
 I love it. 
 It's not the only thing, but nowadays, it's part of being alive. 
 Really alive. 
 Most people don't have it, what it takes to see the whole story. 
 Being able to live with it, to use it. 
 That's why there's a hell of a lot more of them than us. 
 Us. 
 Yeah. 
 'Cause you have it, Andrea. 
 You made it. 
 So enjoy it. 
 Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. 
 Oh, I'm not planning on dying. 
 No, neither am I. It just happens. 
 Other things happen. 
 We just hit the powdered formula jackpot. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 I also got beans, batteries,  cocktail wieners, many mustards. 
 It's a straight shot back 
 to the prison from here. 
 Probably make it in time for dinner. 
 I like the quiet. 
 Back there, back home, you can always hear them outside the fence no matter where you are. 
 And where is it y'all good people are calling home? 
 Merle? 
 Wow! 
 Hey, back the hell up! 
 Okay, okay, honey. 
 Jesus. 
 You made it. 
 Can you tell me, is my brother alive? 
 Huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, you take me to him and I'll call it even on everything that happened up there in Atlanta. 
 No hard feelings. Huh? 
 You like that? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I found myself a medical supply warehouse. 
 Fixed it up myself. 
 Well, pretty cool, huh? 
 We'll tell Daryl you're here and he'll come out to meet you. 
 Hold on. Just hold up. 
 Whoa. Whoa. 
 Hold up here. Hold up. 
 Hey, the fact that we found each other is a miracle. 
 Come on, now. 
 You can trust me. 
 You trust us. 
 You stay here. 
 No! 
 Hey, hey, hold up, buddy, hold up. 
 Let go of her. Let go of her! 
 Put it in the car, son. 
 There you go. Now we're gonna go for a little drive. 
 We're not going back to our camp. 
 No, we're going somewhere else. 
 Get in the car, Glenn! You're driving! 
 Move! 
 Don't. 
 Okay. 
 Get up. 
 That's it. 
 Oh, that's what I'm talking about. 
 Yeah, buddy. 
 What the hell you need slippers for? 
 You know, end of the day, relaxing. 
 All right. 
 Must have been in the cell at the end. 
 We checked everywhere else. 
 That's Carol's knife. 
 How did you know my name? 
 Because we know you. 
 How do you know me? 
 That's Carol's knife. 
 The people you were talking to today, 
 that was Amy, Jim, Jacqui. 
 Lori? 
 Lori? 
 Lori? Lori? 
 What happened, Rick? 
 Baby, what happened? 
 I loved you. 
 I loved you. 
 I couldn't put it back together. 
 I couldn't put it back together. 
 I thought it was... 
 I made a deal with myself. 
 I would keep you alive. 
 I'd find a place. I would fix that. 
 And then... 
 I couldn't open that door. I couldn't risk it. 
 I was gonna keep you alive. 
 Carl, the baby. And then... 
 I thought there'd be time. 
 There's never time. 
 But I loved you. 
 I love you. 
 I couldn't put it back together. 
 I should have said it. 
 I should-- I should have said it. 
 Rick. 
 Now you listen to me. 
 You have a baby. 
 Our baby. 
 And Carl. 
 And the others. 
 I love you. 
 Rick. 
 Can you do that? 
 Can you do that? 
 Rick? Rick? 
 Rick? 
 Rick? Rick? 
 I lied when I said 
 I was off the clock. 
 This is a 24/7 kind of gig. 
 Should I hide under the bed? 
 Not this time. 
 Company? 
 Yeah. 
 We lost all three guys. 
 Tim, Crowley, the other one. 
 Gargulio. 
 Jesus. 
 Yeah, she cut Tim down, put her sword through him. 
 Then biters got in the middle of it, then I got her. 
 Damn. 
 Well, we'll dress it up. Give 'em a hero's funeral. 
 You tell a story. A supply run gone sideways. 
 Do you have 'em? 
 Her head. The sword. 
 Um, we got caught in a crowd. 
 The kid had the head, Crowley had the sword. 
 They both got all tore up. 
 I got something else for you, though. 
 A guy I used to know from the Atlanta camp and his pretty little girlfriend. 
 They know Andrea? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Anyone else? 
 Don't know. 
 Found them on the return trip. 
 From the looks of 'em, they got to be set up pretty good. 
 I'll find out where. 
 Everything okay? 
 Hell, yeah. 
 Hey. 
 She looks like you. 
 Hey, just-- 
 you got her? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Okay.
