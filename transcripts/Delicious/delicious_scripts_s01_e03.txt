 I think it's creepy. 
 Just... Everyone's just staring down at a dead person. 
 Dad! 
 He chose you. He wanted you. 
 I know. 
 I need an abortion. 
 Solicitor :  It seemed that as a tax avoidance strategy, the Penrose hotel had been placed  in Miss Benelli's name. 
 He is your brother! 
 He is my half brother. 
 sh1t! 
 New Order : "Ceremony" 
 Leo :  You never forget where you got married. 
 Which means there are hundreds of people who will never ever forget the Penrose. 
 It brought them together for one special day, and made them truly happy. 
 I was one of those people myself. 
 I felt utterly, hopelessly in love. 
 But it wasn't for the first time. 
 I could never forget Gina. 
 We built this place together. 
 And in a way, she'd never left. All this time, and I owned it. [SHE LAUGHS] Mmh? It's mine! Again. Well, it's ours. Amazing. Is that that Will chap? The one with the appetite. So none of your business. Mm-mmh. Welcome home, Miss Benelli. Thank you. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Gina : Aah! Leo brought me here, first, at  this  exact spot. Pointed at that view. And then he told me that we owned it. Without even discussing it? Yeah. Well he knew that I'd love it. How wonderful. Mmh. You do realise Dr King's wedding is still booked for this weekend? If there's any change of plan in the circumstance, we... No, I intend to honour all of the bookings. I ran this place before and I'll run it again. My way. You are the boss. Man : Four double bedrooms... bijoux home office... commanding views up the river. Large designer kitchen! Fully equipped, suits keen amateur. Cook... Either you bugger off now, or that little phone will be recording the fascinating sounds of your own back passage. [WHISPERING] Sorry. They can't do this. This is our home. It's bullshit! You're right, it's ludicrous. I mean, to leave us like this, and then give our only asset  to her ?! I don't see that we have any alternative. Well, whatever the situation, we mustn't give up. I mean this isn't a war, dear, not see bombs on falling! In situations like this a little bloody mindedness goes a long way. Where are you going? The hotel. Official handover. Oh, should I come with you? No. I'll do it. ♪Upstairs to my room. Thank you. Are we seriously living in an attic, now? Sort of Miss Havisham meets the Addams family? Oh, come on. Let me show it all to you properly. Or, you could've actually asked me first if I wanted to move into Hogwarts. Look. The house... the old house... was Leo's. I paid him rent. Sometimes. So he paid for it all that time? You are unbelievable. Well he owed me. [PHONE VIBRATES] No, he owned you. There's a difference. I think that's a bit unfair. I have to go. Teresa. Teresa! I'm sorry, Miss Benelli, Mrs Vincent is here. ...Right. Bookings. Legal paperwork, it should all be in here. [CLINKING] My own... keys. I'm so sorry. All of this can't be easy. I still can't believe he did this to you. No one seems to be able to look me in the eye. It's... like he's died all over again. Let me put the kettle on? Have you had some breakfast? No. Thanks, um... I assume that Suzy's reminded you about Rosa's wedding? Yeah, we're ready. She's very efficient. [PHONE RINGS IN THE BACKGROUND] That's why he hired her. I think. ♪ They can still see us, you know. Drones. Theses days, the CIA can spot incest in 40 000 feet. Yeah, but are you really sure that it's, you know... That. Yeah, I googled it. Definitely illegal. Unless when they live in France, Belgium, or the Netherlands. Basically you can f*ck your sister all through the Benelux countries. Okay I'm... being serious. We... Kissed each other. You kissed me! [LAUGHTER] Okay, can we just pretend nothing happened? Hey, nobody knows, nobody saw us. There are no "incest drones". Could we just... walk away? If that's what you want. Everybody knows I'm f*cked up. [LAUGHTER] This would just be the icing on the cake. The girl killed by rain does incest. "Kill Kyle" Mm. D'you remember that day when we went camping with Dad? You were like... what, five? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got home and all I wanted to do was tell Mum everything that we've done. And then I overheard them talking. I remember his exact words. "There. I did it. I took her. Happy now?! [SHE SIGHS] So that was the end of my perfect day. ♪ [GUITAR] Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss. Nothing has to mean anything. So we just... forget about it, okay? Yea. And... I mean if, if that's what you want. That's what I want. Where are you going? Home, apparently. Mimi : Oh, there you are. Um, this is Detective Inspector Hicks. Leo :  If you think my mother wouldn't spit in a police officer's tea, then you don't know my mother. [SIPPING NOISE] Lovely, thank you. You understand my problem, Mrs Vincent. Leo was a chef! Yes, he ran the business, but his heart was always in the kitchen! That's why I'm sure all this was a mistake. I disagree. A fraud this extensive takes planning. Malice and forethought. I did a little digging. Into your own background. [TAKES BREATH] Four A-levels, an MBA, several years, working at an executive level in retail, and, then you came to the Penrose Hotel as a manager. After which a, um... change in focus. Your point is? That far from being the trophy wife of a deluded, middle-aged man, you're an intelligent and capable woman who's her husband's equal in every way. Most people... think they can hide the money they steal. Their mistake is that they assume they are cleverer than I am. They underestimate me. I always find it. Thank you so much for the tea. Oh, you're very welcome. Nico : "These Days" ♪ I've been out walking ♪ 
♪ I don't do too much talking these days ♪ Leo :  A truly successful hotel needs atmosphere. Something you can feel but never touch. It was my name on the license. But it was really always hers. Gina's spirit embraced the place. ♪ And all the times I had... ♪ ♪ ...the chance to ♪ Leo :  Yes. We grew it all here. ♪ I've stopped my dreaming ♪ 
♪ I won't do tooo much scheming these days ♪ 
♪ These days ♪ 
♪ These days I sit on corner stones ♪ 
♪ And count the time in quarter tones to ten ♪ 
♪ Please don't confront me with my failures, ♪ 
♪ I had not forgotten them. ♪ [MUSIC STOPS] [SHE EXHALES] So was it really...  that  perfect, or is this just... more middle age and nostalgic bullshit? No, it's true. For one summer I had... everything I ever wanted. He loved you. Mm-mmh. We loved each other. [SIGHS] So... now... Do you... love... this Will? Well, I need to know about that. I  demand  to know about that. [GRUNTS] Honestly? Mmh. It's too early to say. Liar! [LAUGHTER] I don't love anyone! Not like that. You will. When you meet them. So when did you know? That dad was the only one for you? Mmh. Honestly? [CLICKS TONGUE] It's too early to say. I'm hungry. You heard her. I had a life. I had a career. I just gave it all up. Well, for good reason. For Michael. Or was that just my excuse? Don't try, don't fail. Aah, for goodness' sake. Self-examination is like masturbation. If done at all, best kept private. [DISTANT BEEPING NOISE] What was that? [INDISTINCT YELLING OUTSIDE] Michael : Think you could, don't think you can do it! Ey, you just get down. You look like an idiot up there. Michael : Are you happy? You're a cockroach and a parasite! This is my car! What you think you're surfing? Get down, you prat! And I'll never give it up. *** Oh, does it? Well, jog on, mate. [LAUGHTER] Do you know... When you were little, you used to tell me everything. You never stopped talking. Mh, shame I had nothing to say. So talk to me now! I've lost him. I don't wanna lose you, too. That night, when dad died, I um... I wasn't there. You were sick? Because... I'd taken a pill. I had an abortion. How dare you! Ow, ow, ow, excuse me. My daughter comes to you for advice, and you help her do this! Gina, this is my home, can you... She's clearly vulnerable. She's still practically a child! No! Actually, she is an adult, and as such, she has a perfect right to decide what happens to her own body. I'm her mother! Yes, she precisely chooses not to involve you in her life. Have you ever wondered why? I mean that perhaps she senses that she can't really trust you, because I know that I don't. You waited years to wreck Sam's marriage. That is unfair! You can fool the others who can't see further that their own noses but you do not fool me. So I would like you to leave. Is everything okay? [EXHALING]: Yeah. Fine, under control, Gina was just leaving. D'you know, Leo left  me  the Penrose. It's mine. Which means I can do what I want with it. And I don't want  you , or your wedding. Will you just give me some time... No. He needs to get down. No. We're takin' it. Well, sorry, you can't. Michael! No. Someone needs to make a stand here. Alright? They're not taking it! So, you come to tell him to get out? You know, he's eighteen, we can't control him. I mean, look, he's like a wild beast. [SIGHS] Fine. I got blood pressure, I'm not doing this all way.

It seems she's unhappy with the way that I was treating her daughter. So she... forced her way in, threatened me, and... when I asked her to leave she turned around and told me the wedding was off! Just like that? But you've had it planned for months, she can't do this. Well, frankly, I wouldn't have her involved even if she beg me. To be honest, I feel sorry for that poor girl. This is not your problem. I'm sorry, you're upset. I-I can see I shouldn't have told you, you've got enough on your plate right now. No, no, no, no, this is Gina's spite, pure and simple. And I'm not gonna let her get away with it. Cancelled?! Why? 'Coz I don't want her money, and I don't want her business. Then we have a real problem. ♪Why, it's only one booking? To tell the truth, we need to return this place to what made it  really  work, which is good, honest food. at affordable prices and not for some jumped-up GPS. This needs to be a place that  real  people want to come to. [WHISPERS] Gina! Can I be completely honest? Mm-mmh. I've been looking at the books. The accounts were never actually balanced, as such. We're loosing money! Thousands. The Penrose was Leo's flagship. That's why it *** with the rest of the business but it's never paid its way. And that wedding was our life line! Without it we can't pay our bills! Any of them. [SIGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Dad? Dad?! Help. Help! Help! Help! Come on. Help! Help! [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] [MUMBLES]: Thirty... Forty. You are unbelievable! Do you have any idea how long Rosa's planned this for?! I know. Months of work! And you just turn around and cancel it! Why? Well, we had a difference of opinion. What kind of a person does that? To just ruin a woman's entire wedding out of pure malice! It wasn't that simple. She told you what happened? You know what, I'm not interested. Clearly you couldn't resist another opportunity to f*ck up someone else's life! I think you actually enjoy it, don't you? Causing chaos and misery wherever you go? Because it's all about number one! It's just the way you... I'm sorry. You're right. What? I said I'm sorry. You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Yes. Just that... Where Teresa's concerned, I get a little bit... You know I just... I-I lost it. It was unfair, and I overreacted. Of course, she should have her wedding here! You mean it? You're prepared to have it back? Yeah. I want you to talk to her. Please, just explain that I'm really sorry, it was just... heat of the moment stuff, you know, totally stupid. Alright. I'll do my best. Sam : Thanks. Right. Rosa : To be honest, I'm more concerned about you. and this whole business with the police. It's something that I... brought on myself. I-I don't understand. It doesn't matter. And I hate you are a bloody GP, dealing with everyone's problems, and I'm moaning in your ear all the time! Don't be ridiculous. No, I've  been  ridiculous. Which is why I want to organise the wedding for you. At the Penrose. Gina apologised. Admitted she was wrong. We both want to do this. I  want to do this. Okay. 
 
 Hiya. Hey. What can I get you? Er, coffee. Black, thanks. [DISHES CLINKING] Uh, I can't smoke in here, right? Not unless it's 1983 and no one's told me. I'll be outside, then. [COFFEE MACHINE WHIRRING] I spoke to Rosa and she has agreed to have it back at the Penrose That's fantastic. Certainly timely. And Rosa's agreed that I should supervise the entire day. Obviously we don't have much time, so... We'll need to get cracking. Mmh. Of course that means you'll be working directly for me. But I... And in the circumstances I'm arranging for the entire day to be catered by a bespoke firm. You don't think I can do this? I just think that Rosa deserves the very best. Don't you? [CAR BEEPS] [DOOR SHUTS, ENGINE STARTS] [GUITAR INTRO] I thought we weren't cooking for the wedding. When I'm happy, I cook. When I'm unhappy I cook. When I want to strangle someone with my bare hands... You're Italian. I understand. Ah. Spaghetti alla vongole. Mhhhhmmm. May I? Certo ! Mmh! Leo taught you this. No, my grandmother taught me! And I taught him. Didn't he tell you? He said he invented it while sitting in a café in Palermo. Something about being inspired by a blind violinist. Ah, typical Leo. Even his lies were stolen. He never cooked like this. Mmh! [RINGING TONE] Scusi . Hello! I don't know how you got my number. Don't call me again. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Look, I'm sorry. I was really angry. I'm  really  glad that you talked to me. No more secrets, okay? Okay. [KEYS JINGLE; DOOR CREAKS OPEN...] [... AND CLOSE] [LAUGHING] Yeah, that's absolutely correct. Thanks. You seem brighter, dear. All in hand? I think so. They'll deliver on the day. Seem very efficient. Good for you. What are you doing? I thought you loathed computers. I'm following the money. Oh! It really is quite Byzantine! But... Fascinating! If there's a way out of this mess, I'm gonna find it. Where's Michael? Oh, he's in his bedroom, with the door locked. I'm expecting the broadband to go down any minute. [MYSTERY MUSIC] [CLICKS] Leo :  Okay, I think we need this straightened out. I wasn't trying to commit suicide. No-one was meant to think that. I couldn't afford a divorce. Let's face it, none of us could. The business was... finely balanced. I knew the minute a lawyer got involved, the whole thing would come crashing down. I thought if she saw how the stress of losing her had affected me, she'd had a change of heart. I mean, I only took five. I just had a brilliant idea for a fresh scallop dish. I did not want to die. Obviously. [GRUNTS] [MUSIC INTENSIFYING] [CAR HORN BLOWS] Not my finest hour. Intellectually. And God knows I didn't want Michael to find me. Not like that. Dad. [HORN OF THE CAR] Dad? It seems some pills are more potent than others. Especially if your coronary arteries aren't as smooth as they used to be. [SIREN OUTSIDE] [SIRENS STOP] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GUITAR MUSIC] Hey, not bad. Rustic. But with a touch of class. by yours truly. Sam : If you just want to check in, then you can relax upstairs. Perfect. Leo :  Getting married... It's the closest most people come to be on a 24-hour cook binge. Boundless energy, high as a kite. Nothing but me, me, me. But believe me, the cocaine works out cheaper in the long run. Wow, it's amazing. How beautiful. Everyone's worked really hard on it. [PHONE MESSAGE NOTIFICATION] sh1t! It's work. Erm, excuse me. You okay? Me? Mmh. Today is your day. Everything's under control. So, relax. That's an order. Yes, ma'am. It's perfect. It's all so perfect. Thank you. I'm just so glad everything came together. [CALL INCOMING] I'm sorry. Hello? Yes. What do you mean, you're not coming? What circumstances? I can't hear you properly. Hang on. Wait. Say again? Yes, I know there have been issues with the business, but I can assure you all accounts will be settled at the end of the month. Hello? Hello? sh1t! [GUITAR MUSIC] [KITCHEN NOISES] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey. Hey! I need to talk to you. Seems all our suppliers are owed money. How long since he last paid them? Three months. [SIGHS] The b*st*rd must have known it was all over. [SIGHS] Christ! It's a good job that he's dead already or I'd kill him myself. She's my friend. This is my fault. My mess. I'll tell her. Wait, wait, wait. We could still do this. With what? There's no food, the wine merchant just cancelled. There's wine in the cellar. It's not what they're expecting, but we can serve it. How many covers? Sixty! Yeah, I can do that. But I'll need help. Lots of help. Teresa : Why didn't the doctor say anything? Michael : Because no one knew he'd take anything. The pills were under the seat. I mean, everybody just assumes that he had this heart attack but what... But what if he did... I mean, I just had an argument with him, and I was really... Really angry. What, so he killed himself? Because his teenage son went off the deep end? Mom was leaving and the business is gone. I-I could have just pushed him over the edge. Or he could have just had a heart attack and dropped his pills. Look... I just... I just want to know what to do. Nothing! We do nothing. Who is this gonna help? No one. ♪ But what if it's the truth? Well then, we bury it. Okay, you and me. It'll be our little secret. One we take to our graves, okay? Okay. I understand what you're saying but I'm sorry. It's gone too far. You will all be paid eventually. You have my word. Again... Absolutely no disrespect intended but... I don't really know in the circumstance what your word is really worth. Suzy, please don't do this. Not today. [FOOTSTEPS MOVING AWAY] [SIGHS] Aren't you going as well? Leo taught me all he could. But now I know there's more to learn. Even though I can't pay you. I lied for him. I didn't like it but I did it. So now I owe her. And you owe  me , okay? Okay. [CHUCKLES] Wait! Suzy! Please, will you reconsider? I just think you're making a mistake in walking away from an opportunity like this. Gina has no idea how to run this place, not as a real business. But  you  do! Walk away now and you're just... another part of Leo's failure! Stay and turn this place around and you can... properly write your own check. Three weeks ago, I hated your guts. [SIGHS] I thought you and Leo were sleeping with each other. I can assure you that I did not... I know. Thing is... I thought you were the new me. The younger model. Stay. Please! You know she needing this wedding. Without it the entire place would have folded. Maybe we both need a miracle. [♪ GEORGE EZRA: Blame It on Me ♪] Leo :  This was once a family business.

Champagne? Yes! [MUSIC STOPS] [BOTH LAUGH] Happy? Who wouldn't be? I have just married a very rich woman. [BOTH LAUGH] You dirty, little gold-digger, you! Don't worry, you can help me spend it. In fact... there's... there's lots of things that we could do together. I shocked you. I'm... I'm sorry. I thought... After everything he'd done to you. It's your wedding. [SIGHS] And I lie back and I think of England like a good girl. Don't you love her? Oh, gosh, she's... That is such a loaded word. It just works. For both of us. Practical. Like it did for you and Leo. No, that's not how it was. I loved Leo. [CHUCKLES] Just because you say it... doesn't make it true. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Snap. Would you like some? Mom's geriatrical weed. Ah. [EXHALES] You got changed. Can you blame me? God knows where she found those clothes. Well... You look really nice. [SHE CHUCKLES] What? You don't take me seriously at all, do you? Mmh. Don't take it personally. It's more of a genetic thing. I know this is wrong, but it doesn't... It doesn't feel wrong, does it? [THUNDER RUMBLING] Oh, sh1t! Hey... uh... this way. Come on. [RAIN DROPPING] [THUNDER CRASHING] You clever boy! She's married her for the money. As good as told me so. Well, let's hope she's got some. It can be hard to tell sometimes. You know, it's crazy. I was married to Leo for so many years, but... I never did this before. I never really understood. Gina : There's nothing else quite like it. Doing this together made us who we were. I never really understood why he ever left you. Mmh. Why would the rich man leave his wife for a younger, beautiful woman? Mmh. [CHUCKLES] No, I'm serious. I mean, I know how I felt about him, but you had all this. We did it, Sam. Together. Yes, we did. I know you needed it. Suzy told me. Well? Well, the Penrose lives to fight another day. For the next month, at least. [CHUCKLES] You don't really care, do you? Whether it makes a panning. This is what he really loved the most. The chaos and the craziness. Maybe that what I've been missing. A little crazy. Maybe you just miss him. Leo :  I did fall in love with her. Problem was, I loved Gina, too. An unstoppable force met an immovable object. And that can cause problems. To say the least. Teresa : Ooh! Michael : Ah!
